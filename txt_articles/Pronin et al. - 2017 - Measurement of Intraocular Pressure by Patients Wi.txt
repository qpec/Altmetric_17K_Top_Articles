 Measurement of Intraocular Pressure
by Patients With Glaucoma
Savva Pronin, BSc; Lyndsay Brown, MSc; Roly Megaw, FRCOphth, PhD; Andrew J. Tatham, FRCOphth
IMPORTANCE The ability of patients to measure their own intraocular pressure (IOP) would
allow more frequent measurements and better appreciation of peak IOP and IOP fluctuation.
OBJECTIVE To examine whether patients with glaucoma can perform self-tonometry using a
rebound tonometer and examine patient acceptability.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS An observational study in which IOP was assessed using
Goldmann applanation tonometry and a rebound tonometer. Consecutive patients were
provided with a patient information sheet and those consenting to take part in the study
received standardized self-tonometry training and were then instructed to measure their own
IOP under observation. This study was conducted at a glaucoma clinic at a university hospital
from March 1, 2016, to December 30, 2016, and included both eyes of 100 patients with
glaucoma or ocular hypertension.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The percentage of patients who could successfully perform
self-tonometry. Complete success was defined by a good technique and an IOP reading
within 5 mm Hg of that obtained by a clinician using the same device. A 3-item questionnaire
was used to examine perceptions of self-tonometry among patients.
RESULTS Among the 100 patients, the mean (SD) age was 67.5 (10.9) years (53% female). A
total 73 of 100 patients (73%) met the complete success criteria. An additional 6 patients
could use the device but had IOP readings greater than 5 mm Hg different from those
obtained by the clinician. On average, IOP by the rebound tonometer was 2.66 mm Hg lower
than Goldmann applanation tonometry (95% limits of agreement, −3.48 to 8.80 mm Hg).
The IOPs with the rebound tonometer were similar whether obtained by self-tonometry or
investigator, with excellent reproducibility with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.903
(95% CI, 0.867-0.928). A total of 56 of 79 successful or partially successful patients (71%) felt
self-tonometry was easy, with 73 of 79 (92%) reporting self-tonometry to be comfortable,
and a similar number happy to perform self-tonometry in the future.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Most patients could perform self-tonometry and the method
was acceptable to patients. Self-tonometry has the potential to improve patient engagement,
while also providing a more complete picture of IOP changes over time.

 T
he major risk factor for development and progression
of glaucoma is elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), with
Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT) the reference
standard for measurement. However, conventional tonom-
etry has limitations because the patient must go to their cli-
nician for measurements and thus readings tend to be ob-
tained infrequently. The result is poor understanding of peak
IOP and IOP fluctuation. Although the significance of diurnal
and long-term IOP fluctuations remains uncertain, it is unsat-
isfactorytobasetreatmentdecisionsonasmallnumberofmea-
surements of what is a highly dynamic variable.
A fuller understanding of IOP fluctuation can be assessed
by admitting patients for repeat measurements; however, this
is logistically difficult, especially as up to 75% of individuals
have peak IOP outside office hours.1 A potential, more
accessible, solution is for patients to measure their own IOP
by self-tonometry. Home monitoring and application of
patient-generated data are not new and have been success-
fully used in other conditions (eg, hypertension and
diabetes).2 Recently, a novel device designed for home IOP
monitoring has become available, the Icare HOME (TA022;
Icare Finland Oy).
TheIcareHOMEisareboundtonometerthatquantifiesIOP
bymeasuringthedecelerationofamagnetizeddisposableprobe
as it rebounds from the surface of the cornea. The device does
not require instillation of topical anesthesia and has been re-
portedtoproviderepeatablereadingswithgoodagreementwith
GAT.3-7 However, testing one’
s own IOP may be technically
difficult,8,9 and it is not certain whether self-tonometry is ac-
ceptable to patients. The aim of this study was to determine
whetherpatientswithglaucomacanmeasuretheirownIOPand
to evaluate patients’perceptions of self-tonometry.
Methods
Conducted from March 1, 2016, to December 30, 2016, this was
anobservationalstudyinvolvingbotheyesof100patientswith
glaucoma or ocular hypertension recruited from the glau-
coma clinic at Princess Alexandra Eye Pavilion, University of
Edinburgh, Scotland. The study methods, which adhered to
the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki,10 were prospec-
tively approved by West Scotland Research Ethics Commit-
tee.Writteninformedconsentwasobtainedprospectivelyfrom
all patients. The sample size was chosen based on a previous
studyreporting75%ofpatientscouldperformself-tonometry.8
A sample size of 75 was calculated as sufficient to demon-
strate this proportion of successful patients (±10%) with 95%
confidence.11
Patients and Study Procedures
Consecutive patients attending the glaucoma clinic were pro-
vided with a patient information sheet and those consenting
to take part in the study had a comprehensive ophthalmo-
logic examination including best-corrected visual acuity, slit-
lamp biomicroscopy, gonioscopy, measurement of central cor-
neal thickness (CCT) (Accutome PachPen; Keeler), and dilated
fundus examination and standard automated perimetry (SAP)
(Humphrey Field Analyzer; Carl Zeiss Meditec) using Swed-
ish interactive threshold algorithm (SITA standard 24-2). In-
traocular pressure was measured using GAT.
Glaucoma was defined by the presence of a repeatable vi-
sual field defect (>2 consecutive) on SAP, defined as a pattern
SD outside 95% normal confidence limits or an abnormal glau-
comahemifieldtest,inconjunctionwithglaucomatousappear-
anceoftheopticnerveonfundoscopicexamination.Visualfields
with more than 33% fixation losses or false-negative errors, or
more than 15% false-positive errors, were excluded. Ocular hy-
pertension was defined as IOP greater than 21 mm Hg on GAT
with a normal SAP and optic nerve appearance. Only patients
with no previous experience of self-tonometry were included.
Exclusion criteria included a known diagnosis of dementia or
inability to hold the Icare HOME owing to upper limb weakness
or disability. Patients with corneal disease that might affect to-
nometry measurements were also excluded.
All patients had IOP measured in both eyes using GAT by
an experienced glaucoma specialist followed by Icare HOME
measurements performed by investigators masked to the re-
sults of previous tests. Patients were then taught to measure
their own IOP using Icare HOME using a standardized training
protocol(eFigureintheSupplement).8,12Briefly,thetrainingses-
sion consisted of familiarizing the patient with the Icare HOME
tonometer, explaining the user interface, loading a disposable
probe, demonstrating adjustment of the measurement dis-
tance from the instrument to the eye, demonstrating tonom-
etry in both eyes, and guiding the patient to obtain a measure-
ment from their own eye, with steps repeated until the patient
could demonstrate consistent and reliable use of the device.
Trainingwaslimitedtoamaximumof30minuteswiththetime
recordedatwhichpointtechniquewasdeemedacceptable.The
patient was then asked to measure their own IOP. Icare HOME
calculates IOP as the average of 4 readings from 6 measure-
ments, with the highest and lowest measurements discarded.
Measurement quality was graded automatically by the device
from 1 to 4, with 1 being the highest quality and measurements
with a quality score greater than 3 automatically rejected. All
patients were masked to all IOP measurements.
Complete success was defined as correct use of the Icare
HOME and obtaining an IOP within 5 mm Hg of that obtained
by the investigator using the same device in both eyes. The
Key Points
Question Are patients with glaucoma able to measure their own
intraocular pressure using a rebound tonometer?
Findings This study of 100 patients found that 73% could
perform self-tonometry using a rebound tonometer and obtain
intraocular pressure measurements within 5 mm Hg of a clinician.
Self-tonometry was judged easy and comfortable by most
patients; most were happy to perform self-tonometry in the
future.
Meaning These data suggest that self-tonometry offers a feasible
method for measuring intraocular pressure fluctuations in
glaucoma.

 5–mm Hg value was chosen as the cutoff for success in accor-
dance with the manufacturer’
s guideline and, as the Interna-
tional Organization for Standardization recommends, tonom-
eters should be accurate to within 5 mm Hg of measurements
obtained by GAT.13 Although we compared Icare HOME and
GAT measurements, rather than define a patient’
s ability to
use the Icare HOME based on comparison with GAT, we
opted to compare with Icare HOME measurements obtained
by the clinician. Partial success was defined when the patient
was deemed to have a good technique for self-tonometry but
obtained an IOP measurement greater than 5 mm Hg from
the investigator. Patients were then asked to complete a
3-item 5-point Likert scale questionnaire regarding their per-
ception of home tonometry including the questions: (1) How
easy was the device to use? (2) How comfortable was it to
take measurements? (3) Would you be happy to use this
device in the future?
Statistical Analysis
Differences between successful and unsuccessful patients
were assessed using the t test and Mann-Whitney U test for
continuous parametric and nonparametric variables, respec-
tively. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression was
used to analyze possible predictors of successful self-
tonometry. Data from paired eyes are likely to be correlated
so an adjustment was made in the regression analysis for the
inclusion of both eyes to generate cluster-robust standard
errors. Bland-Altman plots were used to evaluate agreement
between Icare HOME and GAT IOP measurements, with
analyses conducted to determine 95% limits of agreement
throughout the range of measurements. The presence of pro-
portional bias was determined by regression of the differ-
ence, with the average of the 2 methods. Reproducibility of
measurements was examined using the intraclass correlation
coefficient (ICC). All statistical analyses were performed with
commercially available software (STATA, version 14.2; Stata-
Corp LP). The α level (type I error) was set at .05.
Results
Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients
included in the study are summarized in Table 1. A total of
73 of 100 patients (73%) achieved complete success, with an
additional 6 partially successful, leaving 21 of 100 patients
(21%) unsuccessful. For those partially or completely suc-
cessful, the mean (SD) IOP by self-tonometry was 11.74
(4.89) mm Hg compared with 11.62 (4.61) mm Hg when the
investigator used Icare HOME (Figure, A) and 14.22 (3.96)
mm Hg with GAT (Figure, B). Comparison of Icare HOME
IOP measurements by self-tonometry and investigator indi-
cated excellent reproducibility, with an ICC of 0.903 (95%
CI, 0.867-0.928). The mean (SD) Icare HOME quality score
of accepted measures was 1 (0.7).
The mean (SD) error between Icare HOME readings taken
by the investigator and GAT was 2.66 (3.13) mm Hg, indicat-
ing a systemic underestimation of 2.66 mm Hg with Icare
HOME, very similar to that between GAT and Icare HOME
IOP readings from self-tonometry (Table 2). However, there
was also evidence of proportional bias (coefficient = −0.194;
95% CI, −0.088 to −0.300; R2 = 0.062; P < .001), with a
greater difference between readings found in eyes with
lower IOP. Icare HOME self-tonometry readings from the 165
eyes with partial or complete success had a similar underes-
timation compared with GAT (mean [SD], 2.58 [3.72] mm Hg;
95% limits of agreement of −4.71 mm Hg [95% CI, −5.28 to
−4.14 mm Hg] to 9.88 mm Hg [95% CI, 9.31 to 10.45 mm Hg],
also with proportional bias [coefficient = −0.234; 95% CI,
−0.098 to −0.370; R2 = 0.066; P < .001]). Thinner CCT was
associated with lower IOP measurements using GAT (0.29
mm Hg lower IOP [95% CI, 0.14-0.43] for each 10-μm thinner
CCT; R2 = 0.077; P < .001); however, Icare HOME measure-
ments were affected more (0.48 mm Hg lower IOP [95% CI,
0.30-0.63]) for each 10-μm thinner CCT; R2 = 0.135;
P < .001).

Discussion
This study demonstrates that most patients with glaucoma can
performself-tonometryusingIcareHOMEandobtainIOPmea-
surements close to those of clinicians using the same device.
After a short period of training, 73% of patients could perform
self-tonometry and obtain measurements within 5 mm Hg of a
clinician. Previous studies have reported a similarly high pro-
portion are able to perform self-tonometry.8,9 For example,
Dabasia et al8 found that 74% of patients could successfully use
Icare HOME, and Mudie et al9 reported a similar success rate.
However, the present study goes further by examining patient
perceptions of self-tonometry and factors associated with the
abilitytoperformself-tonometry.Theresultsdemonstrateself-
tonometry is acceptable to patients, with 92% able to perform
self-tonometryreportingtheIcareHOMEtobeeasytouseanda
similar proportion expressing interest in using self-tonometry
in the future. This suggests self-tonometry may be ready to be-
come a mainstream test, with the potential to add a new di-
mension to glaucoma care by providing patient-generated out-
of-office data.
However, for self-tonometry to be useful, it must be repro-
ducible and preferably show good agreement to conventional
tonometry.Wefoundpatientscouldobtainhighlyreproducible
measurements compared with clinicians, with excellent agree-
mentbetweenIcareHOMEIOPmeasurementsobtainedbyself-
tonometryandbyclinicianswithin5mmHgofeachotherin150
of 158 eyes (94.9%), for an ICC of 0.903, similar to the within-
patientICCof0.91(95%CI,0.89-0.94)reportedbyMudieetal.9
Incontrast,wefoundonly88of158self-tonometryIcareHOME
measurements (56%) were within 5 mm Hg of GAT, which
was substantially less than the 84% reported by Mudie et al9
and less than the 84% of Icare HOME measurements within
3 mm Hg of GAT reported by Dabasia et al.8 Reasons for
these differences likely include differences in patient charac-
teristics, including CCT and biomechanical properties of the
cornea, which may affect agreement between GAT and Icare
HOME. We found thinner CCT was associated with lower IOP
measurements using GAT and Icare HOME. However, there
was a stronger relationship between CCT and Icare HOME
measurements. Evaluations of other rebound tonometers
have found a similar trend,4,6,14-18 suggesting rebound
tonometers are affected more by properties of the cornea,
which is a topic that warrants further investigation. Whether
IOP measurements are obtained in the central or peripheral
cornea may also be important, with at least 1 study showing
measurements from the peripheral cornea underestimated
IOP; however, this has not been found by all.19,20
We examined factors associated with the ability to per-
form self-tonometry and found older patients were less likely
to be able to use Icare HOME successfully. It is important to
acknowledge that age itself is not a factor that intrinsically in-
hibits self-tonometry, rather it is likely a surrogate for other
factors such as loss of fine motor function or impaired coor-
dination. Further studies are needed to determine such fac-
tors and evaluate whether modifications to training or tonom-
eter design might facilitate self-tonometry in these patients.
From observing participants and listening to their feedback,
3 obstacles to successful tonometry were identified: (1) diffi-
culty seeing the device when held close to the eye, (2) diffi-
culty holding the device steady, and (3) difficulty applying
enough force to press the button to obtain a measurement.
These problems might be overcome with modifications to the

 tonometer, for example, by including an audible cue to cor-
rect alignment or automatic measurement when the device is
correctly aligned. We found visual acuity and severity of vi-
sual field loss were not strongly associated with ability to per-
form self-tonometry; however, this is likely due to the rela-
tively good visual acuity of included patients.
Limitations
The study has several limitations. Although we found teaching
patientstouseIcareHOMEcanbeperformedinarelativelyshort
time, the method only assessed ability to perform self-
tonometry immediately after teaching; therefore, we cannot
comment on whether the skill is maintained if the device is
taken home. It is possible that patients may forget how to
use the device once taken home or, conversely, become bet-
ter with further practice. It is also possible that those who
struggled to measure their own IOPs may have benefited
from further teaching as the session was limited to 30 min-
utes. It may be impractical to have supervised teaching of a
longer duration in a busy clinical environment, and we
found no relationship between longer teaching time and
ability to perform self-tonometry. Also, the study design was
not randomized and it is possible that selection bias was
introduced by including patients already attending the glau-
coma clinic. We chose to define successful self-tonometry
based on the patient obtaining an IOP measurement within 5
mm Hg of that obtained by a clinician using the same device.
However, previous investigators have suggested that IOP
with self-tonometry should be within 5 mm Hg of IOP with
GAT for a patient to be “certified” as competent.9 Owing to
confounding factors influencing the relationship between
GAT and Icare HOME readings, we would suggest that
instead it would be reasonable to “compare like with like”
and certify based on agreement to Icare HOME measure-
ments obtained by the clinician. Although in clinical practice
a difference of 5 mm Hg between devices could be consid-
ered too great, the good reproducibility of the Icare HOME
measurements could overcome this limitation by allowing
multiple measurements to be taken over time.
Conclusions
The results of this study demonstrate the feasibility of self-
tonometry in patients with glaucoma, with most patients
being able to accurately measure their own IOP after a short
training session. Self-tonometry was deemed comfortable
and relatively easy to perform and has the potential to
improve patient engagement in their own care, while also
providing a more complete picture of IOP changes over
time, which may have significant implications for disease
management.

Invited Commentary
Home Tonometry—Can We? Should We?
Kelly W. Muir, MD, MHS
Lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) is the only intervention
that has been proven to reduce the risk of visual loss from glau-
coma, but as clinicians, we often have few IOP measure-
ments available on which to base our decisions. We know that
IOP varies throughout the
day, but traditional IOP mea-
surements performed in the
clinic only provide us with a
snapshot picture of a continuously changing variable. If pa-
tients with glaucoma could accurately measure their IOP at
home, physicians could make their decisions based on more
IOP data points. With that goal in mind, Pronin and colleagues1
report on the reproducibility and acceptability of self-
monitoring of IOP with the Icare HOME device.
The study included 100 participants with glaucoma or
ocular hypertension. Participants underwent Goldmann ap-
planation tonometry (GAT) by a physician, Icare HOME to-
nometry by a physician masked to the GAT reading, and, af-
ter receiving education regarding device use, performed Icare
HOMEtonometryonthemselvesintheoffice.Participantswere
queried about their acceptability of using the device.
Most of the participants (73 of 100) recorded IOP measure-
ments with the Icare HOME tonometer that was 5 mm Hg or
less different from the readings with Icare HOME performed
by the physician. Readings for IOP by Icare HOME were con-
sistently lower than IOP measurements by GAT, and the dif-
ference appeared to be more pronounced in the lower IOP
range. Most participants reported the act of self-monitoring of
the device to be acceptable when performed once in this way
in the office.
The investigators note important caveats to their find-
ings. Being able to perform the Icare HOME test in the office
immediately after receiving instruction may not translate into
successful testing in the home environment. Also, a differ-
enceof5mmHgorlessmetthecriteriaforsuccessinthisstudy
but might be a difference too great to usefully inform deci-
sion making in the clinical environment.
This study adds to the evidence that home tonometry can
be performed by many patients and is acceptable to most. The
discrepancy between IOP measurements by Icare HOME and
GAT, especially in the lower IOP range, suggest that this
modality of home tonometry may not be appropriate in all
scenarios.
In keeping with the increasing popularity of devices to
measure physical activity, sleep, dietary intake, and other per-
sonalhealthmetrics,patientswithglaucomamaynotonlyfind
self-monitoringofIOPacceptable,butalsosoondemandit.But
just because we can measure something, does not mean that
we always should. Ultimately, we will need to determine
whether self-monitoring leads to less vision loss. It is unclear
that incorporating technology into self-monitoring results in
better clinical outcomes in other chronic diseases such as non–
insulin-dependent diabetes, as evidenced by a recently pub-
lished report from a study comparing remote blood glucose
monitoring with traditional in-clinic visits.2 We will not know
the role of home IOP monitoring in glaucoma management
without carefully designed studies, but research such as this
by Pronin and colleagues1 adds to our understanding in the
field. Because of the ability to take multiple measurements,
andtheabilitytolookatthemeanofthesemeasurements,such
studies could assess how frequently these multiple measure-
ments are an even better representation of a person’
s IOP than
infrequent physician measurements, which have their own
inherent variability.
