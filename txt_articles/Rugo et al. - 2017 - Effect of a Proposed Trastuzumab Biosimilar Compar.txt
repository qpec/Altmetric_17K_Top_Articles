IMPORTANCE Treatment with the anti-ERBB2 humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab
and chemotherapy significantly improves outcome in patients with ERBB2 (HER2)–positive
metastatic breast cancer; a clinically effective biosimilar may help increase access to this therapy.
OBJECTIVE To compare the overall response rate and assess the safety of a proposed
trastuzumab biosimilar plus a taxane or trastuzumab plus a taxane in patients without prior
treatment for ERBB2-positive metastatic breast cancer.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group,
phase 3 equivalence study in patients with metastatic breast cancer. From December 2012 to
August 2015, 500 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive a proposed biosimilar or
trastuzumab plus a taxane. Chemotherapy was administered for at least 24 weeks followed
by antibody alone until unacceptable toxic effects or disease progression occurred.
INTERVENTIONS Proposed biosimilar (n = 230) or trastuzumab (n = 228) with a taxane.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was week 24 overall response rate
(ORR) defined as complete or partial response. Equivalence boundaries were 0.81 to 1.24
with a 90% CI for ORR ratio (proposed biosimilar/trastuzumab) and −15% to 15% with a 95%
CI for ORR difference. Secondary outcome measures included time to tumor progression,
progression-free and overall survival at week 48, and adverse events.
RESULTS Among500womenrandomized,theintention-to-treatpopulationincluded458
women(mean[SD]age,53.6[11.11]years)andthesafetypopulationincluded493women.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among women with ERBB2-positive metastatic breast cancer
receiving taxanes, the use of a proposed trastuzumab biosimilar compared with trastuzumab
resulted in an equivalent overall response rate at 24 weeks. Further study is needed to assess
safety and long-term clinical outcome.

iologicalagents,includingmonoclonalantibodies,have
increased the treatment options and greatly im-
proved outcomes for a number of cancers.1,2 How-
ever, patient access to these biologics is limited in many
countries.3-5 With impending patent expiration of some bio-
logical agents, development of biosimilars has become a high
priority for drug developers and health authorities through-
out the world to provide access to high-quality alternatives.6
Trastuzumab combined with chemotherapy has mark-
edly improved response, progression-free survival (PFS), and
overall survival for ERBB2 (formerly human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2 [HER2] or HER2/neu)–positive metastatic
breast cancer and improved survival in early-stage ERBB2-
positive breast cancer7-9 and metastatic ERBB2-positive gas-
tric cancer compared with chemotherapy alone.10 The effi-
cacy and safety of the proposed trastuzumab biosimilar were
evaluated based on a stepwise approach of physicochemical
and biological characterization, nonclinical, pharmacoki-
netic, and pharmacodynamic studies.11 This phase 3 confir-
matory clinical study (Heritage Study) compared the effi-
cacy, safety, and immunogenicity of the proposed biosimilar
in combination with a taxane vs the reference drug trastu-
zumab in combination with a taxane in patients with measur-
able ERBB2-positive metastatic breast cancer.
Methods
Heritage Study Design and Objectives
This was a multicenter, international, double-blind, random-
ized, parallel-group, phase 3 study comparing the efficacy and
safety of a proposed trastuzumab biosimilar plus a taxane
(docetaxel or paclitaxel by physician choice) vs trastuzumab
plusataxaneinpatientswithERBB2-positivemetastaticbreast
cancer (part 1) (Figure), with continuation of either the pro-
posed biosimilar or trastuzumab for participants who had at
least stable disease to evaluate continued safety and immu-
nogenicity (part 2). In part 1, patients were randomized in a 1:1
ratio to the 2 treatment groups within 3 days prior to cycle 1
(day 1). After completing a minimum of 8 cycles (24 weeks),
participants with at least stable disease (based on radio-
graphic tumor assessments and clinical evaluation) were eli-
gible for part 2. In part 2, patients continued to receive their
originally allocated treatment until the occurrence of disease
progression, unacceptable toxic effects, or death. The results
ofpart1ofthis24-weekstudyarepresentedtogetherwithtime
to tumor progression (TTP), PFS, and overall survival for pa-
tients with 48 weeks of follow-up. The complete results from
part 2 will be presented in a future publication.
This study was conducted in accordance with the Interna-
tional Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements
for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use tripartite guideline on the
ethical principles of good clinical practice (guideline E6) and
applicable regulatory requirements including the archiving of
essential documents. All study patients provided written in-
formedconsent,andpatientswithbreastcancertreatedatstudy
sites had the opportunity to decline participation. The full trial
protocol (available in Supplement 2), the patient information
and consent form, and other relevant study documentation
were approved by the institutional review board or ethics com-
mittee at each study center before initiation of the study. In-
formed consent was obtained in writing from all study partici-
pants prior to enrollment. Race and ethnicity were reported as
part of standard patient demographic data and were classified
by the investigator using predefined options, including Asian,
black/African American, Caucasian, Native Hawaiian/Pacific
Islander, American Indian/Alaskan Native, and other.
Eligibility
Eligible patients were male or female with breast cancer that
was measurably ERBB2 positive (defined as central labora-
tory documentation of ERBB2-positive overexpression by
immunohistochemistry [IHC], ie, IHC3+, or IHC2+ with fluo-
rescent in situ hybridization confirmation [ratio >2]) without
prior exposure to chemotherapy or trastuzumab in the
metastatic setting. Additional eligibility criteria included an
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance
Status of 0 to 2, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)
within institutional range of normal, and at least 1 year since
adjuvant therapy with trastuzumab. Patients with newly
detected central nervous system metastases had to have
stable disease following treatment (eg, radiotherapy, stereo-
tactic radiosurgery). Hormonal agents had to be discontinued
before beginning study therapy. The full inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria are listed in the trial protocol in Supplement 2.
Exclusion criteria included a history of unstable angina,
heart failure, myocardial infarction less than 1 year from ran-
domization,orotherclinicallysignificantcardiacdisease,grade
2 or higher peripheral neuropathy according to the National
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Eventsversion4.03,ahistoryofanyothercancerwithin5years
prior to screening with the exception of in situ cancers or non-
melanomatous skin cancers, or significant medical illness that
would increase the risk of treatment or impede evaluation of
response in the judgment of the treatment physician.
Treatment
Patientswererandomizedina1:1ratiototheproposedbiosimi-
lar plus a taxane or to trastuzumab plus a taxane. A centralized
randomization procedure was used with preallocated blocks.
Key Points
Question Are the effects of a proposed trastuzumab biosimilar
equivalent to those of trastuzumab in the treatment of ERBB2
(formerly HER2 or HER2/neu)–positive metastatic breast cancer?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 458 women,
the overall response rate to the proposed biosimilar plus a taxane at
24 weeks was 69.6% (95% CI, 63.62%-75.51%) compared with
64.0% (95% CI, 57.81%-70.26%) for trastuzumab plus a taxane,
which was within predefined equivalence boundaries.
Meaning Although further assessment is needed to establish
long-term clinical outcomes and safety, the availability of a clinically
effective biosimilar treatment option for trastuzumab may lead to
broader access to this therapy for patients with breast cancer.

A blocking size of 8 was used in the treatment assignment. Pa-
tients were stratified at randomization based on 3 factors, in-
cludingtumorprogressiontometastaticphasein2orfeweryears
or more than 2 years after primary diagnosis, centrally deter-
mined estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status
(≥1 positive or both negative), and type of taxane; each factor
consisted of 2 levels, resulting in a total of 8 stratification com-
binations. Treatment allocation was blinded using an interac-
tive voice response or interactive web response system.
Trastuzumab (Herceptin; Roche Pharma AG) or the pro-
posed biosimilar (MYL-1401O; Mylan) was administered as an
intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. An initial 8-mg/kg load-
ing dose was administered over 90 minutes, followed by dos-
ing every 3 weeks of 6 mg/kg over 30 minutes.
The choice of taxane (docetaxel or paclitaxel) was by in-
vestigator decision at each study site and was applied to all pa-
tients enrolled at that site. Docetaxel was administered at
75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks and paclitaxel at 80 mg/m2 weekly.
Paclitaxel could be omitted by investigator choice for 1 week
every 4 weeks.

treatment cycles; trastuzumab was continued every 3 weeks
until disease progression occurred.

Informatics, and tumor measurements were performed by
blinded reviewers using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 criteria. Responses were con-
firmed with a second tumor assessment at least 4 weeks after
the first response.
End Points
The primary end point was to compare the objective overall
response rate (ORR), defined as complete or partial response
by RECIST version 1.1 criteria12 at week 24.
Secondary end points analyzed at week 48 included TTP,
defined as the time from randomization to the date of first
documentation of objective progression; PFS, defined as the
time from randomization to first documentation of objective
progression or to death due to any cause; and overall sur-
vival, defined as the time from randomization to the date of
deathduetoanycause.Analysesofthesesecondaryendpoints
were not adjusted for multiplicity and should therefore be in-
terpreted as exploratory.
Other end points evaluated at both 24 and 48 weeks
included adverse events, laboratory assessments, LVEF, and
immunogenicity. Population pharmacokinetic end points
included area under the curve, maximum drug concentra-
tion, and minimum drug concentration. All end point assess-
ments were blinded to group assignment.
The investigator was responsible for the detection and
documentation of events meeting the criteria and definition
of an adverse event. At each visit the participant was asked to
report any issues, and the investigator evaluated and moni-
toredanyreportedevent.Clinicallyrelevantobservationsmade
by the investigator during the visit were also considered to be
an adverse event. Treatment-emergent adverse events, de-
fined as events that began or worsened at or after treatment
with the investigational drug and on or within 28 days follow-
ing the last dose of investigational drug, were the adverse
events of interest in this study.

Statistical Analysis
The primary efficacy analysis was conducted in the intention-
to-treat (ITT) population (all patients randomized after
the amendment as defined in the Figure). Patients with
missing data or who were lost to follow-up were categorized
based on best response at 24 weeks or at the time of the last
tumor assessment. If no response data were available, pa-
tients were included as nonresponders. The safety popula-
tion included all participants who received at least 1 dose of
study drug in any amount.
The pharmacokinetic population included all randomized
patientswhoreceivedatleast1completedoseofstudydrugand
who provided at least 1 postdose sample for pharmacokinetic
analysis. The population pharmacokinetic analysis was based
on the pharmacokinetic population. A population pharmaco-
kinetic model was developed using a 2-compartment linear
model including assessment of covariate effects on the inter-
individual variability in pharmacokinetic parameters. The ef-
fect of ERBB2 extracellular domain on trastuzumab pharma-
cokinetic levels was evaluated as part of the primary covariate
analysis. Observed minimum drug concentration values at the
end of cycle 1 and cycle 6 were used to assess the similarity of
the proposed biosimilar vs trastuzumab using the 2 one-sided
t tests statistical approach for bioequivalence.
SAS version 9.3 statistical software (SAS Institute Inc) was
used to analyze the data from this study. The statistical analy-
sis plan is provided in Supplement 3.
Primary Efficacy Analysis
The primary efficacy end point was ORR based on central
imaging evaluation. Per US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) recommendation (internal written communication with
FDA, April 25, 2012), the equivalence analysis was based on
the ratio of ORRs with a 90% confidence interval. To com-
pare the primary efficacy end point for the 2 treatment groups,
the ratio of the ORRs at week 24 was assessed for statistical
significance.
A 2-sided 90% confidence interval for the ratio of ORRs
at week 24 was calculated based on the method of logarith-
mic transformation with no adjustment for covariates. The
2-sided 90% confidence interval was equivalent to 2 one-
sidedtestsatthe5%level.Equivalencewasdeclaredifthecon-
fidence interval was completely within the equivalence range
of 0.81 to 1.24. A 2-sided 95% confidence interval was also cal-
culated for exploratory purposes.
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) requested that the
difference in ORRs be used as the primary efficacy analysis,
using a 95% confidence interval (internal written communi-
cation with EMA, March 15, 2013). A 2-sided 95% confidence
interval for the difference of the ORRs at week 24 was calcu-
lated. Equivalence was declared if the confidence interval was
completely within the equivalence range of −15% to 15%.
The equivalence margins for ORR were derived based on
meta-analysisofORRfrompreviousrandomizedtrials.13-15The
final clinical justification was determined by relating ORR with
PFS using the weighted least squares regression model.
Through the weighted least squares regression model, the
boundaries of the equivalence margins correspond to a devia-
tion of 1.9 months or less from a median PFS of 12 months,
which was not considered to be clinically meaningful.
Secondary Efficacy Analysis
Secondary end points included TTP, PFS (centrally con-
firmed),andoverallsurvival(investigatorassessed)atweek48.
Kaplan-Meier plots by treatment and the unadjusted log-rank
test for any covariates were performed. Cox proportional
hazards model was used to analyze for treatment effects, ad-
justing for subgroup. Univariate analysis and multivariate
analysis with forward selection were performed. Hazard ra-
tios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated.
Sample Size Calculation
Per FDA recommendation, the equivalence analysis was based
on the ratio of ORRs using historical randomized trastuzumab
trials13-15 with a fixed-effects meta-analysis (statistical analy-
sis plan in Supplement 3) to estimate the treatment effect of
trastuzumab plus chemotherapy vs chemotherapy alone.
Samplesizesof410patientsfortheFDA-recommendedend
point and 400 patients for the EMA-recommended end point
were required to provide at least 80% power to declare the pro-
posed biosimilar equivalent to trastuzumab in the analysis of
ORR at week 24. These sample sizes assumed that both treat-
ment groups would exhibit an ORR of 69% at week 24,16 that
the ratio of ORR for the proposed biosimilar to trastuzumab
wouldbeanalyzedwitha2-sided90%confidenceinterval,and
thatthedifferencebetweenthe2groupswouldbeanalyzedwith
a 2-sided 95% confidence interval. Therefore, a sample size of
410patientswaschosentosatisfytherecommendationsofboth
regulatory agencies for equivalence analysis. To arrive at the
plannednumberofpatients,therequiredsamplesizeof410was
increased to 456 to reflect an estimated 10% attrition rate.
Additional Analysis
Adescriptionofthesecondaryefficacyanalysis,includingTTP,
PFS, overall survival, immunogenicity, population pharma-
cokinetics,andsafety,isprovidedinthestatisticalanalysisplan
(Supplement 3). Sensitivity and exploratory analyses are also
described in the statistical analysis plan (Supplement 3).
To evaluate site-specific effects, an unplanned mixed-
effectanalysiswasperformed.Specifically,thegeneralizedlin-
ear mixed model (Proc GLIMMIX in SAS) was fit with ORR as
the response variable, site as random effect, and the other fac-
tors or covariates (treatment, age, race, previous adjuvant or
neoadjuvant chemotherapy or HER2-targeted treatment [yes
or no], number of visceral metastases, number of metastatic
sites, central nervous system as first site of metastasis, and
stratification factor) as fixed effects.
Protocol Amendment
A protocol amendment changed eligibility criteria after 42 pa-
tients were enrolled to exclude patients who had already re-
ceived first-line therapy based on steering committee recom-
mendations to include a homogeneous patient population.
These patients were excluded from the primary ITT analysis
population (see protocol amendments in the trial protocol in
Supplement 2).

Patient Demographics, Disease History,
and Baseline Characteristics
At a total of 95 sites in Bulgaria, Chile, Czech Republic, Georgia,
Hungary, India, Latvia, Philippines, Poland, Romania, Russia,
Serbia, Slovakia, South Africa, Thailand, and Ukraine, 500 pa-
tients with ERBB2-positive metastatic breast cancer were en-
rolled between December 10, 2012, and August 5, 2015 (last
follow-up visit January 25, 2016) (Figure). Forty-two patients
(proposed biosimilar, n = 19; trastuzumab, n = 23) were ex-
cluded as ineligible after the protocol amendment. The num-
ber of patients enrolled per site ranged from 1 to 28 (median,
3 patients; interquartile range, 5 patients [25th percentile, 2 pa-
tients; 75th percentile, 7 patients]) (eTable in Supplement 1).
Demographic characteristics were similar for patients in the
proposed trastuzumab biosimilar and trastuzumab groups.
Disease history and baseline characteristics were comparable
in both treatment groups and no clinically relevant differ-
ences were observed (Table 1).
Among the 458 women in the ITT population, the mean
(SD) age was 53.6 (11.11) years (median age, 55 years; range,
26-82 years), with a median age of 55 years (range, 26-79 years)
for the proposed biosimilar group and 54 years (range, 26-82
years)forthetrastuzumabgroup.Themajorityofpatientswere
white (69.1% in the proposed biosimilar group vs 67.5% in the
trastuzumab group), followed by Asian (30.4% in the pro-
posed biosimilar group vs 31.6% in the trastuzumab group). All
patients were female.
Tumors were estrogen receptor negative and progester-
one receptor negative in 55.7% of patients in both treatment
groups. A higher percentage of patients in the proposed bio-
similar group had an ECOG Performance Status of 0 compared
with the trastuzumab group (51.4% vs 43.5%, respectively).
Among patients with ERBB2 extracellular domain values avail-
able, baseline values for ERBB2 extracellular domain were
higher in the trastuzumab group compared with the proposed
biosimilargroup(ERBB2extracellulardomain≥15ng/mLin162
of 222 patients [73.0%] in the proposed biosimilar group vs 172
of 218 patients [78.9%] of the trastuzumab group). Stratifica-
tion of patients at randomization by type of taxane resulted in
similar distribution between treatment groups of docetaxel
(83.9% in the proposed biosimilar group and 84.2% in the
trastuzumab group) and paclitaxel (15.2% in the proposed bio-
similar group and 14.0% in the trastuzumab group).
Patient Disposition
Of the 230 patients in the ITT population randomized to the
proposed biosimilar group, 173 (75.2%) completed all 24 weeks
of therapy. Patient disposition is summarized in the Figure. Of
the 228 patients in the trastuzumab group in the ITT popula-
tion, 159 (69.7%) completed 24 weeks of therapy. In the pro-
posedbiosimilarandtrastuzumabgroups,respectively,thepri-
maryreasonfordiscontinuationwasdiseaseprogression(17.8%
vs 22.4%), followed by withdrawal of consent (0.4% vs 3.1%)
and death (2.6% vs 1.3%). In the ITT population, only 1.7% of
participants in the proposed biosimilar group and 0.9% in the
trastuzumab group discontinued owing to an adverse event.
Primary Efficacy Analysis
The results of the primary efficacy analysis are summarized
in Table 2. The ORR was 69.6% (160 of 230 patients) (95% CI,
63.62%-75.51%) in the proposed biosimilar group and 64.0%
(146 of 228 patients) (95% CI, 57.81%-70.26%) in the trastu-
zumab group.
The ratio of the ORR (proposed biosimilar to trastuzumab)
was 1.09 (90% CI, 0.974-1.211). The 90% CI was within the pre-
defined equivalence boundaries of 0.81 to 1.24, consistent
with statistical therapeutic equivalence of proposed biosimilar
and trastuzumab. For the same ratio of 1.09, the 95% CI of the
ORR ratio between proposed biosimilar and trastuzumab,

a Response criteria were based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
version 1.1 criteria. Complete response indicates disappearance of all target
lesions; partial response, at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest
diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest
diameter; stable disease, neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial
response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as
reference the smallest sum longest diameter since the treatment started; and
progressive disease, at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded
since the treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions.

within the equivalence boundaries.
The difference in ORR (proposed biosimilar minus trastu-
zumab) was 5.53 (95% CI, −3.08 to 14.04). This 95% CI was also
withinthepredefinedequivalenceboundariesof−15%and15%,
consistent with statistical therapeutic equivalence of pro-
posed biosimilar and trastuzumab per EMA recommendation.
The primary efficacy analysis for ORR was also replicated
intheperprotocolpopulation(n = 438).Theratiobetweenboth
treatment groups (proposed biosimilar to trastuzumab) was
1.06 (90% CI, 0.954 to 1.178).
Secondary Efficacy Analyses
The 48-week exploratory findings of the secondary efficacy
analysis are summarized in Table 3.
Time to Tumor Progression
In the proposed biosimilar group, 95 patients (41.3%) had tu-
morprogressionatweek48comparedwith98patients(43.0%)
in the trastuzumab group. According to the log-rank test, this
difference was not statistically significant (−1.7%; 95% CI,
−11.1% to 6.9%; P = .68). Hazard ratios for TTP for the pro-
posed biosimilar group compared with the trastuzumab group
by Cox proportional hazards model were 0.94 (95% CI, 0.712
to 1.254) (unstratified) and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.692 to 1.231) (strati-
fied). There was no statistically significant difference in TTP
between the proposed biosimilar and trastuzumab groups.
Progression-Free Survival
In PFS, the rate of events at week 48 for the proposed bio-
similar group was 44.3% compared with 44.7% for trastu-
zumab, a difference of −0.4% (95% CI, −9.4% to 8.7%;
P = .84) by log-rank test. Hazard ratios for PFS for the pro-
posed biosimilar group compared with the trastuzumab
group obtained from the Cox proportional hazards model
were 0.97 (95% CI, 0.740 to 1.282) (unstratified) and 0.95
(95% CI, 0.714 to 1.251) (stratified). There was no statistically
significant difference in PFS between the proposed biosimilar
and trastuzumab groups.
Overall Survival
Regardingoverallsurvival,intheproposedbiosimilargroup,205
patients (89.1%) survived at week 48 compared with 194 pa-
tients(85.1%)inthetrastuzumabgroup;thisdifferenceof4.0%
(95% CI, −2.1% to 10.3%; P = .13) was not statistically signifi-
cant by log-rank test. Hazard ratios for the proposed biosimilar
groupcomparedwiththetrastuzumabgroupobtainedfromthe
Cox proportional hazards model were 0.67 (95% CI, 0.402 to
1.129) (unstratified) and 0.61 (95% CI, 0.360 to 1.039) (strati-
fied). At 48 weeks, more than 50% of patients had not shown
progression; therefore, the median in the time event efficacy
parameters may be longer at longer data cutoff.
The median Kaplan-Meier estimates for TTP and PFS at 48
weeks were 11.1 months for both groups. At 48 weeks, fewer
than 50% patients had disease progression; therefore, the me-
dian in the time event efficacy parameters may be longer in
lateranalyses.Themedianforoverallsurvivalwasnotreached.

variation of response to attribute variation to random effect,
controlling for everything else in the model. In addition, type
III test results showed that all fixed effects in the model were
not significant, with P > .11.
Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis
In the pharmacokinetic population, the mean concentrations
of trastuzumab from the 2 treatments were similar (eFigure
in Supplement 1). Trough (minimum) drug concentrations
were comparable between the treatment groups at cycle 6
(week 15). In the proposed biosimilar and trastuzumab
groups, geometric least squares means were 34.011 and
32.740 μg/mL, respectively, with a ratio of 103.88% (90% CI,
93.7%-115.11%). Dose-normalized mean maximum drug con-
centrations were 0.4321 and 0.4196 μg/mL/mg, respectively,
while dose-normalized mean areas under the curve were
98.350 and 94.391 μg ·d/mL/mg, respectively, with a coeffi-
cient of variation ranging from 21.87% to 31.06%; both of
these parameters were comparable.
Safety Evaluation
Extent of Exposure
The extent of exposure was similar between the 2 treatment
groups in terms of dose and duration of exposure. The mean
(SD) loading dose was 8.0 (0) mg/kg in both treatment groups
with similar subsequent dose intensity (2.011 mg/kg/wk for

the proposed biosimilar and 2.028 mg/kg/wk for trastu-
zumab). For part 1, the mean (SD) total exposure was 21.038
(6.4383) weeks for the proposed biosimilar and 20.327
(6.8221) weeks for trastuzumab. The mean (SD) number of
cycles received was 7.8 (2.13) for the proposed biosimilar
group and 7.5 (2.27) for the trastuzumab group.
Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events
The overall incidence of patients with at least 1 treatment-
emergent adverse event was 96.8% (n = 239) in the proposed
biosimilargroupand94.7%(n = 233)inthetrastuzumabgroup.
The majority of events were mild or moderate in severity in
both treatment groups. In the safety population, a total of 14
participants (7 patients [2.8%] in each group) reported an ad-
verse event leading to discontinuation of treatment.
The incidence rates of treatment-emergent adverse events
of neutropenia, leukopenia, and anemia were 57.5% (n = 142),
17.0% (n = 42), and 16.2% (n = 40), respectively, in the pro-
posed biosimilar group and 53.3% (n = 131), 20.7% (n = 51), and
16.3% (n = 40), respectively, in the trastuzumab group. Ad-
verse events with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events grade 3 or higher were reported for 312 (63.3%) of all
participants, with neutropenia (221 patients [44.8%]) and leu-
kopenia (69 patients [14.0%]) the most frequently reported.
The most frequent nonhematologic treatment-emergent ad-
verse events in patients in the proposed biosimilar and trastu-
zumab groups, respectively, included peripheral neuropathy
(57 [23.1%] and 61 [24.8%]), diarrhea (51 [20.6%] and 51
[20.7%]), asthenia (54 [21.9%] and 40 [16.3%]), and nausea (49
[19.8%] and 34 [13.8%]). Common Terminology Criteria for Ad-
verse Events grade 3 events were reported for less than 2% of
all participants with these nonhematologic events. Treatment-
emergent adverse events are summarized in Table 4.
Serious Adverse Events
The overall incidence of patients with at least 1 serious ad-
verse event (SAE) was 38.1% (n = 94) in the proposed biosimi-
lar group and 36.2% (n = 89) in the trastuzumab group
(Table 4).
Only 4 SAE preferred terms were reported in at least 2%
in either treatment group (Table 4). Overall, the most fre-
quently reported SAE terms were neutropenia (130 patients
[26.4%]), febrile neutropenia (21 patients [4.3%]), and leuko-
penia (16 [3.2%]). No other SAEs were reported in at least 2%
of participants.
Eight participants (4 in each group) had SAEs that re-
sulted in death. One death due to respiratory failure in each
group was considered “possibly related” to study drug. Other
adverse events with fatal outcome were considered related to
taxane therapy, related to underlying or progressive disease,
or of unknown etiology.
Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction
The LVEF values at baseline in the proposed biosimilar group
(median, 64.0%; range, 51%-82%) and in the trastuzumab
group (median, 63.0%; range, 51%-84%) did not change ap-
preciably at week 24 (proposed biosimilar group: median,
−1.0%;range,−13%to21%;trastuzumabgroup:median,−1.0%;
range, −19% to 13%) (Table 5).
Immunogenicity
Fourteen participants (5.9%) in the proposed biosimilar group
and 21 participants (8.9%) in the trastuzumab group were posi-
tive for antidrug antibody prior to exposure to study treat-
ment. The number of patients with detectable antibody de-
clined over time.
Using a conservative approach that considers all patients
who tested positive for antidrug antibody at least once at any
timepointafterbaselineregardlessoftheantidrugantibodyre-
sult at baseline, the overall antidrug antibody rate was 2.4%

75.51%) for the proposed biosimilar and 64.0% (146 of 228 pa-
tients) (95% CI, 57.81%-70.26%) for trastuzumab.
Treatment with the anti-ERBB2 humanized monoclonal
antibody trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy,
compared with chemotherapy alone, significantly improved
PFS and overall survival among patients with ERBB2-positive
metastatic breast cancer.14,15 However, trastuzumab is not
widely available around the world.4 A biosimilar treatment
option may increase global access to biological cancer thera-
pies, provided, among other issues, that the price of the bio-
similar is sufficiently inexpensive to enable women in non–
high-income countries to access this therapy.6,17,18
A biosimilar drug is a biological product that is highly simi-
lar to a licensed biological product, with no clinically mean-

ies, including assessments of toxicity. The nature and extent
of data required for regulatory approval are determined on a
product-specific basis and depend on the level of evidence ob-
tained in the preceding steps.
This confirmatory efficacy and safety study was the last
step in the multistep process to demonstrate similarity of a
trastuzumab biosimilar and was adequately powered to dem-
onstrate equivalence with trastuzumab. Pertuzumab (a HER2
dimerization inhibitor) was not added to the treatment
groups in this study owing to the lack of worldwide availabil-
ity of this antibody; the equivalence comparison predated
pertuzumab approval.16 The results of this study are consis-
tent with the physicochemical and functional similarity
shown in vitro and in vivo and with the similar pharmacoki-
netics shown in healthy participants between the candidate
biosimilar and trastuzumab.11
At week 24, the ORR was 69.6% in the proposed trastu-
zumab biosimilar group and 64.0% in the trastuzumab group.
Therapeutic equivalence of the proposed trastuzumab bio-
similar and trastuzumab was statistically supported by the pri-
mary efficacy as well as the results of sensitivity analysis in
the per protocol population. Additionally, the ORR data were
consistent with the published data for trastuzumab.16,22,23 All
secondary efficacy analyses (TTP, PFS, and overall survival)
at week 24 and PFS and overall survival in patients followed
up for at least 48 weeks supported the conclusion of thera-
peutic equivalence.
There were no notable differences between the treat-
ment groups with regard to the type, incidence, or severity
of treatment-emergent adverse events or between the inci-
dence and type of SAEs reported. The population pharma-
cokinetic analysis was consistent with the findings from
studies in healthy volunteers11 that demonstrated similar
pharmacokinetics between the proposed biosimilar and
trastuzumab.
The immunogenicity profile was low, similar between
the 2 products and consistent with published data with
trastuzumab showing a low immunogenic potential. Base-
line positivity for antidrug antibody in a small number of
patients is expected. A similar positive rate was observed in
previous reports and may be due to potential cross-reactivity
with preexisting antibodies and the test’
s high sensitivity
level (previous trastuzumab treatments, high level of extra-
cellular domain).24,25 Potential interference of trastuzumab
with the antitrastuzumab antibody detection assay needs to
be considered when assessing the results from posttreat-
ment samples, although the assay was designed to minimize
these effects.
This study was designed to assess efficacy and safety in a
biosimilar development program in which there is an under-
lyingpresumptionthatamoleculeshowntobestructurallyand
functionally highly similar to a reference product is antici-
pated to behave like the reference product in the clinical
setting.6 The limitations of this study are consistent with the
planned development of biosimilars, which uses short-term
efficacy end points as the final step in assessing biosimilarity.
The choice of the 24-week evaluation period for part 1 of this
study was related to the ability to analyze the ORR as a short-
term measure of clinical activity and safety directly related to
the combination of taxanes with trastuzumab and the pro-
posed biosimilar as first-line treatment. This report includes
the 48-week TTP, PFS, and overall survival, which add to the
efficacy end point assessment. Ongoing follow-up will assess

Conclusions
Among women with ERBB2-positive metastatic breast can-
cer receiving taxanes, the use of a proposed trastuzumab bio-
similar compared with trastuzumab resulted in an equivalent
overall response rate at 24 weeks. Further study is needed to
assess safety and long-term clinical outcome.
