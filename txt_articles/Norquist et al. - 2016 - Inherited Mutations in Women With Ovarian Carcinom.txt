Abstract
Importance—Germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are relatively common in women with 
ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal carcinoma (OC) causing a greatly increased lifetime risk of 
these cancers, but the frequency and relevance of inherited mutations in other genes is less well 
characterized.
Objective—To determine the frequency and importance of germline mutations in cancer-
associated genes in OC.
Design—Subjects were ascertained from two phase III clinical trials in newly diagnosed 
advanced stage OC (GOG 218 and GOG 262), and a university-based gynecologic oncology tissue 
bank. Germline DNA was sequenced from women with OC using the targeted capture and 
multiplex sequencing assay BROCA.
Setting—Referral centers participating in NRG Oncology studies, and a University-based 
gynecologic oncology practice (UW).
Participants—The study population was 1915 women with OC with available germline DNA, 
unselected for age or family history, enrolled at the time of OC diagnosis (GOG 218, N=788; 
GOG 262, N=557; UW, N=570).
Main Outcomes and Measures—Mutation frequencies in OC were compared to the NHLBI 
GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) and the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC). Clinical 
characteristics and survival were assessed by mutation status.
Results—Of 1915 subjects, 280 (15%) had mutations in BRCA1 (182), or BRCA2 (98) and 8 
(0.4%) had mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes. Mutations in BRIP1 (26), RAD51C 
(11), RAD51D (11), PALB2 (12) and BARD1 (4), were significantly more common in OC 
patients than in the ESP or ExAC, and in total were present in 3.3% of patients. Race, histologic 
subtype, and disease site were not predictive of mutation frequency. Mutation status affected 
survival, in particular for BRCA2 mutation carriers with HR 0.60 (95% CI 0.45 – 0.79, p<0.001) 
for progression-free survival, and HR 0.39 (95% CI 0.25 – 0.60, p<0.001) for overall survival in 
the GOG patients.
Conclusions and Relevance—In total, 347/1915 (18%) OC patients carried pathogenic 
germline mutations in genes associated with OC risk. PALB2 and BARD1 are suspected OC genes 
and together with established OC genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, RAD51C, RAD51D, MSH2, 
MLH1, PMS2, and MSH6) bring the total number of genes suspected to cause hereditary OC to 
11.
INTRODUCTION
Ovarian carcinoma (OC) remains the deadliest gynecologic malignancy.1 Identifying genetic 
predisposition offers opportunities for cancer prevention. According to previous studies, 13–
18% of OC is associated with germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2.2–4 BRCA1 and 
BRCA2 mutations confer a lifetime risk of developing OC of approximately 20% (BRCA2)

 to 50% (BRCA1)5 and risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy has been shown to 
significantly reduce the risk of OC and all-cause mortality.6,7 Other genes from the BRCA-
Fanconi anemia pathway such as BRIP1, RAD51C, and RAD51D have been implicated in 
hereditary OC.8–13 We previously reported the frequency of these mutations in a small 
(n=360) set of unselected patients with OC.4 Several publications on a recent large series of 
unselected OC reported lower rates of mutations in all OC genes, perhaps secondary to 
different sequencing methods.12–14 Mutations in other genes within this pathway (PALB2, 
BARD1, NBN, and CHEK2, amongst others) have been identified in OC patients, but it is 
unknown if these mutations confer an elevated risk of OC.4
We sought to determine the frequency of mutations in known or suspected OC susceptibility 
genes in a large unselected group of patients with ovarian, peritoneal, and fallopian tube 
carcinoma, using a comprehensive targeted sequencing method.
METHODS
Patients with primary ovarian, peritoneal, and fallopian tube carcinoma (collectively OC), 
were identified from three sources: 1) patients undergoing primary treatment at the 
University of Washington (UW) Medical Center, 2) patients consented for translational 
research with available DNA from Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) protocol 218, and 
3) GOG protocol 262. Patients were enrolled at diagnosis and were not selected for age or 
family history. Pathology was centrally reviewed by gynecologic pathologists, and unsure 
cases were resolved by consensus. GOG-218 and GOG-262 were large randomized phase III 
trials for primary advanced stage OC. A subset of the UW patients have been previously 
described.4 All patients provided written informed consent on protocols approved by an 
Institutional Review Board.
Germline DNA extracted from blood was sequenced using BROCA, a targeted capture, 
massively parallel sequencing test developed at the University of Washington.15 For this 
study, we sequenced ATM, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CHEK2, FAM175A, 
FANCP, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, MRE11A, NBN, PALB2, PMS2, PTEN, RAD50, 
RAD51C, RAD51D, and TP53. Sequencing reads were aligned to the human reference 
genome (hg19). Variants were identified using GATK37 and Pindel after indel realignment 
and base quality recalibration. Variants including copy number variations (CNVs) were 
detected as previously described.15–17 Missense mutations were only included if proven to 
be damaging (e.g., BRCA1 C61G18). TP53 missense mutations were classified as 
deleterious based on available functional data as per the International Agency for Research 
on Cancer.19
Two publically available, overlapping, online exome sequencing datasets were utilized to 
estimate population mutation frequencies, the European American (EA) dataset from the 
NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (ESP)20, and the Exome Aggregation Consortium 
(ExAC).21 To account for inaccuracy in indel calling in the ESP, we visually inspected the 
read data for all coding indel calls in the ESP dataset for the genes of interest. Low quality 
(< 17) and low coverage (< 5) calls were excluded. The EA group was used as most OC 
subjects were Caucasian and the total ESP population over-represents African Americans.

 ExAC mutation frequencies were weighted to match the racial distribution in OC cases. As 
these exome databases do not include CNVs, CNVs were removed from the OC frequencies 
for this comparison. Splice mutations were also excluded from OC and population mutation 
frequencies as they could not all be verified to be damaging.
Clinical information was collected as per the GOG 218 and 262 protocols, or extracted from 
the medical record for UW patients. Race and ethnicity (self-reported in the GOG patients, 
and as noted in the medical record for UW patients) were assessed to determine if they 
impacted mutation rates.
Contingency tables were analyzed with χ2 or Fisher’s exact test. In GOG patients, 
progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were defined as the time period 
between enrollment and progression22 or death, respectively. Proportional hazards models 
were used to provide estimates of relative hazards adjusted for clinical characteristics 
(further description, as well as the log files of the statistical analyses are available in the 
supplemental materials). Wald’s test was used to assess the null hypotheses of equal hazards. 
All p-values are two-sided.
RESULTS
Description of study population
Clinical characteristics are provided in Table 1. The median age at diagnosis was 60 (range 
28 – 91) in the UW patients and 61 (range 23 – 87) in the GOG patients. Differences 
between the GOG patients versus UW patients included an increased fraction of black 
women in the GOG (4.3% versus 1.4%, p=0.009, Fisher’s exact) and higher proportions in 
the UW series of fallopian tube carcinomas (13.3% versus 5.7%, p<0.001), stage I and II 
disease (14.6% versus 0% as GOG trials were restricted to advanced stage), and non-serous 
carcinomas (29.9% versus 13.1%, p<0.001).
Frequency of mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, and mismatch-repair genes
Of 1,915 patients, 182 (9.5%) had mutations in BRCA1 and 98 (5.1%) had mutations in 
BRCA2. Of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, 38/280 (13.6%) were in Ashkenazi Jewish 
founder mutations, BRCA1 185delAG (c.68_69delAG) (18) and 5382insC (c.5266dupC) 
(14) and BRCA2 6174delT (c.5946delT) (6). 16/182 (8.8%) BRCA1 mutations were large 
genomic duplications or deletions, also called copy number variants (CNVs). 8/1915 (0.4%) 
carried mutations in genes involved in mismatch repair (MMR), including 4 in PMS2, 3 in 
MSH6, and 1 in MLH1. There were no mutations found in MSH2. Mutation frequencies for 
BRCA1, BRCA2, and MMR did not differ by ascertainment. Median coverage was 219 fold.
Mutations in other genes and comparison with population frequency
Mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, PALB2, RAD51C, RAD51D, and BARD1 were all 
significantly more common in women with OC compared to the ESP or ExAC (Table 2) and 
using these data, we categorized these genes together with the MMR genes as the “OC-
associated genes”. Other putative cancer-associated genes such as CHEK2, NBN, RAD50, 
FAM175A, and MRE11A were not more frequently mutated in women with OC.

 Deleterious mutations in ATM and TP53 were more frequent in OC patients when compared 
to ExAC, but this was not significant when compared to the ESP. Odds ratios for OC are 
presented in Table 2. There were no mutations found in PTEN or FANCP.
In total, 347 women with OC (18.1%) had 352 mutations in OC-associated genes: 280 
(14.6%) in BRCA1 or BRCA2, 64 (3.3%) in another BRCA-Fanconi anemia OC-associated 
gene (BRIP1, PALB2, RAD51C, RAD51D, or BARD1), and 8 (0.4%) in an MMR gene. 
5/347 (1.4%) had more than one mutation. Individual mutations and associated clinical data 
for OC-associated genes other than BRCA1 and BRCA2 are provided in eTable 1.
Clinical characteristics and mutation status
OC-associated mutations were categorized as: BRCA1, BRCA2, other BRCA-Fanconi 
anemia OC-associated (BRIP1, PALB2, RAD51C, RAD51D, BARD1), mismatch repair 
(MSH6, PMS2, MSH2, MLH1), and no mutation (either a mutation in a gene not clearly 
associated with OC or no mutation). Women with BRCA1 mutations had an earlier age of 
onset of OC (median 52 [27 – 77]) than those with no mutation (median 62 [23 – 91]), 
p<0.001. BRCA2 mutation carriers had a median age of 59 (41 – 83). Those with mutations 
in other BRCA-Fanconi anemia OC-associated genes had a median age of 60 (34 – 79). The 
8 patients with mutations in MMR genes had a median age of 50 (47 – 69). Table 3 
summarizes clinical information by each OC-associated gene. In the 54/570 (9.5%) UW 
patients with a previous history of breast cancer, 28/54 (51.8%) had mutations in OC 
associated genes, 17 (31.5%) in BRCA1, 9 (16.7%) in BRCA2, and 2 (3.7%) in other OC 
genes (1 BRIP1, 1 RAD51D).
Figure 1 summarizes mutation frequency by clinical characteristics. Disease site, race and 
ethnicity were not associated with mutation frequency. Patients with high-grade (grade 2–3) 
serous carcinomas had an overall mutation frequency of 19.4% and a combined BRCA1 and 
BRCA2 frequency of 16.0%. Patients with unspecified carcinomas, endometrioid, 
carcinosarcoma, and transitional cell histology had similar mutation rates to high-grade 
serous histology, both for all OC genes and for BRCA1 and BRCA2. Patients with clear cell 
histology had a lower overall mutation frequency (8.6% versus 19.4%, p=0.04, Fisher’s 
exact) relative to high-grade serous cases, but differences in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 
mutation frequency were of borderline significance (6.9% versus 16.0%, p=0.07). There 
were fewer mutations in patients with low-grade (grade 1) serous histology compared to 
high-grade serous (5.7% versus 19.4%, p=0.003 for any mutation; 5.7% versus 16.0% for 
BRCA1 and BRCA2, p=0.02). In 16 women with mucinous histology, no OC-associated 
mutations were found.
Survival
In the GOG patients, hazard ratios (HR) for progression and death were adjusted for 
protocol, study treatment, stage, residual disease, and initial performance status. The GOG 
patients were followed for 5 years. Both PFS and OS were longer for BRCA2 mutation 
carriers (median 21.9 months and not yet reached) than for those with no mutations (median 
14.2 and 44 months), with HR 0.60 (95% CI 0.45 – 0.79, p<0.001) for PFS, and HR 0.39 
(95% CI 0.25 – 0.60, p<0.001) for OS (Figure 2A and 2B). OS in BRCA1 mutation carriers

 (median 56 months) was intermediate between BRCA2 mutation carriers and women 
without mutations. Relative to those without mutations, the HR for BRCA1 mutations 
carriers was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.56–1.00, p=0.05, [Figure 2B]). In the UW group, OS for 
women with stage III and IV disease was longer in both BRCA2 mutation carriers (median 
70 months, p=0.004, Log-rank) and BRCA1 mutation carriers (median 46 months, p=0.04, 
Log-rank), when compared to women with no mutations (median 36 months). Exploratory 
analyses of the individuals from the GOG studies suggest that compared to those without 
mutations the PFS event rates for those individuals with BRCA1 mutations (p=0.009) or 
BRCA2 (p<0.001) mutations are time-dependent (Figure 2A). Specifically, the PFS event 
rate is initially lower for those with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations but this advantage 
declines overtime. There is a similar time-dependent decline in the relative death rate 
apparent for those with BRCA1 mutations compared to those without mutations (p<0.001, 
Figure 2B). In both GOG and UW patients (Figure 1 and data not shown), survival was 
similar for women with mutations in BRCA1 and other OC genes in the BRCA-Fanconi 
anemia pathway, but the analysis was limited due to low non-BRCA mutation frequency.
DISCUSSION
BRCA1 and BRCA2 are part of the BRCA-Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway, which 
controls DNA repair via homologous recombination.23–25 It is plausible that damaging 
mutations in other genes in this pathway would also confer a risk of OC. Indeed, our data 
demonstrate that mutations in the BRCA-Fanconi anemia OC genes BRIP1, RAD51C, and 
RAD51D together account for an additional 2.5% of unselected OC. Previous studies of 
high risk families or specific founder mutations have suggested that damaging mutations in 
BRIP1, RAD51C, and RAD51D confer a relative risk for OC of 6–8 fold and an absolute 
lifetime risk of 10–15%.8–11,26,27 Our data from unselected OC patients confirm BRIP1, 
RAD51C, and RAD51D as important OC genes. The Fanconi anemia gene BRIP1 (FANCJ), 
mutated in 1.4% of women with OC, is the next most commonly mutated gene in OC after 
BRCA1 and BRCA2.
In addition to identifying mutations in genes already implicated in OC, we identified 
mutations in the BRCA-Fanconi anemia genes PALB2 and BARD1 more frequently in 
women with OC compared to population frequencies in the ESP and ExAC (Table 2). 
PALB2 (FANCN) is a Fanconi anemia gene whose protein binds BRCA1 and BRCA2 at 
sites of DNA damage.28 Mutations in PALB2 are associated with an elevated risk of breast 
cancer and have been identified in families with both breast and OC29–31, but have not been 
clearly associated with OC risk.28,29 An analysis of germline mutations in high grade serous 
OC from the Cancer Genome Atlas project (TCGA) identified PALB2 as the only gene other 
than BRCA1 and BRCA2 to be significantly more frequently mutated compared to a subset 
of ESP controls from the Women’s Health Initiative. The PALB2 mutation frequency in our 
larger series was highly significant compared to population rates and was associated with 
similar odds ratios for OC as were RAD51C, RAD51D, and BRIP1 (Table 2). The corrected 
frequency of PALB2 mutations in the ESP is consistent with PALB2 mutation rates from 
other previously published control sets in which full sequencing of PALB2 was 
performed30,32, supporting the use of the ESP as a comparison population.

 Three recent publications by the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC) have 
examined rates of mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, mismatch repair genes, RAD51C, 
RAD51D, BRIP1, PALB2, and BARD1 compared to controls.12–14 The sequencing 
methodology reported by OCAC is different from our study. As the authors acknowledged, 
their sequencing methods resulted in relatively low coverage, were unable to detect genomic 
rearrangements, and likely lead to underestimation of mutation frequencies12. The impact of 
less sensitive sequencing methods is demonstrated by OCAC’s low BRCA1 mutation rate of 
3.8%14, which is significantly lower than our BRCA1 mutation rate of 9.5% (84/2222 versus 
182/1915, p<0.001, Fisher’s exact), and lower than that reported in other population-based 
series2,3. Even if we exclude genomic rearrangements, which OCAC could not detect, our 
BRCA1 mutation rate remains significantly higher (166/1915, 8.7%, versus 84/2222, 
p<0.001, Fisher’s exact). Despite a mutation rate for RAD51C and RAD51D that was 
approximately 30% lower than ours, OCAC identified a similar odds ratio to our calculation 
for these genes. OCAC did not find a difference in mutation frequency for PALB2 or 
BARD1 in OC cases versus controls13, but their lower mutation rates in cases and an 
unexpectedly high PALB2 mutation rate in controls impacted their power to detect such a 
difference.
BARD1 forms a heterodimer with BRCA1 mediated by their homologous ring finger 
motifs.33 This heterodimerization is critical to several tumor suppressor functions of 
BRCA1, and mutations in BRCA1 that affect binding to BARD1 are associated with 
increased cancer risk.34BARD1 mutations were rare in OC patients, but significantly more 
common than in the general population, leading to wide confidence intervals for the 
generated odds ratio for OC (Table 2). However, the significant p-value and the shared 
homology to BRCA1 support BARD1 as a rare OC susceptibility gene. These results are 
interpreted with some caution as two of the BARD1 mutation carriers also had mutations in 
BRCA1 (eTable1). Mutations in BARD1 have also been identified in women with triple 
negative breast cancer, another phenotype associated with BRCA1 mutations.35 Additional 
studies are needed to define the absolute risk of BARD1 for both breast and OC. The 
addition of BARD1 and PALB2 to other known OC genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51C, 
RAD51D, BRIP1, PALB2, MSH2, MLH1, MSH6, and PMS2) brings the total suspected 
hereditary OC genes to 11.
In contrast to PALB2 and BARD1, mutations in other genes in the BRCA-Fanconi anemia 
pathway previously implicated in breast but not OC risk (CHEK2, NBN, RAD50, 
FAM175A, and MRE11A) were not more commonly mutated in OC patients. Mutations in 
TP53 (which cause early onset breast cancer and Li Fraumeni syndrome) and ATM were 
slightly more frequent in OC than in population controls, which appeared significant when 
compared to the larger ExAC database. Given that mutations in all of these genes are rare, 
confidence intervals are wide, and we cannot fully exclude that some of these genes, and in 
particular ATM and TP53, are associated with some risk for OC. However, a relatively high 
risk of OC is unlikely.
Mutations in mismatch repair (MMR) genes (MSH2, MLH1, MSH6, and PMS2), which 
cause Lynch syndrome are often cited as the other major cause of hereditary OC in addition 
to BRCA1 and BRCA2.36 However, MMR mutations were infrequent (0.4%) in this series.

 Interestingly, 88% of MMR mutations in women with OC occurred in PMS2 or MSH6, in 
contrast to patients with colon cancer, in which MSH2 and MLH1 mutations predominate.37 
Notably, two of three OCs with MSH6 mutations were endometrioid and low stage, but all 
four PMS2-mutated cases were advanced stage, high-grade serous carcinomas. Our data are 
consistent with a population-based study of 1,638 women with invasive OC who were 
sequenced for mutations in MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6, where 0.5% had mutations, 5/9 in 
MSH6 (PMS2 not assessed).38
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends genetic testing for all 
women affected by OC, but some authors have proposed limiting BRCA1 and BRCA2 
testing to high-grade serous OC and suggested that BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations found in 
non-serous cases represent pathological misclassification.39 In our study, all cases were 
centrally reviewed by a panel of gynecologic pathologists, minimizing pathological 
misclassification. The overall mutation rate for high-grade serous histology was not 
significantly different from the mutation frequency in undifferentiated carcinoma, 
endometrioid, or carcinosarcoma histologies. While clear cell and low-grade serous OC did 
have fewer mutations compared to high-grade serous OC, the mutation rates (8.5% and 
5.7%, respectively) are probably still high enough to warrant genetic testing. Therefore, our 
data do not support the restriction of genetic testing to women with high-grade serous OC. 
Race and ethnicity also did not predict mutation status and should not be used to guide 
testing. Consistent with previous studies, OC survival was correlated with mutation status, 
with BRCA2 mutation carriers having the longest progression-free and overall survival.2,40 
This study is unique in that cancer treatments were standardized within the confines of 
clinical trials, reducing potential bias in how mutation status affected survival. Mutation 
status should be considered when analyzing outcomes of OC clinical trials.
There are currently no published guidelines for managing unaffected women found to have 
mutations in BRIP1, PALB2, RAD51C, RAD51D, and BARD1. We found similar odds 
ratios for OC conferred by damaging mutations in these genes to the previously identified 6–
8 fold relative risk in BRIP1, RAD51C, and RAD51D8–11,26,27 and a similar age distribution 
of OC diagnosis for women with mutations in these genes compared to BRCA2 (Table 2 and 
Table 3). If a lifetime risk of 10–15% is confirmed for these genes, it would be reasonable to 
consider risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy by age 45.
There are several limitations to this study. This was not a population-based study and the 
GOG cases were limited to stage III and IV cancers. However, all patients were enrolled at 
the time of diagnosis, which reduces survival bias, and they were unselected for age or 
family history. The ESP is thought to reflect US population mutation rates as opposed to 
cancer-free controls, as cancer status is not fully characterized. ExAC has the advantage of 
sequencing data on a large number of people, characterized by racial and ethnic group, but 
also contains people with known malignancies such as those in the Cancer Genome Atlas 
(TCGA) studies. The inclusion of known cancer patients in ExAC could falsely lower our 
calculated OR for OC. Ideally we would use a larger, well-characterized control group with 
age and race matching, with known cancer status. However, it is reassuring that mutation 
frequencies in the ESP for these genes were similar to previously published

 controls.8,9,30,32,41 Further research is needed to clarify the roles of inherited mutations in 
PALB2 and BARD1 in ovarian cancer risk.
In summary, we present data from a large, comprehensively sequenced group of unselected 
OC patients and provide data to implicate two new suspected hereditary OC genes, BARD1 
and PALB2. Overall, 347/1915 (18.1%) OC patients had 352 germline mutations in 11 OC 
genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, RAD51C, RAD51D, PALB2, BARD1, PMS2, MSH6, 
MLH1, and MSH2). Mutations were identified in all histologies of ovarian carcinoma, with 
the exception of mucinous carcinoma, and 72/352 (20.5%) OC-associated mutations 
occurred in a gene other than BRCA1 or BRCA2.
