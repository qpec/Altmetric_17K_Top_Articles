IMPORTANCE As society is increasingly becoming more networked, researchers are beginning
to explore how social media can be used to study person-to-person communication about
health and health care use. Twitter is an online messaging platform used by more than 300
million people who have generated several billion Tweets, yet little work has focused on the
potential applications of these data for studying public attitudes and behaviors associated
with cardiovascular health.
OBJECTIVE To describe the volume and content of Tweets associated with cardiovascular
disease as well as the characteristics of Twitter users.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We used Twitter to access a random sample of
approximately 10 billion English-language Tweets originating from US counties from July 23,
2009, to February 5, 2015, associated with cardiovascular disease. We characterized each
Tweet relative to estimated user demographics. A random subset of 2500 Tweets was
hand-coded for content and modifiers.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The volume of Tweets about cardiovascular disease and the
content of these Tweets.
RESULTS Of 550 338 Tweets associated with cardiovascular disease, the terms diabetes
(n = 239 989) and myocardial infarction (n = 269 907) were used more frequently than heart
failure (n = 9414). Users who Tweeted about cardiovascular disease were more likely to be
older than the general population of Twitter users (mean age, 28.7 vs 25.4 years; P < .01) and
less likely to be male (59 082 of 124 896 [47.3%] vs 8433 of 17 270 [48.8%]; P < .01). Most
Tweets (2338 of 2500 [93.5%]) were associated with a health topic; common themes of
Tweets included risk factors (1048 of 2500 [41.9%]), awareness (585 of 2500 [23.4%]), and
management (541 of 2500 [21.6%]) of cardiovascular disease.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Twitter offers promise for studying public communication
about cardiovascular disease.

P
erson-to-person communication is one of the most
persuasive ways people deliver and receive infor-
mation.1,2 Until recently, this communication was
impossible to collect and study. Now, social media net-
works allow researchers to systematically witness public
communication about health, including cardiovascular
disease. Twitter, one such network, is used by more than
300 million people who have generated several billion
Tweets.3,4
There are several unknowns when using social media
for research on cardiovascular disease. Is it possible to sepa-
rate signal from noise? Can the data be analyzed to charac-
terize features associated with the person posting and the
Tweet itself? Does the Twitter data set reflect real-time
changes in conversation? We explored these questions by
characterizing a sample of Tweets about cardiovascular dis-
ease from the United States.
Methods
This was an exploratory mixed-methods study of Twitter data
associated with cardiovascular disease.5 This study was
approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional
Review Board.
Data Source
Twitter is a social media platform that allows users to send and
receive 140-character messages known as Tweets. Our data
from July 23, 2009, through February 5, 2015, was made up
of the “Twitter decahose,” a 10% sample of Tweets (covering
52 months of posts), and the “Twitter spritzer,” a 1% sample
of Tweets (covering the other 15 months).
From this group of Tweets, we searched for keywords
associated with the following 5 cardiovascular diseases:
hypertension, diabetes, myocardial infarction, heart failure,
and cardiac arrest. To generate a set of search terms, we
used the Consumer Health Vocabulary,6 the Unified Medical
Language System,7 and the consensus of the study authors.
The following keywords were identified from these sources:
diabetes (blood glucose and mellitus), heart attack (coronary
attack, cardiac infarction, myocardial infarction, heart
infarction, myocardial infarct, and myocardial necrosis), car-
diac arrest (asystolic, asystole, cardiac arrest, heart arrest,
ventricular fibrillation, and pulseless electrical activity),
heart failure (cardiac failure), and hypertension (high blood
pressure). To ensure that Tweets with these keywords were
in English, we applied an English-language classifier to the
sample.
Tweet Location
Reported coordinates were used to identify Tweets that
could be mapped to a county in the United States.8 For
Tweets without coordinates but with location information,
locations reflecting city or county plus state were mapped.
Tweets that could not be mapped to a US county by this pro-
cess were eliminated.
Twitter Users
To characterize Twitter users, we collected information from
each user’
s account, including the number of friends and fol-
lowers. Additional data about Twitter users can be estimated
based on their behavior on the platform. By applying estab-
lished language-based algorithms based on users with known
demographics to the Tweets in our sample, we imputed the
age and sex of each user9; these data were compared with a
random sample of Twitter users.
Tweet Content
To describe the content of Tweets, 2 of us (C.L.D. and C.M.)
used NVivo (QSR International) to code 500 Tweets for each
of the 5 cardiovascular diseases, adjudicating differences with
a larger group of authors (F.B., D.B., and R.M.M.). After cod-
ing the set of 2500 Tweets, total agreement for each category
was greater than 90% and the mean κ was 0.77.
Tweet Rate
We measured the number of Tweets per topic per day. To ac-
count for variability in the baseline Tweet count, we identi-
fied 3 peaks in Twitter posts for each US-based disease topic
against 7-day running means. Two of us (L.E.S. and C.T.) then
identified the triggers for the peaks by identifying the com-
mon theme in the Tweets for that day.
Statistical Analysis
We used χ2 test to compare the sex of individuals Tweeting
about cardiovascular disease with the sex of the general popu-
lation of Twitter users. Paired t tests were used to compare the
agesofindividualsTweetingaboutcardiovasculardiseasewith
those of the general population of Twitter users.
Results
Tweet Volume and Rate
From an initial sample of 10 billion Tweets, we identified 4.9
million with terms associated with cardiovascular disease;
550 338 were in English and originated from a US county (eFig-
ure 1 in the Supplement). Diabetes and myocardial infarction
represented more than 200 000 Tweets each, while the topic
of heart failure returned fewer than 10 000 Tweets (Table 1).

Key Points
Question Can Twitter, a social media platform for
person-to-person communication, be used as a data source to
study cardiovascular disease?
Findings In this descriptive study, we identified 4.9 million Tweets
about cardiovascular disease posted on Twitter. User
demographics, as well as content (eg, risk factors, awareness, and
treatment) and volume of Tweets, varied across cardiovascular
diseases.
Meaning Twitter has potential as a data source for studying public
communication about cardiovascular health.

of Tweets geocoded to the United States (eTable in the Supple-
ment). Peaks in Tweet rate were associated most often with
thematically connected events reported in the news (eFigure
2 in the Supplement).
Twitter Users
Thosetweetingaboutcardiovasculardiseasetendedtobeolder
than the general population of Twitter users (mean age, 28.7
vs 25.4 years; P < .01); mean age and sex varied across the dif-
ferentcardiovascularconditions(Table1).Userstweetingabout
cardiovascular disease were less likely to be male compared
with the general population of Twitter users (59 082 of 124 896
[47.3%] vs 8433 of 17 270 [48.8%]; P < .01).
Tweet Content
Tweet content varied across and within cardiovascular dis-
ease terms (Table 2). Most of the hand-coded Tweets in our
sample (2338 of 2500 [93.5%]) included health-related infor-
mation. The most commonly represented theme was risk fac-
torsforcardiovasculardisease(1048of2500[41.9%])(Table2).
Approximately one-fourth of all Tweets (585 of 2500 [23.4%])
discussed awareness, frequently in the setting of fundraising
for disease. Many Tweets (541 of 2500 [21.6%]) discussed the
treatment and management of cardiovascular disease, often
focusing on topics such as diet and exercise. Of Tweets that
discussed outcomes of cardiovascular disease (247 of 2500
[9.9%]), most (193 [78.1%]) mentioned death.
Tweet Modifiers
Tweets could be characterized by tone, style, and perspec-
tive. Tweets associated with cardiovascular disease often used
metaphor (1106 of 2500 [44.2%]), emotional language with
positive or negative sentiment (974 of 2500 [39%]), and first-
person accounts (872 of 2500 [34.9%]) (Table 3). Three per-
cent of Tweets included a statement that the individual post-
ing the Tweet identified as having cardiovascular disease.
Discussion
This study has 3 main findings. First, we identified a large vol-
umeofUS-basedTweetsaboutcardiovasculardisease.Second,
we were able to characterize the volume, content, style, and
senderoftheseTweets,demonstratingtheabilitytoidentifysig-
nal from noise. Third, we found that the data available on Twit-
ter reflect real-time changes in discussion of a disease topic.
Wewereabletoidentify4.9millionTweetsassociatedwith
cardiovascular disease. Of the hand-coded sample, 94% in-
cluded some form of information associated with health rather
than a colloquial but non–health-associated use of the term.
Prior work has suggested, however, that the language of
Tweets, regardless of whether they arise from patients or other
membersofthecommunity,canprovideinsightintothehealth
behaviors of communities that are known to influence risk of
disease.10 We also observed that Twitter users respond to
events, such as World Diabetes Day or celebrity deaths, within
minutes to hours and that these peaks in discussion are eas-
ily identifiable in the Twitter data set.
This study has several limitations. Our study focused on
Tweetsrelevantto5specificcardiovascularconditions.Broader
terms such as heart disease, specific terms such as sudden car-
diac death, and slang terms such as DM2 or diabeetus may have
captured other themes associated with these diagnoses. This
study characterized only US-based English-language Tweets.
We did not characterize the impression for each Tweet or the
identities of those who received each Tweet. Hand coding was
performed to read the text of Tweets and infer content, pur-
pose,andsentiment.Thetruenatureorintentoftheusercould
not be verified.
Conclusions
Twitter may be useful for studying public communication
about cardiovascular disease. The use of Twitter for clinical re-
search is still in its infancy. Its value and direct applications
remain to be seen and warrant further exploration.

Editor's Note
Twitter and Cardiovascular Disease
Useful Chirps or Noisy Chatter?
Mintu P. Turakhia, MD, MAS; Robert A. Harrington, MD
As modern society continues to organize around a digital, con-
nected way of life, information from our daily interactions and
exposures are now measured, recorded, and memorialized in
ways previously unimagi-
nable. This tapestry of infor-
mationincludesdatafromso-
cial media or electronic tools,
such as websites and applications, that enable users to cre-
ate, share, and exchange content.1 Twitter is one such social
networking service whose 310 million active users post short
public messages known as Tweets.
In this issue of JAMA Cardiology, Sinnenberg and
colleagues2 explore the characteristics of Twitter users and
Tweets associated with cardiovascular disease. They found a
large volume of Tweets (4.9 million) on cardiovascular dis-
ease and were able to characterize tone, style, and perspec-
tive of these Tweets, as well as some basic demographics of
the users posting them. Most notably, Sinnenberg and col-
leagues found that Tweet volume and content were tempo-
rally associated with news events that were thematically con-
nected with cardiovascular disease.
This brief report differs from much of the original inves-
