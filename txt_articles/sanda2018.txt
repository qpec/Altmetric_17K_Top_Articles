Abstract
Introduction. The beneficial effects of physical activity during pregnancy for the
mother and offspring have been reported by several studies but there are
conflicting results concerning the possible effect of physical activity on the
course of labor and risk of cesarean delivery. This study presents secondary
analyses from the Norwegian Fit for Delivery randomized controlled trial,
aiming at studying the effect of a lifestyle intervention including group exercise
classes, as well as the possible influence of physical activity level in late
pregnancy, on labor outcomes. Material and methods. Healthy nulliparous
women with singleton pregnancy were randomized to an intervention group,
n = 303 (dietary counseling and twice-weekly exercise classes) or a control
group, n = 303 (standard care). The participants were analyzed both by
randomization and as a cohort comparing women with lowest (quartile 1, 0
metabolic equivalent of task-hours moderate-to-vigorous physical activity/
week) (n = 140) vs. highest (quartile 4, ≥16 metabolic equivalent of task-hours
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity/week) (n = 131) physical activity level
in
late
pregnancy,
assessed
with
the
International
Physical
Activity
Questionnaire. Result. The intervention group had a longer first stage of labor
compared
with
the
control
group
(293 � 202 min
vs.
257 � 181 min,
p = 0.030). No differences between the randomization groups were seen for
time spent in second stage of labor, prolonged labor or mode of delivery. In
the total sample, women with the highest physical activity level had lower odds
ratio (OR) of acute cesarean delivery (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.11–0.97, p = 0.044)
than
did
those
with
the
lowest
physical
activity-level.
Conclusion. A
significantly longer first stage of labor was observed in the intervention group
than in the control group. A high physical activity level in late pregnancy was
associated with lower odds of acute cesarean delivery compared with a low
physical activity level.

 Introduction
Physical activity level tends to decline as the pregnancy
progresses (1,2). Beneficial effects of physical activity
during pregnancy for both the mother and her baby
have been reported in several studies (3,4). Women with
uncomplicated pregnancies are recommended to exercise
at moderate intensity for a minimum of 150 min/week,
with few restrictions, as this level of physical activity is
considered not to harm the mother or the fetus (3).
However, conflicting results concerning possible associa-
tions between physical activity level and duration of
labor have previously been reported by exercise-interven-
tion studies (4–6), observational studies of recreational
exercisers (7), and observational studies of the general
population (2,8). Exercise during pregnancy may also
play a role in mode of delivery, but the literature is
inconsistent and presents no consensus as to whether
physical activity influences the rate of cesarean delivery
(2,9–12). However, a recently published meta-analysis
with individual participant data from 36 randomized
controlled trials, including the Norwegian Fit for Deliv-
ery (NFFD) trial, demonstrated that physical activity
and diet interventions during pregnancy lower the odds
of cesarean delivery (13).
The NFFD trial was designed to evaluate whether an
antenatal lifestyle intervention combining physical activity
and dietary elements resulted in measurable health bene-
fits for both mother and her baby (14). The trial demon-
strated a significantly higher physical activity level in late
pregnancy among the intervention group participants
than the control group participants (15). No difference
between groups of randomization was found for operative
delivery or postpartum hemorrhage ≥500 mL, birthweight
or length of gestation (16).
In this secondary analysis, we aimed to investigate the
effect of the NFFD intervention on the course of labor
(induction of labor, use of analgesia, duration of labor),
mode of delivery (vaginal vs. cesarean), postpartum hem-
orrhage >1000 mL, placental weight, and birth outcomes
[Apgar score, admission into neonatal intensive care unit
(NICU) >48 h]. In addition, we also aimed to analyze the
participants as a cohort and compare the same outcomes
in participants with the lowest vs. the highest physical
activity level in late pregnancy.
Material and methods
The NFFD trial was a population-based antenatal com-
bined lifestyle intervention consisting of dietary counsel-
ing
and
supervised
exercise
classes,
evaluated
in
a
randomized controlled trial. Normal weight, overweight
and obese participants were recruited by midwifes from
eight healthcare clinics in the southern part of Norway,
encompassing
both
cities
and
rural
areas,
between
September 2009 and February 2013. Eligible participants
were healthy nulliparous women, ≥18 years old, literate
in
Norwegian
or
English,
with
singleton
pregnancy
≤20 weeks of gestation and a pre-pregnancy body mass
index ≥19 kg/m2.
Exclusion criteria were preexisting diabetes, disabilities
precluding participation in an exercise program, contin-
ued substance abuse or planned relocation outside of the
study area before delivery. All participants planned to give
birth at Sørlandet Hospital HF, which is a conglomera-
tion of three hospitals located in the cities Kristiansand,
Arendal
and
Flekkefjord.
Most
women
delivered
at
Sørlandet Hospital HF Kristiansand, which is the regional
maternity unit in southern Norway, delivering approxi-
mately 2000 babies a year. Approximately 1610 nulli-
parous
women
attended
the
participating
healthcare
clinics during the inclusion period and were thus poten-
tially eligible for inclusion. After providing informed con-
sent
and
completing
initial
blood
tests
and
questionnaires, 606 women (37.6%) were included in the
study. Of these, 589 were included in the analysis, divided
into the intervention group (n = 295) and the control
group (n = 294). A Consort flow chart of the study pop-
ulation is presented in Figure 1. The study protocol has
been published previously (14). The primary outcomes of
the NFFD trial were gestational weight gain, weight reten-
tion postpartum, maternal hyperglycemia and the inci-
dence of large-for-gestational-age newborns (15–17); of
these, an intervention effect was only demonstrated for
gestational weight gain (reduced by 1.3 kg, from pre-
pregnancy weight to term) (16).
Intervention
From time of randomization (mean gestational week
17.6 � 2.6)
until
delivery
(mean
gestational
week
39.9 � 1.8), the intervention group had access to a twice-
weekly standardized exercise program. Classes were pro-
vided for groups at five different fitness centers, led by
qualified instructors and consisted of 10 min of warm-up,
40 min of cardiovascular and strength exercises at moder-
ate intensity, with emphasis on core and pelvic floor

 musculature, and finally 10 min of stretching. Exercise
intensity was measured by ratings of perceived exertion set
to 12–14 (somewhat hard) on the 6–20 Borg rating scale
(18). Additionally, the participants were encouraged to
undertake at least 30 min of cardio exercises at moderate
intensity at least three times a week, in accordance with
current
physical
activity
recommendations
(19).
The
instructors recorded adherence to exercise classes but no
log was kept of self-imposed daily activity. The dietary
component of the intervention consisted of 10 dietary
recommendations designed by the NFFD team (14).
Women in the control group received standard prenatal
care provided through alternating visits with midwives and
doctors.

Exercise in pregnancy and labor outcomes
 Physical activity assessment
The self-reported International Physical Activity Ques-
tionnaire Short-Form (IPAQ-SF) (20) was used to assess
physical activity level. IPAQ-SF quantifies frequency and
duration of vigorous intensity physical activity (VPA),
moderate intensity physical activity (MPA), walking and
sitting during the last seven days. Participants in both the
intervention and the control group answered IPAQ-SF
either electronically (>90%, in Norwegian) or in print (in
English or Norwegian), at inclusion (mean gestational
week 16.1 � 2.5) and at gestational week 36. Responses
were scored according to established methods (www.ipa
q.ki.se). For MPA and VPA, the reported frequency
(days/week) was multiplied by reported average duration
(min/day) and by the corresponding IPAQ algorithm (4.0
for MPA and 8.0 for VPA) to calculate the corresponding
metabolic equivalent of task (MET) in h/week. In the
IPAQ-SF, no report of intensity is given with respect to
walking (www.ipaq.ki.se). Hence, we decided not to
include walking as a part of MPA and VPA levels in this
study. One MET is equivalent to the energy expenditure
at rest (1 MET = 3.5 mL O2/kg/min). The intensity cate-
gory moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was
calculated by adding MPA and VPA.
Measurements
Labor and delivery data were recorded in partographs by
midwifes assisting during birth who were blinded to ran-
domization. A research assistant not involved in the study
and blinded to randomization, recorded labor outcomes
after delivery from electronic hospital records. The active
first stage of labor was defined as the time from regular
contractions and cervix effaced and dilated 4 cm to com-
plete dilation (10 cm) (21). The second stage of labor
was defined as time from fully dilated cervix to delivery,
and the active second stage was defined as the time of
active pushing (21). Active labor was defined as active
first and second stage of labor together (21). Prolonged
labor was used to describe “abnormal labor” and was
defined as active labor exceeding 12 h (21). Prolonged
active second stage was defined as active pushing over
60 min (22). Cesarean delivery was defined as acute or
pre-labor. Instrumental vaginal deliveries included both
vacuum and forceps deliveries. Vaginal delivery was
defined as spontaneous vaginal and instrumental vaginal
deliveries together. Episiotomies were performed by lat-
eral technique (23). Perineal tears affecting the external
and internal sphincter are referred to as obstetric anal
sphincter injuries. The attending midwife or obstetrician
estimated
blood
loss,
and
postpartum
hemorrhage
≥1000 mL was registered. Pre-pregnancy body mass index
was calculated from self-reported pre-pregnancy weight
and height. Gestational length at birth was calculated
based
on
mid-trimester
ultrasound
scan
(eSnurra).
Sociodemographic data were obtained from a question-
naire answered at inclusion, and citizenship was obtained
from hospital records.
Statistical analyses
Analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle. When
analyzing the sample as a cohort, participants reporting
the lowest and the highest MVPA level at gestational
week 36 were included; giving the low active group,
n = 140 (quartile 1, with 0 MET-hours of MVPA/week)
vs. the high active group, n = 131 (quartile 4, with ≥16
MET-hours of MVPA/week).
Descriptive statistics are presented as mean with stan-
dard deviation, median with interquartile range or pro-
portions
with
n
(%),
as
appropriate.
For
group
comparisons, categorical variables were analyzed using
Pearson’s Chi-squared test, and continuous variables were
analyzed using the independent sample t-test or the
Mann–Whitney U-test. For comparisons of proportions
between
groups,
MEDCALC
for
Windows,
version
12.7.7.0 (MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium) was used.
Multivariable analyses were performed for duration of
labor and delivery outcomes, for both randomization
analyses and cohort analyses. Analyses in the final model
included all variables with a p-value <0.20 in the bivariate
analyses. The Hosmer step-down procedure (24) was per-
formed and repeated until all factors were significant at a
level p < 0.05. Linear regression analyses were performed
investigating duration of labor given as b with 95% confi-
dence interval (CI). Logistic regression analyses were per-
formed for delivery outcomes reporting odds ratio (OR),
adjusted OR and 95% CI. Randomization or physical
activity category (depending on which analyses were per-
formed) and age were always retained in the regression
analyses. For both linear regression and logistic regression
analyses,
the

 (REK reference 2009/429) and the trial was registered at
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01001689).
Results
Baseline characteristics were similar when comparing both
groups based on randomization and groups based on
physical activity level, except for a higher proportion of
overweight/obese women in the low active group (35.0%)
than
in
the
high active
group (22.9%)
(p = 0.029)
(Table 1).
Analyses based on randomization groups
At gestational week 36, the intervention group reported a
median of 8 (2–19) MET-hours of MVPA/week, whereas
the control group reported a median of 4 (0–12) MET-
hours of MVPA/week (p < 0.001).
First stage of labor was longer in the intervention
group
(293 � 202 min)
than
in
the
control
group
(257 � 181 min) (p = 0.030), resulting in longer mean
duration of active labor in total (323 � 167 min vs.
278 � 164 min, respectively (p = 0.027) (Table 2). Time
spent in second stage or active second stage of labor did
not differ between the intervention and the control
group, nor did prolonged labor (>12 h) or prolonged
active second stage of labor (>60 min) (Table 2). Differ-
ences in duration of labor remained unchanged when
women with cesarean delivery were excluded from the
analyses. The strongest contributors to duration of labor
were use of epidural (b = 0.29, 95% CI 93.76–166.72,
p < 0.001), birthweight (b = 0.15, 95% CI 0.26–0.09,
p < 0.001) and induction of labor (b = 0.17, 95% CI
41.07–116.21, p < 0.001), explaining 14% of the variation.
There were no significant differences in other obstetrical
or birth outcomes between the intervention group and
the control group (Tables 2 and 3).
Analyses based on physical activity level groups
Among the high active group participants, median MVPA
level was 22 MET-hours/week at gestational week 36

Exercise in pregnancy and labor outcomes
B. Sanda et al.
 (min–max values: 16–88 MET-hours/week), and of these,
71.8% reported VPA (min–max values: 1.3–40 MET-
hours/week).
In the low active group, 65.0% of the participants orig-
inally belonged to the control group and 35.0% to the
intervention group, whereas the corresponding numbers
for the high active group were 33.6% belonging to the
control group and 66.4% to the intervention group.
There were no differences in duration of labor between
low vs. high active group (p = 0.076) in the unadjusted
analyses (Table 2). In the adjusted analyses, total duration
of labor was 58 min longer in the high active group than
in the low active group (b = 0.16, 95% CI 13.62–103.31,
p = 0.011). The strongest contributors to duration of
labor were use of epidural (b = 0.32, 95% CI 88.84–
194.84, p < 0.001), birthweight (b = 0.16, 95% CI 0.15–
0.102, p = 0.008) and induction of labor (b = 0.16, 95%
CI 19.37–128.33, p = 0.008), explaining 14% of the varia-
tion. When the stages of labor were examined individu-
ally (first stage, second stage, active second stage) there
were no significant differences in duration between low
and high active groups in the adjusted analyses. The low
active group was more likely to use epidural analgesia
during labor than was the high active group (OR 1.88,
95% CI 1.04–3.41, p = 0.036). In adjusted analyses, being
in the high active group was associated with higher odds
of a vaginal delivery (OR 2.69, 95% CI 1.02–7.09,
p = 0.046), as well as lower odds of an acute cesarean
delivery (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.11–0.97, p = 0.044) com-
pared with women in the low active group (Table 4,

Exercise in pregnancy and labor outcomes
 Figure 2). Failure to progress in labor was the most com-
mon reported indication for acute cesarean delivery,
accounting for 70.6% of the cases in the low active group
and 50.0% in the high active group (p = 0.001). Total
cesarean delivery rate was 15.0% in the low active group
and 6.9% in the high active group (p = 0.033). Pre-labor
cesarean delivery was similar between the low and the
high active groups; 2.9% vs. 2.3%, respectively (p = 0.77).
Other obstetrical and birth outcomes were, overall, simi-
lar between women in the low and the high active group
(Tables 2 and 4).
Discussion
The main findings of the present study were that the
intervention group participants experienced a longer first
stage of labor. No group differences were observed with
regard to second stage of labor, prolonged labor, or birth
outcomes. Analysing the total group as a cohort, women
with high MVPA level in late pregnancy had lower odds
for acute cesarean delivery compared to women with low
MVPA levels. Epidural analgesia was more common
among women in the low active group compared to
women in the high active group.
Nulliparous women are at greater risk of experiencing
both
longer
labor
and
eventually
prolonged
labor
compared to multiparous women (25). Furthermore, pro-
longed labor is in turn associated with higher risk of
operative vaginal and cesarean delivery (22), obstetric
anal sphincter injury (22) and postpartum hemorrhage
(22). In the present study, rates of prolonged labor were
similar between randomization groups, which is in line
with another exercise-intervention study from Norway
including 855 participants (5). However, the intervention
group, in the present study, experienced 44 min longer
total duration of labor than the control group, mainly
due to 36 min longer first stage of labor. Mean active
labor in nulliparous women has been reported to be six
hours (26). As both randomization groups in the present
study experienced a total duration of active labor of less
than six hours (5.4 and 4.6 h, respectively), the small dif-
ference found in duration is most likely of little clinical
importance. Our data provide no explanation for the dif-
ference in duration of labor observed between randomiza-
tion groups. However, adjusted analyses of the physical
activity cohort analyses showed a significantly longer total
duration of labor in the high active group than the low
active group, suggesting that physical activity level may
play a role. Studies involving supervised exercise interven-
tions reporting on duration of labor are few, with incon-
sistent results: a shorter first stage of labor of 2.1 h (4); a
longer active second stage of 6 and 19 min in the

 intervention groups (5,9) compared with their corre-
sponding control groups; and no difference at all in dura-
tion of labor between groups of randomization (6).
However, several of the trials reported findings for both
nulliparous and multiparous women, and the trials used
different definitions of duration of labor, or failed to pro-
vide a definition, making comparison of outcomes such
as duration of labor deceptive. Further, comparison of
studies is challenged by different exercise-intervention
designs, varying designs for the control groups, as well as
different trimesters for start-up of interventions (4–6,9).
In line with previous trials, we found no differences
between the randomization groups regarding number of
inductions (27) or use of an epidural (5), factors that
might influence duration of labor (28).
In the present study we found no difference in cesarean
delivery rate between groups of randomization. This find-
ing is supported by previous trials involving an exercise
program (5,29). However, two meta-analysis concluded
that structured aerobic and resistance exercise during
pregnancy (16 studies, n = 3037) (10) and exercise of
low-to-moderate intensity during the second and third
trimesters (five studies, no data as to numbers) (11)
decrease the risk of cesarean delivery among healthy preg-
nant women. The NFFD trial was not powered to assess
adequately mode of delivery, but a recently published
meta-analysis including 36 combined lifestyle interven-
tions (n = 12 526), including those in the NFFD trial
(13), reported lower odds of cesarean delivery in the
intervention group participants than in standard care
controls (OR = 0.91). Another possible explanation for
the lack of effect of the NFFD intervention on mode of
delivery might be that the exercise workload was inade-
quate, with only two exercise sessions per week and a
focus on strength- and low impact exercises, including
pelvic floor muscle training. In addition, the intervention
started late in the first half of pregnancy, perhaps too late
to influence obstetrical outcomes.
When analyzing the sample as a cohort based on physi-
cal activity level in late pregnancy, we found that women
in the high active group had lower odds of an acute
cesarean delivery compared with the low active group.
Given that vaginal delivery for the firstborn is of signifi-
cant importance not only on an individual level but also
for subsequent maternal and neonatal risks (30), these
findings might be of clinical importance. The high active
group in the cohort analyses reported a median physical
activity level of four or more hours of MVPA/week,
whereas the intervention group reported a median physi-
cal activity level of two hours of MVPA/week at gesta-
tional week 36. Correspondingly, the low active group
reported no MVPA/week and the control group reported
1 h of MVPA/week at gestational week 36. This difference
in MVPA-level might partly explain why an association
between physical activity level and acute cesarean delivery
rate was found in the cohort analyses but no effect on
mode of delivery was found when randomization groups
were compared. Comparable to our findings in the cohort
analyses, a recently published large Norwegian cohort
study (n = 30 364) showed that exercising frequently and
performing high-impact exercises at gestational week 30
were associated with a reduced risk of acute cesarean
delivery, compared with not exercising (12). Improved
maternal
cardiovascular
function,
greater
physical
strength and endurance to sustain the effort required dur-
ing childbirth might partly explain why highly active
women experience a lower acute cesarean delivery rate
than their less physically active counterparts (11) and
hence a longer total duration of labor as seen in the
adjusted analyses.
Walking is a common mode of exercise in pregnancy
(31,32). However, in the present study MVPA level is
reported
without
time
spent
walking,
as
IPAQ-SF
excludes walking from the moderate intensity category
and gives no information on the intensity of walking
(www.ipaq.ki.se). At gestational week 36, the intervention
group reported more time spent walking than the control
group (8 (3,15) vs. 7 (2,15) MET-hours/week, p = 0.04)
(33), as did the high active group compared with the low
active group (12 (4,23) vs. 5 (0.1,11) MET-hours/week,
p < 0.001) (data not shown). It is likely that participants
performed part of the time spent walking at moderate
intensity. Hence, the differences in MVPA level between
the groups might have been even larger if walking had
been included. This in turn might have resulted in stron-
ger effects or associations between physical activity level
and various outcomes than observed in our analysis.
Total duration of labor was significantly longer in the
high active group than the low active group in the
adjusted analyses. However, no difference in duration of
first and second stage of labor was found between the
two physical activity groups in the cohort analyses. This
is in contrast to an observational study comprising 40
nulliparous women, which reported that an increase in
aerobic fitness was associated with a decrease in total
duration of labor (8). However, the two studies may not
be directly comparable, as the other study investigated
physical fitness instead of physical activity level, and in
addition defined start of labor at 3 cm cervical dilation,
not 4 cm as we used in our study. A longer total duration
of labor in the high active group corresponds well with
our finding that the high active group (93%) was more
likely to deliver vaginally than the low active group
(85%), which in turn might reflect the greater physical
ability women in the high active group possessed to sus-
tain the course of labor, compared with women in the

 low active group. Although a significantly larger propor-
tion of women were overweight/obese in the low active
group (35%) than the high active group (23%) in our
study, it did not seem to influence duration of labor, in
contrast to findings in a Swedish observational study
(n = 63 829), where obesity was associated with a longer
first stage and a shorter second stage of labor (34).
The main strength of the study is the prospective
randomized controlled trial design. In addition, the
NFFD
trial
is
among
the
largest
trials
published
involving a supervised exercise program as part of a
combined
lifestyle
intervention.
Another
strength
is
recruitment of participants through antenatal visits at
their healthcare clinics, rather than a potentially more
selected population recruited through advertising. Fur-
ther, we used definitions of start and duration of
labor in accordance with the World Health Organiza-
tion recommendations (21). Finally, we explored possi-
ble differences in delivery outcome between women
with the highest physical activity level vs. the lowest
physical activity level in late pregnancy, which can
contribute to elucidation of possible positive and nega-
tive associations between physical activity level and
labor outcomes.
The first limitation of our study is that physical activity
level is self-reported. We have previously demonstrated
that physically active pregnant women tend to under-
report and physically inactive pregnant women to over-
report physical activity level (20). A second limitation is
that the NFFD trial was not powered for the outcomes
analyzed in the present study. Third, our study lacks data
on augmentation of labor, which may influence duration
of labor and cesarean delivery rate.
Conclusion
The NFFD lifestyle intervention, including twice-weekly
supervised exercise classes, demonstrated a slightly longer
first stage of labor in the intervention group than in the
control group. High physical activity level in late preg-
nancy was associated with lower odds of an acute cesar-
ean delivery, compared with a low physical activity level.
The results of the present study confirm that exercise in
late pregnancy does not seem to influence obstetrical out-
come negatively.
