Objective: Because curcumin’s anti-inflammatory properties may protect the brain
from neurodegeneration, we studied its effect on memory in non-demented adults and
explored its impact on brain amyloid and tau accumulation using 2-(1-{6-[(2-[F-
18]fluoroethyl)(methyl)amino]-2-naphthyl}ethylidene)malononitrile positron emission
tomography (FDDNP-PET). Methods: Forty subjects (age 51–84 years) were random-
ized to a bioavailable form of curcumin (Theracurmin® containing 90 mg of curcumin
twice daily [N = 21]) or placebo (N = 19) for 18 months.Primary outcomes were verbal
(Buschke Selective Reminding Test [SRT]) and visual (Brief Visual Memory Test-
Revised [BVMT-R]) memory, and attention (Trail Making A) was a secondary outcome.
FDDNP-PET signals (15 curcumin, 15 placebo) were determined in amygdala, hypo-
thalamus, medial and lateral temporal, posterior cingulate, parietal, frontal, and motor
(reference) regions. Mixed effects general linear models controlling for age and edu-
cation, and effect sizes (ES; Cohen’s d) were estimated. Results: SRT Consistent Long-
Term Retrieval improved with curcumin (ES = 0.63, p = 0.002) but not with placebo
(ES = 0.06, p = 0.8; between-group: ES = 0.68, p = 0.05). Curcumin also improved SRT
Total (ES = 0.53, p = 0.002), visual memory (BVMT-R Recall:ES = 0.50, p = 0.01;BVMT-R
Delay:ES = 0.51, p = 0.006), and attention (ES = 0.96, p < 0.0001) compared with placebo
(ES = 0.28, p = 0.1; between-group: ES = 0.67, p = 0.04). FDDNP binding decreased

 significantly in the amygdala with curcumin (ES = −0.41, p = 0.04) compared with
placebo (ES = 0.08, p = 0.6; between-group: ES = 0.48, p = 0.07). In the hypothalamus,
FDDNP binding did not change with curcumin (ES = −0.30, p = 0.2), but increased
with placebo (ES = 0.26, p = 0.05; between-group: ES = 0.55, p = 0.02). Conclusions:
Daily oral Theracurmin may lead to improved memory and attention in non-
demented adults.The FDDNP-PET findings suggest that symptom benefits are associated
with decreases in amyloid and tau accumulation in brain regions modulating mood
and memory. (Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 2018; 26:266–277)

Highlights
• This is the first long-term (18 months) double-blind, placebo controlled trial of a
bioavailable form of curcumin (Theracurmin® containing 90 mg of curcumin twice
daily) in non-demented adults.
• We found that daily oral Theracurmin led to significant memory and attention benefits.
• FDDNP-PET scans performed pre- and post-treatment suggested that behavioral and
cognitive benefits are associated with decreases in plaque and tangle accumulation
in brain regions modulating mood and memory.
• Curcumin’s cognitive benefits may stem from its anti-inflammatory and/or anti-
amyloid brain effects.
C
urcumin (1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-
1,6-heptadiene-2,5-dione) is the Indian herb used
in curry powder and is a polyphenolic compound
derived from turmeric, the dried rhizome of Curcuma
longa L. (Fam. Zingiberaceae).1 Turmeric gives curry
its yellow color and has been used as a food flavor-
ing, preservative, and an herbal remedy for arthritis,
cancer, and cardiac and other medical conditions.1
Curcumin’s anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-
amyloid, and possible anti-tau properties may offer
neuroprotective benefits.2,3 Epidemiological studies in-
dicate a lower prevalence of Alzheimer disease in
Indian people who consume curcumin in curry and
a link between dietary curry consumption and better
cognitive performance in older adults, supporting the
hypothesis that curcumin consumption may provide
neuroprotective benefits.4,5
Despite such promising research on curcumin’s po-
tential brain health benefits, initial placebo-controlled
trials in humans have yielded negative results,6,7 perhaps
because they used forms of curcumin with limited
bioavailability.8 Moreover, the neurodegeneration in pa-
tients who are already suffering from dementia may be
too extensive for the treatment to be effective. Previous
investigations indicate that the neuropathological and
clinical decline ofAlzheimer disease begins years before
patients develop dementia symptoms (i.e., cognitive
decline making them dependent on others).9Autopsy
studies have demonstrated that the neuropathological
hallmarks of Alzheimer disease, β-amyloid (in senile
plaques) and tau (in neurofibrillary tangles), accumu-
lategraduallyinapredictablespatialpatternduringaging
decades before people develop dementia symptoms.10,11
In recent years, investigators have begun testing more
bioavailable forms of curcumin in non-demented adults.
In a 12-month placebo-controlled trial, Rainey-Smith
et al.12 found no differences in all cognitive measures
between curcumin- and placebo-treatment groups,
except for a significant interaction between time and
treatment group for the Montreal Cognitive Assess-
ment test; this finding, however, resulted from a decline
in general cognitive function of the placebo group at
6 months that was not observed in the curcumin group.
A second trial demonstrated that another bioavailable
form of curcumin improved working memory and sus-
tained attention, compared with placebo, 1 hour after
curcumin administration. After 1 month of treat-
ment, working memory and mood improved in the
curcumin-treated subjects, but no effects were ob-
served for long-term memory.13 These results were
promising, but the brief trial duration limits conclu-
sions regarding long-term use.

 Although laboratory and animal studies indicate
curcumin’s potential effect on amyloid plaques and tau
tangles,2 previous human trials of curcumin have not
monitored in vivo effects of this polyphenol on brain
plaque and tangle accumulation. Our group devel-
oped 2-(1-{6-[(2-[F-18]fluoroethyl)(methyl)amino]-2-
naphthyl}ethylidene)malononitrile positron emission
tomography (FDDNP-PET), which provides in vivo
images of brain plaques and tangles.14 We have shown
that FDDNP binding values in selected brain areas are
significantly higher in Alzheimer dementia than in
healthy aging and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).15
In non-demented individuals, lower cognitive perfor-
mance is associated with higher FDDNP binding in
brain regions that control thinking and memory.16
To address some of the limitations of previous
human studies, we performed a randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled, 18-month trial in middle-
aged and older non-demented adults to determine the
effects of daily oral use of a highly absorptive curcumin
dispersed with colloidal nanoparticles (Theracurmin,
Theravalues Corp., Tokyo, Japan)8 on memory perfor-
mance. We also explored its potential impact on
neurodegeneration using FDDNP-PET to measure
brain deposition of amyloid plaques and tau tangles.
METHODS
Study Design
The study used a randomized, double-blind,
two-group parallel design comparing placebo to
Theracurmin, a form of curcumin with increased in-
testinal endothelium penetrability.17 Previous research
has shown that healthy human volunteers consum-
ing 30 mg of oral Theracurmin have a 27-fold higher
area under the blood concentration-time curve values
when compared with those consuming standard
curcumin powder.8
Subjects were randomized to either placebo or
Theracurmin (containing 90 mg of curcumin) twice
daily (i.e., 180 mg curcumin/day). We chose a treat-
ment period of 18 months to determine long-term
cognitive effects of curcumin. Moreover, our previ-
ous studies suggested that this time period would be
sufficient to detect significant changes in FDDNP-
PET binding levels in non-demented middle-aged and
older adults.18
The medical center research pharmacy assigned sub-
jects to treatment arms using a randomization table.
The curcumin and placebo were encapsulated and the
color of the active curcumin capsules did not differ
from the placebo capsules. The capsules were tasteless,
but curcumin can change the color of urine. However,
change in urine color was never reported as an adverse
event and unlikely to have led to un-blinding of the
intervention. During baseline assessments, partici-
pants received vital signs, electrocardiograms, serum
electrolytes, thyroid function, and complete blood
counts, as well as a 3-month supply of placebo or
Theracurmin, which they were instructed to begin the
following morning. Subjects returned every 3 months
for placebo or curcumin supplies. Potential adverse
events and use of the supplement or placebo were
checked every 3 months to monitor safety and
compliance.
Subject Selection and Assessment
We performed baseline cognitive assessments on 46
subjects who met study entry criteria from a pool of
259 potential volunteer, who were recruited through
advertisements, media coverage, and referrals from
physicians and families. Our study protocol detailed
the methods and procedures and pre-specified inclu-
sion and exclusion criteria (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:
NCT01383161).
To be included, volunteers needed to have objec-
tive cognitive performance scores and clinical histories
that were consistent with normal aging or MCI (i.e.,
mild neurocognitive disorder) and inconsistent with
dementia (i.e., major neurocognitive disorder).19,20 All
subjects were aged between 50 and 90 years, agreed
to participate for the entire 18 months, had adequate
visual and auditory acuity for neuropsychological
testing, and had screening laboratory tests and elec-
trocardiograms that did not show significant medical
abnormalities that might interfere with the study.
Reasons for exclusion included significant cerebrovas-
cular disease; probable Alzheimer disease or any other
dementia;20,21 neurological or physical illnesses that
can produce cognitive deterioration; inability to
undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or sig-
nificant abnormality on brain MRI; history of
myocardial infarction within the previous year or
unstable cardiac disease; uncontrolled hypertension
(systolic BP > 170 or diastolic BP > 100); significant

 liver or pulmonary disease, diabetes, or cancer; major
depression or any major psychiatric disorder; history
of alcoholism or substance addiction; use of vitamins
other than a standard multivitamin supplement; use
of any medication or supplement containing curcumin,
cognitive enhancing supplements, or investigational
drugs within the previous month or longer, depend-
ing on drug half-life; or evidence of vasogenic edema.
Potential subjects who were regularly consuming
curcumin and unwilling to discontinue it were ex-
cluded from the study. Because some nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen)
can alter FDDNP binding, subjects taking such med-
ication needed to be able to discontinue it for a week
prior to PET scanning.22 The most frequent reasons
for exclusion were illness (N = 70), loss of interest in
participating (N = 50), inability to tolerate MRI (N = 32),
or medication use (N = 23; Figure 1).
At baseline, all subjects were screened to ensure
they met inclusion criteria and received routine
screening laboratory tests, and MRI scans to rule out
reversible causes of cognitive impairment.23 In addi-
tion, subjects were given the Montreal Cognitive
Assessment24 and the Beck Depression Inventory.25 A
neuropsychological test battery15,26 was performed to
assist in excluding subjects with dementia and to
determine whether included subjects had normal aging
or MCI. The battery assessed six cognitive domains:
attention and psychomotor speed (Trail Making Test
A, WAIS-III Digit Symbol Substitution); visuospatial
functioning (WAIS-III Block Design Test, Rey-Osterrieth
Complex Figure Test [copy]); executive functioning
(Trail Making Test B, Stroop Interference [Kaplan
version], F.A.S. Letter Fluency Test); learning (Buschke-
Fuld Selective Reminding Test [SRT][total recall],
Wechsler Memory Scale-3rd Edition [WMS-III] Verbal
Paired Associations I, Benton Visual Retention Test);
delayed recall (Buschke-Fuld SRT [Delayed Recall],
Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test [recall], WMS-
III Verbal Paired Associations II); and language or

 semantic memory (Boston Naming Test, Animal
Naming Test). Subjects also received a memory func-
tioning questionnaire, a standardized measure of
memory self-awareness.27 We used the following di-
agnostic criteria for MCI: 1) patient awareness of a
memory problem, preferably confirmed by another
person such as a family member; 2) cognitive impair-
ment detected with standardized assessment tests;
and 3) ability to perform normal daily activities. To
increase specificity for detecting impairment, we in-
cluded subjects who scored less than 1 standard
deviation below the mean on at least two tests and
whose diagnosis was corroborated by clinical
assessment.
Because previous animal28,29 and human13 research
indicated memory effects of curcumin, we chose two
memory tests as primary outcome measures after 6,
12, and 18 months of treatment. The Buschke SRT30
was the primary outcome measure for verbal memory.
The SRT is a standardized measure of verbal learn-
ing that presents 12 words to the subject who is asked
to immediately recall as many words as possible.
The examiner then presents words that the subject
was unable to recall until the subject can recall all 12
words without prompting twice, or until the examin-
er has presented prompts up to 12 times. The
Consistent Long Term Retrieval score is the number
of words that the subject recalls without receiving
prompts and indicates how well the subject consoli-
dates the new information during the learning phase
(encoding). We also used the Total Recall score (number
of words recalled over the 12 trials), which reflects
immediate recall (short-term memory) for new infor-
mation. The Brief Visual Memory Test-Revised
(BVMT-R)31 was the primary outcome measure for
visual memory. Because a previous human trial13
showed a curcumin effect on sustained attention, we
chose a measure of sustained attention, the Trail Making
Test Part A, as a secondary outcome measure.32
Curcumin may influence mood as well as cognition,13,33
so we repeated the Beck Depression Inventory25 to
determine a possible effect of curcumin on symp-
toms of depression. To ensure that subjects were
compliant in taking either curcumin or placebo and
not consuming additional curcumin outside of the
study, we performed plasma curcumin levels at base-
line and after 18 months of treatment. Curcumin plasma
bioavailability and total curcumin analysis studies were
also performed (methods included in supplementary
material). Subjects were also instructed to avoid con-
suming extra dietary curcumin.
Written informed consent was obtained from all sub-
jects in accordance with the University of California,
Los Angeles, human subjects protection committee pro-
cedures. The trial began in March 2012 and was
completed in April 2016. Cumulative radiation
dosimetry for all PET scans was below the mandated
maximum annual dose and in compliance with state
and federal regulations.
Genetic Analysis
DNA was obtained from blood samples. APOE geno-
types were determined using standard techniques, as
previously described.16 Genetic data were available for
35 of the subjects completing the study.
Scanning Procedures
Data were available from FDDNP-PET scans per-
formed on 30 subjects at baseline and after 18 months
of curcumin supplementation or placebo. Ten sub-
jects included in the study did not have baseline and
post-treatment PET scans available for analysis because
three dropped out before receiving the follow-up scan,
three had technical issues with the scans that invali-
dated the data, and four did not receive scans due to
lack of funding.
FDDNP methods are detailed in previous publica-
tions and the supplementary material.15,16,34–37 In brief,
all scans were performed with participants in a supine
position and with the imaging plane parallel to the
orbitomeatal line. A bolus of FDDNP (320–550 MBq)
was injected via an indwelling venous catheter, and
consecutive dynamic PET scans were performed for
1 hour. Bilateral regions of interest were manually
traced on the early-summed images for the parietal,
medial temporal (limbic regions, including hippocam-
pus, parahippocampal areas, and entorhinal cortex),
lateral temporal, posterior cingulate, anterior cingu-
late, amygdala, hypothalamus, occipital, motor, and
frontal regions. The FDDNP binding data were quan-
tified using Logan graphical analysis with the motor
strip as the reference region. All PET scans were read
and regions of interest drawn by individuals blinded
to clinical assessments and treatment group.

Memory Effects of Curcumin on Non-Demented Adults
 General Statistical Analysis
Before statistical analyses, all data were inspected for
outliers, skewness, kurtosis, and homogeneity of vari-
ance to ensure their appropriateness for parametric
statistical tests. The curcumin and placebo groups were
compared on baseline demographic and clinical char-
acteristics with χ2 statistics for categorical measures and
t tests for continuous measures. All subjects with
baseline data were used to examine all outcomes. Our
primary and secondary outcome measures are con-
tinuous and were analyzed using a mixed-effects
general linear model, as implemented in PROC MIXED
in SAS v 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). We included
treatment group as the between-subject factor, time as
the within-subject factor, and the interaction term
between time and treatment group as predictors. Age
and education level were used as covariates. We also
examined using apolipoprotein E (APOE4) status and
family history of dementia as additional covariates but
findings were substantively similar, so we report results
obtained with models with only age and education as
covariates. Post hoc analyses determined the signifi-
cance of between group differences and within-group
changes. The significance threshold for each of the
outcome measures was set at 0.05 (two-tailed).
RESULTS
Participant Flow and Follow-Up
A total of 46 subjects who met the study inclusion
criteria were randomized; 6 withdrew from partici-
pation after randomization (Figure 1). Of the remaining
40 subjects, 21 belonged to the curcumin group and
19 to the placebo group. One subject randomized to
curcumin dropped out after the 12-month visit (re-
ported heartburn and bloating due to study material),
and two placebo subjects dropped out after the 6-month
visit (one due to loss of interest and the other due to
inability to take the pills). Subjects who withdrew
did not differ significantly from those who com-
pleted the study in mean age or baseline cognitive
measures.
For the curcumin group, mean (SD) follow-up was
18.7 (1.6) months; for the placebo group it was 18.5 (0.5)
months. Treatment groups did not differ signifi-
cantly in baseline demographic variables, age, sex ratio,
proportion with MCI, APOE4 status, family history of
dementia, or in Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Beck
Depression Inventory, or Memory Functioning Ques-
tionnaire scores (Table 1). They did differ significantly
in educational achievement (curcumin group: 17.5 [2.0]
years; placebo group: 15.4 [2.7] years; Table 1). Base-
line levels of free curcumin were 0 ng/mL for both
groups; at 18 months the free curcumin mean (SD) level
(measured randomly throughout the day) was 26.2
(20.1) ng/mL (range, 3.0 to 67.3), and the mean (SD)
placebo group level was 0.1 (0.3) ng/ml (range, 0 to
1.2), confirming that subjects were compliant in taking
either curcumin or placebo and not consuming addi-
tional curcumin outside of the study. The bioavailability
study confirmed Theracurmin’s more rapid absorp-
tion and peak concentration compared with two other
curcumin forms (Figure 2).
Cognitive Outcomes
For the primary verbal memory outcome measure
(Buschke SRT, Consistent Long-Term Recall), the group
by time interaction term was statistically significant
(F(1,37) = 4.4, p = 0.05): The curcumin group showed sig-
nificant improvement from baseline after 18 months
of treatment (change = 20.3, ES = 0.63, t(37) = 3.3,
p = 0.002), and the placebo group did not show sig-
nificant change (change = 1.9, ES = 0.06, t(37) = 0.3,
p = 0.8). The between group effect size was deter-
mined to be 0.68 (Table 2; Figure 3). For the SRT Total
score, the group by time interaction term did not

 achieve statistical significance (F(1,37) = 3.0, p = 0.08);
however, the curcumin group showed significant im-
provement from baseline to 18 months (change = 8.0,
ES = 0.53, t(37) = 3.3, p = 0.002), whereas the placebo
group did not show significant change (change = 1.6,
ES = 0.02, t(37) = 0.6, p = 0.5).
For the primary visual memory outcome measure
(BVMT-R), the group by time interaction was not
significant (F(1,37) = 0.3, p = 0.5), even though the
curcumin group showed significant improvement from
baseline to 18 months (change = 3.7, ES = 0.50, t(37) = 2.7,
p = 0.01) and the placebo group did not (change = 2.0,
ES = 0.26, t(37) = 1.3, p = 0.2). For the BVMT-R
Delay score, the group by time interaction term
did not achieve statistical significance (F(1,37) = 0.2,
p = 0.08); the curcumin group showed significant im-
provement from baseline to 18 months (change = 1.4,
ES = 0.51,
t(37) = 2.9,
p = 0.006),
whereas
the
placebo group did not (change = 0.2, ES = 0.02, t(37) = 0.3,
p = 0.8).
For the secondary outcome measure of attention
(Trail Making Test Part A), the interaction term
(F(1,37) = 4.8, p = 0.04) indicated that the change for the
curcumin group was significantly greater compared
with the change for the placebo group (ES = 0.67). The
curcumin group improved significantly from base-
line to 18 months (change = 8.0, ES = 0.96, t(37) = 4.9,
p < 0.0001), and the placebo group did not show sig-
nificant change (change = 2.8, ES = 0.28, t(37) = 1.7,
p = 0.1). At 18 months, the curcumin group also showed
significant improvements in Beck Depression Inven-
tory scores (change = −1.9, ES = 0.55, t(37) = −2.2, p = 0.04),
and the placebo group did not (change = −0.4, ES = 0.07,
t(37) = −0.5, p = 0.6). Between group changes were not
significantly different (F(1,37) = 1.2, p = 0.3).
FDDNP-PET Scan Results
At baseline, regional FDDNP binding values did
not differ significantly between the curcumin and
placebo treatment groups (Table 3). After 18 months
of treatment, we found significant changes in mean
FDDNP binding in two regions of interest. In the
amygdala, between group changes did not reach sig-
nificance (F(1,27) = 3.7, p = 0.07); however, FDDNP
binding levels declined significantly in the curcumin
group (ES = −0.41, t(27) = −2.1, p = 0.04) whereas in the
placebo group there was no significant change
(ES = 0.08, t(27) = 0.5, p = 0.6). Further, changes in amyg-
dala binding values were significantly correlated with
changes in Beck Depression Inventory scores in the
curcumin group: Spearman r = 0.62, p = 0.02. Changes
in hypothalamic binding values were significantly
different between the curcumin and placebo groups
(F(1,27) = 5.8, p = 0.02; ES = 0.55): The change in the
curcumin group was not significant whereas the
placebo group showed a significant increase after 18
months (ES = −0.30, t(27) = −1.3, p = 0.2 versus ES = 0.26,
t(27) = 2.0, p = 0.05).
Adverse Events
Four curcumin-treated subjects and two placebo-
treated subjects experienced gastrointestinal side effects
(transient abdominal pain, gastritis, or nausea). One
subject receiving curcumin reported a temporary
feeling of heat and pressure in the chest after FDDNP-
PET scanning at baseline.

Kinetics of curcumin absorption of blood
collected at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after capsule
consumption. For the 10 healthy volunteers
enrolled in the bioavailability study (see
supplementary material), three forms of
curcumin were compared. Theracurmin® was
absorbed faster (T-max: 2 hours) than GNC
Herbal Plus Standardized Turmeric® (4 hours;
supplied by GNC [Pittsburgh, PA]) and Meriva® (6
hours; supplied by Indena SpA [Milan, Italy]).
Theracurmin consumption also led to

Memory Effects of Curcumin on Non-Demented Adults
 DISCUSSION
These findings suggest that daily oral ingestion of
a bioavailable and safe form of curcumin improves
memory performance over an 18-month period in
middle-aged and older non-demented adults. More-
over, such daily oral curcumin consumption may lead
to less neuropathological accumulation in the amyg-
dala and hypothalamus.
Volunteers taking Theracurmin demonstrated sig-
nificant memory improvement after 18 months as
measured by the Buschke SRT, and the Consistent
Long-Term Retrieval score showed significant
curcumin–placebo between-group differences,with an
effect size of 0.68. The Consistent Long-Term Retrieval
score reflects the subject’s ability to consolidate new
information (short-term memory) and continuously
recall the target information over time. Previous re-
search has shown that the Buschke SRT is a sensitive
cognitive measure that can predict future cognitive
decline and intervention response38–41 in people with
age-associated memory complaints as well as those
with dementia. The observation that the secondary at-
tention outcome measure (Trail Making Test Part A)
also demonstrated significant between-group differ-
ences further supports the conclusion that long-term
Theracurmin consumption offers benefits to cogni-
tive functioning over an 18-month period.
The
finding
that
curcumin
compared
with
placebo consumption may lead to less FDDNP
binding in the amygdala and the hypothalamus—
brain regions that are part of the limbic system—further
supports these cognitive findings. The amygdala
performs a role in memory processing, decision-
making, and emotional responses. In addition to
linking the nervous system to the endocrine
system, the hypothalamus plays a role in processing
emotional responses, and neurofibrillary degenera-
tion in the hypothalamus affects neurons that
innervate cortical regions involved in Alzheimer
disease.42

improvement from baseline after 18 months of
treatment (change = 20.3, ES = 0.63, t(37) = 3.3,
p = 0.002); the placebo group did not show
significant change (change = 1.9, ES = 0.06,

 Previous research has shown that FDDNP binding
levels in non-demented middle-aged and older
people vary according to symptoms of anxiety and
depression,43 and patients with major depression in late
life show elevated FDDNP binding values.44Moreover,
both preclinical and clinical trials suggest possible an-
tidepressant and antianxiety effects of curcumin.45,46
Such findings suggest that curcumin’s cognitive ben-
efits could be mediated through effects on brain regions
such as the amygdala and hypothalamus that control
both mood and memory. Consistent with this hypoth-
esis was our finding that the curcumin group showed
significant improvements in Beck Depression Inven-
tory scores, whereas the placebo group did not, and
further, increases in amygdala FDDNP binding levels
were significantly associated with mood changes in the
curcumin treated group. Subjects with significant symp-
toms of depression or anxiety were excluded from this
study. If curcumin’s putative effects are mediated in
part through its mood stabilizing impact, these results
may have been greater had we not excluded subjects
with more severe symptoms of depression and anxiety.
Exactly how curcumin may exert cognitive and mood
effects is not certain, but several potential mecha-
nisms could explain our findings. Curcumin reduces
inflammation,47 and heightened brain inflammation has
been linked to both Alzheimer disease and major
depression.48–50 Curcumin also has powerful antioxi-
dant properties, and oxidative stress is central in the
early pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease.51 Curcumin’s
possible brain health benefits also may result from its
disruption of the formation, accumulation, and toxicity
of amyloid plaques; facilitation of macrophage uptake
and ingestion of plaques; anti-proliferative actions on
microglia; interaction with such neurotoxic heavy metals
as cadmium and lead; inhibition of cholesterol forma-
tion; and decreases in serum peroxides.2,3,52–57
As in any study, methodological issues deserve
comment. Only approximately 15% of the screened vol-
unteers were included in the study, and our recruitment
method yielded a sample of motivated, educated, phys-
ically healthy subjects concerned about age-related
memory problems. The sample, therefore, was not rep-
resentative of the general population. As for all PET
imaging studies, several factors can influence results,
including use of concomitant medications and head
motion during imaging.15 In addition, curcumin has
the potential to interfere with FDDNP binding to
amyloid58 and tau,59 and it is important to consider
whether curcumin consumption may have affected
FDDNP binding to plaques and tangles at the 18-
month follow-up scans. This is unlikely, however, for
multiple reasons. Amyloid and tau curcumin binding
experiments reported in the literature have been per-
formed in vitro with brain slices60 or such methods as
X-ray crystallography,61 which do not take into con-
sideration the intestinal or blood–brain barrier transport
properties of curcumin. Moreover, curcumin’s low in-
testinal absorption, rapid metabolism, and systemic
elimination severely limit its central bioavailability.62 In
addition, curcumin penetrability through the blood–
brain barrier has been shown to be negligible.63

Memory Effects of Curcumin on Non-Demented Adults
 complexes, and other strategies have improved its
bioavailability somewhat, but only as defined as in-
creased curcumin blood levels8,64–66 with minimum
effects on curcumin availability to the brain. Thus,
factors other than direct brain amyloid or tau aggre-
gate binding are more likely to explain curcumin’s brain
health effects. Abundant evidence indicates that
curcumin’s in vivo central effect of reducing amyloid
accumulation might derive from multiple activities
beyond direct binding inhibition of aggregate
formation.66 These curcumin effects may be mediated
through the gut-controlled inflammatory processes in
the body, involving multiple pathways, including metal
chelation, limitation of oxidative damage, and reduc-
tion of cholesterol, proinflammatory cytokines, and
lipids.2,3,52–54,56,57,62
The relatively small sample size in this study war-
rants caution in interpreting our results and limits their
generalizability. Another limitation was that we did not
correct for multiple tests in the analyses as this was a
pilot trial. Further, the FDDNP-PET results were on
a subset of the total sample, should be considered ex-
ploratory, and require replication in a larger sample.
We controlled for education in all the analyses, but we
cannot rule out the possibility that the relatively small
but significant difference in educational level between
the two treatment groups may have had an effect. Forty
percent of the sample (N = 16) was diagnosed with
MCI. Although the proportion of MCI subjects did not
differ between the two treatment groups, the number
of subjects with MCI was too small to determine
whether the findings were being driven by those with
or without MCI. We intend to examine MCI and
normal aging subjects separately in a future trial with
a larger sample size.
Despite such limitations, this study has several
strengths, including the relatively long treatment du-
ration with a bioavailable form of curcumin; the focus
on non-demented middle-aged and older adults rather
than subjects with more advanced neurodegeneration;
the use of sensitive cognitive measures to track memory
effects; and exploration of possible concurrent effects
of curcumin on brain plaque and tangle burden. Our
positive findings that daily use of Theracurmin, a
bioavailable form of curcumin, improves memory and
decreases amyloid and tau binding in the amygdala
and hypothalamus are encouraging that this relative-
ly inexpensive and nontoxic treatment may have a
potential for not only improving age-related memory
decline but also preventing or possibly staving off
progression of neurodegeneration and eventually future
symptoms of Alzheimer disease. These results warrant
further study in similar populations to confirm the
observed cognitive benefits of curcumin and eluci-
date the underlying mechanisms responsible for such
effects.
