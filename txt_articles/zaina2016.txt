Background
Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a debilitating condition associated with degeneration of the spine with aging.
Objectives
To evaluate the effectiveness of different types of surgery compared with different types of non-surgical interventions in adults with
symptomatic LSS. Primary outcomes included quality of life, disability, function and pain. Also, to consider complication rates and
side effects, and to evaluate short-, intermediate- and long-term outcomes (six months, six months to two years, five years or longer).
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, five other databases and two
trials registries up to February 2015. We also screened reference lists and conference proceedings related to treatment of the spine.
Selection criteria
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing surgical versus non-operative treatments in participants with lumbar spinal stenosis
confirmed by clinical and imaging findings.
Data collection and analysis
For data collection and analysis, we followed methods guidelines of the Cochrane Back and Neck Review Group (Furlan 2009) and
those provided in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011).
Main results
From the 12,966 citations screened, we assessed 26 full-text articles and included five RCTs (643 participants).
Low-quality evidence from the meta-analysis performed on two trials using the Oswestry Disability Index (pain-related disability) to
compare direct decompression with or without fusion versus multi-modal non-operative care showed no significant differences at six
months (mean difference (MD) -3.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) -10.12 to 2.80) and at one year (MD -6.18, 95% CI -15.03 to
1

 2.66). At 24 months, significant differences favoured decompression (MD -4.43, 95% CI -7.91 to -0.96). Low-quality evidence from
one small study revealed no difference in pain outcomes between decompression and usual conservative care (bracing and exercise) at
three months (risk ratio (RR) 1.38, 95% CI 0.22 to 8.59), four years (RR 7.50, 95% CI 1.00 to 56.48) and 10 years (RR 4.09, 95%
CI 0.95 to 17.58).
Low-quality evidence from one small study suggested no differences at six weeks in the Oswestry Disability Index for patients treated
with minimally invasive mild decompression versus those treated with epidural steroid injections (MD 5.70, 95% CI 0.57 to 10.83;
38 participants). Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ) results were better for epidural injection at six weeks (MD -0.60, 95% CI
-0.92 to -0.28), and visual analogue scale (VAS) improvements were better in the mild decompression group (MD 2.40, 95% CI 1.92
to 2.88). At 12 weeks, many cross-overs prevented further analysis.
Low-quality evidence from a single study including 191 participants favoured the interspinous spacer versus usual conservative treatment
at six weeks, six months and one year for symptom severity and physical function.
All remaining studies reported complications associated with surgery and conservative side effects of treatment: Two studies reported
no major complications in the surgical group, and the other study reported complications in 10% and 24% of participants, including
spinous process fracture, coronary ischaemia, respiratory distress, haematoma, stroke, risk of reoperation and death due to pulmonary
oedema.
Authors’ conclusions
We have very little confidence to conclude whether surgical treatment or a conservative approach is better for lumbar spinal stenosis,
and we can provide no new recommendations to guide clinical practice. However, it should be noted that the rate of side effects ranged
from 10% to 24% in surgical cases, and no side effects were reported for any conservative treatment. No clear benefits were observed
with surgery versus non-surgical treatment. These findings suggest that clinicians should be very careful in informing patients about
possible treatment options, especially given that conservative treatment options have resulted in no reported side effects. High-quality
research is needed to compare surgical versus conservative care for individuals with lumbar spinal stenosis.

Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis
Review question: We reviewed the evidence that compares surgery versus non-surgical treatment for a condition called lumbar spinal
stenosis. This condition occurs when the area surrounding the spinal cord and nerves becomes smaller.
Background: People with lumbar spinal stenosis experience a range of symptoms including back pain, leg pain, numbness and tingling
in the legs and reduced physical function. These symptoms prompt people to seek treatment. One option for treatment is surgery.
Other treatment options include physical therapy, exercise, braces and injections into the spine.
Study characteristics: We included five studies that compared surgical versus non-surgical treatment in a total of 643 people with lumbar
spinal stenosis. Average age of participants in all studies was over 59 years. Follow-up periods ranged from six weeks to 10 years.
Key results: We cannot conclude on the basis of this review whether surgical or non-surgical treatment is better for individuals with
lumbar spinal stenosis. Nevertheless, we can report on the high rate of effects reported in three of five surgical groups, ranging from
10% to 24%. No side effects were reported for any of the conservative treatment options.
Three studies compared spine surgery versus various types of non-surgical treatment. It is difficult for review authors to draw conclusions
from these studies because non-surgical treatments were inadequately described. One study that compared surgery versus bracing and
exercise found no differences in pain. Another study compared surgery versus spinal injections and found better physical function with
injections, and better pain relief with surgery at six weeks. Still another trial compared surgery with an implanted device versus non-
surgical care. This study reported favourable outcomes of surgery for symptoms and physical function.
Quality of the evidence: Evidence obtained by comparing surgery versus non-surgical treatment is of low quality. Well-designed studies
are needed to examine this problem. In particular, researchers need to do a better job of describing the details of non-surgical treatments.

Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis (Review)

Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is “a clinical syndrome of buttock
or lower extremity pain, which may occur with or without back
pain, associated with diminished space available for the neural
and vascular elements in the lumbar spine” (Watters 2008). LSS
can be classified as congenital (developmental), acquired or both
(Botwin 2007). Most cases of LSS occur as acquired degenerative
stenosis, resulting from aging of the spine or following surgery
or infection (Chad 2007; Ciricillo 1993). Mixed stenosis occurs
when degenerative changes exacerbate existing congenital stenosis
(Ciricillo 1993). Regardless of the aetiology, this condition can
cause chronic pain and disability, dramatically reducing quality of
life, mobility and function (Chad 2007).
Recent advances in imaging technology, improvements in diag-
nostic accuracy and aging of the population have contributed to
a marked increase in the diagnosis of LSS (Benoist 2002; Haig
2006; Lurie 2003). LSS has become one of the conditions seen
most frequently in orthopaedic and neurosurgical practice (Deyo
2006) and is the most common reason for spine surgery among
individuals over the age of 65 years (Deyo 2010). Although the
overall rate of surgery for LSS appears to have declined slightly
between 2002 and 2007, the rate of complex fusion procedures in-
creased 15-fold (Deyo 2010). As such, LSS is, and will continue to
be, associated with significant healthcare costs (Ciol 1996; Fanuele
2000; Taylor 1994). Given the significant economic ramifications
associated with treatment for individuals with this increasingly
prevalent diagnosis, identification of effective treatment options
for this population is a matter of priority (Whitman 2003).
Description of the condition
Anatomically, LSS refers to narrowing of the central spinal canal,
lateral recesses or intervertebral foramen, causing compression of
associated neurovascular structures. Degenerative lumbar stenosis
results from changes in the spine that occur with aging, includ-
ing facet joint hypertrophy, loss of intervertebral disc height, disc
bulging, osteophyte formation and hypertrophy of the ligamen-
tum flavum (Atlas 2006). The hallmark of spinal stenosis is neuro-
genic claudication, consisting of lower limb pain and neurological
symptoms exacerbated by walking (Chad 2007; Porter 1996). Ac-
cordingly, because of pain and discomfort in the lower extremities,
people with LSS often avoid walking and have reduced walking
capacity (Iversen 2001; Tomkins-Lane 2012). Patients with LSS
also report physical impairments including poor balance, sensory
loss (numbness or tingling) and muscle weakness in the buttocks
and lower extremities (Iversen 2001; Johnsson 1987; Stucki 1995).
Symptoms generally are intermittent and posture dependent, ap-
pearing with standing and lumbar extension, exacerbated by walk-
ing and relieved by rest in a flexed or seated position (Binder 2002;
Chad 2007). Radicular pain may be due to a combination of me-
chanical compression, inflammatory irritation of neural elements,
vascular congestion and segmental instability (Carragee 2010). No
’gold standard’ for diagnosis of clinical LSS is known; therefore
inclusion criteria for studies to date have been heterogeneous. This
is one limitation of meta-analysis of studies including participants
with LSS.
Description of the intervention
Possible surgical procedures for spinal stenosis include laminec-
tomy, fusion, minimally invasive implants, spinal devices and
prostheses (Postacchini 1999). Conservative treatments include
exercise, manipulation, mobilisation, physical therapy, drugs,
acupuncture, bracing, education and cognitive-behavioural treat-
ments (Haig 2010).
How the intervention might work
Surgery can increase the amount of space in the spinal canal
through removal of portions of the posterior spinal elements (lam-
inae, facets, osteophytes, ligaments, synovitis or synovial cysts);
generally this is referred to as ’decompression’. Removal of these
pathological compressive structures may exacerbate existing insta-
bility or create de novo instability following decompression. Spinal
fusion is sometimes added to the decompression procedure to
avoid or treat this instability. Alternatively, spinal instrumentation
in the form of posterior spacers may be placed to alter spinal align-
ment without fusion, to achieve a position of empirical pain re-
lief. In most patients, this position is characterised by relative flex-
ion and posterior decompression of the stenotic segment achieved
without disruption of normal anatomical structures. Thus, the
goal of surgery is to create a relative flexion to open the foramina
without modifying anatomy at the stenotic level (Carragee 2010).
Conservative treatment can act on pain perception directly (drugs,
physical therapy, acupuncture), or it can improve mobility and
control of movement in the lumbar spine (Negrini 2006), both ac-
tively (exercise) and passively (manipulation, mobilisation). Edu-
cation and cognitive-behavioural treatments can improve pain and
quality of life by giving patients information about their condition
andaboutitsmanagement,therebypromotinghealthybehaviours.
Physical activity can improve overall health and potentially leads
to reduced pain and improved function (Tomkins-Lane 2015).
These latter treatments are frequently administered together with
other approaches to act on both psychological and physical aspects
of the problem.
Why it is important to do this review
Non-surgical interventions are almost always initially recom-
mended in the treatment of patients with LSS (Negrini 2010), but
surgery is generally considered the gold standard. Only a few stud-
ies have compared surgical and non-surgical treatments, and study

 findings are inconsistent (Kovacs 2011; Negrini 2010). Surgery
can lead to side effects including spinal instability that necessi-
tate further operative treatment (frequently spinal fusion). Gener-
ally speaking, the risk of reoperation is approximately 17% (Deyo
2011). New techniques such as insertion of interspinous stand-
alone spacers have shown a high rate of reoperation, with as many
as 27% of patients undergoing a second operation in the first
year (Sobottke 2010). Even worse, some studies have reported
really high risk of major medical complications associated with
surgery, including an overall 3.1% risk of cardiopulmonary com-
plications or stroke, and a 0.4% risk of death within one month,
especially when patients present with co-morbidities (Deyo 2010).
At the same time, evidence regarding conservative treatment has
been limited and vague (Atlas 2006 Tomkins 2010; Tomkins-Lane
2012).
For these reasons, a reliable comparison of treatments is needed.
O B J E C T I V E S
To evaluate the effectiveness of different types of surgery compared
with different types of non-surgical interventions in adults with
symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). Primary outcomes in-
cluded quality of life, disability, function and pain. Also, to con-
sider complication rates and side effects, and to evaluate short-,
intermediate- and long-term outcomes (six months, six months to
two years, five years or longer).

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We considered for inclusion both randomised controlled trials
(RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled studies comparing surgi-
cal procedures versus non-surgical treatments. Randomised stud-
ies are those in which participants are selected truly at random
with a computer-generated sequence used to assign participants,
or closed envelopes, block randomisations and similar approaches.
Quasi-randomised studies are those in which the method of allo-
cating participants to treatment is not strictly random, for exam-
ple, by date of birth, hospital record number or alternation.
Types of participants
We included studies involving adult patients older than 18 years
of age, with age stratified in the analysis. We applied no limitations
on gender or age. We defined inclusion by both clinical findings
and imaging. We defined the symptom and sign complex indi-
cating high confidence in the diagnosis of ’symptomatic LSS’ as
either neurogenic claudication or monoradicular or polyradicular
symptoms that are neuro-anatomically consistent with an area of
pathological stenosis. We needed images to clearly show congeni-
tal or degenerative narrowing, or both, of the spinal canal with dis-
placement or compression or deformity of neural elements. When
patients presented with some degree of degenerative spondylolis-
thesis, we included them only when they also presented with pri-
mary neurological claudication or radicular symptoms. We ex-
cluded those with non-specific low back pain and radicular pain
secondary to primary pathological conditions other than congeni-
tal or degenerative LSS. Excluded conditions were isthmic spondy-
lolisthesis, disc herniation and post-fracture stenosis. For studies
including mixed clinical populations, we contacted study authors
to collect data on eligible patients. When we received no answer,
or when subgroups were not included, we excluded those studies.
Types of interventions
We included all types of surgical procedures (decompression,
spinal fusion, any kind of device or prosthesis) compared with
all types of non-surgical procedures (e.g. exercise, manipulation,
mobilisation, physical therapy, drugs, acupuncture, bracing, edu-
cation and cognitive-behavioural treatments). We did not group
interventions together but separately evaluated the effectiveness
of different types of surgical procedures versus different types of
non-surgical interventions.
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
• Disability and functional status, as measured by a back
pain-specific scale (e.g. Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire
(RMDQ), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)).
• Pain intensity, as measured by a visual analogue or other
pain scale (e.g. visual analogue scale (VAS), numerical rating
scale (NRS), McGill Pain Scale).
• Health-related quality of life (e.g. Short Form (SF)-36 (as
measured by the general health subscale), European
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core
Quality of Life Questionnaire (EuroQol), general health (e.g. as
measured on a VAS scale) or a similarly validated index).
• Walking capacity (e.g. walking distance before participant is
forced to stop because of symptoms of LSS).
Secondary outcomes
Secondary outcome measures included side effects, complications,
failure rates and patient satisfaction. Side effects and complica-
tions could be injuries secondary to the intervention, including
infection, neurological damage and worsening of symptoms.

 Assessment was considered according to the amount of time that
had passed since the intervention was provided (i.e. short-term:
six months; intermediate: up to 24 months; long-term: five years
or longer).
Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
We used the updated search strategy recommended by the
Cochrane Back and Neck Review Group for identifying RCTs
(Furlan 2009), combined with the strategy developed for the re-
view of non-operative treatments for spinal stenosis conducted by
Ammendolia et al (Ammendolia 2011).
We performed a comprehensive search up to 11 February 2015
to identify all relevant studies included in the following electronic
databases.
• Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL) (January 2015, Issue 1 of 12).
• MEDLINE (Ovid SP
, 1946 to Week 1 February 2015) and
MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations (Ovid
SP
, 10 February 2015).
• EMBASE (Ovid SP
, 1980 to Week 7 2015) (on 19
February 2015).
• Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature
(CINAHL; EBSCO, 1981 to 11 February 2015).
• Index to Chiropractic Literature (ICL).
• Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro).
• ClinicalTrials.gov.
• World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical
Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP).
• PubMed.
• Cochrane Back and Neck Review Group Trials Register
(Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS)).
For the 2015 search, we added ClinicalTrials.gov and WHOIC-
TRP to identify ongoing trials; we searched PubMed for stud-
ies not included in MEDLINE by using the strategy devised by
Duffy 2014, and we searched the Cochrane Back and Neck Re-
view Group Trials Register in the CRS for studies not found in
CENTRAL. Full search strategies can be found in Appendix 1.
We placed no limitations on language or date.
Searching other resources
We performed a handsearch and an electronic search for con-
ference proceedings related to treatment of the spine. We also
screened reference lists.
Data collection and analysis
For data collection and analysis, we followed methods guidelines
of the Cochrane Back and Neck Review Group (Furlan 2009) and
those provided in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of
Interventions (Higgins 2011).
Selection of studies
Two independent review authors evaluated search results by read-
ing the titles and abstracts. We obtained the full text of potentially
relevant studies and independently assessed them for inclusion.
We resolved disagreements through discussion with a third review
author.
Data extraction and management
Two independent review authors performed data extraction using
a standardised form to report the most relevant details (Furlan
2009). Extracted data included characteristics of the population,
types of interventions provided, duration of treatment and follow-
up periods and the outcome measures listed above. We reported
all data via a specific Excel form designed for the purpose.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
At least two review authors independently assessed risk of study
bias (Furlan 2009). We evaluated possible bias due to generation
of the allocation sequence, concealment of allocation, blinding,
incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other
sources of bias (see Appendix 2). In cases of disagreement, the two
review authors discussed the assessment and reached a shared deci-
sion. We did not assess inter-author reliability because we reached
agreement on each study evaluation. We scored each criterion as
having high risk, low risk or unclear risk according to the criteria
provided in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of In-
terventions (Higgins 2011).
Measures of treatment effect
We analysed dichotomous outcomes by calculating the risk ratio
(RR) for each trial and expressing the uncertainty in each result
through 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We analysed continuous
outcomes by calculating mean differences (MDs) for studies that
used the same instrument to measure the outcome, and we used
standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% CIs for studies
that used different instruments.
We determined clinical relevance as defined by the following
pooled effect sizes.
• Small: MD < 10% of the scale (e.g. < 10 mm on a 100-mm
VAS); SMD < 0.4; RR < 1.25 or > 0.8 (depending on whether
risk or benefit was reported for the intervention or control
group).
7

 • Medium: MD 10% to 20% of the scale; SMD 0.41 to 0.7;
RR 1.25 to 2.0 or 0.5 to 0.8.
• Large: MD > 20% of the scale; SMD > 0.7; RR > 2.0 or <
0.5 (Higgins 2011).
Review authors assessed the clinical relevance of each included
study by using the five questions outlined in Appendix 3 (Furlan
2009).
Dealing with missing data
In cases of incomplete and missing data, we contacted the authors
of all included studies. We assessed missing data and dropouts or
attrition for each included study, and we discussed and evaluated
the extent to which results and conclusions of the review were
altered by missing data. To avoid potential bias, we did not use
outcomes for which less than 70% of participants allocated to
treatment were reported on at the end of the trial. When data were
reportedasmedianandinterquartile range (IQR),we assumedthat
the median was equivalent to the mean and that the width of the
IQR was equivalent to 1.35 times the standard deviation (Higgins
2011). In studies presenting a range along with the median instead
of an IQR, we estimated the standard deviation as one-quarter of
the range (Higgins 2011). When data were reported in a graph
and not in a table, we estimated means and standard deviations.
When standard deviations were not reported, we attempted to
contact the study authors. When the standard deviation for follow-
up measurements was missing, we used the baseline measure for
subsequent follow-ups. Finally, when no measure of variation was
reported anywhere in the text, we estimated the standard deviation
on the basis of findings of other studies with similar populations
and risk of bias.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We used a Chi2 test to assess for heterogeneity (Higgins 2011). A P
value of the Chi2 test less than 0.05 indicates significant statistical
heterogeneity. We performed the meta-analysis by pooling data
only in cases of clinically homogeneous data.
Assessment of reporting biases
We used a funnel plot to assess the presence of reporting biases.
We evaluated whether asymmetry was due to publication bias or
to a relationship between trial size and effect size (Higgins 2011).
Data synthesis
We combined outcome measures from individual trials through
meta-analysis when possible (clinical comparability of popula-
tions, interventions and outcomes between trials) by using a ran-
dom-effects model.
When meta-analysis was not possible, we qualitatively described
the results.
We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for each out-
come by using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assess-
ment, Development and Evaluation) approach, as recommended
in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions
(Higgins 2011) and adapted in the updated method guidelines of
the Cochrane Back and Neck Review Group (Furlan 2009). Fac-
tors that may decrease the quality of the evidence include study
design and risk of bias, inconsistency of results, indirectness (not
generalisable), imprecision (sparse data) and others (e.g. reporting
bias). We downgraded the quality of the evidence for a specific
outcome according to the performance of studies against these five
factors.
• High-quality evidence: consistent findings among at least
75% of RCTs with low risk of bias; consistent, direct and precise
data; no known or suspected publication biases. Further research
is unlikely to change the estimate or our confidence in the results.
• Moderate-quality evidence: one of the domains not met.
Further research is likely to have an important impact on our
confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.
• Low-quality evidence: two of the domains not met.
Further research is very likely to have an important impact on
our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change
the estimate.
• Very low-quality evidence: three of the domains not met.
We are very uncertain about the results.
• No evidence: No RCTs were identified that addressed this
outcome
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
Given that we conducted the meta-analysis using only two studies,
it was not appropriate to conduct subgroup analyses (Malmivaara
2007; Weinstein 2008).
Sensitivity analysis
Both studies included in the meta-analysis had similar risk of bias;
therefore, we did not expect differences in treatment effects based
on bias, and we did not conduct sensitivity analyses (Malmivaara
2007; Weinstein 2008).

Description of studies
A total of five randomised controlled trials (10 references) met the
inclusion criteria, were included in this review (Amundsen 2000;
Brown 2012; Malmivaara 2007; Weinstein 2008; Zucherman
2004) and are described under Characteristics of included studies.

 Studies included a total of 643 participants, and each study com-
pared some form of surgical intervention versus non-operative
treatment. Investigators randomly assigned 322 participants to
surgical intervention and 321 to non-operative treatment. The
mean age of participants was over 59 years in all studies. The over-
all percentage of male participants was 54%. Follow-up periods
varied significantly and ranged from six weeks to 10 years. One of
the five studies was blinded (Brown 2012).
Results of the search
From the 12,966 citations screened, we assessed 26 full-text arti-
cles and included five RCTs (10 references). We found one ongo-
ing study (Overdevest 2011) and added another study to studies
awaiting classification (Delitto 2015). (Figure 1).

 Included studies
Types of studies
All studies were randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Two also
included an observational arm that was excluded from the analysis
(Amundsen 2000, Weinstein2008). Includedstudiesare described
under Characteristics of included studies.
Study populations
All participants had lumbar spinal stenosis confirmed by clinical
findings and by imaging.
T
echniques
Surgical techniques and types of non-operative treatment varied.
Outcome measures
Outcomes included the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), visual
analogue pain scales (VASs), the Zurich Claudication/Swiss Spinal
Stenosis Questionnaire, walking ability and Short-Form 36 (SF-
36).
A brief summary of the five included studies follows here.
Amundsen 2000 was an RCT that included 100 participants with
LSS. Participants were 54 men and 46 women whose median
age was 59 years. From these individuals, investigators selected a
group S (n = 19) for surgical treatment because of the severity
of their symptoms and a group C (n = 50), with milder pain,
for conservative treatment. They assigned remaining participants
to group R (n = 31) when severity of pain left the physician in
doubtconcerningwhich treatmenttorecommend,thentosurgical
treatment group RS (n = 13) or conservative treatment group RC
(n = 18). The surgical procedure was standardised for the purpose
of nerve decompression by partial or total laminectomy, medial
facetectomy or discectomy. For conservative care, patients were
fitted with an orthosis and were transferred to the rehabilitation
department for one month. Outcomes included visual analogue
pain scale, verbal rating scale, subjective change (better, worse or
unchanged), workstatusandsubjective physician rating (excellent,
fair, unchanged, worse) at six months, 12 months, four years and
10 years.
Brown 2012 was a double-blind, randomised, prospective study
of 38 participants with LSS. Investigators randomly assigned par-
ticipants to two treatment groups, with 21 included in the surgery
group and 17 in the epidural steroid treatment group. The sur-
gical group received the minimally invasive mild decompression
procedure, and the conservative group underwent the epidural
steroid injection procedure. Outcomes included visual analogue
pain scale, Oswestry Disability Index and Zurich Claudication
Questionnaire at six weeks and at 12 weeks.
Malmivaara 2007 was an RCT of 94 participants with LSS. Re-
searchers randomly assigned 50 participants (age 62 ± 9 years) to
the surgical group and 44 (age 63 ± 9) to the non-operative treat-
ment group. The surgical group underwent segmental decompres-
sion and an undercutting facetectomy of the affected area. When
indicated, investigators prescribed participants in the conserva-
tive treatment group non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and
referred them to physiotherapists. Participants were seen one to
three times by a physiotherapist, in addition to the standard visit
provided at each follow-up occasion. Outcomes included an 11-
point numerical pain scale for leg and back, Oswestry Disabil-
ity Index, walking ability (distance without a break measured by
treadmill) and general health status at six, 12 and 24 months.
Weinstein 2008 was a multi-centre RCT of 289 participants with
LSS with a mean age of 65.5 ± 10.5 years; 38% were female. Of
these participants, 138 were assigned to the surgical group, and
151 to the non-surgical group. The protocol for surgery consisted
of standard posterior decompressive laminectomy. The non-surgi-
cal protocol provided “usual care”, which was recommended to in-
clude at least active physical therapy, education or counselling with
home exercise instruction and administration of non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs, if tolerated. Outcomes included SF-36,
Oswestry Disability Index (MODEMS version), Low Back Pain
Bothersomeness Scale, Leg Pain Bothersomeness Scale, Stenosis
Bothersomeness Index and self reported satisfaction at six weeks,
three months, six months and one, two and four years.
Zucherman 2004 was a multi-centre RCT of 191 participants with
LSS, among whom 100 were randomly assigned to the X STOP
surgical procedure group, and 91 to the conservative care group.
Individuals enrolled in the X STOP group underwent surgery
for implantation of an interspinous implant. Those randomly as-
signed to the conservative care group received at least one epidu-
ral steroid injection and could receive non-steroidal anti-inflam-
matory drugs, analgesics and physical therapy. Physical therapy
consisted of back school and modalities such as ice packs, heat
packs, massage, stabilisation exercises and pool therapy. Braces,
such as abdominal binders and corsets, were permitted, but body
jackets and chair-back braces were not allowed. Outcomes in-
cluded SF-36, Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ), Os-
westry Disabilty Index, Worker’s Compensation claim and radio-
graphic changes at six weeks, six months and one year.
Excluded studies
Of 26 full-text studies, we excluded 14. We excluded 7 stud-
ies (9 references) because participants were not randomly as-

 signed (Athiviraham 2007; Atlas 1996; Chang 2005; Hurri 1998;
Mariconda 2002; Ohtori 2014; Paker 2005) and one study be-
cause it included mixed populations (Pearson 2011). One was a
commentary (no original data) (Malmivaara 2007a), one was a re-
view (Croft 2012), one evaluated cost-effectiveness, which was not
an outcome of interest for this review (Tosteson 2011), and one
was a cohort study (Keller 1996). Reasons for exclusion of studies
can be found in the table Characteristics of excluded studies.
Risk of bias in included studies
We found only one study to have an overall low risk of bias (Brown
2012) (Figure 2, Figure 3).

 Random sequence generation (selection bias)
Three studies clearly described low risk of bias for the randomi-
sation process (Brown 2012; Malmivaara 2007, Weinstein 2008),
and the other two studies (Amundsen 2000; Zucherman 2004)
did not provide this information.
Allocation
We considered allocation to be adequate in two studies (Brown
2012; Zucherman 2004) and unclear in the other three studies,
given that study authors did not provide the required information
(Amundsen 2000; Malmivaara 2007; Weinstein 2008).
Blinding
Blinding is very difficult when surgical and non-surgical treat-
ments are compared because of the nature of the interventions.
It is obvious in most cases to participants whether they are un-
dergoing surgical or non-surgical care. Only one study was dou-
ble-blinded, and it was rated as having low risk bias for this cri-
terion (Brown 2012). The other four studies (Amundsen 2000;
Malmivaara 2007; Weinstein 2008; Zucherman 2004) were con-
sidered at high risk of bias for this criterionbecause blinding was
not possible, given the types of interventions compared.
Incomplete outcome data
Only one study presented complete data and was considered at low
risk bias for this criterion (Brown 2012). Three studies (Amundsen
2000; Malmivaara 2007; Zucherman 2004) were considered at
high risk of bias because study authors reported only data for
completers. One study (Weinstein 2008) was rated at high risk of
bias because the number of cross-overs made complete outcome
reporting impossible after the first phase.
Selective reporting
Four studies reported all outcomes presented in the protocol and
were considered at low risk (Brown 2012; Malmivaara 2007;
Weinstein 2008; Zucherman 2004). We considered one study to
be at high risk (Amundsen 2000) because not all outcomes were
reported.
Group similarity at baseline (selection bias)
Groups were similar at baseline for each comparison.
Co-interventions (performance bias)
We noted no imbalance among co-interventions.
Compliance (performance bias)
Risk of bias was unclear in four studies because compliance was
not monitored in the conservative group.
Intention-to-treat analysis
In one study, no intent-to-treat analysis (ITT) was performed be-
cause of the high rate of cross-over; therefore, the study was con-
sidered to be at high risk (Weinstein 2008).
Timing of outcome assessments (detection bias)
Risk of bias was low because all important outcome assessments
for all intervention groups were measured at the same time.
Other potential sources of bias
We found no further risks of bias.
Effects of interventions
See: Summary of findings for the main comparison; Summary
of findings 2
We pooled two of the included studies together for a single
outcome - the Oswestry Disability Index (Malmivaara 2007;
Weinstein 2008; Analysis 1.1). We presented data for the other
three studies (Amundsen 2000; Brown 2012; Zucherman 2004)
individually because of heterogeneity of interventions, study pop-
ulations, outcome measures and duration of follow-up.
Usual conservative treatment versus decompression
with or without fusion
Three studies (414 participants) compared usual conserva-
tive treatment versus decompression with or without fusion
(Amundsen 2000; Malmivaara 2007; Weinstein 2008). The sur-
gical approach consisted of decompression through laminectomy
and eventually spinal fusion in cases of risk of instability. Usual
conservative treatment consisted of varying approaches includ-
ing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, exercise, education,
steroid injections and other modalities. For each case, investigators
presented no clearly defined standard protocol and no description
of the specifics of conservative treatment.
We obtained low-quality evidence from the meta-analysis per-
formed with two trials (320 participants) for the Oswestry Dis-
ability Index (pain-related disability), comparing direct decom-
pression with or without fusion versus multi-modal non-operative
14

 care (Malmivaara 2007; Weinstein 2008) (Figure 4). Investigators
reported no significant differences at six months (mean difference
(MD) -3.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) -10.12 to 2.80) and
at one year (MD -6.18, 95% CI -15.03 to 2.66). At 24 months,
they found a significant difference favouring decompression (MD
-4.43, 95% CI -7.91 to -0.96). Longer follow-up data are available
for only one study, so it was not possible for review authors to
conduct this combined analysis.
Figure 4.

Disability Index, outcome: 1.1 Oswestry Disability Index [%].
Low-quality evidence from one small study including 31 partici-
pants (Amundsen 2000) showed no differences in pain outcomes
between decompression and usual conservative care (bracing and
exercise) at three months (risk ratio (RR) 1.38, 95% CI 0.22 to
8.59), at four years (RR 7.50, 95% CI 1.00 to 56.48) and at 10
years (RR 4.09, 95% CI 0.95 to 17.58) (Figure 5).

Epidural steroid injection versus decompression with
or without fusion
A single very small study including 38 participants (Brown 2012)
found low-quality evidence of no differences at six weeks on the
Oswestry Disability Index for individuals treated with mild de-
compression versus those treated with epidural steroid injections
(MD 5.70, 95% CI 0.57 to 10.83; 38 participants). ZCQ results
were better for epidural injection at six weeks (MD -0.60, 95% CI
-0.92 to -0.28), and VAS improvements were better in the mild
decompression group (MD 2.40, 95% CI 1.92 to 2.88). At 12
weeks, many cross-overs prevented further analysis.
Usual conservative treatment versus interspinous
device
One trial (Zucherman 2004) compared an interspinous spacer
device versus usual conservative care in 191 participants. This trial
provided low-quality evidence favouring the interspinous spacer
at six weeks, six months and one year for symptom severity and
physical function.
Side effects
Two low-quality studies including 69 participants reported no
major side effects (Amundsen 2000; Brown 2012). One study
comparing usual conservative treatment with laminectomy with
or without fusion reported no deep venous thrombosis, no car-
diac problems and no deaths in the surgical procedure group
(Amundsen 2000). One study comparing epidural steroid injec-
tion versus decompression with or without fusion found no safety
differences among groups, with no deaths in either group and no
major complications (dural tear, blood loss requiring transfusion,
nerve root damage, haematoma, infection and rehospitalisation)
(Brown 2012). These two studies reported no minor side effects.
One study including 94 participants compared usual conserva-
tive treatment with decompression with or without fusion and
reported side effects in 12 out of 50 participants in the surgical
group (24%). Eight were perioperative complications - seven le-
sions to the dural sac and one misplaced transpedicular screw - and
four complications arose after surgery, including one case of neural
dysfunction due to a peridural haematoma that led to reoperation
(Malmivaara 2007).
Another study including 289 participants reported a 10% rate of
intraoperative complications, mainly dural tear/spinal fluid leak
(Weinstein 2008). Postoperatively, a further 10% rate of com-
plications was detected in the surgical group, including wound
haematoma, infection and other unspecified problems. The reop-
eration rate at four years was 13%. No deaths were reported within
the first three months after surgery.
One study including 191 participants compared usual conserva-
tive treatment versus an interspinous device and found that 11% of
participants undergoing interspinous spacer implants had side ef-
fects, including spinous process fracture, coronary ischaemia, res-
piratory distress, haematoma and death due to pulmonary oedema
(Zucherman 2004).
Investigators reported no side effects for any of the conservative
treatments.

Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 D I S C U S S I O N
Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) has a significant impact on mobil-
ity, functioning and quality of life. LSS is one of the most com-
monly treated spinal disorders in older adults, and its prevalence
will continue to rise with the aging population. Yet, to date, no
clear standard is known for treatment of LSS. As it stands, the
boundary between conservative treatment and surgery is not well
defined. It is unclear whether either type of treatment is prefer-
able. The objective of this review was to provide a better under-
standing of the respective benefits of surgical versus non-surgical
treatment. Unfortunately, the studies included in this review were
of low quality. Low-quality evidence from three studies shows that
decompression and conservative treatment have similar results for
disability (Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)) at three, six and 12
months (Amundsen 2000; Malmivaara 2007; Weinstein 2008),
and at 24 months, one study reported better results for surgi-
cal decompression (Weinstein 2008). One small study comparing
steroid injections versus mild decompression found low-quality
evidence showing no differences in disability (ODI) at six weeks.
This same study found that injections were better for physical
function (Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ)) and worse
for pain (visual analogue scale (VAS)) compared with mild decom-
pression at six weeks (Brown 2012). Another single study found
low-quality evidence favouring an interspinous device with sur-
gical decompression over conservative treatment at six weeks, six
months and one year of follow-up (Zucherman 2004). One study
is awaiting classification (Delitto 2015), but the results reported
are similar to those described so we don’t expect any change in the
conclusions.
Investigators reported relevant differences for frequency of side ef-
fects, with no side effects reported for the usual conservative care
group. Two studies reported no major side effects for decompres-
sion with or without fusion, but these studies did not report on
minor side effects (Amundsen 2000; Brown 2012). Three stud-
ies reported greater detail on side effects. Of these three studies,
Weinstein 2008 reported a 10% rate of perioperative complica-
tions, with a further 10% after surgery; Zucherman 2004 reported
a combined rate of 11% for perioperative and postoperative side
effects; and Malmivaara 2007 reported a side effect rate of 24%.
Given the overall similarity in efficacy, care providers should con-
sider the risk of side effects when proposing surgical options to
patients. A side effect rate of 10% to 24% for surgery without
clearly superior benefit suggests that clinicians should be very care-
ful when informing patients about possible treatment options, es-
pecially given that conservative care options had no associated side
effects.
One major limitation in the examination of each of these trials
is the lack of a standard conservative treatment method. Stud-
ies included different modalities applied in various ways, case by
case without a real protocol. It is understandable that conservative
treatment approaches are multi-modal, potentially involving dif-
ferent approaches. However, this does not preclude a description
of the specific approaches. If we are to understand the effects of
conservative treatment, we need to know exactly which type of
treatment was applied. Ideally, to properly assess the efficacy of
non-surgical treatment approaches, future studies should aim to
isolate a specific approach with a clearly defined treatment plan.
For example, future studies could compare one type of surgical
approach versus a specific aerobic exercise programme, or versus a
defined injection protocol. This review demonstrates a clear dis-
crepancy in the description of treatment approaches. A very pre-
cise description of surgical procedures was available in all of the
included studies, and the description of conservative protocols was
poor, or absent, in all studies. This discrepancy could be explained
by the fact that the principal investigators in the included studies
are surgeons. The need for collaboration between surgical experts
and conservative care specialists is clear when future studies are
designed to compare surgery versus conservative treatments for
LSS.
Another major limitation of available evidence is the lack of stan-
dard outcome tools. It is difficult to compare trials when the choice
of outcomes is so heterogeneous. Outcome tools most commonly
usedcurrentlyinclude visual analogue painscalesandvariousques-
tionnaires related to disability, physical function, symptoms and
quality of life. A few trials have employed objective measures, in-
cluding treadmill tests of walking. Recently the National Institutes
on Health (NIH) Pain Consortium charged a Research Task Force
to draft standards for research on chronic low back pain (Deyo
2014). This set of standard outcomes could be used in the study
of LSS, augmented by LSS-specific outcomes, until a standard for
outcomes of LSS has been defined. Additionally, with respect to
outcomes, the study of LSS could benefit from the introduction
of objective measures of function. Such measures are powerful be-
cause they are not subject to the biases associated with self report.
Both capacity (how much an individual can do) and performance
(what one does in day-to-day life) are important aspects of func-
tion that provide us with a greater understanding of patient base-
line function and response to treatment. The Self-Paced Walking
Test is a validated and reliable measure of walking capacity that was
designed specifically for assessment of LSS (Tomkins 2009). Ac-
celerometersserve as a validated means of assessing performance in
LSS (Tomkins-Lane 2012b). Future studies of LSS should aim to
include objective measures of function that allow unbiased com-
parison of function between groups.
Summary of main results
This review analysed five RCTs (10 references) consisting of 643
participants and comparing different surgical procedures and con-
servative approaches. All five studies applied a decompression
modality, varying from standard decompression with or without
fusion to less invasive approaches based on interspinous devices.
For conservative treatment, researchers applied different modali-
18

 ties, including bracing, physical therapy, epidural steroid injection
and other modalities that were not well described.
On the whole, these studies provide conflicting low-quality evi-
dence on the effectiveness of surgery versus conservative treatment
for LSS. Study results preclude conclusions regarding whether sur-
gical or non-surgical treatment provides better outcomes for peo-
ple with LSS.
Surgical groups demonstrated high side effect rates, and conserva-
tive treatment groups demonstrated no complications. Further re-
search is needed to compare these approaches. Specifically, studies
comparing surgery versus well-defined protocols of non-surgical
treatment are warranted.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
The need for additional research on this topic is obvious. How-
ever, study of treatments for LSS is hindered by lack of clear diag-
nostic criteria. It is difficult to combine studies for meta-analyses
when definitions of the condition and therefore inclusion criteria
are variable. Although major clinical signs, including neurogenic
claudication, and flexion-induced symptom relief are considered
hallmarks of the condition, no standard for diagnosis is known.
When applying evidence from studies of LSS, we must make as-
sumptions about the diagnoses of participants involved in the tri-
als, with awareness that these participant groups likely are not ho-
mogenous.
Quality of the evidence
The overall quality of the evidence was low. The most common
issues include lack of blinding, participant cross-over limiting the
applicability of ITT and small sample size.
Potential biases in the review process
Strengths of this review include direct comparison of surgical and
non-surgical approaches with all modalities included and precise
inclusion criteria for patients based on both clinical and radiolog-
ical data.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
The literature comparing surgical versus non-surgical approaches
is inconsistent. A previous systematic review on this topic found
more evidence in favour of the surgical approach (Kovacs 2011).
However, in contrast to this review, Kovacs et al included a
trial on treatment for spondylolisthesis (Weinstein 2007). A re-
cent Cochrane systematic review, based on a previous paper
(Ammendolia 2012), focused on non-surgical treatment for lum-
bar spinal stenosis. Authors of this review reached a conclusion
similar to ours: Current evidence for non-operative care is of low
and very low quality, prohibiting the generation of recommenda-
tions to guide clinical practice (Ammendolia 2013).

Implications for practice
Current evidence comparing surgical versus non-surgical care for
lumbar spinal stenosis is of low quality. For this reason, we cannot
conclude whether a surgical or a conservative approach is better
for lumbar spinal stenosis, nor can we provide new recommenda-
tions to guide clinical practice. Nevertheless, given the high rates
of side effects associated with surgery, clinicians should be cautious
when proposing surgery for LSS, and patients should be properly
informed about the risks. This review also highlights the dearth of
high-quality studies comparing surgical versus non-surgical treat-
ment options. In particular, studies with detailed protocols and
descriptions of non-surgical treatments are lacking.
Implications for research
Given the prevalence and economic ramifications of LSS, high-
quality research comparing surgical versus conservative care is
needed. Future studies must take particular care to standardise and
adequately describe conservative protocols. Finally, research into
treatment for LSS would be much improved by development of
standard diagnostic criteria and clinical outcomes.

Methods
Randomised controlled trial
Participants
100 patients with symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis, 54 men and 46 women whose
median age was 59 years (range 16 to 77 years). From these patients, a group S (n =
19) was selected for surgical treatment because of the severity of their symptoms, and a
group C (n = 50), with milder pain, was selected for conservative treatment. Remaining
patients, group R (n = 31), whose severity of pain left the physician in doubt concerning
which treatment to recommend, was randomly assigned to surgical treatment (group RS
(n = 13) or conservative treatment (group RC (n = 18)
Inclusion criteria: sciatic pain in the leg(s), with or without pain in the back, together
with radiological signs of stenosis and compression of clinically afflicted nerve root(s)
Exclusion criteria: bulging or herniated disc, spondylolysis, coxarthrosis, gonarthrosis,
arterial insufficiency in the legs, polyneuropathy, concomitant serious disease, previous
surgery on the back
Interventions
Surgical procedure: standardised for the purpose of nerve decompression by partial or
total laminectomy, medial facetectomy, discectomy and/or removal of osteophytes from
the vertebral margins or facet joints. Hypertropic ligamenta flava were removed if nec-
essary. No fusions were performed
Conservative treatment: fitted with an orthosis and transferred to the rehabilitation
department for 1 month. No regular physiotherapy was given, except for instruction and
“back school”
Outcomes
Outcomes: Visual Analogue Pain Scale, Verbal Rating Scale, Subjective Change (bet-
ter, worse or unchanged), Work Status, Subjective Physician Rating (excellent, fair, un-
changed, worse)

Methods
Double-blind randomised prospective study
Participants
38 participants were randomly assigned to 2 treatment groups, with 21 included in the
mild group and 17 in the ESI group
Inclusion criteria: patients with symptomatic LSS with painful lower limb neurogenic
claudication and hypertrophic ligamentum flavum as a contributing factor. All patients
were at least 18 years of age, had previously failed conservative therapy and presented
with an Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score > 20. Radiological evidence showed LSS
(L3-L5), ligamentum flavum > 2.5 mm confirmed by preoperative MRI or CT, central
canal cross-sectional area £ 100 mm2 and anterior listhesis confirmed at £ 5.0 mm for
all patients. All were able to walk at least 10 feet unaided before they were limited by
pain
Exclusion criteria: prior surgery at the intended treatment level or previous treatment
with epidural steroids. History of recent spinal fracture, disabling back or leg pain from
causes other than LSS, fixed spondylolisthesis
> grade 1, disc protrusion or osteophyte formationor excessive facet hypertrophy. Patients
with bleeding disorders, current use of anticoagulants or wound healing pathologies
deemed to compromise outcomes, such as diabetes, cancer, and severe COPD; and those
who had used ASA or NSAID within 5 days of treatment were not eligible
Finally, patients who were pregnant or breastfeeding, unable to lie prone for any reason
with anaesthesia support, unable to give informed consent, on Workman’s Compensation
or considering litigation associated with back pain were excluded
Interventions
Conservative treatment (epidural steroid treatment): Participants received 80 mg of
triamcinolone acetate (40 mg in diabetic patients) mixed with 6 mL of preservative-free
saline injected in divided doses at treated levels. Injections were delivered at the level
of pathology with fluoroscopy and radiographic contrast used to document accurate

placement of the steroid into the epidural space. In addition, skin anaesthesia and a small
incision, followed by trocar placement under fluoroscopy as with the mild procedure,
were performed. No bone or tissue was removed, and thus, no decompression procedure
was performed. Wounds were dressed and cared for postoperatively identically to those
in the mild treatment group. Individuals randomly assigned to mild received no steroid
Surgical treatment: mild lumbar decompression procedure performed. Mild devices are
designed to access the interlaminar space from the posterior lumbar spine, enabling re-
moval of small portions of lamina and hypertrophic ligamentum flavum, thereby achiev-
ing lumbar decompression. Initially, the mild patient is placed in the prone position for
posterior spinal access. Frequently, a bolster is used to open the spinal anatomy for treat-
ment. An epidurogram is performed at the beginning of the procedure for the purpose of
identifying the border of the dural and epidural space relative to the ligamentum flavum
and interlaminar space. On the basis of these visual landmarks, the mild trocar and portal
system is advanced under manual control and is positioned under fluoroscopic guidance.
The trocar is then removed, and the 6-gauge mild portal is secured in place, with the
portal stabiliser becoming the percutaneous working port for the procedure. The bone
sculpter rongeur is advanced through the secured portal to the laminar bone surface.
This device is used to precisely cut and remove very small pieces of bone until access to
the ligamentous tissue has been created. The mild tissue sculpter is then placed through
the portal and through the laminotomy to excise portions of hypertrophic ligamentum
flavum. Progressive tissue cuts are performed to the inferior edge and under the ventral
surface of the lamina, under fluoroscopic guidance. The amount of decompression is
assessed through visual observation of epidurogram contrast flow, as the flow becomes
thicker and straighter. Once the procedure is complete, the mild portal and stabiliser
assembly is removed. No implants are left behind, and the site is closed with a sterile
adhesive strip. The mild procedure is usually performed with only light sedation and
local anaesthetic

Methods
Randomised controlled trial
Participants
94 participants were randomly assigned to a surgical or non-operative treatment group:
50 (age 62 ± 9) and 44 participants (63 ± 9), respectively
Inclusion criteria: back pain radiation to lower limbs or buttocks; fatigue or loss of
sensation in the lower limbs aggravated by walking; persistent pain without progressive
neurological dysfunction; imaging techniques: spinal canal narrowing, sagittal diameter
of the dural sac < 10 mm2 or planimetrically assessed cross-sectional dural area < 75 mm;
duration of symptoms and signs > 6 months; clinical signs and symptoms corresponding
to segmental radiographic level of stenosis; severity of the disease justifying surgical or
non-operative treatment
Exclusion criteria: severe LSS with intractable pain and progressive neurological dysfunc-
tion, suggesting forthcoming surgical treatment; mild LSS, characterised by radiographic
narrowing of the lumbar spinal canal, but clinical signs and symptoms feeble enough
to exclude surgical intervention; spinal stenosis not caused by degeneration, e.g. con-
genital spinal stenosis; spondylolysis and spondylolytic spondylolisthesis; previous back
operation due to spinal stenosis or instability; lumbar herniated disc diagnosed during
last 12 months; another specific spinal disorder, e.g. ankylosing spondylitis, neoplasm or
metabolic disease; intermittent claudication due to atherosclerosis; severe osteoarthrosis
or arthritis causing dysfunction of the lower limbs; neurological disease causing impaired
function of the lower limbs, including diabetic neuropathy; psychiatric disorders; alco-
holism
Interventions
Surgical group: segmental decompression and an undercutting facetectomy of the af-
fected area performed. Presence or risk of lumbar instability was, at the surgeon’s discre-
tion, treated by fusion of the lumbar spine, if necessary, augmented by transpedicular
instrumentation. Treated individuals also received a brochure and instructions about

pain relief and management
Conservative treatment: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs prescribed when indi-
cated and individuals referred to physiotherapists. Participants were seen 1 to 3 times
by a physiotherapist, in addition to the standard visit at each follow-up occasion. The
physiotherapist gave all participants a printed brochure describing the nature of spinal
stenosis, characteristic symptoms and signs of the disease and the principles of activation
and physical training
Participants were encouraged to use their back in a normal way. Pain-relieving body pos-
tures were taught to participants as well as basic ergonomics related to lifting and carry-
ing. Individually structured programmes included trunk muscle endurance and stretch-
ing-type exercises. Additional individual physiotherapy consisting of passive treatment
methods (such as ultrasound and transcutaneous nerve stimulation) and/or active back
exercises was prescribed by a physiatrist to 24% (10 participants) of the non-operative
study group
Outcomes
Outcomes: 11-point numerical pain scale for leg and back, Oswestry Disability Index,
walking ability (distance without a break measured by treadmill), General Health Status
(very good, quite good, average, quite poor, very poor)
Time points: 6, 12 and 24 months

Methods
Multi-centre randomised clinical trial
Participants
Nine centres randomly assigned 200 participants between May of 2000 and July of 2001,
in a prospective, controlled trial. Of 200 participants enrolled in this study, 191 were
treated: 100 in the X STOP group and 91 in the conservative group. Most of the 9
patients from conservative group who withdrew from the study before receiving their
initial epidural injection entered the study with the hope of being randomly assigned to
the X STOP group
Inclusion criteria: ≥ 50 years of age with leg, buttock or groin pain, with or without
back pain, that could be relieved during flexion; able to sit for 50 minutes without pain
and to walk 50 or more feet; completed ≥ 6 months of non-operative therapy. Stenosis
was confirmed by CT or MRI scans at 1 or 2 levels
Primary exclusion criteria: fixed motor deficit, cauda equina syndrome,
significant lumbar instability, previous lumbar surgery, significant peripheral neuropathy
or acute denervation secondary
to radiculopathy, scoliotic Cobb angle > 25°, spondylolisthesis > grade 1.0 (on a scale
of 1 to 4) at the affected level, sustained pathological fractures or severe osteoporosis,
obesity, active infection or systemic disease, Paget’s disease or metastasis to the vertebrae,
steroid use for longer than 1 month within 12 months preceding the start of the study
Interventions
Participants enrolled in the X STOP group underwent surgery for implantation of the
interspinous implant. Those randomly assigned to the conservative group received ≥
1 epidural steroid injection and could receive non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
analgesics and physical therapy. Physical therapy consisted of back school and modalities
such as ice packs, heat packs, massage, stabilisation exercises and pool therapy. Braces,
such as abdominal binders and corsets, were permitted, but body jackets and chair-back
braces were not allowed

Appendix 2. Criteria for judging risk of bias
Random sequence generation (selection bias)
Selection bias (biased allocation to interventions) due to inadequate generation of a randomised sequence
Risk of selection bias is low if investigators describe a random component in the sequence generation process such as referring to a
random number table, using a computer random number generator, tossing a coin, shuffling cards or envelopes, throwing dice, drawing
lots and minimising (minimisation may be implemented without a random element; this is considered equivalent to being random).
Risk of selection bias is high if investigators describe a non-random component in the sequence generation process such as sequence
generated by odd or even date of birth, date (or day) of admission or hospital or clinic record number; or allocation by judgement of
the clinician, preference of the participant, results of a laboratory test or a series of tests or availability of the intervention.
Allocation concealment (selection bias)
Selection bias (biased allocation to interventions) due to inadequate concealment of allocations before assignment
Risk of selection bias is low if participants and investigators enrolling participants could not foresee assignment because one of the
following, or an equivalent method, was used to conceal allocation: central allocation (including telephone, Web-based and pharmacy-
controlled randomisation); sequentially numbered drug containers of identical appearance; or sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed
envelopes.
45
Surgical versus non-surgical treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Risk of bias is high if participants or investigators enrolling participants could possibly foresee assignments and thus introduce selection
bias such as allocation based on using an open random allocation schedule (e.g. a list of random numbers); assignment envelopes
without appropriate safeguards (e.g. if envelopes were unsealed or non-opaque, or were not sequentially numbered); alternation or
rotation; date of birth; case record number; or other explicitly unconcealed procedures.
Blinding of participants
Performance bias due to knowledge of allocated interventions by participants during the study
Risk of performance bias is low if blinding of participants was ensured and it was unlikely that blinding could have been broken; or if
no blinding or incomplete blinding was provided but review authors judged that the outcome is not likely to be influenced by lack of
blinding.
Blinding of personnel/care providers (performance bias)
Performance bias due to knowledge of allocated interventions by personnel/care providers during the study
Risk of performance bias is low if blinding of personnel was ensured and it was unlikely that blinding could have been broken; or if
no blinding or incomplete blinding was provided but review authors judged that the outcome is not likely to be influenced by lack of
blinding.
Blinding of outcome assessor (detection bias)
Detection bias due to knowledge of allocated interventions by outcome assessors
Risk of detection bias is low if blinding of the outcome assessment was ensured and it was unlikely that blinding could have been
broken; or if no blinding or incomplete blinding was provided but review authors judged that the outcome is not likely to be influenced
by lack of blinding, or:
• for participant-reported outcomes in which the participant was the outcome assessor (e.g. pain, disability): low risk of bias for
outcome assessors if low risk of bias for participant blinding (Boutron 2005);
• for outcome criteria that are clinical or therapeutic events that will be determined by the interaction between patients and care
providers (e.g. co-interventions, length of hospitalisation, treatment failure) and in which the care provider was the outcome assessor:
low risk of bias for outcome assessors if low risk of bias for care providers (Boutron 2005); and
• for outcome criteria assessed from data obtained from medical forms: low risk of bias if treatment or adverse effects of treatment
could not be noticed in the extracted data (Boutron 2005).
Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias)
Attrition bias due to quantity, nature or handling of incomplete outcome data
Risk of attrition bias is low if no outcome data were missing; reasons for missing outcome data were unlikely to be related to the true
outcome (for survival data, censoring unlikely to introduce bias); missing outcome data were balanced in quantity, with similar reasons
for missing data across groups; for dichotomous outcome data, the proportion of missing outcomes compared with the observed event
risk was not sufficient to have a clinically relevant impact on the intervention effect estimate; for continuous outcome data, the plausible
effect size (differences in means or standardised differences in means) among missing outcomes was not sufficient to have a clinically
relevant impact on observed effect size, or missing data were imputed using appropriate methods (if dropouts are very large, imputation
using even ’acceptable’ methods may still suggest high risk of bias) (van Tulder 2003). Percentages of withdrawals and dropouts should
not exceed 20% for short-term follow-up and 30% for long-term follow-up and should not lead to substantial bias (these percentages
are commonly used but are arbitrary and are not supported by literature) (van Tulder 2003).

Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 Selective reporting (reporting bias)
Reporting bias due to selective outcome reporting
Risk of reporting bias is low if the study protocol is available and all of the study’s prespecified (primary and secondary) outcomes of
interest in the review were reported in the prespecified way, or if the study protocol is not available but published reports clearly include
all expected outcomes, including those that were prespecified (convincing text of this nature may be uncommon).
Risk of reporting bias is high if not all of the study’s prespecified primary outcomes were reported; one or more primary outcomes were
reported using measurements, analysis methods or subsets of the data (e.g. subscales) that were not prespecified; one or more reported
primary outcomes were not prespecified (unless clear justification for their reporting is provided, such as an unexpected adverse effect);
one or more outcomes of interest in the review were reported incompletely so that they cannot be entered in a meta-analysis; the study
report failed to include results for a key outcome that would be expected to have been reported for such a study.
Group similarity at baseline (selection bias)
Bias due to dissimilarity at baseline for the most important prognostic indicators.
Risk of bias is low if groups were similar at baseline for demographic factors, value of main outcome measure(s) and important prognostic
factors (examples in the field of back and neck pain include duration and severity of complaints, vocational status and percentage of
participants with neurological symptoms) (van Tulder 2003).
Co-interventions (performance bias)
Bias because co-interventions were different across groups
Risk of bias is low if no co-interventions were provided, or if they were similar between index and control groups (van Tulder 2003).
Compliance (performance bias)
Bias due to inappropriate compliance with interventions across groups
Risk of bias is low if compliance with the interventions was acceptable based on reported intensity or dosage, duration, number and
frequency for both index and control intervention(s). For single-session interventions (e.g. surgery), this item is irrelevant (van Tulder
2003).
Intention-to-treat analysis
Risk of bias is low if all randomly assigned participants were reported and analysed in the group to which they were allocated by
randomisation.
Timing of outcome assessments (detection bias)
Bias because important outcomes were not measured at the same time across groups
Risk of bias is low if all important outcome assessments for all intervention groups were measured at the same time (van Tulder 2003).
Other bias
Bias due to problems not covered elsewhere in the table
Risk of bias is low if the study appears to be free of other sources of bias not addressed elsewhere (e.g. study funding).

 Appendix 3. Questions for clinical relevance
• Are participants described in detail so that you can decide whether they are comparable with patients seen in your practice?
• Are interventions and treatment settings described well enough that you can provide the same for your patients?
• Were all clinically relevant outcomes measured and reported?
• Is the size of the effect clinically important?
• Are likely treatment benefits worth potential harms?

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
Given that we conducted the meta-analysis using only two studies, it was not appropriate to conduct subgroup analyses (Malmivaara
2007; Weinstein 2008).
Sensitivity analysis
Studies included in the meta-analysis had similar risk of bias; therefore, we did not expect differences in treatment effect based on bias,
and we did not conduct sensitivity analyses (Malmivaara 2007; Weinstein 2008).
