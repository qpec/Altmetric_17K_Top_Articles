IMPORTANCE Early and accurate in vivo diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is
necessary for quickly distinguishing treatable from untreatable rapidly progressive dementias
and for future therapeutic trials. This early diagnosis is becoming possible using the real-time
quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) seeding assay, which detects minute amounts of the
disease-specific pathologic prion protein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or olfactory mucosa
(OM) samples.
OBJECTIVE To develop an algorithm for accurate and early diagnosis of CJD by using the
RT-QuIC assay on CSF samples, OM samples, or both.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this case-control study, samples of CSF and OM were
collected from 86 patients with a clinical diagnosis of probable (n = 51), possible (n = 24), or
suspected (n = 11) CJD and 104 negative control samples (54 CSF and 50 OM). The CSF and
OM samples were analyzed using conventional RT-QuIC. The CSF samples underwent further
testing using improved RT-QuIC conditions. In addition, the diagnostic performance of a
novel, easy-to-use, gentle flocked swab for sampling of OM was evaluated. Data were
collected from January 1 to June 30, 2015.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES Correlations between RT-QuIC results and the final diagnosis
of recruited patients.
RESULTS Among the 86 patients (37 men [43%] and 49 women [57%]; mean [SD] age,
65.7 [11.5] years) included for analysis, all 61 patients with sporadic CJD had positive RT-QuIC
findings using OM or CSF samples or both for an overall RT-QuIC diagnostic sensitivity of
100% (95% CI, 93%-100%). All patients with a final diagnosis of non–prion disease (71 CSF
and 67 OM samples) had negative RT-QuIC findings for 100% specificity (95% CI,
94%-100%). Of 8 symptomatic patients with various mutations causing CJD or
Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome, 6 had positive and 2 had negative RT-QuIC
findings for a sensitivity of 75% (95% CI, 36%-96%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A proposed diagnostic algorithm for sporadic CJD combines
CSF and OM RT-QuIC testing to provide virtually 100% diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in
the clinical phase of the disease.

S
poradicCreutzfeldt-Jakobdisease(CJD)isthemostcom-
mon form of human transmissible spongiform encepha-
lopathy or prion disease. Genetic CJD, Gerstmann-
Sträussler-Scheinkersyndrome,andfatalfamilialinsomniaalso
belong to this group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders. Cri-
teria for the diagnosis of probable sporadic CJD include the fol-
lowing:thepresenceofdementia;atleast2clinicalsignsamong
visualdisturbances,ataxia,extrapyramidalorpyramidalsigns,
myoclonus, and akinetic mutism; and the presence of peri-
odic sharp and slow wave complexes in the electroencepha-
logram, a positive test result for 14-3-3 protein in the cerebro-
spinal fluid (CSF), or bilateral high-signal abnormalities in the
caudate and/or putamen at diffusion-weighted imaging or
fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences of magnetic
resonance imaging of the brain.1 Definite diagnosis still relies
on neuropathologic examination or the detection of the CJD-
specific abnormal prion protein (PrPCJD) in the central ner-
vous system tissue.2
However, patients with sporadic CJD show great variabil-
ity in clinical signs and pathologic lesions, partially depend-
ing on the polymorphic methionine (M) or valine (V) at codon
129 and the glycotype of protease-resistant PrP (types 1 and 2)
that accumulates in brain.3-5 Because of this phenotypic vari-
ability,accurateandearlyintravitamdiagnosisofsporadicCJD
is often challenging, requiring the combination of clinical signs
and instrumental or biochemical findings that usually occur
in the late stage of disease. The sensitivity of these diagnostic
criteria for sporadic CJD based on the analysis of probable and
definite cases has been 83%, with a specificity of 71%.1
The real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) as-
say detects femtograms of PrPCJD from all subtypes of spo-
radic CJD,6-12 and previous applications of RT-QuIC to CSF (eg,
PQ-CSF) have given diagnostic sensitivities of 77% to 91% and
specificities of 98.5% to 100%.7,9,13-15 A second-generation im-
proved RT-QuIC assay for CSF samples (IQ-CSF) has in-
creased sensitivity to 96%.9 Finally, the application of RT-QuIC
to brushings from the olfactory mucosa (OM) has shown a sen-
sitivity of at least 97% and a specificity of 100%.16,17
In the present study, we used RT-QuIC to analyze CSF and
OM samples from 86 patients referred to the Italian CJD sur-
veillance system to determine the accuracy of the test at the
time of CJD diagnosis. In addition, we propose a diagnostic al-
gorithm for optimal diagnosis of suspected CJD based on RT-
QuIC analysis of CSF and OM.
Methods
Study Participants
This study included 86 patients referred to the Italian surveil-
lance system because of clinical suspicion of CJD. Final diag-
nosis of these patients was established at death or when a defi-
nite alternative diagnosis was available. Diagnosis of human
prion disease was made according to internationally estab-
lished criteria, including magnetic resonance imaging as a sup-
portive investigation (eTable 1 in the Supplement).1,2 Sixty-
nine patients had a final diagnosis of sporadic CJD or genetic
prion disease, whereas 17 had non-CJD. Negative control CSF
samples were collected from 54 patients with clinical diagno-
ses of other neurologic disorders. Olfactory mucosa samples
were collected from 27 patients with other neurologic disor-
ders and 23 patients without neurologic disorders.
This study was approved by the ethical committees of the
Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata of Verona, Ve-
rona,Italy(UV),andtheIstitutoSuperiorediSanità,Rome,Italy
(ISS), which is recognized by the Office for Human Research
Protections of the US Department of Health and Human Ser-
vices. Written informed consent for participation in research
was obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki
(1964-2008)18 and the Additional Protocol on the Convention
of Human Rights and Biomedicine Concerning Biomedical Re-
search (2005).19 All OM samples were obtained after written
informed consent from each patient or their representatives.
We performed RT-QuIC testing of these specimens at Rocky
Mountain Laboratories, Hamilton, Montana (RML), under ex-
emption 11517 provided to one of us (B.C.) by the Office of Hu-
man Subjects Research of the National Institutes of Health.
OM Brushing Procedure and Sample Analyses
Data were collected from January 1 to June 30, 2015. A step-
by-step tutorial video of the nasal brushing procedure is avail-
able at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYb9W3u6uMY.
This procedure was performed as previously described16 using
flocked swabs (FLOQSwabs; Copan Italia), a cytobrush (Kito-
brush; Kaltek), or both. In addition, to reduce the potential risk
for prion contamination, patients and medical staff wore ad-
equatepersonalprotectionequipmentfortheprocedure(which
is not fully depicted in the tutorial video), including a dispos-
able shirt and surgical cap, leaving visible only the access to
the patient’
s nostrils. An absorbent cloth was used to cover the
patient’
s mouth to avoid dispersion of oral secretions in case
of sneezing after OM sample collection. Olfactory mucosa
samples were taken by 19 trained otolaryngologists (includ-
ing L.S. and G. Tonoli) or by 67 otolaryngologists instructed
by the tutorial video and were stored at −80°C until assayed.
We performed cytologic and immunocytochemical
analyses to evaluate the quality of OM sampling and the rela-
tive amounts of olfactory neurons collected. Cytocentrifuged
preparations of OM samples were processed as previously
Key Points
Question How can diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease be
optimized using cerebrospinal fluid and nasal swabbing samples?
Findings In this case-control laboratory analysis, a diagnostic
algorithm had 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity for 61 cases
of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease relative to 71 non–prion
disease cases using real-time quaking-induced conversion analysis
of cerebrospinal fluid and/or olfactory mucosa samples. The
sensitivity for genetic prion diseases was 75%, and gentler nasal
swabs worked as well as cytobrushes for olfactory mucosa
sampling.
Meaning Real-time quaking-induced conversion testing can
provide rapid and accurate intra vitam diagnosis of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

described.16 Immunocytochemical studies were performed
using a rabbit polyclonal antibody to olfactory marker protein
(dilution, 1:100) (Abcam).
For Western blot analysis, OM cells were placed in lysis
buffer, and proteins were separated in 12% sodium dodecyl
sulfate − polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.16 Membranes
were probed with antibodies to anti–glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate dehydrogenase (dilution, 1:5000) (Sigma-
Aldrich) and βIII-tubulin (dilution, 1:1000) (Chemicon), fol-
lowed by appropriate secondary antibodies and revealed by
chemiluminescence (Amersham, ECL; GE Healthcare).
RT-QuIC Analysis
Recombinant PrP substrates (see below) were prepared as pre-
viously described.20 We performed RT-QuIC assays as re-
ported previously for CSF9 and OM16 except where indicated.
For CSF analysis, reactions were run as previously described
with hamster recombinant PrPSen 23-231 (PQ-CSF) or 90-231
(IQ-CSF). Twenty microliters of undiluted CSF was used per
reaction well at RML and UV and 15 or 30 μL of undiluted CSF
at ISS. For PQ-CSF, positive and negative assessments were
made at the 90-hour point. For IQ-CSF, positive and negative
results were scored based on the highest peak value before 50
hours to account for the signal degradation over time at higher
temperatures.
Olfactory mucosa analyses at RML and UV were per-
formed as described,16 whereas at ISS, plates were incubated
in a plate reader (FLUOstar Omega; BMG LABTECH) at 42°C
for 70 to 90 hours with cycles of 90 seconds of shaking (900
rpm, double-orbital) and 30 seconds of rest throughout the in-
cubation. Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence measurements
(mean [SD] excitation, 450 [10] nm; mean emission, 480 [10]
nm [bottom read]) were taken every 45 minutes at RML and
UV and every 15 minutes at ISS.
Sample findings were judged to be RT-QuIC positive using
criteriasimilartothosepreviouslydescribedforRT-QuICanaly-
ses of OM and CSF specimens13,16 using baseline-adjusted fluo-
rescence values normalized to the maximum ThT fluores-
cenceoftheplatereaders(260 000relativefluorescenceunits)
and suitably adjusted cutoff values.16 For OM sampling, we
used a cutoff of 50 (RML and UV) or 70 (ISS) hours.
Results
Patients
At the time of CSF or OM sampling, the 86 patients (37 men
[43%] and 49 women [57%]; mean [SD] age, 65.7 [11.5] years)
referred to the CJD surveillance system were classified as hav-
ing probable (n = 51), possible (n = 24), or suspected (ie, not
fully meeting the CJD diagnostic criteria) (n = 11) CJD. These
patients were followed up until death or until an alternative
diagnosis became available, when they were reclassified ac-
cording to the internationally recognized diagnostic criteria
without taking into account the results of the RT-QuIC test. Fi-
nal diagnosis among these patients yielded 69 patients with
CJD classified as definite CJD (n = 30), probable CJD (n = 31),
or genetic prion disease (n = 8) (Table 1 and eTables 1-3 in the
Supplement). Seventeen patients were reclassified as having
non-CJD (Table 1 and eTable 3 in the Supplement).
CSF Analyses Using PQ- and IQ-CSF Conditions
in Patients With Prion Diseases
We tested CSF samples using the PQ- and/or the IQ-CSF as-
says (Table 2). Results of PQ-CSF testing were positive for 36
of 49 patients with definite or probable CJD for 73% (95% CI,
59%-85%) diagnostic sensitivity. Results of IQ-CSF were posi-
tive for 19 of 22 patients with definite or probable CJD for 86%
(95% CI, 62%-96%) diagnostic sensitivity; however, we note
that 13 of the 21 IQ-CSF samples were selected because they
previously had negative PQ-CSF findings, thus biasing this pa-
tientgrouptowardthosewithlowerseedingactivityintheCSF.
Overall, CSF RT-QuIC assays were positive in 54 of 57 patients
with sporadic CJD, with an overall sensitivity of 95% (95% CI,
84%-99%).ThreepatientswithdefinitesporadicCJDhadnega-
tive RT-QuIC findings of both CSF tests (Table 2). Six of 8 pa-
tientswithgeneticpriondiseasehadpositiveCSFRT-QuICfind-
ings (sensitivity, 75%; 95% CI, 36%-96%) (Table 2). One patient
with genetic CJD (V180I) and 1 patient with Gerstmann-
Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome continued to have negative
findings. All non–prion disease control CSF samples, includ-
ing those originally with suspected prion disease (n = 71), had
negative findings for a specificity of 100% (95% CI, 94%-
100%) (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Our findings confirm that
IQ-CSF RT-QuIC is the more sensitive RT-QuIC protocol for
analysis of CSF from patients with sporadic CJD.
RT-QuIC Results Using OM Samples Taken by Flocked Swab
or Brushes
We also tested OM samples and compared the RT-QuIC re-
sults from OM sampling using flocked swabs and cyto-
brushes (Figure 1A and B). Flocked swabs significantly re-
duced discomfort for the patients during the sampling
procedure by decreasing abrasions of the nasal mucosa com-
pared with the cytobrush. Swabs and brushes collected simi-
lar numbers of olfactory neurons as judged by microscopy and
Western blot analysis (eFigure, C-H in the Supplement). Red
blood cells were more frequently observed in OM samples col-
lected with brushes than swabs (eFigure, A, B, E, and F in the
Supplement).
The relative efficiencies of OM sampling with swabs and
brushes were evaluated for the 86 patients referred to the sur-
veillance system (Table 1 and eTables 2 and 3 in the Supple-
ment), 27 patients with other neurologic disorders, and 23 in-
dividuals without neurologic disorders (eTables 2 and 3 in the
Supplement). The data for cytobrush samples from controls
with other neurologic disorders and without neurologic dis-
ordershavebeenpreviouslyreported16andareincludedherein
for comparison with the newer swab data.
Mean data from the swab and cytobrush samples show
close overlap of the RT-QuIC fluorescence traces (Figure 1C),
suggesting that the level of seeding activity in these samples
was comparable using the 2 distinct tools. Analysis of the
peak mean ThT fluorescence readings within 50 hours for
each patient undergoing sampling with swabs and a cyto-
brush (n = 30) showed similar ThT maximum levels and

77%-97%) using the cytobrush (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
In 4 patients, no seeding activity was detected in at least 1 of
the OM samples but was detected in another sample from
the same patient, indicating that multiple sample collections
from an individual patient can improve the chance of detec-
tion. Patients 37 and 41 had negative RT-QuIC findings for all
3 of their OM samplings (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
In patient 41, 1 of the 2 patients with CJD and a false-
negative OM test result, the procedure was compromised by
severe deviation of the nasal septum (eTable 2 in the Supple-
ment). When RT-QuIC data from the OM or the CSF speci-
mens or both were considered, all 61 patients with definite and
probable sporadic CJD had positive findings, giving an over-
all diagnostic sensitivity of 100% (95% CI, 93%-100%) (eTable
2 in the Supplement). Furthermore, all OM samples from the
17 non–prion disease controls had negative RT-QuIC findings,
resulting in a diagnostic specificity of 100% (95% CI, 91%-
100%).
Comparison of Accuracy of RT-QuIC With the Combination
of Other In Vivo Diagnostic Criteria
In this study, the initial diagnosis was formulated without con-
sidering the RT-QuIC results. However, when a retrospective
follow-up of the patients was performed using the current di-
agnostic criteria paired with the RT-QuIC results, the accu-
racy of the diagnosis for patients with sporadic CJD dramati-
cally improved (Table 2). In particular, of the 51 patients who
were classified as having probable CJD (sporadic or genetic) at
the time of sampling, 50 (98%) had positive RT-QuIC find-
ings. When the final diagnosis was determined for these pa-
tients,46haddefiniteorprobablesporadicCJD,revealing100%
RT-QuIC accuracy for sporadic CJD. Four of the patients ini-
tially classified with probable CJD and who had positive
RT-QuIC findings were classified with genetic CJD, again giv-
ing 100% accuracy. One patient was initially classified with
probable CJD but finally diagnosed with non-CJD with nega-
tive RT-QuIC findings.
Of the 24 patients initially diagnosed with possible CJD
(Table 2) at the time of sampling, 16 (67%) had positive RT-
QuIC findings. Their final diagnosis showed that 15 of these 24
patients (63%) had definite or probable sporadic CJD, again
demonstrating 100% RT-QuIC accuracy for sporadic CJD.
Within this group, 2 patients were finally classified with ge-
netic CJD; one had positive (E200K) and the other had nega-
tive (V180I) RT-QuIC findings. Seven of 24 patients (29%) were
finally classified with non-CJD and none had positive RT-
QuIC findings.
Of the 11 patients who were classified with only sus-

RT-QuIC testing can markedly improve the accuracy of CJD di-
agnosis, especially in cases designated by other criteria as hav-
ing only possible or suspected CJD.
Discussion
Our data from a large cohort of patients with suspected CJD
reveal that combined results of RT-QuIC assays on CSF and OM
samples allow antemortem diagnosis of sporadic CJD with
100% specificity and sensitivity. The sensitivity of RT-QuIC in
detecting cases of genetic prion disease was lower than that
in detecting sporadic CJD. The small number of patients with
genetic forms of prion disease undergoing testing in this study
does not allow for any conclusions about relative sensitivi-
ties, but genetic CJD cases would ordinarily be identified by
results of genetic testing for mutations in the prion protein
(PRNP gene [GenBank U29185]). Also, we did not test any
samples from patients with variant CJD, but clinical cases of
this category of CJD have almost disappeared.
Our results suggest that the application of RT-QuIC test-
ing will improve the accuracy and speed of sporadic CJD di-
agnosis compared with internationally recognized antemor-
tem diagnostic criteria.1,2 For patients with rapidly evolving
dementia, routine CSF analyses should include the IQ-CSF
analysis to confirm or exclude prion diseases.21 Because RT-
QuIC analysis of CSF is not 100% sensitive (Table 2 and eTable
2 in the Supplement),9 we suggest RT-QuIC testing of OM in
all patients in whom CJD is still suspected after a negative CSF
result (Figure 2). Cerebrospinal fluid samples are routinely col-
lected in patients with rapidly progressive dementias to ex-
clude potentially treatable diseases22,23; therefore, CSF is usu-
ally the primary tissue for initial RT-QuIC analysis. A positive
RT-QuIC finding in the CSF of patients with progressive neu-
rologic signs should be sufficient to establish a diagnosis of
probable CJD21 and would make OM sampling unnecessary.
However, when the RT-QuIC CSF finding is negative or lum-
bar puncture is not feasible (eTable 2 in the Supplement),24 OM
sampling would become necessary to confirm prion disease
ortodiverttoalternativediagnoses(Figure2).Onepatientwho
was diagnosed as having probable sporadic CJD at the time of
referral but had negative RT-QuIC findings using CSF and OM
samples was finally diagnosed with encephalitis rather than
prion disease.
Patients5and9,whohadtheMV/2PrPCJDglycotypeofspo-
radic CJD (eTable 2 in the Supplement), had negative CSF RT-
QuIC findings using both PQ-CSF and IQ-CSF conditions,
whereas OM testing had positive findings. This result sug-
gests that in the sporadic CJD MV/2 PrPCJD glycotype, where
the diagnostic sensitivity of supportive investigations is rela-
tively low, OM brushing may be the only premortem diagnos-
tic test with positive findings.3,6
Olfactory mucosa sampling is a simple procedure and can
be performed without special training by otolaryngologists
guided by a tutorial video. Our comparison of 2 OM sample col-
lection tools shows that the efficacy of the gentle and soft na-
sal swab is comparable to that of the previously used cyto-
brush. A few samples from patients with sporadic CJD had
negative RT-QuIC findings, which suggests that the collec-
tion of OM from the walls of the superior nasal cavity was not
always successful. Consequently, our findings indicate that
multiple OM samplings improve diagnostic sensitivity.
For patients 41 and 37, who had sporadic CJD, the OM RT-
QuICfindingswerenegative.Patient41(eTable2intheSupple-
ment) had anatomical abnormalities that likely impeded effi-
cientOMsampling.Patient37(eTable2intheSupplement)had
a diagnosis of probable CJD and died after a long disease course
of 30 months with no autopsy (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
The reason that these patients have negative OM RT-QuIC find-
ings and positive CSF findings is not yet clear. However, these
cases indicate that in a small subset of patients with CJD, prion
seeding activity might not be detectable in nasal samples be-
cause prion seeding activity in the OM does not always reach
detectable levels, or sampling is impeded by anatomical ab-
normalities, such as a deviated septum, or due to inflamma-
tory conditions, such as rhinitis or nasal polyposis. Alterna-
tively, in a very few cases, the repeated collection of the OM
may occur in an area of the olfactory neuroepithelium with-
out PrPCJD. This possibility would confirm the uneven distri-
bution of PrPCJD in the layers of the olfactory mucosa.25 The
reduced RT-QuIC sensitivity observed in cases with genetic
prion disease might be explained by differences in prion tis-
sue distribution in these patients or by different prion
conformations.26
Finally, the fiberscopes used in this study can be safely
reused because the fiberscope was always covered by a dis-
posable sheath and inserted into the lower turbinate of the
nose without touching the OM. Furthermore, no infectivity
has yet been detected in nasal secretions or saliva of patients
with CJD,27 and PrPCJD is not detectable in respiratory
mucosa.25
Limitations

a Because the olfactory mucosa RT-QuIC assay is performed on central nervous
system tissue, a positive finding might allow a definite diagnosis of CJD
according to the World Health Organization diagnostic criteria

whether RT-QuIC in the CSF or in the OM is able to detect prion
seeding activity during the preclinical stage of disease.
Conclusions
We propose a diagnostic algorithm (Figure 2) for patients with
clinically suspected sporadic CJD, which starts with RT-QuIC
IQ-CSF analysis and, if the findings are negative, is followed
by OM analysis. According to our results to date, this diagnos-
tic flow provides a sensitivity and specificity of virtually 100%.
BecauseRT-QuICtestingisnowavailableinmostwesterncoun-
tries, Japan, and Australia,28 the inclusion of this procedure
inclinicalpracticeseemsfeasible.InItaly,themeancostranges
from the equivalent of US $100 to $200, and results are avail-
able in about 3 days for CSF tests and in a single day for OM
tests.9,16,29 The combination of RT-QuIC and genetic testing
would quickly confirm or dismiss the diagnosis of virtually all
patientswithclinicallysuspectedhumanpriondiseases.Inour
study,17of86patients(20%)withpotentialCJDwerepromptly
diverted to alternative diagnoses of non-CJD, and 5 of them
receivedsuccessfultreatment(Tables1and2andeTables2and
3 in the Supplement). Such accurate discrimination of prion
diseases from other neurodegenerative illnesses or treatable
dementias will also improve the reliability of patient selec-
tion in any future therapeutic trials.30,31
