In Brief
Using a humanized mouse model,
Abdulreda et al. show that, following
initial improvement in human pancreatic
function, prolonged daily liraglutide
treatment for over 200 days is associated
with compromised insulin release and
dysregulated glucose homeostasis,
indicating islet cell metabolic exhaustion.

SUMMARY
Incretin mimetics are frequently used in the treat-
ment of type 2 diabetes because they potentiate b
cell response to glucose. Clinical evidence showing
short-term benefits of such therapeutics (e.g., lira-
glutide) is abundant; however, there have been
several recent reports of unexpected complications
in association with incretin mimetic therapy. Impor-
tantly, clinical evidence on the potential effects of
such agents on the b cell and islet function during
long-term, multiyear use remains lacking. We now
show that prolonged daily liraglutide treatment of
>200 days in humanized mice, transplanted with hu-
man pancreatic islets in the anterior chamber of the
eye, is associated with compromised release of hu-
man insulin and deranged overall glucose homeosta-
sis. These findings raise concern about the chronic
potentiation of b cell function through incretin
mimetic therapy in diabetes.
INTRODUCTION
Incretin mimetics, or glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs,
are a relatively new family of antidiabetic agents. Several GLP-
1 analogs are currently used, and more are being developed
for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) (Saulsberry et al.,
2015; Tella and Rendell, 2015). GLP-1 is an incretin, a polypep-
tide secreted by intestinal L cells in response to food ingestion.
Incretins contribute to glucose homeostasis by stimulating insu-
lin secretion from pancreatic b cells, suppressing prandial
glucagon secretion from a cells, reducing gastric emptying and
intestinal absorption, and promoting satiety. GLP-1 is also
rapidly inactivated by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4). While
the GLP-1 analog liraglutide shares 97% homology to human
GLP-1, it is, however, less susceptible to degradation by DPP-
4, and hence, its effects last longer. This has led to the use of
GLP-1 analogs, such as liraglutide, as long-acting incretin mi-
metics to improve glycemic control in T2D patients. Although lir-
aglutide has longer activity compared to GLP-1, its half-life is still
limited, thus requiring daily injections (Buse et al., 2009, 2010).
While extended-release formulations of GLP-1 analogs (e.g., du-
laglutide) have been developed to allow once-weekly adminis-
tration, these and other antidiabetic agents (e.g., sitagliptin and
metformin) have demonstrated less-impressive reductions in
glycated hemoglobin (A1C) and BMI for T2D patients than lira-
glutide (Chitnis et al., 2014; Dungan et al., 2014; Lee et al.,
2014; Trujillo and Nuffer, 2014).
Available clinical data show the short-term benefits of therapy
with incretin mimetics (e.g., liraglutide) in diabetes and other
conditions typically during the first few years of use (Davies
et al., 2015; Inoue et al., 2014; Katout et al., 2014; Mateos and
Wajchenberg, 2012). However, preclinical and clinical data on
the potential impact of such therapeutics on the human b cell af-
ter continuous, multiyear use are currently lacking (Consoli and
Di Biagio, 2011; Devaraj and Maitra, 2014; Inoue et al., 2014;
Wajchenberg, 2007). Notably, reports on undesired side effects
and potentially life-threatening complications in association with
the use of GLP-1 analogs have been emerging, and concerns
about these effects after long-term use of such agents are
increasingly being expressed (Prescrire Int., 2015). Gastrointes-
tinal adverse effects are frequently reported with incretin mimetic
therapy, and there have been several reports on increased risk of
pancreatitis and pancreatic or neuroendocrine tumors with these
therapies (Butler et al., 2013; Chalmer et al., 2015; Consoli and
Formoso, 2015; Devaraj and Maitra, 2014).
Although incretin mimetics have been used in the clinic for
more than a decade, a conclusive review of their potential effects
on the human islet during long-term, continuous use has been
difficult due to inconsistencies in treatment duration and report-
ing biases in clinical trials (Butler et al., 2013; Consoli and For-
moso, 2015; Devaraj and Maitra, 2014). Additionally, it is neither
feasible to exert varied yet well-controlled experimental condi-
tions nor ethical to manipulate treatment conditions in human
subjects to investigate this outstanding question in the mean-
time. Liraglutide’s beneficial effects on pancreatic b cells were
initially demonstrated by pioneering studies using mice (Bock
et al., 2003; Larsen et al., 2001; Sturis et al., 2003). Liraglutide
was reported to reduce hyperglycemia in T2D mouse models
by increasing pancreatic b cell mass through enhanced prolifer-
ation (Rolin et al., 2002). While rodent islets have been and are
likely to remain the workhorses of research in islet biology,
increasing evidence showing distinct structural and functional
features of the rodent and human islets underscores the need
for conducting studies with primary human islets (Cabrera

 et al., 2006; Rodriguez-Diaz et al., 2011). This may also help in
mitigating the common inconsistencies between preclinical find-
ings and clinical outcomes. We therefore employed a ‘‘human-
ized’’ mouse model generated by transplanting human islets
into the anterior chamber of the eye of diabetic nude mice.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Although direct extrapolation from rodents to humans is not
straightforward, the technical and ethical limitations associated
with research in human subjects have historically motivated
the use of animal models, and mice have been at the forefront
of this effort (Budhu et al., 2014; Peters et al., 2007; Rosenthal
and Brown, 2007). Importantly, mice engrafted with human tis-
sue, also known as humanized mice, hold great promise in
improving our understanding of human diseases (Ito et al.,
2012; Rahmig et al., 2015). Mice have also been used to study
natural processes such as aging (Demetrius, 2006; Vanhooren
and Libert, 2013). Our recent findings have shown that aged
mice have pancreatic islets with hallmarks consistent with hu-
man islets from aged individuals (Almac
¸ a et al., 2014). This
further supported the notion that the human islets in our mouse
model are likely to be exposed to a systemic aging process dur-
ing a prolonged liraglutide treatment of R250 days as in situ
islets in the human pancreas during long-term, multiyear use of
incretin mimetic therapy (Flurkey et al., 2007; Jucker et al., 1994).
In the current study, we transplanted a marginal mass of hu-
man islets to accelerate human b cell exhaustion and overall
changes in glucose homeostasis. We adapted our intraocular
islet transplantation model (Abdulreda et al., 2013; Speier
et al., 2008a) and transplanted 500 human islet equivalents into
each eye (Caicedo et al., 2009; R. Rodriguez et al., 2009, Am.
J. Transplant., abstract) (Figures 1A and 1B). This is significantly
less than what is typically transplanted into the kidney subcapsu-
lar space of mice to restore and maintain normoglycemia (Fig-
ures S1A and S1B, available online) (Ichii et al., 2005). Therefore,
we were able to properly randomize the animals in our studies by
matching the liraglutide- and saline-treated recipients to the
same human islet preparation and further circumvent the
experimental variability associated with different human islet
preparations from different donors. Although mice transplanted
with human pancreatic islets under the kidney subcapsular
space or other ectopic sites have been used more widely than
those transplanted with islets in the anterior chamber of the
eye, it has also been shown in our personal experience that dia-
betic nude mice transplanted with up to 2,000 human islet equiv-
alents (IEQs) under the kidney capsule tend to lose function
within 2–3 months after transplantation (Ichii et al., 2005). Conse-
quently, our studies requiring extended follow-up well beyond
3 months would not have been possible in mice transplanted un-
der the kidney capsule. By contrast, the intraocular islet trans-
plantation model allowed us to gain insight about the potential

 effects of prolonged use of liraglutide on the human islet function
during the R250 days of continuous treatment. Moreover, intra-
ocular transplantation allowed longitudinal and noninvasive
monitoring of the human islets, as previously described for
mouse and monkey islets (Abdulreda and Berggren, 2013; Ab-
dulreda et al., 2011; Perez et al., 2011; Speier et al., 2008a).
In our humanized mouse model, intraocular human islet grafts
restored normoglycemia in the recipient diabetic nude mice (Fig-
ure 1). The human islets maintained typical cytoarchitecture and
cellular composition R250 days post-transplant (Figures 1A–1C)
(Cabrera et al., 2006). Consistent with previous findings in rodent
islets (Toyoda et al., 2008), the results showed improved initial
function of the transplanted human islets in liraglutide-treated
(300 mg/kg/day subcutaneously [s.c.]) mice compared to
matched saline-treated controls (Figures 1C and 1D) (Merani
et al., 2008). The mice tolerated well the liraglutide treatment
and exhibited no adverse systemic side effects. However,
long-term follow up in the same mice for R200 days after initi-
ating the liraglutide treatment showed no additional improve-
ment in function of the human islets. Instead, the results showed
unexpected progressive deterioration in glycemic control in the
mice following long-term, continuous treatment with liraglutide
(Figures 2A, 2B, and S2). This effect was also observed during
high glucose challenges performed throughout the long-term

Longitudinal in vivo follow up in humanized mice revealed compromised glycemic control in association with long-term, daily treatment with liraglutide.

binned for each treatment group for the indicated time points on the x axis. Green lines represent the geometric mean (asterisks indicate significance; p = 0.045 for
[90–120], p = 0.724 for [130–160], p = 0.00012 for [170–200]).
(B) Kaplan-Meyer curves showing a comprehensive record of percent normoglycemic animals during the extended follow up of R250 days after treatment
initiation (n = 17–18 mice/treatment). Liraglutide-driven improvement in human islet function was initially evident based on the higher number of normoglycemic
mice during the first �80 days after treatment initiation (day 0). However, islet function started to deteriorate in the liraglutide-treated mice at �150 days of
treatment, as evidenced by the lower percent of normoglycemic mice. The overall median ‘‘survival’’ (i.e., normoglycemia) time did not differ significantly between
the liraglutide- versus saline-treated mice (107 versus 132, respectively; p = 0.4861).

showed the progressive deterioration of glycemic control by the human islets in the challenged mice (n = 6–7 mice/treatment; data shown as mean ± SEM).

 liraglutide treatment (Figures 2C–2F). Human C-peptide plasma
levels were lower, albeit not significantly, in fed mice after
168 days of liraglutide treatment compared to saline (Figure 2F;
p = 0.073). Importantly, insulin plasma levels during high glucose
challenges performed after R175 days of treatment indicated
slower kinetics of insulin release from the human islets in the lir-
aglutide-treated recipients (Figure 2E). Insulin levels peaked at
3 min after glucose bolus in saline-treated mice, whereas more
gradual increase was observed in those treated with liraglutide.
Additional results from an insulin-tolerance test performed
>240 days of liraglutide treatment did not show decreased pe-
ripheral insulin sensitivity in the liraglutide-treated recipients
compared to saline-treated counterparts (Figure 2G). Both lira-
glutide- and saline-treated mice maintained similar body weights
during the extended follow-up (Figure S1B). These results sup-
port the notion that long-term treatment with liraglutide is asso-
ciated with compromised hormone release from the human b cell
in our model. It has been reported that secretory dysfunction and
b cell apoptosis in the pancreas may occur under oxidative
stress and inflammatory conditions (Kim and Yoon, 2011;
Nguyen et al., 2015; Talukdar et al., 2015). In addition, apoptosis
may have been increased by direct cytotoxic effects of liraglutide
on b cells by the dose applied in our studies (300 mg/kg/day).
Although consistent with what is commonly used in rodents
(Bock et al., 2003; Merani et al., 2008; Rolin et al., 2002), this
dose is approximately seven times higher than that currently rec-
ommended in diabetic patients (Rigato et al., 2015). However,
this is unlikely because our immunostaining data showed rela-
tively intact human islets at the conclusion of the studies (Fig-
ure 1B). Therefore, we conclude that, rather than apoptosis or
compromised insulin biogenesis, continuous liraglutide treat-
ment for R250 days primarily induced deranged insulin release
in the human islets in our mouse model.
Although the results did not show increased peripheral insulin
resistance after exposure to liraglutide for R250 days, we cannot
rule out this possibility early in the treatment in our model. Liraglu-
tide-treated mice may have initially experienced decreased pe-
ripheral insulin sensitivity due to increased human b cell output
and hyperinsulinemia driven by liraglutide and/or augmented
priming effects by the increased combined a cell mass in the
transplanted islets (Figure 1B) and in the pancreas (Figure S1C)
(Rodriguez-Diaz et al., 2011). Nonetheless, the current results
indicate that the observed derangement in glucose homeostasis
in our model cannot be solely explained by changes in peripheral
insulin sensitivity or body mass. Future studies are needed to fully
characterize the mechanism(s) underlying the potential effects of
long-term liraglutide treatment on the human b cell.
In summary, we show that chronic activation of human islets
by prolonged daily liraglutide treatment in a humanized mouse
model is associated with initial improvement in function that is
followed by progressive deterioration over time. These findings
are consistent with the notion that ‘‘excessive’’ activation of an
already-overworked b cell under diabetic conditions during
long-term treatment with incretin mimetics may lead to meta-
bolic exhaustion of the b cell (Araki et al., 2003; Larque
´ et al.,
2011) and, ultimately, compromised glucose homeostasis. This
is conceptually important to consider prior to prescribing long-
term, multiyear, continuous usage of GLP-1 analogs for the
treatment of T2D.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals and Drugs
Animal procedures were performed under protocols approved by the Univer-
sity of Miami IACUC. Athymic nude mice (Nu/Nu; JAX stock #002019) were
purchased from Jackson Laboratory (JAX). Animals were housed in virus-
antibody-free (VAF) rooms and kept in microisolated cages with free access
to autoclaved food and water. Liraglutide was purchased as synthetic trifluor-
oacetate salt from Bachem, Switzerland. A 10003 stock solution was pre-
pared by dissolving 18 mg in 1 ml of sterile normal saline solution (0.9% sodium
chloride), divided in single-use aliquots, and stored at –20�C.
Diabetes Induction
Acute diabetes induction in the mice was achieved via single intravenous or
intraperitoneal injection of Streptozotocin (STZ; 150–220 mg/kg). The mice
were fasted overnight (�17 hr) before STZ administration in order to measure
and compare fasting glycemia before and after development of STZ-induced
diabetes. When needed, up to two additional doses of STZ were administered
at least 3 days apart to confirm frank diabetes (three consecutive readings of
nonfasting glycemia R300 mg/dL).
Human Islets and Islet Transplantation into the Eye
Human pancreatic islets were obtained through the City of Hope Integrated
Islet Distribution Program (IIDP). Islets were incubated at 22�C in serum-free
Miami media supplemented with glutathione (1 mg/100 ml) (Bottino et al.,
1997). Islets destined for transplantation into liraglutide-treated diabetic recip-
ients were cultured for 48 hr in Miami media supplemented with liraglutide
(0.1 nM) (Bohman et al., 2007). Recipient treatment with either liraglutide
(300 mg/kg/day s.c.) (Merani et al., 2008) or saline was also started 2 days prior
to transplantation. The rationale for pretreatment was to establish baseline
drug levels in the recipient mice before transplantation. Islet transplantation
into the anterior chamber of the eye of diabetic nude mice was performed
as previously described (Abdulreda et al., 2013; Speier et al., 2008a; Speier
et al., 2008b). A total of 1,000 IEQs (500 IEQs in each eye) were transplanted
into confirmed hyperglycemic nude mouse recipients.
Glycemia, Body-Weight Monitoring, Blood Sampling, and
Enucleation
Animals were weighed two to three times per week, and blood glucose was
measured using portable glucometers (OneTouchUltra2). Blood samples
(�100 mL) for hormone measurements during glucose challenge were
collected from the tail vein into tubes containing K2 EDTA and immediately
supplemented with 5 ml aprotinin (10,000 KIU/ml). Given the time constraints
of bleeding mice through the tail vein, glycemia was not measured during these
challenges, which were conducted specifically for the purpose of hormone
measurements. Plasma insulin levels were measured with human insulin
ELISA (Mercodia, 10-1113-01, normal range). C-peptide levels were measured
with human C-Peptide ELISA (Mercodia, 10-1136-01). Enucleation (i.e.,
removal of eyes bearing the islet graft) was approved by the University of
Miami IACUC and was performed under general anesthesia. The eyes were
carefully resected, and the orbit was packed with sterile gauze saturated
with neomycin ointment to prevent bleeding. Glycemia during the first 20–
30 min was measured while the mouse was still under anesthesia and without
thereafter. The mice were euthanized immediately after the last glycemia
measurement.
IPGTT and ITT
Intraperitoneal glucose-tolerance tests (IPGTTs) were performed after over-
night fasting. Mice were injected with 200–300 ml glucose solution (4 g/kg
body weight [B.W.]) and blood glucose (IPGTT) or insulin (ITT) was monitored
at predetermined time points after the injection. The higher-concentration
glucose bolus was used to elicit glucose excursion during challenges with
glucose or insulin, as the typical 2 g/kg B.W. bolus did not induce measurable
change in glycemia in nude mice transplanted with human islets. In our hands,
mice transplanted with human islets typically maintained fed glycemia around
%100 mg/dl and returned to fasting glycemia levels within 60 min during
IPGTTs. Given the tight glucose regulation by the human islet grafts, trans-
planted mice were not fasted prior to ITT to avoid severe hypoglycemia.

 Immunofluorescence Staining
Frozen/fixed mouse eyes bearing human islet grafts and recipient mouse pan-
creata were thawed at 4�C and transferred into Sakura cassettes, and fixation
process was repeated with 10% formalin buffered solution for 6 hr at room
temperature (RT). Dehydration of eye tissue was performed in a VIP3000, after
which eyes were embedded into paraffin and sectioned (4 mm) for immunoflu-
orescence staining. Used antibodies included guinea pig anti-insulin (Dako,
diluted 1:35), rabbit anti-glucagon (Dako, diluted 1:50), and rabbit anti-Ki67
(Ventana).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using Graphpad Prism. All data were ex-
pressed as means ± SD (unless otherwise stated). Parametric (paired/unpaired
t test) and nonparametric tests (Mann-Whitney test and Wilcoxon test) were
used to perform pairwise comparisons. Multiple comparisons were by ordinary
one-way ANOVA, followed by either the parametric Holm-Sidak’s multiple-
comparisons test or the nonparametric Dunn’s or Kruskal-Wallis multiple-
comparisons tests. Comparison of median diabetes reversal or survival times
in Kaplan-Meier curves was done using the log rank (Mantel-Cox) test. Aster-
isks denote significance with p < 0.05.
