The risk of schizophrenia is increased in offspring whose mothers experience malnutrition during pregnancy. Polyunsaturated fatty
acids (PUFAs) are dietary components that are crucial for the structural and functional integrity of neural cells, and PUFA deficiency
has been shown to be a risk factor for schizophrenia. Here, we show that gestational and early postnatal dietary deprivation of two
PUFAs—arachidonic acid (AA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)—elicited schizophrenia-like phenotypes in mouse offspring at
adulthood. In the PUFA-deprived mouse group, we observed lower motivation and higher sensitivity to a hallucinogenic drug
resembling the prodromal symptoms in schizophrenia. Furthermore, a working-memory task-evoked hyper-neuronal activity in
the medial prefrontal cortex was also observed, along with the downregulation of genes in the prefrontal cortex involved in
oligodendrocyte integrity and the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic system. Regulation of these genes was mediated by the
nuclear receptor genes Rxr and Ppar, whose promoters were hyper-methylated by the deprivation of dietary AA and DHA. In
addition, the RXR agonist bexarotene upregulated oligodendrocyte- and GABA-related gene expression and suppressed the
sensitivity of mice to the hallucinogenic drug. Notably, the expression of these nuclear receptor genes were also downregulated in
hair-follicle cells from schizophrenia patients. These results suggest that PUFA deficiency during the early neurodevelopmental
period in mice could model the prodromal state of schizophrenia through changes in the epigenetic regulation of nuclear
receptor genes.

INTRODUCTION
Among the well-established risk factors for schizophrenia that
affect early neurodevelopment, nutritional deficiencies are known
to have significant effects.1 For example, epidemiological evidence
indicates that exposure to famine in early gestation approximately
doubles the risk of schizophrenia in offspring, as observed after
the Dutch Hunger Winter (1944–1945)2 and the Great Chinese
Famine (1959–1961).3,4 Thus, the adverse conditions during
gestation may have lasting effects on subsequent health or result
in adult-onset diseases due to fetal programming, which is
commonly referred to as the Developmental Origin of Health and
Disease (DOHaD).5,6 The DOHaD theory has been found to apply
to many syndromes and disorders, including schizophrenia.2 In
addition, long-lasting epigenetic changes are evident in the
offspring of women who experience famine during the first
trimester of pregnancy, but are absent in those who either do not
experience famine or who experience it at a later gestational
period.7 Therefore, the diet of pregnant mothers, especially during
early developmental stages, influences epigenetic changes in the
fetus, such as DNA methylation, thereby affecting the expression
of developmentally regulated genes.8
Deficiencies of several nutrients including folic acids, essential
fatty acids, retinoids, vitamin D and iron have been attributed for
the schizophrenia risk resulting from gestational famine.1 Among
the nutrients, the major polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs)
arachidonic acid (AA) (20:4 n − 6) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)
(22:6 n − 3) have a critical role in brain development.9 DHA and AA
are key components of membrane phospholipids, contributing to
the structural integrity of neurons, glial cells and endothelial cells
in the brain,10 and they also affect neurotransmission, cell survival
and neuroinflammation.10 Evidence has begun to suggest links
between prenatal DHA deficiency and abnormal neurotransmis-
sion and neurocognitive impairments.11,12
Considering the essential role of PUFA, we hypothesized that
the compromised availability of dietary PUFA may affect early
neurodevelopment and thereby predispose to the development

 of schizophrenia. Therefore, in this study, we sought to determine
whether deprivation of the essential fatty acids AA and DHA
during early development (gestational and early postnatal) in mice
elicits schizophrenia-like phenotypes in the adult offspring. After
confirming this phenomenon, we strove to identify its underlying
signaling cascades. Our results identified the RXR and PPAR
nuclear receptor signaling system as an upstream mechanism that
leads PUFA deficiency to result in schizophrenia-like phenotypes.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to show that
epigenetic modification of nuclear receptor genes has a key role in
the prodromal state of schizophrenia, as mediated by PUFA
deficiency during early neurodevelopmental stages.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and diets
Inbred
C57BL/6NCrlj
(B6)
mice
were
obtained
from
Charles
River
Laboratories (Tokyo, Japan). Housing conditions have been described
elsewhere.13 Experimental procedures were approved by the RIKEN Animal
Ethics Committee. We raised parental mice on four different diets by
adding AA and/or DHA (or neither) in AIN-76 food that did not contain
either AA or DHA: (1) AA(+)/DHA(+), (2) AA(+)/DHA(− ), (3) AA( − )/DHA(+) and
(4) AA( − )/DHA( − ) (Supplementary Table 1). The diets were given from
2 weeks before mating until 3 weeks after pups were born (weaning point).
After weaning, mice were raised on a conventional diet (CRF-1) (Charles
River formula; purchased from Oriental Yeast, Tokyo, Japan). All food was
stored at 4 °C and shielded from light until use to prevent oxidation and
denaturation. Food was not treated with gamma rays or autoclaved. We
examined male mice except in the milk study.
Fatty acid analysis
The fatty acid composition of mother’s milk (at postnatal day 8) and
cortical tissues (at 3 week old and 6 month old) derived from offspring of
the four diet groups were examined. Total lipids were extracted according
to the method of Bligh and Dyer.14 Total phospholipid fractions were
separated by thin-layer chromatography. The content of each fatty acid
was expressed as the percentage area of total fatty acids. The protocols for
fatty acid analysis are described elsewhere15,16 and in the Supplementary
Methods.
Behavioral analysis
Behavior was assessed using the following tests: open-field test, tail-
suspension test, Y-maze test, prepulse inhibition (PPI) test, forced swim
test, light and dark box test, elevated plus-maze test, home cage activity
test and MK-801 sensitivity test at 2 to 6 month old. The protocols for
behavioral tests were as described elsewhere17 and in the Supplementary
Methods.
Manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging
Manganese (Mn)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) experi-
ments were performed to compare the task (working-memory) related
neural activities in mouse groups at 6 month old. The protocols were as
described elsewhere18 and are shown in the Supplementary Methods and
Supplementary Figure 1.
Gene expression analysis by cDNA microarray and quantitative
real-time-PCR
Total RNA was extracted (Isogen RNA extraction kit, Nippon Gene, Tokyo,
Japan) from the prefrontal cortexes (PFC) of AA(+)/DHA(+) and AA( − )/
DHA( − ) mice at 6 month old (n = 6 for each). GeneChip Mouse Genome 430
2.0 Arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) were used to profile the
transcriptome according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Data analysis
was performed using GeneSpring GX (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,
CA, USA). Functional annotation of differentially regulated genes was
performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (Qiagen, Venlo, the
Netherlands). Quantitative real-time (RT)-PCR analysis was as described
elsewhere.19
See
the
Supplementary
Methods
for
more
detailed
information.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed as described elsewhere20 (and in
the Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Table 2) to visualize
nuclear receptor expression in the PFC of mice at 6 month old, and co-
localization of nuclear receptors in oligodendrocyte or GABAergic neurons.
Biochemical analysis of gamma-aminobutyric acid
Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentration in the cortex at 6 month
old was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
analysis as described elsewhere21 and in the Supplementary Methods.
Scalp hair-follicle samples
Scalp hair-follicle analysis was done as described in our previous work19
and in the Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Table 3. This study
was approved by the Ethics Committees of RIKEN and all participating
institutes, and was conducted according to the principles expressed in the
Declaration of Helsinki. All control subjects and patients gave written,
informed consent to participate in the study after the study protocols and
objectives were explained.
Cell culture and in vitro assay for nuclear receptor agonist activity
OLP6 cells (RIKEN BioResource Center Cell Bank, Tsukuba, Japan) were
incubated in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 33 °C in the
proliferative stage. Then, they were incubated with 5% CO2 at 39 °C for
4 days to induce differentiation. KATO-III cells (Japanese Collection of
Research Bioresources Cell Bank, Osaka, Japan) were incubated in a
humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Bezafibrate (Ppar/PPAR
(peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) pan-agonist: Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA) and bexarotene (Rxr/RXR (retinoid X receptor) pan-agonist:
LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA, USA) were solubilized in DMSO (dimethyl
sulfoxide). Stock solutions at 10 mM were stored at −20 °C until use. Stock
solutions were added to cell culture medium to yield final working
concentrations of 0.1, 0.3 and 1 μM (bexarotene; OLP6), 5, 15 and 50 μM
(bezafibrate; OLP6), 3, 10 and 30 μM (bexarotene; KATO-III) and 15 and
150 μM (bezafibrate; KATO-III). See Supplementary Methods for detailed
information.
In vivo assay for nuclear receptor agonist
B6 mice were administered vehicle (water) or bexarotene—which can
penetrate
the
blood–brain
barrier22—at
either
30 mg kg − 1
or
100 mg kg − 1 once daily (p.o.) for 3 weeks (6–9 weeks of age). After the
bexarotene treatment, gene-expression analysis and an MK-801 sensitivity
test were performed.
DNA methylation analysis via bisulfite sequencing
We examined the methylation levels of individual CpG sites in the core
promoter regions of Rxra (300 bp interval from transcriptional start site)
and Ppara (280 bp interval from transcriptional start site), by bisulfite
sequencing analysis of cortical samples from the AA(+)/DHA(+) and AA(− )/
DHA( − ) groups at 6 month old. Bisulfite sequencing was performed as
described elsewhere.23 Primer sequences are listed in the Supplementary
Methods.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using Prism 5 (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA).
Differences in continuous variables were evaluated by unpaired t-test
(after confirmation of normal distribution), or one way ANOVA or repeated
measures ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s test or Mann–Whitney U test as a
post hoc test. Bivariate correlation analysis was performed using Spear-
man’s rank test. P-valueso0.05 were considered significant. The definition
of outlier is any data point more than 1.5 interquartile ranges (IQRs) below
the first quartile or above the third quartile.

 group, AA in the mother’s milk was reduced in the AA( − )/DHA( − )
and AA( − )/DHA(+) groups, and DHA was reduced in the AA( − )/
DHA( − ) and AA(+)/DHA( − ) groups (Supplementary Tables 4). These
changes were also observed at postnatal day 15 (data not shown).
In the 3-week-old cortex, ‘AA content-related indices’ [n −6 PUFA/
n − 3 PUFA ratio and AA/(n − 6 PUFA + n − 3 PUFA)] were changed
according to prediction after the supplementation or deletion
of AA in the diet (Supplementary Table 5 and also see
Supplementary Table 6). Similar predicted changes were seen in
the ‘DHA content-related indices’ [n − 3 PUFA/n − 6 PUFA ratio and
DHA/(n − 6 PUFA + n − 3 PUFA)] (Supplementary Tables 5). The
expected changes were also observed in the DHA/AA ratio
(Supplementary Tables 5) and these changes were absent in the
cortex at 6 month old (Supplementary Table 7).
To assess whether maternal AA and/or DHA restriction during
neurodevelopment
evokes
behavioral
changes
indicative
of
schizophrenia or its prodromal phenotypes in adult offspring,
we performed a battery of behavioral tests to evaluate motivation,
emotional states and working-memory functions, on mice born to
dams which consumed one of four different combinations of diets
containing AA and/or DHA during pregnancy and lactating
(Figure 1a).
Early psychosis and the prodromal phase of schizophrenia are
associated with lowered levels of motivation, depressive symp-
toms and impaired cognitive functions.24,25 Compared with the
AA(+)/DHA(+) group, the groups with AA or DHA deficiency showed
higher immobility in the tail-suspension test and performed more
slowly on Y-maze test, particularly with significantly poorer
performance during the ‘late-phase sessions’ (Figures 1b and c).
These behavioral changes suggest impairments in sustaining
motivation or propensity to depression (for both tests) and in
processing speed of cognitive task (for Y-maze test). Further,
locomotor activity in the open-field test (total distance, average
speed, and moving speed) was significantly lower in the AA(− )/
DHA( − ) and AA( − )/DHA(+) groups than in the AA(+)/DHA(+) group
(Figure 1d). Combined, these results highlight the hypo-motivated
behavior of the AA( − )/DHA( − ) and AA( − )/DHA(+) groups compared
to that of the AA(+)/DHA(+) group. No significant differences were
observed in the other behavioral tests (Supplementary Table 8).
Further testing showed that compared with the AA(+)/DHA(+)
group, the AA( − )/DHA( − ) group exhibited a hyper-locomotive
response to the hallucinogenic drug MK-801 (a NMDA receptor
antagonist) (Figure 1e), a result that is reminiscent of some
psychotic states in otherwise healthy people or the exacerbation
of schizophrenic symptoms after administration of NMDA receptor
antagonists.26,27 Because the AA(+)/DHA(+) and AA( − )/DHA( − )
groups showed the greatest differences, we focused subsequent
analyses on only their comparisons. Thus, we showed that dietary
PUFA deprivation during gestational and early postnatal period
results in reduced motivation and higher sensitivity to hallucino-
genic drug, mimicking behavioral phenotypes in schizophrenia (or
prodromal schizophrenia).
The AA( − )/DHA( − ) group exhibited hyper-neuronal activity upon
performing a working-memory task
We next asked whether the abnormal behavioral phenotypes
exhibited by the AA( − )/DHA( − ) group were associated with altered
neuronal activity in brain regions that have been linked to
schizophrenia, for example, PFC. We conducted a Mn-enhanced
MRI on mice, after performing Y-maze test, which evaluates
working-memory capability that is impaired in schizophrenia. The
AA( − )/DHA( − ) and AA( − )/DHA(+) groups performed slightly worse
(in speed) than the AA(+)/DHA(+) group on this test (Figure 1c). In
Mn-enhanced MRI, manganese is a contrast agent that enters
activated neurons through calcium channels and remains there.28
Thus, MR signals that represent recent neuronal activity can be used
to identify brain regions associated with specific tasks.18,29,30 To
precisely compare the neuronal activity among groups, we prepared
flat maps of each region’s activity by averaging individual regional
MR signals as in the previous study.18 The AA( − )/DHA( − ) group
exhibited higher Mn-enhanced MR signals in the medial prefrontal
cortex (mPFC) and the nucleus accumbens shell than the AA(+)/
DHA(+)group (Figure 2a and Supplementary Figure 1a). The mPFC
neurons have been reported to be involved in encoding working
memory through increasing firing frequency or synchronization, and
the glutamatergic neurons in the mPFC send projections to the
nucleus accumbens shell31,32 (Supplementary Figure 1b, relevant
neuronal circuits are explained in the legends). The current MRI
results suggest the existence of a compensatory mechanism for
decreased executive function in the mPFC caused by the AA( − )/
DHA( − ) diet, which is in agreement with reports of clinical cases of
schizophrenia.33–35 We also performed volumetric analyses using the
MRI data but detected no changes in the volume of the whole brain,
the lateral ventricles, and the hippocampus among the four different
diet groups (Supplementary Table 9).
Decreased expression levels of oligodendrocyte- and GABA-
related genes were observed in the prefrontal cortex of the AA( − )/
DHA( − )group
To characterize the transcriptomic changes that accompany the
gestational and early postnatal deprivation of dietary PUFA in
mice, we examined gene-expression levels in the PFC of the AA(+)/
DHA(+) and AA( − )/DHA( − )groups at 6 months of age, as dysfunc-
tion of the PFC is implicated in schizophrenia. Microarray analysis
revealed 174 significantly downregulated genes and 540 upregu-
lated genes (Po0.01, fold change 41.3) in the PFC of the AA( − )/
DHA( − ) group compared with the AA(+)/DHA(+) group (Supple-
mentary Table 10 and Supplementary Figure 2). Using IPA, we
queried the differentially regulated genes for the top ‘Diseases
and Bio Functions’ annotations, which revealed that genes in the
‘Neurological Disease’, ‘Behavior’ and ‘Nervous System Develop-
ment and Function’ categories were enriched (Supplementary
Table 11). Detailed annotations of these categories showed
‘myelination (remyelination and white matter damage)’, ‘various
behaviors related to schizophrenia’ and ‘interneurons’ (Figure 2b
and Supplementary Table 12).

 Expression levels
of genes related to the oligodendrocyte
system36–39 and the GABA-containing interneuron system40,41 have
been shown to be decreased compared to normal in the postmortem
brains of people with schizophrenia. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis in
the PFC validated that the oligodendrocyte-related genes Cldn11,
Cspg4, Mbp, Mobp, Mag and the GABA-related gene Sst were
expressed at significantly lower levels in the AA(−)/DHA(−) group than
in the AA(+)/DHA(+) group (Figure 2c). Further examination revealed
changes in the expression levels of other genes reported to be
expressed at non-normal levels in postmortem schizophrenic brains,
which include the neurotransmitter receptor genes Drd1a,42 Drd2,42
Htr1a,43 Htr2a43 and Cnr144 (Supplementary Table 13).

PUFA deficiency and nuclear receptors in schizophrenia
M Maekawa et al
5
Translational Psychiatry (2017), 1 – 11
 In addition to downregulation of genes, the mRNA expression
of the GABA-receptor subunit GABRA2 has been reported to be
14% higher in layer 2 of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of
individuals with schizophrenia,45 which might reflect a compen-
satory counterpoising in response to a dampened GABAergic
system.46 In our mice, Gabra2 expression was enhanced in the
AA( − )/DHA( − ) group (Figure 2c), indicating another similarity
between the AA( − )/DHA( − ) group and people with schizophrenia.
Although the GABA content in the cortex did not differ between
the two groups (Supplementary Table 14), the results were in
agreement with clinical data on GABA concentration in schizo-
phrenia by using magnetic resonance spectroscopy.47
Nuclear receptors regulate the expression of oligodendrocyte- and
GABA-related genes
Next, we utilized the IPA to predict upstream transcriptional
regulators of the genes we identified as differentially expressed
after withholding AA and DHA from the diet. The results showed an
enrichment of genes involved in the nuclear receptor-transcription
pathway
(Supplementary
Tables
15
and
16;
Supplementary
Figure 3), including Rxra, Rxrb, Rxrg, Ppara, Pparb/d, Pparg, Rars
and
Srebfs.
Importantly,
these transcription-factor
genes
are
associated with nutrition (especially fatty acids).48 We confirmed
that Rxra, Rxrb and Ppara were significantly downregulated and that
Pparb/d trended toward lower expression in the PFC of the AA( − )/
DHA( − )group than in the ARA(+)/DHA(+) group (Figure 2d). Expres-
sion level of Rara was increased and expression level of Srebf1 was
decreased (Supplementary Table 17).
Furthermore, Rxr or Ppar-binding motifs were identified in the
core promoter regions of 9 (Cldn11, Olig2, Cspg4, Mbp, Mal, Mobp,
Gad1, Gabra2 and Sst) (Supplementary Table 18) out of the 14
oligodendrocyte-
and
GABAergic
interneuron-related
genes
(Figure 2c). Interestingly and importantly, such motifs are also
present
in
the
corresponding
gene
promoters
in
humans
(Supplementary Table 19), suggesting that Rxr/RXR or Ppar/PPAR
may directly regulate the expression of these oligodendrocyte- or
GABA-related genes and the function is conserved between mice
and human.
Moreover, multiple significant correlations were observed
between the expression of genes encoding transcription-factors
(candidate nuclear receptor genes) and their downstream targets
(oligodendrocyte- and GABAergic interneuron-related genes) in
the PFCs of mice from all four diet groups (n = 32) (Supplementary
Table 20), thus suggesting upstream regulation by the nuclear
receptors. Notably, the expression levels of Rxra and Ppara were
highly correlated with the expression levels of Olig2 (Rxra;
Spearman’s ρ = 0.8892, Po0.0001, Ppara; Spearman’s ρ = 0.8937,
Po0.0001) and Gad1 (Rxra; Spearman’s ρ = 0.9099, Po0.0001,
Ppara;
Spearman’s
ρ = 0.8601,
Po0.0001)
(Figure
2e
and
Supplementary Table 20). To examine whether Rxra and Ppara
regulate the expression of Olig2 and Gad1 in the same cells, we
further immunohistochemically confirmed the co-expression of
Rxra and Ppara in the Olig2 and Gad1 (Gad67)-expressing cells in
the mouse PFC (Figure 2f).
The RXR pan-agonist bexarotene enhanced expression of
oligodendrocyte- and GABA-related genes
As the expression level of nuclear receptors, Rxra and Ppara were
highly correlated with the Olig2 and Gad1 expression; we intended
to evaluate the effect of nuclear receptor mediated regulation of
downstream genes pharmacologically. We analyzed the effects of
the RXR pan-agonist bexarotene and the PPAR pan-agonist
bezafibrate on the expression levels of the target genes, by using
the oligodendrocyte cell line OLP6—derived from the ventrolat-
eral region of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (rat neuronal cell line)49
—and GABA-containing KATO-III cells derived from human
stomach cancer cells (signet ring cell carcinoma).50 Bexarotene
treatment increased the expression levels of the oligodendrocyte-
related genes Olig2, Cldn11, Mal and Mbp-long in OLP6 cells
(Figure 3a). Similarly, bezafibrate also increased the expression of
Olig2, Mal and Mbp-long mRNA (Figure 3a). Bexarotene increased
CCK and CALB2 mRNA levels at 30 μM, whereas bezafibrate
decreased CALB2 mRNA expression
at both concentrations
(Figure 3b). Treatment did not change expression levels of other
oligodendrocyte-related genes or GABA-related genes in either
cell line (data not shown). These results suggest that RXR and
PPAR regulate the expression of oligodendrocyte- and GABA-
related genes in vitro.
Because more cogent in vitro effects were seen in the
oligodendrocyte and GABAergic systems after treatment with
bexarotene than with bezafibrate, we next examined the effect of
bexarotene in vivo. We administrated vehicle or bexarotene (30 or
100 mg kg −1) to the mice for 3 weeks. Then we examined the
expression of oligodendrocyte- and GABA-related genes in the
PFC of the mice 24 h after the last injection. The 30 mg kg − 1
bexarotene treatment elicited a trend toward increased expres-
sion of Olig2 and Apc (Figure 3c and Supplementary Table 21).
Behaviorally, bexarotene treatment (30 mg kg − 1) for 3 weeks
tended to suppress the hyper-locomotive responses induced by
MK-801 (0.3 mg kg − 1), injected 24 h after the last administration
of bexarotene (Figures 3d and e). These in vitro and in vivo results
thus
supported
the
roles
of
nuclear
receptor
systems
in
schizophrenia-related pathophysiology.
Rxra and Ppara expression levels were related to promoter DNA
methylation
Promoter DNA methylation is known as an important regulatory
component of gene expression. Because the cardinal roles of the
Rxra and Ppara genes
in regulating oligodendrocyte-
and
GABAergic interneuron-related genes have been identified, we
asked whether the downregulation of these nuclear receptors
under PUFA deprivation might be mediated by DNA methylation

 at Rxra and Ppara gene promoters. To this end, we examined the
methylation levels of individual CpG sites in the core promoter
regions of Rxra and Ppara, by bisulfite sequencing analysis of
cortical samples from the AA(+)/DHA(+) and AA(− )/DHA( − ) groups
(Supplementary Figure 4).
In the case of the Rxra promoter, the CpG-3 site showed
significantly higher methylation levels in the AA( − )/DHA( − ) group
than in the AA(+)/DHA(+) group, and the CpG-10 site showed a
similar trend (Figure 4a). The mean methylation levels of Rxra over
the entire interval exhibited a higher trend in the AA( − )/DHA( − )
group (3.34%) than in the AA(+)/DHA(+) group (1.35%) (Figure 4b).
For the Ppara promoter, the CpG-20 site displayed significantly
higher methylation levels in the AA( − )/DHA( − ) group than in the
AA(+)/DHA(+) group, and the CpG-4, -9 and -13 sites exhibited
similar trends (Figure 4c). The mean methylation levels of the
whole Ppara promoter region did not differ between the two
groups (Figure 4d). Most of the differentially methylated sites in
both genes were within putative transcriptional factor-binding

level of methylation of specific CpGs in the Rxra or Ppara
promoters may induce negative relationships with their mRNA
expression through the change of the response to the binding
motifs.

methylation,51,52 we also compared expression levels of Dnmt1
[DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 1], Dnmt3a-1, Dnmt3a-2 and
Dnmt3b between the AA(+)/DHA(+) and AA( − )/DHA( − ) groups in 3-
week-old mice to complement the differential methylation levels
observed in the Rxra and Ppara promoters. Dnmt3b was expressed
significantly more in the AA( − )/DHA( − ) group than in the AA(+)/
DHA(+) group, Dnmt3a-2 expression followed a similar trend
(Figure 4e). DNA methylation may therefore be one of the
mechanisms that links dietary nutrition (in this case, the presence
or absence of PUFAs in the diet) to long-lasting changes in gene-
expression levels.
Low expression of nuclear receptor genes in hair-follicle cells from
individuals with schizophrenia
To test whether expression levels of nuclear receptor genes are
associated with the pathophysiology of schizophrenia in humans,
we probed the transcript-expression levels of nuclear receptors
(RXRs and PPARs) in hair-follicle cells from two cohorts of Japanese
people with schizophrenia and in those without schizophrenia
(controls). These samples were the same that was used in our prior
study.19 In the first cohort of samples (control, n = 62; schizo-
phrenia, n = 52), RXRA, PPARA and PPARB/D were significantly
downregulated
(Po0.05)
in
individuals
with
schizophrenia
compared with the control subjects (Table 1). In an additional
independent sample set (control, n = 55; schizophrenia, n = 42),
the findings for PPARA and PPARB/D were replicated (Table 1), thus
suggesting that these nuclear receptor genes are involved in the
pathophysiology of schizophrenia. We also examined expression
levels of myelin- and GABA- related genes in hair follicles, and
correlations between the expression levels of nuclear receptor
genes and GABA- or oligodendrocyte-related genes in the
combined samples (n = 211) (Supplementary Table 22). These
analyses revealed that the expression levels of specific nuclear
receptor genes were correlated to the expression levels of target
genes. For example, the expression level of RXRA was highly
correlated with that of the oligodendrocyte-related gene CSPG4
(Spearman’s ρ = 0.54770, Po0.0001). These data also suggest that
those nuclear receptors control gene expression of GABA- or
oligodendrocyte-related genes.
DISCUSSION
In the current study, we demonstrated that gestational and early
postnatal dietary deprivation of PUFAs (AA and DHA) in mice
elicited behavioral signs reminiscent of early psychosis (the

to
MK-801.
The
greater
immobility
in
the
tail-
suspension test is related to depressive symptoms observed in
the prodromal state of schizophrenia.53,54 Concurrently, it is also
reported that prenatal famine can lead to not only adult
schizophrenia but also depression.55 At the molecular level, the
observed behavioral deficits were accompanied by dysregulated
expression
of
genes
associated
with
oligodendrocytes
and
GABAergic systems, which was also reported in postmortem
shizophrenia brain.36–41 Our results suggest that dysregulation of
oligodendrocyte- and GABA-related genes may have already
occurred in an early phase of schizophrenia. In addition, the
current mouse model exhibited altered neural activities in the
mPFC during a cognitive task, which is seen in clinical cases of
schizophrenia,33–35
making
this
model
further
suitable
for
recapitulating key aspects of schizophrenia pathophysiology.
This study also revealed that the epigenetic silencing of nuclear
receptor genes Rxr and Ppar is a molecular event upstream from
the dysregulated expression of oligodendrocyte and GABAergic
system genes. Our results indicating up-regulation of de novo DNA
(cytosine-5)-methyltransferases, Dnmt3a-2 and Dnmt3b, in the
AA( − )/DHA( − ) group relative to the AA(+)/DHA(+) group are
consistent with a scenario in which increased de novo methylation
of nuclear receptor genes was induced by changes in the
mother’s diet.
Supplementation of PUFAs during the gestation and/or lacta-
tion period is known to influence DNA methylation.56–59 It was
also reported that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a metabolite of AA,
alters DNA methylation status.60,61 PUFAs and their metabolites
might have a role in the epigenetic changes of nuclear receptor
genes observed between the different diets. In parallel, the
preformed AA and DHA are substrates for pro-inflammatory (for
example, AA-PGE2) and anti-inflammatory (for example, DHA-D-
resolvins) processes, respectively.62 Thus, the involvement of pro-
and anti-inflammatory mechanisms in the current model mice
should be examined in a future study.
Mouse63,64 and human65,66 genetic studies have supported the
potential roles of RXR or PPAR genes in the susceptibility to
schizophrenia. The current findings showing that expression of
RXRA, PPARA and PPARB/D is abnormally reduced in the hair-
follicle cells of patients with schizophrenia not only support their
putative role in schizophrenia pathogenesis but also suggest that
this measure is a potential biomarker for schizophrenia. For
example, scrutinizing the expression levels of genes for nuclear
receptors in hair follicles would be useful to stratify complex
schizophrenia pathophysiology. In addition, the combination of
drugs and companion diagnostics by using hair follicles may bring
potential value for patients.
Bexarotene (Targretin, LC Laboratories) is a third-generation
retinoid drug that functions via activation of RXR receptors and is
approved for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European
Medicines Agency (EMA).67 In addition, bexarotene was evaluated
as an antipsychotic-augmenting agent in a phase III clinical trial
(NCT00535574). It was reported that add-on oral bexarotene to
antipsychotic treatment in schizophrenia patients induced sig-
nificant improvements in positive and negative symptoms with
moderate effect size.68,69 On the basis of our results, we speculate
that bexarotene’s effects might be partly exerted by rectifying
oligodendrocyte- and/or GABA- gene expression through nuclear
receptor stimulation. Therefore, the current study could be a
proof-of-concept (POC) for the use of bexarotene in clinical
practice. Our results further suggest that the drug could be useful
for subjects at risk for the schizophrenia mental state to prevent
progression into evident psychosis.
Initially, n −3 PUFA supplementation was shown to be beneficial
in disease prevention;70–72 however, a recent double-blind,
placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial did not find that
supplementation prevented the transition to psychosis in young
people at ultra-high risk for psychosis.73 Our study suggests that
stratifying
schizophrenia
in
terms
of
subsets
of
principal
pathophysiologies, if any (such as nuclear receptor gene expres-
sion in hair-follicle cells), could be helpful to draw a firm
conclusion on the preventive effect of n − 3 PUFA supplementa-
tion. In accord, it is known that elevated maternal DHA is
associated with an increased risk for the development of
schizophrenia in offspring.74 Although the DHA(+)-dams had
higher DHA contents in milk than the DHA(− )-dams, we did not
find any worse scores in schizophrenia-related behaviors in the
DHA(+)-offspring than in the DHA( − )-offspring.
Linoleic acid (18:2 n −6) and alpha-linolenic acid (18:3 n − 3) can
be converted to AA and DHA, respectively, in the rodent
brain.75–78 In the current study, the contents of AA and DHA
were significantly increased in the mother’s milk of the AA(+)/
DHA(+) group compared with that of the AA(− )/DHA( − ) mice. Also,

PUFA deficiency and nuclear receptors in schizophrenia
M Maekawa et al

Translational Psychiatry (2017), 1 – 11
 the ‘AA content- and DHA content-related indices’ were changed
in an expected manner in the pups’ cortex at 3 weeks old
according to the diet formula. Therefore, supplementation or
deletion of AA and DHA in the diet is thought to have a role in the
alterations of behavioral outcomes, gene expression and DNA
methylation status observed among mice fed the different diets.
Given that the amount of preformed AA or DHA in the standard
rodent chow (CRF-1) is small (Supplementary Table 1), the current
results support the hypothesis of beneficial effects of supplemen-
tation of AA and DHA in neurodevelopmental stages.
However, the limitations of this study include the importance of
future experiments to examine the contents of PUFAs, in particular
AA and DHA, in earlier embryonic brain developmental stages. In
our study, the embryonic cortex was too small to obtain reliable
data but future experiments using new methods may better
examine this prediction. Other unsolved issues include: (1) the
distinct and/or combinatorial roles of AA and DHA, along with
their critical doses, should be further clarified, and (2) the timing of
the ‘epigenetic window’, a critical period for the generation of
epigenetic
changes,79,80
remains
an
important
unanswered
question.
In summary, we showed that PUFA deficiency during the early
neurodevelopmental period in mice could model the prodromal
state of schizophrenia most likely through epigenetic silencing of
nuclear receptor genes, thereby dysregulating downstream neural
gene expression. Our mouse model also provides an example
strategy for elucidating how early-stage environmental insults are
intertwined with the risk for schizophrenia.
