Abstract This trial assessed the efficacy of MR309 (a novel
selective sigma-1 receptor ligand previously developed as
E-52862) in ameliorating oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neu-
ropathy (oxaipn). A discontinuous regimen of MR309 (400
mg/day, 5 days per cycle) was tested in patients with colorectal
cancer receiving FOLFOX in a phase II, randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial. Outcome
measures included changes in 24-week quantitative measures
of thermal sensitivity and total neuropathy score. In total, 124
patients were randomized (1:1) to MR309 or placebo. Sixty-
three (50.8%) patients withdrew prematurely before complet-
ing 12 planned oxaliplatin cycles. Premature withdrawal be-
cause of cancer progression was less frequent in the MR309
group (7.4% vs 25.0% with placebo; p = 0.054). MR309 sig-
nificantly reduced cold pain threshold temperature [mean
treatment effect difference (SE) vs placebo: 5.29 (1.60)°C; p
= 0.001] and suprathreshold cold stimulus-evoked pain inten-
sity [mean treatment effect difference: 1.24 (0.57) points; p =
0.032]. Total neuropathy score, health-related quality-of-life
measures, and nerve-conduction parameters changed similarly
in both arms, whereas the proportion of patients with severe
chronic neuropathy (National Cancer Institute Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ≥ 3) was significant-
ly lower in the MR309 group (3.0% vs 18.2% with placebo; p
= 0.046). The total amount of oxaliplatin delivered was greater
in the active arm (1618.9 mg vs 1453.8 mg with placebo; p =
0.049). Overall, 19.0% of patients experienced at least 1
treatment-related adverse event (25.8% and 11.9% with
MR309 and placebo, respectively). Intermittent treatment
with MR309 was associated with reduced acute oxaipn and
higher oxaliplatin exposure, and showed a potential neuropro-
tective role for chronic cumulative oxaipn. Furthermore,
MR309 showed an acceptable safety profile.

Introduction
Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is the
most prevalent neurological complication of anticancer treat-
ment and a common dose-limiting side effect [1]. Oxaliplatin
(OXA) is the cornerstone of colorectal cancer treatment [2]
and is being increasingly used to treat other malignancies.
However, OXA-induced peripheral neuropathy (OXAIPN)

 is the most prominent toxicity both during and after the com-
pletion of chemotherapy, compromising therapeutic outcomes
and patients’ functional capacity and quality of life [1, 3].
OXAIPN usually presents as 2 distinct clinical syndromes
[4]. One is a classic cumulative, chronic sensory neuropathy,
which involves typical features of platinum drug peripheral
neuropathy. The other, more distinctive of OXA, is an acute
transient syndrome characterized by paresthesias and
dysesthesias triggered by exposure to cold in the distal ex-
tremities and the perioral region [5]. The acute syndrome
can also include a neuromyotonia-like syndrome, with motor
hyperexcitability symptoms [1].
The cumulative sensory neuropathy is driven by the capac-
ity of platinum to form DNA adducts and crosslinks, oxidative
stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and increased p53, p38, and
extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 activity in dorsal root gan-
glia neurons [1, 4]. In contrast, acute OXA-induced neuropa-
thy is likely related to the dysfunction of the axonal nodal
voltage-gated sodium channels, in which chelation of intracel-
lular calcium by oxalate and the sensitization of transient re-
ceptor potential channels in dorsal root ganglia neurons play a
role [4]. These effects ultimately lead to reduced axonal re-
fractoriness and superexcitability [6–8].
Effective neuroprotective therapies against OXAIPN or
CIPN have been largely sought. Unfortunately, none of
the agents or therapeutic strategies tested to date has dem-
onstrated unequivocal efficacy [9]. Only duloxetine has
been shown to provide minor—albeit consistent and clin-
ically relevant—relief of pain in patients with established
cumulative OXAIPN [10].
MR309 (CAS registry number 1265917-14-3), previ-
ously developed as E-52862, is a novel selective sigma-
1 receptor (S1R) antagonist. The S1R is a transmembrane
protein found in the endoplasmic reticulum, specifically at
the mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum mem-
brane, and has the ability to translocate to the plasma
membrane [11]. In the nervous system, S1Rs mediate
the regulation of several processes, such as
neuritogenesis, the activity of potassium channels and N-
methyl-D-aspartate receptors, and calcium homeostasis
[11]. S1Rs have a modulatory role in nociception, and
attenuate intracellular signal transduction cascades related
to noxious stimuli and sensitization phenomena [12]. To
date, MR309 is the only molecule of the new drug class
of S1R antagonists that has progressed to clinical devel-
opment [12]. In preclinical studies that included CIPN
models, MR309 reduced hyperalgesic effects, as well as
cold and mechanical allodynia [13, 14], and was able to
prevent the early ultrastructural mitochondrial changes
observed in CIPN [15].
The OXAIPN is a valid disease model to test the modula-
tory effect of S1R antagonists over axonal membrane excit-
ability and their neuroprotective potential. Based on the good
safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic properties of
MR309 at doses up to 400 mg for 8 consecutive days in phase
I clinical studies [16], a proof-of concept phase II clinical trial
was designed with the aim of testing the suitability of MR309
to prevent OXAIPN. To our knowledge, this is the first report
on the neuroprotective efficacy of a S1R antagonist in a clin-
ical trial on CIPN.
Methods
Study Design
This was a proof-of-concept, phase II, randomized (1:1), dou-
ble-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial. It
was carried out in 5 major hospitals in Europe (2 in Spain, 2
in Italy, and 1 in Greece). The ethics committees/institutional
review boards of the participating hospitals approved the
study protocol prior to starting recruitment.
The patients were assessed using both patient-reported out-
comes and objective physician-assessed endpoints.
A synopsis of the protocol and the major results of the trial
are available at: https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-
search/search?query=eudract_number:2012-000398-21.
Patients
Chemotherapy-naïve patients (aged 18–80 years) with co-
lorectal cancer diagnosed within the last 2 years and
scheduled to receive OXA within a FOLFOX chemother-
apeutic regimen were eligible. The main inclusion criteria
were having a planned OXA dose ≥ 60 mg/m2 in the first
cycle, a Karnofsky performance status score ≥ 70, and a
peripheral sensory neuropathy toxicity grade assessed
with the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) of ≤ 1 at re-
cruitment. Patients with neurological conditions that
might interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives,
receiving medications with potential pharmacologic inter-
actions with the study drug (listed in the protocol), or with
a life expectancy < 4 months were excluded. All patients
provided written informed consent to participate.
Randomization and Masking
Patients and investigators were blinded to the allocation.
Patients were randomly assigned to either MR309 or placebo
following a computer-generated sequence of random permu-
tations of 2 elements in blocks of 4. Randomization was strat-
ified according to the type of chemotherapeutic regimen
(FOLFOX 4 or 6 modified, consisting of OXA 85 mg/m2
infusion on day 1 combined with leucovorin and 5-fluoroura-
cil, in a 2-week cycle). Individually sealed opaque envelopes

 were provided in case the investigators needed to know the
allocation of a particular patient in a medical emergency.
MR309 and placebo tablets had identical appearance.
Procedures
Patients received 1 oral daily dose of the study drug or placebo
during the first 5 days of each chemotherapy cycle, up to a
maximum of 12 cycles (Fig. 1a). In the active group, each
tablet contained 400 mg MR309. This intermittent, rather than
continuous dosing regimen was decided because repeated dos-
ing schedules > 8 days had not been tested by the time of
protocol development. During chemotherapy, 2 visits were
done during chemotherapy cycles 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, and 12. The
first visit occurred 1 day before the planned start of chemother-
apy infusions (precycle assessment) and the second between
24 and 48 h following the end of OXA infusion. A follow-up
visit was done 6 weeks after the end of chemotherapy.
Outcomes
In this proof-of-concept study, no primary and secondary end-
points were predefined. The relative degree of acute OXAIPN
syndrome was quantitatively assessed by changes of cold pain
perception versus baseline, providing the cold pain threshold
(CPT) and the intensity of pain evoked by suprathreshold cold
stimuli on the skin covering the thenar eminence. Both were
determined with the method of limits from a resting tempera-
ture of 32°C with the Thermal Sensory Analyser II by Medoc
[for a more complete description of this quantitative sensory
testing (QST) procedure, see [17]]. Evoked pain was mea-
sured in both the dominant and nondominant hands. In addi-
tion, the warm detection threshold (WDT) and cold detection
thresholds (CDT) were measured by QST to monitor acute
neuropathy of non-nociceptive small nerve fibers. Thermal
QST is specially suitable for the diagnosis of small-fiber neu-
ropathy that cannot be assessed by standard nerve conduction
studies (NCS) [18]. The incidence of sensory and motor signs
and symptoms of acute OXAIPN were measured by the OXA
Neuropathy Questionnaire (OXA-NQ) as used previously [5].

 of the total neuropathy score (TNS; score range 0–28, with
higher values indicating more severe neuropathy) [19]; the
grade of peripheral sensory neuropathy toxicity was assessed
with the NCI-CTCAE scale, NCS and patient-reported out-
come measures from the European Organization for Research
and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC). The doses of OXA deliv-
ered throughout the study were also recorded. Safety was an-
alyzed as the incidence of adverse events (AEs) by severity,
AEs leading to withdrawal, and AEs related to the study drug.
Statistical Analyses
This was a proof-of-concept exploratory study. Therefore no
adjustment by multiplicity was made to account for the vari-
ous endpoints considered. Sample size was determined to de-
tect, with a power of 80%, a difference of 7.1 points between
study group means for TNS at the end of chemotherapy [20].
Sample size was calculated based on this endpoint, as it re-
quired larger sample sizes than QST-based endpoints (internal
calculations based on the results of a previous study by the
authors [17]). The evolution of QST-based endpoints and of
the TNS was compared between study arms using generalized
linear mixed models for longitudinal data with the study group
and site as fixed factors, the baseline value as covariate, and
the patient as a random factor. Some models were also adjust-
ed by the total accumulated amount (mg) of OXA delivered.
Transversal comparisons (at specific time points) between
study groups were done using Mann–Whitney tests for con-
tinuous endpoints and either Pearson’s χ2 or Fisher’s exact
tests for proportions. Time-to-event endpoints (time to with-
drawal, the duration of signs and symptoms of acute neurop-
athy, and time to first occurrence of grade ≥ 3 NCI-CTCAE
neuropathy) were described using the Kaplan–Meier method
and compared by means of log-rank tests. Efficacy analyses
were done on an intention-to-treat basis, using the data from
all patients who had a baseline evaluation and at least 1
postbaseline assessment available. For sensitivity analyses,
descriptions and inferences were repeated on a per-protocol
set. Safety was analyzed on patients who received at least 1
dose of the study drug. Some post-hoc analyses were per-
formed to further explore the beneficial effects that were ob-
served in the acute neuropathy. These are marked as such in
the exposition of results. All analyses were done with the
version 9.1.3 of the statistical package SAS (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Patient Characteristics and Disposition
Between 27 September 2012 and 4 April 2014, 137 patients
were recruited, of whom 124 (61 from Spain, 14 from Italy,
and 49 from Greece) were randomized (62 to MR309, 62 to
placebo) (Fig. 1b). Baseline demographic characteristics were
similar between the groups (Table 1). Although the average
number of cycles and the incidence of OXA dose reductions
were similar in both groups, the total accumulated amount of
OXA delivered was greater in the MR309 group. The differ-
ence only reached statistical significance for the raw dose
(1618.9 mg vs 1453.8 mg with placebo; p = 0.049), not for
the body surface area-adjusted dose (911.0 mg/m2 vs 822.3
mg/m2 with placebo; p = 0.062). Despite being lower with
MR309, the proportion of patients who withdrew prematurely
did not differ significantly between the groups [27/62 (43.5%)
vs 36/62 (58.1%); p = 0.106]. However, this difference was
nearly significant for premature withdrawals due to cancer
progression [2/27 (7.4%) vs 9/36 (25.0%); p = 0.054].
Approximately half of patients (50.4%) had advanced cancer
(stages ≥ IIIC): 53.2% in the MR309 group and 47.5% in the
placebo group. Forty patients (32.3%) had metastatic disease.

 Effects on Acute OXAIPN
Figures 2, 3, and 4 show the evolution of CPT, thermal detec-
tion thresholds, and suprathreshold cold-evoked pain mea-
sures throughout the study. There were significant differences
between the study groups favoring MR309 in the evolution of
CPT at both the precycle and postcycle assessments, and the
intensity of the pain evoked by suprathreshold cold stimuli at
precycle assessments. As expected, after the first chemother-
apy cycle, the temperature at CPT abruptly raised (cold was
perceived as painful at higher temperatures) in the placebo
group, indicating the induction of cold pain hyperalgesia after
the first OXA application, whereas in the MR309 group the
increase was more subtle. Just after the first cycle, the mean
raw difference was above 3°C, favoring MR309 (Fig. 2b). The
mean treatment effect differences (MTEDs) were even greater,
around 5°C (Fig. 2a, b). A discrete thermal hypoesthesia de-
veloped throughout chemotherapy in the placebo group, as
denoted by the progressive separation of WDT and CDT from
the resting temperature (Fig. 3). Although the MTEDs for
WDT and CDT were not significant, the between-group dif-
ference of WDT significantly favored the MR309 group at
cycle 12 (Fig. 3b).
The intensity of cold-evoked pain increased as chemother-
apy progressed and declined during the follow-up period in
both study groups, but the increase was more pronounced in
the placebo group up to the second cycle (Fig. 4). The
resulting separation, which reached 0.5 points in a 10-point
pain scale at some visits, was significant in the precycle mea-
surements (Fig. 4a, c). In fact, the MTEDs were > 1 point over
in the 10-point pain scale.
The pre- to postcycle changes were unfavorable in both
groups. However, interpretation is challenging because
this assessment is strongly influenced by what occurred
from the previous cycle (e.g., in some instances the level
of pain rose less in the placebo group than in the MR309
group because patients on placebo started from a much
higher pain level at the precycle visit resulting from a
more pronounced worsening from the previous cycle).
For brevity, these results are not included, but a complete
set of illustrative figures is available on request.
The mean count of signs and symptoms of acute neuropa-
thy as reported by patients in the OXA-NQ was similar in both
study groups up to cycle 10 (Fig. 5). At cycle 12 and at the end
of chemotherapy—regardless of whether it was cycle 12 or
before—the count was somewhat lower in the MR309 group,

 yet the differences did not reach statistical significance (Fig.
5a). However, the post-hoc analysis of 7 signs and symptoms
related to motor hyperexcitability yielded average counts that
were consistently lower in the MR309 group, and this differ-
ence reached statistical significance at the end of chemother-
apy (Fig. 5b). The mean count of sensory symptoms (3 items
regarding cold-induced paresthesia) was similar in both
groups (Fig. 5c). Overall, all signs and symptoms included
in the OXA-NQ lasted longer in the placebo group than in
the MR309 group, yet the differences reached statistical sig-
nificance only for difficulties in swallowing at cycle 12 (p =
0.023). A complete set of Kaplan–Meier plots is available on
request.
Effects on Cumulative OXAIPN
The TNS showed progressive impairment throughout the
study that was comparable in both groups (Fig. 6). The
MTEDs were trivial both in a model that adjusted by
baseline differences (Fig. 6a) and in a post-hoc model that
additionally adjusted by the total amount of OXA deliv-
ered (Fig. 6b). Treatment effects were not significant.
On average, the grade of peripheral sensory neuropathy
as per the NCI-CTCAE increased in parallel in both
groups throughout the study. The proportions of patients
who developed grade 2 or worse toxicity up to the follow-
up assessment did not differ significantly between the
groups [37/46 MR309 patients evaluated, 80.4% vs 28/
41 placebo patients evaluated, 68.3% (p = 0.193)].
Nonetheless, the proportion of patients who showed grade
3 (severe) or worse toxicity was significantly lower in the
MR309 group compared with the placebo group [1/33
patients evaluated, 3.0% vs 6/33 patients evaluated,
18.2% (p = 0.046)]. In contrast, other efficacy endpoints
for cumulative OXAIPN varied in line with the TNS. The
measures of sensory nerve conduction (Fig. 7) and the
EORTC measures of health-related quality of life (data
available on request) declined similarly in both groups
throughout the study. Treatment effects were nonsignifi-
cant in all instances.

 Safety
The proportion of patients with at least 1 AE related to study
drug was higher in the MR309 group (25.8% in the MR309
group vs 11.9% in the placebo group; p = 0.051) (Table 2).
Nausea, diarrhea, mucositis, decreased appetite, dysgeusia,
and oral paresthesia were slightly more frequent in the
MR309 group. Among treatment-related AEs, only some
concerning the nervous system [dizziness, headache and neu-
rotoxicity (2 patients each)] were more common in the
MR309 group (Table 2).
The sensitivity analyses (in the per-protocol set) yielded
similar results to the main analyses, with the exception that
the treatment effect over the intensity of cold-evoked pain in
the nondominant hand in favor of MR309 was nonsignificant
(data available on request).

 Discussion
The selective S1R antagonist MR309 was able to partially
preserve the CPT, reduce cold-evoked pain, and motor hyper-
excitability signs and symptoms in patients with colorectal
cancer treated with OXA. In contrast, the efficacy against
cumulative OXAIPN was inconsistent as clinical benefits
were just observed with one of the tools employed.
Nevertheless, patients in the active group were able to receive
a higher accumulated amount of OXA. In addition, MR309
showed acceptable safety and tolerability profiles. These re-
sults suggest that this first-in-class drug with a novel mecha-
nism of action improves some symptoms and signs of acute
OXAIPN.
At baseline, CDT and WDT, between 3–4°C and 2–3°C
below and above the resting temperature of 32°C, respec-
tively, were normal and consistent with those reported in
other studies [21–23]. The CPT was closer to resting tem-
peratures compared with what was reported in these stud-
ies but still within the wide range of response of C
polymodal nociceptors [24] and within the range reported
in a review of previous studies [22]. During the initial
chemotherapy cycles, when the confusion brought by
structural axonal damage or loss secondary to platinum
deposition in neuronal bodies is not expected, patients
treated with MR309 showed significantly less cold
allodynia (CPT closer to baseline levels) and cold
hyperalgesia (lower intensity of cold-evoked pain) than
patients treated with placebo. Non-nociceptive cold per-
ception primarily relies on specialized Aδ fibers that form
cold-sensitive free terminals in the skin and project into
the cold pathways sensing innocuous cold stimuli (re-
sponse range between 17°C and 40°C), and on Aδ fiber
type I mechano-heat nociceptors and C polymodal
nociceptors that sense noxious cold (response range be-
tween −10°C and 20°C) [24]. Since a dynamic opposition
has been described between activity in the cold sensitive
and nociceptive pathways [25], the simultaneous reduc-
tion of the excitability in both paths by MR309 would
be required to produce the observed effects.
Despite the fact that acute OXAIPN rarely led to treatment
withdrawal in this study, several findings stress the importance
of discovering a novel, effective agent to prevent it. Firstly,
there is evidence suggesting that acute OXAIPN is linked to
the occurrence and severity of the cumulative neuropathy [6,
7, 26, 27]. Secondly, although the clinical relevance of the
reduction of cold-evoked pain for the tested patients is un-
known, MR309 was able, even in a nonintensive dosing reg-
imen, to improve both objective physical parameters and sub-
jective clinical indicators of acute OXAIPN.
However, the results do not consistently support the
neuroprotective potential of this agent on cumulative
OXAIPN. Although the TNS has been regarded as useful
for measuring the severity of chronic peripheral toxic

 neuropathies caused by cytostatic agents [28] and showed
higher sensitivity to CIPN effects than the NCI-CTCAE
scale [19], only the latter instrument showed the superior-
ity of MR309 over placebo in reducing the transition from
grade 2 to grade 3 or higher chronic neuropathy. The
values of the TNS in this study were similar to those
reported in a large series of patients who received compa-
rable OXA schedules [27]. Likewise, the proportion of
patients who developed severe neuropathy according to
NCI-CTCAE in our placebo group was comparable to
the incidence reported previously in patients treated with
OXA [6, 27] but was significantly lower in the MR309
group. Why the TNS was not sensitive to the MR309
effects sensed with the NCI-CTCAE toxicity scale is not
clear. The TNS is a global measure of peripheral nerve
function that entails a range of neurological examinations,
but it is not specifically devoted to sensory symptoms.
Furthermore, it places much emphasis on the spatial dis-
tribution and extension of sensory alterations (4/7 items),
so that severity is virtually equated to extension, whereas
the NCI-CTCAE is chiefly a subjective assessment of the
functional impact of the symptoms of neuropathy [19].

 Whether or not functional limitations were key in the dis-
parity was not clarified by the results obtained for the health-
related quality-of-life measures, as these did not differ be-
tween the study groups. Although the measure used in this
study (the EORTC-CIPN20) is one patient-reported outcome
that has gained wide recognition for CIPN assessment, it is
still under development, and a very recent report has raised
concerns about its psychometric properties [29]. Thus, techni-
cal issues might have contributed to inconclusive results.
Also, a longer time lapse might be required to sense QoL
compromises caused by peripheral neuropathy [3, 30].
Neither of the NCS provided additional information, as they
found comparable declines in the amplitudes of action poten-
tials and the conduction velocities in both study groups. These
findings are consistent with the scarce correlation reported
between objective physician-assessed measures and the
CIPN symptoms reported by patients [31].
In addition to the large-fiber sensory neuropathy usually
associated with OXAIPN, the relative warm hypoesthesia that
developed during anticancer treatment in the placebo group
may be interpreted as a discrete cumulative small-fiber neu-
ropathy, which is in line with histological findings on
intraepidermal nerve-fiber density [32].
The accumulated dose of OXA was significantly greater in
the MR309 group. This may have also contributed to blunting
of the differences between groups at the end of the study,
because the severity of OXAIPN is related to the dose deliv-
ered [1]. Speculatively, MR309 might have improved the tol-
erability of OXA, allowing a greater exposure before the signs
and symptoms of neuropathy leveled in accordance with those
observed in the placebo group. In turn, augmenting the expo-
sure to OXA might improve the antineoplastic efficacy of the
chemotherapy. It is also worth noting that some concerns have
been raised regarding the potential effects of neuropathy pre-
vention drugs on the antitumor properties of OXA, in particu-
lar the liability to reduce its therapeutic activity [33]. This study
found no evidence of such reduction. On the contrary, fewer
patients in the MR309 group withdrew from the study prema-
turely because of cancer progression than in the placebo group.
MR309 was well tolerated. As expected in patients with
cancer receiving chemotherapy, nearly all had AEs during the
study, but only a small fraction was related to the investigation-
al drug. With the exception of neutropenia and thrombocytope-
nia (one patient each; Table 2), no related AE was unexpected,
unanticipated, or had unusual severity. Special attention should
be paid to hematologic AEs in future studies of MR309.
The major limitation of this proof-of-concept study lies in
its exploratory nature. Since no primary and secondary end-
points were predefined, it should be regarded as hypothesis-
generating, inductive research. Because several measures of
OXAIPN were compared between groups, multiplicity issues
might have compromised the type I error rate. Therefore, the
observed protection MR309 offered against acute neuropathy,
including symptoms of sensory and motor hyperexcitability,
as well as severe cumulative neuropathy must be confirmed in
larger, dedicated studies.
We conclude that the selective S1R antagonist, MR309, re-
duced acute OXAIPN (cold pain and motor symptoms),
allowed patients to be exposed to higher doses of OXA, and
was well tolerated. The effects on cumulative neuropathy were
unclear; however, the reduced incidence of grade 3 toxicity and
the known link between the acute and chronic syndromes pro-
vides a basis for further exploration of the full potential of
MR309 in the CIPN setting. This should entail the assessment
of different regimens of administration and continuous dosing
during the full chemotherapy period. To our knowledge, this is
the first report of efficacy of an agent specifically targeted to-
wards putative pathophysiological mechanisms involved in
neuronal hyperexcitability and neurotoxicity. Given the lack
of innovation in the development of neuropreventive drugs in
recent decades [9], the discovery of a new agent based on novel
molecular targets may represent a relevant medical progress.
