Language plays an important role in romantic attachment. However, it is unclear whether the structure 
and topic of language use might influence potential mate choice. We investigated 124 female students’ 
preference for compliments paid by males incorporating either literal or metaphoric (conventional/
novel) language and targeting their appearance or possessions (house) throughout their menstrual 
cycle. Male faces paired with novel metaphorical compliments were rated as more attractive by women 
than those paired with literal ones. Compliments targeting appearance increased male attractiveness 
more than possessions. Interestingly, compliments on appearance using novel metaphors were 
preferred by women in a relationship during the fertile phase but by single women during the luteal 
phase. A similar pattern of altered face attraction ratings was subsequently shown by subjects in the 
absence of the verbal compliments and even though they were unable to recognize the faces. Thus 
the maintained attraction bias for faces previously associated with figurative language compliments 
appears to be unconscious. Overall this study provides the first evidence that women find men who 
typically use novel metaphorical language to compliment appearance more attractive than those using 
prosaic language or complimenting possessions. The evolutionary significance for such a language use 
bias in mate selection is discussed.
There has been considerable debate concerning the factors that may have contributed to the evolution of complex 
human language1. Language, as an additional system for social communication and information transmission, 
is one of the most radical major adaptive changes in human evolutionary terms2. Its “digital infinity” in structure 
that is similar to the genetic system, and “lexical flexibility” in meaning generation are integrated to provide a 
powerful tool for cultural transmission3. However, it remains unclear how such a system emerged and evolved 
from protolanguage to modern forms that consist of complex syntax and function.
One hypothesis is that the complexity of modern language might have been shaped by a “mating mind”4 
rather than by “iterated learning”3 or merely by a “problem-solving mind”5. For humans, according to Miller4, lan-
guage, music, humor, art, etc. are not simply the side-effects of other biological adaptations, but have also evolved 
through sexual selection pressure to signal a male’s hidden traits of intelligence and creativity. Indeed, studies 
have consistently demonstrated that intelligence or creativity attributes are preferred by women6–9. Few attempts 
have been made to support this proposal empirically, although several studies have reported that men who use 
the most complex and creative language either as poets6, or prose writers9, have the most female partners. Men’s 
dating success has also been found to be correlated with their creativity8. Furthermore, the linguistic strategy used 
by men who were given photos of young, attractive women and required to imagine a romantic encounter with 
them was to display novelty by using less common words7.
Undisputedly, linguistic ability is part of cognitive intelligence10,11, and provides a variety of different ways to 
express the same meaning, thereby enhancing our creative potential. Figurative language, particularly the use of 
metaphor, is regarded as a typical linguistic structure that reflects intellectual creativity and wit12. Metaphors, which

project from one conceptual domain to another, involve higher cognition processes13 and greater activation in key 
brain language and cognitive processing areas such as the inferior frontal gyrus, insula and temporal cortices14–16. 
Nevertheless, not all metaphors require the same magnitude of cognitive load, e.g. those stereotyped metaphors we 
are constantly exposed to may require similar efforts to produce and comprehend as literal expressions due to their 
familiarity13,17. Indeed, use of such conventional metaphors may be less associated with fluid intelligence12,18 and are 
distinct from either novel metaphors or literal expressions in terms of difficulty in cognitive processing and ratings 
of creativity and saliency19,20. In the context of the current experiment we therefore hypothesized that women would 
find men using metaphorical language, especially novel metaphors, more attractive.
We generally like people more who praise us by paying verbal compliments21. It is well known that compli-
ments play a vital role in development and maintenance of interpersonal relationships, especially in romantic 
ones. For example, compliment frequency is positively correlated with relationship satisfaction21, and compli-
mentary gambits are often used by men to attract the attention of a potential mate22,23, particularly those target-
ing their physical appearance24. Thus in a courtship context, compliments targeting personal appearance might 
express a stronger sexual interest than those towards some non-personal attribute such as a person’s possessions.
To date, a woman’s preference for a potential mate has been found to be context-dependent and influenced by 
multiple factors25,26. For example, a number of studies have reported that women tend to exhibit a bias towards 
more masculine faces, voices, body and other physical traits during the fertile phase of their menstrual cycle 
although more feminine features at other times27–30. Female perception of male attractiveness also varies depend-
ent upon whether the mating context is short- or long-term31,32, and with their own relationship status33. Thus 
if mate selection is the evolutionary drive for development of creative language, then a woman’s preference for 
certain linguistic structures and individuals should be influenced most during the fertile phase of her menstrual 
cycle when “good genes” in a prospective partner become a prerequisite for reproduction. However, findings are 
still somewhat inconsistent for whether a woman’s preference for intelligence or creativity should be strengthened 
during her fertile phase or not34,35. Furthermore, no studies to date have directly investigated the impact of figu-
rativeness in verbal compliments on female preferences in a courtship context.
In the current study we therefore aimed to investigate: 1) Which type of compliment can increase men’s attrac-
tiveness in women’s eyes, literal or metaphoric? 2) If women prefer compliments targeting their appearance or 
possessions? 3) If the preference for figurativeness and topic of compliment varies during the menstrual cycle? 
Since facial attractiveness is believed to reflect male genetic quality36–38, and to create a courtship context between 
heterosexual strangers39–41, in this experiment female participants were required to rate men’s attractiveness based 
on their facial photos paired with different verbal compliments. The basic design of the experiment was similar to 
that used to demonstrate the impact of first impressions on social attractiveness by pairing the faces of individuals 
of average attractiveness with verbal information about their character42. To help dissociate effects of the attrac-
tiveness of the compliment per se from its specific impact on the attractiveness of an individual’s face associated 
with it, participants rated faces first in conjunction with the verbal compliment and then subsequently in the 
absence of the latter. On the basis of previous studies we hypothesized that: 1) Men who use metaphoric language 
to pay compliments, novel metaphors in particular, will be rated as more attractive than those who use literal 
compliments; 2) Men who compliment a woman’s appearance will be perceived as more attractive than those 
complimenting her possessions and 3) Any observed attraction bias for the figurativeness or topic of compliments 
will be strongest during the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle.
Results
Independent ratings of the compliments used in the main study. 
Two independent groups of 
female subjects rated the compliments used in the main study for either language and appropriateness or per-
ceived characteristics of the male using them. Results are shown in Table S1. As expected both novel and conven-
tional metaphor compliments were rated significantly higher on figurativeness and language attractiveness than 
literal ones independent of their topic (i.e. appearance or possessions). Similarly, the novel metaphor compli-
ments were rated significantly less familiar than the conventional metaphor or literal ones. Literal compliments 
targeting appearance were rated slightly more appropriate linguistically than novel metaphors targeting appear-
ance, and novel metaphors scored lower on imageability than conventional metaphor or literal ones. Importantly 
in the context of the main study there were no significant differences across the six different categories of compli-
ments in terms of their perceived valence (F = 
 0.833, p = 
 0.532, ηp
2 = 
 0.276) or interpersonal attractiveness 
(F = 
 1.885, p = 
 0.112, ηp
2 = 
 0.596). In this case interpersonal attractiveness judgements were made in terms of how 
subjects rated them as being generally appropriate and attractive in an interpersonal context rather than in terms 
of a specific personal preference. Thus there were no perceived differences in how positive the different compli-
ments were or their relevance in a general social context. Results from the second group of raters showed a signif-
icant relationship between figurativeness and perceived intelligence, with literal compliments targeting either 
appearance or possessions being rated lower than metaphorical ones. On the other hand there was no significant 
effect of perceived dominance across the six compliment types (F = 
 0.853, p = 
 0.519, ηp
2 = 
 0.282). Thus in agree-
ment with previous findings10–12, language complexity is particularly associated with perceived intelligence.
Attractiveness ratings in relation to LAS questionnaire scores. 
In the main study no group differ-
ences were found in questionnaire scores and cycle length between women in the two different relationship status 
groups (see Table 1).
Two participants did not fully complete the LAS questionnaire and so could not be included in the analysis. 
Among the six LAS types, female participants predominantly exhibited a primary Storge style (practical or logical 
love – 45.61%) and a secondary Pragma style (friendship-based love – 68.42%). According to PLS, 86% of female 
participants in the relationship group were in passionate love and 58.14% of these were wildly and recklessly in love.

A percentage homogeneity test found no significant overall difference between relationship status and LAS 
(Cramer’s V = 
 0.093 for primary type and 0.132 for secondary type). Even though the single women group 
had a slightly different profile of attitudes from those of women in a relationship, the proportion of women 
exhibiting the different love styles in the relationship and singles groups did not differ significantly (see 
Supplementary Table S2). The proportions of women exhibiting the different LAS types were similar in the differ-
ent phases of the menstrual cycle.
LAS types were not found to be correlated with the attractiveness ratings for faces paired with the different 
compliments in the relationship group although for the singles condition there was a correlation between LAS 
Storge and the attractiveness of conventional compliments targeting possessions (r = 0.233, p = 0.013).
Overall effects of compliments on attractiveness ratings. 
Paired-sample t tests revealed that 
compliments significantly increased attractiveness ratings. In session one, faces paired with verbal compli-
ments (M = 
 4.404, SD = 
 0.648) were rated significantly more attractive than those presented alone (M = 
 4.258, 
SD = 
 0.691), t(116) = 
 2.675, p = 
 0.009, d = 
 0.753. In session two, attractiveness ratings of faces previously paired 
with compliments were significantly higher than those of unfamiliar control faces (M = 
 4.334, SD = 
 0.658 vs 
M = 
 4.144, SD = 
 0.605; t(116) = 
 7.395, p < 
 0.001, d = 
 1.000). Importantly, there was no significant difference in 
attractiveness ratings given for the 10 faces which were not paired with compliments between the two sessions 
(Ms1 = 4.258, SD = 0.691; Ms2 = 4.353, SD = 0.743; t(116) = 1.347, p = 0.181, d = 0.264). Thus familiarity with the 
faces per se is unlikely to have contributed to the difference between ratings given to the familiar faces previously 
paired with compliments as opposed to unfamiliar faces in session 2.
Attractiveness ratings in relation to figurativeness and topic of compliments. 
ANOVA analysis 
on attractiveness ratings in session one revealed main effects of figurativeness (F2,224 = 
 6.756, p = 
 0.002, 
ηp
2 = 
 0.891) and topic (F1,112 = 
 17.029, p < 
 0.001, ηp
2 = 
 0.983) (see Fig. 1). The faces paired with novel metaphorical 
compliments relative to literal ones (p = 
 0.005) and compliments on a woman’s appearance relative to her posses-
sions (p < 
 0.001) were rated significantly higher. There were however no statistically significant differences in 
attractiveness ratings between conventional and novel metaphors (p = 
 0.392). Experience of being in love per se 
did not confound the result since in the singles group there was no significant difference between the ratings of 
women who had previously been in a relationship, but were now single (N = 25), and the women who had never 
had a relationship (N = 40), t(65) = 1.091, p = 0.279, d = 0.184).
Significant two-way interactions were found for: figurativeness x relationship (F2,224 = 
 3.755, p = 
 0.025, 
ηp
2 = 
 0.682), and figurativeness x topic (F2,224 = 
 6.594, p = 
 0.002, ηp
2 = 
 0.908). Post hoc comparisons showed that 
women in a relationship had a greater overall preference for figurativeness relative to the single women, although 
this only achieved significance for the novel metaphorical compliments (p = 
 0.018; see Fig. 2). For compliments 
targeting possessions conventional metaphorical compliments were preferred to literal ones (p = 0.002) whereas 
for those targeting appearance the novel metaphorical compliments were preferred to both literal (p = 
 0.002) and 
conventional metaphor ones (p = 0.005) (see Fig. 3a).
There was also significant topic x relationship x conception risk interaction (F1,112 = 
 5.274, p = 
 0.024, 
ηp
2 = 
 0.624). Post-hoc multiple comparisons showed that the men who complimented women’s appearance were 
rated more attractive than those who complimented their possessions by women in a relationship during the high 
conception risk phase but by single women in the low conception risk phase (Relationship + 
 High conception 
risk: Mappearance = 
 4.826, SE = 
 0.156, Mpossessions = 
 4.371, SE = 
 0.136; Single + 
 Low conception risk: 
Mappearance = 
 4.435, SE = 
 0.129, Mpossessions = 
 4.150, SE = 
 0.112). In other words, women’s relationship status and 
conception risk influenced their preference for the topic of men’s compliments (see Fig. 4).
Recognition accuracy calculated at http://memory.psych.mun.ca/models/recognition/ (d’ = 
 0.796 < 
 4.65 sen-
sitivity threshold, C = 
 0.844) indicated a conservative bias that female participants were less likely to identify faces 
as familiar. Indeed, they failed to exhibit recognition memory for the stimulus faces they had viewed and rated for 
attractiveness in session one (hit rate is 32%).

The attraction ratings in session two were also analyzed in order to see if the different types of compliments 
paired with individual faces influenced subsequent attractiveness of these faces when they were presented alone.

Results showed that the attraction ratings for the faces originally paired with compliments on appearance in ses-
sion one were also significantly higher in session two than those on possessions (Mappearance = 
 4.384, SE = 
 0.063;

opposed to literal language (Mnovel metaphor =

 0.069; F2,224 = 
 114.011, p <

interaction (F2,224 =

menting appearance and those paired with conventional metaphors complimenting possessions being rated as 
more attractive (Mnovel metaphor appearance >

Mliteral appearance, ps < 
 0.001; 
 
Mconventional metaphor possessions > 
Mnovel metaphor possessions > 
Mliteral possessions, ps < 
 0.002. See Fig. 3b). The results of 
paired-sample t tests revealed that the difference in attractiveness ratings between novel metaphors and the other 
two forms of figurativeness targeting appearance in session two is significantly higher than in session one (Rating 
difference between novel and conventional metaphor for appearance in session two = 
 1.128 and in session

 0.288, t(116) = 
 6.039, p < 
 0.001). However, no effects of cycle phase were 
found in the second session.
Thus, overall findings in the second session of the study were consistent with the attraction bias generated 
in the first session being maintained, albeit without participants consciously being able to remember the faces. 
Nevertheless, the pattern of effects did differ somewhat between the two sessions suggesting that the presence of

the verbal compliments per se in session 1, but not in session 2, may have had some influence on attractiveness 
ratings given by the two different relationship groups.
Discussion
This preliminary study aimed to explore whether language usage could influence mate selection, which could sup-
port the possibility that language evolution has been driven by sexual selection. This is the first study to directly 
examine a potential evolutionary bias for the usage of different types of linguistic forms. In our experiment a typi-
cal mate selection scenario was created for female participants using male faces of average attractiveness22,23,40,41,43 
which were additionally paired with verbal compliments varying in terms of figurativeness and topic. Using this 
approach differences in attractiveness rating scores should be primarily driven by linguistic variance and topic 
rather than by the faces per se. The findings confirm our hypotheses that in a courtship situation where compli-
ments serve as a sexual display of mate quality, women show a preference for metaphors, particularly novel ones, 
in verbal structure. In agreement with previous studies6–9 we found that the use of metaphorical as opposed to 
prosaic language by men in compliments is perceived by women as indicative of creativity and intelligence. The 
preference observed for metaphorical compliments targeting a woman’s appearance compared to possessions 
may be indicative that this generates greater sexual attraction towards a potential mate. Furthermore, this impact 
of language usage in compliments on attractiveness judgments does not vary with women’s love style attitudes. 
Interestingly, while participants were subsequently unable to remember the faces paired with different types of 
compliments better than chance, when the faces were presented alone, attraction ratings for those previously 
paired with metaphorical compliments continued to be rated as the most attractive. This indicates that the pre-
vious association with such metaphorical compliments resulted in an unconscious attraction bias towards these 
individuals.
Overall, these results support our first hypothesis that men who use metaphorical compliments, particularly 
novel ones, are perceived as more attractive by women than men who produce more prosaic literal compliments. 
Previous studies have revealed that compared with other mate qualities women, in contrast with men, prefer cre-
ativity and intelligence rather than physical attractiveness44–47, and for the compliments used in our current study 
women did indeed perceive those which were figurative as indicating higher intelligence in a man than literal 
expression compliments. Interestingly use of figurative as opposed to literal language in compliments was not 
significantly linked to perceived dominance which is also known to influence male attractiveness. Thus the type 
of language use during interactions with a prospective mate may provide a key indicator of a male’s intelligence 
and creativity although not dominance. We tend to form very rapid impressions about a person’s attractiveness 
in social contexts42 and thus for women, cues from language usage during initial encounters may provide a rapid 
first assessment of a potential mate’s intellectual and creative abilities. The current study deliberately paired ver-
bal compliments with the faces of men of average attractiveness in order to optimize the chances of showing 
an impact of language usage on perceived attractiveness. It therefore remains to be seen whether metaphorical 
language usage would also increase the attractiveness of individuals with either low or high facial attractiveness.
We tried in the current study to control for possible confounding contributions of non-specific factors unre-
lated to language on altered attractiveness ratings. The face stimuli used were deliberately standardized and of 
average attractiveness in order to render them as homogeneous as possible and pairing of faces with specific 
compliment sentences was entirely random across subjects. We found no evidence for increased attractiveness 
ratings of face pictures per se when they were presented for a second time, and therefore more familiar. While 
a previous study has reported that familiarization with unfamiliar faces through repeated exposure can lead to 
increased attraction ratings48, this used a smaller number of faces with more emotive, smiling faces and also a 
longer exposure time with more frequent presentations than in our current study. It could perhaps be argued that 
the differential novelty of the sentences paired with faces in the first session might have in some way resulted in 
the faces associated with them exhibiting increased familiarity/depth of encoding and therefore continuing to 
be rated as more attractive. However, while the faces originally paired with novel metaphors targeting appear-
ance did indeed receive the highest attractiveness ratings in the second session, those paired with conventional 
metaphors were significantly less than for literal expression compliments, despite being more novel. Similarly, 
for compliments targeting possessions, attractiveness ratings for faces associated with novel metaphors became 
significantly less than those for the more familiar conventional ones in session two (see Fig. 4b). Finally, we also 
found no evidence for faces associated with either novel or conventional figurative language compliments being 
better remembered than those paired with literal expressions. We therefore consider that at this stage the most 
parsimonious explanation for our findings is in terms of the impact of the language content of the verbal compli-
ments on attractiveness ratings of the face pictures rather than as a result of factors unrelated to language such as 
differential familiarity/depth of encoding. However, further experiments will be needed to completely disentangle 
all possible contributing factors.
Our second hypothesis that men who complimented women’s appearance as opposed to her possessions 
would be perceived as more attractive is also supported since in both experimental sessions attractiveness ratings 
were higher for the faces of individuals paired with compliments targeting appearance. Since ratings of the gen-
eral social relevance and valence of the compliments targeting possessions as opposed to appearance did not dif-
fer significantly it is unlikely that differences in attraction ratings in the main experiment can simply be explained 
in terms of greater social appropriateness or positivity. The importance of compliment topic can however be 
both gender- and context- dependent49–51. For example, in a same-sex unstructured context women preferred 
compliments on their appearance whereas men preferred them on their sporting performance50. However, our 
study corroborates previous findings that personal appearance is the most preferred target for compliments in 
opposite-sex interactions among Chinese people52,53. Since compliments between the sexes on appearance can 
easily develop into “flirtation”48, they tend to indicate direct sexual intent and are thus likely to provoke reciprocal

compliments by recipients. Moreover, the finding that the impact of novel metaphors is weaker when the compli-
ment topic is less sexually directed might indicate that “sexual selection shapes language’s content more than its 
form”4. Thus we found in session one that compliments on appearance were consistently more effective in increas-
ing attractiveness ratings compared to those on possessions, regardless of the type of language used, although in 
the second session where only faces were viewed this was only the case for individuals previously associated with 
novel metaphor usage. Possibly novel metaphors targeting appearance might be viewed as particularly “flirta-
tious” relative to conventional ones, although this would require verification.
Our third hypothesis that the observed attraction bias for the figurativeness or topic of compliments would 
be greater during the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle was only partially supported. High conception risk 
greatly increased men’s attractiveness in the eyes of women in a relationship if appearance was praised, although 
there was a tendency for them to find men who complimented their appearance more attractive across the whole 
cycle. For the single women on the other hand this preference was exhibited only by those with a low conception 
risk. The finding for women in a relationship possibly indicates their extra-pair interest when fertile, i.e. for the 
sake of promoting good genes in their offspring, and thus they show greater attraction for males other than their 
partners with qualities indicative of having good genes when near ovulation54,55. However, the single women with 
high conception risk showed equivalent preference for the men who paid compliments regardless of topic. This 
suggests that when the single women were in their fertile phase they were not particularly sensitive to the type of 
compliment given. Possibly this may reflect a tendency to view men who pay any compliments to women as being 
more likely to show sexual interest in them. On the other hand during the luteal phase when there is no likelihood 
of conception, and sexual interest is reduced, then they are more selective and compliments targeting appearance 
become more salient and attractive to them.
Although relationship status influenced the impact of menstrual cycle phase on the attractiveness of compli-
ments, our overall findings showed that attractiveness judgments exhibited a very similar preference pattern for 
metaphors in both the singles and relationship groups. The only significant difference between the groups was 
that women in a relationship gave slightly higher ratings than single women did to novel metaphorical compli-
ments in session one, although not in session two. This might suggest that women in a relationship paid more 
attention to the verbal compliments presented in session one than single women did. This conclusion is supported 
by a previous study showing that women in a relationship showed a greater attentional bias to flirtatious courtship 
distractors than single women did56. Single women generally exhibited less sensitivity towards compliment topic 
and form than the women in relationship, particularly in terms of the preference for novel metaphors.
The fact that Pragma (practical) and Storge (friendship-based) love style attitudes constituted 59.65% and 
45.61% of the participants in our study may reflect both the participants’ sex57,58 and Chinese culture59. This 
finding is consistent with the report that Chinese women, relative to their western counterparts, view love as a 
companionship and place marriage over love59–61. Since few correlations were found between the language types 
of compliments and love attitudes, the preference for use of figurative language in courtship may extend across 
all love styles and not be modulated by whether individuals exhibit a more pragmatic or romantic love style. 
However, this would need to be investigated in more detail in a future larger study.
Importantly, the findings in the current study support the view that an attraction bias towards individuals 
using figurative language for paying compliments is essentially an unconscious one. Thus the female participants 
in the study provided no overt evidence of improved recognition memory for such individuals or the actual com-
pliments they used, but nevertheless exhibited an attraction bias towards them when presented with their face 
pictures alone. This is consistent with other research demonstrating the power of “first impressions” where altered 
behavioral preferences for face pictures of individuals paired with verbal statements about their attributes also 
failed to result in their subsequently becoming more memorable42. Thus both language use and information about 
an individual’s personal attributes can profoundly alter their perceived attraction, but without someone neces-
sarily being consciously aware of their bias towards them. This is similar in many ways to the influence of “sexual 
imprinting” where individuals exhibit a learned, but unconscious, attraction bias either towards (positive), or 
against (negative) specific visual or odor characteristics associated with an opposite sex parent or caregiver62,63.
There are some limitations for this preliminary study. Firstly, we did not carry out hormone assays to confirm 
the accuracy of estimations based purely on menstruation dates and self-reported cycle length. Additionally, a 
within-subject design where women were tested twice at different stages of their cycle may have been more effec-
tive in demonstrating menstrual cycle effects. Secondly, in terms of demonstrating effects of relationship status 
we combined data from single individuals who had both no experience of previous love relationships and those 
who had had the experience in the past. While we found no significant difference between these two types of indi-
viduals in terms of attraction ratings we cannot rule out the possibility that prior love experience might have had 
some effects. Finally, the current study also only included possessions and facial appearance as compliment topics 
and further studies need to investigate a wider range of targets including both visual and personality attributes as 
well as cultural influence64 and flirtatiousness of language usage48.
In summary the current study has provided preliminary experimental support for the possibility that language 
evolution in terms of figurativeness may have been influenced by its role in signaling reproductive fitness in the 
context of mate selection. Future more extensive studies are required to explore this intriguing possibility more 
fully.
Methods
Participants. 
Participants were 124 heterosexual female college students (mean age = 
 20.69 years, SD = 
 2.07) 
were recruited from different majors at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China. All partic-
ipants were experiencing regular, natural menstrual cycles with none taking oral contraceptives. A total of 8 par-
ticipants were excluded after being identified as statistical outliers by SPSS in terms of either very short response 
times (mean < 
 1 s; N = 
 2) or giving very low attraction ratings indicative of considering the stimuli to be very

unattractive (N = 
 6). Thus finally the data from a total of 116 female participants were analyzed (Mage = 
 20.64, 
SD = 
 2.07). In this experiment, a continuous average conception probability employing both forward and back-
ward calculation methods was used to classify conception risk: “high conception risk” (with the conception prob-
ability ≥ 
0.07) vs. “low conception risk” (with the conception probability < 
0.07)65,66. According to relationship 
status and menstrual cycle information, female participants were stratified into relationship (in-relationship 
duration of ≥ 
3 months) or single groups (individuals with no previous relationship experience or who had had 
a relationship that had broken up at least 3 months previously – mean = 
 11.42 months, SD = 
 13.18) with high or 
low conception risk.
Participants first completed Chinese versions of the following questionnaires: EQ67, Beck Depression 
Inventory (BDI68), Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale-Chinese (MCSDS-C69), Social Esteem Scale 
(SES70), Love Attitude Scale (LAS71). The LAS has high validity among Chinese people with subscale Cronbach 
alpha values between 0.706 and 0.81857,58, Passionate Love Scale (PLS72). Participants also provided demographic 
information including age, years of education, romantic relationship status and menstrual cycle (see Table 1).
The present study had full ethical approval from the local ethics committee at the University of Electronic 
Science and Technology of China and in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Every participant 
signed informed consent forms before the experiment, and was paid 40 CNY and briefly interviewed at the end 
of experiment.
Experimental Stimuli
Verbal stimuli. 
A total of 163 verbal compliments were generated by an independent sample (36 males and 
9 females), targeting five parts of either a woman’s face (appearance) or her house (possessions): eyes or win-
dows, lips or door, hair or roof, face or house, smile or garden. Each sentence was matched across all conditions 
for length (average length = 
 9.6 characters, range: 9–10 characters) and word frequency (mean = 
 161831.43, 
SD = 
 47021.91) according to CCL Corpus (version: contemporary Chinese) provided online by Center for 
Chinese Linguistics PKU at http://ccl.pku.edu.cn:8080/ccl_corpus. All the sentences were categorized into three 
kinds of figurativeness (novel metaphor, conventional metaphor, or literal expression) and two topics (appearance 
or possessions), thus resulting in 6 compliment conditions: novel metaphor on appearance (nma), conventional 
metaphor on appearance (cma), literal expression on appearance (lea), novel metaphor on possessions (nmp), 
conventional metaphor on possessions (cmp) and literal expression on possessions (lep). For example, Your eyes 
are morning dew or Your smile is a naughty goblin is from the category of conventional metaphors on appearance; 
Your roof is a lover’s shoulder or Your garden is the sea of flowers belongs to the category of novel metaphors on 
possessions; Your lips are so sexy or Your door is very strong are literal expressions. All sentences were rated using 
7-point Likert scales by two independent samples. The first sample (38 female undergraduates, mean age = 19.58 
years, SD = 
 1.55) rated the content and appropriateness of the sentences in terms of figurativeness, familiarity, 
appropriateness, valence, imageability, language attractiveness, and interpersonal attractiveness (how attractive 
and appropriate they are rated generally in an interpersonal context)16,73. The second sample (41 female under-
graduates, mean age = 
 20.71 years, SD = 
 1.71; 19 high and 22 low-conception risk) rated the sentences in terms of 
the characteristics of the male using them i.e. how dominant or intelligent.
Verbal compliments rated higher than 4 in figurativeness but lower than 4 in familiarity were categorized into 
the group of novel metaphors whereas conventional metaphors were those rated higher than 4 in both figura-
tiveness and familiarity. Literal expressions were those for which figurativeness was rated lower than 3. One-way 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc Bonferroni tests were used to examine group differences statistically 
(see Supplementary Table S1). There was no difference in the interpersonal attractiveness of the different compli-
ments in the experiment itself which focused primarily on the attractiveness of verbal compliments in the context 
of social communication rather than in terms of linguistic attractiveness per se. Consequently, the sixty verbal 
compliments used were balanced in accordance with the seven different criteria and assigned randomly to 60 
different male faces. As a control, a further 10 faces were not paired with verbal stimuli.
Face stimuli. 
A total of 170 color photographs of male students taken on the day of enrollment were obtained, 
after informed consent from all subjects at the Registration Office for National College English Tests. The pictures 
were pre-processed with Photoshop CS6.0 (Adobe System Inc.) to standardize them by removing hair, covering 
visible clothing and changing the background color to black. The color contrast, brightness, pixels number and 
size were unified as well. Overall the objective was to produce average attractiveness faces which were uniform in 
appearance and therefore as homogeneous as possible in term of visual cues which might additionally influence 
attractiveness ratings.
Emotional valence and facial attractiveness were pre-rated from 1 (strongly unattractive) to 9 (strongly attrac-
tive) by 15 females who did not participate in the experiment (mean age = 19.51 years, SD = 0.88). One hundred 
and forty face pictures with 3.5–4.5 attractiveness ratings were selected as facial stimuli, and randomly catego-
rized into two groups: experiment faces (Mattractiveness = 
 4.151, SD = 
 0.297; Mvalence = 
 5.064, SD = 
 0.240) and control 
faces (Mattractiveness = 
 4.198, SD = 
 0.287; Mvalence = 
 5.017, SD = 
 0.256). No group differences were found for either 
facial attractiveness, t (138) = 
 − 
0.945, p = 
 0.346 or valence, t (138) = 
 1.128, p = 
 0.261. Next, the 70 experiment 
faces were each randomly paired either with one of the verbal compliments (i.e. 6 categories with 10 faces in each) 
or nothing (10 faces).
Experimental procedures. 
On the day of experiment, the female participants first completed all the ques-
tionnaires and then sat at a comfortable distance to a computer display on which stimuli were presented with 
Eprime 2.0. They were told that each of these male participants had been asked to write down a complimentary 
sentence after imagining a first visit to a future girlfriend’s house. The experiment consisted of two sessions with 
 www.nature.com/scientificreports/
9
Scientific RepoRts | 7:40871 | DOI: 10.1038/srep40871
one immediately following the other. Face stimuli in the first session were paired with the 60 different compli-
ments or displayed alone (n = 10) in a random sequence for each individual participant (i.e. full randomization). 
In the second session all the faces shown in session one and an additional 70 novel faces were also shown in a 
different random sequence for each participant. In both sessions random sequences were generated using Eprime. 
The first session lasted for about 10 minutes with a maximum of 5 s allowed to make attractiveness ratings from 1 
(very unattractive) to 9 (very attractive) for each of the 70 male face photographs which were either paired with a 
verbal compliment (n = 60) or presented alone (n = 
 10). In the second session, the same 70 faces were presented 
again but without verbal compliments and randomly intermixed with an additional 70 novel control faces. After 
each picture participants were required to first rate the attractiveness of the individual (1–9 – up to 5 s to make a 
response) and next to judge whether they were familiar or not (i.e. had the participants seen them during session 
1 or not). Finally, participants were asked to write down if they remembered any aspect of the verbal compliment 
associated with familiar faces. There was no time limit for the familiarity judgment and compliment content com-
ponents of the task. See Fig. 5 for an example of trials in the two sessions.
Data analysis. 
All categories of ratings are normally distributed or log transformed to normal distribution 
according to Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (ps > 
 0.262). Pearson correlation was used to explore potential associa-
tions between attraction ratings and questionnaire scores. For the 60 experiment faces paired with compliments 
in session one a repeated ANOVA in SPSS 21.0 was used to analyze the factorial design of 2 topics (appearance vs. 
possessions) × 3 figurativeness (novel metaphor vs. conventional metaphor vs. literal expression) × 2 relationship 
status (in relation vs. single) × 2 conception risk (high vs. low). In session two when only faces were presented, 
the faces shown in session 1 (familiar) were stratified into the same 6 groups according to the compliment topic 
and figurativeness they had originally been paired with. Attractiveness rating data in the two sessions were ana-
lyzed using paired t-tests to: 1) compare ratings of the experiment faces shown without compliments in the two 
sessions to assess potential familiarity effects and 2) compare the ratings in session one between faces paired with 
compliments and those shown alone and compare the ratings in session 2 between faces originally paired with 
compliments and novel control faces in order to assess the impact of the verbal compliment on ratings, and 3) 
compare the difference between novel metaphors and the other two forms of figurativeness targeting appearance 
in session one with the counterparts in session two. Multiple comparisons were all Bonferroni corrected with 
p < 0.05 considered to be significant.
