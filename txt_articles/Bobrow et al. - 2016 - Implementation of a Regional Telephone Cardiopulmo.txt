IMPORTANCE Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) significantly improves survival
from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest but is provided in less than half of events on average.
Telephone CPR (TCPR) can significantly increase bystander CPR rates and improve clinical
outcomes.
OBJECTIVE To investigate the effect of a TCPR bundle of care on TCPR process measures and
outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prospective, before-after, observational study of
adult patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest not receiving bystander CPR before the 9-1-1
call between October 1, 2010, and September 30, 2013.
INTERVENTIONS A TCPR program, including guideline-based protocols, telecommunicator
training, data collection, and feedback, in 2 regional dispatch centers servicing metropolitan
Phoenix, Arizona. Audio recordings of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest calls were audited and
linked with emergency medical services and hospital outcome data.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Survival to hospital discharge and functional outcome at
hospital discharge.
RESULTS There were 2334 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (798 phase 1 [P1] and 1536 phase 2
[P2]) in the study group; 64% (1499) were male, and the median age was 63 years (age
range, 9-101 years; interquartile range, 51-75 years). Provision of TCPR increased from 43.5%
in P1 to 52.8% in P2 (P < .001), yielding an increase of 9.3% (95% CI, 4.9%-13.8%). The
median time to first chest compression decreased from 256 seconds in P1 to 212 seconds in
P2 (P < .001). All rhythm survival was significantly higher in P2 (184 of 1536 [12.0%])
compared with P1 (73 of 798 [9.1%]), with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 1.47 (95% CI,
1.08-2.02; P = .02) in a logistic regression model and an adjusted difference in absolute
survival rates (adjusted rate difference) of 3.1% (95% CI, 1.5%-4.9%). Survival for patients
with a shockable initial rhythm significantly improved in P2 (107 of 306 [35.0%]) compared
with P1 (42 of 170 [24.7%]), with an aOR of 1.70 (95% CI, 1.09-2.65; P = .02) and an adjusted
rate difference of 9.6% (95% CI, 4.8%-14.4%). The rate of favorable functional outcome was
significantly higher in P2 (127 of 1536 [8.3%]; 95% CI, 6.9%-9.8%) than in P1 (45 of 798
[5.6%]; 95% CI, 4.1%-7.5%), with an aOR of 1.68 (95% CI, 1.13-2.48; P = .01) and an adjusted
rate difference of 2.7% (95% CI, 1.3%-4.4%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Implementation of a guideline-based TCPR bundle of care
was independently associated with significant improvements in the provision and timeliness
of TCPR, survival to hospital discharge, and survival with favorable functional outcome.

O
ut-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a major public
health problem in the United States.1 Successful re-
suscitation requires a synchronized set of interdepen-
dent rescuer actions (the “chain of survival”), of which the ini-
tial links are immediate recognition of cardiac arrest and
activation of the emergency response system, early cardio-
pulmonaryresuscitation(CPR)withanemphasisonchestcom-
pressions, and rapid defibrillation.2 Bystander CPR (BCPR) has
been shown to double or even triple survival from OHCA.3-7
Despite decades of public CPR training, in most communities
fewerthanhalfofallindividualswithcardiacarrestreceiveany
BCPR, and bleak survival rates persist.8 In response, both the
American Heart Association2,9 and the Institute of Medicine10
have emphasized the importance of telecommunicators
(9-1-1 call takers and dispatchers) identifying cardiac arrest and
assisting lay rescuers in providing BCPR to improve survival.
The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of
implementing a bundle of care, including a guideline-based
telephone CPR (TCPR) protocol, interactive telecommunica-
tor training, detailed data collection with 9-1-1 call auditing,
and telecommunicator feedback for OHCA, in 2 regional dis-
patch centers serving metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona. We hy-
pothesized that this implementation would be associated with
(1) an increase in TCPR rates, (2) a decreased time to first chest
compression,and(3)anincreasedlikelihoodofsurvivaltohos-
pital discharge and favorable functional outcome.
Methods
Arizona has 6.7 million residents and is composed of 15 coun-
ties with urban, suburban, rural, and wilderness areas.11 In
2004, the Arizona Department of Health Services, in conjunc-
tion with The University of Arizona, emergency medical ser-
vices (EMS) agencies, and hospitals in the state, created the
Save Hearts in Arizona Registry and Education (SHARE) pro-
gram. SHARE was designed to measure the incidence of OHCA
and the effect of public, EMS, and hospital resuscitation
interventions.12 This program and its results have been pre-
viously described in detail.4,12-18
Because OHCA has been designated a major public health
problem in Arizona and because the objective of the SHARE
program is to improve resuscitation quality and increase sur-
vival, the data collected were exempt from the Health Insur-
ance Portability and Accountability Act. Permission to pub-
lish the deidentified patient, 9-1-1 center, EMS agency, and
hospital data was obtained from the Arizona Department of
Health Services’Human Subjects Review Board and The Uni-
versity of Arizona Institutional Review Board. The project is
registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01999036).
Because this project was foremost a public health quality
improvement effort, 2 regional dispatch centers were se-
lected because they collectively serve 30 incorporated dis-
tricts in the metropolitan Phoenix area and cover approxi-
mately two-thirds of Arizona’
s population. Phase 1 (P1) was
from October 1, 2010, through November 6, 2011, in one cen-
ter and from February 1, 2011, through March 14, 2012, in the
other center. The respective phase 2 (P2) start dates were
November 7, 2011, and March 15, 2012. Phase 2 ended Septem-
ber 30, 2013, in both centers. The P1 and P2 periods started on
different dates in the centers because of administrative and
logistic constraints encountered in implementing the
intervention.
Study Population
Thisstudywasaprospective,before-after,observationalanaly-
sis of patients with OHCA entered into the SHARE database.
The study population (Figure) was composed of patients with
an EMS-treated, non–EMS-witnessed OHCA of nontraumatic
origin. Cases were excluded if patients showed evidence of ob-
viousdeathorhaddonotresuscitateorders.Incidentsinmedi-
cal facilities (eg, physician’
s office or nursing home) and inci-
dents in which CPR was started before telecommunicator
instructions were also excluded. In addition, calls with incom-
plete or fragmented audio were excluded from the TCPR pro-
cess analysis. Calls in which CPR was started before telecom-
municator instructions were not excluded for the comparison
of BCPR rates between P1 and P2. Bystander CPR was consid-
ered started if compressions were documented in either TCPR
or EMS data.
Intervention
The TCPR program was designed as a statewide effort to mea-
sure and improve the process of TCPR. Because roughly two-
thirds of the state’
s population (approximately 4 million citi-
zens) reside in metropolitan Phoenix,19 the formal data linkage
(9-1-1 to EMS to hospital) and evaluation were focused here.
The data for this region come from 2 public 9-1-1 emergency
medical dispatch centers, 30 EMS agencies, and 22 cardiac re-
ceiving centers. The dispatch centers had provided prearrival
CPR instructions to callers reporting potential OHCAs; how-
ever, they had not yet adopted guideline-based recommen-
dations for identifying cardiac arrest, training, or quality im-
provement before the intervention. The intervention was a
comprehensive bundle of care based on the latest American
Heart Association9 guidelines for TCPR (http://azdhs.gov
/azshare/911/index.htm).Thebundleincludednovelprotocols,
training modules, case and system-level data collection,
reporting,andfeedbacktoindividualhealthcareprofessionals.

Key Points
Question Was implementation of a guideline-based bundle of
telephone cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) care associated
with increased survival to hospital discharge and favorable
functional outcome after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest?
Findings In this prospective, before-after, observational study,
survival to hospital discharge and favorable functional outcome
increased significantly from 9.1% to 12.0% and from 5.6% to 8.3%,
respectively.
Meaning Guideline-based telephone CPR programs can help
communities improve patient outcomes after out-of-hospital
cardiac arrest.

breaths for all other arrests.9 The protocols direct
telecommunicators to ask the following 2 questions as early
aspossible:(1)“Isthepatientconscious?”and(2)“Isthepatient
breathing normally?” If the answer to both is no, then
telecommunicators are advised to start TCPR instructions
immediately. Live and web-based teaching modules trained
approximately250telecommunicators,focusingonearlyarrest
recognition,identifyingagonalbreathing(gasping),andstarting
prompt, assertive, and continuous TCPR instructions until
professional rescuers assume care (http://ow.ly/Ui7E8). For the
quality improvement aspect of the intervention, OHCA calls
were audited, and system-level performance reports were
providedonkeyprocessmeasures.The9-1-1centersupervisors
providedcase-levelfeedbacktoindividualtelecommunicators
on calls if coaching was needed. There were no other system-
wide interventions to improve EMS or hospital resuscitation
care during the TCPR intervention.
Main Outcome Measures
The main outcome measures were survival to hospital dis-
charge and favorable functional outcome at hospital dis-
charge. Secondary outcomes consisted of the 6 key TCPR pro-
cessmeasures(describedbelow)andacomparisonofTCPRand
overall BCPR rates between P1 and P2.
9-1-1 Data
The investigators developed a web-based data collection tool
to capture relevant information on the telecommunicator to
bystanderinteraction(eAppendixintheSupplement).Thiscall
review and data collection process has been reported in
detail.20 Audio recordings of cardiac arrest calls were col-
lected from 2 regional 9-1-1 centers serving the metropolitan
Phoenix area. These recordings were matched to EMS-
confirmedOHCAreportsthroughcase-specificidentifiers,such
as incident number, incident location, and date and time of the
call. Patient outcomes were obtained directly from participat-
ing hospitals or from the Arizona Office of Vital Records. In-
cident information is entered into the 9-1-1 dispatch centers’
medical computer-aided dispatch systems for telecommuni-
cators to assign emergency response units according to the na-
ture of the call. Calls are assigned specific cardiac arrest codes
when patients are recognized as not conscious and not breath-
ing or not breathing normally.
Quality improvement evaluators were formally trained in
acallevaluationprocessthatresultedinstronginterrateragree-
ment on 6 key performance metrics reported in this study.
These included (1) percentage of TCPR-indicated calls in which
the telecommunicator recognized the need for TCPR, (2) per-
centage of TCPR-indicated calls in which the telecommunica-
tor started TCPR instructions, (3) percentage of TCPR-
indicated calls in which bystanders started TCPR, (4) interval
from call receipt until the telecommunicator recognized the
need for TCPR, (5) interval from call receipt until start of TCPR
instructions, and (6) interval from call receipt until the by-
stander performed the first chest compression.20
The need to perform CPR was indicated in the audio re-
cordings when it was determined the patient was not con-
scious and was not breathing normally. Not breathing nor-
mally was defined as the caller describing either complete
absence of breathing, agonal breathing, or a rapid or slow re-
spiratory rate. Evaluator identification of audible agonal
breaths during audio recording review was considered not
breathingnormally.Telecommunicatorrecognitionoftheneed
for TCPR was indicated when he or she used any of several key
terms in the context of providing CPR instructions (eg, “CPR,
”
“chestcompressions,
”and“compressions”).Cardiopulmonary

resuscitation instructions were defined as any portion of tele-
communicator to bystander communication that detailed the
delivery of chest compressions, rescue breaths, or both. Per-
formance of TCPR was defined as any chest compressions de-
livered to the individual in response to TCPR instructions. If
ventilations occurred without chest compressions, this occur-
rence was not counted as TCPR started.
EMS Data
Emergency medical services data were prospectively col-
lected and entered into an existing Utstein-style database re-
flecting standardized international guidelines for the collec-
tion and reporting of OHCA data.4,12,13 Data elements include
sex, age, location of arrest, bystander-witnessed arrest, pre-
sumed etiology of arrest, EMS dispatch to scene arrival (re-
sponse) interval, whether BCPR was provided, initial prehos-
pital electrocardiographic rhythm, type of EMS protocol
(minimally interrupted cardiac resuscitation vs conventional
basic life support/advanced cardiac life support), prehospital
intubation, whether the patient was transported to a cardiac
receiving center, and clinical outcomes.
Hospital Data
The process for linking EMS and hospital postarrest data has
been previously described in detail.17 Data are cross-
referenced between the first responding fire-based EMS, pri-
vate ambulance transport agencies, and the Arizona Cardiac
Receiving Center Database.4,13,17 Outcome data were cross-
referenced with the Arizona Hospital Discharge Database and
the Arizona Office of Vital Records. Favorable functional out-
come was defined through an in-person interview as a Cere-
bral Performance Category score of 1 (good cerebral perfor-
mance) or 2 (moderate cerebral disability at hospital
discharge).21
Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables were summarized by the median and
range and were compared between the 2 periods (P1 vs P2)
using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Categorical variables were
summarized by the frequency and proportion with 95% Clop-
per-Pearson CIs and were compared between the 2 periods by
either the χ2 test or Fisher exact test. Logistic regression mod-
els were used to compare the survival rates and the rates of
favorable functional outcome between the 2 periods, while ad-
justing for potential confounders. Random effects for the EMS
agencies were included in the models to account for any cor-
relationbetweenindividualscaredforbythesameEMSagency.
The effect of the continuous variable age in the logistic regres-
sion models was examined nonparametrically using penal-
ized thin plate regression splines through the generalized ad-
ditive model and the Akaike information criterion. The logistic
regression model was fitted for all individuals, as well as the
subgroup with a shockable initial rhythm. Adjusted rate dif-
ference (aRD) in any event rates between P1 and P2 was esti-
mated by averaging the predicted difference in event prob-
abilities (P2 vs P1) across all patients using the fitted logistic
model, and a 95% CI for the aRD was obtained by the bias-
corrected and accelerated bootstrap approach. In the process
analysis, the proportion of calls with telecommunicator rec-
ognition of the need for TCPR with TCPR instructions given
or with compressions started was compared between the 2 pe-
riods. To compare the time to (1) telecommunicator recogni-
tion of the need for TCPR, (2) start of TCPR instructions, and
(3) first compression, the generalized log-rank test22 was used
to compare interval-censored and right-censored data. The
software environment R23 and the R packages gamm4,24
interval,25 and Icens26 were used for the analysis. All tests were
2-sided with α = .05.
Results
There were 2334 OHCAs (798 P1 and 1536 P2). Sixty-four per-
cent (1499 of 2334) of the participants were male. The me-
dian age of participants was 63 years (age range, 9-101 years;
interquartile range, 51-75 years). Inclusion and exclusion cri-
teria are shown in the Figure. Table 1 lists outcome measures
and sample characteristics stratified by P1 and P2. Phase 2 had
higher rates of sustained return of spontaneous circulation
(P < .001), survival (P = .045), and favorable functional out-
come (P = .03). The other sample characteristics were similar
between P1 and P2 with the exception of location of arrest and
prehospital intubation.
Survival was higher in P2 (12.0%; 95% CI, 10.4%-13.7%)
than P1 (9.1%; 95% CI, 7.2%-11.4%) (P = .045), yielding a crude
(unadjusted) rate difference of 2.8% (95% CI, 0.3%-5.4%) and
a crude odds ratio (cOR) of 1.35 (95% CI, 1.02-1.80). After con-
trolling for potential confounders and risk measures (Table 2),
the logistic regression model identified a significantly higher
odds of survival in P2 compared with P1 (adjusted odds ratio
[aOR], 1.47; 95% CI, 1.08-2.02; P = .02) and higher survival rate
in P2 (aRD, 3.1%; 95% CI, 1.5%-4.9%). The same was true for
the rate of favorable functional outcome in P2 (8.3%; 95% CI,
6.9%-9.8%) vs P1 (5.6%; 95% CI, 4.1%-7.5%) (P = .03), with a
cOR of 1.50 (95% CI, 1.05-2.13), crude rate difference of 2.6%
(95% CI, 0.5%-4.8%), aOR of 1.68 (95% CI, 1.13-2.48), and aRD
of 2.7% (95% CI, 1.3%-4.4%) (P = .01). The analysis of pa-
tients with a shockable initial rhythm also showed significant
improvement in P2 vs P1: survival was 35.0% (107 of 306) vs
24.7% (42 of 170), with an aOR of 1.70 (95% CI, 1.09-2.65;
P = .02) and an aRD of 9.6% (95% CI, 4.8%-14.4%), and the rate
offavorablefunctionaloutcomewas28.8%(88of306)vs17.1%
(29 of 170), with an aOR of 2.13 (95% CI, 1.28-3.56; P = .004)
and an aRD of 11.9% (95% CI, 4.7%-17.4%) (Table 3). A linear
age effect was satisfactory in all 4 logistic regression models,
and model discrimination was satisfactory, with the area un-
der the receiver operating characteristic curve based on fixed
effects only ranging from 70% to 85%. We conducted a sensi-
tivity analysis of fitting all 4 models reported in Tables 2 and
3 without the “patient transported to a cardiac receiving cen-
ter” variable. There was no notable difference in both the pa-
rameter estimates and the P values for all models. Table 4 com-
pares the TCPR process measures between P1 and P2. The
proportion with TCPR started (both instructions and compres-
sions) increased significantly from P1 (43.5% [321 of 738]) to
P2 (52.8% [746 of 1412]) (P < .001), yielding an RD of 9.3%

(95% CI, 4.9%-13.8%) and an OR of 1.51 (95% CI, 1.26-1.82). The
time to the beginning of TCPR instructions was reduced in P2
compared with P1 (median, 179 vs 205 seconds; P = .004), as
was the time to first compression (median, 212 vs 256 sec-
onds; P < .001).
The BCPR rate was analyzed on a sample of 2755 (adding
in the 421 individuals who had CPR started before telecom-
municator instructions were given but met all other inclu-
sion criteria of the main analysis). The results showed that CPR
was received before EMS arrival in 592 of 958 (61.8%) indi-
viduals in P1 compared with 1200 of 1797 (66.8%) individuals
in P2, yielding an RD of 5.0% (95% CI, 1.2%-8.8%) (P = .006).
Discussion

United States and is among the most time-sensitive medical

care, including increased TCPR rates (from 43.5% to 52.8%), a
reductioninthetimetofirstbystanderchestcompression(from
256 to 212 seconds), and, most important, a 31.8% relative in-
crease in survival (from 9.1% to 12.0%) and a 42.8% relative
increase in favorable functional outcome (from 5.6% to 8.3%).
In addition, we found that BCPR (lay rescuer CPR performed
whether TCPR instructions were given or not) increased from
61.8% to 66.8%. While the proportions of BCPR in our study
were slightly higher than those documented in some investi-
gations, we believe that our method of using both 9-1-1 audio
recordings and EMS first-care reports represents a more com-
prehensive representation of the BCPR intervention than pre-
vious use of either data source alone.
These results suggest that the TCPR bundle, deliberately
implemented and measured as part of a system-wide public
health intervention, was an effective method to increase BCPR
rates and survival on a large scale. This observation is a key
finding because most previous work evaluating the effect of
TCPR has been done in high-performance systems in the set-
ting of strict research randomization protocols, where the in-
vestigators were closely linked to the functioning of the local
systems.39-41 Therefore, our findings add momentum to the
currentliteraturebybeingimplementedintherealworldacross
alargenumberofEMSagenciesandcommunitiesandthusmay
carry optimism that successful implementation is possible in
typical EMS systems.
Our findings highlight the benefit of using an existing 24/7
telecommunication infrastructure and training a small num-
ber of personnel. Therefore, we were able to deploy this strat-
egy across a large metropolitan area with minimal incremen-
tal cost. The improved outcomes in this study suggest that our
approach to implementing a comprehensive TCPR program is
afeasible,efficient,andcost-effectivemethodtoincreaseBCPR
rates and improve outcomes after OHCA.

continuousqualityimprovementprogram)wasassociatedwith
significant improvements in survival (aOR of 1.47 and aRD
of 3.1%) and favorable functional outcome (aOR of 1.68 and
aRD of 2.7%).
Our study has some noteworthy differences from previ-
ous reports. First, our investigation was carried out as part of
a statewide public health cardiac resuscitation program de-
signed to improve all facets of OHCA care. Second, unlike the
previous observational investigations, we specifically col-
lected, audited, and linked each 9-1-1 call with both EMS and
hospital process data (eg, EMS intervals, postarrest targeted
temperature management, and coronary angiography) and
with outcomes. Third, this study demonstrated that it is fea-
sible to measure and benchmark key TCPR metrics and use
these data to improve TCPR process and outcomes.
A limitation of our study is that, while it was a prospec-
tive controlled study (before-after analysis), it was not a ran-
domized clinical trial. We believe that randomization of TCPR
is not ethical given the previous positive randomized clinical
trials. However, even if it could be argued that equipoise still
exists, it is clear that no 9-1-1 emergency dispatch systems
would consent to randomization after full disclosure of the ex-
tant evidence. While we controlled for all known confound-
ers, unknown risk factors could be responsible for our

Invited Commentary
The Resuscitative Power of a Telephone Call
James T. Niemann, MD; Roger J. Lewis, MD, PhD
Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is a major health problem in the
United States. Survival rates vary substantially by geographic
region, ranging from 7% to 40% for patients with cardiac ar-
rest due to ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia
(shockable rhythms) and from 2% to 5% for patients with car-
diac arrest initially found with pulseless electrical activity or
asystole (nonshockable rhythms).1 Overall outcomes have not
substantially improved for
decades, and improvements
in outcomes are made more
difficult by an unexplained
decline in the incidence of
ventricular fibrillation as the
first documented rhythm.
The medical community’
s failure to improve survival and the
rate of return to pre-event quality of life has been highlighted
by a recent report from the Institute of Medicine (IOM), titled
Strategies to Improve Cardiac Arrest Survival: A Time to Act.2
It is indeed time to act.
Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is a “community” event or
catastrophe and logically should include community mem-
bers in efforts to improve outcomes. Early access to profes-
sionalrescuersviaa9-1-1telephonesystemnowexistsinnearly
all municipalities with an emergency medical services (EMS)
system. Accomplishing early access was comparatively easy
compared with the tasks ahead and outlined in the IOM re-
port. The report emphasizes the following strategies: “(1) Es-
tablish a national registry of cardiac arrest in order to monitor
performanceintermsofbothsuccessandfailure,identifyprob-
lems, and track progress. (2) Enhance performance of EMS sys-
tems with emphasis on dispatch-assisted CPR [cardiopulmo-
nary resuscitation] and high-performance CPR. (3) Develop
strategies to improve systems of care within hospital settings
andspecialresuscitationcircumstances.(4)Expandbasic,clini-
cal, translational, and health services research in cardiac ar-
rest resuscitation and promote innovative technologies and
treatments. (5) Educate and train the public in CPR, use of au-
tomated external defibrillators, and EMS-system activation.
(6) Create a national cardiac arrest collaborative to unify the
field and identify common goals to improve survival.”2
Community engagement should include early CPR, as
captured in the fifth of the IOM strategies. This has been a
