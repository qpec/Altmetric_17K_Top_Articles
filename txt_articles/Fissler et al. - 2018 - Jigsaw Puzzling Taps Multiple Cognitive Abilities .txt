Prevention of neurocognitive disorders is currently one of the greatest unmet medical
challenges. The cognitive effects of solving jigsaw puzzles (JPs) have not been studied
so far, despite its frequent use as a leisure activity in all age cohorts worldwide. This
study aimed at closing this gap between a lack of science and a frequent real-world
use by investigating the cognitive abilities recruited by JP as well as the cognitive
benefits of lifetime and 30-day JP experience. A total of 100 cognitively healthy adults
(≥50 years of age) were randomized to either a 30-day home-based JP intervention
(≥1 h/day) plus four sessions of cognitive health counseling (JP group) or four sessions
of cognitive health counseling only (counseling group). We measured global visuospatial
cognition by averaging the scores of eight z-standardized visuospatial cognitive abilities
(perception, constructional praxis, mental rotation, speed, flexibility, working memory,
reasoning, and episodic memory). JP skill was assessed with an untrained 40 piece JP
and lifetime JP experience with retrospective self-report. JP skill was associated with all
assessed cognitive abilities (rs ≥ 0.45, ps < 0.001), and global visuospatial cognition
(r = 0.80 [95% CI: 0.72–0.86], p < 0.001). Lifetime JP experience was associated with
global visuospatial cognition, even after accounting for other risk and protective factors
(β = 0.34 [95% CI: 0.18–0.50], p < 0.001). The JP group connected on average 3589
pieces in 49 h. Compared to the counseling group, they improved in JP skill (Cohen’s
d = 0.38 [95% CI: 0.21–0.54], p < 0.001), but not in global visuospatial cognition
(Cohen’s d = −0.08, [CI: −0.27 to 0.10], p = 0.39). The amount of jigsaw puzzling
was related to changes in global visuospatial cognition within the JP group, only after
accounting for baseline performance (β = 0.33 [95% CI: 0.02–0.63], p = 0.03). In sum,
our results indicate that jigsaw puzzling strongly engages multiple cognitive abilities and
long-term, but not short-term JP experiences could relevantly benefit cognition.

Jigsaw Puzzling and Cognitive Aging
INTRODUCTION
Preventing cognitive decline in aging such as in mild cognitive
impairment and dementia is one of the most relevant medical
needs in our aging society (Winblad et al., 2016). Engagement
in cognitively, physically, and socially demanding activities
is associated with a reduced risk of cognitive decline and
dementia in observational studies (Valenzuela and Sachdev,
2006a,b; Wang et al., 2013). Many hundreds of randomized
controlled intervention trials have been conducted to investigate
the causality of these observational findings. These studies
focused mostly on cognitive training programs (Karbach and
Verhaeghen, 2014; Lampit et al., 2014), video games (Bediou
et al., 2018), and physical exercise such as aerobic exercise and
resistance training (Kelly et al., 2014; Young et al., 2015).
However, the cognitive benefits of many other frequently
performed leisure activities have not been investigated so far. One
example is jigsaw puzzling: alone in Germany, it is estimated that
almost 7 million JPs were sold in 2016, resulting in a market of
€
75 million (Npdgroup Deutschland GmbH, 2016). The jigsaw
puzzle (JP) market in Europe and the United States was in total
more than €
400 million in 2016 (The Npd Group, Inc, 2016; The
Npd Group Inc, 2017)1, almost twice as much as the worldwide
cognitive training market in 2013 (about $220 million; Simons
et al., 2016).
Jigsaw puzzling may provide two active ingredients (i.e.,
effective features) that benefit cognition: first, process-specific
cognitive demands of jigsaw puzzling could contribute to an
increased brain reserve (Gelfo et al., 2018), and second, regulation
of distressing emotions through jigsaw puzzling could prevent
chronic stress states that can exert a negative impact on cognitive
aging and dementia in the long term (Lupien et al., 2009; Wilson
et al., 2011).
Based on a cognitive task analysis, jigsaw puzzling may
demand multiple cognitive abilities including visual perception
(e.g., recognizing objects, patterns, and orientation of lines),
constructional
praxis
(e.g.,
integrating
visual
and
motor
information to assemble pieces), mental rotation (e.g., mentally
rotating piece’
s orientation to fit them to other pieces), cognitive
speed and visual scanning (e.g., sorting puzzle pieces), cognitive
flexibility (e.g., switching attention between different strategies,
between different puzzle pieces, and between puzzle shape,
image, and color), perceptual reasoning (e.g., integrating
different perceptual information to develop strategies and plans
how to solve the puzzle), and working and episodic memory
(e.g., keeping the association between spatial location and
visual patterns/images of puzzle pieces in working memory and
long-term memory).
As another potential active ingredient, engaging in jigsaw
puzzling could serve to cope with stressors by regulating
distressing emotions (Hutchinson et al., 2003). This emotion-
focused coping (Folkman and Lazarus, 1980) through JPs can
be subdivided in two leisure coping strategies (Iwasaki and
1NPD data captures roughly 80% of total market penetration. It does not capture
all specialty channel data and other accounts. Copyright 2017. The NPD Group,

Mannell, 2000): first, jigsaw puzzling could depict a leisure
palliative coping (Iwasaki and Mannell, 2000) or in other words
a “
breather” from stress (Lazarus et al., 1980), which may
result from its focused attentional demands that enables a
psychological time out from stressors. Second, jigsaw puzzling
can serve as a mood enhancement through fun, flow, and mastery
experiences.
Despite the frequent use of jigsaw puzzling as a leisure
activity and its potential effects on cognition as a cognitive
demanding activity and emotion-focused coping strategy, the
role of jigsaw puzzling in cognitive aging has not been specifically
investigated in observational and interventional designs so
far.
To our knowledge, there is no randomized controlled trial
on the effects of jigsaw puzzling and only three observational
studies that give hints to the cognitive demands and effects of
jigsaw puzzling. In cognitively healthy children, Dykens (2002)
found strong associations of jigsaw puzzling performance with
a figure copy task and two puzzle-like visuospatial intelligence
tests (rs = 0.59–
0.72). While this study indicates that jigsaw
puzzling is cognitively challenging, two studies provide evidence
for potential cognitive effects. Levine et al. (2012) found a positive
association between the frequency of puzzle play (including
jigsaw puzzling) between 2 and 4 years of age and 2-D spatial
transformation skills at 4.5 years of age. While many studies
demonstrated lifetime cognitive activity as a protective factor
for cognitive aging (Vemuri et al., 2014) and dementia (Lee
et al., 2018), to our knowledge, only one study included jigsaw
puzzling in the composite score of cognitive activity (Friedland
et al., 2001). This study did not report specific results on jigsaw
puzzling.
Here, we aimed to close the science-practice gap between
a lack of research on the cognitive demands and effects of
jigsaw puzzling and its frequent use as a leisure activity. First,
we evaluated whether and which visuospatial cognitive abilities
are tapped by solving JPs. Second, we assessed whether lifetime
JP experience is a protective factor for visuospatial cognitive
aging in an observational design. As protective factors found
in observational designs are not manipulated and hence not
necessarily causal (National Research Council and Institute of
Medicine, 2009), we investigated the impact of a 30-day JP
intervention on visuospatial cognition in a randomized, assessor-
blinded, controlled clinical trial. Finally, we aimed at revealing
a dose-response relationship between the amount of jigsaw
puzzling and visuospatial cognitive improvement within the JP
group.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The observational study and randomized, controlled, assessor-
blinded superiority trial with two parallel groups was conducted
from March 1 to September 12, 2016, at Ulm University,
Germany. The study protocol article on the randomized
controlled trial has been published2 (Fissler et al., 2017), the study

Jigsaw Puzzling and Cognitive Aging
was preregistered3, and the CONSORT Checklist is provided in
Supplementary Table S1.
Procedure
The Ethics Committee of Ulm University approved the study.
We described the methods in more detail in the study protocol
(Fissler et al., 2017). All participants gave written informed
consent prior to participation and received 40€ as financial
compensation. We recruited participants via newspaper articles
and flyers. Eligibility was assessed in a telephone-based pre-
screening (t1) and an on-site screening at Ulm University before
the pretest assessment (t2). Eligible participants completed a
1.5-h pretest. Subsequently, we provided a 15-min cognitive
health counseling and disclosed the group allocation. The 30-
day intervention period started within 2 weeks after the pretest.
During the intervention period, all participants were contacted
via telephone three times (t3–
t5). After the intervention, the
posttest (t6) was scheduled within 2 weeks.
Eligibility Criteria
Inclusion criteria were a minimum age of 50 years, low JP
experience within the past 5 years (<5 completed JPs), interest
in solving JPs, commitment of spending 30 h with solving JPs,
intact vision and motor function of the upper extremities, and
unimpaired cognition [Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE;
Folstein et al., 1975) ≥ 24]. Exclusion criteria were self-reported
psychiatric, neurologic, or other diseases potentially influencing
changes in cognitive performance and current participation in
another intervention study.
Interventions
Participants were randomly allocated to solving JPs plus cognitive
health counseling (JP group) or cognitive health counseling only
(counseling group).
Cognitive Health Counseling
Participants received general information about modifiable
lifestyle risk and protective factors for cognitive decline and
dementia such as cognitive, physical, and social activity and
nutrition (session 1 at t2). In the telephone calls during the
intervention period, we gave individual feedback regarding
potential changes in risk and protective factors based on
participants’individual lifestyle (session 2 at t3). As the last
behavioral change strategy, we monitored behavior changes by
asking participants for changes in the respective lifestyle domains
(sessions 3 and 4 at t4 and t5).
Jigsaw Puzzle Intervention
The JP group was instructed to solve JPs at home (30 days within
5 weeks, ≥1 h/day). The first JP was standardized (Beautiful
Prague, 300 pieces; by Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH, RSV),
while all subsequent JPs were freely selected by the participants
(200–
1500 piece JPs). However, we encouraged participants
to increase difficulty of the JPs by increasing the number of
pieces per JP as long as this did not reduce their pleasure and
3https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02667314
fun. Recommendations were based on JP performance (time
per connected piece) and participants’reports about perceived
difficulty, challenge, pleasure, and fun that were assessed in each
of the three telephone interviews (Fissler et al., 2017). To monitor
protocol adherence closely, participants received a diary and
were asked to fill it out immediately after each session. For
each intervention day, participants were supposed to note the
respective JP name, duration, and optional comments about their
puzzle experience. After each of three cognitive health counseling
sessions (t3−5), participants had to report their diary entries via
telephone.
Randomization and Blinding
We applied stratified, blocked randomization with two age bands
(50–
64 years; ≥65 years) and two cognitive status bands (MMSE:
24–
27; 28–
30). We randomly allocated participants to the two
groups in each stratum in blocks of four with a 1:1 allocation
ratio. An author uninvolved in data collection (LL) generated
the allocation sequence4, which was concealed in numbered
envelopes for each stratum.
The staff involved in enrollment (OK, PF, and DL), assessment
(DL and HA), and on-site cognitive health counseling (OK and
PF) were blind to group assignment, which was disclosed to
participants after on-site counseling (OK and PF). They were
instructed verbally and in a written and signed form not to
disclose group assignment to the outcome assessors. However,
two participants disclosed group assignment before completion
of the primary outcome assessment of the posttest.
Outcomes
Primary and Secondary Outcomes
As primary outcome, a composite score representing global
visuospatial
cognition
was
created
by
averaging
eight
z-standardized
domain
scores:
visual
perception
(adapted
from Benton’
s Judgment of Line Orientation Test; Benton
et al., 1994), visuospatial processing speed and flexibility
(Trail Making Test part A and B; Reitan, 1958; Welsh et al.,
1994), visuospatial working memory (Visual Memory Span,
Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised, German edition; Härting
et al., 2000), constructional praxis and visuospatial episodic
memory (Rey Complex Figure Test; Osterrieth, 1944), mental
rotation [adapted version of the Mental Rotations Test–
Letters
(Neuburger et al., 2011) and Mental Rotations Test A (Peters
et al., 1995)], and visuospatial reasoning (Block Design, Wechsler
Adult Intelligence Scale–
III, German edition; Von Aster et al.,
2006). As pre-defined in the study protocol (Fissler et al., 2017),
ability scores with skewness over |1| were Blom-transformed
(Blom, 1958; Ball et al., 2002) in order to minimize ceiling and
floor effects and increase reliability (retest reliability without
transformation, r = 0.88; with transformation, r = 0.90).
Other Measures
We assessed age, gender, education, and profession in an
interview. Adverse events were recorded at the telephone calls
(t3–
t5) and the posttest (t6).

Fissler et al.
Jigsaw Puzzling and Cognitive Aging
We asked for modifiable lifestyle risk and protective
factors for dementia, among others cardiovascular risk factors,
Mediterranean diet (Martínez-González et al., 2012), and the
number of recently performed cognitive, physical, and social
activity types (Challenging Leisure Activities Questionnaire,
based on the CHAMPS Physical Activity Questionnaire for Older
Adults; Stewart et al., 2001).
We assessed JP skill as the average time per connected piece for
frame and inner parts of a 40 piece JP (Rothenburg ob der Tauber,
by RSV). Within the JP group, we also assessed the self-reported
time for solving the first 300 piece JP in the intervention for an
additional analysis (Beautiful Prague, by RSV).
Participants retrospectively rated their lifetime experience in
solving JPs from 1 (none) to 5 (very high) and estimated the time
spent with solving JPs over the lifetime from 1 (<50 h) to 5
(>350 h) and the number of connected JP pieces from 1 (<2000
pieces) to 5 (>8000 pieces). The mean of all three ratings served
as measure of lifetime JP experience.
The average of the z-standardized time spent with solving JPs
and of the number of completed JP pieces during the intervention
period served as a measure of the amount of solving JPs.
Participants
subjectively
estimated
the
effects
of
the
interventions at the last telephone interview (t5) before the
posttest (t6). They were asked whether they expected that
their performance in the visuospatial cognitive tests at the
posttest would be positively influenced (yes or no) and to
estimate how their performance would change from pretest
to posttest from 1 (improve markedly) to 5 (decline markedly).
Both questions were also asked regarding JP skill. After
primary outcome assessment at the posttest, we asked the
participants how motivated they were while performing the
visuospatial cognitive tests from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very
much).
Statistical Analysis
G∗Power and the R software package were used for statistical
analyses (Faul et al., 2007; R Development Core Team, 2015).
We calculated the power to detect associations with medium
effect size (r = 0.30) and intervention effects with small effect
size (f = 0.10), given a retest correlation of 0.90 for the
primary outcome and a two-sided α-error of 0.05. The power
to detect intervention effects was approximately 99%. The power
to detect associations of the primary outcome with the amount
of solving JPs was 60%, and with both JP skill and lifetime JP
experience 87%.
Associations were evaluated with linear regression analyses
(visuospatial cognition and lifetime JP experience, amount
of
jigsaw
puzzling
and
visuospatial
cognitive
change)
or
Pearson
correlations
(visuospatial
cognition
and
JP
skill).
Intervention effects were assessed with linear mixed effects
models with time and group as fixed effects and subject as random
intercept in a modified intention-to-treat analysis (all participants
with follow-up data). Cohen’
s d served as effect size measure.
Analyses regarding the eight secondary outcomes and the two
dosage parameters (JP pieces and time) were adjusted for multiple
comparisons using Holm’
s method.
RESULTS
From March 1 to August 3, 2016, we screened 168 interested
adults for eligibility, of which 100 participants (64 women, 36
men) were included into the study (see Figure 1). Data collection
was completed on September 12, 2016. Forty individuals
refused study participation after detailed study information,
28 participants did not meet eligibility criteria. Out of 100
included adults, 52 were randomized to the JP group and 48
to the counseling group. One participant was lost to follow-
up.
Baseline demographic (age, gender, education) and cognitive
characteristics (MMST, global visuospatial cognition) in the two
groups were well balanced and differences were below a small
effect size (Cohen’
s d ≤ |0.19| ; see Supplementary Table S2).
Association Between Visuospatial
Cognition and Jigsaw Puzzle Skill
Jigsaw puzzle skill, as measured with an untrained 40 piece JP,
was highly associated with global visuospatial cognition (r = 0.80,
p < 0.001, see Figure 2) and with all eight visuospatial cognitive
abilities (rs ≥ 0.45, ps < 0.001; see Supplementary Table S3).
Similarly, self-reported time to complete the 300 piece JP was
associated with global visuospatial cognition (r = 0.70, p < 0.001)
and with all eight visuospatial cognitive abilities (rs ≥ 0.29,
ps < 0.04; see Supplementary Results S1 and Supplementary
Table S3).
Association Between Global Visuospatial
Cognition and Lifetime Jigsaw Puzzle
Experience
Lifetime JP experience was associated with global visuospatial
cognition at baseline (β = 0.51, p < 0.001, see Figure 3) and with
all eight visuospatial cognitive abilities (βs ≥ 0.28, ps ≤ 0.008;
see Supplementary Table S4). Importantly, the associations
with global visuospatial cognition, and two secondary outcomes
(visuospatial reasoning and cognitive flexibility) remained
significant after accounting for the known risk and protective
factors age, education, and the number of recently performed
social, physical, and cognitive activity types (βs ≥ 0.32, ps ≤ 0.004;
see Supplementary Tables S4, S5).
Intervention Effects
Jigsaw puzzle skill improved significantly in the JP group
compared to the counseling group (Cohen’
s d = 0.38 [95%
CI: 0.21–
0.54], F (97) = 20.43, ps ≤ 0.001). However, the
primary outcome global visuospatial cognition and all secondary
outcomes did not show significant group × time interactions
(see Figure 4 and Table 1). From pretest to posttest, both
groups improved in global visuospatial cognition, mental
rotation, processing speed, cognitive flexibility, and episodic
memory (Cohen’
s d ≥ 0.20; ps ≤ 0.05). The JP group also
improved in reasoning (Cohen’
s d = 0.20, p = 0.02). The
supportive per-protocol analysis and pre-defined additional
analyses that accounted for confounding variables yielded
consistent results.

bcompleted at least three of four cognitive health counseling sessions, and cparticipants reported solving jigsaw puzzles in the intervention period.
Dose–Response Relationship
Despite the lack of an effect of the JP intervention, compared
to the counseling group, on visuospatial cognition, the dose–
response analysis revealed an association of the change in
global visuospatial cognition from pretest to posttest with the
amount of jigsaw puzzling and with the number of connected
JP pieces within the JP intervention, only after accounting for
baseline performance to adjust for the regression-to-the-mean
effect [β = 0.33, p = 0.03, and β = 0.43, p(Holm corrected) = 0.03,
respectively, see Figure 5 and Supplementary Table S6].
A post hoc analysis that removed one influential data point of a
participant with a very high amount of jigsaw puzzling revealed
a robust dose–
response relationship with an even increased effect
size for the primary outcome (β = 0.39, p = 0.01).
Based on the linear model parameters of the dose–
response
analysis and the observed pretest–
posttest gains in the counseling
group, we estimate that individuals would need to connect 9108
JP pieces to induce gains in global visuospatial cognition of
medium size (Cohen’
s d = 0.5).
Assessment of Opportunity Costs and
Placebo Effects
The counseling group increased the number of performed
cognitive, physical, and social leisure activity types (excluding

along with a reduced potential of gain from other activity types
(opportunity costs). Thus, the use of a counseling control group
efficiently accounted for such opportunity costs.
Placebo effects may be induced through differences in
expectations,
test
motivation,
and
randomization-related
disappointment. Participants’
expectations about improvements
in cognitive test performance were higher in the JP group
than in the control group (76 vs. 33%, p < 0.001). Despite this
group difference, expectations that performance will improve
in the visuospatial tests from pre-to-posttest were positive in
the control group (p < 0.001, Cohen’
s d = 0.62). Furthermore,
expectations were not related to the amount of solving JPs within
the JP group (see Supplementary Results S2 for more details).
Most importantly, expectations were not related to actual
cognitive changes and statistically accounting for expectations
did not alter group effects and dose–
response relationships (see
Supplementary Results S2).
Test motivation at posttest did not differ significantly between
the groups and was not related to the amount of solving JPs
within the JP group (see Supplementary Results S3). Taken
together, the counseling group controlled for the potential gains
from alternative activity types, test motivation, and practice
effects, but only partly for expectations of cognitive gains.
Statistically accounting for expectations did not change our
findings and expectations were not related to objective cognitive
changes. Therefore, we efficiently took opportunity costs into
account and potential placebo effects seemed not to have affected
our results.
Adverse Events
The total number of adverse events did not differ significantly
between the groups. The number of adverse events probably due
to the intervention were all temporarily, but were significantly
higher in the JP group, compared to the control group (n = 11 vs.
n = 0, p = 0.005). These events included back and shoulder pain
(n = 4), loss of motivation in puzzling (n = 3), “
craving”to solve
JPs (n = 3), and uncommon headache (n = 1; Supplementary
Results S4 and Supplementary Table S7).
DISCUSSION
Principal Findings
We found that JP skill was highly associated with global
visuospatial cognition and all measured visuospatial cognitive
abilities indicating that solving JPs strongly taps multiple
visuospatial
cognitive
processes
including
perception,
constructional
praxis,
mental
rotation,
speed,
flexibility,
working memory, reasoning, and episodic memory. This result
is in line with a study with cognitively healthy children that
found strong correlations (rs > 0.5) of JP performance with a
figure copy task and two visuospatial intelligence tests that were
structurally similar to jigsaw puzzling (Dykens, 2002).
We revealed that self-reported lifetime JP experience was
associated with visuospatial cognition in healthy adults above 50
years of age, even after accounting for known predictive factors
for cognitive aging. However, this association may be due to an
effect of jigsaw puzzling on cognition, vice versa, or due to non-
measured confounding variables (e.g., people who solve more JPs
may play more games in general). Our results are in line with
two observational studies in children (Levine et al., 2012) and
older adults (Friedland et al., 2001) that found an association of
cognitive outcomes with activity composite scores that included
jigsaw puzzling.
Thirty days of solving JPs improved JP skill in an untrained
JP, but did not improve global visuospatial cognition, in
comparison to the counseling group, in a clinically relevant
way. Both groups improved in global visuospatial cognitive

performance, which may reflect practice effects through repeated
testing, true cognitive benefits in both groups, or a mixture
of both. Cognitive benefits have been regularly found in both
experimental and active control conditions of intervention
studies without significant differences between groups. These
results have often been interpreted as true intervention effects
in both groups (e.g., Erickson et al., 2011; Barnes et al., 2013;
Ballesteros et al., 2017). However, practice effects should not be
underestimated, especially with regard to episodic memory tests
as subjects know about the delayed recall trial at the second
testing (Woods et al., 2006).
Finally, we found a marginally significant dose–
response
association between the amount of jigsaw puzzling and
improvement in visuospatial cognition within the puzzle group
that turned significant after accounting for baseline cognition.
This association supports the interpretation that cognitive test
improvements in the JP group were at least partly due to true
cognitive gains. Assuming that our estimated model parameters
of this association are true, the association was fully due to an
effect of jigsaw puzzling on cognition, we expect that at least
∼9100 JP pieces need to be connected for clinically relevant
cognitive gains, in contrast to the control group (Cohen’
s d = 0.5).
Implications
Jigsaw puzzling recruits multiple visuospatial cognitive abilities
and is a potential protective factor for cognitive aging.

Fissler et al.
Jigsaw Puzzling and Cognitive Aging
strengthen the evidence that cognitively demanding activities
benefit cognition over the long term, but are no “
quick-fix”
solution to improve cognition (Gathercole, 2014). Our findings
are especially important as solving JPs is a frequently performed
and easily applicable leisure activity: it can be executed alone or in
groups at almost all places without the need of technical devices,
language capabilities, or prior knowledge. Given that solving JPs
has no known harms, we think that long-term, but not short-
term jigsaw puzzling can be considered for recommendations
regarding healthy cognitive aging as one component within an
intrinsically motivated, physically, socially and cognitively active
lifestyle.
Strengths, Limitations, and Future
Perspectives
This randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded clinical trial
conforms to best-practice standards of cognitive intervention
trials (Simons et al., 2016). However, there is no consensus
regarding a gold-standard control group (Boot et al., 2013). We
used a counseling group to control for the potential cognitive
benefits through other activity types when solving JPs is chosen
(opportunity costs). In addition, we aimed to control for placebo
effects induced through group differences in test motivation and
expectations about cognitive benefits.
We efficiently accounted for potential opportunity costs, as we
did not use a control group of a theoretically inefficient alternative
activity type and the counseling group engaged in 1.4 more
challenging leisure activity types during the intervention period
than the JP group (excluding solving JPs). However, we cannot
exclude that solving JPs may be superior in inducing cognitive
benefits compared to activities, with no expected influence on
cognition. To evaluate this, future studies could include a second
control condition using a theoretically inefficient activity type
such as watching television (Lindstrom et al., 2005).
We implemented three strategies to prevent placebo effects
due to higher expectations and test motivation in the JP group, as
well as due to disappointment in the control group: first, cognitive
health counseling for the control group; second, verbally
lowering expectations for jigsaw puzzling effects and increasing
expectations for effects through other behavioral changes; and
third, high amount of study staff contact in both groups.
However, we still found higher expectation regarding benefits
in visuospatial cognitive task performance in the JP group than
in the counseling group. Importantly, the counseling group had
significantly positive expectations, statistically accounting for
expectations, did not alter our results, the amount of solving JPs
and the cognitive improvements were not related to expectations,
and finally, test motivation did not differ between groups at
posttest. In behavioral interventions, participants are per se
aware of their behaviors and eliminating group differences in
differentially effective interventions may need stronger verbal
manipulation of expectations or control activities which induce
a mismatch of effects and expectations. To account for potential
effects of randomization-related disappointment on cognitive
change, it should be measured after group assignment in future
trials.
As the choice of tasks is critical for assessing transfer to broad
cognitive abilities, we used a composite measure of multiple
cognitive tests that are structurally dissimilar to jigsaw puzzling.
This should prevent that improvements in task-specific skills
transferred to gains in cognitive tests. While such composite
scores are still the gold standard in measuring broad cognitive
gains (Ngandu et al., 2015), future studies may additionally use
latent difference score models for a secondary analysis strategy
(McArdle, 2009; Schmiedek et al., 2014).
The jigsaw puzzling duration was relatively high with an
average of 49 h within 30 days, in comparison to other
intervention studies (e.g., action video game studies had an
average training duration of 23 h; Bediou et al., 2018). However,
the difference between participants’
amount of jigsaw puzzling
through the intervention is still small when compared with the
differences between participants in the observational study that
investigated the experience across the whole lifetime. Based on
the results of the dose–
response relationship, higher amounts
of jigsaw puzzling (>9100 connected pieces) might have the
potential to induce relevant cognitive benefits. Therefore, future
studies should manipulate the amount of jigsaw puzzling over
longer periods (1–
2 years) to shed light on the causality of the
experience-cognition association (cf., Ngandu et al., 2015).
Finally, future studies should investigate the underlying
mechanisms of the association between long-term jigsaw
puzzling and cognition. First, process-specific cognitive demands
of jigsaw puzzling may induce changes at a cellular level
(synaptogenesis, neurogenesis, gliogenesis, and angiogenesis)
and
molecular
level
(changes
in
neurotransmitters
and
neurotrophins; Gelfo et al., 2018) resulting in a more efficient
neuronal network (McDonough et al., 2015) that better copes
with brain pathological or age-related changes (Stern, 2009).
Second, the potential of jigsaw puzzling to regulate distressing
emotions as a breather (Lazarus et al., 1980) and a mood
enhancement (Iwasaki and Mannell, 2000) may reduce the
negative impact of chronic stress on cognition (Lupien et al.,
2009; Wilson et al., 2011), e.g., by regulating cortisol levels.
Future studies need to investigate these potential mechanisms
of action by assessing physiological parameters such as task-
related brain activity (McDonough et al., 2015) or resting-state
connectivity (Franzmeier et al., 2017), blood-based or hair-based
parameters such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Harb
et al., 2017) or cortisol levels (Koenig et al., 2018). Finally,
cognitively demanding leisure activities such as jigsaw puzzling
may exert their effects not only by increasing brain reserve
but might have the potential to affect brain pathology such as
Alzheimer’
s disease (Landau et al., 2012). Therefore, associations
between lifetime JP experience (next to other leisure activities)
and markers of Alzheimer’
s disease should be investigated.
CONCLUSION
Our findings indicate that jigsaw puzzling recruits multiple
visuospatial cognitive abilities and is a –not necessarily causal –
protective factor for visuospatial cognitive aging. In addition, we
found no evidence that low amounts of jigsaw puzzling over a
