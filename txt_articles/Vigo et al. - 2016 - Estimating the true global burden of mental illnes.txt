Abstract/Summary 
 
We argue that the global burden of mental illness is underestimated and examine the 
reasons for under-estimation to identify five main causes: (i) overlap between 
psychiatric and neurological disorders; (ii) the grouping of suicide and self-harm as a 
separate category; (iii) conflation of all chronic pain syndromes with musculoskeletal 
disorders; (iv) exclusion of personality disorders from disease burden calculations; and 
(v) inadequate consideration of the contribution of severe mental illness to mortality 
from associated causes. Using published data, we estimate the disease burden for 
mental illness to show that the global burden of mental illness accounts for 32·42% of 
years lived with disability (YLDs) and 13·03% of disability adjusted life years (DALYs), 
instead of the earlier estimates suggesting 21·2% of YLDs and 7·07% of DALYS.  
 
Currently used approaches underestimate the burden of mental illness by more than a 
third. Our estimates place mental illness a distant first in global burden of disease in 
terms of YLDs, and level with cardiovascular and circulatory diseases in terms of DALYs.  
The unacceptable apathy of governments and funders of global health must be 
overcome to mitigate the human, social, and economic costs of mental illness.

Introduction 
 
Mental health is defined by the WHO as “a state of well-being in which every individual 
realizes his or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work 
productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to her or his community”.1 
This state, however, is disrupted in one of every three individuals –or more– during their 
lifetimes.2,3  
Worldwide the magnitude of mental illness has been highlighted by studies on the 
global burden of disease.4 Yet, in spite of the very considerable burden and their 
associated adverse human, economic and social impacts, global policy makers and 
funders have so far failed to prioritise treatment and care of people with mental 
illness.5,6 Consequently, people with mental illness worldwide are largely neglected.6 
Pervasive stigma and discrimination7,8 contributes, at least in part, to the imbalance 
between the global burden of disease attributable to mental disorders, and the 
attention these conditions receive. Stigma, embodied in discriminatory social structures, 
policy and legislation, produces a disparity between services geared to physical health 
and mental health, with lower availability, accessibility and quality of services for the 
latter.9  
Globally, rapid economic, demographic, and epidemiological transitions mean a growth 
in populations that are living longer, but with greater morbidity and disability.10–13 
Mental disorders are a major driver of the growth of overall morbidity and disability 
globally.14,15  
Five types of mental illness appear in the top 20 causes of global burden of disease 
(GBD): major depression (2nd), anxiety disorders (7th), schizophrenia (11th), dysthymia 
(16th), and bipolar disorder (17th) were leading causes of years lived with disability in 
2013.11 In this context, this paper aims to: offer a constructive critique of current 
estimates of GBD related to mental illness; argue that in aggregate mental illness is 
underestimated; and explore an alternative approach to produce more realistic GBD 
estimates of mental disorders worldwide. We do not propose a different nosology of 
 4 
 
 
disorders, but aim to better gauge the disease burden of mental illness. An important 
benefit of a new GBD estimation is to inform prioritisation of health needs and resource 
allocation, so our aim is to provide decision makers, who rely on specialists to design 
and implement policies, with a new set of assumptions and tools to produce more 
accurate estimations using existing data. 
 
Burden of mental illness: measurement challenges 
We argue that the burden of mental illness has been underestimated due to five 
reasons: (i) the overlap between psychiatric and neurological disorders; (ii) the grouping 
of suicide and behaviours associated with self-injury as a separate category outside the 
boundary of mental illness; (iii) the conflation of all chronic pain syndromes with 
musculoskeletal disorders; (iv) the exclusion of personality disorders in mental illness 
disease burden calculations; and (v) inadequate consideration of the contribution of 
severe mental illness to mortality from associated causes.  
 
We discuss each of these measurement issues and methodological considerations. 
Diagnostic classifications such as the ICD-10 system present challenges: they need to 
consider both the clinical syndrome and the aetiology of each disorder, with the goal of 
providing a system that is meaningful at the individual explanatory and therapeutic 
levels, considering the presentation of the illness as well as its natural history. Further, 
ICD-11, which is currently under development and is due to be approved by the World 
Health Assembly, is identified by the Advisory Group for ICD-11 as a better tool for 
reducing burden of mental illness, but without specific mention of improvements in the 
estimation of global disease burden related to mental disorders as a goal for the 
revision. 16 
 
The GBD estimation framework uses a comprehensive, mutually exclusive hierarchical 
list of disorders based on the ICD-10 classification mainly for two reasons: (a) to take 
advantage of a common nosologic language, and (b) to account for 100% of the disease 
 5 
 
 
burden without double counting (see Appendix Box 1). But GBD differs from nosologic 
systems: instead of the individual level, it is mainly concerned with the population level; 
and instead of informing individual aetiology and therapy, it needs to allow for a better 
understanding of disease distribution and transitions, in order to guide prioritization of 
population health needs and organization of health services.  
The actual grouping of disorders used by the GBD – a hierarchical cause list comprising 
four levels of aggregation – is sometimes based on clinical grounds (such as with 
Cardiovascular and Circulatory conditions, a level 2 aggregation), and sometimes on a 
mix of disease or anatomical criteria (such as Diabetes, Urogenital, Blood and Endocrine 
disorders, also level 2).17 Consideration of more pertinent criteria for aggregation is 
warranted (Appendix Box 1).  
 
The psychiatric-neurological interface 
Traditionally, disorders both affecting the central nervous system and producing mental 
disorders were divided between psychiatric and neurologic conditions: if the syndrome 
had a clear neuroanatomical or neurophysiological basis it was considered neurologic; if 
not, it was deemed psychiatric. This dual distinction, however, has more to do with 
professional areas of competence than scientific logic. For example, schizophrenia, 
considered a psychiatric disorder, affects the brain’s anatomy and physiology, and 
secondarily produces the cognitive, affective, and behavioral symptoms that constitute 
the mental syndrome. On the other hand, epilepsy, typically considered a neurological 
disorder, includes conditions such as temporal epilepsy, in which a clearly identifiable 
psychiatric syndrome is frequently accompanied by an absence of electro-
encephalographic abnormalities. Given that the nosologic classification for these 
disorders is in flux and the division between them is arbitrary, other criteria should be 
used when aggregating diseases for measuring burden. In this respect, in addition to 
their presentation as psychiatric syndromes, these disorders pose a common challenge 
at the primary care level, particularly in low and middle income countries, and a 
common grouping would make this more visible to planners and funders.

Categorizing suicide and intentional self-harm 
In 2013, mental illness accounted for 21·2% of the YLDs worldwide – higher than any 
other group of conditions.11 However, using the composite measure DALYs, the burden 
of mental illness accounted for 7·1%, ranking fifth overall in terms of global burden of 
disease.18,19 The gap between the burden of mental illness as measured by years lived 
with disability and that measured by disability adjusted life years is explained by the fact 
that DALYs underestimate mental illness mortality due to suicide, to the disease process 
itself and to reasons secondary to the mental disorder. Suicide and all forms of self-
harm, which are to a large extent imputable to mental disorders, are coded under 
injuries, and are excluded from calculations of the impact of mental illnesses.10,20,21  
 
Ferrari et al. studied mental disorders as risk factors for suicide reviewing existing 
literature, pooling relative-risk estimates and then estimating which percentage of 
deaths by suicide could be causally linked to a number of mental disorders (mainly 
mood and anxiety disorders, substance abuse and schizophrenia). After reviewing the 
psychological autopsy studies available, the authors assign ceiling values to account for 
cultural variability in the causal relation between mental illness and suicide, and suggest 
an addition of 22 million DALYs amounting to 0.9% of total DALYs to the mental illness 
burden.21 These estimates would have been higher if all self-harm (suicide, attempted 
suicide, and self-injurious behaviour) due to mental illness and sub-syndromal 
conditions were included. Ferrari et al. reduce the attribution of lethal self-harm to the 
mental illness burden based on two arguments: (a) the authors put a cap of 68% to 
suicides attributable to mental illness taking place in China, India and Taiwan, which 
account for 50.0% of the world’s suicides, and of 85.0% to those happening elsewhere, 
and (b) they don’t include suicides in the context of sub-syndromal states (e.g.: 
impulsive states, which are common in the context of personality disorders, also 
excluded from the GBD).   
 
 7 
 
 
From a clinical and public health perspective we have three caveats with the approach 
used by Ferrari et al.: first, it does not account for non-lethal self-harm, which includes 
both attempted suicide and self-injurious behavior; second, by excluding suicides in the 
context of sub-syndromic states and restricting the assessment to specific disorders, it 
leaves around 25.0% of the world’s suicides and 39.0% of suicide burden in the category 
of injuries, along with traffic accidents, where they clearly don’t belong; and third, the 
assignment of a low ceiling due to cultural considerations in China, India, and Taiwan is 
questionable as cultural differences could mean that stigma associated with mental 
illness but not with suicide leads to under-reporting of the causal link. For example, in 
China, suicide has been established as a frequent outcome in the context of mental 
syndromes, even in the absence of full diagnostic criteria. Case control studies of non-
lethal attempted suicide have shown that cases had significantly higher stress, 
impulsiveness and aggression, more severe depressive symptoms, and were more likely 
to meet criteria for a psychiatric diagnosis. Of the psychological factors, severity of 
depressive symptoms in the two preceding weeks was the most significant, to the 
extent that suicide in China is linearly related to severity of depression.22,23 And the 
limitations of the psychological autopsy studies on which Ferrari et al. base their 
rationale for excluding a third of the global self-harm disease burden from mental 
disorders allow for a very different conclusion: the existence of a psychiatric diagnosis 
was established indirectly by interviewing family members, and personality disorders 
were excluded from the assessment, potentially leading to significant under-registry.24 
In this context, the attribution of self-harm – lethal or not – to impulsiveness, 
aggression, and availability of a lethal tool, does not disprove the existence of an 
underlying mental disorder. The authors highlight these limitations, acknowledging that 
the conventional wisdom that suicide is almost always the outcome of mental illness will 
not be altered by their studies.25 In other words, the absence of unequivocal evidence of 
the causal link is not evidence of absence of a causal link. Hence the decision to allocate 
disease burden from suicides to Injuries or to Mental Disorders needs to be carefully 
considered.  
 8 
 
 
 
In this context, and with insufficient evidence, what is the preferred choice between 
different burden estimation methods? The rationale by Ferrari et al. to leave all non-
lethal self-harm and a quarter of the world’s suicides –therefore more than a third of 
self-harm DALYs – in the Injuries aggregation doesn’t seem justifiable. We find it 
preferable from a population health perspective to aggregate all self-injuries with the 
mental health related disease burden, with the caveat that it is likely to incorrectly 
include the burden of suicides that can be judged to be non-mental health related, such 
as assisted suicide (producing a much smaller error than the alternative approach).  
 
Chronic pain syndromes 
Musculoskeletal conditions were the second major cause of YLDs 11 and seventh ranked 
cause of DALYs in 2013 globally.26 They include anatomically based disorders (such as 
osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis), and also syndromes and symptoms (e.g. 
fibromyalgia, low back pain) characterized by pain but without specific anatomical 
correlates. The allocation of the burden corresponding to these syndromes in total to 
the musculoskeletal aggregation is problematic, since (a) a significant proportion of 
these disorders, which account for up to 6·1% of DALYs globally, should actually be 
classified as either ‘chronic pain syndrome’ (currently considered as disorders of the 
nervous system by the ICD-10 classification but should be considered as mental and 
behavioural disorders) or ‘somatoform disorder’ (considered as mental and 
behavioural disorders in ICD-10), (b) the prevalence of these pain disorders in 
patients with a major affective, anxiety, or stress related disorder exceeds 30%, and in 
certain samples with post-traumatic stress disorder reaches 80%, and (c) they converge 
with chronic mental illness at the therapeutic and service delivery level. These caveats 
suggest the existence of subpopulations with a common syndrome, which are difficult to 
classify from a nosologic perspective (see Appendix Box 2). We argue that when 
estimating disease burden, it is reasonable to attribute a proportion of these conditions 
to mental illness. 
 9 
 
 
 
Including people with personality disorders 
Personality disorders are common (4-15% in point prevalence community surveys)27 and 
when severe impose a significant burden both at personal, family, community, and 
population levels. People with personality disorders have shorter life expectancy and 
higher comorbidity with other general and mental illnesses than the general 
population.27 However, due to the inconsistent quality of the evidence personality 
disorders were not included in GBD 2013 estimates within the overall category of 
mental illness.26 A proportion of their disease burden might be currently under the 
‘Other mental and substance use disorders’ aggregation, but hardly capturing its true 
relevance and the need to consider them in their own right. Another portion, arguably 
significant, might be captured under the Musculoskeletal aggregation, given that 30% of 
people diagnosed with chronic pain syndromes also have personality disorder.28 Finally, 
we have seen that personality traits such as impulsivity and aggression, as well as 
depressive symptoms, frequently provide the psychological context in which self-harm 
occurs, providing a rationale to aggregate self-harm under the mental disorder burden. 
Though our re-allocation of self-harm and a fraction of chronic pain (see below) partially 
recaptures this burden, there is not enough data to comprehensively account for the 
burden of personality disorders. 
 
Premature mortality 
People with severe mental illness have up to 60% higher chances of dying prematurely, 
from non-communicable diseases29 that are neglected because of the underlying mental 
condition. They die 10 to 20 years younger than their peers in high income countries, 
and 30 years younger in low income countries.30–32 Charlson et al. estimate that up to 
8% of years of life lost globally corresponded to excess deaths due to mental health 
related conditions including dementia, epilepsy, and migraine.33 Indeed, a recent 
systematic review estimated that 14·3% of deaths worldwide, or approximately eight 
million deaths each year, are attributable to mental disorders.32 However, mental 
 10 
 
 
disorders appear to only account for 0·5% of total years of life lost, because GBD 
estimates only reflect deaths directly attributed to mental disorders recorded in death 
certificates (mostly due to schizophrenia and substance abuse), which leads to zero 
global deaths attributed to bipolar disorder, depression, and other mental illnesses. The 
result with current methodology, which does not count excess deaths due to self-harm 
and increased overall mortality, is that in the case of mental illness, DALYs are basically 
YLDs. The issue of self-harm can be partially addressed through aggregation (see below), 
but the issue of increased mortality due to general conditions poses a very complex 
challenge. GBD methodology is based on zero-sum attribution, which means that if a 
patient with schizophrenia suffers a fatal myocardial infarction at 55 years old as a result 
of smoking, for which she is at increased risk, and neglected metabolic syndrome – a 
likely consequence of antipsychotic medication – then her YLLs will be included in the 
cardiovascular DALYs. In the context of increasing NCD comorbidities, the tradition of 
attributing mortality to a single disease should be reassessed, and alternative 
approaches explored, such as partial attribution of YLLs resulting from a single death to 
different frequently co-occurring disorders.  
 
Revising Disability Adjusted Life Years (2013) estimates for mental illness  
For these reasons set out above we propose that when estimating disease burden, 
certain neurologic syndromes i.e. the dementias, epilepsy, tension-type headache, and 
migraine should be aggregated within the overall category of mental illness. This 
adjustment would move the total rank of mental illnesses in the GBD tables from 5th to 
3rd place overall, accounting for 9·8% of DALYs globally (Table 1). Repositioning all self-
harm related DALYs from the category of injuries to mental health would increase the 
number of DALYs from 9·8 to 11·2%, placing it 2nd in the ranking (Table 1). 
 
Chronic pain syndromes can potentially account for a significant fraction of the 5·4% of 
DALYs currently attributed to low back, neck pain plus other musculoskeletal, once we 
exclude entities for which there is evidence of a musculoskeletal critical mechanistic 
 11 
 
 
level (such as arthritides and gout). As highlighted in Appendix Box 2, a proportion of 
the burden resulting from these syndromes should be aggregated to the mental rather 
than musculoskeletal disorder burden. However, due to a lack of primary disaggregated 
data it is not possible to gauge with any precision: (a) which portion of the burden of 
musculoskeletal disorders corresponds to these chronic pain syndromes; or (b) which 
portion of chronic pain syndrome burden corresponds to centrally caused syndromes 
(and therefore to the mental/neurologic burden as previously defined). Considering that 
a fraction of low back, neck pain, and 50% of other musculoskeletal potentially 
corresponds to chronic pain syndromes, and for the purposes of producing a more 
accurate estimation and stimulating debate, we assume given the limited data that one 
third (rather than 0%, as it is now) of the disease burden of these pain syndromes is 
potentially attributable to mental disorders and explore the effect on mental illness 
burden calculations: re-allocating 1·8% of global DALYs would increase mental illness 
burden from 11.2% (with certain neurological disorders and self-harm added) to 13·0% 
of total, practically tied with all cardiovascular and circulatory disorders, which account 
for 13·5% (Table 1).  
 
(Table 1 about here) 
 
Revising Years Lived with Disability (2013) estimates for mental illness 
 
In 2013, mental illness accounted for 21·2% of global YLDs, 3·5 times greater than the 
disability associated with all infectious diseases (6.0% of YLDs), 4 times that for all 
injuries combined (5.0% of YLDs), 8 times the disability associated with all cardiovascular 
and circulatory diseases (2·8% of YLDs), and 24 times the disability associated to all 
cancers (0·9% of YLDs). Musculoskeletal disorders (plus fractures and soft tissue injuries) 
accounted for 20·8% of total YLDs.11 As we have argued above, a significant portion, 
which we assume to be 5·1 percentage points (see Table 2), potentially corresponds to 
chronic pain syndromes that should not be considered musculoskeletal, but are rooted 
 12 
 
 
in the central nervous system and therefore better understood as part of the burden of 
mental illness. Applying our framework, the new YLD estimation of mental health 
related burden is 32·4%.  
 
(Table 2 about here) 
 
Our estimations of disability alone (YLDs) and combined with mortality (DALYs) indicate 
that by excluding certain conditions from the mental illness burden current assessments 
underestimate both YLDs and DALYs by more than a third (see Figures 1 and 2). We also 
show that mental illness accounts for a third of the global disability (Table 2), instead of 
a fifth, as currently estimated. 
 
Disproportionately weak global response to mental illness 
 
The global development assistance for health (DAH) allocated to mental illness is far 
below the levels warranted by the impact of these disorders. The Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs)34 prioritised child health (MDG 4), maternal health (MDG 5), 
and communicable diseases (MDG 6), which collectively accounted for 46·9% of DALYs 
25 years ago,18 and attracted the vast majority of DAH reaching 68.0% of the $35·9 
billion disbursed in 2014.35,36 Despite the changing burden of disease, characterized by 
multi-morbidity and disability,12 from 2000 to 2014 only 1·5% of DAH was invested 
globally in NCDs (combined, accounting for 82.0% of YLDs) (see Table 3),35,37  while none 
of the MDGs referred to mental illness, which received 0.40% of DAH despite accounting 
for 32.4% of YLDs. 
(Table 3 about here) 
 
The imbalance between disease burden, financing, and service access is observed in 
countries of different income levels (Appendix Table1): global median spending in 
mental health stands at 2·8% of total health spending, more than two thirds of which 
 13 
 
 
are on average allocated to neuropsychiatric hospitals in spite of international evidence-
based recommendations for community based services.38  
 
Low income countries spend a very modest 0·5% of national health budgets on mental 
health, with up to 90.0% going to stand-alone psychiatric institutions that provide, in 
population terms, very low rates of treatment (contact) coverage. Although high income 
countries provide adequate services, there are variations in accessibility and coverage 
for geographic and socio-economic groups.39–41   
 
 
Discussion 
The recent GBD (DALY and YLD) estimates produce an under-estimate of the true impact 
of mental disorders on populations due to (i) the overlap between psychiatric and 
neurological disorders; (ii) the grouping of suicide and behaviours associated with self-
injury as a separate category outside the boundary of mental illness; (iii) the conflation 
of all chronic pain syndromes with musculoskeletal disorders; (iv) the exclusion of 
personality disorders in mental illness disease burden calculations; and (v) inadequate 
consideration of the contribution of severe mental illness to mortality from associated 
causes. Using the currently available evidence and specified assumptions to correct (i), 
(ii), and (iii), we provide a more accurate picture of mental illnesses as a leading cause of 
global disease burden. 
  
Why are these findings important? 
Mental disorders – in various forms and intensities – affect a majority of the population 
in their lifetime.2,3 In most cases people experiencing mild episodes of depression or 
anxiety deal with them in ways that allow them to continue living a productive life. A 
significant minority of the population, however, experience more disabling conditions 
such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, bipolar disorder type I, severe recurrent 
depression, and severe personality disorders. Whereas common mild disorders are 
 14 
 
 
amenable to self-management and relatively simple educational or support measures, 
severe mental illness demands complex, multi-level care that may require a longer-term 
engagement with the individual, and with the family. Hence a more nuanced and 
accurate picture of mental health related burden is critical to effectively allocate 
resources and appropriately design health systems in proportion to the nature and the 
scale of these challenges. 
 
Why are these findings important now?  
Universal Health Coverage, identified as a Sustainable Development Goal42, offers 
opportunities for addressing the neglect for mental illnesses, which constitute, along 
with all cardiovascular plus circulatory disorders (13·0% and 13·5%  respectively), the  
leading causes of global disease burden. Of particular importance is the inclusion of the 
mental health indicators proposed in the 2015 Global Reference List of Core Health 
Indicators43 (see Appendix Box 3).  
 
 
Limitations of this approach 
The main limitation of this study is the difficulty of quantifying the disease burden 
associated with: (1) personality disorders, (2) excess all-cause mortality secondary to 
mental illness, and (3) chronic pain syndrome burden as part of the mental illness 
burden. Regarding 1 and 2, data for further evidence-based assumptions is required, so 
their contribution remains to be determined. Regarding chronic pain syndromes, there 
is partial evidence to make a scientifically informed assumption that in our view 
provides a better estimate than the current hypothesis of 0% attribution. However, the 
speculative nature of the portion of the chronic pain burden considered by the authors 
to be related to mental health –one third- remains hypothetical.  
 
Time for Global Action 
 15 
 
 
Globally, achieving effective coverage will demand concerted global stewardship to 
increase funding for mental illness, better allocate resources, and improve integration of 
mental illness with other health services.

Box 1: 25 years estimating the Global Burden of Disease: DALYs, YLLs, and 
YLDs revisited  
 
The GBD methodology was developed in 1990 as an attempt to provide a composite 
measure comprising mortality and disability, and allowing for comparison of burden 
across diseases and across countries. The scope of the collaboration has grown and 
the basic methodology has evolved over time in response to the scientific 
community’s input. The staple is still the measure Disability Adjusted Life Years 
(DALY), which is the sum of the Years of Life Lost (YLLs) due to premature mortality 
and the Years Lived with Disability (YLDs) produced by a given disorder –or group 
of disorders- in a given country, region, or globally.  
 
The YLL can be understood as a mortality measure weighted by normative life 
expectancy: death will produce a number of YLLs equivalent to life expectancy 
minus age of death. The normative life tables, with a life expectancy at birth of 86, 
were developed to reflect the lowest death rate for each age group observed in 
countries of more than 5 million people.(1)  
 
The YLD can be understood as a measurement of disability weighted by the general 
public’s perception of different health states resulting from disease. This was 
achieved through empiric assessment: a survey was conducted in five countries 
from different regions (n=13902) and online (n=16328), eliciting paired 
comparisons between two random health states (i.e.: asking which of the two was 
regarded as healthier), and producing a disability weight between 0 –perfect health- 
and 1 –equivalent to death-. The YLD is the result of multiplying the disability 
weight by the prevalence of the disorder.(2) 
 
To classify diseases, the GBD produces a list of 306 diseases and injuries –from the 
ICD-10 nosology-, aggregated in four hierarchical levels. There are three categories 
in the first level:  communicable, maternal, neonatal and nutritional disorders; non-
communicable disorders (NCDs); and injuries. In the second level we find 21 mutually 
exclusive and collectively exhaustive aggregations, among them: mental and 
substance use disorders; musculoskeletal disorders; cardiovascular and circulatory 
disorders; diabetes, urogenital, blood and endocrine; self-harm and interpersonal 
violence. The third level presents lower levels of aggregation, such as depressive 
disorders, low-back and neck pain, and self-harm (with no lower aggregations for 
self-harm) . The fourth level contains individual diseases, such as major depressive 
disorder and low-back pain, or the lowest level of aggregation available, such as 
Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias. This is a dynamic hierarchical list, in which 
several factors –such as quality of evidence, perceived burden, or policy interest- 
influence the decision of whether to include a specific disorder. Some aggregations 
follow clinically related syndromes (such as depressive disorders for major 
depression and dysthymia, sometimes they follow epidemiologic considerations 
 28 
 
 
(such as NCDs), and sometimes they are laundry-lists (DUBE). Given these 
considerations, it is legitimate –and even desirable- to explore different 
aggregations ex-post (such as we propose for some neurological disorders, self-harm, 
and a fraction of chronic pain syndrome), to better inform specific estimates. This 
kind of repositioning, aimed at a more nuanced understanding in the light of 
insufficient data, respects the zero-sum criterion. More challenging is the correction 
of estimates of excess death resulting from multi-morbidity without double 
counting (see Premature mortality). 
 
 
 29 
 
 
Box 2. The nosologic conundrum of pain syndromes 
 
Painful syndromes highlight the frequently arbitrary nature of diagnostic 
classifications, particularly when etiology is unclear. Most mental disorders are 
syndromes – collections of symptoms and signs – which based on the existing 
evidence are believed to be causally related to underlying disease entities. This 
relation – between the syndrome we diagnose and the underlying disease – is not 
transparent, and in some cases widely contested. It escapes the scope of this article 
to review psychiatric nosology, but it is necessary to bear in mind that nosologic 
classifications should be based on the best existing evidence. And in the absence of 
nosologic clarity, GBD aggregation decisions should contemplate population health 
needs and service delivery considerations.  
 
As was mentioned before, standard GBD methodology is based on strictly following 
ICD criteria, which warrants comprehensive burden allocation without double 
counting. The tradeoff is that results can be misleading, particularly when they 
compound nosologic limitations. They need to be qualified and contextualized so 
that they are useful to inform population health interventions.  
 
The case of painful syndromes is an example of how dualistic thinking muddles 
nosology: ICD-10 includes chronic pain syndrome and persistent somatoform pain, 
while DSMIV offers pain syndrome, and DSM5 settles for somatic symptom disorder 
with predominant pain. Despite the lack of nosologic clarity, these are highly 
prevalent disorders: for example in Germany, following strict diagnostic 
methodology, pain disorder stood out as the most prevalent psychiatric disorder in 
the general population, with an 8% yearly prevalence (11% for women and 4% for 
men).(3) None of these disorders are captured as such in the GBD list of causes,(4) 
arguably because of the scarcity of quality evidence at the global level. Given GBD 
methodology, this sub-group of complex patients are in all likelihood included in the 
low-back, neck, and other painful syndromes aggregations. Mechanically aggregating 
them to the musculoskeletal disorder burden ignores a piece of consistent evidence 
we actually have: what characterizes a sub-group of these patients is the lack of an 
anatomical musculoskeletal correlate to their clinical syndrome, and a growing body 
of evidence actually points in the direction of these pain syndromes being related to 
neurologic or psychiatric disorders. They are frequent conditions -8% yearly 
prevalence-, so highly co-morbid with mental disorders -53% have concurrent 
mood or anxiety disorders(3)- that painful symptoms are often considered part of 
the wider mental syndrome.(5,6) Plausibility also suggests that the critical 
mechanistic level for these conditions is the central nervous system –through a 
central dysregulation of pain sensitivity(7–9)-, rather than the musculoskeletal 
 30 
 
 
system, where by definition there is nothing specific to be found. In addition to the 
arguments related to nosology and plausibility, we also find convergence at the 
therapeutic service delivery level: chronic pain syndromes are most frequently 
treated with antidepressants and anticonvulsants, which are the only types of drugs 
that have yielded consistent evidence of partial efficacy, plus a variety of 
psychotherapeutic and psychosocial approaches, just like chronic mental 
disorders.(10) So if we were to be guided by the evidence, we should conclude that a 
significant sub-group of these patients, difficult to identify nosologically with 
current tools, suffer from a disease burden that is better placed in the mental than in 
the musculoskeletal aggregation.
