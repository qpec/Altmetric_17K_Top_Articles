Background: The rate of early sport specialization in professional baseball players is unknown.
Purpose: To report the incidence and age of sport specialization in current professional baseball players and the impact of early
specialization on the frequency of serious injuries sustained during the players’ careers. We also queried participants about when
serious injuries occurred, the players’ current position on the field, and their opinions regarding the need for young athletes to
specialize early to play at the professional level.
Study Design: Descriptive epidemiological study.
Methods: A total of 102 current professional baseball players anonymously completed a 7-question written survey. Early sport
specialization was defined as “single-sport participation prior to high school.” Injury was defined as “a serious injury or surgery that
required the player to refrain from sports (baseball) for an entire year.” Chi-square tests were used to investigate the risk of injury in
those who specialized early in baseball versus those who did not. Independent-sample t tests were used to compare injury rates
based on current player position.
Results: Fifty (48%) baseball players specialized early. The mean age at initiation of sport specialization was 8.91 years (SD, 3.7
years). Those who specialized early reported more serious injuries (mean, 0.54; SD, 0.838) during their professional baseball career
than those who did not (mean, 0.23; SD, 0.425) (P ¼ .044). Finally, 63.4% of the queried players believed that early sport spe-
cialization was not required to play professional baseball.
Conclusion: Our study demonstrated a statistically significant higher rate of serious injury during a baseball player’s professional
career in those players who specialized early. Most current professional baseball players surveyed believed that sport speciali-
zation was not required prior to high school to master the skills needed to play at the professional level. Our findings demonstrate
an increased incidence of serious injuries in professional baseball players who specialized in baseball prior to high school. Youth
baseball athletes should be encouraged not to participate in a single sport given the potential for an increased incidence of serious
injuries later in their careers. No data are available to suggest that early specialization is needed to reach the professional level.

been increasing progressively, to the point that 77.7% of
high school athletic directors have reported an increase in
this trend.16,23 Jayanthi et al15 popularized the definition
of sport specialization as “year-round [8+ months/year]
intensive training in a single sport at the exclusion of
other sports.” The trend toward specializing early (ie,
before high school age) in a single sport is multifactorial
in nature but is likely driven by the idea that if an
athlete focuses on one sport, his or her athletic perfor-
mance in that sport will be better than the performance
of those who play multiple sports. The concept of spe-
cialization improving human performance was buoyed
by a study by Ericsson et al,6 who predicted expert per-
formance based on the duration of exposure (practice)
with development of the all-too-famous “10,000-hour
rule.” However, the effectiveness of increasing the
amount of early exposure to a single sport on athletic
performance is still being debated.10 Injuries in baseball
have been a focus of attention for those studying injury
rates and patterns in youth sports for some time. Mod-
ifiable risk factors for injury have been studied in youth

To our knowledge, no studies of current professional
baseball players have compared injury rates in those who
specialized early compared with those athletes who did not.
The purpose of this study was to report the incidence and
age of sport specialization in current professional baseball
players and the impact of early specialization on the fre-
quency of serious injuries sustained during the players’
careers. Also, participants were queried about when serious
injuries occurred, their current position on the field, and
their opinions regarding the need for young athletes to spe-
cialize early in order to play at the professional level.
METHODS
This study involved 102 participants (aged 22-40 years) who
were active professional baseball players during the 2016
season in the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball,
which is an independent professional league comprised of 8
teams. The players were provided a 7-question written sur-
vey in either English or Spanish; in addition, players were
asked to provide their current age and current position
played (Figure 1). A total of 8 teams, with 30 players at
maximum on each roster, allowed for a total of 240 potential
participants. Participation in this survey was voluntary, and
the player responses remained anonymous. Survey comple-
tion was proctored by the team’s licensed athletic trainer.
Players were asked whether they had specialized in base-
ball prior to high school and were queried as to the age at
which they specialized. Our definition of sport specializa-
tion was “intense, year-round training in a single sport with
the exclusion of other sports.” We inquired about serious
injury and when the injury occurred. Injury was defined as
a baseball-related injury or surgery that required the
player to refrain from the sport for an entire year. Finally,
athletes were asked whether they believed that early sport
specialization (ie, prior to high school) was required to play
at the professional level.
Data from the surveys were complied, and differences
were considered significant at P < .05. Chi-square tests were
used to investigate the relationship of injury risk at the youth
and professional levels based on the participant’s age at the
time of sport specialization. Players were designated into 4
position categories: pitcher, catcher, infield, or outfield.
Independent-samples t tests were used to compare injury
rates based on player position.
RESULTS
A total of 102 professional baseball players took part in the
study during the 2016 baseball season. Participants ranged
from 22 to 40 years of age, and the mean age was 29. Fifty
(49%) participants specialized early in baseball (Figure 2).
Overall, baseball specialization began at age 4 to 17 years,
with the mean age being 8.91 years (Figure 3). Additional
player characteristics are provided in Table 1. One player

 did not give his opinion on the need for sport specialization
to play at the professional level; both players were included
in all data analysis.
Thirty-two players reported 1 or more serious injuries
as a professional baseball player, with the maximum being
4. Those who specialized early reported more injuries
(mean, 0.54; SD, 0.838) as a professional baseball player
than those who did not specialize early (mean, 0.23; SD,
0.425) (P ¼ .044). A total of 3 players reported having a
serious injury while participating in youth baseball, which
revealed no significant difference between those who spe-
cialized early and those who did not. No association was
found between injury rates and the players’ current posi-
tion. The majority of current professional baseball players
(63.4%) believed that sport specialization prior to high
school was not required to achieve the skills necessary to
play professionally.
DISCUSSION
Although the rate of early sport specialization in young
athletes has been studied, the downstream effects of
early specialization on professional athletes have
not.16,23 Our study is the first to report the incidence of
early sport specialization in professional baseball players
while also reporting on variables such as injury inci-
dence and age at specialization. Two previous studies
have assessed sport specialization in professional base-
ball players. Hill13 reported that a large proportion of
professional baseball players had played basketball and
football in high school; in addition to playing baseball,
68.7% had played basketball and 59.3% had played foot-
ball in high school. The author did not evaluate injury
incidence in the study group or report the age at which
the players specialized.13 Ginsburg et al11 reported that
25% of professional players specialized before age 12 and
the mean age of specialization was 15; again, injury
rates were not discussed. In contrast, our study demon-
strated that 49% of players specialized in baseball prior
to high school.
Factors contributing to the bimodal distribution of the
player’s age at specialization may be both geographic and
cultural. At the start of the 2016 season, 28.5% of Major
League Baseball (MLB) players were of Latin American
origin.18 Baseball is largely a warm weather outdoor sport.
Players who grew up in warmer climates may have had
more opportunity to participate in baseball year-round
and therefore specialized earlier.
A 3% increase has been noted in organized sports
activity participation from 1997 to 2008 in children
younger than 7 years.23 This trend is likely to continue
with the heightened awareness and media attention on
successful elite athletes worldwide, along with the finan-
cial compensation those athletes receive for their profes-
sional success.
The trend toward sport specialization is multifactorial in
nature but is likely driven by the idea that if an athlete
focuses on one sport, his or her athletic performance will
be superior to those who play multiple sports during the
calendar year. Other potential benefits to early specializa-
tion, besides giving the athlete an edge in competition,
include early exposure to collegiate and professional scouts
and the downstream potential for financial rewards such as
scholarships for college or the potential to sign a profes-
sional contract. The sobering fact is that approximately
1 in 200, or 0.5%, of high school senior boys playing inter-
scholastic baseball in the United States will eventually be
drafted by an MLB organization.7 Even fewer players
actually play in the major leagues. Although parents often
appear to be the driving factor for a single sport focus,
multiple studies have demonstrated that the coach may
be the most influential in this decision process.16 Youth
coaches may believe that expert skills will be achieved
only if the athlete’s focus is directed to a single activity
or sport. This prevailing thought potentially comes from
a study by Ericsson et al,6 who predicted expert human
performance with development of the “10,000-hour rule.”
In that study, the investigators determined that it would
take around 10,000 hours of dedicated practice before
expert level performance would be attainable. Although
the study was focused on the skills developed by students
of a musical instrument, it seems reasonable that special-
ization may have similar results on a sporting field as well.
The exact age at which to specialize in a single sport and
the time it takes to acquire the skill set needed to reach the
professional level are far from established and likely are
different for each individual player.9 For the professional
baseball players who completed our survey, the mean age
of baseball specialization was 8.91 years. Intuitively, it
makes sense that specializing at an early age to master
sport-specific skill sets would be beneficial to all athletes,
but some studies have suggested that specialization
later in childhood may lead to increased athletic
achievement.4,12,16,17,20 Carlson4 found that elite tennis
players in Sweden reported later sport specialization com-
pared with near-elite players. Gullich and Emrich12 studied
German Olympic athletes and found that the elite athletes
specialized later and were more likely to have participated in
more than one sport past the age of 11 years. Lidor and
Lavyan20 discovered similar results, reporting that

 individuals were more likely to be multisport athletes under
the age of 11 and began to specialize after age 12. The age
range of sport specialization may vary greatly depending on
multiple factors, such as the actual sport or the sexual or
neurocognitive development of the athlete. For instance,
many female ballet dancers will not go en pointe until men-
arche due to stress on the hallux physes. Studies such as
these demonstrate that we still do not have a clear under-
standing of when and whether sport specialization should
occur in our youth.
Much debate remains regarding when and whether
single-sport specialization may be harmful. In our study,
we found a statistically significant increase in risk of a
serious injury as a professional athlete if the player had
specialized prior to high school. Interestingly, only 3 pro-
fessional athletes reported sustaining a serious injury prior
to high school; thus, in this study there was no correlation
between specialization and injury as a youth athlete. Rose
et al26 studied high school athletes of all sports and found
that increased exposure to sport was the most important risk
factor for injury. Baseball in particular has been a focus of
attention for those studying injury rates and patterns in
youth sports. Fleisig et al10 followed youth baseball pitchers
for 10 years and found that those who pitched more than 100
innings per year were 3.5 times more likely to be injured.
Other investigators found a significantly increased risk of
shoulder or elbow surgery if athletes pitched more than 8
months out of the year.25 A multitude of variables may affect
injury rates from sport-specific training and specialization;
thus, to pinpoint one specific cause is extremely difficult.
Concerns about the effects of early specialization on
injury rates and psychological burnout have led at least
7 sport authorities to publish position statements on sport
specialization.1-3,9,14,24 After an internal review of the cur-
rent literature, USA Baseball, USA Cycling, and USA Swim-
ming have initiated recommendations related to youth
athletes in regard to pitch counts, gear ratios, and practice
times, respectively.8 The American Orthopaedic Society of
Sports Medicine published a consensus statement in 2016
and concluded that no evidence is available to show that
youth athletes will benefit from early sport specialization
in the majority of sports and that early multisport participa-
tion will not be detrimental to future athletic success.19
While the caveats of our study include low sensitivity
to statistical analysis due to a relatively small sample
size for mean (and median) number of injuries, our data
seem to support the notion that early sport specialization
in youth may contribute to an increased number of seri-
ous injuries as a professional baseball player. Including
more study participants would have helped solidify this
association.
This study is also limited by recall bias based on the
recollection of serious injuries sustained many years ago
by the participants. While it may be easier to recall such
events in those who are young and healthy, some partici-
pants were asked to recall life events that occurred up to 36
years previously. This potentially could have resulted in
underreporting of serious injuries prior to high school level.
To help reduce recall bias, we limited the definition of
“injury” to a baseball-related injury, or surgery related to a
baseball injury, that required the player to refrain from
sports for an entire year. Unfortunately, by establishing
return to sport at 1 year, we may have introduced a selec-
tion bias by underreporting some significant injuries that
may have kept an athlete out of competition for 6, 9, or
even 11 months. This would have falsely lowered the
injury rates seen in both the pre–high school and the pro-
fessional settings.
Our study included all serious baseball-related injuries.
We did not specifically query whether the injury involved
the player’s throwing arm. Some may propose that this is a
weakness of the study; however, we believe that early spe-
cialization may increase the risk of all injuries, not just
overuse injuries to the dominant extremity. Athletes spe-
cializing early in a single sport are prone to develop an
inverted athletic performance pyramid (Figure 4) by focus-
ing on sport-specific skills at the expense of sound funda-
mental movement patterns. A failure to develop sound
functional movement patterns may place the entire kinetic
chain at risk.
CONCLUSION
Professional baseball players may be at higher risk of sus-
taining a serious injury during their career if they special-
ized early in baseball during their youth. The current study
was unable to show that early baseball specialization
increased risk of injury for these players prior to turning
professional. A player’s position was not associated with
injury in this study. As only 49% of the players who
responded to our survey specialized in baseball before high
school, it is evident that sport specialization as a child is not
required to reach the professional level. A total of 63% of the
professional athletes in our survey believed that sport spe-
cialization was not required to play baseball at the profes-
sional level. Youth athletes should be encouraged to play
multiple sports through high school, with the knowledge
that doing so will not hinder their potential to become a
professional baseball player.
