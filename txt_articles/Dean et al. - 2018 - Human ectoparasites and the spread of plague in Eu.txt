Plague, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, can spread through
human populations by multiple transmission pathways. Today, most
human plague cases are bubonic, caused by spillover of infected fleas
from rodent epizootics, or pneumonic, caused by inhalation of infec-
tious droplets. However, little is known about the historical spread of
plague in Europe during the Second Pandemic (14–19th centuries),
including the Black Death, which led to high mortality and recurrent
epidemics for hundreds of years. Several studies have suggested that
human ectoparasite vectors, such as human fleas (Pulex irritans) or
body lice (Pediculus humanus humanus), caused the rapidly spreading
epidemics. Here, we describe a compartmental model for plague
transmission by a human ectoparasite vector. Using Bayesian infer-
ence, we found that this model fits mortality curves from nine out-
breaks in Europe better than models for pneumonic or rodent
transmission. Our results support that human ectoparasites were pri-
mary vectors for plague during the Second Pandemic, including the
Black Death (1346–1353), ultimately challenging the assumption that
plague in Europe was predominantly spread by rats.

P
lague, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, has been exten-
sively studied due to its modern and historical significance. In
the past, plague has famously caused at least three pandemics in
human history: the First Pandemic beginning with the Justinianic
Plague (6th to 8th centuries), the Second Pandemic beginning with
the “Black Death” (14th to 19th centuries), and the Third Pandemic
(beginning in the 19th century) (1). Today, plague persists primarily
in rodent reservoirs in Asia, Africa, and the Americas, where it
poses a recurrent threat to nearby human settlements (2).
The most common forms of plague infection are bubonic and
pneumonic (2). Bubonic plague occurs when bacteria enter the
skin, usually from the bite of an infected flea vector. The bacteria
are then transported to the lymph nodes, causing characteristic
swelling, or “buboes.” Bubonic plague is typically transmitted to
humans from wild or commensal rodents (3), but transmission
between people is also thought to occur by human ectoparasites,
such as human fleas (Pulex irritans) or body lice (Pediculus
humanus humanus) (4). Primary pneumonic plague occurs when
aerosolized bacteria enter and infect the lungs. Pneumonic plague
can also arise as a complication of bubonic or septicemic infections
(2), known as secondary pneumonic plague. Individuals with
pneumonic plague can transmit the disease through the respiratory
route, although outbreaks of pneumonic plague are typically small
because infected persons die rapidly without treatment (5). Septi-
cemic plague occurs when bacteria infect the bloodstream, com-
monly from a primary pneumonic or bubonic infection (2).
A central focus of historical plague research has been to un-
derstand the spread and persistence of plague in Europe. Little is
known about the transmission of plague in Europe, the Middle
East, and North Africa during the Second Pandemic, including
the Black Death, when the disease killed an estimated one-third
of the population. Many studies (4, 6, 7) have suggested that human
ectoparasites, like human fleas and body lice, were more likely than
commensal rats to have caused the rapidly spreading epidemics.
Proponents of the “human ectoparasite hypothesis” argue that
plague epidemics during the Second Pandemic differ from the rat-
associated epidemics that occurred later, during the Third Pan-
demic. Specifically, the geographic spread and total mortality of the
Black Death far exceeds that of modern plague epidemics (8).
While contemporaneous accounts of symptoms during the Second
Pandemic are consistent with those of plague (7), there are no de-
scriptions of rat epizootics, or “rat falls,” that often precede epi-
demics in the Third Pandemic (7–9). Some have noted that the
climate of northern Europe could not have fostered the widespread
distribution of Rattus rattus (10), a claim that is supported by a
scarcity of rats in the archaeological record (6). Finally, epidemio-
logical characteristics of plague in Europe, such as a high rate of
household transmission (11), are suggestive of a more direct trans-
mission route (12).
Despite support for human ectoparasite transmission, it has
been difficult to assess their historical contribution because their
role in modern plague epidemics appears to be relatively minor.
Today, human ectoparasite diseases have declined in most de-
veloped countries, but they are still associated with poverty and
unhygienic conditions (13). In the past, human ectoparasites
Significance
Plague is infamous as the cause of the Black Death (1347–1353)
and later Second Pandemic (14th to 19th centuries CE), when
devastating epidemics occurred throughout Europe, the Middle
East, and North Africa. Despite the historical significance of the
disease, the mechanisms underlying the spread of plague in
Europe are poorly understood. While it is commonly assumed
that rats and their fleas spread plague during the Second
Pandemic, there is little historical and archaeological support
for such a claim. Here, we show that human ectoparasites, like
body lice and human fleas, might be more likely than rats to
have caused the rapidly developing epidemics in pre-Industrial
Europe. Such an alternative transmission route explains many
of the notable epidemiological differences between historical
and modern plague epidemics.

 have been efficient vectors for diseases such as epidemic typhus
(14) and relapsing fever (15). In 1941, plague-infected body lice
and human fleas were found on septicemic patients during an
outbreak in Morocco (16), indicating that humans can transmit
the disease to lice and human fleas. In addition, recent experi-
mental studies have demonstrated that body lice can transmit the
bacteria to naive rabbits (4, 17–19). However, the transmission
from body lice and human fleas to humans has not yet been
documented, and thus the importance of human ectoparasite
transmission in current and historic settings remains an open
question. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that human ec-
toparasites may indeed play such a role.
Mathematical modeling can provide strong insight into mecha-
nisms of plague transmission for past epidemics. Previous epide-
miological models of plague during the Second Pandemic are
focused mainly on modeling the spread of the disease by commensal
rats during a single outbreak (20, 21). In this study, we developed a
susceptible–infectious–recovered (SIR) model for plague trans-
mission with a human ectoparasite vector and compared it to
models for pneumonic and rat–flea transmission. We applied these
models to nine outbreaks during the Second Pandemic, to gain a
broad understanding of the transmission dynamics of plague in
European epidemics. We identified the best-fitting model for each
outbreak and estimated the basic reproduction number, R0.
Methods
Historical Data. We used data on the daily and weekly disease-induced mortality
for nine plague outbreaks during the Second Pandemic (Table 1). These data
were publicly available in secondary sources including published articles, books,
and government reports. We digitized the epidemic data from printed tables
and graphs, using the entire duration of each outbreak, apart from Eyam,
which had two mortality peaks. The deterministic models we used cannot ac-
count for the stochasticity of infectious disease processes during the early phase
of an epidemic; thus, for the outbreak in Eyam, we removed the first 279 data
points and considered only the second, larger epidemic peak. To validate the
models for pneumonic and rat-associated plague epidemics, we used three
additional mortality curves from epidemics with known transmission routes
during the Third Pandemic (Table S1).
Parameters. The parameter values and initial conditions used in the models
are shown in Table 2 and Table S2. Fixed values were taken from field, ex-
perimental, or epidemiological case studies when available. Unobservable
parameters were estimated using Bayesian inference.

 Human–Ectoparasite Model. The transmission of bubonic plague by a human
ectoparasite vector, such as human fleas or body lice, is modeled by seven
differential equations:
dSh
dt = −βl

Nh

dIlow
dt = βl

The five compartments for humans that are functions of time t: susceptible
(Sh), infectious with mild bacteremia ðIlowÞ, infectious with high bacteremia
ðIhighÞ, recovered ðRhÞ, and dead ðDhÞ. The total living population is given by
Nh = Sh + Ilow + Ihigh + Rh. The transmission of plague from vectors to humans
occurs at rate βl. The model assumes that humans are mildly infectious for an
average of 8 d (σb−1), and transmission is unlikely at rate βlow. Humans with
mild bacteremia may recover at rate gh, which is around 40% for untreated
bubonic plague. Experimental studies have shown that fleas must feed
on hosts with high levels of bacteremia for reliable transmission (40).
Therefore, the model assumes that moribund humans transmit plague at a
high rate to vectors βhigh for an average of 2 d (γb
−1). Given the short du-
ration of the outbreaks, we did not model natural births and deaths in the
human population.
Human ectoparasite vectors are modeled in two compartments (Sl, Il). The
susceptible vector population grows at the intrinsic growth rate rl. The
growth of the vector population is limited by the carrying capacity Kl, which
is the product of the parasite index and the number of human hosts Nh.
Modern studies show that the rate of body louse infestation and abundance
in affected human populations ranges from 10.5 to 67.7 lice on average per
person (33, 41).
There are a limited number of studies that evaluate human fleas and body
lice as vectors for plague (17–19). These studies have shown both vectors
have similar transmission cycles for Y. pestis, and this makes it difficult to
distinguish between the two species with either model structure or pa-
rameter values (17–19). Our model uses parameters specific to body lice;
however, the ranges for the lice and flea parameters overlap. The duration
of infection γl
−1 has been shown experimentally for both species, and is on
average 4.5 d for human fleas and 3 d for body lice (17–19). The model as-
sumes that infected human fleas and body lice do not recover. The trans-
mission of plague by human fleas is hypothesized to occur through early
phase transmission, an alternative to blocked transmission observed in rat fleas
(Xenopsylla cheopis) that does not require a lengthy extrinsic incubation
period (42).
Pneumonic Plague Model. The direct human-to-human transmission of plague
is modeled by three differential equations:
dSh
dt = −βp
ShIh
Nh
,
dIh
dt = βp
ShIh
Nh
− γpIh,
dDh
dt = γpIh.
There are three compartments for humans (Sh, Ih, Dh) and the total human
population is Nh = Sh + Ih. There is no compartment for recovered individuals
because the case fatality rate of untreated pneumonic plague is close to
100% (43). The human-to-human transmission of pneumonic plague occurs
at rate βp. The disease-induced mortality occurs at rate γp per day and is
equal to the inverse of the infectious period, which is a mean of 2.5 d for
pneumonic plague (5).
Rat–Flea Model. Based on a metapopulation model for bubonic plague by
Keeling and Gilligan (35, 36), the transmission of plague in a rodent
epizootic, and the spillover to humans is modeled by 10 differential
equations:

dt = ð1 − ghÞγhIh.
There are four compartments for rats (Sr, Ir, Rr, Dr) and the total rat
population is Nr = Sr + Ir + Rr. As epidemics within the rat population can
only occur when a large proportion of the rats are susceptible to the
disease, we assumed an initial black rat (Rattus rattus) population that
was entirely susceptible. Although the expected ratio of urban rats to
humans is about 1 rat to every 5 people (44), we allowed the prior in the
model to have a maximum ratio of 1:1 rats to humans. Increasing the rat
population in medieval cities allowed the simulated rat-borne plague out-
breaks to more easily reach the mortality levels observed in humans during the
Second Pandemic.
Rat fleas (X. cheopis) are modeled as the average number of fleas per rat,
H, and the number of free infectious fleas, F. The flea population has a
natural growth rate, rf, that is limited by the carrying capacity Kf. We as-
sumed that the flea population is limited by the number of rat hosts, be-
cause X. cheopis does not reproduce on humans (45). Plague is transmitted
to rats at rate βr by free infectious fleas searching for a host with searching
efficiency a. We further assumed that fleas can transmit plague in the early
phase (42). Rats die at a rate equal to the inverse of the infectious period
γr
−1, or recover with probability gr. When an infected rat dies, a number of
free infectious fleas are released into the environment, depending on the
average number of fleas per rat. Free infectious fleas die at rate df. The
model assumes that plague is a rodent disease and that human cases are a
consequence of mortality in the rat population. Therefore, susceptible hu-
mans Sh become infected by free infectious fleas at rate βh. Humans remain
infected for an average of 10 d (γh
−1), at which point they either recover at
rate gh or die.
In the model by Keeling and Gilligan (35, 36), it is assumed that the force
of infection from free infectious fleas is divided exclusively between rats and
humans. However, the authors note that the true force of infection to hu-
mans is less because not every flea will find and infect a human (35). For our
model, we sought to establish a range for βh that would accurately lower the
force of infection to humans. To establish this range, we fitted the model to
observed mortality for both rats and humans in Hong Kong in 1903 (Fig. S1)
and found that the mean estimate for βh was 0.1 (Table S3). Using simula-
tions, we found that βh should be less than 0.2 to preserve the characteristic
delay and higher peak mortality of the rat epizootic compared with the
human epidemic. Based on these observations, we constrained the prior for

 the transmission rate to humans βh to 0.0–0.2, which enabled us to use this
model for outbreaks where only human mortality was available.
Bayesian Inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo. We fitted the deterministic
models to the observed data using Bayesian inference and estimated un-
observable parameters of interest. The models had a time-step of 1 d and
were fitted to daily mortality or weekly mortality. Denoting the set of model
parameters as Θ = fS0, β, . . .g, the probability p of the observed data D1...m
given Θ is calculated as the product of a series of Poisson random variables
with mean λT equal to the human mortality in the model at times T1...m:
pðDjΘÞ = ∏
m
T=1
e−λT ðλT ÞDT
DT ! .
The parameters that we fitted were the transmission rates for each model
(βlow, βhigh, βp, βr, βh) and the size of the initial primary host population that
was at risk [Sð0Þh, Sð0Þr] or infected [Ið0Þh, Ið0Þr]. We assumed uniformly
distributed priors and obtained posterior distributions using Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations with an adaptive Metropolis–Hastings al-
gorithm implemented in PyMC2 (46) (for examples of the implementation,
see https://zenodo.org/record/1043924). We ran the MCMC simulations for
180,000 iterations with a burn-in of 80,000 iterations and a thinning of 10.
We assessed convergence for each model by running three independent
MCMC chains and verifying that the Gelman–Rubin statistic (47) was
<1.05 for each parameter. We performed model comparison using the
Bayesian information criterion (BIC) from the maximum-likelihood esti-
mates of the model parameters (48). The model with the lowest BIC value
was the unique preferred model if the second-best model had a BIC value
of at least 10 larger (49).
Estimation of the Basic Reproduction Number. We estimated the basic re-
production number in each model for the primary host using the next-
generation matrix method (50).
Reporting Error. We conducted the analysis again considering different levels
of underreporting (10%, 25%, and 50%) for each outbreak. To do so, we
incorporated a constant probability of reporting into the likelihood function.
Results
Model Fit and Selection. We used Bayesian MCMC and the
mortality data to fit the three transmission models: human ec-
toparasite plague (EP), pneumonic plague (PP), and rat-borne
plague (RP) (Fig. 1). The posterior means and 95% credible
intervals for the fitted parameters in each model are given in
Table S3. Fig. 1 shows the fit of each model to the observed
mortality. For the smallest outbreaks, Eyam and Givry, it is
difficult to visually distinguish between the models because the
credible intervals are overlapping. In general, the human ecto-
parasite model fit the pattern of the observed data for the Sec-
ond Pandemic outbreaks. However, the model could not account
for irregularities in the observed mortality from Malta and
Moscow, which have two peaks. For the pneumonic plague
model, the mortality curve is right skewed compared with the
observed mortality. Mortality in the rat model tended to grow
slowly while plague spread through the rat population, and
peaked higher than the observed mortality.

 We compared the three competing models using the BIC. Our
results (Table 3) show that the human ectoparasite model had the
lowest BIC value for all outbreaks, except Eyam and Givry. For the
remaining outbreaks, the difference in BIC for the human ecto-
parasite model and the other candidate models was greater than
10, which provides strong evidence against the pneumonic and rat–
flea models (50). For Eyam and Givry, the difference between the
human ectoparasite model and another model was less than 10;
therefore, neither model could be excluded.
To verify our model comparison method, we fitted the models to
three additional Third Pandemic outbreaks with known transmission
routes (Fig. S2). We found that the model with the lowest BIC
matched the known modes of transmission for the outbreaks in
Hong Kong (rats) and Harbin (pneumonic) (Table S5). However, we
could not distinguish between two of the models for a small outbreak
of rat-associated plague in Sydney, suggesting together with the re-
sults from Eyam and Givry, that our model comparison method is
better suited for sufficiently large outbreaks (>750 deaths).
Basic Reproduction Number R0. By definition, the basic reproduction
number, R0, is the average number of secondary cases produced by
a primary case, given an entirely susceptible population. In practice,
R0 is an important threshold for disease invasion. For each of the
three models, we calculated R0 from the posterior estimates of the
fitted parameters (Table 3). For all of the models, R0 was greater
than 1, which is above the threshold for disease invasion. Using the
human ectoparasite model, the estimated R0 was 1.48–1.91 for all
pre-Industrial outbreaks.
Reporting Error. We considered the impact of different levels of
constant underreporting of deaths throughout the epidemics on
model selection (Table S6). We found that underreporting of
10% and 25% did not change the results of the model selection;
under these conditions, the human ectoparasite model was the
best fit for all outbreaks in Europe except Eyam and Givry.
Underreporting of 50% changed the best-fitting models of
Gdansk and Givry to pneumonic plague. For these cities, 50%
underreporting resulted in the death of more than 90% of the
population, giving preference to a pneumonic plague model
where all infected individuals die from plague.
Discussion
Our study supports human ectoparasite transmission of plague
during the Second Pandemic, including the Black Death. Using
recent experimental data on human fleas and body lice as plague
vectors, we have developed a compartmental model that cap-
tures the dynamics of human ectoparasite transmission. We have
shown that, in seven out of nine localities, the human ectopar-
asite model was the preferred model to explain the pattern of
plague mortality during an outbreak, rather than models of
pneumonic and rat–flea plague transmission (Table 3). The small
size of the plague outbreaks in Eyam and Givry made it difficult
to distinguish transmission routes based on mortality data. For
Eyam, both the human ectoparasite model and the pneumonic
model produced a similar quality fit for the observed mortality.
This agrees with a previous modeling study of Eyam (1665),
which found that the dominant mode of transmission was an
unspecified route of human-to-human transmission, rather than
rodent transmission (11). Overall, our results suggest that plague
transmission in European epidemics occurred predominantly through
human ectoparasites, rather than commensal rat or pneumonic
transmission.
The strength of our study is that we compared three plague
transmission models, each representing a known or hypothetical
mode of plague transmission, for nine plague outbreaks across the
spatial and temporal extent of the Second Pandemic in Europe.
Our study thus provides a more general understanding of plague
epidemics in Europe than previous modeling studies that focus on
single outbreaks, or single transmission routes (11, 20, 35, 36, 51).
However, since we considered nine outbreaks over several centu-
ries, we were limited to using simple models that could be applied
systematically. Consequently, these models did not account for local
conditions that can affect disease transmission, like war, famine,
immunity, and public health interventions. Additionally, we did not
model mixed transmission routes, and this makes it difficult to fully
assess the contribution of pneumonic plague, which commonly
occurs during bubonic outbreaks (52). Secondary pneumonic pla-
gue develops in an estimated 20% of bubonic cases, and this creates
potential for primary pneumonic spread, even if it is not the
dominant transmission route (52). Finally, we do not consider
events leading up to the introduction of the disease and our results
cannot be extended to plague transmission between localities,
which may have involved different transmission mechanisms.
Recent studies have found human ectoparasites during plague
outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo (41), Tanzania
(53), and Madagascar (54), but their role in these outbreaks is
not clear. In the absence of modern studies on human ectopar-
asites as vectors for plague, our results yield inferences about the
conditions necessary to produce outbreaks driven by human ec-
toparasite transmission. Our estimated values for R0 using the
human ectoparasite model were consistently between 1.5 and
1.9 for all nine cities. The main components of R0 in the human
ectoparasite model are the ectoparasite index and the trans-
mission rates (βl, βlow, βhigh). From the fitted models, we obtained
estimates for the transmission rates (βlow, βhigh) from humans to
ectoparasites during the early and late stages of plague infection.

Dean et al.
 We found that the majority of ectoparasite infections occurred
during the period of high infectivity in humans, consistent with
experimental evidence (40). Inferences like these not only im-
prove our understanding of human ectoparasites as plague vec-
tors in the past but also have important implications for limiting
the size of plague outbreaks today.
Many studies have sought to clarify the mechanisms un-
derlying the spread and maintenance of plague during the Sec-
ond Pandemic. Mathematical modeling is an important tool to
examine the role of different transmission mechanisms, partic-
ularly in the absence of definitive experimental, historical, and
archaeological information. Here, we demonstrate that human
ectoparasites appear to have been the dominant transmission
mode for plague during the Second Pandemic. This alternative
mode of transmission could account for many of the epidemio-
logical differences between the Second Pandemic and those
caused by rats during the Third Pandemic. Plague is undeniably a
disease of significant scientific, historic, and public interest, and
is still present in many parts of the world today. It is therefore
crucial that we understand the full spectrum of capabilities that
this versatile, pandemic disease has exhibited in the past.
