Yoga, a mind-body activity that requires attentional engagement, has been associated
with positive changes in brain structure and function, especially in areas related to
awareness, attention, executive functions and memory. Normal aging, on the other
hand, has also been associated with structural and functional brain changes, but
these generally involve decreased cognitive functions. The aim of this cross-sectional
study was to compare brain cortical thickness (CT) in elderly yoga practitioners and a
group of age-matched healthy non-practitioners. We tested 21 older women who had
practiced hatha yoga for at least 8 years and 21 women naive to yoga, meditation or
any mind-body interventions who were matched to the first group in age, years of formal
education and physical activity level. A T1-weighted MPRAGE sequence was acquired
for each participant. Yoga practitioners showed significantly greater CT in a left prefrontal
lobe cluster, which included portions of the lateral middle frontal gyrus, anterior superior
frontal gyrus and dorsal superior frontal gyrus. We found greater CT in the left prefrontal
cortex of healthy elderly women who trained yoga for a minimum of 8 years compared
with women in the control group.

INTRODUCTION
Aging is associated with changes in brain structure and function that may lead to cognitive losses,
physical and behavioral changes (Persson et al., 2006; Uranga et al., 2010; Lockhart and DeCarli,
2014). Cognitive impairment in aging includes a decrease in working memory (WM; Draganski
et al., 2013; Kirova et al., 2015) and in the volume of cortical areas recruited in attention tasks
(Bowman and Dennis, 2015). As longevity steadily increases in the general population worldwide
López-Otín et al. (2013), so does the incidence of age-related diseases, leading to higher medical
costs (Grootjans-van Kampen et al., 2014). With this in mind, yoga has been considered to be a
form of health-management intervention that is non-invasive as well as cost-effective (Aboagye
et al., 2015).
Yoga involves the practice of postures, breathing exercises and meditation. While
branches of yoga adopted in the West have a strong physical component (postures and
breathing exercises), yoga is not limited to the physical body. By definition, yoga is a
meditative activity embodied in physical postures in which an attentional component
must be present (Taimni, 1961). Therefore, yoga is considered a contemplative practice.

Cortical Thickness in Elderly Yoginis
Its
intrinsic
and
unique
contemplative
characteristics
distinguish it from typical forms of physical exercise, which are
limited to the physical body. Ross and Thomas (2010) suggested
that yoga has equal or greater effects on various health indicators
than
regular
aerobic
exercises.
Furthermore,
mind-body
practices such as yoga, tai chi and meditation have been
associated with positive changes in brain structure and function,
especially in areas related to awareness, attention, executive
functions and memory (Wei et al., 2013; Boccia et al., 2015).
Recent studies reported improvement in functional connectivity
(verbal, attentional and self-regulatory performance) in relation
to verbal memory assessed through the Hopkins Verbal
Learning Test-Revised and visuospatial memory measure,
the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Test for verbal memory in older
adults with mild cognition impairment who underwent yoga
interventions (Eyre et al., 2016). Villemure et al. (2015) and
Hernández et al. (2016) reported larger gray matter (GM)
volumes in practitioners of yoga and Sahaja Yoga Meditation,
respectively, compared with controls. To date, however, most
studies reporting morphometric differences between mind-body
intervention practitioners and non-practitioners have tested
small, heterogeneous samples (Boccia et al., 2015; Tang et al.,
2015). Moreover, many performed volumetric and region of
interest (ROI) analyses and showed mostly mixed results, with
different brain regions reported in different studies. There
are even fewer studies related to the practice of yoga and
morphometric differences in aging. As suggested above, it is
important to investigate the effects of yoga in an increasingly
older population. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare
brain cortical thickness (CT) in elderly female yoga practitioners
and healthy non-practitioners.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
Twenty-one female hatha yoga practitioners who practiced at
least twice a week for a minimum of 8 years, were recruited
from hatha yoga studios in São Paulo, Brazil. Hatha Yoga,
one of the most common yoga branches in the West, is
based on asana (postures), pranayama (breathing exercise)
and dhyana (meditation). We also recruited an additional
group of 21 women who were naive to yoga, meditation
or any mind-body intervention and were matched to the
first group in age, years of formal education and level of
physical activity. Subjects were matched for physical activity
based on the practices of the Yoga group—those who did
not practice any activity other than yoga were matched to
sedentary controls and those who practiced yoga plus another
physical activity were matched to a control group member who
practiced the same or equivalent physical activity. Inclusion
criteria were: at least 60 years of age, female, right-handed
and having completed at least elementary school. We chose
to include only women to add an element of homogeneity
to the group. Interestingly, it was also easier to identify
female yoga practitioners than male practitioners. Exclusion
criteria were: substance abuse; tremor or dystonia of the
head; chronic physical or other health problems that prevented
them from performing their daily activities independently; any
contraindication to MRI; a clinical history of neurological and/or
psychiatric diseases. All volunteers provided written informed
consent and the study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein (CAAE
22313813.7.0000.0071).
Questionnaires and Tests
Instrumental Activities of Daily Living—IADL: scores range
from 9 (low function) to 27 (high function). Items are
evaluated regarding individuals’ ability to perform each task
(independently, with others’ help, or not at all; Lawton and
Brody, 1969; Santos and Virtuoso, 2008).
Beck Depression Inventory—BDI: self-report questionnaire
with 21 multiple choice questions addressing several depression
symptoms. Scores range from 0 to 63 (Beck, 1978; Gorenstein
et al., 1999).
Mini Mental State Examination—MMSE: test that evaluates
several domains of cognitive function, such as spatial and
temporal
orientation;
calculation;
immediate
and
evoked
memory; language-naming; writing; repetition and copying
a drawing. Scores range from 0 to 30 (Folstein et al.,
1975).
Anthropometric measurements—Weight and height were
measured.
Image Acquisition
A T1-weighted MPRAGE sequence was acquired for each
participant using a Siemens 3.0T Magnetom Tim Trio System
with a 12-channel head receive coil (matrix 1 × 1 × 1 mm
voxel, TR = 2500 ms, TE = 3.45 ms, FOV = 265 mm,
inversion time = 1100, flip angle = 7 degrees). Image
quality
was
visually
inspected
immediately
after
each
structural acquisition to control for motion effects and other
artifacts.
Cortical Thickness (CT) Analysis
The FreeSurfer analysis suite (v5.3.0 release1) was used to
derive models of cortical surface in each T1-weighted image.
These validated and fully automated procedures have been
extensively described elsewhere (e.g., Dale et al., 1999; Fischl
and Dale, 2000). In brief, a single filled white matter
volume was generated for each hemisphere after intensity
normalization, skull stripping, and image segmentation using a
connected components algorithm. Then, a surface tessellation
was generated for each white matter volume by fitting a
deformable template. This resulted in a triangular cortical mesh
for gray and white matter surfaces consisting of approximately
150,000 vertices (i.e., points) per hemisphere. Measures of CT
were computed as the closest distance from the GM and white
matter boundary to the GM and cerebrospinal fluid boundary
at each vertex on the tesselated surface. Mean CT across the
entire brain was also computed for each participant. Thickness
data were smoothed using a 15-mm surface-based smoothing
kernel.

FIGURE 1 | Differences in cortical thickness (CT) between yoginis and controls
(P < 0.05, cluster corrected). Yoga practitioners showed greater CT in a
cluster in the left prefrontal cortex (RTF-based, cluster-corrected, p < 0.05).
Statistical Analyses of the Images
Whole-brain CT analysis was then performed on each vertex
using the general linear model (GLM) embedded in the SurfStat
toolbox2 for Matlab (R2010b; MathWorks). Participants’ age
was included as a covariate to control for the effect of age
on brain structure. CT was compared in yoga practitioners vs.
non-practitioners. We also examined different age effects on
CT between groups by conducting a group by age interaction.
Corrections for multiple comparisons across the whole brain
were performed using random-field theory (RFT) cluster-extent
based thresholding for nonisotropic images (Worsley et al.,
1999). Group differences in mean CT were assessed by an
independent samples t-test.

RESULTS
The yoga group had 14.9 years of hatha yoga practice, on average.
There were no significant differences between groups in terms of
age, years of education, questionnaire scores or anthropometrical
measures, as shown in Table 1.

Between-Group Differences in Cortical
Thickness
Relative to controls, yoga practitioners (i.e., female yoga
practitioners) showed a significantly greater CT in a left
prefrontal lobe cluster (cluster forming threshold p < 0.05,
cluster corrected p-value = 0.01574), which included anterior
and lateral portions of middle and superior frontal gyri (BA8/9;
Figure 1, Table 2). No regions exhibited decreased CT in yoginis
compared to controls. The age by group interaction was also not
significant. There were no significant between-group differences
in mean CT for the whole cortex, as assessed for each hemisphere
individually (t(40) = −0.690, p = 0.494).
DISCUSSION
In the present cross-sectional study, we observed greater CT
in the left prefrontal cortex (middle and superior frontal gyri)
of healthy elderly women who trained yoga for a minimum
of 8 years compared with women in the control group. The
present results parallel those previously reported in which
younger yoga and meditation practitioners had greater GM
volumes than non-practitioners compared to non-practitioners
in the following brain regions: larger GM volume in the right
anterior insula and right inferior temporal gyrus (Hernández
et al., 2016), increased GM volume in the frontal lobe (right
anterior cingulate cortex and left middle and medial frontal
gyrus), left precuneus and fusiform gyrus and right thalamus
(Boccia et al., 2015), increased GM volume in the left mid insula,
left frontal operculum, left orbitofrontal cortex, right middle
temporal gyrus and right primary somatosensory cortex/superior
parietal lobule (Villemure et al., 2015). Our sample consisted of
healthy elderly Brazilian women with 14.3 years of education,
on average (which is high compared to the national average of
4.7 years among people over 60 years of age; IBGE—Instituto
Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística, 2014). The volunteers in
this study did not present any severe cognitive impairments,
as assessed by the MMSE, nor any problems associated with
functionality in daily life activities (as assessed with the IADL).
Importantly, no participants displayed any depressive symptoms,
as these may be associated with cognitive alterations (McClintock
et al., 2010; Dong et al., 2016), or with an early manifestation
of dementia (Panza et al., 2010). Therefore, it is unlikely that
the differences observed between groups are due to demographic
characteristics or depressive symptoms.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first imaging
study showing greater CT in elderly female yoga practitioners
relative to controls. The greater thickness was observed in
left prefrontal lobe areas associated with attention and other
executive functions (Jeon, 2014). When performing a yoga
posture, muscles are engaged for a minimum amount of time
in a state of attention (processed in the prefrontal cortex,
PFC), similarly to what occurs in meditation (Kane and Engle,
2002; Koechlin et al., 2003). The meditative process (for which
attention is essential) is associated with increased oxyhemoglobin
concentrations in the PFC due to the increased blood flow to
that region (Deepeshwar et al., 2015; Singh et al., 2016). Similarly,
alterations in attention and cognition result in different degrees
of electrical activity in the PFC (Aftanas and Golocheikine, 2001;
Davidson et al., 2003; Lutz et al., 2004; Desai et al., 2015).
In our study, we observed alterations in areas associated with
executive functions of attentional control rather than motor
regions.
Other attentional tasks such as video game playing, cause
changes in cognition in older adults (Toril et al., 2014)
and brain structure of adolescents, with positive correlation
between CT and hour per week of video game in the left
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in left middle frontal gyrus and
left frontal eye fields (Kühn et al., 2014). Playing video game
may lead to addiction and its deleterious effects, however, yoga
is associated with improvement in mental health, therefore
different psychobiological mechanisms should be involved
in these trainings (Cramer et al., 2013; Pascoe and Bauer,
2015).
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is related
to differences in brain structure and function when compared
to controls (Batty et al., 2015; Silk et al., 2016). Yang et al.
(2015) and showed thinner superior frontal gyrus in the right
hemisphere in children with ADHD compared to healthy
controls. Hoekzema et al. (2012) observed reduced laminar
CT in a bilateral area from the superior frontal gyrus to the
precentral gyrus, inferior and superior parietal cortex. Some
of these morphometric abnormalities in ADHD are associated
to attention and WM. Furthermore, du Boisgueheneuc et al.
(2006) observed that WM was compromised in patients with
lesions in the left superior frontal gyrus, one of the regions
where we found greater CT in our study. WM allows temporary
storage of data and directs attention to relevant information
(Baddeley, 1992; Cowan, 2008). It is, therefore, an essential
resource of meditative processes, where the object of attention
(i.e., breathing) becomes the meaningful content. Moreover, WM
capacity decreases with age (Sander et al., 2012). Thus, while
aging is associated with a decrease in GM volume in the frontal
lobes (Tisserand and Jolles, 2003; Salat et al., 2004; Lockhart
and DeCarli, 2014) along with WM deterioration, the practice
of yoga appears to have neuroprotective effects, thus having a
positive impact on mental health among the elderly. We believe
that yoga may preserve cognition, which is supported by our
findings as well as previous results in which younger yoga
and meditation practitioners showed sharper cognitive functions
relative to controls. Eyre et al. (2016) showed that older adults
with mild cognitive impairment who practiced 12 weeks of yoga
had improvement in functional connectivity (verbal, attentional,
and self-regulatory performance) in relation to verbal memory
assessed through the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test–Revised and
a visuospatial memory measure, the Rey-Osterrieth Complex
Test. Considering Taichi chuan a mind-body activity, therefore
a mental training, similar to yoga, there were differences in
the cortex performing vertex-wise analyses. Wei et al. (2013)
reported thicker cortex in Taichi chuan practitioners compared
to control group: medial occipitotemporal sulcus, superior
temporal gyrus and lingual sulcus in left hemisphere and the
circular sulcus of the insula, precentral gyrus and middle frontal
sulcus in right hemisphere. Furthermore, Gard et al. (2014)
showed that meditation may reduce cognitive decline associated
with normal aging, and Sharma et al. (2014) observed greater
enhancement in cognitive domains such as memory retention
and attention in yoga practitioners relative to controls. Gothe
et al. (2014) found that yoga practitioners had greater WM
capacity compared with a control group that did stretching and
strengthening exercises. In that study, the different results may
be due to the attention/awareness component found in yoga
but not in stretching and strengthening. Chandra et al. (2016)
also reported greater WM capacity in Sudarshan Kriya yoga
practitioners. Even though the studies mentioned above detected
cognitive alterations, they did not perform imaging tests.
Our study has some limitations. Ideally, individuals across
groups should have performed the same physical activities
(other than yoga). Matching participants on this variable
proved to be very difficult. Thus, we matched as best we
could based on relative physical effort. Furthermore, as the
number of participants in each group was relatively small, it
did not allow us to make comparisons between individuals
from different ethnic groups. Also, our volunteers performed
only one MRI scan. Future studies should involve longitudinal
randomized controlled trials and correlations with other
peripheral measures.
In conclusion, healthy elderly women who practiced hatha
yoga for at least 8 years had greater prefrontal CT than a group
of matched controls. This CT may be associated with cognitive
preservation.
