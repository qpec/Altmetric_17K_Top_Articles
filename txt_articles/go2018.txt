IMPORTANCE Atrial fibrillation is a potent risk factor for stroke, but whether the burden of
atrial fibrillation in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation independently influences the
risk of thromboembolism remains controversial.
OBJECTIVE To determine if the burden of atrial fibrillation characterized using noninvasive,
continuous ambulatory monitoring is associated with the risk of ischemic stroke or arterial
thromboembolism in adults with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study conducted from
October 2011 and October 2016 at 2 large integrated health care delivery systems used an
extended continuous cardiac monitoring system to identify adults who were found to have
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on 14-day continuous ambulatory electrocardiographic
monitoring.
EXPOSURES The burden of atrial fibrillation was defined as the percentage of analyzable wear
time in atrial fibrillation or flutter during the up to 14-day monitoring period.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Ischemic stroke and other arterial thromboembolic events
occurring while patients were not taking anticoagulation were identified through November
2016 using electronic medical records and were validated by manual review. We evaluated
the association of the burden of atrial fibrillation with thromboembolism while not taking
anticoagulation after adjusting for the Anticoagulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation
(ATRIA) or CHA2DS2-VASc stroke risk scores.
RESULTS Among 1965 adults with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, the mean (SD) age was
69 (11.8) years, 880 (45%) were women, 496 (25%) were persons of color, the median ATRIA
stroke risk score was 4 (interquartile range [IQR], 2-7), and the median CHA2DS2-VASc score
was 3 (IQR, 1-4). The median burden of atrial fibrillation was 4.4% (IQR ,1.1%-17.23%). Patients
with a higher burden of atrial fibrillation were less likely to be women or of Hispanic ethnicity,
but had more prior cardioversion attempts compared with those who had a lower burden.
After adjusting for either ATRIA or CHA2DS2-VASc stroke risk scores, the highest tertile of
atrial fibrillation burden (�11.4%) was associated with a more than 3-fold higher adjusted rate
of thromboembolism while not taking anticoagulants (adjusted hazard ratios, 3.13 [95% CI,
1.50-6.56] and 3.16 [95% CI, 1.51-6.62], respectively) compared with the combined lower
2 tertiles of atrial fibrillation burden. Results were consistent across demographic and clinical
subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A greater burden of atrial fibrillation is associated with a
higher risk of ischemic stroke independent of known stroke risk factors in adults with
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

trial fibrillation increases the risk for ischemic stroke
and other arterial thromboembolism and affects mil-
lionsofUSadults.1-3Atrialfibrillationcanleadtothrom-
bus development within the atria, particularly the left atrial
appendage, which can cause thromboembolic events.4,5
Whether thromboembolic risk varies among those with
paroxysmal vs nonparoxysmal atrial fibrillation has been an
ongoing question. Compared with patients with nonparoxys-
mal atrial fibrillation, those with paroxysmal atrial fibrilla-
tion may be at higher thromboembolic risk given intermit-
tentorganizedcontractionoftheatriafollowingperiodsofatrial
fibrillation. However, a recent meta-analysis suggested that
there is a higher risk in patients with nonparoxysmal vs par-
oxysmal atrial fibrillation not taking anticoagulants,6 but cur-
rent guidelines recommend anticoagulants for stroke preven-
tion based on clinical risk stratification for either
nonparoxysmal or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.7 Yet, little is
known about whether the burden of atrial fibrillation (ie, the
amount of time spent in atrial fibrillation) independently in-
creasestheriskofstrokeamongpatientswithparoxysmalatrial
fibrillation for whom decision making about stroke preven-
tion strategies can be challenging. Previous studies have fo-
cused on selected populations with implanted devices, such
as pacemakers,8-14 implantable cardioverter defibrillators,11-14
or cardiac resynchronization therapy devices,15 with varying
thresholds for defining a meaningful amount of time in atrial
fibrillation during long-term monitoring. Furthermore, stud-
ies have not examined the effect of the burden of atrial fibril-
lation measured using short-term, continuous, noninvasive
strategies on the risk of stroke and other thromboembolic
events while not taking anticoagulation. Within a large co-
hort with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation confirmed on ex-
tended continuous ambulatory electrocardiographic monitor-
ing, we evaluated whether a greater burden of atrial fibrillation
was independently associated with the risk of stroke and ar-
terial thromboembolism while not taking anticoagulants to as-
sist in improving stroke risk stratification.
Methods
Source Population
The source population included members of Kaiser Perma-
nente Northern California and Southern California, 2 inte-
gratedhealthcaredeliverysystemsprovidingcaretomorethan
8 million persons. The membership is highly representative
of the statewide population in regard to age, sex, race/
ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.16-18 The project was ap-
proved by the Kaiser Permanente Northern and Southern Cali-
fornia institutional review boards, and a waiver of informed
consent was obtained due to the nature of the study.
Design and Analytic Sample
The Kaiser Permanente Real-World Heart Monitoring Strat-
egy Evaluation, Treatment Patterns, and Health Metrics in
Atrial Fibrillation (KP-RHYTHM) study first identified all adult
members who underwent continuous ambulatory electrocar-
diographic monitoring using the ZIO service (iRhythm Tech-
nologies Inc) between October 2011 and October 2016. The ZIO
Patch is a lightweight, lead wire–free, single-patient-use elec-
trocardiographic monitor that is applied to the left upper chest
and records and stores up to 14 days of continuous, beat-to-
beat electrocardiographic data. After mailing the monitor back
to iRhythm Technologies, Inc., the recording is analyzed using
proprietary algorithms with verification of the algorithm out-
put and report creation by conducted by certified cardiac
technicians.13,14 The report is then transferred to the treating
physician.
As the aim of this study was to examine the relationship
oftheburdenofatrialfibrillationwiththromboembolismwhile
not receiving anticoagulation therapy in adults with paroxys-
mal atrial fibrillation, we identified patients with confirmed
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (>0% and <100% overall bur-
den)onZIOPatchelectrocardiographicmonitoring.13,14Forany
episode to be labeled as atrial fibrillation (which included atrial
flutter),theminimumepisodedurationwaslongerthan30sec-
onds. We excluded patients younger than age 18 years at the
time of monitoring and those with fewer than 12 months of
prior continuous membership or pharmacy benefit, disenroll-
ment after device removal, death during the monitoring pe-
riod, prior organ transplant, no analyzable wear time, or no pe-
riods of not taking anticoagulation during follow-up.
Predictor Variable
The primary predictor was the burden of atrial fibrillation in
the setting of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. To compare pa-
tients wearing the ZIO Patch for different lengths of time (up
to 14 days), we examined 2 measures of atrial fibrillation bur-
den. Our primary measure was the percentage of analyzable
wear time spent in atrial fibrillation; the secondary measure
was the longest continuous episode of atrial fibrillation dur-
ing monitoring.
Follow-up
Follow-up occurred from the end of ZIO Patch monitoring
through November 30, 2016. Patients were censored for death
(n = 58 [3.0%]), health plan disenrollment (n = 82 [4.2%]), or-
gan transplant (n = 4 [0.2%]) or end of follow-up (n = 1778
[90.5%]). Of note, patients who were censored because of
Key Points
Question Is the burden of atrial fibrillation associated with the risk
of ischemic stroke and other thromboembolism in paroxysmal
atrial fibrillation?
Findings In a cohort study of 1965 adults with paroxysmal atrial
fibrillation, a greater burden of atrial fibrillation (�11%) on 14-day
noninvasive, continuous electrocardiographic monitoring was
associated with a significantly higher rate of thromboembolism
while not taking anticoagulation vs a lower burden.
Meaning Greater atrial fibrillation burden is associated with a
higher risk of ischemic stroke independent of known risk factors in
adults with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation; knowing the burden of
atrial fibrillation may assist with shared decision making for stroke
prevention strategies.

 health plan disenrollment were younger and had less comor-
bidity burden. Deaths were ascertained from electronic medi-
cal records, Social Security Administration files,19 and Cali-
fornia state death certificate files.20
Outcomes
The outcome of interest included hospitalization for ische-
mic stroke or arterial thromboembolism while not taking an-
ticoagulants. We searched hospital discharge and emergency
department databases for diagnostic codes for potential events
using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth
Edition codes (data not shown).21,22 Medical records were ad-
judicated by physicians using standardized criteria as previ-
ously described.21,22 A thromboembolic event included ische-
micstrokedefinedasanacuteneurologicaldeficitlastingmore
than 24 hours that was not explained by other causes (eg, pri-
mary intracranial hemorrhage, trauma, infection, or vasculi-
tis); transient ischemic attack, which included the same defi-
nition of ischemic stroke but with a 24-hour or less duration;
and other symptomatic arterial thromboembolism con-
firmed by radiographic imaging, intraoperative examination,
or pathological findings in the absence of underlying athero-
sclerotic disease in the affected artery. Only events that oc-
curred while the patient was not taking anticoagulants that
were confirmed by medical records were included. Warfarin
exposure was based on a previously validated algorithm using
pharmacy dispensings and intervening international normal-
ized ratio measurements23; exposure to direct oral anticoagu-
lants was based on the information on the number of days sup-
plied per the dispensed prescription.
Covariates
We identified age, sex, and self-reported race/ethnicity from
health plan databases. We identified stroke risk factors from
electronic medical records using previously described
methods.22Theseincludedpriorischemicstroke,chronicheart
failure, diabetes, hypertension, and reduced kidney func-
tion. Reduced kidney function included an estimated glomer-
ularfiltrationratelessthan45ml/min/1.73m2usingtheChronic
Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration estimating
equation,24 as well as proteinuria ascertained from urine dip-
stick results of 1+ or greater.25 We also calculated each pa-
tient’
s predicted risk of thromboembolism using the Antico-
agulation and Risk Factors in Atrial Fibrillation (ATRIA) and
CHA2DS2-VASc scores. The ATRIA stroke risk score, which has
a range of 0 to 15 (low risk = 0-5, moderate risk = 6, and high
risk ≥ 7), has been shown to have greater discrimination than
otherriskschemesinmultiplepopulationsintheUnitedStates,
United Kingdom, and Sweden.22,26,27 The CHA2DS2-VASc risk
score,28 which has a range of 0 to 9 (low risk = 0), has been in-
corporated into various clinical guidelines.7
We assessed for missingness in the variables presented in
the Table and found that 266 (12.5%) in the cohort were miss-
ing an estimated glomerular filtration rate and 10 (0.5%) in the
cohort had no recordings of the longest episode of atrial fibril-
lation. In an earlier period, we showed that warfarin was ob-
tained through non–health plan pharmacies for fewer than 6%
of adults with atrial fibrillation.21 For medical conditions, in-
cluding proteinuria, we classified patients with no docu-
mented evidence as not having the condition of interest.
Analytic Approach
All analyses were conducted using SAS software, version 9.3
(SAS Institute.). Given the non-normal distribution of the bur-
den of atrial fibrillation, we compared baseline characteris-
tics across tertiles of atrial fibrillation burden using analyses
ofvarianceornonparametrictestsforcontinuousvariablesand
χ2 tests for categorical variables. We used a Poisson regres-
sion to estimate the annual incidence of confirmed thrombo-
emboliceventsforperiodsduringfollow-upwhilepatientswere
not taking anticoagulation as a rate per 100 person-years with
95% confidence limits, overall and by tertile of the burden of
atrial fibrillation. We conducted separate Cox regression mod-
els for the primary and secondary measures of atrial fibrilla-
tion burden with thromboembolism using time not taking an-
ticoagulation as our analytic timeline, unadjusted and after
adjustment for either ATRIA or CHA2DS2-VASc risk score as a
continuous variable (eFigure in the Supplement). In addi-
tion,weperformedsubgroupanalysesbyage,sex,andthepres-
ence or absence of chronic kidney disease, diabetes, or hyper-
tension. Finally, we conducted sensitivity analyses in which
we separately excluded patients with a previous ischemic
stroke or those who had baseline exposure to anticoagulants,
with censoring at the time of anticoagulant initiation during
follow-up.

patients who had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation during up to 14
days of undergoing continuous ambulatory electrocardio-

low-up(Figure1).Overall,themean(SD)agewas69(11.8)years,

cluded a lower prevalence of women, Hispanic race/
ethnicity, a higher prevalence of prior cardioversion at-
tempts, and anticoagulant use within 30 days after monitoring
with a higher tertile of atrial fibrillation burden (Table).
Atrial Fibrillation Burden Distribution
The burden of atrial fibrillation was non-normally distrib-
uted, with a median (IQR) of 4.4% (1.1%-17.2%) (Figure 2). The
median (IQR) duration of the longest continuous episode of
atrial fibrillation was 171 (49-590) minutes.
Atrial Fibrillation Burden and Thromboembolic Risk

tients were not taking anticoagulation, with a median (IQR)
time between the end of electrocardiographic monitoring to
the thromboembolic event of 8 (2-15) months. During 1915 per-
son years of follow-up while patients were not taking antico-
agulation, the unadjusted thromboembolism incidence while
not taking anticoagulation was 1.51 per 100 person-years (95%
CI,1.05-2.18) (Figure 3). Across tertiles of burden of atrial fi-
brillation, the unadjusted thromboembolism incidence while
not taking anticoagulation was higher in the highest tertile of
burden of atrial fibrillation (Figure 3).
We compared patients within the combined first and sec-
ond tertiles with those in the third tertile of burden of atrial
fibrillation and found a 215% (95% CI, 51%-561%) increase in
the unadjusted risk of thromboembolic events while not tak-
ing anticoagulation (Figure 4A). Adjusting for ATRIA or

sults (Figure 4A). Analyses in the subgroups of age, sex, and

 the presence or absence of chronic kidney disease or hyper-
tension, as well as in those without diabetes, demonstrated
similar associations and there were no significant interac-
tions (Figure 4B). Results were similar in patients without pre-
vious ischemic stroke (eTable 1 in the Supplement), and the
association was stronger among patients with no baseline or
follow-up exposure to anticoagulants (eTable 2 in the Supple-
ment). In contrast, a secondary measure of atrial fibrillation
burden—thedurationofthelongestobservedepisode—wasnot

Discussion
Among a contemporary population of adults with confirmed
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, a greater cumulative burden of
atrial fibrillation that was identified using up to 14-day con-
tinuous, noninvasive electrocardiographic monitoring was in-
dependently associated with a higher risk of subsequent is-
chemicstrokeorarterialthromboembolismwhilepatientswere
not taking anticoagulation, even after adjusting for known
strokeriskfactors.Furthermore,resultswereconsistentacross
key subgroups. In contrast, the duration of the longest con-
tinuous episode of atrial fibrillation during the monitoring pe-
riod did not predict subsequent thromboembolism.
We uniquely examined the prospective association be-
tween the burden of atrial fibrillation using a noninvasive,
short-term continuous monitoring approach and the subse-
quent risk of thromboembolism in paroxysmal atrial fibrilla-
tion. In contrast, the limitations of previous studies include
examining only selected samples of patients who were receiv-
ing invasive, expensive implanted devices; using a range of
thresholds for defining a meaningful burden of atrial fibrilla-
tion and the variable duration of follow-up; not restricting to
periods during which patients were not taking anticoagula-
tion; or not always validating ischemic stroke and other throm-
boembolicevents.Inapooledanalysis29of10 016patientswith
cardiac implantable electronic devices (ie, dual-chamber pace-
maker, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, or a cardiac re-

ated device-detected atrial tachyarrhythmias and thrombo-
embolic risk in patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial
fibrillation. In this analysis, the rate of ischemic stroke or tran-
sient ischemic attack was low, ranging from 0.32 per 100 per-
son-years for having 0 to fewer than 5 total minutes to 0.49
per 100 person-years for having 23 or more total hours of atrial
fibrillation.29 After adjusting for the CHADS2 score and the re-

 brillation was associated with a higher risk of stroke as a con-
tinuousmeasure(hazardratio[HR],1.03perhour;95%CI,1.00-
1.05) and using prespecified cutoffs of 1 hour or longer (HR,
2.11; 95% CI, 1.22-3.64) and 5 minutes or longer (HR, 1.76; 95%
CI, 1.02-3.02).29 In the Atrial Fibrillation Reduction Atrial Pac-
ing Trial (ASSERT) of 2580 patients with a pacemaker or car-
dioverter defibrillator and no prior atrial fibrillation or atrial
flutter, asymptomatic atrial tachyarrhythmias lasting longer
than 6 minutes during a 3-month monitoring period were as-
sociated with a higher adjusted rate of ischemic stroke or sys-
temic embolism (HR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.28-4.85).13 However, this
study was not focused on patients with paroxysmal atrial fi-
brillation and did not characterize the burden of atrial fibril-
lation. A case-crossover analysis examined 187 veterans who
had a cardiac implantable electronic device and experienced
an ischemic stroke.11 A positive burden of atrial fibrillation was
defined as having 5.5 or more hours of atrial fibrillation on any
day in the 30 days before the stroke. Among 16 patients who
had discordance in having a positive burden in the 30 days vs
no atrial fibrillation in the 91 to 120 days before their stroke, a
positive burden of recent atrial fibrillation was associated with
an elevated risk of stroke after adjusting for warfarin use (ad-
justed odds ratio, 5.22; 95% CI, 1.22-47.4). However, preci-
sionwaslimitedandthestudywasnotfocusedonpatientswith
known paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.11 In contrast, among 178
patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction, prior
atrial fibrillation, and an implanted cardiac resynchroniza-
tion therapy device, experiencing atrial high-rate events of 1%
or more during a 24-hour period was not significantly associ-
ated with a higher rate of thromboembolism.15 Our study ma-
terially extends previous efforts by focusing on a widely avail-
able, noninvasive extended monitoring strategy in patients
with confirmed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation using a com-
mon metric of burden of atrial fibrillation that was standard-
ized across patients and also demonstrates the independent
prognostic information of atrial fibrillation burden beyond
known stroke risk factors.
Our analysis was strengthened by including a diverse,
community-basedsampleofcontemporaryadultswithparoxys-
mal atrial fibrillation. We systematically captured thromboem-
boliceventsthatwerevalidatedbyphysicianreviewusingstan-
dardizedclinicalcriteriaandconfirmedthatthethromboembolic

patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation may be less likely to
receiveantithrombotictherapycomparedwithpatientswhohave
nonparoxysmal atrial fibrillation, regardless of underlying pre-
dicted stroke risk.32
Limitations
Our analysis had several limitations. Information on the
exact reasons for undergoing arrhythmia monitoring and for
not receiving anticoagulation was unavailable. Given the
number of events, we had limited power to determine
thromboembolic risk at more granular cutoffs of atrial fibril-
lation burden, but our data suggested a threshold of approxi-
mately 11% as meaningful in the overall cohort and across
age, sex, and subgroups without diabetes, chronic kidney
disease, and hypertension. We were underpowered to evalu-
ate the association of atrial fibrillation burden with thrombo-
embolism in this subset of patients with a CHA2DS2-VASc
score of 0 or 1. Patients in the highest tertile of atrial fibrilla-
tion burden were more likely to receive anticoagulation,
which led to modestly fewer person-years while not taking
anticoagulation in this subgroup (586) than those in the first
(690) or second (639) tertiles, but this would bias the asso-
ciation between atrial fibrillation burden and thromboembo-
lism toward the null. While a greater burden of atrial fibrilla-
tion could theoretically lead to longer periods of blood
stasis, the promotion of thrombus generation, and the devel-
opment of worsening of certain stroke risk factors (eg, heart
failure or impaired kidney function), we were unable to

 determine if the burden of atrial fibrillation is a marker of
risk or causative. Although we studied primarily insured
adults in California, our results are likely to be generalizable
to other populations and practice settings. Our analysis that
examined any intermittent periods of time not taking antico-
agulation during follow-up as a continuous period for an
individual patient was based on the assumption of a con-
stant hazard of the outcome, which may not be true; how-
ever, we did not find any evidence of violation of the propor-
tionality assumption. Our continuous electrocardiographic
monitoring strategy was only up to 14 days, so we were
unable to evaluate the potential value of longer (or shorter)
periods to characterize the burden of atrial fibrillation.
Finally, as stroke risk factors can accumulate over time in
patients, risk stratification is a dynamic process and further
study is needed to evaluate the incremental utility of
repeated episodes of characterizing atrial fibrillation burden.
Conclusions
In conclusion, a greater burden of atrial fibrillation identified
using a noninvasive, 14-day continuous monitoring strategy
is associated with a higher risk of ischemic stroke and arterial
thromboembolism in adults with paroxysmal atrial fibrilla-
tion that is independent of known stroke risk factors. Charac-
terizing the burden of atrial fibrillation in patients with par-
oxysmal atrial fibrillation could assist patients and physicians
in having a more informed, shared decision-making discus-
sion about stroke prevention strategies.
