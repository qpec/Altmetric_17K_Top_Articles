ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To determine the association between exposure to 
radiotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer and 
subsequent second malignancies (second primary 
cancers).
Design
Systematic review and meta-analysis of observational 
studies.
Data sOurCes
Medline and Embase up to 6 April 2015 with no 
restrictions on year or language.
stuDy seleCtiOn
Comparative studies assessing the risk of second 
malignancies in patients exposed or unexposed to 
radiotherapy in the course of treatment for prostate 
cancer were selected by two reviewers independently 
with any disagreement resolved by consensus.
Data extraCtiOn anD synthesis
Two reviewers independently extracted study 
characteristics and outcomes. Risk of bias was 
assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Outcomes 
were synthesized with random effects models and 
Mantel-Haenszel weighting. Unadjusted odds ratios 
and multivariable adjusted hazard ratios, when 
available, were pooled.
Main OutCOMe Measures
Second cancers of the bladder, colorectal tract, 
rectum, lung, and hematologic system.
results
Of 3056 references retrieved, 21 studies were selected 
for analysis. Most included studies were large 
multi-institutional reports but had moderate risk of 
bias. The most common type of radiotherapy was 
external beam; 13 studies used patients treated with 
surgery as controls and eight used patients who did 
not undergo radiotherapy as controls. The length of 
follow-up among studies varied. There was increased 
risk of cancers of the bladder (four studies; adjusted 
hazard ratio 1.67, 95% confidence interval 1.55 to 1.80), 
colorectum (three studies; 1.79, 1.34 to 2.38), and 
rectum (three studies; 1.79, 1.34 to 2.38), but not 
cancers of the hematologic system (one study; 1.64, 
0.90 to 2.99) or lung (two studies; 1.45, 0.70 to 3.01), 
after radiotherapy compared with the risk in those 
unexposed to radiotherapy. The odds of a second 
cancer varied depending on type of radiotherapy: 
treatment with external beam radiotherapy was 
consistently associated with increased odds while 
brachytherapy was not. Among the patients who 
underwent radiotherapy, from individual studies, the 
highest absolute rates reported for bladder, colorectal, 
and rectal cancers were 3.8%, 4.2%, and 1.2%, 
respectively, while the lowest reported rates were 
0.1%, 0.3%, and 0.3%.
COnClusiOn
Radiotherapy for prostate cancer was associated with 
higher risks of developing second malignancies of the 
bladder, colon, and rectum compared with patients 
unexposed to radiotherapy, but the reported absolute 
rates were low. Further studies with longer follow-up 
are required to confirm these findings.
Introduction
Treatment options for patients with a diagnosis with 
clinically localized prostate cancer can include surgery 
or radiotherapy.1 Each option is associated with side 
effects including urinary incontinence and erectile dys-
function.2 3 Recently, other complications related to 
treatment and resulting in hospital admissions, genito-
urinary and recto-anal procedures, and major surgeries 
have been described.4-6 A unique complication for 
patients undergoing radiotherapy is the possibility of 
development of a secondary malignancy (second pri-
mary cancer).
Studies assessing the risk of secondary cancers after 
radiotherapy for prostate cancer have reported either 
an increased risk of secondary malignancies7 8 or no 
association between radiotherapy and secondary 
malignancies.9 
10  One previous review concluded a neg-
ligible risk of secondary malignancies after radiother-
apy,11  whereas other reviews concluded that this is an 
important risk for both patients and physicians to con-
sider.12-14 A previous meta-analysis lacked data from 
several important recent publications.15
While direct radiation carcinogenesis has long been 
accepted,16  there is evidence that irradiation of the 
prostate might contribute to carcinogenesis outside the 
irradiated area through radiation scatter and radiation 
induced genetic alterations without direct exposure 
because of increased reactive oxygen species17-19 and

changes in gene expression in what has been termed 
the “bystander effect.”20 We therefore carried out a sys-
tematic review and meta-analysis of available data on 
the association between radiotherapy and the develop-
ment of secondary malignancies of the bladder, col-
orectal tract, lung, and hematological system in 
patients with prostate cancer compared with other 
treatments.
Methods
Participants and exposure
We reviewed studies reporting on patients with con-
firmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with 
commonly used forms of radiotherapy including con-
formal external beam, intensity modulated, brachyther-
apy, or a combination of types. We included studies 
irrespective of dose and duration of radiotherapy. Con-
trols were patients who did not undergo radiotherapy, 
including those who were treated with surgery, other 
treatments for prostate cancer, or received no treat-
ment. We conducted a subgroup analysis using only 
controls treated with surgery. When the comparator 
group was unclear, we excluded the study.
Outcome
Our primary outcome was the development of one or 
more histologically unique secondary cancers of the 
bladder, colorectal tract, rectum, lung, and hematologic 
system, excluding metastatic tumors. Studies reporting 
on rectal cancer were included in the analysis of colorec-
tal cancer as well as in the analysis of rectal cancer.
It is argued that time (lag period) must elapse 
between the date of exposure to radiation and the 
development of a secondary cancer for that tumor to be 
considered induced by radiation.13 Historically, this has 
been defined as five years.13 
21-23 There were differences 
in the use and application of the length of the lag period 
from the time of treatment to diagnosis of secondary 
cancer among included studies. To deal with differ-
ences in how studies handled the lag period, we con-
ducted separate analyses stratified by inclusion without 
respect to lag period to only those using a five year lag 
period and to only those using a 10 year lag period.
types of studies
We included cohort and case control studies. We 
excluded case series that lacked comparator patients 
who did not undergo radiotherapy. Other publications 
on the topic, including basic science papers, review 
articles, editorials, articles not dealing with radiation 
induced malignancy, conference abstracts, early ver-
sions of data later published, and non-standard treat-
ment (such as cryotherapy) were excluded (fig 1). When 
there was more than one publication resulting from the 
same cohort of patients, to prevent the duplication of 
patients from one cohort, for each of our analyses we 
selected one study based on a hierarchical assessment 
of comparability of study groups, definition of radiation 
exposure, time period of study (preference for more 
recent), and number of patients (appendix 1).
Methods of review
We used Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Meta-analy-
sis of Observational studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) 
guidelines for reporting of this systematic review and 
meta-analysis.24

search strategy
With the help of a professional librarian we searched 
Medline and Embase databases using the OvidSP 
search platform for studies indexed up to 6 April 2015. 
Appendix 2 shows the detailed search strategy for each 
database. References from review articles, editorials, 
and included studies were reviewed and cross refer-
enced to ensure completeness. Studies in any language 
were included. Conference abstracts were excluded.
selection and data extraction
Two authors (CJDW and ALM) performed study selec-
tion. Titles and abstracts were screened for initial study 
inclusion, with full text review when the abstract was 
insufficient to determine if the study met the inclusion 
or exclusion criteria. Final agreement on study inclu-
sion was made by discussion and consensus with other 
authors. Two reviewers performed all data extraction 
including evaluation of study characteristics, risk of 
bias, and outcome measures. Key variables were 
selected based on clinical and methodological rele-
vance. Two authors pilot tested the data abstraction 
form to ensure completeness. Discrepancies were 
resolved through consensus (with PSS and RKN). Study 
authors were contacted when suitable data were not 
available.
assessment of risk of bias 
We used the Newcastle-Ottawa scale to assess risk of bias. 
This scale assesses risk in three domains:26  selection of

the study groups, comparability of groups, and ascertain-
ment of exposure and outcome.27 Studies that scored >7 
were considered as having low risk of bias, scores of 5-7 
indicated moderate risk of bias, and scores of <5 indicated 
high risk of bias.
statistical analysis
Meta-analysis was performed with Review Manager 
5.3 (Nordic Cochrane Centre, Cochrane Collaboration, 
2014) software. We assessed the adjusted hazard ratio 
and unadjusted odds ratio of developing a secondary 
malignancy between participants treated with radio-
therapy and controls. We first analyzed studies 
including any form of radiotherapy, stratified by stud-
ies that used controls groups comprising patients who 
did not undergo radiotherapy and patients treated 
with surgery.
Because of the clinical heterogeneity inherent in our 
data, we used random effects models for all meta-anal-
yses. Given the relatively rare nature of our events, we 
used Mantel-Haenszel weighting.28 For adjusted hazard 
ratios, we used the inverse variance technique. Statisti-
cal heterogeneity was assessed with I2 values.29
As a post hoc analysis, we assessed the absolute risk 
difference between patients treated with radiotherapy 
and controls. We expressed this as the difference per 
100 patients.
subgroup analysis and exploration of heterogeneity
We performed a priori subgroup analyses by examining 
studies that used only external beam radiotherapy and 
those that used only brachytherapy. For each of these 
analyses, we stratified by control group (no radiation 
and surgery). To further explore heterogeneity, we con-
ducted meta-regression using the Newcastle-Ottawa 
risk of bias score as a continuous variable in random 
effects models for all comparisons comprising five or 
more studies.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
the design and implementation of the study. There are 
no plans to involve patients in the dissemination of 
results.
Results
We retrieved 3056 references from our literature 
search (fig 1 ). After full text review of 49 manuscripts, 
we selected 21 reports for inclusion (table 1 ). Twenty 
eight studies were excluded; figure 1 lists the reasons. 
Of note, we identified 24 reports derived from the 
United States Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End 
Results (SEER) cohort in our literature search. These 
studies overlapped in their inclusion criteria, study 
intervals, patient selection, and outcome measures. 
To prevent the duplication of patients from the SEER 
cohort, we selected a single study to represent the 
SEER cohort for each comparison as outlined in 
appendix 1. The studies used in each of the analyses 
are outlined in appendix 3.
We obtained unpublished data from the principal 
author of one study we included.30  In a second case, we 
were unable to obtain necessary information for inclu-
sion in a subgroup analysis, but the published data 
were adequate for our primary analysis.31
study description
Table 1  shows characteristics of included studies. Eigh-
teen were large multi-institutional reports, and three 
were single centre studies.10 32 33 Conformal external 
beam radiotherapy was the most commonly assessed 
type of radiotherapy. There were insufficient data to dis-
tinguish between two dimensional, three dimensional, 
and intensity modulated radiotherapy, though most 
included studies assessed three dimensional conformal 
external beam radiotherapy. There were considerable 
differences in the definition and use of a lag period 
before outcome ascertainment (table 1 ). Length of fol-
low-up also varied significantly between included stud-
ies (table 1 ). Thirteen studies (62%) included patients 
treated with surgery as the comparator, and eight stud-
ies (38%) used “no radiation” or “no radiation and no 
surgery” control groups (table 1 ). Crude incidence of 
individual secondary cancers ranged from 0.2% to 2.3% 
for patients treated with external beam radiotherapy, 
0.1% to 2.1% for patients treated with brachytherapy, 
0.2% to 1.7% for patients treated with brachytherapy 
and external beam boost, and 0.3% to 2.3% for patients 
not exposed to radiotherapy; however, these rates var-
ied significantly between studies (table 1). Most studies 
did not specify whether the reported bladder cancers 
were superficial or invasive. For studies reporting 
adjusted hazard ratios, covariates included in the 
model varied significantly between studies though all 
included age at diagnosis (table A, appendix 4).
assessment of risk of bias
Most studies were deemed to be of moderate risk of bias 
(table B, appendix 4). Commonly identified concerns 
include a lack of explicit demonstration that the out-
come was not present at the start of the study, the 
length of follow-up, and attrition bias.
bladder cancer
On unadjusted analysis with no restriction to lag 
period, we found an increased odds of bladder cancer 
(nine studies, 555 873 participants; unadjusted odds 
ratio 1.39, 95% confidence interval 1.12 to 1.71; I2=56%; 
fig 2). The results were similar when we restricted anal-
ysis to studies with a five year lag period (three studies, 
397 416 participants; 1.30, 1.19 to 1.42; I2=0%; table 2 , 
fig 2) or a 10 year lag period (two studies, 99 362 
patients; 1.89, 1.65 to 2.16; I2=0%). After multivariable 
adjustment, we found an increased risk for bladder can-
cer in those treated with radiotherapy (four studies; 
adjusted hazard ratio 1.67
, 95% confidence interval 1.55 
to 1.80; I2=0%; fig 3). Absolute differences in risk of 
bladder cancer between patients exposed and unex-
posed to radiotherapy ranged from 0 to 0.6 cancers per 
100 patients, depending on type of radiotherapy, com-
parator group, and lag period (table C, appendix 4).

Colorectal cancer
On unadjusted analysis with no lag period, we found 
an increased odds of colorectal cancers after any 
form of radiotherapy compared with no radiation (10 
studies; 228 965 participants; unadjusted odds ratio 
1.68, 95% confidence interval 1.33 to 2.12; I2=72%; fig 
4). Again, results were similar after we restricted 
analysis to studies with a five year lag period (four 
studies, 242 878 patients; 1.94, 1.07 to 3.50, I2=86%; 
table 2 , fig 4) or a 10 year lag period (two studies, 
99 578 patients; 1.56, 1.36 to 1.80; I2=0%). Pooled mul-
tivariable adjusted hazard ratios showed an 
increased risk for colorectal cancer in those treated 
with radiotherapy (three studies; adjusted hazard 
ratio 1.79, 95% confidence interval 1.34 to 2.38; 
I2=28%; fig 3). The absolute difference in colorectal 
cancers ranged from 0.2 to 1.4 cases per 100 patients 
for those treated with radiotherapy and controls, 
 
depending on type of radiotherapy, comparator, and 
lag period (table C, appendix 4).
rectal cancer
When we restricted analysis to cases of rectal cancer 
after radiotherapy, we identified an increased odds 
associated with radiotherapy in unadjusted analysis 
without restriction to lag period (eight studies, 157 239 
participants; unadjusted odds ratio 1.62, 95% confi-
dence interval 1.26 to 2.08; I2=33%; fig 5). Restriction of 
analysis to those studies with a five year lag period 
showed no significant association (three studies, 
204 064 patients; 1.68, 0.90 to 3.15, I2=76%; table 2 , 
fig 5), while restriction to those studies with a 10 year 
lag period showed an association similar to the pri-
mary analysis (two studies, 99 578 patients; 2.20, 1.72 
to 2.81, I2=0%). Pooling of multivariable adjusted haz-
ard ratios showed an increased risk similar to our pri-
mary analysis (three studies; adjusted hazard ratio 
1.79, 95% confidence interval 1.34 to 2.38; I2=28%; 
fig 3). The absolute difference in risk between radio-
therapy exposed and unexposed patients ranged 
between −0.2 and 1.0 cases of rectal cancer per 100 
patients (table C, appendix 4).
lung cancer
Unadjusted analysis of studies without restriction to lag 
period showed no association between radiotherapy 
and lung cancer (seven studies, 188 911 participants; 
unadjusted odds ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 0.97 
to 1.76; I2=84%; fig A, appendix 5). Restriction of analy-
sis to studies with a five year lag period showed mar-
ginal significance (three studies, 241 298 participants; 
1.55, 1.00 to 2.40; I2=88%; table 2), while there was no 
association in those studies with a 10 year lag period 
(two studies, 99 478 patients; 1.58, 0.89 to 2.83, I2=76%). 
There was also no association when we pooled multi-
variable adjusted hazard ratios (two studies; adjusted

hazard ratio 1.45, 95% confidence interval 0.70 to 3.01; 
I2=86%). For lung cancers, the absolute difference 
between patients treated with radiotherapy and those 
not exposed ranged from −0.9 to 1.1 cancers per 100 
patients (table C, appendix 4).
hematologic cancers
We found an increased odds of hematologic cancers 
after radiotherapy in studies without restriction to lag 
period (six studies, 180 032 participants; unadjusted 
odds ratio 1.33, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.69; 
I2=50%; fig B, appendix 5), but this was not confirmed 
in studies with a five year lag period (two studies, 
172 232 patients; 1.30, 0.79 to 2.13; I2=57%; table 2), a 10 
year lag period (one study, 96 811 patients; 1.09, 0.94 to 
1.27), or multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (one 
study; adjusted hazard ratio 1.64, 95% confidence 
 
interval 0.90 to 2.99). The absolute difference in risk 
ranged between −0.6 and 0.2 cases per 100 patients for 
patients treated with radiotherapy and controls, 
depending on type of radiotherapy, comparator, and 
lag period (table C, appendix 4).

subgroup analysis and exploration of heterogeneity
Studies limited to external beam radiotherapy pre-
dominately reported an increased odds of secondary 
malignancy after radiotherapy, whereas those lim-
ited to brachytherapy did not show this association 
(figs C and D, appendix 5; table 2). We conducted 
meta-regression using risk of bias score as a continu-
ous variable in a random effects model when more 
than five studies were included in the meta-analyses. 
None of the analyses showed a significant effect of 
risk of bias score (all P>0.05) as a covariate on 
observed associations.
discussion
In this comprehensive review and meta-analysis of 21 
studies with moderate risk of bias, we identified an asso-
ciation between radiotherapy for prostate cancer and 
the development of secondary cancers of the bladder, 
colorectal tract, and rectum, compared with no radio-
therapy or surgery. These results were consistent when 
we pooled multivariable adjusted hazard ratios and 
restricted analyses to studies using five or 10 year lag 
periods between treatment and outcome ascertainment. 
In particular, it is notable in our analysis that odds ratios 
for bladder and rectal cancer increased with a longer lag 
time (odds ratio at five year lag v 10 year lag: 1.3 v 1.89 for 
bladder cancer and 1.68 v 2.2 for rectal cancer). It is 
important to note, however, that the differences in abso-
lute risks between cases and controls were low (table 1). 
In post hoc analyses, the absolute risk difference for 
patients treated with radiotherapy compared with those 
not treated with radiotherapy ranged from −0.9 to 1.9 
cancers per 100 patients, with differences observed 
based on type of radiotherapy, comparator group, and 
lag time duration indicating that absolute risk for these 
secondary cancers is low.
Given the current understanding that the risk of sec-
ondary malignancy related to radiation increases over 
time, the progressive increase in odds ratio over time 
seen in our study supports a potential association 
between radiotherapy and the development of a sec-
ondary malignancy of the bladder and rectum. We did 
not find an association between radiotherapy and lung 
or hematologic cancers. It must be noted that many of 
the results were obtained from a small number of stud-
ies (between two and 10 in each analyses), and the 
absolute risk of secondary malignancy remains low. 
Variation in the crude incidence of secondary cancers 
is, at least in part, due to differences in follow-up 
between the included studies.
There was a trend across all analyses for lower odds 
ratios or hazard ratios in the pooled analysis resulting 
from studies using surgically treated patients as the 
control group rather than those using patients unex-
posed to radiotherapy. This could reflect a selection 
bias, with lower outcome ascertainment in those 
patients not treated with a definitive local therapy. 
 
Similarly, as patients treated with radiotherapy might 
experience increased bowel urgency and other rec-
to-anal symptoms, including bleeding, as a result of

their treatment,3 there is a potential for detection bias 
for colorectal and rectal cancers.
There was significant heterogeneity between studies 
for many of our outcomes, likely in large part because of 
the differences in control groups used and specific 
types of radiation delivered. Some studies used a sur-
gery group6 
10 
31 
37 
38  while others used a “no radiation” 
group7 30 42 44  and yet others used a “no radiation, no 
surgery” group.34  We sought to diminish the influence 
of these differences by providing stratified subgroup 
analyses. Further, within the external beam radiother-
apy category, there was heterogeneity in radiotherapy 
techniques used (two dimensional6 
47  and three dimen-
sional6  conformational radiotherapy, external beam 
radiotherapy without further specification,7

and intensity modulated radiotherapy10). Differences in 
the length of follow-up could contribute further to the 
heterogeneity. We also explored the role of study risk of 
bias in the observed heterogeneity. Meta-regression, 
however, failed to show a significant effect of risk of 
bias on the observed estimates.
Comparison with other studies
To our knowledge, there is only one other meta-analysis 
on this subject in addition to non-systematic reviews of 
the literature.11 
12 
13 
14 
15  Our review differs from the previ-
ous meta-analysis15  on this topic, which included only 
four studies. We identified significantly more studies 
and even among them we had to select studies from 
SEER cohort. In addition, most of their analyses relied 
on a single publication.40 Further, they did not assess 
different radiotherapy techniques separately. Ours is 
the first attempt to quantify available knowledge on the 
subject in the most comprehensive, reproducible, and 
methodologically appropriate fashion.
Secondary primary cancers can arise because of com-
mon etiologic factors, including genetic predisposi-
tions, or effects related to treatment. Further, there 
might be issues of diagnostic bias when comparisons 
are made between treated patients and the general pop-
ulation. Considering that the comparison between 
patients treated with radiotherapy and those treated 
with surgery showed similar results to the main analy-
sis, however, our data suggest that secondary cancers 
are largely because of effects related to treatment.
Several studies have shown differences in the risk of 
secondary cancer by specific type of radiation treat-
ment. In our analysis, the association between radio-
therapy and secondary cancers was much weaker for 
patients treated with brachytherapy than for those 
treated with external beam radiotherapy, in keeping 
with others’ work.48  Notably, when we assessed crude 
absolute incidence rates, patients treated with 
brachytherapy not infrequently had rates of secondary 
cancer lower than the control group; this likely rep-
resents selection of younger and healthier patients for 
brachytherapy. In a study of a single centre case series 
compared with the SEER population registry, Huang 
and colleagues showed no difference in rates of second-
ary malignancies between those men treated with 
brachytherapy and radical prostatectomy.32  Moon and 
colleagues found that treatment with brachytherapy 
was associated with an increased odds of bladder can-
cer compared with treatment with surgery but that this 
risk did not apply to other tumor sites.42  It can be spec-
ulated that brachytherapy could pose a lower risk of 
secondary malignancy related to radiation than exter-
nal beam radiotherapy because it delivers much less 
integral radiation to normal tissues (outside the pros-
tate) than external beam radiotherapy. While we did not 
examine intensity modulated radiotherapy separately 
from other types of external beam radiotherapy, it has 
supplanted conformal external beam radiotherapy in 
many jurisdictions.49  To date, only a single study, by 
Zelefsky and colleagues, has independently examined 
the effect of intensity modulated radiotherapy on sec-
ondary cancers, and they reported no increased risk.10
strengths and limitations of study
Major strengths of our review include the comprehen-
sive search, careful selection of studies, critical 
appraisal of studies, planned subgroup analyses, anal-
yses accounting for time lag in different methods 
(dichotomous and time incorporated hazards), and 
inclusion of adjusted estimates for hazard ratio. We 
must, however, acknowledge the limitations. First, 
given the number of studies derived from the SEER reg-
istry, we had to select a representative study. We used 
an explicit and transparent method. To ascertain 
whether study selection affected the results, however, 
we undertook a sensitivity analysis using the Newcas-
tle-Ottawa risk of bias score as the primary determinant 
and sample size as the second. This resulted in the 
selection of a different study in 24 out of 83 comparisons 
(28.9%; appendix 6). For these 24 comparisons, the 
change in selected study resulted in an average change 
of −3.5% in the odds ratio estimates. As a result, the use 
of different selection criteria resulted in an average 
change of −1.02% when we considered all 83 compari-
sons. Therefore, we consider the study selection was 
robust. Second, we lacked important information on 
confounders and comorbidities and other risk factors 
associated with cancers other than prostate cancer, 
which might be higher in patients who are treated with 
radiotherapy. Of particular note is the lack of informa-
tion on smoking for the ascertainment of risk of lung 
and bladder cancer, and obesity, which could predis-
pose patients to colon50  and prostate cancer.51 This 
might bias the increased risk attributed to radiotherapy. 
Third, the small numbers of studies in individual sub-
group analyses limited power in our conclusions. 
Finally, included studies had moderate risk of bias, and 
there is an ongoing need for high quality and minimally 
biased studies.
Conclusions and implications for practice and 
research
In view of the limited number of studies and limited 
adjustment for confounders, we identify an important 
need for future studies assessing the risk of secondary 
malignancy after radiotherapy for prostate cancer. This 
can be undertaken either as large prospective cohort

studies or multinational prospective registries. Implica-
tions of our results for clinical practice include use of 
these results in discussion with patients for decision 
making. In particular, for patients with a long life 
expectancy of 20 years or more, the possibility of sec-
ondary malignancy related to radiation needs to be 
included in management discussion. We acknowledge, 
however, that further studies are required before con-
clusive implication of the association between radio-
therapy and secondary malignancy in these patients.
In conclusion, we identified a possible association 
between radiotherapy and an increased odds of second-
ary cancers compared with no radiotherapy or with sur-
gery. We identified consistent evidence of an increased 
risk of bladder, colorectal, and rectal cancers in men 
treated with radiotherapy. We did not find consistent evi-
dence for an association between radiotherapy and sec-
ondary lung and hematologic cancers. Although there 
was an increase in risk, the absolute rates of these sec-
ondary cancers remain low, particularly compared with 
other rates of complications associated with treatment 
for prostate cancer. This information could be helpful in 
the decision making process regarding such treatment.
