Abstract
Purpose To investigate the efficacy and safety of doublet versus single-agent chemotherapy (CT) plus trastuzumab (H) as 
first-line therapy for human epidermal growth factor 2 receptor (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC).
Methods We searched for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that evaluated the treatment effects of single-agent or doublet 
CT+H as first-line therapies for HER2-positive MBC. The main outcomes measured for this study included the overall 
response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). A meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis 
(TSA) were performed, and the study quality was evaluated using the GRADE framework. The PROSPERO registry number 
of our analysis is CRD42016043766.
Results The results from four RCTs including 1044 participants were pooled. Moderate-quality evidence indicated that 
compared with single-agent CT+H, doublet CT+H correlated better with prolonged PFS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.69, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] 0.63–0.75, P < 0.0001) and OS (HR = 0.90, 95% CI 0.88–0.92, P < 0.0001). However, moderate-
quality evidence revealed no significant difference between the two regimens regarding the ORR (relative risk [RR] = 1.07, 
95% CI 0.98–1.17, P = 0.157), which was confirmed by TSA, indicating that the cumulative Z-curve entered the futility 
area. Moderate-quality evidence indicated that treatment-related grade 3 or 4 toxicities of thrombocytopenia (RR = 4.08, 
P = 0.000), nausea/vomiting (RR = 4.26, P = 0.002), diarrhea (RR = 2.81, P = 0.002), and stomatitis (RR = 5.02, P = 0.003) 
were observed more frequently with doublet CT+H than with single-agent CT+H.
Conclusions Compared with single-agent CT, the combination of doublet CT with trastuzumab as first-line therapy for 
HER2-positive MBC is associated with longer PFS and OS, but more treatment-related grade 3 or 4 toxicities. Therefore, 
doublet CT appears to be an appropriate regimen for HER2-positive MBC with a good performance status.

metastasis [1, 2]. HER2 protein overexpression or gene 
amplification occurs in approximately 20–25% of patients 
with metastatic breast cancer (MBC), and is characterized 
by aggressive tumor growth, a high possibility of recurrence, 
and decreased survival. Fortunately, the introduction of anti-
HER2 therapy has alleviated many of these concerns [3, 4].
Blocking HER2 using antibodies with a high affinity to 
the extracellular domain of the receptor leads to antibody-
dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and prevents 
the intracellular kinase domain of the receptor from engag-
ing in signal transduction. This blockade results in inhibition 
of numerous mitogenic pathways in HER2-overexpressing 
malignant tumor cells [5, 6]. Trastuzumab (Herceptin [H], 
F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland) is a recom-
binant, humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits HER2 
signaling, and has been approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) for treatment of HER2-positive MBC 
[7, 8]. Previous clinical studies have extensively evaluated 
the use of trastuzumab in MBC, and the results have demon-
strated that it significantly increases the survival of patients 
with HER2-positive MBC. Additionally, a number of studies 
have shown that trastuzumab inhibits tumor growth, pro-
duces a high response rate, and improves patient prognosis 
when used in combination with chemotherapy (CT) [9, 10]. 
Trastuzumab exerts greater activity when used in combina-
tion due to enhancement in the blockade of HER2 signaling; 
thus, the combination of trastuzumab with standard taxane- 
and platinum-based CT is recommended. These combination 
therapies provide significant survival benefits to women with 
HER2-positive MBC [10–12].
The current National Comprehensive Cancer Network 
(NCCN) guidelines recommend trastuzumab combined 
with CT as first-line therapy for patients with HER2-pos-
itive MBC; however, whether doublet-agent CT is supe-
rior to single-agent CT when combined with trastuzumab 
remains unknown [13]. Moreover, other relevant guidelines 
regarding these treatment regimens are lacking. In a ran-
domized phase III trial [14] that examined patients with 
HER2-positive MBC, the addition of carboplatin to pacli-
taxel and trastuzumab was associated with a higher overall 
response rate (ORR) and increased overall survival (OS) 
compared with those obtained with paclitaxel combined 
with trastuzumab. In contrast, the BCIRG 007 study [15] 
indicated that in women with HER2-positive MBC, the 
addition of carboplatin to docetaxel and trastuzumab did 
not significantly affect the ORR or OS compared with those 
obtained with docetaxel plus trastuzumab. To resolve such 
inconsistencies, a comprehensive, high-quality assessment 
of the most recent randomized clinical trials (RCTs) exam-
ining treatment strategies for patients with HER2-positive 
MBC is warranted. Thus, the current meta-analysis sought to 
assess the currently available evidence regarding the effec-
tiveness of single-agent versus doublet CT when combined 
with trastuzumab-targeted therapy as first-line therapy for 
women with HER2-positive MBC.
Methods
This study was registered with PROSPERO (registration 
number CRD42016043766). The recommendations in the 
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions 
and the guidelines in the PRISMA statement were utilized 
to design, analyze, and report this meta-analysis [16, 17].
Database search and trial selection
A systematic literature search of the PubMed, EMBASE, and 
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases 
was performed to identify relevant RCTs published prior 
to July 2016. The population, intervention, comparison, and 
outcome (PICO) strategy was used with the following search 
terms: “trastuzumab,” “metastatic breast cancer,” “HER2 
positive,” and “randomized clinical trial.” No restrictions 
were imposed regarding sample size, population, language, 
publication year, publication type, or publication status. The 
following criteria were applied: RCTs that compared the effi-
cacy of H combined with “standard CT” (single-agent or 
doublet) for patients with HER2-positive MBC and original 
full-text articles that reported one or more of the following 
outcomes: ORR, disease control rate (DCR), progression-
free survival (PFS), OS, and safety.
Data extraction
The following baseline characteristics and outcomes were 
extracted: trial name (including first author, year of publica-
tion, and registry numbers for clinical trials), study design, 
treatment regimen, recruitment period, number of partici-
pants, participant and tumor characteristics, follow-up dura-
tion, median response duration, median OS, median PFS, 
and primary and secondary endpoints.
Statistical analyses
All efficacy endpoints were subjected to intent-to-treat 
(ITT) analysis when possible. Dichotomous data were ana-
lyzed according to the relative risk (RR) and risk difference 
(RD), with the number of patients needed to treat to benefit 
(NNTB) and the number of patients needed to treat to harm 
(NNTH) represented by 1/RD. The DerSimonian and Laird 
random effects model [18] was utilized when I2 > 50%; 
otherwise, the Mantel–Haenszel fixed effects model [19] 
was applied. For time-to-event data, estimated hazard ratios 
(HRs) were pooled using the inverse-variance method [20]. 
The median survival was summarized as the median ratio

(MR). The 95% confidence interval (CI) was reported for all 
estimates. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. 
Potential publication bias was visually evaluated using fun-
nel plots and the Copas selection model [21] and quantified 
using Begg’s [22] and Egger’s [23] unweighted regression 
tests. P < 0.05 indicated a publication bias. All P values 
were two-sided. Meta-analysis and trial sequential analy-
sis (TSA) were conducted (Supplementary trial sequential 
analysis, available online). The evidence quality was evalu-
ated using the GRADE framework (Supplementary evidence 
quality, available online). To ensure the reliability and accu-
racy of the results, two authors independently uploaded the 
data. Statistical analyses were performed using R version 
3.3.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, 
Austria).
Results
Search strategy, results, and study characteristics
Altogether, 4575 potential studies were identified using 
the search criteria. We qualitatively examined each article, 
which resulted in the selection of four RCTs [14, 15, 24, 
25] for inclusion in our meta-analysis (Supplementary Fig. 
S1, available online). The included trials and patient char-
acteristics are presented in Table 1. The four RCTs [14, 15, 
24, 25] were published between 2006 and 2014 by Robert 
et al. [14], Wardley et al. (NCT01038466) [24], Valero et al. 
(NCT00047255) [15], and Baselga et al. (NCT00294996) 
[25]. In total, 1044 participants were included (median 
age [range] 52 years [18–83]), with 196–363 participants 
included per study. Three of the four eligible studies were 
multicenter and/or international randomized trials that 
recruited participants from 1998 to 2009. Of the included 
trials, two trials [14, 15] examined the combination of H, 
taxanes (paclitaxel/docetaxel) and carboplatin; one trial [24] 
examined the combination of H, a taxane (docetaxel) and 
capecitabine; and one trial [25] examined the combination 
of a taxane (paclitaxel), an anthracycline (non-pegylated 
liposomal doxorubicin) and H (Supplementary Table S1, 
available online). The baseline patient and tumor char-
acteristics, including patient performance status, disease 
involvement, clinicopathological tumor features, and prior 
therapy regimens, showed similar distributions between the 
study groups. The data revealed that nearly all (99%) of the 
patients had a pretreatment performance status of at least 
80% or less than 2, based on the Karnofsky performance 
score (KPS) or the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
performance status (ECOG-PS) score, respectively. All trials 
were determined to have an unclear or high risk of bias due 
to insufficient participants and the lack of personnel blinding 
(Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3, available online).
Efficacy
ORR did not significantly differ between the groups
Four trials comprising 1034 total participants were included 
in the current meta-analysis to estimate the ORR. The pooled 
ORRs were 66 and 61% for doublet CT+H and single-agent 
CT+H, respectively. These results provided moderate-qual-
ity evidence indicating that no significant difference existed 
between the two groups in terms of the ORR (RR = 1.07, 
95% CI 0.98–1.17, P = 0.157, I2 = 41.3%; RD = 4%, 95% 
CI − 2 to 10%; Fig. 1a, Table 2). The results of Egger’s test 
(P = 0.955), Begg’s test (P = 1.000), and the Copas selec-
tion model indicated that there was no evidence of publica-
tion bias (Supplementary Fig. S4A, available online). We 
also subjected the ORR results to TSA, which provided suf-
ficient and conclusive evidence indicating that no significant 
difference existed between the groups, and thus, further tri-
als were not required (Fig. 2a).
The median response duration was reported in four tri-
als (1034 participants). The median response of the doublet 
CT+H group ranged from 10.7 to 18.1 months, whereas the 
median response of the single-agent CT+H group ranged 
from 9.4 to 15.3 months. The pooled results provided mod-
erate-quality evidence indicating that the median response 
duration was significantly longer in the doublet CT+H group 
than in the single-agent CT+H group (MR = 1.17, 95% CI 
1.10–1.25, P < 0.0001, I2 = 0.0%; Table 2; Supplementary 
Fig. S5A, available online).
The DCR was not significantly different between the groups
DCR data were available for three RCTs [14, 15, 24] (671 
participants). The pooled DCRs for the doublet CT+H and 
single-agent CT+H groups were 92 and 87%, respectively. 
The pooled results provided low-quality evidence indicating 
that no significant difference in the DCR existed between 
the groups (RR = 1.05, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.15, P = 0.282, 
I2 = 65.8%; RD = 5%, 95% CI − 4 to 13%; Fig. 1b, Table 2). 
No significant publication bias was identified based on the 
results of Egger’s test (P = 0.541), Begg’s test (P = 1.000), 
and the Copas selection model (Supplementary Fig. S4B, 
available online). We also subjected the DCR results to TSA, 
which indicated that additional trials were not required and 
were unlikely to alter the outcomes (Fig. 2b).
Doublet CT+H was associated with longer PFS
We performed a pooled analysis of the three trials [14, 
24, 25] (771 participants) that reported sufficient PFS 
data. The median PFS values for the doublet CT+H and 
single-agent CT+H groups ranged from 10.7 to 17.9 and 
from 7.1 to 14.5 months, respectively. The trials provided

group had a significantly longer PFS than did the sin-
gle-agent CT+H group (MR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.09–1.60, 
P = 0.004, I2 = 85.7%; Supplementary Fig. S5B, available

moderate-quality evidence that doublet CT+H is asso-
ciated with a 31% reduction in disease-progression risk 
compared with the disease-progression risk with single-
agent CT+H (HR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.63–0.75, P < 0.0001,

tion model (Supplementary Fig. S4C, available online) 
indicated that there was no evidence of publication bias 
regarding PFS.
Doublet CT+H was associated with longer OS
All four trials (1034 participants) reported comparable 
median OS values for the doublet CT+H and single-agent 
CT+H groups, ranging from 33.6 to 46.0 months and from 
29.0 to 40.2 months, respectively. The pooled results pro-
vided moderate-quality evidence indicating that the dou-
blet CT+H group had a significantly longer OS than the 
single-agent CT+H group (MR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.04–1.18, 
P = 0.001, I2 = 9.1%; Supplementary Fig. S5C, available

ity evidence showing that in women with HER2-positive 
MBC, doublet CT+H is associated with a 10% reduction 
in the risk of death compared with that with single-agent

CT+H (HR = 0.90, 95% CI 0.88–0.92, P < 0.0001, I2 = 0%; 
Fig. 1D, Table 2). The results of Egger’s test (P = 0.814), 
Begg’s test (P = 1.000), and the Copas selection model 
(Supplementary Fig. S4D, available online) indicated that 
there was no evidence of publication bias regarding OS.
Safety
For non-hematologic toxicities, the meta-analysis provided 
moderate-quality evidence showing that compared with 
single-agent CT+H, doublet CT+H significantly increased 
the risk of nausea/vomiting (RR = 4.26, P = 0.002; 
NNTH = 25), diarrhea (RR = 2.81, P = 0.002; NNTH = 25), 
and stomatitis (RR = 5.02, P = 0.003; NNTH = 25). For 
hematologic toxicities, the meta-analysis provided moder-
ate-quality evidence indicating that doublet CT+H signifi-
cantly increased the risk of thrombocytopenia (RR = 4.08, 
P = 0.000; NNTH = 20). We also examined whether the 
potential benefit of doublet CT+H was offset by its higher 
toxicity rate by comparing the benefits (HR) with the risks of 
grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, stomatitis, nausea/vomiting, 
and diarrhea (as percentages) between the doublet CT+H 
and single-agent CT+H groups (Fig. 3). There was only a 
slight association between the risk rates for these grade 3 or 
4 toxicities and the doublet CT+H intervention. The safety 
results are summarized in Table S2 in the Supplemental 
Materials section (available online).
Study withdrawals
Three trials [14, 24, 25] (781 participants) reported that 89 
patients discontinued therapy as a result of treatment-related 
toxicities. The pooled RR provided very low-quality evi-
dence that revealed no significant difference in the number 
of patients who discontinued therapy between the doublet 
CT+H and single-agent CT+H groups (10% vs. 8%, respec-
tively; RR = 1.15, 95% CI 0.50–2.65, P = 0.747, I2 = 53.9%; 
RD = 2%, 95% CI − 5 to 8%; Supplementary Table S2 
and Supplementary Fig. S6A, available online). No pub-
lication bias was identified from the results of Egger’s test 
(P = 0.872), Begg’s test (P = 1.000), or the Copas selection 
model (Supplementary Fig. S4E, available online).

Three trials [15, 24, 25] (848 participants) reported 27 
deaths during the drug therapy period. The pooled incidence 
of mortality (3%) was the same for both treatment arms. The 
pooled RR provided very low-quality evidence showing the 
absence of a significant difference in mortality between the 
doublet CT+H and single-agent CT+H groups (RR = 0.80, 
95% CI 0.38–1.68, P = 0.557, I2 = 0.0%; RD = − 1%, 95% 
CI − 3 to 2%; Supplementary Table S2 and Supplementary 
Fig. S6B, available online). No publication bias was identi-
fied from the results of Egger’s test (P = 0.993), Begg’s test 
(P = 1.000), or the Copas selection model (Supplementary 
Fig. S6F, available online).
Discussion
Principal findings
To the best of our knowledge, this study constitutes the first 
meta-analysis to comprehensively and systematically eval-
uate the efficacy and safety of single-agent CT+H versus 
doublet CT+H as first-line therapy for patients with HER2-
positive MBC. Our investigation describes the effects of 
the duration and efficacy of these treatments on survival. 
Overall, 1044 patients were included, and no significant 
differences in the ORR (66% vs. 61%, P = 0.157) or DCR 
(92% vs. 87%, P = 0.282) were found between the groups. 
PFS (P < 0.0001) and OS (P < 0.0001) were significantly 
longer in the doublet CT+H group than in the single-agent 
CT+H group, and the results showed a clinically meaningful 
difference in median survival. The results of safety analy-
ses showed that both groups tolerated the drug regimens 
well. Fewer grade 3 or 4 adverse events were associated with 
single-agent CT+H than with doublet CT+H.
Implications for clinical practice
The current NCCN guidelines recommend pertuzumab plus 
trastuzumab in combination with a taxane as the preferred 
first-line therapy for HER2-positive MBC [13, 26]. How-
ever, pertuzumab has not yet been approved as a treatment 
for patients with HER2-positive MBC in several countries, 
including China. Therefore, first-line trastuzumab in combi-
nation with a selected CT regimen (e.g., paclitaxel ± carbo-
platin, docetaxel, vinorelbine, and capecitabine) is another 
therapeutic option for HER2-positive MBC [13]. However, 
whether doublet CT is superior to single-agent CT in com-
bination with trastuzumab for such patients has not been 
clarified. The results of a prior literature-based meta-analysis 
suggested that combination CT results in a better ORR than 
a sequential single-agent CT in patients with HER2-negative 
MBC. However, no difference in OS or PFS was found when 
these treatment strategies were compared in HER2-positive 
MBC [27]. These findings support international guidelines 
that recommend the use of sequential monotherapy for 
most cases of MBC, unless rapid disease progression, or 
life-threatening visceral metastases occurs, or the need for 
rapid symptom or disease control is present, in which case 
combination CT is preferred [28]. Nonetheless, whether 
the most effective chemotherapy regimen should consist of 
single or doublet chemotherapeutic agents combined with 
trastuzumab for HER2-positive disease remains unclear.
In the present meta-analysis, although no statistically 
significant difference in the ORR was found between the 
groups, doublet CT+H resulted in a significantly longer 
median response duration than single-agent CT+H 
(MR = 1.17, P < 0.0001). The PFS and OS were also sig-
nificantly longer in the doublet CT+H group than in the 
single-agent CT+H group. Altogether, these findings indi-
cate that greater inconsistency and fewer direct correlations 
may exist between the response rate and survival benefits.
One explanation for the differences in PFS and OS but 
not the ORR between the study arms is that doublet CT+H 
resulted in a prolonged median response duration, which 
might also underlie the inconsistencies noted between the 
short-term response and long-term survival benefits. This 
phenomenon was also observed in other trials. For instance, 
in the FIRE-3 trial, no significant difference was identified in 
the ORR of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer when 
either cetuximab or bevacizumab was added to fluorouracil 
with folinic acid and irinotecan (FOLFIRI). However, cetux-
imab was associated with a longer OS, which suggests that 
FOLFIRI plus cetuximab should be the preferred first-line 
regimen for these patients [29]. The inconsistencies noted 
in the abovementioned study might be due to the deepness 
of response (DpR) to therapy, as the DpR might not have 
been adequately captured using RECIST guidelines when 
comparing the different targeted therapies.
Another reason that a significant difference in long-
term survival benefit was observed but no apparent dif-
ference in the short-term response was found between the 
groups could be the immunologic effect of the treatment. 
The mechanisms of action of trastuzumab include the direct 
arrest of cell growth, the induction of apoptosis, the inhi-
bition of HER2 shedding, and the recruitment of immune 
effector cells that mediate tumor cell lysis. The recruitment 
of immune effector cells and subsequent cell lysis, desig-
nated ADCC, depends on the expression of Fc receptors 
(FcRs) in innate immune cells [30]. A recent study con-
ducted using FinHER adjuvant samples [31] was the first 
to demonstrate an association between high numbers of 
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and an increased benefit of 
trastuzumab in HER2+ MBC. Thus, although trastuzumab is 
thought to act primarily on tumor cells, antitumor immunity 
might also underlie the efficacy of anti-HER2 treatment.

Recent data have indicated that both nivolumab and pem-
brolizumab significantly improved OS but not PFS [32–35], 
which suggests that a divide exists between response-based 
endpoints and survival in some settings, even for pro-
grammed death 1 (PD-1) inhibitors. Immunotherapeutic 
agents produce antitumor effects by inducing cancer-specific 
immune responses or modifying native immune processes. 
The resulting clinical response patterns extend beyond those 
of cytotoxic agents and can manifest after an initial increase 
in the tumor burden or the appearance of new lesions (i.e., 
disease progression).
Therefore, RECIST or WHO criteria, which are designed 
to detect early effects of cytotoxic agents, might not provide 
a complete assessment of immunotherapeutic agents. The 
modification of these criteria to capture the unique response 
patterns generated by immunotherapeutic agents has previ-
ously been proposed and is becoming increasingly recog-
nized as necessary for the proper evaluation of these agents 
[36]. In a case study of an ipilimumab-treated patient who 
exhibited disease progression at a 12-week tumor assess-
ment, histologic analyses indicated that the increase in lesion 
size likely resulted from T cell infiltration as opposed to 
tumor cell proliferation [37]. Thus, inflammation in base-
line lesions might be misinterpreted as disease progression 
(a version of the “tumor flare reaction”). Therefore, for 
immunotherapeutic agents that induce tumor shrinkage in 
some patients, the evaluation of immune-related criteria will 
likely provide a more comprehensive assessment of clinical 
activity and might help explain why patients with apparent 
progressive disease experience better long-term survival in 
some cases.
Improving survival of patients with metastatic disease is 
a worthy goal, even if objective responses are not improved. 
Furthermore, evaluating the statistical and clinical signifi-
cance of intervention outcomes [38] by assessing the mag-
nitudes of effect sizes, patient-reported minimum relevant 
differences and self-perceived meaningful benefits [39], 
provides considerable insight into treatment-related toxic-
ity, including grade 3 or 4 hematologic and non-hematologic 
toxicities, reasons for therapy discontinuation, and mortality 
during therapy. Moreover, patient performance status should 
be equally considered when reporting prognostic factors and 
associated outcomes. Previous studies have demonstrated 
that patients with a good pre-CT performance status may 
have a clinically significantly longer OS than expected [24]. 
The results of our toxicity analysis indicated that nearly all 
(99%) of the patients had a pretreatment performance sta-
tus of at least 80% or less than 2, based on the KPS or the 
ECOG-PS score, respectively, and that treatment-related 
grade 3 or 4 hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities 
occurred more frequently with doublet CT+H than with 
single-agent CT+H. However, no significant differences in 
mortality or discontinued therapy due to treatment-related 
toxicities were found between the groups. Given that CT 
is a frontline therapy for HER2-positive MBC in a variety 
of clinical settings, determining the pretreatment perfor-
mance status of a patient is essential. Overall, we believe 
that treatment regimens should be selected in the context of 
effectiveness, performance status, comorbidities, and toxic-
ity profiles. Our findings support the use of doublet CT+H 
as first-line therapy for patients with HER2-positive disease 
unless a patient exhibits a poor pretreatment performance 
status, in which case single-agent CT+H will be recom-
mended. Several factors limited our confidence in the effect 
estimates and CIs in our meta-analysis (Supplementary limi-
tations, available online).
Conclusion
In conclusion, the results of this meta-analysis indicate that 
compared with single-agent CT+H, doublet CT+H results 
in prolonged PFS and OS but more treatment-related tox-
icities when used as first-line therapy for patients with 
HER2-positive MBC. Moreover, compared with patients 
who received single-agent CT+H, those who received dou-
blet CT+H showed a non-significant trend toward improved 
ORR. Based on our findings, we recommend doublet CT+H 
as first-line therapy for patients with good pretreatment per-
formance status; however, in the case of patients with poor 
performance status, single-agent CT+H is recommended, 
regardless of the desire to rapidly reduce the tumor burden.
