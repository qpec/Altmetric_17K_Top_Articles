Abstract
Although individuals age and die with time, an animal species can continue indefinitely, because 
of its immortal germ-cell lineage1. How the germline avoids transmitting damage from one 
generation to the next remains a fundamental question in biology. Here we identify a lysosomal 
switch that enhances germline proteostasis before fertilization. We find that Caenorhabditis 
elegans oocytes whose maturation is arrested by the absence of sperm2 exhibit hallmarks of 
proteostasis collapse, including protein aggregation. Remarkably, sperm-secreted hormones re-
establish oocyte proteostasis once fertilization becomes imminent. Key to this restoration is 
activation of the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), a proton pump that acidifies lysosomes3. Sperm 
stimulate V-ATPase activity in oocytes by signalling the degradation of GLD-1, a translational 
repressor4 that blocks V-ATPase synthesis. Activated lysosomes, in turn, promote a metabolic shift 
that mobilizes protein aggregates for degradation, and reset proteostasis by enveloping and 
clearing the aggregates. Lysosome acidification also occurs during Xenopus oocyte maturation; 
thus, a lysosomal switch that enhances oocyte proteostasis in anticipation of fertilization may be 
conserved in other species.
Studies in C. elegans have suggested that damage-clearance mechanisms in the germline 
may prevent parental damage from being transmitted to progeny5. In the C. elegans 
hermaphrodite, germ cells form a developmental gradient, with mature oocytes located 
proximally, near the sperm (Fig. 1a). Protein carbonylation, a form of oxidative damage, is 
high in immature distal germ cells, but decreases in sperm-proximal oocytes5. This decrease 
is likely to be signalled by sperm-derived ‘major sperm proteins’ (MSPs), which trigger 
meiotic maturation in nearby oocytes2,6 (Fig. 1a), because ‘female’ mutants, which lack 
sperm, do not eliminate the protein carbonyls5. While these observations hint that sperm 
signals may prompt damage removal, the nature and scope of any quality-control programs 
are unclear.

 Because protein carbonylation can be observed only in fixed animals5, we sought to identify 
markers that could be used to track damage clearance in real time. In C. elegans, many 
proteins become insoluble with age7 (Fig. 1b). We found that GFP-tagged aggregation-prone 
proteins7 formed stationary, FRAP (fluorescence recovery after photobleaching)-immobile 
aggregates in the oocytes of sperm-deficient, young-adult females (Fig. 1b–f; Extended Data 
Figs 1a–c, 2a–c). These aggregates were restricted to proximal oocytes and did not occupy 
distal regions (Extended Data Fig. 1a–c), similar to those seen in aged hermaphrodites7. We 
also detected endogenous protein aggregates in the oocytes of females, using the protein-
aggregate detection reagent Proteostat (Fig. 1g, h). Notably, when sperm were introduced 
through mating, the protein aggregates became dynamic and were eliminated within an hour 
(Fig. 1i; Extended Data Fig. 2d–i).
Protein aggregates were cleared before oocytes were fertilized (Extended Data Fig. 2d–f), 
suggesting that sperm signalling, and not fertilization, influences protein aggregation in 
oocytes. Indeed, animals that produce infertile sperm but maintain MSP signaling8,9 did not 
exhibit oocyte protein aggregation (Extended Data Fig. 2j, k). Mimicking MSP signalling in 
females by knocking down goa-1, a downstream Gαo/i-protein target of MSP signalling that 
blocks oocyte maturation10, also prevented aggregation (Fig. 1j). These data confirm that 
the sperm-dependent oocyte-maturation pathway triggers elimination of protein-aggregates 
in C. elegans.
We screened for sperm-responsive factors that were required for aggregate removal (Fig. 2a), 
focusing on genes required for fertility that have been annotated for a role in proteostasis 
and/or metabolism11. We used RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down expression of 
approximately 60 genes; one of these knockdowns produced a striking protein-aggregation 
phenotype in oocytes from hermaphrodites (Fig. 2b, c). This gene, vha-13, encodes a 
catalytic subunit of the V-ATPase, a lysosomal proton pump3 that is important for 
longevity12 (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Knockdown of other V-ATPase subunits produced 
similar protein-aggregation phenotypes (Extended Data Fig. 3b–d). Protein aggregates 
caused by V-ATPase gene knockdowns were not eliminated by mating (Extended Data Fig. 
3e), nor by the gsa-1(ce94gf) mutation in Gαs (Extended Data Fig. 3f, g), which 
constitutively activates the MSP-responsive oocyte-maturation pathway10. Thus, the 
lysosomal V-ATPase is a downstream component of the oocyte quality-control program.
The V-ATPase proton pump acidifies the lysosome3. We found that inhibiting V-ATPase 
activity using bafilomycin A1 (ref. 13) or neutralizing lysosomal acidity with a weak base14 
induced oocyte protein aggregation in hermaphrodites (Extended Data Fig. 3h, i). We 
therefore hypothesized that lysosome acidification plays a regulatory role in germline 
proteostasis. If this is true, then lysosome acidification should occur in response to sperm. 
Remarkably, hermaphrodite, but not female, germlines exhibited acidic lysosomes (Fig. 2d, 
e; Extended Data Fig. 4a) that accumulated specifically in maturing, proximal oocytes in a 
V-ATPase-dependent manner (Fig. 2d–f; Extended Data Fig. 4a).
To visualize lysosomes, we expressed a GFP-fusion protein of LMP-1, the C. elegans 
orthologue of lysosome-associated LAMP2 (ref. 15). We observed LMP-1::GFP-positive 
vesicles throughout hermaphrodite (100%, n = 21) and female (100%, n = 24) germlines

 (Fig. 2g). In contrast, GFP-tagged VHA-13 was present in proximal, but not distal, germ 
cells (100%, n = 26; Fig. 2h, i). As V-ATPase puncta developed, they co-localized with 
LMP-1::GFP-positive vesicles (Fig. 2j) and predicted hotspots of acidity (Extended Data 
Fig. 4b, c). V-ATPase puncta were absent from the oocytes of females before mating (100%, 
n = 18; Fig. 2h, i), but appeared after mating (Extended Data Fig. 4d). Thus, we conclude 
that sperm trigger V-ATPase accumulation in proximal oocytes, thereby inducing lysosome 
acidification.
It seemed possible that lysosomes might actively clear the aggregates; for example, via 
macroautophagy, a lysosome-based degradation pathway14,16. In this pathway, 
autophagosomes fuse with acidic lysosomes. We found that autophagosomes labelled with 
GFP::LGG-1 (orthologous to LC3, ref. 16) accumulated in the oocytes of females (Extended 
Data Fig. 5a, b), consistent with their lack of acidic lysosomes. However, knockdown of 
macroautophagy genes did not induce protein aggregation in hermaphrodite oocytes, nor did 
it block the mobilization and clearance of oocyte protein aggregates in mated females 
(Extended Data Fig. 5c–i). Thus, macroautophagy does not appear to clear the aggregates. 
Moreover, when we tracked protein aggregates and lysosomes in real time, we observed 
lysosomes extending arm-like projections that enveloped sperm-mobilized aggregates 
immediately before their disappearance (Fig. 2k, l; Extended Data Fig. 5j). Thus, lysosomes 
appear to engulf the aggregates directly. This process resembles microautophagy17; 
however, microautophagy genes have not been identified in C. elegans, precluding further 
analysis.
Next, we investigated the molecular control of V-ATPase accumulation. The rise in 
GFP::VHA-13 signal, starting at the bend of the hermaphrodite gonad (Figs. 2h, 3a), 
suggested that vha-13 expression might be repressed distally. GLD-1, a major translational 
repressor4, is abundant in the distal germline, where it binds the 3'-untranslated regions 
(UTRs) of many germline mRNAs18, but it is absent from proximal oocytes of 
hermaphrodites19 (Fig. 3b, c). Notably, a previous GLD-1-immunoprecipitation analysis18 
identified mRNAs encoding 10 of the 21 C. elegans V-ATPase subunits, suggesting that 
GLD-1 may define the spatial expression of the V-ATPase.
To test this hypothesis, we examined GFP::VHA-13 localization in gld-1(q485)-null 
mutants20. As would be expected if GLD-1 repressed V-ATPase translation in distal regions, 
GFP::VHA-13 fluorescence was increased in distal germ cells lacking GLD-1 (100%, n = 
15; Fig. 3d–f), and lysosomal acidity developed distally (Extended Data Fig. 6a). We 
verified that GLD-1 regulates vha-13 translation in a wild-type germline by expressing 
gfp::vha-13 with the 3' UTR of tbb-2 (encoding tubulin), which prevents GLD-1 binding21; 
again, GFP::VHA-13 expression extended distally (100%, n = 22; Fig. 3d, g).
These findings suggest that sperm signalling prompts V-ATPase expression in proximal 
oocytes by removing GLD-1. Indeed, in female worms, GLD-1 was present in proximal as 
well as distal oocytes (Fig. 3a–c), but was eliminated from proximal oocytes after mating 
(Fig. 3h). Thus, GLD-1 degradation is an initiating event for proteostasis renewal. GLD-1 
degradation was proteasome-dependent (Fig. 3c, i). The proteasome was present and active 
throughout the hermaphrodite germline (Extended Data Fig. 6b–d), implying that sperm

 signalling activates a target-specific pathway to degrade GLD-1. If the proteasome also 
degraded aggregates, then proteasome inhibition should lead to protein aggregation in gld-1-
null mutants. This did not occur (Extended Data Fig. 6e–g), consistent with our finding that 
lysosomes engulf aggregates directly.
Because oocyte maturation would seem to be metabolically demanding, we investigated 
whether mitochondrial function might contribute to enhanced proteostasis. We detected 
changes in mitochondria during oocyte maturation. In normal hermaphrodites, mitochondria 
in distal oocytes were fragmented and reactive-oxygen species (ROS)-positive, whereas 
those in proximal oocytes were tubular, with lower ROS levels (Fig. 4a–d; Extended Data 
Fig. 7a, b). Fluorescence of a GFP-tagged mitochondria localization signal (MitoLS) was 
comparable in mitochondria with the different morphologies (Extended Data Fig. 7c), 
suggesting that the decrease in ROS was not a consequence of mitochondrial depletion. The 
shift to a tubular, low-ROS state required sperm and V-ATPase activity (Fig. 4b, d; Extended 
Data Fig. 7d–i). Therefore, we concluded that lysosome activation supports sperm-
dependent changes in mitochondrial morphology and function.
We hypothesized that these mitochondrial changes reflect a metabolic shift. The use of 
DiOC6(3) and JC-1, dyes that sense mitochondrial membrane potential12 (Extended Data 
Fig. 8a, b), indicated that distal, fragmented mitochondria had a high membrane potential 
(Fig. 4e; Extended Data Fig. 8c, d). This suggests that these mitochondria might be arrested 
in a ‘primed’ but inactive state. In contrast, the membrane potential decreased in tubular 
mitochondria of sperm-proximal oocytes, provided that the V-ATPase was present (Fig. 4e, 
f; Extended Data Fig. 8c–e). Inhibition of the mitochondrial ATP synthase, which normally 
dissipates the membrane-potential gradient to drive ATP production22, blocked the sperm-
proximal reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential and the shift to a tubular 
morphology (Fig. 4f; Extended Data Fig. 9a). ATP-synthase inhibition also caused oocyte 
protein aggregation (Fig. 4g, h; Extended Data Fig. 9b, c) without compromising lysosomal 
acidity (Extended Data Fig. 9d). Thus, mitochondria play a causal role in proteostasis 
renewal, with ATP-synthase activity potentially acting downstream of lysosomes to enhance 
oocyte proteostasis.
A fluorescently-tagged ATP synthase subunit, GFP::ATP-2, was expressed throughout the 
germline (Fig. 4i), so we reasoned that parameters other than expression were likely to 
promote ATP-synthase activity in response to sperm. One possibility was that ATP-synthase 
activity was gated by ADP levels22,23. In this model, ATP-synthase activity stalls when 
ADP is limiting; as ADP levels increase, ATP-synthase activation triggers proton flow, 
reducing membrane potential22,23 (Extended Data Fig. 10a). Using PercevalHR24, a 
ratiometric ATP:ADP sensor, we found that the ATP:ADP ratio, like the mitochondrial 
membrane potential, was high in distal oocytes but lower in sperm-proximal oocytes (Fig. 
4j). Control experiments confirmed that the change in PercevalHR fluorescence depended on 
its ATP/ADP-sensing domain (Extended Data Fig. 10b).
Together, these findings predict that distal mitochondria are primed but inactive, and that 
during oocyte maturation, a rise in ADP levels unlocks the ATP synthase. Consistent with 
this model, injecting free ADP into oocytes of females was sufficient to reduce

 mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 4k, l). In principle, lysosomal V-ATPase activity 
should boost ADP levels, consistent with its localization where the ATP:ADP ratio has 
dropped (Figs 2h, 4j). We found that the V-ATPase was required not only to lower the 
mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 4e, f), but also to decrease the ATP:ADP ratio 
(Extended Data Fig. 10c). Thus, we infer that V-ATPase activity contributes to a transition 
from high to low energy charge, characteristic of activation of metabolism22.Additionally, 
the NADH:NAD+ ratio, monitored using Peredox25, was lower in sperm-proximal oocytes, 
also indicative of metabolic activation (Extended Data Fig. 10d).
When females were mated, sperm triggered dynamic movement of aggregates prior to their 
degradation (Fig. 4m; Extended Data Fig. 2d–f). This movement was blocked by ATP-
synthase knockdown (Fig. 4m), which also caused protein aggregation despite lysosome 
acidification (Extended Data Fig. 9d). Therefore, aggregate movement may depend on 
cellular metabolic state26. To test this idea, we elicited ATP-synthase activity in oocytes of 
females by injecting ADP. ADP was sufficient to mobilize aggregates in the absence of 
sperm, and this effect required ATP synthase (Fig. 4m). ADP injection did not lead to 
aggregate clearance (Fig. 4m), presumably because it did not eliminate GLD-1 (which 
blocks lysosome activation) (Extended Data Fig. 10e), nor did it alter mitochondrial 
morphology (Extended Data Fig. 10f). However, as ADP stimulates aggregate movement, 
which probably primes cells for aggregate degradation when active lysosomes are present, 
these findings suggest a plausible mechanism by which a metabolic shift could facilitate 
proteostasis renewal.
Oocyte maturation is a well-conserved process in animals6. Lysosome activation occurs 
during oocyte maturation in C. elegans (Fig. 2f), but it is not known whether this is also true 
of other species. Therefore, we investigated lysosome activation during oocyte maturation in 
Xenopus laevis. Arrested Xenopus oocytes had no detectable lysosomal acidity (100%, n = 
9; Fig. 5a). However, acidic lysosomes were seen in progesterone-stimulated Xenopus 
oocytes undergoing maturation6(100%, n = 13; Fig. 5a). Thus, lysosome acidification during 
oocyte maturation is evolutionarily conserved, and may enhance oocyte proteostasis in 
multiple species.
In summary, we have shown that signalling from sperm triggers enhancement of proteostasis 
as C. elegans oocytes prepare for fertilization by coupling lysosome activation to oocyte 
maturation (Fig. 5b). Linking the quality-control switch to oocyte maturation may be 
biologically cost-effective5. Otherwise, it would be energetically demanding for oocytes to 
continuously cleanse themselves of damage while ‘waiting’ for fertilization, especially in 
species in which oocytes remain dormant for long periods. In such animals, signals distinct 
from MSPs, but similarly important for oocyte maturation6, may stimulate proteostasis 
renewal, as suggested by the results of our Xenopusexperiment. We note that an initial 
relaxation of proteostasis may actively promote germline quality control, as driving 
damaged proteins into aggregates may facilitate their removal27. In addition, consumption 
of aggregates could potentially help to provide raw materials to developing oocytes. 
Furthermore, defective mitochondrial fragments that cannot sustain a high membrane 
potential may also be sensed and destroyed. Keeping dormant oocytes in a metabolically 
charged state may prime the system for quick activation once metabolic enzymes, such as

 the lysosomal V-ATPase, are synthesized. How active metabolism initiates aggregate 
mobilization is unknown; it could involve energy and/or metabolite production, or possibly a 
cytoplasmic phase transition26. Finally, a striking implication of our study is that C. 
elegansgerm cells, similar to yeast28, naturally reverse multiple age-related phenotypes 
across generations. It will be of particular interest to test whether a lysosomal quality-control 
switch, potentially linked to metabolic activation, can be induced in the ageing soma to 
reverse age-related phenotypes, as a molecular competence for rejuvenation appears to also 
exist in somatic cells29,30.

The pie-1 promoter was used for germline expression21 of all markers created in this study. 
Genes were expressed with their own 3' UTRs or with the germline-permissive, GLD-1-
insensitive 3' UTR of tbb-2 (ref. 21).
Ppie-1::gfp::vha-13::tbb-2 UTR and Ppie-1::gfp::vha-13::vha-13 UTR—vha-13 
was amplified by PCR from C. elegans genomic DNA and inserted into the pDONR221 
Gateway entry vector. A KpnI restriction site was inserted just upstream of the vha-13 start 
codon. A GFP-coding sequence, which had 5' and 3' KpnI overhangs but lacked a stop 
codon, was inserted into the KpnI site, and correct orientation was verified. The 531 base 
pairs immediately downstream of the vha-13 stop codon were also amplified from C. 
elegans genomic DNA. This 3' UTR of vha-13was then swapped with the tbb-2 3' UTR of 
pCM1.36 using Gibson Assembly (New England Biolabs). pDONR P4-P1R Ppie-1 
(pCM1.127), pDONR221 gfp::vha-13, and pDONR P2R-P3 containing either the tbb-23' 
UTR (pCM1.36) or the vha-13 3' UTR were combined within pCG150, a pDEST R4-R3 
Gateway destination vector, using the MultiSite Gateway Three-Fragment Vector 
Construction Kit (Life Technologies).

Ppie-1::lmp-1::gfp::lmp-1 UTR and Ppie-1::lmp-1::mcherry::lmp-1 UTR—lmp-1 
was amplified by PCR from C. elegans genomic DNA and inserted into the pDONR221 
Gateway entry vector. A KpnI restriction site was inserted in place of the lmp-1 stop codon. 
A GFP- or mCherry-coding sequence, with 5' and 3' KpnI overhangs and a stop codon, was 
inserted into the KpnI site, and correct orientation was verified. The 300 base pairs 
immediately downstream of the lmp-1 stop codon were also amplified from C. elegans 
genomic DNA and inserted into the pDONR P2R-P3 Gateway entry vector. pDONR P4-P1R 
Ppie-1, pDONR221 containing lmp-1::gfp or lmp-1::mcherry, and pDONR P2R-P3 lmp-1 3'

 Ppie-1::gfp::atp-2::atp-2 UTR—atp-2 was amplified by PCR from C. elegans genomic 
DNA and inserted into the pDONR221 Gateway entry vector. A BglII restriction site was 
inserted just upstream of the atp-2 start codon. A GFP-coding sequence, with 5' and 3' BglII 
overhangs but lacking a stop codon, was inserted into the BglII site, and correct orientation 
was verified. The 309 base pairs immediately downstream of the atp-2 stop codon were also 
PCR-amplified from C. elegans genomic DNA. This atp-2 3' UTR was inserted into the 
pDONR P2R-P3 Gateway entry vector. pDONR P4-P1R Ppie-1, pDONR221 gfp::atp-2, and 
pDONR P2R-P3 atp-2 3' UTR were combined within the pDEST R4-R3 Gateway

Ppie-1::percevalhr::tbb-2 UTR, Ppie-1::peredox::tbb-2 UTR, and 
Ppie-1::cpmvenus::tbb-2 UTR—Sequences encoding PercevalHR and Peredox were 
codon-optimized for C. elegans with the C. elegans codon adaptor tool31, with three introns 
inserted in each sequence. Gene fragments were synthesized by Integrated DNA 
Technologies, and combined into the pDONR221 Gateway entry vector using Gibson 
assembly. The cpmVenus-encoding sequence from codon-optimized PercevalHR was also 
amplified and inserted into the pDONR221 entry vector. This sequence included two introns.

DNA and inserted into the pDONR221 Gateway entry vector. A KpnI restriction site was 
inserted just upstream of the pbs-1 start codon. A GFP-coding sequence, with 5' and 3' KpnI 
overhangs but lacking a stop codon, was inserted into the KpnI site, and correct orientation 
was verified. The 214 base pairs immediately downstream of the pbs-1 stop codon were also 
amplified from C. elegans genomic DNA. This pbs-1 3' UTR was inserted into the pDONR

Ppie-1::gfp::tbb-2 UTR and Ppie-1::ub G76V ::gfp::tbb-2 UTR—gfp was amplified 
by PCR and inserted into the pDONR221 Gateway entry vector. To create a proteasome 
sensor, a gene fragment encoding the non-cleavable ubiquitin moiety UbG76V (ref. 32) was 
codon-optimized for C. elegans31, synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, and 
inserted before the gfp start codon using Gibson assembly. pDONR P4-P1R Ppie-1, 
pDONR221 containing gfp or ubG76V::gfp, and pDONR P2R-P3 tbb-2 3' UTR were

C. elegans strain generation and maintenance
Animals expressing germline markers were maintained at 25 °C to delay transgene 
silencing21. The remaining experiments were performed at 20 °C. For ageing experiments, 
adult animals were transferred to fresh plates every 2 d. Day 10 or older animals were 
designated as ‘old’, as in other studies7.

constructs (5 ng µl−1) were co-injected with PvuII-digested genomic DNA fragments from 
E. coli (100 ng µl−1) using a standard microinjection procedure34. For expression in female 
animals, fem-1(hc17) worms raised at a permissive temperature (20 °C) were injected at day 
1 of reproductive adulthood, and progeny were subsequently shifted to the restrictive 
temperature (25 °C) before imaging. For expression in a gld-1genetic-null background, 
gld-1(q485)/dpy-5(e61) unc-13(e51)heterozygotes (strain JK1466) were injected at day 1 of 
reproductive adulthood, and GFP-positive gld-1(q485)/gld-1(q485) F1 homozygotes were 
selected for imaging.
Female and self-sterile strains
The fem-1(hc17) temperature-sensitive allele35 was used to generate female adult animals 
lacking sperm. Eggs from fem-1(hc17) animals that had been raised at a permissive 
temperature (20 °C) were shifted to the restrictive temperature (25 °C) and maintained at this

 elevated temperature throughout development until the adults were imaged. Self-sterility was 
likewise induced in temperature-sensitive fer-1(b232), fer-3(hc3) and spe-9(hc52) strains.
Mating experiments
Males expressing Ppie-1::mcherry::his-58 to mark sperm nuclei (25–100 animals) were 
placed on a 35-mm NG-agar plate with a small lawn of OP50 bacteria. Hermaphrodites or 
females were transferred individually to the centre of these plates, and mating events were 
monitored using a benchtop stereomicroscope. Efficient transfer of sperm was confirmed by 
the appearance of mCherry-marked sperm in the uterus and spermatheca. When necessary, 
fluorescence intensities or mitochondrial lengths were quantified using Volocity software. 
Controls were performed to ensure that the disappearance of protein aggregates was not due 
to photobleaching.
Microscopy
Standard fluorescence imaging was performed with either an UltraVIEW Vox confocal 
imaging system (PerkinElmer), which includes an Olympus IX70 microscope, a CSU-X1 
confocal scanner (Yokogawa), 488 nm and 561 nm solid-state lasers, and Volocity software; 
or a Nikon/Andor confocal spinning disk system, equipped with a Nikon Eclipse Ti 
microscope, a CSU-X1 confocal scanner (Yokogawa), 405, 488, and 561 nm solid-state 
lasers, and NIS Elements imaging software. FRAP experiments were performed using the 
Leica TCS SP8 confocal imaging platform, equipped with a DMi8 microscope, a resonant 
scanner, and a white-light laser tuned to 488 nm for detection of GFP-tagged aggregation-
prone proteins.
Mounting worms for microscopy
Pads made of 4% agarose (GeneMate) were dried briefly on Kimwipes (Kimtech) and then 
transferred to microscope slides. Around 1 µl of 2 mM levamisole (Sigma) was pipetted onto 
the centre of the agarose pads. Animals were transferred to the levamisole drop, and a cover 
slip was placed on top before imaging.
Staining of the C. elegans germline
NG agar containing 2 µM LysoTracker Red DND-99 (Life Technologies), 2 µM LysoSensor 
Blue DND-167 (Life Technologies), 2 µM MitoTracker CM-H2TMRos (Life Technologies), 
or 2 µM DiOC6(3) (Life Technologies) was poured into petri dishes. After pouring, the 
plates were dried for 2 d. The plates were then seeded with bacterial aliquots containing 2 
µM of the respective dye and allowed to sit for 2 d. Eggs from adult animals were harvested 
by bleaching and placed on dyed NG plates. Animals were raised at 25 °C for ~3–4 d before 
imaging. A similar protocol was followed for Proteostat staining, except 1 µl of the 
Proteostat Aggresome Detection Reagent (Enzo Life Sciences) was added per 2.5 ml of NG 
agar before plate pouring, and the same dilution of this reagent was applied to bacterial 
aliquots used to seed the plates. Some knockdown experiments required animals to be 
transferred to different plates during development (see below). In these cases, consecutive 
plates contained the same dye. When gonad extrusion was required, adult animals that had 
been raised on dyed plates were nicked with a scalpel to free the gonad arm19, and then

 fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) prior to imaging. To stain 
germlines with JC-1 dye, 15 µM JC-1 (ThermoFisher) was injected into germlines, and 
animals were allowed to recover on NG agar seeded with OP50 for 4–6 h before imaging.
Imaging of metabolic sensors
The ATP:ADP ratiometric sensor PercevalHR contains a cpmVenus fluorophore flanked by 
the ADP-binding bacterial protein GlnK24. Images were acquired for the fluorophore’s two 
excitation peaks, using a 525/36 nm emission filter with excitation at 488 nm (corresponding 
to ATP-bound PercevalHR); and at 405 nm (corresponding to the ADP-bound 
PercevalHR)24. PercevalHR images are presented as a heatmap of λhigh/λlow (488 nm/405 
nm) intensities, generated using a custom LUTS profile in ImageJ. Imaging of cpmVenus 
expressed without ATP:ADP-sensitive GlnK was performed as a control, using 488 nm 
excitation and a 525/36 nm emission filter. The NADH:NAD+ ratiometric sensor Peredox 
contains a T-Sapphire fluorophore integrated within the NADH-binding bacterial protein 
Rex, along with a tandem C-terminal mCherry25. Binding of NADH increases 405 nm-
excited fluorescence through the 525/36 nm emission filter, but does not affect the 
fluorescence of the tandem mCherry (a normalizing control), which was imaged using 561 
nm excitation and a 605/70 nm emission filter.
RNA interference
All RNAi clones were from the J. Ahringer lab collection11. An empty L4440 vector was 
used as a negative control. RNAi bacteria (confirmed by DNA sequencing) were seeded onto 
NG plates supplemented with 100 ng µl−1 carbenicillin and 1.0 mM isopropyl β-D-1-
thiogalactopyranoside. Bacteria were allowed to form a lawn for 2 d at 30 °C before animals 
were transferred to plates. RNAi feeding commenced at different times of animal 
development depending on the experiment.
Knockdowns initiated at hatching—Knockdowns of autophagy genes (bec-1, lgg-1, 
and atg-9) were initiated at hatching. In brief, eggs from adult animals were harvested by 
bleaching and placed directly on RNAi bacteria. Animals were raised on RNAi bacteria for 
~3–4 d before imaging or mating on the first day of adulthood.
Knockdowns initiated at the late L4 stage—The goa-1 knockdown and knockdowns 
of all tested V-ATPase, proteasome, and mitochondrial ATP synthase genes were initiated at 
the late L4 stage. In brief, animals were raised on NG-agar plates seeded with OP50 bacteria 
until late L4, when they were washed in M9 buffer and transferred to RNAi bacteria. When 
applicable, imaging was performed 24–48 h later.
Lifespan analysis—Late L4 hermaphrodites were transferred to NG agar seeded with 
control or vha-13 RNAi bacteria. The pre-fertile period of adulthood was set as Day 0. Adult 
animals were transferred to fresh plates every 2 d. Plates were maintained at 20 °C 
throughout analysis. Animals that exploded, bagged, or crawled off plates were censored at 
the time of the event, as is standard practice.

 Drug, metabolite, and chemical treatments
To inhibit proteasome activity, adult animals were incubated overnight in S basal liquid 
medium with or without 50 µM MG132 (Sigma) at 20 °C. To neutralize lysosomal acidity 
with a weak base, adults were incubated in M9 buffer with or without 200 mM NH4Cl 
(Fisher Scientific) for 4 h at room temperature. To block V-ATPase proton pump activity, 1 
µM bafilomycin A1 (Sigma) dissolved in DMSO was injected into the gonad arms of 
hermaphrodites, and worms were allowed to recover overnight on NG agar plates before 
imaging. To eliminate mitochondrial membrane potential, adult hermaphrodites were placed 
on 60-mm NG-agar plates that had previously been spotted with 50 µl of 0.01 M antimycin 
A (Sigma) dissolved in 100% ethanol. To inhibit mitochondrial ATP-synthase activity, adult 
hermaphrodites were placed on NG-agar plates containing 50 µM oligomycin (Tocris 
Bioscience) 12 h before imaging. For ADP injection experiments, 1 mM ADP (Sigma) 
dissolved in water was loaded into microinjection needles (100 mm; World Precision 
Instruments), and injected directly into the individual oocytes of females, or hermaphrodites 
treated with ATP synthase RNAi, for immediate imaging.
RNA preparation and RT-PCR
Whole-animal RNA was isolated from control- or RNAi-treated animals using the 
PureLink™ RNA Mini Kit (Ambion). Ten animals were lysed per sample, and RNA was 
extracted according to the manufacturer’s protocol. First strand cDNA was synthesized from 
RNA samples using a oligo(dT)18 primer and the Maxima H Minus First Strand cDNA 
Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific). bec-1, atg-9, and act-1 cDNA fragments were then 
amplified using internal primers that spanned exon/exon boundaries. Amplified products 
were resolved on a 1% agarose gel stained with 1× SYBR Safe (Invitrogen).
Maturation and imaging of Xenopus oocytes
Defolliculated Xenopus laevis oocytes were provided by Ecocyte Bioscience. After washing 
in OR2 liquid medium (82.5 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM 
Na2HPO4, 5 mM HEPES pH 7.8), oocytes were stained with 500 nM LysoTracker Red 
DND-99 (Life Technologies) and incubated with or without 5 µg ml−1 progesterone (Sigma–
Aldrich) for at least 10 h at room temperature. For imaging, oocytes were transferred to 1/3× 
OR2 liquid medium containing 5% Ficoll PM 400 (Sigma–Aldrich) and placed in 1/16-inch 
diameter holes created by steel balls (VXB Bearing) in 2% agarose pads.
Statistical analysis and quantification
Statistical tests with appropriate underlying assumptions on data distribution and variance 
were used. No statistical method was employed to predetermine sample size. The 
experiments were not randomized, except that animals were pooled before being exposed to 
different experimental conditions. The investigators were not blinded to allocation during 
experiments or analysis. Statistical analysis and graphing were performed using GraphPad 
Prism 6 for Mac OS X. All nnumbers refer to sample size.
General scoring of phenotypes—Experiments to determine percentages of germlines 
with protein aggregation, acidic lysosomes, proximal GLD-1, mitochondrial ROS, or

 mitochondrial membrane potential were performed for least three biological replicates, and 
50 animals were scored for each genotype or condition per trial. Where pertinent, mean 
percentages are plotted with s.d., and unpaired, two-tailed t-tests were performed using 
Prism software to determine statistical significance. When different genotypes or conditions 
resulted in opposite phenotypes entirely (that is, 0% versus 100%), sample size and 
percentages are noted in the text (Figs 2g, 2h, 3f, 3g and 5a).
Protein-aggregate fluorescence with mating—Average pixel intensities were 
measured for set bounding areas in ImageJ. Fluorescence intensities were compared either 
before and after mating a female, or over the course of an hour for non-mated control 
worms. Individual data points are plotted along with s.d. for each aggregation-prone protein 
at the different time points in each experiment, and a paired, two-tailed t-test was performed 
using Prism software to determine statistical significance.
Recovery of fluorescence after photobleaching—Relative fluorescence intensity 
(RFI) for a region of interest (ROI) was determined from the equation RFI = (Tt/Ct)/(T0/C0), 
where T0 is the intensity in the ROI before photobleaching; Tt, the intensity in the ROI at a 
defined time after photobleaching; C0, the intensity in the non-bleached part of the structure 
before photobleaching; and Ct, the intensity in the non-bleached part of the structure after 
photobleaching. All intensities were measured using ImageJ software and corrected for 
background before calculations were performed. Three biological replicates were performed 
in hermaphrodites and females for each protein. Mean RFI at each time point is plotted with 
s.d.
Quantification of lifespan—Lifespan following control (n = 244 animals) or vha-13 
RNAi (n = 282 animals) was analysed using OASIS36(http://sbi.postech.ac.kr/oasis). Mean 
lifespans are noted in plots.
Co-localization of acidic lysosomes and the V-ATPase—Puncta in the most 
proximal oocyte in ten different hermaphrodites were scored. Puncta were grouped into 
three categories: those positive for LysoTracker alone, those positive for the V-ATPase alone, 
and those positive for both LysoTracker and the V-ATPase. Mean percentages are plotted 
with s.d. for each category.
Co-localization of protein aggregates with lysosomes during clearance—
NMY-2::GFP protein aggregates were tracked together with LMP-1::mCherry in five 
different females that had been mated. Aggregates (n = 34) were grouped into those that 
showed clear association with lysosomes at their disappearance, and those that disappeared 
without showing lysosome association (perhaps owing to loss in tracking between frames).
Gradients of V-ATPase and Peredox fluorescence intensities in the germline—
Using ImageJ software, GFP::VHA-13 fluorescence intensities were scored along a medial 
line tracking from distal to proximal regions of the germline. Positions along the tracked line 
were normalized for hermaphrodite and female worms. In addition, summed GFP::VHA-13 
fluorescence intensities for set areas in distal and proximal regions were scored using 
ImageJ, and ratios of distal-to-proximal fluorescence intensities were averaged for ten

 germlines per genotype. Mean ratios are plotted with s.d., and an unpaired, two-tailed t-test 
was performed using Prism software to determine statistical significance. Peredox 
fluorescence (in both green and red channels) was also scored along a line that spanned the 
proximal germline using ImageJ software.
Mitochondrial fluorescence intensities—Summed MitoLS::GFP or DiOC6(3) 
fluorescence intensities for set areas in distal and/or proximal regions were scored using 
ImageJ. Ratios of proximal-to-distal fluorescence intensities were averaged for at least ten 
germlines per genotype or condition. Mean ratios are plotted with s.d., and unpaired, two-
tailed t-tests were performed using Prism software to determine statistical significance. 
DiOC6(3) fluorescence intensities before and after ADP (or vehicle) injection were scored 
for five animals each. Where appropriate, DiOC6(3) fluorescence is presented as a heatmap 
generated using a custom LUTS profile in ImageJ.
Lengths of germline mitochondria—Mitochondrial lengths (scored using Volocity 
software) were determined for distal germ cells and proximal oocytes of hermaphrodites, 
proximal oocytes of hermaphrodites treated with vha-13 RNAi, and proximal oocytes of 
females. At least 30 different mitochondria were scored for each genotype or condition (as 
noted in figures). Mean mitochondrial lengths with s.d. are plotted for each genotype or 
condition, and an unpaired, two-tailed t-test was performed using Prism software to 
determine statistical significance. Similar analyses were performed for the mitochondria of 
oocytes of females before and after mating.
Quantification of LGG-1-positive autophagosomes—LGG-1 puncta were counted 
in the most proximal oocyte of wild-type hermaphrodites and females, or in hermaphrodites 
treated with control or lgg-1 RNAi. At least 30 worms were analysed for each genotype or 
condition. The mean number of LGG-1-positive puncta is presented with s.d. for each 
genotype or condition, and an unpaired, two-tailed t-test was performed using Prism 
software to determine statistical significance.
Relative expression of autophagy gene transcripts—RT–PCR experiments were 
performed in triplicate. Band intensities were quantified using ImageJ software. Band 
intensities for autophagy transcripts were normalized to act-1, which encodes a C. elegans 
actin isoform. The average normalized intensity for control experiments was set to an 
arbitrary value of 1. Mean normalized intensities are plotted with s.d. for each condition, and 
an unpaired, two-tailed t-test was performed using Prism software to determine statistical 
significance.

 Figure 5. Conservation and model of a germline lysosomal switch
a, LysoTracker-stained Xenopus oocytes. Bar, 20 µm. b, In C. elegans, arrested oocytes 
exhibit a relaxation in proteostasis, which is reversed just before fertilization when sperm 
signalling relieves GLD-1-mediated repression of V-ATPase synthesis. Activated lysosomes 
enhance oocyte proteostasis by engulfing and clearing protein aggregates, and by promoting 
a metabolic shift from a primed, quiescent state accompanied by elevated ROS to an active 
metabolic state that supports aggregate mobilization for removal. This mechanism may also 
underlie the sperm-dependent clearance of carbonylated proteins5.
