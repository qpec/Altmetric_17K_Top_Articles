Abstract
This study sought to examine whether Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participation and
benefit levels are associated with reduced subsequent hospital and emergency department utilization in low-income
older adults. Study participants were 68,956 Maryland residents aged ‡65 years who were dually enrolled in
Medicare and Medicaid (2009–2012). Annual inpatient hospital days and costs and emergency department visits
were modeled as a function of either 1-year lagged SNAP participation or lagged SNAP benefit amounts, controlling
for sociodemographic characteristics, autoregressive effects, year, health status, and Medicaid participation. SNAP
participation (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=0.96, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.93, 0.99), and, among participants,
each $10 increase in monthly benefits (aOR=0.99, 95% CI: 0.99–0.99) are associated with a reduced likelihood of
hospitalization, but not emergency department use. The authors estimate that enrolling the 47% of the 2012
population who were eligible nonparticipants in SNAP could have been associated with $19 million in hospital cost
savings. Accounting for the strong effects of health care access, this study finds that SNAP is associated with reduced
hospitalization in dually eligible older adults. Policies to increase SNAP participation and benefit amounts in eligible
older adults may reduce hospitalizations and health care costs for older dual eligible adults living in the community.

Introduction
O
ne third of US older adults, comprising 13 million
older adults, currently live on incomes less than 200% of
the poverty level, according to Census data. It has long been
known that adults living under or near the poverty line rely
more heavily on emergency department (ED)-based health
care and are hospitalized more often than their higher income
peers.1,2 Excess hospital utilization in this population was
once believed to be preventable by improving health care
access. However, disparities exist among older adults who
have health insurance through Medicare,1 and are not at-
tributable to access to primary care providers.3,4 One study
found that non–health sector resources are associated with a
reduced risk of hospital readmission in low-income older
adults,5 suggesting that social determinants of health affect
hospital utilization.
Social service programs exist to help low-income seniors
meet their basic needs. Specifically, food assistance pro-
grams, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Pro-
gram (SNAP), provide supplemental household income for
food, and may therefore improve health outcomes for lower
income older adults. SNAP provided, on average, $129 in
supplemental monthly income for an average of 1.3 people in
an older adult household in 2014.6 This transfer comprises a
relatively large supplemental income source for these adults,

 whose average monthly gross income was $876.6 Also, by tar-
geting financial support toward food needs, SNAP can improve
access to a higher quality diet for food insecure adults.7 There is
evidence of reduced caloric intake, poorer dietary quality,8 and
greater risk of hypoglycemia9 for low-income adults at the end of
the month when funds run low. Therefore, greater SNAP benefits
mayfacilitatechronicdiseasemanagementfornutrition-sensitive
conditions, which may account for evidence of reduced chronic
disease hospital utilization.10 Also, because adults with food in-
security also often report cost-related medication nonadherence
and difficulty paying bills,11,12food assistancemay allow them to
use their limited money for medications and other health-related
necessities.
Several studies have tested whether SNAP is associated
with reduced hospital utilization, but results are inconsistent.
For example, Medicaid inpatient hospital spending growth
declined in Massachusetts following an increase in SNAP
benefit amounts in that state10 and results were most dramatic
among those with nutrition-sensitive chronic conditions, sug-
gesting that improved chronic disease management contrib-
uted to the decline. However, in a study of older patients with
diabetes that adjusted for self-management behaviors, SNAP
participants had similar Medicare spending and a 7% greater
risk of hospitalization than their peers.13 These results con-
tradict the hypothesis that SNAP participation is associated
with reduced hospitalization, but may be biased by adjusting
for self-management, because SNAP’s effect on hospitaliza-
tion likely is partly related to improved disease management.
Understanding how SNAP relates to health outcomes of
low-income older adults is particularly important and timely
in light of recent interest in innovative approaches that
target the social needs of older adults.14 Approximately 42%
of income-eligible older adults participate in SNAP.15 Al-
though expanding access to SNAP and increasing SNAP
benefits would undoubtedly increase benefit expenditures,
program costs are modest relative to hospital and emergency
care costs. Understanding how SNAP participation and ben-
efit amounts affect hospital utilization could inform policy
directed at improving the value and impact of federal enti-
tlement programs. Therefore, this study sought to quantify
SNAP participation rates in a population of low-income older
Maryland residents dually eligible for Medicare and Medic-
aid and test 2 hypotheses in this population. First, the study
team hypothesized that SNAP participation is associated with
reduced subsequent hospital utilization. Second, the team
hypothesized that greater SNAP benefits are associated with
reduced hospital utilization among participants. Dually eli-
gible older adults are all likely income eligible for SNAP and
have claims data suitable for these analyses.
Methods
The sample for this study was comprised of the population
of Maryland residents aged 65 years and older who were
dually enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid at any time be-
tween 2010 and 2012. Because Medicaid income eligibility
criteria were more stringent than those for SNAP, all were
likely income eligible for SNAP. Study inclusion was deter-
mined for each calendar year. Hospital utilization was esti-
mated as a function of prior year’s SNAP participation and
benefit amount. Nursing home residents are not eligible for
SNAP. Therefore, individuals were excluded who resided in a
nursing home for 9 months or more of the prior year, because
they likely would not have had sufficient opportunity to enroll
in SNAP during the prior calendar year. Individuals who were
enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare and enrolled in Medicaid
for at least 1 month during the calendar year were included for
that year. Individuals who enrolled in Medicare or died during
the calendar year were excluded if they had less than 6 months
of claims data for the year, as in prior work.16 Medicare
Advantage enrollees were excluded because full claims data
for hospital ascertainment were not available.
Medicaid claims and sociodemographic data were merged
with Medicare claims and SNAP program utilization data.
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards
at Johns Hopkins Medicine and University of Maryland,
Baltimore County. A crosswalk between Medicare and
Medicaid recipients’ IDs generated for research purposes
enabled data merging. The dependent variables in this study
included annual inpatient hospital day count, annual inpa-
tient hospital cost, and annual ED visit count, including
visits that resulted in an inpatient admission and those re-
solved on an outpatient basis. The dependent variables were
measured during each year, 2010–2012, while SNAP vari-
ables were measured from 2009–2011 to capture lagged
effects. It was not possible to measure ED costs separately
from inpatient hospital cost for visits resulting in admission.
Inpatient hospital cost was measured by the total payment
amount in Medicare claims data because Medicare is the
primary payer of hospital care for dually eligible adults.
SNAP participants were compared to nonparticipants.
Because individuals self-select into SNAP and may quali-
tatively differ from nonparticipants, the study team also
measured the average benefit amount among participants
(scaled in $10 increments) to evaluate potential dose re-
sponse. Both SNAP variables were treated as time variant
and modeled with 1-year lags, meaning that outcomes were
regressed on the prior year’s SNAP values.17 Lagged models
minimize the threat of reverse causality, whereby indi-
viduals in poorer health select into SNAP participation.
Sociodemographic variables included sex, race/ethnicity
(analyzed as black, white, Hispanic, other and unknown
[ref]), age, annual household income (in $1000 increments),
and dummy variables indicating partially Medicaid eligible
(ie, eligible for assistance with Medicare premiums and cost
sharing, but not for full Medicaid coverage) and Medicaid
eligibility based on medically needy spend down, both of
which were considered to be socioeconomic proxies. Because
poor health may contribute to both SNAP participation and
hospital utilization, the study team measured the number of
chronic conditions defined by a modified version of the
Chronic Conditions Warehouse algorithm,18 based on diag-
nosis codes in either Medicare and Medicaid claims. Receipt
of the Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services
Waiver, which indicates functional limitations, was measured
as a dichotomous variable. Finally, because older adults who
participate in SNAP also may be more continuously enrolled
in Medicaid, and because more continuous Medicaid partic-
ipation is strongly associated with hospital utilization in du-
ally eligible older adults,5,19 the study team measured the
proportion of the year enrolled in Medicaid. Covariate data,
except for chronic condition values, were drawn exclusively
from Medicaid data, and all covariates were treated as time
variant, except for sex and race/ethnicity.
FOOD ASSISTANCE AND HOSPITAL UTILIZATION
89
 Statistical approach
SNAP participation and benefit amounts were modeled
with 1-year lags in separate models. Zero-inflated negative
binomial regression models estimated inpatient days and ED
visits. The zero-inflated negative binomial fit the skewed
distribution of inpatient hospital days and ED visits best
because of the large frequency of nonusers during the year.
Correlated outcomes were addressed by adjusting for auto-
regressive effects and applying robust standard error esti-
mates.17 Time trends were addressed by adjusting for study
year. Model 1 adjusted for sex, race/ethnicity, age, annual
income, partially Medicaid eligible, Medicaid spend down
eligibility, study year, autoregressive effects, chronic con-
dition count, and Medicaid community waiver status. Model
2 additionally adjusted for proportion of the year partici-
pating in Medicaid. The inpatient hospital cost models are
similar in concept, using a Heckman 2-step selection model
for the same reason as the zero-inflated negative binomial
model: there is a preponderance of zero utilization in any
given year and a skewed distribution of spending. The
Heckman model uses a probit specification in the first step to
indicate a propensity for zero versus nonzero spending, and
the second step is a weighted ordinary least squares speci-
fication of the amount of spending, conditioned on the
propensity to be selected into the group of persons having
hospital costs. Inpatient hospital cost models adjusted for all
covariates.
Results from the Heckman 2-stage model also were used
to estimate the potential cost implications of expanding
access to SNAP to nonparticipants in 2012. Results from the
first stage were used to estimate potential savings attribut-
able to fewer hospital admissions and results from the sec-
ond stage were used to estimate the potential savings
attributable to less costly stays if admitted. The fully ad-
justed results from the first stage of the Heckman model
provide the predicted difference in probability of hospital
admission between SNAP participants and nonparticipants,
assuming mean values for all model covariates. This value
was then multiplied by the number of SNAP nonparticipants
and the average cost of inpatient hospitalization to estimate
the potential cost savings attributable to averted hospital
admissions. The fully adjusted results from the second stage
of the Heckman model provide the estimated percent re-
duction in cost among those admitted. This was multiplied
by the expected number of hospitalizations in SNAP non-
participants to calculate the potential cost savings attribut-
able to less costly stays. The total potential cost savings is
the sum of the cost results from both stages.
Results
A total of 68,956 older adults in Maryland were dually
enrolled in both fee-for-service Medicare and Medicaid and
were eligible for this study at some point during 2010–2012.
Of those, 53,646 individuals were eligible for the study in
2012, the most recent year of data. In 2012, 26% of par-
ticipants were hospitalized and approximately 53% were
enrolled in SNAP (Table 1). SNAP participants had a 3
percentage point lower likelihood than SNAP nonpartici-
pants of being hospitalized, a 1 percentage point lower
likelihood of having an ED visit, and were more likely to be
younger, female, and black, Hispanic, or other race com-
pared with being white or having unknown race/ethnicity.
They were less likely to be partially eligible for Medicaid.
Rates for hospitalization and the sociodemographic profile
of the population remained mostly consistent across obser-
vation years (see online Supplementary Table S1; Supple-
mentary Data are available online at www.liebertpub.com/
pop). The average cost for inpatient admissions for partici-
pants hospitalized in 2012 was $25,091.
Adjusting for sociodemographic and health characteris-
tics, (Table 2, Model 1), SNAP participants had, on average,
14% lower odds of hospitalization and 10% lower odds of
an ED visit in the subsequent year than nonparticipants.
These associations were attenuated after additionally ad-
justing for Medicaid participation, but SNAP participation
continued to be statistically significantly associated with 4%
reduced odds of hospitalization in the final model (Model
2). Likewise, in models that adjusted for sociodemographic
and health characteristics, SNAP participants had a 10%
lower likelihood for each additional inpatient day if hospi-
talized and a 4% lower likelihood of each additional ED
visit if they utilized it (Model 1), but SNAP participation
was not associated with either outcome after additional
adjustment for Medicaid participation. Adjusting for socio-
demographic and health characteristics in SNAP partici-
pants, a $10 increase in monthly benefit amount was
associated with 2% lower odds of either hospitalization
or ED utilization (Model 1). In models that additionally
adjusted for Medicaid participation, a $10 increase in
monthly SNAP benefit continued to be statistically signifi-
cantly associated with 1% reduced odds of hospitalization.
Full model results are reported in Supplementary Tables S2
and S3.
In fully adjusted models, SNAP participants were 1.5
percentage points less likely to incur an inpatient hospital
expense (ie, be hospitalized; Table 3). Among those who
were hospitalized, SNAP participants had 5.8% lower ex-
penses than nonparticipants. Therefore, the study team es-
timates that expanding SNAP benefits to the 25,018
nonparticipants in 2012 could have been associated with
total savings of $19 million, with approximately half of the
savings ($9.4 million) related to an estimated 375 averted
admissions and the other half ($9.7 million) related to less
costly hospital stays (Table 4). Among SNAP participants, a
$10 increase in SNAP was associated with a 0.2 percentage
point lower probability of incurring inpatient-related hos-
pital costs and a 1% lower average inpatient cost for those
who were hospitalized (Table 3).This savings is not included
in the cost savings estimation to avoid double counting.
Discussion
Results from this study indicate that SNAP participation
and increased SNAP benefits among participants were as-
sociated with reduced hospitalization rates, but not ED visit
rates, in dually eligible older adults. Notably, in this study of
older adults who should be eligible, only about half partic-
ipated in SNAP. Despite the vast body of literature doc-
umenting poor health in low-income older adults, effective
strategies to improve health outcomes for this vulnerable
group remain scant. In this study, SNAP benefits were re-
lated to lower hospital utilization in a population that was
continuously enrolled in Medicare and in regression models

 that adjust for the proportion of the year enrolled in Med-
icaid. It is notable that all had access to both Medicare and
Medicaid because policy makers have increased access to
health care for low-income groups thinking that that alone
would reduce high hospital utilization in low-income groups.
Indeed, SNAP associations in this study were attenuated after
adjusting for the proportion of the year with Medicaid cov-
erage, and evidence elsewhere shows that continuous Med-
icaid coverage predicts less hospital-based care.19 However,
results from the present study add to evidence1,3–5 suggesting
that high hospital utilization is attributable to both social and
medical determinants of health. More specifically, these results
identify food assistance as a social determinant of hospital uti-
lization, but not ED utilization. Therefore, SNAP may predict
fewer hospital admissions, even if it does not decrease the fre-
quency of ED visits. Results from other studies suggest that
improving health care access also may not reduce ED utiliza-
tion.20,21 Together, these results suggest that hospital and ED
utilization are attributable to different mechanisms. Importantly,
inpatient hospital admission is determined by health care pro-
viders, whereas visiting the ED is generally the decision of the
individual. Therefore, inpatient hospital utilization is likely a
better measure of individual health status than ED utilization.
These findings supplement evidence that investment in
SNAP may improve health outcomes and reduce inpatient
hospital spending. For example, the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009, which expanded SNAP eligi-
bility and increased the benefit amount, has been credited
with reducing the prevalence of food insecurity in SNAP
income-eligible US households by 2%22 and may have
slowed growth in Medicaid inpatient hospital spending.10
These results build on prior studies by demonstrating that
not only SNAP participation, but greater benefit amounts
among participants, is associated with reduced hospitaliza-
tion rates. This is notable because participation is suscepti-
ble to self-selection, but benefit amounts are assigned based
largely on household financial need. Therefore, benefit
amount results are less susceptible to confounding and re-
verse causality than participation results.

SAMUEL ET AL.
 In this study, SNAP participation also was associated with
less costly stays among those who were hospitalized. Based
on the models, the study team estimates that expanding
SNAP access to nonparticipating dual eligible older adults
in Maryland could have resulted in inpatient hospital cost
savings of $19 million in 2012. Based on the average per
capita costs of the SNAP program, the team estimates that
the federal government would spend approximately $39
million if they extended SNAP benefits to the 2012 income-
eligible nonparticipants in the study sample. Therefore, ig-
noring issues of inefficiencies in taxation, approximately
half of the cost of administering SNAP could be recouped
by the federal government in reduced Medicare inpatient
hospital spending. Further work is needed to quantify the
potential savings attributable to changes in other health care
utilization outcomes.
There are at least 2 potential reasons for the associations
found in this study. First, SNAP participation reduces food
insecurity23,24 and minimizes the adverse effect of food
insecurity on dietary quality and obesity.7 This is notewor-
thy because food insecurity is linked to worse dietary
quality,8 increased risk of chronic diseases,25 and increased
risk of hospitalization.26 Therefore, it is plausible that im-
proved access to SNAP and increased benefits for partici-
pants may improve food security and dietary quality in
households of low-income older adults, and this may reduce
hospital utilization.
An alternative potential reason for these results is that
SNAP provides supplemental income that reduces financial
strain for older adults living under or near the poverty line.
Financial strain, or the lack of adequate money for basic
needs, is linked with earlier mortality27 and greater risk for
both malnutrition28 and disability,29 which contribute to
hospitalization.5,30 Individuals experiencing financial strain
struggle to afford food, heat, and health care,11,12 and may
be forced to choose between these basic needs. Therefore,
improving access to programs meeting any basic need will
improve an individual’s ability to afford the other basic
needs. This idea is consistent with evidence of increased
access to food after implementation of Medicare Part D,
which improved financial access to medications for older
adults.31 Therefore, it is also plausible that any supplemental
income could be associated with reduced subsequent hospital-
based care for low-income older adults because it enhances
their ability to meet basic needs and reduces finance-related
stress exposure.
Limitations and strengths
As with other SNAP studies, SNAP participants may differ
from nonparticipants on unmeasured characteristics. This
may have biased associations and the study cost savings
calculations. For example, older adults who do not receive
SNAP may benefit from other meal assistance programs, such
as Meals on Wheels or congregate meals. This likely would
bias associations toward the null because of unmeasured re-
ceipt of food assistance in the control group. Conversely,
older adults who participate in SNAP may be more likely to
enroll in other public benefits programs, which could con-
found results if such programs collectively reduce hospital
utilization. Also, this study is limited to an older adult pop-
ulation, precluding measurement of the cumulative lifetime
participation in food programs, and making results suscepti-
ble to survival bias. Conversely, however, these results sug-
gest that greater SNAP benefits may confer a health benefit for
low-income adults, even at older ages. In addition, lag times
for potential health effects of food assistance programs
are unknown. Lagged effects may be longer than the 1 year
modeled in this study, so the associations between SNAP and
hospital utilization may be underestimated. Conversely, the
study team could have missed key proximal effects by lagging
the models for a year. Also, averted hospital stays may differ
in cost from the typical hospital stay, which would bias the
cost savings estimate. This study is strengthened by using data
for an entire state population of dually eligible older adults,
reducing nonresponse bias in a low-income group. Also, this
study is less susceptible to reverse causality than previous
cross-sectional studies because of use of lagged exposure
modeling.
Public Health Implications
This study found low rates of SNAP program participa-
tion (only 53% participated in the most recent study year) in
the population of dually eligible Maryland older adults, all
of whom are likely income eligible for SNAP. National data
estimates a participation rate of 42% among income eligible
older adults,15 suggesting that the program is underutilized.
Results from this study suggest that improved access to SNAP
may reduce hospitalization for low-income older adults. To-
gether, these results suggest that strategies to improve access
to SNAP for eligible older adults likely will improve health
outcomes, despite years of accumulated exposure to food
insecurity and financial strain in this population. These results
have implications for practice and policy.
Practice implications
Efforts to increase SNAP participation may include tar-
geted eligibility screening and enrollment assistance. Older
adults tend to underutilize the program.15 Health care pro-
viders and health care payers can invest in efforts to screen for
food insecurity and income eligibility for SNAP and facilitate
SNAP enrollment.32 Resources are available to support en-
rollment and advocacy efforts nationally and state-level ad-
vocacy organizations. Community health workers, primary
care provider practices, and not-for-profit service providers
are well positioned to provide such screening and referral, but
they need to be compensated and supported for services to
address social and economic determinants of health.
Policy implications
Policy actions can improve access to SNAP and increase
benefit amounts. Several specific policy strategies can facil-
itate the SNAP enrollment process for older adults. First,
states can reduce enrollment requirements by implementing
the Elderly Simplified Application Project. This program,
implemented in 7 states,33 streamlines income and expense
verification by matching data from existing sources, extends
certification periods to 36 months, and waives the re-
certification interview.34 Second, states can coordinate SNAP
and Supplemental Security Income enrollment, as is done in
the Combined Application Project.35 This program increased
SNAP participation rates in South Carolina at a time when

 national rates were declining35 and is currently implemented
in 18 states.33 Third, states can leverage administrative data
from Medicaid, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance
Program (LIHEAP), and SNAP programs, as Maryland has,
to identify income eligible older adults who are not enrolled
in SNAP and conduct targeted outreach to increase par-
ticipation.36 The Affordable Care Act incentivizes states to
harmonize administrative data sets to facilitate Medicaid
enrollment, and these efforts can facilitate SNAP enrollment
as well.
Besides enhancing beneficiary access, states can enhance
benefit amounts for vulnerable older adults. For example,
the State of Maryland recently passed legislation ensuring
that all SNAP beneficiaries aged 62 and older receive a
minimum benefit of $30 monthly by supplementing the
federal benefit with state funds as needed. Furthermore,
efforts to significantly cut federal spending on SNAP ben-
efits through block granting or other structural changes may
have adverse consequences.
Conclusion
This study found that SNAP participation and greater
benefit amounts are associated with lower inpatient hospital
utilization in a state population of low-income older adults.
These findings have public health implications because the
majority of US older adults who are income eligible for
SNAP do not participate. As public and private sector health
care partners shift to outcomes-driven, value-based care,
social service programs such as SNAP will be a critical tool
in improving health outcomes for low-income seniors across
the country.
