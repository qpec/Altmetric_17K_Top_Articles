IMPORTANCE Anorexia nervosa (AN) is associated with adolescent onset, severe low body
weight, and high mortality as well as high harm avoidance. The brain reward system could
have an important role in the perplexing drive for thinness and food avoidance in AN.
OBJECTIVE To test whether brain reward learning response to taste in adolescent AN is
altered and associated with treatment response, striatal-hypothalamic connectivity, and
elevated harm avoidance.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this cross-sectional multimodal brain imaging study,
adolescents and young adults with AN were matched with healthy controls at a university
brain imaging facility and eating disorder treatment program. During a sucrose taste classical
conditioning paradigm, violations of learned associations between conditioned visual and
unconditioned taste stimuli evoked the dopamine-related prediction error (PE). Dynamic
effective connectivity during sweet taste receipt was studied to investigate hierarchical brain
activation across the brain network that regulates eating. The study was conducted from July
2012 to May 2017, and data were analyzed from June 2017 to December 2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prediction error brain reward response across the insula,
caudate, and orbitofrontal cortex; dynamic effective connectivity between hypothalamus
and ventral striatum; and treatment weight gain, harm avoidance scores, and salivary cortisol
levels and their correlations with PE brain response.
RESULTS Of 56 female participants with AN included in the study, the mean (SD) age was 16.6
(2.5) years, and the mean (SD) body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms
divided by height in meters squared) was 15.9 (0.9); of 52 matched female controls, the mean
(SD) age was 16.0 (2.8) years, and the mean (SD) BMI was 20.9 (2.1). Prediction error
response was elevated in participants with AN in the caudate head, nucleus accumbens, and
insula (multivariate analysis of covariance: Wilks λ, 0.707; P = .02; partial η2 = 0.296), which
correlated negatively with sucrose taste pleasantness. Bilateral AN orbitofrontal gyrus rectus
PE response was positively correlated with harm avoidance (right ρ, 0.317; 95% CI, 0.091 to
0.539; P < .02; left ρ, 0.336; 95% CI, 0.112 to 0.550; P < .01) but negatively correlated with
treatment BMI change (right ρ, −0.282; 95% CI, −0.534 to −0.014; P < .04; left ρ, −0.268;
95% CI, −0.509 to −0.018; P < .045). Participants with AN showed effective connectivity
from ventral striatum to hypothalamus, and connectivity strength was positively correlated
with insula and orbitofrontal PE response. Right frontal cortex PE response was associated
with cortisol, which correlated with body dissatisfaction.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These results further support elevated PE signal in AN and
suggest a link between PE and elevated harm avoidance, brain connectivity, and weight gain
in AN. Prediction error may have a central role in adolescent AN in driving anxiety and ventral
striatal-hypothalamus circuit-controlled food avoidance.

and young women, and its mortality rate exceeds that of other
psychiatricdisorders.2Self-starvationandfearofweightgainde-
spite severe underweight and risk of death have been puzzling,
and finding comprehensive brain-based models that could ex-

Methods
Participants
Fifty-six female adolescents and young adults with AN (age
range, 11-21 years) and 52 healthy matched control partici-
pants (age range, 11-21 years) were included in this study
(Table 1).37-41 The AN group was recruited from partial hospi-
talizationtreatment,wherecloselysupervisedmealplansmiti-
gated confounding brain effects of acute starvation or
dehydration.42 Treatment involved a highly structured pro-
gram aimed at weight restoration over 5 weeks, including par-
enttraininginmealsupportaccordingtothefamily-basedtreat-
ment model.43 Control participants were recruited through
local advertisements. In the AN group, 53 participants were di-
agnosed as having pure restricting type and 3 as having infre-
quent purge episodes (less than once a month), and all 56 par-
ticipants with AN fell below the 10th percentile for body mass
index(BMI;calculatedasweightinkilogramsdividedbyheight
in meters squared) for age. All participants underwent func-
tionalmagneticresonanceimaging(fMRI);individualswithAN
were without menses and controls were in the early follicular
phase to control for sex hormone effects. Participants 18 years
orolder,including19participantswithANand11controls,were
administered the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 by
a doctoral-level interviewer. Those younger than 18 years com-
pleted the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview.44
Participants were right-handed and had no history of head
trauma, neurological disease, major medical illness, psycho-
sis, or substance use disorders. Six participants with AN and
11 controls were taking oral contraceptives. Twenty-six par-
ticipants with AN were taking antidepressants, and 7 were tak-
ing atypical antipsychotics. The Colorado Multiple institu-
tional review board approved the study. All participants
provided written informed consent.
Self-Assessments
In addition to diagnostic interviews, participants completed
a battery of self-assessments. Participants completed the Eat-
ing Disorder Inventory–3,37 Revised Sensitivity to Punish-
ment and Reward Questionnaire,38 State-Trait Anxiety
Inventory,39 Temperament and Character Inventory,40 and
Children’
s Depression Inventory.41
Key Points
Question How does brain response in participants with
adolescent anorexia nervosa (AN) compare with healthy controls
during taste reward conditioning?
Findings In this cross-sectional multimodal brain imaging study of
56 female adolescents and young adults with AN and 52 matched
controls, the AN group showed hyperactivation in the caudate
head, nucleus accumbens, and insula compared with controls
during a classical conditioning paradigm that has been associated
with dopamine function. Orbitofrontal brain response in the AN
group was positively associated with harm avoidance and
striatal-hypothalamic connectivity but negatively associated with
change in body mass index during treatment.
Meanings Altered brain reward response in adolescent AN may
indicate altered dopamine function, may have a key role in AN’
s
specific pathophysiology, and should be explored as a target for
biological treatments.

 Brain Imaging Methods
fMRI Image Acquisition
Between 7:00 AM and 9:00 AM on the study day, participants
withANatetheirmealplanbreakfastandcontrolsateaquality-
matchedandcalorie-matchedbreakfast(Table1).Brainimaging
was performed between 8:00 AM and 9:00 AM using the 3T
Signa scanner (General Electric Company) or Skyra 3T scan-
ner (Siemens) using the following criteria: 3-plane scout scan
(16 seconds), sagittally acquired, spoiled gradient sequence T1-
weighted (172 slices; thickness, 1 mm; inversion time, 450 ms;
repetition time, 8 ms; echo time, 4 ms; flip angle, 12°; field of
view, 22 cm; scan matrix, 64 × 64), and T2-weighted echo pla-
nar scans for blood oxygen level–dependent functional activ-
ity (3.4 × 3.4 × 2.6-mm voxels; repetition time, 2100 ms; echo
time, 30 ms; flip angle, 70°; 28 axial slices; thickness, 2.6 mm;
gap, 1.4 mm) (eMethods 1 in the Supplement).
Taste Reward Task
The design of this study was adapted from O’
Doherty et al19
(eAppendix 1 in the Supplement). Participants learned to as-
sociate 3 unconditioned taste stimuli (1 molar sucrose solu-
tion, no solution, or artificial saliva) with paired conditioned
visual stimuli. Each conditioned visual stimulus was proba-
bilistically associated with its unconditioned taste stimulus
such that 20% of sucrose and no solution conditioned visual
stimulus trials were unexpectedly followed by no solution and
sucroseunconditionedtastestimuli,respectively.Tastestimuli
were applied using a customized programmable syringe pump
(J-Kem Scientific) and E-Prime software version 2 (Psycho-
logical Software Tools).45
fMRI Analysis
Image preprocessing and analysis were performed using sta-
tistical parametric mapping version 12 (Welcome Trust Cen-
tre for Neuroimaging). Images were realigned to the first vol-
ume, normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute
template, and smoothed at 6-mm full width at half maxi-
mum gaussian kernel. Data were preprocessed with slice time
correction and modeled with a hemodynamic response con-
volved function using the general linear model, including tem-
poral and dispersion derivatives. A 128-second high-pass
filter was applied for low-frequency blood oxygen level–
dependent signal fluctuations and motion parameters as first-
level analysis regressors.
PE Analysis
Each participant’
s PE signal was modeled based on trial se-
quence (absolute of positive and negative PE) and regressed
with brain activation across all trials19,21,22 (eMethods 2 in the
Supplement). We extracted mean parameter estimates across
all voxels from 18 predefined anatomical regions of interest
(ROIs) based on previous studies,22 including the bilateral dor-
sal anterior insula, ventral anterior insula, caudate head, or-
bitofrontalcortex(OFC)gyrusrectus,medialOFC,middleOFC,
inferior OFC, ventral striatum,46 and nucleus accumbens47

Statistical Analysis
SPSSStatistics25(IBM)wasusedforstatisticalanalyses.Demo-
graphic and behavior data were analyzed using t test. Ex-
tracted regional brain activation parameter estimates were
tested for normality with the Shapiro-Wilk test, rank-
transformed when nonnormally distributed, and analyzed
using multivariate analysis of variance and multivariate analy-
sis of covariance with covariates to account for confounding
factors, such as comorbidity or medication, as in previous
studies.22Spearmanrankwasusedforcorrelationanalysesand
controlled for multiple comparisons using bootstrapping pro-
cedures (1000 samples).50 All P values were 2-tailed, and a P
value less than .05 was considered significant. Results were
corrected for multiple comparison.
Results
Demographic and Behavioral Data
There were no significant group differences for age, breakfast
calories, or sucrose pleasantness or sweetness ratings (Table 1).
Participants with AN had significantly lower age-adjusted BMI
percentileandnovelty-seekingscores.ParticipantswithANalso
had elevated drive for thinness and body dissatisfaction and
significantly higher HA, punishment sensitivity, state and trait
anxiety, and depression scores.
Brain Imaging Results
PE ROI Analysis
Results were nonnormally distributed. Multivariate analysis
of variance (no covariates) resulted in a Wilks λ of 0.642
(P < .001; partial η2 = 0.358), with associations with bilateral
caudate head, ventral striatum, nucleus accumbens, right in-
ferior OFC, right medial OFC, right gyrus rectus, right dorsal
anterior insula, and right ventral anterior insula surviving Bon-
ferroni correction (Table 2). Multivariate analysis of covari-
ance (with age, scanner, antidepressant use, antipsychotic use,
comorbid depression, and comorbid anxiety as covariates) re-
sulted in a Wilks λ of 0.707 (P = .02; partial η2 = 0.296), with
associations with right and left caudate head, right and left
nucleus accumbens, and right ventral anterior insula surviv-
ing Bonferroni correction. There were no significant differ-
encesbetweenscannersforwithin-groupROIcomparisons,nor
did results change when the scanner covariate was removed
(eFigure 1 in the Supplement).
Effective Connectivity
Sucrose anticipation and receipt elicited patterns of connectiv-
ity that were similar for 50% of identified connections across
groups.However,foroureffectiveconnectivityofinterest,there
weredifferentpatternsbetweengroupsbilaterally;thehypothala-
mus in controls directed activation to the ventral striatum,
whereas in participants with AN, the ventral striatum directed

Sucrose pleasantness was negatively correlated with PE in
all regions studied (ρ range, −0.451 to −0.249) in participants
with AN but only in the middle OFC in controls. A compari-
son of regression slopes showed significantly different slopes
between groups in the caudate head (right Fisher z, 2.103;
P < .04), medial OFC (left Fisher z, 2.204; P < .03), and nucleus
accumbens (right Fisher z, 1.958; P < .050; left Fisher z, 2.293;

group, taste pleasantness was negatively correlated with HA
(ρ, −0.294; 95% CI, −0.041 to −0.510; P < .03). In participants
with AN, ventral striatum–hypothalamus edge coefficients
were correlated with ipsilateral inferior OFC PE (right ρ, 0.318;
95% CI, 0.063 to 0.547; P < .02; left ρ, 0.354; 95% CI, 0.059

Discussion
Anorexia nervosa is a perplexing psychiatric illness, and the
complex biopsychosocial aspects of the illness have made it
difficulttodevelopbrain-basedmodelsforfoodrestriction.The
results from this study show (1) heightened caudate, nucleus
accumbens, and insula taste PE signal in adolescents with AN;
(2) ventral striatal–hypothalamic dynamic effective connec-
tivity in participants with AN that was opposite to controls and
that was positively correlated with insular and orbitofrontal
PE signal; (3) a positive correlation of cortisol level with PE in
a subset of participants; and (4) a positive correlation of OFC
PE with HA and a negative correlation of orbitofrontal and in-
sulaPEwithBMIchangeduringtreatment,asseenpreviously.22
The results suggest that the PE signal could be an important
marker for weight gain and anxiety in adolescent AN.
The first part of this study shows heightened taste reward
PE signal across the caudate, nucleus accumbens, and insula in
a large sample of adolescents and young adults with AN, com-
parablewithresultsinadults.21Starvationisassociatedwithad-
aptationsofthebodytodrivefoodintake,51-53includingchanges
in dopamine release and receptor expression.53 We expect that
inAN,theelevatedPEresponse,whichhasbeenassociatedwith
braindopamineactivity,isanadaptationtofoodrestrictionand
weight loss that normalizes with long-term recovery.54
The second major finding was a pattern of activation dur-
ing sweet taste anticipation and receipt that was directed from
the ventral striatum to the hypothalamus in AN and was posi-
tively correlated with OFC and insular PE signal. This was in
contrast to the direction of activation in controls from the hy-

was positively correlated with drive for thinness and body dis-
satisfaction. This indicates that PE values could be directly as-
sociated with HA and BMI change in AN when in the ill state,
althoughOFCPEwasnotelevatedinparticipantswithANcom-

ance between neurotransmitter systems57 and imbalance be-

portant in its association with HA. Our data also show that HA

high HA drives low taste pleasantness, making the taste expe-
rience less pleasant.
Consistent with other studies, those with AN exhibited
higher AUC for cortisol levels compared with controls,29,30
which may alter appetite regulation in AN.63 Depression scores
were not correlated with cortisol levels. The positive regres-
sion of AUC for cortisol level and PE signal in participants with
AN suggests that stress enhances PE signals.64 Prediction er-
ror acts as a learning signal and affects value-driven atten-
tional bias,65 and stress response may affect how individuals
with AN process and form associations with salient stimuli. Al-
though correlational, our data point to a model hypothesis for
further investigation: cognitive drivers in AN, such as severe

 body dissatisfaction, could increase stress hormone levels,
which both suppress eating and enhance PE signals.
Taking our data together with previous research, we pro-
pose the following model to explain the paradoxical food
restriction in AN (Figure 3): Food restriction and weight loss
are associated with sensitization of the dopamine system14
and reflected in AN by elevated PE signal, probably to stimu-
late food approach.11,12 However, PE response may increase
HA in AN because this biological mechanism to seek out
food is inconsistent with the high drive for thinness and
body dissatisfaction. Thus, there is a conflict between food
approach mechanisms (PE) and cognitive-emotional pro-
cesses that oppose eating (body dissatisfaction and drive for
thinness). Prediction error activation may then become part
of a fear-driven mechanism that includes the ventral stria-
tum to override homeostatic signals from the hypothalamus,
which would normally trigger food intake. Future studies
will have to test the validity of this model and test whether
this circuitry indeed activates or involves the previously
described fear-mediating pathway from the ventral striatum
to the hypothalamus.56
Limitations
This study has limitations. Functional magnetic resonance
imagingdoesnotdirectlymeasuredopaminergicsignaling;the
biologicallybasedcomputationalmodelusedinthisstudypro-
vides strong evidence of altered dopamine-related taste re-
ward processing in adolescent AN, but specific pharmacologi-
cal challenge studies are needed to further support this model.
The dynamic connectivity analysis included conditioned vi-
sual stimulus and unconditioned taste stimulus response; fu-
ture studies will be required to separate these over the full he-
modynamicresponsetime.Powerforthecortisollevelanalysis
was limited because we were unable to collect salivary corti-
sol samples from the entire cohort. The analysis of 20 partici-
pants with AN and 25 controls still resulted in robust, mul-
tiple comparison–corrected findings, although replication is
needed. The data were collected on 2 separate MRI scanners.
However,comparisonresultsdidnotindicatewithin-groupdif-
ferences. We did not assess learning rates; however, a subset
of the study participants showed similar learning rates across
groups in a monetary PE paradigm.22 Structural brain altera-
tions could affect brain function, but there were no differ-
ences across groups (eFigure 4 in the Supplement). The age
range up to 21 years was within child range by National Insti-
tute of Mental Health standards at the start of the study. How-
ever, there is no evidence that extending the current defini-
tion by 3 years would confound the results.
Conclusions
Prediction error brain response may have a central role in ado-
lescent AN and illness behaviors. However, longitudinal stud-
ies and neurotransmitter challenge studies are needed to fur-
ther understand how brain circuits are disrupted or altered in
AN. This will help to identify neurobiological systems that are
involved in AN pathophysiology and to develop targeted bio-
logical interventions. Another goal will be to identify demo-
graphic, behavioral, and biological variables that can predict
PE signal and can be measured without a brain scan to make
this mechanism clinically more accessible and useful.

Based on the correlational results, we
propose that weight loss is associated
with expected sensitization of the
dopamine system, reflected in
elevated PE to stimulate food
approach. However, increased PE
may elevate anxiety (harm
avoidance) in anorexia nervosa
because this is in conflict with a high
drive for thinness and body
dissatisfaction. Prediction error
activation may then become part of a
fear-driven mechanism to override
homeostatic signals from the
hypothalamus, signals that would
normally trigger eating. BMI indicates
