Objective: To assess the impact of a yoga curriculum in an elementary school on student 
quality of life, and to assess teacher and staff perception of potential barriers to, and benefits 
of, introducing yoga and mindfulness into the classroom.
Methods: A randomized controlled trial was utilized to assess the impact of a brief intervention 
on third-grade students who screened positive for symptoms of anxiety. Students were randomized 
to an intervention group of 20 students receiving small-group yoga/mindfulness activities for 8 
weeks between October 2016 and February 2017, and a control group of 32 students receiving 
care as usual. The Brief Multidimensional Students’ Life Satisfaction Scale-Peabody Treatment 
Progress Battery and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) served as outcomes. 
Teachers were invited to participate in two professional development sessions about introducing 
yoga and mindfulness into the classroom, and completed a survey following each of the sessions.
Results: In generalized estimating equation models adjusted for time, the yoga-based intervention 
was associated with a 14.17 unit increase in student emotional PedsQL (p-value 0.001) and a 7.43 
unit increase in psychosocial PedsQL (p-value 0.01). Results were not attenuated by adjustment. 
Teachers and staff reported using yoga more frequently in the classroom following the second of 
two professional development sessions (p-value <0.05). Perceived barriers to introducing yoga to the 
classroom were similar at two data collection time points, while perceived benefits remained high.
Conclusion: The intervention was associated with a significant improvement in emotional and 
psychosocial quality of life in the intervention group when compared to the control group, sug-
gesting that yoga/mindfulness interventions may improve symptoms of anxiety among students. 
Y
oga/mindfulness activities may facilitate stress management among elementary school students 
and may be added as a complement to social and emotional learning activities.

Introduction
Educational reforms and the movement toward evaluation of school performance 
through student testing have amplified psychosocial demands on children1 and increas-
ingly schools are seeking to improve social and emotional learning (SEL) programs, 
which reduce stress while addressing psychosocial development. Stress is an important 
and potentially malleable factor in the health of children,2 and school-aged children 
report having numerous stressors in their day-to-day experience, including such 
concerns as poor academic performance, peer exclusion and social pressure, being

bullied or teased,3 and homework.4,5 The stress caused by 
these day-to-day events may have an impact on children’s 
health that lasts into the future6,7 leading to anxiety and other 
health concerns. Equipping children with coping strategies 
may allow them to better deal with these stressors and prevent 
impact on future health.8,9
More than two decades of evidence support the appli-
cation of yoga and mindfulness practices for improving 
individual mental health and well-being,10 particularly for 
stress.11 Multiple systematic reviews provide evidence that 
yoga is effective at reducing anxiety and enhancing mood 
and well-being in adults. Two reviews looking at the efficacy 
of yoga interventions on stress management in adults found 
positive changes in psychological outcomes related to stress, 
but cited limitations including nonrandomized designs, small 
sample sizes, and nonstandardized yoga interventions.12,13 
Encouraging results were also found in two reviews for yoga 
as a means of addressing anxiety and anxiety disorders in 
adults,14,15 but these identified similar limitations and the 
additional limitation of heterogeneous outcomes within 
individual studies.14 
Y
oga-based interventions were also found 
to have a suggestive positive effect on depressive disorders, 
although these results were subject to similar limitations as 
those for anxiety and stress in addition to the potential lack 
of feasibility of yoga interventions for adults with limited or 
impaired mobility.16
School-based yoga and mindfulness programs have 
become widespread over the last decade in the USA17 and 
are a promising approach to improving child and adolescent 
health and well-being.18,19 Relatively short mindfulness cur-
ricula have been demonstrated to improve teacher ratings of 
student classroom behavior,20 and a systematic review and 
meta-analysis of school-based mindfulness across different 
settings recently identified strong results in improving cogni-
tive performance and resilience to stress among participating 
children.21
A recent small randomized controlled trial of mindful-
ness in school among fourth- and fifth-grade urban youth 
reported that the intervention was attractive to students, 
teachers, and school administrators and that it had a positive 
impact on problematic responses to stress including rumina-
tion, intrusive thoughts, and emotional arousal.22 Qualitative 
research has also identified perceived benefits to mindfulness 
and yoga programming including increased self-regulation, 
self-esteem, physical conditioning, academic performance, 
and stress reduction.23
A recent study of change in levels of stress among second- 
and third-grade students (as measured by salivary cortisol) 
found measurable changes following a short program of 
mindfulness yoga.24 The study authors reported the effects of a 
10-week classroom-based intervention. Students in the second 
grade, but not third grade, exhibited a decrease in cortisol level 
from before and after the intervention, while both groups of 
students showed significant decreases in cortisol level from 
before to after performance of a cognitive task. Additionally, 
teachers perceived some improvements in student behavior.24
Community partnerships with local organizations that 
deliver services to students are one way that schools may 
extend their ability to provide SEL-related activities, and may 
decrease the burden on teachers and staff to provide addi-
tional learning activities outside the required curriculum.25 
These partnerships have been utilized to reduce problem-
atic behaviors and to promote mental health and academic 
performance.26–29
The aim of the program evaluated in the present study was 
to improve the well-being of students, teachers, and staff by 
partnering an elementary school with a local social enterprise 
to incorporate dual yoga and mindfulness programming into 
the school’s existing SEL program, with a specific focus on 
students who may be experiencing stress. Mindfulness and 
yoga were added to the school’s existing empathy-based 
programming to provide additional targeted intervention for 
students identified as being in need of supplementary sup-
port. The study also sought to provide tools for teachers to 
use for all students in their classrooms on an ongoing basis. 
This study aimed to assess whether mindfulness and yoga 
instruction improved quality of life more than the usual care 
the school provided among students identified as having 
symptoms of anxiety.
Methods
A two-tiered study that included a randomized controlled trial 
of elementary school students receiving small-group yoga/
mindfulness sessions and two post-test only examinations of 
health-related quality of life for teachers and staff, after each 
of two professional development sessions, took place between 
October 2016 and February 2017 at one publicly funded 
elementary school in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA. 
Y
oga and 
mindfulness sessions were provided through a community 
organization by an experienced children’
s yoga instructor who 
provided sessions to teachers, staff, and students.
Study population
The students included in this study were third graders who 
screened positive for symptoms of anxiety, using the

Mindfulness and yoga for elementary school
(SCARED) scale30 administered at the beginning of the 2016 
academic year. Following the receipt of parental consent and 
student assent, students were randomized to an intervention 
group with 20 total students, which received the yoga and 
mindfulness intervention, or a control group with 32 stu-
dents, which received care as usual, including counseling 
and other activities, led by the school social worker. All 52 
students were given a baseline survey in which their basic 
demographics, prior experience with, and feelings about yoga 
and mindfulness, and quality of life were assessed.
Teachers and staff had two professional development ses-
sions about including yoga instruction in the classroom. They 
were surveyed following each of the professional development 
sessions. These surveys assessed teaching experience, prior 
yoga experience and attitude toward yoga and mindfulness 
activities, experience with yoga in the classroom, and teacher’
s 
quality of life. Study authors performed secondary data 
analysis on data initially gathered by the elementary school 
during an internal pilot study of their new curricular program-
ming, and provided only de-identified data to the authors. 
The protocol was submitted and approved for secondary data 
analysis by the Tulane University Institutional Review Board. 
Procedures related to consent and assent relate to the original 
data  
collection performed by the school staff and approved 
by leadership.
Student intervention
Students randomized to the intervention group participated in 
small-group yoga/mindfulness activities for 8 weeks led by a 
local social enterprise organization, using the validated 
Y
oga 
Ed curriculum and materials. Y
oga Ed is an evidence-based 
curriculum for utilizing yoga in the classroom and has been 
studied previously with children in schools.31 It includes the 
use of manualized and validated materials as the foundation 
of programs, which all meet national physical education 
and health standards, while also being uniquely designed to 
address core needs of educators and students.
Students randomized to the intervention received a total 
of 10 in-person, group sessions, each lasting 40 minutes, 
for 400 total minutes. The sessions were conducted in an 
empty classroom, before the instructional day began for the 
students. The session content included breathing exercises, 
guided relaxation, and several Vinyasa and Ashtanga poses 
appropriate for third graders.
Randomization
School staff randomized the 52 eligible students to three 
groups: a first intervention group of 10 students received 
yoga/mindfulness sessions in the fall, a second intervention 
group of 10 students received yoga/mindfulness sessions 
in the spring, and 32 students received care as usual. Ran-
domization was accomplished using instructions and tools 
provided on the open source website randomizer.org, which 
requires a standard web browser connected to the Internet.32
Teacher intervention
An introductory professional development session on includ-
ing yoga and mindfulness in the classroom was provided to 
teachers and school staff prior to the start of school year in the 
fall of 2016. All teachers and staff were invited to participate 
in an 1-hour professional development session to introduce a 
yoga and mindfulness curriculum that could be integrated into 
their classroom activities. Baseline information on teachers’ 
previous experience with, perception of, and interest in yoga/
mindfulness, as well as quality of life and indicators of stress 
were obtained by the school for the evaluation.
All teachers were offered a second professional develop-
ment session about using yoga/mindfulness in the classroom, 
building on the previous session, before the start of the second 
phase of the student intervention.
Measurements
Students
Data were collected from school students through three 
rounds. The first survey was given to students prior to ran-
domization. The midpoint survey was given after the initial 
period of the yoga/mindfulness intervention had been com-
pleted. The final survey was given following the completion 
of the intervention by all participants randomized to the 
intervention group.
The Brief Multidimensional Students’ Life Satisfac-
tion Scale-Peabody Treatment Progress Battery version 
(BMSLSS-PTPB) was used to assess student satisfaction at 
baseline, midline, and endline surveys.33–35 The BMSLSS-
PTPB is a survey tool revised from the BMSLSS. Students 
were asked six questions about their satisfaction with five 
domains of their personal lives in addition to one question 
about general satisfaction with their lives. Responses ranged 
on a five-point scale from “very dissatisfied” to “very satis-
fied”. The scores for the individual items were averaged 
together into the BMSLSS-PTPB total score, which repre-
sents overall life satisfaction, on a scale from 1 to 5, with 
higher scores indicating greater satisfaction. The psycho-
metric properties have previously been reported as robust.34
The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) was also 
used to assess student quality of life at the baseline, midline,

and endline surveys. This tool is a series of 23 questions, 
split into physical, emotional, social, and school domains.33,35 
Respondents selected how frequently they experienced a 
given problem in the previous month on a five-point Likert-
type scale, from “never” to “almost always”. The responses 
were combined into six scores, one for each of the four 
domains, in addition to an overall score and a psychosocial 
score, which represented a combination of the domains of 
emotional, social, and school problems. Possible scores 
could range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating 
lower average frequency of the problems in a given domain. 
The validity of this tool, and this method of scoring it, has 
previously been demonstrated to be high.36
Teachers/staff
Data collected from teachers included items from the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention’s Healthy Days Measures, 
which is a tool for measuring health-related quality of life.37 
Questions assessed the number of days in the prior month that 
the respondent would rate their mental health as suboptimal, 
their physical health as suboptimal, and the number of days 
on which their mental or physical health prevented them from 
completing their normal daily activities.
Analysis
The student intervention and control groups were compared 
at baseline. Intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis was performed, with 
all randomized subjects analyzed according to their assigned 
group regardless of adherence to the intervention. Differ-
ences in frequencies for categorical variables were assessed 
with Pearson’s chi-square test, except where Fisher’s exact 
test was indicated, and differences in means for continuous 
variables were assessed using t-tests. Change in PedsQL and 
BMSLSS-PTPB scores was computed at both the midline 
and endline surveys, and t-tests were performed to test for 
difference in mean change between intervention and control 
groups. Generalized estimating equations (GEEs) were used 
to model the repeated measurement of the continuous scores. 
These models allowed for assessing change in exposure status 
of the students when they received the intervention. Addi-
tionally, GEEs accommodate correlation between repeated 
measurements within individual students.38,39 The models 
were adjusted for survey time at which the outcome was 
assessed, homeroom teacher assignment, and student interest/
excitement for yoga at baseline. The p-values reported for 
GEE models are based on score tests, due to the anticonser-
vative nature of Wald statistics with small sample sizes.40,41 
Results with a p-value of <0.05 were considered statistically 
significant. SAS version 9.3 was used for all analyses (SAS 
Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Students
A comparison of the intervention and control groups is 
provided in Table 1. There were no significant differences 
between intervention and control with regard to demographic 
traits, prior yoga experience, the PedsQL score, the  
PedsQL 
subscores, or BMSLSS-PTPB score. The intervention 
group was significantly more interested in yoga, with 95% 
rating themselves very or somewhat excited to participate, 
compared to only 59.38% among the controls at baseline 
(p<0.01).
No differences existed in the baseline BMSLSS-PTPB 
or PedsQL scores between intervention and control groups 
(Table 2). Mean group scores for the psychosocial PedsQL 
and emotional PedsQL are shown in Figure 1. Groups 1 (Fall) 
and 2 (Spring) both received the intervention, while group 
3 received care as usual. All three groups saw improvement 
in psychosocial PedsQL from baseline to the midline, but 
none saw significant improvement from baseline to endline. 
Both intervention groups 1 and 2 saw net improvement in 
emotional PedsQL from baseline to endline (p<0.01), while 
there was no change in the control group.
At the midline survey, those in the intervention groups 
had a significantly larger mean improvement in emotional 
PedsQL score (17.39 for intervention compared to 0.75 for 
controls, p-value 0.005). No other changes in score were 
significantly different between intervention and control, but 
physical, psychosocial, social, and overall PedsQL change 
was higher for the intervention group than for the control 
group. At the endline survey, a similar pattern was observed. 
The difference for emotional PedsQL achieved statistical 
significance, with an 18.27 unit increase in the intervention 
group from baseline compared to a 0.86 unit decrease in the 
control group from baseline (p-value 0.009).
The results of the GEE models are shown in Table 3. 
In the model adjusted for the survey at which the outcome 
was assessed (Fall/Spring), the yoga-based intervention was 
associated with a 7.43 unit increase in student psychosocial 
PedsQL (p-value 0.01), and this association was only slightly 
attenuated and remained statistically significant following 
adjustment for homeroom assignment and baseline interest 
in yoga (p-value 0.02). Likewise, the intervention was associ-
ated with a 14.17 unit increase in student emotional PedsQL 
in the model adjusted for the survey at which the outcome 
was assessed (p-value 0.001). This was not  
attenuated by

adjustment for homeroom assignment and baseline inter-
est in yoga. Results were not statistically significant for the 
other outcomes, but in models adjusted only for survey at 
which the outcome was assessed, the yoga intervention was 
associated with nonsignificant increases in overall PedsQL 
and social PedsQL.
Teachers
The teachers were also surveyed following two professional 
development sessions on yoga and mindfulness techniques 
in the classroom held at the beginning and end of the school 
year (Table 4). Teachers were asked about a number of 
potential barriers to implementing yoga in the classroom, as 
well ways yoga might help if introduced into the classroom. 
The results from the two professional development sessions 
were similar, with teachers and staff on average identifying 
nearly six ways yoga may help in the classroom including 
helping students self-regulate, helping students be calm, 
helping the teacher be calm, or improving the classroom 
climate. Teachers on average identified fewer than two 
potential barriers to introducing yoga such as being too 
busy with academic requirements or lack of self-confidence 
using yoga techniques. The number of times per week the 
teachers reported using yoga in the classroom increased 
from 1.28 to 2.39 (p-value 0.03) between the first and second 
professional development sessions, while the mean number 
of times per day the teachers reported using yoga in the 
classroom increased from 0.76 to 1.63 times per day (p-value

0.005). The self-reported physical health of teachers was 
significantly worse at the second professional development 
session (4.15 days in the past month where physical health 
was not good at the second session compared to 1.08 at the 
first session, p-value 0.01). Other metrics of teacher health 
were not significantly different between the two professional 
development sessions.
Teachers reported feeling that yoga could be very help-
ful, with seven of the nine potential benefits exceeding 50% 
affirmative responses. The barriers most frequently cited as 
hindering the introduction of yoga into the classroom include 
being too busy with academic requirements, teacher’s lack of 
self-confidence using the techniques, and student resistance.
Discussion
The data presented indicate that students did benefit from 
this relatively short intervention, and that teachers and staff 
derived benefit as well. The students who received the inter-
vention demonstrated significantly greater improvement in 
psychosocial and emotional quality of life compared with 
their peers who received standard care. Teachers reported 
many potential benefits of using yoga in the classroom 
and also reported using yoga in the classroom more days 
each week and more times each day following the student 
intervention.
Students’ psychosocial and emotional scores increased 
as a result of participating in small-group yoga and mindful-
ness activities at school, and previous studies have not used 
the specific measures applied in this study. These findings 
are important because they provide educators with a set of 
tools that may benefit students dealing with emotional or 
psychosocial issues. The benefits highlighted in this study

Mindfulness and yoga for elementary school
and stress, and improved self-esteem in students,22,23 and 
benefited adults suffering from anxiety and depression.14–16 
The improvement in psychosocial and emotional quality of 
life may reflect similar reductions in anxiety and stress among 
the third graders included in this study.
A recent study explored children’s perceptions of stress 
and the impact of a yoga intervention on decreasing that 
stress.42 Researchers employed qualitative methods to under-
stand the experiences of urban students who attended the 
16-week program, which included yoga and mindfulness. 
Students identified changes around domains of anger, aggres-
sive behavior, and interpersonal stressors.42 A companion 
study conducted by the same authors explored teacher experi-
ences alongside the qualitative data collected from fifth- and 
sixth-grade participants in the program. Both students and 
teachers reported realistic and positive expectations related 
to the program.43
Studies that only substitute yoga for other types of physi-
cal activities as part of a physical education program may not 
adequately incorporate behavioral approaches that support 
children to adopt the practice in their day-to-day lives. One 
study found no benefit to yoga when compared to physical 
education class for reducing stress.44 The lack of significant 
differences may be due to that yoga intervention failing to 
focus on stress management and/or the stressor tasks not 
adequately capturing attenuation of stressor response, where 
physiologic endpoints were used to assess stress reactivity, 
as opposed to quality-of-life measures, as used in the pres-
ent study.
In a study conducted among fourth- and fifth-grade girls, 
White reported that mindfulness intervention was associ-
ated with a significant increase in appraisal of stress score.2 
White’s results were unanticipated, and contrasted with 
the results of the present study, may suggest some design 
issues. The prior study was composed of girls drawn from 
two schools, and randomization was performed at the school 
level, precluding any ability of the researcher to distinguish 
school-related changes in student stress from changes due 
to the intervention. Additionally, White’s study excluded 
students with prior formal yoga experience or a need for

special educational support. In effect, the study was a cluster-
randomized trial with a sample size of two (two schools), 
composed of school-aged white females without baseline 
medical or psychological diagnoses. The present study 
randomized individual students, included male and female 
children of diverse racial backgrounds, and the students were 
all determined to be at high risk for anxiety at baseline.
The present study utilized small-group yoga classes that 
were adapted to the needs of the individual students and 
their unique age group and environment. Hagen and Nayar 
presented a recent compilation of the impact of yoga on 
children’s mental well-being and note that yoga instruction 
should be tailored to the audience, multidisciplinary, and 
based on children’s needs while retaining a playful tone.45
This study has several limitations. Although the sample 
size was limited, with only 20 subjects in the intervention 
group, significant differences were identified between 
intervention and comparison groups. Additionally, the two 
intervention groups received their intervention at different 
times of the year. Student perception of their own quality of 
life may be subject to change during the course of a given 
school year, so the baseline on which the intervention was 
administered was not necessarily the same for both interven-
tion groups. The intervention evaluated combined yoga and 
mindfulness, and this study is, therefore, unable to identify 
whether one or both of these components was responsible for 
the improvements in psychosocial and emotional well-being.
This study has several strengths that deserve emphasis. 
The first is that the small-group yoga and mindfulness inter-
vention was targeted to the needs of the children who were 
participating, and likewise, the training for teachers was tai-
lored to educators of children in the local context. The subjects 
were randomly assigned to either the intervention or control 
groups, avoiding the self-selection of the exposure. The ITT 
analysis preserved the benefits of the randomization. The use 
of a previously studied yoga education curriculum allows the 
results of this study to be compared with others previously 
reported. Students’ quality of life was assessed using previ-
ously validated instruments designed for use in children. 
Finally, the data collected from teachers and staff will facilitate 
future research by helping ensure that it is tailored to address 
the concerns and suggestions of the educators.
This study demonstrated that a yoga-based interven-
tion in an educational setting can improve emotional and 
psychosocial well-being among third-grade students who 
screen positive for symptoms of anxiety. Further research 
should be conducted with diverse and larger populations, 
including additional age groups, to determine whether this 
 
improvement of quality of life remains, and whether the 
effects of yoga are applicable to a more general population of 
students. Y
oga and mindfulness curricula may provide chil-
dren at risk of anxiety with a skill enabling them to improve 
their psychosocial and emotional quality of life. These coping 
skills, when provided in the school environment, may assist 
students achieve optimum physical and mental health.
