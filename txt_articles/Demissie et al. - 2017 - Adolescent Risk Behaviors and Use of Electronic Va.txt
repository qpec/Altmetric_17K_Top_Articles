abstract
BACKGROUND: Adolescent use of tobacco in any form is unsafe; yet the use of electronic 
cigarettes and other electronic vapor products (EVPs) has increased in recent years among 
this age group. We assessed the prevalence and frequency of cigarette smoking and EVP 
use among high school students, and associations between health-risk behaviors and both 
cigarette smoking and EVP use.
METHODS: We used 2015 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey data (N = 15 624) to classify 
students into 4 mutually exclusive categories of smoking and EVP use based on 30-day use: 
nonuse, cigarette smoking only, EVP use only, and dual use. Prevalence of cigarette smoking 
and EVP use were assessed overall and by student demographics and frequency of use. 
Prevalence ratios were calculated to identify associations with health risk-behaviors.
RESULTS: In 2015, 73.5% of high school students did not smoke cigarettes or use EVPs, 3.2% 
smoked cigarettes only, 15.8% used EVPs only, and 7.5% were dual users. Frequency of 
cigarette smoking and EVP use was greater among dual users than cigarette-only smokers 
and EVP-only users. Cigarette-only smokers, EVP-only users, and dual users were more 
likely than nonusers to engage in several injury, violence, and substance use behaviors; have 
≥4 lifetime sexual partners; be currently sexually active; and drink soda ≥3 times/day. Only 
dual users were more likely than nonusers not to use a condom at last sexual intercourse.
CONCLUSIONS: EVP use, alone and concurrent with cigarette smoking, is associated with 
health-risk behaviors among high school students.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Although 
cigarette smoking among adolescents has 
decreased, the use of certain emerging tobacco 
products, such as electronic vapor products 
(EVPs), has increased. Risks, including health-risk 
behaviors, associated with EVP use have not yet 
been fully explored.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: EVP use, alone and 
concurrent with cigarette smoking, is associated 
with several health-risk behaviors among high 
school students. This suggests comprehensive 
efforts to address health-risk behaviors among 
adolescents are warranted, including prevention 
strategies focused on all forms of tobacco use.

Cigarette smoking is the leading 
cause of preventable disease and 
death in the United States. 
1 
– 
3 
Each year in the United States, an 
estimated 480 000 individuals die 
of smoking, and >3200 adolescents 
smoke their first cigarette each 
day. 
2 Data from the National Youth 
Tobacco Survey indicates that 
cigarette smoking decreased among 
high school students in the United 
States during 2011–2015.4 Similarly, 
data from the Youth Risk Behavior 
Survey (YRBS) has shown that 
cigarette smoking among this group 
is at an all-time low since 1991. 
5 
However, this success is tempered 
by the finding that use of certain 
emerging tobacco products, including 
electronic vapor products (EVPs), has 
increased. 
4 This has resulted in no 
change in overall tobacco use among 
middle and high school students. 
4
EVPs, also known as electronic 
nicotine delivery systems, 
 
6 include 
electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), 
electronic cigars, electronic pipes, 
vape pipes or pens, and electronic 
hookahs or hookah pens. EVPs 
are handheld devices that provide 
an aerosol that typically includes 
nicotine, additives, and other harmful 
and potentially harmful substances 
that are inhaled by the user. 
6 
– 
8 Data 
from the National Youth Tobacco 
Survey indicate that the percentage 
of US high school students who 
reported using an e-cigarette in the 
past 30 days increased from 1.5% to 
16.0% during 2011–2015.4
There is a range of potential 
impacts, including risks and possible 
benefits, of EVPs on patterns of use 
of cigarettes and other combustible 
tobacco products among adults. 
2 
However, among youth, any form 
of tobacco use, including EVPs, is 
unsafe. 
2 EVPs typically contain 
nicotine; nicotine exposure during 
adolescence can cause addiction, 
might harm brain development, 
and could lead to sustained tobacco 
product use. 
2, 
 
9, 
10 Furthermore, 
longitudinal studies suggest that 
youth who use EVPs are more 
likely to subsequently initiate 
cigarette smoking. 
11 
– 
13 The use of 
multiple tobacco products among 
adolescents, including EVPs, is also 
of concern because multiple tobacco 
product users have greater nicotine 
dependence than single-product 
users. 
14, 
15 Accordingly, preventing 
adolescents from initiating the use 
of any form of tobacco product, 
including EVPs, is important to 
tobacco use prevention and control 
strategies. 
16
Given that EVPs are relatively new to 
the US marketplace, little is known 
about the use of these products in 
the context of other health behaviors, 
which can persist throughout life and 
contribute to significant morbidity 
and mortality during adolescence 
and adulthood. 
5 Previous research 
on adolescent tobacco use indicates 
that cigarette smoking is associated 
with behaviors related to injury 
and violence, alcohol and drug use, 
sexual risk behaviors, physical 
activity, and school problems (ie, 
truancy). 
17 
 
 
 
 
– 
24 Additionally, research 
suggests that cigarette smoking may 
be a marker for these and other 
problem behaviors.23, 
 
25 However, the 
tobacco product landscape continues 
to diversify, and EVPs are now 
the most commonly used tobacco 
products among US high school 
students, surpassing conventional 
cigarettes in 2014. 
26 To date, studies 
on the association between EVPs 
and health-risk behaviors among 
adolescents and young adults has 
been limited to examining the 
associations between e-cigarette and 
substance use. These studies have 
found that use of e-cigarettes was 
associated with alcohol use, binge 
drinking, and marijuana use. 
12, 
 
27 
 
– 
31
Several studies have assessed 
the prevalence and reasons for 
e-cigarette use; however, none 
have examined associated health-
risk behaviors. 
13, 
 
32, 
 
33 To address 
this gap in the literature, this study 
examined the association between 
EVPs and a broad range of health-
risk behaviors among high school 
students using data from the national 
YRBS. This study also compares the 
frequency of EVP and cigarette use 
among exclusive and dual users. 
Given the considerable increases 
in EVP use and dual tobacco use 
among adolescents in recent years, 
the findings from this study could 
provide critical information to guide 
public health promotion efforts.
METHODS
Study Sample
The national YRBS monitors 6 
priority health-risk behaviors 
biennially among high school 
students. 
5 The survey uses a 3-stage 
cluster sample design to obtain a 
nationally representative sample of 
public and private school students 
in grades 9 through 12 in the 50 
states and the District of Columbia. 
Student participation is anonymous 
and voluntary, and local parental 
permission procedures are used. 
The survey is self-administered and 
students record their responses 
directly on a computer-scannable 
questionnaire or answer sheet. 
Sampling weights are applied to each 
record to adjust for nonresponse 
and the oversampling of black 
and Hispanic students. Additional 
details regarding YRBS sampling and 
psychometric properties have been 
published elsewhere. 
34, 
 
35 In 2015, the 
YRBS school response rate was 69%, 
the student response rate was 86%, 
the overall response rate was 60%, 
and the sample size was 15 624. The 
demographic distribution of the 2015 
YRBS sample has been published 
elsewhere. 
5 An institutional review 
board at the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention approved the 
national YRBS.
Measures
Cigarette Smoking and EVP Use
Current cigarette smoking and EVP 
use were assessed with the following

2 questions: “During the past 30 days, 
on how many days did you smoke 
cigarettes?” and “During the past 30 
days, on how many days did you use 
an electronic vapor product?” An 
introduction to the EVP question was 
provided to give examples of EVP 
brands (blu, NJOY, or Starbuzz) and 
examples of EVP types (e-cigarettes, 
e-cigars, e-pipes, vape pipes, vaping 
pens, e-hookahs, and hookah pens). 
Response options for both questions 
were as follows: 0 days, 1 to 2 days, 3 
to 5 days, 6 to 9 days, 10 to 19 days, 
20 to 29 days, and all 30 days. These 
questions were examined in 2 ways. 
First, each question was used in its 
original form to examine the number 
of days students smoked cigarettes 
and used EVPs (ie, frequency of 
use). Second, they were combined 
to create a 4-level variable with 
mutually exclusive categories: 
nonuse, cigarette smoking only, EVP 
use only, and dual use (cigarettes and 
EVP).
Health-Risk Behaviors
Dependent variables included those 
related to unintentional injuries and 
violence, substance use, and sexual 
risk behaviors ( 
Table 1). Variables 
in these behavioral domains 
were included in a previous YRBS 
analysis that examined associations 
between tobacco use and health-
risk behaviors. 
21 The current study 
also assessed dietary behaviors and 
physical activity ( 
Table 1). The cut 
points used for fruit and vegetable 
consumption were based on earlier 
fruit and vegetable recommendations 
that used times/day as the 
measurement unit 
36 because 
current fruit and vegetable intake 
recommendations are reported in 
cup equivalents/day, 
37 which cannot 
be calculated using YRBS data. The 
soda cutpoint was based on a study 
of Americans aged 2 years and older, 
which found that the estimated 90th 
percentile of daily energy intake from 
sugar-sweetened beverages was 
450 kcal (equivalent to three 12-oz 
cans of soda). 
38 The physical activity 
cutpoint was based on national 
recommendations. 
39
Covariates
Three demographic characteristics 
were included in this analysis: sex 
(male, female), grade (9th, 10th, 
11th, and 12th), and race/ethnicity. 
Students were classified into 4 
racial/ethnic categories: white, 
non-Hispanic; black, non-Hispanic; 
Hispanic or Latino (of any race); 
and other or multiple race. The 
numbers of students in the other or 
multiple racial/ethnic group were 
too small for meaningful analysis. 
The YRBS questionnaire includes 
questions about 2 other types of 
tobacco use. Students were also 
asked their current (past 30-day) use 
of (1) smokeless tobacco products 
(chewing tobacco, snuff, or dip) as 
well as (2) cigars, cigarillos, or little 
cigars. The response options for 
these questions were split into 2 
groups: any use and no use.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were conducted on 
weighted data using SUDAAN 
(Research Triangle Park, NC), a 
software package that accounts 
for the survey’s complex sampling 
design. The percentage of students in 
each category of the 4-level combined 
cigarette and EVP variable was 
calculated among students overall 
and by sex, race/ethnicity, and grade. 
χ2 tests were conducted to assess 
differences by demographics. Among 
cigarette users, the frequency of 
cigarette use was compared between 
cigarette-only smokers and dual 
users using pairwise comparisons 
(t statistic). In parallel, among EVP 
users, the frequency of EVP use was 
compared between EVP only and dual 
users using pairwise comparisons. 
Additionally, multivariable logistic 
regression models adjusted for sex, 
race/ethnicity, grade, smokeless 
tobacco use, and cigar smoking were 
used to estimate adjusted prevalence 
ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) for the associations 
between cigarette smoking or EVP 
use and health-risk behaviors using 
nonusers as the referent group. 
PRs were considered statistically 
significant if 95% CIs did not include 
1.0. Lastly, linear contrasts were 
conducted to compare results for all 
health-risk behaviors by cigarette 
and EVP group using other referents 
(EVP only vs cigarette only, dual use 
vs cigarette only, and dual use vs EVP 
only). Differences were considered 
significant if the P value was < .05.
RESULTS
Prevalence of Use
Nationwide, 73.5% of high school 
students did not smoke cigarettes or 
use EVPs, 3.2% smoked cigarettes 
only, 15.8% used EVPs only, and 
7.5% were dual users of both 
cigarettes and EVPs ( 
Table 2). The 
distribution across the 4-level 
cigarette and EVP use variable 
differed significantly by sex (P = .04), 
race/ethnicity (P < .001), and grade 
level (P < .001).
Frequency of Use
Dual users of cigarettes and EVPs 
were significantly less likely than 
cigarette-only smokers to smoke 
cigarettes 1 to 2 days (32.8% vs 
46.0%) but significantly more 
likely to smoke cigarettes 10 to 19 
days (10.7% vs 5.3%) and 20 to 29 
days (12.3% vs 4.1%) ( 
Fig 1). Dual 
users of cigarettes and EVPs were 
significantly less likely than EVP-only 
users to use EVPs 1 to 2 days (29.2% 
vs 55.6%), but significantly more 
likely to use EVPs 6 to 9 days (14.7% 
vs 9.1%), 10 to 19 days (15.3% vs 
7.5%), 20 to 29 days (5.8% vs 3.1%), 
and all 30 days (13.0% vs 5.3%) 
( 
Fig 2).

DEMISSIE et al 
nonusers to engage in a physical fight 
(PR range: 1.72–2.87) and attempt 
suicide (PR range: 1.86–4.01) 
( 
Table 3). Both EVP-only users 
and dual users were significantly 
more likely than nonusers to text or 
e-mail while driving (PR: 1.39 and 
1.41, respectively). Only dual users 
were significantly more likely than 
nonusers to carry a weapon (PR: 
1.82; 95% CI: 1.30–2.56).
Substance Use Behaviors
Cigarette-only smokers, EVP-
only users, and dual users were 
significantly more likely than 
nonusers to currently drink alcohol 
(PR range: 2.62–3.29), currently use 
marijuana (PR range: 3.49–5.22), 
ever use synthetic marijuana (PR 
range: 3.67–8.65), ever use other 
illicit drugs (PR range: 2.73–5.75), 
and report ever nonmedical use of 
prescription drugs (PR range: 2.30–
4.13) ( 
Table 3).
Sexual Risk Behaviors
Cigarette-only smokers, EVP-
only users, and dual users were 
significantly more likely than 
nonusers to have ≥4 lifetime 
partners (PR range: 2.35–4.60) and 
be currently sexually active (PR

range: 1.86–2.30) ( 
Table 3). Only 
dual users were significantly more 
likely than nonusers not to use a 
condom at last sexual intercourse 
(PR: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.07–1.50).
Dietary Behaviors and Physical Activity
Dual users were significantly less 
likely to eat vegetables <3 times 
per day compared with nonusers 
(PR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.91–0.98) 
( 
Table 3). Cigarette-only smokers, 
EVP-only users, and dual users 
were significantly more likely than 
nonusers to drink soda ≥3 times/
day (PR range: 1.35–3.03). EVP-
only users were significantly less 
likely not to engage in daily physical 
activity compared with nonusers (PR: 
0.91; 95% CI: 0.88–0.95).
Linear Contrasts
Engaging in health-risk behaviors 
did not generally differ between 
EVP-only users and cigarette-
only smokers ( 
Table 3); however, 
cigarette-only smokers were 
significantly more likely than EVP-
only users to attempt suicide, ever 
use synthetic marijuana, have ≥4 
lifetime sexual partners, drink soda 
≥3 times/day, and be physically 
active <7 days in the 7 days before 
the survey. When comparing dual 
users to cigarette-only smokers, 
dual users were significantly more 
likely than cigarette-only smokers 
to engage in all substance use 
behaviors and physical fighting. 
When comparing dual users to EVP-
only users, significant differences 
were observed for all substance use 
and sexual risk behaviors, physical 
fighting, attempted suicide, soda 
intake, and physical activity. In all 
cases, dual users were more likely to 
engage in these behaviors compared 
with EVP-only users.
DISCUSSION
The findings of this study are 
consistent with other studies 
documenting an association between 
EVP use, particularly e-cigarettes, 
and other substance use. 
12, 
 
27 
 
– 
31 
However, this study also shows 
that EVP use is associated with 
other health-risk behaviors. For a 
majority of the behaviors examined 
in this study, cigarette-only 
smokers and EVP-only users were 
as likely to engage in that behavior, 
suggesting that the associations 
between health-risk behaviors and 
EVP use mirror the associations 
between health-risk behaviors and 
conventional cigarettes. The pattern 
of cigarette-only and EVP-only users 
having intermediate risks between 
nonusers and dual users is consistent 
with other published studies. 
29, 
 
30 
Consequently, addressing the 
diversity of tobacco use as part of 
youth health promotion efforts is 
important.

Research on conventional cigarettes 
suggests that smoking occurs along 
with, or clusters with, various 
health-risk behaviors and that 
cigarette smoking may serve as a 
marker for these behaviors.

This is important to consider in the 
context of public health practice 
because research indicates that 
among adults, the odds of reporting 
fair or poor health status increase 
with each unhealthy behavior that 
an individual engages in.40 The 
development of certain unhealthy 
behaviors during adolescence puts 
adolescents on trajectories toward 
chronic disease. 
25 The reason for the 
association between tobacco use and 
other health-risk behaviors may be 
due to common factors (ie, lack of 
resources such as health education), 
motivation by similar goals (ie, 
rejecting conventional social norms), 
or the activation of similar neural 
pathways. 
24, 
 
25, 
 
41 Cigarette smoking 
has also been found to be associated 
with emotional and behavioral 
problems, which could also make 
adolescents more vulnerable 
to developing other health-risk 
behaviors.42, 
 
43 Future studies may 
show similar vulnerabilities among 
EVP users, including whether 
e-cigarette use may be introducing 
youth with relatively low-risk 
profiles to substance use. Therefore, 
comprehensive efforts to address 
the health-risk behaviors among 
adolescents are warranted, including 
prevention strategies focused 
on all forms of tobacco use, including 
EVPs.
Despite the harms of EVP use 
among adolescents, use of these 
products among US middle and 
high school students has increased 
considerably in recent years, for 
several possible reasons. First, in 
2014, 18 million youth were exposed 
to e-cigarette advertising. 
44 Given 
the link between marketing of 
conventional tobacco products and 
tobacco initiation among youth, it is 
likely that increases in e-cigarette 
marketing are contributing to 
increases in EVP use. 
44 Second, the 
flavorings frequently used in EVPs 
are appealing to adolescents. 
6, 
 
8, 
45 
Third, use of EVPs may be considered 
more socially acceptable, particularly 
in indoor areas where conventional 
cigarette smoking is prohibited. 
6 
Fourth, EVPs have been relatively 
easy for youth to access; they are 
available in retail stores, mall kiosks, 
and the Internet. 
6, 
 
46 However, efforts 
are underway to reduce potential 
public harms of these products 
through regulation. In May 2016, the 
US Food and Drug Administration 
finalized a rule extending its 
authority to all products that meet 
the definition of a tobacco product, 
including e-cigarettes. E-cigarettes 
are considered a tobacco product due 
to a 2011 court ruling. 
47 The 2016 
rule sets a national minimum age 
for sales, requires tobacco product 
ingredient reporting and reporting 
of harmful and potentially harmful 
constituents, and ensures Food and 
Drug Administration premarket 
review of new and changed tobacco 
products.48
This study found that dual users 
smoked cigarettes more frequently 
than cigarette-only smokers and used 
EVPs more frequently than EVP-only 
users. These findings are consistent 
with research showing that among 
US adolescents who ever smoked 
cigarettes, e-cigarette users were less 
likely than nonusers to abstain from 
cigarettes. 
49 Additionally, a study of 
Polish adolescents found that dual 
users of electronic and conventional 
cigarettes were more likely to smoke 
cigarettes daily and less likely to 
smoke fewer cigarettes per day than 
students who exclusively smoked 
conventional cigarettes. 
50 This lack 
of decline in smoking frequency 
among youth e-cigarette users is 
contrary to studies showing that EVP 
use may reduce cigarette smoking 
frequency among adults. 
51 These 
findings underscore the importance 
of evidence-based measures to 
prevent use of all forms of tobacco 
use, including experimental or 
intermittent use, among youth. 
52 
Studies have shown that symptoms of 
tobacco dependence are evident even 
among adolescents who used only 
a single tobacco product on as few 
as 1 to 2 days during the previous 
month.15
In addition to population-based 
interventions, such as youth access 
restrictions and comprehensive 
smoke-free policies that include

EVPs, 
 
53 actions can also be taken in 
the clinical setting to address youth 
tobacco use. Screening of patients 
and their caregivers for EVP use can 
be incorporated into tobacco use 
screening. 
6 Counseling about the 
harms associated with adolescent 
tobacco use, including EVP use, is 
critical. 
6 It is particularly important 
that this counseling identify and 
correct misperceptions about 
the use of EVP products in this 
population. 
40
This study has at least 4 limitations. 
First, YRBS data are self-reported, 
and students may misreport their 
behaviors. Although the EVP question 
is new to YRBS, a psychometric 
study has shown that the YRBS 
questions generally have good 
test-retest reliability. 
34 Second, 
the data are from an observational 
study; therefore, causality cannot 
be determined. Third, some of the 
behaviors investigated may not 
be risky for particular individuals 
under certain circumstances. For 
example, sexual intercourse without 
a condom may not be risky for 
mutually monogamous partners 
when another contraceptive method 
is used. Lastly, data are only collected 
on adolescents who attend school 
and therefore are not representative 
of all individuals in this age group. 
However, nationwide in 2012, ∼3% 
of persons aged 16 to 17 years 
were not enrolled in a high school 
program and had not completed high 
school. 
54
CONCLUSIONS
EVP use, alone and concurrent with 
cigarette smoking, is associated 
with health-risk behaviors among 
high school students. Moreover, 
dual users of EVPs and conventional
