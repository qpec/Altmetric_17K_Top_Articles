T cells are known to be plastic and to change their phenotype according to the cellular 
and biochemical milieu they are embedded in. In this study, we transposed this con-
cept at a macroscopic level assessing whether changes in the environmental housing 
conditions of C57/BL6 mice would influence the phenotype and function of T cells. Our 
study shows that exposure to 2 weeks in an enriched environment (EE) does not impact 
the T cell repertoire in vivo and causes no changes in the early TCR-driven activation 
events of these cells. Surprisingly, however, T cells from enriched mice showed a unique 
T helper effector cell phenotype upon differentiation in vitro. This was featured by a 
significant reduction in their ability to produce IFN-γ and by an increased release of IL-10 
and IL-17. Microarray analysis of these cells also revealed a unique gene fingerprint 
with key signaling pathways involved in autoimmunity being modulated. Together, our 
results provide first evidence for a specific effect of EE on T cell differentiation and its 
associated changes in gene expression profile. In addition, our study sheds new light on 
the possible mechanisms by which changes in environmental factors can significantly 
influence the immune response of the host and favor the resolution of the inflammatory 
response.

Over the past decade, a growing body of research has identified that many immune cells are able to 
dynamically alter their form and function in response to changes in the local microenvironment. 
Such functional and phenotypic plasticity has been observed in cells of both the innate (1–3) and 
adaptive (4–7) immune system. In the context of the adaptive immune response, an ever-growing 
number of studies have investigated the experimental conditions (such as skewing cytokines, 
antigen-presenting cells, or receptor co-stimulation) that favor the differentiation of T cells into 
a specific effector T helper (Th) type. One such example is the multitude of in vitro and in vivo 
studies on Th17 cells, a differentiated and apparently fully committed Th cell phenotype, which has 
been shown to switch between a pathogenic, inflammatory and protective, regulatory functions (and 
vice versa) in accordance with the conditions in which they are cultured (8–11).
While the concept of immune cell mutability in response to the specific tissue and cellular sur-
rounding has been widely explored in vitro (12, 13), little is known about the influence of the external 
“de-corpore” (trans. Out of the body) environmental factors. This is surprising considering that a

great deal of literature suggests that after genetics, factors such as 
pollution (14–16), geographical location (17, 18), psychological 
state (19–22), and social status (23–26) are each key determinants 
in the etiology of autoimmune disorders.
Aiming to understand how these environmental factors 
modulate the immune response, we decided to investigate the 
effect of a well-established experimental paradigm – the enriched 
environment (EE) (27, 28) – on T cell function. Initially described 
by Donald Hebb [for an extensive historical and scientific review 
on the topic, see Ref. (29)], EE uses one or more altered housing 
conditions to provide an “enriched” sensory, physical, and/or 
social environment for an animal. Such enrichment materials can 
include tunnels, wheels, ladders, and further enclosed apparatus 
that together provide a richer, “multisensorial” standard of living 
compared to a classical lab enclosure.
Studies on the biological effects of environmental enrichment 
have identified a number of beneficial effects on a variety of 
physiological parameters, including neuronal growth and devel-
opment, vascular inflammation, and metabolic syndromes (27, 
28, 30). Strikingly, in the majority of these studies, such beneficial 
effects are demonstrated by an improved capability to recover 
from experimental pathologies, such as trauma (31), cellular 
degeneration (32–40), and neoplasms (41, 42). This suggests an 
improved capacity for healing to be a common denominator for 
the potential therapeutic effects of an EE. Interestingly, several 
studies have shown that immune activation is often paramount 
to an efficient healing process (43, 44).
Our results show that a period as short as 2 weeks of housing 
in an EE causes significant changes to the gene expression profile 
of T cells as well as their effector function, shifting their profiles 
from a classical Th1 phenotype toward a more intermediate state 
featured by a reduction in IFN-γ and an increase in IL-10 and 
IL-17 production. These results provide the first evidence of 
epigenetic changes induced by EE in T cells while also providing 
clues about their possible contribution to a faster resolution of 
immune and inflammatory diseases.
MaTerials anD MeThODs
Mice
For all the experiments, we used 6-week-old C57BL/6 male mice 
purchased from Charles River. Mice were housed in groups of 
maximum six animals per cage under specific pathogen-free 
conditions and with free access to food and water. Mice were 
housed for at least 7 days prior to testing. All tests were con-
ducted in a blinded fashion and according to the UK Animals 
Scientific Procedures Act, 1986. The local biological service unit 
at Queen Mary University of London approved all experimental 
protocols.
enriched environment normal 
environment
Mice (five per cage) were housed either in normal environment 
(NE) or EE for 2 weeks according to Sztainberg and Chen (45) with 
some modifications. Briefly, NE consisted of a standard mouse 
cage (W × D × H – 40 cm × 16.5 cm × 17.4 cm) filled with 2–3 cm 
of sawdust and nesting material (paper strips); EE consisted of a 
wider cage (W × D × H – 40 cm × 25 cm × 20 cm) containing 
wood shavings in addition to sawdust and different nesting mate-
rials and toys. More specifically, one colored transparent plastic 
nest-box (Superpet Puzzle Playground; Superpet; Amazon UK), 
one fabric tube (Small Crinkle Activity Tunnel, Amazon UK), one 
running wheel (Kaytee/Superpet Silent Spinner, 4.5-inch, Mini; 
Amazon, UK), and one wood hamster swing (Trixie Hamster 
Wood Seesaw Toy, Amazon, UK). The toys were changed after 
1 week and replaced with new ones. The weight of the mice was 
recorded every other day for 2 weeks.

populations. Data shown are from a single mouse and representative of n = 4 separate experiments with five mice per each group.

Behavioral Tests: Open Field and  
Marble-Burying Tests
If not otherwise stated, tests were performed double-blind every 
other day during the light phase of the light–dark cycle, as previ-
ously described and recommended (46). All the efforts were made 
to minimize mouse discomfort in these behavioral experiments. 
Mice were brought to the testing room at least 30 min before the 
start of the test session to allow habituation to the testing envi-
ronment. Unless otherwise specified, standard lighting (about 
50 lux) and quiet conditions were maintained throughout each 
experiment. The open field test (OFT) is an ethologically based 
paradigm that provides objective measures of exploratory behav-
ior as well as a valid initial screen for anxiety-related behavior in 
rodents and was carried out as previously described. The appa-
ratus consisted of a white PVC arena (50 cm × 30 cm × 20 cm) 
divided into 10 cm × 10 cm squares (n = 15). The three central 
squares defined the “center” region. Each mouse was placed in 
a corner square, facing the wall, and observed and recorded for 
3 min. The total number of squares crossed (all four paws in), 
total number of rears (defined as both front paws off the ground, 
but not as a part of grooming), and number of center crossings 
was recorded. The walls and floor of the arena were thoroughly 
cleaned between each trial. The marble-burying test (MBT) is 
thought to reflect repetitive and perseverative behavior, possibly 
related to compulsions and/or anxiety disorders (47). The test was 
carried out as described by Deacon and colleagues (48) with some 
modifications. Briefly, mice were individually placed in a clear 
plastic box (14 cm × 10 cm × 11 cm) filled with ~5-cm depth 
of wood chip bedding lightly pressed to give a flat surface (see 
Figure 1). Fifteen 1.5-cm diameter glass marbles were placed on 
the surface, evenly spaced, each about 4 cm apart, so to form 5 
rows of 3. The latency to start digging (defined as the mouse dig-
ging the bedding with front and hind paws for more than 1 s), the 
total number of digging bouts, and the number of buried marbles 
(to two-third of their depth) were manually recorded during the 
10-min test.
Flow cytometric analysis
Lymphocytes from thymus, lymph nodes, or spleen were stained 
in 100 μl of FACS buffer (PBS containing 5% FCS and 0.02% of 
NaN2). The antibodies used were anti-CD3 PE (clone 145-2C11, 
eBioscience), anti-CD4 FITC (clone GK 1.5, eBioscience), anti-
CD8 Cy5 (clone 53-6.7, eBioscience), anti-CD25 FITC (clone 
PC61, BioLegend), and anti-CD69 PE (clone H1.2F3, eBiosci-
ence). Cells were labeled with the appropriate concentration of 
conjugated antibodies for 1 h at 4°C as previously described (49). 
After labeling, cells were washed and analyzed. Cells were first 
gated for singlets (FSC-H vs. FSC-A) and lymphocytes (SSC-A 
vs. FSC-A). The lymphocyte gate was further analyzed for their 
expression of CD3, CD4, or CD8. In all the experiments, stained 
cells were acquired with FACScalibur flow cytometer and analyzed 
using FlowJo™ software (Tree Star, Inc., Oregon Corporation).
cell Treatment and cytokine Measurement
Freshly isolated lymphocytes were seeded in the same num-
ber with or w/o plate-bound anti-CD3/28 antibodies in the

concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. After an overnight incubation at 37°C, 
cells were stained for FACS analysis, supernatants were collected, 
and cytokine levels were measured. For the skewing experiments, 
cells were cultured in Th1 conditions as previously described 
(50). Briefly, cells were stimulated with plate-bound anti-CD3/28 
antibodies in the concentration of 1 μg/ml in the presence of IL-2 
(10 ng/ml), IL-12 (3.4 ng/ml), and anti-IL-4 (2 μg/ml). In some 
experiments, cells were skewed in Th2 [IL-4 (10 ng/ml); IL-2 
(10 ng/ml); anti-INFγ (2 μg/ml)] or Th17 [IL-6 (10 ng/ml); anti-
IL-4 (2 μg/ml); anti-INFγ (2 μg/ml); TGF-β (5 ng/ml)] as previ-
ously described (51). After 72-h incubation at 37°C, supernatants 
were collected, and cytokine levels were measured. Cytokine levels 
were measured on undiluted supernatant using the Mouse Th1/
Th2/Th17/Th22 16plex Kit Flowcytomix and according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions (eBioscience). For the intracellular 
staining, differentiated cells were stimulated with concanavalin-A 
(ConA, 5 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, England) in the presence 
of protein transport inhibitor brefeldin-A (1:1000; eBioscience) 
for 4 h. Con-A1 stimulated cells were pelleted, stained for CD4 
(1:500) for 30 min, and fixed with 1% PFA for 10 min. Finally, 
cells were permeabilized and stained for 30 min in permeabiliza-
tion buffer (composed by 0.1% saponin and 0.09% NaN2 in PBS, 
eBioscience, Hatfield, UK) containing conjugated antibodies 
(dil: 1:250) against IFNγ (clone XMG1.2, eBioscience) and IL-17 
(eBioTC11-18H10.1, eBioscience). Labeled cells were washed, 
resuspended in FACS buffer containing 1% PFA, and analyzed by 
FACScalibur. Acquired data were analyzed by FlowJo™ software 
(Tree Star, Inc., Oregon Corporation).
corticosterone Measurement
Corticosterone concentrations were measured in diluted (1:32) 
plasma by EIA assay following the manufacturer’s instructions 
(Enzo Life Sciences).
Microarray analysis and Bioinformatics
Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy® Microarray Tissue 
Mini Kit (Qiagen®, West Sussex, UK), and the labeled DNA 
was hybridized to Affymetrix MoGene1_0-st Gene Arrays 
(transcript version). Computational analysis was performed 
using Mac OS 10.6.8, and R version 3.1.0. affymetrix plat-
form MoGene_1.0st transcript cluster Microarray data 
were normalized by rma of the Bioconductor package, affy. 
Differentially expressed genes (DEG) were identified by the 
Bioconductor package limma. Heatmap was generated by 
the function heatmap.2 of the CRAN package, gplots, using 
the complete-linkage clustering using the Euclidean distance. 
Pathway analysis was performed by a signaling pathway impact 
analysis, using the Bioconductor package, SPIA. Briefly, SPIA 
tests both the enrichment of genes in each pathway and the 
impact of the DEG on the signaling cascade, considering its 
topology (network) using a bootstrapping procedure of genes 
(B = 2000). These two tests generate two probability values, 
which are combined to generate a global probability, PG, and 
PG < 0.05 was considered significant. In other words, pathways 
with a significant probability value by SPIA are considered 
significantly perturbed (52).

RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer’s pro-
tocol and reverse transcribed using 2-μg oligo(dT)15 primer, 10 
units AMV reverse transcriptase, 40 units RNase inhibitor (all 
from Promega, Southampton, UK), and 1.25 mM each dNTP 
(Bioline, London, UK) for 45 min at 42°C. Real-time PCR 
was carried out using TaqMan Universal PCR master mix and 
fluorescent primers obtained from Quiagen (QuantiTect prim-
ers). Cycling conditions were set according to manufacturer’s 
instructions. Sequence-specific fluorescent signal was detected 
by an ABI Prism 7700Sequence Detector System. mRNA data 
were normalized relative to GADPH and then used to calculate 
expression levels. We used the comparative Ct method (53) 
to measure the gene transcription in samples. The results are 
expressed as relative units based on calculation of 2 − ΔΔCt, 
which gives the relative amount of gene normalized to endog-
enous control (GADPH) and to the sample with the lowest 
expression set as one.
Data analysis
Pairwise comparisons were made by t-test, while comparisons 
of more than two groups were analyzed using one-way ANOVA. 
Statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05, and all data are pre-
sented as mean ± SEM.
resUlTs
environmental enrichment Does not 
cause gross changes to the T cell 
repertoire
Previous studies employing an EE have used a wide range of 
exposure times varying from hours to weeks (54–58). In this 
study, we used a 2-week EE protocol based on preliminary stud-
ies aimed at assessing the minimum time needed to see changes 
in T cell differentiation (data not shown) and based on previous 
investigations showing stable changes in the gene expression pro-
file of the brain at this time point (58). At the end of the 2 weeks 
of enrichment or standard housing, mice were either subjected 
to behavioral and biochemical tests or assessed for their immune 
repertoire (see scheme in Figure 1).
We first tested the possible effects of EE on the overall T cell 
repertoire in vivo looking at the CD3, CD4, or CD8 profile in the 
thymus and lymph nodes. There were no significant differences 
in the total cell number of either thymocytes or lymph node cells 
(Figures 2A,B, left panels, respectively). Flow cytometric analysis 
showed a small but non-significant increase (~5–10%) in relative 
percentages and number of CD3+ cells from EE compared to NE 
mice in both thymus and lymph nodes (Figures 2A,B, middle 
panels, respectively). Similarly, no differences in the ratio of

CD4+ vs. CD8+ cell were found between groups (Figures 2A,B, 
right panels, respectively).
We continued this overall assessment of the effect of 2 weeks of 
EE by measuring its influence on anxiety-like behavior. Analysis 
of plasma corticosterone revealed levels of the hormone to be 
slightly lower (non-significant) in the EE group compared to 
NE (Figure 3A). Consistent with these results, we found no sig-
nificant differences in anxiety-like behavior as evaluated by two 
separate assessors: the open field and MBT. Indeed, the number 
of central entries [directly proportional to a reduced state of 
anxiety-like behavior (59)] and the overall horizontal activity 
(evaluated by the number of squares crossed) of NE and EE mice 
in the OFT were comparable (Figure 3B, top left and right panel, 
respectively). Similarly, in the MBT, the number of buried mar-
ble or digging bouts (both parameters of increased anxiety-like 
behavior) showed no significant differences (Figure 3B, bottom 
left and right panel, respectively).
effect of environmental enrichment on the 
early T cell activation events
To investigate the effects of EE on the early T cell activation 
events, we stimulated T cells from NE and EE mice with plate-
bound anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 antibodies (anti-CD3/CD28) 
and measured CD25 and CD69 expression on the cells and IL-2 
production in the supernatant. As shown in Figure 4, no signifi-
cant difference in IL-2 production across EE and NE mice groups 
were noted (Figure 4A). Neither the relative levels of CD25 and 
CD69 expression nor the percentage of CD25+ and CD69+ cells 
showed significant differences (Figure 4B).
To further explore possible differences in the activation 
phenotype of NE and EE T cells, we measured the levels of other 
classical inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-10, IL-17, 
and GM-CSF) produced after 24 h of culture. As shown in 
Figure 5, there were no significant differences in the levels of all 
the cytokines produced except for IFN-γ that was significantly 
lower (~2×) in EE compared to NE (p < 0.05; Figure 5, bottom 
right panel).
effect of environmental enrichment on 
effector T helper cell Differentiation
The reduced production of IFN-γ in the 24-h poststimulation 
culture suggested the possible influence of EE on Th1 differen-
tiation. To further test this hypothesis, we cultured NE and EE 
T cells for 72 h in Th1 skewing conditions. Multiplex analysis of 
cell supernatants of Th1 cells, restimulated overnight with anti-
CD3, revealed distinct differential cytokine expression patterns 
 FigUre 6 | effect of 2 weeks ee on Th effector cell cytokine production in vitro. The top and the middle panels show the levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-17, 
GM-CSF, and IFN-γ in the supernatants of NE and EE T cells differentiated in Th1 skewing conditions for 4 days and then stimulated with 0.5 μg/ml of plate-bound 
anti-CD3/CD28 for 24 h. Data shown means ± SEM from n = 5 mice and representative of n = 3 separate experiments with similar results. *p > 0.05; **p > 0.01; 
***p > 0.001. The bottom panels show the level of expression of Tbx21, Foxp3, and Rorc in the same cells. Data are expressed as fold increase of EE cells over NE 
cells. Values are means ± SEM from n = 5 mice and representative of n = 2 separate experiments with similar results.

between EE and NE. EE T cells released significantly lower levels 
of IFN-γ while producing higher levels of IL-10 and IL-17 com-
pared to NE (Figure 6, bottom right, top right, and bottom left, 
respectively). FACS intracellular staining of permeabilized cells 
pellets confirmed these results showing an increased percentage 
of IL-17+ cells and decrease in IFN-γ+ (Figure 7). No significant 
differences were observed in cells cultured in Th2 or Th17 skew-
ing conditions (data not shown).
cD4 gene Fingerprint of enriched  
and non-enriched Mice
To gain further insight on the possible molecular mechanisms 
by which EE influenced the differentiation ex vivo of Th1 effector 
cells, we assessed the gene expression profile of anti-CD3/CD28-
stimulated EE CD4+ T cells compared to their NE controls. The 
flowchart in Figure 8A summarizes the outcome of this analysis. 
From the 34,760 probes present on the chip, 61 were significantly 
modulated (p < 0.05). This corresponded to 61 DEG with a fold 
change (FC) value <0.5 or >2, 56 of which were upregulated and 
5 downregulated. The complete list of DEG has been reported in 
Table S1 in Supplementary Material. RT-PCR for a selection of 
DEG genes (see Discussion) confirmed the results of the microar-
ray (Figure 9).
Of these upregulated genes, a large number were identified 
as related to T cell activation and survival. Pathway analysis 
of these DEGs (listed in Table S2 in Supplementary Material) 
clustered them around four main categories: chemokine signal-
ing pathways (Figure S1 in Supplementary Material), cytokine–
cytokine receptor interaction (Figure S2 in Supplementary 
Material), protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER) (Figure S3 in Supplementary Material), and transcrip-
tional misregulators in cancer (Figure S4 in Supplementary 
Material).

DiscUssiOn
Enriched Environment is a popular tool in the field of neurobiol-
ogy that has been long used to demonstrate the modulatory effect 
that the external environment can have on the brain and nervous 
system at both the functional and phenotypic level (60). In this 
study, we reveal that EE has similar modulatory effects in the 
murine immune system. More specifically, our systematic analy-
sis of T cells – in vivo and in vitro – provides the first evidence by 
which EE influences the functions of these cells.
Starting from a very general comparison of the T cell immune 
repertoire in vivo, we found no readily visible or measurable dif-
ference between NE and EE mice. Indeed, looking at the T cell 
repertoire in both primary and secondary lymphoid organs 
(thymus and lymph nodes), there were no significant differences 
in terms of the overall number or the ratio between CD4 and 
CD8 cells.
Still considering any possible effect of EE in vivo, when 
we tested EE mice for possible changes in their basal state of 
anxiety-like behavior, we found no significant changes in cor-
ticosterone levels or in their behavioral responses in the open 
field or MBTs. This was surprising considering that EE has been 
proposed to significantly improve the health and welfare of 
experimental animals (61). Yet, there are a number of studies 
that suggest the possible changes in the emotional status of mice 
might not be “measurable” through classical behavioral tests or 
corticosterone levels (62, 63). This is especially true when the 
treatment applied is administered over a long period of time. One 
explanation for this paradox is that both behavioral responses 
and corticosterone levels are physiological measurements of 
“novel” and transitory changes of the external environment. 
These biological responses level off upon habituation as it has 
been previously reported (64).
However, our analyses of in vitro T cell responses provided 
a completely different picture. As discussed later, we performed 
this set of experiments to specifically rule out any “confounding” 
factors that could be present in vivo and ultimately influence T cell 
function. When we looked at the early TCR-driven activation 
events, we found no significant differences in the levels of expres-
sion of activation markers CD25 and CD69 or in the production 
of the proliferative cytokine IL-2. These results are consistent with 
other studies where no significant changes in T cell activation

were observed and suggested to us that EE might not have a role 
in regulating these early signaling pathways (65).
Moving into exploring if EE would influence the effector phase 
of T cell life, we investigated differences in the levels of inflamma-
tory cytokines (other than IL-2), in the cell supernatants of T cells 
stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 for 24 or 48 h. At this stage, 
 
T cells are considered in Th0 state (66, 67) and not biased toward 
any of the known effector phenotypes, such as Th1, Th2, Th17, or 
Th-GM-CSF. Similar to a previous study, we found that EE T cells 
produced a significantly lower level of Th1 landmark cytokine 
IFN-γ, while none of the other Th-specific lead cytokines (IL-4 
for Th2, IL-17 for Th17, GM-CSF for Th-GM-CSF, or IL-10 for 
Treg) showed any significant difference.
To further investigate this possibly specific effect of EE on Th1 
skewing, we differentiated EE T cells in Th1 conditions, assess-
ing their cytokine profile upon restimulation with anti-CD3. 
The results confirmed our previous observation on the reduced 
production of IFN-γ, this time with a much greater degree of 
inhibition (60% vs. 40%). Most interestingly, we observed a very 
unique pattern of cytokine production with EE cells releasing 
significantly higher levels of IL-10 and IL-17 compared to control.
Recent intriguing studies in the field of Th cell plasticity have 
identified a new type of Th cells that produce low level of INF-γ 
but higher levels of IL-17 and IL-10. These have been identified 
in vivo using IL-17A fate reporter mouse [IL-17ACRE × Rosa26 
STOPfl/fl YFP (R26YFP)] crossed with IL-17A IL-10eGFP 
Foxp3RFP triple reporter mouse (68). Using models of self-
limiting (administration of anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody) or 
non-resolving (DNIL-10R transgenic mice with an impairment 
of IL-10R signaling in CD4 T cells) inflammation, the authors of 
this study have shown that these IL-10 producing Th17 lympho-
cytes, also known as T-regulatory 17 (Treg-17) cells, represent a 
specific stage of the “plastic life” of T cells. Unlike Th17 cells that 
are regarded as a pathogenic and pro-inflammatory (69), Treg-17 
cells have been shown to play a protective and immunosuppres-
sive function, in part through their production of IL-10 (70, 71). 
Based on this evidence, it is tempting to speculate that the positive 
and “therapeutic effects” of EE are due to their ability to favor the 
development of Treg-17 cells.
Aiming to gain insight on the mechanisms by which EE could 
favor the production of this unique pattern of cytokines in vitro, 
we decided to perform a microarray analysis of EE CD4+ T cells 
activated with anti-CD3/CD28. The results showed a number of 
interesting hits that supported the concept of a gene program 
favoring a Th2/T-regulatory phenotype. In addition, of the most 
significantly unregulated genes, a large number were identified as 
T cell survival factors. Notable upregulated genes included SOCS3 
a member of the suppressor of cytokine signaling family that 
regulates CD8+ T cell proliferation through inhibition of IL-6 
and IL-27 (72). Fos-related antigen 2 (FOSL2), a transcription 
factor preferentially expressed during the early phase of Th2 cell 
proliferation, was also upregulated (73). As was insulin receptor 
substrate 2 (IRS-2), a cytoplasmic signaling molecule shown to 
play a key role in IL-4 induced T cell proliferation (74).
Several regulators of CD4+ CD25− T cell and T regulatory cell 
(T-Reg) differentiation were also identified as significantly upreg-
ulated in the enriched group. Nr4a2 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 
4, Group A, Member 2) codes NURR1 (Nuclear receptor related 
1 protein), an intracellular transcription factor demonstrated to 
promote generation of regulatory T cell types through induction 
of Foxp3, a transcription factor commonly regarded as a master 
regulator of T-Reg function and development (75). The protein 
Tribbles 1, coded by Trib1, also acts upon Foxp3 co-binding with 
the transcription factor to enhance its T-Reg promoting function 
(76). In addition, Kruppel-like Transcription Factor 10, coded by 
Klf10 has been shown to play an important role in the suppres-
sor function of both CD4+ CD25− T cells and T-Regs through 
transactivation of the TGF-β1 and Foxp3 promoters (77).
Aiming to gain more insights out of our gene expression 
screening, we performed pathway analysis of EE-induced DEGs. 
We found striking changes in both cytokine signaling cascades 
and responses to chemokines. This is interesting considering 
that a cytokine/chemokine-driven feedback loop determines for 
the observed differential infiltration of Th1 and Th17 cells into 
inflamed tissues and organs (78). Perhaps, more surprisingly, 
the analysis showed activation of ER stress in EE T cells. Similar 
to inflammation (and tightly linked to it) ER stress has been 
shown to have both a positive and negative effect on the immune 
response. Indeed, although it is clear that severe ER stress can 
promote inflammation and autoimmunity, several recent stud-
ies have also shown that low levels of ER stress may actually be 
beneficial. ER stress promotes “an adaptive Unfolded Protein 
Response (UPR) that preconditions the cell to a subsequent lethal 
insult: a process now known as ER hormesis” (79). Accordingly, 
one might hypothesize that the action of EE is to provide a state 
of preconditioning that confers the host the ability to better face 
pathogenic or harmful challenges.
In conclusion, the key findings of this study are that a simple 
set of alterations to the external environment for period of time, 
as brief as 2 weeks, can dramatically alter the immune profile of T 
cells making them more prone to acquire a protective inflamma-
tory phenotype. A current limitation of this study is that we have 
not investigated the occurrence of these cells in vivo in relevant 
disease conditions, such as in mouse models of autoimmune dis-
eases, although there are already studies in the literature showing 
for instance therapeutic effect of EE in mouse models of multiple 
sclerosis (80, 81). We have purposefully not done so for two main 
reasons. First, we wanted to assess if the EE could induce stable 
changes in the gene expression profile of T cells that would be 
maintained ex vivo. Second, we wished to rule out the potentially 
confounding influence of the in vivo milieu on the fate of T cells 
and thus obtain a more controlled comparison between NE and 
EE (82). Studies employing EE T cells adoptively transferred to 
wild-type mice as means of cellular therapy for autoimmune 
disease could potentially clarify this point. Similarly, injection of 
bone marrow wild-type cells into an irradiated EE host would 
help us identify the contribution of the immune milieu on EE 
immunomodulatory function.
We think that this study is the first step toward a systematic 
analysis of the specific effects EE exerts on different immune cells 
isolated and taken out of their physiological context. Indeed, it 
remains to be determined if the effects we have seen on CD4 cell 
differentiation are due, at least in part, to a specific contribution 
of non-T cells present in the splenocyte population. Our plan 
 11

is to expand these investigations and assess the effect of EE on 
APC-like cells, such as B cells, monocytes, and macrophages. It 
would be interesting to see if these cells also acquire a regulatory/
immunosuppressive phenotype (e.g., B-regs, healing monocytes, 
M2 macrophages). The availability of these data may shed light 
on the possible molecular mechanisms by which positive or nega-
tive environmental conditions influence the immune response. 
Further, these results would likely provide a novel list of potential 
molecular targets that could be exploited to ameliorate the treat-
ment of several immune inflammatory disorders.
