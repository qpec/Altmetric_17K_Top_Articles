During development, mesodermal progenitors from the first heart field (FHF) form a primitive
cardiac tube, to which progenitors from the second heart field (SHF) are added. The con-
tribution of FHF and SHF progenitors to the adult zebrafish heart has not been studied to
date. Here we find, using genetic tbx5a lineage tracing tools, that the ventricular myocardium
in the adult zebrafish is mainly derived from tbx5a+ cells, with a small contribution from tbx5a
− SHF progenitors. Notably, ablation of ventricular tbx5a+-derived cardiomyocytes in the
embryo is compensated by expansion of SHF-derived cells. In the adult, tbx5a expression is
restricted to the trabeculae and excluded from the outer cortical layer. tbx5a-lineage tracing
revealed that trabecular cardiomyocytes can switch their fate and differentiate into cortical
myocardium during adult heart regeneration. We conclude that a high degree of cardio-
myocyte cell fate plasticity contributes to efficient regeneration.

 T
he zebrafish is an established model organism to study
heart regeneration, in which pre-existing cardiomyocytes
proliferate to replace the lost myocardium1–3. The zebra-
fish myocardium is formed by an inner trabecular layer, a thin
primordial layer, and an outer cortical layer. During embryonic
development, cells from the primordial layer give rise to trabe-
culae4. Later, in the juvenile, trabecular cardiomyocytes breach
the primordial layer and form the cortical myocardium5,6. Pre-
vious clonal analysis suggested that during adult heart regenera-
tion, the cortical myocardium is rebuilt by cardiomyocytes from
the same layer5, suggesting some degree of commitment to a
particular myocardial layer. A higher degree of plasticity had been
observed in the embryonic heart, whereby atrial cardiomyocytes
were reported to be able to regenerate the cardiac ventricle7.
The vertebrate heart is formed from mesodermal precursor
cells derived from the first and second heart fields, also called
FHF and SHF, respectively. Cells from the FHF form the
embryonic heart tube to which cells from the SHF are added to
allow further growth. FHF and SHF progenitors have also been
described in the zebrafish8–12. Regulatory elements from the
draculin (drl) gene have been used to label a population of lateral
plate mesoderm progenitors that give rise to cardiomyocytes of
the primitive heart tube, providing a genetic marker to trace FHF-
derived myocardium11. Latent tgf beta binding protein 3 (ltbp3)
expression marks a distal drl-negative domain and has been
proposed as a SHF marker12. Of note, neither drl nor ltbp3 are
established FHF and SHF markers in other vertebrates including
mammals11.
In the mouse, retrospective clonal analysis revealed that FHF-
derived cells predominantly give rise to the left ventricle, whereas
the SHF yields the right ventricle and large parts of the atria13,14.
Further studies on the contribution of cardiac precursor cells to
the
mammalian
heart
come
from
genetic
lineage
tracing
approaches, which are based on following the fate of cells that
expressed a particular gene at a given time point of embryonic
development15–17. A key gene used to trace the fate of cardiac
precursor cells is Tbx5, encoding a T-box transcription factor,
which serves as an early cardiac marker expressed in the devel-
oping heart tube18,19. Genetic lineage tracing analysis of Tbx5-
expressing cells has revealed a strong contribution to the left
ventricular myocardium, recapitulating the fate of FHF progeni-
tors in this cardiac chamber20.
Zebrafish have two Tbx5-encoding genes, tbx5a and tbx5b;
tbx5a expression levels during heart development are higher than
those of tbx5b, and tbx5a mutants recapitulate key phenotypes of
mammalian Tbx5 perturbations21–23. We thus decided to gen-
erate genetic tools to study the contribution of the FHF to the
adult ventricle during homeostasis and regeneration in the zeb-
rafish using regulatory sequences of tbx5a. We describe that in
zebrafish the early heart tube is formed by tbx5a-derived cardi-
omyocytes to which SHF-derived tbx5a- cardiomyocytes are
added. Even though their contribution to the adult heart is
minimal, SHF-derived cells can give rise to a fully functional
ventricle if tbx5a-derived cells are genetically ablated. In the adult
heart, tbx5a expression is persistent only in the trabecular myo-
cardium, allowing to distinguish this layer from the cortical
myocardium. Genetic fate mapping of trabecular tbx5a+ cells
shows that these cells contribute to regenerate the outer cortical
layer. Together, our findings show a high degree of cardiomyocyte
fate plasticity during zebrafish heart regeneration, during both
embryonic stages and in the adult.
Results
Contribution of tbx5a+ cardiomyocytes to the adult ventricle.
We used the fluorescent bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)
transgenic reporter line tbx5a:GFP, driving green fluorescent
protein (GFP) expression under the control of the tbx5a cis-
regulatory elements24. The overall GFP expression pattern of
tbx5a:GFP recapitulated that of endogenous tbx5a expression
in embryos (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b; n = 7/7). We analysed the

 expression of tbx5a:GFP in the early heart tube, before the
addition of SHF progenitors. At this stage, the heart tube is
formed by a single sheet of cardiomyocytes named the primordial
layer5. Homogeneous tbx5a:GFP expression was detected in the
whole embryonic myocardium at 32 hours postfertilisation (hpf)
(Fig. 1a–c; n = 5/5). After this stage, at 56 hpf, (Fig. 1d–f; n = 3/3),
a GFP− region of myocardium started to become visible in the
cranial portion of the heart tube, which remained reporter-
negative at 72 hpf (Fig. 1g–i; Supplementary Movie 1, n = 5/5),
4 days postfertilisation (dpf) (Fig. 1j–l; n = 9/9), and at 5 dpf
(Fig. 1m–o; n = 6/6), concomitant with the reported addition of
SHF progenitors to the ventricular myocardium during these
stages8,12. The GFP expression pattern was confirmed by gfp
messenger RNA in situ hybridisation on heart sections of
embryos at 2–5 dpf (Supplementary Fig. 1c–g). Comparison of
the expression domains at 56 and 72 hpf between tbx5a:GFP and
the previously reported FHF marker drl:mCherry revealed an
overlap of both domains in the proximal part of the ventricle
close to the atrioventricular canal (AVC) and in the outer cur-
vature of the ventricle (Supplementary Fig. 2a–h and Supple-
mentary Movies 2 and 3; 56 hpf, n = 5/5; 72 hpf, n = 7/7). Of note,
the expression domain of tbx5a:GFP was more extensive toward
the distal myocardium. This might indicate that drl expression is
downregulated faster in FHF-derived cells than tbx5a, or that part
of the proximal SHF-derived myocardium expresses tbx5a.
Nonetheless, a clear tbx5a:GFP/drl:mCherry double-negative
domain was present in the inner curvature and distal-most por-
tion of the larval ventricle (Supplementary Fig. 2a–h and Sup-
plementary Movies 2 and 3). This tbx5a:GFP− region was further
expressing transiently injected ltbp3:TagRFP-2A-Cre12, indicating
SHF-derived ventricular myocardium (Supplementary Fig. 2i–l
and Supplementary Movie 4). Thus, in the embryonic heart,
tbx5a expression marks cardiomyocytes in the primitive heart
tube and is absent from a population of distally located ven-
tricular cardiomyocytes, which from their expression pattern and
temporal appearance match with previous descriptions of the
most distal SHF-derived cells12.
We next sought to chart tbx5a expression in the adult zebrafish
heart. During zebrafish heart maturation, a third myocardial layer
forms enveloping the primordial layer, named cortical layer.
Clonal analysis suggested that these myocardial layer derives from
trabecular cardiomyocytes5. We still detected high levels of
endogenous tbx5a mRNA and tbx5a:GFP expression in the adult
zebrafish ventricle (Fig. 2a, b and Supplementary Fig. 3; n = 8/8).
tbx5a:GFP expression was restricted to the trabecular myocar-
dium and absent from the cortical layer (Fig. 2c, d), coinciding
with the recently reported pattern obtained using an enhancer
fragment located 16 kb upstream of the tbx5a transcription start
site25.
Expression
spread
through
most
of
the
trabecular
myocardium, with a gradient from the apex (high expression)
to the basal part close to the bulbus arteriosus (BA) (lower
expression levels). In addition, we observed a region in the basal
ventricle, close to the atrium, in which we detected GFP−
trabecular cardiomyocytes. No GFP expression can be detected
in these cells beyond background and we therefore refer to this
myocardial territory as basal tbx5a− region (Fig. 2e, f; n = 13/13;
Supplementary Fig. 4).
tbx5a− cardiomyocytes in the adult heart could derive from
embryonic tbx5a+ cells that switched off their expression or from
progenitor cells that never expressed tbx5a. To test these
possibilities, we generated transgenic lines for inducible genetic
fate mapping of tbx5a-expressing cells (Fig. 3a). In double-
transgenic
tbx5a:mCherry-p2A-CreERT2;ubb:loxP-lacZ-STOP-
loxP-GFP26 embryos, mCherry labels tbx5a-expressing cells and
GFP labels the progeny of tbx5a+ cells that expressed CreERT2
recombinase at the time of 4-Hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT)-
induced recombination. This transgenic combination was not
leaky and GFP-expressing cells were visible only upon 4-OHT
administration (Fig. 3b; n = 5/5). When recombined during
embryogenesis, GFP+ cells were found in the atrium and ventricle
of the larval heart but never in the distal portion of the ventricular
myocardium (Fig. 3c–f; 8/8; Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supple-
mentary Movie 5, n = 9/9). Few epicardial cells were also tbx5a-
derived, consistent with tbx5a:tdTomato expression observed in a
subset of embryonic epicardial cells (Supplementary Fig. 6; n = 6/
7). When analysed in adult hearts, the cortical layer was mCherry
−, in agreement with our observations using the reporter tbx5a:
GFP. Nonetheless, most of the cortical layer was GFP+ and thus
derived from a tbx5a+ embryonic cell population that switched
off tbx5a expression (Fig. 3g–n; n = 5/5; Supplementary Fig. 7, 8).
Akin to the GFP pattern observed in tbx5a:GFP adult hearts, a
basal domain of the ventricle close to the BA was also mCherry−
(Fig. 3g–j and 3o–r, and Supplementary Fig. 7, 8; n = 5/5).
Furthermore, this domain was also GFP−, suggesting that it
derives from the tbx5a− distal embryonic ventricle. Thus, we
propose that tbx5a+-derived cells in the adult heart predomi-
nantly comprise the FHF derivatives of the embryonic heart and
the tbx5a− domain in the basal ventricle close to the atrium and
BA is SHF-derived. Taken together, our genetic lineage tracing of
embryonic myocardial populations into adulthood in zebrafish
reveal a fate compartmentalisation of tbx5a− and tbx5a+-derived
cardiomyocytes

 ventricular cardiomyocytes using the ventricular myosin heavy
chain like (vmhcl) cis-regulatory elements (Fig. 4a; Supplementary
Fig. 9; n = 10/10). vmhcl is expressed exclusively in ventricular
and not atrial cardiomyocytes27. We crossed vmhcl:loxP-tagBFP-
loxP-mCherry-NTR with tbx5a:CreERT2. This allowed to lineage-
trace tbx5a+ (mCherry+) and tbx5a− ventricular cardiomyocytes
(tagBFP+). Furthermore, this genetic strategy allows the ablation
of tbx5a+ ventricular cardiomyocytes by adding Metronidazole
(Mtz) to induce cell death in nitroreductase (NTR)-expressing
cells28. Administration of 4-OHT from 24 to 48 hpf induced the
expression of mCherry-NTR in tbx5a-derived cardiomyocytes in
the trabecular and primordial layer of the embryonic ventricle,
with the exception of the distal-most part at the cranial pole
(Fig. 4b, c, n = 7/7). In adult hearts, most ventricular cardio-
myocytes were mCherry+. Only a small portion of cardiomyo-
cytes close to the BA and AVC was tagBFP+ (Fig. 4d, e),
coinciding with the results obtained doing lineage tracing using
tbx5a:mCherry-p2A-CreERT2;ubb:loxP-lacZ-STOP-loxP-GFP.
To
specifically ablate mCherry+ cardiomyocytes we administered
Mtz from 4 to 7 dpf (Supplementary Fig. 10). Surprisingly,
30 days later, a complete ventricle had regenerated from tagBFP+
cardiomyocytes, suggesting that SHF-derived ventricular cardio-
myocytes are able to compensate the genetic ablation of the FHF-
derived

 Supplementary Fig. 11). In the experimental setup all atrial car-
diomyocytes are tbx5a lineage-derived and thus would become
mCherry+ if they contributed to the ventricle (Supplementary
Fig. 5 and Supplementary Movie 5, n = 9/9). Thus, our results
reveal that ventricular tbx5a− SHF-derived cells compensated for
the loss of tbx5a+ ventricular cardiomyocytes. To confirm abla-
tion of tbx5a-derived mCherry-NTR expressing cells, we per-
formed terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated
dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining to detect apoptosis
(Fig. 5a–g; n = 8 larvae + Mtz group and n = 8 –Mtz group) and
detected a significant increase of TUNEL+ mCherry+ trabecular
and primordial cardiomyocytes in the Mtz-treated group. In
agreement, tagBFP+ ventricular cardiomyocytes incorporated
significantly more 5-bBromo-2´-deoxyuridine (BrdU) upon Mtz
treatment,
indicating
proliferation
of
this
cell
population
(Fig. 5h–m).
Ablation of tbx5a-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes led to a
transient impairment of cardiac function. At 7 dpf, right after the
Mtz treatment, the ventricles revealed an irregular shape and
displayed
diminished
pumping
efficiency
(Supplementary
Fig. 12a–e and Supplementary Movie 6). However, mortality
was not significantly increased (Supplementary Fig. 12f). Indeed,
in the adults, the regenerated hearts revealed normal ventricular
pumping efficiency (Supplementary Fig. 12g). Taken together,
our results demonstrate that the loss of FHF-derived cardiomyo-
cytes
is
compensated
by
an
expansion
of
SHF-derived
cardiomyocytes.
Cardiomyocyte plasticity during adult heart regeneration. We
next explored whether this observed cardiomyocyte plasticity
remains in the adult. Upon cryoinjury, cardiomyocytes at the site
of injury proliferate and rebuild the lost cortical and trabecular
myocardium1,2. Using our transgenic tools, which genetically
discriminate between cortical and trabecular cardiomyocytes, we
investigated the plasticity of trabecular cardiomyocyte cell fate
during regeneration. First, we analysed the expression of tbx5a:
GFP during heart regeneration using cryoinjury (Supplementary
Fig. 13a). tbx5a:GFP was highly expressed in uninjured trabeculae
at all stages analysed. At 1 days postinjury (dpi), no GFP
expression could be found in the cortical layer (Supplementary
Fig. 13b–f; n = 4/4). In contrast, at 3 dpi (Supplementary
Fig. 13g–k; n = 4/5), 7 dpi (Supplementary Fig. 13l–p; n = 3/3),
and 21 dpi (Supplementary Fig. 13q–u; n = 4/4), few tbx5a:GFP+
cardiomyocytes could be observed in the cortical layer close to the
injured area. Nonetheless, at 130 dpi, the regenerated cortical
myocardium was tbx5a:GFP− (Supplementary Fig. 13v–z; n = 4/
4). This transient expression of tbx5a in cortical cardiomyocytes
can have two explanations: (a) tbx5a is re-expressed transiently in
the cortical layer during regeneration, or (b) trabecular cardio-
myocytes are contributing to the new cortical layer.
To evaluate these two possibilities, tbx5a-derived cells were
genetically traced using tbx5a:mCherry-p2A-CreERT2;ubb:loxP-
STOP-loxP-GFP double-transgenic fish (Fig. 6a). Upon recombi-
nation, GFP expression was restricted to the trabeculae in
uninjured hearts (Fig. 6b–g; n = 7/7) and we only rarely detected
GFP+ cells in the cortical myocardium (two cells in one out of six
completely sectioned hearts, Supplementary Fig. 14a–f). By
contrast, we observed GFP+/mCherry− cells in the regenerated
cortical layer at 21 dpi (Fig. 6h–m; n = 6/7) and 90 dpi (Fig. 6n,
o–s; n = 6/6), indicating that these cells derived from tbx5a+ cells
had switched off tbx5a expression. In the remote area, GFP+ cells
remained restricted to the trabecular layer even upon cryoinjury
(Fig. 6t–x; n = 5/6). Based on the percentage of trabecular
cardiomyocytes that are GFP+, the recombination efficiency was
estimated to be 10 ± 6%. In the newly formed cortical layer, 7 ±

 4% of cardiomyocytes are GFP+ (n = 10). Therefore, trabeculae
might contribute to a higher extent to the regenerating cortical
layer than estimated by GFP signal detection.
To confirm that these cells came from tbx5a+ trabeculae and
were not produced by leaky recombination in response to injury,
we repeated the experiment in the absence of 4-OHT adminis-
tration;
we
found
no
GFP+-recombined
cells
within
the
regenerated area (Supplementary Fig. 14g–q; n = 3/3). We further
excluded that the result is caused by 4-OHT remaining in the
body at the moment of injury through treating zebrafish with 4-
OHT 10 and 11 days before the injury (Supplementary Fig. 14r–w;
n = 5/5). Taken together, our results reveal that trabeculae
contribute to the regeneration of cortical myocardium. This
process occurs concomitantly to the downregulation of tbx5a
expression, suggesting that trabecular cardiomyocytes change
their specification and become cortical cardiomyocytes.
The list of genes to discriminate cortical from trabecular
myocardium in the zebrafish is short: besides the herein reported
tbx5a expression pattern and nppa29, no other markers have been
described to differentiate cortical from trabecular myocardium in
the zebrafish. To interrogate whether tbx5a-derived trabecular
cardiomyocytes not only relocate into the cortical region and
switch off tbx5a but also adopt the expression of cortical marker
genes, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) comparing
tbx5a-positive and -negative cardiomyocytes isolated from adult
ventricles (Fig. 7a, b) . tbx5a was the top gene differentially
expressed between the two populations (Fig. 7c and Supplemen-
tary Data 1), further supporting that the transgenic tbx5a reporter
lines reproduce the endogenous pattern. A number of genes
related to actin cytoskeleton, extracellular matrix, and caveolae
were expressed specifically in tbx5a− cardiomyocytes (Fig. 7c, d):
two of these markers, xirp2a30 and lama5, were validated by
immunofluorescence for their protein product (Figs. 8 and 9). In
uninjured hearts, Xirp2a was detected in the cortical myocardium

contributed to the cortical layer and switched off tbx5a:mCherry
also expressed Xirp2a (Fig. 8g–r, n = 6/6). Laminin was detected
in the cortical layer (Fig. 9a–f, n = 3/3) and, upon injury, cortically

 located tbx5a-derived GFP+ were in a Laminin+ environment;
Fig. 9g–r, n = 6/6). This result was further supported using a
RNAScope protocol to detect lama5 mRNA in situ (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 15; a-h, n = 4/4; i-p, n = 11/11). A third gene used to
determine whether tbx5a-derived cardiomyocytes express cortical
markers when found in the cortical myocardium was hey2, a well-
established marker of the compact layer in the embryonic mouse
heart31 (Supplementary Fig. 16). hey2 mRNA in situ detection by
RNAScope revealed expression in cardiomyocytes from the
cortical myocardium of the adult zebrafish (Supplementary Fig. 16
a-h; n = 3/4). tbx5a-derived trabecular cardiomyocytes that were
within the cortical region at 90 dpi co-localized with hey2 staining
(Supplementary Fig. 16 i-m; n = 5/6). Of note, tbx5a-derived cells
within the trabecular myocardium did not reveal similar hey2
expression levels (Supplementary Fig. 16 n-p; n = 5/6). On the
contrary, the expression of the trabecular marker nppa was not
retained in tbx5a-derived cells within the cortical myocardium
(Supplementary Fig. 17, n = 7/7), altogether indicating that
trabecular tbx5a+ cardiomyocytes undergo a true phenotypic
switch to become cortical layer cardiomyocytes. Although the
cortical myocardium had previously been reported to regenerate
from cardiomyocytes within the same layer5, our results reveal
that trabecular cardiomyocytes can also contribute to cortical
layer repair in response to injury.
Discussion
In the developing hearts of birds and mammals, a border between
Tbx5-positive and -negative cells determines the region of ven-
tricular septation32. Our results here establish that the embryonic
ventricle in zebrafish is concomitantly also split into tbx5a+ and
tbx5a− domains. A similar boundary between drl+ and drl− cells
has been described to separate the embryonic ventricle into
domains to control distinct physiological properties11, suggesting
that similar to mammals, adult teleost cardiac ventricles maintain
FHF and SHF lineage territories (Fig. 10a). Although the zebrafish
ventricle is not septated, the presence of a FHF–SHF-like

Fig. 6 Contribution of tbx5a-derived cells during regeneration of the adult zebrafish heart. a tbx5a:Cherry-p2A-CreERT2 was crossed into ubb:loxP-lacZ-STOP-

 boundary might represent a state that has been further progressed
in evolution to allow morphogenetic events leading to septation.
Our results indicate that cardiomyocyte plasticity allows the
ventricle to re-form exclusively from SHF-derived cardiomyo-
cytes (Fig. 10b). Of note, in mammals, Tbx5 expression labels the
derivatives of the FHF in the ventricle and also the boundary with
the SHF19,20; thus, we cannot exclude that the contribution of the
SHF is slightly bigger than described in our study. Nonetheless,
our results show that SHF cardiomyocytes can compensate the
loss of the whole FHF-derived ventricle.
tbx5a lineage tracing allowed (i) to confirm that the cortical
layer forms during development from the trabecular myo-
cardium5 and (ii) to identify that this process involves not only a
change in location of cardiomyocytes from the trabecular to the
cortical regions but also a change in gene expression (Fig. 10a).
In contrast to development, cardiomyocyte plasticity seems to
be reduced in the regenerating adult heart:19 conversion of atrial
cardiomyocytes to ventricular cardiomyocytes has not been
conclusively reported7 and Gupta et al.5 described that the newly
regenerated cortical layer derives from pre-exising cortical layer
cardiomyocytes. Indeed, the general rule during regeneration is
that every cell contributes to the same cell type it was before
injury, as illustrated by the cell types comprising the axolotl
limb33. In contrast, our results show that a breach of this behavior
is possible, with trabecular cardiomyocytes re-specialising into
cortical layer cardiomyocytes during regeneration of the adult

 developmental process in the setting of regeneration to rebuild
the injured heart. It is interesting to note that zebrafish hearts are
highly trabeculated in comparison with adult mammals. In
murine cardiogenesis, the trabecular myocardium is proliferating
at a much lower rate than the compact myocardium34. Thus, the
switch from a trabecular phenotype to cortical phenotype might
additionally allow the cardiomyocytes to re-enter a more active
rate of cycling, allowing them to drive the regeneration after
cryoinjury in the adult context. We propose that cardiomyocyte
plasticity is thus likely a key feature necessary to react efficiently
with a regenerative response to injury.
Methods
Animal handling and generation of transgenic lines. Ethical approval was
obtained from the Community of Madrid “Dirección General de Medio Ambiente”
in Spain and the “Amt für Landwirtschaft und Natur” from the Canton of Bern,
Switzerland. Animals were housed and experiments performed in accordance with
Spanish and Swiss bioethical regulations for the use of laboratory animals. Fish
were maintained at a water temperature of 28 °C.
The construct to generate Tg(tbx5a:tdTomato) transgenic zebrafish lines was
made by recombining the tdTomato cassette (Supplementary Data 2) into the BAC
CH73-99A14. The construct for Tg(tbx5a:mCherry-p2A-CreERT2)cn4 was generated
by recombining the iTol2Amp cassette35 (Supplementary Table 1, primers 1,2) and
mCherry-p2A-CreERT2 (Supplementary Data 3 and Supplementary Table 1,
primers 3,4) into the same BAC. The construct to generate Tg(tbx5a:CreERT2)cn3
was made by recombining iTol2Amp-γ-crystallin:RFP (Supplementary Data 4 and
Supplementary Table 2, primers 2,5) and CreERT2 (Supplementary Table 1;
primers 4,6) cassettes into the same BAC. Tg(vmhcl:loxP-myctagBFP-STOP-loxP-
NTR-mCherry)cn5 was generated using a construct obtained from recombining
iTol2Amp35 (Supplementary Table 1, primers 1,2) and loxP-myctagBFP-STOP-
loxP-mCherry-NTR (Supplementary Data 5 and Supplementary Table 2, primers
7,8) cassettes into the BAC CH73-204E19. Plasmid templates for recombineering
were cloned using Gibson Assembly (NEB). Recombineering was performed
combining the pRedET (GeneBridges, Germany) system and EL250 bacteria36. Tg
(-3.5ubb:loxP-lacZ-loxP-eGFP)cn2 26 was outcrossed for six generations to isolate
the best insertion. BAC DNA was injected at 25 ng μl−1 into one-cell stage zebrafish
embryos along with 1 nl of 50 ng μl−1 synthetic Tol2 mRNA in Danieau buffer.
Transient ltbp3:TagRFP-2A-Cre embryos in the stable tbx5a:GFP background were
generated by injecting a Tol2 plasmid containing the vector ltbp3:TagRFP-p2A-
Cre12 into one-cell stage Tg(tbx5a:GFP) embryos. Around 150 embryos survived
the microinjection and were screened for mCherry expression. The transgenic line
drl:mCherry zh705 (in full Tg(-6.3drl:mCherry)zh705) based on transgene vector
pCM330 was generated using Multisite Gateway assembly of pCM293 (pENTR5’
backbone containing 6.35 kb of the zebrafish drl locus (ZDB-GENE-991213-3)
amplified with primers 5′-GTCAGCACCAGATGCCTGTGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-
CCAAGTGTGAATTGGGATCG-3′ (reverse) as described37), Tol2kit38 #386 (pME-
mCherry), #302 (p3E_SV40polyA), and #394 (pDestTol2A2) (in total
pDestTol2pA2_drl:mCherry, referred to as drl:mCherry); plasmid DNA was injected
at 25 ng μl−1 into one-cell stage zebrafish embryos that were then raised and
screened for germline transmission of the transgenic reporter with subsequent
outcrossing to isolate a single transgene insertion39. The drl:mCherry transgenics
used in the study are at least seventh-generation transgenics. The line Tg(-26.5Hsa.
WT1-gata2:EGFP)cn1 40 contains a reporter construct flanked by flippase
recognition target sites, in which cardiac actin drives the expression of RFP. This
cassette was removed by injection of flippase mRNA into the one-cell stage. This
line was called Tg(−26.5Hsa.WT1-gata2:EGFP)cn12 and was replacing Tg
(−26.5Hsa.WT1-gata2:EGFP)cn1.
In adults, 10 µM 4-OHT (Sigma, H7904) was administered at the indicated
times. Treatments were performed overnight. Before administration, the 10 mM
stock (dissolved in ethanol) was heated 10 min at 65 °C39. For genetic labeling in
tbx5a:mCherry-p2A-CreERT2;3.5ubb:loxP-lacZ-loxP-eGFP embryos, 4-OHT was
administered at 10 µM from 24 to 48 hpf and at 5 µM from 48 to 84 hpf. Cryoinjury
was performed as previously described using a copper filament cooled in liquid
nitrogen and placed on the ventricular surface of the heart until thawing41. The
pericardial cavity had been previously opened to expose the heart, in anesthetized
animals. For genetic ablation experiments and their controls, 4-OHT was
administered at 5 µM from 24 to 48 hpf and then Mtz (Sigma, M3761) was added
at 10 mM from 96 to 168 hpf. Other lines used were TgBAC(tbx5a:GFP)in2Tg;24
Tg(myl7:nDsRed)f242 Tg(myl7:membranemCherry)43, Tg(3.5ubb:loxP-mCherry-
loxP-eGFP)44, and Et(−26.5Hsa.WT1-gata2:EGFP)cn1 (epi:GFP)40.
For all the experiments involving Cre recombination or cell ablation,
hemizygous fish were used. For experiments using only the Tg(tbx5a:GFP) line,
homozygous and hemizygous fish were used interchangeably.
BrdU was added to E3 water at 5 mg ml−1 with 0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide from 4
to 7 dpf.

 Histology. Samples for Fig. 2a Fig. 3a, and Supplementary Figures 1c–g, 3, 4,
13 and 17 were fixed in 4% pParaformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) overnight at 4 °C. Samples were then washed in 0.1% Tween20 (Merck) in
PBS, dehydrated through an ethanol series, and embedded in paraffin wax. Samples
were sectioned at 7 μm with a microtome (Leica), sections mounted on Superfrost
slides (Fisher Scientific), and dried overnight at 37 °C.
The rest of sections were obtained by fixing in 4% PFA washing in PBS + 0.1%
Tween20 (PBT), incubated in 15% saccharose overnight 4 °C. Then, samples were
embedded in 30% gelatin 15% saccharose and snap frozen at − 80 °C in isopentane.
Tissue was cut at 8 μm on a cryostat (Leica).
In situ mRNA hybridization. In situ mRNA hybridisation on paraffin sections and
on whole-mount larvae were performed as described45,46 using tbx5a (com-
plementary DNA kindly provided by C. Neumann), GFP (cDNA kindly provided
by J.L. Gómez-Skarmeta), and nppa47 riboprobes.
Paraffin sections were deparaffinized, postfixed 20 min with PFA 4%, washed
with PBS, treated with proteinase K 10 µm ml−1 for 10 min at 37 °C, washed with
PBS, postfixed with PFA 4% for 5 min, washed with PBS, treated with HCl 0.07 N
for 15 min, washed with PBS, treated with 0.25% acetic anhydride in
triethanolamine 0.1 M pH 8 for 10 min, washed with PBS, washed with RNase-free
water, and then hybridised with the probe in pre-hybridisation buffer over night at
65 °C. The following day, sections were washed twice with post-hybridisation
buffer 1 (50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 1% SDS) for 30 min at 65 °C and twice more
with post-hybridisation buffer 2 (50% formamide, 2 × saline-sodium citrate SSC,
1% SDS). Then, sections were washed with maleic acid buffer with 0.1% Tween
20 (MABT) buffer at room temperature and incubated at least 2 h in blocking
solution at room temperature. They were next incubated overnight with anti-dig-
alkaline phosphatase (AP) antibody (1 : 2,000) in blocking solution. The third day,
they were washed with MABT for several hours, followed by washes in AP buffer.
Sections were developed in BM-Purple (Roche) until signal was detected.
For whole-mount in situ hybridisations, embryos were fixed in 4% PFA
overnight, dehydrated in methanol series, and stored at − 20 °C until its use. On
day 1, embryos were rehydrated, washed in PBT, digested with 10 µg ml−1 for 15
min, rinsed in PBT, and fixed in 4% PFA for 10 min. After washing again in PBT,
they were pre-hybridised at 67 °C for at least 1 h. The antisense riboprobe was
added at 0.5 µg ml−1. After overnight hybridisation, two washes with 50%
formamide/2 × SSCT, one wash with 2 × SSCT, and an additional two washes with
0.2 × SSCT were performed, all at 67 °C. Then, embryos were transferred to room
temperature and washed in MABT. Antibody incubation, washing, and color
development condition times were as for in situ on sections. RNAScope (Advanced
Cell Diagnostics, Hayward, CA) was performed following the manufacturer’s
instructions for formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples with standard tissue
pretreatment and 2.5 HD RED detection kit.
Immunofluorescence and TUNEL in whole-mount embryos. Embryos were fixed
in 4 % PFA overnight, washed in 0.1% Tween20 in PBS, and permeabilised with
0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS for 20 min. Several washing steps were followed
by 2 h of blocking with 5% goat serum, 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 20
mM MgCl2 in PBS, followed by incubation with antibodies overnight. Apoptosis
was detected by TUNEL staining using the in situ cell death detection kit from
Roche (Mannheim, Germany), incubating fish embryos in enzyme solution for
1 h48.
Immunofluorescence on sections. Paraffin sections were deparaffinized, rehy-
drated, and washed in distilled water. Epitopes were retrieved by heating in 10 mM
citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 15 min in a microwave at full power. Gelatine sections
were incubated instead 30 min in 0.1% Tween20 in PBS at 37 °C to dissolve the
gelatin. Nonspecific binding sites were saturated by incubation for at least 1 h in
blocking solution (5% BSA, 5% goat serum, and 20 mM MgCl2 in PBS). Endo-
genous biotin was blocked with the avidin–biotin blocking kit (Vector, Burlingame,
CA, USA).
Antibodies. Primary antibodies used were anti-Myosin Heavy Chain (MF20,
DSHB, 1 : 20 and F59, DSHB, 1 : 20), anti-GFP (AVES, GFP-1010, 1 : 500; 632592,
Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA, 1 : 100), anti-RFP (ab34771, AbCam, 1 : 200),
anti-Xirp2a30, a kind gift from C. Otten and S. Seyfried (1 : 500), anti-Laminin
(L9393, Sigma, 1 : 200), anti-BrdU (BD Biosciences, B44, 1 : 100), anti-mKate49 to
detect tagBFP (1 : 500). Biotin- or Alexa (488, 568, 633)-conjugated secondary
antibodies, and streptavidin-Cy3 (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories) were
used at 1 : 300. Nuclei were stained with 4',6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)
and slides were mounted in Fluorsave (Calbiochem).
Imaging and Image analysis. Embryos were imaged with a Zeiss 780 confocal
microscope using a × 20 objective with a dipping lens. Z-stacks were taken every 1
μm. Three-dimensional images were reconstructed with ImageJ software. A Leica
TCS SP-5 or a Nikon A1R confocal microscope was used for imaging of histolo-
gical sections. The percentage of tagBFP cells was quantified using ImageJ con-
sidering the area of tagBFP and comparing it with the area of myosin heavy chain
(MHC) staining.

 The percentage of tbx5a-derived cells was quantified applying a median filter of
radius 1 in ImageJ. The GFP+ and MHC+ areas were measured. The same set of
images was used to quantify the percentage of GFP+ cardiomyocytes in trabeculae
and in the regenerated compact layer, applying the same threshold for both
regions.
In vivo imaging and image processing. Double transgenic Tg(tbx5a:tdTomato);Et
(-26.5Hsa.WT1-gata2:EGFP) lines were grown until 60 hpf in E3 culture medium
with 0.0033% 1-Phenyl-2thiourea. Embryos were anesthetized with 0.08 mg ml−1
Tricaine and embedded in 1 % low melting agarose (Bio-Rad Low Melt Agarose).
Confocal imaging of the embryonic heart was performed with a Zeiss LSM880,
using a × 20/0.8 air-objective lens. The green (GFP) and red (tdTomato) channels
were acquired simultaneously with maximum speed in bidirectional mode. Z-
stacks were acquired over 8 h with 10 min time interval. The range of detection for
each channel was adapted to avoid any crosstalk between the channels. A median
filter was applied to a representative frame to show co-expression of the epicardial
marker and tbx5a.
Ultrasound and assessment of cardiac function in larvae. Measurements and
analysis were performed as described47. A mixture of 60 mM of tricaine and 3 mM
of isofluorane were added to the tank water in order to anesthetize the animals. A
Petri dish was filled with this solution and the fish was placed ventral side up in a
foam holder. Once the animal was anesthetised, the images were obtained with a
VEVO 2100 system (VisualSonics) coupled to a 50 MHz ultrasound transducer.
The probe was lowered until an ultrasound conductive film was formed with the
water, so that the skin of the animal was not touched at any time. This way the
animal position was rotated till we obtained a long axis view of the heart with a
complete visualisation of the ventricular apex. In that moment we recorded cine
two-dimensional sequences, with a frame rate of 200 images per second, which
were analysed later, in a second step, to minimize anesthesia times.
Imaging of cardiac function in larvae was performed using a Leica AM TIRF
MC microscope in epifluorescence mode, using an Andor DU 885K-CS0-#VP
(1,004 × 1,002) camera and HCX PL APO 20 × 0,7 dry (11,506,166) objective. The
maximum (diastolic) and minimum (systolic) ventricular areas were measured in
order to determine ventricular function using Image J.
Heart dissociation followed by sorter and RNA-Seq library production. Zeb-
rafish hearts were dissected and the atrio-ventricular canal was carefully removed
in order to obtain a pool of exclusively ventricular cells. The ventricles were dis-
sociated according to previous protocols50 with minor modifications. The enzyme
concentration was doubled and time of digestion increased to 1 h and 40 min with
gentle agitation while pipetting with a cut 1,000 µl tip every 20–30 min. Then, one
volume of PBS + 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) was added and the mixture was
centrifuged for 8 min at 250 g and re-suspended in PBS + 1% FBS. Specifically, the
following enzyme concentrations were used: liberase TH (Sigma, 200 mg l−1),
Elastase (Serva, 1 : 250), Pronase E (Serva, 1 : 100 dilution of the 26.3 mg ml−1
stock), DNase (Qiagen, 1 : 20,000) and 2,3-butanedione monoxime (Sigma, 10
mM). All reagents were dissolved in Tyrode’s low calcium (in mM): NaCl 140, KCl
5.4, CaCl2 0.01, MgCl2 1.0, glucose 5.5, and HEPES 5.0; pH was set to 7.4 with
NaOH.
Cells were sorted using a SONY Synergy sy3200 sorter and RNA was extracted
using the Arcturus Pico Pure RNA isolation kit (Thermofisher) following the
manufacturer’s instructions.

 Total RNA (0.6 ng) was used to generate barcoded RNA-Seq libraries using the
Ovation Single Cell RNA-Seq System (NuGEN) with two rounds of library
amplification. The size of the libraries was calculated using the Agilent 2100
Bioanalyzer. Library concentration was determined using the Qubit fluorometer
(ThermoFisher Scientific). Libraries were sequenced on a HiSeq2500 (Illumina)
platform to generate 60-base single reads. FastQ files for each sample were obtained
using CASAVA v1.8 software (Illumina). Four biological replicates consisting of
five pooled hearts were used per sample.
RNA-Seq analysis. Sequencing adaptor contaminations were removed from reads
using cutadapt 1.9.1 software51 and the resulting reads were mapped and quantified
on the transcriptome (Ensembl gene-build 10, release 82) using RSEM v1.2.2552.
Only genes with at least one count per million in at least two samples were
considered for statistical analysis. Data were then normalised and differential
expression tested using the bioconductor package EdgeR53. We considered as
differentially expressed those genes with a Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted p-value ≤
0.05 and log fold change ≥ 1. A heatmap was made using gplot library and heat-
map.2 function.
