 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 
1482 
MMWR / January 6, 2017 / Vol. 65 / No. 52
US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
On December 30, 2016, this report was posted as an MMWR 
Early Release on the MMWR website (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr).
The introduction of Zika virus into the Region of the 
Americas (Americas) and the subsequent increase in cases 
of congenital microcephaly resulted in activation of CDC’s 
Emergency Operations Center on January 22, 2016, to ensure a 
coordinated response and timely dissemination of information, 
and led the World Health Organization to declare a Public 
Health Emergency of International Concern on February 1, 
2016. During the past year, public health agencies and research-
ers worldwide have collaborated to protect pregnant women, 
inform clinicians and the public, and advance knowledge about 
Zika virus (Figure 1). This report summarizes 10 important 
contributions toward addressing the threat posed by Zika 
virus in 2016. To protect pregnant women and their fetuses 
and infants from the effects of Zika virus infection during 
pregnancy, public health activities must focus on preventing 
mosquito-borne transmission through vector control and per-
sonal protective practices, preventing sexual transmission by 
advising abstention from sex or consistent and correct use of 
condoms, and preventing unintended pregnancies by reducing 
barriers to access to highly effective reversible contraception.
1. Issuing Travel Guidance to Warn Pregnant 
Women Not to Travel to Areas with Ongoing 
Zika Virus Transmission
On January 15, 2016, CDC issued a travel notice to alert 
travelers about the risk of Zika virus transmission in 14 coun-
tries and territories in Central and South America and the 
Caribbean, including Puerto Rico. As of December 15, 2016, 
a total of 60 international Zika travel notices have been issued, 
including 49 in the Americas. These notices advise pregnant 
women to avoid travel to areas of active Zika virus transmission, 
provide recommendations for travelers to avoid exposure to 
Zika virus, and inform returning travelers about transmission 
prevention and testing. On August 1, 2016, after the first 
instance of confirmed mosquito-borne Zika virus transmis-
sion in the continental United States, CDC issued domestic 
travel and diagnostic testing guidance for pregnant women 
and women of reproductive age living in or traveling to an 
area of Miami-Dade County, Florida (1). On November 28, 
2016, local mosquito-borne transmission of Zika virus was 
reported in Brownsville (Cameron County), Texas, and on 
December 14, 2016, CDC issued guidance for travel and test-
ing of pregnant women and women of reproductive age living 
in or traveling to Brownsville (2). CDC has continued to col-
laborate closely with state and local jurisdictions to determine 
when to issue, revise, or lift domestic travel guidance on the 
basis of epidemiologic evidence (3–5).
2. Publishing Clinical Guidance for the Care of 
Pregnant Women and Infants
As a newly recognized congenital infection, Zika virus pres-
ents unique challenges for obstetric and pediatric health care 
providers. CDC’s first Zika-related clinical guidance outlining 
evaluation, testing, and clinical management of Zika virus in 
pregnant women was released on January 19, 2016 (6), and 
on January 26, 2016, guidance for the evaluation and test-
ing of infants with possible congenital Zika virus infection 
was released (7). As new evidence emerged, CDC updated 
pregnancy and infant guidance and developed guidance for 
reproductive-aged women (8–13). These evidence-based 
recommendations have been disseminated to health care 
providers through partnerships with professional organiza-
tions, including the American College of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics, and 
have provided clear guidance for providers monitoring and 
caring for pregnant women and fetuses and infants affected 
by Zika virus infection.
3. Identifying Sexual Transmission of 
Zika Virus Infection
In late January, CDC, in collaboration with Texas health 
officials, confirmed sexual contact as the source of Zika virus 
infection in a Dallas man whose partner had traveled to Brazil 
(14) and issued guidance for the prevention of sexual trans-
mission of Zika virus in February (15). To date, 38 cases of 
sexually transmitted Zika virus infection have been confirmed 
in the United States (16). Most cases have involved transmis-
sion from symptomatic men to women (17); however, cases 
of male-to-male (14), female-to-male (18), and asymptom-
atic male-to-female (19) sexual transmission have also been 
documented. In April and May, CDC initiated two studies to 
determine the frequency and duration of Zika virus shedding

in the semen and urine of infected men. CDC continues to 
work closely with state, local, and territorial health officials to 
identify and investigate possible cases of sexual transmission of 
Zika virus. As new information regarding sexual transmission 
emerges, one recommendation remains consistent: men who 
live in or have traveled to an area with active Zika virus trans-
mission should prevent sexual transmission to their pregnant 
partners by abstaining from sex or consistently and correctly 
using condoms for the duration of their partner’s pregnancy 
(10,12,13,15).
4. Monitoring Blood Safety and Availability
Because of known transfusion-transmission risks associated 
with other flaviviruses, Zika virus was recognized as a potential 
threat to blood safety. The Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) and CDC collaborated to recommend travel and 
risk factor–related deferrals for all U.S. blood donors; in 
February 2016, FDA issued guidance recommending that, 
until laboratory screening of blood donations or pathogen-
reduction technology could be implemented, blood centers 
in areas with active mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission 
cease local blood collection and import blood from U.S. areas 
without active transmission (20). Because of ongoing local 
transmission of Zika virus in Puerto Rico and unavailability 
of either screening or pathogen-reduction technology for all 
blood products, CDC, in collaboration with the Puerto Rico 
Department of Health, conducted a rapid assessment of blood 
collection and use on the island to help guide blood impor-
tation measures (21). Blood importation, supported by the 
Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, 
continued for Puerto Rico until April 2016, when Zika virus 
screening of blood donations was implemented under an 
FDA-approved investigational new drug application (21–23). 
Based on increasing reports of persons infected through travel 
as well as local transmission, FDA expanded its blood screening 
recommendations in August 2016 to include all areas of the 
United States (24). As of December 10, 2016, products from 
78 donations in the continental United States and Hawaii 
and 353 donations in Puerto Rico have been prevented from 
entering the blood supply as a result of screening.
5. Developing and Distributing Laboratory 
Test Kits and Reagents
Working with FDA, CDC obtained the first two emer-
gency use authorizations for CDC-developed in vitro tests to 
diagnose Zika virus infection: the Zika immunoglobulin M 
capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MAC-ELISA) 
on February 26, 2016 and the Trioplex real-time reverse tran-
scription–polymerase chain reaction assay for the detection 
and differentiation of RNA from dengue, chikungunya, and 
Zika viruses on March 17, 2016. CDC manufactured and 
conducted quality control testing of reagents required for both 
tests and distributed them domestically and to approximately 
100 countries (Figure 2). CDC continues to provide guidance 
to laboratories on all aspects of testing and interpretation of 
test results for all Zika virus emergency use authorization tests 
(25). CDC has continued to work to expand Zika immuno-
globulin M testing capacity by entering into material transfer 
agreements and biologic material licensing agreements with 
commercial laboratories.
6. Establishing a Causal Link Between Zika Virus 
Infection During Pregnancy and Serious Brain 
Abnormalities, Including Microcephaly
In collaboration with colleagues from Brazil, CDC pathol-
ogy experts identified the first evidence of Zika virus infection 
in the fetal brain and in placental tissues, providing evidence 
of the possible role of Zika virus infection during pregnancy 
in adverse fetal and infant outcomes (26,27). In April 2016, 
CDC authors published a comprehensive analysis of the data, 
concluding that sufficient evidence existed to support a causal 
relationship between Zika virus infection during pregnancy 
and microcephaly and other brain abnormalities (28). As of 
December 15, 2016, 29 countries and territories have reported 
potential cases of congenital Zika syndrome.*
7. Gathering and Analyzing Zika Pregnancy 
Surveillance Data to Understand the Magnitude 
of the Risk and the Full Range of Fetal and 
Infant Outcomes
To monitor the effect of Zika virus infection during preg-
nancy, pregnancy and infant surveillance was put in place 
in U.S. states and territories (29). The U.S. Zika Pregnancy 
Registry was established in coordination with state, local, tribal, 
and territorial health departments to monitor all states and 
territories except Puerto Rico. In Puerto Rico, the Zika Active 
Pregnancy Surveillance System was established to address 
specific needs resulting from the anticipated large outbreak 
(30). CDC also collaborated with the Instituto Nacional de 
Salud (National Institute of Health) in Colombia to conduct 
enhanced surveillance of pregnant women with symptomatic 
Zika virus disease in three cities (31). These surveillance sys-
tems continue to provide information about the magnitude of 
risk, the gestational timing of highest risk, and the spectrum 
of congenital Zika syndrome. Data reported to the U.S. Zika 
Pregnancy Registry from the continental United States and

Hawaii suggest that among pregnant women with laboratory 
evidence of possible Zika virus infection, approximately 6% of 
fetuses or infants have a birth defect potentially related to Zika 
virus, and among women with first-trimester Zika infection, 
11% of fetuses or infants have evidence of Zika-associated birth 
defects (32). The proportion of completed pregnancies affected 
by birth defects was similar following either symptomatic or 
asymptomatic infection during pregnancy (32). This estimate is 
consistent with models based on the outbreak in Bahia, Brazil, 
which estimated a 1%–13% risk for microcephaly after a Zika 
virus infection during the first trimester (33).
8. Improving Access to the Full Range of 
Voluntary, Reversible Contraception Methods to 
Decrease Unintended Pregnancies as a Strategy 
to Reduce the Impact of Zika Virus Infection
Prevention of unintended pregnancies is a primary strategy to 
reduce births of infants with Zika-related birth defects. A review 
of contraception use in Puerto Rico demonstrated limited sup-
ply, few trained providers, a cumbersome referral process, and 
limited provider reimbursement (34). The CDC Foundation, 
in collaboration with local partners and CDC, established the 
Zika Contraceptive Access Network (Z-CAN), with the aim 
of building a network of providers trained in contraception 
counseling and provision, securing sufficient contraceptive 
products to meet the needs of women in Puerto Rico, and 
raising awareness about the role of contraception in the con-
text of Zika. By the end of 2016, among the 150 physicians 
actively providing obstetrical services in Puerto Rico, 105 (70%) 
had been trained and mentored on provision of all reversible 
methods of contraception. After approximately 3,000 initial 
Z-CAN visits, 96% of patients have received same-day contra-
ceptive services, and 64% have chosen a long acting reversible 
contraceptive method. On August 2, 2016, CDC published a 
review of contraception use among women of reproductive age 
at risk for unintended pregnancy in states at potential risk for 
local Zika transmission; the review identified barriers to the use 
of highly effective contraception and described key strategies 
states can implement to increase access to contraception during 
periods of local Zika virus transmission (35).
9. Implementing Vector Control Strategies and 
Building the Evidence Base for Best Practices
Successful control of Aedes aegypti, the primary mosquito 
vector of Zika virus, has proven extremely difficult using exist-
ing control methods. CDC’s technical assistance during the 
Zika response has therefore included support for improved 
mosquito control infrastructure, novel mosquito control 
techniques, and integrated vector management that uses exist-
ing control methods. During the Zika virus outbreak in the 
Wynwood neighborhood of Miami-Dade County, Florida, 
aggressive ground-based integrated vector management was 
* Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Trioplex real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (Trioplex).

supplemented by sequential aerial applications of adulticide 
and larvicide, which rapidly reduced adult mosquito counts 
in surveillance traps by approximately 90% and helped to end 
this local outbreak (36). A similar approach in Miami Beach, 
Florida, using aerial applications of adulticide and ground-
based applications of larvicide, also substantially reduced 
adult mosquito counts. Recent advances in aerial insecticide 
application methods, and the fact that, in the continental 
United States, Aedes aegypti lives primarily outdoors, likely 
contributed to the success of the aerial approach in Miami-
Dade County. Public opposition to aerial pesticide application 
in Puerto Rico precluded a similar approach there; instead, 
lethal mosquito traps have been deployed as part of large com-
munity trials that aim to evaluate this method of preventing 
future outbreaks of mosquito-borne disease on the island (37).
10. Improving Understanding of the Link 
Between Guillain-Barré Syndrome and 
Zika Virus Infection
Many countries have reported increases in the occurrence of 
severe neurologic illness, particularly Guillain-Barré syndrome 
(GBS), after Zika virus outbreaks, with reported rates two to 
10 times higher than those reported before Zika virus disease 
outbreaks (38–40). During the past year, the Puerto Rico 
Department of Health and CDC established an enhanced 
surveillance system for GBS in Puerto Rico. Initial analyses 
have demonstrated that among 56 patients with suspected 
GBS during January 1–July 31, 2016, a total of 26 (47%) 
had confirmed (n = 10, 18%) or presumptive (16, 29%) Zika 
virus infection (41). Other work related to GBS includes ret-
rospective case-control investigations in Puerto Rico, Brazil, 
and Colombia, which will help improve understanding of the 
association between Zika virus infection and GBS.
Future Priorities
Zika virus remains a serious threat to world health that is 
likely to continue until a safe and effective vaccine becomes 
available and is widely implemented. Threats from mosquito-
borne infection are likely to continue until better vector control 
interventions are developed. The severe consequences of Zika 
virus infection require a long-term approach with dedicated 
resources (42). Important future priorities include continuing 
to protect pregnant women and fetuses and infants from Zika 
virus infection; developing improved diagnostics, including 
the ability to distinguish among flaviviruses serologically; 
collaborating among government and private partners to 
accelerate vaccine development; developing and implementing 
improved vector surveillance and control strategies and capaci-
ties; improving contraceptive access to reduce unintended 
pregnancies; and improving understanding of the long-term 
outcomes for infants exposed to Zika virus in utero. Much 
remains to be done to protect pregnant women and fetuses and 
infants from Zika virus infection; the rapid action, dedication, 
and collaboration demonstrated by the global public health 
community during the past year provide a solid foundation 
for future work.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
The introduction of Zika virus into the Region of the Americas 
and the subsequent increase in cases of congenital micro-
cephaly resulted in activation of CDC’s Emergency Operations 
Center and the declaration of a Public Health Emergency of 
International Concern by the World Health Organization. As of 
December 15, 2016, 61 countries and territories have reported 
local Zika virus transmission as part of the current outbreak; 
29 countries and territories have reported potential cases of 
congenital Zika syndrome.
What is added by this report?
CDC’s emergency response to Zika virus rapidly addressed many 
acute public health needs associated with the outbreak and 
developed new public health surveillance and infection control 
tools, including issuing travel and clinical guidance; identify-
ing sexual transmission; monitoring blood safety; developing 
and distributing laboratory test kits; establishing the causal link 
between in utero infection and congenital Zika syndrome and 
assessing the range of outcomes and the magnitude of risk; 
improving access to contraception to prevent unintended preg-
nancies; implementing vector control strategies; and improving 
the understanding of the link between and Zika virus infection 
and other neurological illnesses.
What are the implications for public health practice?
To protect pregnant women and their fetuses and infants from 
the effects of Zika virus infection during pregnancy, public 
health activities must focus on preventing mosquito-borne 
transmission through vector control and personal protective 
practices, preventing sexual transmission by advising absten-
tion from sex or consistent and correct use of condoms, and 
preventing unintended pregnancies by reducing barriers to 
access to highly effective reversible contraception. Collectively, 
these critical strategies can reduce the effect of the virus on 
infants, families, and communities.
