Compared to female major depressive disorder (MDD), male MDD often receives less 
attention. However, research is warranted since there are significant sex differences in the 
clinical presentation of MDD and a higher rate of suicide in depressed men. To the best 
of our knowledge, this is the first functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study 
with a large sample addressing putative sex differences in MDD during adolescence, 
a period when one of the most robust findings in psychiatric epidemiology emerges; 
that females are twice as likely to suffer from MDD than males. Twenty-four depressed 
and 10 healthy male adolescents, together with 82 depressed and 24 healthy female 
adolescents, aged 11–18 years, undertook an affective go/no-go task during fMRI 
acquisition. In response to sad relative to neutral distractors, significant sex differences 
(in the supramarginal gyrus) and group-by-sex interactions (in the supramarginal gyrus 
and the posterior cingulate cortex) were found. Furthermore, in contrast to the healthy 
male adolescents, depressed male adolescents showed decreased activation in the cer-
ebellum with a significant group-by-age interaction in connectivity. Future research may 
consider altered developmental trajectories and the possible implications of sex-specific 
treatment and prevention strategies for MDD.

sex Differences in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)
The incidence of MDD for girls rises from age 11 to 13 years until by age 15 one of the most robust 
findings in psychiatric epidemiology emerges; that females are twice as likely to suffer from MDD 
than males (although this predominance might disappear after age 55 years) (1). Possible explanations

for sex differences in the incidence of adolescent MDD include: 
girls having more negative thinking styles, ruminating on inter-
personal and body image events, having greater hormone fluctua-
tions, reporting more negative events and sexual abuse, a higher 
vulnerability to inflammation (2), and estrogen-induced stress 
response enhancement of the prefrontal cortex (3). The genetic 
risk for MDD also differs strikingly between sexes with more 
heritability in women (4). In terms of other risk factors, social 
stress is closely related to female MDD, whereas low self-esteem is 
more likely to be related to male MDD (5). Furthermore, looking 
after small children is associated with greater risk of MDD in 
women (6) whereas men are more sensitive to the depressogenic 
effects of divorce, separation, and occupational problems (7). 
Consequently, research into MDD occurring at this early stage of 
adolescence avoids these complicating social factors.
Despite strong evidence suggesting poor outcomes, male 
MDD is underrepresented in the extant literature. Men are more 
liable to persistent depression whereas women tend to suffer from 
a more episodic disorder (8). Depressed men are also more likely 
to commit suicide (9) and abuse substances (10) than depressed 
women. Suicidal attempts and substance abuse have been related 
to poor cognitive control (11, 12). Significant sex differences 
have been found in the cognitive control of emotion (13). Taken 
together, exploration of cognitive control, and especially of emo-
tional cognitive control, might facilitate an understanding of sex 
differences in MDD.
cognitive control in MDD
Cognitive control can be defined as neurocognitive processes 
important for achieving goals, particularly when adaptive adjust-
ment is needed in response to changing environmental demands 
(14). The possible causal relationship between impaired cogni-
tive control and MDD was proposed as early as Beck’s Cognitive 
Theory of Depression in 1979 (15). Indeed, impaired cognitive 
control has been associated with the vulnerability, onset, and 
maintenance of MDD (16). It has also been suggested that persist-
ing cognitive deficits lead to poor psychosocial functioning and 
hence poor quality of life in remitted depressed patients.
This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging 
(fMRI) to explore cognitive control among emotional distrac-
tions during a widely used affective go/no-go (AGNG) task. In 
this task, participants responded by button press to target (“go”) 
stimuli that were emotionally valent (e.g., sad) while inhibit-
ing their response to distractor (“no-go”) stimuli of a different 
valence (e.g., happy). The cingulate, inferior frontal gyrus, and 
insula cortex are most frequently activated during the inhibi-
tion of emotional distractors in the AGNG task (17–25). These 
three regions are also commonly reported in non-affective go/
no-go studies when comparing no-go and go events (26–30) with 
additional regions such as the middle temporal gyrus, cerebellum 
and the striatum frequently reported in adolescents (24, 31–36).
Compared to healthy adults, depressed adults show increased 
activation in the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex and bilateral 
anterior temporal cortex in response to sad versus neutral dis-
tractors (37) which indicates an activation bias toward negative 
information. Nevertheless, our recently published study using 
the same task found aberrant brain activation in the orbitofrontal 
cortex of female adolescents with MDD in response to the happy 
versus neutral distractors (38). Consequently, it is not clear 
whether happy, sad, or both distractors elicit aberrant brain 
responses in adolescents with MDD.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fMRI study spe-
cifically addressing aberrancy in brain activation in males with 
MDD, and sex differences in cognitive control in adolescents with 
MDD. It was hypothesized that there would be a significant sex 
difference in brain activation associated with cognitive control 
in the affected group. Despite using an uncorrected statistical 
threshold, a previous fMRI study located the sex differences in 
cognitive control responding to negative stimuli to the supramar-
ginal gyrus, amygdala, and orbitofrontal cortex (13). Interestingly, 
these regions are also among the core areas of pathology of MDD 
according to Mayberg’s limbic-cortical dysregulation model (39). 
Sex differences in cognitive control in depressed patients would 
help to explain the difference in the manifestation of MDD in 
males and females. Specifically, we hypothesized that group-
by-sex interactions in brain activation subserving emotional 
cognitive control would be found in the aforementioned brain 
regions: the supramarginal gyrus, amygdala, and orbitofrontal 
cortex. However, given the lack of previous studies, we conducted 
whole-brain analysis to identify patterns of task-induced activity 
and then tested for group-by-sex interactions in those regions. 
Initially, all participants were investigated, followed by an analysis 
in male participants alone. Results from the female participants 
alone have been published elsewhere (38).
MaTerials anD MeThODs
Participants
Patients with a diagnosis of MDD were recruited from the 
Improving Mood with Psychoanalytic and Cognitive Therapies 
(IMPACT), a pragmatic effectiveness clinical trial (40) in East 
Anglia, North London, and North West England, with patients 
randomized to one of three different treatment arms to determine 
the short-to-medium term efficacy of conversational therapies. A 
subsample of patients from the East Anglia region were invited 
to participate in an adjunctive study, MR-IMPACT, aimed at 
exploring the neural mechanisms underlying MDD and recovery 
following treatment using MRI (41). Healthy control participants 
matched for age, sex, and handedness were also recruited in the 
MR-IMPACT study (41). Randomization was first performed in 
patients, then MRI neural images were taken, which were fol-
lowed by conversational therapies.
General inclusion criteria for patients in the IMPACT 
trial (40) and MR-IMPACT study (41) were: aged 11 through 
17 years; diagnosis of current moderate-to-severe Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) MDD, as deter-
mined by patient and parent interviews with the Kiddie Schedule 
for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime 
version; and score of 27 or above on the self-reported Moods and 
Feelings Questionnaire (42). Exclusion criteria for the IMPACT 
trial (40) included: generalized learning difficulties; pervasive 
developmental disorder; bipolar I disorder; schizophrenia; eating 
disorder; pregnancy; and currently taking a medication that may 
 FigUre 1 | The inter-block interval was 12 s with the first 4 s of each block 
used to present the instructions (in this case, “Press for happy words. Ignore 
sad words.”). Each word was presented for 450 ms with a 750 ms 
interstimulus interval. Participants were asked to press a button when 
presented with a target word (in this case, happy words) and inhibit 
responses to distractor words (in this case, sad words).

interact with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Additional 
exclusion criteria of the MR-IMPACT study for all participants 
(i.e., including controls) were as follows: alcohol dependence; 
drug dependence; MRI contraindication; brain abnormality; and 
intolerance to the MRI environment (41).
Overall, 126 patients and 40 controls participated in the 
study. Ninety-four female patients and 29 female controls were 
enrolled, although some participants were subsequently excluded 
from the analysis for the following reasons: brain abnormality (1 
patient), dental braces (7 patients and 2 controls), schizophrenia 
comorbidity (1 patient), excessive (>3 SDs) motion during fMRI 
scanning (1 patient and 2 controls), and poor (>3 SDs) behavioral 
performance on the AGNG task (2 patients and 1 control). Thirty-
two male patients and 11 male controls were enrolled. Similarly, 
some male participants were excluded for the following reasons: 
brain abnormality (one patient and one control), dental braces 
(three patients), schizophrenia comorbidity (two patients), exces-
sive motion during scanning (one patient), and poor behavioral 
performance on the AGNG task (one patient). Overall, 82 female 
patients and 24 female controls along with 24 male patients 
and 10 male controls were included in the analysis. The study 
was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki 
(https://www.wma.net/what-we-do/medical-ethics/declaration-
of-helsinki/). Ethical approval was given by the Cambridgeshire 2 
Research Ethics Committee, UK (REC reference: 09/H0308/168).
As the study recruited participants through a pragmatic 
effectiveness trial, more women than men were enrolled in this 
study resulting in an unbalanced design with restricted power for 
addressing sex effects. Likewise, the number of male relative to 
female controls enrolled was fewer.
affective go/no-go Task
Happy, sad, and neutral words were presented to participants 
during fMRI data acquisition using a block paradigm task design 
(37) (Figure 1). Words did not differ in terms of length or usage 
frequency (43). There were seven types of blocks each repeating 
three times, consisting of randomly ordered targets/distractors 
(10 of each type): sad/neutral (SN), sad/happy (SH), neutral/
sad, neutral/happy, happy/sad (HS), happy/neutral (HN), and 
neutral italic/plain. Equal numbers of happy and sad words were 
used with mood induction unlikely to occur. As a result, neural 
responses of the participants were likely to be related to cognitive 
control instead of affective response. The inter-block interval was 
12 s with the first 4 s of each block used to present the instruc-
tions for that block. Each word was presented for 450 ms with 
a 750 ms interstimulus interval (41). Participants were asked to 
press a button with their right index finger when presented with 
a target word (“go”) and to inhibit responses to distractor words 
(“no-go”). All participants completed a go/no-go practice task 
(living versus non-living stimuli) prior to scanning. The following 
analyses were based on two contrasts: a happy distractor contrast 
(SH–SN) and a sad distractor contrast (HS–HN) with targets fixed 
and distractors differing in valence.
Behavioral Data analysis
Behavioral output tailored to the happy distractor contrast and 
the sad distractor contrast was recorded to capture three variables: 
mean response time of correct go, incorrect go (omission error), 
and incorrect no-go (commission error). For instance, mean 
response time of the sad distractor contrast was defined as the 
mean reaction time of the HS condition minus the mean reaction 
time of the HN condition. Likewise, omission error of the happy 
distractor contrast was defined as the number of the omission 
errors in the SH condition minus the number of the omission 
errors in the SN condition. The timing of responses was measured 
when participants released the button. Analysis of covariance 
was performed in SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Science, 
version 21) on the behavioral measures, with group (depressed/
healthy) and sex as independent variables, and age as a covariate. 
Group, sex, and age effects, as well as group-by-sex and group-
by-age interactions were then explored in a single model with a 
statistical threshold for significance of p < 0.05.
fMri analysis
fMRI Data Acquisition
Participants were scanned on a 3-T Magnetom Trio Tim MRI 
scanner (Siemens, Surrey, England) at the Wolfson Brain Imaging 
Centre, University of Cambridge, UK. Thirty-two slices of data 
parallel to the anterior–posterior commissure comprised each 
three-dimensional volume acquired continuously during the task. 
Acquisition parameters were: echo time, TE = 30 ms; repetition 
time, TR = 2 s; flip angle = 78°; field of view = 192 mm × 120 mm; 
and 3.0 mm × 3.0 mm × 3.0 mm voxel size with an interleaved 
slice acquisition (41).

Within-Subject fMRI Data Preprocessing
Imaging data were preprocessed with FEAT (FMRI Expert 
Analysis Tool, version 6.00) in FSL 5.0.6 (FMRIB’s Software 
Library, www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl). Participant head motion was 
corrected with MCFLIRT (Motion Correction FMRIB’s Linear 
Image Registration Tool) (44), interleaved slice timing was 
corrected with Fourier-space time-series phase-shifting, non-
brain tissue was removed by Brain Extraction Tool (45), spatial 
smoothing was performed with a Gaussian kernel of FWHM 
6 mm, grand-mean intensity of data was normalized by a single 
multiplicative factor, and high-pass temporal filtering with 90 s 
cutoff was performed.
Between-Subject fMRI Data Analysis
Following initial within-subject (first level) analysis to gener-
ate z-statistic maps, all maps were normalized to the standard 
Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space (46) by FLIRT 
(FMRIB’s Linear Image Registration Tool) (44, 47).
To accommodate the possibility of unequal variances between 
males and females due to the unbalanced design, we used the 
Aspin–Welch statistic and permutation inference, as implemented 
in the tool Permutation Analysis of Linear Models (PALM), part 
of the FSL package (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/PALM) 
(48).
With all participants, a whole-brain Aspin–Welch unequal 
variance test controlling for age determined significant mean 
activation and deactivation patterns of the two contrasts such that 
for the happy (or sad) distractor contrast, the activation pattern 
referred to the brain regions more activated to the SH (or HS) 
condition than the SN (or HN) condition, and the deactivation 
pattern referred to the brain regions more activated to the SN 
(or HN) condition than the SH (or HS) condition. Subsequent 
between-subject analysis was restricted to these mean activated 
or deactivated regions. The Aspin–Welch unequal variance test 
was then performed with group (depressed/healthy) and sex as 
independent variables, and age as a covariate. Group, sex, and 
age effects as well as group-by-sex and group-by-age interactions 
were examined. Significant statistical results were identified using 
threshold-free cluster enhancement at a threshold of p < 0.05, 
family-wise error rate corrected.
To explore the aberrancy of activation within male participants, 
data were subsequently analyzed solely in male participants. 
Since patients and controls did not differ much in sample size, 
Aspin–Welch unequal variance test was not used in this analysis. 
Instead, FEAT with FLAME (FMRIB’s Local Analysis of Mixed 
Effects) was used in a whole-brain one-sample t-test controlling 
for age, to determine significant patterns of mean activation 
and deactivation. Then, restricting the analysis to these mean 
activated or deactivated regions, group effects controlling for age 
were explored. Again, significant statistical results were obtained 
using TFCE at a threshold of p < 0.05, family-wise error rate 
corrected.
Psychophysiological interactions (PPis)
Psychophysiological interaction analysis identifies regions that 
increase their connectivity with a seed region of interest during 
task performance (49). That is, using the fMRI data with a seed 
region specified, PPI detects brain areas whose activity depends on 
an interaction between a psychological factor (task performance) 
and physiological factor (time course of the seed region) (49).
For consistency with univariate approaches, regions show-
ing significant group effects in between-subject fMRI analyses 
were used as seeds. First, this seed region was transformed 
into the individual fMRI acquisition space of each participant 
using FNIRT (FMRIB’s non-linear image registration tool). It is 
likely that the significant group effect might reside in a relative 
small region compared to the whole-brain. The precision of this 
transformation in such a small region is critical to the following 
analyses, and thus non-linear (FNIRT) instead of linear (FLIRT) 
transformation was used to ensure sufficient deformation (http://
fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FNIRT) at the cost of computation 
time. The time course of the transformed region was extracted 
from each individual dataset.
Second, within-subject analysis was carried out with the time 
course extracted from the seed as a factor denoted “physiological 
regressor.” The happy distractor contrast and the sad distractor 
contrast denoted the “psychological regressors.” The interaction 
between the physiological and psychological regressors was then 
defined as the PPI. Finally, a between-subject FEAT analysis 
was performed with group effects, age effects, and the group-
by-age interactions examined. Significant statistical results were 
obtained using TFCE at a threshold of p < 0.05, family-wise error 
rate corrected.
resUlTs
Demographic and Behavioral results
There were no significant sex differences in demographic and 
behavioral characteristics (age, intelligence, handedness, trait 
anxiety, MDD severity, number of commission errors, number 
of omission errors, reaction time) with the exception that 
female adolescents had higher levels of state anxiety than male 
adolescents (Table 1). There were no significant sex differences 
 
(t/df/p = 1.50/34/0.142) in antidepressant usage (mean fluoxetine 
equivalent dose × duration): 19.52 mg × 2.43 months in girls and 
18.41 mg × 1.34 months in boys. There was a significant age effect 
[F(1, 134) = 5.250, p = 0.024] with older participants taking a 
longer time to respond to the happy targets (in the sad distractor 
contrast, i.e., during the sad versus neutral distractors) (Table 2; 
Figure 2).
results from the analysis of all 
Participants
No significant within-group mean activations or deactivations 
were found in response to the happy distractor contrast suggesting 
similar brain activation patterns occurring for happy compared 
to neutral distractors. In response to the sad distractor contrast, 
significant within-group mean activation occurred in regions of 
posterior cingulate, supramarginal gyrus and dorsolateral pre-
frontal cortex, similar to the well-acknowledged frontoparietal 
activated region in the go/no-go task (50). No significant mean 
deactivation regions were identified (Table 3; Figure 3).
 FigUre 2 | Older participants had longer reaction times responding to the 
sad distractor contrast. There were no significant group (depressed/healthy) 
or sex effects. Female patients, female controls, male patients, and male 
controls all showed similar patterns.

Neural Sex Difference in Adolescent Depression

Using PALM and restricting the analysis to the mean activa-
tion regions described above did not reveal any significant group, 
age effects, or group-by-age interactions. Consequently, despite 
the longer reaction times found in the older participants, their 
brain activation did not differ significantly from the younger par-
ticipants. A significant sex effect was found in the supramarginal 
gyrus, and significant group-by-sex interactions were found in the 
supramarginal gyrus and posterior cingulate (Table 3; Figure 3). 
Mean percent signal changes were then extracted from regions 
with significant results. Post hoc inspection of the extracted data 
revealed that the reductions in activation in males with MDD 
relative to healthy male adolescents were driving the majority of 
the significant group × sex interaction results (Figure 3; Table 4). 
Although there was a significant sex difference in STAI-S state 
anxiety (Table 1), no significant correlations between STAI-S and 
these percent signal changes were found.
Brain activation in Male Participants
There were no significant within-group mean activation or deac-
tivations for the happy distractor contrast. However, significant 
mean activations were found in the frontal pole, middle frontal 
gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and the cerebellum 
responding to the sad distractor contrast. Within these mean acti-
vation regions, male adolescents with MDD were found to exhibit 
lower brain activations than healthy male adolescents in the Crus 
I and Crus II regions of the cerebellum (Table 5; Figure 4).
PPi analysis of Male Participants
As the cerebellum was found to show a significant group differ-
ence, this region was chosen as a seed region for the PPI analysis.

No significant group or age effects were found. However, there 
was a significant group-by-age interaction between the cerebel-
lum seed and the superior frontal gyrus (Table 5; Figure 5). The 
PPI effect showed that compared with younger participants, 
connectivity between the cerebellum and superior frontal gyrus 
increased in strength across age in male controls, but decreased 
in strength with age in males with MDD (Figure 5). Taken 
together, differential functional responses associated with MDD 
and age-related changes of brain connectivity were found in the 
cerebellum of male adolescents.
All of the significant results identified in the primary analysis 
were checked for medication effects by t-tests between the group 
of patients using antidepressants (n = 36) and the group of 
patients not using antidepressants (n = 70). t-Statistics, p values, 
means, and SDs associated with these tests are shown in the Table 
S1 in Supplementary Material. Patients with and without antide-
pressant usage did not differ significantly in terms of behavior or 
brain activation.
DiscUssiOn
In response to the sad distractor contrast, significant sex differ-
ences (in the supramarginal gyrus), group-by-sex interactions 
(in the supramarginal gyrus and the PCC) and group differences 
in males (cerebellum) were found. Furthermore, a significant 
group-by-age interaction in connectivity between the cerebellum 
and superior frontal gyrus was observed.
response to the happy Targets intermixed 
with the sad versus neutral Distractors
Results from a previous study using an affective go/no-go task 
suggests that there is no significant developmental change of the 
reaction time difference between the negative image distractors 
and the positive or neutral images in the age range of 11–25 years 
(51). However, another go/no-go overlap task reports significant 
reaction time differences between fearful face distractors and 
happy or neutral face distractors in younger adolescents (11- to 
12-year olds) which diminished in older adolescents (17- to 
18-year olds) (52). Our data instead associated increased age with 
greater response time differences toward the sad versus neutral 
word distractors (in the sad distractor contrast, HS–HN) (Table 2; 
Figure 2). This inconsistency could be related to the fact that neu-
tral targets were used in the previous two studies whereas happy 
targets were used in our work. Furthermore, all three studies used 
cross-sectional designs. Future research is warranted before these 
results can be comprehensively interpreted.
interaction effect regions: The 
supramarginal gyrus
The supramarginal gyrus is located within the inferior parietal 
lobe, a region thought to be involved in attention, processing 
of written language, and working memory of emotional stimuli 
(53). Several studies suggest a relationship between MDD and 
supramarginal gyrus (54, 55). A meta-analysis indicates aberrant 
supramarginal gyrus activation toward positive emotional stimuli 
associated with MDD (54). Furthermore, aberrant connectivity 
has been shown between the medial prefrontal cortex and the 
supramarginal gyrus in adolescents with MDD (55).
Compared with women, men have larger total volume of the 
inferior parietal lobule (supramarginal gyrus and angular gyrus) 
(56). There is also evidence of sex differences in supramarginal 
gyrus function. Higher regional homogeneity (ReHo) of the 
fMRI time series in the supramarginal gyrus has been reported in 
female compared to male adults (57). In the supramarginal gyrus, 
men also show higher activation in response to negative words and 
lower activation in response to positive words as compared with 
women (58). Moreover, compared to women, hyperactivation 
of the supramarginal gyrus has been found during the cognitive 
control of negative stimuli in men (13). Our finding of a sex effect 
and group-by-sex interaction in the supramarginal gyrus extends 
these previous results and highlights the supra marginal gurus as 
a potentially key region contributing to sex differences in MDD.

interaction effect regions: The Pcc
The PCC is involved in risky decision-making (59), daydreaming, 
autobiographical memory, attention, and conscious awareness 
(60). This study showed a significant group-by-sex interaction in 
PCC. Previous literature has associated the PCC with MDD and 
sex effects; an overactive PCC has been observed in treatment-
resistant adult MDD (60), and a meta-analysis also demonstrates 
that men have larger gray matter volume in the PCC as compared 
to women (61). However, to the best of our knowledge, no previ-
ous study has addressed the group-by-sex interaction in PCC.
cerebellar Dysfunction in Males with MDD
Although initially considered as a motor coordinator, the cerebel-
lum is now known to play a role in emotional regulation and 
cognition, supported by its widespread connections to the limbic 
system, the frontal, parietal, prefrontal, occipital, and temporal 
cortex. The cerebellum is activated in a variety of mental activi-
ties, including facial recognition, emotion attribution, theory of 
mind attributions, directed attention, memory, and empathy (62, 
63) and has been referred to as the “emotional pacemaker” (64). 
Indeed, the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome following 
posterior cerebellar lobe lesion includes negative symptoms such 
as passivity, blunted affect, and withdrawal. In an early PET study, 
Dolan et al. reported increased regional cerebral blood flow of 
the cerebellar vermis in depressed adult patients with cognitive 
disturbance (65). Furthermore, in an fMRI meta-analysis, the 
cerebellum has been identified as an important area of dysfunc-
tion in MDD (66). Other meta-analyses suggest decreased ReHo 
in the left cerebellum (67) and aberrant cerebellar activation 
toward positive and negative emotional stimuli in MDD (54).
It has been proposed that the relatively protracted developmen-
tal course of the cerebellum may be associated with its vulnerability 
to the effects of mental disorders (68). A developmental difference 
exists between sexes with the total cerebellum volume peaks at age 
15.6 years in boys in contrast to 11.8 years in girls (68). A prior 
study showed hyperactivation of the cerebellum in response to 
the positive stimuli in depressed compared to healthy adolescents 
(69). Another study demonstrated aberrant activation of the cer-
ebellum responding to the negative distractor in adolescents with 
family history of MDD when compared to healthy controls (70). 
Similarly, we have identified hypoactive cerebellum responding to 
the sad distractor contrast in male adolescents with MDD.
We demonstrated a significant group-by-age interaction of the 
connectivity between cerebellum Crus I, Crus II, and the superior 
frontal gyrus in male adolescents. Superior frontal gyrus along 
with Crus I and Crus II of the cerebellum (71) is part of the default 
network. Indeed, a meta-analysis supports the importance of the 
aberrant resting-state connectivity between the cerebellum and 
other default network regions responsible for internally oriented 
and self-referential thinking in MDD (mean age 37.77 years old) 
(72). Examples include: higher resting-state connectivity between 
cerebellum and middle temporal gyrus (73, 74), and between the 
cerebellum and superior temporal pole (75). A multivariate pat-
tern analysis also suggested that the resting-state connection of the 
cerebellum is among the most discriminating regions separating 
healthy from depressed adults (75). To the best of our knowledge, 
there is no longitudinal study addressing the interaction between 
the connectivity of the cerebellum and development. However, 
similar to adult MDD, fronto-cerebellar dysregulation has been 
hypothesized to be a pathophysiological mechanism of adoles-
cent MDD (69). Aberrant resting-state connectivity between 
the cerebellum and other default network regions has also been 
found in geriatric MDD (76). The developmental trajectory of the 
connections in the cerebellum awaits further exploration.
limitations
Reflecting the skewed prevalence of MDD, the sample size of the 
male patient group was relatively limited. Furthermore, the num-
ber of males in the control group was also limited. Presumably, 
the restricted number of males might be related to the failure to 
find significant group-by-sex interactions in the amygdala and

control difference of these mean activation regions (e). A box plot showed higher brain activation (extracted percent signal change) in the male controls’ cerebellum 
when compared with the male patients.

orbitofrontal cortex as hypothesized. Future studies examining 
sex differences in adolescent MDD with larger male control groups 
are needed. Since our significant results were not all hypothesized 
(e.g., cerebellum), they should be considered preliminary until 
replicated. Furthermore, although alcohol and drug dependence 
were among the exclusion criteria, we were unable to explore the 
possible confounding effects of alcohol and drug since details of 
frequency or severity of usage were not recorded.

Most of the significant findings in this study reside in the 
neuroimaging data, but not in the behavioral data. Our task was 
designed to be primarily sensitive to brain activation rather than 
to measure variability in behavior. Discrepancy between behav-
ioral performance and brain activations is frequently reported 
in the psychiatric fMRI literature, possibly related to the higher 
sensitivity of brain signals to detect case–control differences or 
alternative neural strategies to achieve comparable performances 
in the patient and control groups (38).
Finally, a cross-sectional design was used in this research and 
although we examine age effects and interactions, we cannot 
describe the developmental trajectory of our findings with the 
same confidence that could be drawn from a longitudinal study. 
Furthermore, we cannot exclude the potential effect of normal 
developmental sex differences in the cerebellum. Also, pubertal 
stage was not considered in the analysis. Future research should 
incorporate these factors into a longitudinal design.
Future research: The Default network
Although network inference was restricted by task design and the 
fact that the majority of the analyses were univariate in nature, 
the supramarginal gyrus, PCC, Crus I, and Crus II of the cer-
ebellum, and superior frontal gyrus all contribute to the default 
network. Indeed, aberrant brain activation of the default network 
toward negative pictures has been found with an increase of self-
referential focus in MDD (77). Current research also indirectly 
indicates the importance of default network in the sex differences 
in MDD. First, men are found to be more liable to persistent MDD 
whereas women are more likely to suffer from episodic MDD (8). 
Furthermore, it has been proposed that the default network acts 
as an overarching mechanism for the impaired cognitive control 
of recurrent MDD (78). Second, the default network has been 
regarded as the key to cognitive decline in MDD (79) with men 
more liable to the cognitive effects of the disorder leading to 
dementia (80, 81). Future research might consider using multi-
variate analysis to directly explore the relationship between the 
default network and sex differences in MDD.
cOnclUsiOn
Our study provides the first neuroimaging evidence of sex dif-
ferences observed with functional imaging in adolescent MDD. 
In response to sad relative to neutral distractors, group-by-sex 
interactions were found in the supramarginal gyrus and the PCC. 
In particular, novel aberrant brain activation in the cerebellum 
with a group-by-age interaction of its connectivity with the 
superior frontal gyrus was identified in male adolescents with 
MDD. Future research may explore the neural mechanisms of sex 
differences and their relationships with clinical symptomology.
