 Background—Excessive sedentary time is ubiquitous in Westernized societies. Previous studies 
have relied on self-report to evaluate the total volume of sedentary time as a prognostic risk factor 
for mortality and have not examined whether the manner in which sedentary time is accrued (in 
short or long bouts) carries prognostic relevance.
Objective—To examine the association of objectively-measured sedentary behavior (its total 
volume and accrual in prolonged, uninterrupted bouts) with all-cause mortality.
Design—Prospective cohort study.
Setting—Contiguous United States
Participants—7,985 black and white adults ≥45 years.
Measurements—Sedentary time was measured using a hip-mounted accelerometer. Prolonged, 
uninterrupted sedentariness was expressed as mean sedentary bout length. Hazard ratios [HRs] 
were calculated comparing quartiles 2-4 to quartile 1 for each exposure (quartile cutpoints: 689.7, 
746.5, and 799.4 min/day for total sedentary time; 7.7, 9.6, and 12.4 min/bout for sedentary bout 
duration) in models that included moderate-vigorous physical activity.
Results—Over a median follow-up of 4.0 years, there were 340 deaths. In multivariable adjusted 
models, greater total sedentary time (HR [95% CI]: 1.22 [0.74-2.02], 1.61 [0.99-2.63], and 2.63 
[1.60-4.30]; P-trend <0.001) and longer sedentary bout duration (HR [95% CI]: 1.03 [0.67-1.60], 
1.22 [0.80-1.85], and 1.96 [1.31-2.93]; P-trend <0.001) were each associated with a higher all-
cause mortality risk. Evaluation of their joint association showed that participants classified as 
high for both sedentary characteristics (e.g. high sedentary time [≥12.5 h/day] and high bout 
duration [≥10 min/bout]) had the highest morality risk.
Limitations—Participants may not be representative of the general US population.
Conclusions—The total volume of sedentary time as well as how one accrues sedentary time are 
both associated with all-cause mortality; suggestive that physical activity guidelines should target 
reducing and interrupting sedentary time to reduce mortality risk.

INTRODUCTION
Adults spend an alarming 9-10 hours/day sedentary.(1) Accordingly, the phrase “sitting is 
the new smoking” has been coined by popular press to describe a current epidemic of 
developed nations.(2–4) Evidence indicates sedentary time is associated with incident 
cardiovascular disease (CVD), incidence of CVD-related risk factors, and mortality.(5, 6) 
Importantly, the risk conferred by prolonged sedentariness is eliminated only with high 
levels of moderate-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA, ~60-75 min/day) which 
exceed physical activity recommendations.(7, 8) As such, sedentary behavior is now thought 
to represent a clinically important aspect of an individual’s physical activity profile and is no 
longer considered simply to be the extreme low end of the physical activity continuum.(5)
Studies linking sedentary behavior to health outcomes have relied almost exclusively on 
self-reported sedentary time – methodology subject to reporting bias and measurement error.

 objectively-measured sedentary time with health outcomes;(5) a study (the National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES]) limited by a small event rate.(10) New 
studies utilizing NHANES data have since been published with longer follow-up and higher 
event rates.(11–15) However, conflicting results have been reported as objectively-measured 
sedentary time was associated with mortality in some studies,(11, 14, 15) but not others.(12, 
13) Additional cohort studies are thus needed to rectify evidence gaps. Furthermore, studies 
utilizing accelerometers to objectively measure sedentary behavior conventionally 
operationalize sedentary time as the total number of minutes/day. This approach ignores 
patterns of accumulated sedentary behavior over time. For example, accumulation of 
sedentary time in a few long bouts or many short bouts represents two distinct patterns of 
sedentary time accrual. Experimental studies have demonstrated that acute periods of 
prolonged, uninterrupted sedentary behavior elicit greater detrimental cardio-metabolic 
effects compared to sedentary behavior that is periodically interrupted,(16–18) suggestive 
that it is not just total sedentary time that is relevant to health outcomes, but also the manner 
in which it is accumulated. Few longitudinal studies, however, have explored the association 
of prolonged uninterrupted sedentary behavior with morality to corroborate these findings.
To inform physical activity guidelines regarding how to reduce sedentary behavior (e.g. 
target reductions in overall sedentary time; or target interrupting prolonged sedentary bouts), 
evidence from prospective studies is needed to (1) confirm the association of total sedentary 
time with mortality using objective measures, (2) determine if prolonged sedentary bouts 
confer mortality risk, and (3) elucidate whether total volume of sedentary time and its 
pattern of accumulation individually or jointly contribute to risk for mortality. The purpose 
of this study, therefore, was to examine the associations of objectively-measured sedentary 
time (both its total volume and accrual in prolonged bouts) with all-cause mortality in a 
national cohort of U.S. middle-aged and older adults enrolled in the Reasons for Geographic 
and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study.
METHODS
Study Population
REGARDS is a population-based study designed to examine racial and regional disparities 
in stroke. It is comprised of 30,239 white and black adults ≥45 years of age, enrolled 
between 2003 and 2007 from across the contiguous U.S.(19, 20) Detailed design and 
methods for REGARDS are described elsewhere.(21) Briefly, demographic and 
cardiovascular risk factor data were collected by telephone interview and an in-home 
physical assessment upon enrollment. A detailed summary of baseline measures is provided 
in the Appendix (available at www.annals.org). Participants (or their proxies) were then 
followed at 6-month intervals to ascertain vital status. Objective measurements of sedentary 
behavior were collected from active REGARDS participants from 2009 to 2013 (mean years 
from study enrollment: 5.7 years [standard deviation, SD: 1.5 years]; range: 1.9-9.5 years).
(22) A total of 7,985 participants provided compliant accelerometer wear (≥4 days with 
accelerometer wear ≥10 hours) and follow-up data and were available for the current 
analyses (Appendix Figure 1). Appendix Table 1 shows the characteristics of REGARDS

 participants who were included vs. excluded from the current analyses. All participants 
provided informed consent.
Accelerometer Data Collection
Methods for accelerometer data collection are described elsewhere.(22) Briefly, participants 
were fitted with an Actical™ (Respironics, Inc., Bend, OR) secured to their right hip using a 
nylon belt and were instructed to wear the device during waking hours for seven consecutive 
days. The Actical has been validated for measurement of physical activity and sedentary 
behavior and shown to have acceptable reliability.(23–25)
Activity counts were summed over 1-minute epochs. Non-wear periods were defined as 
≥150 consecutive minutes of 0 activity counts. This non-wear algorithm was previously 
validated against daily log sheets in REGARDS participants.(26) Counts of 0-49 counts per 
minute (cpm), 50-1064 cpm, and ≥1065 cpm distinguished sedentary behavior, light 
intensity physical activity (LIPA), and MVPA, respectively, as determined in a laboratory-
based calibration study.(27) A sedentary bout was defined as consecutive minutes in which 
the accelerometer registered <50 cpm. A sedentary break was defined as at least 1 minute in 
which counts registered ≥50 cpm after a sedentary bout. Both sedentary bouts and breaks 
were exclusively continuous periods with no interruptions or non-wear intervals allowed in 
the definition.
Outcome Ascertainment
All-cause mortality was the primary outcome, defined as any death after completion of the 
accelerometer protocol regardless of cause. Dates of death were confirmed through review 
of death certificates, medical records, and administrative databases. Deaths occurring 
through September 4, 2015 were included in the current analysis.
Statistical Analyses
Sedentary and physical activity variables were averaged across compliant days (≥10 hours of 
wear). Because of a high correlation between total sedentary time and wear time (Appendix 
Figure 2), we corrected for the influence of wear time by standardizing total sedentary time 
to 16 hours of wear time/day using the residuals obtained when regressing total sedentary 
time on wear time (see Appendix Methods).(28–30)
Participants were stratified into quartiles according to total sedentary time and, separately, 
mean sedentary bout duration (a measure of overall prolonged, uninterrupted sedentary 
behavior). Cox proportional-hazards regression modelling was used to calculate the hazard 
ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality associated with total sedentary time (and separately mean 
sedentary bout length) quartiles. Crude HRs were initially calculated. Subsequently, HRs 
were calculated with adjustment for age, race, sex, region of residence, education, and 
season the accelerometer was worn (Model 1), with further adjustment for current smoking, 
alcohol use, body mass index (BMI), diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 ml/min/1.73 m2, atrial fibrillation, history of coronary 
heart disease (CHD), and history of stroke (Model 2). Models were additionally adjusted for 
MVPA expressed continuously (Model 3). Tests for linear trend across quartiles were

 conducted by including the quartile for each participant as an ordinal variable in regression 
models. Proportional-hazards assumptions were confirmed with a Kolmogorov-type 
supremum test.(31) The above analyses were then repeated in a fully adjusted model testing 
interactions for age (<65 and ≥65 years), sex (male and female), race (black and white), BMI 
category (normal weight and overweight/obese), and MVPA category (<150 min/week and 
≥150 min/week).
As a secondary analysis, we examined the continuous dose-response relationship between 
each sedentary characteristic and all-cause mortality in a fully adjusted model (Model 3) 
using restricted cubic splines.(32) Cubic polynomials were fitted with the mean of each 
sedentary characteristic set as the reference and knots placed at the 5th, 35th, 65th, and 95th 
percentiles.(33) Non-linear associations were evaluated using the likelihood ratio test. For 
non-linear associations, spline models were used to describe the associations and when the 
association was determined to be linear, a linear model was used.
Because of multicollinearity between total sedentary time and mean sedentary bout duration 
(r=0.61), both variables were not included in the same model. Alternatively, to examine the 
individual and joint associations of total sedentary time and prolonged, uninterrupted 
sedentary behavior with mortality, participants were classified into four categories: low total 
sedentary time (<750 min/day) and low prolonged sedentary bout time (<10 min/bout), low 
total sedentary time and high prolonged sedentary bout time (≥10 min/bout), high total 
sedentary time (≥750 min/day) and low prolonged sedentary bout time, and high total 
sedentary time and high prolonged sedentary bout time. HRs for all-cause mortality were 
calculated for each joint category in comparison to the low/low group in a fully adjusted 
model (Model 3). Thresholds for total sedentary time (750 min/day) and mean sedentary 
bout duration (10 min) were selected on the basis of the restricted cubic splines and were 
confirmed using a method described by Contal and O’Quigley (see Appendix Methods).(34)
To allow for the possibility that sedentary bouts of a certain length may have greater or 
lesser association with mortality, the percent of total sedentary time accumulated in bouts of 
1-29, 30-59, 60-89, and ≥90 min was quantified. Participants were subsequently stratified 
into quartiles for each bout length. Analyses were then repeated testing associations of each 
sedentary bout threshold quartile with risk of all-cause mortality. To determine the bout 
length that confers the greatest mortality risk (as well as elucidate the risk associated with 
each bout length after accounting for one’s entire pattern of sedentary time accrual), models 
were mutually adjusted (e.g., all bout thresholds included in a single model) in a fourth 
model (Model 4).
As breaks in sedentary time have received interest as a potentially important adjunct to 
physical activity guidelines, as a tertiary analysis we also examined the association of 
sedentary break characteristics (total number, breaks/sedentary hour, break duration, and 
break intensity) with risk of all-cause mortality. To evaluate the potential for reverse 
causality, we conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding participants who died in the first 
year of follow-up. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess how substantial any 
unmeasured confounding would need to be to explain the observed associations.(35) 
Analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), with the PROC

RESULTS
Participant Characteristics
Sedentary behavior accounted for 77.4% (SD: 9.4) of wear time, equivalent to 12.3 (SD: 1.4) 
hours/day over a 16-hour waking day. Mean sedentary bout length was 11.4 (SD: 8.1) min/
bout. The percent of total sedentary time accumulated in bouts 0-29, 30-59, 60-89, and ≥90 
min was, on average, 52.0% (SD: 15.5), 22.1% (SD: 6.2), 11.8% (SD: 5.7), and 14.1% (SD: 
12.8), respectively.
Participant characteristics stratified by total sedentary time quartile are presented in Table 1. 
On average, participants with greater total sedentary time were older, more likely to be 
black, smoke, live in a non-stroke belt/buckle region, and have diabetes, hypertension, 
dyslipidemia, eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2, atrial fibrillation, history of CHD, and history of 
stroke. They were also less likely to be moderate or heavy drinkers, had greater BMI, and 
had lower levels of LIPA and MVPA. Participant characteristics stratified by mean sedentary 
bout length quartiles are presented in Table 2.
Total Sedentary Time, Sedentary Bout Length and All-Cause Mortality
There were 340 deaths over a median follow-up of 4.0 years (range 0.1 to 6.1 years). When 
expressed as quartiles, greater total sedentary time and longer mean sedentary bout duration 
were each dose-dependently associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality (Figure 1 
and Appendix Table 2). Adjustment for MVPA attenuated these associations, but all results 
remained statistically significant. The associations of total sedentary time and sedentary bout 
duration quartiles with all-cause mortality did not vary by age, sex, race, BMI, or MVPA 
category (interaction p-values >0.10; Appendix Figures 3 and 4).
Figure 2 shows the cubic splines for risk of all-cause mortality when total sedentary time 
and mean sedentary bout duration were expressed continuously. Total sedentary time was 
significantly associated with all-cause mortality in a linear, dose-dependent fashion (p-value 
for overall effect <0.001, p-value for non-linear relationship=0.70). In contrast, mean 
sedentary bout duration was significantly associated with all-cause mortality in a non-linear 
manner (p-value for overall effect <0.001, p-value for non-linear relationship <0.001). A 
marked increase in mortality risk was observed at ~10 min/bout; suggestive of a threshold 
effect.

 Joint Associations of Total Sedentary Time and Prolonged Sedentary Bouts with All-Cause 
Mortality
Figure 3 shows the joint associations of total sedentary time and sedentary bout length. 
Participants classified as high for both sedentary characteristics had the highest risk for all-
cause mortality (HR: 2.00 [95% CI: 1.45-2.75]; p<0.001). Participants classified into the 
high total sedentary time/ low sedentary bout duration group (HR: 1.68 [95% CI: 1.07-2.65]; 
p=0.026), but not those classified into the low total sedentary time/high sedentary bout 
duration group (HR: 1.19 [95% CI: 0.59-2.42]; p=0.62), also had a statistically significant 
increased risk for all-cause mortality.
Sedentary Bout Length Thresholds and All-Cause Mortality
Accumulating a greater percent of sedentary time in bouts of 1-29 min was associated with 
less of an increased risk for all-cause mortality (Figure 4 and Appendix Table 3) when 
expressed as quartiles. Conversely, accumulating a greater percent of sedentary time in bouts 
of 60-89 min and ≥90 min were associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality. To 
distinguish the sedentary bout duration that confers the greatest risk, models were mutually 
adjusted by including each sedentary bout threshold in a single model. After mutual 
adjustment, accumulating a greater percent of sedentary time in bouts of 1-29 min remained 
significantly associated with less of an increased risk of all-cause mortality. Accumulating a 
greater percent of sedentary time in bouts of 30-59, 60-89, and ≥90 min were not 
significantly associated with a greater risk of all-cause mortality after mutual adjustment. 
The associations of each sedentary bout threshold quartile with all-cause mortality did not 
vary by age, sex, race, BMI, or MVPA category (interaction p-values >0.10). All results 
were similar when sedentary bout thresholds were expressed continuously in restricted cubic 
splines; with linear relationships observed for all bout thresholds (Appendix Figure 5).
Tertiary and Sensitivity Analyses
In unadjusted and multivariable adjusted models, a higher number, longer duration, and 
greater intensity of sedentary breaks were each associated with a lower risk of all-cause 
mortality (Appendix Table 4).
In sensitivity analyses, we found no evidence of reverse causality after the exclusion of early 
deaths as the pattern of all results was similar (data not shown). We also investigated the 
effect of a simulated unmeasured confounder on risk for all-cause mortality. For an 
unmeasured confounder to bring the upper confidence limit of the uppermost total sedentary 
time quartile below 1.00, it would have to be associated with a 2.5 fold increased probability 
of being in the uppermost quartile and a 3.0-fold increase in risk for all-cause mortality. For 
an unmeasured confounder to bring the upper confidence limit of the uppermost mean 
sedentary bout duration quartile below 1.00, it would have to both increase the probability of 
being in the uppermost quartile and increase risk for all-cause mortality by 2.0 fold.
DISCUSSION
In this prospective study of a U.S. national cohort of middle- and older-aged adults, both 
total sedentary time and prolonged, uninterrupted sedentary bouts were associated with an

 increased risk for all-cause mortality. These associations were independent of MVPA and 
cardiovascular risk factors (albeit with some attenuation in risk estimates). When the joint 
associations of both sedentary characteristics were evaluated, high total sedentary time and 
high sedentary bout duration together were associated with the highest risk for all-cause 
mortality (e.g. high total sedentary time and high sedentary bout duration). These findings 
highlight the importance of the total volume of sedentary time and its accumulation in 
prolonged bouts as important health risk behaviors.
Meta-analyses have demonstrated that total sedentary time is associated with CVD and 
mortality, independent of MVPA.(5, 37) However, these findings are largely based on self-
reported sedentary time, data which may underestimate the magnitude of the relationship 
between sedentariness and health risk.(38) Use of accelerometers reduces potential biases 
and measurement error inherent in self-report data. Nonetheless, only one study has reported 
on the association of objectively-measured sedentary time and mortality. This previous 
study, which comprised adults enrolled in NHANES and has been reported in several 
separate analyses,(10–14) has yielded conflicting results with some studies reporting a 
significant association between objectively-measured sedentary time and all-cause mortality,
(10, 11, 14, 15) but not others.(12, 13) Differences in inclusion/exclusion criteria, covariates, 
and follow-up time have been attributed to differences across analyses.(12) A relatively 
small sample size (n=1,096-4,840) and low minority representation (~9-14% black) have 
also limited previous findings from NHANES. Thus, our findings add to the literature by 
confirming the association of total sedentary time and mortality risk in a national, biracial 
cohort of ~8,000 middle- and older-aged adults, the largest study to date with objective 
measures of sedentary behavior and prospective health outcomes. The magnitude of the 
association of total sedentary time with all-cause mortality (2.6-fold greater risk for quartile 
4 vs. quartile 1) is notably higher than reported in meta-analyses (HR=1.22 [95% CI: 
1.09-1.41])(5), which could be attributed to use of objective measures and/or the analytic 
sample (e.g. middle- and older-aged adults, more blacks), and further underscores the total 
volume of sedentary behavior as a potent risk factor.
A key finding of this study is that it is the first to report that patterns of sedentary time 
accumulation are associated with mortality. Previous cross-sectional studies have reported 
associations between the total number of breaks in sedentary time/day (the reciprocal to 
mean sedentary bout length) and cardiometabolic biomarkers.(28, 39) These findings led to 
the “prolonger” vs. “breaker” hypothesis which postulates that it is not only the amount of 
sedentary time that is important to cardiometabolic health, but also the manner in which it is 
accumulated.(40) Subsequent experimental studies have corroborated this hypothesis as 
greater detrimental cardiometabolic effects have been observed following acute periods of 
prolonged, uninterrupted sedentary time relative to sedentary time that is periodically 
interrupted.(16, 17) Our findings extend those of previous studies by providing prospective 
evidence that prolonged, uninterrupted sedentary behavior is associated with a greater risk 
for all-cause mortality.
Current physical activity guidelines recommend all age groups minimize their amount of 
sedentary time.(41) These guidelines, however, are generalized and stop short of specific 
recommendations about how one should reduce sedentariness. Our finding of a joint

 association between the volume and pattern of sedentary behavior suggests that future 
guidelines should consider reductions in total sedentary time as well as prolonged sedentary 
bouts. Future randomized controlled trials, however, are still needed. Importantly, our 
findings also provide some of the first empirical evidence regarding how often sedentary 
behavior should be interrupted. We observed that accumulation of sedentary time in 60-89 
min and ≥90 min bouts were associated with a greater risk for all-cause mortality, while 
conversely, accumulation of sedentary time in 1-29 min bouts was associated with less of an 
increased mortality risk. With respect to the latter finding, it should be noted that 
accumulation of large volumes of sedentary time is a hazardous health behavior irrespective 
of how it’s accumulated. Nonetheless, this finding would suggest that accruing sedentary 
time in shorter bouts is the least harmful pattern of accumulation.
Currently, it is unclear how often sedentary time should be interrupted to reduce the risk 
incurred by prolonged sedentary bouts. Sedentary breaks every 30 min have been proposed 
as a feasible recommendation, (1, 42) which is supported by experimental studies showing 
sedentary breaks every 30 min elicit beneficial cardiometabolic effects.(17) Our results 
suggest guidelines aimed at every 30 min could be an optimal target to interrupt sedentary 
behavior as it was observed that accumulation of sedentary time in bouts of 1-29 min was 
associated with less of an increased mortality risk even after accounting for sedentary time 
accrued in bouts of 60-89 and ≥90 min. From a feasibility/adoption perspective, sedentary 
breaks every 60 or 90 min may be more tenable to public health uptake. However, middle- 
and older-aged adults average only ~ 2 sedentary bouts/day longer than 60 min and <1 
sedentary bout/day longer than 90 min.(43) Furthermore, in the present study the 
accumulation of sedentary time in bouts of 60-89 min and ≥90 min were no longer 
associated with mortality after accounting for the amount of sedentary time accrued from 
bouts of 1-29 min. However, caution is warranted when interpreting these results in light of 
the wide confidence intervals surrounding the point estimates for these bout thresholds.
Several limitations should be noted when interpreting our findings. First, the Actical™ 
cannot distinguish between different postures (e.g. sitting, standing), thus we relied on an 
intensity-only definition of sedentary behavior.(44) Second, only 7 days of accelerometer 
data were collected. Thus, the current study may have undersampled the exposure and 
yielded unreliable estimates of habitual sedentary time. Third, some participant risk factors 
were collected at baseline, several years (~6 years) prior to wearing the accelerometer, and 
may have changed (e.g., diabetes status). Thus, there may be residual confounding from 
misclassification of participants with respect to important confounders. However, in 
sensitivity analysis, for an unmeasured confounder to explain the association of total 
sedentary time or mean sedentary bout duration with all-cause mortality it would have to 
both increase the likelihood of being in the uppermost quartile for either sedentary 
characteristic and increase the risk of all-cause mortality by 2.0-3.0 fold above and beyond 
the measured covariates. This would constitute a substantial confounding. Fourth, there were 
a number of differences among REGARDS participants included vs. excluded from the 
current analyses. Excluded participants were more likely to be black, smoke, and have lower 
education levels, diabetes, hypertension, eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and history of CHD 
and had a greater risk for all-cause mortality compared to included participants (Appendix 
Table 5). Thus, our findings may not be generalizable to the entire REGARDS cohort.

 Furthermore, there is potential for selection bias as those who participated in REGARDS 
may not be representative of the general population. Fifth, in analyses examining the joint 
effects of total sedentary time and prolonged, uninterrupted sedentary bouts, the sample size 
and number of deaths were small for the groups that were high for only one of the sedentary 
characteristics (e.g., high total sedentary time/low sedentary bout time and low total 
sedentary time, high sedentary bout time). Although the association of total sedentary time 
alone, but not sedentary bout duration alone, with mortality is suggestive that the volume of 
sedentary time may be the more hazardous sedentary characteristic, the small number of 
events and wide confidence intervals in these groups render these findings inconclusive. 
Caution is thus warranted when interpreting these results. Finally, the relatively short follow-
up period may have led to reverse causation.
In conclusion, in a geographically diverse, biracial population-based sample of middle- and 
older aged U.S. adults, both total sedentary time and prolonged, uninterrupted sedentary 
bouts were associated with an increased risk for all-cause mortality, independent of physical 
activity levels. Our findings suggest that total sedentary time and prolonged, uninterrupted 
sedentary bouts are jointly associated with increased mortality risk and that breaking up 
sedentary time every 30 min may be protective against the health risks incurred by 
prolonged sedentariness. These data may be useful to inform specific recommendations for 
reducing sedentary behavior and support the concept that reducing and regularly breaking up 
sedentary time may be an important adjunct to existing physical activity guidelines.

 Figure 2. Hazard ratio of all-cause mortality as a function of total sedentary time (Panel A) and 
mean sedentary bout duration (Panel B) expressed continuously
Data were fitted using restricted cubic splines with the mean set as the reference and 4 knots 
placed at the 5th, 35th, 65th, and 95th percentiles. Results are trimmed at the 1st and 99th 
percentiles and are reported as hazard ratios (black line) and 95% confidence intervals (gray 
shaded area). Total sedentary time is a linear model (p-value for overall effect <0.001, p-
value for non-linear relationship=0.70) and mean sedentary bout duration is a non-linear 
model (p-value for overall effect <0.001, p-value for non-linear relationship <0.001). Models 
were adjusted for age, sex, race, region of residence, education, season, current smoking,

‖Minutes in which the accelerometer registered <50 counts per minute. Corrected for wear time and expressed as the estimated minutes/day of sedentary time given a standardized 16 hours of accelerometer 
wear (see Methods).
¶sedentary bout is defined as consecutive minutes in which the accelerometer registered <50 counts per min.
**Minutes in which the accelerometer registered 50–1064 counts per minute.
††Minutes in which the accelerometer registered ≥1065 counts per minute.
The quartile cutoff points were <7.7, ≥7.7 to <9.6, ≥ 9.6 to <12.4, and ≥12.4 min/bout.
