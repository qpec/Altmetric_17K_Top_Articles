 Study design: Cross-sectional 
1 
Background: Generalised joint hypermobility (GJH) may increase pain and likelihood of injuries and 
2 
also decrease function and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in elite level adolescent athletes.  
3 
Objectives: To assess the prevalence of GJH in elite level adolescent athletes, and to study the 
4 
association of GJH with pain, function, HRQoL, and musculoskeletal injuries. 
5 
Methods: A total of 132 elite level adolescent athletes (36 males; 96 females), mean (SD) age 14.0 
6 
(0.9) years, participated (n=22 ballet dancers, n=57 teamgym gymnasts, n=53 team handball players). 
7 
GJH was classified using the Beighton scores (BS) (GJH4: BS ≥ 4/9, GJH5: BS ≥ 5/9, GJH6: BS ≥ 
8 
6/9). Function of lower extremity, musculoskeletal injuries, and HRQoL were assessed with self-
9 
reported questionnaires, and part of physical performance was assessed by 4 postural sway tests and 2 
10 
one-legged hop for distance tests.  
11 
Results: Overall prevalence for GJH4, GJH5 and GJH6 was 27.3%, 15.9%, and 6.8%, respectively, 
12 
with a higher prevalence in ballet dancers and team gymnasts than in team handball players (GJH4: 
13 
68.2%, 24.6%, and 13.2 %). There was no significant difference in lower extremity function, injury 
14 
prevalence and related factors (exacerbation, recurrence, and absence from training) HRQoL, or 
15 
lengths of hop tests for those with and without GJH. However, the GJH group had significantly larger 
16 
centre of pressure path length across sway tests.  
17 
Conclusion: For ballet dancers and teamgym gymnasts the prevalence of GJH4 was higher than for 
18 
team handball players. For ballet dancers, the prevalence of GJH5 and GJH6 was higher than for team 
19 
handball players and the general adolescent population. The GJH group demonstrated larger sway in 
20 
the balance tests, which, in the current cross-sectional study did not have an association with injuries or 
21 
HRQoL. However, the risk of having (ankle) injuries due to larger sway for the GJH group must be 
22 
studied in future longitudinal studies.

 Background 
28 
Generalized joint hypermobility (GJH) has been suggested to play a role on the incidence of 
29 
musculoskeletal injuries in many sports activities. 32 Individuals with GJH have excessive range of 
30 
motion of joints. 17 GJH is typically classified using the Beighton’s 9-point scoring system, 34 with a 
31 
score of 4 or greater as the criterion for classification of GJH in adults. 35 The most frequent 
32 
symptomatic type of GJH is called Hypermobility Syndrome (HMS), and for adults, HMS is diagnosed 
33 
with the Brighton criteria, which is based on a score of 4 or more on the Beighton scale and the 
34 
presence of joint pain in more than 4 joints for a period longer than 3 months. 15 For children, there is 
35 
no consensus on a specific cut-point for GJH and the criteria for HMS have not yet been defined, and 
36 
therefore, cut-points of 5/9, 6/9, and 7/9 on the Beighton scale have been suggested.  18 
37 
Previous studies have found the prevalence of GJH to range from 2 to 57% depending on age, sex, 
38 
ethnicity, and the tests and criteria applied. 35 Within the general population of school children aged 14 
39 
a GJH (cut-point 4/9) prevalence of 11 to 28% has been reported. 4 Some studies have reported a high 
40 
prevalence of GJH for certain disciplines such as dancing and ballet, 7 29 possibly due to the great 
41 
requirements of flexibility in these activities. 29 However, no study has reported the prevalence of GJH 
42 
in elite level adolescent athletes for sport such as team handball, teamgym gymnastics, as well as ballet. 
43 
The consequences of GJH are suggested to include joint pain and musculoskeletal injuries, which can 
44 
result in decreased Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) 13 and decreased physical activity, in both 
45 
children and adolescents. 11 Despite no increased musculoskeletal pain or decreased perceived physical 
46 
activity in the general school children population aged 8 and 10 years old, 21 GJH was associated with  
47 
pain development in adolescents aged 14. 41 This may be due to imbalance in growth of bone and soft 
48 
tissues, as well hormonal changes, resulting in musculoskeletal pain, as the GJH children enter puberty. 
49 
12 Furthermore, a recent study reported elite level adult dancers with GJH aged 17-27 years to have 
50 
more musculoskeletal complaints, more fatigue, and reduced physical fitness level compared to dancers 
51 
and non-dancers without GJH. 39  
52 
Adult elite level athletes perceive injuries more often than non-elite athletes, and GJH is suggested to 
53 
lead to an increased injury frequency. 32 Reasons for an increased in injury frequency in those with 
54 
GJH may be ligamentous laxity and reduced knee joint proprioception, as found previously in a study 
55 
of children aged 8-15 with HMS. 14 Proprioception is known as an important part of the somatosensory

 system in controlling balance, with poor balance potentially associated with poor proprioception. 27 
57 
Poor balance, measured as increased sway, has been identified in adults with GJH, 30 and a recent study 
58 
found increased sway to be a predictor of what kind of injuries in a general population of children 9-15 
59 
years old. 38 However, adult elite level dancers have shown superior balance ability than the general 
60 
population, possibly because the elite level training leads to a protective effect of falling even in the 
61 
presence of GJH. 5 Whether or not elite level adolescent athletes with GJH have reduced balance 
62 
compared to those without GJH is unknown.   
63 
Additional reasons for sustaining an injury may be decreased muscle strength and consequently 
64 
decreased muscular stability, as confirmed in some studies of 8-10 year old children with symptomatic 
65 
GJH, 10 and in the general adolescent athlete, 3 but not in studies of children with non-symptomatic 
66 
GJH.  23 However, motor performance has never been studied in elite level adolescent athletes with 
67 
GJH. 
68 
Therefore, the current study aimed to determine the prevalence of GJH in elite level adolescent ballet 
69 
dancers, teamgym gymnasts, and team handball players.  A second aim was to investigate whether GJH 
70 
is associated with self-reported pain, functional ability, HRQoL, injury frequency, postural sway and 
71 
motor performance. 
72 
 
73 
METHODS 
74 
Design 
75 
This is a cross-sectional study of elite level adolescent athletes with and without GJH, which included 
76 
ballet dancers, teamgym gymnasts, and team handball players. 
77 
 
78 
Procedures 
79 
On the day of examination, all adolescents were tested for the presence of GJH by the same 
80 
physiotherapist (HS), before completing the motor performance tests. The participants completed 2 
81 
electronic questionnaires (HRQoL and injury occurrence), and performed 4 sway tests and 2 motor 
82 
performance tests. Three physiotherapists, 3 MSc students, and 1 teamgym coach administered the 2 
83 
motor performance tests. One associate professor, 1 PhD student, 5 MSc students, 2 physiotherapists, 
84 
and 1 teamgym coach administered the 2 questionnaires. All examiners and testers were instructed and

 trained thoroughly in the standardized test procedures prior to the investigation, and examiners, testers 
86 
and adolescents were blinded to their mutual test results and GJH status. Groups of 4 to 8 adolescents 
87 
were tested together, with test duration of 45 to 90 minutes per group. The participants moved through 
88 
the various testing locations in a semi random order to maximize time efficiency for testing. The study 
89 
took place from December 2013 to March 2014, at the participant’s usual training facilities.  
90 
 
91 
Study population 
92 
Participants were elite level adolescent athletes aged 13-16 years, who participated in ballet teamgym 
93 
gymnastics (non-contact sports), or team handball (contact sport). A total of 132 (36 boys, 96 girls) 
94 
adolescents participated, representing a random selection of 22 of 28 ballet dancers (79%), 57 of 184 
95 
teamgym gymnasts (31%), and 53 of 91 team handball players (58%). The teams were chosen by the 
96 
researcher and offered participation; both the whole team and the individual athlete within a team could 
97 
decline to participate. It was, however, not possible to perform analysis of the non participants. It was 
98 
primarily whole teams who participated with only few cases of individual non-participants. Reasons for 
99 
not participating were illness, denial to use the time/not wanting to be absent from training, 
100 
participation in other studies or parents` denial without reasons. The included ballet dancers 
101 
represented the absolute elite of ballet dancers in Denmark, while teamgym gymnasts and team 
102 
handball players represented elite level teams from 2/3 of the country at a minimum level of second 
103 
division, ranging up to Liga (highest division). When performing sport at this level, a high level of 
104 
training exposure per week (6.5-10.5 hours) was expected and confirmed in all 3 groups.  
105 
Parents of the participating adolescent gave their written informed consent, and before testing each 
106 
adolescent gave oral consent to participate, following the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical 
107 
2013).  The scientific ethics committee of the region of Southern Denmark concluded that this project 
108 
was not under the obligation of notification to the scientific ethics committee. Journal number S-

Clinical examination  
112 
The participants were tested to determine their Beighton score and the criteria applied to determine 
113 
their status on the Brighton test. 25 A goniometer was used to measure elbow and knee hyperextension

 above 10 degrees, for a potential score of up to 4 points (1 for each joint). Visual observation was used 
115 
to evaluate thumb to the volar aspect of the forearm, 5th finger dorsiflexion of above 90° and forward 
116 
bending including touching the palm of the hands on the floor. Participants were classified based on 3 
117 
cut points: GJH4 for a Beighton scale of 4 or higher; GJH5 for a Beighton scale of 5 or higher, and 
118 
GJH6 for a Beighton scale of 6 or higher. Demographics (sex, age, body mass, and height) were 
119 
obtained. Finally, the dominant leg was identified based on the question: ‘Which leg do you usually 
120 
kick a ball with?’.  
121 
 
122 
Questionnaires 
123 
The Rheumatoid and Arthritis Outcome Score for children (RAOS-Child) version LK1.0 was used for 
124 
measuring perceived leg function and HRQoL. 33 RAOS-Child was developed for children and is 
125 
presented in the same format as the Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for children (KOOS-Child). 
126 
This KOOS-Child has been validated in children, but only covers questions regarding the knee. 31 The 
127 
RAOS-Child modified from the KOOS-Child, covers questions regarding the hip, knee, and ankle. 
128 
Similar modifications have been performed to the KOOS questionnaire for adults, 36 to create the 
129 
RAOS, a valid, reliable, and responsive outcome measurement. 1 These properties have not been tested 
130 
for the RAOS-Child, but it is assumed that the questionnaire has similar properties as the adult version. 
131 
As in the RAOS, the RAOS-Child consists of 5 domains: pain, symptoms, ADL, sport/recreation, and 
132 
HRQoL (www.koos.nu), with questions on complaints during the most recent week, and answers are 
133 
scored from 0-4. In total, 48 questions are answered, with the total scores for each dimension ranging 
134 
from 0-100 (0=extreme symptoms; 100=no symptoms).   
135 
In addition to RAOS-Child, the participants completed an injury questionnaire, with a one-month 
136 
recall. The questions included number and location of acute and overuse injuries (in numbers), 
137 
recurrence of an acute or overuse injury, exacerbation of an acute or overuse injury (yes/no), and the 
138 
amount of absence from training and competition due to injuries, rated as “not absent”, “partly absent”, 
139 
and “totally absent”. The questionnaire was developed and modified from existing studies on injuries 
140 
among ballet, teamgym, and team handball participants. 2 28 32 The questionnaire was pretested on a 
141 
similar group of adolescents, with respect to understanding the definitions of injuries. After pre-test a 
142 
few words were adjusted. The following definitions were used: Acute pain/injury: “A pain/injury 
143 
occurring suddenly in the context of a known action/exercise”. Overuse injury: “A pain in the muscles,

 tendons, or joints that develops over a period without any known reason”. Recurrence of injury/pain: 
145 
“Pain/damage of the same type and location as experienced previously”. Exacerbation of injury/pain: 
146 
“A known injury/pain that is being exacerbated by known or unknown cause”.  
147 
 
148 
Static motor performance 
149 
Four different postural sway tests were performed, including: 2-legged stance with eyes open (2EO) 
150 
and eyes closed (2EC), 1-legged stance on non-dominant leg with eyes open (1EO) and eyes closed 
151 
(1EC).  
152 
Postural sway was tested using a portable Nintendo Wii Board (area 45.5 cm x 26.5 cm), with a 
153 
sampling frequency of 20 Hz. This device has been shown to have satisfactory reliability and validity 
154 
in children and adolescents. 26 The Nintendo Wii Board measures centre of pressure (COP), a measure 
155 
of ground reaction force vector produced by movements of body segments. Postural sway is 
156 
determined by the excursion of the COP over a fixed period of time. 6 The Nintendo Wii Board was 
157 
connected to a laptop computer, with a custom-build program, called Sway With Wii calculating 95% 
158 
Confidence Ellipse Area (CEA), Anterior and Posterior (AP), and Medio and Lateral (ML) 
159 
displacement of COP. The COP path Length (COPL) was further calculated as the total distance 
160 
travelled by the COP over 1 trial (30 sec).  
161 
All trials were performed during 30 seconds with bare feet, the participants looking at a fixed eye-level 
162 
target, placed approximately 2.5 meter away, and with arms crossed at the chest, consistent with 
163 
previous studies. 22 In the 2EO and 2EC conditions the participants stood with heels and toes together, 
164 
and in the 1EO and 1EC conditions the contralateral leg’s big toe was placed on the medial malleolus 
165 
of the test leg. One trial of the 2EO condition was done to familiarize the participant with the testing, 
166 
while the remaining 3 balance conditions were measured for 3 successful trials, allowing for a 
167 
maximum of 3 failures (e.g., excessive movements of the arms or legs from the original posture, 
168 
touchdown by the foot on the floor or the measurement equipment, opening of the eyes during 2EC or 
169 
1EC tests, or placing more than the big toe on the test leg). If the participant failed to complete the test 
170 
more than 3 times, the test was cancelled and the examiner proceeded to the next test. Between each 
171 
trial, the participant rested for approximately 30 seconds.

173 
Dynamic motor performance 
174 
For assessing dynamic motor performance 2 hop tests were performed: one leg single hop for distance 
175 
(OLHD) and one leg triple crossover hop for distance (COH).  Each test was performed 3 times in the 
176 
above order. Both tests have shown satisfactory reliability. 37 
177 
For OLHD, the participant stood barefooted on the test leg, with his/her toe behind the start line. The 
178 
participants were instructed to hop forward as far as possible, allowing to use their arms, land on the 
179 
same leg, and keep their balance for at least 2 seconds after landing. The length of the OLHD was 
180 
measured in cm from the big toe before take-off to the heel after landing.  
181 
For COH, the participant stood barefooted on the test leg along a 7 m line on the floor, with the toe 
182 
behind the start line. When hopping on the right leg, the initial start location was on the right side of the 
183 
line, and vice versa for the left leg. The participant was instructed to perform 3 consecutive one-legged 
184 
maximal hops forward, each time crossing the line on the floor, allowing to use the arms and keeping 
185 
their balance for at least 2 seconds after landing the third hop. When completing the third consecutive 
186 
hop the total length of the COH was measured from the big toe before take-off to the heel after landing. 
187 
If the participant did not keep their balance at landing, or if there was a delay between hops, the trial 
188 
was disregarded. The participant was allowed to practice the test up to twice with each leg, and both 
189 
mean and maximum distances were calculated.  
190 
 
191 
Data analysis 
192 
Descriptive statistics were summarized using frequency tables and means. For demographic data, group 
193 
differences by level of GJH status were tested using univariate Generalized Linear Model (GLM) 
194 
regression (continuous) and logistic regression (nominal) with sport type as fixed factor.  
195 
The final GLM, mixed model, included perceived (questionnaires) and measured variables (static sway 
196 
and hop lengths, one at a time) as dependent factor, while GJH status (GJH4, GJH5, GJH6, one at a 
197 
time), type of sport, and sex were fixed factors, and age and body mass index (BMI) were covariates. 
198 
ID number was inserted as random factor and trial number as repeated factor in the final GLM model. 
199 
Only 1 trial was performed for the 2EO condition, max OLHD and max COH, therefore a GLM 
200 
without repeated factors was used for analyses of these variables, and the variables from the

 questionnaires. For injury frequency and location logistic regression analyses (backward Likelihood 
202 
Ratio) were used, with sex and Sport as categorical, while age and BMI were covariates. 
203 
Based on the power calculations, at least 26 adolescents with and 79 without GJH were required to 
204 
show a difference of 29% in injury prevalence between groups, 2 with a power of 80% and a 
205 
significance level of 0.05. All analyses were performed in SPSS version 22 (IBM SPSS Inc, Chicago, 
206 
IL, USA, released on 2013), and P-values less than .05 (2-tailed) were considered statistically 
207 
significant.  
208 
 
209 
RESULTS  
210 
Prevalence of GJH in elite level adolescent athletes was 27.3%, 15.9%, and 6.8%, based on GJH4, 
211 
GJH5, and GJH6, respectively (TABLE 1). The participants with and without GJH were comparable 
212 
on all demographic variables, except for an increased prevalence of girls in all GJH groups (TABLE 
213 
1). There was a significant difference between sports, with a higher prevalence of GJH4 in ballet 
214 
(68.2%) and teamgym (24.6%), compared to team handball (13.2%). The prevalence of GJH5 and 
215 
GJH6 was significantly higher for ballet than team handball (GJH5, P= .004; GJH6, P=.024), while sex 
216 
distribution was similar. 
217 
There was no significant difference in lower extremity HRQoL between those with and without GJH 
218 
(TABLE 2), but significant effects of sports type were identified for RAOS symptoms and HRQoL, with 
219 
ballet and teamgym having lower scores than team handball. No significant difference between those with 
220 
and without GJH was found in perceived injuries and related factors (exacerbation, recurrence, or absence 
221 
from training between groups), regardless of the cut-point (TABLE 3). 
222 
In all balance tests, GJH had significantly larger COPL than those without GJH (TABLE 4).  For the 
223 
1CE test fewer participants with GJH completed at least 1 of the trials (GJH4, 72% versus 83%, 
224 
P=.006; GJH5, 57% versus 84%, P<.001). Significant effects were seen for sex and sport for 1EO 
225 
(teamgym gymnasts and boys having largest sway) and 1EC (team handball players and boys having 
226 
largest sway) conditions. 
227 
Overall, there was no significant difference between those with and without GJH for the 2 hop tests 
228 
OLHD and COH (TABLE 4).

 Discussion 
230 
For ballet dancers and teamgym gymnasts the current prevalence of GJH4 was higher than for team 
231 
handball players, and furthermore, for ballet dancers the prevalence of GJH5 and GJH6 was higher 
232 
than for team handball players and the general adolescent population. The Injury frequency, HRQoL 
233 
and functional muscle performance was not different between those with and without GJH, but those 
234 
with GJH demonstrated larger sway in the balance tests.  
235 
As previously described, specific elite sports like ballet have higher prevalence of GJH, however, with 
236 
a clear decline in prevalence from student to the professional level. 29  
237 
The present high prevalence of GJH4 in ballet (68.2%) and teamgym (24.6%) is consistent with 
238 
previous studies of elite level adolescent ballet dancers 29 and gymnasts, but higher than the prevalence 
239 
in the general adolescent athletes. 8 An explanation for the high prevalence in ballet may partly be due 
240 
to inclusion of the forward flexion in the Beighton scale, which is known to correlate highly with being 
241 
a ballet dancer. 35 Although warming-up and training sessions differed between and within sports 
242 
groups at the time of testing this is not likely to have biased the data in relation to prevalence of GJH. 
243 
Other factors like sex could not explain the different prevalence, 35 because sex distribution of 
244 
participants was equal across the 3 sports. The large prevalence of GJH in ballet dancers indicates that 
245 
ballet is a sport where those with GJH often choose to participate and that GJH may help in becoming a 
246 
successful ballet dancer. Teamgym routines also require flexibility, and the prevalence of GJH4 is 
247 
remarkably higher than in the general population, but not as high as in ballet by this age group. An 
248 
explanation for that may be that GJH is only helpful in the younger gymnasts where the trampoline and 
249 
tumbling is not so demanding. But with increasing age along with increased requirements of strength 
250 
and power, in addition to muscular stability, the condition of GJH does not seem to be an advantage 
251 
any more. 
252 
No difference between groups with and without GJH was found with respect to perceived leg function, 
253 
including pain and HRQoL, which is in contrast with a recent study showing GJH in the general school 
254 
children population aged 8 or 10 years to be a possible contributing and predictive factor for pain 
255 
development when reaching 13-15 years. 41 In our participants the high training volume may be 
256 
protective against pain and injuries, consistent with a previous study indicating that schoolchildren with 
257 
GJH and high physical fitness generally had fewer musculoskeletal complaints.  16 Conversely,

 vigorous exercise may lead to short-term lower limb pain in schoolchildren. 9 The current findings 
259 
could also reflect an altered perception of pain and HRQoL in elite level adolescent athletes, because 
260 
athletes generally seem to have higher HRQoL than non-athletes. 33 It is noted that in the present study 
261 
ballet and teamgym participants had lower HRQoL than team handball players, as also previously 
262 
reported. 2 29 39 
263 
The current study did not find increased self-reported injury frequency in elite level adolescent athletes 
264 
with GJH, which is consistent with the results of a recent study on children. 19 However, this is in 
265 
contrast to the results of a previous systematic review where GJH was associated with an increased risk 
266 
of knee injuries in athletes with a wide age span from 9 to 39 years undertaking different sports, 
267 
especially contact sports. 32 Our results also contrast with those of a 5-year follow-up study where more 
268 
adult dancers with GJH had multiple joint pain, and had to take time off from dancing greater than 6 
269 
weeks due to an injury. 2 The authors of this study hypothesised that injuries in individuals with GJH 
270 
may take more time to heal, and that there may be greater tissue damage before an injury is reported. 2 
271 
Overall, it appears that participation in sports at a high level leads to an increased risk of injuries for 
272 
adults, which may not be the case for the general children population, and those who participated in our 
273 
study.  
274 
In this study, COPL was significantly larger in those with GJH for all balance tests, consistent with 
275 
recent findings in schoolchildren of the same age with GJH. 24 The increased sway, especially with the 
276 
eyes closed conditions, may reflect altered proprioception in those with GJH, consistent with results 
277 
from symptomatic individuals with GJH. 14 Contrary to a previous report that increased postural sway 
278 
is strongly associated with increased risk of lower limb injuries, 38  participants in the current study did 
279 
not report higher incidence of pain or injury.  
280 
The participants with and without GJH performed similarly on the 2 hop tests, this is in contrast with 
281 
the results of previous studies of a mixed group of adolescents with GJH who had decreased jumping 
282 
and walking capacity. 39 40 Despite similar performance, it is possible that muscle activation strategies 
283 
differed between groups, 20 a line of investigation deserving additional attention. 
284 
The participation rate was different among sports, with a 79% participation rate for ballet, 31% for 
285 
teamgym, and 58% for team handball. A sensitivity analysis showed no difference in the factors such 
286 
as age, sex, and BMI between those who participated and those who did not.  Different sports may 
287 
reflect different training cultures.

 A potential limitation may be the use of the current self-reported injury questionnaire, which has not 
289 
yet been tested for psychometric properties. To minimize the risk of information/interpretation bias, the 
290 
testers read the injury questionnaire to the participant and were therefore available to assist in 
291 
interpretation, if necessary. The short-term recall period of 1 month was used to optimize recall of 
292 
injuries. 1 Data collection occurred outside the period of shows/competition, which may not be fully 
293 
representative of the more intense period of activities for elite level adolescent athletes. The required 
294 
sample size of 26 participants with GJH was reached when using GJH4 as the criterion but not for 
295 
GJH5 and GJH6, potentially limiting the ability to identify difference between groups when using these 
296 
latter 2 criteria. Strengths of the study include standardized testing procedures, blinding of testers and 
297 
participants, training of the testers, and the use of reliable and valid objective tests. 41 Validity of the 
298 
classification for GJH was optimized by using a single examiner.  25 The interpretation of the data is 
299 
limited to elite level adolescent athletes participating in sports such as ballet, teamgym, and team 
300 
handball.   
301 
 
302 
CONCLUSION 
303 
For ballet dancers and teamgym gymnasts the prevalence of GJH4 was higher than for team handball 
304 
players, and furthermore, for ballet dancers the prevalence of GJH5 and GJH6 was higher than for team 
305 
handball players and the general adolescent population. The Injury frequency, HRQoL and functional 
306 
muscle performance was not different between those with and without GJH. Those with GJH 
307 
demonstrated larger sway in the balance tests, which, in the current cross-sectional study was not 
308 
associated with injury prevalence and HRQoL. However, the possible risk of injuries due to larger 
309 
sway in this group must be studied in future longitudinal studies 
310 
 
311 
 
312 
KEY POINTS: 
313 
Findings: Elite level adolescent athletes with and without GJH participating in ballet, teamgym, and 
314 
team handball had no significant difference in incidence of injury, pain, self-rated function, HRQoL, 
315 
and hop tests.

 Implications: The current sports participants with GJH do not have higher prevalence of adverse 
318 
health outcomes in this cross-sectional study.    
319 
Caution: The study was limited to a 1-month recall period for injury and included individuals 
320 
participating in only 3 sports and who were of a homogeneous age group, limiting the external validity 
321 
of the results. Furthermore, the current injury questionnaire, have not yet been tested for psychometric 
322 
properties.
