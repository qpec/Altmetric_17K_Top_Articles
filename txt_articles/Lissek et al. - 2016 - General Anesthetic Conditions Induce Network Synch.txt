General anesthetics are commonly used in animal models to study how sensory signals
are represented in the brain. Here, we used two-photon (2P) calcium activity imaging
with cellular resolution to investigate how neuronal activity in layer 2/3 of the mouse barrel
cortex is modified under the influence of different concentrations of chemically distinct
general anesthetics. Our results show that a high isoflurane dose induces synchrony
in local neuronal networks and these cortical activity patterns closely resemble those
observed in EEG recordings under deep anesthesia. Moreover, ketamine and urethane
also induced similar activity patterns. While investigating the effects of deep isoflurane
anesthesia on whisker and auditory evoked responses in the barrel cortex, we found that
dedicated spatial regions for sensory signal processing become disrupted. We propose
that our isoflurane-2P imaging paradigm can serve as an attractive model system to
dissect cellular and molecular mechanisms that induce the anesthetic state, and it might
also provide important insight into sleep-like brain states and consciousness.

INTRODUCTION
Changes in brain activity, with up and down states (Constantinople and Bruno, 2011), and
synchrony/desynchrony (Klimesch, 1996) dynamics, tend to correlate with various behavioral
states (Poulet and Petersen, 2008), such as wakefulness, sleep, and locomotion. It is known that
general anesthesia alters neuronal and neuroglial activity parameters (Heinke and Koelsch, 2005;
Windels and Kiyatkin, 2006; Thrane et al., 2012) and brain states (Cimenser et al., 2011). In
particular, there is a very close similarity of brain activity under anesthesia to sleep-like brain states
(Tung and Mendelson, 2004; Van Dort et al., 2008; Bonhomme et al., 2011). It has been suggested
that general anesthesia induced changes in neural activity might provide fundamental insight into
the cellular and network mechanisms (Ishizawa, 2007) that shift brain states along the unconscious-
conscious continuum (Alkire et al., 2008; Forman and Chin, 2008; Shin et al., 2013; Mashour, 2014;
Barttfeld et al., 2015; Meyer, 2015).
 Lissek et al.
Anesthesia Changes Neuronal Network Parameters
Anesthetic agents act on different molecular targets (Solt and
Forman, 2007; Nau, 2008; Sanders et al., 2008; Urban, 2008; Zeller
et al., 2008), which in turn alter neuronal network activity. It
is thought that isoflurane operates by increasing activity of γ-
aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAAR) and potassium
channels (Franks and Lieb, 1988; Rudolph and Antkowiak, 2004;
Hemmings et al., 2005; Eikermann et al., 2011). Ketamine appears
to inhibit N-methyl- D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor activity
(Rudolph and Antkowiak, 2004; Hemmings et al., 2005) and
addition of xylazine, a α2-adrenoreceptor agonist, to ketamine
enhances its sedative effects (Green et al., 1981; Lu et al., 2008)
and exerts anticonvulsive properties (Green et al., 1981). Finally,
urethane (ethyl carbamate) appears to act on both inhibitory and
excitatory molecular targets (Hara and Harris, 2002).
Electroencephalographical (EEG) studies suggest that burst
suppression (BS), which is characterized by a quasiperiodical
pattern of high voltage activity (bursts) and flat line (suppression)
periods (Liley and Walsh, 2013), appears to be quite similar
in subjects under deep general anesthesia (Brown et al., 2010)
and human patients suffering from hypoxic–ischemic trauma
and coma (Young, 2000). It was further suggested that brain
wide synchronous states of recurrent activity play a key role,
possibly to generate unconsciousness. However, multielectrode
recordings of the human cortex at a mesoscopic scale suggest
that BS can be asynchronous with regard to different cortical
areas and there are both corticocortical and thalamocortical
circuits that possibly interact with each other to generate
unconsciousness (Lewis et al., 2013; Bojak et al., 2015). It is
conceivable that anesthetics acting as GABAergic modulators
are likely to exert their anesthetic effects differently on local
cortical circuits, possibly because different neurons are decorated
with a different collection of ion channels and receptors. It is
quite intriguing that isoflurane (Hartikainen et al., 1995; Akrawi
et al., 1996), sevoflurane (Jäntti et al., 1998), propofol (Akrawi
et al., 1996; Huotari et al., 2004), thiopental (Akrawi et al.,
1996), or etomidate (Akrawi et al., 1996) evoke bursts in various
model organisms during deep anesthesia after presentation
of a range of visual, auditory, tactile, and noxious stimuli.
Moreover, anesthesia appears to disrupt sensory boundaries
because in a previously reported study tone-evoked neural
responses were detected in the visual cortex (Land et al., 2012).
How neurons in microcircuits change their activity patterns
under the influence of different general anesthetics is still
not known.
To
investigate
the
effects
of
general
anesthesia
on
visually identifiable neurons in cortical microcircuits, we
performed in vivo two-photon calcium (Ca2+) imaging using a
genetically-encoded fluorescent Ca2+ indicator (GECI) YC2.60
(Nagai et al., 2004; Yamada et al., 2011). It is known that Ca2+
transients in neurons closely reflect neuronal spiking activity
and that the fluorescence changes of GECIs can therefore serve
as a proxy for neuronal activity (Hasan et al., 2004; Wallace et al.,
2008; Lütcke et al., 2010). Our experimental 2PI-GECI paradigm
can help to dissect the local and distributed cortical circuits and
other brain circuits that generate unconsciousness by anesthetic
treatments and it may also provide some insight into the cellular
and molecular mechanisms underlying consciousness.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animal Welfare
All experiments conformed to the animal welfare guidelines of
the Max Planck Society. Efforts were made to minimize numbers
of animals used and all experimental procedures were approved
by the local authorities (Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe).
Plasmid Construct and Virus Purification
The YC3.60 gene in the plasmid, pAAV-hSYN-YC3.60 (Shevtsova
et al., 2005; Lütcke et al., 2010), was removed and replaced with
the YC2.60 (Nagai et al., 2004) gene. We generated rAAV with
hybrid serotype 2/1 as described previously (Dogbevia et al.,
2015).
rAAV Injection and Chronic Window
Surgery
Surgical implantation of the cranial window was performed on 6–
7 weeks old C57BL/6N mice. The animals were anesthetized with
an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (65 mg/kg body weight)
and xylazine (14 mg/kg body weight). The surgical procedure
was started only after animals no longer responded to tail or
paw pinch. Throughout the surgery, animals were kept on a
heating pad to prevent hypothermia. Eye cream (Bepanthen,
Bayer) was applied to the eyes of mice to prevent dehydration.
The animals were stabilized on a stereotactic frame (Kopf
instruments). The skin above the skull was cut open with a
surgical knife and the somatosensory cortex region was carefully
marked. Subsequently, the skull was thinned with a dental drill
and the cranial bone was carefully removed with a forceps and
Ringer buffer was applied to moist the area. Bleeding that occurs
during surgical procedures was stopped by applying small pieces
of Tachosil. Using a micropipette, a small volume (200 nl) of virus
(AAV-hSYN-YC2.60) was injected into the somatosensory cortex
(AP −1,5; ML +3.0; DV −0.4, −0.3; all in mm from bregma)
at a depth of 500 µm from the pia as described previously
(Wallace et al., 2008; Lütcke et al., 2010). The open area of the
cranial bone was covered with a circular glass (4 mm diameter)
and sealed with dental cement. The dura mater was kept moist
with Ringer buffer during the whole procedure. A head-plate
was attached to the skull with superglue and additional dental
cement was used to close the gaps between head-plate and skull.
To avoid post-operative dehydration, mice were injected with
physiological saline solution. To reduce moderate acute pain,
buprenorphine (Buprenex, 0.1 µg/g body weight) was injected
after the surgical procedure. Mice were placed on a heating-pad
while recovering from surgery.
Chronic In vivo Two-Photon Calcium
Imaging
Calcium imaging was performed using a commercial two-photon
laser-scanning microscope (LSM 510 META, Zeiss), equipped
with a Ti:sapphire laser (Chameleon Ultra II, Coherent), a
40× water immersion objective (Achroplan 40×/0.8 W IR, Zeiss)
and multialkali photomultiplier tubes (R6357, Hamamatsu).
Cells labeled with YC2.60 were excited at 850 nm or 870 nm, and
emitted light from cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and yellow

fluorescent protein (YFP) was detected after passing through a
510 nm dichroic beam splitter and, subsequently, through a blue
bandpass filter (CFP, BP 435–485, Zeiss) and a green long-pass
filter (YFP, LP 515, Zeiss). Images were acquired at a frame
rate of ∼4 Hz, with a resolution of 128 × 128 pixels with the
software provided by the microscope manufacturer. To revisit
the same cells, we used blood vessel patterns and stereotactic
coordinates. Furthermore, custom-built titanium headplates and
the corresponding fixation devices ensured reproducible fixation
of the animals under the microscope.
Sensory Stimulation
Deflection of all whiskers on the animal’s right side was achieved
using a short train of air-puffs (single puff duration = 130 ms,
rate = 5 Hz, number of puffs per train = 5, pressure = 25
psi). The stimulation pattern was programmed into a Master-8
stimulus generator (A.M.P.I.) and air puffs were generated by
a Picospritzer (General Valve). For sound-only trials, the air-
pressure was reduced to 0 psi and the stimulator was directed
away from the animal. Each trial was 74 s long and contained 3
air-puff trains at 5, 30, and 55 s. To avoid short-term adaptive
changes in neuronal responses, the interval between trials varied
between 30 s and 2 min. Routine visual checks ensured for
efficient and reproducible whisker deflection from trial-to-trial.
Image recording and whisker stimulation were time-locked
by triggering the Master-8 through the microscope’s image
acquisition software.
Anesthetic Conditions for Long-Term
Functional Imaging
Mice
were
anesthetized
with
isoflurane,
ketamine
alone,
ketamine/xylazine or urethane. For detailed description of
criteria for anesthetic depth, see Supplementary Table 1. Body
temperature was monitored through a heat sensor beneath
the animal and kept at 37◦C with a heating blanket. Under
deep anesthesia, lotion (Bepanthen) was applied to the eyes to
prevent drying. In between trials, the animal’s behavior was
closely monitored and documented. For isoflurane experiments,
a gaseous mixture of air and the indicated percentage of
isoflurane was generated by a commercial vaporizer (Isotec 4,
Surgivet) and was applied through a mask with a custom-built
non-rebreathing circuit and a flow-rate of 3–4 l/min. Mice
were induced at 4% isoflurane for ∼30 s and then mounted
on the microscope stage. The isoflurane concentration was
then immediately reduced to 1% while the setup was prepared
for subsequent imaging. After a time period of ∼10 min, the
isoflurane concentration was further reduced to 0.5% which
was followed by a waiting interval of 15 min before image
acquisition began. For ketamine/xylazine experiments, an initial
dose of 65 mg/kg ketamine and 14 mg/kg xylazine was applied
by intraperitoneal injection before mounting the animal on the
stage. To maintain the anesthetic depth, 40% of the initial dose
was injected 30–45 min after induction. When only ketamine was
used, animals were injected with an initial dose of 130 mg/kg.
To induce and maintain deep anesthesia, subsequent doses of
50 mg/kg were given to animals. For urethane experiments,
animals were given a dose of 1.5 g/kg by intraperitoneal injection.
Two supplemental doses of 0.7 g/kg were given 1 and 2 h after
induction.
Using the imaging and anesthesia paradigms described above,
we performed repeated two-photon activity imaging on the
same mice under different anesthetic conditions. Sessions with
different anesthetics were carried out in the following order:
(1) ketamine/xylazine, (2) isoflurane, (3) ketamine only, (4)
isoflurane for sound only trials, and finally (5) urethane. After
each session with ketamine or ketamine/xylazine, animals were
given at least 5 days to recover. In the case of isoflurane, they
were given 2 days to recover. After completion of the urethane
experiments, animals were sacrificed for immunofluorescence
analysis.
Immunofluorescence and Confocal
Microscopy
Mice were anesthetized with either isoflurane or urethane,
transcardially perfused with 1× phosphate buffer saline (PBS)
followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS, and brains were
post-fixed for 12 h at 4◦C. Free-floating sections (70 µm) were
cut using a vibratome (Leica) and incubated for 1 h at room
temperature in blocking solution (2% gelatin from cold water fish
skin, 2% BSA and 0.1 % Triton-100 in PBS). Next, slices were
incubated overnight with primary antibodies diluted in blocking
solution at room temperature (RT). The following primary
antibodies were used: NeuN (Millipore, mouse, 1:800 or 1:1000),
GFAP (DAKO, rabbit; 1:600). Slices were either incubated with
both primary antibodies simultaneously or different, adjacent
slices were incubated with a single antibody (either NeuN or
GFAP). No difference was found between the single- and double-
staining. After washing with 1:3 diluted blocking solution, slices
were placed in a solution containing a fluorophore-conjugated
secondary antibody (goat-anti-mouse Cy3 and/or goat-anti-
rabbit Cy5, Jackson Immuno Research Lab, 1:700 or 1:800, in 1:3
dilution of initial blocking solution) for 1.5 h at RT. Finally, slices
were washed with PBS and mounted on glass slides using 80%
glycerol in PBS. Wide-field fluorescence images were acquired
with an Axioplan-2 microscope (Zeiss). Confocal microscope
images were acquired at a resolution of 1024 × 1024 pixels with
a Leica SP2, equipped with a 63× glycerol immersion objective.
For YC2.60 expression analysis, merged confocal images were
analyzed manually for the co-localization of NeuN or GFAP
with YC2.60. For a better print quality and red-to-black contrast
perception, example NeuN and GFAP images in Figure 1 were
enhanced slightly without altering any information content of the
image.
Extraction of Raw Traces
All data was analyzed using custom Matlab (Mathworks)
routines. Stack data was pre-processed to compensate for intra-
and inter-trial shifts in the field of view. For this, the raw
128 × 128 pixel images from one of the channels of the YC2.60
stack data were fed into an ECC image alignment algorithm
(Evangelidis and Psarakis, 2008) with the first image of each stack
serving as an alignment template. This way, whole frame-to-
frame x-y shifts could be successfully removed. Movements in
the z-axis were ignored since out-of-focus movements did not

lead to significant changes in �R/R. A 5% safety margin was
taken into account on either side of the field of view and ROIs
outside of this margin were removed from analysis. To ensure
alignment to the first stack of each series of trials and therefore
the defined ROI set, stacks were then aligned to their respective
reference stack. This way, ROI sets were fully overlapping in
between trials. Elliptical ROIs were defined manually and only
clearly visible cells were chosen for analysis (Supplementary
Figure 2). Once a ROI set was defined, it was maintained
throughout all trials with only minor corrections applied to
individual ROIs when necessary. Stacks whose inter-trial shifts
were not successfully corrected were manually removed for
further analysis.
Elliptical ROIs were further processed to confine analyzed
pixels to actual cell boundaries and remove uncorrelated
(neuropil) noise as described previously (Ozden et al., 2008).
For this, �R/R traces of each pixel over time in each ROI
were compared to each other using pairwise linear correlation
coefficients (Pearson’s r). For each ROI, pixels that exhibited
correlation above a threshold, which was drawn from the
population of all possible pairwise correlations in 10 overlapping
time windows for every pixel trace and constituted more or
equal to 10% of all pixels in the processed ROI, were selected
for analysis. This ensured that ROIs (cells) that showed calcium
events were optimally thresholded according to their activity
signature and pixels (regions) that were not involved in the

actual calcium event were neglected for further analyses. If the
algorithm selected <10% of pixels in a specific ROI, the respective
ROI was not changed and all manually selected pixels were taken
into account.
Mean R-values of each ROI were then extracted and further
processed to yield �R/R traces for each cell. Briefly, raw
R-values of each trace were fit with a generalized extreme
value (GEV) distribution, which yielded a first estimate of
R0. Given that calcium transients lead to positive deflection
in a cell’s activity trace, the baseline (R0) was then extracted
as the mean of all values in between minimum (R) and
GEVmean + (GEVmean − minimum(R)) to remove all large
transients that would distort the baseline R0 and are apparent as
outliers toward the right end of the distribution. This baseline
was then used to calculate �R/R for each respective ROI. Due
to this procedure, �R/R traces could be easily compared with
each other since this analysis is robust toward large calcium
transients that would otherwise shift R0 with them. To extract a
peak threshold from �R/R traces, butterworth high-pass filtering
at 0.1∗frame rate cut-off was applied to remove all putative peaks
and slow baseline drifts and traces were thresholded at >2.5 S.D.
of a normal distribution parameter estimate. Traces were filtered
using a digital smoothing polynomial filter (Savitzky–Golay) and
the same parameters were used throughout the analysis. Peak
times and amplitudes were extracted using the filtered traces
that were robust against noisy peaks that would distort peak
amplitudes and times. Peak amplitudes were further corrected
by subtracting the minimum in 10 frames preceding the peak
maximum to compensate for drifts (corrected amplitudes). Peaks
that had a distance of <10 frames to the last peak and had a
corrected amplitude of <1.5 S.D. of noise level were disregarded
as noise/complex peaks. Traces and peaks were visually inspected
after the analysis process was completed on a random subset of
the data to find an optimal set of parameters, which was then used
for all trials in all mice and days. If not otherwise denoted, peak
amplitudes and number of events are given as mean over all trials
per mouse/session.
Correlation Analysis
We applied Pearson’s pairwise correlation coefficient as a proxy
for synchrony in the imaged neuronal network. All analyzed
traces had a length of 300 frames (∼74 s) and peak time points
extracted from these traces were fed into Matlab’s built-in “corr”
function to extract Pearson’s r. The accuracy of this calculation
and the magnitude of correlation depend strongly on the correct
peak time extraction. Peak times could be spread over adjacent
frames in time because of the delayed registration due to the
slow scan time of the imaging setup (∼4 Hz) and therefore we
corrected peak times according to the cell’s relative y-position
(top to bottom) in the field of view. This means that peaks get
assigned a probability (p) value close to 1 if the cell’s y-position
comes close to the end of the scan path and close to 0 at the
beginning of the scan path. This way, absolute peak times that
are originally registered in only one frame are spread over two
adjacent frames with the preceding frame getting an assigned
peak probability of 1-p respectively (Ozden et al., 2008). Applying
this method allows for a partial compensation of timing artifacts
in peak registration.
To investigate the relation between distance and synchrony
within cell pairs, the analysis was performed on distinct bins
representing pairwise distance between cells from 0 to the
maximum distance in micrometer. For the analysis represented
in Figures 2E,F, the data was taken as is without any filtering
applied after calculation of pairwise correlations. Figure 2D
shows a cumulative frequency distribution of all pairwise
correlations that were analyzed, irrespective of mouse or trial,
but filtered for a significance level <5% with built-in Matlab
functions, since a high level of near-zero “noise” in pairwise
correlations could have affected the analysis and pulled the mean
correlations down. This analysis yielded highly similar results to
those represented in Figure 2F. This approach was also chosen to
process correlation measures taken for the datasets presented in
Figure 3B.
Stimulus Response Analysis
For the “-stim events” datasets presented in Figure 2E and the
datasets in Figure 3C, stimulus related events were defined as
calcium peaks following the stimulus (whisker air-puff/tone)
time points in each trial within a 2 s time window. The rational
behind this approach came from visual inspection of raw traces,
observed stimulus responses during the experiments and the
fact that some complex and large calcium transients that were
elicited by whisker stimuli had a long rise time that shifted
peak times significantly away from the stimulus initiation and
therefore justified this long registration time window. Peak times
and not rise times were taken as basis for analysis since the
initiation time of calcium traces could not be clearly identified
due to baseline noise. As for the analysis presented in Figure 4C
(RND datasets), the original dataset was analyzed in the same way
with 3 non-overlapping stimulus windows that were randomly
chosen for each analyzed trial. If the observed effects were purely
random and/or depending on increased frequency of detected
peaks per trial that would in turn increase the probability of
peaks falling inside the 2-s windows, the observed trends would
not be expected to vanish with random permutation of detection
windows.
Statistical Analysis
All statistics were calculated in GraphPad Prism. Non-parametric
test statistics were used when normal distribution of analysis
results could not be proven. For a detailed account of n-numbers
for each trial and analysis see Supplementary Table 2. All data
in main figures and Supplementary figures represent means over
all cells and all trials in one session. Different mice and imaging
sessions on different days were taken as independent samples.

Figure 1). The head-plates are mounted on top of a cranial
window that was implanted as previously described (Margolis
et al., 2012; Figure 1B). As a reporter of neuronal activity,
we selected the ratiometric Ca2+ indicator YC2.60, because
of its high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR = 4.3 for single
action potential detection) (Yamada et al., 2011), with rise
and decay times of 185 ms/10 APs and 2.31 s/10 APs as
measured in layer 2/3 cortical neurons in vitro (Yamada et al.,
2011). YC2.60 is thus ideally suited to detect sparse activity
patterns in layer 2/3 somatosensory cortex in vivo (Hendel
et al., 2008; Yamada et al., 2011). For cell type specific
gene delivery, we generated a recombinant adeno-associated
virus (rAAV) equipped with a CAG promoter driving the
expression of YC2.60 (rAAV-CAG-YC2.60) (Figure 1C). The
virus (rAAV-CAG-YC2.60) was unilaterally injected into the
barrel cortex of 6–7 weeks old C57BL/6N mice (Figures 1D,E).
Immunofluorescence analysis showed that rAAV-CAG-YC2.60
provided expression predominantly in neuronal cells; only a

Anesthesia Causes a Dose-Dependent
Increase in Neuronal Synchrony
To
investigate
the
effects
of
different
anesthetics
on
stimulus-induced and spontaneous cortical neuronal activity, we
performed repeated in vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging sessions
of approximately the same regions in layer 2/3 of the barrel
cortex of the same mice under different anesthetic conditions
(see
Section
Materials
and
Methods).
We
approximated
the anesthetic state via a behavioral scoring system (see
Supplementary Table 1). We found that under a low isoflurane
concentration (0.5%), activity in neuronal populations was sparse
and desynchronized (Figures 2A,B), and quite similar to that
observed in the awake state (Greenberg et al., 2008). However,
increasing isoflurane doses to 1.5–2.0% (High Isoflurane) caused
marked changes in network dynamics; activity of nearly all
neurons became highly synchronized (Figures 2A,B). This
could not be attributed to a general increase in neural activity,
which would increase correlation by simply augmenting the
chance of simultaneous detection of Ca2+ events (Figure 2C,
ANOVA, p = 0.68, p > 0.05 for Dunnett’s multiple comparison
test for all datasets vs. Low Iso). Interestingly, under 1.0%

between stimulation groups and isoflurane treatments are marked in the figure). The differences in sensory responsiveness at low isoflurane vanished when the
stimulus detection windows were randomized within datasets (RND) (see Section Materials and Methods) (mean ± SEM, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).
isoflurane (Medium Isoflurane), network dynamics were not
significantly altered (Figures 2D–F), although the animal lost
consciousness and transitioned into a deeper anesthetic state
(see Section Materials and Methods and Supplementary Table
1). To quantify the observed synchronization between neuron
pairs, we calculated Pearson’s linear correlation coefficient
(Pearson’s r), which was significantly increased under 1.5–2%
isoflurane (correlations were pre-filtered for a significance level
of p < 0.05, see Section Materials and Methods for details,
Figure 2D, ANOVA p
=
0.0027, significance level of 0.01,
Dunnett’s multiple comparison test: p < 0.01 for High Iso
vs. Low Iso). To determine if the network effects under high
isoflurane concentrations are reversible, we switched back to
0.5% isoflurane (Recovery Isoflurane). Thirty minutes later, we
found that values for pairwise correlation were similar to those
observed under the initial low isoflurane dose (Figure 2D, 6143
± 1220 cell pairs (mean ± SEM), Dunnett’s multiple comparison
test: p > 0.01 for Low Iso vs. Recovery Iso). These results indicate
that the effects of isoflurane on cortical network activity are
reversible within a short time period and add support for using
isoflurane during surgical procedures and for the investigation of
experience dependent cortical plasticity (Margolis et al., 2012). It
is possible that the increased synchrony under a high isoflurane
dose (1.5–2.0%) might be due to enhanced neural responses
to sensory stimuli under anesthesia (Zandieh et al., 2003),
which would lead to increased detection of simultaneous Ca2+
events within the same time windows. To address this issue, we
subtracted all stimulus related peaks from the unfiltered data
sets, and re-analyzed Pearson’s r (-stim events, Figure 2E). The
results for the -stim events data were almost identical to those
described for the complete trial data (Figure 2E, mean number
of trials: 11.32 SD ± 5, 7 mice. All events: Mann–Whitney, p =

0.0002; High Iso vs. Low Iso, p = 0.0033; High Iso vs. Recovery
Iso. -stim events data: Mann–Whitney, p = 0.0017; High Iso
vs. Low Iso, p = 0.0161; High Iso vs. Recovery Iso). We also
included trials under a high isoflurane concentration in which
the air-puff was turned off and only the air-puff trigger sound
was active (see Section Materials and Methods for details). Under
this condition as well, Pearson’s r was not significantly different
from the complete trial value (Figure 2E, right, Sound only). The
trials with subtracted stimulus peaks and the ones with sound
only stimulation showed no significant differences to the regular
trial set (Figure 2E, mean number of trials: 9.58 ± 4 (mean ±
SEM), 3 mice, All events vs. -stim events: Mann-Whitney, p =
0.58, All events vs. Sound only: Mann-Whitney, p = 0.43). Thus,
the increased synchrony under a high isoflurane dose is not due
to an enhancement of neural responses to sensory stimuli.
Next, we asked whether the pairwise correlation of two
active neurons was dependent on their spatial distance. We
calculated Pearson’s r for discrete distance bins (Figure 2F) and
found that neuronal activity was only correlated up to 200 µm
between neurons, with higher distances (>200 µm) not showing
significant differences in correlation compared to control (2-way
ANOVA with Bonferroni multiple comparisons: Low Iso and
Medium Iso vs. High Iso ∗∗∗p < 0.001 for 0–175 µm, ∗p < 0.05
for 175–200 µm, and p > 0.05 for 200–225 µm, Recovery Iso vs.

effect of distance: F = 4.41, DFn = 8, DFd = 433, p < 0.0001).
To determine whether the observed effects on neuronal
network dynamics are specific to isoflurane or whether
they represent a common feature of general anesthesia,
we
investigated
the
effects
of
ketamine,
urethane,
and
ketamine/xylazine on activity patterns of neurons and compared
those to the pattern recorded under low isoflurane (Figure 3).
For ketamine, we intraperitoneally injected mice with an initial
dose of 130 mg/kg body weight followed by another injection of
50 mg/kg 5 min before imaging. Similar to the high isoflurane
concentration, pairwise correlation increased compared to the
low isoflurane condition (Figures 3A,B, 3948 sampled cell
pairs, ANOVA p < 0.0001, significance level of 0.01, Dunnett’s
multiple comparison test p < 0.001 for Ketamine only vs. Low
Iso) although the magnitude of the effect was smaller than
for high isoflurane concentrations. Interestingly, this effect
was diminished when xylazine was included in the ketamine
injection cocktail (Figures 3A,B, K + X, 4892 sampled cell pairs,
Dunnett’s multiple comparison test, p > 0.01).
Finally, we used urethane as another chemically distinct
anesthetic. One urethane injection of 1.5 mg/kg body weight
significantly increased Pearson’s r (Figures 3A,B, Urethane 1,
360 sampled cell pairs, Dunnett’s multiple comparison test, p <
0.001). After 1 and 2 h, mice were given an additional dose of
urethane (0.7 g/kg) and the data from these two injections were
pooled. These additional injections led to a further increase in
pairwise correlations (Figures 3A,B, Urethane >1, 2621 sampled
cell pairs, Dunnett’s multiple comparison test, p < 0.001).
Next, we analyzed whether general anesthesia changed the
number of detected events per trial compared to the low
isoflurane (Low Iso) condition (Figure 3C, Number of events).
Here, we only observed changes in trials of mice that received
one urethane injection, with a significant reduction in number
of detected peaks (ANOVA, p = 0.061, Dunnett’s multiple
comparison test p < 0.05 for Urethane 1 vs. Low Iso).
When analyzing the average amplitudes of all Ca2+ transients
(Figure 3C, All Events), we found a significant decrease for
ketamine, ketamine/xylazine as well as for one urethane injection
(ANOVA, p = 0.0003, Dunnett’s multiple comparison test p <
0.05 for K only, K+X, and Urethane 1 vs. Low Iso). Although
there was a trend toward lowered stimulus response amplitudes
(Figure 3C, Stim Events) for these same conditions, statistical
significance was not reached when compared to the Low Iso
dataset (ANOVA, p = 0.028, Dunnett’s multiple comparison test
p > 0.05 for all datasets vs. Low Iso). Thus, deep anesthesia
induced by high-dose isoflurane, ketamine, ketamine/xylazine,
and multiple urethane treatments did not change the peak
frequency or peak amplitude of stimulus induced Ca2+ transients
in layer 2/3 neurons of the somatosensory cortex. However,
deep anesthesia was accompanied by drastically enhanced
synchronous Ca2+ activity patterns under all tested conditions
except under ketamine/xylazine (K+X).
Isoflurane Anesthesia Increases the
Fraction of Stimulus Responsive Neurons
and Induces a Breakdown in
Modality-Specificity of Stimulus
Responses
We next investigated how isoflurane anesthesia affects the
number of whisker-evoked Ca2+ transients in layer 2/3 cortical
neurons of the barrel cortex (Figure 4). We found that under a
low isoflurane concentration (0.5%), which induced sedation, 17
± 2% (Mean ± SEM) of cells responded to whisker stimulation
by an air-puff (Figure 4C, Whisker Puff). However, under high
isoflurane concentrations (1.5–2.0%), the fraction of neurons
responding to whisker stimulation increased significantly to
33 ± 5% (Mean ± SEM) (p = 0.01, Unpaired t-test with
Welch’s correction). When animals were switched back to
0.5% isoflurane, the fraction of whisker-evoked responding cells
returned back to 18 ± 3% (Mean ± SEM) (p = 0.03, Unpaired
t-test with Welch’s correction) indicating that deep anesthesia
decreases the response specificity of somatosensory neurons by
rendering previously unresponsive neurons sensitive to sensory
stimuli.
We next investigated the specificity of neuronal responses to
sensory modality in layer 2/3 barrel cortex by testing different
concentrations of isoflurane for sound evoked responses in the
barrel cortex (see Methods for details). Under a low isoflurane
concentration (0.5%), there was a significant difference between
the air puff-evoked neuronal responses [Figures 4B,C, Whisker
Puff, 17 ± 2% (Mean ± SEM)] and those evoked by sound
alone [Sound only, 7 ± 2% (Mean ± SEM)], which indicates that
the barrel cortical neurons in layer 2/3 were highly responsive
to whisker stimulation (and not sound) under low isoflurane
(p = 0.015, unpaired t-test, Welch’s correction). However,
under high isoflurane concentrations (1.5–2.0%), this difference
vanished, because the overall neuronal response probability to

the sound stimulus increased steeply [25 ± 11% (Mean ±
SEM), p = 0.6 for high isoflurane Whisker Puff vs. Sound
only, unpaired t-test, Welch’s correction]. Although there was
a trend toward reversibility at 0.5% isoflurane, this did not
reach statistical significance, indicating that sensory responses
during the recovery trials were still compromised (Recovery Iso,
Whisker Puff vs. Sound only, p = 0.2). As a further control
experiment, we analyzed the recorded data again, but this time
randomized the whisker-stimulus and sound-stimulus detection
time windows (Figure 4C, see Section Materials and Methods
for details). At 0.5% isoflurane, there was a clear difference in
the fraction of stimulus responsive cells between the real trials
and the randomized (RND) trials (Whisker vs. Whisker RND at
Low Iso: n = 22, p = 0.0062, unpaired t-test, Welch’s correction),
supporting the conclusion that the air-puff onto whiskers
induced specific sensory responses in layer 2/3 barrel cortical
neurons. At high isoflurane doses, the fraction of responsive
cells for the randomized trials remained low (Whisker RND vs.
Whisker at High Iso: n = 12, p = 0.0005, unpaired t-test, Welch’s
correction), indicating that the heightened sensory responses
were real and not an artifact generated by a higher number
of spontaneous peaks occurring during the stimulus detection
interval. Although the same trend was visible for the sound only
dataset at high isoflurane (Sound only vs. Sound RND), these
results did not reach significance (p = 0.23, unpaired t-test,
Welch’s correction). Our results therefore further support the
hypothesis that deep isoflurane anesthesia induces a broadening
of neuronal responses to tactile stimuli in layer 2/3 of the barrel
cortex and increases responsiveness of these neurons to auditory
stimuli.
DISCUSSION
Here we demonstrated the usefulness of in vivo two-photon
imaging with the GECI YC2.60 for studying the effects of general
anesthetics on visually identified neurons in the barrel cortex of
mice. Previous studies used either large scale approaches such
as surface EEG recordings (Supp et al., 2011) or smaller scale
methods of unidentified neurons such as electrophysiological
unit recordings (Erchova et al., 2002) to investigate similar
phenomena. We fill this gap by measuring the effects of
anesthesia on up to 30 visually identified barrel cortex neurons
simultaneously. Our high-resolution imaging paradigm holds
promise for future studies as it allows the detailed dissection of
the effects of anesthesia on different cell types, both excitatory
and inhibitory neurons (Taub et al., 2013), as well as astrocytes
(Thrane et al., 2012). It is known that general anesthetics
can provoke short- and long-lasting effects (Perouansky and
Hemmings, 2009), including dementia (Kapila et al., 2014).
Chronic in vivo two-photon imaging as used in our study will
enable the monitoring of the same cells over a period of hours
on the same day and over many days (Margolis et al., 2012). In
addition, the inducible gene deletion technology using AAV to
delete specific target genes in selective brain region(s) (Hasan
et al., 2013; Dogbevia et al., 2015) will help to link the role of
gene function to changes in circuit dynamics induced by general
anesthetics in individual cells and entire neuronal networks over
time.
Here, we have shown that different general anesthetics
(isoflurane, ketamine and urethane) induce local neuronal
synchrony in layer 2/3 of the somatosensory cortex similar
to results of Ca2+ imaging studies in the visual cortex of
mice (Goltstein et al., 2015). In line with previous findings
(Erchova et al., 2002) the observed correlation in neuronal
activity of layer 2/3 neurons in the cortex under anesthesia
was highest between nearby neurons. Synchronized network
activity under anesthesia in the form of burst suppression (BS)
patterns in EEG recordings has been studied in various animal
models. While BS patterns have been examined extensively
in vitro as well as in vivo using electrophysiological methods
and modeling approaches (Ching et al., 2012; Bojak et al.,
2015), the physiological and cellular mechanisms underlying
their development are still not well understood (Bojak et al.,
2015). We propose that our methodology, combined with genetic
targeting of specific neuronal subtypes will enable the detailed
interrogation of network mechanisms that lead to the emergence
and after-effects of these patterns over different time scales
(sub-second to weeks). In vitro studies in cortical slices and in
vivo studies in rodents and cats using thalamic lesions suggest
that such activity patterns might be generated in the cortex
(Steriade et al., 1993; Sanchez-Vives and McCormick, 2000;
Constantinople and Bruno, 2011; Stroh et al., 2013), possibly
by pyramidal neurons in infra-granular cortical layers (Stroh
et al., 2013; Sitdikova et al., 2014). Although pharmacological
studies suggest the dependence of the observed activity patterns
on specific receptor activity (Steriade et al., 1994; Lukatch et al.,
2005; Kroeger and Amzica, 2007), it is still unclear which cell
types and specific mechanism(s) are involved in the emergence
of these activity patterns. Moreover, GABAAR agonists (Lukatch
et al., 2005) as well as suppression of inhibition (Ferron et al.,
2009) produced similar activity patterns in response to anesthetic
agents. We propose that cellular resolution 2P in vivo Ca2+
imaging together with the ability to target specific cell types via
GECIs such as YC2.60 can greatly advance our understanding of
the emergence of BS and slow wave patterns in cortical networks
under anesthesia and in other conditions like sleep and coma.
Furthermore, the role of synchrony in conscious perception
has long been debated, but it is important to distinguish
between different spatial scales of synchrony, ranging from
correlated activity of different brain regions on one side to
synchrony in highly localized neuronal networks on the other
side. It has been proposed that certain forms of long-range
synchronization between different brain regions might bind
various sensory responses to a coherent perceptual experience
(Engel and Singer, 2001). It was also proposed that certain
forms of excessive interregional neuronal synchronization under
anesthesia disrupt meaningful information processing and to
induce unconsciousness (Supp et al., 2011). Our results provide
further evidence for the commonness of local, short-range
synchrony during most anesthetic treatments (Erchova et al.,
2002). However, we also note that animals showed decreased
spontaneous movements under certain anesthetic treatments,
which did not induce neural synchrony (i.e., ketamine/xylazine
Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org

 Lissek et al.
Anesthesia Changes Neuronal Network Parameters
and 1% isoflurane). This indicates that the increase in correlation
observed in our experiments and previous studies might not be
necessary for the loss of consciousness.
One caveat is that different anesthetics in our study might
have influenced Ca2+ signaling and thus GECI signals that are
independent of neuronal spiking activity. However, a previous
study has shown that Ca2+ transients measured by GECIs
correlate to action potentials under deep anesthesia (Lütcke
et al., 2010). We also think it is unlikely that the correlated
Ca2+ transients under deep anesthesia are caused by simple
changes in Ca2+ signaling efficiency, as the transients retain
the characteristic shape of fast rise and slow-exponential decay
times indicative of Ca2+ transients caused by neuronal spiking.
The considerations on Ca2+ signaling efficiency might be most
relevant to evaluation of transient amplitudes in Figure 3.
However, our Ca2+ imaging data is in line with previous findings
that used purely electrophysiological recordings, which further
supports that changes in Ca2+signals in our study are due to
changes in neuronal spiking.
In addition to its effects on synchrony, we found that
high dose isoflurane profoundly increased the fraction of
whisker-responsive neurons in layer 2/3 of the somatosensory
cortex, possibly rendering previously unresponsive neurons
sensitive to sensory stimuli. Moreover, we show that this
process is reversible, since lowering the isoflurane concentration
decreased the fraction of whisker responsive cells back to
initial values. It is unclear which network mechanisms underlie
the observed effects. One possible explanation is that the
altered network response is caused by a breakdown of local
inhibition, which would normally confine the neuronal responses
to individual neurons, thereby favoring sparse firing patterns
over the synchronized responses in local neuronal networks. We
cannot exclude, however, that the anesthesia-induced changes in
network wide synchrony are caused by a downstream network.
Indeed our results bear similarity to the broadening of thalamic
receptive fields under anesthesia (Friedberg et al., 1999).
The above results are also interesting in light of previous
work reporting a contraction of cortical whisker fields under
urethane anesthesia (Erchova et al., 2002). This report found
that barrel cortex neurons become less responsive to whisker
deflections in adjacent barrels which was interpreted as a decrease
in overall barrel cortex responsiveness thereby contradicting our
results. However, one discrepancy lies in the anesthetic used.
Here, we use isoflurane while Erchova et al. used urethane
which might explain differences in experimental observations
because different anesthetics, although both enhancing neuronal
synchrony, might affect sensory responses in distinct manners.
Also, our field of view is smaller (max. 200 µm) than the cell pairs
recorded in the aforementioned study (400 µm interelectrode
distance) and it might be that neurons in the immediate vicinity
of the barrel center might become more responsive while neurons
further away become less responsive (i.e., the whisker territory
retracts, but neurons within the now smaller area become more
responsive to sensory stimuli). Also, in the previous report,
recordings were performed in infragranular layers whereas we
record in supragranular layer 2/3 and it might thus be possible
that different neuronal subtypes respond differently to anesthetic
treatment. In support of our findings of increased and unspecific
neuronal responses, a previous report has shown that neurons in
adjacent barrel columns become more responsive under urethane
anesthesia (Simons et al., 1992).
Not only did whisker-evoked neuronal responses in the layer
2/3 barrel cortex in our study become more diffuse under
anesthesia, but neurons also responded to a tone stimulus.
Similar to our observation of sound-evoked responses in the
barrel cortex, previous studies reported sensory stimulus evoked
neuronal responses under deep anesthesia in cortical areas other
than those directly linked to the processing of the specific
stimulus quality (Land et al., 2012). Together these results
provide strong evidence for the distortion of dedicated sensory
boundaries in the cortex under anesthesia. In contrast to
the fraction of layer 2/3 neurons that responded to whisker
stimulation, tone-induced neuronal responses in the barrel
cortex were not completely reversible within a recovery period
of about 1 h, which hints toward a slow reconstitution of these
boundaries after deep anesthesia.
It is tempting to speculate that a breakdown in the
multimodal sensory signal transduction in the anesthetized
cortex is physiologically related to the pathophysiological state
as described in synesthesia, a condition where stimulation of
one sense leads to an involuntary and simultaneous perception
within another sense, for example, auditory stimulus evoked
visual responses (Harvey, 2013). Anesthesia and synesthesia
might share certain cellular mechanisms, such as increased
synchrony (Harvey, 2013) or modulation of inhibitory neural
activity (Terhune et al., 2014) that lead to a breakdown of sensory
boundaries. Therefore, two-photon Ca2+ imaging of sensory
circuits under anesthesia might also provide valuable insights
into the pathophysiology of synesthesia.
Notably, in the barrel cortex, astrocytic activity response
shows the opposite effect in deeply anesthetized mice to those
reported here. Synchronous activity of the glia network is
disrupted under deep anesthesia and astrocytic Ca2+ responses
are reduced (Thrane et al., 2012). Considering the delayed, but
well defined timing of the glia response to whisker induced
activity (Wang et al., 2006; Thrane et al., 2012), it seems quite
unlikely that the glia network is simply responding to local
neuronal action potentials. It is possible that the astrocytes
are integrating and responding to multiple local and global
neuronal activities. However, currently we cannot exclude that
the described glial responses to different anesthetic drugs
may constitute a non-neuronal mechanism for sedation and
unconsciousness.
We propose that our findings can guide the selection of
anesthetic treatments for future studies. We noted that an
isoflurane dose of 1.0% (which completely immobilized the
animal) did not change network parameters compared to the
sedated state (0.5% isoflurane) and might therefore be suited
for studies in which mice have to be immobilized during the
investigation of brain activity. Taken together with the quick
reversibility of its effects on neuronal activity as shown in our
study, we therefore recommend low dose isoflurane (0.5–1.0%) as
the anesthetic of choice for the investigation of neuronal sensory
processing in living mice.

Anesthesia Changes Neuronal Network Parameters
In conclusion, we propose that in vivo two-photon Ca2+
imaging of animals under different anesthetic conditions is
an attractive method for dissecting molecular and cellular
mechanisms surrounding anesthetic action and consciousness.
Studies examining anesthetic effects on neural networks can
provide important insight into the operation of circuit function
when consciousness is lost and regained. To identify molecular
targets and signaling pathways orchestrating the effects of
general anesthesia, it will be imperative to apply advanced
genetic tools for manipulating candidate gene(s) in local and
distributed brain circuits for future studies (Hasan et al.,
2013; Dogbevia et al., 2015). Optogenetic manipulation of
specific neuron classes in the cortex and/or projections from
other brain regions during two-photon activity imaging will
further help to dissect cellular and circuit dynamics of general
anesthesia.
