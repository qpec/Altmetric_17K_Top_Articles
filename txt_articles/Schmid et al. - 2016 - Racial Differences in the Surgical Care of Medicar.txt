cancer (PCa) have worse cancer-specific mortality compared to their non-Hispanic White (nHW) 
counterparts.
Objective—To evaluate racial disparities in the use, quality of care, and outcomes of radical 
prostatectomy (RP) in elderly men with non-metastatic PCa.
Design—Inclusion of patients with localized PCa who underwent RP within the first year of PCa 
diagnosis in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database between 
1991 and 2009.

 Setting—Retrospective analysis of outcomes stratified according to race (Black vs. nHW).
Participants—2,020 (7.6%) Black and 24,462 (92.4%) nHW elderly men with localized PCa 
who underwent RP.
Main Outcomes and Measures—Process of care (i.e. time to treatment, lymph node 
dissection), as well as outcome measures (i.e. complications, emergency department visits, 
readmissions, PCa-specific and all-cause mortality, costs) were evaluated using Cox proportional 
hazards regression. Multivariable conditional logistic regression and quantile regression were used 
to study the association of racial disparities with process of care and outcome measures.
Results—59.4% of Blacks vs. 69.5% of nHWs underwent RP within 90 days (p<.001); the top 
50% of Blacks had an 8-day treatment delay compared to nHW (p<.001). Blacks were less likely 
to undergo lymph node dissection and to receive blood transfusions, but more likely to experience 
postoperative complications, subsequent emergency department visits, and readmissions (all p<.
05). The surgical treatment of Black patients was associated with a higher incremental annual cost 
(top 50% spent $1185.5 more). There was no difference in PCa-specific mortality (p=.16) or all-
cause mortality (p=.64) between Black and nHW men.
Conclusions and Relevance—Blacks treated with RP for localized PCa are more likely to 
experience adverse events and incur higher costs compared to nHW men, however this does not 
translate into a difference in PCa-specific or all-cause mortality.

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently diagnosed non-cutaneous cancer in the male US 
population, with an estimated 233,000 new cases in 2014.1 The management of PCa is 
driven by many factors including the severity of disease at presentation. Definitive therapy 
for localized PCa with curative intent is performed with radical prostatectomy (RP), 
radiotherapy (RT), or combinations thereof, and has shown to decrease PCa-specific 
mortality and improve overall survival, especially in patients with intermediate to high-risk 
disease.2–6
Compelling data suggest that race and ethnicity strongly correlate with survival following a 
PCa diagnosis.7–12 Godley et al found that Blacks suffer from higher PCa-specific mortality 
compared to Whites,11 and this gap may be widening.13 The underlying reasons are unclear, 
but likely result from complex biological, cultural and sociodemographic differences. 
Nonetheless, there is evidence for a substantial disparity in the quality of received care. 
Some studies demonstrated substantial variability in treatment selection of racial and ethnic 
minorities, as well as inconsistency in outcomes of treatment.11,14–16 Underwood et al 
showed that Black and Hispanics were less likely to receive definitive therapy than 
Whites,10 which has prompted investigators to hypothesize that a large part of care 
disparities stem from lower rates of definitive treatment for Blacks.

 Based on these considerations, we assessed the effect of race on quality of care and survival 
of men receiving RP as definitive treatment of localized PCa. By restricting our cohort to a 
more homogeneous group of surgical candidates enrolled in Medicare, we sought to 
attenuate the effect of unmeasured confounders on the outcomes of treatment for PCa.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Population source
The current study used the most recent version of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End 
Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database. The SEER-Program provides information on 
cancer statistics in an effort to reduce the burden of cancer among the US population. The 
SEER collects incidence and population data associated by age, sex, race, clinical 
demographics, tumor characteristics, primary treatment and cause of death from cancer 
registries. A signed research data agreement is required to access these data. Linkage with 
Medicare claims for covered health care services provides data from the time of a person’s 
Medicare eligibility until death. The SEER database covers approximately 28% of the US 
population. For linkage, approximately 93% of men aged ≥65 years in the SEER files were 
matched to the Medicare enrollment file.17
Study cohort
The exclusion process for our cohort is illustrated in Figure 1. After selection, 26,482 men 
with localized PCa who underwent RP within the first year of PCa diagnosis remained for 
final analyses.
Definitive treatment within 12 months of diagnosis was assessed by searching inpatient 
claims from the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review file, based on ICD 9th Edition 
Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes, and physician claims in the Carrier Claims file, 
based on American Medical Association Current Procedural Terminology and ICD-9-CM 
codes for PCa diagnosis and procedure codes.
Covariates
For each patient, age, year of diagnosis, population density, marital status, 2000 census tract 
percent with 4-year college education, 2000 census tract annual median income and region, 
were assigned.18 Age was categorized into four groupings (<75, 75–79, 80–85, >85 years). 
The Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was derived from the Medicare claims one year prior 
to PCa diagnosis, using a previously validated algorithm.19 Additionally, Gleason score and 
American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) clinical stage were available. Prior to 2003, 
Gleason grade of 2–4, 5–7, and 8–10 corresponded to well, moderately, and poorly 
differentiated disease, respectively, whereas thereafter a Gleason grade of 2–4, 5–6, and 7–
10 corresponded to well, moderately, and poorly differentiated PCa, respectively. Clinical 
extension information provided by SEER was used to determine cancer stage (T1, T2, T3). 
Finally, patients were stratified into three risk groups for sensitivity analyses. Risk group 1 
consisted of localized (T1/T2) low-risk disease (well and moderately differentiated); risk 
group 2 consisted of localized (T1/T2) high-risk disease (poorly differentiated); and risk 
group 3 consisted of locally advanced (T3) disease of any grade

 Process of care and outcome measures
Relying on previous methodology,20 process of care measures included treatment type and 
time to treatment, as well as the use of additional cancer therapies (RT, androgen deprivation 
therapy [ADT]).16 Delayed treatment was defined as RP >3 month from PCa diagnosis to 
treatment.21 Furthermore, we included lymph node dissection (LND) as a quality of care 
measure.22 Sensitivity analyses restricted to individuals with intermediate and high-risk 
disease were also performed. Outcome measures consisted of complications, emergency 
department (ED) visits, readmissions, mortality within 30 days of surgery and thereafter 
(>30 days). We identified the following groups of complications: cardiac, respiratory, 
vascular, wound/bleeding, genitourinary, bowel, miscellaneous medical, and miscellaneous 
surgical.23
Long-term outcome measures consisted of PCa-specific- and all-cause mortality. Survival 
was determined by Medicare vital statistics as well as SEER linkage to death certificates 
(National Death Index). The effect of comorbidities on survival was estimated with Cox 
proportional hazards modeling and the weights for the individual comorbid conditions were 
comprised by coefficient estimates of the condition indicators.
Statistical analyses
The primary variable of interest in all models was race (Black vs. nHW). First, we analyzed 
the association between race and outcomes (complications, short-term mortality, number of 
readmissions and ED visits, PCa-specific mortality, and all-cause mortality). Summary 
statistics were constructed using frequencies and proportions for categorical variables, as 
well as medians and interquartile ranges for continuous variables. Categorical values were 
compared using chi-square, and continuous variables were compared with the Wilcoxon 
Rank sum test.
Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess PCa-specific mortality and all-cause 
mortality outcomes. Models were adjusted for age, martial, status, TNM stage, grade, CCI, 
census tract income and education quartile and urban vs. rural region of residence. 
Additional sensitivity analyses restricted to the first half of the study (1992–2000) were 
conducted to rule out that a lack of difference in survival was not simply a function of short 
follow-up.
To account for variation in treatment patterns between local treatment areas, we adjusted for 
health service areas (HSA). In particular, we assumed that the baseline hazard could be 
different across HSA and fitted a Cox model stratified by HSA (equivalent to treating HSA 
as a fixed effects).24 Similarly, logistic regression models accounted for HSA as a 
stratification variable and adjusted for all Table 1 covariates were used to model if race was 
a predictor for delayed treatment, additional cancer therapy, LND, any complications, 
readmission, or ED visits. Conditional logistic regression was used to eliminate the HSA 
stratification effect in the model. The parameters from the stratified Cox model and the 
conditional logistic regression model can be considered subject-specific parameters; as such, 
the estimates presented can be interpreted as hazard ratios (or odds ratios) of a patient dying,

 for a person of one race compared to a person identical on all other possible covariates 
except for race.
To ensure that the disparities in outcomes were not readily explained by surgeon 
characteristics, we compared surgeon caseload, experience and training between Blacks and 
nHWs. Physicians were identified in the Medicare Outpatient Statistical Analytical File and 
National Claims History claims using unique physician identifier numbers as previously 
described.25,26
Finally, quantile regression was used to determine the effect of race on conditional means of 
continuous outcomes. Outcomes of interest were: time from diagnosis to surgery (in days), 
time to RT, and annual incremental cost (determined by total healthcare spending the year 
after PCa diagnosis minus total healthcare spending in the year before diagnosis). We 
conducted sensitivity analyses by constructing weighted Cox proportional hazard models 
using inverse probabilities of race weights, which give additional weight to minority 
patients, derived from propensity scores based on the patient, hospital, and surgical 
characteristics mentioned above and found our Cox model results to be consistent.27
All statistical testing was two-sided with a level of significance set at 0.05. Analyses were 
performed using SAS, version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina). An institutional 
review board waiver was obtained prior to conducting this study, in accordance with 
institutional regulation when dealing with de-identified administrative data.
RESULTS
Study cohort characteristics
Between January 1992 and December 2009, 26,482 patients who underwent RP for 
localized PCa and met the inclusion criteria were recorded in SEER. Of these, 2,020 (7.6%) 
were Blacks and 24,462 (92.4%) were nHWs. Baseline characteristics are listed in Table 1. 
The proportion of Blacks undergoing surgery increased from 6.0 to 8.3% between 1992–
1999 and 2000–2009. Blacks were more likely to have more comorbidities (CCI ≥2, p<.
001), to reside in metropolitan areas (90.1 vs. 82.3%, p<.001), to reside in the south 
(38.9%), to be single (30.6 vs. 13.5%, p<.001), to not hold college education (12.8 vs. 
26.8%, p<.001), and to have a lower household income (34,884 vs. 50,662 USD, p<.001) 
than nHWs. Lower tumor stage (AJCC Stage I–II) was more prevalent in Blacks (75.1 vs. 
68.1%), whereas nHWs had a higher percentage of Stage III disease (31.9 vs. 24.9%, p<.
001). There was no significant difference in surgeon characteristics between the two groups.
Treatment and quality of care
On average, Blacks experienced a longer treatment delay than nHW men (mean 79 vs. 71 
days, p=.001; eTable1). In multivariate analyses, Blacks were less likely to receive RP 
within 3 months of diagnosis (Odds ratio [OR] (95% Confidence interval [CI]: 0.65 (0.59–
0.71), p<.001; Table 2) and the top 50% had an absolute treatment delay of 7 days (95% 
Confidence Limit [CL] 3.64–10.13, eTable 2). This difference persisted at 6 and 9 months, 
where 18.0 and 12.3% of Blacks vs. 11.0 and 7.0% of nHWs have not had surgery, 
respectively (p<.001). Overall, 57.7% of Blacks underwent surgery without further adjuvant

 therapy as compared to 61.3% nHWs (p=.001). In trend analyses of all patients undergoing 
RP from 1992–2009, this gap has prevailed since the late 1990’s (eFigure 1). When surgery 
was performed, Blacks were less likely to undergo LND compared to nHWs (52.8 vs. 
61.5%; OR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.65–0.8, p<.001). This difference persisted in sensitivity 
analyses restricted to patients with intermediate and high-risk disease (OR: 0.96, 95% CI: 
0.77–1.1, p=.33 and OR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.67–1.05, p=.13, respectively; data not shown). In 
univariate analyses, Black race was correlated with more postoperative complications, ED 
visits, readmissions, mortality and less transfusions (all p<.05; eTable 1). In multivariable 
analyses, Blacks had increased odds of ED visits within 30 days and >30 days following RP 
(OR: 1.48, 95% CI: 1.18–1.86 and OR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.19–1.8) and readmissions within 30 
days and >30 days (OR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.02–1.6 and OR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.07–1.51) 
compared to nHWs (Table 2, Figure 2).
With regard to additional cancer therapies, we recorded a significantly shorter period from 
PCa diagnosis to RT after RP for Black men in the top 50% of our cohort. Specifically, 
Blacks experienced RT about 95 days earlier compared to nHWs (CL: −149 to −42 days, p=.
001; eTable 2). They were also more likely to receive ADT (p=0.001). Additionally, once 
secondary cancer treatment (ADT, RT) was administered, time to treatment was significantly 
shorter than in nHW (eTable 1).
Median total calculated costs were 13,015 USD (IQR: 8,279–19,314) for Blacks compared 
with 15,758 USD (IQR: 8,439–17,080) for nHWs. The surgical management of Blacks was 
associated with higher incremental annual cost with the top 50% spending 1,186 USD more 
compared to nHWs (95% CI: 805–1,566; p<.001; eTable 2).
Overall and prostate cancer-specific mortality
With a mean follow-up of 81.4 months (IQR: 43.1–106) compared to 93.3 (IQR: 49.2–
127.4), unadjusted all-cause mortality, but not PCa-specific mortality, was significantly 
higher for Blacks compared to nHWs (HR: 1.097, 95% CI: 1.02–1.18, p=.02; data not 
shown), respectively. However, with adjustment for HSA, there was no difference in all-
cause (HR: 1.07, 95% CI: 0.97–1.17, p=.16) and PCa-specific mortality (HR: 1.07, 95% CI: 
0.8–1.4, p=.64; Table 3). In sensitivity analyses restricting the cohort to patients treated 
between 1992 and 1999, with a median follow-up of 150 months, race was not an 
independent predictor for all-cause (HR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.9–1.15, p=.78) and PCa-specific 
mortality (HR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.65–1.38, p=.77; data not shown).
COMMENT
There is abundant controversy vis-à-vis the gap in PCa outcomes between Blacks and 
nHWs. Whilst population-based data suggest higher PCa-specific mortality across all tumor 
stages for Blacks,28 reports originating from equal-access health care delivery systems have 
shown equivalent survival across all races after adjusting for stage at diagnosis and 
treatment.29 Consequently, Underwood et al speculated that the survival disparities originate 
from the receipt (or lack) of definitive treatment in Blacks and Hispanics.10 Over the past 
decade, disparities in definitive treatment decreased significantly in Hispanics, whereas they 
have persisted in Blacks.30 However, there is also biological evidence that PCa in Blacks is

 more aggressive than in nHWs, thus providing an alternate explanation for the differences. 
In the current article, we investigate disparities in elderly Black vs. nHW men who have 
chosen to undergo RP as definitive treatment for localized PCa.
Our study carries several major findings. First, we noticed a significant gap in of RP 
utilization between Blacks and nHWs. As postulated by Underwood and others10,31, this 
shortcoming is likely responsible for an important share of disparities in PCa survival 
between Blacks and nHWs. Most importantly, as derived from trend analyses, our findings 
suggest that this gap has not significantly improved over time, which raises concerns that 
this problem is not being adequately addressed.
Second, we identified significant differences in the quality of care received by Blacks 
relative to nHWs. For example, we found that Blacks were less likely to undergo pelvic 
LND at the time of surgery. Although LND may be safely avoided in the context of low-risk 
disease, there are clear recommendations mandating a template lymphadenectomy for 
patients with a predicted probability of lymph node invasion above 2%,32,33 which translates 
into the need for LND in most patients with intermediate and high-risk disease. In adjusted 
analyses of these subsets of patients, the disparities persisted. However, when we accounted 
for regional patterns of care by adjusting for HSA, Blacks with intermediate and high-risk 
disease were just as likely to undergo LND. Such findings emphasize that the geographic 
variation in quality of care is tightly linked to racial disparities, and may thus account for a 
significant proportion of the differences.34 Moreover, we found a difference in the time from 
diagnosis to treatment between Blacks and nHWs. While the difference was clinically small 
(8 days, p=.001), this may be most significant in those with locally advanced disease. 
Indeed, O’Brien et al demonstrated, that treatment delay >6 months led to pathological 
upgrading, worse RP outcomes and higher rate of biochemical recurrence (BCR) in 
localized PCa.35 Finally, we showed that racial disparities in pre- and perioperative care 
persist in surgical postoperative outcomes. In our study, Blacks had higher rates of ED visits 
and readmissions. The differences in comorbidities may ascertain for higher postoperative 
health care utilization rates among Blacks, as described previously.20,31,36 However, our 
findings are significant as they account for measured confounders with multivariable 
adjustment, as well as other unmeasured confounders, given that individuals deemed ‘unfit’ 
for surgery were excluded. In sensitivity analyses, we could not find significant differences 
in surgeon caseload, experience or training between Blacks and nHWs. Therefore, the gap in 
perioperative outcomes could not be attributed to differences in provider characteristics.
In addition to poorer quality of care and postoperative outcomes, our study finds that the 
cost of care for Blacks treated with RP is higher than in nHWs. As modest projections 
suggest that cost for PCa care will reach 18 billion USD by the end of this decade,37 
important work needs to be done to optimize and improve the value of PCa treatment 
paradigms. Much of the burden in increased costs has been attributed to the adoption of new 
technologies like robotic surgery or proton-beam therapy.38 Although access to these 
technologies might be improving, the data is adamant that Blacks are in fact still 
discriminated from such new technologies.39 Therefore, it is unlikely that such phenomenon 
is responsible for the increased financial burden of RP in Blacks. A careful examination of 
the data would suggest that the more prevalent use of RT and ADT in Blacks may be partly

 responsible.40 Moreover, indicators of poorer quality of care like increased rates of ED visits 
and readmissions in Blacks may also ascertain for the increased expenditures.
The next major finding of our study shows that, despite important constellations of poor 
quality of care for Blacks undergoing RP, we did not detect significant differences in overall 
and cancer-specific survival. This is a remarkable shift from the generally accepted 
paradigm of worse PCa-survival in Blacks. However, most studies supporting these claims 
were unable to adjust for significant predictors of survival, and were subject to many 
unmeasured confounders which may have affected oncological outcomes.41,42 Indeed, by 
excluding men who refused/were not offered surgical treatment for PCa, we are selecting a 
cohort of individuals of Black men who may be more directly comparable to nHWs than in 
previous studies, as they were deemed ‘fit’ for surgery. In those who make it to the operating 
table, despite poorer surgical quality of care as elucidated above, their survival rates were 
equivalent. To account for the relatively short follow-up (7.6 years), we performed 
sensitivity analyses restricting the cohort to patients diagnosed between 1992–1999 (mean 
follow-up 12.5 years); our findings were similar with regards to overall (p=.78) and PCa-
specific mortality (p=.77), which is quite significant: even in earlier years, no significant 
disparity in long-term oncological outcomes were detected in this subset of patients. Finally, 
we examined the regional variation in mortality within our cohort. Although worse overall 
survival for Blacks was recorded in the South (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.06–1.5, data not shown), 
no difference was found between regions with regard to PCa-specific mortality. The 
difference in overall mortality shown here is consistent with previous evidence,43 however 
the lack of regional variation with regard to PCa-specific mortality further reinforces our 
findings. A possible interpretation of our findings is that the biological differences in tumor 
aggressiveness among Blacks may have been exaggerated, and that the perceived gap in 
survival is a result of lack of access or cultural perceptions with regard to surgical care for 
PCa or other factors that differentiate who makes it to the operating table.
Despite its strengths, our study has limitations, which are inherent to retrospective, 
observational studies relying on SEER-Medicare. Several key unmeasured confounders are 
not captured in administrative claims and may cause an underestimation of the severity of 
comorbidities.44,45 While Blacks had less severe disease characteristics than nHWs, the 
exclusion of patients who refused or were not offered treatment may have introduced a bias 
by selecting only the healthiest Blacks for surgery. Although evidence for provider-specific 
screening and treatment recommendation disparities exist in PCa46,47, this issue was outside 
the scope of this study. However, the contingent provider-specific selection bias would lead 
to selection of surgical patients with favorable unmeasured disease characteristics such as 
tumor volume, PSA, and number of positive cores. The lack of such preoperative 
characteristics may impede primary and secondary treatment choices after BCR. While our 
analyses adjusted for all available socioeconomic confounders, unmeasured 
sociodemographic variables other than race may explain the observed differences between 
Blacks and nHWs.48,49 It is important to consider that our study comprises only traditional 
Medicare enrollees >65 years, thus limiting the general application of our findings. 
Specifically, we acknowledge that most men undergoing RP are younger and hold private 
insurance. Thus, our findings may not be applicable to the general population of men 
undergoing RP

 To summarize, we provide robust evidence for the existence of a substantial difference in the 
quality of surgical care of PCa in Blacks. As the unfavorable quality of care did not translate 
into worse overall and cancer-specific survival in our sample, the commonly perceived 
detrimental survival in Black PCa patients may be the sequelae of barriers and selection bias 
in definitive treatment. The public and professional awareness needs to be raised to address 
these concerning issues and identify their underlying causes.
