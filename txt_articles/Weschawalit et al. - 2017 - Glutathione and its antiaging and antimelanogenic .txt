Background: Previous studies showed that supplementation of reduced form of glutathione 
(GSH, 500 mg/d) has a skin-lightening efficacy in humans. This study was designed to evalu-
ate the influences of both GSH and oxidized form (GSSG), at doses lower than 500 mg/d, on 
improving skin properties.
Patients and methods: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, three-arm 
study was conducted. Healthy female subjects were equally randomized into three groups 
and took GSH (250 mg/d), GSSG (250 mg/d), or placebo orally for 12 weeks. At each visit at 
baseline and for 12 weeks, skin features including melanin index, wrinkles, and other relevant 
biophysical properties were measured. Blood samples were collected for safety monitoring.
Results: In generalized estimating equation analyses, melanin index and ultraviolet spots of 
all sites including face and arm when given GSH and GSSG tended to be lower than placebo. 
At some sites evaluated, subjects who received GSH showed a significant reduction in wrinkles 
compared with those taking placebo. A tendency toward increased skin elasticity was observed 
in GSH and GSSG compared with placebo. There were no serious adverse effects throughout 
the study.
Conclusion: We showed that oral glutathione, 250 mg/d, in both reduced and oxidized forms 
effectively influences skin properties. Overall, glutathione in both forms are well tolerated.

Introduction
The quest for means to alter skin color is endless. Caucasians seek ways to tan their 
skin, while many darker skin-type individuals are always in search of whitening or 
lightening agents.
Numerous topical agents available for melasma treatment are also used to lighten 
the skin color. However, as many people would prefer their skin to be thoroughly 
fairer, oral or even intravenous agents are administered to obtain these results. One 
of the widely used, systemic agents is glutathione, a thiol compound and one of the 
regulators of melanogenic pathway in the human system.
Glutathione is an antioxidant present in almost every cell in the body, playing a 
role in the detoxification of drugs and xenobiotics.1 Furthermore, reduced glutathione 
(GSH) acts as a hydrogen donor in the detoxification of hydrogen peroxide.2 As a 
dietary supplement, GSH possesses various systemic effects such as improvement of 
liver abnormalities,3,4 improvement of diabetic complication,5 protection from viral 
infection,6 and antitumor activity.7,8 It is even used to treat autism.9

Weschawalit et al
In vitro experiments have demonstrated that glutathione is 
related to melanogenesis.10–13 Its antimelanogenic properties 
result from a variety of mechanisms  
including stimulation 
of pheomelanin synthesis rather than darker eumelanin, its 
antioxidant effects,14 and interference with intracellular traf-
ficking of melanogenic enzymes.15 Glutathione also possesses 
certain antiaging properties.16
Glutathione is generally a safe ingredient for use as a 
dietary supplement. An oral acute toxicity study of GSH in 
mice found that the lethal dose 50 (LD50) was more than 5 g/
kg, indicating that glutathione is nontoxic. In many clinical 
trials, no serious adverse reactions have been observed.9,17–19 
On the contrary, it can even reverse the toxic effects following 
excessive intake of other amino acids.20
In the human body, glutathione exists in two forms, 
reduced and oxidized (GSSG), which can be readily con-
verted to each other. However, it is not clear whether the 
two forms are physiologically similar, especially when mela-
nogenesis is concerned. Moreover, efficacy and long-term 
safety of either form have not been examined systematically.
Glutathione is regarded as food or health supplements 
in several countries including the Philippines, Malaysia, 
Taiwan, and Thailand, while it is considered a pharmaceuti-
cal agent in Korea, Japan, and People’s Republic of China. 
Our group previously reported that oral GSH administration 
(500 mg/d) resulted in lightening of skin color, when given 
for 4 weeks.21 The main objective of this study was to find 
out whether glutathione, in the reduced and oxidized forms, 
maintains its skin-lightening efficacy when given at a dose 
of 250 mg/d for 12 weeks, a dosage allowed by the Thai and 
Taiwanese Food and Drug Administrations.
Patients and methods
study design
The study protocol was conducted in accordance with the 
Declaration of Helsinki, in compliance with the International 
Conference on Harmonization - Good Clinical Practice and 
reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board 
of Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University. Clinical 
study was conducted at Chula Clinical Research Center, Fac-
ulty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University. A randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel, three-arm study 
was applied. The subjects were equally block-randomized 
into three groups: GSSG (250 mg/d), GSH (250 mg/d), or 
placebo. Each subject received their assigned capsules in 
identical packages at weeks 0, 4, and 8, with 30 capsules 
per visit (two extra capsules per package). The subjects were 
informed to take the study capsules once before bedtime. 
Subjects returned for evaluations at weeks 4, 8, and 12.
Subjects
Sixty healthy volunteers, aged between 20 and 50 years, 
were eligible for this study. They were residents of Bang-
kok and recruited through the dermatology clinic at King 
Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital. Only female volunteers 
were enrolled to reduce gender variability and also because 
females are by far the majority of individuals who seek skin-
whitening agents. All volunteers were found to be healthy 
based on their medical history and physical and clinical 
laboratory examination including serology, hematology, and 
biochemistry tests. All volunteers had to abstain from other 
medications, supplementary vitamins, and alcohol intake for 
2 weeks prior to enrollment and throughout the study. The 
methods and conditions of the study were clearly explained 
to all volunteers. Signed written informed consent was 
obtained from each volunteer before screening processes for 
this study. However, each subject had the right to withdraw 
their consent at any time.
study medications
Daily doses of GSSG (AquaGluta™; 250 mg/d), GSH 
(Setria®; 250 mg/d), or dibasic calcium phosphate as placebo 
in identical capsules and packages were provided by Kyowa 
Hakko Bio Co., Ltd (Tokyo, Japan). The total weight of the 
three capsules for each group was the same.
Objective evaluation of skin properties
At each visit, subjects rested in a room controlled at a tem-
perature of 21 ± 3°C for 20 minutes before assessments. 
Prior to the evaluation, they washed their face with soap and 
water, pat-dried with paper towel, and waited 5–10 minutes 
for air drying.
Melanin index
For objective evaluation of skin color, melanin index as 
determined by Mexameter (Courage-Khazaka Electronic, 
Koln, Germany) was used as the primary outcome. All 
measurements were done in triplicate at six sites to repre-
sent the skin of the sun-exposed and sun-protected areas 
as follows:
1. Sun-exposed areas
•  
Face: left and right; 2.5 cm caudally from the lateral 
canthi.
•  
Extensor surfaces of the forearms, left, and right; 7 cm 
above the ulnar styloid processes.
2. Sun-protected areas
•  
Upper, inner arms, left, and right; 10 cm from the 
axillary vault.

glutathione as a skin-whitening agent
VIsIa
TM Cr system
Standardized digital photographs were taken by the VISIA
TM 
CR system (Canfield Scientific, Fairfield, NJ, USA), a software 
which was also used to quantitatively evaluate ultraviolet (UV) 
spots, pores, and evenness on the left and right sides of the face.
Transepidermal water loss (TeWl)
TEWL was measured using Tewameter® TM300 
(Courage+Khazaka Electronic GmbH, Köln, Germany). 
All measurements were done in triplicate at sites designated 
for melanin index to represent the skin of the sun-exposed 
and sun-protected areas.
Water contents (Corneometer)
Water contents were measured by Corneometer® CM825 
(Courage+Khazaka) in triplicate at sites as mentioned earlier.
elasticity
Elasticity was measured by Cutometer MPA580® 
(Courage+Khazaka) in triplicate at the sites mentioned 
previously.
Wrinkle
Wrinkle formation was objectively measured by Visioscan® 
(Courage+Khazaka).
Subjective evaluation of skin properties
For global evaluation, at each visit, subjects were asked 
to grade the overall response using a 4-point rating scale: 
4 = very satisfactory, 3 = moderately satisfactory, 2 = mini-
mally satisfactory, and 1 = not satisfactory. In the question-
naires, the following features/items were addressed: skin 
lightening, facial skin evenness, pigmented spots lightening, 
pore size improvement, skin smoothness, wrinkle reduction – 
crow’s feet, wrinkle reduction – nasolabial folds, wrinkle 
reduction – forehead, general skin condition, fatigability, 
sleep (e.g., quality and length)
safety
To evaluate the safety of subjects, vital signs were determined 
at each visit. Also, at all visits, a blood aliquot of 7 mL was 
drawn for complete blood cell counts, chemistry, and lactate 
dehydrogenase.
statistical analysis
Paired t-test was used to compare baseline values with 
those of the final visit. The generalized estimating equation 
(GEE) was performed to investigate how the efficacies of 
GSSG, GSH and placebo varied over time before and after 
treatment. Subjective evaluations of the two glutathione 
preparations and placebo were compared by analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA), with the baseline values as covari-
ates. Statistically significant level was defined as P-value 
<0.05 (two-tailed). Analyses were performed using STATA 
software version 11.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).
Results
Sixty volunteers were enrolled in the study. Three volunteers 
had to terminate, two due to elevation in liver function tests 
and one due to unanticipated start of oral contraceptive pills. 
Fifty-seven volunteers were included for final analysis. The 
majority of subjects had skin phototype IV (96.4%). Subjects’ 
demographic data are summarized in Table 1.
A total of 18 subjects received GSSG, 20 received GSH, 
and 19 received placebo. Mean baseline measurements 
(Mexameter, VISIA, Tewameter, Corneometer, Cutometer, 
Visioscan) in the three groups at six sites were not signifi-
cantly different (ANCOVA, P > 0.05).
The GEE was performed to investigate how the efficacies 
of GSSG, GSH, and placebo varied over time during treat-
ment (Table 2). As our subjects were recruited from a broad 
age range, we also decided to categorize the age groups into 
those younger and older than 40 years.

glutathione as a skin-whitening agent
placebo group (P = 0.006). This was also true for those aged 
>40 years when measurements were taken at the sun-exposed 
left forearm (P = 0.043). A similar trend was seen for GSH 
vs. placebo for the sun-protected left arm, in advanced age 
group (P = 0.066).
elasticity
Although statistically significant differences could not be 
demonstrated, GSSG and GSH supplementation tended to 
increase skin elasticity. Especially, the elasticity of sun-
exposed right face of those who received GSSG was notably 
higher than the elasticity of those who received placebo 
(P = 0.082).
Subjects were asked to fill the questionnaires to subjec-
tively evaluate skin properties at each visit. Satisfaction was 
scored as rating scale. There were no statistically significant 
differences in any of the ratings among the three groups 
(P > 0.05, ANCOVA).
Compliance
Compliance was not an issue in the present study. All subjects 
took the capsules as directed and assessed by the protocol 
throughout the study.
adverse events
Adverse reactions included pruritus, macular erythema, 
transient minute red spots on the skin, and tiredness. In the 
treatment groups combined (GSSG, GSH), these occurred 
in five patients (13.15%), which included three with pruritus 
(7.89%), one with erythema (2.63%), three with red spots 
(7.89%), and one with tiredness (2.63%). In the placebo 
group, there were two incidents of pruritus (10.52%), one 
erythema (5.26%), and three red spots (15.79%) (Table 3). 
No serious adverse events took place. The two incidents of 
transaminitis were temporary and the liver function tests 
returned to normal within a few weeks. Detailed blood 
parameters are described in Table 4.
Discussion
Our group has previously demonstrated that oral glutathi-
one, 500 mg/d, can reduce skin pigmentation after 4 weeks’

Melanin index
In all subjects with an age range between 20 and 50 years, GEE 
model showed that melanin index and UV spots of all sites 
including face and arm from GSSG and GSH groups tended to 
be lower than placebo group (Table 2) but were not statistically 
significant (P > 0.05). There were no significant differences 
between GSSG and GSH groups. The subgroup analysis of 
middle-aged individuals showed that the melanin index of sun-
exposed right forearm of subjects aged >40 years who received 
GSH (N = 7) was significantly lower than the index of those who 
received placebo (N = 10, P = 0.031). Melanin index measured 
at the sun-exposed left forearm from those receiving GSH was 
also lower than those receiving placebo. However, this did not 
reach statistically significant level (P = 0.057).
TeWl and water content
TEWL measurement of sun-exposed right forearm of the GSH 
group was significantly lower than that of GSSG group (P = 
0.044). However, the water contents of sun-protected left arm 
of those who received GSH were lower than that of those who 
received placebo (P = 0.031). This was also true for subjects 
aged >40 years, for the sun-exposed right face (P = 0.048).

Visioscan measurements of sun-protected left arm of subjects 
in the GSH group were significantly lower than those of the

administration in young, otherwise-healthy medical stu-
dents.21 Watanabe et al also demonstrated that topically 
applied GSSG can significantly reduce melanin indices.22 
Recently, Handog et al investigated the use of intraoral loz-
enge containing 500 mg of glutathione in an open-label study 
and demonstrated significant skin lightening after 8 weeks 
of administration.23
It is well established that glutathione can be transported 
across the intestinal epithelium after oral supplementation,9,19 
yet the fate of orally administered GSH is to be resolved as it 
is readily oxidized within the human body. On the contrary, 
its oxidized counterpart is much more stable. Until very 
recently, most studies were not able to detect blood or plasma 
glutathione, despite large doses of oral intake.17 However, 
Park et al demonstrated that although no glutathione could 
be measured in the whole plasma compartment, GSH could 
be detected in the protein-bound fraction of the human blood 
between 60 and 120 minutes after oral intake.24
In this study, we have demonstrated that both GSSG and 
GSH exerted their effects on melanin indices, which reached 
statistically significant levels at specific site and higher age 
group. This is in agreement, yet to some degree dissimilar, 
to our earlier study, the explanations for which are several-
fold. First, the dose of glutathione used in this study is half of 
that used in the prior study. This is to comply with the daily 
dosage of l-glutathione allowed in some countries includ-
ing Thailand. Second, the subjects recruited in this study are 
all females and of more advanced age. Interestingly, with 
subgroup analysis, the changes in subjects aged more than 
40 were even more pronounced than when the whole group 
was analyzed. Being affected with more photodamage can 
definitely affect the final outcomes measured, especially when 
pigment is concerned.
Our results also showed that GSH was significantly supe-
rior to placebo in its ability to improve wrinkles, at least at 
some anatomic locations. This is an extremely interesting 
and novel finding as cutaneous aging is a significant problem 
faced by the majority of people of any age. As the world’s 
populations are rapidly heading toward an aging society and 
human life spans are increasing, this problem will certainly 
be of greater magnitude in the foreseeable future. Having to 
apply topical antiwrinkle preparation to the entire skin is both 
costly and in many circumstances impractical for the elderly, 
especially when compared with popping a pill.
Also of importance are the findings that both forms of 
glutathione showed trends in increased skin elasticity at vari-
ous sites, both sun-exposed and sun-protected skin. These 
findings have never been reported before and deserve further 
investigations in larger populations.
Because glutathione has regulatory properties on mela-
nogenesis and antioxidants in general are protective against 
aging process, the “dual” antimelanogenic and antiaging 
properties demonstrated in Watanabe’s and our studies are 
not surprising. In fact, the link between melanization and 
aging has been studied in animal models.25
The strengths of our study are, first, objective and well-
standardized measurements. Second, a randomized, double-
blind study that analyzes the effect of glutathione in both 
reduced and oxidized forms in comparison with placebo has 
never been conducted. Limitations are that our subjects are 
all female, Asian, and of certain age range.
Overall, glutathione in both forms are well tolerated. No 
major adverse events took place during the study period. 
Increases in transaminases occurred in two subjects highlight-
ing the fact that blood chemistry should be performed even 
when individuals are taking over-the-counter supplements. 
Nonetheless, these adverse events were transient and the 
blood parameters promptly returned to their normal values 
upon cessation of consumption.

glutathione as a skin-whitening agent
Conclusion
In summary, we have shown that oral glutathione, 250 mg/d, 
in both reduced and oxidized forms have various beneficial 
effects on skin properties and is possibly an antiaging agent, 
at least in middle-aged female subjects. Further studies in 
larger and more diverse populations are warranted.
