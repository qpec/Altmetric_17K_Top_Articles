Abstract
Background
Economic incentives through health insurance may promote healthier behaviors. Little is
known about health and economic impacts of incentivizing diet, a leading risk factor for dia-
betes and cardiovascular disease (CVD), through Medicare and Medicaid.
Methods and findings
A validated microsimulation model (CVD-PREDICT) estimated CVD and diabetes cases
prevented, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), health-related costs (formal healthcare,
informal healthcare, and lost-productivity costs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios
(ICERs) of two policy scenarios for adults within Medicare and Medicaid, compared to a
base case of no new intervention: (1) 30% subsidy on fruits and vegetables (“F&V incen-
tive”) and (2) 30% subsidy on broader healthful foods including F&V, whole grains, nuts/
seeds, seafood, and plant oils (“healthy food incentive”). Inputs included national demo-
graphic and dietary data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) 2009–2014, policy effects and diet-disease effects from meta-analyses, and pol-
icy and health-related costs from established sources. Overall, 82 million adults (35–80
years old) were on Medicare and/or Medicaid. The mean (SD) age was 68.1 (11.4) years,
56.2% were female, and 25.5% were non-whites. Health and cost impacts were simulated
over the lifetime of current Medicare and Medicaid participants (average simulated years =
18.3 years). The F&V incentive was estimated to prevent 1.93 million CVD events, gain 4.64
million QALYs, and save $39.7 billion in formal healthcare costs. For the healthy food incen-
tive, corresponding gains were 3.28 million CVD and 0.12 million diabetes cases prevented,
8.40 million QALYs gained, and $100.2 billion in formal healthcare costs saved, respec-
tively. From a healthcare perspective, both scenarios were cost-effective at 5 years and
beyond, with lifetime ICERs of $18,184/QALY (F&V incentive) and $13,194/QALY (healthy

addition, JL was supported by a postdoctoral
fellowship award (17POST33670808) from the
 food incentive). From a societal perspective including informal healthcare costs and lost pro-
ductivity, respective ICERs were $14,576/QALY and $9,497/QALY. Results were robust in
probabilistic sensitivity analyses and a range of one-way sensitivity and subgroup analyses,
including by different durations of the intervention (5, 10, and 20 years and lifetime), food
subsidy levels (20%, 50%), insurance groups (Medicare, Medicaid, and dual-eligible), and
beneficiary characteristics within each insurance group (age, race/ethnicity, education,
income, and Supplemental Nutrition Assistant Program [SNAP] status). Simulation studies
such as this one provide quantitative estimates of benefits and uncertainty but cannot
directly prove health and economic impacts.
Conclusions
Economic incentives for healthier foods through Medicare and Medicaid could generate
substantial health gains and be highly cost-effective.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• In nearly all nations, healthcare spending continues to increase dramatically, with diet-
related conditions being a major driver.
• Fruit and vegetable (F&V) prescriptions and other incentives for healthier eating have
been implemented and proposed in healthcare systems but not at scale.
• Thus, the health impacts, costs, and cost-effectiveness of healthy food prescriptions in
healthcare are not well established.
What did the researchers do and find?
• As a part of the Food Policy Review and Intervention Cost-Effectiveness (Food-PRICE)
Project (www.food-price.org), we estimated the health and economic impacts of healthy
food prescriptions in Medicare and Medicaid, the two largest United States federal
health insurance programs, which together cover 1 in 3 US citizens.
• Using nationally representative data and a validated microsimulation model (CVD-
PREDICT), we evaluated two policy scenarios for adults in Medicare and Medicaid: (1)
a 30% subsidy on F&V (F&V incentive) and (2) a 30% subsidy on several healthful foods
including F&V, whole grains, nuts/seeds, seafood, and plant oils (healthy food
incentive).
• Over a lifetime, the F&V incentive would prevent 1.93 million cardiovascular disease
(CVD) events and 0.35 million CVD deaths and save $40 billion in healthcare costs. The
healthy food incentive would prevent 3.28 million CVD cases, 0.62 million CVD deaths,
and 0.12 million diabetes cases and save $100 billion in healthcare costs.
• Both programs were highly cost-effective from a healthcare perspective—with lifetime
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of $18,184 per quality-adjusted life year

 (QALY) for the F&V incentive and $13,194/QALY for the healthy food incentive—and
from a societal perspective (ICER: $14,576/QALY and $9,497/QALY, respectively).
• Results were consistent across subgroups within each insurance group including by age,

What do these findings mean?
• Implementing healthy food prescriptions within large government healthcare programs
to promote healthier eating could generate substantial health gains and be highly cost-
effective.
• Our findings support the implementation and evaluation of such programs within pri-
vate and public healthcare systems.
• In the US, a new $25 million Produce Prescription Program was just passed in the 2018
Farm Bill, which will provide funding support for such pilot projects over the next 5
years.
Introduction
US healthcare expenditures have tripled over 50 years, from 5% of gross domestic product in
1960 to 17.9% in 2016 [1]. Medicare and Medicaid are the nation’s two largest public insurance
programs [2], serving adults aged 65+ years, people with disabilities, and low-income popula-
tions. About 1 in 3 US citizens are covered by these insurance programs, which represent
about 25% of the entire federal budget [3]. Key health outcomes remain suboptimal [4] and
costs continue to rise [5], highlighting the need for new, cost-effective approaches.
Direct economic incentives to patients have been proposed through Medicare or Medicaid
to target traditional cardiometabolic risk factors and promote healthier behaviors, including
weight loss, cholesterol, blood pressure control [6,7], and also—now in the 2018 Farm Bill—
healthier eating [8]. Suboptimal diet is a leading risk factor for cardiometabolic diseases
including coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and type 2 diabetes [9,10] and has been linked
to nearly half of all estimated annual cardiometabolic deaths in the US [11]. Innovative health-
care strategies for better eating, such as fruit and vegetable (F&V) prescriptions and subsidies
[8,12], hold promise to reduce economic and health burdens from cardiometabolic diseases.
For example, the 2018 Farm Bill includes $25 million for a new Produce Prescription Program
to test healthcare interventions of financial or nonfinancial patient incentives to increase F&V
intake. Although research suggests healthy food subsidies are cost-effective outside of health-
care [13–15], the potential impacts on cardiometabolic health, healthcare costs, and cost-effec-
tiveness within healthcare are not well established.
To address these gaps in knowledge and inform health policy and future interventional
projects, we used a validated microsimulation model to estimate the potential cardiometabolic
health and economic impacts of a financial incentive program for healthful foods in Medicare
and Medicaid adult beneficiaries. This investigation was performed as a part of the Food Policy
Review and Intervention Cost-Effectiveness (Food-PRICE) Project (www.food-price.org).

 Methods
Study overview
The potential health and economic impacts of implementing a healthful food incentive pro-
gram through Medicare and Medicaid were modeled using the validated CVD-PREDICT
microsimulation model [16] in closed cohorts over 5, 10, and 20 years (2018–2037) and over
the lifetime of current participants. We obtained baseline characteristics, risks, dietary habits,
and disease incidence data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys
(NHANES) 2009 through 2014 cycles. The model utilized the national data to assess cumula-
tive cardiometabolic health outcomes and costs based on current trends as well as alternative
scenarios of specific interventions. At each stage of the logic pathway (S1 Appendix Fig A), the
best available evidence, supplemented with reasoned assumptions (S1 Appendix Table A), was
used to estimate the potential health and economic impacts of the proposed incentive program
in Medicare and Medicaid adult beneficiaries. The analysis plan is presented in S1 Appendix
Text A. Model inputs, sources, and key assumptions are described in detail below (Table 1).
Medicare/Medicaid policy scenarios
We modeled two distinct interventions within the Medicare/Medicaid program, compared
with a base case of no new intervention: (1) 30% subsidy on F&V (F&V incentive) and (2) 30%
subsidy on broader healthful foods (healthy food incentive) including F&V, whole grains, nuts/
seeds, seafood, and plant oils (see S1 Appendix Table B for dietary target details and definitions).
A secondary analysis was performed excluding incentives for seafood and plant oils, the two
most expensive food categories, from the healthy food incentive. The subsidy level of 30% was
based on the subsidy level used in the US Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) Healthy Incen-
tives Pilot (HIP), a randomized controlled trial implemented among Supplemental Nutrition
Assistant Program (SNAP) participants to incentivize F&V consumption [37].
We modeled the implementation of each intervention through adaptation of the existing
electronic benefits transfer (EBT) system, currently used for federal food-assistance programs
[38], for use in Medicaid and Medicare. Each beneficiary would receive an EBT card linked to
product-identifying universal product codes, subsidizing 30% of purchases of targeted foods at
point of purchase across diverse retail locations already accepting EBT. For example, for every
dollar spent on targeted healthful foods, $0.30 would be paid by the EBT card, with the remain-
ing $0.70 covered out of pocket.
Simulated US population
Our population was based on US adults aged 35–80 years at baseline across three cycles of
NHANES (2009–2014) and enrolled in Medicare and/or Medicaid, defined by reporting Medi-
care and/or Medicaid insurance coverage in the health insurance questionnaire. The sociode-
mographic characteristics and cardiometabolic risk factors of these participants were derived
from NHANES, including dietary habits from two 24-hour recalls as previously described
[39]. A simulated nationally representative Medicare, Medicaid, and dual-eligible population
of 1,000,000 individuals was generated by weighted sampling with replacement using
NHANES survey weights to account for the complex survey design and sampling [40]. All
individuals were simulated until death or age 100 years, whichever came first.

 healthful food in response to a 30% price change, differential price responsiveness by income
status, and the percentage of healthful food purchased at retail locations that would accept the
EBT card (e.g., supermarkets and grocery stores, as opposed to restaurants, cafeterias, and
food banks). Consistent with findings of studies using price changes to alter dietary behaviors
[18], we assumed the time lag between policy implementation and dietary changes occurred
within 1 year, with the intervention effect sustained throughout the subsidized period.
The effect of the price change on dietary intakes was derived from a systematic review and
meta-analysis of interventional and prospective observational studies of changes in food price
in relation to dietary consumption [18]. This meta-analysis demonstrated that each 1% change
in price results in a 1.24% change in intake of healthful foods. To account for differential price
responsiveness by socioeconomic status, we incorporated a proportional 18.2% higher price
responsiveness for lower- versus higher-income individuals (utilizing the family income

 eligibility threshold for government food-assistance programs, i.e., a poverty–income ratio
[PIR] of 1.3), based on a meta-analysis that compared price responses between lower- and
higher-income households within high-income countries [19]. We recognized that these esti-
mates represented the average policy effect in the population, accounting for higher or lower
effectiveness across different individuals. Of note, the resulting estimated effects on F&V
intake for a 30% subsidy based on these two meta-analyses (for PIR � 1.3, 30.9% for fruits and
23.7% for vegetables; and for PIR < 1.3, 35.2% and 28.7%, respectively) were comparable to
findings from the HIP trial (26% effect on combined F&V) [37].
Effects of dietary changes on cardiometabolic risk
Our detailed methods for reviewing and synthesizing the evidence to estimate effect sizes for
associations between dietary factors and cardiometabolic endpoints have been reported [9,11].
Meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies or randomized controlled trials provided esti-
mates for direct effects of each dietary factor on CHD, stroke, or type 2 diabetes, including
associations of F&V with CHD and stroke; whole grains with CHD, stroke, and type 2 diabe-
tes; nuts/seeds with CHD and diabetes; and polyunsaturated and seafood ω-3 fats with CHD
(S1 Appendix Table D). A declining proportional effect by age was incorporated, based on age
patterns of cardiometabolic risk factors and clinical events [9,11]. Because these observed etio-
logic effects assess how dietary differences relate to clinical risk in free-living populations, they
inherently incorporate the overall impact due to average dietary complements and substitutes
in the population. We have published detailed validity analyses evaluating the extent to which
these estimated etiologic effects of dietary factors may be biased by confounding or measure-
ment error [9,11]. These included comparing estimated etiologic effects for individual dietary
components to (1) observed associations of overall dietary patterns with clinical endpoints in
long-term cohorts, (2) effects of dietary patterns on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol
and systolic blood pressure in randomized controlled feeding trials, and (3) effects of dietary
patterns on clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) endpoints in a large controlled clinical trial
(S1 Appendix Text B; Tables E-G). Each of these analyses demonstrated that the estimated eti-
ologic effects from individual dietary components were very similar to what would be expected
based on these other lines of evidence.
Microsimulation model structure and outputs
CVD-PREDICT is a validated discrete time microsimulation model coded in C++ that is used
to simulate and quantify effects of policies on CHD, stroke, and diabetes, with annual updating
of each health state (S1 Appendix Text C) [41,42]. The model is run at the level of individuals,
which incorporates the probability of their health transition based on each person’s risk fac-
tors. Using data from NHANES 2009–2014, the model was populated with simulated individu-
als on Medicare and/or Medicaid including their risk factors such as age, sex, systolic blood
pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, and
current dietary habits. Other model variables included validated CHD and stroke risk equa-
tions and case fatality risks based on a calibrated Framingham-based risk function as well as
validated empiric historical disease trends [43]. CVD risk factors, the subsequent estimated
CVD incidence and mortality, and diabetes incidence were extrapolated and updated using
age and time trends from NHANES. At any given time point, a simulated individual could be
in one health state, with the probability of experiencing subsequent events based on individu-
al’s cardiometabolic risk factors and dietary habits. The microsimulation process across each
state and transitions is shown in Fig 1.

 Model outputs included total CVD events, CVD deaths, and diabetes cases at 5, 10, and 20
years and cohort lifetime. The specific model outcomes included deaths from CHD or stroke;
nonfatal events including myocardial infarction, stroke, angina, resuscitated cardiac arrest,
and diabetes incidence; quality-adjusted life years (QALYs); and event-associated health-
related costs. Outputs were estimated for overall Medicare and Medicaid population and fur-
ther by insurance group (Medicare, Medicaid, dual-eligible). To investigate consistency of
health and economic impacts of each program across subgroups within each insurance group,
analyses were further stratified by age (35–64, �65 years), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white,
non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, other), education (<high school, high school or some college,
college graduate or above), SNAP (SNAP participants, SNAP-eligible nonparticipants, SNAP-
ineligible individuals), and income (PIR < 1.3 or � 1.3) within Medicare; by race/ethnicity,
education, SNAP, and age (35–54, 55–74, �75 years) within Medicaid; and by race/ethnicity,
education, and SNAP within dual-eligible participants. Income strata are not shown within
Medicaid and dual-eligible because beneficiaries are of low income.
Policy and health-related costs
Policy costs included the administrative costs of program implementation and the subsidy costs
for incentivized foods (S1 Appendix Table H, Text D). Estimated administrative costs included
costs of personnel, training, use of the EBT system, and monitoring and evaluation, which were
derived from reports from SNAP [20] and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
[21]. Administrative costs were assumed to be higher (20% of total subsidy costs) in the first year
of implementation, based on SNAP administrative costs in 2004 when the EBT system was imple-
mented in all states [20], and lower (5% of total subsidy costs) in subsequent years, based on CMS
data demonstrating overall administrative costs of Medicaid to be about 5% of total expenditures
[21]. The costs of food incentives were calculated for each food category based on data from the
USDA Economic Research Service Quarterly Food-at-Home Price Database [22].
Fig 1. The CVD-PREDICT microsimulation model. Transitions were based on a calibrated risk score including age,
sex, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, current smoking, and diabetes status. Baseline risk
factors were derived from NHANES 2009–2014, with further annual changes in all risk factors incorporating both age
and secular trends. Increased intake of healthful foods could decrease the probability of transitioning of no CVD to
acute CVD and chronic CVD to recurring CVD or CVD death. Adapted from Mozaffarian D, et al (2018) Cost-

 Health-related costs included formal healthcare, informal healthcare, and productivity costs
(S1 Appendix Table I). Formal healthcare costs included for CVD all acute and chronic disease
states, surgical procedures, screening, treatments, and statin-associated side effects; for diabe-
tes, costs included institutional care, outpatient care, outpatient medications, and supplies.
Informal healthcare costs included costs for patients’ travel and waiting time as derived from
the Bureau of Labor Statistics [34]. Productivity costs were calculated using age-specific aver-
age annual earnings derived from the Current Population Survey [44].
Cost-effectiveness analysis
We followed recommendations from the Second Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medi-
cine [45]. Analyses were conducted from two perspectives: (1) healthcare perspective, incorporat-
ing policy costs and formal healthcare costs, and (2) societal perspective, further incorporating
informal healthcare and productivity costs. All costs were inflated to 2017 US dollars using the
Consumer Price Index [46], and all costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% annually. Net costs
were calculated as policy costs minus health-related cost savings. Incremental cost-effectiveness
ratios (ICERs) were calculated as the net change in costs divided by the net change in QALYs.
Willingness-to-pay thresholds were evaluated at $150,000 and $50,000 per QALY, as recom-
mended by the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association [47].
Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses
To assess the potential impact of uncertainty in key model inputs, probabilistic sensitivity anal-
yses incorporated the uncertainty distributions of multiple variables including policy effect
sizes, diet-disease relative risks (including their variation by age), food costs, formal healthcare
costs, and utility weights (S1 Appendix Table J). Drawing from the uncertainty distributions of
each of these inputs, 1,000 simulations were run at 5 years and over a lifetime, with 95% uncer-
tainty intervals based on the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the 1,000 simulations. One-way
sensitivity analyses were also evaluated to test the health and economic impacts of lower (20%)
and higher (50%) food subsidy levels for the two interventions.
Results
Baseline characteristics and dietary intakes
Medicare beneficiaries were more likely to be older and white and have higher incomes com-
pared with other insurance groups (S1 Appendix Table K). Adults on Medicaid were younger,
but other demographics were more similar to dual-eligible beneficiaries. Health characteristics
were generally similar across insurance groups. Baseline consumption of targeted healthful
foods was higher among individuals on Medicare compared with Medicaid or dual-eligible.
Compared to no new intervention, the F&V incentive would increase mean intakes of fruits
by 41.2 g/day (approximately 0.4 servings/day) and vegetables by 43.9 g/day (approximately
0.4 servings/day) (S1 Appendix Table L). The healthy food incentive would similarly increase
intakes of F&V and further increase mean intakes of whole grains by 8.1 g/day (approximately
0.2 servings/day), nuts/seeds by 3.8 g/day (approximately 0.1 servings/day), seafood by 4.8 g/
day (approximately 0.2 servings/day), and plant oils by 6.0 g/day (approximately 1.5 teaspoon)
in the overall combined population.
Health outcomes
Over a lifetime, the F&V incentive was estimated to prevent 1.93 million CVD events and 0.35
million CVD deaths and generate 4.64 million QALYs, compared with no new intervention

 (Table 2). Corresponding values for the healthy food incentive were 3.28 million CVD events
and 0.62 million CVD deaths prevented and 8.40 million QALYs gained. This scenario would
additionally prevent 0.12 million diabetes cases because of direct links of whole grains and nuts/
seeds with diabetes. Absolute health benefits were larger in Medicare because of a larger popula-
tion size (58.2 million) compared with Medicaid (35.2 million) and dual-eligible (11.4 million).
Projected reductions in total CVD events and diabetes cases and projected QALYs gained
increased with program duration for both incentive programs (Fig 2, S1 Appendix Fig B).
Cost-effectiveness
Lifetime policy costs for the F&V incentive and healthy food incentive would be $122.6 billion
and $210.4 billion, respectively. From a healthcare perspective, considering policy costs and
formal healthcare costs, the F&V incentive was estimated to save $39.7 billion in formal health-
care costs, with net costs of $83.5 billion over a lifetime; corresponding values for the healthy
food incentive were larger at $100.2 billion and $111.1 billion, respectively (Table 2). Both sce-
narios were cost-effective (<$150,000/QALY) at 5 years and highly cost-effective (<$50,000/
QALY) at 10 years and beyond, with lifetime ICERs of $18,184/QALY for the F&V incentive
and $13,194/QALY for the healthy food incentive (Fig 2, S1 Appendix Fig B). By insurance
group, ICERs for the healthy food incentive were substantially higher in Medicaid beneficiaries
in the short (5 years) ($135,093/QALY) and medium (10 years) term ($58,888/QALY) com-
pared with Medicare ($78,715/QALY, $34,721/QALY) and dual-eligible ($77,537/QALY,
$35,246/QALY). In contrast, lifetime ICERs were modestly higher in Medicare ($13,203/
QALY) compared with Medicaid ($11,453/QALY) and dual-eligible ($10,868/QALY) (Fig 2).
From a societal perspective, further including informal healthcare and productivity costs,
lifetime net costs were $68.8 billion for the F&V incentive and $80.5 billion for the healthy
food incentive (S1 Appendix Table M; Fig C). Lifetime ICERs were $14,576/QALY for the
F&V incentive and $9,497/QALY for the healthy food incentive. By insurance group, lifetime
ICERs were $10,078/QALY in Medicare, $5,916/QALY in Medicaid, and $5,842/QALY in
dual-eligible for the healthy food incentive.
Probability of cost-effectiveness
At 5 years, the probabilities that the F&V incentive would be cost-effective were 0.886, 0.909,
0.506, and 0.859 for overall, Medicare, Medicaid, and dual-eligible beneficiaries, respectively,
whereas for the healthy food incentive corresponding values were 0.997, 0.999, 0.667, and 0.98,
respectively (Fig 3, S1 Appendix Table N). Over a lifetime, the probability of both incentive
programs being cost-effective was 1.00 (1,000 of 1,000 simulations) for overall, Medicare, Med-
icaid, and dual-eligible beneficiaries.
Subgroup and one-way sensitivity analyses
Findings were generally robust according to beneficiary characteristics within each insurance
group, including by age, race, education, income, and SNAP status (Fig 4). From a healthcare
perspective, lifetime ICERs for all subgroups were well below $50,000/QALY. For the healthy
food incentive, within Medicare ICERs ranged from $9,303/QALY among college graduates to
$14,116/QALY among individuals of lower than high-school education; within Medicaid,
ICERs ranged from $7,176/QALY among whites to $23,802/QALY in college graduates; and
within dual-eligible, ICERs ranged from $3,582/QALY in SNAP-ineligible individuals to
$16,365/QALY in SNAP-eligible nonparticipants. Corresponding ICERs were modestly lower
from a societal perspective and modestly higher for the F&V incentive (S1 Appendix Table O).
Within Medicare, lifetime ICERs for both incentive programs were also highly cost-effective in

ment the healthy food incentive would be $162.3 billion, with net costs of $80.1 billion from a

tive, overall population ICER would be $11,201/QALY, and by insurance group ICER was
modestly higher for Medicare ($11,388/QALY) versus Medicaid ($9,239/QALY) and dual-eli-

projected changes in CVD events and deaths, diabetes cases, QALY gains, healthcare savings,
and net costs accordingly decreased or increased, but all subsidy levels were highly cost-effec-
tive (e.g., $9,870/QALY and $19,184/QALY for the 20% and 50% subsidy levels for the healthy

Discussion
Based on a validated microsimulation model incorporating nationally representative data, a
healthcare program incentivizing specific healthful foods would generate significant health
gains among adults on Medicare and Medicaid. Over a lifetime, a 30% F&V incentive was

 estimated to prevent 1.93 million CVD events and gain 4.64 million QALYs, whereas a broader
30% healthy food incentive was estimated to prevent 3.28 million CVD events and 0.12 million
diabetes cases and gain 8.40 million QALYs. Both scenarios were cost-effective at 5 years and
highly cost-effective at 10 and 20 years and over a lifetime. Incorporating additional savings
from productivity gains and informal healthcare costs, these programs would be even more
cost-effective with lifetime overall population ICERs of $14,576/QALY and $9,497/QALY,

 respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the health impacts, costs, and
cost-effectiveness of incentivizing diet through US health insurance programs.
Our findings were robust across different beneficiary groups, including for Medicare,
Medicaid, and dual-eligible beneficiaries. At 5 and 10 years, both incentive programs were
modestly more cost-effective within Medicare and dual-eligible compared with Medicaid pop-
ulations. For example, 5-year ICERs for the healthy food incentive from a societal perspective
were about $72,000–$75,000/QALY for Medicare and dual-eligible versus $126,000/QALY for
Medicaid. This is consistent with older ages of Medicare and dual-eligible enrollees (mostly
aged 65+ years) versus Medicaid adult enrollees (mean 54 years), resulting in larger absolute
reductions in cardiometabolic events and subsequent healthcare savings over a shorter time-
frame. In contrast, at 20 years and over a lifetime, the incentive programs were modestly more
cost-effective in Medicaid than Medicare, with lifetime ICERs of about $6,000/QALY for Med-
icaid versus $10,000/QALY for Medicare. This suggests that healthcare savings and productiv-
ity gains would be larger among younger adults over a longer timeframe. Nonetheless, these
incentives were cost-effective at 5 years for all the insurance groups and highly cost-effective at
20 years and beyond. Similarly, both incentive programs were highly cost-effective across sub-
groups within each insurance group at 20 years and beyond, including by age, race/ethnicity,
education, income, and SNAP status. For Medicare beneficiaries under 65 years of age, which
is about 16% of total Medicare enrollees [48] who may be particularly vulnerable because of
disability or other underlying factors [49], both programs remained highly cost-effective.
Our findings support the implementation of pilot and demonstration programs to test this
novel and promising approach in Medicare and Medicaid. For example, the Center for Medi-
care and Medicaid Innovation [50] could develop and test a pilot program to examine the fea-
sibility of incentivizing healthful foods through Medicare and Medicaid. In recent years, two
health-improving incentive programs have been proposed for Medicare and Medicaid benefi-
ciaries [6,7], both targeting traditional cardiometabolic risk factors such as body weight, diabe-
tes control, cholesterol, smoking, and blood pressure, with one of these now implemented in
for Medicaid beneficiaries 10 states [6]. Given that nearly half of all cardiometabolic deaths are
linked to poor diet [11], our findings suggest that incorporating incentives for healthier eating
into such programs could further improve the health of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.
The 2018 Farm Bill authorized up to $25 million for a new Produce Prescription Program to
test and evaluate interventions in healthcare using financial and other incentives to encourage
F&V consumption among patients. Our findings have direct implications for the design and
evaluation of interventions funded under this new Produce Prescription Program.
New public–private partnerships could also support economic incentives for healthy food
choices: for example, Wholesome Wave’s Fruit and Vegetable Prescription Program (FVRx)
operates through collaborations between Wholesome Wave, healthcare providers, and local
farm-to-retail businesses to provide $1 coupons for physician-written F&V prescriptions [12].
An evaluation of this program found significant increases in F&V consumption among partici-
pating patients, as well as reductions in BMI [51]. This year, the state of California launched a
$6 million pilot intervention in their Medicaid (Medical) program to cover medically tailored
meals [52], indicating interest and willingness by government insurance programs to incorpo-
rate and evaluate novel nutrition programs.
Average estimated subsidy costs for the F&V incentive and healthy food incentive programs
were about $110 and $185 per individual per year, respectively. From a healthcare perspective,
such approaches promoting healthy eating were estimated to be as or more cost-effective than
many currently covered medical interventions, such as drug treatment for hypertension
($20,000/QALY) [53], use of statins for primary prevention ($37,000/QALY) [42], or addition
of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor to statins in patients with

 CVD ($414,000/QALY) [54] or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia ($503,000/QALY)
[54]. Given that economic incentives through Medicare and Medicare are being considered to
promote health, our results highlight the need to prioritize diet as a key component to improve
outcomes within health insurance programs. The F&V incentive, healthy food incentive, and
modified healthy food incentive (excluding seafood and plant oils) programs were each cost-
effective, providing some flexibility in choosing between incentive strategies based on local
context. When we evaluated the impact of differential food subsidy levels, all subsidy levels
were cost-effective at 5 years and highly cost-effective after 20 years. A higher subsidy level
would prevent greater numbers of CVD and diabetes cases and gain more QALYs, suggesting
consideration of higher subsidy levels to maximize health benefits.
Our study has several strengths. We used a validated microsimulation model and nationally
representative data, which increases confidence in validity of our estimates. Because the esti-
mated changes in food consumption were based on proportional changes in individuals’ cur-
rent baseline intakes, this implicitly accounts—at least partly—for existing individual
characteristics and potential limitations for purchasing healthier foods from supermarkets and
grocery stores, for example, based on SNAP participation/eligibility or variations in physical
limitations, access, transport, etc. Etiologic effects of dietary changes were estimated from
meta-analyses with confirmatory validity analyses, including from randomized trials [11]. We
only evaluated proportions of foods purchased at stores that accept EBT cards (e.g., excluding
food from restaurants or cafeterias), providing a more appropriate and conservative estimate
of potential impact. We assessed both shorter- and longer-term health effects, costs, and cost-
effectiveness, providing a range of results across different potential time periods of interest, as
well from both healthcare and societal perspectives.
Potential limitations should be considered. Our model cannot prove the health and cost
effects of these food incentive programs through Medicare and Medicaid. Rather, the estimates
provide evidence that can be considered and incorporated into the design and evaluation of
incentive programs at federal (for Medicare and Medicaid) and state (for Medicaid) levels. Eti-
ologic effects of each dietary factor were derived from meta-analyses of prospective observa-
tional studies [9,11], which may be overestimated because of residual confounding or
underestimated because of measurement error and regression dilution bias. Yet, magnitudes
of these estimated etiologic effects are supported by validity analyses of predicted effects based
on evidence from randomized controlled feeding studies of CVD risk factors as well as a large
randomized clinical trial (i.e., the PREDIMED trial) [11]. We did not model improved health
outcomes or cost savings from reductions in other diseases that may be influenced by healthier
eating (e.g., cancer, other obesity-mediated conditions), which may underestimate observed
benefits. Our investigation did not evaluate political or legal feasibility, which could be consid-
ered in future research.
In conclusion, our findings suggest that incentive programs for healthier eating among
adults on Medicare and Medicaid could generate substantial health gains and be cost-effective
overall and by insurance group. These results have implications for ongoing policy discussions
at the federal and state level, as well as for the new federal Produce Prescription Program, for
novel approaches to improve health outcomes and reduce healthcare costs through existing
health insurance programs.
