Abstract
The activation of resident microglial cells, alongside the infiltration of peripheral macrophages, are 
key neuroinflammatory responses to traumatic brain injury (TBI) that are directly associated with 
neuronal death. Sexual disparities in response to TBI have been previously reported, however it is 
unclear whether a sex difference exists in neuroinflammatory progression after TBI. We exposed 
male and female mice to moderate-to-severe controlled cortical impact injury and studied glial cell 
activation in the acute and chronic stages of TBI using immunofluorescence and in situ 
hybridization analysis. We found that the sex response was completely divergent up to 7 days post-
injury. TBI caused a rapid and pronounced cortical microglia/macrophage activation in male mice 
with a prominent activated phenotype that produced both pro- (IL-1β and TNFα) and anti-
inflammatory (Arg1 and TGFβ) cytokines with a single-phase, sustained peak from 1 to 7 days. In 
contrast, TBI caused a less robust microglia/macrophage phenotype in females with biphasic pro-
inflammatory response peaks at 4 hours and 7 days, and a delayed anti-inflammatory mRNA peak 
at 30 days. We further report that female mice were protected against acute cell loss after TBI, 
with male mice demonstrating enhanced astrogliosis, neuronal death, and increased lesion volume 
through 7 days post-TBI. Collectively, these findings indicate that TBI leads to a more aggressive 
neuroinflammatory profile in male compared to female mice during the acute and sub-acute 
phases post-injury. Understanding how sex affects the course of neuroinflammation following 
brain injury is a vital step toward developing personalized and effective treatments for TBI.

 associated with neuronal death (Corps et al. 2015). This neuroinflammation begins in the 
acute phase but can last for years post-injury in both humans and animals (Johnson et al. 
2013; Kumar et al. 2013; Rice et al. 2017; Smith et al. 2013). Microglial/macrophages (MG/
Mϕ) are the main players in propagating inflammation to tissues neighboring the core site of 
injury. They perform this task through the production of inflammatory mediators including 
cytokines and chemokines. The activation of MG/Mϕ can be observed experimentally by 
examining time specific changes in morphology, and the production profiles of pro- and 
anti-inflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide, prostaglandins, or chemokines (Harry and Kraft 
2008; Kettenmann et al. 2011; Ransohoff and Perry 2009).
Microglia are resident immune cells in the brain that are activated in response to injury 
(Saijo and Glass 2011). CNS injury also induces macrophage recruitment from the 
periphery, whose role is to rapidly access the injury site as a first line of defense against 
infection (Corps et al. 2015; Mishra et al. 2016). Comprehensively differentiating these two 
cell populations is difficult, but they do differ in their morphological and phenotypical 
classification. Typically, activated microglial cells appear hypertrophic/bushy with robust 
prolongations, while peripheral macrophages display an amoeboid morphology containing 
numerous vacuoles (Kettenmann et al. 2011). Depending on the grade of activation after 
brain injury, the MG/Mϕ population can exhibit different functions and distinct metabolic 
stages. Studies have shown a “pro-inflammatory” MG/Mϕ phenotype associated with the 
production of cytokines such as interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor alpha 
(TNFα), interferon gamma (IFNγ), and cluster of differentiation 40 (CD40) receptors; an 
“alternative activation” phenotype associated to the production of Arginase-1 (Arg1), 
interleukins 4 and 13 (IL-4, IL-13); and a “deactivated” phenotype associated with 
interleukin 10 (IL-10) or transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ) which facilitate wound 
healing (Hsieh et al. 2013; Jin et al. 2012; Kumar et al. 2016a; Kumar et al. 2016b; Martinez 
and Gordon 2014; Tang and Le 2016). While a coordinated transition from a pro-
inflammatory phenotype to an alternative or deactivated phenotype is hypothesized to 
facilitate the transition from acute brain injury response to neuron repair, emerging studies 
suggest that the switch between these stages has not been adequately established, and that 
cytokines classically defined as pro-inflammatory can also have anti-inflammatory 
properties, and vice versa (Durafourt et al. 2012; Martinez and Gordon 2014; Orihuela et al. 
2016; Selenica et al. 2013; Tang and Le 2016). Indeed, following experimental TBI there is 
an overlapping expression of phenotypic markers in MG/Mϕ (Kim et al. 2016; Kumar et al. 
2016a; Morganti et al. 2016).
A recent review highlights the sparse and controversial background literature on sex-
differences in mortality and functional outcome after TBI (Caplan et al. 2017), and it is clear 
that more studies are required to understand how sex affects neuroinflammatory mechanisms 
and outcomes after injury. However, the vast majority of the experimental preclinical TBI 
studies looking at the inflammatory response to TBI have been conducted using male 
animals. While it is known that females respond different to brain injury due to hormonal 
changes, the specific mechanisms underlying these sex differences remains elusive. Due to 
these challenges, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are encouraging sexual diversity in 
pre-clinical research (McCullough et al. 2014). As far we are aware, this is the first study 
demonstrating the temporal and spatial differences in MG/Mϕ activation following TBI, with

 a focus on morphological changes and cytokine mRNA production. Here, we report that the 
male/female MG/Mϕ response shows complete divergence in the sub-acute phase post-
injury with male mice displaying faster and more pronounced MG/Mϕ activation and 
astrogliosis following moderate-to-severe TBI compared to female mice. In situ 
hybridization also reveals a divergent cytokine mRNA profile in MG/Mϕ cells after injury. 
This is associated with early neuronal cell death and larger lesion volume in the first days 
post-injury in male compared to female mice. Our data suggest that pharmacological 
interventions that target the inflammatory cascade should consider sex differences as a 
significant variable following TBI.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals and Controlled Cortical impact injury
We used young adult (9–14 weeks) male and female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories, 
Bar Harbor, ME), housed under standard 12h light:dark cycle, 5 mice per cage, with open 
access to food and water. We used random cycling of female mice to better reflect clinical 
applicability. We housed 5 females per cage, isolated from male mice. To neutralize weight 
as a variable, we matched male and female mice for each group by weight. The average 
body weight at the time of the injury was 20.84 ± 0.33 g for males and 20.28 ± 0.20 g for 
females. Mice were also weighed at time of euthanasia, and there were no significant 
differences between males or females at all time-points (data not shown).
Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (induction at 3% and maintained at 1.5%) 
evaporated in oxygen and administered through a nose mask. The mice were placed on a 
custom-made stereotaxic frame with a built-in heating bed that maintains body temperature 
at 37°C. A 10-mm midline incision was made over the skull to allow a 4 mm craniotomy on 
the left parietal bone. We performed moderate-to-severe controlled cortical impact (CCI) 
injury in the right somatosensory cortex target area (interaural 2 mm and bregma 2 mm) 
using a Leica Impact One Stereotaxic Impactor device (Leica Biosystems) to deliver the 
cortical impact, with a 3 mm diameter flat impact tip, impact velocity of 5.25 m/sec, impact 
depth of 1.5 mm, and dwell time of 0.1 sec. After injury, the incision was closed with staples 
and the mice were allowed to recover fully from anesthesia before transferring to their home 
cages. Sham injury consisted of exposure to anesthesia; stereotaxic mounting, skin and 
fascia reflection and incision closed using staples. All procedures were performed in 
accordance with protocols approved by the Georgetown University Animal Care and Use 
Committee. Mice were euthanized with CO2 and transcardially perfused with phosphate 
buffer and decapitated at 4 hours (h), 1, 3, 7 and 30 days post-injury (dpi). After post-
fixation of the brains in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, brains were stored in a 30% 
sucrose solution for 48 h at 4°C. A sliding microtome (Microm HM 430, Thermo Fisher 
Scientific, Tusin, CA) was used to section the brains at 20 μm-thick in coronal orientation. 
The brain sections were then cryoprotected in an antifreeze solution (30% glycerol + 30% 
ethylene glycol + 40% 0.01 M PBS) for storage at − 20°C.

 Immunohistochemical techniques
Free-floating parallel sections were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline 
(PBS), before staining and incubated with blocking buffer (5% normal goat serum in PBS) 
and 0.3% Triton X-100 (PBST) for 2 h at room temperature. For the histological analysis of 
glial activation, brain sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with either one of the 
following primary antibodies: 1) rabbit polyclonal anti-Iba-1 antibody (1:500, Wako, 
Chemicals, Richmond, VA) for microglia/macrophages cells and 2) mouse monoclonal anti-
GFAP antibody (1:1000, Millipore, Temecula, CA) for astrocytes. After three 5 min washes 
in PBS, sections were incubated with a corresponding anti-rabbit or anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 
568-conjugated IgG secondary antibodies (1:1000, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 2 h at room 
temperature. For double labeling, sections were processed with polyclonal anti-rabbit P2Y12 
(1:1000, Anaspec, San Jose, CA) and polyclonal anti-rat F4/80 (1:200, R&D Systems, 
Minneapolis, MN) overnight at 4°C. As negative controls, sections were incubated in media 
lacking the primary antibody. After three 5 min washes in PBS, sections were incubated with 
a corresponding anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated IgG and anti-rat Alexa Fluor 488-
conjugated IgG secondary antibodies (1:1000, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 2 h at room 
temperature. Sections were rinsed with PBS three times and incubated in PBS with DAPI 
solution (1:50,000) for counterstained nuclei. The sections were rinsed with distilled water 
and coverslipped with Fluoro-Gel with Tris Buffer mounting medium (Electron Microscopy 
Sciences, Hatfield, PA).
Densitometry and quantitative analysis of immunohistochemistry
For quantitative analysis of immunolabeled sections, we implemented unbiased standardized 
sampling techniques to measure tissue areas corresponding to the cortex, hippocampal 
dentate gyrus, and thalamus showing positive immunoreactivity (Villapol et al. 2015; 
Villapol et al. 2014) (Fig. 1). To quantify the number of Iba-1 positive cells, an average of 
five single plane sections from the lesion epicenter (−1.34 to − 2.30 mm from bregma) were 
analyzed blind for each animal for each brain region. Within each brain region, every Iba-1-
positve cell in each of 5 (cortex), 2 (dentate gyrus) or 3 (dentate gyrus and thalamus) fields 
(x20, 151.894 mm2) around the impact area (n=5–6 mice/group at each time-point) (Fig. 
1B). Data is presented as the mean number of cells per mm2. For proportional area 
measurements, the magnitude of the individual reaction for microglial and astroglial cells 
was reported as the proportional area of tissue occupied by immunohistochemical stained 
cellular profiles within a defined target area. Proportional area measurements do not 
necessarily reflect changes in actual cell numbers. Fluorescent images were acquired on a 
Axioplan 2 microscope (Zeiss, Thorwood, NY) with a Photometrics camera. Images were 
transferred to ImageJ64 software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA), for 
inversion and thresholding, and densitometric analysis was performed as previously 
described (Villapol et al. 2015; Villapol et al. 2014). The thresholding function is used to set 
a black and white threshold corresponding to the imaged field, with the averaged 
background subtracted out. Once a threshold is set, the “Analyze Particles” function can be 
used to sum up the total area of positive staining, and to calculate the fraction of the total 
area that is positive for the stain as previously was described (Villapol et al. 2015; Villapol et 
al. 2014). Data are shown as the percentage of Iba-1 or GFAP positive immunoreactivity per 
the total area that occupied on the field studied.

 Microglia and astrocyte morphologic assessment
Under physiological conditions, microglia exist in the “surveying” stage. In response to TBI, 
ramified microglia transform into activated non-phagocytic cells commonly referred to as 
“activated” microglia (Nimmerjahn et al. 2005). To characterize the morphology of Iba-1 
positive cells, we counted and classified the number of cortical microglial cells in each of 
the five MG/Mϕ morphologic phenotypes (Ayoub and Salm 2003; Doyle et al. 2017; Glenn 
et al. 1992; Kettenmann et al. 2011) in sham brains and injured brains at 4 h, 1, 3, 7 and 30 
days after TBI. Morphological classification was based on a visual assessment of the MG/
Mϕ population. We used the following classifications 1) ramified (small cell body and long 
finely branched processes that extend in all directions from the perinuclear cytoplasm); 2) 
ramified with rough prolongations (first stage of microglia activation, phagocytic abilities); 
3) hypertrophy/bushy microglia with pseudopodia (activated microglia demonstrate modest 
hypertrophy, and have limited, cytoplasmic extensions); 4) amoeboid with phagocytosed 
cells (macrophages or phagocytic microglia with fully retracted processes and clearly 
evident phagocytized debris); 5) amoeboid round (macrophages or microglial-derived brain 
macrophages round in shape). An investigator that was blinded to the identity of the 
experimental groups performed morphometric analysis (n=5–6 mice/group at each time-
point).
Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization combined with immunohistochemical labeling for 
microglia/macrophages population
Coronal brain sections were mounted on gelatin-coated glass slides (Superfrost Plus, 
Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stored at − 80°C until use. Fluorescent in situ hybridization 
(FISH) was performed as per the manufacturer’s instructions using RNAscope® Technology 
2.0 Red Fluorescent kit for Fresh Frozen Tissue (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Inc. (ACD), 
Hayward, CA). All target probes consisted of 20 short double-Z oligonucleotide probe pairs 
that are gene specific and were obtained from ACD. For amplification and visualization, 
both Z-probes must bind to the mRNA of interest. Following probe hybridization, sections 
underwent a series of probe signal amplification steps followed by incubation of 
fluorescently labeled probes designed to target the Red channel associated (Fig. 1H). Brain 
tissue sections were dehydrated by 50%, 70%, and 100% ethanol gradually for 5 min; boiled 
during 10 min with pretreatment 2 solution (citrate buffer), then they were incubated with 
pretreatment 3 solution (protease buffer) for 30 min before hybridization. Sections were then 
incubated at 40°C for 2 h with the following target probes for mouse: Mus musculus 
interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) mRNA, (accession number NM_008361.3, target region 2–950); 
Mus musculus Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) mRNA, (accession number 
NM_013693.2, target region 41–1587); Mus musculus transforming growth factor, beta 1 
(TGFβ1) mRNA, (accession number NM_011577.1, target region 588–1913); Mus 
musculus arginase (Arg1) mRNA, (accession number NM_007482.3, target region 2–1114). 
A dapB probe targeting a bacterial gene was used as a negative control and Ppib (Mus 
musculus peptidylprolyl isomerase B mRNA; accession number NM_011149.2, target 
region 98–856) was used as a positive control. Positive hybridization consisted of a punctate 
signal representing a single mRNA target molecule, the color label was assigned to either 
FAR RED (Excitation 647 nm; Emission 690 ± 10 nm). After FISH, slides were washed 
three times with PBS and blocking with PBST and 5% normal goat serum for 1 h.

 Immunofluorescence was performed using a mixture of primary antibodies to visualize the 
total MG/Mϕ population; polyclonal anti-rabbit Iba-1 (1:500), polyclonal anti-rabbit P2Y12 
(1:1000) and polyclonal anti-rat F4/80 (1:200) overnight at 4°C. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated 
goat anti-rabbit, and anti-rat IgG (1:1000, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were applied for 1 h at 
room temperature. Sections were rinsed with PBS three times and incubated in PBS with 
DAPI solution (1:50,000) for counterstained nuclei. The sections were washed three times 
with distilled water and coverslipped with Fluoro-Gel with Tris Buffer mounting medium 
(Electron Microscopy Sciences).
Quantification of immunofluorescence and FISH
Investigators blinded to the experimental conditions quantified FISH signal in three fields 
(x10, 514.560 mm2) within the primary somatosensory cortex of 4 non-contiguous slices of 
the ipsilateral cortex (or cortical layer III–IV for sham mice) in a range of bregma −1.34 to 
−2.30 mm (Fig. 1A). The number of mRNA-positive cells that colocalized with DAPI nuclei 
were manually counted for IL-1β, TNFα, TGFβ, and Arg1. The negative probe used as a 
control did not contain any stained cells. The number of mRNA-positive/MG/Mϕ-positive 
cells, mRNA-positive/MG/Mϕ-negative cells, and the total number of MG/Mϕ cells were 
also quantified in four to six microscopic fields (x20, 151.894 mm2) of view. A total of 15–
20 counting frames were assessed per animal, and cells were evaluated for the presence of a 
labeled nucleus and expected cellular morphology as was previously described (Villapol et 
al. 2013). In addition, the percentage of MG/Mϕ immunoreactive cells with different mRNA 
probes was also assessed (n=5–6 mice/group at each time-point). The images were analyzed 
using AxionVision software and quantified using ImageJ64 software. Images were cropped 
and resized (if necessary) using Adobe Photoshop CS5, any changes to brightness and 
contrast settings were applied equally to the entire image, and to all corresponding images 
within the same dataset. A confocal microscope (Leica SP8) was used to take representative 
images from FISH-ISH brain sections using ×20, ×40 and ×63 objectives.
Cell Death Assay
Brain sections were processed for Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated 
biotinylated-dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed by using the In situ 
Cell Death Detection kit, Fluorescein (Roche, IL), according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. Coronal brain sections were mounted on gelatin-coated glass slides (Superfrost 
Plus). Briefly, cryosections were rinsed with PBS and were incubated with kit-supplied 
TUNEL reaction mixture at 37°C for 1 h. For double-staining, cryosections were incubated 
with primary antibody against anti-Neurofilament 200 (NF200) (1:200, Abcam) overnight at 
4°C, Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:1000, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) 
were applied for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were rinsed with PBS three times and 
incubated in PBS with DAPI solution for counterstained nuclei. The sections were washed 
three times with distilled water and coverslipped with Fluoro-Gel with Tris Buffer mounting 
medium (Electron Microscopy Sciences). TUNEL-positive nuclei were counted in cortical 
regions (×20) in the three to five coronal sections for each animal (n=5–6 mice/group at each 
time-point).

 Histological Nissl stain and lesion volume measurements
Nissl staining was assessed on an average of 13 brain sections spaced equidistant apart, 
between 0 to − 2.70 mm from bregma corresponding to the injured area. Brain slices were 
mounted on gelatin-coated glass slides (Superfrost Plus) and stained for 5 min with 1% 
Cresyl-violet (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) dissolved in distilled water and filtered. Slides 
stained were dehydrated for 2 min using 100, 95, 70 and 50% ethanol, cleared in xylene for 
2 min, covered with Permount mounting medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 
coverslipped. The lesion volume was calculated by subtracting the ipsilateral hemisphere 
area from the contralateral hemisphere area, and multiplying by the distance between 
sections. Lesion percentage was calculated by dividing the ipsilateral hemisphere by the 
contralateral hemisphere (Villapol et al. 2012).
Statistical analyses
Data were analyzed using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni post-hoc 
test using GraphPad Prism software v. 5.0 (Graphpad). A p-value < 0.05 was considered 
statistically significant. Quantitative data for all figures and tables are expressed as mean ± 
S.E.M.
RESULTS
Sex dimorphism in MG/Mϕ activation after TBI
Previous reports have consistently demonstrated a role for microglial activation in the 
pathophysiology of TBI, however, the impact of sex differences on this response is 
unknown. Using immunohistochemistry, we detected Iba-1 positive cells and determined 
their number, area occupied and morphology in several injured brain regions of adult male 
and female mice at several time-points after TBI. We report that the total Iba-1-positive area 
was significantly higher in male mice in the primary somatosensory cortex (306.2 and 
172.90% increase in male vs. female mice at 1 and 3 dpi respectively; p < 0.001; Fig. 2A–
C), in the dentate gyrus (240.4, 225.3 and 129.8% increase in male vs. female mice at 1, 3 
and 7 dpi respectively; p < 0.001; Fig. 2D–F), and in the thalamus (158.4 and 149.4% 
increase in male vs. female mice at 1 and 3 dpi respectively; p < 0.05; Fig. 2G–I). For 
quantitative analysis, we focused on the primary somatosensory cortex region, located 
immediately adjacent to the injury site (Fig. 1B). We found that TBI in male mice caused a 
rapid increase in the number of Iba-1 cells beginning at 1 dpi, but female mice did not 
increase Iba-1 cells until 7 dpi – suggesting decreased MG/Mϕ infiltration/proliferation at 
the acute phase post-trauma (Fig. 2J). Male and female mice had a similar number of MG/
Mϕ cells at 30 dpi in all brain regions. Next, we determined the morphological status of the 
MG/Mϕ into a) ramified, b) ramified with thick, rough prolongations, c) hypertrophic/bushy 
with pseudopodia, d) amoeboid with phagocytosed cells, or d) amoeboid round cells (Fig. 
2K–O). Following sham-injury, 100% of the MG/Mϕ were classified as ramified, displaying 
small cell bodies with thin, long, and highly branched processes. In both sexes, TBI caused a 
time-dependent change in MG/Mϕ morphology with the number of ramified microglia in the 
primary somatosensory cortex being completely abolished by 3 dpi (Fig. 2K). Female mice 
had higher numbers of ramified MG/Mϕ with thick rough prolongations at 4 h and 1 dpi (p < 
0.01; Fig. 2L). At 1 and 3 dpi, male mice had significantly higher numbers of hypertrophy/

 bushy MG/Mϕ with pseudopodia (p < 0.001; Fig. 2M), and significantly higher amoeboid 
MG/Mϕ with phagocytosed cells at 7 dpi (p < 0.05; Fig. 2N), and significantly higher 
amoeboid round MG/Mϕ (p < 0.01; Fig. 2O).
Rapid activation and infiltration of MG/Mϕ to the injured cortex occurs in male, but not 
female mice
TBI induces the rapid infiltration of blood-derived peripheral immune cells into the brain. 
We used a combination of membrane-specific markers and morphological changes to 
determine if the Iba-1-labeled cells with large phagocytic vacuoles/vesicles could be 
infiltrating cells. F4/80 is a well-characterized membrane protein highly expressed on 
macrophages, and F4/80-positive macrophages have been shown to rapidly infiltrate the 
injured cortex following TBI (Hsieh et al. 2013; Kumar et al. 2016a; Morganti et al. 2015). 
To discern the total MG/Mϕ population, we also used the P2Y12 maker, a known membrane 
marker that distinguishes microglia from other myeloid lineage cells; its expression is 
limited to the ramified processes of microglia (Moore et al. 2015), however, P2Y12 was also 
identified in activated microglia (Ohsawa et al. 2010; Ohsawa and Kohsaka 2011). Sham-
injured male and female brains both had P2Y12-positive microglia, with no evidence of 
F4/80-positive cells in the somatosensory cortex (Fig. 3A–A2, B–B2, K). Within 4 h post-
injury, F4/80 positive macrophages remained rare (Fig. 3C–D) in the injured cortex; 
however, changes in the morphology of P2Y12 cells were evident (Fig. 3C–C2, D–D2, K). 
Male mice displayed a significant increase in F4/80-positive cells at 1 and 3 dpi that did not 
occur in female mice (p < 0.01; Fig. 3E–H, K). Infiltrating macrophages were evident in 
female mice at 7 dpi and were not significantly different to F4/80 cell number in male mice 
at this time-point (Fig. 3I–J, K). By 30 dpi there were no F4/80 cells in either male or female 
mice (data not shown). We also performed immunofluorescence to detect CD68, a marker of 
highly activated and phagocytic myeloid cells that include both microglia and macrophages 
(Fig. 3L–N). We again found that male mice had significantly higher numbers of CD68-
positive cells at 1, 3 and 7 dpi (p < 0.001; Fig. 3L) compared females (Fig. 3L–N).
Sex differences in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression after TBI
RNAscope FISH in combination with immunofluorescence was performed on brain sections 
collected from male and female mice. Females had significantly higher levels of IL-1β 
cytokines at 4 h post-TBI, compared to males (Fig. 4A), suggesting that the IL-1β 
expression in response to injury within the male and female brain may be functionally, or 
biochemically, distinct. There was no detectable IL-1β expression in sham animals, while 
approximately 50% of cells expressing IL-1β were detected in MG/Mϕ (see plots in Fig. 
4B). Collectively, these data show that IL-1β mRNA expression within the male and female 
brains is not only produced by the MG/Mϕ population, but also by other glial cell types or 
neurons (Choi and Friedman 2009; Srinivasan et al. 2004). Additionally, mRNA IL-1β 
expression intensity was sex-specific in IL-1β positive cells, within high levels in MG/Mϕ of 
females at 4 h compared to males, and an inverse mRNA IL-1β MG/Mϕ expression profile 
at 1 and 3 dpi (Fig. 4C). In accordance with this data, females had increased mRNA TNFα 
expression compared to males at 4 h post-TBI, whereas males had significantly increased 
mRNA TNFα expression at 3 dpi compared to females (Fig. 4L). There was no detectable 
TNFα expression in sham-operated animals. Approximately 70% of TNFα positive cells

 colocalized with MG/Mϕ (see plots in Fig. 4M). Additionally, we determined the collective 
intensity levels of mRNA TNFα expression showed no sex discrepancies. MG/Mϕ 
localization and TNFα positive cell distribution in the ipsilateral cortex cells in males and 
females is shown in Fig. 4(O, P, S, T, t1–t3) and (Q, R, U, V, v1–v3), respectively. By 7 dpi, 
male and female TBI mice had similar expression profiles of both pro-inflammatory IL-1β 
and TNFα mRNAs (Fig. 4A, L).
Anti-inflammatory cytokines are predominantly expressed in males after brain injury
The expression profiles of TGFβ, a marker of immunoregulatory cells, and Arg1, a marker 
of alternatively activated cells, were analyzed in the cortex of males and female mice. 
Following TBI we observed an increase in the production of TGFβ in males, but not in 
females, at 1 dpi compared to sham mice. Peak expression of TGFβ was observed at 7 dpi, 
but no sex-dependent differences were observed (Fig. 5A). Approximately 80% of TGFβ 
positive cells colocalized with MG/Mϕ (Fig. 5M). These results demonstrated that a high 
percentage of MG/Mϕ cells express TGFβ and that the remainder of cells correspond to 
astrocytes and/or vessels (data not shown). Furthermore, TGFβ expression levels 
demonstrate a strong correlation in the pattern of TGFβ expression per mm2 in both male 
and female animals. An increase in the Arg1 levels was found only in the ipsilateral cortex 
of male mice at 3 dpi, continuing up to 7 dpi. Female mice did not show similarly robust 
increased expression levels (Fig. 5L). In addition, the observed sex difference was not found 
in sham-injured mice. Approximately 70–90% of Arg1 positive cells were detected in MG/
Mϕ, across all time-points (Fig. 5M). With respect to Arg1 expression, mRNA Arg1 was 
predominantly produced by MG/Mϕ cells that displayed an amoeboid morphology (Fig. 
5t1–t3). Furthermore, mRNA Arg1 expression levels were significantly higher in male 
compared to female mice at 3 and 7 dpi (p < 0.001; Fig. 5N), respectively.
Cell death is time and sex dependent following TBI
We examined TBI-induced neuronal cell death in the pericontusional cortex, adjacent to the 
impact. At 4 h after injury, we observed 38% more TUNEL positive cells in female 
compared with male mice (p < 0.001; Fig. 6A). There were no sex-dependent differences in 
TUNEL cell number at 1 dpi, however, at 3 dpi, there was a 358% increase in TUNEL 
positive neurons in males compared to females in the pericontusional cortical regions (p < 
0.05; Fig. 6A–C). This translated into significantly larger infarct area in male mice 
compared to female mice at 3 dpi (Fig. 6D, E). Overall, lesion was 64% larger in male mice 
at 3 dpi (P < 0.001) and 36% larger at 7 dpi (P < 0.01) compared to female mice (Fig. 6F, 
G). Lesion volume at 30 dpi was similar between male and female mice (Fig. 6F, G).
Acute astrogliosis occurs in male, but not female, mice after TBI
We used GFAP immunohistochemistry to assess the temporal and spatial distribution of 
astrogliosis in males and female brains following TBI. We found that the immunoreactive 
area occupied by GFAP positive astrocytes was higher in males compared to females at 1 
and 7 dpi in the ipsilateral cortex (833 and 196% respectively) (Fig. 7A–C), at 1 and 3 dpi in 
the ipsilateral hippocampal dentate gyrus (560 and 163% respectively) (Fig. 7D–F), and in 
the ipsilateral thalamus at 1, 3 and 7 dpi (297, 629 and 140% respectively) (Fig. 7G–I). For

 all areas studied, astrogliosis was not significantly different between male and female mice 
at 30 dpi.
DISCUSSION
There are limited studies on the effect of sex on inflammation after CNS injury, and in this 
study, we examine the spatial and time-dependent neuroinflammatory changes that occur 
after experimental TBI. We report that after brain injury, male mice have a faster and more 
robust MG/Mϕ activation and peripheral macrophage recruitment compared to females (Fig. 
8). This leads to increased cell death and lesion volume in the first week post-injury. 
However, beyond the first week post-injury, the female inflammatory response accelerates to 
become indistinguishable from that of males. While we can detect sex-differences in lesion 
volume acutely after injury, we observe identical brain tissue loss at 1-month post-injury. 
Previous clinical and animal studies have demonstrated that sex-differences in mortality and 
functional outcomes exist after TBI (Caplan et al. 2017), and the use of hormone-based 
therapies in preclinical studies clearly show that female sex hormones, estrogen, and 
progesterone, are protective after TBI (Engler-Chiurazzi et al. 2016; Stein 2015). One of the 
major targets of estrogen and progesterone is the inflammatory response, and in vitro and in 
vivo studies demonstrate that these hormones can attenuate microglial activation and pro-
inflammatory cytokine release (Arevalo et al. 2013; Belcredito et al. 2001; Bruce-Keller et 
al. 2007; Bruce-Keller et al. 2000; Crain et al. 2013; Dimayuga et al. 2005; Goodman et al. 
1996; Habib and Beyer 2015; Sawada et al. 2000; Vegeto et al. 2001). Here we studied how 
sex altered the inflammatory response following moderate-to-severe TBI with a focus on 
MG/Mϕ number, morphology, and cytokine mRNA profile.
Microglia are dynamic immune cells whose number and morphological changes are closely 
associated with their functional activity (Ohsawa and Kohsaka 2011; Stence et al. 2001; Tam 
and Ma 2014). We found that TBI caused a rapid increase in the total number of Iba-1 
immunopositive cells in male mice that was significantly faster than the response in female 
mice. These cells were also much larger on average, with male Iba-1 immunopositive cells 
having a larger area than female cells through 7 dpi. These data are in agreement with 
previous results studying stab injury, where an injury induced a greater density of Iba-1 cells 
in the lesion border in male mice at 7d post-TBI compared to female mice (Acaz-Fonseca et 
al. 2015).
Morphologically, microglia in the un-injured brain have numerous, thin, ramified processes 
that survey the local tissue microenvironment, and following acute CNS insult microglia 
rapidly transform into an activated phenotype with distinct hypertrophic or bushy 
morphologies (Faden et al. 2016; Jin et al. 2012; Schnell et al. 1999). We observed sexual 
dimorphism in the morphological changes that occurred after TBI, with hypertrophic/
amoeboid/phagocytic MG/Mϕ being more predominant in males compared to females. 
Morphological changes in MG/Mϕ phenotypes could be a determinant factor in activation of 
the inflammatory cascade, involving the expression of a broad range of surface receptors that 
allows them to sense subtle changes in the microenvironment and help to identify the degree 
of activation (Castellano et al. 2016; Hsieh et al. 2013; Perego et al. 2011). We used a CD68 
marker to identify activated MG/Mϕ, with a preference for phagocytic cells (Perego et al. 
Villapol et al.

 2011). We found a significant elevation in CD68 cells by 1 dpi in male mice, which 
continued to increase through 7 dpi. In female mice we did not see significant increases in 
CD68 positive cells until 7 dpi, again demonstrating that female MG/Mϕ have a blunted 
response to TBI compared to male MG/Mϕ.
P2Y12 has been identified as a receptor that distinguishes CNS-resident ramified microglia 
from other blood-derived myeloid lineage cells (Butovsky et al. 2014; Kumar et al. 2016b; 
Moore et al. 2015), and loss of P2Y12 expression in microglia results in a decreased number 
of processes and cell migration following focal injury (Haynes et al. 2006). We found a 
dense population of microglial cells expressing P2Y12 marker in sham brains that remained 
after injury in both sexes. P2Y12 expression in microglial cells has been reported to 
diminish as the microglial cells become fully ramified (Haynes et al. 2006), however, we 
clearly observed ramified and activated P2Y12-positive microglial cells up to 7 dpi in both 
male and female mice. Previous reports also demonstrate that P2Y12 is preferentially 
expressed in CD68+/CD163+ (anti-inflammatory) MG/Mϕ during parasitic brain infection 
(Moore et al. 2015), however in our study we did not observe any evidence that P2Y12 
positive cells were better associated with specific cytokines after brain injury.
Rapid infiltration of peripheral cells plays a critical role in mediating sex differences in the 
brain response to experimental stroke, with splenectomy prior to ischemia eliminating the 
sex differences in infarct volume and activated brain MG/Mϕ in mice (Dotson et al. 2015). 
Similarly, TBI also triggers infiltration of circulating blood cells (Hsieh et al. 2013; Jin et al. 
2012), and we used the presence of the F4/80 protein as an indicator of macrophage 
recruitment to the CNS, as has been previously described (Hsieh et al. 2013; Kumar et al. 
2016b; Morganti et al. 2014). We observed that male mice had a high expression of F4/80 
positive cells by 1 dpi that were highly concentrated at the lesion border. Female TBI brain 
had very low levels of F4/80 positive MG/Mϕ until 7 dpi when these cells became apparent 
around the lesion border. Very few F4/80-positive cells overlapped with P2Y12-positive cells 
in mouse brain after injury indicating distinct populations. Our data is in agreement with 
findings from the ischemia field where male mice have more peripheral leukocytes 3 days 
after hypoxia-ischemia compared to females (Mirza et al. 2015), causing increased 
secondary neuronal damage. Together these data suggest that female mice have reduced 
peripheral inflammatory cell infiltration to the injured CNS, which appears to protect against 
acute neuronal injury.
Morphological changes have been associated with the grade of activation and production of 
specific cytokines (Cao et al. 2012; Tam and Ma 2014), and the persistent production of 
inflammatory cytokines by microglia results in chronic neuroinflammation after TBI (Loane 
and Byrnes 2010). To analyze the cytokine expression in MG/Mϕ cells following TBI, we 
used a novel in situ hybridization technique for labeling specific RNA sequences in brain 
slices, combined with immunofluorescence using a cocktail of antibodies to detect the entire 
MG/Mϕ population. We used FISH as the use of antibodies against specific cytokines can 
produce variable results that may be due to the detection limit of immunohistochemistry for 
low levels of cytokines. The use of FISH improves specificity and sensitivity when 
examining cytokine mRNAs in distinct cells confirmed by antibody co-immunolabeling, 
which allows us to identify the cellular source of cytokine production following TBI with 
Villapol et al.

 greater confidence. Our data demonstrates that a mixed pattern of both pro-inflammatory 
and anti-inflammatory cytokine expression occurred in MG/Mϕ in the first week after TBI. 
In male mice, both pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines appeared at the same time-points. 
This is consistent with previous reports that there is an overlapping expression of phenotypic 
markers in MG/Mϕ following experimental TBI in male mice (Kim et al. 2016; Kumar et al. 
2016a; Morganti et al. 2016). IL1β and TNFα are two important pro-inflammatory 
cytokines produced after TBI (Kumar et al. 2016a) that are known to induce neuronal cell 
death. While MG/Mϕ cells were the primary source of TNFα mRNA, the IL1β mRNA 
signal was as much as 68% from non-microglial cells sources after TBI. There were clear 
differences in the male and female IL1β and TNFα cytokine mRNA expression levels. 
While male mice presented with a sustained cytokine peak between 1–7 dpi, there was an 
unusual biphasic peak in pro-inflammatory cytokines that occurred at 4 h post-TBI in female 
mice that retreated and peaked again at 7 dpi. The mechanism and purpose of this biphasic 
peak are not known, but the reduced expression of IL1β and TNFα at 1 and 3 dpi in female 
mice may explain the acute differences in neuroprotection between sexes.
One of the best characterized alternative-activation markers is Arg1, which contributes to 
wound healing and matrix deposition, and outcompetes iNOS to downregulate production of 
nitric oxide (Bansal and Ochoa 2003). We found a strong Arg1 signal at the lesion border at 
3 and 7 dpi in males. This is consistent with previous reports that show a sustained increase 
of Arg1 up 7 days post-TBI, with most of the Arg1 positive MG/Mϕ being hypertrophic/
amoeboid and located near the cortical lesion (Kumar et al. 2016a). However, in our study, 
only male mice showed this strong Arg1-positive signal at the lesion border. In fact, we only 
detected a significant increase in Arg1 cells in female mouse brain at 30 dpi. We also studied 
the expression of TGFβ which is thought to be an anti-inflammatory cytokine, but with 
chronic exposure can also induce pro-inflammatory responses (Cohen et al. 2014). Again we 
report a sexual dimorphism in TGFβ mRNA at 1 dpi, but this is resolved by 3 dpi.
Multiple reports have noted that females rodents appear protected against the effects of CNS 
injury compared to males (Dang et al. 2011; Fleiss et al. 2012; Igarashi et al. 2001) but 
conversely a study examining the effect of sex on TBI outcome in mice report no effect on 
lesion volume (Bruce-Keller et al. 2007; Tucker et al. 2017; Tucker et al. 2016; Xiong et al. 
2007). Most of these studies have examined a single time-point post-injury, but in the current 
study, we found that female mice had a faster resolution of TUNEL staining compared to 
male mice, which correlated with smaller lesion volume at 3 and 7 dpi. The increased 
expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in male mice occurred in the acute phase and 
could explain why male mice have increased cell death and larger lesion volume. Lesion in 
male mice followed a classical pattern that has previously been reported (Villapol et al. 
2014). However, this pattern did not occur in female mice. When we continued to study 
lesion size over time and report that by 30 dpi, we do not detect any difference in lesion 
volume between male and female mice. A limitation of our study is that our chronic 
outcome measures were restricted to histological lesion volume. We have previously shown 
that the moderate-to-severe CCI used in this study, can be difficult to distinguish from severe 
CCI when using lesion volume alone (Washington et al. 2012). Other groups have used in-
depth behavioral studies to study sex-differences after preclinical TBI. Similar to our 
findings, Tucker et al demonstrated that female mice had a similar lesion volume to male 
Villapol et al.

 mice 30 d after CCI, and presented with similar behavioral deficits in the Morris Water maze 
and rotarod test, although female mice display fewer anxiety-like behaviors after CCI 
(Tucker et al. 2017; Tucker et al. 2016). Other studies have found that female rates have 
better motor ability following TBI compared to males (Roof et al. 1993; Wagner et al. 2004). 
These confounding data may be explained by a study where the motor and cognitive 
function were assessed alongside lesion volume in male and female TBI mice. The authors 
found no difference in lesion volume or cognitive ability, but still report a significant 
reduction in foot-faults in female mice after TBI (Xiong et al. 2007). More studies are 
required to establish whether the differences in acute inflammatory responses can be 
harnessed to improve outcome in female mice after TBI.
A second limitation of our study is that we did not monitor the estrous cycle of our mice at 
the time of injury. We used random cycling in our mice to better resemble the clinical setting 
of TBI in cycling females. Previous studies have revealed that the estrous cycle stage at the 
time of the injury has no effect on post-injury neuroprotection of female mice and rats 
(Bramlett and Dietrich 2001; Monaco et al. 2013). In addition, when TBI was induced at 
random stages of the estrous cycle the performance variability was similar to that reported in 
male mice (Tucker et al. 2017; Tucker et al. 2016).
In summary, in this work, we have demonstrated that female mice are acutely more resistant 
to moderate-to-severe TBI compared to male mice, primarily due to reduced 
neuroinflammation. However, this may not result in chronic brain sparing as female and 
male mice have similar brain volume loss at 30d post-TBI. It is clear that further research 
aimed at investigating the effects of sex, microglial function, and cell death are needed to 
elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying hormonal and sex-related 
differences in the incidence and clinical course of brain injuries. Future studies will be 
essential for exploring personalized therapeutic treatments for TBI patients of both sexes.

 Figure 1. In situ hybridization combined with immunohistochemistry for analysis of the immune 
response in injured mouse brains
A. Male and female C57BL/6J mice received a controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury and 
were sacrificed at 4 hours, 1, 3, 7, or 30 days after CCI. Coronal mouse brains sections 
corresponding to the lesion area from −1.34 mm to −2.30 mm posterior to Bregma, Nissl 
stained, were selected for analysis. B. Tissue was probed for microglia/macrophages cells 
(Iba-1, darker staining) and counterstained with nuclei (dapi, blue), Brain regions (primary 
somatosensory cortex, hippocampal dentate gyrus, and thalamus) used for quantification are

Microglia/Macrophage cells detected by IHC analysis with Iba-1 antibody (E, green) in the 
lesioned cortex exhibited strong FISH for a representative fluorescence probe (red) 
counterstained with nuclei (dapi, blue) (scale bar; 20 μm). RNAscope FISH produces puncta 
spike in signal (circle red) that represents a single mRNA transcript. The red square in F 
shows an image of a puncta signal, and the illustration depicted in H demonstrates the 
process of “Z” probes hybridizing with the target transcript, and subsequent fluorophore

 Figure 2. Sex-dependent differences in microglia/macrophage morphology and activation after 
TBI
A–C TBI causes an increase in Iba-1 positive cell area in the cortex (CX) of male mice that 
is stronger than the response in female mice. Representative images of Iba-1 
immunohistochemical staining show an increase in microglial/macrophages cells in male 
mice compared to female mice at 1-day post-injury (dpi) (CX). Sex-differences are also 
observed in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG; D–F), and thalamus (TH; G–I), (Scale bar; 
50 μm). Inset images (b, c, e, f, h, i) are corresponding thresholded images used to quantify 
the percentage area occupied by Iba-1 positive cells. (J–O) A number of Iba-1 positive cells

 is classified according to microglial morphology in the primary somatosensory cortex 
located in the perilesional brain regions. Representative photos in each graph are depicting 
the five classifications of microglia/macrophage morphology (ramified; ramified with thick, 
rough prolongations; hypertrophy/bushy with pseudopodia; amoeboid with phagocytized 
cells; and amoeboid round). The total number of Iba-1 positive cells per mm2 (J) is higher in 
males compared to females at 1 and 3 dpi. We observed ramified morphology (K, inset 
representative image) in sham brains with long processes at 4 hours post-injury (hpi), absent 
at later times; the ramified morphology with rough prolongations (L, inset representative 
image) is higher in females at 4 hpi and 1 dpi compared to male injured brains, decreasing at 
3 and 7 dpi, reaching a peak at 30 dpi but without sex differences. We found hypertrophy/
bushy Iba-1 positive cells with pseudopodia (M, inset representative image) at 1 and 3 dpi in 
male brains but rarely in females until 7 dpi, microglia retract most of their processes and 
show enlargement of cell bodies. Amoeboid cells with phagocytosed cells (N, inset 
representative image) were found mainly in male brains, reaching a peak at 7 dpi, compared 
to female brains. Amoeboid round morphology (O, inset representative image) was typically 
present in males at 1 and 3 dpi and absent in females, with sex equivalence at 7 and 30 dpi. 
In chronic stages, the majority of the microglia/macrophages still had increased cell body 
size and fewer processes when compared to sham mice. Scale bar for inset representative 
images 20 μm. * = p < 0.05; *** = p < 0.001 vs. females at the same time-point. n = 5/

 Figure 3. Male, but not female, TBI mice have rapid infiltration of macrophages into the injured 
brain
Representative images indicate cortical brain sections stained with P2Y12 (resident 
microglial cells, red) and F4/80 (macrophages, green) markers, and nuclei counterstained 
with dapi (blue). No F4/80 positive cells were observed in sham (Sh) male mice (A, A1, A2, 
a3), sham female mice (B, B1, B2, b3), 4h TBI male mice (C, C1, C2, c3), or 4h TBI 
female mice (D, D1, D2, d3). F4/80 positive macrophages with amoeboid morphology 
predominantly appear at 1 dpi in the perilesional cortex of male mice (E, E1, E2, e3) but 
remain absent in female brains (F, F1, F2, f3). F4/80 positive macrophages persist at 3 dpi in 
male TBI brain (G, G1, G2, g3) but still remain absent in female TBI brain (H, H1, H2). By 
7 dpi F4/80 cells are widespread in the injured cortex of male mice (I, I1, I2, i3), and are 
apparent around the lesion in female TBI brain (J, J1, J2, j3). Quantitative graphs indicate 
an increase in F4/80 positive macrophages (K) and CD68 positive activated microglia/
macrophages cells (L) in males compared to females at all time-points. Representative 
images of CD68 positive cells (red) staining and nuclei (dapi, blue) are showing for males

 Figure 8. Sex differences in morphological and phenotypic diversity of microglia/macrophages 
following TBI
Schematic diagram illustrating the characterization of M1/M2-like microglia/macrophage 
cells (MG/Mϕ) in males and females. Both sham male and female brains present surveying 
microglia and basal levels of cytokines. Days after injury, male mice have increased levels of 
infiltrating macrophages and activated microglial cells with hypertrophied/bushy 
morphology. One week after injury, MG/Mϕ predominate in both sexes. In the frame time 
where macrophage infiltration occurs, the peak of cytokine expression is increased in males, 
while reduced in females. Both phenotypes, pro-inflammatory (IL-1β and TNFα) or anti-
inflammatory (TGFβ and Arg1) activation status, in response to injury are more prevalent in 
injured male brains compared to females.
