Abstract
Broad spectrum antiviral drugs targeting host processes could potentially treat a wide range of 
viruses while reducing the likelihood of emergent resistance. Despite great promise as 
therapeutics, such drugs remain largely elusive. Here we use parallel genome-wide high-coverage 
shRNA and CRISPR-Cas9 screens to identify the cellular target and mechanism of action of 
GSK983, a potent broad spectrum antiviral with unexplained cytotoxicity1–3. We show that 
GSK983 blocks cell proliferation and dengue virus replication by inhibiting the pyrimidine

 biosynthesis enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). Guided by mechanistic insights 
from both genomic screens, we found that exogenous deoxycytidine markedly reduces GSK983 
cytotoxicity but not antiviral activity, providing an attractive novel approach to improve the 
therapeutic window of DHODH inhibitors against RNA viruses. Together, our results highlight the 
distinct advantages and limitations of each screening method for identifying drug targets and 
demonstrate the utility of parallel knockdown and knockout screens for comprehensively probing 
drug activity.
Introduction
The development of effective broad spectrum antiviral therapies remains a highly attractive 
(but equally challenging) goal in drug discovery. Antivirals targeting host cell processes 
have great potential to demonstrate activity against a range of viruses, reduce the likelihood 
of mutational resistance, and serve as frontline therapies for rapidly emerging outbreaks of 
viral disease such as Ebola and influenza4. However, extensive efforts to develop such drugs 
have been stymied by various factors, including on-target toxicity and limited in vivo 
activity5. Recently, cell-based phenotypic screens of chemical libraries have generated 
numerous host-targeting broad spectrum antiviral lead compounds with unidentified targets 
and mechanisms of action1,6–8. Thus, the development of improved methods for target 
identification and mechanism elucidation – critical challenges in drug discovery – should 
facilitate the development of more effective broad spectrum antiviral therapies.
High-throughput yeast deletion and RNAi-based screening approaches have emerged as 
powerful alternatives to drug target identification methods that utilize affinity-based 
chemoproteomics or chemical-genetic expression signatures9–13; reviewed in14,15. We 
recently developed high-coverage shRNA libraries (25 shRNAs/gene) that facilitate pooled 
genome-wide screening in mammalian cells with dramatically improved hit reliability16–19. 
While our high-coverage shRNA libraries have demonstrated utility in identifying small 
molecule drug targets20,21, genome-wide screening is no longer limited to RNAi-mediated 
gene knockdown. The recent development of the CRISPR-Cas9 system has greatly expanded 
the scope of genomic screening in mammalian cells by enabling facile interrogation of 
functional gene deletions22–28. Here, we demonstrate a comprehensive strategy using 
parallel genome-wide shRNA and CRISPR-Cas9 screens to discover the previously 
unknown host cell target and mechanism of action of GSK983 (1), a poorly understood 
broad spectrum antiviral lead compound with unexplained cytotoxicity.
We found that GSK983 blocks virus replication and arrests the growth of rapidly dividing 
cells by inhibiting the cellular de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis enzyme dihydroorotate 
dehydrogenase (DHODH). Furthermore, we show that exogenous deoxycytidine greatly 
reduces GSK983 cytotoxicity but not activity against RNA virus replication, providing a 
novel strategy to improve the therapeutic window of DHODH inhibitors against RNA 
viruses. Finally, we propose that efficacy of broad spectrum antiviral therapies targeting host 
pyrimidine metabolism might be improved by pharmacological inhibition of both de novo 
pyrimidine biosynthesis (via DHODH) and pyrimidine ribonucleoside salvage (via uridine-
cytidine kinase, UCK2).

 Results
Biological activity of GSK983
We first examined the biological activity of GSK983 (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Results, 
Supplementary Fig. 1a) in human K562 cells. GSK983 inhibited K562 cell growth with an 
IC50 of 21 nM (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1b), consistent with previous observations1. 
Cell cycle analysis revealed that 24 h GSK983 treatment caused an accumulation of K562 
cells in S phase (Supplementary Fig. 1c,d), while prolonged 72 h treatment induced a dose-
dependent increase in K562 cell death by apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. 1e,f).
shRNA and CRISPR-Cas9 screens for target identification
We previously established a platform for pooled RNAi screens using ultracomplex shRNA 
libraries (~25 shRNAs per gene and ~10,000 negative control shRNAs)16–19. More recently, 
we systematically optimized several features of our shRNA design to create a next-
generation shRNA library, which performs comparably to our CRISPRi library29. For the 
shRNA screen described here, we infected K562 cells with our next-generation shRNA 
library targeting the entire human protein-coding genome. For the CRISPR-Cas9 screen, we 
designed a CRISPR single-guide RNA (sgRNA) library targeting the entire human protein-
coding genome (~4 sgRNAs per gene and ~2,000 negative control sgRNAs) incorporating 
previously reported improvements to the sgRNA stem loop30. We stably infected this 
CRISPR sgRNA library into a K562 cell line constitutively expressing Cas9 endonuclease. 
For both screens, we split cells expressing the genome-wide shRNA or sgRNA library and 
cultured them in the presence or absence of 48 nM GSK983 for 10–14 days. We then 
isolated genomic DNA from untreated and GSK983-treated cells, PCR-amplified shRNA- or 
sgRNA-encoding DNA constructs, and counted all constructs by deep sequencing.16 (Fig 
1c,d).
We used deep sequencing data from the shRNA screen to rank genes according to a 
maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) metric that we designed to consider the magnitude of 
sensitization to or protection against GSK983 conferred by the entire set of shRNAs 
targeting each gene. Similarly, we used deep sequencing data from the CRISPR-Cas9 screen 
to rank genes according to the median fold-change in sgRNA frequency in the untreated 
versus GSK983-treated cell populations (Supplementary Datasets 1,2)27.
Analysis of genomic screen results
Inspection of the top 10 hit genes from both screens revealed clear signatures from three 
major biological pathways (Fig. 1e). Knockdown or knockout of genes whose products are 
required for coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) biosynthesis and function (HMGCR, PDSS1, PDSS2, 
COQ2, COQ9, and COQ10B) protected K562 cells against GSK983 (Fig. 1e and 
Supplementary Fig. 2a,b). In contrast, shRNA-mediated knockdown of pyrimidine 
metabolism genes (DHODH and CMPK1) sensitized K562 cells to GSK983 (Fig. 1e and 
Supplementary Fig. 2b), as did CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of components of the 
GATOR1 protein complex (NPRL2 and DEPDC5), a recently identified negative regulator 
of mTORC1 activity (Fig. 1e)31,32. Interestingly, mammalian pyrimidine biosynthesis 
utilizes CoQ1033 and is subject to regulation by mTORC134,35.

 As expected, genes required for essential processes such as nucleotide biosynthesis (e.g., 
DHODH and CMPK1) that appeared as top hits in the shRNA knockdown screen did not 
appear as statistically significant hits in the CRISPR-Cas9 deletion screen (Fig. 1f and 
Supplementary Datasets 1,2). Conversely, certain genes (e.g., mTOR signaling components 
NPRL2, TSC2, SEH1L, MAPKAP1, RICTOR, RHEB, and TBC1D7) were statistically 
significant hits in the CRISPR-Cas9 screen but not in the shRNA screen (Fig. 1f and 
Supplementary Datasets 1,2). A number of genes were statistically significant hits in both 
screens, including PDSS1, PDSS2, and UCK2. GO enrichment analysis of the top 50 hits 
from each screen revealed that CoQ10 biosynthesis genes were significantly overrepresented 
among top hits from both screens, while pyrimidine metabolism genes were significantly 
overrepresented among top hits from the shRNA screen alone (p < 0.001 in all cases) 
(Supplementary Tables 1,2)36. Thus, our findings demonstrate the complementary power of 
parallel shRNA and CRISPR-Cas9 screens to identify connections between biological 
pathways that may be difficult to detect using either screening approach alone.
We individually retested multiple shRNAs targeting top hit genes to validate genomic screen 
results (Supplementary Tables 3,4). Using a competitive growth assay, we verified both the 
sensitized phenotype conferred by DHODH or CMPK1 knockdown and the protected 
phenotype conferred by knockdown of several CoQ10 biosynthesis genes (Fig. 1g and 
Supplementary Fig. 3a–c). We also used QPCR to confirm the efficacy of selected shRNAs 
targeting DHODH and CMPK1 (Supplementary Fig. 3d,e). Similarly, we individually 
retested top hit sgRNAs from the CRISPR-Cas9 screen to verify both that NPRL2 or 
DEPDC5 knockout sensitized K562 cells to GSK983 and that knockout of CoQ10 
biosynthesis genes protected K562 cells against the drug (Fig. 1h,i and Supplementary Fig. 
4a). Additionally, we retested CRISPR sgRNAs targeting selected top hit genes in HeLa 
cells and obtained similar results, albeit with milder phenotypes, indicating that these 
genetic modifiers of GSK983 sensitivity are not K562-specific (Supplementary Fig. 4a,b).
GSK983 inhibits cellular dihydroorotate dehydrogenase
While the CRISPR-Cas9 and shRNA screens each highlighted unique hit genes and together 
provided a more complete understanding of the biological activity of GSK983, we 
considered that the highly sensitizing hits in the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway were 
among the most likely candidates to be molecular targets of GSK983. We reasoned that cells 
expressing an shRNA against a protein target of GSK983 should be highly sensitized to 
GSK983-induced growth inhibition. Consequently, we focused our target identification 
effort on the pyrimidine metabolism genes DHODH and CMPK1, which were the top 
sensitizing hits from our genome-wide shRNA screen. Mammalian cells derive pyrimidine 
(deoxy)ribonucleotide triphosphates either from de novo biosynthesis or pyrimidine salvage, 
in which intact pyrimidine metabolites are recycled from intracellular nucleic acid 
degradation or imported into the cell from exogenous sources (Fig. 2a). DHODH 
(dihydroorotate dehydrogenase) is required for de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, while 
CMPK1 plays a critical role in both de novo biosynthesis and pyrimidine salvage (Fig. 2a).
To determine whether GSK983 inhibited DHODH, we examined the ability of 
dihydroorotate and orotate (the substrate and product of DHODH, respectively) to reverse

 the anti-proliferative effect of GSK983 in K562 cells. Dihydroorotate supplementation had 
no effect on GSK983-induced growth inhibition (Fig. 2b). In sharp contrast, exogenous 
orotate reversed the anti-proliferative effect of GSK983 in dose-dependent fashion, with full 
rescue of K562 cell growth at the highest orotate concentration tested (Fig. 2c). We obtained 
identical results in HeLa cells (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). Together, these data strongly 
suggested that GSK983 is a DHODH inhibitor.
To confirm DHODH as a GSK983 target, we expressed and purified the recombinant human 
enzyme from E. coli and examined the effect of GSK983 on in vitro enzyme activity, using 
the known DHODH inhibitor teriflunomide as a positive control (reported Ki = 179 nM)37. 
GSK983 was a competitive inhibitor of DHODH with respect to decylubiquinone binding 
(Ki = 403 nM) (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 5c,d). To determine whether the reported 
antiviral effect of GSK983 could be attributed to DHODH inhibition, we resynthesized three 
GSK983 analogues originally prepared and evaluated at GlaxoSmithKline2,3. The extent to 
which each compound (GSK983, 6Br-pF (2), 6Br-oTol (3), and GSK984 (4)) inhibited 
DHODH activity in vitro correlated strongly with the reported potency of each compound in 
cell-based antiviral assays (R2 = 0.993) (Fig. 2d,e and Supplementary Fig. 5d–g)3. 
Collectively, these findings indicated that the antiviral effect of GSK983 is due to DHODH 
inhibition.
To determine whether GSK983 inhibited CMPK1, we expressed and purified the 
recombinant human enzyme from E. coli; however, we observed no effect of GSK983 on in 
vitro CMPK1 activity. Thus, although CMPK1 was the most sensitizing hit in the shRNA 
screen (followed by DHODH), the encoded protein is not a direct GSK983 target. 
Nonetheless, it is logical that shRNA-mediated CMPK1 knockdown is highly toxic in the 
presence of GSK983, given that CMPK1 knockdown should further impair both de novo 
pyrimidine biosynthesis and pyrimidine salvage (Fig. 2a).
A new strategy to exploit DHODH as an antiviral target
While there are examples of small molecule DHODH inhibitors that potently block virus 
replication38–40, prolonged treatment with DHODH inhibitors causes pyrimidine depletion 
that arrests the growth of rapidly dividing cells. Indeed, the FDA-approved drugs 
leflunomide (rheumatoid arthritis) and teriflunomide (multiple sclerosis) are DHODH 
inhibitors that prevent the rapid clonal expansion of activated lymphocytes, a process which 
requires significantly elevated cellular pyrimidine levels41,42. We were therefore interested 
in separating the antiviral effect of GSK983 from its anti-proliferative (and cytotoxic) effect 
on rapidly dividing cells.
Guided by the appearance of pyrimidine salvage enzymes among the top sensitizing hits 
from both genomic screens, we examined the ability of pyrimidine salvage metabolites to 
reverse the anti-proliferative effect of GSK983 on rapidly dividing cells. Uridine, cytidine, 
or deoxycytidine supplementation reversed GSK983-induced growth inhibition to varying 
extents in K562 cells (Fig. 3a,b and Supplementary Fig. 6a,b). However, cellular salvage of 
exogenous ribonucleosides (uridine and cytidine) can sustain RNA virus replication despite 
DHODH inhibition40,43. We reasoned that deoxycytidine salvage would support DNA but 
not RNA virus replication given that ribonucleotides cannot be directly biosynthesized from

 their 2′-deoxy analogues. This raised the intriguing possibility of using a DHODH inhibitor 
to block RNA virus replication in combination with a deoxycytidine supplement to reverse 
the anti-proliferative effect on rapidly dividing cells.
To test this therapeutically relevant hypothesis, we studied the antiviral effect of GSK983 on 
dengue virus (DENV), an RNA virus that has rapidly emerged as the most prevalent 
mosquito-transmitted virus worldwide and currently causes approximately 100 million 
infections annually in tropical regions44. We compared the effects of exogenous uridine and 
deoxycytidine on the ability of GSK983 to inhibit DENV replication in human A549 cells. 
In the absence of exogenous pyrimidines, GSK983 potently inhibited DENV replication 
(IC50 = 13.3 nM) (Fig. 3c). As expected, uridine supplementation completely abolished the 
antiviral activity of GSK983 (Fig. 3c). In sharp contrast, exogenous deoxycytidine did not 
reverse GSK983-mediated inhibition of DENV replication (IC50 = 13.5 nM) (Fig. 3c). We 
conducted a cell growth assay conducted in parallel with antiviral experiments to confirm 
that both uridine and deoxycytidine reduced GSK983 cytotoxicity and rescued A549 cell 
growth (Fig. 3d), consistent with previous results in K562 cells. Notably, treatment with 30 
nM GSK983 and 1 mM deoxycytidine caused a significant (~90%) reduction in DENV 
replication (Fig. 3c) with a minimal effect on A549 cell growth (Fig. 3d). Thus, 
deoxycytidine supplementation partially reversed the anti-proliferative effect of GSK983 but 
did not preclude potent inhibition of DENV replication (Fig. 3e,f).
We additionally tested the effect of GSK983 on the replication of another RNA virus, 
Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV). GSK983 inhibited VEEV replication with an 
IC50 of 12.8 nM (Supplementary Fig. 6e). As with DENV, we observed that exogenous 
uridine reversed the antiviral effect of GSK983, while deoxycytidine supplementation had 
no effect on antiviral activity. Furthermore, we found that exogenous orotic acid, but not 
dihydroorotic acid, reversed the antiviral effect of GSK983. Collectively, these results 
indicate that GSK983 potently inhibits replication of RNA viruses by inhibiting cellular 
DHODH.
Further analysis revealed that exogenous deoxycytidine reversed GSK983-induced S phase 
cell cycle arrest (Fig. 3g and Supplementary Fig. 7a,b) and cytotoxicity (Supplementary Fig. 
7c–e) at 3 days in K562, HeLa, and A549 cells. Deoxycytidine supplementation also 
markedly reduced teriflunomide toxicity in K562 cells (Supplementary Fig. 7f). These 
findings suggest that deoxycytidine may reverse the anti-proliferative effect of DHODH 
inhibitors by sustaining cellular DNA synthesis during S phase. We observed that the 
capacity of exogenous deoxycytidine to reverse GSK983 toxicity is significant but 
diminished during extended GSK983 treatment (6 days) (Supplementary Fig. 6c,d), likely 
due to the inability of deoxycytidine to alleviate the blockade of cellular RNA biosynthesis 
caused by pharmacological inhibition of DHODH.
Data from our genome-wide shRNA and CRISPR-Cas9 screens also suggested a novel 
combination chemotherapy to achieve improved activity against RNA viruses by targeting 
host pyrimidine metabolism. Both shRNA-mediated knockdown and CRISPR-Cas9-
mediated deletion of the pyrimidine metabolism enzyme UCK2 (uridine-cytidine kinase) 
sensitized K562 cells to GSK983, presumably by impairing uridine and cytidine salvage

 (Fig. 2a). This result suggests that pharmacological inhibition of UCK2 might enhance the 
antiviral activity of a DHODH inhibitor by preventing flux through the ribonucleoside 
salvage pathway from sustaining RNA virus replication. Thus, we propose that an effective 
and specific UCK2 inhibitor might act synergistically with a DHODH inhibitor to achieve 
improved activity against RNA viruses. Notably, UCK2 inhibition should not impair 
deoxycytidine salvage, which proceeds via a different pathway (Fig. 2a). Therefore, the 
possibility of using deoxycytidine to reduce the toxicity of a combination therapy targeting 
UCK2 and DHODH remains viable.
Discussion
Here, we have demonstrated the utility of parallel genome-wide shRNA and CRISPR-Cas9 
screens (Fig. 1c,d) for identifying the target and mechanism of action of a poorly understood 
therapeutic lead compound, a strategy which should be broadly applicable to other bioactive 
small molecules. We found that the broad spectrum antiviral compound GSK983 blocks 
viral replication and arrests the growth of rapidly dividing cells by inhibiting the cellular de 
novo pyrimidine biosynthesis enzyme DHODH.
Our approach takes advantage of unique properties of each screening technology. shRNA-
mediated knockdown of a gene encoding the protein target of a drug is expected to 
phenocopy pharmacological inhibition of the target. Therefore, we predicted that GSK983 
would be more toxic to cells expressing an shRNA against a gene that encoded a protein 
target of the compound. Furthermore, the broad spectrum of shRNA-mediated knockdown 
efficiency should facilitate identification of essential genes that modulate GSK983 toxicity. 
At the same time, CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knockout should enable detection of non-
essential genes that require full deletion to produce an observable phenotype.
Indeed, we found that genes required for essential biological processes such as nucleotide 
biosynthesis and metabolism (e.g., DHODH and CMPK1) appeared as statistically 
significant hits in the shRNA screen but not in the CRISPR-Cas9 screen. However, other 
genes (most notably those involved in mTOR signaling and regulation) only appeared as 
statistically significant hits in the CRISPR-Cas9 screen, presumably because shRNA-
mediated knockdown of these genes was insufficient to produce a measurable phenotype. 
Thus, our findings demonstrate the complementary power of parallel shRNA and CRISPR-
Cas9 screens to identify connections between biological pathways that may be difficult to 
detect using either screening approach alone.
We focused our target identification efforts on the pyrimidine metabolism genes DHODH 
and CMPK1, which appeared as the most sensitizing hits in our genome-wide shRNA screen 
and were therefore most likely to be molecular targets of GSK983. DHODH is a 43 kDa 
mitochondrial flavoprotein that requires a CoQ10 cofactor for activity and catalyzes the 
fourth and rate-limiting step in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway (the oxidation 
of dihydroorotate to orotate). CMPK1 is a 22 kDa cytosolic nucleoside monophosphate 
kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of uridine 5′-monophosphate (UMP), cytidine 5′-
monophosphate (CMP), and 2′-deoxycytidine 5′-monophosphate (dCMP) to the 
corresponding nucleotide diphosphates (Fig. 2a). Notably, CMPK1 plays a critical role in

 both de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis and salvage of pyrimidine ribonucleosides and 
deoxyribonucleosides (Fig. 2a).
Subsequent biochemical assays using recombinant human DHODH and CMPK1 
demonstrated that GSK983 inhibited the activity of DHODH but not CMPK1. Thus, we 
reasoned that we could exploit the pyrimidine salvage pathway to separate the antiviral 
activity of GSK983 from its cytotoxic effect on rapidly dividing cells. Indeed, exogenously 
added deoxycytidine alleviated GSK983-induced S phase cell cycle arrest and largely 
reversed GSK983 cytotoxicity, presumably by facilitating continued cellular DNA synthesis 
via the deoxyribonucleoside salvage pathway. However, deoxycytidine supplementation did 
not reverse the potent activity of GSK983 against RNA viruses (DENV and VEEV), because 
the ribonucleotides required for RNA biosynthesis cannot be directly formed biochemically 
from their 2′-deoxy analogues. This finding provides an attractive novel approach to improve 
the therapeutic window of DHODH inhibitors; however, it is important to note that this 
strategy is likely limited in applicability to RNA viruses. Exogenous deoxycytidine would 
presumably sustain DNA virus replication via the deoxyribonucleoside salvage pathway 
notwithstanding pharmacological inhibition of DHODH.
There are numerous examples of small molecule DHODH inhibitors that potently block 
virus replication in cell-based assays38–40. However, the relevance of DHODH as a target for 
RNA virus therapies has been questioned because these compounds rarely achieve in vivo 
efficacy39,40. One plausible explanation for this phenomenon is that circulating plasma 
uridine levels in mammals often exceed concentrations that have been shown to reverse the 
antiviral effect of DHODH inhibitors in cell-based assays39,40. Therefore, RNA virus 
replication can likely be sustained via uridine salvage despite pharmacological inhibition of 
DHODH.
Mechanistic insights from our genome-wide shRNA and CRISPR-Cas9 screens suggest a 
novel combination chemotherapy that may improve the in vivo activity of a DHODH 
inhibitor as an RNA virus therapy. The pyrimidine salvage enzyme UCK2 (uridine-cytidine 
kinase) strongly sensitized cells to GSK983 in both screens. Thus, an effective and specific 
UCK2 inhibitor should act synergistically with a DHODH inhibitor to achieve improved 
activity against RNA viruses by preventing ribonucleoside salvage. Here, deoxycytidine 
salvage would remain intact, limiting toxicity for host cell DNA replication.
Finally, our dual genomic screening strategy identified other major biological pathways 
(mTOR regulation and CoQ10 biosynthesis) that affect cellular pyrimidine metabolism. 
Nonetheless, the mechanisms by which these pathways modulate cellular sensitivity to 
GSK983 remain poorly understood. Together, our results highlight the importance of 
genome-wide knockdown and knockout screening as a means of comprehensively 
interrogating both essential and non-essential genes, and demonstrate the utility of this 
approach as a functional platform enabling small molecule target identification and rational 
therapy design.

Chemicals and reagents for biological assays
GSK983 was synthesized as described below. Teriflunomide was obtained from Sigma-
Aldrich and was used as received. GSK983 and teriflunomide were dissolved in DMSO to 
prepare stock solutions which were diluted in the appropriate cell growth medium for 
biological assays. GSK983 and teriflunomide stock solutions in DMSO were stored at 
−80 °C. Uridine, cytidine, deoxycytidine, and dihydroorotic acid were obtained from Sigma-
Aldrich. Orotic acid was obtained from Fisher Scientific. For pyrimidine supplementation 
experiments, pyrimidine metabolites (uridine, cytidine, deoxycytidine, orotic acid, and 
dihydroorotic acid) were dissolved directly in the appropriate growth medium (RPMI or 
DMEM). 5-Ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) and Azide-fluor 488 were obtained from Sigma-
Aldrich and dissolved in DMSO to prepare working stock solutions. Copper (II) sulfate 
(CuSO4) and ascorbic acid were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and were used as received. 7-
aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) was obtained from Life Technologies and dissolved in 
DMSO to prepare a working stock solution.
Cell culture
K562 cells (ATCC) were cultured in RPMI (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine 
serum (FBS), penicillin/streptomycin, and L-glutamine. HeLa cells (HeLa-Kyoto cells, a gift 
from AA Hyman) and A549 cells (ATCC) were cultured in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented 
with 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, and L-glutamine. In biological assays, HeLa cells 
and A549 cells were detached from the growth surface using a trypsin/EDTA solution 
(Gibco) prior to analysis. Cells were maintained in logarithmic growth during all biological 
assays. All cell lines were maintained in a humidified incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2), and 
checked regularly for mycoplasma contamination.
GSK983 dose response and growth time course in K562 cells
To determine the dose response of K562 cells to GSK983, K562 cells were seeded into 24-
well plates at a density of 50,000 cells/mL and treated with GSK983 at the indicated 
concentration for 72 h. Following 72 h treatment, cells were harvested and the density of 
viable cells was determined by flow cytometry (FSC/SSC) using a BD Accuri C6 Flow 
Cytometer. IC50 values were calculated by fitting a 4-parameter logistic equation to the data.

K562 cells were seeded into 6-well plates at a density of 100,000 cells/mL. HeLa and A549 
cells were seeded into 6-well plates at a density of 200,000 cells/well. Cells were treated 
with the indicated concentration of GSK983 for 24 h. Where specified, cells were treated for 
24 h with deoxycytidine alone (1 mM), GSK983 and deoxycytidine (1 mM), or neither

 (untreated). Following 24 treatment, cells were harvested and pelleted (300g, 5 min). The 
supernatant was removed by vacuum and the cells were washed (0.5 mL 1x PBS). Cells 
were resuspended in 70% EtOH (1 mL, 0 °C) with mild vortexing. Cells were fixed in 70% 
EtOH overnight at 4 °C. The following day, fixed cells were pelleted (1900g, 5 min), washed 
(0.5 mL 1x PBS), and resuspended in 200 μL of a total DNA content staining solution (1x 
PBS with 50 μg/mL RNase A and 10 μg/mL propidium iodide). Samples were incubated for 
30 min at 37 °C and analyzed by flow cytometry using a BD Accuri C6 Flow Cytometer. 
Propidium iodide fluorescence was detected in FL2.
Annexin V-FITC/7-AAD apoptosis assay
K562 cells were seeded into 24-well plates at a density of 50,000 cells/mL and treated with 
the indicated concentration of GSK983 for 72 h. The final concentration of DMSO in each 
well was < 0.1%. Following 72 h GSK983 treatment, cells were harvested and pelleted 
(399g, 5 min). The supernatant was removed by vacuum. Cell death by apoptosis was 
analyzed using a BioVision Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Kit (catalog number K101–100). A 
staining solution was prepared by first diluting the provided Annexin V-FITC solution in 
binding buffer according to the specifications of the manufacturer. 7-AAD was added from a 
stock solution in DMSO (0.67 mg/mL) such that the final concentration of 7-AAD in the 
staining solution was 2.5 μg/mL. Cell samples were resuspended in 0.5 mL of the staining 
solution. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 10 min in the dark and analyzed 
by flow cytometry using a BD Accuri C6 Flow Cytometer. FITC fluorescence was detected 
in FL1 and 7-AAD fluorescence was detected in FL3. Note: The BioVision Annexin V-FITC 
Apoptosis Kit includes propidium iodide for detection of necrotic cells. However, we found 
that the use of 7-AAD for necrotic cell staining greatly facilitated flow cytometric analysis 
in this assay. Compared to the emission spectrum of propidium iodide, the red-shifted 
emission spectrum of 7-AAD has significantly less overlap with the emission spectrum of 
FITC.
Genome-wide shRNA screen
We infected our next-generation genome-wide lentiviral shRNA library into K562 cells as 
described previously16–18. Infected cells were expanded and split into two flasks. In one 
flask, cells were grown in the presence of 48 nM GSK983 for 14 days, while in the other 
flask, cells were grown in the absence of GSK983. Untreated cells were diluted to a density 
of 500,000 cells/mL each day. GSK983-treated cells were diluted to a density of 500,000 
cells/mL as needed. After the cell culture period, untreated and GSK983-treated cells were 
pelleted by centrifugation. Genomic DNA was isolated and shRNA encoding-constructs 
were counted by deep sequenced as described previously16–18.
Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen
To conduct the CRISPR-Cas9 screen, we first designed a genome-wide CRISPR sgRNA 
library with 4 sgRNAs/gene, incorporating previously reported improvements to the sgRNA 
Cas9 binding region30. Coding sequence models for sgRNA design were based on CCDS. 
sgRNAs were targeted toward the 5′ end of transcripts, and sgRNAs targeted exons common 
to all transcripts wherever possible. sgRNAs were 19–25 base pairs long and were adjacent 
to an NGG at the 3′ end. sgRNAs also contained an endogenous 5′G. Where multiple

 possible sgRNA lengths existed, only one was picked at random to ensure that no two 
sgRNAs targeted the same PAM. sgRNAs were scored for off-targets as previously 
described23 and the most stringent score (e39m1) was used wherever possible. Negative 
control sgRNAs were designed against scrambled coding sequences and filtered for zero off-
targets in the genome.
We generated a K562 cell line stably expressing Cas9 endonuclease by infecting K562 cells 
with SFFV-Cas9-BFP, which is identical to a vector described previously23 but containing 
Cas9 with both active catalytic sites. We infected our newly designed lentiviral genome-wide 
sgRNA library into Cas9-expressing K562 cells according to the procedures described for 
lentiviral infection of shRNA libraries16–18. Infected cells were expanded and split into two 
flasks. In one flask, cells were initially treated with 6 and 12 nM GSK983 with little effect; 
therefore the concentration of GSK983 was increased to 48 nM to ensure strong selection. 
Cells were grown in the presence of 48 nM GSK983 for 10 days. In the other flask, cells 
were grown in the absence of GSK983. After the cell culture period, genomic DNA was 
isolated from the untreated and GSK983-treated cells using a Qiagen DNA Blood Maxi kit 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To prepare the sgRNA sequencing library, the 
integrated sgRNA-encoding constructs were PCR amplified using Agilent Herculase II 
Fusion DNA Polymerase with primers oMCB_1562 (5′-
AGGCTTGGATTTCTATAACTTCGTATAGCATAC ATTATAC-3′) and oMCB_1563 (5′-
ACATGCATGGCGGTAATACGGTTATC-3′). PCR reactions contained 5x Herculase buffer 
(20 μL), dNTPs (1 μL of 10 mM stock), genomic DNA (10 μg), primer oMCB_1562 (1 μL 
of 100 μM stock), primer oMCB_1563 (1 μL of 100 μM stock), Herculase II Fusion DNA 
Polymerase (2 μL), and water (to adjust final reaction volume to 100 μL). The number of 
PCR reactions was scaled to use all of the isolated genomic DNA from the untreated and 
GSK983-treated cells. The conditions for the PCR reaction were as follows: 1x 98 °C/2 min, 
18x 98 °C/30 s, 59.1 °C/30 s, 72 °C/45 s, 1x 72 °C/3 min. PCR amplicons from genomic 
DNA isolated from untreated cells were pooled, as were PCR amplicons from genomic 
DNA isolated from GSK983-treated cells. The pooled PCR amplicons from the untreated 
and GSK983-treated samples were further amplified in a subsequent PCR reaction using 
primer oMCB_1349 (5′-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATGCACAA 
AAGGAAACTCACCCT-3′) and a bar-coded primer (5′-AATGATACGGCG 
ACCACCGAGATCTACACGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCAGTCACNNNNN
NC GACTCGGTGCCACTTTTTC-3′), where N’s indicate Illumina index barcodes. For the 
second PCR reaction, the reaction mixtures contained 5x Herculase buffer (20 μL), dNTPs 
(2 μL of 10 mM stock), an aliquot of the amplicon from the first PCR reaction (5 μL), 
oMCB_1439 (0.8 μL of 100 μM stock), barcoded primer (0.8 μL of 100 μM stock), 
Herculase II Fusion DNA Polymerase (2 μL), and water (69.4 μL). The conditions for the 
second PCR reaction were as follows: 1x 98 °C/2 min, 20x 98 °C/30 s, 59.1 °C/30 s, 
72 °C/45 s, 1x 72 °C/3 min. The PCR products from the untreated and GSK983-treated 
samples were separated by gel electrophoresis (20% TBE-PAGE, 120 V, 50 min), and then 
gel purified to obtain sgRNA sequencing libraries.

 Ranking genes from genome-wide shRNA and CRISPR-Cas9 screens
Given the variance in the efficiency of shRNA-mediated gene knockdown, we developed a 
novel maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) to approximate the maximum effect size of the 
collective set of shRNAs targeting each gene. The distribution of shRNAs for a given gene 
was fit to a mixed model with three distributions: off-target, miss, and on-target. The off-
target distribution corresponds to the shRNA knocking down a gene other than its intended 
target and is estimated from the distribution of all shRNAs other than the negative controls. 
The missed distribution corresponds to the shRNA having no effect and is estimated from 
the distribution of all negative control shRNAs. Both estimations were performed by 
Gaussian kernel smoother with the bandwidth determined by Scott’s rule. Finally, the on-
target distribution is the uniform distribution from 0 to I, where I is a fitted parameter and 
corresponds to the estimated effect size. This allows for the fact that a given shRNA can be 
anywhere from 0 to 100 percent effective at knocking down the targeted gene product. The 
relative contribution of the missed and the on-target distribution was also fitted, allowing for 
different numbers of shRNAs to be considered on-target. The contribution of the off-target 
distribution was fixed at 10% to allow for outliers. The significance of the MLE was tested 
using a log likelihood ratio, where the p-values were empirically determined by Monte-
Carlo sampling of all shRNAs other than the negative controls.
To call and rank hit genes from the shRNA screen, enrichment values for each shRNA were 
first calculated as the log ratio of the frequency of the shRNA-encoding construct in 
genomic DNA isolated from the untreated and GSK983-treated cell populations16. For each 
gene, the MLE described above was used to estimate both the effect of the set of shRNAs 
targeting the gene and a p-value representing the significance of that estimate. Genes were 
then filtered by significance under the Bonferroni correction at p < 0.05 and ranked 
according to the effect size estimate.
To rank genes from the CRISPR-Cas9 screen, we first filtered genes with fewer than four 
distinct targeting sgRNAs detected in the deep sequencing data. The effect size was then 
calculated as the median fold-enrichment value for the set of sgRNAs targeting a given gene. 
Custom Python scripts for analysis of both screens will be made available upon request.
GO enrichment analysis
GO enrichment analysis was performed using Enrichr (GO Biological Process option)36. 
Separate GO enrichment analyses were performed on the top 50 hit genes from the shRNA 
screen and the CRISPR-Cas9 screen. All p values were adjusted using the Benjamini-
Hochberg correction for false discovery rate. Supplementary Table 1 shows all enriched GO 
categories from the shRNA screen with p < 0.01. Supplementary Table 2 shows all enriched 
GO categories from the CRISPR-Cas9 screen with p < 0.01.
Lentivirus production and lentiviral infections for individual shRNA retests
Pairs of oligonucleotides encoding shRNAs targeting top hit genes were annealed and 
ligated into the pMCB309 vector backbone, which was previously digested with BstXI and 
gel-purified. pMCB309 encodes two BstXI cut sites, puromycin resistance, and mCherry. 
Oligonucleotides were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). The plasmid map

 will be provided upon request. The sequences of the shRNA-encoding oligonucleotides that 
were ligated into pMCB309 for individual retesting are shown in Supplementary Table 3.
To produce lentivirus for individual shRNA retests, Mirus transfection reagent (catalog 
number MIR2305) (2.5 μL) was added to DMEM containing no FBS (97.5 μL) and 
incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Meanwhile, pMCB309 containing the indicated 
shRNA-encoding insert (0.75 μg) was combined with 3rd generation lentiviral packaging 
components (pMDL, pRSV, and pMD2 – available from Addgene) (0.75 μg). The total DNA 
mixture (pMCB309 with shRNA encoding insert + lentiviral packaging components) was 
added to the DMEM/Mirus mixture and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. 
Meanwhile, HEK293T cells were seeded into 6-well plates at a density of 1 million cells/
well in 2 mL DMEM. Transfection mixtures were added to HEK293T cells dropwise and 
cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. The following day, cells were supplemented with 3 
mL fresh DMEM. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for an additional 48 h. To harvest the virus, 
the supernatant was collected and passed through a 0.45 μm syringe filter.
To infect K562 cells with lentivirus, K562 cells were seeded into 24-well plates at a density 
of 100,000 cells/well in a volume of 100 μL. Polybrene (2 μL of a 4 mg/mL stock solution) 
was added to the cells, followed by 1 mL of the appropriate lentivirus stock. Cells were spin 
infected in 24-well plates for 2 h at 1000g at 33 °C. Following spin infection, cells were 
resuspended and pelleted (300g, 5 min). The supernatant was removed by aspiration and the 
cells were resuspended in fresh RPMI growth medium and incubated for 72 h at 37 °C. The 
cells were expanded into 6-well plates and grown in the presence of puromycin (1.0 μg/mL) 
for 3–5 days to select for infected cells. Following puromycin selection, cells were pelleted 
(300g, 5 min) and resuspended in fresh RPMI growth medium.
Competitive growth assays for individual shRNA retests
Competitive growth assays for individual shRNA retests were conducted as follows: 250,000 
K562 cells expressing a negative control shRNA or an shRNA targeting a gene of interest 
(mCherry+) and 250,000 uninfected K562 cells (mCherry−) were seeded into 24-well plates. 
Heterogeneous cell mixtures were cultured in the presence or absence of 48 nM GSK983 for 
14 days. As in the genome-wide shRNA screen, untreated cells were diluted to a density of 
500,000 cells/mL each day and GSK983-treated cells were diluted to a density of 500,000 
cells/mL as needed. Two wells each of untreated cells and GSK983-treated cells were 
cultured for each shRNA retested. The proportion of mCherry+ cells was monitored by flow 
cytometry every 72 h using a BD Accuri C6 Flow Cytometer (mCherry fluorescence 
detected in FL3).
Data was analyzed as follows: for each shRNA retested, the percentage of mCherry+ cells in 
the two untreated wells was averaged, as was the percentage of mCherry+ cells in the two 
GSK983-treated wells (Supplementary Figure 3b,c). The ratio of the average percentage of 
mCherry+ cells in the treated and untreated cell populations was calculated to give an 
mCherry enrichment ratio for each shRNA retested. Thus, an mCherry enrichment ratio < 1 
indicates that mCherry+ cells are depleted in the GSK983-treated cell population versus the 
untreated cell population. In contrast, an mCherry enrichment ratio > 1 indicates that 
mCherry+ cells are enriched in the GSK983-treated cell population versus the untreated cell

 population. For each shRNA, the logarithm of the mCherry enrichment ratio was calculated. 
A Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney U Test was performed to compare the log(mCherry enrichment 
ratio) values for the set of shRNAs targeting each hit gene to the log(mCherry enrichment 
ratio) values for the set of negative control shRNAs. Using this competitive growth assay, we 
confirmed that knockdown of DHODH and CMPK1 sensitized K562 cells to GSK983, 
while knockdown of COQ2, PDSS2, PDSS1, and COQ10B protected K562 cells against 
GSK983 in good agreement with genomic screen results [Fig. 1g; bar length represents 
average log(mCherry enrichment ratio) for each gene and error bars represent standard 
deviation of log(mCherry enrichment ratio) values for each gene].
qPCR to confirm efficacy of individual shRNA reagents
We confirmed the efficacy of shRNAs DHODH_1, DHODH_2, CMPK1_2, and CMPK1_4 
using qPCR according to procedures described previously16, and values were normalized 
first to levels of RPL19, and then to the first of two negative control shRNAs. The following 
primers were used for qPCR experiments:

Lentivirus production and lentiviral infections for individual sgRNA retests
Pairs of oligonucleotides encoding sgRNAs targeting top hit genes were annealed and 
ligated into the pMCB306 vector backbone, which was previously double digested with 
BstXI and Blp1 and gel-purified. In addition to BstXI and Blp1 cut sites, pMCB306 encodes 
puromycin resistance and GFP. Oligonucleotides were obtained from Integrated DNA 
Technologies (IDT). The plasmid map will be provided upon request. The sequences of the 
sgRNA-encoding oligonucleotides that were ligated into pMCB306 for individual retesting 
are shown in Supplementary Table 4. Lentivirus production for single sgRNA retests, spin 
infection into K562 cells, and puromycin selection of infected K562 cells were performed 
exactly as described in the procedure for individual shRNA retests.
Selected sgRNAs were also retested in HeLa cells. Lentiviral infection and puromycin 
selection of HeLa cells was performed as follows: HeLa cells were seeded into 24-well 
plates at a density of 50,000 cells/well. DMEM containing the appropriate lentivirus (1mL) 
was added to each well and cells were incubated for 72 h at 37 °C. Cells were expanded into 
6-well plates and grown in the presence of puromycin (1 μg/mL) for 3–5 days to select for 
infected cells. DMEM containing puromycin was removed and the cells were re-plated in 
fresh growth medium.

 Competitive growth assays for individual sgRNA retests
For competitive growth assays to retest individual sgRNAs in K562 cells, 250,000 cells 
expressing an sgRNA targeting a gene of interest (GFP+) and 250,000 cells expressing an 
sgRNA targeting GFP (GFP−) were seeded into 24-well plates. Cells were cultured in the 
presence or absence of 48 nM GSK983 for 12 days. Untreated cells were diluted to a density 
of 500,000 cells/mL each day and GSK983-treated cells were diluted to a density of 500,000 
cells/mL as needed. Two wells each of untreated cells and GSK983-treated cells were 
cultured for each sgRNA retested. The proportion of GFP+ cells was monitored by flow 
cytometry every 48–72 h using a BD Accuri C6 Flow Cytometer (GFP fluorescence detected 
in FL1).
For competitive growth assays to retest individual sgRNAs in HeLa cells, 10,000 cells 
expressing an sgRNA targeting a gene of interest (GFP+) and 10,000 cells expressing an 
sgRNA targeting GFP (GFP−) were seeded into 24-well plates. Plated cells were incubated 
for 24 h at 37 °C. Following 24 h incubation, the growth medium in each well was removed 
and cells were provided fresh growth medium with or without 48 nM GSK983. Cells were 
cultured in the presence or absence of 48 nM GSK983 for 13 days. Cells were split back 8-
fold every 72 h in order to ensure that cell growth remained logarithmic. Two wells each of 
untreated cells and GSK983-treated cells were cultured for each sgRNA retested. The 
proportion of GFP+ cells was monitored by flow cytometry every 72 h using a BD Accuri 
C6 Flow Cytometer (GFP fluorescence detected in FL1).
Cloning, expression, and purification of recombinant human DHODH
Endogenous human DHODH contains a 29 residue N-terminal mitochondrial signal peptide. 
Here, we expressed and purified a truncated DHODH lacking the N-terminal signal peptide 
(Δ29DHODH) to facilitate detergent-free purification and increase the solubility of the 
recombinant enzyme in aqueous buffers. Others have shown that the Δ29DHODH construct 
retains full catalytic activity despite the N-terminal truncation45. The DNA sequence 
encoding human DHODH was PCR-amplified from a cDNA template (Origene, SC128197) 
using Δ29DHODH forward primer: 5′-
ACGACAAGCATATGGCCACGGGAGATGAGCG-3′ and Δ29DHODH reverse primer: 5′-
GCGACCCGAATTCGGCCGCCGATGATCTGCTCCA ATGGC-3′. The PCR reactions 
contained 1xGC-Rich Buffer (NEB), DMSO (4%), Phusion High-fidelity DNA Polymerase 
(NEB) (0.05 unit/μL), dNTPs (2 mM), MgCl2 (1.5 mM), cDNA template (20 ng) and 
primers (1 μM each). An annealing temperature of 53.9 °C was used for PCR amplification. 
The amplified insert was cloned into pET21a using NdeI and EcoRI restriction sites to form 
a construct encoding Δ29DHODH with a C-terminal His6 tag.
Expression of recombinant human DHODH was performed as described previously33. 
Briefly, E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with a pET21a plasmid containing an 
insert encoding Δ29DHODH. Single colony transformants were grown in a 37 °C shaker for 
12–15 h in 50 mL of 2xYT medium (Sigma Aldrich) supplemented with 100 μg/mL 
ampicillin. A 20 mL aliquot of bacterial culture was centrifuged at 5000g for 10 min. The 
supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellet was resuspended in fresh 2xYT medium (20 
mL). The resuspended cells were added to 2 L of 2xYT medium containing 100 μg/mL

 ampicillin, and the culture was grown aerobically at 37 °C until A600 was ~ 0.6 to 0.8. IPTG 
(0.1 mM) and flavin mononucleotide (100 μM) were added and the culture was grown 
aerobically at 25 °C for an additional 20 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000g 
for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting cell paste was stored at −80 °C prior to protein purification.
Recombinant human Δ29DHODH was purified as follows: cell paste (30 g) was thawed and 
resuspended in ~100 mL start buffer containing HEPES (50 mM, pH 7.7), NaCl (300 mM), 
glycerol (10% v/v), and Triton X-100 (0.5% v/v). The cells were lysed by sonication (35% 
amplitude, 4.0 s pulse, 9.0 s pause, 15 min). The sample was centrifuged at 23,700g for 45 
min (Beckman JA-20 rotor) and the supernatant was passed through a 0.45 μm syringe filter. 
The sample was loaded onto a 5 mL HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). 
The column was washed with 20 mL each of start buffer containing 5 and 10 mM imidazole. 
The desired Δ29DHODH protein was eluted by gradually increasing the imidazole 
concentration to 500 mM. The eluate was collected in several fractions, which were 
analyzed by Tris-SDS-PAGE (4–20% polyacrylamide gradient). The fractions containing the 
desired protein were combined and concentrated to a volume of less than 2 mL using an 
Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter unit with a 10 kDa molecular mass cut off (Millipore). An 
Amicon filter was used to exchange the concentrated protein into a storage buffer containing 
HEPES (50 mM, pH 7.7), KCl (300 mM), and glycerol (10% v/v). Following buffer 
exchange, Δ29DHODH was aliquoted, flash frozen with liquid nitrogen, and stored at 
−80 °C.
In vitro enzyme activity assays with recombinant human Δ29DHODH
Δ29DHODH activity was measured in the presence of teriflunomide, GSK983, and GSK983 
analogues using a coupled assay in which the oxidation of dihydroorotic acid (DHO) and 
subsequent reduction of ubiquinone is stoichiometrically equivalent to the reduction of 2,6-
dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP)46. The reduction of DCPIP can be monitored by the loss 
of absorbance at 610 nm (ε = 21,500 M−1cm−1). Kinetic constants were calculated from 
measurements in which Δ29DHODH (10 nM) was either titrated with different 
concentrations of decylubiquinone (QD, 10–60 μM) at a fixed concentration of DHO (200 
μM) or titrated with different concentrations of DHO (10–60 μM) at a fixed concentration of 
QD (100 μM). Enzymatic assays were conducted at 25 °C in a reaction buffer containing Tris 
(100 mM, pH 8.0), NaCl (150 mM), DCPIP (60 μM), glycerol (10% v/v), and Triton X-100 
(0.1% v/v). The Km values for Δ29DHODH (15 μM for DHO and 14 μM for QD) were in 
good agreement with previously reported values for both the full-size and N-terminally 
truncated enzyme45. To determine Ki values for inhibitor compounds (teriflunomide, 
GSK983, 6Br-pF, 6Br-oTol, and GSK984), Δ29DHODH (10 nM) and the appropriate 
inhibitor compound were added to the previously described reaction buffer. For each 
inhibitor compound, three reactions were prepared: a control reaction containing no inhibitor 
and two reactions containing different inhibitor concentrations. Δ29DHODH was incubated 
with inhibitor compounds at room temperature for 5 min. The indicated concentration of QD 
and DHO (200 μM) were added to the reaction mixtures and absorbance at 610 nm was 
monitored using a PerkinElmer Lamda 25 UV-Vis spectrophotometer.

 For enzyme activity assays, inhibitor compounds were prepared as 1 mM stock solutions in 
DMSO. A QD stock solution (10 mM) was prepared in a buffer containing Tris (100 mM, 
pH 8.0) and Triton X-100 (1.0 % v/v). A DHO stock solution (10 mM) was prepared in a 
buffer containing Tris (100 mM, pH 8.0). Concentrated stocks of inhibitor compounds, QD, 
and DHO were further diluted as needed with a buffer containing Tris (100 mM, pH 8.0) and 
Triton X-100 (0.1 % v/v) to prepare working stocks. The total volume of the reaction 
mixture for each assay was 100 μL, and the final concentration of DMSO was 0.01% (v/v).
Cloning, expression, and purification of recombinant human CMPK1
The DNA sequence encoding human CMPK1 (196 amino acid residues) was PCR-amplified 
from a cDNA template (GE Healthcare Dharmacon, catalog number MHS6278-202832682) 
using the forward primer 5′-AAAAAACATATGAAGCCGCTG GTCGTGTTC-3′ and the 
reverse primer 5′-CACGTCTAAAAACTGTTCCTTCC GATTCCTAGGTTTTTT-3′ and 
gel-purified. The PCR-amplified CMPK1-encoding construct was double digested with NdeI 
and BamHI-HF (New England BioLabs) in CutSmart buffer for 4h at 37 °C and PCR-
purified (Thermo GeneJet PCR Purification Kit). Similarly, vector pET28 was double 
digested with NdeI and BamHI-HF for 3 h at 37 °C and gel-purified. The CMPK1-encoding 
insert was ligated into digested pET28 using T4 DNA Ligase (Invitrogen).
E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with a pET28 plasmid containing a CMPK1-
encoding insert. Single colony transformants were grown in 5 mL of LB growth medium 
containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin for 16 h at 37 °C. Overnight starter culture (2.5 mL) was 
added to 1 L of LB growth medium containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin and grown at 37 °C for 
~3 h. IPTG (150 μM) was added when A600 was ~0.65. Cells were grown at 18 °C for an 
additional 16 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000g for 20 min at 4 °C. The 
resulting cell paste was stored at −80 °C prior to protein purification.
Recombinant human CMPK1 was purified as follows: cell paste was thawed and 
resuspended in 50 mL of lysis buffer containing Tris (40 mM, pH 7.5), NaCl (10 mM), NaF 
(5 mM), and DTT (1 mM). Cells were lysed by sonication and centrifuged at 25,000g for 1 
h. The supernatant was incubated with a slurry of Ni-NTA resin for 1 h at 4 °C and loaded 
onto a column. The column was washed with 40 mL lysis buffer, then 20 mL each of buffers 
containing Tris (40 mM, pH 7.5), NaCl (10 mM), DTT (1 mM), and imidazole (10, 40, or 
200 mM). The eluate was examined by SDS-PAGE and fractions containing CMPK1 were 
combined. Isolated CMPK1 was further purified by anion exchange chromatography using 
an Äkta Pure 25 FPLC instrument equipped with a 5 mL Hi Trap Q anion exchange column. 
Prior to loading onto the anion exchange column, the combined Ni-NTA column eluate 
containing CMPK1 was diluted in Buffer A containing Tris (50 mM, pH 8.0) and DTT (1 
mM) such that the imidazole concentration in the diluted sample was less than 50 mM. The 
desired protein was eluted from the anion exchange column using a linear gradient from 0 to 
95% Buffer B containing Tris (50 mM, pH 8.0), DTT (1 mM), and NaCl (500 mM) over 15 
column volumes. Fractions containing the desired protein were spin-concentrated to a 
volume of less than 1 mL using an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter unit with a 10 kDa 
molecular mass cut off (Millipore). An Amicon filter was used to exchange the concentrated 
CMPK1 into a storage buffer containing Tris (50 mM, pH 7.5) and glycerol (10% v/v).

 Following buffer exchange, purified CMPK1 was aliquoted, flash frozen with liquid 
nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C.
In vitro enzyme activity assays with recombinant human CMPK1
The activity of recombinant human CMPK1 was measured in the presence of GSK983 using 
an ATP consumption assay. CMPK1 (10 nM) was added to a reaction buffer containing Tris 
(50 mM, pH 7.5), MgCl2 (2 mM), DTT (2 mM), ATP (100 μM), CMP (100 μM), and 
GSK983 (0–10 μM, from a DMSO stock solution). The final concentration of DMSO in all 
reaction mixtures was 2% (v/v). Enzyme activity assays were conducted at 37 °C. The 
consumption of phosphoryl donor ATP was monitored using a Promega Kinase-Glo 
Luminescent Kinase Assay kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. We observed no 
effect of GSK983 on CMPK1 activity in vitro at GSK983 concentrations up to 10 μM.
Pyrimidine metabolite supplementation experiments
For pyrimidine metabolite supplementation experiments in K562 cells, cells were seeded 
into 24-well plates at a density of 50,000 cells/mL in RPMI growth medium containing the 
indicated concentration of pyrimidine metabolite and the indicated concentration of 
DHODH inhibitor (GSK983 or teriflunomide) where applicable. Pyrimidine metabolites 
were dissolved directly in the growth medium. GSK983 and teriflunomide were delivered 
from stock solutions in DMSO as described above. Cells were incubated in the presence of 
exogenous pyrimidines and the indicated DHODH inhibitor at 37 °C for 72 h. Following 72 
h treatment, cells were harvested and the density of viable cells was determined by flow 
cytometry (FSC/SSC) using a BD Accuri C6 Flow Cytometer. For 6 day experiments, cells 
were plated as described above and diluted to a density of 50,000 cells/mL after 3 days using 
fresh growth medium containing the appropriate concentrations of GSK983 and pyrimidine 
metabolites, and cell viability was assessed after an additional 3 days (6 days total) as 
described above.
For pyrimidine metabolite supplementation experiments in HeLa and A549 cells, cells were 
seeded into 24-well plates at a density of 20,000 cells/well and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. 
Following 24 h incubation, the growth medium in each well was removed and replaced with 
fresh DMEM containing the indicated concentration of pyrimidine metabolite and GSK983. 
Pyrimidine metabolites were dissolved directly in the growth medium. GSK983 was 
delivered from a stock solution in DMSO as described above. Cells were incubated in the 
presence of exogenous pyrimidines and GSK983 at 37 °C for an additional 72 h. Following 
72 h treatment, cells were harvested and the density of viable cells was determined by flow 
cytometry (FSC/SSC) using a BD Accuri C6 Flow Cytometer.
Cell cycle analysis based on 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation
K562 cells were treated with 48 nM GSK983, 1 mM deoxycytidine, both 48 nM GSK983 
and 1 mM deoxycytidine, or neither (untreated) for 24 h. Cells were seeded into 6-well 
plates at a density of 200,000 cells/mL. The final concentration of DMSO in each well was < 
0.1%. After 24 h incubation with GSK983/deoxycytidine, cells were treated with 10 μM 
EdU for 2 h. EdU-treated cells were harvested, pelleted (300g, 5 min), washed (0.5 mL 1x 
PBS), and resuspended in 70% EtOH (1 mL, 0 °C) with mild vortexing. Cells were fixed in

 70% EtOH overnight at 4 °C. The following day, fixed cells were pelleted (1900g, 5 min), 
washed (0.5 mL 1x PBS) and resuspended in 200 μL of a freshly prepared EdU labeling 
solution containing Tris-HCl (100 mM, pH 8.5), CuSO4 (1mM), ascorbic acid (100 mM), 
and the azide-functionalized fluorophore Azide-fluor 488 (10 μM). Cells were incubated in 
the EdU labeling solution in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. The cells were 
pelleted (475g, 5 min), and the supernatant was removed by vacuum. Cells were washed 
twice (0.5 mL 1x PBS for each wash). Following the second PBS wash, cells were 
resuspended in 200 μL of a freshly prepared total DNA content staining solution containing 
7-AAD (25 μg/mL in 1x PBS; 7-AAD diluted in PBS from a stock solution in DMSO). Cells 
were incubated in the total DNA content staining solution in the dark at room temperature 
for 20 min. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using a BD Accuri C6 Flow Cytometer. 
Azide-fluor 488 fluorescence was detected in FL1. 7-AAD fluorescence was detected in 
FL3. In a first control experiment, cells that had not been treated with EdU were subjected to 
the dual staining protocol described above. In the absence of EdU treatment, we observed no 
specific labeling of S phase cells (data not shown). In a second control experiment, cells that 
had been incubated with 10 μM EdU for 2 h were stained with 7-AAD alone. In the absence 
of Azide-fluor 488, we observed no specific labeling of S phase cells (data not shown).
Construction of pDENV-Luc infectious clone
The design of the DENV reporter used here was based on the previously described mDV-R 
construct47. Briefly, the viral 5′UTR was followed by a duplication of the first 104 
nucleotides of the C coding region, which contains cis-acting elements required for 
replication (CAE). The CAE was fused to the Renilla luciferase coding region followed by 
the complete DENV open reading frame (ORF). Between the Renilla luciferase and DENV 
structural protein coding sequences, a foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) 2A sequence 
was introduced to provide co-translational cleavage and luciferase release. The construct was 
based on pD2/IC-30P, which contains a full-length infectious clone encoding dengue virus 
serotype 2 strain 1668148. We introduced an Envelope Q399H mutation to enhance viral 
infection in mammalian cells using a QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Agilent 
Technologies) (primers: 5′-GGAAGTTC TATCGGCCACATGTTTGAGACAAC-3′ and 5′-
GTTGTCTCAAACATGTGGCCGATAGA ACTTCC-3′). We gene-synthesized a fragment 
containing the T7 polymerase promoter sequence followed by the first 102 nucleotides of the 
C coding region in frame with the Renilla luciferase and FMDV 2A sequences. This 
fragment was PCR-amplified, introducing a SacI site at the 5′ end and a NheI site (present in 
the FMDV 2A sequence) at the 3′ end using primers: 5′-CGAAATTCGAGCTCACGCG-3′ 
and 5′-TCCTGCTAGCTTGAGCAAATCAAAGTTC-3′. To create an in-frame fusion of 
FMDV 2A with the DENV-ORF, a second DNA fragment was PCR-amplified from a pD2/
IC-30P template (primers: 5′-TCAAGCTAGCA 
GGAGACGTTGAGTCCAACCCCGGGCCCATGAATAACCAACGGAAAAAGGCG-3′ 
and 5′-GGAAGAGCATGCAG TCGGAAATG-3′), thus introducing 5′ NheI and 3′ SphI 
restriction sites. The two fragments were cut with the respective restriction enzymes and 
ligated into pD2/IC-30P (previously digested with SacI and SphI) to create pDENV-Luc. 
DENV-Luc virus was produced via in-vitro transcription of pDENV-Luc and transfection 
into BHK cells as described previously48.

 DENV antiviral assays
For DENV inhibition assays (Fig. 3c), human A549 cells were seeded into 24-well plates at 
a density of 20,000 cells/well and incubated for 24 h. The cells were treated with DMEM 
containing GSK983 at the indicated concentrations for 4 h at 37 °C. Growth medium 
containing GSK983 was removed and cells were incubated for 1 h with DENV-Luc (no 
GSK983) at 37 °C. Following DENV-Luc incubation, cells were washed with 1x PBS and 
treated with fresh DMEM containing GSK983 at the indicated concentrations. Cells were 
incubated at 37 °C for an additional 72 h. Where specified, the growth medium was 
supplemented with 1 mM uridine or 1mM deoxycytidine. DENV-Luc replication was 
monitored by the production of Renilla luciferase, which was measured using the Renilla-
Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the specifications of the manufacturer.
For the accompanying cell viability assay (Fig. 3d), A549 cells were seeded into 24-well 
plates at a density of 20,000 cells/well incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Cells were then treated 
with GSK983 at the indicated concentration for 72 h. Where specified, the growth medium 
was supplemented with 1 mM uridine or 1 mM deoxycytidine. Following 72 h treatment, 
cells were harvested and the density of viable cells was determined by flow cytometry (FSC/
SSC) using a BD Accuri C6 Flow Cytometer.
VEEV antiviral assays
A plasmid encoding the recombinant VEEV-GFP genome (vaccine strain TC-83) was kindly 
provided by Professor Frolov (University of Alabama at Birmingham)49. This plasmid was 
used to generate replication competent VEEV (capable of expressing GFP upon infection) in 
Huh7 cells. For the VEEV inhibition assay (Supplementary Fig. 6e), human A549 cells were 
seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 10,000 cells per well and incubated for 24 h at 
37 °C in DMEM containing GSK983 only (at the indicated concentrations), or 
supplemented with 1 mM uridine, 1mM deoxycytidine, 1 mM dihydroorotic acid, or 1 mM 
orotic acid. Following this incubation, VEEV-GFP (at an MOI of 20 plaque forming units/
cell) was added to the media and cells were further incubated for 16 hours at 37 °C. GFP 
expression was then used to measure VEEV-GFP replication in the infected samples using 
flow cytometry. All flow cytometry was performed using a BD LSRFortessaTM cell analyzer 
(BD Biosciences) and data was analyzed and assembled using FlowJo software (TreeStar, 
Inc.).

Deoxycytidine (dC) reverses the anti-proliferative effect of GSK983 but not antiviral 
activity. Uridine (a) and deoxycytidine (b) largely reversed GSK983-induced growth 
inhibition in K562 cells. For (a) and (b), viable cells were counted by flow cytometry (FSC/
SSC) following 72 h treatment with 48 nM GSK983 or vehicle and the indicated 
concentration of uridine or deoxycytidine. Error bars represent ± standard deviation of 4 
biological replicates. (c) GSK983 inhibited replication of luciferase-expressing DENV in 
A549 cells (black). 1 mM uridine reversed antiviral activity (blue), while 1 mM 
deoxycytidine did not (red). Error bars represent ± standard deviation of 3 biological 
replicates. (d) Uridine (blue) and deoxycytidine (red) reversed GSK983-induced growth 
inhibition in A549 cells. Viable cells were counted by flow cytometry (FSC/SSC) following 
72 h treatment with no exogenous pyrimidines (control), 1 mM uridine, or 1 mM 
deoxycytidine and the indicated concentration of GSK983. Error bars represent ± standard 
deviation of 3 biological replicates. (e) Ribonucleoside (uridine) salvage sustains both RNA 
virus replication and cellular DNA synthesis. (f) Deoxyribonucleoside (deoxycytidine) 
salvage sustains cellular DNA synthesis but not RNA virus replication. For (e) and (f), Pyr = 
pyrimidine, rNuc = ribonucleotides, dNuc = deoxyribonucleotides. (g) Deoxycytidine

 reversed GSK983-induced S phase cell cycle arrest in K562 cells. Following 24 h treatment 
with 48 nM GSK983, cells were treated with 10 μM 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) for 2 
h and fixed in 70% EtOH. Cells were stained with Azide-fluor 488 and 7-AAD and analyzed 
by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry plots depict one of three biological replicates.
