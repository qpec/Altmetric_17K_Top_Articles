 Abstract 
Background: It is commonly believed lifting is dangerous and the back should be straight 
during lifting.   These beliefs may arise from healthcare professionals, yet no study has 
evaluated the lifting and back beliefs of manual handling advisors (MHAs) and physiotherapists 
(PTs). 
Objectives: To evaluate (i) what lifting technique MHAs and PTs perceive as safest, and why, 
and (ii) the back pain beliefs of MHAs with PTs. 
Design: Data was collected via an electronic survey.  
Method: Participants selected the safest lifting posture from four options: two with a straight 
back and two with a more rounded back, with justification.  Back beliefs were collected via the 
Back-Pain Attitudes Questionnaire (Back-PAQ). Relationships were investigated using multiple 
linear and logistic regression models. 
Results: 400 PTs and MHAs completed the survey.  75% of PT and 91% of MHAs chose a 
straight lifting posture as safest, mostly on the basis that it avoided rounding of the back. 
MHAs scored significantly higher than PTs on the Back-PAQ instrument (mean difference = 
33.9), indicating more negative back beliefs.  Those who chose the straight back position had 
significantly more negative back beliefs (mean 81.9, SD 22.7) than those who chose a round 
back lift (mean 61.7, SD 21.1). 
Conclusion: Avoiding rounding the back while lifting is a common belief in PT and MHA, despite 
the lack of evidence that any specific spinal posture is a risk factor for low back pain.  MHAs, 
and those who perceived a straight back position as safest, had significantly more negative 
back beliefs.

Introduction 
Low back pain (LBP) is a large and growing issue in Western societies (ref), and work absence 
due to back pain is socially and economically expensive (ref). The reasons for this increasing 
problem are much debated, but what is clear is that LBP, especially when it persists, is a 
complex disorder driven by a number of factors across a wide biopsychosocial spectrum (ref).  
In this regard, while there is evidence that physical demands of work are associated with LBP, 
they only account for a modest proportion of LBP in the workforce (Waddel and Burton, 2001). 
In the prevention of LBP, employers commonly use manual handling training for their staff.  
This training often involves teaching people how to lift, as lifting is the main way of loading the 
spine and is often cited as provocative in those with LBP (ref). However, the evidence that 
lifting is a risk factor for LBP is debatable.  Cumulative back loading has been associated with 
LBP (Coenen et al., 2013), yet there is no proven causal link between lifting and LBP (Wai et al., 
2010).  In fact, mechanical loading parameters in general have not been shown to be 
independently causative of LBP (Roffey et al. 2010; Roffey (b) et la., 2010; Roffey (c) et al., 
2010; Roffey (d) et la., 2010; Roffey (e) el at., 2010; Wai (b) et al., 2010; Wai (c) et al., 2010).  
More specifically, there is no in vivo evidence that lifting with a round back is a predictor for 
LBP, nor that lifting with a straight back is safer, despite this being a widely held belief. This 
may help to explain why teaching people how to lift has not been shown to be effective in 
preventing LBP (Hignett, 2003; Maher, 2000; Bos et al., 2006; Matimo et al., 2008) 
 Back beliefs that are consistently held in those with LBP are that their spine is a vulnerable 
structure that is easily injured and in need of protection (Darlow et al., 2015).  These beliefs 
have, in part, been shown to come from their treating healthcare professional (Darlow et al., 
2013), and clinicians’ beliefs affects their clinical management (Daykine and Richardson, 2004).  
To date, the back pain beliefs of MHAs have not been assessed, an important consideration as 
they advise others regarding the risks of LBP.  
There is an emerging view that certain advice to protect the back may not always be helpful in 
the treatment of LBP (O’Sullivan et al., 2016); and, in fact, may fuel a cycle of negative beliefs 
and thoughts leading to fear and protective behaviours that maintain the disorder (O’Sullivan, 
2005). For example it has been shown that those with LBP lift cautiously; they move slower 
when the bend, bend their back less, and co-activate the muscles supporting the spine – 
thereby bracing themselves (Ferguson et al., 2004; Rudy et al., 2003; Slaboda et al., 2008).  
This way of movement is less efficient and linked to greater spinal loading which may be pro-
nociceptive (Marras et al., 2001). This cautious way of lifting also reflects commonly taught 
lifting strategies, where individuals are advised to keep the back straight and bend their knees.  
The theory that squat lifting in this manner is the safest way to lift comes from in vitro data 
suggesting that it is harder to injure certain elements of the spine when the natural lordotic 
curve of the spine is maintained, and bending is avoided (Callaghan and McGill, 2001).  
However, this has not been confirmed in-vivo (Dreischarf et al., 2016, Kingma et la., 2010).  
Indeed, lifting with a round back has actually been shown to be more efficient (Holder, 2013). 
It is plausible that teaching those with back pain to keep their back straight when they lift and 
the belief that the spine is vulnerable may in fact be unhelpful.   
To date little is known about the beliefs of PTs and MHAs regarding lifting. O’Sullivan et al., 
(2012) showed that physiotherapists tended to prefer more upright sitting postures over 
 flexed postures as best for the back and choosing this posture was associated with more 
negative beliefs about back pain. We hypothesise the same relationship will be observed for 
lifting, where those with more negative attitudes about back pain will believe straight back 
lifting is safest, and this will be associated with more negative back beliefs.   
The aims of this study are therefore: 
1. 
To determine which lifting posture PTs and MHAs think is the safest, and why.  
2. 
To investigate factors (e.g. profession, sex, experience) associated with lifting posture 
beliefs. 
3. 
To investigate factors associated with back pain beliefs. 
4. 
To investigate the relationship between lifting posture beliefs and back pain beliefs.  
Methods 
Participants 
Participants, either MHAs or PTs, were recruited in three ways: (i) using an email sent to all 
members of the National Back Exchange – an association set up to promote evidence-based 
practice among manual handling advisors; (ii) by advertisements placed on the Chartered 
Society of Physiotherapy web page; and (iii) via dissemination of Twitter links to the study.  
Those who did not work with individuals with back pain were asked not to participate.  
Generating photographs  
After consultation with professional colleagues, four sample lifting postures were chosen 
(Figure 1).  These reflected common lifting techniques.    A 37-year-old male with no history of 
LBP and adequate flexibility to assume these postures was used as a model.

 Data collection 
Demographic, health and employment data on participants was collected via an electronic 
survey, including: age, sex, occupation (PT or MHA), main country of work, years of experience, 
whether or not specific qualifications in manual handling (MH) had been obtained, whether or 
not the participant taught MH techniques to others, and whether or not the participant had 
LBP within the last 12 months.  
Information on whether participants taught MH techniques to others was elicited only from 
those who reported that they had obtained specific qualifications in MH: other information 
was collected from all participants.  
The back pain beliefs for each participant were collected via the Back-PAQ survey (Darlow et 
al., 2014]. This survey comprises 34 Likert-style items, each with 5 possible responses.  The 
survey has been designed to highlight beliefs that are thought to be unhelpful for recovery 
from an episode of back pain; for example, beliefs about the vulnerability of the back, 
relationship between pain and injury, prognosis of back pain, activity and back pain, and 
psychological influences on back pain. Scores from these items were summed to give an 
overall score of back pain beliefs.  A range of scores from 34 to 170 is possible, with higher 
scores indicating more unhelpful beliefs – for instance, that the back is easily injured and in 
need of protection.  This outcome measure has been shown to have adequate internal 
consistency, construct validity and test-retest reliability (Rushworth, 2015) 
Data relating to participants’ opinions on safe back lifting posture, and responses to the Back-
PAQ survey, was also collected via the electronic survey. When selecting an optimum posture 
from four possible options (figure 1), participants were asked: “Assume the load in the box is a 
weight that the subject finds heavy, but possible to lift.  Which lift do you consider to be the 
safest?”  Two of the postures corresponded to different versions of a straight back lifting and 
 answers were combined to form a “straight” group; the remaining two corresponded to 
varying degrees of a rounded back of lifting posture and were combined to form a “rounded” 
group.  In addition a comment box was provided asking: “Why have you chosen this 
technique”.  
Data Analysis 
The sample was summarised descriptively. A series of 2 tests for association and uncontrolled 
logistic and linear regression analyses were conducted as screening procedures for the lifting 
position and Back-PAQ outcomes; considering the association between the appropriate 
outcome and each of the predictor variables in turn. Any variable that appeared to show some 
substantive relationship with the outcome measure was carried forward for inclusion in a 
multiple model. Automated modelling strategies were not utilised. Model goodness-of-fit, 
discrimination and calibration, collinearity between predictors and linearity of the logit were 
assessed using standard procedures. 
The significance of the difference in Back-PAQ score between those choosing a straight or 
rounded back lifting posture, controlling for other covariates, was also assessed as a secondary 
analysis using an independent samples t-test.   
The qualitative comments of each participant justifying their choice of safest lift (393/400) 
were first grouped into the same “straight” and “rounded” categories. Thereafter, words were 
grouped together into common themes and the frequency of these themes compared 
descriptively between the “straight” and “rounded” categories.  
Ethics  
Approvals were attained from South West Yorkshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, UK, 
who sponsored the study. The electronic questionnaire included an information page 
 informing participants of the purpose of the study and providing assurances of anonymity. 
Consent was assumed by completion of the questionnaire.

Back lifting posture outcome 
Only 65 PTs (24.4%) and 12 MHAs (9.1%) selected one of the two rounded back lifting postures 
(in preference to the alternative two straight back lifting postures). Nine respondents who had 
reported having LBP within the previous 12 months (13.8%) and 68 respondents who had not 
reported having LBP within the previous 12 months (20.4%) selected a rounded back lifting 
posture. 24 respondents who had specific qualifications in moving and handling with teaching 
experience (13.0%), three respondents who had specific qualifications in moving and handling 
but no teaching experience (9.7%), and 50 respondents who did not have specific qualifications 
in moving and handling (27.5%) selected a rounded back lifting posture. The screening tests 
revealed choice of lifting posture to be substantively associated with Occupation, LBP, 
Qualifications-Teaching and Experience, which were all carried forward for inclusion in a 
multiple logistic regression model.   
The multiple logistic regression model revealed evidence that, controlling for other factors and 
covariates, the odds of PTs choosing a rounded back posture were about two and a half times 
the odds of MHAs choosing a rounded back posture (OR=2.44; 95% CI 1.19 to 5.00; p=0.015).  
The model also revealed evidence that, controlling for other factors and covariates, the odds of 
choosing a rounded back posture were about four times less in those with specific MH 
qualifications than those without (OR=0.278; 95% CI 0.080 to 0.964; p=0.044); and about two 
times less in those with specific MH qualifications with teaching experience than those without 
 (OR=0.519; 95% CI 0.285 to 0.945; p=0.032). Experience of LBP was not significantly associated 
with choice of back lifting posture. 
No evidence was revealed for collinearity between included variables in the multiple model; or 
for non-linearity of the logit with respect to numerical predictors. 
Odds ratios, associated 95% confidence intervals and p-values of all tested parameters are

The model was found to classify 80.6% of cases correctly. The Nagelkerke pseudo-R2 statistic of 
0.102 suggested that the data was an adequate fit to the model. The Hosmer and Lemeshow 
test revealed no evidence that the model was not adequately calibrated (2(8)=2.59, p=0.958); 
i.e. the observed and predicted probabilities agreed well over the entire range of probability 
values.  
 
Back-PAQ score outcome 
The uncontrolled linear regression screening models revealed that occupation, recent LBP and 
specific qualifications in manual handling with teaching experience were substantively 
 associated with Back-PAQ score; all of which were all carried forward for inclusion in a multiple 
linear regression model.  The screening models revealed no evidence that length of experience 
was associated with the Back-PAQ score. 
PTs scored a mean of 67.4 points (SD 18.6) on the Back-PAQ survey, whereas MHAs scored a 
mean of 101.3 points (SD 15.9). Those with back pain within the last 12 months scored a mean 
of 81.8 points (SD 26.0) on the Back-PAQ survey; those without back pain within the last 12 
months scored a mean of 77.2 points (SD 23.3).  Those with specific MH qualifications with 
teaching experience scored a mean of 88.6 points (SD 22.1) on the Back-PAQ survey; those with 
specific MH qualifications but no teaching experience scoring a mean of 68.5 points (SD 15.0), 
those without specific MH qualifications scored a mean of 68.9 points (SD 22.1). 
The multiple linear regression model revealed that, after controlling for other factors and 
covariates, MHAs scored 30.7 points more than PTs on the Back-PAQ scale (95% CI: -35.1 to 
26.3). Consequently, occupation was significantly associated with Back-PAQ score (p<0.001). 
The model also revealed evidence that, controlling for other factors and covariates, those who 
had both specific qualifications in MH, and teaching experience, scored 6.33 points more on the 
Back-PAQ scale (95% CI: 2.20 to 10.5) compared to those who had no teaching experience 
(regardless of specific qualifications). Thus, qualifications in MH with teaching experience was 
significantly associated with Back-PAQ score (p=0.003). 
The model revealed no evidence that a participant experiencing LBP within the last 12months 
was associated with Back-PAQ score, controlling for other factors and covariates (p=0.696). 
Residual analysis indicated no violations of regression assumptions. No evidence was revealed 
for collinearity between included variables in the multiple model. 
 Parameter estimates, associated 95% confidence intervals and p-values of all tested 
parameters are summarised in Table 3.

Analysis of relationship between outcome measures 
The mean Back-PAC score amongst participants who selected a rounded back lifting posture was 
61.7 (SD 21.1). The mean Back-PAC score amongst participants who selected a straight back 
lifting posture was 81.9 (SD 22.7). An independent samples t-test found this difference of 20.1 
to be statistically significant (p<0.001; 95% CI: 14.5 to 25.7). 
Qualitative appraisal of lift choice 
The main reason given by participants for choosing a straight back lift as safest (n=319) was 
because it was either ‘neutral’ or ‘straight’ (n=143). Other reasons were that the posture allowed 
‘good use of the legs’ (n=118), ‘got the load in close’ (n= 107), involved ‘proper head posture’ 
(n=61), looked the ‘most efficient’ (n=28), involved ‘good back posture’ (but not specifically what 
posture) (n=19), and it ‘protects the back’ (n=15).  
The main reason for why the rounded group (n=74) chose that life as safest was the fact it looked 
the ‘most efficient’ way of lifting (n=21).  Other reasons that emerged were that it looked the 
‘most natural’ position (n=19), looked the ‘most relaxed’ (n=18), allowed ‘good use of the legs’ 
 (n=14), involved ‘moderate back flexion’ (n=12), had the ‘load in close’ (n=7) and looked the 
‘most comfortable’ (n=6)  
Discussion 
This is the first study to investigate the perceptions of PTs and MHAs on safe lifting posture.  The 
results of this study show that the majority of PTs (76%) and MHAs (91%) perceive that a straight 
back lifting posture is safer than a more rounded one. However, the results do find a significant 
difference – PTs are 2.5 times more likely than MHAs to choose a more rounded lifting position. 
Those who chose a straight lifting posture justified their choice mainly based on a biomechanical 
description such as the straight posture involving a “neutral spine”, “straight back”, “good 
posture” (51%) or “head posture” (20%). Conversely, the rounded group used more global terms 
to justify their choice; such as these postures looking “efficient” (28%) and “relaxed” or 
“comfortable” (32%). The fact that the rounded postures involved a specific back posture, 
“moderate flexion”, was mentioned less commonly (16%).  Both groups reported their choice 
involved efficient use of the legs (37% straight versus 19% rounded). The straight group report 
keeping the load close as important (34%), whereas it was used much less for justification in the 
rounded group (9%)  
The more biomechanical terms used by those selecting the straight posturescould explain the 
difference in back pain beliefs between groups, as measured by the Back-PAQ.  Those who chose 
a straight lifting posture, justifying it in biomechanical terms, scored higher than those who 
chose a rounded lifting posture, suggesting that their beliefs are associated with greater caution 
about the back.  
There was a significant difference in back beliefs between PTs and MHAs, with MHAs having 
more negative beliefs about the back.  This could be explained by differences in training and 
 continuing professional education.  It has been widely reported in the physiotherapy literature 
that attitudes and beliefs are important in the recovery from an episode of back pain (Linton, 
2000) and that advice to protect the back can be detrimental (Darlow et al., 2013).  This may 
have led to physiotherapists, in the sample we collected, having less cautions beliefs to lifting 
that MHA. However, most physiotherapists still advised people to avoid bending the back when 
lifting so even physiotherapists appear quite  cautious.   
Most PTs and MHAs advise people to avoid rounding the back with lifting, adopting a squat style. 
This appraisal supports that they consider this lift to be the safest, and that this technique is one 
they would teach someone for the prevention or management of LBP. Interestingly, it has been 
shown that those with self-reported disabling LBP already use the squat technique to lift 
(Damkot et al., 1983), and this has been confirmed by kinematic studies that show those with 
LBP lift differently to those that do not; in that they bend the back less, bend the knees more 
and co-contract the muscles around the trunk (Fergauson et al., 2004, Marras et al., 2001, Rudy 
et al., 2003, Slaboda et al., 2008). There is also evidence to suggest that in people with LBP those 
with higher levels of pain-related fear tense their back muscles more and flex their back less 
during forward bending activities (Geisser et al., 2004). This data suggests that people with LBP 
tend to bend and lift in the manner commonly advised by healthcare professionals (straight 
back), as an attempt to avoid stressing painful structures in the back. However, biomechanical 
modelling data suggests that lifting with the back straight and with trunk muscle co-contraction 
in fact results in greater biomechanical loads on the back (Marras et al., 2001).  In contrast, when 
not instructed, pain-free individuals use a more rounded style of lifting (Straker and Duncan, 
2000), which has been shown to be more efficient (Holder, 2013).   
Optimal lifting technique is an area of professional uncertainly.  Some researchers advise the 
avoidance of flexion due to, in part, in vitro studies that show spinal discs are harder to injure 
 when the spine is in a ‘neutral’ position (Gunning et al., 2001).  It has even been speculated that 
the back has a limited number of flexion cycles (Callaghan and McGill, 2001) and that flexion 
should be avoided to spare the spine. However, the transferability of these studies, and their 
related assumptions, have been challenged by in-vivo modelling that has failed to show that 
back posture is a major determent of spinal load (Dreischarf et al., 2016), and studies showing 
that lifting is not independently causative of LBP (Wai et al., 2010).  There is also a lack of clear 
evidence regarding the relationship between injury, tissue damage and back pain (Brinjikji et al., 
2015, Jarvik et la., 2005). Common justifications in both groups for the choice of straight versus 
rounded back lifting posture, were that their choice was the most efficient. However, it has been 
shown that squat lifting (straighter back and deeper knee bend) is less efficient than a more 
rounded style (Holder, 2013).        
Currently there is no in vivo evidence to support the superiority of one lifting technique as being 
safer than another. In spite of this there is an overwhelming belief amongst MHAs and PTs, 
surveyed in this study, that straight back lifting is safer than round back lifting. Interestingly this 
belief was associated with more negative back pain beliefs regarding the vulnerability of the 
back. This belief also contradicts emerging evidence that straight back lifting is less efficient than 
round back lifting and people with LBP should adopt more of a straight back lifting style. There 
is an urgent need to clarify these issues, as advice regarding lifting is central to the ergonomic 
industry and advice to ‘protect’ the back might actually have negative consequences for people 
with LBP (Bunzli et al., 2013). 
Limitations to this study include the electronic nature, and the fact it was advertised on social 
media; this could have biased the sample to those active on the internet.  These views may not 
be fully representative of the professions.  Also, the survey is a snapshot in time, and beliefs may 
 be fluid. Finally, we did not ask if participants’ view of the safest lift would have changed if the 
lift was painful to perform. 
Conclusion 
Most PTs and MHAs, perceive straight back lifting as safest, as it avoids rounding the back. Those 
who preferred a more straight back lifting position were more likely to be MHAs, and to have 
more negative beliefs about the back. Straight lifting positions were praised for the alignment 
of the spine, whereas the rounded postures were praised for their efficiency and comfort. 
Further work is required to evaluate whether lifting advice, and any specific lifting posture, are 
linked to LBP incidence and disability.
