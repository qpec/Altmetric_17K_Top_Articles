SUMMARY
This companion paper to the introduction of the International League Against Epilepsy
(ILAE) 2017 classification of seizure types provides guidance on how to employ the
classification. Illustration of the classification is enacted by tables, a glossary of relevant
terms, mapping of old to new terms, suggested abbreviations, and examples. Basic and
extended versions of the classification are available, depending on the desired degree
of detail. Key signs and symptoms of seizures (semiology) are used as a basis for cate-
gories of seizures that are focal or generalized from onset or with unknown onset. Any
focal seizure can further be optionally characterized by whether awareness is retained
or impaired. Impaired awareness during any segment of the seizure renders it a focal
impaired awareness seizure. Focal seizures are further optionally characterized by
motor onset signs and symptoms: atonic, automatisms, clonic, epileptic spasms, or
hyperkinetic, myoclonic, or tonic activity. Nonmotor-onset seizures can manifest as
autonomic, behavior arrest, cognitive, emotional, or sensory dysfunction. The earliest
prominent manifestation defines the seizure type, which might then progress to other
signs and symptoms. Focal seizures can become bilateral tonic–clonic. Generalized sei-
zures engage bilateral networks from onset. Generalized motor seizure characteristics
comprise atonic, clonic, epileptic spasms, myoclonic, myoclonic–atonic, myoclonic–
tonic–clonic, tonic, or tonic–clonic. Nonmotor (absence) seizures are typical or atypi-
cal, or seizures that present prominent myoclonic activity or eyelid myoclonia. Sei-
zures of unknown onset may have features that can still be classified as motor,
nonmotor, tonic–clonic, epileptic spasms, or behavior arrest. This “users’ manual” for
the ILAE 2017 seizure classification will assist the adoption of the new system.

ILAE COMMISSION REPORT
 Key Points
• The ILAE provided a revised basic and expanded sei-
zure type classification, with initial division into focal
versus generalized onset or unknown onset seizures
• Focal seizures are optionally subdivided into focal
aware and focal impaired awareness seizures. Specific
motor and nonmotor classifiers may be added
• Generalized-onset seizures can be motor: tonic–clo-
nic, clonic, tonic, myoclonic, myoclonic–tonic–clo-
nic, myoclonic–atonic, atonic, and epileptic spasms
• Generalized-onset seizures can also be nonmotor (ab-
sence): typical absence, atypical absence, myoclonic
absence, or absence with eyelid myoclonia
• Additional descriptors and free text are encouraged to
characterize the seizures. Mapping of old to new terms
can facilitate adoption of the new terminology
The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) has
released a 2017 version of seizure-type classification (ac-
companying manuscript). Revision of the classification that
has been used in modified form since 19811 was motivated
by several factors. Some seizure types, for example tonic
seizures or epileptic spasms, can have either a focal or gen-
eralized onset. Lack of knowledge about the onset makes a
seizure unclassifiable. Some terms used to classify seizures
lack community acceptance or public understanding,
including “dyscognitive,” “psychic,” “partial,” “simple par-
tial,” and “complex partial.” Determining whether a person
has impaired consciousness during a seizure can be confus-
ing for nonclinicians. Some important seizure types are not
included in the 1981 classification. The new classification
addresses these relevant issues. Material that follows
explains how to apply the 2017 seizure-type classification.
Methods
Classification of a seizure begins with historical elicita-
tion or observation of certain symptoms and signs (some-
times referred to as the semiology of seizures) that are
known to be associated with common seizures. The key
symptoms and signs cannot be matched in one-to-one rela-
tionships with seizure types because some symptoms appear
in more than one seizure type. Behavior arrest, for example,
occurs in both focal impaired awareness seizures and
absence seizures. Tonic–clonic activity can be present from
onset in a generalized seizure or emerge in the course of a
focal-onset seizure. Conversely, a seizure type often associ-
ates with multiple symptoms. Naming a seizure type an “au-
tomatism seizure” would not allow the distinction between
a focal seizure with impaired awareness and an absence sei-
zure. Because these two seizure types are treated differently
and have different prognoses, maintenance of distinct sei-
zure types is useful, even though some interpretation
beyond direct observation may be needed to classify the sei-
zures. Distinction of seizure types usually can be made by
recognizing a characteristic sequence of symptoms and
other clinical observations. Typical absence seizures, for
instance, show more rapid recovery of function than do
focal impaired awareness seizures. In some instances, ancil-
lary information from electroencephalography (EEG),
imaging, or laboratory studies is needed to properly classify
a seizure. For these cases, classification of seizure type
begins to merge imperceptibly with diagnosis of epilepsy
syndromes.2,3 Because we lack a fundamental pathophysio-
logic understanding of differing seizure presentations,
grouping of symptoms and signs into seizure types reflects
an operational opinion about which groupings are suffi-
ciently distinct and common as to merit a specific name.4
This classification is derived for practical clinical use, but it
also can be used by researchers and other groups with speci-
fic purposes.
Results
The ILAE 2017 seizure classification presents basic and
expanded versions, depending on the desired degree of
detail. The basic version is the same as the expanded ver-
sion, but with collapse of the subcategories.
Basic classification
Figure 1 shows the basic classification. Seizures are first
categorized by type of onset. Focal-onset seizures are
defined as “originating within networks limited to one
hemisphere. They may be discretely localized or more
widely distributed. Focal seizures may originate in subcorti-
cal structures.” Generalized from onset seizures are defined
as “originating at some point within, and rapidly engaging,
bilaterally distributed networks.”5 A seizure of unknown
onset may still evidence certain defining motor (e.g., tonic–
clonic) or nonmotor (e.g., behavior arrest) characteristics.
With further information or future observed seizures, a
reclassification of unknown-onset seizures into focal or gen-
eralized-onset categories may become possible. Therefore,
“unknown-onset” is not a characteristic of the seizure, but a
convenient placeholder for our ignorance. When a seizure
type begins with the words “focal,” “generalized,” or “ab-
sence,” then the word “onset” may be presumed.
Further classification is optional. The next level of focal
seizure classification is by level of awareness. Awareness is
operationally defined as knowledge of self and environ-
ment. Assay of awareness is a pragmatic surrogate marker
used to determine whether level of consciousness is
impaired. During a focal aware seizure, consciousness will
be intact. Awareness specifically refers to awareness during
a seizure, and not to awareness of whether a seizure has

 occurred. If awareness of the event is impaired for any por-
tion of the seizure, then the seizure is classified as a focal
seizure with impaired awareness. As a practical matter, a
focal aware seizure implies the ability of the person having
the seizure to later verify retained awareness. Occasional
seizures may produce transient epileptic amnesia6 with
retained awareness, but classification of such seizures
would require exceptionally clear documentation by obser-
vers. Some might use the shorthand “focal unaware.” In
doing so, it is crucial to note that awareness may be
impaired without being fully absent. Word order is not
important, so “focal aware seizure” means the same thing as
a “focal seizure with retained awareness.”
Responsiveness is a separate clinical attribute that can be
either intact or impaired for seizures with or without
retained awareness. Although responsiveness is an impor-
tant descriptive aspect of seizures, it is not used in the ILAE
2017 classification to designate specific seizure types. The
basic classification further allows classification into motor
onset or nonmotor-onset (for example, sensory) symptoms.
Further specification invokes the expanded classification,
discussed below.
The seizure type “focal to bilateral tonic–clonic” is in a
special category because of its common occurrence and
importance, even though it is reflective of a propagation pat-
tern of seizure activity rather than a unique seizure type.
The phrase “focal to bilateral tonic–clonic” replaces the
older term “secondarily generalized tonic–clonic.” In the
new classification, “bilateral” is used for propagation pat-
terns of seizures and “generalized” for seizures of general-
ized onset.
Generalized-onset seizures are divided into motor and
nonmotor (absence) seizures. Level of awareness is not used
as a classifier for generalized seizures, since the large
majority (although not all) of generalized seizures are asso-
ciated with impaired awareness. By definition of the gener-
alized branch of the classification, motor activity should be
bilateral from the onset, but in the basic classification, the
type of motor activity need not be specified. In cases where
bilateral onset of motor activity is asymmetrical, it may be
difficult in practice to determine whether a seizure has focal
or generalized onset.
Absence seizures (the prefix “generalized onset” may be
assumed) present with a sudden cessation of activity and
awareness. Absence seizures tend to occur in younger age
groups, have more sudden start and termination, and they
usually display less complex automatisms than do focal sei-
zures with impaired awareness, but the distinctions are not
absolute. EEG information may be required for accurate
classification. Focal epileptiform activity may be seen with
focal seizures and bilaterally synchronous spike-waves with
absence seizures.
Seizures of unknown onset can be categorized as motor,
including tonic–clonic, nonmotor, or unclassified. The term
unclassified comprises both seizures with patterns that do
not fit into the other categories or seizures presenting insuf-
ficient information to allow categorization.
Expanded classification
The expanded classification (Fig. 2) provides another
level of seizure names, built on the framework of the basic
classification. The vertical organization of the focal-onset
category is not hierarchical, since naming the level of
awareness is optional. A focal seizure can be classified as
focal aware (corresponding to the 1981 term “simple partial
seizure”) or focal impaired awareness (corresponding to the
1981 term “complex partial seizure”). Focal aware or
impaired awareness seizures can optionally be classified by
adding one of the motor onset or nonmotor-onset terms
below, reflecting the earliest prominent sign or symptom
other than awareness. Alternatively, a focal seizure name
can omit mention of awareness as being inapplicable or
unknown and classify the focal seizure directly by the earli-
est motor or nonmotor characteristic.

ILAE 2017 Seizure Classification Manual
 For focal-onset seizures, the clinician should assay level
of awareness as described for the basic classification. Ask
the patient whether awareness for events occurring during
the seizures was retained or impaired, even when the person
seizing was unresponsive or unable to understand language.
If someone walked into the room during a seizure, would
that person’s presence later be recalled? Questioning wit-
nesses may clarify the nature of behavior during the seizure.
It is important to attempt to distinguish the ictal versus the
postictal state, since awareness returns during the latter. If
the state of awareness is uncertain, as, for example, is usu-
ally the case for atonic or epileptic spasm seizures, the sei-
zure is classified as focal but awareness would not be
specified. Description of level of awareness is optional and
applied only when known. A “focal aware seizure,” with or
without further characterization, corresponds to the old term
“simple partial seizure” and a “focal impaired awareness
seizure” corresponds to the old term “complex partial sei-
zure.” Subsequent terms in the focal column of the
expanded classification can further specify the type of focal
aware and focal impaired awareness seizures. Alternatively,
the degree of awareness can be left unspecified and a seizure
classified as a focal seizure with one of the motor onset or
nonmotor-onset characteristics listed in Figure 2.
Focal motor onset behaviors include these activities: ato-
nic (focal loss of tone), tonic (sustained focal stiffening),
clonic (focal rhythmic jerking), myoclonic (irregular, brief
focal jerking), or epileptic spasms (focal flexion or extension
of arms and flexion of trunk). The distinction between clonic
and myoclonic is somewhat arbitrary, but clonic implies sus-
tained, regularly spaced stereotypical jerks, whereas, myo-
clonus is less regular and in briefer runs. Other less

and

Figure 2.
The expanded ILAE 2017 operational classification of seizure types. The following clarifications should guide the choice of seizure type.
For focal seizures, specification of level of awareness is optional. Retained awareness means the person is aware of self and environment
during the seizure, even if immobile. A focal aware seizure corresponds to the prior term simple partial seizure. A focal impaired aware-
ness seizure corresponds to the prior term complex partial seizure, and impaired awareness during any part of the seizure renders it a
focal impaired awareness seizure. Focal aware or impaired awareness seizures optionally may further be characterized by one of the
motor-onset or nonmotor-onset symptoms below, reflecting the first prominent sign or symptom in the seizure. Seizures should be clas-
sified by the earliest prominent feature, except that a focal behavior arrest seizure is one for which cessation of activity is the dominant
feature throughout the seizure. In addition, a focal seizure name can omit mention of awareness when awareness is not applicable or
unknown, and thereby classify the seizure directly by motor-onset or nonmotor-onset characteristics. Atonic seizures and epileptic
spasms would usually not have specified awareness. Cognitive seizures imply impaired language or other cognitive domains or positive
features such as d�
ej�
a vu, hallucinations, illusions, or perceptual distortions. Emotional seizures involve anxiety, fear, joy, other emotions,
or appearance of affect without subjective emotions. An absence is atypical because of slow onset or termination or significant changes in
tone supported by atypical, slow, generalized spike and wave on the EEG. A seizure may be unclassified due to inadequate information or
inability to place the type in other categories. 1Definitions, other seizure types, and descriptors are listed in the accompanying paper and
glossary of terms. 2Degree of awareness usually is not specified. 3Due to inadequate information or inability to place in other categories.

 automatism is a more or less coordinated, purposeless, repet-
itive motor activity. Observers should be asked whether the
subject demonstrated repetitive purposeless fragments of
behaviors that might appear normal in other circumstances.
Some automatisms overlap other motor behaviors, for
instance, pedaling or hyperkinetic activity, thereby rendering
classification ambiguous. The 2017 ILAE classification arbi-
trarily groups pedaling activity with hyperkinetic seizures,
rather than with automatism seizures. Automatisms may be
seen in focal seizures and in absence seizures.
A focal motor seizure with behavior arrest involves cessa-
tion of movement and unresponsiveness. Because brief
behavioral arrest at the start of many seizures is common
and difficult to identify, a focal behavioral arrest seizure
should comprise behavioral arrest as the predominant aspect
of the entire seizure. Focal autonomic seizures present with
gastrointestinal sensations, a sense of heat or cold, flushing,
piloerection (goosebumps), palpitations, sexual arousal, res-
piratory changes, or other autonomic effects. Focal cogni-
tive seizures can be identified when the patient reports or
exhibits deficits in language, thinking or associated higher
cortical functions during seizures and when these symptoms
outweigh other manifestations of the seizure. D�
ej�
a vu,
jamais vu, hallucinations, illusions, and forced thinking are
examples of induced abnormal cognitive phenomena. A
more correct, although less euphonious, term would be “fo-
cal impaired cognition seizure,” but impaired cognition may
be assumed, since seizures never improve cognitive func-
tion. Focal emotional seizures present with emotional
changes, including fear, anxiety, agitation, anger, paranoia,
pleasure, joy, ecstasy, laughing (gelastic), or crying (dacrys-
tic). Some of these phenomena are subjective and must be
recalled and reported by the patient or caregiver. Emotional
symptoms comprise a subjective component, whereas,
affective signs may or may not be accompanied by subjec-
tive emotionality. Impairment of awareness for events dur-
ing the seizure does not classify the seizure as a focal
cognitive seizure, because impairment of awareness can
apply to any focal seizure. A focal sensory seizure can pro-
duce somatosensory, olfactory, visual, auditory, gustatory,
hot–cold sense, or vestibular sensations.
The clinician must decide whether an event is a unified
single seizure, with evolving manifestations as the seizure
propagates, or alternatively, two separate seizures. Such a
distinction can sometimes be difficult. A smooth, continu-
ous evolutions of signs, symptoms, and EEG patterns
(where available) favors the event being a single seizure.
Repetition of a stereotyped sequence of signs, symptoms,
and EEG changes at different times supports a unitary sei-
zure type. Unitary focal seizures are named for the initial
manifestation and presence or absence of altered conscious-
ness at any point during the seizure. In contrast, discontinu-
ous,
interrupted
or
nonstereotyped
events
point
to
classification of more than one seizure type. Consider an
event
starting
with
d�
ej�
a
vu,
repetitive
purposeless
lip-smacking, loss of awareness, forced version to the right,
and right-arm stiffening. This steady evolution implies a
unitary seizure, which would be classified as a focal
impaired awareness cognitive seizure. It would be useful to
append (as optional description, not a seizure type) informa-
tion about the progression to automatisms and tonic version.
In another scenario, the clinician might encounter a seizure
with fear and loss of awareness. The patient recovers and
30 min later has an event with tingling in the right arm dur-
ing clear awareness. Such a sequence reflects two separate
seizures, the first being a focal impaired awareness emo-
tional seizure and the second a focal aware sensory seizure.
Other focal seizure types are sometimes encountered, for
example, focal tonic–clonic seizures, but not sufficiently
often to be named as a specific seizure type. Rather than
include the term “other” in each category, a decision was
made to revert to nonspecific use of the larger category,
such as motor onset or nonmotor-onset when the next level
of detail is unclear or the seizure is not listed as a specific
seizure type.
The classification of generalized-onset seizures is similar
to that of the 1981 classification, with addition of a few new
types. Awareness usually is impaired with generalized onset
seizures, so level of awareness is not used as a classifier for
these seizures. The main subdivision is into motor and non-
motor (absence) seizure types. The terms “motor” and “non-
motor (absence)” are present in order to allow characteriza-
tion of generalized-onset motor or nonmotor seizures about
which nothing else can be said, but “motor” and “nonmotor
(absence)” may be omitted if the seizure name is unambigu-
ous, for example, “generalized tonic seizure.” The word
“generalized” can be omitted for seizures such as absence
that present only with generalized onset.
Tonic–clonic remains the term replacing the “grand mal”
seizure type, although popular usage of the old French phrase
will undoubtedly persist. Because there is a new seizure type
characterized by myoclonic movements preceding tonic
(stiffening) and clonic (sustained rhythmic jerking) move-
ments, it is important to document the early movements of a
tonic–clonic seizure as being tonic. The clonic phase of a
tonic–clonic seizure typically shows regularly decreasing fre-
quency of jerks over the course of the event. During a tonic–
clonic seizure, awareness is lost before or contempora-
neously with the stiffening and jerking movements. Some
tonic–clonic seizures may invoke a nonspecific feeling of an
impending seizure or a brief period of head or limb version,
neither of which invalidates a generalized onset, since bio-
logic processes never exhibit perfect synchrony. The clini-
cian has to judge whether a truly focal onset is present.
Generalized clonic seizures begin, progress, and end with
sustained rhythmic jerking of limbs on both sides of the
body and often head, neck, face, and trunk. Generalized clo-
nic seizures are much less common than are tonic–clonic
seizures, usually occur in infants, and should be distin-
guished from jitteriness or shuddering attacks.7

ILAE 2017 Seizure Classification Manual
 Generalized tonic seizures manifest as bilateral limb stiff-
ening or elevation, often with neck stiffening. The classifi-
cation presumes that the tonic activity is not followed by
clonic movements. The tonic activity can be a sustained
abnormal posture, either in extension or flexion, sometimes
accompanied by tremor of the extremities. Tonic activity
can be difficult to distinguish from dystonic activity,
defined as sustained contractions of both agonist and antag-
onist muscles producing athetoid or twisting movements,
which when prolonged, may produce abnormal postures.
Generalized myoclonic seizures can occur in isolation or
in conjunction with tonic or atonic activity. Myoclonus dif-
fers from clonus by being briefer and not regularly repeti-
tive. Myoclonus as a symptom has possible epileptic and
nonepileptic etiologies.
Generalized myoclonic–tonic–clonic seizures begin with
a few myoclonic jerks followed by tonic–clonic activity.
These seizures are commonly seen in patients with juvenile
myoclonic epilepsy8 and occasionally with other general-
ized epilepsies. It is arguable whether the initial jerks are
myoclonic or clonic, but they are rarely sufficiently sus-
tained to be considered clonic.
A myoclonic–atonic seizure involves brief jerking of
limbs or trunk, followed by a limp drop. These seizures, pre-
viously called myoclonic–astatic seizures, are most com-
monly
seen in
Doose
syndrome,9 but can
also be
encountered in Lennox-Gastaut and other syndromes.
Atonic means without tone. When leg tone is lost during
a generalized atonic seizure, the patient falls on the buttocks
or sometimes forward onto the knees and face. Recovery is
usually within seconds. In contrast, tonic or tonic–clonic
seizures more typically propel the patient into a backward
fall.
Epileptic spasms previously were referred to as infantile
spasms, and the term “infantile spasms” remains suitable for
epileptic spasms occurring at infantile age. An epileptic
spasm presents as a sudden flexion, extension, or mixed
extension–flexion of predominantly proximal and truncal
muscles. They commonly occur in clusters and most often
during infancy.
Generalized nonmotor seizure types comprise several
varieties of absence seizures. The Task Force retained the
distinction between typical and atypical absence, because
the two types of seizures usually are associated with differ-
ent EEG findings, epilepsy syndromes, therapies, and prog-
noses. According to the 1981 classification, which was
based on analysis of numerous video-EEG recordings,1
absence seizures are considered atypical when they are
associated with changes in tone that are more pronounced
than in typical absence or the onset or cessation is not
abrupt. An EEG may be required to secure the distinction
between typical and atypical absence seizures.
A myoclonic absence seizure10 refers to an absence sei-
zure with rhythmic three-per-second myoclonic move-
ments, causing ratcheting abduction of the upper limbs
leading to progressive arm elevation, and associated with
three-per-second generalized spike-wave discharges. Dura-
tion is typically 10–60 s. Impairment of consciousness may
not be obvious. Myoclonic absence seizures occur in a vari-
ety of genetic conditions and also without known associa-
tions.
Eyelid myoclonia are myoclonic jerks of the eyelids and
upward deviation of the eyes, often precipitated by closing
the eyes or by light. Eyelid myoclonia can be associated
with absences, but also can be motor seizures without a cor-
responding absence, making them difficult to categorize.
The 2017 classification groups them with nonmotor (ab-
sence) seizures, which may seem counterintuitive, but the
myoclonia in this instance is meant to link with absence,
rather than with nonmotor. Absence seizures with eyelid
myoclonia, seizures, or EEG paroxysms induced by eye clo-
sure and photosensitivity constitutes the triad of Jeavons
syndrome.11
Seizures of unknown onset can be motor or nonmotor.
The most important use of this classification is for tonic–
clonic seizures for which the beginning was obscured. Fur-
ther information might allow reclassification as a focal or
generalized-onset seizure. Epileptic spasms and behavior
arrest are other possible seizure types of unknown onset.
Epileptic spasms may require detailed video-EEG monitor-
ing to clarify the nature of onset, but doing so is important
because a focal onset may correspond to a treatable focal
pathology. An unknown-onset behavior arrest seizure could
represent a focal impaired awareness behavior arrest sei-
zure or an absence seizure. A seizure might be unclassified
due to inadequate information or inability to place the sei-
zure in other categories. If an event is not clearly a seizure,
then it should not be called an unclassified seizure; rather,
this classification is reserved for unusual events likely to be
seizures, but not otherwise characterized.
Every seizure classification involves some degree of
uncertainty. The Task Force adopted the general guideline
of an 80% level of certainty that onset was focal or general-
ized; otherwise, the seizure should be listed as of unknown
onset. The 80% level was chosen arbitrarily to match the
commonly applied 80% false-negative cutoff for statistical
analysis.
Common descriptors
Focal seizures provoke a variety of potential sensations
and behaviors too diverse to be incorporated into a classifi-
cation. To facilitate a common terminology about seizures,
the Task Force listed some common descriptors of behav-
iors during focal seizures (Table 1), but these are not intrin-
sic to the classification. In other words, the common
descriptors can be added to the seizure classification to clar-
ify the manifestations of individual seizures, but the descrip-
tors do not define unique seizure types in this classification.
Descriptors are therefore at a “lower level” than are signs,
such as tonic, that define a seizure type. Laterality is a

 special type of descriptor, but an important one in clinical
practice. The Task Force acknowledged the importance of a
detailed individual free-text description of a seizure, in
addition to the classification.
Glossary
Table 2 provides a glossary of terms used in this and the
accompanying paper. The definitions are not universal, but
are focused on the aspects of language pertinent to seizures.
For instance, sensory is defined in terms of sensory seizures,
not all sensation. Wherever possible, prior accepted defini-
tions from the ILAE glossary of 200112 were maintained, in
order to support continuity of usage, but this glossary
updates some terminology. Reference can be made to earlier
literature for definitions of old terms. Terms no longer rec-
ommended for use are omitted.
Mapping old to new terms
Table 3 provides mapping of old official and popular
terms to the 2017 seizure type classification.
Abbreviations
Table 4 provides suggested abbreviations for the main
seizure types.
Summary of rules for classifying seizures
1 Onset: Decide whether seizure onset is focal or gen-
eralized, using an 80% confidence level. Otherwise,
onset is unknown.
2 Awareness: For focal seizures, decide whether to
classify by degree of awareness or to omit awareness
as a classifier. Focal aware seizures correspond to
the old simple partial seizures and focal impaired
awareness seizures to the old complex partial sei-
zures.
3 Impaired awareness at any point: A focal seizure is a
focal impaired awareness seizure if awareness is
impaired at any point during the seizure.
4 Onset predominates: Classify a focal seizure by its
first prominent sign or symptom. Do not count tran-
sient behavior arrest.
5 Behavior arrest: A focal behavior arrest seizure
shows arrest of behavior as the prominent feature of
the entire seizure.
6 Motor/nonmotor: A focal aware or impaired aware-
ness seizure may be further subclassified by motor or
nonmotor characteristics. Alternatively, a focal sei-
zure can be characterized by motor or nonmotor
characteristics, without specifying level of aware-
ness. Example, a focal tonic seizure.
7 Optional terms: Terms such as motor or nonmotor
may be omitted when the seizure type is otherwise
unambiguous.
8 Additional descriptors: After classifying seizure
type based on initial manifestations, it is encour-
aged to add descriptions of other signs and symp-
toms, suggested descriptors or free text. These do
not alter the seizure type. Example: focal emotional
seizure with tonic right arm activity and hyperven-
tilation.
9 Bilateral versus generalized: Use the term “bilateral”
for tonic–clonic seizures that propagate to both hemi-
spheres and “generalized” for seizures that appar-
ently originate simultaneously in both hemispheres.
10 Atypical absence: Absence is atypical if it has slow
onset or offset, marked changes in tone, or EEG
spike-waves at <3 per second.
11 Clonic versus myoclonic: Clonic refers to sustained
rhythmic jerking and myoclonic to regular unsus-
tained jerking.
12 Eyelid myoclonia: Absence with eyelid myoclonia
refers to forced upward jerking of the eyelids during
an absence seizure.

Definition
Source
Absence, typical
A sudden onset, interruption of ongoing activities, a blank stare, possibly a brief upward
deviation of the eyes. Usually the patient will be unresponsive when spoken to. Duration is a
few seconds to half a minute with very rapid recovery. Although not always available, an EEG
would show generalized epileptiform discharges during the event. An absence seizure is by
definition a seizure of generalized onset. The word is not synonymous with a blank stare,
which also can be encountered with focal onset seizures
Adapted from
Ref. 12
Absence, atypical
An absence seizure with changes in tone that are more pronounced than in typical absence or
the onset and/or cessation is not abrupt, often associated with slow, irregular, generalized
spike-wave activity
Adapted from
Ref. 11
Arrest
See behavior arrest
New
Atonic
Sudden loss or diminution of muscle tone without apparent preceding myoclonic or tonic
event lasting ~1–2 s, involving head, trunk, jaw, or limb musculature
12
Automatism
A more or less coordinated motor activity usually occurring when cognition is impaired and
for which the subject is usually (but not always) amnesic afterward. This often resembles a
voluntary movement and may consist of an inappropriate continuation of preictal motor
activity
12
Autonomic seizure
A distinct alteration of autonomic nervous system function involving cardiovascular, pupillary,
gastrointestinal, sudomotor, vasomotor, and thermoregulatory functions
Adapted from
Ref. 12
Aura
A subjective ictal phenomenon that, in a given patient, may precede an observable seizure
(popular usage)
12
Awareness
Knowledge of self or environment
New
Bilateral
Both left and right sides, although manifestations of bilateral seizures may be symmetric or
asymmetric
New
Clonic
Jerking, either symmetric or asymmetric, that is regularly repetitive and involves the same
muscle groups
Adapted from
Ref. 12
Cognitive
Pertaining to thinking and higher cortical functions, such as language, spatial perception,
memory, and praxis. The previous term for similar usage as a seizure type was psychic
New
Consciousness
A state of mind with both subjective and objective aspects, comprising a sense of self as a
unique entity, awareness, responsiveness, and memory
New
Dacrystic
Bursts of crying, which may or may not be associated with sadness
12
Dystonic
Sustained contractions of both agonist and antagonist muscles producing athetoid or twisting
movements, which may produce abnormal postures
Adapted from
Ref. 12
Emotional seizures
Seizures presenting with an emotion or the appearance of having an emotion as an early
prominent feature, such as fear, spontaneous joy or euphoria, laughing (gelastic), or crying
(dacrystic)
New
Epileptic spasms
A sudden flexion, extension, or mixed extension–flexion of predominantly proximal and
truncal muscles that is usually more sustained than a myoclonic movement but not as
sustained as a tonic seizure. Limited forms may occur: Grimacing, head nodding, or subtle eye
movements. Epileptic spasms frequently occur in clusters. Infantile spasms are the best known
form, but spasms can occur at all ages
Adapted from
Ref. 12
Epilepsy
A disease of the brain defined by any of the following conditions: (1) At least two unprovoked
(or reflex) seizures occurring >24 h apart; (2) one unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a
probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk (at least 60%) after two
unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years; (3) diagnosis of an epilepsy
syndrome. Epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals who had an age-dependent
epilepsy syndrome but are now past the applicable age or those who have remained seizure
free for the last 10 years, with no antiseizure medicines for the last 5 years
3
Eyelid myoclonia
Jerking of the eyelids at frequencies of at least 3 per second, commonly with upward eye
deviation, usually lasting <10 s, often precipitated by eye closure. There may or may not be
associated brief loss of awareness
New
Fencer’s posture seizure
A focal motor seizure type with extension of one arm and flexion at the contralateral elbow
and wrist, giving an imitation of swordplay with a foil. This has also been called a
supplementary motor area seizure
New
Figure-of-4 seizure
Upper limbs with extension of the arm (usually contralateral to the epileptogenic zone) with
elbow flexion of the other arm, forming a figure-of-4
New
Focal
Originating within networks limited to one hemisphere. They may be discretely localized or
more widely distributed. Focal seizures may originate in subcortical structures
5
Focal onset bilateral tonic–
clonic seizure
A seizure type with focal onset, with awareness or impaired awareness, either motor or non-
motor, progressing to bilateral tonic–clonic activity. The prior term was seizure with partial
onset with secondary generalization

 Examples
1 Tonic–clonic: A woman awakens to find her husband
having a seizure in bed. The onset is not witnessed, but
she is able to describe bilateral stiffening followed by
bilateral shaking. EEG and magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) findings are normal. This seizure is classified as
unknown onset tonic–clonic. There is no supplementary
information to determine if the onset was focal or gener-
alized. In the old classification, this seizure would have
been unclassifiable with no further qualifiers.
2 Focal onset bilateral tonic–clonic: In an alternate sce-
nario of case 1, the EEG shows a clear right parietal
slow-wave focus. The MRI shows a right parietal region
of cortical dysplasia. In this circumstance, the seizure
can be classified as focal to bilateral tonic–clonic,
despite the absence of an observed onset, because a focal
etiology has been identified, and the overwhelming like-
lihood is that the seizure had a focal onset. The old clas-
sification would have classified this seizure as partial
onset, secondarily generalized.
3 Absence: A child is diagnosed with Lennox-Gastaut
syndrome of unknown etiology. EEG shows runs of
slow spike-waves. Seizure types include absence, tonic,
and focal motor seizures. The absence seizures are pro-
longed, have indistinct onset and cessation, and some-
times result in falls. In this case, the absence seizures are

 classified as atypical absence due to their characteris-
tics, the EEG pattern, and underlying syndrome. The
absence seizures would have had the same classification
in the old system.
4 Tonic: A child has brief seizures with stiffening of the
right arm and leg, during which responsiveness and
awareness are retained. This seizure is a focal aware
tonic seizure (the words “motor onset” can be assumed).
In the old system, the seizure would have been called
tonic, with a perhaps incorrect assumption of general-
ized onset.
5 Focal impaired awareness: A 25-year-old woman
describes seizures beginning with 30 s of an intense
feeling that “familiar music is playing.” She can hear
other people talking, but afterwards realizes that she
could not determine what they were saying. After an epi-
sode, she is mildly confused, and has to “reorient her-
self.” The seizure would be classified as focal impaired
awareness. Even though the patient is able to interact
with her environment, she cannot interpret her environ-
ment, and is mildly confused. Prior classification would
have been complex partial seizure.
6 Autonomic: A 22-year-old man has seizures during
which he remains fully aware, with the “hair on my arms
standing on edge” and a feeling of being flushed. These
are classified as focal aware nonmotor autonomic sei-
zures, or more succinctly, focal aware autonomic sei-
zures. The old classification would have called them
simple partial autonomic seizures.
7 Focal clonic: A 1-month-old boy has rhythmical jerking
of the left arm that does not remit when repositioning the
arm. Corresponding EEG shows right frontal ictal
rhythms. These seizures are focal motor onset clonic sei-
zures, or more parsimoniously, focal clonic seizures.
Because the level of awareness cannot be ascertained,
awareness is not involved in classifying this seizure. The
old classification would not have had a name for this sei-
zure.
8 Sequential seizure manifestations: A seizure begins with
tingling in the right arm of a 75-year-old man. The

 patient says that it then progresses to rhythmic jerking of
the right arm lasting about 30 s. He retains awareness
and memory for the event. This seizure is a focal (non-
motor-onset) sensory seizure. Additional description
would be useful, namely focal sensory seizure with
somatosensory features progressing to right arm clonic
activity. If the sensory and motor events were to be dis-
continuous or the clinician had reason to consider the
event to be two separate (bifocal or multifocal) seizures,
then each component would be classified as a separate
seizure. The old classification would have called this a
simple partial sensorimotor seizure. An advantage of
the 2017 classification is specification of the sensory
onset, which may have clinical importance.
9 Myoclonic–atonic: A 4-year-old boy with Doose syn-
drome has seizures with a few arm jerks and then a rapid
drop with loss of tone. These are now classified as my-
oclonic–atonic seizures. Prior unofficial usage would
have called these myoclonic–astatic seizures.
10 Myoclonic–tonic–clonic seizures: A 13-year-old with
juvenile myoclonic epilepsy has seizures beginning with
a few jerks, followed by stiffening of all limbs and then
rhythmic jerking of all limbs. These would be classified
as myoclonic–tonic–clonic seizures. No corresponding
single seizure type existed in the old classification, but
they might have been called myoclonic or clonic sei-
zures followed by tonic–clonic seizures.
11 Focal epileptic spasms: A 14-month-old girl has sudden
extension of both arms and flexion of the trunk for about
2 s. These seizures repeat in clusters. EEG shows hyp-
sarrhythmia with bilateral spikes, most prominent over
the left parietal region. MRI shows a left parietal dyspla-
sia. Resection of the dysplasia terminated the seizures.
Because of the ancillary information, the seizure type
would be considered to be focal epileptic spasms (the
term “motor onset” can be assumed). The previous clas-
sification would have called them infantile spasms, with
information on focality not included. The term “infan-
tile” can still be used when spasms occur in infancy.
12 Unclassified: A 75-year-old man known to have epi-
lepsy reports an internal sense of body trembling and a
sense of confusion. No other information is available.
EEG and MRI are normal. This event is unclassified.
Discussion
This companion to the paper presenting the rationale and
structure of the ILAE 2017 seizure classification provides
an instructional manual for use of the classification. No
amount of explanation can, however, eliminate the inherent
ambiguities of a classification in real clinical use. For
instance, generalized onset tonic–clonic seizures may be
slightly asymmetrical with initial head version. How focal
must an asymmetry be to imply a focal onset? The answer
lies in individual judgment for each seizure. How uncertain
must a clinician be about the nature of the onset to classify a
seizure as being of unknown onset? The Task Force set a
guideline of “80%” confidence to call a seizure focal or gen-
eralized, but this bright line will undoubtedly blur in prac-
tice.
Ambiguities arise when a seizure presents multiple signs
and symptoms early in the event, for example, tonic arm
stiffening and automatisms. The classifier should choose
the earliest prominent symptom, but different observers
might produce different seizure names depending on the
interpretation of reported or observed symptoms and signs.
These ambiguities can be partially ameliorated by knowing
the typical patterns of common seizures. A behavior arrest,
followed by eye-blinking and head-nodding for 5 s, and then
immediate recovery, is likely to be a typical absence sei-
zure, even though each individual symptom can occur in
multiple seizure types. Appending optional descriptors after
the seizure type may better communicate the nature of a sei-
zure, for example, adding “with laughing” to a “focal
impaired awareness emotional seizure.”
Several motor signs now appear in conjunction with
either focal or generalized-onset seizure types, but it cannot
be assumed that the pathophysiology is the same for both
categories. A focal tonic seizure may have a different mech-
anism than that of a generalized tonic seizure, and each sei-
zure type may evidence different prognoses, responses to
treatments, demographics, and associations with epilepsy
syndromes. Even within the focal category, focal tonic
activity as part of a focal impaired awareness seizure (recall
the common occurrence of twisting movements during com-
plex partial seizures) may be a different entity from focal
tonic seizures in a child with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.
Identifying these new seizure types should facilitate learn-
ing more about them and the syndromes with which they are
associated.
A learning and adoption curve will develop for those in
the epilepsy community who use the 2017 classification.
Over time, consensus will emerge regarding which seizure
types are best representative of various important groups of
symptoms and signs. Past experience forecasts gradual
adoption of the new classification, with transient use of
terms from multiple prior generations of classifications.
Real-world use of the 2017 classification will likely moti-
vate revisions. The desired outcome for the ILAE 2017 clas-
sification is greater ease of communication about seizure
types among clinicians, the nonmedical community, and
researchers. Future empirical classifications will be devel-
oped until knowledge is sufficient to construct a classifica-
tion based on the fundamental reasons that there are
different seizure types.
