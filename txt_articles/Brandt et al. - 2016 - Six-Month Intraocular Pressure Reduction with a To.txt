Purpose:
Improving adherence to manage elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) remains an unmet need. A
topical bimatoprost ocular insert was compared with twice-daily timolol eye drops in patients with open-angle
glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT) treated for 6 months.
Design:
Parallel-arm, multicenter, double-masked, randomized, controlled trial.
Participants:
One hundred thirty adult OAG or OHT patients.
Methods:
Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive a bimatoprost insert plus artificial tears twice daily
or a placebo insert plus timolol (0.5% solution) twice daily for 6 months after a screening washout period. Diurnal
IOP measurements (at 0, 2, and 8 hours) were obtained at baseline; weeks 2, 6, and 12; and months 4, 5, and 6.
Key eligibility included washout IOP of 23 mmHg or more at time 0, IOP of 20 mmHg or more at 2 and 8 hours,
and IOP of 34 mmHg or less at all time points; no prior incisional surgery for OAG or OHT; and no known
nonresponders to prostaglandins.
Main Outcome Measures:
The primary efficacy end point examined the difference in mean change from
baseline in diurnal IOPs (point estimate, 95% confidence interval) across 9 coprimary end points at weeks 2, 6,
and 12 comparing the bimatoprost arm with the timolol arm using a noninferiority margin of 1.5 mmHg. Sec-
ondary end points were diurnal IOP measurements at months 4, 5, and 6 and adverse events (AEs).
Results:
A mean reduction from baseline IOP of �3.2 to �6.4 mmHg was observed for the bimatoprost
group compared with �4.2 to �6.4 mmHg for the timolol group over 6 months. The study met the noninferiority
definition at 2 of 9 time points but was underpowered for the observed treatment effect. Adverse events were
consistent with bimatoprost or timolol exposure; no unexpected ocular AEs were observed. Primary retention rate
of the insert was 88.5% of patients at 6 months.
Conclusions:
Clinically relevant reduction in mean IOP was observed over 6 months with a bimatoprost
ocular insert and seems to be safe and well tolerated. The topically applied bimatoprost insert may provide an
alternative to daily eye drops to improve adherence, consistency of delivery, and reduction of elevated
IOP. Ophthalmology 2016;123:1685-1694 ª 2016 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology. This is an open

Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss
worldwide, and reduction of elevated intraocular pressure
(IOP) is the only proven treatment to slow or halt progres-
sion of the disease1; however, a common problem in disease
management is low patient adherence to ocular medication
administration.2,3
Factors
contributing
to
the
lack
of
compliance include forgetfulness, cost of medications, poor
understanding of glaucoma, difficulty with drop self-
administration, and difficulty with medication schedule.4
Lack of adherence has been shown to correlate with the
progression of vision loss.5 Even in the setting of good
patient adherence, inefficient self-administration of eye
drops (e.g., too many drops instilled or mistargeted drops)
may lead to an extended period of no treatment before
refilling of the prescription. An unmet need exists for
sustained delivery of ocular hypotensive medications to
improve adherence and persistence as an alternative to daily
eye drops in patients with open-angle glaucoma (OAG) or
ocular hypertension (OHT).
We describe a simple and novel sustained-release bima-
toprost ocular insert that is applied topically to the ocular
surface by a physician and allows continuous drug delivery
for up to 6 months per application of the insert. Previous
exploratory, phase I dose-finding safety studies in OAG and
OHT patients whose disease was well controlled with
topical monotherapy demonstrated that the bimatoprost
insert can sustain an IOP reduction of 20% or more (4e6
mmHg) compared with washout baseline IOP for up to 6
months; however, these open-label studies were neither
randomized nor controlled (Goldberg I, et al. Poster P0390,

Congress meeting, 2015). The safety profile was consistent
with bimatoprost exposure (e.g., mild conjunctival hyper-
emia), and the ocular insert seemed to be well tolerated. The
purpose of this study was to assess the relative efficacy and
safety of a bimatoprost insert compared with twice-daily
timolol 0.5% ophthalmic solution in patients with OAG or
OHT treated for 6 months in a multicenter, randomized,
double-masked, randomized, controlled study.
Methods
Study Design
This was a phase II, prospective, randomized, double-masked,
active-controlled, parallel-arm study conducted at 10 sites in the
United States (Appendix 1). The study lasted approximately 7
months and consisted of 2 periods: screening (day �35�7 days
to day 0) and treatment (day 0 to 6 months). A total of 8 study
visits were scheduled: 2 during screening (visits 1 and 2) and 6
during treatment (weeks 2, 6, and 12 and months 4, 5, and 6).
The first patient was enrolled in October 2013 and the last
patient completed the study in November 2014.
The study was conducted in accordance with the International
Conference of Harmonization guidelines (E6) of Good Clinical
Practice and the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and is registered
at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier, NCT01915940). Written informed
consent was obtained before patient enrollment, and the study was
reviewed and approved by an investigational review board.
Investigational Ocular Inserts
Description. The bimatoprost insert is a preservative-free ocular
ring containing 13 mg bimatoprost mixed into a silicone matrix
placed over an inner polypropylene support structure and is man-
ufactured in diameters ranging from 24 to 29 mm (Fig 1). Drug
release is based on passive, concentration gradientedriven mo-
lecular diffusion of the drugs through the silicone matrix into the
tear film. The release rate of bimatoprost into the tear film is
determined by the physical properties of the silicone, the surface
area of the siliconeedrug matrix, and the concentration of the
bimatoprost in the siliconeedrug matrix. The elution profile of the
bimatoprost insert is a continuous monotonically declining dose
that elutes a higher dose of bimatoprost at day 0 (day of insertion)
than at day 180 (day of removal). Over the range of 6 months (180
days), the bimatoprost insert elutes a descending dose of
bimatoprost of approximately 35 mg/day at day 0 to 6 mg/day at day
180, and a total dose of approximately 2.5 mg bimatoprost (data on
file). By comparison, topical bimatoprost 0.03% (Lumigan;
Allergan, Inc, Irvine, CA.) is approved as a once-daily eye drop
with a concentration of approximately 9 mg/day (total dose,
approximately 1.6 mg over 180 days). Bimatoprost was selected as
the active drug product for this program based on manufactur-
ability and efficacy of the drop formulation; formulation testing
supports that travoprost or latanoprost also can be incorporated into
the silicone matrix without difficulty.
Method of Placement. To provide a custom fit, the investigator
measured the intercanthal distance to select the appropriate diameter
insert. After administration of an optional drop of anesthetic agent,
the investigator gently manually retracted the eyelids and placed the
ocular insert in the upper and lower fornices (Fig 2). A scleral
depressor was used at the discretion of the physician (Video 1,
available at www.aaojournal.org).
Method of Removal. The ocular insert is removed by gentle
manually retracting the lower eyelid, allowing exposure of the
bottom portion of the ocular insert. The exposed ring then is
grasped with the fingers and pulled from the upper fornix.
Study Protocol
Screening and Eligibility. At visit 1 (day �35�7 days), after
obtaining
informed
consent,
data
were
collected
by
study
personnel; these included demographic data, medical and medi-
cation history, and inclusion and exclusion evaluation. A summary
of the study schema and visits is provided in Figure 3. Inclusion
criteria included a diagnosis of either OAG or OHT controlled
with monotherapy with IOP-lowering topical medication, or, if
not medicated, likely to be controlled with monotherapy; ability to
discontinue ocular hypotensive treatment for the required washout
period of 4 to 6 weeks; best-corrected visual acuity equivalent to
20/80 or better in both eyes; stable visual fields in the opinion of
the investigator; and corneal thickness between 490 and 620 mm.
Exclusion criteria included known nonresponders or any contra-
indication to prostaglandin analogs (PGAs) or timolol, current
treatment for glaucoma with fixed-combination medications or oral
drug, use of intravitreal or peribulbar injection of depot steroid or
placement of an intravitreal steroid implant within the 6 months
before the screening date, cup-to-disc ratio of more than 0.8, severe
central visual field loss with a sensitivity of 10 dB or less in 2 or
more of the 4 points closest to the point of fixation, history of any
incisional surgery for glaucoma or corneal refractive surgery, pa-
tients who required contact lens use during the study period, and
patients with current punctal occlusion.
Participants meeting all eligibility criteria at visit 1 were fitted
with an open-label nonmedicated (placebo) ocular insert in both
eyes that was worn during the entire screening washout period to
assess comfort and proper fitting of the insert before consideration
for investigational treatment. At visit 2, screening procedures were
repeated. Qualifying patients had to demonstrate the following IOP
requirements: mean IOP for each eye of 23 mmHg or more and 34
mmHg or less at 0 hours, 20 mmHg or more and 34 mmHg or less
at 2 hours, and 20 mmHg or more and 34 mmHg or less at 8 hours;
and intereye IOP difference of 5.0 mmHg or less at the 0-, 2-, and
8-hour measurements. After removal of the placebo inserts, eligible
patients were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio: a
bimatoprost insert in both eyes plus daily unpreserved artificial
tears twice daily (morning and evening; Refresh Classic; Allergan,
Inc.) or a placebo insert in both eyes plus daily unpreserved timolol
0.5% ophthalmic solution twice daily (morning and evening;
Valeant Ophthalmics, Bridgewater, NJ). Use of artificial tears was
required for patients assigned to the bimatoprost insert to preserve
masking (double-dummy design).

 Participants returned to the study sites for diurnal IOP mea-
surements (0, 2, and 8 hours) at weeks 2, 6, and 12 and at months
4, 5, and 6. After the 0-hour IOP measurement, patients were
instructed to self-administer their assigned morning dose of the
study eye drop so that 100% adherence to eye drop medication was
achieved at the 2- and 8-hour measurements.
Study
Masking. The
treating
physician,
study
and
site
personnel, and participants were masked to treatment assignment.
The ocular inserts were identical, and the topical eye drops were in
similar unmarked unit dose vials. Participants were randomized
and assigned study kits through a web-based electronic data cap-
ture system. An unmasked independent statistician generated the
patient randomization and randomized kit lists.
The nonmedicated placebo insert is identical (in physical form
and color) to the bimatoprost insert, except that it contains no
active drug. The artificial tears (buffered saline with polyvinyl
alcohol 1.4% and povidone 0.6%) and timolol 0.5% ophthalmic
solution were packaged in similar low-density polypropylene
unpreserved unit doses with no identifiable markings on the am-
pules. Open-label use of artificial tears, as needed, was allowed for
all patients during the screening and washout period.
Rescue Treatment. Rescue therapy with topical bimatoprost
(Lumigan 0.01% bimatoprost ophthalmic solution; Allergan, Inc.)
in one or both eyes was allowed by the study investigator for any
patient with IOP meeting the following criteria at 2 consecutive
visits at least 1 week apart: mean IOP more than 25 mmHg in one
or both eyes at any time point on a visit day and mean IOP
reduction less than 10% in one or both eyes at the same time point
on a visit day compared with the IOP at the time of randomization.
Outcome Measures
Efficacy. The primary efficacy measure was mean IOP reduction
from baseline measured with Goldmann applanation tonometry at
0, 2, and 8 hours at weeks 2, 6, and 12. The primary efficacy end
point was the difference between the mean change in IOP for the
bimatoprost insert group and the mean change in IOP for the
timolol treatment group as measured from baseline (day 0) at each
of the diurnal time points within the first 12 weeks.
Safety. Safety measures included adverse events (AEs), bio-
microscopy, funduscopy, visual acuity, and visual fields. Slit-lamp
biomicroscopic observations for conjunctival hyperemia and eye
discharge (mucus) were graded on a numerical scale from 0 to 3:
0 ¼ none, 0.5 ¼ trace, 1 ¼ mild, 2 ¼ moderate, and 3 ¼ severe. A
2-step change from baseline was considered an ocular AE for
conjunctival hyperemia or eye discharge. All AEs were classified
according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities
version 16.0 (MedDRA MSSO, McLean, VA).
Participants were instructed on the care and maintenance of the
ocular insert after placement by the investigator that included care
when rubbing the eyes and instructions on how to retract the eyelid
manually and reinsert a partially dislodged insert. For fully dis-
lodged inserts, the participants were instructed not to reinsert the
insert at home; instead, they were required to return to the clinical
site for placement of a new insert.
Statistical Analysis
The primary efficacy end point consisted of mean change in IOP
averaged over both eyes that was modeled using a repeated-mea-
sures analysis of covariance model with fixed effect terms for
treatment group, visit, IOP at randomization, and the interaction of
treatment by visit. The 0-, 2-, and 8-hour measures were assessed
across visits using separate repeated-measures analysis of covari-
ance models. The mean change in IOP for each group, the differ-
ence between the mean changes of the 2 arms (bimatoprost insert
group minus timolol group), and their 2-sided 95% confidence
interval (CI) was calculated using separate linear contrasts for
weeks 2, 6, and 12. The hypothesis tested in the primary analysis at
each of the 9 coprimary time points was based on the upper limit of
the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in the mean IOP between the
2 treatment groups at each of the 9 time points based on the
following: H0: mNt � mXt � 1.5 mmHg and Ha: mNt � mXt < 1.5
mmHg, where mNt and mXt are the mean changes in IOP for the
bimatoprost insert group and the timolol group, respectively. The
noninferiority hypothesis was tested at each of the 3 diurnal time
points at weeks 2, 6, and 12. The bimatoprost insert treatment
regimen is declared noninferior to the timolol treatment regimen if
the upper limit of the 95% CI is less than 1.5 mmHg for all 9
coprimary time points.
Efficacy Analysis Population. The primary population for the
test of the primary efficacy hypotheses was the full analysis set.
The full analysis set included all randomized patients who
completed at least 1 on-treatment study visit. The analysis of the
primary efficacy outcome and the secondary efficacy outcomes was
performed on the full analysis set according to the randomized
treatment assignment. Sensitivity analyses included per protocol
and worse eye. In the per-protocol analysis, the data from any

original insert was replaced.
Safety Analysis Population. The safety population comprised
all randomized patients who had a masked ocular insert placed in
their eyes. The principal safety analyses were performed according
to the actual treatment each patient received.
Sample Size Considerations. The sample size was based on the
following assumptions: a standard deviation of 3.5 mmHg in the
change in IOP for patients in each treatment group, a 1:1
randomization, a noninferiority margin of 1.5 mmHg, a treatment
difference under the null hypothesis of �0.5 mmHg (e.g., the
bimatoprost insert is better than timolol drops by 0.5 mmHg), a
1-sided type 1 error rate (a) of 0.025, and a dropout rate of slightly
less than 20% at 12 weeks. A sample size of approximately 63
randomized (50 evaluable) patients in each group provided 81%
power for testing the hypothesis based on these assumptions.
Results
Patient Disposition and Demographics
One hundred sixty-nine patients were screened and 130 patients
were randomized (Table 1) to receive the 13-mg bimatoprost insert
(n ¼ 64) or timolol (n ¼ 66). Of the 169 screened patients, 151
(89.3%) had no comfort issues with the nonmedicated insert. A
total of 115 patients (88.5%) completed the study at month 6
(82.8% [n ¼ 53] and 93.9% [n ¼ 62] for the bimatoprost insert and
timolol groups, respectively). The overall demographic character-
istics were well balanced between groups with respect to age,
gender, glaucoma status, central corneal thickness, and IOP at
baseline; there was a slight racial imbalance, with fewer white
patients in the bimatoprost group (67.2%) compared with the
timolol group (80.3%; Table 2). No patients received rescue
treatment during the study.
Intraocular PressureeLowering Efficacy
Participants receiving either a bimatoprost insert or daily timolol
had clinically relevant sustained reductions in IOP compared with
baseline (Table 3; Fig 4) over the 6-month study period. However,
daily timolol 0.5% ophthalmic solution provided approximately
0 to 1.5 mmHg more IOP reduction compared with the bimatoprost
insert.
For the primary efficacy analysis, the point estimates of the
mean difference in the IOP measurements between the 2 groups
were less than 1.5 mmHg at all 9 time points; however, because the
upper boundary of the 95% CI exceeded the 1.5 mmHg non-
inferiority margin at 7 of 9 time points within the first 12 weeks,
the bimatoprost insert did not meet the protocol definition of
noninferiority to timolol (Fig 5). The sensitivity analyses, including
the per-protocol analysis, were consistent with the primary efficacy
analysis.
Retention
The primary retention rate of the ocular inserts, defined as main-
tenance of the insert in situ without requiring physician reinter-
vention, was 93.1% at 12 weeks and 88.5% at 6 months overall for
the combined treatment group (bimatoprost insert and placebo
insert). The retention rates were similar across treatment groups:
the primary retention rate at 12 weeks and 6 months was 90.6%
and 87.5% for the bimatoprost group, and 93.9% and 90.9% for the
placebo group of participants in both eyes. A total of 28 dis-
lodgements were reported in 15 patients. The proportion of dis-
lodgements was higher among men (20.8%) than women (5.2%);
no other demographic trends were observed. The dislodgements
were distributed relatively evenly between study days 2 and 180
after randomization. Nine patients experienced a single dislodge-
ment; 3 patients had 2 dislodgements; 2 patients had 3 instances of
dislodgement; and 1 patient experienced 7 dislodgements. Patients
who had fully displaced inserts received new inserts, allowing for
continuous maintenance of days on therapy. There were no cases of
a lost or missing ocular insert; all inserts were fully accounted for
by the investigators.
Safety
The bimatoprost insert seemed to be safe and well tolerated, and
the overall safety profile was consistent with either bimatoprost or
timolol exposure. The bimatoprost insert group had a higher per-
centage of ocular (bimatoprost, 45.3%; timolol, 34.8%) and non-
ocular (bimatoprost, 26.6%; timolol, 24.2%) treatment-emergent

 AEs than the timolol group. Most ocular AEs were mild to mod-
erate in severity and resolved without sequelae.
The most common (�5%) treatment-emergent AEs occurring in
either treatment group, regardless of causality, are summarized in
Table 4. The ocular AE of eye discharge (mucus) was reasonably
balanced across both groups and presumably is the result of
mechanical stimulation of the conjunctival goblet cells from the
physical presence of the insert on the ocular surface.
There was 1 protocol-specified serious ocular AE of blurred
vision resulting in 3-line or more loss in visual acuity in a patient
assigned to the timolol group. The event was transient, resolved
fully with no sequelae, and was reported as not being drug related.
Four patients (2 in each treatment group) experienced nonocular
serious AEs; none were reported as drug related and all resolved
fully. These include a fall resulting in cellulitis and vascular hy-
pertension in the bimatoprost group and drug hypersensitivity
(opioid allergic reaction) and atrial fibrillation in the timolol group.
The other ocular safety parameters (best-corrected visual acuity,
slit-lamp biomicroscopy results, dilated funduscopy results) were
comparable between groups with the exception of higher slit-lamp-
determined rates of conjunctival hyperemia in the bimatoprost
group compared with the timolol group.
A total of 10 patients withdrew from the study because of
treatment-emergent AEs, 9 of whom were assigned to the bima-
toprost group and 1 of whom was assigned to the timolol group
(Table 5). This rate of imbalance between the bimatoprost and
timolol
groups
was
similar
to
prior
registration
studies
comparing the 2 agents.6 All of the AEs resolved with no
sequelae.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the
proof of concept that sustained reduction in IOP can be
achieved nonsurgically with a topically applied drug-
delivery system in patients for 6 months. Persistence and
adherence with daily-administered IOP-lowering eye drops
remains a significant issue for physicians managing patients
with OAG and OHT.2,3 To address the unmet medical need,
we designed a simple, noninvasive, preservative-free, drug-
eluting ocular insert that can be applied topically to the
ocular surface by an eye care specialist and can elute

� 6-Month IOP Reduction with Bimatoprost Insert
1689
 medication for up to 6 months. The intent of the insert is to
provide patients and eye care specialists an alternative to
daily eye drops or incisional surgery in patients with un-
complicated OAG or OHT whose disease can be controlled
with monotherapy.
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate
whether sustained reduction in IOP can be achieved with a
bimatoprost insert compared with twice-daily timolol 0.5%
ophthalmic solution in a population of OAG and OHT pa-
tients. The results demonstrated that a clinically relevant
sustained reduction in IOP of approximately 4 to 6 mmHg
(�20% reduction compared with washout baseline) for 6
months can be achieved with the bimatoprost insert, with no
patients receiving rescue therapy. In OHT patients observed
in the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study, a 20%
lowering of IOP reduced the conversion rate to OAG by
half.7
The overall primary ocular retention rate was high at
93.1% and 88.5% of patients at 3 and 6 months, respec-
tively. The comfort profile was acceptable in nearly 90% of
patients during the initial screening and washout period
using a nonmedicated insert; those participants who expe-
rienced insert-related discomfort typically elected to dis-
continue within the first few days of wear. The bimatoprost
insert seems to be safe, with an AE and tolerability profile
similar to that of bimatoprost 0.03% ophthalmic solution
(e.g., mild to moderate conjunctival hyperemia and ocular
pruritus).6,8 All participants in whom an insert dislodged
fully were aware of the dislodgement and returned promptly
to the clinic for a new insert and therapy continuation.
The observation that the IOP-lowering profile of the
bimatoprost insert is slightly less effective relative to the
predicted IOP reduction of a once-daily administered 0.01%
or 0.03% bimatoprost drop is not wholly unexpected.
Prostaglandin analogs have a known U-shaped dosing fre-
quency response curvedthat is, there is less effective IOP

 available in the United States.9e11 This atypical dose
response of PGAs was reported first with latanoprost in
1998, for which receptor subsensitivity was proposed;
however, the exact mechanism remains poorly under-
stood.12 The paradoxical IOP-lowering PGA effect relative
to timolol also has been observed in emerging clinical data
using drug-eluting punctal plugs delivering either latano-
prost13 or travoprost.14 Attempts to overcome this atypical
pharmacodynamic
profile
have
led
to
alternative
investigational
approaches
through
direct
intracameral
injection of sustained-release PGAs (Lewis RA, et al. Pos-
ter P00093, American Academy of Ophthalmology annual
meeting, 2015). The intracameral route potentially allows
for lower drug loads and elution rates compared with topical
approaches that require higher drug loading to drive passive
diffusion of the active molecule across the cornea. However,
it is likely that regardless of approach (e.g., intracameral,
punctal plug, ocular inserts), all sustained-release platforms
using PGAs will have similar long-term efficacy profiles
because of the clinical observation of agonist desensitiza-
tion.12 To address this, we will be exploring the feasibility
of ocular inserts containing fixed combinations of drugs as
a means to improve further IOP lowering.
Although the bimatoprost insert was not noninferior to
daily timolol eye drops in this study, the point estimate of
the mean difference in IOP between the bimatoprost insert
and timolol was less than the 1.5-mmHg noninferiority
margin at all diurnal time points within the first 12 weeks.
Because the CI is influenced by the sample size, it is
anticipated that in a larger, adequately powered phase III
study of similar design the noninferiority margin would be
met in most time points for the traditional IOP assessments
within the first 12 weeks. Regardless, the intent of the ocular
insert is to provide consistent pharmacologic treatment for
patients who otherwise would not be taking any medication
because of poor adherence, and a 20% or more reduction

� 6-Month IOP Reduction with Bimatoprost Insert
1691
 with consistent IOP control may be sufficient in many
patients with uncomplicated OAG or OHT. Whether daily-
administered artificial tears influenced the efficacy profile
of the bimatoprost insert is not known. Given the short
residence time of artificial tears on the ocular surface, we do
not believe this was a confounding factor; however, long-
term safety studies are being conducted without concomi-
tant artificial tears (for up to 13 months) to help provide
additional information.
It is unlikely that the results of our study were the
consequence of insufficient drug loads delivered to the
ocular surface. The total drug dose delivered by the bima-
toprost insert is higher than the total dose delivered by once-
daily drops of a 0.03% bimatoprost ophthalmic solution
over a 6-month period; therefore, daily administration of
0.01% or 0.03% bimatoprost ophthalmic solution delivers
approximately 3 to 9 mg/day, whereas the bimatoprost insert
elutes a steadily declining dose of bimatoprost ranging from
approximately 35 mg/day to 6 mg/day at 6 months based on
in vitro assays. The day-to-day variance of drug concen-
tration in the tear film in vivo has not yet been investigated.
There is no evidence of bimatoprost accumulation in the
systemic circulation when wearing the bimatoprost inserts in
both eyes; plasma concentrations of bimatoprost are less
than concentrations of detection after 7 days (lower limit of
quantitation, 0.0250 ng/ml; data on file).
The bimatoprost insert seems to be safe and well toler-
ated. The most frequently reported AEs were within ex-
pectations for either bimatoprost or timolol drug exposure,
and there were no unanticipated ocular AEs. The observed
conjunctival hyperemia rates with the bimatoprost insert
(14.1%) are lower than with topical bimatoprost ophthalmic
solution (25%e45%).9 There were no reported cases of
localized hyperemia (i.e., ring-like hyperemic circles on
the ocular surface in patients receiving the bimatoprost
insert), local conjunctival changes (e.g., granulomatous
inflammation), localized infection, or drug-related serious
AEs. The most frequently reported ocular AE of eye
discharge (i.e., mucus) was relatively balanced across both
study arms and is consistent with earlier clinical studies
using the ocular insert (Goldberg I. Poster P0390, American
Academy of Ophthalmology annual meeting, 2014; Gold-
berg I. Poster P-S-094, World Glaucoma Congress meeting,
2015). Typically, the mucus was noted on waking as a small
quantity of crusting in the canthal region; no special treat-
ment was required. We speculate that the conjunctival sur-
face in direct contact with the insert may stimulate goblet
cells to produce additional mucin during normal lid motion.
The proportion of patients discontinuing study participation
through 6 months of treatment because of ocular AEs in the
bimatoprost group (14.1%) was similar to published rates
observed in pooled phase III registrational studies of 0.03%
bimatoprost ophthalmic solution (14.5%) versus timolol.8
The overall bilateral primary retention rate of the ocular
inserts of nearly 90% of patients at 6 months represents a
significant advance in the evolution of sustained-release
ocular inserts. The reason for the disproportionately higher
rate of dislodgement in men (20.8%) compared with women
(5.2%) observed in this study is unclear, and ongoing long-
term studies will help to clarify whether true gender-related
factors exist. Participants were aware of all insert dis-
lodgements and returned promptly to the physician to have a
new insert placed so that treatment continued. In 1974, the
Food and Drug Administration approved an ocular insert
(Ocusert; Alza, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) consisting of a reservoir
containing a pilocarpine solution that eluted drug through a
semipermeable membrane and provided treatment for up to
7 days.15 The insert was inserted in the lower lid cul-de-sac,
but the insert was not widely used in practice because of its
high rates of dislodgement, patient discomfort, short elution
period, and side effects associated with pilocarpine; the
product was eventually removed from the United States
market by the manufacturer.16
The simplicity, comfort, and high retention rate of the
bimatoprost insert may have broader drug-delivery appli-
cations beyond monotherapy for OAG and OHT. The large
surface area of the inserts allows loading of a combination
of
ocular
hypotensive
agents
(e.g.,
bimatoprost
plus
timolol). Other applications of a so-called dropless delivery
platform of the ocular insert include pharmacologic thera-
pies for dry eye disease, ocular allergy, and postoperative
inflammation, all of which are under development. Addi-
tional studies to characterize further the performance,
durability, and safety profile of the bimatoprost insert
include a formal dose-ranging study evaluating a 2.2-mg
and 13-mg bimatoprost insert followed by a 9-month
open-label safety study; other studies under consideration
include nocturnal IOP evaluation, impression cytologic
analysis to evaluate the conjunctival surface, and corneal
specular endothelial microscopy.
Limitations of this study include the double-dummy
design (masked investigational insert and a masked inves-
tigational eye drop) in which all study participants con-
sented and agreed to be fully adherent to a daily regimen of
either twice-daily artificial tears or timolol 0.5% ophthalmic
solution, whereas the intent of the insert is to help patients
who are nonadherent with a daily regimen of eye drops.
However, a regimented dosing schedule requiring high pa-
tient compliance is required for all Food and Drug
Administration registrational studies for which a comparison
with eye drops is used as a control. A real-world long-term
observational registry can be accomplished only after the
product is approved and available to physicians and patients.
With respect to the control eye drops, for the past 2 decades
the regulatory benchmark for approval of new glaucoma
agents in the United States has been comparison with twice-
daily administered 0.5% timolol drops. At this time, there is
no precedent (or requirement) for approval of a sustained-
release product based on head-to-head comparison with a
PGA drop. Future studies comparing the bimatoprost insert
with topically administered bimatoprost drops are antici-
pated. The second limitation is that the insertion of a new
medicated insert at 6 months was not evaluated, nor was a
shorter 3-month cycle explored. Patients completing this
study were eligible to participate in an open-label single-arm
bimatoprost insert safety study for 13 months of additional
treatment (2 cycles: first a 7-month cycle followed by a
6-month cycle), and the study is ongoing. A 6-month dosing
profile

engineered

feedback

 be seen every 6 months and OAG patients to be monitored
every 3 months. Finally, longer-term studies of a high-risk
(low-adherence) population will be required to demon-
strate the full usefulness of our ocular drug-delivery system
in preserving visual fields, but such studies will require
several years of follow-up and currently are not feasible at
this stage of development.
In conclusion, a randomized clinical phase II trial using a
novel bimatoprost ocular insert demonstrated that a clinically
relevant reduction in IOP (4e6 mmHg) can be achieved and
sustained for 6 months. The bimatoprost insert seems to be
safe and well tolerated, with excellent primary retention rates.
Larger confirmatory phase III studies are planned.

Pictures & Perspectives
Bilateral Isolated Optic Nerve Colobomatous Cysts
A 3-year-old boy, with normal developmental milestones,
presented with diminution of vision in both eyes. The visual
acuity was 20/100 and 20/200 in right and left eye respec-
tively. The child had bilateral high myopia (�12.25 SE) with
V-pattern exotropia. Fundus examination showed optic disc
excavation with peripapillary atrophy in both eyes (A, B).
Magnetic resonance imaging showed well circumscribed,
nonenhancing cystic lesions in the proximal portion of both
the optic nerves, as seen on T1 and T2-weighted axial (C, D),
coronal and sagittal (E, F) scans, with no associated anoma-
lies (C-F, arrows indicate the positions of the anomaly).
A diagnosis of bilateral isolated colobomatous optic nerve
cysts was made.
