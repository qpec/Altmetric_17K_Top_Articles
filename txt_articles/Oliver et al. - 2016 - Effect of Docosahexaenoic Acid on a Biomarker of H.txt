Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 48, No. 6, pp. 974–982, 2016. Purpose: American football athletes are exposed to subconcussive impacts over
the course of the season resulting in elevations in serum neurofilament light (NFL), a biomarker of axonal injury. Docosahexaenoic
acid (DHA) has been reported to reduce axonal trauma associated with traumatic brain injury in rodent models. However, the optimal dose
in American football athletes is unknown. This study examined the effect of differing doses of DHA on serum NFL over the course of a
season of American football. Methods: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design, 81 National Collegiate
Athletic Association Division I American football athletes were assigned to ingest either 2, 4, 6 gIdj1 of DHA or placebo. Blood was
sampled at specific times over the course of 189 d, coincident with changes in intensity, hours of contact, and likely changes in head
impacts. Standardized magnitude-based inference was used to define outcomes. Results: DHA supplementation increased plasma DHA in a
dose-dependent manner (2 gIdj1: mean difference from baseline; T90% CL; 2 gIdj1: 1.3; T0.6; 4 gIdj1: 1.6; T0.7%; 6 gIdj1: 2.8; T1.2%).
Serum NFL increased to a greater extent in starters (area under the curve, 1995 T 1383 pgImLj1) versus nonstarters (1398 T 581 pgImLj1;
P = 0.024). Irrespective of dose, supplemental DHA likely attenuated serum NFL coincident with increases in serum NFL by likely small
and moderate magnitude (effect size = 0.4–0.7). Conclusions: Findings from this study, the first large-scale study examining potential
prophylactic use of DHA in American football athletes, include identification of optimal dose of DHA, suggesting a neuroprotective effect of
DHA supplementation. Key Words: CONCUSSION, HEAD TRAUMA, NEUROFILAMENT LIGHT, DHA
A
merican football is associated with the highest inci-
dence of concussion (11), often used interchangeably
with the term mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI),
among team sports (13). This is not surprising, given that
during play, American football athletes are routinely exposed
to head impacts, which result in head rotational acceleration/
deceleration forces (inertial loading) and propagation of force
through the brain (10). These mechanical forces are known to
result in acceleration and deceleration forces on neurons,
supporting cells and their projecting fibers, as well as intra-
cellular injury, which leads to diffuse axonal injury (1,8), a
characteristic feature of mTBI. Using magnetic resonance
imaging in conjunction with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI),
Davenport et al. (12) demonstrated that a single season of
American high school football resulted in changes in mag-
netic resonance imaging indicative of axonal injury in the
absence of a concussion diagnosis.
Neurofilaments are abundant in key intermediate fibers
in neurons and major components of the axonal skeleton
(15). Though the exact mechanism of release and subsequent
appearance of neurofilament light (NFL) in biological fluids
is not known, what is known is that significant changes oc-
cur in neurofilaments as a result of diffuse axonal injury as
evidenced in animal models of traumatic brain injury (TBI)
(for a review, see Sciiedler et al. (33)). Interestingly, eleva-
tions in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) NFL protein have been
reported in boxers sustaining concussive or subconcussive
head impacts (26,39). The utility of NFL as a marker of axonal
damage in humans is further supported by studies in which

 elevations are reported in the CSF and plasma of those patients
suffering from neurodegenerative and neuroinflammation
diseases (17,18). Further, a strong correlation has recently
been reported between CSF and plasma NFL (18). Like box-
ing, the sport of American football is physical in nature,
resulting in exposure to subconcussive head impacts that vary
in magnitude and number over the course of a season,
irrespective of level of play (7,10), which have been reported
to result in neurophysiological changes (34). Detection of a
biomarker, such as NFL, would thus be of significance,
given that in the absence of reporting or characteristic dis-
play of symptoms, an athlete may play before full recovery,
which may further subject the athlete to injury and increase
the likelihood of damage to the brain (30).
In their recent position statement, the American Medical
Society for Sports Medicine suggested that protective equip-
ment does not reduce the incidence and/or severity of con-
cussion in sport (19) despite advancements (37), highlighting
the need for different approaches to prevent brain damage.
Nutritional supplementation, specifically docosahexaenoic
acid (DHA) (22:6n-3), the principal n-3 long-chain poly-
unsaturated fatty acid in brain tissue (21) has received con-
siderable attention as a possible intervention to mitigate
pathology associated with mTBI. Prior investigation of TBI
in animal models has demonstrated that supplemental DHA
attenuates axonal damage when administered before insult
(6,32). The typical American diet is scarce in both DHA and
the n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid eicosapentaenoic
acid (EPA, 20:5n-3), with an estimated combined intake of
about 100 mgIdj1 (14). Although it is known that supple-
mental DHA results in an increase in plasma DHA in a dose-
dependent manner up to approximately 2 gIdj1 which
approaches saturation in the average population (5), American
football athletes are larger than the average population, and
most athletes (38) participate in heavy physical training, which
is known to affect fatty acid composition (28). Therefore,
larger doses may be necessary.
This study sought to examine changes in serum NFL over
the course of the season in American football athletes. We
hypothesized that an increase in NFL would occur after
those times in which the number and magnitude of impacts
increased. Further, given reports of supplemental DHA re-
ducing axonal injury in rodent models of TBI (6,32), we
sought to examine the effect of differing doses of supple-
mental DHA on serum NFL over the course of a season in
American football athletes. We hypothesized that American
football athletes would require higher doses of supplemental
DHA due to their larger size and physical activity and that
supplemental DHA would attenuate any increase in serum
NFL observed over the course of the season.
METHODS
Subjects. This study was conducted according to the
Declaration of Helsinki guidelines. All procedures involving
human subjects were approved by the institutional review
board of Texas Christian University for use of human sub-
jects in research (protocol no. 1404-68-1404). Written con-
sent was obtained from all subjects.
All athlete volunteers were National Collegiate Athletic
Association (NCAA) Division I American football athletes
cleared to participate in university athletics as determined by
the team physician. Exclusion criteria included chronic daily
anti-inflammatory (Q20 d) or antihypertensive medication
use, medications for blood lipids, fish oil or omega-3 fatty
acid supplementation, and consumption of more than two
servings of fish per week. Athletes injured or unable to
participate in regularly schedule conditioning or competi-
tions were also excluded. A consort diagram is provided in
Figure 1, outlining reasons for dropout and/or exclusion. A
total of 81 athletes completed the study.
Study design. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel design study was used to examine the
effect of differing doses of DHA on plasma fatty acids and
serum NFL over the course of a season (189 d) of American
football to include off-season summer conditioning (57 d),
preseason camp (23 d), and the competitive season (109 d).
Before the start of summer conditioning, the American
football athletes were randomly assigned to ingest an oil
mixture providing either 2 gIdj1 DHA, 4 gIdj1 DHA, 6 gIdj1
DHA, or placebo, that is, corn oil, for the study duration.
Before the start of the season, blood was sampled at specific
intervals coincident with changes in intensity, hours of con-
tact, and coincident with those times in which the number and
magnitude of head impacts have been reported to change
(9,10). Upon reporting for summer conditioning, a baseline
blood sample was taken when volunteers returned from a
period of no contact (9 wk) (baseline; T1). Summer condi-
tioning consisted of strength and conditioning workouts
Monday through Friday for approximately 2 hIdj1. A second
sample was obtained at the conclusion of summer training
before preseason training camp (precamp; T2). In the time
between baseline and the start of training camp, no head-to-
head contact took place, but many of the athletes elected to
participate in nonsupervised seven on seven practices, which
involve no contact or equipment and occurred approximately
twice per week for 1 h. A third sample was collected after
preseason training camp (postcamp; T3). Camp began with
three noncontact practices in shorts and helmets, one practice
in helmet and shoulder pads, followed by full gear practices.
The first 5 d, practices were held once per day. Thereafter,
two-a-day practices were held every other day for the re-
mainder of camp. One day per week (Sunday), the athletes
were off from training and practice. The remaining blood
samples were taken throughout the competitive season on the
Monday after a Saturday game (48 h) (T4–T8). The first two
samplings (T4, T5) occurred during preconference play,
whereas the last three (T6–T8) occurred during conference
play. During the competitive season, athletes underwent a 1-h
shorts and helmets practice on Sunday, Monday was an off
day, followed by full pad practice on Tuesday, helmets and

 shoulder pads on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday were
shorts and helmets only (no full contact, incidental only). Dur-
ing the competition season, tackles were not taken to the
ground, hit and wrap only. Additionally, athletes would per-
form three strength and conditioning sessions per week. The
maximum (and median) number of head impacts per season for
an NCAA American football athlete has been reported to range
from 15.6 to 24 (4.8–7.5) and 58.5 to 86.1 (12.1–16.3) for
practices and games, respectively (9). All samplings throughout
the season occurred within 14- to 28-d intervals, with no
sampling occurring more than 28 d from the previous one.
Given that some American football athletes are known to have
a higher number of total contact hours due to the number of
plays (repetitions) per game, serum NFL was compared across
starters and nonstarters. Starters were defined as athletes
known to go out with the first or second team, first or second
on the depth roster, and take a majority of the repetitions (~20
to 40+ per game).
Supplementation. Before the beginning of summer
training, a 130-man roster of prospective volunteers from a
NCAA Division I American football team was provided to
research personnel. Potential participants were randomized by
player position (quarterback, offensive line, running back,
tight end, wide receiver, defensive line, linebacker, corner-
back, safety, specialist [i.e., kicker], incoming freshmen—no
positions listed) provided by coaching staff and subsequently
randomized to one of four treatment groups (2 gIdj1 DHA,
4 gIdj1 DHA, 6 gIdj1 DHA, or placebo) using a random
number generator. The algal DHA oil used in this study
(DHA-S oil; DSM Nutritional Products, Columbia, MD)
was derived from Schizochytrium sp. containing 35%–45%
DHA by weight. Wesson� corn oil, containing G 0.1% DHA,
was used as the placebo and in the 2 gIdj1 and 4 gIdj1 DHA
oil mixtures to ensure equal volume. To ensure proper dose the
lower limit (35%) of DHA content by weight contained in the
DHA-S oil was used for calculations. The oil mixture was

 weighed to the nearest 0.1 g on food scales (Ohaus CS-200,
Parsippany, NJ). All mixtures were flavored with artificial
flavoring as a masking agent. Stability of oil mixture was
verified by procedures outlined in ‘‘Fatty acid composition of
plasma’’ for preparation up to 7 d before delivery. The fatty
acid composition for both oils is shown in Table 1.
Participants were advised as to which foods were high in
DHA and asked to limit servings to no more than two per
week during the study. Supplement adherence was monitored
daily via visual supervision by the same research personnel.
To ensure compliance, supplement was given only on days
when the participants reported to the training facility resulting
in participants receiving supplement for 5, 7, and 5 dIwkj1 for
summer training, preseason camp, and the competitive sea-
son, respectively. Supplement compliance was set at Q80%
for each individual over the course of the study. The days
when supplement was not given were not taken into account
for calculating compliance.
Blood sampling and preparation. The night before
each blood collection, participants were verbally reminded
to ingest only water after 2200 h. On the day of blood
sampling, participants reported to the athletic training facility
after an overnight fast (Q 8 h), and supine blood samples were
collected via venipuncture from the antecubital fossa region
using standard, sterile phlebotomy procedures. Blood samples
were collected in spray-coated K2 ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid vacutainer tubes and serum vacutainer tube with no ad-
ditive (BD Diagnostics, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Vacutainer
tubes were kept on ice before blood collection and immedi-
ately placed on ice after blood collection. All samples were
centrifuged at 2000g for 30 min at 4-C (Beckman Coulter,
Allegra X-15R, Brea, CA) within 30 min of collection. Ali-
quots of serum, plasma, and red blood cells, collected via
sterile pipette from center of the red blood cell pack within the
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid vacutainer tubes, were im-
mediately transferred to prelabeled polypropylene vials .
Serum NFL. Serum NFL levels were determined using
the NF-Light kit from UmanDiagnostics (UmanDiagnostics,
Umeå, Sweden), transferred onto the Simoa platform using a
homebrew kit (Quanterix Corp, Boston, MA). The lower
limit of quantification was 1.95 pgImLj1. The analyses were
performed by a board-certified laboratory technician in one
round of experiments using one batch of reagents with intra-
assay coefficients of variation below 10%.
Fatty acid composition of plasma. Total lipid was
extracted and methylated according to previously described
procedures (2). Fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed
with a Varian gas chromatograph (model CP-3800 fixed
with a CP-8200 autosampler; Varian Inc., Walnut Creek, CA)
equipped with a fused silica capillary column CP-Sil88
(100 m � 0.25 mm i.d.; Chrompack Inc., Middleburg, The
Netherlands) (16). Individual fatty acid methyl esters were
identified using genuine standards (Nu-Chek Prep, Inc., Elysian,
MN), and response factors were calculated from a library of
commercially available methyl esters of palmitic, oleic, linoleic,
and arachidonic acid (ARA) from the same manufacturer. Data
are expressed as percent (%) total fatty acids.
Statistical analyses. A priori power analysis was
conducted using G*Power version 3.1.9 to determine the min-
imum sample size required to find significant changes in the
proportion of DHA in total plasma fatty acids with a desired
level of power set at 0.80, an >-level at 0.05, and a standardized
effect size calculated from a previous pilot study. It was de-
termined that a total of 20 subjects (five per group) were
needed to ensure adequate power.
The effects of supplementation and time on variables of
interest were calculated from a mixed model ANOVA in
SPSS V.22 (IBM Corporation; Armonk, NY). From that
model, estimates and uncertainty of the large-sample effect
size for the effect of treatment and time on dependent measures
were derived from the model to allow a magnitude-based
approach to inference (20). Effect sizes were calculated
and a modified classification system (trivial, 0.0–0.2;
small, 0.2–0.6; moderate, 0.6–1.2; large, 1.2–2.0; very large,
92.0; extremely large, 94.0) was used to further interpret
the magnitude of change. The probability (likelihood) that
a contrast was at least greater than the smallest threshold,
calculated as the standardized change of 0.2 times the
between-subject SD at baseline among all treatments was
qualified as follows: 0.5%, almost certainly not; 0.5%–5%,
very unlikely; 5%–25%, unlikely; 25%–75%, possible;
75%–95%, likely; 95%–99.5%, very likely; and 99.5%, al-
most certain. In the case where the majority (950%) of the
confidence interval lies between the threshold for substan-
tiveness and the probability of benefit or harm is G5.0%, the
effect was qualified trivial with the appropriate likelihood
qualifier (20).
RESULTS
Compliance and reported side effects. Mean com-
pliance over the course of the 189-d intervention was 94%,
90%, 95%, and 91% for 2 gIdj1 DHA, 4 gIdj1 DHA, 6 gIdj1
DHA, and placebo; respectively. Side effects of supplemental
DHA included initial gastrointestinal distress (n = 4), poor
palatability (n = 1), and smell (n = 1). These were only
reported once over the duration of the study.

 Effect of supplemental DHA on plasma DHA. The
change from T1 to T8 in proportion DHA, EPA, and ARA of
total plasma fatty acids is shown in Figures 2A–C, respectively.
DHA supplementation increased the proportion of DHA in
plasma fatty acids from baseline by a most likely (99.9%) large
magnitude (ES = 1.74–2.17) in a dose-dependent manner.
Clear contrasts were observed when examining change from
baseline in each dose, with very likely (98.0%) and most likely
(99.6%) substantially greater delta in the 6 gIdj1 DHA treat-
ment group, when compared with 4 gIdj1 (ES = 0.7; P =
0.006) and 2 gIdj1 (ES = 1.0; P = 0.001). Supplemental DHA
also increased plasma EPA in the 4 gIdj1 (ES = 0.6; P =
0.130) and 6 gIdj1 (ES = 1.7; P G 0.001) treatment groups.
However, clear contrasts for EPA were only observed in the
6 gIdj1 dose (mean difference, 0.23; 90% confidence inter-
val, T0.15%) when change from baseline was compared with
placebo (ES = 0.9; P = 0.016). ARA decreased in all DHA
treatment groups, as expected, with the most substantial
change observed in the 2 gIdj1 and 4 gIdj1 treatment groups
(ES = 1.2; P = 0.001 and ES = 1.2; P = 0.002, respectively).
Serum NFL over the course of the season. Serum
NFL increased substantially over the course of the season in
those participants categorized as starters (Figure 3A). The ob-
served increase occurred coincident with changes in intensity
and hours of contact. The postcamp (T3) serum NFL increase
observed was very likely (97.4%), but small in magnitude in
starters (ES = 0.4; P = 0.001) compared with baseline (T1). As
expected, a similar albeit smaller increase was observed in
nonstarter (ES = 0.3; P = 0.043) as those in this category would
have experienced the most contact during the time from
precamp (T2) to postcamp (T3). All other contrasts in the
nonstarters were trivial. However, serum NFL continued to be
elevated the remainder of the competition season in starters,
with a further very likely (99.5%) increase of moderate mag-
nitude occurring at T6 (ES = 0.6; P G 0.001), coincident with
conference play. A further increase was noted at T7 (ES = 0.8;
P G 0.001), which remained elevated to the end of the com-
petitive season (ES = 0.7; P G 0.001). The increase observed
over the course of the study in starters resulted in substantial
differences noted over the course of the study when compared
with nonstarters (Table 2). Similarly, the area under the curve
calculation determination resulted in a very likely (97.4%)
difference of moderate magnitude (600; T 430 pgImLj1; ES =
0.6; P = 0.024) between starters (1995 T 1383 pgImLj1) and
nonstarters (1398 T 581 pgImLj1).
Effect of supplemental DHA attenuates on serum
NFL. Because of the lack of change in serum NFL, those
athletes categorized as nonstarters were excluded from further
analyses. The effect of DHA supplementation irrespective of
dose (i.e., collapsed across treatments) compared with placebo
is presented in Figure 3B, whereas Figure 3C shows the effect
of the different doses on serum NFL over the course of the
football season. Both figures are presented as percent change
from baseline. Statistical contrasts comparing each dose to
placebo with corresponding mean T SD are shown in Table 3.
When collapsed across all treatment groups, supplemental
DHA likely (92.3%) attenuated serum NFL postcamp (P =
0.070; Table 3), coincident with postcamp (T3), in which a
substantial increase in serum NFL was observed in starters.
During conference play, when a second substantial increase
in serum NFL was observed among starters, supplementation
with DHA resulted in a likely (87.1%) lowering effect com-
pared with placebo (P = 0.144, T6), which continued through
the end of the study when a likely (T7, 97.5%; T8, 98.9%)

 lowering of serum NFL was observed in those supplementing
with DHA compared with placebo (P = 0.022, T7; P = 0.012,
T8). Examination of the effect of the differing doses on serum
NFL resulted in fewer athletes in each group (Table 3).
However, we observed a likely and very likely substantial
lowering effect of 2 gIdj1 DHA compared with placebo over
the course of the study. In those supplementing with 4 gIdj1
DHA and 6 gIdj1 DHA, all contrasts were unclear with the
exception of the final time point in which a likely (91.0%)
substantial lowering effect was observed in those in the
4 gIdj1 treatment.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we examined the effect of differing doses of
DHA on plasma fatty acids and serum NFL, a biomarker of
head trauma, over the course of a season in American foot-
ball athletes. This study provides novel data specific to the op-
timal dose of DHA for plasma and biomarker changes in
American football athletes. Further, the data presented herein
demonstrate that a season of American football is associated
with some level of subconcussive injury, which results in a
measurable increase in a marker of axonal damage. Most im-
portantly, we report for the first time that supplemental DHA,
irrespective of dose, may likely attenuate elevations in serum
NFL coincident with those times in which an increased number
and magnitude of head impacts typically occurs in American
football athletes.
The neuroprotective effects of supplemental DHA ob-
served in rodent models of TBI demonstrated greatest effi-
cacy when administered at a dose of 40 mgIkgj1Idj1) (6),
which corresponds to a dose of approximately 4 gIkgj1Idj1
in today_s collegiate American football athlete (29). How-
ever, in analyzing the dose–response effect, Arterburn et al.
(5) reported a dose-dependent relationship in which plasma
DHA increases up to a dosage of approximately 2 gIdj1;
above this dose, the authors reported only incremental in-
creases are observed as saturation is approached (5). The
finding of a dose–response effect is in agreement with those
findings (5); however, the substantial increases observed at
the 4 gIdj1 and 6 gIdj1 dose suggest that higher doses may
be necessary because no apparent plateau was noted. This is
not surprising given the large size of American football
athletes compared with the general population and other
athletes (38). Despite having relatively high body mass, the
subjects in those studies analyzed by Arterburn et al. (2)
were lower than those reported in American football athletes
(23,29). Further, American football athletes undergo rigor-
ous physical training and activity, which is known to influ-
ence plasma fatty acid composition (28).
The lack of an observable increase in EPA in those re-
ceiving 2 gIdj1 DHA combined with a lack of clear contrasts
when comparing change from baseline in those receiving
4 gIdj1 DHA versus placebo supports the assertion that a
higher dose may be necessary in American football athletes.
While retroconversion of DHA to EPA is regularly observed
(5,25), Mori et al. (24) reported only a small nonsignificant
increase in EPA following a 6-wk intervention in which
overweight men received supplemental DHA in a dose of
4 gIdj1 DHA. Further, physical activity is known to affect
fatty acid composition (28) which may be why increases

 in EPA are not readily observed in this population. Inter-
estingly, the largest decrease in ARA occurred in those
receiving 2 gIdj1 DHA. Though a similar dose-dependent
reduction in ARA is typically observed, the response has
been reported to be variable when examining a number of
studies (5). This study and in particular changes in the
fatty acid profile contributes important new information
specific to optimizing DHA supplementation in American
football athletes.
It is well known that American football athletes are ex-
posed to head impacts that vary in number and magnitude
over the course of a season (9). Further, those routine head
impacts sustained result in rotational acceleration/deceleration
and propagation of force through the brain (10), impacts
known to cause diffuse axonal injury (1,8). It has been
suggested that NFL, albeit in CSF, is one of the most sen-
sitive biomarkers of head trauma, specifically axonal injury
(26,40). Recently, Al Nimer et al. (3) reported that a sig-
nificant relationship exists between CSF NFL and serum
NFL in severe TBI. As such, elevations of NFL in peripheral
blood would indicate some level of axonal injury. Thus, the
finding of marked elevations after periods in which an
increase in number and magnitude of head impacts was
likely (9) suggests that some level of axonal damage occurs
in American football athletes over the course of a season in
the absence of a concussion diagnosis.
Indeed, Davenport et al. (12) reported that the risk
weighted exposure, a metric defined as the collected risk of
concussion over the course of a season(36), showed strong
associations with DTI scalars in American football athletes
at the high school level in the absence of a concussion di-
agnosis. Most studies using DTI in TBI and mTBI report
that the changes reported in those specific scalars identified
by Davenport et al. (12) result from axonal injury (4,27).
The number of high-level impacts are more frequent in
collegiate compared with high school players (31); thus, our
data support that the subconcussive impacts sustained by
collegiate American football players results in some degree
of axonal injury. The primary inferential limitation to the
current data is the lack of an outcome measure related to the
actual number of head impacts sustained over the course of
the season. As a result, our ability to discern if the elevations
in serum NFL were a result of axonal damage caused by
head impacts or from another source, such as muscle, is

 limited. However, despite participating in practice over the
course of the season, serum NFL did not vary in those cat-
egorized as nonstarters, suggesting that the elevations ob-
served herein were in fact a result of impacts to the head.
Perhaps, the most novel finding of the current study was
that supplemental DHA likely attenuated the increase ob-
served in serum NFL. Interestingly, the lowest dose (2 gIdj1)
appeared to produce the most marked reductions in serum
NFL compared with placebo. However, inference about the
differing doses is limited by the number of starters in each
group. Previous studies in rodent models of TBI support the
possibility that DHA reduces markers of axonal injury (6,32).
Fewer numbers of A-amyloid precursor protein–positive
axons, a marker of axonal injury, were reported in animals
receiving supplemental DHA for 30 d before impact accel-
eration injury (6). More recently, Schober et al. (32) exam-
ined the effect of DHA on DTI indices of white matter injury
using an established model for pediatric TBI, controlled cor-
tical impact (22). DHA decreased the increment in radial
diffusivity observed in the DTI following controlled cortical
impact, increased radial diffusivity is correlated with histo-
logic axonal damage (35). Thus, our data are in support of
previous studies in which DHA has been shown to provide
neuroprotective effect in rodent models of TBI. Although a
number of mechanisms have been proposed, the exact mech-
anism underlying the neuroprotective effects of DHA are as of
yet unknown. Our findings are in support of those findings in
which DHA attenuated markers of axonal injury in rodent
models. However, we report on the potential effectiveness of
DHA for axonal injury caused by subconcussive impacts in
American football athletes, the first to date.
The current study has several limitations. First, our results
are limited by the sample size, particularly because it relates
to starters. Based on preliminary data and the absence of an
optimal dose regimen for DHA for the larger American
football athlete at the time of design, we sought to experi-
mentally define an optimal dose. In doing so, this limited the
number of starters in each treatment group, making inter-
pretation of the optimal dose for neuroprotective effect of
DHA difficult. However, the likely decrease in serum NFL
in the presence of all doses of DHA (collapsed across
treatment) was apparent throughout the season, though this
may have been attributed mostly to those athletes receiving
2 gIdj1 DHA. A larger sample size in a confirmatory study
is suggested. Second, the lack of an outcome measure for
number of head impacts limits inference as to the origination
of NFL appearing in peripheral blood. No increase was ob-
served in the nonstarters participating in strenuous practice
which suggests that NFL was indeed from head impacts.
Further study is warranted to examine the relationship be-
tween the number of head impacts and serum NFL levels in
this population using a more direct measure of head impacts
(i.e., telemetry data collection). The inclusion of DTI would
also provide additional support.
In conclusion, the data presented herein demonstrate that
American football athletes likely require a higher dose of
DHA than the average population. Further, serum NFL in-
creases in those categorized as starters coincident with those
times in which the number of head impacts likely increases.
Most importantly, we report for the first time that supple-
mental DHA likely attenuates the increase in serum NFL,
suggesting a neuroprotective effect of DHA, specifically
because it relates to axonal injury, the central pathogenic
mechanism in mTBI. The latter agrees with previous reports of
the neuroprotective effects of DHA in rodent models of TBI.
Our study contributes important information on the effects of
DHA on a biological marker of head trauma in a population
known to sustain a significant number of head impacts. Given
the potential of DHA to provide neuroprotection and the fact
that it is well tolerated and safe at any age, further study is
warranted to elucidate the true nature of the effect and its po-
tential prophylactic use.
