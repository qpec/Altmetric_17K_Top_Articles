Abstract
Background: Evidence suggests that childhood near-roadway air pollution (NRAP) exposures contribute to
increased body mass index (BMI); however, effects of NRAP exposure during the vulnerable periods including in utero and
first year of life have yet to be established. In this study, we examined whether exposure to elevated concentrations of
NRAP during in utero and/or first year of life increase childhood BMI growth.
Methods: Participants in the Children’s Health Study enrolled from 2002 to 2003 with annual visits over a four-year period
and who changed residences before study entry were included (n = 2318). Annual height and weight were measured
and lifetime residential NRAP exposures including in utero and first year of life periods were estimated by nitrogen oxides
(NOx) using the California line-source dispersion model. Linear mixed effects models assessed in utero or first year near-
road freeway and non-freeway NOx exposures and BMI growth after adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, parental
education, Spanish questionnaire, and later childhood near-road NOx exposure.
Results: A two-standard deviation difference in first year of life near-road freeway NOx exposure was associated with a 0.
1 kg/m2 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.03, 0.2) faster increase in BMI growth per year and a 0.5 kg/m2 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.9)
higher attained BMI at age 10 years.
Conclusions: Higher exposure to early life NRAP increased the rate of change of childhood BMI and resulted in a higher
attained BMI at age 10 years that were independent of later childhood exposures. These findings suggest that elevated
early life NRAP exposures contribute to increased obesity risk in children.

Background
In the United States, approximately 32% of children 2
to 19 years were overweight or obese in 2011–2012
[1]. High prevalence of childhood obesity present
significant clinical and public health problems since
obese children are more likely to become obese adults
[2, 3] and are at a greater risk for developing type 2
diabetes and cardiovascular disease [4–7]. Despite de-
cades of diet and physical activity interventions, the
prevalence of childhood obesity remains high [8]. Pre-
vious studies have shown that increased near-roadway
air pollution (NRAP) exposure [9, 10] and increased
traffic density [9, 11] during childhood contributes to
increased obesity risk in children. These findings sug-
gest that modifiable environmental factors such as air
pollution exposures may be contributing to the obes-
ity epidemic [9, 12].
Longitudinal
studies
have
shown
that
increased
mid-childhood NRAP exposure and traffic density
are associated with substantially increased body mass
index (BMI) growth and a higher level of attained
BMI at ages 18 [11] and 10 years [9]. Furthermore,
increased childhood NRAP exposures, secondhand

 smoke (SHS), and maternal smoking during preg-
nancy were associated with increased BMI growth
and a higher BMI at age 18 years [10]. To date, few
studies have examined the effects of in utero and
early childhood NRAP exposure on childhood BMI
growth. Beyond mid-childhood exposures, early life
periods like in utero and first year of life represent
critical windows of air pollution exposure that may
significantly alter childhood growth trajectories. One
epidemiological study found that increased in utero
ambient polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon exposure, a
marker for NRAP, was associated with higher BMI
z-scores at age 5 and 7 years [13]. Additionally, re-
cent data from the Boston Birth Cohort showed that
in utero and early life exposures to ambient, fine
particulate matter ≤2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5) were
significantly associated with increased risk of child-
hood overweight or obesity in children 2–9 years of
age [14]. Although these studies suggest that ele-
vated NRAP exposures during early life and child-
hood may increase future obesity risk, studies have
not been entirely consistent as a European birth co-
hort recently reported no association of first 4 years
of life NRAP exposure and childhood obesity at
4 years and 8 years of age [15].
Despite mixed findings, in utero and first year of life
are periods of rapid growth that are highly susceptible to
environmental influences [16]. Lasting effects of
in
utero and early life environmental exposures on child-
hood growth trajectories have been shown, and these
early life stages are critical periods for the development
of obesity [16, 17]. For example, past studies have re-
ported associations of increased in utero air pollution
exposure and restricted fetal growth resulting in low
birth weight (LBW) in full term babies [18–20]. Conse-
quently, term babies with LBW have been shown to have
postnatal catch-up growth which in turn has been asso-
ciated with higher weight gain through infancy and
childhood [21, 22]. Because in utero and first year of life
are important developmental periods that influence
growth, increased NRAP exposure during these critical
periods may be contributing to future obesity risk
through altered growth trajectories resulting in faster
childhood BMI growth. The objective of this study was
to examine the relationships between in utero and first
year of life NRAP exposures with longitudinal measure-
ments of BMI in a subset of Southern California chil-
dren enrolled in the Children’s Health Study (CHS).
We hypothesized that higher in utero and/or first year
of life NRAP exposure is associated with a faster in-
crease in BMI growth over a 4-year follow up period
and a higher attained BMI at age 10 years, and that
these early life NRAP effects are independent of
NRAP exposures later in childhood.
Methods
Study design
From 2002 to 2003, a cohort of kindergarten and first
grade children were recruited from 45 public schools
across 13 Southern California communities (Fig. 1). De-
tails of CHS recruitment methods have been previously
presented [23]. Informed consents were obtained from
parents and assents from children. This study was
reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review
Board at the University of Southern California.
Height and weight were measured at baseline and at
each subsequent, annual school visit. A trained techni-
cian measured height to the nearest centimeter and
weight to the nearest pound (0.45 kg) of each child with-
out shoes and with daily calibrations of the weight scale.
BMI was calculated by weight/height2 (kilograms/meters2)
and overweight and obese were defined using the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) age-and
sex-specific growth charts [24]. Parents completed base-
line and yearly follow-up questionnaires pertaining to
sociodemographic factors, characteristics of the home,
and other covariates that were explored as potential con-
founders.
These
included
age,
sex,
race/ethnicity,
self-reported premature birth, maternal smoking during
pregnancy, residential SHS, lifetime history of asthma,
parental education (marker for socioeconomic status), if
baseline questionnaire was completed in Spanish (marker
for recent immigration status), and child’s participation in
team sports during the past year. A subset of children had
birth weight and gestational age at birth which were ex-
tracted from the California vital statistics records. These
data were obtained using the CDC LINKPLUS program
which matched CHS children to the state’s vital records
database using several variables including child’s name,
sex, birthdate, as well as, mother’s name, birthdate, zip
code, and father’s name.
NRAP exposures
Lifetime residential history was collected from all CHS
participants at study enrollment and at each annual
CHS visit via questionnaires, including move in and
move out dates for each residence. NRAP exposures
were
estimated
based
on
street
level
geocoded,
residential locations from in utero to the most current
follow-up date, which gave estimates of NRAP exposure
for in utero, first year of life, and childhood periods. For
in utero exposures, street address level data from study
questionnaires (74.8%) and birth certificates (25.2%)
were used. Residential addresses were uploaded to the
ESRI
geocoding
database
and
software
(ESRI
Inc.,
Redlands, CA http://www.esri.com), geocoded to street
level using the software, and assigned latitude and
longitude coordinates. Google Earth and the Texas

 A&M geocoder [25] were also used to assign coordinates
for a small number of problematic residential addresses.
The California line-source dispersion model (CALINE4)
was used to estimate concentrations of traffic-related nitro-
gen oxides (NOx) for freeway and non-freeway roads using
EMFAC2011 (for 1994–1999) and EMFAC2014 (for >
1999) vehicle emission rates, traffic volume, road geometry
and meteorological conditions, including wind speed and
direction, pollution mixing heights, and atmospheric stabil-
ity [26]. Our roadway information is classified according to
Feature Class Codes (FCC) which includes (1) primary
highways with limited access (freeways), (2) primary roads
without limited access, (3) secondary and connecting roads,
and (4) local, neighborhood, and rural roads. Annual aver-
age traffic volumes from imbedded loop sensors provide
100% coverage for freeways and 95% coverage for state
highways (Class 2). The freeways have data for each link be-
tween interchanges whereas data for Class 2 roads is often
extrapolated for longer distances to provide full coverage
for all links. About 5% of smaller roads have traffic volume
measurements and because these measurements are often
on higher volume roads within their class, we assign the
25th percentile of annual traffic volume to all roads in the
corresponding class. Exposure to NRAP was modeled using
monthly average CALINE4 estimated NOx concentrations
from freeway and non-freeway sources within 5 km of the
residential coordinates during the in utero, first year of life,
and mid-childhood periods. In utero near-road NOx expos-
ure was defined as the nine-month average exposure prior
to birth and first year of life near-road NOx exposure was
defined as the twelve-month average exposure after birth.
Lastly, to account for childhood near-road NOx exposures
beyond the early life periods, childhood NRAP exposure
was calculated as the average near-road NOx exposure from
13 months of age through the 4-year study follow up
period. Traffic pollutants are a complex mixture of gases
and particles that include NOx, carbon monoxide, elemen-
tal carbon, particulate matter, organic compounds, and
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons amongst others. These
NRAP exposures reflect increases in local vehicle emissions
beyond background ambient levels. Therefore, NRAP was
modeled
using
near-road
NOx
from
freeway
and
non-freeway roadways as a marker for traffic pollution as
this measure is highly correlated with other pollutants esti-
mated by CALINE4.
Statistical methods
Linear mixed effects models [27, 28] were fitted to esti-
mate longitudinal relationships between BMI trajectory
and in utero and first year of life NRAP exposures. We
examined the associations of in utero or first year of life
near-road NOx exposure from freeway and non-freeway

 roads with 1) the rate of change in BMI during 4 years
of study follow up and 2) the attained BMI level at age
10 years. Due to the high correlation of in utero and first
year of life near-road NOx exposures (correlation r = 0.8
for freeway, r = 0.93 for non-freeway), these two early life
periods were analyzed in separate models.
Specifically, the following multi-level mixed effects
model was used in the analysis. Let repeated measures
of BMI (Ycij) with c, i, and j representing the study
community, individual, and year of BMI measurement,
respectively. Then,
Level 1: Ycij = aciaci + bci(tcij − C) + γ1(EFij − EFi) + γ2Wij + εcij.
Level 2a (level): aci = ac + α1EUi + α2EFi + α3Zi + δci
Level 2b (growth): bci = β0 + β1EUi + β2EFi + β3Zi + σci
Level 3a: ac = α0 + εc
In Level 1, tcij is the age of participants at each visit
centered by age C (10 years), and γ1 represents
cross-sectional association between year to year fluc-
tuations of near-road NOx with follow up BMI meas-
ure at each study visit. EFij reflects average near-road
NOx exposure for the time between each subsequent
follow
up
visit
and
EFiis
the
average
childhood
near-road NOx exposure from 13 months of age till
last height/weight measure in 2006–2007 school year.
Importantly, in this analysis we wanted to elucidate
associations of in utero or first year of life near-road
NOx exposures (EUi) with BMI growth independent of
childhood near-road NOx exposures. Therefore, the
mixed
model
also
includes
average
childhood
near-road NOx exposures (EFi) while accounting for
yearly
deviations
of
near-road
NOx
during
this
follow-up period (EFij − EFi).
In levels 2a and 2b, α1 and β1 correspond to estimated
effects of in utero near-road NOx exposure (or first year
of life) on attained BMI level at age 10 years and the
growth of BMI during the follow-up period, respectively.
Whereas, α2 and β2 correspond to estimated effects of
childhood near-road NOx exposure on attained BMI
level at age 10 years and the growth of BMI during the
childhood period, respectively. Furthermore, α3Zi de-
notes adjustment factors for time-independent covariates
at BMI level at age 10, β3Zi are adjustment factors for
BMI growth during follow-up, εcij, εc, δci and σci reflect
error terms at each level of model to account for the
random variations across communities and internal cor-
relations of repeated measures from each subject over
time. In addition, nonlinearity of BMI growth trajectory
was tested by looking at the slope of BMI growth over
time from baseline age 6.5 years to 10 years. We found
no deviations from a linear trend as this is a relatively
short period of growth ~ 3.5 years, and children in this
age range have not yet reached puberty where growth
tends to be nonlinear. Therefore, linear BMI growth was
considered in the final analysis.
The current analysis included 2318 children who: 1)
completed a baseline questionnaire, 2) had at least two
measures of BMI across the 4-year study follow-up
period, 3) had NRAP exposure data for the time win-
dows of interest, and 4) moved homes prior to study en-
rollment to avoid collinearity between NRAP exposures
during the in utero or first year of life periods with later
childhood exposures (Fig. 2; Additional file 1). Children
who lived in the same residence from birth through
follow-up had a high correlation of NRAP exposures
across each time period, therefore all analyses were re-
stricted to “Movers”. “Movers” were subjects who had a
change in address between the in utero period and study
enrollment that resulted in a move farther than or equal
to 500 m. This selection method allowed us to look at
later NRAP exposures in childhood in the same model
as the early life exposures, in utero and first year of life.
In the “Movers” group, NRAP exposure periods had
lower correlations, which allowed us to use the modeling
framework described.
Mixed
effects
models
were
used
to
examine
age-adjusted associations between baseline characteris-
tics and BMI growth as well as attained BMI at age
10 years. These characteristics were identified as con-
founders and included in the final model if they resulted
in a ≥ 10% change in the effect estimate for BMI growth
or attained BMI at age 10 years. Of the identified poten-
tial confounders, age, sex, race/ethnicity, parental educa-
tion, and Spanish baseline questionnaire were included
as confounders in the final model. Furthermore, effect
modification by sex and race/ethnicity was tested using
interaction terms in the full model. Effect estimates of
NRAP exposure on BMI growth as well as attained BMI
level at age 10 years are reported for a two-standard

Results
Baseline characteristics are reported in Table 1. At study
entry, the mean age was 6.5 years (SD: 0.7) and 50.6%
were male. Approximately 29% of children were over-
weight or obese using CDC growth chart cutoffs [24]
with a mean BMI percentile of 60.5 (SD: 30.1) at study
entry. Children were predominately Hispanic (56%) or
Non-Hispanic White (33%), where 22% of the parents
completed the baseline questionnaire in Spanish, which
was used a marker of recent immigration status. On
average, more than half of the children included in this
study had parents with an education level above high
school. SHS exposure was relatively low where 7% of
mothers smoked during pregnancy and 5% of children
Kim et al. Environmental Health  (2018) 17:64 
Page 4 of 10
 lived in homes where someone smoked daily in the pres-
ence of the child. At the end of the study follow up
period, the mean age of children was 9.5 years (SD: 1.2).
Age-adjusted associations between each baseline char-
acteristic and BMI growth trajectory and attained BMI
at age 10 years are also shown in Table 1. Briefly, BMI
growth through the study period was associated with
baseline overweight/obesity status, sex, race/ethnicity,
parental education, Spanish questionnaire, residential
SHS as well as participating in an organized team sport
(p < 0.05 for each characteristic). BMI at age 10 years
was associated with baseline overweight/obesity status,
race/ethnicity, parental education, Spanish question-
naire, residential SHS, and participating in an organized
team sport (p < 0.05 for each characteristic). The correl-
ation between in utero and childhood freeway NRAP ex-
posures was 0.35 (p < 0.0001) and the correlation between
the first year of life and childhood freeway NRAP exposures
was 0.58 (p < 0.0001) (Additional file 1).
Because our analysis was limited to movers only, com-
parison
of
baseline
characteristics
of
movers
and
non-movers can be found in Additional file 2. Movers
were slightly older at baseline (6.5 years, SD = 0.7)
compared to non-movers (6.3 years, SD = 0,7). Racial/
ethnics groups differed between movers and non-movers
with more Hispanic children in the non-movers group,
63% versus 56% in movers. Movers had more parents
with an above high school education (62%) compared to
non-movers (51%) and non-movers had more parents
who filled out the baseline questionnaire in Spanish
(37%) than movers (22%). Movers had a higher partici-
pation in organized team sports (42%) than non-movers
(34%). Movers and non-movers did not differ in obesity
status,
sex,
self-reported
premature
birth,
maternal
smoking
during
pregnancy,
residential
second-hand
smoke, and lifetime history of asthma.
Residential NRAP exposures measured in near-road
NOx for freeway and non-freeway sources for in utero,
first year of life and childhood periods are described in
Table 2.
Mean near-road NOx exposures from freeway road-
ways during in utero, first year of life, and childhood
were 16.7 parts per billion (ppb) (SD: 20.1), 16.2 ppb
(SD: 19.5), and 15.1 ppb (SD: 18.9), and mean near-road
NOx exposures from non-freeway roadways during in
utero, first year of life, and childhood were 10.3 ppb (SD:

Associations of early life NRAP exposures with childhood
BMI
First year of life exposures to NRAP from freeway roads
were positively associated with BMI at age 10 years and
BMI growth during study follow up and these associa-
tions were independent of mid-childhood NRAP expo-
sures (Table 3).
For first year of life (model 2), a 39.1 ppb difference in
near-road freeway NOx exposure was significantly asso-
ciated with a 0.1 kg/m2 (95% confidence interval (CI):
0.03, 0.2) faster increase in BMI per year resulting in a
0.5 kg/m2 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.9) higher BMI at age 10 years.
For in utero (model 1), a 40.1 ppb difference in
near-road freeway NOx exposure was associated with a
0.05 kg/m2 (95% CI: -0.02, 0.1) faster increase in BMI
per year and a 0.1 kg/m2 (95% CI: -0.3, 0.5) higher BMI
at age 10 years; however, these estimates did not reach
statistical significance after adjusting for confounders
(Table 3).
In contrast, non-freeway NRAP exposures during
mid-childhood were associated with BMI at age 10 years
and BMI growth while early life non-freeway NRAP ex-
posures showed no significant association (Table 4).
Additionally, near-road total NOx exposures were similar
in
magnitude
to
that
of
near-road
freeway
NOx
exposures (Additional file 3).
Based on tests for interaction and the analysis strati-
fied by effect modifiers, there was little evidence to sup-
port differences in effects of early life freeway NRAP
exposure by sex (males versus females), race/ethnicity
(Non-Hispanic Whites versus Hispanics), and baseline
overweight/obese status (overweight/obese versus nor-
mal BMI) (Additional files 4, 5 and 6). In a subsample of
children who had complete data of birth weight and ges-
tational age (n = 2129), birth weight and gestational age
did not significantly change the effects of in utero or first
year of life near-road freeway NOx exposure on BMI
growth and BMI at age 10 years (Additional file 7). We
also explored effects of in utero and first year of life am-
bient PM2.5 exposures on childhood BMI trajectory
however we did not see any significant associations
(Additional file 8). We conducted further sensitivity ana-
lysis comparing independent contributions of in utero or
first year of life near-road freeway NOx exposures
without adjustments of mid-childhood exposures on
BMI trajectory for movers and non-movers to assess
possibility of selection bias (Additional file 9). We found
similar
growth
trajectories
amongst
movers
and
non-movers when looking at in utero or first year of life
NRAP exposures.
Discussion
In our study population of school-aged children in
Southern California, higher first year of life NRAP from
freeway sources were associated with faster increases in
BMI during childhood after adjusting for confounders
such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, parental education,
Spanish questionnaire, and mid-childhood NRAP expo-
sures. These longitudinal associations were independent
of mid-childhood NRAP exposures and resulted in sig-
nificant differences in BMI at age 10 years, suggesting
that early life NRAP exposures may represent important
windows of exposure that increase risk for developing
childhood obesity. Previous studies of this cohort have
shown that increased mid-childhood NRAP was associ-
ated with increased BMI growth where children in the
highest 10% of non-freeway NOx exposure showed a
0.39 kg/m2 higher BMI at age 10 years and a 0.087 kg/
m2 faster increase in BMI per year when compared to
those in the lowest 10% of exposure using a similar
modeling approach [9]. We found consistent results as
those reported in Jerrett et al. 2014 using our childhood,
non-freeway NRAP exposure in our subset of children

 with longitudinal BMI measures, movers only, as well as
movers with in utero NRAP exposures, and movers with
first year of life NRAP exposures suggesting that the
NRAP association were not the result of selecting
movers for this study (Additional file 10).
Collectively, these results suggest that specific compo-
nents of NRAP exposure in freeway versus non-freeway
mixtures may independently contribute to obesity risk
during different periods of early life and childhood. Ve-
hicle exhaust is the main contributor to NRAP and
chemical composition of freeway and non-freeway roads
have shown to be different due to differences in vehicle
types and vehicle volume [29]. For example, heavy duty
diesel trucks with compression ignition engines travel
most densely on freeways compared to non-freeway
roads particularly in Southern California, and diesel
truck emissions also differ from spark ignition engine
emissions which are primarily gasoline derived passenger
vehicles. Furthermore, a study in Texas also showed that
three different road types had notable differences in
chemical composition due to the varying vehicle types
and emissions [30, 31]. Due to differences in total vol-
ume and emissions from diesel engine versus gasoline
engine vehicles, chemical composition downwind of
freeway and non-freeway roadways is expected to differ.
Our findings build on previous work in animal studies
that have reported associations of early life air pollution
exposures and obesity [32, 33]. In mice, in utero expos-
ure to diesel exhaust predisposed offspring to higher
weight gain when fed a high fat diet compared to those
offspring exposed to filtered air and given a high fat diet
[32]. Additionally, Sprague Dawley rats exposed to unfil-
tered Beijing air pollution prenatally and continuously
after birth had significantly higher fat mass at 8 weeks
[33]. Together, results from our study coupled with
animal models suggest that early life exposures may rep-
resent a critical window of exposure where increased
NRAP may result in increased risk for higher childhood
BMI trajectories, which in turn may lead to childhood
obesity.
The biological mechanisms linking air pollution expos-
ure with increased childhood BMI remain uncertain.
However, animal models suggest inflammatory pathways
where increased air pollution exposures have been
shown to result in higher levels of circulating proinflam-
matory cytokines, inflammation in the lungs, lower
levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines as well as adipose
tissue inflammation [33–35]. Exposures may also have
effects on the brain via neuroinflammation where in-
creased in utero air pollution exposure was shown to
stimulate appetite or anxiety induced over-eating in mice
[32]. Additionally, animal models suggest that increased
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon exposure, a byproduct
of traffic combustion, may increase white adipose tissue
accumulation and inhibit lipolysis [36, 37]. These animal
studies have uncovered some of the potential mecha-
nisms underlying the associations between increased in
utero and early life NRAP exposures with obesity. Our
study builds on this work by showing longitudinal
associations between early life NRAP exposure and BMI
growth in children 6–10 years of age.
Despite the strengths of this study, dietary data was
unavailable and residual confounding may have occurred
since poor diet, such as increased sugar-sweetened bev-
erage consumption, is associated with increased risk of
childhood obesity [38, 39] and NRAP exposure through
lower socioeconomic position [40]. However, the models
adjusted for important covariates that may be related to
these factors and it is unlikely that results are fully ex-
plained by residual confounding. The current study used
residential based estimates of NRAP exposure with
near-road NOx concentrations as a marker of NRAP ex-
posures. While exposure misclassification may have oc-
curred, misclassification should be random amongst
subjects therefore biasing estimates toward the null. This
study was also limited to BMI from annual height and
weight measures since direct measures of adiposity were
not performed [41]. Lastly, since in utero and first year
of life NRAP exposures were highly correlated, we are
unable to conclude the relative contribution of each ex-
posure window (i.e., in utero versus first year of life) to
increased childhood BMI.
Conclusions
Our results show that increased first year of life
near-road freeway NOx exposures are associated with in-
creased velocity of childhood BMI growth trajectory and
higher attained BMI at 10 years and remained robust
after controlling for multiple confounders as well as
childhood near-road freeway NOx exposures. Further-
more, increased childhood near-roadway exposures from

 non-freeway sources were associated with increased BMI
growth and higher BMI at 10 years, consistent with our
past findings. These results, along with other epidemio-
logical and animal studies, implicate environmental ex-
posures such as NRAP as potential risk factors for
higher childhood BMI growth and higher attained BMI
at age 10 years. These findings have significant public
health relevance for intervention since the number of
children living near freeways and busy roadways is large
and continues to increase [42]. Additional epidemio-
logical and experimental studies are warranted to exam-
ine the mechanisms by which early life NRAP exposures
may impact early growth trajectories in children.
