Abstract
Objectives: This study evaluated the successful aging model by assessing the impact of two forms of productive engage-
ment—working and volunteering—as potential interventions in the process of disablement.
Method: The Health and Retirement Study was used to (a) estimate two-stage selection equations of (i) currently working 
part time and full time and (ii) currently volunteering less than 100 hours and volunteering 100 hours or more per year (net 
of chronic health problems) and (b) assess whether, net of selection, working, and volunteering moderate the association 
between chronic conditions and subsequent functional limitations.
Results: Chronic conditions were associated with elevated levels of subsequent functional limitations, whereas both work-
ing and volunteering were associated with lower levels of subsequent functional limitations. Moreover, workers and vol-
unteers of less than 100 hours per year experienced a reduction in the association of chronic conditions on subsequent 
functional limitations.
Discussion: This research highlights the role of productive engagement as a key element in successful aging. Not only do 
work and volunteering have direct associations with health outcomes themselves, but they also act as potential interven-
tions in the process of disablement by attenuating the way in which chronic conditions are translated into subsequent 
functional limitations. This suggests that (a) future research should apply successful aging models to health processes as 
well as health outcomes and (b) policy makers should support social institutions that foster late-life productive engagement.
Keywords: Chronic condition—Disability—Employment—Successful aging—Volunteer activity
According to the successful aging model, maintaining high 
levels of physical functioning is one of the keys to living a 
“better than usual” life as one continues to age. Not only is 
being functionally healthy important for living a happy and 
healthy life, but being functionally limited is associated with 
both personal and societal level costs (Federal Interagency 
Forum on Aging-Related Statistics, 2012; Ostchega, Harris, 
Hirsch, Parsons, & Kington, 2000). Therefore, understand-
ing the individual pathways leading to functional limita-
tions—as well as the social institutions that may influence 
these pathways—are critically important social goals.
In terms of individual pathways, chronic conditions have 
been identified as one of the leading causes of becoming 
functionally limited in the United States (Verbrugge & Jette,

 1994). People who experience chronic conditions are more 
likely to become functionally limited and experience greater 
levels of functional limitations (Boult, Kane, Louis, Boult, & 
McCaffrey, 1994; Wolff, Boult, Boyd, & Anderson, 2005). 
Therefore, just as it is important to understand the pathways 
to functional limitations, so too is it important to identify 
potential interventions that may reduce the extent to which 
chronic conditions lead to subsequent functional limitations.
One intervention that may be particularly meaningful is 
productive engagement. Indeed, according to the success-
ful aging model, activities like work and volunteering are 
generally important because they increase both “physical 
engagement … and social interaction” thereby leading to 
lower risks of mortality, as well as increased physical and 
mental health (Carr, Fried, & Rowe, 2015; Luoh & Herzog, 
2002). However, it is heretofore unclear whether they may 
also help reduce the progression of disablement associated 
with living with chronic conditions. To that end, we lever-
age insights from the successful aging model and the disa-
blement process model, as well as the 1998 to 2012 waves 
of the Health and Retirement Survey, to assess whether 
work and volunteering moderate the association between 
chronic conditions and subsequent functional limitations.
Background
Successful Aging 1.0
According to the original successful aging model, central 
aspects of aging “better than usual” include (i) low rates 
and risks of disease, (ii) high levels of physical and cog-
nitive functioning, and (iii) engagement in productive 
activities (Rowe & Kahn, 1997). First, disease is relatively 
prevalent among older people in the United States. For 
example, according to the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, among people older than 65 years in 2013, 
30% suffered from heart disease, 18% suffered from can-
cer, and 8% had a stroke (Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, 2014). Moreover, chronic conditions represent 
several of the leading causes of death in the United States 
(Johnson, Hayes, Brown, Hoo, & Ethier, 2014). Therefore, 
those with low rates of disease are likely to not only be 
healthier but also have lower risk of early mortality.
Second, in terms of physical functioning, nearly 20% 
of men and 30% of women older than 65 years in the 
United States experience from some form of functional 
limitation (Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related 
Statistics, 2012). Moreover, being disabled exacerbates 
the risk of mortality due to chronic conditions (Forman-
Hoffman et al., 2015). In addition to increasing the risk 
of death, being disabled increases health care costs, both 
for individuals and through public programs like Medicare 
and Medicaid (Anderson, Wiener, Finkelstein, & Armour, 
2011; Chan et al., 2002). Thus, identifying ways to limit 
disability is important to help reduce excess mortality in 
the U.S. population, as well as individual and public health 
expenditures, and is clearly central in successful aging.
Finally, two important forms of productive activities 
include paid employment and unpaid volunteering. Both 
paid employment and unpaid volunteering have been 
linked to better health, lower risks of depression, and lower 
risks of mortality (Li & Ferraro, 2005; Luoh & Herzog, 
2002; Morrow-Howell, Hinterlong, Rozario, & Tang, 
2003). Therefore, being engaged in productive activities is 
key to one’s ability to age “better than usual.”
Successful Aging 
Through the Lens of the 
Disablement Process
Like the successful aging model, the disablement process 
model emphasizes both disease and physical function-
ing. The disablement processes model, however, specifies 
a particular temporal arrangement between disease and 
physical functioning. According to the disablement process 
model, disability begins with diseases—frequently meas-
ured as chronic health conditions—that elevate the risk for 
“restrictions in performing fundamental physical activi-
ties” (i.e., functional limitations; Lawrence & Jette, 1996; 
Verbrugge & Jette, 1994). Functional limitations, in turn, 
subsequently elevate the risk for activities of daily living 
limitations which, in turn, increases the risk of mortality 
(Clarke & George, 2005; Kempen et al., 1999). Although 
mortality represents the final stage of the disablement pro-
cess, the pathway from chronic conditions to functional 
limitations is particularly important as it represents “a 
crucial intermediary stage [in the disablement process] and 
should be a focus of intervention strategies” (Lawrence & 
Jette, 1996), and it is likely at this “intermediary stage” that 
productive engagement may play a central role in the disa-
blement process.
On one hand, productive engagement is frequently 
linked to disablement outcomes. For instance, among peo-
ple aged 70 and older, both working and volunteering are 
associated with the odds of experiencing functional limi-
tation and mortality (Luoh & Herzog, 2002). Similarly, 
number of hours of volunteering is associated with fewer 
activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily 
living (Lum & Lightfoot, 2005). Additionally, any level of 
work is associated with lower levels of functional limita-
tions when compared with full retirement (Zhan, Wang, 
Liu, & Shultz, 2009). Clearly, it appears that remaining pro-
ductively engaged is associated with disablement outcomes.
On the other hand, however, the role that productive 
engagement plays in the early disablement process is yet 
to be understood. That is, the disablement process model 
specifies that certain contextual factors may attenuate or 
exacerbate the extent to which chronic conditions may 
influence subsequent functional limitations (Braungart 
Fauth, Zarit, Malmberg, & Johansson, 2007; Verbrugge & 
Jette, 1994). For instance, both lifestyle and participation in 
activities are thought to be “intra-individual factors” that 
may shape the extent to which chronic conditions expose 
people to risks of functional limitations (Verbrugge & Jette, 
341
Journals of Gerontology: SOCIAL SCIENCES, 2017

Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article-abstract/72/2/340/2631878 by guest on 03 June 2019
 1994). In this context, however, it is heretofore unclear how 
engagement in productive activities such as work and vol-
unteering moderates the association between chronic con-
ditions and functional limitations.
What is becoming increasingly clear, however, is that 
certain factors may attenuate the progression toward disa-
blement. For instance, the influence of suffering from a new 
chronic condition on activities of daily living limitations is 
smaller among those with high levels of psychosocial resil-
ience (Manning, Carr, & Kail, 2014). Similarly, engaging 
in physical exercises helps mitigate some of the associa-
tion between heart disease and disability (Wang, Van Belle, 
Kukull, & Larson, 2002). Finally, the influence of chronic 
conditions on subsequent level of functional limitations is 
smaller among those who are married (relative to the unmar-
ried) (B. Kail, 2015). Therefore, based on empirical evidence 
and theoretical insights from the successful aging and disa-
blement models, we developed the following two hypotheses:
H1:  
Compared to non-workers, the influence of chronic 
conditions on subsequent functional limitations will 
be lower among those who are currently working.
H2:  
Compared to non-volunteers, the influence of chronic 
conditions on subsequent functional limitations will 
be lower among those who are currently volunteering.
Selection
In the context of the disablement process, it is important 
to consider the possible ways productive engagement may 
relate to the relationship between chronic conditions and 
functional limitations. The previous section highlights the 
way in which productive activities like work and volun-
teering may act as potential interventions in the process 
wherein chronic conditions are translated into functional 
limitations. However, it is equally plausible that the ability 
to remain productively engaged may be contingent upon 
(a) whether one has one or more chronic conditions and (b) 
the presence of pre-existing functional limitations. In the 
context of working, this has been referred to as “the healthy 
worker bias,” wherein health predicts both work status and 
the health outcome of interest (Hernán, Hernández-Díaz, & 
 
Robins, 2004), and in the context of volunteering, this has 
been referred to as “the volunteer elite bias” (Li & Ferraro, 
2005). The implications of these biases are that by fail-
ing to account for selection, it may appear that produc-
tive engagement influences functional limitations, when, in 
fact, this association is merely the expression of chronic 
conditions and prior levels of functional limitations being 
predictive of both participating in productive activities and 
subsequent functional limitations.
Indeed, chronic conditions impair people’s ability to work 
and predict volunteering among adults (Kessler, Greenberg, 
Mickelson, Meneades, & Wang, 2001; Tang, 2006). 
Similarly, although some people may choose to engage in 
work and volunteering to help delay or avoid loss of physical 
functioning, functional limitations are also associated with 
lower odds of volunteering, and people with functional limi-
tations are much less likely to be employed (Brault, 2012; Li 
& Ferraro, 2005). Therefore, to truly elucidate the moderat-
ing role productive engagement plays in the disablement pro-
cess, it is essential that analyses take into account that people 
may be selecting into or out of productive engagement roles 
on the basis of the extent to which they have chronic condi-
tions and pre-existing functional limitations. To that end, we 
develop a third and final hypothesis:
H3:  
Failure to account for the relationships between 
chronic conditions and pre-existing functional limi-
tations with whether or not people engage in work 
and volunteering will lead to overestimates of the 
moderating influence of work and volunteering on 
the association between chronic conditions and sub-
sequent functional limitations.
Data and Method
The data for this project come from the 1998–2012 waves 
of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). The HRS began 
collecting data on people older than 50 and younger than 62 
in 1992 (and their spouses) and re-interviewed them every 
2 years, with new cohorts being added to the sample in 1998, 
2004, and 2010 (Health and Retirement Study, 2010; Juster & 
Suzman, 1995; RAND Center for the Study of Aging, 2014).
For the research presented here, the sample was limited 
in two primary waves. First, the sample excludes the waves 
prior to 1998 because of inconsistencies in the measure-
ment of the items making up the functional limitation 
measures and because the HRS became nationally repre-
sentative of Americans older than 50 years in 1998 (RAND 
Center for the Study of Aging, 2014). Second, the sample is 
limited to people between the ages of 51 and 64 years; the 
lower age represents the threshold for age eligibility into 
the HRS sample and the latter represents the traditional 
age of retirement in the United States. The final sample 
included 42,685 person waves nested with 13,268 people.
Dependent Variable
The primary dependent variable for the following analysis is 
subsequent functional limitations. This is a composite measure 
representing the sum of six items: walking one block, climbing 
one flight of stairs, stooping or kneeling, lifting or carrying 10 
lbs, picking a dime up off the ground, and pushing or pulling 
a large object. Each of the original items was dichotomously 
coded with “1” indicating difficulty doing that particular task 
(RAND Center for the Study of Aging, 2014).
Independent Variables
There are two sets of key study variables in the follow-
ing analyses. First, chronic conditions were measured as

 the sum of seven items indicating whether the respondent 
had ever been diagnosed with each of the following condi-
tions: high blood pressure; diabetes, cancer; lung disease; 
heart problems; stroke; or arthritis. Because the associa-
tion between chronic conditions and health outcomes may 
be contingent upon the number of chronic conditions from 
which one suffers, we also test a nonlinear transformation 
of chronic conditions and include the number of chronic 
conditions squared in our models.
Second, two sets of indicators of productive engage-
ment were used in the following analyses. First, working 
was measured with three dichotomous indicators: people 
were coded as in full-time work if they reported working 
35 or more hours per week and 36 or more weeks over 
the previous year; people were coded as in part-time work 
if they reported working but did not meet the conditions 
for full-time work; and people were coded as nonworkers 
if they did not report working the previous year (Maestas, 
2010). Second, volunteering was also measured with three 
dichotomous indicators: people who were not volunteers, 
people who volunteered less than 100 hours over the pre-
vious 12 months, and people who volunteered more than 
100 hours over the previous 12 months. We experimented 
with other categorical configurations of volunteering, but 
model fit statistics indicated this was the best fit given our 
data.
Control Variables
In addition to our study variables, we control for several 
demographic controls, as well as several known correlates 
of functional limitations. Five time-invariant control vari-
ables were used in the following analyses. Race was meas-
ured with three dichotomous indicators: White, Black, and 
“other” race, and Hispanic ethnicity was measured with 
a dichotomous variable indicating that the respondent 
reported that they consider themselves Hispanic or Latino. 
Gender was measured with a dichotomous indicator coded 
“1” for men. Education was measured as the number of 
years of education (up to 17 years of education). Finally, we 
include a dichotomous measure of mortality, which indi-
cates whether someone died and exited our sample during 
the period of observation.
Additionally, nine time-varying control variables were 
used in the following analyses. Age was measured in years. 
Current marital status was measured dichotomously, coded 
“1” for people who were currently married. Current func-
tional limitations were measured identically as the outcome 
variable with the exception that “current” is measured in 
the same wave as all of the other time-varying variables, 
whereas “subsequent” is measured in the next wave. We 
also account for an indicator of whether the respondent 
reported experiencing pain that limits activities (Covinsky, 
Lindquist, Dunlop, & Yelin, 2009). Depressive symptoms 
were measured as a composite indicator of the sum of eight 
items indicating having one of the following symptoms: 
felt depressed; everything was an effort; sleep was restless; 
was happy (reverse coded); felt lonely; felt sad; could not 
get going; and enjoyed life (reverse coded). These items 
are a shortened version of the Center for Epidemiologic 
Studies—Depression index (Radloff, 1977). Body mass 
index (BMI) was measured as the respondent’s weight in 
kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. Because 
the association between BMI and functional limitations is 
nonlinear (Ferraro & Booth, 1999), we also included a 
measure of BMI squared in primary analyses. Self-assessed 
health was measured as a 5-point Likert item, ranging from 
1 (poor health) to 5 (excellent health). Financial well-being 
was measured by two variables: household income and 
household wealth, which were converted using the inverse 
hyperbolic sine function to adjust for skewness, zero val-
ues (for both income and wealth), and negative values (for 
wealth) (Burbidge, Magee, & Robb, 1988; Gale & Pence, 
2006). Among the people in the sample, 11.9% were miss-
ing information on one or more of the control variables. 
To adjust for this, Stata’s mi impute commands were used 
to create three data sets, and results were averaged across 
those data sets following procedures described here by 
Rubin (1987) and Allison (2009).
Analysis Plan
Because chronic conditions and current functional limita-
tions may predict whether one participates in paid employ-
ment or unpaid volunteering, a two-step Heckit procedure 
(Guo & Fraser, 2014) was used for the following analyses. 
For the first-stage selection equations, a series of multino-
mial models were run on each categorical outcome: work 
status (nonwork, part-time work, and full-time work) and 
volunteer status (nonvolunteer, volunteer < 100 hours, and 
volunteer ≥100 hours). These models were estimated using 
all of the study variables and control variables listed earlier. 
Additionally, the Heckit procedure requires that each first-
stage model includes an exclusion restriction—that is, a 
variable that is a significant predictor of the outcome in the 
first-stage equation, but is not a significant predictor of the 
second-stage equation. To that end, a dichotomous meas-
ure of whether the respondent had life insurance coverage 
was included in the selection equation for current work sta-
tus (coded “1” for people who currently had life insurance 
coverage). Similarly, a variable of whether the respondent 
reported any religious preference (i.e., Protestant, Catholic, 
Jewish, or “other”—coded “1”—relative to “none”—
coded “0”) was included in the selection equations for vol-
unteering (Bushway, Johnson, & Slocum, 2007). Because 
of the panel structure of the data, a multinomial model was 
run for each wave of data for each measure of productive 
engagement. From each of these models, the inverse mill 
ratio was calculated separately for each wave and for each 
category of each multinomial model. In the multinomial 
model, the inverse mills ratio is calculated separately for 
each i category of k categories as

not presented, but are available upon request). These inverse 
mills ratios for each of k − 1 categories for each outcome 
were then included as time-varying covariates in the second-
stage equations to help reduce issues of selection into work 
and volunteering. Finally, because of the panel structure of 
the data, it was also necessary to include a dummy variable 
for each wave (minus the reference category) in the second-
stage equations (as described in Wooldridge, 2002, p. 583).
To help further ensure time order, all of the time-varying 
predictor variables were measured at Wavet, whereas sub-
sequent functional limitations (the outcome variable in the 
primary models) were measured at Wavet+1. Because of the 
panel structure of the data, hierarchical mixed-effects lin-
ear regression models were estimated using the mixed com-
mand in Stata v13 (StataCorp, 2011), which allows for the 
direct estimation of the regression parameters, but accounts 
for unmeasured person-level heterogeneity through the 
upper level (in this case, person level) variance structure.
Sensitivity Analyses
In addition to the models we present here, we estimated a 
variety of sensitivity analyses to verify the robustness of our 
models. First, we experimented with alternative codings of 
chronic conditions. Notably, we experimented with a couple 
of categorical distinctions between a chronic condition and 
multiple chronic conditions. In particular, we followed Ralph, 
Mielenz, Parton, Flatley, and Thorpe (2013) and created a 
dichotomous variable coded “1” for people experiencing two 
or more chronic conditions and coded “0” for people experi-
encing zero or one chronic condition. Although the findings 
were substantively similar to those we present here, both the 
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and Akaike informa-
tion criterion (AIC) fit statistics indicate that the linear and 
squared measures of chronic conditions are more appropriate 
for our data (full results available upon request). We also esti-
mated models excluding the second-order chronic conditions 
term, however, model fit statistics indicate that including the 
squared measure improves model fit.
Results
Univariate and Bivariate Results
As shown in Table 1, the average person in the average 
wave in our sample experienced 1.10 subsequent functional 
limitations and 1.45 chronic conditions. Sixteen percent of 
the sample was working part time and 46% of the sample 
was working full time. Twenty-one percent of the sample 
volunteered for less than 100 hours and 13% volunteered 
for 100 or more hours.
On average, as shown in Table 2, workers experienced 
fewer subsequent functional limitations than nonwork-
ers (0.84 among part-time workers and 0.67 among full-
time workers, compared with 1.72 among nonworkers). 
Workers also had fewer chronic conditions than nonwork-
ers (1.31 among part-time workers and 1.16 among full-
time workers, compared with 1.86 among nonworkers). 
Similarly, as shown in Table 3, volunteers experienced fewer 
subsequent functional limitations than nonvolunteers (0.84 
among volunteers of < 100 hours and 0.78 among volun-
teers of ≥100 hours, compared with 1.25 among nonvolun-
teers). Volunteers also had fewer chronic conditions than 
nonvolunteers (1.29 among volunteers of < 100 hours and 
1.30 among volunteers of ≥100 hours, compared with 1.53 
among nonvolunteers). Finally, both workers and volun-
teers experienced fewer current limitations than their non-
engaged counterparts.

 in Table 4. Because the models include prior levels of 
functional limitations, coefficients may be interpreted as 
changes in functional limitations. Model 1 presents analy-
sis that do not account for selection into work and volun-
teering. In this model, each chronic condition is associated 
with an increase of 0.06 functional limitations, and the 
second-order term indicates that this becomes larger as 
the number of chronic conditions increases. In this model, 
relative to nonworkers, people who are working part time 
experienced 0.12 fewer subsequent functional limitations 
and full-time workers experienced 0.11 fewer subsequent 
functional limitations. Similarly, relative to nonvolunteers, 
people who volunteered less than 100 hours per year expe-
rienced 0.04 fewer subsequent functional limitations, and 
people who volunteered 100 hours or more experienced 
0.06 fewer subsequent functional limitations. Model 2 
replicates Model 1, but accounts for selection via the four 
inverse Mills ratios (i.e., one each for k − 1 categories of 
working—3-1—and one each for k − 1 categories of vol-
unteering—also 3-1) and the wave dummy variables. In 
this model, there are small changes in the associations 
between chronic conditions, working, and volunteering 
with subsequent functional limitations, but the changes to 
the magnitudes of the coefficients are all less than 0.01. 
Nevertheless, model fit indices indicate that including 
the selection parameters results in better fit for the data. 
(Although not shown, sensitivity analyses were conducted 
to verify that the inclusion of chronic conditions, as well 
as working, and volunteering resulted in improved model 
fit. In each instance, the AIC and BIC supported including 
these variables in the model; results available upon request).
In Model 3, the interactions between working and 
chronic conditions were added to the equation from which 
Model 2 was estimated. In this model, the direct effect of 
chronic conditions on subsequent functional limitations 
increased overall, but there were significant interactions 
between chronic conditions and work status. Specifically, 
although each chronic condition was associated with an 
increase in 0.13 functional limitations for nonworkers, this 
effect was about 0.08 smaller for both part-time workers 
and full-time workers (a reduction of more than half).
In Model 4, the interactions between volunteering and 
chronic conditions were added to the equation from which 
Model 2 was estimated. As was the case for the model of

 workers versus nonworkers, in this model, the direct effect 
of chronic conditions on subsequent functional limitations 
was associated with a 0.10 increase in functional limita-
tions for nonvolunteers. For people who volunteer at less 
than 100 hours per year, the impact of chronic conditions 
was less than for nonvolunteers—however, the significant 
interaction with the second-order terms indicates that this 
attenuating effect begins to wane as the number of chronic 
conditions increases. It is notable that (a) there was no 
significant interaction between number of chronic condi-
tions and volunteering more than 100 hours per year in this 
model and (b) the direct effect of volunteering more than 
100 hours or more per year was nonsignificant. However, 
in additional models (not shown, but available upon 
request) when Model 4 was re-estimated excluding the two 
noninteraction terms involving volunteering more than 100 
hours per year, the direct effect of volunteering 100 hours 
or more per year was again significant and twice the magni-
tude of volunteering less than 100 hours. This suggests that 
although volunteering 100 hours or more does not moder-
ate the association between chronic conditions and subse-
quent functional limitations, it is nevertheless important in 
limiting functional limitations.
In Model 5, the interactions between both measures 
of chronic conditions and both measures of productive 
engagement are included at the same time. In this model, 
it becomes apparent that both working full time and part 
time and volunteering less than 100 hours per year are 
significant moderators in the association between chronic 
conditions and functional limitations.
In addition to the models presented in Table 4, several 
additional models were estimated to assess the conditional 
relationship between productive activities and functional 
limitations (not shown, but available upon request). First, 
because the categories of work and volunteering were not 
mutually exclusive, we estimated models that included 
interactions between each of the work variables with each 
of the volunteering models. None of these were significant, 
suggesting that the relationship between work and subse-
quent functional limitations and between volunteering and 
subsequent functional limitations is not contingent upon 
whether someone is also engaged in the other form of pro-
ductive engagement. Second, to assess whether the associa-
tion between work and subsequent functional limitations 
was conditional on socioeconomic status, we estimated 
models including two sets of three additional interactions:

 there were no significant interactions. Thus, the moderating 
impact of work on subsequent functional limitations does 
not appear to be conditional upon socioeconomic status.
Discussion
Using the 1998–2012 waves of the Health and Retirement 
Study, as well as insights from the successful aging and the 
disablement process models, we sought to assess whether 
work and volunteering moderated the association between 
chronic conditions and subsequent functional limitations. 
Results indicated that the association between chronic con-
ditions and subsequent functional limitations was smaller 
among workers and among people volunteering less than 
100 hours per year. These findings provide several impor-
tant insights and a conceptual expansion of successful 
aging models.
Our first hypothesis—that compared to non-workers, 
the influence of chronic conditions on subsequent func-
tional limitations would be lower among those who are 
currently working (H1)—was supported. We found that not 
only do workers have lower levels of subsequent functional 
limitations than nonworkers (net of selection into work-
ing), the influence of chronic conditions on functional limi-
tations was smaller for workers than for nonworkers.
Our second hypothesis—that compared to non-volun-
teers, the influence of chronic conditions on subsequent 
functional limitations would be lower among those who are 
currently volunteering (H2)—was only partially supported. 
As was the case for workers, we found that volunteers also 
have lower levels of subsequent functional limitations than 
nonvolunteers (net of selection into volunteering) and the 
direct benefit of volunteering on subsequent functional 
limitations is larger among people who volunteer more 
(in this case, measured as 100 hours or more per year). 
However, the influence of chronic conditions on functional 
limitations was smaller for people who volunteered for less 
than 100 hours per year, but not for people who volun-
teered 100 or more hours per year. One interpretation of 
this counterintuitive finding, however, is that the benefit of 
larger doses of volunteering is so potent that it is equally 
influential across all levels of chronic conditions. This find-
ing is also consistent with research that finds that “low 
levels of volunteering lead to positive outcomes” (Morrow-
Howell et al., 2003). Taken together, this suggests that for 
those “lacking in meaningful engagement” (Rowe & Kahn, 
2015) via work and volunteering, the risks of increased 
functional limitations are exacerbated—both directly and, 
in general, indirectly through chronic conditions.
Our third hypothesis—that failure to account for the 
relationships between chronic conditions and pre-existing 
functional limitations with whether or not people engage in 
work and volunteering would lead to overestimates of the 
moderating influence of work and volunteering on the asso-
ciation between chronic conditions and subsequent func-
tional limitations (H3)—had limited support. On one hand, 
the results suggest that selection into work and volunteer-
ing is in fact taking place and accounting for this selection 
resulted in improved model fit. On the other hand, how-
ever, accounting for this selection has only modest impact 
on the primary study variables. This suggests that although 
(a) it is important to consider whether selection is biasing 
estimates regarding health processes, (b) when it comes to 
productive engagement and functional limitations, most of 
the association is through the direct pathways from pro-
ductive activities, rather than from the indirect pathways 
involving prior health.
The current research extends recent scholarship on 
moderating factors in the disablement process (e.g., Kail, 
2016; Manning et al., 2014) by focusing on the role pro-
ductive engagement as potential moderators in the associa-
tion between chronic conditions and subsequent functional 
limitations. However, there are numerous other potential 
moderators that may influence the association between 
chronic conditions and subsequent functional limitations. 
Examples include neighborhood factors, social relation-
ships, religious attendance, additional psychosocial factors, 
injury, and use of mobility devices. Future research should 
consider these—and other social and contextual factors—
as potential moderators in the context of the disablement 
process model.
One important limitation of the current study is that, 
although we adjust for pain, we cannot adjust for severity 
of chronic conditions. A second limitation is that, although 
we estimated interactions between work and socioeconomic 
status, we look at work on average and do not separate 
work into different occupational categories or conditions 
of employment. We hope that future research will extend 
the study done here and consider the ways in which our 
findings vary (a) by severity of chronic conditions and (b) 
occupational differences.
Successful Aging 2.0
In their recent articulation of what they refer to as 
“Successful Aging 2.0,” Rowe and Kahn (2015) argue 
that “the life course perspective urges the identification of 
opportunities for creating new roles and responsibilities for 
older adults.” (For strengths and critiques of the success-
ful aging paradigm, please refer to the above article as well 
as Volume 55 Issue 1 of The Gerontologist) The research 
presented here generally supports this proposition and sug-
gests that social intuitions that create opportunities for both 
work and volunteering may be beneficial for the health of 
older Americans—particularly those with chronic condi-
tions. For instance, in the United States, some states pro-
vide paid leave under their Family and Medical Leave Act 
provisions, whereas others stick to the federal minimum of 
unpaid leave (Fass, 2009). Without paid leave, many older 
workers—particularly women—are not able to continue 
working with the addition of a new care giving responsi-
bility. Alternatively, states with minimum wages set higher

 than the federal standard may provide additional incentive 
for older workers to continue working in a part-time capac-
ity after they exit full-time career employment. To that end, 
inasmuch as the social institutions shaping work and vol-
unteer behavior vary by state, we encourage future research 
to leverage this state variation to directly assess the possi-
bility that the landscape of work and volunteering may be 
impacted by institutional decisions in such a way that leads 
to salubrious health outcomes (or deleterious health out-
comes, depending on the shape of these institutions).
One contribution of the research presented here toward 
successful aging research is that it represents a conceptual 
expansion of the successful aging model. Rather than focus 
on the role of productive engagement on health outcomes, 
we focus on the role of productive engagement on a health 
process—in this case as an intervention in the early stages 
of the disablement process model. To that end, we encour-
age similar research to assess the three key elements of suc-
cessful aging—low levels of disease, high levels of mental 
and physical functioning, and productive activities—and 
consider their relationships to other health processes. For 
example, it would be useful for future researchers to con-
sider how high levels of cognitive functioning attenuate the 
association between chronic conditions and functional lim-
itations, or the association between disability and mortality.
Conclusion
Taken together, these results provide compelling evidence 
that facilitating opportunities for continued productive 
engagement has the potential to help mitigate some of the 
negative impact of chronic conditions on levels of functional 
limitations among people aged 50 to 64 years in the United 
States. Our results on adults nearing the age of retirement are 
in concert with Rowe and Kahn’s (2015) assertion that “late 
in life, many people would welcome increased opportunities 
for age-appropriate paid employment as well as volunteer-
ing”—particularly to the extent that these forms of produc-
tive engagement may foster functional mobility as people 
continue to age. Our research suggests that efforts that suc-
cessfully increase productive engagement in later life should 
be recognized as public health interventions. It is important 
for policymakers to support social institutional structures 
that foster productive engagement in later life, with incen-
tives that encourage those who are healthy enough to work 
and volunteer to remain engaged in those activities as they 
approach the traditional ages of retirement.
