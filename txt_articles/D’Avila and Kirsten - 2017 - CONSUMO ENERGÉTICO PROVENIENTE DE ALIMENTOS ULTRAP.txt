 Objective: To evaluate the consumption of ultra-processed foods 
and related factors in adolescents.
Methods: This is a cross-sectional study conducted with 784 
adolescents (both sexes and aged between 12 and 19 years) 
from public and private schools in the municipality of Palmeira 
das Missões, Brazil. Food consumption was recorded by the 
semiquantitative questionnaire of frequency of food consumption 
and converted to energy (kcal/day). Foods were classified as 
minimally processed, group 1 (G1); processed foods, group 2 
(G2); and ultra-processed foods, group 3 (G3). The variables 
evaluated were sex, socioeconomic class, color, physical activity, 
body mass index, and blood pressure levels. In the comparison of 
quantitative variables, the Mann–Whitney test and the Kruskal–
Wallis H test were used. To adjust the differences between the 
groups, considering the effects of total calories, the covariance 
analysis test (ANCOVA) was applied.
Results: The median of the total energy consumption was 
3,039.8 kcal, and that of ultra-processed foods was 1,496.5 kcal/day 
(49.23%). The caloric intake from foods in G1, G2, and G3 did 
not differ according to the skin color of the adolescents. Those 
belonging to socioeconomic classes C and D are the most frequent 
consumers of calories from G2 and G3 (p<0.001). Underactive 
teens consume fewer calories from minimally processed foods. 
Eutrophic adolescents present higher consumption of G3 foods 
(p<0.001) when compared to those who are overweight.
Conclusions: The consumption of ultra-processed foods was 
associated with socioeconomic level, physical activity level, and 
nutritional status.

IntroductIon
In Latin America, dietary patterns have undergone profound 
changes in recent years. In Brazil, for example, between 2002–
2003 and 2008–2009, there was an increase in the availability 
of ready-to-eat products (23–27.8% of calories), as a result of 
the increase in consumption of ultra-processed products (from 
20.8% to 25.4%) in all income classes. During this period, 
there was a significant decrease in consumption of minimally 
processed foods and cooking ingredients.1
The feeling of not having enough time is related to changes 
in food consumption patterns, such as reduced time spent pre-
paring food at home, increased consumption of ready-to-eat 
foods, and decreased food consumption in the whole fam-
ily.2,3 This type of foods, often cheaper than fresh foods, offer 
highly energetic and palatable meals1 and are associated with 
less healthy diets, contributing to the emergence of obesity and 
chronic health problems.3
In order to describe dietary patterns and to identify how 
they may affect health, Monteiro et al.4 propose a new classifi-
cation covering three groups according to the extent and pur-
pose of the treatment used in their production: group 1 con-
sists of unprocessed and minimally processed foods; group 2, 
for processed foods or foods that serve as culinary ingredients; 
group 3 involves ultra-processed, ready-to-eat or frozen food 
with little or no preparation. It is important to emphasize that 
a diet made only with products of the third group is twice as 
dense in energy when compared to the diet prepared with food 
from the other groups.5
The change in the dietary profile of the population did not 
occur only in adults.6 However, few studies have shown the 
relationship of excess weight and metabolic changes5 with high 
ingestion of ultra-processed foods.4,7 These foods are generally 
more sugary, salty, fatty, with a high glycemic load, and dense 
energy when compared to freshly prepared foods, meals, and 
dishes made with unprocessed or minimally processed foods 
and cooking ingredients.5,8
Thus, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the caloric 
intake from ultra-processed foods and verify their association 
with socioeconomic factors, nutritional status, level of physi-
cal activity, and blood pressure levels.
Methods
This is a cross-sectional study carried out from September 2013 
to October 2014 in Palmeira das Missões (RS), a country town 
located in the northwest of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, 
with residents belonging to various ethnic groups and a cur-
rent population of 34,328 inhabitants. The sector that drives 
the local economy is agriculture and livestock. Palmeira das 
Missões presents a human development index (HDI) of 0.737, 
according to data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography 
and Statistics (IBGE) of 2010.9
The sample was considered as non-probabilistic (conve-
nience), with the participation of 784 adolescents, out of a 
total of 1,317 enrolled (representing approximately 60% of 
the studied population), from all schools (public and private) 
located in the central region of the municipality. By performing 
a sample calculation a posteriori, the sample size recommen-
dation of 710 students was obtained, taking into account the 
population of 1,317 students enrolled, an estimated sample 
error of 2.5%, a 95% confidence level, and a more homoge-
neous profile of population distribution. The inclusion cri-
terion of the schools was the presence of 8th grade and high 
school classes. As a criterion for the inclusion of adolescents, 
those who were in 8th grade of elementary school and the 
3rd year of high school were considered, including students 
and parents/guardians who expressed their consent to the 
participation of adolescents in the study. Students who were 
not present on the days of data collection and those who 
refused to be part of the investigation were considered as 
losses. Pregnant women, students with dwarfism, exchange 
students, students with bone fractures, and those with hear-
ing problems were excluded.
To determine the regular food consumption of adolescents, 
a semiquantitative food consumption frequency questionnaire 
(QFCA) was elaborated for adolescents from the metropolitan 
region of Rio de Janeiro, with 90 items.10 With the application 
of the pilot test, we noticed the need to remove some non-tra-
ditional foods from this population, such as croissant, and to 
change the terminology of some foods, such as hamburgers 
(not traditional in the state of Rio Grande do Sul). Also, the 
age group that comprised the QFCA was more clearly delin-
eated, excluding students from school years below the 8th grade. 
The frequency records of food consumption in the QFCA were 
converted to energy (kcal/day) consumed, using the Brazilian 
Food Composition Table.11 For the foods that were not found 
in the mentioned table, the Nutritional Composition Table 
of Foods Consumed in Brazil was used.12 Also, for foods not 
found (cheese salad burgers, instant soup, industrialized juice 
box/package/bottle) in none of the tables cited, nutritional 
information were taken from labels searched on the internet.
For data analysis, 174 students were excluded, for whom 
the energy consumption was higher than 6,000 kcal or less than 
500 kcal.13 The variables evaluated were sex, socioeconomic 
class, self-reported skin color, physical activity level, body mass 
index (BMI), and blood pressure levels.
Foods were classified into three groups, according to 
the level of processing.14 Group 1 (G1) was represented by 
 Ultra-processed foods and adolescents

unprocessed or minimally processed foods, such as fresh 
meat, milk, cereals, fruits, and vegetables. Group 2 (G2) was 
composed of processed foods used as ingredients of culinary 
preparations, such as oils and fats, flours, pasta, starch, and 
sugars. Group 3 (G3) consists of ultra-processed foods, such 
as breads, biscuits, ice creams, chocolates, candies/sweets, 
snacks, potato chips, sweetened drinks such as sodas, as 
well as meat products such as nuggets, hot dogs, burgers, 
and luncheon meats.
Self-reported information on sex and skin color (white, 
brown, and black) was collected by means of a questionnaire. 
Students who declared themselves to be Asian (0.4%) and indig-
enous (1.6%) were excluded from the statistical analysis because 
of their low percentage. For statistical purposes, blacks and 
browns were analyzed together in the elaborated comparisons.
The socioeconomic classification followed the criteria of 
the Brazilian Association of Research Companies (Abep) and 
was presented in classes, named A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2, D, 
and E, corresponding respectively to a given score.15 For data 
analysis, classes A1 and A2, B1 and B2, C1 and C2, and D 
were grouped together.
The level of physical activity was evaluated using the crite-
ria and grouping in categories proposed by the International 
Physical Activity Questionnaire (Ipaq). This questionnaire 
was reproduced and validated for Brazilian adolescents16 and 
classifies the sample into three categories: insufficiently active, 
sufficiently active, and very active.
To evaluate the nutritional status by means of BMI, the 
World Health Organization’s recommendation was followed,17 
and all anthropometric measurements were performed in dupli-
cate. Data collected were birth date, weight (kg), and height 
(cm). The BMI was calculated using the WHO AnthroPlus 
software (version 3.2.2)18 and the nutritional status classifi-
cation was calculated according to the BMI percentiles for 
age and sex.19 Adolescents were considered overweight/obese 
when the percentile was greater than or equal to 85, and 
non-obese when the percentile was below 85. A prevalence 
of 2.9% of adolescents with low weight was found. For sta-
tistical purposes, such individuals were grouped with eutro-
phic adolescents.
Pressure levels were measured using duly calibrated auto-
matic equipment Omron 705 CP-II, which proved to be valid 
for the measurement of young individuals, according to a study 
performed with a Brazilian population.12 Two consecutive read-
ings were recorded at 2-minute intervals, using the second for 
classification. This followed values referring to the 90th, 95th, 
and 99th percentile of blood pressure levels for adolescents, 
according to age, sex, and percentiles of height of those evalu-
ated. Values below the 90th percentile were considered normal; 
values between the 90th and 95th percentile, borderline; values 
equal to or above the 95th percentile were defined as increased.
This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee 
of Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM) under proto-
col number 19984713.1.0000.
The data were analyzed using statistical software 
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 
18.0. Quantitative data were described by mean ± standard 
deviation and categorical data, by percentage. In the pres-
ence of asymmetry, median and interquartile range were 
used. The asymmetry of the variables was tested using the 
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. In the comparison of quantita-
tive variables, the Mann–Whitney test and Kruskal–Wallis H 
test were used. To adjust the differences between the groups, 
taking into account the effects of total calories, the covari-
ance analysis test (ANCOVA) was used. Statistically signif-
icant values were considered when p<0.05.
results
The sample consisted of 784 adolescents with a mean age of 
15.25±1.26 years. The female sex constituted 57.4% (n=450) 
of the sample. Students belonging to the socioeconomic class 
B1 and B2 represented 60.1% (n=463) of the sample, and the 
white color was self-declared by 62.4% (n=471) of partici-
pants. Most of the sample was considered very physically active 
(57.4%, n=450), with normal pressure levels (75%, n=560), 
and eutrophic (76.6%, n=573). The median of total energy con-
sumption was 3,039.8 kcal and that of ultra-processed foods 
was 1,496.5 kcal/day, representing 49.2% (Table 1).
Adolescents who declared themselves to be brown or 
black (analyzed together) consumed more calories from G1 
(p=0.021) and G3 (p=0.045), when compared to white adoles-
cents. However, after adjusting for total calories, the difference 
lost significance (data not shown). Adolescents belonging to 
classes C and D consumed more products from G2 (p<0.001) 
and G3 (p<0.001), compared to those belonging to classes A 
and B (Table 2). In the comparison of the energy consump-
tion coming from the groups (G1, G2, and G3) according to 
the sex of the adolescents, there was no statistical difference 
(data not shown).
Table 3 shows that insufficiently active adolescents con-
sumed less energy from minimally processed foods compared 
to those who were sufficiently active and very active. No dif-
ference was observed in the other groups (G2 and G3) with 
respect to physical activity. It was also verified that eutrophic 
adolescents presented higher consumption of ultra-processed 
foods (p<0.001), when compared to adolescents who were over-
weight (Table 4). There was no association of food consumption

in view of its degree of processing with blood pressure levels 
(data not shown).
dIscussIon
This study found that adolescents, even from small, country-
side towns, present high energy consumption from ultra-pro-
cessed foods, and this consumption was associated with socio-
economic class, physical activity level, and nutritional status.
Food processing is a much debated issue today. Most stud-
ies20-24 use the terminology “fast food” for industrialized foods, 
but Monteiro et al.4 created a new classification of foods into 
three groups, in line with the level of processing, with the third 
group comprising foods that have been processed, those that 
require little or no preparation. The new Food Guide for the 
Brazilian population25 proposes a classification similar to that 
of Monteiro et al.,4 with the same terminology, differing only 
on breads and baked foods. Monteiro et al.4 consider breads as 
ultra-processed when, in addition to wheat flour, yeast, water, 
and salt, ingredients include substances such as hydrogenated 
vegetable fat, sugar, starch, whey, emulsifiers, and other additives.
The energy consumption from ultra-processed foods 
in this study was extremely high, as the food guide25 esti-
mates that an average of 2,000 calories will be enough to 
younger people. However, Andrade et al.,10 when analyzed 
overweight and non-overweight adolescents aged between 
12 and 17.9 years, also reported high intakes of foods with 
high energy density in adolescents in Rio de Janeiro. On the 
other hand, the study by Canella et al.26 verified low fam-
ily consumption of these foods when using the analysis of 
food availability as a research tool. An investigation car-
ried out with children assisted at the Basic Health Unit of 
Porto Alegre found a value similar to this study, with 47% 
of the calories coming from ultra-processed foods.27 The first 
recently published study with adults and adolescents28 found

that the sample consumed approximately 30% of the cal-
ories from ultra-processed foods; however, this evaluation 
was not conducted separately, according to the age group. 
Evaluating the dietary intake of the Brazilian diet using the 
Family Budgets Survey, a slightly lower calorie value was 
found from ultra-processed foods (21.5%).29
Adolescents belonging to socioeconomic classes C and D in 
this study were the largest consumers of calories from processed 
(G2) and ultra-processed (G3) foods. Corroborating with the 
present study, in which the poorest participants consume more 
ultra-processed calories, Miqueleiz et al.30 studied the associa-
tion between socioeconomic class and consumption in Spanish 
families and obtained an inverse gradient: children and ado-
lescents from high and low socioeconomic strata, respectively, 
presented the lowest and highest percentage of unhealthy con-
sumption (fast food, sugary drinks, snacks, chips, biscuits). But 
the results of Bielemann et al.31 are opposed to this study, as 
adults who declared themselves to have never been poor pre-
sented higher consumption of ultra-processed foods.
Fruits and vegetables found in G1 have less energy and are 
high in fiber, essential nutrients, and minerals. Therefore, their 
consumption can benefit health by reducing the total energy 
content of the diet, improving its nutrient density.32

Galvez et al.33 found that children living in a small area 
with one or more convenience stores were more likely to have 
a higher BMI. The adolescents in this study reside in a coun-
tryside town of Southern Brazil without fast-food chains. 
Limited access to this type of food, and the fact that the sam-
ple presents a high prevalence of physical activity, is perhaps 
the explanation for the inverse association between ultra-pro-
cessed calories and BMI.
Some studies have shown an association of consumption of 
ultra-processed foods with overweight and obesity in adults,26 
with metabolic syndrome in adolescents,34 and general and 
central obesity in adult women.35 Furthermore, it was found 
that in adult individuals in Guatemala, the 10% increase in 
the share of highly processed foods increases BMI by 4.25%, 
as well as the probability of excess weight and obesity.36 In stu-
dents aged 12–20 years, strong positive associations were found 
between weight change and consumption of starches, refined 
grains, and processed foods.37 It is worth noting that, of the 
studies cited, many analyzed only some of the foods included 
in the ultra-processed classification.
However, when the same situation is observed in adolescents, 
the association previously described has not been evidenced, as 
reported in this study. According to a research involving Iranian 
 D’Avila HF et al.
59
Rev Paul Pediatr. 2017;35(1):54-60
adolescents, there was no significant association between junk 
food (fast foods and snacks) with obesity and hypertension.38 
In addition, a cohort study conducted in Pelotas (RS) with 
adults showed that obese individuals ingest less calories from 
ultra-processed foods.31
This research may have found no association between the 
consumption of ultra-processed foods and overweight/obesity 
in adolescence, but it is possible that such outcomes appear 
in adulthood, as childhood nutritional events can determine 
changes in anabolic/catabolic systems and induce metabolic 
outcomes at more advanced ages.39 Moreover, the estimate of 
daily energy intake is not well judged when based on food sur-
veys.37 In addition, because it is a cross-sectional study, there 
is a temporal limitation, as obesity itself can change the eating 
habits of adolescents.
The possibility of a calibration bias of QFCA is also nec-
essary to highlight. QFCA may be less accurate for adoles-
cents, as this age group sometimes have difficulties in estimat-
ing portion sizes and food intake.40 Although it is feasible, the 
QFCA makes no distinction between food groups G1, G2, 
and G3, and the reports of intake in times per day, week, or 
month were converted into calories per day for consumption 
analyzes. Therefore, a cohort study is recommended in order 
to improve the understanding of the impact of the consump-
tion of ultra-processed foods in adolescents.
It can be concluded that adolescents, even in small towns 
and in the countryside, present high energy consumption from 
ultra-processed foods and that this consumption is related to socio-
economic class, level of physical activity, and nutritional status.
Ultra-processed foods have abundant television advertis-
ing in programs aimed at reaching adolescents; however, these 
programs rarely show the consequence of the high consump-
tion of this type of food. Therefore, it would be prudent for 
the government to adopt relevant legislations and regulations 
on advertisements and processed foods to change this scenario.
