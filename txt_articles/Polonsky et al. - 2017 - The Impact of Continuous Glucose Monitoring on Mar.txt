Monitoring on Markers of Quality
of Life in Adults With Type 1
Diabetes: Further Findings From
the DIAMOND Randomized
Clinical Trial

OBJECTIVE
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) improves glycemic control, but data are
inconclusive about its influence on quality of life (QOL). We investigated the
impact of 24 weeks of CGM use on QOL in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D)
who use multiple daily insulin injections.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
DIAMOND (Multiple Daily Injections and Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Di-
abetes) was a prospective randomized trial that assessed CGM versus self-
monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) only in 158 adults with poorly controlled
T1D. At baseline and study end, participants completed QOL measures that
assessed overall well-being (WHO-5), health status (EQ-5D-5L), diabetes distress
(DDS), hypoglycemic fear (worry subscale of the HFS-II), and hypoglycemic con-
fidence (HCS). At study end, CGM participants completed the CGM Satisfaction
Survey. Linear regression analyses compared treatment group changes in QOL
outcomes over time. Associations between CGM satisfaction and change in QOL
outcomes and in glycemic control indices were assessed.
RESULTS
The CGM group demonstrated a greater increase in hypoglycemic confidence (P =
0.01) and a greater decrease in diabetes distress (P = 0.01) than the SMBG group.
No significant group differences in well-being, health status, or hypoglycemic fear
were observed. CGM satisfaction was not significantly associated with glycemic
changes but was associated with reductions in diabetes distress (P < 0.001) and
hypoglycemic fear (P = 0.02) and increases in hypoglycemic confidence (P < 0.001)
and well-being (P = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS
CGM contributes to significant improvement in diabetes-specific QOL (i.e., diabe-
tes distress, hypoglycemic confidence) in adults with T1D, but not with QOL mea-
sures not specific to diabetes (i.e., well-being, health status). CGM satisfaction was
associated with most of the QOL outcomes but not with glycemic outcomes.

 Although real-time continuous glucose
monitoring (CGM) has been linked to im-
proved glycemic control in adults with
type 1 diabetes (T1D), the impact on qual-
ity of life (QOL) remains uncertain. In ran-
domized controlled trials, CGM has been
shown to have no significant influence
(1–3) or a small positive influence (4,5)
on measures of diabetes-specific QOL
(e.g., hypoglycemic fear). Similarly, the
impact on non–diabetes-specific QOL
(e.g., overall well-being) in randomized
controlled trials has been observed to be
minimal (5,6) or absent (4). In contrast,
retrospective survey and qualitative inter-
view data suggest that CGM may enhance
aspects of QOL (7–9). The reasons for such
disparate findings are not known, but as
new and future CGM technology deliver
better and more reliable accuracy while
reducing the degree of burden on the
user, QOL benefits may be more fre-
quently observed.
The recently reported randomized
trial Multiple Daily Injections and Con-
tinuous Glucose Monitoring in Diabetes
(DIAMOND) assessed a CGM intervention
(with use of the Dexcom G4 Platinum
CGM Systemwithan enhancedalgorithm;
Dexcom, Inc., San Diego, CA) in 158 adults
with poorly controlled T1D whousedmul-
tiple daily insulin injections (MDI) over a
24-week period (10). This study was the
first large CGM trial to focus on patients
with T1D who used MDI. The trial was
completed by 102 (97%) of 105 patients
in the CGM group and all 53 (100%) in the
control group (who used self-monitoring
of blood glucose [SMBG] only). At 24
weeks, CGM participants demonstrated
significantly greater improvements in
HbA1c, less time at .180 mg/dL, less time
at ,70 mg/dL, and reduced glycemic vari-
ability than control group participants;
CGM use was consistently high over the
24 weeks (93% used it $6 days/week in
the last month of the study).
In the current study, we examined the
QOL measures from the DIAMOND study,
both diabetes specific and non–diabetes
specific, administered to participants at
baseline and at 24 weeks. We hypothe-
sized that this newer generation of CGM
leads to greater improvements in QOL
markers, especially in diabetes-specific
measures (which are known to be more
sensitive to change than non–diabetes-
specific measures), than what occurs in
individuals who use SMBG alone. Such
an outcome seemed probable because
current CGM technology allows the indi-
vidual to accomplish something that is not
possible with SMBG: to quickly recognize
and respond to glucose fluctuations as
needed (and now with devices that are
more reliable and less burdensome),
thereby 1) aiding the individual to regain
or enhance a sense of personal control
over glucose control and, more largely, di-
abetes and 2) as overall glucose control
improves, leading more directly to broad
physical and psychosocial benefits, such as
greater energy, better mood, or an overall
sense of well-being. Therefore, we also ex-
pected that the CGM group would report
broad satisfaction with the device and that
such satisfaction would be associated with
QOL improvement as well as markers of
broad glycemic improvement.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
DIAMOND was a 24-week, two-group
randomized trialconductedat24endocri-
nology practices in the U.S. For the com-
plete study protocol, see the original trial
results (10). Key aspects of the protocol
are summarized below.
Major inclusion criteria were age $25
years, diagnosis of T1D being treated with
MDI for at least 1 year, central laboratory–
measured HbA1c 7.5–10.0%, and no CGM
use in the3monthspretrial. Aftersuccess-
ful completion of a run-in period that
used a CGM device modified so that
glucose values would not be displayed (re-
ferred to as blinded CGM), eligible partic-
ipants were randomly assigned in a 2:1
ratio to either the CGM or control group
(105 and 53, respectively).
Participants in both the CGM and con-
trol groups received a Bayer Contour Next
USB meter and test strips. Participants in
the CGM group were provided with a
Dexcom G4 Platinum CGM and were in-
structed to use the CGM daily, calibrate
the CGM twice daily, and verify the CGM
glucose concentration with their meter be-
fore making diabetes management deci-
sions. Participants in the control group
were asked to perform home blood glu-
cose monitoring with the study meter at
least four times daily. Follow-up visits for
both treatment groups occurred after 4,
12, and 24 weeks. The CGM group had an
additionalvisit 1week afterrandomization.
The control group had two additional visits
1weekbeforethe12-and24-weekvisitsto
initiate blinded CGMusefor1 week. Phone
contacts for both groups occurred 2 and
3 weeks after randomization.
The psychosocial self-report measures
werecompletedbyallparticipantsatbase-
line and again at study end (24 weeks).
HbA1cwasmeasuredatbaseline,12weeks,
and 24 weeks at a central laboratory. At
the same three time points, a series of
other glycemic measures was assessed
through CGM (blinded in the control
group,unblindedintheCGMgroup);these
included the percentage of time per day in
the target range (70–180 mg/dL), in the
hypoglycemic range (,70 mg/dL), and in
the hyperglycemic range (.180 mg/dL).
QOL Measures
To assess non–diabetes-specific QOL, two
commonly used self-report measures
were used: the World Health Organiza-
tion (Five) Well-Being Index (WHO-5)
(11) and the EQ-5D-5L (12). The WHO-5
is a five-item scale that assesses overall
well-being; item responses are summed
and multiplied by 4, resulting in a 0–
100-point scale. The EQ-5D-5L includes
five items to assess health status (mobility,
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort,
and anxiety/depression) in three levels of
severity (no, moderate, or severe prob-
lems) and one item to assess overall self-
rated health on a visual analog scale from
0 (worst imaginable health state) to
100 (best imaginable health state).
Three diabetes-specific QOL self-report
measures were completed: the Diabetes
Distress Scale (DDS), the Hypoglycemia
Fear Survey (HFS-II), and the Hypoglyce-
mic Confidence Scale (HCS). The DDS is a
17-item scale that assesses worries and
concerns specifically related to diabetes
and its management and has been shown
to be a good marker of diabetes-related
QOL (13). The DDS yields a total mean-
item score with four moderately inter-
correlated subscale scores: distress
concerning emotional burden, regimen
management, problems regarding emo-
tional support from others, and concerns
about obtaining satisfactory medical
care. The worry subscale of the revised,
18-item HFS-II assesses the frequency of
common concerns regarding hypoglyce-
mia (14), with items summed for a total
scale score. The HCS is a nine-item ques-
tionnaire that yields a total mean-item
score and evaluates the degree to which
patients feel able, secure, and comfort-
able about their ability to stay safe from
hypoglycemic-related problems (15).
For the CGM group alone, satisfaction
with CGM was assessed at 24 weeks with

Polonsky and Associates
737
 the CGM Satisfaction Survey, a 44-item
scale that yields a total mean-item score
as well as two subscale scores that evalu-
ate perceived benefits and perceived
hassles (16). For each item, respondents
indicated their degree of agreement or
disagreement on a 1–5-point Likert scale,
with a higher mean score indicating
greater CGM satisfaction. Of note, items
on the hassles subscale were reverse
scored when combined with benefit items
to provide the total mean score.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses followed the intention-to-treat
principle. The primary analysis was a treat-
ment group comparison of the change in
quality of life outcomes from baseline to
24 weeks that used linear regression mod-
els adjusted for baseline levels of the out-
come and clinical site as a random effect.
Analyses were repeated to include poten-
tial confounding variables of age, sex, and
diabetes duration as covariates. Cohen’s
d effect size was calculated to determine
the magnitude of the treatment group dif-
ferences. Exploratory analyses assessed
for interaction between the treatment ef-
fect on the change in QOL from baseline to
24 weeks and patient demographic base-
line factors by including interaction terms
in regression models. Finally, within the
CGM group, associations between CGM
satisfaction with change in QOL and glyce-
mic control were assessed in linear regres-
sion modelsadjusted forclinicalsite.Given
the large number of analyses, we adjusted
for multiple comparisons by using the
Benjamini-Hochberg procedure using a
false discovery rate of 0.05 (17). The
resulting adjusted P values are reported.
Initially, analyses were conducted with-
out imputation for missing values (i.e.,
used the missing-at-random approach)
and then repeated by using multiple im-
putation to supply values for missing data.
Because missing data were minimal and
no meaningful differences existed be-
tween the results of the analyses with
or without data imputation, only the re-
sults of the initial analysis that used the
missing-at-random (nonimputed) data
are presented. All statistical analyses
were performed with use of SPSS version
19.0 software (IBM Corporation) except
for imputation of missing data, which
was conducted with NORM version 2 soft-
ware (Pennsylvania State University) that
imputes data through the expectation-
maximization algorithm.
RESULTS
Among the 155 participants who com-
pleted the trial and were included in the
primary analysis, mean 6 SD age was
48 6 13 years (range 26–73 years), 45%
were female, mean T1D duration was
12 6 14 years, and baseline HbA1c was
8.6 6 0.6% (range 7.5–9.9%) (Table 1).
Group Differences in QOL Outcomes
CGM participants reported significantly
greater increases in hypoglycemic confi-
dence than SMBG participants, resulting
in a mean 6 SE cumulative difference of
0.23 6 0.09 between groups (P = 0.03, d =
0.40)(Table2).Ofnote,examinationofthe
individual items revealed that the most
striking group differences were in staying
safe from serious hypoglycemic problems
while sleeping (mean between-group dif-
ference 0.38 6 0.13; P = 0.02) and while
driving (mean between-group difference
0.20 6 0.10; P = 0.05) as well as partici-
pants’ rating of their partner’s overall hypo-
glycemicconfidence(mean between-group
difference 0.29 6 0.13; P = 0.05).
Modest decreases in diabetes-related
distress in the CGM group and increases
in the control group resulted in a mean 6
SE cumulative difference for total distress
of 0.23 6 0.07 between groups (P = 0.02,
d = 0.44). Significant group differences
were found in two of the four areas of
diabetes-related distress: regimen dis-
tress (P = 0.04, d = 0.31) and interpersonal
distress (P = 0.009, d = 0.51). As shown in
Table 2, these between-group differences
for diabetes-related distress and hypogly-
cemic confidence all persisted in models
that further adjusted for participant de-
mographic factors.
In comparison, no significant group dif-
ferences were observed in hypoglycemic
worry or in the non–diabetes-specific
QOL measures (WHO-5 and EQ-5D-5L).
No consistent patterns of interactions be-
tween study arm and participant factors
on change in the QOL outcomes were
found (including participant age, sex, eth-
nicity, education level, time since diagno-
sis, baseline SMBG frequency, baseline
glycemic measures [percent time in

CGM Satisfaction and Associations
With QOL and Glycemic Outcomes
As previously reported (10), satisfaction
with CGM was high (mean 6 SD 4.2 6
0.4), with perceived benefits noted as
very common (4.2 6 0.5) and perceived
hassles as relatively rare (1.7 6 0.5). Ad-
justed for participant demographic fac-
tors, overall CGM satisfaction (total scale
score) was moderately related to de-
creases in total diabetes-related distress
(B = 20.31, P , 0.001) and hypoglycemic
worry (B = 24.22, P = 0.03) and increases
in hypoglycemic confidence (B = 0.49, P ,
0.001) and overall well-being (WHO-5: B =
7.61, P = 0.02) (Table 3). On closer exam-
ination of the two subscales, perceived
benefits and perceived hassles revealed
that fewer mean hassles were significantly
linked with the same five QOL measures
in the expected directions (and the asso-
ciation with health status was now sign-
ificant, P , 0.05), but fewer mean
perceived benefits were significantly asso-
ciated only with decreases in total diabe-
tes distress (B = 20.18, P = 0.02) and
increases in hypoglycemia confidence
(B = 0.30, P = 0.003). No significant asso-
ciations between CGM satisfaction and
changes in any of the glycemic control
measures were apparent.
CONCLUSIONS
We found that CGM contributes to statis-
tically significant greater improvement in
diabetes-specific QOL measures (specifi-
cally, reductions in diabetes distress and
increases in hypoglycemic confidence) in
adults with T1D taking MDI compared
with those who use SMBG only. Effect
sizes for these group differences in dia-
betes-specific QOL were in the low/
moderate to moderate range (d = 0.31–
0.51), pointing to the practical significance
of the findings. These results support the
first of our two speculations about how
CGM might positively influence QOL:
CGM can help adults with T1D to regain
or enhance their sense of personal control
over their glucose control and, perhaps
more broadly, their diabetes. Of note,
the impact of CGM on these QOL out-
comes was not moderated by any of the
measured demographic factors (e.g., age,
education), baseline glycemic indices, or

 poor baseline QOL. These findings suggest,
therefore, that the reported improve-
ments in diabetes distress and hypoglyce-
mic confidence were consistent across
participants and that benefits were not
limited to specific subgroups or to those
with low confidence or high distress at
baseline.
Diabetes distress refers to the worries,
concerns, and fears that are relatively
common among individuals who strug-
gle with a progressive and demanding
chronic disease such as diabetes; high lev-
els of diabetes distress have been linked
to problematic diabetes management
and poor glycemic control (13,18). In ad-
dition to reporting greater reductions in
total diabetes distress than the control
group, participants in the CGM group in
the current study reported significantly
greater drops on two of the four DDS sub-
scales: regimen distress and interpersonal
distress. CGM use not only decreased
burden and concerns about the disease
and its management but also contributed
to a reduction in interpersonal tensions
with family and friends around diabetes
management.
Although previous behavioral and
education-based interventions have been
shown to have a positive impact on dia-
betes distress (19), DIAMOND is the first
study in our knowledge to demonstrate
that introduction of appropriate diabetes
technology can positively influence this
critical QOL dimension. However, the re-
ported reduction in diabetes distress
stands in contrast with three previous
CGM studies that examined the impact
of diabetes distress through the use of
similar measures, all of which failed to
show a CGM benefit along this QOL di-
mension (1,4,5). Although the improve-
ment in distress was only modest in the
current study, we believe that the benefit
is real and speculate that the uniqueness
of this finding may be due to the high
degree of accuracy and reliability of the
CGM used in the current study (20) com-
pared with the CGM devices used in the
prior studies; furthermore, ours is the
only study that has focused exclusively
on adults who use MDI.
This CGM trial was also the first in our
knowledge to examine the dimension of
hypoglycemic confidence, pointing to a
potentially unique benefit of CGM. While
improving glycemic control and reducing
hypoglycemic risk, CGM may have also
enhanced and supported patients’ sense

Continuous Glucose Monitoring and QOL
Diabetes Care Volume 40, June 2017
 of self-efficacy about hypoglycemiadthat
they can realistically be and feel safer than
was previously the case. As was shown
in the recent validation article, gaining
confidence in one’s own ability to avoid
or address hypoglycemia is distinctly dif-
ferent from experiencing reductions in hy-
poglycemia fear (21). Indeed, we found
that CGM did not significantly reduce hy-
poglycemic worry (one of the two critical
aspects of hypoglycemia fear), which paral-
lels the negative findings from three of the
four published CGM trials that examined
hypoglycemic worry (1,3,5), the one excep-
tion being the study by van Beers et al. (4).
Within the CGM group, broad satisfac-
tion with the device was apparent. In-
deed, mean CGM satisfaction (4.2) was
substantially higher than that reported in
previous studies: 3.9 6 0.5 in the JDRF
CGM Study (5) and 3.8 6 0.6 in the van
Beers et al. (4) study. In the current study,
device satisfaction was associated with
most of the diabetes-specific and non–
diabetes-specific QOL outcomes but not
with any of the glycemic outcomes, which
suggests that the patient’s perception of
CGM satisfaction (which may contribute
to whether the device continues to be
used over time) may be more strongly
influenced by the tangible sense that
one is feeling better (i.e., QOL) than by
the more abstract observation that one
is doing better (i.e., that one’s glycemic
values have improved). If true, this associ-
ation may have important clinical ramifi-
cations for addressing long-term use of
CGM. To encourage ongoing use (espe-
cially for patients whose interest may be
flagging), it may be valuable to aid pa-
tients in seeing where the device is help-
ing to enhance their QOL, not just
improving their glycemic control.
This study has several limitations. First,
it included only adults with T1D who use
MDI; therefore, whether similar findings
might have been observed in other pa-
tient groups of interest, such as teens
and insulin pump users with T1D or indi-
viduals with type 2 diabetes, remains un-
known. Second, study participants were
racially homogeneous, with the majority
of participants being non-Hispanic white
with a high education level (with more
than one-half of the sample reporting col-
lege degrees). Third, the study was lim-
ited to a 24-week trial period, so we do
not know whether such benefits would
be maintained over longer periods.
Finally, although the noted effect sizes
were small/moderate to moderate, im-
provement within the CGM group itself
was modest, and the potential clinical sig-
nificance is unknown. Within these con-
straints, however, we conclude that CGM
compared with SMBG only contributes to
statistically significant improvements in
diabetes-specific QOL as well as enhances
glycemic control in this population of
adults with T1D who use MDI.
