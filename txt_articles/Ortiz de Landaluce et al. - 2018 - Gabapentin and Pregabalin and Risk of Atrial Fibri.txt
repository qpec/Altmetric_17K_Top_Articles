Abstract
Introduction Gabapentin and pregabalin are widely prescribed to elderly people, but data on their pharmacokinetics, safety, 
and efficacy in this population are scarce. Neurological adverse effects are common. Atrial fibrillation (AF) associated with 
their use has been described in several case reports and case series, but the incidence is unknown.
Objective The aim of this study was to assess the association between exposure to gabapentin or pregabalin and AF in the 
elderly.
Methods Patients ≥ 65 years of age starting treatment with either gabapentin or pregabalin between January 1 and March 
31, 2015, free of cardiovascular disease, and who did not receive the alternate study medications were studied. They were 
compared with patients who initiated treatment with an analgesic opiate or with alprazolam or diazepam. The two primary 
outcome variables were a first claim of an oral anticoagulant plus an antiarrhythmic drug (OAC + AA), or of an oral anti-
coagulant or an antiplatelet agent plus an antiarrhythmic drug (OAC/APA + AA), in the 3 months after treatment initiation.
Results Compared with opiate analgesics, both gabapentin and pregabalin were associated with an increased risk of initiat-
ing OAC/APA + AA. The incidence was 6 of 668 (9.0 per 1000 patients) with gabapentin, versus 12 of 3889 (3.1 per 1000) 
with opiates, relative risk (RR) 2.91 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10–7.73), and for pregabalin it was 6 of 698 (8.6 per 
1000) RR 2.79 (95% CI 1.05–7.40). The comparison with alprazolam/diazepam gave similar results. The risks did not vary 
by age, sex, or co-treatment with NSAIDs, and they increased with dose.
Conclusion In elderly patients free of cardiovascular disease, an association between new exposure to gabapentin or prega-
balin and initiating treatment for AF was found. These results should be confirmed in other studies.
Key Points 
Gabapentin and pregabalin are used for various indica-
tions, mainly low back pain and other painful conditions. 
In randomized clinical trials they have shown uncertain 
efficacy and common neurological adverse effects.
Atrial fibrillation attributed to gabapentin and pregabalin 
has been described in case reports and in case series.
Compared with alternative drugs for their most common 
indications, starting treatment with gabapentin or prega-
balin was associated with an increased rate of initiation 
of antithrombotic and antiarrhythmic drugs, suggesting a 
new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation.
Given the potential clinical and public health implica-
tions of this association, its causal nature should be 
investigated in studies with individual patients’ data.

1 Introduction
Gabapentin and pregabalin are widely and increasingly used 
for various approved and off-label indications [1, 2], mainly 
chronic low back pain with or without a neuropathic com-
ponent, neuropathic pain, and anxiety. Although they are 
frequently used in the elderly [3–5], there are no published 
studies on their pharmacokinetics in subjects over the age of 
65 years, and evidence of efficacy and safety is unclear [6] 
and limited to younger adults [7–9].
Atrial fibrillation (AF) attributed to gabapentin and to 
pregabalin has been described in anecdotal case reports and 
in case series assembled through spontaneous reporting 
[10–14]. Atrial fibrillation appeared within the first 3 months 
of treatment in 70% of cases, > 80% of patients were older 
than 65 years, and 6% of cases with gabapentin occurred 
in patients with diabetes mellitus. We examined this asso-
ciation in the Catalan Health Service (CHS) electronic pre-
scription claims database.
2  
Methods
A retrospective cohort study was performed, based on 
the CHS prescription claims database. The CHS provides 
public-funded universal healthcare coverage to the entire 
population of Catalonia (7.5 million inhabitants), including 
all prescription drugs. The electronic prescription database 
contains complete records of all prescriptions from all gen-
eral practices and outpatient specialty clinics claimed from 
pharmacies in Catalonia. It includes data on patients’ age, 
sex, the dispensed medicines, and the date of the dispens-
ing. It does not contain systematic data on indications and 
clinical diagnoses [15].
In clinical practice, the most common uses of gabapentin 
and pregabalin are low back pain and/or sciatica with a gen-
erally ill-defined neuropathic component [2], and anxiety. 
We therefore aimed to compare all patients ≥ 65 years old 
who initiated treatment with gabapentin or with pregabalin, 
with patients who initiated treatment with other drugs alter-
natively used in the same conditions; that is, opiate analge-
sics for pain, and alprazolam or diazepam for anxiety. Alpra-
zolam and diazepam were chosen because they are the most 
widely used benzodiazepines for anxiety in Spain [16].
Four cohorts were studied: patients initiating treatment 
with gabapentin (ATC code N03AX12), with pregaba-
lin (N03AX16), with an opiate analgesic (N02A), or with 
alprazolam or diazepam (N05BA12 or N05BA02), between 
January 1 and March 31, 2015 were considered. For each 
patient, the index date was the date of the first dispensing 
of the corresponding medication of interest. Previous use of 
cardiovascular medications was considered as a marker for 
cardiovascular disease or cardiovascular risk, and also as a 
potential confounding factor. Therefore, patients who had 
received a cardiovascular medicine (Group C of the ATC 
classification) or an antithrombotic agent (oral anticoagulant 
or antiplatelet agent; groups B01AA, B01AE, and B01AF 
of the ATC classification) in the 6 months before the index 
date were excluded.
Start of treatment with any of the study medications was 
defined as a claimed prescription for a patient who had not 
been dispensed that medication in the 6 months preceding 
the index date. The primary analyses were performed in 
patients who initiated treatment with only one of the study 
medications (and not with other study medications). Sec-
ondary analyses were performed including all patients who 
initiated treatment with each of the study drugs, including 
those on concomitant treatment with any of the other study 
medications (e.g., patients concomitantly on pregabalin and 
alprazolam, pregabalin and an opiate, etc.). Within each 
cohort, patients were stratified into three groups: those who 
started treatment with the medication of interest without a 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), those who 
started with both the medication of interest and an NSAID, 
and those to whom the medication of interest had been 
added to an NSAID that had already been dispensed in the 
6 months before. The main analyses were performed consid-
ering only patients who initiated treatment with any of the 
medications of interest and not with an NSAID.
The outcome measure was the proportion of patients 
claiming a first prescription of medications specifically 
used in the treatment of AF in the 3 months after the date 
of the initial dispensing of the study drug. Several outcome 
variables were selected. The primary co-variables were a 
first claim of an oral anticoagulant (OAC, groups B01AA, 
B01AE, and B01AF of the ATC classification) plus an 
antiarrhythmic drug (AA, ATC code, C01B) (OAC + AA), 
and a first claim of an OAC or an antiplatelet agent (APA, 
ATC code, B01AC) plus an antiarrhythmic drug (OAC/
APA + AA). Two secondary variables were examined: a 
first claim of an AA, and a first claim of an OAC or an APA 
(OAC/APA). The secondary variable OAC/APA, with higher 
numbers of patients, was used for the analyses stratified by 
dose, age, and sex.
The cohorts of users of gabapentin, pregabalin, or any of 
both were compared with the cohort of opiate users and with 
that of alprazolam or diazepam users.
For each outcome variable, relative risks and their cor-
responding two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were 
computed using the VassarStats website for statistical com-
putation (http://vassa 
rstat 
s.net). Stratified analyses were 
performed by age groups (65–74, 75–84, and ≥ 85 years), 
by sex, and by co-treatment with NSAIDs. In order to 
evaluate dose–effect relationships, two dose strata were 
considered: < 1200 and ≥ 1200 mg per day for gabapentin, 
 1327
Gabapentin and Pregabalin and Atrial Fibrillation
and < 150 and ≥ 150 mg per day for pregabalin. The out-
come variables with the highest numbers of patients (i.e., 
OAC/APA + AA and OAC/APA) were used for dose–effect 
analyses.
Ethical approval was not sought, because it is not required 
for observational studies using anonymized nationwide reg-
istries in Catalonia. This study is registered in the European 
Union Electronic Register of Post-Authorisation Studies (EU 
PAS Register) with the number EUPAS15048.

Results
From January 1 to March 31 2015, 5402 individuals 
aged ≥ 65 years initiated treatment with gabapentin, 6053 
with pregabalin, 37,500 with opiate analgesics, and 19,849 
with alprazolam or diazepam. Fig. S1 of the Electronic 
Supplementary Material (ESM) shows a flow chart on 
the selection of the study patients. The cohort of users of 
alprazolam or diazepam had higher proportions of females 
and of individuals in the younger age group (65–74 years 
of age) (Table 1).
Out of 5402 patients aged ≥ 65 years initiating treatment 
with gabapentin, 4490 (83.1%) were already on cardiovas-
cular medications. The corresponding figure for pregabalin 
was 4979 (82.3%).
In all four cohorts, the rates of treatment initiation with 
antithrombotic drugs (OAC/APA) or with OAC/APA plus 
an antiarrhythmic drug (OAC/APA + AA) in the 3 months 
after the dispensing of the medications of interest increased 
considerably with age, and it was higher with gabapentin and 
pregabalin compared with opiate analgesics or alprazolam/

diazepam (Fig. 1). There were no differences between males 
and females.
The incidence rates of initiating OAC/APA + AA were 
3.1 per 1000 exposed patients for alprazolam/diazepam, 
3.1 for opiate analgesics, 9.0 for gabapentin, and 8.6 for 
pregabalin (relative risk [RR] 2.91 [95% CI 1.10–7.73] for 
gabapentin, and RR 2.79 [95% CI 1.05–7.40] for pregabalin, 
compared with opiate analgesics). The incidence rates of 
initiating OAC + AA were 1.8 per 1000 patients for opiates, 
3.0 for alprazolam/diazepam, 6.0 for gabapentin, and 5.1 for 
pregabalin. Table 2 shows the risks of the primary and the 
secondary variables. All the risk estimates were increased, 
and their magnitudes were similar for gabapentin and prega-
balin. However, for the primary variable (OAC + AA) they 
did not reach statistical significance due to low numbers of 
patients, both in comparison with opiate analgesics and with 
alprazolam/diazepam. There were no differences in the risk 
estimates in the three age strata, nor by sex (Table S1 of the 
ESM). The results did not vary materially when all patients 
under the study medications were considered, including 
those who were concomitantly on more than one study drug 
(Table S2 of the ESM).
In each cohort, the results among patients who initiated 
treatment with the medication of interest added to an NSAID 
or at the same time as an NSAID were not different from 
those in patients who were not on NSAIDs (data not shown).
There were 561 patients treated with gabapen-
tin at doses < 1200 mg per day (84%), and 107 (16%) 
with ≥ 1200 mg per day. For pregabalin, 579 patients 
received < 150 mg per day (83%) and 119 (17%) 
received > 150 mg per day. The relative risks of the vari-
ables were twice as high among patients receiving the higher 
doses, compared with those on lower doses (Table 3).

Discussion
We found that, compared with users of opiates and of alpra-
zolam or diazepam, users of both gabapentin and pregabalin 
were at increased risk of initiating treatment with medicines 
specifically used in the management of AF within 3 months 
after treatment initiation. The RR estimates were consist-
ent for the primary and secondary variables and across 
the age, sex, and co-medication strata, and they showed a 
dose–response trend.
AF associated with gabapentin or pregabalin has not been 
described in reports of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) 
or in systematic reviews of RCTs. The reason may be that

Gabapentin and Pregabalin and Atrial Fibrillation
participants in placebo-controlled RCTs with gabapentin [8] 
or pregabalin [9] had a mean age of 55 years. In contrast, in 
a series of patients with AF possibly induced by gabapentin 
[13] or pregabalin [14], > 80% were older than 60 years.
Gabapentin and pregabalin exhibit L-type calcium chan-
nel antagonism and attenuate calcium influx, which can 
explain unwanted electrophysiological effects. Both drugs 
are eliminated by renal excretion as unchanged drugs, and 
both Summary of Product Characteristics (SPCs) state that 
elderly patients may require a dose reduction [17, 18]. How-
ever, pharmacokinetic studies in subjects over the age of 
65 years have not been reported [7].
Our study covered the whole population, so that rep-
resentativeness of the study population is not a concern. 
Patients on cardiovascular medications were excluded and 
the analyses were restricted to incident users, so that the 
potential biases and confounding that would have been intro-
duced by the inclusion of patients with high cardiovascular 
risk and prevalent users were avoided. Patients initiating 
treatment with gabapentin or with pregabalin were com-
pared with patients initiating treatment with two different 
alternative therapeutic options in the most common indica-
tions of gabapentinoids. The comparison with both opiates 
and benzodiazepines showed increases of risk in the same 
direction and of similar magnitudes. The results are biologi-
cally plausible, and they were consistent for the primary and 
the secondary variables and across all age, sex, and NSAID 
co-treatment strata. A dose–effect trend was found. A mate-
rial increase in risk with alprazolam or diazepam was not 
recorded. These features indicate that users of gabapentin 
and pregabalin are at increased risk of initiating antithrom-
botic and antiarrhythmic drugs, probably prompted by a 
diagnosis of AF.
Our study has several limitations. Those which merit 
more emphasis relate to the lack of clinical details on the 
participants and to the validity of the outcome variables 
used. The lack of clinical details precluded describing 
their clinical course and their prognosis and adjusting for 
potential clinical confounding factors such as the indica-
tion for use and co-morbidities. The outcome variables 
were surrogate markers of AF. A recent study performed 
in the French healthcare databases has suggested that the 
initiation of an oral anticoagulant and an antiarrhythmic 
drug (OAC + AA) recorded in the national pharmaceutical 
benefits database (SNIRAM) is the strongest predictor for 
confirmed AF [19]. In our study, the number of patients ini-
tiating OAC + AA was low. However, when patients exposed 
to either gabapentin or pregabalin were considered, the risk 
was significantly increased with respect to both opiate anal-
gesics and alprazolam/diazepam. Due to lower numbers of 
exposed patients, our stratified age, sex, and dose–response 
analyses were based on the variables OAC/APA and OAC/
APA + AA, which may be less specific for AF but included

higher numbers of patients. For these reasons, our results 
should be regarded as hypothesis generating.
It is generally considered that the use of prescription 
claims as proxy variables for the clinical conditions under 
study can limit the validity of the results. However, as an 
outcome variable, the prescription of an oral antithrombotic 
and/or an antiarrhythmic agent is at least as hard as an often 
tentative diagnosis of AF in the medical record. The use of 
antiarrhythmic drugs without antithrombotic medication, 
which may reflect prescribing for a patient with AF with a 
low risk of stroke, was also significantly increased in users 
of gabapentin or pregabalin.
If the association between exposure to gabapentinoids 
and AF is a causal one, its public health impact could be 
higher than suggested by our data, at least for three reasons. 
First, although the respective SPCs warn “caution in car-
diovascular patients” [17, 18], more than 80% of the new 
users of gabapentin or pregabalin were already on at least 
one cardiovascular medication, which is a marker of cardio-
vascular risk. In order to avoid confounding, we excluded 
these high-risk patients from the study. Second, in large 
series of cases reported to the FDA, 70–80% of patients 
with newly diagnosed AF attributed to gabapentin or prega-
balin had developed the condition during the first 3 months 
of treatment [13, 14], suggesting that additional cases can 
appear > 3 months after treatment initiation. Third, up to 
30% of cases of AF may take time to be diagnosed [20, 21] 
and many of those who are diagnosed do not receive full 
anticoagulation initially [22], so that the actual number of 
cases of AF is probably higher than the number of patients 
initiating treatment with an antithrombotic drug. Conversely, 
an episode of AF occurring before the prescription of gabap-
entin or pregabalin may have been initially overlooked or left 
untreated, but diagnosed and treated some weeks after the 
gabapentinoid was prescribed, and this would overestimate 
the risk.
In recent years, the consumption of gabapentin and pre-
gabalin has increased steadily [1, 3–5, 23]. Pain appears to 
be their most common indication [2, 24]. Although their 
efficacy in neuropathic pain is modest at best, they are 
widely used for conditions in which the neuropathic com-
ponent is difficult to establish. In industry-sponsored pla-
cebo-controlled RCTs in neuropathic pain, gabapentin was 
ineffective at doses < 1200 mg per day [8] and pregabalin 
at doses < 150 mg per day [9]. The best (lowest) number 
needed to treat for at least a 50% pain relief over baseline 
with pregabalin was 3.9, but only with a dose of 600 mg 
daily, which in turn was associated with a withdrawal rate 
of 19% (mainly due to dizziness and somnolence) [9]. In a 
recent rigorously conducted placebo-controlled trial, pre-
gabalin at doses of 150–600 mg daily was ineffective to 
mitigate pain or disability in patients with painful sciatica, 
and it was associated with a 3-fold increase in the incidence 
of dizziness [6]. A recent systematic review on gabapenti-
noids in chronic low back pain concluded that limited evi-
dence shows a significant risk of adverse effects without 
any demonstrated benefit [25]. In our study, 84% of patients 
on gabapentin or pregabalin had been prescribed < 1200 mg 
per day or 150 mg per day, respectively, and the risks of the 
main outcome variables were already increased with these 
lower doses.
Gabapentin was approved in 1993 as adjunctive therapy 
for partial complex seizures. Heavy promotion for unap-
proved indications pushed its sales in the US from US$98 
million in 1995 to nearly US$3 billion in 2004 [26]. In that 
year gabapentin lost its patent, but Pfizer launched pregaba-
lin, not only for epilepsy but also for the wider, softer, and 
better selling indications of anxiety and neuropathic pain. 
Gabapentin and pregabalin are being prescribed off-label for 
painful conditions, mainly low back pain [2], where the neu-
ropathic component is difficult to establish. In 2016 pregaba-
lin reached global sales of US$5435M, and it ranked 12th in 
the list of global top-selling pharmaceuticals [27]. Between 
2012 and 2016, prescriptions of gabapentin increased from 
39 to 64 million, and sales of pregabalin increased by more 
than 2.4-fold in the US [1]. Our results contrast with the fact 
that after decades of wide and rising clinical use of gabapen-
tin and pregabalin, only a few case reports and case series of 
AF attributed to these drugs have been described.

Conclusion
In summary, we found that, despite warnings of caution in 
the elderly in the respective SPCs, gabapentin and pregaba-
lin were predominantly prescribed to patients with cardio-
vascular risk, generally at doses too low to be effective. In 
addition, we found a signal suggesting that in elderly patients 
free of cardiovascular disease, exposure to gabapentin or to 
pregabalin may be associated with an increased risk of AF. 
The incidence might be substantially higher than is stated in 
the respective SPCs. This association should be confirmed 
by a review of the company’s postmarketing surveillance 
data and in studies with validated clinical diagnoses. Mean-
while, given the poor efficacy and benefit/risk ratio of these 
drugs in their most common indications in clinical practice, 
prescribers should avoid them, particularly in the elderly 
and in patients with established or suspected cardiovascular 
disease or with high cardiovascular risk. In clinical practice, 
it seems advisable to stop gabapentin or pregabalin in any 
exposed patient presenting with AF.
