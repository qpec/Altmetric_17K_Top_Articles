elementary schools: food and beverage
marketing to children in two Mexican cities

Abstract
Background: Unhealthy environments and food advertisements are major determinants of childhood obesity.
Recent regulation has banned unhealthy foods from schools in Mexico. However, currently there is no regulation
limiting exposure to food marketing around schools. Thus, our objective was to analyze the characteristics of food
advertising practices around 60 elementary schools in two cities and to evaluate compliance with the Pan
American Health Organization (PAHO) recommendations and the local food industry self-regulatory marketing
code.
Methods: Data were collected during the period of October 2012 to March 2013. A random sample of elementary
schools was selected from two Mexican cities. Using geographic information systems, we drew a 100-m-diameter
buffer around each school. Trained personnel obtained photographs to assess the locations and types of food
advertisements. Our results were stratified by school type and by indicators of compliance with the PAHO and
industry recommendations. We developed a multivariate negative binomial regression model to determine factors
predicting the number of advertisements around schools.
Results: The number of advertisements was significantly higher around public schools than around private schools
(6.5 ± 5.6 vs. 2.4 ± 3.5, p < 0.05). Printed posters were the most common type of marketing medium (97%), showing
mostly sugar-sweetened beverages, sweet breads, candies, and bottled water. Promotions, such as special prices or
gifts, were included on 30% of printed posters. Food advertising practices were often in compliance with industry
recommendations (83%) but not with those from the PAHO (32%) (p < 0.001).
Conclusion: Our results support the importance of monitoring the obesogenic environment and identifying policy
tools to protect children from food marketing not only inside schools but also around them, particularly in lower
income communities.

Background
Childhood obesity is a major public health problem
around the world, in particular in developing countries,
where it has shown an alarming increasing trend in the
last 30 years [1–4]. Recently, diverse studies have identi-
fied exposure to unhealthy environments as a major de-
terminant of obesity in populations experiencing what is
termed the nutrition transition [5–8]. These obesogenic
environments are typically characterized by low active
transportation and poor physical activity, infrastructure,
and facilities, together with increased access to low-cost,
ready-to-eat, energy-dense foods and sugar-sweetened
beverages promoted by ubiquitous marketing strategies
[4, 9–11]. One of the most important drivers of this epi-
demic is a shift in the food system, which is affecting
dietary intake. Together, these conditions promote in-
activity, sedentary lifestyles, and excessive caloric con-
sumption, resulting in high obesity prevalence [2].
In Mexico, results from the National Health and Nu-
trition Surveys from 1988 to 2012 show that overweight

 and obesity prevalence in school-aged children (5–
11 years) has increased over the last 20 years. Currently,
overweight and obesity affect 34% of all school-aged
children in the country [12, 13]. The Pan American
Health Organization (PAHO) has published recommen-
dations in relation to food and beverage marketing to
children stating that there should be no marketing tech-
nique on any communication channel to promote foods
high in fats, sugars, or salt to children, including no
marketing communications in places where children
gather and spend time such as schools and parks. The
list of marketing channels includes, among others, out-
door printed advertising, in-store marketing, celebrity
endorsements, incentives, and prize promotions. However,
the food industry allocates a substantial portion of their
marketing budget to influencing children’s consumption
preferences [14–16]. Using actors, athletes, artists, celebri-
ties, cartoons, attractive designs and messages, innovative
media, discounts, gifts, and promotions, advertisements
for many products of poor nutritional value are able to in-
fluence children’s choices [17–19].
At the time this study was undertaken, there was no
regulation of food and beverage marketing to children in
Mexico. In 2009, the Council of Ethical Self-Regulatory
Marketing, created by the food industry, established a
code of ethics to address marketing of food and bever-
ages directed to children known as PABI (from the
Spanish, Publicidad de Alimentos y Bebidas Dirigidas al
Público Infantil) [20] as a proactive measure to avoid
federal regulation. This code established 30 ethical
norms in addition to mechanisms to enable the code’s
control and application [21]. This self-regulatory code
has been criticized and is considered insufficient to pro-
tect children, as becomes apparent when it is compared
with international recommendations from health organi-
zations [14, 22]. Some of the most conspicuous differ-
ences
between
these
norms
and
international
recommendations
from
health
agencies
and
expert
groups are the following: a) differences in the age groups
used to define children < 12 years of age in the self-
regulatory code vs. < 16 years; b) self-regulatory code
based on industry consensus vs. state regulated; c) moni-
toring and evaluation by an industry-nominated com-
mittee vs. by an independent council; d) self-regulatory
code containing ambiguous nutritional profiles that
allow some products high in sugar, fat, or sodium to be
marketed to children vs. no marketing to children; and
e) a self-regulatory code allowing the promotion of
products directed to children using characters and other
strategies which are not recommended by international
health agencies [14, 23, 24].
The environment around schools may contribute in
different ways to the children’s nutritional status; i.e. ac-
tive transportation opportunities and the influence of
marketing are two major examples of how this environ-
ment affects physical activity or food choices. Further-
more,
active
transportation
promotion
intended
to
prevent obesity, might contribute to child’s weight gain
if intensive marketing exposure is present. However,
health researchers from developing countries have barely
described this phenomenon. In Latin America, studies
have been conducted to investigate TV advertising of
food and beverages (in Mexico, Colombia, Guatemala,
and Brazil, among others) and marketing inside schools
[23, 25–28]. Marketing inside schools, a common prac-
tice by the major soda and snack brands, was forbidden
under
the
healthy
school
guidelines
introduced
in
Mexico in 2010 [29–31]. Preliminary evaluations of this
policy are promising, but results differ according to so-
cioeconomic status (SES) [27]. Schools in the poorest
areas of the country have been less effective in imple-
menting the guidelines, suggesting that special attention
must be paid to vulnerable groups to promote healthier
and less obesogenic environments [27]. However, adver-
tising around schools is harder to characterize and regu-
late. Walton et al. evaluated the number of food stores
and advertisements that children encounter during the
trip from home to school and back in New Zealand,
finding that 87% of children were exposed to at least one
food advertisement on the house–school–house route
[32]. Other studies have suggested that this type of ad-
vertising could influence children’s food and beverage
choices [17, 33]. Yet, this environmental factor is not
considered by current obesity prevention efforts, and
school routes could be targeted to reduce unhealthy
choices made by children.
The objective of this study was to describe the pres-
ence of food and beverages advertising around schools
in two cities in Mexico and to evaluate compliance with
the PAHO recommendations on marketing of food and
non-alcoholic beverages to children and with the Mexi-
can food industry’s self-regulatory marketing code re-
garding marketing of foods and beverages to children.
Methods
Study design and sample selection
This study was carried out in the cities of Cuernavaca
and Guadalajara to characterize the obesogenic environ-
ment around elementary schools. Data were obtained
from October to December 2012 in Cuernavaca and
from January to March 2013 in Guadalajara. These pe-
riods assured that surveys were collected always during
school days. The universe of schools from each city was
obtained from the Ministry of Education school registry
in Cuernavaca (n = 200 of those 99 were private and 101
public schools) and Guadalajara (n = 714 of those 562
were private and 152 public schools). Stratified probabil-
istic sampling techniques were used. Random selection

 was done using Epidata, version 3.1. Strata were repre-
sented by the schools’ categories (i.e., public or private),
and all schools had the same probability of being se-
lected. Type of school (private or public) is considered a
proxy of SES, since private schools charge fees that most
families from low-income groups cannot afford. We ran-
domly selected approximately 30 schools per city from
the total universe using Epidata software [34]. A total of
29 schools in Cuernavaca (private = 16, public = 13) and
31 in Guadalajara (private = 11, public = 20) formed the
final sample group (n = 60). Maps were generated using
the
main
door
of
selected
schools
as
centers
of
computer-generated circular buffers with a 100-m diam-
eter. The size of the buffer was defined based on the
minimum recommended proximity criteria that should
be free from food and beverage advertising, according to
the PAHO recommendations and on budget constraints
[14]. From the 100-m diameter circular area, we assessed
the non-school section of the circle. We adjusted our re-
sults for the buffer size, depending on the size of the
school’s facilities.
These buffer zones were inspected for convenience
stores, markets, cafeterias, restaurants, and any other
kind of commercial source of food and beverage adver-
tising. The owners of the establishments provided in-
formed consent to conduct this
investigation. The
Institutional Review Board from the National Institute of
Public Health approved the study in April 2012. Add-
itional details on the methodology have been published
elsewhere [35].
Data collection
We conducted an inventory of advertisements showing
industrial food products, processed food and beverages
(except alcohol) inside and outside the convenience
stores. Advertisements were defined as any poster, ban-
ner, sticker, painting on walls, or flags inside or outside
stores, and billboards and walls not related to the stores,
in the buffer areas.
Trained and standardized field personnel collected
data and photographs of the food advertisements. We
used a format that allowed us to capture the characteris-
tics of the food product, i.e., brand name, type of adver-
tisement, and use of promotions. We followed quality
control procedures for coding of advertisements, data
georeferencing, and classification. Using this procedure,
we were able to quantify the total number of conveni-
ence stores surrounding schools and of advertisements
inside and outside stores. Direct audits were conducted
during school hours (Monday-Friday 9:00 am to 5:
00 pm). The data were classified into the following cat-
egories: soda, juices, and sugar-sweetened beverages;
sweet snacks (e.g., donuts and desserts); chocolates and
candies; milk and dairy products; salty/fried snacks;
water; ice cream, and other foods. Finally, we evaluated
their compliance with the PAHO recommendations for
marketing to children and the Mexican food industry’s
self-regulatory PABI code.
Compliance with the PAHO recommendations for
marketing to children
We evaluated whether advertisements around the school
buffer zones were in compliance with three selected
PAHO criteria (Table 1): use of characters, location; pro-
motions, incentives and discounts. We also evaluated
whether this marketing complied with three selected di-
mensions of the food industry’s PABI self-regulatory
code; price, characteristics and status (Table 1). Al-
though there are other criteria in both the recommenda-
tions and the code, those listed here are the ones
relevant to the environment around elementary schools.
Marginalization index
As a proxy for socioeconomic development, we used the
National Population Council 2010 marginalization index.
This index applies a score per basic sampling unit calcu-
lated using principal component analysis from data ob-
tained from the National Population and Household
Census 2010, considering four dimensions: access to
health care, access to education, characteristics of the
household, and availability of basic goods.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated, stratified by public
and private schools, and indicators of compliance with
PAHO
marketing
recommendations
and
the
self-
regulatory PABI code were compared. We used a chi-
square test to compare categorical variables in different
schools’ categories (i.e., public or private, used here as
proxy of SES); we used Poisson regression models to
compare the number of stores, and we also used a nega-
tive binomial regression model for the number of adver-
tisements observed in the surroundings of those schools.
Then we used a two-sample test of proportions to com-
pare the school’s category in terms of the characteristics
of those advertisements. A multivariate analysis of the
main factors predicting the number of advertisements
around schools was estimated. A multivariate logistic
regression model was calculated to analyze the prob-
ability of compliance of a food advertisement depend-
ing on environmental and community factors. To
determine factors predicting the number of advertise-
ments around schools, we developed a negative bino-
mial regression model to account for schools with no
convenience stores or food businesses around them,
and thus no advertisements. We selected counting
methods based on the differences between observed
and
estimated
probabilities

each
counting,

 different likelihood tests and information criteria con-
cerning alternative counting models [36]. All statis-
tical analyses were conducted using the statistical
software Stata, version 13.0 [37]. The ethics, biosecur-
ity, and research commissions at the National Insti-
tute
of
Public
Health
authorized
all
procedures
related to this research.
Results
We found 103 convenience stores and mini-markets
around 43 of the participating schools in the two cities
and these establishments were more frequently observed
surrounding public schools than private ones. In total,
we observed 278 food and beverage advertisements
around the schools. The number of advertisements in
convenience stores was significantly higher around pub-
lic schools than around private schools (6.5 ± 5.6 vs. 2.4
± 3.5, p < 0.05) (Table 2). A total of 30.2% of the food ad-
vertisements were located inside the stores, while most
were located outside (69.8%). Only three billboards mar-
keting alcoholic beverages were registered in the buffer
areas of both cities, thus this information was excluded
from the analysis.
Of the total number of advertisements collected (n =
278), 50.7% were for sugar-sweetened beverages—mainly
soda and juices—followed by sweet breads and snacks
(15.8%) and candy and chocolates (9.4%). A small num-
ber of bottled water advertisements were also observed
(3.2%). We observed similar percentages of food prod-
ucts around both public and private schools. Only in the
case of milk and dairy products did we find a higher
proportion of advertisements around public schools than
around
private
schools
(8.9%
vs.
3.1%,
p < 0.050)
(Table 3). Of the total number of advertisements, 29.9%
had some type of promotion: special price (18.4%), gifts
(7.9%), discounts (1.1%), or another type of promotion
(2.5%). The most common medium used was printed
posters (97.1%).
We found significant differences in the compliance of
the marketing of food and beverage products with the
PAHO recommendations and with the self-regulatory
PABI code. The percentage of advertisements complying
with the WHO/PAHO recommendations was smaller
than that complying with the PABI code (32% vs. 83%;
p < 0.01) (Table 2). The lowest compliance was observed
in the PAHO recommendation concerning the use of
famous
characters
in
food
advertisements
(71.2%),
followed by promotion messages (70.8%) (Data not
shown in tables). The logistic regression model showed
that the probability of complying with the PAHO criteria
was higher for advertisements complying with the PABI
code (OR = 1.13, p = 0.07) and lower in Guadalajara than
in Cuernavaca (OR = 0.81, p = < 0.01). The probability of
complying with the PAHO criteria was also lower
when the product advertised was milk and dairy
products (OR = 0.64, p = 0.010) (Table 4).
When
we
assessed
potential
factors
associated
with the frequency of food and beverage advertise-
ments
around
schools
using
negative
binomial
regression, we found that public schools had signifi-
cantly (p < 0.001) more advertisements in stores than
private schools (Table 5).

Location
In recommendation 7, the PAHO expert
consultation group established that
“marketing” should be defined as all
marketing techniques through all
communication channels, including messages
disseminated in schools and other places
where children gather and spend time. These
places include schools, parks, sport centers,
nurseries, doctors’ offices, and any other
places where children congregate.
In terms of this study, we defined any
advertisement within 100 m of a school as
marketing in places where children gather
and spend time.
Promotions, incentives,

The PAHO recommends restricting
advertisements for foods high in saturated fat,
trans fatty acids, sugar free, or salt (including
special offers and incentives such as
sweepstakes, coupons, or other discounts).

Selected criteria
Definition
Price
The price of the food must be declared in a
concrete and understandable manner. Use of
specific words such as “only” and “less than”
should be avoided when referring to price.
Characteristics
According to PABI, publicity has to be
accurate when showing food or beverage
product characteristics, without assigning
nutritional values or superior characteristics to
those that the product has.
It is important to mention that the code does
not include specific criteria to evaluate food
product characteristics. Therefore, we
considered advertisements as non-compliant
with the code when the images shown did
not correspond with product characteristics
such as flavor, size, content, and nutritional
properties. The most common case of non-
compliance we found was that of nutritional
values in advertisements showing images of
food (fruits) that a product (soda) does not
contain.
Status
It is forbidden to mislead or confuse a child
with the idea of a characteristic of superiority
that would be acquired by consuming the
product, such as increased strength,
popularity, or attractiveness.

 Discussion
The contribution of the environment to the rise in obesity
has been extensively described in recent years in diverse
parts of the world [2, 7, 38]. To understand and tackle this
complex problem, a multidisciplinary and multisectoral
approach
is
necessary,
including
monitoring
and
regulation of food industry marketing actions oriented to-
ward influencing children’s preferences [17, 39–42]. Previ-
ous studies have documented a substantial presence of
marketing to children around schools, and this has been
recognized as a contributing factor in child obesity
[32, 43]. Our study showed that most elementary schools
(n = 43) were surrounded by convenience stores that work
as food and beverage marketing units. Currently, although
there are guidelines being used, there is no enforcement
of regulations of these practices. Most marketing materials
are designed for placement outside of stores (69.8%), in-
creasing the potential influence and overall impact on the
local community. The present study also showed that chil-
dren from public schools are more likely to be exposed to
this kind of marketing than children from private schools,
which are typically more affluent and located in wealthier
and more protected neighborhoods. A number of studies
have found an important relation between food environ-
ments, quality of food, food stores and products based on
socio-economic characteristics [3]. In our study, children
from low-income families were more exposed to a higher
presence of marketing and have more access to unhealthy
foods than the better-off children from these cities
(Cuernavaca and Guadalajara) did. As expected, sugar-
sweetened beverages and sweet snacks comprised a major
component of these advertisements (66.5%), and as ob-
served in studies from other countries [25, 26, 28, 43–45].
In Mexico, this is a public health concern of major rele-
vance, since Mexico is the highest per capita soda con-
sumer in the world, showing a high prevalence of
childhood obesity and diabetes as the leading cause of
mortality [12, 46, 47]. A number of policies aimed at redu-
cing consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages by chil-
dren in particular and by the population in general have
been developed recently, such as the healthy hydration
recommendations, the national agreement for healthy nu-
trition, the guidelines for healthy nutrition inside schools,
and the soda tax [12, 48, 49]. However, our study docu-
ments the need for additional actions to effectively reduce
sugar-sweetened beverage and unhealthy food consump-
tion by children.
Only 18.1% of the advertisements complied with the
PAHO recommendations for food and beverage market-
ing to children, as opposed to 83.5% that were in com-
pliance with the food industry’s self-regulatory code,
similar to the findings of studies in other countries [21,
26, 43, 50–56]. In addition, the industry self-regulatory
code is vague in terms of the parameterization of the
evaluated areas, which makes evaluation difficult and
subject to interpretation by the evaluation group. This
reflects the need to identify mechanisms to enforce
regulation based on national and international recom-
mendations from health organizations, which protect
children with a health-in-all policies approach and avoid

 leaving this responsibility to individuals or actors in-
volved in the public health sector alone [57–59]. Of
great concern is that 16.5% of the products did not even
comply with the food industry’s self-regulatory code, re-
gardless of its laxness in protecting children. The fact
that the number of advertisements is associated with the
density of convenience stores reflects the important role
that these small community food stores play as an open
channel contributing to and influencing the exposure of
children to food and beverage marketing.
A number of scholars have described the environmen-
tal and socioeconomic factors associated with food in-
take and choices [11, 60]. The nutrition transition
observed in Mexico over the last years has modified
negatively food choices with some differences by SES.
For example, of low income populations consume a
greater proportion of less-healthy beverages [61]. Active
commuting to school in Mexico is negatively associated
with obesity and is currently seen as an activity that may
result in health benefits and therefore needs to be sup-
ported [62]. On the other hand, marketing of unhealthy
foods around schools might reduce some of these bene-
fits, since children are more susceptible to be influenced
by marketing [11].
Our study represents a first approximation of the
characterization of this phenomenon, but these results
must be considered with caution. Although the study is
representative of two urban cities in Mexico, its external
validity is not assured, and further investigation is
needed to understand the magnitude and characteristics
of this phenomenon nationwide, particularly in a more
heterogeneous range of socioeconomic conditions given
the current results pointing to higher marketing inten-
sity in vulnerable, less affluent groups. Our buffer size
was small compared to those used in other similar stud-
ies, which might account for the lower density of food
marketing described here. We selected this buffer size
because the required data was not available from any
GIS system or database. Thus, we implemented labor-
intensive direct observation of field personnel work [25,
32, 43, 53]. We think this conservative approach was
sufficient to document the problem with the available
resources. Information was obtained from a single visit,
so our results did not evaluate seasonality. Thus, some
promotions such as those around Children’s Day, sports
tournaments, and other events were not necessarily cap-
tured. In addition, we did not consider size and other in-
depth content of the advertisements or other types of
businesses that could potentially sell or market un-
healthy foods or beverages. We collected information on
non-alcoholic beverages and food; however, the market-
ing of alcoholic beverages and cigarettes is also a prob-
lem
that
needs
to
be
considered
and
limited
by
regulations to protect child health [52]. Finally, this
study does not address the impact of advertisements on
children’s
perceptions
or
knowledge
about
nutrition
choices or the effects on diet; evidence of this association
has been extensively discussed elsewhere [11, 63, 64].
A substantial number of policies that contribute to con-
trolling the obesity epidemic have recently been enacted
in Mexico. These include a soda and sugar-sweetened bev-
erage tax, a new food-labeling system, and new guidelines
for healthy nutrition in schools [12]. One important
challenge is to monitor and evaluate the impact of these
policies. Another major challenge is to identify comple-
mentary actions that are needed to make these policies ef-
fective. In this case, the new school regulations and
guidelines might be at risk of having only a modest effect
if conditions around schools remain unfavorable or, even
worse, if marketing around schools increases and becomes
endemic in response to tighter regulations inside schools
and through other media channels. The fact that most
marketing around schools originates in food businesses
and is mostly located outside the stores might imply that
relatively simple local regulations could contribute to im-
proving the environment without the need for federal le-
gislation. However, without proper regulation, companies
that market to children will be able to redirect their efforts
to alternative strategies such as discounts or to different
media channels (i.e., from schools and TV to billboards,
sports, and/or the Internet) [65–70]. Thus, comprehensive
legislation to protect children from food advertisements
around schools and in other contexts is crucial. This is an
area where action is urgent and necessary, given not only
the impact on children but also the documented targeting
of vulnerable populations with the potential of generating
important health disparities [21, 71, 72]. Exploring the
characteristics of an obesogenic environment could be an
effective approach to identifying other similarly important
areas of opportunity to complement obesity prevention
actions—specifically, how to increase physical activity, im-
prove access to nutrition information, and disincentivize
misleading marketing practices [59, 72].
Conclusions
Our results support the importance of monitoring the
obesogenic environment and identifying ways to protect
children from food marketing not only inside elementary
schools but also around them, particularly children from
public schools and low-income neighborhoods who may
be more exposed to food marketing than children from
private schools and better-off neighborhoods. As in
other public health policies, planning should consider
potential unintended effects and design mechanisms to
prevent them. In this particular case, a coordinated local
action aligned to the federal policies is necessary to
avoid marketing strategies aimed at maintaining con-
sumption of unhealthy foods by children at schools.
