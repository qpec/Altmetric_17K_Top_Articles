Transparency about the outcomes of mental health services 
(IAPT approach): an analysis of public data
David M Clark, Lauren Canvin, John Green, Richard Layard, Stephen Pilling, Magdalena Janecka
Summary
Background Internationally, the clinical outcomes of routine mental health services are rarely recorded or reported; 
however, an exception is the English Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) service, which delivers 
psychological therapies recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence for depression and 
anxiety disorders to more than 537 000 patients in the UK each year. A session-by-session outcome monitoring system 
ensures that IAPT obtains symptom scores before and after treatment for 98% of patients. Service outcomes can then 
be reported, along with contextual information, on public websites.
Methods We used publicly available data to identify predictors of variability in clinical performance. Using β regression 
models, we analysed the outcome data released by National Health Service Digital and Public Health England for the 
2014–15 financial year (April 1, 2014, to March 31, 2015) and developed a predictive model of reliable improvement 
and reliable recovery. We then tested whether these predictors were also associated with changes in service outcome 
between 2014–15 and 2015–16.
Findings Five service organisation features predicted clinical outcomes in 2014–15. Percentage of cases with a problem 
descriptor, number of treatment sessions, and percentage of referrals treated were positively associated with outcome. 
The time waited to start treatment and percentage of appointments missed were negatively associated with outcome. 
Additive odd ratios suggest that moving from the lowest to highest level on an organisational factor could improve 
service outcomes by 11–42%, dependent on the factor. Consistent with a causal model, most organisational factors 
also predicted between-year changes in outcome, together accounting for 33% of variance in reliable improvement 
and 22% for reliable recovery. Social deprivation was negatively associated with some outcomes, but the effect was 
partly mitigated by the organisational factors.
Interpretation Traditionally, efforts to improve mental health outcomes have largely focused on the development of 
new and more effective treatments. Our analyses show that the way psychological therapy services are implemented 
could be similarly important. Mental health services elsewhere in the UK and in other countries might benefit from 
adopting IAPT’s approach to recording and publicly reporting clinical outcomes.

Introduction
In most countries, if you have a mental health problem 
patients cannot obtain information about the clinical 
outcomes achieved by the psychological therapy service 
that they might be considering for treatment. Additionally, 
when a service does hold such data, they will not usually 
be made public. This absence of transparency is a 
disservice to patients. It is also an impediment to the 
development of more effective health care, because it 
makes it difficult to study, and learn from, the variation in 
service outcomes.
The Improving Access to Psychological Therapies 
(IAPT) programme1 is a rare exception to the general 
absence of transparency about outcomes for mental health 
services. Starting in 2008, the UK Government developed 
a plan to expand access to evidence-based psychological 
therapies for depression and anxiety disorders by training 
a new workforce and deploying it in specialised services 
throughout England. Every local health area (otherwise 
known as a clinical commissioning group; CCG) now has 
an IAPT service, which provides psychological treatments 
in line with the stepped-care clinical guidelines2,3 issued by 
the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 
(NICE). For all anxiety disorders, cognitive behavioural 
therapy (CBT) is recommended. For depression, a wider 
range of treatments (CBT, counselling, couples therapy, 
interpersonal therapy, and brief psychodynamic therapy) 
are recommended. The latest data2 show that around 
950 000 people a year have an initial assessment and 
advice from the IAPT service, with more than 537 000 going 
on to have a course of therapy (defined as two or more 
sessions), with the predominant method being CBT.4,5 
A distinctive feature of IAPT is the use of an outcome 
monitoring system6 that ensures 98% of patients have 
scores recorded on well-validated self-report measures of 
depression and anxiety at the beginning and end of 
treatment, with CCG level summaries of such data 
publicly available. This system is a great improvement on

the national situation before the start of IAPT. At that 
time, a survey7 found that only 38% of patients had an 
assessment of their symptoms at the beginning and end 
of treatment.
To monitor IAPT outcomes, patients complete brief 
measures of depression and anxiety every session so that a 
symptom score for after treatment is available even if 
patients complete therapy earlier than expected. Therapists 
make use of the measures in treatment planning and 
supervision. IAPT services have specialised information 
technology systems that record patient data and make it 
available to therapists, supervisors, and managers. This 
session-by-session approach to outcome monitoring was 
successfully piloted in a community therapy service for 
victims of the Omagh bomb8 (County Tyrone, Northern 
Ireland) and was enhanced for use in IAPT.9
IAPT gathers detailed information about patients, their 
course of treatment, and clinical outcomes.9 Once a 
month these data are sent to National Health Service 
(NHS) Digital, which issues regular reports for the 
number of people accessing services and their outcomes, 
along with a range of process variables (eg, average 
number of sessions). The most complete dataset 
appears in the annual reports. Most data provided by 
NHS Digital are also available in Public Health England’s 
Common Mental Health Disorders Profiling Tool, along 
with other contextual information about CCGs (eg, 
social deprivation score).
In this Article, we aimed to illustrate the value of 
information from IAPT’s outcome monitoring system by 
using public data from the websites to identify 
organisational and other characteristics of services with 
better and worse outcomes.
Methods
IAPT outcome monitoring system
IAPT reports clinical outcomes for all patients who have 
had at least two sessions of treatment and have been 
discharged. Around 81% of people who are believed suitable 
for treatment have two or more sessions4 (appendix). We 
used publicly available data to identify the characteristics 
of IAPT services that achieve better and worse clinical 
outcomes. We analysed the outcome data released by NHS 
Digital and Public Health England for the 2014–15 financial 
year (April 1, 2014, to March 31, 2015) and developed a 
predictive model. We then waited until the IAPT data for 
2015–16 (April 1, 2015, to March 31, 2016) were released and 
tested whether the identified predictors replicated in the 
new dataset. We also tested whether change in predictors 
identified in the 2014–15 model was associated with change 
in outcomes between 2014–15 and 2015–16. Similarity of 
findings in analyses of between-service variation at a 
particular time and within service change over time would 
strengthen the argument that the identified predictors have 
a causal role because spurious third variables are unlikely 
to be similar in the two types of analysis.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Many randomised controlled trials have shown that 
psychological therapies are effective interventions for a wide 
range of mental health conditions. On the basis of these trials, 
the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) now 
recommends certain psychological therapies as first-line 
interventions for common mental health conditions such as 
depression and the anxiety disorders.
However, a large gap exists between recommendation and 
implementation. In particular, in most countries routine 
psychological therapy services do not record and publish their 
clinical outcomes, which makes it difficult to know if outcomes 
are in line with expectation and hinders attempts to study, and 
learn from, between-service variation in clinical outcomes.
The English Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) 
programme is an exception. IAPT services treat more than 
537 000 patients with depression or anxiety disorders each year 
using NICE-recommended psychological therapies. A unique 
outcome monitoring system allows IAPT to gather outcome 
data for 98% of treated patients. Since May 2012, the clinical 
performance of each service has been reported on public 
websites. We searched MEDLINE with search terms “IAPT” and 
“outcome” for articles published from May, 2012, to November, 
2017. Only one article, which focused on social deprivation, had 
used the national public data to predict outcomes. None had 
investigated service organisation.
Added value of this study 
We describe the IAPT outcome monitoring system, discuss why 
it is so effective, and illustrate the value of the publicly available 
data by construction of statistical models to predict local 
variation in outcomes in 2014–15. We also tested the 
robustness of the models by using them to predict changes in 
outcomes from one year to the next. We identified five aspects 
of the organisation of a service that are associated with 
improved clinical outcomes.
Implications of all the available evidence
Traditionally, clinicians have been sceptical about the 
possibility of obtaining outcome data for most people who 
are treated in routine psychotherapy services. We show that 
getting such data is possible and describe a system that could 
be applied in other countries. To date, efforts to improve the 
outcomes achieved with psychotherapies have mainly focused 
on the development of new and more effective treatments. 
Our analyses suggest that the way in which psychological 
therapy services are implemented could be similarly 
important. The findings open up new possibilities for the 
improvement of mental health care.

Measures of clinical outcome
The Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item (PHQ-9) score10 
(clinical cutoff >9) is used to measure symptoms of 
depression. The Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item 
(GAD-7) score11 (cutoff >7) is the default measure of 
anxiety but services can also use more specific measures 
for particular anxiety disorders.9 We modelled two of the 
standard outcome indices included in NHS Digital’s 
reports: the proportion of patients in a CCG who have 
reliably improved and the proportion who have reliably 
recovered. Patients are reliably improved if their scores 
on depression or anxiety, or both, have reduced by a 
reliable amount9,12 (ie, more than the measurement error 
of the scale) and neither measure has shown a reliable 
increase. Patients are reliably recovered if they reliably 
improve and their scores on both depression and anxiety 
are below the clinical cutoff scores9 at the end of 
treatment. We assumed that patients (2%) without scores 
after treatment had not improved or recovered. The total 
treated cohort is the denominator for calculation of 
reliable improvement. Only cases above the clinical 
cutoffs9 for depression, anxiety, or both before treatment 
are included in the computation of reliable recovery. The 
scores used to calculate reliable improvement and 
recovery are the last available after baseline scores, 
usually from the final therapy session but occasionally 
from an earlier session. NHS Digital does not report how 
often earlier session scores are used but data from an 
NHS Trust that provides multiple IAPT services suggest 
that the use of such scores is rare (2·5%; Green J, CNWL 
NHS Trust, personal communication).
Possible predictors of outcome
Six possible predictors were investigated. The first 
predictor was the percentage of treated patients for whom 
a problem descriptor (ICD-10 code)13 was recorded. This 
variable was regarded as important because the type of 
treatment a patient should receive is based on ICD-10 
codes.13 The second was the percentage of referrals who 
were treated, because this variable captures the extent 
to which services focus on treatment, as opposed to 
providing only assessment, advice, and signposting. The 
third was the percentage of missed appointments (patient 
did not attend and failed to give advance warning). The 
fourth was the number of days patients waited between 
referral and starting treatment, the fifth was the number 
of treatment sessions, and the sixth was the Index of 
Multiple Deprivation (IMD),14 for the area. The IMD 
covers seven domains, including income, employment, 
barriers to services, and crime. We did not use a seventh 
possible predictor (number of NICE-recommended 
depression treatments that the service could deliver) in 
the main analyses because preliminary analysis showed 
the NICE predictor did not relate to outcome. For the 
third and fifth predictors, in 2014–15, data were available 
only for the last 3 months of the study. For other 
predictors, data covering the full periods were used. The 
IMD values are from September, 2015, and represent the 
latest available figures.
Statistical analysis
Analyses of predictors of IAPT performance per CCG 
during single years were done in R software (version 3.2.2) 
with β regression15 (betareg package),16 as recommended 
for models with continuous but bounded outcomes (eg, 
proportions, with all data points falling between 0 and 1).16 
The method exploits the flexibility of β distribution, 
which accommodates data heteroscedasticity (unequal 
variance) and absence of symmetry around the mean, 
both common features of proportions data that are less 
well dealt with in commonly used logistic and linear 
regression models. A logit link function in β regression 
renders the coefficients interpretable in terms of odds 
ratios (ORs). Analyses were initially run on the 2014–15 
data and then repeated on the 2015–16 data.
To explore the associations between predictor and 
outcome variables, we first fitted simple regressions. 
Then we fitted a multiple regression model to each of the

outcomes, entering all predictors that were independently 
significantly associated with the outcome, which allowed 
us to assess the joint contribution of the predictors and 
account for possible correlations between them. We 
examined goodness of fit for multiple regression models 
using half normal plots of deviance residuals (plots of 
absolute values of standardised residuals). To detect any 
outliers that could bias our results, we identified CCGs 
with an especially large effect over model fit using Cook’s 
distance statistics. We inspected the characteristics of 
these CCGs, and residual plots before and after the 
exclusions, to decide whether to retain these CCGs in the 
final models (appendix). Up to two CCGs (<1% of the 
total sample) were excluded from a model when justified 
by these indices. We then plotted the results, and curves 
were fitted with the LOESS (locally weighted smoothing) 
function. Finally, for each predictor, we estimated the 
increase in the odds of improvement or recovery if the 
worst-performing CCG matched the best-performing 
CCG on that predictor.
We used ranges of predictor values recorded across the 
CCGs, and the ORs derived from the β regressions. 
Because ORs are additive on the log scale, the formula 
for these calculations was exp (log[OR] × range). For 
example, if the difference between worst-performing and 
best-performing CCG on a predictor was 100 units, and 
a unit of that predictor was associated with the 
odds of recovery of 1·001, the formula would be exp 
(log[1·001] × 100), producing an additive OR of 1·105. 
This OR value suggests that patients in the worst-
performing CCG would be 10·5% more likely to recover 
if this CCG were to match the highest values of this 
predictor recorded in the sample. To facilitate 
interpretation for all predictors that were negatively 
associated with outcome, we present the reciprocal of 
the original ORs (ie, original OR of 0·75 is presented 
as OR 1·33), which is in line with published 
recommendations17 to report ORs standardised to less 
than 1. For those variables, the possible gains in outcome 
indicated by the additive ORs would result from a 
decrease in the predictor value.
We also investigated whether changes in predictors 
between 2014–15 and 2015–16 were related to changes in 
clinical outcomes between the 2 years. For each CCG, we 
computed Δ scores, which relate to differences between a 
variable’s value in 2014–15 and in 2015–16. We first 
compared the mean Δ scores of our predictors in the 
10% of CCGs that improved most, the 10% that improved 
least or deteriorated, and the overall mean. To formally 
test these findings, we ran linear regressions using the 
Δ scores of predictors and outcomes, because outcomes 
were no longer proportion scores and were normally 
distributed. To identify the strongest predictors and 
obtain standardised indices of the variance explained 
by correlated predictors, we computed semi-partial 
correlations in full models (package ppcor), which 
indicate correlations between the outcome and any given 
predictor, while controlling for the effects of all other 
predictors. Although IMD did not change, we included 
absolute IMD score in all models to account for the 
possibility that social deprivation might affect the degree 
of change in clinical performance.

Validation procedures
To mitigate against any bias due to excessive statistical 
power or other data artifacts, we repeated all analyses in 
permuted datasets—ie, when the associations between 
outcomes and predictors were disrupted by random 
sampling. To further investigate whether associations 
identified with our preferred method of β regression were 
robust, we repeated the analyses using standard logistic 
regression. Both validation analyses suggest our results 
arise from true associations between outcomes and 
predictors, rather than any analytical artifacts (appendix).
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data

the decision to submit for publication.
Results
In 2014–15, 211 CCG-based IAPT services (table 1) treated 
468 881 patients.5 In 2015–16, mergers of some 
neighbouring CCGs resulted in 209 CCG-based IAPT 
services (table 1), which together treated 537 131 patients.4
In 2014–15, all potential predictors were significantly 
associated with reliable improvement and recovery when 
considered on their own (table 2), and for reliable 
recovery, all predictors were significant in multiple 
regression (table 2). Percentage of cases with a problem 
descriptor, the mean number of treatment sessions, and 
the percentage of referred patients who received a course 
of treatment were all positively associated with reliable 
recovery rates (table 2). Mean waiting time to enter 
treatment, the percentage of appointments that were 
missed, and the social deprivation of a CCG were 
negatively associated with reliable recovery rates (table 2). 
Mean waiting time to enter treatment, percentage of 
appointments missed, and percentage of referred 
patients who received a course of treatment were also 
significant predictors of reliable improvement in the 
multiple regression model (figure; other plots are shown 
in the appendix).
Table 2 shows additive ORs that estimate the changes 
in reliable improvement and recovery that might be 
achievable if the CCG with the lowest score for a 
particular predictor were to match the highest-scoring 
CCG. The analysis reveals considerable potential for 
improvement in the outcomes of some IAPT services. 
For example, if the IAPT service with the lowest 
percentage of patients being offered a course of treatment 
were to increase the proportion of people having 
treatment to the level of the most treatment-oriented 
service, recovery rates would increase by 33% and reliable 
improvement rates would increase by 90% (table 2). 
All six predictors were individually associated with 
change in reliable improvement and recovery between 
2014–15 and 2015–16 (appendix). In a multiple regression 
model, CCGs with the largest decreases in missed 
appointments and waiting times, and with the largest 
increases in problem descriptor completeness and 
percentage of referred patients who had a course of 
therapy, were also the CCGs that showed the largest 
increases in reliable improvement rates (table 3). Similar 
associations were noted for changes in reliable recovery, 
although fewer predictors were significant (table 3). 
Although social deprivation scores did not change 
between 2014–15 and 2015–16, CCGs with low amounts of 
social deprivation showed larger improvements in 
reliable recovery rates between 2014–15 and 2015–16 than 
CCGs with high amounts of social deprivation (table 3). 
Overall, the predictors we investigated explained a 
variance of 33% for change in reliable improvement 
and 22% for recovery rates.
As in 2014–15, all six predictors in 2015–16 were 
significantly associated with both reliable improvement 
and reliable recovery in single regression models. 
β regressions with multiple predictors showed that most 
predictors of CCGs IAPT outcomes in 2014–15 continued 
to be significant predictors in 2015–16 (table 4).
The 2015–16 dataset includes some potential predictors 
that were not available in 2014–15. Stepped care is a key 
organising feature of IAPT. Simple regressions showed 
that CCGs in which a larger proportion of patients 
had low-intensity treatment only had low reliable 
improvement and recovery rates, whereas those CCGs 
with high proportions of patients who had both low-
intensity and high-intensity interventions (stepped care) 
in their course of treatment had the highest reliable 
improvement and recovery rates (appendix). The 
proportion of patients with low-intensity and high-
intensity treatment was also a significant additional

Each blue dot represents predicted percentage of patients who reliably improve in a particular CCG, based on the 
predictor values recorded in that CCG and the effect sizes derived from the β regression. Therefore, although each

six of them, accounting for the non-linear trends. Red lines were smoothed with the LOESS method, and the dark

predictor in the multiple regression model (appendix). 
To investigate whether differences between CCGs in the 
initial severity of patients’ symptoms might have affected 
our findings, we ran additional multiple regressions that 
included mean pretreatment depression (PHQ-9) and 
anxiety (GAD-7) scores as additional predictors. The 
predictors that were significant in table 4 were significant 
for the additional multiple regressions analysis, and 
pretreatment symptom severity did not emerge as an 
additional predictor (appendix).
Discussion
In this Article, our analyses suggest that looking at the 
way in which therapy services are implemented might 
also be important for the improvement of clinical 
outcomes. Traditionally, researchers interested in the 
improvement of mental health outcomes have largely 
focused on trying to develop new and more effective 
therapies, and this work has led to major advances18,19 in 
psychological therapies. However, the 209 IAPT services 
included in the national dataset all aim to implement

NICE-recommended

for 
depression and anxiety disorders using a stepped-care 
model with therapists who have been through a national 
training programme.1 Although the overall outcomes are 
broadly in line with expectation from clinical trials,19 the 
performance of individual services varies greatly.
Key aspects of the way a service is organised predict a 
substantial amount of this variability, both within year and 
when modelling changes between years. The organisational 
factors identified make clinical sense. Services that are 
better able to identify the problems they are treating 
(problem descriptor completeness) are presumably more 
likely to give the right NICE-recommended treatment. 
Short waits between referral and treatment might ensure 
patients remain enthusiastic about engaging with 
treatment. A high average dose of treatment (number of 
sessions) is likely to improve outcomes, as is consistency 
of attendance (low percentage of missed appointments), 
and a service that is predominantly focused on treatment, 
rather than only assessment (high percentage of patients 
entering treatment). Focusing on treatment is reminiscent 
of the positive association in surgery between postoperative 
outcome and the volume of operations undertaken by 
hospitals and individual surgeons.20
The range of IAPT data that is placed in the public 
domain on NHS Digital and Public Health England’s 
websites is constantly expanding. Over time it will enable 
interested parties to explore the importance of new 
variables, and study how the effect of previously studied 
variables changes as services work to improve the way 
they are organised. For the first time, NHS Digital’s latest 
annual report4 (October, 2016) includes CCG-level data 
on how stepped care is implemented. When we included 
this information in our model we found that services in 
which a high proportion of patients had some high-
intensity therapy in their course of treatment had 
significantly better outcomes than those with a low 
proportion of patients. This outcome suggests services 
should make full use of stepped care, with patients who 
do not recover after low-intensity intervention (such as 
guided self-help) being given the opportunity to be 
stepped up to high-intensity intervention (traditional 
face-to-face therapy) rather than simply be discharged. A 
similar finding emerged from analysis of data from the 
first year of the IAPT programme, when only 32 services 
were available.21 Future IAPT reports are likely to include 
funding information, which could be included in 
statistical models.
In line with previous research,22 we found that social 
deprivation is a significant predictor of outcome. 
Although acting on social deprivation is a matter for 
local and national policy and economic development, 
some of its effects on outcome could possibly be 
mitigated by ensuring that IAPT services in socially 
deprived areas are of high quality and adequately funded. 
Consistent with this, we found that the effect sizes for 
social deprivation as a predictor of outcome were about 
halved in the multiple regressions compared with the 
single regressions.
IAPT is a rare example of consistent outcome 
monitoring and reporting in routine mental health 
services. Initially, many practitioners were sceptical about 
the feasibility of obtaining outcome data from almost all 
patients treated by IAPT services. This scepticism was 
understandable because previous attempts that were 
based on data collection at only the start and end of 
treatment were associated with high rates of missing data 
for after treatment.7 Furthermore, evidence that people 
who failed to provide data after treatment tended to have a 
poorer clinical outcome was worrying.23 IAPT manages to 
obtain an end of treatment symptom measure for almost 
everyone (98%) who has a course of treatment by the 
simple manoeuvre of asking patients to complete 
symptom measures every time they are seen.
Now that the possibility to obtain more or less complete 
outcome data is clear, and that these data can be used to 
identify potential ways to improve patients’ outcomes, we 
hope mental health services elsewhere in the UK and 
other countries will consider adopting a similar approach 
to data collection and reporting. In England the IAPT 
dataset has greatly improved public transparency about 
the mental health outcomes associated with routinely 
delivered psychological therapies. Patients can see what 
their local service offers and the outcomes it achieves. 
Commissioners and clinicians working in the services can 
now benchmark their service against others and consider 
the development of collaborative networks in which 
services come together to discuss common problems and 
learn from each other’s solutions.
Our study has some limitations. Because patient-level 
data were not available, we could not simultaneously 
estimate the effects on outcome of both patient-level 
variables (such as initial symptom severity, sex, age, and 
anxiety measures) and service organisation factors. 
However, we were able to show that the severity of clinical 
problems that services treat varied very little and that 
this omission cannot explain our findings. Outcome 
assessment was restricted to patient self-report. Although 
our analyses illustrate potential gains achievable in the 
worst-performing CCGs by bringing their organisational 
characteristics to the level shown by the best-performing 
ones, we acknowledge that these are predictions that will 
need to be further tested.
Before IAPT, little was known about the outcomes 
achieved in routine mental health services. The session-
by-session outcome monitoring system used in IAPT 
enables the services to collect outcome data from almost 
everyone. Publication of this data is improving public 
transparency and also allows analyses to be done that 
help us to understand, and hopefully reduce, local 
variability in mental health outcomes.
