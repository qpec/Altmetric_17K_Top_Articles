Highlights: 
 In our meta-analysis, weight loss was associated with an improvement in attention and 
memory. 
 Executive function and language improved in longitudinal and RCT studies, 
respectively. 
 Intentional weight loss should be promoted in obese/ overweight people 
 
ABSTRACT (164/170) 
Whilst obesity is associated with a higher risk of cognitive impairment, the influence of 
weight loss on cognitive function in obese/overweight people is equivocal. We conducted a 
meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and longitudinal studies evaluating the 
influence of voluntary weight loss on cognitive function in obese/overweight individuals.  
Articles were acquired from a systematic search of major databases from inception till 
01/2016. A random effect meta-analysis of weight loss interventions (diet, physical activity, 
bariatric surgery) on different cognitive domains (memory, attention, executive functions, 
language and motor speed) was conducted. Twenty studies (13 longitudinal studies=551 
participants; 7 RCTs= 328 treated vs. 140 controls) were included. Weight loss was 
associated with a significant improvement in attention and memory in both longitudinal 
studies and RCTs, whereas executive function and language improved in longitudinal and 
RCT studies, respectively. In conclusion, intentional weight loss in obese/ overweight people 
is associated with improvements in performance across various cognitive domains.  Future 
adequately powered RCTs are required to confirm/ refute these findings.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The prevalence of overweight and obesity is high and increasing in all age groups, including 
the elderly (Nguyen and El-Serag, 2010; WHO consultation, 2000). Several medical 
complications are associated with excessive adiposity, including type 2 diabetes (Chan et al., 
1994), cardiovascular diseases (Eckel, 1997), cancer (Renehan, Nature Review Cancer 2015), 
cognitive impairment (Xu et al., 2011), and premature mortality (Fontana and Hu, 2014; Ng et 
al., 2014).   
Weight loss remains the cornerstone for the treatment of obesity, and can be achieved through 
several interventions, such as calorie restriction and/or physical exercise, and in extreme cases 
bariatric surgery. Weight loss is associated with improvements in multiple metabolic factors 
(i.e. glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, oxidative stress, and inflammation), 
which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment and dementia ( 
Ceriello et al., 2014; Bennett et al., 2009; Schmidt et al., 2002).  
However, the potential cognitive benefits of weight loss are still unclear and largely limited to 
those associated with weight loss from physical activity alone. Higher physical activity level 
seems to be able to increase gray and white matter volume in the prefrontal cortex (Colcombe 
et al., 2006) and is associated with greater sparing of prefrontal and temporal brain regions 
(Erickson et al., 2010). Moreover, exercise training increases cerebral blood volume (Burdette 
et al., 2010) and perfusion of the hippocampus (Pereira et al., 2007), one of the most 
important organ in the control of food intake. If these anatomical changes correspond to better 
cognitive function is, however, not fully understood.  
A previous systematic review and meta-analysis with a search date of over 5 years ago 
(Siervo et al., 2011) found that weight loss had a beneficial effect on some cognitive domains, 
particularly among obese individuals. Whilst this previous study advanced the field, the 
authors relied on conclusions based on observational studies and did not include data from 
randomized control trials (RCTs).  Whilst inferences from observational data are helpful, the 
 4 
 
certitude of any relationship between weight loss and cognition from such data is limited.  
RCTs enable causal inferences to be asserted and therefore, a meta-analysis of interventional 
data may offer additional information beyond that of observational data.  Moreover, these 
authors did not investigate the influence of different weight loss strategies on cognitive 
performance outcomes.  Understanding the potential impact of different weight loss strategies 
would offer new and important information.   
We therefore aimed to investigate the effect of intentional weight loss on cognitive status 
assessed through validated scales in overweight and obese people across observational and 
interventional studies. We hypothesized that weight loss would be beneficial for cognition in 
obese/overweight individuals.  
 
2.MATERIALS AND METHODS 
This systematic review was conducted according to the Strengthening the Reporting of 
Observational Studies in Epidemiology [STROBE] criteria (von Elm et al., 2008) and the 
recommendations in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses [PRISMA] statement (Liberati et al., 2009). 
 
2.1 Search strategy 
Two investigators (NV, SF) independently conducted an electronic literature search using 
EMBASE, PubMed and Scopus with no language restrictions, from their inception until 
02/01/2016, searching studies providing data on intentional weight loss on cognitive 
parameters in obese and overweight people. Any inconsistency was resolved by consensus.  
In PubMed, the following controlled vocabulary terms and keywords were considered: (obese 
or overweight) and (weight loss) and (cognit*).   
A similar search strategy was performed in the other databases. Reference lists of the articles 
included in the analysis and of others papers relevant to the topic were hand-searched to 
 5 
 
identify additional, potentially relevant publications. Conference abstracts were also 
considered. 
 
2.2 Study selection 
We only considered studies that: (1) included overweight and obese people before any weight 
loss intervention, defined through a body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 29.9 and a 
BMI>30 kg/m2 (WHO consultation,2000), respectively; (2) reported data on any cognitive 
domain (e.g. attention, executive function, memory, motor speed, language and global 
cognition) assessed through validated scales before and after a weight loss intervention 
program, (3) longitudinal or interventional studies using diet, calorie restriction, increased 
physical activity  or bariatric surgery as interventions; (4) reported at least 2 Kg of weight loss 
(i.e. clinically significant weight loss) (Siervo et al., 2011) in the treated group between 
follow-up and baseline.  
 
We excluded studies for the following reasons: (1) non validated scales for assessing 
cognition; (2) unintentional weight loss (i.e. not voluntary weight loss, for example due to an 
illness); (3) use of pharmacological interventions for losing weight; (4) no human subjects 
included.  
Where data about baseline or follow-up tests were not available, the first and corresponding 
authors of each paper were contacted at least 4 times in a month period. All of the five authors 
we contacted gave us the additional information on the meta-analysis (see the 
Acknowledgments section).   
 
2.3 Data extraction 
Two authors (MS, CL) independently extracted data from the selected studies in a 
standardized Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Any disagreement was resolved by consensus with 
 6 
 
a third author (BS). The following information was extracted: i) characteristics of the study 
population (e.g. sample size, demographics, country in which the study was performed); ii) 
type of intervention (diet, calorie restriction, physical activity, bariatric surgery or mixed 
interventions); iii) mean duration of follow-up; iv) mean BMI at baseline and at follow-up; v) 
tests used for the assessment of cognitive status.   
 
2.4 Outcomes 
The primary outcomes were the results at follow-up evaluation of any cognitive tests assessed 
through validated scales. Cognitive tests were categorized according to their nature in global, 
attention, executive function, memory, motor speed, and language domains. For longitudinal 
studies, a comparison of the values between follow-up and baseline evaluations (with-in 
groups), while in randomized controlled trials a comparison between the final values of 
cognitive tests (among-groups analyses) were analyzed in line with the Cochrane reviewer 
handbook recommendations (Higgins and Green, 2008).  
2.5 Assessment of study quality 
Study quality was assessed by two investigators (SF, CL), while another one was available for 
mediation (NV).  
For longitudinal studies, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) (Wells et al., 2012) was used to 
assess study quality. The NOS assigns a maximum of 9 points based on three quality 
parameters: selection, comparability, and outcome.  
The quality of RCTs was assessed through the Jadad’s scale (Jadad et al., 1996), although we 
did not consider blinding among the parameters of quality, having 3 points (2 for 
randomization and one for dropouts) consequently available.

2.6 Statistical analysis 
The meta-analysis was performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 3.0 (CMA 3.0) 
[http://www.meta-analysis.com/index.php]. When combining studies, the random effect 
model was used to account for anticipated heterogeneity (DerSimonian and Laird, 1986). For 
cognitive data at follow-up, means and standard deviations (SD) at follow-up (compared to 
baseline in longitudinal and with the control group in RCTs) were analyzed to calculate 
standardized mean differences [SMD].  
These estimates were calculated also for each type of intervention (diet, calorie restriction, 
physical activity, bariatric surgery or mixed interventions). All estimates were calculated 
together with 95% confidence intervals [CI]. 
 
Study heterogeneity was measured using the chi-squared and I-squared statistics, assuming 
that a p≤0.05 for the former and a value ≥50% for the latter indicated a significant 
heterogeneity (Higgins and Thompson, 2002). Since the previous meta-analysis by Siervo and 
colleagues (Siervo et al., 2011) suggested that the effect of weight loss on cognition was 
significant only in obese people, we tested if baseline BMI in longitudinal studies (or 
differences of BMI between treated and control groups in RCTs) could moderate our results.   
Publication bias was assessed by visually inspecting funnel plots and by using the Begg-
Mazumdar Kendall tau (Begg and Mazumdar, 1994)  and the Egger bias tests (Egger et al., 
1997). Additionally, to account for publication bias, we used the trim-and-fill method, based 
on the assumption that the effect sizes of all the studies were normally distributed around the 
center of a funnel plot; in the event of asymmetry, this method adjusts for the potential effect 
of unpublished (trimmed) studies (Egger et al., 1997). Finally, we calculated the fail safe 
number of negative studies that would be required to nullify each of our comparative analyses 
(i.e., result in p>0.05) (Rosenthal, 1979).

3. RESULTS 
The search identified 1,674 potentially eligible studies, including 424 duplicate studies which 
were rejected. After excluding 1,209 papers on the grounds of a review of their titles and 
abstracts, 41 full-text articles were examined, and 20 studies were ultimately included in our 
meta-analysis (Figure 1) (Alosco et al., 2014; Boraxbekk et al., 2015; Brinkworth et al., 
2009; Bryan and Tiggemann, 2001; Buffenstein et al., 2000; Cheatham et al., 2009; Green 
and Elliman, 2012; Guldstrand et al., 2003; Halyburton et al., 2007; Kretsch et al., 1997; 
Marques et al., 2014; Martin et al., 2009; Miller et al., 2013; Napoli et al., 2014; Prehn et al., 
2016; Siervo et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2010; Spitznagel et al., 2014; Wing et al., 1995; Witte 
et al., 2009).   
 
3.1 Study and patient characteristics 
Study and patient characteristics are summarized in Supplementary Table 1 (longitudinal 
studies) and 2 (RCTs).  
The 13 longitudinal studies (Alosco et al., 2014; Boraxbekk et al., 2015; Brinkworth et al., 
2009; Buffenstein et al., 2000; Cheatham et al., 2009; Guldstrand et al., 2003; Halyburton et 
al., 2007; Kretsch et al., 1997; Marques et al., 2014; Miller et al., 2013; Siervo et al., 2012; 
Spitznagel et al., 2014; Wing et al., 1995) included 551 participants, while the 7 RCTs (Bryan 
and Tiggemann, 2001; Green and Elliman, 2012; Martin et al., 2009; Napoli et al., 2014; 
Prehn et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2010; Witte et al., 2009) encompassed 468 individuals (328 in 
the treated groups and 140 controls), representing a total of 1,019 participants with obesity or 
being overweight at baseline. The mean age was 50.0 (standard deviation, SD=10.7) years, 
and the included participants were predominantly women (=78.3%).  
The majority of these studies were conducted in North America (8 studies: 6 longitudinal and 
2 RCTs), followed by 7 studies (3 longitudinal and 4 RCTs) performed in Europe, 3 in 
Oceania (2 longitudinal and one RCT), one longitudinal study in South Africa and another 
 9 
 
one in Brazil (Supplementary Tables 1-2).  In only one study (Napoli et al., 2014), people 
older than 65 years of age were included.  
The interventions used across the studies were diet (n=13 studies; 538 participants [326 in 8 
longitudinal and 212 in 5 RCTs]), bariatric surgery (n=5 longitudinal studies with 225 
participants) and multi-interventions in the remaining 2 RCTs with 116 participants (i.e. one 
group treated with diet, one with physical activity regimen or mixed intervention). A total of 
140 participants were allocated to a control group (Supplementary Tables 1-2).  
 
3.2 Longitudinal studies reporting on the effect of weight loss on cognition 
The 13 longitudinal studies (Alosco et al., 2014; Boraxbekk et al., 2015; Brinkworth et al., 
2009; Buffenstein et al., 2000; Cheatham et al., 2009; Guldstrand et al., 2003; Halyburton et 
al., 2007; Kretsch et al., 1997; Marques et al., 2014; Miller et al., 2013; Siervo et al., 2012; 
Spitznagel et al., 2014; Wing et al., 1995) followed-up 551 participants with a mean age of 
46.3 (SD=12.8) years, predominantly women, for a median of 24 (range: 4-144) weeks. The 
BMI significantly decreased across the studies by 7 Kg/m2 (from 37.2 at baseline to 30.9 at 
follow-up). The quality, assessed with the NOS, was moderate, with a median score of 6 
(Supplementary Table 1).  
Table 1 shows the results of weight loss interventions on cognition in prospective studies. 
Weight loss interventions improved attention domains in nine studies (Alosco et al., 2014; 
Buffenstein et al., 2000; Cheatham et al., 2009; Kretsch et al., 1997; Marques et al., 2014; 
Miller et al., 2013; Siervo et al., 2012; Spitznagel et al., 2014; Wing et al., 1995) involving 
337 participants (SMD=0.30; 95%CI: 0.15-0.44, p<0.0001; I2=64%), with the five studies 
using a dietary intervention (Buffenstein et al., 2000; Cheatham et al., 2009; Kretsch et al., 
1997; Siervo et al., 2012; Wing et al., 1995).  The dietary intervention impact on attention was 
more pronounced than the four (Alosco et al., 2014; Marques et al., 2014; Miller et al., 2013; 
Spitznagel et al., 2014) using bariatric surgery (diet: SMD=0.42; 95%CI: 0.13-0.71, p=0.005; 
 10 
 
I2=58%; bariatric surgery: SMD=0.26; 95%CI: 0.08-0.44, p=0.004; I2=68%). Similar findings 
were evident for executive function. Seven studies exploring the effects of dietary calorie 
restriction (Alosco et al., 2014; Brinkworth et al., 2009; Cheatham et al., 2009; Guldstrand et 
al., 2003; Miller et al., 2013; Spitznagel et al., 2014; Wing et al., 1995) with 546 participants 
(SMD=0.49; 95%CI: 0.29-0.68, p<0.0001; I2=72%) showed a larger effect compared to 
bariatric surgery (diet: 388 participants; SMD=0.64; 95%CI: 0.32-0.96, p<0.0001; I2=79%; 
bariatric surgery: 158 participants; SMD=0.40; 95%CI: 0.16-0.64, p=0.001; I2=38%). Finally, 
weight loss induced primarily by dietary interventions seems to be associated with improved 
memory domains in five studies (Alosco et al., 2014; Boraxbekk et al., 2015; Kretsch et al., 
1997; Miller et al., 2013; Spitznagel et al., 2014) (234 individuals; SMD=0.66; 95%CI: 0.48-
0.83, p<0.0001; I2=63%) (Table 2). 
Conversely, weight loss interventions did not significantly improve motor speed (7 studies 
only with dietary interventions; (Alosco et al., 2014; Buffenstein et al., 2000; Cheatham et al., 
2009; Kretsch et al., 1997; Marques et al., 2014; Miller et al., 2013; Siervo et al., 2012; 
Spitznagel et al., 2014; Wing et al., 1995); SMD=0.13; 95%CI: -0.37-0.10, p=0.10; I2=69%) 
and language (3 studies only with bariatric surgery; (Alosco et al., 2014; Miller et al., 2013; 
Spitznagel et al., 2014); SMD=0.08; 95%CI: -0.06 to 0.22, p=0.27; I2=0%) parameters. 
Publication bias seems to be unlikely for all the outcomes investigated and the trim and fill 
analysis did not significantly change our findings (Table 2). The failsafe number was over 
200 for all significant outcomes.  
 
3.3 Randomized controlled trials on the effect of weight loss on cognition 
As shown in Supplementary Table 2, the seven RCTs (Bryan and Tiggemann, 2001; Green 
and Elliman, 2012; Martin et al., 2009; Napoli et al., 2014; Prehn et al., 2016; Smith et al., 
2010; Witte et al., 2009) included 328 participants randomized to treated groups (262 in a 
dietary intervention group, 26 treated with physical activity, and 40 with both interventions).  
 11 
 
The treated groups were on average 53.8 (SD=11.5) years old with two thirds being women 
(67.6%), which was similar to those randomized as controls (mean age, 53.9 (SD=12.7) years; 
women: 78.1%). After a median of 20 weeks of follow-up (range:8-48), the treated 
participants had a decrease of about 2.5 Kg/m2 of BMI, while the controls only experienced a 
1.0 Kg/m2 reduction (p<0.0001 between groups). Regarding quality, using the Jadad’s scale 
for this evaluation, one study reported 3 points over 3 available, one only one point and the 
others 2 points. Taking the controls as reference, four studies (Bryan and Tiggemann, 2001; 
Green and Elliman, 2012; Prehn et al., 2016; Napoli et al., 2014) reported a significant 
improvement in attention parameters in the treated group (222 treated vs. 104 controls; 
SMD=0.44; 95%CI: 0.26-0.62, p<0.0001; I2=60%) (Table 2). However, only physical 
activity alone, and diet and physical activity together, were able to improve these outcomes in 
one study (Napoli et al., 2014). 
Treated participants showed significant improvements in memory tests (Bryan and 
Tiggemann, 2001; Green and Elliman, 2012; Martin et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2010; Witte et 
al., 2009) (236 treated vs. 113 controls; SMD=0.35; 95%CI: 0.12-0.57, p=0.002; I2=64%), 
particularly when diet and calorie restriction were used (204 treated vs. 113 controls; 
SMD=0.37; 95%CI: 0.09-0.35, p=0.01; I2=71%). This outcome, however, seemed to be 
affected by publication bias (Egger’s test=3.72±0.68; p=0.004), likely due to the inclusion of 
studies reporting negative findings. The trim and fill procedure, in fact, increased the SMD to 
0.61 (95%CI: 0.37-0.86) with 3 studies trimmed (Table 2).   
Finally, treated participants experienced a significant improvement in language parameters (4 
studies (Bryan and Tiggemann, 2001; Prehn et al., 2016; Napoli et al., 2014; Smith et al., 
2010) (222 treated individuals vs. 104 controls; SMD=0.21; 95%CI: 0.05-0.37, p=0.009; 
I2=73%), particularly in one study using physical activity and a mixed intervention (Napoli et 
al., 2014). Language domains analysis suffered of publication bias as well, but the trim and 
fill procedure did not change our results (SMD=0.32; 95%CI: 0.03-0.61).

3.4 Descriptive findings 
Few studies investigated the effect of weight loss on global scales of cognition. One RCT 
reported data on global aspects of cognition showing that the 3MS improved more in the diet, 
exercise, and diet-exercise groups than in the control group (Napoli et al., 2014). Similarly, 
the findings of a longitudinal study (Siervo et al., 2012) showed that weight loss was 
associated with significant improvements in Mini-Mental State Examination. 
 
3.5 Meta-regression  
Almost all the outcomes included in our meta-analysis revealed a moderate-high 
heterogeneity as indicated by I2>50%. As shown in Supplementary Table 4, however, 
baseline BMI in longitudinal studies and differences in BMI between treated and control 
groups in RCTs did not moderate any of these outcomes.  
 
4. DISCUSSION 
In this meta-analysis involving 20 studies and more than 1,000 obese and overweight 
subjects, weight loss appears to confer a beneficial influence on cognitive function. Although 
our findings were heterogeneous, in longitudinal studies weight loss improved attention, 
executive function and memory, while in RCTs, weight loss also result in improved language 
items. The high failsafe number indicates that many negative studies would be required to 
nullify our main results (i.e. take p>0.05), indicating our results are robust.  Altogether, our 
findings suggest that weight loss is associated with improvement in cognition. However, in 
the absence of large-scale clinical trials, our findings should be interpreted cautiously and it 
remains a challenge to decipher if the improvements in cognition are due to the respective 
interventions or weight loss itself. 
 
 13 
 
Accumulating data suggest that overweight and obesity are associated with cognitive decline, 
and with a higher incidence of vascular dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, particularly among 
middle aged subjects (Pedditizi et al., 2016). In a large systematic-review and meta-analysis 
of 21 studies and 62,425 individuals, being obese was associated with a ~40% increased risk 
of incident dementia in people below the age of 65 years, but the opposite was seen in those 
aged 65 and over, in which obesity reduced the risk of dementia of about 17% (Pedditizi et 
al., 2016). This finding agrees with our results, since the mean age of the subjects included in 
our analyses was about 50 years, and did not include any study made only in those over 65 
years. Thus, the effect of weight loss may be particularly beneficial among middle-aged 
subjects at higher risk of poor cognitive status. Moreover, our data suggest that weight loss 
over a relatively shorter period of time can result in improvements in cognitive outcomes.  
However, whether or not weight loss interventions with diet and exercise in the long term can 
reduce the incidence of dementia specifically among obese people warrants further 
exploration.  Within our analyses, it appears there might be some variation in the benefits 
induced by different weight loss interventions on cognitive performance. It appears, for 
example, that nutritional interventions have a particularly  powerful influence in improving 
cognition outcomes across the longitudinal studies. Unfortunately, there was limited data on 
physical activity and cognitive outcomes in our data set, thus precluding any definitive 
conclusions regarding these outcomes in obese adults.   Given this, there is a need for future 
studies to investigate the comparative effectiveness of different weight loss strategies on 
cognition, both in isolation and in combination.  Such research should also seek to clarify the 
potential neurobiological mechanisms that underlie the observed improvements in cognition, 
since to date the exact mechanisms remain unclear.   
Our data builds upon a previous systematic review in several ways (Siervo et al., 2011). First, 
our meta-analysis included 20 studies and over 1000 participant’s, while Siervo et al. only 
included 12 studies and 343 participants. Moreover, our study investigated the influence of 
 14 
 
weight loss on several cognitive domains not previously considered (e.g. attention and 
executive functions as separated domains, and motor speed and language as new facets of 
cognition).  Moreover, we  accounted for publication bias, and investigated sources of 
heterogeneity with meta regression analyses.  In addition, we considered data from RCTs, 
which enables stronger inferences to be made than relying purely on observational data.  
Finally, five author groups provided additional data for our meta-analysis, thus the current 
meta-analysis has advanced the field beyond the knowledge, which is publically available.   
Intentional weight loss could be beneficial for overweight and obese subjects through several 
mechanisms. First, weight loss reduces insulin resistance which has been associated with 
poorer cognitive status (Biessels and Reagan, 2015). Insulin resistance, , is associated with 
lower cerebral glucose metabolism rate in pre-diabetic and diabetic subjects (Baker et al., 
2011). Moreover, insulin regulates the activity of a number of brain areas relevant for 
memory, reward, eating behavior and the regulation of whole-body metabolism (Heni et al., 
2015). Second, weight loss reduces inflammatory and oxidative stress, and increases serum 
adiponectin concentration. Inflammation and oxidative stress seem to play a pivotal role in the 
pathogenesis of cognitive decline (Bennett et al., 2009; Schmidt et al., 2002). Moreover, in 
Alzheimer's disease-transgenic mice adiponectin has been shown to be neuroprotective for 
hippocampal cells (Letra et al., 2014). Therefore, the modulation of these cytokines and 
adipokines through weight loss could contribute, at least in part, to the improvement in the 
cognitive tests observed in the treated subjects, and influence brain function and structure in 
obese and overweight subjects (Bischof and Park, 2015).  Future research is required to 
disentangle the potential neurobiological mechanisms through which weight loss influences 
cognition.   
The findings of our meta-analysis should be interpreted within its limitations. First, we were 
unable to assess the impact of weight loss on preventing dementia and Alzheimer’s disease 
due to the lack of data. Second, the mean duration of the studies was usually short, the sample 
 15 
 
was often limited in size, and a gender bias was present. Third, the great majority of the 
observational studies investigated the effect of dietary restriction or bariatric surgery, with 
few studies addressing the effect of physical activity programs on cognition.  .  Finally, many 
of the outcomes studied demonstrated to be moderate/highly heterogeneous, and our meta 
regression analyses could not completely explain. . Interestingly, the effect of weight loss on 
cognition seems not to be moderated by the baseline BMI, suggesting that weight loss is 
beneficial in both overweight and obese subjects.  
 
In conclusion, our data suggest that intentional weight loss among obese and overweight 
individuals is associated with improvements in cognitive performance across different 
cognitive domains across observational studies and randomized clinical trials. More studies 
with a longer follow-up duration are required, with a particular emphasis on RCTs which seek 
to understand the neurobiological underpinnings of any improvements in cognition from 
weight loss.  Such research should attempt to disentangle the extent to which improvements 
from weight loss are attributable to weight loss and individual intervention mechanisms. An 
area of interest might be whether weight loss in midlife can improve cognition sufficiently to 
prevent the onset of  Alzheimer’s disease.
