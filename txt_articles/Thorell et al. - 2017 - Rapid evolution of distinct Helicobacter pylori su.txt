Abstract
For the last 500 years, the Americas have been a melting pot both for genetically diverse
humans and for the pathogenic and commensal organisms associated with them. One such
organism is the stomach-dwelling bacterium Helicobacter pylori, which is highly prevalent in
Latin America where it is a major current public health challenge because of its strong asso-
ciation with gastric cancer. By analyzing the genome sequence of H. pylori isolated in North,
Central and South America, we found evidence for admixture between H. pylori of European
and African origin throughout the Americas, without substantial input from pre-Columbian
(hspAmerind) bacteria. In the US, strains of African and European origin have remained
genetically distinct, while in Colombia and Nicaragua, bottlenecks and rampant genetic
exchange amongst isolates have led to the formation of national gene pools. We found
three outer membrane proteins with atypical levels of Asian ancestry in American strains, as
well as alleles that were nearly fixed specifically in South American isolates, suggesting a
role for the ethnic makeup of hosts in the colonization of incoming strains. Our results show
that new H. pylori subpopulations can rapidly arise, spread and adapt during times of demo-
graphic flux, and suggest that differences in transmission ecology between high and low
prevalence areas may substantially affect the composition of bacterial populations.
Author summary
Helicobacter pylori is one of the best studied examples of an intimate association between
bacteria and humans, due to its ability to colonize the stomach for decades and to transmit

 from generation to generation. A number of studies have sought to link diversity in H.
pylori to human migrations but there are some discordant signals such as an “out of
Africa” dispersal within the last few thousand years that has left a much stronger signal in
bacterial genomes than in human ones. In order to understand how such discrepancies
arise, we have investigated the evolution of H. pylori during the recent colonization of the
Americas. We find that bacterial populations evolve quickly and can spread rapidly to
people of different ethnicities. Distinct new bacterial subpopulations have formed in
Colombia from a European source and in Nicaragua and the US from African sources.
Genetic exchange between bacterial populations is rampant within Central and South
America but is uncommon within North America, which may reflect differences in preva-
lence. Our results also suggest that adaptation of bacteria to particular human ethnic
groups may be confined to a handful of genes involved in interaction with the immune
system.
Introduction
In 1492, Christopher Columbus initiated a rapid colonization of the New World, principally
by European migrants and Africans brought as slaves that had catastrophic consequences for
the indigenous population. The new migrants brought unfamiliar weapons and pathogens [1],
including new populations of the stomach-colonizing bacterium Helicobacter pylori. H. pylori
can persist for decades in the stomach, and is often transmitted vertically from parent to child
but can also be acquired from individuals in close proximity. H. pylori evolves rapidly by both
mutation and homologous recombination with other co-colonizing strains [2].
Studies of the global diversity of H. pylori have shown that Europeans, Africans and Native
Americans carry genetically distinct populations of bacteria; named hpEurope, hpAfrica1 and
hpAfrica2, and hspAmerind, respectively [3]. The relationships between bacterial populations
reflect differentiation that has arisen during the complex migration history of humans, with
the prefix “hp” indicating a population and “hsp” indicating a subpopulation, which are genet-
ically distinct from each other but less differentiated than populations. hspAmerind bacteria
are presumed to be descendants of the strains present in the Americas prior to 1492, and are a
subpopulation of hspEAsia, which is found in Asian countries such as China and Japan. How-
ever, these strains are rare even within groups with substantial Native American ancestry and
may being dying out in competition with other strains, due to low diversity within the popula-
tion or other factors [4]. hpEurope bacteria are themselves ancient hybrids between two popu-
lations, whose close relatives are currently found in unadmixed populations in North East
Africa (hpNEAfrica) and central Asia (hpAsia2). The Tyrolean Iceman, O
¨ tzi, who died 5300
years ago in central Europe, was infected by an hpAsia2 strain with little or no African ancestry
[5], suggesting that the admixture probably took place within the last few thousand years.
In Latin America, gastric cancer is a leading cause of cancer death, and some countries in
the region have among the highest mortality rates worldwide [6]. However, the mortality rates
vary in different geographic regions, both between neighboring countries and within nations
[6,7]. Several studies have been performed comparing H. pylori ancestry in high- and low risk
areas and have linked phylogeographic origin of the bacteria, as well as discordant origin of
bacteria and host, to increased risk of gastric cancer development [3,8]. However, these studies
have been performed using MLST analysis that, being based only on seven housekeeping
genes, is limited in its resolution compared to whole-genome comparisons.

 To investigate if American H. pylori strains have differentiated from those found in the Old
World by mixture, genetic drift or natural selection, we combined hundreds of publicly avail-
able genomes with over hundred newly sequenced genomes of H. pylori sampled in Latin
America (Mexico, Nicaragua, and Colombia), Europe, and Central Asia. We show that the
American bacterial populations have undergone substantial evolution within 500 years and
our results also suggest that H. pylori transmission biology has been as important as human
migration in determining extant patterns of diversity.
Results
We used the Chromopainter/fineSTRUCTURE pipeline [9,10] to assess the population structure
within our global collection of isolates (n = 401, described in S1 Table). Insight into the ancestry
of each isolate is obtained by treating it as a “recipient” and using Chromopainter to fit it as a
mosaic of DNA chunks, i.e. sets of contiguous SNPs, from a “donor panel” of other genomes.
The painting can be interpreted genealogically as described in more detail in [9], namely in the
local genealogy for any of the sites within a given chunk, the most recent coalescence involving
the recipient individual is with the donor individual for that chunk. Each chunk thus provides
information on the most recent clonal relationships and/or genetic exchange between different
strains in the sample. In H. pylori recombination rates are very high and unless individuals in
close proximity are sampled, it is rare to find clear evidence of direct clonal descent [11].
We used two different donor panels. A first consisted only of Old World (European, Afri-
can and Asian) isolates. Since we expect that almost all of the gene flow historically has been
from the Old World to the New World, using an Old World panel allows us to investigate the
origins of each New World H. pylori, without the complication of determining how the strains
are related to each other. Although we are principally interested in gene flow within the last
500 years, hspAmerind strains are excluded from the donor set because many of the strains
have undergone post-Columbian admixture with other populations. The DNA in any case
originated from the Old World, albeit probably > 10,000 years ago.
The second global painting panel includes all New World strains, apart from the specific
individual being painted. Many, although not all of the chunks inferred to be donated by other
New World strains in this painting will represent coalescent events that happened in the New
World. Therefore using this painting panel allows us to investigate recent demography within
the New World.
fineSTRUCTURE uses the output of Chromopainter to assign individuals to populations
with distinct ancestry profiles. We applied fineSTRUCTURE to the global painting to identify
subpopulations in the dataset (Fig 1). In order to make display and reporting of the results trac-
table, we merged the most similar populations until 12 distinct populations remained, 5 of
which are restricted to the New World. The “palette” of each strain, representing the proportion
of chunks that come from each population in the donor panel, was determined for both the Old
World (Fig 2A) and the Global (Fig 2B) painting. One of the twelve populations, hspMiscAmer-
ica, contains isolates that are not particularly closely related to each other and should not be
thought of as a coherent population (Fig 1). The fineSTRUCTURE results are congruent with
those obtained by Principal Component Analysis, PCA, which show differences between the
subpopulations within the first 5 Principal Components (S1 Fig) but are easier to interpret.
Increased number of isolates reveals substructures in the Old World
populations
Each of the 7 populations found in the Old World has been reported previously with the excep-
tion that, with the addition of the large number of isolates in this study, hpEurope isolates

 separated into two distinct groups, which we provisionally label hspEuropeN and hspEuropeS
(Fig 1). Our geographical sampling within Europe is limited but this split is likely to reflect the
previously observed North to South gene frequency cline [12,13], with the hspEuropeS isolates
having a larger fraction of their palette from African populations and hspEuropeN having a
higher proportion from hpAsia2. The other five populations, hpAfrica2, hspAfrica1SAfrica,
hspAfrica1WAfrica, hpEastAsia and hpAsia2 are highly distinct from each other, each receiv-
ing more than half of their palette from their own population in the Old World painting.
Distinct subpopulations of mixed hpEurope and hpAfrica1 ancestry in
American H. pylori
Among the isolates from the Americas, five additional subpopulations could be distinguished;
four have palettes consistent with being European/African hybrids, according to the Old
Fig 1. Population structure of global H. pylori strains. The colour of each cell of the matrix indicates the expected number of DNA chunks imported from
a donor genome (column) to a recipient genome (row). The boundaries between named populations are marked with lines, with New World populations
marked with an asterisk. The colour bar on the left indicates the geographical locations where the strains were sampled.

 World painting (Fig 2A). The population with the highest African ancestry is hspAfrica1NA-
merica, isolated from 30 individuals in the US, one in Canada, one in Nicaragua, and one in
Colombia, followed by hspAfrica1Nicaragua, which only contains isolates from Nicaragua;
hspMiscAmerica, which consists of a number of strains of Mexican and Colombian origin; and
hspEuropeColombia, which contains most of the Colombian isolates in our data set, and has a
palette similar to hspEuropeS (Fig 1). The fifth population, hspAmerind, has a palette similar
to hpEastAsia but with more hpEurope ancestry. These results are congruent to those obtained
using D statistics (Table 1), which also imply that European and post-Colombian New World
subpopulations are hybrids.

 In our sample, several isolates from the Americas cluster within the two hpEurope subpop-
ulations (Fig 1). The hpEurope strains from North America largely cluster with hspEuropeN
while those from Central and Southern America cluster with hspEuropeS. There was also sub-
stantial variation in the proportion of the genomic palette stemming from hspAfrica1WAfrica
and hspAfrica1SAfrica, both between and within New World populations. hspAfrica1WAfrica
is the major African source in isolates from hspMiscAmerica, hspEuropeColombia as well as
hspEuropeS while hspAfrica1SAfrica is a more important source for hspAfrica1NAmerica and
hspAfrica1Nicaragua populations. A handful of isolates from both hspEuropeColombia and
hspAfrica1Nicaragua populations have elevated hspAfrica1SAfrica proportions, consistent
with recent genetic mixture (Fig 2A).
The distinct New World subpopulations show evidence of both drift and
mixture
In the global painting, the strains from the New World populations received a large proportion
from their palette from within their own subpopulation, meaning that they have differentiated
both from the Old World isolates as well as from the other New World subpopulations. The
formation of differentiated populations in the Americas is suggestive of recent demographic
bottlenecks (see discussion below) but the New World populations have nucleotide diversity
as high as or slightly higher than the Old World populations from which they evolved (Fig 3),
presumably because the diversity lost in bottlenecks has been replaced by admixture.
Identifying the components of the ancestry of the New World populations that have under-
gone higher levels of drift provides insight into the process of differentiation. Drift is likely to
be caused by the expansion of particular clones or lineages, for example, due to transmission
bottlenecks. Specifically, we focused on signatures of DNA that had the most recent coalescent
with other members within the same population. We tabulated the proportion of such sites
with each distinct ancestry source in the Old World painting that were inferred to instead be
derived from other members of their own population in the New World painting (Table 2). Bot-
tlenecks allow small numbers of clones to propagate, leading to high rates of within population
coalescence for genomes sampled from the population. This will in turn increase the proportion
of sites inferred to have donors within the same population in the New World painting, rather
than from Old World or other sources. Diversity acquired by admixture on the other hand, is
Fig 3. Pairwise sequence divergence within populations. For the two hspEurope populations only the Old World isolates are included.

 more likely to be copied from other populations, unless the admixture sources have themselves
been subject to a strong bottleneck.
For hspAfrica1NAmerica and hspAfrica1Nicaragua, the most drifted component is the
African component. The level of drift of the African component is significantly higher than
that of other components (p < 10−15 and p < 10−8 by Wilcoxon’s rank sum test in hspAfrica1-
NAmerica and hspAfrica1Nicaragua, respectively). It suggests that African lineages may have
undergone rapid demographic increases during their spread in the Americas and thus that
they may have a transmission advantage.
Aside from the isolation of hspAmerind strains from three countries and a single hspAfri-
ca1NAmerica isolate from Colombian and Nicaraguan, there was no indication of sharing of
ancestry between North, Central and South American gene pools. There is also no evidence
from the palettes of hspAmerind having contributed DNA to any other New World strains.
Amongst the Mexican isolates, a few hspMiscAmerica isolates have a substantial hspAfrica1-
NAmerica component but there is no sign of elevated ancestry from the Colombian or Nicara-
guan populations.
The palettes provide evidence of genetic mixture between populations within countries.
The hspEuropeS isolates from Nicaragua have more hspAfrica1Nicaragua in their palette than
those from other locations, while Colombian isolates that are not assigned to the hspEurope-
Colombia have a higher ratio of hspEuropeColombia/hspEuropeS than found elsewhere,
which is consistent with recent genetic exchange. Conversely, there is no evidence for elevated
hspAfrica1NAmerica ancestry in hspEuropeN isolates from North America. The hspAfrica1-
NAmerica population has more hpEurope ancestry than hpAfrica1 isolates from Africa but
there is little variation between strains, contrary to what would be expected if there was sub-
stantial ongoing gene flow.
Several genes have ancestral origin distinct from the overall core
ancestry
The spread of H. pylori populations in the Americas provides an opportunity to investigate
adaptive introgression as the bacteria encountered new populations of humans, as well as
novel diets and environmental conditions. This is of specific interest since H. pylori has an out-
standing capacity for recombination between co-colonising strains [2,14]. We performed a
scan of the core genome for genomic regions with enrichment of specific ancestry compo-
nents. To this end, we painted the strains from each New World population, using Old World
strains as donors and recorded whether the donor was European, African or Asian in origin.
We found several genes where alleles showed significantly higher or lower ancestry from
another Old world donor population than would be expected based on the overall ancestry of
that isolate (p < 10−8, Table 3). Among these were three genes that had ancestry from an unex-
pected Old World source in more than one of the New World populations. These were the

 ancestry (lowest p-value 3.5 x 10−10) in hspEuropeColombia and hspAfrica1Nicaragua popula-
tions, respectively.
To investigate the basis of the low p values in more detail, we first constructed phylogenetic
trees of the three genes. Linkage disequilibrium extends over very short distances in H. pylori
so these trees do not necessarily reflect the genealogy of the gene as a whole. Nevertheless inter-
esting patterns were found in alpB and hofC trees (Fig 4). For each gene at least one major sep-
arate clade of Latin American isolates could be observed, regardless of H. pylori population.
The tree for frpB4 can be found in S2 Fig.
For alpB there are three major clusters; one predominantly Asian cluster including a major-
ity of the Latin American strains, both Amerind isolates and isolates from the New World sub-
populations, one predominantly European cluster, also with a number of Latin American
strains, and one African cluster where isolates from Africa group together with isolates the
hspAfrica1NAmerica. Notably, in the Asian group the Latin American isolates from multiple
H. pylori populations cluster together while in the European group they are interspersed with
the other isolates (Fig 4A).
For hofC there is one clearly distinct South American clade, including all the Amerindian
strains except for Aklavik117 and a majority of the strains belonging to the New World sub-
populations hspMiscAmericas, hspAfrica1Nicaragua and hspEuropeColombia. The other
three main clades are dominated by either: (i) hspAfrica1WAfrica, hpAfrica2 and hspAfrica1-
NAmerica isolates; (ii) hspAfrica1SAfrica, European and US/Canadian hpEurope isolates or;
(iii) Asian isolates, respectively (Fig 4B). Notably, for hofC the Mexican isolates did not group
within the main South American clade but within clade i and ii.
Investigating the hofC gene alignment in more detail using Fst values revealed that the
sequence variation strongly contributing to the tree clade structure were nucleotides 826–926
of the gene. We found 10 nucleotide positions with a Fixation index of higher than 0.3 in the

among the highest out of all nucleotide positions in the core genome (Table 4).
Within this stretch, several amino acids were completely fixed in the South American clade
and were not found in the other isolates (Fig 5). The ones with strongest Fst and unique to the
South American clade were a Glutamic acid instead of a Glycine at position 278, Asparagine or
Aspartic Acid instead of Leucine at position 280, a strong tendency to have Glycine instead of
Glutamic Acid at position 292 and a Serine instead of Aspartic Acid at position 309 (Fig 5).
These changes, which in most of the cases entirely changes the residue characteristics have
spread to a large proportion of isolates in all of the populations found in South America, sug-
gesting they confer an adaptive advantage, and stand out strongly in the Fst analyses even
though this includes all Latin American isolates and not only the specific clade in the tree.
Accessory genome analysis shows similar but not identical ancestral
patterns to the core genome
Our collection of multiple genomes from each population allowed us to examine patterns of
gene presence and absence. A neighbour-joining tree based on gene sharing distance between
isolates largely recovered the populations and sub-populations identified based on core genome
sequence, but with distinct clusters for isolates carrying the Cag Pathogenicity Island (cagPAI)
positive and for cagPAI negative isolates respectively (S5 Fig). The cagPAI is an approximately
40 kb cluster of genes encoding for a Type IV secretion system. This secretion system is translo-
cating the CagA protein into host cells and has been shown to be of high importance for bacte-
rial virulence [15,16].
In order to assess whether the pan genome evolved by the same processes of clonal descent
and genetic exchange as the core genome, we examined the frequency of different pan genome
elements in different populations. Specifically, we jointly analysed the frequency genes of trip-
lets of populations, two of which are close representatives of the presumed ancestral source
population and a third putative hybrid, with projections of the resulting 3D plots shown in Fig
6. Fig 6A shows the expectations if the pan genome of the descendent population had identical
gene frequencies to either source or a 50–50 hybrid.
It has been previously shown that for the core genome, hpEurope bacteria are hybrids
between hpAsia2 and hpNEAfrica (which is related to hpAfrica1), with higher hpAsia2 ances-
try proportions in Northern Europe [12,17]. The same pattern for the pan genome could also
be observed in our analysis, where the hpEurope population has a profile that is intermediate

 between that of hpAsia2 and hpAfrica1, but with considerable variation in the pattern amongst
genes, consistent with genetic drift in the thousands of years since hybridization (Fig 6B, S1
Movie). We confirmed this visual impression using an ANOVA (S3 Table). Specifically, we
tabulated the genes that differed in frequency amongst the three populations and found that
the average deviations from equality were largest for genes with pattern showing either hpEu-
rope being similar in frequency to hpAsia2 or hpEurope being similar in frequency to
hpAfrica1.
For the New World populations, hspEuropeColombia has a profile that is intermediate
between Africa1 and European isolates (Fig 6D, S3 Movie), with the ANOVA implying that
gene frequencies are more similar to hpEurope than to hpAfrica1 (S3 Table).

Discussion
Millions of people from diverse geographical and ethnic backgrounds have migrated from the
Old World to the Americas in the last 500 years and it is likely that a majority carried H. pylori.
Transmission between ethnicities and DNA exchange between strains might be expected to
scramble the relationship between bacterial and human ancestry at the individual level, but in
the absence of selection or bottlenecks, overall H. pylori ancestry should largely recapitulate
the ancestry found in humans [12,17,18]. Consistent with this expectation, we find diverse
populations of hpEurope bacteria in Northern and Latin America, with chromosome painting
profiles comparable to those found in European isolates. We find a broad North-South divide
amongst hpEurope isolates, both in the New and Old World, with higher relatedness to hpA-
frica1 DNA in the southern populations. This is consistent with the gene frequency cline

dot shows the frequencies of an accessory gene in three populations, with the graphs orientated such that genes with identical
frequencies in all three appear at the centre of the plot. Genes with large frequency differences between populations are labelled in

 already observed in Europe and known differences in the colonization history of North and
South America [19].
However, H. pylori genomic variation does not necessarily recapitulate patterns found in
humans. The Americas constituted both a new physical and dietary environment and a new
ethnic mix of hosts. Particular bacterial lineages may have had, or acquired, traits that adapted
them to these new conditions. In extreme cases, human migrations that have little or no effect
on human ancestry might precipitate substantial changes in H. pylori populations. For exam-
ple, hspAmerind strains are rare even in populations with substantial Native American ances-
try [3]. This suggests that after more than 10,000 years of independent evolution, resident H.
pylori lineages were poorly equipped to compete with incoming lineages or with changes in
the environment caused by the new settlers. We also found evidence of substantial differentia-
tion of New World H. pylori populations from their ancestors, which suggests that there have
been bottlenecks with particular lineages contributing disproportionately to extant popula-
tions. These bottlenecks have most strongly affected African components of ancestry (Table 2),
suggesting that bacteria of African origin may have been particularly effective in colonizing the
new continent.
We identified three differentiated populations in the Americas, in addition to hspAmerind.
The hspAfrica1NAmerica population includes the non-European isolates from the US, also
found in single Canadian, Colombian and Nicaraguan isolates. This population has an ances-
try profile consistent with it being a mix of West African, South African and European sources.
However, our global chromosome painting results (Fig 2B) show that within genomic regions
of African origin, the DNA of hspAfrica1NAmerica is distinct from that found in modern
Gambian and South African populations. Differentiation at the DNA sequence level is also
found in the hspEuropeColombia and hspAfrica1Nicaragua populations, whose gene pools are
distinct from each other and from those in Mexico and Europe.
The three larger groups of samples, from Mexico (Mexico City), Nicaragua (Managua) and
Colombia (Bogota
´) respectively, were all collected at hospitals that are tertiary referral centres
for endoscopy with large catchment areas, while all but one of the US isolates came from a hos-
pital in Cleveland, a cosmopolitan city. Therefore, our findings likely reflect broad patterns of
diversity within large geographic regions. Within our sample, there are regional differences in
the proportions of European, African and Amerind ancestry and wider sampling might have
differentiated the picture further. Nevertheless, the distinct patterns of H. pylori ancestry in the
four countries indicate that recent population movements have been strongly influenced by
national boundaries.
H. pylori can undergo high levels of recombination during mixed infection. Over time, this
might lead to bacteria acquiring an ancestry profile that reflects their local gene pool rather
than their continent of origin. Recombination has not proceeded this far anywhere in the
Americas and multiple populations with distinct ancestry profiles are found in most locations.
hspAmerind strains have not contributed substantially to the ancestry of bacteria from any
other population, but do appear to have acquired hpEurope DNA themselves. In Nicaragua
and Colombia, recombination has transmitted distinctive DNA between populations, e.g. the
brown shaded component in the hspEuropeS isolates from Nicaragua (Fig 2B), leading to what
can informally be thought of as a national signature in the H. pylori DNA. There is no equiva-
lent signal of hspAfrica1NAmerica DNA amongst the hpEurope bacteria from the US, indicat-
ing that recombination between these populations has been less extensive, and there is also no
evidence within our sample of a distinctive population of hpEurope bacteria evolving within
the US. Similar patterns of higher admixture in African American and Hispanic American
individuals than in American individuals of European descent have been observed also on
human genomic level [19].

 The differences in the extent of admixture in the New World populations can have several
explanations including differences in dates of colonization and extent of European and African
influx/admixture in Latin America compared to the US. Another important factor can be the
prevalence of infection in different areas. The prevalence of H. pylori infection remains high in
Latin American countries, ranging from 70.1% to 84.7% of adults in a recent multi-country
study [20]. In the US, the prevalence has been declining from high levels and according to data
from the end of the 1990’s, is around 32.5% [21]. The prevalence was different between the eth-
nic groups: 52.7% in non-Hispanic blacks; 61.6% in Mexican Americans and; 26.2% in non-
Hispanic whites [21]. High prevalence likely entails higher occurrence of horizontal transmis-
sion and mixed infections and thus the possibility of recombination between distantly related
strains [22] [23].
Our sample of Old World sources is incomplete, both in Africa and Europe, and therefore
it is likely that Old World sub-populations exist that are more closely related to the New
World populations than those in our sample, one such area being the Iberian peninsula. Also,
even if we sample extensively in modern human groups, this may not fully reflect structure
500 years ago. The absence of sampling of close surrogates of the true ancestral subpopulations
may alter our conclusions about selection or drift, which we have interpreted to have taken
place in the New World rather than in the Old World. Sampling limitations for example make
it unclear how much of the extensive mixture between African and European DNA observed
in many Central and Southern American isolates actually took place in the Americas. Never-
theless, it is difficult to explain the local affinities within the diverse gene pools in both Nicara-
gua and Colombia, except by local genetic exchange. The hspAfrica1NAmerica isolates are
homogeneous in their ancestry profile, suggesting that they also form a distinct gene pool that
has acquired its characteristics through substantial evolution within the USA, although some
of this evolution may have happened in an as yet unsampled subpopulation in Africa.
hspAfrica1NAmerica appears to be an approximately panmictic population. For example,
all isolates have approximately the same level of hpEurope ancestry in Fig 1. This feature is dif-
ficult to reconcile with the low levels of genetic exchange observed with hpEurope isolates
from the US. Since it has been shown that H. pylori from the same population (hpEastAsia)
can exchange 10% of their genome during a single four year mixed infection in human [24],
the ancestral pattern in US H. pylori implies barriers to recombination between the two popu-
lations. Such barriers may be the result of ethnic segregation and thus less diverse co-infec-
tions, of differential uptake or incorporation of DNA from different populations, or of
efficient competitive exclusion of bacteria from one population by bacteria from the other
within individual stomachs.
In the New World populations, four genes encoding for outer membrane proteins have
sequence with ancestry that differed from that inferred for the overall core genome in more
than one of the New World population. Interestingly, several of these variants were common
for Latin American isolates regardless of which ancestral population they belonged to. AlpB is
an adhesin binding to laminins in the extracellular matrix [25] that is present in all H. pylori
strains [26]. Together with AlpA, it is required for colonization in experimental models and
for efficient adhesion to gastric epithelial cells [27]. The HofC protein is also required for H.
pylori colonization in mice and gerbils [28,29] but is not well characterized and little is known
about its function. FrpB4 is important in the bacterial adaptation to variation in the microenvi-
ronment. FrpB4 is regulated by the levels of nickel, a micronutrient essential for H. pylori sur-
vival, growth and expression of virulence factors in the human stomach [30–32].
The enrichment pattern in hofC in a high number of the South American isolates was
largely explained by the positions in region 276–309 of the 528 amino acid protein. The vari-
ants were found in all the South American Amerindian strains as well as almost all of the
Helicobacter pylori evolution in post-Columbian America

 hspAfrica1Nicaragua and a majority of hspEuropeColombia strains together with strains from
Peru and El Salvador. No Mexican strains were found in this clade. Since the HofC protein
structure and function are not characterised in detail, we are unfortunately unable to predict
how these alleles contribute to the function or specificity of the protein. Interestingly, also in
FrpB4 there were several positions of high Fst in Latin America compared to the rest of the
world (S4 Fig) but nor in this case we are able speculate in the functional impact of these spe-
cific positions. Nevertheless, the very pronounced enrichment pattern, as well as that in the
other genes, is consistent with the New World H. pylori having adapted to their respective
human populations, allowing certain traits to propagate relative to the overall genetic back-
ground. This could be important in understanding the differences in pathogenicity in different
areas and different host/bacterial interactions, suggesting a need for further investigation of
the function of these proteins.
Our analysis of the accessory genome shows that H. pylori gene content, as well as nucleo-
tide composition, is mixed during admixture between host populations. For example, the gene
content of hpEurope is intermediate between that of hpAfrica1 and hpAsia2, but with substan-
tial variation that may reflect the large time that has elapsed since admixture. hspEuropeCo-
lombia is more African in genome content than the average hpEurope bacteria from Europe,
as would be expected because of its higher African ancestry at the nucleotide level. However,
the genome content of strains from the hspAfrica1Nicaragua population is more African than
would be expected given its substantial co-ancestry with hpEurope within the core genome.
This observation is concordant with recent observations showing that restriction modification
inhibits non homologous but not homologous recombination [33], suggesting that core
genome ancestry may mix more readily between populations than accessory elements if
restriction modification is an important barrier to exchange.
Our results on the population structure in the Americas sheds new light on the relationship
between human migration and H. pylori diversity. In particular, we show that at least during
human population upheavals, evolution within geographic locations is far more dynamic than
the broad correlation with human genetic variation would suggest and that novel subpopula-
tions can arise by a combination of genetic drift and admixture within hundreds of years.
Materials and methods
Helicobacter pylori whole genome sequencing data
We used both publicly available and newly sequenced genomes of H. pylori isolates, 401 in
total (S1 Table). Nicaraguan isolates were collected at Hospital Escuela Antonio Lenin Fonseca
(HEALF) in Managua, within the international collaboration “Immunological Biomarkers in
Gastric Cancer development” and previously described in [34]. Colombian isolates that are
not previously described were collected at the Oncology hospital (INCAN) in Bogota, and the
Mexican isolates were collected at the Oncology and General Hospital in Mexico City. All
three hospitals are tertiary referral centres for endoscopy and patients may thus come from
other locations within the countries. For the cases we had more detailed data on the origin of
the individuals, this is noted in S1 Table.
The publicly available Colombian and North American genomes were those reported in
preceding studies, i.e [35–37].
Data preparation
All of the genome sequences were imported into the Bacterial Isolate Genome sequence data-
base (BIGSdb) [38]. After this, a gene-by-gene alignment was performed using CDS sequences
of the H. pylori 26695 strains as reference, and the alignments were exported from the
Helicobacter pylori evolution in post-Columbian America

 database. Both the genome sequences and the alignment are available at the public data reposi-
tory Dryad (http://datadryad.org/), with doi doi:10.5061/dryad.8qp4n. We conducted SNP
calling for each alignment, and imputation for polymorphic sites with missing frequency
< 1% using BEAGLE [39] as our preceding study [40]. We combined in total 401350 SNPs in
1232 genes while preserving information of SNP positions in the reference genome, to prepare
genome-wide haplotype data.
Population structure analysis
We inferred population structure among the strains from the genome-wide haplotype data by
using the chromosome painting and fineSTRUCTURE [9], according to a procedure of our
preceding study that applied them to H. pylori genomes [10]. Briefly, we used ChromoPainter
(version 0.04) to infer chunks of DNA donated from a donor to a recipient for each recipient
haplotype, and summarized the results into a “co-ancestry matrix” which contains the number
of recombination-derived chunks from each donor to each recipient individual. We then ran
fineSTRUCTURE (version 0.02) for 100,000 iterations of both the burn-in and Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) chain in order to conduct clustering of individuals based on the co-
ancestry matrix.
Principal Component Analysis was performed by applying the standard PCA implemented
in Eigensoft to our data (more precisely, all biallelic data after pruning of SNPs with r2 > 0.7).
D-statistics were calculated by using popstats (https://github.com/pontussk/popstats) and
specifying POP1 as hpAfrica2, POP2 as hspAfrica1WAfrica, POP3 as hpAsia2, and POP4 as
either of the remaining 9 populations, respectively.
Stratified chromosome painting
We conducted two types of chromosome painting; “Old World chromosome painting” using
only Old world isolates as donors, and “Global chromosome painting” in which each isolate is
painted using all of the others. For this purpose, we used ChromoPainterV2 software [9].
To identify genomic regions with enrichment of unexpected ancestry components in the
New World populations hspAfrica1NAmerica, hspAfrica1Nicaragua, and hspEuropeColom-
bia, we conducted a novel statistical test for each of the 401350 SNPs. This was done using the
Old world strains as donors, grouped into African, Asian and European geographic origin
respectively.
We aim to count the number of recipient haplotypes from a certain donor population at
each SNP. However, we do not observe whether a recipient i uses a particular donor popula-
tion a, but instead the probability that it does at each locus l. The distribution of the total num-
ber of isolates at locus l from donor population a is ~ Poisson-Binomial(plia). If we let the
genome-wide painting probability be pia ¼ ðPL
l¼1pliaÞ=L, then the distribution expected under
the null that there is no local structure to the painting donors is ~ Poisson-Binomial(pia). We
therefore report the p-values to test whether locus i has significantly enriched for donor a (and
likewise to test for de-enrichment). We used P<10−8 as a significance level, which corresponds
to P<0.05 after Bonferroni correction.
Because a) the variance of a Poisson-Binomial is highest when is close to 0.5, and b) the
distribution is discrete, this statistic has less power to detect high ancestry contributions
from components that have high genome-wide ancestry, especially when sample size is
small. In practice this has limited our power to detect regions that have an excess of Afri-
can ancestry.

 Phylogenetic analysis of genes with enriched ancestry
Multiple alignments of the genes were performed using MUSCLE [41] and the alignment
manually inspected to remove sequences with incomplete coverage before a PhyML maximum
likelihood tree was created using the SeaView software [42]. All trees were visualized using
Evolview [43].
Fixation index (Fst) analysis
Fixation index (Fst) analysis was performed using the R package PopGenome [44]. For all the
1232 core-genome multiple alignments were converted to VCF format using SNP-sites [45]
and site-wise Fst was calculated over all biallelic sites for the subpopulation consisting of all
isolates that were geographically originating from Latin America. In total 164 358 positions in
933 of the genes were eligible for the analysis. Of those 187 positions had an Fst of more than
0.25 in the Latin American isolates compared to strains from the rest of the World (S2 Table).
WebLogo plots were generated using [46].
Analysis of gene presence/absence and accessory genome
A pan-genome was constructed with all loci present in at least one of our 401 strains to exam-
ine presence/absence of all H. pylori genes. This pan-genome list of 2462 genes was used as
queries of BLASTN against each genome analysed in this study through the BIGSdb Genome
Comparator pipeline [38]. Gene presence was judged by a BLASTN match of �70% identity
over �50% of the locus length [47].
Accessory presence/absence tree
The Genome Comparator Output matrix obtained with BIGSdb was used to build a distance
matrix (MATLAB R2015a, The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Massachusetts, United States). A
tree was obtained using SplitsTree4 [48] and was visualised with Evolview [43].
