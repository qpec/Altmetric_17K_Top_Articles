Adverse drug reactions and interactions are among the major causes of death in the United States.
Antidepressants have been reported as causing suicide and homicide and share the class attribute of
frequently producing akathisia, a state of severe restlessness associated with thoughts of death and
violence. Medical examiners can now identify some pharmacogenetic interactions that cause drugs,
deemed safe for most, to be lethal to others. Such deaths do not yet include medication-induced, aka-
thisia-related suicides and homicides. An extrapyramidal side effect, akathisia is a manifestation of drug
toxicity whose causes lie, inter alia, in drugs, doses, and co-prescribed medications that inhibit and
compete for metabolizing enzymes, which may themselves be defective. In this paper, we report our
investigation into adverse drug reactions/interactions in three persons who committed homicide, two
also intending suicide, while on antidepressants prescribed for stressful life events. Their histories of
medication use, adverse reactions and reasons for changes in medications are presented. DNA samples
were screened for variants in the cytochrome P450 gene family; that produce drug metabolizing en-
zymes. All three cases exhibit genotype-based diminished metabolic capability that, in combination with
their enzyme inhibiting/competing medications, decreased metabolism further and are the likely cause
of these catastrophic events.

1. Introduction
Many drugs that cross the bloodebrain barrier and a quarter of
the medicines in general use are metabolized by the highly poly-
morphic cytochrome P450 system.1 Blood levels of prescribed
medicines can be pushed towards toxicity because of genetically
determined metabolizing capacity, high doses, and interactions
with co-prescribed CYP450 inhibitors and synergies. Genetics of
the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) system are the otherwise invisible
factor that can correlate with catastrophic behavioural distur-
bances. A forensic investigation combined with medication history,
reports from observers, clinical records and a blood sample or a
non-invasive swab from the living or dead can help elucidate the
proximate, pharmacogenetic cause of death, suicide or violence.
This determination can absolve persons charged with homicide (or
abort the investigation), affect insurance pay-outs for suicide,
provide an absolute defence of involuntary intoxication for the
perpetrator of violence, and should protect a living person from
getting more drugs with the same metabolic pathways as those
that caused the problem.
1.1. Medication-induced akathisia violence, suicide and homicide
That antidepressants cause some people to commit suicide has
been known since the advent of the tricyclic antidepressants in the
late 1950s.2 In the early 1980s, Shear, then Schulte described cases
of violence, homicide and suicide associated with akathisia (from
the Greek for “can't sit down”), in some people taking antipsychotic
medications.3e5 Since the late 1980s, “new generation” antide-
pressants have been prescribed for stressful life situations, but their
adverse effects and clinical trial data and have not been fully dis-
closed.6 Akathisia is a dangerous adverse effect of antidepressants,
antipsychotics and some other drugs that cross the bloodebrain
barrier. Unlike delusion-driven homicide and depression-driven
suicide, akathisia-related violence and suicidality can abate when

 medication is decreased, changed or slowly stopped. Suicidality and
violence tend to get worse if the dose is not tapered slowly. In 1990,
Teicher reported on cases of new and persistent suicidality on
fluoxetine, the first of a series of serotonin-boosting antidepres-
sants, marketed as “new generation antidepressants” SSRIs and
SNRIs.7 These new drugs carry a relative risk of suicide and aka-
thisia violence several times that of older tri- or tetracyclic anti-
depressants, known as TCAs.8 In 2003, Healy accessed company
archives on court orders, inspected the clinical trials presented for
their licensing, as well as epidemiological and follow-up studies, all
containing
evidence
of
SSRI-induced
suicide.9
This
research
contributed to the document: United States Food and Drug Admin-
istration (FDA) Public Health Advisory: Worsening Depression and
Suicidality in Patients Being Treated With Antidepressant (March 22,
2004).10 This text was mandated into product information for all
antidepressants and further warned health care providers and care
givers to monitor daily for anxiety, agitation, panic attacks,
insomnia, irritability, hostility, impulsivity, akathisia (severe rest-
lessness), hypomania, and mania in persons treated for psychiatric
and non-psychiatric conditions with antidepressants.10 Fergusson
et al. found suicide rates were double to treble those on placebo in
183 antidepressant trials.11 After reviewing 373 antidepressant
clinical trials on information provided by the drug companies, FDA
conceded that they did cause suicide. In that review, the FDA relied
on the drug companies' own information and persisted with the
systemic error that, before Healy's review of early trials, they had
obliterated the suicide effect. That is to say, FDA reviewers
continued to code suicides that occurred in the run in-washout
period and in withdrawal as “placebo suicides”. In 2006, Stone
et al. found that more suicides had occurred in some of these trials
and had not been reported at all, and that half of them had been
incorrectly coded as occurring on placebo.12 In 2007, a Black Box
suicide warning about increased suicidality (the highest form of
alert) was extended to persons up to the age of 24.13 Hostility is
called “aggression” and “homicidal ideation” in some labels.
“Emotional lability” is used when a subject is withdrawn from a
trial because of suicidal ideation.
RxISK.org manages a website documenting over 6000 press
reports of massacres, homicides, suicides, school and college
shootings which date back to 1966, involving both old and new
antidepressants and stimulants prescribed for attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder. Some legal defences are described.14 Recent
finding show a significant association between SSRIs and violent
crime for individuals 15e24 years old.15 Acute neuroleptic- (and
SRI-) induced akathisia (code 333.99) appeared in 1994 in the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders of the
American Psychiatric Association (DSM IV) along with its fluctu-
ating associated features: restlessness, suicide attempts, aggres-
sion, symptoms of toxic psychosis and behavioural dyscontrol.16
DSM-5 (2013) has acknowledged acute and tardive medication-
induced akathisia, but the constellation of catastrophic associated
features no longer appears, nor does withdrawal akathisia nor
delayed post-withdrawal akathisia, all of which are often mis-
interpreted as the return of an illness.17 Restlessness, aggression in
thought and deed, suicidality, death wish, behavioural dyscontrol,
confusion, delirium, cognitive
impairment, changing variable
moods and presentations can be manifestations of neurotoxicity.
Documents obtained in 1986 in a product liability suit against Eli
Lilly revealed that the FDA had repeatedly warned that fluoxetine
has a stimulant profile similar to amphetamines.18 In 1998, from
Pfizer's laboratories, Roger Lane confirmed that antidepressant
manufacturers were aware that SSRI-induced akathisia and suicide
cases were related, inter alia, to cytochrome P450 metabolizer
status, as well as drugedrug interactions, slowing metabolism and
prolonging half-life.19 In 2003, Breggin reported patients taking
SSRIs who deteriorated into mania, agitated depression and
violence.20 Before the FDA's concession, general causation of sui-
cide and homicide by antidepressants had been established in a
series of Daubert Hearings in American courts.21 Expert evidence
was compliant with Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.
Healy suggested it was automatism: “… a transient, non-recurrent
mental malfunction caused by an external factor, whether physical
or psychological, that the mind of an ordinary person would be
unlikely to have withstood and that produces an incapacity to
control his or her acts”. Automatism refers to behaviour consequent
on chemical lobotomy disrupting the connection between the
frontal lobe and motor behaviour.
Moore et al. studied 1527 cases of violence reported for 31
drugs. They concluded, “Acts of violence towards others were a
genuine and serious adverse drug event associated with a relatively
small group of drugs”.22 Varenicline, a drug for smoking cessation,
was followed by antidepressants, with fluoxetine and paroxetine
having the highest ranking. Violence associated with venlafaxine
and desvenlafaxine, a drug and its first metabolite, make that pair
the most implicated in violence, which can manifest as suicide and/
or on others, as homicide. This confirmed the finding of Barbui
et al.23 In the drugs companies' own trials presented for their
licensing, “new generation” or “atypical” antipsychotics were found
to carry double the risk of suicide on antidepressants.24
1.2. Drug metabolizing enzymes of the cytochrome P450 family
The cytochrome P450 family of enzymes metabolizes up to 80
per cent of xenobiotics and most drugs used in psychiatry.25
Medicines interact with the cytochrome P450 system as sub-
strates, inducers, inhibitors or any combination of the three.26
Metabolism is affected by extrinsic factors, doses, and co-
prescribed medications as well as intrinsic factors: nutrition, age,
iron status, liver health, gender and comorbidity.27
The population can be broadly divided by DNA testing into
extensive, those being normal or “wild-type,” intermediate, and
poor metabolizers for five major genes involved in drug meta-
bolism: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. There is
an additional category of ultra-rapid metabolizers (UM) for
CYP1A2, for CYP2C19 due to the *17 allele, and for CYP2D6 due to
gene duplication of alleles that code for extensive metabolizing.
DNA testing can be done from blood or buccal swab. Changes in the
sequence of amino acids in the genes result in variant alleles that
produce drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) that differ in meta-
bolic ability.
Poor metabolizers (PMs) tend to have adverse drug reactions
quickly, but intermediate metabolizers (IMs) in whom there is a
slower and unrecognized build-up of a drug or its metabolites are
also at risk. Ultra-rapid metabolizers (UMs) at CYP2D6 have been
found to be at increased risk of death by suicide and intoxication,
particularly if taking prodrugs, opioids, which need CYP2D6 to
convert them into the effective analgesic, morphine.28 With ultra-
rapid metabolizers, blood levels of some antidepressants with
short half-lives may fluctuate over a single day with intolerable
effects and may never reach therapeutic levels. Fast metabolism
poses a greater risk on withdrawal. Fast-changing levels of psy-
chotropic substances, up or down, can cause behavioural changes,
as the neurotransmitters in the brain react to reach some equilib-
rium. This phenomenon makes starting and stopping medication
the most dangerous times for suicide and violence, but both can
happen at any time, with stress, provocation, dose change, addition
or subtraction of a medication. These toxic responses to antide-
pressants may occur early or later in treatment.
Forensic pharmacogenomics correlates genetic variations to
response to drugs.29 DNA testing can provide forensic examiners

 with a tool to investigate death caused by medication.30 In 2000,
forensic pharmacogenetics was first used to explain the death of a
nine-year-old child treated with a combination of methylpheni-
date, codeine and fluoxetine where the medical examiner reported
fluoxetine toxicity. Finding that the child was defective in CYP2D6
capability aborted a homicide investigation of the parents by
explaining the toxic level.31 Lucire and Crotty reported ten akathisia
homicides (and some attempts) committed by people taking anti-
depressants, not for mental illness, but for distress caused by their
predicaments. These individuals also had diminishing mutations in
the CYP450 family of metabolizing enzymes and all were taking
medicines that further decreased metabolism by inhibition.32
DNA testing can be used to predict and avoid adverse drug re-
actions. The forensic perspective involves working backwards from
the event, explaining the adverse drug reaction by reference to the
subject's genotype and the effects of co-prescribed medications. In
this paper, we have documented the clinical history, medication
regime and genotypes of three persons who committed homicide.
We
propose
that
the
three
case
studies
are
instances
of
antidepressant-induced, akathisia-related homicide where dimin-
ishing mutations in CYP450-encoding genes contributed to toxicity,
along with high doses, substantial drug burden, drugedrug in-
teractions, drugegene and drugegeneedrug interactions, inhaler
and alcohol use.
2. Materials and methods
The subjects were interviewed and medical files were studied to
ascertain if mental illness was evident before medication was given
and to establish reasons for prescribing or changing medications.
Reports of events were evaluated and medication in use was
correlated with what the subjects were thinking and feeling before
and during the homicides.
Genetic testing was performed for CYP450 genes that metabo-
lize the drugs in use: CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and, when avail-
able, for CYP1A2, CYP3A4 and CYP2B6. DNA sampling was done by
buccal swap. DNA isolation was performed by Independent
Forensic Services in Hulshorst, The Netherlands, using the QIAamp
Investigator Kit (Qiagen). Cytochrome P450 genotyping was per-
formed by the Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The
Netherlands. For CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/
A5 by using the TaqMan® Drug Metabolism Genotyping Assays
(ThermoFisher Scientific) and PCR-RFLP. Genotyping of CYP2D6
was performed using the AmpliChip Test (Roche Molecular Di-
agnostics), which is specific for CYP2D6 variants.
Information on CYP450 alleles, drugegene, and drugedrug in-
teractions was obtained from online databases: The Human Cyto-

3. Subject 1, USA
A 39-year-old woman, with no prior history of mental illness,
suicidality or violence had a difficult marriage and was prescribed
zolpidem 10 mg/night for insomnia and alprazolam for fear of
flying. A year later, she had divorced, moved to a new house, a
parent had died, and she felt overwhelmed. Sertraline, 50 mg/day,
was superimposed on long-term zolpidem use. Her mental state
deteriorated. She said she had no emotions and felt like a “zombie”.
She was switched to venlafaxine 150 mg/day. Throughout her
treatment, she had been restless and had slept only with zolpidem,
waking after few hours in an agitated state. At some point, she
began believing that killing her husband and herself was the right
thing to do for her children. She stopped venlafaxine abruptly and,
on the following day, she ambushed her husband with a baseball
bat, then stabbed him many times. Intent on committing suicide,
she overdosed on zolpidem, alprazolam and alcohol, but survived
and was charged with murder. The metabolic pathways of the
drugs in use are presented in Table 1. Her P450 genotypes for the
relevant enzymes are presented in Table 2.
3.1. Discussion
Her genotypes, CYP2D6*5/*41, CYP2C9*1/*1 CYP2C19*2/*17 and
CYP3A4*1/*22, characterize her as a very poor metabolizer with
diminished capacity involving four out of eight alleles tested across
four genes (Table 2). The effect of long-term zolpidem would be to
further inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP2C9, which would likely
have increased her blood levels of zolpidem, a drug associated with
homicidal behaviour, both on its own and in conjunction with
SSRIs.36 The addition of sertraline to zolpidem, i.e., adding a sub-
strate to an inhibitor (pattern 2 described by Armstrong et al.),
would likely have provoked an adverse drug reaction, psychic
numbing and worsening depression.37 She would have had very
little metabolizing capacity left for zolpidem and venlafaxine. Both
have similar, synergistic neurotoxic effects, and this may be as
significant clinically as the interaction. Venlafaxine is primarily
metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, and its psychoactive metab-
olite, desvenlafaxine, is a substrate of CYP3A4. Some databases
suggest that CYP2C19 or CYP2D6 may play a part in metabolizing
desvenlafaxine, but this information remains uncertain.
In this person, the activity of CYP2D6, a high-affinity but low-
capacity enzyme, would have been greatly reduced, compromised
by a diminished activity allele, *41, and a gene deletion, *5. CYP3A4
was also genetically compromised. Its enzymatic activity would
have been further diminished due to inhibition by long-term ser-
traline use and substrate competition (between desvenlafaxine,
sertraline, and zolpidem). The reduction of metabolic capacity for
venlafaxine would be expected to prolong its half-life, likely taking
the level over the therapeutic window and into a level that was
toxic for that person (with possible input from variants in the ge-
netics of transporters and receptors for which testing is not yet
commercially available). While CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 are said to
play a minor role in the metabolism of sertraline and zolpidem, all
enzymes can be promiscuous and facilitate metabolism, albeit less
effectively, under these conditions.38 Substrate competition for
enzymes by all three drugs made further demands on limited
enzymatic capacity: CYP2C9 being inhibited by both zolpidem and
sertraline and CYP2C19 being inhibited by sertraline. Increasing
toxicity could have resulted in delirium, making her simultaneously
euphoric and homicidal. Possibly experiencing drug toxicity, she
stopped venlafaxine without tapering, and the rapid fall in blood
level coincided with her behaviour. A similar case has been
described, involving imaginary altruism that caused a loving father

 in a paroxetine-induced state of euphoria combined with homicidal
ideation to kill his child.32
Based on the pharmacogenetic analysis, we hypothesize that
poor drug metabolism and drugegeneedrug interactions caused a
CYP450-based adverse drug reaction resulting in a medication-
induced homicide. Inhibition of its own metabolism by zolpidem
and, by the same means, the inhibition of the metabolism of anti-
depressants, may explain why it its product information advises
that zolpidem should not be used for more than three weeks and
why it should not be combined with an SSRI. Adverse effects of
venlafaxine include abnormal thinking, abnormal/changed behav-
iour, aggressive reaction, akathisia, amnesia, apathy, confusion,
delusions,
dementia,
depersonalization,
emotional
lability,
euphoria, hallucinations, hostility, homicidal ideation, illusion,
impulse control difficulties, manic reaction, paranoid reaction,
psychosis, depression and illusion, suicidal ideation and attempt,
psychotic and worsening depression.39 Adverse effects listed for

tion, delusion, dementia, depersonalization, dysphasia, feeing

Subject 1 took a plea bargain for second-degree murder and
received a lengthy prison sentence. The pharmacogenetic evidence
was brought up during the sentence appeal. A drug-screen for
venlafaxine had been performed, but five days after her last dose.
The coroner's laboratory, apparently unaware that drugs are not
detectable after five half-lives, reported that the absence of ven-
lafaxine in her blood meant that she had never used it.
4. Subject 2, Holland
A
33-year
old
woman
with
marriage
problems
became
depressed and preoccupied with death, but had no delusions or
hallucinations. She was hospitalized and treated for anxiety and
depression with sertraline and temazepam, and then quetiapine
was added for persistent insomnia. On this combination, she
experienced severe fatigue, experienced weird thoughts that she
recognized as such, remained gloomy, and failed to recover. She
improved when her husband was hospitalized with a psychiatric
breakdown but deteriorated again when he came home. She re-
ported mood swings and panic attacks. Her doctor thought she was
delusional. A year later, she was hospitalized and switched to
venlafaxine 150 mg/day, which is 2e4 times the recommended
starting dose. A couple of months later, the note, “this patient does
not belong in psychiatric care,” was recorded, and she was dis-
charged. Venlafaxine was reduced to 75 mg/day, and temazepam
and quetiapine were ceased. After nine months, she stopped ven-
lafaxine without tapering but, two weeks later, she resumed her
prescribed dosage. Her behaviour was described as “erratic” and
“chaotic”. Without warning, she suffocated her two-year-old son
with a pillow, hanged him using the cord of her bathrobe, put him
in a box, woke her 7-year-old-daughter and told her that they all,
including herself, had to die. She drove a car, along with her
daughter, into a canal. Her daughter escaped. Charged with murder
and attempted murder, she had only patchy recall of these events.
Drugs and enzymes for this subject are given in Table 3. A year later,
the defence team requested genetic testing for CYP450 (Table 4).
4.1. Discussion
Her genotypes, CYP2D6*2/*2 and CYP2C19*1/*1 were normal, but
CYP2C9*1/*3 and CYP3A4*3/*22 are those of an intermediate
metabolizer for both CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 (Table 4). Her toxic
problems started with the first prescription of serotonergic anti-
depressants, sertraline, temazepam, and then quetiapine (a drug
marketed as an antidepressant/antimanic/antipsychotic and also as
a sleeping pill while subject to the FDA antidepressant advisories)
for situational depression. She failed to recover, and her doctor
thought she was delusional, but the criterion of a delusion, a fixed
belief impervious to reason, was not met. Again, all three drugs
interacted, and their listed side effects include abnormal thinking,
aggression, akathisia, amnesia, confusion, delirium, delusions,
depression, emotional lability, euphoria, hallucinations, manic re-
action, paranoid reaction, paroniria, psychosis, suicidal ideation,
attempts and suicide. Over time, sertraline most likely inhibited
and depleted her diminished CYP2C9, and sertraline and quetiapine
inhibited and depleted CYP2D6, leaving her with little or no
enzyme capacity to metabolize her medicines. She developed
Adverse Effects of Medication NOS (DSM IV TR and DSM-5 995.2)
necessitating hospitalization and medication change. Venlafaxine
was introduced, adding a drug that is both substrate and inhibitor
of CYP2D6.
Further inhibition of CYP2D6 by venlafaxine over time would be
expected to elevate its blood levels, resulting in her decision to
cease taking it. Sudden withdrawal caused problems, and this may
be the reason she restarted it. CYP2D6 is a low-capacity enzyme,
which can be overwhelmed, converting even an extensive metab-
olizer into a poor metabolizer. CYP3A4, on the other hand, is a high-
capacity,
low-affinity
enzyme,
notoriously
promiscuous

 unpredictable, and it picks up metabolism when other enzymes are
not available.41 As with Subject 1, venlafaxine, by inhibiting
CYP2D6, inhibited its own metabolism. CYP3A4 was genetically
compromised as well as inhibited. Her metabolic capability was
reduced. A toxicology screen performed on the day of the homicide
showed a toxic range in the blood with a total 2.29 mg/L, combining
venlafaxine: 0.59 mg/L and desvenlafaxine: 1.7 mg/L. The agreed
therapeutic range at that laboratory for the two drugs combined is
between 0.2 and 0.75 mg/L, with toxic effects starting at 1.0 mg/L.
The phenomenon of dose-dependent inhibition of CYP2D6
increasing with blood levels over time applies to other antide-
pressants. With daily doses, blood levels may rise. By introducing
inhibition of enzymes as well as competition for them, poly-
pharmacy increases the risk of catastrophic side effects.42 After
Andrea Yates drowned her six children in a bathtub while taking
venlafaxine, mirtazapine and several other substances, Wyeth,
while denying causation, then added homicidal ideation to the list
of adverse effects.43
Substance-induced homicidal ideation is biological and invol-
untary as are somatic adverse reactions. When homicidal thinking
is associated with mood elevation, euphoria, it becomes homicidal
mania. Involuntary, out-of-character, and uncontrollable violent
thoughts should not be taken as evidence of planning. Akathisia is
sometimes masked by akinesia, fatigue that “ropes you to the bed”.
Patients stop taking medicines if they experience their effects as
intolerable, and unknowingly risk withdrawal effects, which are
often more severe. The post-withdrawal period is as dangerous as
the initial period for suicide and homicide.44 The combination of
medication, fluctuating restlessness, suicidality, aggression and
toxic hallucinosis are pathognomonic of akathisia. We cannot find
any other diagnosis in any medical taxonomy that combines sui-
cidal and aggressive thoughts and behaviours with medication, nor
any other that recedes when the culprit medication has been
stopped slowly.
5. Subject 3, Holland
A 42-year-old man, with no history of mental illness, suicidality
or violence, discovered that his wife was unfaithful, but they stayed
together. He was prescribed paroxetine 20 mg/day for his distress.
He took it sporadically, when he felt that he needed something for
his nerves. Some months later, after drinking alcohol and taking
20 mg of paroxetine, he tried to strangle his wife with the sash of
her bathrobe. She hit him, and he stopped the attack, but he did not
remember what he had done. His doctor failed to recognize this as
an akathisia event, and added oxazepam 30 mg/day to be taken in
divided doses. Subject 3 gave this medication to a person who also
had marital problems, saying he would take an “extra paroxetine
tablet” if he felt depressed. Two weeks later, he drank a dozen
glasses of beer in a bar, took 40 mg of paroxetine and used his
asthma inhaler containing budesonide/formoterol. How long he
had used that inhaler and how many doses he used is not known.
According to witnesses, he was neither drunk nor aggressive when
he left. On the way home, he saw the car of his now-estranged wife
in front of the house of his rival, and he called her on his cell phone.
When she refused to talk to him, according to his statement, his
“lights went out”. He went home, picked up an antique revolver and
a hammer and returned to the house of his rival. He reported that
he could see them inside on the couch. He then smashed the
window with the hammer and climbed through it, cutting himself
and leaving blood. He said that he “felt nothing” and was “like a
robot”. He shot his wife and rival, who both survived. He then drove
to the house of the rival's wife, whom he blamed for coming be-
tween himself and his own wife. He forced entry into her house and
shot her fatally. He reported feeling both hot and cold and shaking
violently. He drove for some hours before turning himself in to the
authorities. No toxicology screen was performed. He was charged
with murder and two attempted murders, convicted and sentenced
to 24 years in jail.
On appeal, his lawyer raised the defence that paroxetine had
caused this behaviour. Toxicology conducted on dried bloodstains
detected paroxetine above the threshold of 10 ng/mL (blood), but
the exact level could not be determined. The metabolic pathways of
the drugs in use are presented in Table 5. During the appeal, DNA
testing for P450 genotypes was performed (Table 6).
5.1. Discussion
His genotypes, CYP2D6*2/*9, CYP2B6*1/*6, CYP2C9*1/*1 CYP2-
C19*6/*17 and CYP3A4*1/*1, characterize him as an intermediate
metabolizer (IM) with diminished capacity involving three out of
ten alleles tested across five genes. Paroxetine is a potent inhibitor
of CYP2D6, and over time, converts 80 per cent of extensive
metabolizers into poor metabolizers.45 CYP2D6 was genetically
compromised, by the diminished activity allele, *9. Paroxetine also
inhibits CYP1A2, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. Possible competition be-
tween paroxetine and formoterol in his inhaler may slow the rate at
which either is metabolized. According to Jornil et al., CYP2D6 (high
affinity) and CYP3A4 (low affinity) are most likely the major con-
tributors to paroxetine metabolism. CYP1A2 could an important
factor, whereas the importance of CYP2C19 is probably limited.46
Alcohol inhibits CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and, given the alcohol
content of 12 beers, also CYP3A4. Alcohol is a substrate for CYP1A2.
The competition between paroxetine, alcohol and budesonide for
CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 may have increased toxicity. He was exten-

 psychiatric illness, aggression or impulsivity was found.47 Alcohol,
on its own, had not caused violent behaviour in this individual
before. In 2014, Menkes and Herxheimer reported on a syndrome of
pathological intoxication by alcohol in patients being treated with
SSRI antidepressants.48 The hot and cold sensations and restless
driving all suggest acute serotonin toxicity and associated akathisia.
6. Overall discussion
Three persons committed homicide, two of which intended to
commit suicide. None had been aggressive or mentally ill before
getting medication. None had known that they needed to take
medication regularly or how to stop taking it safely. None improved
on medication, and no prescriber recognized their complaints as
adverse drug reactions or was aware of impending danger. In-
terviews elicited accounts of restlessness, akathisia, confusion,
delirium, euphoria, extreme anxiety, obsessive preoccupation with
aggression, and incomplete recall of events. Weird impulses to kill
were acted on without warning. On recovery, all recognized their
actions to be out of character, and their beliefs and behaviours
horrified them.
All were prescribed interacting medications, and one combined
these with alcohol. The drugedrug interactions further decreased
their metabolizing capacity, increasing risk for adverse drug re-
actions by prolonging half-life and raising levels. This paper eluci-
dates the necessary elements of an inquiry after a suicide attempt, a
homicide, or a violent crime. DNA testing can provide evidence for
legal proceedings. Cytochrome P450 genotyping can assist in the
interpretation of toxicology.49 The promise of Personalized Medi-
cine is that determination of a person's metabolizing capacity
before drug treatment or after an adverse event will avoid cata-
strophic events in the future. Pharmacogenetics paves the way for
personalized justice50e52
7. Summary
A forensic investigation of the serious problem of akathisia-
related violence requires several elements: first, blood needs to
be taken for a toxicology screen as soon as possible after the event.
Blood left at the crime scene may confirm medication use and
sometimes drug levels, but blood taken late does not exclude
toxicity at the relevant time. Second, pharmacogenetic testing
should be performed for (at least) CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9,
CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. The investigator needs to access
reliable information: the metabolic pathways of drugs in use, their
interactions with genes and with each other. No one stores this
knowledge about 2000 drugs, so it is accessed through charts and
medical informatics programs. Familiarity with symptoms, signs
and behaviours associated with neuroleptic toxicity is needed to
focus the history of experience and behaviour, which can be taken
from a perpetrator, a family member, or an observer, and can be
assisted by clinical records. Establishing the behavioural aspects of
akathisia, the fluctuating restlessness, the behavioural toxicity prior
to the event supports that diagnosis. This restlessness is associated
with thoughts of death, dying, and killing, and such thoughts can be
acted on without warning. Dysphoria, emotional distress that
cannot easily be articulated, ranges in intensity from mild
discomfort to one of the most painful mental states known to
psychiatry, often described as torture e so bad that death is seen as
a welcome relief. An out-of-character unmotivated homicide or
suicide by a person taking medication might be chemically induced
and involuntary. The capacity to use frontal lobe functions and
control behaviour can be impaired by brain toxicity. A “chemical
lobotomy” could be the outcome.
CYP450 status is an important factor that differentiates those
who can tolerate a drug or combination of drugs from those who
might not. Testing for cytochrome P450 identifies those at risk for
such adverse drug reactions. As forensic medical and toxicology
professionals become aware of the biological causes of these
catastrophic side effects, they may bring justice to both perpe-
trators and to victims of akathisia-related violence. The medical-
ization of common human distress has resulted in a very large
population getting medication that may do more harm than good
by causing suicides, homicides and the mental states that lead up
to them.53
