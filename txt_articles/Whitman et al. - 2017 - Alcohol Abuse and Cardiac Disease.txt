Abstract
Background—Understanding the relationship between alcohol abuse, a common and 
theoretically modifiable condition, and the most common cause of death in the world, 
cardiovascular disease, may inform potential prevention strategies.
Objective—To investigate the associations between alcohol abuse and atrial fibrillation (AF), 
myocardial infarction (MI), and congestive heart failure (CHF).
Methods—Using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project database, we performed a 
longitudinal analysis of California residents ≥21 years old who received ambulatory surgery, 
emergency, or inpatient medical care in California between 2005 and 2009. We determined the risk 
of an alcohol abuse diagnosis on incident AF, MI, and CHF. Patient characteristics modifying the 
associations and population attributable risks were determined.
Results—Among 14,727,591 patients, 268,084 (1.8%) had alcohol abuse. After multivariable 
adjustment, alcohol abuse was associated with an increased risk of incident AF (HR 2.14, 95% CI 
2.08–2.19, P<0.0001), MI (HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.40–1.51, P <0.0001), and CHF (HR 2.34, 95% CI 
2.29–2.39, P<0.0001). In interaction analyses, individuals without conventional risk factors for 
cardiovascular disease exhibited a disproportionately enhanced risk of each outcome. The 
population attributable risk of alcohol abuse on each outcome was of similar magnitude to other 
well-recognized modifiable risk factors.
Conclusions—Alcohol abuse increased the risk of AF, MI, and CHF to a similar degree as other 
well-established risk factors. Those without traditional cardiovascular risk factors are

mitigate alcohol abuse might result in meaningful reductions of cardiovascular disease.

Atrial fibrillation; myocardial infarction; congestive heart failure; alcohol abuse; epidemiology
Despite advances in prevention and treatments, cardiovascular disease continues to be the 
most prevalent threat to health and survival in the United States, comprising >25% of all 
deaths (1,2). More than 500,000 Americans suffered a first-time myocardial infarction (MI) 
in 2015, there are >870,000 new congestive heart failure (CHF) diagnoses annually, and 
atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common cardiac arrhythmia in the United States, affects >6 
million Americans and imposes a high risk of embolic stroke (3). Furthermore, with an 
aging population and enhanced detection techniques, prevalent MI and incident CHF and AF 
are on the rise, with a combined projected annual financial burden approaching $400 billion 
by 2030 (3–5). As such, defining and understanding modifiable risk factors for 
cardiovascular disease is of particular importance, and targeting modifiable risk factors 
common to AF, MI, and CHF could have a particularly broad impact.
Alcohol is the most commonly consumed drug in the United States (6). Several studies 
suggest that moderate levels of alcohol consumption may help prevent incident MI and CHF 
(7–15). Conversely, even low to moderate levels of alcohol consumption have been shown to 
increase the incidence of AF (16–18). Nonetheless, the lay press often highlights the 
potential health benefits of alcohol consumption (19,20), and the research that promulgates 
that it is heart healthy to drink more alcohol (21).
Alcohol abuse is present in 10–15 million Americans (6). While particular harms of alcohol 
abuse are appropriately frequently highlighted, including increased risk of domestic 
violence, suicide, accidents, cirrhosis, and some cancers (22), to some extent the 
cardiovascular literature may justify the moderate consumption of alcohol (23). The 
cardiovascular effects of alcohol abuse are not well characterized in population-based 
research. Indeed, this is generally difficult to study as the great majority of epidemiological 
studies rely on self-reported alcohol consumption, an ascertainment method known to be 
particularly inaccurate in individuals who drink heavily (24,25).
With evidence supporting cardiovascular protection and harm as a result of alcohol 
consumption, the question arises as to whether particular subgroups of patients might be 
more negatively impacted by alcohol consumption in regards to cardiovascular risk. No 
study has rigorously examined the interactions between alcohol use and known 
cardiovascular risk factors, likely because such interaction analyses requires substantial 
statistical power and therefore a particularly large number of subjects. We therefore 
leveraged data from every ambulatory surgical, emergency department, and inpatient 
encounter in California from 2005 through 2009 to evaluate the association between alcohol 
abuse and AF, MI, and CHF. We then identified subgroups most affected by these 
associations and determined the relative population-level burdens of AF, MI, and CHF that 
can be attributed to alcohol abuse.

 Methods
All California residents ≥21 years old who received care in a California ambulatory surgery 
unit, emergency department, or inpatient hospital unit between January 1, 2005 and 
December 31, 2009 were identified using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project 
(HCUP) California State Ambulatory Surgery Databases, Emergency Department Databases, 
and State Inpatient Databases (26). The individual HCUP databases specific to healthcare 
setting and calendar year were merged using an encrypted unique patient identifier to 
capture repeated visits for a given patient. Participants entered the cohort at first healthcare 
encounter and were censored upon incident diagnosis of the given outcome of interest (AF, 
MI, and CHF in separate analyses), at the time of inpatient death, or, in the absence of either, 
were administratively censored at the end of follow-up (December 31, 2009). Patients with 
residence outside of California or with missing visit date information were excluded, as well 
as patients with prevalent AF, MI, or CHF in the respective analyses (defined as carrying the 
diagnosis at the first recorded hospital encounter).
We recorded demographic data, including age, gender, race, and income at each healthcare 
encounter. Race and Hispanic ethnicity are reported separately in HCUP, and race was coded 
as either white or other for the vast majority of individuals with Hispanic ethnicity. 
Therefore, those with Hispanic ethnicity were treated as a distinct group that superseded the 
coded race. Income level was categorized by quartiles using the median household income 
for the patient’s ZIP code; observations with missing data had the value carried forward 
from the most recent encounter, and those patients without any income data over the study 
period were excluded. Up to 25 International Classification of Diseases–9th Edition (ICD-9) 
codes and 21 Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes were provided for each 
encounter. The specific codes used for alcohol abuse, covariates, and each outcome variable 
are described in Online Table 1.
Because postoperative AF after cardiothoracic surgery may have a different underlying 
mechanism than AF occurring outside of this acute surgical setting, AF was not recorded if a 
patient had undergone cardiothoracic surgery during the same hospitalization or within the 
previous 30 days (27). Such patients remained under observation and could be diagnosed 
with AF outside of this blanking period. As systolic heart failure is mechanistically different 
from heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, systolic dysfunction was the primary 
CHF outcome. A sensitivity analysis utilizing heart failure without systolic dysfunction 
alone was also performed. MI diagnoses were restricted to acute MI, and an a priori 
subgroup analysis was performed restricting the endpoint to ST-elevation MI (STEMI) only. 
Across each analysis, medical comorbidities postulated to confound or mediate the 
association between alcohol abuse coding and AF, MI, or CHF, respectively, were also 
recorded using ICD-9 and CPT codes. Dichotomous medical comorbidity variables were 
accumulated at each healthcare encounter and carried forward over time.
Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables with a normal distribution are presented as mean ± standard deviation. 
The cumulative incidences of AF, MI, and CHF were estimated, treating death as a 
competing risk in each. Because results treating deaths as a competing risk did not

 substantially differ from the standard estimates, Cox models were used to assess the 
independent effects of alcohol abuse, and to estimate cumulative incidence in both groups 
under a proportional hazards assumption. Cox proportional hazards models were used to 
investigate associations with incident events both before and after controlling for mediators 
and confounders. In these models, demographic characteristics and medical comorbidities 
were treated as time dependent covariates. All analyses were controlled for potential 
confounders identified a priori that were available in the dataset. The proportional hazards 
assumption was assessed using Kaplan–Meier versus predicted survival plots and log-minus-
log survival plots and was met for each outcome.
Effect modification of the relationship between alcohol abuse and the outcomes was 
assessed by testing for interactions with demographic characteristics and established 
cardiovascular risk factors. To enhance interpretation of these results, race was dichotomized 
as white versus non-white, and age was dichotomized as age < or ≥ to 60 years. Each 
interaction term was analyzed separately and adjusted for all other covariates. All interaction 
terms and potential confounders in each analysis were identified a priori from those 
available in the administrative dataset. Differences in absolute 3-year risks were calculated 
for each outcome, stratified by cardiovascular risk factors and presence or absence of alcohol 
abuse.
The population attributable risk for each outcome was calculated for all covariates in each 
model. Population attributable risk was estimated by calculating the ratio of the total excess 
risk associated with the exposure of interest to the total observed risk. Each measured 
comorbid exposure was compared to those in the cohort without that respective comorbidity. 
Confidence intervals for population attributable risk estimates were obtained using nonlinear 
combinations of estimators.
To assess the validity of the alcohol abuse codes, we examined the relationship between 
those codes and the incidence of the first diagnosis (in a separate encounter occurring after 
the first identification of an alcohol abuse code) of esophageal varices and hepatic cirrhosis 
using Cox proportional hazard models.
Analyses were performed using Stata 14 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas) and SAS 9.4 
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina). A 2-tailed P<0.05 was considered statistically 
significant. Certification to use de-identified HCUP data was obtained from the University of 
California, San Francisco Committee on Human Research.
Results
Of the 20,390,778 patients receiving care in California ambulatory surgery centers, 
emergency departments, and inpatient wards, 14,727,591 patients were included in analyses 
examining incident AF, MI, and CHF (Online Figure 1). During the study period, 268,084 
patients (1.8% of patients, with 6.3 events/1,000 person-years, 95% CI 6.3–6.4) were coded 
with an alcohol abuse diagnosis. Patient characteristics at baseline are provided in Table 1.

Table 2.
Validation Analyses
In an analysis intended to validate alcohol abuse coding in our model, presence of alcohol 
abuse coding resulted in an approximately 130-fold adjusted hazard of varices or cirrhosis 
(HR 132.6, 95% CI 130.7–134.4, P<0.0001) (Online Table 3 and Online Figure 2).
Alcohol and Atrial Fibrillation
After excluding patients with prevalent AF, 14,378,483 patients were included in the AF 
analysis, exhibiting 358,887 incident AF events (2.5%, 7.4 events/1,000 person-years, 95% 
CI 7.4–7.4). Alcohol abuse predicted a greater risk of incident AF (HR 1.93, 95% CI 1.88–
1.98, P <0.0001). After multivariable adjustment for age, gender, race, and presence of 
hypertension, diabetes, coronary disease, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, 
valvular heart disease, dyslipidemia, current smoking, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and 
income, those with alcohol abuse had a greater than two fold higher risk of AF (HR 2.14, 
95% CI 2.08–2.19, P <0.0001) (Figures 1 and 2. Unadjusted and sex and age adjusted only 
incidence curves are shown in Online Figures 3–5). The increased hazard of AF due to 
alcohol abuse was higher than the majority of well-established AF risk factors. The specific 
hazard ratios for each outcome are shown in Online Table 4.
With the exception of male sex and smoking, the relative increased risk of AF associated 
with alcohol abuse was significantly greater in the absence of established AF risk factors 
(Figure 3). While the enhanced risk in the setting of alcohol abuse was substantial in every 
group (Central Illustration), the lower baseline risk in patients without risk factors accounted 
for the significant interactions favoring a stronger relative effect in those patients.
Alcohol and Myocardial Infarction
Among 14,286,427 patients, incident MI was diagnosed in 157,254 individuals (1.1%, 3.1 
events/1,000 person-years, 95% CI 3.0–3.1). Presence of alcohol abuse increased the risk of 
acute MI both before (unadjusted HR 2.03, 95% CI 1.95–2.11, P<0.0001) and after 
adjustment for age, gender race, hypertension, diabetes, congestive heart failure, chronic 
kidney disease, dyslipidemia, current smoking, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and income, 
exhibited a relative risk similar to multiple well-established risk factors (adjusted HR 1.45, 
95% CI 1.4–1.51, P<0.0001) (Figures 1 and 2). This increase in risk associated with alcohol 
was of a magnitude similar to that of diabetes and obesity. When restricting these analyses to 
only STEMI as the outcome (N = 48,467 events, 0.3% of patients for an incidence rate of 
1.1 [95% CI 1.1–1.1] per 1,000 person/years), there remained a two-fold increased in risk in 
unadjusted analyses (HR 2.04, 95% CI 1.90–2.18, P <0.0001); this was attenuated, but still 
revealed a 30% increased risk after inclusion in the same adjusted model as used for all 
acute MIs (HR 1.30, 95% CI 1.21–1.39, P <0.0001).
Although the relative risk of alcohol abuse on MI was of lower magnitude compared to AF, a 
similar pattern was observed in interaction analyses by various subgroups: the relative risk 
was most prominent in the absence of risk factors (Figure 3), driven primarily by the

 particularly low baseline risk when conventional risk factors and alcohol abuse were both 
absent (Central Illustration).
Alcohol and Congestive Heart Failure
After exclusions, 14,043,590 patients remained in our model for the CHF outcome, 
revealing 411,983 incident CHF events (2.9%, 10.0 events/1,000 person-years, 95% CI 
10.0–10.0). Alcohol abuse imposed an unadjusted hazard ratio of 2.23 (95% CI 2.19–2.28, P 
<0.0001) in predicting incident CHF; the risk remained similar after adjusting for potential 
confounders (HR 2.34, 95% CI 2.29–2.39, P <0.0001) (Figure 1), exhibiting a similar 
relative hazard as well-established predictors such as hypertension and diabetes (Figure 2). 
In a sensitivity analysis, 858,604 patients exhibited the outcome of heart failure in the 
absence of systolic dysfunction. Alcohol abuse was associated with a three-fold higher risk 
of heart failure with preserved systolic function (adjusted HR 3.2, 95% CI 1.86–5.51). The 
results of the interaction analyses using this outcome were also similar to those obtained 
using the primary outcome of heart failure with systolic dysfunction, again demonstrating 
that younger age and the absence of hypertension especially enhanced the relative risk in the 
setting of alcohol abuse.
After stratification by risk factors for CHF, it was again those patients without a given risk 
factor that tended to be disproportionately affected by alcohol abuse (Figures 3 and 4).
Although hypertension and CHF were by far the most important contributors to the 
population attributable risk for each outcome, the population attributable risk for alcohol 
abuse on each outcome was similar in magnitude to the majority of well-established and at 
least theoretically modifiable risk factors (Figure 4).
Discussion
Leveraging state-wide ambulatory surgery visits, emergency room encounters, and 
hospitalizations in California over five consecutive years, we found that alcohol abuse was 
an important predictor of AF, MI, and CHF, exhibiting both relative hazards and population 
attributable risks similar to the majority of established modifiable risk factors in each case. 
Although alcohol abuse substantially heightened the risk in all subgroups, the relative 
increase in risk was observed most prominently among those without established risk 
factors.
There is much research into the role of alcohol, the nation’s most consumed drug (28), and 
its effect on cardiovascular disease, the principle threat to health in the United States (29). 
Even mild to moderate levels of alcohol consumption have been associated with increased 
risk of AF, yet this level of exposure has been demonstrated observational studies to 
decrease the risk of MI and CHF (10,11,13,14,30,31). The impact of the most extreme form 
of alcohol consumption, alcohol abuse, on these cardiovascular endpoints across the 
population has previously remained unknown.
A recent study examining access to alcohol as an instrumental variable among counties with 
various alcohol sales laws in Texas revealed a consistent association between greater alcohol

 access and AF and inconsistent results regarding MI and HF (32). While the paper utilized 
novel ecological methods to demonstrate important health effects related to alcohol 
exposure, a major limitation of the study was the inability to examine variable degrees of 
that exposure. Indeed, the impact of the most extreme form of alcohol consumption, alcohol 
abuse, on these cardiovascular endpoints across the population has previously remained 
unknown.
Given the association of AF with cardiovascular complications and death (27,33) and few 
interventions to this point that modify that risk (34,35), prevention of AF is paramount. 
While the data in favor of an association between alcohol consumption and AF are 
conflicting (14,34,35), the majority of studies suggest that chronic alcohol consumption 
increases the risk for incident AF (18). The great majority of these studies have relied on 
participant self-report and none was able to examine interactions by various participant 
characteristics. Among common risk factors for AF, our data demonstrate that only CHF is a 
stronger risk factor than alcohol abuse. There was a disproportionate effect of alcohol abuse 
in predicting AF in patients who lacked other known risk factors for AF, suggesting that 
alcohol abuse may be a particularly important cause of lone AF. Interaction analyses 
revealed that younger patients and those without hypertension exhibited a particularly 
disproportionately heightened relative risk of AF. This demonstrates that the mechanisms of 
AF in the context of alcohol abuse do not rely on atrial changes that occur with age or 
hypertension, perhaps suggesting an electrical rather than a structural effect. Conversely, 
alcohol abuse did not appear to confer increased risk associated with male sex or smoking, 
perhaps suggesting that these share common mechanistic pathways that promote AF.
Despite the preponderance of observational literature favoring a protective effect of alcohol 
on MI risk (11–15), our data demonstrate the reverse – an increased risk of MI (whether 
including all acute MIs or only STEMIs) both before and after multivariable adjustment. 
Taken along with prior literature on gradations of alcohol consumption and MI risk, these 
data on alcohol abuse therefore suggest that the impact of alcohol consumption on incident 
MI may mirror the “U-shaped curve” found with alcohol consumption and overall mortality 
(36–38) and are consistent with the observation that acute binges of alcohol increase the risk 
of MI (39). Of interest, a recent analysis suggests that the apparent protective effect of light 
to moderate drinking on mortality maybe confounded by physical activity and perceived 
health status (40). Therefore, our findings may simply better elucidate the harmful effects of 
alcohol related to MI by examining alcohol in excess as the predictor. Although the 
magnitude of increased risk for MI was lower than for AF (30% versus more than a two-fold 
increased risk), again alcohol abuse appears to confer both an increased relative risk and 
population attributable risk similar to well-established modifiable risk factors. In no 
circumstance did the absence of a cardiovascular comorbidity display a protective effect 
against the increased MI risk among those with alcohol abuse. Alcohol abuse had a 
negligible impact in increasing the relative risk among those with chronic kidney disease, 
dyslipidemia, smoking, and obesity, perhaps related to alcohol’s favorable effects on lipid 
profiles (41–47). Importantly, in each case, although the relative risk of alcohol abuse was 
not different in those with and without these risk factors, the absolute risk was increased in 
every case, demonstrating the important impact in these populations. In patients without 
these diseases, the ill effects of alcohol are especially severe regarding MI risk. Clearly, it is

 not appropriate to extrapolate from evidence regarding moderate drinking that “more is 
better” in terms of MI risk, arguing for the importance of moderation even in regards to an 
outcome where alcohol has demonstrated some benefit.
While alcoholic cardiomyopathy is known to occur in the setting of alcohol abuse (48,49), 
the population-level effects of alcohol abuse on incident CHF remain unclear. Indeed, 
several large studies have demonstrated that moderate alcohol consumption may have a 
protective effect against CHF (7–9). Our data show a more than two-fold increased risk of 
CHF with alcohol abuse in the general population – an even stronger predictive association 
than many other established risk factors, including hypertension. Interestingly, we were 
unable to identify any meaningful differences in our sensitivity analyses restricting the 
outcome to heart failure in the presence or absence of systolic dysfunction, suggesting 
volume overload due to excessive alcohol may occur due to mechanisms more complicated 
than simply weakening the ventricles. Stratification by patient characteristics for incident 
CHF yielded similar results to that of AF and MI: healthier patients tended to exhibit a 
disproportionately greater relative risk of CHF in the setting of alcohol abuse. Interestingly, 
just as with AF, the most diametric interactions were observed when stratifying by age and 
by presence of hypertension, again implicating some distinct mechanistic pathway regarding 
alcohol-induced myocardial toxicity versus age-related or hypertensive cardiomyopathy.
On a population level, the risk of AF, MI, and CHF that could be attributed to alcohol was 
on a par with multiple other established risk factors. Extrapolating from our data to the 
estimated prevalence of each outcome, a theoretical complete eradication of alcohol abuse 
would result in over 73,000 fewer AF cases, 34,000 fewer MIs, and 91,000 fewer patients 
with CHF in the US alone (3).
This study had several important limitations. HCUP relies on physician coding; however, 
coding for alcohol abuse, AF, MI, and CHF have been shown to be highly specific with 
variable sensitivity (50–54). Importantly, limited sensitivity would be expected only to 
decrease power and would not be expected to result in false positives. Research using these 
methods and particularly the HCUP database in this regard is nonetheless a powerful tool 
and an accepted approach for large population studies (26,55,56). Some potential 
confounders are not measured by ICD-9 codes, such as specific diets or levels of activity; 
however, we adjusted for demographic information, smoking, and obesity, which may 
parallel and even direct reflect many of these unmeasured factors (57,58). Smoking in 
particular may be an important confounder underlying the observation that alcohol abuse 
was associated with a higher risk of MI. However, the prevalence of smoking ascertained 
from HCUP of 8% is of a similar magnitude to the estimate of 13% provided by the Center 
for Disease Control and Prevention in California over that same time period (59); 
importantly, approximately 18% of those who abused alcohol were coded as smokers in 
HCUP versus approximately 4% of patient who did not abuse alcohol. Given the effects 
observed for smoking on MI and assuming under-ascertainment of smoking (if present) was 
non-differential (which we believe to be conservative as smoking was more likely more 
often coded among those also coded with alcohol abuse), we calculated that 82% of those 
with alcohol abuse would have had to also smoke cigarettes to explain the increased hazard 
of MI observed. While we cannot exclude this possibility, we do not believe such a high

 prevalence of smoking in California over this time period, particularly given the CDC-based 
estimates, is likely. In addition, use of physician coding eliminates the important bias of 
patient self-report that had been prevalent in studies on this topic to this point. We further 
validated our primary predictor (alcohol abuse) by demonstrating exceedingly strong 
associations with esophageal varices and cirrhosis; that well-established risk factors 
predicted AF, MI, and CHF as expected also serves to validate our covariates and outcomes. 
Our endpoints fail to capture any outpatient encounters, which has particular relevance to the 
potentially insensitive diagnoses of alcohol abuse and AF. However, by capturing patients 
treated in ambulatory procedural units, emergency departments, and inpatient settings, we 
likely studied the sicker cohort of patients with alcohol abuse and these cardiovascular 
outcomes and certainly captured those responsible for the majority of healthcare utilization. 
As with any observational study, we cannot exclude residual confounding as an explanation 
for our results. However, we adjusted for conventionally recognized confounders in as 
exhaustive a fashion as possible and as appropriate. Finally, it is important to emphasize that 
these data cannot prove causality. In addition, while the population attributable risk 
calculations must be interpreted with this caution, we believe such estimates provide 
substantial value in modeling potential public health impacts given a common and 
theoretically modifiable condition such as alcohol abuse.
Finally, by relying on physician coding of alcohol abuse, the proportion of alcohol abusers 
identified in our study is approximately one third of national estimates (6), and we were not 
able to comment on the quantity of alcohol. While this limits our ability to determine 
specific amounts that may be harmful, it also very accurately and specifically identifies 
patients wherein alcohol abuse was not only recognized but also clinically documented by a 
healthcare professional. Therefore, while treating or preventing alcohol abuse is no doubt 
challenging, in our study the predictor is already recognized by at least one healthcare 
professional, suggesting that these are the patients already accessible to possible intervention 
within the current healthcare system. That some patients who suffer from alcohol abuse were 
not identified as such in our study has the likely effect of biasing the results toward the null, 
suggesting that the association between alcohol abuse and cardiac disease may be even more 
marked than measured in the current study.
Conclusions
Alcohol abuse increases the risk of incident AF, MI, and CHF, exhibiting magnitudes of risk 
similar to other well-established risk factors. Although nearly all subgroups exhibited 
increased risk in the setting of alcohol abuse, those without a given risk factor for each 
outcome were disproportionately prone to enhanced cardiovascular risk. The risk of AF, MI, 
and CHF that can be attributed to alcohol abuse is large, suggesting that efforts to mitigate 
this addictive disease might result in substantial reductions of cardiac disease. Taken 
together, these data demonstrate that alcohol in excess should not be considered cardio-
protective, but rather cardio-toxic, contributing to heightened risk for all three major, yet 
distinct, cardiac adverse outcomes.

 PERSPECTIVES
Competency in Medical Knowledge
Alcohol abuse increases the risk of atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction (MI), and 
heart failure to an extent similar to that of other strong risk factors, and affects healthier 
individuals disproportionately. Protective effects of alcohol against MI are outweighed at 
heavy levels of consumption by its adverse effects.
Translational Outlook
More research is needed to understand the mechanisms by which alcohol influences the 
risk of cardiac disease in specific populations.

 Figure 1. Cumulative Probability of Atrial Fibrillation, Myocardial Infarction, and Congestive 
Heart Failure by Presence or Absence of Alcohol Abuse
These curves were generated under a proportional hazards assumption. Each model is 
adjusted for age, sex, race, hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease (for the AF and 
CHF outcomes), congestive heart failure (for the AF and MI outcomes), chronic kidney 
disease, valvular heart disease (for the AF and CHF outcomes), dyslipidemia, obesity, 
obstructive sleep apnea, cigarette smoking, and income.

Baseline characteristics are for patients included in the incident myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation analyses; individuals with prevalent MI, CHF, and AF have been 
excluded from each analysis, respectively. CAD, coronary artery disease; CHF, congestive heart failure; CKD, chronic kidney disease; DL, dyslipidemia; DM, diabetes; OSA, obstructive sleep apnea; SD, 
standard deviation; Smoking, current cigarette smoking; VHD, valvular heart disease.
Dichotomous variables (using Chi2 Test) and continuous variables (using Student’s t-test) were compared within each analysis – P<0.0001 for all comparisons, except in CHF analysis: CAD, P=0.264, 
VHD, P=0.007; Obese, P=0.063; OSA, P=0.004
