Abstract
Safety of pregnancy in women with history of estrogen receptor (ER)–positive breast cancer remains controversial. In this
multicenter case–control study, 333 patients with pregnancy after breast cancer were matched (1:3) to 874 nonpregnant
patients of similar characteristics, adjusting for guaranteed time bias. Survival estimates were calculated using the Kaplan-
Meier analysis; groups were compared with the log-rank test. All reported P values were two-sided. At a median follow-up of
7.2 years after pregnancy, no difference in disease-free survival was observed between pregnant and nonpregnant patients
with ER-positive (hazard ratio [HR] ¼ 0.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] ¼ 0.70 to 1.26, P ¼ .68) or ER-negative (HR ¼ 0.75, 95%
CI ¼ 0.53 to 1.06, P ¼ .10) disease. No overall survival (OS) difference was observed in ER-positive patients (HR ¼ 0.84, 95%
CI ¼ 0.60 to 1.18, P ¼ .32); ER-negative patients in the pregnant cohort had better OS (HR ¼ 0.57, 95% CI ¼ 0.36 to 0.90, P ¼ .01).
Abortion, time to pregnancy, breastfeeding, and type of adjuvant therapy had no impact on patients’ outcomes. This study
provides reassuring evidence on the long-term safety of pregnancy in breast cancer survivors, including those with ER-
positive disease.
Many physicians and patients remain concerned about the
safety of pregnancy in breast cancer survivors, especially in
women previously diagnosed with estrogen receptor (ER)–
positive disease in whom pregnancy could be regarded as po-
tentially detrimental by means of endocrine stimulation (1–3).
Prior results of our study showed that a subsequent pregnancy
had no negative impact on breast cancer outcomes irrespective
of ER status; however, median follow-up was relatively short
(4.7 years after pregnancy) (4). Considering that women with ER-
positive disease remain at increased risk of long-term recur-
rence (5), these results might not have provided the needed
reassurance regarding the safety of pregnancy in these patients.
Here, we provide updated survival analysis at median follow-up
of 7.2 years after pregnancy.
Details of study design and statistical analysis were previ-
ously reported (4). Briefly, this is a multicenter case–control
study in which women who had a pregnancy after breast cancer
(pregnant cohort) were matched (1:3) to nonpregnant patients
(nonpregnant cohort) according to ER status, nodal status, adju-
vant treatments, age, and year of diagnosis. To adjust for guar-
anteed time bias, each nonpregnant patient should have been
disease-free for a minimum time not inferior to the time

 elapsing between breast cancer diagnosis and pregnancy in the
matched pregnant case. The study was approved by the ethics
committees of all participating institutions. No written in-
formed consent was required.
The primary objective was disease-free survival (DFS) in ER-
positive patients. DFS was calculated from the date of concep-
tion (or a similar time point in the nonpregnant cohort). DFS in
ER-negative patients was secondary end point, as was overall
survival (OS). Predefined subgroup analysis investigated the im-
pact of abortion, time to pregnancy, and breastfeeding on DFS.
Exploratory analyses included DFS according to prior exposure
to chemotherapy and duration of adjuvant endocrine therapy in
ER-positive patients in the pregnant cohort.
OS and DFS estimates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier
analysis, and groups were compared with the log-rank test. Cox
regression semiparametric models were used to calculate the
hazard
ratios
(HRs;
pregnant
vs
nonpregnant)
with
95%
confidence intervals (CIs). The cutoff date for analysis was
December 2016. All reported P values were two-sided, with val-
ues of less than .05 considered statistically significant.
A total of 333 and 874 women were included in the pregnant
and nonpregnant cohorts, respectively, of whom 56.8% (n ¼ 686)
had ER-positive breast cancer (4). Baseline characteristics were
well balanced, with the exception of younger age and more fre-
quent breast-conserving surgery in the pregnant cohort (4).
Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the pregnant cohort.
The median follow-up was 9.6 years from breast cancer diag-
nosis (7.2 years after pregnancy, interquartile range ¼ 4.8 to
8.7 years). No DFS difference was shown between the pregnant
and nonpregnant cohorts in ER-positive (HR ¼ 0.94, 95% CI ¼ 0.70
to 1.26, P ¼ .68) (Figure 1A) or ER-negative (HR ¼ 0.75, 95%
CI ¼ 0.53 to 1.06, P ¼ .10) (Figure 1B) patients. Similarly, there
was no OS difference between the two cohorts in ER-positive
patients (HR ¼ 0.84, 95% CI ¼ 0.60 to 1.18, P ¼ .32) (Figure 1C). Yet,
a better OS was observed in the pregnant cohort for ER-negative
patients (HR ¼ 0.57, 95% CI ¼ 0.36 to 0.90, P ¼ .01) (Figure 1D).
Predefined subgroup analyses did not suggest any impact of
abortion,
time
to
pregnancy,
or
breastfeeding
on
DFS.
Pregnancy outcome was available in 323 (97.0%) women in the
pregnant cohort. As compared with matched women from the
nonpregnant cohort, no difference in DFS was observed in
patients
who
completed
their
pregnancy
(HR ¼ 0.85,
95%
CI ¼ 0.63 to 1.14, P ¼ .27), nor in those who had an abortion
(HR ¼ 0.80, 95% CI ¼ 0.56 to 1.13, P ¼ .20) (Supplementary Figure
1A, available online), with no statistically significant heterogen-
ity observed (Pinteraction ¼ .80).
An interval of two years was used to evaluate the potential
impact of time to pregnancy after breast cancer diagnosis on
DFS. As compared with matched women from the nonpregnant
cohort, a statistically significantly better DFS was shown in
patients who became pregnant less than two years from breast
cancer diagnosis (HR ¼ 0.65, 95% CI ¼ 0.47 to 0.90, P ¼ .008), and
no difference in DFS was observed in patients who became
pregnant two or more years from breast cancer diagnosis (HR ¼
1.12, 95% CI ¼ 0.82 to 1.54, P ¼ .47) (Supplementary Figure 1B,
available
online),
with
statistically
heterogeneity
observed
(Pinteraction ¼ .02). As previously reported (4), patients in the non-
pregnant group who were matched with those who became
pregnant two or more years from diagnosis tended to have a rel-
atively longer disease-free interval as compared with women
who were matched with patients who became pregnant less
than two years from diagnosis. On comparing the outcome of
patients who became pregnant either less or more than two
years from breast cancer diagnosis, no DFS difference was ob-
served between both groups, even after adjusting for tumor and
treatment characteristics (unadjusted HR ¼ 1.22, 95% CI ¼ 0.83 to
1.80, P ¼ .31; adjusted HR ¼ 1.10, 95% CI ¼ 0.70 to 1.75, P ¼ .67;
data not shown). Hence, the improved outcome of patients who

 became pregnant earlier seemed to be the result of selection
bias rather than a true protective effect of early pregnancy.
Out of 188 patients with completed pregnancy, 64 (34.0%)
had available information on breastfeeding. As compared with
matched women from the nonpregnant cohort, no difference in
DFS was observed in patients who breastfed their newborns
(HR ¼ 0.70, 95% CI ¼ 0.26 to 1.94, P ¼ .50) or in those who did not
(HR ¼ 1.44, 95% CI ¼ 0.77 to 2.69, P ¼ .25) (Supplementary Figure
1C, available online), with no statistically significant heterogen-
ity observed (Pinteraction ¼ .24). Exploratory subgroup analyses in
patients with ER-positive disease in the pregnant cohort did not
suggest any impact of adjuvant therapy on DFS (Supplementary
Table 1, available online).
This report provides long-term results of the largest study to
date addressing the safety of pregnancy according to ER status.
In addition, we provide for the first time subgroup analyses
showing the lack of apparent detrimental effect of breastfeeding
and type of adjuvant therapy on patients’ outcomes. These
results reinforce the notion that pregnancy should not be dis-
couraged after breast cancer, even in women with history of ER-
positive disease.
Timing of subsequent pregnancy remains a challenging
question to address in clinical practice. Previously, two studies
showed a trend toward increased risk of recurrence in patients
conceiving within six and 12 months after diagnosis (6,7). Our
study, which included nearly three times the number of preg-
nant patients, showed that the timing of pregnancy does not
appear to have a major impact on outcomes. These findings
suggest that an individualized approach should be adopted tak-
ing into account parameters including patient’s age, risk of re-
currence, adjuvant therapy, and ovarian reserve. This is of
particular relevance for ER-positive patients in whom the need
for five to 10 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy may substan-
tially reduce their chance of conception (8). In clinical practice,
several of these women are offered temporary interruption of
endocrine therapy to allow pregnancy (9). Addressing the safety
of such an approach in patients who have received 18 to
30 months of endocrine therapy is the subject of the ongoing
IBCSG-BIG-NABCG POSITIVE study (NCT02308085) (9).
Physicians’ and patients’ fear toward a possible detrimental
effect of pregnancy after breast cancer might partially explain
the high rate of induced abortion observed in our study

 (approximately 30%) as well as others (6,7). Our results confirm
that abortion does not influence patients’ survival, underscor-
ing that it should not be promoted for therapeutic purposes.
This remains the only report addressing the safety of breast-
feeding after breast cancer. Despite the limited information, we
believe it would help in counseling women inquiring into the
safety of this approach. Results of the POSITIVE study are
awaited to give further insights on this important issue.
Some limitations should be highlighted, including the retro-
spective nature of the study, the absence of information on
HER2 status for the majority of patients, and the possibility that
some pregnant patients could have been subjected to restaging
before considering pregnancy. Furthermore, information on the
use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) was only avail-
able for a minority of patients. The results of this subgroup have
been recently reported, showing no apparent detrimental effect
of
performing
ART
after
completion
of
breast
cancer
treatment (10).
In conclusion, our updated results provide reassuring evi-
dence on the long-term safety of pregnancy in breast cancer
survivors, including those with ER-positive disease. These find-
ings are of great importance to guiding treating physicians in
counseling young breast cancer survivors in this regard.
