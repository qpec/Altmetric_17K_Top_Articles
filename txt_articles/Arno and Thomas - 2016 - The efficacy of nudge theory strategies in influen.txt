The efficacy of nudge theory strategies in
influencing adult dietary behaviour: a
systematic review and meta-analysis
Anneliese Arno* and Steve Thomas
Abstract
Background: Obesity has become a world-wide epidemic and is spreading to countries with emerging economies.
Previously tested interventions are often too costly to maintain in the long term. This leaves a need for improved
strategies for management of the epidemic. Nudge Theory presents a new collection of methods, deemed “nudges”,
which have the potential for low-cost and broad application to guide healthier lifestyle choices without the need for
restrictive regulation. There has not yet been a large-scale examination of the effectiveness of nudges, despite several
policy making bodies now considering their use.
Methods: To address this gap in knowledge, an adapted systematic review methodology was used to collect and
consolidate results from current Nudge papers and to determine whether Nudge strategies are successful in changing
adults’ dietary choices for healthier ones.
Results: It was found that nudges resulted in an average 15.3 % increase in healthier dietary or nutritional choices, as
measured by a change in frequency of healthy choices or a change in overall caloric consumption. All of the included
studies were from wealthy nations, with a particular emphasis on the United States with 31 of 42 included experiments.
Conclusions: This analysis demonstrates Nudge holds promise as a public health strategy to combat obesity. More
research is needed in varied settings, however, and future studies should aim to replicate previous results in
more geographically and socioeconomically diverse countries.

Background
Despite widespread education and healthy eating cam-
paigns, the prevalence of excessive body weight remains
stubbornly high in many countries such as the United
States, the United Kingdom, and Mexico while steadily
climbing in others, including India and China [1].
From these climbing rates it would appear that most
interventions previously attempted by public health
policy are insufficiently effective. While there are several
intensive interventions which have shown success in
altering individuals’ body-mass indices (BMI) as well as
their nutritional choices, these are largely short-term
successes [2]. Moreover, they require massive time and
monetary resources for each individual targeted. Many
only function at a small scale, in isolated and easily
tracked communities. Hence, these previously tested
interventions are highly inefficient and would be too
costly to implement at a national or population level
[3]. Moreover, a less costly population-level interven-
tion would enable under-resourced government bodies
an affordable option, and encourage better health
equity in the long term.
This situation demands that public health practi-
tioners seek alternative strategies and interventions, in
particular, those which could be applied at a population
level and are a better value for public spending. From a
public health standpoint, people are not generally mak-
ing good decisions for their own health, or indeed for
the health of society at large. It seems that individuals
“irrationally” choose to ignore health warnings about
obesity
and
recommendations
for their nutritional
choices, forming the basis of the obesity issue. Despite

 their irrational behaviour, predictable patterns may none-
theless be discernible when examined carefully. If research
can reveal a method to use these patterns to encourage
people to tend towards healthier options rather than the
short-term pleasurable choices, a novel and powerful
strategy to fight obesity may be established. Importantly,
such a strategy would improve population health without
coercion or restrictive legislation, instead using the sub-
conscious processes present in all individual choices to
gain a favourable outcome.
Nudge theory
These assertions are the central tenets of Nudge Theory,
a new collection of ideas put forth by Thaler and Sunstein
in their 2008 book, Nudge: Improving decisions about
Health, Wealth, and Happiness [4]. The authors contend
that there exists a “choice architecture” which involves all
of the outside forces that may subtly guide one’s decisions
in one direction or another. Given the unavoidable exist-
ence of a choice architecture, the crucial next assumption
is that a choice architect exists as well: a person or collec-
tion of persons who design the environment in order to
make a certain option more likely to be chosen. For in-
stance, items placed at eye-level in a supermarket may be
selected more frequently than those near the floor. An-
other example might be manipulations to perception of
serving sizes by using smaller serving utensils.
This benignly intentioned manipulation is labelled as
“libertarian paternalism”, meant to improve the direc-
tions of people’s choices while maintaining freedom of
choice. With this approach, they aim to reap the benefits
of strong governmental oversight without the restrictive
regulations and negative consequences. Nudge and liber-
tarian paternalism are not necessarily new ideas, but the
collation of these ideas within one umbrella term is a
novel field. Consequently, not much work has been done
in order to test the efficacy of adjustments in the choice
architecture. Most of the previous work around these
ideas has been speculative, and the field has been
dominated by an ongoing debate about the morality
of libertarian paternalism, which some consider to be
an infringement of individual freedom of choice (e.g.,
[5, 6]). This focus on the ethics has left a gap in the
literature as to whether or not nudge is an effective
strategy for combatting obesity. Nudge previously has
been examined in individual studies for its capacity to
positively influence several other behaviours, including
decreasing tobacco-use, increasing physical exercise,
and encouraging financial planning, as described in
[7]. However, it has not been systematically and quan-
titatively assessed for its effectiveness.
Much of the previous experimentation that would be
classified as Nudge today was thus not originally pub-
lished
under
this
term,
despite
the
fact
that
the
interventions used would indeed fall under that category.
Nevertheless, as governments have begun to use Nudge
Theory strategies as a public health policy informer [7],
it is essential to determine how effective a strategy it is.
A previous systematic review [8] showed the majority of
current Nudge literature is in the area of nutritional re-
search, and as nutrition lies at the heart of one of the
greatest health threats in the world – obesity – it seems
a reasonable place to begin to answer a fundamental
question: Does Nudge work, or does it not?
Scope of research
In order to have a proper debate about whether to use
these nudges, and particularly how to use them, it must
first be understood whether or not they actually work.
To do that, existing literature must be examined and the
results compiled into an easily understood and commu-
nicated ‘bottom line’. Systematic reviews and meta-
analyses have been established as an effective means of
collecting and summarising current data and determin-
ing effectiveness of specific interventions for use in
health care and policy [9]. Therefore, this research used
this methodology to answer the research questions.
Methods
Research question
This review endeavoured to answer the following pri-
mary research question:
Is nudge theory an effective strategy in influencing
adults aged 18 to 65 to change their dietary choices for
healthier ones?
Definition of terms
Healthier food was defined as more nutrient dense,
lower calorie, lower salt, lower sugar, lower cholesterol,
or lower fat. This definition was based on previous lit-
erature [10, 11]. More nutrient dense outcomes included
consumption or purchase of more vegetables, fruits,
whole grains, and other items reasonably identified and
justified in the literature as healthy alternatives. Health-
ier outcomes also included decreased consumption of
foods identified as “unhealthy,” such as snacks high in
fat, salt, or sugar. Because healthier outcomes included
both overall caloric consumption as well as nutrient
dense food consumption, the terms ‘dietary’ and ‘nutri-
tional’ are used interchangeably in this report.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
In addition to ensuring included studies were strictly
responding to the research question, inclusion and
exclusion criteria were also designed to exclude any
study which demonstrated any risk of bias. These cri-
teria are described in more detail in the correspond-
ing sections below.

 Population
In conjunction with the study question, only studies
aimed at adults were used. Adulthood was defined by
both legal and employment norms – i.e., a minimum
of 18 years to a maximum 65 years of age. The age
of 65 was selected as the upper limit because it is the
age of retirement in many developed countries, while
the lower limit of 18 is typical for the majority of
legal recognitions. Studies with a
range including
above 65 (e.g., 22 to 75 years old) were included so
long as the median age of participants remains below
65. In contrast, any study including children under 18
as well as adults was not included, unless the data
was detailed in sub-group analysis allowing the re-
searchers to only use adult data. Children under the
age of 18 are the subjects of many studies, but these
interventions would likely not be applicable to the
general population as they would predominantly take
place in schools. Finally, studies were not required to
cover this entire age range, but were allowed to cover
only a portion (e.g., 18–22 year olds).
Experiments were also required to include both
men and women for the sake of general population
value of the results. Numerous studies have noted
that men and women respond differently to dietary
interventions [12–14], and results obtained from only
one gender may therefore be skewed. Indeed, many of
the papers reviewed at the full-text and abstract level
showed different results and levels of significance for
the men and women included in the study. Studies
using convenience sampling methods were not re-
quired to report the sample’s gender balance. For
laboratory-based trials, however, included studies were
not permitted to have a ratio higher than 70–30 in
either direction.
Studies were excluded if participants were exclu-
sively patients of a specific medical ailment, such as
diabetes. Similarly, the subject pool could not be lim-
ited to obese or overweight people, as they would
have well-documented differences in appetite, satiety,
and restraint ratings [15]. Laboratory studies were re-
quired to exclude already-dieting participants, as they
may have abnormal baseline eating patterns. Several
studies included restraint ratings in their participant
characteristics.
Results
for
“restrained”
and
“unre-
strained” eaters were pooled in some cases to remove
this confounding effect.
In summary, included studies had to be aimed at a
generic population, and not be primarily focused on a
subset (e.g., women, diabetics, current dieters, etc.).
Studies which reported sub-group analyses were not
automatically excluded, provided they reported aggre-
gated results or sufficient raw data to independently
combine sub-group results in secondary analysis.
Study design
Studies must have been aimed at influencing behav-
iour relating to food consumption. Those focusing ex-
clusively on beverages or alcohol consumption were
not accepted. All study designs were accepted given
they included a form of control or baseline compara-
tor. For studies with parallel intervention groups, allo-
cation of interventions had to be randomised, and
baseline characteristics reported to ensure no signifi-
cant pre-treatment group differences. Qualitative stud-
ies
were
excluded,
though
papers
providing
both
qualitative and quantitative data were included so
long as the quantitative data was reported according
to the other standards described in this section.
Interventions (Comparisons)
Fundamentally, the intervention of interest must change
the choice architecture while maintaining the autonomy
of the test subject. Alterations to choice architecture
include changes to the environment (e.g., olfactory or
social), perception (e.g., emotional priming), availability of
food (such as convenience or portion size), or knowledge-
based changed (e.g., labelling). Any intervention which
involved directly asking tests subjects about the experi-
mental condition was excluded, as it would bias the partic-
ipants. Similarly, interventions were not accepted which
changed the fundamental properties of the food, such as
energy density or fat content. Food appearance could be
altered, however, such as a change in food unit size,
colour, or odour. No options could be forbidden to the
consumer or test subject, and no direct financial incentive
to a participant could be involved.
Many of the reviewed and included studies examined
several interventions simultaneously. For those examin-
ing both nudge and a non-nudge strategy, such as menu
arrangement and pricing, respectively, results were re-
quired to be reported as a main effect of the nudge. If
only the interaction effect was reported, the study was
excluded.
Outcomes
Results had to be presented in terms of one of the follow-
ing: calories, joules, grams, or purchases (either quantity
purchased or a monetary amount). These had to be mea-
sured either directly or via purchase receipts; Participants
were not permitted to report their own intake. Both abso-
lute measurements and those reporting a change relative
to baseline were accepted.
Studies which did not report a measurement of error –
standard deviation, standard error, or confidence interval
– were excluded. Studies that provided sufficient raw data
for the independent secondary calculation of error, how-
ever, were included.

 Search strategy
The initial search strategy was based on a snowball
method using the references from previously published
similar systematic reviews, in particular [8]. Any other
reviews identified during the preliminary search were
also used to snowball articles, though these largely re-
sulted in duplicates. These articles were reviewed at the
title level to immediately identify those to be excluded.
Those that were tentatively included were then reviewed
at the abstract level, followed by the full text for those
that continued to fit the criteria.
Following
completion
of
screening
of
records
retrieved via snowball, a systematic search of several
databases was completed. The methodology for the
search was adapted from [8]. The databases used were:
EconLit, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, PubMed, and
the Cochrane Library. As a final check point, Google
Scholar was used to ensure the majority of literature
had been screened.
Search terms included combinations, plurals, and
various conjugations of the words relating to identi-
fied nudge strategies. The search strategy from [8]
was used as a basis for search terms, but adjusted to
reflect the more specific nutritional aim of this thesis.
Studies published in the decade prior to the comple-
tion
of
our
search
phase
(i.e.,
2004–2014)
were
eligible for this review.
Following retrieval of all records, duplicates were re-
moved and records screened at the title level. Records
were reviewed at title and abstract level simultaneously
if this option was available via the database. Those not
excluded due to key words in the titles were then
reviewed at the abstract level. This was followed by a
full text examination to finally determine inclusion or
exclusion. Figure 1 summarises the search strategy and
provides details of numbers of records at each stage.
All searching, screening, and data extraction was com-
pleted by author AA. Author ST approved the search
and screening protocols, checked results of screening
following full text review, and statistical results after data
extraction and final calculations.
Statistical analysis
In order to be able to compare heterogeneous out-
comes, results were calculated as the absolute value
percent change in frequency of a choice, or in con-
sumption/purchases. These values were compiled into
a forest plot and weighted according to their variance
in order to demonstrate an overall trend in nudge
intervention outcomes. The calculations necessary for
the forest plot, including weighting of studies according to
sample size and variance, were conducted using a previ-
ously published template [16]. This method of weighting
results is in line with previously published reviews [9].
Statistical analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel
2010, while descriptive analyses of the included studies
were performed using IBM SPSS v.21.

 Results
Included study characteristics
This review identified 37 eligible papers [12, 17–52],
with five included that reported results from several
discrete experiments, resulting in 42 individual study
results. Of these, 31, or 74 %, were randomised control
trials (RCTs), two (5 %) were cohort studies, and nine
(21 %) were cross-sectional studies. Laboratories were the
most frequent study setting, accounting for 48 % of the in-
cluded papers followed by canteens with 17 %. A notable
majority of studies took place in the United States, and all
were conducted in relatively wealthy Global North na-
tions. Sample sizes used were most often below 100, with
a further 31 % using between 100 and 500 participants.
All of this information can be found in Table 1.
Meta-analysis
When each study was weighted according to previously
published methods [16], this analysis demonstrated that
nudge interventions on average cause a 15.3 % (95 %
confidence: 7.58, 23.0) increase in healthier consumption
decisions, as measured by frequency of healthy choices
or by overall intake. This result is shown in Fig. 2.
Discussion
This analysis demonstrates that overall, nudge strategies
successfully increase healthy nutritional choices. This re-
view also demonstrated the current availability of evidence
relating to Nudges and food policy, and highlighted the lit-
erature’s weaknesses. Our work built significantly upon
the results of Hollands et al. (2013) by performing meta-
analysis on the results of many studies initially identified
in that work.
A significant limitation of this review is the lack of
inter-rater reliability data due to the methods used, in
which all studies were screened by a single reviewer
with the second acting as a check point following
completion of each screening stage. However, given
the reasonable consistency of results across the arti-
cles it would suggest that this is not a major problem
for the overall findings. Nevertheless, the validity of
this work could have been improved by using a larger
team for screening and reporting an inter-rater reli-
ability metric such as Cohen’s Kappa.
As with any systematic review, this review and its results
were limited by the presence of heterogeneous results and
studies. Despite the presence of several sources of hetero-
geneity in this study’s included papers, discussed in the
succeeding section, these are unlikely to have a large effect
on the overall findings.
Firstly, the included studies differed in the precise popu-
lation targeted. For example, a record retrieved during an
initial trial search was aimed at a particular socioeconomic
demographic by nature of its geographical setting. It is
possible that interventions specifically designed for one
demographic may not apply to another, or that compiling
the results of such interventions could present heterogen-
eity to the results. However, by not excluding these stud-
ies, it was hoped to maintain the generalizability of these
findings, as an entire population would include a plethora
of socioeconomic statuses.
Similarly, that 100 % of the included studies were con-
ducted in Global North nations, with a particular em-
phasis on the United States, may weaken the ability of
the results of this review to be extrapolated to a more
worldwide population, or to be applied in different na-
tional settings. This exclusive focus on relatively wealthy
nations is indicative of an over-emphasis of obesity re-
search on those nations; although this focus may be
valid given the health trends of the past several decades,
emerging economies are also poised to suffer the next
wave of obesity and overweight, and this situation must
be addressed.
A significant source of heterogeneity will likely arise,
as in many past reviews, from the differences in how re-
searchers measured their results. Results were evaluated
as a proportional change in behaviour, outcome, or sta-
tus, in order to be able to compile different results into
one cohesive statement. While selection of this measure
was necessary in order to be able to compile paper re-
sults and perform meta-analysis, it did necessitate the
exclusion of some studies on the basis of lack of specific
statistical data. Thus differences in measurement of out-
comes not only presented heterogeneity of results calcu-
lated in this meta-analysis, but also shrank the pool of
available data for statistical analysis. With more rigid
reporting measures, the statistical results of this review
could be updated to provide more robust results, such
as effect size
Though nearly a third of the included papers reported
a statistically insignificant result, there is always concern
over publication bias [53], which would skew the results
towards desirable and more statistically significant out-
comes. Moving forward with Nudge Theory research,
the field would benefit from reporting of all experimen-
tation, whether its results are successful, unsuccessful,
significant, or insignificant.
Suggestions for future research
As described in the results section, included papers were
exclusively from high-income countries (HICs) and from
the United States in particular. Though these results
provide a good theoretical framework for future work in
other HICs, it is difficult to confidently ascertain the via-
bility of these interventions in a low or middle-income
country setting. Therefore, researchers should begin to
conduct similar studies in more diverse country settings.

 By obtaining these results, the ability to extrapolate gen-
eral policy themes from data will be strengthened.
While this review retrieved substantial data, our ana-
lyses would be strengthened by further availability of ex-
periment results. The literature would benefit from
repetition of nudges with demonstrated success at a
broader, more population-based, level.
The research reported here focused on generally
healthy male and female adults, as described in the
methodology section and participant criteria. Due to the
frequent reporting of different eating restraint scores be-
tween men and women [39, 45], it was chosen to focus
only on mixed groups, but a worthwhile future venture
would be to examine these same results as they are

 different between the sexes. It could be useful for
policy makers to be aware of these discrepancies, and
to examine the best intervention for each of them
independently if nudges are to be considered in any
gender-specific settings. At a minimum, such a review
could confirm the results found for the general popu-
lation for each group independently. These results
could allow policy-makers to better tailor nudge ap-
proaches to specific settings.
Finally, a crucial step in future research will be to
perform sub-group analyses on the results reported
here and any additional studies that become available.
These analyses could include differentiating results
among different targeted populations to determine the
best strategy for particular target groups, as men-
tioned above. They should certainly include a tax-
onomy of Nudge strategies and individual analysis for
each of them, to determine if a particular method is
better or worse than others. This would add benefit
for health policy makers to be certain they are spend-
ing resources in the most effective ways.
Conclusions
The results of this review and meta-analysis demon-
strate that Nudge Theory strategies provide an effect-
ive and viable public health strategy in encouraging
healthier eating choices in adults. As governments
and policy-making bodies continue to consider the
use of Nudge, it is essential they draw on strong evi-
dence for its effectiveness. This work provides some
of the first meta-analysis results to contribute to this
required evidence base. It also clarifies some of the
gaps in the current Nudge literature, highlighting
where more research is needed to further strengthen
the available evidence base.
