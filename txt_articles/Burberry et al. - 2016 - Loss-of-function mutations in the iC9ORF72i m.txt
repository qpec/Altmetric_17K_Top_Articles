C9ORF72 mutations are found in a significant fraction of patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
and frontotemporal dementia, yet the function of the C9ORF72 gene product remains poorly understood. We
show that mice harboring loss-of-function mutations in the ortholog of C9ORF72 develop splenomegaly, neu-
trophilia, thrombocytopenia, increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, and severe autoimmunity, ultimately
leading to a high mortality rate. Transplantation of mutant mouse bone marrow into wild-type recipients was suf-
ficient to recapitulate the phenotypes observed in the mutant animals, including autoimmunity and premature
mortality. Reciprocally, transplantation of wild-type mouse bone marrow into mutant mice improved their pheno-
type. We conclude that C9ORF72 serves an important function within the hematopoietic system to restrict inflam-
mation and the development of autoimmunity.
INTRODUCTION
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by the progressive
degeneration of motor neurons, resulting in paralysis and death (1).
Genetic findings suggest that ALS can result from mutations in genes
acting in several cellular processes (2). To date, the most common
mutation found in ALS patients, as well as in frontotemporal demen-
tia (FTD), is a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the first intron of
C9ORF72 (3). This mutation is present in 4 to 8% of patients with spo-
radic ALS (4). The repeat expansion is also found in 40% of familial ALS
cases from Europe and the United States and is even more prevalent
in Scandinavia (3, 4). Identification of unaffected elderly carriers sug-
gests that the mutation’s effects are incompletely penetrant (5).
The expanded GGGGCC repeat in C9ORF72 has been proposed
to mediate its effects through one mechanism or a combination of
three mechanisms: the creation of long repetitive RNAs (3, 6), the
translation of these RNAs into toxic repetitive dipeptides (7), or the
silencing of the mutant allele (3, 8, 9). Histological and gene expres-
sion studies indicate that all three effects of the repeat expansion man-
ifest themselves in individuals harboring it. However, determining
which effect or effects of the mutation contribute to the degenerative
phenotypes seen in patients remains unresolved. The normal protein
product of C9ORF72 contains a DENN domain (10) and may act as
a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (11). Previous studies in fish
and worms suggested that C9ORF72 might function in the nervous sys-
tem (8, 12). We found that although the murine ortholog of C9ORF72
(3110043O21Rik, hereafter referred to as C9orf72) is widely expressed, it
was enriched in motor neurons known to degenerate in ALS (13). How-
ever, a recent study demonstrated that conditional excision of C9orf72
in cells of the nervous system had no overt effects, raising the question
of whether it plays any role in the nervous system or overall health (14).
Resolving the function of the endogenous C9ORF72 gene product
remains important because it could provide insight into whether the
reduction in gene product found in patients with the repeat expansion
contributes to their disease (3, 8, 9). Furthermore, efforts are proceed-
ing to develop therapeutic approaches for knocking down the gain-of-
function products of the repeat expansion (9). Because knockdown
strategies could inadvertently depress transcription of the normal gene
product, it will be critical to understand the phenotypic ramifications
of long-term depression of gene expression from this locus.
Here, we report an initial study of mice harboring loss-of-function
mutations in C9orf72. We found that homozygous mutant animals
produced through homologous recombination, as well as CRISPR (clus-
tered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 targeting,
developed several classical features of autoimmunity. Transplantation
studies demonstrated that mutant bone marrow cells were sufficient
to cause autoimmunity and premature mortality when placed into other-
wise wild-type recipients. Thus, we conclude that the gene product
encoded by C9orf72 likely acts within the hematopoietic system to
play an important role in the promotion of immunological tolerance.
RESULTS
C9orf72 loss-of-function mutations cause premature mortality
We recently identified the mouse ortholog of C9ORF72 and generated
heterozygous mice harboring a LacZ insertion replacing exons 2 to 6
of the gene on an inbred C57BL/6 background (13) (Fig. 1A). Because
this targeting event eliminated highly conserved 5′ exons of C9orf72,
we reasoned that it might result in a loss of gene function, allowing the
importance of this gene to be investigated. After intercrossing hetero-
zygous (+/−) animals, we found that mice of the three expected geno-
types were recovered at expected Mendelian frequencies (Fig. 1B). We
designated this strain “KOMP” because the gene targeting to create

 this allele was originally performed by the Knock Out Mouse Project
(KOMP) Consortium.
We next sought to use animals from the +/− intercrosses to deter-
mine whether the targeted mutation reduced expression of C9orf72.
Using exon-spanning primers, we detected a significant, dose-dependent
reduction in the abundance of transcript sequences from exons 6
through 8 in whole blood of +/− and −/− animals relative to that found
in wild-type controls (Fig. 1C; **P < 0.01). To assess whether the mu-
tation also resulted in decreased protein
levels, we used two anti-C9orf72 antibodies,
one raised against C-terminal regions of the
protein and the other against its N termi-
nus. In each case, a band with the predicted
mass of C9orf72 was significantly depleted
in mutant animals (Fig. 1, D and E; *P <
0.05, **P < 0.01).
There are historical examples of the
transcriptional units encoding drug re-
sistance used in gene targeting leading
to off-target phenotypes (15). We there-
fore removed the selection cassette used
for gene targeting by outcrossing C9orf72-
targeted KOMP mice with outbred ani-
mals that expressed the Cre recombinase
under the control of the Sox2 promoter
(16) (hereafter referred to as “Neo-deleted”)
(Fig. 1A and fig. S1A). Intercrosses of +/−
Neo-deleted animals resulted in recovery
of +/+, +/−, and −/− animals at the ex-
pected Mendelian frequencies (Fig. 1F).
Neo-deleted +/− and −/− mice exhibited
a significant and dose-dependent reduction
in C9orf72 transcript abundance (Fig. 1G;
**P < 0.01). Because proper interpretation
of mouse models relies on the fidelity of
the genetic modifications introduced, we
performed whole-genome sequencing of
representative +/+, +/−, and −/− KOMP
animals, as well as −/− Neo-deleted mice.
These studies revealed proper gene target-
ing in each strain and the absence of off-
target insertions (fig. S1B). We were also
able to confirm the C57BL/6 inbred nature
of KOMP animals and outbred nature of
Neo-deleted animals (fig. S1, C to F).
To determine the effects of C9orf72 loss
of function, we intercrossed +/− KOMP ani-
mals and monitored littermates for 400 days
(Fig. 2A; n = 163; +/+, n = 50; +/−, n =
84; −/−, n = 29). At 70 days of age, we
noted no obvious phenotypes (Fig. 2A).
However, as the cohort continued to age,
the risk of death in both −/− and +/− ani-
mals grew to a high level of significance
(Fig. 2A; *P < 0.05). We also examined
Neo-deleted mice generated by +/− inter-
crosses (Fig. 2B; n = 50; +/+, n = 15; +/−,
n = 21; −/−, n = 14). At later ages, we sim-
ilarly observed significantly increased mortality in +/− and −/− mice
(Fig. 2B; *P < 0.05). Because C9orf72 has been genetically implicated
in ALS, we asked whether increased mortality in mutant animals was
associated with neural degeneration. However, we did not find obvi-
ous changes in the number of spinal motor neurons (fig. S2). Nor did
we observe differences in the gross histology of the mutant motor cor-
tex (fig. S3) or other brain regions of mutant animals (fig. S4). We did,
however, observe evidence for increased neural inflammation in the

 cortex of mutant animals as evidenced by focal staining with anti–
GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) antibodies (fig. S5).
We next sought to establish the onset of decline in these mutant
animals, to quantify the duration of their decline, and to better under-
stand the causes of their premature death. We weighed mice weekly
and performed necropsy on animals found dead or that we were
obliged to euthanize because of preestablished animal welfare criteria.
We noted that although animals of all genotypes initially exhibited
similar weights, as they aged, the weight
of both KOMP and Neo-deleted −/− ani-
mals plateaued and became significantly
lower than that of wild-type controls
(Fig. 2, C and D; *P < 0.05). By defining
phenotypic onset for each animal as the
age at which it reached its maximum
body weight, we were then able to quan-
tify the number of days that a given
animal was burdened by decline before
its death. Heterozygous animals were bur-
dened by decline for, on average, 118 ±
67 days (KOMP; n = 13) and 56 ± 38 days
(Neo-deleted; n = 10), whereas −/− animals
were burdened by decline for, on average,
76 ± 51 days (KOMP; n = 21) and 37 ±
29 days (Neo-deleted; n = 9) (Fig. 2E). Dur-
ing these studies, we determined that the
causes of demise included cachexia, respira-
tory failure, hepatomegaly, dermatitis, inter-
nal hemorrhage, lymphocytic stromal cell
hyperplasia, severe ataxia, and prolapse
(Fig. 2E and fig. S6).
Upon necropsy of end-stage animals,
we observed enlarged spleens in KOMP
−/− (n = 10 of 11) and Neo-deleted −/−
(n = 6 of 6) mice (Fig. 3, A and B). Spleno-
megaly can result from any one of several
underlying pathologies, including infection,
myeloproliferative disease, chronic lympho-
cytic leukemia, lymphoma, and auto-
immunity. To investigate whether any of
these was the cause of splenomegaly in
mutant animals, we visually inspected
day 300 spleens from Neo-deleted animals
(+/+, n = 6; +/−, n = 3; −/−, n = 7) and
then subjected them to histological analy-
sis. We observed a clear demarcation be-
tween red and white pulp regions in +/+
and +/− spleens, whereas −/− spleens dis-
played a disruption of red and white pulp
boundaries (Fig. 3B). We next asked when
splenomegaly first appeared in these ani-
mals. We found that day 25 Neo-deleted
−/− animals exhibited normal spleen sizes,
whereas day 50 −/− animals had developed
significantly enlarged spleens relative to
their littermates (Fig. 3D; **P < 0.01). This
significant increase in spleen weight was
maintained in day 100, day 200, and day
300 −/− animals (Fig. 3D; **P < 0.01). We reasoned that splenic vein
thrombosis and spontaneous microbial infection were less likely causes
of splenomegaly in −/− animals because of the synchronicity and pen-
etrance at which this phenotype developed.
We next considered the possibility that splenomegaly was the re-
sult of lymphoma. In lymphoma, individual clonal populations of
either B or T cells can dominate the splenic compartment. How-
ever, mutant animals displayed an increase in splenocytes derived

 from several lineages, including CD19+ B220+ B cells, CD3+ CD4+
T cells, and CD11b+ Ly6G+ neutrophils (Fig. 3, E and F, and fig. S7; *P <
0.05, **P < 0.01). Furthermore, analysis of V(D)J recombination in
spleens of mutant animals (17) revealed polyclonal populations of B
and T cells, arguing against the type of clo-
nal expansion observed in lymphoma (Fig.
3G). We also did not observe histological
changes in the cellularity of −/− bone mar-
row (fig. S8), which can be a site of lym-
phocytic transformation (18).
In addition to the nearly ubiquitous
splenomegaly observed in −/− animals, we
also noted that a subset of end-stage
KOMP −/− (n = 4 of 21) and Neo-deleted
−/− (n = 3 of 9) animals developed grossly
enlarged cervical lymph nodes (fig. S9).
Enlarged lymph nodes can result from
inflammation, lymphoma, autoimmunity,
or an inability of lymphocytes to escape this
compartment (19, 20). Although we noted
modest changes in the relative proportion
of B and T cells, both of these populations
were greatly expanded within enlarged
cervical lymph nodes of mutant animals
(fig. S9), again arguing against clonal
transformation as an explanation. Instead,
we observed an increase in T cell activa-
tion state, with a significant reduction in
CD62Lhi CD44lo cells and a significant in-
crease in CD62Lhi CD44hi and CD62Llo
CD44hi cells when compared to controls
(fig. S9; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01).
Finally, we noted that a small but
significant subset of both KOMP and
Neo-deleted mutant animals developed
hepatomegaly (Fig. 2E and fig. S10). His-
tological analysis suggested that this liver
overgrowth was likely the result of im-
mune cell infiltration (fig. S10). Such im-
mune infiltrates in liver can be seen in the
context of both leukemia and autoimmu-
nity (21). In this case, infiltrating hemato-
poietic cells appeared morphologically
diverse, rather than clonal in nature, which
again seemed less parsimonious with the
diagnosis of leukemia and more consistent
with chronic inflammation (fig. S10).
Changes in peripheral blood
were consistent with autoimmunity
not leukemia
Assessing the composition of peripheral
blood can yield insight into pathways that
disrupt the hematopoietic system. We there-
fore performed whole blood cell counts
on mutant mice greater than 300 days
of age (Fig. 4, A to H). Numbers of white
blood cells, platelets, and RBCs in
KOMP +/+ and Neo-deleted +/+ animals were similar to historic
ranges in inbred mouse strains (22). In contrast, total white blood cell
counts were modestly but significantly elevated in KOMP −/− and Neo-
deleted −/− mice (Fig. 4A; **P < 0.01), which was due to a significant

 increase in the number of circulating neutrophils (Fig. 4B; **P < 0.01).
We observed no significant changes in the relative proportion of
peripheral lymphocytes (Fig. 5C) or monocytes in mice of differing
genotypes (Fig. 4D).
We also noted that platelet count was significantly reduced in
KOMP −/− and Neo-deleted −/− animals (Fig. 4E; **P < 0.01) and that
there was a modest but significant reduction of RBCs in KOMP −/− and
Neo-deleted −/− (Fig. 4F; **P < 0.01) animals that was accompanied by a
modest but significant reduction in hematocrit (Fig. 4G; **P < 0.01).
Mean corpuscular volume was also reduced in KOMP −/− and Neo-
deleted −/− animals (Fig. 4H; **P < 0.01), consistent with modest micro-
cytic anemia. Although there can be many causes for changes in red cell
and platelet counts, similar phenotypes are seen in autoimmune hemo-
lytic anemia and thrombocytopenic purpura, in which RBCs or platelets,
respectively, are targeted by autoantibodies, leading to their destruction (23).
To understand how changes in the peripheral blood developed, we
bled Neo-deleted animals (n = 163) ranging from 50 to 200 days of
age (Fig. 4, I to K; +/+, n = 49; +/−, n = 65; −/−, n = 49). We noted
that platelet count was already reduced by day 50 in −/− mice and was
persistently depressed in older animals
(Fig. 4K; *P < 0.05). Although young ani-
mals displayed normal neutrophil and
white cell numbers, at 100 days of age,
−/− mice began to exhibit a persistent
and significant increase in neutrophil num-
bers (Fig. 4J; **P < 0.01), which was the
primary contributor to a significant in-
crease in total white cell counts (Fig. 4I;
*P < 0.05). In contrast, numbers of lym-
phocytes in the blood remained unchanged
relative to wild-type controls. Thus, neutro-
philia, thrombocytopenia, and splenomegaly
were highly penetrant phenotypes, which
all developed between days 50 and 100 in
−/− animals, suggesting an interconnected
pathological relationship. In contrast, en-
larged lymph nodes and immune cell infil-
trates in the liver were observed later and at
lower frequencies in mutant animals, sug-
gesting that they could be secondary ef-
fects of changes to the hematopoietic
compartment.
Loss of C9orf72 causes early and
chronic cytokine induction
If the splenic and blood phenotypes that
we observed in −/− animals developed in
response to a chronic inflammatory pro-
cess, we reasoned that their emergence
might be associated with an increased
abundance of inflammatory chemokines
and cytokines. To test this idea, we mea-
sured the levels of 36 chemokines and cy-
tokines in plasma from day 300 KOMP
(Fig. 5A; +/+, n = 18; +/−, n = 8; −/−,
n = 11) and Neo-deleted animals (Fig. 5B;
+/+, n = 3; +/−, n = 11; −/−, n = 4). Eigh-
teen of 36 cytokines and chemokines were
significantly elevated in both KOMP −/− and Neo-deleted −/− animals
relative to +/+ controls, including IL-22 (interleukin-22), IL-28, IL-23,
IL-6, MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1), IL-31, IL-5, IL-10,
IL-1b, IL-15/IL-15R (IL-15 receptor), IFN-g (interferon-g), IL-3, GM-
CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor), IL-17A,
IFN-a, MIP-1B (macrophage inflammatory protein-1B), LIF (leukemia
inhibitory factor), and GROa (growth-related oncogene a) (Fig. 5, A
and B; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01). No cytokines or chemokines were signif-
icantly changed in KOMP +/− mice relative to controls (Fig. 5A), al-
though we did note that IL-28 was significantly elevated and IL-2 was
significantly reduced in +/− Neo-deleted animals relative to controls
(Fig. 5B; *P < 0.05). We next analyzed cytokine levels in cohorts of mice
at earlier time points. We found that already at 50 days of age, IL-31,
IL-15/IL-15R, and GM-CSF were significantly elevated in Neo-deleted
−/− mice relative to wild-type mice (fig. S11; *P < 0.05). By 100 days of
age, Neo-deleted −/− animals displayed significantly increased levels of
19 of 36 cytokines and chemokines tested, fully recapitulating the pat-
tern observed in older animals at both days 200 and 300 (fig. S11; *P <
0.05, **P < 0.01). Thus, the development of an inflammatory cytokine

 profile was an early event in mutant animals that either preceded or
was coincident with other blood phenotypes and a decline in health.
Mutant animals rapidly develop persistent autoimmunity
We next considered the possibility that the changes in cytokine levels
that we found were due to autoimmunity. Autoantibodies targeting
double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) are a common diagnostic marker
of autoimmune syndromes, including systemic lupus erythematosus
(24). We found significant accumulation
of anti-dsDNA antibody activity between
50 and 100 days of age in Neo-deleted
−/− animals (Fig. 5D; **P < 0.01), which
was sustained in plasma from KOMP
−/− and Neo-deleted −/− animals greater
than 300 days of age (Fig. 5C; *P < 0.05,
**P < 0.01).
Although the accumulation of anti-
dsDNA antibodies occurs under con-
ditions of autoimmunity, it can also be
indicative of rapid but transient cell death
(25). To distinguish between these two
possibilities, we used established auto-
antigen microarrays to test the plasma
of day 300 Neo-deleted littermates for
the presence and abundance of immuno-
globulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies tar-
geting 124 autoantigens from disparate
cell types (26) (Fig. 5, E and F). In −/−
plasma, IgM autoantibodies targeting
117 of 124 antigens were significantly ele-
vated relative to controls. Similarly, IgG
autoantibodies targeting 113 of 124 anti-
gens were significantly elevated in −/−
animals (table S1; *P < 0.05). In +/− plas-
ma, IgM autoantibodies targeting 1 of
124 antigens [liver kidney microsomal
type 1 (LKM1)] were significantly ele-
vated and IgG autoantibodies targeting
2 of 124 antigens (Collagen II and Mi-2)
were significantly elevated relative to con-
trols (table S1; *P < 0.05). Hierarchical
clustering revealed that the pattern of
IgM autoantibody activity in five of six
−/− animals was significantly distinct from
+/+ controls and two of four +/− animals
(Fig. 5E). Intriguingly, the other two of four
+/− animals displayed an intermediate pat-
tern of IgM autoantibody reactivity, clus-
tering with the remaining −/− mice (Fig.
5E). Clustering based on IgG-recognized
autoantigens placed all mutants in one dis-
tinct group, with no obvious distinction be-
tween +/− and +/+ found in this case (Fig.
5F). Thus, we conclude that loss of C9orf72
results in the accumulation of a wide array
of self-reactive antibodies, which is indica-
tive of an autoimmune phenotype.
Because T regulatory cells restrict in-
flammation, we measured the percentage of CD25+ CD4+ cells, which
are enriched for this T cell subtype, in spleens from 400-day-old Neo-
deleted animals and found that CD25+ CD4+ cells were significantly
elevated in −/− spleens relative to +/+ animals (fig. S12; **P < 0.01).
C9orf72 promotes tolerance in the immune system

ortholog are expressed in blood cells. We therefore asked whether

 C9orf72 acts within the hematopoietic
compartment. To address this, we per-
formed bone marrow transplantation
(BMT) between animals of distinct geno-
types. Because of their inbred nature, we
performed reciprocal BMT experiments
using KOMP mice. To serve as pheno-
typic negative and positive controls, we
transplanted −/− bone marrow into −/−
recipients (−/−→−/−) (n = 6) and +/+
marrow into +/+ recipients (WT→WT)
(Fig. 6A). To test whether a −/− geno-
type in bone marrow–derived cells was
sufficient to cause autoimmunity, we trans-
planted −/− bone marrow into +/+ recipi-
ents (−/−→WT) (n = 12). Reciprocally,
we asked whether loss of C9orf72 in the
blood was necessary for the develop-
ment of autoimmunity by attempting
to ameliorate the phenotype of −/− ani-
mals with transplantation of +/+ marrow
(WT→−/−) (n = 7). B6.SJL-PtprcaPepcb/
BoyJ mice were used as wild-type bone
marrow donors and recipients to facili-
tate tracking of reconstitution efficiency
(Fig. 6A). No animals perished imme-
diately after BMT. By 17 weeks, 29 of
30 transplanted animals exhibited >90%
reconstitution of CD45+ cells, including
CD11b+ Ly6G− monocytes, CD11b+ Ly6G+
neutrophils, and B220+ B cells (Fig. 6, B
and C, and fig. S13), indicating that en-
graftment of donor hematopoietic cells
was efficient and sustained. However, we
did note that CD3+ T cell reconstitution
was incomplete, ranging from 40 to 80%
donor-derived cells (Fig. 6, B and C, and
fig. S13), which can be observed because
of the relative radio resistance and long-
lived nature of this cell type (28).
All WT→WT animals survived be-
yond 460 days of age (Fig. 6D) and pro-
gressively gained weight (Fig. 6E). In line
with our previous findings (Fig. 2), we not-
ed that mice lacking C9orf72 (−/−→−/−)
failed to gain weight as fast as their wild-
type (WT→WT) counterparts, a differ-
ence that became significant by 174 days
of age (Fig. 7E; *P < 0.05). Moreover, all
−/−→−/− animals (n = 6 of 6) died by
350 days, with a median survival of
293 days (Fig. 6D; *P < 0.05), and the
causes of death or obligatory euthanasia
in −/−→−/− animals were consistent
with those observed previously (Fig. 2E,
fig. S13, and video 1). At end stage,
−/−→−/− mice had developed spleno-
megaly (Fig. 6F; **P < 0.01), neutrophilia

 (Fig. 6G; **P < 0.01), thrombocytopenia
(Fig. 6H; **P < 0.01), and anemia (Fig. 6I;
**P < 0.01). Anti-dsDNA antibody activ-
ity was significantly elevated in −/−→−/−
at an age that preceded mortality (day
230) (Fig. 6J; **P < 0.01), as well as at
end stage (Fig. 6K; **P < 0.01). Thus, le-
thal irradiation and BMT did not affect
the development of autoimmunity in
−/− animals.
We asked which of the phenotypes
found in −/− animals could be observed
in +/+ animals receiving −/− bone marrow.
We found that −/−→WT animals were
significantly smaller than WT→WT ani-
mals at 206 days of age, after which their
body weight plateaued (Fig. 6E; *P < 0.05).
Strikingly, 9 of 12 −/−→WT mice died by
460 days of age with a median survival of
443 days (Fig. 6D; *P < 0.05 relative to
WT→WT; video 2). At end stage, all
−/−→WT (n = 9 of 9) had larger spleens
(Fig. 6F; **P < 0.01), whereas a subset of
−/−→WT mice (3 of 12) had developed
enlarged cervical lymph nodes (fig. S13).
Relative to WT→WT mice, −/−→WT
animals had similar numbers of neutro-
phils (Fig. 6G) but displayed a signifi-
cantly lower platelet count (Fig. 6H; **P <
0.01) and had significantly reduced he-
matocrit (Fig. 6I; **P < 0.01). IL-22, IL-31,
and MIP-1B were significantly ele-
vated in −/−→WT animals relative to
WT→WT at end stage (fig. S13; *P <
0.05). Anti-dsDNA antibody activity was
similar in −/−→WT and WT→WT ani-
mals at day 230 (Fig. 6J), yet by end stage,
−/−→WT displayed significantly elevated
anti-dsDNA antibody activity (Fig. 6K;
*P < 0.05).
Next, we asked whether transplanta-
tion of WT bone marrow into −/− ani-
mals could improve their phenotype. By
230 days of age, WT→−/− mice had
gained more weight than their −/−→−/−
counterparts (Fig. 6E; *P < 0.05). Moreover,
WT→−/− animals lived significantly longer
than −/−→−/− animals, with the longest
lived WT→−/− animals surviving to
452 days of age and with a median sur-
vival of 340 days, representing a 43-day
extension of life span (Fig. 6D; *P < 0.05
relative to −/−→−/−; video 3). Splenomegaly
was apparent in all WT→−/− animals at
end stage, but on average, their spleens
were smaller than −/−→−/− mice (Fig.
6F; **P < 0.01). Relative to −/−→−/− ani-
mals, WT→−/− mice had significantly

C9orf72 mutant mice generated by CRISPR/Cas9
develop autoimmunity
We noted that some noncoding regions within the deleted locus showed
a degree of conservation that raised the possibility that their disruption
could contribute to the phenotypes observed in KOMP and Neo-deleted
animals. To rule out this possibility, we used CRISPR/Cas9 technology
to induce deletion mutations in exon 4 of C9orf72 (Fig. 7A), an exon pres-
ent in all transcribed isoforms of both human and murine orthologs.
Next-generation sequencing of PCR amplicons spanning the target site
revealed disruption of C9orf72 exon 4 in 23 of 24 CRISPR/Cas9-targeted
mice (Fig. 7B, fig. S14, and table S2). In 11 of 24 CRISPR/Cas9-targeted
animals, we identified only premature stop codon mutations and no wild-
type sequences, suggesting that these mice were compound heterozygous
loss-of-function mutants for C9orf72 (Fig. 7B, fig. S14, and table S2).
All CRISPR/Cas9-targeted mice survived to adulthood, yet as they aged,
their propensity to die increased, with only 10 of 24 animals surviving be-
yond 500 days of age (Fig. 7C). Splenomegaly was apparent in all mice (n =
7 of 7) necropsied (Fig. 7, D and E), whereas protrusions in the neck area
indicative of enlarged cervical lymph nodes were apparent in 3 of
24 animals (fig. S14). Analysis of blood from mutant mice at day 310
revealed a significant reduction in hematocrit (Fig. 7F; **P < 0.01) and a
significant increase in anti-dsDNA antibody activity (Fig. 7G; *P < 0.05).
Because CRISPR/Cas9-targeted animals were mosaic for mutations
in C9orf72, we crossed F0 mice with C57BL/6 to isolate F1 progeny
harboring one wild-type allele and one mutated allele (fig. S14). We
then interbred F1 progeny containing a 38-nucleotide deletion in
C9orf72 exon 4, predicted to generate a premature stop codon after
183 amino acids, to generate animals that were wild-type (+/+), het-
erozygous (+/del), and homozygous (del/del) for this particular muta-
tion (Fig. 7H and fig. S14). We again found that C9orf72 del/del F2
mutants displayed significantly elevated anti-dsDNA antibody activity
by day 150 (Fig. 7I; **P < 0.01).
DISCUSSION
Here, we report that eliminating function of mouse C9orf72 predis-
poses animals to fatal immune defects and autoimmunity. We observed
that these classic features of autoimmunity (24, 29) developed synchro-
nously, well before the onset of premature mortality. Furthermore,
heterozygous animals were more susceptible than control mice to the
generation of a limited repertoire of autoantibodies and were at in-
creased risk of early mortality. Chronic inflammation is a known con-
tributor to most, if not all, of the causes of death that we observed in
+/− and −/− animals. Notably, the pattern of inflammatory cytokines
chronically up-regulated in −/− animals included several members of
the IL-23/IL-17 immune axis, which plays a pathogenic role in rheuma-
toid arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn disease, and multiple sclerosis (30).
Our findings led us to posit that C9orf72 serves an important func-
tion in the hematopoietic system. This hypothesis was substantiated
by transplant studies in which mutant bone marrow transferred auto-
immune phenotypes to wild-type recipients and wild-type bone marrow
suppressed immune deregulation and significantly extended life span in
mutant animals. However, although the phenotype of mutant animals
that received wild-type marrow was improved relative to mutant mice
receiving mutant bone marrow, their phenotype was still substantially
worse than wild-type animals receiving wild-type bone marrow. Fail-
ure of wild-type bone marrow to completely rescue mutant mice leaves
open the possibility that C9orf72 also functions in a radiation-resistant cell
population, such as microglia, which are peripheral antigen-presenting
cells, the dysfunction of which could lead to improper priming of adap-
tive immune responses. C9orf72 might also function in the thymic ep-
ithelium, which is critical for the establishment of peripheral tolerance.
Alternatively, T cells themselves are well-known modulators of immu-
nity, and the incomplete replacement of this compartment after trans-
plantation provides another potential explanation for the incomplete
rescue observed. Our findings, and those that indicate that T cell
function becomes compromised in mice harboring mutations in ad-
ditional ALS-implicated genes (19, 31), suggest that investigating
whether C9orf72 functions in this cell type is warranted. Although
we observed an increase in the abundance of CD25+ CD4+ cells, which
are enriched for T regulatory cells, in the spleens of mutant animals,
whether mutant T regulatory cells harbor functional deficits that con-
tribute to the phenotypes that we observed remains to be determined.
Elevation of T regulatory cells could represent a compensatory reac-
tion to the reduced functionality of this cellular subset or a homeostatic
response to persistent inflammation.
We note that our study does have certain limitations and leaves sev-
eral questions unresolved. Although our studies demonstrate that bone
marrow cells play a role in the phenotypes that we observed and suggest
that C9orf72 functions in hematopoietic derivatives of the bone marrow,
we cannot rule out the possibility that C9orf72 acts through marrow-
resident mesenchymal cells. Additionally, we did not perform an ex-
haustive census of transplanted animals to monitor the extent of
engraftment into solid tissues, including the brain. Therefore, we can-
not address whether incomplete imposition or rescue of mutant pheno-
types after transplant might be due to variable infiltration of cells into
a given solid organ (32) rather than due to the function of C9orf72 in
nonhematopoietic cell types. In the future, it will be important to resolve
the identity of the specific cell types in which C9orf72 functions to pre-
serve a normal immune response. We previously showed that C9orf72
was highly expressed in neuronal cell types that are most sensitive to cell
death in ALS and FTD but is more modestly expressed in microglia. De-
spite the high level of C9orf72 expression in the neuronal lineage, the data
we report here suggest that this gene acts through bone marrow–derived
cells in which it is expressed. It remains to be determined whether
C9orf72 serves some nonessential function in neurons that express it.
Recently, haploinsufficiency for TBK1, a kinase functioning in IFN
signaling and selective autophagy (33), has been shown to cause ALS and
FTD [reviewed in (34)]. Tbk1 −/− mice display an embryonic lethal phe-
notype; however, deletion of this gene on an outbred background leads to
monocytosis, splenomegaly, and infiltration of immune cells into the skin,
lung, liver, and kidneys (35). Cre-mediated ablation of Tbk1 in T cells re-
sulted in their activation and overaccumulation in the spleen and lymph
nodes (19). These phenotypic commonalities observed upon loss of Tbk1
and C9orf72 are striking. Whether these gene products act in a common path-
way requires further investigation; however, it is notable that at least one
report has suggested that C9ORF72 may also function in autophagy (11).

 Whether malfunctions in the immune system directly contribute to
degenerative phenotypes in ALS patients remains unresolved (36, 37).
Studies have identified infiltrating T cells and hyperactivation of resident
immune cells in the postmortem spinal cords of ALS patients (38, 39).
Patients with a rapid course of disease were also found to have fewer
circulating T regulatory cells than did individuals with slower disease pro-
gression (40), and levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-17 and
IL-23 were found to be elevated in plasma and cerebral spinal fluid from
at least one ALS cohort (41). Recently, a large epidemiologic study found
substantially higher rates of autoimmune history in patients eventually
developing ALS (42). However, studies of autoantibodies in ALS patients
have been mixed, with some finding evidence of their presence, whereas
others have not (36, 37). The ever-improving understanding of the genet-
ic contributors to ALS suggests that revisiting immune phenotypes in
patients who have been stratified by C9ORF72, TBK1, and other geno-
types could now be warranted.
There are several other phenotypic studies of C9orf72-deficient mice
(43, 44). These reports provide direct confirmation of our finding that
C9orf72 mutant animals develop splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy.
Furthermore, Atanasio and colleagues found, as we report here, that mu-
tant animals exhibited elevated plasma cytokines and autoantibodies (43).
However, there were a number of differences between our findings and
these recent studies that warrant future resolution. Most notably, although
both we and O’Rourke et al. generated C9orf72 mutant animals using the
same targeting vector generated by the KOMP Consortium, heterozygous
and homozygous mutants in our colony displayed an increased risk of
mortality whereas mutants in their colony did not. This discrepancy sug-
gests that either environmental factors or differences in genetic back-
ground may influence the longevity of mice lacking C9orf72, as is the
case with other models of autoimmunity (29). Additionally, both Atanasio
et al. and O’Rourke et al. found an increase in macrophage number in
mutant animals and suggested that inflammatory phenotypes found in
these mice may be due to dysfunction in this or other phagocytic cell
types. Our conclusion that C9orf72 functions in bone marrow–derived
cells is consistent with this idea. However, we also observed a much
broader proliferative disorder affecting both myeloid and lymphoid
lineages, leaving open the question of whether this gene may act in addi-
tional hematopoietic cell types. In the future, conditional ablation of
C9orf72 in specific blood lineages should address where precisely this gene
functions to suppress pathological inflammation.
Overall, our findings have implications for planned therapeutic in-
terventions in ALS patients harboring the C9ORF72 repeat expansion.
Regardless of whether loss of function in C9ORF72 plays a central role
in the development of ALS, our experiments do strongly suggest that
therapeutic efforts to reduce expression of the repeat expansion, such
as with antisense oligonucleotides (9), should be designed and carried
out with caution. If not, chronic depression of the limited quantity of
normal gene product that still remains in these ALS patients could
occur, potentially resulting in autoimmunity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The goal of this study was to characterize the consequences of C9orf72
loss-of-function mutations in mice. The experimental design involved
long-term survival studies paired with age-matched and genotype-
matched histologic, cellular, and biofluidic analysis. Predefined end-
point criteria included greater than 15% loss of body weight, signs of
distressed breathing, enlarged abdomen, severe dermatitis, lymph nodes
greater than 15 mm that inhibited mobility, inability of the mouse to right
itself, or severe prolapse. Exploratory experiments were performed in ex-
cess of five mice per genotype. Sample sizes for BMT studies were
calculated using G-power analysis based on previously defined effect sizes.
Donor and recipient mice were randomized into treatment groups, and all
outliers were included in data analysis. All experimental protocols and pro-
cedures were approved by the Animal Committee of Harvard University.
RNA extraction and quantitative PCR
Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Gibco). First-strand complementary
DNA was synthesized using iScript (Bio-Rad). C9orf72 transcript abun-
dance was analyzed using SYBR Green on CFX96 Real-Time System
(ABI). C9orf72 exon 6 to 8 primers are as follows: 5′-GCAGTGCAGAG-
AAAGTAAATAAGATAG-3′ and5′-ACTGCCTGTTGCATCCTTTAG-3′.
Fixation, sectioning, and tissue staining
Mice were anesthetized with Avertin and perfused with phosphate-
buffered saline and then with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Tissues
were harvested and postfixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4°C. Tissue
was dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 6 mm, and stained
for hematoxylin and eosin. Sections were examined in a blinded manner
and imaged using Zeiss AX10.
Western blotting
Total protein was extracted from a frozen brain with a reducing sam-
ple buffer (radioimmunoprecipitation assay) containing complete in-
hibitor cocktail (Roche). Protein (15 mg) was separated on 4 to 20%
SDS–polyacrylamide gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride
membrane, blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin, incubated with
primary antibodies [anti–C9ORF72–N-terminal (Proteintech), anti–
C9ORF72–C-terminal (Abgent), and anti–a-tubulin (Abcam)] and
detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Amersham).
Blood and cytokine measures
Peripheral blood was collected via mandible puncture into EDTA-
coated tubes. Blood counts were assessed using a Hemavet (Abaxis)
and then centrifuged to pellet cells, and plasma was harvested from
the supernatant. Luminex-based multiplexed fluorescence assay was
used to assess 36 cytokines and chemokines.
Autoantibody profiling
Plasma was diluted 1:200 and assessed using a mouse a-dsDNA total-
Ig kit (Alpha Diagnostic International). Antibodies against 124 auto-
antigens were measured on autoantigen arrays (26).
Spleen and lymph node fluorescence-activated cell sorting
Spleens were mashed between two glass slides and passed repeatedly
through a 25 5/8G needle to dissociate single cells. After RBC lysis, cells
were quantified using a Countess (Invitrogen). Lymph nodes were pro-
cessed as above without RBC lysis. Cells were stained using the follow-
ing antibodies (BioLegend): B220 (RA3-6B2), CD19 (6D5), k (RMK-45),
l (RML-42), CD11c (N418), CD8a (53-6.7), CD3e (145-2C11), CD4
(GK1.5), CD62L (MEL-14), CD44 (IM7), CD25 (PC61), Pan-NK (DX5),
CD11b (M1/70), Ly6G (1A8), CD115 (AFS98), F4/80 (BM8), and 4′,6-
diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma).

 Bone marrow transplantation
Female B6.SJL-PtprcaPepcb/BoyJ (The Jackson Laboratory) mice were
used as age-matched wild-type bone marrow donors and recipients. Fe-
male KOMP C9orf72 −/− mice were used as age-matched bone marrow
donors and recipients. At D110, marrow from femur and tibias were har-
vested from two wild-type and two −/− donors, flushed, single cell–
dissociated, counted, pooled, and diluted to 5E6 cells/100 ml. Recipient
animals received two rounds of 550 rad separated by 3 hours. 5E6 bone
marrow cells were injected into the tail vein. The recipients were main-
tained on pH 3.0 water for 2 weeks. Reconstitution efficiency in RBC-
lysed peripheral blood at 17 weeks after transplant was measured using
the following antibodies (BioLegend): CD45.2 (104), CD3e (145-2C11),
B220 (RA3-6B2), Ly6G (1A8), CD11b (M1/70), and CD45.1 (A20).
CRISPR/Cas9 sequencing
Tail DNA was PCR-amplified with primers containing flanking adap-
ters, followed by PCR barcoding with 24 unique barcodes. Samples
were pooled, cleaned (Promega Wizard DNA clean-up kit), sequenced
via MiSeq, and analyzed (45).
Statistics
All statistical calculations were performed using GraphPad Prism.
Tests between two groups used two-tailed Student’s t test. Tests be-
tween multiple groups used one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
with Tukey multiple comparisons. Tests between multiple groups over
time used two-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons.
Survival curves were evaluated by generalized Wilcoxon.
