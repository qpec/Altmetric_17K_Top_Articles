Abstract
Purpose—We assessed whether changes in serial multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging 
can help predict the pathological progression of prostate cancer in men on active surveillance.
Materials and Methods—A retrospective cohort study was conducted of 49 consecutive men 
with Gleason 6 prostate cancer who underwent multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging at 
baseline and again more than 6 months later, each followed by a targeted prostate biopsy, between 
January 2011 and May 2015. We evaluated whether progression on multiparametric magnetic 
resonance imaging (an increase in index lesion suspicion score, increase in index lesion volume or 
decrease in index lesion apparent diffusion coefficient) could predict pathological progression 
(Gleason 3 + 4 or greater on subsequent biopsy, in systematic or targeted cores). Diagnostic 
performance of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging was determined with and without 
clinical data using a binary logistic regression model.
Results—The mean interval between baseline and followup multiparametric magnetic resonance 
imaging was 28.3 months (range 11 to 43). Pathological progression occurred in 19 patients 
(39%). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 
multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging was 37%, 90%, 69% and 70%, respectively. Area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.63. A logistic regression model using 
clinical information (maximum cancer core length greater than 3 mm on baseline biopsy or a 
prostate specific antigen density greater than 0.15 ng/ml2 at followup biopsy) had an AUC of 0.87 
for predicting pathological progression. The addition of serial multiparametric magnetic resonance 
imaging data significantly improved the AUC to 0.91 (p = 0.044).

The majority of prostate cancer currently presents as localized disease and nearly half of 
cases are characterized as low grade.1 Thus, active surveillance has become an increasingly 
important management strategy, with the goal of avoiding unnecessary side effects 
associated with definitive therapy without missing the window for curative treatment, if 
necessary.
Serial prostate biopsy is a critical component of most contemporary AS regimens.2 The 
current standard of care is systematic, extended, sextant, 12-core transrectal ultrasound 
guided biopsy (systematic biopsy) which does not target specific lesions and, therefore, may 
under sample clinically significant disease.3 There is an unmet need for better noninvasive 
monitoring of men with PCa.
Multiparametric MRI provides a noninvasive means to assess the entire prostate gland from 
an anatomical and functional perspective. Findings on mpMRI are significant predictors of 
subsequent biopsy results.4,5 Therefore, mpMRI may be a useful adjunct in the followup of 
men on AS through detecting disease progression and through directing subsequent targeted 
biopsy. The value of mpMRI in the initial selection of men for AS is well established but the 
usefulness of serial mpMRI in the followup of men on AS has not yet been confirmed.6
Before serial mpMRI can be incorporated into AS regimens in a meaningful way, the 2 key 
questions that must be addressed are what is the natural history of mpMRI index lesions 
over time and what mpMRI findings constitute disease progression?7 Few studies to date 
have evaluated serial mpMRI findings in men with low risk PCa8–12 and these questions 
remain largely unanswered. In this study we assessed whether changes in serial mpMRI can 
help predict the pathological progression of PCa in men on AS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
An institutional review board approved, HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act) compliant review was performed on 1,048 consecutive men who 
underwent MR-US fusion guided prostate biopsy between January 2011 and May 2015. The 
current analysis is a retrospective review of a subset of these prospectively collected data. 
From this cohort 108 men with 2 or more mpMRI examinations at least 6 months apart, each 
followed by MR-US fusion biopsy, were identified. In men with more than 2 sets of serial 
mpMRI/MR-US fusion biopsy sessions, the first and last sets were selected. An additional 6 
men were excluded from analysis due to nonroutine protocol on baseline or followup 
mpMRI, leaving 102 eligible men. Then 15 men were excluded due to Gleason 3 + 4 or 
greater on baseline MR-US fusion biopsy and 38 were excluded due to benign baseline

 biopsy, leaving a final cohort of 49 men with Gleason 6 PCa, who were enrolled in the 
UCLA AS program.6 Patients had serum PSA measurement at each MR-US fusion biopsy. 
Prostate volume was calculated using manual contouring of mpMRI examinations (fig. 1).
MRI Technique
Multiparametric MRI examinations were performed on a 3.0 T Siemens platform (Siemens 
MAGNETOM, Trio, Verio, Skyra or Prisma, Siemens Medical Solutions, Malvern, 
Pennsylvania) without an endorectal coil. The protocol included T2-weighted imaging, 
diffusion weighted imaging and dynamic contrast enhanced imaging.
Image Analysis
Image analysis was performed by 2 fellowship trained genitourinary radiologists (DJM, 
SSR), both of whom have interpreted more than 1,000 prostate mpMRIs. Radiologists were 
blinded to clinicopathological findings at the initial image interpretation. Each lesion was 
assigned a suspicion score, ranging from 1 (normal) to 5 (highly suspicious for PCa), using a 
previously published standardized assessment system.13
A third radiologist with 1 year of experience in prostate mpMRI (ERF) reviewed all studies 
quantitatively, and recorded volume and mean ADC for each lesion. Data analysis was 
performed on a DynaCAD workstation (Invivo, Gainesville, Florida).
For each mpMRI examination the lesion with the highest overall suspicion score was 
selected as the index lesion. In cases where more than 1 lesion had the same suspicion score, 
the lesion with the lower mean ADC was selected as the index lesion, based on our previous 
work demonstrating that quantitative lesion ADC is an important predictor of Gleason score 
(fig. 2).14
MR-US Fusion Biopsy and Pathological Analysis
The reference standard in all cases was MR-US fusion biopsy using the Artemis device 
(Eigen, Grass Valley, California), which included systematic biopsy of 12 sites and 
additional targeted biopsy of any suspicious lesions identified on mpMRI.15 One core of 
tissue was obtained approximately every 3 mm along the longest diameter of each target, ie 
for a 9 mm target, 3 cores would be obtained. For targets exceeding 15 mm, a maximum of 5 
cores was obtained. Patients were included regardless of whether Gleason 6 PCa was 
diagnosed on a targeted or a systematic core. Biopsy specimens were evaluated by a board 
certified genitourinary pathologist (JH). The maximum cancer core length was defined as the 
longest continuous length of cancer in any 1 biopsy core, systematic or targeted.
Study Design
Pathological progression was defined as an increase to Gleason score 3 + 4 or greater in any 
core, systematic or targeted. To test the hypothesis that changes in serial mpMRI 
examinations could predict pathological progression, a definition of MRI progression was 
devised. MRI progression was defined as an increase in index lesion suspicion score, a 
doubling of index lesion volume, or a decrease in index lesion ADC of 150 mm2 per second 
or greater on followup mpMRI.8 The ADC threshold of 150 mm2 per second was chosen

 using logistic regression analysis. Mean index lesion diameter in our study was 10.8 mm. 
Assuming the index lesion is roughly spherical, a doubling in index lesion volume would 
correspond to an approximately 3 mm increase in lesion diameter, which is consistent with 
the size thresholds used by other authors to constitute MRI progression.11,12
MRI progression was considered present if 1 or more of the previously mentioned criteria 
were satisfied. The performance of changes in serial mpMRI for predicting Gleason 
progression was evaluated with and without clinical data, including a PSAD threshold of 
0.15 ng/ml2 at followup biopsy and a MCCL 3 mm or greater on baseline biopsy. A PSAD 
of 0.15 ng/ml2 or greater was chosen as the cutoff as it is the conventional upper limit for 
inclusion in most AS protocols.16 MCCL was evaluated as it has been shown to be a 
reasonable surrogate for tumor volume.17 Using logistic regression analysis we found that a 
baseline MCCL of 3 mm or greater was the optimal threshold to predict pathological 
progression.
Statistical Analysis
Patient demographics and clinical data were reported using descriptive statistics. mpMRI 
features were compared between men who had pathological progression and men who did 
not. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the predictive value of 
changes in serial mpMRI. Multivariate logistic regression was also used to evaluate the 
relationships among MRI progression, clinical variables and pathological progression. 
Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were calculated, with p <0.05 considered statistically 
significant.
RESULTS
Patient Demographics and Clinical Features
The final patient cohort consisted of 49 patients. Mean patient age was 65 years (range 47 to 
80). Median PSA was 5 ng/ml (IQR 2.5–6.4, range 0.51 to 15). Additional patient 
demographics and clinical features are presented in table 1.
Initial MR-US Fusion Biopsy
An index lesion was identified in all but 1 of the initial 49 mpMRI examinations.Ofthese 
index lesions 9 (19%) were classified as low suspicion (grade 2), 26 (53%) were moderate 
suspicion (grade 3), 11 (23%) were high suspicion (grade 4) and 2 (4%) were extremely 
suspicious (grade 5). Quantitative index lesion features are presented in table 2.
Followup mpMRI and MR-US Fusion Biopsy
The mean interval between baseline and followup mpMRI was 28.3 months (range 11 to 
43). Of the 48 men with an index lesion identified on baseline mpMRI, in 33 (67%) the 
same index lesion was present on the subsequent mpMRI. In the remaining 15 men (33%) 
the original index lesion was no longer identifiable as a discrete lesion or was considered at 
most to have very low suspicion for PCa (grade 1). Overall 19 men (39%) had pathological 
progression, with 17 (89%) demonstrating progression to Gleason 3 + 4 and 2 (11%) 
demonstrating progression to Gleason greater than 3 + 4. Pathological progression was

 demonstrated on targeted biopsy in 9 patients (47%), on systematic biopsy in 7 (37%), and 
on systematic and targeted biopsy in 3 (16%).
Overall 10 patients had mpMRI progression, including 2 patients with an increase in index 
lesion suspicion score, 1 with a doubling of index lesion volume, 3 with a decrease in index 
lesion ADC 150 mm2 per second or greater and 4 with a combination thereof. Of the 10 men 
with MRI progression 7 also demonstrated pathological progression on followup biopsy 
(table 3).
Performance of Serial mpMRI for Predicting Pathological Progression
Differences in patient demographics, clinical features and mpMRI findings between patients 
with pathological progression and those without are presented in table 4.
The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of mpMRI alone for predicting pathological 
progression was 37%, 90%, 69% and 70%, respectively. AUC was 0.63.
The performance of baseline MCCL and PSAD at subsequent biopsy for predicting 
pathological progression is presented in table 5. A logistic regression model combining these 
2 clinical features (MCCL 3 mm or greater at baseline biopsy or PSAD 0.15 ng/ml2 or 
greater at followup biopsy) yielded an AUC of 0.87 for the prediction of pathological 
progression.
Of the 19 patients with pathological progression 2 had progression detected solely on the 
basis of serial mpMRI findings. The addition of serial mpMRI data to the logistic regression 
model significantly improved the AUC to 0.91 (p = 0.044).
DISCUSSION
The widespread adoption of PSA screening in the United States has led to a fundamental 
shift in PCa diagnosis toward men with low risk disease.18 There is growing acceptance of 
active surveillance as a viable treatment strategy for many of these men. Most contemporary 
AS protocols call for periodic biopsy, conventionally performed in a blind fashion using 
ultrasound guidance. If proven to be an accurate indicator of prostate pathology, mpMRI 
might be an attractive alternative for noninvasive monitoring of men on AS.
Thus, we evaluated the potential role for serial mpMRI examinations in predicting 
reclassification in a cohort of men on AS for low risk PCa, using an index lesion based 
analysis. We selected this approach because many prior studies have demonstrated that the 
index lesion drives pathological progression of PCa and that mpMRI can reliably localize 
the site of the index lesion.19,20 Using the index lesion based approach we created a mpMRI 
definition of disease progression, which included an increase in index lesion suspicion score, 
decrease in index lesion ADC and increase in index lesion volume.
Similar to previous authors,10,11 we observed a high specificity of changes in serial mpMRI 
(90%) but a low sensitivity (37%) for predicting pathological progression. This is not 
unexpected because the relationship of mpMRI findings to underlying pathology has not yet 
been fully clarified. Additionally, some PCa is not visible or shows poor conspicuity on

 mpMRI, due in part to variable histological architecture.21 To investigate whether mpMRI 
contributes significant incremental information to conventional clinical data, we performed 
logistic regression analysis using clinical data with and without serial mpMRI. The addition 
of serial mpMRI significantly improved the performance of the logistic regression model, 
suggesting that mpMRI contributes unique information about the likelihood of PCa 
progression. Although the relative improvement over conventional clinical data achieved 
with the addition of mpMRI was relatively small, it is important to note that the baseline 
MCCL was also influenced by mpMRI, as it was obtained via a MRI targeted biopsy. 
Therefore, the true incremental value of mpMRI is likely somewhat higher than reported 
here.
Rosenkrantz et al evaluated the association between changes in suspicious prostate lesions 
on serial MRI and followup biopsy results in 55 patients.11 As in our study, they observed a 
low sensitivity (23% to 35%) of MRI for predicting positive followup biopsy results but a 
high specificity (76% to 90%). Mean followup in their study was only 14 months and the 
majority of patients did not have known PCa at the initial mpMRI. In another of the largest 
series to date, Walton Diaz et al evaluated the use of serial mpMRI and MR-US fusion 
biopsy in the treatment of patients on AS.10 The authors evaluated 58 patients on AS and 
concluded that the combination of mpMRI and MR-US fusion biopsy appears promising as 
an aid for decreasing the number of serial biopsies among patients on AS. Median followup 
in their study was only 16 months. Unlike these prior studies, we evaluated index lesion size 
using volume, not diameter. Obtaining an accurate measurement of prostate lesion size is 
challenging because prostate tumors do not usually form discrete masses with clear margins. 
Therefore, we elected to measure volume because it allows measurement over several slices 
and improved quantification.
The combination of serial mpMRI data with PSAD and MCCL was used in this study to 
predict the pathological progression of PCa in men on AS. The PSAD threshold of 0.15 
ng/ml2 was established as an important cut point by Epstein et al in 1994 and has been 
widely confirmed.16 The MCCL threshold of 3 mm or greater on baseline biopsy was 
derived using logistic regression analysis and closely mirrors that recently reported by 
Ahmed et al, who found that a MCCL of 4 mm or greater was an optimal threshold for 
characterizing clinically significant PCa.22
Our study has several limitations. In addition to its retrospective nature, the sample size was 
relatively small. Inclusion criteria were limited to men with Gleason 6 PCa and results may 
not apply to men with low volume secondary pattern 4 disease, some of whom are now 
being included on AS. Although the followup interval of 28 months is significantly longer 
than that reported in prior similar studies, it still may not have been long enough to capture 
additional cases of PCa which ultimately would have shown progression. Nonetheless, as 
systematic biopsy is currently being performed annually in most patients on AS, the study 
period was long enough to generate clinically relevant data for this population. In addition, 
as we used an index lesion based analysis and secondary or satellite lesions were not 
systematically assessed, it is possible that with time some of these lesions could contribute 
to pathological progression. Because our study population was limited to men with positive 
baseline MR-US fusion targeted biopsies, the prevalence of suspicious findings on mpMRI

 is likely higher than would be observed in men enrolled in AS based on a conventional 
systematic biopsy.
In conclusion, our findings suggest that mpMRI stability along with supportive PSAD (less 
than 0.15 ng/ml2 at followup) and low volume PCa at baseline (less than 3 mm MCCL) can 
be used to define a group of men with very low risk PCa in whom pathological progression 
is very unlikely, such that repeat prostate biopsy may be deferred. Larger, prospective studies 
will be necessary to validate these findings.
