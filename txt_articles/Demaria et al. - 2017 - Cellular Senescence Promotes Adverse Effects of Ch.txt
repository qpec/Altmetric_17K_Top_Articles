ABSTRACT 
 
Cellular senescence suppresses cancer by irreversibly arresting cell proliferation. 
Senescent cells acquire a proinfl
 ammatory senescence-associated secretory phe-
notype. Many genotoxic chemotherapies target proliferating cells nonspecifi
 cally, often with adverse 
reactions. In accord with prior work, we show that several chemotherapeutic drugs induce senescence 
of primary murine and human cells. Using a transgenic mouse that permits tracking and eliminating 
senescent cells, we show that therapy-induced senescent (TIS) cells persist and contribute to local 
and systemic infl
 ammation. Eliminating TIS cells reduced several short- and long-term effects of 
the drugs, including bone marrow suppression, cardiac dysfunction, cancer recurrence, and physical 
activity and strength. Consistent with our fi
 ndings in mice, the risk of chemotherapy-induced fatigue 
was signifi
 cantly greater in humans with increased expression of a senescence marker in T cells prior 
to chemotherapy. These fi
 ndings suggest that senescent cells can cause certain chemotherapy side 
effects, providing a new target to reduce the toxicity of anticancer treatments. 
 
SIGNIFICANCE: Many genotoxic chemotherapies have debilitating side effects and also induce cellular 
senescence in normal tissues. The senescent cells remain chronically present where they can promote 
local and systemic infl
 ammation that causes or exacerbates many side effects of the chemotherapy.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Cellular senescence is a complex stress response whereby 
cells irreversibly lose the capacity to proliferate, accompanied 
by numerous changes in gene expression ( 
1 
). Many poten-
tially oncogenic insults induce a senescence response, which 
is now recognized as a potent tumor-suppressive mecha-
nism. Other senescence-inducing stimuli include radiation, 
genotoxic drugs, tissue injury and remodeling, and metabolic 
perturbations ( 
2 
). Moreover, senescent cells accumulate with

age in several vertebrate organisms ( 
1 
), and their elimination 
can delay the onset of several age-associated disorders in mice 
( 
3, 4 
). Senescent cells most likely promote aging through 
the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP): the 
increased expression and secretion of infl
 ammatory cytokines, 
chemokines, growth factors, and proteases ( 
5 
). 
 
Genotoxic and cytotoxic drugs are widely used as anti-
cancer therapies. Most such agents target proliferating cells 
through distinct, cell cycle–dependent mechanisms ( 
6 
). Their 
cytotoxicity for many types of dividing cells often leads 
to side effects, which include immunosuppression, fatigue, 
anemia, nausea, diarrhea, and alopecia ( 
7 
). Moreover, clinical 
studies of cancer survivors treated during childhood sug-
gest that some chemotherapies cause a range of long-term 
side effects that resemble pathologies associated with aging, 
including organ dysfunction, cognitive impairment, and sec-
ondary neoplasms ( 
8 
). 
 
Many chemotherapeutic drugs alter cellular states, includ-
ing the induction of senescence, in cancer cells and the tumor 
microenvironment ( 
9, 10 
). Therapy-induced senescence (TIS) 
can stimulate immunosurveillance to eliminate tumor cells, 
but it can also be a source of chronic infl
 ammation and drug 
resistance ( 
11 
). Indeed, a recent study showed that treatment 
of patients with breast cancer with anthracycline and alkylat-
ing agents durably induces cellular senescence and a SASP 
in a p16 
INK4a 
-dependent, telomere-independent fashion ( 
12 
). 
Expression of the tumor suppressor p16 
INK4a 
 increases with 
age and is a robust senescence marker in numerous mouse 
and human tissues ( 
13, 14 
). 
 
To more precisely assess the physiologic effects of TIS 
 
in vivo 
, we used a recently described mouse model (p16-3MR) 
in which p16 
INK4a 
-positive senescent cells can be detected in 
living animals, isolated from tissues, and eliminated upon 
treatment with an otherwise benign drug ( 
15 
). Using this 
approach, we determined the contribution of senescent cells 
to a variety of common short- and long-term chemotherapy tox-
icities. Additionally, we used a senescence marker to assess the 
relationship between senescent cells and chemotherapy toxicity 
in human patients. 
 
 
RESULTS 
 
Chemotherapy-Induced Senescence 
 
The anthracycline antibiotic doxorubicin (Doxo) is used to 
treat several types of cancers in human patients. Doxo inter-
calates into DNA and prevents topoisomerase II from reseal-
ing the DNA double-strand break, which the enzyme creates 
to relieve torsional stress ( 
16 
). Doxo also promotes histone 
eviction from chromatin, evoking a DNA-damage response 
and promoting changes in the epigenome and transcriptome 
( 
17 
). Despite reports of Doxo-induced senescence in cancer 
cells, little is known about how normal cells respond to Doxo. 
 
We exposed mouse embryonic and dermal fi
 broblasts 
(MEF and MDF) to different doses of Doxo, and identi-
fi
 ed concentrations that inhibit cell proliferation (growth; 
Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B). We selected 250 nmol/L, a 
dose at which we observed a complete growth arrest without 
signifi
 cantly reduced viability (Supplementary Fig. S1B and 
not shown). MDFs treated with 250 nmol/L Doxo showed 
a sharp rise in senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) 
activity and strong decline in DNA synthesis, as determined 
by EdU incorporation ( 
Fig. 1A 
 and Supplementary Fig. 
S1C). Senescence was further confi
 rmed by elevated levels 
of mRNAs encoding  
p16 
INK4a 
 and the SASP components 
 
Il1α, Il6, Mmp3, Mmp9, Cxcl1, Cxcl10, 
 and  
Ccl20 
 ( 
5 
) using qPCR 
( 
Fig. 1B 
), and elevated levels of p21 and reduced levels of 
LaminB1 and intracellular HMGB1 proteins ( 
5, 18, 19 
) using 
western analyses ( 
Fig. 1C 
). Doxo-induced senescent cells also 
harbored persistent DNA damage ( 
20 
), as measured by 53BP1 
foci ( 
Fig. 1D 
 and Supplementary Fig. S1D). Importantly, 
Doxo induced a similar senescent phenotype, including 
expression of senescence markers and persistent DNA dam-
age, in two human dermal fi
 broblast strains (HCA2 and BJ; 
Supplementary Fig. S1E–S1G and not shown). 
 
 
Paclitaxel is another widely used chemotherapeutic agent 
that stabilizes microtubule polymers, thereby preventing their 
disassembly and causing an arrest of mitosis. Paclitaxel also 
induced senescence in mouse cells, as measured by reduced 
cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S2A), increased SA-β-
gal activity (Supplementary Fig. S2B), elevated expression 
of  
p16 
INK4a 
 and several SASP factors ( 
Il1α, Il6, Mmp3, Mmp9, 
Cxcl1, Cxcl10, 
 and  
Ccl20 
), as well as reduced expression of 
 
LaminB1 
 (Supplementary Fig. S2C). 
 
To determine the impact of TIS  
in vivo 
, we used our recently 
developed mouse model (p16-3MR), which contains func-
tional domains of Renilla luciferase (LUC), monomeric red fl
 u-
orescent protein (mRFP), and a truncated herpes simplex virus 
(HSV)-1 thymidine kinase (tTK) under control of the senes-
cence-sensitive  
p16 
INK4a 
 
 promoter ( 
15 
). Because LUC allows the 
detection of 3MR-expressing cells, we followed the induction 
of senescent cells by bioluminescence using a range of Doxo 
concentrations ( 
Fig. 1E 
). Acute toxicity (excessive weight loss, 
rough fur, and inactivity) was evident at the highest dose 
(25 mg/kg). We therefore used a single dose of 10 mg/kg for 
subsequent experiments. This dose appears to be biologically 
effective in that it can induce an antitumor response and tox-
icity (e.g., myelosuppression) but is well below the maximally 
tolerated doses. For comparison, human patients receive 6 to 
8 biologically effective doses of Doxo at 1.25 mg/kg (∼50 mg/m 
2 
), 
and cumulative toxicity is observed at 12.5 mg/kg (∼400 mg/m 
2 
). 
Interestingly, in accord with human studies ( 
12 
), this Doxo 
dose caused a 3-fold increase in whole-body bioluminescence 
( 
Fig. 1E and F 
), regardless of sex. The magnitude of the increase 
in bioluminescence was comparable to the increase in  
p16 
INK4a 
 
 
mRNA in different tissues, including skin, lung, and liver 
( 
Fig. 1G 
). Different cell types were induced to senescence by 
Doxo treatment, as shown in the skin where keratinocytes, 
endothelial cells, and, to a lesser extent, fi
 broblasts and smooth 
muscle cells were p21 
+ 
 by immunostaining (Supplementary 
Fig. S3A). Importantly, the bioluminescence and expression 
levels of  
p16 
INK4a 
, Il6 
, and  
Cxcl10 
 persisted for several weeks ( 
Fig. 
1H and Supplementary Fig. S3B). Similar to our data using 
Doxo, three other chemotherapeutic agents, paclitaxel, temo-
zolomide (TMZ), and cisplatin, induced bioluminescence in 
p16-3MR mice (Supplementary Fig. S3C and S3D). Paclitaxel, 
TMZ, and cisplatin also elevated  
p16 
INK4a 
 
 expression in skin 
(Supplementary Fig. S3E). These data indicate that cytotoxic 
chemotherapeutic agents with different mechanisms of action 
can induce senescence in primary cells in culture, and in dif-
ferent tissues and cell types  
in vivo

Acute and chronic infl
 ammatory responses are major 
hurdles for the benefi
 cial outcomes of many anticancer 
chemotherapies ( 
21 
). Indeed, high local and systemic lev-
els of chemotherapy-induced cytokines and chemokines are 
associated with short-, medium-, and long-term side effects 
of the drugs. 
 
Because senescent cells generated by Doxo and paclitaxel 
activated a SASP, which includes infl
 ammatory factors, we 
investigated the impact of these cells in Doxo-treated p16-

ganciclovir (GCV); the tTK moiety of 3MR phosphorylates 
GCV, converting it to a toxic DNA metabolite that incorpor-
ates into mitochondrial DNA and kills cells by apoptosis 
( 
15 
). We treated p16-3MR mice with Doxo, followed by GCV 
treatment 5 days later. GCV markedly reduced biolumines-
cence and the expression of  
p16 
INK4a 
 
 in Doxo-treated animals 
( 
Fig. 2A and B 
 and Supplementary Fig. S4A). GCV also 
reduced the number of cells with DNA damage foci ( 
Fig. 2C 
 
and Supplementary Fig. S4B). As expected, Doxo increased the 
expression of SASP factor genes associated with infl
 ammation 
in the lungs of p16-3MR mice treated with Doxo ( 
Fig. 2B 
), 
many (but not all) of which declined 7 days after GCV treat-
ment ( 
Fig. 2B 
). Thus, removal of senescent cells was suffi
 cient 
to reduce many of the Doxo-induced infl
 ammatory cytokines 
and chemokines in the tissue. Secreted factors not affected by 
GCV might be due to their expression by p21 
+ 
/p16 
INK4a- 
 cells, 
or might be independent of senescence. We also detected 
a signifi
 cant increase in serum levels of the cytokine IL6 
and chemokine CXCL1 in treatment with Doxo, which were 
reduced by GCV ( 
Fig. 2D and E 
). As expected, Doxo-treated 
MEFs also secreted higher levels of IL6 and CXCL1 compared 
with vehicle-treated cells (Supplementary Fig. S4C and S4D). 
 
 
Acute and chronic infl
 ammatory responses often result 
from impairment of the immune system after chemotherapy. 
Indeed, bone marrow suppression is a major limiting factor for 
the tolerance and effi
 ciency of these therapies. To determine 
whether the infl
 ammatory indicators in Doxo-treated mice 
were partly due to bone marrow suppression, we determined 
the number and distribution of bone marrow cells (BMC) 
after treatment of female mice. There was a slight but not 
signifi
 cant reduction in the total number of BMCs 2 weeks 
after Doxo treatment, which was rescued upon elimination of 
senescent cells by GCV (Supplementary Fig. S5A). We detected 
no differences in the percentages of Lin 
– 
Sca1 
+ 
c-Kit 
+ 
 (LSK) cells, 
hematopoietic stem cells (HSC; CD150 
+ 
CD48 
– 
LSK cells) and 
hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC; Lin 
– 
Sca1 
– 
c-Kit 
+ 
 cells), 
suggesting the Doxo regimen we used did not affect the 
number or ratio of BM HSCs and HPCs (Supplementary Fig. 
S5B–S5D). Also, we observed no signifi
 cant difference in blood 
cell counts, suggesting that the Doxo regimen we used induces 
only mild and transient myelosuppression (not shown). 
 
We also measured HPC function by a colony formation 
assay. Strikingly, the number of colony-forming unit (CFU)-
GEMM (granulocyte, erythrocyte, monocyte, and megakar-
yocyte) and CFU-GM (granulocyte and monocyte) cells was 
signifi
 cantly reduced by Doxo treatment, but rescued upon 
elimination of senescent cells by GCV ( 
Fig. 2F and G 
). This 
fi
 nding was confi
 rmed by 2-week cobblestone area–forming 
cell (CAFC) assays, which measure the function of HPCs. 
The number of 2-week CAFCs was signifi
 cantly decreased 
in BMCs isolated from Doxo-treated animals, but not from 
animals in which senescent cells were eliminated ( 
Fig. 2H 
). 
 
One major limitation to the Doxo dose that can be given 
to patients is cardiotoxicity, largely due to thickening of the 
left ventricle wall ( 
22 
). Importantly, the Doxo dose used in 
our model was suffi
 cient to induce cellular senescence in the 
heart, as measured by induction of  
p16 
INK4a 
 and  
p21 expression 
(Supplementary Fig. S6A–S6C). Interestingly, the majority of 
cardiac senescent cells were CD31 
+ 
 endothelial cells and, to 
a lesser extent, fi
 broblast-like cells, but not cardiomyocytes 
(Supplementary Fig. S6D and S6E and not shown). To evalu-
ate heart function in mice treated with Doxo with or without 
the elimination of senescent cells, we used echocardiography. 
As expected, Doxo caused a decline in fractional shortening 
(contraction) and ejection fraction (blood volume pumping 
capacity;  
Fig. 2I and J 
). Strikingly, treatment with GCV almost 
completely prevented these declines ( 
Fig. 2I and J 
). There 
was no effect of any of the treatments on heart rate ( 
Fig. 
2K 
). These fi
 ndings indicate that senescent cells contribute 
to chemotherapy-induced cardiac dysfunction. Notably, the 
cardiac dysfunction was signifi
 cantly detectable 4 weeks after 
Doxo treatment, but not earlier (Supplementary Fig. S6F and 
S6G), suggesting that the persistence of senescent cells after 
chemotherapy is important for the cardiotoxicity. 
 
Thus, upon elimination of senescent cells after Doxo treat-
ment, it was possible to reduce the burden of circulating infl
 am-
matory factors, promote the functional recovery of HPCs, and 
prevent cardiac dysfunction, thus limiting the drug toxicity. 
 
 
Cancer Spread and Relapse 
 
Another important side effect of chemotherapy is cancer 
relapse. To study the consequence of eliminating senescent 
cells on cancer recurrence and spread, we used the murine 
breast cancer cell line MMTV-PyMT, which expresses the viral 
oncogene Polyoma middle-T antigen. When implanted into 
the mammary fat pad, MMTV-PyMT cells grow  
in situ 
 and 
subsequently spread to distal tissues, preferentially the lung 
and liver ( 
23 
). We used MMTV-PyMT cells that express Firefl
 y 
luciferase (fLUC), enabling us to monitor the cells in living ani-
mals by bioluminescence using a substrate distinct from that 
used to detect senescent cells in p16-3MR mice. Because these 
tumor cells do not express the p16-3MR transgene, we can dis-
tinguish the effects of chemotherapy on the tumor cells from 
the effects of normal cells induced to senesce by chemotherapy. 
 
We injected fLUC-expressing MMTV-PyMT cells into 
mammary fat pads of p16-3MR mice. Once tumors were pal-
pable, we treated the mice with vehicles, Doxo + PBS or Doxo 
+ GCV. As expected, Doxo retarded or transiently arrested 
tumor growth, as indicated by an increase in mouse survival 
( 
Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S7A). After a 1- to 2-week 
dormancy period, primary tumors resumed growth, with 
similar kinetics in the Doxo + PBS and Doxo + GCV groups 
(Supplementary Fig. S7A). However, mice in the Doxo + GCV 
group showed increased survival, which was independent of 
the size of the primary tumor ( 
Fig. 3A and Supplementary 
Fig. S7A). Strikingly, although a majority (∼80%) of mice 
treated with Doxo + PBS developed metastasis in the lung 
and liver, detectable by fLUC, many fewer (20%) mice in the 
Doxo + GCV group developed metastases ( 
Fig. 3B and C 
). 
Regrowth of the primary tumors and ulcerations at the pri-
mary tumor sites prevented us from determining a full sur-
vival curve of these animals. Nonetheless, the data show that 
the removal of senescent cells after chemotherapy can prevent 
or delay cancer relapse and spread to distal tissues. 
 
 
Patients diagnosed with breast cancer are most commonly 
treated with surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy or 
targeted therapy. To mimic this regimen in mice, we surgically 
removed MMTV-PyMT tumors once palpable (Supplementary 
Fig. S7B), then treated the animals with Doxo + PBS or Doxo + 
GCV. After a short latency period due to Doxo treatment,

 Cellular Senescence and Chemotherapy
RESEARCH BRIEF
 
FEBRUARY  2017�CANCER DISCOVERY | 171 
 
primary tumors recurred in all the mice ( 
Fig. 3D 
). However, the 
kinetics of regrowth of the primary tumors depended on the 
type of treatment the mice received after resection ( 
Fig. 3D 
 and 
Supplementary Fig. S7C). At the time of sacrifi
 ce, tumors from 
the Doxo + PBS group averaged 16 mm in diameter, whereas 
tumors from the Doxo + GCV group averaged only 10 mm, as 
refl
 ected by signifi
 cant differences in the tumor biolumines-
cence signals ( 
Fig. 3D 
, and not shown). Consistent with our 
fi
 nding in the previous experiment, the number of mice with 
metastasis was substantially lower in the Doxo + GCV group 
compared with the Doxo + PBS group ( 
Fig. 3E 
). Moreover, 
mice from the Doxo + GCV group that did develop metastasis 
showed signifi
 cantly fewer metastatic foci ( 
Fig. 3F and G 
). 
 
Although Doxo treatment likely induces senescence in the 
implanted tumor cells, it is important to note that the GCV treat-
ment removes only the senescent normal host cells. Thus, these 
data suggest that chemotherapy can promote tumor growth and 
metastasis by inducing the senescence of nontumor cells. 
 
To further prove that the removal of senescent cells, and 
not the GCV treatment  
per se 
, can delay cancer progression, we 
tested the effect of ABT-263, an antiapoptotic inhibitor with 
selective toxicity for senescent cells ( 
24 
). As expected, ABT-263 
eliminated Doxo-induced senescent cells from p16-3MR mice 
(Supplementary Fig. S8A). Moreover, mice that were injected 
with MMTV-PyMT cells followed by surgical removal of the 
tumors and treatment with a combination of Doxo and ABT-
263 showed delayed tumor recurrence and metastasis, similar 
to the effects of GCV (Supplementary Fig. S8B and S8C). 
 
 
Chemotherapy-Induced Fatigue 
 
Asthenia (severe fatigue) is a common and important side 
effect of cytotoxic chemotherapy. The causes of asthenia in 
patients with cancer are usually multifactorial, and chemo-
therapy-induced fatigue can persist for long periods in patients 
with resolved cancer, well after the completion of chemother-
apy ( 
25 
). To determine whether senescent cells contribute to 
reduced activity after chemotherapy, we monitored Doxo-
treated p16-3MR female mice with or without senescent cells 
for running wheel activity in metabolic cages. As expected, 
mice ran mainly at night, and Doxo signifi
 cantly reduced 
the time spent running during the 12-hour nocturnal cycle 
( 
Fig. 4A 
). Strikingly, the elimination of senescent cells was

suffi
 cient to almost entirely rescue this decline in running 
activity ( 
Fig. 4A 
). Because treatments with Doxo and GCV 
had no effect on activity and sleep during the day, we focused 
on the 12-hour nocturnal cycle ( 
Fig. 4A 
 and Supplementary 
Fig. S9A). During each nocturnal cycle, control mice ran an 
average of ∼4,000 m, whereas Doxo-treated mice ran ∼2,500 m; 
mice treated with Doxo plus GCV ran 3,800 m, which is near 
the activity of control mice ( 
Fig. 4B 
). 
 
 
To confi
 rm the benefi
 cial effect of eliminating senescent 
cells on spontaneous activity and understand the nature 
of this chemotherapy-induced fatigue, we monitored mice 
before and after treatments for running patterns and 
strength. Using running wheels in standard cages, we con-
fi
 rmed that, although Doxo/PBS-treated animals experienced 
a ∼50% decline in running activity, the elimination of senes-
cent cells by GCV or ABT-263 after the chemotherapy limited 
this reduction to ∼20% ( 
Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. 
S9B). Similarly, the decline in strength due to Doxo treat-
ment, as measured by grasping to the cage lid, was substan-
tially rescued by the elimination of senescent cells ( 
Fig. 4D 
). 
Paclitaxel-treated mice experienced similar defi
 cits in activity 
and strength, which were partially rescued by GCV-mediated 
elimination of senescent cells (Supplementary Fig. S9C and 
S9D). Moreover, the elimination of senescent cells from mice 
bearing breast cancer also substantially increased the running 
wheel activity of Doxo-treated mice 3 weeks after the cancer 
cell injections (Supplementary Fig. S9E). 
 
Reduced spontaneous activity can be due to altered metab-
olism or food intake. However, from measurements made in 
the metabolic cages, there was no signifi
 cant difference in 
basal metabolic rate (RQ) between control- and Doxo-treated 
mice, with or without senescent cells (Supplementary Fig. 
S10A). Moreover, food intake was comparable among the 
four groups, suggesting that loss of appetite or nausea was 
not responsible for the effects of Doxo on activity, at least 
for the treatment regimen used in this study ( 
Fig. 4E 
). Doxo 
caused substantial weight loss, which showed a trend toward 
rescue by GCV, but the differences were not signifi
 cant (Sup-
plementary Fig. S10B). 
 
To study the effects of senescent cells on chemotherapy-
induced toxicity in humans, we used a validated marker of  
in 
vivo senescence,  
p16 
INK4a 
 
 expression in peripheral blood T cells 
(PBTL), which we previously showed correlates with the bur-
den of senescence in both mice and humans ( 
12, 26–28 
). We 
asked whether this marker of organismal burden of senescent 
cells measured prior to therapy correlated with subsequent 
risk of chemotherapy-induced toxicity in a prospectively col-
lected cohort of 89 women with breast cancer undergo-
ing standard chemotherapy with curative intent. Patients 
received combinations of an anthracycline (60%), alkylat-
ing agent (89%), and/or taxane (95%), and most patients 
(92%) also received G-CSF (pegylated fi
 lgrastim) to minimize 
treatment-related neutropenia (Supplementary Table S1). We 
determined the correlation between prechemotherapy PBTL 
 
p16 
INK4a 
 expression and four endpoints: fatigue, neuropathy, 
any hematologic toxicity, and any nonhematologic toxicity. 
We restricted our analyses to severe toxicity (grade III or grade 
IV); each of the four prespecifi
 ed endpoints occurred with the 
expected frequency in our sample (10%–57%; Supplementary 
Table S2). 
 
To test for an association between a marker of  
in vivo 
 senes-
cence and chemotherapy toxicity, we analyzed the data in two 
standard ways. First, we compared the mean  
p16 
INK4a 
 
 expres-
sion in patients who did or did not experience a given toxicity, 
and tested for signifi
 cance using a nonparametric test (Wil-
coxon rank sum). Second, we compared the incidence of a 
given toxicity in patients within the highest quartile of  
p16 
INK4a 
 
 
expression versus the lowest quartile of  
p16 
INK4a 
 
 expression 
and estimated relative risk using a logistic regression model 
that accounted for patient age and other clinical features 
(Supplementary Table S2). We did not observe a correlation 
between PBTL  
p16 
INK4a 
 
 expression and either aggregated end-
point (all hematologic toxicities or all nonhematologic toxici-
ties), which is not surprising given the heterogeneous nature 
of these complex and compound endpoints. PBTL  
p16 
INK4a 
 
 
expression measured prior to treatment was modestly higher 
in patients who developed severe chemotherapy-induced 
neuropathy (7.94 vs. 7.49;  
P 
 = 0.11), with the incidence of 
severe neuropathy increased in patients within the highest 
quartile of  
p16 
INK4a 
 
 expression (9% vs. 0%). The association 
between  
p16 
INK4a 
 
 and neuropathy was of borderline signifi
 -
cance, which could refl
 ect either a chance association or weak 
statistical power given the small number of patients who 
developed grade III/IV neuropathy. There was a signifi
 cant 
association between severe fatigue and pretreatment PBTL 
 
p16 
INK4a 
 (7.93 vs. 7.39;  
P 
 = 0.02). Because  
p16 
INK4a 
 
 expression 
is measured on a log 
2 
 scale, this difference suggests mean 
 
p16 
INK4a 
 
 expression is ∼40% greater in patients who experi-
enced fatigue. The incidence of severe fatigue in patients with 
the highest levels of  
p16 
INK4a 
 
 was 44%, versus 5% in patients 
within the lowest quartile of  
p16 
INK4a 
 
 expression, refl
 ecting 
a ∼9-fold increase in the relative risk of fatigue ( 
P 
 = 0.03). As 
these data were age-adjusted, this suggests an  
in vivo 
 marker 
of senescence predicts toxicity independently of chronologic 
age. In accord with the murine fi
 ndings ( 
Fig. 4 
), these results 
suggest that the burden of senescent cells, estimated prior to 
therapy using PBTL  
p16 
INK4a 
 
 expression, predicts a patient’
s 
risk of developing fatigue from cytotoxic chemotherapy. 
 
 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Cellular senescence is an important tumor-suppressive 
mechanism that effi
 ciently protects long-lived organisms 
from developing cancer at a young age ( 
1 
). We and others 
have suggested that the SASP can serve several biological 
functions, either benefi
 cial or deleterious ( 
29 
). Among the 
deleterious effects, the accumulation and persistence of 
senescent cells, possibly due to decreased clearance and/
or chronic induction, can disrupt tissue homeostasis and 
drive the onset or progression of a variety of pathologies 
( 
2 
). Senescent cells are generated by many types of cancer 
chemotherapies and can potentially fuel many aspects of 
cancer progression ( 
30 
). 
 
Here, we show that four commonly used chemotherapeu-
tic drugs can induce the persistent presence of senescent 
cells in normal noncancerous tissues. TIS cells share sev-
eral characteristics with cells induced to senesce by other 
stimuli, including persistent hypoproliferation, elevated 
expression of  
p16 
INK4a 
 
, evidence of persistent DNA dam-
age, and transcriptional activation of genes encoding many

RESEARCH BRIEF

SASP factors ( 
5, 20 
). Because the SASP is thought to fuel the 
development of a variety of diseases, particularly patholo-
gies associated with chronic infl
 ammation ( 
1, 2 
), we investi-
gated the effects of senescent cells induced in noncancerous 
tissue by chemotherapy. 
 
Many chemotherapies have short-, medium-, and long-
term side effects, which often limit dosages, that require 
 
discontinuation of the treatment and/or reduce overall effi
 -
cacy. Moreover, studies of cancer survivors show that one 
long-term effect of chemotherapy is the accelerated develop-
ment of a host of age-associated diseases ( 
8 
). We show that 
TIS cells contribute to local and systemic infl
 ammation, 
as determined by increased expression of proinfl
 ammatory 
SASP factors in tissue and increased levels of infl
 ammatory 
cytokines in sera, which is reduced after removal of senescent 
cells  
in vivo 
 using p16-3MR transgenic mice. Further, the 
elimination of senescent cells limited or prevented the devel-
opment of multiple adverse reactions to chemotherapy. In 
addition, weeks after chemotherapy treatment, TIS cells were 
important for bone marrow suppression and development 
of cardiac dysfunction, both limiting factors for the use of 
some chemotherapeutic agents, particularly the anthracy-
clines. The promotion of cardiac dysfunction might be due 
to either cardiac senescent cells, which we show are primar-
ily endothelial cells, or senescence-induced infl
 ammation. 
Senescent nontumor cells were important for cancer relapse 
and spread to distal tissues after chemotherapy, at least in 
the breast cancer model we used. Moreover, clearing senes-
cent cells increased overall spontaneous physical activity in 
the presence or absence of cancer. Importantly, these murine 
fi
 ndings were validated in a human cohort, showing that 
p16 
INK4a expression in peripheral T cells predicts chemother-
apy-induced fatigue in human patients with breast cancer. 
We believe this latter fi
 nding is consistent with recent work 
showing that aging is the major risk factor for long-term 
(>2 or >5 years) fatigue after chemotherapy treatment ( 
25 
). 
 
A limitation of our study relates to the conversion of drug 
dosing in humans and mice. Drug pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics differ signifi
 cantly between rodents and 
humans, and a potential concern of these results is that senes-
cence induction  
in vivo 
 results from pharmacologically unre-
alistic doses in mice, as opposed to those used in humans. 
Considering our results in pharmacodynamic rather than 
pharmacokinetic terms, however, we note that the murine 
experiments used doses of these compounds that induce a 
biologic effect (tumor reduction, myelosuppression, etc.) but 
are sublethal. This is precisely the way such agents are used 
in humans; that is, at doses near the maximally tolerated 
dose that induce tumor response as well as cytoxicity (e.g., 
myelosuppression). Therefore, it seems reasonable to infer 
that a pharmacologically active dose in either species causes 
the accumulation of senescent cells  
in vivo 
. Additionally, we 
showed these effects in mice with multiple compounds, sug-
gesting that the accumulation of senescent cells in response 
to DNA-damaging agents appears to be a general property 
of cytotoxic chemotherapy administered at a biologically 
effective dose, and is not parochial to one of the compounds 
studied. Finally, we believe these results are in line with 
other results suggesting that cytotoxic chemotherapy induces 
senescence in humans ( 
10, 12, 27, 31 
). In aggregate, we believe 
these results show that a variety of DNA-damaging agents 
potently and rapidly increase the  
in vivo 
 burden of senescent 
cells in humans and mice, and the accumulation of such cells 
causes long-term toxicity for the host. 
 
Because many cytokines, chemokines, proteases, and 
growth factors comprise the SASP ( 
5 
), it was conceivable 
that senescent cells might contribute to several side effects 
associated with cancer treatments. The data presented here 
show a direct role for TIS cells in mice and a strong cor-
relation between fatigue and senescent cells in humans. 
An alternative approach, then, is to develop therapies that 
can selectively target senescent cells (senolytics) and/or 
the SASP, an approach that recently showed promise ( 
24 
). 
Indeed, the administration of a senolytic agent, ABT-263, 
effi
 ciently eliminated senescent cells, improved physical 
activity, and reduced cancer relapse in mice treated with 
Doxo. Such therapeutic approaches will, of course, need 
to carefully consider whether there are benefi
 cial effects 
of TIS, such as promoting the repair of tissues damaged 
by the chemotherapy or the potential of senescent cells to 
activate the immune response to tumor cells. Nonetheless, 
the pharmacologic removal of senescent cells from the 
tumor microenvironment might be an innovative strategy 
to limit toxicities of current chemotherapies, with con-
sequent improvements in the health span and possibly life 
span of patients with cancer. 
 
 
METHODS 
 
 
Cell Preparation and Culture 
 
Embryos 13.5 days old were dissected and cultured to produce 
MEFs, and fi
 broblasts were isolated from the dorsal skin of 3-month-
old mice, as described ( 
15 
). Primary mouse cells were expanded 
for no more than 10 doublings. Human fi
 broblasts (HCA2) were 
obtained from O. Pereira-Smith (The University of Texas Health 
Science Center, San Antonio). Cells were not reauthenticated by the 
laboratory, but regularly monitored for  
Mycoplasma 
 contaminations 
(once/2 weeks). All cells were cultured in 3% oxygen for at least 4 
doublings prior to use. MMTV-PyMT cells were purchased from 
ATCC, which validates cell lines by short tandem repeat profi
 ling, 
transduced with lentiviruses expressing fi
 refl
 y luciferase (Perkin 
Elmer), and used for no more than 6 months after purchase. Doxo 
hydrochloride and paclitaxel (Sigma Aldrich) were dissolved in 
DMSO at 100 mmol/L and diluted in serum-containing medium. 
Cell viability was assessed using the MTS assay (Promega) according 
to the manufacturer’
s protocol 
. 
 
 
Mice 
 
p16-3MR mice ( 
15 
) were maintained in the AAALAC-accredited 
Buck Institute for Research on Aging (Novato, CA) animal facil-
ity. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care 
and Use Committee. p16-3MR mice were bred in-house. For  
in vivo 
 
luminescence and tissue extraction, both male and female mice were 
used. For all the other experiments, female mice were used. For Doxo 
treatments, 10- to 16-week-old p16-3MR mice were injected i.p. once 
with 2, 10, or 25 mg/kg of Doxo hydrochloride (Sigma Aldrich) in 
PBS, and treated 5 days later with vehicle or GCV. GCV was admin-
istered via daily i.p. injections for 5 consecutive days at 25 mg/kg in 
PBS. Control mice were injected with an equal volume of PBS. For 
paclitaxel treatments, 10- to 16-week-old p16-3MR mice were injected 
3 times i.p. (once daily for 3 consecutive days) with 10 mg/kg of 
paclitaxel (Sigma Aldrich) in PBS/5% DMSO, and treated 5 days later 
with vehicle or GCV. GCV was administered via daily i.p. injections for

5 consecutive days at 25 mg/kg in PBS. Control mice were injected 
with an equal volume of PBS. For temozolomide treatments, 10- to 
16-week-old p16-3MR mice were injected 3 times i.p. (once daily 
for 3 consecutive days) with 50 mg/kg (Sigma Aldrich) in PBS/5% 
DMSO/0.1% Tween. For cisplatin treatments, 10- to 16-week-old p16-
3MR mice were injected 3 times i.p. (once daily for 3 consecutive days) 
with 2.3 mg/kg (Enzo Life Sciences) in PBS/1% DMSO. 
 
MMTV-PyMT-fLUC cells (10 
5 
) were injected into the inguinal 
mammary fat pad. Surgical removal was done under total body 
anesthesia (isofl
 uorane), and wounds were closed with metal stitches. 
Analgesia was injected subcutaneously presurgery and up to 48 hours 
after surgery (buprenorphine). 
 
 
Real-Time PCR 
 
Total RNA was prepared using the PureLink Micro-to-Midi total 
RNA Purifi
 cation System (Life Technologies). RNA was reverse tran-
scribed into cDNA using a kit (Applied Biosystems). qRT-PCR reac-
tions were performed as described ( 
15 
) using the Universal Probe 
Library system (Roche). Primer/probe sets for human and mouse 
 
p16 
,  
LMNB1 
,  
IL1a 
,  
IL6 
,  
MMP3 
,  
MMP9 
, and  
CXCL1 
 were as previ-
ously reported ( 
15, 32 
). Additionally, the following sets were used: 
 
CXCL10 
 forward 5′-gctgccgtcattttctgc-3′, reverse 5′-tctcactggcccgt-
catc-3′, probe #3;  
CCL20 
 forward 5′-aactgggtgaaaagggctgt-3′, reverse

CCL7 
 forward 5′-ttctgtgcctgct-
gctcata-3′, reverse 5′-ttgacatagcagcatgtggat-3′, probe 89. 
 
 
Bioluminescence 
 
For  
in vivo 
 luminescence of Renilla Luciferase, mice were injected 
i.p. with 15 μg of Xenolight RediJect Coelentarazine h (Calipers/Per-
kin Elmer). Twenty-fi
 ve minutes later, the mice were anesthetized with 
isofl
 uorane and luminescence was measured with a Xenogen IVIS-200 
Optical Imaging System (Caliper Life Sciences; 5-minute medium bin-
ning). For  
in vivo 
 luminescence of Firefl
 y Luciferase, mice were injected 
i.p. with 150 mg/kg of Xenolight  
D 
-Luciferin (Calipers/Perkin Elmer). 
Five minutes later, the mice were anesthetized with isofl
 uorane and 
luminescence measured with a Xenogen IVIS-200 Optical Imaging 
System (Caliper Life Sciences; 3-minute medium binning). 
 
 
Immunoblot Analysis 
 
Cells were washed with warm PBS, lysed, and subjected to SDS–
PAGE using 4% to 12% Bis-Tris gels; separated proteins were trans-
ferred to nitrocellulose membranes ( 
18 
). Membranes were blocked 
and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature (LaminB1: Santa 
Cruz Biotechnology; HMGB1: Abcam) or overnight at 4°C (p21: Cal-
biochem; actin: Sigma-Aldrich) with primary antibodies. Membranes 
were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (1:5,000; 
Cell Signaling)–conjugated secondary antibodies for 45 minutes 
at room temperature and washed again. Signals were detected by 
enhanced chemiluminescence. 
 
 
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA) 
 
ELISA kits to detect IL6 and CXCL1 were from R&D Systems and 
used according to the manufacturer’
s protocols. Conditioned media 
were prepared by washing cells with serum-free DMEM and incubat-
ing in serum-free DMEM for 24 hours. For Doxo-treated cells, media 
were collected 10 days after treatment. ELISA results were normalized 
to cell number. Mouse sera was isolated by centrifugation. 
 
 
Immunofl
 uorescence 
 
Cells or optimal cutting temperature (OCT 
) compound–embedded 
lungs on glass coverslips were washed in PBS, fi
 xed in 4% paraform-
aldehyde, quenched with 50 mmol/L glycine, permeabilized with 
0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS, saturated with 3% goat serum (Life Tech-
nologies), and incubated with 53bp1 and γH2AX primary antibodies 
at room temperature (Novus Biologicals) for 1 hour, followed by 
incubation with Alexa fl
 uorescein-labeled secondary antibodies (Life 
Technologies) for 45 minutes and mounted using Prolong Fade with 
Dapi (Life Technologies). 
 
 
Metabolism and Activity 
 
p16-3MR mice were individually housed for 3 days prior to being 
transferred to an isolated room and monitored using a Promethion 
system (Sable Systems) for 4 consecutive days. Alternatively, after 
3 days of acclimation to single housing, mice were transferred to 
cages enriched with a running wheel (Columbus Instruments) and 
measured for 3 nights. Food intake was measured by weighing the 
chow every 24 hours. For grip strength, individual mice were trained 
for 3 trials and then grasping time measured over a subsequent 
3 trials and averaged. 
 
 
Collection of BMCs 
 
The femora and tibiae were harvested from mice immediately 
after they were euthanized with CO 
2 
. BMCs were fl
 ushed from the 
bones into Hank’
s Balanced Salt Solution containing 2% FCS using 
a 21-gauge needle and syringe. The total number of BMCs harvested 
from the two hind legs of each mouse was determined after red 
blood cells were lysed. 
 
 
 
Analysis of the Frequencies of Hematopoietic Cell 
Populations by Flow Cytometry 
 
BMCs were preincubated with biotin-conjugated anti-CD3e, anti-
CD45R/B220, anti-Gr-1, anti-CD11b, and anti-TER119 antibodies 
and with anti-CD16/32 antibody to block the Fcγ receptors. They 
were then stained with streptavidin-FITC and anti-Sca1-PE-Cy7, 
c-Kit-APC-Cy7, CD150-APC, and CD48-Pacifi
 c blue. The frequencies 
of HPCs (Lin 
− 
Sca1 
− 
c-Kit 
+ cells), LSK cells (Lin 
− 
Sca1 
+ 
c-Kit 
+ 
 cells), and 
HSCs (CD150 
+ 
CD48 
− 
LSK cells) were analyzed with an Aria II cell 
sorter. For each sample, approximately 5 × 10 
5 
 to 1 × 10 
6 
 BMCs were 
acquired and the data analyzed using BD FACSDiva 6.0 (BD Bio-
sciences) and FlowJo software. 
 
 
 
Colony-Forming Cell and CAFC Assays 
 
The colony-forming cell assay was performed by culturing BM-
MNCs (mononuclear cells) in MethoCult GF M3434 methylcel-
lulose medium (Stem Cell Technologies Inc.). Colonies of CFU-GM 
were scored on day 7, and colonies of CFU-GEMM were scored on 
day 12 of the incubation, according to the manufacturer’
s protocol. 
The CAFC assay was performed as described ( 
24 
). 
 
 
Echocardiography 
 
Two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography was performed 
as described ( 
29 
). In brief, mice were lightly anesthetized using 
1.5% isofl
 urane mixed with 100% O 
2 
 during the time of imaging. 
Echocardiography was performed prior to and following the 4-week 
experimental period using a LZ 550 series, 55-MHz MicroScan trans-
ducer probe and a Vevo 2100 Imaging System (VisualSonics; ref. 
 
33 
). Left ventricular fractional shortening and ejection fraction were 
determined from the M-mode of the parasternal short-axis view. All 
parameters were averaged from at least 3 consecutive high-resolution 
cardiac cycles for analysis. 
 
 
Patients 
 
This study, LCCC 1027, was conducted with consenting adult 
patients undergoing treatment for breast cancer at University 
of North Carolina (UNC) Hospitals, and approved by the UNC 
Institutional Review Board and registered on clinicaltrials.gov 
(NCT01305954). The study was conducted in accordance with the 
Declaration of Helsinki. Patients over the age of 18 diagnosed with

 Cellular Senescence and Chemotherapy
RESEARCH BRIEF
 
FEBRUARY  2017�CANCER DISCOVERY | 175 
stage I–IV breast cancer who were scheduled to start a new course of 
chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or metastatic setting for 
newly diagnosed or recurrent disease were consented to participate 
in the study. For this article, only neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings 
were analyzed. Patients with a history of clonal bone marrow disorder 
(e.g., acute or chronic leukemia), concurrent experimental therapy, or 
prior or current histone deacetylase inhibitor therapy were excluded. 
Patients received standard-of-care chemotherapy regimens, includ-
ing the use of growth factors. Medical history and treatment infor-
mation were abstracted from the medical record. Patients were also 
consented to undergo phlebotomy prior to the beginning of treat-
ment for molecular analyses. Molecular analyses were performed by 
investigators blinded to the patient data, and investigators collecting 
clinical information were blinded to laboratory results until data col-
lection was complete. 
 
 
Assessment of p16 Expression 
 
Blood (10 mL) was drawn into lavender (EDTA) tubes and used 
to isolate CD3 
+ T lymphocytes. Total RNA was isolated using the 
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and cDNA was prepared using ImProm-
II reverse transcriptase kit (Promega). Expression of  
p16 
INK4a 
 
 was 
measured by a TaqMan quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase 
chain reaction specifi
 c for  
p16 
INK4a 
 and normalized to the  
YWHAZ 
 
housekeeping gene. 
 
Statistical Analyses 
 
An unpaired  
t 
 test was used to calculate a  
P 
 value for pairwise 
comparisons.  
P values on multiple comparisons were calculated 
using two-way ANOVA with the Bonferroni posttest. The associ-
ation between  
p16 
INK4a 
 
 and grade 3/4 toxicities was performed using 
one-way analysis of variance.  
P values of 0.05 or less were considered 
statistically signifi
 cant. Wilcoxon  
P 
 values were used because of the 
small size of groups. Data were analyzed by A.M. Deal using SAS 
version 9.2 (SAS) and STATA version 12 (StataCorp).
