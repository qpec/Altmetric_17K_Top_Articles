Abstract
Objectives Assessing the burden of maternal mortality is
important for tracking progress and identifying public
health gaps. This paper provides an overview of the burden
of maternal mortality in the Eastern Mediterranean Region
(EMR) by underlying cause and age from 1990 to 2015.
Methods We used the results of the Global Burden of
Disease 2015 study to explore maternal mortality in the
EMR countries.
Results The maternal mortality ratio in the EMR decreased
16.3% from 283 (241–328) maternal deaths per 100,000 live
births in 1990 to 237 (188–293) in 2015. Maternal mortality
ratio was strongly correlated with socio-demographic status,
where the lowest-income countries contributed the most to
the burden of maternal mortality in the region.
Conclusion Progress in reducing maternal mortality in the
EMR has accelerated in the past 15 years, but the burden
remains high. Coordinated and rigorous efforts are needed
to make sure that adequate and timely services and inter-
ventions are available for women at each stage of repro-
ductive life.

Introduction
Maternal mortality ratio (MMR), which measures deaths
per 100,000 live births, is a standard measure for global,
regional, and national comparison (Abouzahir and Ward-
law 2001). It is also one of the main criteria of health
outcomes and an indicator of the socioeconomic develop-
ment level of countries that is recognized worldwide
(Liang et al. 2010). Country estimates of maternal mor-
tality over time are crucial to inform the planning of
maternal, sexual, and reproductive health programs and to
guide advocacy efforts and research at the national level.
These estimates are also needed at the international level to
inform decision-making concerning resource allocation by
development partners and donors (WHO et al. 2007).
In 2015, 275,288 women are estimated to have died as a
result of pregnancy or childbirth globally (Kassebaum et al.
2016b). Maternal death is defined by ICD-10 as the death
of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days and up to 1
year (late maternal death); of termination of pregnancy,
irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from
any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its
management, but not from accidental or incidental causes
(World Health Organization 1992).
The primary causes of maternal deaths are hemorrhage,
hypertension, infections, pre-existing medical conditions,
and lack of literacy, family planning (unmet need and birth

 spacing), and access to pregnancy termination when nee-
ded. Identifying and improving the main factors related to
maternal mortality depend on a correct definition of the
required priorities for appropriate prevention, diagnosis,
and treatment (Ribeiro et al. 2008).
Poverty, illiteracy, malnutrition, and the low social sta-
tus of women are usually among the major underlying
causes of maternal mortality. Analyzing the economic,
social, and health system factors affecting maternal mor-
tality can provide some credible information and evidence
for public health interventions to improve maternal health.
A few general studies on nonclinical determinants of
maternal mortality have analyzed different factors includ-
ing access to safe drinking water, access to food, fertility
rate, education level, life expectancy at birth, access to
health services, delivery done by skilled birth attendants,
out-of-pocket payment, GDP per capita, health expendi-
tures, and government corruption (Hertz et al. 1994; Mid-
het et al. 1998; Buor and Bream 2004; Alvarez et al. 2009;
Muldoon et al. 2011).
From 1990 to 2015, the global MMR decreased 30.6%
from 280.4 (95% uncertainty interval (UI): 262.6–299.0) to
194.7 (172.6–233.2) (Institute for Health Metrics and Eval-
uation 2017). This decrease was driven in part by the
recognition of maternal health as one of the priorities in the
UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which pro-
vided a strong incentive to reduce MMR by country (Rons-
mans and Graham 2006). New goals outlined in the
sustainable development goals (SDGs) for 2015 to 2030
build on the momentum of the MDGs and seek to bring the
global MMR below 70 deaths per 100,000 live births (United
Nations 2015). The greatest challenge in meeting this goal
lies with countries in the bottom two quintiles of wealth,
where improvement is most needed and has historically
occurred slowly if at all (Abouzahir and Wardlaw 2001).
The variation in MMR between countries by income
group is drastic, where the burden of maternal mortality
falls almost exclusively upon developing countries (Rons-
mans and Graham 2006). Globally, the average MMR for
countries in the top quintile of wealth for 2015 was 14.5
(13.7–15.4) compared to 440.2 (357.4–543.5) in the bottom
quintile (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation 2017).
Despite this variation, inequalities in maternal mortality
exist between and within countries, where mortality in all
locations is exacerbated by a lack of access to quality
obstetric care, whether because of the remoteness of certain
regions or the inability of health facilities to provide proper
care (Peterson et al. 2012).
The Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) is a diverse
region consisting of 22 countries, including high-income
countries, where socioeconomic development has pro-
gressed considerably over the last decades; middle-income
countries that have well-developed health service delivery
infrastructures but face resource constraints; and low-in-
come countries that lack the resources and infrastructure for
effective health interventions. Many countries in the region
are suffering from political instability, conflicts, and other
complex development challenges. This range from low to
high incomes can be seen as a microcosm of the variability in
maternal mortality present globally. This paper seeks to
examine in detail the burden of maternal mortality within the
EMR using the results of the GBD 2015 study.
Methods
A detailed methodology of maternal mortality estimation
for GBD 2015 has been published elsewhere (Kassebaum
et al. 2016b). In short, sources with population-level data
were processed using standardized algorithms to adjust for
age-specific, year-specific, and geography-specific patterns
of incompleteness. Additional steps were taken to account
for underestimations of maternal mortality in vital regis-
tration systems. ICD-10 vital registration codes pertaining
to HIV-related maternal deaths were excluded and quan-
tified separately (Kassebaum et al. 2014). Overall maternal
mortality was modeled using cause-of-death ensemble
modeling (CODEm), where all combinations of covariates
were tested and ranked on the basis of out-of-sample pre-
dictive validity performance. All data sources are available
on our website, and we provide a visualization to show
each source used in our analyses (Institute for Health
Metrics and Evaluation 2016).
We calculated years of life lost (YLLs) by multiplying
deaths by the residual expected individual lifespan at the
age of death as derived from the GBD 2015 standard model
life table. Years lived with disability (YLDs) were calcu-
lated by multiplying the number of prevalent cases of a
certain health outcome by the disability weight assigned to
this health outcome. A disability weight reflects the mag-
nitude of the health loss associated with an outcome and
has a value that is anchored between 0, equivalent to full
health, and 1, equivalent to death. YLLs were calculated by
multiplying deaths by the remaining life expectancy at the
age of death from a standard life table chosen as the norm
for estimating premature mortality in GBD. Disability-ad-
justed life years (DALYs) were calculated by adding YLLs
and YLDs. Detailed methods on YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs
are published elsewhere (Kassebaum et al. 2016a; Vos
et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2016).
We evaluated the associations between maternal mortality
and socio-demographic status using the socio-demographic
index (SDI). SDI is a composite measure developed for GBD
2015 that accounts for fertility rate, lag-dependent income per
capita, and education. To capture the average relationships for
each age group, we applied a simple least squares spline

 regression of the maternal mortality rate on SDI. The SDI is
scaled from 0 to 1, where 0 represents the lowest possible
observed SDI and 1 is the highest. We reported uncertainty for
all our estimates (Kassebaum et al. 2016a).
Results
Mortality
The total number of deaths due to maternal disorders
increased 4.5% from 38,595 (32,859–44,785) deaths in
1990 to 40,338 (31,965–49,954) in 2015 in the EMR,
compared to a 29.5% decrease globally (Institute for Health
Metrics and Evaluation 2017). In 1990, the maternal
mortality ratio was similar in the EMR and globally at 283
(241–328) maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in the
EMR and 280 (263–299) globally (Institute for Health
Metrics and Evaluation 2017). By 1995, a gap between the
regional and global trends had opened, and this persisted
steadily through 2015. By then, the EMR had a maternal
mortality
ratio
of
237 (188–293)
compared
to
194
(173–223) globally (Institute for Health Metrics and
Evaluation 2017). By country, only Afghanistan and Dji-
bouti had an annual increase in maternal mortality ratio
between 1990 and 2015 (Table 1). Palestine also had an
increase in maternal mortality ratio between 2000 and
2015, but still had a lower ratio in 2015 compared to 1990
(Table 1).
Both globally and regionally, maternal hemorrhage was
the leading cause of maternal mortality in 1990 and 2015
(Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation 2017). By
country within the EMR, hemorrhage was also the most
common, followed by other maternal disorders, noticeably
within the Gulf states (Fig. 1). In all countries, all causes of
maternal mortality decreased from 1990 to 2015 (Table 2).
In 2015, maternal hemorrhage in Somalia was the largest
contributor to maternal mortality by country and causes at
72.3 (13.2–229.0) deaths per 100,000 among women aged
15–49 (Table 2). The GBD study expanded the analysis to
the full reproductive age range of 10–54 years (Kassebaum
et al. 2016b). In general, the countries with the highest
mortality rates by cause also showed the least improvement
from 1990 to 2015 (Table 2).
YLLs
YLL rates fell 49% in the EMR between 1990 and
2015,
the
same
as
the
global
mean,
from
2,683
(2284–3103) per 100,000 women aged 15–49 to 1377
(1091–1695) (Table 3). In that time frame, the YLL
rate decreased in all countries (Table 3). There was
significant inter-country variation in YLL rates. The
highest YLL rate in 2015 was in Somalia with 7774
(1497–23,408) YLLs per 100,000 women aged 15–49,
compared to Kuwait at 21 (16–27) (Table 3). Somalia
also had the smallest percent change from 1990 to
2015, a decrease of 18% (Table 3).
YLDs
Average YLD rates in the region fell from 161 (114–215) per
100,000 women aged 15–49 to 82 (57–113), a 49% decrease
(Table 3). Globally, there was a 41% decrease (Institute for
Health Metrics and Evaluation 2017). Inter-country vari-
ability in the YLD rate was less than that of YLLs, with the
highest seen in Somalia with 254 (171–362) YLDs per
100,000 women aged 15–49 and the lowest in the United
Arab Emirates with 16 (10–26) (Table 3).
YLL/YLD
The YLL/YLD ratio was included as an indicator of health
system effectiveness in dealing with fatal and non-fatal out-
comes of maternal disorders. Large values, such as that of
Afghanistan, a ratio of 89.6 in 2015, demonstrated cases, where
fatal outcomes heavily outweigh non-fatal ones (Table 3).
Kuwait in 2015 had a ratio of 1.11, signifying a near equal
burden of fatal and non-fatal outcomes for maternal disorders
(Table 3). Lower income countries with SDI less than 0.5 all
had ratios greater than 10, whereas higher income countries
with SDI greater than 0.7 had ratios under 4 (Table 3). In the
countrieswithSDIlessthan0.5,allbutSudanhadanincreasein
YLL/YLD ratio from 1990 to 2015 (Table 3). Large decreases
in the ratio from 1990 to 2015 highlighted effective improve-
ments in treatment, such as in Morocco, where the ratio
decreased from 35.2 to 8.5 (Table 3).
DALYs
From 1990 to 2015, DALY rates decreased in all countries
in the region. The overall DALY rate for the region
decreased by 49% during this interval, compared to 51%
globally (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation 2017).
As discussed in the YLL/YLD section above, the propor-
tional contribution of YLDs to the DALYs rate increased
as SDI increased (Table 3). Like YLL rates, DALY rates
showed large inter-country variation, as shown in Fig. 2.
DALY
rates
peaked
in
the
20–25-year
age
group,
decreasing until ages 35–40, then steeply falling off in
5-year increments (Fig. 3). By sub-cause, complication of
abortions contributed the most to the DALY rate in young
(10–15) and old (45?) age groups (e-Fig. 1). Percent of
DALYs attributable to obstructed labor increased steadily
with age, spiking drastically for the 50–55-year age group
(e-Fig. 1).

 Discussion
Our study showed that maternal mortality has declined in
the EMR except in Djibouti, Palestine, and Afghanistan in
recent years. However, the burden is still higher than the
global average. Our findings call for increased efforts to
reduce maternal mortality in the region. Moreover, with
unrest in the region, there is a risk of losing some of the
observed gains.
Efforts to reduce maternal mortality in the EMR have
varied in scope, approach, and success by country. This has
resulted in great variations and disparities in maternal
mortality levels between countries. The high-income
countries in the region (Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Ara-
bia, and United Arab Emirates) have achieved reductions
between 25 and 50% compared to levels in 1990. Maternal
mortality ratios in these countries ranged from 6 to 26
deaths per 100,000 live births, consistent with countries of
similar income around the world. Certain middle-income
countries such as Morocco and Jordan have successfully
implemented interventions that have drastically reduced
maternal mortality by greater than 75% from 1990 levels.
Low-income countries have seen the least improvement, or
in some cases none at all. Reduction in maternal mortality
in Pakistan, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen ranged from 11 to
39%, and maternal mortality in Afghanistan and Djibouti
increased from 1990 to 2015. Maternal mortality ratios for
these countries ranged from 299 deaths per 100,000 live
births in Sudan to 789 in Afghanistan. This discussion will
examine the obstacles to effective maternal care, the direct
and underlying causes of maternal mortality, and the
challenges faced by countries in the region to improve
maternal health.
The process of improving maternal health in the region
faces many challenges which have slowed progress in
recent years. For many years, the EMR has been devastated
by manmade disasters and conflicts, which have destroyed
infrastructure in several nations and have tremendously
affected the health of the population, especially for vul-
nerable groups such as mothers and children. The human-
itarian community has made several efforts to address these
challenges, and these have reduced the potential impact of
the unrest. However, the disruption of health care systems
has had a negative impact. The social and health impacts of
political instability, domestic crises, and economic sanc-
tions are well-documented in the region (Mokdad et al.
2016). Recent distress in the region will result in deterio-
rating health conditions in these countries for many years
to come. Despite this, however, the region has experienced
improved health and life expectancy.
The region is in need of efforts to improve preventive
strategies for reducing maternal mortality. A literature

Maternal mortality and morbidity burden in the Eastern Mediterranean Region: findings from…

 review (Warren et al. 2015) that evaluated the evidence on
the effectiveness of sexual and reproductive health inter-
ventions delivered in humanitarian crises found some evi-
dence to support increased access and demand creation for
family
planning
services
through
community
health
workers, health care subsidies, and discussions within lit-
eracy groups. Involving communities in maternal and child
health and birth preparedness programs, as well as refur-
bishing clinics and hospital facilities, was also associated
with increased positive health outcomes (Warren et al.
2015).
Female genital mutilation (FMG) is still practiced in
many countries in the EMR due to a mix of sociocultural
factors within families and communities (UNICEF 2016).
Experience of FGM increases the short- and long-term
health risks to women and young girls between infancy and
age 15, and is unacceptable from a human rights and health
perspective. Procedures can cause severe bleeding and
problems urinating, and later, cysts, infections, as well as
complications in childbirth and increased risk of newborn
deaths (WHO 2017).
Thaddeus and Maine provide a conceptual model for
understanding factors that obstruct favorable obstetric
outcomes that consists of three types of delays a pregnant
woman faces when seeking care—delays in deciding to
seek care, in reaching an adequate facility, and in receiving
adequate care in a facility. The first delay manifests itself in
the way women and their families perceive the accessibility
of services, often shaped by prior experiences with health
facilities. Any number of factors may influence a decision
to delay treatment, such as cost, distance, lack of proper
medical supplies, and unhelpful or impolite staff. The
second delay accounts for the time taken to reach a medical
facility. This is a particularly large obstacle for rural areas
in which the availability of transportation is uncertain or
expensive. In addition, data on maternal deaths that occur
on the way to a health facility are scarce. The third and
final delays are in receiving adequate care at health facility,
which can be attributed to insufficient staff, drugs, and
equipment. It is necessary for interventions to effectively
address the underlying causes of these delays on a country-
by-country basis (Thaddeus and Maine 1994).
This conceptual model is backed by an extensive body
of research on the direct and underlying causes of maternal
mortality. Improving women’s literacy and knowledge can
significantly contribute to their health. Alvarez et al.
reported a significant negative relationship between MMR
and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, health
expenditure (HE), women’s literacy rate, and the number
of deliveries by skilled birth attendants in the study region
in Africa (Alvarez et al. 2009). Another study in sub-Sa-
haran African countries, concluded that birth in the pres-
ence of health professionals and the life expectancy at birth
are highly correlated to maternal mortality. Furthermore, a
convincing relationship was found between GDP per capita
and health expenditure per capita and maternal mortality
(Buor and Bream 2004). Similarly, a study in Pakistan
reported that a significant relationship was observed
between having access to health services, professional
health staff, and health care during pregnancy and reduc-
tions in MMR (Midhet et al. 1998). The positive impacts of
GDP, HE, and female education level on health outcomes
were also reported in other studies in the EMR (Bayati
et al. 2013; Homaie Rad et al. 2013).
Success stories do exist in the region: for example,
Morocco was one of only ten countries globally that met
the MDG 5 requirement of an annual rate of decline
exceeding 5.5% for maternal mortality ratio every year
from 1990 to 2015 (Kassebaum et al. 2016b). This
improvement can be traced to a number of programs

 implemented to improve determinants of health and health
coverage. Increases in the number of health facilities and
training programs led to the percentage of deliveries
assisted by skilled personnel increasing from 31% in 1992
to 73.5% in 2011. Other successes in the region occurred in
Jordan and Iran, where maternal mortality was reduced by
more than 50% from levels in 1990 (Kassebaum et al.
2016b).
Uneven improvements in MMR in the region may be
related to differing levels of ramp-up in coverage for
specific types of reproductive health care—antenatal care,
in-facility delivery, skilled birth attendance, family plan-
ning services, emergency obstetric care, and post-natal
care—that are all known to decrease the risk of negative
pregnancy outcomes (Lim et al. 2010; Randive et al. 2014).
Quality of care must also be considered during buildup of
the maternal health care system. Programs for reproductive
health care must ensure that women are receiving the care
they need during pregnancy and the post-partum period
(Rowe et al. 2005). Care should be integrated and not be
focused on single vertical interventions (Campbell et al.
2006).
It has been challenging for many countries to produce
timely and accurate data on levels of maternal mortality
that would indicate the extent of their progress in reducing
maternal deaths (Mokdad et al. 2016). Reliable information

 is a necessary component of any strategy aimed at reducing
maternal mortality. Continued progress in data collection
in the EMR is key to evaluating progress in reducing
maternal mortality.
Our study has several limitations. First, many countries
in the region have poor health data and vital statistics. We
used GBD methodology to account for quality and lack of
data. We also applied our standard GBD garbage code
correction to address this limitation. Second, little infor-
mation is available on unsafe abortion in the region due to
religion and culture. However, our study is the most
comprehensive on burden of diseases and applies the
standard methodology that allows global comparison.
Conclusion
Progress in reducing maternal mortality in the EMR has
accelerated in the past 15 years, but there is still much to
do to reduce preventable deaths. Extending basic maternal
health services, improving quality of care, and eliminating
unmet need for contraception are all crucial, proven steps
effective at reducing MMR. Our study showed the impor-
tance of empowering women: increased women’s rights are
needed to improve their health. Finally, coordinated and
rigorous efforts are needed to make sure that every woman
in need receives these interventions in a timely fashion at
each stage of her reproductive life.
