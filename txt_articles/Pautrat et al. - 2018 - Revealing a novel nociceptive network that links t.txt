Abstract Pain is a prevalent symptom of Parkinson’s disease, and is effectively treated by deep
brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). However, the link between pain and the STN
remains unclear. In the present work, using in vivo electrophysiology in rats, we report that STN
neurons exhibit complex tonic and phasic responses to noxious stimuli. We also show that
nociception is altered following lesions of the STN, and characterize the role of the superior
colliculus and the parabrachial nucleus in the transmission of nociceptive information to the STN,
physiologically from both structures and anatomically in the case of the parabrachial nucleus. We
show that STN nociceptive responses are abnormal in a rat model of PD, suggesting their
dependence on the integrity of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. The STN-linked nociceptive
network that we reveal is likely to be of considerable clinical importance in neurological diseases
involving a dysfunction of the basal ganglia.

Introduction
Pain is highly prevalent in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and includes primary symptoms assumed to origi-
nate from a dysfunction of the central nervous system. Patients describe bizarre and unexplained
painful sensations such as burning, stabbing, aching, itching or tingling sensations, predominating
on the more affected side (Schestatsky et al., 2007). These symptoms are not directly related to
the pain caused by the motor symptoms (Ha and Jankovic, 2012). Sensitivity to noxious stimulation
is also increased in patients with PD, with or without pain symptoms (Berardelli et al., 2012; Brefel-
Courbon et al., 2013; Tinazzi et al., 2008), and their nociceptive threshold is altered (Chudler and
Dong, 1995; Conte et al., 2013; Djaldetti et al., 2004). Although it is well known that PD affects
the basal ganglia, there is to date no clear description of a link between the basal ganglia and the
cerebral network involved in pain. Interestingly, deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus
(STN-DBS) in PD, a valuable and effective therapeutic technique for motor symptoms (Krack et al.,
2003; Limousin et al., 1998), has also been shown to reduce pain (Cury et al., 2014;
Hanagasi et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2008; Klingelhoefer et al., 2014). By contrast, the effects of
dopamine replacement therapy on the pain symptoms in PD are controversial, with some investiga-
tions reporting an improvement, no effect or an aggravation of pain symptoms or nociceptive
thresholds (Conte et al., 2013; Dellapina et al., 2011). These variable results of dopamine replace-
ment therapy indicate a role for other systems in the pain symptoms observed in PD. Importantly in

 the present context, it has been demonstrated that pain relief following STN-DBS is superior to that
following dopaminergic treatment, further positioning STN as a crucial structure in pain symptoms in
PD and their relief (Su
¨ru
¨cu
¨ et al., 2013).
The mechanism by which STN-DBS improves pain in PD patients remains unclear, which raises a
fundamental question about the link between the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and pain. Preliminary
evidence suggests that noxious stimulation can modulate background activity in the STN, at least in
the Parkinsonian brain (Belasen et al., 2016; Heise et al., 2008). As a consequence, the STN could
be linked to a nociceptive network involved in the perception of noxious stimuli, although this has
yet to be explored fully. Despite the classical description of a sensory territory in the STN
(Alexander et al., 1986) and the functional impact that STN sensory responses could have on the
basal ganglia (Baunez et al., 2011), there is a paucity of information in the literature regarding the
type of sensory stimuli that activate this structure and the afferent sensory source(s) (Coizet et al.,
2009; Hammond et al., 1978; Matsumura et al., 1992). Two major subcortical central targets for
ascending nociceptive information from the spinal cord are potential relays for nociceptive informa-
tion to the STN: the superior colliculus (SC) and the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) (Hylden et al., 1989;
Craig, 1995; Klop et al., 2005; McHaffie et al., 1989).
We have shown that the SC, a highly conserved but evolutionarily ancient subcortical multi-sen-
sory structure, directly projects to the STN and is the primary, if not exclusive, source of visual input
into the STN (Coizet et al., 2009; Tokuno et al., 1994). This projection shows that subcortical
hyper-direct pathways exist between brainstem sensorimotor structures and the STN which predate,
from an evolutionary perspective, those from the cortex — thus reinforcing the position of the STN
as a critical input structure processing short latency visual signals in the basal ganglia (Baunez et al.,
eLife digest Parkinson’s disease is a condition affecting the human brain that becomes worse
over time. The most common symptoms are tremors, muscle spasms and movements that are much
slower than normal; all of which decrease an individual’s quality of life. Although there is currently no
cure, the brain structures involved in Parkinson’s disease are known. These are collectively termed
the basal ganglia, and are often targeted to treat the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. For
example, electrically stimulating the subthalamic nucleus (STN), one part of the basal ganglia,
reduces muscle tremors and stiffness.
Pain is another common symptom in Parkinson’s disease. Patients often report strange burning or
stabbing sensations with no obvious physical cause. They are also likely to be more sensitive to
painful stimuli and have a lower pain threshold than normal. This suggested that the brain circuits
that allow us to perceive and process pain could be somehow involved in Parkinson’s disease.
Indeed, stimulating the STN is known to relieve pain in Parkinson’s disease, as well as the muscle
symptoms, but exactly how the STN might link up with the brain’s ‘pain network’ remains poorly
understood. Pautrat et al. therefore set out to explore the connection between pain networks and
the STN, and determine its potential role in Parkinson’s disease.
First, the electrical activity of nerve cells in the STN of rats was measured, which revealed that
these cells do respond to mildly painful sensations. Experiments using dyes to label cells in both the
STN and brain structures known to transmit painful signals showed that the STN was indeed directly
linked to the brain’s pain network. Moreover, rats with a STN that did not work properly also
responded abnormally to painful stimuli, confirming that the STN did indeed influence their
perception of pain. Finally, Pautrat et al. repeated their measurements of electrical activity in the
STN, this time using rats that lacked the same group of nerve cells affected in the basal ganglia of
patients with Parkinson’s disease. Such rats are commonly used to model the disease in laboratory
experiments. In these rats, the STN cells responded very strongly to painful stimuli, suggesting that
problems with the STN could be causing some of the pain symptoms in Parkinson’s disease.
This work reveals a new role for the STN in controlling responses to pain, both in health and
disease. Pautrat et al. hope that their results will inspire research into more effective treatments of
nerve pain in both Parkinson’s disease and other neurodegenerative conditions.

 2011). The substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) is also on the input side of the basal ganglia and
we have shown that SNc receives nociceptive-related afferents from the PBN (Coizet et al., 2010),
raising the possibility that the STN may also receive such inputs.
It is interesting to note that the STN is well known to project heavily to basal ganglia output struc-
tures such as the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) (Alexander et al., 1986; Gurney et al.,
2001), which in turn projects to the SC and PBN (Schneider, 1986; Deniau and Chevalier, 1992),
linking the STN, SNr and SC/PBN anatomically. With the STN in a position to modulate a nociceptive
network involving the SC/PBN, the elevated activity in the STN in Parkinsonism (Bergman et al.,
1994; Albin et al., 1995) could underlie some of the unexplained pain symptoms in this disease,
with STN-DBS acting (at least in part) locally to achieve its analgesic effects. Nociceptive processing
in the STN would also be consistent with the nucleus’s role as part of the brain’s interrupt circuitry
(Jahanshahi et al., 2015), terminating behaviors that achieve negative outcomes, of which pain is a
clear example.
Therefore, the main objective of the present work was to characterize the link between STN and
nociception, answering the following questions:
Does the STN process nociceptive information? We explored the possibility that noxious stimula-
tion could induce nociceptive responses in the rat STN with in vivo electrophysiology.
Is the STN linked to a nociceptive network? We tested the potential role of the SC and PBN in
the transmission of nociceptive information to the STN, both physiologically and, in the case of
the PBN, anatomically.
Can manipulation of the integrity of the STN change nociceptive responses measured behavior-
ally? We tested STN-lesioned and sham-operated rats using a hotplate test.
Finally, to examine the hypothesis that STN dysfunction could underlie some of the pain symp-
toms observed in PD, we evaluated whether STN nociceptive responses were abnormal in a rat
model of PD.
We present convergent evidence that the STN is functionally linked to a nociceptive network and
that STN nociceptive responses are affected in Parkinsonism. The objectives above are summarized
in Figure 1.
Results
Nociceptive responses in STN
STN neurons
A total of 98 cells were recorded across the STN (Figure 2A). The STN neurons sampled in the pres-
ent study were characterized by a triphasic action potential in the majority of cases (n = 88, mean
duration = 2.1 ± 0.06 ms), the remaining cells having a biphasic action potential (n = 10, mean dura-
tion 1.58 ± 0.12 ms) (Figure 2B). The STN cells had a mean baseline firing rate of 7.39 Hz (± 0.53 Hz)
and exhibited various spontaneous patterns of activity such as an irregular pattern (n = 42, 43%), a
regular pattern (n = 26, 27%) and a bursting pattern (n = 20, 20%) (Figure 2C). The remaining cells
(n = 10, 10%) exhibited a mixture of these features. These electrophysiological characteristics are
concordant with those reported elsewhere in the literature in anesthetized rats (Hassani et al.,
1996; Kreiss et al., 1996; Hamani et al., 2004).
Phasic response
Following noxious stimulation performed on the contralateral hindpaw (120, 0.5 Hz), 19 STN cells
remained unresponsive (19%) whereas 79 STN neurons (81%) exhibited a phasic response to the
footshock with several patterns of response:
I.
Monophasic excitation (n = 42): the response consisted of a monophasic excitation. This type
of response could be subdivided into two categories according to their latencies and
durations:
1. Monophasic short/long (n = 20, Figure 3Aa): the cells exhibited a short-latency, long-
duration excitation.
2. Monophasic short/short (n = 17, Figure 3Ab): the cells exhibited a short-latency, short-
duration excitation.

 II.
Biphasic +/+ (n = 22, Figure 3Ac): the cells had an initial short-latency, short-duration excita-
tion followed by a longer-latency and longer-duration excitation.
III.
Biphasic +/- (n = 10, Figure 3Ad): the response in these cells had two phases, a short-
latency, short-duration excitation followed by an inhibition.
IV.
Triphasic +/-/+ (n = 5, Figure 3Ae): the response was characterized by an initial short-
latency, short-duration excitation, then an inhibition or a marked reduction in firing rate fol-
lowed by third late-latency and long-lasting excitation.
The remaining phasic responses could not be classified this way (n = 5).
The details of the latencies and durations of each response types can be found in Table 1 below:
A significantly larger number of non-responding cells were located in the caudal portion of STN
(c2 = 6.94, df = 2, p<0.05, Figure 2A). Of the 24 cells activated by noxious stimulation that were
tested for multi-modal responses, only three exhibited an excitation in response to non-noxious
somatosensory stimulation (light brush), hence the majority were nociceptive-only cells.
Baseline firing rate
The introduction of noxious stimulation induced a statistically significant increase in STN baseline fir-
ing rate (Wilcoxon test: W[97] = �1199; p=0.05; mean ± SEM: no noxious stimulation: 7.13 ± 0.51 Hz
vs
noxious
stimulation:
7.78
±
0.52
Hz).
However,
we
could
clearly
observe
some
cells
whose baseline firing rate decreased when the footshock was delivered (Figure 3B). We therefore
performed an individual analysis on each of the 98 STN cells, whether responding to the noxious
stimulation of not, to test whether the change of their baseline firing rate after the introduction of
the stimulation was statistically robust (Wilcoxon test, p<0.05), and if so, in which direction the
change took place. We identified 39 (40%) and 17 (18%) cells showing a significant increase (‘up’
group) and decrease (‘down’ group), respectively, in their baseline firing rate with the stimulation,
and no significant change for the remaining 42 cells (42%, ‘no change’ group). Contingency analysis
did not reveal a specific topography of their location within STN, or a link to the shape of their action
potential or to the presence or absence of a phasic response. Once grouped together in terms of
direction, the ‘up’ and ‘down’ groups both exhibited a statistically significant change in their base-
line firing rate. (Up — Wilcoxon test: W[38] = �780, p<0.001; mean ± SEM: no noxious stimulation
6.31 ± 0.83 Hz vs noxious stimulation 9.09 ± 0.94 Hz. Down — Wilcoxon test: W[16] = 153, p<0.001;
mean ±SEM: no noxious stimulation 9.55. ± 1.43 Hz vs noxious stimulation 7.08 ± 1.26 Hz), unlike the
‘no change’ group (Wilcoxon test: W[41] = 245, p = 0.1272; mean ±SEM: no noxious stimulation
6.92 ± 0.65 Hz vs noxious stimulation 6.85 ± 0.67 Hz). Interestingly, the spontaneous firing of STN
cells from the ‘down’ group had a significantly higher firing rate than that of the ‘up’ and ‘no change’
groups during the control period (Mann-Whitney test: U = 225, p<0.05; mean ± SEM: ‘up’
6.31 ± 0.83 Hz vs ‘down’ 9.55 ± 1.43 Hz, U = 261, p=0.05; mean ± SEM: ‘no change’ 6.919 ± 0.65 Hz
vs ‘down’ 9.55 ± 1.43 Hz), whereas the ‘up’ and ‘no change’ groups did not differ significantly. This
suggests the presence of a separate population of STN neurons that have a higher firing rate.
STN and nociceptive responses: is nociceptive information in the STN
functionally relevant?
To evaluate the involvement of STN in nociceptive responses, we tested nociceptive responses in
STN-lesioned and sham-operated rats behaviorally using a hot-plate test. The lesions were

 positioned within specific sub-regions of the STN, sparing the surrounding structures such as the
zona incerta or the hypothalamus located above and medial to the STN, respectively. The bi-lateral
STN lesions were localized in the posterior half (n = 6) or in the anterior/central (n = 6) parts of this
structure, covering from 8% to 34% of the total surface of both bilateral STN (mean ± SEM: 20 ±
2.4%) (Figure 4).
These partial and highly localized STN lesions affected the nociceptive responses of the rats.

Where does nociceptive information in the STN come from?
Nociceptive responses in afferent structures
Footshocks produced short-latency, short-duration excitatory responses in the SC and PBN (Table 2).
The PBN nociceptive responses were smaller in magnitude and amplitude than those in the SC.
Footshocks did not change the spontaneous baseline firing rate in the SC or the PBN (SC: t
[7] = 1.218; p=0.13; PBN: W = 8; number of pairs = 11; p=0.38). The latencies of the SC and PBN
responses to the stimulation were both significantly shorter than those of the STN (SC-STN: t
[15] = 2.88; p<0.001; mean ± SEM: SC 9 ± 0.8 ms vs STN 25.33 ± 5.27 ms; PBN-STN: t[22] = 3.34;
p<0.01; mean ±SEM: PBN 11.55 ± 1.35 ms vs STN 24.54 ± 3.13 ms). Given that the response to nox-
ious stimulation in SC and PBN occurs before that in the STN, both SC and PBN could be part of the
nociceptive afferent network directed at the STN.
Effect of SC or PBN inhibition on STN nociceptive responses
To test the possibility that the SC or PBN transmits nociceptive signals to the STN, we pharmacolog-
ically inhibited their neuronal activity with muscimol, a GABAA agonist, and evaluated the effect of
their temporary inactivation on STN nociceptive responses. Simultaneous recordings were made
from SC (multi-unit) and STN (single unit) neurons (n = 9) or from PBN (multi-unit) and STN (single
unit) neurons (n = 13) before and after the delivery of a noxious footshock.
Muscimol in the SC
The injection of muscimol adjacent to the SC electrode decreased the tonic activity in this structure
(t[7] = 4.31; p<0.001) and abolished the phasic responses altogether in three cases. In the remaining
cases, the muscimol produced a significant reduction of the magnitude (t[4] = 5.49; p<0.01) and the
maximum amplitude (t[4] = 3.18; p<0.05), as well as a trend towards the duration of the response (t
[4] = 1.74, p=0.08), but did not affect the latency (p=0.19). The depression of the SC neuronal activ-
ity by muscimol abolished STN nociceptive response in one case (1/9), and significantly reduced the
duration of STN nociceptive responses in the remaining cases (t[7] )= 3.27; p<0.05), with a trend
towards a decrease in magnitude, the difference being close to reaching the statistical threshold (t
[7] = 2.31; p=0.054). The remaining parameters of the response and the baseline firing rate of STN
cells were not statistically different to those in the pre-drug period.
Muscimol in the PBN
The injection of muscimol adjacent to the PBN electrode significantly decreased the tonic activity of
this structure (t[10] = 2.59; p<0.05) and abolished the phasic nociceptive responses in the PBN
altogether in two cases. In the remaining cases, the injection of muscimol increased the latencies (t
[8] = 3.12, p<0.01) and produced a significant reduction in the duration of the response (t[8] = 3.44,
p<0.01), the magnitude of response (t[8] = 2.88; p<0.01) and the maximum amplitude (t[8] = 3.91;
p<0.01). Unlike the SC, this general depression of PBN neuronal activity by muscimol completely
abolished nociceptive phasic responses in five STN cells (5/13, Figure 5) and significantly reduced
numerous parameters of the remaining STN responses to the stimulation, such as the duration (Wil-
coxon test: W = 31, number of pairs = 8, p<0.05), magnitude (t[7] = 4.25; p<0.01) and maximum
amplitude (t[7] = 3.21, p<0.01). Neither the latency (t[7] = 0.04, p=0.48, ns) nor the baseline firing
rate (t[12] = 0.19, p=0.42, ns) were significantly affected by the injection of muscimol in PBN.
These results show that PBN pharmacological blockade with muscimol is more effective at reduc-
ing STN phasic nociceptive responses.

 Effect of SC or PBN lesions on STN nociceptive responses
Suppression of SC activity by muscimol only had a small influence on STN phasic nociceptive
responses unlike PBN inactivation. However, while the technique of micro-injection offers a tempo-
rary inactivation with a possibility of recovery, the comparison of its effects on STN nociceptive
responses versus the effects following PBN injections could be affected by the fact that muscimol
was less effective at reducing SC phasic responses than those in the PBN, and by the difficulty of
evaluating the spread of the injection in the SC and PBN. Therefore, we tested the effect of ipsilat-
eral ibotenic acid lesions of the lateral part of the SC or PBN on STN phasic nociceptive responses.
SC lesion
In all cases (n = 5), the lesion included the lateral SC and extended, in some cases, to the adjacent
superficial and/or deep layers of this structure (Figure 6A and B). A total of 28 STN cells were
recorded in lesioned animals before and after noxious footshocks. Of these cells, 27 (94%) still
responded to the noxious stimulation. Analysis of the proportions of responding and non-respond-
ing cells comparing the control and SC-lesioned rats showed a significant difference between
the two groups (c2 = 2.98, df = 1, p<0.05), with a larger proportion of responding cells in SC-
lesioned rats compared to that in control animals (94% vs 81%). This correponded to a facilitation of
the occurrence of STN nociceptive responses after the removal of the lateral SC.
Analysis of the nociceptive-induced phasic responses in STN showed a close to significant reduc-
tion of the duration (Mann-Whitney, U = 85, p=0.06), which is consistent with the reduction of dura-
tion observed previously after the injection of muscimol in SC. A plot of the distribution of STN
responses according to their latency and duration in control and SC-lesioned animals shows that this
statistical tendency could be due to the loss of the longer-lasting nociceptive responses in SC-
lesioned animals (Figure 6C, dotted line box). This is supported by the observation of an increased
proportion of short-latency/short-duration response types and a decrease in the proportion of long-

the firing rate was statistically unaffected.
PBN lesion
The injection of ibotenic acid in the PBN induced a near total lesion of this structure in one case,
extending over 87% of the PBN. This lesion also affected a small part of the caudal pedunculopon-
tine nucleus. In the remaining cases, the lesion was only partial and affected between 30% to 60% of
this nucleus (Figure 7A and B).
A total of 30 STN cells were recorded in PBN-lesioned rats before and after noxious footshocks.
Although the lesion did not cover the entire PBN, the proportion of responding cells in the STN was
significantly reduced, with 15 cells (50%) still responding to the noxious stimulation while the other
15 (50%) did not respond. Analysis of the proportions of responding and non-responding cells com-
paring the control and PBN lesion rats showed a significant difference between the two groups
(c2 = 11.03, df = 1, p<0.001), with a larger proportion of non-responding cells in PBN-lesioned rats
than in control animals (50% vs 19%), representing a significant suppression of STN nociceptive
responses after the removal of the PBN. Analysis of the nociceptive-induced phasic responses in the
responding STN cells showed a significant reduction of response duration (Mann-Whitney, U = 378,
p=0.05), which is consistent with the reduction of duration previously observed after the injection of
muscimol in PBN. However, constrasting with the responses seen after the pharmacological block-
ade, the magnitude and maximum amplitude of the responses were not affected. As expected, the
latency and the baseline firing rates were not statistically different in the PBN-lesioned and control
rats.
A plot of the distribution of STN nociceptive responses according to their latency and duration in
control and PBN-lesioned animals shows that most types of response described in control rats

to the injection of muscimol, both the PBN (a, e, i) and STN (c, g, k) neurons were responsive to the footshock. Following the injection of muscimol into
the PBN, local neurons became less responsive (b, f) or unresponsive to the footshock (j) and so did the STN neurons (d, h, l). Note that PBN blockade
with muscimol abolished different STN response types such as bipolar +/– (a), monophasic short/short (g) and monophasic short/long (k).

and D).
Anatomical link between the PBN and the STN
Our electrophysiological experiments suggest that the PBN acts as a critical source of nociceptive
input into the STN and the SC as a critical modulator of those responses. While the connection
between the SC and the STN has been characterized previously (Coizet et al., 2009; Tokuno et al.,
1994), the functional link between the PBN and the STN was puzzling as a previous neuroanatomical
study characterizing afferent connections of the STN reported the absence of labeled terminals and
fibers in the STN following the injection of an anterograde tracer in the parabrachial complex
(Canteras et al., 1990). The characterization of PBN efferent connections has often focused on the
amygdala or the hypothalamus, but a close examination of PBN-related fiber pathways, especially to
the amygdala, indicates that those fibers are travelling close to (Saper and Loewy [1980]:
Figure 4F) or even partly within the STN (e.g. Bernard et al. [1989]: Figure 2J; Sarhan et al.
[2005]: Figure 9B3). Therefore, to better understand the anatomical basis of our electrophysiological
data, we re-evaluated the parabrachio-subthalamic pathway using a combination of anterograde
and retrograde tract-tracing techniques.
Anterograde tract-tracing
Injections of the anterograde tracers Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-l, n = 4) or biotinylated
dextran amine (BDA, n = 4) into the PBN revealed a robust direct projection to the ipsilateral STN
and a less substantial projection to the contralateral STN. The ipsilateral ascending fibers leave the
PBN in an antero-dorsal direction and pass above and through the dorso-caudal pedunculopontine
tegmental nucleus (Figure 8). There, they split into three large pathways (Figure 8A), a PBN-SC
(intermediate and deep layers), a PBN-thalamic and a PBN-nigral ventral projection. PBN-labeled

we
have
described
previously (Coizet et al., 2010) from the PBN to the dopaminergic neurons in the ventral midbrain,
the parabrachio-nigral pathway. A substantial number of fibers continue further forward to the
amygdala and the cortex (Figure 8A). This parabrachio-subthalamic pathway originates in the lateral
and medial PBN (lPBN and mPBN, respectively). Thus, injections of either PHA-l or BDA centered
preferentially on the lPBN or the mPBN were both associated with numerous labeled axons and ter-
minals, which were differentially distributed within sub-regions of the STN. PBN fibers and terminals
were largely seen in a dorsal sheet that extended across the entire mediolateral axis of the STN
(Figure 8B and C). Moving rostrally, they further spread across the dorsoventral area of the STN.
Many anterogradely labeled boutons were located in the vicinity of labeled fibers (Figure 8B and C).
Retrograde track tracing. To identify the regional distribution and morphology of the parabra-
chio-subthalamic projection neurons, we injected small quantities of the retrograde tracers Fluoro-
gold (n = 4) or Cholera toxin subunit B (CTB, n = 2) into the STN. The projection to the STN
exhibited little topography. Retrogradely labeled neurons were found in all subnuclei of both the
ipsilateral and contralateral PBN, and also within the fibers of the superior cerebellar peduncle (cp)
(Figure 9A and B). The density of the labeled cells was however significantly larger on the ipsilateral
side, as confirmed by a three factor (Side: ipsilateral/contralateral; Level: AP 8.8/AP 9.3/AP 9.8; Sub-
divisions: lateral/medial/cp) repeated-measures ANOVA (Side factor: F = 9.33, df = 1, p<0.05), and
varied within the PBN according to the AP level (interaction between the level and the subdivisions,
F = 4.10, df = 4, p<0.05). The density of the cells increased in the lateral PBN when moving rostrally
and the majority of the cells in the mPBN were located in the posterior PBN. PBN neurons
that were retrogradelly labeled by STN injections were small to medium-sized (mean ± SEM:
229.25 ± 8.21 mm2, range from 102.1 to 681.10 mm2; n = 184) with a majority of round (59%) and
bipolar (35%) soma and some multipolar cell bodies (6%) (Figure 9C).
STN nociceptive responses in a rat model of Parkinson’s disease
In a classical rat model of PD induced by an injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), a
neurotoxin thattargets dopaminergic neurons (DA), in the SNc, we tested whether STN nociceptive
responses were dysfunctional.

 TH immunohistochemistry was used to assess the extent of the dopamine denervation induced
by 6-OHDA in the DA-lesioned rats. TH-labeled neurons on the lesioned side were reduced to an
average of 6.13 ± 0.71% (mean ± SEM) of those on the unlesioned side, with the remaining neurons
located in the medial part of the SNc. The reduced number of dopaminergic cells led to an average
decrease of 65.22 ± 2.08% in the dopaminergic innervation of the striatum.
Totals of 34 and 43 cells were recorded in the control and DA-lesioned rats, respectively. As
expected in a model of PD, STN cells had a significantly higher firing rate in DA-lesioned rats com-
pared to controls (mean ± SEM: control = 8.00 ± 1.04 ms; DA-lesioned = 12.96 ± 2.02 ms; p<0.05,
Figure 3A). STN responses to nociceptive stimulation were abnormal in the DA-lesioned group.
Analysis revealed that STN cells in PD rats exhibited significantly longer responses (mean ± SEM:
control = 84.39 ± 16.75 ms; DA-lesioned = 175.38 ± 39.85 ms, p<0.05) with a greater amplitude
(mean ± SEM: control = 27.81 ± 3.58 ms; DA-lesioned = 40.88 ± 5.91 ms; p<0.05, Figure 3C) and

 baseline firing rate upon introduction of the stimulation (up, down or no change) was not altered in
the PD rat groups (c2 = 0.32; p=0.85). Therefore, STN phasic nociceptive responses in PD rats were
exacerbated, while the tonic modulation of the firing rate was preserved.
Discussion
The present study demonstrates for the first time that a large majority of STN neurons exhibit vari-
ous mono- or multi-phasic responses to noxious stimulation, consistent with the hypothesis that one
of the functions of the STN is to interrupt behavior when appropriate (Jahanshahi et al., 2015); in
this case, to select a more appropriate action to try to relieve the noxious sensation. STN nociceptive
responses mainly had a short latency (~20–40 ms) and could be recorded all over the structure. We
have shown that most of the responsive cells are nociceptive-specific, as only few of them
also respond to non-noxious somatosensory stimulation. In addition, we found that we could differ-
entiate
three

of
STN
neurons,
which
showed
an
increase,
a
decrease
or
no
change, respectively, in their baseline firing rate upon introduction of the noxious stimulation. The
spontaneous firing rate of STN ‘down’ cells was significantly higher than that of the two other
groups, suggesting the possibility of a separate group of cells. Furthermore, we have shown that
STN responses to nociceptive stimuli were abnormal in a rat model of PD, suggesting that the noci-
ceptive responses recorded in STN depend on the integrity of the nigrostriatal DA system.
When determining the afferent source of nociception-related influence on STN activity, we have
revealed a crucial role for two brainstem structures, the PBN and the SC, by demonstrating the
effects of their inactivation on nociceptive responses in the STN and also by highlighting the exis-
tence of an anatomical direct pathway from the PBN to the STN. This parabrachio-subthalamic pro-
jection represents a second example of a subcortical hyperdirect pathway to the STN from a sensori-
motor structure, in addition to the tecto-subthalamic pathway described previously (Coizet et al.,
2009; Tokuno et al., 1994). Finally, we have shown that these anatomico-electrophysiological find-
ings translate into a functional role for the STN in mediating nociception, in that nociceptive behav-
ioral responses were affected by lesions of the STN. However, a note of caution is required since we
used only male rats, and thus care should be taken in extrapolating our results to females.
Using noxious electrical stimulation of the hindpaw allowed us to record precisely the timing of
responses in our structures of interest with controlled parameters of stimulation. It is interesting to
note that the majority of STN nociceptive responses had short latencies (76/79) and were monopha-
sic (40/79), a pattern of responses that is similar in proportion to the pattern of STN responses fol-
lowing visual stimulation (Coizet et al., 2009) but dissimilar to the pattern of STN responses
following stimulation of the frontal (Magill et al., 2004), sensorimotor (Fujimoto and Kita, 1993) or
motor cortex (Kolomiets et al., 2001). The latter — in the majority of cases — are multi-phasic, with
two excitatory phases (equivalent to the present biphasic +/+) often separated by an inhibition
(equivalent to the present triphasic +/–/+). It has been hypothesized previously (Magill et al., 2004;
Kitai and Deniau, 1981) that the short latency excitation following cortical stimulation appears to
be driven by a hyperdirect pathway to the STN,whereas the later phases of the response arise from
polysynaptic interactions, which are manifested more slowly. The inhibition following the first excita-
tion has been hypothesized to involve the reciprocally connected STN–globus pallidus (GP) network
(Fujimoto and Kita, 1993). STN excitation may activate GP GABAergic neurons, which in return
inhibit the STN. Overall, our data suggest that when the rat is subjected to noxious stimulation, the
main pathway to the STN that is activated is a fast hyperdirect pathway, originating in part in the
PBN. The fact that we only have a few cells showing an inhibitory second phase (10 biphasic and 5
triphasic, 15/79) indicates that STN nociceptive cells are rarely closely connected to the GP and lack
GP-STN feedforward control.
Functionally antagonistic STN neuronal subpopulations have been found in the STN. Specific GO
and STOP cells have been described in PD patients performing a stop signal paradigm, during
motor execution or response inhibition, respectively (Benis et al., 2016). Sub-populations of STN
cells have also been shown to code exclusively for reward magnitude (4% vs 32% sucrose
[Lardeux et al., 2009]), error-related activity (‘Oops neurons’ [Lardeux et al., 2009]), reward value
(cocaine or sucrose [Lardeux et al., 2013]) and for positive and aversive reinforcers (Breysse et al.,
2015).

 A major finding of our work is that we were able to differentiate a subpopulation of STN neurons
that had a higher spontaneous firing rate on the basis of the effect of noxious stimuli on general
tonic activity. This finding is important as glutamatergic tone from the STN is likely to have a strong
impact on the tonic level of activity in the basal ganglia network, especially in the output structures
(as we hypothesized that nociceptive-responding STN cells may not be densely connected to GP).
The results from previous computational studies (Gurney et al., 2001) suggest that tonic control by
the STN may adjust the general level of activity of the inhibitory GABAergic neurons of the basal
ganglia output structures, which are known to project to the SC and PBN (Schneider, 1986;
Deniau and Chevalier, 1992). This tonic STN control is hypothesized to be used by the basal
ganglia to optimize selection of the most appropriate action. The identification of separate subpo-
pulations of cells in the STN according to their spontaneous firing rate, and the orientation of the
change of their firing rate following the occurrence of noxious stimulation,suggests that the tonic
excitatory effects of the STN may not be uniform, although further work is required to elucidate the
connectivity of the STN subpopulations. This mechanism is important in the context of PD in which
STN activity is pathologically increased (Bergman et al., 1994; Albin et al., 1995), probably disrupt-
ing this control. This possibility is further supported by our results showing enhanced phasic nocicep-
tive responses in a PD rat model, with an increase in the latency to make nocifensive responses in
the hotplate test following lesions of the STN. As well as interfering with action selection, disrupted
STN control in PD would probably have an impact on the SC and PBN and their role in sensory signal
processing.
In addition to demonstrating that STN neurons process nociceptive information, we also assessed
whether two subcortical sensori-motor structures from the brain stem transmit nociceptive signals to
the STN. Despite SC nociceptive responses having shorter latencies than those of STN neurons to
the same stimulus, chemical suppression and lesions of SC had relatively minor effects on the
responses of STN to noxious footshock. Lesions of the SC with acid ibotenic reduced the number of
cells that do not respond to noxious stimulation, suggesting that the SC gates the pool of respond-
ing cells in the STN. Our previous work has demonstrated that the SC is a critical relay for short-
latency visual input into DA neurons (Dommett et al., 2005) but not for short-latency nociceptive
input (Coizet et al., 2006) transmitted by the PBN (Coizet et al., 2010). The current results suggest
the same organization when considering visual and nociceptive input into the STN. The SC is a cru-
cial structure to transmit visual information while the PBN strongly contributes to the relay of noci-
ceptive signals. PBN lesions significantly reduced the number of STN cells responding to noxious
stimuli, sparing a group of cells with short latency short duration responses (Figure 7C),

(Dostrovsky, 2000a). This nociceptive network linked to the STN is the probable substrate underly-
ing the successful analgesic effects of STN deep-brain stimulation. Kim et al. (2012) hypothesized
that STN-DBS improves secondary pain symptoms in PD because this stimulation decreases the
abnormally increased muscle tone in patients and may alleviate the primary nociception processing
in the central nervous system. DBS effects are complex and despite the success of DBS in treating a
variety of psychiatric and neurological disorders, the mechanisms underpinning its therapeutic effi-
cacy remain unclear (McIntyre et al., 2004; Ashkan et al., 2017). DBS is hypothesized to induce a
‘functional lesion’ of the STN (Follett, 2000), via depolarization blockade and synaptic inhibition
(Beurrier et al., 2001; Dostrovsky et al., 2000b), which would lead to a suppression of the activity
of STN neurons. We hypothesize that these mechanisms would reduce the pathologically increased
firing rate in the STN in PD (and thus the pain symptoms), as well as nociceptive responses.
Our current work using anterograde tract-tracing neuroanatomy coupled with 3D reconstruction
indicates that a small ascending bundle leaves the PBN and then splits into three massive projections
traveling toward the SC, the thalamus and the SNc/STN. Some fibers from this last ascending path-
way continue rostrally to terminate in the amygdala and the cortex. Comparison of the size of the
bundle leaving the PBN and the size of the bundles traveling to their targets indicate that the num-
ber of labelled fibers clearly increase, suggesting that PBN axons have collaterals. This PBN-STN
projection is possibly interconnected with other PBN efferents, such as the PBN–amygdala projec-
tion, which partly travels through the STN and has cells of origin that are of a similar type to those of
the PBN cells projecting to STN (Sarhan et al., 2005). With a DBS effect on axons and fibers
(Chiken and Nambu, 2014), the characterization of this projection and network are important in the
context of the effects of STN-DBS on pain symptoms. Overall, STN-DBS would not only impact STN

 and PBN nociceptive processing but would also modulate PBN-amygdala fibers and possibly other
PBN efferents via the collaterals. The effect of STN-DBS would therefore impact many aspects of
pain such as, for example, pain-related emotional reactions when activating the PBN-amygdaloid
connection or neuroendocrine homeostatic regulation in response to pain by activating the PBN-
hypothalamic pathway (Gauriau and Bernard, 2002). Further experiments are now needed to fully
characterize the effect of STN-DBS on nociceptive processing in our rat models and how aspects of
that network are modulated to achieve a DBS-related analgesic effect.
Pain is a multifaceted experience that can be understood in terms of somatosensory, affective
and cognitive dimensions. DBS therapies that are focused on a single facet of pain, originally target-
ing somatosensory networks or more recently targeting affective regions (Schneider, 1986). The
STN is a small structure with functional territories such as the limbic, cognitive and sensory, in close
proximity to each other. This would allow the potential modulation of different modalities of pain
and, in the future, the best placements of DBS electrodes within those territories would have to be
tested to maximize the analgesic effect. Finally, numerous non-motor symptoms can worsen or
improve depending on the electrical stimulation parameters, as well as the location of the electrode
(Kim et al., 2015). The best parameters of stimulation for nociception would need to take into
account the effect of those parameters on other symptoms of PD.
Finally, non-neuropathic pain, recently recognized as a frequent and disabling symptom in PD, is
a complaint affecting many patients who have numerous neurodegenerative disease such as Alz-
heimer’s disease and other dementias, motor neuron disease, Huntington’s disease, spinocerebellar
ataxia and spinal muscular atrophy (de Tommaso et al., 2016). Our findings on the involvement of
the STN in nociceptive processing and its link to a nociceptive network open a new direction for
research to explore a possible role of this structure in other pain syndromes, especially extra-pyrami-
dal ones like Huntington’s disease, which is characterized by a dysfunction of the basal ganglia. It
also opens up the possibility of developing therapeutic strategies using DBS. A variety of brain sites
have been identified for chronic stimulation procedures to attenuate pain (Davis et al., 1998). These
targets include the thalamus, the periventricular gray nucleus, the cingulate cortex and the motor
cortex (Gorecki et al., 1989; Davis et al., 1998). With the involvement of the STN in a nociceptive
network as demonstrated in our work, the STN-DBS technique can thus be considered in the future
as a new target for the treatment of pain not only in pharmaco-resistant patients suffering from pre-
viously described neurodegenerative disease, but also, for example, in those with chronic pain dis-
ease or pharmaco-resistant patients with certain forms of migraine that have been shown to activate
the STN (Schwedt et al., 2014).

Animals
Fifty male Hooded Lister rats (265–450 g) were anaesthetised with an intra-peritoneal injection of
urethane (ethyl carbonate; 1.25 g/kg as a 25% aqueous solution) and mounted in a stereotaxic frame
with the skull level. Body temperature was maintained at 37˚C with a thermostatically controlled
heating blanket. Two stainless steel electrodes (E363-1, Plastics One, Roanoke, VA) were inserted
into the left hindpaw, one under the skin of the plantar surface of the foot and the other under the
skin of the medial aspect of the lower leg/ankle. Craniotomies were then performed to allow access
to the STN and SC or PBN. In accordance with the policy of Lyon1 University and the Grenoble Insti-
tut des Neurosciences (GIN) and with French legislation, experiments were performed in compliance
with the European Community Council Directive of November 24, 1986 (86/609/EEC). The research

 STN recordings
Extracellular single unit recordings were made from STN neurons located contralaterally to the stim-
ulated hindpaw, using glass microelectrodes pulled via a vertical electrode puller (Narashige Labora-
tory Instruments Ltd. Tokyo, Japan) and broken back to a tip diameter of approximately 1 mm
(impedances 5–20 MW, measured at 135 Hz in 0.9% NaCl). Electrodes were filled with 0.5 M saline
and 2% Pontamine Sky Blue (BDH Chemicals Ltd., Poole, UK). The electrode was lowered into the
STN (3.6–4.16 mm caudal to bregma, 2.0–3.0 mm lateral to midline, 6.8–8.20 mm ventral to the
brain surface according to the atlas [Paxinos and Watson, 2005]) with a hydraulic microdrive (Trent
Wells Inc.). The STN electrode was lowered until a putative STN neuron was identified on the basis
of several criteria as follows. i) the pattern of activity while lowering the electrode, which was as fol-
lows: an initial absence of activity corresponding to the medial lemniscus fibre track, followed shortly
after by large-amplitude, fast-bursty neurons located in zona incerta, and then a second absence of
action potentials. The return of activity corresponded to the STN. ii) STN firing rate between 8.5 and
14.7 Hz (Hassani et al., 1996; Kreiss et al., 1996). iii) STN firing pattern described as irregular or
bursting (Hamani et al., 2004).
SC/PBN recording and muscimol experiments
Extracellular multiunit recordings were made simultaneously from the SC or PBN ipsilateral to the
STN recording electrode using a tungsten electrode coupled to a 30-gauge stainless steel injector
filled with muscimol (0.25 mg/ml in saline, Sigma-Aldrich). An angled approach was used in the PBN,
with the electrode tilted caudally by 35˚, entering the brain at 11.4 mm caudal to bregma and 1.9–
2.0 mm lateral to midline. PBN was encountered 5.2–5.8 mm below the brain surface. In a second
group of rats, the electrode/injector assembly was introduced vertically into the SC (AP: 6.2–6.5
mm, bregma; ML: 2.1–2.2 mm, bregma; DV: 4.2–4.5 mm, brain surface). The electrode/injector
assembly was lowered into the SC into the lateral part of the deep layers of the SC, known to project
to the STN (Coizet et al., 2009).
Microinjections were made (0.5 ml at a rate of 0.5 ml/min) via a 10 ml Hamilton syringe mounted
on an infusion pump, connected to the injector by a length of plastic tubing. Extracellular voltage
excursions were amplified, band-pass filtered (300 Hz–10 kHz), digitized at 10 kHz and recorded
directly onto computer disc using a Micro 1401 data acquisition system (Cambridge Electronic
Design [CED] Systems, Cambridge, UK) running CED data capture software (Spike 2).
Stimulation procedure
As previously described (Coizet et al., 2006, 2010), PBN and SC neurons were identified by their
response to noxious footshocks induced by single pulses (0.5 Hz, 2 ms duration) at an intensity of
5.0 mA. The activity of the cells (single unit in STN and multiunit activity in the PBN or SC) was
recorded during a control period (120 trials of sham stimulation) and during the application of nox-
ious footshocks (120 trials). For the muscimol experiments, an injection of muscimol was made into
the PBN or SC. Typically, a change in local SC/PBN multiunit activity was seen within 60–120 s of the
injection. Noxious electrical footshock stimulation was applied throughout this period, until either
the effects of the drug wore off in the SC/PBN, or the STN cell was lost. After a complete trial, fur-
ther STN neurons were tested in the same way. Between 1 and 5 STN cells were tested in a single
subject.
Nociceptive nature of the stimulation
The electrical stimulation parameters from 3 to 5 mA have previously been shown to be approxi-
mately three times the threshold for activating C-fiber (Chang and Shyu, 2001; Matthews and Dick-
enson, 2001; Carpenter et al., 2003), to produce reliable Ad and C-fiber responses in the
anesthetized rat spinal cord (Urch et al., 2003) and to produce c-fos expression in the nociceptive
superficial lamina of the spinal cord (Coizet et al., 2006). They also activate the SC (Coizet et al.,
2006), the PBN (Coizet et al., 2010) and the dopaminergic neurons (Coizet et al., 2006; 2010) in a
qualitatively similar way as a mechanical noxious pinch with a teethed forceps.
To ascertain the noxious nature of our stimulation, we performed three control tests based on
the previous observations. i) We first performed an intensity test on a group of STN cells following
footshocks with intensities ranging from 0 to 5 mA. Among the 17 STN neurons responding to the
Pautrat et al. eLife 2018;7:e36607. DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.36607

Neuroscience
 maximum 5 mA stimulation, a decrease of intensity was followed by a decrease of the number of
responding cells following a 4 mA (n = 12) and a 3 mA (n = 7) stimulation. None of those cells
showed a response for intensities under the threshold of 3 mA (Figure 10A, supplementary results).
Furthermore, analysis performed on the 7 cells responding to 3, 4 and 5 mA showed a significant
effect of the intensity of the stimulation when considering the maximum amplitude (ANOVA –
repeated measure: F[2,20] = 11.51, p<0.01) and the magnitude (ANOVA – repeated measure: F
[2,20] = 17.55, p<0.001). In both cases, there was a significant increase in the response parameters
with the increase in the intensity (Tukey-Kramer post-hoc comparison — maximum amplitude: 3 mA
vs 5 mA, p<0.01, 4mA vs 5 mA, p<0.05; magnitude: 3 mA vs 4 mA, p<0.05; 3 mA vs 5 mA,
p<0.001). ii) We compared the effects of a mechanical pinch with a teethed forceps and a 5 mA foot-
shock on STN neuron responses. All the cells responding to the manual pinch showed a qualitatively
similar excitation to the footshock (Figure 10B, supplementary results), while none of the cells
that were unresponsive to pinch were activated by footshock. iii) As previously reported
(Coizet et al., 2006, 2010), noxious footshock of 5mA for an hour induced the expression of c-fos
labeling within the medial part of the ipsilateral superficial layers of the lumbar cord, especially layers
I and II, although layers III–V also contained some labeling. In control animals, where electrodes
were implanted but the stimulation was not delivered, substantially lower levels of c-fos were
observed (Figure 10A). These results confirm that the footshock used in the present study was activ-
ating nociceptive elements in the lumbar spinal cord (Besson and Chaouch, 1987; Almeida et al.,
2004) consistent with known somatotopic representations of the hindfoot; that is primary afferents
from the foot terminate medially (Swett and Woolf, 1985).
Histology and analysis
The position of SC and PBN recording sites were marked with a small lesion caused by passing 10
mA DC current for 2.5 min through the tungsten recording electrode. The final recording site for the
STN recording electrode was marked by passing a constant cathodal current of 27.5 mA (constant
current source) through the electrode for a period of 30 min to eject Pontamine Sky Blue. Animals
were then killed by an overdose of pentobarbital and perfused with 0.9% saline followed by 4%
paraformaldehyde. Brains were removed and postfixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4˚C,
before being transferred into sucrose for 36 hr. Serial coronal (30 mm) sections were cut, mounted
on slides and processed with a Nissl stain (Cresyl Violet). Once sections had been processed, record-
ing sites were reconstructed onto sections taken from the atlas of Paxinos and Watson (2005).
Peri-stimulus time interval histograms (PSTHs) were constructed based on SC/PBN multi-unit (bin
width 1 ms) and STN single-unit data (bin width 10 ms). PSTHs were imported into an Excel program
(Peter Furness, University of Sheffield; Coizet et al., 2006, 2009, 2010; Dommett et al., 2005),
which determined the following response characteristics. (i) Baseline activity: the mean number of
single multi-unit events during the 500 ms bins prior to the footshock. (ii) Response latency: the
latency of a visually evoked response was marked as the point when the value of post-stimulation
events exceeded 1.96 S.D. of the baseline mean. (iii) Response duration: response offset was
recorded when post-stimulation activity returned to a value 1.96 S.D. of the baseline mean. iii)
Amplitude of the response: the maximum amplitude during the response. (iv) Magnitude of the
response: the mean number of single multi-unit events between response onset and offset minus
the baseline mean.
Lesion procedure in SC and PBN
Fourteen rats received a unilateral ibotenic acid lesion of the SC or the PBN. Each rat was anesthe-
tized with isofluorane (5% for the induction and 1–2% for maintenance) and placed in a stereotaxic
instrument. A 30-gauge metal injector needle filled with ibotenic acid (20 mg/ml in phosphate buff-
ered saline) was introduced using the same coordinates as for the electrophysiological procedure.
The injections in the PBN were made according to a previously published procedure by Reilly and
Trifunovic (2000, 2001) with electrophysiological guidance to improve the accuracy of the location
of the lesion. The microinjections were made (0.5 ml/min) in the SC (0.5–0.65 ml) and the PBN (0.3–
0.5 ml) as for the muscimol injections (see above). The cannula remained in situ for a further 10 min
to minimize the spread of neurotoxin back along the track before the cannula was removed and the
incision was closed.

 Lesion procedure in STN and hotplate test
Twenty Long Evans rats were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/Kg, s.c., Imalge
` ne 1000, Merial,
Lyon, France) and medetomidine (0.85 mg/Kg, s.c., Domitor, Orion Pharma, Espoo, Finland). Rats
were secured in Kopf stereotaxic apparatus. Then, a unilateral 30-gauge stainless-steel injector nee-
dle connected by Tygon tubing (Saint Gobain performance plastics) with a 10 mL Hamilton microsyr-
inge (Bonaduz, Switzerland) fixed on a micropump (CMA, Kista, Sweden) was positioned into the
STN. Coordinates for the aimed site were (with tooth bar set at �3.3 mm): anteposterior �3.72 mm;
lateral ±2.4 mm from bregma; dorsoventral �8.4 mm from skull (Paxinos and Watson, 2005). Rats
received a bilateral injection of either ibotenic acid (9.4 mg/mL, AbCam Biochemical, Cambridge, UK;
STN-lesioned group, n = 12) or vehicle solution (phosphate buffer, 0.1M; Sham control group,
n = 8). The volume injected was 0.5 mL per side infused over 3 min. The injectors were left in place
for 3 min to allow diffusion. At the end of surgery, medetomidine was reversed by 0.2 mg (4.28 mg/
Kg, s.c.) atipamezole (Antisedan, Orion Pharma, Espoo, Finland). Three weeks after the surgery, all
the animals were subjected to the hotplate test. Each rat was placed on a heated metal plate (53˚)
surrounded by a transparent cylinder. The experimenter was constantly watching the rat’s behaviour
during the test to measure the latency of the first sign of paw licking or jumping and to remove the
animals from the apparatus quickly. The maximum time on the hot place was set to 30 s. The rat’s
behaviour was also video recorded online on the computer for a second finer analysis.
6-OHDA lesions
Rats were anesthetised with an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine-xylazine (0.765/1.1
ml; 1 ml/kg, i.p.) and placed in a stereotaxic frame with the skull level. All the microinjections were
made via a sharpened 30G injection cannula connected with polyethylene tubing to a 10 ml Hamilton
syringe driven by an infusion pump (0.5 ml/min). After the injection, the cannula was left in place for
a further 5 min to allow diffusion. Animals were divided into two groups: i) those with a total dopa-
minergic lesion (n = 9), in which 3 ml of 6-OHDA (Sigma-Aldrich, 3 mg/ml in sterile 0.9% NaCl and
0.1% ascorbic acid) was injected into the left SNc using the following stereotaxic coordinates: AP:
+3.0 mm; ML:+2.1 mm and DV:+2.4 mm from interaural zero mm; and ii) a control group with no
injection of the toxin (n = 9).
The extent of the DA denervation following the 6-OHDA injections in the SNc was determined
using tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry. To reveal TH, the sections were washed and
incubated in a blocking solution containing 0.1M PB with 0.3% of triton X-100 (TX), 2.5% of Bovine
Serum Albumin (BSA) and 5% normal horse serum (NHS) for 2 hr before being transferred overnight
to a 0.1M PB-TX 0.3% with 1% BSA and 2% NHS containing the primary mouse monoclonal TH anti-
body, diluted 1:3,000 (Chemicon, Hampshire, UK). The following day, sections were washed in 0.1M
PB and incubated with the secondary antibody, biotinylated antimouse made in horse (in a dilution
of 1:1,000 in 0.1M PB-TX 0.3% with 2% NHS) for 2 hr. Following further washes in 0.1M PB, the sec-
tions were exposed to the elite Vectastain ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA)
diluted 1:100 in PB-TX 0.3%, for 2 hr. Again following washes in 0.1M PB, immunoreactivity was
revealed by exposure to VIP (Vector Laboratories) for 2 min, which produced a purple reaction prod-
uct. Sections were then mounted onto gelled slides, dehydrated through alcohols and cleared in
xylene before being coverslipped with DPX. TH-immunolabelling of DA neurons and terminals was
evaluated using a light microscope (Nikon, Eclipse 80i, TRIBVN, Chatillon, France) coupled to the
ICS Framework computerized image analysis system (TRIBVN, 2.9.2 version, Chatillon, France). For
quantification, TH-labeled coronal sections of SNc (AP �5.3 mm to �5.8 mm from Bregma) and stria-
tum (AP 0.20 mm to �0.30 mm from bregma) were digitized using a Pike F-421C camera (ALLIED
Vision Technologies Stradtroda, Germany). Optical densities (OD) were measured for the dener-
vated and non-denervated territories of the lesioned animals for each section and were compared to
those in the homologous regions of the sham-operated animals.

 Statistics
The statistical reliability of differences between response latencies for the SC/PBN and STN, and
comparisons of response duration, amplitude and magnitude before and after SC/PBN injections of
muscimol was made using parametric (ANOVA, t-test) or non-parametric (Wilcoxon, Mann-Whitney)
statistical tests according to the normality of the data. STN baseline firing rate change before and
after the noxious stimulation was assessed during the 500 ms before the sham and noxious stimula-
tions. The data were imported in MATLAB, bined and compared using a Wilcoxon test. STN firing
pattern was also assessed using MATLAB according to the methodology developed by Piallat et al.
(2011). Neurons were classified as irregular, regular or bursting according to the interspike distribu-
tions and autocorrelograms. Burst activity showed a wide or bimodal interval interspike distribution
and a significant single peak on the autocorrelation function. Irregular activity was characterised by a
wide interval interspike distribution and a flat autocorrelogram. Regular activity was characterised by
a narrow interval interspike distribution and an autocorrelogram with multiple regular peaks.
Anatomy
Animals
We used 14 male Long Evans rats (350–460 g, Janvier, France). Animals were anaesthetised with an
intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of Ketaset (0.765 ml/kg) and Rompun (1.1 ml/kg).
Anterograde experiment
Single injections of the anterograde tracers biotinylated dextran amine (BDA: Sigma-Aldrich) or Pha-
seolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L: Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, UK) were made into the
PBN. An angled approach was used as previously described (Coizet et al., 2010). BDA (10% in
phosphate buffer; PB) was pressure ejected in volumes of 30–90 nl via a glass micropipette (20 mm
diameter tip) using a compressed air injection system, while PHA-L was ejected iontophoretically
(5mA anodal current applied to a 2.5% solution in PB, 7 s on/off for 15–20 min).
Retrograde experiment
Small (10–20 nl) pressure injections of the retrograde tracers Cholera toxin subunit B (CTB, 1% solu-
tion in phosphate buffer) or the fluorescent tracer Fluorogold (FG, 4% in distilled water) were made
into the STN. After allowing 7 days for the transport of tracers, animals were re-anesthetised with
pentobarbitane and perfused transcardially. The brains were placed immediately in 4% PFA over-
night before being cryoprotected by immersion in sucrose solution (20% in 0.1 M PB) for at least 36
hr. Three series of coronal or sagittal sections (30 mm) were cut on a freezing microtome and col-
lected in 0.1 M PB for further immunohistochemistry processing, except for tissue containing FG
where one series was collected directly onto slides, allowed to dry in a light protected box and cov-
erslipped with DPX mountant.
Histology
To reveal the tracers (BDA, PHA-L, CTB), free-floating sections were washed with 0.1 M PB followed
by 0.1 M PB containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (PB-TX) for 30 min. For animals injected with PHA-L or
CTB, the sections were incubated overnight in primary antibody solution (goat anti-PHA-L, 1:1,000
dilution, Vector, or goat anti-CTB, 1:4,000 dilution, Quadratech). The next day, sections were
washed with PB-TX and incubated for 2 hr in biotinylated rabbit anti-goat IgG (1:100, Vector, in PB-
TX containing 2% normal rabbit serum). After 30 min washing, all the sections were incubated in
Elite Vectastain ABC reagent (Vector, 1:100 in PB-TX) for 2 hr. The peroxidase associated with the
tracers was revealed by reacting tissue with H2O2 for approximately 1 min using nickel-enhanced
diaminobenzidine (DAB) as the chromogen for BDA and CTB (black reaction product) and using
nickel-free DAB for PHA-L (brown reaction product). Finally, sections were washed in PB, mounted
on gelatine-coated slides, dehydrated in graded dilutions of alcohol, cleared in xylene and cover-
slipped in DPX.
Analysis
Following injections of anterograde tracers into the PBN, three coronal sections through the STN
separated by ~0.5 mm (equivalent to �3.6, –3.8 and �4.1 mm caudal to bregma in the atlas of

 Paxinos and Watson (2005) or three sagittal sections (equivalent to 1.9, 2.4 and 2.9 lateral to
bregma) were selected for analysis. Sections of interest were digitized using a light microscope
(Nikon, Eclipse 80i, TRIBVN, 2.9.2 version, Chatillon, France) coupled to the ICS Framework comput-
erized image analysis system (TRIBVN, 2.9.2 version, Chatillon, France) and a Pike F-421C camera
(ALLIED Vision Technologies Stradtroda, Germany).
The location of retrogradely labelled cells was plotted on four coronal sections through the PBN
separated by ~0.5 mm (equivalent to �8.8, –9.3, �9.8 caudal to bregma). A series of digital images
(magnification 10 X) were taken and imported into a graphics program (Macromedia Freehand)
where they were montaged. The borders and layers of the PBN were drawn over the montage. The
location of anterogradely labelled axons and terminals was plotted on sagittal sections from 1.9 to
2.9 lateral from bregma. Fibres and terminals associated with the injections were traced with the aid
of a pen tablet (intuos) with a microscope equipped with a camera lucida and a graphics program
(Microsoft PowerPoint). By focusing on different depths in the brain sections, it was possible to pro-
duce a drawing that contained all labelled elements in the section.
For the 3D reconstruction, the most representative example was selected and series of sagittal sec-
tions containing PBN and STN were digitized using a light microscope (Nikon, Eclipse 80i, TRIBVN,
2.9.2 version, Chatillon, France) coupled to the ICS Framework computerized image analysis system
(TRIBVN, 2.9.2 version, Chatillon, France) and a Pike F-421C camera (ALLIED Vision Technologies
Stradtroda, Germany). Digitized images were converted into a .tiff format and individually exported
into Adobe Photoshop to create individual .tiff files with the same dimensions. A stack of 2D sagittal
sections was then created using Cygwin (Cygwin TM sources) and IMOD package software (Boulder
laboratory for 3D Electron Microscopy of Cells, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO) (Kremer et al.,
1996). As previously described (Coizet et al., 2017; Mailly et al., 2010), sections were aligned with
the Midas program from IMOD using manual rigid body transformations. The stack was opened in
IMOD, where the structures of interest were delineated including the PBN, SNr/SNc, STN, and SC.
The injection site and individual ascending labelled axons were drawn in IMOD directly on the digi-
tized images. This process also created a 3D reconstruction of ascending fibers.
