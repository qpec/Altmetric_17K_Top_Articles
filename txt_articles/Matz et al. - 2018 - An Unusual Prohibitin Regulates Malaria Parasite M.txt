In Brief
Matz et al. present an experimental
genetics study of an unusual prohibitin-
like protein in the malaria parasite and
find that it regulates mitochondrial
membrane polarity. Ablation of this
protein causes almost complete
mitochondrial depolarization in the
mosquito vector, which, in turn, leads to a
block in malaria parasite transmission.

SUMMARY
Proteins of the stomatin/prohibitin/flotillin/HfIK/C
(SPFH) family are membrane-anchored and perform
diverse cellular functions in different organelles.
Here, we investigate the SPFH proteins of the murine
malaria model parasite Plasmodium berghei, the
conserved prohibitin 1, prohibitin 2, and stomatin-
like protein and an unusual prohibitin-like protein
(PHBL). The SPFH proteins localize to the parasite
mitochondrion. While the conserved family members
could not be deleted from the Plasmodium genome,
PHBL was successfully ablated, resulting in impaired
parasite fitness and attenuated virulence in the
mammalian host. Strikingly, PHBL-deficient para-
sites fail to colonize the Anopheles vector because
of complete arrest during ookinete development
in vivo. We show that this arrest correlates with depo-
larization of the mitochondrial membrane potential
(DJmt). Our results underline the importance of
SPFH proteins in the regulation of core mitochondrial
functions and suggest that fine-tuning of DJmt in
malarial parasites is critical for colonization of the
definitive host.
INTRODUCTION
Proteins
containing
the
stomatin/prohibitin/flotillin/HflK/C
(SPFH) domain can be found all across prokaryotic and eukary-
otic life. Members of this protein family comprise stomatin, sto-
matin-like proteins (SLPs), prohibitins, flotillins, podocin, erlins,
and a multitude of bacterial membrane proteins (Browman
et al., 2007). Whether the SPFH domain evolved independently
in different proteins or whether the SPFH family members share
a common ancestry remains a matter of debate (Rivera-Milla
et al., 2006; Hinderhofer et al., 2009).
SPFH proteins share the �185-amino acid SPFH domain and
contain at least one hydrophobic amino acid stretch, which
promotes association with detergent-resistant membranes of
various organelles, where they form large protein complexes
of 12 or more monomers (Morrow and Parton, 2005; Browman
et al., 2007).
Cumulating evidence suggests that SPFH protein complexes
perform scaffolding functions for proteins and lipids and serve
as molecular platforms for a multitude of cellular processes
(Langhorst et al., 2005; Osman et al., 2009). For instance, the
mitochondrial prohibitin complex has been linked to protein
degradation, mitochondrial morphogenesis, apoptosis, mem-
brane organization, assembly of the respiratory chain, and main-
tenance of mitochondrial DNA (Osman et al., 2009; Merkwirth
and Langer, 2009). This enormous diversity is indicative of a gen-
eral propensity of SPFH proteins to compartmentalize mem-
branes and sequester diverse proteins and catalytic activities.
The remarkable versatility of SPFH complexes prompted us to
investigate this protein family in a parasitic single-cell eukaryote
that faces very different host environments throughout a highly
complex life cycle. Malaria parasites infect a variety of tissues,
including the blood and liver of a mammalian host and the
midgut, hemocoel, and salivary glands of a mosquito vector.
SPFH protein complexes might therefore be key players promot-
ing critical adaptations during these different life cycle stages.
To reveal their subcellular localizations and physiological
roles, we performed experimental genetics in the murine model
parasite Plasmodium berghei and reveal distinct functions of
an unusual prohibitin-like protein in the regulation of the mito-
chondrial membrane potential during host switching.
RESULTS
SPFH Proteins of the Malaria Parasite
We initiated our analysis with a systematic database search
for Plasmodium SPFH proteins and uncovered four candidates
that either display a close phylogenetic relationship to conserved
members—prohibitin 1 (PHB1, PBANKA_0701500), prohibitin 2
(PHB2, PBANKA_1213100), and stomatin-like protein (STOML,
PBANKA_0807100)—or fall into a unique sister group that con-
tains related proteins from the phylum Myzozoa, which harbors
the subphylum Apicomplexa (Figure 1A). Accordingly, we named
the latter Plasmodium protein prohibitin-like protein (PHBL,
PBANKA_0718600). All four proteins contain a central signature

(A) Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates the presence of canonical prohibitin 1 (PHB1, blue) and 2 (PHB2, yellow), a single stomatin-like protein (STOML, green),
and a prohibitin-like protein (PHBL, red) unique to Myzozoa in Plasmodium. Shown is a maximum likelihood tree of 89 SPFH proteins from apicomplexan
parasites, related alveolates, representative eukaryotic species, and a prokaryote (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Big circles, nodes with bootstrap
values of more than 90%; small circles, nodes with values of 65%–90%. Plasmodium proteins are highlighted.

of the promoter and N terminus of HSP70-3 (PBANKA_0914400) fused to GFP (mito-GFP; see also Figure S1A). CT, C terminus. Wild-type (WT)-specific and
integration (INT)-specific primer combinations are indicated by arrows and expected fragments by dotted lines. Note that endogenous tagging of PHB2 and
STOML was performed by single homologous recombination (see also Figure S1B).

 SPFH domain and a hydrophobic stretch (Figure 1B). Although
the conventional Plasmodium SPFH proteins display a similarly
high degree of conservation, PHBL sequences are rather diver-
gent already among related Plasmodium species (Figure 1B).
PHB2, STOML, and PHBL Localize to the Malaria
Parasite Mitochondrion
Because SPFH proteins are known to localize to the membranes
of several different organelles, we first wanted to analyze
their subcellular distribution in malaria parasites. To that end,
we generated transgenic P. berghei lines expressing the endog-
enous SPFH proteins fused to an mCherry-3xMyc tag. In addi-
tion, transfection vectors contained the mitochondrial marker
cassette mito-GFP for protein co-localization (Figures 1C, S1A,
and S1B).
We
successfully
generated
transgenic
lines
expressing
tagged PHB2, STOML, and PHBL (Figure 1D). In contrast,
repeated transfection experiments did not result in the recovery
of a transgenic line expressing tagged PHB1, suggesting that
perturbation of the locus is lethal to the parasite (Figure 1D).
Western blot analysis of parasite extracts confirmed the pres-
ence of full-length PHB2, STOML, and PHBL fusion proteins
and provided no evidence for processing or degradation (Fig-
ure 1E). The expression of PHBL appeared to be much lower
than the expression of PHB2 and STOML. Therefore, we em-
ployed immunofluorescence analysis of the transgenic blood
stage parasites using anti-mCherry and anti-GFP antibodies
to enhance the signals of the tagged proteins. Co-localization
with the mito-GFP marker revealed that PHB2, STOML, and
PHBL all localize to the parasite mitochondrion (Figure 1F).
Next we analyzed the expression of SPFH proteins during the
remaining life cycle stages. Live fluorescence microscopy of the
phb2-tag, stoml-tag, and phbl-tag lines demonstrated ubiqui-
tous expression of all three proteins during parasite develop-
ment in the vertebrate and mosquito hosts (Figure 2). PHBL dis-
played very low expression levels throughout development and
was undetectable in young ring stages (Figure 2C). Interestingly,
STOML was found to concentrate at punctate foci of the parasite
mitochondrion during oocyst growth, often at organellar branch-
ing points (Figure 2B).
Plasmodium berghei PHBL Is Dispensable for Blood
Infection
To assess the importance of the SPFH proteins during asexual
blood propagation, we attempted to delete the corresponding
genes from the P. berghei genome (Figure 3A). Three attempts
to ablate PHB1, PHB2, and STOML did not result in the recovery
of gene deletion mutants, hinting at essential functions during
asexual blood stage development (Figure 3B). The successful
selection of endogenously labeled phb2-tag and stoml-tag para-
site lines (Figure 1D) supports the notion that the corresponding
loci are accessible to genetic manipulation, signifying incompat-
ibility of the absence of PHB2 or STOML with parasite propaga-
tion during blood infection.
In contrast, we were able to isolate transgenic mCherry-fluo-
rescent parasites that lack expression of PHBL using flow cy-
tometry (Kenthirapalan et al., 2012). Correct genomic integration
in the isogenic parasite line was confirmed by diagnostic PCR
and Southern blot analysis (Figures 3B and S1G). We tested
the performance of the phbl– parasites during asexual blood
stage development employing an intravital competition assay
(Matz et al., 2013). Strikingly, the PHBL-deficient mutant grew
at only 37% of the wild-type (WT) rate (Figure 3C). 7 days after
co-injection of the WT and mutant, only 1% of all blood stage
parasites were phbl–, highlighting the marked fitness disadvan-
tage in the absence of PHBL. As a consequence, phbl– parasites
showed attenuated virulence, and infected mice did not suc-
cumb to experimental cerebral malaria (Figure 3D).
phbl– Parasites Fail to Transmit
The ubiquitous expression of PHBL prompted us to test the per-
formance of phbl– parasites during life cycle progression. There-
fore, we fed highly infected mice to female Anopheles stephensi
mosquitoes. Because of the prominent blood stage propagation
defect, we injected a 4-fold higher phbl– inoculum in comparison
to WT parasites, resulting in comparable parasitemias on days 3
and 4 after injection (Figure S2). On day 21 after the blood meal,
infected mosquitoes were allowed to feed on naive C57BL/6
mice, and peripheral blood was monitored daily by microscopic
examination of Giemsa-stained thin blood films. As expected, all
animals bitten by WT-infected mosquitoes became blood stage-
positive on day 3 after bite back (Figure 4A). In stark contrast,
transmission of phbl– parasites was completely abolished. Not
a single mouse that had received bites from mosquitoes infected
with phbl– parasites developed a patent blood infection, demon-
strating essential functions of PHBL for life cycle progression
(Figure 4A).
We next wanted to determine the exact timing of the develop-
mental arrest and tested the capacity of PHBL-deficient para-
sites to form gametocytes. Analysis of peripheral blood revealed
comparable gametocyte conversion rates on days 3 and 4 after
injection (Figure 4B). In agreement with this, phbl– parasites dis-
played normal exflagellation behavior (Figure 4C).
PHBL Is Essential for Ookinete Development In Vivo
To test the fertility of PHBL-deficient gametocytes, we inocu-
lated in vitro cultures with highly infected blood and quantified
the formation of ookinetes. To that end, cultures were stained
with an antibody directed against P28, a surface antigen of mac-
rogametes, zygotes, and ookinetes (Sinden et al., 1987). Live-
cell imaging revealed that 38% of P28-positive WT parasites
had developed into mature ookinetes (Figures 4D and 4E). In
contrast, only 7% of the phbl– parasites reached this develop-
mental stage (Figures 4D and 4E). An additional clonal phbl–
line formed similarly low numbers of ookinetes (Figure S6B).
phbl– ookinetes were viable; they displayed normal gliding
motility in Matrigel (Video S1).
The impairment of ookinete formation in vitro prompted us to
further explore sexual parasite development in the invertebrate
host. To that end, female A. stephensi mosquitoes were fed on
highly infected mice, and mosquito midguts were removed
18 hr later. P28 labeling of the ingested blood revealed that
4% of WT macrogametes had developed into ookinetes (Figures
4D and 4F). Strikingly, no ookinetes were observed in the blood
meals of mosquitoes fed with phbl–-infected mice (Figures 4D
and 4F). Instead, P28-positive phbl– parasites displayed an

 aberrant morphology and decreased size (Figure 4D). During
several experiments, no P28-positive phbl– parasites were de-
tected in the blood meal, despite prominent gametocytemia in
the donor mice and ookinete formation in vitro, suggesting rapid
mortality of early sexual stages and subsequent parasite disinte-
gration in vivo.
To exclude a specific PHBL-dependent in vivo fertilization
defect, we fed highly infected mice to mosquitoes and subse-
quently transferred the ingested blood to in vitro cultures. During
three independent experiments, both WT and phbl– ookinetes
were detected after 2 hr of midgut exposure and subsequent
cultivation, confirming successful fertilization in vivo (Figure 5A).
While approximately 11% of WT macrogametes had trans-
formed into mature ookinetes, phbl– ookinete numbers were
too low for confident quantification, reinforcing that phbl– para-
site mortality occurs early after blood ingestion.
Transmission electron microscopy revealed that arrested
phbl– parasites are much more electron-lucent than ookinetes
recovered from WT-infected mosquitoes, indicative of partial
parasite lysis or leakage (Figures 5B and 5D). Indeed, the
morphology of phbl– parasites was similar to that of WT parasites
arrested during early ookinete development (Figure 5C). This
includes the formation of an electron-dense pellicular region,
the progenitor of the apical complex (Figures 5C–5E). The mito-
chondrion of the arrested phbl– parasites appeared to be intact
and displayed a similar morphology as in arrested WT parasites
(Figures 5B–5D).
Together with the detection of successful albeit 5-fold reduced
formation of phbl– ookinetes in vitro, these data suggest that
PHBL is not essential for fertilization but, rather, promotes sur-
vival during mosquito midgut colonization. Inspection of the
midgut wall 24 hr after feeding confirmed that WT ookinetes
had traversed the epithelium, whereas phbl– parasites were
completely absent (Figure 4G). As a consequence, no PHBL-
deficient oocysts or sporozoites were observed (Figures 4H–4J).
Mitochondrial Organization of PHBL-Deficient Parasites
Remains Unaltered
Depletion of prohibitins has been shown to interfere with mito-
chondrial morphogenesis in yeast (Piper et al., 2002) and several
metazoan species (Artal-Sanz et al., 2003; Kasashima et al.,
2006; Merkwirth et al., 2008). Therefore, we tested whether the
prominent fitness cost in the absence of PHBL is associated
with aberrant mitochondrial morphogenesis. We generated
and isolated mutant parasites expressing fluorescent mitochon-
drial marker proteins in the presence or absence of PHBL. Live
fluorescence microscopy of the generated WTmito-mCh reference
line (Figures S1C and S1D) revealed the typical dot-like pattern in
young ring stages, the rod-like morphology during parasite
growth, the branching, and, ultimately, the organellar division
during the schizont stage (Figure S3A; van Dooren et al., 2005).
A second independent gene deletion line expressing mito-GFP
was generated to analyze mitochondrial morphology in the
absence of PHBL (Figures S1E–S1G). Live-cell imaging of the

replacement plasmids containing 50 and 30 regions flanking the open reading frames, an expression cassette for high-level cytoplasmic mCherry fluorescence,
and the drug-selectable hDHFR-yFcu cassette (drug cassette). WT-specific and INT-specific primer combinations are indicated by arrows and expected
fragments by dotted lines.

shown in (A). The green frame denotes successful isolation of the PHBL loss-of-function mutant. Red frames indicate that three or more independent transfection
experiments did not result in recovery of a gene deletion strain. Note that a second independent PHBL loss-of-function mutant expressing mito-GFP has been
isolated (see also Figures S1E–S1G).

 resultant phbl–
mito-GFP parasites did not reveal any differences in
mitochondrial morphology or integrity during the asexual blood
cycle compared with WTmito-mCh (Figure S3A). Also, organellar
division appeared to be normal because all observed merozoites
harbored a single GFP-fluorescent mitochondrion.
We then purified WT and phbl– macrogametes to assess their
ultrastructure by transmission electron microscopy. PHBL-defi-
cient mitochondria displayed a similar degree of complexity as
WT mitochondria (Figure S3B). Quantification of the area occu-
pied by the parasite mitochondrion and of the mitochondrial
aspect ratios supports the notion of normal mitochondrial size
and integrity in phbl– macrogametes (Figures S3C and S3D).
Furthermore, arrested phbl– parasites extracted from mosquito
midguts displayed a similar mitochondrial morphology as
WT parasites (Figures 5B–5D). To validate this further, purified
WTmito-mCh and phbl–
mito-GFP macrogametes were imaged using
live fluorescence microscopy. Interestingly, phbl–
mito-GFP game-
tocytes or exflagellation events were observed only rarely in
peripheral blood (Figures S3E and S3F). Because gametocyto-
genesis of the WTmito-mCh reference strain and the phbl– line
expressing cytoplasmic mCherry were not impaired (Figures
4B, 4C, S3E, and S3F), we reason that the import of mito-GFP
exerts additional stress on the already dysfunctional PHBL-defi-
cient mitochondrion, leading to added fitness loss in developing

 phbl–
mito-GFP gametocytes. Nonetheless, macrogametes could
be enriched using anti-P28 antibody-labeled magnetic beads,
and both WTmito-mCh and phbl–
mito-GFP parasites showed the
typical highly structured mitochondrial morphology of sexual
stage parasites (Figure S3G).
PHBL Supports Efficient Mosquito-Mouse Transition
To test whether liver stage development was also impaired by
the loss of PHBL, we rescued the mosquito stage arrest by
cross-fertilizing the mCherry-fluorescent phbl– parasites with
GFP-fluorescent Bergreen WT parasites in vivo. A dually infected
donor mouse was fed to A. stephensi mosquitoes after confirm-
ing the presence of both parasite populations by flow cytometry
(Figure 6A). Fluorescence microscopy of mosquito midguts re-
vealed that all mCherry-positive oocysts carrying the phbl– allele
were also expressing GFP, confirming successful cross-fertiliza-
tion and phenotypic rescue (Figure 6B).
After 21 days, infected mosquitoes were allowed to transmit
the parasites to naive C57BL/6 mice by bite. The fluorescent sig-
nals of both WT and phbl– blood stage parasites were detected
by flow cytometry 3 days after transmission (Figures 6C and 6D).
As expected, a double-fluorescent parasite population lacking
PHBL expression was detected as well because of the interchro-
mosomal recombination events during mosquito-stage develop-
ment (Figure 6C and genotype 4 in Figure S4). Diagnostic PCRs
of parasite genomic DNA isolated from donor and recipient mice
confirmed the presence of both WT and phbl– alleles before and
after transmission (Figure 6E).
Next we quantified host transition by comparing the percent-
ages of the fluorescent sporozoite populations with the derived
liver stages in vitro and the emerging blood stages in vivo.
Although the morphology and quantity of phbl– liver stages
were normal in vitro (Figures 6F and 6G), the percentage of the
PHBL-deficient emerging blood stage parasites in vivo was
9-fold lower than would be expected in the case of normal para-
site fitness (Figure 6G).
These data argue for important but dispensable roles of PHBL
during mosquito-mouse transition, which may be overcome by
superior growth conditions in culture, as already demonstrated
for ookinetes (Figures 4D–4F). Together with the detection of
successful, albeit reduced, blood propagation, our findings un-
derline the stage-specific essentiality of PHBL only during sexual

 development and indicate important auxiliary roles in liver and
blood infection.
PHBL Regulates Mitochondrial Membrane Potential
during Sexual Development
Because of the precise and complete arrest of phbl– parasites
during colonization of the invertebrate host, we asked whether
this striking developmental halt correlates with mitochondrial
dysfunction during sexual differentiation. To that end, we
measured the mitochondrial membrane potential (DJmt) of WT
and phbl– mitochondria using the potentiometric dye rhodamine

NMRI mice were co-infected with both GFP-fluorescent Bergreen WT and mCherry-fluorescent phbl– parasites, and female Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes
were allowed to feed on infected mice, leading to cross-fertilization and phenotypic rescue during transmission. 21 days later, mosquitoes were allowed to feed
on naive C57BL/6 mice.
(A) Flow cytometric detection of Bergreen WT and phbl– parasites in the peripheral blood of a donor mouse. Double-fluorescent events represent erythrocytes
harboring both WT and phbl– parasites and are due to the high parasitemia prior to feeding (5%–10%). Boxed numbers indicate genotypes as depicted in
Figure S4.
(B) Double-fluorescent oocysts confirm successful cross-fertilization. Depicted are the signals of the Bergreen WT-derived GFP (green), the phbl–-derived
mCherry (red), and a merge with the DIC image. Note that no homozygous phbl– oocysts (i.e., mCherry-positive and GFP-negative) were observed. Scale bar,
100 mm.
(C) Flow cytometric detection of Bergreen WT and phbl– parasites in peripheral blood of a recipient mouse 3 days after sporozoite inoculation. Note that a PHBL-
deficient double-fluorescent parasite population has emerged because of interchromosomal recombination events during development in the mosquito.
Because of the low parasitemia (< 0.4%), double-infected erythrocytes, as shown in (A), do not occur yet. Boxed numbers indicate genotypes as depicted in
Figure S4.

test, n = 6.
(E) Diagnostic PCR using genomic DNA from blood stage parasites isolated from a donor and a recipient mouse. WT-specific and knockout-specific primer
combinations were used as shown in Figures 3A and 3B. Knockout-specific bands were detected in all recipient mice; n = 6.
(F) In vitro liver stage development of Bergreen WT and PHBL-deficient parasites. Shown are representative micrographs of liver stages 24 and 48 hr after invasion
and detached cells 72 hr after invasion. The micrographs show a merge of the Bergreen WT-derived GFP (green), the phbl–-derived mCherry (red), Hoechst 33342
nuclear dye (blue), and DIC images. Scale bar, 5 mm. The occurrence of double-fluorescent parasites is due to interchromosomal recombination events during
development in the mosquito and signifies the absence of PHBL. Boxed numbers indicate genotypes as depicted in Figure S4.

 uncoupling agent carbonyl cyanide-4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl-
hydrazone (FCCP), which resulted in complete loss of a mito-
chondrial signal during all stages (Figure 7A). WT and phbl– par-
asites responded equally to FCCP treatment (Figure S5).
Staining of PHBL-deficient trophozoites with rhodamine
123 yielded a mitochondrial signal, albeit at lower intensities
than in WT trophozoites (Figure 7A). Quantification of fluores-
cence intensities revealed that the mitochondrial staining of
phbl– trophozoites was reduced 2-fold (to 48%) in comparison
with the WT signal (Figures 7B and 7C). This DJmt defect
became more pronounced during sexual development; macro-
gametes showed only 35% of the WT membrane potential
(Figures 7B and 7C), and in vitro-cultivated ookinetes revealed
an almost completely depolarized parasite mitochondrion in
the phbl– strain. Although individual micrographs lacked a
discernible mitochondrial signal and were indistinguishable
from FCCP-treated WT samples (Figure 7A), quantification of
the fluorescence intensities suggests that the DJmt of phbl–
ookinetes is decreased to 23% (Figures 7B and 7C). The degree
of mitochondrial depolarization was significantly higher in
ookinetes than in blood stage trophozoites. Despite the lack
of statistical support, further comparison with macrogametes
suggests a stepwise decrease of DJmt throughout sexual
development (Figure 7C).
We found that this defect does not correlate with an altered
sensitivity toward the complex III inhibitor and antimalarial drug
atovaquone during asexual or sexual parasite development (Fig-
ures S6A and S6C). In agreement with this observation, exoge-
nous supply of the electron acceptor decylubiquinone did
not improve parasite vitality, as previously shown for asexual
atovaquone-inhibited P. falciparum parasites (Ke et al., 2011;
Figure S6D). Together, these results indicate a stage-dependent
regulation of DJmt by PHBL that is independent of the ubiqui-
none turnover by complex III of the electron transport chain.
DISCUSSION
We show that Plasmodium parasites harbor three conserved
SPFH proteins and an unusual prohibitin-like protein specific
to the Myzozoa. Live-cell imaging of endogenously encoded
parasite proteins revealed that the plasmodial SPFH proteins
localize to the parasite mitochondrion. Although we could not
obtain live localization data for PHB1, the evolutionary conserva-
tion of PHB1/2 hetero-oligomerization strongly suggests that
P. berghei PHB1 is also a mitochondrial protein (Artal-Sanz
et al., 2003; Steglich et al., 1999; Nijtmans et al., 2000).
Immunofluorescence
analysis
using
polyclonal
antisera
directed against a fragment of P. falciparum STOML previously
suggested localization to the secretory organelles of merozoites
and the parasitophorous vacuole during development in eryth-
rocytes (Hiller et al., 2003). This reported localization is at
odds with our own observations and computational predictions,
which return a 93% probability for mitochondrial import of
P. berghei STOML (Claros and Vincens, 1996). We fully corrob-
orate the notion by Hiller et al. (2003) that STOML exhibits the
most resemblance to stomatin-like protein 2 (SLP2), which
was demonstrated to localize to the mitochondria of mice (Da
Cruz et al., 2003), humans (Taylor et al., 2003), and plants
(Gehl et al., 2014). In addition, our observation of site-specific
STOML accumulation during oocyst growth is in agreement
with a role in mitochondrial membrane sub-compartmentaliza-
tion. Together, our data strongly suggest exclusive mitochon-
drial functions of the SPFH protein family in this single-cell
eukaryote.

 Gene targeting in P. berghei suggests that PHB1, PHB2, and
STOML are essential for asexual blood stage development of
the parasite. Genetic disruption might cause lethal defects in or-
ganellar morphology and segregation, which would be in good
agreement with their conserved roles in mitochondrial morpho-
genesis (Piper et al., 2002; Merkwirth et al., 2008, 2012; Christie
et al., 2011). Strikingly, the PHB1 locus could not be targeted
with a non-disruptive tagging construct, most likely because of
an interference of the tag with PHB1 protein function. However,
the accessibility of the genomic locus, and, thus, the essentiality
of PHB1, remain to be formally demonstrated.
Interestingly, Plasmodium parasites express an additional and
uncommon mitochondrial prohibitin-like SPFH protein, PHBL,
specific to the myzozoan clade. In contrast to the bona fide
PHBs of other organisms, PHBL is expressed at very low levels
and not involved in mitochondrial morphogenesis or segrega-
tion. Instead, we provide evidence for specific functions of
PHBL in the regulation of mitochondrial membrane polarity.
Several proteins initially thought to aid the generation of DJmt,
such as complexes I, II, and V of the electron transport chain,
were
dispensable
for
DJmt
maintenance
in
transgenic
P. berghei parasites (Boysen and Matuschewski, 2011; Hino
et al., 2012; Sturm et al., 2015). Together with our own observa-
tions of normal atovaquone sensitivity and lack of phenotypic
rescue by decylubiquinone, these findings lead us to hypothe-
size that PHBL might regulate membrane polarity independent
of individual complexes of the electron transport chain.
The
molecular
mechanism
underlying
PHBL-dependent
depolarization remains to be determined. Mitochondrial SPFH
proteins have previously been demonstrated to influence
membrane polarity in other systems, which has been linked to
impaired sequestration of the respiratory machinery to mem-
brane microdomains (Gehl and Sweetlove, 2014). Similar inter-
actions might be the underlying mechanism behind the PHBL-
dependent membrane depolarization in malaria parasites.
Whether the lower membrane potential can be attributed to an
impairment in the generation of the chemiosmotic gradient or,
instead, to its enhanced utilization for ATP production remains
to be shown. In most eukaryotic cells, oligomycin inhibition can
be used to discriminate between the two potential causes. How-
ever, classical ATP synthase inhibitors, like oligomycin or azide,
are ineffective in Plasmodium (Mather et al., 2010), including in
sexual stages, where ookinete formation of WT and phbl– para-
sites was largely unaffected (Figure S7).
Although PHBL is expressed throughout the plasmodial life
cycle, we observed the most substantial depolarization of
DJmt in sexual stages, culminating in developmental arrest dur-
ing mosquito midgut colonization. In contrast, PHBL appears to
be less important for the parasite during infection of the verte-
brate host. We note that mitochondrial depolarization during
sexual development is not a secondary effect of parasite death
because mortality was bypassed by superior growth conditions
in vitro, suggesting that the degree of depolarization is likely even
higher in the mosquito midgut.
The stage-specific arrest caused by the lack of P. berghei
PHBL is reminiscent of Saccharomyces cerevisiae PHB1/2-null
mutants. Only non-dividing yeast cells, which are arrested in
the stationary G0 phase, tend to lose respiratory competence
(Piper and Bringloe, 2002). It has been argued that this phenom-
enon might result from an imbalanced turnover of respiratory
chain complexes because of the lack of PHBs and insufficient
de novo synthesis of the respiratory machinery in the resting
cell (Piper and Bringloe, 2002). We note that PHBL-deficient ma-
laria parasites display a similar developmental specificity for the
non-dividing gametocyte and ookinete stages of the life cycle.
Our microscopic quantification shows that the DJmt of WT
parasites is most pronounced in macrogametes (�2-fold higher
than in trophozoites or ookinetes), suggesting a critical period of
enhanced mitochondrial demand during host switching. This is in
agreement with previous literature demonstrating an increased
dependence on mitochondrial functions during mosquito midgut
colonization (Florens et al., 2002; Hall et al., 2005; Srivastava
et al., 2016), thus providing a possible explanation for the
stage-specific consequences of PHBL depletion.
Together, our data demonstrate important mitochondrial func-
tions of the SPFH protein family in malaria parasites and reveal
the involvement of an unusual family member in the regulation
of DJmt during transmission to the definitive host.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Phylogenetic Reconstruction
See the Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details regarding phyloge-
netic analysis.
Generation of Recombinant Parasite Lines
We used advanced experimental genetic techniques to generate and isolate all
recombinant parasite lines (Janse et al., 2006; Kooij et al., 2012; Kenthirapalan
et al., 2012;Matzand Kooij, 2015). Details on vector construction, parasiteisola-
tion, and genotyping strategies, including primer sequences and restriction
endonuclease recognition sites used for molecular cloning, are provided in Fig-
ures 1C, 3A, and S1; Table S1; and Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Experimental Animals
This study was carried out in strict accordance with the German Tierschutzge-
setz in der Fassung vom 22. Juli 2009, the Dutch Experiments on Animals Act
(Wod 2014), and the Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and
Council on the Protection of Animals Used for Experimental and Other
Scientific purposes. The protocol was approved by the ethics committee of
the Berlin state authority (Landesamt f€
ur Gesundheit und Soziales Berlin,
permit number G0294/15). All animal experiments performed at the Radbou-
dumc were approved by the Radboud University Experimental Animal Ethical
Committee (RUDEC 2012-251). Female C57BL/6 mice were used for sporo-
zoite infections and detection of malaria-related complications. All other para-
site infections were conducted with male or female NMRI mice.
In Vivo Infections
Asexual blood stage development was assessed using the previously
described intravital competition assay (Matz et al., 2013). To test atovaquone
sensitivity, highly infected mice received daily intraperitoneal injections of ato-
vaquone (1.44 mg/kg body weight), and parasitemia was measured by flow cy-
tometry. To test transmission efficiency, naive mice were subjected to bites
from 100 or more female A. stephensi mosquitoes 21 days after the infectious
blood meal. Blood stage patency was assessed by either microscopic analysis
of Giemsa-stained thin blood films or by flow cytometric analysis of peripheral
blood. For details regarding parasite inocula, see the Supplemental Experi-
mental Procedures.
Microscopy

 Ookinete Cultivation
Ookinetes were cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Thermo
Fisher Scientific), 50 mM xanthurenic acid, 0.85 g/L NaHCO3 (pH 8.0, ookinete
medium), and, in some cases, with varying concentrations of atovaquone,
decylubiquinone, or oligomycin A. 10 mL of blood from highly infected mice
or the ingested blood from 3 infected mosquitoes was transferred to 90 mL
of ookinete medium and incubated in a 96-well plate at 20�C for 24 hr.
Detection of DJmt
Rhodamine 123 staining was performed as described previously (Sturm et al.,
2015). Asexual blood stage parasites were transferred from infected mice into
RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% FCS and stained with 0.1 mg/mL
rhodamine 123 for 30 min. In addition, the medium contained either 50 mM of
the uncoupling agent FCCP or DMSO as a solvent control. Parasites were
washed once in medium and left at 37�C for 30 more min prior to live micro-
scopy. The same procedure was applied to macrogametes and ookinetes,
with the alterations that ookinete medium was used and that staining and
washing was performed at room temperature.
Statistical Analysis
Most comparisons between two experimental groups were analyzed with a
Student’s t test. One-way ANOVA in combination with Tukey’s multiple com-
parison test was used for comparisons between more than two groups. Prepa-
tency and development of experimental cerebral malaria were analyzed with a
Mantel-Cox test and blood stage development with a two-way ANOVA and
linear regression analysis.
