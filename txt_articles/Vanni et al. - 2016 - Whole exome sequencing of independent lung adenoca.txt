Abstract
The presence of multiple primary tumors (MPT) in a single patient has been identified with an increasing frequency. A critical issue is to
establish if the second tumor represents an independent primary cancer or a metastasis. Therefore, the assessment of MPT clonal
origin might help understand the disease behavior and improve the management/prognosis of the patient.
Herein, we report a 73-year-old male smoker who developed 2 primary lung cancers (adenocarcinoma and squamous cell
carcinoma) and a malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (PM).
Whole exome sequencing (WES) of the 3 tumors and of germline DNA was performed to determine the clonal origin and identify
genetic cancer susceptibility.
Both lung cancers were characterized by a high mutational rate with distinct mutational profiles and activation of tumor-specific
pathways. Conversely, the PM harbored a relative low number of genetic variants and a novel mutation in the WT1 gene that might be
involved in the carcinogenesis of nonasbestos-related mesothelioma. Finally, WES of the germinal DNA displayed several single
nucleotide polymorphisms in DNA repair genes likely conferring higher cancer susceptibility.
Overall, WES did not disclose any somatic genetic variant shared across the 3 tumors, suggesting their clonal independency;
however, the carcinogenic effect of smoke combined with a deficiency in DNA repair genes and the patient advanced age might have
been responsible for the MPT development. This case highlights the WES importance to define the clonal origin of MPT and
susceptibility to cancer.

 1. Introduction
The incidence of multiple primary tumors (MPT) during an
individual’s lifetime is increasing, mainly due to the advent of
accurate cancer secondary prevention programs and the increase
of life expectancy for cancer patients. The development of
multiple primary lung cancers (MPLC) is an uncommon event,
although the improvement in the diagnostic tests and novel
therapies able to influence survival after the first diagnosis of
cancer have led to an incidence peak that has grown up to 20%
over the past 10 years.[1,2] A correct understanding whether the
second tumor is an independent primary lesion or a metastasis is
fundamental for an adequate therapeutic management of these
patients. Currently, the main criteria for defining the lineage of
multiple unrelated intrapulmonary tumors compared with
metastatic lesions are based on pathological and clinical
assessments.[3,4] To date, several studies have described MPLC
cases,[1] but most of them have analyzed a limited number of
genetic markers, resulting in a low accuracy and limited ability to
establish cancers clonality.[5,6] Next generation sequencing
(NGS) is a recent technology that can contribute to understand-
ing the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor development by
screening the whole DNA mutational profile.[7–10] Recently,
Murphy et al[11] applied the NGS approach to define the lineage
of MPLC, demonstrating how genomic rearrangements were able
to distinguish MPLC from metastatic lesions; however, the
authors did not evaluate somatic and germinal mutational
profiles. Once established that MPLC are primary and indepen-
dent tumors, understanding the intrinsic genetic susceptibility to
develop multiple cancers during the lifetime is crucial; indeed,
those subjects with high predisposition might be enrolled in
prevention programs and benefit from personalized follow-ups.
Herein, we report an interesting case of a patient that developed 2
primary histologically distinct lung tumors and a malignant PM
after 6 years. WES allowed us to deeply screen the 3 tumors, in
order to identify a mutational signature specific for each
malignancy and to establish the clonal origin of cancers.
Concomitantly, the sequencing of normal genomic DNA (gDNA)
allowed the identification of germline genetic variants potentially
correlated with an individual risk of developing multiple cancers.
2. Case report
We describe the case of a Caucasian male patient with a medical
history of heavy smoking habit (100 pack-years), chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and no exposure to
asbestos. Before being referred to our unit, the patient was
initially followed and treated in a different institution; hence, part
of the patient’s oncologic history was retrospectively retraced
when he came to our attention (Fig. 1). In January 2009, the
patient, aged 73 years, was subjected to a chest X-ray as
preoperative examination for minor surgery with the incidental
detection of a suspicious opacity in the left lower lobe. The
subsequent diagnostic work-up confirmed a high-risk lesion in
the left lower lobe; in addition, the computed tomography (CT)
scan identified a smaller lesion in the right upper lobe (22mm),
which was considered an indeterminate lung nodule due to its
morphologic characteristics, along with unspecific micro-nodules
in the same lung. As the position of the pulmonary findings and
the structural lung alterations caused by COPD prevented the
collection of bioptic samples, the decision of approaching the left
lung lesion with surgery and periodically evaluate the evolution
of the indeterminate nodule was taken. Hence, the patient
underwent left lung lower lobe segmental resection in April 2009,
with postoperative diagnosis of stage IB lung adenocarcinoma
(ADC) with solid and glandular patterns and foci of mucus
secretion (Fig. 2A). The immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis
revealed positivity for TTF-1, consistently with the diagnosis of a
lung primary tumor. The postoperative pathological staging was
pT2a, G3, Nx, Mx.
The indeterminate nodule in the right upper lobe remained
stable until September 2010, when an increase of its maximum
diameters from 22 to 33mm was reported; a positron emission
tomography (PET) scan showed fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)
uptake limited to the right upper lobe lesion (SUV max: 6.2).
Following this finding, the lesion was considered a metastasis of
the
original
ADC
and
subsequently
the
patient
received
chemotherapy with carboplatin (AUC2), which was discontinued
after 2 cycles for thrombocytopenia. During the subsequent
assessments, the pulmonary lesion was substantially stable until
November 2011, when a significant dimensional increase was
observed. A subsequent PET-scan confirmed the right lung lesion
as the only clearly detectable active site of disease (SUV max:
12.6, increased from the previous examination), while no distant
metastases were identified; therefore, surgery with potential
curative intent for oligo-metastatic disease was proposed. Hence,
in January 2012, the patient underwent right upper lobectomy
and radical lymphadenectomy with postoperative diagnosis of
keratinizing
and
moderately
differentiated
squamous
cell
carcinoma (SCC) of the lung with positivity for p63 at IHC
(pT2a G2 pN0 Mx, stage IB) (Fig. 2B). Although the clinical
presentation could initially suggest a possible correlation between
the 2 lung lesions, the IHC led to define 2 histologically distinct
primary lung tumors. After surgery, the patient did not receive
further treatments. In February 2014, metabolically active gastric
lymphadenopathies and ascites were detected during follow-up,
although no suspicious lesions were identified with esophago-
gastroduodenoscopy. Between October 2014 and January 2015,
diffuse
nodulations
within
the
abdomen,
morphologically
compatible with peritoneal carcinomatosis, and a new lesion
in the middle lobe of the right lung were identified. In February
2015, the patient was referred to our institution (Lung Cancer
Unit; IRCCS AOU San Martino - IST, Genova, Italy), wherein he
underwent biopsy of an easily accessible abdominal lesion
located at the level of the right iliac fossa. At microscopic
examination, the specimen was consistent with several small
fibrous fragments diffusely infiltrated by an epitheliomorphic
neoplasm composed of atypical cells, ranging from middle to
large dimension, with well-represented eosinophilic cytoplasm,
sometimes microvacuolated, and large nuclei, with prominent
eosinophilic nucleoli; rare “hobnail cells” were identified and the
neoplastic elements were arranged in solid nests, ribbons, and
papillary structures. At IHC, expression of CK7, CK5&6,
calretinin, and WT-1 was detected in neoplastic cells, whereas no
expression of CK20, p63, MOC-31, TTF-1, and napsin-A was
reported (Fig. 2C–H). On the basis of the morphology and the
IHC pattern, the diagnosis of epithelioid PM was posed and,
subsequently, the patient received chemotherapy with peme-
trexed (500mg/m2), which was discontinued after 2 cycles due to
poor tolerance. Then, the patient experienced progressive
worsening of clinical conditions and died in March 2015.
Relevant images from CT-scans collected throughout the clinical
history of the patients have been reported in Fig. 3.
In order to understand whether ADC, SCC, and PM were
unrelated cancers or shared a common clonal evolution, WES
analysis was performed on the 3 tumors by HiSeq 2500 sequencer
(Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA, USA) as already described.[12]

 Simultaneously, the WES of germinal gDNA obtained from
peripheral blood was performed to subtract the germline
background for the identification of somatic variants (see text,
Supplemental Content 1, http://links.lww.com/MD/B418, which
illustrates samples processing and WES analysis).[12–15] For this
analysis, the ADC and the SCC samples were collected from
stored surgical specimens (acquired during potentially curative
surgery), while the PM sample derived from the tissue collected
during the abdominal biopsy.
We firstly extracted the somatic mutational signature from all
the tumors according to base substitutions, as already described
by Alexandrov et al.[8] This analysis displayed a predominance of
C>A transversions in both lung cancers (ADC and SCC)
(Fig. 4A), corresponding to a specific cancer signature related to
tobacco consumption.[8] In contrast, the PM did not exhibit any
specific mutational signature, probably as a consequence of the
few observed somatic variants (Fig. 4A). Then, we found that
each tumor reported a specific set of somatic variants (358, 405,
28 in ADC, SCC, and PM, respectively; Fig. 4B; See Table,

which list all somatic mutations found in ADC, SCC, and PM,
respectively), which were not shared across the 3 tumors. Both
ADC and SCC showed lung tumor hotspot mutations reported in
the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC; http://
cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic) database and described in lung
cancers: EHHADH (COSM5247826), KRAS (COSM512),
OR4K2 (COSM1515038), and TP53 (COSM6549) in ADC;
KIAA1324L (COSM396629), NFE2L2 (COSM396629), PEG3
(COSM5284477), POM121L12 (COSM393793), and WAC
(COSM5311283) in SCC. Moreover, both histotypes carried
mutations associated with potential therapeutic targets (FLT3
and HGF in ADC; MTOR in SCC), or in a predictor of resistance
to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (KRAS in ADC).
The enrichment analysis using Reactome 2015 (http://amp.
pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/) also showed that different pathways
were deregulated in ADC and SCC. Specifically, ADC was
enriched with altered genes belonging to the MAPK pathway
(p.Gly12Phe KRAS; c.∗76delC MAP2K; c.∗30C>T MAP3K4),

 whereas the mutations observed in SCC mostly affected genes
involved in collagen modification, in extracellular matrix
organization (p.His1331Gln ADAMTS3; p.Phe486Ser CO-
L19A1; p.Ala75fs LOX; c.93+567C>A SPP1; p.Pro947Ser
LAMB1; p.Met688Ile A2M), and in the meiotic synapsis
pathway (p.Ser1801Gly ATR; p.Gln1747Glu DIDO1; c.1961
+53A>T SUN1; c.17542-41A>C SYNE1). Conversely, the PM
did not display COSMIC mutations or pathways associated with
the carcinogenesis, probably due to the low number of somatic
mutations (28); however, among these mutations, we identified 3
novel variants including 2 frameshift variants (p.Glu673fs BAP1;
p.Glu1595fs SETD2) and a missense variant (p.Ser71Phe WT1).
Germline analysis was also performed in order to discover
genetic variants potentially linked to cancer predisposition.
Germinal gDNA sequencing identified a total of 31,608 genetic
variants of which 15,790 and 15,818 occurred in exons and
nonexons regions, respectively (Fig. 4B). In particular, 49% (7784/
15,790) of the exon variants showed a high/moderate effect on the
protein, whereas the 66% (10,397/15,818) of nonexon variants
potentially modified the protein regulation based on effect
prediction of SnpEff tool (http://snpeff.sourceforge.net).
As pathway analysis did not disclose enrichment pathways
linked to tumor susceptibility, we focused on genes related to
DNA repair or associated with cancer predisposition. The
analysis identified 74 genetic variants in 59 genes related to DNA
repair/cancer predisposition. Specifically, 21 out of 74 genetic
variants have already been described to confer a high risk of
cancer
development

3. Discussion
Here, we describe an infrequent case of a patient who developed 2
histological distinct intrapulmonary tumors and a PM after 6
years. WES of the 3 tumors was performed to establish a clonal
relationship. Although both lung ADC and SCC showed a similar
mutational signature, characterized by a prominence of C>A
substitutions, they did not share common somatic variants.
Interestingly, the signature characterized by C>A mutations has
been associated with smoke exposure in several cancers including
lung ADC and SCC[8]; indeed, cigarettes contain a complex
mixture of carcinogenic agents and these compounds could
interact with DNA leading to the accumulation of somatic
mutations. Recently, Warth et al[6] analyzed a set of synchronous
primary lung tumors demonstrating that clonally independent
ADC and SCC tumors were mainly identified in heavy smoker
patients. These data support the association between extensive
smoking and the development of the 2 clonally unrelated lung
tumors occurred in our case. Across 358 altered genes in the
ADC, we found 6 (KRAS, MAP2K1, MGAM, NF1, PPP3CA,
and TP53) of 38 genes significantly mutated in a cohort of 660
lung ADC.[16] Of note, mutation in PPP3CA co-occurred with an
activating KRAS mutation (COSM512) as already described by
Campbell et al.[16] In addition, the mutation in the MGAM gene
has been also observed in a comprehensive genome-wide
characterization by Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network
among 18 genes found significantly mutated in 230 lung ADC
tumors.[17] Across the 405 SCC-mutated genes, we found only 1
gene (NFE2L2) of 20 genes recurrent mutated in 484 lung SCC
tumors[16]; moreover, mutations in NFE3L2 gene have also been
identified in 34% of 178 lung SCC tumors profiled by Cancer
Genome Atlas Research Networt.[18]
Furthermore, both lung tumors showed a specific gene
signature linked to distinct pathways of activation. Specifically,
the ADC harbored mutations in genes involved in EGFR
signaling pathway, such as 2 novel genetic variants in the
3’UTR regions of MAP3K4 and MAP2K1 genes, and a hotspot
mutation in the KRAS codon 12; as it is known, the EGFR
signaling pathway is one of the most frequently altered pathways
in this histology.[19] On the contrary, the SCC carried several
mutations
in
genes
involved
in
the
extracellular
matrix
organization, a pathway often deregulated in cancer.[20] In
particular, we found a novel frameshift deletion (c.221delC; p.
Ala75fs) leading to a potential LOX protein destruction. LOX
downmodulation has been found in SCC and its lack has been
shown to induce the extracellular matrix disorganization leading
to tumor development.[21] Furthermore, in addition to being
potentially involved in tumor development, some of the affected
genes that were observed in this case might also play a relevant
role in a targeted therapy approach in patients affected by lung
cancer, possibly reducing sensitivity to currently registered agents
or eventually representing potential targets for drugs that might
become available for lung cancer in future. Although it is still
unclear whether KRAS mutations are actually associated with
resistance to EGFR inhibitors in lung cancer,[22] aberrations of
HGF signal are apparently involved in resistance to anti-EGFR
and anti-VEGF targeted therapies.[23] Contrarily, FLT-3 and
mTOR might represent potentially actionable targets, as the
former is sensitive to drugs such as dovitinib, while the latter is
sensitive to everolimus.[24]
Conversely, in PM, the distribution of base substitutions did
not match any specific mutational signature, probably as a
consequence of a relatively limited number of observed mutations
(28 variants in PM vs >350 in the lung cancer lesions). Peritoneal
mesothelioma is an extremely rare tumor and our sequencing
data were in accordance with a previous study in which the
authors performed WES on 7 PM finding a low mutational rate
Figure 4. (A) Specific mutational signature for ADC, SCC, and PM according to the base substitutions.[8] The substitution types are showed on the horizontal axis,
whereas the percentages of base substitutions are displayed on the vertical axis. (B) Mutational profile of somatic (ADC, SCC, and PM) and germline (PB) gene
variants divided in single nucleotide variant (SNV), multiple nucleotide variant (MNV), and INDEL. Each type of mutation was subdivided into exon or non-exon
(intergenic regions, downstream and upstream regions, 5’UTR/3’UTR regions, splice regions, and intron regions) variants. “Stop gained”: variant causes a stop
codon; “Start_Stop lost”: variant causes start codon to be mutated into a nonstart codon or variant causes stop codon to be mutated into a nonstop codon,
respectively; “Splice region variant”: variant affective putative (Lariat) branch point from U12 splicing machinery, located in the intron; “Sequence Feature”: unknown/
any extent of continuous biological sequence.

 and BAP1 as the most altered gene.[25] We also found an insertion
in BAP1, potentially associated with a loss-of-function, and a
deletion changing the reading frame in SETD2, a gene found
altered in malignant pleural mesothelioma.[26] In addition, we
detected a novel mutation in the WT1 transactivation domain
(NM_000378.4; c.212C>T; p.Ser71Phe). Mutated WT1 has
been already described in mesothelioma; interestingly, Park
et al[27] reported a patient with PM that harbored a point
mutation within the transactivation domain of WT1 gene,
demonstrating that this variant conferred an activation of its
transcriptional role. However, the authors did not find any WT1
mutations in a further set of 32 asbestos-related mesothelioma
patients, thus concluding that the WT1 pathway could be
involved in the malignant transformation of nonasbestos-related
mesothelioma. These data suggest that the p.Ser71Phe WT1
mutation might be implicated in the PM carcinogenesis process
through the WT1 downstream pathway activation. Indeed, the
mutation serine-71-phenylalanine (p.Ser71Phe) in WT1 gene is a
nonconservative mutation that alters the properties of the protein
by replacing the small and polar serine with the large and bulky
side chain of a phenylalanine.
According to the previous data and excluding a common
lineage across the 3 tumors, we hypothesized that this patient
could have an intrinsic predisposition to develop MPT. Indeed,
the germinal gDNA sequencing showed that more than half of the
variants were potentially associated with protein alterations.
Notably, the analysis identified 21 genetic variants that were
already described; of these, 62% were related to increased lung
cancer risk. Among such variants, the association of the p.
Glu589Lys in EXO1 gene (rs1047840) with cigarette smoking
has been described as conferring a significantly increased lung
cancer risk, with a reported odds ratio equal to 1.72.[28]
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that
investigates the whole exome mutational profile of 3 MPT aimed
at defining the clonal origin of the tumor lesions and also the
germline assets in order to discover an individual genetic
susceptibility to cancer predisposition. Our data support the
hypothesis that the development of the 3 tumors was clonally
independent, as they do not share a common mutational profile;
however, we could not exclude the presence of mutations in
regulatory regions, omitted by WES. The patient also carried
several SNPs involved in nicotine dependence and DNA repair.
The carcinogenic effects of tobacco smoke together with both a
DNA repair deficiency and the advanced age of the patient may
have led to a high mutation rate in the lung cancer lesions. It is
also known that chemotherapy might affect the mutational status
of eukaryote cells.[29] Despite the only 2 cycles of carboplatin,
considering the interval between treatment and SCC tumor
collection (about 14 months), we cannot exclude the mutagenic
effect induced by carboplatin.
On the contrary, the low number of somatic mutations in PM
suggests that its development is mainly caused by onset of
mutations in driver genes (BAP1 and SETD2) and that other
mechanisms,
such
as
microRNA
deregulation,
might
be
involved.[30] In addition, the novel missense mutation in WT1
gene may also explain the PM development regardless of asbestos
exposure.
In conclusion, this study underlines how the germline assets
could influence the cancer predisposition and how future WES
studies on patients with MPT should be directed toward the
genetic variants identification leading to cancer susceptibility.
Our findings highlight the power of WES analysis in screening the
mutational landscapes of patient with MPT in order to define the
clonal feature and identify novel potential molecular targets for
treatment.
