BACKGROUND
The benefits of triple therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with 
an inhaled glucocorticoid, a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), and a long-
acting β2-agonist (LABA), as compared with dual therapy (either inhaled glucocorticoid–
LABA or LAMA–LABA), are uncertain.
METHODS
In this randomized trial involving 10,355 patients with COPD, we compared 52 
weeks of a once-daily combination of fluticasone furoate (an inhaled glucocorti-
coid) at a dose of 100 μg, umeclidinium (a LAMA) at a dose of 62.5 μg, and 
vilanterol (a LABA) at a dose of 25 μg (triple therapy) with fluticasone furoate–
vilanterol (at doses of 100 μg and 25 μg, respectively) and umeclidinium–vilanterol 
(at doses of 62.5 μg and 25 μg, respectively). Each regimen was administered in a 
single Ellipta inhaler. The primary outcome was the annual rate of moderate or 
severe COPD exacerbations during treatment.
RESULTS
The rate of moderate or severe exacerbations in the triple-therapy group was 0.91 per 
year, as compared with 1.07 per year in the fluticasone furoate–vilanterol group (rate 
ratio with triple therapy, 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80 to 0.90; 15% differ-
ence; P<0.001) and 1.21 per year in the umeclidinium–vilanterol group (rate ratio with 
triple therapy, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.81; 25% difference; P<0.001). The annual rate 
of severe exacerbations resulting in hospitalization in the triple-therapy group was 
0.13, as compared with 0.19 in the umeclidinium–vilanterol group (rate ratio, 0.66; 
95% CI, 0.56 to 0.78; 34% difference; P<0.001). There was a higher incidence of pneu-
monia in the inhaled-glucocorticoid groups than in the umeclidinium–vilanterol 
group, and the risk of clinician-diagnosed pneumonia was significantly higher with 
triple therapy than with umeclidinium–vilanterol, as assessed in a time-to-first-event 
analysis (hazard ratio, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.22 to 1.92; P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS
Triple therapy with fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium, and vilanterol resulted in a 
lower rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations than fluticasone furoate–
vilanterol or umeclidinium–vilanterol in this population. Triple therapy also resulted 
in a lower rate of hospitalization due to COPD than umeclidinium–vilanterol. (Funded

T
riple inhaled therapy for chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 
comprises an inhaled glucocorticoid, a 
long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), and 
a long-acting β2-agonist (LABA). Such treatment 
is recommended in the Global Initiative for 
Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) man-
agement strategy for COPD in patients who have 
clinically significant symptoms despite treat-
ment with an inhaled glucocorticoid–LABA or 
LAMA–LABA and who are at increased risk for 
frequent or severe exacerbations.1,2 Although 
studies have shown that triple inhaled therapy 
has positive effects on lung function and COPD 
symptoms as compared with dual therapy,3-13 its 
use until recently has required patients to use 
multiple inhalers several times per day.14,15
Recently, single inhalers containing an inhaled 
glucocorticoid, a LABA, and a LAMA have been 
developed; these inhalers offer potential advan-
tages in practicality and adherence to therapy. 
However, the effectiveness of combination in-
haled therapies has not been comprehensively 
evaluated in patients with COPD who have the 
highest symptom burden. Controversy exists re-
garding the use of inhaled glucocorticoids in 
COPD and the relative benefits of triple therapy 
as compared with dual therapy (inhaled gluco-
corticoid–LABA or LAMA–LABA) in patients with 
a history of previous exacerbations. The Inform-
ing the Pathway of COPD Treatment (IMPACT) 
trial evaluated the relative benefits and risks of 
these three regimens in patients with symptom-
atic COPD and a history of exacerbations.16 Here 
we report the primary, secondary, and other ef-
ficacy and safety outcomes.
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
The IMPACT trial was a phase 3, randomized, 
double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter trial.16 
The primary objective was to evaluate the effects 
of 52 weeks of a once-daily combination of 
fluticasone furoate (an inhaled glucocorticoid) 
at a dose of 100 μg, umeclidinium (a LAMA) at 
a dose of 62.5 μg, and vilanterol (a LABA) at a 
dose of 25 μg (triple therapy), as compared with 
fluticasone furoate–vilanterol (at doses of 100 μg 
and 25 μg, respectively) or the dual bronchodila-
tor umeclidinium–vilanterol (at doses of 62.5 μg 
and 25 μg, respectively), on the rate of moderate 
or severe COPD exacerbations. Each regimen was 
administered in a single dry-powder inhaler 
(Ellipta, GlaxoSmithKline).
Patients enrolled were 40 years of age or older 
and had symptomatic COPD (COPD Assessment 
Test [CAT] score, ≥10; range, 0 to 40, with 
higher scores indicating more symptoms; mini-
mal clinically important difference, 2 units). 
Patients had to have either a forced expiratory 
volume in 1 second (FEV1) that was less than 
50% of the predicted normal value and a history 
of at least one moderate or severe exacerbation 
in the previous year, or an FEV1 of 50 to 80% of 
the predicted normal value and at least two 
moderate exacerbations or one severe exacerba-
tion in the previous year. Patients continued to 
take their own medication, which could include 
a LAMA, a LABA, or an inhaled glucocorticoid 
alone or in combination, during a 2-week run-in 
period before randomization.
The trial was performed in 37 countries from 
June 2014 through July 2017. It was conducted in 
accordance with Good Clinical Practice guide-
lines and the provisions of the Declaration of 
Helsinki and received approval from local insti-
tutional review boards or independent ethics 
committees. All the patients provided written 
informed consent. The patients and treatment 
groups are described in Tables S1 through S3 in 
the Supplementary Appendix, available with the 
full text of this article at NEJM.org.
All the patients underwent baseline chest ra-
diography at trial entry, and all initial and sub-
sequent chest images were overread centrally by 
radiologists who were unaware of the clinical 
information or trial treatment. The assignment 
of a diagnosis of pneumonia and the labeling of 
an event as an exacerbation were determined ac-
cording to the clinical judgment of the investiga-
tor. The protocol required that all the patients 
with a suspected pneumonia, or moderate or 
severe exacerbation, have a chest radiograph 
obtained to help confirm the presence of a new 
infiltrate and better capture and understand these 
adverse events. When a diagnosis of pneumonia 
was made, the clinician also considered increased 
cough, sputum purulence, dyspnea, and signs on 
physical examination or laboratory testing.
The trial was designed by academic partners 
and the sponsor (GlaxoSmithKline), which also 
paid for editorial support; the lead author is an 
employee of the sponsor. All the authors dis-

Triple vs. Dual Therapy in Patients with COPD
cussed and interpreted the results, agree with 
the completeness and accuracy of the data and 
analyses, and vouch for the adherence of the 
trial to the protocol, available at NEJM.org. All 
the authors contributed to the data analyses and 
writing of the manuscript.
Primary Efficacy Outcome
The primary efficacy outcome was the annual 
rate of moderate or severe exacerbations during 
treatment (including 1 day after the last dose 
was administered). The two coprimary treatment 
comparisons were triple therapy versus umecli-
dinium–vilanterol, and triple therapy versus 
fluticasone furoate–vilanterol.
Patients completed an electronic diary each 
morning to record their symptoms and were 
alerted to contact their trial investigator if symp-
toms suggestive of an exacerbation worsened 
over the course of 2 consecutive days. The inves-
tigator confirmed the presence or absence of an 
exacerbation. The severity of an exacerbation was 
defined according to the treatment. A mild ex-
acerbation was worsening of symptoms treated 
with increased albuterol. A moderate exacerba-
tion was defined as an exacerbation leading to 
treatment with antibiotics or systemic glucocor-
ticoids. A severe exacerbation was one resulting 
in hospitalization or death.
Secondary and Other Efficacy Outcomes
Secondary outcomes in the statistical hierarchy 
were grouped sequentially according to lung 
function and symptoms and the time to the first 
exacerbation. The first analysis block included 
spirometry to assess trough FEV1 and the change 
in the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire 
(SGRQ) total score, as measured by the COPD-
specific version, to assess health-related quality 
of life (scores range from 0 to 100, with lower 
scores indicating better health-related quality 
of life; minimal clinically important difference, 
4 points). The second block in the hierarchy as-
sessed the time to the first moderate or severe 
COPD exacerbation during treatment (Fig. S2 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
Prespecified protocol-defined secondary out-
comes that were not in the hierarchy included 
the annual rate of moderate or severe exacerba-
tions and the time to the first moderate or severe 
exacerbation among patients with a blood eosino-
phil count of at least 150 cells per microliter at 
baseline, and the annual rate of severe exacerba-
tions. Protocol-defined other outcomes included 
analyses of lung function, time to death from 
any cause, health-related quality of life, and all 
exacerbations (mild, moderate, or severe) in the 
entire patient population and dyspnea in a sub-
set of patients as assessed according to the Base-
line Dyspnea Index and Transition Dyspnea In-
dex (TDI; values range from −9 to 9, with lower 
values indicating worsening severity of dyspnea; 
minimal clinically important difference, 1 unit). 
(For details, see the section on additional statis-
tical information in the Supplementary Appen-
dix or see the protocol and statistical analysis 
plan, available with the protocol.)
Safety Assessments
Incidences of adverse events, serious adverse 
events, pneumonia, cardiovascular events, bone 
fractures, and other adverse events of special 
interest (prespecified adverse events associated 
with the use of inhaled glucocorticoids, LAMAs, 
or LABAs) were documented at each clinic visit. 
Supporting radiography was used to document 
incidences of pneumonia.
Electrocardiographic (ECG) measurements and 
vital signs were assessed at screening and after 
4, 28, and 52 weeks of treatment. Clinical 
(chemical and hematologic) assessments were 
performed at screening and at 16, 28, and 52 
weeks. All reports of serious adverse events and 
all trial deaths were adjudicated by an indepen-
dent adjudication committee whose members 
were unaware of the treatment assignments.
Statistical Analysis
It was estimated a priori that the annual rate of 
moderate or severe exacerbations would be 0.80 
among patients treated with triple therapy, 0.91 
among those treated with fluticasone furoate–
vilanterol, and 0.94 among those treated with 
umeclidinium–vilanterol. On the basis of a two-
sided 1% significance level and 90% power and 
assuming a negative binomial model with a 
dispersion parameter of 0.75, we calculated that 
approximately 4000 patients would be needed in 
the triple-therapy group, 4000 in the fluticasone 
furoate–vilanterol group, and 2000 in the ume-
clidinium–vilanterol group. The truncated Hoch-
berg method was used in a closed testing hier-
archy across the coprimary and key secondary 
treatment comparisons to control type I error at

performed in the intention-to-treat population, 
except for the TDI, which was assessed in a sub-
set of 5058 patients. Further details are provided

Results
Trial Population
The intention-to-treat population included 10,355 
patients who underwent randomization and re-
ceived investigational medication (4151 received 
triple therapy, 4134 received fluticasone furoate–
vilanterol, and 2070 received umeclidinium–
vilanterol). Overall, 9087 patients (88%) complet-
ed the trial, and 7991 (77%) completed the trial 
while receiving investigational medication (Fig. S1 
in the Supplementary Appendix). In the intention-
to-treat population, there were no clinically sig-
nificant differences among the three treatment 
groups with regard to baseline demographic 
characteristics, COPD exacerbations, lung func-
tion, and CAT score (Table 1). The majority of 
patients (66%) were male, and the mean age was 
65.3 years. A total of 18% of the patients had 
bronchodilator reversibility (defined as an in-
crease in FEV1 of ≥12% and ≥200 ml after ad-
ministration of albuterol). A total of 43% had a 
baseline blood eosinophil level of less than 150 
cells per microliter.

Triple vs. Dual Therapy in Patients with COPD
ceiving triple therapy including an inhaled gluco-
corticoid, a LABA, and a LAMA; 29% were re-
ceiving an inhaled glucocorticoid and a LABA; 
and 8% were receiving a LAMA and a LABA. De-
tails on medications at trial entry are provided 
in Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix. After 
the initiation of investigational medication, the 
rate of premature discontinuation of treatment 
was lower in the triple-therapy group than in the 
dual-therapy groups; 758 patients (18%) with-
drew from triple therapy, 1040 (25%) from flutic-
asone furoate–vilanterol, and 566 (27%) from 
umeclidinium–vilanterol.
Primary Efficacy Analysis
The rate of moderate or severe exacerbations 
during treatment among patients assigned to 
triple therapy was 0.91 per year, as compared 
with 1.07 per year among those assigned to 
fluticasone furoate–vilanterol (rate ratio with 
triple therapy, 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.80 to 0.90; 15% difference; P<0.001) and 1.21 
per year among those assigned to umeclidinium–
vilanterol (rate ratio with triple therapy, 0.75; 
95% CI, 0.70 to 0.81; 25% difference; P<0.001). 
Thus, the rate of moderate or severe exacerba-
tions was significantly lower with the combina-
tion of fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium, and 
vilanterol than with fluticasone furoate–vilanterol 
or umeclidinium–vilanterol (Fig. 1A).
Secondary Efficacy Analyses
Triple therapy was associated with a lower risk 
of moderate or severe exacerbations during treat-
ment than dual therapy, as assessed in a time-to-
first-event analysis. The hazard ratio for triple 
therapy versus fluticasone furoate–vilanterol was 
0.85 (95% CI, 0.80 to 0.91; 15% difference; 
P<0.001), and the hazard ratio for triple therapy 
versus umeclidinium–vilanterol was 0.84 (95% CI, 
0.78 to 0.91; 16% difference; P<0.001) (Fig. 1B).
The annual rate of moderate or severe exacer-
bations was lower with triple therapy than with 
either dual-therapy combination, regardless of 
eosinophil level, although a greater reduction in 
the exacerbation rate was observed in patients 
with eosinophil levels of at least 150 cells per 
microliter. Among patients with eosinophil levels 
of less than 150 cells per microliter, the annual 
rate of moderate or severe exacerbations was 0.85 
(95% CI, 0.80 to 0.91) with triple therapy, 1.06 
(95% CI, 0.99 to 1.14) with fluticasone furoate–
vilanterol, and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.88 to 1.07) with 
umeclidinium–vilanterol. Among patients with

eosinophil levels of at least 150 cells per micro-
liter, the annual rate was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.90 to 
1.01) with triple therapy, 1.08 (95% CI, 1.02 
to 1.14) with fluticasone furoate–vilanterol, and 
1.39 (95% CI, 1.29 to 1.51) with umeclidinium–
vilanterol.
The annual rate of severe exacerbations dur-
ing treatment was 0.13 among patients assigned 
to triple therapy, 0.15 among those assigned to 
fluticasone furoate–vilanterol (rate ratio with 
triple therapy, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.01; 13% 
difference; P 
= 
0.06), and 0.19 among those as-
signed to umeclidinium–vilanterol (rate ratio with 
triple therapy, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.78; 34% 
difference; P<0.001). Thus, the rate was not sig-
nificantly lower with triple therapy than with 
fluticasone furoate–vilanterol but was significant-
ly lower with triple therapy than with umecli-
dinium–vilanterol.
For the spirometric outcome of the mean 
change from baseline in trough FEV1, the differ-
ence between the triple-therapy and fluticasone 
furoate–vilanterol groups was 97 ml (95% CI, 85 
to 109; P<0.001), and the difference between the 
triple-therapy and umeclidinium–vilanterol groups 
was 54 ml (95% CI, 39 to 69; P<0.001). There 
were significant differences between the triple-
therapy group and the fluticasone furoate–
vilanterol and umeclidinium–vilanterol groups 
in the mean change from baseline in the SGRQ 
total score and in the percentage of patients who 
had a response as defined by a decrease in the 
SGRQ total score of at least 4 points (P<0.001 for 
both comparisons on both outcomes) (Table 2).
Analyses of Other Outcomes
All tests within the predefined statistical testing 
hierarchy achieved statistical significance, with 
P<0.001. No adjustments for multiplicity were 
made for the other comparisons, and P values of 
less than 0.05 were considered to indicate statis-
tical significance. Beyond the prespecified pri-
mary and secondary outcomes, there were multi-
ple prespecified protocol-defined other outcomes, 
among which were death from any cause during 
treatment, all exacerbations (mild, moderate, or 
severe), and dyspnea according to the TDI. Re-
sults for these other outcomes provided support 
for the primary findings, although treatment 
comparisons were not corrected for multiplicity.

Triple vs. Dual Therapy in Patients with COPD
Death during treatment occurred in 50 patients 
(1%) in the triple-therapy group, 49 patients (1%) 
in the fluticasone furoate–vilanterol group, and 
39 patients (2%) in the umeclidinium–vilanterol 
group. All-cause mortality was significantly low-
er with the regimens that included the inhaled 
glucocorticoid fluticasone furoate (triple therapy 
and fluticasone furoate–vilanterol) than with 
umeclidinium–vilanterol. The hazard ratio for 
triple therapy versus umeclidinium–vilanterol was 
0.58 (95% CI, 0.38 to 0.88; 42% difference; un-
adjusted P 
= 
0.01), and the hazard ratio for flutic-
asone furoate–vilanterol versus umeclidinium–
vilanterol was 0.61 (95% CI, 0.40 to 0.93; 39% 
difference; unadjusted P 
= 
0.02). The results of a 
prespecified analysis of the time to death from 
any cause including data from patients during 
treatment and not during treatment provided 
support for the findings during treatment. Fur-
ther details are provided in the Supplementary 
Appendix.
An analysis of adjudicated cause–specific death 
during treatment showed a lower rate of deaths 
from both cardiovascular and respiratory causes 
in the inhaled-glucocorticoid groups than in the 
umeclidinium–vilanterol group. There were 16 ad-
judicated cardiovascular deaths during treatment 
in the triple-therapy group, 21 in the fluticasone 
furoate–vilanterol group, and 15 in the umecli-
dinium–vilanterol group (rate per 1000 patient-
years, 4.2, 6.0, and 8.7, respectively). There were 
15 adjudicated deaths from respiratory causes 
during treatment in the triple-therapy group, 12 
in the fluticasone furoate–vilanterol group, and 
9 in the umeclidinium–vilanterol group (rate per 
1000 patient-years, 4.0, 3.4, and 5.2, respectively). 
The rate of deaths that were associated with the 
patients’ underlying COPD according to the in-
dependent adjudicators was lower in the inhaled-
glucocorticoid groups than in the umeclidinium–
vilanterol group. There were 18 deaths during 
treatment that were determined to be associated 
with the patient’s COPD in the triple-therapy group, 
14 in the fluticasone furoate–vilanterol group, and 
15 in the umeclidinium–vilanterol group (rate per 
1000 patient-years, 4.8, 4.0, and 8.7, respective-
ly). Similar results were observed in an analysis 
that included deaths that occurred in patients no 
longer receiving treatment. For a summary of 
adjudicated causes of death, see Tables S9 and 
S10 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Findings similar to those of the primary effi-
cacy analysis were observed when mild exacerba-
tions (those determined to require only increased 
albuterol) were included. The annual rate of mild, 
moderate, or severe exacerbations was 1.05 with 
triple therapy, 1.25 with fluticasone furoate–
vilanterol, and 1.40 with umeclidinium–vilanterol. 
The rate was 16% lower with triple therapy than 
with fluticasone furoate–vilanterol (rate ratio, 
0.84; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.89; P<0.001) and 25% 
lower with triple therapy than with umeclidinium–
vilanterol (rate ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.81; 
P<0.001).
In a subset of 5058 patients, the percentage of 
patients who had a response as defined by an 
increase in the TDI of at least 1 unit was higher 
with triple therapy than with either dual therapy. 
The rate of response was 36% in the triple-
therapy group, 29% in the fluticasone furoate–
vilanterol group, and 30% in the umeclidinium–
vilanterol group. The odds ratio for response 
was 1.36 for triple therapy versus fluticasone 
furoate–vilanterol (95% CI, 1.19 to 1.55; P<0.001) 
and 1.33 for triple therapy versus umeclidinium–
vilanterol (95% CI, 1.13 to 1.57; P<0.001).
Safety and Adverse-Event Profile
Overall, the adverse-event profile of triple ther-
apy was similar to that of the dual-therapy com-
parators, and there were no new safety findings 
associated with the use of an inhaled glucocorti-
coid, a LAMA, or a LABA in combination (Table 3). 
There were no clinically relevant differences in 
ECG measurements, vital signs, or clinical labo-
ratory values among the treatment groups.
The incidence of adverse events during treat-
ment that led to discontinuation of trial treat-
ment or withdrawal from the trial was 6% for 
triple therapy, 8% for fluticasone furoate–
vilanterol, and 9% for umeclidinium–vilanterol; 
the incidence of discontinuation or withdrawal 
due to an adverse event of COPD was 2%, 2%, 
and 3%, respectively. Serious adverse events dur-
ing treatment occurred in 895 patients (22%) 
receiving triple therapy, 850 (21%) receiving 
fluticasone furoate–vilanterol, and 470 (23%) 
receiving umeclidinium–vilanterol. A total of 14 
patients (<1%) receiving triple therapy, 25 (<1%) 
receiving fluticasone furoate–vilanterol, and 14 
(<1%) receiving umeclidinium–vilanterol were 
reported to have had a nonserious adverse event

of COPD worsening. A serious adverse event of 
pneumonia occurred in 184 patients (4%), 152 
patients (4%), and 54 patients (3%), respectively. 
Further details are provided in Table S12 in the 
Supplementary Appendix.
There was a higher incidence of pneumonia 
in the inhaled-glucocorticoid groups than in the 
umeclidinium–vilanterol group, and the risk of 
clinician-diagnosed pneumonia was significant-
ly higher with triple therapy than with umecli-
dinium–vilanterol, as assessed in a time-to-first-
event analysis (hazard ratio, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.22 
to 1.92; P<0.001). There was no significant dif-
ference in the risk of pneumonia between triple 
therapy and fluticasone furoate–vilanterol (haz-
ard ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.19; P 
= 
0.85).
Discussion
In this trial, once-daily single-inhaler triple 
therapy with fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium, 
and vilanterol resulted in a significantly lower 
rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations 
and better lung function and health-related 
quality of life than dual therapy with fluticasone 
furoate–vilanterol or the dual bronchodilator 
umeclidinium–vilanterol among patients with 
symptomatic COPD and a history of exacerba-
tions. These benefits were observed regardless 
of the patients’ blood eosinophil levels at ran-
domization.
Our trial also showed that fluticasone furoate–
vilanterol was superior to umeclidinium–vilanterol 
with respect to the rates of COPD exacerbations 
(moderate or severe exacerbations and all exacer-
bations). These findings are in contrast to those 
of the FLAME trial,17 which showed a benefit of 
LAMA–LABA over inhaled glucocorticoid–LABA 
for the prevention of exacerbations. This differ-
ence in findings between our trial and the 
FLAME trial is probably due to the differences in 
the patient populations and the design of the 
two trials. In the FLAME trial, all the patients 
were treated with tiotropium during a 1-month 
run-in period. Therefore, any patients who would 
require an inhaled glucocorticoid may have had 
an increase in exacerbations and a decrease in 
lung function during the run-in period and would 
have been forced to leave the trial. In addition, 
it is also possible that patients who could not

Triple vs. Dual Therapy in Patients with COPD
withdraw from an inhaled glucocorticoid were 
knowingly not enrolled, leading to a biased pa-
tient population. In contrast, patients in our trial 
who were assigned to the LAMA–LABA group 
and had been previously receiving an inhaled 
glucocorticoid would have had to abruptly stop 
the inhaled glucocorticoid, whereas patients in 
the inhaled-glucocorticoid groups would have 
continued to take an inhaled glucocorticoid. It is 
unknown whether the abrupt discontinuation of 
inhaled glucocorticoids could have contributed 
to our finding of a lower rate of exacerbations in 
the inhaled-glucocorticoid groups than in the 
LAMA–LABA group. In addition, the patients who 
were assigned to the triple-therapy group and had 
been previously receiving an inhaled glucocorti-
coid, a LABA, and a LAMA might not have been 
expected to have a benefit. Further research using 
different trial designs will be needed to resolve 
these issues.
Triple therapy and fluticasone furoate–vilanterol 
also showed a signal toward lower all-cause 
mortality during treatment than umeclidinium–
vilanterol. However, the Study to Understand 
Mortality and Morbidity in COPD (SUMMIT),18 
involving patients with moderate COPD and 
heightened cardiovascular risk, was powered to 
study all-cause mortality and did not show a sig-
nificant effect for fluticasone furoate–vilanterol. 
It is possible that our finding is fragile; further 
investigation will be needed to understand the 
reasons for this finding.
The strengths of the IMPACT trial include the 
large number of patients enrolled and the com-
parison of triple therapy with dual therapies us-
ing the same molecules in the same delivery de-
vice. The trial used an electronic diary for rapid 
and reliable identification of symptoms sugges-
tive of an exacerbation, and the measurement of 
health-related quality of life has been recognized 
as important to help physicians and patients 
achieve greater understanding of a treatment ef-
fect.19 A robust approach was taken for capture 
and evaluation of pneumonias to ensure that 
expected adverse events of pneumonia were ap-
propriately understood.
Safety results showed a higher incidence of 
pneumonia in the inhaled-glucocorticoid groups 
than in the umeclidinium–vilanterol group, as 
would be expected. However, the rate of pneu-
monia was 95.8, 96.6, and 61.2 events per 1000 
patient-years with triple therapy, fluticasone 
furoate–vilanterol, and umeclidinium–vilanterol, 
respectively, whereas the rate of moderate or 
severe COPD exacerbations was 922.8, 1051.5, 
and 1147.6 events per 1000 patient-years, respec-
tively. No new safety signals emerged.11,18
In summary, the results of the IMPACT trial 
show that a once-daily combination of flutica-
sone furoate, umeclidinium, and vilanterol re-
sulted in a lower rate of moderate or severe 
COPD exacerbations and better lung function 
and health-related quality of life than dual ther-
apy with fluticasone furoate–vilanterol or umecli-
dinium–vilanterol. Triple therapy also resulted 
in a lower rate of hospitalization due to COPD 
than umeclidinium–vilanterol in this symptom-
atic patient population.
