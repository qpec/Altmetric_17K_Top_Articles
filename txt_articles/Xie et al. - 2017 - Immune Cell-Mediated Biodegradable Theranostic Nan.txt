Abstract
Although tremendous efforts have been made on targeted drug delivery systems, current therapy 
outcomes still suffer from low circulating time and limited targeting efficiency. The integration of 
cell-mediated drug delivery and theranostic nanomedicine can potentially improve cancer 
management in both therapeutic and diagnostic applications. By taking advantage of innate 
immune cell’s ability to target tumor cells, we developed a novel drug delivery system by using 
macrophages as both nanoparticle-carriers and navigators to achieve cancer-specific drug delivery. 
Theranostic nanoparticles were fabricated from a unique polymer, biodegradable 
photoluminescent poly (lactic acid) (BPLP-PLA), which possesses strong fluorescence, 
biodegradability, and cytocompatibility. In order to minimize the toxicity of cancer drugs to 
immune cells and other healthy cells, an anti-BRAF V600E mutant melanoma specific drug 
(PLX4032) was loaded into BPLP-PLA nanoparticles. Muramyl tripeptide (MTP) was also 
conjugated onto the nanoparticles to improve the nanoparticle loading efficiency. The resulting 
nanoparticles were internalized within macrophages, which were tracked via the intrinsic 
fluorescence of BPLP-PLA. Macrophages carrying nanoparticles delivered drugs to melanoma 
cells via cell-cell binding. Pharmacological studies also indicated that the PLX4032 loaded 
nanoparticles effectively killed melanoma cells. Our “self-powered” immune cell-mediated drug 
delivery system demonstrates a potentially significant advancement in targeted theranostic cancer 
nanotechnologies.

1. Introduction
Nanotechnology plays a crucial role in modern medicine, especially in targeted cancer drug 
delivery and imaging[1]. Nanocarriers provide protection for chemotherapeutics, genes, and 
imaging agents against the harsh environment encountered in systemic circulation[2]. 
Compared to conventional systematic delivery and passive targeting, active targeted delivery 
of nanoparticles improves the therapeutic index and reduces side effects as well as 
minimizes immunogenicity[3, 4]. Most existing active targeting strategies utilize surface 
molecules such as antibodies, proteins, aptamers, peptides, or small molecules to recognize 
receptors that are expressed or overexpressed in cancer cells or cancer microenvironments[5, 
6]. However, despite tremendous efforts towards discovering surface markers and targeting 
molecules, existing nanomedicine still fails to meet the expectations of efficient delivery of 
therapeutics to specific tumors via intravenous injection[5, 7]. The major limitations are low 
circulation time and poor target selectivity for a specific disease or cancer. The complexity 
of living systems makes specific recognition chance-dependent, which compromises the 
effectiveness of drug delivery systems. Thus there is an urgent need to develop “true” 
specific targeting strategies for cancer treatment.
In recent years, circulating cells such as immune cells have gained interest as novel “living” 
delivery vehicles[8, 9]. Research has shown that leukocytes are capable of homing into 
tumor sites and regulating metastasis by adhesion molecule-mediated interactions with 
circulating tumor cells (CTCs)[10–12]. Such evidence points to the rational design of using 
immune cells as “smart” vehicles for cancer targeting and therapeutics delivery. For 
example, Choi et al. demonstrated that macrophages could be manipulated as “Trojan 
Horses” to deliver gold nanoparticles to breast tumors and brain metastases[13, 14]. A 
similar concept was used to guide gold nanoshells to brain gliomas for photothermal therapy 
via macrophages[15]. These studies, however, only focused on using macrophages as 
delivery carriers to reach tumor sites. As such, the potential of leukocytes targeting 
circulating cancer cells under dynamic blood stream conditions remained relatively 
unknown. Recently, leukocytes were functionalized with tumor necrosis factor-related 
apoptosis-inducing ligands (TRAIL)/E-selectin adhesion receptors to kill cancer cells in the 
circulation[16–18], providing insight into immune cell-meditated targeting. These studies

 suggest that utilizing immune cells as carriers to mediate therapeutic nanoparticles is an 
attractive approach for targeted drug delivery.
Today, significant leaps are being made in nanomedicine by integrating controlled drug 
delivery with imaging-based diagnosis, resulting in a new, emerging field of theranostic 
nanomedicine. Advances in fluorescence imaging techniques have enabled early detection of 
cancer and real-time monitoring of the drug delivery processes. However, living cell-
mediated theranostic drug delivery has not been widely investigated, partly because 
fluorescence imaging agents such as organic dyes, green fluorescence proteins, and quantum 
dots generally suffer from poor stability, solubility, and potential cellular toxicity[19]. Due 
to these major drawbacks, traditional fluorescence imaging materials cannot be used as drug 
delivery carriers alone, but must undergo conjugation or encapsulation steps, contributing to 
unfavorable drug release profiles that are difficult to control.
To overcome these unmet challenges, we herein report the development of theranostic 
immune cell-mediated biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles with intrinsic fluorescence in 
order to enable carrier cell imaging with improved photostability and reduced cytotoxicity, 
as well as better control over cancer-specific drug release. This novel polymeric nanoparticle 
is synthesized from biodegradable photoluminescent poly (lactic acid) (BPLP-PLA), which 
is a fully degradable polymer with tunable intrinsic fluorescence as we reported 
previously[20]. BPLP-PLA possesses strong and stable fluorescence for optical imaging, 
along with good cytocompatibility on par with widely used PLA in FDA approved devices 
[20]. The degradation rates of BPLP-PLA can also be easily tuned to achieve controlled drug 
delivery, making BPLP-PLA an ideal biomaterial for theranostic drug delivery. To the best 
of our knowledge, no study has reported controlled delivery of biodegradable polymeric 
nanoparticles by using immune cells for cancer treatment.
For this study, THP-1 cells were selected as the nanoparticle carrier in order to model 
monocyte/macrophage systems, while the theranostic nanoparticles were equipped with 
melanoma-specific drugs to target melanoma cells. THP-1 is a human leukemia cell line that 
is widely used as a monocytic model for mnonocyte-macrophage differentiation and has 
affinities to cancer cells and other inflammatory cells[21]. To minimize the adverse effects 
on leukocytes and maximize the antitumor effects on cancer cells, PLX4032 (also known as 
Vemurafenib; a drug specifically designed for treating BRAF V600E mutated melanomas) 
was selected as the therapeutic agent and encapsulated within BPLP-PLA nanoparticles 
(BPLP-PLA-PLX4032)[22]. To further improve the THP-1 cellular uptake efficiency of 
nanoparticles, muramyl tripeptide (MTP)[23] was conjugated onto drug-loaded 
nanoparticles to form a complex named MTP-BPLP-PLA-PLX4032. The design of our 
nanoparticles and immune cell-mediated targeting strategy for melanoma cells is illustrated 
in Figure 1.
2. Results and Discussions
2.1. Fabrication and Characterization of BPLP-PLA Nanoparticles
Biodegradable BPLP-PLA was used in this study for immune cell-mediated delivery to 
bridge the limitations of existing immune cell-mediated nanoparticle delivery strategies that

 utilize inorganic nanoparticles, as well as of liposomes that lack theranostic capabilities and 
a controlled drug release mechanism[13, 14, 16]. BPLP-PLA copolymer with intrinsic 
fluorescence was synthesized as we reported previously[20, 24]. As mentioned above, 
varying the BPLP to L-lactide molar ratio allows control over the degradation rate[20]. A 
BPLP to L-lactide ratio of 1:50 was used in this study to ensure minimal degradation and 
drug release in the initial 24 hours, which is the time window for immune cells to uptake 
nanoparticles and further bind to melanoma cells[25]. BPLP-PLA nanoparticles were 
fabricated by a single emulsion method[20, 24]. In order to increase THP-1 cell targeting 
efficiency, we further modified drug-laden nanoparticles with MTP, which has macrophage 
immuno-potentiating effects without significant cytotoxicity[26–28]. MTP was successfully 
conjugated with BPLP-PLA and BPLP-PLA-PLX4032 nanoparticles by carbodiimide 
chemistry, as confirmed by FTIR (Supporting Information Figure S1). The increments of –
NH stretching and –(C=O)N- stretching indicate the presence of peptides on BPLP-PLA 
nanoparticles.
PLX4032 was selected as a drug for encapsulation as it is specific for inhibiting BRAF 
(V600E) mutation melanoma[22, 29, 30]. PLX4032-encapsulated BPLP-PLA nanoparticles 
were fabricated by the same single emulsion method by mixing PLX4032 into BPLP-PLA 
solution with a ratio of 1:5 w/w. The drug loading efficiency was 54% as determined by 
HPLC (Supporting Information Figure S2). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of 
PLX4032-loaded nanoparticles (BPLP-PLA-PLX4032) and MTP-modified BPLP-PLA-
PLX4032 nanoparticles (MTP-BPLP-PLA-PLX4032) are shown in Figure 2A. The average 
diameters of BPLP-PLA-PLX4032 and MTP-BPLP-PLA-PLX4032 nanoparticles as 
determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) were 217.2 nm (PDI: 0.147) and 209.1 nm 
(PDI: 0.121) (Figure. 2B and 2C), respectively. The results were consistent with those from 
SEM images. Zeta potentials of our nanoparticles were -30.3 mV and -36.2 mV, suggesting 
that they can be stable in physiological solutions[31].
Finally, we examined the effects of nanoparticle fabrication on the fluorescence properties of 
BPLP-PLA. In our previous work, we found that BPLP-PLA exhibits intrinsic fluorescence 
and band shifting emission with different excitation wavelengths[20, 24]. Here, our 
nanoparticles maintained strong fluorescence emission, tunable up to 700 nm by varying the 
excitation wavelength (Figure 2D). The intrinsic fluorescence of nanoparticles enables in 
vitro visualization without secondary labeling with traditional imaging agents such as 
organic dyes and quantum dots that often demonstrate significant toxicity. BPLP-PLA also 
possesses excellent photostability, which is desirable for cell tracking applications [20, 32].
2.2. THP-1 Cellular Uptake of Drug-loaded Nanoparticles
As a well-established native monocyte-derived macrophage model[33], THP-1 cell was 
chosen for this study to demonstrate macrophage uptake of drug-laden nanoparticles. Hence 
BPLP-PLA-PLX4032 or MTP-conjugated nanoparticles were incubated with THP-1 cells 
for two hours on a rocker, followed by washing steps to remove unbound nanoparticles. 
Preliminary confocal microscopy studies suggested that our nanoparticles were surface-
bound and internalized by THP-1 cells, and that cellular fluorescence could be detected in 
both FITC and PE-Texas Red channels due to the intrinsic variable fluorescence of BPLP-

 PLA nanoparticles (Figure 3A). Indeed, flow cytometry confirmed that both FITC and PE-
Texas Red signals from nanoparticle-laden THP-1 cells increased after the extracellular 
fluorescence was quenched by trypan blue, further suggesting that the nanoparticles were 
internalized by THP-1 cells (Figure 3B). These results demonstrate the versatility and 
effectiveness of BPLP-PLA nanoparticles in cellular imaging and tracking, since the band 
shifting behavior resulted from the use of different excitation wavelengths (Figure 2D) 
enables a wide range of detection channels, even to red fluorescence.
Since MTP is a macrophage activator known to enhance nanoparticle uptake[23], MTP was 
conjugated to BPLP-PLA-PLX4032 to correlate enhancement of FITC and PE-Texas Red 
signals to nanoparticle internalization. It is clear that both FITC and PE-Texas Red 
fluorescence increased with MTP-conjugated nanoparticles from a greater extent of 
nanoparticle internalization by THP-1 cells (Figure 3C–D). Quantitatively, the average FITC 
and PE-Texas Red intensities of THP-1 cells treated with MTP-BPLP-PLA-PLX4032 
nanoparticles were stronger than those with just BPLP-PLA-PLX4032 nanoparticles (Figure 
3C), suggesting that MTP conjugation increased the nanoparticle loading efficiency of 
THP-1 cells. The nanoparticle loading efficiency (how many cell have nanoparticles attached 
or internalized) was determined by the percentage of cells in Q1, Q2, and Q3 that had 
increased fluorescence. About 96% of the THP-1 cells were labeled by MTP-conjugated 
BPLP-PLA-PLX4032 nanoparticles, whereas 61% of the THP-1 cells were marked by 
pristine BPLP-PLA-PLX4032 nanoparticles. Thus MTP conjugation was shown to improve 
nanoparticle binding to THP-1 cells. Additionally, the protein corona effect is considered to 
play a negligible role in affecting the overall internalization efficiency of THP-1 cells even 
in physiological relevant conditions (i.e. protein-containing medium) based on a recent 
study, which suggests that a protein-containing medium or complete cell medium does not 
result in significant change on the overall internalization efficiency of differentiated, 
macrophage-like THP-1 cells[34].
We also studied CD11b (an alpha chain of the β2 integrin MAC-1) expression to determine 
whether nanoparticle internalization affects THP-1’s macrophage-like functionality. Studies 
have indicated that polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) bind to melanoma cells in the 
blood circulation through β2 integrins of PMNs and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 
(ICAM-1) of melanoma cells[35]. We hypothesized that macrophages such as THP-1, upon 
PMA (Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate)-induced CD11b expression, have this same 
melanoma binding ability through ICAM-1[36–38]. Thus, the maintenance of CD11b would 
be critical in binding melanoma. First, we showed that macrophage-like phenotype from 
differentiated THP-1 cells (induced by PMA) could be identified by CD11b expression 
(from the fluorescence of Alexa647) (Supporting Information Figure S3). Next, confocal 
microscopy and 3D flow cytometry plots showed strong immunofluorescence from 
Alexa647 (in addition to the FITC and PE-Texas Red fluorescence signals from the 
nanoparticles), indicating that THP-1 cells still expressed CD11b after taking up 
nanoparticles (Figure 3A and Supporting Information Figure S4), thereby suggesting that the 
encapsulation of nanoparticles did not alter THP-1’s functionality as a macrophage-like cell. 
These results showed that BPLP-PLA-PLX4032 nanoparticles were picked up and 
internalized by THP-1 cells while MTP conjugation increased loading efficiency without 
affecting THP-A macrophage-like functionality. Based on these results, MTP-BPLP-PLA-

 PLX4032 nanoparticles were deemed suitable for follow-up experiments on melanoma 
binding and therapeutic studies.
2.3. THP-1 Cell-mediated Nanoparticle delivery to Melanoma Cells
Tumor progression is a complex and dynamic process involving immune cells and tumor 
cells, as tumor cell subpopulations are susceptible to recognition and destruction by immune 
cells[39]. In particular, macrophages are major players in the tumor microenvironment and 
are involved in chronic inflammation, matrix remodeling, tumor cell invasion, intravasation, 
angiogenesis, and metastasis[40]. This central role of leukocytes on tumor cell 
immunosurveillance highlights the value of utilizing macrophages as nanoparticle “carriers” 
to target cancer cells and deliver drugs.
To demonstrate such value in immune cell-mediated theranostic drug delivery, the next step 
was to assess the effectiveness of THP-1 cell binding and MTP-BPLP-PLA-PLX4032 
nanoparticle delivery to melanoma cells. 1205Lu cells and WM35 cells were chosen as 
models for high and low metastatic melanoma cells respectively, and co-culture studies were 
performed under both static and dynamic conditions to model laminar and shear flow 
conditions[41]. First, bare THP-1 cells without nanoparticles were co-cultured with either 
type of melanoma cells for two hours under static conditions (on a rocker) to demonstrate 
that THP-1 cells are able to attach to melanoma cells (Supporting Information Figure S5). 
Next, THP-1 cells loaded with MTP-BPLP-PLA-PLX4032 nanoparticles (with a two hour 
incubation and washing steps) were co-cultured with either type of melanoma cells for two 
hours under static or dynamic conditions.
Nanoparticle-laden THP-1 cells were able to successfully bind to GFP-1205Lu cells as 
determined by confocal microscopy (Figure 4A). To better show THP-1/melanoma cell 
binding for confocal microscopy and quantitative flow cytometry analysis, 1205Lu cells 
were tagged with Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP-1205Lu) and WM35 cells were stained 
with CellTrace™ CFSE. Since GFP intensity is much greater than BPLP-PLA nanoparticle 
intensity at the FITC channel, nanoparticle-labeled THP-1 cells emit minimal fluorescence 
at the FITC channel at an exposure time suitable for GFP-labeled melanoma cells (Figure 
4A). Likewise, GFP-labeled melanoma cells emit minimal red fluorescence compared to 
nanoparticle-labeled THP-1. Thus, intensity along the FITC channel indicated melanoma 
cells, whereas intensity along the PE-Texas Red channel indicated BPLP-PLA nanoparticles, 
thereby enabling qualitative and quantitative discriminatory analysis. Next, flow cytometer 
analysis was performed to quantitatively evaluate this binding. Compared to untreated 
GFP-1205Lu cells that show no fluorescence in the PE-Texas Red channel, co-culturing with 
nanoparticle-bearing THP-1 cells induced the population of GFP-1205Lu cells to shift into 
the Q2 region with a greater degree of red fluorescence (Figure 4B). This enhanced red 
fluorescence indicates binding of GFP-1205Lu cells with nanoparticle-bearing THP-1 cells 
to form leukocyte/nanoparticle/melanoma complexes, or transference of nanoparticles from 
THP-1 to GFP-1205Lu upon binding. In fact, confocal microscopy images showed trace red 
fluorescence within GFP-1205Lu cells, supporting nanoparticles released from THP-1 cells 
to GFP-1205Lu cells (Figure 4A). It is likely that nanoparticles were released via exocytosis, 
owing to the equilibrium of engulfing foreign substances and liberating engulfed particles, 
Xie et al.

 particularly since BPLP-PLA nanoparticles are constructed by a polyester copolymer with 
minimal charges[42]. Previous studies suggested that neutrally charged nanoparticles were 
able to transport out of macrophages significantly faster than cationic nanoparticles[43].
In order to mimic the dynamic shear-flow environments of the bloodstream, GFP-1205Lu 
cells were exposed to nanoparticle-carrying THP-1 cells on a cone-plate viscometer. As 
shown in Figure 4, confocal microscopy and flow cytometry results showed that THP-1 cells 
were bound to GFP-1205Lu cells even under shear flow. Lastly, FACS analysis was 
performed to quantify the binding efficiency of THP-1 and melanoma cells, which is defined 
as the ratio of the cells in Q2 to the cells in both Q1 and Q2. Over 90% of 1205Lu cells were 
bound to nanoparticle-laden THP-1 cells or received nanoparticles via exocytosis when 
shear rates ranged from 50 s−1 to 200 s−1, which is the relatively lower range of the blood 
wall shear rate[44]. These numbers suggest that nanoparticle-carrying THP-1 cells adhere to 
melanoma cells. This macrophage-mediated delivery strategy is also verified by a low 
metastatic melanoma cell line, WM35. Similar results were observed, indicating THP-1/
WM35 binding and nanoparticle transportation to WM35, as shown in Supporting 
Information Figure S6 Thus, in vitro binding was demonstrated between THP-1 cells and 
melanoma cells, as well as THP-1 cell-mediated nanoparticle delivery.
2.4. Pharmacological Studies
Since we have verified the binding and nanoparticle delivery capabilities of THP-1 cells to 
melanoma cells, the final step was to examine the safety of our immune cell-mediated 
nanoparticle delivery system and its pharmacological effects on cancer cells. In order to 
minimize the potential damage to immune cells and normal tissues, PLX4032 was used as 
an anti-cancer drug that specifically inhibits the BRAF oncogene of V600E-mutated positive 
melanomas[45, 46] which prevents melanoma cell extravasation and subsequent 
metastasis[29, 30]. We investigated two melanoma cell lines, 1205Lu (high metastatic) and 
WM35 (low metastatic), which are both BRAF mutants with V600E expression[22, 46]. 
First, we found that free PLX4032 itself selectively killed 1205Lu and WM35 at 
concentrations of 50 ng/mL (Figure 5A). With PLX4032 concentration above 5 μg/mL, 
almost 100% death of melanomas was achieved. However, no significant reduction in 
viability of THP-1 cells was observed even with concentrations as high as 100 μg/mL. Thus, 
PLX4032 was determined to be an ideal drug for immune cell-mediated drug delivery to 
melanoma cells, presenting minimal toxicity to the carrier immune cells. Second, in vitro 
drug release studies showed sustained release of PLX4032 from our nanoparticles 
(Supporting Information Figure S7). No clear burst release was observed in the release 
curve, which is important in minimizing side effects and achieving high therapeutic 
outcomes. Third, we tested the effects of drug-free MTP-BPLP-PLA nanoparticles and 
PLX4032-loaded MTP-BPLP-PLA nanoparticles on THP-1 and melanoma cells. As shown 
in Figure 5B, pristine BPLP-PLA nanoparticles lacking the drug did not significantly reduce 
the THP-1 cell viability at nanoparticle concentrations as high as 1000 μg/mL. For 1205Lu 
and WM35 melanomas, however, pristine nanoparticles exhibited toxicity at 500 μg/mL. 
After 7 days of incubation, PLX4032 loaded nanoparticles killed far more melanomas than 
pristine nanoparticles, especially for WM35, which indicated significant difference at 50 
μg/mL of nanoparticles. The cell viability of both 1205Lu and WM35 melanoma cells were

 significantly reduced to around 30% at 1000 μg/mL MTP-BPLP-PLA-PLX4032 
nanoparticle concentrations after seven days of incubation, suggesting that the drug released 
from nanoparticles were effective in killing melanoma cells. Finally, we assessed the 
effectiveness of the complete THP-1-mediated MTP-BPLP-PLA-PLX4032 nanoparticle 
delivery system. THP-1 cells were treated with PLX4032 loaded nanoparticles, and after 
removal of free nanoparticles, THP-1 cells were co-cultured with 1205Lu or WM35 cells (at 
2000 cells per well each) with different THP-1 cell to melanoma cell ratios, including 5000, 
10000, 25000, 50000, and 100000 THP-1 per well, for seven days. Bare THP-1 cells lacking 
nanoparticles served as control. Compared with pristine THP-1 cells, nanoparticle-bearing 
THP-1 significantly decreased the viability of both 1205Lu and WM35 cells; even at the 
lowest THP-1 number (5,000 cells per well), as shown in Figure 5C. With increasing 
number of THP-1 cells added, more melanoma cells were killed, likely due to activated 
macrophages releasing tumor necrosis factor that kill cancer cells[47]. Again, THP-1 cells 
that engulfed PLX4032-loaded nanoparticles further reduced both 1205Lu and WM35 cells 
viabilities than that of pristine THP-1 cells even at higher ratios. Since we have previously 
noted that nanoparticles can be transported from THP-1 cells into melanoma cells (Figure 
4A), it is likely that PLX4032 was released to effectively treat melanomas. Noticeably, 
THP-1 cell-mediated drug delivery was more effective in killing WM35 cells than 1205Lu 
cells, probably because PLX4032 is more effective on WM35 cells[22]. In conclusion, our 
immune cell-mediated nanoparticle delivery strategy is an effective approach to transport 
therapeutics to melanoma cells.
3. Conclusions
In this paper, we developed a novel targeted nanomedicine strategy based on a “living” 
nanoparticle delivery, mediated by immune cells such as macrophages. Our novel 
biodegradable polymeric theranostic nanoparticles encapsulated melanoma specific 
therapeutics, PLX4032, to provide cell tracking capabilities, safe protection towards 
macrophage model cells, THP-1, and controlled release of drugs to cancer cells. High 
THP-1 uptake of nanoparticles was achieved by modifying particles with MTP peptides. The 
active binding of THP-1 cells to melanoma cells was confirmed with and without the 
presence of nanoparticles. Guided by THP-1 cells, nanoparticles were delivered to 
melanoma cells and consequently released drug contents to kill cancer cells. In summary, 
our immune cell-mediated nanoparticle targeting strategy enabled a self-powered effective 
targeted and traceable cancer drug delivery by taking advantage of the nature of interactions 
between immune cells and tumors. This work may potentially innovate immune cell-
mediated systems not only for cancer drug delivery and imaging, but also for other diseases 
that involve innate immune responses.

Polymer Synthesis and Nanoparticle Fabrication
BPLP was synthesized according to our previous protocol with a simple polycondensation of 
reacting citric acid, 1,8-octanediol, and L-serine at 140°C[24]. Next, BPLP-PLA was 
synthesized via a ring-opening polymerization according to our previously reported 
method[20]. The feeding molar ratio of BPLP to L-lactide monomers was 1:50. The 
characterization of BPLP-PLA can be found in our previous reports[20]. BPLP-PLA 
nanoparticles were prepared by a single emulsion method. Briefly, 50 mg BPLP-PLA 
polymer was dissolved in 2 mL chloroform solution, which was added drop-wise into 20 mL 
5wt% poly(vinyl alcohol) (87% hydrolyzed, Mw of 87 kDa) solution during sonication. The 
solution was stirred vigorously overnight for solvent evaporation. Resulting nanoparticles 
were centrifuged at 10, 000 rpm and washed with DI water for three times before 
lyophilized. PLX4032 drug loaded nanoparticles (BPLP-PLA-PLX4032) was prepared by 
dissolving 20 wt% (to BPLP-PLA) of PLX4032 in 200 μL DMSO and mixing with the 
polymer solution, followed by the same single emulsion and washing procedure to obtain 
drug loaded nanoparticles. MTP was conjugated to nanoparticles by carbodiimide chemistry, 
according to an established protocol[48]. Specifically, 40 mg nanoparticles were dispersed in 
20 mL MES buffer (pH 4.5) by sonication. 20 mg 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) 
carbodiimide (EDC) and 20 mg N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) were added sequentially to 
activate the carboxyl groups of BPLP-PLA nanoparticles under stirring for one hour each at 
room temperature. Then, 100 μg MTP was then added into the mixture and stirred for four 
hours. MTP-conjugated nanoparticles were washed by DI water for three times before 
lyophilized as well.

 Nanoparticle Characterization
The particle size, size distribution, and zeta potential of various nanoparticles were measured 
by dynamic light scattering (DLS, Malvern Zetasizer ZS). The chemical structures and 
morphology of nanoparticles were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy 
(FTIR, Bruker Vertex V70) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI Nova NanoSEM 
630). Fluorescence spectra were measured by a fluorescence spectroscope (Horiba FMax-4) 
with a slit size of 2 nm by 2 nm. The concentration of nanoparticles was 20 μg/mL in DPBS. 
The drug loading efficiency was measured by using a high-performance liquid 
chromatography (Shimadzu) equipped with a photodiode array detector (Shimadzu) and a 
Phenomenex Kinetex C18 column. The mobile phase was a mixture of 40% acetonitrile and 
60% DI water, and the flow rate was 1 ml/min. PLX4032 concentration was determined by 
reading the absorbance at 270 nm, and a calibration curve was built on same conditions 
(Supporting Information Figure S2). For drug release tests, 50 mg PLX4032 loaded 
nanoparticles were dispersed in 5 ml of 50 mM PBS in a tube and shaken at 37°C. At each 
time point, the nanoparticles suspension were centrifuged and then 0.5 ml of release solution 
was removed for HPLC measurement. Afterwards, 0.5 ml of fresh PBS was added into the 
tube and followed by re-dispersion.
THP-1 Uptake
Differentiated THP-1 cells were lifted by cell dissociation buffer and used for further 
studies. THP-1 uptake studies were carried out by incubating 1×106 differentiated THP-1 
cells and 200 μg/ml BPLP-PLA and MTP-BPLP-PLA nanoparticles in 1 ml DPBS at 37°C 
for 2 hours on a rocker, respectively. Afterwards, THP-1 cells were washed gently by DPBS 
for three times, and then subjected for characterization and further studies.
Immunofluorescence Staining
To prevent non-specific binding, THP-1 cells were blocked by 1% BSA for 1 hr at room 
temperature and incubated with 2 μg/ml CD11b rat anti-mouse mAb overnight at 4 °C. Cells 
were then stained with Alexa Fluor® 647 Goat anti-rat IgG (H+L) (2 μg/ml) for 1 hr at room 
temperature. THP-1 cells incubated with secondary antibodies served as controls. The cells 
were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 30 minutes and subjected to 
flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. For confocal microscopy, DAPI was used to stain 
the nuclei of THP-1 cells.
Cell Binding Studies under Static Conditions
Two melanoma cell lines, 1205Lu (high metastatic) and WM35 (low metastatic) cells, were 
selected as BRAF positive mutant melanomas. One million nanoparticle-loaded THP-1 cells 
were incubated with one million GFP-tagged 1205Lu cells in 1 ml DPBS at 37°C for two 
hours on a rocker. The resulting cells were gently washed with DPBS for three times and 
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 30 minutes. Cell binding was 
analyzed by using a BD Fortessa LSRII flow cytometry and FACS analysis was performed 
by using FlowJo 10. Confocal microscopy was performed in inverted mode on an Olympus 
Fluorview 100 confocal microscope. For both flow cytometry and microscopy, the FITC 
channel was set to detect the fluorescence from GPF-tagged 1205Lu cells and the Texas Red

 channel was used to detect the fluorescence from BPLP-PLA nanoparticles. For binding 
studies between THP1 and WM35 cells, the WM35 cells were stained by CellTrace™ CFSE 
(Life Technologies) to obtain green fluorescence.
Cell Binding Studies under Shear-Flow Conditions
To simulate the shear-flow conditions of the blood flow, cell binding studies were performed 
in a uniform shear flow by using a cone-plate viscometer (Thermo Scientific). One million 
nanoparticle-loaded THP-1 cells were mixed with GFP-tagged 1205Lu cells at 1:1 ratio in 1 
ml DPBS. The cell mixtures were immediately added into the cone-plate viscometer and 
exposed to shear flows at a range of shear rates that varied from 50 s−1 to 200 s−1 at room 
temperature for one hour. Then, the cells were removed from the cone-plate viscometer and 
washed twice by DPBS. The cells were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature 
for 30 minutes and subjected for confocal and flow cytometry studies as described in the 
section above.
Pharmacological Studies
First, toxicity and selectivity of PLX4032 were confirmed by adding PLX4032 solutions at 
different concentrations into 96 well plates with THP-1, 1205Lu and WM35 cells separately 
(cell seeding density = 5,000 cells per well). After 24 hours of incubation, the cells were 
washed with PBS twice and supplemented with 10 μl CCK-8 in 100 μl RPMI-1640 medium 
in each well. After two hours of incubation, the absorbance at 450 nm of each well was 
measured by a micro-plate reader (TECAN, infinite M200 PRO) and converted to cell 
viability by normalized to the control (tissue culture plates). Next, MTP-BPLP-PLA 
nanoparticles with and without PLX4032 were dispersed in RPMI-1640 medium at various 
concentrations, followed by incubation with THP-1, 1205Lu, and WM35 cells (2,000 cells 
per well) separately in same conditions for seven days. At last, MTP-BPLP-PLA-PLX4032 
loaded THP-1 cells and pristine THP-1 cells were seeded with 1205Lu or WM35 cells 
(2,000 cells per well) together with different ratios for seven days, respectively. Cell viability 
was tested by CCK-8 assays as well.
Statistical Analysis
All data was recorded as mean ± standard error, unless otherwise stated. All statistical 
analyses were performed via one-way ANOVA on GraphPad Prism 6.0. For all studies, n 
equals to 6, unless specifically stated.

Schematic illustration of the immune cell-mediated nanoparticle (NP) delivery system 
targeting to cancer cells. Specifically, PLX4032, an anti-BRAF V600E mutant melanoma 
drug, are loaded within BPLP-PLA nanoparticles. MTP-conjugated BPLP-PLA-PLX4032 
nanoparticles bind to THP-1 macrophages first and they are then delivered to melanoma 
cells via interactions between THP-1 macrophages and melanoma cells. The delivered 
nanoparticles eventually release the PLX4032 drug to kill cancer cells.
