SUMMARY
Loss of the tumor suppressors RB1 and TP53 and MYC amplification are frequent oncogenic 
events in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). We show that Myc expression cooperates with Rb1 and 
Trp53 loss in the mouse lung to promote aggressive, highly metastatic tumors, that are initially 
sensitive to chemotherapy followed by relapse, similar to human SCLC. Importantly, MYC drives 
a neuroendocrine-low “variant” subset of SCLC with high NEUROD1 expression corresponding 
to transcriptional profiles of human SCLC. Targeted drug screening reveals that SCLC with high 
MYC expression is vulnerable to Aurora kinase inhibition, which combined with chemotherapy 
strongly suppresses tumor progression and increases survival. These data identify molecular 
features for patient stratification and uncover a potential targeted treatment approach for MYC-
driven SCLC.
eTOC blurb
Mollaoglu et al. generate a mouse model of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) with elevated Myc 
expression and loss of Rb1 and Trp53. MYC promotes a neuroendocrine-low variant subtype of 
SCLC, which is paralleled in patients. Mouse and human SCLC with high MYC levels display 
sensitivity to Aurora kinase inhibition.

INTRODUCTION
SCLC comprises ~14% of all lung cancers and leads to ~30,000 deaths each year in the 
United States. The average survival time for patients with SCLC is ~10 months, with a two-
year survival rate of only 6% (Kalemkerian et al., 2013; Pietanza et al., 2015). The standard 
systemic therapy for SCLC is platinum-based chemotherapy with etoposide, which has not 
changed for nearly 40 years. While 60–80% of patients respond to chemotherapy, tumors 
rapidly develop resistance with cross-resistance to multiple therapies. SCLC is also highly 
metastatic with 50–80% of patients harboring metastases at the time of autopsy (Elliott et 
al., 1987). These dismal statistics highlight the urgent need for a greater understanding of the 
disease and for new therapeutic approaches (Bunn et al., 2016).
Comprehensive genomic analyses of SCLC have reported loss of function alterations in RB1 
and TP53 in 90–100% of SCLCs (George et al., 2015; Peifer et al., 2012; Rudin et al., 
2012). Amplification of MYC family genes including MYC, MYCL and MYCN, also occur 
in ~20% of tumors and are mutually exclusive (Peifer et al., 2012; Sos et al., 2012). 
Genomic amplifications in MYC have been identified in 6–25% of primary human tumors 
(Gazzeri et al., 1991; George et al., 2015) and in 30–50% of SCLC cell lines (Johnson et al., 
1992; Sos et al., 2012). MYC amplification has been associated with poor outcome, tumor 
progression and treatment resistance, but how MYC impacts these processes has yet to be 
tested in vivo (Brennan et al., 1991; Johnson et al., 1987; Sos et al., 2012).
Human SCLC cell lines have been characterized as classic or variant, with variant lines 
exhibiting faster doubling times, frequent MYC amplification, reduced neuroendocrine 
marker expression and loosely aggregated morphology (Carney et al., 1985; Gazdar et al., 
1985; Johnson et al., 1992; Johnson et al., 1996). Patients for which cell lines harbor MYC 
amplifications demonstrate poor survival compared to those without (Brennan et al., 1991; 
Johnson et al., 1987). The relationship of cell line morphology to human tumors and the 
factors that drive these phenotypes are not well understood; this is partly because biopsies 
from SCLC are small, infrequent and often derived from chemo-naive patients. The 
classification of SCLC includes mixed or “combined” forms of SCLC (Travis et al., 2015), 
and it has been observed that ~10–20% of SCLCs may lack expression of diagnostic 
neuroendocrine markers (George et al., 2015; Rekhtman, 2010; Travis, 2009), but these 
phenotypes currently do not impact therapeutic decisions.
Molecular signatures of tumor heterogeneity in SCLC have been discovered at the level of 
gene expression and methylation patterns, including an inverse relationship between the 
neurogenic transcription factors, Achaete-Scute Homologue 1 (ASCL1) and Neuronal 
Differentiation 1 (NEUROD1) (Borromeo et al., 2016; Poirier et al., 2013; Poirier et al., 
2015). ASCL1, but not NEUROD1, is required for tumorigenesis in a mouse model of 
classic SCLC indicating that ASCL1 is a key driver of at least this subset of tumors

 (Borromeo et al., 2016). In contrast, NEUROD1high signatures are associated with variant 
morphology and MYC amplifications in human cell lines (Borromeo et al., 2016; Poirier et 
al., 2013). Mouse models, however, have not yielded variant, NEUROD1+ tumors, which 
has cast doubt on the physiological relevance of this molecular subset (Borromeo et al., 
2016; Bunn et al., 2016).
Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of SCLC are based on simultaneous loss of 
Rb1 and Trp53 in the mouse lung. Mice develop SCLC with long latency (i.e. 10–15 
months) and tumors frequently harbor Mycl amplifications similar to human SCLC (Calbo 
et al., 2011; Dooley et al., 2011; Meuwissen et al., 2003). Mycl overexpression in 
Rb1fl/fl;Trp53fl/fl mice using a chimeric model accelerates lung tumor formation, 
demonstrating that Mycl is a SCLC driver (Huijbers et al., 2014; Semenova et al., 2015). In 
cooperation with Rb1 and Trp53 loss, deletion of the Rb1 family member Rbl2 (p130) or the 
Pten tumor suppressor shortens tumor latency but mice also develop variable histological 
subtypes (Cui et al., 2014; Gazdar et al., 2015; McFadden et al., 2014; Schaffer et al., 2010). 
Tumors from these GEMMs have been classified histopathologically as classic SCLC, large 
cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) or non-small cell lung cancer with neuroendocrine 
features (NSCLC-NE), but to date none have demonstrated variant SCLC pathology (Bunn 
et al., 2016; Gazdar et al., 2015). Here we describe a new GEMM of SCLC and use 
integrated genomic and transcriptomic analyses of human and murine SCLC to determine 
the impact of MYC on key clinical features of SCLC tumorigenesis and therapeutic response 
in vivo.
RESULTS
MYC promotes rapid SCLC in cooperation with Rb1 and Trp53 loss
We generated knockin Lox-Stop-Lox (LSL)-MycT58A-IRES-Luciferase mice that carry a 
Cre recombinase regulatable MycT58A allele in the H11 locus (Figure S1A). These mice 
were crossed to Rb1fl/flTrp53fl/fl (RP) animals to generate Rb1fl/flTrp53fl/flMycLSL/LSL 
(RPM) mice. Mice were infected intratracheally with adenoviruses carrying Cre driven by a 
neuroendocrine Calcitonin gene-related peptide (Cgrp) promoter. CGRP-expressing cells 
have been demonstrated to be the predominant cell of origin in the RP model of SCLC 
(Sutherland et al., 2011). As a comparison, we infected Rb1fl/flTrp53fl/flPtenfl/fl (RPP) 
animals with Cgrp-Cre viruses, which develop SCLC within 5–8 months (Cui et al., 2014; 
Gazdar et al., 2015; McFadden et al., 2014). Within five weeks of viral infection, some RPM 
mice began to exhibit labored breathing, which necessitated sacrifice. RPM mice had 
significantly increased mortality compared to RPP mice (median survival of 60 days vs. 164 
days, respectively) (Figure 1A). Compared to RPM mice, heterozygous 
Rb1fl/flTrp53fl/flMycLSL/+ (RPMLSL/+) mice had a slightly longer median survival of 81 days 
(Figure S1B). As the RPM mice carry a luciferase allele, we monitored animals using 
bioluminescent imaging and the majority (n = 8 of 11) exhibited a signal in the chest area 
(Figure 1B). Upon sacrifice, lungs were dissected and large tumors were found in the upper 
central airway, usually involving the main bronchi (Figure 1C).
We imaged a separate cohort of RPM mice between 5–7 weeks post Cgrp-Cre infection 
using micro-computed tomography (microCT) imaging. In contrast to adenocarcinomas that

 develop in the distal and peripheral lung (Jackson et al., 2001; Oliver et al., 2010), RPM 
tumors were centrally located, exhibiting a donut-like pattern of density at major bronchi 
and large bronchioles (Figures 1D and 1E). To visualize tumors at earlier stages of 
development, we sacrificed a cohort of mice at 1–4 weeks post-infection (Figures 1F and 
S1C-F). Small proliferating (Ki67+) lesions were evident in or around the airways as early as 
2–3 weeks (Figure S1F). By 5–6 weeks post-infection, tumors exhibited massive lymphatic 
invasion and perivascular and peribronchial spread (Figure 1G). Three board-certified 
pathologists classified all tumors as SCLC. While the overall appearances were consistent 
with human SCLC, tumors contained two populations of cells with distinct morphologies. 
One population had the features of typical “classic” SCLC, with small cells, scant ill-defined 
cytoplasm, finely granular nuclear chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli (Travis, 2012) 
(Figure 1H). The other population consisted of slightly larger cells with single, centrally 
located prominent nucleoli and well-defined eosinophilic cytoplasm, similar to what has 
been described as the variant form of SCLC (Gazdar et al., 1985) (Figure 1I). Individual 
tumors consisted of one of these forms or a mixture of both. A recent review on the 
pathology of murine neuroendocrine lung cancers failed to identify the variant form in these 
GEMMs (Gazdar et al., 2015). Of interest, LCNEC or NSCLC tumor components were not 
noted in RPM animals, although they have been described in other GEMMs (Gazdar et al., 
2015).
Because human SCLC is highly proliferative and apoptotic (Travis, 2012), we examined cell 
proliferation and apoptosis in RPM tumors at 6–8 weeks post-infection. RPM tumors had 
significantly higher levels of proliferation as measured by phospho-histone H3 (pHH3) 
levels compared to RP, Rb1fl/flTrp53fl/flRbl2fl/fl (RPR2) and RPP tumors (Figures 1J and 
1K). RPM tumors exhibited areas of cell death, but we did not observe the Azzopardi 
phenomenon as noted in other GEMMs (Gazdar et al., 2015). RPM tumors exhibited 
significantly more apoptotic cells than other SCLC models as measured by 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) for cleaved caspase-3 (CC3) (Figures 1J and 1L). Compared 
to homozygous RPM tumors, RPMLSL/+ tumors displayed subtly reduced levels of MYC 
(Figures S1G and S1H) but did not have statistically different levels of pHH3 or CC3 
(Figures S1I and S1J). RPM tumors were uniformly negative for alveolar (i.e. SFTPC/SPC) 
and club cell (i.e. SCGB1A1/CCSP) markers (Figures S1K-S1M). NKX2-1, also known as 
TTF1, is expressed in the vast majority of adenocarcinomas and SCLCs and RPM, RPP and 
LSL-KrasG12D/+;p53fl/fl (KP) tumors expressed nuclear NKX2-1 as expected (Figures S1K 
and S1N). These data demonstrate that MYC dramatically accelerates tumor formation 
predominantly exhibiting variant histopathology.
MYC promotes neuroendocrine-low SCLC with NEUROD1 expression
Neuroendocrine differentiation is considered a hallmark of classic SCLC. Previous GEMMs 
recapitulate the classic phenotype and are frequently associated with Mycl-amplifications 
(Calbo et al., 2011). In contrast, variant SCLC was previously reported to express low levels 
of neuroendocrine markers (Carney et al., 1985). Interestingly, RPM tumors recapitulate 
variant SCLC morphology and lack Mycl amplifications (Figure S2A). RPM tumors 
expressed significantly less Mycl and more Myc than tumors from RPP and RPR2 models 
(Figure S2B).

 To determine whether Myc is associated with attenuation of neuroendocrine differentiation 
in vivo, we performed hierarchical clustering analyses of neuroendocrine markers that 
overlapped between published microarray data derived from RP (n = 10) and RPR2 tumors 
(n = 3) (Schaffer et al., 2010), as well as RNA-seq data that we generated for additional 
RPR2 (n = 4) and RPM tumors (n = 11) (Figure 2A and Table S1). RPM tumors clustered 
independently from RP and RPR2 tumors and exhibited lower expression of the majority of 
neuroendocrine genes. Interestingly, RPM tumors had significantly reduced expression of 
the neurogenic transcription factor Ascl1 but high expression of Neurod1 (Figure 2B). 
Previous studies described distinct tumorigenic functions of ASCL1 and NEUROD1 in 
SCLC (Borromeo et al., 2016; Poirier et al., 2013; Poirier et al., 2015), and we sought to 
further explore the association between high Myc expression and neuroendocrine 
differentiation in our model. First, we analyzed our mouse tumor RNA-seq data using Gene 
Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). We found that an ASCL1high signature derived from gene 
expression profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq in human SCLC 
(Borromeo et al., 2016) was significantly depleted and a NEUROD1high signature was 
significantly enriched in RPM compared to RPR2 tumors (Figure 2C). Next, we examined 
protein expression of ASCL1 and NEUROD1 in multiple GEMMs by IHC. All SCLC 
models harbored ASCL1+ lung tumors, but the levels of ASCL1 were significantly lower in 
RPM tumors compared to RP, RPR2 and RPP models (Figure 2D). In contrast, RPM tumors 
demonstrated high and heterogeneous expression of NEUROD1 compared to classic 
GEMMs, which was only rarely detected in RPP tumors (Figure 2D). Compared to 
homozygous RPM tumors, RPMLSL/+ tumors had a trend towards higher ASCL1 and lower 
NEUROD1 expression but this was not statistically significant (Figure S2C). We also 
validated that RPM tumors express NEUROD1 by immunoblot using two independent 
antibodies, including the antibody used for IHC (Figure 2E). Together this suggests that 
MYC promotes a variant, neuroendocrine-low, NEUROD1+ subset of SCLC.
RPM tumors recapitulate molecular subset of MYC high human SCLC
Next, we asked whether a connection between MYC expression and these two key regulators 
of neuroendocrine signaling is recapitulated in human SCLC (Borromeo et al., 2016; Poirier 
et al., 2013). We collected publicly available transcriptome sequencing data of 81 SCLC 
specimens (George et al., 2015) and 20 SCLC cell lines (Peifer et al., 2012; Rudin et al., 
2012) and performed RNA-seq analysis on 14 additional SCLC cell lines. Hierarchical 
clustering analysis based on a predefined set of neuroendocrine markers (Table S1) led to 
robust separation of samples into groups with either low (group a) or high (groups b and c) 
MYC expression (Figure 3A). We observed distinct expression patterns of NEUROD1 and 
ASCL1 in these three groups, which distinguish classic and variant SCLC histology in cell 
lines and patient derived xenograft (PDX) models (Poirier et al., 2013; Poirier et al., 2015). 
Similar to RP and RPP tumors with low Myc expression (Figure 2B), we observed high 
expression of ASCL1 in group a, but low expression of ASCL1 in groups b and c that were 
enriched with samples expressing high MYC levels (Figure 3B). In contrast, high 
NEUROD1 expression was primarily present in group c enriched for high MYC expressing 
samples (Figure 3A), resembling the expression profile of RPM tumors (Figure 2B). 
Moreover, GSEA of human patient samples stratified by MYC expression showed a 
significant enrichment of the ASCL1high signature in MYC low samples and enrichment of 
Mollaoglu et al.

 the NEUROD1high signature in MYC high samples (Figure 3C). We observed a very similar 
clustering pattern of samples with high MYC expression in a recently published collection 
of 65 SCLC cell lines (25 shared with our cell lines) that were analyzed using gene 
expression arrays (Figures S3A and S3B)(Polley et al., 2016). Thus, our data show that in 
RPM mouse tumors, MYC is associated with differential expression of Ascl1 and Neurod1 
and that these expression profiles are highly conserved in human SCLC.
Given the greater variability of ASCL1 and NEUROD1 expression in human tumors 
compared to murine tumors by RNA-seq analysis, we went back to the RPM mouse model 
and examined the expression of ASCL1 and NEUROD1 at early (in situ) and late (invasive) 
time points. We found that in situ lesions from RPM animals 1–4 weeks post-infection were 
predominantly classic morphology with high ASCL1 expression (Figure 3D). Of 26 in situ 
lesions examined, 23 (88%) were clearly ASCL1+ while none were NEUROD1+. In 
contrast, 44% of large invasive lesions at 6–8 post-infection (18 of 41) exhibited variant 
morphology with NEUROD1 expression and either some or no ASCL1 expression. In 
addition, 17% of invasive tumors were low or negative for both ASCL1 and NEUROD1 
(Figure 3D), similar to the subset of human tumors (group b) with the highest levels of MYC 
(Figure 3B). Some invasive tumors exhibited high levels of both ASCL1 and NEUROD1, 
although whether cells are intermixed or co-expressing both proteins cannot be determined 
by this method. RPM tumors also expressed other neuroendocrine markers including CGRP 
and Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule 1 (NCAM1), which was evident in classic lesions and 
reduced in the majority of variant tumors, similar to ASCL1 expression (Figure S3C). Of 
note, RPM tumors exhibited robust staining for UCHL1 (also called PGP9.5) (Figure S3D), 
which was consistently expressed across murine and human SCLC tumors and cell lines 
irrespective of MYC status (Figures 2A and 3A). Overexpression of MYC in an RP cell line 
led to repression of Synaptophysin (SYP) (Figure S3E), while knockdown of MYC in MYC-
amplified SCLC cell lines led to an increase in SYP mRNA and protein (Figures S3F and 
S3G), suggesting that MYC may indeed be involved in the modulation of neuroendocrine 
differentiation. While MYC has been described as a target gene of NEUROD1 (Borromeo et 
al., 2016), we did not identify Neurod1 as a MYC target gene in RPM cell lines analyzed by 
ChIP-seq (Figure S3H). Given that MYC is expressed in in situ lesions in the absence of 
NEUROD1 expression (Figure 3D), this suggests MYC’s role in NEUROD1 regulation is 
likely through indirect mechanisms. Together, this indicates that high MYC expression 
during tumor progression modulates the neuroendocrine phenotype of SCLC and can lead to 
advanced lesions with heterogeneous patterns of neuroendocrine differentiation.
MYC-driven tumors are highly metastatic similar to the human disease
To assess whether MYC-driven tumorigenesis was associated with metastases, we collected 
liver and lymph nodes from tumor-bearing RPM mice at 8 weeks and RPP mice at 24 weeks 
to control for the amount of primary tumor burden in each genotype. Mediastinal spread via 
lymphatics and blood borne metastases in the liver were prominent in RPM mice (Figures 
4A and 4B). Out of 16 livers from RPM mice, 14 (~88%) exhibited liver metastases, often 
presenting with multiple micro-metastases (Figures 4A and 4C). Remarkably, clusters of 
tumor cells were identified in the blood vessels of the liver, and were proliferating as 
evidenced by multiple mitotic cells (Figure 4A). Despite the much longer time frame for

 tumor development, significantly fewer RPP animals demonstrated liver metastases (36%) 
(Figure 4C). Fifteen out of 21 RPM mice (~71%) also exhibited metastases to mediastinal 
and distant lymph nodes (Figure 4B and data not shown). Metastases were highly 
proliferative based on Ki67 staining and stained strongly for NKX2-1 and UCHL1 (Figure 
4D), consistent with a lung neuroendocrine origin. RPM tumors also exhibited high levels of 
the metastatic driver NFIB in both primary tumors and metastases (Figures 4D and 4E), but 
did not exhibit Nfib amplifications that are commonly found in MYCL-driven SCLC (Figure 
S2A)(Denny et al., 2016; Dooley et al., 2011; Semenova et al., 2016). However, consistent 
with high homogeneous NFIB expression in primary tumors (Figure 4E), Nfib was identified 
as a MYC target gene by ChIP-seq in RPM cell lines (Figure 4F). This suggests that MYC 
directly regulates Nfib, which may contribute to rapid metastases. Thus the metastatic 
pattern of MYC-driven mouse SCLC resembles human SCLC and occurs much more 
rapidly than in other classic GEMMs (McFadden et al., 2014; Meuwissen et al., 2003; 
Schaffer et al., 2010).
MYC-driven SCLC is responsive to chemotherapy but rapidly relapses
The influence of MYC on chemotherapy response in SCLC is controversial and has not been 
explored in vivo to our knowledge (Hodgkinson et al., 2014; Johnson et al., 1987). To 
address this, we treated RPM and RPP mice with or without a single dose of 7 mg/kg 
cisplatin (day 1) and 10 mg/kg etoposide (day 2) followed by a single 24 hr pulse of BrdU, 
and collected lung tissue for IHC analyses. Untreated tumors of both genotypes exhibited 
detectable DNA damage measured by levels of phospho-histone H2A.X (pH2AX) (Figure 
5A). In response to chemotherapy, RPM and RPP tumors exhibited a significant increase in 
pH2AX as expected (Figures 5A and 5B). In contrast to adenocarcinomas that exhibit a 
strong cell cycle arrest following chemotherapy (Oliver et al., 2010), neither RPM nor RPP 
tumors exhibited reduced proliferation (Figures 5A and 5C). Instead, chemotherapy-treated 
RPM tumors had significantly increased levels of CC3 compared to untreated controls, 
which was not observed in RPP tumors (Figures 5A and 5D). Together, this suggests that 
high levels of DNA damage coupled with a failure to arrest the cell cycle leads to apoptotic 
cell death in RPM tumors.
Because of the dramatic response to a single dose of chemotherapy, we sought to determine 
whether chemotherapy could reduce tumor burden in RPM animals. We treated a cohort of 
RPM mice with two doses of combination chemotherapy (5 mg/kg cisplatin and 10 mg/kg 
etoposide) or vehicle control and harvested lung tissue 72 hr after the second dose. RPM 
tumors treated with chemotherapy exhibited dramatically reduced tumor burden (3.8 
± 1.6%) compared to control animals (19.5 ± 3.1% tumor burden) (Figures 5E and S4), 
indicating that MYC-driven tumors are indeed chemo-sensitive. MicroCT imaging provides 
a more comprehensive assessment of tumor burden, so we also quantified tumor burden 
before treatment (d0) and again on day 12 (d12) following two doses of chemotherapy. PBS-
treated tumors grew significantly from 12% to 35% tumor burden in only 12 days, whereas 
chemotherapy-treated tumors had minor increases from 12% to 17% tumor burden that were 
not statistically significant (Figure 5F). We observed heterogeneity in the response of 
individual tumors including progression, stasis and regression (data not shown). In another 
cohort of RPM mice, combination chemotherapy significantly prolonged survival, but the

 overall added survival benefit was only 10.5 days (Figure 5G). The majority of lungs from 
RPM mice receiving repeated chemotherapy still harbored tumors (Figure S4), suggesting 
that they had possibly acquired resistance to chemotherapy. These data suggest that RPM 
tumors accurately reflect the clinical response of human SCLC. While MYC alone does not 
confer chemo-resistance per se, MYC-driven tumors rapidly relapse following treatment. 
This prompted us to search for targeted therapies that could improve chemotherapy 
response.
MYC-driven SCLC is vulnerable to Aurora kinase inhibition
Despite numerous efforts, MYC remains difficult to target with small molecules. However, a 
number of synthetic lethal targets have been identified in MYC-driven tumors that may 
provide therapeutically exploitable vulnerabilities (Brockmann et al., 2013; Bunn et al., 
2016; Sos et al., 2012; Toyoshima et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2010). To assess the efficacy of 
drugs that inhibit such candidate synthetic lethal targets, we profiled the activity of 
etoposide, cisplatin, PF-670462 (CKIε inhibitor), MS436 (BRD4 inhibitor), Alisertib 
(Aurora A inhibitor), Barasertib (Aurora B inhibitor) and Milciclib (CDK2 inhibitor) across 
17 human SCLC cell lines (Figure 6A). MYC-amplified SCLCs were significantly more 
responsive to etoposide (adjusted p = 0.038), Alisertib (p = 0.001) and Barasertib (p = 0.022) 
compared to those with MYCL or MYCN amplifications (Figure 6B). We also analyzed a 
recently published drug screen including 68 human SCLC cell lines by binning cells based 
on high or low MYC expression (Polley et al., 2016). Again, Alisertib, Barasertib and 
multiple other Aurora kinase inhibitors exhibited increased efficacy in MYC high cell lines 
(Figure S5A). Next, we generated mouse cell lines from RPM tumors including five from 
RPM mice and two from RPMLSL/+ mice. Cells grew largely in suspension, often in loose 
aggregates or clusters similar to human variant SCLC cell lines (Figure S5B). RPM cell 
lines expressed high levels of MYC and did not express RB1 or TRP53 (Figure S5C). Next, 
we treated RPM, RPMLSL/+, RPP, RP and KP cell lines with cisplatin, etoposide, Alisertib 
or Barasertib. RPM cells exhibited high micromolar GI50 in response to cisplatin, but were 
highly sensitive to etoposide at nanomolar concentrations (Figures 6C and 6D). RPM cells 
were particularly sensitive to Alisertib and Barasertib when compared to adenocarcinoma 
cell lines and non-MYC-driven cells (Figures 6E–6G). RPM cells tended to have a shorter 
doubling time, but there was not a significant correlation between doubling time and 
Alisertib sensitivity (Figure S5D). Alisertib treatment resulted in dose-dependent inhibition 
of AURKA and AURKB at concentrations in the range of the determined GI50 value in 
mouse and human cells, while Barasertib was highly specific for AURKB (Figures 6H, S5E 
and S5F). In MYC-amplified GLC2 cells we observed a reduction in viability after 
knockdown of AURKA and of AURKB implying that inhibition of AURKB could also play 
a role in the reduced viability of Alisertib-treated cells (Figure S5G). In RPM cells, Alisertib 
caused a dose-dependent increase in G2/M phase cells followed by an increase in subG1 
cells, suggesting that cells fail to properly exit mitosis and die thereafter (Figure 6I). 
Compared to KP, RPP and RP cells, RPM cells exhibited a greater increase in subG1 cells 
following Alisertib treatment (Figure 6I). In contrast to described mechanisms of Aurora 
kinase inhibition in other malignancies (Brockmann et al., 2013; Otto et al., 2009), Alisertib 
treatment did not primarily lead to reduced MYC protein in mouse or human cells (Figures 
6H, S5E and S5F) even after cycloheximide-induced block of protein synthesis (Figure

 S5H). As expected, MYC was more stable in mouse cells expressing MYCT58A (PB115), 
when compared to MYCWT cells (GLC1) (Figure S5H). However, in both cell lines, we did 
not observe a robust decrease of MYC after Alisertib treatment compared to control cells, 
suggesting that MYCT58A likely does not alter the mechanistic basis of Alisertib sensitivity 
(Figure S5H). While the effect of Alisertib treatment was pronounced in vitro, the 
combination of Alisertib with etoposide, but not cisplatin, further decreased cell viability in 
MYC-amplified cells (Figure S5I). This suggests that MYC-driven SCLC is highly sensitive 
to Aurora kinase inhibition in mouse and human cells independent of proliferation rate and 
its impact on MYC levels.
Aurora kinase inhibition significantly improves chemotherapy response of MYC- driven 
SCLC
To determine the efficacy of Alisertib in vivo, RPM mice were imaged by microCT and 
upon detection of tumors, randomly assigned to receive either vehicle control (PBS), 
chemotherapy (cisplatin and etoposide), Alisertib, or chemotherapy plus Alisertib (Figure 
7A). Mice were imaged immediately before treatment and four days after each cisplatin 
treatment for up to 20 days. Weight loss upon Alisertib treatment did not differ from PBS-
treated animals but regimens with chemotherapy caused ~15–20% weight loss such that one 
animal in each treatment group required sacrifice due to toxicity (Figure S6A). We 
quantified total tumor volume relative to total air volume as a comprehensive measurement 
of treatment impact. PBS-treated animals exhibited rapid tumor growth within 12 days 
following tumor detection (Figures 7B, 7C and S6B). Alisertib-treated animals exhibited a 
modest delay in tumor growth, which was largely attributable to its impact at early time 
points. The majority of chemotherapy-treated animals completed three cycles of therapy 
with significantly delayed tumor growth (Figures 7B, 7C and S6B). Strikingly, the majority 
of animals treated with a combination of Alisertib and chemotherapy exhibited complete 
tumor stasis over three cycles of treatment (Figures 7B, 7C and S6B). We analyzed the 
percent change in total tumor volume at day 19 (or at the time of death if sooner) compared 
to day 0 in each treatment group by waterfall plot. Despite the initial delay in tumor growth, 
Alisertib alone did not impact overall response compared to untreated animals in this time 
frame (Figure 7D). Of chemotherapy-treated animals, 5 of 14 experienced stable disease 
while the majority of animals (n = 9 of 14) progressed during treatment. Remarkably, the 
majority of animals treated with chemotherapy and Alisertib (n = 10 of 16) exhibited stable 
disease including three animals with >30% reduction in tumor volume (Figure 7D).
Given the heterogeneity in classic and variant cells in the RPM model, we sought to 
determine whether these treatments impact ASCL1, NEUROD1 or MYC levels. 
Interestingly, chemotherapy led to a reduction in ASCL1 levels, suggesting that the classic 
or early stage lesions may be more chemo-sensitive in this model (Figures 7E and 7F). Most 
strikingly, Alisertib treatment led to a dramatic enrichment of cells with polyploidy and 
aberrant mitoses (Figure S6C) consistent with its mechanism of action (Wilkinson et al., 
2007). These abnormal cells were NEUROD1+ and significantly enriched in Alisertib-
treated animals compared to other treatment groups (Figures 7E, 7F and S6C). The 
combination of Alisertib with chemotherapy, however, did not lead to enrichment of 
NEUROD1+ cells, suggesting that chemotherapy may have contributed to the depletion of

 these large aberrant cells. MYC levels were not significantly altered in any treatment group 
compared to untreated tumors (Figure 7F).
Despite the modest delay in tumor growth, Alisertib treatment increased median survival by 
10 days compared to untreated animals, comparable to chemotherapy, which increased 
survival by 11 days (Figure 7G). The combination of chemotherapy with Alisertib increased 
median survival by 14 days compared to untreated mice and was significantly more 
efficacious than either Alisertib or chemotherapy alone. Importantly, 47% of combination-
treated mice survived 30 days compared to 0%, 5%, and 8% of the PBS, chemo- or 
Alisertib-treated animals (Fisher's exact test p = 0.0008, 0.0032, and 0.0433, respectively). 
These results suggest that Alisertib with chemotherapy in first-line treatment of MYC-driven 
SCLC halts tumor growth and significantly extends survival compared to the standard-of-
care chemotherapy.
DISCUSSSION
Over 30 years ago, human SCLC cell lines with variant morphology were found to exhibit 
frequent MYC amplifications (Carney et al., 1985; Gazdar et al., 1985). Here we show that 
MYC drives the variant histopathology in vivo, a subset of tumors that has not been 
previously observed in GEMMs (Gazdar et al., 2015). Our data suggest this is likely because 
Mycl is the oncogenic driver in other GEMMs (Calbo et al., 2011; Dooley et al., 2011), 
whereas Myc serves this function in our model. Importantly, we find that MYC promotes a 
neuroendocrine-low phenotype associated with high expression of NEUROD1. NEUROD1 
expression was initially found to correlate with the variant subtype of cell lines (Poirier et 
al., 2013) and was subsequently found to stratify a subset of ASCL1low primary human 
SCLCs in multiple studies (Borromeo et al., 2016; Poirier et al., 2015). NEUROD1 is 
present along with MYC at super-enhancers in MYC high cell lines (Borromeo et al., 2016; 
Christensen et al., 2014). Thus far, it appears that normal mouse neuroendocrine cells do not 
express Neurod1, so it has been questioned whether NEUROD1-expressing human tumors 
arise in the lung or metastasize from elsewhere in the body (Borromeo et al., 2016; Bunn et 
al., 2016). We show that murine MYC-driven SCLCs express NEUROD1 and have a 
significantly higher NEUROD1 signature than other GEMMs, suggesting that their human 
counterparts arise in the lung. Based on in situ immunostaining patterns for ASCL1 and 
NEUROD1, we postulate that MYC-driven tumor cells arise in ASCL1+ precursors, and 
these early tumor cells initially exhibit classic morphology. With time, it appears that tumors 
switch to an ASCL1low/NEUROD1high state coincident with the appearance of variant 
morphology and neuroendocrine-low phenotype. Since overexpression of NEUROD1 has 
been linked to the development of metastases and aggressive SCLC (Osborne et al., 2013), 
our data suggest that MYC activation could fuel this phenotype via NEUROD1 signaling. 
Our data suggest MYC’s role in NEUROD1 regulation may be indirect given the absence of 
NEUROD1 expression in in situ lesions that are MYC+. Given the essential role of ASCL1 
in MYCL-driven tumors (Borromeo et al., 2016), further studies are warranted to address the 
role of ASCL1 and NEUROD1 in MYC-driven tumors. These data have important clinical 
implications given the recent development of neuroendocrine gene targeted therapies such as 
the DLL3-antibody drug conjugate (Saunders et al., 2015). Our data predict that MYC-

 driven SCLCs with low neuroendocrine gene expression may be relatively less responsive to 
some neuroendocrine-targeted therapies.
There is an urgent need for SCLC models that recapitulate the key clinical aspects of the 
human disease. The short latency of SCLC development in RPM mice will greatly facilitate 
preclinical therapeutic studies in SCLC. MYC-driven SCLCs also rapidly develop 
metastases to the lymph nodes and liver with frequencies similar to the human disease, and 
in manageable time frames for studying mechanisms of metastasis including the role of 
NFIB. Because the RPM mice are immunocompetent, they will complement other 
immunodeficient SCLC models such as PDXs derived from tissue or circulating tumor cells 
(Hodgkinson et al., 2014).
One of the major clinical barriers to SCLC treatment is the development of chemotherapy 
resistance. Like human SCLC, RPM tumors demonstrate acute sensitivity to chemotherapy, 
suggesting that MYC alone is not sufficient to promote chemo-resistance. However, it is not 
yet clear whether ASCL1+ or NEUROD1+ components have differential sensitivities to 
chemotherapy so further studies to address the heterogeneity in treatment response of MYC-
driven tumors is warranted. Our findings suggest that MYC’s role in tumor progression is to 
promote aggressive proliferation and metastases, but its role in chemo-resistance requires 
further investigation. The RPM GEMM will serve as a useful tool for uncovering 
mechanisms of chemo-resistance and for testing therapeutic strategies to combat chemo-
resistant disease.
MYC-driven tumors, including SCLCs, exhibit synthetic lethality with Aurora kinase 
inhibition, but this had not been explored in SCLC GEMMs in vivo (Brockmann et al., 2013; 
Gustafson et al., 2014; Hook et al., 2012; Otto et al., 2009; Sos et al., 2012; Yang et al., 
2010). Our data suggest that MYC sensitizes SCLC to Aurora kinase inhibition particularly 
in combination with chemotherapy, which significantly improved tumor control and 
prolonged survival compared to chemotherapy alone. Alisertib monotherapy had only 
modest impact in vivo, but it remains possible that an optimized dosing regimen could 
improve this response. Recent clinical trials in relapsed SCLC tested Alisertib monotherapy 
with ~20% of patients exhibiting partial responses (Melichar et al., 2015) while a pan-
Aurora kinase inhibitor had no responses in a small number of relapsed patients (Schoffski 
et al., 2015). Current clinical trials are assessing Alisertib in combination with chemotherapy 
as a second-line therapy (NCT02038647). Our data predict that MYC levels, a 
neuroendocrine-low expression profile, or variant histopathology may serve as biomarkers 
for sensitivity to Aurora kinase inhibition in patients. Finally, our data suggest that Aurora 
kinase inhibition can improve chemotherapy response in vivo, suggesting that patients with 
MYC-amplified SCLCs may benefit from first-line Aurora kinase inhibitors in combination 
with standard chemotherapy. Together these findings challenge the current classification of 
SCLC as a homogeneous disease and suggest that distinct subtypes of SCLC exist with 
specific vulnerabilities to targeted therapies that are poised to improve patient outcomes.

 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Mice
Mice were housed in an environmentally controlled room and all experiments were 
performed in accordance with University of Utah’s Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee. p53fl/fl mice were generated by A. Berns (Meuwissen et al., 2003) and RP mice 
were provided by T. Jacks (Sage et al., 2003). RPP mice were provided by D. MacPherson 
(Cui et al., 2014). RPM mice will be available at The Jackson Laboratory as stock no. 
029971. At 6–8 weeks of age, anesthetized mice were infected with 106 - 108 PFU of Ad5-
Cgrp-Cre viruses (University of Iowa) by intratracheal instillation as described elsewhere 
(Jackson et al., 2001). Viruses were administered in a Biosafety Level 2+ room according to 
Institutional Biosafety Committee guidelines. Both male and female mice were equally 
divided between treatment groups for all experiments.
MicroCT and Bioluminescent Imaging
Mice were scanned for 34 s under isoflurane anesthesia using a small animal Quantum FX 
microCT (PerkinElmer) at 45 μm resolution, 90 kV with 160 μA current. Images were 
acquired using PerkinElmer Quantum FX software and processed with Analyze 11.0 
(AnalyzeDirect). For bioluminescent imaging, mice were shaved and given 150 mg/kg D-
luciferin potassium salt (Regis Technologies) intraperitoneally and imaged on a Xenogen 
IVIS Spectrum instrument (PerkinElmer).
Immunohistochemistry
Lungs were inflated with PBS or formalin, fixed overnight in neutral buffered formalin, and 
transferred to 70% ethanol. Paraffin embedded lung lobes were sectioned at 4 μm and 
stained with H&E for tumor pathology or with antibodies as described previously 
(Mukhopadhyay et al., 2014).
Human genomics
RNA-seq data for human patient samples and cell lines were obtained from published 
literature (George et al., 2015; Peifer et al., 2012; Rudin et al., 2012) and newly generated 
datasets with gene expression quantified as fragments per kilobase per million reads 
(FPKM) and analyses performed on log2(FPKM+1).
Statistics
Boxplots represent 25th and 75th percentiles with midline indicating the median; whiskers 
extend to the lowest/highest value within 1.5 times the interquartile range. Outliers are 
shown as dots.

 SIGNIFICANCE
SCLC has historically been treated therapeutically as a homogeneous disease without 
molecular stratification. SCLC has a dismal prognosis with no targeted therapies 
approved for treatment. Tumors uniformly lack RB1 and TP53 and frequently acquire 
genomic amplifications of a MYC family member including MYC, MYCL or MYCN. 
We developed a MYC-driven GEMM that recapitulates key features of human SCLC. 
Surprisingly, this model mimics a human SCLC subtype characterized by “variant” 
morphology, high NEUROD1 and low expression of neuroendocrine genes including 
ASCL1. Targeted drug screening revealed that MYC-driven SCLC is uniquely sensitive 
to Aurora kinase inhibitors, which dramatically improves chemotherapy response in vivo. 
Aurora kinase inhibition with first-line chemotherapy is a potential therapeutic approach 
for MYC-driven SCLC.

 Highlights
•
MYC dramatically accelerates tumorigenesis and metastases in Rb1/Trp53 
null SCLC
•
MYC promotes a NEUROD1+, neuroendocrine-low subtype with variant 
histopathology
•
MYC-driven SCLCs are chemo-sensitive but rapidly relapse
•
MYC sensitizes SCLC to combined Aurora kinase inhibition and 
chemotherapy treatment
