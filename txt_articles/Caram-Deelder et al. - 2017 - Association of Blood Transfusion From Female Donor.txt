IMPORTANCE Transfusion of red blood cells from female donors has been associated with
increased mortality in male recipients.
OBJECTIVE To quantify the association between red blood cell transfusion from female
donors with and without a history of pregnancy and mortality of red blood cell recipients.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study of first-time transfusion
recipients at 6 major Dutch hospitals enrolled from May 30, 2005, to September 1, 2015; the
final follow-up date was September 1, 2015. The primary analysis was the no-donor-mixture
cohort (ie, either all red blood cell transfusions exclusively from male donors, or all exclusively
from female donors without a history of pregnancy, or all exclusively from female donors with
a history of pregnancy). The association between mortality and exposure to transfusions
from ever-pregnant or never-pregnant female donors was analyzed using life tables and
time-varying Cox proportional hazards models.
EXPOSURES Red blood cell transfusions from ever-pregnant or never-pregnant female
donors, compared with red blood cell transfusions from male donors.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES All-cause mortality during follow-up.
RESULTS The cohort for the primary analyses consisted of 31 118 patients (median age, 65
[interquartile range, 42-77] years; 52% female) who received 59 320 red blood cell
transfusions exclusively from 1 of 3 types of donors (88% male; 6% ever-pregnant female;
and 6% never-pregnant female). The number of deaths in this cohort was 3969 (13%
mortality). For male recipients of red blood cell transfusions, all-cause mortality rates after a
red blood cell transfusion from an ever-pregnant female donor vs male donor were 101 vs 80
deaths per 1000 person-years (time-dependent “per transfusion”hazard ratio [HR] for death,
1.13 [95% CI, 1.01-1.26]). For receipt of transfusion from a never-pregnant female donor vs
male donor, mortality rates were 78 vs 80 deaths per 1000 person-years (HR, 0.93 [95% CI,
0.81-1.06]). Among female recipients of red blood cell transfusions, mortality rates for an
ever-pregnant female donor vs male donor were 74 vs 62 per 1000 person-years (HR, 0.99
[95% CI, 0.87 to 1.13]); for a never-pregnant female donor vs male donor, mortality rates were
74 vs 62 per 1000 person-years (HR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.88-1.15]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients who received red blood cell transfusions,
receipt of a transfusion from an ever-pregnant female donor, compared with a male donor,
was associated with increased all-cause mortality among male recipients but not among
female recipients. Transfusions from never-pregnant female donors were not associated with
increased mortality among male or female recipients. Further research is needed to replicate
these findings, determine their clinical significance, and identify the underlying mechanism.

 T
ransfusion of red blood cells is among the most com-
monly performed procedures in hospitals.1 It has been
reported that mortality was increased after transfu-
sion of red blood cells from female donors compared with
male donors.2-7 The most common cause of transfusion-
related mortality is transfusion-related acute lung injury
(TRALI), which has also been shown to be associated with
transfusions from female donors.8-10 Furthermore, TRALI is
associated specifically with transfusions from female donors
with a history of pregnancy.11,12 This raises the question
whether the increased mortality after red blood cell transfu-
sions could also depend on a history of pregnancy of the
donor. However, for TRALI it has been shown that only
plasma-rich products confer a pregnancy-related antibody–
mediated risk, whereas red blood cells do not.10,11 The
increased mortality in recipients of red blood cells from
female donors may be related to either immunologic phe-
nomena or other mechanisms.
Any proposed immunologic mechanism is likely to be
dependent on a history of pregnancy of the donor. An
absence of association with pregnancy status of the donor
would suggest that other, nonimmunologic, mechanisms are
more likely.
The aim of the current study was therefore to quantify the
association between red blood cell transfusion from female
blood donors, with and without a history of pregnancy, and
patient mortality in female and male transfusion recipients.
Methods
Study Design
As previously described, a retrospective cohort of first-ever
transfusion recipients, transfused from May 30, 2005, to
September 1, 2015, in 6 major Dutch hospitals, was
established.13,14 All patients included in a previous study of
mortality after transfusion of red blood cells from female
donors were excluded from the current analyses to create
an independent cohort.2
Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the in-
stitutional review board of the Leiden University Medical Cen-
ter and from local review boards of all participating centers.
The review boards waived the need for informed consent, be-
cause only routinely collected data were processed after cod-
ing to remove identifying information.
Population
Primary analyses were performed in a “no-donor-mixture”
cohort, to avoid dilution of effects from mixing patients
who received red blood cell transfusions from both male and
female donors. This cohort consisted of patients who
received all their red blood cell transfusions exclusively from
male donors, or all exclusively from female donors without
a history of pregnancy (never-pregnant donors), or all exclu-
sively from female donors with a history of pregnancy
(ever-pregnant donors). Follow-up time was censored at the
time these inclusion criteria were violated. This censoring
could occur at time 0, in which case recipients contributed
zero follow-up time and were not included in the denomina-
tor. Similarly, a “single-transfusion” cohort also was
selected, consisting of patients who received only a single
transfusion. Additionally, all analyses were repeated in the
full cohort, to check whether any observed association
potentially depended on the selection of the no-donor-
mixture cohort. The race/ethnicity of recipients and donors
was not recorded.
Recorded Data
Recipent Data
Information on transfusion recipients’dates of birth, dates of
death, and sex, as well as transfusion dates, product types,
and identification codes of transfused red blood cells, were
provided by the hospitals from electronic records of the
blood transfusion services. All transfusions, given for any
indication, were included. Mortality data were verified by the
hospitals until the date of data extraction. Mortality data
were considered complete because of the use of a nationally
linked computer system and the legal requirement for report-
ing all deaths to this system. The final follow-up date was
September 1, 2015.
Donor and Blood Product Data
Information on donor dates of birth, sex, and pregnancy be-
fore donation (see the Supplement for details) were provided
by Sanquin (the national Dutch blood supply) and linked to re-
cipients’data using the product identification codes of trans-
fused red blood cells. All blood products in the Netherlands
are leukocyte-depleted by prestorage filtration, and nearly all
products are transfused ABO-RhD identically.
Pregnancy of Female Blood Donors
At their first donation, female blood donors self-reported
any previous pregnancy. At all subsequent donations, they
reported whether they had been pregnant since the previ-
ous donation. However, since some female donors had their
first-ever donation prior to the establishment of the current
electronic recording system at the Sanquin blood bank, the
answer to the question at first donation could be missing.
Key Points
Question Is there an association between red blood cell
transfusion from female donors with and without a history of
pregnancy and recipient mortality?
Findings In this cohort study that included 31 118 patients who
received red blood cell transfusions, receipt of a transfusion from
an ever-pregnant female donor was associated with a statistically
significant increase in all-cause mortality among male recipients of
red blood cell transfusions (hazard ratio, 1.13) but not among
female recipients (hazard ratio, 0.99).
Meaning Receipt of red blood cell transfusion from female donors
with a history of pregnancy was associated with increased
mortality among male recipients; further research is needed to
replicate these findings, determine their significance, and define
the underlying mechanism.

 When the first donation was registered and the question
answered as never-pregnant, the pregnancy status was con-
sidered never-pregnant until the first subsequent donation
at which a pregnancy was reported. If the first donation was
missing, the pregnancy status was considered unknown
until the first subsequent donation at which a pregnancy
was reported.
Missing Data
Information about donors’ pregnancy history was not
specifically recorded and was therefore missing for 44%
of donations from female donors (eTable 2 in the Supple-
ment). However, missingness depended solely on logistic
factors (ie, changes in the electronic recording of donor infor-
mation over the years). These data were therefore expected
to be “missing completely at random” (as also shown in
eTable 3 in the Supplement), allowing a valid “complete
case” analysis.15 We therefore selected only cases with com-
plete data available.
Statistical Analyses
All statistical analyses were performed in Stata version 14.1.16
The only outcome assessed was all-cause mortality at any time
during follow-up, as specified per participating center (eTable
1 in the Supplement).
Survival analyses were performed with follow-up
starting on the day of the first red blood cell transfusion.
Follow-up ended at death or on the reference day,
determined for each hospi-
tal separately (eTable 1 in
the Supplement). The refer-
ence day was the last day for
which the hospital had
provided data. Follow-up
time of recipients in the dif-
ferent cohorts was censored
at the time the inclusion cri-
teria for that cohort were
first violated. To increase
homogeneity, follow-up
t i m e o f p a t i e n t s w h o
received more than 15 trans-
fusions was censored at the
time of the 16th transfusion. All analyses were stratified by
recipients’sex. Transfusions of other blood products were
ignored, because receipt of these blood products was not
correlated with sex and pregnancy history of the donor of
red blood cells (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
All reported P values are 2-sided, and P < .05 was consid-
ered statistically significant. No adjustments for multiple com-
parisons were performed.
Kaplan-Meier Analyses
Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed for the single-
transfusion cohort. The analyses were limited to 3 years of
follow-up. At this time, differences in cumulative incidence
between different groups and 95% CIs for these differences
were calculated according to standard formulas (additional
details reported in the Supplement).
Time-Varying Cox Proportional Hazards Models
Cox proportional hazards models, including both time-
varyingandfixedvariables,werefittocorrectforpotentialcon-
founding. All confounding variables (ie, center [fixed], recipi-
ents’ABO-RhD blood group [fixed], age of the donor [time-
varying], cumulative number of transfusions [time-varying],
calendar year [time-varying], and an interaction term for cen-
ter and number of transfusions [time-varying]) were in-
cludedinthemodelsascategoricalvariables,withasmanycat-
egories as there were exposure levels (details on potential
confounders are reported in the Supplement).
For the time-varying analyses, values of variables could
change on each day with red blood cell transfusion. At each
day with red blood cell transfusion, the cumulative number
of red blood cell transfusions and of red blood cell transfu-
sions from male, female never-pregnant, and female
ever-pregnant donors, up to and including that day, were
determined.
Exposures (ie, cumulative number of transfusions from
never-pregnant or ever-pregnant female donors [time-
varying]) were included in the models as continuous vari-
ables. Consequently, hazard ratios (HRs) should be inter-
preted on a multiplicative scale. However, since the model
estimates the HR based on observed numbers of transfusions
only, the HRs should not be extrapolated beyond the ob-
servedmeannumberoftransfusionsineachcohort(seeeTable
3 in the Supplement for an illustration of this interpretation).
Theproportionalhazardsassumptionwascheckedforallmod-
els and no gross violations of this assumption were detected,
implying that the HR can be interpreted as a valid estimate of
the average HR over the observed period.
Separate models were run for the 2 different exposures
(ie, never-pregnant and ever-pregnant). For the no-donor-
mixture cohort, this meant exclusion of patients who
received any transfusions from the other exposure group,
any transfusions with unknown pregnancy history, or a mix-
ture of exposed (ie, ever-pregnant or never-pregnant,
depending on the analyses) and unexposed (ie, male) red
blood cell units. This way, the exposure group of interest
was always compared directly with male donors, since all
other units were excluded. For the full model, recipients of
transfusions both from the exposure group of interest and
from male donors were additionally included.
Effect Measure Modification
We previously reported effect measure modification by age
of the transfusion recipients.2 A primary objective of this
study therefore was to repeat these analyses after stratifica-
tion by age of the recipient for prespecified categories of age
(0-17, 18-50, 51-70, and ≥71 years). Effect-measure modifica-
tion was formally quantified by adding interaction terms for
age (P value for interaction trend across 4 categories, from
a Z distribution using standard errors estimated from the
observed information matrix) and sex of the recipient to
the final model.

 Results
Population
A total of 42 132 patients received 106 641 units of red blood
cells (76% from male donors, 12% from ever-pregnant
donors, 12% from never-pregnant female donors). The
median number of transfused units per recipient was 2 (inter-
quartile range [IQR], 2-3). These recipients were followed up
for a median of 380 days (IQR, 27-1217), had a median age of
66 years (IQR, 46-77), and 21 915 (52%) were female. The
number of deaths was 6975 (17%). Among this full cohort,
31 118 patients received 59 320 units of red blood cells exclu-
sively from 1 of the 3 types of donor (ie, the no-donor-
mixture cohort: either all units exclusively from male donors,
exclusively from female donors without a history of preg-
nancy [never-pregnant donors], or exclusively from female
donors with a history of pregnancy [ever-pregnant donors]).
These recipients were followed up for a median of 245 days
(IQR, 9-1172) and had a median age of 65 years (IQR, 42-77);
16 123 (52%) were female. The number of deaths in the
no-donor-mixture cohort was 3969 (13%). Table 1 shows a
comparison of recipient characteristics between the
no-donor-mixture cohort, single-transfusion cohort, and full
cohort, stratified by recipient sex.

Cell Transfusions
Primary Analyses: No-Donor-Mixture Cohort
The HR for death after 1 additional unit of red blood cells from
a never-pregnant female donor, compared with a unit from a
male donor, was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.81 to 1.06) for male recipi-
ents and 1.01 (95% CI, 0.88 to 1.15) for female recipients
(Table 2).

cipients and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.87 to 1.13) for female recipients
(Table 2).
The highest HRs for death after transfusion of red blood
cells from ever-pregnant female donors were observed in
male recipients 50 years and younger (Table 3).
Secondary Analyses 1: Single-Transfusion Cohort
The 3 years cumulative incidence of death among male recipi-
ents was 13.5% after a transfusion from a male donor, 13.1%
after a transfusion from a never-pregnant female donor (dif-
ference,0.4%[95%CI,−3.8%to3.0%]),and16.9%afteratrans-
fusion from an ever-pregnant female donor (difference, 3.5%
[95% CI, −0.3% to 7.2%]) (Figure).
The cumulative incidence of death among female recipi-
ents was 12.6% after a transfusion from a male donor, 12.0%
after a transfusion from a never-pregnant female donor (dif-
ference,0.6%[95%CI,−3.7%to2.6%]),and15.9%afteratrans-
fusion from an ever-pregnant female donor (difference, 3.3%
[95% CI, −0.5% to 7.1%]) (Figure).
Secondary Analyses 2: Full Cohort
The HR for death after 1 additional unit of red blood cells from
an ever-pregnant female donor, compared with a male do-
nor, was 1.08 (95% CI, 1.02 to 1.15) for all male recipients, 1.18
(95% CI, 0.82 to 1.69) for male recipients aged 0 through 17
years, and 1.43 (95% CI, 1.13 to 1.82) for male recipients aged
18 through 50 years (Table 3). For female recipients, the HR
for death after 1 additional unit of red blood cells from an ever-
pregnant female donor, compared with a male donor, was 0.99
(95% CI, 0.93 to 1.07).
Additional Results
Cumulative incidences of death, in the single-transfusion
cohort, at different follow-up times, are reported in eFigure
3 and eTable 5 in the Supplement. eTable 3 reports the distri-
bution of donor types according to recipient sex and plasma
and platelets transfusions received. Data on numbers of
recipients, transfusions, and deaths per subgroup—also for
all female donors combined, regardless of pregnancy
history—are reported in eTable 2 and eTables 6-8 in the
Supplement. Results of analyses of red blood cells corrected
for plasma and platelet transfusions are reported in eTables
9-10 in the Supplement. Results of analyses for female
donors with unknown pregnancy history are shown in
eTable 11 and eFigure 4 in the Supplement. A direct compari-
son between ever-pregnant and never-pregnant female
donors is reported in eTable 12 in the Supplement. Analyses
of platelet transfusions are reported in eTables 13-14 in the
Supplement.

patients had received only a single transfusion. Follow-up time was censored at
the time this inclusion criterion was violated. Median follow-up for male
recipients of red blood cell transfusions exposed to male donors, 16
(interquartile range [IQR], 1-780) days; to female ever-pregnant donors, 12 (IQR,
1-567) days; and to female never-pregnant donors, 14 (IQR, 1-563) days. Median
follow-up for female recipients of red blood cell transfusions exposed to male
donors, 24 (IQR, 1-846) days; to female ever-pregnant donors, 21 (IQR, 1-584)
days; to female never-pregnant donors, 17 (IQR, 1-640) days.

 mortality of male recipients was different for recipients of
different ages, as indicated by the P value for interaction
trend (Table 3).
Similarly, the differences between male and female recipi-
ents in the strength of association of transfusions from ever-
pregnant donors with mortality of recipients 50 years and
younger were statistically significant (P = .03 for interaction
for the no-donor-mixture cohort, P = .01 for the single-
transfusion cohort, and P = .01 for the full cohort).
Discussion
Theresultsfromthislargeretrospectivecohortstudysuggestthat
theassociationoftransfusionsofredbloodcellsfromfemaledo-
nors with increased mortality among male recipients was re-
lated to the pregnancy history of female donors and the age of
thepatient.Malerecipientswhoreceivedatransfusionfroman
ever-pregnant female donor had a statistically significant in-
crease in mortality compared with those who received a trans-
fusion from a male donor or from a female donor without a his-
toryofpregnancy.Therewasnosignificantassociationbetween
pregnancy status of female donors of red blood cells and mor-
tality among female recipients of red blood cell transfusions.
The association of increased mortality among male pa-
tients who received transfusions from ever-pregnant donors
suggestsapossiblemechanismbasedonimmunologicchanges
occurring during pregnancy. Of all changes occurring during
pregnancy, the immunologic ones are the most enduring. An
alternative explanation could be a difference in iron status be-
tween ever-pregnant female and male donors. Iron defi-
ciencyindonorshasrecentlybeenshowntobeassociatedwith
worse recovery of red blood cells after transfusion in a mu-
rine model.17 Some studies also report differences in red blood
cell physiology between the sexes.13-17 Results from studies on
the association of donor sex and recipient mortality, includ-
ing the current study, tend to be consistent in showing
associationsformalerecipientsbutnotforfemalerecipients.2-6
This specificity for male recipients seems difficult to explain
based on differences in red blood cell physiology, supporting
a possible role for a sex-specific immunologic mechanism. It
is difficult to predict whether the small amount of plasma in
red blood cell transfusions contains enough antibodies to con-
fer an increased risk of mortality, but it cannot be ruled out.
Furthermore, leukocyte-depleted red blood cell transfusions
routinely contain fewer than 1 million leukocytes. However,
to allow for naturally occurring variation, quality control stan-
dards allow up to 5 million leukocytes in a small percentage
of products. These could include both antigen-specific lym-
phocytes or regulatory T cells.
Somedifferencesexistbetweenresultsreportedfromstud-
ies on the association between donor sex and recipient
mortality.2-6 These differences could, in the light of the cur-
rent results, potentially be explained by a combination of dif-
ferences in prevalence of a history of pregnancy among do-
nors and differences in age distribution of recipients.
This study has several strengths. The large size of the co-
hort allowed selection of the no-donor-mixture cohort and en-
abled study of patients who received blood transfusions from
only 1 type of donor (ie, male vs previously pregnant female
vs never pregnant female). However, the selection of a no-
donor-mixture cohort could limit generalizability. The recipi-
ents in the no-donor-mixture cohort receive fewer transfu-
sions, since the probability of receiving mixed transfusions
increases with the total number of transfusions. Similarly, the
censoring of recipients who received 16 or more transfusions
could limit generalizability to this group.
This study also has limitations. First, the difference in ef-
fectsizeanddirectionbetweenmaleandfemalerecipientswas
not significant among recipients of all ages, only among those
50 years and younger. This makes the findings very tentative,
and they require validation in other studies. Second, this study
was retrospective, and data were recorded for routine clinical
practice and not specifically for this study. This could cause
both inaccuracy of data and unavailability of data. Third, there
were missing data, particularly regarding pregnancy status for
the women donating red blood cells. Fourth, information on
cause of death was not available. Fifth, there may have been
residual confounding or confounding by an unidentified vari-
able. Sixth, the analysis included a large number of compari-
sons, but there was no adjustment for multiple comparisons.
Conclusions
Among patients who received red blood cell transfusions, re-
ceipt of a transfusion from an ever-pregnant female donor,
compared with a male donor, was associated with increased
all-cause mortality among male recipients but not among
female recipients. Transfusions from never-pregnant female
donors were not associated with increased mortality among
male or female recipients. Further research is needed to rep-
licate these findings, determine their clinical significance, and
identify the underlying mechanism.
