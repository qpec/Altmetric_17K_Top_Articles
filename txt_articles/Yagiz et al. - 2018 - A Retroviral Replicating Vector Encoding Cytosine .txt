Treatment of tumors with Toca 511, a gamma retroviral
replicating vector encoding cytosine deaminase, followed by 5-flu-
orocytosine (5-FC) kills tumors by local production of 5-fluoro-
uracil (5-FU). In brain tumor models, this treatment induces
systemic anti-tumor immune responses and long-term immune-
mediated survival. Phase 1 Toca 511 and Toca FC (extended-
release 5-FC) clinical trials in patients with recurrent high-grade
glioma show durable complete responses and promising survival
data compared to historic controls. The work described herein
served to expand on our earlier findings in two models of metasta-
tic colorectal carcinoma (mCRC). Intravenous (i.v.) delivery of
Toca 511 resulted in substantial tumor-selective uptake of vector
into metastatic lesions. Subsequent treatment with 5-FC resulted
in tumor shrinkage, improved survival, and immune memory
against future rechallenge with the same CT26 CRC cell line.
Similar results were seen in a brain metastasis model of mCRC.
Of note, 5-FC treatment resulted in a significant decrease in
myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in mCRC tumors in
both the liver and brain. These results support the development
of Toca 511 and Toca FC as a novel immunotherapeutic approach
for patients with mCRC. A phase 1 study of i.v. Toca 511 and Toca
FC in solid tumors, including mCRC, is currently underway
(NCT02576665).
INTRODUCTION
Toca 511 (vocimagene amiretrorepvec), a retroviral replicating vec-
tor, selectively replicates and spreads in malignant cells and encodes
an optimized yeast cytosine deaminase (CD) protein. Toca 511 is de-
signed to selectively infect cancer cells because retroviral replicating
vectors (RRVs) selectively infect cancer cells because viral replication
is restricted by innate and adaptive immune responses that are defec-
tive in malignant cells but intact in normal tissues.1,2 As a further
restriction to cancer cells, RRVs only infect actively dividing cells.
In infected cells, CD enzyme is expressed and converts 5-fluorocyto-
sine (5-FC) (an oral anti-fungal drug) to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)
(an anti-cancer drug). Our previous data demonstrated that Toca
511 administered intratumorally results in tumor cell death and pro-
vides a long-term survival benefit against brain cancer in preclinical
models.1,3–5 Administration of Toca 511 and subsequent treatment
with the prodrug 5-FC is designed to generate higher levels of 5-FU
in the tumor than can be achieved with systemic 5-FU delivery, allow-
ing 5-FU tumor killing with fewer systemic toxicities. Direct tumor
cytotoxicity and extended survival attributed to immunotherapeutic
effects have been reported using this approach.1,4–6
Approximately 50% of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) develop
metastases (mCRC) during the course of the disease, with liver being
the most frequent site. Standard treatment for mCRC is 5-FU-based
combination therapy, which extends median survival from 6 to
24 months.7 Brain metastases (BMs) from colorectal cancer are his-
torically quite rare, representing only 4%–6% of all BM cases.8,9 How-
ever, because first-line treatments are improving survival, brain
metastasis is now becoming more frequent.10,11 The current treat-
ment options for BM from colorectal cancer include surgery or ste-
reotactic radiosurgery, with or without whole-brain radiotherapy
and, in rare cases, chemotherapy.12 However, the prognosis for pa-
tients with BMs from colorectal cancer remains poor, with median
survival ranging from 2 to 15 months.13 Further, trials with new
immunotherapeutic agents have had a limited therapeutic impact
on mCRC.14 Taken together, mCRC represents an area in which
novel therapeutic approaches are desperately needed.
Recent studies suggest myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)
contribute to cancer immune evasion by suppressing anti-tumor im-
mune response.15–18 MDSCs are immature myeloid cells that are
attracted to, and develop in, the tumor microenvironment by tu-
mor-associated signals, and once there, continue to proliferate and
actively suppress the immune system through multiple mechanisms.
MDSCs are thought to be a key player in setting up and maintaining
local immune suppression in numerous cancers, including mCRC.19

 MDSCs; however, it has been shown that 5-FU can deplete MDSCs,20
presumably because of their continued proliferation and low levels of
thymidylate synthase.21 Therefore, treatment with Toca 511 and 5-FC
to generate high local concentrations of 5-FU at the site of the tumor
may have additional benefits outside of its ability to directly kill tumor
cells. 5-FU may also confer an immunotherapeutic effect through
depletion of highly immunosuppressive cells from the tumor micro-
environment. There is a clear unmet medical need for new treatments
for liver and brain metastases, and immunotherapeutic strategies that
impact immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments appear to be
useful candidates for this role. We show here that treatment with
Toca 511 and 5-FC incorporates such a strategy.
We assessed the effects of Toca 511 and 5-FC treatment on survival
and anti-tumor immune activation in syngeneic models of CRC
metastases to the liver and brain. The results reported here support
the development of Toca 511 and Toca FC as a novel immunothera-
peutic approach for patients with mCRC and potentially other
metastatic solid tumors. Toca 511 administered locally or intrave-
nously (i.v.) combined with oral Toca FC (extended release 5-FC)
is under investigation in patients with recurrent primary brain tumors
(NCT01156584, NCT01470794, NCT02414165, and NCT01985256).
Potential benefits have been observed, including durable complete re-
sponses, extended overall survival compared to historic controls, and
a favorable safety profile.22 A phase 1 study of i.v. Toca 511 followed
by cycles of oral Toca FC in patients with solid tumors, including
mCRC, is currently underway (NCT02576665).
RESULTS
Toca 511 in Combination with 5-FC Prolonged Survival in a Liver
Metastasis Model of mCRC
Survival was assessed in a multifocal liver metastasis model of murine
mCRC after treatment with Toca 511 and 5-FC. In order to monitor
tumor take and progression, CT26 cells were engineered to express
luciferase (CT26-Luc) and mice were monitored through noninvasive
imaging throughout the study (Figures 1A, S1A, and S1B). Mice that
were inoculated intrasplenically with Toca 511 pre-transduced
CT26-Luc cells developed liver metastases as early as 6 days after inoc-
ulation. 5-FC treatment cycles were initiated on day 13 and continued
for a total of 6 cycles. All animals in the PBS control group showed tu-
mor progression, as evidenced by increased bioluminescence signal
over time. The Toca-511- and 5-FC-treated animals showed slower tu-
mor progression than the control group after 6 cycles of 5-FC treat-
ment. On average, progression in the Toca 511 and 5-FC treatment
group was blunted over time and stabilized through cycles of 5-FC
(Figures 1B and S1B). Treatment with 5-FC resulted in prolonged sur-
vival compared to PBS control (p = 0.05) (Figure 1C). Five of 9 tumor-
bearing mice (55%) remained tumor free after cessation of 5-FC until
the end of the study (day 90). Prolonged survival after cessation of
treatment suggested that survival was at least partially due to the in-
duction of anti-tumor immune response. To further evaluate the effect
of Toca 511 and 5-FC treatment on the induction of anti-tumor im-
mune responses, CT26 cells were implanted into the right flanks of
“cured” mice as well as naive, age-matched mice on day 90 after the
original intrasplenic tumor implant. Tumors engrafted and grew in
all naive animals; however, tumors were rejected in mice that had pre-
viously cleared CT26 liver metastases through treatment with Toca
511 and 5-FC (p = 0.028 versus naive) (Figure 1D). Animals that
received Toca 511 and 5-FC did not exhibit signs of toxicity (Table S1).
Toca 511 Efficiently Infects and Spreads in Multifocal Liver
Metastases after Intrasplenic, i.v., or Intraportal Delivery
In order to obtain maximal spread of Toca 511, initial distribution of
vector through an optimal delivery modality is a key factor. In this
study, instrasplenic, i.v., and intraportal vein routes were compared
to evaluate vector delivery to multifocal liver metastases. 3 days
post cell inoculations, one dose of vector (3.4 � 107 TU) was delivered
via three different routes. A GPF-expressing vector (Toca GFP) was
utilized in order to facilitate imaging of the vector within metastases
in the liver. Metastatic lesions, as mentioned above, expressed lucif-
erase and were therefore visualized by bioluminescence imaging.
18 days post vector administration, all delivery routes resulted in vec-
tor expression in tumor foci, but not in normal liver tissue (Figure 2A).
Excised multifocal liver metastases were also analyzed by flow cytom-
etry. The average percentage of GFP+ cells for intrasplenic, i.v., and
intraportal delivery modalities were similar: 7.8 ± 0.9, 8.2 ± 1.2, and
6.2 ± 1.6, respectively (Figure 2B). i.v. vector administration was
selected for all subsequent experiments. A total of three consecutive
doses of Toca GFP versus a single dose of i.v. delivery of Toca GFP
resulted in higher average GFP+ cells, as seen by vector spread at 14
and 22 days post vector administration (Figure 2C).
i.v. Delivery of Toca 511 and Treatment with 5-FC Was
Efficacious in a Murine Liver Metastasis Model of mCRC
Althoughpre-transduced CT26cellsprovidedinsight into the feasibility
of treating metastatic disease with this therapeutic platform, we wanted
to confirm these results in a clinically relevant delivery model. There-
fore, in order to assess the therapeutic efficacy of 5-FC treatment after
i.v. delivery of Toca 511, an additional survival study was conducted.
Mice were administered 5 consecutive (one injection per day for
5 days) i.v. injections of Toca 511 (6.6 � 107 TU/injection/day) starting
4 days post tumor cell inoculation, followed by six cycles of 5-FC. An-
imals that were treated with 5-FC lived significantly longer compared
to PBS control (p = 0.037) (Figures 3A, S1A, and S2B). Six of 9 mice re-
mained tumor free, even after cessation of 5-FC (Figures 3B and S2B).
Complete blood counts were collected at 17, 25, and 35 days post cell
inoculations. 5-FC treatment caused a transient decrease in white blood
cell (WBC), lymphocyte (LYM), neutrophil (NEU), and platelet (PLT)
counts after the first and second 5-FC cycles compared to PBS treat-
ment. However, values were above the lower limits of normal (LLN)
by the end of the fourth cycle of 5-FC treatment (Figure 3D). Modest
lymphoid suppression was observed with the use of Toca 511 and
5-FC relative to systemic 5-FU. As above, CT26 cells were implanted
into the right flanks of cured as well as naive, age-matched, mice on
day 90 after the original intrasplenic tumor implantation. Tumors en-
grafted and grew in all naive animals; however, tumors were rejected
inmicethat hadpreviously cleared CT26liver metastasesthrough treat-
ment with Toca 511 and 5-FC (p = 0.001) (Figure 3C).

 i.v. Delivery of Toca 511, Followed by Treatment with 5-FC,
Resulted in Concentrated 5-FU within Liver Metastases in a
Murine Model of mCRC
Because Toca 511 gene transfer of CD enzyme is designed to
convert the well-tolerated prodrug 5-FC into the potent anti-
metabolite 5-FU in infected tumor cells, we expect that prolonged
presence of high 5-FU concentrations is likely to enhance the
antitumor effect. 23 days post cell inoculation, pharmacokinetics
of 5-FC and 5-FU were evaluated after the seventh adminis-
tration of 5-FC (500 mg/kg BID) in CRC liver metastases and
plasma. Mean 5-FU levels in tumor and plasma were 75 mg/g
and 10 mg/mL, respectively, 1 hr after the final 5-FC dose (Fig-
ure 4). Gastrointestinal toxicity, a common toxicity of 5-FU, was
not observed.

 Systemic 5-FU Treatment Was Not Efficacious in a Murine Liver
Metastasis Model of mCRC and Resulted in Hematological
Toxicity
Efficacy of systemic 5-FU was tested in the CT26 syngeneic liver metas-
tasis model and was used as a positive control in the evaluation of
Toca 511 and 5-FC therapy. First, hematological toxicity of systemic
5-FU treatment was determined after delivery at 20 mg/kg/day and
40 mg/kg/day for 5 consecutive days, followed by 2 days without the
drug in non-tumor-bearing mice. The dose of 40 mg/kg/day was lethal
to mice. The 20 mg/kg/day dose caused leukopenia but was not lethal to
mice (Figure S3). For efficacy studies, 5-FU was administered to tumor-
bearing animals at 20 mg/kg/day for 5 consecutive days, followed by
2 days without drug for a total of 4 cycles. A control group was treated
with5-FC(500mg/kgBID).TheseanimalsdidnotreceiveToca511and
represent a negative control. The median survival of animals treated
with 5-FU was not significantly different than the 5-FC negative control
group (35 days versus 30 days, respectively; p = 0.7). Additionally, there
were no long-term survivors with 5-FU treatments after four cycles of

 treatments (Figure 5A), and therefore it was not possible to perform a
tumor rechallenge experiment with this regime. WBC, LYM, and
NEU counts were above the LLN during the four cycles of 5-FC treat-
ment. However, systemic 5-FU treatment caused reductions in WBC,
LYM, and NEU values, with counts below the LLN (Figure 5B).
Toca 511 and 5-FC Treatment in a Murine Model of Colorectal
Liver Metastases Induced a Systemic Anti-tumor Immune
Response
To investigate the potential role of MDSCs in Toca 511 and 5-FC
mechanism of action, we measured MDSCs in Toca 511 and 5-FC
and Toca 511 and PBS treatment groups in metastatic liver foci.
CD11b, Gr-1, and Ly6C were used to define myeloid cell popula-
tions. CD11b, in general, defines cells of myeloid lineage. The anti-
body against Gr-1 binds to both Ly6C and Ly6G, which defines
MDSCs because these cells exist as a heterogeneous population of
cells that express markers of both monocytes (Ly6C) and neutro-
phils (Ly6G). Therefore, by staining cells with both antibodies
against Gr-1 as well as Ly6C, we were able to define three subsets
of cells. Gr-1+Ly6C+ cells are defined here as MDSCs, whereas
Gr-1+Ly6C� cells are neutrophils and Gr-1�Ly6C cells are mono-
cytes. CT26 liver metastatic foci were collected throughout the

 study. Myeloid cells (CD11b), MDSCs, and neutrophils were all
significantly depleted with treatment. Monocytes were not signifi-
cantly reduced here, albeit a trend toward reduction was observed
(Figure 6B).
Toca 511 and 5-FC Prolonged Survival in a Brain Metastasis
Model of mCRC
Toca 511 pre-transduced CT26 cells were implanted in the right
hemisphere, followed by treatment, with a total of four cycles of
5-FC beginning on day 10 after tumor implantation. As expected,
treatment of mice bearing colorectal brain metastases with 5-FC re-
sulted in prolonged survival compared with PBS control (p = 0.001)
(Figure 7A). Seven out of twelve (58%) tumor-bearing animals re-
mained tumor-free 65 days after intracranial (i.c.) CT26 implanta-
tion. These tumor-free animals and age-matched naive mice were
given a subcutaneous tumor challenge. Tumors engrafted and
grew in all naive animals challenged with parental CT26 cells but
not in mice that had cleared CT26 colorectal brain metastases after
treatment with Toca 511 and 5-FC (Figure 7B). Splenocytes from
mice that cleared colorectal brain metastases through treatment
were used in adoptive transfer experiments in nude mice. Subcu-
taneous CT26 tumor progression was slower in animals receiving
splenocytes from cured animals compared to control (p = 0.045)
(Figure 7C). These results also support the conclusion that immune
components play a role in maintaining long-term survival in mice
treated with Toca 511 and 5-FC.
Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells Decreased after Toca 511
and 5-FC Treatment in a Murine Model of Colorectal Brain
Metastasis
i.c. tumors, which were pre-transduced with Toca 511 prior to tumor
implantation, were excised at 14 days post injection (after one cycle
of 5-FC). The tumors were disaggregated to single-cell suspensions
and the proportions of different immune cell types in the tumor
were investigated by FACS analysis. MDSCs (CD11b+ Gr-1+
Ly6C+) were detected in CT26 brain tumors and spleens of tumor-
bearing animals. MDSCs were significantly decreased in tumors
pre-transduced with Toca 511 and treated with one cycle of 5-FC
compared to PBS control (p < 0.0001; Figure 8A). In tumors, MDSCs
were 5.9% ± 2.8% of total live lymphocytes, of which more were gran-
ulocytic (G-MDSCs, CD11b+ Grhi Ly6C�; 25.6% ± 2.9% of total
MDSCs) than monocytic (Mo-MDSCs, CD11b+ Gr1lo Ly6C+;
5.5% ± 1.2% of total MDSCs) in the PBS treatment group. Treatment
with 5-FC significantly decreased the infiltration of monocytic
MDSCs (2.4% ± 0.5% of total MDSCs) (*p = 0.003 versus PBS) (Fig-
ure S4). Neutrophils were reduced in the Toca 511 treatment group
after one cycle of 5-FC treatment compared to the PBS control group
(p = 0.04) (Figure S5). A significant decrease in the proportion of
MDSC in spleens was also observed in the Toca 511 treatment group
after one cycle of 5-FC treatment compared to the PBS control group
(p = 0.03; Figure 8B). In line with previous data that showed the con-
centration of therapeutic response at the site of the tumor, there was
no significant impact on myeloid cell populations in the bone marrow
(Figure S6), suggesting that Toca 511 and 5-FC does not induce mye-
losuppression in bone marrow, which is seen with traditional chemo-
therapeutic regimens.
DISCUSSION
CRC is the third most common cancer in the Western hemisphere,
with high metastatic incidences and poor overall survival.23,24 First-
line treatment failure results in local recurrence and distant metasta-
ses to vital organs, most commonly the liver.25 Additionally, although
brain involvement is less common, improved treatment protocols are
resulting in longer survival, which ultimately manifests in an observed
increase in the incidence of metastasis to the brain.11,13,26–28 Eluci-
dating the efficacy and underlying effects of treatment of metastatic
disease requires a mouse model that recapitulates involvement of
secondary organs. Therefore, we developed the metastatic models
described here to investigate the efficacy of a novel therapeutic
approach using a prodrug activating gene therapy: retroviral repli-
cating vector encoding cytosine deaminase, Toca 511, and subsequent
treatment with 5-FC.
Here, we utilized a mouse model that consistently gives rise to multi-
focal liver metastases in an immune-competent syngeneic host
through intrasplenic implantation of a well-characterized mouse
CRC cell line, CT26. We showed that i.v. administration of Toca
511 was as efficient a delivery modality as intrasplenic or intraportal
administration and, followed by cycles of 5-FC treatment, achieved
complete tumor regression. In addition, we modeled CRC brain
metastasis by direct surgical implantation of CT26 cells into the right
hemisphere of the brain because brain metastases from CRC often pre-
sent as single cerebral lesions. Long-term survival was also achieved in
this model after treatment with Toca 511, followed by cycles of 5-FC.
Our current models provide important support for the utility of Toca
511 and 5-FC in the clinical treatment of CRC-derived metastases and
potentially other solid tumor metastases as well.

 Toca 511 in combination with 5-FC is designed to generate high levels
of 5-FU locally in the tumor, without generating high levels of sys-
temic 5-FU.1 Earlier, we reported that Toca 511 was distributed
throughout the tumor when delivered i.v., which may enhance the po-
tential for the vector to infect and spread to more tumor cells and for
the bystander effect of 5-FU to be more widespread.4 Recently, we re-
ported that 5-FU concentrations were significantly higher in the
tumor compared to plasma in an intraperitoneal (i.p.) model using
Toca 511 pre-transduced CT26 cells (200 mg/g and 0.48 mg/mL,
respectively)29 and in a brain cancer model using Toca 511 pre-trans-
duced F98 rat glioma cells (69.8 mg/g and 0.37 mg/mL, respectively). In
our current work, pharmacokinetic analysis confirmed that concen-
trations of 5-FU were greater in the tumor than in the plasma in these
models of mCRC. Because the desired cytotoxic effect is concentrated
at the site of the tumor, 5-FU production after Toca 511 and 5-FC
treatment spares tissues and cells that are typically affected with sys-
temic 5-FU exposure.
A large body of evidence has shown that 5-FU systemic exposure is
the major contributor to dose-limiting toxicities and, ultimately, tu-
mor treatment failure.30,31 In fact, studies have indicated that only
20%–30% of patients treated with a 5-FU-based regimen have 5-FU
levels that are in the appropriate therapeutic range. Approximately
40%–60% of patients are underdosed, and 10%–20% of patients expe-
rience severe systemic toxicities.32 Importantly, treatment with 5-FU
often causes hematologic toxicity, resulting in a narrow therapeutic
index. As reported here, tumor-bearing animals treated with systemic
5-FU had lower blood counts compared to the control treatment and
limited efficacy due to dose-limiting toxicities. However, Toca 511
and 5-FC treatment, with a known short half-life in blood,33 results
in primarily intratumoral 5-FU production that resulted in modest
lymphoid suppression relative to systemic 5-FU treatment,5,29,34
thus avoiding this limitation.
Immunosuppression mediated by MDSCs has been shown in several
colorectal cancer models, and levels of MDSCs in colorectal cancers in
patients correlate with poor outcomes.35 Further, inhibition or deple-
tion of MDSCs has been shown to enhance anti-tumor immu-
nity.17,18,36 Interestingly, some cytotoxic agents, such as gemcitabine,
cisplatin, paclitaxel, and 5-FU, have been found to deplete MDSCs
both systemically and in the tumor microenvironment.20,37–39
Recently, in a subcutaneous Tu-2449 glioma model, we have demon-
strated that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), tumor-associ-

 Toca 511 and 5-FC treatment and continued to be reduced until tu-
mor clearance. Moreover, those animals that cleared tumors through
treatment with Toca 511 and 5-FC were protected from subsequent
tumor rechallenge, suggesting that immune activation and the
ensuing antitumor immunity was associated with depletion of immu-
nosuppressive MDSCs.40 In the current study, MDSC populations
were also monitored in tumor-bearing animals after Toca 511 and
5-FC treatment. As expected, MDSCs were significantly reduced after
Toca 511 and 5-FC treatment in both liver and brain metastatic
models. As a correlate, strong antitumor activity was observed after
Toca 511 and 5-FC treatment.
Because MDSCs are a heterogeneous population of myeloid cells with
a multitude of immune-suppressive capabilities, including several
mechanisms by which they directly induce T cell suppression.15,41,42
MDSCs can be divided phenotypically into granulocytic (G-MDSC)
and monocytic (Mo-MDSC) subgroups and each have demonstrated
immunosuppressive properties.43,44 The G-MDSCs produce high
levels of ROS but only nominal amounts of NO, indicating that
ROS are the primary mediators of their suppressive functions.45,46
In contrast, Mo-MDSCs express high levels of NO and low levels of
ROS, and they effectively suppress T cell function in both antigen-
dependent and -independent manners, without requiring cell-cell
contact.47 It has been suggested that the tumor microenvironment
could have an impact, either favoring or repelling preferential migra-
tion of MDSC subtypes.48 In our brain metastatic model, G-MDSCs
were the most prevalent subtype in the tumor microenvironment.
Figure 6. Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells
Decreased with Toca 511 and 5-FC Treatment in a
Liver Metastasis Model of mCRC
Liver metastases treated with 5-FC visually show a
decrease in MDSC populations. Mice were administered
three cycles of 5-FC (500 mg/kg, i.p., BID) or PBS. (A)
Immunofluorescence color staining of CD11b (myeloid
cells), Gr-1 (monocytes and neutrophils), Ly6C (mono-
cytes), and Gr-1/Ly6C (MDSCs) confirms decrease of
expression with treatment of 5-FC. (B) Quantitative anal-
ysis of percentage area (n = 6) of CD11b, Gr-1, and Ly6C
show decrease of MDSCs with treatment of 5-FC
compared with PBS. *Statistical significance was defined
as p < 0.05. Error bars represent SEM.
However, Toca 511 and 5-FC treatment signif-
icantly reduced the Mo-MDSC population.
Treatment with 5-FU has been shown to induce
selective
apoptosis
of
MDSCs,
thereby
decreasing the burden of these cells in the
murine
spleen
and
tumor
environment,
but without depleting host T cells, natural
killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells, or B cells, and
promoted T cell-dependent anti-tumor re-
sponses.20 Therefore, the elimination of MDSCs
represents a promising approach in cancer ther-
apy. Future studies are needed to determine
suppressive activities of different subsets of MDSCs that could
improve the development of novel interventions for cancer treatment
in colorectal metastases.
5-FU has been used for more than 50 years in the treatment of CRC.
To improve the clinical efficacy of 5-FU, combined therapies or
changes in the schedule of administration of 5-FU from bolus to
continuous infusion, or both, have been actively investigated.49 The
most common U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved
protocols for CRC treatment have been combined chemotherapies
FOLFIRI (folinic acid, 5-FU, and irinotecan) or FOLFOX (folinic
acid, 5-FU, and oxaliplatin).35 The introduction of drugs such as bev-
acizumab,50,51 cetuximab,52 and panitumumab53 have improved the
median survival of patients with advanced metastatic disease from
10 to 12 months to almost 24 months.7,54 However, despite its limited
therapeutic index, 5-FU has remained the main agent for the treat-
ment of both advanced and early-stage CRC.
In conclusion, our data from disease-relevant in vivo tumor models
suggest that Toca 511 and 5-FC is safe, efficacious, and represents a
novel tumoricidal and immunotherapeutic approach for the treat-
ment of liver and brain metastases for patients with mCRC. Impor-
tantly, this work demonstrates that Toca 511 in conjunction with
5-FC promotes both direct killing of tumor cells by local production
of 5-FU and induction of a local and systemic immunotherapeutic
response, resulting in long-term survival by selectively depleting a
highly immunosuppressive population of cells, MDSCs. We believe

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Drugs and Reagents
5-FC for in vivo assays was synthesized to order by a contract chem-
ical supplier. 5-FU was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO). D-Luciferin was purchased from Biotium (Hayward, CA).
Retroviral Replicating Vectors
A detailed description of Toca 511 vector design and modification has
been previously published.55 Toca GFP is the same as Toca 511, with
the GFP gene in place of the CD gene. Toca 511 (3.3 � 108 TU/mL)
and Toca GFP (1.7 � 108 TU/mL) were used for all experiments.
Cell Lines
The mouse colon carcinoma cell line CT26 (CRL 2638) was pur-
chased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas,
VA). CT26-Lluc was generated from the parental CT26 cell line by
transduction with CMV-Luc-IRES-Neo lentivirus (University of Cal-
ifornia, Los Angeles, CA) encoding luciferase and a Geneticin resis-
tance gene, followed by selection with Geneticin (G418) (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). CT26 parental cells and CT26-
Luc cells were each infected with either Toca 511 or Toca GFP vector
to create CT26-T511, CT26-Luc T511, and CT26-GFP. All cell lines
were cultured as described.1
Mice and In-Life Observations
Female BALB/cJ mice (aged �8 weeks) were purchased from Jackson
Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, or Sacramento, CA). Athymic nude

BID) (n = 12) or PBS (n = 5). Treatments started at day 10 post cell inoculation and were for 7 days on and 7 days off for four cycles. Survival was examined out to 150 days.
(B) Long-term survivors (n = 5) were rechallenged subcutaneously at day 65 post intracranial tumor implant with parental CT26 cells, and tumor growth was monitored over
time. As a control, CT26 cells were implanted into naive, age-matched, BALB/cJ mice (n = 5) (*p = 0.0001; naive versus Toca 511+5-FC). (C) Recipient athymic animals
received splenocytes from either cured or naive animals and were inoculated subcutaneously with parental CT26 cells and tumor growth was monitored over time

 mice were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). Mice were
acclimated for 7–14 days after arrival. Routine general health, in-life
observations, and body weights were collected throughout the course
of the study. In-life observations were scored on a 0–4 point system
for severity of each symptom. Mice with a cumulative score of 5
were euthanized. Mice with body weight loss of more 20% for more
than 2 days were euthanized. All animal protocols and experiments
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Bioluminescence Imaging
Tumor growth was measured using the IVIS Imaging system
(PerkinElmer,
Waltham,
MA).
Mice
were
anesthetized
with
isoflurane, and 10 min after i.p. administration with D-luciferin
(126 mg/kg), bioluminescent signals were analyzed with a 45-s acqui-
sition time.
Orthotopic Liver Metastasis Model of mCRC
The syngeneic cell line CT26 was used as a tumor model in BALB/cJ
mice. Various vector delivery routes were examined to optimize vec-
tor delivery. On day 0, mice underwent intrasplenic implantation of
3.5 � 105 CT26-Luc666. On day 4, mice were injected with 200 mL
Toca GFP or Toca 511 intrasplenically, intraportally, or i.v. infusion
over a minute, followed by a hold of 2 min. 1 week post vector, tumors
were excised into media containing 1x DNase (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO) and 1x Collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and
placed on a shaker for 1 hr. After incubation, tumors were filtered
through a 40-mM filter, centrifuged, and resuspended in DMEM
media and analyzed by flow cytometry for GFP expression (BD
FACS Canto II).
For therapeutic experiments, on day 0, mice underwent intrasplenic
implantation of either 3.5 � 105 Toca 511 pre-transduced CT26-
Luc or parental CT26-Luc cells. Splenectomy was done immediately
after tumor cell inoculation. Starting on day 4, mice inoculated with
CT26-Luc cells were injected with 200 mL i.v. Toca 511 for 5 consec-
utive days. Mice inoculated with Toca 511 pre-transduced CT26-Luc
cells did not receive any vector injections. Starting on day 13, mice
that received Toca 511 were treated with either PBS or 5-FC
(500 mg/kg/dose) i.p. BID for 5 consecutive days, followed by
2 days without drug. Cycles of 5 days on, 2 days off of drug treatment
were repeated.
Toxicity Studies in Multifocal Liver Metastasis
BALB/cJ mice bearing multifocal liver metastasis were given i.p. injec-
tions of 5-FC (500 mg/kg/dose BID) or 5-FU (20 mg/kg/day SID)
treatments for 5 consecutive days, followed by 2 days without
drug for every week, for a total of 4 weeks. Blood samples were
collected and then transferred to Explora BioLabs (San Diego, CA)
Figure 8. Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells Decreased with Toca 511 and 5-FC Treatment in a Brain Metastasis Model of mCRC

 for hematology analysis. A complete blood count, including values for
WBCs, LYMs, NEUs, and PLTs were obtained using an VetScan HM2
hematology analyzer (ABAXIS, Union City, CA) following the man-
ufacturer’s instructions. LLN was determined based on strain and age
of the animals tested.
Pharmacokinetic Analysis of 5-FU and 5-FC in Multifocal Liver
Metastasis Model
Plasma and tumor pharmacokinetics of 5-FC and 5-FU were studied
in a multifocal liver metastasis model. In the first study, mice inocu-
lated with Toca 511 pre-transduced CT26-Luc were treated with
either PBS or 5-FC (500 mg/kg i.p. BID) for 3.5 days. In the second
study, mice inoculated with CT26-Luc cells received 5-day i.v. Toca
511 and were treated with one full cycle of 5-FC or PBS. During the
second cycle of treatment, mice received 3.5 days of treatment. For
both studies, 1 hr after the last injections, whole blood samples
were collected into EDTA-treated tubes. Cells were removed from
plasma by centrifugation for 2 min at 1,000–2,000 � g. Plasma sam-
ples were frozen into liquid nitrogen. Tumors were immediately
excised, weighed, and directly frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Quantitative determination of 5-FU and 5-FC in samples was
done using supported liquid extraction (SLE) and hydrophilic inter-
action chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection
(LC-MS/MS). Analyses of the samples were performed by the South-
ern Research Institute (Birmingham, AL). 5-FC/5-FU was equally
detectable in both plasma and tumor samples. Concentrations of
incurred and quality control samples were calculated with the same
regression analysis. Results were converted into mg 5-FU and 5-FC
per g of tissue or plasma.
Immunofluorescence of MDSCs
Multiple liver metastases cells were detected for CD11b, Gr-1, and
Ly6C. To examine MDSC populations, mice were perfused with 4%
paraformaldehyde (PFA). Livers were collected and fixed in 4%
PFA overnight, washed with PBS and 70% ethanol, tissue processed,
and embedded into paraffin. MDSC immunostaining was performed
for primary monoclonal rabbit antibody against CD11b (ab133357,
Abcam) with 1:250 dilution, primary monoclonal rat antibody against
Gr-1 (MAB1037, Novus Biologicals) with 1:50 dilution, and primary
monoclonal mouse antibody against Ly6C (sc-271811, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) with 1:100 dilution. For each specimen section, three
color images were acquired with a light digital microscope (Zeiss In-
struments) running under Image Pro Plus v.7.0. for Windows.
Quantitative Immunohistochemistry of MDSCs
The area based on color sampling of fluorescence by immunochem-
ical reaction was selected using the “eye dropper tool” in Image Pro
Premier. The number of selected pixels was read from the histogram
of color and the area percentage per section was then determined.
In Vivo Survival in Brain Metastasis Model
BALB/cJ mice underwent IC implantation of 1.4 � 104 Toca 511
pre-transduced CT26 cells using a sharp, gas-tight, 26G 10-mL
Hamilton syringe inserted through the burr hole on day 0. The ste-
reotaxic coordinates were anterior-posterior (AP) = 0.5 mm and
medial-lateral (ML) = 1.8 mm (from bregma). Starting on day
10, mice were treated with either PBS or 5-FC (500 mg/kg/dose)
i.p. BID for 7 consecutive days, followed by 7 days without drug
to allow vector spread. After the first 5-FC cycle, tumors and
spleens were collected for FACS analysis for MDSCs. For the
survival study, animals received 3 more cycles of 5-FC or PBS
treatments. Survival was monitored during and after cessation of
5-FC cycles.
Flow Cytometry Analysis
Spleens and tumor samples were collected from Toca 511 pre-
transduced CT26 IC tumor-bearing mice. Single-cell suspensions
were prepared from spleens. Brains tumors were diced with a razor
blade before homogenizing in RPMI medium (Hyclone, Logan,
UT) using a glass Tenbroeck homogenizer. Mononuclear cells
were purified from brain tissue by centrifugation (600 � g) through
a Percol step gradient (70%–30% Percol in PBS) for 20 min in
15-mL falcon tubes; mononuclear cells migrate to the interface be-
tween 30% and 70% Percol. The mononuclear cells on the inter-
phase were removed and then washed with fresh media. Antibodies
were purchased from eBioscience (San Diego, CA). Immune cells
were labeled with antibodies in cell surface staining buffer (1% fetal
bovine serum [FBS]) for flow cytometry analysis using a flow
cytometer (BD FACS Canto II) and analyzed with FlowJo (Tree
Star, Ashland OR) software.
Tumor Challenge and Adoptive Transfer Assays
Tumor challenge was performed on all cured mice from both multi-
focal liver and brain metastasis CT26 tumor long-term survival
studies by subcutaneous implantation of parental 5 � 105 CT26 cells
in 100 mL volume into each mouse. As a control, CT26 cells were im-
planted into age-matched naive BALB/cJ mice. Tumor measurements
were performed three times a week.
For adoptive transfer studies, cured mice were used from i.c. brain
metastasis CT26 tumor long-term survival studies. Recipient mice
were administered an i.v. injection of 5 � 106 splenocytes from
cured or naive donor mice. 4 days later, these animals were injected
with 5 � 105 CT26 tumor cells on the right flank. Tumor measure-
ments were performed three times a week.
Statistical Analyses
Survival data were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method,
and were compared by the log-rank test as noted. p values
of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant in all analyses,
which were done with Prism 5 statistical software (GraphPad
Software).
