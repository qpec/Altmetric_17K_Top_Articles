abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Flavored electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are not prohibited in 
the United States, and e-cigarette flavors proliferate on the market. This study sought to 
examine flavored e-cigarette use and its association with smoking among youth.
METHODS: Estimates of flavored e-cigarette use from the 2014 National Youth Tobacco 
Survey were investigated. A logistic regression model was used to assess whether flavored 
e-cigarette use was associated with (1) intention to initiate cigarette use among never-
smoking youth (n = 16 471), (2) intention to quit tobacco use among current-smoking youth 
(n = 1338), and (3) perception of tobacco’s danger among all respondents (n = 21 491).
RESULTS: A total of 2017 respondents reported using e-cigarettes in the last 30 days, of whom 
1228 (60.9%) reported using flavored e-cigarettes. Among never-smoking youth, 55.6% 
(288) of current e-cigarette users reported using flavored e-cigarettes. Among current 
smokers, 68.4% (495) of current e-cigarette users reported using flavored e-cigarettes. 
Compared with not using e-cigarettes in the past 30 days, using flavored e-cigarettes 
was associated with higher odds of intention to initiate cigarette use among never-
smoking youth (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 5.7; P < .0001), lower odds of intention to quit 
tobacco use among current-smoking youth (aOR = 0.6; P = .006), and a lower prevalence of 
perception of tobacco’s danger among all respondents (aOR = 0.5; P < .0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Flavored e-cigarette use is associated with increased risks of smoking among 
youth. Comprehensive tobacco control and prevention strategies that address flavored 
e-cigarette products are critically needed to reduce tobacco use among youth.

WHAT'S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Because of a 
proliferation of e-cigarette fl
 avors on the market, 
fl
 avored e-cigarette use among youth in the United 
States has increased signifi
 cantly. The majority of 
youth who have ever used e-cigarettes started with 
a fl
 avored product.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Flavored e-cigarette use 
among youth might serve as a gateway for future 
smoking and was associated with decreased odds of 
quitting smoking. Flavored e-cigarette use was also 
associated with decreased perception of tobacco’s 
danger among youth.

The number of young people using 
electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) 
in the United States has risen from 
∼780 000 in 2013 to >3 million in 
2015. 
1 One explanation for the surge 
in e-cigarette use is the availability 
of a large number of different flavors 
that might appeal to youth. One 
recent study found that the leading 
reason for youth e-cigarette use in 
2013 to 2014 was the availability of 
appealing flavors, with 81% of youth 
e-cigarette users citing this reason. 
2
Although the 2009 Family Smoking 
Prevention and Tobacco Control Act 
banned cigarettes with characterizing 
flavors (eg, candy, fruit, and clove) 
except menthol, this rule is not 
applied to e-cigarettes. 
3 As a result, 
>460 brands and 7700 flavors of 
e-cigarettes are on the market, 
including flavors such as candy crush, 
gummy bear, and bubble gum. 
4 A 
total of 63.3% of current tobacco 
users in US middle and high schools, 
or nearly 1.58 million youth, had 
used flavored e-cigarettes in 2014. 
5 
In May 2016, the US Food and Drug 
Administration finalized a rule 
extending its authority to regulate 
e-cigarettes, cigars, hookah tobacco, 
and pipe tobacco, along with other 
emerging tobacco products, 
 
6 but 
this rule does not prohibit flavored 
e-cigarettes.
Concern is growing that widespread 
availability of flavored e-cigarettes 
will increase the use of e-cigarette 
products by youth and will thus 
reinforce the acceptability of vaping 
behavior.

9 The normalization 
of e-cigarette use among youth 
could also lead to e-cigarettes 
becoming a gateway for future 
smoking, 
10 
 
– 
13 marking a setback 
in the decades-long antismoking 
battle. Furthermore, concerns have 
been raised about the potential 
inhalation toxicity of these flavorings. 
Benzaldehyde, a key ingredient in 
natural fruit flavors, has been shown 
to cause irritation of respiratory 
airways. A recent study detected 
benzaldehyde in 108 of 145 flavored 
e-cigarette products, with the highest 
levels found in cherry-flavored 
products. 
14
Little is known about the association 
between using flavored e-cigarettes 
and initiating cigarettes, quitting 
smoking, and perceiving the danger 
of tobacco among youth. This 
information is critically needed to 
understand the role of e-cigarette 
flavoring in youth tobacco use. To 
address the gaps in knowledge, we 
used data from the 2014 National 
Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS) and 
specifically sought to (1) examine 
the association between flavored 
e-cigarette use and intention to 
initiate cigarette smoking among 
never-smoking youth, (2) analyze 
the association between flavored 
e-cigarette use and intention to quit 
tobacco use in the next 12 months 
among current youth smokers, and 
(3) assess the association between 
flavored e-cigarette use and youth 
perception of the danger of tobacco.
METHODS
Data
The 2014 NYTS is a cross-sectional 
and school-based survey that 
supports estimation of the tobacco-
related knowledge, attitudes, and 
behaviors of students in middle 
school (grades 6–8) and high school 
(grades 9–12) from all 50 states and 
the District of Columbia. The 2014 
NYTS used a stratified, 3-stage cluster 
sampling procedure to generate a 
nationally representative sample of 
US middle and high school students. 
A detailed description of 2014 NYTS 
survey design, questionnaires, and 
data collection can be found on the 
NYTS Web site. 
15
In the 2014 NYTS survey, 258 schools 
were selected and 207 (80.2%) 
participated. Among 24 084 eligible 
students, 22 007 (91.4%) completed 
the questionnaires. The overall 
response rate was 73.3%. 
16 Because 
the data were de-identified and 
publically available, this study was 
exempt from institutional review 
board approval.
Measures
Flavored E-cigarette Use
Two items from the 2014 NYTS 
were used to define flavored 
e-cigarette use: (1) “During the 
past 30 days, on how many days 
did you use electronic cigarettes 
or e-cigarettes such as Blu, 21st 
Century Smoke or NJOY?”; and (2) 
“Which of the following tobacco 
products that you used in the past 
30 days were flavored to taste like 
menthol (mint), alcohol (wine, 
cognac), candy, fruit, chocolate or 
other sweets?” Students were asked 
to select from a list of options to 
designate the flavored product or 
products they had used or indicate 
that they had not used flavored 
tobacco in the past 30 days. Those 
who selected “Electronic cigarettes or 
e-cigarettes” to the second question 
were considered users of flavored 
e-cigarettes. We classified the survey 
respondents as: not current users 
of e-cigarettes (students who had 
not used e-cigarettes in the past 30 
days); current users of nonflavored 
e-cigarettes (students who had used 
e-cigarettes at least 1 day during the 
past 30 days but did not use flavored 
e-cigarettes); and current users of 
flavored e-cigarettes (students who 
had used e-cigarettes at least 1 day 
during the last 30 days and used 
flavored e-cigarettes). We excluded 
516 students whose answers were 
missing or inconsistent, resulting in 
21 491 respondents in the study.
Intention To Initiate Cigarette Use/
Quit Smoking/Perception of Tobacco’s 
Danger
The current tobacco smoking status 
was coded as never (students who 
had never smoked cigarettes), former 
(students who had smoked at least 
100 cigarettes in their lifetime but 
had not smoked in the past 30 days), 
and current smokers (students who

had smoked at least 100 cigarettes in 
their lifetime and at least 1 cigarette 
in the past 30 days) based on 2 items: 
(1) “Have you ever tried cigarette 
smoking, even one or two puffs?”; 
and (2) “During the past 30 days, 
on how many days did you smoke 
cigarettes?”
Among never-smoking youth, the 
intention to smoke cigarettes was 
measured on the basis of 2 NYTS 
questionnaire items: (1) “Do you 
think you will smoke a cigarette 
in the next year?” and (2) “Do you 
think you will try a cigarette soon?” 
Responses for these questions 
included “Definitely yes, 
” “Probably 
yes, 
” “Probably not, 
” and “Definitely 
not.” The respondents who answered 
“Definitely not” to both questions 
were classified into the group 
“no intention to initiate cigarette 
smoking.” The respondents who 
answered “Definitely yes, 
” “Probably 
yes, 
” or “Probably not” to either of 
these 2 questions were classified 
into the group “intention to initiate 
cigarette smoking.” 
17 
– 
19
Among current-smoking youth, the 
intention to quit tobacco use was 
measured by the question, “Are you 
seriously thinking about quitting the 
use of all tobacco products?” The 
respondents who answered, “Yes, 
within the next 30 days, 
” “Yes, within 
the next 6 months, 
” or “Yes, within 
the next 12 months” were classified 
into the group “intention to quit 
smoking in next 12 months.” Those 
who responded, “Yes, but not within 
the next 12 months” or “No, I am not 
thinking about quitting cigarettes” 
were classified into the group “no 
intention to quit smoking in next 12 
months.”
Among all respondents, the 
perception of tobacco’s danger was 
measured by the item, “How strongly 
do you agree with the statement ‘All 
tobacco products are dangerous’?” 
The respondents who answered 
“Strongly agree” or “Agree” were 
classified into the group “perceived 
tobacco danger, 
” and those who 
answered “Disagree” or “Strongly 
disagree” were classified into the 
group “no perceived tobacco danger.”
 
Figure 1 summarizes the study 
design and sample size for this 
analysis.
Covariates
Several covariates were included 
in the analysis to control for other 
tobacco-related influences, such as 
age, sex (boy or girl), race/ethnicity 
(non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic 
black, Hispanic, or non-Hispanic 
other), and grade (middle/high 
school). Current smoking status 
was also included as a covariate in 
assessing the association between 
flavored e-cigarette use and 
perception of tobacco’s danger.
Statistical Methods
Weighted estimates along with 
95% confidence intervals (CI) of the 
prevalence of intention to initiate 
cigarette use among never smokers, 
intention to quit tobacco use in the 
next 12 months among current 
smokers, and perception of tobacco’s 
danger among all respondents were 
calculated. Sampling weights and 
survey stratum were included in the 
analyses to account for the complex 
survey design. A logistic regression 
model was used to examine the 
associations between flavored 
e-cigarette use and tobacco use and 
perception of tobacco’s danger among 
youth. The students who reported not 
using e-cigarettes in the past 30 days 
served as the control group. Adjusted 
odds ratios (aORs) were calculated in 
the multivariate analysis. Statistical 
analyses were performed using SAS 
9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC) 
and a P value <0.05 was considered 
statistically significant.
RESULTS
Of all respondents (n = 21 491), 
16 471 (76.6%) were never smokers 
and 1338 (6.2%) were current 
smokers. Of never smokers, 518 
(3.1%) used e-cigarettes at least 1 
day during the past 30 days and of 
these, 55.6% (288) used flavored 
e-cigarettes. Of current smokers, 724 
(54.1%) used e-cigarettes at least 1 
day during the past 30 days and of 
these and of these, 68.4% (495) used 
flavored e-cigarettes. Overall, 2017 
respondents used e-cigarettes in the 
last 30 days and 1228 (60.9%) of 
them used flavored e-cigarettes.
 
Table 1 presents the prevalence of 
intention to initiate cigarette use 
among never smokers, intention to 
quit tobacco use in next 12 months 
among current smokers, and the 
perception of tobacco’s danger 
among all respondents. Among 
never smokers, the use of flavored 
e-cigarettes was associated with a 
higher prevalence of intention to 
initiate cigarette use compared with 
those who had not used e-cigarettes in 
the past 30 days (58.3% vs 20.1%) or 
with those who had used nonflavored 
e-cigarettes (58.3% vs 47.4%). Among 
youth who reported using flavored 
e-cigarettes, younger students (<15 
vs ≥15 years old) were more likely to 
intend to initiate cigarette use (69.6% 
vs 53.3%), and girls were more likely 
than boys to intend to initiate cigarette 
use (63.8% vs 53.3%). Among current 
smokers, students who reported 
using flavored e-cigarettes were least 
likely to quit tobacco use compared 
with those who reported using 
nonflavored e-cigarettes (24.1% vs 
33.5%) or with those who reported 
not using e-cigarettes (24.1% vs 
32.7%). Among the students who 
reported using flavored e-cigarettes, 
older or high school students were 
less likely to intend to quit tobacco use 
than were younger or middle school 
students. Girls were less likely to 
intend to quit tobacco use than were 
boys, and non-Hispanic blacks were 
less likely to intend to quit tobacco 
use than were other races. Among all 
respondents, students who reported 
using flavored e-cigarettes were least 
likely to perceive tobacco’s danger 
compared with those who reported

DAI and HAO 
using nonflavored e-cigarettes (74.8% 
vs 77.1%) or those who reported not 
using e-cigarettes (74.8% vs 91.3%). 
The low prevalence of perception 
of tobacco’s danger was observed 
among users of flavored e-cigarettes 
across sociodemographic groups and 
current smoking status, especially 
among young students, boys, middle 
schoolers, non-Hispanic blacks, and 
current smokers.
Prediction for the Intention To 
Initiate Cigarette Use Among Never 
Smokers
Factors associated with the intention 
to initiate cigarette use among never 
smokers are presented in  
Table 
2. The use of flavored e-cigarettes 
was associated with higher odds of 
intention to initiate cigarette use 
(aOR = 5.7; P < .0001) compared with 
not using e-cigarettes. Compared with 
users of nonflavored e-cigarettes, 
users of flavored e-cigarettes also had 
higher odds of intention to initiate 
cigarette use (aOR = 1.7; P = .02, not 
shown in  
Table 2). Hispanic students 
were more likely to intend to initiate 
cigarette use than were non-Hispanic 
whites (aOR = 1.7; P < .0001).
Prediction for the Intention To 
Quit Tobacco Use Among Current 
Smokers
Among current smokers, using 
flavored e-cigarettes was associated 
with decreased odds of intention to 
quit tobacco use in the next 12 months 
compared with not using e-cigarettes 
(aOR = 0.6; P = .006) ( 
Table 2). 
In contrast, using nonflavored 
e-cigarettes was not significantly 
associated with decreased odds 
of intention to quit tobacco use 
compared with not using e-cigarettes 
(aOR = 0.9; P = not significant). Other 
social demographic factors were 
not significantly associated with the 
intention to quit tobacco use in the 
multivariate analysis.
Prediction of Perception of 
Tobacco’s Danger
Among all respondents, the students 
who reported using flavored

e-cigarettes had lower odds of 
perceiving tobacco’s danger 
(aOR = 0.5; P < .0001) than those 
who reported not using e-cigarettes 
( 
Table 2). A similar result was 
found for those who reported using 
nonflavored e-cigarettes (aOR = 
0.6; P < .0001). Overall, boys had 
a lower prevalence of perceiving 
tobacco’s danger than did girls 
(aOR = 0.9; P = .01) and non-
Hispanic blacks and Hispanics were 
less likely to perceive tobacco’s 
danger than were non-Hispanic 
whites. Former smokers (aOR = 
0.4; P < .0001) and current smokers 
(aOR = 0.3; P < .0001) were also less 
likely to perceive tobacco’s danger 
than were never smokers.
DISCUSSION
Cigarette smoking is the leading 
cause of preventable death in the 
United States. It is estimated that 
5.6 million youth will die early from 
a cigarette smoking–related illness 
unless youth smoking rates drop 
rapidly. 
20 Although the current use 
of cigarettes among youth has been 
declining, e-cigarette use is gaining 
popularity, with 16.0% of high 
school students and 5.3% of middle 
school students reporting use of 
e-cigarettes in the past 30 days in 
2015. 
1 The majority of youth who 
have ever used e-cigarettes started 
with a flavored product, 
 
2 and >60% 
of current youth e-cigarette users 
report use of a flavored product. 
5 
However, new rules issued by the 
Food and Drug Administration in 
May 2016 to regulate e-cigarettes 
and other tobacco-related products 
do not restrict the sale of candy-
flavored and fruit-flavored 
noncigarette products, including 
flavored e-cigarettes. As the number 
of e-cigarette flavors on the market 
continues to grow, it is important to 
understand how flavored e-cigarette 
use is associated with youth tobacco 
use and perceived harmfulness of 
tobacco products.

The results from the 2015 Monitoring 
the Future survey show that >60% of 
youth reported use of nicotine-free 
flavored e-liquids with flavors like 
cotton candy and gummy bears. 
21 
The effects of nicotine addiction 
and long-term harms of nicotine 
use have been well documented in 
the literature, 
 
20 but the potential 
harm of flavored e-juice remains 
unknown, which might lead to a false 
perception that flavored e-cigarettes 
are less harmful than nonflavored 
ones. Concerns have also been raised 
that e-cigarette makers are using the 
flavorings as a marketing strategy to 
attract young people, because these 
flavored tobacco products are often 
packaged to look like candy and 
are sold next to candy, 
 
22 and thus 
normalize vaping behaviors. 
5,

– 
9 In 
this study, we found that flavored 
e-cigarette use among never-smoking 
youth was associated with higher 
odds of intention to initiate cigarette 
use (aOR = 5.7; P < .0001) compared 
with never-smoking youth who 
reported not using e-cigarettes. 
Compared with users of nonflavored 
e-cigarettes, users of flavored 
e-cigarettes also had higher odds 
of intention to initiate cigarette use 
(aOR = 1.7; P = .02). The intention 
to initiate cigarette use among 
never-smoking youth was especially 
higher among younger students who 
reported use of flavored e-cigarettes 
than among those who reported not 
using e-cigarettes. Consistent with 
previous findings about e-cigarette 
use, 
10 
– 
13 our findings suggest that 
youth use of flavored e-cigarettes 
might serve as a gateway for future 
cigarette use. These findings could 
provide evidence for regulators 
in restricting the sale of flavored 
e-cigarettes.
Some studies show that e-cigarettes 
may help reduce tobacco 
consumption and facilitate tobacco 
abstinence. 
23, 
 
24 However, many 
youths use e-cigarettes for novelty 
and flavors rather than to quit 
smoking. 
25 Our study confirmed 
that current youth smokers who 
reported use of flavored e-cigarettes 
had a significantly lower intention 
to quit tobacco use in the next 
12 months (aOR = 0.6; P = .006) 
compared with those who reported 
not using e-cigarettes. In contrast, 
using nonflavored e-cigarettes was 
not significantly associated with 
decreased odds of intention to quit 
tobacco use. Flavor in e-cigarettes 
is one of the most critical factors in 
the youth vaping experience and can 
make e-cigarette or other tobacco 
product use more addictive for youth. 
A wide range of flavors (ie, fruit, 
dessert, menthol, coffee) have been 
produced to resemble the familiar 
tobacco blends and evoke favorite 
treats and indulgences. A recent 
study showed that flavored tobacco 
products contain similar or even 
higher levels of flavor chemicals as 
compared with candy and Kool-Aid 
drink mix, which allows flavored 
tobacco products to deliver the 
familiar, chemical-specific sensory 
cues that are associated with fruit 
flavors in candy and drink products. 
26 
Furthermore, an experimental 
study showed that flavored 
e-cigarette advertisements were

more appealing than nonflavored 
e-cigarette advertisements and 
elicited greater interest in youth 
to buy and try e-cigarettes.27, 
 
28 
Because flavor is not banned in a 
wide range of noncigarette tobacco 
products, flavored e-cigarette users 
may additionally become dual users 
of other flavored tobacco products. 
All these factors could contribute to 
decreased odds of intention to quit 
tobacco products among flavored 
e-cigarette users.
The overall perception of tobacco’s 
danger was high among adolescents. 
Over 90% of middle and high 
school students agreed or strongly 
agreed that all tobacco products are 
dangerous. After controlling for other 
covariates, we found that flavored 
e-cigarette use was associated 
with lower odds of perceived 
harmfulness of tobacco use (aOR = 
0.5; P < .0001) compared with not 
using e-cigarettes. Past studies have 
found that perceived harmfulness of 
tobacco products is associated with 
increased tobacco use and decreased 
tobacco cessation outcomes. 
20, 
 
29 
– 
31 Health practitioners and school 
administrators should be aware of 
the lower perception of tobacco’s 
danger among users of flavored 
e-cigarettes than among other 
students. Educating youth about the 
danger of tobacco is also warranted 
to increase awareness of the risks of 
using tobacco products and prevent 
youth from smoking.
This study has limitations. First, the 
2014 NYTS data were collected from 
students who attended either public 
or private schools. By excluding 
high school dropouts and home-
schooled students, the school-based 
survey might have sampling bias 
and might not be generalizable to 
all-aged youth. Second, flavored 
e-cigarette use was self-reported. 
Thus, recall biases might have existed 
in this study, especially for younger 
respondents. 
32 Third, flavored 
e-cigarette use was obtained from 
a check-all-that-apply response, 
which might yield lower estimates 
than forced-choice options. Finally, 
the data are cross-sectional; thus, 
we were unable to establish causal 
inferences.
CONCLUSIONS
Despite the limitations described 
above, this study is the first of its 
kind to examine the associations 
between flavored e-cigarette use and 
smoking among youth by analyzing 
a nationally representative sample. 
We found that compared with not 
using e-cigarettes in the past 30 
days, flavored e-cigarette use was 
associated with higher odds of 
intention to initiate cigarette use 
among never-smoking youth, lower 
odds of intention to quit tobacco use 
among current-smoking youth, and 
a lower prevalence of perception 
of tobacco’s danger among users of 
flavored e-cigarettes. Comprehensive 
tobacco control and prevention 
strategies that address flavored 
e-cigarette products are critically 
needed to reduce tobacco use among 
youth.
