IMPORTANCE The safety of the pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria (PERC), an 8-item block
of clinical criteria aimed at ruling out pulmonary embolism (PE), has not been assessed in a
randomized clinical trial.
OBJECTIVE To prospectively validate the safety of a PERC-based strategy to rule out PE.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS A crossover cluster–randomized clinical noninferiority trial in
14 emergency departments in France. Patients with a low gestalt clinical probability of PE
were included from August 2015 to September 2016, and followed up until December 2016.
INTERVENTIONS Each center was randomized for the sequence of intervention periods. In the
PERC period, the diagnosis of PE was excluded with no further testing if all 8 items of the
PERC rule were negative.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was the occurrence of a
thromboembolic event during the 3-month follow-up period that was not initially diagnosed.
The noninferiority margin was set at 1.5%. Secondary end points included the rate of
computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA), median length of stay in the
emergency department, and rate of hospital admission.
RESULTS Among 1916 patients who were cluster-randomized (mean age 44 years, 980 [51%]
women), 962 were assigned to the PERC group and 954 were assigned to the control group.
A total of 1749 patients completed the trial. A PE was diagnosed at initial presentation in 26
patients in the control group (2.7%) vs 14 (1.5%) in the PERC group (difference, 1.3% [95% CI,
−0.1% to 2.7%]; P = .052). One PE (0.1%) was diagnosed during follow-up in the PERC group
vs none in the control group (difference, 0.1% [95% CI, −� to 0.8%]). The proportion of
patients undergoing CTPA in the PERC group vs control group was 13% vs 23% (difference,
−10% [95% CI, −13% to −6%]; P < .001). In the PERC group, rates were significantly reduced
for the median length of emergency department stay (mean reduction, 36 minutes [95% CI,
4 to 68]) and hospital admission (difference, 3.3% [95% CI, 0.1% to 6.6%]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among very low-risk patients with suspected PE,
randomization to a PERC strategy vs conventional strategy did not result in an inferior rate of
thromboembolic events over 3 months. These findings support the safety of PERC for very
low-risk patients presenting to the emergency department.

he diagnostic strategy for pulmonary embolism (PE) in
theemergencydepartment(ED)iswellestablished,with
the evaluation of the clinical probability, followed by
either D-dimer testing or computed tomographic pulmonary
angiography (CTPA).1,2 This pathway is endorsed by Euro-
pean guidelines and is associated with a very low risk of fail-
ure.However,therearegrowingconcernsonthepotentialover-
use of diagnostic tests (especially CTPA) and possible
overdiagnosis of PE.3,4
The pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria (PERC) rule is
an 8-item set of clinical criteria that includes arterial oxygen
saturation (SpO2) of 94% or less, pulse rate of at least 100/min,
patient age of 50 years or older, unilateral leg swelling, he-
moptysis, recent trauma
or surgery, prior PE or
deep venous thrombosis
(DVT), and exogenous es-
trogen use. These criteria
were derived to select
from among patients with
a low clinical probability of PE, that is a population (PERC-
negative patients) with a very low prevalence of PE in whom
the risk-benefit ratio of further testing would be unfavorable
(ie, a prevalence of PE <1.8%).5,6 A meta-analysis of observa-
tional studies reported that the prevalence of PE is less than
1% in PERC-negative patients.7 However, to our knowledge,
no prospective study has yet implemented this rule, and con-
flicting results from European populations have resulted in
PERC-based strategies not being included in most guidelines
or recommendations.1,8
This multicenter noninferiority randomized clinical trial
was conducted to test the hypothesis that the diagnosis of
PE can be safely excluded among ED patients with a low
clinical probability and a PERC score of zero without further
diagnostic testing.
Methods
Study Design
The population and study design of the PROPER trial (PERC
Rule to Exclude Pulmonary Embolism in the Emergency
Deparment) is available in Supplement 1. The design for this
studywasanoninferiority,crossovercluster–randomizedclini-
cal trial aimed at assessing the safety of the PERC-based strat-
egy. Fourteen EDs in France participated in the study for two
6-month periods separated by a 2-month washout period. The
trial recruitment began in August 2015, ended in September
2016, and follow-up ended in December 2016. The study was
approved by Comité de protection des personnes Ile de France
VI–P140913. All patients provided signed informed consent
before inclusion. The reporting of this study followed the
Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) state-
ment extended to cluster randomized trials.9
Patients and Intervention
All patients who presented to the ED with suspicion of a PE
were eligible for enrollment in the study. The inclusion crite-
ria were new-onset presence or worsening of shortness of
breath or chest pain and a low clinical probability of PE, esti-
mated by the treating physician’
s gestalt as an expectation
below 15%. The physician’
s gestalt evaluation consists of an
unstructured impression of the treating physician as to
whether the probability of PE in the patient is low, moderate,
or high. This evaluation has been reported to perform at least
as well as other structured methods.10 Patients were
excluded if they had an obvious etiology to the acute presen-
tation other than PE (eg, pneumothorax or acute coronary
syndrome), an acute severe presentation (hypotension,
SpO2<90%, respiratory distress), a contraindication to CTPA
(impaired renal function with an estimated creatinine clear-
ance <30 mL/min; known allergy to intravenous radio-
opaque contrast), pregnancy, inability to be followed up, or if
they were receiving any anticoagulant therapy.
Each center was randomized to start with a 6-month
control period (usual care), followed by a 6-month interven-
tion period (PERC-based strategy), or in reverse order
(Figure). The unit of randomization was the ED. Random-
ization was computer generated in blocks, using 3 blocks
of 4 and 1 block of 2. For each number of the list (1-14),
the order of exposure to the intervention was randomly
assigned (3 numbers for each order of exposure). Then this
randomization list was combined with the blinded list of
centers previously numbered. The 2 periods were separated
by a 2-month washout period. In the intervention group,
the diagnostic work-up included an initial calculation of
the PERC score. If the PERC score was zero, PE was ruled
out without subsequent testing. If the PERC score was
positive, the usual diagnostic strategy was applied.1 In the
control group, the diagnostic work-up for PE followed
the usual diagnostic strategy—after inclusion and classifica-
tion as low gestalt probability, D-dimer testing was recom-
mended for all patients, followed (if D-dimer–positive) by a
CTPA.1 We used the age-adjusted threshold for D-dimer
interpretation.11 PE was excluded if one of these 2 tests was
negative. A CTPA with emboli was considered positive,
including isolated subsegmental PE. If the CTPA was judged
inconclusive, the patients would undergo further testing
(pulmonary ventilation-perfusion [V
˙/Q
˙ ] scan or lower-leg
Doppler ultrasound).

Key Points
Question Does use of the pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria
(PERC) in emergency department patients with low clinical
probability of pulmonary embolism (PE) safely exclude the
diagnosis of PE?
Findings In this cluster-randomized crossover noninferiority trial
that included 1916 patients with very low clinical probability of PE,
the 3-month risk of a thromboembolic event when using a PERC
strategy compared with a conventional strategy was 0.1% vs 0%, a
difference that met the noninferiority criterion of 1.5%.
Meaning In emergency department patients at very low risk of
PE, the use of a PERC-based strategy did not lead to an inferior
rate of subsequent thromboembolic events.

 Follow-up
All patients were observed for 3 months and interviewed by
phone at the end of this period. They were instructed to
return to the same ED or hospital in case of recurrent or wors-
ening symptoms. A local clinical research assistant checked
any return visit to the ED or admission to the hospital during
the follow-up period. The phone interview was performed
using a structured questionnaire that recorded consultation
with any physician, hospital visit, and change in medication
or imaging study. In case of inability to perform the phone
interview, the patient’
s general practitioner was contacted. In
cases of inability to contact the patient or physician, we
sought any death records from the administrative record of
patient’
s town of birth.
Outcomes
The primary objective of the study was to assess the per-
centage of failure of the diagnostic strategy. The primary
end point was the occurrence of a symptomatic thrombo-
embolic event during the 3-month follow-up period, which
was not diagnosed at the time of the inclusion visit. Second-
ary end points included the proportion of patients investi-
gated with CTPA, the rate of CTPA-related adverse events
requiring therapeutic intervention within 24 hours, length
of stay in the ED, rate of hospital admission or readmission,
onset of anticoagulation regimen, severe hemorrhage in
patients with anticoagulation therapy, and all-cause mortal-
ity at 3 months. An adjudication committee confirmed the
occurrence of all suspected thromboembolic events during
the follow-up period and adjudicated all deaths as to
whether or not they were likely to have been related to a PE.
The adjudication committee was composed of 3 experts
with special interest in hemostasis (a professor of emer-
gency medicine from France, a professor of pneumology
from France, and a professor of emergency medicine from
Switzerland). The 3 experts were independent to the study
and blinded to the strategy allocation.
Sample Size Estimation and Statistical Analysis
The statistical plan and sample size calculation are reported
in Supplement 2. Based on previous diagnostic studies on
PE, we assumed that the primary end point rate in the con-
trol group would be 1.5%.12-14 The noninferiority margin for
the difference of the primary end point between the 2
groups (delta) was set at 1.5%, which meant that the event
rate had to have an upper CI limit of less than 3% in the
intervention group. This 3% threshold corresponds to the
failure rate observed after negative pulmonary angiography
and is the threshold used in other studies.2,11,12 Alpha was
set at 5% and power at 80%, which produced a sample size
of 1624 patients. With an intraclass correlation coefficient of
0.002, an intraperiod correlation of 0.001, and a mean clus-
ter size of 60 patients, the cluster design effect increased
the sample size to 1818. Allowing for 5% nonevaluable
patients, we needed to recruit 1920 patients.
Baseline characteristics of the intention-to-treat (ITT)
population were expressed as number (%) for qualitative
variables, and mean (SD) or median (interquartile range
[IQR]) for quantitative variables, depending on their distri-
bution. The analysis of the primary end point was per-
formed based on the per-protocol population with
follow-up.15 Noninferiority was assessed on the upper
bound of the 1-sided 95% CI of the difference of percentage
of primary end point occurrence (delta). If the upper bound
of the CI of the difference was greater than 1.5%, the nonin-
feriority hypothesis would have been rejected. Clustering

 effect and period and order effect were checked in a second-
ary analysis on the ITT population after replacing missing
data by considering the worst-case scenario. Sixty primary
outcomes were missing among the 1916 patients (3%; 54
patients were lost to follow-up and 6 withdrew). A general-
ized linear mixed model with Poisson distribution was per-
formed, taking into account center as a random effect and
period and strategy-by-period interaction as fixed effects.
The logarithm of the number of patients was included as an
offset term in the model. The P values reported for fixed
effects were based on t tests with the denominator degrees
of freedom specified using Kenward-Roger approximation.
The Dunnett and Gent χ2 test was used to test noninferiority
on the ITT population. The secondary end points were com-
pared under a superiority hypothesis on the ITT population
and using available data. Qualitative variables were com-
pared using the Pearson χ2 test or the Fisher exact test, and
continuous variables were compared using a Wilcoxon rank-
sum test. The prevalence of PE in both groups at baseline
was compared using the Pearson χ2 test.
Because the PERC group included patients with lower
probability of PE compared with the control group, 2 posthoc
sensitivity analyses were performed (one after the exclusion
of 150 very low-risk patients from the PERC group; another
after the addition of 175 simulated patients with no work-up
for PE in the control group), which allowed a comparison
between groups of similar PE clinical probability. All superi-
ority tests were 2-sided and P values of less than .05 were
considered significant. SAS version 9.3 software (SAS Insti-
tute) was used for statistical analyses.
Results
Fifteen EDs were invited to participate in the study (1 of
which declined). The 14 participating EDs recruited 1916
patients during the study period—954 in the control period
group and 962 in the PERC period group (ITT population).
Details on the participating EDs are reported in eTable 1 in
Supplement 3. Patients who were lost to follow-up, withdrew
consent, or had protocol violations were excluded (Figure).
In the control group, 9 patients (0.9%) did not undergo
D-dimer testing, and in the PERC group, 46 PERC-negative
patients (5%) underwent D-dimer testing. The primary
end point was therefore adjudicated in 1749 patients
(per-protocol with follow-up population)—902 in the control
group and 847 in the PERC group. The mean (SD) age was
44 (17) years and 980 (51%) were women. The main base-
line characteristics of patients are summarized in Table 1
and Table 2.
In the PERC group, there were 459 (48%) PERC-negative
patients (Table 2). A PE was diagnosed at the initial visit in 40
(2%) patients overall, 14 (1.5%) in the PERC group vs 26 (2.7%)
in the control group (difference, 1.3% [95% CI, −0.1% to 2.7%];
P = .052). In these 40 patients, 39 PEs were diagnosed using
CTPA in the ED and 1 with V
˙/Q
˙ scan. Six PEs were subsegmen-
tal (1 in the PERC group and 5 in the control group).
There were 5 deaths, which were reviewed by the adju-
dication committee, and none were considered likely to be
linked to a PE. There was 1 thromboembolic event in the
PERC group after 3-month follow-up (0.1%) and none in the
control group. The difference of proportion (delta) between
the 2 groups was therefore 0.1% (1-sided 95% CI, −�% to
0.8%). The only missed pulmonary embolism or failure of
the PERC rule to identify a PE that occurred in this study
was that of a young male with chest pain and no previous
medical history. He was PERC-negative and initially dis-
charged but then seen again the next day with ongoing pain.
When he presented the second time, a D-dimer was checked
and found to be positive followed by a CTPA, interpreted as
inconclusive, with radiological signs consistent with pneu-
monia. The patient was admitted, had lower-limb Doppler
ultrasonography that showed no VTE and then a V
˙/Q
˙ scan
showed subsegmental defects. He was treated with direct

 oral anticoagulation for 6 months and had a normal scan at
follow up after conclusion of therapy.
Overall, a CTPA was performed in 349 cases (18%), of
which 39 were positive for PE. The diagnostic yield of CTPA
for the diagnostic of PE in the ED was therefore 11% across
both groups. Patients in the PERC group were significantly
less frequently investigated by CTPA (129 [13%]) vs 220 (23%)
in the control group (difference, 9.7% [95% CI, 6.1% to 13.2%)
(Table 3). In the PERC group, there was a significant reduc-
tion in median ED length of stay (4 h 36 min [IQR, 3 h 16 min
to 6 h 22 min] vs 5 h 14 min [IQR, 3 h 50 min to 7 h 19 min] in
the control group; P < .001). Hospital admission rates were
13% (121 patients) in the PERC group vs 16% (152 patients) in
the control group (difference, 3.3% [95% CI, 0.1% to 6.6%]).
There was no significant difference in the rate of all-cause
mortality at 3 months (0.3% [3 patients] in the PERC group vs
0.2% [2 patients] in the control group [difference, 0.1% {95%
CI, −0.5% to 0.7%}]; P > .99), in 3-month hospital readmis-
sion rates (4% [43 patients] in the PERC group vs 7% [62
patients] in the control group; P = .051), and there was no
severe hemorrhage or severe adverse events subsequent to
CTPA (0 in both groups). These findings for the secondary
end points were also observed in the per-protocol population
(Table 3). An ITT analysis with a worst-case scenario that
assumed all lost to follow-up patients met the primary end
point resulted in a 0.2% difference in the primary end point
(1-sided 95% CI, −�% to 1.6%; P = .12) (Table 3). In this ITT
population, there was no significant period effect (P = .62)
and the sequence order of the periods was not associated
with a higher risk of pulmonary embolism at 3 months
(P = .64). The intercluster coefficient was 0.019 and the intra-
cluster coefficient was 0.034.
The posthoc sensitivity analyses are presented in the
Supplement 2. The findings of these analyses are that the 2
groups had similar clinical risk of PE (eTable 2 in Supplement
3). The noninferiority hypothesis remained confirmed in the
per-protocol population, and the rate of CTPA was signifi-
cantly reduced in the PERC group (eTable 3 in Supplement 3).
Discussion
In this cluster-randomized trial of very low-risk patients
with suspected PE, randomization to a PERC strategy
vs conventional strategy did not result in an inferior rate
of thromboembolic events over 3 months. In addition, the
PERC strategy was associated with a benefit in terms of re-
duced CTPA use, ED length of stay, and likelihood of initial ad-
mission into hospital.
After initial validation on observational studies in the
United States,5,16 the PERC rule has been challenged in
Europe by 2 studies that reported an unacceptable rate (>5%)
of PERC-negative patients with a PE diagnosis.17,18 One rea-
son for the reported high prevalence of PE among PERC-
negative patients could be the overall higher prevalence of PE
in a European population.19,20 Another reason was that the
authors used a structured score to evaluate the clinical prob-
ability (Wells or Geneva scores), which is made redundant
when the PERC rule is used. One study reported better
results when combining PERC with low gestalt clinical prob-
ability with no false negative of the PERC rule.21 The primary
end point chosen, ie, the presence of PE after formal work up
in the ED, can also explain in part the discrepancies, leading
to a substantial rate of overdiagnosis, with a greater number
of small PEs diagnosed that could be left untreated.3,4,22,23
The end point chosen for the current study was a symp-
tomaticpulmonarythromboembolismat3monthsanddidnot
include the presence of a PE after formal work up in the ED.
This could explain the difference of prevalence of PE de-
scribed in the 2 groups (1.5% in the PERC group vs 2.7% in the
control group; P = .052). The real PE prevalence in the PERC
group may actually have been higher if all patients had under-
gone formal work up with D-dimer testing. It is very likely that
some patients in the PERC group were discharged with a small
untreated PE, which was not symptomatic even at 3-month
follow-up. There was no significant difference in diagnostic
yieldofCTPAforPE(11%inbothgroups).Aincreasedyieldwith
the use of PERC might have been expected as has been re-
ported with other clinical decision rules.24 However in this

 study, the small number of diagnosed PEs may have resulted
in a lack of power to detect significant differences between the
2 groups. In the PERC group, there were fewer initial PEs di-
agnosed than in the usual care group, with little difference be-
tween the 2 groups in clinically significant thromboembolic
events at 3 months. This suggests that PERC may be inferior
at capturing low-risk events such as small subsegmental PE,
with no clinical benefit in diagnosing the missed PEs in the
PERCgroup.Thismayrepresentatolerablerisktopatientsafety
because small subsegmental PE can be left untreated.25 An-
otherpotentialreasonforthelowerrateofPEinthePERCgroup
may be that the 2 groups were not similar in their initial clini-
cal probability of PE. In the posthoc sensitivity analyses with
similar groups, the PE prevalence in the 2 groups was slightly
modified (1.7% in the PERC group vs 2.7% in the control group
inthefirstposthocanalysisand1.5%inthePERCgroupvs2.3%
in the control group in the second posthoc analysis; eTable 4
in Supplement 3). However, this difference was no longer sta-
tistically significant.
Future research could evaluate the economic benefit of
implementing PERC in routine practice. Furthermore, the
safety and benefit of the modified PERC rule for patients
younger than 35 years should be evaluated and compared to
the initial PERC rule.25
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, the observed preva-
lence of PE in patients with a low gestalt probability is very low.
AlthoughthiscategoryshouldincludepatientswithaPEpreva-
lence below 15%, only 26 patients (2.7%) in the control group
were diagnosed with a PE in the ED. This corresponds with an
overestimation of the risk of PE by the clinician’
s gestalt, which
has been described previously.26 The 2.7% prevalence (95% CI,
1.8% to 4.0%) reported here is below that reported in previ-
ous studies.10,21 However, similar PE prevalences for low-risk
patients have also been reported in a recent study (pooled
prevalence in the ED, 3.1% [1.0% in the United States and 4.3%
outside of the United States]).20 Furthermore, among low-
risk patients with chest pain or dyspnea, the reported preva-
lence of PE was 0.9%.26 In a recent large multicenter prospec-
tive study, Penaloza et al reported a prevalence of 4.7% (95%
CI, 3.5% to 6.1%).27 The mean age of the patients was 44 years
in this study, which is younger than in other main studies.11,27
This could partially explain the low prevalence of PE in this
sample. Furthermore, a CTPA was defined as positive if it
showed an isolated subsegmental PE. This could be consid-
ered controversial as these PEs could be left untreated.28
Second,thefailurerateofthediagnosisstrategyinthecon-
trol group was below the estimation, and therefore, the sample
size calculation was not accurate. The 3% maximal failure rate
that has been used in other trials is derived from studies pub-
lished more than 15 years ago.29 Since this percentage is very
large compared to the less than 1% of events rate recently re-
ported, this raises the question of its validity.11,27 Recently, the
Scientific and Standardization Committee of the Interna-
tional Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis published a rec-

 ommendation to decrease the maximal acceptable failure rate
to 2%. With this new recommended threshold, the present re-
sults would still be valid.30
Third, this was not a patient-level randomized trial, there-
fore a bias inherent to the cluster design cannot be excluded.
This shortcoming is however partly limited by the absence of
period and sequence order effects. Fourth, it is possible that
an occult inclusion bias may have been introduced, in which
emergency physicians were willing to discharge PERC-
negative patients with no further testing and therefore did not
include some of these patients in the trial during the control
period. This could not be assessed because data were not re-
corded regarding the number of eligible patients who were not
enrolled. The difference in the rate of PERC-negative patients
and clinical probability of PE between the 2 groups (Table 2)
suggests that physicians could have included more very low-
risk patients in the PERC group, as they were willing to dis-
charge them with no further testing. However, 2 post-hoc sen-
sitivityanalysesconfirmedtheprimaryresultofnoninferiority,
although with smaller effect on the secondary end points.
Fifth, there were 54 patients lost to follow-up and the
presence of a few events among these patients would have
altered the conclusion of this study. A worst-case scenario
simulation would have led to the rejection of the non-
inferiority hypothesis (difference, 0.2% [upper bound of the
95% CI at 1.6% for a margin set at 1.5%]). Sixth, it is pos-
sible that the use of PERC induced diversion of unnecessary
testing, and therefore patients not tested for PE were tested
for another acute condition such as coronary syndrome.
However, these data were not collected for these patients
in this study.
Conclusions
Among very low-risk patients with suspected PE, randomiza-
tion to a PERC strategy vs conventional strategy did not
result in an inferior rate of thromboembolic events over
3 months. These findings support safety of PERC for very
low-risk patients presenting to the emergency department
