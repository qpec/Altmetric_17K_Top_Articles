IMPORTANCE Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder
characterized by loss of upper and lower motor neurons. Although novel ALS genetic variants
have been identified, the shared genetic risk between ALS and other neurodegenerative
disorders remains poorly understood.
OBJECTIVES To examine whether there are common genetic variants that determine the risk
for ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases and to identify their functional pathways.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this study conducted from December 1, 2016, to
August 1, 2017, the genetic overlap between ALS, sporadic frontotemporal dementia (FTD),
FTD with TDP-43 inclusions, Parkinson disease (PD), Alzheimer disease (AD), corticobasal
degeneration (CBD), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) were systematically
investigated in 124 876 cases and controls. No participants were excluded from this study.
Diagnoses were established using consensus criteria.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomes were a list of novel loci and their
functional pathways in ALS, FTD, PSP, and ALS mouse models.
RESULTS Among 124 876 cases and controls, genome-wide conjunction analyses of ALS, FTD,
PD, AD, CBD, and PSP revealed significant genetic overlap between ALS and FTD at known
ALS loci: rs13302855 and rs3849942 (nearest gene, C9orf72; P = .03 for rs13302855 and
P = .005 for rs3849942) and rs4239633 (nearest gene, UNC13A; P = .03). Significant genetic
overlap was also found between ALS and PSP at rs7224296, which tags the MAPT H1
haplotype (nearest gene, NSF; P = .045). Shared risk genes were enriched for pathways
involving neuronal function and development. At a conditional FDR P < .05, 22 novel ALS
polymorphisms were found, including rs538622 (nearest gene, ERGIC1; P = .03 for ALS and
FTD), which modifies BNIP1 expression in human brains (35 of 137 females; mean age, 59
years; P = .001). BNIP1 expression was significantly reduced in spinal cord motor neurons
from patients with ALS (4 controls: mean age, 60.5 years, mean [SE] value, 3984 [760.8]
arbitrary units [AU]; 7 patients with ALS: mean age, 56 years, mean [SE] value, 1999 [274.1]
AU; P = .02), in an ALS mouse model (mean [SE] value, 13.75 [0.09] AU for 2 SOD1 WT mice
and 11.45 [0.03] AU for 2 SOD1 G93A mice; P = .002) and in brains of patients with PSP (80
controls: 39 females; mean age, 82 years, mean [SE] value, 6.8 [0.2] AU; 84 patients with
PSP: 33 females, mean age 74 years, mean [SE] value, 6.8 [0.1] AU; β = –0.19; P = .009) or
FTD (11 controls: 4 females; mean age, 67 years; mean [SE] value, 6.74 [0.05] AU; 17 patients
with FTD: 10 females; mean age, 69 years; mean [SE] value, 6.53 [0.04] AU; P = .005).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study found novel genetic overlap between ALS and
diseases of the FTD spectrum, that the MAPT H1 haplotype confers risk for ALS, and identified
the mitophagy-associated, proapoptotic protein BNIP1 as an ALS risk gene. Together, these
findings suggest that sporadic ALS may represent a selectively pleiotropic, polygenic disorder.

 A
myotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotempo-
ral dementia (FTD) are thought to represent a continu-
ous disease spectrum.1 Clinically, ALS presents as pro-
gressivemusclewasting,hyperreflexia,andspasticity,whereas
FTD is defined by cognitive and behavioral dysfunction. Be-
tween 40% and 50% of patients with ALS present with FTD-
associated clinical phenotypes, including progressive apha-
sia, language impairment, and executive dysfunction.1
Neuropathologically, ALS is defined by the loss of upper and
lower motor neurons and the formation of TDP-43, SOD1, and
ubiquitin-positive inclusions within motor neurons. Fronto-
temporaldementiaisdefinedbyatrophyofthefrontalandtem-
porallobes,andsubtypesofFTDaredistinguishedbythetypes
of inclusions in these regions (tau, FUS, TDP-43, and
ubiquitin).2 Comparatively less is known about the shared
pathobiology between ALS and other neurodegenerative dis-
eases, such as Alzheimer disease (AD), corticobasal degenera-
tion (CBD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and Parkin-
son disease (PD).
Genetic factors offer insights into the molecular mecha-
nisms underlying disease. Rare mutations in TDP43 (Gen-
Bank 3435) are associated with ALS and FTD.3-5 Genetic stud-
ies have revealed expansions of the hexanucleotide repeat
within the noncoding promoter region of C9orf72 (GenBank
203228) as the cause of ALS and FTD.6,7 However, beyond
C9orf72 and TDP43, the genetic overlap across sporadic forms
of ALS, FTD, and other neurodegenerative diseases remains
poorly understood.
One approach to assessing additional genetic risk among
these diseases is to identify single-nucleotide polymor-
phisms (SNPs) that are jointly associated with multiple
traits.8-11 Using previously validated methods, we investi-
gated the genetic overlap between ALS, FTD, PSP, CBD, AD,
and PD. We then used molecular and bioinformatics
approaches to begin to define the role that these shared risk
genes play in neurodegeneration.
Methods
Participant Samples
We evaluated summary statistics (P values and odds ratios)
from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for ALS, PD,
AD, CBD, PSP, sporadic FTD, and autosomal dominant FTD
with TDP-43 inclusions (eTable 1 in the Supplement). The
GWASs were performed for individuals of European descent.
Samples have been previously described in detail.12-18 The
data set on ALS represents 31 independent cohorts of partici-
pants with ALS and control participants.14 Amyotrophic lat-
eral sclerosis was diagnosed as probable or definite accord-
ing to the 1994 El Escorial Criteria by neurologists
specializing in motor neuron diseases.19 The data set on spo-
radic FTD included multiple subtypes within the FTD spec-
trum: behavioral variant FTD, semantic dementia, progres-
sive nonfluent aphasia, and FTD overlapping with motor
neuron disease. The relevant institutional review boards or
ethics committees approved the research protocol of the
individual GWASs used in the present analysis, and all
human participants gave written informed consent. The
Human Research Protection Program Institutional Review
Board at University of California San Francisco waived con-
sent for all participants. The Institutional Review Board
determined that the use or disclosure of the information
does not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the indi-
viduals and involves no more than a minimal risk to their
privacy.
Statistical Analysis
Genetic Enrichment
We applied previously validated statistical methods to assess
shared genetic risk and identify ALS susceptibility loci.9,10,20-22
We evaluated SNPs associated with increased risk for ALS and
FTD, ALS and PD, ALS and AD, ALS and CBD, ALS and PSP, and
ALS and FTD with TDP-43 inclusions. Using this approach, the
genetic enrichment of phenotype A with phenotype B exists
if the proportion of SNPs or genes associated with phenotype
A increases as a function of the increased association with phe-
notype B. To evaluate enrichment, we constructed fold-
enrichment and quantile-quantile plots of nominal –log10
P values for all ALS SNPs and for subsets of SNPs determined
by the significance of their association with PD, AD, CBD, PSP,
and FTD (sporadic FTD and FTD with TDP-43 inclusions) (eFig-
ure 1 in the Supplement). Enrichment can be directly inter-
preted in terms of the true discovery rate, which is equal to
1 minus the false discovery rate (FDR) (eAppendix 1 in the
Supplement).9,10,20-22 To minimize false positives, we used a
100-iteration random pruning with a linkage disequilibrium
(LD) r2 < 0.2.21
Identification of Shared Risk Loci-Conjunction FDR
To identify specific loci jointly shared between ALS and PD,
AD, CBD, PSP, or FTD (sporadic FTD and FTD with TDP-43 in-
clusions), we computed the conjunction FDR.8,9,20,21 The con-
junctionFDRisdefinedastheposteriorprobabilitythatanSNP
is null for either phenotype or for both simultaneously, given
that the P values for both traits are as small, or smaller, than
the P values for each trait individually (eAppendix 1 in the
Supplement).8,9 We used an overall FDR threshold of P < .05
to indicate statistical significance. Manhattan plots were con-
structed based on the ranking of the conjunction FDR to illus-
trate the genomic location of the shared genetic risk loci.
Key Points
Question Are there genome-wide genetic risk factors for
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis that are shared with other
neurodegenerative diseases?
Findings This study of combined genome-wide association data
identified selective genetic overlap between amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis and neurodegenerative diseases within the
frontotemporal dementia spectrum.
Meaning These findings identify common genetic pathways
between amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal
dementia and suggest that MAPT and BNIP1 influence the
pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

 Identification of Novel Risk Loci-Conditional FDR
To identify specific ALS susceptibility loci as a function of ge-
netic variants associated with the 6 neurodegenerative disor-
ders,wecomputedconditionalFDRs.20,21TheconditionalFDR
is an extension of the standard FDR, which incorporates in-
formation from GWAS summary statistics of a second pheno-
type to adjust its significance level. The conditional FDR is de-
finedastheprobabilitythatanSNPisnullinthefirstphenotype
given that the P values in the first and second phenotypes are
as small as or smaller than the observed ones. Ranking SNPs
by the standard FDR or by P values gives the same ordering of
SNPs. In contrast, if the primary and secondary phenotypes
are related genetically, the conditional FDR reorders SNPs and
results in a different ranking than that based on P values alone.
We used an overall FDR threshold of P < .05 to indicate sta-
tistical significance, which means 5 expected false discover-
ies per 100 reported. In addition, we constructed Manhattan
plots based on the ranking of the conditional FDR to illustrate
the genomic location. In all analyses, we controlled for the ef-
fects of genomic inflation by using intergenic SNPs (eAppen-
dix 1 in the Supplement). Detailed information on the condi-
tional FDR can be found in prior reports.20,21
Functional Evaluation of Shared Risk Loci
To determine whether the conjunction and conditional SNPs
shared across ALS, PD, AD, CBD, PSP, and FTD (sporadic FTD
and FTD with TDP-43 inclusions) modify gene expression,
we evaluated cis–expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in a
publicly available data set from neuropathologically con-
firmed control brains (UK Brain Expression Consortium,
http://braineac.org/).23 To minimize multiple comparisons, we
analyzed eQTL for the mean P value derived across the fol-
lowing brain regions: the cerebellum, frontal cortex, hippo-
campus, medulla, occipital cortex, putamen, substantia nigra,
temporalcortex,thalamus,andwhitematter.Tominimizefalse
positives, we applied a Bonferroni-corrected P value of
1.5 × 10−3. To test for association between genotypes and gene
expression, we used an analysis of covariance. We tested SNPs
using an additive model in SAS (SAS Institute Inc). To evalu-
ate cis-acting splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTL), we exam-
ined the associations of our shared risk SNPs with alternative
splicing in control human brains.24 Each study reported ge-
netic and expression data on brains from individuals of Euro-
pean descent.
Differential Expression of Shared Genetic Risk Variants
in Tissues of Patients With ALS, PSP, FTD, AD, or PD
To determine whether shared risk genes identified by the con-
junction FDR, the conditional FDR, and genes in cis-eQTL were
differentially expressed in tissue from patients with ALS com-
pared with controls, we analyzed the gene expression of the
target genes in motor neurons isolated from 11 patients with
ALS and controls (Gene Expression Omnibus [GEO] accession
number GSE833).25 To validate the genes identified in GSE833,
weexaminedexpressiondatafromawell-characterizedmouse
model.26 The RNA expression data were analyzed in nontrans-
genic SOD1 WT and SOD1 G93A mice at 75 and 110 days (GEO
accession number GSE4390).27 SOD1 G93A mice are presymp-
tomatic at 75 days and exhibit hindlimb paralysis at 110
days.26,27
To determine whether differentially expressed genes in
ALS were altered across brains with neurodegenerative dis-
ease,weanalyzedthegeneexpressionofthetargetgenesusing
publicly available data sets. Differential gene expression was
analyzed from the following data sets: the temporal cortices
from patients with PSP and control brains (Synapse ID No.
syn6090802)28 and the frontal, hippocampus, and cerebel-
lum from patients with FTD and controls (GEO accession num-
ber E13162).29 Each data set of control and disease tissue was
obtained from individuals of European descent. All analyses
were performed using analysis of covariance in SAS.
Gene Ontologic Features and Network-Based Functional
Association Analyses
To identify enrichments in gene ontologic features associ-
ated with the ALS, PD, AD, CBD, PSP, and FTD (sporadic FTD
and FTD with TDP-43 inclusions) shared risk genes identified
by the conjunction FDR, the conditional FDR, and genes in cis-
eQTL, we used the Consensus Path Database, which com-
pares gene ontologic terms between background and candi-
date gene sets using the hypergeometric test and generates
P values that are corrected for multiple testing using the
FDR. Gene ontologic analyses were performed using the
Consensus Path Database (Release 31; http://cpdb.molgen
.mpg.de/).30,31Weusedthedefaultbackgroundgeneset,which
includes 18 043 genes. Biological, cellular, and molecular gene
ontologic terms were included in a single analysis.
Results
Selective Shared Genetic Risk Between ALS, PD, AD, CBD,
PSP, and FTD
We identified enrichment in ALS SNPs across different levels
ofsignificancewithFTD,PSP,andCBD(Figure1).Applyingpro-
gressively stringent P value thresholds for ALS SNPs (ie, in-
creasing values of nominal –log10 P value), we found up to 300-
fold enrichment using FTD with TDP-43 inclusions, 150-fold
enrichment using FTD, 75-fold enrichment using PSP, and 25-
fold enrichment using CBD (Figure 1). In contrast, we found
minimal or no enrichment in ALS SNPs as a function of AD or
PD (Figure 1).
At a conjunction FDR P < .05, we identified 5 SNPs that
were jointly associated with increased risk for ALS and FTD
with TDP-43 inclusions, ALS and FTD, or ALS and PSP (Figure 1
and Table 1). These SNPs included the following: (1) rs9820623
(nearest gene, MOBP [GenBank 17433]; FDR ALS and PSP,
P = 4.99 × 10−3); (2) rs13302855 (nearest gene, C9orf72; FDR
ALS and FTD, P = 3.13 × 10−2); (3) rs3849942 (nearest gene,
C9orf72; FDR ALS and FTD with TDP-43 inclusions,
P = 4.88 × 10−3); (4) rs7224296 (nearest gene, NSF [GenBank
4905]; FDR ALS and PSP, P = 4.52 × 10−2); (5) rs4239633 (near-
est gene, UNC13A [GenBank 23025]; FDR ALS and FTD,
P = 3.05 × 10−2).

 Conditional FDR Analysis and Novel Risk Loci
Conditional FDR analysis revealed 29 additional risk loci at an
FDR P < .05 (eFigure 1 and eTable 2 in the Supplement). Sig-
nals at rs3849943, rs10511816, and rs13302855 (nearest gene,
C9orf72;rs3849943:FDRforALSandFTD,P = 5.30 × 10−9,ALS
P = 4.56 × 10−19; rs10511816: FDR for ALS and FTD,
P = 4.97 × 10−9, ALS P = 6.08 × 10−11; rs13302855: FDR for ALS
and FTD, P = 2.03 × 10−4; ALS P = 4.04 × 10−6); rs12608932
(nearest gene, UNC13A; FDR for ALS and FTD, P = 1.04 × 10−6;
ALS P = 1.83 × 10−8); rs1768208 and rs13079368 (nearest gene,
MOBP; rs1768208: FDR for ALS, FTD, and PSP, P = 6.89 × 10−3,
ALS P = 4.04 × 10−5; rs13079368: FDR for ALS, FTD, and PSP,
P = 1.99 × 10−3; ALS P = 4.11 × 10−5); and rs7813314 (nearest
gene, BC045738 [GenBank 101927815]; FDR for ALS and FTD,
P = 4.86 × 10−3; ALS P = 7.78 × 10−7) have been described pre-
viously to be associated with ALS.14 In addition, we identi-
fied 22 additional novel risk SNPs, including rs538622 (near-
est gene, ERGIC1 [GenBank 57222]; FDR for ALS and FTD,
P = 3.07 × 10−2; ALS P = 1.37 × 10−5; eTable 2 in the Supple-
ment). Among these novel risk SNPs, we identified rs7224296
(nearest gene, NSF), which is located on chromosome 17 and
occurs within the 1-megabase (Mb) inversion of the MAPT
(GenBank 4137) haplotype.
eQTL and sQTL
To begin to define the functional effects of these shared
risk SNPs, we evaluated cis-eQTL in human brains free
of neuropathologic characteristics (Table 2). The SNP
rs7224296 near NSF has been previously reported to tag the
MAPT H1 haplotype.9 The MAPT H1 haplotype is associated
with increased risk for FTD, PSP, CBD, AD, and PD.10,11,13,16-18
However, the most significant cis-eQTL with 24296 occurred
with KIAA1267 (GenBank 284058) (also known as KANSL1)
(Table 2). rs7224296 is in high LD with rs199533 (D′ = –0.97),
which was previously reported to be associated with shared
risk for PSP, CBD, and FTD.9 Consistent with previous find-
ings for rs199533,9 rs7224296 is significantly associated with
the altered expression of exon 3 within the MAPT gene
(Table 2). MAPT H1 is associated with decreased expression
of messenger RNA transcripts containing exons 2 and 3,
which results in the 2N tau protein.32 Together, these find-
ings point to an association between the MAPT H1 haplotype
and the risk for ALS.
We also identified 2 SNPs sharing genetic overlap be-
tween ALS and FTD or ALS and FTD with TDP-43 inclusions
near C9orf72: rs13302855 and rs3849942 (Table 1). These SNPs
are not in LD (r2 < 0.02). The SNP rs13302855 produced dis-
tinct eQTL with LRRC19 (GenBank 64922), and rs3849942 pro-
duceddistincteQTLwithMOBKL2B(GenBank79817)(Table2).
Thus, our findings suggest that there are 2 independent sig-
nals within the C9orf72 locus that confer risk. In addition to
cis-eQTL, we examined the association of shared risk SNPs
with sQTL. We found that rs2282241 (nearest gene, C9orf72;
conditional FDR ALS and FTD with TDP-43 inclusions,
P = 3.68 × 10−5; ALS P = 1.55 × 10−7) was significantly associ-
ated with alternative splicing of the C9orf72 gene (alternative
splicing ID, HsaINT0025532; FDR P = 1.08 × 10−3), specifi-
cally intron retention. The sQTL SNP rs2282241 is in high LD
with rs3849942 (D′ = 0.99; Table 1).
Among the novel ALS risk SNPs identified by conditional
FDR analysis, we identified cis-eQTL in human brains (eTable
3 in the Supplement). Most ALS risk SNPs produced cis-eQTL
with genes within the associated locus but not with the near-
est named gene. We found that rs538622, which is associated
with ALS and FTD and falls near the ERGIC1 gene, is signifi-
cantly associated with BNIP1 (GenBank 662) such that the mi-
nor allele (G) is associated with the lower expression of BNIP1
in human brains (P = 1.1 × 10−3).

 Attenuation of Genetic Enrichment After Removing
C9orf72 and MAPT
We identified several SNPs in C9orf72 (on chromosome 9) and
in LD with MAPT (on chromosome 17), suggesting that vari-
ants associated with C9orf72 and MAPT were critical in driv-
ing our enrichment results. To test this hypothesis, we re-
peated our enrichment analysis after removing all SNPs in LD
with r2 > 0.2 within 1 Mb of C9orf72 and MAPT variants (based
on 1000 Genomes Project33 LD structure). After removing
C9orf72 and MAPT SNPs, we observed considerable attenua-
tion of genetic enrichment in ALS as a function of FTD with
TDP-43 inclusions (eFigure 2 in the Supplement). However, we
still found robust enrichment between ALS and PSP (100-fold
enrichment) and sporadic FTD (800-fold enrichment; eFig-
ure 2 in the Supplement), suggesting that the observed over-
lap between ALS and FTD was not driven by the C9orf72 and
MAPT regions.
Shared Genetic Risk Genes Reveal Dysregulation
of Neuronal Networks
To determine whether the shared risk genes fall within
common biological pathways, we used bioinformatics ap-
proaches to identify common pathways. Because most risk
SNPs occur within intergenic regions, we used 2 approaches
to associate a risk SNP with a gene: genes nearest the SNPs and
genes producing eQTL with the SNPs. Pathway analysis re-
veals that shared risk genes, from conjunction and condi-
tional analyses, fall within pathways directly involved in neu-
ronal function: axon guidance, myelin sheath, synaptic vesicle
pathways, neuronal action potential, and regulation of post-
synaptic membrane potential, among others (Table 3; eTables
4 and 5 in the Supplement).
Differential Expression of Shared Risk Genes in Tissues
of Patients With ALS, FTD, PSP, AD, or PD
We next sought to determine whether the risk genes shared
across ALS, FTD, PSP, and CBD were differentially expressed
in disease tissues. To make this determination, we assessed
the differential expression of the genes nearest the top SNP
from conditional and conjunction FDR analyses and of the
genes that produced the strongest eQTL in our functional
analyses in motor neurons isolated from spinal cords of
patients with ALS and controls (genes included in the analy-
sis were taken from Tables 1 and 2 and from eTables 2 and 3
in the Supplement).25 Only 15 genes fitting these criteria
were present in the ALS data set: BNIP1, C20orf24 (GenBank
55969), CAT (GenBank 847), CD59 (GenBank 966), ELL
(GenBank 8178), GPX3 (GenBank 2878), HTRA2 (GenBank
27429), MOBP, MAPT, NFASC (GenBank 114), NSF, SCN5A
(GenBank 6331), TEK (GenBank 7010), TNFAIP1 (GenBank
7126), and TNIP1 (GenBank 10318). We found that BNIP1 was
significantly lower in motor neurons isolated from patients
with ALS compared with controls (Figure 2A; eTable 6 in the
Supplement). MAPT and MOBP were not differentially
expressed in the motor neurons in patients with ALS and
controls (eTable 6 in the Supplement).
Given the genetic overlap, we next examined BNIP1 ex-
pression in the brains of patients with FTD and PSP. Com-
pared with controls, the BNIP1 expression was significantly re-
ducedinthebrainsofpatientswithaneuropathologicdiagnosis
of FTD and PSP (Figure 2B and C). MAPT expression was not
significantly altered in the brains of patients with FTD or PSP
relative to controls (eTable 6 in the Supplement).
To further assess whether BNIP1 expression is associated
with ALS pathologic characteristics, we examined BNIP1 ex-
pression in the spinal cords from a transgenic mouse model
of ALS.26,27 BNIP1 expression was significantly reduced in the
spinal cord of SOD1 G93A mice compared with SOD1 WT mice
(Figure 2G). Thus, BNIP1 expression is associated with ALS
pathologic characteristics.

 Discussion
Using summary statistics from large GWASs (124 876 individu-
als) and established genetic methods, we investigated the ge-
netic overlap between ALS, FTD (sporadic FTD and FTD with
TDP-43inclusions),PD,AD,CBD,andPSP.AtaconjunctionFDR
of P < .05, we identified up to 300-fold enrichment in genetic
risk for ALS across different levels of significance for FTD and
PSP. Conjunction FDR analyses revealed shared loci previ-
ously associated with ALS risk as well as several loci not pre-
viously implicated in disease risk but that point to genetic driv-
ers of neuronal function and mitophagy. Using this approach,
we report novel genetic overlap between ALS and diseases of
the FTD spectrum within the MAPT H1 haplotype.
We observed multiple signals within chromosome 9 that
were associated with risk between ALS and FTD (the cohort
definedbyTDP-43pathologiccharacteristics)andALSandPSP.
Among these, rs3849942 is associated with C9orf72 repeat ex-
pansions that cause ALS and is used as a surrogate marker for
the C9orf72 expansion haplotype.34-36 Consistent with these
reports, our sQTL findings suggest that SNPs in LD with
rs3849942 modify C9orf72 splicing. Thus, it is likely that
C9orf72expansioncarriersarepresentinmultipledatasetsand
are driving some of the association. However, given that
rs3849942isnotinLDwithasecondSNPnearC9orf72,302855,
we may be detecting an independent signal on chromosome
9 that is associated with the risk for ALS, FTD, and PSP.
Mutations in MAPT cause autosomal dominant forms of
FTD.37 Among FTD, PSP, and CBD, common variants in MAPT
that tag the H1 haplotype represent the strongest genetic pre-
dictor of disease.10,11,13,16-18 In addition, the MAPT H1 haplo-
type has been associated with PD and AD.10,11,13,16-18 The MAPT
H1haplotypehasrecentlybeenimplicatedinALSriskinameta-
analysis of publications on neurodegenerative disease.38 The
risk SNP tagging the MAPT H1 haplotype, rs7224296, is asso-
ciated with altered splicing of MAPT of exon 3, which, to-
gether with exon 2, encodes 2N-containing transcripts. Al-
thoughtherolethatindividualMAPTtranscriptsplayinnormal
physiology and disease remains poorly understood, a recent
study of human-induced pluripotent stem cell–derived neu-
rons from MAPT haplotype carriers suggests that the H1 hap-
lotype influences axonal transport velocities.39 In ALS, these
potential gene-induced deficits in axonal transport could al-
ter disease onset and/or progression.
Conditional FDR analyses offer the opportunity to begin to
reveal novel ALS risk loci. Using this approach, we identified 29
SNPsataconditionalFDRofP < .05.Withinchromosome5,we
identified a risk locus at rs538622 (nearest gene, ERGIC1) that
producedasignificanteQTLinhumanbrainswithBNIP1.BNIP1
is a proapoptotic protein (Bcl-2 family member) involved
in the regulation of endoplasmic reticulum structure and
mitophagy.40,41 BNIP1 is highly expressed in neurons (eFigure
3 in the Supplement). More important, we demonstrate that
BNIP1 is significantly lower in central nervous system tissues
frompatientswithALS,FTD,andPSP.Becauseneuronalcellloss
is a hallmark feature of neurodegenerative disease and be-
cause BNIP1 is a neuronally expressed gene, we find that BNIP1
is specifically reduced in both motor neurons isolated from the
spinalcordsofpatientswithALScomparedwiththemotorneu-

 rons from matched controls. BNIP1 plays a critical role in mi-
tophagy, a homeostatic mechanism for the selective degrada-
tion of damaged mitochondria.42 Depletion of BNIP1 in a cell
model results in the disintegration of the endoplasmic reticu-
lumnetwork.41Giventhatendoplasmicreticulumstressandmi-
tochondrial dysfunction have been implicated in ALS at the ge-
netic, molecular, and cellular levels,43 BNIP1 may represent an
important driver of pathologic characteristics.44-46 Altered en-
doplasmicreticulumstressandmitochondrialdysfunctionhave
been implicated in PSP and FTD.47-52 The MAPT H1 haplotype
has been shown to alter the axonal transport velocities of mi-
tochondria, providing a biological connection to 2 of our most
interesting genetic signals.39
Functionally, beyond mitophagy, we observed enrich-
ment in shared risk genes occurring in pathways involved in
neuronal health and maintenance. This finding, taken to-
gether with the relative lack of enrichment of genes in ALS, AD,
andPD,pointstotheimportantrolethatgenesinvolvedinneu-
ronal heath and function play in driving ALS, FTD, and PSP.
Together, this study provides genetic, molecular, and func-
tional insights into the effects of risk variants shared across the
ALS-FTD spectrum.
Limitations
Beyond BNIP1, by leveraging statistical power from large
neurodegenerative GWASs, we identified numerous novel
ALS genetic variants. Although these SNPs warrant replica-
tion in an independent cohort, our findings suggest that spo-
radic ALS may represent a polygenic disorder characterized
by numerous genetic variants, each of which has a small
association with disease risk. Although no single common
variant may be informative clinically, the additive combina-
tion of risk variants may help identify individuals who are at
greatest genetic risk for ALS. The GWASs used in these analy-
ses were performed for participants of European decent;
thus, our findings of the genetic architecture of ALS and FTD
spectrum disorders may be biased for individuals of Euro-
pean decent. Future studies conducted in large non-
European populations will be critical for gaining a more
complete understanding of the genetic architecture underly-
ing ALS and FTD spectrum disorders.
Conclusions
By integrating GWAS data with gene expression data from
neurodegenerative disease and transgenic mouse models, our
multimodal findings implicate the MAPT H1 haplotype in ALS
and BNIP1 in the ALS-FTD spectrum. Additional work will be
required to understand the role that tau plays in ALS and the
relationship between BNIP1, mitophagy, and neurodegenera-
tive diseases.
