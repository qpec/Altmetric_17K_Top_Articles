Summary
Because people age differently, age is not a sufficient marker of
susceptibility to disabilities, morbidities, and mortality. We
measured nineteen blood biomarkers that include constituents
of standard hematological measures, lipid biomarkers, and
markers of inflammation and frailty in 4704 participants of the
Long Life Family Study (LLFS), age range 30–110 years, and used
an agglomerative algorithm to group LLFS participants into
clusters thus yielding 26 different biomarker signatures. To test
whether these signatures were associated with differences in
biological aging, we correlated them with longitudinal changes
in physiological functions and incident risk of cancer, cardiovas-
cular disease, type 2 diabetes, and mortality using longitudinal
data collected in the LLFS. Signature 2 was associated with
significantly lower mortality, morbidity, and better physical
function relative to the most common biomarker signature in
LLFS, while nine other signatures were associated with less
successful aging, characterized by higher risks for frailty, mor-
bidity, and mortality. The predictive values of seven signatures
were replicated in an independent data set from the Framingham
Heart Study with comparable significant effects, and an addi-
tional three signatures showed consistent effects. This analysis
shows that various biomarker signatures exist, and their signif-
icant associations with physical function, morbidity, and mortal-
ity suggest that these patterns represent differences in biological
aging. The signatures show that dysregulation of a single
biomarker can change with patterns of other biomarkers, and
age-related changes of individual biomarkers alone do not
necessarily indicate disease or functional decline.

Introduction
The steady increase in human average life expectancy in the 20th
century is considered one of the greatest accomplishments of public
health. Improved life expectancy has also led to a steady growth in
the population of older people, age-related illnesses and disabilities,
and consequently the need for prevention strategies and interventions
that promote healthy aging. A challenge in assessing the effect of
such interventions is ‘what to measure’. Chronological age is not a
sufficient marker of an individual’s functional status and susceptibility
to aging-related diseases and disabilities. As has been said many times
by Gerontologists and Geriatricians, people can age very differently
from one another. Individual biomarkers show promise in capturing
specificity of biological aging (Karasik et al., 2005), and the scientific
literature is rich in examples of biomarkers that correlate with physical
function, anabolic response, and immune aging (Gruenewald et al.,
2006; Walston et al., 2006; Stenholm et al., 2010; Banerjee et al.,
2011;
Franceschi
&
Campisi,
2014;
B€
urkle
et al.,
2015;
Cohen
et al., 2015; Catera et al., 2016; Peterson et al., 2016). However,
single biomarker correlations with complex phenotypes that have
numerous and complex underlying mechanisms is limited by poor
specificity.
Moving from a simple approach based on one biomarker at a time to
a systems analysis approach that simultaneously integrates multiple
biological markers provides an opportunity to identify comprehensive
biomarker signatures of aging (Zierer et al., 2015). Analogous to this
approach, molecular signatures of gene expression have been correlated
with age and survival (Kerber et al., 2009; Passtoors et al., 2013), and a
regression model based on gene expression predicts chronological age
with substantial accuracy, although differences between predicted and
attained age could be attributed to some aging-related diseases (Peters
et al., 2015). The well-known DNA methylation clock developed by
Horvath has been argued to predict chronological age (Horvath, 2013).
Alternative approaches that aggregate the individual effects of multiple
biological and physiological markers into an ‘aging score’ have also been
proposed (MacDonald et al., 2004; Levine, 2013; Sanders et al., 2014;
Belsky et al., 2015; Peterson et al., 2016). These various aging scores do
not attempt to capture the heterogeneity of aging. In addition, many of
these aging scores use combinations of molecular and phenotypic
markers and do not distinguish between the effects and the causes of
aging (Newman, 2015).
Here we propose a system-type analysis of 19 circulating biomarkers
to discover different biological signatures of aging. The biomarkers were
selected based upon their noted quantitative change with age and
specificity for inflammatory, hematological, metabolic, hormonal, or
kidney functions. The intuition of the approach is that in a sample
of individuals of different ages, there will be an ‘average distribution’ of
these circulating biomarkers that represents a prototypical signature of
average aging. Additional signatures of biomarkers that may correlate to
varying aging patterns, for example, disease-free aging, or aging with
increased risk for diabetes or cardiovascular disease (CVD), will be
characterized by a departure of subsets of the circulating biomarkers
from the average distribution. We implemented this approach using data
from the Long Life Family Study (LLFS), a longitudinal family-based study
of healthy aging and longevity that enrolled individuals with ages
ranging between 30 and 110 years (Newman et al., 2011; Sebastiani

discovered in LLFS using data from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS).

Results
The LLFS is a family-based study that enrolled 4935 participants including
probands and siblings (30%), their offspring (50%), and spouses (20%),
with ages between 30 and 110 years (Newman et al., 2011). Approx-
imately 40% of enrolled participants were born before 1935 and had a
median age at enrollment of 90 years and 45% participants were male
(Fig. S2). Almost 55% of participants from the proband generation (birth
year < 1935) have died since enrollment, with a median age at death of
96 years. Mortality in the generation born after 1935 is lower (3%) and
among these few that have died, median age at death is currently
69 years. Table S1 (Supporting information) describes participants’
characteristics.
Generation of biomarker signatures in LLFS
Approximately 40 serum biomarkers were measured at enrollment in
4704 LLFS participants, and the quality and distribution of these
biomarkers
has
been
characterized
elsewhere
(Sebastiani
et al.,
2016b). After removal of biomarkers that did not change with age,
age and sex standardized values of 19 uncorrelated biomarkers (Table 1)
were analyzed with an agglomerative cluster analysis that identified 26
significant clusters of LLFS participants (P < 0.004, Fig. S3). Seventeen of
these clusters had at least 10 individuals, and only eight clusters had
more than 40 individuals. Means and standard deviations of the 19
biomarkers in each cluster defined the 26 biomarker signatures that are
depicted in Table S2 (Supporting information). The dependency of
clusters on all 19 biomarkers was tested by ‘leave one-biomarker-out’
replication (Supporting information and Table S3).
Figure 1 shows the distribution of the 19 biomarkers in the six largest
clusters, and the complete description of the 26 clusters is in Figs S5–
S17. In each plot in Fig. 1, the horizontal line at 0 represents the value of
standardized biomarkers expected for an individual age and sex group.
We designate the biomarker signature associated with cluster 1 as the
‘referent signature’ which is characterized by age and sex standardized
biomarkers symmetrically distributed around 0. On average, all biomark-
ers of the individuals allocated to this cluster would match the values
expected for their age and sex group. Note, however, that unstandard-
ized values change with age and sex, as shown in Fig. 2 for IL-6 and CRP,
and Fig. S18a–p for all 19 biomarkers. Cluster 1 included 37% of
participants born < 1935 (n = 837), with median age 90 years, and
54% females. Cluster 2 included 1128 LLFS participants who were
slightly older than participants in cluster 1 (41% born < 1935; median
age at enrollment 91 years, and 59% born ≥ 1935, median age at
enrollment 61 years) and with a higher rate of females (55%). The
signature associated with the second cluster was characterized by lower
than average creatinine and cystatin values, lower than average
biomarkers of inflammation, and elevated albumin suggesting that
individuals in this cluster had lower than average inflammation and
better than average kidney function for all ages. Cluster 3 included 387
individuals with noticeably low IGF1, and DHEA, and elevated sex
hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and markers of inflammation, with an
overall signature of poor physical function. Clusters 5 and 6 had similar
patterns of biomarkers with the exception of NT-proBNP, HbA1C,
adiponectin, and SHBG. Other clusters were characterized by more
substantial variations of biomarkers but smaller sample sizes. Table S4
(Supporting information) summarizes participants’ demographics by all
cluster.
Annotation of biomarker signatures in LLFS by their
predictive values
To test whether the biomarker signatures for clusters with 10 or more
individuals correspond to different patterns of biological aging, we
correlated them with longitudinal changes in physiological functions and
incident risk of cancer, CVD, type 2 diabetes, and mortality. Figure 3 and
Table S5 (Supporting information) summarize the results of the analysis
that compared participants in cluster 1 (n = 2262) with the other clusters
in terms of aging phenotypes measured at enrollment and at the second
visit (approximately 8 years apart). The analysis showed that the
different signatures are characterized by significant variations in impor-
tant physiological markers of aging that include grip strength (signifi-
cantly worst in cluster 3 compared to cluster 1), gait speed (significantly
slower in clusters 3, 5, and 14 compared to cluster 1), FEV1 (significantly
worse in clusters 3, 5, 7, and 14 compared to cluster 1), cognitive
functions (significantly worse in cluster 5 compared to cluster 1), and
pulse pressure (significantly higher in clusters 5, 6, and 11 compared to
cluster 1). Participants in the 2nd cluster were characterized by a faster
gait speed, higher FEV1, better cognitive scores, and lower pulse rate
compared to the referent cluster. The difference in FEV1 was statistically
significant (Bonferroni corrected significance 0.004), while the signifi-
cance level for the other markers did not pass correction for multiple
comparisons. No substantially significant interactions between age and
clusters were found suggesting that physiological advantages or
disadvantages remained constant over the past 8 years. However, this
result may change as more data are collected and power to detect
significant interactions increases.

 proportional hazard model stratified by sex and adjusted for age at
enrollment. Several signatures showed significantly different hazards for
mortality and morbidity compared to the referent group. Consistent with
the favorable signature of lower inflammation and better kidney
function, subjects in cluster 2 were characterized by significantly lower
risk for type 2 diabetes and overall mortality compared to participants in
cluster 1, while all other clusters were characterized by significantly
higher risk for mortality, or aging-related diseases including cancer, CVD,
and type 2 diabetes. Participants in cluster 2 had a significantly lower
BMI compared to participants in cluster 1 (average BMI difference
�1.54, 95% CI: �1.82; �1.257), while participants in cluster 6 had a
significantly higher BMI compared to cluster 1 (average BMI difference
2.87, 95% CI: 2.32; 3.47). Some of the smaller clusters had a limited
number of events, so the results are less reliable. Note that 200 of 330
CVD events were a ‘first time event’, and 289 of these events were not
preceded by type 2 diabetes.
Calibration of biomarker data in Framingham Heart Study
Our goals with the FHS data were (i) to verify whether the age-sex
distributions of biomarkers in the LLFS were similar to those observed in
the LLFS, (ii) to use the biomarker data available in the FHS to predict
Fig. 1 Six signatures of 19 biomarkers. Side-by-side boxplots display the distributions of the 19 standardized biomarkers in LLFS participants allocated to each cluster.
Biomarkers are grouped and colored by function (salmon: inflammation; green: anemia; blue: diabetes; red: lipid; cyan: endocrine; magenta: renal). In each plot, the
horizontal line at 0 represents the expected values of the standardized biomarkers, and hence, the value of biomarkers expected for specific age and sex groups. Note that
the unstandardized values change with age. For example, the expected value of albumin and hemoglobin for a male aged between 60 and 65 years would be 4.2 g dL�1
and 15 mg L�1, respectively, while the expected value of albumin and hemoglobin for a male aged between 80 and 85 years would be 3.9 g dL�1 and 14.5 mg L�1,
respectively (Fig. S2). LLFS, Long Life Family Study.

 their biomarker signatures, and (iii) to use these predicted signatures to
validate their association with morbidity and mortality in FHS. Limited
subsets of biomarkers were available in the three FHS cohorts, and the
most complete subset was from the offspring generation with 12
biomarkers measured at exam 7 and WBC measured at exam 2 that we
used as a proxy of the measurement at exam 7 (Table S6). Analysis of
one biomarker at a time showed that some markers of inflammation
[high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), NT-proBNP, IL-6, WBC],
diabetes (IGF1, HBA1C, SRAGE), endocrine functions (SHBGE), and
kidney function in men (Albumin) had significantly different distributions
in age groups after adjusting for laboratory-specific effects (Table S7 and
Fig. S19). To remove laboratory-specific effects, calibration of the
biomarkers in the FHS was performed for the FHS original and offspring
generations as described in the Appendix S1, and histograms of the
externally standardized biomarker data in FHS in Fig. S20 show that all
biomarkers had been calibrated successfully.
Validation of predictive values of biomarker signatures in FHS
The next step was to develop a classification model and use it to assign
one of the 26 biomarker signatures discovered in LLFS to each FHS
participant, based on their biomarker profile. To this end, we trained a
Bayesian classifier in LLFS data to predict the biomarker signatures of FHS
participants, and we evaluated sensitivity and positive predictive values
(PPV) when incomplete biomarker data are used for the prediction.
Tables S8 and S9 (Supporting information) show the sensitivity and %
PPV of the classifier in the LLFS data. Notwithstanding the challenge of a
26-label classification, the sensitivity ranging between 36% and 100%
was substantially higher than a random classification of 26 labels which
yields a sensitivity of 3% (Table S8). The %PPV rate was also above 50%
for 14 of the 26 clusters, and above 30% for 22 of 26 clusters (Table S9).
The PPVs of clusters 9 and 17 were lower, suggesting that results
associated with these clusters may not be reliable. Both sensitivity and %
PPV were also tested using the subsets of the biomarkers available in the
original and offspring generations of the FHS (Tables S10 and S11). With
just the eight biomarkers available in the FHS original generation, the
%PPV decreased substantially, while maintaining acceptable values
(%PPV > 25%) with the 13 biomarkers used in the FHS offspring
generation.
When the classifier trained with LLFS data was applied to FHS
standardized data, it predicted the most likely biomarker signature of
each FHS participant. The distribution of these predicted signatures in

 FHS participants from the offspring generation was substantially
different from LLFS, and particularly, the signature associated with
healthier aging (cluster 2) was less common in FHS participants
(Fig. S21). In both FHS generations, the incident risk for mortality,
CVD, and diabetes of participants with signatures 2 through 26 was
compared to the referent group (signature 1). Table 3 reports the
analysis of risk for mortality in the FHS offspring for the nine clusters that
had a significantly different hazard for mortality compared to the
referent cluster in LLFS, while the complete set of results is in Table S12.
Six of the nine clusters replicated the significantly different hazard for
mortality relative to the referent cluster, with the same effects seen in
LLFS. The other three clusters had increased risk for mortality but failed
to reach statistical significance. Noticeably, FHS offspring with signature
2 also had a reduced risk for mortality compared to the referent group,
confirming the favorable effect of a signature combining lower than
average inflammation and better than average kidney functions. The
reduced risk for mortality associated with signature 2 and the increased
risk for mortality of signature 14 were also replicated in FHS participants
of the original cohort (Cluster 2: HR = 0.64, P < E10�4, Cluster 14:
HR = 1.05, P-value 0.007). The increased risk for CVD of signature 5 was
replicated in the offspring generation, and the reduced risk for type 2
diabetes of signature 2 and the increased risk for type 2 diabetes of
signature 6 were replicated in both original and offspring generations
(Table 4 and Table S13 and S14).
Discussion
We used an agnostic data-driven cluster analysis to identify 26 signatures
of 19 blood biomarkers associated with important aging-related
physiological functions summarized in Table 1. To demonstrate that
these signatures are associated with differences in biological aging, we
analyzed their ability to predict changes in physical and cognitive
function, survival, and risk of age-related diseases, including cancer,
cardiovascular events, and type 2 diabetes. We showed that 10 of these
signatures predict different risks of morbidity and mortality in LLFS
participants and we identified one signature that is associated with
healthy aging, as characterized by better physical and cognitive function,
and reduced risk for mortality and morbidity. The risk prediction of 7 of
the 10 signatures was replicated in an independent set of participants
from the FHS with consistent effects. Our analysis shows that various

cluster 1, while bars below 0 represent decreased effects relative to cluster 1. For example, participants in cluster 2 have better gait speed, FEV1, DSST and MSE, and slower
pulse rate compared to cluster 1, although only the difference of FEV1 remains significant after Bonferroni correction. Participants in cluster 5 have significantly slower gait

 signatures of 19 circulating biomarkers exist, and their significant
associations with function, morbidity, and mortality suggest that these
patterns represent differences in biological aging.
While prediction of the risk for morbidity and mortality was used to
demonstrate that different biomarker signatures are linked to different
trajectories of aging-related function, morbidity, and mortality, the goal
of our analysis was not to discover another risk score of aging-related
diseases. Many scores have already been described and work well in an
epidemiological setting, for example, the physiological index of comor-
bidities (Newman et al., 2008; Newman & Murabito, 2013), the Healthy
Aging Index that was developed with LLFS data (Sanders et al., 2014), or
the well-known Framingham Risk Score (Wilson et al., 1998) and its
modifications (Tsao & Vasan, 2015). Our hypothesis was that patterns of
departures from the ‘average age trajectories’ of many circulating
biomarkers may be linked to differences in biological aging that are
characterized by worsened or improved physical and cognitive functions,
morbidity, and mortality. Validating the hypothesis, our analysis discov-
ered various signatures of circulating biomarkers that were significantly
associated with different risk for disease and death, and varying physical
and cognitive functions. Importantly, this hypothesis contrasts with the
view that the biological profile of older, but healthy individuals should be
indistinguishable from that of younger healthy people (Huemer, 1977), a
tenant that is the basis of ‘anti-aging’ and ‘orthomolecular medicine’.
We have previously shown (Sebastiani et al., 2016a) that the distribu-
tions of the 19 biomarkers change with age in a subset of healthy LLFS
participants, and the current analysis provides additional compelling
evidence that some age-related changes in the distribution of biomark-
ers do not necessarily represent disease. For example, the referent
signature associated with cluster 1 captures these average age-related
changes (see hsCRP and IL-6 in Figs 2 and S18a) and is associated with
lower risk for morbidity and mortality than the majority of the other
signatures. Signature 2 was associated with better physical and cognitive
functions, and lower risks for mortality and type 2 diabetes than the
referent signature. Interestingly, levels of markers of inflammation of
individuals sharing this signature tended to be higher with older age, but
they were lower in all age groups compared to the referent group
(Fig. 2, top panel, and Fig. S18b). These results are consistent with some
of the data shown in (Belsky et al., 2015) that emphasize the need to
study aging in younger in addition to older individuals to identify markers
of healthy and unhealthy aging.
An important characteristic of these biomarker signatures of ‘biolog-
ical aging’ is that they are only based on molecular data and do not
include any expressed aging-related phenotype. Investigators have
proposed mathematical models to compute the biological age of an
individual that use molecular data together with physiological pheno-
types such as forced expiratory volume (FEV1), body mass index (BMI),

Replication of the risk for mortality relative to the referent group (cluster 1) in the offspring generation of the FHS. Hazard ratios (HR) were estimated using Cox proportional
hazard regression and adjusted by age at blood collection and stratified by sex. Significance is based on P-values from Wald’s test. %PPV denotes the proportion of positive
predicted values of each signature selected by the Bayesian classifier trained in the LLFS data. The column denoted by ‘%?C1’ denotes the proportion of profiles assigned to

 grip strength, and systolic blood pressure (Levine, 2013; Belsky et al.,
2015). While the inclusion of these expressed phenotypes may improve
prediction of morbidity and mortality because changes of these
expressed phenotypes may be closer in time to onset of morbidity and
mortality, signatures based exclusively on molecular data could capture
earlier departure from the normal healthy aging trajectory and suggest
the need for early interventions before phenotypic symptoms appear.
The graphical display of signatures (Fig. 1) underscores the impor-
tance of a system-type approach to assess the clinical implications of
altered or dysregulated expression of multiple biomarkers. Our analysis
shows that the effect of the dysregulation of a single biomarker changes
with varying patterns of other biomarkers. For example, the morbidity
and mortality risk associated with elevated hsCRP changes with different
patterns of NT-proBNP and HBA1C (signatures 5 and 6 in Fig. 1). The
modeling approach we used, based on clustering, is designed to capture
this type of interdependence that would be difficult to describe using
standard regression modeling. Such complexity also makes sense given
the many different biological mechanisms and their determinants that
underlie aging and its many different trajectories (Lopez-Otin et al.,
2016). Other system-type approaches have been proposed to capture
the complexity of biological aging (Zierer et al., 2015). Li et al. used a
multisystem approach to model 6 predefined physiological systems and
to generate dysregulation scores that correlate with age and predict
morbidity and mortality (Li et al., 2015). Collino et al. (Collino et al.,
2013) discovered metabolic signatures that can discriminate between
different age groups. While these and other analyses showed interesting
features of aging, they did not discover different patterns of aging
affected by multiple systems simultaneously. Our analysis shows that
specific groups of people share specific biomarker signatures that
implicate clinical and biological conditions. In the LLFS data, we found 26
such signatures of biomarkers among a group of individuals who are
generally aging well and are possibly enriched for genetic and
nongenetic factors that promote longevity (Sebastiani et al., 2009,
2013; Newman et al., 2011).
It is possible that the biomarker signatures discovered in the LLFS are
biased toward healthy agers and that we may have missed important
biomarkers that correlate with less successful aging. These signatures
reproduced well in the offspring cohort of the FHS (Fig. S22a–g), but
their distribution in FHS participants was different (Fig. S21) and was
characterized by higher prevalence of signatures associated with higher
risk for mortality and morbidity. In fact, the FHS did not enroll
participants based on longevity or healthy aging and may be considered
as a more generalizable sample of aging individuals compared to the
LLFS. Noticeably, the FHS has been used to study the genetic and
epidemiology of aging-related diseases with results that have been
replicated in numerous other studies. Therefore, the validation of some
of the associations of the biomarker signature with morbidity and
mortality in the FHS is an important strength of this work (Tsao & Vasan,
2015). We expect that similar analyses in other and larger samples of
aging individuals may discover many more signatures that capture
additional types of biological aging.
In addition to elucidating different patterns of aging, the signatures
we discovered have a potential utility in clinical trials, testing treatments,
and nonpharmacological strategies that promote healthy aging or
reduce the risk for aging-related diseases. The predictive values of some
of the biomarker signatures suggest that they could become an efficient
way to assess the effect of interventions but also a more organic means
of simultaneously assessing efficacy and safety of new treatments. Also,
biomarker signatures assessed over time will likely detect target-related
outcomes both preclinically and earlier when efficacy for age-related
diseases needs to be demonstrated. If these analyses replicate in larger
cohorts, biomarker signatures could be used for patient stratification in
the design and analysis of clinical trials and go beyond studies to become
tools for early preclinical diagnoses and more efficacious patient
treatment in clinical settings.
The selection of biomarkers to be measured in LLFS was based on
known or putative roles of the biomarkers in aging and related diseases,
and many of these biomarkers have been shown to change differentially
in normally aging and healthy aging individuals (Newman et al., 2016).
By design, there are no ‘surprising’ biomarkers in our signatures because
we did not conduct molecular-wide analyses to discover novel aging-
related biomarkers. An addition limitation of this analysis is that many
biomarkers of inflammation such as CMV (Wang et al., 2010) that were
shown to be important in the calculation of biological aging in (Levine,
2013), or several markers of inflammaging or immunosenescence
(Franceschi & Campisi, 2014) have not yet been measured in the LLFS.
We expect that many more biomarkers exist that could lead to even
more powerful results, and as costs for measuring and processing
proteomics data become more approachable and the technology more
reliable, these analyses will be very informative. The approach we have

Hazard ratios (HR) relative to the referent signature of cluster 1 were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression, adjusted by age at examination in 7 FHS, and
stratified by sex. Significance is based on P-values from Wald’s test. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) in FHS was defined as myocardial infarction, coronary insufficiency, and
congestive heart failure.

 used is applicable to high-throughput data, although large sample sizes
will be needed for reliable results.
Rarely do studies of biomarkers use independent data to replicate the
findings. In this study, we validated the predictive value of the biomarker
signatures in an independent set. Although the validation is suggestive,
the lack of complete biomarker data in the FHS (FHS had 13 of the 19
biomarkers) was a limitation, and we had to resort to a proxy
measurement of WBC obtained at younger age to avoid loss of
specificity. In addition, we are unable to verify whether the signatures
predicted by the Bayesian classification rules in the FHS data are valid.
The graphical displays of the clusters associated with different inferred
signatures suggest the results are correct (Fig. S22a–g), but a definite
answer will be provided by a replication with more complete biomarker
data.
Our analyses did not attempt to explain why subsets of individuals age
more healthily than others, and we hypothesize that both genetic and
nongenetic factors contribute to different aging patterns captured by
the different biomarker signatures. This work sets the stage for a
molecular-based definition of aging that leverages information from
multiple circulating biomarkers to generate signatures associated with
different mortality and morbidity risk, and additional work is needed to
better characterize these signatures. Application of the proposed
approach to larger studies and a larger number of biomarkers will
extend the current set of biomarker signatures and possibly discover new
ones, and we expect that these biomarker signatures will become a
potent investigative, diagnostic, and prognostic tool.
Experimental procedures
A more detailed description of study samples, data and statistical
methods is in Supporting information. Figure S1 (Supporting informa-
tion) summarizes the analysis process.
Study populations and study design
The LLFS is a family-based, longitudinal study of healthy aging and
longevity that enrolled 4935 subjects in 583 families between 2006 and
2009 via three American and one Danish field centers (Sebastiani et al.,
2009, 2013; Newman et al., 2011). Surviving participants are currently
undergoing a second in-person evaluation (taking place in 2015–2018).
The FHS was recently reviewed in Tsao & Vasan (2015).
Biomarkers data
Fasting blood samples in LLFS participants were collected as described in
Newman et al. (2011), and biomarkers to assay were chosen based on
known or hypothetical association with aging-related diseases and
functions (Sebastiani et al., 2016a). Protocols of biomarkers data in FHS
are available from the study web site (https://www.framinghamhea
rtstudy.org/researchers/description-data/index.php).
Derivation of biomarker signatures
The 19 of the 40 available biomarkers assayed in LLFS that were used
for construction of the biomarker signatures appears in Table 1, and
preliminary analysis are detailed in Appendix S1. Hierarchical clustering
and a novel resampling procedure (Sebastiani & Perls, 2016) were
used to detect 26 significant clusters. The distribution of biomarkers
for LLFS participants allocated to each cluster was depicted with side-
by-side boxplots and summarized by means and standard deviations
of each biomarker (Fig. 1 and S5–S17, Tables S2 and S4). Sensitivity
analysis was conducted to examine the robustness of selected clusters
to varying significance levels. To verify the relevance of the 19
biomarkers to define clusters, the analysis was also repeated by
removing one biomarker at a time, and differences in clusters were
examined. Effect of familiarity was examined as described in the
Supporting information.
Annotation of biomarker signatures
Age- and sex-adjusted mixed effect linear models for repeated measures
were used to estimate differences between physiological markers (gait
speed, grip strength, FEV1, digital symbol substitution test and Mini-
Mental State Examination, BMI, pulse rate, and systolic blood pressure)
associated with the clusters (Fig. 3 and Table S5). Cox proportional
hazard models stratified by sex and adjusted by age at enrollment were
used for the analyses of incident events (Table 2).
Calibration of FHS biomarkers
To remove laboratory-to-laboratory effect, an external standardization of
FHS biomarker data using LLFS standards was used.
Replication of associations between biomarker signatures
and morbidity and mortality in FHS
We built and validated a 26-label Bayesian classifier (Hand & Yu, 2001)
to assign the most likely biomarker signature discovered in LLFS to each
FHS participant based on his biomarker data. The accuracy of the
Bayesian classifier was evaluated in the LLFS data to assess the goodness
of fit of the rule and to estimate the proportion of positive predicted
values and the misclassification error. The analyses were also repeated
using the subset of biomarkers available in the FHS. The classifier was
then used to identify the most likely biomarker signature of FHS
participants using the externally standardized biomarker data. In all
cases, uniform prior probabilities were used. Incident risk for mortality
and morbidity in FHS participants in clusters 2–26 were compared to
cluster 1 using Cox proportional hazard regression adjusted for age at
blood collection and stratified by sex.
All analyses were conducted in the statistical program R v3 (https://
www.r-project.org/)
