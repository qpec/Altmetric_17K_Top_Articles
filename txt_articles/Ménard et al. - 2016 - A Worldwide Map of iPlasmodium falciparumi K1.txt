Status report on artemisinin and ACT resistance  
 
September 2015 
 
Key messages 
1. Artemisinin resistance1 is defined as delayed parasite clearance following 
treatment with an artesunate monotherapy, or after treatment with an 
artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). Such resistance represents 
partial resistance. 
2. Delayed parasite clearance will not necessarily lead to treatment failure. In the 
Greater Mekong subregion (GMS), a high treatment failure rate following 
treatment with an ACT has only been observed where there is resistance to the 
partner drug, regardless of the presence of artemisinin resistance. However, 
artemisinin resistance could facilitate the selection of partner drug resistance. 
3. A molecular marker for artemisinin resistance has been identified and will help 
to improve the global surveillance of artemisinin resistance. 
4. Emergence of multidrug resistance, including ACT resistance, and independent 
emergence of artemisinin resistance in the GMS have led to the 
recommendation of elimination of malaria in this region. 
Background  
Artemisinin resistance 
Artemisinin resistance is defined as delayed parasite clearance; this represents a partial resistance that so 
far affects only ring-stage parasites. Most patients who have delayed parasite clearance following 
treatment with an artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) clear their infections. However, this is 
not the case in Cambodia and Thailand, where there is concomitant resistance to the partner drugs such 
as mefloquine and piperaquine.  
It is not clear whether artemisinin resistance has precipitated the emergence of piperaquine resistance, or 
whether it has helped to further select parasites that are already piperaquine resistant. Resistance to 
piperaquine may have emerged independently from resistance to artemisinin, because of the long half-
life of piperaquine and its previous use as a monotherapy (similar to the use of mefloquine). Further 
research is needed to evaluate the exact role of artemisinin resistance in the development or selection of 
drug resistance to partner drugs.  
Molecular marker of artemisinin resistance 
A molecular marker of artemisinin resistance was recently identified. Mutations in the Kelch 13 (K13) 
propeller region are associated with delayed parasite clearance both in vitro and in vivo. The identification 
of the K13 marker for artemisinin resistance has allowed for a more refined definition of resistance that 
includes information on the genotype. However, as the list of mutations associated with artemisinin 
resistance is still evolving, so the definition of artemisinin resistance will continue to evolve. The current 
definition of artemisinin resistance is divided into:

 
suspected artemisinin resistance – defined as a high prevalence of the delayed parasite clearance 
phenotype, or high prevalence of K13 mutants; and  
 
confirmed artemisinin resistance – defined as a combination of delayed parasite clearance and 
K13 resistance-associated mutations in a single patient.  
Confounding factors in these definitions include the effect of partner drugs, immunity, insufficient levels 
of drug in the blood and non-validated K13 mutations.  
A total of 186 K13 alleles, including 108 non-synonymous mutations,2 3 have been reported so far. In 
South-East Asia, distinct alleles originating from multiple independent events of emergence have been 
observed. In the eastern Greater Mekong subregion (GMS) – comprising Cambodia, Lao People’s 
Democratic Republic (PDR) and Viet Nam – the 
mutations C580Y, R539T, Y493H and I543T are 
frequent. In the western GMS – comprising China, 
Myanmar and Thailand – mutations F446L, N458Y, 
P574L and R561H are common. In Africa, non-
synonymous mutations are rare but highly diverse. 
Non-synonymous K13 mutations have been reported 
in Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, 
Comoros, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, 
Gambia, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Rwanda, 
Togo, Uganda and Zambia. The most frequent allele 
observed in Africa is A578S. 
Not 
all 
non-synonymous 
propeller-region 
K13 
mutants reported indicate emerging artemisinin 
resistance. Such mutants can represent “passer-by” 
genotypes; that is, they do not lead to selection of 
the mutant K13 genotype. In addition, the position of 
the mutation affects the clearance phenotype. 
Validation of a K13 mutation as a resistance marker 
will require correlation with slow clearance in clinical 
studies, reduced drug sensitivity in ex vivo or in vitro 
assays (e.g. the ring-stage assay – RSA0–3h ), or 
reduced in vitro sensitivity in transfection studies 
involving insertion of the mutant K13. Table 1 
provides a list (that will have to be updated regularly) 
of associated K13 propeller mutations (i.e. those 
correlated with delayed parasite clearance) and 
confirmed K13 propeller mutations (i.e. those 
confirmed by in vivo and in vitro data). 
Monitoring therapeutic efficacy of ACTs 
Routine monitoring of the therapeutic efficacy of ACTs is essential for making timely changes to treatment 
policy; it can also help to detect early changes in Plasmodium falciparum susceptibility to antimalarial 
drugs. WHO currently recommends monitoring the efficacy of first-line and second-line ACTs every 2 
years in all falciparum-endemic countries. The results of therapeutic efficacy studies (TESs) make it 
possible to determine the: 
 
proportion of patients who are parasitemic on day 3, which is currently the indicator of choice for 
routine monitoring to identify suspected artemisinin resistance in P. falciparum; and 
                                                          
 
2. A non-synonymous mutation is one that changes the gene expressed and the phenotype of the individual.  
3. Preliminary data of the KARMA Project initiated by Institut Pasteur in collaboration with WHO. 
 Status report on artemisinin and ACT resistance  ̶   september 2015 | 3  
 
proportion of treatment failure by 28-day or 42-day follow-up (depending on the partner drug 
half-life in the specific ACT); a treatment failure rate exceeding 10% should prompt a change in 
the national antimalarial treatment policy.  
The flowchart in Fig. 1 outlines the recommended steps in the decision-making process for the 
interpretation of and response to TES findings. 
Figure 1. 
 Decision-making process based on TES results 
 
If artemisinin resistance is suspected because of slow clearance in a clinical trial or TES, K13 marker 
analysis (e.g. from filter-paper blood spots) should be prioritized. If resistance is suspected based on a 
survey with molecular data only, it should be confirmed by studies that combine information on the 
clinical phenotype (delayed parasite clearance) and the K13 genotype from the same parasite strain. If 
necessary, the K13 mutant should be validated as a resistance marker using an in vitro assay such as the 
RSA0–3h. 
Possible implications of delayed parasite clearance 
Delayed parasite clearance after treatment with an ACT is of great concern. Failure to rapidly clear 
parasites could compromise the use of artemisinin for the treatment of severe malaria. Also, slow parasite 
clearance causes more parasites to be exposed to the partner medicine alone, increasing the risk of 
selection of partner drug resistance, which in turn increases the risk of treatment failure. Currently, most 
patients with a delayed parasite clearance response are still cured by ACTs, provided that the partner drug 
remains effective. Finally partial resistance could include development of total artemisinin resistance. 
Response to artemisinin resistance and eliminating malaria in the GMS 
Emergency response to artemisinin resistance in the GMS 
In April 2013, WHO launched the Emergency response to artemisinin resistance (ERAR) in the GMS (1).The 
framework urges partners to work in a coordinated manner to provide malaria interventions to all at-risk 
groups; to achieve tighter coordination and management of field operations; to obtain better information 
for containment of artemisinin resistance; and to strengthen regional oversight and support.  
 Status report on artemisinin and ACT resistance  ̶   september 2015 | 4  
WHO has received support from the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Bill & 
Melinda Gates Foundation to strengthen the coordination of and technical support for activities to 
contain artemisinin resistance in the GSM. The project is implemented by the WHO Global Malaria 
Programme, the WHO Regional Office for South-East Asia, the WHO Regional Office for the Western 
Pacific and WHO country offices. A regional hub has been established in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, to 
support and help with coordination of activities. 
In line with the call to action and recommendations contained in the ERAR, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, 
Tuberculosis and Malaria has allocated US$ 100 million to a regional artemisinin initiative, funding 
activities to contain and eliminate artemisinin resistance in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand and 
Viet Nam. The regional artemisinin initiative includes a regional component to support cross-border 
activities.  
Malaria elimination in the GMS 
The incidence of malaria has been greatly reduced over the past 10–20 years. However, there is concern 
that falciparum malaria in the GMS is becoming increasingly resistant to antimalarial medicines; at the 
border between Cambodia and Thailand, falciparum malaria could become untreatable within a few 
years. In addition, molecular studies have confirmed that artemsinin resistance has emerged 
independently in many areas of the GMS. Against this background, WHO’s Malaria Policy Advisory 
Committee recommended in September 2014 the adoption of the goal of elimination of P. falciparum in 
the GMS by 2030. Subsequently, at the World Health Assembly in May 2015, WHO launched a Strategy for 
malaria elimination in the GMS (2015–2030) (2), which was endorsed by all the GMS countries. 
Country updates on ACT efficacy 
The information given here is taken from the Global report on antimalarial efficacy and drug resistance: 
2000–2010 (3). In addition WHO regularly provides updates on the global status of antimalarial drug 
efficacy of both P. falciparum and P. vivax, through reports and maps which are regularly updated on the 
WHO website (http://www.who.int/malaria/areas/drug_resistance/maps/en/).  
South-East Asia 
Cambodia 
Background 
 
Artemisinin resistance was first identified in clinical studies in 2006; however, retrospective analysis 
of molecular markers indicates that artemisinin resistance probably emerged in 2001, before the 
widespread deployment of ACTs in Cambodia. 
 
Due to high failure rates with artesunate-mefloquine (ASMQ), the first-line treatment for the 
treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria, was changed from co-blistered ASMQ to fixed-
dose dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ) in Pailin in 2008, and then nationwide in 2010. 
 
After the implementation of this new treatment policy, an increase in treatment failures was 
quickly identified in TESs using DHA-PPQ in Pailin. Between 2008 and 2014, similar trends were 
observed in seven provinces, mainly in the western and northern part of the country. The high 
treatment failure rates observed with DHA-PPQ are related to the presence of piperaquine 
resistance, which is spreading from western to north-eastern Cambodia. 
 
A consensus meeting held in November 2011 recommended the use of atovaquone-proguanil 
delivered as directly-observed therapy for Pailin province as a short-term interim solution, with 
stringent follow-up for monitoring resistance. Mutations conferring resistance to atovaquone were 
observed less than a year after the implementation of the drug as first-line therapy, which was 
sufficient reason to change the recommendation. 
 
 Status report on artemisinin and ACT resistance  ̶   september 2015 | 5  
Update 
 
A consensus meeting on the national treatment policy for P. falciparum was held in January 2014. 
ASMQ was re-introduced as first-line treatment, since the proportion of falciparum strains with 
multiple Pfmdr1 copy numbers (which confer mefloquine resistance) is currently minimal in the 
area. Quinine plus doxycycline over 7 days has been adopted as rescue therapy. DHA-PPQ remains 
the first-line treatment in the rest of the country. 
Lao PDR 
Update 
 
In 2013, a trial conducted in Champasack province found that 22.2% of the patients treated with 
artemether-lumefantrine (AL) were still parasitemic on day 3 after treatment. 
 
The emergence of artemisinin resistance in southern Lao PDR is supported by the identification in 
2013 of the presence of K13 mutants (mainly C580Y and R539T) in the circulating parasite 
populations. 
 
The therapeutic efficacy of AL has not been affected, and cure rates have remained high since 
2005. 
 
Containment activities started in 2014, and TESs are now being conducted in Atteupeu, 
Champasack and Sekong provinces. 
Myanmar 
Background 
 
Artemisinin resistance probably emerged at the border between Myanmar and Thailand in 2001, 
but was not clearly recognized until 2008. 
 
Since 2009, data show consistently delayed parasite clearance times among a significant proportion 
of patients treated with ACTs; this trend was observed in all the three first-line ACTs (AL, ASMQ and 
DHA-PPQ). 
 
The results showing delayed parasite clearance rates in several parts of the country led to the 
initiation of the Myanmar Artemisinin Resistance Containment framework, in line with the 
recommendations described in the Global Plan for Artemisinin Resistance Containment (GPARC) 
(4). 
 
The three first-line ACTs used in the country are still effective, with high cure rates. 
Update 
 
Studies evaluating the presence of K13 mutants have shown that the predominant K13 mutant 
found in Myanmar is likely to have arisen independently rather than to have spread from 
Cambodia. 
 
A new K13 propeller polymorphism (F446I) is potentially associated with delayed parasite 
clearance. Preliminary results indicate a high prevalence of the K13 F446I mutation along both the 
China–Myanmar border and the India–Myanmar border. Research is ongoing to validate the role of 
this new mutant in artemisinin resistance. 
 
ACT efficacy remains high on both sides of the border between India and Myanmar. 
Thailand 
Background 
 
Containment activities on the Thailand side of the border between Cambodia and Thailand began 
simultaneously with those in Cambodia in 2008. 
 Status report on artemisinin and ACT resistance  ̶   september 2015 | 6  
 
Thailand initially used a regimen of 2-day ASMQ as first-line treatment. Despite the change to a 3-
day regimen in 2009, treatment failures with ASMQ increased in Kanchanaburi, Ranong, Tak and 
Ubonratchathani, reaching levels of at least 10%. 
 
High treatment failure rates observed in Thailand after treatment with ASMQ could be explained by 
the presence of mefloquine resistance (which has been confirmed countrywide) in addition to 
artemisinin resistance. Mefloquine drug pressure has been considerable over the last decades, 
since Thailand has been using different regimens of mefloquine (15 to 25 mg/kg) as monotherapy 
or in combination with artesunate. 
Update 
 
The efficacy of AL was evaluated in two provinces in 2012; the treatment failure rate was close to 
or exceeded 10%. 
 
During a consensus meeting held in 2015, DHA-PPQ became the first-line treatment in the country, 
and its efficacy is currently being evaluated. 
Viet Nam 
Background 
 
Delayed parasite clearance was first detected after treatment with DHA-PPQ in the Bu Dang district 
of Binh Phuoc province in 2009. 
 
Routine monitoring of treatment with DHA-PPQ also detected other foci of delayed parasite 
clearance in Gia Lai province (2010), Dak Nong province (2011), Quang Nam province (2012), and 
Kon Tum and Khanh Hoa provinces (2014). 
 
In mid-2011, Viet Nam began containment activities following GPARC recommendations with the 
support of the WHO Western Pacific Regional Office and the WHO country office. 
Update 
 
TES conducted since 2010 using DHA-PPQ reported a treatment efficacy of more than 95%, despite 
a day-3 positivity rate of up to 36%.

Africa 
 
The efficacy of ACTs is being monitored in most malaria-endemic countries. There have been some 
reports of delayed parasite clearance during routine TES of ACTs conducted in Africa, but these 
reports have not been consistent over time. 
 
To date, the K13 mutations observed have not been associated with slow parasite clearance. 
Currently, Africa appears to be free of the resistance-associated Asian alleles. 
 
TESs show that, in general, ACTs remain efficacious. 
South America 
Suriname  
 
Routine surveillance of ACT efficacy between 2005 and 2006, and in 2011 in gold miners, reported 
an increase of day-3 positivity rate (from 2% to >20%), with a high cure rate at day 28. In 2013–
2014, a study using artesunate and mefloquine did not confirm the high positivity rate at day 3, and 
sequencing of K13 of strains collected during this study revealed only wild-type K13. 
Guyana 
 
The last TES study evaluating AL was conducted from May 2011 to July 2012; a total of 92 patients 
were enrolled, with 68 completing the day-28 follow-up. A total of 70.8% of day-3 slides were 
reported to be positive, but after a review of quality control, this result was considered to be 
flawed. A new clinical study evaluating 7-day artesunate for uncomplicated falciparum malaria was 
started in 2014. The efficacy of artesunate was 100% at day 28, whereas only 2% of the patients 
had persistent parasitaemia at day 3 after treatment. The 47 strains collected all showed K13 wild 
type. 
 
A retrospective analysis of blood samples collected in 2010 for a histidine rich protein-2 (HRP2) 
surveillance study, detected the C580Y mutation. All five C580Y mutant samples detected had a 
nearly identical haplotype, suggesting that they had a common origin that was distinct from the 
South-East Asian C580Y haplotype. A survey for K13 sequencing is ongoing in the region where five 
of the earlier cases originated. 
French Guyana 
 
Between 2009 and 2013, the day-3 positivity rate among patients treated in Cayenne Hospital 
after treatment with AL was 7.5%, but the treatment was not systematically supervised. So far, 
no K13 mutant strains have been reported from French Guyana. 
Conclusion 
Despite the delayed response to artemisinin in some areas of the GMS, ACTs remain the most effective 
treatment for uncomplicated falciparum malaria. Most patients with delayed parasite clearance are 
cured, as long as the partner drug remains effective. Routine monitoring must continue to ensure that the 
recommended ACTs are effective, that changes in national treatment policies can be implemented in a 
timely manner, and that artemisinin resistance can be detected early. Assessment of K-13 propeller-
region mutants will greatly facilitate the tracking of artemisinin resistance as it emerges. Due to the 
existence of multidrug resistance (including ACT resistance) in the GMS, elimination of falciparum malaria 
has become a high priority. The role played by artemisinin resistance in the development of partner drug 
resistance needs to be further evaluated.
