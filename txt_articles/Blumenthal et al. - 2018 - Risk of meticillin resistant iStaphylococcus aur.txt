Abstract
Abstract
Objective — To evaluate the relation between penicillin allergy and
development of meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and
C difficile.
Design — Population based matched cohort study.
Setting — United Kingdom general practice (1995-2015).
Participants — 301 399 adults without previous MRSA or C difficile
enrolled in the Health Improvement Network database: 64 141 had a
penicillin allergy and 237 258 comparators matched on age, sex, and
study entry time.
Main outcome measures — The primary outcome was risk of incident
MRSA and C difficile. Secondary outcomes were use of β lactam
antibiotics and β lactam alternative antibiotics.
Results — Among 64 141 adults with penicillin allergy and 237 258
matched comparators, 1365 developed MRSA (442 participants with
penicillin allergy and 923 comparators) and 1688 developed C difficile
(442 participants with penicillin allergy and 1246 comparators) during a
mean 6.0 years of follow-up. Among patients with penicillin allergy the
adjusted hazard ratio for MRSA was 1.69 (95% confidence interval 1.51
to 1.90) and for C difficile was 1.26 (1.12 to 1.40). The adjusted incidence
rate ratios for antibiotic use among patients with penicillin allergy were
4.15 (95% confidence interval 4.12 to 4.17) for macrolides, 3.89 (3.66
to 4.12) for clindamycin, and 2.10 (2.08 to 2.13) for fluoroquinolones.
Increased use of β lactam alternative antibiotics accounted for 55% of
the increased risk of MRSA and 35% of the increased risk of C difficile.
Conclusions — Documented penicillin allergy was associated with an
increased risk of MRSA and C difficile that was mediated by the
increased use of β lactam alternative antibiotics. Systematically
addressing penicillin allergies may be an important public health strategy
to reduce the incidence of MRSA and C difficile among patients with a
penicillin allergy label.
Introduction
One third of patients report a drug allergy (ie, adverse or allergic
reaction),1 the most commonly implicated drug being penicillin
and documented in 5-16% of patients.1-5 Being labelled with a
penicillin allergy affects future prescribing for infections in both
outpatients and inpatients, with prescribed antibiotics often more
broad spectrum and toxic.2 6-8 Unnecessary use of broad spectrum
antibiotics leads to the development of drug resistant bacteria,
including meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA),
and healthcare associated infections such as Clostridium difficile
related colitis.9-13
Most patients with a documented penicillin allergy are not
allergic—that is, there is no immediate hypersensitivity.14 15
After evaluation by an allergist, about 95% of patients with
reported penicillin allergies were found to be penicillin tolerant.14
The discrepancy between labelled and confirmed penicillin
allergy stems from misdiagnosis (eg, a viral exanthem is
misinterpreted as an allergy), misassumptions (eg, an
intolerance, such as a headache, is listed as an allergy), and
remote timing of the allergy evaluation, since 80% of patients
with immediate hypersensitivity to penicillin are no longer
allergic after 10 years.16 Most patients with a penicillin allergy
label therefore unnecessarily avoid penicillins, and often other
related β lactam antibiotics, such as cephalosporins.6 7

 To evaluate the public health consequences of having a penicillin
allergy label, we conducted a population based matched cohort
study and examined the relation between a newly recorded
penicillin allergy and the risk of incident MRSA and C difficile.
Methods
Data source
We used data from the Health Improvement Network (THIN),
an electronic medical record database of 11.1 million patients
registered with general practices in the United Kingdom.
Because the National Health Service requires people to register
with a general practice regardless of health status, THIN is a
population based cohort representative of the UK general
population.17 During consultations with patients in primary care,
general practitioners (GPs) enter clinical data, including height,
weight, smoking status, diagnoses, and prescription drugs.
Patient diagnoses are recorded using READ codes, the UK’s
standard clinical terminology system.18 Drug allergies are linked
to a drug prescription, or recorded as a diagnosis (eg, personal
history of penicillin allergy). The GP enters details of the drug
allergy, including reaction type, severity of reaction, and
certainty of diagnosis. All GPs are trained in data entry, with
the quality of their data periodically reviewed. Previous studies
using THIN have confirmed the validity of both prescriptions
and diagnoses.19 20
Study design
We performed a matched cohort study among participants aged
more than 18 years, who were enrolled in the THIN database
between 1995 and 2015. Eligible participants had no history of
MRSA or C difficile diagnoses before study entry and were
required to have at least one year of enrolment with a general
practice before entering the study to allow for assessment of
exposure and covariates. We identified adults with their first
recorded penicillin allergy and selected up to five penicillin
users without a penicillin allergy matched on age (one year
either way), sex, and study entry time (within one year either
way). Such comparators were chosen to further ensure the
comparability of indications for penicillin use (eg, infection
tendency) and associated features. The index date for cases was
the date of first entry of an allergy diagnosis in the THIN
database; the matched index date for comparators was within
one year of a penicillin prescription.
Assessment of exposure and outcomes
The exposure of interest was a documented penicillin allergy,
defined as an allergy to a penicillin antibiotic linked to a
penicillin prescription, or one or more relevant READ diagnosis
codes for a penicillin allergy or adverse effect (see supplemental
table 1).
The primary outcomes were incident cases of doctor diagnosed
MRSA and C difficile during the follow-up period. We identified
MRSA and C difficile by the presence of one or more relevant
READ diagnosis codes.21-24 For MRSA, codes indicated MRSA
infection, carriage, eradication, or decontamination whereas for
C difficile, codes indicated C difficile infection or detection of
antigen or toxin (see supplementary table 1).
We also assessed antibiotic utilization during the follow-up
period, derived from the prescription record. We grouped all
antibiotics prescribed into classes: penicillins, first generation
cephalosporins, macrolides, clindamycin, fluoroquinolones,
tetracyclines, and sulfonamides. Given that vancomycin,
aminoglycosides, and linezolid are commonly administered
parenterally and therefore seldom administered to outpatients
by GPs, we assessed these antibiotics separately.
Assessment of covariates
We identified demographic and lifestyle factors before the index
date, such as age, sex, body mass index, socioeconomic status,
smoking status, and alcohol use. READ diagnosis codes at the
index date were used to ascertain relevant comorbidities
(diabetes, renal disease, hemodialysis, malignancy, liver disease,
and infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)) and
to calculate the adapted Charlson comorbidity index25 at baseline.
Using the prescription records, we identified the number of
antibiotics prescribed in the year before the index date and
whether proton pump inhibitors or systemic corticosteroids were
used at baseline. Concomitant allergies to cephalosporin
antibiotics and other antibiotics were linked to prescriptions or
identified using READ diagnosis codes. We determined
participants who were residents of nursing homes at baseline.
Finally, we calculated the number of visits to a GP and hospital
admissions during the year before the index date.
Statistical analysis
We compared baseline characteristics between participants with
penicillin allergy and their comparators. Follow-up time for
each participant was calculated from the index date to the date
of one of several events: the study endpoints (MRSA or C
difficile), death, or end of the study (31 December 2015),
whichever occurred first.
We identified incident MRSA cases and number of person years
of follow-up for each cohort separately. We calculated the
hazard ratios for the relation of penicillin allergy status to the
risk of MRSA using Cox proportional hazard models. In the
multivariable Cox model we adjusted for age, sex, body mass
index, socioeconomic status, smoking status, alcohol use,
Charlson comorbidity index, hemodialysis, number of antibiotic
prescriptions, proton pump inhibitor use, corticosteroid use,
other antibiotic allergies, resident of nursing home, visits to a
GP, and admissions to hospital. We repeated the same analyses
for the risk of C difficile. We also calculated the absolute risk
difference.
In both the penicillin allergy cohort and the comparison cohort
we determined the rates of subsequent antibiotic utilization by
class. We used Poisson regression models to estimate the
incidence rate ratio for the relation of penicillin allergy status
to the rates of subsequent antibiotic use, while adjusting for the
same covariates.
We performed mediation analyses to examine the extent to
which the effect of penicillin allergy status on the risk of MRSA
or C difficile was through its effect on utilization of β lactam
alternative antibiotics.26 Specifically, we grouped utilization
into five categories based on previous studies that evaluated the
impact of various antibiotics on the risk of MRSA and C
difficile9-13: fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, macrolides,
vancomycin, aminoglycosides, and linezolid (all β lactam
alternative antibiotics considered in this study);
fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, and macrolides;
fluoroquinolones and macrolides; fluoroquinolones and
clindamycin; and fluoroquinolones alone. Using marginal
structural models we then estimated the natural direct effect (ie,
the effect of penicillin allergy status on the risk of MRSA or C
difficile not through a specific group of antibiotics) and the
natural indirect effect (ie, the effect of penicillin allergy status
on the risk of MRSA or C difficile through a specific group of
antibiotics), while adjusting for the same confounding

 variables,26 and reported the adjusted risk ratio and percentage
mediated.
For all analyses we imputed unknown values for covariates (ie,
missing body mass index, alcohol use, and smoking status)
using a sequential regression method based on a set of covariates
as predictors. To minimize random error, we imputed five
datasets and then combined estimates from these datasets by
calculating effect estimates from each imputed dataset and then
averaging estimates and their confidence intervals using Rubin’s
rules.27 All analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.2
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Patient and public involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research question or
the outcome measures, nor were they involved in developing
plans for implementation of the study. No patients were asked
to advise on interpretation or writing up of results. There are no
plans to disseminate the results of the research to study
participants or the relevant patient community. Individual patient
consent was not sought given the use of anonymized data.
Results
Cohort identification and characteristics
We identified 64 141 patients with a documented penicillin
allergy and 237 258 matched comparators (table 1). Patients
with penicillin allergy were identified through allergies linked
to prescriptions for penicillin antibiotics (63 245/64 141, 98.6%).
Documented penicillin allergies consisted of allergies (74.4%),
intolerances (14.5%), and adverse effects (11.1%). Most allergies
were considered of moderate severity (86.0%) with likely
certainty (73.6%).
Patients with penicillin allergy were similar to their comparators
for age, sex, body mass index, socioeconomic status, smoking
status, and alcohol use (table 2). They were also similar for
diabetes, renal disease, hemodialysis, malignancy, liver disease,
HIV, Charlson comorbidity index, previous antibiotic
prescriptions, use of proton pump inhibitors and systemic
corticosteroids, nursing home residency, visits to a GP, and
hospital admissions. Other antibiotic allergies were more
common in patients with a penicillin allergy.
Penicillin allergy and risk of MRSA and C
difficile
During the mean follow-up time of 6.0 years for patients with
penicillin allergy and 6.1 years for comparator patients, 442
patients with penicillin allergy and 923 comparator patients
developed MRSA, and 442 patients with penicillin allergy and
1246 comparator patients developed C difficile (table 3 and
supplemental table 2).
The age, sex, and study entry time matched hazard ratios for
patients with penicillin allergy were 1.84 (95% confidence
interval 1.64 to 2.06) for MRSA and 1.37 (1.23 to 1.53) for C
difficile. The matched and multivariable adjusted hazard ratios
for patients with penicillin allergy were 1.69 (1.51 to 1.90) for
MRSA and 1.26 (1.12 to 1.40) for C difficile, respectively. The
corresponding adjusted risk differences were 49/100 000 person
years for MRSA and 27/100 000 person years for C difficile.
Penicillin allergy and subsequent antibiotic
utilization
Patients with penicillin allergy were less often prescribed
penicillin than their comparators (adjusted incidence rate ratio
0.30, 95% confidence interval 0.30 to 0.31), but had increased
use of macrolide antibiotics (4.15, 4.12 to 4.17), clindamycin
(3.89, 3.66 to 4.12]), fluoroquinolones (2.10, 2.08 to 2.13),
tetracyclines (1.75, 1.73 to 1.76), and sulfonamide antibiotics
(1.26, 1.25 to 1.27; table 4). Though vancomycin,
aminoglycosides, and linezolid were overall infrequently
prescribed, they were more often prescribed to patients with
penicillin allergy than to their comparators (supplemental table
3).
Mediation effects of alternative antibiotic use
Compared with patients who did not receive penicillins, patients
receiving penicillins did not have an increased risk of MRSA
(adjusted risk ratio 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.95 to 1.20),
but had an increased risk of C difficile (1.18, 1.06 to 1.31;
supplemental table 4). Patients receiving macrolide antibiotics
had an increased risk of MRSA (1.72, 1.54 to 1.91) and C
difficile (1.30, 1.18 to 1.43). Patients receiving clindamycin had
an increased risk of MRSA (2.97, 2.11 to 4.16) and C difficile
(2.76, 2.00 to 3.81). Patients receiving fluoroquinolones had an
increased risk of MRSA (2.38, 2.12 to 2.67) and C difficile
(1.72, 1.54 to 1.93).
The effect of a penicillin allergy on the risk of MRSA was 55%
mediated through β lactam alternative antibiotic classes; 55%
mediated through fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, and
macrolides; 54% mediated through fluoroquinolones and
macrolides; 26% mediated through fluoroquinolones and
clindamycin; and 24% mediated through fluoroquinolones alone
(table 5). The effect of penicillin allergy on C difficile was 35%
mediated through β lactam alternative antibiotic classes; 26%
mediated through fluoroquinolones, clindamycin, and
macrolides; 24% mediated through fluoroquinolones and
macrolides; 20% mediated through fluoroquinolones and
clindamycin; and 16% mediated through fluoroquinolones alone.
Discussion
In this large cohort study reflective of the United Kingdom
general population, we found that a penicillin allergy label was
associated with a 69% increased risk of MRSA and a 26%
increased risk of C difficile. Once documented, a penicillin
allergy resulted in increased use of β lactam alternative
antibiotics, with a fourfold increased incidence of macrolides
and clindamycin utilization, and a twofold increased incidence
of fluoroquinolone utilization. Furthermore, more than half of
the increased MRSA risk and more than one third of the
increased C difficile risk among patients with penicillin allergy
was attributable to administered β lactam alternative antibiotics.
Comparison with other studies and policy
implications
We found that patients with a penicillin allergy label had nearly
a 70% increased risk of new MRSA than their matched
comparators, even after adjustment for known MRSA risk
factors.28 This provides supporting evidence for a previous US
study that showed a 14% increased MRSA prevalence in
inpatients who were allergic to penicillin.8 Our result emphasises
that outpatient use of antibiotics is strongly associated with the
risk of developing MRSA.22 28 Consistent with previous studies,
we found that β lactam alternative antibiotics increased the risk
of MRSA to a greater degree than did penicillins12 13 29 30; whereas
the mechanism of resistance is not known, the same factors that
predispose staphylococcus to develop resistance to meticillin
are thought to predispose staphylococcus to multidrug resistance
that includes resistance to meticillin.12 29 31 With more than half

 of the increased MRSA risk among patients with listed penicillin
allergy directly attributable to increased outpatient β lactam
alternative antibiotic use (largely fluoroquinolones and
macrolides), this risk appears modifiable if prescribing patterns
among those with penicillin allergy could be altered.
C difficile is responsible for almost one half million infections
and 15 000 deaths each year in the US, and the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention consider C difficile one of three
urgent threats to public health.32 Patients with penicillin allergy
in this study had a 26% increased C difficile risk compared with
age, sex, and study entry time matched comparators after
adjustment for other known risk factors for C difficile.10 33-35 This
result also corroborates the previous US study, which found a
23% increased C difficile prevalence in hospital patients with
a penicillin allergy.8 While other studies similarly identified that
clindamycin and fluoroquinolones were associated with the
greatest risk of C difficile,9-11 we found that 35% of the
heightened risk of C difficile in patients with penicillin allergy
was directly attributable to use of β lactam alternative
antibiotics, with quinolone use alone responsible for 16% of
the heightened risk. The mechanism by which antibiotic use
precipitates C difficile is through disruption of the host
microbiome and creation of an environment where C difficile
can overgrow.36 Antibiotics not captured in this dataset (eg,
those administered at dialysis or in hospitals) and non-antibiotic
risk factors2 34 are likely responsible for the remainder of C
difficile cases. Although current efforts to reduce C difficile
largely focus on reducing C difficile infections in hospitals and
rehabilitation centers, one third of C difficile infections occur
in the community, and occur in outpatients.37 Our findings
suggest that more systematic efforts to identify patients with
listed penicillin allergy who are not truly allergic to penicillins
could help decrease rates of community associated C difficile.
In this study, patients with documented penicillin allergy had
an increased incidence of broad spectrum antibiotic use,
including the extended Gram positive spectrum antibiotics
vancomycin and linezolid, which should be reserved for patients
with suspected or known MRSA (or vancomycin resistant
enterococci for linezolid).38 39 Use of the most narrow spectrum
antibiotic that is effective for a given infection is a cornerstone
of evidence based treatment for infection and is responsible
antibiotic stewardship.38 Antibiotic stewardship committees
enforce this aim in the hospital setting, with evaluations for
penicillin allergy occasionally included in stewardship efforts.40
This analysis emphasises the importance of performing
outpatient antibiotic stewardship and the role that penicillin
allergy evaluations might play. Although diagnostic testing for
penicillin allergy was developed in the 1960s, and has recently
garnered the support of a variety of professional
organizations,38 41 42 less than 0.1% of patients with a penicillin
allergy label undergo confirmatory testing.15 Evaluation of
penicillin allergy often involves a skin test, and if the result of
skin testing is negative, a challenge dose of penicillin or
amoxicillin is administered under medical observation.15 With
these evaluation tools, evaluation of penicillin allergy has a
more than 99% negative predictive value, takes less than three
hours to perform, and costs about $220 (£165; €188; 2016
currency conversion).15 43 Previous observational cohorts have
shown that more than 90% of patients with listed penicillin
allergies can be safely treated with penicillins.14 15 40
Strengths and limitations of this study
In this study we used a representative population based cohort
to increase the generalizability of our findings. Clinical data to
characterise drug use, outcomes, and covariates were entered
by physicians and captured electronically. The dataset used
included granular allergy data linked to penicillin prescriptions
and defined by type, severity, and certainty. Our study design
used a comparator group who had recently been prescribed a
penicillin but did not have a resultant penicillin allergy. Patients
had high antibiotic use in the previous year since almost the
entire cohort had recently had a penicillin (for infection) at
baseline for cohort eligibility. Our GP practice based dataset
could have missed the detection of some inpatient cases of
MRSA and C difficile; however, these potential non-differential
misclassifications would have biased our results towards the
null, rendering our findings conservative. MRSA and C difficile
were identified by physician diagnosis records. This approach
has been successfully used in many previous epidemiologic
studies,13 19-24 44 45 as microbial infections such as MRSA and C
difficile are made objectively using highly accurate
microbiologic and serologic tests. Although we used composite
outcomes for MRSA and C difficile that were not restricted to
infections, it is unlikely that GPs would screen asymptomatic
patients and more likely that diagnoses occurred in relevant
clinical contexts where infections were suspected. Further, our
findings remained consistent and strong when we restricted the
analyses to code subgroups suggestive of infections.
Additionally, MRSA carriage alone is an important outcome
that confers an increased risk of MRSA infection,46 and indicates
antibiotic resistance—a healthcare priority throughout the
world.39 47 Finally, by choosing to study only the first
documentation of MRSA and C difficile, we ensured capture of
only new colonization or infection, which are clinically
important outcomes. Although we controlled for many known
potential confounders in these data, our observational study
cannot rule out potential unknown or residual confounding.
Conclusions
In this population based cohort study, a listed penicillin allergy
was associated with a statistically significantly increased risk
of MRSA and C difficile compared with patients matched by
age, sex, and study entry time. Approximately one third to more
than one half of this risk was attributed to use of non-β lactam
antibiotics administered to outpatients. As infections with
resistant organisms increase, systematic efforts to confirm or
rule out the presence of true penicillin allergy may be an
important public health strategy to reduce the incidence of
MRSA and C difficile.
What is already known on this topic
Penicillin allergy is the most commonly documented drug allergy, reported
by about 10% of patients
Although documented allergies impact prescribing behavior, a documented
penicillin allergy does not often represent true, immediate hypersensitivity
to penicillin
Previous studies have identified specific antibiotic uses that increase the
risk of MRSA and Clostridium difficile
What this study adds
Patients with a documented penicillin allergy have an increased risk of
new MRSA and C difficile that are modifiable, to some degree, through
changes in antibiotic prescribing
