Abstract
Purpose: Conventional chemotherapy has modest efficacy in
advanced adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACC). Tumor recurrence is a
major challenge in the management of ACC patients. Here, we
evaluated the antitumor effect of a novel small-molecule inhibitor
of the MDM2–p53 interaction (MI-773) combined with cisplatin
in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) ACC tumors.
Experimental Design: Therapeutic strategies with MI-773
and/or cisplatin were evaluated in SCID mice harboring PDX
ACC tumors (UM-PDX-HACC-5) and in low passage primary
human ACC cells (UM-HACC-2A, -2B, -5, -6) in vitro. The effect of
therapy on the fraction of cancer stem cells (CSC) was determined
by flow cytometry for ALDH activity and CD44 expression.
Results: Combined therapy with MI-773 with cisplatin caused
p53 activation, induction of apoptosis, and regression of ACC
PDX tumors. Western blots revealed induction of MDM2, p53 and
downstream p21 expression, and regulation of apoptosis-related
proteins PUMA, BAX, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and active caspase-9 upon
MI-773 treatment. Both single-agent MI-773 and MI-773 com-
bined with cisplatin decreased the fraction of CSCs in PDX ACC
tumors. Notably, neoadjuvant MI-773 and surgery eliminated
tumor recurrences during a postsurgical follow-up of more than
300 days. In contrast, 62.5% of mice that received vehicle control
presented with palpable tumor recurrences within this time
period (P ¼ 0.0097).
Conclusions: Collectively, these data demonstrate that thera-
peutic inhibition of MDM2–p53 interaction by MI-773 decreased
the CSC fraction, sensitized ACC xenograft tumors to cisplatin, and
eliminated tumor recurrence. These results suggest that patients
with ACC might benefit from the therapeutic inhibition of the
MDM2–p53 interaction. Clin Cancer Res; 23(4); 1036–48. �2016 AACR.
Introduction
Salivary gland tumors are typically not responsive to conven-
tional chemotherapy. Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is one of
the most common malignancies arising from minor and major
salivary glands (1). Despite the apparent "benign" behavior
characterized by slow tumor growth, ACC is relentless. It is highly
destructive to adjacent anatomic sites and exhibits a high fre-
quency of perineural invasion events that leads to severe mor-
bidity, particularly as this tumor grows toward the brain (2). The
slow and indolent clinical course often leads to a late diagnosis,
when tumor is already at advanced stages and systemic interven-
tion is required to prevent distant metastasis and recurrence after
surgical resection. Unfortunately, current standard chemotherapy
(e.g., platinum-based drugs) has shown limited long-term efficacy
in ACCpatients (3–5). Theprevalence of recurrence is high mainly
due to late hematogenous dissemination of cancer cells primarily
to lungs, bone, and liver (4). Novel mechanism-based therapies to
overcome drug resistance are desperately needed to enhance the
survival and quality of life for patients with ACC.
The mechanisms involved in the resistance of ACC to chemo-
therapy are poorly understood. The first-line chemotherapy for
ACC often includes cisplatin, which is frequently combined with
other classes of antineoplastic agents [e.g., 5-fluorouracil (5-FU);
refs. 3, 6]. However, data from clinical trials with these drug
combinations are not promising, with modest efficacy in ACC
(7). The combination of cisplatin with doxorubicin and cyclo-
phosphamide mediated only partial therapeutic responses (8).
Another study tested the efficacy of combination cisplatin, 5-FU,
and epirubicin in patients with advanced, symptomatic ACC (9).
From 8 patients enrolled in this study, one showed partial
response to therapy and 5 had stable disease. Besides the low
sample size, one important limitation of this study is the total

 period of evaluation (62.3 months), when it is known that around
half of ACCs recur only after 10 years (10). Notably, most ACC
tumors express the proto-oncogene c-KIT. However, dasatinib (a c-
KIT inhibitor) was not effective in a phase II clinical trial with ACC
patients (11). The scarcity of preclinical/clinical evidence and lack
of response to conventional drugs in the daily clinical practice is
reflected on the most recent guideline from the National Com-
prehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), in which no specific che-
motherapeutic drug/regimen is indicated for the treatment of these
patients. To improve the prediction of patient outcomes, NCCN
has incorporated nomograms (i.e., statistical model using regres-
sion analysis) to guidelines as an alternative method for TNM
staging system. Notably, this method was proven to be accurate in
the prediction of survival and recurrence in ACC patients (12).
The tumor suppressor p53 is often inactivated in cancer (13).
Important functions of wild-type p53 (e.g., cell-cycle control,
DNA repair, induction of apoptosis) are regulated by its interac-
tion with murine double minute 2 (MDM2; ref. 14). This protein
interaction forms an autoregulatory negative feedback loop, that
is, nuclear p53 induces the expression of MDM2, which in turn
binds directly to p53, provoking its degradation through the 26S
proteasomal pathway. This interaction is important to maintain
low cellular levels of p53 in physiologic conditions (14, 15).
However, overexpression of MDM2 leads to p53 inactivation,
which contributes to tumorigenic processes (16). Of note, MDM2
expression levels have been associated with tumor progression
and poor prognosis of ACC patients (17, 18).
Recently, Wang and colleagues have developed a small-mole-
cule inhibitor of the MDM2–p53 interaction (MI-773, patented
by Sanofi as SAR405838), pursuing the p53 activation as a new
anticancer strategy (19). MI-773 has a high binding affinity to
MDM2 (Ki ¼ 0.88 nmol/L), preventing MDM2 interaction with
p53. Indeed, MI-773 is capable of wild-type p53 reactivation in
cancer cell lines and several preclinical models of cancer, for
example, osteosarcoma, leukemia, colon, and prostate cancer
(19, 20). Considering the important role of MDM2 in ACC, our
group has tested the effect of MI-773 in preclinical models of ACC
(21). We observed that therapeutic inhibition of MDM2 with MI-
773 restored p53 function, as shown by the activation of its
downstream-related protein (i.e., p21). Here, we went a step
further and evaluated the effect of MI-773 in combination with
cisplatin in preclinical models of ACC. MI-773 and cisplatin drug
combination induced robust and durable ACC tumor regression.
Furthermore, this therapy significantly decreased the proportion
of cancer stem cells (CSC), which has been associated with
cisplatin resistance in head and neck tumors (22). Collectively,
these results suggest that patients with ACC might benefit from
neoadjuvant therapeutic inhibition of the MDM2–p53 interac-
tion combined with conventional chemotherapy with cisplatin.
Materials and Methods
Salivary ACC cells
Primary cell cultures were generated from human tumor speci-
mens and named "University of Michigan Human Adenoid Cystic
Carcinoma (UM-HACC)" series, as described previously (21, 23).
UM-HACC-2A, UM-HACC-2B, UM-HACC-5, and UM-HACC-6
cells were maintained in salivary gland culture media, that is,
high-glucose DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mmol/L
L-glutamine (Invitrogen), 1% antibiotic (AAA; Sigma-Aldrich), 10%
FBS (Invitrogen), 20 ng/mL EGF (Sigma-Aldrich), 400 ng/mL
hydrocortisone
(Sigma-Aldrich),
5
mg/mL
insulin
(Sigma-
Aldrich), 50 ng/mL nystatin (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1% amphoter-
icin B (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were passed using 0.05% trypsin/
EDTA (Invitrogen) and used for up to 20 passages. Therefore,
these cells are considered here low-passage primary ACC cells
(instead of established cell lines). UM-HACC-2A is a low passage
cell culture derived from an aggressive primary tumor, and UM-
HACC-2B represents ACC cells derived from the lymph node
metastasis of the same patient. UM-HACC-5 cells were obtained
from a patient that had histologic confirmation of perineural and
bone invasion, and UM-HACC-6 cells were derived from a recur-
rent tumor diagnosed 15 years after initial diagnosis and also
presented perineural invasion. All low passage ACC cell cultures
used here express wild-type p53 (21).
Studies with patient-derived xenograft model of ACC
Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models have been increasing-
ly used in translational cancer research (24). Tumor fragments
from a PDX model of ACC (UM-PDX-HACC-5; refs. 21, 23) at in
vivo passages 5 to 6 were transplanted into the subcutaneous space
of the dorsum of SCID mice (CB.17.SCID; Charles River Labo-
ratories). Tumor volume was calculated using the formula: vol-
ume (mm3) ¼ L � W2/2 (L, length; W, width). All tumors were
surgically retrieved when they reached our UCUCA-approved cut-
off volume of 2,000 mm3. The protocol for animal care was
reviewed and approved by appropriate University of Michigan
institutional committees. Mice transplanted with UM-PDX-
HACC-5 tumors were randomly allocated into four groups
(n ¼ 5–6), maintaining the average of tumor volume (500
mm3/group). Experimental conditions were as follows: vehicle
control (saline, intraperitoneally, weekly); 5 mg/kg cisplatin
(intraperitoneally, weekly); 200 mg/kg MI-773 (gavage, weekly);
or the combination of 5 mg/kg cisplatin þ 200 mg/kg MI-773
regimens. Treatment was administered for 30 days, mice were
followed for additional 24 days, and then mice were euthanized
and tumors retrieved. To compare weekly versus daily regimens
of MI-773 combined with fixed doses of cisplatin, 200 mg/kg
Translational Relevance
Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a relentless form of
salivary gland cancer, typically treated with surgery and radi-
ation, as these tumors are resistant to chemotherapy. In
advanced disease, cisplatin is usually the first treatment
option, but clinical response and long-term efficacy are mod-
est at best. Here, we demonstrate that therapeutic inhibition of
the MDM2–p53 interaction with a small molecule (MI-773)
sensitizes adenoid cystic carcinomas to cisplatin in patient-
derived xenograft (PDX) and low passage primary human ACC
models. Combination of MI-773 and cisplatin mediates
potent and durable tumor regression via p53 reactivation and
tumor cell apoptosis. MI-773 reduces the fraction of cancer
stem cells, which have been associated with resistance to
therapy. Notably, neoadjuvant therapy with MI-773 and cis-
platin eliminated recurrences of PDX ACC tumors for at least
300 days. Collectively, these data suggest that patients with
ACC might benefit from combination therapy with a MDM2–
p53 inhibitor and cisplatin.

 MI-773 was divided into equable daily doses (i.e., 28.5 mg/kg MI-
773). When tumor reached an average volume of 200 mm3,
animals were randomly distributed into the experimental groups
(n ¼ 7–8). Treatment was administered for 14 days, and mice were
followed for additional 44 days, when experiment was terminated
and tumors were collected. To evaluate tumor recurrence, animals
were submitted to a neoadjuvant regimen of MI-773. Briefly, mice
transplanted with UM-PDX-HACC-5 tumors (average volume of
500 mm3) were divided into two groups (n ¼ 8): vehicle control
(polyethylene gycol-200 þ D-a-tocopherol polyethylene glycol
1000 succinate; Sigma-Aldrich) or 200 mg/kg MI-773. Initially,
animals received either a single dose of MI-773 or vehicle. After 7
days, tumors were surgically removed and incisions were closed
with Vetbond (3M). Weekly treatments restarted 7 days after
surgery and continued for 30 days. Then, mice were examined
twice per week for 300 days for signs of recurrence, as defined as
the presence of palpable tumor.
Flow cytometry
Salivary gland CSCs were identified as ALDHhighCD44high cells,
as described previously (25, 26). UM-PDX-HACC-5 tumors were
collected, cut in small pieces, and dissociated using the gentle-
MACS Dissociator Kit (Miltenyi Biotec), incubated in ACK red
blood cell lysis buffer (Invitrogen), and filtered through a 40-mm
sterile cell strainer. Cells were incubated with 5 mL activated
Aldefluor substrate (BAA) or 5 mL aldehyde dehydrogenase
(ALDH) inhibitor (DEAB), using the Aldefluor Kit (Stem Cell
Technologies) for 40 minutes at 37�C. A monoclonal mouse anti-
human CD44 antibody (1:60; APC-cat #559942, PE-cat #550989;
BD Pharmingen) was incubated for 30 minutes at 4�C, and
human cells were separated from murine cells using anti-HLA-
ABC (PE-cat #560168; BD Pharmingen). Viable cells were stained
using 7-AAD (cat #00-6993-50; eBioscience). For cell-cycle anal-
ysis, 5 � 105 UM-HACC-5 or UM-HACC-6 cells were treated with
either vehicle control, MI-773, and/or cisplatin diluted in salivary
gland medium for 24 hours. After harvesting, cells were fixed in
70% cold ethanol and exposed to 0.1% sodium citrate, 25 mg/mL
propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 mg/mL RNase A, and
0.1% Triton X-100. Flow cytometry (FACSCalibur; BD Bios-
ciences) was carried out to quantify the percentage of cells in
each cell-cycle phase (G0–G1, S. and G2–M), as described previ-
ously (23). Data were obtained from triplicates and represent at
least three independent experiments. Results were analyzed using
FlowJo software (FlowJo, LLC).
Subcellular fractionation
Cytoplasmic and cellular membrane portions were separated
from the nucleus, as described previously (27). Briefly, UM-
HACC-5 cells were treated with vehicle control, Cisplatin and/or
MI-773 for 24 hours. Then, cells were resuspended in cytoplasmic
extraction buffer (Panomics) and incubated for 3 minutes on ice.
The suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 minutes at
4�C. Supernatant was collected as cytoplasmic/cell membrane
extract. The remaining pellet was resuspended in nuclear extrac-
tion buffer (Panomics) with occasional vortexing during 40
minutes. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected as
nuclear extract.
Western blots
Protein lysates from UM-PDX-HACC-5 tumors, UM-HACC-5,
and UM-HACC-6 cells were prepared using 1% Nonidet P-40
(NP-40) lysis buffer and loaded onto 9% to 12% SDS-PAGE gels.
Membranes were incubated with the following primary antibo-
dies overnight at 4�C: mouse anti-human p53 (1:1,000), b-actin
conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP; 1:100,000), rabbit
anti-hnRNP (1:1,000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); hamster anti-
human Bcl-2 (1:500), rabbit anti-human phospho-p53 (S392;
1:1,000), p21 (1:2,000), BAX (1:500), PUMA (1:500), cleaved-
caspase 9 (1:1,000) (Cell Signaling Technology); mouse anti-
human MDM2 (1:500; Thermo Fisher Scientific); rabbit anti-
human Bcl-xL (1:500; BD Biosciences), or mouse anti-GAPDH
(1:1,000,000; Chemicon). Membranes were exposed to affinity-
purified secondary antibodies (1:1,000) conjugated with HRP
(The Jackson Laboratory), and immunoreactive proteins were
visualized by SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate
(Thermo Scientific).
Cytotoxicity assays
Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assays were performed to evaluate the
effect of treatment on ACC cell viability, as described previously
(23). Here, 2 � 103 UM-HACC-5 and UM-HACC-6 cells per well
were exposed to vehicle, MI-773, and/or cisplatin for 24 to 96
hours. After fixation with 10% cold trichloroacetic acid for 1 hour
at 4�C, viable cells were stained by addition of 0.4% SRB dye
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 minutes at room temperature. The excess
unbound dye was removed by 1% acetic acid. SRB-stained cells
were resolubilized in 10 mmol/L unbuffered Tris base, and plates
were read in a microplate reader at 560 nm (GENios, Tecan).
Results were normalized by vehicle control and IC50 values were
determined. Data were obtained from quadruplicate wells/con-
dition and represent at least three independent experiments.
Fluorometric assay
UM-HACC-5, -6 cells were treated with IC50 concentrations of
MI-773, cisplatin, or vehicle control for 24 hours. Cell pellets were
resuspended in lysis buffer, and cells were incubated with 1
mmol/L IETD-AFC (caspase-8 substrate; Enzo) or 1 mmol/L
LEHD-AFC (caspase-9 substrate; Enzo) for up to 2 hours at 37�C.
Samples were analyzed in a microplate reader at 400 nm
(GENios).
Statistical analyses
Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA, followed by post hoc
tests (Tukey) for multiple comparisons or Student t test, when
indicated. Regression modeling was performed using mixed effect
linear regression to account for repeated measures on each tumor.
The tumor volume data was log transformed to account for
exponential growth. Model fixed effects included time, cisplatin
treatment, and MI-773 treatment, and tumor starting size. Ran-
dom effects included mouse. We assumed an autoregressive
correlation structure where more proximate time values have a
higher degree of correlation. When comparing different dosing
schemas, each dosing category was included as a different factor
level in the regression model. Predictions curves were generated
directly from the regression model. Kaplan–Meier graphs were
analyzed by the Gehan–Breslow–Wilcoxon test. Failure criterion
was a 2-fold increase in tumor volume (for tumor growth anal-
ysis) or presence of palpable tumor (for recurrence analysis).
Significance level (a) was determined at P < 0.05. Analysis was
performed using the "survival" and "gls" packages in software
program, version R 3.1.0.

 Results
MI-773 sensitizes ACC PDX tumors to cisplatin
To begin to understand the effect of combining MI-773 with
cisplatin in vivo, we performed a pilot study to evaluate drug
toxicity. Using published studies as reference, we choose weekly
doses of 5 mg/kg cisplatin (22) and 200 mg/kg MI-773 (21) for
this experiment. Weight loss did not exceed 20% (compared with
pretreatment values), which is our UCUCA-approved cutoff for
systemic toxicities, when we used single-agent cisplatin or MI-773
or combination of both drugs (Supplementary Fig. S1). To eval-
uate the effect of MI-773 and/or cisplatin on UM-HACC-PDX-5
tumors, we allowed tumors to grow to an average volume of 500
mm3 and then began treating mice with the same doses men-
tioned above for 30 days (Fig. 1). We observed that MI-773 as a
single agent causes tumor regression, being more effective than
single-agent cisplatin (Fig. 1A and C). Cisplatin therapy shows
limited therapeutic response, stabilizing the tumor growth, but
not causing PDX tumor regression, as reported in humans (6–9).
However, combination of MI-773 and cisplatin was more effec-
tive than single-agent therapy. There was no tumor rebound upon
termination of treatment within the duration of the follow-up in
this initial experiment (about 20 days posttreatment; Fig. 1A).
Importantly, mice did not show weight loss beyond the 20%
cutoff (Fig. 1B). We performed linear mixed effect regression
modeling on the tumor volume to account for repeated measures
on each tumor and determine the effects of time, cisplatin treat-
ment, MI-773 treatment, and starting tumor size on tumor vol-
ume. The rate of tumor growth was significantly less in MI-773
(P ¼ 0.0002) and cisplatin (P ¼ 0.0017) groups when compared
with control (Fig. 1C). Western blot analysis from UM-HACC-
PDX-5 tumors shows that therapeutic inhibition of MDM2,
combined or not with cisplatin, causes the upregulation of p53
and MDM2 expression (Fig. 1D). MI-773–activated p53 is func-
tional in vivo, as confirmed by the upregulation of its downstream
protein p21 and the apoptosis effector protein BAX. In contrast,
PUMA appears to be primarily regulated by cisplatin, while the
prosurvival protein Bcl-2 did not show considerable changes in
expression levels upon treatment. Collectively, these in vivo results
Figure 1.

 demonstrate that MI-773 mediates ACC tumor regression in a
preclinical model of ACC.
Effect of MI-773 and/or cisplatin on ACC cell proliferation and
survival
To evaluate the therapeutic potential of each drug in vitro,
low passage primary human ACC cells (UM-HACC-5 and UM-
HACC-6) were treated with either a dose range of MI-773 (0.01–
10 mmol/L) or cisplatin (0.02–20 mmol/L). Alternatively, cells
were treated with a fixed dose of cisplatin (2 mmol/L) together
with increasing concentrations of MI-773. The percentage of
viable cells was determined by SRB assay. Data were normalized
against vehicle control. We observed a dose- and time-dependent
cytotoxic response in both ACC primary cells evaluated. IC50
values for single agent were in the low micromolar range, and
for both ACC cells, the IC50 for MI-773 was about half concen-
tration as compared with the IC50 for cisplatin (Fig. 2A). Com-
bination of both agents further reduced the IC50 to 0.73 mmol/L
(UM-HACC-5) and 3.79 mmol/L (UM-HACC-6) at 72 hours (Fig.
2A). Representative photomicrographs of cells in culture condi-
tions were taken after 72 hours of treatment using intermediate
doses of single or combined drugs regimens (1–2 mmol/L; Sup-
plementary Fig. S2B). To better understand the mechanisms
associated with the antitumor effect observed in vivo, UM-PDX-
HACC-5 tissue slides were stained for in situ TUNEL to reveal cells
undergoing apoptosis (Fig. 2B). The percentage of TUNEL-positive
cellsissignificantlyhigher(P < 0.05)inanimalsthatreceived either
MI-773 or cisplatin (Fig. 2B and C). Combination therapy induced
more apoptosis than cisplatin or MI-773 used as a single agent
(Fig. 2C). In addition, we evaluated the effect of treatment on cell
cycle. UM-HACC-5 or UM-HACC-6 cells were treated for 24 hours
using low concentrations of either MI-773 and/or cisplatin (1–2
mmol/L), and the percentage of cells in each cell-cycle phase was
determined by flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. S3). MI-773
causes cell-cycle arrest at the first checkpoint (G1); a similar trend is
seen upon drugcombination therapy. As previously reported (28),
themajorityof cells exposed to cisplatin are retained in theS-phase
(Fig. 2D). Taken together, these results indicate that antitumor cell
effects seen upon treatment with MI-773 and/or cisplatin involve
cell-cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis.
Inhibition of the MDM2–p53 interaction with MI-773 activates
p53
To better understand the role of MI-773 on p53 activation in
ACC, we first performed Western blot analysis for the basal
expression of MDM2 and apoptosis-related proteins (i.e., Bcl-xL
and Bcl-2) in UM-HACC-2A, UM-HACC-2B, UM-HACC-5, and
UM-HACC-6 cells (Fig. 3A). Next, we treated ACC cells with
single-agent MI-773 or cisplatin at intermediate doses (1–2
mmol/L) and observed that p53, MDM2, p21, BAX, and PUMA
(except for UM-HACC-6 cells) expression is increased with MI-
773, while Bcl-2 expression was slightly decreased upon treatment
with cisplatin (Fig. 3B). Then, we evaluated more closely the
expression of p53 in UM-HACC-PDX-5 tumors from experiment
reported in Fig. 1. Tumors treated with either vehicle or cisplatin
show nuclear localization of p53. Surprisingly, the administration
of MI-773 as a single agent or combined with cisplatin causes a
partial translocation of p53 to the cytoplasm (Fig. 3C). To confirm
this apparent translocation of p53, we exposed UM-HACC-5
cells to low concentrations of MI-773 and/or cisplatin (0.1–0.2
mmol/L). After 24 hours, we performed a subcellular fractionation
assay to separate the nucleus compartment from the cytoplasm/
membrane components. Confirming the data obtained by IHC,
tumors exposed to MI-773 alone or in combination with cisplatin
presented p53 in both nucleus and cytoplasm. MI-773 caused a
robust increase in MDM2 expression, which was observed in both
the nuclear and the cytoplasmic extract (Fig. 3D). Immunofluo-
rescence further confirmed the cytoplasmic presence of p53 upon
treatment with MI-773 (Fig. 3E).
To further understand the effect of MI-773 or cisplatin on ACC
cells, we performed a series of dose- and time-dependent experi-
ments (Fig. 4). MI-773 induces activation of phospho-p53 (SER
392), p53, MDM2, p21, BAX, and PUMA in a dose-dependent
manner, with visible effects already being observed with 0.1
mmol/L in both cell lines (Fig. 4A). The prosurvival protein Bcl-xL
appears to be upregulated by low concentration MI-773 in both
ACC cells and went down to baseline levels at 10 mmol/L (Fig. 4A).
Cisplatin requires higher doses for the activation of p53, MDM2,
p21, and BAX when compared with MI-773 (Fig. 4A and B). The
activation of BAX by cisplatin appears to be associated with Bcl-xL
downregulation and does not involve PUMA regulation, which
differs from MI-773 treatment.
In a time course evaluation with intermediate dose of MI-773
(1 mmol/L), p53 and p21 were constantly activated over 96 hours,
while the expression of MDM2 increased with time particularly in
UM-HACC-6 cells (Fig. 4C). Upon cisplatin treatment (2 mmol/L),
the peak of p53 activation was at 48 hours in UM-HACC-5 cells;
the same trend was observed for MDM2. In UM-HACC-6 cells,
p53 activation was constant, but MDM2 expression increased over
time (Fig. 4D). To better understand the effect of drugs together,
we designed an experiment to evaluate the effect of minimal doses
of MI-773 and cisplatin on p53 and MDM2. We observed that MI-
773 appears to be the dominant factor driving p53 and MDM2
expression when used in combination with cisplatin in the four
low passage ACC cell cultures tested here (Fig. 4E). Collectively,
these results demonstrate that MI-773 induces p53, MDM2, and
p21 expression via a mechanism that is associated with upregula-
tion of Bax and PUMA. To further understand the mechanisms
involved in MI-773–induced apoptosis, we performed fluoromet-
ric assays. They revealed that caspase-9 (but not caspase-8) is
activated upon treatment of ACC cells with MI-773 and/or cis-
platin (Fig. 4G). Of note, the activation of caspase-9 in UM-
HACC-5 cells treated with MI-773 þ cisplatin (120 minutes) is
5.94-fold higher than vehicle control, and in UM-HACC-6, it is
6.76-fold higher than vehicle (Fig. 4G). These data indicate that
this drug combination is equally effective in both ACC cell
cultures. Western blots were used to verify the data obtained with
the fluorometric assay and confirmed that treatment with MI-773
and/or cisplatin induces expression of cleaved (active) caspase-9
(Fig. 4F).
Dosing and frequency of MI-773 determines efficacy
To further explore the antitumor effect of the combined ther-
apy, we designed an independent experiment evaluating weekly
versus daily regimens of MI-773 combined with fixed doses of
cisplatin. When UM-HACC-PDX-5 tumors reached the average
volume of 200 mm3, mice were randomly divided into 5 groups
(n ¼ 7–8), and treatment was administered for 14 days (Fig. 5). A
shorter treatment period was chosen here to focus the evaluation
on the posttreatment period. Here, we observed that single drugs,
MI-773 or cisplatin, stabilize tumor volume during treatment,
but ACC tumor growth resumed as soon as treatment was

 discontinued (Fig. 5A). When MI-773 and cisplatin were com-
bined, daily and weekly MI-773 regimens caused tumor regres-
sion. Remarkably, weekly MI-773 combined with cisplatin had a
much more prolonged antitumor effect than daily MI-773 com-
bined with cisplatin, even though the total amount of MI-773
administered in both groups was exactly the same (Fig. 5A).
Importantly, none of the treatment regimens resulted in mouse
weight loss beyond the 20% cutoff (Fig. 5B). We again performed
a linear mixed effect model to evaluate the tumor growth rate over
time, now including each dosing strategy as a different factor level.
We performed multivariate regression to determine the differ-
ences in growth rates between the different treatment approaches.
In a model including initial tumor size, overall growth rate, and
cisplatin treatment, treatment with MI-773 weekly (P < 0.0001),
but not daily (P ¼ 0.6365), decreased the tumor growth rate (Fig.

 criterion for "event" a 2-fold increase in tumor volume as com-
pared with pretreatment size. MI-773, cisplatin, and daily doses of
MI-773 combined with cisplatin extended time to failure signif-
icantly as compared with vehicle control (P < 0.05). Notably,
weekly MI-773 combined with cisplatin significantly extended
time to failure when compared with daily MI-773 combined with
cisplatin (P ¼ 0.0042; Fig. 5D). Scatter plot graph was generated to
depict tumor volume after 10 days of treatment (Fig. 5E). After 57
days, tumors were collected and processed for protein analysis. As
previously noticed (Fig. 1D), therapeutic inhibition of MDM2 by
MI-773, as a single agent or combined with cisplatin, causes
upregulation of p53, MDM2, and p21 (Fig. 5F). Both daily and
weekly combined treatments cause upregulation of apoptosis-
related proteins BAX and PUMA. Taken together, the results
suggest that weekly MI-773 combined with cisplatin is the pref-
erable treatment schedule in preclinical models of ACC.
Therapeutic inhibition of the MDM2–p53 interaction reduces
the fraction of CSCs and prevents recurrence of PDX ACC
tumors
It is known that ALDH activity and CD44 expression can be used
to identify CSCs in salivary gland tumors (23–26). To elucidate the
impact of MI-773 and/or cisplatin treatment on ACC CSCs, mice
harboring UM-HACC-PDX-5 tumors were divided in 4 groups
(n ¼ 5) and received MI-773 (200 mg/kg) for one week, combined
or not with two single doses of cisplatin (at the first and seventh
day; Fig. 6A). Two days after completion of treatment, tumors were
retrieved and the proportion of CSCs was analyzed by flow
cytometry. Notably, MI-773 alone (or in combination with cis-
platin) decreased the fraction of CSCs (ALDHhighCD44high) when
compared with cisplatin alone or vehicle control (P < 0.05; Fig. 6B
and C). Immunofluorescence for ALDH1 suggested the presence of
alargernumberofALDH1-positivecellsinthevehicleandcisplatin
groups, particularly in close proximity to blood vessels and nerves
(Supplementary Fig. S4). These findings suggest the existence of
perivascular niches for CSCs in ACC, as it has been described for
other tumors (29, 30).
It has been postulated that CSCs play an important role in
tumor progression, particularly toward locoregional recurrence
and/or metastases (31–33). In an attempt to mimic a clinical trial,
we treated mice harboring UM-HACC-PDX-5 tumors (n ¼ 8) with
a neoadjuvant regimen of MI-773, followed by complete surgical
resection of the tumor (Fig. 6D). Confirming data described
above, a single dose of 200 mg/kg MI-773 significantly decreases
the proportion of CSCs (Fig. 6E). Upon follow-up for 300 days
(approximately half of the lifetime of a mouse), we observed that
5 (out of 8) mice from the control group presented tumor
recurrence (Fig. 6F). Remarkably, not a single mouse from the
MI-773–treated group presented tumor recurrence during this
experimental period (Fig. 6F and G).
Discussion
ACCs are resistant to all conventional chemotherapeutic drugs
available today. As a consequence, treatment for patients with this
cancer is largely limited to surgery and radiation. The develop-
ment of a safe and effective therapy is therefore urgently needed. It
is known that MDM2 is overexpressed in ACCs (17, 18). We have
recently demonstrated that therapeutic inhibition of the MDM2–
p53 interaction with MI-773 mediates short-term antitumor effect
in preclinical models of ACC (21). Here, for the first time, we show
that MI-773 reduces the fraction of ACC cancer stem cells, sensi-
tizes ACC PDXs to cisplatin, and prevents tumor recurrence when
used in a neoadjuvant setting.
Mechanisms associated with cancer progression often involve
inactivation in p53 tumor suppressor functions, and MDM2 is a
common mechanism to inhibit p53 activity (13–16). We dem-
onstrated here that the reactivation of p53 by MI-773 causes a cell-
cycle arrest and induces apoptosis of ACC cells. Interestingly, we
observed here a partial translocation of p53 from the nucleus to
the cytoplasm. Green andKroemer (34)discussed thecytoplasmic
functions of p53 in mitochondrial outer membrane permeabili-
zation–mediated apoptosis. They propose that PUMA (p53-upre-
gulated modulator of apoptosis), a target of nuclear p53, disrupts
the Bcl-xL–p53 interaction in the cytoplasm. Thus, p53 is released
and forms a complex with BAX, initiating the caspase-dependent
apoptotic pathway. Here, we observed the upregulation of BAX in
ACC xenograft tumors treated with MI-773 as a single agent or
combined to cisplatin. Cisplatin, in turn, was capable of Bcl-2
downregulation in UM-HACC-5 cells. The complementary
mechanisms of action of MI-773 and cisplatin might explain the
potentiation of the antitumor effect that was observed here when
both drugs are used together in vivo.
It has been shown that the combination of MI-319 (an alternate
small-molecule inhibitor of MDM2 from the class as MI-773)
with cisplatin suppressed cell growth, colony formation, and
induced apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells (35). Another study
showed that combination of cisplatin with Nutlin-3a, a different
class of MDM2 inhibitor, enhanced apoptosis and reverted cis-
platin resistance in ovarian cancer cells (36). Interestingly, the
inhibition of MDM2–p53 interaction was able to radiosensitize
tumor cells in a wide range of cancers types (e.g., lung, breast,
colorectal, melanoma, and sarcoma; ref. 37). Our work demon-
strated the therapeutic benefit of MI-773 and cisplatin combina-
tion in ACCs and offered a new hypothesis to explain the anti-
tumor effect of this drug combination, that is, the ablation of
CSCs. In addition, we demonstrated here that MI-773 decreases
the risk of locoregional recurrence in preclinical models, which is
likely associated with its effect on eliminating at least in part the
highly tumorigenic CSCs.
The long-term prognosis of patients with ACC is directly
affected by late episodes of recurrence and/or metastases (10).
In head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, resistance to
chemotherapy and recurrence has been associated with CSCs
(22, 29, 38). This small population of uniquely tumorigenic cells
was also found in salivary gland tumors (25, 26), but their
sensitivity to chemotherapy is not understood. Here, we observed
that cisplatin did not have a significant effect on the fraction of
CSCs in ACC xenograft tumors. In contrast, MI-773 significantly
reduced the fraction of CSCs when compared with cisplatin or
vehicle control. This finding raises a putative hypothesis to explain
the long-term antitumor effect of this drug combination in vivo,
that is, MI-773 targets the CSCs (resistant to cisplatin) that have
been shown to be mediators of tumor recurrence and/or metas-
tases (33, 33). Indeed, when we exposed mice to a neoadjuvant
treatment of MI-773 (i.e., a single dose of MI-773 followed by
surgical removal of the tumor, and a subsequent MI-773 therapy
for 30 days), we confirmed the reduction of CSCs in the excised
tumors. Notably, no recurrence was observed in mice treated with
MI-773 even after 300 days of follow-up (about half of the
lifetime of mice), while more than half of the mice that received
vehicle presented recurrent tumors.

 In conclusion, this work demonstrated that therapeutic inhi-
bition of the MDM2–p53 interaction with MI-773 is an effective
antitumor strategy that mediates ACC tumor regression, reduces
the fraction of CSCs, sensitizes xenograft tumors to cisplatin, and
prevents tumor recurrence in preclinical models of ACC. These
preclinical data provide the conceptual framework for an early
