Objective: To formulate clinical practice guidelines for the use of continuous glucose monitoring
and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in adults with diabetes.
Participants:TheparticipantsincludeanEndocrineSociety-appointedTaskForceofsevenexperts,ameth-
odologist,andamedicalwriter.TheAmericanAssociationforClinicalChemistry,theAmericanAssociation
of Diabetes Educators, and the European Society of Endocrinology co-sponsored this guideline.
Evidence: The Task Force developed this evidence-based guideline using the Grading of Recom-
mendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system to describe the strength of recom-
mendations and the quality of evidence. The Task Force commissioned one systematic review and
used the best available evidence from other published systematic reviews and individual studies.
Consensus Process: One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications
enabled consensus. Committees and members of the Endocrine Society, the American Association
for Clinical Chemistry, the American Association of Diabetes Educators, and the European Society
of Endocrinology reviewed and commented on preliminary drafts of these guidelines.
Conclusions: Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and continuous glucose monitoring have
an important role in the treatment of diabetes. Data from randomized controlled trials are limited

Method of Development of Evidence-
Based Clinical Practice Guidelines
The Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee (CGS) of the En-
docrine Society deemed diabetes technology a priority
area in need of practice guidelines and appointed a Task
Force to formulate evidence-based recommendations. The
Task Force followed the approach recommended by the
Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Develop-
ment, and Evaluation group, an international group with
expertise in the development and implementation of evi-
dence-based guidelines (1). A detailed description of the
grading scheme has been published elsewhere (2). The
Task Force used the best available research evidence to
develop the recommendations. The Task Force also used
consistent language and graphical descriptions of both the
strength of a recommendation and the quality of evidence.
In terms of the strength of the recommendation, strong
recommendations use the phrase “we recommend” and
the number 1, and weak recommendations use the phrase
“we suggest” and the number 2. Cross-filled circles indi-
cate the quality of the evidence, such that QEEE denotes
very low quality evidence; QQEE, low quality; QQQE,
moderate quality; and QQQQ, high quality. The Task
Force has confidence that persons who receive care ac-
cording to the strong recommendations will derive, on
average, more good than harm. Weak recommendations
require more careful consideration of the person’s circum-
stances, values, and preferences to determine the best
course of action. Linked to each recommendation is a de-
scriptionoftheevidenceandthevaluesthattheTaskForce
considered in making the recommendation; in some in-
stances, there are remarks, a section in which the Task
Force offers technical suggestions for testing conditions,
dosing, and monitoring. These technical comments reflect
the best available evidence applied to a typical person be-
ing treated. Often this evidence comes from the unsystem-
atic observations of the Task Force and their values and
preferences; therefore, one should consider these remarks
as suggestions.
In this guideline, the Task Force made several state-
ments to emphasize the importance of shared decision-

attention and remind providers of these principles; one
should not consider these statements as graded recom-
mendations (3).
The Endocrine Society maintains a rigorous conflict-
of-interest review process for developing clinical practice
guidelines. All Task Force members must declare any po-
tential conflicts of interest by completing a conflict-of-
interest form. The CGS reviews all conflicts of interest
before the Society’s Council approves the members to par-
ticipate on the Task Force and periodically during the de-
velopment of the guideline. All others participating in the
guideline’sdevelopmentmustalsodiscloseanyconflictsof
interest in the matter under study, and a majority of these
participants must be without any conflicts of interest. The
CGS and the Task Force have reviewed all disclosures for
this guideline and resolved or managed all identified con-
flicts of interest.
Conflicts of interest are defined as remuneration in any
amount from commercial interests; grants; research sup-
port; consulting fees; salary; ownership interests (eg,
stocks and stock options [excluding diversified mutual

tors; and all other financial benefits. Completed forms are
available through the Endocrine Society office.
The Endocrine Society provided all funding for this
guideline; the Task Force received no funding or remu-
neration from commercial or other entities.
Commissioned systematic review
The Task Force commissioned a systematic review and
individual patient data meta-analysis of randomized con-
trolled trials (RCTs) that enrolled individuals with T1DM
and compared RT-CGM versus control groups. A two-
step regression model was used to pool individual patient
data, which came from trial lists and device manufactur-
ers. Pooled data from 11 RCTs suggested that the use of
RT-CGM was associated with a significant reduction in
A1C (�0.276; 95% confidence interval, �0.465 to
�0.087). The improvements in A1C were primarily seen
in ages � 15 years. There was no statistically significant
difference in time spent in hypoglycemia or the number of
hypoglycemic episodes, although these analyses were im-
precise and warrant lower confidence. There was no dif-
ference between males and females.
Introduction
The goal of glucose management in all types of diabetes
is to minimize and hopefully eliminate the acute and
chronic complications associated with diabetes, such as
the risks of microvascular complications and potentially
(to a lesser degree) macrovascular complications and mor-
tality (4–9). All persons with T1DM require insulin, and
persons with T2DM frequently need insulin for adequate
glucose control. Patients requiring intensive insulin ther-
apy take insulin as needed, adjusting both basal and pran-
dial doses to reach specific glucose goals (10). However,
intensificationincreasestheriskofhypoglycemia,whichis
associated with both morbidity and mortality. Advances
in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of insu-
lin products and in the methods of insulin delivery and
glucose monitoring are geared toward improving glucose
control, minimizing hypoglycemia, and improving quality
of life. Two such advances include CSII and CGM. And
whereas these and other new technologies hold the poten-
tial for enhancing outcomes and improving quality of life
for people with diabetes, reliable data on the efficacy of
new advances is lacking. This is due in part because the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates med-
ical devices less rigorously than it regulates pharmaceuti-
cals, which lessens the demand for large clinical trials com-
paring one device to another. Of the studies that do exist,
many include devices that are outdated or obsolete at the
time of publication and thus do not reflect current tech-
nologies. This guideline attempts to assess all available
data on existing and emerging technologies and proce-
dures for improving glucose control for patients with
diabetes.
Important to note, success of these devices and tech-
nologies is directly linked to the level to which people are
educated, capable, and willing to use them. Patients on
CSII therapy, as well as MDI of insulin, can have inade-
quate glucose control. Therefore, in every stage of this
guideline we stress the need for patient and practitioner
education and training in conjunction with clearly defined
processes for patient follow-up, analysis of device data,
and access to care (should a problem arise). Finally, hu-
man factors relating to the use of these technologies are as
important as other considerations in device development,
although in many cases true effectiveness data are lacking
(11).
Clinicians began developing CSII therapy as early as
1963, and it gained increasing general acceptance in the
1980s. This was in part due to the Diabetes Control and
Complications Trial, which compared CSII with MDI in
patients with T1DM. The trial lasted from 1982 to 1993
and placed roughly 40% of patients on CSII and the re-
maining patients on MDI (12). Results showed that pa-

 tients treated with CSII had a slightly lower A1C mean
relative to patients treated with MDI. These results, how-
ever, do not necessarily apply to today’s diabetes patients
because the last 30 years have seen many technological
improvements in insulin products and pump technologies,
and the use of insulin pumps has grown dramatically (pri-
marily for treating T1DM). Despite these improvements,
comprehensive reliable data are lacking on the number of
people with T1DM and the number of people who use
insulin pumps who have T1DM. Likewise, data are lack-
ing that demonstrate a clear superiority of CSII over MDI.
This is due to a general lack of studies and is confounded
by the ongoing development of newer insulin analogs and
advanced glucose monitoring and insulin delivery tech-
nologies, making comparisons between studies complex.
However, diabetes specialists have confidence in pump
therapy, despite its greater expense. The T1D Exchange, a
registry of diabetes specialty clinics in the United States,
reported in 2012 that 56% of the adult T1DM patients in
these clinics were using CSII and had lower A1C levels
than those using MDI (13).
Early pumps were heavy, crude syringe pumps with
suboptimal quality control, inadequate battery power,
and limited dosing flexibility that used infusion sets with
rigid needles. The modern age of CSII use in the clinical
setting began in the 1980s with new manufacturers enter-
ing the market and significant technological advances. To-
day, there are five FDA-approved pumps available in the
United States providing numerous features to improve ac-
curacy, safety, dosing decisions, convenience, and overall
usability (14). This guideline only reviewed pumps that
allow for multiple basal rates and use bolus dose calcula-
tors. We feel there is insufficient research evidence and
experience to include single-basal-rate pumps or bolus-
onlypumps(CalibraFinesse)inthisanalysis.Finally,these
guidelines are meant for individuals using rapid-acting an-
alog (RAA) insulin in their pumps (although we do men-
tion U-500 insulin).
There are few professional organization recommenda-
tions or guidelines related to CSII (15–17). The latest stan-
dards of care from the American Diabetes Association
simply say that clinicians should treat most people with
T1DM with MDI or CSII (10).
CGM is a more recently developed device for managing
diabetes. For years, clinicians have used standard capillary
blood glucose measurements (self-monitoring blood glu-
cose [SMBG]) to guide therapy; however, these discrete
values offer only a limited perspective on the constant
daily changes in blood glucose levels, do not provide
alarms that indicate when blood glucose levels are above
or below various thresholds, and do not indicate trends in
blood glucose levels. Current models of CGM measure the
glucose concentration in the interstitial fluid, and devices
are evolving steadily in terms of accuracy and ease of use.
We reviewed the data regarding current CGM devices,
giving specific consideration to more recent device tech-
nology. We excluded devices designed for intensive care
units and the Abbott Libre system, which, although
unique in terms of its claim as strip replacement without
the need for calibration, does not provide true CGM in
terms of providing alerts for high and low blood glucose
levels.

MDI in patients with T1DM who have not achieved their
A1C goal, as long as the patient and caregivers are willing
and able to use the device. (1�QQQE)
Evidence
The alternative therapy for T1DM is basal-bolus ther-
apy with a RAA insulin and a basal analog insulin (10).
Unfortunately, many of the comparative effectiveness tri-
als for pumps took place before these modern analogs
(which are associated with less hypoglycemia) were avail-
able (18). Some studies compared CSII using RAA vs MDI
using non-analog or a mixture of insulin types; however,
this is not directly applicable to current MDI regimens,
which primarily use analog insulin. Continual advance-
ments in pump design have also complicated analysis. The
user interface, size, and shape, and bolus calculators on
pumps are evolving, as is data communication (eg, via
CGM, meters, Internet). The added benefit of advance-
ments in pump design would be obscured in a meta-anal-
ysis of multiple studies that also included outdated pumps.
Finally, double-blind trials are not possible because indi-
viduals would be aware of their assigned treatment.
Given these limitations, however, a couple of meta-
analyses have reviewed the small number of comparative
effectiveness RCTs of therapies for T1DM in adults (18–
23). The 2010 Cochrane Review of CSII in T1DM found
a statistically significant reduction in A1C of 0.3% in
those adults treated with CSII (19). However, that review
included many studies completed before 2000 with pumps
that used regular insulin. Due to the changes in available
insulin and the technological changes in pumps, the most
relevant systematic reviews are those evaluating studies
reported over the last 15 years with pumps that used
RAAs. The most recent meta-analysis by Yeh et al (20)
only included studies that used RAA and only found four
qualifying trials. They again found a significant benefit to
CSII with a reduction in A1C of 0.3% compared to MDI.
However, the results were significantly influenced by the

 largest study that found a reduction in A1C of 0.84% with
CSII; however, this was also the study with the highest
randomization A1C (9.3% mean) (24). This 16-week
study was intended to be a 32-week crossover trial, but the
authors only reported the first phase due to a high dropout
rate at the time of crossover. Despite this significant flaw,
this study was unique in that it included a 14-week “qual-
ification phase” to randomize only patients who com-
pleted at least 70% of the recommended glucose moni-
toring. There is no evidence that other studies took
measures to identify patients for inclusion who were sim-
ilarly motivated. Only one of the reported studies was of
more than 16 weeks in duration. In a small 9-month study,
Tsui et al (25) reported that baseline A1C was approxi-
mately 0.5% higher in the MDI group, although they said
it represented a nonsignificant difference. None of the
studies in the Yeh et al (20) analysis used a bolus dose
calculator, although one of the studies included a pump
that did have that feature available (26). This study was
the only one that used a modern basal insulin (glargine).
A 5-week crossover design study using CGM reported
that the area under the curve for glucose levels over 140
mg/dL was reduced by 40% in T1DM patients on CSII of
insulin aspart vs MDI of insulin aspart/insulin glargine
(27). Fructosamine reduction was also highly significant
with CSII vs MDI.
Observational studies performed at clinics with signif-
icant insulin pump experience and carefully applied pro-
tocols of patient selection and education suggest that glu-
cose control may be better in these clinics vs research
settings where patient inclusion criteria are variable and
rarely optimized for ideal candidates. For example, a re-
cent observational study of 200 adults with T1DM tran-
sitioned to CSII from MDI demonstrated that in these
poorly controlled patients, CSII reduced A1C by a mean
of � 1.0% and maintained a significant improvement for
the average 6 years of follow-up (28). RCTs do not con-
sistently utilize (and meta-analyses do not typically ana-
lyze) the selection criterion, educational approach, or on-
going evaluation and support that experienced clinicians
and clinics implement. We describe in detail what defines
a reasonable pump candidate below (4. Selection of can-
didates for insulin pump therapy).
Despite the limitations of the available literature, there
is relatively consistent evidence that current CSII is likely
to improve glucose control in motivated patients with in-
adequate glucose control who are appropriately educated
and supported. Because this area of insulin treatment tech-
nology is progressing in the direction of sensor augmen-
tation, it is unlikely that we will see meaningful studies
evaluatingtheisolatedbenefitofCSIIthatwilladvancethe
present body of evidence.

MDI in patients with T1DM who have achieved their A1C
goal but continue to experience severe hypoglycemia or
high glucose variability, as long as the patient and care-
givers are willing and able to use the device. (1�QQEE)
Evidence
Data on the reduction of hypoglycemia are mixed and
difficult to analyze with systematic reviews due to variable
study definitions of hypoglycemia and variable patterns of
monitoring to detect overall or nocturnal hypoglycemia
(19, 20). On balance, there is no good evidence that CSII
reduces overall hypoglycemia in patients with T1DM.
Most comparative trials of CSII vs MDI have excluded
patients experiencing severe hypoglycemia (usually de-
fined as requiring assistance) in the months before entry
into the study (19, 22). In studies where these patients are
specified,meta-analysisshowsthatseverehypoglycemiais
significantly reduced on CSII compared to MDI, although
these studies used insulin regimens that are outdated (29).
There is also evidence that CSII is associated with re-
duced glucose variability (30–33). This is important be-
cause variability is one of the primary indications for CSII
in some clinics (34). Furthermore, higher variability is of-
ten associated with more hypoglycemia, and there is an
unproven concern that variability may have an indepen-
dent effect on complications (35).
1.3 We suggest CSII in patients with T1DM who re-
quire increased insulin delivery flexibility or improved sat-
isfaction and are capable of using the device. (2�QQEE)
Evidence
As noted above, there is no evidence from systematic
reviews that indicates inferior glucose control with CSII
relative to MDI (19, 21, 36). Therefore, expanded CSII use
is limited by higher cost and marginal benefit, unless there
are other advantages beyond glucose control. The flexi-
bility provided by CSII with RAA insulin could be an ad-
vantage for those who exercise and potentially those with
gastroparesis because the basal delivery dose and pattern
can be modified (37–41). A case series of patients with
gastroparesis who converted from MDI to CSII showed
fewer hospitalizations, improved A1C, and less glucose
variability (41). However, there are no RCTs supporting
this potential benefit. Many studies have demonstrated
improved quality of life or improved patient satisfaction
with CSII therapy relative to MDI therapy, some of which
may be due to improvements in glycemic control. How-
ever,apatient’sattitudetowarddifferenttechnologiesand
methods of implementation, while significant, is not easily

 Unfortunately, various studies used different measure-
ment tools or reported on different specific categorical
findings (42). Therefore, whereas almost all positive find-
ings are in favor of CSII, the inconsistencies provide lim-
ited clarity in meta-analysis (20, 24–26, 32, 43, 44).
2. Insulin pump therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus
2.1 We suggest CSII with good adherence to monitor-
ing and dosing in patients with T2DM who have poor
glycemic control despite intensive insulin therapy, oral
agents, other injectable therapy, and lifestyle modifica-
tions. (2�QQEE)
Evidence
Although several uncontrolled studies have reported
that T2DM patients treated with CSII have improved glu-
cose control and patient-reported outcomes, RCTs have
shown mixed results, and subsequent meta-analyses have
failed to show significant reductions of A1C or reductions
in hypoglycemia for T2DM patients on CSII (20, 22, 45–
51). Additionally, the older studies did not compare CSII
to MDI using insulin analogs. A recent RCT of 331 T2DM
patients on MDI randomized to CSII or MDI using analog
insulin reported a statistically superior reduction in A1C
of1.1%fromthebaselinemeanof9.0%intheCSIIgroup;
the MDI group experienced a 0.4% reduction from the
same baseline A1C level (52). In contrast to other studies,
this study only enrolled patients with an A1C level be-
tween 8.0 and 10.0% who demonstrated adherence to
monitoring during a 2-month run-in period. Hypoglyce-
mia rates were not different between the two groups.
Based on cost and limited generalizable evidence, CSII
does not represent standard of care for the routine patient
with T2DM who requires insulin therapy. However, this
study indicates that properly chosen patients on advanced
insulin therapy may benefit from CSII. New pharmaco-
logical treatments, such as sodium-glucose cotransporter
2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, can de-
lay the progression to intensive basal-bolus therapy and
further reduce the need for CSII in T2DM (53).
The above statements all pertain to the use of U-100
analog insulin in pumps. Nonrandomized retrospective
studies that moved patients from U-100 insulin MDI to
U-500 insulin by CSII have demonstrated a significant re-
duction in A1C (54–57). However, there have been no
RCTs that have compared CSII with MDI using U-500
regular insulin. The only comparison in the literature is
based on a loosely designed meta-analysis that compared
U-500 by MDI vs CSII between studies, suggesting equal
efficacy but less weight gain and less increase in insulin
dose with CSII (56). Because MDI of U-500 insulin is quite
effective in highly insulin-resistant patients, we will need
to clearly demonstrate that CSII of U-500 insulin is more
effective to justify the added expense (58, 59).
Until we have adequate reliable data supporting the
benefit of CSII vs MDI of U-500 insulin, we suggest lim-
iting this approach to patients whose total daily insulin
dose is greater than 200 U/d despite using all alternative
modalities for treating T2DM. Furthermore, a provider
who is knowledgeable about CSII of U-500 should super-
vise its use.
3. Insulin pump use in the hospital
3.1 We suggest that clinicians continue CSII in patients
admitted to the hospital with either type of diabetes, if the
institution has clear protocols for evaluating patients as
suitable candidates and appropriate monitoring and
safety procedures. (2�QQEE)
Evidence
No RCTs have evaluated the relative benefit of con-
tinuing CSII vs transitioning to iv insulin infusions or MDI
therapy when patients on ambulatory pump therapy are
hospitalizedforacutemedicalillnessorsurgery.However,
studies have reported that hospitals that have well-devel-
oped criteria and processes for diabetes care can deliver
safe and effective in-patient CSII therapy (60–65).
Both the American Diabetes Association and the Amer-
ican Association of Clinical Endocrinologists support
these findings, assuming the patient has the physical and
mental capacity for continued CSII use (15, 66). There are
factors (eg, medical illness, co-medications, the degree of
acute insulin resistance, mental status changes) that could
determine whether CSII therapy is suitable for a hospital-
ized patient; however, no studies have systematically in-
vestigated these factors. Therefore, institutions that are
unable to guarantee appropriate evaluation and support
may decide against CSII use for inpatients (for reasons
such as concerns for medical liability). It is often recom-
mended that this evaluation be completed by an endocri-
nologist experienced in insulin pump therapy. No specific
evidence exists in this regard, and it is likely that any pro-
vider with in-depth pump knowledge and experience
could appropriately guide this process. If CSII is discon-
tinued, appropriate transition to basal-bolus therapy is
imperative.
CSII can generally be continued in patients undergoing
same-dayoroutpatientsurgery,whichmayinvolvefasting
and/or conscious sedation. However, clinicians need to
know that the patient is on an insulin pump and provide
him/her with recommendations on how to prepare for sur-
gery with regard to pump settings. If clinicians are not
comfortable with continuing CSII therapy, they should

 4. Selection of candidates for insulin pump
therapy
4.1 We recommend that before prescribing CSII, clini-
cians perform a structured assessment of a patient’s men-
talandpsychologicalstatus,prioradherencewithdiabetes
self-care measures, willingness and interest in trying the
device, and availability for the required follow-up visits.
(1�QQEE)
Evidence
There are few studies and no RCTs or systematic re-
views that have specifically examined or identified which
factorspredictsuccessfulCSIIuse(15,19–22,29,67),and
some patients do well with CSII who don’t exhibit char-
acteristicsthatareconsiderfavorableforsuccess.Evenless
evidence is available to determine what knowledge, ex-
pertise, and resources clinicians need to teach and support
CSII use. Of the studies that did examine factors for suc-
cessful CSII use, there is relatively consistent evidence that
higher A1C levels at baseline are associated with greater
A1C reduction on CSII (28, 29, 68–70). However, Orr et
al (28) reported that an A1C level over 10% was associ-
ated with poor outcomes with CSII. Interestingly, Nixon
et al (71) recently reported that among those placed on
CSII for elevated A1C, about 12% show no benefit at any
time after transitioning from MDI, and 57% showed early
A1Creductionwithlaterdeterioration.Inregardstoother
factors,thestudybyOrretal(28)foundthatmentalillness
andahistoryofmissedappointmentspredictedworseout-
comes with CSII. Likewise, Grant et al (72) reported that
significant anxiety or depression was associated with
poorer outcomes with CSII. Data are lacking on the rela-
tionship between the frequency of SMBG and success with
CSII. However, one study that evaluated clinic experience
did report an association between the frequency of SMBG
and success with CSII (73). Among adults, age does not
appear to be a major determinant (74).
In summary, there is modest evidence that certain cri-
teria are relevant in choosing patients for CSII therapy.
Clinical experience suggests that adult CSII candidates
should receive a thorough evaluation before initiating
therapy to assess a wide range of diabetes self-care behav-
iors. Factors to consider are: baseline A1C, patient history
of adherence to follow-up appointments and provider-
recommended glucose monitoring, a realistic recognition
by the patient of the limitations of CSII, evidence of a
significant psychological disease that is likely to impact
adherence, and confirmed availability for follow-up in the
immediate post-pump initiation period. It is also recom-
mended that before initiating CSII, clinicians assess and
address general gaps in patient diabetes knowledge or self-
care behaviors, including carbohydrate counting and sick-
day rules.
5. Use of bolus calculators in insulin pump therapy
5.1 We suggest encouraging patients to use appropri-
ately adjusted embedded bolus calculators in CSII and to
have appropriate education regarding their use and limi-
tations. (2�QQEE)
Evidence
Many intensively managed individuals rely on estima-
tions to calculate prandial and correction insulin (75). As
time passes, there may be a tendency to approximate the
prandial bolus based on the “usual” or “typical” carbo-
hydrate content of the meals with variable success (76). In
2002,theDeltecCozmopumpfirstintroducedtechnology
thathelpspatientscalculatebolusinsulin(carbohydrateto
insulin ratios as well as correction ratios in the event of
hyperglycemia) as part of CSII therapy. Other companies
soon introduced their own calculators for this purpose,
hoping to reduce variability and patient errors (77). Stud-
ies evaluating the effect of a dose calculator have found
some beneficial outcomes, such as reduced mean glucose,
reduced need for glucose treatment of hypoglycemia, de-
creased frequency of correction boluses (reduced stack-
ing), and decreased postprandial glucose levels (78–80).
However, findings have not been consistent, and no large
RCTs have specifically demonstrated the benefit of bolus
calculators.
The calculator feature was unique to CSII, but this ca-
pability is now available for those on MDI, where it has
reduced A1C by at least 0.5% and improved patient sat-
isfaction but not hypoglycemia (81–83). To facilitate the
transition from one therapeutic approach to another and
to help achieve glycemic targets, we suggest that before
initiating CSII therapy, clinicians should determine indi-
vidualized prandial and correction insulin dosing algo-
rithms (insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio and insulin sensitiv-
ity factors), blood glucose targets, and active insulin time
(84). We do not recommend the general use of insulin
calculators unrelated to CSII, such as smart phone apps
that are not FDA approved. The FDA has only approved
the meter bolus calculator mentioned above (69).
The current approach to prandial insulin dose calcula-
tion (based on carbohydrate-to-insulin ratios) assumes
that carbohydrates are the only macronutrient that im-
pacts postprandial glucose control in T1DM. However, as
summarized in a recent systematic review of the literature
(85),high-fat/proteinmealsrequiremoreinsulinthanlow-
er-fat/protein meals with identical carbohydrate content
to optimize postprandial glucose control (86, 87). How-
ever, Bell et al (85) reported that available studies have

 significant methodological differences (88–90), and reli-
able definitive data are lacking on the optimum split and
duration of advanced pump boluses needed to adjust glu-
cose levels associated with high fat and protein content
meals.
6. Real-time continuous glucose monitors in adult
outpatients
6.1 We recommend RT-CGM devices for adult patients
with T1DM who have A1C levels above target and who
are willing and able to use these devices on a nearly daily
basis. (1�QQQQ)
Evidence
The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF)
study (91), the Guard Control Study (92), and O’Connell
et al (93) demonstrated that adults with A1C levels �
7.0% had a greater reduction in A1C using RT-CGM than
with intermittent SMBG (0.5, 0.6, and 0.43%, respec-
tively). Furthermore, unlike findings with SMBG, the im-
provement in A1C with CGM is not accompanied by an
increase in biochemical hypoglycemia (92, 94). The im-
provement in A1C in the CGM subjects in the 6-month
JDRF trial was sustained during the 6-month observa-
tional period that followed completion of the trial (95).
This ongoing benefit occurred despite a reduction in of-
fice-visitfrequencyduringthisobservationalperiodtolev-
els similar to routine care (2.7 � 1.2 visits over 6 months).
Furthermore, the incidence rate of severe hypoglycemia
declined from 20.5 events per 100 patient-years during the
initial 6-month RCT to 12.1 events per 100 patient-years
during the 6-month observational follow-up period.
To date, CGM trials have enrolled patients using con-
tinuous CSII pumps and MDI, and no studies have eval-
uated the added benefit of starting CGM in adult patients
using MDI therapy. In the JDRF trial (91), the patients
using CSII and MDI had a similar reduction in A1C; how-
ever, because MDI users comprised only 20% of the total
study population, the improvement in this subgroup did
not reach statistical significance. The ongoing Multiple
Daily Injections and Continuous Glucose Monitoring in
Diabetes study (96) examining RT-CGM in T1DM and
T2DM adults using MDI should provide conclusive data
regarding
the
benefit
of
this
technology
in
these
individuals.
6.2 We recommend RT-CGM devices for adult patients
with well-controlled T1DM who are willing and able to
use these devices on a nearly daily basis. (1�QQQQ)
Evidence
The JDRF study demonstrated that when compared
with standard blood glucose monitoring, T1DM patients
with A1C levels � 7.0% that use RT-CGM can reduce the
frequency of biochemical hypoglycemia (which they de-
fined as a blood glucose level below 70 mg/dL) and main-
tain A1C levels � 7.0% over a 6-month study period. Of
the 129 enrolled subjects, 62 (48%) were younger than 25
years of age, and 67 (52%) were older than 25 years. The
median time per day with a glucose level of � 70 mg/dL
was less in the RT-CGM group than in the control group;
however, the difference was not statistically significant. In
this study, almost all the other analyses (including the time
per day � 60 mg/dL, time per day between 71 and 180
mg/dL, and combined outcomes involving A1C coupled
with hypoglycemia) statistically favored the RT-CGM
groupcomparedwiththecontrolgroup.Treatmenteffects
were generally similar across age groups (95). For RT-
CGM users who were 25 years and older, the incidence
rate of severe hypoglycemia was 21.8 events per 100 per-
son-years during the 6-month RCT and 7.1 events per 100
person-years during the 6 months of CGM use after the
trial. For those in this group whose A1C levels were below
7.0%, the incidence rate of severe hypoglycemia was 23.6
events per 100 person-years during the 6-month RCT and
0 per 100 patient-years during the 6 months of CGM use
after the trial (97). This evidence of improvements in gly-
cemic control over the long-term points to the role of the
user’s skills and knowledge of new CGM technology, and
this may partly account for the failure of other RCTs (that
enrolledindividualswithpoorerglycemiccontrol)todem-
onstrate a reduction in severe hypoglycemia (98, 99). In a
multicenter European/Israeli RCT that included adults
with T1DM whose A1C levels were � 7.5%, a post hoc
per protocol analysis demonstrated that time spent in hy-
poglycemia below 63 mg/dL was reduced by 50% (P �
.02) in the adults (100).
Use of CGM in adults with T2DM
6.3 We suggest short-term, intermittent RT-CGM use
inadultpatientswithT2DM(notonprandialinsulin)who
have A1C levels � 7% and are willing and able to use the
device. (2�QQEE)
Evidence
This recommendation is based on data from one well-
performed large-scale RCT performed by Vigersky and
colleagues (101, 102) and one other smaller study (103)
showing similar outcomes. The Vigersky trial involved
100 adults with T2DM on therapies including diet and
exercise alone and various combinations of other antihy-
perglycemic medications, including basal but not prandial
insulin.ResultsshowedthatintermittentRT-CGMusefor
12 weeks (four cycles of 2 weeks use/1 week off) resulted

 40-week follow-up period (the changes in A1C [mean �
SEM] at 12 and 52 weeks were 1.0 � 1.1% and
0.8 � 1.5% in the RT-CGM group vs 0.5 � 0.8% and
0.2 � 1.3% in the SBGM control group; P � .04 for
control vs RT-CGM group). This improvement in the RT-
CGM group occurred without a greater intensification of
medication, as compared to the control group, indicating
that it probably reflected changes in self-care prompted by
CGM use. Yoo et al (103) randomized patients (with
T2DMandA1Clevelsof8–10%onoralagentsorinsulin)
to RT-CGM use for 3 days per month for 12 weeks vs
SBGM six times per week for 12 weeks in the control
group. Both the RT-CGM and SBGM control groups had
significant reductions in A1C at the 12-week follow-up
(RT-CGM, 9.1 � 1.0% to 8.0 � 1.2%, P � .001; SBGM,
8.7 � 0.7% to 8.3 � 1.1%, P � .01) with a significant
difference in the improvement between the two groups
(P � .004). The relative difference in improvements in
A1C between the RT-CGM and control groups may have
been exaggerated by the fact that the control group only
performed SBGM 6.1 times per week in the trial, and this
may limit the relevance of the trial findings, especially to
patients who perform SBGM multiple times per day.
We need consistent data from additional well-per-
formed RCTs in patients with different health literacy and
sociodemographic characteristics (compared to patients
enrolled in the above two trials) to confirm that these find-
ings are generalizable to the broader T2DM population.
At present, no data exist for RT-CGM use in patients with
T2DM on prandial insulin. The ongoing Daily Injections
and Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Diabetes study
(96) should provide conclusive data regarding the poten-
tial benefits of this technology in this T2DM population.
We excluded several studies on CGM in T2DM that
were incorporated in a previous meta-analysis (104) be-
cause they employed older technology (105) and involved
blinded (instead of real-time) CGM use (106). Retrospec-
tive data analysis from blinded CGM devices has a role in
the care of patients with both T1DM and T2DM, espe-
cially the elderly population who, because of restrictions
on Medicare coverage, do not have access to RT-CGM.
This older population has a relatively high incidence of
hypoglycemia. Munshi et al (107) demonstrated that
blinded CGM is helpful in therapeutic decision-making in
this vulnerable age group, and it also helps detect hypo-
glycemia that is otherwise unrecognized with intermittent
capillary blood glucose monitoring.
Education and training on the use of CSII and CGM
6.4 We suggest that adults with T1DM and T2DM who
use CSII and CGM receive education, training, and on-
going support to help achieve and maintain individualized
glycemic goals. (Ungraded Good Practice Statement)
Evidence
There are few high-quality comparative studies regard-
ing the effectiveness of educational components and strat-
egies for CSII use. As a result, there are limited data about
how best to train individuals on using CSII to optimize
glycemic control. It should also be noted that primary care
providers manage a good number of patients using CSII,
and in this setting, insulin pump company employees or
contracted consultants provide initial training. We found
no studies that compared this form of education and train-
ing to that delivered in an endocrinology practice by dia-
betes educators using a formal CSII education curriculum.
No RCTs have evaluated the effectiveness of educational
strategies and protocols for transitioning patients from
MDI to CSII with stand-alone RT-CGM or sensor-inte-
grated pump (SIP) therapy (where the CGM is integrated
with the insulin pump but does not necessarily control
insulin delivery, as occurs with sensor-augmented pump
[SAP] therapy). It is important to be aware of insurance
plan requirements with regard to participation in a com-
prehensive diabetes program. Some require participation
in these programs within 6 months before either a new
pump application or CGM application; this is also true for
patients seeking an upgraded device.
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion
A 2011 systematic review that included five descriptive
studies of individuals with T1DM over the age of 16 years
recommended that adults with T1DM starting CSII or
already utilizing CSII receive comprehensive advice, edu-
cation, and training (84). The authors concluded, how-
ever, that it was difficult to draw strong conclusions about
the effectiveness of educational components and strategies
due to the lack of high-quality comparative studies. They
concluded that no educational method was significantly
more effective than any other method. One descriptive
study of 250 participants with T1DM found a highly sig-
nificant impact on A1C levels (P � .0001) and a reduction
in hypoglycemia (P � .001) over a 12-month period after
a 7-day teaching and training program that included in-
structions regarding managing daily living, using CSII, ad-
justing insulin doses, preventing and managing hypogly-
cemia and diabetic ketoacidosis, and understanding the
role of SMBG (108). Consensus statements and guidelines
from the American Association of Clinical Endocrinolo-
gists and the American Association of Diabetes Educators
also recommend education and training on technical as-
pects of pump operation, day-to-day self-care manage-
ment, and how to handle emergency situations (15, 67). A

ducted on CSII education and training for individuals with
T2DM(49,50,111).Table1outlineseducationandtrain-
ing for CSII therapy.
SIP therapy or CSII with stand-alone CGM
To be successful with SIP or CSII, stand-alone CGM
patients need to understand how to use this technology as
part of their daily diabetes self-management. Providing
information about how these devices work before initia-
tion, as well as supporting patients thorough education
and training is key to safe and effective use of this tech-
nology. Unfortunately, research is lacking in this area as
well. Although not designed to study the effectiveness of
educational components associated with CGM use, two
multicenter RCTs did provide detailed information on the
education and training interventions provided in the treat-
ment arms (91, 112). The JDRF CGM Study Group trial
provided both the investigational and control groups with
one-on-one training on RT-CGM or a glucose meter, as
well as written instructions on how to make real-time ad-
justmentsofinsulindosesandusecomputersoftware(91).
Participants with SIP or CSII plus RT-CGM received ad-
ditional instructions on modifying insulin doses by using
treatment algorithms based on glucose trends. Another
trial randomized participants with T1DM (who were na-
ive to both CSII and RT-CGM) to either continue MDI or
transition to SIP and provided a stepwise education pro-
tocol for introducing these different devices (112). The
subjects in the SIP arm were introduced to CSII first and
RT-CGM approximately 2 weeks later. The SIP arm also
received technology-specific training over an additional
3-week period. The study used the patients’ own data as a
teaching tool to enhance experience-based training. In all
subjects using SIP, A1C levels fell rapidly from baseline to
3 months (8.3 � 0.5% to 7.5% [absolute reduction of
0.8 � 0.8%; P � .001]) and remained significantly lower
throughout the study compared to those using MDI ther-
apy (8.3 � 0.5% to 8.1% [absolute reduction of 0.2 �
0.9%; P � .001]). In the absence of evidence from RCTs
on training methods, clinical experience guides practice.

Table 3 lists clinical and administrative resources that

The evolution of CSII and CGM toward the bionic
pancreas
Although SIP therapy is not new, there are no large
RCTs comparing it directly to basal-bolus insulin injec-
tions using similar blood glucose monitoring strategies.
However, there is an RCT involving 329 adult patients
with T1DM that showed that SIP resulted in a 0.6%
greater A1C reduction vs MDIs of analog insulin (112).
The study did not include an arm with CSII alone or MDI
with RT-CGM.
A new product, SAP, has advanced SIP technology by
adding a “low glucose suspend” function. A sensor reads
glucose levels and adjusts the insulin pump accordingly,
discontinuing insulin delivery when glucose reaches a pro-
grammed level. One study in adults with documented noc-
turnal hypoglycemia randomly assigned 247 patients to
an SIP or an SAP that could stop insulin delivery for up to
2 hours (116). Overall nocturnal hypoglycemia (defined
as 65 mg/dL or less for at least 20 minutes between 10 PM
and 8 AM) was reduced by 31.8% without rebound hy-
perglycemia (1.5 � 1.0 vs 2.2 � 1.3 per patient week; P �
.001); there were four episodes of severe hypoglycemia
(defined as hypoglycemia resulting in coma or seizures or
requiring medical assistance), all in the SIP-alone group.
This RCT indicates that SAP can reduce nocturnal hypo-
glycemia in populations at high risk for hypoglycemia.
Current technologies, combined with faster insulin,
better sensor accuracy, and improved pumps that can ad-
just or discontinue insulin delivery to prevent hypoglyce-
mia and excessive hyperglycemic exposure, make the
promise of a “closed loop” seem reasonable. It is unclear
at this time whether a dual hormone system would be
superior (117, 118). It is premature to grade the early data
from studies on these new technologies, but the future for
a commercial version of one or more of these devices is
promising. To realize large-scale and long-term use of
these devices, we need a better understanding of the cath-
eter and site problems common with CSII and RT-CGM
and appropriate cost-benefit analysis when compared to
currenttherapies.AEuropeanAssociationfortheStudyof
Diabetes and American Diabetes Association Diabetes
Technology Working Group statement discusses sugges-
tions for future research on the efficacy and safety of CSII
(119). Finally, prior to the arrival of these new technolo-
gies, efforts have been ongoing to standardize the report-
ing of data from various devices so this information can be
more easily interpreted and incorporated into electronic
medical records (112). It is imperative that as devices pro-
liferate, we consider the human factor, both in terms of
howeasily,safely,andeffectivelypeoplewithdiabetesand
their caregivers can use these devices and how easily and

age-related changes; changes in insurance coverage; or changes in healthcare provider managing CSII use.
Time periods to assess patient self-care behaviors and knowledge
Before initiating RT-CGM, assess:
Patient understanding that CGM does not replace SMBG.
Factors and self-care behaviors that may influence success with CGM.
When initiating RT-CGM, assess:
Knowledge of CGM system components---receiver, sensor, and transmitter.
Understanding of how CGM data differ from SMBG data.
Use of trend information based on changing glucose levels to adjust insulin doses.
Use of SMBG to calibrate CGM system.
Site selection and care.
Alarms (Check that alarms are set in a fashion to optimize patient benefit and minimize alarm fatigue. The initial focus is
often on low alerts and falling blood glucose alarms. High alerts can be turned off or set well above target at first if patient is
consistently high and doesn’t benefit from high alerts.)
Annually and/or when upgrading technology (for ongoing RT-CGM use), re-assess:
Ability to make insulin adjustment based on trend information.
Use of SMBG to calibrate.

Suggested Health Care Provider Resources to Support the Safe and Effective Use of CSII and RT-CGM
Clinicians should implement a formalized educational plan for the initiation and long-term support of CSII and RT-CGM
that is established by the practice setting. Clinicians should communicate education plans to potential candidates and
individuals new to the practice setting.
Clinics should have a designated multidisciplinary diabetes team to evaluate potential candidates, initiate therapy and
education, and to support long-term CSII and RT-CGM use that is part of the practice setting. Alternatively, a sole
practitioner may also provide medical care and CSII education supported by other healthcare professionals or industry
consultants as indicated. CSII and RT-CGM diabetes care team members could include the following health care
providers: endocrinologist, advanced practice registered nurse, physician’s assistant, primary care provider, certified
diabetes educator, registered dietitian with expertise in diabetes medical nutrition therapy, and mental health/behavioral
therapists.
The clinical support staff or patient should know how to download data from glucose meters, insulin pumps, and RT-
CGMs, and they should download data before an appointment in order to review data via print format, online secure
patient pump portal, or the patient’s electronic health record.
Designated staff members (diabetes educators, medical assistants, or patient service representatives) should be available to
help clinics obtain prior authorizations, schedule peer-to-peer reviews, submit supporting documents for determining
coverage, answer insurance and distributor/third party vendor queries for additional documentation, and issue letters of
support and/or appeal if therapy is declined.
