Abstract
Despite substantial recent progress, our understanding of the principles and mechanisms 
underlying complex brain function and cognition remains incomplete. Network neuroscience 
proposes to tackle these enduring challenges. Approaching brain structure and function from an 
explicitly integrative perspective, network neuroscience pursues new ways to map, record, analyze 
and model the elements and interactions of neurobiological systems. Two parallel trends drive the 
approach: the availability of new empirical tools to create comprehensive maps and record 
dynamic patterns among molecules, neurons, brain areas and social systems; and the theoretical 
framework and computational tools of modern network science. The convergence of empirical and 
computational advances opens new frontiers of scientific inquiry, including network dynamics, 
manipulation and control of brain networks, and integration of network processes across 
spatiotemporal domains. We review emerging trends in network neuroscience and attempt to chart 
a path toward a better understanding of the brain as a multiscale networked system.
Neuroscience is entering a period marked by a rapid expansion in the size, scope and 
complexity of neural data acquired from large portions of nervous systems and spanning 
multiple levels of organization1,2. Much of these ‘big data’ represent networks comprising 
the relations or interconnections that link the many elements of large-scale neurobiological 
systems3–6. Examples include protein interaction and genetic regulatory networks, synaptic 
connections and anatomical projections among brain areas, dynamic patterns of neural 
signaling and communication associated with spontaneous and task-evoked brain activity, 
and interactions among brain systems and the environment in the course of behavior. 
Notably, these data often cross multiple levels of organization (neurons, circuits, systems, 
whole brain) or involve different domains of biology and data types (for example, 
anatomical and functional connectivity, genetic patterns and disease states, activity in 
distributed brain regions in relation to behavioral phenotypes). The size and complexity of

 these data require sophisticated strategies for statistical inference and dimensionality 
reduction7 and present important challenges for scalable computing8, data sharing, and 
reproducibility9.
These recent developments not only pose challenges, but they also provide unique 
opportunities, as sophisticated empirical methods for mapping and recording 
neurobiological data intersect with theoretical and computational advances in data analysis 
and modeling of brain networks. We propose to call the research agenda emerging at this 
intersection ‘network neuroscience’. In this review, we outline the fundamentals of network 
neuroscience and highlight a selection of current and future topics. Our emphasis is less on 
past achievements and more on identifying emerging trends that will shape the field going 
forward. We survey new empirical and computational tools and discuss how these tools can 
become useful for attacking long-standing complex problems and research frontiers. An 
important focus is on how such tools may help to uncover network structures and processes 
that support integrative brain function and span multiple spatial and temporal scales (Fig. 1). 
We argue that network neuroscience theories and tools will bring substantial changes to the 
types of questions that we can ask and the hypotheses that we can test, ushering in a new era 
of network-based inquiry into brain structure and function.
Network mapping and observation
One of the major developments supporting the growth of network neuroscience involves the 
creation of powerful methodologies that enable the comprehensive recording of connections 
and interactions in neurobiological systems. What these methodologies have in common is 
that they capture large numbers of elements and then record all of their interactions in 
parallel, resulting in data sets that take the mathematical form of graphs or networks (Fig. 2). 
Major advances have occurred in the measurements of molecular interactions, the mapping 
of structural connections among neurons and brain areas (connectomics), the physiological 
recordings of activity in ensembles of neurons or across the whole brain, the automated 
classification of behaviors, and the tracking of social dynamics.
Building on the as yet unparalleled achievement of mapping the neuronal wiring of the 
nematode C. elegans10, the reconstruction of synaptic connectivity among neurons at the 
ultrastructural level has evolved rapidly, as has measurement of extra-synaptic 
connectivity11. Among recent studies in C. elegans12, as well as in the Drosophila visual 
system13, are refined mappings of connections among sensory and effector neurons, whose 
network patterns have offered important insights into the specific behavioral contributions of 
network elements. However, the enterprise of ultrastructural connectomics has been 
challenged by the sheer size and volume of vertebrate brains14. One of the largest efforts 
thus far has resulted in a connection map of a portion of the mouse retina involving the 
tracing of the neurites of 950 distinct neurons15. Although such ‘dense reconstructions’ 
capture cellular architecture in fine detail, they remain vulnerable to reconstruction errors 
and require expert curation for reliable detection of synaptic couplings. Alternative 
approaches use RNA barcoding to label projections of individual neurons, which may allow 
for high-volume tracing of neuronal circuits at single-cell resolution16.

 Complementary mesoscale efforts to map more extended portions of the nervous systems of 
several model organisms have employed large-scale optical imaging as well as quantitative 
histological tract tracing. High-throughput tracing and imaging approaches (which require 
careful monitoring of sensitivity and specificity) have resulted in network data sets recording 
the connections among ‘local processing units’ in Drosophila17 as well as interregional 
projections in the mouse18. A different approach builds on expertly curated neuroinformatics 
databases of anatomical observations to construct aggregated data sets of network 
connectivity, such as in rat19 and macaque monkey20. Quantitative assessment of tract 
tracing experiments reveals relatively dense networks that include projections ranging in 
strength over six orders of magnitude21. Finally, there is continuous improvement of 
methodology in diffusion imaging and tractography, which allows the inference of the 
trajectory and strength of white matter projections in the human brain22. Although subject to 
many experimental and statistical limitations23 and interpretational pitfalls24, comparative 
studies have suggested that representations of long-distance connectivity derived from 
invasive histological methods and noninvasive imaging of neuroanatomical structure are 
significantly related25.
Advances in optical cellular imaging have enabled recordings of neuronal activity in 
extended functional circuits26, in some cases spanning the whole organism27. Imaging of 
Ca2+ dynamics, as well as genetically encoded fluorescent reporters of membrane voltages, 
generates dynamic functional data from hundreds to thousands of neurons. Following 
processing steps such as image registration and cell sorting, the data can be represented as 
time traces that can be subjected to statistical time series analyses. Parallel recordings from 
hundreds of neurons enable computational strategies that identify and characterize functional 
interactions and statistical dependencies between neurons. The resulting functional networks 
can be examined for modular organization, as well as for evidence of coherent network 
states and patterned temporal dynamics. Functional network analysis has progressed most 
strongly in applications to noninvasive electromagnetic or functional magnetic resonance 
imaging recordings from the human brain. Major themes include the definition of coherent 
subnetworks spanning the whole brain28 that exhibit changing topology in conditions of rest 
(spontaneous activity) and task demand29, or in relation to visual input30. Methodological 
advances involve improved sensitivity in measures of statistical dependence, inference of 
causal links, and greater temporal resolution. An important frontier is the analysis of 
sequences of functional networks that change across time.
Linking elements and interactions in the brain to different domains of behavior has advanced 
from classic univariate (one region, one behavior) to bivariate (connectivity, behavior) and 
finally to multivariate frameworks31. Large-scale studies of brain-behavior relations and 
behavior-behavior dependencies, although still in their infancy, promise to provide a rich 
database for mapping the relations among brain processes and their contributions to 
perception, action and cognition. In one such study carried out in Drosophila, the roles of 
neurons in triggering a diverse set of behaviors was systematically investigated by 
optogenetically stimulating individual neuronal cell lines and recording the associated 
behavioral responses32. Machine-learning techniques were then applied to extract 
statistically robust relations between neuron lines and behavioral phenotypes, resulting in a 
neuron-behavior atlas. This work illustrates the utility of using relational data to establish

 mappings from clusters of neural elements to clusters of behavioral phenotypes. On a very 
different organizational scale, brain-behavior relations have been approached through meta-
analyses of large repositories of human neuroimaging experiments reporting patterns of 
brain activation in relation to different domains of behavior and cognition. Aggregating brain 
imaging data from thousands of such studies allowed the construction of ‘co-activation 
networks’, whose major components and overall network topology strongly resembled 
functional networks derived from resting-state (task-free) recordings33. Finally, as 
demonstrated in a study of chemotaxis in C. elegans34, our understanding of the 
relationships between neural dynamics and observable behaviors can benefit from 
integrating data capturing the topology of anatomical networks with behavioral data 
acquired as the organism is interacting with its environment.
Brain networks may be viewed as ‘intermediate phenotypes’35 that are situated between the 
domains of genetics and molecular systems, and the expression of individual and collective 
behavior in the environment. As such, brain networks mediate the causal effect of genetics 
on behavior and vice versa. For example, genetic mutations may cause changes in network 
topology that in turn drive alterations in behavior. Indeed, network science has made 
substantial advances into characterizing both molecular and social systems, and the effect of 
these advances are beginning to be felt at the intermediate scales of mesoscale neural circuits 
and large-scale brain systems.
At molecular scales, the arrival of comprehensive molecular and genomic data for many 
organisms, including humans, has ushered in the new discipline of systems biology36, which 
combines high-throughput measurements of molecular data with modeling and 
computational analysis. Systems biology recognizes that most biological functions and 
phenotypes cannot be reduced to the action of individual proteins or biomolecules, but rather 
emerge from their interactions in molecular complexes and in cells, giving rise to 
spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression, tissue growth and differentiation, and other 
integrative biological processes. In systems biology, networks are core ingredients for 
analysis and modeling37, for example, in proteomics38, mapping of gene-disorder 
relationships39 and genetics-based comorbidity studies40. The architecture of these networks 
at the molecular scale affects higher order functions measured at the larger scale of 
functional brain areas. Here, network interactions offer important insights into the biological 
mechanisms associated with several common brain disorders, including schizophrenia41 and 
autism42. Convergent evidence suggests that the biological bases of psychiatric illness 
cannot be fully accounted for by small numbers of mutations or risk factors. Instead, these 
disorders involve disturbances in biological networks on multiple spatial scales.
Social data, aggregated into networks, capture important aspects of individual and collective 
behavior. The ubiquity of digital traces of human behavior has led to a rapid expansion of 
computational social science43, a new discipline that leverages methods and tools from 
statistical physics and computer science to observe and predict the collective behavior of 
organizations and societies. Going beyond small-scale analyses of data laboriously gathered 
from individuals in laboratory settings, computational social science relies on the parallel 
and pervasive collection of rich spatiotemporal data capturing the organization and dynamics 
of large-scale social systems. The approach has promise in providing new means to monitor

 and enhance behavioral and mental health, such as in individuals with major depressive 
disorder44.
Network analysis and modeling
Networks are phenomena of the natural, social and technological world that are studied 
across many disciplines with a common toolset provided by network science45. Perhaps 
most foundational is graph theory, a branch of mathematics that examines the properties of 
graphs or networks, defined as sets of nodes and edges that represent system elements and 
their interrelations46. In neuroscience, descriptive measures that report on local and global 
features of network topology have been widely applied across structural and functional data 
sets from multiple species. These analyses have consistently revealed nonrandom 
topological attributes, such as high clustering and short path length3,47, and network 
communities (modules) linked by highly connected hub nodes48 that are in turn densely 
linked, forming an integrative core49 or rich club50. Recent investigations have examined 
more complex organizational features such as hierarchical organization51,52, the role of 
geometry and spatial embedding in large-scale anatomical connectivity53, and the 
importance of considering relationships among multiple structural constraints when 
accounting for the emergence of significant network attributes54. Indeed, the brain is 
inherently a spatially embedded network, and physical constraints resulting from that 
embedding underlie functionally important network characteristics, such as efficient network 
communication and information processing. The application of graph measures has also 
been critically examined with respect to sensitivity to node/edge definition, spatial and 
temporal resolution, and reliability and reproducibility across observations55. Important 
issues currently under development involve improved and domain-appropriate approaches 
for module (community) detection56, model-based inference of networks from observational 
data57, and statistically principled methods for network comparison across different 
individuals and in different conditions58.
More recently, methods from network science are expanding in new directions, going 
beyond descriptive accounts of network topology and toward addressing network dynamics, 
generative principles and higher order dependencies among nodes. One prominent example 
is the development of methods for assessing multi-scale organization in networks. This 
includes characterizing fluctuations in community structure of networks across time59, and 
implementing dynamic processes on networks as a diagnostic tool for explicitly linking 
micro-scale features of network organization to macro-scale characteristics of 
neurophysiological dynamics60. Yet another approach uses network science to ask questions 
about the processes that can potentially generate the topology of an empirical network. Such 
generative models can clarify the contributions of spatial embedding and other (non-spatial) 
wiring rules in shaping the network topology of the connectome61, and can also reveal 
potential factors driving the selection of functionally important network attributes62. Finally, 
the application of concepts from algebraic topology (Fig. 3) attempts to discern non-random 
structure in networks by going beyond dyadic relations (two nodes linked by an edge) and 
considering non-dyadic, higher order relations among network nodes63–65, a goal that is 
complementary to that motivating the use of graphs in which edges can link any number of 
nodes, or so-called hypergraphs66. This approach can identify non-random structure in

 structural connectivity of cortical microcircuits67, such as unexpectedly high numbers of 
directed ‘all-to-all’ connected cliques of neurons, or cavities in which edges are 
conspicuously absent68.
Time series analysis is a common basis for constructing edges in functional networks. 
Generally, different methods aim to extract covariance or correlation (hence delivering non-
causal similarity-based metrics of statistical dependence) and to estimate the direction and 
strength of causal influence. Although correlation-based metrics are generally simple to 
compute, the propensity of correlations to ‘fill in’ links among indirectly coupled nodes 
(transitive closure)69 tends to result in networks that are overly dense, clustered and 
modular, containing many dependencies that arise from indirect interactions in the 
underlying anatomy. Although computing partial correlations can address this issue and 
yield sparser networks, the resulting topologies are difficult to interpret, may regress away 
true interactions, and require many samples to achieve stability. Measures of directed 
influence based on temporal precedence cues such as Granger causality and transfer entropy 
result in directed edges that provide information about the extent to which the past of one 
time series can predict the future of another. In this narrow sense, these networks portray 
potential causal relations among network nodes, and they have been shown to have some 
utility in systems of spiking neurons70 and electrophysiological recordings. In contrast with 
time series analysis tools for functional networks, effective onnectivity offers a model-based 
account of directed causal links among network elements that is derived by rigorous model 
selection criteria. Model-based effective connectivity is central to the framework of dynamic 
causal modeling71, which allows the estimation of dynamic couplings among brain nodes 
and their modulation by time, task or sensory input.
As is the case in systems biology, there is a growing role for numerical simulations and 
computational models of brain circuits and systems in explaining and predicting empirical 
functional network data. These approaches can provide effective generative models of brain 
responses that simulate the activity of neural elements and their interactions. Simulation 
environments, such as The Virtual Brain at the level of whole-brain models72, Neuron at the 
level of neuronal circuits73, and OpenWorm specifically for the organism C. elegans74, 
generate neuronal time series resulting from the biophysical properties of neuronal elements 
that are linked by a network of structural (synaptic) couplings. Such forward modeling can 
be combined with model inversion that, constrained by model selection, allows inferences on 
model parameters associated with candidate neurobiological mechanisms75. Similar 
modeling and simulation approaches are applied to protein interaction and genetic regulatory 
networks76, can capture the translation of genotype to phenotype in whole cells77, and have 
become important tools in studies of social dynamics and collective behavior78. The ever 
accelerating power and decreasing cost of computing has brought network-based simulations 
and mathematical models of neurobiological systems at all scales within the reach of most 
investigators.

 Current frontiers
Network dynamics
One of the emerging frontiers of network neuroscience is the investigation of network 
dynamics (Fig. 4). The broad question of how networks change encompasses at least two 
important and distinct dimensions79: how activity patterns can change on top of a fixed 
structural network (referred to as dynamics on networks) and how network edges themselves 
can reconfigure (referred to as dynamics of networks). Although most current investigations 
are focusing on one or the other of these two dimensions, future work will undoubtedly 
expand to develop methods and insights that straddle both domains.
The concept of dynamics on networks builds on the notion that the complex physiological 
activity of neural systems is fundamentally constrained by the patterns of connections 
between their elements. These processes include neuronal activation, the release of 
neurotransmitters, the editing of genetic expression, the utilization of energy in terms of 
cellular metabolism and the assembly of information. How these processes depend on 
underlying connections between neurons, areas or genes is the perennial question of how 
form constrains function. The first forays into this question have emerged at the level of 
large-scale neuroimaging in humans, where activation patterns at rest can be partially 
predicted by the underlying network of white-matter tracts80,81. Modeling the evolution of 
these patterns can be tackled using first-order difference equations, oscillators, neural mass 
models and other approaches82. Perhaps equally intriguingly, one can also exercise 
phenomenological models to gain an intuition regarding processes whose physiology is less 
well understood, such as the trans-synaptic spread of prions thought to cause dementia83 or 
the propagation of information packets along parallel structural routes84.
Notably, changes in function can elicit changes in structure, leading to dynamics of 
networks. The first conception of dynamics of networks grew from the recognition that 
many physical and biological systems display patterns of connections that change over time, 
in different contexts or in response to varying external demands. Indeed, this recognition 
now pervades many areas of neuroscientific investigation, from the changing patterns of 
functional connectivity85 to the patterns of genome folding over developmental timescales86 
or genetic coexpression over evolutionary timescales87. Quantitatively characterizing and 
mathematically modeling these evolving patterns of connectivity was largely intractable 
before recent advances in the field of applied mathematics. So-called multilayer networks88 
offer mathematically principled models of evolving networks as well as a battery of 
statistical variables to characterize their evolution. Initial applications of these tools to 
neuroimaging data have addressed questions of how connectivity between brain regions 
changes over the lifespan89, during behavioral adaptation or learning90, and across 
frequency domains91. However, these applications have only begun to scratch the surface of 
empirical avenues of inquiry in which patterns of connections between neurophysiological 
elements evolve or change in a manner that is critical for system function. A current 
fundamental challenge lies in constructing appropriate generative models that can be used to 
infer the dynamic mechanisms potentially driving these network reconfigurations and how 
they might be altered in disease states92.

 Although dynamics on networks and dynamics of networks are both important areas of 
research, emerging tools from machine learning are beginning to bring the two areas 
together to better understand the time-varying expression of sets of networks, where all 
networks in the set exist at every time point, but each network is expressed to differing 
amounts93. In addition, developing methods for understanding the dynamics of networks-of-
networks that are interconnected with one another across contexts and scales remains 
challenging94. Could changes in functional connectivity driven by task performance be 
predicted by an individual’s place in their social network95? Could changes in the 
interactions among individuals lead to changes in the inter-subject correlation in brain 
activity96? What are the meaningful (and tractable) classes of networks-of-networks that we 
can begin to understand? These and related questions will likely compose an increasing 
focus of network neuroscience in the immediate future.
Prediction
As it is still a relatively young field, network neuroscience has focused on describing 
neuroscientific data in the language of graph theory and network science, and it has begun to 
recast avenues of inquiry in terms of explicitly network-based hypotheses. However, this 
general paradigm shift underscores the necessity of complementing simple descriptions with 
mechanistic predictions97. Indeed, although network models are traditionally viewed as tools 
to quantify structure, they have a complementary role as tools to predict system function. 
Moreover, this predictive power can be used broadly across genetics, systems biology, 
neuroscience and social science.
According to a standard formal definition, the accuracy of a prediction improves as the 
difference between the expected behavior and the observed behavior diminishes. Predictions 
of network dynamics, system function or other network-based phenotypes can be obtained in 
one of two ways: using black-box approaches such as those afforded by machine learning or 
using first-principles mechanistic models such as those developed in the field of theoretical 
physics. Although the former has rarely been explicitly combined with network 
neuroscience98, the latter has demonstrated initial utility in contexts as far ranging as 
predicting therapeutic targets in cellular regulatory networks99 and predicting seizure 
activity in medically refractory epilepsy100. These successes depend on a fundamental 
understanding of the network interactions and the energy landscape defining how the brain 
moves between different states101, which predict not only common brain states, but also the 
probability of transitioning between them. In addition to methodological approaches to 
understanding these landscapes, open areas of inquiry include whether one can predict 
cognitive function from structural or functional network architecture102, predict disease 
onset or progression from early or pre-clinical data103, predict behavioral responses to health 
messaging104, or predict optimal strategies for early intervention.
Perturbation, manipulation and control
Once a predictive model of a system is built, one has the potential to carefully perturb, 
manipulate and indeed control the system with an explicit knowledge of the outcome (Fig. 
5). Network neuroscience is poised to offer a new conceptual and computational framework

 in which to guide these interventions in a theoretically principled manner for maximal 
cognitive enhancement or therapeutic benefit.
Here we take an eclectic view of what constitutes an intervention by including optogenetics, 
brain stimulation, lesions, neurofeedback, mood induction, task priming, training and task 
performance. What each of these manipulations has in common is the fact that they can be 
used to perturb (or change) brain state and its associated dynamics. Although this has been 
acknowledged for many decades, it has begun to be exploited to address explicitly network-
based hypotheses105. For example, what network do we wish to (in)activate? And at what 
spatial scale does this network operate, or at what spatial scale does this network go awry, 
for example, in the case of epilepsy (Fig. 6a–c)? What effect will focal perturbations have on 
network function106 or network reconfiguration? Is there a predictable pattern of network 
recovery following disturbances resulting from stroke or other injury107?
The ability to conceptualize network-based hypotheses, coupled with the growing potential 
to modulate neural function across many spatial scales108, brings with it important 
engineering challenges109. How do we titrate the location, strength or spatiotemporal extent 
of a perturbation? How do we model the relative contributions of network structure and 
dynamics on the functional effects of perturbations? Drawing on the wealth of knowledge 
gleaned across the ancient field of physics, one realizes that one can only hope to answer 
these translational questions when one is able to construct a meaningful network-based 
theory of brain function. A particularly promising example of such a theory lies in network 
control, a nascent field of engineering that has its roots in the 1970s110 and has been re-
popularized more recently111. Network control combines estimates of network connectivity 
with models of system dynamics to predict where in the system one should inject energy to 
push the system toward a desired target state or target dynamics112. Such a theory offers the 
fundamental backdrop against which to better understand cognitive control113, optimize 
stimulation for neurological disorders114, maintain and control levels of anesthesia115, and 
inform surgical or stimulation-based interventions such as in the case of epilepsy116 (Fig. 
6d,e). Future efforts in using network neuroscience for translational purposes will hinge on 
the development of this or related theories to predict the effects of perturbations on network 
structure and function.
Crossing levels
Comprehensive multi-scale accounts of brain function are central objectives for 
neuroscience2, but how can such an understanding be achieved? Networks are not only 
encountered at virtually all scales of neurobiological systems, they also offer a promising 
theoretical and analytical framework for bridging these scales and for creating new insights 
about species commonalities and differences. A case in point is the potential for network 
models to facilitate integration across micro-, meso- and macro-connectomics. As discussed 
earlier, improvements in accuracy and scalability of macroconnectome data acquisition and 
analysis may soon yield large-scale dense reconstructions of neural circuitry at the 
ultrastructural level (for example, see ref. 15). In parallel, statistics on cell types, laminar 
profiles, connection probabilities, etc. can inform detailed circuit models with substantial 
gains in scale and coverage117–119. A combination of dense reconstruction and

 computational inference could then be used to construct cellular-resolution models of brain 
areas and eventually entire brain systems. Another case in point is the application of network 
approaches to the comparison of networks across species120. Thus far, comparative studies 
have revealed some important commonalities (for example, shared attributes such as 
modules and hubs), but have also highlighted differences, such as in the organization of 
inter-areal connectivity in the cerebral cortex of several primate species121,122. In future 
studies bridging scales and species, increasingly sophisticated network science approaches 
for graph modeling, dimensionality reduction and community detection, and extensions into 
multigraphs and spatial networks, will be important adjuncts.
Another bridge is that between structure and function, as illustrated above in the emerging 
frontier of network dynamics. Networks from connectomics provide a structural skeleton of 
physical links among neurons and brain areas: networks created by dynamic brain activity, 
although constrained by the anatomical couplings, form a rich dynamic repertoire of 
topologies that continually change across time. The fundamental role of structural 
constraints in defining a ‘sub-space’ or manifold for brain dynamics is encountered in 
mesoscale neuronal circuits as well as in large-scale brain networks. In circuits, the 
computational roles and capacities of neurons are defined by network connectivity. In larger 
systems, coherently active networks and their fluctuations across time are shaped by 
anatomical projections. It must be noted that topology alone is insufficient to account for all 
of the observed variance, as the biophysical attributes of nodes and edges have a major role 
in shaping neural activation and coactivation. Network science offers a set of tools 
specifically designed to capture different domains of network organization. For example, 
multiplex or multilayer networks can represent structural and functional connectivity in a 
single network model123. Computational models of network architecture allow simulations 
of collective network states and network dynamics across scales from neuronal populations 
to the whole brain72,80,82,118,119. Models of this kind can become useful tools for predicting 
the effects of manipulations and perturbations on network function, from simulating genetic 
knockout experiments to rewiring of circuits, stimulation of specific cell types, effects of 
brain lesions, and varying conditions of neuromodulation and sensory input.
Networks can also bridge across data of very different types and from different domains of 
biology. One example is the joint investigation of gene coexpression patterns and patterns of 
brain connectivity (Fig. 7). Studies in the rodent nervous system have demonstrated that 
brain areas with similar gene transcription also maintain similar connectivity profiles124, and 
that transcriptional patterns are more similar among pairs of areas that are directly 
anatomically connected than among unconnected pairs125. In human cerebral cortex, 
transcription patterns are more similar in coherently active functional networks126 and 
exhibit correlations with activity levels observed during rest127. Transcriptional profiles also 
exhibit relationships with the topological roles of brain areas in the macroscale connectome. 
In the mouse brain, highly connected and highly central areas exhibit a common and distinct 
topological profile, specifically involving genes regulating oxidative metabolism, suggestive 
of links between network topology and metabolic demand128. A separate study found 
evidence of elevated expression of genes associated with cognition, learning and memory in 
hub nodes of the mouse brain129. These studies raise important questions about the nature of

 the mechanisms that tie the topology of structural and functional brain networks to 
fundamental aspects of basic brain physiology.
Finally, crossing levels with the aid of network science is particularly salient when 
considering the multiple markers, mechanisms and manifestations of brain disorders. For 
example, autism spectrum disorders are associated with numerous genetic risk factors, 
disturbed connectivity among brain regions and heterogeneous behavioral phenotypes130. 
More complete understanding of autism etiology requires integration across genetic, 
neuroimaging and phenotypic data131. Here, concepts from multilayer multiscale network 
science will likely be of use. Tracking cross-level interactions among networks may also 
offer new approaches for therapeutic intervention and manipulation. For example, a recent 
meta-analysis suggested a possible association between aspects of social relationships and 
cognitive decline132. Mechanisms of brain networks and social networks become 
intertwined (Fig. 8) in phenomena, such as social cognition, that appear to be disturbed in a 
range of psychiatric conditions133, and in the history of environmental exposures and 
experiences that constitute human development134. Notably, interactions between levels 
occur not only from micro- to macroscales, but can also result in top-down causal effects of 
macro- on micro-scales. For example, genomic profiles and patterns of gene expression can 
be sensitively influenced by environmental perturbations135 or patterns of behavior136. Such 
links across levels of networks become critical when considering complex real-world 
problems such as those posed by the design of effective interventions and treatments in the 
context of public health137. They are also attractive targets for future investigation 
employing quantitative tools and methods from network neuroscience.
Network science tools are perfectly suited to accomplish the important goal of crossing 
levels or scales of organization, integrating diverse data sets, and bridging existing disparate 
analyses. For example, the multilayer formalism recently developed in the field of applied 
mathematics88 provides a principled way in which two different imaging modalities that 
each provide estimates of connectivity between the same nodes, such as structural 
connections and functional connections, can be linked. The same multilayer network 
formalism can also be used to link data across different levels of spatial scale, where a node 
in one layer at a large spatial scale becomes a collection of nodes in the next layer at a 
smaller spatial scale. The multilayer framework allows the collection of statistics of network 
characteristics that are conserved or variable across modalities or across scales. Another 
important set of tools, annotated graphs— sometimes also called decorated graphs in 
mathematics—provide a means of assigning attributes to nodes138. In an annotated graph, a 
brain region can be characterized by inter-nodal relationships (for example, edges) as well as 
intra-nodal characteristics (for example, gene expression levels, cytoarchitectural properties, 
activity magnitudes or morphological features). Statistics can then be used to capture the 
relationships between connectivity and nodal characteristics in a model-based manner. 
Notably, this annotated graph approach can be used to bridge common analytical approaches 
that focus on nodal properties, including both univariate and multivariate approaches, and 
the emerging analytical approaches from graph theory that focus on inter-nodal 
relationships. Finally, whether crossing scales, integrating data or bridging analyses, network 
science also offers tools to capture higher order structure in data, including multi-omics data,

Conclusion
In this review, we have attempted to sketch the outlines of a new interdisciplinary field, 
which we call network neuroscience. The field gathers momentum as networks have become 
ubiquitous phenomena encountered in empirical investigation as well as computational 
analysis and modeling of neurobiological systems at all scales. The ever-growing volume of 
big data in neuroscience demands not only advanced analytics and sound statistical 
inference, but it also calls for theoretical ideas that can unify our understanding of brain 
structure and function. Theory is indispensable, as it allows us to transform big data into 
‘small data’ and, ultimately, knowledge—delivering compact descriptions of regularities, 
principles and laws that apply to the architecture and functioning of neural systems. We 
believe that network neuroscience can make an important contribution toward unifying an 
otherwise fractured discipline by providing a common conceptual framework and a common 
toolset to meet the challenges of modern neuroscience. Network neuroscience naturally 
connects with other important theoretical approaches such as dynamical systems, neural 
coding and statistical physics.
Effectively bridging network theory and empirical neuroscience will require new educational 
initiatives and training programs that provide strong grounding in both disciplines. If these 
goals can be accomplished, the network neuroscientist of the future will be in an excellent 
position to add to our understanding of the network mechanisms that underpin brain 
structure and function.

 Figure 1. 
Networks on multiple spatial and temporal scales. Network neuroscience encompasses the 
study of very different networks encountered across many spatial and temporal scales. 
Starting from the smallest elements, network neuroscience seeks to bridge information 
encoded in the relationships between genes and biomolecules to the information shared 
between neurons. It seeks to build a mechanistic understanding of how neuron-level 
processes give rise to the structure and function of large-scale circuits, brain systems and 
whole-brain structure and function. However, network neuroscience does not stop at the 
brain, but instead asks how these patterns of interconnectivity in the CNS drive and interact 
with patterns of behavior: how perception and action are mutually linked and how brain-
environment interactions influence cognition. Finally, network neuroscience asks how all of 
these levels of inquiry help us to understand the interactions between social beings that give 
rise to ecologies, economies and cultures. Rather than reducing systems to a list of parts 
defined at a particular scale, network neuroscience embraces the complexity of the 
interactions between the parts and acknowledges the dependence of phenomena across 
scales. Box dimensions give outer bounds of the spatial and temporal scales at which 
relational data are measured and interactions unfold, and over which networks exhibit 
characteristic variations and dynamic changes. Inspired by an iconic image of neuroscience 
recording methods, last updated in ref. 1. ECOG, intracranial electrocorticography; EEG, 
electroencephalography; fMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging; fNIRS, functional 
near-infrared spectroscopy; MEG, magnetoencephalography.

Network measurement, construction and analysis. Top, network neuroscience begins with 
the collection of relational data among elements of a neurobiological system. These data 
may refer to statistical associations among genes, physical binding events among 
macromolecules, anatomical networks of synaptic connections or inter-regional projections, 
multi-dimensional time series and their statistical dependencies or causal relations, or links 
in behavior, such as dynamic couplings among sensors and effectors in individuals or 
collective social interactions. Middle, once collected, relational data are generally subject to 
normalization, artifact and noise reduction before being assembled into the mathematical 
form of a graph or network, consisting of nodes (elements) and edges (their relations). 
Common examples are transcriptome and interactome networks, connectomes, networks of 
functional and effective connectivity, and social networks. Bottom, the common 
mathematical framework of graph theory offers a set of measures and tools for network 
analysis. As we argue in this review, descriptive measures such as the ones shown here are 
but a first step toward more powerful analysis and modeling approaches, such as generative 
modeling, prediction and control. Finally, network data are generally shared in large 
repositories, and numerous follow-up tool kits allow sophisticated visualization and 
simulation. Continual refinement of measurement, construction and analysis techniques

Algebraic topology and simplicial complexes. (a) Left, the traditional way in which to study 
networked systems including the brain is to examine patterns in pairwise relationships 
between nodes (dyads). Indeed, the dyad has traditionally been the fundamental unit of 
interest in graph theory and network science. Here we show an example brain network, 
composed exclusively of dyads. Right, in many cases, however, neural systems appear to 
employ higher order interactions139, which increase the complexity of neural codes that 
produce the wide range of behaviors observed in these systems140. To study these higher 
order interactions, one must expand one’s worldview to include units of interest that exceed 
the simple dyad. Using recent advances in the field of applied algebraic topology, we can 
study so-called simplicial complexes, which are generalizations of graphs that encode non-
dyadic relationships63. Here we show representations of a zero-simplex (a node), a one-
simplex (an edge between two nodes), a two-simplex (a filled triangle), etc. (b) Left, we can 
study the location of these simplices in brain networks, from the small scale of neurons to 
the large scale of brain regions. For example, we show a toy simplicial complex embedded 
in the human brain, and containing a zero-simplex, several one-simplices, a two-simplex and 
a three-simplex. Right, when doing so, it is interesting to characterize the locations of 
cliques (all-to-all connected subgraphs of any size) and cavities (a collection of n-simplices 
that are arranged so that they have an empty geometric boundary), which are structurally 
predisposed to be critical for in integrated (cliques) versus segregated (cavities) codes and 
computations. Here we show a two-clique (top) and a cavity bounded by four one-simplices 
(bottom). (c) It is also often interesting to study how networks evolve in time or how their 
internal structure depends on the weight of the edges between nodes. In these and similar 
scenarios, we can apply a powerful tool from algebraic topology called a filtration, which 
can represent a weighted simplicial complex as a series of unweighted simplicial complexes. 
We can then trace the evolution of specific cavities from one complex (one time point or one 
edge weight value) to another, as well as locate the moment of their creation or collapse. 
Collectively, this is called the persistent homology of the weighted simplicial complex, and 
it can be statistically quantified using a collection of functions called Betti curves, which 
record the number of cavities in each dimension. Here we show a filtration on edge weight, 
which begins with all nodes being disconnected because no edges exceed a threshold value

 τ. At subsequent points along the filtration, those nodes are connected by simplices that are 
composed of edges of weight greater than or equal to τ. This same sort of structure can be 
observed in a filtration of a growing network over time: the filtration begins with all nodes 
being disconnected because no edges exist. At subsequent points along the filtration, those 
nodes are connected by simplices that are composed of edges that have grown at later time 
points. Thus, filtrations allow the investigator to assess the organization of weighted 
simplicial complex representations of brain structure and dynamics as a function of edge 
weight, or as a function of time.

Dynamic and multilayer networks. In the field of network science, two types of dynamic 
processes are studied in some detail: dynamics on networks and dynamics of networks. (a) 
Dynamics on networks indicates that the activity (or some other property of interest) of 
nodes changes as a function of time. Here we illustrate decreasing activity (pink), increasing 
activity (gray) and changes in the pattern of activity (blue) over time in distinct network 
modules or communities. (b) Dynamics of networks indicates that the edges of the network 
themselves change either in their existence/absence or in their strength. Here we illustrate 
the coalescence of modules (blue and yellow), as well as the transfer of allegiance of a single 
region from one module (pink) to another (yellow) over time. This latter process can be 
quantified using the statistic of network flexibility, and has been shown to be an important 
indicator of human learning141 and a correlate of individual differences in executive 
function142. (c) Although not yet common, studies addressing the combined problem of 
dynamics on and of networks will be of increasing importance in the coming years. There is 
a critical need to better understand the relationships between changes in connectivity and 
changes in activity, gray matter, neurotransmitter levels, genetic expression or other nodal 
properties. Methods to bridge these scales will be critical in advancing network neuroscience 
toward more mechanistic models and insights. (d) One particularly useful construct in the 
context of dynamic and multimodal networks is that of multilayer networks88. Multilayer 
networks are networks whose nodes may be connected by different types of edges, with each 
type being encoded in a different layer90. These layers could, for example, represent 
different time points, subjects, tasks, brain states, ages or imaging modalities. In multilayer 
networks, nodes in one layer are connected to corresponding nodes in other layers by 
identity links (a distinct sort of edge), which hardcode the non-independence of data

 obtained from these nodes. Here we show the simplest case in which all nodes and all edges 
exist in all layers, but multilayer network tools can also be used in cases in which nodes and 
edges change across layers. We also illustrate the simplest inter-layer connection pattern, 
with identity links connecting consecutive layers; however, alternative connection patterns 
are possible59.

Controlling brain networks. Following a careful description of the network properties of the 
brain, we might wish to intervene: to push a diseased brain toward health or to enhance the 
function of a brain that might not be reaching its full potential. In the context of brain 
networks, this question becomes has provided a question of so-called ‘network control’, for 
which the field of engineering extensive and carefully validated solutions in recent years112. 
(a,b) Here we illustrate a problem in which we wish to modulate the activity of three brain 
regions (blue, peach, gold; a) that are connected both to one another and to other regions in 
the brain by aset of anatomical links of varying strength or weight (b). (c,d) We wish to 
determine the amount of control energy (which can take the form of brain stimulation or task 
demands) that must be injected into brain regions at each time point (c) to affect a 
continuous change in the amplitude of the three brain regions of interest from a (d), moving 
them from an initial state characterized by one pattern of activation to a target state 
characterized by a different pattern of activation. One way to address this problem is to 
model brain dynamics as a (linear or nonlinear) function of an initial state x, a structural 
adjacency matrix A and a control energy matrix C. Using techniques from network control 
theory, we can solve for the optimal control energy, which is usually defined as the smallest 
amount of energy required to affect the transition (from initial to final state) in a given time 
period T. Interesting problems include determining which regions can affect which types of 
control113, which regions form optimal targets or optimal drivers143, how many control 
points are required, and which transitions are preferredby the system. In many cases, the best 
model of dynamics is unknown, and in this case an engineering technique known as systems 
identification can be very useful; this technique reveals not only the model of dynamics, but 
also the structural matrix A that best explains regional time series. Note that the a matrix 
uncovered by systems identification might not be identical to an anatomical matrix of 
synaptic connections. In the coming years, we anticipate that these techniques, and their 
careful adaptions to neural systems, will prove to be particularly useful in the control of

 (bottom), whereby a regulatory network outside of the seizure generating zone controls the 
spread of seizure activity (top). These data provide two distinct targets for surgical and 
stimulation-based intervention: the seizure-generating zone, and the seizure-regulating zone. 
Reproduced from ref. 116, Elsevier. (e) Exogenously controlling the dynamics in either of 
these zones using stimulation requires careful computational models of control mechanisms, 
optimal stimulation intensities and optimal targets of that stimulation as a function of time. 
For example, here we illustrate recent work that models these large-scale dynamics using 
Wilson-Cowan oscillators. A distributed control mechanism, in which control is enacted by 
all stimulation sites, may be useful for quieting seizure activity, particularly when the 
underlying structural network is relatively random (top). However, when the underlying 
structural connectivity displays a small-world organization, a blanket distributed control 
mechanism is less effective, and may instead need to be better tuned to control drivers in the 
regulatory or seizure-generating networks (bottom). Reprinted with permission from ref. 148

Relations among anatomical connectivity and gene co-expression networks. Top left, matrix 
of anatomical connections among 213 mouse brain regions. Regions (nodes) with more than 
44 distinct connections were considered hubs, and connections were classified as hub→hub 
(rich), hub→nonhub (feeder) or nonhub→nonhub (peripheral). Bottom left, normalized 
expression levels of 17,642 genes across 213 brain regions. Genes with highly correlated 
expression profiles are placed near each other. Right, brain regions have been arranged 
around a circle, ordered by number of connections (bars) in each anatomical subdivision. 
Hubs are marked by red bars. The connection diagram traces anatomical connections 
between pairs of brain regions, color-coded by the corresponding gene coexpression value, 
after applying a correction for spatial distance. Statistical analysis revealed strongest gene 
coexpression among pairs of regions linked by reciprocal connections (as compared with 
unidirectional or unconnected pairs), as well as for rich connections linking hubs (as 
compared with feeder and peripheral connections). Genes driving correlations in expression 
in connections involving hub regions are functionally enriched in oxidative energy 
metabolism. Connectivity data derived from ref. 18. Reproduced from ref. 128, National

Crossing scales from brain networks to social networks. (a–c) As we interact with one 
another, our patterns of brain activity can track together, whether in a single voxel (a; inter-
subject correlations), from a single voxel to other voxels (b; inter-subject functional 
correlation) or from any voxel to any other voxel (c; inter-subject functional covariance). 
These patterns can be studied from a network perspective using the tools of graph theory to 
better understand how relationships between individuals affect the similarities and 
differences in our patterns of brain activity. Taking the idea one step further, we can study 
how the patterns of brain activity in a person who is central in their social network differ 
from the patterns of brain activity in a person who is less central to their social network. 
Indeed, how our brains respond to or can be predicted from our social networks is a critical 
open question with direct import for health interventions at the large-scale of neighborhoods, 
cities, countries, and cultures (see also ref. 137). a–c adapted from ref. 149, Springer Nature,
