Introduction: Sleep deprivation can impair several physiological systems and recently,
new evidence has pointed to the relationship between a lack of sleep and carbohydrate
metabolism, consequently resulting in insulin resistance. To minimize this effect,
High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) is emerging as a potential strategy.
Objective:
The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of HIIT on insulin
resistance induced by sleep deprivation.
Method:
Eleven healthy male volunteers were recruited, aged 18–35 years, who
declared taking 7–8 h sleep per night. All volunteers were submitted to four different
conditions: a single night of regular sleep (RS condition), 24 h of total sleep deprivation
(SD condition), HIIT training followed by regular sleep (HIIT+RS condition), and HIIT
training followed by 24 h of total sleep deprivation (HIIT+SD condition). They performed
six training sessions over 2 weeks and each session consisted of 8–12 × 60 s intervals
at 100% of peak power output. In each experimental condition, tests for glucose, insulin,
cortisol, free fatty acids, and insulin sensitivity, measured by oral glucose tolerance test
(OGTT), were performed.
Results: Sleep deprivation increased glycaemia and insulin levels, as well as the area
under the curve. Furthermore, an increase in free fatty acids concentrations and basal
metabolism was observed. There were no differences in the concentrations of cortisol.
However, HIIT before 24 h of sleep deprivation attenuated the increase of glucose, insulin,
and free fatty acids.
Conclusion: Twenty-four hours of sleep deprivation resulted in acute insulin resistance.
However, HIIT is an effective strategy to minimize the deleterious effects promoted by
this condition.

HIIT and Sleep Deprivation
INTRODUCTION
The decrease in total sleep time, the increase in sleep complaints
and consequently, sleep deprivation are more frequent nowadays
(Santos-Silva et al., 2010). Several studies show that sleep is able
to influence the responses of β pancreatic cells and the sensitivity
of tissues to insulin (Ip and Mokhlesi, 2007; Knutson et al., 2007).
On the other hand, lack of sleep can negatively influence glucose
homeostasis resulting in insulin resistance (González-Ortiz et al.,
2000; Tasali et al., 2008; Nedeltcheva et al., 2009; Buxton et al.,
2010; Donga et al., 2010; Klingenberg et al., 2013).
Among the strategies that can minimize the negative impact
of insulin resistance, regular physical exercise emerges as a
non-pharmacological strategy offering health benefits for the
general population (Garber et al., 2011) and acts directly on the
regulation of glucose metabolism from acute and chronic effects,
activating the insulin signaling pathway and the independent
pathway of insulin action (Lima et al., 2009; Pauli et al., 2009).
In this scenario, High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) appears
to be a time-efficient strategy capable of providing the same
benefits as traditional moderate-intensity continuous exercise but
with less expenditure of practice time. The effects are related
to increased insulin sensitivity and improved glycaemic control
(Babraj et al., 2009; Richards et al., 2010).
Modern society is becoming increasingly fast-paced, and the
time devoted to sleep and physical exercise is correspondingly
limited, thus HIIT could be beneficial in reversing or minimizing
the change in glucose metabolism caused by sleep deprivation.
Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of HIIT
on insulin resistance as a result of sleep deprivation. The initial
hypothesis was that people deprived of sleep for 24 h following
a 2-week period of HIIT, would suffer less from the deleterious
effects of sleep debt.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eleven healthy and physically active young men were recruited
by advertisements in flyers, radio, newspaper, and social network
website. The subjects were selected for the study based on the
following inclusion criteria: (a) male gender; (b) aged between
18 and 30 years; (c) physically active (aerobic modalities for
least 2 years, 5x/week); (d) habitual sleep for 7–8 h/night; (e)
regular eating habits; (f) no cardiovascular disease, diabetes
mellitus, or impaired glucose tolerance; (g) no physical injuries
or disabilities; (h) non-smoker; (i) consuming no more than
2 doses/day of alcohol and no more than 4 doses on a
single occasion; (j) no chronic use of anti-inflammatory and
antilipidemic medications; (k) no sleep disorders; and (l) no
alterations on the electrocardiogram at rest and during exercise.
Before participating, all volunteers were informed of the
procedures, discomfort, and risks involved in the evaluation
process. This study was carried out in accordance with the
recommendations of the ethics committee of institution with
written informed consent from all subjects. All subjects gave
written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration
of Helsinki. The Committee of Ethics in Research of the
Universidade Federal de São Paulo/Hospital São Paulo approved
the study (#522.163) and the study was registered at Clinical
Trials (NCT02125656).
Experimental Design
During their first visit to the laboratory and before initiating
the protocol, all volunteers underwent a clinical evaluation
that included a resting electrocardiogram and an ergometric
test, all conducted by a specialist doctor, including a thorough
explanation of study procedures and the completion of
the informed consent form. After these evaluations, only
those subjects considered healthy participated in the study.
During their second visit, volunteers received a full overnight,
attended
polysomnography
using
a
computerized
system
(EMBLA R
�S7000, Embla Systems, Inc., Broomfield. CO, USA).
Following the night that the PSG was performed, four sleep
questionnaires (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep
Quality Index, UNIFESP Sleep Questionnaire and Mini-Sleep
Questionnaire) were applied to complement the evaluation of the
sleep profile. These questionnaires were chosen to complement
the information obtained by polysomnography examination,
reporting excessive daytime sleepiness, subjective perception of
sleep quality, sleep habits and complaint events. The instruments
are validated for the Brazilian population. In addition, each
volunteer provided blood samples and an OGTT was performed.
Each volunteer was instructed in the use of a Motionlogger
Actigraph Watch R
� (Ambulatory Monitoring Inc., Ardsley,
NY, USA), to be worn for 7 days preceding each experimental
condition, to evaluate the sleep-wake cycle and registration of
motor activity from the movements member.
After
completing
all
evaluations,
the
volunteers
were
considered ready to start the experiment.
Experimental Protocol
All volunteers were submitted to four different conditions:
Regular Sleep (RS), Sleep Deprivation (SD), HIIT+Regular Sleep
(HIIT+RS), and HIIT+Sleep Deprivation (HIIT+SD).
In RS condition, subjects had a regular night’s sleep for 8 h.
After waking-up, they were submitted to blood analyses and
OGTT.
In SD condition, subjects were submitted to 24 consecutive
hours of sleep deprivation. Throughout this period, the
volunteers had access to television, music and video games, and
fasted during the night. In the morning, at same time as other
experiments, blood samples were taken for analysis and an OGTT
was carried out.
In HIIT+RS condition, subjects trained for 2 weeks, and
after the last day of training, had a regular night’s sleep. After
waking-up, full blood analyses and an OGTT were carried out.
After a 1-month washout period, all volunteers returned to
the labs to start HIIT+SD condition. They repeated the training
protocol and immediately after training finished, the volunteers
were deprived of sleep for 24 consecutive hours and in the
morning, full blood analyses, and OGTT were performed (see
Figure 1).

questionnaire had been previously translated into Portuguese
and validated for use by Brazilian participants (Matsudo et al.,
2001). Questions related to the activities undertaken in the
previous week. Volunteers answered 9 questions about walking
frequency and duration, the frequency of taking moderate or
vigorous physical activity, and estimates of sedentary time per 7-
day week. The physical activity level was categorized using the
recommendations established by the World Health Organization
(Guilbert, 2003). Participants were considered physically active
if they performed at least 150 min of physical activity per
week (including time spent at work, traveling to/from work,
household chores, and leisure time). Participants who performed
between 10 and 149 min of physical activity were considered
moderately active, and those who performed <10 min per week
were classified as insufficiently active.
Epworth Sleepiness Scale—used to assess daytime sleepiness,
this scale assesses the probability of dozing off in eight everyday
situations by means of a scale ranging from 0 (= would never
doze) to 3 (= high chance of dozing). Scores >10 are considered
as elevated and clinically significant (Bertolazi et al., 2009).
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index—used to assess sleep quality
over the previous month. A total of 18 items, each scored from
0 to 3, generate different subscales: subjective sleep quality,
sleep onset latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep
disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction.
The total score is calculated by summing all subscale scores with
a total of >5 indicating “bad sleepers,” in comparison to <5
for “good sleepers.” A total score >10 indicates a several sleep
problems or sleep disorders (Bertolazi et al., 2011).
UNIFESP Sleep Questionnaire—used to evaluate sleep habits
and sleep complaints (Pires et al., 2007).
Mini-Sleep
Questionnaire—a
self-reported
questionnaire
about current sleep quality, which is has ten questions about
the frequency of sleep difficulties. Answer options range from 1
(never) to 7 (always). The total score is classified into good sleep
(10–24), mild sleep difficulties (25–27), moderate difficulties
(28–30), and severe difficulties (>30) (Falavigna et al., 2011).
Training
The training protocol was based on the work of Little et al. (2010),
which consists of four phases: maximal test, pre-training test, 2
weeks of HIIT and post-training tests.
Maximal Test
Incremental exercise was performed until maximum volitional
exhaustion, using a cycle ergometer (Excalibur Sport 925900,
Lode BV, Groningen, The Netherlands), in a set hyperbolic mode
to determine VO2peak. In this protocol, the initial load was set
at 70 W and then increased by 35 W every 2 min. Throughout
the test, volunteers were verbally encouraged and required to
maintain a minimum rate of 70 RPM. Ventilatory parameters
were obtained by measuring respiratory gas exchange with a
metabolic system (Quark PFT 4 Ergo, COSMED R
�, Rome, Italy).
Pre-training Tests
Two days after the maximal test, the volunteers performed
two time-trial cycling tests, separated by 48 h. They were
instructed to complete the test as quickly as possible without
verbal encouragement or physiological feedback. They had visual
feedback only about the distance that appeared on the computer
monitor. At the end of each test, the result was presented in units
of distance, rather than work completed (4 km was displayed to
represent 100 kJ, and 30 km was displayed to represent 750 kJ).
The ergometer was set to linear mode, so that the resistance
increased proportionally to cadence and force.
Training
Three days after the tests, the volunteers started a training
protocol that consisted of six sessions over 2 weeks (Mondays,
Wednesdays, and Fridays). Each training session consisted
of repeated efforts of high-intensity cycling at a workload
corresponding to VO2peak (peak power) for 60 s. These sprints
were interspersed with an active recovery of 75 s at low intensity
(30 W). Each day, before training began, 3 min of warm-up at
30 W was performed. The subjects completed 8 high-intensity
intervals during the first two training sessions, 10 intervals during
third and fourth sessions, and 12 intervals during the final two
sessions. All volunteers completed all training sessions without
complications.
Post-training Tests
Seventy-two hours after the final training session, volunteers were
submitted to two time-trial tests 48 h apart.
Oral Glucose Tolerance Test
After an 8 h overnight fast, subjects ingested 75 g of anhydrous
glucose dissolved in 300 ml water (GlucUp 75, lemon flavor,
Newprov, Pinhais, Brazil). Plasma glucose and plasma insulin
levels were tested at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min.
Food Diary
All participants were instructed to maintain their regular eating
habits during the study period. To obtain this control, volunteers
completed a food diary every day during the training period.
The diaries were analyzed quantitatively by calculating energy,
macronutrients, and micronutrients, using NutWin-UNIFESP
software. The food diary was adopted as a self-control tool for
participants’ diets, and the data were presented as mean kcal of
the training period.
Biochemical Analysis
Blood collection was conducted early in the morning after
a fasting period, by surface puncture of the forearm vein,
with the volunteers in a seated position. The samples were
centrifuged to separate the plasma and serum and were then
stored at −80◦C until the time of analysis. Insulin and cortisol
were determined using immunoassay system (Unicel R
� DxI800,
Access R
�, Beckman Coulter R
�), blood glucose was analyzed by
the colorimetric/enzymatic assay (Unicel R
� DxI 800, Access R
�,
Beckman Coulter R
�) and an analysis of free fatty acids (FFA) was
performed using spectrophotometry.
Statistical Analysis
The Shapiro–Wilk test was applied to determine whether the
distribution curve was normal. The results are expressed as the

(SEM). The data were compared using General Linear Model
(GLM) with Newman Keuls post-hoc test or Student’s t-test
when necessary. The significance level was set at P ≤ 0.05.
Statistical analyses were performed using Statistica 12.7 for
Windows (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, USA). Specialist software was
used for the calculation of the area under the curve (AUC)

RESULTS
Table 1 presents the descriptive analysis data of the sample
regarding age, height, body mass, and body mass index
(BMI), the data obtained by the International Physical Activity
Questionnaire (IPAQ), and the analyses of the food diaries filled
in by volunteers during the training periods presented as average
calories and macronutrients consumed per day. It is a sample
composed of eutrophic young people, sufficiently active and with
a balanced diet.
Table 2 shows the data of the volunteers, obtained from the
actigraph (average of variables taken over a period of 1 week),
sleep questionnaire and polysomnography. The results show that
the volunteers had good sleep quality, lasting more than 7 h
per night. All sleep stages were preserved, respiratory indices
remained within the normal range, and there were no reports of
daytime sleepiness.

30–90 min (P < 0.01) when compared to baseline moment, and
began to return to baseline values after 120 min (P < 0.01). In the
HIIT+RS condition [F(4.28) = 9.76, P < 0.01, η2 = 0.99], insulin
was elevated for up to 60 min (P < 0.01) and returned to baseline
values after 90 min (P = 0.04). In the HIIT+SD condition [F(4.32)
= 5.61, P < 0.01, η2 = 0.95], insulin was elevated for up to
60 min (P < 0.01) and returned to baseline values after 90 min
(P = 0.04).
Figure 3B presents the results of insulin AUC during the
OGTT. The insulin AUC [F(3.18) = 4.57; P = 0.01; η2 = 0.80]
in SD was higher than other conditions (P = 0.02).
Calculations were performed: HOMA-IR Index [F(3.35) =
0.66; p = 0.97; η2 = 0.84; RS = 1.03 ± 0.48; SD = 0.96 ± 0.47;
HIIT+RS = 1.02 ± 0.43; HIIT+SD = 0.97 ± 0.40] and Matsuda
Index (ISI) [F(3.35) = 1.38; p = 0.26; η2 = 0.80; RS = 16.69 ±
8.23; SD = 10.98 ± 6.73; HIIT+RS = 11.92 ± 3.42; HIIT+SD
= 13.35 ± 7.25]. However, there were no differences when the
experimental conditions were compared.
Figure 4 shows the FFA and Cortisol concentrations. FFA
[F(3.21) = 3.34, P = 0.03, η2 = 0.67] had the highest
concentration in the SD condition compared to RS condition
(P = 0.02; Figure 4A), while Cortisol [F(3.21) = 0.72, P = 0.54,
η2 = 0.17] showed no significant differences between groups
(Figure 4B).
Figure 5 presents the performance data obtained in the
tests against the time-trials tests. In HIIT+RS condition,
the volunteers achieved faster times in 4 km time-trial test
(Figure 5A; t = 2.53, P = 0.03), while there were no differences
when compared pre- and post-training in 30 km time-trial test
(Figure 5C). In HIIT+SD condition, the volunteers achieved
faster times in both 4 km (Figure 5E; t = 3.43, P < 0.01) and
30 km (Figure 5G; t = 2.79, P = 0.02) time-trial tests.
DISCUSSION
The main findings of this study show that HIIT was effective in
reversing the effects of sleep deprivation on glucose metabolism
for 24 h, especially the improvement in levels of FFA, glycaemia
and insulin during OGTT, suggesting that those who practice
HIIT are not affected by the stress of sleep deprivation.

the tissues (Spiegel et al., 1999; González-Ortiz et al., 2000;
Nedeltcheva et al., 2009; Donga et al., 2010), accompanied by
reduced sensitivity of tissues to insulin (VanHelder et al., 1993;
Tasali et al., 2008; Buxton et al., 2010; Klingenberg et al., 2013), is
observed in different sleep deprivation protocols.
Changes in glucose metabolism following a period of sleep
deprivation can be explained by decreased phosphorylation of
PI3K/Akt that is closely linked to insulin signaling (Broussard
et al., 2012). Literature shows that the increased activation of
the HPA axis due to the stress of sleep debt, can influence

HIIT and Sleep Deprivation
the release of insulin to maintain normal glucose levels. Thus,
increased cortisol is able to influence the response of glucose
and insulin (Trenell et al., 2007) and sleep debt can increase
serum concentrations of cortisol (Nedeltcheva et al., 2009;
Buxton et al., 2010; Joo et al., 2012). This leads to activation of
enzymes responsible for serine phosphorylation of both receptor
substrates and proteins that participate in the transmission of
the signal for translocation of the carrier to the membrane.
This, in turn, blocks the transmission of the insulin signal and
prevents the uptake of glucose into the cell (Leahy et al., 1986;
Riboulet-Chavey et al., 2006). However, the results of this study
appear to disprove the possibility that sleep debt can increase
serum concentrations of cortisol, since this study found no
differences in cortisol levels among the groups studied. Cortisol
is a circadian hormone and its concentrations vary throughout
the day (Michaud et al., 2009; Hayes et al., 2010). The lack
of sequential samples of this hormone taken, and the time of
collections (early morning), could explain the conflicting results.
Another possible explanation for this phenomenon is due to
increased levels of FFA. The activation of the Central Nervous
System can stimulate lipolysis, increasing the release of FFA
into the bloodstream (Trenell et al., 2007). Literature shows
that acute lack of sleep (Donga et al., 2010) or chronic sleep
loss (Nedeltcheva et al., 2012) is able to increase the FFA
levels. Furthermore, the increase of FFA is linked to serine
kinase activation, which blocks the insulin signaling pathway,
resulting in a lower translocation of glucose transporter to the cell
membrane (Schenk et al., 2008). Our study found that in the SD
condition there was an increase of 187.5% in FFA levels compared
to the RS condition, reinforcing the fact that the insulin signaling
pathway is impaired by sleep deprivation and, at least in part,
due to high levels of FFA. This increase can mean a lower
oxidation of fatty acids as an energy source during the agreed
period, resulting in an accumulation of this substrate in the
bloodstream. The mechanisms by which sleep debt increases the
FFA concentrations are still uncertain. However, it is known that
an increase of FFA implies a decrease in glucose uptake by tissues
by a competitive mechanism (Randle, 1998), and the increase in
fatty acids adversely impacts glucose transport (Dresner et al.,
1999). After 4 consecutive nights of sleep restriction, Broussard
et al. (2015) analyzed metabolic variables for 24 h, during which
time there was an increase of 15–30% in FFA concentrations,
especially in the period between 4 and 9 a.m., which coincides
with the timing of collections of this study (between 7 and 8 a.m.).
Effects of HIIT
Several studies show that in addition to improving performance,
HIIT improves glucose metabolism, increases mitochondrial
biogenesis, activity of respiratory chain and β-oxidation, and
also the expression of GLUT4 and PGC-1α–all of which cause
deterioration of insulin resistance (Burgomaster et al., 2005, 2008;
Helgerud et al., 2007; Talanian et al., 2007; Daussin et al., 2008).
In healthy individuals, HIIT is able to increase insulin
sensitivity (Richards et al., 2010), improve the action of insulin
and lower the levels of FFA (Babraj et al., 2009). In individuals
with insulin resistance risk, HIIT improves insulin sensitivity,
increases the maximum oxygen intake, decreases body mass
and body fat percentage (Earnest et al., 2013). In patients with
diabetes mellitus type II, acute HIIT practice decreases glucose
AUC (Gillen et al., 2012).
Considering glucose transporter in skeletal muscle, which is
responsible for the glucose uptake into the muscle cell, several
studies suggest the existence of different intracellular “pools” of
GLUT4, which can be activated by insulin stimulation or exercise.
Recent evidence indicates that these two mechanisms stimulate
the translocation of the transporter to the cell membrane in a
different way (Messina et al., 2015). During muscle contraction,
proteins such as AMPK and Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin
substrate 1 (Rac1) are activated (Rose and Richter, 2005). Once
activated, these proteins initiate a cascade of reactions that lead
to the translocation of GLUT4 to the cell membrane (Richter and
Hargreaves, 2013; Sylow et al., 2013). It is noteworthy that both
the activity of AMPK and Rac1 increases in line with the increase
in exercise intensity (Chen et al., 2003; Gibala et al., 2009; Sylow
et al., 2013), which may partly explain the success of HIIT for
glycaemic control in individuals who have been deprived of sleep.
Besides these factors, PGC1α can also participate directly in the
regulation of GLUT4 expression in muscle cells (Michael et al.,
2001; Baar et al., 2003). As reported in previous studies, HIIT
induces increased AMPK and PGC1α activity, and translocation
of GLUT4 (Burgomaster et al., 2005, 2008; Gibala et al., 2009;
Little et al., 2010; Gillen et al., 2012; Sandvei et al., 2012). It
is therefore suggested that the HIIT practiced by this study’s
volunteers was responsible for mitigating the deleterious changes
arising from sleep deprivation.
In addition to the acute effect of exercise and activation
of insulin-independent mechanisms to increase glucose uptake,
regular physical exercise and its long-term benefits are also
recorded in the insulin signaling pathway (Cartee et al., 1989).
According to previous studies, exercise is able to activate Akt
and improve glycaemic control by insulin receptor and insulin
receptor substrate activation (Kirwan et al., 2000; Wojtaszewski
et al., 2000; Luciano et al., 2002; Krisan et al., 2004), and it was
considered that six sessions of HIIT were enough to cause such
changes and thus improve glycaemic control in those subjects
deprived of sleep.
Exercise, besides helping to improve glucose uptake, may
help to decrease the action of factors that prevent glucose
from entering the cell, as in the case of FFA. The increase
in FFA, as for example, in mitochondrial dysfunction linked
to insulin resistance (Kelley et al., 1999; Gaster et al., 2004),
is associated with increased serine phosphorylation of protein
kinases involved in the insulin pathway (Schenk et al., 2008).
Moreover, exercise may increase mitochondrial biogenesis,
resulting in increased performance as well as in the treatment of
chronic diseases (Joseph and Hood, 2014), and more specifically,
HIIT has been described as the only training mode capable
of increasing mitochondrial biogenesis (Talanian et al., 2007;
Little et al., 2010). In the SD condition it was noted that the
FFA concentrations in the blood increased by 1.87 times, but
when the volunteers had previously trained, the increase was
lower at 1.51 times. Although these values are not statistically
different, biologically these figures suggest that HIIT was able to
increase mitochondrial biogenesis, thereby metabolizing energy

substrates more efficiently and thus reducing the increase in both
glucose and free fatty acids.
Finally, in addition to improving glucose uptake and FFA
oxidation, it was observed that 2 weeks of HIIT was efficient in
improving the performance of volunteers, corroborating other
findings that also observed decreased times in time-trial tests
(Gibala et al., 2006; Little et al., 2010). In the 4 km test, the
volunteers decreased their times by 7% in the HIIT+RS condition
and 9% in the HIIT+SD condition. In the 30 km test, the
volunteers decreased their times by 1.2% in HIIT+RS condition
and in the HIIT+RS condition by 11%. In addition to improved
performance, other studies have shown an increase in VO2max
(Whyte et al., 2010) and a decrease in body fat (Hazell et al., 2014),
which confirms the effectiveness of HIIT in promoting benefits in
a short period of time.
LIMITATIONS
It is important to consider the potential role of some parameters
that were not analyzed in this study, but which could interfere
with the glucose metabolism responses to sleep deprivation,
such as catecholamine concentrations (Trenell et al., 2007) and
melatonin (Zanuto et al., 2013).
In addition, this study has some limitations, such as the
population studied and the sample size which means that it is
not feasible to extrapolate the results to other populations, the
non-randomization of experimental conditions, and the method
by which insulin resistance (OGTT) and the non-standardization
of volunteers’ nutritional intake were evaluated.
CONCLUSION
It was concluded that HIIT prior to sleep deprivation was able to
attenuate the increase in glucose, insulin and FFA in the blood.
Therefore, this method produces significant metabolic changes
and could be considered as a non-pharmacological strategy
which is able to minimize insulin resistance imposed by sleep
deprivation.
