ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE
To investigate whether the association between 
subjective wellbeing (subjective happiness and life 
satisfaction) and cardiometabolic health is causal.
DESIGN
Two sample, bidirectional mendelian randomisation 
study.
SETTING
Genetic data taken from various cohorts comprised 
of the general population (mostly individuals of 
European ancestry, plus a small proportion of other 
ancestries); follow-up analysis included individuals 
from the United Kingdom.
PARTICIPANTS
Summary data were used from previous genome wide 
association studies (number of participants ranging 
from 83 198 to 339 224), which investigated traits 
related to cardiovascular or metabolic health, had 
the largest sample sizes, and consisted of the most 
similar populations while minimising sample overlap. 
A follow-up analysis included 337 112 individuals from 
the UK Biobank (54% female (n=181 363), mean age 
56.87 years (standard deviation 8.00) at recruitment).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Subjective wellbeing and 11 measures of 
cardiometabolic health (coronary artery disease; 
myocardial infarction; total, high density lipoprotein, 
and low density lipoprotein cholesterol; diastolic and 
systolic blood pressure; body fat; waist to hip ratio; 
waist circumference; and body mass index).
RESULTS
Evidence of a causal effect of body mass index on 
subjective wellbeing was seen; each 1 kg/m2 increase 
in body mass index caused a −0.045 (95% confidence 
interval −0.084 to −0.006, P=0.02) standard 
deviation reduction in subjective wellbeing. Follow-up 
analysis of this association in an independent sample 
from the UK Biobank provided strong evidence of an 
effect of body mass index on satisfaction with health 
(β=−0.035 unit decrease in health satisfaction (95% 
confidence interval −0.043 to −0.027) per standard 
deviation increase in body mass index, P<0.001). No 
clear evidence of a causal effect was seen between 
subjective wellbeing and the other cardiometabolic 
health measures, in either direction.
CONCLUSIONS
These results suggest that a higher body mass index 
is associated with a lower subjective wellbeing. A 
follow-up analysis confirmed this finding, suggesting 
that the effect in middle aged people could be driven 
by satisfaction with health. Body mass index is a 
modifiable determinant, and therefore, this study 
provides further motivation to tackle the obesity 
epidemic because of the knock-on effects of higher 
body mass index on subjective wellbeing.
Introduction
Subjective wellbeing is most commonly defined as 
a combination of life satisfaction and happiness 
(having high positive affect in the absence of negative 
affect).1 Life satisfaction and happiness capture both 
the cognitive and affective components of subjective 
wellbeing, respectively. The importance of wellbeing 
is emphasised by the World Health Organization 
in their definition of health,2 and observational 
evidence suggests an association between higher 
subjective wellbeing and better physical health or 
longevity,3 4 5 especially cardiovascular and metabolic 
health outcomes including cardiovascular disease,6 
cholesterol levels,7 and extremes of body mass index.8
More frequently studied, depression has been shown 
to have the opposite association with cardiometabolic 
health, increasing the risk of coronary artery disease 
(especially the chance of a heart attack),9 altering 
serum cholesterol,10 and having a U shaped relation 
with body mass index.11 A mendelian randomisation 
study of body mass index on multiple mental health 
outcomes found a consistent effect of higher body

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
Higher subjective wellbeing is associated with better physical health outcomes, 
with observational evidence highlighting effects on body mass index and 
cardiovascular health
Use of genetic data in a mendelian randomisation framework avoids reverse 
causation and residual confounding (problems associated with observational 
evidence), hence allowing stronger causal inference
A previous mendelian randomisation analysis has shown evidence of an effect of 
body mass index on subjective wellbeing, but did not adjust for sample overlap 
and did not look at other cardiometabolic traits
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
Mendelian randomisation showed strong evidence of a causal effect of higher 
body mass index on lower subjective wellbeing (β=−0.045 (95% confidence 
interval −0.084 to −0.006), P=0.02), driven by lower satisfaction with health 
(β=−0.035 (−0.043 to −0.027), P<0.001)
This study adds further support to the need to prevent obesity because of the 
downstream consequences on mental health as well as physical health
No clear evidence of a causal association between subjective wellbeing and any 
other measure of cardiometabolic health was seen in either direction, suggesting 
that previous associations might be the result of shared confounding by lifestyle 
factors

mass index on increased likelihood of depression, 
although the effect sizes were small.12 This causal 
effect was replicated in the follow-up analysis of the 
most recent genome wide association study (GWAS) of 
depression,13 and was replicated using a continuous 
measure of depressive symptoms.14 The study also 
showed suggestive evidence of a causal link between 
body mass index and subjective wellbeing using a two 
sample approach and a relaxed instrument threshold. 
However, this study did not examine cardiovascular 
health or other measures of adiposity and did not 
adjust for sample overlap, so results could be biased 
towards the confounded observational effect.15
Twin analyses suggest partly distinct genetic (and 
environmental) causes for depression and subjective 
wellbeing,16 which indicates that separate analyses 
of associations between subjective wellbeing and 
depression on health outcomes might be appropriate. 
Observational research suggests that the association 
between subjective wellbeing and cardiometabolic health 
goes beyond the absence of negative affect states, reduced 
arousal, or confounding from socioeconomic position,17 
and subjective wellbeing is more predictive of health 
outcomes than negative feelings.18 Therefore, subjective 
wellbeing might be a more effective target for improving 
cardiometabolic health outcomes than depression. From 
a public health perspective, it is important to understand 
whether increasing subjective wellbeing can increase 
health in later life, given that wellbeing interventions can 
be cost effective to administer.19
Studies suggesting a link between subjective 
wellbeing and cardiometabolic health are mostly 
observational. Owing to reverse causation and 
residual confounding, causal inferences are difficult 
to make from observational evidence.20 Mendelian 
randomisation uses genetic variants as instrumental 
variables for the exposure of interest. The inheritance 
of specific alleles is largely independent of genetic 
variants affecting other traits and of conventional 
disease risk factors, and associations are less prone 
to other biases inducing reverse causation, because 
genotype is unchanged over the lifetime.20 21 In an 
instrumental variable analysis, the genetic variant (Z) 
acts as the instrument that is related to differences 
in the exposure (X). If the exposure is on the causal 
pathway with the outcome (Y), then genetic variants 
that affect the exposure should be associated with 
the outcome (fig 1).20 For example, genetic variants 
(Z) shown to predispose individuals to have a higher 
body mass index (exposure X) are associated with 
lower income, suggesting that increases in body 
mass index reduce income (outcome Y).22 Mendelian 
randomisation is one method available to triangulate 
evidence about whether a particular intervention is 
clinically viable.23
The two sample mendelian randomisation method 
uses summary statistics from each GWAS in one 
analysis.24 Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 
reliably associated with an exposure of interest can 
essentially be looked up in the GWAS summary statistics 
of the outcome. For power, multiple genetic variants, 
rather than single genetic variants, are often used in 
two sample mendelian randomisation.15 Mendelian 
randomisation requires the genetic instrument to act 
on the outcome only via the exposure. Genetic variants 
may be pleiotropic (that is, when one genetic variant 
affects multiple phenotypes). If the SNPs chosen as 
instruments act on the outcome via a pathway other 
than through the exposure (horizontal pleiotropy), 
estimates can be biased.20 24 Use of a larger number of 
SNPs could protect against this bias if the pleiotropic 
effects balance out.15 Consistent estimates across 
multiple methods with different assumptions about 
pleiotropy also ensures that bias is less likely. Further 
information on the interpretation and assumptions of 
mendelian randomisation is presented elsewhere.23
In this study, we used mendelian randomisation 
to investigate the association between subjective 
wellbeing and the cardiometabolic health traits of body 
mass index, waist to hip ratio, waist circumference, body 
fat, coronary artery disease, high density lipoprotein 
cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, total 
cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood 
pressure, and myocardial infarction. We conducted 
two sample bidirectional analyses to establish whether 
subjective wellbeing affects cardiometabolic health 
traits, or vice versa. We extended previous research 
by conducting follow-up analysis in an independent 
sample to avoid sample overlap, adding novel 
mendelian randomisation methods and examining 
the causal relation between subjective wellbeing and 
various cardiometabolic health measures.
Methods 
Our mendelian randomisation analysis consisted 
of two parts: two sample mendelian randomisation 
using GWAS summary data, and a follow-up analysis 
exploring results with sample overlap.

measured using any items relating to happiness or 
positive affect and overall life satisfaction. GWAS 
of each component were meta-analysed to capture 
subjective wellbeing.25 For further information on the 
phenotype definitions and GWAS methods for all traits, 
see supplementary table S2. All phenotype scores were 
z scored apart from blood pressure.31
Statistical analyses
We applied four complementary methods of two 
sample mendelian randomisation (inverse variance 
weighted method, mendelian randomisation-Egger 
(MR-Egger) method, weighted median method, and 
weighted mode based estimation), which make 
different assumptions about horizontal pleiotropy. A 
consistent effect across the four methods is less likely 
to be a false positive.33 If the genetic variants have 
horizontally pleiotropic effects but are independent of 
the effects of the genetic variants on the exposure, this 
is known as balanced pleiotropy. If all the pleiotropic 
effects are biasing the estimate in the same direction 
(directional pleiotropy), this will bias the results (with 
the exception of the MR-Egger method). We used the 
MR-Egger intercept and MR-PRESSO (mendelian 
randomisation pleiotropy residual sum and outlier) to 
test for the presence of directional pleiotropy. Analyses 
were conducted using MR-Base,34 a package for two 
sample mendelian randomisation.
Instrument identification—For all phenotypes, apart 
from subjective wellbeing, our genetic instruments 
were composed of genome wide significant SNPs 
(P<5×10−8) from published GWAS studies. Only three 
genome wide significant SNPs were available for 
subjective wellbeing. We tested the strength of these 
instruments by checking whether they predicted 
happiness in a large independent sample (n=242 219) 
from the UK Biobank. There was evidence that only 
one SNP (rs2075677) was associated with happiness 
(supplementary table S3). Therefore, we used a more 
liberal P value threshold of P<5×10−5 as the instrument 
for subjective wellbeing. We selected independent 
SNPs (linkage disequilibrium (LD) R2=0.001, >10 000 
kb) using the “clump_data” function on MR-Base. If an 
SNP was unavailable in the outcome GWAS summary 
statistics, then proxy SNPs were searched for with a 
minimum LD R2=0.8. If a SNP was palindromic, we 
aligned strands using minor allele frequency up to 0.3, 
after which 84 SNPs remained associated at P<5×10−5. 
This genetic instrument was checked for overlap with 
depression13 to ensure that the significant SNPs were 
unique to the subjective wellbeing GWAS. None of the 
84 SNPs was associated with major depressive disorder 
at the genome wide level of significance, suggesting 
that, based on the current GWAS data, the instruments 
were independent (supplementary table S4). Power 
calculations are presented in supplementary table S5.
Inverse variance weighted method—We obtained the 
inverse variance weighted estimate by meta-analysing 
the SNP specific Wald estimates using multiplicative 
random effects. The random effects model was chosen 
to account for heterogeneity, also measured by 
Cochran’s Q. The Wald estimate is the SNP outcome 
regression divided by the SNP exposure regression. 
This method assumes balanced pleiotropy.35 36
MR-Egger 
method—This 
method 
relaxes 
the 
assumptions of mendelian randomisation and allows 
for directional pleiotropic effects, such that some SNPs 
could be acting on the outcome through a pathway 
other than through the exposure. The intercept is not 
constrained to pass through zero and provides an 
estimate of the directional pleiotropic effect.36 MR-
Egger has the lowest power of the four methods to detect 
a causal effect. It requires variation in the SNP effects, 
and therefore is most effective when more SNPs are 
used to create the instrument. MR-Egger is based on the 
INSIDE assumption (instrument strength independent 
of the direct effects). It requires that the SNPs’ 
pleiotropic effects on the outcome are independent of 
the SNPs’ association with the exposure.36 The MR-
Egger method is also based on the NOME assumption

similar sex ratios and ancestries included. The largest difference was between the consortiums for coronary artery disease and subjective wellbeing, which 
used 77% and 100% individuals of European ancestry, respectively. If two populations differ, two sample mendelian randomisation can still be used to 
test for a causal effect, but the magnitude of the effect might not be as precise.32

which is evaluated by the regression dilution I2
(GX) 
statistic.37 If the statistic was lower than 0.9, simulation 
extrapolation corrections were performed37 (see 
supplementary table S7 for further information).
Weighted median method—This approach assumes 
that at least 50% of the total weight of the instrument 
comes from valid variants. It is more likely to give a 
valid causal estimate than MR-Egger or the inverse 
variance weighted method because it is more consistent 
with the true causal effect in the presence of up to 50% 
invalid variants.32
Weighted mode based estimation—This method 
assumes that the most common causal effect is 
consistent with the true causal effect.38 Hence, the 
remaining instruments could be invalid (that is, violate 
the assumptions of mendelian randomisation) without 
biasing the estimated causal effect.
MR-PRESSO—This test identifies possible bias from 
horizontal pleiotropy.39 The test consists of three parts: 
the MR-PRESSO global test, which detects horizontal 
pleiotropy; the outlier corrected causal estimate, which 
corrects for the detected horizontal pleiotropy; and the 
MR-PRESSO distortion test, which estimates whether 
the causal estimate is significantly different (at P<0.05) 
after adjustment for outliers.39 We conducted all three 
stages and present the outlier adjusted causal estimates 
when both global and distortion tests were significant.
Follow-up analysis in the UK Biobank
We followed up our results from the two sample 
mendelian randomisation (to overcome potential bias 
from sample overlap) using a mendelian randomisation 
analysis where participants for the exposure and 
outcome were from the same sample (UK Biobank), 
with a weighted genetic score calculated by use of 
estimates from GWAS data. The follow-up sample and 
measures are described below.
Study sample
UK Biobank is a national health resource in the 
United Kingdom with biological measures collected 
over 10 years (www.ukbiobank.ac.uk). A total of 
502 647 participants aged 39-72 years were recruited 
from across the UK between 2006 and 2010.40 After 
restricting to European ancestry and excluding related 
individuals, withdrawn consent, and sex mismatched 
individuals, the study included 337 112 participants.41 
Of these individuals, the mean age was 56.87 years 
(standard deviation 8.00) at recruitment, and 54% 
(n=181 363) were female.
A subsample of participants (n=150 000) were 
genotyped first, and this sample was selected on 
the basis of smoking status, to include more current 
smokers than would be representative of the UK 
population.42 These 150 000 genotyped individuals 
also contributed measures of happiness to the Social 
Science Genetics Association Consortium (SSGAC) of 
subjective wellbeing.25 The remaining UK Biobank 
participants have since been genotyped. To avoid any 
possible biases associated with smoking, we used 
the full UK Biobank sample in the follow-up analysis 
presented here (n=337 112). However, because of 
partial sample overlap with the SSGAC group, we 
repeated the same follow-up analysis including only 
individuals who did not contribute to the consortium 
(n=242 219).
Body mass index allele score and observed body 
mass index
To further test the association between body mass 
index and wellbeing, we constructed a polygenic score 
for body mass index in UK Biobank. This polygenic 
score was constructed by extracting the 97 variants 
found to be associated at genome wide significance 
with body mass index in an independent GWAS26 (see 
supplementary table S6 for full SNP list). Allele scores 
for each SNP were calculated as a sum of the number of 
increasing alleles weighted by the effect sizes from the 
GWAS summary statistics. Therefore, higher polygenic 
scores indicated an increased risk of higher body mass 
index. The allele score was standardised to mean 
zero and standard deviation one. The F statistic was 
calculated to assess instrument strength in the sample. 
Observed body mass index was calculated (weight (kg) 
divided by height (m) squared) from measurements of 
height and weight taken during the initial assessment 
centre visit.
Outcomes and confounders
We used phenotypic measurements collected at initial 
assessment (in 2006-10). The measures included 
subjective happiness, life satisfaction, and baseline 
demographics. Subjective happiness was assessed 
by a single item questionnaire measure. Responses 
to the question “In general, how happy are you?” 
were collected on a 6 point Likert scale, ranging 
from “Extremely unhappy” to “Extremely happy.” 
Individuals who responded with “Do not know” or 
“Prefer not to answer” were coded as missing.
Life satisfaction was assessed by five single item 
measures relating to domains of life satisfaction. 
Domains were: family and relationships, work or job, 
health, finances, and friendships (eg, “In general, how 
satisfied are you with your family relationships?”). 
Responses were collected on a 6 point Likert scale 
ranging from “Extremely unhappy” to “Extremely 
happy.” Individuals who responded with “Do not know” 
or “Prefer not to answer” (as well as “I am not employed” 
for the work/job domain) were coded as missing.
Baseline demographic measures were collected 
at initial assessment, including sex, age, and 
socioeconomic 
position. 
Socioeconomic 
position 
was measured by the Townsend deprivation index 
(Townsend, 1987) on the basis of participants’ 
location in the UK (calculated from output area) and 
information from the most recent national census.

regressions run in R,43 using the ivreg command from 
the AER package. We attempted to replicate the effect 
of body mass index on subjective wellbeing using the 
body mass index polygenic score as the instrument. 
Age, sex, and 10 principal components of population 
structure were controlled for in all instrumental 
variable regression analyses.
Patient and public involvement
The current research was not informed by patient 
and public involvement because it used secondary 
data. However, future research following on from 
our findings should be guided by patient and public 
opinions.
Results
Two sample mendelian randomisation
Subjective wellbeing predicting cardiometabolic 
health outcomes
There was no clear evidence to suggest a causal effect 
of subjective wellbeing on any of the cardiometabolic 
health outcomes (fig 2). A more stringent analysis using 
only genome wide significant SNPs as the instrument 
produced a similar pattern of results (supplementary 
figure S1). Phenotype scores were standardised for all 
outcomes except blood pressure, which is represented 
on a different scale.
Cardiometabolic health predicting subjective 
wellbeing
We found evidence that higher body mass index caused 
lower subjective wellbeing (fig 3). The direction of 
effect remained consistent across all four methods. 
There was no clear evidence of a causal effect of any of 
the cardiovascular health or adiposity exposures on 
subjective wellbeing (fig 3). Genome wide significant 
SNPs (P<5×10−8) for each cardiometabolic health measure 
were used as genetic instruments, and the number of 
SNPs given for each analysis is shown in figure 3.
Cochran’s Q and I2 statistics were calculated to check 
for the presence of heterogeneity (dispersion of SNP 
effects), which can indicate pleiotropy. We found little 
evidence of heterogeneity for the association between 
body mass index and wellbeing (see supplementary 
table S8 for results and further information). The MR-
Egger intercept suggested little evidence of directional 
pleiotropy (supplementary table S9, all P>0.07). 
The funnel plot of individual SNP effects showed 
a symmetrical distribution of SNP effects around 
the effect estimate, suggesting balanced pleiotropy 
(supplementary figure S2). We also conducted a leave-
one-out analysis, which showed that the SNP with the 
largest contribution to the effect is rs1421085 located on 
chromosome 16 in the second intron of the FTO (fat mass 
and obesity associated) gene (supplementary figure S3).
Follow-up analysis in the UK Biobank
Mean body mass index in the UK Biobank follow-up 
sample was 27.39 (standard deviation 4.75). Means 
and standard deviations for the subjective wellbeing 
measures are given in supplementary table S10, along 
with observational associations between body mass 
index and subjective wellbeing in the UK Biobank 
sample.
Association with baseline confounders
The association of the body mass index genetic score and 
observed body mass index with baseline confounders 
(age, 
sex, 
socioeconomic 
position, 
education, 
smoking, and alcohol consumption) were compared 
(supplementary figure S4). We found evidence of an 
association between our body mass index genetic score 
and socioeconomic position, educational attainment, 
smoking behaviour, and alcohol consumption. For 
educational attainment and socioeconomic position, 
the association was weaker for the genetic score than 
for the observed body mass index.
Association between polygenic score and body mass 
index
The genetic score was strongly associated with 
observed body mass index (strength of instrument F(1, 
336027)=6237, R2=0.018, P<0.001).
Follow-up analysis of body mass index (exposure) on 
subjective wellbeing (outcome)
We found strong evidence of a causal effect of body 
mass index (per 1 kg/m2) on satisfaction with health 
(β=−0.035, 95% confidence interval −0.043 to 
−0.027, P<0.001; fig 4), which is consistent with 
previous estimates from an automated hypothesis free 
MR-PheWAS (which took the polygenic score for body 
mass index and looked at the association with every 
outcome in the UK Biobank).44 We saw little evidence 
of a causal effect of body mass index on any of the 
other measures of subjective wellbeing, and little 
evidence that this effect differed in older and younger 
participants (although the age range in UK Biobank is 
narrow, with all participants over 40 years old). When 
individuals were split by median age, the evidence 
for a causal effect of body mass index on satisfaction 
with health remained strong in both age groups (age 
≤58 years, −0.040 (95% confidence interval −0.051 
to −0.029), P<0.001; age >58 years, −0.028 (−0.040 
to −0.016), P<0.001). When individuals were split 
by sex, the evidence for a causal effect of body mass 
index on satisfaction with health remained strong 
for both sexes (women, −0.034 (−0.044 to −0.024), 
P<0.001; men, −0.035 (−0.048 to −0.023), P<0.001). 
The results remained the same in the independent 
sample after removal of the contributors to the 
SSGAC consortium (the subjective wellbeing GWAS; 
supplementary table S11).
Discussion 
Evidence for higher body mass index reducing 
subjective wellbeing
In the present study, we have found evidence indicating 
that higher body mass index has a causal relation with 
lower subjective wellbeing, consistent with previous 
mendelian 
randomisation 
findings.14

directional pleiotropy, and the finding was replicated 
in the UK Biobank cohort. The follow-up analysis 
suggested that the causal effect of body mass index on 
subjective wellbeing was driven by satisfaction with 
health, such that higher body mass index caused lower 
health satisfaction.

satisfaction could be biological or social. Biological

cardiovascular illness, and cancers,45 with randomised

trials 
and

randomisation 
strengthening evidence of a causal effect.46 47 48 
Therefore, the effect of body mass index on satisfaction 
with health seen in the current study could reflect 
accurate perceptions of health. Alternatively, societal 
influences could cause individuals to associate 
negative health consequences with a higher body 
mass index and consequently report lower health 
satisfaction. Subjective wellbeing and health are in a 
complex and dynamic system of causal pathways, and 
further work is needed to understand these pathways 
using mediation analysis.3
Improved subjective wellbeing as an outcome of 
reducing body mass index might serve as a motivator 
for behaviour change. Despite knowing the physical 
health consequences of having a high body mass index, 
obese individuals often struggle to maintain diets 
and lose weight.49 Individuals value happiness very 
highly1; therefore, emphasis of the potential benefits 
of weight loss to improve subjective wellbeing could 
be an unexplored motivator for encouraging weight 
reduction. Further work should explore the clinical use 
of subjective wellbeing as a desirable outcome.
In understanding this causal effect further, another 
important consideration might be the influence of 
age. Individuals recruited for the UK Biobank were 
middle aged or older, with an average age of 57 years. 
Body mass index could be an important determinant 
of health satisfaction in an older generation as the 
health implications of obesity (heart disease, diabetes, 
cancer) begin to emerge.50 In younger age groups, body 
dissatisfaction, self esteem, and bullying might be 
more important mediators of the association between 
body mass index and wellbeing.51 Further investigation 
of the causal pathways in a younger sample should be 
explored, especially as some genetic variants for body 
mass index show a developmentally specific pattern of 
association.52 53
Despite causal effects of body mass index seen on 
subjective wellbeing, there was no causal effect of 
waist to hip ratio, waist circumference, or body fat 
percentage. Body mass index is used as a proxy for 
adiposity because it is widely available, easy to collect 
in large samples, and other more precise measures of 
adiposity have not been shown to differ substantially 
in observational studies.14 All confidence intervals 
for these precise adiposity measures and body mass 
index overlap; therefore, we cannot rule out a small 
effect of these phenotypes on subjective wellbeing. 
Additionally, we might not have seen a clear effect of 
body fat percentage on subjective wellbeing because 
the instrument for body fat percentage was relatively 
weak, using only nine SNPs identified in a GWAS 
with a relatively small sample size. Furthermore, 
there are differences in waist to hip ratio and waist 
circumference between the sexes that we were unable 
to explore because the GWAS for subjective wellbeing 
was in a mixed sex sample. Sex differences could 
have been masking underlying effects of these more 
precise adiposity measures on subjective wellbeing. 
Body mass index can also vary for reasons other 
than adiposity. Future research should therefore 
explore which aspect of body mass index is driving 
the identified effect on subjective wellbeing, because 
a clear understanding of the mechanisms is important 
for designing interventions.15
Observational evidence suggests a non-linear 
association between mental health and body mass 
index, where extremely high and low body mass 
index both predict lower rates of wellbeing.8 11 The 
association between very low body mass index and 
depression seen in observational studies could be 
driven by eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa. 
The two disorders are commonly comorbid, with a 50% 
lifetime prevalence of major depression in individuals 
with anorexia.54 Twin studies have suggested that 
this comorbidity is due to shared genetic influence 
between anorexia and major depressive disorder.55 
However, our mendelian randomisation estimators 
assumed a linear relation. Therefore, if individuals 
with low body mass index also have lower subjective 
wellbeing, this could lead to the effect observed in 
mendelian randomisation being smaller than it truly 
is. New methods to allow for non-linear associations 
in mendelian randomisation are being developed,56 57 
but are currently too underpowered to apply here.
Evidence for subjective wellbeing influencing health 
outcomes
In our study, the two sample mendelian randomisation 
analyses showed no clear evidence of a causal effect 
of subjective wellbeing on cardiometabolic health 
outcomes. This result is consistent with a prospective 
analysis in over 700 000 women, which found no effect 
of happiness on later mortality, if baseline health was 
controlled for.58 Previous observational associations34 
could be due to residual confounding, reverse 
causation, or publication bias.59 60 In our analysis, 
we saw little evidence that subjective wellbeing had 
a causal effect on cardiometabolic health outcomes. 
The genetic variants for subjective wellbeing have 
small effect sizes, accounting for about 0.01% of the 
variance, and confidence intervals were wide. Weak 
instrument bias in mendelian randomisation biases 
towards the null,61 which could explain the lack of 
evidence for a causal effect of subjective wellbeing. 
Owing to the direction of bias, false positive effects will 
not be induced by weak instruments (as could be the

case in traditional instrumental variable analysis61). 
Further analysis is needed when stronger instruments 
are available.
Evidence for cardiovascular health influencing 
subjective wellbeing
We saw no clear evidence for a causal effect of 
cholesterol, coronary artery disease risk, blood 
pressure, or myocardial infarction risk on subjective 
wellbeing, meaning that residual confounding is 
likely to be responsible for the previous observational 
associations. This conclusion is supported by recent 
evidence from a new approach called Bayesian direct 
multimorbidity mapping. This approach found that 
coronary artery disease was only associated with 
depression because of an association with body 
mass index.62 However, coronary artery disease and 
myocardial infarction are rare outcomes, and the SNPs 
for coronary artery disease risk used in our analysis 
all had small effect sizes,30 resulting in limited power 
to detect an effect on subjective wellbeing. However, 
the continuous phenotype of blood pressure still 
showed no causal effects on subjective wellbeing, 
further supporting residual confounding. Overall, the 
evidence suggests no causal effect of cardiovascular 
health on subjective wellbeing.
General limitations of the study
In addition to the specific limitations of weak 
instruments and statistical power outlined above, 
a more general limitation of this study could be the 
influence of population structure on the genetic 
instrument. In large samples such as the UK Biobank 
cohort, it is difficult to fully remove population 
structure without removing true effects.63 Coincident 
structure could confound the association between 
body mass index and subjective wellbeing, generating 
spurious signal. Although we cannot completely 
remove the possible influence of structure in our follow-
up analysis, we are reasonably confident that the effect 
of body mass index on satisfaction with health is not 
spurious because we do not see the same inflation for 
the negative control outcomes of domain satisfaction 
or happiness. Furthermore, non-genetic instrumental 
variables give the same results as genetic instruments 
in the UK Biobank for educational attainment, a trait 
largely influenced by structure.64
Secondly, the follow-up analysis showed evidence of 
an association between the body mass index polygenic 
score and baseline confounders. If the body mass 
index SNPs affect these confounders independently 
(horizontal pleiotropy), then the assumptions of 
mendelian randomisation are violated, and bias would 
be introduced. Alternatively, alcohol consumption 
and smoking could be on the causal pathway from 
body mass index to wellbeing (vertical pleiotropy), 
which does not violate the assumptions of mendelian 
randomisation.65 66 67 Given the complexity of these 
genetic and phenotypic relations, it is difficult to 
disentangle 
horizontal 
and 
vertical 
pleiotropy; 
however, we can be reasonably confident that our 
results are due to vertical pleiotropy, because the MR-
Egger intercept did not show evidence of horizontal 
pleiotropy and MR-PRESSO gave a consistent result 
after removal of pleiotropic outliers.
Conclusion
Using mendelian randomisation, we found no clear 
evidence for a causal effect of cardiovascular health 
on subjective wellbeing, or of subjective wellbeing on 
cardiometabolic health. This lack of evidence suggests 
that previously reported observational associations 
could have resulted from residual confounding. We 
found strong evidence for a causal effect of increased 
body mass index on decreased subjective wellbeing. 
Follow-up analysis in UK Biobank suggested that the 
effect of body mass index on subjective wellbeing was 
driven by an adverse effect of higher body mass index on 
health satisfaction. Our findings add further support to 
the need to reduce obesity because of the downstream 
consequences on mental health and wellbeing. Further 
work is needed to understand the pathways from body 
mass index to subjective wellbeing and to explore how 
the effect of body mass index on mental health varies 
at different ages.
