SUMMARY
Place cell firing patterns reactivated during hippo-
campal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) in rest or sleep
are thought to induce synaptic plasticity and thereby
promote the consolidation of recently encoded infor-
mation. However, the capacity of reactivated spike
trains to induce plasticity has not been directly
tested. Here, we show that reactivated place cell
firing patterns simultaneously recorded from CA3
and CA1 of rat dorsal hippocampus are able to
induce long-term potentiation (LTP) at synapses be-
tween CA3 and CA1 cells but only if accompanied by
SWR-associated synaptic activity and resulting den-
dritic depolarization. In addition, we show that the
precise timing of coincident CA3 and CA1 place cell
spikes in relation to SWR onset is critical for the in-
duction of LTP and predictive of plasticity generated
by reactivation. Our findings confirm an important
role for SWRs in triggering and tuning plasticity pro-
cesses that underlie memory consolidation in the
hippocampus during rest or sleep.
INTRODUCTION
Synaptic plasticity is believed to mediate the encoding of mem-
ories by strengthening connectivity between co-active neurons
representing constituent features of an event or environment
(Hebb, 1949; Bliss and Collingridge, 1993). Recently encoded
memories are liable to interference and require consolidation, a
process thought to occur during rest and sleep when recently
active neural ensembles are reactivated in the hippocampus
(Pavlides and Winson, 1989; Wilson and McNaughton, 1994;
Skaggs et al., 1996; Louie and Wilson, 2001; Lee and Wilson,
2002; Foster and Wilson, 2006; Diba and Buzsa
´ ki, 2007). During
these consolidation epochs, existing hippocampal connectivity
may be refined through further plasticity and consolidated en-
grams subsequently integrated into neocortex for longer-term
storage (Frankland and Bontempi, 2005). This two-step model
of memory formation therefore requires that long-term potentia-
tion (LTP) is induced during both the encoding and consolidation
stages (Buzsa
´ ki, 1989).
LTP can be induced at hippocampal synapses by intense,
high-frequency stimulation of presynaptic axons, postsynaptic
depolarization coupled with presynaptic stimulation (Bliss and
Collingridge, 1993), or by delivering tightly synchronized pre-
and postsynaptic activity (Magee and Johnston, 1997; Bi and
Poo, 1998; Debanne et al., 1998; Buchanan and Mellor, 2010).
The latter, also referred to as spike-timing-dependent plasticity
(STDP), leads to LTP or long-term depression (LTD) according
to the precise timing and temporal order of pre- and postsyn-
aptic activity. Spike-timing-dependent LTP (STD-LTP) requires
causal spiking to occur within a narrow temporal window, with
a presynaptic spike followed by a postsynaptic spike within
30 ms. Anti-causal activity, whereby the postsynaptic neuron
fires before the presynaptic neuron, can lead to STD-LTD. How-
ever, STDP rules are synapse- and developmental-stage-spe-
cific. For example, at mature Schaffer collateral (SC)-CA1 synap-
ses, multiple postsynaptic spikes are required for STD-LTP (Pike
et al., 1999; Buchanan and Mellor, 2007); this is important when
considering the spiking requirements for STDP between co-
active neurons encoding a given memory. In vivo, tightly corre-
lated CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cell spiking is predicted to satisfy
the requirements for STDP induction at SC-CA-1 synapses
(O’Neill et al., 2010). Indeed, there are defined periods during
the encoding and consolidation phases of hippocampal memory
processing when CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells are coactive and
STDP may occur (Isaac et al., 2009; Bush et al., 2010a; Carr
et al., 2011; Sadowski et al., 2011).
Hippocampal place cells fire in a location-dependent manner
(O’Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971), and thousands of cells in the
hippocampal CA3-CA1 network are likely to have overlapping
place fields, and therefore be co-activated, within a given envi-
ronment (Muller et al., 1987). The firing patterns of cells with
overlapping place fields may satisfy the requirements for
STDP to be induced during memory encoding, for example on
exploration of a novel environment (Muller et al., 1996). In fact,
these firing patterns have been shown to induce LTP at SC-
CA1 synapses in vitro, but only when cholinergic receptors
are also activated in a manner that may mimic the elevated
cholinergic tone observed during awake behavior (Isaac et al.,
2009). This is consistent with previous evidence for induction

 of LTP during encoding of memories (Morris et al., 1986; Whit-
lock et al., 2006).
The reactivation or replay of place cell firing patterns during
rest or sleep is associated with transient, high-frequency
network oscillations known as sharp-wave ripples (SWRs),
which are necessary for normal memory consolidation (Girar-
deau et al., 2009; Ego-Stengel and Wilson, 2010; Jadhav et al.,
2012). Reactivated place cell firing patterns during SWRs un-
dergo time compression by a factor of �10 when measured
across all place cells on a track (Lee and Wilson, 2002), leading
to synchronous CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cell firing that is pre-
dicted to engage STDP. Therefore, despite reduced levels of
cholinergic tone in the hippocampus during rest and sleep, the
reactivation of place cell firing patterns during SWRs may sup-
port plasticity and memory consolidation in the hippocampus
(O’Neill et al., 2010). However, current evidence for LTP induc-
tion during memory consolidation falls short of demonstrating
that replayed spike patterns induce plasticity; bicuculline-
induced bursting in CA3 can induce LTP at SC inputs to CA1
in vitro (Buzsa
´ ki et al., 1987), and stimulating CA1 pyramidal cells
during spontaneous SWR can increase subsequent postsyn-
aptic responsivity in vivo (King et al., 1999). Meanwhile, an alter-
native hypothesis suggests that LTP during sleep could be coun-
terproductive and proposes that synaptic renormalization during
sleep may be vital for learning and memory (Grosmark et al.,
2012; Tononi and Cirelli, 2014).
Here, we directly test the prediction that reactivated place cell
firing patterns induce LTP. We used natural pre- and postsyn-
aptic spike and local field potential (LFP) patterns simultaneously
recorded from CA3 and CA1, respectively, during consolidation
epochs in vivo to control synaptic inputs and postsynaptic
spiking in CA1 pyramidal cells recorded in vitro. We find that re-
activation of place cell firing patterns during SWRs can induce
LTP and demonstrate how spike timing in relation to ongoing
network activity modulates plasticity.
RESULTS
To address whether synaptic plasticity is induced during reacti-
vation of memory traces, we first sampled CA3 and CA1 place
cell firing patterns recorded from adult male Wistar rats in vivo
during exploration and rest periods (Figure 1A). Unit and LFP ac-
tivity was recorded while rats explored a familiar linear track for
10 min and were then transferred into a rest box for a 15-min
period of quiescence (Figure 1B). Subsequently, a selection of
spike trains recorded from CA3 and CA1 place cells during
the rest box period on a single day were used to stimulate acute
hippocampal slices prepared from naive, non-implanted rats
(Figure 1C).
Recording Place Cell Reactivation
To test the plasticity potential of reactivated place cell firing pat-
terns, a subset of five place cells, four from CA1 and one from
CA3, recorded in one animal during the first 5 min of the rest
box period were selected (Figures 1D–1F). These cells all satis-
fied criteria identifying them as putative excitatory pyramidal
neurons and were selected because they showed clearly defined
place fields that were evenly distributed along the length of the
track (Figures 1D and 1E). Upon transfer to the rest box, these
cells showed typical activity during SWRs, when multiple cells
were active within individual SWR time windows (Figure 1F).
The median number of spikes per SWR fired by CA3 neurons
was 0.22 (first and third quartiles 0.03 and 1.0, respectively);
the representative CA3 neuron used for in vitro experiments
(CA3a in Figure 1) fired an average of 0.45 spikes per SWR. In
CA1, neurons fired a median of 0.28 spikes per SWR (first and
third quartiles 0.06 and 1.3), with the four exemplars firing aver-
ages of 1.42, 0.75, 0.34, and 0.44 spikes per SWR (CA1b–CA1e
in Figure 1). The temporal structure of these SWR-associated
spiking
events
commonly
reflected
the
firing
sequences
observed on the track (Figures 1G and 1H), consistent with re-
ports of remote replay of recent behavioral sequences (Karlsson
and Frank, 2009), which is proposed to be important for the
consolidation of memory.
Induction of LTP by Reactivation Events
To assess the plasticity potential of these SWR-associated reac-
tivation events, we turned to the in vitro hippocampal slice prep-
aration, where the strength of synaptic connections between in-
dividual place cells (i.e., CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells) may be
accurately measured. We tested whether the activity of the five
place cells recorded during the resting or quiescent phase

 were capable of inducing plasticity had they been synaptically
coupled (though we made no assumption that these particular
place cells were directly interconnected in vivo). Given the esti-
mated numbers of place cells active in any one environment
and the likely numbers engaged in reactivation (Muller et al.,
1987; O’Neill et al., 2008), coupled with the dense connectivity
between CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells (Li et al., 1994), it is not
unreasonable to assume that place cells with similar activity pro-
files to those we have recorded will be synaptically coupled
in vivo (Isaac et al., 2009).
We made whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from CA1 pyra-
midal cells in acute hippocampal slices. To replicate the activity
seen by synapses in vivo during reactivation events, we stimu-
lated these CA1 cells and their SC inputs with patterns of activity
recorded from CA1 and CA3 place cells, respectively, during the
initial 5 min of the post-run rest period (Figure 2A), as this epoch
contained the largest concentration of SWR-associated reacti-
vation events. Timestamps marking when each cell fired during
this time period were used to create four induction protocols.
In each case, the CA3 spike train provided the presynaptic input
and each of the four CA1 cell spike trains provided a different
pattern of postsynaptic activity. Synaptic strength at two inde-
pendent SC-CA1 pathways (control and test) was monitored
before and after one of the induction protocols was delivered
to the test pathway. Replication of in vivo reactivation events
was achieved by electrically stimulating a small number of SC
axons at CA3 cell spike times to evoke subthreshold excitatory
postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs; corresponding to an average
baseline excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) amplitude of
33.9 ± 5.8 pA for test pathways and 35.1 ± 6.0 pA for control
pathways), while action potentials were evoked in the postsyn-
aptic CA1 cell by a brief somatic current injection from the patch
pipette at CA1 spike times (Figure 2B). Transient increases in
membrane potential caused by phasic excitation that have
been observed during SWRs in CA1 pyramidal cells (Maier
et al., 2011) were also modeled in the slice preparation; a third
independent SC input pathway in stratum radiatum was stimu-
lated with five pulses at 100 Hz at timestamps when SWRs
had been detected in the LFP (57 detected in 300 s). The stimu-
lation intensity of this pathway was tuned to match the depolar-
ization envelope duration and amplitude observed in vivo (Fig-
ure 2C) through synaptic activation of CA1 dendrites (Maier
et al., 2011).
Replication of the CA3a-CA1b spike train combination
induced test pathway-specific LTP (Figures 2D and 2E; test
path, 2.19 ± 0.47; control path, 1.15 ± 0.22; test versus control
pathway p < 0.05, n = 8). These two spike trains were cross-
correlated during SWR-associated activity in a 200 ms time win-
dow, where peak firing of the CA1b during SWRs occurred
0–10 ms before CA3a (Figure 2F). The CA3a-CA1c combination
also induced LTP (Figure 2G; test path, 2.42 ± 0.79; control path,
1.01 ± 0.12; test versus control pathway p < 0.05, n = 8). Like
CA1b, CA1c firing was tightly correlated with CA3a during
SWRs within a 200-ms time window, with the CA1 cell most often
firing before the CA3 cell (Figure 2H). The largest change in syn-
aptic strength occurred following stimulation with the CA3a-
CA1d combination (Figure 2I; test path, 3.36 ± 0.73; control
path, 1.28 ± 0.19; test versus control pathway p < 0.05, n = 8).
The cross-correlated firing of CA1d and CA3a during SWRs
showed greater numbers of events where the CA3 cell fired
before the CA1 cell (Figure 2J). The combination of CA3a-
CA1e was the only one not to induce LTP despite having the
highest number of spikes occurring during SWRs (Figure 2K;
test path, 0.97 ± 0.16; control path, 1.27 ± 0. 43; test versus con-
trol pathway p > 0.05, n = 9). The spiking of CA1e and CA3a
was not tightly correlated during SWRs with few CA1 spikes
occurring within 30 ms of CA3 spikes (Figure 2L). In all cases,
LTP developed slowly, lacking a short-term facilitatory compo-
nent similar to that previously described for low-frequency
STDP in hippocampal slices (Pike et al., 1999; Isaac et al.,
2009; Kwag and Paulsen, 2009).
Importance of SWR-Associated Depolarization for
Reactivation-Induced LTP
To test the importance of subthreshold depolarizations during
SWRs, we repeated these experiments in the absence of

Naive Slices
(A) Schematic of in vitro recording setup. A CA1 pyramidal cell was patched and bipolar stimulating electrodes were positioned in the stratum radiatum to provide
three independent stimulation pathways (Figure S1). The test pathway simulated the input of a CA3 pyramidal cell to CA1. The ripple pathway was used to
simulate transient membrane potential depolarization caused by phasic excitatory input experienced by CA1 pyramidal cells during SWRs.
(B) Method of stimulating slices with CA3 and CA1 cell spike patterns. The induction protocol was recorded in the current clamp configuration. Somatic current
injections induced action potentials at CA1 cell time stamps. Electrical stimulation of Schaffer collaterals (SCs) elicited subthreshold EPSPs at CA3 cell time-
stamps.
(C) SWR-associated synaptic input was achieved using a five-pulse stimulus train (100 Hz) delivered to the ripple pathway at detected SWR onset times.
(D) An example experiment. Test pathway, black circles; control pathway, open circles. Baseline SC stimulation was tuned to elicit subthreshold EPSPs soon after
break-in. Baseline EPSCs were recorded every 5 s on the control and test pathway for 5 min in voltage clamp (�70 mV). Spike pattern CA3a-CA1b was delivered
between 5 and 10 min in current-clamp configuration. EPSC amplitudes in test and control pathways were recorded for a further 30 min after spike pattern
delivery.
(E, G, I, and K) CA3a and CA1b (E), CA3a-CA1c (G), and CA3a-CA1d (I) spike combinations induced pathway-specific LTP, whereas CA3a-CA1e (K) did not.

0.28; test versus control pathway p >
0.05, n = 7).
These data suggest that depolarization
associated with SWRs is required to
induce LTP using spike patterns recorded
during rest. However, it is not clear
if depolarization originating from synaptic
stimulation is required or whether somatic
depolarization is sufficient. To test this,
we injected an artificial sine wave current
at the soma to replicate the transient
membrane potential deflections observed
during SWRs in vivo (Figure 3E). This
method of simulating SWR associated
changes in somatic membrane potential
failed to facilitate LTP for the CA3a-
CA1b spike train combination in the
same way as synaptic stimulation (Fig-
ure 3F; test path, 1.42 ± 0.40; control path, 1.24 ± 0.27; test
versus control pathway p > 0.05, n = 7). Similarly, constant depo-
larization of the somatic membrane potential to �60 mV during
presentation of the CA3a-CA1b spike train failed to facilitate
LTP (Figure 3G; test path, 1.03 ± 0.20; control path, 1.29 ±
0.38; test versus control pathway p > 0.05, n = 9). These results
indicate that dendritic rather than somatic depolarization during
SWRs is the critical factor for LTP induction (Williams and
Mitchell, 2008).

 Importance of Spike Timing during SWRs for
Reactivation-Induced LTP
As well as the location of SWR-associated depolarization, the
timing of SWR-associated depolarization is also likely to impact
the induction of synaptic plasticity. To test this, we artificially
de-coupled the timing of the reactivated spike patterns and the
simulated SWR-associated synaptic stimulation.
The in vivo data showed that at time points when SWR onsets
were detected in the LFP, an increase in the spiking of all five
cells used in the spike pattern stimulation experiments was
observed (Figure 4A). Offsetting SWRs by shifting them 100 ms
earlier relative to the spike times reduced the correlation be-
tween spikes and SWRs (King et al., 1999; Ego-Stengel and Wil-
son, 2010; Jadhav et al., 2012) (Figure 4A). When slices were
stimulated with the same spike trains as in Figure 3 but with
SWR-associated synaptic stimulation triggered 100 ms early
(Figure 4B), LTP was significantly attenuated or not induced at
all. Pathway-specific LTP was induced following stimulation
with CA3a-CA1b and offset SWRs (Figure 4C; test path, 1.61 ±
0.24; control path, 1.13 ± 0.15; test versus control pathway p <

CA3-CA1 spiking increases immediately after

binations with offset SWR times. Example EPSC

strength was significantly less than that
observed with the correct SWR times

rect versus offset SWRs p < 0.05). Like-
wise, LTP was induced following stimula-
tion with CA3a-CA1d (Figure 4E; test

than that observed with the correct ripple

(relative

stimulation with CA3a-CA1c (Figure 4D;
test path, 1.61 ± 0.34; control path, 1.34 ± 0.32; test versus con-
trol pathway p > 0.05, n = 7) or CA3a-CA1c (Figure 4F; test path,
1.52 ± 0.58; control path, 1.45 ± 0.31; test versus control
pathway p > 0.05, n = 7). The reduction in LTP suggests the
timing of spikes within SWRs is critical for LTP induction.
To probe the relationship between spike and SWR timing with
higher temporal resolution, we investigated whether the timing of
SWR-associated synaptic stimulation could modulate synaptic
plasticity induced by artificial spike timing protocols (Figure 5A).
In agreement with previous studies (Pike et al., 1999; Buchanan
and Mellor, 2007), we found that one subthreshold EPSP fol-
lowed by one action potential (AP) 10 ms later, repeated 300
times at 5 Hz, did not induce LTP at SC-CA1 synapses (Fig-
ure 5B; test path, 1.04 ± 0.12; control path, 1.19 ± 0.21; test
versus control pathway p > 0.05, n = 7). Delivering the same pair-
ing 13 ms after the onset of an SWR-associated synaptic stimu-
lation induced pathway specific LTP (Figure 5C; test path, 2.34 ±
0.43; control path, 1.28 ± 0.16; test versus control pathway
p < 0.05, n = 9). However, delivering the same pairing 40 ms
later (53 ms after the onset of the SWR-associated synaptic

 stimulation) did not result in pathway-specific LTP (Figure 5D;
test path, 1.37 ± 0.33; control path, 1.04 ± 0.36; test versus con-
trol pathway p > 0.05, n = 6). This is not simply a form of associa-
tive plasticity coupling the strong ripple pathway with the weak
test pathway, as one EPSP alone delivered to the test pathway
13 ms after SWR onset failed to induce LTP (Figure 5E; test
path, 1.34 ± 0.28; control path, 1.18 ± 0.26; test versus control
pathway p > 0.05, n = 6). Together, these data show that the
timing of coincident pre- and postsynaptic activity in relation
to the SWR-associated synaptic stimulation is critical for
LTP induction. Furthermore, it suggests that CA3-CA1 spike
pairs in the first portion of an SWR are the most important for
inducing LTP.
Properties of Plasticity-Inducing Spike Trains
We found that the spike train capable of inducing the largest
change in synaptic strength (CA3a-CA1d) contained eight such
plasticity-potent events. These events were classified as a CA3
spike followed less than 30 ms later by a CA1 spike or burst
and occurred either just before (less than 30% of the SWR’s
duration before onset time) or during the first part of the SWR
duration (in the first 60% of a SWR) (Figure 6A). To test whether
these events were necessary for LTP induction, we removed the
ten CA1 spikes that constituted these events from spike train
CA3a-CA1d (Figure 6B). No LTP was induced by this spike train
following the removal of the ten CA1 spikes (Figure 6C; test path,
1.08 ± 0.17; control path, 0.99 ± 0.25; test versus control
pathway p > 0.05, n = 6). Next, we tested whether these spike
events were sufficient for LTP induction by delivering these
events alone. Again, no LTP was induced (Figure 6D; test path,
1.51 ± 0.26; control path, 1.28 ± 0.26; test versus control
pathway p > 0.05, n = 6). Nor was any LTP induced when the
intact spike train, which had previously induced robust LTP (Fig-
ure 2I), was used in the presence of the NMDA receptor antago-
nist DL-AP5 (Figure 6E; test path, 0.97 ± 0.20; control path, 0.87
± 0.19; test versus control pathway p > 0.05, n = 6). Hence,
based on this example, spiking events such as those defined
in Figure 6A are necessary, but not sufficient, for the induction
of NMDA-receptor-dependent LTP.
To test if the results from this example pair of place cells might
be generalized, we analyzed the number of such necessary spike
pairings within SWRs in each spike train protocol. The number of
necessary spike pairings within SWRs showed a strong correla-
tion with the change in synaptic strength induced by these spike
trains (Figure 7A; r2 = 0.89), supporting a model where LTP-
competent pairings have a probability of inducing stepwise
changes in synaptic strength (O’Connor et al., 2005). Other fac-
tors that might also predict change in synaptic strength, such as
CA1 bursts following CA3 spikes or total number of CA1 spikes,
did not correlate with induced change in synaptic strength (Fig-
ures 7B and 7C). These results support the conclusion that pairs
of CA3 and CA1 spikes that occur within a short time window
around the start of SWRs are the predominant factor influencing
LTP induction.

conditions compatible with induction of STDP (Bi and Poo,

chanan and Mellor, 2007), and thus facilitating learning and
memory (Girardeau et al., 2009; Ego-Stengel and Wilson, 2010;
Jadhav et al., 2012). However, direct demonstration of synaptic
plasticity induced by replayed activity during SWRs has not pre-
viously been provided. In this study, we have formally tested
these important hypotheses and found that reactivated place
cell firing patterns are able to induce LTP at SC-CA1 synapses
but require the additional excitatory synaptic input that CA1 cells
receive during SWRs in vivo. Causal spike pairs occurring near
SWR onset times are necessary for the induction of plasticity,
indicating that infra-ripple spike timing may be a critical

 determinant of plasticity in vivo. We hypothesize that this form of
synaptic plasticity has an important function in consolidating and
maintaining hippocampal representations of space.
Of the representative spike train pairs tested here, which were
simultaneously recorded from CA3 and CA1 place cells during a
post-run rest period, three were capable of inducing LTP given
SWR-associated synaptic stimulation. Though all the tested
spike trains had tightly cross-correlated spiking, CA3a-CA1e
did not have any causal events near SWR onset and did not
induce LTP under any conditions, supporting the conclusion
that the timing of spikes within SWRs is critical for LTP induction.
This might be expected given that CA3a and CA1e had the most
distant place fields for any of the CA3-CA1 pairs and therefore
their reactivation is expected to span the duration of SWRs.
Interestingly, even though there were plenty of acausal CA3
and CA1 spike timings, none of the tested spike trains induced
pathway specific LTD. This is similar to the situation for plasticity
induced by place cell firing patterns during exploration (Isaac
et al., 2009) and might be explained by a dominance for LTP
over LTD or the lack of STD-LTD exhibited at mature SC-CA1
synapses (Buchanan and Mellor, 2007; Tigaret et al., 2016)
compared to immature synapses which exhibit presynaptically
expressed STD-LTD (Sjo
¨ stro
¨ m et al., 2003; Bender et al., 2006;
Nevian and Sakmann, 2006; Rodrı
´guez-Moreno and Paulsen,
2008; Min and Nevian, 2012).
Artificially shifting the timing of SWR-associated synaptic
stimulation reduced or abolished LTP, indicating an important,
time-sensitive interaction between structured place cell firing
patterns and SWR-associated synaptic input. Indeed, we found
that SWR-associated synaptic stimulation can powerfully modu-
late STDP at mature SC-CA1 synapses. These findings demon-
strate how the temporal structure of reactivated place cell firing
patterns interacts dynamically with network oscillations to sculpt
plasticity in the hippocampus, providing important data to inform
models of the impact of plasticity’s impact on place cell firing
patterns (Mehta et al., 2000; Bush et al., 2010b). Indeed, previous
models have demonstrated the importance of bursts of coinci-
dent dendritic activity to induce LTP at distal synapses in the
absence of strong back-propagating action potentials (Kumar
and Mehta, 2011). Modeling studies also highlight the impor-
tance of spike timing to generate sufficient NMDAR activation
and subsequent Ca2+ influx into dendritic spines, which
strengthens synaptic connectivity between place cells with over-
lapping place fields and creates place cell assemblies (Mehta
et al., 2000; Bush et al., 2010b). However, such models rely on
experimental data to constrain the underlying STDP rules using
either phenomenological (Clopath et al., 2010) or biophysical
Ca2+-based models (Shouval et al., 2002; Rackham et al.,
2010; Kumar and Mehta, 2011). The latter make assumptions
about the relationship between total spine Ca2+ and LTP/LTD
based on the Ca2+ control hypothesis, which has been chal-
lenged by recent experimental evidence suggesting that the rela-
tive timing of Ca2+ release from distinct Ca2+ sources within den-
dritic spines, including NMDA receptors and voltage-gated Ca2+
channels, is key to the induction of STDP (Nevian and Sakmann,
2006; Tigaret et al., 2016). In many modeling studies, further

 assumptions are made for the existence of STD-LTD that are
critical for the stability of the model output but as discussed
above may be incorrect and therefore require reappraisal.
Thus, our data represent important information to update the as-
sumptions underlying STDP modeling for mature SC-CA1 syn-
apses that may reveal new insights into the role of synaptic plas-
ticity in place cell assembly formation.
How does SWR-associated excitatory input at one synaptic
locus influence the plasticity inducing potential of pre- and post-
synaptic activity patterns at a synaptic connection between two
place cells? One explanation is that the coincident activation of
two independent synaptic inputs induces an associative form
of LTP. However, this is unlikely to be the case, since the stimu-
lation of the test and ripple synaptic inputs in the absence of
postsynaptic action potentials was insufficient to induce LTP
(Figure 5E). Alternatively, the additional synaptic input and result-
ing dendritic depolarization may increase the amplitude of back-
propagating action potentials facilitating the activation of NMDA
receptors and LTP induction (Magee and Johnston, 1997). One
implication is that SWR-associated excitatory synaptic input en-
hances dendritic excitability and therefore lowers the threshold
for induction of plasticity. This is supported by many studies
showing that dendritic depolarization facilitates LTP induced
by spike pairings (reviewed in Williams et al., 2007) and that den-
dritic depolarization and LTP may be enhanced by the frequency
of spike pairings (Sjo
¨ stro
¨ m et al., 2001; Carlisle et al., 2008).
Furthermore, dendritic depolarization and LTP may be enhanced
by coincident synaptic inputs from SC and temperoammonic
pathways leading in some cases to dendritic plateau potentials,
which are strong predictors of synaptic plasticity (Golding et al.,
2002). Plateau potentials occurring during exploration have been
shown to be important for shaping place cell activity in vivo, pre-
sumably via the induction of synaptic plasticity (Gambino et al.,
2014; Bittner et al., 2015; Sheffield and Dombeck, 2015). While
these plateau potentials generated in distal dendrites by temper-
oammonic and SC input to CA1 pyramidal neurons are critical for
some forms of plasticity induced during awake behavior, we did
not see plateau potentials in our recordings, and during SWRs,
plateau potentials are largely absent (Bittner et al., 2015).
We conclude that an enhancement of dendritic depolarization
facilitates LTP induction during SWRs but is not reliant on the
generation of plateau potentials.
In the context of dendritic depolarization, the contribution of
inhibitory synaptic inputs associated with SWRs is also highly
relevant as a mechanism of potentially counteracting depolariza-
tion and inhibiting LTP induction (Groen et al., 2014). Inhibitory
inputs during SWRs are principally located on somatic rather
than dendritic compartments (Klausberger et al., 2003; Varga
et al., 2012), and our results suggest that reducing somatic excit-
ability does not significantly alter the threshold for plasticity
induced during SWRs. Furthermore, it has been shown that stim-
ulation of CA1 pyramidal neurons during SWRs in vivo enhances
subsequent CA1 excitability, suggesting that synaptic plasticity
during SWRs may be induced in the presence of inhibition (Buz-
sa
´ ki et al., 1987; King et al., 1999). However, the role of precisely
targeted inhibitory input during SWRs in regulating synaptic
plasticity remains to be elucidated. The enhancement of den-
dritic excitability during SWRs superficially predicts that late
causal spiking in SWRs will be more likely to induce plasticity.
One possible explanation for the importance of early rather
than late causal spiking is the slow onset of voltage- and Ca2+-
dependent potassium conductances that may reduce dendritic
excitability toward the end of SWRs. An example is Ca2+-depen-
dent potassium conductances (SK channels) that are present in
dendritic spines where they closely regulate NMDA receptor ac-
tivity (Faber et al., 2005; Ngo-Anh et al., 2005; Bloodgood and
Sabatini, 2007; Buchanan et al., 2010).
It has been suggested that ripple-associated replay in the hip-
pocampus allows recently encoded spatial engrams to become
consolidated though synaptic plasticity (O’Neill et al., 2010; Carr
et al., 2011; Sadowski et al., 2011). Neurons representing multi-
ple elements of the engram will fire together and therefore ‘‘wire
together.’’ However, since ripples boost firing rates across much
of the CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cell network, ensuring plasticity
only occurs at specific synapses may be problematic. The
intra-ripple timing dependent plasticity we demonstrate in this
study addresses this issue. Recently active cell assemblies un-
dergo a degree of potentiation during behavior (Isaac et al.,
2009), with enhanced connection strengths subsequently influ-
encing replay activity during rest and sleep. In addition, the
enhanced connectivity will make cells within the recently active
assembly more excitable, hence more likely to fire immediately
after ripple onset. Non-participating cells or cells that have
distant place fields and are therefore not tightly bound into the
ensemble during exploration (e.g., CA1e) may tend to fire later
in the ripple oscillation and not undergo plasticity. In this way, rip-
ples can act to promote and tune synaptic plasticity within the
hippocampal network, enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio within
the neural code. Previous studies have reported both forward
and reverse replay during rest (Foster and Wilson, 2006; Diba
and Buzsa
´ ki, 2007). Where extended replay sequences are con-
cerned, our data predict that reverse replay would enhance the
connectivity of place cells encoding proximal locations whereas
forward replay would enhance connectivity between cells en-
coding the beginning of a trajectory. The balance of forward
and reverse replay could therefore reflect task demands, with
forward replay occurring after an animal leaves a reward location
and reverse replay more likely when they arrive at a new one.
Sleep has an important role in learning and memory, but the
precise nature of this role is a matter of debate. Cuing the reac-
tivation of recently acquired information during slow-wave sleep
can enhance memory (Gais et al., 2006; Rudoy et al., 2009), sug-
gesting that replay in the hippocampus may support memory
consolidation (Born et al., 2006; Marshall and Born, 2007).
Others suggest that sleep provides a vital opportunity for synap-
tic downscaling (Vyazovskiy et al., 2008; Maret et al., 2011)
following cumulative potentiation during wakefulness and that
further potentiation during sleep could harm memory encoding
(Tononi and Cirelli, 2014). Our data suggest that brain activity
during quiescence, a state somewhere between sleep and
wakefulness, may enable the connectivity of specific spatial en-
grams to be enhanced prior to sleep, evidence that is compatible
with both theories of sleep function. These engrams may be pref-
erentially reactivated and consolidated in the cortex during sleep
(Rosanova and Ulrich, 2005; Chauvette et al., 2012); if synaptic
downscaling occurs, signal-to-noise ratio will be improved,
1926
Cell Reports 14, 1916–1929, March 1, 2016 ª2016 The Authors
 and these representations will become more salient (Grosmark
et al., 2012).
In conclusion, our results show that reactivated place cell firing
patterns can induce LTP when accompanied by SWR-associ-
ated synaptic input. These data confirm a widely held assump-
tion that reactivation during SWRs promotes synaptic plasticity.
They also suggest an active role for phasic excitatory input dur-
ing SWRs in tuning STDP in vivo. In future studies, it will be
important to investigate how SWR-dependent STDP can influ-
ence learning and memory directly.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Tetrode Implantation
All procedures were conducted in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific
Procedures) Act, 1986 and with the approval of the University of Bristol ethics
committee. Three adult (350–450 g) male Wistar rats (Charles River) were
chronically implanted with 19 extracellular tetrode recording electrodes (8
into CA3, 8 into CA1, and 3 into the white matter of the fimbria fornix in the right
dorsal hippocampus [�3.6 mm, +2.2 mm from bregma]) under isoflurane re-
covery anesthesia. During the 7–21 days following surgery, the independently
moveable tetrodes were lowered into the brain, targeting the pyramidal cell
layer in the dorsal CA1 and CA3 (verified by the characteristic burst mode of
single-unit firing and the presence of large-amplitude SWR events in the LFP
signal). Recordings were made using a Digital Lynx system (Neuralynx).
LFPs (sampled at 2 kHz and filtered between 0.1–475 Hz) and extracellular ac-
tion potentials (sampled at 30 kHz and filtered between 0.6–6 kHz) were re-
corded differentially using local references in the white matter overlying the
hippocampus. All channels were grounded to two screws placed in the skull
overlying the cerebellum. Final tetrode tip positions were verified histologically
by identifying sites of electrolytic lesions (Figure 1C) made at the end of exper-
imental procedures under terminal sodium pentobarbital anesthesia.
Recording Protocols
Animals were trained to run back and forth on a 200 3 10 cm linear track for a
small food reward for a period of 14 days prior to surgery. During these
14 days, animals were food restricted to 90% of free feeding body weight.
Recording sessions began once electrodes were in position 21 days after sur-
gery. In a familiar recording room, animals were first placed on a raised plat-
form in a rest box for a 15 min period before being moved to the track where
they were allowed to explore freely for 10 min. Animals were then placed
back in the sleep box for a further 15 min period. Animals did not receive
food reward on the track and were not food restricted prior to recording ses-
sions. Animal movement and behavior was monitored continuously by video.
Position on the track was tracked using light-emitting diodes attached to a
powered headstage (Cheetah Software; Neuralynx).
In Vivo Data Analysis
All data were processed in MatLab (MATHWORKS) unless stated otherwise.
Single units were isolated manually offline using MClust 3.5 (A.D. Redish, avail-
able at http://redishlab.neuroscience.umn.edu/MClust/MClust.html); inclu-
sion criteria were set to isolation distance > 15.0 and L-ratio < 0.35. Putative
pyramidal cells were classified on the basis of the spike width, waveform,
and mean firing rate. Ripples were detected offline in the LFP recorded on
one CA1 channel. Raw LFP signal was filtered between 120 and 250 Hz,
and deflections in the ripple power envelope greater than 5 SDs from the
mean were classified as ripple events. Ripple start times were defined locally
as when ripple power exceeded 2 SDs. Samples of raw LFP and detected rip-
ple times were compared manually to verify detection fidelity. For place cell
analysis, the track area was divided into 10 3 10 cm bins, and mean firing rates
for each neuron in each bin were calculated.
Slice Preparation
Brain slices were prepared from adult (10- to 12-week-old) male Wistar rats
following a lethal dose of anesthetic (isoflurane inhalation). Brains were
dissected in ice-cold cutting solution containing 119 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl,
1 mM NaH2PO4, 26.2 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM glucose, 1.3 mM CaCl2, and
2.5 mM MgSO4 equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Coronal slices 300–
400 mm thick were cut from the dorsal hippocampus using a vibratome (Leica
LS1200), and slices were incubated in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) con-
taining 119 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 26.2 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM
glucose, 2.5 mM CaCl2, and 1.3 mM MgSO4 at 36�C for 30 min and then stored
at room temperature until use. Before being transferred to the recording cham-
ber, a cut was made between CA3 and CA1.
Whole-Cell Patch-Clamp Recordings
Recordings were made in a submerged chamber perfused with aCSF
(as above) at 34�C with the addition of 50 mM picrotoxin to block GABAA-
receptor-mediated transmission to enable accurate measurement of mono-
synaptic excitatory connections between hippocampal pyramidal cells. CA1
pyramidal cells were visualized using infrared DIC optics on an Olympus
BX-51 microscope. Patch electrodes with a resistance of 4–5 MU were
pulled from borosilicate filamented glass capillaries (Harvard Apparatus) us-
ing a vertical puller (PC-10, Narashige). Pipettes were filled with intracellular
solution containing 120 mM KMeSO3, 10 mM HEPES, 0.2 mM EGTA, 4 mM
Mg-ATP, 0.3 mM Na-GTP, 8 mM NaCl, and 10 mM KCl (pH 7.4), 280–285
mOsm.
Recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons were made with an Axopatch 200B
or a Multiclamp 700A amplifier (Molecular Devices, USA), filtered at 4–5 kHz
and digitized at 10 kHz using a data acquisition board and signal acquisition
software (CED). Cells were voltage clamped at �70 mV (junction potential
correction of �11 mV not accounted for). Series resistance was monitored
throughout the experiments and cells that showed a >20% change were
discarded.
Synaptic responses were evoked in control and test pathways with 100-
ms-square voltage steps applied at 0.1 Hz through two bipolar stimulating
electrodes located in stratum radiatum. A third stimulation pathway in stratum
radiatum was used to simulate SWR-associated synaptic stimulation and
dendritic depolarization during plasticity induction. The three pathways were
tested regularly to ensure independence by paired-pulse protocols (Figure S1).
Postsynaptic action potentials were initiated through somatic current injec-
tions (2 ms duration, 2 nA amplitude).
Replay of Place Cell Spike Patterns
Small amplitude EPSCs (typically 20–40 pA) were recorded in visually identi-
fied CA1 pyramidal cells voltage clamped at �70 mV. The stimulation intensity
of each input pathway was tuned to elicit sub-threshold EPSPs following a five
pulses at 100 Hz stimulus prior to baseline recording. EPSCs were recorded in
voltage clamp from two independent pathways for a baseline period of 5 min.
Spike train stimulation and spike timing protocols were applied after the neu-
rons were switched to current-clamp mode within 10 min of reaching the
whole-cell configuration. The resting membrane potential of the neurons
was �70.0 ± 0.5 mV. Following induction, responses to both test and control
pathway stimulation were monitored for a further 30–34 min in voltage-clamp
mode (Figure 2D).
In Vitro Data Analysis
Measurements were made from averages of six traces to give one data point
per minute. Average data are presented as mean ± SEM. Data were normal-
ized to the average baseline response. Data comparisons were made between
test and control pathways at 25–30 min after plasticity induction using Stu-
dent’s paired two-tailed t test with a significance level of p < 0.05. For be-
tween-dataset comparisons of plasticity induction, relative change in synaptic
strength (mean test minus mean control pathway response during the final
5 min of the experiment) was calculated for each experiment and values
compared using an unpaired Student’s two-tailed t test.
