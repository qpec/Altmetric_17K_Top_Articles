Abstract: 
16 
To follow a straight course, animals must maintain a constant heading relative to a 
17 
fixed, distant landmark, a strategy termed menotaxis. In experiments using a flight 
18 
simulator, we found that Drosophila adopt arbitrary headings with respect to a 
19 
simulated sun, and individuals remember their heading preference between successive 
20 
flights—even over gaps lasting several hours. Imaging experiments revealed that a class 
21 
of neurons within the central complex, which have been previously shown to act as an 
22 
internal compass, track the azimuthal motion of a sun stimulus. When these neurons 
23 
are silenced, flies no longer adopt and maintain arbitrary headings, but instead exhibit 
24 
frontal phototaxis. Thus, without the compass system, flies lose the ability to execute 
25 
menotaxis and revert to a simpler, reflexive behavior.

Despite their small brains, insects can navigate over long distances – in some cases, 
28 
thousands of kilometers – by orienting to sensory cues such as visual landmarks (1), 
29 
skylight polarization (2–9) and the position of the sun (3, 4, 6, 10).  Although Drosophila 
30 
are not generally renowned for their navigational abilities, mark-and-recapture 
31 
experiments in Death Valley revealed that they can fly nearly 15 km across open desert 
32 
over the course of a single evening (11). To accomplish such feats on available energy 
33 
reserves (12), flies would have to maintain relatively straight headings and rely on 
34 
celestial cues to do so (13).  
35 
 
36 
Celestial cues such as sun position and polarized light are thought to be integrated in 
37 
the central complex, a set of highly conserved unpaired neuropils in the central brain of 
38 
arthropods (14). Central complex neurons in locusts (15), dung beetles (4), and monarch 
39 
butterflies (16) respond to the angle of polarized light and the position of small bright 
40 
objects mimicking the sun or moon. Extracellular recordings from the central complex 
41 
in cockroaches revealed neurons that act as head-direction cells in the absence of visual 
42 
cues or relative to a visual landmark (17). Recently, a group of cells (E-PG neurons) in 
43 
the Drosophila central complex have been shown to function as an internal compass (18–
44 
20), similar to head-direction cells in mammals (21). Using the wide array of genetic 
45 
tools available to measure and manipulate cell function in Drosophila, we set out to test 
46 
whether flies can navigate using the sun and to identify the role of E-PG cells in this 
47 
behavior.   
48 
 
49 
We tested the hypothesis that Drosophila can use the sun to navigate by placing tethered 
50 
wild-type female flies in a flight simulator and presenting an ersatz sun stimulus (Fig. 
51 
1A).  The fly was surrounded by an array of LEDs on which we presented either a 
52 
single 2.3° bright spot on a dark background or a 15°-wide dark vertical stripe on a 
53 
bright background. Given previous studies on other species (4, 15, 16), we expect that

flies react to our small bright spot as they would to the actual sun, and thus we call it a 
55 
‘sun stimulus’. Experiments were conducted in closed loop, such that the difference in 
56 
stroke amplitude between the fly’s two wings determined the angular velocity of the 
57 
stimulus (12). Flies generally maintained the dark stripe in front of them (Fig. 1C, D), a 
58 
well-characterized behavior termed stripe fixation (22–24). However, when presented 
59 
with the sun stimulus, individual flies adopted arbitrary headings, thus exhibiting 
60 
menotaxis (Fig. 1B, D).  We quantified how well flies maintained a heading by 
61 
calculating vector strength, which is the magnitude of the mean of all instantaneous 
62 
unit heading vectors for the entire flight. A vector strength of 1 would indicate that a fly 
63 
held the stimulus at the exact same heading during the entire flight bout. Because we 
64 
tested each individual with both a stripe and sun stimulus, we could compare the flies’ 
65 
performance under the two conditions. We found no correlation between the mean 
66 
heading exhibited by individual flies during sun menotaxis and stripe fixation (Fig. 1E), 
67 
suggesting that heading preference for the sun stimulus is independent of the response 
68 
to a vertical stripe. To ensure that flies’ stabilization of the sun stimulus was not an 
69 
artifact of our feedback system, we also conducted control closed-loop experiments in 
70 
which the bright spot was switched off.  As expected, the flies exhibited no orientation 
71 
behavior under this condition, with all vector strength values lower than 0.16 (Fig. 1D). 
72 
Collectively, these experiments indicate that flies are capable of orienting to a small 
73 
bright spot and that this behavior is distinct from stripe fixation.  Drosophila can also 
74 
perform menotaxis using the axis of linearly polarized light (8, 9, 25). It is not known 
75 
whether the orientation responses of flies to the sun and polarized light are 
76 
independent, as they are in dung beetles (4), or linked to create a matched filter of the 
77 
sky, as they are in locusts (15).       
78 
 
79 
Given that individual flies adopted arbitrary headings with respect to the sun stimulus, 
80 
we tested whether they retained a memory of their orientation preference from one

flight to the next.  We presented flies with the sun stimulus in closed loop, interrupted 
82 
flight for a defined interval (5 min, 1, 2, or 6 hours), and then again presented the sun 
83 
stimulus. To provide an independent metric of flight performance, we also presented a 
84 
stripe under closed loop conditions for 1 min before the first sun bout and after the 
85 
second. Across inter-flight intervals of 5 minutes, 1 hours, and 2 hours, flies remained 
86 
loyal to their first heading during the second flight (Fig. 1F). If each fly adopted the 
87 
identical heading in both flights, the mean heading difference would be zero, whereas if 
88 
there was no correlation in heading from one flight to the next, the mean absolute value 
89 
of the heading difference would be 90°, provided that the orientations were uniformly 
90 
distributed. To test whether the consistency in flight-to-flight orientation could arise 
91 
from chance, we bootstrapped 10,000 random pairs of mean heading values from the 
92 
first and second flights and compared the resulting distribution with the mean absolute 
93 
heading difference of the actual data (Figure 1G). In all cases, the measured mean 
94 
difference was less than that of the bootstrapped values (5 min: 54.2° vs. 79.2°; 1 hour: 
95 
66.6° vs. 77.4°; 2 hours: 66.8° vs. 84.8°; 6 hours: 71.0° vs. 75.5°).  We calculated 
96 
probability values directly from the proportion of the 10,000 bootstrapped simulations 
97 
that resulted in a smaller mean absolute angle difference than the observed data (Fig. 
98 
1G). With the exception of the 6-hour gap, this probability was quite low (5 min: p=0.00; 
99 
1 hour: p=0.03; 2 hours: p=0.001; 6 hours, p=0.084). Collectively, these results suggest 
100 
that headings are not selected at random with each subsequent takeoff, but rather that 
101 
flies remember their headings from previous flights, at least for up to 2 hours. A similar 
102 
result was found for the orientation responses to linearly polarized light (8). Fully 
103 
determining the mechanisms by which flies attain their initial heading preference (i.e. 
104 
genetic vs. developmental vs. learning) require experiments that are beyond the scope 
105 
of this current study.

The finding that flies remember their flight heading for at least 2 hours makes 
108 
ethological sense. Drosophila are crepuscular, exhibiting dawn and dusk activity peaks 
109 
(26).  Assuming our laboratory measurements are representative of dispersal events, a 
110 
memory that allows an individual to fly straight for a few hours would be sufficient to 
111 
bias a day’s migration in one direction. To our knowledge, there is no evidence that 
112 
Drosophila make multi-day, long-distance migrations that would require the ability to 
113 
maintain a constant course from one day to the next or a time-compensated sun 
114 
compass. The most parsimonious ecological interpretation of their sun orientation 
115 
behavior is that it allows flies to disperse opportunistically to new sources of food and 
116 
oviposition sites within a single day.  
117 
 
118 
The visual information conveying sun position likely provides inputs to the recently 
119 
identified neurons constituting the fly’s internal compass (18–20). These columnar 
120 
neurons receive input in the ellipsoid body and send divergent output to the 
121 
protocerebral bridge and gall, and are hence named E-PG neurons (27). These neurons 
122 
track azimuthal position of vertical stripes and more complex visual stimuli, and in the 
123 
absence of visual input can continue to track azimuthal orientation by integrating 
124 
estimates of angular velocity (18, 20, 28). Given these functional attributes, an obvious 
125 
question is whether E-PG neurons respond to a sun stimulus and whether they exhibit 
126 
different responses to other visual stimuli. We used the split-GAL4 line SS00096 (28), 
127 
which expresses in the E-PG neurons, to drive the genetically encoded calcium indicator 
128 
GCaMP6f, and measured activity in tethered, flying flies using a 2-photon microscope 
129 
(Fig. 2A).  As described previously, the set of 16 E-PG neurons tile the toroidally shaped 
130 
ellipsoid body. Notably, a region of activity, or ‘bump’, rotates around the ellipsoid 
131 
body corresponding to azimuthal position (18, Movies S1, S2). Instead of recording from 
132 
the ellipsoid body, we imaged the activity at E-PG terminals in the protocerebral bridge 
133 
(Fig. 2B) because fluorescence signals were stronger in these more superficial glomeruli.

Based on well-established anatomy, we re-mapped the neural activity in the medial 16 
135 
glomeruli of the protocerebral bridge into the circular reference frame of azimuthal 
136 
space (Fig. 2C, 27) and computed a neural activity vector average, or bump position, for 
137 
each image (similar to 28; see Materials and Methods for details).  
138 
 
139 
As in our flight arena experiments (Fig 1A), flies adopted arbitrary headings with 
140 
respect to the sun stimulus (Fig. 2G, H), which they maintained over a 5-minute break 
141 
(Fig 2G).  By presenting sun and stripe stimuli to the same fly, we tested whether these 
142 
two stimulus types are represented differently by the E-PG neurons. Bump position 
143 
faithfully tracked the position of both the sun and stripe stimuli (Fig. 2D-F). Prior 
144 
studies found that while the E-PG bump tracks the azimuthal position of a vertical 
145 
stripe, it does so with an arbitrary azimuthal angular offset (18). We found an identical 
146 
result with the sun stimulus; the bump rotated with changes in sun position, but with a 
147 
bump-to-stimulus offset that varied from individual to individual. In addition, the 
148 
bump-to-stimulus offset did not differ between the first and second sun presentation 
149 
trials or between the sun and stripe presentation trails (Fig 2J, K). The offset was not 
150 
correlated with the azimuthal angle at which individual flies tended to hold the sun 
151 
(Fig. 2I). Together, these imaging results suggest that the representation of the sun and 
152 
stripe in the E-PG neurons is similar despite the distinct behavioral responses to the 
153 
stimuli, and that the bump-to-stimulus offset does not encode heading preference.   
154 
 
155 
We next tested the causal contributions of E-PG neurons to sun navigation and stripe 
156 
fixation, predicting that the highly variable headings adopted in sun navigation might 
157 
require the instantaneous positional information provided by E-PG neurons. We took 
158 
advantage of the sparse expression patterns of three different split-GAL4 lines (Fig. 3A) 
159 
to selectively drive the inwardly rectifying potassium channel Kir2.1 (29).  As a control, 
160 
we crossed UAS-Kir2.1 to an engineered split-GAL4 line that was genetically identical

to the experimental driver lines, but carried empty vectors of the two GAL4 domains in 
162 
the two insertion sites (30). Driving Kir2.1 in three, separate split-GAL4 lines yielded 
163 
flies that lost the ability to maintain the sun at arbitrary azimuthal positions, although 
164 
they could fixate the sun and stripe frontally. To assess the degree to which this effect 
165 
could have occurred by chance, we employed a bootstrapping approach similar to that 
166 
used in our time gap experiments. We randomly selected 50 values from our control 
167 
dataset 10,000 times, in each case calculating the circular variance of the subsampled 
168 
population.  We then determined the proportion of bootstrapped mean variances that 
169 
had smaller values than the variance of the actual experimental data and concluded that 
170 
the observed frontal distributions of our experimental groups were highly unlikely to 
171 
have occurred by chance (SS00096: p=0.000; SS00408: p=0.000; SS00131: p=0.004). Thus, 
172 
E-PG neuron activity appears necessary for menotaxis, i.e. maintaining the sun in 
173 
arbitrary non-frontal positions. To our knowledge, this is the first behavioral deficit 
174 
elicited via experimental manipulation of the compass cell network.  
175 
 
176 
In the absence of normal E-PG function, flies might directly orient toward the sun 
177 
because they lack the ability to compare their instantaneous heading to a stored value of 
178 
their directional preference. Such a loss of function in the compass network might 
179 
unmask a simpler reflexive behavior – phototaxis – that does not require the elaborate 
180 
circuitry of the central complex. Consistent with this hypothesis, stripe fixation was not 
181 
different between control and experimental animals. This interpretation is compatible 
182 
with a recent model that showed frontal object fixation could result from a simple 
183 
circuit involving two asymmetric wide-field motion integrators, without the need for 
184 
the central complex (31).  
185 
 
186 
Our findings are consistent with an emerging model of a navigational circuit involving 
187 
the central complex.  E-PG cells have an excitatory relationship with another cell class in

the central complex (protocerebral bridge-ellipsoid body-noduli or P-EN neurons), 
189 
creating an angular velocity integrator that allows a fly to maintain its heading in the 
190 
absence of visual landmarks (19, 20).  Furthermore, the E-PG neurons are homologous 
191 
to the CL1 neurons described in locusts (32), monarchs (16), dung beetles (4), and bees 
192 
(33) and likely serve similar functions across taxa. In an anatomy-based model of path 
193 
integration in bees, CL1 neurons are part of a columnar circuit that provides 
194 
instantaneous heading information to an array of self-excitatory networks that also 
195 
receive convergent optic flow information, thereby storing a memory of distance 
196 
traveled in each direction (33). This information is then retrieved as an animal returns 
197 
home by driving appropriate steering commands in other classes of central complex 
198 
neurons. The putative memory cells suggested by this model, CPU4 cells, could be 
199 
homologous to protocerebral bridge-fan shaped body-noduli (P-FN) neurons described 
200 
for Drosophila (27). Furthermore, cells responsive to progressive optic flow are found 
201 
throughout the central complex of flies, including neuropil in the fan-shaped body 
202 
containing the P-FN cells (34). The authors of the recent path integration model suggest 
203 
that the CPU4 network in bees might also function to store the desired heading during 
204 
sun navigation (33). Although our results do not directly test this model, they are 
205 
consistent with the role of CL1 neurons in providing heading direction to circuits that 
206 
generate steering commands towards an arbitrary orientation whose memory is stored 
207 
in the network of CPU4 (P-FN) neurons. 
208 
 
209 
Stripe fixation and sun navigation behaviors may represent two different flight modes 
210 
in Drosophila.  Stripe fixation is thought to be a short-range behavioral reflex to orient 
211 
towards near objects (12), which in free flight is quickly terminated by collision 
212 
avoidance (13) or landing behaviors (35).  In contrast, navigation using the sun is likely 
213 
a component of long-distance dispersal behavior that could be used in conjunction with 
214 
polarization vision (8, 9) either in a hierarchical (4) or integrative (36) manner.

Individuals could differ in where they lie on the continuum of long-range dispersal to 
216 
local search, which could explain the inter-individual variation we observed in heading 
217 
fidelity during sun orientation experiments. In general, dispersal is a condition-
218 
dependent behavior that is known to vary with hunger or other internal factors (37).  
219 
 
220 
Given the architectural similarity of the central complex among species (14), the celestial 
221 
compass we have identified in Drosophila is likely one module within a conserved 
222 
behavioral toolkit (13) allowing orientation and flight over long distances by integrating 
223 
skylight polarization, the position of the sun or moon, and other visual cues. An 
224 
independent study has recently found that the E-PG compass neurons are also 
225 
necessary in walking flies for maintaining arbitrary headings relative to a small bright 
226 
object (38). The expanding array of genetic tools developed for flies as well as the rapid 
227 
growth in our understanding of the neural circuitry involved in orientation during 
228 
walking (18–20) and flight (28) make this a promising system for exploring such 
229 
essential and highly conserved behaviors.

372 
Experimental animals 
373 
We conducted all experiments using 2-4 day old female Drosophila melanogaster.  Our 
374 
initial analysis of sun orientation behavior (Fig. 1) was conducted using flies from a 
375 
wild-caught strain (‘top banana’) collected in Seattle, WA and maintained in the lab 
376 
since September 2013. We reared flies in incubators on a 12 hour light: 12 hour dark 
377 
cycle at 25°C on standard cornmeal fly food. For the functional imaging experiments 
378 
(Fig. 2), we used flies heterozygous for w+;UAS-tdTomato;UAS-GCaMP6f (39) and the 
379 
split-Gal4 line SS00096 (28).  For silencing experiments (Fig. 3), we crossed a 
380 
backcrossed version of UAS-Kir2.1 with SS00096, SS00131, and SS00408 (kindly 
381 
provided by Tanya Wolff at Janelia Research Campus). The controls in our silencing 
382 
experiments were the progeny of the UAS-Kir2.1 line and an engineered split-GAL4 line 
383 
in which the two insertion sites carried empty vectors of the two GAL4 domains, but 
384 
were otherwise genetically identical to the experimental driver lines (30).  We generated 
385 
flies for confocal imaging by crossing UAS-myr:GFP; UAS-red-Stinger with each of the 
386 
split-GAL4 lines.   
387 
 
388 
Fly tethering 
389 
For sun orientation (Fig. 1) and genetic silencing experiments (Fig. 3), we tethered flies 
390 
under cold anesthesia and glued them to a tungsten wire (0.13 mm diameter) at the 
391 
anterior dorsal portion of the scutum with UV-cured glue (Bondic Inc.). We also fixed 
392 
the head of each fly to its thorax by applying an additional drop of glue.  Flies were 
393 
allowed to recover for at least 10 minutes prior to testing.   
394 
 
395 
For functional imaging experiments (Fig. 2), we tethered each fly to a specially designed 
396 
physiology stage (40) that permitted access to the posterior side of the fly’s head.  We

filled the holder with saline, and removed a section of cuticle overlying the region of the 
398 
central complex. To improve imaging quality, we removed adipose bodies and trachea 
399 
from the light path. Flies were continuously perfused with saline (41) which was 
400 
actively regulated to a temperature of 21°C. We allowed flies a minimum of 20 minutes 
401 
to recover from cold-anesthesia prior to imaging. 
402 
 
403 
Flight arenas and stimulus presentation 
404 
For sun-orientation behavior (Fig. 1) and genetic silencing experiments (Fig. 3), we 
405 
placed tethered flies in an LED flight simulator (42) (Fig. 1A).  We displayed patterns on 
406 
a circular arena of either 12 x 1 (Fig. 1) or 12 x 2 (Fig. 3) LED panels, with each panel 
407 
consisting of an 8 x 8 array of individual pixels (Betlux #BL-M12A881PG-11, l=525 nm). 
408 
Each pixel subtended an angle of 2.8° at the center of the arena with a 0.93° gap between 
409 
adjacent pixels. The panels were controlled using hardware and firmware 
410 
(IORodeo.com) as described previously (42), with slight modifications in current 
411 
sinking required to display a single bright pixel without generating bleed-through on 
412 
other pixels in the same panel row. We placed the fly in the center of the arena at a body 
413 
angle of ~60°, approximating the orientation during free flight (43).  For wing tracking, 
414 
flies were backlit with a collimated infrared source (850 nm, 900mW; Thorlabs Inc. 
415 
#M850L3).  We placed a 45° mirror below the fly and used a firewire camera (Basler 
416 
A602f-2) or a Point Grey USB 3.0 camera (now FLIR, Blackfly 0.3MP monochrome 
417 
camera, BFLY-U3-03S2M-CS) for image capture.  Each camera was equipped with a 
418 
Computar macro lens (MLM3X-MP) and IR-pass filter (Hoya B-46RM72-GB) to exclude 
419 
extraneous light from the LED display.  
420 
 
421 
To track the wing stroke envelope during flight, we used Kinefly, real-time machine-
422 
vision software developed in the lab (44). As in previous studies (12), we used the 
423 
difference in wing beat amplitude (∆WBA) as a feedback signal by which the fly could

control the angular velocity of the visual stimulus. The gain of this control relationship 
425 
was set to 14.67, 5.88, or 4.75° sec-1 for each °∆WBA for sun orientation experiments (Fig. 
426 
1), functional imaging (Fig. 2), and genetic silencing (Fig. 3), respectively. We found that 
427 
a lower feedback gain was required in our experiments with transgenic lines to generate 
428 
stable orientation behavior to both sun and stripe stimuli.   
429 
 
430 
For functional imaging experiments, we presented visual stimuli using a 12 x 4 panel 
431 
(96 x 32 pixel) arena, which covered 216° of azimuth with a resolution of ~2.25°. To 
432 
reduce light pollution from the LED arena into the photomultiplier tubes of the 2-
433 
photon microscope, we shifted the spectral peak of the visual stimuli from 470 nm to 
434 
450 nm by placing two transmission filters in front of the LEDs (Roscolux no. 59 Indigo 
435 
and no. 39 Skelton Exotic Sangria). We tracked wing stroke angles using Kinefly and 
436 
presented stimuli in closed-loop as described above, except that we illuminated the 
437 
wings using four horizontal fiber-optic IR light sources (Thorlabs Inc. #M850F2) 
438 
distributed in a ~90° arc behind the fly.  
439 
 
440 
For data presented in Figs. 1 and 3, a single pixel served as our ersatz sun.  At the plane 
441 
of the fly, a single pixel subtends a maximum angle of 2.8°. However, because the fly 
442 
was placed ~30° below the plane of the illuminated pixel, the simulated sun subtended 
443 
a maximum angle of ~2.3° at the fly’s retina, which is larger than the sun’s angular 
444 
diameter ( ~0.5°), but smaller than the inter-ommatidial acceptance angle of ~5° (45). For 
445 
sun orientation experiments (Fig. 1), we conducted all trials in a 12 x 1 panel (96 x 8 
446 
pixel) arena. For stripe fixation, we presented a 4 pixel-wide dark stripe (15° wide x 30° 
447 
high) on a bright background.  
448 
 
449 
To determine the visual contrast flies experienced during our experiments, we 
450 
measured the normalized difference between the lightest and darkest parts of the

display (Michelson contrast).  We placed a small metal tube covered in black electrical 
452 
tape over a power sensor (Thorlabs S170C, PM100D) to reduce reflections and 
453 
approximate the acceptance angle of an ommatidium (~5°).  We held the sensor at the 
454 
center of the arena and directed it toward a sun or stripe to measure the stimulus light 
455 
level and then moved the stimulus 45° in azimuth to measure the background light 
456 
level. The Michelson contrast for all sun stimulus experiments was 0.99 and stripe 
457 
contrast was 0.75 and 0.74 for the data presented in Fig. 1 and Fig. 3 respectively.   
458 
 
459 
The behavior of flies from the control line (UAS-Kir; split-GAL4-empty-vector) was 
460 
generally similar to wild type flies; however, they tended to perform poorly in the 
461 
stripe-fixation paradigm, as indicated by relatively low vector strength (Fig. 3B) and a 
462 
smaller proportion of flies that completed the trial without stopping. Given that flies’ 
463 
azimuthal control of a stripe stimulus improves as a function of increasing stripe height 
464 
(24), we doubled the height of the visual display to a stripe of ~58° (12 x 2 panels, 96 x 16 
465 
pixels) for our genetic silencing experiments (Fig. 3). We noted that reflections 
466 
generated by a single bright pixel on the faceted inner surface of the arena generated a 
467 
faint dark stripe on the column of panels on which the sun stimulus was displayed. To 
468 
guard against the possibility that the fly would orient to this reflection feature, we 
469 
fabricated cylindrical inserts of black velvet that obscured the surface of the display 
470 
except for a narrow slit (9 mm x 360°) that contained the LED row in which the sun 
471 
stimulus was displayed. The insert could be quickly removed without disturbing the fly 
472 
for trials using a stripe stimulus. To facilitate the collection of large sample sizes for the 
473 
genetic silencing experiments, we constructed two identical arenas, which we operated 
474 
in parallel. 
475 
 
476 
In the functional imaging experiments (Fig. 2) we compensated for a larger arena and 
477 
dimmer LEDs by using a 3.6° x 3.6° spot (2 x 2 pixels) as our sun stimulus, with a

Michelson contrast of 0.92. The stripe stimulus consisted of a 12.6° wide x 64° high 
479 
vertical bright stripe presented on a dark background, with a Michelson contrast of 0.93.  
480 
Using a bright stripe on a dark background was necessary in order not to saturate the 
481 
PMTs. Flies exhibit less robust fixation under these conditions (42) but nevertheless 
482 
performed the behavior, allowing us to compare sun- and stripe- fixation during 
483 
functional imaging.  
484 
 
485 
Sun orientation and time gap experiments 
486 
To test the persistence of flight headings, we presented flies with the sun stimulus in 
487 
closed loop, provided a rest period between flights for either 5 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 
488 
or 6 hours, and then tested flies in a second bout with a sun stimulus. Before and after 
489 
the sun stimulus trials, we presented flies with a stripe for 1 minute. For 5-minute inter-
490 
trial intervals, we left the fly in the arena and stopped flight by presenting a small piece 
491 
of paper. To prevent dehydration during longer inter-trial intervals (1, 2 and 6 hours), 
492 
we removed the fly from the arena and placed it on a small foam ball floating in a 
493 
microcentrifuge tube filled with water. Following this rest period, we returned the fly to 
494 
the arena and the second flight was initiated by providing a small puff of air. We 
495 
discarded trials in which any fly stopped flying more than once during any of the stripe 
496 
or sun presentations.

2-photon functional imaging 
499 
We imaged at an excitation wavelength of 930 nm using a galvanometric scan mirror-
500 
based two-photon microscope (Thorlabs, Inc., Newton, NJ, USA) equipped with a 
501 
Nikon CFI Plan Fluorite objective water-immersion lens (10x mag., 0.3 N.A., 3.5 mm 
502 
W.D.). With the addition of a piezo-ceramic linear objective drive (P-726, Physik 
503 
Instrumente GmbH and Co. KG, Karlsruhe, Germany) we imaged two x-y planes 
504 
separated by 25 µm along the z axis. Within the resulting volume we recorded

tdTomato and GCaMP6f fluorescence in those glomeruli of the protocerebral bridge 
506 
(PB) that contain terminals of E-PG neurons. We scanned in a boustrophedon pattern 
507 
from ventral to dorsal to align the piezo drive descent during each plane scan with the 
508 
anatomical inclination of the PB, maximizing the volumetric capture of the target 
509 
glomeruli. We acquired the 142 x 71 µm images with 128 x 64 pixel resolution at 13.1 
510 
Hz. The 2-plane scan with one fly-back frame resulted in a 4.36 Hz volumetric scan rate. 
511 
To correct for motion in the x-y plane, we registered both channels for each frame by 
512 
finding the peak of the cross correlation between each tdTomato image and the trial-
513 
averaged image (46). Subsequently, we collapsed the two planes with a maximum z-
514 
projection. Based on known anatomy, we manually assigned a region of interest (ROI) 
515 
to each PB glomerulus with E-PG neuron innervation. For each volumetric frame, we 
516 
computed fluorescence (Ft) of the GCaMP6f signal by subtracting the mean of the 
517 
background pixels from the mean of the ROI pixels for each glomerulus. The 
518 
background was defined as the 10% dimmest pixels across the entire z-projected image 
519 
for each fly. We normalized the fluorescence in the ROI of each glomerulus to its 
520 
baseline fluorescence (F0) as follows: ΔF/F = (Ft – F0)/F0 and defined F0 as the mean of the 
521 
10% lowest GCaMP6f fluorescence in the ROI of each glomerulus. Under closed-loop 
522 
conditions, we presented each fly with a sun stimulus twice for five minutes, separated 
523 
by a minimum of 5 minutes. A 2-minute presentation of the stripe stimulus followed the 
524 
second sun stimulus trial.

Functional silencing of E-PG neurons in sun navigation behavior 
527 
We tested all control and experimental flies with a paradigm consisting of 5 minutes of 
528 
sun stimulus presentation, a 5-minute break, 5 minutes of sun presentation, and 5 
529 
minutes of stripe presentation. We discarded trials in which flies stopped more than 
530 
twice per stimulus presentation.

Immunohistochemistry of split-GAL4 lines 
533 
We dissected and stained brains of flies expressing UAS-myr:GFP, UAS-redStinger and 
534 
each of the three split-GAL4 lines (SS00096, SS00131, SS00408) using modifications to 
535 
standard laboratory immunohistochemistry protocols (44).  We dissected brains in 4% 
536 
formaldehyde fixative.  After a 20-30 minute fixation, we washed tissue 2 x 20 minutes 
537 
in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by a permeabilization step of 2 x 20 minute 
538 
washes in phosphate buffered saline with 0.5% Triton-X (PBST).  We incubated tissue 
539 
with primary antibodies anti-GFP AlexaFluor™ 488 conjugate (1:1000 concentration, 
540 
Invitrogen # A21311) and anti-nc82 to label neuropil (1:10 concentration, Developmental 
541 
Studies Hybridoma Bank, AB 2314866) in 5% normal goat serum in PBST overnight on a 
542 
nutator at 4°C.  The following day, we washed with PBST 3 x 20 min and incubated 
543 
with a secondary antibody to anti-nc82 (AlexaFluor™ 633, 1:250 concentration, 
544 
Invitrogen # A21050) overnight at 4 °C. Brains were washed 3 x 20 min with PBST and 2 
545 
x 20 min with PBS the following day.  We dehydrated brains through an ethanol series 
546 
(30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, 100%, 100%, each for 10 min), cleared tissue with xylene (2 x 10 
547 
min) and mounted in DPX (47).  Using a Leica SP8, we imaged brains under a 63x 
548 
objective (Leica #506350, 1.4 N.A.).  Maximium intensity projections were generated in 
549 
Fiji (48, 49).    
550 
 
551 
Quantification and statistical analysis 
552 
We processed and analyzed all data in Python 2.7 and Matplotlib (50).  Before making 
553 
pairwise comparisons of mean heading direction in separate flights (as in Fig 1E, F), we 
554 
excluded trials with a vector strength under 0.2 (36.2% of all trials). Mean headings for 
555 
flights with very low vector strength are not meaningful, as this indicates that the fly 
556 
did not select a heading during the trial. However, including all data did not 
557 
qualitatively change the relationship between first and second flights.

To assess whether heading fidelity was maintained over time gaps, we bootstrapped 
560 
random pairings of first and second sun presentation trials 10,000 times.  We compared 
561 
the distribution of the mean absolute value of heading difference between the flights for 
562 
these simulated data sets to the mean absolute value of heading difference of the 
563 
observed data. We calculated the p-value as the proportion of simulated data sets that 
564 
had a mean heading difference smaller than that of the observed data. We conducted a 
565 
similar analysis for the results of our behavioral genetics experiments.  In that case we 
566 
bootstrapped subsamples (N=50) of our control dataset with replacement 10,000 times 
567 
and calculated the circular variance of each dataset.  As above, we then reported the 
568 
proportion of bootstrapped data sets with a smaller variance than each experimental 
569 
group.  We selected a resample size of 50 as this approximated the sample size of our 
570 
datasets (N=49, 54, 64).  A systematic analysis of p-values showed that they decreased 
571 
asymptotically to a constant level at resample sizes greater than 20.

Movie S1 
577 
E-PG activity correlates with azimuthal position of sun and stripe visual objects 
578 
under open-loop flight conditions. All panels are time-synchronized and sampled at 
579 
the two-photon volumetric imaging rate. Upper panel: Two-photon Ca2+ imaging in the 
580 
protocerebral bridge of a flying fruit fly. The fly is presented with sun and stripe stimuli 
581 
that move in azimuth at a constant speed (open loop). Upper 10% GCaMP6f 
582 
fluorescence (ΔF/F) in green, lower 90% ΔF/F in grey; Gaussian filtered. Middle panel: 
583 
wing tracking (red) in the machine vision camera view of the tethered fly. This ventral 
584 
view is flipped to represent the anatomical right wing on the right. Stimulus position 
585 
(blue) and E-PG neuron activity bump position (green) represented in azimuthal space 
586 
(not to scale). Lower panels: ΔF/F during 20 seconds of sun and 20 seconds of stripe 
587 
stimuli presentations. White vertical stripe indicates current frame. Azimuthal position 
588 
of E-PG activity bump (blue dots and probability distribution) and stimulus position 
589 
(computed as in (1), red) co-vary. Visual stimuli are only presented on the centered 
590 
216°-wide LED arena.
