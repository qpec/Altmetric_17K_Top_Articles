Composite resins for posterior tooth restorations have become a viable alternative to 
dental amalgam. Failures sometimes cannot be easily explained, and we hypothesize that 
a genetic component may influence longevity of restorations. We aimed to determine if 
there is any evidence for a difference in the performance of amalgams versus composite 
resin in extensive posterior restorations. We also aimed to determine if risk factors such 
as age, sex, smoking tobacco, alcohol drinking, diabetes status, and periodontal health 
status may have a role in the failures of extensive anterior composite restorations. Finally, 
we investigated if genetic variation in matrix metalloproteinases that are present in the 
mineralized dentin is associated with failure of composite resin. The data used to perform 
this research were obtained from the Dental Registry and DNA Repository project after 
screening 4,856 patients. All restorations were evaluated at times of 1, 2, and 5 years 
after the restoration placement. 6,266 amalgam and 2,010 composite restorations were 
analyzed in a total of 807 patients in a period of approximately 10 years (period corre-
sponding to the database existence). An additional 443 extensive direct composite resin 
restorations in anterior teeth were also studied. Failure rates of amalgam and composite 
restorations are similar, and by the end of 5 years, composites outperformed amalgams 
slightly. Failures of anterior composite restorations occurred more often in males who 
smoked tobacco (p = 0.05), despite a similar number of females and males that smoked 
tobacco in the sample (116 individuals smoked tobacco, 54 females and 62 males). 
Alcohol drinking increased failure rate within 2 years (p = 0.03). We found a statistically 
significant association between matrix metalloproteinase 2 rs9923304 and failure of 
composite restorations (p = 0.007). Composite resins can replace amalgam restorations. 
Smoking tobacco and drinking alcohol will increase the chance of restoration failure.

In 2008, Norway was the first country to completely ban amalgam dental restorations, quickly fol-
lowed by Sweden and Denmark. This decision was motivated by concerns related to the composition 
of the amalgam and the existence of viable non-mercury filling substitutes (composite resins for the 
most part). Currently, amalgam still has widespread use. Concerns regarding amalgam substitutes 
are related to their longevity in the mouth (1–4).

Nevertheless, dentists appear to favor using amalgam in more 
challenging cases (5). No empirical evidence exists that supports 
the assumption that dental amalgam restorations can lead to neu-
rotoxic and nephrotoxic effects in humans (6). When dental disease 
is taken into consideration, large composite restorations survive 
longer in individuals with low risk for disease in comparison with 
individuals with concomitant diseases. For high risk patients, 
amalgam shows better survival (7). Despite the evidence showing 
no health consequences for having dental amalgam restorations, 
the question persists regarding composites being able to provide 
the same performance of their metallic counterparts. Since we 
have a registry of dental clinical information linked to biological 
samples, we aimed to determine if there is any evidence for a dif-
ference in the performance of amalgams versus composite resin 
in extensive posterior restorations. We also aimed to determine if 
risk factors, such as age, sex, smoking tobacco, alcohol drinking, 
diabetes status, and periodontal health status, may have a role in 
the failures of extensive anterior composite restorations. Finally, 
we investigated if genetic variation in matrix metalloproteinases 
(MMPs) that are present in the mineralized dentin is associated 
with failure of composite resin. In this study, we show that com-
posite resins can fully substitute dental amalgams in routine dental 
practice with the likely benefit of not having any environmental 
consequences. In case of anterior complex direct composite resin 
restorations, we show that smoking tobacco and drinking alcohol 
will increase the chance of restoration failure. Finally, since dentin 
MMPs are exposed and activated during the process of restoring a 
tooth with composite resin, they degrade type I collagen (8–11), we 
tested if genetic variation in MMPs are associated with composite 
restoration failures and show that the matrix metalloproteinase 2 
(MMP2) may have a role in the failure of composite restorations.

The data studied here were obtained from the University of 
Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine Dental Registry and 
DNA Repository project. The primary role of the School of 
Dental Medicine is to educate dental health professionals and 
students depending on the patient’s commitment to complete 
necessary educational requirements. These patients are the ones 
that are invited to participate in the Dental Registry and DNA 
Repository project. Patients treated are, for the most part, from 
the great Pittsburgh area but the patient pool tends to be over-
represented by individuals with lower social economic status and 
hence higher risk for all oral and overall health issues. However, 
the population treated at the School of Dental Medicine and the 
individuals participating in the registry are a better represen-
tation of the ethnic distribution of individuals of Pittsburgh, 
which is comprised by approximately 65% Whites, 26% African 
Americans and the remaining a mix of Hispanics, Asians, and 
other groups. Starting in September of 2006, all individuals who 
sought treatment at the University of Pittsburgh School of Dental 
Medicine were invited to be part of the registry. These individu-
als gave written informed consent authorizing the extraction of 
information from their dental records and collection of a saliva 
sample. Saliva samples were stored for future studies and served 
as source of DNA. This project was approved by the University 
of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board (IRB # 0606091). This 
manuscript follows the STROBE guidelines for reporting obser-
vational studies.
For this study, 4,856 patient records that are part of our 
registry were screened. Figure 1 provides an overall picture 
of our study. In the first step, all restorations of posterior teeth

involving the occlusal and at least one proximal surface were 
evaluated and their status was determined at 1, 2, and 5 years 
after placement of the restorations. Data extracted included date 
of placement and date of the observed failure (as determined by 
a reevaluation of the case). Restorations lost at follow-up were 
not included in the analysis [2,054 (32.78%) amalgam and 781 
(38.85%) composite restorations]. 6,266 amalgam and 2,010 
direct composite resin restorations were analyzed in a total of 
807 patients (434 females, 373 males, mean age 42 years) in a 
period of approximately 10 years (period corresponding to the 
database existence) (Table 1). Restoration failure was defined 
as necessity of replacement due to fracture, discoloration in the 
case of composites, or development of secondary caries. The goal 
of this comparison was to determine if there are any differences 
in the rates of failure of these two types of restorations. Aside 
from standard non-parametric analysis (i.e., chi-square), we also 
performed a Kaplan–Meier survival probability estimate (12–14) 
using the VassarStats package (15) (Table 2, Figure 2). It was not 
possible to precise the month in which the restoration failed for 
all cases since patients not necessarily visited the dentist right 
away. Therefore, we decided to group the observations by three 
time ranges as described above.
In the second step, we selected patients that have at least 
one complex restoration of anterior teeth that involves four or 
more surfaces. From the registry records available, 412 patient 
records included an extensive anterior direct composite resin 
(210 females, mean age of 44.95 years, and 202 males, mean 
age of 46.37 years); however, we excluded 139 cases in which 
the restoration was not performed in our clinics and hence no 
baseline could be determined. A total of 443 direct composite 
restorations of anterior teeth were studied. Failed restorations

resUlTs
amalgam versus composite resin
From those 6,266 amalgam and 2,010 composite restorations, 
2,054 amalgam and 781 composite restorations could not be 
monitored, since the patients discontinued treatment. A total of 
612 amalgam (9.76%) and 198 composite (9.85%) restorations 
were considered failures in the period up to 1 year after the place-
ment of the restoration (p = 0.08), 134 amalgam (2.14%) and 58 
composite (2.88%) restorations between 1 and 2 years (p = 0.38), 
and 203 amalgam (3.24%) and 24 composite (1.19%) restorations 
within 2–5 years (p = 0.0000001). These figures show lower rates 
than those found in the literature (4) and show small differences 
between up to 5-year failure rates of amalgam in comparison to 
composite restorations. The differences in failure rates of 0.09% 
in favor of amalgam up to 1 year of follow-up, 0.74% in favor of 
were defined as described above. The goal of this second analysis 
was determining if risk factors, such as age, sex, smoking tobacco 
(116 individuals smoked tobacco, 54 females and 62 males), 
alcohol drinking (28 individuals drank alcohol, 7 females and 21 
males), diabetes status (34 individuals were diabetic, 11 females 
and 23 males), and periodontal health status (252 had a diagnosis 
of periodontitis, 112 females and 140 males) played a role in 
direct composite restorations of anterior teeth failures. We used 
chi-square and calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) comparing individuals who carried a certain risk 
factor compared to individuals without the risk factor.
In the last step, we studied the cases in which composite resin 
restorations failed; a total of 92 unrelated individuals who had a 
failed composite resin (either in the anterior or posterior teeth). 
For this part of the study, we tested the hypothesis that genetic 
variation in specific MMP genes is overrepresented in cases of 
failed composite resin restorations. For comparison, we selected 
from our registry 92 unrelated individuals (50 females, 42 males, 
mean age 41 years) matched by type of composite restoration 
(same tooth, same dental surfaces involved), age, sex, ethnicity, 
smoking tobacco, drinking alcohol, diabetes, and periodontal 
health. The rationale for this last experiment is that MMPs are 
exposed and activated by the acidic agents during adhesive 
bonding procedures prior to placement of direct composite resin 
restorations. Our overall hypothesis is that carrying specific 
MMP alleles increases degradation of the collagen fibrils at the 
resin–dentin-bonded interfaces, which leads to clinical failure of 
composite restorations.
We studied 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms in four genes 
(Table 3): MMP2 (rs9923304, rs2285053, rs243865, rs2287074, 
rs243847, rs11639960, rs2241145, rs243832), MMP3 (rs650108, 
rs520540, rs639752, rs679620, rs522616, rs520540), MMP8 
(rs3765620, rs17099443), and MMP9 (rs17576, rs2272766, 
rs13925, rs2236416). These genetic variants were selected due 
to their known functional activity, gene location, and allele 
frequency (16–19). Genotyping data for the 92 individuals 
selected as cases and 92 individuals used as comparison were 
commensurate with genotyping data obtained previously from 
distinct individuals from the Pittsburgh area drawn for studies 
of different phenotypes [formation of periapical lesion related 
to deep caries lesions in dentin (16); chronic periodontitis (18)] 
and we concluded these samples we selected were not under the 
influence of undetected population substructure.
Chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests, and OR with 95% CI 
calculations were used to determine Hardy–Weinberg equilib-
rium and statistically significant differences with an alpha of 
0.05. The PLINK software package (20) was used to analyze the 
distribution of alleles and genotypes between individuals with 
direct composite resins that failed versus controls that had the 
same restorations without any failures. To assure, we obtained 
a satisfactory matching for our case–control analysis, we used 
age, sex, ethnicity, smoking tobacco, drinking alcohol, diabetes, 
and periodontal health as covariates and performed both linear 
and logistic analyses and found that there were no differential 
influence of the covariates in the results. Therefore, we present 
here the results of the genotypic (two degrees of freedom) test as 
implemented in PLINK.

gelatinolytic activities of demineralized collagen matrices. 
Apparently, MMP2 and MMP9 are involved in the degrada-
tion process [reviewed by Liu et al. (22)]. We show for the first 
time that genetic variation potentially affecting degradation of 
collagen is associated with failures of more extensive composite 
restorations. MMP2 rs9923304 TT genotype frequency is 23% 
in Whites, 14% in Chinese and Japanese, and 1.8% in Yoruba 
Africans (according to the dbSNP: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
projects/SNP/snp_ref.cgi?rs=9923304) and could serve as the 
basis for a genomic approach to define risks for shorter longevity 
of extensive composite restorations and more frequent recalls 
of patients treated with direct composite resins. These results 
support the suggestion that patient-related factors rather than 
the restorative material are the most important determinants of 
secondary caries and restoration failures (23). It is remarkable 
that the association we found between MMP2 rs9923304 and 
failure of extensive composite restorations is evident with only 92 
cases. While concerned about multiple testing, we did not apply 
the strict Bonferroni correction as it would increase type II errors 
and a major focus of this study was to identify putative associa-
tions with having a failure composite resin for further studies. 
For example, under the Bonferroni correction, we would have 
lowered the alpha to 0.0025 (0.05/20) and the result of rs9923304 
(p = 0.007) would be considered not significant. We have demon-
strated before (24) that known true associations are missed when 
correction for multiple testing is implemented. It is also important 
to note that a larger discussion on the interpretation of p-values 
is currently underway and we should move to the near future to 
an interpretation that takes into account the biological relevance 
of an observation beyond the blind consideration of the arbitrary 
alpha threshold to determine significance (25). The results of our 
work should be considered with caution and serve to generate 
hypothesis to be directly tested in larger and more homogeneous 
samples. On the other hand, simply disregarding the nominal 
associations presented here may delay discovery by misleading 
the field to believe no true biological relationships exist. Whereas 
the p-value of 0.007 may not reach the strict Bonferroni threshold 
that would be applied to our analysis, the presence of four genetic 
variants in MMP2 with nominal associations at a 0.05 alpha level 
suggest a role for this gene in dentine degradation and composite 
resin failure. We also simplified our analyses (bivariate instead of 
multivariate) since we paired our sample by a number of covari-
ates and each individual included was not related to anyone else 
in the cohort.
Our data also show that direct composite resins perform 
similarly (and maybe slightly better) to amalgam in posterior 
teeth up to 5 years and are suitable substitutes for their metallic 
counterparts, making it feasible to completely replace amalgam in 
dentistry. The justification of using amalgam due to its lower costs 
alone in contrast to the potential of eliminating an environmental 
hazard has become harder to support now that direct composite 
resins can perform at acceptable levels. Our data come from a 
large clinic where dentists working are in the beginning of their 
professional careers. Also, the population treated has some of the 
worst oral health and overall health indicators in the country (26). 
The statistically significant lower failure rate of posterior compos-
ite resin versus amalgam restorations with 5 years follow-up in 
amalgam up to 2 years of follow-up, and 2.05% in favor of direct 
composite resins up to 5 years of follow-up appear to be rela-
tively small differences of one material over the other; however, 
the impact of a couple percent points may be substantial when 
costs are accounted for large population numbers. Kaplan–Meier 
survival probabilities estimates showed no differences in the 
survival of amalgam versus composite resin for extensive restora-
tions of posterior teeth (Table 2; Figure 2), and were done just 
to illustrate the initial findings. Since we have grouped subjects 
in three representative timeframes (1, 2, and 5 years), these data 
do not show survival by shorter intervals. It is worth noting that 
these restorations were performed by students (dentists in train-
ing). The less technique sensitive dental amalgam performance 
was similar to the technique sensitive composite resin in our 
student’s hands, which contradicts previous reports suggesting 
composite resins are 10 times more likely to fail when placed by 
dental students (21).
anterior complex composite resin 
restorations
A total of 253 individuals who had 443 direct composite resin 
restorations were studied. Among these individuals, males were 
more commonly affected by diabetes (p = 0.006) and periodon-
tal disease (p = 0.006) than females. From the total number of 
anterior complex restorations, 41 were considered failure (9%). 
Conversely, 268 restorations were considered satisfactory over 
a period of 6 months to 2 years, 78 during the period from 2 to 
4 years, and 56 over 4 years. The main reasons for restoration 
failure were secondary caries (N = 19), extraction due to reasons 
other than caries or fracture (N = 11), esthetic issues (N = 7), 
and fracture (N = 4). Failures occurred more often in males 
who smoked tobacco [p = 0.05; OR = 1.15 (95% CI 1.0–1.4)]. 
Failures were five times more common in the maxilla in patients 
who did not smoke tobacco; however, smoking tobacco changed 
the maxilla–mandible ratio to 1:1. Finally, alcohol drinking 
increased failure rate within 2 years [p = 0.03; OR = 4.4 (95% 
CI 1.2–16.1)].
genetic association between MMPs  
and Direct composite resin  
restoration Failures
All genotypes were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. The case–
control analyses showed a statistically significant association 
between MMP2 rs9923304 and failure of composite restorations 
(p = 0.007). The MMP2 rs2287074 (p = 0.01), rs243847 (p = 0.05), 
and rs2241145 (p = 0.01) variants also showed association 
with failure of composite restorations. One variant in MMP3 
(rs639752) had a p-value borderline of the nominal alpha of 0.05 
(p = 0.06). The distribution of all other genetic variants was not 
statistically and significantly different.

Pallesen U, et al. Longevity of posterior composite restorations: a 
our study, despite the fact that direct composite resins are more 
technique sensitive than amalgam, further suggest that the first 
can replace the latter. We also showed that smoking tobacco and 
alcohol drinking increase the chance of anterior extensive direct 
composite resin restoration failure. Based on these data, we argue 
that the mechanism underlying this result relates to the fact that 
smoking tobacco alters salivation (27), since we found that the 
higher failure rates of anterior maxillary restorations in the cases 
when individuals did not smoke equalized with anterior man-
dibular restoration failures when the patient smoked tobacco. 
Earlier reports from the literature do not suggest smoking nega-
tively impact the clinical performance of resin composite cervical 
restorations up to 1 year (28).
Matrix metalloproteinase 2, also known as gelatinase A, is 
a membrane-bound protein that is important for extracellular 
matrix turnover, preferentially cleaving collagen types IV, V, VII, 
and XI and gelatin (29). The MMP2 variant rs9923304 was found 
to be associated with formation of a periapical lesion when there 
is deep carious lesions in dentin (16). The underlying mechanism 
for this finding is possibly the same that explains the association 
of this genetic variant in MMP2 and failures of direct resin 
composite restorations of the present study. MMP2 gelatinolytic 
activity probably occurs both in partially demineralized dentin at 
the bottom of caries lesions and at the surface treated with either 
etch-and-rinse or self-etch adhesives. Overtime, this gelatinolytic 
activity weakens the bond between the material and the remain-
ing dentin structure leading to failure of the restoration. This 
result is compatible with the findings that showed significantly 
higher risk of failure of composite restorations in individuals with 
a higher number of restored surfaces (3).
Altered expression and activity levels of MMP2 is known to 
be associated with pathological states. For instance, in colorectal 
cancer, MMP2 mRNA is detected in higher levels in unaffected 
tissue surrounding metastatic tumors (30). Inactivating muta-
tions in MMP2 in humans lead to connective tissue underlying 
issues as seem in Torg–Winchester syndrome (31), multicentric 
osteolysis, arthritis syndrome (32), and possibly influence 
the formation of keloids (33). MMP2 encodes an enzyme that 
degrades type IV collagen. This role is particularly important 
in endometrial menstrual breakdown, vascular regulation, and 
inflammatory responses (34). In teeth, type IV collagen is located 
along the dental–enamel junction (35). Therefore, knowing the 
roles of MMP2 in other tissues and pathologies, we believe the 
mechanism underlying the genetic influence of MMP2 in failure 
of extensive composite resin restorations involves degradation of 
type IV collagen in individuals who have higher MMP2 activ-
ity for carrying particular genetic variants in the gene, which is 
located along of the dentin–enamel junction. Essentially, this 
would undermine the whole extension of the restoration right 
below its enamel margins, at the portions of dentin closest to 
enamel, a band approximately 5- to 10-µm wide (35). Although 
MMP2 rs9923304 may not have any function, it may be a sur-
rogate for individuals at higher risk for extensive composite resin 
restorations failure since it may be in linkage disequilibrium to 
genetic variants that alter MMP2 activity.
Since MMP activity has been associated with severity of 
chronic airway diseases (36), it would be interesting to investigate 
if patients with conditions such as idiopathic interstitial pneumo-
nia or bronchiectasis have a history of more often replacing direct 
composite resins or forming periapical lesions in comparison to 
individuals not affected by chronic airway diseases. Similarly, 
since MMP2 activity has been linked to poor prognosis of multi-
ple forms of cancer (37), including colorectal, melanoma, breast, 
lung, ovarian, and prostate, it would be interesting to interrogate 
if patients that more often have direct composite resin failures or 
develop periapical lesions, when affected by cancer, have a worse 
prognosis.
In summary, our studies of cases with extensive direct com-
posite resin restoration failures suggest that composite resins 
can fully substitute dental amalgams in routine dental practice. 
Smoking tobacco and alcohol drinking increase the chance of 
failure in anterior complex direct composite resin restorations. 
Finally, MMP2 may have a role in the cases that composite resto-
rations fail and genotyping rs9923304 may be useful to determine 
follow-ups of extensive direct composite resin restorations.
