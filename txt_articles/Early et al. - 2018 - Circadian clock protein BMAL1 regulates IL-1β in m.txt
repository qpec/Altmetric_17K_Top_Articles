A variety of innate immune responses and functions are de-
pendent on time of day, and many inflammatory conditions are
associated with dysfunctional molecular clocks within immune
cells. However, the functional importance of these innate immune
clocks has yet to be fully characterized. NRF2 plays a critical role in
the innate immune system, limiting inflammation via reactive
oxygen species (ROS) suppression and direct repression of the
proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1β and IL-6. Here we reveal that the
core molecular clock protein, BMAL1, controls the mRNA expres-
sion of Nrf2 via direct E-box binding to its promoter to regulate its
activity. Deletion of Bmal1 decreased the response of NRF2 to LPS
challenge, resulting in a blunted antioxidant response and reduced
synthesis of glutathione. ROS accumulation was increased in
Bmal1−/− macrophages, facilitating accumulation of the hypoxic
response protein, HIF-1α. Increased ROS and HIF-1α levels, as well
as decreased activity of NRF2 in cells lacking BMAL1, resulted in
increased production of the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1β. The
excessive prooxidant and proinflammatory phenotype of Bmal1−/−
macrophages was rescued by genetic and pharmacological activa-
tion of NRF2, or through addition of antioxidants. Our findings
uncover a clear role for the molecular clock in regulating NRF2 in
innate immune cells to control the inflammatory response. These
findings provide insights into the pathology of inflammatory con-
ditions, in which the molecular clock, oxidative stress, and IL-1β are
known to play a role.

L
ife on Earth follows a 24-h rhythm that is largely entrained by
daily oscillations in light, due to the earth’s axial rotation (1).
Cellular molecular clocks dictate variations in physiology and
behavior that peak and trough within this 24-h timescale, termed
circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythms generated by the molecu-
lar clock are maintained by autoregulatory transcriptional and
translational feedback loops. BMAL1 is the core orchestrator of
the molecular clock, and the only single clock gene deletion that
leads to complete ablation of all rhythms. BMAL1 forms a
heterodimeric partnership with CLOCK and binds to E-box sites
located across the genome, inducing rhythmic expression in
clock-controlled genes (1). Circadian rhythms are orchestrated
by the master clock, which resides in the suprachiasmatic nucleus
(SCN) of the hypothalamus. The SCN clock keeps peripheral
clocks in synchrony with the external environment (1). This
system provides circadian rhythms across a range of biological
processes, including hormone secretion (2), metabolism (1), and
immune function (1).
There is now a growing body of evidence that cells of the in-
nate immune system, such as macrophages, possess molecular
clocks (1). These endogenous clocks impose temporal gating
across a range of functions, including phagocytosis (3), cytokine
production (4), and antibacterial (5) and antiviral activity (6).
These daily oscillations in immune parameters are hypothesized
to prepare an organism for pathogenic threats, optimizing path-
ogen clearance and recovery. For example, mice have a height-
ened response to Listeria monocytogenes, lipopolysaccharide
(LPS), and induction of experimental autoimmune encephalo-
myelitis (EAE), a model of multiple sclerosis, ahead of their active
phase, which is exacerbated with Bmal1 deletion (5, 7–9). Bmal1 was
found to regulate inflammatory responses after Toll-like receptor 4
(TLR4) activation in macrophages by regulating the epigenetic state
of enhancers (10). Increased acetylation of lysine 27 of histone 3 was
increased globally with Bmal1 deletion, prolonging activation of
NF-κB target genes (10). Therefore, BMAL1 in the myeloid lineage
appears to be a potent regulator of the inflammatory state at the
cellular and organismal levels.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are signaling molecules that are
critical for the progression of an immune response (11). Evidence
exists of a role for BMAL1 in regulating ROS in multiple tissue
types. Global deletion of Bmal1 produces an advanced aging
phenotype, which is a result of increased oxidative stress (12).
Specific deletion of Bmal1 in the pancreas generates a diabetic
phenotype due to oxidative stress-induced death of β-cells (13).
Deletion of Bmal1 in the brain results in oxidative stress-induced
neurodegeneration and astrogliosis (14). Circadian rhythms in CD45+
leukocyte trafficking and migration are dictated by endogenous
rhythms in ROS levels, which stabilize HIF-1α (15). In mac-
rophages, ROS promote a proinflammatory response following
Significance
The molecular clock provides an anticipatory mechanism, allowing
organisms to prepare and respond to daily changes in the external
environment. The response of the innate immune system to
pathogenic threats is dependent on time of day; however, the
molecular mechanisms underlying this have yet to be fully un-
covered. We observe that the core molecular clock component,
BMAL1, is crucial in promoting an antioxidant response in myeloid
cells. Deletion of Bmal1 in macrophages disrupts NRF2 activity,
facilitating accumulation of reactive oxygen species and the
proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1β. Thus the molecular clock directly
controls NRF2 transcriptional activity and antioxidant capacity to
regulate IL-1β in myeloid cells.

 LPS-induced activation of TLR4, boosting production of the
cytokine IL-1β via stabilization of HIF-1α (16). IL-1β is a well-
established pyrogen, critical in producing symptoms of fever and
driving inflammation by inducing the expression of downstream
proinflammatory molecules, such as COX2 and nitric oxide (17),
and promoting cellular proliferation and differentiation of im-
mune cells (18). Intriguingly, IL-1β levels display time-of-day
variation in mice following L. monocytogenes infection (5) and
in the serum and joints of mice subjected to a model of rheu-
matoid arthritis (19).
Given the damaging potential of ROS, antioxidants are pro-
duced to inhibit the oxidation of biological molecules and bal-
ance the oxidative state of cells (20). NRF2 is a basic leucine
zipper (bZIP) transcription factor that plays a major role in
regulating the expression of antioxidant proteins, protecting cells
against oxidative damage triggered by ROS-induced injury or
inflammation (20). NRF2 is regulated by KEAP1, which se-
questers NRF2 to the cytoplasm, facilitating its degradation.
Oxidative stress promotes nuclear translocation of NRF2, facil-
itating binding to antioxidant response elements (AREs) in the
promoters of antioxidant genes, such as Hmox1, Gsr, and Nqo1
(20). NRF2 expression and activity has emerged as being under
the control of the molecular clock in lung tissue. The BMAL1:
CLOCK heterodimer was demonstrated to bind directly to E-box
sites within the Nrf2 promoter, inducing its expression (21).
NRF2 is expressed in macrophages and has been demonstrated
to inhibit IL-1β production via suppression of ROS and HIF-1α
(22). NRF2 has also been demonstrated to limit IL-6 and IL-1β
production through direct binding of NRF2 to promoter regu-
latory regions, preventing RNA Pol II recruitment (23). Whether
clock-mediated regulation of NRF2 and oxidative stress exists in
macrophages has yet to be examined. Circadian gating of
NRF2 in macrophages would provide a mechanism by which
BMAL1 may temporally regulate inflammation via modulation
of ROS levels (16) and direct binding of NRF2 to the IL-1β
promoter (23).
In this study, we establish that NRF2 levels and activity are
under circadian control in macrophages. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that the lack of NRF2 activity in Bmal1-deficient
macrophages results in higher ROS and an increase in the pro-
duction of the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1β. This provides a
mechanism by which the molecular clock may regulate aspects of
innate immunity, thus providing a potential mechanism for the
rhythmicity in pathology observed in inflammatory conditions,
including rheumatoid arthritis (19), osteoarthritis (24), asthma
(25), multiple sclerosis (8), and sepsis (7).
Results
BMAL1 Is a Direct Positive Regulator of NRF2 Transcription and
Activity. In vivo studies were performed on Bmal1LoxP/LoxP Lys-
MCre (Bmal1−/−) mice, in which Bmal1 is excised from cells of
the myeloid lineage, versus control Bmal1wt/wt Lys-MCre (Bmal1+/+)
mice. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were pre-
pared for in vitro studies. We compared unsynchronized wild-type
BMDMs to macrophages with a dysfunctional clock by genetic
deletion or knockdown of Bmal1. In certain experiments we syn-
chronized BMDMs in vitro to observe basal rhythms in these cells
and how they differed from Bmal1−/− BMDMs (26). Peritoneal
myeloid cells were also utilized in this study to directly measure
time-of-day differences.
To understand the impact of Bmal1 deletion on the LPS re-
sponse in macrophages, we performed an unbiased screening
approach of transcription factor activity, termed transcription
factor sequencing (TF-Seq) (27). The system utilizes lentiviral
reporter vectors, which contain the response element for a
transcription factor of interest. This response element was linked
to a Luc2p promoter to allow detection. Ultimately this allows
for unbiased measurement of the activity of numerous tran-
scription factors in a cell type of interest. Relative activity of the
NRF2
transcription
factor
was
significantly
decreased
in
Bmal1−/− macrophages following 1 (Fig. 1A) and 4 h (Fig. 1B) of
LPS stimulation. The NRF2 pathway was the only pathway in the
screen to be significantly altered with Bmal1 deletion (a full list
of assayed transcription factors can be found in SI Appendix,
Fig. S1).
To follow on from this result, we investigated the mechanisms
by which BMAL1 might regulate NRF2 in macrophages. We
performed an oligonucleotide pull-down experiment to demon-
strate that BMAL1 binds to an E-box sequence in the Nrf2
promoter in macrophages, and binding is prevented when this E-
box is mutated (Fig. 1C). We also performed an analysis of a
previously published ChIP-Seq dataset, monitoring BMAL1
binding to DNA in peritoneal macrophages (10). We found a
significant peak of BMAL1 binding to this same E-box in the
Nrf2 promoter in this dataset (SI Appendix, Fig. S2). Binding of
BMAL1 to this E-box in the Nrf2 promoter has previously been
described in lung (21) and pancreatic tissue (13).
We next examined whether time of day impacted the tran-
scription of Nrf2 in macrophages. Peritoneal cells were isolated
from mice every 4 h over a 24-h period and RNA was analyzed.
Zeitgeber time (ZT) is defined as the time in hours following the
onset of light in the animal facility. ZT0 corresponds to lights on,
whereas ZT12 refers to lights off. The expected rhythm in clock
gene expression was observed for Bmal1 (SI Appendix, Fig. S3A)
and a significant diurnal rhythm in Nrf2 expression was detected
(Fig. 1D). Given the approximate trough of Bmal1 and Nrf2 at
ZT8 and peak at ZT20, we extracted peritoneal cells from mice
injected with PBS or LPS at these times and measured
BMAL1 and NRF2 protein. In line with mRNA expression
levels, BMAL1 and NRF2 protein were higher at ZT20 relative
to ZT8 (SI Appendix, Fig. S3B). We next performed the serum
shock protocol (26) in control and Bmal1−/− BMDMs to rule out
any effects of light and/or cell extrinsic effect on the cycling of
Nrf2 mRNA. Bmal1+/+ and Bmal1−/− BMDMs were synchro-
nized with 50% horse serum and RNA was collected over a 36-h
period. We observed clear rhythms in the expression of Bmal1
(SI Appendix, Fig. S3C) and Nrf2 (Fig. 1E) in Bmal1+/+ BMDMs.
However, Nrf2 transcription was not rhythmic in Bmal1−/−
BMDMs and expression was constitutively lower (Fig. 1E).
We next examined the effects of LPS challenge on NRF2
expression in unsynchronized Bmal1−/− BMDMs and found that
both mRNA (Fig. 1F) and protein (Fig. 1G) were decreased in
response to LPS. Interestingly, basal levels of NRF2 were also
lower in Bmal1−/− BMDMs (Fig. 1G). To exclude the possibility
that deletion of Bmal1 was impacting the differentiation of
macrophages, we targeted Bmal1 by siRNA in fully differenti-
ated macrophages (SI Appendix, Fig. S4A). We observed de-
creased expression of Nrf2 mRNA (SI Appendix, Fig. S3D) and
protein (SI Appendix, Fig. S3E) in response to LPS stimulation
with siRNA knockdown of Bmal1. Thus, we demonstrate circa-
dian- and BMAL1-mediated regulation of NRF2.
NRF2 Antioxidant Pathway Is Down-Regulated upon Deletion of
Bmal1. NRF2 mediates the induction of a panel of antioxidant
genes that balance the oxidative state of the cell (20). Therefore,
we next examined the impact of BMAL1 on NRF2-mediated
antioxidant response genes. Knockdown of Nrf2 (SI Appendix,
Fig. S4B) was shown to decrease induction of three core
NRF2 target genes, Hmox1 (Fig. 2A), Gsr (Fig. 2B), and Nqo1
(Fig. 2C) in response to LPS. Hmox1 (Fig. 2D), Gsr (Fig. 2E),
and Nqo1 (Fig. 2F) expression levels were also decreased in
Bmal1−/− compared with Bmal1+/+ BMDMs following LPS
stimulation. Induction of Hmox1 (SI Appendix, Fig. S5A) and Gsr
(SI Appendix, Fig. S5B) were similarly decreased in Bmal1−/−
BMDMs following hydrogen peroxide stimulation. siRNA-
mediated knockdown of Bmal1 recapitulated the same effect

 on Hmox1 (SI Appendix, Fig. S5C), Gsr (SI Appendix, Fig. S5D),
and Nqo1 (SI Appendix, Fig. S5E) expression following LPS
stimulation. Reduced glutathione (GSH) synthesis is a down-
stream component of the NRF2-mediated antioxidant defense
pathway. Glutathione reductase, the product of Gsr, which we
determined was reduced with Bmal1 deletion, catalyzes the re-
duction of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to the sulfhydryl GSH
form (20). We found that total cell levels of GSH were decreased
in Bmal1−/− BMDMs versus Bmal1+/+ controls (Fig. 2G). These
results demonstrate that deletion or silencing of Bmal1 results in
the same suppression of the antioxidant response as direct si-
lencing of Nrf2, suggesting that BMAL1 activity in macrophages
during inflammation is mediated in part by NRF2.
Diurnal Variation in Oxidative Stress in Macrophages. The observed
diurnal rhythm of Nrf2 expression in peritoneal myeloid cells, in
which Nrf2 expression is high before the onset of morning
(ZT20) and low in the afternoon (ZT8/ZT12) (Fig. 1D), led us to
investigate whether ROS levels showed similar diurnal variabil-
ity. We discovered a significant increase in basal ROS levels in
peritoneal myeloid cells at ZT8 versus ZT20 (Fig. 3A), corre-
lating inversely with the diurnal rhythm in Bmal1 and Nrf2 ex-
pression. The diurnal pattern of reduced Nrf2 mRNA expression
and increased ROS production at ZT8 may explain our pre-
viously reported increase in LPS-induced lethality at ZT12 (7).
Therefore, we next investigated whether there was differential
expression in genes of the oxidative stress pathway. We discov-
ered an enrichment of genes involved in ROS production and
regulation at ZT12 versus ZT0 (Fig. 3B), providing further evi-
dence for a rhythm in ROS regulation in peritoneal myeloid
cells. A full list of genes analyzed can be found in SI Appendix,
Fig. S6. Given these results, we measured whole-cell ROS levels
in macrophages lacking Bmal1. A substantial increase in the levels
of ROS in Bmal1−/− BMDMs was detected both basally and with
the addition of LPS in comparison with Bmal1+/+ BMDMs
(Fig. 3C). This was further confirmed with siRNA-mediated

 knockdown of Bmal1 in wild-type BMDMs where increased ROS
was also observed (SI Appendix, Fig. S7). We were also able to
visualize this phenotype directly by utilizing fluorescent imaging
(Fig. 3D), which once again highlighted greater ROS production
with Bmal1 deletion.
Increased Production of IL-1β in Cells Lacking Bmal1. NRF2 and
ROS have been linked to regulation of IL-1β (16, 22, 23).
Therefore, we next investigated whether BMAL1-mediated
regulation of Nrf2 could impact IL-1β production. To test for
time-of-day variation in IL-1β production, we injected mice with
LPS at ZT8 or ZT20 and measured levels of IL-1β in serum (Fig.
4A). We found a significant increase in IL-1β induction at
ZT8 relative to ZT20, correlating with our previous results of
diurnal variation in ROS (Fig. 3A), BMAL1, and NRF2 levels
(SI Appendix, Fig. S3B). Furthermore, when myeloid Bmal1+/+
and myeloid Bmal1−/− mice were injected with LPS at ZT20, we
saw increased levels of IL-1β in the serum of myeloid Bmal1−/−
mice (Fig. 4B).
We next decided to investigate the effect of NRF2 on IL-1β
production in vitro. Knockdown of Nrf2 resulted in an increase in
IL-1β mRNA (Fig. 4C) and protein (Fig. 4D) following LPS
stimulation. A similar phenotype was seen with LPS treatment of
Bmal1−/− BMDMs, which revealed a boost in IL-1β mRNA (Fig.
4E) and protein (Fig. 4F) relative to Bmal1+/+ BMDMs. This
increased pro–IL-1β in cells lacking Bmal1 was also evident when
peritoneal cells were extracted from Bmal1+/+ or Bmal1−/− mice
and treated with LPS ex vivo (SI Appendix, Fig. S8A). We also
observed an increase in IL-6 secretion in Bmal1−/− BMDMs (SI
Appendix, Fig. S8B); however, TNFα levels remained unchanged

 (SI Appendix, Fig. S8C). This phenotype of IL-1β was confirmed
with siRNA-mediated knockdown of Bmal1 in wild-type BMDMs
at the RNA (SI Appendix, Fig. S8D) and protein (SI Appendix, Fig.
S8E) levels. HIF-1α is a hypoxic response protein that is activated
in response to increased ROS levels and directly binds to the IL-
1β promoter to induce its expression (28). We observed increased
HIF-1α accumulation following LPS stimulation in Bmal1−/−
BMDMs (Fig. 4G) and increased HIF-1α activity, as measured
indirectly by increased Phd3 expression, a target of HIF-1α (16)
(Fig. 4H).
Boosting NRF2 Activity and Limiting ROS Rescues the IL-1β Phenotype
of Bmal1-Deficient Macrophages. Our results demonstrate that de-
pletion of the NRF2 pathway in Bmal1−/− BMDMs results in a
prooxidant and proinflammatory phenotype. We performed knock-
down of Keap1 in macrophages to facilitate NRF2 accumulation.
Keap1 knockdown (SI Appendix, Fig. S4C) increased protein levels of
NRF2 in Bmal1−/− BMDMs (Fig. 5A). The increased accumulation
of NRF2 in Bmal1−/− BMDMs resulted in a decrease in HIF-1α
protein levels. Keap1 knockdown was demonstrated to recover
NRF2 activity in Bmal1−/− BMDMs as Nqo1 expression levels were
enhanced (SI Appendix, Fig. S9A). We anticipated that increased
NRF2 activity would rescue the proinflammatory phenotype of
Bmal1−/− BMDMs. Keap1 knockdown decreased the levels of Il1b
mRNA (Fig. 5B) and protein (Fig. 5C) in Bmal1−/− BMDMs. To
determine whether the reduction in IL-1β levels was due to direct
inhibition of Il1b expression by NRF2, or if ROS and HIF-1α
decrease, mediated by the antioxidant defense pathway, also
played a role, we treated Bmal1+/+ and Bmal1−/− BMDMs with
diethylmaleate (DEM) and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). DEM acti-
vates NRF2 through direct modification of KEAP1. NAC suppresses
ROS by increasing intracellular GSH levels. Treatment of Bmal1+/+
and Bmal1−/− BMDMs with DEM significantly enhanced expression
of Nqo1, validating enhanced activity of NRF2 with this compound (SI
Appendix, Fig. S9B). Treatment with both NAC and DEM decreased
IL-1β mRNA (Fig. 5D) and protein levels (Fig. 5E) in both Bmal1+/+
and Bmal1−/− BMDMs. A greater decrease in IL-1β was seen with
DEM treatment. This compound not only decreases ROS levels by

 activating NRF2, but would also increase levels of NRF2 binding
directly to the IL-1β promoter (23). By freeing NRF2 from regula-
tion of KEAP1 in Bmal1 knockout macrophages, we were able to
rescue the proinflammatory phenotype of these cells. Therefore,
these results confirm that deletion of Bmal1 facilitates increased
production of IL-1β due to suppression of NRF2 activity.
Discussion
The significant finding of this study is that BMAL1 regulates
oxidative stress pathways in macrophages to limit the production
of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β. We build upon previous
findings of circadian-mediated regulation of NRF2 (13, 21).
Specifically, we uncover that in macrophages the activity of
NRF2 over time of day and under LPS induction is directly
mediated by BMAL1. Furthermore, we have shown that re-
duction of NRF2 activity leads to a loss of redox homeostasis and
aberrant production of IL-1β, providing an explanation as to why
macrophages lacking BMAL1 are highly proinflammatory in
response to LPS. This mechanism may underlie the observed
time-of-day differences in LPS-induced lethality between mice
lacking myeloid Bmal1 versus controls (7).
Previous studies have determined the role of circadian
rhythms in modulating Nrf2 expression levels in various tissue
types (13, 21). However, the molecular clock does not regulate

 NRF2 in all tissues. The BMAL1:CLOCK heterodimer was
found to directly induce Nqo1 and Aldh2 in the cerebral cortex,
and not through the intermediate of NRF2 (14). In our study,
however, we observed clear binding of BMAL1 to the Nrf2
promoter, and 24-h rhythms in the expression of Nrf2 in myeloid
cells and macrophages were lost with Bmal1 deletion. We also
discovered that activity of NRF2 was decreased in Bmal1−/−
macrophages. Intriguingly, suppression of NRF2 activity has
previously been linked with pathogenesis of inflammatory con-
ditions that are at least partly mediated by both myeloid cells and
the circadian clock, such as EAE (29), sepsis (30), and asthma
(31). A surprising but intriguing outcome of our TF-Seq screen
was that the only significant pathway altered between macro-
phages lacking Bmal1 and controls was that of the NRF2 path-
way. This may have been due to having limited LPS timepoints
(1 and 4 h), and not an extended timecourse for pathway anal-
ysis. However, the fact that a significant decrease in NRF2 ac-
tivity was detected in Bmal1-deficient macrophages highlights
the importance of BMAL1 in its regulation.
The molecular clock has previously been associated with reg-
ulation of ROS in multiple tissues. Complete Bmal1 deletion has
been shown to induce an advanced aging phenotype via ROS-
induced tissue atrophy (12). Our results demonstrate an increase
in ROS when Nrf2 and Bmal1 mRNA expression and protein are
at their lowest point, and vice versa, in peritoneal myeloid cells.
This also correlates with increased levels of IL-1β in the serum of
mice upon LPS stimulation. However, Bmal1−/− mice produced
increased IL-1β when injected with LPS at ZT20 relative to wild-
type controls. This suggests that rhythms in Nrf2 may facilitate
rhythms in ROS production that impact IL-1β production in
vivo. This was further substantiated by an increase in the pro-
duction of ROS observed with Bmal1 deletion in BMDMs. ROS
are clearly linked with driving inflammation and tissue damage
(11). We have previously reported that BMAL1 expression in

 myeloid cells is crucial to providing mice with time-of-day pro-
tection from LPS at ZT0 relative to ZT12 in a mouse model of LPS
lethality (7). Here we discovered greater basal expression in genes
involved in ROS regulation at ZT12 relative to ZT0. For example,
Nox1, which forms a catalytic subunit of NADPH oxidase, a major
producer of ROS that is crucial to macrophage differentiation (32),
was significantly up-regulated at ZT12. Similarly, Nos2, an initiator
of nitric oxide production and a marker of proinflammatory mac-
rophage differentiation (33), was also increased. We hypothesize
that diurnal variation of ROS could be contributing to circadian
gating of LPS-induced endotoxic shock and that deletion of Bmal1
results in constitutively elevated ROS in macrophages.
NRF2 and oxidative stress are regulators of IL-1β. NRF2 has
been found to bind specific inhibitory sites in the promoter of
Il1b, suppressing its transcription, independently of ROS (23).
However, in later stages of macrophage activation with LPS,
ROS levels accumulate, stabilizing HIF-1α to drive IL-1β pro-
duction (16, 28). NRF2 has been demonstrated to limit IL-1β
through this mechanism (22). We discovered that Nrf2 silencing
leads to a clear boost in IL-1β production, which is phenocopied
when Bmal1 is silenced or deleted. We also show that HIF-1α
levels are significantly enhanced with deletion of Bmal1 follow-
ing LPS stimulation. Deletion of Bmal1 has previously been
demonstrated to lead to increased Hif1a mRNA in macrophages,
and ChIP-Seq revealed BMAL1 binding to the regulatory regions
of the Hif1α promoter (10). It is possible that we observe increased
HIF-1α with deletion of Bmal1 through a lack of BMAL1-mediated
suppression of Hif1α mRNA transcription, rather than through in-
creased oxidative stress-induced stabilization of the protein. How-
ever, Keap1 knockdown led to increased accumulation of NRF2,
boosted antioxidant response, and decreased HIF-1α in Bmal1
knockout macrophages. This resulted in decreased levels of IL-1β
being produced in Bmal1−/− BMDMs, indicating that oxidative
stress plays a key role in this pathway.
To understand whether the decreased IL-1β with Keap1 silencing
was due to the transcriptional repression of Il1b by NRF2, or sup-
pression of ROS, we utilized DEM to pharmacologically enhance
NRF2 activity, and NAC, to limit ROS independent of NRF2. Both
DEM and NAC decrease IL-1β in Bmal1−/− BMDMs. However,
there was greater inhibition of IL-1β with DEM than NAC. Our
findings suggest that this further decrease is possibly due to the dual
role of NRF2, as an antioxidant transcription factor and as a direct
transcriptional repressor of IL-1β (Fig. 6).
Rhythmic regulation of ROS and inflammatory mechanisms
by NRF2 activity could provide an explanation for circadian
rhythms exhibited in a variety of inflammatory processes and
diseases involving oxidative stress and IL-1β. The molecular
clock acts as a timed regulator of Nrf2 activity in mouse
macrophages, which has a large effect on the inflammatory output
of the cell through oxidative stress modulation. Given the impor-
tance of ROS in innate immunity, it is distinctly possible that many
aspects of the innate immune system mediated by oxidative stress
could be under circadian regulation. Recent reports have demon-
strated that HIF-1α levels regulated by circadian variation in ROS
dictates increased immune cell trafficking into tissues at ZT7 (15).
Ly6Chi monocytes show higher accumulation in tissues at ZT8 (5),
the time at which we showed increased ROS levels in myeloid cells
and enhanced IL-1β in serum. It is plausible that rhythms in immune
cell trafficking dictated by ROS could be maintained by rhythms in
Nrf2. Severity of circadian inflammatory conditions involving oxida-
tive stress and IL-1β, such as asthma (25), sepsis (7), rheumatoid
arthritis (19), osteoarthritis (24), and multiple sclerosis (8, 9), could
very well be mediated at the molecular level by this BMAL1:NRF2:
IL-1β axis. Further understanding of how the clock intersects with
NRF2 function and activity may reveal opportunities for chrono-
therapies in the treatment of circadian gated inflammatory disorders.
Experimental Procedures
Transgenic Animals. Mice with the gene Bmal1 containing LoxP sites were
provided by Christropher Bradfield. Bmal1LoxP/LoxP were crossed with Lyz2Cre,
which express Cre recombinase under the control of the Lyz2 promoter to
produce progeny that have Bmal1 excised in the myeloid lineage.
Bmal1LoxP/LoxPLyz2Cre (Bmal1−/−) mice where compared with control Lyz2Cre
(Bmal1+/+). Offspring were genotyped to confirm the presence of LoxP sites
and Cre recombinase.
All mice were maintained according to European Union regulations and
the Irish Health Products Regulatory Authority. Experiments were performed
under Health Products Regulatory Authority license with approval from the
Trinity College Dublin BioResources Ethics Committee.
In Vivo Studies. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with PBS or LPS (5 mg/kg)
at the relevant time of day. After 90 min, mice were humanely killed and
serum was isolated from whole blood and peritoneal cells were harvested.
Affinity Purification with Biotinylated Nucleotide (Oligo Pulldown). BMDMs
were seeded at 1 × 106 cells per milliliter and incubated overnight. Cells were
lysed in 100 μL of oligonucleotide buffer (25 mM Tris, 50 mM EDTA, 5%
glycerol, 5 mM NaF, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM DTT, 150 mM NaCl, and pro-
tease and phosphatase inhibitors). Samples were kept on ice and 4.5 mL of
oligonucleotide buffer without NaCl was added. A 50-μL sample was isolated
and the remainder was split between two tubes and incubated for 2 h with
streptavidin-agarose beads, which conjugated to the biotinylated promoter
regions (either WT E-box or mutant E-box). The lysates were centrifuged to
pellet the beads before addition of 50 μL of sample lysis buffer. Presence of
BMAL1 binding was detected by Western blot.
Transcription Factor Sequencing. Transcription factor sequencing was per-
formed as previously described by O’Connell et al. (27). TF-Seq lentiviral
vectors were transfected into HEK293T cells. After 48 h, the media con-
taining a pool of lentiviral particles, which represented the TF-Seq reporter
library, were transfected into Bmal1+/+ and Bmal1−/− BMDMs. After 72 h, the
BMDMs were replated into 96-well plates and left untreated or treated with
LPS for 1 or 4 h before assay collection and assessment of transcription factor
activity was carried out.
Quantification of Oxidative Stress Genes. RT2 Profiler Plates were used to
screen for differences in mouse oxidative stress pathways (PAMM-065ZC,
Qiagen) between peritoneal cells isolated at ZT0 and ZT12, based on SYBR
Green qPCR array. cDNA was generated from RNA samples using an RT2 First
Strand Kit (330401, Qiagen) and mixed with SYBR Green qPCR Mastermix

Schematic of proposed model. We observe that the core molecular
clock component, BMAL1, is crucial in promoting Nrf2 transcription in myeloid
cells. NRF2 can repress IL-1β through two possible mechanisms: direct re-
pression of Il1b transcription or induction of antioxidant response elements.
This second pathway results in ROS suppression, which reduces levels of HIF-1α
binding to hypoxia response elements (HRE), preventing induction of Il1b
transcription. Thus, the molecular clock directly controls NRF2 transcriptional
activity and antioxidant capacity to regulate IL-1β in myeloid cells.

 (330520, Qiagen) and distributed to RT2 Profiler plates which were pre-
loaded with primer sets for pathway relevant genes. Amplification was then
initiated in a real-time cycler and data were analyzed by the ΔΔCT method.
Ratios between ZT12 and ZT0 were plotted against the log2 mean average
expression values, which are based on ZT12 and ZT0 2^(–Avg(Delta(Ct))
values. The MA plot was generated using the statistical software R with the
packages ggplot2 and ggrepel (for labeling).
Statistical Analyses. Data were evaluated on Prism 5 or Stata 14 statistical
software (Stata Corp). Differences were compared by using analysis of var-
iance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s posttest analysis for comparison of
multiple independent groups or unpaired Student’s t test for direct analysis
of two independent groups. Circadian rhythms were detected and analyzed
using a cosinor regression model. Results are presented as mean ± SEM from
at least three independent experiments. Differences were considered sig-
nificant at the values of *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.001.
