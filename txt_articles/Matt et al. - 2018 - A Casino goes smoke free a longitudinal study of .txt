Methods 
Casino Locations Sampled 
The Appendix Figure 1 shows the casino schematics and the locations where 
measures were collected. 
Measures 
Air Particulate Matter. The following instruments were placed onto a wheeled cart 
which was moved around to sample different areas of the casino: Sidepak AM510 real-
time aerosol monitor (TSI, Inc., Shoreview, MN, USA), DustTrak DRX aerosol monitor 
(Model 8533, TSI, Inc., Shoreview, MN, USA), Condensation Particle Counter (CPC) 
(Model 3007, TSI, Inc., Shoreview, MN, USA), and HOBO U12 Temp/RH data logger 
(Onset, Bourne, MA, USA). The target sampling duration for each location was 
approximately 30 minutes. Both the Sidepak and DustTrak DRX were used to monitor 
PM2.5 mass concentrations, the CPC was used to monitor PM1 number concentrations 
(reported elsewhere), and the HOBO was used to record temperature and relative 
humidity. All data were measured in real-time and logged every 10-seconds. The mass 
concentrations for all PM measurements were reported in μg/m3.  
The reported mass concentrations of PM2.5 are the average of the values for 
Sidepak and DustTrak DRX data in the same time-frame. A calibration factor of 0.29 
(dimensionless) was used for the Sidepak when there was smoking activity.1-3, and a 
factor of 0.31 after the smoking ban.4 In addition, a humidity correction factor was 
applied to all PM2.5 data with simultaneous relative humidity (RH) over 45%.5 
Air nicotine. Air samples were collected overnight with a sorbent tube (SKC West 
226-93) connected to a sampling pump (SKC Airchek Model XR5000). Sampling time 
  
3 
ranged from 12-14 hours. Pumps were calibrated to 1.5 lpm before and after use, and 
samples for which pump flow rates changed by more than 10% were discarded. Our 
methods for samples handling and analysis have been previously described. 6 
Surface nicotine. Surfaces were sampled for nicotine through the method 
described in Quintana et al.7 Briefly, prescreened cotton rounds (100% organic cotton 
facial wipes) were wetted in 0.1% ascorbic acid, wiped inside rigid paper 10 x 10 cm 
templates taped into place, placed into glass vials with Teflon lids, stored in a cooler 
during transport, then stored in the laboratory at -20° C until analysis. Two different 
surfaces in each casino area were sampled for nicotine at each visit. One field blank (a 
cotton round handled in the casino but not wiped on a surface) was collected in the 
main smoking area, one in the nonsmoking slots area, and one in the Human 
Resources area.  
Dust. Floor dust samples were collected using the cyclone vacuum High-Volume-
Small Surface-Sampler (HVS4, CS3 Inc., Venice, FL). Samples were collected from a 3 
m2 area and if the collected dust content did not exceed 1/2 inch in the dust collection 
bottle, additional area as needed (Mean=5 m2). Dust samples were pre-weighed, sieved 
through a 150 µm mesh sieve to remove artifacts such as large debris and hair, and 
weighed again. Sieved dust samples were stored at -20° C until extraction. 
Laboratory Analysis. For surface nicotine analysis, deuterated nicotine (d4) was 
added as an internal standard because it can be distinguished from nicotine contained 
in the sample matrix, allowing for accurate quantitation and assessment of extraction 
efficiency. Nicotine-d4 as an internal standard (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, 
Tewksbury, MA) was spiked directly onto the surface wipe in an amber glass vial. 0.1% 
  
4 
Formic acid solution was added to the vial, and then the vial was vortexed. Addition of 
1M potassium hydroxide (KOH) was followed and the vial was vortexed again. 
Acetonitrile was added to the solution and the vial was placed in a shaker for 30 
minutes. The extract was transferred to a centrifuge tube containing a pouch of 
MgSO4/NaCl (UCT ENVIRO MgSO4/NaCL mylar pouch, UCT, Bristol, PA), then 
vortexed and centrifuged. Afterwards, 1 mL of each extract was transferred from each 
centrifuge tube into 2mL micro-centrifuge tubes containing UCT ENVIRO CLEAN 
150mg MgSO4/50mg CEC18. The 2mL micro-centrifuge tubes were then vortexed and 
centrifuged. In the last step, the clear part of each sample extract was transferred to a 
pre-labeled LC vial for LC/MS/MS analysis.  
For the air nicotine analysis, glass wool and beads in each air tube were 
transferred to a pre-cleaned centrifuge tube and the samples were prepared following 
the same steps used for the surface wipes. The preparation of dust samples for nicotine 
and TSNAs and the instrumental conditions of an Agilent 1200 series liquid 
chromatograph with Agilent 6460 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (LC/MS/MS) 
have been described elsewhere.8 
Finger nicotine was measured through collection of wipe samples of nonsmoking 
confederates before and after their 4-hour visit to casino. A baseline sample was 
obtained in a hotel room prior to the confederate leaving for the casino. The research 
assistant wiped the confederate’s dominant hand index finger with a pre-wetted cotton 
round as detailed for surface wipes in our companion paper.7 A second sample from the 
same finger was obtained after the visit to the casino. One field blank (i.e., a cotton 
round handled in the hotel room but not wiped on a finger) was collected for the pre-
  
5 
exposure and one for the post-exposure samples each evening. The finger wipe 
samples and field blanks were placed into glass vials with Teflon lids, stored in a cooler 
during transport, and stored in the laboratory at -20° C until analysis. 
Urinary cotinine. Cotinine is a major metabolite of nicotine and a sensitive and 
specific biomarker of SHS and THS exposure in nonsmokers.9-11 Confederates 
collected a urine sample in a casino hotel restroom immediately before and after 
spending 4 h on the casino floor, and at each urination through the night until 
approximately 11 am the following day. The number of post exposure samples varied 
from 2 to 6 (Median=4). Post-exposure samples were combined in equal amounts to 
yield a single post-exposure sample for cotinine analysis by highly sensitive LC-MS/MS 
previously described.6  
Urinary NNAL. 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) is a 
metabolite of the tobacco-specific carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-
butanone (NNK). In nonsmokers, urinary NNAL is a carcinogen biomarker of exposure 
to SHS or THS.12 13 Post-exposure urine samples were analyzed individually for NNAL 
using liquid chromatography – tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The lower limit 
of quantitation (LOQ) of the method is 0.25 pg/mL.

RESULTS 
Figures 2 and 3 show concentrations of PM 2.5 and dust TSNAs before, during, 
and after the smoking ban. 
Before the Smoking Ban: SHS and THS Pollution 
PM 2.5 concentration.  Measures taken at baseline across six public casino 
locations (A1-A6; see Figure 1) showed elevated levels similar to those reported by 
Klepeis et al. for the same casino (24-87 µg/m3)14 and in previous studies of other 
casinos where patrons actively smoked (e.g., Achutan et al.: 23-86 µg/m3)15. The 
median PM 2.5 level was 39 µg/m3 with an interquartile range of (IQR) of 63 µg/m3 
(Q1=5.2; Q3=68.4).  
Dust TSNAs concentration.  Baseline measures showed a similar pattern as dust 
nicotine with highly elevated median levels compared to previously examined smoking 
environments and more restricted variability across locations than we observed for 
surface nicotine. Figure 2 shows data for the sum of NNK NNN, NAT, and NAB 
concentrations. The median total TSNA concentration was 95 ng/g, approximately 5 to 8 
times higher, respectively, than found in homes of active smokers.8  The IQR was 66 
ng/g (Q1=81; Q3=147), about 70% of the median levels, indicating that dust TSNA 
concentrations were more evenly distributed across the casino than surface nicotine 
loadings. The total TSNA concentration in the nonpublic nonsmoking area A7 was 42 
ng/g (not shown in Figure 2), or 44% of the median levels found in the public 
nonsmoking casino areas.

During the Ban: Changes in THS Pollution 
In Figures 2 and 3, measures taken from W1 through M6 reflect the time period 
when smoking was prohibited in the casino. During this time, tobacco smoke specific 
markers found in the air, on surfaces, and in dust reflect the persistent THS reservoir 
that accumulated over 27 years when smoking was permitted. 
PM 2.5 concentration.  Figure 2 shows that the smoking ban was well 
implemented, achieving an immediate 94% decline from 39 µg/m3 to 2.3 µg/m3 in W1. 
Concentrations stayed at levels <5 µg/m3 from M1 to M6 before they rebounded to 22.4 
µg/m3 after smoking resumed in M12. Statistical tests comparing the geometric mean at 
baseline to each of the six measures taken during the smoking ban (Chi2(7)=72.0; 
p<0.001) revealed significant reductions at W1 through M6 (all p<0.001).  
Dust TSNA concentration. Similar to changes in dust nicotine, dust TSNAs 
showed no or small declines from high baseline levels during the earlier months of the 
smoking ban (see Figure 3). The total dust TSNA concentration remained at levels 
between 48 and 84 ng/g until 2 months into the smoking ban before declining to lower 
levels in M3 and M6 (13 ng/g and 22 ng/g). Statistical tests comparing the geometric 
mean at baseline to each of the six measures taken during the smoking ban (Chi2=34.4; 
p<0.001) revealed no significant reductions through M2 (p>0.15) followed by significant 
reductions in M3 and M6 (all p<0.001). Total TSNA concentrations in the nonpublic 
nonsmoking areas (A7, A10) declined to 27 ng/g during the first two months of the ban 
and reached levels below 9 ng/g at M3 and M6 (not shown in Figure 3).

After the Reversal of the Smoking Ban  
The smoking ban was reversed 11 months after its initiation, and the M12 
measures show an overall rebound in THS pollution levels.  
The median PM 2.5 level increased to 22.4 µg/m3 from levels below 3.5 µg/m3 
throughout the smoking ban (see Appendix Figure 2). Statistical tests showed that the 
M12 level was significantly higher than all measures during the smoking ban (all 
p<0.004).  It was, however, not significantly different from the baseline level before the 
smoking ban (p=0.12). 
Levels of TSNAs measured in dust increased at M12 to 42 ng/g from 23 ng/g six 
months earlier (see Appendix Figure 3). This M12 level was significantly higher than 
those at M6 (p=0.019) and M3 (p=0.006) and was not significantly different from any of 
the earlier measures during the ban and before the ban (all p>0.13). 
In the nonpublic nonsmoking areas (A7, A10; not shown in Figures 1 and 2), THS 
levels did not rebound at 12 months but remained at or near the lowest levels observed 
during the smoking ban (surface nicotine: 0.1 µg/m2; dust nicotine: 3.7 µg/g; dust NNK: 
1.9 ng/g; air nicotine: 0.05 µg/m3).
