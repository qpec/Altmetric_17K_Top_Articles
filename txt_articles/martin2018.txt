IMPORTANCE Prostate cancer screening remains controversial because potential mortality or
quality-of-life benefits may be outweighed by harms from overdetection and overtreatment.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of a single prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening
intervention and standardized diagnostic pathway on prostate cancer–specific mortality.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Cluster Randomized Trial of PSA Testing for
Prostate Cancer (CAP) included 419 582 men aged 50 to 69 years and was conducted at
573 primary care practices across the United Kingdom. Randomization and recruitment of
the practices occurred between 2001 and 2009; patient follow-up ended on March 31, 2016.
INTERVENTION An invitation to attend a PSA testing clinic and receive a single PSA test
vs standard (unscreened) practice.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome: prostate cancer–specific mortality
at a median follow-up of 10 years. Prespecified secondary outcomes: diagnostic cancer
stage and Gleason grade (range, 2-10; higher scores indicate a poorer prognosis) of prostate
cancers identified, all-cause mortality, and an instrumental variable analysis estimating
the causal effect of attending the PSA screening clinic.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among practices randomized to a single PSA screening
intervention vs standard practice without screening, there was no significant difference in
prostate cancer mortality after a median follow-up of 10 years but the detection of low-risk
prostate cancer cases increased. Although longer-term follow-up is under way, the findings
do not support single PSA testing for population-based screening.

 E
vidence from randomized clinical trials conducted in
Europe (the European Randomized Study of Screen-
ing for Prostate Cancer [ERSPC], N = 162 243)1 and
in the United States (the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and
Ovarian Cancer Screening [PLCO] trial, N = 76 693)2 has not
resolved the controversies surrounding prostate-specific
antigen (PSA)–based prostate cancer screening, resulting
in different recommendations worldwide.3,4 The prog-
nosis for low- and intermediate-risk localized prostate
cancer is excellent,5 and although there is fair-quality evi-
dence that screening by PSA testing reduces prostate cancer
deaths,6 debate continues about the trade-off between
the mortality benefit and risks of harm from overdetection
and overtreatment.2-4
Current UK policy does not advocate screening.7 The
2017 draft recommendations from the US Preventive Services
Task Force advocate individualized decision making for men
between the ages of 55 and 69 years after a discussion of risks
and harms with their physician.6 This latest guidance comes
amidst concerns about the quality of previous evidence,4
favorable modeling projections,8 new secondary analyses,8
greater absolute risk (but not rate) benefits with long-term
follow-up,9 the use of active surveillance to avoid radical
treatment unless cancer is progressing,10 and long-term data
on the effects of different treatment options for localized
prostate cancer.5,10
The PLCO and ERSPC trials undertook repeated PSA
testing at intervals of 1, 2, or 4 years.1,2 Less intensive strate-
gies, such as longer screening intervals or one-off screen-
ings, have been predicted to reduce overdetection, over-
treatment, and costs relative to more frequent screening.11,12
However, “opportunistic testing” may increase overdetec-
tion without reducing prostate cancer mortality.13
The Cluster Randomized Trial of PSA Testing for Pros-
tate Cancer (CAP) was designed to determine the effects of
a low-intensity, single invitation PSA test and standardized
diagnostic pathway on prostate cancer–specific and all-
cause mortality while minimizing overdetection and over-
treatment. The results from the median follow-up of 10
years are reported in this article.
Methods
The Derby National Research Ethics Service Committee East
Midlands (formerly the Trent Multi-Centre Research Ethics
Committee) provided approval for identifying mortality and
cancer incidence and review of patient medical records for
prostate cancer. Approval for the identification of men in
the control and intervention groups without individual con-
sent was obtained from the UK Patient Information Advi-
sory Group (now the Confidentiality Advisory Group) under
§251 of the National Health Service Act 2006.
Approval from the UK Patient Information Advisory
Group allowed review of the medical records for men who
died of a cause potentially related to prostate cancer before
consent could be obtained (provided the man did not record
an objection to his medical records being used for research).
Men who underwent PSA testing in the intervention group
gave individual informed consent. All clinical centers had
local research governance approval. The University of Bristol
acted as the study sponsor (the institution taking overall
responsibility). The trial protocol appears in Supplement 1.
Randomization
This was a primary care–based cluster randomized trial of an
invitation to a single PSA test followed by standardized pros-
tate biopsy in men with PSA levels of 3 ng/mL or greater.14
The Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT)
trial of treatments for localized prostate cancer was
embedded15 within the CAP trial (eFigure 1 in Supplement 2).
Between 2001 and 2009, 911 primary care practices geo-
graphically located near 8 hospital centers in England and
Wales were randomized to the intervention and control
groups prior to practice recruitment and obtaining consent.
Randomization was stratified within geographical groups
and block sizes of 10 to 12 neighboring practices using a com-
puterized random-number generator. Because randomiza-
tion preceded practices being invited to take part in the
study and because the invitation was tailored to the group
(intervention or control) to which the practice had been ran-
domized, it was not possible to conceal randomization while
practices decided whether to participate. Therefore, we
compared the characteristics of the practices that agreed to
participate (Table 1).
Participants
The inclusion criterion was all men aged 50 to 69 years in
each of the randomized primary care practices. The exclu-
sion criteria were a history of prostate cancer on or before
the randomization date and patient registration with the
practice on a temporary or emergency basis. Follow-up was
completed on March 31, 2016.
Intervention
In the intervention group, men aged 50 to 69 years received
a single invitation to a nurse-led clinic appointment. At the
Key Points
Question What is the effect of an invitation to a single
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening on prostate cancer
detection and median 10-year prostate cancer mortality?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial comparing men
aged 50 to 69 years undergoing a single PSA screening
(n = 189 386) vs controls not undergoing a PSA screening
(n = 219 439), the proportion of men diagnosed with prostate
cancer was higher in the intervention group (4.3%) than in the
control group (3.6%); however, there was no significant difference
in prostate cancer mortality (0.30 per 1000 person-years for the
intervention group vs 0.31 for the control group) after a median
follow-up of 10 years.
Meaning The single PSA screening intervention detected more
prostate cancer cases but had no significant effect on prostate
cancer mortality after a median follow-up of 10 years.

 appointment, men were provided with information about
PSA testing. After giving consent, men were offered the PSA
test. Men with PSA levels of 3.0 ng/mL or greater were
offered a standardized 10-core transrectal ultrasound–
guided biopsy. Those diagnosed with clinically localized
prostate cancer and who met the eligibility criteria were
recruited to participate in the ProtecT trial to receive treat-
ment. The ProtecT trial compared radical prostatectomy,
radical conformal radiotherapy with neoadjuvant androgen
deprivation therapy, and active monitoring.5 In contrast, the
control practices provided standard National Health Service
management, and information about PSA testing was pro-
vided only to men who requested it.16
Management of Cases and Data Collection
Cases of prostate cancer that were detected among men in
the intervention group who did not attend the nurse-led PSA
clinic appointment and among men in the control group
were managed by the same clinicians as those who attended
the PSA clinic in the intervention group. Men were linked to
the National Health Service Digital Organization and the
Office for National Statistics for deaths and cancer registra-
tions. There were only 639 men (0.15%) unable to be linked
or who were not registered. Prostate cancer stage and
Gleason grade at diagnosis were obtained from Public
Health England and Public Health Wales, and supplemented
with routine hospital data from the study centers. We were
unable to abstract good quality data on metastases from
routine records. Study data were collected using the REDCap
(Research Electronic Data Capture) electronic data capture
tool (a secure, web-based application designed to support
data capture for research studies) hosted at the University
of Bristol.
Primary and Secondary Outcome Measures
The outcome measures and methods for statistical analysis
were prespecified prior to data release in a published statis-
tical analysis plan17 (also appears in Supplement 1), which
was updated and finalized on July 26, 2016. The primary
outcome was definite, probable, or intervention-related
prostate cancer mortality at a median follow-up of 10 years
and was determined by an independent cause of death
evaluation committee that was blinded to trial group
assignment.18
The secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, pros-
tate cancer stage, and Gleason grade at prostate cancer diag-
nosis. Prostate cancer and all-cause mortality at 15 years,
health-related quality of life, and cost-effectiveness also
were prespecified secondary end points but are not
reported in this article.
Statistical Analysis
The primary analysis followed the intention-to-screen
principle, comparing outcomes among eligible men at pri-
mary care practices randomized to the intervention group
with outcomes for eligible men at primary care practices

 randomized to the control group.17 Kaplan-Meier plots were
used to display cumulative incidence of the primary and sec-
ondary outcomes. Estimated rate ratios (RRs) were used to
compare prostate cancer incidence and mortality in interven-
tion vs control practices using mixed-effects Poisson regres-
sion, which allows for clustering of men within primary care
practices and of neighboring primary care practices within
randomization strata.
Because the incidence of prostate cancer varies greatly by
age, each man’
s follow-up was divided into periods defined by
his age using a lexis diagram approach19 (≤59, 60-64, 65-69,
70-74 and ≥75 years; the youngest age stratum was larger to
compensate for fewer events). With a separate mean baseline
rate for each age group, the assumption of a constant base-
line rate applies to each group separately.
A prespecified secondary analysis was estimation (using
random allocation as an instrumental variable) of the effect
of the trial intervention in those accepting the PSA clinic invi-
tation and attending the clinic, using a generalized method of
moments estimator.17,20,21 Prespecified subgroup analyses
investigated the effects of PSA testing on prostate cancer–
specific mortality by baseline age group and socioeconomic
status using a likelihood ratio test for interaction.
Prespecified sensitivity analyses were (1) adjustment of
the primary analysis for baseline measures observed to differ
between the intervention and control groups (not required
because baseline measures did not differ between groups)
and (2) estimation of the intervention effect on the primary
outcome if all patients treated within the ProtecT trial had
undergone the treatment shown to be superior (not required
because no treatment was shown to be superior). In explor-
atory analyses, differences in the rates of prostate cancer
detection during the initial 18-month screening period, post-
screening period, and overall were estimated. In a further
exploratory analysis, we examined evidence that the prostate
cancer mortality rate ratio changed over time by testing for
nonproportional hazards using scaled Schoenfeld residuals
derived from Cox models.
Because there were few missing data, and in accordance
with our statistical analysis plan, we did not conduct mul-
tiple imputation analyses. All P values are 2-sided. In inter-
preting the results, we focused on estimated effects of the in-
tervention vs the control and the associated 95% CIs.22 Results
are described as statistically significant if the P value was <.05
or not statistically significant if the P value was ≥.05. All analy-
ses were conducted using Stata version 14.2 (StataCorp).
Power
The original power calculations were based on the estimated
10-year incidence of prostate cancer mortality using 1994
data for England and Wales, assuming a plausible between-
practice coefficient of variation of 0.2 (additional information
appears in the trial protocol in Supplement 1). Calculations
predicted that 209 000 men in each group would yield 1720
prostate cancer deaths during a median follow-up of 10 years,
and allow a prostate cancer mortality RR of 0.87 to be
detected with 80% power at a significance level of .05.
Assuming an uptake in PSA testing of between 35% and 50%,
this corresponds to RRs between 0.62 and 0.73 among men
actually undergoing PSA testing.
These RRs are similar to those assumed in the power cal-
culations for the ERSPC.23 Estimates of the effect on power of
ever undergoing PSA testing during follow-up in the control
group suggested that the effect would be minimal unless
reaching 20%.
Results
Study Population
There were 911 primary care practices randomized within 99
geographical areas. Of these, 126 were subsequently
excluded as ineligible (Figure 1).14 Consent rates among the
remaining eligible primary care practices in the intervention
group (n = 398) and the control group (n = 387) were 68%
(n = 271) and 78% (n = 302), respectively. There were 573 eli-
gible practices (73%) that agreed to participate and there
were 195 912 men eligible for the intervention group and
219 445 men eligible for the control group. Among these
415 357 randomized men (mean [SD] age, 59.0 [5.6] years),
there were 189 386 in the intervention group and 219 439 in
the control group after exclusions who were included in the
analysis (n = 408 825; 98%).
There are some differences between the numbers of par-
ticipants in the intervention group of this trial14 and the pub-
lished ProtecT trial study population5 (eTable 1 in Supplement
2). There were no important differences comparing measured
characteristics of practices that did vs did not agree to
participate.14 There were no important differences in mea-
sured baseline characteristics between intervention group vs
control group practices or men (Table 1), indicating that post-
randomization exclusions did not introduce detectable selec-
tion biases.
Adherence
Among 189 386 men in the intervention group, 75 707 (40%)
attended the PSA testing clinic, 67 313 (36%) had a blood
sample taken, and 64 436 had a valid PSA test result. Of these
64 436 men, 6857 (11%) had a PSA level between 3 ng/mL and
19.9 ng/mL (eligible for the ProtecT trial) of whom 5850
(85%) had a prostate biopsy. Men in the intervention group
who attended PSA testing clinics were sociodemographically
similar to those who did not attend the clinics.24 Cumulative
contamination (PSA testing in the control group) was indi-
rectly estimated at approximately 10% to 15% over 10 years,
which is based on previously reported diagnostic referral
rates and approximately 20% of follow-up being subsequent
to a PSA test undertaken for screening.25-27
Primary Analysis
After a median follow-up of 10 years, 549 men (0.30 per 1000
person-years) died of prostate cancer (including intervention-
related deaths) in the intervention group compared with 647
men (0.31 per 1000 person-years) in the control group
(Figure 2A) (rate difference, −0.013 per 1000 person-years
[95% CI, −0.047 to 0.022]; RR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.85 to 1.08];

 P = .50; Table 2) (P = .38 in the exploratory analysis for non-
proportional hazards).
Secondary Analyses
After a median follow-up of 10 years, the number of men
diagnosed with prostate cancer was higher in the interven-
tion group (n = 8054; 4.3%) than in the control group
(n = 7853; 3.6%) (Table 3) (RR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.14-1.25];
P < .001). The between-group difference for incidence rate
was 0.65 per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 0.52-0.78;
P < .001). The incidence rates were 4.45 per 1000 person-
years (95% CI, 4.36-4.55) in the intervention group and 3.80
per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 3.72-3.89) in the control
group (Figure 2B).
Compared with the control group, men in the interven-
tion group were younger at diagnosis of prostate cancer

 (−1.34 years; 95% CI, −1.59 to −1.10; P < .001). The proportion
of men with low-grade prostate cancer (Gleason grade of ≤6)
was 1.7% in the intervention group vs 1.1% in the control
group (between-group difference, 6.11 per 1000 men [95%
CI, 5.38 to 6.84]; P < .001); localized prostate cancer (stage T1
or T2), 2.6% vs 1.9%, respectively (between-group difference,
6.97 per 1000 men [95% CI, 6.05 to 7.89]; P < .001); high-
grade prostate cancer (Gleason grade of ≥8), 0.7% vs 0.7%
(between-group difference, −0.58 per 1000 men [95% CI,
−1.09 to −0.06]; P = .03); and advanced-stage cancer (stage
T4, N1, or M1), 0.5% vs 0.6% (between-group difference,
−0.91 per 1000 men [95% CI, −1.36 to −0.46], P < .001;
Table 3 and eFigure 2 and eFigure 3 in Supplement 2).
Thus, as a proportion of detected cancers, the prostate
cancer tumors in the intervention group were less likely to be
high grade (≤6 vs 7 vs ≥8; odds ratio, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.64-
0.73]; P < .001) or advanced stage (T1 or T2 vs T3 vs T4, N1, or
M1; odds ratio, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.62-0.75]; P < .001). The clini-
cal characteristics of prostate cancer tumors among men in
the intervention group who did not attend the PSA testing
clinic were not significantly different from men in the control
group (Table 3 and eFigure 4 and eFigure 5 in Supplement 2).
In the instrumental variable analysis for prostate cancer
mortality, the adherence-adjusted causal RR was 0.93 (95% CI,
0.67-1.29, P = .66; Table 2). This represents an increase of the
effect estimate compared with the intention-to-screen analy-
sis (relative reduction from 4% to 7%), but remains a small and
imprecisely estimated effect.
There were 25 459 deaths in the intervention group and
28 306 deaths in the control group. There was no significant
difference in the rates of all-cause mortality between these
groups (RR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.94-1.03], P = .49; Table 2 and
eFigure 6 in Supplement 2). Prostate cancer–specific mortal-
ity effect estimates were consistent when based on alterna-
tive definitions of prostate cancer mortality (eTable 2 in
Supplement 2).
Prespecified Subgroup Analyses
There were no significant differences in the effect of the
intervention on prostate cancer mortality according to age or
socioeconomic status (Table 4). There were 8 deaths in the
intervention group and 7 in the control group that were
related to diagnostic biopsy or prostate cancer treatment
(eTable 3 in Supplement 2).
Exploratory Analysis
After a median follow-up of 10 years, 4687 of 75 707 (6.2%)
men in the intervention group were diagnosed with prostate
cancer after attending the PSA testing clinic compared with
3367 of 113 679 (3.0%) men who did not attend the clinic
(Table 3). Among the 4687 incident cases of prostate cancer
among those who attended the PSA clinic, 4160 cases of
prostate cancer were found following a valid PSA test result,
of which 1172 (28%) were among men with a baseline PSA
level of less than 3 ng/mL (eTable 1 in Supplement 2). These
1172 initially PSA test–negative cases of prostate cancer were
diagnosed a mean of 7.9 years after randomization. Prostate
cancer detection was lower among men who did not attend

 the PSA clinic in the intervention group compared with men
in the control group (between-group difference, −6.17 per
1000 person-years [95% CI, −7.42 to −4.91], P < .001; eFigure
7A in Supplement 2).
During the first 18 months following recruitment (the
screening phase), the rate of prostate cancer detection was
10.42 per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 10.05 to 10.81) in the
intervention group compared with 2.18 per 1000 person-
years (95% CI, 2.02 to 2.34) in the control group (rate differ-
ence, 8.25 [95% CI, 7.83 to 8.66], P < .001; eTable 4 in
Supplement 2). In contrast, the rate of prostate cancer detec-
tion after the screening phase was 3.36 per 1000 person-
years (95% CI, 3.27 to 3.46) in the intervention group vs 4.11
per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 4.02 to 4.21) in the control
group (rate difference, −0.75 [95% CI, −0.61 to −0.88];
P < .001). When the analysis was restricted to men in the
intervention group who attended the PSA clinic vs men in
the control group, the rate of prostate cancer was 3.41 (95%
CI, 3.27 to 3.56) (rate difference, −0.70 per 1000 person-
years [95% CI, −0.87 to −0.53], P < .001; eFigure 7B in
Supplement 2).
The higher proportion of low-grade and early-stage pros-
tate cancer in the intervention group was related to large
between-group differences during the screening phase (eFig-
ure 2, eFigure 3, and eTable 4 in Supplement 2). In contrast,
the proportions of all categories of Gleason grade and TNM
stage prostate cancer diagnosed more than 18 months after
randomization were lower in the intervention group than in
the control group (eTable 4 in Supplement 2).
Among the 549 men in the intervention group who died
of prostate cancer, 188 (34%) had attended the PSA screening
clinic and 59 deaths occurred in men eligible for the ProtecT
trial. However, lethal cancer had not been identified by the
single PSA test screening in the majority (n = 129/188; 69%).
Of these 129 men, 42 had not undergone PSA testing at all, 15
eligible men had not received a prostate biopsy, 68 had a PSA
level of less than 3.0 ng/mL at screening (and therefore were
below the threshold for recommending biopsy), and 4 had a
benign prostate biopsy result (eTable 1 in Supplement 2).
Other causes of death were similarly distributed between the
trial groups (eTable 5 in Supplement 2).
Discussion
In this cluster randomized clinical trial among men aged 50
to 69 years, the low-intensity intervention consisting of a
single invitation to PSA screening compared with standard
(unscreened) practice had no significant effect on prostate
cancer–specific mortality after a median follow-up of 10
years, but did significantly increase the detection of early-
stage, low-grade prostate cancer.
This trial provides new evidence that complements
published trials such as ERSPC and PLCO1,2 (eTable 6 in
Supplement 2). First, recruitment was based on primary
care practice clusters, minimizing volunteer bias and lessen-
ing PSA testing contamination among controls25 compared
with trials that individually randomized men. The lower

 proportion of prostate cancer cases detected, and the
greater proportion of higher stage and Gleason grade pros-
tate cancer tumors detected among men in the control
group (compared with the ERSPC and PLCO trials), suggest
low background PSA testing rates during follow-up, which is
consistent with current UK policy.16
Second, diagnostic pathways were standardized, and men
in the intervention group with localized prostate cancer were
randomized into the ProtecT trial to determine the effective-
ness of treatment following screening.5,10 Because there was
little evidence of a difference in mortality between the Pro-
tecT trial groups after a median follow-up of 10 years,5 it is un-
likely that the randomization to the ProtecT trial within the
intervention group in the CAP trial had any effect on the pri-
mary mortality results in the CAP trial.
Third, screening was less intensive than in the ERSPC or
PLCO trials, aiming to reduce overdetection. The higher age,
Gleason grade, and cancer stage at diagnosis in the CAP trial’
s
intervention group compared with in the ERSPC and PLCO
trials reflect adherence to the low-intensity strategy.
Fourth, the CAP trial recruited patients during a more
recent PSA testing era between 2001 and 2009 compared
with between 1993 and 2003 in the ERSPC trial and 1993 and
2001 in the PLCO trial. Participants had access to similar
advances for treatments of all stages of prostate cancer, pro-
viding estimates of PSA screening effectiveness in the con-
text of contemporary management.
Fifth, all clinical centers followed the same screening and
diagnosis protocol, with high rates of biopsy among those with
an increased PSA level, and 10-core rather than sextant bi-
opsy to improve prostate cancer detection. Sixth, compared
with the ERSPC and PLCO trials, the CAP trial included a much
greater number of participants following a single randomiza-
tion and recruitment process, allowing for more precise esti-
mates of the effect of the intervention. In addition, the CAP
trial’
s design enabled the follow-up of all men in the source
population for key outcomes.
It has been hypothesized that screening men in their early
50s may be more effective than at a later age29; however,
we did not find statistical evidence to support this (Table 4).
Recent reports suggest that evidence from trials about
screening effectiveness should consider the intensity of
testing.13,30 A between-center analysis of the ERSPC trial sug-
gested that more intensive screening reduces mortality rela-
tive to no screening, but also that intensive screening strate-
gies detect higher numbers of low-risk prostate cancer cases
and have a strong positive correlation between the extent of
the benefits gained and the harms caused.30 The results of the
CAP trial show that even a low-intensity strategy aiming to re-
duce overdetection leads to an increased detection of low-
risk prostate cancer cases, without benefit in reducing mor-
tality from the disease (Table 3 and eTable 4 in Supplement 2).
Determining the rate of overdetection in screening is
critical but challenging because it is influenced by the target
population, screening protocol, clinical and demographic fac-
tors, and the nature of the long lead time for developing pros-
tate cancer.31 There is little consensus about the methods for
determining overdetection and estimates range between 2%
and 67%.32 The CAP trial provides a low-intensity benchmark
against which other screening strategies can be compared in
lifetime models of overdetection, overtreatment, and screen-
ing cost-effectiveness.
This trial also identified the underdetection of lethal can-
cer in initial screening and among nonresponders (eTable 1 in
Supplement 2). Even though this may be related in part to the
low-intensity intervention, it raises the question of whether
underdetection of clinically important cancer also occurs with
more intensive screening strategies in other trials, but has not
been evident in trials lacking comprehensive follow-up and
identification of the target population.
The diagnostic pathway for prostate cancer detection is
changing, with advances in imaging (eg, multiparametric mag-
netic resonance imaging) being introduced with prostate bi-
opsy to improve the identification and targeting of clinically
important cancer,33 and blood-based biomarkers to enhance
the specificity of the serum PSA test, including genetic
testing.34 A PSA test alone with transrectal ultrasound–
guidedbiopsymaynolongerbethestandardofcareintheearly
detection of prostate cancer. Furthermore, offering multipa-
rametric magnetic resonance imaging or novel biomarkers to
men based on PSA thresholds will still miss cases of poten-
tially lethal cancer.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, the single PSA
screening may fail to reflect the long-term effect of multiple
PSA testing rounds seen in the ERSPC and PLCO trials. Never-
theless, we observed both a Gleason grade and cancer stage
shift, and a reduction in long-term prostate cancer incidence
following a single screening round. In PLCO35 and ERSPC
centers,36,37 tumors identified during second and subsequent
screening rounds were more likely to be localized, small vol-
ume, and with favorable histological grading compared with
those found during the first round of screening, supporting
model-based estimates that suggest overdetection increases
with repeated screening.37
Second, an important number of incident and lethal
prostate cancer cases were not identified through the initial
screening intervention (eg, among men with an initial PSA
level <3 ng/mL or among men in the intervention group who
did not attend the PSA screening clinic; eTable 1 in Supple-
ment 2), suggesting the inadequacy of conventional PSA
testing followed by transrectal ultrasound–guided biopsy.
These prostate cancer cases were clinically comparable with
those in the control group, suggesting similar routes to diag-
nosis. The single PSA testing protocol followed by 10-core
transrectal ultrasound–guided biopsy in this trial may have
led to the underdetection of some lethal cases. Prebiopsy
multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging may improve
this pathway in the future.33 However, initial screening also
did not identify many higher Gleason grade or advanced
stage cases, even in this population with little background
testing (Table 3), which was also noted in the Swedish center
of ERSPC.38
Third, in this trial there was 40% adherence with the in-
tervention. This compares with 59% to 69% in ERSPC centers

 using consent obtained after randomization; however,
adherence was higher in ERSPC centers with consent ob-
tained prior to randomization.39 Consistent with the primary
analysis, the instrumental variable analysis found no evi-
dence that attending the PSA screening clinic reduced pros-
tate cancer mortality. Men in the intervention group who at-
tended the PSA screening clinic were sociodemographically
similar to men who did not attend,24 although the measures
were somewhat crude, and nonattendees had lower rates of
incident prostate cancer than controls. Therefore, men not en-
tering the trial might be less likely to subsequently seek a PSA
test. The similarity of non–prostate cancer–related deaths be-
tween the intervention group and the control group indicates
the success of randomization (eTable 5 in Supplement 2).
Fourth, a median follow-up of 10 years may be too short
to identify the effect of screening. More than half the deaths
due to prostate cancer in the intervention group occurred
during the first 7 years after randomization, a period during
which it is unlikely that PSA screening would have an effect
(Figure 2A). Although the cumulative incidence of prostate
cancer mortality in the intervention and control groups
appeared to diverge after 12 years of follow-up, only 71/1196
of the prostate cancer deaths occurred after 12 years and an
exploratory analysis found no significant change in the rate
ratio over time. In the embedded ProtecT trial, prostate
cancer–specific mortality was approximately 1% after a
median follow-up of 10 years, with no evidence of a differ-
ence between randomized groups.5
However, the rate of metastatic disease was reduced by
2.4 per 1000 person-years with surgery and by 3.0 per 1000
person-years with radiotherapy vs by 6.3 per 1000 person-
years with active monitoring. Given the very low disease-
specific mortality at 10 years and the long lead time for the
development of prostate cancer (approximately 12 years in
the United Kingdom31), extended follow-up of the CAP trial is
crucial to ascertain whether the evidence of increased detec-
tion from the screening intervention coupled with treatment-
related effects on the occurrence of metastases translate into
longer-term survival benefits. After a median follow-up of
12.7 years, the Prostate Intervention vs Observation Trial
(PIVOT) reported little evidence of a difference in disease-
specific or all-cause mortality, but showed intermediate-risk
disease may benefit from early intervention.40 Nevertheless,
there was no significant effect of the CAP trial intervention
on the prespecified primary outcome of prostate cancer mor-
tality at a median follow-up of 10 years.
Fifth, while postrandomization exclusions have the
potential to lead to bias (Figure 1), there were no differences
between excluded practices in the intervention group and
the control group for key variables such as primary care prac-
tice size, Index of Multiple Deprivation, or urban vs rural
location.14 Furthermore, the cumulative incidence of all-
cause mortality was similar in both the intervention and con-
trol groups. Therefore, it seems unlikely that the postran-
domization exclusions biased our results.
Conclusions
Among practices randomized to a single PSA screening inter-
vention vs standard practice without screening, there was no
significant difference in prostate cancer mortality after a me-
dian follow-up of 10 years but the detection of low-risk pros-
tate cancer cases increased. Although longer-term follow-up
is under way, the findings do not support single PSA testing
for population-based screening.
