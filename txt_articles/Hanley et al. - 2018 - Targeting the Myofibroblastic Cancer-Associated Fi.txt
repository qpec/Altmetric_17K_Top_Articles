Abstract
Background: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are tumor-promoting and correlate with poor survival in many cancers,
which has led to their emergence as potential therapeutic targets. However, effective methods to manipulate these cells
clinically have yet to be developed.
Methods: CAF accumulation and prognostic significance in head and neck cancer (oral, n ¼ 260; oropharyngeal, n ¼ 271), and
colorectal cancer (n ¼ 56) was analyzed using immunohistochemistry. Mechanisms regulating fibroblast-to-myofibroblast
transdifferentiation were investigated in vitro using RNA interference/pharmacological inhibitors followed by polymerase
chain reaction (PCR), immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, and functional assays. RNA sequencing/bioinformatics and
immunohistochemistry were used to analyze NAD(P)H Oxidase-4 (NOX4) expression in different human tumors. NOX4’s role
in CAF-mediated tumor progression was assessed in vitro, using CAFs from multiple tissues in Transwell and organotypic
culture assays, and in vivo, using xenograft (n ¼ 9–15 per group) and isograft (n ¼ 6 per group) tumor models. All statistical
tests were two-sided.
Results: Patients with moderate/high levels of myofibroblastic-CAF had a statistically significant decrease in cancer-specific
survival rates in each cancer type analyzed (hazard ratios [HRs] ¼ 1.69–7.25, 95% confidence intervals [CIs] ¼ 1.11 to 31.30,
log-rank P � .01). Fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation was dependent on a delayed phase of intracellular reactive
oxygen species, generated by NOX4, across different anatomical sites and differentiation stimuli. A statistically significant
upregulation of NOX4 expression was found in multiple human cancers (P < .001), strongly correlating with myofibroblastic-
CAFs (r ¼ 0.65–0.91, adjusted P < .001). Genetic/pharmacological inhibition of NOX4 was found to revert the myofibroblastic-
CAF phenotype ex vivo (54.3% decrease in a-smooth muscle actin [a-SMA], 95% CI ¼ 10.6% to 80.9%, P ¼ .009), prevent
myofibroblastic-CAF accumulation in vivo (53.2%–79.0% decrease in a-SMA across different models, P � .02) and slow tumor
growth (30.6%–64.0% decrease across different models, P � .04).
Conclusions: These data suggest that pharmacological inhibition of NOX4 may have broad applicability for stromal targeting
across cancer types.

Article
 Over recent years, research has highlighted the contribution of
the microenvironment to tumor progression (1), and numerous
studies have documented the tumor-promoting role of cancer-
associated fibroblasts (CAFs) (2–5). However, these cells remain
poorly characterized, and clinically effective treatments target-
ing CAFs are yet to be developed. This, in part, is due to CAF het-
erogeneity, which possibly reflects their cell(s) of origin, the
tissue in which they develop, and their activation state (6). As a
result of this heterogeneity, a single CAF marker is yet to be
identified, although several have been proposed in different
studies, including a-smooth muscle actin (SMA) (5), fibroblast
activation protein-a (FAP) (4), podoplanin (7), and platelet-
derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-a (8).
Despite this diversity, CAF are most commonly defined by
acquisition of an a-SMA-positive, “activated” myofibroblast
phenotype (5). Myofibroblasts share the phenotypic traits of
fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells, secreting extracellular ma-
trix (ECM) and generating mechanical tension within tissue
through cell contraction (9,10). Myofibroblasts play a key transi-
ent role in wound healing but persist in pathological fibrosis
and cancer (11), where they contribute to multiple “hallmarks of
malignancy”
(4,5,12,13).
These
tumor-promoting
properties
have led to myofibroblastic CAFs emerging as potential thera-
peutic targets (14). However, because of a limited understanding
of the mechanisms regulating CAF accumulation, effective mo-
lecular targeting of this cell population has not yet been
achieved.
Previously we have described the tumor-promoting effects
of a-SMA-positive myofibroblastic CAF and shown that tumors
rich in these cells are associated with poor survival (5,13). The
principal aim of this study was to identify a common mechan-
ism regulating differentiation of myofibroblastic CAFs across
cancer types in order to develop a strategy to therapeutically
target these cells.
Methods
Human Tissue Sample Procurement
Archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) material was
used to construct tissue microarrays (TMAs) from previously
described cohorts of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC), esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), and early-stage
colorectal cancer (CRC) patients (5,12,15,16), composed of tripli-
cate
1 mm
cores
from
randomly
selected
tumor
regions
(MiniCore 3, Alphelys - Plaisir, France). Ethical approval was
obtained through the UK National Research Ethics Service
(NRES; Rec Nos. 10/H0504/32 and 09/H0504/66), and informed
consent was obtained from each patient. All tissue collection
and storage was handled by a human tissue authority (HTA)–
licensed tissue bank.
Immunohisto/Cytochemistry Staining and Scoring/
Quantification
TMAs or whole tissue sections were stained using the auto-
mated, commercially available visualization systems Envision
FLEX (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), Dako PT Link (Dako), and
Autostainer Link48 (Dako). All antibodies used were optimized
to national diagnostic standards (NEQAS). TMAs stained for
a-SMA were evaluated using a semiquantitative scoring system
described previously (5). Further details can be found in the
Supplementary Materials (available online).
Cell Culture and Reagents
Please see the Supplementary Materials (available online) for
details of cell culture conditions and reagents.
Mouse Models
Mouse experiments were conducted in accordance with the eth-
ical standards outlined in national and international guidelines.
All experimental protocols were approved by the authors’ insti-
tutional review board (University of Southampton) and by the
British Home Office.
Subcutaneous xenograft tumors composed of 5PT cells and
human fetal foreskin fibroblasts (HFFF2s) were grown in RAG1�/�
mice (n ¼ 14–15/group for shRNA experiments and n ¼ 9–10/group
for oral gavage experiments). Subcutaneous isograft tumors com-
prised of TC1 cells and murine lung fibroblasts (MLFs) were grown
in C57/BL6 mice (n ¼ 6/group). Please see the Supplementary
Materials (available online) for further details.
RNA Sequencing and Bioinformatics
Please see the Supplementary Materials (available online) for
details of RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis of patient survival rates was carried out with
death from cancer as the primary end point; survival time was
measured from the date of diagnosis in the HNSCC cohorts and
date of surgery in the CRC cohort. Other causes of death were cen-
sored at the time of death. Kaplan-Meier plots (with log-rank
[Mantel-Cox] tests) and unadjusted Cox proportional hazards mod-
els were used to describe the risk of dying from cancer. The propor-
tional hazards assumption was verified by visual assessment of
log-minus-log plots and ensuring no statistically significant trend
between ranked survival time and Schoenfeld residuals.
Statistical analysis of in vitro and in vivo experiments was car-
ried out on a minimum of three independent experiments or bio-
logical replicates. These data are presented as individual points
and summarized by mean þ/� 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in
all figures. The appropriate use of parametric vs nonparametric
tests was determined using the D’Agostino and Pearson omnibus
normality test, and where sample sizes were too small for this
test, a normal distribution was assumed. In cases where statistic-
ally significant differences in variance were found between groups
or when normalization resulted in 0 variance in one group (eg, in
cases where direct statistical comparisons are made with the con-
trol sample), Welch’s correction was applied to the calculated P
value. Statistical tests were carried out using either GraphPad
Prism v. 6, R, or IBM SPSS Statistics v. 22. In each case, these are
described in the “Methods” section and figure legends. All statis-
tical tests were two-sided, and P values of less than .05 were con-
sidered statistically significant.
Detailed methods for all other experiments can be found in
the Supplementary Materials (available online).

(n ¼ 56)
were
immunostained for a-SMA and analyzed as described previously
(baseline patient characteristics are shown in Table 1) (5,13). In
each patient cohort, moderate/high levels of stromal a-SMA
identified patients with statistically significantly increased
disease-specific mortality (all log-rank P � .01; HNSCC [oral]:
HR ¼ 3.13, 95% CI ¼ 2.07 to 4.74, P < .001; HNSCC [oropharyn-
geal]: HR ¼ 1.69 , 95% CI ¼ 1.11 to 2.57, P ¼ .01; CRC: HR ¼ 7.25,
95% CI ¼ 1.68 to 31.30, P ¼ .008) (Figure 1A; Supplementary
Figure 1A, available online).
Investigating the Fibroblast-to-Myofibroblast
Transdifferentiation Mechanism In Vitro
Numerous cell types potentially contribute to myofibroblastic
CAF accumulation in cancer, but most commonly they are
thought to originate from TGF-b-dependent transdifferentiation
of local fibroblasts (2–23). In vitro analyses showed that activa-
tion of canonical TGF-b signaling in human fibroblasts (SMAD
phosphorylation
and
target
gene
transcription
[SERPINE1])
occurred rapidly following TGF-b treatment (15 minutes and one
hour, respectively) (Figure 1B; Supplementary Figure 1B, avail-
able online), with the full myofibroblast phenotype emerging
after 48 to 72 hours (a-SMA upregulation and stress fiber forma-
tion) (Figure 1, B and E; Supplementary Figure 1, B and C, avail-
able online). Myofibroblast transdifferentiation corresponded
temporally with a delayed phase of intracellular reactive oxygen
species (ROS) production, maximal between 48 and 72 hours
post-TGF-b treatment (shown by increased DCFH-DA fluores-
cence and upregulation of the antioxidant response protein
Nrf2 [NFE2L2]) (Figure 1, B and C; Supplementary Figure 1D,
available online). Similarly, a delayed phase of intracellular ROS
production was observed following other stimuli that promote
myofibroblast
transdifferentiation
(ionizing
radiation
[IR])
(Supplementary Figure 1G, available online) (24,25).
We found that ROS generation was required for myofibro-
blast transdifferentiation because the process was suppressed
by N-acetyl cysteine (NAC; an anti-oxidant) following TGF-b and
IR treatment (Figure 1, D and E; Supplementary Figure 1, E, F,
and H, available online). To minimize off-target effects on TGF-b
signaling, NAC was also administered 24 hours post-TGF-b
treatment,
which
similarly
prevented
transdifferentiation
(Figure 1, D and E), whereas administering an Alk5 inhibitor
(TGF-bRI inhibitor) at this point had no effect (Supplementary
Figure 1I, available online). Thus the delayed ROS phase is crit-
ical for myofibroblast transdifferentiation, independent of sus-
tained canonical TGF-b signaling.
The flavoenzyme inhibitor diphenylene iodonium (DPI) pro-
duced a similar effect to NAC (Supplementary Figure 1J, available
online), suggesting that the delayed ROS phase was generated
enzymatically. We performed RNA sequencing on fibroblasts
treated with TGF-b to assess transcriptomic changes during myo-
fibroblast transdifferentiation. Using this data set, the expression
of genes within the gene ontology term “oxidoreductase activity”
(GO:0016491) was interrogated, showing statistically significant
upregulation of NOX4 (false discovery rate, adj. P < .001) (Figure
2A). Quantitative (Q-) PCR analysis confirmed persistent upregula-
tion of NOX4 mRNA after approximately five hours of TGF-b treat-
ment (Figure 2B), and immunoblotting showed that increased
NOX4 protein expression corresponded temporally with ROS gen-
eration (Supplementary Figure 2A, available online). NOX4 upregu-
lation also occurred during myofibroblast transdifferentiation of
adult primary fibroblasts isolated from normal oral, skin, and
colon tissue biopsies (Supplementary Figure 2, B–C, available on-
line). Pharmacological inhibition of NOX4 (GKT137831) (27) and
RNAi-mediated knockdown (shRNA and siRNA) (Supplementary
Figure 2, F and G, respectively, available online) abrogated TGF-b-
dependent ROS production, myofibroblast transdifferentiation
(Figure 2, C–G; Supplementary Figure 2, D–J, available online), and
cancer cell migration toward conditioned media from treated
fibroblasts (Figure 2H; Supplementary Figure 2K, available online).
NOX4 was also upregulated by alternative myofibroblast
transdifferentiation stimuli (IR), and inhibiting NOX4 similarly
suppressed ROS generation and myofibroblast transdifferentia-
tion in this context (Supplementary Figure 2, L–N, available on-
line). These data suggested that NOX4 is responsible for the
delayed
ROS
phase,
which
is
critical
for
fibroblast-to-
myofibroblast transdifferentiation.

Accumulation in Multiple Solid Tumors

 Cancer Genome Atlas [TCGA]). A statistically significant upregu-
lation of NOX4 in patient-matched tumor samples compared
with normal samples was found in HNSCC, EAC, and colon
adenocarcinoma (COAD) (Figure 3A), and similar upregulation
was also found in breast carcinoma (BRCA) and lung adenocar-
cinoma (LUAD; paired two-sided t test P < .001 for all). To ex-
plore NOX4 gene associations, we performed weighted gene

(28).
A
consensus
network was generated from HNSCC, EAC, and COAD primary
tumor samples, identifying 12 modules of highly co-expressed
genes conserved between the different tumor types. Four of the
modules were associated with stromal biological processes:
ECM organization, immune response, lymphocyte activation,
and vasculature development (adj. P < .001) (Figure 3B and
Table 2). A gene signature for TGF-b-activated fibroblasts (myo-
fibroblasts) was derived from the most statistically significantly

 upregulated genes in TGF-b-treated HFFF2s, identified by RNA
sequencing (Mellone_TGF_UR) (Supplementary Table 1, avail-
able online) (24); the distribution of these genes within the net-
work was then summarized by the first principal component.
Within the consensus network, NOX4 expression positively cor-
related with those modules relating to stromal processes, and
correlated most strongly with the ECM organization module
(Table 2). A highly statistically significant positive correlation
was found between NOX4 and eigengenes for the ECM module
and TGF-b-activated/myofibroblast gene signature in each indi-
vidual tumor type (Pearson’s r > 0.8, adj. P < .001 in both cases)
(Figure 3, C–E). Furthermore, NOX4 expression was strongly cor-
related to each of the genes identified as specific markers of
CAFs by Tirosh et al. (29) using single-cell RNA sequencing (FAP,
THY1, DCN, COL1A1/2, and COL6A1/2/3; NOX4 correlation meta
values ¼ 25.7–32.7 for the consensus network and r ¼ 0.64–0.86
for individual networks).
The data indicated that NOX4 is primarily expressed by myo-
fibroblastic CAFs in tumors. Immunohistochemistry staining
confirmed that NOX4 and a-SMA were similarly found in stro-
mal regions of HNSCC, EAC, and COAD tissue samples (Figure
3F). Stromal upregulation of NOX4 was also found in data sets
of laser microdissected stroma from EAC, LUAD, and BRCA (P <
.05) (Supplementary Figure 3, A–C, available online) and was
statistically significantly upregulated in patient-matched CAFs
relative to normal fibroblasts cultured ex vivo from esophageal
tissue biopsies (Figure 4A; Supplementary Figure 4A, available
online).
To examine a possible causative association between NOX4
expression and myofibroblast transdifferentiation in tumors,
we used linear regression analysis. The presence of TGF-b-acti-
vated fibroblasts/myofibroblasts or CAFs was measured using
principal component analysis (PCA) to summarize the expres-
sion of two independent gene expression profiling data sets
from TGF-b-treated fibroblasts (from our own data and (30)) and
a
previously
described
CAF
gene
expression
signature
(Supplementary Table 1, available online) (31). This showed that
the level of NOX4 expression accounted for a statistically sig-
nificant proportion of the variability of these gene signatures in
HNSCC, EAC, COAD, rectal adenocarcinoma (READ), invasive
breast cancer, LUAD, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDAC) (r ¼ 0.65–0.91, r2 ¼ 0.418–0.833, adj. P < .001) (Table 3;
Supplementary Figure 3, D–F available online).
Testing NOX4’s Potential as a Therapeutic Target
Our results suggested that inhibiting NOX4 may have potential
for targeting the myofibroblastic CAF phenotype therapeutic-
ally. To test this, CAFs were isolated from human tumors
(HNSCC, EAC, CRC, and non–small cell lung cancer [NSCLC]) and
treated with GKT137831 or shRNA to inhibit NOX4. This sup-
pressed intracellular ROS production and a-SMA expression,
suggesting reversion to a more fibroblast-like phenotype (54.3%,
95% CI ¼ 10.6% to 80.9%, decrease in a-SMA, P < .01) (Figure 4, B–
D;
Supplementary
Figure
4,
B
and
C,
available
online).
Consistent with this, NOX4 inhibition also abrogated CAF-
dependent tumor cell migration/invasion in Transwell and
organotypic culture assays (Figure 4, E and F; Supplementary
Figure 4D, available online).
HNSCC
(5PT)
cells
promote
fibroblast-to-myofibroblast
transdifferentiation in HFFF2s in vitro (Supplementary Figure 4,
E–G, available online), which is suppressed by NOX4 inhibition
(Supplementary Figure 4G, available online). The 5PT/HFFF2
interaction in vivo, within a xenograft tumor model grown in
partially immune-compromised (RAG1�/�) mice, also generates
an a-SMA-positive myofibroblastic stroma (Figure 4I and 4L) and
promotes tumor growth (Supplementary Figure 4H, available
online). Using this model, we tested the efficacy of inhibiting
NOX4 for preventing myofibroblastic CAF accumulation and
tumor progression. Co-injection of HFFF2s transduced with
shRNA targeting NOX4 and 5PT cells caused a statistically sig-
nificant reduction in myofibroblast accumulation (53.2%, 95%
CI ¼ 24.1% to 82.2%, P ¼ .01) and tumor growth (37.6%, 95%
CI ¼ 6.0% to 69.2%, P ¼ .02) (Figure 4, G–I). A similar effect was
observed by targeting NOX4 pharmacologically; RAG1�/� mice
were inoculated with 5PTþHFFF2 xenograft tumors, which were
allowed to establish for four days. These mice were then treated
with GKT137831 (30 mg/kg by oral gavage), which statistically
significantly reduced myofibroblast accumulation (68.4%, 95%
CI ¼ 14.6% to 122.3%, P ¼ .02) and tumor growth (46.8%, 95%
CI ¼ 15.9% to 77.8%, P ¼ .006) (Figure 4, J–L; Supplementary
Figure 4, H and I, available online). GKT137831 treatment had no
statistically significant effect on tumor growth in the absence of
co-injected fibroblasts, suggesting that this compound predom-
inantly
acts
through
stromal
targeting
in
this
model
(Supplementary Figure 4H, available online).
In vivo experiments were also performed using an isograft
model (lung tumor model [TC1] þ murine lung fibroblasts
[MLFs] grown in C57/BL6 mice). To generate a myofibroblastic
stroma, MLFs were treated with TGF-b in vitro prior to injection
(Supplementary Figure 5A, available online). Similar to the
xenograft model, NOX4 inhibition (shRNA) (Supplementary
Figure 5, B–E, available online) and GKT137831 (Supplementary
Figure 5, F–H, available online) statistically significantly reduced
myofibroblast accumulation (79.0%, 95% CI ¼ 66.0% to 92.0%,
and 76.3%, 95% CI ¼ 54.1% to 98.6%, respectively, P < .001) and
tumor growth (64.0%, 95% CI ¼ 30.9% to 97.1%, and 30.6%, 95%
CI ¼ 1.9% to 59.3%, respectively, P � .04).
Discussion
The heterogeneous CAF population remains poorly defined;
however, our data show that across several human tumor types,
the presence of an a-SMA-positive stroma identifies patients
with poor survival (5,13,18). Targeting this CAF phenotype is
therefore an attractive therapeutic option, and in this study, we

mulation in many human cancers that can be targeted pharma-
cologically

differentiation and slow tumor growth.
Tumor cells have been shown to induce TGF-b 1-dependent
upregulation of NOX4 in breast stromal cells in vitro (32); how-
ever, to date, investigation of the role of NOX4 in cancer has pre-
dominantly focused on the tumor cell, where a variety of
functional effects have been described (33–37). In this study, we
show in multiple tumors that NOX4 expression correlates
strongly with myofibroblastic CAF accumulation. We found that
NOX4 regulates fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation
by generating a delayed phase of intracellular ROS, independent
of sustained canonical TGF-b signaling. This mechanism is
common to fibroblasts derived from different anatomical sites
and across different transdifferentiation-promoting stimuli.
Furthermore, we show that NOX4 inhibition in CAFs can abro-
gate the tumor-promoting function of these cells in vitro and
in vivo and that this effect can be achieved pharmacologically
(using GKT137831), identifying this enzyme as a druggable
therapeutic target. Consistent with our findings, NOX4 has been
shown
to
play
a
role
in
TGF-b-dependent
fibroblast-to-
myofibroblast transdifferentiation in several normal tissues
(27,38–40), and its inhibition has been shown to attenuate pul-
monary and liver fibrosis in preclinical mouse models (27,38,41).
CAFs are becoming increasingly recognized as potential
therapeutic targets because of their multifaceted role in tumor
progression, and it is hypothesized that their genetic stability
makes them vulnerable to targeted therapies (14,42). It remains
to be determined, however, how best to do this and in what con-
text because CAF targeting, even if successful, is unlikely to be
effective as single-agent therapy. While TGF-b signaling is
known to promote myofibroblast differentiation, targeting this
pathway in cancer is problematic because it also regulates
tumor-suppressive functions, and ubiquitous inhibition has
been shown to result in the development of cutaneous keratoa-
canthomas/squamous cell carcinomas (43,44). Recent clinical
trials have highlighted several drugs that improve response to
chemotherapy while also (inadvertently) appearing to target the
tumor stroma. For example, albumin-bound (nab)-paclitaxel
(designed for effective drug delivery of highly lipophilic agents)
has been shown to lead to CAF reduction and stromal disrup-
tion in PDAC, increasing the efficacy of gemcitabine and
improving patient survival rates (45,46). Similarly, the broad
tyrosine kinase inhibitor nintedanib (anti-VEGFR, -FGFR, -
PDGFR), developed as an angiogenesis inhibitor, increases
responses to docetaxel in non–small cell lung cancer patients
(47) and has also shown some efficacy in the treatment of idio-
pathic pulmonary fibrosis (48).
Treatments designed to specifically target CAFs, however,
have not been successful clinically. Inhibition of hedgehog sig-
nalling and depletion of FAP-positive CAFs have been shown to
enhance chemotherapy delivery (49) and antitumor immunity
(4) in murine models. However, both strategies have produced
disappointing results in phase II clinical trials for treatment of
metastatic pancreatic and colorectal cancers, respectively (50–
52). These poor clinical results are potentially explained by re-
cent studies that showed that stromal depletion in murine
PDAC models can lead to reduced survival (53–55) and that de-
pletion of FAP-positive cells results in cachexia and anemia due
to loss of bone marrow–derived stem cells (56,57). Oxidative
stress

(58,59). However, the use of various anti-oxidants to target these
effects clinically has proven similarly unsuccessful (60–62) and
has even been shown to increase the risk of metastatic spread
in a murine melanoma model (63).
Our data suggest that NOX4 inhibition represents a specific
method to abrogate the generation of intracellular ROS in fibro-
blasts, a critical step in myofibroblast differentiation/CAF accu-
mulation. Notably, we found that NOX4 inhibition also can
revert a-SMA-positive CAF to a more fibroblast-like cell, suggest-
ing that the CAF phenotype is potentially reversible and not
fixed in a terminally differentiated state. The xenograft and iso-
graft subcutaneous tumor models used in this study develop a
myofibroblastic and collagenous stroma with similar structural
properties to human tumors (18,24); we found that this can be
suppressed pharmacologically using GKT137831, a small or-
ganic molecule of the pyrazolopyridine dione chemical class,
which is a selective inhibitor of NOX1/4 and the first drug in this
class of NOX inhibitors to enter the clinic. A recent phase II clin-
ical trial examining its potential for inhibiting renal fibrosis in
patients
with
diabetic
nephropathy
demonstrated
pharmacological effectiveness and an excellent safety profile
(NCT02010242). Potential use in cancer has not been considered,
but may be considerable.
There are some limitations that must be considered when
interpreting these findings; the analysis of myofibroblastic CAF
association with survival was carried out using retrospective
cohorts, excluding patients lost to follow-up or with insufficient
archival material for analysis. These criteria may have intro-
duced some level of bias within the cohort if these groups were
characteristically different than those included. In addition, we
have only examined the potential for NOX4 inhibition in the
context of single-agent therapy, showing that this reduces myo-
fibroblast accumulation and tumor growth. To translate these
findings clinically, additional work is required to determine the
best approach for combining NOX4 inhibition with other types
of therapy, examining the effect of these treatments on tumor
progression in more detail (for example, effect on metastatic
spread),
and
using
spontaneous/orthotopic
murine
model
systems.
In summary, our data suggest that NOX4 inhibition may
have broad applicability for stromal targeting across cancer

ing resistance to chemotherapy (64,65) and adaptive antitumor

may be a useful adjunct to improve response to current chemo-
