IMPORTANCE Antithrombotic medications are among the most commonly prescribed
medications.
OBJECTIVE To characterize rates of hematuria-related complications among patients taking
antithrombotic medications.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Population-based, retrospective cohort study including
all citizens in Ontario, Canada, aged 66 years and older between 2002 and 2014. The final
follow-up date was December 31, 2014.
EXPOSURES Receipt of an oral anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Hematuria-related complications, defined as emergency
department visit, hospitalization, or a urologic procedure to investigate or manage
gross hematuria.
RESULTS Among 2 518 064 patients, 808 897 (mean [SD] age, 72.1 [6.8] years; 428 531
[53%] women) received at least 1 prescription for an antithrombotic agent over the study
period. Over a median follow-up of 7.3 years, the rates of hematuria-related complications
were 123.95 events per 1000 person-years among patients actively exposed to
antithrombotic agents vs 80.17 events per 1000 person-years among patients not exposed to
these drugs (difference, 43.8; 95% CI, 43.0-44.6; P < .001, and incidence rate ratio [IRR],
1.44; 95% CI, 1.42-1.46). The rates of complications among exposed vs unexposed patients
(80.17 events/1000 person-years) were 105.78 for urologic procedures (difference, 33.5;
95% CI, 32.8-34.3; P < .001, and IRR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.36-1.39), 11.12 for hospitalizations
(difference, 5.7; 95% CI, 5.5-5.9; P < .001, and IRR, 2.03; 95% CI, 2.00-2.06), and 7.05 for
emergency department visits (difference, 4.5; 95% CI, 4.3-4.7; P < .001, and IRR, 2.80; 95%
CI, 2.74-2.86). Compared with patients who were unexposed to thrombotic agents, the rates
of hematuria-related complications were 191.61 events per 1000 person-years (difference,
117.3; 95% CI, 112.8-121.8) for those exposed to both an anticoagulant and antiplatelet agent
(IRR, 10.48; 95% CI, 8.16-13.45), 140.92 (difference, 57.7; 95% CI, 56.9-58.4) for those
exposed to anticoagulants (IRR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.52-1.59), and 110.72 (difference, 26.5; 95% CI,
25.9-27.0) for those exposed to antiplatelet agents (IRR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.29-1.33). Patients
exposed to antithrombotic agents, compared with patients not exposed to these drugs, were
more likely to be diagnosed as having bladder cancer within 6 months (0.70% vs 0.38%;
odds ratio, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.79-1.92).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among older adults in Ontario, Canada, use of antithrombotic
medications, compared with nonuse of these medications, was significantly associated with
higher rates of hematuria-related complications (including emergency department visits,
hospitalizations, and urologic procedures to manage gross hematuria).

 A
ntithrombotic agents are among the most com-
monly prescribed medications for older adults in
North America.1 Oral anticoagulants are indicated for
primary and secondary prevention of stroke and systemic em-
bolism, as well as treatment of venous thromboembolism.2
Antiplatelet agents are indicated for primary and secondary
prevention of cardiovascular disease.3 Despite proven ben-
efits, antithrombotic agents are among the medications
most commonly associated with adverse events4 and have
contributed to nearly half of all adverse drug events.5 Fur-
ther, the rates of these adverse events are increasing.4 To date,
published randomized clinical trials and observational stud-
ies of antithrombotic agents have focused on intracranial
hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, and all-cause bleed-
ing as adverse events.6,7
To our knowledge, a complication that has not been
examined as the primary outcome in patients treated with
antithrombotic agents is hematuria. While hematuria repre-
sents a less life-threatening adverse event than intracranial or
gastrointestinal bleeding, it is common and involves diagnos-
tic evaluation including abdominal imaging and invasive
testing8,9 and management. The prevalence, severity, and
risk factors for hematuria associated with the use of anti-
thrombotic agents are largely unknown. To better character-
ize this association, this analysis examined rates of gross
hematuria-related complications including hospitalization,
emergency department visits, and urologic interventions
over a 13-year period among patients who received antico-
agulant or antiplatelet therapy from a population-based
cohort of adults aged 66 years or older in Ontario, Canada.
Methods
We conducted a population-based, retrospective cohort study
of patients aged 66 years or older in Ontario, Canada, between
April 2002 and December 2014 using data from the Institute
of Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES). In Ontario, medical care
is reimbursed by a single, government-operated health insur-
ance system (Ontario Health Insurance Plan). The cost of pre-
scription medications is covered for all patients starting at age
65 years through the Ontario Drug Benefit.
This study was designed and conducted according to
the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies
in Epidemiology guidelines10 and Reporting of Studies Con-
ducted Using Observational Routinely-Collected Health Data
Statement.11 The Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre Re-
search Ethics Board approved this study. Individual informed
consent was waived owing to the anonymous, aggregated na-
ture of the data.
Study Patients
We identified all residents of Ontario born before 1936, who
would be aged 66 years or older during the study interval
(2002-2014), based on date of birth using unique identifiers
(ICES key number). The index date was defined as each per-
son’
s 66th birthday. To include only those patients actively re-
ceiving medical care in Ontario during the study interval, we
excluded individuals who died and those who emigrated prior
to the index date. We further excluded patients diagnosed as
having a cancer (other than nonmelanomatous skin cancer)
prior to the index date and those with prior endoscopic uro-
logic procedures as these are likely to significantly affect a pa-
tient’
s likelihood of hematuria-related complications. We also
excluded patients older than the age of 105 years.
From linked databases, we collected demographic
information including patient age at the time of each pre-
scription, geographic location (local health integration
networks12), sex, geographically derived socioeconomic sta-
tus, rurality, and general comorbidity (Johns Hopkins aggre-
gate disease group13). The Johns Hopkins aggregate disease
group has better discrimination than the Charlson score in
comorbidity assessment.14
Exposure
Theprimaryexposurewasuseofanyoralantithromboticagent,
includinganticoagulantandantiplateletmedicationsforwhich
thefirstprescriptionoccurredduringthestudyinterval(eTable
1 in the Supplement). We operationalized antithrombotic ex-
posure in an intermittent, time-varying fashion (examples of
operationalization of this exposure are in the eFigure in the
Supplement). Age 66 years was selected for cohort inclusion
to allow for a 1-year look-back to ensure that patients were not
exposed to antithrombotic agents prior to study entry.
Onthedateoffillingtheirfirstprescriptionduringthestudy
interval, patients were considered “exposed” and remained
exposed until 14 days following the prescription end date
(washout period). Fifteen days following the prescription end
date, patients were considered to be “unexposed.” When the
washout period coincided with prescription renewal, pa-
tients had continuous, ongoing exposure. When patients dis-
continued antithrombotic therapy and then restarted after dis-
continuation, a new exposure period commenced. Similarly,
when patients switched medications, exposure and outcome
time was allocated to each medication during the prescrip-
tion period plus the 14-day washout period.
Outcomes
We measured counts of total hematuria-related complica-
tions, which was the sum of the counts of 3 specific end points
including the occurrence of emergency department visits for
gross hematuria, hospital admissions with a primary diagno-
sis of gross hematuria, or urologic procedures to manage gross
Key Points
Question Is there an association between the use of oral
antithrombotic agents and hematuria-related complications?
Findings In this cohort study that included 2 518 064 older adults
in Ontario, Canada, use of antithrombotic medications, compared
with nonuse of these medications, was significantly associated
with hematuria-related complications (including emergency
department visits, hospitalizations, and urologic procedures).
Meaning Use of antithrombotic medications was associated with
a significant increase in rates of hematuria-related complications.

Data Sources
We linked the following validated data sets using patients’
unique ICES key numbers: the Ontario Drug Benefit data-
base, which provides information on all outpatient prescrip-
tion pharmaceuticals15; the Canadian Institute for Health
Information Discharge Abstract Database, which contains
records for all hospitalizations16; the Canadian Institute
for Health Information National Ambulatory Care Reporting
System, which contains records for emergency department
visits; the Ontario Health Insurance Plan database, which
tracks claims paid for physician billings, laboratories, and
out-of-province providers (physicians, allied health, and
hospitals)17; the Ontario Cancer Registry, a population-based
registry estimated to be 95% or more complete18; and the
Registered Persons database for demographic information19
(validation details in eTable 3 in the Supplement).
Statistical Analysis
We measured the total number of complications each indi-
vidual experienced rather than the first presentation of a
complication. Patients contributed data until the date of
death or until the last date of follow-up. Patients with miss-
ing data were excluded from the multivariate analysis. We
calculated incidence density rates of each complication
using the total count of the complication as the numerator
and number of person-years exposed as the denominator,
stratified by exposure to antithrombotic agents. Multivari-
able negative binomial regression was used to study the
association between exposure to antithrombotic agents
(operationalized in the time-varying manner described
above) and complications due to the skewed nature of
health services data.20,21 We expressed this as the incidence
rate ratio (IRR), the ratio of incidence density rate during
antithrombotic agent exposure to the rate during unex-
posed periods. Each rate ratio was adjusted for the associa-
tion of patient age, sex, comorbidity, income quintile,
region of residence, and rurality with tests for interaction.
We tested for interaction between exposure variables using
separate interaction terms in the models (ie, exposure
A × exposure B). Where there was statistical significance,
we included the interaction term in the final model and
expressed the results using the interaction. This only
occurred for the interaction between antithrombotic expo-
sure and age at prescription. As a result, we expressed the
IRR for antithrombotic exposure in a stratified fashion
according to the patient’
s age at the time of prescription.
We compared differences in the IRR of hematuria-related
complications between medications using pairwise tests for
heterogeneity between aspirin and other antiplatelet agents
and between each of the 4 anticoagulants. Many patients re-
ceived more than 1 agent during the study interval, and some
received them concurrently. While assessing the association
of each medication, concurrent exposures were handled using
each medication as an independent exposure variable within
the multivariable models such that an effect estimate could be
derived for each medication. As concurrent antiplatelet and
anticoagulant exposure may have a synergistic effect, the as-
sociation of combination therapy was also assessed.
Subgroup Analyses
We conducted several preplanned subgroup analyses to un-
derstand modifying risks, given the known association be-
tweenhematuriaandbenignprostatichypertrophy(BPH)22and
medical kidney disease.23 As a surrogate for BPH, we exam-
ined patients’prescriptions for BPH-related medications.
We assessed the association of receipt of BPH-related medi-
cations in the year prior to antithrombotic exposure on rates
of hematuria-related complications among men (eTable 4 in
theSupplement).Then,amongallpatients,weassessedforthe
association of medical kidney disease by including consulta-
tion with a nephrologist.
We identified patients diagnosed as having bladder can-
cer within 6 months after an episode of hematuria using the
Ontario Cancer Registry. We calculated the standardized
incidence ratio (SIR) of bladder cancer among patients
receiving antithrombotic agents by identifying the age- and
sex-stratified expected number of bladder cancer cases
based on the Ontario population. We then calculated the SIR
as the ratio of the observed number of bladder cancer cases
divided by the expected number of cases. Logistic regres-
sion analysis was also performed to calculate the odds ratio
for being diagnosed as having cancer between the exposed
and unexposed group, as patients are only diagnosed as
having cancer once.
StatisticalsignificancewassetatP < .05basedona2-tailed

prise Guide 6.1 (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
We identified 4 184 141 residents of Ontario born before 1936,
who would be aged 66 years or older during the study inter-
val (2002-2014). Following exclusion of individuals who
died (n = 915 892) and emigrated (n = 317 141) prior to the
index date, those diagnosed as having a cancer (other than
nonmelanomatous skin cancer) prior to the index date
(n = 348 302), those with prior endoscopic urologic proce-
dures (n = 84 674), and those older than the age of 105 years
(n = 68), the final cohort comprised 2 518 064 individuals
aged 66 years and older. Of these, 607 323 died after the
index date, and 208 159 were lost to follow-up: 111 845 had a
date of last contact of more than 2 years before the end of the
study period, and 96 314 had loss of continuous health insur-
ance coverage.
Of these participants, 808 897 filled at least 1 prescrip-
tion for an antithrombotic agent, while 1 709 167 were not ex-
posed during the study interval. Patients who filled a prescrip-
tion for an antithrombotic agent were older (median age, 70
years vs 66 years; P < .001), more likely to be male (47.0% vs
41.9%; P < .001), had a lower level of income (20.8% vs 17.9%;
P < .001),andhadhigherlevelsofcomorbidity(30.6%vs18.4%;

were significantly more likely to have been diagnosed as hav-
ing a relevant medical condition in the 5 years preceding the
index date than those who were not exposed (Table 1).
Over a median follow-up of 7.3 years, gross hematuria-

posure to any antithrombotic agent (123.95 events/1000
person-years) than during unexposed periods (80.17

 procedures were the most common complication, the asso-
ciation between antithrombotic agent use and complica-
tions, when compared with unexposed periods, was highest
for emergency department visits (crude rate ratio, 2.80;
95% CI, 2.74-2.86), followed by hospitalizations (crude rate
ratio, 2.03; 95% CI, 2.00-2.06) and urologic procedures
(crude rate ratio, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.36-1.39). These associations
persisted on multivariable analysis with increasing age,
male sex, and increasing comorbidity being significantly
associated with rates of hematuria-related complications
(Table 3). The highest rate was for emergency visits among
adults aged 85 years and older (adjusted rate ratio, 4.74;
95% CI, 4.51-4.99; Table 3).
We then examined each antithrombotic medication indi-
vidually: 315 639 individuals filled prescriptions for aspirin
(dose ≥82 mg), 275 887 for other antiplatelet agents, 15 102
for apixaban, 43 451 for dabigatran, 87 912 for rivaroxaban,
and 320 347 for warfarin. Hematuria-related complications
were more common during exposure to anticoagulants than
antiplatelet agents, and patients experienced the lowest rates
of complications during exposure to older medications (aspi-
rin and warfarin; Table 2). Among anticoagulants, in multi-
variable models, exposure to dabigatran (and not warfarin)
was associated with the lowest rate of complications, while
rivaroxaban had the highest rate for each age group (Table 4).
Other antiplatelet agents, including clopidogrel, prasugrel,
tricagrelor, ticlopidine, and dipyridamole, were associated
with higher rates of hematuria-related complications than
acetylsalicylic acid (≥82-mg dosage; Table 4).
Patients taking a combination of any antiplatelet agent and
any anticoagulant experienced significantly increased rates of
hematuria-related complications, particularly for hospitaliza-
tions (range of rate ratios, 2.68-4.16) and emergency depart-
ment visits (range of rate ratios, 6.03-10.48) (Table 5).
Sensitivity Analysis
While clot evacuation, control of bladder bleeding, and cys-
toscopy are unlikely to be indicated for patients without a
history of bladder cancer in the absence of hematuria, ure-
thral catheterization may be indicated owing to urinary
retention. Thus, we performed a sensitivity analysis exclud-
ing catheterization from the definition of urologic proce-
dures. While the overall event rate was lower, in regression
models, the direction and magnitude of association were
similar to the primary analysis, with antithrombotic exposure
associated with a rate ratio of hematuria-related complica-
tions ranging from 1.39 to 2.36, depending on patient age
(all P < .001; eTable 5 in the Supplement).
Subgroup Analyses
To examine the association of BPH and medical kidney dis-
ease on hematuria, we used surrogate measures including
prescriptions of BPH medications and consultations with
nephrologists. Prescription of a BPH-related medication in
the year prior to antithrombotic prescription was also associ-
ated with an increased rate of hematuria-related complica-
tions (range of adjusted rate ratios, 1.67-1.93; all P < .001).
This association persisted across secondary outcomes and

 individual antithrombotic medication exposures. Similarly,
nephrology consultation was significantly associated with an
increased risk of hematuria-related complications (range of
adjusted rate ratios, 1.88-2.26; all P < .001).
In addition, 12 108 of 425 350 individuals (2.85%; 95% CI,
2.80%-2.90%) who presented with a hematuria-related com-
plication were subsequently diagnosed as having bladder
cancer within 6 months. A significantly higher proportion of
patients exposed to antithrombotic agents (0.70%) were
diagnosed as having bladder cancer than those who were
unexposed to these agents (0.38%; unadjusted odds ratio,
1.85; 95% CI, 1.79-1.92). We calculated the standardized inci-
dence ratio of bladder cancer among patients receiving anti-
thrombotic agents, compared with the general Ontario popu-
lation, with age and sex adjustment. Those receiving
antithrombotic prescriptions had significantly more bladder
cancer diagnoses than expected (SIR, 2.38; 95% CI, 2.32-
2.44). Among women, the SIR was 2.17 (95% CI, 2.06-2.30)
and among men it was 2.33 (95% CI, 2.26-2.40). Standardized
incidence ratios of other urologist-managed cancers (prostate
cancer: SIR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.73-0.77, and kidney cancer: SIR,
0.64; 95% CI, 0.59-0.68) were not elevated among patients
prescribed antithrombotic agents. The unadjusted odds ratio
for being diagnosed as having prostate cancer was 1.65 (95%
CI, 1.62-1.73) for patients in the exposed group, compared
with the unexposed group, and for kidney cancer was 1.50
(95% CI, 1.4-1.6). Specific frequency of cancers and BPH out-
comes are detailed in eTable 6 in the Supplement and the dis-
tribution of duration of time for each antithrombotic medica-
tion are detailed in eTable 7 in the Supplement.
Discussion
In this population-based cohort study among 2 518 064 older
adults in Ontario, Canada, treatment with antithrombotic
medications, compared with nonuse of these medications,
was significantly associated with increased rates of
hematuria-related complications (including emergency
department visits, hospitalizations, and urologic procedures
to manage gross hematuria). While there was variation
between medications, this association was present for all
medications examined. Readily identifiable factors, includ-
ing patient age, male sex, comorbidity, and preexistent uro-
logic disease, were significantly associated with rates of gross
hematuria. Patients taking antithrombotic agents were more
likely to be diagnosed as having bladder cancer, both com-
pared with unexposed individuals and with the general

 population. As there is no putative mechanistic linkage, these
data suggest that use of antithrombotic agents was likely
unmasking otherwise clinically silent bladder cancers.
In 1994, a prospective study of 243 patients receiving oral
anticoagulation concluded that there was no association be-
tween anticoagulant use and hematuria.8 These data are out-
dated given the introduction of novel anticoagulant and anti-
platelet agents. More recently, observational postmarketing
surveillance reports have included other sources of “extracra-
nial bleeding”24,25 but none have explicitly examined the as-
sociation between hematuria and treatment with antithrom-
botic agents.
Historically, hematuria, particularly among patients
taking antithrombotic agents, was associated with a signifi-
cant burden of clinically significant, and potentially life-
threatening, urologic disease.26,27 This analysis identified an
association of asymptomatic bladder cancer among patients
undergoing antithrombotic therapy, with an SIR of 2.4,
although the absolute rate of bladder cancer remains low.
Compared with the control group, in this study, positive as-
sociations for being diagnosed as having prostate and kidney
cancer were found between the exposed and unexposed
groups, but there was no increase in their SIRs. This is be-
cause the SIR was based on comparison with the general popu-
lation, which is more heterogeneous than the control group
that was used in the analysis.
A previous population-based study in Ontario showed
that randomized clinical trials significantly underestimate

 rates of hemorrhage associated with warfarin therapy.28
Compared with warfarin, recent studies have shown lower
rates of intracranial bleeding for each of the direct oral anti-
coagulants individually and, when combined, major bleeding
is also reduced.29 In contrast, this analysis demonstrated an
increased rate of hematuria-related complications associated
with rivaroxaban use and comparable rate between warfarin
and other newer anticoagulants. A similar result has been
observed for gastrointestinal bleeding and abnormal uterine
bleeding in menstruating women.30,31 There is no clear bio-
logic explanation why there were observed differences in
hematuria complications between different antithrombotic
agents. Further study into the exact mechanisms of the
causes of hematuria from the urinary tract based on their
mechanism of action will be necessary.
Long-term antithrombotic decisions often require com-
plex risk-benefit considerations. Among patients with a
clear indication for anticoagulation, these medications are
associated with improved survival.2,3 Over time, significant
changes in the prescribing of antithrombotic medications
have occurred and overall use has significantly expanded.32
Gross hematuria can be significantly distressing to
patients33 and may contribute to subsequent poor adher-
ence with antithrombotic therapy,34,35 which has been
shown to increase the risk of stroke and death.35 Similarly,
antithrombotic discontinuation due to bleeding contributes
to increased rates of thrombotic events.36 Thus, the persis-
tent risk of thrombotic events and relative infrequency of
hematuria requiring hospitalization suggest that ongoing
anticoagulant use is often warranted. Research to produce
patient-specific decision aids based on cost-benefit or cost-
effectiveness analyses incorporating reductions in throm-
botic events, as well as hematuria and other adverse events,
would be valuable.
Strengths
This sample was larger than recent nationwide cohort stud-
ies assessing bleeding events from antithrombotic treatment
inDenmark25andFrance.37Inadditiontothelargesamplesize,
this study has significant strengths owing to its population-
based nature. First, this study was performed in Ontario,
Canada, a jurisdiction in which all relevant medications and
health services are available free of cost to seniors and are sys-
tematically tracked in administrative databases. Second, as all
patients older than the age of 66 years in the largest province
of Canada were identified, these results are generalizable. Un-
like randomized clinical trials with strict inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria or institutional reports representing tertiary care
patterns, these results represent the population spectrum of
clinical practice. Third, all hospitalizations and emergency de-
partment visits occurring anywhere in the province of Ontario
were captured. This eliminates recall bias and minimizes se-
lection bias. Thus, the outcome ascertainment is more robust
than institutional studies. Fourth, as patients may stop anti-
thrombotic medications owing to adverse events, they may
transition from exposed to unexposed states and back. The use
of a time-varying exposure used herein allows for accurate at-
tribution of exposure for each patient at the time of each he-
maturia-related event. For this reason, survival analysis could
not be conducted with competing risk analysis with morbid-
ity and mortality, which would cause the exposure to cease.
Limitations
This study had 5 limitations. First, owing to funding eli-
gibility for prescription medications in Ontario, the cohort
was restricted to patients aged 66 years and older. Given
the interaction between age and the association of antithrom-
botic therapies with hematuria-related complications,
these results are not directly applicable to younger patients.

 Second, the databases preclude capture of the use of
over-the-counter low-dose aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatories. Low-dose aspirin has been associated with
lower rates of major bleeding compared with higher-dose
therapy.38,39 Thus, as high-dose aspirin (≥82 mg) had the
lowest rate ratio for hematuria-related complications of
all agents examined, low-dose aspirin is unlikely to be associ-
ated with a clinically significant risk of hematuria. Low-
molecular-weight heparins were not included in the analysis
owing to differing indications and their typical short dura-
tions of use. Thus, these results should only be applied to
oral antithrombotic agents. Third, exposure ascertainment
relied on data on prescriptions filled as a surrogate for medi-
cation use without verification of medication consumption.
Nonadherence estimates have ranged from 25% to 55%40 and
would bias these results toward the null. Fourth, the out-
come definition was restricted to hospitalizations and emer-
gency department visits, excluding outpatient office physi-
cian interactions. Hospitalizations, emergency department
visits, and urologic interventions are likely to capture most
significant episodes of gross hematuria and the validity of
these diagnoses has been well established in Ontario,16
while this is not true for diagnostic fields associated with out-
patient consultations. However, the specific diagnoses and
procedures examined in this study have not been directly
validated. For urological procedures, these were used as sur-
rogates for actual complications without an ability to ascertain
the indication for each intervention. While there are alterna-
tive indications for urethral catheterization (namely, acute uri-
nary retention), few alternatives exist for cystoscopy, clot re-
moval/irrigation, or control of bladder bleeding in the absence
of a history of bladder cancer. A sensitivity analysis removing

 urethral catheterization from the outcome definition did not
substantively change the findings. Fifth, the available data sets
lacked information on the doses of antithrombotic medica-
tions, cumulative dose exposure, patient weight or body mass
index, international normalized ratio values for patients tak-
ing warfarin, and alcohol consumption. However, within the
study, a proportion of patients served as their own controls for
the time they were not taking an antithrombotic medication,
which would minimize this bias.
Conclusions
Among older adults in Ontario, Canada, use of antithrom-
botic medications, compared with nonuse of these medica-
tions, was significantly associated with higher rates of hema-
turia-related complications (including emergency department
visits, hospitalizations, and urologic procedures to manage
gross hematuria).
