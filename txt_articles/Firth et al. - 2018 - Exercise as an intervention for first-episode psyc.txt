Abstract
Aim: Exercise can improve psychiatric
symptoms, neurocognitive functioning
and physical health in schizophrenia.
However, the effects in early psychosis
have not been explored. This study
aimed to assess the feasibility of an
exercise intervention for early psychosis
and to determine if it was associated
with changes in physical and mental
health.
Methods:
Thirty-one
patients
with
first-episode
psychosis
(FEP)
were
recruited
from
early
intervention
services to a 10-week exercise in-
tervention.
The
intervention
group
received individualized training pro-
grammes, aiming to achieve ≥90min
of moderate-to-vigorous activity each
week, using exercise programmes tai-
lored to individual preferences and
needs. A comparison FEP sample from
the
same
services
(n = 7)
received
treatment as usual.
Results: Rates of consent and retention
in the exercise group were 94% and
81%, respectively. Participants achieved
an average of 107 min of moderate-to-
vigorous exercise per week. Positive
and Negative Syndrome Scale total
scores reduced by 13.3 points after
10weeks of exercise, which was sig-
nificantly greater than the treatment
as usual comparison group (P=0.010).
The greatest differences were observed
in negative symptoms, which reduced
by 33% in the intervention group
(P=0.013). Significant improvements
were also observed in psychosocial
functioning
and
verbal
short-term
memory. Increases in cardiovascular
fitness
and
processing
speed
were
positively associated with the amounts
of exercise achieved by participants.
Conclusion:
Individualized
exercise
training
could
provide
a
feasible
treatment option for improving sym-
ptomatic, neurocognitive and meta-
bolic outcomes in FEP.
Key words: early intervention, exercise, physical activity, physical health,
schizophrenia.
INTRODUCTION
Exercise has been found to reduce positive and
negative symptoms and improve cognitive functioning
in people with long-term schizophrenia, provided that
sufficient amounts of moderate-to-vigorous activity
are achieved.1 However, this has yet to be explored in
first-episode psychosis (FEP), despite evidence that
interventions to improve negative and cognitive sym-
ptoms may be more effective in the early phases of
illness.2,3 Furthermore, healthy lifestyle interventions,
which incorporate both exercise and dietary com-
ponents,
can
significantly
improve
psychosocial
functioning in FEP.4 Cross-sectional studies have also
indicated
that
physical
activity
and
fitness
are
associated with improved functional outcomes.5,6
Additionally, FEP is a critical period for attenuating
weight gain and metabolic dysfunction, which begins
within weeks of starting antipsychotic medication.7,8
There is a fivefold increase in metabolic syndrome
within the first few years of treatment,9 which
heightens the risk of cardiovascular diseases and
contributes towards the premature mortality of 15–
20years for people with schizophrenia.10 Physical
activity interventions may counteract this, because
cardiorespiratory fitness is one of the strongest

 predictors of metabolic health following anti-psychotic
treatment,11 and is improved by exercise during the
early stages of illness.12,13 FEP may also be the optimal
timeframe to establish lasting habits of regular exercise
when patients are younger, more active14 and relatively
free of obesity-related disorders, which may act as a
barrier towards exercise.15
We conducted an exploratory study, ‘Investigating
the Benefits of Exercise in Early Psychosis’ (‘IBEEP’)
to examine the extent to which young adults with
FEP will participate in exercise and to assess any
associated
change
in
symptoms,
cognitive
functioning and physical health. Previous exercise
interventions
in
schizophrenia
have
had
poor
adherence and high attrition,16 possibly due to low
motivation
among
patients.12,17
Thus,
we
used
individualized exercise programmes, tailored to each
participant’s preferences and needs, to make exercise
accessible and intrinsically motivating.
METHOD
The IBEEP study was approved by the North West
Research Ethics Committee on 18/12/2013 (REC#
13/NW/0784) and registered with the current clinical
trials database (ISRCTN09150095). Participants were
recruited from community-based early intervention
(EI) services in Greater Manchester West NHS Trust.
In the United Kingdom, EI services are offered to
any individuals aged 14–35 who are experiencing
FEP (defined as full-threshold psychotic symptoms
for a period of greater than 7 consecutive days),
regardless of formal diagnostic status. Thus, in order
to assess exercise as an intervention for FEP more
broadly and inform its implementation within EI
services, no restrictions were placed on patients’
diagnosis in this study. Inclusion criteria for the
intervention group were the following: (i) being a
current service user of EI services within the first
5years of a psychotic disorder; (ii) aged 18–35; (iii)
experiencing current psychological difficulties, having
either a score of ≥2 on the World Health Organization
(WHO) Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS
2.0)18 or ≥21 on the Beck Depression Inventory 2.0
(BDI-II).19 Exclusion criteria were the inability to
provide informed consent, pregnancy, insufficient
English language to complete assessments, and/or
physical health issues that contraindicated exercise.
These included poorly controlled asthma, diagnosed
heart conditions, untreated hypertension and other
medical
conditions,
and
were assessed
by
the
referring clinician.
Recruitment was conducted by meeting with EI
teams and asking them to refer any of their service
users who seemed suitable to participate in the study
(along with leaving leaflets in EI waiting rooms).
Those referred were contacted by telephone to assess
their interest in the study and then screened against
the inclusion criteria before being met in person to
provide written informed consent. The study was
conducted as a non-randomized feasibility trial, with
all participants being allocated to the intervention
group. Comparison data were obtained from the
treatment-as-usual (TAU) control group of a separate
trial, which was taking place within the same clinical
services over the same timeframe (ISRCTN06815355).
These participants were also in the first 5years of
onset of a psychotic disorder and aged 18–35 but
received no exercise.
Intervention
Exercise was delivered through community leisure
services. These services are widespread in UK and are
funded by local government to offer subsidized gym
memberships and sporting activities for people referred
by the National Health Service. The intervention was
10weeks long and designed to enable each participant
to achieve 90min of moderate-to-vigorous exercise
per week, as this amount of exercise can improve
physical and mental health in schizophrenia.1
Participants were offered gym training sessions
twice
per
week
at
their
local
leisure
centres,
supervised by a research assistant who had several
years of exercise experience. A standardized training
guide
(Supporting
Information)
was
developed
through consultation with the exercise physiologist
(JM).
Sessions
aimed
to
achieve
45–60min
of
moderate-to-vigorous activity using aerobic and
resistance exercises. The specific activities for any
given session were selected on the basis of participant
preference, in order to maximize adherence and
engagement with exercise.20 Options for aerobic
exercise to improve cardiovascular health included
treadmills, cycle ergometers and rowing machines.
Resistance training included exercises for all the
major muscle groups of the arms, legs and torso to
increase muscle tone and strength. For resistance
exercises, participants completed three sets of 8–12
repetitions per exercise. Mandatory gym inductions
were provided by personal trainers at community
leisure centres (who were also available for further
support throughout).
Additionally or alternatively to the gym training
sessions, participants were able to undertake other
sporting activities to meet their weekly exercise targets
(Table 1). Research assistants took responsibility for
arranging
participants’
access
and
transport
to

 gyms/leisure services. An exercise logbook was used
to set initial goals and monitor participants’ impro-
vement during the intervention, both of which can
increase motivation and adherence.21 The logbook
was also completed by research assistants after each
session to record attendance, duration, modality and
intensity of exercise. This standardized process was
replicated across all three EI sites.
Primary outcomes
As a feasibility trial, the primary outcomes were
recruitment,
retention
and
amount
of
exercise
achieved. Recruitment rate was defined as ‘number
of patients who consented to take part’ divided by
‘number of patients approached’. Retention was
defined as completing both the 10-week intervention
and the psychiatric assessments at follow-up. The
amount of exercise achieved was determined from
the logbooks, calculated as average minutes per week
(mean) over 10weeks. This was analysed across all
participants who were offered the intervention to
provide a realistic evaluation of how the intervention
would transpire in practice. The target amount of
exercise was set at 90min of moderate-to-vigorous
activity per week.1,22 Any reported increases in low-
intensity exercise (i.e. walking) were also recorded,
but analysed separately.
Between-subjects change outcomes
The principle change
outcome was psychiatric
symptoms. This was measured using the Positive
and
Negative
Syndrome
Scale
(PANSS).23
This
structured clinical interview was administered by
research assistants to each participant during the
week prior to commencing their intervention and
then repeated within 2weeks of completion (or
within 8–12weeks of the baseline assessments for
the TAU group).
Within-subjects outcomes
A range of additional measures were administered to
the intervention group to investigate which other
outcomes could feasibly show significant change from
10weeks of exercise, thus informing target outcomes
for future RCTs. To reduce participant burden (and
assess the acceptability of these assessments), subjects
were able to opt in or out of secondary measures
without affecting their status in the trial. Secondary
measures of mental health included the BDI-II19 for
depression and the ‘Social Interaction Anxiety Scale’ 24
for anxiety. Functional disability was evaluated using
the
‘Socio-Occupational
Functioning
Assessment
Scale’,25 the WHODAS 2.018 and the WHO Quality
of Life Brief Assessment (WHOQOL-BREF).26
Physical health was assessed using standard pro-
cedures for body mass index, waist circumference
and systolic/diastolic blood pressure. Aerobic fitness
was estimated using the 6-Minute Walk (6MW) test,27
conducted on a 20-m track in a sports hall. Muscular
power was assessed as ‘vertical jump height’ using
the Sargent Jump protocol.28 Changes in self-reported
physical
activity
were
measured
using
the
International Physical Activity Questionnaire.29
Computerized cognitive testing was administered
using a touch-screen interface. Our battery consisted
of four ‘Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Auto-
mated Battery’30 tasks, four traditional neuropsyc-
hological
tasks
(administered
using
‘Psychology
Experiment Building Language’31) and a test of social
cognition. The full task battery is detailed in Table 2.
Statistical analysis
Statistical tests were conducted in SPSS 20.32 Values
were checked for normality using Shapiro–Wilk tests
and normal probability plots. A ‘full analysis set’

 approach was used throughout to include all avai-
lable data for every outcome measure.33 Primary out-
comes of feasibility were summarized using sample
means and percentages. Changes in psychiatric sym-
ptoms were compared between exercise and TAU
groups using between-subjects t-tests (Welch’s t).
Additional outcomes measures for the intervention
group were assessed using within-subjects t-tests
after applying a Bonferroni correction to account for
the number of measures used.
RESULTS
Feasibility measures
Within 5months of recruitment (05/01/2014–06/06/
2014), 51 service users had been referred by EI
services. These were contacted in date order until
the target sample of 30 was surpassed. The recrui-
tment rate was 94%; 31/33 of eligible referrals who
were contacted were willing to participate in the
IBEEP study and subsequently consented to take
part. . All were EI service users aged 18–35 (average
length of service use=1.9years), currently receiving
antipsychotic medications. In addition, comparison
data were available from the seven EI service users
who had been allocated to the TAU control group of
a
separate
trial.
Baseline
characteristics
are
compared in Table 3.
The retention rate was 81%, with 25/31 of the
intervention group completing the 10-week exercise
programme and follow-up assessments (Fig. 1).
Three of the 6 dropouts were related to ‘serious
adverse events’: one for chronic physical illness and
two due to mental illness leading to hospitalization.
These serious adverse events were reviewed by the
NHS Research Office and deemed unrelated to study
participation.
The average amount of moderate-to-vigorous
exercise (as recorded in the logbooks) for the 28
participants who were offered the intervention was
107min per week. Half of the participants exceeded
the exercise target, averaging ≥90min per week for
10weeks, and 79% achieved ≥60min per week.
Sixteen participants also reported increasing their
low-intensity exercise during their exercise prog-
ramme, achieving a mean average of 41.4min of
additional walking per week.
Supervised gym sessions accounted for the vast
majority of exercise achieved by participants (Table 1).
In line with participant preference, sessions mostly
comprised of a mixture of aerobic and resistance
exercises (Supporting Information) and were con-
ducted either in a one-to-one basis or in small groups
of two to three participants. Reasons given for missed
sessions were physical ill health (27%), conflicting
social/occupational
commitments
(26%),
con-
flicting healthcare appointments (14%), feeling
tired/aching (11%), medication side effects (8%)
and mental ill health (6%).

 (WHODAS/WHOQOL). However, socio-occupational
functioning increased by 5.8 points on the Socio-
Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale’ scale
(P<0.001).
Among the cognitive domains, verbal short-term
memory showed the greatest change, increasing from
6.2 to 8.1 words (P< 0.001). Moderate improvements
in social cognition (‘Mind in the Eyes’, P=0.009),
processing speed (‘Trail Making-A’, P=0.086 and
‘Trail Making-B’, P=0.009), executive functioning
(‘Stockings of Cambridge’, P=0.043) and inhibitory
control (‘Flanker task’, P=0.044) fell short of the
Bonferroni-adjusted significance level. No changes
occurred in motor function or spatial span.
In physical health, body mass index remained
unchanged (�0.34, P=0.265). Waist circumference
decreased
by
2cm
(P=0.008),
although
this
improvement also fell short of the adjusted sig-
nificance
threshold.
Blood
pressure
showed
no
change in either systolic (�4.7mmHg, P=0.057) or
diastolic (�3.37mmHg, P=0.343) readings. Fitness
tests were completed by only 15 participants; the 34-
m increase in 6-min walk distance was not statistically
significant (P=0.057), and there was no change in
standing jump. Self-reported activity levels (calculated
from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire
guidelines as moderate-to-vigorous MET-minutes per
week) had more than trebled by the end of the
intervention (P=0.001), even after excluding the one
high-end
outlier.
Additionally,
this
self-reported
activity correlated strongly with amounts of exercise
recorded in logbooks (rs25=0.717, P<0.001).
Post hoc testing
On the basis of previous literature, we had expected
6MW distance (fitness) and the Trail Making Task
(processing speed) would be particularly sensitive to
exercise. However, improvements in these areas did
not reach significance, perhaps due to smaller
numbers of participants completing these measures.
Thus, a post hoc analysis was conducted to examine

relationship
between
these
outcomes
and
engagement in exercise. The amount of exercise
achieved
was
significantly
correlated
with
im-
provements in fitness (rs(14)=0.55, P=0.042) and
processing
speed
(Trail
Making-A
(rs(20)=0.48,
P=0.032), Trail Making-B (rs(20)=0.47, P=0.037)).
DISCUSSION
Feasibility of the intervention
Individualized exercise has previously been indicated
as the optimal method for increasing physical activity
among people with serious mental illness, as allowing
participants to choose preferred activities can their
boost intrinsic motivation towards exercise.20 Although
previous
exercise
studies
in
schizophrenia
have
experienced poor adherence,16 our study found that
young people, in the early stages of illness, engaged
well with individualized exercise. Although participants
were largely inactive upon entering the study (as
indicated by baseline International Physical Activity
Questionnaire scores29), participants changed their
sedentary lifestyles to achieve 107min of moderate-
to-vigorous activity per week for 10weeks, thus
surpassing the 90-min target.
Of 28 participants who received the intervention,
25 were retained over the 10-week intervention and
pre-post assessments. This compares favourably with
attrition observed in long-term schizophrenia and
even healthy populations.16,34 The acceptability of
exercise in EI services was also indicated by the ample
number of referrals received from care coordinators,
who were asked to refer any service users who might
be suitable for the trial. Furthermore, a high pro-
portion of those invited to who were invited to
consent did participate in the study (94%). These
findings suggest that individualized gym training is a
feasible and engaging intervention in FEP.
Exercise and mental health
This was the first study to examine the effects of
exercise on psychiatric symptoms in early psychosis.
Total PANSS scores decreased by 27% after 10weeks
of exercise; a significantly greater improvement than
in the TAU group. The greatest improvements were
observed in negative symptoms, which are often left
untreated in FEP, but have a particularly strong
impact on long-term recovery.35,36 The magnitude
of improvement observed in both total symptoms
and negative symptoms was clinically significant.37
We also found a significant improvement in social
functioning in the intervention group. A blinded
RCT is now required to definitively establish the
efficacy of exercise for FEP.
Our findings are consistent with exercise studies in
long-term schizophrenia, showing that ≥90min of
moderate-to-vigorous exercise per week can sig-
nificantly reduce psychiatric symptoms.1 Through
providing effective treatment for negative symptoms
early on, exercise could be used to facilitate full
recovery and reduce the likelihood of enduring
disability. Recent observational studies have similarly
reported a positive association between exercise and
better functional outcomes in FEP.4–6
Previous research in long-term schizophrenia has
shown that improving physical fitness may also
reduce cognitive deficits, possibly through increasing
brain-derived neurotrophic factor.38–40 Deficits in
verbal STM and processing speed are common in
FEP and predictive of overall functioning.41,42 Fur-
thermore, these domains are the most sensitive to
exercise in long-term patients.43–45 In this study,
verbal STM showed the largest pre-post changes,
exceeding the degree of improvement that can be
accounted for by practice effects.46 Furthermore,
increase in processing speed was positively asso-
ciated with the amounts of exercise achieved, indi-
cating a dose–response relationship in FEP.
Exercise and physical health
People with schizophrenia are substantially more
inactive than the general population,47 and this is
associated with the obesity and cardiometabolic
diseases observed in this population.48 The early
stages of psychosis may be the optimal period for
implementing exercise to improve physical health,
because preventing cardiometabolic disorders from
arising is more feasible than reversing the long-term
consequences, and patients are more likely to engage
with physical activity at this time.14,49
The 0.9kg decrease in body weight and 2cm
reduction in waist circumference both fell short of
significance. Nonetheless, these marginal impro-
vements after just 10weeks are encouraging findings,
because changes in body composition generally
require longer-term exercise programmes.50 Fur-
thermore, a more realistic and immediate goal of
exercise programmes in FEP may be attenuating the
usual trajectory of weight gain.51
Previous studies have also observed successful
attention of anti-psychotic induced weight gain from
exercise in FEP, along with significant improvements
in aerobic fitness, as measured by V02 Max (which is
the gold standard in fitness testing).4,12,13 In this
study, improvements in 6-min walk distance (+34m)

 fell short of statistical significance (P=0.057). This
may be due the relatively short training period or
the assessment method used, because the 6MW test
was
originally
developed
for
older
adults.27
It
therefore may not be sensitive to subtle changes in
aerobic fitness in young people with psychosis.52
Nonetheless,
a
post
hoc
analysis
revealed
a
correlation between increases in fitness and amounts
of exercise achieved by participants, indicating a
dose–response relationship. There was also a large
increase in self-reported physical activity, which had
trebled after 10weeks. If sustained, this would confer
substantial health benefits for people with FEP,
because fitness and physical activity are more
predictive of all-cause mortality than any other
metabolic risk indicators.53,54
Limitations and conclusions
The findings of this exploratory study are limited by
the non-randomized design and small sample size,
particularly
in
the
control
condition.
A
further
limitation is the multifaceted nature of the inter-
vention, which makes it difficult to separate the
physiological effects of exercise from the positive
social context within which it was administered.
Future studies could overcome these limitations using
randomized, time-and-attention control conditions.
It should also be considered that the research
assistants who facilitated exercise had no formal
exercise qualifications. Instead, the intervention was
developed on the basis of recommendations from an
exercise
physiologist
(JM),
and
on-site
exercise
instruction was provided by qualified staff at com-
munity leisure centres. Nonetheless, the high levels
of acceptability and engagement suggests that future
trials could also take advantage of the expertise and
facilities available through community leisure services
to provide low cost and destigmatising interventions.
Our findings indicate this could improve physical,
psychological and social outcomes for young adults
with FEP.55 Future work should therefore investigate
novel methods for connecting EI services with exercise
resources, and for embedding exercise specialists
within EI services, in order to maximize accessibility
and
broaden
possibilities
for
delivering
such
interventions in clinical practice.
