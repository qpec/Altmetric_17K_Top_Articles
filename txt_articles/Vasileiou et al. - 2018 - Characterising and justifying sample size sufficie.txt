research over a 15-year period

Abstract
Background: Choosing a suitable sample size in qualitative research is an area of conceptual debate and practical
uncertainty. That sample size principles, guidelines and tools have been developed to enable researchers to set,
and justify the acceptability of, their sample size is an indication that the issue constitutes an important marker of
the quality of qualitative research. Nevertheless, research shows that sample size sufficiency reporting is often poor,
if not absent, across a range of disciplinary fields.
Methods: A systematic analysis of single-interview-per-participant designs within three health-related journals from
the disciplines of psychology, sociology and medicine, over a 15-year period, was conducted to examine whether
and how sample sizes were justified and how sample size was characterised and discussed by authors. Data pertinent
to sample size were extracted and analysed using qualitative and quantitative analytic techniques.
Results: Our findings demonstrate that provision of sample size justifications in qualitative health research is limited; is
not contingent on the number of interviews; and relates to the journal of publication. Defence of sample size
was most frequently supported across all three journals with reference to the principle of saturation and to
pragmatic considerations. Qualitative sample sizes were predominantly – and often without justification – characterised
as insufficient (i.e., ‘small’) and discussed in the context of study limitations. Sample size insufficiency was seen
to threaten the validity and generalizability of studies’ results, with the latter being frequently conceived in nomothetic
terms.
Conclusions: We recommend, firstly, that qualitative health researchers be more transparent about evaluations of their
sample size sufficiency, situating these within broader and more encompassing assessments of data adequacy.
Secondly, we invite researchers critically to consider how saturation parameters found in prior methodological
studies and sample size community norms might best inform, and apply to, their own project and encourage
that data adequacy is best appraised with reference to features that are intrinsic to the study at hand. Finally,
those reviewing papers have a vital role in supporting and encouraging transparent study-specific reporting.

 Background
Sample adequacy in qualitative inquiry pertains to the
appropriateness of the sample composition and size. It is
an important consideration in evaluations of the quality
and trustworthiness of much qualitative research [1] and
is implicated – particularly for research that is situated
within a post-positivist tradition and retains a degree of
commitment to realist ontological premises – in ap-
praisals of validity and generalizability [2–5].
Samples in qualitative research tend to be small in
order to support the depth of case-oriented analysis that
is fundamental to this mode of inquiry [5]. Additionally,
qualitative samples are purposive, that is, selected by
virtue of their capacity to provide richly-textured infor-
mation, relevant to the phenomenon under investigation.
As a result, purposive sampling [6, 7] – as opposed to
probability sampling employed in quantitative research
– selects ‘information-rich’ cases [8]. Indeed, recent
research demonstrates the greater efficiency of purposive
sampling compared to random sampling in qualitative
studies [9], supporting related assertions long put for-
ward by qualitative methodologists.
Sample size in qualitative research has been the sub-
ject of enduring discussions [4, 10, 11]. Whilst the quan-
titative research community has established relatively
straightforward statistics-based rules to set sample sizes
precisely, the intricacies of qualitative sample size deter-
mination and assessment arise from the methodological,
theoretical, epistemological, and ideological pluralism
that characterises qualitative inquiry (for a discussion fo-
cused on the discipline of psychology see [12]). This mit-
igates against clear-cut guidelines, invariably applied.
Despite these challenges, various conceptual develop-
ments have sought to address this issue, with guidance
and principles [4, 10, 11, 13–20], and more recently, an
evidence-based approach to sample size determination
seeks to ground the discussion empirically [21–35].
Focusing on single-interview-per-participant qualita-
tive designs, the present study aims to further con-
tribute to the dialogue of sample size in qualitative
research by offering empirical evidence around justifi-
cation practices associated with sample size. We next
review the existing conceptual and empirical literature
on sample size determination.
Sample size in qualitative research: Conceptual
developments and empirical investigations
Qualitative research experts argue that there is no
straightforward answer to the question of ‘how many’
and that sample size is contingent on a number of fac-
tors relating to epistemological, methodological and
practical issues [36]. Sandelowski [4] recommends that
qualitative sample sizes are large enough to allow the
unfolding of a ‘new and richly textured understanding’
of the phenomenon under study, but small enough so
that the ‘deep, case-oriented analysis’ (p. 183) of qualita-
tive data is not precluded. Morse [11] posits that the
more useable data are collected from each person, the
fewer participants are needed. She invites researchers to
take into account parameters, such as the scope of study,
the nature of topic (i.e. complexity, accessibility), the
quality of data, and the study design. Indeed, the level of
structure of questions in qualitative interviewing has
been found to influence the richness of data generated
[37], and so, requires attention; empirical research shows
that open questions, which are asked later on in the
interview, tend to produce richer data [37].
Beyond such guidance, specific numerical recommen-
dations have also been proffered, often based on experts’
experience of qualitative research. For example, Green
and Thorogood [38] maintain that the experience of
most qualitative researchers conducting an interview-
based study with a fairly specific research question is
that little new information is generated after interview-
ing 20 people or so belonging to one analytically relevant
participant ‘category’ (pp. 102–104). Ritchie et al. [39]
suggest that studies employing individual interviews
conduct no more than 50 interviews so that researchers
are able to manage the complexity of the analytic task.
Similarly, Britten [40] notes that large interview studies
will often comprise of 50 to 60 people. Experts have
also offered numerical guidelines tailored to different
theoretical and methodological traditions and specific
research approaches, e.g. grounded theory, phenomen-
ology [11, 41]. More recently, a quantitative tool was
proposed [42] to support a priori sample size determin-
ation based on estimates of the prevalence of themes in
the population. Nevertheless, this more formulaic ap-
proach raised criticisms relating to assumptions about
the conceptual [43] and ontological status of ‘themes’
[44] and the linearity ascribed to the processes of sam-
pling, data collection and data analysis [45].
In terms of principles, Lincoln and Guba [17] pro-
posed that sample size determination be guided by the
criterion of informational redundancy, that is, sampling
can be terminated when no new information is elicited
by sampling more units. Following the logic of informa-
tional comprehensiveness Malterud et al. [18] intro-
duced the concept of information power as a pragmatic
guiding principle, suggesting that the more information
power the sample provides, the smaller the sample size
needs to be, and vice versa.
Undoubtedly, the most widely used principle for deter-
mining sample size and evaluating its sufficiency is that
of saturation. The notion of saturation originates in
grounded theory [15] – a qualitative methodological
approach explicitly concerned with empirically-derived
theory development – and is inextricably linked to
Vasileiou et al. BMC Medical Research Methodology          (2018) 18:148 
Page 2 of 18
 theoretical sampling. Theoretical sampling describes an
iterative process of data collection, data analysis and the-
ory development whereby data collection is governed by
emerging theory rather than predefined characteristics
of the population. Grounded theory saturation (often
called theoretical saturation) concerns the theoretical
categories – as opposed to data – that are being devel-
oped and becomes evident when ‘gathering fresh data no
longer sparks new theoretical insights, nor reveals new
properties of your core theoretical categories’ [46 p.
113]. Saturation in grounded theory, therefore, does not
equate to the more common focus on data repetition
and moves beyond a singular focus on sample size as the
justification of sampling adequacy [46, 47]. Sample size
in grounded theory cannot be determined a priori as it
is contingent on the evolving theoretical categories.
Saturation – often under the terms of ‘data’ or ‘the-
matic’ saturation – has diffused into several qualitative
communities beyond its origins in grounded theory.
Alongside the expansion of its meaning, being variously
equated with ‘no new data’
, ‘no new themes’
, and ‘no new
codes’
, saturation has emerged as the ‘gold standard’ in
qualitative inquiry [2, 26]. Nevertheless, and as Morse
[48] asserts, whilst saturation is the most frequently in-
voked ‘guarantee of qualitative rigor’
, ‘it is the one we
know least about’ (p. 587). Certainly researchers caution
that saturation is less applicable to, or appropriate for,
particular types of qualitative research (e.g. conversation
analysis, [49]; phenomenological research, [50]) whilst
others reject the concept altogether [19, 51].
Methodological studies in this area aim to provide
guidance about saturation and develop a practical appli-
cation of processes that ‘operationalise’ and evidence sat-
uration. Guest, Bunce, and Johnson [26] analysed 60
interviews and found that saturation of themes was
reached by the twelfth interview. They noted that their
sample was relatively homogeneous, their research aims
focused, so studies of more heterogeneous samples and
with a broader scope would be likely to need a larger
size to achieve saturation. Extending the enquiry to
multi-site, cross-cultural research, Hagaman and Wutich
[28] showed that sample sizes of 20 to 40 interviews
were required to achieve data saturation of meta-themes
that cut across research sites. In a theory-driven content
analysis, Francis et al. [25] reached data saturation at the
17th interview for all their pre-determined theoretical
constructs. The authors further proposed two main prin-
ciples upon which specification of saturation be based:
(a) researchers should a priori specify an initial analysis
sample (e.g. 10 interviews) which will be used for the
first round of analysis and (b) a stopping criterion, that
is, a number of interviews (e.g. 3) that needs to be fur-
ther conducted, the analysis of which will not yield any
new themes or ideas. For greater transparency, Francis
et al. [25] recommend that researchers present cumula-
tive frequency graphs supporting their judgment that
saturation was achieved. A comparative method for
themes saturation (CoMeTS) has also been suggested
[23] whereby the findings of each new interview are
compared with those that have already emerged and if it
does not yield any new theme, the ‘saturated terrain’ is
assumed to have been established. Because the order in
which interviews are analysed can influence saturation
thresholds depending on the richness of the data, Con-
stantinou et al. [23] recommend reordering and re-ana-
lysing interviews to confirm saturation. Hennink, Kaiser
and Marconi’s [29] methodological study sheds further
light on the problem of specifying and demonstrating
saturation. Their analysis of interview data showed that
code saturation (i.e. the point at which no additional is-
sues are identified) was achieved at 9 interviews, but
meaning saturation (i.e. the point at which no further di-
mensions, nuances, or insights of issues are identified)
required 16–24 interviews. Although breadth can be
achieved relatively soon, especially for high-prevalence
and concrete codes, depth requires additional data, espe-
cially for codes of a more conceptual nature.
Critiquing the concept of saturation, Nelson [19] pro-
poses five conceptual depth criteria in grounded theory
projects to assess the robustness of the developing the-
ory: (a) theoretical concepts should be supported by a
wide range of evidence drawn from the data; (b) be dem-
onstrably part of a network of inter-connected concepts;
(c) demonstrate subtlety; (d) resonate with existing lit-
erature; and (e) can be successfully submitted to tests of
external validity.
Other work has sought to examine practices of sample
size reporting and sufficiency assessment across a range
of disciplinary fields and research domains, from nutri-
tion [34] and health education [32], to education and the
health sciences [22, 27], information systems [30], organ-
isation and workplace studies [33], human computer
interaction [21], and accounting studies [24]. Others
investigated PhD qualitative studies [31] and grounded
theory studies [35]. Incomplete and imprecise sample
size reporting is commonly pinpointed by these investi-
gations whilst assessment and justifications of sample
size sufficiency are even more sporadic.
Sobal [34] examined the sample size of qualitative
studies published in the Journal of Nutrition Education
over a period of 30 years. Studies that employed individ-
ual interviews (n = 30) had an average sample size of 45
individuals and none of these explicitly reported whether
their sample size sought and/or attained saturation. A
minority of articles discussed how sample-related limita-
tions (with the latter most often concerning the type of
sample, rather than the size) limited generalizability. A
further systematic analysis [32] of health education
Vasileiou et al. BMC Medical Research Methodology          (2018) 18:148 
Page 3 of 18
 research over 20 years demonstrated that interview-
based studies averaged 104 participants (range 2 to 720
interviewees). However, 40% did not report the number
of participants. An examination of 83 qualitative inter-
view studies in leading information systems journals [30]
indicated little defence of sample sizes on the basis of
recommendations by qualitative methodologists, prior
relevant work, or the criterion of saturation. Rather,
sample size seemed to correlate with factors such as the
journal of publication or the region of study (US vs
Europe vs Asia). These results led the authors to call for
more rigor in determining and reporting sample size in
qualitative information systems research and to recom-
mend optimal sample size ranges for grounded theory
(i.e. 20–30 interviews) and single case (i.e. 15–30 inter-
views) projects.
Similarly, fewer than 10% of articles in organisation
and workplace studies provided a sample size justifica-
tion relating to existing recommendations by methodol-
ogists, prior relevant work, or saturation [33], whilst
only 17% of focus groups studies in health-related jour-
nals provided an explanation of sample size (i.e. number
of
focus
groups),
with
saturation
being
the
most
frequently invoked argument, followed by published
sample size recommendations and practical reasons [22].
The notion of saturation was also invoked by 11 out of
the 51 most highly cited studies that Guetterman [27]
reviewed in the fields of education and health sciences,
of which six were grounded theory studies, four phe-
nomenological and one a narrative inquiry. Finally,
analysing 641 interview-based articles in accounting, Dai
et al. [24] called for more rigor since a significant minor-
ity of studies did not report precise sample size.
Despite increasing attention to rigor in qualitative
research (e.g. [52]) and more extensive methodological
and analytical disclosures that seek to validate qualitative
work [24], sample size reporting and sufficiency assess-
ment remain inconsistent and partial, if not absent,
across a range of research domains.
Objectives of the present study
The present study sought to enrich existing systematic
analyses of the customs and practices of sample size
reporting and justification by focusing on qualitative
research relating to health. Additionally, this study
attempted to expand previous empirical investigations
by examining how qualitative sample sizes are charac-
terised and discussed in academic narratives. Qualitative
health research is an inter-disciplinary field that due to
its affiliation with medical sciences, often faces views
and positions reflective of a quantitative ethos. Thus
qualitative health research constitutes an emblematic
case that may help to unfold underlying philosophical
and methodological differences across the scientific
community that are crystallised in considerations of sam-
ple size. The present research, therefore, incorporates a
comparative element on the basis of three different disci-
plines engaging with qualitative health research: medicine,
psychology, and sociology. We chose to focus our analysis
on single-per-participant-interview designs as this not
only presents a popular and widespread methodological
choice in qualitative health research, but also as the
method where consideration of sample size – defined as
the number of interviewees – is particularly salient.
Methods
Study design
A structured search for articles reporting cross-sectional,
interview-based qualitative studies was carried out and
eligible
reports
were
systematically
reviewed
and
analysed employing both quantitative and qualitative
analytic techniques.
We selected journals which (a) follow a peer review
process, (b) are considered high quality and influential in
their field as reflected in journal metrics, and (c) are recep-
tive to, and publish, qualitative research (Additional File 1
presents the journals’ editorial positions in relation to
qualitative research and sample considerations where
available). Three health-related journals were chosen,
each representing a different disciplinary field; the
British Medical Journal (BMJ) representing medicine,
the British Journal of Health Psychology (BJHP) repre-
senting psychology, and the Sociology of Health & Ill-
ness (SHI) representing sociology.
Search strategy to identify studies
Employing the
search
function
of
each
individual
journal, we used the terms ‘interview*’ AND ‘qualita-
tive’ and limited the results to articles published
between 1 January 2003 and 22 September 2017 (i.e.
a 15-year review period).
Eligibility criteria
To be eligible for inclusion in the review, the article
had to report a cross-sectional study design. Longitu-
dinal studies were thus excluded whilst studies con-
ducted within a broader research programme (e.g.
interview studies nested in a trial, as part of a broader
ethnography, as part of a longitudinal research) were
included if they reported only single-time qualitative
interviews. The method of data collection had to be in-
dividual, synchronous qualitative interviews (i.e. group
interviews, structured interviews and e-mail interviews
over a period of time were excluded), and the data had
to be analysed qualitatively (i.e. studies that quantified
their qualitative data were excluded). Mixed method
studies and articles reporting more than one qualitative
method of data collection (e.g. individual interviews
Vasileiou et al. BMC Medical Research Methodology          (2018) 18:148 
Page 4 of 18
 and focus groups) were excluded. Figure 1, a PRISMA
flow diagram [53], shows the number of: articles
obtained
from
the
searches
and
screened;
papers
assessed for eligibility; and articles included in the re-
view (Additional File 2 provides the full list of articles
included in the review and their unique identifying
code – e.g. BMJ01, BJHP02, SHI03). One review author
(KV) assessed the eligibility of all papers identified from
the searches. When in doubt, discussions about retain-
ing or excluding articles were held between KV and JB
in regular meetings, and decisions were jointly made.
Data extraction and analysis
A data extraction form was developed (see Additional File 3)
recording three areas of information: (a) information about
the article (e.g. authors, title, journal, year of publication
etc.); (b) information about the aims of the study, the sam-
ple size and any justification for this, the participant charac-
teristics, the sampling technique and any sample-related
observations or comments made by the authors; and (c)
information about the method or technique(s) of data ana-
lysis, the number of researchers involved in the analysis,
the potential use of software, and any discussion around
epistemological considerations. The Abstract, Methods and
Discussion (and/or Conclusion) sections of each article
were examined by one author (KV) who extracted all the
relevant information. This was directly copied from the
articles and, when appropriate, comments, notes and initial
thoughts were written down.
To examine the kinds of sample size justifications pro-
vided by articles, an inductive content analysis [54] was
initially conducted. On the basis of this analysis, the
categories that expressed qualitatively different sample
size justifications were developed.
We also extracted or coded quantitative data regarding
the following aspects:
– Journal and year of publication
– Number of interviews
– Number of participants
– Presence of sample size justification(s) (Yes/No)
– Presence of a particular sample size justification
category (Yes/No), and
– Number of sample size justifications provided
Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were
used to explore these data.
A thematic analysis [55] was then performed on all
scientific narratives that discussed or commented on the
sample size of the study. These narratives were evident
both in papers that justified their sample size and those
that did not. To identify these narratives, in addition to
the methods sections, the discussion sections of the
reviewed articles were also examined and relevant data
were extracted and analysed.
Results
In total, 214 articles – 21 in the BMJ, 53 in the BJHP and
140 in the SHI – were eligible for inclusion in the review.
Table 1 provides basic information about the sample sizes
– measured in number of interviews – of the studies
reviewed across the three journals. Figure 2 depicts the
number of eligible articles published each year per journal.
Pairwise comparisons following a significant Kruskal-
Wallis1 test indicated that the studies published in the
BJHP had significantly (p < .001) smaller samples sizes
than those published either in the BMJ or the SHI.
Sample sizes of BMJ and SHI articles did not differ sig-
nificantly from each other.
Sample size justifications: Results from the quantitative
and qualitative content analysis
Ten (47.6%) of the 21 BMJ studies, 26 (49.1%) of the 53
BJHP papers and 24 (17.1%) of the 140 SHI articles pro-
vided some sort of sample size justification. As shown in
Table 2, the majority of articles which justified their
sample size provided one justification (70% of articles);
fourteen studies (25%) provided two distinct justifica-
tions; one study (1.7%) gave three justifications and two
studies (3.3%) expressed four distinct justifications.
There was no association between the number of in-
terviews (i.e. sample size) conducted and the provision
of a justification (rpb = .054, p = .433). Within journals,
Mann-Whitney tests indicated that sample sizes of ‘jus-
tifying’ and ‘non-justifying’ articles in the BMJ and SHI
did not differ significantly from each other. In the BJHP,
‘justifying’ articles (Mean rank = 31.3) had significantly
larger sample sizes than ‘non-justifying’ studies (Mean
rank = 22.7; U = 237.000, p < .05).
There was a significant association between the jour-
nal a paper was published in and the provision of a justi-
fication (χ2 (2) = 23.83, p < .001). BJHP studies provided
a sample size justification significantly more often than
would be expected (z = 2.9); SHI studies significantly less
often (z = − 2.4). If an article was published in the BJHP,
the odds of providing a justification were 4.8 times
higher than if published in the SHI. Similarly if pub-
lished in the BMJ, the odds of a study justifying its sam-
ple size were 4.5 times higher than in the SHI.
The qualitative content analysis of the scientific narra-
tives identified eleven different sample size justifications.
These are described below and illustrated with excerpts
from relevant articles. By way of a summary, the fre-
quency with which these were deployed across the three
journals is indicated in Table 3.

 Saturation
Saturation was the most commonly invoked principle
(55.4% of all justifications) deployed by studies across all
three journals to justify the sufficiency of their sample
size. In the BMJ, two studies claimed that they achieved
data saturation (BMJ17; BMJ18) and one article referred
descriptively to achieving saturation without explicitly
using the term (BMJ13). Interestingly, BMJ13 included
data in the analysis beyond the point of saturation in
search of ‘unusual/deviant observations’ and with a view
to establishing findings consistency.
Thirty three women were approached to take part in
the interview study. Twenty seven agreed and 21 (aged
21–64, median 40) were interviewed before data
saturation was reached (one tape failure meant that
20 interviews were available for analysis). (BMJ17).
No new topics were identified following analysis of
approximately two thirds of the interviews; however,
all interviews were coded in order to develop a better
understanding of how characteristic the views and
reported behaviours were, and also to collect further
examples of unusual/deviant observations. (BMJ13).
Two articles reported pre-determining their sample
size with a view to achieving data saturation (BMJ08 –
see extract in section In line with existing research;
BMJ15 – see extract in section Pragmatic considerations)
without further specifying if this was achieved. One
paper claimed theoretical saturation (BMJ06) conceived
as being when “no further recurring themes emerging
from the analysis” whilst another study argued that al-
though the analytic categories were highly saturated, it
was not possible to determine whether theoretical satur-
ation had been achieved (BMJ04). One article (BMJ18)
cited a reference to support its position on saturation.
In the BJHP, six articles claimed that they achieved
data saturation (BJHP21; BJHP32; BJHP39; BJHP48;
BJHP49; BJHP52) and one article stated that, given their
sample size and the guidelines for achieving data satur-
ation, it anticipated that saturation would be attained
(BJHP50).
Recruitment continued until data saturation was
reached, defined as the point at which no new themes
emerged. (BJHP48).
It has previously been recommended that
qualitative studies require a minimum sample size
of at least 12 to reach data saturation (Clarke &
Braun, 2013; Fugard & Potts, 2014; Guest, Bunce,
& Johnson, 2006) Therefore, a sample of 13 was
deemed sufficient for the qualitative analysis and
scale of this study. (BJHP50).
Two studies argued that they achieved thematic
saturation (BJHP28 – see extract in section Sample
size guidelines; BJHP31) and one (BJHP30) article,
explicitly
concerned
with
theory
development
and
deploying theoretical sampling, claimed both theoret-
ical and data saturation.

 The final sample size was determined by thematic
saturation, the point at which new data appears
to no longer contribute to the findings due to
repetition of themes and comments by participants
(Morse, 1995). At this point, data generation was
terminated. (BJHP31).
Five studies argued that they achieved (BJHP05;
BJHP33; BJHP40; BJHP13 – see extract in section
Pragmatic considerations) or anticipated (BJHP46) sat-
uration without any further specification of the term.
BJHP17 referred descriptively to a state of achieved
saturation without specifically using the term. Satur-
ation of coding, but not saturation of themes, was
claimed to have been reached by one article (BJHP18).
Two articles explicitly stated that they did not achieve
saturation; instead claiming a level of theme complete-
ness
(BJHP27)
or
that
themes
being
replicated
(BJHP53) were arguments for sufficiency of their sam-
ple size.
Furthermore, data collection ceased on pragmatic
grounds rather than at the point when saturation
point was reached. Despite this, although nuances
within sub-themes were still emerging towards
the end of data analysis, the themes themselves were
being replicated indicating a level of
completeness. (BJHP27).
Finally, one article criticised and explicitly renounced
the notion of data saturation claiming that, on the con-
trary, the criterion of theoretical sufficiency determined
its sample size (BJHP16).
According to the original Grounded Theory texts,
data collection should continue until there are no
new discoveries (i.e., ‘data saturation’; Glaser &
Strauss, 1967). However, recent revisions of this
process have discussed how it is rare that data
collection is an exhaustive process and researchers
should rely on how well their data are able to
create a sufficient theoretical account or
‘theoretical sufficiency’ (Dey, 1999). For this study,
it was decided that theoretical sufficiency would
guide recruitment, rather than looking for data
saturation. (BJHP16).

 Ten out of the 20 BJHP articles that employed the argu-
ment of saturation used one or more citations relating to
this principle.
In the SHI, one article (SHI01) claimed that it achieved
category saturation based on authors’ judgment.
This number was not fixed in advance, but was guided
by the sampling strategy and the judgement, based on
the analysis of the data, of the point at which ‘category
saturation’ was achieved. (SHI01).
Three articles described a state of achieved saturation
without using the term or specifying what sort of satur-
ation they had achieved (i.e. data, theoretical, thematic
saturation) (SHI04; SHI13; SHI30) whilst another four
articles explicitly stated that they achieved saturation
(SHI100; SHI125; SHI136; SHI137). Two papers stated
that they achieved data saturation (SHI73 – see extract
in section Sample size guidelines; SHI113), two claimed
theoretical saturation (SHI78; SHI115) and two referred
to achieving thematic saturation (SHI87; SHI139) or to
saturated themes (SHI29; SHI50).
Recruitment and analysis ceased once theoretical
saturation was reached in the categories described
below (Lincoln and Guba 1985). (SHI115).
The respondents’ quotes drawn on below were chosen
as representative, and illustrate saturated themes.
(SHI50).
One article stated that thematic saturation was
anticipated with its sample size (SHI94). Briefly refer-
ring to the difficulty in pinpointing achievement of
theoretical saturation, SHI32 (see extract in section
Richness and volume of data) defended the sufficiency
of its sample size on the basis of “the high degree of
consensus [that] had begun to emerge among those
interviewed”, suggesting that information from inter-
views was being replicated. Finally, SHI112 (see ex-
tract in section Further sampling to check findings
consistency) argued that it achieved saturation of dis-
cursive patterns. Seven of the 19 SHI articles cited ref-
erences to support their position on saturation (see
Additional File 4 for the full list of citations used by
articles to support their position on saturation across
the three journals).
Overall, it is clear that the concept of saturation
encompassed a wide range of variants expressed in
terms such as saturation, data saturation, thematic satur-
ation, theoretical saturation, category saturation, satur-
ation of coding, saturation of discursive themes, theme
completeness. It is noteworthy, however, that although
these various claims were sometimes supported with
reference to the literature, they were not evidenced in
relation to the study at hand.
Pragmatic considerations
The determination of sample size on the basis of prag-
matic considerations was the second most frequently in-
voked argument (9.6% of all justifications) appearing in all
three journals. In the BMJ, one article (BMJ15) appealed
to pragmatic reasons, relating to time constraints and the
difficulty to access certain study populations, to justify the
determination of its sample size.
On the basis of the researchers’ previous
experience and the literature,
[30, 31]
we
estimated that recruitment of 15–20 patients at
each site would achieve data saturation when
data from each site were analysed separately.
We set a target of seven to 10 caregivers per site
because of time constraints and the anticipated
difficulty of accessing caregivers at some home
based care services. This gave a target sample
of 75–100 patients and 35–50 caregivers
overall. (BMJ15).
In the BJHP, four articles mentioned pragmatic con-
siderations relating to time or financial constraints
(BJHP27 – see extract in section Saturation; BJHP53),
the participant response rate (BJHP13), and the fixed
(and thus limited) size of the participant pool from
which interviewees were sampled (BJHP18).
We had aimed to continue interviewing until
we had reached saturation, a point whereby
further data collection would yield no further
themes. In practice, the number of individuals
volunteering to participate dictated when
recruitment into the study ceased (15 young
people, 15 parents). Nonetheless, by the last
few interviews, significant repetition of
concepts was occurring, suggesting ample
sampling. (BJHP13).
Finally, three SHI articles explained their sample size
with reference to practical aspects: time constraints and
project manageability (SHI56), limited availability of
respondents and project resources (SHI131), and time
constraints (SHI113).
The size of the sample was largely determined by
the availability of respondents and resources to
complete the study. Its composition reflected, as
far as practicable, our interest in how contextual
factors (for example, gender relations and ethnicity)
mediated the illness experience. (SHI131).

 Qualities of the analysis
This sample size justification (8.4% of all justifications)
was mainly employed by BJHP articles and referred to
an intensive, idiographic and/or latently focused analysis,
i.e. that moved beyond description. More specifically, six
articles defended their sample size on the basis of an in-
tensive analysis of transcripts and/or the idiographic
focus
of
the
study/analysis.
Four
of
these
papers
(BJHP02; BJHP19; BJHP24; BJHP47) adopted an Inter-
pretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) approach.
The current study employed a sample of 10 in keeping
with the aim of exploring each participant’s account
(Smith et al., 1999). (BJHP19).
BJHP47 explicitly renounced the notion of saturation
within an IPA approach. The other two BJHP articles
conducted thematic analysis (BJHP34; BJHP38). The
level of analysis – i.e. latent as opposed to a more super-
ficial descriptive analysis – was also invoked as a justifi-
cation
by
BJHP38
alongside
the
argument
of
an
intensive analysis of individual transcripts
The resulting sample size was at the lower end of the
range of sample sizes employed in thematic analysis
(Braun & Clarke, 2013). This was in order to enable
significant reflection, dialogue, and time on each
transcript and was in line with the more latent level of
analysis employed, to identify underlying ideas, rather
than a more superficial descriptive analysis (Braun &
Clarke, 2006). (BJHP38).
Finally, one BMJ paper (BMJ21) defended its sample
size with reference to the complexity of the analytic task.
We stopped recruitment when we reached 30–35
interviews, owing to the depth and duration of
interviews, richness of data, and complexity of the
analytical task. (BMJ21).
Meet sampling requirements
Meeting sampling requirements (7.2% of all justifications)
was another argument employed by two BMJ and four
SHI articles to explain their sample size. Achieving max-
imum variation sampling in terms of specific interviewee
characteristics determined and explained the sample size
of two BMJ studies (BMJ02; BMJ16 – see extract in sec-
tion Meet research design requirements).
Recruitment continued until sampling frame
requirements were met for diversity in age, sex,
ethnicity, frequency of attendance, and health
status. (BMJ02).
Regarding the SHI articles, two papers explained
their numbers on the basis of their sampling strategy
(SHI01- see extract in
section Saturation; SHI23)
whilst sampling requirements that would help attain
sample heterogeneity in terms of a particular charac-
teristic of interest was cited by one paper (SHI127).
The combination of matching the recruitment sites
for the quantitative research and the additional
purposive criteria led to 104 phase 2 interviews
(Internet (OLC): 21; Internet (FTF): 20); Gyms
(FTF): 23; HIV testing (FTF): 20; HIV treatment
(FTF): 20.) (SHI23).
Of the fifty interviews conducted, thirty were
translated from Spanish into English. These
thirty, from which we draw our findings, were
chosen for translation based on heterogeneity in
depressive symptomology and educational
attainment. (SHI127).
Finally, the pre-determination of sample size on the
basis of sampling requirements was stated by one article
though this was not used to justify the number of inter-
views (SHI10).
Sample size guidelines
Five BJHP articles (BJHP28; BJHP38 – see extract in
section Qualities of the analysis; BJHP46; BJHP47;
BJHP50 – see extract in section Saturation) and one
SHI paper (SHI73) relied on citing existing sample
size guidelines or norms within research traditions to
determine and subsequently defend their sample size
(7.2% of all justifications).
Sample size guidelines suggested a range
between 20 and 30 interviews to be adequate
(Creswell, 1998). Interviewer and note taker
agreed that thematic saturation, the point at
which no new concepts emerge from subsequent
interviews (Patton, 2002), was achieved following
completion of 20 interviews. (BJHP28).
Interviewing continued until we deemed data
saturation to have been reached (the point at
which no new themes were emerging). Researchers
have proposed 30 as an approximate or working
number of interviews at which one could expect
to be reaching theoretical saturation when using
a semi-structured interview approach (Morse
2000), although this can vary depending on
the heterogeneity of respondents interviewed
and complexity of the issues explored. (SHI73).

 In line with existing research
Sample sizes of published literature in the area of the
subject matter under investigation (3.5% of all justifica-
tions) were used by 2 BMJ articles as guidance and a
precedent for determining and defending their own sam-
ple size (BMJ08; BMJ15 – see extract in section Prag-
matic considerations).
We drew participants from a list of prisoners who were
scheduled for release each week, sampling them until
we reached the target of 35 cases, with a view to
achieving data saturation within the scope of the study
and sufficient follow-up interviews and in line with re-
cent studies [8–10]. (BMJ08).
Similarly, BJHP38 (see extract in section Qualities of
the analysis) claimed that its sample size was within the
range of sample sizes of published studies that use its
analytic approach.
Richness and volume of data
BMJ21 (see extract in section Qualities of the analysis)
and SHI32 referred to the richness, detailed nature, and
volume of data collected (2.3% of all justifications) to
justify the sufficiency of their sample size.
Although there were more potential interviewees from
those contacted by postcode selection, it was decided to
stop recruitment after the 10th interview and focus on
analysis of this sample. The material collected was
considerable and, given the focused nature of the
study, extremely detailed. Moreover, a high degree of
consensus had begun to emerge among those
interviewed, and while it is always difficult to judge at
what point ‘theoretical saturation’ has been reached,
or how many interviews would be required to uncover
exception(s), it was felt the number was sufficient to
satisfy the aims of this small in-depth investigation
(Strauss and Corbin 1990). (SHI32).
Meet research design requirements
Determination of sample size so that it is in line with,
and serves the requirements of, the research design
(2.3% of all justifications) that the study adopted was an-
other justification used by 2 BMJ papers (BMJ16; BMJ08
– see extract in section In line with existing research).
We aimed for diverse, maximum variation samples
[20] totalling 80 respondents from different social
backgrounds and ethnic groups and those bereaved
due to different types of suicide and traumatic death.
We could have interviewed a smaller sample at
different points in time (a qualitative longitudinal
study) but chose instead to seek a broad range of
experiences by interviewing those bereaved many years
ago and others bereaved more recently; those bereaved
in different circumstances and with different relations
to the deceased; and people who lived in different
parts of the UK; with different support systems and
coroners’ procedures (see Tables 1 and 2 for more
details). (BMJ16).
Researchers’ previous experience
The researchers’ previous experience (possibly referring
to experience with qualitative research) was invoked by
BMJ15 (see extract in section Pragmatic considerations)
as a justification for the determination of sample size.
Nature of study
One BJHP paper argued that the sample size was appro-
priate for the exploratory nature of the study (BJHP38).
A sample of eight participants was deemed
appropriate because of the exploratory nature of this
research and the focus on identifying underlying ideas
about the topic. (BJHP38).
Further sampling to check findings consistency
Finally, SHI112 argued that once it had achieved sat-
uration of discursive patterns, further sampling was
decided and conducted to check for consistency of
the findings.
Within each of the age-stratified groups,
interviews were randomly sampled until
saturation of discursive patterns was achieved.
This resulted in a sample of 67 interviews.
Once this sample had been analysed, one
further interview from each age-stratified group
was randomly chosen to check for consistency
of the findings. Using this approach it was
possible to more carefully explore children’s
discourse about the ‘I’, agency, relationality
and power in the thematic areas, revealing
the subtle discursive variations described in
this article. (SHI112).
Thematic analysis of passages discussing sample size
This analysis resulted in two overarching thematic areas;
the first concerned the variation in the characterisation of
sample size sufficiency, and the second related to the per-
ceived threats deriving from sample size insufficiency.

 Characterisations of sample size sufficiency
The analysis showed that there were three main charac-
terisations of the sample size in the articles that provided
relevant comments and discussion: (a) the vast majority
of these qualitative studies (n = 42) considered their
sample size as ‘small’ and this was seen and discussed as
a limitation; only two articles viewed their small sample
size as desirable and appropriate (b) a minority of arti-
cles (n = 4) proclaimed that their achieved sample size
was ‘sufficient’; and (c) finally, a small group of studies
(n = 5) characterised their sample size as ‘large’. Whilst
achieving a ‘large’ sample size was sometimes viewed
positively because it led to richer results, there were also
occasions when a large sample size was problematic
rather than desirable.
‘Small’ but why and for whom? A number of articles
which characterised their sample size as ‘small’ did so
against an implicit or explicit quantitative framework
of reference. Interestingly, three studies that claimed
to have achieved data saturation or ‘theoretical suffi-
ciency’ with their sample size, discussed or noted as a
limitation in their discussion their ‘small’ sample size,
raising the question of why, or for whom, the sample
size was considered small given that the qualitative
criterion of saturation had been satisfied.
The current study has a number of limitations. The
sample size was small (n = 11) and, however, large
enough for no new themes to emerge. (BJHP39).
The study has two principal limitations. The first of
these relates to the small number of respondents who
took part in the study. (SHI73).
Other articles appeared to accept and acknowledge that
their sample was flawed because of its small size (as well as
other compositional ‘deficits’ e.g. non-representativeness,
biases, self-selection) or anticipated that they might be criti-
cized for their small sample size. It seemed that the imag-
ined audience – perhaps reviewer or reader – was one
inclined to hold the tenets of quantitative research, and
certainly one to whom it was important to indicate the
recognition that small samples were likely to be problem-
atic. That one’s sample might be thought small was often
construed as a limitation couched in a discourse of regret
or apology.
Very occasionally, the articulation of the small size
as a limitation was explicitly aligned against an es-
poused positivist framework and quantitative research.
This study has some limitations. Firstly, the 100
incidents sample represents a small number of the
total number of serious incidents that occurs every
year.26 We sent out a nationwide invitation and do
not know why more people did not volunteer for the
study. Our lack of epidemiological knowledge about
healthcare incidents, however, means that determining
an appropriate sample size continues to be difficult.
(BMJ20).
Indicative of an apparent oscillation of qualitative re-
searchers between the different requirements and proto-
cols demarcating the quantitative and qualitative worlds,
there were a few instances of articles which briefly
recognised their ‘small’ sample size as a limitation, but
then defended their study on more qualitative grounds,
such as their ability and success at capturing the com-
plexity of experience and delving into the idiographic,
and at generating particularly rich data.
This research, while limited in size, has sought to
capture some of the complexity attached to men’s
attitudes and experiences concerning incomes and
material circumstances. (SHI35).
Our numbers are small because negotiating access to
social networks was slow and labour intensive, but our
methods generated exceptionally rich data. (BMJ21).
This study could be criticised for using a small and
unrepresentative sample. Given that older adults have
been ignored in the research concerning suntanning,
fair-skinned older adults are the most likely to experi-
ence skin cancer, and women privilege appearance over
health when it comes to sunbathing practices, our
study offers depth and richness of data in a demo-
graphic group much in need of research attention.
(SHI57).
‘Good
enough’
sample
sizes
Only
four
articles
expressed some degree of confidence that their achieved
sample size was sufficient. For example, SHI139, in line
with the justification of thematic saturation that it of-
fered, expressed trust in its sample size sufficiency des-
pite the poor response rate. Similarly, BJHP04, which
did not provide a sample size justification, argued that it
targeted a larger sample size in order to eventually re-
cruit a sufficient number of interviewees, due to antici-
pated low response rate.
Twenty-three people with type I diabetes from the
target population of 133 (i.e. 17.3%) consented to
participate but four did not then respond to further
contacts (total N = 19). The relatively low response
rate was anticipated, due to the busy life-styles of
young people in the age range, the geographical
Vasileiou et al. BMC Medical Research Methodology          (2018) 18:148 
Page 12 of 18
 constraints, and the time required to participate in a
semi-structured interview, so a larger target sample
allowed a sufficient number of participants to be re-
cruited. (BJHP04).
Two other articles (BJHP35; SHI32) linked the claimed
sufficiency to the scope (i.e. ‘small, in-depth investiga-
tion’), aims and nature (i.e. ‘exploratory’) of their studies,
thus anchoring their numbers to the particular context
of their research. Nevertheless, claims of sample size suf-
ficiency were sometimes undermined when they were
juxtaposed with an acknowledgement that a larger sam-
ple size would be more scientifically productive.
Although our sample size was sufficient for this
exploratory study, a more diverse sample including
participants with lower socioeconomic status and more
ethnic variation would be informative. A larger sample
could also ensure inclusion of a more representative
range of apps operating on a wider range of platforms.
(BJHP35).
‘Large’ sample sizes - Promise or peril? Three articles
(BMJ13; BJHP05; BJHP48) which all provided the justifi-
cation of saturation, characterised their sample size as
‘large’ and narrated this oversufficiency in positive terms
as it allowed richer data and findings and enhanced the
potential for generalisation. The type of generalisation
aspired to (BJHP48) was not further specified however.
This study used rich data provided by a relatively
large sample of expert informants on an important but
under-researched topic. (BMJ13).
Qualitative research provides a unique opportunity to
understand a clinical problem from the patient’s
perspective. This study had a large diverse sample,
recruited through a range of locations and used in-
depth interviews which enhance the richness and
generalizability of the results. (BJHP48).
And whilst a ‘large’ sample size was endorsed and valued
by some qualitative researchers, within the psychological
tradition of IPA, a ‘large’ sample size was counter-norma-
tive and therefore needed to be justified. Four BJHP stud-
ies, all adopting IPA, expressed the appropriateness or
desirability of ‘small’ sample sizes (BJHP41; BJHP45) or
hastened to explain why they included a larger than typ-
ical sample size (BJHP32; BJHP47). For example, BJHP32
below provides a rationale for how an IPA study can ac-
commodate a large sample size and how this was indeed
suitable for the purposes of the particular research. To
strengthen the explanation for choosing a non-normative
sample size, previous IPA research citing a similar sample
size approach is used as a precedent.
Small scale IPA studies allow in-depth analysis which
would not be possible with larger samples (Smith et
al., 2009). (BJHP41).
Although IPA generally involves intense scrutiny of a
small number of transcripts, it was decided to recruit
a larger diverse sample as this is the first qualitative
study of this population in the United Kingdom (as far
as we know) and we wanted to gain an overview.
Indeed, Smith, Flowers, and Larkin (2009) agree that
IPA is suitable for larger groups. However, the
emphasis changes from an in-depth individualistic
analysis to one in which common themes from shared
experiences of a group of people can be elicited and
used to understand the network of relationships
between themes that emerge from the interviews. This
large-scale format of IPA has been used by other
researchers in the field of false-positive research.
Baillie, Smith, Hewison, and Mason (2000) conducted
an IPA study, with 24 participants, of ultrasound
screening for chromosomal abnormality; they found
that this larger number of participants enabled
them to produce a more refined and cohesive
account. (BJHP32).
The IPA articles found in the BJHP were the only in-
stances where a ‘small’ sample size was advocated and a
‘large’ sample size problematized and defended. These
IPA studies illustrate that the characterisation of sample
size sufficiency can be a function of researchers’ theoret-
ical and epistemological commitments rather than the
result of an ‘objective’ sample size assessment.
Threats from sample size insufficiency
As shown above, the majority of articles that commen-
ted on their sample size, simultaneously characterized it
as small and problematic. On those occasions that au-
thors did not simply cite their ‘small’ sample size as a
study limitation but rather continued and provided an
account of how and why a small sample size was prob-
lematic, two important scientific qualities of the research
seemed to be threatened: the generalizability and validity
of results.
Generalizability
Those who characterised their sample as ‘small’ con-
nected this to the limited potential for generalization of
the results. Other features related to the sample – often
some kind of compositional particularity – were also
linked to limited potential for generalisation. Though not
always explicitly articulated to what form of generalisation
Vasileiou et al. BMC Medical Research Methodology          (2018) 18:148 
Page 13 of 18
 the articles referred to (see BJHP09), generalisation was
mostly conceived in nomothetic terms, that is, it con-
cerned the potential to draw inferences from the sample
to the broader study population (‘representational general-
isation’ – see BJHP31) and less often to other populations
or cultures.
It must be noted that samples are small and whilst in
both groups the majority of those women eligible
participated, generalizability cannot be assumed.
(BJHP09).
The study’s limitations should be acknowledged: Data
are presented from interviews with a relatively small
group of participants, and thus, the views are not
necessarily generalizable to all patients and clinicians.
In particular, patients were only recruited from
secondary care services where COFP diagnoses are
typically confirmed. The sample therefore is unlikely to
represent the full spectrum of patients, particularly
those who are not referred to, or who have been
discharged from dental services. (BJHP31).
Without explicitly using the term generalisation,
two SHI articles noted how their ‘small’ sample size
imposed limits on ‘the extent that we can extrapolate
from these participants’ accounts’ (SHI114) or to the
possibility ‘to draw far-reaching conclusions from the
results’ (SHI124).
Interestingly, only a minority of articles alluded to, or
invoked, a type of generalisation that is aligned with
qualitative research, that is, idiographic generalisation
(i.e. generalisation that can be made from and about
cases [5]). These articles, all published in the discipline
of sociology, defended their findings in terms of the pos-
sibility of drawing logical and conceptual inferences to
other contexts and of generating understanding that has
the potential to advance knowledge, despite their ‘small’
size. One article (SHI139) clearly contrasted nomothetic
(statistical) generalisation to idiographic generalisation,
arguing that the lack of statistical generalizability does
not nullify the ability of qualitative research to still be
relevant beyond the sample studied.
Further, these data do not need to be statistically
generalisable for us to draw inferences that may
advance medicalisation analyses (Charmaz 2014).
These data may be seen as an opportunity to generate
further hypotheses and are a unique application of the
medicalisation framework. (SHI139).
Although a small-scale qualitative study related to
school counselling, this analysis can be usefully
regarded as a case study of the successful utilisation
of mental health-related resources by adolescents. As
many of the issues explored are of relevance to
mental health stigma more generally, it may also
provide insights into adult engagement in services. It
shows how a sociological analysis, which uses
positioning theory to examine how people negotiate,
partially accept and simultaneously resist
stigmatisation in relation to mental health concerns,
can contribute to an elucidation of the social processes
and narrative constructions which may maintain as
well as bridge the mental health service gap. (SHI103).
Only one article (SHI30) used the term transferability
to argue for the potential of wider relevance of the re-
sults which was thought to be more the product of the
composition of the sample (i.e. diverse sample), rather
than the sample size.
Validity
The second major concern that arose from a ‘small’ sam-
ple size pertained to the internal validity of findings (i.e.
here the term is used to denote the ‘truth’ or credibility
of research findings). Authors expressed uncertainty
about the degree of confidence in particular aspects or
patterns of their results, primarily those that concerned
some form of differentiation on the basis of relevant par-
ticipant characteristics.
The information source preferred seemed to vary
according to parents’ education; however, the sample
size is too small to draw conclusions about such
patterns. (SHI80).
Although our numbers were too small to
demonstrate gender differences with any certainty, it
does seem that the biomedical and erotic scripts
may be more common in the accounts of men and
the relational script more common in the accounts
of women. (SHI81).
In other instances, articles expressed uncertainty about
whether their results accounted for the full spectrum
and variation of the phenomenon under investigation. In
other words, a ‘small’ sample size (alongside compos-
itional ‘deficits’ such as a not statistically representative
sample) was seen to threaten the ‘content validity’ of the
results which in turn led to constructions of the study
conclusions as tentative.
Data collection ceased on pragmatic grounds rather
than when no new information appeared to be
obtained (i.e., saturation point). As such, care should
be taken not to overstate the findings. Whilst the
themes from the initial interviews seemed to be
Vasileiou et al. BMC Medical Research Methodology          (2018) 18:148 
Page 14 of 18
 replicated in the later interviews, further interviews
may have identified additional themes or provided
more nuanced explanations. (BJHP53).
…it should be acknowledged that this study was based
on a small sample of self-selected couples in enduring
marriages who were not broadly representative of the
population. Thus, participants may not be representa-
tive of couples that experience postnatal PTSD. It is
therefore unlikely that all the key themes have been
identified and explored. For example, couples who
were excluded from the study because the male part-
ner declined to participate may have been experien-
cing greater interpersonal difficulties. (BJHP03).
In other instances, articles attempted to preserve a de-
gree of credibility of their results, despite the recognition
that the sample size was ‘small’. Clarity and sharpness of
emerging themes and alignment with previous relevant
work were the arguments employed to warrant the valid-
ity of the results.
This study focused on British Chinese carers of
patients with affective disorders, using a qualitative
methodology to synthesise the sociocultural
representations of illness within this community.
Despite the small sample size, clear themes emerged
from the narratives that were sufficient for this
exploratory investigation. (SHI98).
Discussion
The present study sought to examine how qualitative
sample sizes in health-related research are characterised
and justified. In line with previous studies [22, 30, 33,
34] the findings demonstrate that reporting of sample
size sufficiency is limited; just over 50% of articles in the
BMJ and BJHP and 82% in the SHI did not provide any
sample size justification. Providing a sample size justifi-
cation was not related to the number of interviews con-
ducted, but it was associated with the journal that the
article was published in, indicating the influence of dis-
ciplinary or publishing norms, also reported in prior re-
search [30]. This lack of transparency about sample size
sufficiency is problematic given that most qualitative re-
searchers would agree that it is an important marker of
quality [56, 57]. Moreover, and with the rise of qualita-
tive research in social sciences, efforts to synthesise
existing evidence and assess its quality are obstructed by
poor reporting [58, 59].
When authors justified their sample size, our findings
indicate that sufficiency was mostly appraised with refer-
ence to features that were intrinsic to the study, in agree-
ment with general advice on sample size determination [4,
11, 36]. The principle of saturation was the most com-
monly invoked argument [22] accounting for 55% of all
justifications. A wide range of variants of saturation was
evident corroborating the proliferation of the meaning of
the term [49] and reflecting different underlying concep-
tualisations or models of saturation [20]. Nevertheless,
claims of saturation were never substantiated in relation
to procedures conducted in the study itself, endorsing
similar observations in the literature [25, 30, 47]. Claims
of saturation were sometimes supported with citations
of other literature, suggesting a removal of the concept
away from the characteristics of the study at hand.
Pragmatic considerations, such as resource constraints
or participant response rate and availability, was the
second most frequently used argument accounting for
approximately 10% of justifications and another 23% of
justifications
also
represented
intrinsic-to-the-study
characteristics (i.e. qualities of the analysis, meeting
sampling or research design requirements, richness and
volume of the data obtained, nature of study, further
sampling to check findings consistency).
Only, 12% of mentions of sample size justification per-
tained to arguments that were external to the study at
hand, in the form of existing sample size guidelines and
prior research that sets precedents. Whilst community
norms and prior research can establish useful rules of
thumb for estimating sample sizes [60] – and reveal what
sizes are more likely to be acceptable within research
communities – researchers should avoid adopting these
norms uncritically, especially when such guidelines [e.g.
30, 35], might be based on research that does not provide
adequate evidence of sample size sufficiency. Similarly,
whilst methodological research that seeks to demonstrate
the achievement of saturation is invaluable since it expli-
cates the parameters upon which saturation is contingent
and indicates when a research project is likely to require a
smaller or a larger sample [e.g. 29], specific numbers at
which saturation was achieved within these projects can-
not be routinely extrapolated for other projects. We con-
cur with existing views [11, 36] that the consideration of
the characteristics of the study at hand, such as the epis-
temological and theoretical approach, the nature of the
phenomenon under investigation, the aims and scope of
the study, the quality and richness of data, or the re-
searcher’s experience and skills of conducting qualitative
research, should be the primary guide in determining sam-
ple size and assessing its sufficiency.
Moreover, although numbers in qualitative research
are not unimportant [61], sample size should not be
considered alone but be embedded in the more encom-
passing examination of data adequacy [56, 57]. Erickson’s
[62] dimensions of ‘evidentiary adequacy’ are useful here.
He explains the concept in terms of adequate amounts of
evidence, adequate variety in kinds of evidence, adequate
Vasileiou et al. BMC Medical Research Methodology          (2018) 18:148

 interpretive status of evidence, adequate disconfirming
evidence, and adequate discrepant case analysis. All di-
mensions might not be relevant across all qualitative re-
search designs, but this illustrates the thickness of the
concept of data adequacy, taking it beyond sample size.
The present research also demonstrated that sample
sizes were commonly seen as ‘small’ and insufficient
and discussed as limitation. Often unjustified (and in
two cases incongruent with their own claims of satur-
ation) these findings imply that sample size in qualita-
tive health research is often adversely judged (or
expected to be judged) against an implicit, yet omni-
present, quasi-quantitative standpoint. Indeed there
were a few instances in our data where authors ap-
peared, possibly in response to reviewers, to resist to
some sort of quantification of their results. This impli-
cit reference point became more apparent when au-
thors discussed the threats deriving from an insufficient
sample size. Whilst the concerns about internal validity
might be legitimate to the extent that qualitative re-
search projects, which are broadly related to realism,
are set to examine phenomena in sufficient breadth and
depth, the concerns around generalizability revealed a
conceptualisation that is not compatible with purposive
sampling. The limited potential for generalisation, as a
result of a small sample size, was often discussed in
nomothetic, statistical terms. Only occasionally was
analytic or idiographic generalisation invoked to war-
rant the value of the study’s findings [5, 17].
Strengths and limitations of the present study
We note, first, the limited number of health-related
journals reviewed, so that only a ‘snapshot’ of qualitative
health research has been captured. Examining additional
disciplines (e.g. nursing sciences) as well as inter-discip-
linary journals would add to the findings of this analysis.
Nevertheless, our study is the first to provide some com-
parative insights on the basis of disciplines that are dif-
ferently
attached
to
the
legacy
of
positivism
and
analysed literature published over a lengthy period of
time
(15
years).
Guetterman
[27]
also
examined
health-related literature but this analysis was restricted
to 26 most highly cited articles published over a period
of five years whilst Carlsen and Glenton’s [22] study
concentrated on focus groups health research. Moreover,
although it was our intention to examine sample size
justification in relation to the epistemological and theor-
etical positions of articles, this proved to be challenging
largely due to absence of relevant information, or the
difficulty into discerning clearly articles’ positions [63] and
classifying them under specific approaches (e.g. studies
often combined elements from different theoretical and
epistemological traditions). We believe that such an analysis
would yield useful insights as it links the methodological
issue of sample size to the broader philosophical stance of
the research. Despite these limitations, the analysis of the
characterisation of sample size and of the threats seen to
accrue from insufficient sample size, enriches our under-
standing of sample size (in)sufficiency argumentation by
linking it to other features of the research. As the peer-re-
view process becomes increasingly public, future research
could usefully examine how reporting around sample size
sufficiency and data adequacy might be influenced by the
interactions between authors and reviewers.
Conclusions
The past decade has seen a growing appetite in qualitative
research for an evidence-based approach to sample size
determination and to evaluations of the sufficiency of sam-
ple size. Despite the conceptual and methodological devel-
opments in the area, the findings of the present study
confirm previous studies in concluding that appraisals of
sample size sufficiency are either absent or poorly substan-
tiated. To ensure and maintain high quality research that
will encourage greater appreciation of qualitative work in
health-related sciences [64], we argue that qualitative re-
searchers should be more transparent and thorough in their
evaluation of sample size as part of their appraisal of data
adequacy. We would encourage the practice of appraising
sample size sufficiency with close reference to the study at
hand and would thus caution against responding to the
growing methodological research in this area with a decon-
textualised application of sample size numerical guidelines,
norms and principles. Although researchers might find
sample size community norms serve as useful rules of
thumb, we recommend methodological knowledge is used
to critically consider how saturation and other parameters
that affect sample size sufficiency pertain to the specifics of
the particular project. Those reviewing papers have a vital
role in encouraging transparent study-specific reporting.
The review process should support authors to exercise nu-
anced judgments in decisions about sample size determin-
ation in the context of the range of factors that influence
sample size sufficiency and the specifics of a particular
study. In light of the growing methodological evidence in
the area, transparent presentation of such evidence-based
judgement is crucial and in time should surely obviate the
seemingly routine practice of citing the ‘small’ size of quali-
tative samples among the study limitations.
