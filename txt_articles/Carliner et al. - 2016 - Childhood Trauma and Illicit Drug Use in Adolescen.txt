Abstract
 Objective—Although potentially traumatic events (PTEs) are established risk factors for 
substance use disorders among adults, little is known about associations with drug use during 
adolescence, an important developmental stage for drug use prevention. We examined whether 
childhood PTEs were associated with illicit drug use among a representative sample of US 
adolescents.
 Method—Data were drawn from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication–Adolescent 
Supplement (NCS-A), which included adolescents aged 13-18 years (N=9,956). Weighted logistic 
regression models estimated risk ratios for lifetime use of marijuana, cocaine, nonmedical 
prescription drugs, other drugs, and multiple drugs.

  Results—Exposure to any PTE prior to age 11 was reported by 36% of the sample and was 
associated with higher risk for use of marijuana (risk ratio [RR] = 1.50), cocaine (RR = 2.78), 
prescription drugs (RR=1.80), other drugs (RR=1.90), and multiple drugs (RR=1.74). A positive 
monotonic relationship was observed between number of PTEs and marijuana, other drug, and 
multiple drug use. Interpersonal violence was associated with all drug use outcomes. Accidents 
and unspecified events were associated with higher risk for marijuana, cocaine, and prescription 
drug use.
 Conclusion—Potentially traumatic events in childhood are associated with risk for illicit drug 
use among US adolescents. These findings add to the literature by illustrating a potentially 
modifiable health behavior that may be a target for intervention; and that adolescents with a 
trauma history are a high-risk group for illicit drug use and may benefit from trauma-focused 
prevention efforts that specifically address traumatic memories and coping strategies for dealing 
with stressful life events.

 INTRODUCTION
The average age of first use of illicit drugs is during late adolescence to early adulthood,1 
making adolescence an important developmental stage for education and interventions to 
prevent substance use and disorders.1,2 In particular, earlier age at initiation and patterns of 
substance use in adolescence may have a lasting influence on substance use and disorders 
across the life course.3,4 In order to develop and provide effective drug prevention 
programming to youth, it is necessary to identify adolescents at particularly high risk for 
illicit drug use5,6 and to investigate the factors that create this higher risk.
Although potentially traumatic events (PTEs) in childhood are established risk factors for 
substance use disorders in adults,7-12 scant research has examined the associations of 
childhood PTEs with initiation of substance use in adolescence. To our knowledge, only four 
previous studies explicitly examined the role of family adversity and maltreatment on 
substance use in adolescence. Taken together, these studies reported that aspects of family 
adversity were associated with earlier age of drug and alcohol use initiation,3,7,8,13 heavier 
alcohol use among boys reporting sexual assault,13 and drinking as a coping behavior.3 
However, prior studies have been limited in several ways. First, prior studies have focused 
exclusively on childhood maltreatment and family dysfunction without examining other 
forms of trauma exposure,3,7,8,13 even though potentially traumatic events experienced 
outside the home are strong predictors of mental health and substance use outcomes in adult 
populations.14-19 Second, these studies have largely relied on the retrospective reports of 
adults about maltreatment and substance use in childhood and adolescence,3,7,8 which 
decrease in accuracy with increasing age.20-22 Third, most studies have assessed clinical or 
convenience samples,7,8,13 limiting the potential to provide population estimates for the 
efficacy of any interventions or policy changes, and precluding conclusions of whether these 
associations would persist among more diverse samples. Fourth, no prior studies that we are 
aware of have examined effects across specific types of illicit drugs that could help in

 understanding the etiology of drug use problems and in targeting interventions to prevent 
adolescent drug use.23,24 Fifth, no studies have examined whether associations between 
PTEs and adolescent drug use are equivalent for individuals with or without comorbid 
psychiatric disorders, even though there is robust evidence of multifinality following 
exposure to PTEs,25-27 particularly for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance 
use.28-30 Finally, prior studies have not controlled for the potential confounding or 
moderating effects of parental substance misuse in estimates of substance use outcomes,9,13 
or have treated parental substance misuse as a direct form of adversity.3,7,10 Parental 
substance misuse could confound the association between childhood PTEs and adolescent 
drug use because of its association with exposure to a dysfunctional home environment, 
family violence, and other forms of trauma,31,32 as well as its influence on adolescent drug 
use through biological predisposition, access to drugs in the home, modeling behavior, low 
parental involvement, and social acceptability.3,6,33-38 Furthermore, parental substance 
misuse could also moderate the association between PTEs and drug use, because adolescents 
with a parent who misuses substances could be at higher risk for drug use due to 
predisposition, access, and modeling.
In summary, this is the first study to our knowledge to examine associations between a broad 
range of traumatic events in childhood with specific types of drug use in a nationally 
representative sample of adolescents, adjusting for parental substance misuse. We examine 
PTEs experienced during childhood and their associations with drug use in adolescence, 
independent of any proximal traumatic stressors occurring simultaneously with drug use. We 
focus on trauma exposure prior to age 11, as this is the age when most US adolescents 
transition from elementary to middle school, with the related exposure to older students, 
more independence, and potentially greater opportunities for using illicit drugs.5,6,39-41 In 
secondary analyses, we also assessed if any associations persist among adolescents reporting 
parental substance misuse, or diagnosed with distress or behavior disorders. Data were 
drawn from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication–Adolescent Supplement (NCS-
A). The primary aim of this study was to examine the association between multiple types of 
PTEs in childhood with use of various illicit drugs in adolescence. In addition, we also 
determined the role of parental substance misuse in these associations.
 METHOD
 Study Design and Sample
The National Comorbidity Survey–Adolescent Supplement (NCS-A) was conducted 
between 2001 and 2004. Adolescents were selected from households participating in the 
National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R) at a response rate of 86.8% (879 
adolescents). An additional sample was derived from schools at a response rate of 82.6% 
(9,244 adolescents). The total NCS-A sample was 10,123 English-speaking adolescents, 
ages 13-18 years old. Data were weighted for variability in probability of selection and 
differential non-response based on population sociodemographic distributions. Merged 
weighted household and school samples were adjusted for design effects, and closely 
approximate the sociodemographic distribution of the 2000 US census population.42-44

 elsewhere.43-45 For the current study, we excluded any participant who was missing a 
response for any of the PTEs or survey stratification variables, creating a final analytic 
sample of 9,956 adolescents (98.4%). Written informed consent from parents and assent 
from adolescents were obtained from all participants. Study procedures were approved by 
Human Subjects Committees at Harvard Medical School and the University of Michigan. 
The current study was approved by the Human Subjects Committee at Columbia University.
 Measures
 Exposure: Potentially Traumatic Events—Potentially traumatic events assessed in 
this study included items from the Criterion A1 assessment for PTSD included in the 
Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) portion of the NCS-A.46 The CIDI for 
DSM-IV is a fully-structured diagnostic instrument administered by trained lay 
interviewers.47 Following prior work in this sample and others showing differential 
consequences of certain traumatic event types,10,44,48,49 Criterion A1 PTEs were grouped 
into the following categories: interpersonal violence (physical abuse by caregiver, physical 
assault by someone else, mugged, raped, sexually assaulted, stalked, kidnapped, or domestic 
violence exposure), traumatic accidents (car accident, other serious accident, natural or man-
made disaster, physical illness, toxic chemical exposure, or accidentally injured someone), 
network or witnessing events (unexpected death of a loved one, traumatic experience of a 
loved one, or witnessing injury or death), and other events. This final category included a 
question from the PTSD instrument asking, “Did you ever experience any other extremely 
upsetting or life-threatening event that I haven’t asked about yet?” and a question about 
events that the participant did not feel comfortable disclosing to the interviewer. While we 
lack details of the event type for this measure, prior studies have shown this “other” category 
to be particularly highly associated with psychiatric disorders.44 We created a variable to 
assess exposure to any PTE, and a count variable assessing exposure to no PTEs, to only one 
PTE type, two PTE types, and three or more PTE types (due to low frequencies above this 
number), based on the original 19 items from the PTSD checklist.
 Outcome: Lifetime Illicit Drug Use—Adolescents were asked whether they had ever 
used a list of illicit drugs “even once.” Respondents were asked about (1) “marijuana or 
hashish”; (2) “cocaine in any form, including powder, crack, free base, coca leaves, or 
paste”; (3) “tranquilizers, stimulants, painkillers, or other prescription drugs either without 
the recommendation of a health professional, or for any reason other than a health 
professional said you should use them”; and (4) “heroin, opium, glue, LSD, peyote, or any 
other drug.”45,50 We created a dichotomous variable for polydrug use by combining 
affirmative responses from the above list, and assigning a “yes” value if participants 
endorsed use of greater than one drug type.
In order to establish temporality between our exposures and outcomes, to focus on trauma 
experienced during childhood as a distinct developmental stage, and to capture the initiation 
of drug use among the vast majority of our sample, we only assessed PTEs with the first 
occurrence before age 11 (74% of events), and excluded drug use with first occurrence 
before age 11 (<1% of the sample).

  Moderation and Control Variables—Baseline demographic control variables 
included sex, age (continuous), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, 
Hispanic, other), and parent income (low income, low-middle income, high-middle income, 
high income). Final regression models also controlled for possible confounding by parent 
substance misuse (combined binary measure of adolescents’ reports of problem drinking or 
drug use for mothers or fathers). Interaction terms were constructed to assess moderation of 
the association between PTEs and drug use by parent substance misuse, as well as by 
lifetime distress disorder (DSM-IV diagnosis of social anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress 
disorder, dysthymia, major depression, or generalized anxiety disorder) and lifetime 
behavior disorder (DSM-IV diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, 
oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, anorexia nervosa, bulimia, or binge eating 
disorder), using classifications based on prior factor analyses in this sample.51.
 Statistical Analysis
After assessing univariate and bivariate statistics for the full sample, we estimated logistic 
regression models for the association between PTEs and lifetime prevalence of drug use 
among adolescents. First, we estimated the association between any PTE and the five drugs 
of interest, controlling for baseline demographic variables. We then controlled for parent 
substance misuse in these models. We repeated these steps using a categorical variable for 
number of PTEs reported (0, 1, 2, 3 or more) and for specific categories of PTEs. Finally, we 
assessed statistical interaction between PTEs and parental substance misuse, adolescent 
distress disorder, and adolescent behavior disorder. For any significant interaction, 
regression models were stratified by the moderator of interest. Sensitivity analyses assessed 
whether effect estimates changed when controlling for all PTE types in the same model 
simultaneously.
Due to the high prevalence of some outcomes, odds ratios obtained from logistic regression 
models were converted to model-adjusted risk ratios using predicted marginals.52,53 Results 
are presented as adjusted risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI)s. All analyses 
were conducted to account for the complex survey design of the NCS-A and included 
sample weights to account for differential probability of selection and to be nationally 
representative based on sociodemographic characteristics. Analyses were conducted using 
SAS-callable SUDAAN version 11.0 (Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, 
NC, 2012).
 RESULTS
Prevalences of sociodemographic variables in this sample have been reported previously, and 
are representative of the 2000 US census population.54 Before age 11, 36% of participants 
had experienced at least one PTE, 23% reported only one type of PTE, 8% reported two, and 
4% reported three or more (Table 1). Before the age of 11, 11% of participants had 
experienced interpersonal violence, 18% a traumatic accident, 15% had witnessed or heard 
about a traumatic event happening to a loved one, and 4% reported an unspecified event. For 
lifetime drug use, 22% had ever used marijuana, 2% cocaine, 5% prescription drugs not for 
medical reasons, 3% other drugs, and 6% multiple drugs.

  Specific Event Types and Drug Use
Exposure to interpersonal violence before the age of 11 was associated with higher risk for 
lifetime use of all drug types, controlling for demographic covariates (Table 2). These effects 
were attenuated after controlling for parent substance misuse, but associations remained 
statistically significant. Interpersonal violence was associated with use of marijuana 
(RR=1.78, CI: 1.54-2.07), cocaine (RR=2.64, CI:1.75-3.98), nonmedical prescription drugs 
(RR=2.20, CI: 1.49-3.27), other drugs (RR=1.70, CI: 1.12-2.57), and multiple drugs 
(RR=2.31, CI:1.69-3.15).
In baseline models, exposure to traumatic accidents was associated with higher risk for 
lifetime marijuana, cocaine, and other drug use. After controlling for parent substance 
misuse, effect sizes were attenuated, and only cocaine use remained statistically significant. 
Witnessing a traumatic event or hearing about the PTEs of loved ones was associated with 
higher risk for marijuana and other drug use in baseline models. However, none of these 
associations remained significant after controlling for parent substance misuse. Unspecified 
PTEs were associated with higher risk for all types of drug use save cocaine in baseline 
models. After controlling for parent substance misuse, other PTEs were associated with 
higher risk for marijuana use (RR=1.48, CI: 1.14-1.93) and cocaine use (RR=1.84, CI: 
1.21-2.80).
Sensitivity analyses assessed whether these associations persisted when simultaneously 
estimating all four PTE classes in the same regression models. We found that effect sizes 
were slightly attenuated in all models, but no tests of statistical significance of PTE exposure 
classes were changed in any instance (results not shown). Therefore, independent of 
exposure to other types of PTEs, all reported associations remained statistically significant 
for unique PTE exposures.
 Number of Traumatic Events and Drug Use
Controlling for demographic covariates, exposure to any PTE before the age of 11 was 
associated with higher risk for lifetime use of marijuana (RR=1.50, CI: 1.33-1.69), cocaine 
(RR=2.78, CI: 1.95-3.97), nonmedical prescription drugs (RR=1.80, CI: 1.29-2.51), other 
drugs (RR=1.90, CI: 1.37-2.63), and multiple drugs (RR=1.74, CI: 1.37-2.20) (Table 2). 
Controlling for parent substance misuse attenuated these effect estimates; however, all 
remained statistically significant. There was evidence of a positive monotonic relationship 
for number of PTEs experienced and risk of marijuana, other drug, and polydrug use (Figure 
1). Controlling for demographic covariates and parent substance misuse, any, one, two, and 
three or more childhood PTEs reported were all statistically associated with higher risk for 
marijuana and cocaine use.
 Moderation by Parent Substance Misuse and Adolescent Psychiatric Disorders
Our results indicated that parental substance misuse largely failed to moderate the 
association between PTEs and adolescent drug use. Significant interactions were only 
observed for two drug use types. Adolescents reporting parent substance misuse were at 
higher risk for lifetime marijuana use associated with other PTEs (RR=1.63, CI: 1.28-2.07), 
compared to adolescents reporting no parent substance misuse (RR=1.38, CI: 1.00-1.90; 
Carliner et al.

 pinteraction=.046). Adolescents reporting parent substance misuse were also at higher risk for 
use of other drugs associated with interpersonal PTEs (pinteraction=.02), any PTE 
(pinteraction=.02), and number of PTEs (pinteraction=.001), compared to adolescents not 
reporting parent substance misuse.
Similarly, adolescent distress disorders and behavioral disorders mostly did not moderate the 
associations between PTEs and drug use. The single exception was for interpersonal 
violence PTEs and nonmedical prescription drug use, where adolescents without a history of 
behavior disorder were at higher risk for prescription drug use (RR=3.00, CI: 1.92-4.70) 
compared to adolescents with a history of behavior disorder (RR=1.45, CI: 0.95-2.22; 
pinteraction=.0008).
 DISCUSSION
In this population-representative sample of US adolescents, exposure to any PTE in 
childhood was associated with higher risk for lifetime use of all illicit drugs assessed. We 
found evidence for a dose-response relationship between number of PTEs experienced and 
marijuana, other drug, and polydrug use. Interpersonal violence experienced in childhood 
was consistently associated with lifetime use of all illicit drugs assessed, even after 
controlling for the confounding effect of parent substance misuse, which attenuated the 
effect sizes of many of the associations assessed. To our knowledge, this is the first 
population-based study to report that traumatic events other than childhood maltreatment are 
associated with higher risk for marijuana, cocaine, and nonmedical prescription drug use 
among adolescents.
Consistent with prior research using both the NCS-A and the adult sample of the National 
Comorbidity Survey (NCS-R), childhood maltreatment and interpersonal violence are 
strongly associated with multiple psychiatric and behavioral outcomes.10,11,44,46 Combined 
with results from previous studies on diverse health outcomes, our findings here confirm that 
these forms of physical and sexual violence exhibit multifinality in that they are associated 
with elevated risk for multiple adverse outcomes, including health behaviors, not only 
diagnosed disorders.44,46,48 Health behaviors such as adolescent drug use may be modifiable 
risk factors that can be targeted to prevent future adverse health outcomes.55 Efforts to 
prevent the particularly devastating forms of trauma such as physical, sexual, and domestic 
violence should be at the forefront. Researchers should continue to explore risk factors for 
the perpetration of this violence in order to inform policy and social welfare initiatives with 
an evidence-based primary prevention approach.
Although our measure of interpersonal violence comprised many of the indicators that are 
usually included in studies of childhood maltreatment (i.e., physical and sexual assault, 
domestic violence), our results also indicate that other forms of trauma are also associated 
with illicit drug use in adolescents when interpersonal violence exposure was controlled for 
in statistical models. Adolescents who experienced accidental PTEs were at elevated risk 
specifically for cocaine use. Prior work has shown that the association between unintentional 
or accidental events and adverse outcomes are generally less robust.56,57 However, 
particularly in an adolescent sample, perhaps these accidents and illnesses pose more real

 threat of death than other events, thus making the “dose” of traumatic stress stronger in this 
category.56-60 Future research should try to replicate these findings to determine whether this 
specificity of association persists in other populations, and if so, by what mechanism it may 
act. Specifically, researchers and clinicians should explore the nature of these events and 
their consequences, and try to determine whether the specific association with cocaine use 
has any relationship to the type of medical treatment received following these accidents or 
illnesses.
Events not disclosed to the survey team by participants were associated with higher risk for 
marijuana and non-medical prescription drug use, in line with past work showing that other/
private events are associated with onset of psychiatric disorders and persistence of PTSD.44 
This should be noted by researchers conducting future life events surveys, if study 
participants are less likely to report certain types of traumatic events. Healthcare workers 
and caregivers should also be aware of increased risk for drug use arising from undisclosed 
traumatic events.
The strongest effect sizes were for interpersonal violence and risk of cocaine and 
nonmedical prescription drug use, and for traumatic accidents and cocaine use. Future 
studies should explore whether these associations are driven by socio-environmental factors 
related to access to different drug types or whether there is something about the 
psychoactive effects of cocaine and some prescription drugs that is specifically sought by 
adolescents coping with traumatic memories.
The substantial confounding by parent substance misuse that we observed also deserves 
more attention in future studies. The associations between interpersonal violence and drug 
use outcomes were confounded by parent substance misuse, indicating a domestic 
environment with multiple forms of inter-related traumas for some children. Future studies 
should examine the mechanisms by which parental substance use and exposure to traumatic 
events are associated with adolescent substance use, for example through an influence on 
social norms and expectancies, modeling behavior, access to illicit substances, or by 
providing opportunity via low parental involvement or neglect.3,6,33-38 These explorations 
were beyond the scope of the current study, but future research can inform priorities for 
intervention in harmful home environments for children and adolescents. By and large, 
parent substance misuse did not affect the associations between PTEs and drug use. 
Exceptions included other PTEs and marijuana use, and interpersonal PTEs and other drug 
use. This could be related to access to drugs in the home or neighborhood, as marijuana and 
certain types of other drugs may be more easily obtained by adolescents. Alternatively, this 
statistical interaction could represent a constellation of adversity related to family 
dysfunction, as discussed in prior studies.10,46 Future work should utilize latent variable 
techniques to further explore these complex associations and pathways.
Given the breadth of exposures and outcomes assessed in the current study, it was beyond 
the scope of this article to assess the multiple possible mechanisms by which PTEs are 
associated with adolescent substance use. Future studies, ideally using longitudinal data, 
should continue to explore these patterns by conducting formal tests of mediation, assessing 
indirect effects of PTEs through distress and behavior disorders on substance use among

 both boys and girls. Additional avenues for future work include examination of the ways in 
which social norms, peer groups, sociodemographic factors, and drug availability affect 
these associations, and whether any protective factors exist that could be used to design 
interventions and educational campaigns for adolescents.
A number of limitations should be considered in interpreting these results. First, all 
associations reported here should be interpreted with caution, due to the cross-sectional 
nature of the data. However, our results are consistent with numerous prior studies3,7,8,10 
reporting associations between childhood trauma and drug use outcomes. Furthermore, the 
potential for reverse causation is minimized because we only included PTEs experienced 
before the age of 11 and drug use after the age of 10.
A second concern is the retrospective reporting of both PTEs and lifetime drug use. While 
the potential for recall bias is reduced in younger participants with shorter lags between 
timing of event and reporting of event,20-22 we still cannot rule out the possibility of under-
reporting of drug use due to social desirability bias and under-reporting of PTEs due to 
forgetting or trauma-related non-acceptance. These biases could result in either over-
estimation or underestimation of results reported here. However, the prevalence of drug use 
reported in the NCS-A is consistent with or higher than that reported in other surveys,50,61,62 
and the prevalence of any exposure to PTEs is only slightly lower than that of adult 
samples,44,63 suggesting that under-reporting may not be of great concern in this study.
Third, as noted above, confounding of the association between PTEs and drug use could be 
due to parental substance misuse, which we adjust for in final models. However, parental 
substance misuse could also be a direct outcome of a PTE, if the event was experienced by 
both the parent and the child (e.g. death of a loved one, car accidents). Including this 
variable in statistical models may therefore induce bias in these estimates. As we are unable 
to tease out the temporality of these variables in the NCS-A dataset, we present models both 
unadjusted and adjusted for parental substance misuse, for comparison. We also conducted 
interaction tests to assess moderation by parental substance misuse, and mostly found no 
significant differences, as noted above. Future studies should utilize longitudinal data to 
further explore these associations.
Fourth, another limitation is common to all studies using the PTSD Criterion A1 list of 
PTEs. This list of event types does not adequately capture the “dose” of the traumatic 
experience, the severity of the event, or the context in which the event was experienced.64 
This makes it difficult to determine whether familial and sexual violence experiences are 
more strongly associated with deleterious outcomes because they are chronic experiences of 
trauma occurring within a child’s home, or because the events themselves are more 
“toxic”.59 Complementary research should continue to assess these more qualitative aspects 
of traumatic stress.
This study adds to the large body of research documenting the potentially toxic effects of 
psychological trauma to a wide range of behavioral and health outcomes beyond PTSD. 
These findings add to the childhood adversity literature by demonstrating: (1) that PTEs 
experienced in childhood are associated with drug use in adolescence – a potentially

 modifiable health behavior – and therefore a target for intervention and treatment in youth 
and (2) that adolescents with a trauma history are a high-risk group for illicit drug use and 
may benefit from prevention efforts that specifically address traumatic memories and coping 
strategies for dealing with stressful life events. Future work should explore whether 
adolescents with a trauma history are more likely to develop chronic or harmful drug use 
than their non-traumatized peers. In combination with other signs and indicators, early drug 
use can act as a marker for adolescents who may need additional support or intervention. For 
clinicians, our results combined with other studies imply that drug treatment programs may 
need to more directly address childhood trauma in their therapeutic approach. Early 
interventions targeting coping with trauma during this critical period of adolescence could 
have broad benefits to health and wellbeing of adults.
