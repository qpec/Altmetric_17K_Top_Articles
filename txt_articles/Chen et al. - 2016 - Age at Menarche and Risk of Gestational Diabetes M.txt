 Age at Menarche and Risk of
Gestational Diabetes Mellitus:
A Prospective Cohort Study
Among 27,482 Women
Diabetes Care 2016;39:469–471 | DOI: 10.2337/dc15-2011
OBJECTIVE
To examine the association between age at menarche and risk of gestational
diabetes mellitus (GDM).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
A prospective cohort study of 42,109 eligible pregnancies from 27,482 women in
the Nurses’ Health Study II.
RESULTS
The adjusted risk ratios for GDM across the age at menarche categories (£11, 12,
13, and ‡14 years) were 1.34 (95% CI 1.14–1.58), 1.13 (0.97–1.31), 1.11 (0.95–
1.29), and 1.00 (referent; P for trend = 0.0005), respectively. Analysis of the
mediating effect indicated that 42.1% (P = 0.0007) of the association was mediated
through prepregnancy BMI.
CONCLUSIONS
These findings suggested that earlier menarche was significantly associated with
an increased risk of GDM. This association was largely mediated through prepreg-
nancy excessive body adiposity.
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common pregnancy com-
plications, affecting ;2–7% of all pregnancies in the U.S. (1). Identifying women
who are at high risk of GDM has important public health and clinical significances.
Menarche is an indicator of pubertal onset and the beginning of reproductive life in
women. Although early menarche has been associated with risk factors for GDM,
such as insulin resistance (2,3) and obesity (4–6), the association between age at
menarche and risk of GDM has yet to be investigated. The objective of this study was
to examine the association between menarche timing and GDM risk, and the extent
to which the association is mediated through prepregnancy obesity.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
The Nurses’ Health Study II, initiated in 1989, is an ongoing prospective cohort of U.S.
female nurses. For the current study, the final sample included 27,482 women (42,109
eligible pregnancies) who did not have diabetes and other major chronic diseases at
baseline or prior to GDM, and were observed until 2001 (after which most women had
passed the reproductive age).

NOVEL COMMUNICATIONS IN DIABETES
 GDM events were identified based on
self-reported information and updated
every 2 years. A previous validation
study (7) demonstrated a high validity
of self-reported diagnosis of GDM in
this cohort (94% of women who reported
to have GDM were confirmed by a phy-
sician review based on medical record
review). Age at menarche was defined
as the age of the first menstruation
and was collected in 1989 (baseline
questionnaire).
Age at menarche was grouped into a
categorical variable (#11, 12, 13, and
$14 years of age) to ensure adequate
sample size in each age category. Log-
binomial models were performed to esti-
mate the risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI of
GDM associated with age at menarche,
with generalized estimating equations
assuming a similar within-person correla-
tion across two or more pregnancies for a
single woman. Multivariate regression
models were applied to control for poten-
tial confounding factors. The mediating
effect was evaluated by calculating the
mediation proportion that represents
the proportion for excess risk of GDM
that can be attributed to a mediator.
RESULTS
Wedocumented1,404pregnanciescompli-
cated by GDM (346 were recurrent GDM)
among 27,482 women (92% were Cauca-
sian). The mean age at menarche was
12.6 6 1.5 years, and the median was
12.0 years. In general, women with an ear-
lier age at menarche had a lower birth
weight, a larger body size at age 5 and
10 years, a greater BMI at age 18 years,
andagreaterweightgainsinceage18years
(Supplementary Table 1). Moreover, they
were more likely to be overweight or obese
before pregnancy, to have a higher BMI at
18 years of age and before the index
pregnancy, and to gain more weight since
18 years of age than women with older
ages at menarche. Early menarche was sig-
nificantly associated with an increased risk
of GDM (Table 1). After adjusting for age,
race/ethnicity, and family history of diabe-
tes, pregnancies among women with men-
arche at #11 years of age had a 39%
increased risk of GDM (RR 1.39, 95% CI
1.19–1.63) compared with pregnancies
among women with menarche at 14 years
of age (referent) (multivariate model 1).
The association did not change, and the
trend remained significant with addi-
tional adjustment for women’s birth
weight, and somatotype at ages 5 and
10 years (P for trend = 0.0003; multivar-
iate model 2), suggesting that the asso-
ciation between age at menarche and
GDM is not confounded by intrauterine
and childhood adiposity before the on-
set of menarche. After further adjust-
ment for adulthood lifestyle factors (i.e.,
alcohol consumption, smoking status,
Alternate Healthy Eating Index 2010,
total physical activity, marital status,
and oral contraceptive use in model 3),
the RRs across the menarche categories
(#11, 12, 13, and $14 years of age) were
1.34 (95% CI 1.14–1.58), 1.13 (0.97–1.31),
1.11 (0.95–1.29), and 1.00 (referent; P for
trend = 0.0005; multivariate model 3),
respectively, indicating that the associa-
tion is independent of adulthood lifestyle
factors.
To further understand how body
weight/adiposity after the onset of
menarche impacts the menarche-GDM
association, we tested the results by
adding adolescent and adulthood BMI
in the multivariate models. Additional
adjustment for BMI at 18 years of age
did not materially change the results.
The association, however, was substan-
tially attenuated and became statistically
insignificant after further adjustment of
prepregnancy BMI (data not shown).
We further calculated the proportions of
effects mediated through prepregnancy
BMI. The estimated proportion for excess
risk ofGDMwas 42.1% (95% CI17.9–66.3,
P = 0.0007) for prepregnancy BMI, indi-
cating that prepregnancy BMI was a me-
diator for the associations between age at
menarche and GDM risk.
CONCLUSIONS
Two major findings were observed from
this prospective study of 42,109 preg-
nancies among 27,482 women. First,
earlier menarche was significantly asso-
ciated with an increased risk of GDM,
independent of established risk factors,
such as age, parity, family history of di-
abetes, smoking, oral contraceptive use,
physical activity, birth weight, and child-
hood adiposity. Second, the association
between age at menarche and GDM risk
might be partly mediated through pre-
pregnancy obesity.
We were aware of one previous study
that examined the relationship between
age at menarche and GDM among 3,419
women (185 GDM events), and reported
no association. Our findings provide
new evidence that earlier menarche is
associated with GDM and are generally
in agreement with several recent large
cohort studies (8–13) in which earlier
menarche was significantly associated
with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes
in middle- to old-aged adults. The pre-
cise mechanism by which early age at
menarche may increase the risk of
GDM is not clear. Early menarche has
been associated with risk factors for
GDM such as excessive prepregnancy
obesity (4–6) and insulin resistance
(2,3). In the current study, the observed
association was substantially attenuated

Age at Menarche and GDM in NHS II
Diabetes Care Volume 39, March 2016
 after adjusting for prepregnancy BMI. The
estimated proportion of risk of GDM that
was mediated by prepregnancy BMI was
42.1%, suggesting that prepregnancy ad-
iposity may play an important role in
mediating this association. Other path-
ways might also be implicated in the as-
sociation between age at menarche and
GDM. Earlier age at menarche was associ-
ated with adulthood higher estrogen lev-
els and lower serum sex hormone–binding
globulin levels among women (14). High
plasma estradiol and testosterone and/or
low sex hormone–binding globulin lev-
els were also associated with a higher
risk of GDM (15), independent of adiposity.
Therefore, it is plausible that age at men-
arche may be related to GDM risk through
its association with hormonal changes. Fu-
ture studies to investigate the underlying
mechanisms are warranted.
In summary, earlier age at menarche
was associated with an elevated risk
of GDM. A large proportion, but not all,
of this association was mediated through
excessive adiposity before pregnancy.
Early age at menarche might represent
another risk factor for the early identifi-
cation of girls who are at increased risk of
the development of GDM in adulthood.
