The 11-year long-term follow-up study
from the randomized BENEFIT CIS trial
ABSTRACT
Objective: To assess outcomes for patients treated with interferon beta-1b immediately after clin-
ically isolated syndrome (CIS) or after a short delay.
Methods: Participants in BENEFIT (Betaferon/Betaseron in Newly Emerging MS for Initial Treat-
ment) were randomly assigned to receive interferon beta-1b (early treatment) or placebo (delayed
treatment). After conversion to clinically definite multiple sclerosis (CDMS) or 2 years, patients on
placebo could switch to interferon beta-1b or another treatment. Eleven years after randomiza-
tion, patients were reassessed.
Results: Two hundred seventy-eight (59.4%) of the original 468 patients (71.3% of those eligible at
participating sites) were enrolled (early: 167 [57.2%]; delayed: 111 [63.1%]). After 11 years, risk of
CDMS remained lower in the early-treatment arm compared with the delayed-treatment arm (p 5
0.0012), with longer time to first relapse (median [Q1, Q3] days: 1,888 [540, not reached] vs 931
[253, 3,296]; p 5 0.0005) and lower overall annualized relapse rate (0.21 vs 0.26; p 5 0.0018). Only
25 patients (5.9%, overall; early, 4.5%; delayed, 8.3%) converted to secondary progressive multiple
sclerosis. Expanded Disability Status Scale scores remained low and stable, with no difference
between treatment arms (median [Q1, Q3]: 2.0 [1.0, 3.0]). The early-treatment group had better Paced
Auditory Serial Addition Task–3 total scores (p 5 0.0070). Employment rates remained high, and
health resource utilization tended to be low in both groups. MRI metrics did not differ between groups.
Conclusions: Although the delay in treatment was relatively short, several clinical outcomes
favored earlier treatment. Along with low rates of disability and disease progression in both
groups, this supports the value of treatment at CIS.
ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01795872.
Classification of evidence: This study provides Class IV evidence that early compared to delayed
treatment prolongs time to CDMS in CIS after 11 years. Neurology® 2016;87:978–987

CNS, often present with an acute or subacute episode of neurologic dysfunction known as a clin-
ically isolated syndrome (CIS).1,2 Eventually, most of these patients (up to 85%) will be
diagnosed with MS once evidence for dissemination of lesions in space and time accumulates.2,3

 Several controlled studies have shown that
conversion to MS can be delayed by starting
treatment with disease-modifying therapies
(DMTs) at CIS.4–11 However, data about the
effects of starting treatment this early on the
long-term disease course, including potential
improvements relative to delayed treatment on
measures of confirmed disability progression,
participation, and quality of life, are scarce.
The 5-year Betaferon/Betaseron in Newly
Emerging MS for Initial Treatment (BENEFIT)
trial and its 8-year extension have shown
improved outcomes in patients who initiated
treatment with interferon beta-1b (Betaferon/
Betaseron; Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals,
Whippany, NJ) immediately after CIS, relative
to patients who had started treatment after their
second clinical event or 2 years post-CIS at the
latest.6,10 Specifically, we have shown delays in
conversion to CDMS and reductions in the
annualized relapse rate (ARR) 2, 3, 5, and 8
years after randomization6,8–10 but only a small
change in mean Expanded Disability Status
Scale (EDSS) score in both treatment groups
up to the 8-year analysis, indicating a relatively
mild disease course.6 The objective of the pres-
ent study was to examine the longer-term effects
of treatment with interferon beta-1b on the dis-
ease course at 11 years after occurrence of CIS.
METHODS Patient selection. The phase 3 BENEFIT trial
consisted of a prospective, 2-year, international, multicenter,
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study
of interferon beta-1b 250 mg administered subcutaneously every
other day with a preplanned open-label interferon beta-1b treatment
follow-up phase, blinded to the initial treatment allocation and lasting
up to 5 years.10 All patients had experienced a CIS suggestive of MS
and had $2 clinically silent MRI lesions. Enrollment was completed
at centers in Europe, Canada, and Israel between February 2002 and
June 2003.10 The 5-year core and follow-up study was followed by an
open-label observational extension study with a maximum follow-up
of 8.7 years.6 Following the extension study, the investigators decided
to conduct a prospective, comprehensive, 11-year, cross-sectional
reassessment (BENEFIT 11 Study), which is presented here.
Randomization and masking. In the core study, patients were
randomized (5:3) by means of a central interactive voice response sys-
tem within 60 days of CIS to receive either interferon beta-1b
250
mg
(early
treatment)
or
placebo
(delayed
treatment)
subcutaneously every other day. After 2 years or conversion to
CDMS, all patients could have treatment with interferon beta-1b
but could also take another or no DMT.
Assessments. Eleven years after randomization, all patients from
participating study centers who were randomized and treated at
least once in the placebo-controlled phase were eligible to enter
the 11-year follow-up and were approached to participate in
a comprehensive reassessment. The battery of assessments included
(see figure e-1 at Neurology.org for full list): neurologic history
and examination (relapses, current disease course), EDSS,12
Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite,13 employment status and
resource use, health-related quality of life (EuroQoL–5 Dimension
[EQ-5D],14 Functional Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis [FAMS]),15
depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression
Scale),16 fatigue (Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive
Functions),17,18 MS medication history, cognition (Paced

Serial
Addition
Task
[PASAT]-3,

Digit
Modalities Test [SDMT]),19,20 and MRI. Investigators conducted
patient assessments at their respective centers but, to include sicker
patients who were unable to attend a center in person, a structured
interview via phone that included a validated instrument for the
assessment of the EDSS21,22 was offered as an alternative.
CDMS was defined according to slightly modified Poser cri-
teria23 as (1) a relapse with clinical evidence of $1 CNS lesion,
and if the first presentation was monofocal, a lesion distinct from
the one responsible for the CIS presentation, or (2) sustained
progression by $1.5 points on the EDSS reaching a total EDSS
score of $2.5 and confirmed at a consecutive visit 3 months later.
Such EDSS progression must have been based on objective clin-
ical evidence of $1 neurologic abnormality other than vegetative
or cerebral dysfunction.
EDSS progression (unrelated to the CDMS definition) was
defined as an increase of $1 point compared with the initial
EDSS score (the lower of the 2 scores obtained during screening
and baseline) or an increase of $1.5 points if the initial score
was 0. A confirmed EDSS progression was defined as a progres-
sion confirmed at a scheduled study visit $140 days later. A
sustained EDSS progression was defined as a progression that
had been confirmed in the course of BENEFIT or BENEFIT
follow-up and was sustained up to the 11-year visit.
Investigators collected MRI data at study sites according to
a standardized MRI protocol. Scans were analyzed at a central
reading site (VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the
Netherlands). Trained readers manually identified and quantified
lesions using a local thresholding technique.
Statistical procedures. Statistical modeling was used to esti-
mate treatment effects and explore the relationships of target var-
iables to treatment. The study was exploratory in nature, with the
primary objective to describe disease course, particularly time to con-
version to CDMS (Class III evidence) and/or secondary progressive
MS (SPMS), relapse activity, change in disability, cognitive function,
resource use, and working status (Class IV evidence) at year 11. Sec-
ondary objectives included assessment of MRI, treatment history,
quality of life, depression, and DMT choices. Variables of primary
and secondary interest were assessed using proportional hazards
regression for time-to-event outcomes and generalized linear
regression models, with steroid use during first event (yes or no),
multifocal or monofocal onset of disease, and number of T2
lesions at screening (2–4, 5–8, or $9) included as the standard
set of covariates. An extended set of covariates that included
number of gadolinium-enhancing (Gd1) lesions at screening, age,
and sex in addition to the standard covariates was used for analysis of
time to CDMS, time to first relapse, and ARR. Other variables were
analyzed using nonparametric methods. A negative binomial
regression model for T1 lesions adjusting for T2 lesions at
screening and initial treatment as independent variables was fitted.
Changes in imaging hardware and software precluded comparisons
of MRI-related outcomes over time. Therefore, only cross-sectional
MRI comparisons at year 11 between early and delayed treatment
were performed.
Classification of evidence. The primary research question of
the study was to assess the effect of treatment with interferon

 beta-1b at CIS or after a short delay on clinical and MRI
outcomes after 11 years.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. The institutional review boards of participating institu-
tions approved the protocol for the study. Patients provided informed
consent at enrollment into each phase of the trial. The BENEFIT 11
trial is listed on clinicaltrials.gov under NCT01795872.
RESULTS Patient disposition. Of the 468 patients
originally randomized in BENEFIT, 278 (59.4%)
enrolled in BENEFIT 11 (167 [57.2%] from the
early-treatment arm and 111 [63.1%] from the
delayed-treatment arm) between September 2013
and April 2014 in the 66 of 97 sites in 19 countries
that participated in this 11-year follow-up (figure 1).
A total of 71.3% of the patients originally randomized
and treated in these participating sites were enrolled.
Two hundred thirty-seven patients (85.3%) had in-
person assessments at study centers; 41 patients
(14.7%) had phone assessments.
Baseline characteristics and outcomes of the original
cohort vs BENEFIT 11 participants at their last study
visits before the 11-year follow-up were generally well
comparable (table 1) with the exception of a somewhat
higher number converting to CDMS in the 11-year
follow-up group. Patients in the early- and delayed-
treatment arms of the 11-year follow-up also had similar
baseline characteristics. The mean (SD) delay until
starting interferon beta-1b treatment was 1.5 (0.73)
years in the delayed-treatment group. One hundred
seventy-one (61.5%) of the 278 patients enrolled in
BENEFIT 11 were on a DMT at the time of assess-
ment; 86 (30.9%) were on interferon beta-1b. Mean
(SD) time on interferon beta-1b was 1,523.2 (861.4)
days over the 11 years, excluding the BENEFIT Study
medication.
Clinical outcomes. After 11 years, the risk of conver-
sion to CDMS was still reduced by 33.0% for patients
in the early-treatment arm relative to those in the
delayed-treatment arm (hazard ratio 0.670; 95%
confidence interval [CI] 0.526–0.854, p 5 0.0012;
figure 2A). One hundred sixty-two patients (66.6%
of total early-treatment group; Kaplan-Meier [KM]
estimate) in the early-treatment group and 118 (75.0%
of total delayed-treatment group [KM estimate]) in the

 delayed-treatment group had converted to CDMS at any
time until BENEFIT 11. Time to CDMS was shorter in
the delayed-treatment arm (log rank p 5 0.0034) as well
as time to first relapse (hazard ratio 0.655 [95% CI
0.517–0.830], p 5 0.0005). Risk of a first relapse was
reduced by 34.5% in the early-treatment compared with
the delayed-treatment group. The overall ARR over the
11-year study period was lower in the early-treatment
group than in the delayed-treatment group, resulting in
a 19.1% reduction in risk of relapses (risk ratio [RR]
0.8094 [95% CI 0.7090–0.9242], p 5 0.0018; figure
2B). Inspection of figure 2B revealed that the ARR by
study year was not only different during the core study
but also remained lower in all but 2 of the follow-up
years, although after the second year, both groups were
similarly exposed to interferon beta-1b treatment.
Overall, only 25 patients had converted to SPMS
(5.9%, KM estimate) by year 11 (early 4.5%, delayed
8.3%, KM estimate; log rank p 5 0.4857). EDSS
scores also did not differ between the treatment arms.
EDSS scores of study participants remained low and
stable with a median (quartile [Q]1, Q3) score of 2.0
(1.0, 3.0) and median change from baseline over 11
years of 0.5 (20.50, 1.50) in both groups (table 2).
By year 11, 69.8% of patients were fully ambulatory
with minor or no signs of disability (EDSS score
,3.0) (figure 2C).
As a neuropsychological measure, 222 patients had
PASAT-3 data available at baseline and year 11. Over
the entire study period, the PASAT-3 total score
(adjusted for baseline score) was higher in the early-
treatment group (p 5 0.0070) (figure 3). Two hun-
dred thirty-three patients completed the SDMT (early
141, delayed 92). Overall median (Q1, Q3) SDMT
score was 53.0 (44.0, 59.0), with little difference
between groups. No differences were found between
groups on the EQ-5D, FAMS trial outcomes index,
Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions, or
Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale
with stable values relative to baseline for EQ-5D and
FAMS, both of which had also been assessed at base-
line. Absence of fatigue (score ,43) was reported in

 128 patients (46%), and 191 (68.7%) reported no
depressive symptoms.
Both groups had similar resource utilization (table 2).
Overall, 204 patients (73.4% of all patients in the
11-year follow-up) were still employed, compared with
226 patients (81.3%) at study start. Twenty-six patients
(9.4%) were retired at year 11 (22 [7.9%] retired early).
Two hundred seventy-one patients (97.5%) were living
alone or with a spouse/partner/family, with only
3 (1.1%) living in a long-term care facility. Two hun-
dred fifty-four patients (91.4%) had not been hospital-
ized because of MS in the 12 months before the 11-year
assessment. Sixty-seven patients had used second-line
therapy (14.3%, KM estimate: 21.2%) by year 11 (early
38 [13.0%, KM estimate: 19.1%], delayed 29 [16.5%,
KM estimate: 24.4%]).
MRI outcomes. One hundred ninety-one patients had
MRI scans (early 114, delayed 77). All MRI data are
reported as median (Q1, Q3). Relatively little
difference in cerebral lesion number or volume was
seen between the 2 treatment groups. Brain volume
was 1,527.0 cm3 (1,444.0, 1,595.0) in the early-
treatment group and 1,514.0 cm3 (1,429.0, 1,575.5)
in the delayed-treatment group. Ten patients (5.2%)
had 1 Gd1 lesion (early 7 [6.1%], delayed 3 [3.9%])
and 6 patients (3.1%) had 2 to 5 Gd1 lesions (early
5 [4.4%], delayed 1 [1.3%]). The number of new T2
lesions since the patient’s last study scan was 2.0 (0.0,
6.0) in the early-treatment arm and 2.0 (0.0, 6.5) in the
delayed-treatment arm, while T2 lesion volume was
2,237.0 mm3 (618.0, 5,473.0) and 1,640.5 mm3
(911.0, 3,419.0), respectively.
T1 hypointense lesion count was 4.0 (1.0, 11.0) in
the early-treatment group and 2.0 (1.0, 6.0) in the
delayed-treatment group. A regression model identified
an effect of baseline T2 lesion count on the number of
T1 lesions at year 11 (RR 1.02 [95% CI 1.02, 1.03],
p , 0.0001), but treatment did not decrease the number
of lesions (RR 1.29 [95% CI 0.95, 1.76], p 5 0.1030).
Safety. The frequency and type of adverse events re-
ported were consistent with the known profile of
interferon beta-1b. There were no new safety signals
detected at year 11. No serious adverse events were
reported during BENEFIT 11.
DISCUSSION Performing a comprehensive reassess-
ment after 11 years in a well-characterized group of
patients, systematically followed since the initial
clinical manifestation, provides a unique opportunity
to better understand the benefits of early treatment
on outcomes relevant to patients and physicians.
This long-term follow-up study provided Class IV
evidence that time to CDMS was prolonged and that
additional clinical measures (ARR, PASAT score)
were improved by early treatment while both groups
showed a generally mild disease course. If we
consider the length of follow-up, this trial included
a
sizable
proportion
(71%)
of
the
originally
randomized patients from the centers participating in
BENEFIT 11. The comparison of baseline and
available follow-up characteristics of patients who did
not participate with those who participated in
BENEFIT 11 did not reveal sources of systematic
bias by selective dropout. A factor that may be

 critical to interpretation of these data is the unblinding
of the initial randomization that occurred after
completion of the year 5 assessments and the
uncontrolled nature of treatment after the placebo-
controlled phase, a characteristic shared with natural
history and observational treatment studies.
Even if we consider this and differences in method-
ology that make cross-study comparisons difficult, sev-
eral clinically relevant outcomes in the current study
remained relatively stable over 11 years and compare
favorably with those reported in natural history
cohorts. This is reflected in the high proportion of
patients having EDSS score ,3.0 and remaining em-
ployed through year 11 and in the low rate of conver-
sion to SPMS. A natural history study from Canada
found that after 10.2 years, 50% of the patients had
reached EDSS score $3.0.24 A group of 1,261 patients
from 5 European countries with similar disease dura-
tion and demographics had rates of employment rang-
ing from 51% to 63%, with the exception of patients
from Italy where 78% remained employed (but in
a population that on average was 3 years younger
and had a 3-year shorter duration of disease than the
BENEFIT 11 population).25 A cohort of 241 patients
with MS from Canada also had lower rates of employ-
ment (54%).24 Natural history studies have reported
median times to progressive disease ranging from 1526
to 19 years27,28 since the original attack.29,30
The more favorable outcomes as compared to nat-
ural course studies may be overestimated because of
differences in ascertainment26,30 and temporal shifts
with more recent studies showing better outcomes ir-
respective of treatment allocation.31 Nevertheless, after
11 years, we observed a relative stability with no appar-
ent difference between the randomization arms. A pos-
sible explanation of this relative stability may be found
in the fact that both arms can be considered to have
received treatment relatively early in the course of the
disease as even the delayed-treatment group started
treatment within a maximum of 2 years following CIS.
Despite the relatively short delay in treatment initi-
ation in the placebo group, measures reflecting clinical
disease activity such as time to CDMS, time to first
relapse, and relapse rates, as well as scores on the PA-
SAT, the only neuropsychological test applied from
baseline to year 11, still suggest persistent long-term
benefits of the earlier treatment. Although the overall
lower ARR favoring the earlier-treatment group ap-
pears to be mainly driven by differences in the first year
of the core study, it is intriguing to see that in the early-
treatment group, ARR remained lower in all but 2 of
the follow-up years—when treatment with interferon
beta-1b was equally available to both groups. This
finding suggests the possibility of a more remote
decrease in the pathogenic factors that contribute to
detectable attacks. This could be an effect on immune
regulation or the consequence of better preserved com-
pensation capacity that allowed the consequences of
inflammatory attacks to be reduced.
This study adds to the literature on the optimal
treatment of patients with MS by supporting and ex-
panding the data on treatment at the earliest clinical
manifestation of the disease. Other studies have shown
benefits of early treatment for patients with CIS10,32,33;
however, BENEFIT 11 includes longer follow-up with
additional outcome measures that have not previously
been described, including resource use, employment
status, and patient-reported outcomes. Despite the
inherent problems of a comparison with natural course
studies, our results indicate that early treatment with
interferon beta-1b had a long-lasting, even remote, ben-
eficial effect on disease activity as well as cognitive out-
comes, resource utilization, and employment rate.
Taken together, the findings of BENEFIT 11 reinforce
the importance of starting therapy with interferon beta-
1b as soon as possible after the onset of MS symptoms.
