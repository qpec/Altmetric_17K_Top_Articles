AbsTrACT
Objective to examine whether social isolation and 
loneliness (1) predict acute myocardial infarction (aMi) 
and stroke among those with no history of aMi or stroke, 
(2) are related to mortality risk among those with a 
history of aMi or stroke, and (3) the extent to which 
these associations are explained by known risk factors or 
pre-existing chronic conditions.
Methods Participants were 479 054 individuals from 
the UK Biobank. the exposures were self-reported social 
isolation and loneliness. aMi, stroke and mortality were 
the outcomes.
results Over 7.1 years, 5731 had first aMi, and 3471 
had first stroke. in model adjusted for demographics, 
social isolation was associated with higher risk of aMi 
(hr 1.43, 95% ci 1.3 to –1.55) and stroke (hr 1.39, 
95% ci 1.25 to 1.54). When adjusted for all the other 
risk factors, the hr for aMi was attenuated by 84% to 
1.07 (95% ci 0.99 to 1.16) and the hr for stroke was 
attenuated by 83% to 1.06 (95% ci 0.96 to 1.19). 
loneliness was associated with higher risk of aMi 
before (hr 1.49, 95% ci 1.36 to 1.64) but attenuated 
considerably with adjustments (hr 1.06, 95% ci 0.96 to 
1.17). this was also the case for stroke (hr 1.36, 95% ci 
1.20 to 1.55 before and hr 1.04, 95% ci 0.91 to 1.19 
after adjustments). social isolation, but not loneliness, 
was associated with increased mortality in participants 
with a history of aMi (hr 1.25, 95% ci 1.03 to 1.51) 
or stroke (hr 1.32, 95% ci 1.08 to 1.61) in the fully 
adjusted model.
Conclusions isolated and lonely persons are at 
increased risk of aMi and stroke, and, among those with 
a history of aMi or stroke, increased risk of death. Most 
of this risk was explained by conventional risk factors. 
InTrOduCTIOn
Individuals who are socially isolated (ie, are lacking 
social contacts and participation in social activi-
ties) or feel lonely (ie, feel that they have too few 
social contacts or are not satisfied with the quality 
of their social contacts) have been found to be at 
increased risk of incident coronary heart disease 
(CHD),1 stroke2 and early mortality.3–7 A recent 
meta-analysis—including 11 longitudinal studies on 
cardiovascular disease and 8 on stroke—suggested 
that social isolation and loneliness are associ-
ated with 30% excess risk of incident CHD and 
stroke.8 However, most of the studies were small 
in scale, with only one study reporting more than 
1000 events,1 and meta-analytic evidence suggests 
selective publishing of positive findings.8 Further-
more, only a limited set of potential explanatory 
factors have been examined in previous studies and 
mortality after incident CHD or stroke remains 
unexplored. Thus, it remains unclear whether 
these associations are independent of biological, 
behavioural, psychological, health and socioeco-
nomic factors9–11 that are known to increase risk of 
cardiovascular diseases.12 13 In addition, although 
other risk factors, such as physical inactivity14 and 
depression,15 have been associated with poorer 
outcomes among individuals with pre-existing 
cardiovascular disease, it remains unclear whether 
socially isolated or lonely individuals have an 
elevated risk of early mortality after cardiovascular 
disease event.
In this analysis using the UK Biobank study, a 
very large prospective population-based cohort 
study, we examined the associations of social 
isolation and loneliness with first acute myocar-
dial infarction (AMI) and first stroke. In addition, 
we examined whether social isolation and lone-
liness before AMI or stroke event are associated 
with mortality risk after the event. A broad range 
of biological, behavioural, psychological, socio-
economic and mental health-related factors were 
included as potential mediators or confounders of 
these associations.
MeThOds
study design
In total, 502 632 participants (aged 40–69 years) 
were recruited to the UK Biobank study between 
April 2007 and December 2010 from the general 
population (5.5% response rate). Participants 
completed touch-screen questionnaire, had phys-
ical measurements taken and biological samples 
collected by trained data nurses in one of the 22 
assessment centres across England, Wales and 
Scotland. Details of these have been reported else-
where.16 17 In the current study, social isolation 
and loneliness were used as exposures and AMI, 
stroke and mortality after AMI or stroke events as 
outcomes. The present study sample was restricted 
to the 479 054 participants who had complete data 
on either social isolation or loneliness, and AMI 
and stroke. A total of 18 704 participants were 
excluded due to history of AMI or stroke before 
the baseline.

Procedures
Date of death was obtained from death certificates held by the 
National Health Service (NHS) Information Centre (England 
and Wales) and the NHS Central Register Scotland (Scot-
land). Hospital admissions were identified via record linkage 
to Hospital Admitted Patient Care Activity (England), General/
Acute 
Inpatient and Day Case dataset (Scotland), and Patient 
Episode Database for Wales. AMI and stroke events were 
recorded from the death register and hospital admission using 
the following International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 
codes: AMI: I21.X, I22.X, I23.X, I24.1 and I25.2; stroke: I60, 
I61, I63 and I64.
Age was calculated based on birth month and year. Ethnicity 
was defined as Caucasian versus other based on self-reported 
ethnicity. Educational attainment was categorised into three 
groups (no secondary education, secondary education and 
university degree), and annual household income was measured 
with a five-point scale (less than £31 
000, £18 
000 to £29 999, 
£30 
000 to £51 999, £52 
000 to £100 000 and greater than 
£100 000). Area-based socioeconomic status was derived from 
postcode of residence using the Townsend Deprivation Index 
score.18
Social isolation and loneliness were assessed with scales that 
were used in a previous UK Biobank study.7 The social isolation 
scale contained three questions ((1) “Including yourself, how 
many people are living together in your household?”; (2) “How 
often do you visit friends or family or have them visit you?”; 
and (3) “Which of the following (leisure/social activities) do you 
engage in once a week or more often? You may select more than 
one”), where certain answers were given one point (1 point for 
no participation in social activities at least weekly; 1 point for 
living alone; 1 point for friends and family visits less than once 
a month), and all other answers 0 point. This resulted in a scale 
ranging from 0 to 3 where person was defined as socially isolated 
if she/he had two or more points. Loneliness was measured with 
two questions: “Do you often feel lonely?” (no=0, yes=1) and 
“How often are you able to confide in someone close to you?” 
(0=almost 
daily to once every few months; 1=never 
or almost 
never). An individual was defined as lonely if she/he answered 
positively to both questions (score 2). Similar questions are used 
in other social isolation and loneliness scales (eg, Revised UCLA 
Loneliness Scale19).
Height and weight were measured at the clinic, and body 
mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight/height (m)2. Grip 
strength was measured using Jamar (model J00105) hydraulic 
hand dynamometer and the mean of the right-hand and left-
hand values was calculated and used in the analyses. Cigarette 
smoking (current smoker (yes/no); ex-smoker (yes/no)), physical 
activity (moderate and vigorous) and alcohol-intake frequency 
(three or four times a week or more vs once or twice a week 
or less) were self-reported. Depressive symptoms were assessed 
with the following four questions from the Patient Health Ques-
tionnaire20: the frequency of (1) depressed mood, (2) disinterest 
or absence of enthusiasm, (3) tenseness or restlessness, and (4) 
tiredness or lethargy in the previous 2 weeks. Current chronic 
diseases (diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer and other long-
standing illness, disability or infirmity) was categorised into yes 
versus no. Further details of these measures can be found in the 
UK Biobank online protocol (http://www. 
ukbiobank. 
ac. 
uk/).
statistical analyses
Descriptive statistics are presented as mean (SD of the mean) or 
number (percentage) for continuous and categorical variables, 
respectively. Associations between social isolation and loneliness 
with incident AMI, stroke and mortality after AMI or stroke 
were examined using Cox proportional hazards models where 
age was used as the timescale,21 and birth month and year as 
time origin. The proportional hazards assumption was graph-
ically investigated using log–log plots and Schoenfeld residual 
plots, and no major violations were observed. AMI, stroke 
and mortality after AMI or stroke were examined as separate 
outcomes. Age, sex and ethnicity were used as covariates in all 
models. Subgroup analyses were conducted separately for men 
and women, three age groups (37–52 years; 53–60 years; 61–73 
years) and ethnic groups (white vs non-white) as these can be 
seen as potential confounders.
To examine the extent to which baseline biological, 
behavioural, socioeconomic, psychological and health-related 
risk factors explained the associations, percentage of excess 
risk mediated (PERM) was calculated for the following mech-
anisms: (1) biological (BMI, diastolic and systolic blood pres-
sure, grip strength); (2) behavioural (alcohol consumption, 
physical activity and smoking); (3) socioeconomic (education, 
household income and Townsend Deprivation Index) and (4) 
mental health (depressive symptoms); and (5) history of chronic 
illness. PERM was calculated using the following formula22: 
  
PERM =
[HR(age, sex and ethnicity adjusted)
−HR(age, sex, and ethnicity and risk factor adjusted)]
/[HR(age, sex and ethnicity adjusted) − 1] × 100  
 
Missing data were imputed with multiple imputation proce-
dure using the chained equations method.23 In total, five imputed 
datasets were generated and results were combined using Rubin’s 
rules. Imputation model included basic demographics (age, sex 
and ethnicity), predictors (social isolation and loneliness), all 
mediating variables, the Nelson-Aalen estimate of cumulative 
hazard, and AMI and stroke status. All statistical analyses were 
conducted using Stata V
.13.1.

resulTs
Descriptive statistics are shown in table 1 (for descriptive statis-
tics according to social isolation and loneliness status, please see 
online supplementary etables 1 and 2; for complete and imputed 
variable frequencies, please see online supplementary etable 
3). Nine per cent of the individuals were socially isolated, 6% 
lonely, and 1% isolated and lonely. From the socially isolated 
individuals, 16% were lonely, and from the individuals who 
were lonely, 23% were socially isolated. Socially isolated and 
lonely individuals had higher prevalence of chronic diseases 
and current smoking. In addition, lonely individuals reported 
more depressive symptoms than non-lonely individuals. The 
mean follow-up was 7.1 years (range 5.4 to 10.0 years). Over 
the follow-up period, a total of 12 
428 participants died, 5731 
had AMI and 3471 had stroke. Of the 5731 participants who 
had AMI, 900 died (16%) during follow-up, and of the 3471 
participants who had incident stroke, 844 died (24%) over the 
follow-up.
The associations of social isolation with incident AMI and 
stroke are shown in figure 1. In analyses adjusted for age, sex 
and ethnicity, social isolation was associated with higher risk

of AMI (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.55, P<0.001). This asso-
ciation was attenuated by 14% after adjustment for biological 
factors, by 50% after adjustment for health behaviours, by 28% 
after adjustment for depressive symptoms, by 48% after adjust-
ment for socioeconomic factors and by 16% after adjustment 
for chronic diseases. In the final model adjusted for all risk 
factors, the association was attenuated by 84% to 1.07 (95% 
CI 0.99 to 1.16) and did not remain statistically significant 
 
(P=0.109).
Social isolation was also associated with higher risk of incident 
stroke (HR 1.39, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.54, P<0.001) in the anal-
yses adjusted for age, sex and ethnicity. The association atten-
uated by 14% after adjustment for biological factors, by 38% 
after adjustment for health behaviours, by 23% after adjustment 
for depressive symptoms, by 55% after adjustment for socioeco-
nomic factors and by 15% after adjustment for chronic diseases. 
When adjusted for all risk factors, the association was attenuated 
by 83% to 1.06 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.19) and was not statistically 
significant (P=0.256).
The associations between loneliness with incident AMI and 
stroke are shown in figure 2. In analyses adjusted for age, sex 
and ethnicity, social isolation was associated with higher risk of 
AMI (HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.36 to 1.64, P<0.001). This associa-
tion decreased by 16% after adjustment for biological factors, 
by 35% after adjustment for health behaviours, by 62% after 
adjustment for depressive symptoms, by 39% after adjustment 
for socioeconomic factors and by 20% after adjustment for 
chronic disease. In the final model adjusted for all risk factors, 
the association did not remain statistically significant (P=0.235) 
and was attenuated by 87% to 1.06 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.17).
Loneliness was associated with higher risk of incident stroke 
(HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.55, P<0.001) in the analyses 
adjusted for sex, age and ethnicity. The association attenuated 
by 16% after adjustment for biological factors, by 29% after 
adjustment for health behaviours, by 60% after adjustment 
for depressive symptoms, by 45% after adjustment for socio-
economic factors and by 21% after adjustment for chronic 
diseases. In the final model, adjusted for all risk factors, the 
association was attenuated by 89% to 1.05 (95% CI 0.92 to 
1.21) and did not remain statistically significant (P=0.577).
When loneliness, social isolation and the interaction 
between social isolation and loneliness were entered in the 
same model, social isolation and loneliness were associated 
with higher risk of AMI (social isolation: HR 1.36, 95% CI 
1.25 to 1.49, P<0.001; loneliness: HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.27 to 
1.59, P<0.001) and incident stroke (social isolation: HR 1.37, 
95% CI 1.22 to 1.54, P<0.001; loneliness: HR 1.35, 95% CI 
1.17 to 1.56, P<0.001) in the analyses additionally adjusted 
for sex, age and ethnicity. The interaction terms between 
social isolation and loneliness were not statistically significant 
(all P >0.05).
Figure 3 shows the associations between social isolation with 
mortality among participants who had incident AMI or stroke. 
Social isolation was associated with higher risk of mortality after 
AMI (HR 1.50, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.79, P<0.001) in the analyses 
adjusted for age, sex and ethnicity. This association decreased 
by 13% after adjustment for biological factors, by 24% after 
adjustment for health behaviours, by 8% after adjustment for 
depressive symptoms, by 33% after adjustment for socioeco-
nomic factors and by 9% after adjustment for chronic disease. In 
the final model adjusted for all risk factors, the association was 
attenuated by 50% to 1.25 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.51), but remained 
statistically significant (P=0.023).
Similarly, in the analyses adjusted for age, sex and ethnicity, 
social isolation was associated with higher risk of mortality 
after stroke (HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.83, P<0.001). This 
association decreased by 5% after adjustment for biological 
factors, by 24% after adjustment for health behaviours, by 7% 
after adjustment for depressive symptoms, by 26% after adjust-
ment for socioeconomic factors and by 7% after adjustment for 
chronic disease. Finally, the association attenuated by 38% to

(P=0.007), in the final model adjusted for all risk factors. Lone-
liness, in turn, was not associated with mortality among partic-
ipants who had incident AMI or stroke (online supplementary 
efigure 1).
sensitivity analyses
We performed a number of sensitivity analyses to examine the 
robustness of the findings. First, we examined the associations 
between social isolation and loneliness with AMI and stroke 
across potential confounders, that is, three age groups, sex and 
ethnicity. The results were consistent across three age groups 
and two ethnic groups, but the associations of social isolation 
and loneliness with AMI were slightly stronger in women than 
men (online supplementary efigures 2–3). Similarly, the associa-
tion between social isolation and stroke was slightly stronger in 
women (online supplementary efigure 3). Second, we performed 
complete case analyses where participants with missing values 
were excluded (322 818 participants had complete data on 
social isolation and all covariates; 315 231 participants had 
complete data on loneliness and all covariates). The results from 
the complete case analyses were similar to those previously 
reported (online supplementary efigures 4–5). Last, we analysed 
the associations between a single item of loneliness (“Do you

completely overlapping with the results from between loneliness 
with AMI and stroke (online supplementary efigure 6).
dIsCussIOn
The main finding of this UK Biobank study of 479 054 partici-
pants followed for over 7 years is that persons reporting social 
isolation and loneliness had 1.4-fold to 1.5-fold increased risk 
of incident AMI or stroke. However, approximately 85% of 
this excess risk was attributable to known risk factors such as 
obesity, smoking, low education and pre-existing chronic illness. 
In addition, social isolation, but not loneliness, was associated 
with 1.5-fold increased risk of mortality after the AMI or stroke 
event and although up to half of this excess risk was attributable 
to known risk factors, social isolation remained as an indepen-
dent risk factor for mortality after the AMI and stroke event.
Our findings are in agreement with the previous studies 
where social isolation and loneliness have been associated with 
increased all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality,3–7 and 
cardiovascular disease prognosis and incidence.24 Recent liter-
ature-based meta-analysis with 16 longitudinal studies showed 
that social isolation and loneliness are associated with 30% 
higher excess risk of stroke and cardiovascular heart disease 
after adjustment at least for age, gender and socioeconomic

status.8 Although these findings are of the same magnitude as 
ours before adjustment for risk factors and pre-existing chronic 
conditions, we were able to address the contribution of conven-
tional risk factors to the association and we found that the asso-
ciations were to a large extent attributable to these conventional 
risk factors. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the 
largest study on the topic. Differences between our findings and 
previous results could be related to study design or to selective 
publishing of positive results, which was suggested in the recent 
literature-based meta-analysis.8 In addition, it is possible that 
some of these adjustments lead to an underestimation of the true 
effect size, as social isolation and loneliness have been associ-
ated with many of these risk factors—such as depression25—and, 
thus, some of the mediators could also be confounders.
In our previous UK Biobank study with all-cause and cause-spe-
cific mortality as an outcome, we found similarly that the associ-
ation between loneliness and cardiovascular mortality was fully 
explained by explanatory mechanisms, whereas the association 
between social isolation and all-cause mortality remained more 
independent.7 Thus, it seems that the association between social 
isolation and prognosis after a cardiovascular event is stronger 
than the association between loneliness and cardiovascular 
health. These findings indicate that social isolation, similarly 
to other risk factors such as depression,15 can be regarded as a 
risk factor for poor prognosis of individuals with cardiovascular 
disease.
Social isolation and loneliness can be seen as markers for 
many conventional risk factors—such as unhealthy lifestyles, 
poor mental health and socioeconomic adversity—and these 
risk factors also explain the association of social isolation and 
loneliness with cardiovascular morbidity. Thus, public health 
policies addressing conventional risk factors might also reduce 
the cardiovascular morbidity related to social isolation and lone-
liness. Further attention to social connections in public health 
prevention and intervention programmes could also potentially 
reduce the negative health outcomes of social isolation and 
loneliness. Importantly, guidance on how to address health risks 
associated with social isolation and loneliness could be added to 
the education of healthcare professionals,26 to promote preven-
tion and treatment of cardiovascular disease in individuals with 
poor social connections.
strengths and limitations
The UK Biobank is a large-scale prospective cohort study that 
provided a unique opportunity to examine our research question. 
Main outcomes (AMI, stroke and mortality) were acquired from 
health registers, and exposures (social isolation and loneliness) were 
self-reported. Social isolation was measured with three items and 
loneliness with two items. As it has been shown that multi-item 
assessment of social isolation has better predictive validity than 
single-item measures,4 multi-item assessment of social isolation and 
loneliness would have been a better option. Unfortunately, more 
items related to social isolation or loneliness were not available from 
the UK Biobank data. Although the response rate to UK Biobank 
was only 5.5%, the participants are representative of the general 
population with respect to age, sex, ethnicity and deprivation within 
the recruitment age range.27 If the drop-out is non-random and 
related to social isolation or loneliness, this could bias the results 
leading either overestimates or underestimates of the studied asso-
ciations. These issues, however, do not affect generalisability of our 
results as population prevalence and incidence rates were not the 
target of our study. Reverse causality—which previous studies have 
demonstrated28—could bias our findings. However, participants 
with cardiovascular disease or stroke events before the study base-
line were excluded from the analysis. As only the date of the first 
cardiovascular disease or stroke event is currently available from 
the UK Biobank data, we were not able to examine the association 
between social isolation and loneliness with recurrent cardiovas-
cular disease stroke or events. This issue is likely to be important, 
as around one-fourth of strokes are recurrent,12 and social isolation 
before stroke has been shown to predict poorer outcomes after 
stroke.29 However, our results showed that social isolation is asso-
ciated with increased risk of mortality after AMI or stroke event, 
indicating that social isolation is associated with poorer prognosis 
after AMI or stroke. Although we measured only social networks 
in a very simple way, studies using more complex measures have 
reported similar findings.2 Naturally, there is a possibility of residual 
confounding that cannot be completely ruled out in an observational 
study. UK Biobank included participants aged between 40 and 69, 
hence current findings may not be generalised beyond this age range.

to elevated mortality after the incidence of AMI or stroke. 
However, although these associations are largely explained by 
other cardiovascular health risk factors and pre-existing chronic 
conditions, social isolation seems to remain as an independent 
risk factor for mortality after the AMI and stroke event.
Key messages
What is already known on this subject?
 
► Social isolation and loneliness have been associated with 
higher risk of cardiovascular disease and poorer prognosis, 
but it remains unclear whether these associations are 
independent of conventional risk factors.
What might this study add?
 
► In this population-based cohort study of over 470 000 
participants, most of the excess risk of cardiovascular disease 
and death after the cardiovascular event among isolated and 
lonely persons was explained by conventional risk factors.
how might this impact on clinical practice? 
 
► Targeting conventional risk factors could reduce 
cardiovascular disease burden among isolated and lonely 
individuals.
