 In 2002, Caspi and colleagues published a paper examining the role
of the monoamine oxidase A gene (MAOA) in the development of
antisocial behaviours.1 This research was motivated by earlier
evidence suggesting that carriers of the low-activity variant of
MAOA were an at-risk group for criminality and violence.2–4
Using data from the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and
Development Study (DMHDS) Caspi et al were able to show
consistent
gene6environment
(G6E)
interactions
between
exposures to childhood maltreatment and MAOA genotype in
the development of antisocial behaviours. Their findings showed
that associations between childhood maltreatment and antisocial
behaviour were modified by MAOA, with those having the low-
activity
variant
being
more
responsive
to
the
effects
of
maltreatment than the high-activity group.
These results attracted considerable interest and a number of
attempts have been made to replicate the findings of this
study.5–14 As has been the case with other research into G6E
interactions in the area of psychosocial adjustment,15,16 findings
have been mixed, with a number of studies confirming the original
findings,10–13,15–22 other studies finding no interaction14,23–26 and
some studies finding effects in the reverse direction, with some
reversals being observed only among females.9,17,18,27 However, a
meta-analysis of five studies reported by Kim-Cohen et al8 found
evidence for a consistent G 6 E effect involving MAOA and child
maltreatment. These conclusions were supported by a further
meta-analysis of eight studies by Taylor and Kim-Cohen.15 Such
findings raise important issues about the stability and replicability
of G 6 E interactions. Specifically, it may be argued that failures
to replicate G 6 E interactions across studies reflect between-
study variations in research design and measurement methods
rather than an absence of G 6 E interaction. Alternatively, failure
to replicate findings may reflect an absence of a stable G 6 E
association.16,17
In a previous paper18 we attempted to address issues of cross-
study replication by using data from a study that has strong simi-
larities to the DMHDS in terms of geographical region, research
design and measurement methods to replicate and extend the
findings of Caspi et al.19 In that analysis we examined the
relationship
between
the
serotonin
transporter
promoter
polymorphism (5-HTTLPR), life stress and mental disorder.
Despite extensive attempts to replicate the findings of Caspi et al,
we were unable to locate a replicable G6E interaction between
5-HTTLPR and life stress. In this paper we extend the approach
used in our earlier paper to examine the G6E interaction effects
between MAOA, childhood maltreatment and the development of
antisocial behaviour. The specific aims of this analysis were to
examine the extent to which there is a stable G6E interaction
between MAOA, childhood maltreatment and a series of measures
of antisocial behaviour including: adolescent conduct disorder;
self-reported crime in adolescence and adulthood; officially
recorded convictions for offending; and self-reported hostility.
Method
Sample
The data were gathered during the course of the Christchurch
Health and Development Study (CHDS). In this study a birth
cohort of 1265 children born in the Christchurch (New Zealand)
urban region in mid-1977 has been studied at birth, 4 months, 1
year and annually to age 16 years, and again at 18, 21, 25 and 30
years.20,21 Sample retention rates were high throughout the study

MAOA, abuse exposure and antisocial behaviour:
30-year longitudinal study
David M. Fergusson, Joseph M. Boden, L. John Horwood, Allison L. Miller and Martin A. Kennedy
Background
Recent studies have raised issues concerning the replicability
of gene 6 environment (G 6 E) interactions involving the
monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene in moderating the
associations between abuse or maltreatment exposure
and antisocial behaviour. This study attempted to replicate
the findings in this area using a 30-year longitudinal study
that has strong resemblance to the original research
cohort.
Aims
To test the hypothesis that the presence of the low-activity
MAOA genotype was associated with an increased response
to abuse exposure.
Method
Participants were 398 males from the Christchurch Health
and Development Study who had complete data on: MAOA
promoter region variable number tandem repeat genotype;
antisocial behaviour to age 30; and exposure to childhood
sexual and physical abuse.
Results
Regression models were fitted to five antisocial behaviour
outcomes (self-reported property offending; self-reported
violent offending; convictions for property/violent offending;
conduct problems; hostility) observed from age 16
to 30, using measures of childhood exposure to sexual and
physical abuse. The analyses revealed consistent evidence of
G 6 E interactions, with those having the low-activity MAOA
variant and who were exposed to abuse in childhood being
significantly more likely to report later offending, conduct
problems and hostility. These interactions remained
statistically significant after control for a range of potentially
confounding factors. Findings for convictions data were
somewhat weaker.
Conclusions
The present findings add to the evidence suggesting that
there is a stable G 6 E interaction involving MAOA, abuse
exposure and antisocial behaviour across the life course.

 and at age 30 the study was still able to assess over 80% of the
surviving cohort. All phases of the study were subject to ethical
approval from the Canterbury Regional Health and Disability
Ethics Committee, and all forms of data collection were subject
to the signed consent of study participants. The present analysis
is based on a sample of 398 male cohort members who were as-
sessed on antisocial behaviour outcomes in late adolescence and
early adulthood (ages 16–30 years) and who were successfully
genotyped for MAOA. This sample represented 65% of the
surviving cohort of males.
DNA preparation
Between the ages of 28 and 30, participants were asked to provide
a peripheral blood sample for DNA analysis: 446 male participants
agreed, with most (91%) providing a blood sample from which
DNA was extracted using a sodium chloride precipitation
procedure. For the remaining participants, saliva was collected
using Oragene collection kits (DNA Genotek, Ottawa, Canada)
and DNA was extracted according to the supplier’s instructions.
MAOA genotyping
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed essentially as
described by Sabol et al25 and Caspi et al.1 Reactions were carried
out on an Eppendorf MasterCycler-EP using the primers MAO
APT1 (5’-ACAGCCTGACCGTGGAGAAG-3’) and MAO APB1
(5’-GAACGGACGCTCCATTCGGA-3’) (Invitrogen). The MAO
APT1 was 5’-labelled with the FAM fluorophore. The PCR
conditions were as follows: initial 2 min denaturing step at
958C, followed by 35 cycles of 948C for 30 s, 608C for 30 s and
728C for 40 s and a final extension phase of 728C for 5 min.
Reactions were performed in 10 ml volume using PCR buffer with
1.5 mM MgCl2 (Roche), ~50 ng of genomic DNA, 500 nM of each
primer, 200 mM of each dNTP (Fisher Biotec) and 0.5 units of
Taq-TI (Fisher Biotec). The PCR products were assayed on an
Applied Biosystems 3130xl genetic analyser, set to fragment
analysis mode, using POP7 polymer (Applied Biosystems) and
GeneScan 500 LIZ (Applied Biosystems) size standard. Results
were analysed using GeneMapper v4.0 for Windows (Applied
Biosystems). On the basis of this genotyping, 150 cohort members
were classified as having the low-activity MAOA genotype (one
individual had 2.5, the rest had 3 repeats) whereas 249 cohort
members were classified as having the high-activity MAOA
genotype (3.5, 4 or 5 repeats). The ‘MAOA activity – allele repeat
length’ grouping was essentially as described and justified by Caspi
et al.1 It should be noted that additional analyses in which the nine
male cohort members with five repeats were classified as the low-
activity genotype1 revealed the same pattern of results as those
presented below.
Abuse exposure
The following measures were used to assess the extent of exposure
to sexual/physical abuse during childhood. Preliminary analyses
revealed no evidence of statistically significant genotype6abuse
exposure interactions.
Childhood sexual abuse
Exposure to childhood sexual abuse was assessed on the basis of
retrospective reports obtained at 18 and 21 years. Participants
were questioned about their experience of a range of 15 abusive
experiences prior to age 16 and, for each incident reported, further
detail was gathered on the nature and context of the abuse.22,24 On
the basis of this questioning participants were classified into four
groups reflecting the most severe form of abuse reported at either
age: no childhood sexual abuse; non-contact childhood sexual
abuse (for example indecent exposure, lewd or threatening
sexual comments); contact childhood sexual abuse involving
inappropriate touching of genital areas; attempted/completed
sexual penetration.
Childhood physical abuse
Exposure to childhood physical abuse was assessed on the basis of
retrospective reports obtained at 18 and 21 years of the extent to
which the participant’s parent(s) were reported to have used
methods
of
physical
punishment
during
childhood
(516
years).22,25 For the purposes of the present analysis participants
were classified into three groups reflecting the severity of physical
punishment experienced during childhood. These groups were:
parents never or rarely used physical punishment; at least one
parent regularly used physical punishment; at least one parent
used frequent, severe or harsh physical punishment.
Exposure to significant childhood sexual abuse
or childhood physical abuse
In order to create a measure of exposure to significant childhood
sexual abuse and childhood physical abuse, cohort members who
were exposed to either (a) any form of sexual abuse (non-contact
or contact abuse) or (b) either regular or harsh/severe levels of
physical punishment, were classified as having been exposed to
significant childhood sexual abuse or childhood physical abuse.
In addition, analyses were conducted using either the measure
of ‘any sexual abuse’ or ‘regular or harsh/severe physical
punishment’ individually (see below).
Interparental violence
In addition to the above, a measure of exposure to interparental
violence was also used. This was assessed at age 18 using selected
items from the Conflict Tactics Scale27 to assess the extent to
which the participant had witnessed incidents of interparental
conflict and physical violence during childhood. These items were
combined to form a scale measure reflecting the extent of
interparental violence.26
Antisocial behaviour outcomes
The following measures were used to assess antisocial behaviour
outcomes during the period 16–30 years.
Self-reported property/violent offending, aged 16–30
At 18, 21, 25 and 30 years, respondents were questioned about
their criminal behaviour since the previous assessment using an
instrument based on the Self-Report Delinquency Inventory
(SRDI)28 supplemented by additional custom-written survey
items. This information was used to derive count measures of
the number of self-reported property and/or violent offences
committed in each year from age 16 to 30. Property offences were
defined
to include
theft,
burglary,
breaking
and entering,
vandalism, fire-setting and related offences; violent offences
included assault, fighting, use of a weapon or threats of violence
against a person. For the purposes of the present analyses, the
number of offences committed in each year was summed over
the period 16–30 years to create two overall scores reflecting the
total number of property and violent offences. Total scores were
truncated to a maximum of 100 to avoid the influence of outliers
on the data.

Fergusson et al
 MAOA, abuse exposure and antisocial behaviour
Officially recorded property/violence convictions, aged 17–21
Data on convictions over the period 17–21 years were obtained
from records held by the New Zealand police. These records were
obtained following signed and informed consent from the young
person. Of the 1011 cohort members asked for permission to
search their police records, 97.3% provided permission and
2.7% declined. For each participant, a record of the date of arrest,
type of offence, date of court appearance, number of convictions
and sentence was gathered. For the purposes of the present
analysis, data on convictions were classified to provide a measure
of convictions for property or violent offences. Property offences
included theft, burglary, breaking and entering, wilful damage,
fire-setting and related offences. Violent offences included assault,
fighting, robbery, use of a weapon, threats of violence against a
person and similar offences. The number of convictions for each
type of offence were then summed over the period to create an
index of the number of property and violent convictions during
the period 17–21 years.
Conduct problems, aged 14–16
At 15 and 16 years sample members were interviewed on a
comprehensive mental health interview that examined aspects of
mental health and adjustment over the previous 12 months. A
parallel interview was also conducted with the child’s mother.
The two interviews were conducted at different sites (mothers
were interviewed at home and children at school) and by different
interviewers. As part of the assessments at each age information
was obtained on DSM-III-R29 symptom criteria for conduct
disorder30 using the Self-Report Early Delinquency (SRED)
scale.31 For the purpose of the present analyses, these responses
were used to create a continuous scale measure reflecting the
number of symptom criteria reported for each disorder. This
measure was based on a count of the number of symptoms of
disorder reported by either the mother or child over the 2-year
period.
Hostility, aged 18, 21 and 25
At 18, 21 and 25 years, items from the 90-item Symptom Checklist
(SCL-90)32 were used to assess aspects of current psychiatric
symptomatology. Part of this assessment included the hostility
subscale of the SCL-90. The hostility subscale comprised a series
of six items relating to hostile thoughts and behaviours including:
feeling easily annoyed or irritated; temper outbursts that could not
be controlled; having urges to beat, injure or harm someone;
having urges to smash or break things; getting into frequent
arguments; and shouting or throwing things. For each item the
individual was asked to report the extent to which they had been
troubled by the symptom over the past month. Ratings were made
on a 3-point scale (not at all, a little, a great deal), and for each
participant a total hostility scale score was computed at each age
by summing the scores on each of the six items. The resulting scale
scores were of moderate reliability (a = 0.77–0.79). These scores
were averaged over the three assessment periods to create a mean
hostility score for the period 18–25 years, scaled to a mean of 100
and a standard deviation of 10.
Covariate factors
A range of covariate factors were chosen for the analyses, based
on: their correlation with abuse exposure; and previous research
on the present cohort suggesting that the factors were related to
antisocial behaviour. The following covariate factors were chosen
for inclusion in the analyses.
Sociodemographic background
(a) Maternal age: maternal age was assessed at the time of the
survey child’s birth.
(b) Paternal education: paternal education was assessed at the
time of the survey child’s birth using a 3-point scale that
reflected the highest level of educational achievement attained.
This
scale
was:
1,
father
lacked
formal
educational
qualifications (had not graduated from high school); 2,
father had secondary-level educational qualifications (had
graduated from high school); 3, father had tertiary-level
qualifications (had obtained a university degree or equivalent
qualification).
(c) Family living standards (0–10 years): each year a global
assessment of the material living standards of the family was
obtained by means of an interviewer rating. Ratings were
made on a 5-point scale that ranged from ‘very good’ to
‘very poor’. These ratings were summed over the 10-year
period and divided by 10 to give a measure of typical family
living standards during this period.
(d) Family socioeconomic status (at birth and at age 14): this was
assessed at the time of the survey child’s birth, and again at age
14 using the Elley–Irving33 scale of socioeconomic status for
New Zealand. This scale classifies socioeconomic status into
six levels on the basis of paternal occupation ranging from
1, professional occupations to 6, unskilled occupations.
Family functioning
(a) Family adversity measure: an index of family problems was
calculated using a count of 38 different measures of family
disadvantage
during
the
period
0–15
years,
including
measures
of
disadvantaged
parental
background,
poor
prenatal
health
practices
and
perinatal
outcomes,
and
disadvantageous child-rearing practices.34
(b) Parental alcoholism/alcohol problems, criminal offending and
illicit drug use: when sample members were aged 11, their
parents were questioned about parental use of illicit drugs.
At the 15-year assessment parents were further questioned
concerning their history of alcoholism or alcohol problems
and criminal offending. On the basis of this questioning
11.9% of the sample were classified as having a parental
history of alcoholism/alcohol problems, 12.4% of the sample
as having a parental history of criminal offending and 24.9%
as having a parental history of illicit drug use.
(c) Changes of parents: as part of the annual assessments from age
1–16 years information was obtained on changes of parents
since the previous assessment. An overall measure of family
stability during childhood was developed based on a count
of the number of changes of parents experienced by the
child from birth to age 16 years. This count included all
changes
as
a
result
of
parental
separation/divorce,
reconciliation,
remarriage/cohabitation,
parental
death,
fostering and other changes of custodial parents.
Individual factors
Child cognitive ability was assessed at the ages of 8 and 9 using the
Revised Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-R)35 Total
scores were computed on the basis of results on four verbal and
four performance subscales. The split half reliabilities of these
scores were 0.93 at age 8 and 0.95 at age 9. For the purposes of
these analyses the observed WISC-R total IQ scores at age 8 and
9 were combined by averaging over the two administrations.
459
 Fergusson et al
Statistical analysis
The data were analysed using Poisson regression models (with
correction for overdispersion) in the case of count measures
(property/violent offending; convictions; conduct problems),
and multiple regression with maximum likelihood estimation
for the hostility score measure, using SAS version 9.01 for
Windows. These models were of the form:
f(Y) = B0 + B1(maoa) + B2(abuse) + B3(maoa6abuse)
where f(Y) was either the log rate (for count measures) of the
antisocial behaviour outcome, or the score on the hostility
measure; maoa was the dichotomous measure of MAOA activity
genotype
(low
activity/high
activity);
and
abuse
was
the
dichotomous measure of exposure to significant sexual or physical
abuse in childhood. The interaction term was centred around the
mean for the abuse exposure measure. In this model the
coefficient B1 represents the main effect of genotype; B2 the main
effect of abuse exposure; and B3 the change in the effect of abuse
exposure attributable to having the low- or high-activity MAOA
genotype, and B0 was the intercept term. With the model
formulated in this way a negative B3 coefficient would be
consistent with the Caspi et al1 hypothesis of greater responsivity
to abuse among those with lower MAOA activity levels. The test
of significance of the interaction effect was based on the standard
Z-test given by the ratio of the regression parameter B3 to its
standard error (or t-test in the case of the analyses of the hostility
scores). In order to account for any potential issues arising from
the ethnic stratification of the sample, the analyses were then
repeated omitting the 47 cohort members of Maori, Pacific Island
and Asian ethnicity.
Then, to examine the sensitivity of the analyses to alternative
methods of conceptualising abuse exposure, the above analyses
were repeated using, in place of the measure of exposure to
significant sexual or physical abuse in childhood: a dichotomous
measure of sexual abuse (abuse/no abuse); a dichotomous
measure of physical abuse (no physical punishment or occasional
punishment/regular or severe physical punishment); and a
dichotomous measure representing the highest decile on the
measure of interparental violence exposure (no/yes).
In the next step of the analyses, the values of the Z-tests of
significance of the interaction terms were plotted separately for
the models using either sexual or physical abuse, or sexual or
physical abuse alone, using Stata 10.0 for Windows.
In addition, to examine the extent to which the interactions
between abuse exposure and MAOA in predicting antisocial
behaviour could be accounted for by potentially confounding
factors, the models described above were extended to include
terms representing the effects of the range of confounding factors
described above. These models were of the general form:
f(Y) = B0 + B1(maoa) + B2(abuse) + B3(maoa 6 abuse) + SBjXj
where f(Y), maoa, and abuse were as described above, and where
SBjXj represented the pooled effects of the sociodemographic,
family functioning and individual factors noted above. All
confounding factors were entered into the models simultaneously.

 MAOA, abuse exposure and antisocial behaviour
abuse; and other participants. Table 1 is further stratified by
MAOA genotype into high- and low-activity groups. For each
combination of childhood maltreatment and genotype the table
reports measures of five outcomes: rates of self-reported violent
and property crimes during the period 16–30 years; rates of
officially recorded property or violent convictions during the
period 17–21 years; rates of conduct disorder symptoms during
the period 14–16 years; and standardised hostility scores derived
from the SCL-90 (see Method). For each outcome, tests of the
main effects of childhood maltreatment, genotype and a centred
test of the genotype6maltreatment interaction are reported. Also,
in order to account for potential issues arising from ethnic
stratification, the Table also shows the parameter estimates derived
from models omitting those cohort members of Maori, Pacific
Island and Asian ethnicity (n = 47). The table shows the following
results.
(a) For self-reported violent and property crimes (16–30 years),
there was a clear tendency for genotype to modify the relation-
ship between childhood maltreatment and offending, with
those having the low-activity genotype being more responsive
to maltreatment than the high genotype. In both cases there
was a significant (P50.05) G6E interaction. In addition,
there was evidence of significant main effects for both child-
hood maltreatment (P50.001) and genotype (P50.01).
(b) For officially recorded convictions (17–21 years) there was no
clear tendency for genotype to modify the relationship
between
childhood
maltreatment
and
offending.
This
conclusion was confirmed by the absence of a significant
(P40.40)
G6E
interaction
between
maltreatment
and
MAOA. There was, however, a significant main effect for
both
genotype
(P50.05)
and
childhood
maltreatment
(P50.001) reflecting the fact that those with the low activity
MAOA genotype and those reporting significant maltreatment
had higher rates of conviction.
(c) For symptoms of conduct disorder (14–16 years) there was a
clear tendency for genotype to modify the relationship
between childhood maltreatment and offending, with those
having the low-activity genotype being more responsive to
childhood maltreatment This conclusions was confirmed by
the presence of a significant (P50.05) G6E interaction
between maltreatment and the MAOA genotype. There was
also a significant main effect for childhood maltreatment
(P50.001) and for MAOA (P50.01).
(d) For SCL-90 symptoms of hostility there was a clear tendency
for genotype to modify the relationship between childhood
maltreatment and offending, with those having the low-activity
MAOA
genotype
being
more
responsive
to
childhood
maltreatment. This conclusion was confirmed by the presence
of a significant (P50.05) interaction between childhood
maltreatment and MAOA activity level. In addition there
was a significant main effect for childhood maltreatment
(P50.001) but not for MAOA activity level.
(e) For each outcome measure, the analyses omitting those cohort
members of Maori, Pacific and Asian ethnicity (n = 47)
revealed a similar set of parameter estimates. For the measures
of violent crime, property crime and conduct problems, these
analyses yielded somewhat stronger parameter estimates for
the interaction between MAOA activity level and maltreatment,
whereas for convictions and hostility scores, the parameter
estimates for the MAOA6maltreatment interaction terms
were somewhat weaker. As with the models using the full
sample, however, four out of the five interaction terms were
statistically significant (P50.05).
With the possible exception of findings for officially recorded
convictions from age 17 to 21, Table 1 suggests the presence of a
consistent G6E interaction in which those with the low-activity
variant of MAOA were more likely to develop antisocial
behaviours following responses to maltreatment.
Extensions and further analysis
The analysis in Table 1 was replicated using specific measures of
childhood sexual abuse and childhood physical abuse (see
Method). The results of these analyses are depicted in Fig. 1, which
shows plots of the Z-test of the G6E interaction for three series of
analysis: the results shown in Table 1; the results obtained using a
measure of childhood sexual abuse only; and the results obtained
using a measure of childhood physical abuse only. The figure
shows evidence of consistent G6E effects for all measures of
childhood maltreatment. For three of the five outcome measures
there are consistently significant (P50.05) G6E interactions,
with the sign of the Z-test indicating that in all cases those with
the low-activity genotype were more likely to report antisocial
behaviour following exposure to maltreatment. The exceptions
to this trend were: the measure of conduct problems, which was
significant (P50.05) for both the overall measure of maltreatment
exposure and for sexual abuse exposure; and officially recorded
convictions, which was significant (P50.05) only for sexual

abuse exposure. However, it is notable that in all cases the sign of
the Z-test was negative, suggesting a general but non-significant
trend for those with the low-activity genotype to have higher rates
of conviction following exposure to maltreatment.
To examine the robustness of the findings in Table 1 and Fig. 1,
these analyses were extended in a number of ways. These included
the following measures.
(a) Using a measure of interparental violence as the measure of
exposure to childhood maltreatment (see Method). These
analyses failed to show any evidence of a main effect for
exposure to interparental violence (all P40.05), suggesting
that exposure to interparental violence was not associated
with increased rates of antisocial behaviour outcomes.
(b) Statistical control for confounding factors including measures
of: sociodemographic disadvantage, family dysfunction, and
adverse
individual
factors
(see
Method).

Discussion
Main findings
In this paper we have attempted to replicate the findings of Caspi
et al1 on the G6E interaction between exposure to childhood
maltreatment and MAOA activity genotype in the development
of antisocial behaviours, using a study that has strong similarities
to the DMHDS. The findings of this analysis provided replication
and support for the original research. Specifically, we were able to
show significant G6E interactions between MAOA and childhood
maltreatment for a series of outcomes spanning adolescence to
adulthood,
and
involving
both
self-reported
and
officially
reported outcomes. Those with the low-activity variant of MAOA
who were exposed to maltreatment in childhood were significantly
more likely to report a range of antisocial behaviours and related
outcomes, including property and violent offending, hostility and
symptoms of conduct disorder. It should be noted that, for
officially
recorded convictions,
the
present
study
found
a
significant interaction between MAOA and only one of three
measures of maltreatment (sexual abuse). The weaker effects for
convictions are likely to reflect both the limited time period over
which officially recorded convictions were recorded, and the low
base rate of convictions in the cohort. Furthermore, officially
recorded convictions are not a ‘pure’ measure of antisocial
behaviour since they measure both the individual’s offending
behaviour and the responses of the criminal justice system to this
behaviour.36,37 Overall, however, the results of these analyses
suggest the presence of a robust and general tendency for
respondents with the low-activity variant of MAOA to be more
responsive to childhood maltreatment in terms of their rates of
subsequent antisocial behaviour.
Comparison with findings from other studies
Given the methodological similarities between the CHDS and the
DMHDS the present findings provide a replication of Caspi et al’s1
G6E findings involving MAOA and childhood maltreatment.
There were, however, some points of difference between our
findings and those of Caspi et al.1 First, whereas Caspi et al found
no evidence for a main effect of MAOA on antisocial behaviour,
we found a general tendency for the overall rate of antisocial
behaviour to be higher in the low-activity MAOA group than in
the high-activity group independent of the MAOA6maltreatment
interaction, with a statistically significant (P50.05) main effect
for MAOA for three outcomes. A limited number of studies have
found
a
main
effect
for
MAOA
on
later
antisocial
behaviour,5,12,14,38,39 but the majority of studies in this area have
not observed this main effect. If this main effect is replicated
in
further
studies
it
may
suggest
that,
independently
of
environmental effects, those with low-activity MAOA are more
prone to antisocial behaviours. Second, the present study also
found a statistically significant G6E interaction for conduct
problems, whereas Caspi et al1 found only a marginally significant
interaction. These differences in findings may largely reflect varia-
tions in measurement; whereas Caspi et al used diagnoses of con-
duct disorder, the present study employed a measure of the
number of symptoms of conduct disorder.
This is the second study in which we have attempted to
replicate the G 6 E findings reported by Caspi et al, with very
different results.18 In our first study, looking at the relationship
between 5-HTTLPR, life stress and mental disorder, we were
unable to find any evidence to support the hypothesis that
possession of
‘s’ alleles
was associated
with
an increased
responsivity to adverse life events.18 These findings are consistent
with a growing number of studies that have failed to replicate
the 5-HTTLPR findings.16,17 In complete contrast, the present
study has been able to provide a strong replication of the
MAOA6childhood maltreatment interaction. The most plausible
reason for these differences in findings is that the magnitude of the
interactions between MAOA and maltreatment are much stronger
than the interactions between 5-HTTLPR and negative life events.
This is indicated by the fact that MAOA interactions have been
detected in samples of males ranging in size from 399 to 975.1,8
Therefore, problems of replication may be attributable to the
magnitude of interactions, and the problems associated with
replicating relatively weak interactions. Using the CHDS data, it
was not possible to replicate the interactions for 5-HTTLPR,
whereas it proved possible to replicate interactions for MAOA.
Implications
These results also highlight some of the potential problems of
G6E research into psychopathology based on single genes.
Although it does appear to be possible to identify stable G6E
interaction effects involving single genes, because of the small
effect sizes involved these interactions prove difficult to replicate,
as noted above. Also as the results on 5-HTTLPR illustrate, it
may be possible to generate false-positive findings.
These
considerations suggest that although early research into G6E
interaction involving single genes has been useful in focusing
research on the interaction between genes and environment, it is
time for the field to move beyond single gene studies and towards
a consideration of the ways in which multiple genes combine
with multiple environmental factors to influence individual
susceptibility to psychopathology.
Limitations
Although the results of this study provide support for the
notion of a G6E interaction between MAOA and childhood
maltreatment, several limitations need to be considered. First, it
is clear that, although the observed interactions were statistically
significant, they tended to be limited in magnitude, accounting
for only a small portion of the variance in the models. The small
magnitude of the interaction effects suggests that the contribution
462
 MAOA, abuse exposure and antisocial behaviour
of these interactions to antisocial behaviour, over and above the
main effect of maltreatment exposure, may be somewhat limited
in scope. Second, although the MAOA genotype is theoretically
related to MAOA expression, at least one study has failed to find
links between variations in MAOA genotype and MAOA levels in
the brain.40 This suggests that further research on the expression
of MAOA is needed in order to validate the role of the MAOA
genotype in antisocial behaviour.
