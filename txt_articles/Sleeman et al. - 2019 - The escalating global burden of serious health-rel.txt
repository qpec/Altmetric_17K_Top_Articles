Summary
Background Serious life-threatening and life-limiting illnesses place an enormous burden on society and health 
systems. Understanding how this burden will evolve in the future is essential to inform policies that alleviate suffering 
and prevent health system weakening. We aimed to project the global burden of serious health-related suffering 
requiring palliative care until 2060 by world regions, age groups, and health conditions.
Methods We projected the future burden of serious health-related suffering as defined by the Lancet Commission on 
Palliative Care and Pain Relief, by combining WHO mortality projections (2016–60) with estimates of physical and 
psychological symptom prevalence in 20 conditions most often associated with symptoms requiring palliative care. 
Projections were described in terms of absolute numbers and proportional change compared with the 2016 baseline 
data. Results were stratified by World Bank income regions and WHO geographical regions.
Findings By 2060, an estimated 48 million people (47% of all deaths globally) will die with serious health-related 
suffering, which represents an 87% increase from 26 million people in 2016. 83% of these deaths will occur in low-
income and middle-income countries. Serious health-related suffering will increase in all regions, with the largest 
proportional rise in low-income countries (155% increase between 2016 and 2060). Globally, serious health-related 
suffering will increase most rapidly among people aged 70 years or older (183% increase between 2016 and 2060). In 
absolute terms, it will be driven by rises in cancer deaths (16 million people, 109% increase between 2016 and 2060). 
The condition with the highest proportional increase in serious-related suffering will be dementia (6 million people, 
264% increase between 2016 and 2060).
Interpretation The burden of serious health-related suffering will almost double by 2060, with the fastest increases 
occurring in low-income countries, among older people, and people with dementia. Immediate global action to 
integrate palliative care into health systems is an ethical and economic imperative.

Introduction
Palliative care and the relief of suffering have been 
described as some of the most neglected dimensions of 
global health.1 In 2018, the Lancet Commission on 
Palliative Care and Pain Relief2 stated that no other 
important health intervention is as lacking or inequitably 
distributed as pain relief, the pillar of palliative care. 
Despite the 2014 World Health Assembly resolution3 
calling for all member states to develop, strengthen, and 
implement palliative care services as part of universal 
health coverage, such services re 
main underdeveloped or 
non-existent in many parts of the world. Currently, 
45% of countries have no access to palliative care.4
Access to palliative care is an emerging challenge 
and public health priority, crucial for global health. 
Patients with serious illness experience a substantial 
burden of suffer 
ing, with associated costs to society.5 
Improving health through the avoidance of suffering is 
an essential component of high-quality health systems 
and has the poten 
tial to generate economic benefits.6 
Evidence that investment in palliative care services can 
relieve suffering for patients and families, and save 
money for health systems and society as a whole, 
is increasing.7 This evi 
dence applies to high-income, 
middle-income, and low-income coun 
tries, where 
palliative care can be delivered frequently at lower cost 
than the alternatives, with more favourable patient-
reported outcomes.8,9
The integration of palliative care within health systems 
requires an understanding of population needs. Several 
epidemiological approaches have been developed to 
quantify population palliative care needs, all of which 
rely on mortality data.10–15 Approaches to estimate the 
population palliative care need include applying a fixed 
proportion to the total number of deaths in a population,10 
use of expert consensus to identify the causes of death

most likely to benefit from palliative care,11 and incor-
poration of information on hospital admissions or 
symptom preva 
lence in these assessments.11–13 Although 
these methods have been influential in terms of global 
advocacy, they have been applied mainly in high-income 
countries, with limited cross-national compari 
son.14 
WHO did a global palliative care needs assessment in 
2014. On the basis of mortality data for 12 relevant 
conditions, and by use of pain prevalence as an indicator 
of palliative care need, it was estimated that over 
20 million people worldwide required palliative care at 
the end of life.4 In 2018, the Lancet Commission on 
Palliative Care and Pain Relief2 described a new construct 
of serious health-related suffering, defined as suffering 
associated with a need for palliative care, and estimated 
the global burden using mortality data for 20 conditions, 
adjusted for the prevalence of both physical and psycho-
social symptoms. The Lancet Commission estimated that 
over 25 million people who died in 2015 (accounting for 
45% of all deaths) experienced serious health-related 
suffering, 80% of whom were in low-income and middle-
income countries (LMICs).
Planning effective and efficient health systems requires 
an understanding of both current and future population 
needs. Worldwide, a combination of population ageing 
and an increase in non-communicable diseases means 
that the total number of deaths is projected to increase 
from 57 million in 2016 to over 100 million in 2060,16 
which will result in an increase in the global need for 
palliative care, greater levels of unnecessary suffering, and 
will threaten vulnerable health systems. To generate data 
that will help health systems to anticipate and respond 
to future needs, our aim was to project the future global 
burden of serious health-related suffer 
ing requiring 
palliative care until 2060, and to identify the world regions, 
age groups, and health conditions for which suffering and 
palliative care need are expected to rise the most.
Methods
Study design
This study was a population-based projections study 
using secondary analysis of global mortality data. We 
projected the future burden of serious health-related 
suffering, as defined by the Lancet Commission on 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Palliative care can relieve suffering for patients and families, 
and save money for health systems and society. To direct 
effective health-care planning and policy development, it is 
essential to understand both the current and future level of 
palliative care need. We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, 
and CINAHL from inception to Oct 26, 2018, using search terms 
“palliative care” (and “terminal care”, “end of life care”) and 
“needs assessment”, without language restrictions, to identify 
population-based approaches to assess palliative care need. 
We examined the reference lists and citations for 15 relevant 
papers and searched relevant chapters of the Oxford Textbook of 
Palliative Medicine (fifth edition) and Textbook of Palliative 
Medicine and Supportive Care (second edition). We identified 
seven approaches to population-based assessment of palliative 
care need. In 2018, the Lancet Commission on Palliative Care and 
Pain Relief assessed the global need for palliative care through a 
new measure of serious health-related suffering that 
incorporates mortality data for 20 life-threatening and 
life-limiting health conditions with 15 corresponding symptoms. 
The Lancet Commission estimated that over 25 million people 
who died in 2015 experienced serious health-related suffering. 
No studies that projected the future global need for palliative 
care were identified. 
Added value of this study
We have produced the first worldwide projections of the future 
need for palliative care, based on serious health-related 
suffering. We have shown that the global burden caused by this 
type of suffering is projected to increase in both absolute and 
relative terms. By 2060, an estimated 48 million people 
(47% of all deaths globally) will die each year with serious 
health-related suffering, and 83% of these deaths will occur in 
low-income and middle-income countries, which represents an 
87% increase in global suffering compared with 2016. This 
increase is mainly driven by increases in the number of cancer 
deaths, with suffering projected to increase most rapidly 
among people with dementia. Low-income countries are 
projected to have the most dramatic rise in suffering 
(155% increase between 2016 and 2060, compared with 
87% in lower-middle income countries, 88% in upper-middle 
income countries, and 57% in high-income countries). Globally, 
the burden of serious health-related suffering is projected to 
increase most rapidly in people aged 70 years or older, with an 
increase among younger age groups, including children, 
expected in low-income countries.
Implications of all the available evidence
The global burden of serious health-related suffering requiring 
palliative care is projected to almost double by 2060, with the 
biggest proportional increase in low-income countries. In these 
countries, for every 100 people dying with serious health-related 
suffering in 2016, we estimate that there will be 250 people dying 
with serious health-related suffering in 2060. Without 
improvement in palliative care integration into health systems, as 
well as failure to relieve the suffering of millions of dying people, 
there will be increased pressure on already vulnerable health 
systems that will compound poverty through placing a greater 
burden on families and informal care. These data call for global 
policies to strengthen health-care systems through availability of 
essential drugs, staff training, public education, and support to 
communities, with a focus on the populations that will 
experience the fastest rise of suffering and need: those who live in 
low-income countries, older people, and people with dementia.

Palliative Care and Pain Relief,2 by combining WHO 
mortality projections from 2016 to 2060,16 with estimates 
of physical and psychological symptom prevalence in 
20 conditions. We modelled future estimates of suffering 
by World Bank income classification, WHO region, age, 
gender, and condition causing death.
Data sources
Mortality projections for the years 2016–60 were 
obtained from WHO’s website.16 These projections use 
the WHO Global Health Estimates,17 global cause-
specific mortality estimates from 2000 to 2016, as a 
baseline. WHO projections use a set of relatively simple 
models to project future mortality by cause, sex, age, 
and geographical region. They include the following 
socio-economic variables: average income measured as 
gross domestic product, average years of schooling 
(referred to as human capital), and time in years (a proxy

measure for the effect of technological change on health 
status). A fourth variable, smoking impact, is included 
in projections for malignant neoplasms, cardiovascular 
disease, and respiratory disease.18 Projection models are 
developed for men and women, and for six age groups, 
in ten cause-of-death clusters, adjusted according to 
historically observed cause-specific mortality trends.16,18,19 
For some causes of death, projection models take into 
account special circumstances (eg, the scale-up of 
antiretroviral coverage in HIV). Projected death rates 
are converted to absolute numbers of deaths using the 
median population projections of the World Population 
Prospects 2017
.20 Changes in the absolute number of 
future deaths are thus a function of mortality rates and 
of demographic change in the size and age structure of 
the population.

health conditions most often associated with palliative 
care needs and developed multipliers to estimate the 
proportion of people with each condition likely to 
experience serious health-related suffering. Relevant 
health conditions were major causes of death (according 
to WHO Global Health Estimates)17 that also typically 
cause serious health-related suffering; or common causes 
of serious health-related suffering even if the condition 
can be cured (eg, some malignancies), the person can 
recover (eg, serious injuries), the person might survive 
for 1 year or more with chronic severe disability (eg, 
cerebrovascular disease), the condition can be controlled 
for many years (eg, HIV
/AIDS), or has a slowly progressive 
course (eg, dementia). The resulting list was revised by 
senior physicians with palliative care expertise from 
LMICs, producing a final list of 20 health conditions most 
often associated with symptoms requiring palliative care. 
The multiplier is a percentage applied to the total number 
of deaths in each condition to calculate the number of 
decedents who need palliative care. Multipliers were based 
on empirical evidence of the prevalence of 11 physical and 
four psychological symptoms frequently associated with 
the need for palliative care and refined based on expert 
consensus (including experts from LMICs) to provide 
global averages. For example, the multiplier for malignant 
neoplasms is 90% (average worldwide), indicating that 
90% of all deaths with an underlying cause of malignant 
neoplasm would experience serious health-related 
suffering (table 1).21
We projected the future burden of serious health-related 
suffering from 2016 to 2060 in 5-year increments from 
2020 (for WHO regions, data were available only for 2016, 
2030, 2045, and 2060). The proportion of people dying 
with serious health-related suffering was calculated using 
the total number of projected deaths as the denominator. 
Projections were described in terms of absolute numbers 
and proportional change compared with the 2016 baseline 
data, for the global population, and separately for World 
Bank income regions (low income, lower-middle income, 
upper-middle income, and high income) and WHO 
regions (Africa, America, southeast Asia, Europe, eastern 
Mediterranean, and western Pacific), and by the condition 
causing death. The projected demographic structure 
associated with serious health-related suffering was 
described by age group (0–4 years, 5–14 years, 15–29 years, 
30–49 years, 50–69 years, and 70 years or older) and 
gender, in 2016, 2030, 2045, and 2060, for global and 
regional populations. For presentation, estimates were 
rounded to the nearest 1000.

Results
The global burden of seri 
ous health-related suffering 
requiring palliative care is projected to increase between 
2016 and 2060 in both absolute and relative terms. 
Globally, we estimated that the proportion of people dying 
with serious health-related suffering will increase from 
45% of all deaths in 2016 to 47% in 2060. In absolute 
terms, in 2060, more than 48 million people will die with 
serious-health related suffering, 22 million more people 
compared with 2016, which represents an 87% increase in 
the number of people suffering (figure 1, table 2).
The burden of serious health-related suffering is 
projected to increase in all World Bank income regions 
between 2016 and 2060. By 2060, LMICs will account for 
83% of serious health-related suffering (figure 1). Low-
income countries will have the largest proportional 
rise: the proportion of people who experience serious 
health-related suffering will increase from 38% of 
all deaths in 2016, to 42% in 2060. The proportion of 
people with serious health-related suffering will increase 
from 41% to 42% in lower-middle income countries, from 
50% to 52% in upper-middle income countries, and 
from 51% to 53% in high-income countries. In absolute 
terms, over 3 million more people will die in low-income 
countries with serious health-related suffering in 2060 
compared with 2016, an increase of 155%. The highest 
absolute level of serious health-related suffering will occur 
in lower-middle and upper-middle income countries, with 
each region having 8 million more people with serious 
health-related suffering in 2060 compared with 2016. In 
high-income countries, almost 3 million more people 
will die with serious health-related suffering in 2060, an 
increase of 57% compared with 2016 (figure 2). In high-
income countries the rise in serious health-related 
suffering is expected to slow down and plateau around 
2050. By contrast, in low-income and lower-middle 
income countries, the burden of serious health related 
suffering will continue to increase (figure 1).
An increase in the burden of serious health-related 
suffering between 2016 and 2060, will occur in all WHO 
regions, with the highest proportional increases in 
the eastern Mediterranean (170% increase) and African 
(126% increase) regions. In absolute terms, the burden 
of serious health-related suffering will increase most in 
the western Pacific region (over 6 million more people 
in 2060, 87% increase compared with 2016; appendix p 3).
Globally, the burden of serious health-related suffering 
is projected to increase most rapidly in the oldest age 
group (≥70 years), with over 22 million more people in 
this group experiencing serious health-related suffering 
in 2060 compared with 2016 (183% increase; figure 3, 
appendix p 4). The shift of serious health-related suffering 
towards older age will occur in all regions but is most 
marked in low-income countries, where the number of 
people older than 70 years with serious health-related 
suffering will increase by more than 400% between 2016 
and 2060 (compared with 243% in lower-middle income 
countries, 189% in upper-middle income countries, and 
97% in high-income countries; calculated from appendix 
p 4). The shift towards the oldest age group in low-income 
countries will occur later than in higher-income countries, 
with a relatively greater increase between 2045 and 2060 
than in higher-income countries (figure 4, appendix p 4). 
Globally, suffering is projected to decrease among 
younger age groups (0–4 years, 5–14 years, 15–29 years, 
and 30–49 years), except in low-income countries 
(5% increase in serious health-related suffering among 
children aged 5–14 years, between 2016 and 2060). Serious 
health-related suffering among infants (aged 0–4 years) 
will decline in all World Bank regions. For the age 
distribution of serious health-related suffering in WHO 
regions, see appendix (pp 5, 6).
Worldwide, the conditions contributing most to the 
increase in serious health-related suffering are ma

and dementia (figure 5), with malignant neoplasms 
accounting for the highest number of deaths. We project 
that, by 2060, over 16 million people per year will die 
from malignant neoplasms and experience serious 
health-related suffering. This increase represents over 
8 million more people (or double) compared with 2016. 
The condition with the largest proportional rise from 
2016 to 2060 is dementia: the global burden of serious 
health-related suffering in dementia will increase from 
1·5 million in 2016 to almost 6 million in 2060, a 4-fold 
increase. For other conditions, the global burden of 
serious health-related suffering is expected to decline. 
For example, the number of people with HIV dying with 
serious health-related suffering worldwide is expected to 
reduce from more than 1 million people in 2016 to less 
than 400 000 people in 2060 (figure 5, appendix p 7).
Across all World Bank income regions, an increase in 
deaths due to malignant neoplasms will be the biggest 
driver of serious health-related suffering from 2016 to 2060 
(figure 6, appendix pp 8, 9). In relative terms, this increase 
will be most apparent in low-income countries, where 
the absolute burden of serious health-related suffering 
associated with malignant neoplasms will increase from 
300 000 people in 2016 to 1·6 million people in 2060, 
a 5-fold increase. The burden of dementia-associated 
suffering will increase 4-fold in low-income countries, 
from fewer than 50 000 people in 2016 to more than 
200 000 in 2060. By contrast, HIV (the second highest 
driver of serious health-related suffering in low-income 
countries in 2016, after malignant neoplasms) will 
become the tenth highest contributor to serious health-
related suffering in 2060, which reflects a reduction in 
HIV-related palliative care need from 300 000 people 
in 2016, to 120 000 in 2060. Suffering associated with 
tuberculosis is projected to decline in all income regions, 
except low-income coun 
tries, where it will continue to 
increase until 2060. For conditions driving increases in 
serious health-related suffering in WHO regions, see 
appendix (pp 10–13).
Discussion
This study provides the first worldwide projections of 
serious health-related suffering and sends alarming 
messages for global health. We show that the global 
burden of serious health-related suffering requiring 
palliative care will increase in both absolute and relative 
terms. We estimate that 48 million people will die 
experiencing serious health-related suffering by 2060, 
compared with 26 million people in 2016. This increase 
means that the absolute number of world citizens in 
need of palliative care will almost double over the next 
four decades. The most rapid increases will occur in low-
income countries, among people older than 70 years, and 
those with dementia. In relative terms, serious health-
related suffering will become more prevalent in all world 
regions, meaning that a higher proportion of people will 
suffer before they die.
Palliative care is increasingly recognised by inter 
national 
health organisations as a cornerstone of global health and 
there have been strong, coordinated calls to integrate 
palliative care within health systems.2,3 Available evidence 
indicates that palliative care improves quality of life, 
symptom control, and patient and caregiver satisfaction, 
often at lower cost than the alternative.8,9 Despite these 
benefits, palliative care is frequently not mentioned in 
high-profile strategies in low-income, middle-income, 
and high-income coun 
tries,22–24 and provision is often 
insufficient to meet population needs. It has been 
estimated that just 14% of the people who need palliative 
care receive it, and that most of those are in high-income 
settings.4,25 More than half of low-income countries have 
no known hospice or palliative care activity.26 An in-depth 
analysis of palliative care develop 
ment in Africa found 
that only three of 48 African countries had composite 
scores of more than 50% when assessed with region-
specific macroindicators (which included the presence of 
pallia 
tive care policies, the availability of specialist services 
and medicines, and the provision of education).27 Given 
the projected increase in serious health-related suffering, 
integration of palliative care into health systems is an 
urgent priority requiring immediate attention, particularly 
in low-income countries, where needs are projected to 
increase most quickly. Failure to provide palliative care as 
a core component of universal health coverage will be 
catastrophic for these already vulnerable health systems.
Over the next four decades, the number of people dying 
with palliative care needs will increase rapidly among 
older people (≥70 years), with 22 million more people 
dying with serious health-related suffering in 2060 
compared with 2016. Malignant neoplasms will remain 
the largest contributor to serious health-related suffering 
in all world regions in 2060, affecting over 16 million 
people. The condition associated with the fastest rise in 
serious health-related suffering will be dementia, for 
which the need for palliative care is expected to increase 
4-fold from 2016 to 2060. Although national dementia 
strategies are increasingly common, these strategies 
frequently do not explicitly refer to palliative care 
provision.28 New models of care tailored to the end of life 
care needs of people with dementia are needed.29
Our study has similar limitations to all population 
approaches to palliative care needs assessment because 
it is based on mortality data. Accurate, cause-specific 
information on mortality is available for only a third of the 
world’s population; data for the remaining population 
depend on regional registries, epidemiological estimations, 
or cause of death models.30 Limitations in death registration 
data particularly affect lower income countries; uncertainty 
ranges for all-cause mortality vary from 1% in high-income 
countries to 20% for sub-Saharan Africa.19 Improvements 
in the recording of deaths worldwide would have num-
erous benefits, including more accurate projections of 
palliative care needs and the ability to explore variation at 
the level of individual countries.

We used the most up-to-date global mortality projections 
available to predict the need for palliative care until 2060. 
WHO mortality projections are modelled using disease-
specific mortality trends and are strongly based on the 
assumption that future mortality trends in lower-income 
countries  will reflect the social and economic development 
that has occurred in high-income countries.18 Unforeseen 
social, economic, and medical growth or crises could 
affect these projections. For example, the projected 
reduction in HIV mortality assumes the continued 
scale-up of antiretroviral therapy, whereas tuberculosis 
mortality projections do not incorporate potential 
accelerated improvement in response to the WHO End 
TB [tuberculosis] Strategy.18 Deaths from malnutrition can 
be affected by unforeseeable events, such as disasters and 
conflict. Geopolitical events have an enormous potential 
to affect health outcomes but are difficult to predict 
reliably. WHO mortality projections are not intended as 
precise forecasts of what will happen in the future, but as 
projections of future trends based on explicit assumptions. 
Previous WHO mortality projections from 2002 to 2030, 
modelled optimistic and pessimistic scenarios and found 
variations from –11% to 10% relative to the baseline 
scenario.19 Such scenarios are not available for the 
projections to 2060. Applying the previous variations to 
our projections gives an absolute global burden of serious 
health related suffering in 2060 of 43 million to 53 million 
people, a 66% to 105% relative increase compared with 
2016. The data presented in this Article should be 
compared with actual mortality data in future years and 
repeated when updated WHO mortality projections 
(including optimistic and pessimistic scenarios) are 
available.
All methods to estimate population palliative care need 
have a degree of error. We used the method of the Lancet 
Commission on Palliative Care and Pain Relief,2 which 
was developed to ensure relevance to LMICs. A strength 
is the use of multipliers to account for varying degrees 
of physical and psychological suffering in different 
conditions, which were developed following in-depth 
review of empirical data by an expert panel that included 
LMIC practitioners. These multipliers provide an 
indication, rather than a precise number, of the burden 
of serious health-related suffering and reflect, but might 
not be completely coincident with, palliative care need. 
The Lancet Commission method, like others, depends 
on single disease-associated mortality. Multimorbidity 
affects one in four people,31 and the prevalence is 
projected to double over the next 20 years with population 
ageing.32 Multimorbidity is associated with greater 
symptom burden;33 therefore, our projections are likely 
to underestimate the future burden of serious health-
related suffering. Methods to estimate population pallia-
tive care need that incorporate multimorbidity should be 
developed.
Decades of progress in reducing mortality from infec-
tious diseases have left a worrying legacy: a dramatic 
projected increase in the global burden of serious health-
related suffering at the end of life and need for palliative 
care. It is an ethical and economic imperative that 
governments plan for and provide services, education, 
and medicines to reduce suffering, alongside research to 
inform how such services are developed and imple-
mented in different health-care settings and populations.34 
Whereas in high-income countries palliative care pro-
vision frequently relies on specialists, models of integra-
tion of palliative care within primary care are more 
likely to ensure equitable access in LMICs. The Lancet 
Commission called for universal access to an essential 
package of palliative care and pain relief interventions, 
supported by policies to guide opioid provision, public 
awareness, pain management guidelines, and resource 
allocation.2 Provision of palliative care within universal 
health coverage has the potential to relieve suffering for 
millions of dying people, as well as strengthen health 
systems. Our projections provide the first quantification 
of the scale of suffering we will witness if nothing is 
done.
In conclusion, we have shown that the global burden 
of serious health-related suffering will almost double by 
2060, that a higher proportion of people in all world 
regions will experience suffering before they die, and 
that the regions most affected by this change will be 
those that currently have the least well developed 
palliative care provision. Immediate and concerted 
action by governments to fully integrate palliative care 
into universal health coverage is essential to mitigate 
against catastrophic weakening of health systems, and to 
alleviate the suffering of millions of patients and their 
families.
