Abstract
The delivery of genetic information has emerged as a valid thera-
peutic approach. Various reports have demonstrated that mRNA,
besides its remarkable potential as vaccine, can also promote
expression without inducing an adverse immune response against
the encoded protein. In the current study, we set out to explore
whether our technology based on chemically unmodified mRNA is
suitable for passive immunization. To this end, various antibodies
using different designs were expressed and characterized in vitro
and in vivo in the fields of viral infections, toxin exposure,
and cancer immunotherapies. Single injections of mRNA–lipid
nanoparticle (LNP) were sufficient to establish rapid, strong, and
long-lasting serum antibody titers in vivo, thereby enabling both
prophylactic and therapeutic protection against lethal rabies
infection or botulinum intoxication. Moreover, therapeutic mRNA-
mediated
antibody
expression
allowed
mice
to
survive
an
otherwise lethal tumor challenge. In conclusion, the present study
demonstrates the utility of formulated mRNA as a potent novel
technology for passive immunization.

Introduction
Today, vaccination is among the most effective medical treatments
for humans and animals, saving millions of lives by inducing immu-
nity against various pathogens. Protection afforded by currently
licensed vaccines is primarily based on induction of a humoral
immune response (Amanna & Slifka, 2011). It has been demon-
strated
that
neutralizing
antibodies
are
sufficient
to
prevent
dissemination of many diseases within populations (Plotkin, 2010).
Hence, passive immunization, by transferring either serum or puri-
fied antibodies, is a potent means to confer immediate protection
against various threats. Clinical benefit was demonstrated for inva-
sive bacterial infections (Casadevall & Scharff, 1994), for various
viral diseases (Janeway, 1945; Hammon et al, 1953), as well as for
anti-fungal therapy (Bugli et al, 2013), and polyclonal antibody
products were licensed for several viruses.
With the advent of antibiotics and vaccines, serum therapy was
almost abandoned but retained as a niche treatment for toxins,
venoms, and distinct viral infections. For instance, post-exposure
treatment of rabies as recommended by the World Health Organiza-
tion
consists
of
the
immediate
treatment
with
anti-rabies
immunoglobulins in combination with a rabies vaccine (Steele,
1988). As further example, botulism is treated with immune serum
(Pediatrics, 1997). Antibody therapies were revolutionized by the
development of the hybridoma technology for the production of
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (Kohler & Milstein, 1975). Since
then, more than thirty mAbs have been licensed, but only three of
these mAbs are for infectious disease indications, respiratory syncy-
tial virus, anthrax, and very recently rabies in India (Nagarajan
et al, 2014). Nevertheless, there is ample evidence that it is possible
to generate protective mAbs against many viruses and microorgan-
isms (Teitelbaum et al, 1998; Nosanchuk et al, 2003; Both et al,
2013).
Passive immunization declined as a treatment option for a vari-
ety of reasons. The primary reason has been the emergence of
antibiotics and vaccines. In addition, both serum- and mAb-based
therapeutics are costly to produce, store, and deliver as they
require a cold supply chain and are often administered intra-
venously (Chames et al, 2009; Keizer et al, 2010). Moreover,
passive immunization confers only a relatively short duration of
protection compared to vaccines. However, there is a renewed
interest in passive immunization. Emergence of microbial resis-
tance to antibiotics has increased the demand for alternative thera-
pies. Further, the discovery of broadly neutralizing antibodies may
offer new therapeutic options for influenza and HIV (Burton et al,
2012). Finally, in contrast to vaccines, antibodies enable a rapid

 onset of protective immunity. Particularly in a pandemic, passive
immunization can offer a critical advantage for blocking virus
spread.
As an alternative to the administration of recombinant antibod-
ies, DNA-based approaches have been extensively investigated.
Both plasmids as well as viral vectors (adenovirus, adeno-asso-
ciated virus) have been used for passive immunization. Using viral
vectors, sustained expression of low to mid microgram per milli-
liter levels was obtained in different models and conferred protec-
tion against influenza and RSV challenges (Lewis et al, 2002;
Skaricic et al, 2008; Balazs et al, 2011). In general, however, DNA-
based passive immunization suffers from the risk of genomic inte-
gration, potentially causing fatal mutations. Moreover, for safety
reasons,
transient
vectors
or
regulated
expression
would
be
preferred for clinical use (Deal & Balazs, 2015). In addition,
immunogenicity of virus particles has to be considered a main
obstacle for the use of this type of vectors for DNA-mediated
passive immunization.
In contrast, mRNA may offer an attractive alternative for passive
immunization. Following initial studies in the early 1990s demon-
strating that exogenous mRNA can direct protein expression in vivo,
mRNA has emerged as a promising drug platform technology in
recent years (Wolff et al, 1990; Jirikowski et al, 1992). Several stud-
ies have demonstrated the utility of mRNA as the basis of vaccines
in cancer immunotherapy as well as to promote prophylactic protec-
tion from infectious diseases (Hoerr et al, 2000; Fotin-Mleczek et al,
2011; Petsch et al, 2012; Kubler et al, 2015; Kranz et al, 2016).
Conclusive data have also been presented for mRNA as a platform
for protein (replacement) therapies (Kormann et al, 2011; Kariko
et al, 2012; Zangi et al, 2013; Thess et al, 2015; Balmayor et al,
2016). Physiological responses elicited in primates and domestic
pigs treated with an mRNA-encoded hormone have suggested the
feasibility of mRNA for large animal therapies (Thess et al, 2015).
Compared to DNA-based approaches, mRNA benefits from fewer
safety issues due to its non-integrative and transient nature, the
latter of which contributes to better and/or easier control of protein
expression, but may be disadvantageous, if prolonged bioavailabil-
ity is desired or even required. In contrast to the manufacturing of
many recombinant antibodies, mRNA has cost advantages, since
different sequences, and as
a
consequence proteins, can
be
produced by a generic process. Thus, mRNA-based antibodies for
passive immunization may be produced at competitive costs even in
cases where the product is only required in emergencies such as an
influenza pandemic.
In the present study, we set out to evaluate the use of mRNA
for passive immunization. To this end, we focused on two indi-
cations for which passive immunization is relevant today, rabies
and botulism, that can be considered prototypes for anti-pathogen
and anti-toxin therapies, respectively. To demonstrate the broad
applicability
of
mRNA
technology,
we
further
used
different
antibody formats. In both disease models, high levels of in vivo
serum expression were obtained that conferred full protection in
pre- and post-exposure scenarios. The flexibility of the mRNA
technology was further illustrated by complementary data from
additional indications, including the demonstration of therapeutic
efficacy
in a
tumor model.
Thus, our
work
establishes
the
foundation
for
development
of
novel
passive
immunization
therapies.
Results
In vitro expression and functionality of mRNA-encoded
antibodies
The intended goal of this study was to seek proof-of-principal data
demonstrating the feasibility of passive immunization by means of
prophylactic and therapeutic mRNA treatments encoding antibodies.
Efficacious treatment with therapeutic proteins depends on both
timely delivery and achieving protective levels. To demonstrate that
mRNA meets these requirements, two representative and clinically
relevant disease models were chosen. The first model, rabies, is an
invariably fatal disease that demands rapid administration of rabies
immunoglobulins in post-exposure scenarios to prevent encephalitis
and finally death of infected individuals. In 2003, a cocktail of mAbs
was developed which protected Syrian hamsters from lethal chal-
lenges with a highly virulent rabies virus strain in post-exposure
scenarios (Prosniak et al, 2003). For the present study, we selected
the monoclonal antibody S057, also well known as CR57, one
component of the published mAb cocktail, because it provides
broad neutralization of a variety of rabies virus strains via binding
to glycoprotein G. The second model, botulism, is a rare but often
fatal toxin-mediated illness that occurs following ingestion of food-
borne bacterial spores or via pre-formed toxin. This latter exposure
route is of concern as botulinum toxin is the most potent toxin
known, is quite stable, has a history of use as a bioweapon, and is
thus classified as a Category A bioterror agent. Due to the potency
and rapid onset of symptoms, exposure to botulinum toxin demands
immediate anti-toxin therapy which is currently an antiserum
(Pediatrics, 1997). To demonstrate the flexibility of mRNA-mediated
antibody expression, we selected a different antibody format, a
camelid heavy-chain-only VH domain (VHH)-based neutralizing
agent (VNA). In general, VNAs offer some advantages over classical
antibodies such as ease to engineer, improved heat and pH stability,
and better tissue penetration (Hamers-Casterman et al, 1993; van
der Linden et al, 1999; Tillib et al, 2013). The use of parenterally
administered VNAs that potently neutralize botulinum neurotoxin
serotype A (BoNT/A) has been previously reported (Mukherjee
et al, 2014). To further test the broad applicability of an mRNA-
based passive immunization platform, results from the two main
models were complemented by data with additional antibodies of
the IgG mAb or VNA type, including an anti-tumor application.
Since the major objective of passive immunization is protection
mediated by achieving high serum titers, we chose the liver as the
target organ for mRNA-mediated protein expression. To provide
prolonged mRNA stability and efficient protein translation, a previ-
ously approved format for liver expression harboring crucial regula-
tory mRNA elements was used (Fig 1A and D; Thess et al, 2015).
For VNA expression, we resorted to a recently developed design for
prolonged serum half-life (Mukherjee et al, 2014). Basically, VNA
sequences included two fused VHHs complemented by an albumin-
binding peptide to increase serum persistence and epitope tags for
protein detection (Fig 1A). In order to provide maximal flexibility
for the expression of IgG mAbs in the present study, we decided to
encode heavy and light chain on separate mRNA molecules
(Fig 1D). In B cells, solitary heavy chains are retained at the endo-
plasmic reticulum by the
chaperone
binding immunoglobulin
protein (BiP) (Hendershot et al, 1987). Heavy-chain retention for

 mRNA-mediated expression was confirmed in overexpressing non-B
cells, including a hepatic cell line that may mimic in vivo conditions
in the liver, our target organ for in vivo delivery (Appendix Fig S1).
In contrast, light chains were also secreted in the absence of heavy
chains. Since well-matched expression of heavy and light chain is
critical for obtaining a maximum of functional antibody, we titrated
the ratio between mRNAs encoding heavy and light chain in vitro.
High expression was obtained over a broad range of molar ratios
(heavy:light chain) (Appendix Fig S2). According to these results, a
ratio of approximately 1.5:1 was subsequently used through the
study.
Constructs for IgG mAbs against rabies glycoprotein G (S057),
influenza B hemagglutinin (CR8033; Dreyfus et al, 2012), HIV
gp120 (VRC01; Wu et al, 2010), and human CD20 (rituximab) all
revealed strong in vitro expression upon mRNA transfection of BHK
cells as measured by Western blot analysis and IgG-specific ELISA
(Fig 1E and F, and Appendix Fig S3A–F). Likewise, expression of
VNAs against botulinum neurotoxin serotype A (VNA-BoNTA) and
Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2) from E. coli (O157:H7) (VNA-Stx2) was readily
detected by Western blot and antigen-specific ELISA (Fig 1B and C,
and Appendix Fig S3G and H). In vitro antibody mRNA half-life in
primary mouse hepatocytes was approximately 15 h (Appendix Fig
S4A). Functionality of antibodies secreted into cell supernatants
after mRNA transfection was analyzed by various means. Specific
antigen binding of mAbs against rabies, influenza, and human CD20
was verified by staining of antigen-expressing target cells (Fig 2C–E
and Appendix Fig S5). Specific activity of mRNA-derived anti-HIV
mAb was demonstrated to be comparable to the respective recombi-
nant protein by measuring the inhibition of virus entry into reporter
cells (Fig 2F and Appendix Fig S6). VNA-BoNTA functionality was
confirmed by a SNAP25 cleavage inhibition assay demonstrating
that supernatants containing mRNA-encoded VNA-BoNTA had
neutralizing potency comparable to a recombinant VNA-BoNTA
protein standard (Fig 2A). Finally, supernatants containing mRNA-
encoded VNA-Stx2 proved capable to protect cell viability in the
presence of Shiga toxin with potency comparable to recombinant
VNA-Stx2 (Fig 2B). Taken together, mRNA proved to be an efficient
means to express diverse antibodies and antibody formats in vitro.
Expression of mRNA-encoded antibodies in vivo
Following the in vitro findings, it was explored whether protective
and long-lasting serum antibody titers can be obtained in mice.
Since affinity to its cognate antigen is crucial for the concentration
at which a specific antibody is protective, required concentrations
depend on the antibody of interest. Potential bottlenecks of reaching
protective serum levels may include the mRNA delivery to and/or
uptake into target cells, ribosome occupancy of mRNAs, and secre-
tion of assembled antibodies into the blood stream. While a proven
mRNA format was used to ensure efficient protein expression (see
above), hepatocytes were chosen as target cells to secure efficient
secretion. In order to maximize protein expression from liver, a
potent lipid nanoparticle (LNP) formulation was applied. It has been
specifically developed for delivery into the liver and has previously
been shown to be very effective in that respect, thus providing
robust protein expression (Pardi et al, 2015; Thess et al, 2015). In
line with current clinical antibody applications, this LNP formula-
tion is usually administered intravenously. Hence, this route was

 used throughout the present study, although for instance, the devel-
opment of a therapy for rabies will most likely require intramuscular
injection.
First, the dose–response relationship upon administration of
mRNA-LNP was determined for two humanized mAbs by analyzing
mouse sera with an IgG-specific ELISA. A single injection of increas-
ing mRNA-LNP doses induced rising serum levels of antibody
without reaching peak levels up to the highest doses tested in this
study (Fig 3A and Appendix Fig S7A). The highest levels observed
were in the low two-digit lg/ml range for both antibodies. For the
anti-rabies mAb, the dose–response relationship was confirmed by
analyzing virus neutralization titers which were comparable to
those from an earlier active immunization study and above the
protective level of 0.5 IU/ml as defined for humans at all mRNA
doses tested but the lowest (Fig 3B; Schnee et al, 2016). Hence, as
for in vitro expression, mRNA-mediated mAb expression in vivo
efficiently produced functional antibodies. While maximum expres-
sion levels observed for VNA-Stx2 were almost the same as for the
mAbs according to an antigen-specific ELISA of sera, VNA-BoNTA
gave rise to about 20-fold higher protein serum titers (Fig 3E and
Appendix Fig S7B–D). We hypothesize that this difference can be
attributed to the fact that we did not apply individually optimized
mRNAs but a fixed mRNA design. Interestingly, there appears to be
more than a strictly linear increase of serum titers with mRNA doses
for mAbs. However, this effect is not related to the necessity of
correctly assembling heavy and light chains and the separation of
both on distinct mRNA molecules, since the nonlinearity is equal or
even more pronounced for the single-chain VNA constructs.
Next, we addressed the kinetics of protein availability as a
further important parameter for any antibody therapy. In this
context, two fundamental questions are of importance: How
quickly are therapeutically effective serum titers reached and how
long do they persist? The ramp-up time of antibody serum titers is
determined by the kinetics of delivery and uptake of mRNA-LNP
into hepatocytes, protein translation, and secretion. Serum half-life
of antibodies is affected by both mRNA and protein half-life. In

BoNT/A toxin was incubated either with different doses of recombinant VNA, spiked into supernatant of mock-transfected BHK cells, or different dilutions of
supernatant of BHK cells transfected with mRNA encoding VNA-BoNTA before SNAP25 cleavage assay. In this assay, BoNT/A cleaves SNAP25 which can be inhibited
by VNA binding to the toxin. Samples from cleavage assay were loaded on denaturing SDS–PAGE and BoNT/A-mediated cleavage of endogenous SNAP25 was
analyzed.

 the case of mAbs, the latter is primarily determined by their Fc
region. In the absence of such a domain, the half-life of the VNAs
used here is substantially extended by the attached albumin-
binding peptide (Dennis et al, 2002) and have a half-life of about
1 day in mice (Mukherjee et al, 2014), significantly shorter than
the half-life typical for mAbs. For the anti-rabies mAb, serum titers
were readily detectable 2 h after treatment and peaked 6–12 h
post-injection (Fig 3C). During the following days, titers slowly
decreased with a half-life of approximately 1 week. While this
half-life remained unchanged in about 50% of the animals during
the observation period of 4 weeks, the remaining mice revealed an
accelerated drop of antibody serum titers from day 10 after treat-
ment on. This bipartite kinetics was confirmed in a second inde-
pendent study. While about half of the animals showed serum
half-lives of approximately 1 week for the 24-day observation
period, the others were characterized by substantially lower serum
titers at the end of the study (Fig 3D). In contrast, mice that
received mRNA coding for anti-influenza mAb all revealed the
same high serum levels after 24 days (Fig 3D). The estimated
serum half-life of this antibody was also about 1 week. For VNA-
BoNTA and VNA-Stx2, considerable titers were measured as early
as 2 h post-injection (Fig 3E and Appendix Fig S7B). Peak serum
levels were reached 6–24 h after administration. Thus, early kinet-
ics appeared similar for mAbs and VNAs. However, serum titers
dropped much faster for VNAs than for mAbs after day 2. For both
VNAs, serum half-lives were calculated to be in the range of
24–36 h which is in line with a previous report (Mukherjee et al,
2014). To arrive at an estimation for mRNA half-life in vivo in
order to assess its contribution to protein bioavailability, we
utilized mRNA-LNPs encoding the short-lived hormone erythropoi-
etin, suggesting a half-life of roughly 15 h (Appendix Fig S4B),
which is in good accordance with in vitro measurements.
To get insights into potential reasons for the accelerated serum
clearance of anti-rabies antibody in some animals, we investigated
the emergence of ADA (anti-drug antibody) responses. Obviously,
the individual clearance rates strongly correlated with the develop-
ment of a humoral response against the anti-rabies antibody
(Appendix Fig S8), thus perfectly explaining the divergent kinetics.

 In addition, mice were analyzed for general tolerability of mRNA-
LNP treatment. We did not observe any adverse events throughout
the present studies. There was a transient weak increase of some
cytokines in circulation (Appendix Table S1), which obviously did
not hamper high protein expression. Of note, equal or even higher
levels were considered unproblematic in a recent study on modified
mRNA encoding factor IX (Ramaswamy et al, 2017). Histopathology
of liver, the target organ of mRNA-LNPs, did not reveal any signs of
abnormality or inflammation (Appendix Fig S9). In summary, we
could demonstrate that mRNA-LNP enables a rapid and strong
expression of mRNA-encoded mAbs and VNAs. Moreover, sustained
protein availability was not compromised by in situ expression via
mRNA.
Prophylaxis and therapy with mRNA-encoded antibodies in mice
Based on the promising in vivo expression levels and kinetics, we
then asked whether mRNA-mediated antibody expression may
elicit measurable therapeutic effects. To this end, various biologi-
cal models were used for challenge studies. Initially, mice received
a single dose of mRNA-LNP encoding anti-rabies mAb and were
challenged

 (Fig 4B). Next, we switched to a clinically more relevant scenario,
post-exposure prophylaxis. After intramuscular infection, rabies
virus travels along the peripheral afferent nerves in order to reach
the
central
nervous
system
where
it
rapidly
causes
lethal
encephalitis. The time window for an efficacious treatment is
limited by the time it takes until the virus finally reaches the
brain. In mice, rabies infection is believed to proceed rapidly.
Thus, in order to be most probably within the yet undefined time
window, mRNA-LNP was administered 2 h after infection (Fig 4C).
All mice expressing the anti-rabies mAb survived, whereas the
majority of control animals which received anti-influenza mAb
mRNA succumbed (Fig 4D).
To clarify whether the partial survival of control animals repre-
sents a statistical outlier or may be indicative of some form of non-
specific immunostimulation, a second post-exposure challenge
experiment with additional control groups and larger group size
was conducted. Again, all mice receiving 40 lg of mRNA for anti-
rabies mAb survived (Fig 4E). A fourfold lower dose gave rise to
just partial protection. On the one hand, this means that efficacy of
this specific antibody is limited, at least requiring titers in the upper
single digit lg/ml range for full protection. On the other hand, this
clearly indicates that the VNT guidelines for humans cannot be
simply transferred to mice, since 10 lg of mRNA gave VNTs well
above the 0.5 IU/ml threshold (Fig 3B). While all animals receiving
just buffer succumbed to rabies infection, 1 out of 12 mice treated
with 40 lg of mRNA for the irrelevant anti-influenza mAb survived,
which is well below the survival rate in the first experiment.
However, animals that received a fourfold lower dose of influenza
mRNA again showed a survival rate of about 40%. In case of a non-
specific protection by mRNA-LNP, survival rates would be expected
to be the opposite. Hence, survival rates of 0–40% rather appear to
represent the natural variation of spontaneous survival under the
challenge conditions used here.
To further challenge the kinetics of protection by mRNA-encoded
antibodies, we next switched to a model in which immediate action
is crucial for survival, BoNT/A intoxication. BoNT/A challenge
experiments are well established (Mukherjee et al, 2012) and repre-
sent an excellent system for analysis, since the time course of intoxi-
cation is well defined and unprotected mice succumb rapidly. Mice
were challenged with 4 × LD50 of BoNT/A intravenously and
treated with mRNA-LNP either encoding VNA-BoNTA or VNA-Stx2
or with recombinant VNA-BoNTA at 2, 4 or 6 h post-intoxication
(Fig 4F and Appendix Fig S10).
Full survival with no clinical signs was observed when animals
were treated at 2 or 4 h after intoxication with either VNA-BoNTA
mRNA or recombinant VNA-BoNTA (Appendix Fig S10A and B),
while all control mice died. Mice treated 6 h post-intoxication with
VNA-BoNTA mRNA or recombinant VNA-BoNTA also survived
(Fig 4G); however, these mice displayed moderate clinical signs.
The presence of clinical signs indicates that 6 h is near the end of
the treatment window, since antitoxins cannot neutralize toxin once
it has entered and paralyzed motor neurons. Again, all mice which
received the negative control, mRNA-LNP encoding VNA-Stx2,
succumbed within 36 h. Taken together, mRNA was at no disadvan-
tage compared to recombinant protein in a post-intoxication setting,
thereby highlighting the highly favorable kinetics of mRNA-based
antibody expression onset which opens up a broad array of new
therapeutic approaches.
We finally set out to evaluate whether mRNA-mediated antibody
expression may be effective in the field of cancer immunotherapy
where mAbs are widely used in medical practice. For instance, the
combination of chemotherapy and intravenous administration of
rituximab
is
the
gold
standard
for
treating
non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma. Hence, we inoculated mice intravenously with luciferase
expressing Raji lymphoma cells and started treatment with mRNA-
LNP encoding rituximab 4 days later (Fig 5A). Control animals all
revealed strong tumor cell proliferation and had to be euthanized
17 days after inoculation due to severe symptoms (Fig 5B–D). By
contrast, repeated intravenous administration of either 50 or 10 lg
of mRNA-LNP for rituximab strongly decelerated or even abolished
tumor cell growth. Until the end of the study 28 days after tumor
cell inoculation, all animals in the high-dose group and all but two
mice in the low-dose group survived. In a second study, rituximab-
encoding mRNA-LNPs were compared to recombinant protein
(Fig 5E and F). Moreover, mRNA-LNPs coding for an irrelevant anti-
body were used as further control. As in the previous study,
untreated control mice revealed fast tumor progression leading to
euthanization after about 17 days. Animals treated with irrelevant
antibody mRNA appeared to show delayed tumor growth kinetics.
This effect may be attributable to the aforementioned weak cytokine
response and/or repeated injections/handling per se. Nevertheless,
even compared to this control group, treatment with recombinant
antibody at a dose which has been widely used in mouse studies on
rituximab clearly suppressed tumor growth. The anti-tumor effect of
50 lg of mRNA-LNP for rituximab was even more pronounced and
as strong as in the first study. In summary, mRNA-encoded antibod-
ies appear to represent a viable therapeutic option for various
biological threats, including (viral) infections, intoxication, and
cancer.
Discussion
For any viable platform for prophylactic and therapeutic antibodies,
three parameters are of particular relevance: antibody serum titers
sufficient to fully protect against biological threats, a fast ramp-up of
serum titers upon treatment, and an acceptable half-life of serum
titers, mainly for the sake of convenience in terms of less frequent
treatments. In the present work, we set out to evaluate whether
mRNA
meets
these
requirements
and
therefore
represents
a
competitive antibody platform. Using diverse disease models,
mRNA-mediated antibody expression proved capable of providing
therapeutic benefit. It conferred full protection against intoxication
and virus challenge and could eradicate neoplastic cells in a murine
tumor model. While the present manuscript was under review, the
feasibility of using mRNA for passive vaccination was indepen-
dently confirmed in an HIV model (Pardi et al, 2017).
An earlier study on a different secreted protein, erythropoietin,
revealed that findings in a murine model translated to larger animals
such as domestic pigs as well as to primates (Thess et al, 2015).
Thus, the present data suggest that mRNA-encoded antibodies offer
a therapeutic option in humans as well. However, therapeutic doses
of today’s recombinant antibodies are often quite high. Are even
those indications accessible to mRNA approaches? Several consider-
ations argue in favor of such a conclusion. Firstly, it is possible that
in situ antibody expression may reduce the amount of protein

 required for a therapeutic effect. Secondly, up to the doses tested so
far, we found that the dose–response curve for mRNA-mediated
antibody expression did not reveal any saturation nor did we
observe any dose-limiting toxicity. Thus, a further dose escalation
appears to be feasible if even higher serum antibody levels are
desirable. Thirdly, in light of previous findings, it is likely that
target-specific mRNA optimizations and further improvements to
the formulation can substantially increase efficacy (Thess et al,
2015). This assumption is corroborated by the differences in peak
expression levels between anti-rabies mAb and BoNTA VNA in the
present study (Fig 3A and E). Obviously, this difference cannot be
simply attributed to the distinct antibody designs, since Stx2 VNA
expression produced antibody titers at the same level as the anti-
rabies mAb. Thus, the use of a previously approved design for the
various constructs instead of having individually optimized mRNA
formats is most likely responsible for the different outcomes.
Fourthly, the effective dose of an antibody is strongly dependent on
its characteristics, that is, potential limitations may be overcome
with the right protein (De Benedictis et al, 2016). Overall, with
regard to antibody titers, mRNA appears to be applicable to a broad
range of indications. However, this will certainly have to be con-
firmed on a case-by-case basis. Moreover, indications such as rabies
will probably require intramuscular administration in the light of
approved therapies. It has still to be demonstrated that this route
enables protective expression levels, particularly since it may reduce
the number of target cells reached by the mRNA. Of note, mRNA
appears to be at no (substantial) disadvantage compared to DNA
with respect to serum levels.
Any passive vaccination platform needs to provide effective anti-
body levels soon after drug administration. We now demonstrate
herein that our mRNA technology enables the in vivo synthesis of
antibodies displaying favorable pharmacokinetics with substantial
antibody titers already detectable as early as 2 h after treatment. To
address whether this temporal profile translates into a fast onset of
protection, infection with rabies virus is a suitable in vivo model.
According to in vitro data, the virus enters cells within 20 min after
inoculation (Dietzschold et al, 1985). Nevertheless, antibodies could
inhibit infection up to 4 h post-exposure. In vivo, many anti-rabies

 antibodies become ineffective after the virus has entered the CNS.
Whether this applies to the S057 mAb used here is unknown.
Furthermore, the time window for efficacious antibody intervention
has not been defined for mice for which a very fast progress of the
disease has been reported. Hence, we chose a 2 h post-exposure
scenario for the mRNA and could demonstrate full protection. To
further challenge the kinetics of protection, we drew on an intoxica-
tion model that requires even faster responses. Protection against
death was achieved even with a 6 h post-exposure treatment. Thus,
although mRNA clearly cannot act as fast as an infused recombinant
antibody, our data suggest that mRNA may meet the requirements
of at least most indications, if not all.
For the present study, LNP-formulated mRNA was used to
express humanized IgG mAbs in mice. Serum half-life for two dif-
ferent proteins turned out to be in the range of 1 week. This
temporal profile is primarily determined by the half-life of the anti-
body, since longevity of IgG proteins substantially exceeds that of
mRNA. In general, in case of long-lived proteins, the use of an
mRNA expression platform has no apparent impact on the dura-
tion of the therapeutic effect, but mRNA half-life does contribute
to peak level expression. By contrast, short-lived proteins can
significantly profit by being expressed from mRNA (Kariko et al,
2012; Thess et al, 2015). Accordingly, VNAs with an estimated
serum half-life of 1–2 days (with albumin-binding) should benefit
from being encoded by mRNA (Mukherjee et al, 2014). Indeed,
estimated half-lives of VNA serum titers at one to 3 days after
treatment were on average 1.5-fold higher than from day 3 on,
even without a target-specific mRNA optimization. While during
the first phase mRNA and protein half-lives both contribute to the
kinetics of serum titers, the kinetics during the second phase is
almost exclusively determined by the protein’s properties. In
contrast, DNA has the potential to elicit longer bioavailability
which may be of advantage in pandemic scenarios, but may be
considered disadvantageous, if persistent antibody expression is
neither required nor desired.
Any protein therapy has the inherent risk of inducing an anti-
drug antibody (ADA) response which may limit drug efficacy,
particularly over time. The probability of an ADA response is
especially high for proteins that are foreign to the body. The risk
may be further increased, if the protein is encoded by a nucleic
acid which may trigger an innate immune response via diverse
cellular sensors. Hence, to test for induction of ADA using an
mRNA-mediated antibody therapy, we chose humanized mAbs for
expression in mice. The pharmacokinetics data for an anti-rabies
antibody indeed appeared to suggest an induction of an ADA
response as about half of the animals revealed accelerated serum
clearance after about 2 weeks (Fig 3C and D). This drop of serum
titers correlated with elevated ADA levels 4 weeks after treatment
(Appendix Fig S8). In contrast, serum clearance maintained its
slow initial rate during the whole observation period for a human-
ized anti-HA antibody (Fig 3D). This clearly suggests that our
chemically unmodified mRNA does not stimulate a suppressive
immune response per se which is in line with a previous report
on erythropoietin (Thess et al, 2015). Instead, the ADA response
is triggered by the mismatch between antibody sequence and
species and strongly dependent on the protein’s identity. Thus,
mRNA appears to represent an appropriate platform for antibody
expression. As expected, half-lives of serum titers were much
shorter for VNAs compared to mAbs. However, better protein
stabilization approaches and further improved mRNA half-life by
specific mRNA optimization will certainly reduce the gap between
VNAs and mAbs for therapies in which persistence in serum is
preferred.
Here, we present evidence that mRNA can act as an appropriate
platform for passive immunization. In addition, it has been previ-
ously demonstrated that mRNA represents a potent vaccine technol-
ogy (Kreiter et al, 2010; Fotin-Mleczek et al, 2011). In consequence,
mRNA may be the ideal platform for applications where combina-
tion of both passive and active immunization is of advantage or
even required such as for rabies post-exposure prophylaxis. Ideally,
passive and active immunization will use the same route of admin-
istration for the sake of convenience. It has been demonstrated that
mRNA active vaccination can use both the intramuscular as well as
the intravenous route (Petsch et al, 2012; Kranz et al, 2016). More-
over, expression of therapeutic proteins can also be achieved by
intramuscular administration (Schlake et al, 2012). Therefore, a
merging of administration routes for passive and active immuniza-
tion appears to be possible, if necessary or desirable. Taken
together, the findings of the present study suggest mRNA to be a
promising novel platform for antibody therapies.
Materials and Methods
Protein design
Antibody sequences were designed as follows. The sequences of
anti-rabies antibody SO57 heavy (GenBank: AAO17821.1) and light
chain (GenBank: AAO17824.1) have been published previously
(Prosniak et al, 2003). The sequences of the variable regions of
CR8033 heavy (PDB: 4FQL_H) and light chain (PDB: 4FQL_L) were
published by Dreyfus et al (2012). The sequences for variable
regions of VRC01 have been described by Wu et al (2010). The
sequence of rituximab variable regions has been published previ-
ously (Nebija et al, 2011). For the heavy chains of CR8033 and
VRC01, the sequence of the IgG constant region of SO57 was used.
For rituximab, the immunoglobulin heavy chain was derived from
AFR78282.1. For CR8033, VRC01, and rituximab, the sequence of
an immunoglobulin kappa light-chain constant region was used
(GenBank: AGH70219.1). VNA sequences for both VNA-BoNTA and
VNA-Stx2 consist of two VHHs each, and their sequences have been
published. VNA-BoNTA is reported in Mukherjee et al (2014). VNA-
Stx2 has the same sequence as VNA-BoNTA except that the two
BoNT/A-neutralizing VHHs were replaced by two Stx2-neutralizing
VHHs, Stx-A5, and Stx2-G1, which were reported in Tremblay et al
(2013).

RNA formulation
Lipid nanoparticle formulation was conducted at Acuitas Therapeu-
tics (Vancouver, Canada) and has been described previously (Thess
et al, 2015). RNAs encoding mAbs were mixed at a molar ratio of
approximately 1.5 (heavy- over light-chain-encoding mRNA) before
LNP
formulation.
For
injections,
mRNA-LNP
was
diluted
in
phosphate-buffered saline pH 7.4.
Cell transfections
For in vitro transfection of cells, RNAs were complexed with
Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany; at
1.5 ll/lg of mRNA for BHK or at 1 ll/lg for HepG2) and trans-
fected into cells according to manufacturer’s instructions. To
analyze the expression of different mAbs and VNAs, 400,000 BHK
cells were seeded 1 day before transfection in six-well plates. Cells
were transfected with 5 lg of antibody or VNA-encoding RNAs.
Approximately 2 h after transfection, transfection mix was replaced
by 1.5 ml of serum-free freestyle 293 medium (Thermo Scientific
Cat. 12338018). Cells were grown for approximately 48 h, and
supernatants were harvested, spun down to remove cell debris, and
used for analyses. For preparation of lysates, cells were incubated
for 5 min with Laemmli buffer and subsequently collected. To
analyze different heavy-to-light-chain ratios, 10,000 BHK cells were
seeded 1 day before transfection in 96-well plates. Cells were trans-
fected with 100 ng of antibody-encoding RNAs. Approximately 2 h
after transfection, transfection mixes were replaced by 200 ll free-
style 293 medium (Thermo Scientific Cat. 12338018). Cells were
grown for approximately 48 h, and supernatants were harvested
and used for analyses. Mouse primary hepatocytes (Thermo Fisher,
Cat. MSCP10) were thawed according to manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Cells were plated on collagen-coated 24 well plates (Thermo
Fisher, Cat. A1142802) at a density of 200,000 cells per well in a
volume of 0.5 ml in plating medium (Williams medium E; Thermo
Fisher Cat. 22551022 supplemented with Primary Hepatocyte Thaw-
ing and Plating Supplements; Thermo Fisher, Cat. CM3000). After
5 h, cells were washed twice in serum-free maintenance medium
(Williams medium E; Thermo Fisher Cat. 22551022 supplemented
with Primary Hepatocyte Maintenance Supplements; Thermo Fisher,
Cat. CM4000). Transfection of cells with 0.5 lg mRNA-LNP encod-
ing anti-rabies mAb, diluted in 100 ll Opti-MEM, was done in main-
tenance medium overnight. Supernatants were collected every day,
and medium was exchanged. Antibody titers were measured by IgG-
specific ELISA as described above.

or supernatants were loaded. For all Western blots depicted in this

skimmed milk in TBST for 1 h or in case of HepG2 supernatants
overnight. Immediately before band detection, all membranes were
washed three times each for 10 min in TBST and stored in TBS lack-
ing Tween-20 until analysis. For detection of VNAs, the following
antibodies
were
used:

(Abcam, Cat. ab6276) and rabbit anti-E-tag antibody 1:10,000
(Bethyl, A190-133A) as primary antibodies and goat anti-mouse IgG
(H + L) IRDye� 680RD 1:10,000 (Li-COR, Cat. 926-32210) and goat
anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) IRDye� 800CW 1:15,000 (Li-COR, Cat. 926-
32211) were used as secondary antibodies. Incubation times were
the same as described above. Protein detection and image process-
ing were carried out in an Odyssey� CLx Imaging system and
LI-COR’s Image Studio version 5.2.5 according to manufacturer’s
recommendations.
ELISA
Goat anti-human IgG (1 mg/ml; SouthernBiotech; Cat. 2044-01) was
diluted 1:1,000 in coating buffer (15 mM Na2CO3, 15 mM NaHCO3
and 0.02% NaN3, pH 9.6) and used to coat Nunc MaxiSorp� flat-
bottom 96-well plates (Thermo Fischer) with 100 ll for 4 h at 37°C.
After coating, wells were washed three times (PBS pH 7.4 and
0.05% Tween-20) and blocked overnight in 200 ll blocking buffer
(PBS, 0.05% Tween-20 and 1% BSA) at 4°C. Human IgG1 control
antibody (Erbitux at 5 mg/ml; Merck, PZN 0493528) was diluted in
blocking buffer to 100 ng/ml. Starting with this solution, a serial
dilution was prepared for generating a standard curve. Samples
were diluted appropriately in blocking buffer (PBS, 0.05% Tween-
20, and 1% BSA) to allow for quantification. All further incubations
were carried out at room temperature. Diluted supernatants or sera
were added to the coated wells and incubated for 2 h. Solution was
discarded and wells were washed three times. Detection antibody
(goat anti-human IgG Biotin, Dianova; Cat. 109065088) was diluted
1:20,000 in blocking buffer, 100 ll was added to wells and incu-
bated for 60–90 min. Solution was discarded and wells were washed
three times. HRP–streptavidin (BD Pharmingen
TM, Cat. 554066) was
diluted 1:1,000 in blocking buffer, 100 ll was added to wells and
incubated for 30 min. HRP solution was discarded and wells were
washed four times. 100 ll of Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB, Thermo
Scientific, Cat. 34028) substrate was added and reaction was
stopped by using 100 ll of 20% sulfuric acid. MfEPO levels were
quantified with Human Erythropoietin Quantikine IVD ELISA Kit

 (R&D Systems, Cat. DEP00) according to manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. For the detection of mouse-specific anti-SO57 antibodies, an
ELISA was carried out as described above with the following anti-
bodies: BHK cells were transfected with mRNA encoding SO57 as
described above. After 72 h, supernatants were collected and S057
antibody was purified using protein A beads from Pierce
TM (Thermo
Scientific Cat. 44667) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Wells were then coated with 100 ll at 1 lg/ml. Mouse anti-human
IgG (H + L) cross-adsorbed secondary antibody (Thermo Scientific
Cat. 31135) was used as internal standard. Goat anti-mouse IgG
(H + L) secondary antibody, biotin (Thermo Scientific Cat. 31800),
was used at 1:50,000 for detection. Absorbance at 450 nm was
measured in a plate reader (Hidex Chameleon Model: 425-156 or
BertholdTech TriStar2 Model: LB 942). The measurement of VNA
titers in supernatants or sera has been described previously
(Mukherjee et al, 2014; Sheoran et al, 2015).
VNA functional testing
VNA-mRNAs were transfected into BHK cells as described above,
and supernatants, collected at 48 (VNA-Stx2) or 72 h (VNA-
BoNTA), were tested for their ability to inhibit the effects of the
respective toxins in cell-based assays. BoNT/A neutralization by
culture supernatants was assessed as reported in Mukherjee et al
(2012). Briefly, serial dilutions of the BHK supernatants were incu-
bated with primary neurons, then treated with BoNT/A (20 pM)
overnight, and finally, intoxication was assessed by analysis of
cleavage of endogenous SNAP-25 by Western blotting. Stx2 neutral-
ization was performed as reported in Tremblay et al (2013). Briefly,
serial dilutions of the BHK supernatants were incubated with Vero
cells, then treated with Stx2 (35 pM) for 2 days, and finally, cell
death was quantified by protein staining. Recombinant VNA
proteins were used as positive controls in both assays.
FACS analysis
For the generation of antigen-expressing target cells, 400,000 HeLa
cells were seeded in six-well plates 24 h before transfection. Cells
were transfected with 1 lg of mRNAs encoding either rabies virus
glycoprotein or influenza B hemagglutinin or mock-transfected with
Lipofectamine 2000 only. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed
once in PBS, detach buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and
1 mM EDTA) was added, and cells were incubated at 37°C for
15 min. Cells were collected and seeded in 96-well plates. All subse-
quent incubation steps were carried out for 30 min at 4°C in the
dark. All washing steps were done with PBS, 0.5% BSA, separated
by centrifugation at 500 rcf each time for 3 min. For discrimination
of live and dead cells, LIVE/DEAD
TM Fixable Dead Cell Stain Kits
(Thermo Scientific, Cat. L34957) was applied first. Supernatants
were then discarded, and cells were washed two times. For binding
of antibodies to antigen-expressing cells, diluted supernatants
containing antibodies (in PBS, 0.5% BSA) were added. Afterward,
cells were washed two times, followed by addition of 1:750 diluted
secondary antibody (goat anti-human IgG biotinylated, Dianova,
Cat. 109065088). After two washing steps, cells were incubated with
a 1:500 diluted streptavidin–R-Phycoerythrin conjugate solution
(Thermo Scientific Cat. S866). If necessary, cells were fixed in 1%
formaldehyde for 30 min at 4°C in the dark. For FACS analysis, cells
were re-suspended in PFEA (PBS, 2% FCS, 2 mM EDTA and 0.01%
sodium azide). For the detection of functional rituximab in cell
supernatants, Raji cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of
200,000 cells per well. For anti-CD20 staining, supernatants of
HEK293T cells, transfected with rituximab as described above, were
added. Staining was conducted according to the protocol given
above. For quantification of rituximab in supernatants, recombinant
rituximab (MabThera, Roche, PZN-8709896) served as a control.
FACS analysis was carried out using a BD FACSCANTO II system
(BD Biosciences).
Cytokine analysis
Cytokines were quantified using BD Cytometric Bead Array (CBA)
Mouse/Rat Soluble Protein Master Buffer Kit (BD, Cat. 558266)
according to manufacturer’s instructions. FACS analysis was carried
out using a BD FACSCANTO II system (BD Biosciences).

BALB/c mice (Janvier Labs, Le Genest-Saint-Isle, France) were
injected
intravenously
with
mRNA-LNP.
24 h
post-injection,
animals were sacrificed and isolated livers were fixed in neutral
buffered formalin. Tissue samples were embedded in paraffin and
cut on a rotation microtome; 5-lm thin slices were put onto
microscopic slides and dried overnight. After hematoxylin and eosin
(H+E) staining, liver sections were inspected for histological
abnormalities.
Animal experiments
Dose-finding studies for anti-influenza B and anti-rabies mAbs,
kinetics of anti-rabies mAb expression as well as rabies challenge
experiments were carried out at Viroclinics Biosciences B.V. (Rotter-
dam and Schaijk, Netherlands) in accordance with national laws.
Ethical approvals in the Netherlands for the studies are registered as
AVD905002015124-WP03, WP04 and WP05, respectively. Six- to
eight-week-old, specific-pathogen-free, outbred female NIH Swiss
albino mice (Harlan, The Netherlands) were used. For dose finding
and expression kinetics studies, mice received a single intravenous
injection of LNP-formulated mRNA. To analyze the kinetics of anti-
body expression, a total of five cohorts were used due to limitations
as to the frequency and total volume of blood drawings. Sample size
was estimated using previous unpublished data in order to enable
detection of twofold differences in expression and analysis of the
kinetics. All animals received a single dose of 40 lg LNP-formulated
mRNA at the beginning of the study. All samplings were carried out
by retro-orbital bleeding. To analyze baseline human IgG titers,
naive mice were sampled either two (dose finding) or five (kinetics)
days before treatment with mRNA-LNP. In all experiments, baseline
human IgG titers were below the detection limit. All animal experi-
ments involving mRNA-encoded VNAs were conducted at the

 LNP-formulated mRNA into the tail vein. Blood was sampled by
retro-orbital bleeding at defined times, and VNA accumulation in
sera was measured as described previously (Tremblay et al, 2013;
Mukherjee et al, 2014). Sample size was estimated using previous
unpublished data in order to enable analysis of the kinetics. For
analysis of MfEPO expression kinetics, in vivo experiments were
carried out with ethical approvals registered as CUR7-13. Briefly,
6- to 10-week-old female BALB/c mice were intravenously (tail
vein) injected with 30 lg of mRNA-LNP encoding MfEPO with one
cohort for each time point. Samplings were done by retro-orbital
bleeding. In all studies, animals were housed under standard condi-
tions with a standard commercial rodent diet and tap water
provided to the animals ad libitum.
Challenge experiments
Six- to eight-week-old female NIH Swiss albino mice were housed in
custom-made glovebox isolators under standard conditions and
were challenged with a 5 × LD50 dose of intramuscularly applied
Pasteur strain rabies virus. Sample size was estimated based on
prior virus stock titration and considered the likelihood of sponta-
neous survivors. For both prophylactic and therapeutic treatment, a
single intravenous injection of LNP-formulated mRNA (or PBS when
indicated) was administered either 24 h before or 2 h after chal-
lenge. Mice were inspected daily for clinical symptoms. Mice which
suffered from severe progression to rabies encephalitis were eutha-
nized at the humane endpoint (a score of 3 or a body weight loss of
more than 5% on two following days). The scoring of clinical symp-
toms involved: score of 0 (no symptoms), score of 1 (early sign of
encephalitis), score of 2 (progression to rabies encephalitis) and
score of 3 (rabies encephalitis = humane endpoint). Scoring was
done by two individual operators without any information on treat-
ment.

ized based on body weight. Therapeutic treatments following lethal
challenges involved intravenous injections of 40 lg LNP-formulated
mRNA or 2 lg of recombinant VNA-BoNTA. Sample size was esti-
mated based on previous unpublished data on toxin challenge and
mRNA-encoded antibody expression. Tumor challenge experiments

treated with intravenous injections of either ten or 50 lg mRNA-
LNP encoding rituximab. A total of five injections were adminis-
tered until day 18 with two injections per week. In a follow-up
study, mice received a total of six injections until day 21 either with
50 lg mRNA-LNP encoding rituximab or anti-influenza mAb or
200 lg recombinant rituximab with two injections per week. In both
studies, animals were randomized using matched pair distribution
method, based on body weight. Animals were checked daily for
clinical signs and whole-body luminescence imaging was carried
out at indicated times using a PerkinElmer IVIS� XR imaging
system. Animals were euthanized upon excessive (> 15%) body
weight loss and/or hindlimb paralysis (humane endpoint). In all
challenge studies, a standard commercial rodent diet and tap water
were provided to the animals ad libitum.
Rabies VNT analyses
Mouse sera were analyzed for VNTs by a fluorescence antibody
neutralization assay (FAVN assay) by EuroVir GmbH in Lucken-
walde, Germany.

were subjected to a Magi R5-Tropic Antiviral Assay performed at
Southern Research (Maryland, USA). The procedure of the assay

The paper explained
Problem
While antibodies offer a potent and widely used means in cancer
treatment, there are only three approved monoclonal antibodies
against infectious diseases today, although protective antibodies have
been described for a variety of pathogens. Thus far, antibodies are at
a disadvantage compared to antibiotics and vaccines, predominantly
for economic reasons. Hence, there is a strong demand for cost-effec-
tive alternatives to the administration of recombinant proteins. DNA-
based antibody expression proved to reach protective serum titers in
various preclinical models. However, permanent or at least long-
lasting expression is often undesired for passive immunization, thus
requiring sophisticated approaches for the clinic. By contrast, tran-
sience is inherent to another nucleic acid, mRNA. Moreover, a number
of recent intriguing studies principally suggested mRNA as a means
for molecular therapies requiring the delivery of functional proteins.
Results
In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed efficient expression of func-
tional antibodies from exogenous mRNA. Flexibility of the technology
was demonstrated by the expression of different antibodies and anti-
body formats such as classical IgG-based monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs) or heavy-chain-only neutralizing agents (VNAs). In vivo, LNP–
mRNA-mediated antibody expression protected mice against diverse
biological threats such as virus, toxin, and neoplastic cell growth.
Protection was obtained in pre- and post-exposure treatment scenar-
ios. mRNA revealed a favorable expression kinetics giving rise to
immediately elevated antibody serum titers. As a consequence, the
efficacy of mRNA was comparable to recombinant antibody therapy
in a particularly challenging post-exposure scenario for intoxication.
Impact
Today, passive immunization only fills a niche in preventing or
fighting infectious diseases, mainly due to non-competitive costs
compared to antibiotics and vaccines. However, there is renewed
interest in passive immunization, for instance since the emergence of
microbial resistance to antibiotics increased the demand for alterna-
tive therapies. The present study reveals that mRNA-mediated anti-
body expression can confer protection against diverse biological
threats. We suggest formulated mRNA as a novel armamentarium for
the development of competitive passive immunization therapies.
