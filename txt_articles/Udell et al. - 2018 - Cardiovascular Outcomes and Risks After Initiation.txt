BACKGROUND: Clinical trials have shown cardiovascular benefits and 
potential risks from sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). Trials 
may have limited ability to address individual end points or safety concerns.
METHODS: We performed a population-based cohort study among patients 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus with established cardiovascular disease newly 
initiated on antihyperglycemic agents within the US Department of Defense 
Military Health System between April 1, 2013, and December 31, 2016. 
Incidence rates, hazard ratios (HRs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 
time to first composite end point of all-cause mortality and hospitalization for 
heart failure event, major adverse cardiovascular events (defined as all-cause 
mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke), and individual 
end points were evaluated using conditional Cox models comparing new 
SGLT2i users with other antihyperglycemic agents. The exploratory safety end 
point was below-knee lower extremity amputation. Intent-to-treat and on-
treatment analyses were performed.
RESULTS: After propensity matching, 25 258 patients were followed for 
a median of 1.6 years. Compared with non-SGLT2i, initiation of SGLT2i 
was associated with a lower rate of all-cause mortality and hospitalization 
for heart failure (1.73 versus 3.01 events per 100 person-years; HR, 0.57; 
95% CI, 0.50–0.65) and major adverse cardiovascular events (2.31 versus 
3.45 events per 100 person-years; HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.60–0.75). SGLT2i 
initiation was also associated with an ≈2-fold higher risk of below-knee 
lower extremity amputation (0.17 versus 0.09 events per 100 person-
years; HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.12–3.51). Because of the disproportionate 
canagliflozin exposure in the database, the majority of amputations were 
observed on canagliflozin. Results were consistent in the on-treatment 
analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: In this high-risk cohort, initiation of SGLT2i was associated 
with lower risk of all-cause mortality, hospitalization for heart failure, and 
major adverse cardiovascular events and higher risk of below-knee lower 
extremity amputation. Findings underscore the potential benefit and risks to 
be aware of when initiating SGLT2i. It remains unclear whether the below-
knee lower extremity amputation risk extends across the class of medication, 
because the study was not powered to make comparisons among individual 
treatments.

Cardiovascular Outcomes and Risk With Sodium Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors in EASEL
ORIGINAL RESEARCH

S
odium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) 
are a new class of antihyperglycemic agents (AHAs) 
that function to concomitantly inhibit the reabsorp-
tion of glucose and sodium in the renal proximal convo-
luting tubule.1 These drugs result in glycosuria and na-
triuresis, which translates into an ≈0.7 to 1% reduction 
in circulating glycohemoglobin A1c, ≈5/2 mm 
Hg blood 
pressure reduction, ≈2 to 3 kg loss in body weight, ≈30 
to 40% reduction in albuminuria via a reduction in in-
traglomerular pressure, and other favorable metabolic 
effects.2 A number of cardiovascular (CV) outcome tri-
als in patients with and without type 2 diabetes melli-
tus (T2DM) are ongoing to study the CV benefits and 
safety of these drugs compared with standard care.3–5 
Two trials in patients with T2DM and high CV risk have 
recently reported reductions in major adverse cardiovas-
cular events (MACE), specifically the composite of CV 
mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), and nonfa-
tal stroke, and particular benefit in reducing hospitaliza-
tion for heart failure (HHF).6–8 It has been hypothesized 
that the benefit for HHF, which has been observed out 
of proportion to that of MACE, may in part be a result 
of plasma volume contraction and weight loss.9,10 Simi-
larly, a lower risk of all-cause mortality (ACM) and HHF 
has been reported with the use of these medications in 
routine clinical practice.11 However, the use of an SGLT2i 
may result in potential harm, with reports of increased 
risk for genitourinary tract infections, diabetic ketoaci-
dosis, acute kidney injury, fractures, and atraumatic be-
low-knee lower extremity amputation (BKA).8,9,12–17 The 
latter complication is a less common but serious clini-
cal manifestation of progressive disease with substantial 
associated morbidity, yet reliable data on this outcome 
are sparse.18 Given that trials may enroll a select patient 
population and be of limited size and duration to address 
individual efficacy end points and safety concerns,19 EA-
SEL (Evidence for Cardiovascular Outcomes With Sodium 
Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitors in the Real World), a 
population-based cohort study, was undertaken to eval-
uate whether new initiation of an SGLT2i is associated 
with a lower risk of CV events and increased risk of BKA 
compared with other AHAs in patients with T2DM and 
established CV disease (CVD).
METHODS
This was a retrospective, new user cohort study using the 
Department of Defense (DoD) Military Health System (MHS) 
data, which integrates all medical, clinical, pharmacy, and 
administrative data for every eligible MHS beneficiary across the 
United States.20 The DoD is composed of active or retired ser-
vice members and their dependents, with ≈10 million patients 
actively receiving care. In accordance with transparency and 
openness promotion guidelines, the analytic methods and study 
materials will be stored at Health ResearchTx and made avail-
able to other researchers for purposes of reproducing the results 
or replicating the procedure.21 Given the patient intimacy of the 
data, study data may be made available on a case-by-case basis.
New Users Cohort Creation
The study included 2 comparator cohorts: new users of 
SGLT2i or new users of non-SGLT2i AHA on top of stan-
dard care therapy. The SGLT2i cohort included canagliflozin, 
empagliflozin, and dapagliflozin; the non-SGLT2i AHA cohort 
included dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-
like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, thiazolidinediones, 
sulfonylureas, insulin, and other AHAs (acarbose, bromocrip-
tine, miglitol, nateglinide, and repaglinide). New users were 
defined as patients whose first exposure (index date) to 1 of 
the nonmetformin AHAs during the study period from April 
1, 2013, to December 31, 2016, occurred ≥365 days after the 
start of observation in the database, with no prior exposure to 
any medication within the same AHA medication class in the 
prior 365 days. If a patient was a new user of both SGLT2i and 
non-SGLT2i AHAs, the patient would be classified as an SGLT2i 
new user, and the non-SGLT2i AHA would be considered a 
baseline or concomitant therapy. Eligible patients with T2DM 
were required to have ≥1 year of observation before the index 
date, with established CVD (including coronary artery disease, 
heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral artery 
disease) (Table I in the online-only Data Supplement), and 
be ≥18 years of age. Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, 
secondary diabetes mellitus, and missing sex data before the 
index date were excluded from this study. Patients were fol-
lowed from the index date until the first occurrence of any of 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• In this population-based cohort study of patients 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular 
disease initiated on sodium glucose cotransporter 
2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) or non-SGLT2i, initiation of 
SGLT2i was associated with a lower rate of all-
cause mortality, hospitalization for heart failure, 
and major adverse cardiovascular events.
• SGLT2i initiation was also associated with an 
≈2-fold higher risk of below-knee lower extremity 
amputation, similar to the risk observed with cana-
gliflozin in the CANVAS Program (Canagliflozin 
Cardiovascular Assessment Study).
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• This study corroborated the results of clinical trials 
and other real-world studies in showing the com-
parative effectiveness of SGLT2i on cardiovascular 
outcomes for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
and established cardiovascular disease.
• Although the study was not powered to address 
whether the risk of below-knee lower extremity 
amputation extends across the SGLT2i class, physi-
cians and patients should monitor for potential risk 
factors for below-knee lower extremity amputation 
when initiating SGLT2i in high-risk patients.

the following: (1) outcome of interest, (2) death, (3) disenroll-
ment from the DoD, or (4) last observation in the database.
To reduce confounding because of imbalance in study 
covariates, exposure propensity score (EPS) matching was 
used.22,23 A regularized logistic regression model was used to 
estimate the predicted probability of patients receiving SGLT2i 
therapy, and SGLT2i new users were EPS-matched to new users 
of non-SGLT2i AHAs in a 1:1 ratio. In creating a parsimonious 
model for EPS estimation, a systematic approach to variable 
selection was utilized. Approximately 1000 variables were 
considered for model inclusion, including patient demograph-
ics and characteristics, duration of diabetes mellitus, baseline 
comorbidities and medication use, comprehensive diagnoses 
and procedures mapped to respective Clinical Classifications 
Software categories, a calculated Charlson Comorbidity Index 
score, and various healthcare resource utilization measures. 
Baseline measures were assessed over 2 time periods, the full 
preindex period spanning back to April 1, 2008, and a 1-year 
preindex period, with the ability for all variables across both 
periods to be included in the final model.
The regularized logistic regression model was fit using a 
cyclic coordinate descending approach with L1 penalty (ie, least 
absolute shrinkage and selection operator [LASSO])24 to avoid 
overfitting of the model. This process permits a large number 
of predictors within the model. Cross-validation was utilized to 
estimate optimal regularization hyperparameters. The number 
of unique baseline AHA medications was included in the EPS 
model to factor in differences in background AHA therapy. By 
design, the new use of other non-SGLT2i AHAs defined the con-
trol new-user exposure group and necessitated specific prescrip-
tions of these drugs before the index date to not be included in 
the EPS estimation to avoid multicollinearity. Once the EPS scores 
were estimated, conventional greedy algorithms with nearest 
neighbor matching was used to create 2 balanced cohorts and 
minimize the absolute difference in EPS between the treatment 
cohorts. Maximum matching caliper of the EPS (on the logit 
scale) was 20% of the SD of the logit of the EPS.25 The final 
model used to estimate the EPS incorporated >850 variables.
Study Outcomes
The primary outcome of the study was the composite of ACM 
and HHF. In addition, a composite of MACE (ACM, nonfatal MI, 
and nonfatal stroke) and a composite of MACE + HHF, as well 
as the individual component of the composite end points, were 
evaluated. Analyses of MACE and BKA were later included in 
the study based on protocol amendments. MI and stroke events 
were considered nonfatal if patients did not die during hospi-
talization for the index event. BKA was assessed as a safety end 
point and encompasses minor (digits, partial foot, and ankle 
disarticulation) and major (below-knee) amputations.
ACM was defined as any record of death regardless of 
cause; MHS death records are compiled from inpatient hos-
pitalization discharge dispositions from military and civil-
ian hospitals, ambulatory and outpatient encounter records 
with recorded death disposition, casualty death feed related 
to active duty service members, survivor self-report, and an 
established, recurring Social Security Death Index feed from 
the Social Security Administration. Because the cause of death 
was not explicitly reported in healthcare records, death due 
to CVD was not further differentiated or analyzed. MI, stroke, 
and HHF were ascertained based on diagnosis codes, whereas 
BKA was based on procedure codes (Table II in the online-
only Data Supplement). Patients with a history of BKA events 
before the index exposure were excluded from comparative 
analyses of BKA to avoid potentially uncontrolled confound-
ing (inherent intrasubject risk) and the situation where such 
patients may be no longer at risk for future amputation events 
(depending on the location of a prior amputation event).
Sample Size and Power Estimation
This study was event-driven. Assumptions for sample size cal-
culation were based on results of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME 
trial, assuming that cardioprotection is a class effect of SGLT2i. 
Based on the study protocol at the time of the analyses, it 
was estimated that a combined total of 434 composite ACM 
and HHF events would be required to detect a relative risk 
reduction of 25% with 85% power and a type 1 error rate 
of 0.05 (2-sided). Assuming a control event rate of 3.0 per 
100 person-years, this resulted in an estimated sample size 
requirement of ≈11 
400 matched new AHA users (1:1 match-
ing ratio), adjusting for a 15% annual dropout rate.
Statistical Analyses
For descriptive statistics, frequencies and proportions were 
presented for categorical variables, whereas means and SDs 
were presented for continuous variables. Incidence rates were 
estimated using event counts and exposure follow-up time. 
Kaplan-Meier plots were generated to characterize the contour 
of risk over time for each outcome. Conditional Cox propor-
tional hazards regression based on time to first event was used 
to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs), comparing the treatment effect of SGLT2i against non-
SGLT2i AHAs (reference group) in relation to each study end 
point. Outcomes data were analyzed both by intent-to-treat 
(ITT) and on-treatment, the latter of which included the out-
comes of interest observed while exposed to the index therapy 
plus 7 days, to consider immediate biological effects. Because 
the results were generally consistent between both approaches, 
for the purpose of this reporting, we primarily focused on the 
ITT results, unless otherwise specified. Although the formal 
statistical analyses focused on the comparison of SGLT2i new 
users versus non-SGLT2i new users, additional descriptive data 
(eg, event rates) were summarized based on individual SGLT2i 
drugs (ie, canagliflozin, empagliflozin, and dapagliflozin) and 
non-SGLT2i therapeutic classes (ie, DPP-4, GLP-1, thiazolidin-
ediones, sulfonylureas, insulin, and other AHAs).
As part of sensitivity analyses for efficacy end points, 
patients receiving insulin, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinedio-
nes were removed (individually and collectively) from the 
non-SGLT2i cohort along with their SGLT2i matching pairs 
to further evaluate treatment effect, allowing the remain-
ing matched cohort to be compared using the same condi-
tional Cox proportional hazards model and determination 
of whether a specific AHA class contributed disproportion-
ately to the results, as done previously.11,26 The study protocol 
also specified several subgroup analyses, including sex, age, 
recent insulin use (past 12 months), recent GLP-1 agonist use, 
history of heart failure, recent HHF (past 12 months), CVD 
type, renal disease by Charlson Comorbidity Index score, and

chronic renal disease. A post hoc sensitivity analysis exclud-
ing patients with dementia, a surrogate for frailty, was also 
explored. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by 
the DoD Institutional Review Board, and all analyses were per-
formed by a research organization (Health ResearchTx, LLC) 
using SAS V9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).
RESULTS
Study Population
Overall, 111 
576 new users of an AHA with T2DM and 
established CVD were identified during the study pe-
riod, among which 13 
757 were new users of an SGLT2i 
and 97 
819 of a non-SGLT2i AHA. After EPS match-
ing, 25 
258 patients were ultimately matched and se-
lected for comparison. Specifically, 12 
629 (91.8% re-
tention of the total 13 
757 eligible) new users of an 
SGLT2i were matched 1:1 with 12 
629 new users of a 
non-SGLT2i AHA. Among the SGLT2i therapies, 7333 
(58.1%) patients initiated canagliflozin, 3341 (26.4%) 
empagliflozin, and 1955 (15.5%) dapagliflozin.
Key clinical characteristics among new users of an 
AHA are presented in the Table before and after EPS 
matching. Before matching, compared with new us-
ers of non-SGLT2i AHAs, patients newly prescribed an 
SGLT2i therapy at baseline were younger, were more 
frequently white, had a longer duration of T2DM, and 
less frequently had a history of atrial fibrillation, heart 
failure, cardiomyopathy, MI, ischemic stroke, periph-
eral artery disease, chronic kidney disease, malignancy, 
and dementia. In addition, new users of an SGLT2i pre-
sented with higher rates of background treatment with 
all of the other AHAs and combination therapies with 
metformin.
After EPS matching, all baseline patient character-
istics included in the EPS model were well balanced 
(standardized differences <0.1 for all baseline char-
acteristics after propensity matching) (Figure I in the 
online-only Data Supplement). Among the matched 
cohort, the mean age was 65.8 (SD, 9.4) years, 44.1% 
were female, the mean duration of T2DM was 5.6 
(SD, 2.0) years, and the mean duration of CVD was 
4.4 (SD, 2.2) years. Approximately 14.1% of patients 
had a history of atrial fibrillation, 22.8% had a history 
of congestive heart failure, 10.7% had a history of 
ischemic stroke, and 16.6% had a history of MI. At 
baseline, among the matched cohort overall, 80.7% 
of patients were treated with metformin and 19.7% 
with insulin. 
The median follow-up time was 1.6 years (interquar-
tile range, 0.79–2.4) for the ITT cohort (1.7 and 1.5 
years with SGLT2i and non-SGLT2i AHAs, respectively) 
and 0.67 years (interquartile range, 0.25–1.5) for the 
on-treatment cohort (0.72 and 0.63 years with SGLT2i 
and non-SGLT2i AHAs, respectively).
CV Outcomes
The primary composite outcome of ACM and HHF and 
secondary end points of MACE and individual compo-
nents of these outcomes for patients in the ITT EPS-
matched cohort are shown in Figure 1. The incidence 
rate of the primary outcome was 1.73 versus 3.01 per 
100 person-years among new users of SGLT2i and non-
SGLT2i AHAs, respectively (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.50–
0.65; P<0.0001) (Figure 1). Similarly, compared with 
non-SGLT2i AHAs, initiation of an SGLT2i was associ-
ated with a lower rate of ACM (1.29 versus 2.26 events 
per 100 person-years; HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.49–0.66; 
P<0.0001) and HHF (0.51 versus 0.90 events per 100 
person-years; HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.45–0.73; P<0.0001). 
The treatment benefit associated with SGLT2i started 
early and persisted over the study period (Figure 2).
Within the ITT EPS-matched cohort, the rate of 
MACE (the composite of ACM, nonfatal MI, and non-
fatal stroke) was also lower in patients newly initiat-
ed on an SGLT2i compared with a non-SGLT2i (2.31 
versus 3.45 per 100 person-years; HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 
0.60–0.75; P<0.0001). The rate of the individual end 
points of nonfatal MI (0.58 versus 0.71 per 100 per-
son-years; HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.64–1.03; P=0.09) and 
nonfatal stroke (0.51 versus 0.60 per 100 person-years; 
HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.66–1.10; P=0.22) were not sig-
nificantly different. When ACM, nonfatal heart failure, 
and atherothrombotic end points were considered in 
a single composite outcome, the rate of the compos-
ite of MACE and HHF was significantly lower among 
patients newly initiated on an SGLT2i compared with 
a non-SGLT2i (2.72 versus 4.11 per 100 person-years; 
HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.60–0.74; P<0.0001).
Overall, the association of treatment effects with the 
primary and secondary outcomes was qualitatively similar 
in the on-treatment analysis, albeit more amplified (Fig-
ure II in the online-only Data Supplement). Analysis of the 
primary outcome in the prespecified subgroups showed 
consistent results after initiation of an SGLT2i compared 
with another class of AHA across subgroups based on 
sex, age, insulin or GLP-1 agonist use within the prior 
12 months, history of heart failure, CVD type, and renal 
disease (Figure III in the online-only Data Supplement). 
Results of sensitivity analyses that removed patients treat-
ed with insulin, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones at 
baseline were consistent with the overall study results 
(Figure IV in the online-only Data Supplement). Results 
of the sensitivity analyses that removed patients with de-
mentia at baseline were also consistent with the overall 
study results (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.51–0.66).

DISCUSSION
EASEL was a population-based study of patients en-
rolled in 1 of the largest public health insurance claims 
programs in the United States, designed to examine 
the clinical effectiveness and safety of SGLT2i in pa-
tients with T2DM and established CVD in routine clini-
cal practice. Compared with patients initiated on other 
AHAs, we observed a 33 to 43% lower rate of ACM, 
HHF, and MACE among patients with T2DM with es-
tablished CVD who were newly treated with an SGLT2i. 
We also found a modestly lower risk of the individu-
al CV end points of nonfatal MI and nonfatal stroke, 
findings that did not reach statistical significance. The 
lower risk of HHF with SGLT2i therapy seen in this study 
was consistent with findings reported in the EMPA-REG 
OUTCOME and CANVAS Program trials and the CVD-
REAL study of empagliflozin, canagliflozin, and SGLT2i 
therapy, in general, respectively.6,8,11 EASEL is also the 
first population-based study to demonstrate a lower 
risk of MACE in patients with T2DM with established 
CVD initiated on SGLT2i therapy, which is qualitatively 
similar to what was seen in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME 
and CANVAS Program trials.6,8
This is also the first observational study to our knowl-
edge to identify a significantly higher risk of BKA as-
sociated with SGLT2i initiation in routine clinical prac-
tice, although cases were infrequent. The higher risk 
of BKA associated with SGLT2i therapy in this study of 
high-risk patients with established CVD was similar to 
that reported in the CANVAS Program of canagliflozin, 
although the rate of BKA was lower in both the SGLT2i 
and non-SGLT2i cohorts.8 A higher incidence of BKA 
was not seen among the infrequent events reported in 
the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial of empagliflozin, but 
there are limited data on BKA events within this class 
of medication overall.13,27 In the current study, most ex-
posure to SGLT2i therapies, and thus most BKA events, 
occurred in new users of canagliflozin. However, be-
cause of the limited number of prescriptions of other 
SGLT2i drugs to date, formal statistical comparisons are 
currently not precise for evaluating the effectiveness or 
risk between individual SGLT2i therapies, even with ap-
propriate adjustments for confounding.
The approach of the ITT and on-treatment analy-
ses resulted in fairly consistent results, although with 
an attenuation of the effect sizes for CV benefit with-
in the ITT analysis. This observation, in part, may be 
a result of the 0.96-year median difference between 
exposure time (on-treatment) and overall follow-up 
time (ITT) because of premature discontinuation of 
SGLT2i therapy. Further, it supports the notion that, 
because these agents’ cardiometabolic and hemody-
namic effects are time-dependent, expected CV ben-
efits are sensitive to prompt attenuation on discontin-
uation. Similar to the results from the current study, 
an early CV benefit with SGLT2 inhibition was sug-
gested by the early separation of the Kaplan-Meier 
curves for HHF and CV death seen with empagliflozin 
in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial and with cana-
gliflozin in the CANVAS Program.6,8 Despite general 
consistency in the findings across the studies, residual 
bias associated with observational studies cannot be 
completely ruled out. Our baseline data showed that 
patients initiated on SGLT2i therapy tended to have 
a higher frequency of use of other AHAs at baseline 
as compared with the non-SGLT2i cohort, which may 
suggest difficulties with glycemic control and a more 
advanced stage of T2DM for patients initiated on 
SGLT2i therapy. Nevertheless, results for the primary 
effectiveness and safety outcomes were consistent 
across a number of prespecified subgroups, includ-
ing patients with and without recent use of insulin 
or GLP-1 agonists, as well as among females and 
males, older and younger patients, and patients with 
or without established heart failure, peripheral artery 
disease, or renal disease.
The crude data for the CV benefits appeared to be 
consistent across the individual drugs within the class 
of currently approved SGLT2i. There were, however, 
few amputation events among empagliflozin, dapa-
gliflozin, and canagliflozin alone to derive individual 
risk estimates for formal statistical comparison. Al-
though there was a numeric imbalance in amputations 
observed among patients treated with canagliflozin 
compared with their propensity-matched cohort treat-
ed with non-SGLT2i AHAs, the propensity model was 
developed based on available clinical characteristics 
across the entire study cohort. Thus, although each pa-
tient may have a matched pair based on the propensity 
score, at the individual treatment level, the matched 
cohorts may not be equally balanced on all major con-
founding factors, particularly in relation to BKA. More-
over, the extremely small numbers of events observed 
in the matched pairs of individual treatment-level pa-
tients preclude any meaningful statistical evaluation 
or clinical conclusion. Longer follow-up and exposure 
time as well as additional sources of data will likely 
provide more precise estimates for intra- and interdrug 
comparisons. In addition, further research in this field

is urgently needed to clarify the mechanism of action 
and identify which patients are most susceptible to 
amputation risk.
This study has a number of strengths. First, with a 
contemporary and diverse cohort of >111 
000 newly 
treated patients with T2DM and established CVD, we 
were able to establish comparable treatment cohorts 
and had robust statistical precision to investigate effi-
cacy end points (a combined total of >700 on-treatment 
and 1400 ITT events) and explore safety hypotheses. 
Moreover, the database used for this study is generally 
representative of many demographic and clinical char-
acteristics of the US population. Furthermore, we uti-
lized a strategy of establishing a base cohort from which 
to distinguish new AHA initiation from prevalent users, 
reduce the risk of left truncation, and optimize the de-
tection of key baseline characteristics, including dura-
tion of diabetes mellitus. This approach also improved 
the efficiency and optimization of the propensity score-
matching algorithm. Finally, the DoD MHS has extensive 
drug coverage and more longitudinal data than most 
comparable health insurance claims data available to 
investigate this new class of AHAs in routine practice.
There are, however, limitations to our study, which 
underscore that our results should be interpreted with 
caution and require independent replication. First, the 
MHS database lacked sufficient determinants of the 
cause of death, and we were therefore limited to as-
sessing ACM rather than CV death. However, >50% of 
the cause of death in this high-risk cohort with T2DM 
was expected to be from CV causes.6,8,28 Second, given 
the dynamic nature of T2DM pharmacotherapy, our 
analysis may be susceptible to unmeasured confound-
ing and residual bias. To reduce this risk, differences in 
baseline clinical and demographic characteristics were 
adjusted for by the use of a highly efficient propen-
sity score-matching algorithm. Residual imbalance in 
specific classes of baseline AHA medication use, how-
ever, although minimal, was seen and expected after 
EPS matching. This is because the new use of specific 
classes of non-SGLT2i AHAs defined the control group’s 
new-user exposure status (as opposed to a clinical trial 
that compared new use of SGLT2i therapy versus new 
use of placebo). This study design reduces selection bias 
but necessitated specific prescriptions of these drugs 
before the index date to not be included in the EPS es-
timation to avoid multicollinearity. Instead, to account 
for potential differences in background AHA therapy, 
the number of unique baseline AHA medications was 
factored into the EPS model, and this was well balanced 
after matching. Moreover, except for SGLT2i therapy, 
other AHA therapies (either as baseline or new use) 
were comparable between the 2 treatment groups. 
Therefore, any residual imbalance at baseline in classes 
of baseline AHA medication use would not be expected 
to significantly impact our results. Nevertheless, our es-
timates of CV risk reduction appear to be exaggerated 
compared with the findings reported in large outcome 
trials despite similar rates of drug discontinuation.6,8 
This observed difference underscores that caution is 
due for any direct comparison of the results between 
clinical trials and observational studies. Unmeasured 
confounding cannot be totally ruled out, and there-
fore additional research might be warranted for further 
evaluation. Third, we relied on pharmaceutical dispens-
ing records to infer medication use. However, misclassi-
fication of the exposure would suggest that any results 
we observed were biased toward the null.
In conclusion, the role of pharmacoepidemiologic 
studies goes beyond an ability to validate whether clini-
cal trial results are reproducible in a generalizable pa-
tient population. Observational studies are also critical in 
filling a knowledge gap to inform about the real-world 
effectiveness of new therapies and potentially serious 
adverse events not readily detected in clinical trials. Our 
findings in a cohort with T2DM and established CVD 
support those recently seen in 2 large CV outcome tri-
als—that initiation of SGLT2i is associated with a lower 
risk of mortality, HHF, and MACE. However, the use of 
SGLT2i was also associated with an ≈2-fold higher risk of 
BKA, a serious adverse event seen in a similar magnitude 
within the CANVAS Program of canagliflozin. Although 
these observations require replication in other settings, 
our findings underscore the potential CV benefit and a 
rare but serious risk that physicians and patients should 
monitor for when initiating this class of medication.
