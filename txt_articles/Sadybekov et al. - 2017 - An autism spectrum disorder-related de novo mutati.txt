The Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RhoGEF) Trio promotes actin polymerization by
directly activating the small GTPase Rac1. Recent studies suggest that autism spectrum
disorder (ASD)-related behavioral phenotypes in animal models of ASD can be produced by
dysregulation of Rac1’s control of actin polymerization at glutamatergic synapses. Here, in
humans, we discover a large cluster of ASD-related de novo mutations in Trio’s Rac1 acti-
vating domain, GEF1. Our study reveals that these mutations produce either hypofunctional or
hyperfunctional forms of Trio in rodent neurons in vitro. In accordance with pathological
increases or decreases in glutamatergic neurotransmission observed in animal models of
ASD, we find that these mutations result in either reduced synaptic AMPA receptor
expression or enhanced glutamatergic synaptogenesis. Together, our findings implicate both
excessive and reduced Trio activity and the resulting synaptic dysfunction in ASD-related
pathogenesis, and point to the Trio-Rac1 pathway at glutamatergic synapses as a possible key
point of convergence of many ASD-related genes.

 I
t is estimated that ~ 1% of the human population has a
disorder on the Autism spectrum. Autism-spectrum disorders
or ASDs are a range of neurodevelopmental disorders that
are characterized by impaired social interaction, communication
and restricted and repetitive behavior. About 40% of individuals
with ASD also display some form of developmental delay
while 70% display some level of intellectual disability. There is a
strong genetic basis for ASD, and recent studies now establish
an important role of germline de novo mutation in ASD-risk.
De novo mutations identified in large exome sequencing studies
have identified a number of new candidate ASD-risk genes
and have ultimately led to a revised model for causation1. Over
the past 10 years, evidence has also grown suggesting a
convergence on altered regulation of glutamatergic synaptic
development
and
function
in ASD2–4.
Disrupted
synaptic
actin modulation at glutamatergic synapses has been identified in
well-established animal models of ASD, and in some cases has
been identified as the underlying cause of ASD-related behavioral
phenotypes in these models5–7. Rac1-mediated synaptic actin
regulation in particular has been implicated in ASD and has
been proposed as a likely point of convergence of many known
ASD risk genes5, 6, 8.
We have recently discovered that the Rho guanine nucleotide
exchange factor (RhoGEF) protein Trio, along with its paralog
Kalirin,
is
required
for
glutamatergic
neurotransmission9.
Trio expression in the brain is highest in late prenatal/early
postnatal development while Kalirin expression does not reach its
peak until adolescence10–12. Multiple isoforms of Trio originating
from a single gene are expressed in the brain13. Trio-9, for
example, is the predominant isoform expressed in the cortex
and hippocampus. Both Trio and Kalirin reside within the
postsynaptic compartment of glutamatergic synapses referred to
as dendritic spines10, 14. In spines, these two proteins regulate
glutamatergic synapse function through the ability of their GEF1
domains to promote Rac1-dependent actin polymerization9, 15, 16.
Furthermore, we have found that Trio and Kalirin are targets of
CaMKII phosphorylation that are required for the induction
of Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)9, the cellular process believed
to underlie learning and memory. Thus, these proteins play
fundamental roles in glutamatergic synapse regulation.
Here we identify a large cluster of ASD-related de novo
mutations
in the Rac1-activation
domain of
Trio, GEF1.
The degree of mutational clustering that we find in Trio’s
GEF1 domain and the computationally predicted impact of these
ASD-related de novo mutations on Trio-Rac1 interactions
suggest a strong association of Trio-Rac1 pathway dysregulation
in ASD-related pathologies. Systematic examination of these
mutations in Trio-9 reveals both hypomorphic and hypermorphic
mutations that dramatically and bidirectionally affect Trio’s
function and Trio’s influence on glutamatergic neurotransmission
in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Animal models of ASD
exhibit pathological increases and decreases in glutamatergic
neurotransmission17–19.
Our
study
uncovers
ASD-related
missense mutations in a single synaptic Rac1-activating protein
that can produce bidirectional alterations of glutamatergic
neurotransmission
and
thus
implicates
both
reduced
and
excessive Trio activity and the resulting synaptic dysfunction in
ASD-related disease.
Results
ASD-related mutations in Trio. Recent whole-exome sequencing
studies have proved fruitful in uncovering risk-conferring
variations,
primarily
by
enumerating
de
novo
variations,
which
are
sufficiently
rare
that
multiple
mutations
in
a
gene suggest a link to ASD. We queried several large databases
of de novo mutations found specifically in individuals with
ASD
or
ASD-related
disorders
(i.e.
intellectual
disability
and neurodevelopmental disorders), looking for ASD-related
mutations in either Trio or Kalirin1, 20–24. Together these studies
included 4890 individuals with ASD-related disease. We found
no ASD-related mutations in Kalirin but found a surprisingly
large number of highly clustered ASD-related mutations in
Trio’s GEF1 domain, specifically within the DH1 subdomain
(GEF1/DH1) (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). Trio’s GEF1/
DH1 subdomain binds directly to Rac1 and is essential for
Trio’s ability to promote actin polymerization25, 26. The GEF1/
DH1 subdomain of only 175 amino acids harbors six de novo
missense mutations (Fig. 1a), as well as a single nucleotide
deletion resulting in the formation of a stop codon inside
Trio’s GEF1/DH1 subdomain (Fig. 1b). In addition, another
individual was identified where a 16 exon deletion of the TRIO
gene results in the removal of the entire GEF1 domain (Fig. 1c).
We also found two missense mutations in Trio’s spectrin repeat
region and one missense mutation in the PH subdomain of Trio’s
GEF2 domain (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). None of these
mutations were observed in the genomic sequences of family
member controls1, 20–24. The number of observed de novo
mutations in TRIO across these studies was on par with numbers
of mutations in well-established ASD-related genes (e.g., SCN2A,
SYNGAP, SHANK2 and SHANK3 and MECP2), however, TRIO’s

subdomain
had
the
highest
mutation
rate
per sequence base among these genes (Supplementary Table 2).
According to the recent Exome Aggregation Consortium
(ExAC) analysis, based on 60,706 fully sequenced human
genomes, TRIO is one of the top 60 most constrained human
genes, suggesting a high functional importance. Trio has an
exceptionally low rate of both missense mutations (z = 6.29) and
loss of function (LoF) nonsense mutations (pLi = 1.), while
having an average rate of synonymous mutations (z = 0.19)27.
Even more striking is the constraint in the GEF1/DH1 domain.
Remarkably, we observed no missense or loss of function (LoF)
mutations in the GEF1/DH1 domain in 9,937 control genomes24
(Table 1 and Fig. 2a), thus indicating a strong enrichment of
ASD-related mutations in this region (Fig. 2b). We also found
no missense mutations in the GEF1/DH1 domain in the 1000
Genomes database28 (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Importantly,
synonymous mutations listed in the 1000 Genomes database
were present in this region (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Taken
together, these data point to a strong enrichment of ASD-related
de novo mutations in the GEF1/DH1 region of Trio.
To assess significance of the Trio protein and Trio-GEF1/DH1
domain mutations in ASD-related disorders, we compared
the expected number of de novo mutations to that observed.
We used the mutational model developed by Samocha et al.29.
The results of Samocha et al. were based on 1078 ASD cases and
151 cases of intellectual disability, and this study was able to
identify SCN2A and SYNGAP as significant in ASD-related
disorders. In the present study, our much larger case number
(4890 for ASD-related disorders) and the large number of
missense mutations identified in TRIO (11 ASD cases, as
compared to 1.07 cases expected for the same number of
individuals in the general population) dramatically improved the
statistics, leading to a highly significant whole genome association
of TRIO with ASD-like syndromes (P-value of < 1.96 × 10−8;
Supplementary Table 3). We found an even stronger association
with ASD-related syndromes for the Rac1 interacting GEF1/
DH1 subdomain of TRIO (7 cases compared to 0.06 expected, P-
value < 5.5 × 1−13; Supplementary Table 3).
ASD mutations in Trio are predicted to alter Rac1 activation.
The clustered nature of Trio’s de novo mutations affecting the
GEF1/DH1 subdomain suggests a connection to ASD. While the
nonsense and copy number mutants (Fig. 1b, c) would apparently
result in loss of Trio interactions with Rac1, the effects of the
missense mutations (Fig. 1a) remain to be identified. We used
structure-based modeling to assess the possibility that these
mutations disrupt the ability of Trio’s GEF1/DH1 domain to
activate Rac1. The structure of Trio’s GEF1 domain in complex
with Rac1 has been solved25 (Fig. 3), which allows accurate
conformational modeling and evaluation of mutation effects on
stability and Rac1 binding (Fig. 3 and Table 2). Of the six mis-
sense mutations identified related to Trio’s GEF1/DH1 domain,
five were predicted to disrupt GEF1-mediated Rac1 activation
(Table 2). Two of these mutations (R1312W and R1428Q) were
predicted
to
destabilize
the
3D
structure
of
Trio’s
DH1 subdomain due to internal clashes and disruption of the
internal hydrogen bonding network. The other three mutations
(K1431M, P1461T and P1461L) were predicted to directly
interfere with the ability of Trio’s DH1 subdomain to interact
with Rac1 due to disruption of the intermolecular hydrogen
bonding
network
(K1431M)
or
changing
the
backbone
conformation of the protein at the interaction interface (P1461T
and P1461L) (Fig. 3 and Table 2). All five of these mutations were
found to be within 6 Å from the Rac1-interacting interface of the
GEF1/DH1 subdomain. One notable exception among the GEF1/
DH1 mutations, however, was D1368V, which is located away
from the Rac1 interface, does not make any intramolecular
interactions, and was predicted to not impact Rac1 activation.
Here we find that this mutation has neurobiological consequences
distinct from the other ASD-related GEF1/DH1 mutations
characterized below. Modeling data along with available patient
information were used to select specific ASD-related missense
mutations for further study.
Trio-9 I1329HLAL* expression inhibits synaptic function. The
first mutation we examined was Trio-9 I1329HLAL* (Fig. 4a).
This nonsense mutation, found in an individual diagnosed
with
ASD,
results
in
truncation
of
Trio
inside
its
GEF1/DH1 subdomain and eliminates the Rac1 interface of this
region. To examine the impact this mutation has on the ability of
Trio-9 to activate Rac1 we used a recently developed fluorescence
resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based biosensor that measures
the ability of RhoGEFs to activate Rac130. Initially we transfected
HEK293 cells with this Rac1 biosensor and wild-type Trio-9.
Using fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) to detect FRET,
we found that HEK293 cells co-expressing wild-type Trio-9 and
this biosensor exhibited a much higher FRET signal relative to
cells expressing the biosensor alone (Fig. 4b and Supplementary
Fig. 2a). In the representative cell color map images, colors range
from blue (low Rac1 biosensor activation) to red (high Rac1
biosensor activation). We observed a larger population of
quenched donor molecules in the pixels located toward the cell
perimeters compared to the inner region of the cells, indicating
a higher level of Rac1 activity at these locations. In contrast to
wild-type Trio-9, the FRET signal observed in HEK293 cells co-
expressing the biosensor and Trio-9 I1329HLAL* was very low
(Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 2b). The near complete lack of
Rac1 biosensor activation observed in Trio-9 I1329HLAL*

 expressing cells looked very similar to those cells that were
transfected with the biosensor alone (Fig. 4b and Supplementary
Fig. 2b). Thus, Trio-9 I1329HLAL* dramatically reduces Trio-9-
mediated Rac1 activation.
We were then interested in the impact Trio-9 I1329HLAL*
expression has on glutamatergic synapse function. First, we used
biolistic
transfection
to
express
wild-type
Trio-9
in
CA1
pyramidal neurons of organotypic rat hippocampal slice cultures.
6 days after transfection recordings of AMPA receptor and
NMDA
receptor-evoked
excitatory
postsynaptic
currents
(AMPAR and NMDAR-eEPSCs) were made from fluorescent
transfected neurons and neighboring untransfected control
neurons simultaneously during stimulation of Schaffer collaterals
(Fig. 4c). This approach permits a pair-wise, internally controlled
comparison of the consequences of the genetic manipulation that
is not confounded by fluorophore expression (Supplementary
Fig. 3). As reported previously9, we found that expression of
Trio-9 resulted in a selective increase in AMPAR-eEPSC
amplitude
(Fig.
4d,
e,
j,
k).
Conversely,
we
found
that
knocking down Trio expression in these neurons using a short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) against Trio resulted in a selective
reduction in AMPAR-eEPSC amplitude (Fig. 4f, g, j, k).
Recombinant Trio-9 rescues synaptic phenotypes resulting from
Trio knockdown9. We then expressed Trio-9 I1329HLAL* for
6 days in CA1 pyramidal neurons. In contrast to the increase in
AMPAR-eEPSC amplitude we observed with Trio-9, Trio-9
I1329HLAL* resulted in a ~40% decrease in AMPAR-eEPSC
amplitude (Fig. 4h, j). Trio-9 I1329HLAL* expression had
no effect on NMDAR-eEPSC amplitude (Fig. 4i, k). This
phenotype was remarkably similar to that observed with the
Trio shRNA. Paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) was also unchanged
by postsynaptic expression of Trio-9 I1329HLAL* indicating that
the expression of this mutant did not affect presynaptic glutamate
release (Fig. 4l).
The
selective
reduction
we
observe
in
AMPAR-eEPSC
amplitude produced by Trio-9 I1329HLAL* expression could be
due to either a reduction in the number of AMPARs at all
glutamatergic synapses or an increase in the number of synapses
that lack AMPARs entirely. To determine which of these
possibilities had occurred we performed coefficient of variation
(CV) analysis on eEPSC current amplitudes (Fig. 4m and
Supplementary Fig. 4). CV analysis can be used to determine
the quantal parameters of glutamatergic transmission in control
and transfected neurons31–35. By comparing the normalized
variance in eEPSC amplitudes from two neurons receiving the
same stimulus, it is possible to determine relative quantal size and

 quantal content. Changes in quantal size precisely change both
the mean eEPSC and the variance such that the normalized ratio
of mean2/variance, also known as coefficient of variation (or CV),
remains constant. Changes in quantal size cause the marker of the
mean to fall on the horizontal line seen in Fig. 4m and in this
case, would denote a change in the number of glutamatergic
receptors at each synapse. In contrast, changes in quantal content
will produce proportional changes of equal magnitude in CV that
cause the marker of the mean to fall on the diagonal line and
indicate a change in the number of functional synapses. We
observed equal reductions in CV and AMPAR-eEPSC amplitude
in neurons expressing Trio-9 I1329HLAL* (Fig. 4m). This result
suggests a reduction in quantal content rather than quantal size as
responsible for this reduction of AMPAR-eEPSC amplitude.
Given that Trio-9 I1329HLAL* expression did not alter NMDAR-
eEPSC amplitude or PPF, this finding indicates that Trio-9
I1329HLAL* expression increases the number of AMPAR-less
or “silent” synapses. As with wild-type Trio-9, variation in
NMDAR-eEPSC amplitudes in Trio-9 I1329HLAL* expressing
neurons was due to variation in quantal content (Supplementary
Fig. 4a, b). Together these data suggest that Trio-9 I1329HLAL*
competes with wild-type Trio, effectively lowers the concentration
of functional Trio at glutamatergic synapses and results in a
selective
and
potentially
pathogenic
reduction
in
synaptic
AMPAR function.
Trio-9 K1431M expression inhibits synaptic function. We then
examined the Trio missense mutation, Trio-9 K1431M. The
individual harboring this mutation displayed severe autistic
symptoms and intellectual disability. It is of note that a previous
study using alanine-scanning mutations to identify important
residues in Trio’s GEF1 region identified this residue along with
R1428 as critical for Rac1 activation36. Our modeling of the
K1431M mutation predicted a disruption to a number of
hydrogen and water-mediated interactions resulting in a reduced
affinity between Trio’s GEF1/DH1 domain and Rac1 (Fig. 3 and
Table 2). FLIM analysis revealed that Trio-9 K1431M, like Trio-9
I1329HLAL*, severely reduced Trio-9’s ability to activate the Rac1
biosensor in HEK293 cells (Fig. 5b). Thus, as predicted, Rac1
activation was severely reduced by this mutation. We then
expressed Trio-9 K1431M in CA1 pyramidal neurons and
found that Trio-9 K1431M phenocopied Trio-9 I1329HLAL*.
Trio-9 K1431M produced a ~50% reduction in AMPAR-eEPSC
amplitude (Fig. 5c) that is also likely caused by an increase in
silent synapses given that a reduction in quantal content occurred
with no change in NMDAR-eEPSC amplitude or change in PPF
(Fig. 5d–f). As with wild-type Trio-9, variation in NMDAR-
eEPSC amplitudes in Trio-9 K1431M expressing neurons was due
to variation in quantal content (Supplementary Fig. 4c). Together
these
data
show
that
Trio-9
K1431M,
like
Trio-9 I1329HLAL*, likely competes with endogenous, wild-type
Trio at synapses and results in a reduction in synaptic AMPAR
function. Additionally, we found that a missense mutation in
Trio’s GEF1 domain that was identified in an individual without
ASD (Trio-9 S1575N)28 had no effect on Trio-9’s ability to
increase AMPAR-eEPSC amplitude in CA1 pyramidal neurons
(Supplementary Fig. 1a and 5).

 the interaction between Trio’s GEF1/DH1 domain and Rac1 were
two mutations in the P1461 position, P1461T and P1461L (Fig. 3,
Table 2 and Fig. 6a). Both individuals had severe neurodevelop-
mental disorders. de novo mutations in the same protein residue
position in two unrelated individuals with similar disorders
strongly suggests that such mutations contribute to the develop-
ment of the disorder. As both mutations were predicted to
destabilize Rac1 binding, we examined the impact P1461T has on
Trio-9 function. While we did observe some FRET in HEK293
cells expressing Trio-9 P1461T and the Rac1 biosensor, the level
of biosensor activation in these cells was lower than those cells
expressing wild-type Trio-9 (Fig. 6b). Thus, this mutation lowers
Trio’s ability to activate Rac1, albeit not to the extent observed
with Trio-9 I1329HLAL* and Trio-9 K1431M. Even though this
mutation resulted in a less severe inhibition of Trio-9’s ability to
activate Rac1, expression of Trio-9 P1461T in neurons led to a
synaptic phenotype that was similar to Trio-9 I1329HLAL* and
Trio-9 K1431M. Like Trio-9 I1329HLAL* and Trio-9 K1431M,
Trio-9 P1461T expression in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal
neurons reduced AMPAR-eEPSC amplitude (Fig. 6c) by reducing
quantal content without affecting NMDAR-eEPSC amplitude
or PPF (Fig. 6d–f). As with wild-type Trio-9, variation in
NMDAR-eEPSC
amplitudes
in
Trio-9
P1461T
expressing
neurons was due to variation in quantal content (Supplementary
Fig. 4d). Together, these findings again suggest an increase in
silent
synapse
number.
Thus,
Trio-9
I1329HLAL*,
Trio-9
K1431M and Trio-9 P1461T expression in neurons impact
glutamatergic neurotransmission in a similar manner.
Trio-9 D1368V results in Trio hyperfunction. Lastly, we
examined the impact of the GEF1/DH1 D1368V missense
mutation found in an individual with severe intellectual disability.
Unlike all the other ASD-related GEF1/DH1 missense mutations
that have been identified, the D1368 residue is highly exposed to
solvent, and is located in the GEF1/DH1 subdomain far away
from the Rac1 binding interface (Fig. 3 and Fig. 7a). Indeed, our
modeling of this mutation did not predict any direct impact on
the stability of Trio’s GEF1 domain or its ability to activate Rac1
(Fig. 3 and Table 2). Therefore, we were curious if this muta-
tion has any impact on Trio-9 function. We observed higher
levels
of
Rac1
biosensor
activation
in
cells
expressing
Trio-9 D1368V compared to wild-type Trio-9 (Fig. 7b); this
unexpected finding suggested that Trio-9 D1368V increases
Trio’s ability to activate Rac1. Remarkably, we found that
expression of Trio-9 D1368V in CA1 pyramidal neurons resulted
in a dramatic increase in AMPAR-eEPSC amplitude that was
about twice that seen with wild-type Trio-9 (Fig. 7c). Trio-9
D1368V expression in CA1 pyramidal neurons also led to an
unexpected increase in NMDAR-eEPSC amplitude (Fig. 7d). PPF
was not affected by this mutation (Fig. 7e). To determine whether
the observed enhancements of AMPAR and NMDAR-mediated
transmission were produced by an increase in the number of
glutamatergic synapses or an increase in the expression of
AMPARs and NMDARs at existing synapses we again performed
CV analysis. We found that increases in both AMPAR and
NMDAR-eEPSC amplitude likely result from changes in quantal
content rather than quantal size (Fig. 7f). This finding suggested
that Trio-9 D1368V-mediated enhancement of AMPAR and
NMDAR function is produced by an increase in the number of
functional glutamatergic synapses. We reasoned that if Trio-9
D1368V
expression
leads
to
the
formation
of
additional
glutamatergic
synapses,
then
a
corresponding
increase
in
dendritic spine density should be observed in these neurons. We
used Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM) to obtain super
resolution images of dendritic spines from neurons expressing
GFP, wild-type Trio-9 or Trio-9 D1368V. While wild-type Trio-9
expression had no effect on dendritic spine density, expression of
Trio-9 D1368V resulted in a greater than twofold increase in the
density of dendritic spines compared to GFP expressing control
neurons (Fig. 7g). Together these data reveal that the Trio-9
D1368V mutation is a hypermorphic mutation resulting in a
hyperfunctioning synaptogenic form of Trio that when expressed
in neurons is capable of producing an abnormally high number of
glutamatergic synapses.
Discussion
Here
we
find
a
hotspot
of
de
novo
ASD-related
mutations clustered specifically in Trio’s GEF1/DH1 subdomain
(P-value < 5.5 × 10−13). Such a high number of potentially
function-disrupting mutations suggests that these mutations
contribute
to
the
development
of
ASD-related
disorders.
In support of this hypothesis, we found that every GEF1/DH1
ASD-related mutation we tested greatly altered Trio’s influence
on
glutamatergic
synapse
function
in
the
hippocampus.
We identify both hypomorphic and hypermorphic ASD-related
mutations in Trio, thus implicating reduced as well as excessive
Trio activity in ASD-related pathogenesis. Trio’s involvement
in ASD-related disease is further reinforced by recent human
genome analysis studies that rank TRIO among their top
ASD-candidate genes37.

 Specific association of Trio mutations with ASD is supported
by analysis of its close paralog, Kalirin, which has a unique
developmental expression profile. No ASD-associated missense
mutations were observed in Kalirin, despite playing a similar role
in glutamatergic synapse regulation9. Trio is highly expressed in
early postnatal development and decreases with age10. In contrast,
Kalirin
expression
does
not
peak
until
adolescence11,
12.
Remarkably, Kalirin function has been implicated in later onset
neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s
disease38–41. A missense mutation in Kalirin’s GEF1/DH1
domain that inhibited Rac1 activation has also been found in an
individual with schizophrenia39. Thus, the expression profiles
of Trio and Kalirin appear to match the age of onset of the
diseases in which they are implicated, and suggest that disruption
of Rac1-mediated synaptic regulation at different time points of
brain development gives rise to distinct brain-related diseases.
Dysregulation of glutamatergic transmission is believed to
underlie the development of ASD, and existing animal models of
ASD
display
varied
glutamatergic
synapse
phenotypes2.
MeCP2Tg1 and MET knockout mice, for example, display
enhanced
glutamatergic
neurotransmission
while
SHANK3
knockout and MeCP2null/y mice display deficits in glutamatergic
signaling17–19. While the mechanisms underlying the glutama-
tergic synapse phenotypes observed in these animals are unclear,
such data suggest that alteration of glutamatergic synaptic
strength in either direction during synapse formation in early
postnatal development likely results in global network changes
contributing to ASD-related disease. By regulating actin filament
formation through its GEF1 domain, Trio regulates glutamatergic
synapse function via its effect on synaptic structure. Here we find
that ASD-related missense mutations in Trio give rise to both
decreased and increased glutamatergic synaptic function resulting
from an increase in silent synapse number or enhanced

 synaptogenic capability, respectively. Thus, our data suggest that
pathological repercussions result from both Trio hypofunction
and Trio hyperfunction during development. Furthermore,
to the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to show that
ASD-related missense mutations in a single protein can produce
bidirectional alterations of glutamatergic synapse function.
Our modeling and FLIM analysis identify the majority of Trio’s
ASD-related GEF1/DH1 mutations as detrimental to Trio’s
ability to activate Rac1. We also find that expression of several
hypomorphic ASD-related Trio mutants in CA1 pyramidal
neurons leads to selective reductions in AMPAR-eEPSC ampli-
tude. While the exact mechanism of ASD-related hypomorphic
mutations reducing synaptic AMPAR expression is unknown, the
likely explanation is that the expressed hypomorphic Trio
mutants compete with wild-type Trio for access to synapses and
effectively lower the synaptic concentration of functional Trio. It
is additionally possible that these hypomorphic Trio proteins that
lack functional GEF1 domains compete with wild-type Trio for
association with key synaptic regulatory protein complexes.
Alternatively, expressed hypomorphic Trio mutants may target
and promote degradation of wild-type Trio through some
unknown mechanism. Such antagonistic relationships between
hypomorphic and wild-type forms of Trio are important because
the individuals that harbor the de novo Trio mutations described
in this study are heterozygous for these mutations. Given that the
majority of ASD-related mutations in Trio’s GEF1/DH1 domain
potentially work against wild-type Trio function, these indivi-
duals are expected to have a level of Trio function below what
would occur with a simple deletion of one copy of the gene.
Alternatively, it is possible that these ASD-related Trio mutations
are expressed at lower levels compared to wild-type Trio or are
mis-targeted and thus do not reach synapses. However, we would

 presume that if these were the primary effects of these mutations,
overexpression of such mutants would produce either smaller
increases in AMPAR-eEPSC amplitude or simply produce no
effect on synaptic transmission relative to control neurons. What
we observe with hypomorphic Trio mutant expression are similar
reductions in AMPAR-eEPSC amplitude that are consistent with
these mutants inhibiting wild-type Trio function through either
competition or degradation. Going forward, knock-in mice
heterozygous for these hypomorphic ASD-related Trio mutations
will be necessary to precisely identify ASD-related behavioral
phenotypes
that
arise
when
Trio
function
is
potentially
in-between what occurs in Trio knockout mice and mice with a
single TRIO allele. These mice will also be very useful in exam-
ining the impact ASD-related Trio mutations have on synaptic
function at different time points in development, and may aid in
identifying novel ways in which these mutations impact gluta-
matergic synapse function. For example, Trio’s recent implication
in neurotransmitter release at the Drosophila neuromuscular
junction now justifies an investigation into possible presynaptic
roles for Trio at mammalian synapses42.
In this study, we also identify a hypermorphic missense
mutation in Trio’s GEF1 domain that produces a dramatic
enhancement of Trio activity. We find that Trio-9 D1368V
expression results in an enhancement of AMPAR-mediated
transmission that is twice that produced by wild-type Trio.
Trio-9 D1368V also results in a substantial enhancement of
NMDAR-mediated currents, which are not affected by wild-type
Trio. CV and dendritic spine analysis identify an increase in the
number of functional synapses as being responsible for this
observed increase in glutamatergic neurotransmission. This find-
ing is akin to reports of increased glutamatergic neurotransmis-
sion in several animal models of ASD/ID and observed increases
in the number of glutamatergic synapses in a number of indivi-
duals with ASD17, 18, 43. Interestingly, this mutation is the only
ASD-related mutation identified in our study that was predicted to
not directly influence Trio’s ability to activate Rac1. Furthermore,
this residue is highly exposed to solvent on a region of the GEF1/
DH1 subdomain that is pointing away from the interface with
Rac1. One possibility is that D1368V destabilizes autoinhibitory
interactions that occur in Trio. Such intramolecular interactions

 have been proposed for Kalirin and other RhoGEFs44, 45. Another
possibility is that this site is involved in the binding of allosteric
inhibitors of GEF domains. TRIOBP, for example, has been shown
to bind directly to Trio’s GEF1 domain and inhibit the ability
of
Trio
to
activate
Rac146.
Alternatively,
it
is
possible
that
this
mutation
increases
Trio
expression
levels
(e.g., through disruption of an E3 ligase binding substrate).
Additional study will be needed to elucidate the mechanism by
which this mutation results in enhanced Trio function.
Disruptions in synaptic Rac1-mediated actin regulation have
recently been found to underlie the development of ASD-related
behavioral phenotypes in well-established animal models of
ASD-related diseases5–7. A recent study also identified Rac1 as a
likely point of convergence of a number of ASD risk genes8. Here
we identify the Rac1 activation domain of the synaptic actin reg-
ulatory protein, Trio, as a hotspot for ASD-related de novo muta-
tions. Because dysregulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission is
believed to underlie the behavioral phenotypes in many animal
models of ASD and because proteins downstream of Trio activity
have not been found to harbor substantial ASD-related mutations,
it is tempting to speculate that altered Trio function represents a
major point of convergence of a number of factors that give rise to
ASD. Going forward it will be necessary to determine the pre-
valence of altered Trio function in individuals with ASD and
establish whether Trio-related therapies can be applied to reverse
ASD-related behavioral phenotypes in appreciable numbers of
individuals with this disease.
Methods
Mutation modeling. The effect of mutations on stability and binding were
predicted using the high-resolution crystal structure of Trio GEF1 complex with
Rac1 (PDB code 2NZ8). Calculations were performed using ICM molecular
modeling software (Molsoft LLC). Energy optimization of mutant protein
conformation was performed using biased probability Monte Carlo algorithm.

Experimental constructs. Human Trio-9 (or Trio-9s in ref. 13) was generated
from a Trio-FL cDNA generously provided by Dr. Betty A. Eipper (University of
Connecticut). ASD-related Trio mutations were made from Trio-9 cDNA using
overlap-extension PCR followed by In-fusion cloning (Clontech). All plasmids
were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Trio-9 cDNAs were cloned into a pCAGGs
vector containing IRES-mCherry. A pFUGW vector expressing only GFP was
co-expressed with pCAGG-IRES-mCherry constructs to enhance identification of
transfected neurons and was used as a control vector for spine imaging. The Rac1
biosensor construct was within a pTriEx-HisMyc backbone, has been described
previously in ref. 30 and was generously provided by Dr. Jaap D. van Buul
(Sanquin).
HEK293 cell transfection. HEK293T cells (ATCC) were cultured in DMEM with
10% FBS in a 37 °C incubator supplied with 5% CO2. Cells were plated onto 35 mm
glass bottom plates coated with Matrigel. Cells were grown until 50% confluence
before being transfected with the Trio-9 expression constructs together with the
Rac1 biosensor using FuGENE HD Transfection Reagent. A Trio-9/Rac1 biosensor
DNA ratio of 1:1 was used. Plated cells were incubated in the transfection mixture
for 16 h, and then replaced with fresh media. HEK293 experiments were conducted
~20 h after transfection.
Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM). Fluorescence lifetime images were
acquired from HEK293 cells with a Zeiss LSM-780 inverted microscope coupled to a
Ti:Sapphire laser system (Coherent Chameleon Ultra II, 80 fs pulses with
repetition rate of 80 MHz) and an ISS A320 FastFLIM47, 48. A 40X 1.1 NA water
immersion objective (Zeiss Korr C-Apochromat) optimized for 2-P imaging
was used. For image acquisition, the following settings were used: image size
of 256 × 256 pixels and scan speed of 12.6 μs/pixel. A short pass dichroic filter
(760 nm) was used to separate the fluorescence signal from the laser light. For the
acquisition of FLIM images, fluorescence light was separated into donor and
acceptor fluorescence by a 509 long pass CFP/YFP filter, and then detected by two
hybrid photomultiplier tube detectors (Hamamatsu R10467U-40), one having a
CFP 483/32 and the other a YFP 537/26 band pass filter for the detection of donor
and acceptor signal, respectively. FLIM data were acquired from fields of HEK293
cells using VistaVision software from ISS Inc., and processed by the SimFCS soft-
ware developed at the Laboratory of Fluorescence Dynamics (LFD), University of
California Irvine. The FRET donor fluorophore was excited at 840 nm. An average
power of about 5 mW was used to excite the cells. Calibration of the FLIM system
was performed by measuring the known lifetime of coumarin 6 in 99% ethanol
solution, characterized by a single exponential decay time of 2.55 ns. Typically, the
acquisition time to obtain an average photon count of 100 counts/pixel was about
30 sec. Data analysis was performed using the phasor approach to biosensor FLIM-
FRET detection49. Every pixel of the FLIM image was transformed in one pixel in
the phasor plot as previously described and reported in detail50, 51. The coordinates
g and s in the phasor plot were calculated from the fluorescence-intensity decay of
each pixel of the image by using Fourier transformations. The analysis of the phasor
distribution was performed by cluster identification. We calculated the FRET effi-
ciency trajectory according to the classical definition of FRET efficiency:
E ¼ 1 � τDA=τD
ð3Þ
The phasor of the FRET biosensor in the absence of the activator was obtained
from an independent preparation. The phasor corresponding to the quenched
donor was calculated according to the quenching equation (3). The positions of all
possible phasors that are quenched with different efficiencies describe a curved
trajectory in the phasor plot. The experimental position of the phasor of a given
pixel along the trajectory determineed the amount of quenching and therefore the
FRET efficiency. The contributions of the background and of the donor without
acceptor are evaluated using the rule of the linear combination49, 52, with the
background phasor and the donor unquenched determined independently. All
phasor transformations and the data analysis of FLIM data were performed using
SimFCS software (University of California, Irvine).
Electrophysiology. All experimental procedures were carried out in accordance with
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals and approved by the University of Southern California Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee. Organotypic slice cultures were prepared from P6–9 male
and female Sprague-Dawley rat pups as described in detail in Stoppini et al., 199153.
Briefly, hippocampi were removed from P6-P9 Sprague-Dawley rats and 400 μm
transverse sections were made using a MX-TS tissue slicer (Siskiyou). Slices were
mounted on individual squares of Biopore Membrane filter roll (Millipore) and placed
on Millicell Cell Culture inserts (Millipore) in 35 mm dishes containing 1 ml of culture
media (MEM + HEPES (Gibco 12360-038), horse serum 25%, HBSS (25%) and
L-glutamine (1 mM). Media was exchanged every other day. Sparse biolistic transfec-
tions of organotypic slice cultures were performed on DIV1 as described in detail
in Schnell et al., 200254. Briefly, 50 µg total of mixed plasmid DNA was coated on
1 µm-diameter gold particles in 0.5 mM spermidine, precipitated in with 0.1 mM CaCl2,
and washed four times in pure ethanol. The gold particles were coated onto PVC
tubing, dried using ultra-pure N2 gas, and stored at 4 °C in desiccant. DNA-coated gold
particles were delivered with a Helios Gene Gun (BioRad). Construct expression was
confirmed by GFP and mCherry epifluorescence. Recordings were performed on day
in vitro (DIV) 7 slices. All slices were maintained during recording in room temperature
artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing (in mM): 119 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1
NaH2PO4, 26.2 NaHCO3, 11 glucose, 4 CaCl2 and 4 MgSO4. aCSF was supplemented
with 5 μM 2-chloroadenosine to dampen epileptiform activity, and GABAA receptors
were blocked by picrotoxin (0.1 mM). aCSF was saturated with 95% O2/5% CO2. The
internal whole-cell recording solution contained (in mM): 135 CsMeSO4, 8 NaCl, 10
HEPES, 0.3 EGTA, 5 QX-314, 4 Mg-ATP, and 0.3 Na-GTP and pH buffered at 7.3–7.4.
Osmolarity was adjusted to 290–295 mOsm.
Transfected neurons were identified by epifluorescence microscopy. All paired
recordings involved simultaneous whole-cell recordings from one transfected
neuron and a neighboring non-transfected control neuron. Synaptic responses were
evoked by stimulating with a monopolar glass electrode filled with aCSF in stratum
radiatum of CA1. The stimulus was adjusted to evoke a measurable monosynaptic
eEPSC in both cells. Synaptic responses were collected with a Multiclamp 700B
amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 10
kHz. Peak AMPAR currents were recorded at −70 mV. NMDAR currents were
measured at + 40 mV and were temporally isolated by measuring amplitudes 150 ms
following the stimulus, at which point the AMPAR-eEPSC had completely decayed.
In the scatter plots for simultaneous dual recordings, each open circle represents one
paired recording, and the closed circle represents the average of all paired
recordings. In the scatter plot, the x-axis represents the eEPSC recorded in the
control cell, and the y axis represents the eEPSC recorded in the transfected cell.
Virtual 1:1 diagonal line is also shown. If the data point falls below the diagonal line,
it indicates that the eEPSC is higher in the control cell. Paired-pulse ratio was
determined by delivering two stimuli at 40 ms apart and dividing the peak response
of stimulus 2 by the peak response to stimulus 1. Series resistance was monitored
and not compensated, and neurons in which series resistance varied by 25% during
a recording session were discarded. No more than one paired recording was
performed on a given slice. Data was collected and analyzed using in-house software
in Igor Pro (Wavemetrics) developed in Dr. Roger Nicoll’s laboratory at UCSF.
Spine density analysis. For spine density analysis, control and experimental CA1
pyramidal neurons in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures made from P6 rat pups
were biolistically transfected with FUGW-GFP and pCAGGS-IRES-mCherry
constructs approximately 18–20 h after plating. Images were acquired at DIV 7 using
super-resolution microscopy (Elyra Microscope System, Zeiss). For use with the
available inverted microscope and oil-immersion objective lens, slices were fixed in 4%
PFA/4% sucrose in PBS and washed 3× with PBS. To amplify the GFP signal, slices
were then blocked and permeabalized in 3% BSA in PBS containing 0.1% Triton-X
and stained with primary antibody against GFP (2 μg/ml, Life Technologies A-11122)
followed by washes in PBSTx and staining with Alexa 488-conjugated secondary
(4 μg/ml, Life Technologies A-11034). Slices were further processed with an abbre-
viated SeeDB-based protocol55 in an attempt to reduce spherical aberration. Slices were
then mounted in SlowFade Gold (Life Technologies) for imaging. Z-stacks were made
of 30 µm sections of secondary apical dendrites ~30 µm from the soma. Images were
acquired with a 100× oil objective (100×/1.46) in SIM mode using a supplied 42 μm
SIM grating and processed and reconstructed using supplied software (Zen, Zeiss).
An experimenter, blinded to the condition of the image, performed image analysis on
individual sections using ImageJ to count spines extending laterally from the dendrite.
Statistics analysis. For the ASD-related mutation statistics in Trio, we used a
simple Poisson test, similar to the one used in Samocha et al.29. The expected
number of de novo mutations in Trio protein in 4890 individuals with ASD-related
disorders was calculated based on gene-specific mutation probability as determined
by Samocha et al. Expected number of de novo mutations in the Trio-GEF1/DH1
domain was estimated through rescaling of expected number of mutations in Trio
with assumption of equal mutation probability along the gene. A genome-wide
significance threshold P-value of < 1 × 10−6 was used. For paired electro-
physiological recordings of eEPSC amplitude, a Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test for
paired data was used. Wilcoxon Rank Sum Tests were used to compare
electrophysiological data across independent conditions. Paired pulse facilitation
measurements and spine density data were analyzed using a paired and unpaired
Student’s t-test, respectively. All statistical tests performed were two-sided and with
all tests a P-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All error bars
represent standard error measurement. Sample sizes in the present study are
similar to those reported in the literature.
