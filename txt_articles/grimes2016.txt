New NICE referral guidance for oral cancer: does it risk
delay in diagnosis?

Abstract
Changes to guidance about the two-week wait referrals for suspected cancer of the head and neck have created a new recommendation for
a general medical practitioner to refer any patients to a dentist under certain criteria. The potential effect of this was assessed based on 91
referrals to an oral and maxillofacial unit. A total of 33 met the criteria for initial referral to a dentist; of these, one was later diagnosed with
cancer. We outline the potential deleterious effects the new guidance might have on the rapid diagnosis of oral lesions.

Introduction
Since the introduction of the two-week wait referral pathway
for suspected cancer in 2000, diagnosis of lesions in the head
and neck has beenbelow10%.1 TheupdatedNICEguidelines
(NG12, 2015)2 imply that certain presentations, if identified
by a GP, should be referred to a dentist for assessment before
they are reviewed by a specialist. We compared the applica-
tion of the new advice against that given in the old guidelines
(CG27, 2005)3 on a group of patients referred to an oral and
maxillofacial department to assess the potential impact on
outcomes.
Method
We made a retrospective audit of all two-week referrals
received between July and August 2014; this included an

assessment of referral letters, medical notes, and histologi-
cal results. The outcome measures were, the number of those
referrals that met the CG27 and NG12 criteria, and the num-
ber diagnosed with cancer. The time taken to be seen, the
quality of the referral letter, all clinical and histological find-
ings, and the final diagnosis were also assessed.
Results
A total of 91 referrals were included (52 men and 39 women).
Thirty-three met CG27 referral criteria, 33 met NG12 referral
criteria, and 25 met both criteria, (Tables 1 and 2). Six of the
referred patients were subsequently diagnosed with cancer.
All of them met both CG27 and NG12 criteria. Nine referrals
met criteria in NG12 guidance that recommended an initial
referral to a dentist and of these, one was subsequently diag-
nosed with cancer. Four referrals reported a lump consistent
with oral cancer, although none of these was malignant. The
remainder of referrals that would require initial referral to a
dentist had either red or white patches, or both. The propor-
tion of referrals from dentists that met the criteria increased
from 6 (CG27) to 12 (NG12) largely as a result of a change

no longer suggest that such lesions should be accompanied
by pain, or bleeding or swelling, or both, for a referral for
suspected cancer).
Discussion
The same number of referrals met both CG27 and NG12 guid-
ance. Nine from this group would have required GP referral
to a dentist under NG12 guidance. Assuming dentists do not
refer all these patients on to the two-week wait pathway this
could reduce the burden placed on the service. Also in support
of this approach, Tikka et al4 concluded that red and white
patches are a poor predictor of cancer with a predictive value
of 4% (although this exceeds the >3% target set by NICE
guidance), but that oral swelling is an important indicator
of potential cancer. However, NG12 guidance may expose
patients to increased risk of delayed referral because there
is no clear referral pathway between doctors and dentists for
suspected cancer. If the population was reflected by our find-
ings, 1 in 9 patients would have their diagnoses delayed, but
a larger sample size will be necessary to establish this.
It should be remembered that only 55.7% of the adult
population of England were seen by an NHS dentist in the
previous two years as recorded between 2014 and 2015.5
Reports on the time it takes to gain access to a dentist are
lacking but 7% of patients were unsuccessful in making an
appointment with an NHS dentist.6 There is no guidance on
appropriate referral in the event that a patient does not have
a dentist. Data suggest that men, people who are are older,
or have lower socioeconomic status are least likely to use
primary dental care services,6 which are the same groups
at greatest risk of developing oral cancer.7 Our data com-
bined with the epidemiological evidence, the lack of access
to primary dental care, and a quality-assessed referral path-
way between providers of primary care means the current
guidance has the potential for more delays than the one it has
replaced.
