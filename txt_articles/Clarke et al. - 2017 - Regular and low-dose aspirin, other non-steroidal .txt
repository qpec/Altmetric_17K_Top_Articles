Abstract
Background: Regular users of aspirin may have reduced risk of breast cancer. Few studies have addressed whether
risk reduction pertains to specific breast cancer subtypes defined jointly by hormone receptor (estrogen and
progesterone receptor) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression. This study assessed the
prospective risk of breast cancer (overall and by subtype) according to use of aspirin and other non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) in a cohort of female public school professionals in California.
Methods: In 1995 − 1996, participants in the California Teachers Study completed a baseline questionnaire on
family history of cancer and other conditions, use of NSAIDs, menstrual and reproductive history, self-reported
weight and height, living environment, diet, alcohol use, and physical activity. In 2005–2006, 57,164 participants
provided some updated information, including use of NSAIDs and 1457 of these participants developed invasive
breast cancer before January 2013. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models provided hazard
rate ratios (HRR) for the association between NSAID use and risk of invasive breast cancer as well as hormone
receptor- and HER2-defined subtypes.
Results: Developing breast cancer was associated inversely with taking three or more tablets of low-dose aspirin
per week (23% of participants). Among women reporting this exposure, the HRR was 0.84 (95% confidence
interval (CI) 0.72–0.98) compared to those not taking NSAIDs and this was particularly evident in women with the
hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative subtype (HRR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.66–0.96). Use of three or more tablets of
“other” NSAIDs was marginally associated with lower risk of breast cancer (HRR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.62–1.00). Other
associations with NSAIDs were generally null.
Conclusion: Our observation of reduced risk of breast cancer, among participants who took three or more
tablets of low-dose aspirin weekly, is consistent with other reports looking at aspirin without differentiation by
dose. This is the first report to suggest that the reduction in risk occurs for low-dose aspirin and not for regular-
dose aspirin and only among women with the hormone receptor-positive/HER2-negative subtype. This
preliminary study builds on previous knowledge and further supports the need for formal cancer
chemoprevention studies of low-dose aspirin.

 Background
Daily use of low-dose (81 mg) aspirin is formally recom-
mended by the United States Preventive Services Task
Force (USPSTF) for broad chemoprevention of cardio-
vascular disease [1] and colorectal cancer [2]. Regular-
dose aspirin may also provide effective chemoprevention
of breast cancer in women, although the evidence is
mixed. In one clinical trial in which women were ran-
domized to receive 100 mg of aspirin or placebo every
other day, no reduction in breast cancer risk was ob-
served among women receiving aspirin [3]. However, a
meta-analysis published in 2008, which included 38
studies and over 2 million women, concluded that breast
cancer risk overall was reduced in association with use
of any aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs) [4]. In contrast, in a more recent
assessment of 32 studies the authors concluded that
aspirin use was not associated with risk of breast
cancer, although a statistically significant reduction in
the
risk
of
hormone
receptor
(HR)-positive
sub-
types was noted [5]. Both of these meta-analyses
detected substantial heterogeneity of results among
studies [4, 5]. One contributor to this heterogeneity
may be variation in associations by breast cancer sub-
type, defined jointly by HR and HER-2/neu receptor
(HER2) status. Tumor expression of these markers
strongly influences clinical care (e.g., treatment with
tamoxifen or trastuzumab) and is also associated with
marked differences in incidence patterns and risk
factors [6–9]. It is possible that NSAIDs differentially
influence the development of tumors based on the
expression of HR and HER2. Heterogeneity in the
results for aspirin may also be explained by previous
studies not distinguishing between low-dose or daily
aspirin use, which are common patterns of NSAID
use that may be misclassified in broader categoriza-
tions, such as all doses of aspirin combined or use of
three or more tablets per week.
To date, one prospective and two case-control studies
have examined detailed use of NSAIDs and risk of breast
cancer subtypes defined jointly by HR and HER2 status.
The Nurses’ Health Study reported that use of two or
more tablets of any dose of aspirin per week was statisti-
cally significantly associated with the risk of the luminal
A (HR-positive/HER2-negative) subtype but not associ-
ated with the luminal B subtype (HR-positive/HER2-
positive),
indicating
the
importance
of
categorizing
HER2 in detail [10]. In the two case-control studies any
aspirin use was statistically significantly associated with
reductions in risk of all four breast cancer subtypes stud-
ied [11, 12] and one of these studies further suggested
that reductions in risk were limited to overweight
women [12], in whom adipose-related inflammation
might be higher.
To add to the evidence on low-dose aspirin, other
NSAIDs including regular dose aspirin (defined as
325 mg), and the risk of HR and HER2-defined breast
cancer subtypes, we looked to our long-term prospect-
ive cohort of California public school professionals who
were asked in 2005–2006 about current use of pain-
relieving
medications,
including
low-dose
aspirin,
regular-dose aspirin, ibuprofen, and other NSAIDs. A
prior analysis of NSAIDS and breast cancer in this co-
hort [13] was based on earlier questionnaire data that
did not differentiate between low-dose and regular-dose
aspirin. With over 7 years of follow up of incident
breast cancer (n = 1457) including crucial detail on
tumor HER2 status since submission of the 2005–2006
questionnaire, we evaluated whether risk of breast can-
cer varied by recent use of NSAIDs, and explored
whether any associations between NSAIDs and risk of
breast cancer were modified by HER2-defined breast
cancer subtypes or overweight status.
Methods
The California Teachers Study cohort (CTS) was estab-
lished in 1995–1996 when 133,479 active and retired
female teachers, administrators and other public school
professionals were recruited through the California State
Teachers Retirement System [14]. Participants com-
pleted a baseline questionnaire that collected informa-
tion on family history of cancer and other conditions,
menstrual and reproductive history, self-reported weight
and height, living environment, diet, alcohol and tobacco
use, physical activity history, and frequency and duration
of prior use of certain medications including aspirin (but
without detail on aspirin dose).
In 2005–2006, a 10-year follow-up questionnaire col-
lected updated information on frequency of current use
of aspirin, low-dose aspirin and other pain-relieving
medications (see below), weight, alcohol use, meno-
pausal status, use of hormone therapy (HT), and phys-
ical activity. Copies of questionnaires are available at
https://www.calteachersstudy.com/past-questionnaires.
The CTS is overseen by the Institutional Review Boards
of the Cancer Prevention Institute of California, the
California Health and Human Services Agency, the Uni-
versity of California, Irvine, the University of Southern
California, and the City of Hope.
CTS participants are followed annually for changes of
address, cancer diagnoses, hospitalizations, outpatient
surgeries, emergency room visits, and death. Annual
linkage with the California Cancer Registry (CCR) is
used to identify incident cancer among cohort members.
The CCR is a population-based cancer registry, which is
anchored in state legislation that mandates reporting
and is estimated to be over 99% complete [15]. Annual
linkages with the Office of Statewide Health Planning
Clarke et al. Breast Cancer Research  (2017) 19:52 
Page 2 of 12
 and Development (OSHPD) allow us to identify details
of each members’ hospitalizations, outpatient surgeries,
and emergency room visits. California and national mor-
tality files are used to ascertain dates and causes of
death.
Breast cancer ascertainment
Information on all incident breast cancers was obtained
from the CCR, including pathologic and clinical features,
which are abstracted directly from the medical record.
HR status was based on estrogen receptor (ER) and pro-
gesterone receptor (PR) status as routinely reported on
diagnostic pathology records. HER2 status was also
based on pathology report review. Subtypes were defined
as follows: HR-positive/HER2-negative was defined as
ER-positive or PR-positive and HER2-negative; HR-
positive/HER2-positive was defined as ER-positive or
PR-positive and HER2-positive; HR-negative/HER2-posi-
tive was defined as ER-negative and PR-negative and
HER2-positive; and triple-negative was defined as ER-
negative, PR-negative, and HER2-negative.
Assessment of pain-relieving medications
On the 10-year follow-up questionnaire, women were
asked whether they were currently taking any pain-
relieving medications at least once a week, and if yes,
the total number of tablets taken per week (1–2, 3–4,
5–6, 7–8, 9–10, 11–12, 13–14, 15–21, 22–28, or 29+
tablets per week). The medication choices included
low-dose aspirin; aspirin or aspirin-containing product
(Bayer, Bufferin, Excedrin); ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin);
naproxen, ketoprofen or other non-steroidal (Aleve,
Feldene, Indocin, Naprosyn, Orudis, Relafen); Cox-2
inhibitors (Celebrex, Vioxx); and acetaminophen (as-
pirin-free Excedrin, Tylenol, Tempra). Women were
then asked if they had stopped regular use of any of
these medications during the past 3 years, and if yes,
why (by marking any of the following response categor-
ies that applied: “Condition improved", "Didn’t work", “I
had side effects", “I heard about side effects", "Drug no
longer available", “Other”). The baseline questionnaire
asked if aspirin (Anacin, Bufferin, Excedrin) and ibu-
profen (Advil, Motrin, Nuprin) were taken regularly (at
least once a week), total years taken and how many
days per week taken (1-3 days/week, 4-6 days/week or
daily).
Each medication type from the 10-year questionnaire
was initially categorized as “Never in the past 3 years",
“Former", “Current" ,or “Unknown” for that type of
medication. Women were classified into the category
“Never in the past 3 years” if they reported: (1) current
use of 0 or <1 medication per week or left this question
blank; (2) never took the medication regularly or did not
stop regular use or left this question blank; and (3) did
not give a reason for stopping. “Current” users were
those who reported: (1) current use of ≥1 tablet(s) per
week; (2) “Never took regularly or did not stop use” or
left this question blank; and (3) did not give a reason for
stopping. “Former” users were those who reported: (1)
“Yes, I stopped regular use” or gave a reason for stop-
ping; and (2) reported current use as 0 or <1 medication
per week or left this question blank. All other women,
including those whose answers were inconsistent or who
left both questions blank for all medications, were classi-
fied as “Unknown”.
For analysis, we: (1) focused on the five NSAIDs from
the 10-year questionnaire, excluding acetaminophen; (2)
grouped the women who were in the category of “Never
in the past 3 years” for the medication of interest into
women who reported (a) “No NSAIDs in the past
3 years,” which was used as the reference group, (b) no
use of that particular type of medication but had used
one or more of the other four NSAIDs in the past
3 years, and (c) no use of that particular type of medica-
tion and unknown use of one or more of the other four
NSAIDS, which was combined with the “Unknown”
category; and (3) combined former and current users of
1–2 tablets per week into one category. For low-dose
aspirin, we also examined “Daily” use, which was defined
as those with current use of 7+ tablets per week
(Table 2).
Study population
For the present analyses, we excluded women sequen-
tially who at baseline were not residing in California (n
= 8867), had a prior history of breast cancer (n = 6216),
or had unknown cancer history (n = 135). We also ex-
cluded women who prior to the 10-year follow-up ques-
tionnaire had died (n = 8654), had requested no further
contact from the CTS (n = 926), had moved out of
California for more than 4 months (n = 8296), had devel-
oped breast cancer (n = 4188), or had a bilateral mastec-
tomy without a diagnosis of breast cancer (identified
from hospital discharge
data)
(n = 18). Among the
remaining 96,179 participants, 57,164 (59%) completed
the 10-year follow-up questionnaire. During follow up
(from the date a woman completed the 2005–2006 ques-
tionnaire and continuing through 31 December 2012),
1457 women were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer
after completing the 10-year follow-up questionnaire.
Data analysis
Follow-up time was calculated as the number of days be-
tween the date the 10-year follow-up questionnaire was
completed and the first of the following events: a first
diagnosis of breast cancer (International Classification of
Diseases for Oncology-3 (ICD-O-3) site code C50) (n =
1457 with invasive cancer; n = 393 in situ cancer), death
Clarke et al. Breast Cancer Research  (2017) 19:52 
Page 3 of 12
 (n = 3538), a move (for >4 months) out of California (n
= 2082), bilateral mastectomy (n = 5), or 31 December
2012 (n = 49,689).
Hazard rate ratios (HRR) and 95% CI were estimated
using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regres-
sion models, with age (in days) as the time metric and
stratification by age (in years) at the time of the 10-year
follow-up
questionnaire.
Covariates
were
included
based on their independent association with risk for a
given outcome with a p value <0.05 in multivariable
models.
Competing risk analysis was used to estimate risk of
invasive breast cancer overall and by different receptor
subtypes. The 157 women diagnosed with breast cancer
during follow up who had missing information on HR or
HER2 status were excluded from all models with breast
cancer subtype as the outcome. We tested the propor-
tional hazards assumption for each covariate in the
model and for the main effect for the different outcomes
using a likelihood ratio test of interaction with the time
metric (continuous age) based on cross-product terms.
We found only one violation of the proportional hazards
assumption: alcohol consumption had a statistically sig-
nificant interaction with time-dependent age for HR-
negative/HER2-negative tumors; thus, this interaction
was included in the model for that outcome.
We conducted multivariable analyses in which we
assessed
the
impact
of
adjusting
for
history
of
hospitalization for myocardial infarction (between 1991
and the date the 10-year follow-up questionnaire was
completed based on ICD-9 diagnostic codes 410.00-
410.92 from OSHPD linkage; no, yes) and history of dia-
betes mellitus (from the 10-year follow-up questionnaire;
no, yes, missing). These adjustments did not meaning-
fully change the HRR when evaluating the association of
current use of low-dose aspirin with risk of breast can-
cer overall or with risk of any of the receptor subtypes.
Hence, history of myocardial infarction and history of
diabetes mellitus were not included in the final models
presented here. We also examined models of low-dose
aspirin stratified by body mass index (BMI) (<25 or
≥25 kg/m2) and tested the interaction using a likelihood
ratio test and cross-product terms, excluding women
with unknown NSAID use.
In a secondary analysis, we considered aspirin use at
baseline (regular-dose and low-dose aspirin were not
asked about separately) in conjunction with use of
regular-dose and low-dose aspirin from the 10-year
questionnaire, with no NSAID use reported at both
baseline (including aspirin and ibuprofen) and the 10-
year follow-up (including regular-dose and low-dose
aspirin,
ibuprofen,
Cox-2
inhibitors,
and
other
NSAIDs) as the reference group. This analysis was
limited to outcomes of breast cancer and the HR-
positive/HER2-negative subtype, as we had an insuffi-
cient number of diagnoses to examine these associa-
tions in the other subtypes.
Results
The 1457 cases of invasive breast cancer diagnosed dur-
ing follow up included 998 (68%) HR-positive/HER2-
negative, 120 (8%) HR-positive/HER2-positive, 44 (3%)
HR-negative/HER2-positive, 138 (9%) HR-negative/HER2-
negative breast cancers, and 157 (11%) with missing data
on expression status for at least one receptor. The charac-
teristics of cohort participants are shown in Table 1: the
majority of participants (88%) were of non-Hispanic, white
ethnicity and the median age at the time of the 10-year
follow-up survey was 61 years (interquartile range 54–71
years). Participants had a relatively high prevalence of
some of the established risk factors for breast cancer, with
20% reporting current use of HT and 15% reporting
current consumption of ≥20 g of alcohol per day.
The most common NSAID reported as currently used
by participants at the 10-year follow-up was low-dose
aspirin (Table 1); 23% of women reported current use of
at least three low-dose aspirin tablets per week. Ibupro-
fen was the second most common pain-relieving medi-
cation used, with 18% of participants reporting use of at
least three tablets per week. Use of at least three regular-
dose (325 mg) aspirin tablets per week was reported by
11% of the CTS participants. Less than 10% of partici-
pants reported current use of other NSAIDs or COX-2
inhibitors.
Current use of at least three tablets per week of any
NSAID was not statistically significantly associated with
any particular subtype of breast cancer or breast cancer
overall (Table 2). However, when low-dose aspirin was
considered separately, current use of three or more tab-
lets per week of low-dose aspirin was statistically signifi-
cantly associated with risk of breast cancer overall (HRR
= 0.84, 95% CI 0.72–0.98 compared to those not taking
any NSAIDS); this association was observed only for the
HR-positive/HER2-negative subtype (HRR = 0.80, 95%
CI 0.66–0.96). Considering more granular categories of
frequency of low-dose aspirin use, relative to women
who had not used any NSAID in the past 3 years, an in-
verse association with breast cancer risk was observed
among women using 3–6 tablets per week (HRR =
0.72, 95% CI 0.54–0.96) and a marginal association
was observed among those using 7+ tablets per week
(HRR = 0.87, 95% CI 0.74–1.02). A similar pattern of
inverse association was observed for the HR-positive/
HER2-negative breast cancer subtype (for 3–6 tablets/
week, HRR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.47–0.94; for 7+ tablets/
week, HRR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.68–1.01, data not shown).
We also observed a lower risk of breast cancer among
women who reported current use of “other” NSAIDs

 (HRR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.62–1.00). Risk of HR-positive/
HER2-positive tumors was increased in those with un-
known use of ibuprofen, Cox-2 inhibitors, and “other”
NSAIDs, but was based on a small number of cases (n
= 13). Significant associations did not appear to differ
by overweight status (p interaction = 0.18 for low-dose
aspirin and all subtypes of breast cancer.)
To assess associations with risk of breast cancer over-
all and with risk of one subtype among probable long-
term users of NSAIDs, we carried out secondary ana-
lyses combining information reported on the baseline
and 10-year follow-up questionnaires. Among women
currently using 3+ low-dose aspirin tablets per week at
the 10-year follow up, risk of breast cancer was compar-
able between those who reported no NSAID use at base-
line (HRR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.66–0.95, 181 cases) and
those who reported using aspirin regularly for 4+ days
per week at baseline (HRR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.59–1.08, 50
cases) compared to those who reported no NSAID use
on both the baseline questionnaire and the 10-year
follow-up questionnaire (409 cases). Results were similar
for those currently using 3+ tablets per week of regular-
dose aspirin at the 10-year follow-up (HRR = 0.92, 95%
CI 0.70–1.20 (67 cases) for no NSAID use at baseline;
HRR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.67–1.31 (39 cases) for aspirin 4+
days per week at baseline). Similar patterns were ob-
served for the HR-positive/HER2-negative subtype (data
not shown).
To assess possible confounding by indication, we also
assessed associations between breast cancer and acet-
aminophen, a pain reliever that is not an NSAID.
Current use of at least 3 tablets per week of acetamino-
phen was not associated with breast cancer or any par-
ticular subtype of breast cancer in models adjusted for
the five NSAIDS (for breast cancer, HRR = 1.00, 95% CI
0.87–1.15 for current use of 3+ tablets per week of acet-
aminophen (264 cases) compared to no use of acet-
aminophen in the last 3 years (1109 cases); for the HR-
positive/HER2-negative subtype, HRR = 0.98, 95% CI
0.83–1.16 for current use of 3+ tablets per week (180
cases) compared to no use of acetaminophen in the last
3 years (757 cases); other data not shown).
Discussion
Among CTS participants who reported their detailed,
current use of NSAIDs and then were followed prospect-
ively for a median of 7 years, the association between
use of specific NSAIDs and the development of invasive
breast cancer or its receptor-defined subtypes differed
depending on the NSAID used. In the 23% of women

 observed between NSAID use and risk of breast cancer
overall. This association persisted after consideration of
other breast cancer risk factors including use of HT and
prior history of myocardial infarction. This association is
intriguing because no such association was observed
with the use of regular-dose aspirin (325 mg). We sus-
pect that this could relate to the more regular use of
low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection, as opposed to a
more sporadic pattern of use of regular-dose aspirin to
relieve pain. We did not observe any apparent modifica-
tion of the low-dose aspirin effect by overweight status,
nor did we observe stronger associations in women who
were likely to be longer-term users, having reported
using aspirin 10 years earlier, at baseline. This associ-
ation should be re-examined in cohorts with larger num-
bers of incident breast cancers in which HR and HER2
status are recorded.
The three studies published previously that assessed
HR-defined and HER-2-defined subtypes differed in the
definitions of medication dose and duration of use, limit-
ing our ability to compare the results of those studies to
ours. The Nurses’ Health Study [10] conducted the most
comprehensive assessment of NSAID use in relation to
receptor-defined subtypes, finding no association be-
tween breast cancer and use of non-aspirin NSAIDs or
acetaminophen. They defined regular users of aspirin as
those using two or more reduced tablets per week, but
did not distinguish low-dose from regular-dose formula-
tions. Across the four HR/HER2-defined subtypes, the
analyses of which were based on fewer cases than in the
present study, statistically significant protective effects
against HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer were
detected (n = 341 cases), regardless of the duration of re-
ported use (10+ years of use: relative risk (RR) = 0.66,
95% CI 0.49–0.89, fewer than 10 years of use: RR = 0.75,
95% CI 0.58–0.96). They did not observe any association
with
the
HR-positive/HER2-positive
subtype
(n = 74
cases, 10+ years of use: RR = 1.47, 95% CI 0.76–2.82;
fewer than 10 years of use: RR = 1.40, 95% CI 0.79–2.51)
or for the receptor-negative subtypes (n = 174 cases), or
for breast cancer overall [16, 17]. This pattern of associ-
ation is similar to what we have shown here for CTS
participants.
In the Nashville Breast Health Study [12], a case-
control study, the authors reported statistically signifi-
cant protective effects of regular use of any NSAID
against the risk of all receptor-defined subtypes, with a
reduced odds ratio (OR) for HR-positive/HER2-negative
cancer (OR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.56–0.88) similar to the HRR
reported here; this was limited to overweight women
with BMI of at least 25 kg/m2 [12]. Our results did not
suggest an interaction with overweight status. In the
Western New York Exposures and Breast Cancer Study
[11], another case-control study, the authors reported a
statistically significant reduction in risk of breast cancer
overall associated with aspirin use, which did not persist
for any subtype examined, including the four receptor-
defined subtypes.
Our key finding is related to low-dose aspirin and not
to regular-dose aspirin. Women who reported using
low-dose aspirin were more likely to take it more than
three times per week or daily, possibly for cardiovascular
disease prevention. In our prior analysis of NSAID use
reported at baseline by CTS participants and develop-
ment of subsequent breast cancer [18], we could not dis-
tinguish between low-dose and regular-dose aspirin as
we did not inquire about dose in the baseline question-
naire. In that analysis we found no association between
use of aspirin or ibuprofen more than once weekly and
risk of breast cancer overall, but risk of HR-negative
breast cancer was increased with 5 or more years of
daily aspirin use (RR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.12–2.92) [18]. In
the current assessment, we did not see any association
between breast cancer and use of regular-dose aspirin,
nor did we detect any significant increase in risk of any
breast cancer subtype with any aspirin use, regardless of
dose. Our assessment of probable long-term users
(women who used aspirin at baseline and at the 10-year
follow-up) showed that these women had a similar risk
of breast cancer overall and of the HR-positive/HER2-

 negative subtype as those who reported current use at
the 10-year follow-up.
Our finding of an inverse association between use of
3+ low-dose aspirin tablets/week and risk of breast can-
cer overall is consistent with the findings of several
other observational studies that did not separately
examine HR-defined and HER2-defined subtypes. The
largest and most detailed prospective study, the VITAL
cohort [19], found that women taking 81 mg low-dose
aspirin for ≥4 days per week had a more pronounced
reduction in risk of breast cancer overall (HRR = 0.65,
95% CI 0.43–0.97) after 10 years of follow up [20] than
we observed here. The results from a large prospective
study using the UK General Practice Database [21]
showed a statistically significant decreased risk of
breast cancer among women who took low-dose aspirin
daily for at least 1 year (OR = 0.67, 95% CI 0.51–0.89),
suggesting only a short duration of use was needed for
a reduction in risk to become apparent.
In contrast to these studies, in the Women’s Health
Initiative observational study [22] risk of breast cancer
overall was reduced 21% in women who took regular-
dose aspirin but not in women who took low-dose as-
pirin. Our findings are not consistent with the Women’s
Health Study, a randomized clinical trial of the use of
low-dose (100 mg) aspirin every other day, a frequency
that would have mapped to the low end of our category
defining regular use as at least three tablets weekly. After
10 years, the risk of breast cancer overall was unchanged
(RR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.97–1.09, p = 0.68) [3] among the
women randomized to low-dose aspirin. In a later sub-
analysis the investigators reported no association accord-
ing to breast tumor characteristics such as size, hist-
ology, grade, or differentiation [17]. Altogether, these
studies support the notion that use of low-dose aspirin
at least three times per week, or perhaps daily, modestly
reduces overall breast cancer risk by about 20–25%. Our
results add to this evidence base, suggesting that the re-
duction in risk occurs mainly in the HR-positive/HER2-
negative subtype.
The biological mechanism by which low-dose aspirin
could function as a chemopreventive agent against HR-
positive/HER2-negative breast cancer, but not other
breast cancer subtypes, is not yet clear. A consistent
lowering of COX-2 and prostaglandin activity could pre-
vent or slow carcinogenesis in a number of ways, at the
tumor level, by interfering with DNA adduct formation
[23], inhibiting tumor angiogenesis [4, 24, 25], or pro-
moting apoptosis [26]. Recent data examining serum cir-
culating inflammatory markers among healthy subjects
ages 55–74 years did not indicate that regular-dose
aspirin use is associated with any of 78 circulating
markers, calling into question the relevance of circulat-
ing levels of immune markers [27] and raising the
possibility of a more local immune effect. Alternatively,
as prostaglandins may upregulate production of circulat-
ing estrogens via aromatase [28, 29], daily use of low-
dose aspirin may inhibit aromatase, which could reduce
levels of key hormones and thereby impact initiation or
promotion of estrogen-sensitive tumors [18, 30, 31]. This
analysis and that from the Nurses’ Health Study [10] in-
dicated

against the risk of HR-positive tumors, but only those

COX-2 levels have been detected in triple-negative tu-
mors [32].
Strengths of this study include the complete and ac-
curate
prospective
ascertainment
of
HER2-defined
breast cancer development based on routine linkage of
the cohort to the statewide cancer registry, linkage to
hospital discharge summary data to confirm any previ-
ous myocardial infarction, and a median of 7 years of
follow up. Our study also had limitations. The total
number of breast cancer cases was greater than was
available
in
previously
published
analyses,
but
the
limited numbers available for subtype-specific analyses
meant that these were exploratory. It is possible that
women who regularly take low-dose aspirin differed
from women who did not, based on important health
parameters (other than history of myocardial infarction
or comorbid diabetes mellitus), resulting in residual and
unmeasured confounding. For instance, women who
regularly take low-dose aspirin could engage in more
health-conscious behavior than non-users or infrequent-
users. Like most observational studies, we were only able
to measure NSAID exposure as “snapshots” of exposure
at the time women completed their surveys. We were
limited in evaluating possible confounding by indication
for
cardiovascular
disease
that
did
not
result
in
hospitalization for myocardial infarction. Finally, this
population is not representative of the general popula-
tion of California women or women across the USA,
particularly with respect to educational status; thus, it is
uncertain how generalizable our findings are to the
broader population, particularly non-white women and
women born outside the USA. At cohort inception in
1996, CTS participants had incidence rates of breast
cancer that were over 50% higher than those for age-
matched and race-matched women in California [14],
which probably reflects higher prevalence of risk factors
including hormone therapy use, alcohol consumption
and particular reproductive profiles.
In summary, our study strongly supports the need for
further, perhaps experimental, study of low-dose aspirin
as a widely available, inexpensive chemopreventive op-
tion for the most common subtype of breast cancer, the
HR-positive/HER2-negative subtype. Our study adds to

pirin use and risk of breast cancer overall may be driven
by a more specific association with this hormone-
sensitive and HER2-negative breast cancer subtype. Fur-
thermore, it suggests that previously reported associa-
tions using measures that combined low-dose aspirin
use (more likely to be daily or more frequent) with regu-
lar aspirin use should reassess these associations. Future
studies of aspirin and breast cancer must be able to dis-
tinguish low-dose from other formulations and to assess
risks separately by molecularly defined subtype. Such
studies should not only detail this chemopreventive po-
tential but should also quantify any side effects associ-
ated with regular low-dose aspirin use.
Conclusions
For 23% of women who reported using low-dose aspirin
at least three times per week, we observed a modest 20%
reduction in risk of developing HR-positive/HER2-nega-
tive breast cancer, which is likely responsible for the
similar association observed for breast cancer overall.
No such association was observed for use of regular-
dose aspirin (325 mg) or other NSAIDs. We suspect that
our observations could relate to the pattern of daily use
of low-dose aspirin for prevention, as opposed to more
sporadic patterns of use to relieve pain. Our data are in-
triguing as regards the role of low-dose aspirin in breast
cancer prevention but this question should be revisited
in cohorts with larger numbers of incident breast can-
cers, in which HR and HER2 status are also recorded.
