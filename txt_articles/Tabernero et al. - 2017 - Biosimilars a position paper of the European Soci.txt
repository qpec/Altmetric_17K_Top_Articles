ABSTRACT
Biosimilars present a necessary and timely opportunity for 
physicians, patients and healthcare systems. If suitably 
developed clinically, manufactured to the correct standards 
and used appropriately, they can positively impact on the 
financial sustainability of healthcare systems. A critical 
consideration regarding the introduction of biosimilars into 
the clinic centres on the required information concerning 
all the respective procedures. This position paper aims 
to describe the issues revolving around biosimilars 
that are relevant to the field of oncology, especially the 
prescribers. More specifically, we discuss aspects related 
to definition, forms of biosimilars, labelling, extrapolation, 
interchangeability, switching, automatic substitution, 
clinical standards on safety and efficacy, responsibilities 
among prescribers and pharmacists, potential impact on 
financial burden in healthcare and the current scenario 
and future prospects of biosimilars in Europe and the rest 
of the world.
INTRODUCTION
Biological 
medicinal 
products 
form 
an integral and effective part of the 
management of non-communicable and 
communicable diseases. They are crucial to 
treating life-threatening conditions in all 
disease areas, including oncology.
With the anticancer medicines market 
set to surpass the 140 billion EUR1 mark by 
2020, healthcare decision makers are facing 
considerable challenges: tackling the issue 
of sustainability of healthcare systems and 
improving access to medicines for patients.2 
Biological medicinal products, or those whose 
active substance is made by a living organism, 
will represent 19%–20% of the total global 
share of pharmaceutical sales by 2017, and 
thus form an essential part of the anticancer 
medicines offering.3
Biosimilars (similar versions of the orig-
inator 
biologics) 
present 
a 
necessary 
opportunity for physicians, patients and 
healthcare systems. If properly developed clin-
ically, manufactured to the correct standards 
and used appropriately (with both the physi-
cian and patient being well informed), they 
can positively impact the financial sustain-
ability of healthcare systems, globally.
The European Union (EU) has been a 
pioneer in approving biosimilars, with the 
approval of 23 biosimilars up to 2016.4 Prior 
to the introduction of biosimilars for mono-
clonal antibodies (moAbs), biosimilars only 
existed for low molecular weight compounds. 
In 2013, the European Medicines Agency 
(EMA) approved two biosimilars for inflix-
imab, an moAb, a large and complex molecule 
that is widely prescribed for patients in several 
disease areas, including oncology.5 With the 
majority of moAbs coming off patent by 2020, 
the oncology landscape will be facing a lot of 
changes. The introduction of biosimilars, exis-
tence of their reference products (originator 
biologics) and creation of improved versions of 
existing biologics (biobetters), among others 
will constitute a challenging environment 
for all key stakeholders: prescribers, pharma-
cists, nurses, patients, reimbursing bodies and 
manufacturers.
To ensure that the patients are being 
prescribed the safest and most efficacious 
treatment possible, all key actors including 
the prescribers and patients will need to 
understand the complexities of biosimilars 
and take decisions that will be in the patient’s 
interests.
This paper aims to explore the issues 
surrounding biosimilars that are relevant 
to the field of oncology, especially the 
prescribers.

What are biosimilars?
Biosimilars are medicinal products containing a similar 
version of the active substance of their originator or refer-
ence product (biologic), derived from living organisms. 
They include hormones, small proteins, vaccines, fusion 
proteins and moAbs, the latter of particular relevance in 
the field of oncology.6 The registration of biosimilars in 
Europe follows complex regulatory pathways established 
by bodies such as the EMA, in line with those of their 
reference products, including preclinical and clinical 
studies as well as rigorous comparability exercises.
How are they different from generics?
The difference between biosimilars and generics is 
extremely important to understand. Generic, or small 
molecule drugs, are identical copies of their reference 
products and produced via a chemical synthesis.
When manufacturers seek the approval for a generic, 
they must establish bioequivalence tests that deem the 
two identical. Generic products do not require the addi-
tional testing requirement of clinical studies since they 
do not derive from living organisms, unlike biologics. 
With generics, the responsibility to prescribe lies with the 
physician, whereas accountability to dispense lies with 
the delivering pharmacist. Given the widespread use of 
generics, physicians are being encouraged to prescribe 
medicines using their international non-proprietary 
names (INN), as opposed to their commercial ones.
With biosimilars, due to the complexity of recreating a 
product which is made by living organisms, strict quality, 
safety and efficacy criteria need to be followed. These 
criteria include the submission of data from preclinical 
and clinical studies, among other requirements, to test 
the degree of similarity to the originator and the conse-
quent safety and efficacy of the final product. Importantly, 
due to the complexity of the process, different batches of 
a particular moAb could even be considered biosimilar 
versions of the moAb given they do not follow a purely 
chemical pathway but are made from living cells.
Thus, small molecule generics and biosimilars differ 
immensely since the latter’s requirements are similar to 
those of an originator biologic (including clinical trials 
and rigorous comparability studies).
Other forms of biosimilars
In addition to biosimilars, the lapse of patents for orig-
inal biologic products has led to the creation of multiple 
classes of biologics, in addition to biosimilars.
Non-comparable biologics are those biosimilars that do 
not meet the requirements of similarity to the original 
medicinal product since they have not been through 
the strict requirements including comparability studies 
among other requirements, as stipulated by the relevant 
bodies, such as the EMA, the World Health Organization 
(WHO) or the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Biobetters are superior products to the originator biologic 
with improved administration of the product, greater 
stability as well as other better performing indicators. 
They are consequently improved versions of the origi-
nator and may, for example, increase patient adherence 
to therapy. They are neither the originator nor their 
biosimilar, but a novel category of products.
In various regions, biosimilars are also referred to as 
‘follow-on pharmaceuticals’, subsequent entry biologics 
and biocomparables, among others.
Labelling of biosimilars
Labelling refers to the information that is displayed on the 
packaging of a product. The topic of labelling is important 
for biosimilars since both the EMA and FDA adopt the same 
approach that they apply to generic products, following 
the bioequivalence route.7 8 This implies that the informa-
tion on the label of a biosimilar should be a copy of the 
approved label of the reference product. In theory, this 
justification is valid. However, as biosimilars are not iden-
tical copies but the best possible version of their reference 
products, their labelling is of crucial importance due to the 
fact that it provides both the physician and the patient with 
the necessary information about the product and its effects.
More specifically, in the case of biosimilars for moAbs, 
the submitted information from the clinical studies, 
including detailed pharmacovigilance plans, needs to 
be reflected on the label. This is important in the field 
of oncology, as physicians should be suitably informed 
regarding (1) the patient population it was tested on (ie, 
a sensitive patient population) and (2) the sensitivity of 
endpoints used in the trial to demonstrate the efficacy of 
the biosimilar for the specific indication.
Furthermore, the correct name of the reference product 
for a biosimilar is also crucial. Since a biosimilar is not an 
identical version of its reference product, the label must 
reflect the brand name of the originator biologic, instead 
of the INN to correctly track the biosimilar and related 
adverse events. Contrary to generics that are referenced 
by their INN, the complexity of a biosimilar, including 
the recording of related adverse events, means that the 
label must specify the brand name, as recommended by 
the EMA, FDA and WHO.9–11
Thus, the label or summary of product character-
istics (SmPC) should clearly reflect the information 
concerning the product it contains and refer to the 
appropriate sections of the European Public Assessment 
Report (EPAR) that are important considerations for the 
physician. As a biosimilar is not an identical clone of the 
originator biologic, data concerning the extrapolation, 
interchangeability, switching and automatic substitution, 
immunogenicity and traceability should also be detailed 
appropriately.
Considering the complexity of biosimilars, adequate 
information is crucial to educating the physician and the 
patient to inform them about the product they will be 
administering.
Extrapolation
For prescribers, extrapolation is an extremely important 
component to the concept of biosimilarity. The EMA

defines extrapolation as ‘extending information and 
conclusions available from studies in one or more 
subgroups of the patient population (source popula-
tion)… to make inferences for another subgroup of the 
population (target population), or condition or product, 
thus reducing the need to generate additional informa-
tion… to reach conclusions for the target population …’12
As biosimilars are complex products that undergo new 
clinical studies in line with those of their reference prod-
ucts, extrapolation of the indications should be permitted 
if verified scientifically. Analytical, preclinical, pharmaco-
kinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical data, along with 
immunogenicity, should be collected if the biosimilar is 
to be correctly extrapolated to all indications of its refer-
ence product.
Thus, extrapolation to all clinical indications may be 
acceptable in the EU,13 and globally, if there are enough 
relevant data related to the safety and efficacy of the 
biosimilar, any differences in the data are appropriately 
justified.10
Interchangeability, switching and automatic substitution
Interchangeability, switching and automatic substitu-
tion are important topics in oncology. In the field of 
generics, this trio does not represent a serious concern 
since the products are identical copies of their reference 
compound. Switching a patient from the original product 
to its generic version is common practice and, due to its 
interchange, a different profile of adverse events is not 
expected.
In biosimilars, it is important for the physician to know 
if and when a product is being switched (from origi-
nator to biosimilar, biosimilar to originator or biosimilar 
to biosimilar). The decision to change or switch should 
be taken by the physician having grasped a deep under-
standing of the product (via the information on the 
SmPC and EPAR), and subsequently informing the 
patient (based on all the factual information) and closely 
monitoring the patient at all times, in collaboration with 
nursing teams. This is crucial as it will allow the physician 
and their colleagues to trace any adverse events to the 
appropriate product. Given the complexity of biosimilars, 
switching in any of the aforementioned three scenarios 
might result in different outcomes since every biologic 
is unique. In theory, although quite improbable, they 
could provoke certain immune reactions and the effec-
tiveness of a given medicine in patients may be altered if 
the product is changed during a period of treatment due 
to the differences from its reference product (immuno-
genicity).14
In the EU, interchangeability of medicines is linked to 
their substitution, which is a Member State competence.15 
However, Member States are advised to consider the 
precautionary principle as well as the potential risks asso-
ciated with substituting a reference biological medicinal 
product with a biosimilar when tendering for hospitals. 
Nine out of 28 Member States completely prohibit auto-
matic substitution of biosimilars for reference products 
by pharmacists16 17. Six out of 28 Member States restrict 
substitution to ensure the safety of patients and in partic-
ular, avoid unforeseen immune responses.16 17 There is 
no clear consensus among Member States concerning 
this issue, implying that countries may decide whether 
to implement policies related to automatic substitution 
or not.18 The EMA has not underlined any recommenda-
tions on interchangeability.19
Automatic substitution, which might be practice for 
generics, should therefore be avoided in the field of 
biosimilars. Interchangeability and switching should only 
be permitted if: (1) the physician is well-informed about 
the products; (2) the patient is fully briefed by the physi-
cian and (3) a nurse is closely monitoring the changes 
and tracking any adverse events.
Clinical standards: safety and efficacy of biosimilars
The Directive 2003/63/EC, outlining the community 
code relating to medicinal products for human use, 
states that the assessment procedure for applying for a 
marketing authorisation of a biosimilar should include 
bioequivalence and bioavailability data as well as pharma-
ceutical, chemical and biological findings.20 The addition 
of pharmaceutical, chemical and biological data differ-
entiates their requirements from ‘essential similar’ or 
generic products, and are in place to improve the safety 
and efficacy of biosimilars, or ‘similar biological medic-
inal products’.
In line with these requirements, the EMA provides 
robust guidelines for the manufacturer, including: a step-
wise approach for the design of non-clinical studies; the 
use of pharmacodynamic markers; study design, choice 
of appropriate patient population and choice of surro-
gate and clinical endpoints in efficacy trials; clinical 
safety (including design of immunogenicity studies), risk 
management plan and pharmacovigilance; extrapolation 
of safety and efficacy.21
Given the complexity of biosimilars, ensuring their 
safety and efficacy is critical. The EMA’s guidelines 
provide a comprehensive dossier that is required for 
biosimilars, including the data for immunogenicity. Clin-
ical studies are required for biosimilars to ensure that 
the manufacturing process is sound and does not differ 
from that of the originator biologic. Furthermore, EMA’s 
robust comparability study guidelines included in the 
dossier are essential to establish the safety and efficacy of 
biosimilar medicinal products.22
To appropriately capture clinical efficacy and immuno-
genic reactions, a biosimilar product should be tested in 
the most sensitive populations and its data are reported 
clearly. This will contribute to the robustness of its safety 
and efficacy and therefore build confidence in the physi-
cian and patient alike.
Lastly, once a biosimilar is on the market, contin-
uous monitoring to ensure its safety and efficacy is also 
required. Given that some side effects are only seen after 
prolonged exposure to the biosimilar and/or after a large 
number of patients are treated with a certain medicine,

additional pharmacovigilance and phase IV studies are 
essential.
Responsibilities between prescribers and pharmacists
Conventionally, a pharmacist is a professional who is quali-
fied to prepare and dispense medicinal products, whereas 
a prescriber is a professional who can select a medicinal 
product matched to specificities of a given patient. Both 
are vital in the treatment and care of patients in collab-
oration with other key professionals and healthcare 
providers.
Given that pharmacists prepare medicinal products, 
they can also switch from the original to the similar 
product, if permitted. For generic products, pharmacists 
can automatically swap from one to the other, since they 
are identical.
As biosimilars are complex and unique, pharmacists 
should not be allowed to automatically switch the biosim-
ilar without the knowledge and consent of both the 
prescriber and patient.
Prescribers should select the appropriate product 
based on sufficient data and knowledge and on informing 
the patient of the changes (original biologic to biosimilar, 
biosimilar to original, biosimilar to biosimilar). The end 
goal is to ensure the patient receives the best, safe and 
efficacious treatment available.
Impact on the financial burden
Globally, the spending on medicinal products will reach 
1.3 trillion EUR23 by 2020, with 225 new cancer treatments 
expected to be introduced by 2020. With breakthrough 
therapies in the pipeline, biosimilar medicinal products 
are particularly appealing in view of their promise to 
reduce the heavy financial burden faced by healthcare 
systems worldwide. The introduction of biosimilars is 
expected to have cumulative potential savings of 50–100 
billion EUR by 2020.24 However, the budgetary impact 
needs to be monitored.
In Europe, price reductions for biosimilars are 
expected to range from 20% to 40%, with a few cases 
being higher.24 Given that the current savings do not 
have a huge budgetary impact, the introduction of more 
biosimilars and increase in their prescription (based on 
the choice available) will impact the financial burden of 
a healthcare system.
Thus, the potential savings will have a direct correlation 
with (1) the uptake of biosimilars, (2) the negotiations 
between the Member States and manufacturers and (3) 
the increase in confidence to prescribe by the physician 
and acceptance by the patient.
Current situation in EU, Europe and ROW
The EU’s executive body, the European Commission and 
its decentralised body and the EMA have been working 
with biosimilars for the last 15 years. Since 2006, 23 biosim-
ilars have received marketing authorization in the EU.4 As 
biosimilar medicines represent a rapidly emerging field, 
the EMA has established an extensive set of guidelines,25 
which although neither binding nor mandatory, aim to 
guide the course of action and support the increasing 
number of biosimilar applications.26 Currently, no biosim-
ilars have been withdrawn from the market due to safety 
reasons; however, 1 biosimilar medicinal product was 
rejected on the basis of differences between the biosim-
ilar and its reference product (such as impurities), as well 
as stability concerns.27
In the Asia-Pacific region, over 30028 biosimilars 
(including moAbs) are currently in the pipeline, as 
compared with 5024 in the USA and EU. With the loss of 
patents, lower exclusivity periods for branded biologics 
and high costs, Asia-Pacific countries are slowly and 
gradually preparing to produce and use biosimilars. 
Countries such as Australia, Malaysia, South Korea, Japan, 
China and India already have strict regulatory standards 
for biosimilars, including guidelines.28 The WHO, with 
its guidelines, is also assisting the emerging countries, 
including those in Africa, by guiding them on biosimilars.
Globally, the next 5 years will be important for biosim-
ilars, for their uptake and their impact on healthcare 
systems.
CONCLUSION
With potential savings, a rapidly increasing range of 
biologic products and well-informed healthcare profes-
sionals and patients, biosimilars do represent one of 
the ways forward to obtain sustainability. Physicians will 
make decisions based on what is best for their patients. 
To ensure that the decision is accurate, information is 
crucial for the prescriber, pharmacist, nurse and patient. 
Collecting enough data, including findings from clinical 
studies, to instill confidence in prescribers, pharmacists 
and patients concerning the medicinal product and 
patient monitoring via expert teams will be crucial in the 
field of biosimilar medicinal products.
The manufacturing of biosimilars must also adhere to 
the stringent regulations and guidelines stipulated by the 
WHO, EMA and FDA. Medicinal products that do not 
follow the appropriate procedures and yet receive approval 
due to less stringent regulations in certain countries,29 for 
example, lack of a comparability exercise, otherwise known 
as non-comparable biologics, biomimics or intended 
copies of the originator, should not be used. Safety and 
efficacy standards are essential in biosimilars and should 
be respected by all entities manufacturing the product, 
all countries and their regulatory bodies approving the 
product, all physicians prescribing the product and all phar-
macists dispensing the product. The approved product is 
ultimately prescribed to benefit the patient, and its optimal 
safety and efficacy is, critically, the shared responsibility of 
both the manufacturers and the regulatory bodies.
