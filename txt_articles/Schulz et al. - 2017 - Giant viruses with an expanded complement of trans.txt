The discovery of giant viruses blurred the sharp division between viruses and cellular life.
Giant virus genomes encode proteins considered as signatures of cellular organisms,
particularly translation system components, prompting hypotheses that these viruses
derived from a fourth domain of cellular life. Here we report the discovery of a group of
giant viruses (Klosneuviruses) in metagenomic data. Compared with other giant viruses,
the Klosneuviruses encode an expanded translation machinery, including aminoacyl
transfer RNA synthetases with specificities for all 20 amino acids. Notwithstanding the
prevalence of translation system components, comprehensive phylogenomic analysis
of these genes indicates that Klosneuviruses did not evolve from a cellular ancestor but
rather are derived from a much smaller virus through extensive gain of host genes.
H
allmark features of giant viruses are ge-
nomes and virions sized in a range previ-
ously thought to be characteristic of cellular
life(1–3).Giantvirusgenomesencodehomo-
logs of diverse bacterial and eukaryotic
genes, including translation system components,
reigniting the debate over the origin of these vi-
ruses (4–6). It has been proposed that giant vi-
ruses constitute remnants of ancient cellular life
or are derived from an enigmatic fourth domain
of life (3, 7, 8). Alternatively, evidence of signature
cellular genes acquired from hosts implies that
these viruses evolved from much smaller viral
ancestors (6, 9, 10). Discovery of a virus encoding
translation machinery that is more complete than
in previously identified giant viruses would allow
a comprehensive phylogenetic assessment of these
signatures of cellular life to discriminate between
these two hypotheses.
Analysis of low-complexity metagenomes from
a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in Kloster-
neuburg, Austria, revealed clearly separated ge-
nomic bins comprising many genes typically found
in giant viruses. From these data, a 1.57-Mb ge-
nome of a putative virus, which we named
Klosneuvirus (KNV), was assembled (Fig. 1, fig.
S1, and table S1). The combination of distinct GC
distribution and tetranucleotide patterns, the ho-
mogenous dispersal of genes exclusively shared
with giant viruses, the nearly uniform read cover-
age (four to seven times) from a deeply sequenced
WWTP metagenome, and tight connections be-
tween the contigs through duplicated genes and
repetitive sequences provide converging lines of
evidence that no contaminant contigs were in-
cluded in the KNV genome bin (figs. S1 and S2).
Furthermore, on the basis of WWTP metatran-
scriptome data (table S2), 15% of the predicted
KNV genes were found to be expressed. Elec-
tron microscopy of the WWTP biomass revealed
~300-nm particles resembling giant icosahedral
viruses (fig. S2).
To detect viruses related to KNV, we screened
nearly 7000 environmental metagenomes and
discovered three metagenomics bins with high
assembly quality and strong overlap in gene
content (tables S1 and S3). All three bins were
identified as giant virus genomes, ranging from
0.86 Mb (Indivirus) to 1.33 Mb (Hokovirus) to
1.53 Mb (Catovirus) (Fig. 1). The pangenome of
KNV and its metagenome-derived relatives (hence-
forth Klosneuviruses) extends the giant virus
gene repertoire by nearly 2500 additional gene
families (Fig. 1). The largest gene pool overlap of
Klosneuviruses is with the Mimiviridae, with more
than 200 shared gene families, but Klosneuviruses
also show marked diversity in gene content (Fig.
1). Notably, only 12 of the 355 genes Klosneuvi-
ruses share with eukaryotes (but not with other
viruses) are found in all four Klosneuvirus genomes
(Fig. 1). These findings emphasize the dynamic
evolution of the Klosneuviruses and, under the
hypothesis that the origins and abundances of
acquired eukaryotic genes are determined by the
host lifestyle (11), imply that different Klosneuvi-
ruses infect distinct hosts (table S4).
Taxonomic classification of metagenomic 18S
ribosomal RNA genes suggests that putative hosts
of the Klosneuviruses are from the diverse protist
phylum Cercozoa, found in three of the four
metagenomes (table S4). With the exception of
a single virus isolated from the marine flagellate
Cafeteria (12), to date all giant viruses have been
recovered in cocultivation with Acanthamoeba
(13), which could not be detected together with
Klosneuviruses. These results emphasize the key
role of metagenomics in the discovery of previ-
ously unknown giant viruses independently of
their hosts (14, 15).
We mapped all genes of Klosneuviruses to
previously established families of orthologous
genes of nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses
(NCLDVs) [nucleocytoplasmic virus orthologous
genes (NCVOGs)] (16). Nearly all NCVOGs con-
served in the Mimiviridae are present in Klosneu-
viruses, which indicates completeness of the
genome bins (Fig. 2 and fig. S3). The pattern of
presence or absence of the core NCLDV genes
in Klosneuviruses mostly resembled that in Mimi-
viruses, which suggests evolutionary affinity.
Despite the overall similarity of the core gene
representation, Klosneuviruses display distinct
features, such as multiple additional paralogs of
the major capsid protein (up to 9 in KNV) and
the packaging adenosine triphosphatase (Fig. 2).
This diversification of the morphogenetic machin-
ery could lead to virion heterogeneity that might
play an important role in the virus-host arms race.
To place the Klosneuviruses in a phylogenomic
context, we selected five nearly universal NCLDV
genes as phylogenetic markers (17). Trees obtained
from a concatenated alignment of these genes
showed consistent topologies in which Klosneu-
viruses formed a strongly supported clade posi-
tioned between Cafeteria roenbergensis virus (CroV)
and the Mimiviruses (Fig. 2 and data S1). On the
basis of this strongly supported position and the
similarity of the gene repertoires with the Mimi-
viruses, combined with distinct features, we pro-
pose that Klosneuviruses are classified as a new
subfamily (provisionally denoted as Klosneuvirinae)
in the family Mimiviridae.
To characterize the evolutionary processes that
shaped the Klosneuvirus genomes, we identified
the most likely path in the evolution of giant
viruses, starting from the last common ancestor
of the Mimiviridae, a virus with a relatively small
genome, to the emergence of at least three dis-
tinct lineages: CroV, Mimiviruses, and Klosneu-
viruses (Fig. 2). We observed gene gain, exceeding
the amount of gene loss and leading to substan-
tial genome size increase, in each of these three
lineages independently. Lineage-specific gene gain is
particularly prevalent in three of the four Klosneu-
viruses (Fig. 2), resulting in divergent gene com-
plements (Figs. 1 and 2). The reconstructed viral
genome evolution follows the accordion model
in which phases of preferential gene gain and

 gene family expansion alternate with gene-loss–
dominated phases (18) (Fig. 2). Differences and
convergence among viral lineages are likely due
to adaptation of different giant viruses to dis-
tinct hosts after host switches.
Notably, KNV encodes a large set of translation
system components consisting of 25 tRNAs with
anticodons for at least 14 different amino acids,
as well as more than 40 translation-related pro-
teins, including 19 aminoacyl tRNA synthetases
(aaRSs) with distinct amino acid specificities, 11
translation initiation and elongation factors, a
peptide chain release factor, and several tRNA
modifying enzymes (Fig. 3 and table S5). This
expanded translation machinery is partially and
differentially shared with other Klosneuviruses
(table S5) but does not correlate with genome size.
The wealth of translational genes in Klosneu-
viruses by far exceeds the that in Mimiviruses,
which encode up to seven aaRSs (1).
To elucidate the origins of the translation sys-
tem components encoded by the Klosneuviruses,
we performed comprehensive phylogenomic anal-
ysis. The results demonstrate that most Klosneu-
virus aaRSs and translation factors affiliate with
diverse eukaryotes, mainly protists including uni-
cellular algae (Fig. 3 and data S1). These findings
are incompatible with the fourth domain hypoth-
esis, which predicts that phylogenetic trees of
translation system components would show giant
virus branches that are deeply positioned and
distant from branches within the eukaryotic sub-
tree, and instead imply piecemeal acquisition of
these genes by giant viruses (17). Only two aaRSs
(HisRS and GluRS) were found to branch deeply
between Archaea, Bacteria, and eukaryotes, po-
tentially due to accelerated evolution of viral genes
(10). Among the seven aaRSs encoded by both
Klosneuviruses and Mimiviruses, three (IleRS,
AsnRS, and TrpRS) are monophyletic, suggesting
early acquisition antedating the split between
Klosneuviruses and Mimiviruses. The remaining
four are polyphyletic and appear to have been
acquired independently (Fig. 3 and data S1). The
only aaRS traced to the last common ancestor of
the Mimiviridae is IleRS.
Virus-encoded translation factors and tRNA
modifying enzymes appear to have similar evo-
lutionary patterns. Monophyly with Mimiviruses
and/or CroV was apparent for just four of these
proteins [eIF-4E, eIF-2b#1, eRF-1, and tRNA(Ile)
lysidine-synthase], suggesting their presence in
the last common ancestor of the Mimiviridae
(Fig. 3 and data S1). In summary, the inferred
phylogenies of translation-related genes show a
mix of monophyly and polyphyly, both within
Klosneuviruses and between Klosneuviruses and
Mimiviruses. Despite the abundance of translation-
related genes in the Klosneuviruses, no virus has
yet been found to encode ribosomal RNA or pro-
teins, indicative of selectivity in the capture of
translation system components.
The existence of giant viruses with gene com-
plements more similar to the universal genetic
makeup of cellular life than that found in the
Mimiviruses has been predicted (3, 8). Our report
of genomes of giant viruses encoding an expanded
complement of translation system components
might appear to bring us closer to the hypothet-
ical cellular ancestor of giant viruses. However,
the observed evolutionary histories of encoded
aaRSs and translation factors are incompatible
with the hypothesis of an ancient origin from a
cellular ancestor, either a eukaryote or a member
of a fourth domain of life. Our results rather
imply piecemeal capture of eukaryotic trans-
lation machinery components and are most com-
patible with independent origins of giant viruses
from much smaller viruses (17, 19). Although the
biological underpinning of the high content of
translation-related genes in Klosneuviruses is
uncertain, the hosts of these viruses might be
particularly efficient in shutting down translation
upon virus infection, thus rendering virus-encoded
translation system components essential for viral
reproduction.
