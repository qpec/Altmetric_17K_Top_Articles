Introduction
Preterm birth (PTB) significantly accounts for neonatal morbidity 
and mortality, making PTB a major clinical, economic, and social 
concern in many parts of the world, including the United States 
(1). PTB is a syndrome culminating from many risk factors, includ-
ing genetic predisposition, infection/inflammation, environmen-
tal factors, oxidative stress, progesterone (P4) resistance, and 
extremes in maternal age (2). Surviving premature babies often 
suffer an array of serious chronic disabilities. Because of the com-
plex nature of the disease, defining the mechanisms underlying 
PTB has proven difficult.
Animal models that are genetically predisposed to develop 
spontaneous PTB are powerful tools for studying underlying mech-
anisms and developing novel treatment strategies for this multifac-
eted disease. However, most animal studies often use systemic or 
local exposure to high doses of inflammatory agents, such as LPS, 
or cytokines that induce ovarian luteolysis with a decline in blood 
P4 levels and other systemic effects, resulting in PTB and/or embry-
onic resorptions (3). However, decline in blood P4 levels, which trig-
gers parturition in mice, does not appear to occur in human partu-
rition (2, 4). We generated a unique mouse model with conditional 
uterine deletion of tumor suppressor gene p53 (Trp53fl/fl PgrCre/+ 
mice, referred to here as p53d/d mice), and we showed that uterine 
deficiency of p53 confers premature decidual senescence and elicits 
spontaneous PTB without a fall in P4 levels, thereby introducing a 
model to study human parturition (5, 6). These studies found that 
increased mTORC1 signaling caused premature decidual senes-
cence during early pregnancy, with 50% to 60% of p53d/d females 
showing spontaneous PTB with increases in COX2-derived prosta-
glandins (PGs). Rapamycin, an inhibitor for mTORC1 signaling, or 
a COX2 inhibitor, celecoxib, prevented PTB in p53d/d females (5, 6). 
PTB in these genetically predisposed mice was greatly aggravated 
with exposure to even a low dose of ultrapure LPS (10 μg) with a 
decline in P4 levels; this dose of LPS had no apparent adverse effects 
on the floxed p53 dams (p53fl/fl dams) or their fetuses. When rapamy-
cin and P4 were combined and used as a treatment, the incidence 
of PTB in p53d/d females given LPS was dramatically reduced (4). 
These results suggested that cooperative contributions from both 
the decidua and ovary are critical for parturition timing and preg-
nancy success. A similar signature of decidual senescence with 
increased mTORC1 signaling and COX2 expression was noted in 
a subset of women undergoing PTB (4). Therefore, these findings 
of heightened mTORC1 signaling and decidual aging via cellular 
senescence are likely to have a significant impact on understanding 
and treating women undergoing PTB.
The above findings piqued our interest to further explore the 
mechanism underlying parturition timing and to search for more 
clinically acceptable drugs to target decidual aging and prevent 
PTB in p53d/d females. With more than 50 years of clinical use, 
Inflammation and oxidative stress are known risk factors for preterm birth (PTB); however, the mechanisms and pathways 
that influence this condition are not fully described. Previously, we showed that mTORC1 signaling is increased in mice 
harboring a uterine-specific deletion of transformation-related protein 53 (p53d/d mice), which exhibit premature decidual 
senescence that triggers spontaneous and inflammation-induced PTB. Treatment with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin 
reduced the incidence of PTB in the p53d/d mice. Decidual senescence with heightened mTORC1 signaling is also a signature 
of human PTB. Here, we have identified an underlying mechanism for PTB and a potential therapeutic strategy for treating 
the condition. Treatment of pregnant p53d/d mice with either the antidiabetic drug metformin or the antioxidant resveratrol 
activated AMPK signaling and inhibited mTORC1 signaling in decidual cells. Both metformin and resveratrol protected against 
spontaneous and inflammation-induced PTB in p53d/d females. Using multiple approaches, we determined that p53 interacts 
with sestrins to coordinate an inverse relationship between AMPK and mTORC1 signaling that determines parturition timing. 
This signature was also observed in human decidual cells. Together, these results reveal that p53-dependent coordination 
of AMPK and mTORC1 signaling controls parturition timing and suggest that metformin and resveratrol have therapeutic 
potential to prevent PTB.

(Figure 1C). Concurrently, the number of live pups born to p53d/d 
females after treatment with Met or Rsv substantially increased 
(Figure 1D). The treatments with Met and Rsv did not appear to 
exert detrimental effects on pregnancy outcomes in littermates of 
p53fl/fl dams (Figure 1D), and no drop in P4 levels was noted in p53fl/fl 
and p53d/d mice (Supplemental Figure 1; supplemental material 
available online with this article; doi:10.1172/JCI87715DS1). The 
effective regimen and dose of Met and Rsv were determined from 
our initial pilot experiments and previous studies (17, 23). High-
er doses of Met (30–300 mg/kg BW) have been reported in prior 
metabolic studies in mice (11, 24).
Inflammation has been widely used to trigger PTB in sever-
al rodent models using doses as high as 200 μg of LPS by various 
routes of administration (3). We have shown that a low-grade 
inflammatory insult (10 μg LPS) superimposed on genetic predis-
position incurs PTB in 100% of p53d/d females. This is primarily 
due to suboptimal decidual health with a concomitant drop in P4 
levels secondary to ovarian luteolysis in p53d/d mothers. In con-
trast, p53fl/fl pregnant females showed no recognizable adverse 
effects with this low dose of LPS (4). To assess the efficacy of Met 
or Rsv in this context, LPS (10 μg/mouse) was injected i.p. in mice 
pretreated with Met or Rsv on day 16 (Figure 1, A and B). Met or 
Rsv alone could not deter the incidence of PTB in LPS-treated 
p53d/d mothers (Figure 1E). However, a single injection of P4 (1–2 
mg/mouse) given 4 hours before LPS injection in Met- or Rsv-pre-
treated p53d/d mice was able to substantially reduce the rate of PTB 
(Figure 1E). Interestingly, when P4 alone was tested, 80% of treat-
ed dams still experienced PTB, as compared with 20% and 36% in 
Met- or Rsv-pretreated p53d/d mothers, respectively, following an 
injection of P4 (Figure 1E), suggesting effective targeting of both 
decidual health and compensating ovarian luteolysis. The number 
of live pups born also significantly increased in Met- or Rsv-pre-
treated mice with P4 prior to an LPS injection (15% vs. 57% and 
32%, respectively) in p53d/d mothers (Figure 1F). P4 injection alone 
showed some adverse effects on pup viability in LPS-treated p53fl/fl 
females (Figure 1F); this is not surprising since P4 levels normally 
start declining approaching parturition in floxed mice (5). Dysto-
cia phenotype (difficult delivery) seen in p53d/d mothers was also 
improved by Met and Rsv treatment. Overall, the results suggest 
that both Met and Rsv are effective in reducing the incidence of 
PTB in genetically predisposed mice, although Met appears to be 
more effective in reducing the incidence of PTB than Rsv, even at 
a much lower dose.
Met treatment improves decidual health. The decidua serves as 
a transient signaling hub that directs parturition timing (6). We 
previously reported that compromised decidual health and func-
tion in p53d/d females are reflected in premature decidual senes-
cence, increased rates of spontaneous PTB, and highly increased 
response to a small dose of LPS (4). To assess the effects of Met 
treatment on decidual health, we first examined the status of 
γH2AX associated with DNA damage followed by staining of 
senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal), 2 markers of 
decidual senescence (25), on day 16 in p53d/d mice pretreated with 
Met. Met treatment substantially reduced the number of γH2AX- 
positive decidual cells and intensity of SA-β-gal staining in p53d/d 
mice (Figure 2, A and B). Deciduae in p53d/d mice are normally 
much thinner because of premature and progressive senescence, 
metformin (Met) is widely used as a first-line therapy for diabe-
tes to increase insulin sensitivity (7, 8). Its off-label use in ovula-
tion induction in women with polycystic ovary syndrome is sup-
ported by its safety reports in pregnancy (9, 10). Met can inhibit 
mTORC1 through an AMP-activated protein kinase–dependent 
(AMPK-dependent) pathway by altering the AMP/ATP ratio (11, 
12) or through AMPK-independent pathways (13). Recent reports 
also show Met’s potential use as an anti-aging therapy (14); it is 
currently under a clinical trial to explore its anti-aging effects (15). 
Therefore, we speculated that Met would be a viable option to 
reduce the incidence of PTB. In the same vein, resveratrol (Rsv), a 
natural derivative of grapes, was reported to have antioxidant and 
anti-aging properties with health benefits, including protection 
from heart disease and obesity, as well as improvement of mito-
chondrial function (16, 17). However, Rsv’s definitive mechanism 
of action remains under investigation (18). Therefore, we asked 
whether Met or Rsv would mitigate PTB in p53d/d mice by alter-
ing AMPK and mTORC1 signaling without adverse effects on the 
mother and pups.
We show here that Met or Rsv fed intermittently was highly 
effective in rescuing spontaneous PTB in p53d/d mothers, and sub-
stantially reduced the incidence of PTB in p53d/d females exposed 
to LPS (10 μg) following a P4 injection. Further investigation found 
that these drugs execute their beneficial effects by forging an 
inverse relationship between AMPK and mTORC1 signaling to 
reduce PTB rates by attenuating decidual senescence. There is 
evidence that sestrin 2 (SESN2), a transcriptional target of p53, 
provokes AMPK activation and dampens mTORC1 signaling in 
human cell lines (19–21). We also found direct regulation of SESN2 
by p53 in mouse decidual cells and found that both mouse and 
human decidual cells are coordinated by p53-sestrin interactions 
to establish an inverse relationship between decidual AMPK and 
mTORC1 activities. These preclinical studies using mouse mod-
els and human decidual cells have generated new knowledge and 
insight in parturition biology that could provide a basis for thera-
peutics already being used in the treatment of specific pregnancy 
disorders to combat human PTB.
Results
Met or Rsv reduces the incidence of PTB in p53d/d females. Premature 
decidual senescence is a major cause of PTB in p53d/d females (2). 
The spontaneous PTB rate in p53d/d females ranges between 50% 
and 60%. This could be due to other compensatory mechanisms 
or individual variation in sensitivity to genetic disposition to PTB. 
Thus, when this genetic disposition experiences even a small 
inflammatory insult, 100% of p53d/d mothers show PTB (4). Since 
Met and Rsv are reported to attenuate cellular aging, increase 
lifespan, and inhibit mTORC1 activity with safe pharmacological 
profiles in pregnancy (9, 17, 22), we assessed the efficacy of Met 
or Rsv on parturition timing in p53d/d mice. p53fl/fl and p53d/d mice 
were given Met or Rsv during pregnancy (Figure 1, A and B), and 
parturition timing was assessed as previously described (4). Met 
given by oral gavages (1 mg/kg BW) on days 8, 10, and 12 remark-
ably decreased the rate of spontaneous PTB from 50% to only 
9% in p53d/d mothers (Figure 1C). Similarly, Rsv administered by 
oral gavages (30 mg/kg BW) on days 8, 10, 12, and 14 reduced 
the spontaneous PTB rate from 50% to only 10% in p53d/d mice

enced by AMPK signaling. We performed immunofluorescence 
(IF) localization of phosphorylated AMPK (pAMPK), as an index of 
AMPK activation, in p53fl/fl and p53d/d deciduae on day 16 of preg-
nancy with or without Met treatment. We found that IF intensity 
of pAMPK was much lower in p53d/d decidua compared with that 
in floxed littermates (Figure 2D). Met treatment increased the IF 
intensity of pAMPK in p53d/d decidua (Figure 2D), but did not show 
much effect in p53fl/fl deciduae with already higher pAMPK levels. 
The decreases in pAMPK and its downstream target pRAPTOR 
(28) were associated with increased pS6 levels (mTORC1 signal-
ing) in p53-deleted deciduae as evident from Western blotting 
results (Figure 2, E and F). Taken together, the results suggest that 
Met mitigates premature progression of decidual senescence by 
increasing pAMPK levels with decreased pS6 levels.
Met treatment attenuates PGE2 and PGF2α levels in combination 
with P4 in p53d/d deciduae. PTB in p53d/d dams is associated with 
increased decidual COX2 expression and PGF2α levels on day 16 
but decidual thickness was significantly improved in Met-treat-
ed p53d/d females (Figure 2B). Other indicators of decidual health 
were also assessed: prolactin receptor (Prlr) expression was exam-
ined by in situ hybridization and real-time PCR. Met treatment 
increased the signal intensity in both p53fl/fl and p53d/d deciduae, 
though it was initially lower in p53d/d decidua (Figure 2C). Real-
time PCR results more or less agree with in situ hybridization 
results (Supplemental Figure 2A). Blood vessel density, as deter-
mined by PECAM staining, increased in day 16 p53d/d deciduae 
after Met treatment (Supplemental Figure 2B).
Met upregulates AMPK signaling in p53d/d deciduae. The above 
results led us to explore the mechanism by which these drugs show 
clear pregnancy benefits in a genetically predisposed mouse mod-
el. AMPK is considered an energy/nutrient-sensing hub on which 
Met exerts its influence (11). Since cell energetics is tightly linked to 
cell lifespan, and since both Met and Rsv have been shown to alter 
AMPK signaling (26, 27), we asked whether PTB could be influ-

in p53fl/fl or p53d/d deciduae. Met treatment alone did not reduce 
the levels of PGF2α in p53d/d females (Figure 3, B and C). However, 
Met treatment combined with an injection of P4 reduced the lev-
els of PGF2α and PGE2 in p53d/d deciduae exposed to LPS (Figure 3, 
B and C). These results are consistent with our findings of Met’s 
inability to prevent PTB alone as opposed to substantial protec-
tion against PTB if Met treatment is combined with P4 after LPS 
exposure. Notably, Met reduced PGF2α and PGE2 levels in both 
p53fl/fl and p53d/d decidual cells in vitro, while Rsv decreased PGE2 
to trigger myometrial contractility (5). In addition to reducing 
the rate of PTB in p53d/d mice, Met treatment downregulated the 
decidual COX2 expression as examined by in situ hybridization 
(Figure 3A). Since prostaglandins (PGs) are known to participate 
in parturition, we measured PG levels by high-performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC) coupled with tandem mass spectrome-
try. We found that an injection of LPS (10 μg) on day 16 signifi-
cantly increased PGF2α levels in p53d/d deciduae without affecting 
the levels in p53fl/fl females; no changes in PGE2 levels were noted

of mTORC1 activity; Met even at a dose of 1 mM downregulated 
pS6 levels (Figure 4, A and B).
We then asked as to why the dose of Met we used in decidual-
ized stromal cells in vitro was so much higher than the dose used 
in vivo. Although several reasons, including differences in drug 
metabolic rate, uptake, and efficacy between in vivo and in vitro 
systems, could account for this observation, we think this discrep-
ancy is perhaps due to differential expression of Met transport-
ers in vivo and vitro. Met is transported inside the cell primarily 
by organic cationic transporters of the solute carrier family 22: 
SLC22A1 (OCT1) and SLC22A3 (OCT3) (31). Indeed, we found 
that while expression levels of Oct1 and Oct3 were much higher in 
the liver followed by intestine and decidua in vivo, their expres-
sions were much lower, but present, in decidual cells differentiat-
ed in vitro from stromal cells. This would suffice as to why a much 
higher concentration of Met is required to be effective in cultured 
cells (Supplemental Figure 5). In the same context, Rsv at different 
concentrations also upregulated pAMPK levels with downregula-
tion of pS6 (Figure 4, C and D).
Other downstream targets of mTORC1 signaling, includ-
ing HIF1α, pS6K (Thr389), p-eIF4E (Ser209), p4EBP1 (Thr70), 
p4EBP1 (Ser65), and p4EBP1 (Thr37/46), were also examined after 
Met or Rsv exposure in decidual cells in vitro. 4EBP1 upon phos-
phorylation serves as an activator of translation by releasing eIF4E 
levels with limited effects on PGF2α levels in both p53fl/fl and p53d/d 
decidual cells (Figure 3D). These results were reflected in lower 
Ptgs2 (encoding COX2) expression in decidual cells with Met or 
Rsv treatment (Figure 3, E and F). Similar inhibition of PTGS2 
(encoding COX2) expression was also noted in human decidual 
cells exposed to Rsv (Supplemental Figure 3).
Met or Rsv inversely regulates AMPK and mTORC1 signaling in 
decidual cells. Given that Met or Rsv treatment improves decidual 
health by attenuating senescence and reduces PTB rates in p53d/d 
mice, we explored the underlying mechanism by developing in 
vitro models of mouse and human decidualization and designed 
experiments to explore the molecular relationship between 
AMPK and mTORC1 signaling in the presence of Met or Rsv. WT 
mouse uterine stromal cells were isolated from day 4 pregnant 
mice and induced to decidualize in culture by hormone treat-
ments for 4 days (29). Differentiation of stromal cells to decidual 
cells was confirmed by highly upregulated expression of prolac-
tin family 8, subfamily a, member 2 (Prl8a2), a decidual marker 
in mice (ref. 30 and Supplemental Figure 4). Decidual cells were 
then cultured in the presence or absence of different concentra-
tions of Met or Rsv to identify the lowest effective concentration. 
We found that Met at a dose of 10 mM significantly increased 
the levels of pAMPK after 24 hours (Figure 4, A and B). This was 
associated with concomitant decreases in pS6 levels, an index

(32). We found that all of these downstream mediators were down-
regulated by Met or Rsv treatment of decidual cells (Supplemental 
Figure 6, A–D). These results provide credence to the robustness 
of the mTORC1 signaling and its relationship with AMPK activity.
We further evaluated the interaction between mTORC1 
and pAMPK signaling in decidualized stromal cells due to their 
inverse relationship in the presence of Met. Although both Met 
and rapamycin significantly inhibited pS6 activity in decidualized 
stromal cells, we found that rapamycin failed to alter the levels 
of pAMPK, suggesting that AMPK is upstream of the mTORC1 
signaling pathway in decidual cells (Figure 5, A and B), as shown 
previously in other systems (33). Interestingly, 5-AICAR (amino-
imidazole-4-carboxamide-1β-d-ribofuranoside), an activator of 
AMPK (34), upregulated the levels of pAMPK concomitantly with 
decreases in pS6 levels (Figure 4, E and F), suggesting that AMPK 
activation would attenuate mTORC1 signaling. Collectively, these 
results show that Met or Rsv coordinates an inverse relationship 
between AMPK and mTORC1 signaling in decidualized mouse 
stromal cells, thus slowing decidual senescence against PTB.
Met or Rsv confers an inverse relationship between AMPK and 
mTORC1 signaling in p53d/d decidual cells. To understand the intri-
cacies of AMPK and mTORC1 interactive regulation, p53fl/fl and 
p53d/d uterine stromal cells were decidualized in vitro and treated 
with Met or Rsv; these treated cells showed increases in pAMPK 
levels with downregulation of pS6 levels (Figure 5, C–F). Con-
sistent with our in vivo data (Figure 2D), baseline pAMPK levels 
were lower in primary p53d/d decidualized cells than in floxed 
stromal cells (Figure 5, C–F). To further explore the relationship 
of p53 with pAMPK and mTORC1 signaling, we used p53–/– mouse 
embryonic fibroblast cells (MEFs), which have higher pS6 levels 
than the parental cell line (Figure 5, G and H); this could be due 
to TSC2 as a direct target of p53 as evident from p53 enrichment 
in the TSC2 gene body as reported in published ChIP sequencing 
(ChIP-seq) data (35–37). p53–/– MEFs treated with Met showed 
increased pAMPK and decreased pS6 levels. These results again 
highlight a molecular interplay between AMPK and mTORC1 sig-
naling and provide evidence for the contributory role of Met or 
Rsv toward protection against PTB in p53d/d mice. Given the above

nificantly upregulated by Met (10 mM) with reduced pS6 levels. (C and D) Levels of pAMPK and pS6 and quantitation were altered at 50, 100, and 500 μM 
by Rsv. (E and F) Levels of pAMPK and pS6 and quantitation were significantly altered at 500 μM AICAR. *P < 0.05, mean ± SEM, ANOVA.

results, we asked whether Met or Rsv inhibition of mTORC1 activ-
ity is dependent on AMPK activity. We exposed Prkaa1–/– Prkaa2–/– 
double knockout (referred to here as AMPK dKO) MEFs to Met or 
Rsv, and, as expected, levels of pAMPK and its target pRAPTOR 
(28) were not upregulated in AMPK dKO cells. Notably, pS6 levels 
still showed downregulation in AMPK dKO MEFs (Supplemental 
Figure 7, A–D), suggesting that Met or Rsv can inhibit mTORC1 
signaling through an AMPK-independent pathway, consistent 
with the results of a recent report (13). Collectively, these results 
suggest that Met or Rsv can influence mTORC1 signaling through 
both AMPK-dependent and -independent pathways in a physio-
logical context and cell-dependent manner.
p53-sestrin interactions coordinate AMPK/mTORC1 signaling. 
To better understand how AMPK and mTORC1 signaling are inte-
grated by p53, we asked whether sestrins participate in this process.

To further assess the relationship between p53 and SESN2 
and their effects on AMPK and mTORC1 signaling, WT primary 
stromal cells decidualized in vitro were cultured in the presence 
or absence of Nutlin 3a or Doxo. We found that both p53 and 
SESN2 levels were upregulated; these results were associated with 
increases in pAMPK and attenuation of pS6 levels (Figure 7, A–E), 
suggesting that SESN2 interacts with p53 to set up a rheostat for 
reciprocal regulation of pAMPK and pS6 activities. The previous 
results in cell lines are supportive of our present findings in decid-
ual cells (21). A recent report also shows a relationship among p53, 
TSC2, and SESN2 to regulate mTORC1 activity through exclusion 
of lysosomal Rheb (42). Here we now show that overexpression 
of SESN2 in MEFs upregulates pAMPK levels with concomi-
tant decreases in pS6 levels (Figure 7, F–I). These results provide 
evidence that AMPK is a downstream target of SESN2 and that 
increased pAMPK signaling interferes with mTORC1 signaling.
Effects of Met and Rsv are conserved in human decidual cells. We 
next asked whether activation of AMPK and inhibition of mTORC1 
signaling are conserved in human decidual cells. Human uterine 
fibroblast (HuF) cells were differentiated into decidual cells in 
culture (43); highly upregulated expression of IGF-binding pro-
tein 1 (IGFBP1) and prolactin (PRL), 2 reliable decidual markers in 
humans (43), confirmed successful decidualization (Supplemental 
Figure 9, A and B). Decidual cells were then treated with Met or 
Rsv. The results showed a similar signature of reciprocal upregu-
lation of pAMPK with downregulation of pS6 levels by Met (Figure 
8, A–D). However, Rsv showed limited upregulation of pAMPK but 
with higher levels of inhibition of pS6. This relationship between 
pAMPK and pS6 levels was also noted in human primary decidual 
cells isolated from term placentas when cultured in the presence of 
Met or Rsv in a dose-responsive manner (Figure 8, E–J). Notably, 
human decidual tissues and cells cultured in vitro maintained their 
and are stress-inducible regulators of AMPK/mTORC1 signaling 
(38). They are thought to attenuate cellular aging by altering cell 
metabolism and are induced by genotoxic stresses, such as DNA 
damage responses (20), perhaps through AMPK signaling (21). 
To address their roles in the decidua in the context of p53, we 
first assessed the expression of Sesn1 and Sesn2 in p53fl/fl and p53d/d 
deciduae on day 16 as well as in WT and p53–/– MEFs. We found that 
Sesn2 expression was substantially lower in p53d/d deciduae com-
pared with floxed deciduae (Figure 6B). Levels of Sesn2 were also 
low in p53–/– MEFs (Figure 6D). However, no significant changes in 
Sesn1 levels were noted in either day 16 deciduae or MEFs (Figure 
6, A and C). Western blotting results also showed reduced SESN2 
expression in p53d/d deciduae on day 16 (Figure 6, E and F). Real-
time PCR results showed that Met substantially increased Sesn2 
transcript levels in both p53fl/fl and p53d/d deciduae on day 16 (Sup-
plemental Figure 8). Furthermore, Sesn2 was found to be primarily 
localized in deciduae by IHC. We observed that its expression was 
lower in day 16 p53d/d deciduae, which was substantially improved 
by Met treatment (Figure 6G). This corroborates other findings 
that Met or Rsv increases Sesn2 expression (39–41). We next asked 
whether p53 can directly regulate the expression of Sesn2. Using 
published Chip-seq data sets (35–37), we found a conserved p53 
regulatory element in the first intron of SESN2 in both mice and 
humans (Figure 6, H and I). To directly assess the role of p53 in 
Sesn2 expression, we cloned the p53-enriched fragment into a 
luciferase reporter construct and transfected it into WT and p53–/– 
MEFs. These cells were then treated with Nutlin 3a, a stabilizer of 
p53 that inhibits the endogenous p53-degrading enzyme MDM2, 
or doxorubicin (Doxo), a DNA intercalating agent that enhances 
p53 activity. We found increased luciferase activity in WT MEFs in 
the presence of Nutlin 3a or Doxo, but not in p53–/– MEFs (Figure 
6J), suggesting that p53 directly regulates Sesn2 expression.
Figure 7. p53 induces SESN2 expression to modulate AMPK and mTORC1 signaling. (A–E) Nutlin and Doxo upregulated the levels of p53, SESN2, and 
pAMPK with downregulation of pS6 levels in decidualized stromal cells (n = 3, *P < 0.05, mean ± SEM, ANOVA). (F–I) SESN2 overexpression inversely 
regulated pAMPK and pS6 levels (n = 3, *P < 0.05, mean ± SEM, Student’s t test).

Discussion
This investigation has identified AMPK as a novel signaling path-
way involved in parturition and highlights the role of p53-ses-
trin interactions that integrate AMPK and mTORC1 signaling to 
determine parturition timing. We initially used Met and Rsv to 
rescue PTB syndrome in p53d/d mice, and the results have been 
highly instrumental in exploring the molecular linkage of prema-
ture decidual senescence with AMPK/mTORC1 signaling in PTB 
(4). Our study shows that an inverse relationship between AMPK 
activation and mTORC1 signaling is organized in the decidua by 
Met or Rsv treatment to restrain premature decidual senescence, 
decidual characteristics, expressing decidual cell markers (Supple-
mental Figure 9, C and D). Additionally, HuF cells decidualized in 
vitro maintained the expression of decidual markers in the presence 
or absence of Met or Rsv, suggesting that these compounds do not 
interfere with the decidualization process (Supplemental Figure 9, 
E–H). We also found that pAMPK and mTORC1 signaling shows a 
positive correlation with the expression of both SESN1 and SESN2 
upon exposure to P4 in term decidual cells, while preterm decidual 
cells were nonresponsive (Figure 8, K and L). Taken together, the 
results show that this relationship is preserved in human decidual 
cells and may well be linked to human parturition.
Figure 8. p53-sestrin interactions coordinate AMPK and mTORC1 signaling in human decidual cells. (A–D) Met or Rsv inversely regulated pAMPK and pS6 
levels in HuF cells (n = 3, *P < 0.05, mean ± SEM, Student’s t test). (E–J) pAMPK and pS6 levels were inversely regulated by Met or Rsv in human primary 
decidual cells isolated from term placentas. Each sample was isolated from a discrete decidua from a single patient. pAMPK and pS6 levels were inversely 
regulated by Met or Rsv (n = 4, *P < 0.05, mean ± SEM, ANOVA). (K and L) SESN1 and SESN2 mRNA was upregulated by P4 in term decidual cells, but not 
in preterm decidual cells (n = 3, *P < 0.05, mean ± SEM, Student’s t test).

that they can act independently of AMPK to attenuate mTORC1 
activity. These observations suggest that the relationship between 
AMPK and mTORC1 signaling is complex and context dependent, 
which corroborates previous findings in other systems (13, 46). The 
observation of the requirement of a low dose of Met (1 mg/kg BW 
per mouse) to be effective in vivo as opposed to a much higher con-
centration (10 mM) in cultured decidual cells was perhaps due to 
higher expression of Oct1 and Oct3 in tissues in vivo as compared 
with much lower expression in cultured cells; OCTs serve as trans-
porters to deliver Met inside the cell. In this respect, several studies 
used Met at 10 mM to be effective (13, 47, 48).
Our present results also show a relationship between p53-ses-
trin and AMPK/mTORC1 signaling and their integration to opti-
mize decidual function. Sestrins are known transcriptional targets 
of p53 with antioxidant and anti-aging properties (20, 21, 49). 
Deletion of sestrins incurs abnormal accumulation of metabolically 
active oxidants and hastens cellular aging (50). There is evidence 
that SESN2 can also target mTORC1 signaling via an AMPK-inde-
pendent mechanism by directly binding with Raptor, a component 
of the mTORC1 complex, or with GATOR2 in an amino acid–sen-
sitive manner, or with RAG A/B–RAG C/D GTPases to promote 
mTORC1 translocation to lysosome (21, 51–53). Our observation 
of transcriptional activation of SESN2 by p53, its low levels in p53d/d 
decidual cells, and its unresponsiveness to Nutlin 3a or Doxo in p53–/– 
MEFs provide evidence that dysregulation of sestrins is relevant to 
premature decidual senescence and PTB in p53d/d dams. The induc-
tion of p53 by Nutlin 3a or Doxo along with increases in SESN2 and 
pAMPK levels concomitantly with downregulation of pS6 levels in 
decidual cells suggests that p53-SESN2 interactions can influence 
AMPK/mTORC1 signaling in deciduae to coordinate parturition 
timing. Our findings of stimulation of SESN1 and SESN2 by P4 in 
term decidual cells, but its inability to influence their expressions 
in human preterm decidual cells, suggest that this complex system 
also operates in calibrating human parturition timing.
The robust protective effects of Met or Rsv against PTB in 
p53d/d females are clinically relevant. If used cautiously, these 
drugs can safely target decidual senescence by establishing recip-
rocal interactions between AMPK and mTORC1 signaling. We 
can predict Met’s safety in pregnancy through its approval for the 
treatment of type 2 diabetes and its frequent use with clomiphene 
as a first line of therapy for ovulation induction in the treatment 
of infertile patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (54). A meta-
analysis of 8 small studies has shown that it does not yield major 
adverse effects, including maternal hyperinsulinemia and fetal 
hypoglycemia, if consumed in the first trimester (10).
Rsv is an increasingly studied agent for its antioxidant and 
anticancer properties (55). It is reported to activate AMPK to 
ameliorate aging (17, 56–60). In mice, long-term administration 
of Rsv has been shown to delay aging-related deterioration and 
shows gene expression patterns similar to those induced by caloric 
restriction (61). In a mouse study, Rsv increased uterine arterial 
blood flow velocity and fetal weight in eNos–/– and Comt–/– mice, 
suggesting potential as a therapeutic strategy for preeclampsia 
and fetal growth restriction (22). There is now evidence that an 
inflammatory stimulus insufficient to induce PTB during the late 
gestational stage is likely to trigger neurological disorders in the 
newborn later in life (62, 63). It would be interesting to see wheth-
offering protection against spontaneous and inflammation-exac-
erbated PTB in p53d/d mice. The observation that Met and Rsv have 
protective roles against premature decidual senescence-associat-
ed PTB is an exciting development since both are now known to 
have anti-aging properties and reportedly extend lifespan (17, 44). 
Met can inhibit mTORC1 activity via AMPK-dependent or -inde-
pendent pathways (7), whereas Rsv inhibits the hyperactivated 
mTORC1 pathway (45). Although mTORC1 signaling has taken 
center stage in cellular senescence, our in vivo and in vitro results 
suggest that a tightly regulated reciprocal integration of AMPK 
and mTORC1 signaling together plays a significant role in the 
decidual senescence in both mice and humans.
Attenuation of cellular senescence, evident from reduced 
SA-β-gal staining, sparse numbers of γH2AX-positive cells, and 
improved markers of decidual health with Met pretreatment, is a 
testament to the beneficial effects of this drug during pregnancy. 
Our observations of the reciprocal relationship between pAMPK 
and mTORC1 in response to Met or Rsv, preserved in both deciduae 
in vivo and primary stromal cells decidualized in culture, as well as 
in primary human cultured decidual cells, present the importance 
of the reciprocal interactions between these 2 pathways in parturi-
tion. Our observation of Met’s effectiveness to upregulate pAMPK 
levels in decidual cells in the face of inhibition of mTORC1 activi-
ty by rapamycin suggests that Met’s influence on AMPK signaling 
need not necessarily be limited by rapamycin. However, downreg-
ulation of pS6 levels in AMPK dKO MEFs by Met or Rsv indicates 
Figure 9. A schematic representation of the role of decidual p53-sestrin 
interactions to integrate AMPK and mTORC1 signaling in determining 
parturition timing. Increased AMPK signaling by SESNs in mouse and 
human decidual cells with downregulation of mTORC1 signaling by p53 
and further enhanced by Met or Rsv provides protection against preterm 
birth (PTB) This downregulation of mTORC1 signaling with increased  
pAMPK activity is reflected in attenuated protein translation involving 
pS6K and/or p4EBP1. This perhaps helps rescue PTB.

tion by treatment of estradiol-17β (E2, 10 nM) and progesterone (P4, 
1 μM) in phenol red–free DMEM/F12 media supplemented with 
 
charcoal-stripped 1% FBS (vol/vol). These cells were treated with Met 
(10 mM), Rsv (50 μM), AICAR (500 μM), rapamycin (1 nM), Nutlin 3a 
(5 μM), or doxorubicin (0.5 μM).
WT and p53–/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were generated 
in house, and MEFs from Prkaa1–/–Prkaa2–/– (AMPK dKO) mice (gener-
ated by the Viollet laboratory, Université Paris Descartes) were cultured 
in DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS (vol/vol). Human uterine 
fibroblast (HuF) cells, generated and shared by the late Stuart Handw-
erger (Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center), were cultured in 
DMEM/F12 containing 5% charcoal-stripped FBS (vol/vol) and decidu-
alized with E2 (10 nM), medroxyprogesterone acetate (1 μM), and PGE2 
(10 nM) in DMEM/F12 containing 1% charcoal-stripped FBS (vol/vol) 
for 6 days. The medium was changed every other day (43).
In situ hybridization. In situ hybridization was performed as 
described previously (4). Implantation sites were collected and 
flash-frozen. Cryosections (12 μm) were mounted onto poly-l-lysine–
coated slides, fixed in cold 4% paraformaldehyde, acetylated, and 
hybridized at 45°C for 4 hours in formamide hybridization buffer con-
taining 35S-labeled Prlr (long isoform) and Ptgs2 (Cox2) cRNA probes. 
RNase A–resistant hybrids were detected by autoradiography using 
Kodak NTB-2 liquid emulsion. Both p53fl/fl and p53d/d sections were 
placed onto the same slide and processed for hybridization.
IHC and IF staining. Immunostaining was performed in forma-
lin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections using specific antibodies to 
γH2AX and SESN2. Sections from p53fl/fl, p53d/d, or Met-treated tissues on 
day 16 of pregnancy were processed onto the same slide. For IF studies, 
paraformaldehyde-fixed frozen sections (12 μm) were blocked with 5% 
BSA in PBS and immunostained by antibodies for pAMPK and PECAM. 
Signals were visualized by secondary antibody conjugated with Cy3 flu-
orophore (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Sections were coun-
terstained with Hoechst 33342 (2 μg/ml; Life Technologies). Applications 
and descriptions of antibodies are presented in Supplemental Table 1.
SA-β-gal staining. Staining of SA-β-gal activity was performed as 
described previously (4). Frozen sections were fixed in 0.5% glutar-
aldehyde in PBS and stained for 6 hours in PBS (pH 5.5) containing 
 
1 mM MgCl2, 1 mg/ml X-gal, and 5 mM each of potassium ferricyanide 
and potassium ferrocyanide. Sections were counterstained with eosin.
Western blotting. Protein extraction and Western blotting were per-
formed as previously described (4). Antibodies to pRAPTOR, RAPTOR, 
pS6, S6, pS6K, S6K, pAMPK, AMPK, p4EBP1, 4EBP1, p-eIF4E, eIF4E, 
SESN2, p53, Actin, and α-Tubulin were used (Supplemental Table 1). 
Bands were visualized using an ECL Prime Western blotting detection 
system (GE Healthcare). Actin and α-tubulin served as loading controls.
RNA isolation and quantitative PCR. RNA was prepared from 
homogenized tissues using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNA extraction 
was performed as described previously (4). Quantitative PCR was per-
formed using StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Bioscienc-
es). PCR was performed using the following primers: 5′-GCAGATGTAC-
CGCACTGAGATTC-3′ and 5′-ACCTTTGGGCTTACTCCATTGATA-3′ 
for mouse Rpl7; 5′-CCAGATGTGGGACAGTTA-3′ and 5′-CCAGAT-
GTGGGACAGTTA-3′ for Sesn1; 5′-ACTGCGTCTTTGGCATCA-3′ and 
5′-CATCCTACGGGTCGTCTTCT-3′ for Sesn2; 5′-TTCAGGGAGAAG-
CGTTTGC-3′ and 5′-ACACACTCTATCACTGGCACC-3′ for Ptgs2 
(encoding COX2); 5′-GGATGTGACTTACATTGTTGAACCA-3′ and 
5′-TACCCACAGATATGTTTTTTTGTCTTT-3′ for Prlr; 5′-CCAAACT-
er Met or Rsv could alleviate these risks in future investigation. 
However, both risks and benefits must be carefully weighed with 
regard to use of Met or Rsv during pregnancy.
In essence, this study has gleaned that PTB in genetically pre-
disposed mice can be attenuated with intermittent administration 
of low doses of Met, and that both Met and Rsv attenuate decidual 
mTORC1 activity by increasing AMPK signaling to improve decid-
ual health. While studying the effect of these drugs, we generated 
valuable insight regarding transcriptional regulation of sestrins 
by p53 to fine-tune and integrate AMPK and mTORC1 signaling 
pathways in decidual senescence and parturition timing (Figure 
9). This study’s clinical value is apparent since human decidual 
cells showed a similar signature of increased AMPK signaling with 
reduced mTORC1 activity upon exposure to Met or Rsv treatment. 
These preclinical studies could provoke interest in designing a 
stepwise approach to strategies targeting human PTB.
Methods
Mice and drug treatment. Trp53loxP/loxPPgrCre/+ mice were maintained by 
mating of Trp53loxP/loxP mice (FVB/129) with PgrCre/+ mice (C57BL/6–129) 
to generate mice with uterine deletion of Trp53 (p53d/
d mice). Trp53loxP/loxP 
 
mice were obtained from the Mouse Models of Human Cancers Con-
sortium, while PgrCre/+ mice were initially provided by John Lydon and 
Francesco DeMayo (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). Ultra-
pure TLR4-specific LPS (10 μg/mouse, i.p.; InvivoGen) was admin-
istered on day 16 of pregnancy at 1200 hours. Met was suspended in 
5% PEG400 and 5% Tween-80 dissolved in water and was given by 
an oral gavage as indicated (1 mg/kg BW per dose) on days 8, 10, and 
12. Rsv was suspended in 0.5% methylcellulose dissolved in water and 
given by oral gavage as indicated (30 mg/kg BW per dose) on days 8, 
10, 12, and 14. The control group received vehicle alone. Progester-
one (P4) was dissolved in sesame oil and administered s.c. (1 or 2 mg/
mouse) 4 hours before LPS injection (10 μg/mouse).
Analysis of parturition. Parturition events were monitored as 
described previously (4). Briefly, parturition was checked from day 16 
through day 21 by observation of mice daily, morning (0600–0700 
hours), noon (1200 hours), and evening (1800–2000 hours). Birth 
timing was defined by the observation of the first born pup. PTB was 
defined as birth occurring earlier than day 19 of pregnancy (day 1 = 
vaginal plug in the morning). Dystocia was defined as difficult delivery 
lasting more than 12 hours. Resorption sites and placental scars were 
identified in dams showing preterm or difficult deliveries by examina-
tion of the uterus. The number of pups/masses delivered was com-
pared with the number of resorption sites and placental scars.
Measurement of PG profiles. Implantation sites from which fetuses 
and placentas had been removed were collected on day 17 of pregnan-
cy. These tissues were flash-frozen and stored at –80°C until used for 
extractions. For intracellular measurement of PGs, stromal cells from 
p53fl/fl and p53d/d mice were decidualized with hormones for 4 days in cul-
ture and then treated with Met and Rsv for 24 hours and 6 hours, respec-
tively. These cells were washed with cold PBS and pelleted. Pellets were 
stored frozen at –80°C. Methanolic extracts were partially purified using 
C18 solid-phase extraction columns (Agilent), and PGs were quantified 
by HPLC–tandem mass spectrometry as previously described (4).
Cell culture and treatments. Stromal cells from day 4 of pregnancy 
were collected by enzymatic digestion as described previously (29). 
The cells were cultured overnight before the initiation of decidualiza-

Statistics. Statistical analyses were performed using 2-tailed Stu-
dent’s t test, ANOVA, and χ2 tests. P values less than 0.05 were consid-
ered statistically significant.
Study approval. All mice used in this investigation were housed in 
the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center Animal Care Facil-
ity according to NIH and institutional guidelines for the use of labo-
ratory animals. All protocols of the present study were reviewed and 
approved by the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Research Foundation 
IACUC. Mice were given autoclaved rodent LabDiet 5010 (Purina) 
and UV light–sterilized reverse osmosis/deionization (RO/DI) con-
stant-circulation water ad libitum and were housed under a constant 
12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle.
For human samples, term and preterm human placentas were 
obtained from women with singleton vaginal term or preterm deliv-
ery. None of the women undergoing term vaginal delivery showed 
any clinical or pathological signs of preterm delivery, infection, or 
other maternal or placental diseases. Three women all with singleton 
preterm vaginal delivery were between 27 and 37 years old. One, a 
primipara, had PTB at 23 weeks and 4 days; the second, also a primipa-
ra with a past history of PTB, gave PTB at 23 weeks and 5 days; and the 
third had premature rupture of membranes and gave PTB at 31 weeks. 
They did not show clinical or pathological signs of other maternal or 
placental diseases apart from preterm delivery. Newborns did not have 
any apparent birth or chromosomal abnormalities. Collection and pro-
cessing of human placental samples were approved by the research 
ethics committee at the University of Tokyo under the approved IRB 
protocol no. 3456, and all patients provided written informed consent.

Mouse Sesn2 overexpression. Mouse Sesn2 cDNA was amplified 
and inserted into pCMV-tag2B containing a Flag tag. This plasmid 
was transfected in MEFs by Lipofectamine 2000. Flag antibody was 
used to confirm the expression of Sesn2. The primers used for cDNA

5′-GGTCATGTAGCGGGTGATGGCGCGC-3′.
Measurement of serum P4 levels. Mouse blood samples were col-
lected on day 16 of pregnancy at the prescribed time after treat-
ments. Serum levels of P4 were measured by enzyme immunoassay 
kits (Cayman Chemical).
Isolation and culture of human decidual cells. Term and preterm 
human decidual cells were isolated and cultured according to previ-
ously described protocols (4). Briefly, deciduae were scraped from the 
maternal surface of the chorion and used for RNA extraction. For cell 
culture, the deciduae were minced, and digested in Ham’s F-10 media 
containing 25 mg/ml collagenase and 6.25 U/ml DNase in a shaking 
water bath at 37°C for 30 minutes. Digested samples were passed 
through a 23-gauge needle to dissociate remaining cell clusters, cen-
trifuged at 250 g for 5 minutes, and washed in the culture media. The 
cell pellet was resuspended in 20% Percoll, layered on a discontinu-
ous Percoll gradient (60%:50%:40%), and centrifuged at 540 g for 
20 minutes. The upper cell layer was collected, washed, centrifuged, 
resuspended in 40% Percoll, layered on a discontinuous Percoll gra-
dient (55%:50%:45%), and centrifuged at 540 g for 20 minutes. The 
upper cell layer was washed and resuspended in DMEM/F-12 media 
containing 5% FBS. Cells were passaged at least 3 times and plated in 
12-well plates at 2 × 105 cells per well for experiments.
Identification of whole-genome p53 binding sites, construction of a 
luciferase reporter, and transfection. The databases used in this study 
were from GEO GSE46240 (36), GSE26360 (35), and GSE58740 (37). 
Sequenced reads were aligned to the mouse genome (mm9) or human 
genome (hg19) by bowtie, and reads with more than 2 aligned positions 
were removed. Only nonredundant reads that passed the quality score 
were kept for downstream analysis. ChIP-seq tags were then analyzed 
using MACS2 (Model-Based Analysis of ChIP-Seq) to identify the 
peaks. Mouse Sesn2 intron localized in chr4:132509504–132509997 
was inserted in pGL3-Basic and transfected in MEFs with pRL-TK by 
Lipofectamine 2000. These cells were treated with Nutlin or doxorubi-
cin for 6 hours and then collected for luciferase measurement.
