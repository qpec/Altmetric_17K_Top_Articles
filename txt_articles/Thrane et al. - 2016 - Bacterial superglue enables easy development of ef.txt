Abstract 
Background: Virus‑like particles (VLPs) represent a significant advance in the development of subunit vaccines, com‑
bining high safety and efficacy. Their particulate nature and dense repetitive subunit organization makes them ideal 
scaffolds for display of vaccine antigens. Traditional approaches for VLP‑based antigen display require labor‑intensive 
trial‑and‑error optimization, and often fail to generate dense antigen display. Here we utilize the split‑intein (SpyTag/
SpyCatcher) conjugation system to generate stable isopeptide bound antigen‑VLP complexes by simply mixing of the 
antigen and VLP components.
Results: Genetic fusion of SpyTag or SpyCatcher to the N‑terminus and/or C‑terminus of the Acinetobacter phage 
AP205 capsid protein resulted in formation of stable, nonaggregated VLPs expressing one SpyCatcher, one SpyTag 
or two SpyTags per capsid protein. Mixing of spy‑VLPs with eleven different vaccine antigens fused to SpyCatcher or 
SpyTag resulted in formation of antigen‑VLP complexes with coupling efficiencies (% occupancy of total VLP binding 
sites) ranging from 22–88 %. In mice, spy‑VLP vaccines presenting the malaria proteins Pfs25 or VAR2CSA markedly 
increased antibody titer, affinity, longevity and functional efficacy compared to corresponding vaccines employing 
monomeric proteins. The spy‑VLP vaccines also effectively broke B cell self‑tolerance and induced potent and durable 
antibody responses upon vaccination with cancer or allergy‑associated self‑antigens (PD‑L1, CTLA‑4 and IL‑5).
Conclusions: The spy‑VLP system constitutes a versatile and rapid method to develop highly immunogenic VLP‑
based vaccines. Our data provide proof‑of‑concept for the technology’s ability to present complex vaccine antigens 
to the immune system and elicit robust functional antibody responses as well as to efficiently break B cell self‑toler‑
ance. The spy‑VLP‑system may serve as a generic tool for the cost‑effective development of effective VLP‑vaccines 
against both infectious‑ and non‑communicable diseases and could facilitate rapid and unbiased screening of vac‑
cine candidate antigens.

Background
Active vaccination against infectious diseases has been 
one of the most effective medical interventions in human 
history with a tremendous impact on global health. Due 
to safety-, manufacturing- and reproducibility concerns, 
global vaccine development has gradually turned its focus 
away from whole-pathogen based vaccines and towards 
recombinant subunit vaccines based on defined antigen 
components [1]. The effectiveness of simple subunit vac-
cines is, however, considerably inferior to that of whole-
pathogen-based vaccines and the successful development 
of soluble proteins as vaccine candidates has in many 
cases been a disappointment. The low immunogenicity 
of soluble protein antigens has been attributed to their

small size (<10 nm), susceptibility to proteolytic degrada-
tion, and a low capacity for activating the innate immune 
system. Virus-like particles (VLPs) represent a specific 
class of particulate subunit vaccines, which are highly 
immunogenic due to sharing key characteristics with live 
viruses [2]. Several VLP-vaccines have already been com-
mercialized e.g. Engerix (hepatitis B virus) and Cervarix 
(human papillomavirus) by GlaxoSmithKline, Recom-
bivax HB (hepatitis B virus) and Gardasil (human papil-
lomavirus) by Merck, and Hecolin (hepatitis E virus) by 
Xiamen Innovax [3]. VLPs are safe non-replicating shells 
consisting solely of viral structural proteins that, when 
overexpressed, self-assemble into dense multi-protein 
arrays with icosahedral or rod-like structures. The size of 
VLPs (20–200 nm) allows for direct drainage into lymph 
nodes and is optimal for uptake by antigen-presenting 
cells and cross-presentation [4]. Their highly repetitive 
surface structures moreover enable complement fixation 
and B cell receptor clustering, altogether leading to the 
activation of the innate immune system, greater B cell 
activation and ultimately increased antibody production 
[4–6]. Importantly, it has been established that hetorol-
ogous antigens displayed on VLPs can assume a similar 
immunogenicity as the underlying particle, creating a 
strong rational for using VLPs as antigen-presenting plat-
forms to increase immune responses against otherwise 
poorly immunogenic antigens [2, 7]. Antigen display has 
traditionally been achieved by either genetic fusion of 
heterologous epitopes into the self-assembling coat pro-
tein or by conjugation to preassembled VLPs. Genetic 
fusion of smaller peptides (often single epitopes) has in 
several cases been successful, whereas insertion of larger 
sequences generally prevents VLP-assembly [2, 8, 9]. Even 
if VLP-assembly is achieved, chimeric particles are often 
instable and the functional conformation of the inserted 
epitope may not be retained. Consequently, the genetic 
fusion approach is inevitably based on substantial trial-
and-error optimization and is largely restricted to con-
tinuous epitopes thus requiring the pre-identification of 
such determinants in the target-antigen. Chemical cross-
linking chemistry has been employed to conjugate target 
antigens to pre-assembled VLPs by stimulating covalent 
linkage between reactive amino acid side chains in the 
antigen and coat protein sequences, respectively [10, 11]. 
Complex antigens, however, generally present multiple 
reactive sites hampering consistent directional coupling 
of the antigen to the VLP required for optimal epitope 
display. In addition, such chemical reactions often result 
in a lower than optimal density of the VLP-displayed 
antigen [10, 12]. Other strategies, involving non-covalent 
antigen-VLP conjugation have also been pursued, each 
with individual advantages and disadvantages [13, 14]. 
The most successful general approach was developed by 
Cytos Biotech and involves the terminal addition of a 
reactive Cysteine residue to the target-antigen followed 
by addition of a hetero-bifunctional cross-linker to medi-
ate coupling between the reactive sulfhydryl group (Cys) 
and the N-term of Lysine residues exposed on the sur-
face of Qbeta VLPs [10, 15]. Several promising VLP-vac-
cines have been developed by this technology, although 
this method suffers from an inconsistent ability to dis-
play complex antigens with conformation-dependent 
epitopes. Therefore, there is a strong interest in devel-
oping new methods to obtain optimal VLP-display for 
complex target-antigens. Herein we report the use of the 
split-intein (SpyTag/SpyCatcher) conjugation system [16] 
to facilitate conjugation of target antigens to VLPs under 
physiological conditions. This conjugation system takes 
advantage of the spontaneous formation of an isopeptide 
bond between a Lys and an Asp present in two split units 
of the Streptococcus pyogenes fibronectin-binding pro-
tein FbaB. These split units consist of a peptide (SpyTag) 
and a protein (SpyCatcher), which in solution interact to 
form a highly stable amide bond. The irreversible reac-
tion occurs within minutes and so this technology offers 
a simple way to conjugate antigen to VLPs. We devel-
oped a panel of genetically modified Acinetobacter phage 
AP205 VLPs displaying either the SpyCatcher protein 
(116 amino acids) or the SpyTag peptide (13 amino acids) 
in regular arrays. We also engineered an AP205 VLP pre-
senting two SpyTags per VLP subunit (2xSpyTag-VLP). 
We characterized these spy-VLPs in terms of stability 
and antigen display capacity using a variety of antigens 
and discuss how the different spy-VLPs can be used to 
increase the versatility of the spy-VLP display system. 
Using two malaria antigens, we demonstrate that the spy-
VLP system elicited high levels of high affinity IgG, which 
effectively inhibited key processes in the parasite devel-
opment. Finally, we show that B cell self-tolerance can 
be overcome by the spy-VLP system, which effectively 
induced IgG against a range of self-antigens including 
PD-L1, CTLA-4 and IL-5. Thus, the data demonstrate the 
broad usability of the spy-VLP platform and validate its 
ability to facilitate strong functional antibody responses 
against complex vaccine antigens.
Results
Development, expression and characterization of spy‑VLPs
A panel of SpyTag or SpyCatcher presenting VLPs was 
designed based on the Acinetobacter phage AP205 coat 
protein. Expression of this protein in Escherichia coli 
results in the assembly of 29 nm icosahedral (T = 3) VLPs 
consisting of 180 subunits [17]. Precisely, the 116 amino 
acid SpyCatcher sequence was fused to the N-terminus 
(SpyCatcher-VLP) of the AP205 coat protein (Gene ID: 
956335). In addition, the 13 amino acid SpyTag peptide

was fused to N-terminus (SpyTag-VLP) or to both N- and 
C-terminus (2xSpyTag-VLP) of the AP205 coat protein 
(Fig. 1a). Recombinant E. coli expression of spy-AP205 
coat proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis of 
fractions collected following density gradient ultracen-
trifugation. Reduced SDS-PAGE showed pure protein 
bands of expected sizes (Additional file 1: Figure S1). 
VLP-assembly of each spy-AP205 coat proteins was 
evaluated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) 
(Fig. 1b) and dynamic light-scattering (DLS) analysis. 
For all recombinant particles the DLS analysis revealed a 
homogenous population of non-aggregated particles with 
an average estimated size of 36 nm [Pd = 12.1] (SpyTag-
VLP), 42 nm [Pd = 21.6] (2xSpyTag-VLP) and 43 nm 
[Pd = 9.7] (SpyCatcher-VLP). In comparison, unmodified 
AP205 VLPs were determined by DLS to have an average 
size of 35 nm [Pd = 10.7].
To test if the recombinant spy-VLPs could form a cova-
lent interaction with an antigen through their SpyTag 
or SpyCatcher, individual spy-VLPs were mixed with 
antigen fused to the corresponding binding-partner and 
formation of antigen-VLP subunit conjugates was sub-
sequently confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis. For all spy-
VLP types and all tested antigens the SDS-PAGE revealed 
the occurrence of a protein band matching the combined 
size of the antigen and VLP subunit, as exemplified in 
Fig. 1c. Mixing of SpyTag- or SpyCatcher-fused antigen 
with unmodified AP205 VLPs did not produce this band-
ing pattern (data not shown).
Versatility of the spy‑VLP platform
To explore the versatility of the spy-VLP antigen display 
system we cloned and expressed 11 vaccine candidate 
antigens genetically fused to either a SpyTag or a Spy-
Catcher (Additional file 2: Table S1). The panel of spy-
antigens, representing very diverse proteins with respect 
to origin, structure and size (14.5–118 kDa) included; 
(a) malaria proteins: CSP, CIDR, VAR2CSA, and Pfs25, 
which are expressed at different developmental stages 
of the complex life cycle of Plasmodium falciparum and 
used in different vaccine strategies to reduce malaria 
transmission or disease [18, 19]; (b) the Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis protein, Ag85A, in development for a tuber-
culosis vaccine; (c) mouse proteins involved in cancer 
(CTLA-4, PD-L1, Survivin and HER2), asthma/allergy 
(IL-5) or cardiovascular disease (PCSK9). The latter self-
proteins are targets of therapies employing monoclonal 
antibody. The vaccine antigens were mixed with corre-
sponding spy-VLPs and the antigen coupling efficiency (% 
occupancy of total VLP binding sites) and antigen display 
capacity (number of antigens per VLP) was estimated 
for each reaction by SDS-PAGE densitometric analysis. 
Standard molar mixing ratio was 1:1.5 (VLP:antigen) and

(33 kDa) (middle) and unconjugated SpyTag‑VLP capsid protein 
(16.5 kDa) (bottom). The middle panel shows that mixing of 2xSpyTag‑
VLP with SpyCatcher‑IL‑5 resulted in four protein bands represent‑
ing; a conjugate of two vaccine antigens bound to each end of 
a 2xSpyTag‑VLP capsid protein (83 kDa), a conjugate of the 2xSpyTag‑
VLP capsid protein and a single vaccine antigen (48 kDa), uncoupled 
vaccine antigen (33 kDa) and unconjugated 2xSpyTag‑VLP capsid 
protein (18.5 kDa). The left panel shows that mixing of SpyCatcher‑VLP 
with PD‑L1‑SpyTag resulted in three protein bands representing; an 
antigen‑VLP capsid protein conjugate (50 kDa), uncoupled vaccine 
antigen (33 kDa) and unconjugated SpyCatcher‑VLP capsid protein 
(27 kDa)

reactions occurred over night at 4 °C. A similar coupling 
efficiency was observed using three-hour incubations at 
37 °C (data not shown). Overall, antigen-coupling effi-
ciencies ranged from 22–88 %, corresponding to 40–159 
antigens displayed per VLP (Table 1).
There was a negative correlation between antigen size 
and the number of antigens bound per VLP (Spearman 
Rank Order Correlation Coeff. = −0.75, P = 0.02) (the 
2xSpyTag-VLP constructs were excluded from the analy-
sis). There was no significant difference in the antigen 
coupling efficiency in SpyTag-VLP and SpyCatcher-VLP 
reactions. However, the estimated coupling capacity was 
higher for the reaction between SpyCatcher-IL-5 and 
2xSpyTag-VLP (193 antigens per VLP) compared with 
mixing similar amounts of SpyCatcher-IL-5 with SpyTag-
VLP (138 antigens per VLP) (Table 1; Additional file 3: 
Figure S2D).
Immunogenicity of spy‑VLP vaccines
To assess the immunogenicity of spy-VLP delivered anti-
gens, we tested two clinically relevant malaria proteins, 
Pfs25 and VAR2CSA, and evaluated humoral responses 
in mice after intramuscular immunizations. Pfs25 is 
expressed on the P. falciparum ookinete surface within 
the mosquito. Immunization with recombinant Pfs25 
formulated in Montanide ISA51 induced Pfs25-specific 
antibodies with capacity to block parasite infectivity to 
mosquitoes in a Phase 1 human clinical trial but the vac-
cine had unacceptable side effects [20]. The Pfs25 antigen 
is poorly immunogenic by itself and development of an 
effective transmission-blocking Pfs25 vaccine has been 
hampered by the requirement of a strong adjuvant [20–
22]. SpyCatcher was fused to the C-terminus of Pfs25 and 
Pfs25-SpyCatcher was expressed and purified from E. coli 
SHuffle® cells. This enabled high level expression of solu-
ble correctly folded Pfs25-SpyCatcher as verified by bind-
ing of the transmission-blocking anti-Pfs25 monoclonal 
antibody, mAb 4B7 [23] (Additional file 4: Figure S3).
VAR2CSA is a unique member of the P. falciparum 
erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) protein fam-
ily. This protein binds parasite-infected erythrocytes 
to placental chrondroitin sulphate A (CSA) [24]. Anti-
VAR2CSA antibodies can prevent this binding [25, 26], 
and clinical testing of a protein-based VAR2CSA vac-
cine to protect women against placental malaria has 
been initiated [27]. SpyTag was genetically fused to the 
N-terminus of the CSA binding domain of VAR2CSA 
(domains DBL1-ID2a) and expressed and purified from 
E. coli SHuffle® cells. The protein expressed well and was 
folded correctly as measured by its binding to decorin, as 
described in [28].
Spy‑VLP vaccine induced IgG titers
The antigen display capacities for Pfs25 and VAR2CSA 
were 109 and 61 proteins per VLP, respectively (Table 1; 
Additional file 3: Figure S2C, K). The antigen-specific 
IgG titer was measured by enzyme-linked immune-sorb-
ent assay (ELISA) 2 weeks after each immunization (on 
days 14, 35 and 56) as well as at day 212 (Pfs25) and 137 
(VAR2CSA) (Fig. 2a). The Pfs25 spy-VLP vaccine induced 
higher antigen-specific IgG titers than the control vac-
cine at all the tested time-points (P < 0.01 (day 14, 35 and 
56); P = 0.03 (day 212), Mann–Whitney Rank Sum Test) 
(Fig. 2a). At day 212, there was a 37-fold increase in the 
geometric mean titer (GMT) of IgG in sera from spy-
VLP vaccinated mice compared to mice vaccinated with 
the same amount of soluble Pfs25 plus untagged AP205 
VLPs.

The GMT of VAR2CSA-specific IgG was consistently 
higher in the group immunized with the VAR2CSA spy-
VLP vaccine compared to the control group vaccinated 
with uncoupled VAR2CSA. However, the difference in 
GMTs between the two groups was not as profound as 
seen in the Pfs25 study and only reached statistical sig-
nificance at days 14 (P = 0.03, Mann–Whitney Rank Sum 
Test) and 137 (P = 0.03, Mann–Whitney Rank Sum Test) 
(Fig. 2a).
Avidity of spy‑VLP vaccine induced IgG
In order to further examine qualitative differences in 
humoral responses, we investigated the avidity of IgG 
antibodies induced after immunizations with spy-VLP 
vaccines compared to control vaccines (uncoupled anti-
gen + untagged AP205 VLPs). The avidity index val-
ues of serum IgG were determined by measuring the 
resistance of antibody-antigen complexes to 8 M urea 
by ELISA, as described [29]. Avidity index values can 
be divided into three categories denoting: high avidity 
(avidity index values higher than 50 %), intermediate 
avidity (between 30 and 50 %) and low avidity (>30 %) 
[29]. Prior to measuring avidity, pre-determined IgG 
antibody levels in individual mouse serum samples were 
equalized by dilution. Both the Pfs25 and VAR2CSA 
spy-VLP vaccines induced antigen-specific IgG with sig-
nificantly higher avidity-index values compared to cor-
responding control vaccines P = 0.015 (Pfs25 day 35) 
and P = 0.032 (Pfs25 day 56) and P = 0.032 (VAR2CSA 
day 35) and P = 0.056 (VAR2CSA day 56), Mann–Whit-
ney Rank Sum Test) Fig. 2b. The mean avidity index 
value of anti-Pfs25 sera obtained at day 35 was 46 % for 
the spy-VLP group, thus falling within the “intermediate 
avidity” category, whereas the mean value of the control 
group was only 22 % (i.e. low avidity). The correspond-
ing values for day 56 were 57 % (i.e. high avidity) and 
30 % (i.e. intermediate avidity) for the spy-VLP and con-
trol group, respectively. The mean avidity of antibodies 
induced by the VAR2CSA spy-VLP vaccine was 63 and 
62 % (both high avidity) in sera obtained at day 35 and 
56, respectively. In comparison, mean avidity of anti-
bodies induced by the control vaccine was 39 and 42 % 
(both intermediate avidity) in sera obtained at day 35 
and 56, respectively.
Subclass profiling of vaccine induced IgG
The relative proportion of IgG subclasses elicited in the 
spy-VLP vaccinated groups and the control groups was 
also compared. Measurements were performed on sera 
obtained at day 98 (Pfs25) or 88 (VAR2CSA) and cal-
culations were based on ELISA measurements using 
subclass-specific (IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b) secondary 
anti-mouse IgG antibodies for quantification. Anti-
mouse total IgG secondary antibody was used for nor-
malization. IgG1 was the dominant IgG subclass in all 
sera. Sera from Pfs25 vaccinated mice contained IgG1 
and IgG2b and the spy-VLP vaccine induced significantly 
higher IgG2b (P = 0.03) and significantly lower (P = 0.03) 
IgG1 levels compared to the control vaccine (Fig. 2c, left). 
Sera from VAR2CSA vaccinated mice contained IgG 
of all subclasses. The distribution of IgG subclasses was 
similar in mice vaccinated with the two VAR2CSA vac-
cines. (Fig. 2c, right).
Functional activity of spy‑VLP induced humoral responses
For most vaccines only a fraction of the induced IgG is 
biologically active in inhibiting the development of the 
targeted microorganism and the level and overall avid-
ity of vaccine induced IgG responses does not necessarily 
reflect the anti-microbial functional activity. The goal of 
the Pfs-25 vaccine is to block parasite development inside 
the mosquito. We therefore used the standard membrane 
feeding assay (SMFA) to measure transmission-blocking 
(TB) activity of the antibodies induced by the two vac-
cines [30]. The Pfs25 spy-VLP vaccine showed more than 
99 % transmission-reducing activity (TRA) (one oocyst 
found in the 20 investigated mosquitos) compared to 
pre-immune serum (82 oocysts detected) or serum from 
See figure on previous page.)

(Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark). Mice were immunized on days 0, 21 and 42 and serum was collected on the indicated days after 
first immunization. Differences in median endpoint titers between vaccination groups were analyzed using Mann–Whitney Rank Sum test; day 
14 (P < 0.01), day 35 (P < 0.01), day 56 (P < 0.01) and day 212 (P = 0.03). (a, lower panels) Similar results for the VAR2CSA based vaccines (VAR2CSA 
SpyCactcher‑VLP and soluble VAR2CSA plus untagged AP205 VLP), which were formulated without extrinsic adjuvant. Statistical analysis; day 14 
(P = 0.03), day 35 (P = 0.09), day 56 (P = 0.09) and day 137 (P = 0.03). b Antibody avidity was assessed on days 35 and 56 in serum samples from 
mice vaccinated with the Pfs25 or VAR2CSA vaccines. Avidity index values were determined by measuring the resistance of antibody‑antigen com‑
plexes to 8 M urea. The avidity index was calculated as the ratio of the mean ELISA OD490 value of urea‑treated wells to PBS control wells multiplied 
by 100. Mann–Whitney Rank Sum test was used for statistical comparisons. c The distribution of IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b relative to the total vaccine‑

on days 98 and 88, respectively. Mann–Whitney Rank Sum test was used for statistical comparisons

mice immunized with the control vaccine (85 oocysts 
detected) (Fig. 3a). In a second study, BALB/c mice 
(n = 7) were immunized with the Pfs25 spy-VLP vaccine 
at days 0 and 14, and different concentrations of purified 
IgG from pooled anti-Pfs25 serum samples were subse-
quently tested in the SMFA assay. At the highest IgG con-
centration (750 µg/ml) serum from the Pfs25 spy-VLP 
vaccinated mice completely blocked oocyst formation 
(Table 2).
Serum concentrations of 250 and 83.3 µg/ml showed 
more than 95 % transmission-reducing activity com-
pared to IgG purified from ovalbumin immunized mice 
(Table 2).
The aim of VAR2CSA vaccines is to induce IgG, which 
inhibit the binding between parasite-infected erythro-
cytes and placental chondroitin sulfate. We therefore 
compared the vaccines ability to elicit IgG inhibiting 
the binding between VAR2CSA expressed on infected 
erythrocytes and chondroitin sulfate in an in vitro assay 
(Fig. 3b). The mean EC50 calculated from the dose–
response curve of serum from VAR2CSA spy-VLP immu-
nized mice was eightfold higher, [CI 95 % 3.213–14.41], 
than the mean EC50 in serum from mice vaccinated with 
VAR2CSA that was not bound to VLPs (Fig. 3b).
Breaking self‑tolerance by spy‑VLP display
To examine the capacity of the spy-VLP system to over-
come B cell self-tolerance and induce autoantibody 
responses upon vaccination with self-antigens, mouse 
proteins PD-L1, CTLA-4 and interleukin-5 were recom-
binantly expressed with SpyTag or SpyCatcher and 
formulated as spy-VLP vaccines. PD-L1 and CTLA-4 
down regulate T cell function. Expression of these pro-
teins in tumors has been linked to poor prognosis and

antibody-targeting of the proteins is showing promise 
in cancer treatment [31]. Antibody measurements of 
anti-sera obtained at day 56 showed that the PD-L1 and 
CTLA-4 spy-VLP vaccines induced significant antibody 
responses against the self-antigens compared to the solu-
ble protein (P = 0.01 and P < 0.01, respectively) (Fig. 4a, 
b).
The therapeutic use in severe asthma of antibodies tar-
geting IL-5 is supported by abundant data from in vitro 
experiments, animal models and clinical trials [32]. The 
SpyCatcher was fused at the N-terminus of mouse IL-5. 
Antibody measurements of anti-IL-5 in sera obtained 
at day 56 showed that the spy-VLP vaccine induced sig-
nificant antibody responses against this self-antigen 
compared to the control vaccine (P = 0.02) (Fig. 4c). 
The autoantibody response elicited by the spy-VLP 
vaccine did not decay rapidly as the titers measured at 
day 112 (Fig. 4d) were similar to those measured at day 56 
(P = 0.02) (Fig. 4c).
Mixing SpyCatcher-IL-5 with 2xSpyTag-VLPs resulted 
in a higher antigen coupling capacity than when mixing 
the same antigen with SpyTag-VLPs (Table 1; Additional 
file 3: Figure S2D). These two mixtures were adminis-
tered to mice to compare IgG levels elicited by the two 
vaccines. The GMT titer of sera obtained at day 35 from 
mice vaccinated with the IL-5 2xSpyTag-VLP vaccine 
(GMT = 580) was 13 fold higher than for the anti-IL-5 
SpyTag-VLP sera (GMT = 41) (P = 0.06, Mann–Whit-
ney Rank Sum test), suggesting that the increased anti-
gen coupling capacity of the 2xSpyTag VLP had an effect 
on the immunogenicity of the vaccine (Additional file 5: 
Figure S4).

antigen mixed with untagged AP205 VLPs (open squares). Both vaccines were formulated using aluminum hydroxide adjuvant (Statens Serum Insti‑
tut, Copenhagen, Denmark). Mice were immunized with a dose of 5 µg antigen on days 0, 21 and 42 and serum was collected on day 56 after first 
immunization. Median endpoint titers were compared for the PD‑L1 vaccination groups (P = 0.01) and the CTLA‑4 vaccination groups (P = 0.01) 
using Mann–Whitney Rank Sum test. c, d BALB/c mice (n = 4) were immunized with an IL‑5 SpyTag‑VLP vaccine or a control vaccine (soluble 
IL‑5 + untagged AP205 VLP) (n = 5) which were both formulated with aluminum hydroxide (Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark). Mice 
were immunized on days 0, 21 and 42 with antigen doses of 5, 2.5 and 2.5 µg, respectively, and serum was collected on days 56 (c) and 112 (d). 
Median endpoint titers for the two vaccination groups were compared using Mann–Whitney Rank Sum test; day 56 (P = 0.2) and day 122 (P = 0.2)

Discussion
Virus-like particles (VLPs) are effective at establish-
ing both prophylactic and therapeutic immunity against 
their source virus or foreign antigens displayed on their 
surface. Aiming at developing a versatile VLP-based anti-
gen display platform, we designed a panel of genetically 
modified spy-AP205 coat proteins, which assembled into 
stable, non-aggregated VLPs presenting reactive SpyTag 
or SpyCatcher on their surfaces. The Acinetobacter phage 
AP205 was chosen as platform as AP205 VLPs have been 
shown to tolerate fusion of heterologous peptides at both 
the N- and C-terminus of the structural protein [17] 
and because AP205 VLPs can be produced at low cost 
in E. coli. The spy-VLPs were assessed in terms of their 
applicability to bind and display antigens using the Spy-
Catcher/SpyTag conjugation system [16]. This protein-
coupling tool offers several key advantages. SpyTag and 
SpyCatcher polypeptides react and form an irreversible 
isopeptide bond at high yield under a variety of condi-
tions (including variation in pH, temperature or buffer 
composition) [16], which offer ample possibilities for 
antigen-specific optimization. We have previously expe-
rienced that antigen-VLP conjugates tend to form aggre-
gates and precipitate upon mixing of antigen and VLP. 
Subsequent modification of buffer conditions can pre-
vent this while still allowing efficient conjugation (data 
not shown). Notably, a similar split-intein conjugation 
system (Snooptag/SnoopCatcher) was recently reported, 
which may be used in a similar strategy for conjugation of 
antigen to pre-assembled VLPs [33].
Having developed both SpyTag and SpyCatcher fused 
VLPs; either binding partner can be chosen as fusion-tag 
to the antigen. In most cases the SpyTag peptide will be 
the preferred choice since the minor addition of 13 amino 
acid residues to the antigen is unlikely to negatively influ-
ence protein expression or polypeptide folding, which in 
turn could have impact on the functional capacity of elic-
ited IgG. Interestingly, for several proteins, we observed 
increased expression yields after fusing the SpyCatcher 
to the antigen, creating an additional rational for employ-
ing SpyTag-VLPs for conjugation of SpyCatcher-fused 
antigens. Specifically, we were able to express soluble and 
correctly folded Pfs25-SpyCatcher using E. coli SHuffle® 
(NEB Biolabs) strains. Notably, E. coli expression of solu-
ble Pfs25, in functional conformation, has not previously 
been reported [34] and expression of naked Pfs25 using 
similar E. coli SHuffle® cells resulted, in our hands, in for-
mation of inclusion bodies (data not shown).
Epitope density is an important factor for B cell acti-
vation [35]. It was thus interesting to examine whether 
the spy-VLP system presented vaccine antigens at high 
density. The VLPs formed by structural proteins to which 
one SpyTag or SpyCatcher were fused provided 180 
binding sites per VLP. We tested 11 spy-antigens in dif-
ferent combinations with these spy-VLP platforms. The 
antigen density per particle varied according to antigen 
and the VLP employed, but the mean display capacity 
was 118 antigen molecules per spy-VLP, corresponding 
to that antigens had been coupled to 65 % of the available 
VLP subunits. We had expected antigen-specific char-
acteristics (e.g. net surface charge) would have a greater 
effect on the coupling efficiency than what was observed, 
but the observed correlation between antigen size and 
the density of antigen display on the VLPs, suggests that 
steric hindrance plays a role. The VLPs with 180 available 
antigen binding sites elicited robust IgG responses, how-
ever we also designed VLPs where each subunit protein 
had two SpyTags attached. These VLPs had 360 binding 
sites available. The immunogenicity of IL-5 was higher 
when administrered with the high density VLP (193 anti-
gens coupled per VLP) than with the lower density VLP 
(138 antigens coupled per VLP), but the difference only 
achieved borderline statistical significance (P = 0.06). 
Due to close proximity of the SpyTags on the VLPs with 
360 binding sites it is likely that smaller proteins are bet-
ter able to bind effectively to these particles, whereas 
larger proteins face problems of steric hindrance. Thus 
each of the three developed spy-VLP platforms contrib-
utes to the versatility of the antigen display system.
The long-term success of a Pfs25-based transmis-
sion-blocking vaccine depends upon induction of high 
and sustainable levels of functional antibody that effec-
tively block parasite development in the mosquito [36, 
37]. In this regard, a single immunization with bivalent 
HPV16/18 L1 VLP vaccine (Cervarix) has been shown 
to induce protective antibody levels remaining stable for 
more than 48 months [38]. This has been attributed to 
the ordered, repetitive, and dense display of epitopes on 
the VLP surface. We found, that the immunogenicity of 
Pfs25 on spy-VLPs was high and that the anti-Pfs25 IgG 
levels was considerably higher 6 months post immuniza-
tion compared to mice vaccinated with uncoupled pro-
tein, although IgG levels showed a tendency to decline 
throughout the study period. Further long-term studies 
are thus needed to establish if anti-Pfs25 levels will even-
tually plateau and, in that event, assay the transmission-
blocking activity of the remaining antigen-specific IgG.
Anti-VAR2CSA IgG titers were not boosted to the 
same extent by the spy-VLP display as seen in the Pfs25 
study. Likely, this is explained by the fact that soluble 
VAR2CSA is a superior immunogen i.e. the soluble pro-
tein induced relatively high antigen specific IgG titers. 
However, the comparably lower antigen display capacity 
of the VAR2CSA spy-VLP vaccine (61 antigens per VLP) 
may also have limited immunogenicity. Importantly, a 
vaccine to protect against placental malaria should be 
 Page 10 of 16
Thrane et al. J Nanobiotechnol  (2016) 14:30 
administered prior to conception i.e. to pre-puberty girls. 
Therefore, several years are likely to lapse between vac-
cination and exposure. It is thus important to note that 
anti-VAR2CSA IgG titers were significantly higher in 
the spy-VLP immunized group compared to the control 
when examining serum samples obtained at day 137.
VLP display had a significant positive effect on the 
avidity of the humoral response against both Pfs25 and 
VAR2CSA. The avidity index values determined for anti-
Pfs25 IgG in sera from mice immunized with soluble 
Pfs25 formulated in aluminum hydroxide were catego-
rized as “low” to “intermediate” affinity whereas IgG in 
corresponding serum samples from Pfs25 spy-VLP immu-
nized mice were categorized as “high affinity”
. The avidity 
of anti-VAR2CSA IgG was also higher after vaccination 
with VLPs compared to vaccination with uncoupled pro-
tein. This might be of importance since the avidity of 
anti-VAR2CSA IgG has been associated with protection 
against placental malaria [39]. This might seem somewhat 
surprising as one might predict that VLP display could 
lower the average avidity of induced antibodies since the 
multivalent interaction of the displayed antigen with B 
cell receptors would lead to activation of lower affinity B 
cells. However, the ability of virus-like display to break B 
cell peripheral self-tolerance and activate anergic B cells, 
perhaps via signaling through IgD, may contribute to the 
observed higher avidity. These activities would permit the 
generation of antibody secreting plasmablasts through 
tolerized naïve B cells and self-reactive intermediates gen-
erated during somatic hypermutation and this would not 
be the case with monomeric antigen. This situation could 
result in a more diverse antibody repertoire that would 
drive selection of higher affinity clones [40–42].
Comparison of IgG subclasses revealed a significantly 
(2–2.5 fold) higher induction of anti-Pfs25 IgG2b in Pfs25 
spy-VLP vaccinated mice compared to the control group 
(such a difference was not observed in the VAR2CSA 
study). In mice, IgG1 is associated with a T-helper cell 
type 2 (Th2)-like response, while a Th1 response is asso-
ciated with the induction of IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG3 
antibodies [43]. IgG2b (and IgG2a) exhibit the strongest 
binding to Fc receptors [44] and has a higher capacity for 
complement fixation than IgG1 [45]. Both Pfs25 vaccines 
were formulated in aluminum hydroxide (Statens Serum 
Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark), which is a known stim-
ulator of Th2 responses. It is interesting that the Pfs25 
spy-VLP vaccine was able to induce a significantly higher 
IgG2b level, indicating a boosted Th1 response. The IgG 
subclasses can contribute to clearance of pathogens by 
different mechanisms. Accordingly, the induction of a 
broad subclass and a balanced Th1/Th2 response might 
be desirable for some vaccines. AP205 VLPs expressed 
in E. coli contain host cell RNA, which can activate the 
innate immune system via TLR 7 and 8. Besides, endo-
toxin levels were not measured in the VLP prepara-
tions. It is thus a possibility that bacterial RNA and/or 
endotoxins have affected the profile of IgG subclasses 
induced by the spy-VLP and unconjugated control vac-
cine, respectively.
For Pfs25, the spy-VLP vaccine was far more potent 
than the vaccine based on soluble protein in the ability 
to elicit biologically functional antibodies. Indeed when 
our results are benchmarked against other Pfs25 vacci-
nation studies the tested Pfs25 spy-VLP vaccine shows 
state-of-the-art efficacy [34, 46, 47]. Similar findings were 
observed for VAR2CSA, the functional parasite binding-
inhibition assay showed an eight fold higher parasite 
binding-inhibition capacity in sera from spy-VLP vacci-
nated mice compared to control sera. In conclusion, the 
results of the Pfs25 and VAR2CSA immunization studies 
demonstrate proof-of-concept for the spy-VLP system to 
increase the functional antibody responses to complex 
vaccine antigens.
Display of self-antigens on VLPs is an effective 
approach for inducing strong antibody responses against 
self-antigens providing opportunities for development of 
therapeutic VLP-based vaccines [48–50]. We thus exam-
ined if the spy-VLP system was efficient in breaking self-
tolerance. These studies, based on both cancer (PD-L1 
and CTLA-4) and allergy (IL-5) associated self-antigen 
targets, demonstrated a consistent ability of the spy-VLP 
mediated antigen-display to facilitate induction of potent 
autoantibody responses. Previously, VLP-display induced 
autoantibody responses have been reported to wane over 
time with a typical half-life in humans and non-human 
primates of ~3 months [51–53] and there has been no 
evidence for boosting by endogenous self-antigen, prob-
ably since foreign T cell helper responses are required 
to stimulate antibody production. It is thus interesting 
that our IL-5 spy-VLP vaccine induced antigen-specific 
autoantibody titers, which did not show a significant 
decline over a period of 4 months post immunization.
Reporting work, done in parallel and unknown to us, 
Brune et al. recently published on the development of 
a SpyCatcher-AP205 VLP, which was used in a similar 
strategy to ours to develop VLP-vaccines based on two 
malaria antigens (Pfs25 and CIDR) [54]. In that study, 
proof-of-principle was established alone by showing 
increased antigen-specific IgG titers in sera obtained 
approximately 2 weeks after immunization of mice with 
the spy-VLP vaccines compared to a control vaccine. Our 
study extends these results by presenting different spy-
VLP platforms, which are each used to characterize the 
systems versatility for antigen display. Furthermore, spy-
VLP-induced responses in mice were analyzed over sev-
eral months and included measurement of antibody titer,

avidity and subclass distribution. Finally, we demonstrate 
proof-of-concept for the spy-VLP system to increase 
functional antibody responses against different pathogen 
antigens as wells as to overcome B cell self-tolerance.
The requirement of simple subunit-based vaccines 
to be administered with an extrinsic adjuvant, of which 
only a few have been approved for human use [55], is 
an impediment for vaccine development. VLP-display 
of vaccine antigens might mitigate this requirement and 
enable development of adjuvant-free vaccines. A generic 
VLP-display platform may moreover be instrumental for 
screening of vaccine candidate antigens since especially 
low-immunogenic or cryptic antigens (e.g. Pfs25, HPV 
L2, PfRH5) depend greatly on increased immunogenicity 
for their protective potential. The ability of the spy-VLP 
system to display whole antigens enables induction of 
polyclonal antibody responses, which may have a supe-
rior neutralizing capacity compared to the essentially 
monoclonal responses induced by epitope-based vac-
cines. Finally, the simple production of VLP vaccines that 
have been made possible by the versatile spy-VLP system 
raises the possibility that the spy-VLPs could be pre-
manufactured and distributed as a generic tool for use in 
laboratories working on vaccine development against a 
wide variety of target antigens.
Methods
Design, expression and purification of spy‑AP205 virus‑like 
particles
The Acinetobacter phage AP205 coat protein (Gene 
ID: 956335) was used to design three “spy-VLPs”
, pre-
senting either SpyTag or SpyCatcher on their surface. 
SpyTag-VLP was constructed by adding the SpyTag 
peptide sequence (AHIVMVDAYKPTK) to N-termi-
nus of the AP205 coat protein. 2xSpyTag-VLP had the 
SpyTag added to both the N- and C-terminus of the 
AP205 coat protein. SpyCatcher-VLP had the Spy-
Catcher protein added to the N-terminus of AP205 coat 
protein. The constructs were all designed to contain a 
flexible linker between the binding tag and the AP205 
coat protein; GSGTAGGGSGS (SpyTag-VLP), GGSGS 
(SpyCatcher-VLP), GSGTAGGGSGS (N-terminus of 
2xSpyTag-VLP) and GTASGGSGGSG (C-terminus of 
2xSpyTag-VLP). Gene sequences were further modified 
to contain NcoI and NotI restriction sites at the N- and 
C-termini, respectively, and were codon-optimized for 
recombinant expression in E. coli before being synthe-
sized by (GeneArt® Life Technologies, Germany). All 
spy-VLP expression sequences were cloned into a pET-
15b vector and transformed into One Shot® BL21 Star™ 
(DE3) (Thermo Scientific) cells. Transformed colonies 
were screened by small-scale (10 mL) protein expres-
sion followed by SDS-PAGE analysis to identify the 
transformed clones with the highest level of protein 
expression. Expression was done in 3L shake flasks con-
taining 400 mL 2xYT media (100 µg/mL ampicillin). 
Bacterial cultures were incubated for approximately 3 h 
(OD600 = 0.6) at 37 °C before they were induced with 
1 mM IPTG and then allowed to incubated for additional 
16 h at 20 °C. Cultures were harvested by centrifuga-
tion (10,000g) and pellets were resuspended in 1xPBS 
(pH = 7.2) and lysed by sonication at 80 % power with 5 
pulsations for 2 × 5 min on ice. Cleared bacterial lysates 
were then purified by ultracentrifugation (UC) through 
an Optiprep™ (Sigma) step (23, 29 and 35 %) gradient, 
modified from [56]. In brief, 1.2 ml bacterial lysate was 
loaded on top of the gradient in Polyallomer Centrifuge 
open top tubes (11 × 60 mm) (Bechmann Coulter) and 
spun at 307.900 RCF (SW60Ti rotor, Beckmann Coul-
ter) for 3.30 h at 16 °C. UC fractions were subsequently 
analyses by SDS-PAGE and VLP-containing fractions 
were pooled and dialyzed in PBS (0.02 % PS80, pH 7.2) 
using a 300.000 MWCO membrane (Spectrum). Dialyzed 
VLP samples were finally spun down at 16,000g for 2 min 
at 4 °C to remove aggregates. Protein concentration was 
determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (Sigma), follow-
ing manufacturer’s instructions.
Electron microscopy
Using the droplet method, an aliquot of VLPs was diluted 
to 0.2 mg/mL in PBS. Diluted VLPs were adsorbed to 
carbon and negatively stained with 2 % phosphotungstic 
acid (pH = 7.0) for 1 min. A grid was placed on the car-
bon floating on top of the 2 % phosphotungstic acid stain 
droplet. Excess stain was removed with filter paper. The 
sample was examined with a CM 100 BioTWIN electron 
microscope (Phillips) at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. 
Photographic records were obtained on an Olympus 
Veleta camera.
Particle size measurement by dynamic light scattering 
(DLS)
VLPs were diluted to 0.2 mg/mL in PBS and spun at 
15,000g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove aggregates. 70 µl 
of each VLP sample was loaded into disposable low vol-
ume cuvettes and mounted into the DLS chamber. Size 
distribution was obtained by DLS measurements at 25 °C 
using WYATT Technology, DynaPro NanoStar, equipped 
with a 658 nm laser. Each sample was measured twice 
with 20 runs. The mean size of the most predominant 
particles in the population was calculated together with 
the % polydispersity (% Pd).
Design, expression and purification of spy‑antigen
All vaccine constructs were designed with a VLP bind-
ing-tag (SpyCatcher or SpyTag) and a hexa histidine 
 Page 12 of 16
Thrane et al. J Nanobiotechnol  (2016) 14:30 
purification tag at opposite termini of the antigen. A flex-
ible serine/glycine linker was inserted between the spy 
binding-tag and the antigen. Gene sequences codon-opti-
mized for expression in E. coli were modified to contain 
NcoI and NotI restriction sites at the N- and C-termi-
nus, respectively. Gene sequences codon-optimized for 
expression in Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells were 
designed with BamHI and NotI restriction sites at the 
N- and C-terminus, respectively. All sequences were syn-
thesized by (GeneArt® Life Technologies, Germany). A 
complete list of antigens used in this study is shown in 
(Additional file 2: Table S1). For expression in E. coli One 
Shot® BL21 Star™ (DE3) (Thermo Scientific) or SHuf-
fle® T7 Express (C3029H New England BioLabs) cells, 
gene sequences were cloned in into a pET-15b vector 
and expressed, as described previously (see Expression 
and purification of spy-AP205 virus-like particles). For 
expression in baculovirus-transfected insect cells gene 
fragments were cloned into the BamHI/NotI sites of the 
pAcGP67A vector (BD Biosciences). To generate recom-
binant virus particles, linearized BakPak viral DNA (BD 
Biosciences) was co-transfected with pAcGP67A/Avi-L1 
into Sf9 insect cells using Lipofectamine 2000 10 Rea-
gent (Invitrogen, 11668–019) and incubated at 28 °C for 
3–5 days. Recombinant baculovirus was harvested from 
the supernatant and used to generate a high-titer virus 
stock, which was used for infection of High-Five insect 
cells. Infected High-Five cells were incubated for 48 h 
at 28 °C with shaking. Expression in S2 insect cells were 
done as previously described [57].
Conjugation of vaccine antigens to VLPs
To attach vaccine antigen to VLPs, spy-VLPs and spy-
antigen were incubated overnight at 4 °C at a 1:1.5 M 
ratio. Antigen and VLPs were mixed in a standard phos-
phate-buffered saline buffer supplemented with 0.2 % 
Polysorbate 80, pH 7.2. To prevent aggregation/precipi-
tation of the antigen-VLP conjugate it was sometimes 
necessary to optimize buffer conditions by adjusting the 
pH and/or ionic strength of the buffer (PD-L1 VLP vac-
cine was mixed in PBS, 0.8 M NaCl, pH 6.2). Coupling 
efficiencies reported in Table 1 were estimated by den-
sitometric analysis of SDS-PAGE gels (Additional file 3: 
Figure S2) using ImageQuant TL software. The percent-
age of VLP subunits, which had been conjugated to an 
antigen via interaction between SpyTag and SpyCatcher 
(% coupling efficiency), was estimated by dividing the 
intensity value of the VLP subunit protein band before 
reaction with antigen with the corresponding intensity 
value after reaction with antigen, multiplied with 100. 
This percentage was subsequently multiplied by 180 or 
360 to calculate the antigen-display capacity (number of 
antigens/VLP).
Immunization of mice
Mice were immunized with the described VLP vaccines 
or control vaccines prepared in a similar way as the VLP 
vaccines, but where the Spy-tagged vaccine antigens 
were incubated with untagged AP205 VLPs. Thus, the 
only difference between the VLP vaccines and the con-
trol vaccines was that vaccine antigens were coupled to 
the VLPs in the VLP vaccines, whereas the control vac-
cines contained soluble vaccine antigen and uncoupled 
VLPs. Stock solutions of spy-VLPs contained 1 mg/ml 
spy-AP205 protein and were estimated by SDS-PAGE 
to be >95 % pure. All vaccines, except the VAR2CSA 
based vaccines, were formulated with 2 % Alhydrogel 
(Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark) to a 
final concentration of 2 mg/ml aluminum hydroxide. The 
Alhydrogel was added 1 h prior to intramuscular immu-
nization (50 µL/mice). The VAR2CSA vaccines were 
diluted with PBS and administrated without adjuvant. 
The indicated vaccine dose refers solely to the amount 
of antigen. Vaccines were administered on days 0, 21 and 
42. Blood samples were obtained 2 weeks after the first, 
second and third immunizations. Additional blood sam-
ples were collected according to the vaccine antigen as 
follows: Pfs25 vaccines on days 98 and 212; VAR2CSA 
vaccines on days 88 and 137; IL-5 vaccines on day 112. 
BALB/c mice were used for the VAR2CSA and IL-5 
immunization studies as well as for generating anti-
Pfs25 sera used in the SMFA study testing different IgG 
concentrations (Table 2). C57/BL6 mice were used in the 
CTLA-4 and PD-L1 study as well as in the other Pfs25 
immunization study (Figs. 2, 3).
Antibody response measured by standard ELISA
Serum IgG levels were measured by standard enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 96-well plates 
(Nunc MaxiSorp) were coated over night at 4 °C with 
vaccine protein, without SpyTag or SpyCatcher com-
ponent, (1 µg/ml in PBS). Plates were blocked with 1 % 
BSA buffer for 1 h at room temperature (RT). Mouse 
serum diluted 1:100 in blocking buffer were added in 
three-fold dilutions to triplicate wells and incubated for 
1 h at RT. Plates were washed three times in PBS with 
0.05 % TWEEN 20 in between different steps. Horserad-
ish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-
mouse IgG (A16072, Life Technologies, Denmark) was 
diluted 1:3000 in blocking buffer and incubated for 1 h. 
Finally, color reactions were developed for 7 min by add-
ing o-phenylenediamine substrate. The HRP enzymatic 
reaction was terminated by addition of 2.5 M H2SO4 
and the optical density was measured at 490 nm using 
an ELISA plate reader (VersaMax Molecular Devices). 
Serum IgG endpoint titers were estimated using a cutoff
 
of OD490 = 0.2.

Serum IgG subclass profiling by ELISA
IgG subclass profiling of anti-Pfs25 and anti-VAR2CSA 
mouse sera followed a standard ELISA protocol, as 
described above. However, serum IgG levels were first 
normalized based on pre-determined ELISA OD490 val-
ues by dilution. Subsequent to incubation of IgG-nor-
malized serum samples, secondary HRP-conjugated 
antibodies were used for detection of total mouse IgG 
(A16072, Life Technologies, Denmark) along with 
mouse IgG subclasses; IgG1 (A10551, Thermo Fisher), 
IgG2a (M32307, Thermo Fisher) and IgG2b (M32507, 
Thermo Fischer). For each serum sample, the OD490 
value obtained by detection with subclass-specific anti-
mouse IgG secondary antibodies was divided by the 
OD490 obtained by detection with anti-mouse total IgG 
secondary antibody. These relative measures were finally 
used for comparison of IgG subclass profiles in anti-Pfs25 
and anti-VAR2CSA sera from spy-VLP immunized and 
mice vaccinated by the uncoupled soluble protein control 
vaccines.
Measuring avidity of serum IgG
Recombinant Pfs25 or VAR2CSA (1 µg/ml in PBS) was 
coated on Nunc MaxiSorp plates overnight at 4 °C. Plates 
were incubated with blocking buffer (1 % BSA) for 1 h at 
room temperature (RT). Plates were washed three times 
in between different steps. Before adding the anti-sera for 
incubation with the capture antigen, IgG levels in individ-
ual serum samples were equalized by dilution. This was 
done based on pre-determined OD490 ELISA values. IgG-
normalized serum samples were added (50 µl per well) to 
the ELISA plate in triplicates, and incubated for 1 h at RT. 
The ELISA wells were subsequently washed three times 
in PBS with 0.05 % TWEEN 20 and 50 µl of freshly made 
8 M Urea was then added to the wells for 5 min (reference 
plates were incubated with PBS). ELISA plates were then 
washed three times with PBS (0.05 % TWEEN 20). HRP-
conjugated polyclonal goat anti-mouse IgG (A16072, Life 
Technologies, Denmark) was diluted 1:3000 in blocking 
buffer and incubated for 1 h. Finally, color reactions were 
developed for 7 min by adding o-phenylenediamine sub-
strate. The HRP enzymatic reaction was stopped by add-
ing 2.5 M H2SO4 and the optical density was measured at 
490 nm using an ELISA plate reader (VersaMax Molecu-
lar Devices). IgG avidity index values were calculated as 
the ratio of the mean OD value of urea-treated wells to 
PBS control wells multiplied by 100.
Purification of IgG from anti‑Pfs25 mouse serum
Total IgG was purified using Protein G columns (Pierce, 
USA) from anti-Pfs25 mouse serum samples. Briefly, 
protein G columns were equilibrated with binding 
buffer (Immunopure IgG, Pierce, USA) after which a 1:1 
mixture of sera and binding buffer was allowed to flow 
through under gravity, the columns were then washed 
and eluted with elution buffer (Immunopure IgG, Pierce, 
USA). The eluted fraction was collected in 1 M Tris–
HCl (pH 9.0, Teknova, USA) and transferred for buffer 
exchange to Amicon centrifugal filters (Millipore, USA) 
using PBS. The eluent was concentrated in PBS (Invitro-
gen, UK) and filtered using a 0.22 μm Millipore Ultrafree 
sterile centrifugal unit.
Standard Membrane‑Feeding Assay (SMFA)
Two independent SMFA analyses were performed. The 
first SMFA analysis was done to compare the transmis-
sion blocking (TB) activity of anti-Pfs25 sera obtained by 
immunization of mice with the Pfs25 spy-VLP vaccine 
or with the corresponding control vaccine. This SMFA 
experiment was conducted as previously described [30, 
58]. Briefly, 30 μl of mouse serum obtained at day 56 was 
mixed with 90 μl of naïve human serum and 150 μl of 
in vitro gametocyte cultures of the P. falciparum (NF54) 
laboratory line. The mixture was fed to Anopheles ste-
phensi mosquitoes through a membrane feeding appara-
tus. Pre-immune sera served as controls. Fully engorged 
mosquitoes were separated and held at 26 °C. Seven 
days later, midguts of 20 mosquitoes were examined for 
oocysts. The observed transmission reducing activity of 
serum was determined as the percentage reduction in the 
median oocyst number in test samples compared to that 
in controls. The experiment was considered valid when 
at least 85 % of the mosquitoes feeding on control sera 
were infected. The other SMFA study, testing different 
concentrations of IgG purified from anti-Pfs25 spy-VLP 
mouse sera, was done as described [59]. Briefly, mature 
P. falciparum strain NF54 Stage V gametocytes (adjusted 
to parasiteamia of 0.15 %  ±  0.05 %) were mixed with dif-
ferent concentrations of purified IgG from Pfs25 spy-VLP 
vaccinated mice. This mixture was then fed to 4–6 day 
old starved female A. stephensi (SDA 500) mosquitoes via 
a parafilm® membrane. The mosquitoes were maintained 
at 26  °C and 80 % relative humidity. After 7 days mosqui-
toes (n = 20 per group) were dissected and the number 
of oocysts counted per mosquito midgut was recorded. 
Percent reduction in infection intensity was calculated 
relative to the respective control IgG (anti-ovalbumin 
mouse serum) tested in the same assay.
Inhibition of binding assays
Plasmodium falciparum (FCR3 genotype) parasites were 
maintained in culture as described [60]. Parasites were 
panned on BeWo cells to select for a chondroitin sulphate 
A (CSA)-binding phenotype, as described [61]. Parasite 
DNA was labeled with Tritium by overnight incorpora-
tion of titrated hypoxanthine. A 96-well plate (Falcon) 
 Page 14 of 16
Thrane et al. J Nanobiotechnol  (2016) 14:30 
was coated with 2 μg/ml of Decorin (Sigma-Aldrich) 
overnight and blocked with 2 % bovine serum albumin 
(Sigma) as described [60]. Tritium labeled late-stage 
infected erythrocytes (IEs) were MACS purified and 
added to the 96-well plate in a concentration of 200,000 
cells per well. Titrations of serum were added in a total 
volume of 100 μl in triplicate wells. After incubation for 
90 min at 37 °C, unbound IEs were washed away by a 
pipetting robot (Beckman-Coulter). The remaining IEs 
were harvested onto a filter plate (Perkin-Elmer). After 
addition of scintillation fluid (Perkin-Elmer) the counts 
per minute (CPM) recording the number of non-inhib-
ited IE was determined by liquid scintillation counting 
on a Topcount NXT (Perkin-Elmer). Data were adjusted 
to percentage of binding by dividing test result with the 
mean value of wells with IE incubated without serum.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analysis was done using non-parametric, 
two tailed, Mann–Whitney Rank Sum Test. Statistical 
significance was defined as P < 0.05.
Ethical statements
The animal studies were approved by the Danish Ani-
mal
