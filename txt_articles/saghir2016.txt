An important aspect of safety assessment of chemicals (industrial and agricultural chemicals and
pharmaceuticals) is determining their potential reproductive and developmental toxicity. A number of
guidelines have outlined a series of separate reproductive and developmental toxicity studies from
fertilization through adulthood and in some cases to second generation. The Extended One-Generation
Reproductive Toxicity Study (EOGRTS) is the most recent and comprehensive guideline in this series.
EOGRTS design makes toxicity testing progressive, comprehensive, and efficient by assessing key end-
points across multiple life-stages at relevant doses using a minimum number of animals, combining
studies/evaluations and proposing tiered-testing approaches based on outcomes. EOGRTS determines
toxicity during preconception, development of embryo/fetus and newborn, adolescence, and adults, with
specific emphasis on the nervous, immunological, and endocrine systems, EOGRTS also assesses
maternal and paternal toxicity. However, EOGRTS guideline is complex, criteria for selecting doses is
unclear, and monitoring systemic dose during the course of the study for better interpretation and
human relevance is not clear. This paper discusses potential simplification of EOGRTS, suggests pro-
cedures for relevant dose selection and monitors systemic dose at multiple life-stages for better inter-
pretation of data and human relevance.

1. Background
In order to provide a background for discussion of the EOGRTS
guidance, the readers should be aware of several other guideline
studies routinely conducted, primarily in rats, to determine im-
mediate and latent reproductive effects of chemical exposure.
Assessment of toxicity to reproduction includes possible effects of
chemicals on fertility, embryonic and fetal development, peri- and
postnatal
development,
and
maternal
function.
Traditionally,
separate reproductive/developmental toxicity studies are con-
ducted to evaluate these effects. Guidelines OECD 414 and OPPTS
870.3700 determine effects of chemicals on embryo-fetal devel-
opment/death, altered growth and structural changes (ICH, 2005;
OECD, 2001a; USEPA, 1998a). Effects of chemicals on maternal
behavior, length of gestation, dystocia, number and sex of pups, live
births, runts, presence of gross abnormalities, and abnormal
behavior in pups are determined in guidelines OECD 421 (screening
test) and OPPTS 870.3550 (ICH, 2005; OECD, 1995; USEPA, 2000a).
General and reproductive/developmental toxicity endpoints are
combined in OECD 422 (screening test) and OPPTS 870.3650
guidelines (OECD, 1996; USEPA, 2000b).
Guidelines OECD 415 and 416 determine effects of chemicals on
reproduction in one- and two-generation studies, respectively
(OECD, 1983, 2001b; USEPA, 1998b). The two-generation study
(OECD 416; OPPTS 870.3800) is considered the most comprehen-
sive design to assess reproductive toxicity (Carney and Sattivari,
2013) and the effects of chemicals on the reproductive perfor-
mance of the F1 parents. The two-generation study assesses effects
of chemicals on reproductive parameters listed for OECD 421 in P
and F1 generations as well as the presence of gross abnormalities
and abnormal behavior in F1 and F2 animals. The NTP's modified
one-generation study design determines effects of chemicals on
animals from gestation through weaning of F2 animals (Foster,
2014); however, no formal guideline document exists. The differ-
ence between the NTP design and other approved guidelines
include retention of multiple pups per litter rather than 1 pup/sex/
litter/dose group and premating treatment of males for a full 10

 weeks. However, both ICH and OECD guidelines indicate that a full
10-week premating period is often not needed, especially when
other general toxicity studies (e.g., existing subchronic studies)
indicate a lack of toxicity to the testes or uterus.
2. Current guidelines and modified approach
Most of the above described individual guidelines evaluate
toxicity of chemicals to only parts of the reproductive and develop-
mental stages with the exception the two-generation reproductive
toxicity study. These guideline studies have not been updated to
reflect advancements in the assessment of developmental and
reproductive toxicity. For example, researchers now like to combine
multiple reproductive and developmental toxicity studies into a
single study and determine systemic exposure during dose range-
finding or other general toxicity studies for the selection of appro-
priate doses (Chapman et al., 2013; Dorato et al., 2014; Marty et al.,
2013; Saghir et al., 2013). Although the two-generation toxicity
study is considered “the gold standard” for the assessment of
reproductive toxicity, it is complex in design, high in the utilization in
animals (~2600 animals for study in rats) and with debatable value of
the F2 generation (Janer et al., 2007a, 2007b; Moore et al., 2009;
Piersma et al., 2011; Rorije et al., 2011). The two-generation toxicity
study is also not designed to evaluate developmental neurotoxicity
(DNT) or developmental immunotoxicity (DIT) endpoints, which
require standalone studies using an additional 1280 animals.

 2.1. Extended one-generation reproductive toxicity study (EOGRTS)
To make the toxicity testing across life stages state-of-the-art,
the International Life Sciences Institute/Health and Environ-
mental Science Institute (ILSI/HESI) Agricultural Chemicals Safety
Assessment (ACSA) Technical Committee was charged with pro-
posing an improved testing paradigm to assess potential effects of
chemicals across life stages by incorporating the current under-
standing of developmental and reproductive toxicity (ILSI/HESI,
2001; Cooper et al., 2006). The committee identified key toxicity
profiles across life stages beyond developmental and reproductive
phases, combined studies/evaluations of endpoints across multiple
life stages, and proposed a tiered testing approach for flexibility
based on the needs and available data. The committee considered
approaches to assess the potential of chemicals to cause adverse
effects on reproduction, developmental life stages, and in the
elderly. The life stage toxicity was defined as the potential adverse
effects of chemicals on preconception, development (embryo/fetal
and newborn/pre-weaning life stages), adolescence, and adults of
all ages for reproductive and developmental toxicity, any special
sensitivity with respect to general toxicity and specific effects on
the nervous, immunological, and endocrine systems at critical life

 stages. Additionally, they emphasized using doses that are relevant
to realistic human exposures while maintaining adequate power to
detect toxicity utilizing a systemic dose in a minimum number of
animals (see Cooper et al., 2006; Marty et al., 2013; Saghir, 2015;
Saghir et al., 2012, 2013).
The ILSI/HESI-ACSA proposed study design (Cooper et al., 2006)
became the basis for the OECD 443 EOGRTS guideline (OECD, 2012).
The study starts with exposing a sufficient number of adult male
and female rats (to achieve 20 litters/dose) to the test chemical for
two weeks prior to mating through weaning. Both parents are then
sacrificed on study day (SD) 71 and evaluated while pups are
continuously dosed with the test chemical until their scheduled
sacrifice after evaluation for possible toxicological effects (Fig. 1).
Groups of pups are evaluated for developmental neurotoxicity and
at sexual maturity for reproductive, immuno, neuro, and general
toxicity, and bred, when triggered, to produce F2 litters. The trigger
to generate F2 animals in EOGRTS is based on developmental
landmarks (e.g., anogenital distance, nipple retention, puberty
onset) in F1 animals. In addition to the enhanced interpretative
value, the EOGRTS protocol also retains multiple pups per litter,
similar to the NTP study design and in contrast to retaining 1 pup/
sex/dose in conventional two-generation reproductive toxicity
study protocols (Marty et al., 2013). Therefore, it is not clear how
the NTP design offers additional advantage as mentioned by Foster
(2014). Feasibility/validation of EOGRTS was achieved in four
studies conducted for 2,4- dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)
methimazole, vinclozolin, and lead acetate (Fegert et al., 2012;
Marty et al., 2013; Milius et al., 2010; Schneider et al., 2011;
Wright et al., 2011).
Although,
the
EOGRTS
approach
provides
advantage
by
combining evaluations, adding DNT and DIT parameters and
decreasing animal use, it is not without criticism. Even though
Schiffelers et al. (2015) raised concern about the acceptance of the
current EOGRTS protocol in the Europe without amendments due
to criticism, the European Commission has recently adopted the
EOGRTS (EC, 2015). However, the Commission has left an option for
European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) to request performance of the
F2 generation when justified (EC, 2015). In addition to the debate
on the limited added value of the second generation (Janer et al.,
2007a, 2007b; Martin et al., 2009; Piersma et al., 2011; Rorije

 et al., 2011), the organization of the OECD 443 guideline is
perceived to be difficult to follow. The criteria for selecting the
highest dose is unclear (even though it recommends using tox-
icokinetic data generated in dose range-finding or other earlier
studies). In addition, procedures for monitoring the systemic dose,
for better interpretation and human relevance of the animal data,
are not included. Saghir et al. (2013), on the other hand, offered
criteria that can effectively guide dose selection and provide a
direct example of the strategy for practical implementation of
EOGRTS protocols. This paper examines ways to monitor systemic
dose during the course of EOGRTS using core study animals and to
select appropriate doses within dose-proportional range that are
relevant to actual human exposure (Saghir, 2015; Saghir et al., 2012,
2013).
3. Role of kinetics in dose selection and incorporation into
EOGRTS
Safety assessment of chemicals should focus on doses in animals
that are relevant to human exposure while adequate to detect
toxicity. One of the ways to determine the top dose for EOGRTS is to
determine systemic dose proportionality and select the top dose
based on the kinetically-derived maximum dose (KMD) at or
slightly above the point of departure (POD) from dose propor-
tionality (Marty et al., 2013; Saghir, 2015; Saghir et al., 2012, 2013).
The POD from dose proportionality can be determined in a dose
range-finding developmental study or in other repeat-dose toxicity
studies as described by Saghir et al. (2012) and Saghir (2015). An
effect observed in animals at the non-proportional systemic dose
may not be relevant to the assessment of actual human risk;
especially when the actual human exposure is many orders of
magnitude lower than those used in animal studies. Additionally, it
is recommended to have some kinetic information of chemicals in
the test animal species along with likely human exposure estimates
for appropriate margin of exposure before the initiation of repro-
ductive toxicity studies with collection of further kinetic informa-
tion in pregnant and lactating animals and in pups (ILSI/HESI, 2001;
Cooper et al., 2006; Saghir et al., 2013). An example is given in Fig. 2
where the top dose for 2,4-D EOGRTS was selected based on KMD at
slightly above the POD from proportionality of the systemic dose;
the dose selected was half of the maximum tolerated dose and still
several orders of magnitude higher than the expected human
exposure (see Marty et al., 2013; Saghir et al., 2013 for detail).
Determining systemic dose during the course of a reproductive/
developmental study is also helpful in understanding the exposure
at different life-stages (Fig. 3) for better interpretation of the hu-
man relevance of the results in test animals (Fegert et al., 2012;
Marty et al., 2013; Saghir et al., 2013). In dietary exposure studies,
the importance of adequately adjusting doses during different life-
stages is emphasized in Fig. 3. Failure to adjust dietary concentra-
tions can result in dramatically different systemic doses of test
chemicals reflective of differences in bodyweight to food intake
ratio, skewing the resulting risk assessment. In order to accomplish
the determination of systemic dose at various developmental life
stages, an approach for a single blood collection (�100 ml) at
reproductive/developmental landmarks during the course of the
study is proposed in Fig. 4 and Tables 1e4. Cord/pup along with
maternal blood may be collected from animals used in the dose-
range-finding (DRF) study or from dedicated groups in the main
study as outlined in Fig. 4, pooled for each litter/dose group to
achieve the minimum volume required for analysis. For the
collection of blood from PND 4 pups, use of culled and extra animals
in Cohort 3 of EOGRTS is recommended. Blood from each litter may
be pooled when needed. The DRF study for EOGRT, when needed,
can be designed to determine systemic dose in dams during
gestation and in dams and pups at birth or even in dams and fetuses
one day before parturition, if warranted, in a few designated ani-
mals in the DRF or main study. Similarly, milk can be obtained from

 dams during lactation from the DRF or designated main study an-
imals (see OECD, 2012; Marty et al., 2013; Saghir et al., 2013 for
detail). The collected blood (or processed plasma/serum) is
analyzed for the parent chemical and/or metabolite(s) of interest.
4. Detailed and easy to follow steps for EOGRTS
An easily followed general outline of the EOGRTS, beginning
before cohabitation through their final termination, is presented in
Table 1. The outline also includes blood sampling (a single sample of
�100 ml) at different life stages in order to determine changes in the
potentially fluctuating systemic dose (Figs. 2 and 3), and for better
understanding of the systemic exposure and associated human
relevance of the outcome. Collection of one blood sample during
designated life-stages is considered sufficient due to likely steady-
state systemic dose with diurnal fluctuations based on the mode of
dosing (e.g., dietary, through drinking water, daily oral gavage).
When a single sample-based approach fails to adequately establish
KMD of a chemical, collection of up to three blood samples at
specific times needs to be considered as described by Saghir et al.
(2006, 2013). Timing for the collection of blood sample(s) will
depend on the kinetics of the test chemical; see Saghir (2015) and
Saghir et al. (2006) for detail. The current EOGRTS design and
suggested modifications to assess the systemic dose at different life
stages are outlined in Figs. 1 and 4, respectively. Table 2 and Figs. 1
and 4 outline the EOGRTS processes for the F1 pups from their birth
through maturation including blood sampling for the assessment of
a systemic dose. Reproductive systems and general toxicity as-
sessments for the Cohort 1A and reproductive performance, when
triggered, of Cohort 1B pups along with the relationship with the
systemic dose of the test chemicals and/or metabolite(s) are out-
lined in Table 3. The triggers to mate Cohort 1B animals to generate
F2 animals is based on developmental landmarks (e.g., anogenital
distance, nipple retention, puberty onset) in F1 animals. Table 4
outlines procedures for the neurotoxicity evaluation of test chem-
icals in Cohorts 2A and 2B and immunotoxicity evaluation in Cohort
3. A list of neurobehavioral assessments are presented in Table 5.
5. Conclusion
The EOGRT studies are complex and require a close and
committed conversation among registrants, laboratories con-
ducting EOGRTS, and regulatory agencies. The inclusion of addi-
tional studies
for
immunotoxicity assessment must
also
be
carefully considered prior to finalization of the protocol; registrants
must have a clear idea of the data needed to address the critical
questions for each test chemical, and that the complex approach to
a large multipurpose study is warranted for both the critical

 question and the need for the data. Although EOGRTS is a complex
design needed significant resources, when conducted with the
proposed evaluations, especially systemic dose determination
across life-stage, has the potential to reduce the needs to conduct
several
additional
separate
developmental
and
reproductive
toxicity studies. EOGRTS, when designed properly, may reduce the
needs for studies such as OECD 414, 415, 416, 421, and 422 or those
listed in OPPTS and ICH guidelines, ideally to only one additional
study in a non-rodent (likely rabbit) species or to only those
needing to determine fetal abnormalities that cannot be assessed in
EOGRTS. The EOGRTS may also eliminate the need to separately
conduct DNT and/or DIT studies. Therefore, in our opinion, EOGRTS
with the proposed modifications, or a variant of it based on the
properties of the test chemicals and issues at hand, will accomplish
an overall reduction in the use of resources including the number of
animals used in a series of studies conducted to assess the devel-
opmental and reproductive toxicity (and possible mode-of-action
studies) of test chemicals by consolidating them into one large
multipurpose study. It is agreed that the benefits of consolidating
developmental and reproductive toxicity studies into one large
multipurpose study must be evaluated carefully in relation to the
questions needing answers.

Twenty-four hour or spot urine samples may be collected on days of blood collection to determine test chemical concentration.
Bold italic texts are proposed additions to improve the current EOGRTS design.
a Each session consists of 50 trials (5 blocks of 10 trials).
b In home cage and to a standard arena for observation (open field), see table for details.
c By using automated activity recording apparatus capable of detecting increase and decrease in activity.
d Multiple sections from olfactory bulbs, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, basal ganglia, thalamus, hypothalamus, mid-brain
(thecum, tegmentum, and cerebral peduncles), brain-stem and cerebellum. For Cohort 2A only, the eyes (retina and optic
nerve) and samples of peripheral nerve, muscle and spinal cord are examined.
e T-cell dependent antibody response assay, i.e. serum IgM antibody titres (sensitization to Sheep Red Blood Cells [SRBC] or
Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin [KLH]), or splenic IgM specific plaque-forming cells (PFC) units (sensitization to SRBC). Responses
typically peak four (PFC response) or five (ELISA) days after intravenous immunization. Additional pups may be required from
control to act as positive controls.
