Objective This review aims to analyse strength training-
based sports injury prevention randomised controlled 
trials (RCT) and present best evidence recommendations 
for athletes and future research. A priori PROSPERO 
registration; CRD42015006970. 
Design Systematic review, qualitative analysis and 
meta-analysis. Sorting of studies and quality assessments 
were performed by two independent authors. Qualitative 
analyses, relative risk (RR) estimate with robustness and 
strength of evidence tests, formal tests of publication 
bias and post-hoc meta-regression were performed.
Data sources PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and 
SPORTDiscus were searched to July 2017.
Eligibility criteria for selecting studies RCTs on 
strength training exercises as primary prevention of 
sports injuries.
Results Six studies analysed five different interventions 
with four distinct outcomes. 7738 participants aged 
12–40 years were included and sustained 177 acute or 
overuse injuries. Studies were published in 2003–2016, 
five from Europe and one from Africa. Cluster-adjusted 
intention-to-treat analysis established RR 0.338 (0.238–
0.480). The result was consistent across robustness tests 
and strength of evidence was high. A 10% increase in 
strength training volume reduced the risk of injury by 
more than four percentage points. Formal tests found no 
publication bias.
Conclusion The included studies were generally well 
designed and executed, had high compliance rates, 
were safe, and attained consistently favourable results 
across four different acute and overuse injury outcomes 
despite considerable differences in populations and 
interventions. Increasing strength training volume 
and intensity were associated with sports injury risk 
reduction. Three characteristically different approaches to 
prevention mechanisms were identified and incorporated 
into contemporary strength training recommendations. 
InTRODuCTIOn
Exercise constitutes a cornerstone in the quality of 
life of recreational athletes, prevention of meta-
bolic and frailty syndromes and in the worldwide 
elite sports entertainment business.1 2 Effective 
prevention of sports injuries, as the sole prevalent 
adverse effect of physical activity, could potentially 
benefit a wide spectrum of individuals involved in 
any form of exercise.3–6 While the management of 
sports injuries can be troublesome, time-consuming 
and expensive, prevention in the form of strength 
training has proved to be accessible, effective 
and cost-effective for populations.7–11 However, 
research has yet to establish fundamental strength 
training prevention mechanisms and parameters for 
optimization.
In 2013, Lauersen et al7 quantitatively compared 
the preventive effects of different types of exercise 
programmes: strength training, proprioception, 
stretching and multicomponent interventions. The 
obvious next step would be a further description and 
qualitative analysis of these four intervention types. 
However, several reviews have satisfactorily anal-
ysed both proprioception and stretching studies,12–15 
while multicomponent programmes have proved 
problematic to analyse qualitatively due to their 
complex nature.16 17 Therefore strength training, 
which proved the most effective, represented the 
logical progression and, to our knowledge, existing 
strength training research has primarily focused on 
biomolecular aspects, fall prevention in the elderly, 
general health gains or specific musculoskeletal 
injuries. Analysis of study design and execution, 
content of strength training interventions, injury 
outcomes, intervention safety and extraction of 
potential general prevention principles should 
enable the formulation of clinically relevant conclu-
sions and best evidence recommendations for both 
contemporary prevention programmes and future 
research. As the current literature and guidelines are 
not fully developed, the aims of this review were to 
systematically identify and analyse qualitatively and 
quantitatively randomised controlled trials (RCTs) 
of strength training-based sports injury prevention 
programmes.

search strategy, study selection and qualitative 
analyses
A review protocol was registered in PROSPERO 
(CRD42015006970) in September 2015 (see online 
supplement section §1), comprising a priori specifi-
cation of analyses, study inclusion/exclusion criteria 
(table 1), injury definitions for study selection (see 
online supplement section §2)18 19 and complete 
search strategy (see online supplement section §3). 
The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and SPORT-
Discus electronic databases were updated from 
October 2012 to 19 July 2017 and added to an 
existing search result,7 as shown in the study selec-
tion flowchart (figure 1). The search contained four 
blocks of keywords related to exercise programmes,

assistance of a librarian.
T
wo reviewers (JBL and LBA) independently screened all 
titles, abstracts and full-text articles and assessed risks of bias 
in the included studies using the domain-based evaluation tool 
recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration.20 Sorting and 
assessment discrepancies were resolved through discussion. 
Qualitative data were extracted from study reports and the 
corresponding authors were contacted by email in cases where 
additional information (both quantitative and qualitative) was 
required.
Quantitative analyses
Meta-analysis relative risk (RR) estimates, including all injury 
types, were calculated in Stata 12. Studies with incorrect anal-
ysis of cluster randomisation were adjusted and the strength of 
evidence was evaluated using GRADEpro.21 22 To achieve cluster 
adjustment, an intracluster correlation coefficient (ρ), based on a 
ρ value averaged from sports injury prevention studies appropri-
ately adjusting for clustering effects, was computed as described 
in Lauersen et al.7 We assessed heterogeneity using I2, calcu-
lated from the Stata Q-value, and number of studies (n) by I2 
= (Q−(n−1))/Q. A rough interpretation guide of I2 has been 
proposed by Higgins et al.23 Publication bias was formally tested

plot and a funnel plot. To assess the robustness of the results we 
performed subgroup analyses on age groups, blinding, interven-
tion type and outcomes together with a meta-regression on the 
total assessed study quality.
A post hoc meta-regression of strength training volume (repe-
titions/week), intensity (xRM) and intervention duration (weeks) 
was performed to test for a dose–response relationship between 
strength training parameters and injury prevention effect. The 
model included all three variables with mutual adjustment. 
Logarithmic transformation of volume data eliminated skew-
ness, enabling a correct meta-regression. Volumes and intensities 
were computed as averages and eccentric-only exercises as half 
of repetitions, but at 115% intensity, compared with exercises 
including both concentric and eccentric load phases (see full 
specification of assumptions, calculations and quantification in 
online supplement sections §9.1 and §9.2).24 25
REsulTs
A systematic search yielded 1559 records, of which 190 were 
duplicates. We excluded 1350 records by title, 11 references 
were excluded by abstract and six were eliminated by full-text 
screening (figure 1). Hand searching of reference lists and a 
grey literature search found no further studies (full study selec-
tion specification in online supplement sections §4.1 and §4.2). 
T
wo articles were added to the four strength training studies 
from Lauersen et al,7 so six studies were finally included in our 
systematic review.
The six studies included 7738 participants aged 12–40 
years with 177 observed injuries. Four studies analysed acute 
outcomes,26–29 one an overuse outcome30 and one study analysed 
all injuries31 (see online supplement section §5 for a detailed 
description of study characteristics). On the basis of a lack of 
cluster adjustment, the power of the study by van der Horst 
 
et al27 was reduced by an inflation factor of 1.59. The cluster-ad-
justed and intention-to-treat analysed relative risk (RR) estimate 
of the six included studies was 0.338 (95% CI 0.238 to 0.480, 
P<0.0001, I2=0%, P=0.910)(figure 2).
GRADEpro analysis found a ‘high certainty’ of evidence (see 
online supplement section §7). Neither subgroup analyses of 
age (adults vs adolescents), blinding (participant and/or assessor 
blinded vs non-blinded), intervention type (hamstring training 
vs ‘other’) and outcomes (acute vs overuse injuries) nor meta-re-
gression of total assessed study quality showed significant 
differences.
Harbord’s small-study effect test (P=0.425), the modified 
Galbraith plot (online supplement section §8.1) and symmetric 
funnel plot (online supplement section §8.2) found no indica-
tions of publication bias.
Design of included studies
The study populations, power and follow-up periods showed 
considerable differences between the six strength training studies. 
The study by Coppack et al30 analysed 1502 military conscripts 
while the remaining five studies included soccer players of various 
ages and levels. Askling et al26 and Zouita et al,31 respectively, 
included 30 adult elite players and 54 youth elite players in indi-
vidual randomised studies while the remaining studies performed 
team cluster-randomised designs. Van der Horst et al27 included 
648 amateur male soccer players, Petersen et al28 942 mixed 
amateur and elite players and Waldén et al29 included 4564 female 
adolescent players. In the study by Coppack et al30 the follow-up 
period was restricted to 14 weeks due to military commitments 
while, in the other five studies, participants were followed up for 
one season, ranging from 7 to 12 months.
Risk of bias assessment
Apart from the difficulties in achieving participant and/or 
outcome assessor blinding, no compromising risks of bias were 
identified. Several studies made efforts to achieve blinding. 
We considered the studies by Askling et al,26 Coppack et al30 
and Waldén et al29 to have a low risk of detection bias, and the 
study by Coppack et al30 to have a low risk of performance bias 
(for risk of bias specification see figure 3 and online supple-
ment section §6). The studies by Coppack et al,30 Petersen 
 
et al28 and Waldén et al29 made appropriate statistical adjust-
ments for their cluster-randomised designs (low risk of 'other 
bias’), but the study by van der Horst et al27 did not (high risk 
of ‘other bias’). The six studies either conducted intention-to-
treat analyses or had no missing data, thus having a low risk of 
attrition bias.
Compliance
Compliance was most frequently achieved through education 
of coaches, written material or supervision of training sessions 
(table 2). The qualifications of the supervisors ranged from 
one-day familiarisation of army instructors to experienced 
medical professionals. Askling et al26 reported full compliance 
with the intervention training programme (ie, all players attended 
all training sessions). Coppack et al30 (participation in sessions), 
van der Horst et al27 (registration of performed exercises) and 
Petersen et al28 (registration of performed exercises) all reported 
compliance of 91%. The studies by Waldén et al29 and Zouita 
et al,31 respectively, had coaches and players document strength 
training participation to improve compliance and adherence but 
did not report these or any other compliance measures.
Notable factors to facilitate compliance and technique were 
used by Waldén et al29 who performed regular spot tests, van 
der Horst et al27 who held evaluation meetings and designed 
a website and Zouita et al31 who included variation elements 
to a tightly scheduled programme for young elite soccer players 
living at a Tunisian soccer centre.
Interventions and outcomes
Although all six studies designed interventions based on existing 
methodology and principles, the strength training programmes 
differed considerably between studies. The average volume 
(amount of exercise), average intensity (measured by number of

possible repetitions/sets in the form of x repetition maximum 
(xRM)) and mean (range) programme duration were 80.33 
(11.7–253) repetitions/week, 8.39 (7.14–9.27) RM and 21.39 
(10–39.93) weeks, respectively. RR estimates of included studies 
varied from 0.25 (0.13–0.48) to 0.43 (0.21–0.90).
Askling et al,26 van der Horst et al27 and Petersen et al28 
performed 
directly 
comparable 
pre-season 
hamstring 
programmes with the aim of preventing acute hamstring inju-
ries in soccer players. Programme intensities and durations were 
similar, but the volumes (repetitions/week) differed. van der 
Horst et al27 (11.7 repetitions/week), Petersen et al28 (18.9 repe-
titions/week) and Askling et al26 (64 repetitions/week) included 
increasing average volumes/week and correspondingly achieved 
decreasing RRs of 0.43 (0.21–0.90), 0.41 (0.18–0.93) and 0.30 
(0.07–1.31), respectively. Petersen et al28 further implemented 
maintenance sessions once a week after the end of the pre-season 
programme. Askling et al26 differed from the two Nordic 
hamstring programmes by training-to-failure (not a fixed number 
but repetitions to exhaustion) and including both concentric and 
eccentric loads in flywheel exercises. van der Horst et al27 and 
Petersen et al28 reported that no injuries occurred among their 
total of 753 participants during the Nordic hamstring exercises.
The remaining three studies performed appreciably different 
interventions and investigated different outcomes.
Coppack et al30 introduced a 14-week programme with 
four daily strength training exercises (plus minor elements 
of stretching) designed to invoke functional concentric and 
eccentric contractions of the hip and knee extensors to prevent 
overuse anterior knee pain in military recruits. Volumes and 
intensities were reported to increase through the intervention 
phases, but full specification was not given. The military recruits 
performed the largest volume of strength training among the 
included studies. A RR of 0.25 (0.13–0.48) was achieved in rela-
tion to overuse anterior knee pain. There were no adverse events 
resulting from strength training among the 759 male and female 
recruits.
Waldén et al29 applied a 20-min, whole-season, two sessions/
week balance, core stability and knee alignment programme to 
prevent acute anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) knee injuries 
(primary outcome). Both strength training in the classical sense 
(slow single-leg squat, slow bilateral squats and bench press) and 
coordination/joint proprioception-demanding dynamic exercises 
(pelvic lifts, lunges and jump/landing technique) were included 
and progressed in loads and coordination difficulty. No injuries 
among the 2479 12–17-year-old participants in the intervention 
group were attributed to strength training. The programme was 
performed twice/week for a full season and the RR estimate 
was 0.36 (0.15–0.85). There were no statistical differences 
concerning severe knee injuries or other knee injuries (secondary 
outcomes).
Zouita et al31 studied a 13–14-year-old population of elite 
soccer players with sports injury as a secondary outcome. 
The intervention distinctively incorporated technique famil-
iarisation, individualised load and progression calculations, 
goal-specific phases and periodisation, inter-phase recovery 
weeks and programme variation (to avoid monotony and 
performance plateaus), together with forced repetitions 
(completion of all sets even if assistance was required). Thir-
ty-six sessions of 10 exercises (including squats, bench press, 
push-ups and sit-ups) were performed for 90 min with loads 
ranging from initial 30% 1RM to 80% 1RM in the concluding 
high-intensity phase. The full programme specification was 
unspecified. Exercise velocity, intensity, technique, safety and 
rest periods were supervised by a physical coach. They defined 
injury as time loss exceeding 3 days but reported no statistical 
analyses.31 Based on reported participant and injury data, RR 
0.31 (0.09–1.07, P=0.06) was calculated. Registered injuries 
were predominantly in the lower limbs, accounting for time 
losses from training/match of 18 and 147 hours for the inter-
vention and control groups, respectively.
Dose–response meta-regression
The study by Zouita et al was excluded from calculations on the 
basis of insufficient data and author correspondence.
In co-analysis meta-regression, intervention duration was not 
significant (β=−0.079, P=0.065) while increasing ln(volume/
week) (β=−1.365, P<0.005) and intensity (β=1.971, P<0.005) 
correlated significantly with sports injury prevention. A 10% 
increase in the number of strength training repetitions was asso-
ciated with a 4.3 percentage point (and 13% relative) risk reduc-
tion, from RR 0.338 (0.238–0.480) to RR 0.295 (0.208–0.419), 
assuming programme intensity and duration were constant.

Review
Mechanisms for prevention of acute and overuse injuries
Acute/overuse definitions are shown in online supplement 
section §2.32 Only Coppack et al30 supplied full and separate 
information on overuse and acute injuries in the knee and ankle 
joints. Zouita et al31 included a table of mixed acute and overuse 
injuries; however, the specification of four ‘recurrent’ injuries 
(equally distributed between study groups) was not available.
Four studies analysed acute injuries. The rationale of the three 
hamstring studies26–28 was a simple and direct strengthening of 
the frequently injured muscle, while the ACL injury prevention 
study29 primarily aimed at improving strength and coordina-
tion of the knee, pelvis and core. In all four studies a significant 
reduction in the acute sports injuries in question was achieved.
Coppack et al30 analysed overuse anterior knee pain, defined 
as aggravation of localised pain by repetitive and compressive 
forces. Strength training was performed in addition to initia-
tion of a basic military programme for first-phase recruits and 
aimed at restoring patellar alignment in the femoral groove 
to avoid localised excessive joint loads and optimising quadri-
ceps function. Besides reducing anterior knee pain by 75% in 
the intervention group, other injuries of the knee and ankle 
showed a generally mixed picture. Zouita et al31 addressed the 
risk of overuse injuries by implementing a familiarisation phase, 
individualised programmes, recovery weeks and variation, but 
reported no distinct data on overuse injuries.
DIsCussIOn
Six original RCTs reported five different strength training inter-
ventions and four distinct outcomes. The studies were published 
in 2003–2016, five studies from Europe and one from Africa. 
Four of the studies presented correctly analysed effect estimates. 
Implementation of the strength training interventions varied 
across the studies, but consistently showed a unique potential to 
prevent acute and overuse sports injuries.
An I2 score of 0% indicates low statistical heterogeneity in 
study outcomes. Neither Harbord’s small-study effects test 
(P=0.425), the modified Galbraith’s plot nor funnel plots indi-
cated publication bias across the field of strength training inter-
ventions to prevent sports injuries.
Design, risk of bias and compliance
Substantial power differences between the studies were found. 
As statistical power relies on the number of injuries, injury 
prevention studies require a large number of participants as the 
injuries are often relatively infrequent and team-based cluster 
designs deflate power further.33
All six RCTs had strengths and limitations. The gold standard 
study would comprise Waldén et al’s29 population size, van der 
Horst et al’s27 compliance-enhancing measures, Zouita et al’s31 
intervention thoroughness, Askling et al’s26 intervention descrip-
tion, Petersen et al’s28 intervention duration and Coppack 
 
et al’s30 injury specification.
Quality, design and compliance rates of the included studies 
were generally convincing.7 Considering demanding blinding 
conditions due to the nature of the interventions, successful 
participant blinding in one study and outcome blinding in three 
studies is respectable.34 All injuries were assessed by medical 
professionals.
In view of the time consumption and effort needed for a 
strength training intervention, the four reported compliance rates 
were high.35 36 Zouita et al,31 in our view, implemented a theoret-
ically optimal design for compliance optimisation although not 
reporting a compliance measure. While compliance in research 
settings was satisfactory, a challenge still persists in club adher-
ence.37 38 One suggestion to improve compliance and adherence 
could be to emphasise the fact that strength training prevention 
programmes may also improve sport-specific performance.39
Interventions and outcomes
Strength training programmes reduced sports injuries by an 
average of 66% and were, with 95% certainty, able to more than 
halve the risk of sports injury (95% 
CI 52% to 76%). Coppack 
et al,30 Horst et al,27 Petersen et al28 and Waldén et al29 reported 
no adverse events among their total of 3991 individuals during 
or due to the strength training interventions. With an average 
of more than 8 months of programme intervention in these 
four studies, we perceive this as a noteworthy accomplishment. 
Both our qualitative and quantitative analyses are in agreement 
with the literature that strength training is safe for children and 
adolescents and adds to the existing evidence by establishing that 
preparatory strength training also prevents acute and overuse 
injuries in adolescents.8 40 41
Petersen et al28 and Waldén et al29 intervened throughout a 
whole season while Askling et al,26 Coppack et al,30 van der Horst 
et al27 and Zouita et al31 all intervened for 10–14 weeks with 
a typically greater volume of strength training. Van der Horst 
et al27 neither implemented a prolonged intervention period 
nor an intensive strength training programme and achieved the 
least favourable result, although a 43% reduction in injury is in 
no way negligible. From the three directly comparable studies, 
Askling et al26 reported slightly better compliance, included 
concentric contractions and greater volume and intensity of 
strength training than the Nordic hamstring programmes studies 
by van der Horst et al27 and Petersen et al,28 which instead inter-
vened over longer periods of time. The study by Askling et al 
achieved the most favourable RR estimate.
Dose–response meta-regression
Co-analysis meta-regression of all studies other than that of 
Zouita et al reached significance for volume/week and intensity, 
but not intervention duration. This strongly indicates that future 
studies and prevention programmes should comprise signifi-
cant volumes and intensities of strength training to increase the 
prevention effect (while not neglecting to consider too abrupt 
increases and consequent risks of overuse injuries). Regarding 
programme duration, it remains unknown whether the weaker 
correlation is due to lower compliance, physiological reasons 
or other factors. The dose-dependent prevention effect was 
quantitatively expressed for clarity and layman communication 
purposes (see later section on Strength training recommenda-
tions for further clinical considerations).
Other parameters or conditions hypothesised to influence 
strength training results are rest times between sets, rest times 
between sessions, periodisation, exercise range of motion and 
execution speed.42 Further research, including full and consistent 
reporting of intervention characteristics, is needed to address 
these additional factors.
Mechanisms for prevention of acute and overuse injuries
As with the sports injury prevention field in general, most 
strength training studies have shortcomings regarding full injury 
specification and distinction between acute and overuse injuries.
Acute sports injuries were successfully reduced by two 
contrasting mechanisms. Three hamstring studies showed a direct 
effect of strength training in preventing acute hamstring muscle 
injuries. Waldén et al29 achieved a 64% ACL injury reduction

Review
by a seemingly indirect mechanism, focusing on improved 
core stability, pelvis control and extremity coordination.43–45 
We hypothesise that the indirect acute injury prevention effect 
works through mechanisms of strength training-related carry-
over effect with improved coordination, enhanced technique 
in training/match situations, strengthening of adjacent tissues 
reducing critical joint loads and better psychological perception 
of high-risk situations.3 46
Regarding overuse injuries, Coppack et al,30 apart from the 
primary overuse anterior knee pain reduction of 75%, showed 
generally mixed and not statistically analysed results. It is worth 
noting the volume of seven sessions/week and programme intro-
duction concurrent with military training, considering that 
gradual increases in loads, remodelling capacity and vasculari-
sation are thought to be important factors in tissue anabolism/
catabolism balances and therefore overuse injuries.47–55 These 
results point towards the patellar alignment theory,56 which is 
hypothesised to alleviate localised overuse stresses at the joint 
cartilage, being effective, while the design may be suboptimal 
for overuse injury prevention in general. Zouita et al31 designed 
thoughtful gradual load progressions but unfortunately did not 
provide specific overuse injury data for evaluation. Although 
fully individualised programmes and physical coach-super-
vised forced repetitions may be unattainable in most large-scale 
studies, parameters such as familiarisation, athlete/coach indi-
vidualised workload education, goal-specific progressive phases, 
appropriate variation and recovery measures should be realistic 
considerations.
These studies support the notion that overuse injuries occur 
when tissues are chronically overloaded, and we suggest that 
preventive mechanisms, besides simply evading pain triggers 
or reducing the amount of training/competition in burdened 
periods, could include preconditioning, tissue-relieving variation 
in exercises and loads, and carry-over of improved coordina-
tion/technique from a strength training prevention programme, 
potentially beneficially altering load distributions in the tissues 
and joints.30 46 55
strength training recommendations
Although strength training evidence and programmes are contin-
uously developing, contemporary principles and recommenda-
tions remain important for current athletes and in directing 
future research.
Based on the included studies, we recommend a familiar-
isation/technique phase prior to gradual volume and intensity 
progressing phases. This approach will address key param-
eters and mechanisms for acute and overuse injuries for both 
the strength training intervention and the often concurrent 
participation in sport or other physical activities. The evidence 
clearly points towards strengthening failure thresholds of rele-
vant tissues, sufficient technique and psychological preparedness 
to prevent acute injuries3 46 and gradual tissue conditioning, 
sufficient technique and training variation to prevent overuse 
injuries.30 46 55 Preliminary phases may seem irrelevant to eager 
athletes/clubs, however we consider the initial phases of injury 
prevention to be a critical investment, especially as injuries 
inevitably constitute delays and setbacks in relation to the very 
same goals as the original sport participation.55 57 58 Initiation in 
off-season or less demanding periods would be advantageous, 
especially in relation to overuse injuries. Additionally, interven-
tions have been shown to prevent injuries and also to improve 
sport performance, which is an important aspect for coaches and 
athletes.6 39
Thorough consideration should be given to sufficient 
programme volumes and intensities. The dose–response relation-
ship found in our analyses supports the hypothesis that strength 
improvement and injury prevention are closely related.59 60 
Neither qualitative nor quantitative analyses showed that chil-
dren and adolescents warrant significantly different approaches; 
however, we recommend avoidance of explosive loads together 
with at least equal emphasis on qualified instruction, compe-
tent supervision, appropriate volume and intensity progression 
as in adults.8 40 41 Supervision, short-term periodisation, long-
term variation, %RM-individualised loads and appropriate rest 
periods can profitably be incorporated.42 61 62 Heavy weight 
training as a warm-up before other athletic activities cannot be 
recommended as the resulting fatigue may both be detrimental 
to performance and increase the risk of injuries.42 55 The recom-
mended rest period between maximal efforts is approximately 
72 
hours for beginners, with experienced and physiologically 
adapted athletes likely needing shorter recovery times.42 55 63 We 
hypothesise that completion of this approach over successive 
seasons will afford incremental carry-over gains in prevention 
effectiveness as reductions of modifiable risk factors accumulate.
Perspectives
Aetiological factors of sports injuries suggested in the literature 
to be susceptible to injury prevention measures are muscular 
imbalance (eg, low hamstring:quadriceps strength ratio), muscle 
fatigue, muscle tightness, insufficient warm-up and previous 
injuries.64–69 These risk factors have further been presumed to 
be additive, and exceeding a threshold of cumulating risk factors 
has been hypothesised to result in an injury.59 70 Similar aetiolog-
ical factors have been proposed for ankle injuries and may even 
be applicable to multiple/all sports injuries.71
Insufficient strength of the vaguely defined ‘core muscles’ 
has been proposed as an important risk factor of groin strains 
and possibly other injuries on the basis of poor biomechanical 
translation of loads, illustrating the complexity of sports inju-
ries.72 Future sports injury prevention studies should keep the 
factor of core strength in mind when including individuals and 
designing interventions if we are to incorporate it relevantly into 
our understanding of sports injuries. Adding to the intricacy of 
acute sports injuries is the question of individual cognitive and 
spatial capabilities, postural balance and coordination skills, and 
new research areas such as functioning muscle chains and the 
role of coherent muscle fasciae throughout the whole body.73 74
strength and limitations
This review registered a priori specification of aims and methods 
in PROSPERO (CRD42015006970). We adhered to AMSTAR, 
MOOSE and PRISMA guidelines, determined meta-analysis 
strength of evidence using GRADEpro and tested for publication 
bias.75 Certainty of Harbord’s small-study effects test requires 10 
included studies, and a funnel plot was produced for additional 
visual assessment of publication bias. Study selection and the 
Cochrane domain-based risk of bias assessment were conducted 
by two independent researchers. Only English manuscripts were 
included, which increases the risk of language bias.
Incorrect cluster-randomisation analysis of original studies 
was adjusted in accordance with the mathematics of Emery 
 
et al21 and an assumption of team size in team sports to be rela-
tively similar.22 Although potentially rendering the estimate by 
van der Horst et al27 to be slightly imprecise, this is preferable to 
the alternative vast overestimation of study power, frequently in 
the range of a factor 2–3. We consider this correction of included

Review
What is already known?
 
► Strength training programmes to prevent acute and overuse 
sports injury are effective. 
 
► Neuromuscular training and multicomponent programme 
studies are effective, but to a lesser degree than strength 
training programmes. 
 
► The number of studies exclusively analysing strength training 
interventions is increasing. 
What are the new findings?
 
► Strength training injury prevention studies are of generally 
convincing quality. 
 
► Despite noticeable differences in populations and 
interventions, strength training attained consistently 
favorable results across four different acute and overuse 
injury outcomes. 
 
► Nearly 4000 individuals performed interventions for several 
months without a single adverse event being accredited to 
strength training interventions. 
 
► Three characteristically different approaches to prevention 
mechanisms were identified.
 
► A dose–response between strength training and the 
preventive effect on sports injuries. 
data to be a notable strength of our meta-analysis. Our subgroup 
analyses of RR estimates to assess consistency of results should be 
carefully interpreted due to limited statistical power. However, 
neither significant differences nor tendencies were found and we 
consider our results to be robust to age, study blinding, study 
quality, intervention and injury type.
We consider the explicit quantification of the dose–response 
relationship to be a strength in relation to scientific evalua-
tion of interventions, communication with lay people and, in 
turn, potentially their motivation to adhere to the intervention. 
However, such calculations can only be considered valid within 
the range of the included data. We did not quantify strength 
training intensity as a narrow range of 6.9–9.3RM was likely to 
result in an imprecise estimate.
Although five of the six included studies enrolled populations 
of football players, both the included evidence and the litera-
ture point towards plausible and general mechanisms that make 
these findings externally valid.76 While exercises can be claimed 
to be site-specific and injuries of interest to be sport-specific, the 
mechanisms and cause of effect most likely cannot. Although the 
evidence for strength training would still benefit from further 
and broader research, we consider the included studies to be 
similar enough to compare, and different enough to elicit gener-
ally applicable conclusions. Put into perspective, we believe 
the evidence provided in this article is sufficient to warrant a 
paradigm shift from the current dominance of multicomponent 
prevention programmes towards strength training programmes 
as the primary intervention to prevent sports injuries.
COnClusIOn
Despite differing with regard to populations, interventions 
and analyses, all six included studies were of high quality and 
demonstrated a dose–response relationship between strength 
training and sports injury prevention. In addition to being 
very safe, these interventions have—through more than one 
mechanism—proven prevention results seldom achieved by 
other exercise interventions or fields of medicine.
