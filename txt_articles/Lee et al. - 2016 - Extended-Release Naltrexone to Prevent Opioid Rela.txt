_______________ WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS _______________ 
63 • 
Vulnerability to Opioid Overdose: Following VIVITROL treatment 
64 
opioid tolerance is reduced from pretreatment baseline, and patients are 
65 
vulnerable to potentially fatal overdose at the end of a dosing interval, 
66 
after missing a dose, or after discontinuing VIVITROL treatment. 
67 
Attempts to overcome blockade may also lead to fatal overdose (5.1). 
68 • 
Injection Site Reactions: In some cases, injection site reactions may be 
69 
very severe.  Some cases of injection site reactions required surgical 
70 
intervention (5.2). 
71 • 
Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal: Opioid-dependent and opioid­
72 
using patients, including those being treated for alcohol dependence, 
73 
should be opioid-free before starting VIVITROL treatment, and should 
74 
notify healthcare providers of any recent opioid use.  An opioid-free 
75 
duration of a minimum of 7-10 days is recommended for patients to 
76 
avoid precipitation of opioid withdrawal that may be severe enough to 
77 
require hospitalization. (5.3). 
78 • 
Hepatotoxicity: Cases of hepatitis and clinically significant liver 
79 
dysfunction were observed in association with VIVITROL treatment 
80 
during the clinical development program and in the postmarketing 
81

FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION 
1 
INDICATIONS AND USAGE 
Treatment with VIVITROL should be part of a comprehensive management program that 
includes psychosocial support. 
1.1 
Alcohol Dependence 
VIVITROL is indicated for the treatment of alcohol dependence in patients who are able to 
abstain from alcohol in an outpatient setting prior to initiation of treatment with VIVITROL.  
Patients should not be actively drinking at the time of initial VIVITROL administration. 
1.2 
Opioid Dependence 
VIVITROL is indicated for the prevention of relapse to opioid dependence, following opioid 
detoxification. 
2 
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 
VIVITROL must be prepared and administered by a healthcare provider. 
Prior to initiating VIVITROL, an opioid-free duration of a minimum of 7–10 days is 
recommended for patients, to avoid precipitation of opioid withdrawal that may be severe 
enough to require hospitalization [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 
The recommended dose of VIVITROL is 380 mg delivered intramuscularly every 4 weeks or 
once a month.  The injection should be administered by a healthcare provider as an intramuscular 
(IM) gluteal injection, alternating buttocks for each subsequent injection, using the carton 
components provided [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)]. The needles provided in 
the carton are customized needles.  VIVITROL must not be injected using any other needle.  The 
needle lengths (either 1.5 or 2 inches) may not be adequate in every patient because of body 
habitus. Body habitus should be assessed prior to each injection for each patient to assure that 
needle length is adequate for intramuscular administration.  For patients with a larger amount of 
subcutaneous tissue overlying the gluteal muscle, the administering healthcare provider may 
utilize the supplied 2-inch needle with needle protection device to help ensure that the injectate 
reaches the intramuscular mass.  For very lean patients, the 1.5-inch needle may be appropriate 
to prevent the needle contacting the periosteum.  Either needle may be used for patients with 
average body habitus. Healthcare providers should ensure that the VIVITROL injection is given 
correctly, and should consider alternate treatment for those patients whose body habitus 
precludes an intramuscular gluteal injection with one of the provided needles. 
VIVITROL must not be administered intravenously or subcutaneously. 
If a patient misses a dose, he/she should be instructed to receive the next dose as soon as 
possible.

Reference ID: 3348450 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Pretreatment with oral naltrexone is not required before using VIVITROL. 
2.1  
Reinitiation of Treatment in Patients Previously Discontinued 
There are no data to specifically address reinitiation of treatment.  Patients reinitiating treatment 
with VIVITROL should be opioid-free at the time of dose administration [see Indications and 
Usage (1), Contraindications (4), and Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 
2.2  
Switching From Oral Naltrexone 
There are no systematically collected data that specifically address the switch from oral 
naltrexone to VIVITROL. 
2.3 
 
Switching from Buprenorphine, Buprenorphine/Naloxone, or 
Methadone 
There are no systematically collected data that specifically address the switch from 
buprenorphine or methadone to VIVITROL; however, review of postmarketing case reports have 
indicated that some patients may experience severe manifestations of precipitated withdrawal 
when being switched from opioid agonist therapy to opioid antagonist therapy [see Warnings 
and Precautions (5.3)]. Patients transitioning from buprenorphine or methadone may be 
vulnerable to precipitation of withdrawal symptoms for as long as 2 weeks. Healthcare providers 
should be prepared to manage withdrawal symptomatically with non-opioid medications. 
2.4  
Directions for Use 
To ensure proper dosing, it is important that you follow the preparation and administration 
instructions outlined in this document. 
VIVITROL must be suspended only in the diluent supplied in the carton and must be 
administered only with one of the administration needles supplied in the carton. The 
microspheres, diluent, preparation needle, and an administration needle with needle protection 
device are required for preparation and administration.  Two thin-walled 1.5-inch needles with 
needle protection device and two 2-inch thin-walled needles with needle protection device have 
been provided to accommodate varying patient body habitus.  For patients with a larger amount 
of subcutaneous tissue overlying the gluteal muscle, the administering healthcare provider may 
utilize the supplied 2-inch needle with needle protection device to help ensure that the injectate 
reaches the intramuscular mass.  For very lean patients, the 1.5-inch needle may be appropriate 
to prevent the needle contacting the periosteum.  Either needle may be used for patients with 
average body habitus.  A spare administration needle of each size is provided in case of clogging 
[see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16)]. Do not substitute any other components for the 
components of the carton. 
Prior to preparation, allow drug to reach room temperature (approximately 45 minutes). 
Parenteral products should be visually inspected for particulate matter and discoloration prior to 
administration whenever solution and container permit.  A properly mixed suspension will be 
milky white, will not contain clumps, and will move freely down the wall of the vial [see 
Directions for Use, illustration below].

DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS 
VIVITROL is an injectable suspension for single use.  VIVITROL contains 380 mg of 
naltrexone in a microsphere formulation per vial (337 mg of naltrexone per gram of 
microspheres) and 4 mL diluent.  
4. 
CONTRAINDICATIONS 
VIVITROL is contraindicated in: 
•  Patients receiving opioid analgesics [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 
•  Patients with current physiologic opioid dependence [see Warnings and Precautions 
(5.3)]. 
•  Patients in acute opioid withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 
•  Any individual who has failed the naloxone challenge test or has a positive urine 
screen for opioids [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 
•  Patients who have previously exhibited hypersensitivity to naltrexone, PLG, 
carboxymethylcellulose, or any other components of the diluent [see Warnings and 
Precautions (5.8)]. 
5 
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 
5.1 
Vulnerability to Opioid Overdose 
After opioid detoxification, patients are likely to have reduced tolerance to opioids. VIVITROL 
blocks the effects of exogenous opioids for approximately 28 days after administration. 
However, as the blockade wanes and eventually dissipates completely, patients who have been 
treated with VIVITROL may respond to lower doses of opioids than previously used, just as they 
would have shortly after completing detoxification.  This could result in potentially life-
threatening opioid intoxication (respiratory compromise or arrest, circulatory collapse, etc.) if the 
patient uses previously tolerated doses of opioids.  Cases of opioid overdose with fatal outcomes 
have been reported in patients who used opioids at the end of a dosing interval, after missing a 
scheduled dose, or after discontinuing treatment. 
Patients should be alerted that they may be more sensitive to opioids, even at lower doses, after 
VIVITROL treatment is discontinued, especially at the end of a dosing interval (i.e., near the end 
of the month that VIVITROL was administered), or after a dose of VIVITROL is missed.  It is 
important that patients inform family members and the people closest to the patient of this 
increased sensitivity to opioids and the risk of overdose [see Patient Counseling Information 
(17)]. 
There is also the possibility that a patient who is treated with VIVITROL could overcome the 
opioid blockade effect of VIVITROL.  Although VIVITROL is a potent antagonist with a 
prolonged pharmacological effect, the blockade produced by VIVITROL is surmountable.  The 
7 
Reference ID: 3348450 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
plasma concentration of exogenous opioids attained immediately following their acute 
administration may be sufficient to overcome the competitive receptor blockade.  This poses a 
potential risk to individuals who attempt, on their own, to overcome the blockade by 
administering large amounts of exogenous opioids.  Any attempt by a patient to overcome the 
antagonism by taking opioids is especially dangerous and may lead to life-threatening opioid 
intoxication or fatal overdose. Patients should be told of the serious consequences of trying to 
overcome the opioid blockade [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. 
5.2 
Injection Site Reactions 
VIVITROL injections may be followed by pain, tenderness, induration, swelling, erythema, 
bruising, or pruritus; however, in some cases injection site reactions may be very severe. In the 
clinical trials, one patient developed an area of induration that continued to enlarge after 4 
weeks, with subsequent development of necrotic tissue that required surgical excision.  In the 
postmarketing period, additional cases of injection site reaction with features including 
induration, cellulitis, hematoma, abscess, sterile abscess, and necrosis, have been reported.  
Some cases required surgical intervention, including debridement of necrotic tissue.  Some cases 
resulted in significant scarring. The reported cases occurred primarily in female patients.   
VIVITROL is administered as an intramuscular gluteal injection, and inadvertent subcutaneous 
injection of VIVITROL may increase the likelihood of severe injection site reactions.  The 
needles provided in the carton are customized needles.  VIVITROL must not be injected using 
any other needle. The needle lengths (either 1.5 inches or 2 inches) may not be adequate in 
every patient because of body habitus.  Body habitus should be assessed prior to each injection 
for each patient to assure that the proper needle is selected and that the needle length is adequate 
for intramuscular administration.  For patients with a larger amount of subcutaneous tissue 
overlying the gluteal muscle, the administering healthcare provider may utilize the supplied 2­
inch needle with needle protection device to help ensure that the injectate reaches the 
intramuscular mass.  For very lean patients, the 1.5-inch needle may be appropriate to prevent 
the needle contacting the periosteum.  Either needle may be used for patients with average body 
habitus. Healthcare providers should ensure that the VIVITROL injection is given correctly, and 
should consider alternate treatment for those patients whose body habitus precludes an 
intramuscular gluteal injection with one of the provided needles. 
Patients should be informed that any concerning injection site reactions should be brought to the 
attention of the healthcare provider [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Patients 
exhibiting signs of abscess, cellulitis, necrosis, or extensive swelling should be evaluated by a 
physician to determine if referral to a surgeon is warranted. 
5.3 
Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal 
The symptoms of spontaneous opioid withdrawal (which are associated with the discontinuation 
of opioid in a dependent individual) are uncomfortable, but they are not generally believed to be 
severe or necessitate hospitalization.  However, when withdrawal is precipitated abruptly by the 
administration of an opioid antagonist to an opioid-dependent patient, the resulting withdrawal 
syndrome can be severe enough to require hospitalization.  Review of postmarketing cases of

precipitated opioid withdrawal in association with naltrexone treatment has identified cases with 
symptoms of withdrawal severe enough to require hospital admission, and in some cases, 
management in the intensive care unit.   
To prevent occurrence of precipitated withdrawal in patients dependent on opioids, or 
exacerbation of a pre-existing subclinical withdrawal syndrome, opioid-dependent patients, 
including those being treated for alcohol dependence, should be opioid-free (including tramadol) 
before starting VIVITROL treatment.  An opioid-free interval of a minimum of 7–10 days is 
recommended for patients previously dependent on short-acting opioids. Patients transitioning 
from buprenorphine or methadone may be vulnerable to precipitation of withdrawal symptoms 
for as long as two weeks. 
If a more rapid transition from agonist to antagonist therapy is deemed necessary and appropriate 
by the healthcare provider, monitor the patient closely in an appropriate medical setting where 
precipitated withdrawal can be managed.    
In every case, healthcare providers should always be prepared to manage withdrawal 
symptomatically with non-opioid medications because there is no completely reliable method for 
determining whether a patient has had an adequate opioid-free period. A naloxone challenge test 
may be helpful; however, a few case reports have indicated that patients may experience 
precipitated withdrawal despite having a negative urine toxicology screen or tolerating a 
naloxone challenge test (usually in the setting of transitioning from buprenorphine treatment).  
Patients should be made aware of the risks associated with precipitated withdrawal and 
encouraged to give an accurate account of last opioid use.  Patients treated for alcohol 
dependence with VIVITROL should also be assessed for underlying opioid dependence and for 
any recent use of opioids prior to initiation of treatment with VIVITROL.  Precipitated opioid 
withdrawal has been observed in alcohol-dependent patients in circumstances where the 
prescriber had been unaware of the additional use of opioids or co-dependence on opioids. 
5.4 
Hepatotoxicity 
Cases of hepatitis and clinically significant liver dysfunction were observed in association with 
VIVITROL exposure during the clinical development program and in the postmarketing period.  
Transient, asymptomatic hepatic transaminase elevations were also observed in the clinical trials 
and postmarketing period.  Although patients with clinically significant liver disease were not 
systematically studied, clinical trials did include patients with asymptomatic viral hepatitis 
infections. When patients presented with elevated transaminases, there were often other 
potential causative or contributory etiologies identified, including pre-existing alcoholic liver 
disease, hepatitis B and/or C infection, and concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic 
drugs. Although clinically significant liver dysfunction is not typically recognized as a 
manifestation of opioid withdrawal, opioid withdrawal that is precipitated abruptly may lead to 
systemic sequelae including acute liver injury. 
Patients should be warned of the risk of hepatic injury and advised to seek medical attention if 
they experience symptoms of acute hepatitis.  Use of VIVITROL should be discontinued in the 
event of symptoms and/or signs of acute hepatitis.

5.5  
Depression and Suicidality 
Alcohol- and opioid-dependent patients, including those taking VIVITROL, should be monitored 
for the development of depression or suicidal thinking.  Families and caregivers of patients being 
treated with VIVITROL should be alerted to the need to monitor patients for the emergence of 
symptoms of depression or suicidality, and to report such symptoms to the patient’s healthcare 
provider. 
Alcohol Dependence 
In controlled clinical trials of VIVITROL administered to adults with alcohol dependence, 
adverse events of a suicidal nature (suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, completed suicides) were 
infrequent overall, but were more common in patients treated with VIVITROL than in patients 
treated with placebo (1% vs 0). In some cases, the suicidal thoughts or behavior occurred after 
study discontinuation, but were in the context of an episode of depression that began while the 
patient was on study drug. Two completed suicides occurred, both involving patients treated 
with VIVITROL. 
Depression-related events associated with premature discontinuation of study drug were also 
more common in patients treated with VIVITROL (~1%) than in placebo-treated patients (0). 
In the 24-week, placebo-controlled pivotal trial in 624 alcohol-dependent patients, adverse 
events involving depressed mood were reported by 10% of patients treated with VIVITROL 380 
mg, as compared to 5% of patients treated with placebo injections.   
Opioid Dependence 
In an open-label, long-term safety study conducted in the US, adverse events of a suicidal nature 
(depressed mood, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt) were reported by 5% of opioid-dependent 
patients treated with VIVITROL 380 mg (n=101) and 10% of opioid-dependent patients treated 
with oral naltrexone (n=20). In the 24-week, placebo-controlled pivotal trial that was conducted 
in Russia in 250 opioid-dependent patients, adverse events involving depressed mood or suicidal 
thinking were not reported by any patient in either treatment group (VIVITROL 380 mg or 
placebo).   
5.6  
When Reversal of VIVITROL Blockade Is Required for Pain  
Management 
In an emergency situation in patients receiving VIVITROL, suggestions for pain management 
include regional analgesia or use of non-opioid analgesics.  If opioid therapy is required as part 
of anesthesia or analgesia, patients should be continuously monitored in an anesthesia care 
setting by persons not involved in the conduct of the surgical or diagnostic procedure.  The 
opioid therapy must be provided by individuals specifically trained in the use of anesthetic drugs 
and the management of the respiratory effects of potent opioids, specifically the establishment 
and maintenance of a patent airway and assisted ventilation.  
Irrespective of the drug chosen to reverse VIVITROL blockade, the patient should be monitored 
closely by appropriately trained personnel in a setting equipped and staffed for cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation.

5.7 
 
Eosinophilic Pneumonia 
In clinical trials with VIVITROL, there was one diagnosed case and one suspected case of 
eosinophilic pneumonia.  Both cases required hospitalization, and resolved after treatment with 
antibiotics and corticosteroids. Similar cases have been reported in postmarketing use.  Should a 
person receiving VIVITROL develop progressive dyspnea and hypoxemia, the diagnosis of 
eosinophilic pneumonia should be considered [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Patients should be 
warned of the risk of eosinophilic pneumonia, and advised to seek medical attention should they 
develop symptoms of pneumonia.  Clinicians should consider the possibility of eosinophilic 
pneumonia in patients who do not respond to antibiotics. 
5.8 
Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis 
Cases of urticaria, angioedema, and anaphylaxis have been observed with use of VIVITROL in 
the clinical trial setting and in postmarketing use.  Patients should be warned of the risk of 
hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis.  In the event of a hypersensitivity reaction, 
patients should be advised to seek immediate medical attention in a healthcare setting prepared to 
treat anaphylaxis. The patient should not receive any further treatment with VIVITROL. 
5.9 
Intramuscular Injections 
As with any intramuscular injection, VIVITROL should be administered with caution to patients 
with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (eg, hemophilia and severe hepatic failure). 
5.10 
Alcohol Withdrawal 
Use of VIVITROL does not eliminate nor diminish alcohol withdrawal symptoms. 
5.11 
Interference with Laboratory Tests 
VIVITROL may be cross-reactive with certain immunoassay methods for the detection of drugs 
of abuse (specifically opioids) in urine.  For further information, reference to the specific 
immunoassay instructions is recommended. 
6 
ADVERSE REACTIONS 
Serious adverse reactions that may be associated with VIVITROL therapy in clinical use include: 
severe injection site reactions, eosinophilic pneumonia, serious allergic reactions, unintended 
precipitation of opioid withdrawal, accidental opioid overdose and depression and suicidality. 
The adverse events seen most frequently in association with VIVITROL therapy for alcohol 
dependence (ie, those occurring in ≥ 5% and at least twice as frequently with VIVITROL than 
placebo) include nausea, vomiting, injection site reactions (including induration, pruritus, 
nodules and swelling), muscle cramps, dizziness or syncope, somnolence or sedation, anorexia, 
decreased appetite or other appetite disorders.  
The adverse events seen most frequently in association with VIVITROL therapy in opioid-
dependent patients (ie, those occurring in ≥ 2% and at least twice as frequently with VIVITROL

than placebo) were hepatic enzyme abnormalities, injection site pain, nasopharyngitis, insomnia, 
and toothache. 
6.1 
Clinical Studies Experience 
Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates 
observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials 
of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. 
In all controlled and uncontrolled trials during the premarketing development of VIVITROL, 
more than 1100 patients with alcohol and/or opioid dependence have been treated with 
VIVITROL. Approximately 700 patients have been treated for 6 months or more, and more than 
400 for 1 year or longer. 
Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation of Treatment 
Alcohol Dependence 
In controlled trials of 6 months or less in alcohol-dependent patients, 9% of alcohol-dependent 
patients treated with VIVITROL discontinued treatment due to an adverse event, as compared to 
7% of the alcohol-dependent patients treated with placebo.  Adverse events in the VIVITROL 
380-mg group that led to more dropouts than in the placebo-treated group were injection site 
reactions (3%), nausea (2%), pregnancy (1%), headache (1%), and suicide-related events (0.3%).  
In the placebo group, 1% of patients withdrew due to injection site reactions, and 0% of patients 
withdrew due to the other adverse events. 
Opioid Dependence 
In a controlled trial of 6 months, 2% of opioid-dependent patients treated with VIVITROL 
discontinued treatment due to an adverse event, as compared to 2% of the opioid-dependent 
patients treated with placebo. 
Common Adverse Reactions 
Alcohol Dependence 
Table 1 lists all treatment-emergent clinical adverse reactions, regardless of causality, occurring 
in ≥5% of patients with alcohol dependence, for which the incidence was greater in the combined 
VIVITROL group than in the placebo group. A majority of patients treated with VIVITROL in 
clinical studies had adverse reactions with a maximum intensity of “mild” or “moderate”.

Opioid Dependence 
In the open-label, long-term safety study conducted in the US, the commonly reported adverse 
reactions among the opioid-dependent patients in the study were similar to those commonly 
observed events in the alcohol-dependent populations in VIVITROL clinical trials as displayed 
in Table 1, above. For example, injection site reactions of all types, nausea and diarrhea 
occurred in more than 5% of patients on VIVITROL in the open-label study.  In contrast, 48% 
percent, of the opioid-dependent patients had at least one adverse event in the “Infections and 
Infestations” Body System. Adverse Reactions/Preferred Terms of nasopharyngitis, upper 
respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, and sinusitis were most commonly reported.  
In the placebo-controlled study in opioid-dependent patients conducted in Russia, the overall 
frequency of adverse events was lower than in the U.S. population described above.  Table 2 lists 
treatment-emergent clinical adverse events, regardless of causality, occurring in ≥2% of patients 
with opioid dependence, for which the incidence was greater in the VIVITROL group than in the 
placebo group. All adverse events were assessed as having a maximum intensity of “mild” or 
“moderate.”

Laboratory Tests 
Eosinophil Count: 
In clinical trials, subjects on VIVITROL had increases in eosinophil counts relative to subjects 
on placebo. With continued use of VIVITROL, eosinophil counts returned to normal over a 
period of several months. 
Platelet Count: 
VIVITROL 380 mg was associated with a decrease in platelet count.  In clinical trials, alcohol-
dependent patients treated with VIVITROL experienced a mean maximal decrease in platelet 
count of 17.8 x 103/µL, compared to 2.6 x 103/µL in placebo patients.   
After 24 weeks of treatment, opioid-dependent patients treated with VIVITROL experienced a 
mean maximal decrease in platelet count of 62.8 x 103/µL, compared to 39.9 x 103/µL in placebo 
patients. In randomized controlled trials, VIVITROL was not associated with an increase in 
bleeding-related adverse events. 
Hepatic Enzyme Elevations: 
In short-term, controlled trials, in alcohol-dependent patients, the incidence of AST elevations 
associated with VIVITROL treatment was similar to that observed with oral naltrexone treatment 
(1.5% each) and slightly higher than observed with placebo treatment (0.9%). 
In the 6-month controlled trial conducted in opioid-dependent subjects, 89% had a baseline 
diagnosis of hepatitis C infection, and 41% had a baseline diagnosis of HIV infection.  There 
were frequently observed elevated liver enzyme levels (ALT, AST, and GGT); these were more 
commonly reported as adverse events in the VIVITROL 380-mg group than in the placebo 
group. Patients could not enroll in this trial if they had a baseline ALT or AST value that was 
more than three times the upper limit of normal.  More patients treated with VIVITROL in this 
study experienced treatment-emergent elevations in transaminases to more than three times the 
upper limit of normal than patients treated with placebo.  Shifts to more than three times the 
upper limit of normal occurred in 20% of patients treated with VIVITROL as compared with 
13% of placebo patients. Shifts in values of AST to more than three times the upper limit were 
also more common in the VIVITROL (14%) arm compared with the placebo (11%) arm.  
Opioid-dependent patients treated with VIVITROL experienced a mean maximal increase from 
baseline ALT levels of 61 IU/L compared with 48 IU/L in placebo patients.  Similarly for AST, 
opioid-dependent patients treated with VIVITROL experienced a mean maximal increase from 
baseline AST levels of 40 IU/L compared with 31 IU/L in placebo patients.  
Creatinine Phosphokinase: 
In short-term controlled trials in alcohol-dependent patients, more patients treated with 
VIVITROL 380 mg (11%) and oral naltrexone (17%) shifted from normal creatinine 
phosphokinase (CPK) levels before treatment to abnormal CPK levels at the end of the trials, 
compared to placebo patients (8%).  In open-label trials, 16% of patients dosed for more than 6 
months had increases in CPK. For both the oral naltrexone and VIVITROL 380-mg groups, 
CPK abnormalities were most frequently in the range of 1–2 x ULN.  However, there were 
16 
Reference ID: 3348450 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reports of CPK abnormalities as high as 4x ULN for the oral naltrexone group, and 35 x ULN for 
the VIVITROL 380-mg group.  Overall, there were no differences between the placebo and 
naltrexone (oral or injectable) groups with respect to the proportions of patients with a CPK 
value at least three times the upper limit of normal.  No factors other than naltrexone exposure 
were associated with the CPK elevations. 
More opioid-dependent patients treated with VIVITROL 380-mg (39%) shifted from normal 
creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) levels before treatment to abnormal CPK levels during the study 
as compared to patients treated with placebo (32%).  There were reports of CPK abnormalities as 
high as 41.8 x ULN for the placebo group, and 22.1 x ULN for the VIVITROL 380-mg group.

Postmarketing Reports 


Hypersensitivity Reactions including Anaphylaxis 

Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis have been reported during postmarketing 
surveillance. 
Reports From Other Intramuscular Drug Products Containing Polylactide-co-glycolide 
(PLG) Microspheres 
Retinal Artery Occlusion 
Retinal artery occlusion after injection with another drug product containing polylactide-co­
glycolide (PLG) microspheres has been reported very rarely during postmarketing surveillance.  
This event has been reported in the presence of abnormal arteriovenous anastomosis.  No cases 
of retinal artery occlusion have been reported during VIVITROL clinical trials or postmarketing 
surveillance. VIVITROL should be administered by intramuscular (IM) injection into the gluteal 
muscle, and care must be taken to avoid inadvertent injection into a blood vessel [see Dosage 
and Administration (2)]. 
7 
DRUG INTERACTIONS 
Patients taking VIVITROL may not benefit from opioid-containing medicines.  Naltrexone 
antagonizes the effects of opioid-containing medicines, such as cough and cold remedies, 
antidiarrheal preparations and opioid analgesics.

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 
8.1 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of either naltrexone or VIVITROL in pregnant 
women.  VIVITROL should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the 
potential risk to the fetus. 
18 
Reference ID: 3348450 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy Category C: Reproduction and developmental studies have not been conducted for 
VIVITROL. Studies with naltrexone administered via the oral route have been conducted in 
pregnant rats and rabbits. 
Teratogenic Effects:  Naltrexone has been shown to increase the incidence of early fetal loss 
when given to rats at doses ≥30 mg/kg/day (11 times the human exposure based on an AUC(0-28d) 
comparison) and to rabbits at oral doses ≥60 mg/kg/day (2 times the human exposure based on 
an AUC(0-28d) comparison). 
There was no evidence of teratogenicity when naltrexone was administered orally to rats and 
rabbits during the period of major organogenesis at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (175- and 14­
times the human exposure based on an AUC(0-28d) comparison, respectively). 
8.2 
Labor and Delivery 
The potential effect of VIVITROL on duration of labor and delivery in humans is unknown. 
8.3 
Nursing Mothers 
Transfer of naltrexone and 6β-naltrexol into human milk has been reported with oral naltrexone.  
Because of the potential for tumorigenicity shown for naltrexone in animal studies, and because 
of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from VIVITROL, a decision 
should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account 
the importance of the drug to the mother. 
8.4 
Pediatric Use 
The safety and efficacy of VIVITROL have not been established in the pediatric population.  The 
pharmacokinetics of VIVITROL have not been evaluated in a pediatric population. 
8.5 
Geriatric Use 
In trials of alcohol-dependent subjects, 2.6% (n=26) of subjects were >65 years of age, and one 
patient was >75 years of age.  Clinical studies of VIVITROL did not include sufficient numbers 
of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.  
No subjects over age 65 were included in studies of opioid-dependent subjects.  The 
pharmacokinetics of VIVITROL have not been evaluated in the geriatric population. 
8.6 
Renal Impairment 
Pharmacokinetics of VIVITROL are not altered in subjects with mild renal insufficiency 
(creatinine clearance of 50-80 mL/min).  Dose adjustment is not required in patients with mild 
renal impairment.  VIVITROL pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated in subjects with 
moderate and severe renal insufficiency.  Because naltrexone and its primary metabolite are 
excreted primarily in the urine, caution is recommended in administering VIVITROL to patients 
with moderate to severe renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 
19
 
Reference ID: 3348450 
  
 
 
 
 
8.7 
Hepatic Impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of VIVITROL are not altered in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic 
impairment (Groups A and B of the Child-Pugh classification).  Dose adjustment is not required 
in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment.  VIVITROL pharmacokinetics were not 
evaluated in subjects with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 
10 
OVERDOSAGE 
There is limited experience with overdose of VIVITROL.  Single doses up to 784 mg were 
administered to 5 healthy subjects.  There were no serious or severe adverse events.  The most 
common effects were injection site reactions, nausea, abdominal pain, somnolence, and 
dizziness.  There were no significant increases in hepatic enzymes. 
In the event of an overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated.

DESCRIPTION 
VIVITROL® (naltrexone for extended-release injectable suspension) is supplied as a 
microsphere formulation of naltrexone for suspension, to be administered by intramuscular 
injection. Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist with little, if any, opioid agonist activity. 
Naltrexone is designated chemically as morphinan-6-one, 17 (cyclopropylmethyl) 4,5-epoxy­
3,14-dihydroxy-(5α) (CAS Registry # 16590-41-3). The molecular formula is C20H23NO4 and its 
molecular weight is 341.41 in the anhydrous form (ie, < 1% maximum water content).  The 
structural formula is: 
Naltrexone base anhydrous is an off-white to a light tan powder with a melting point of 168­
170ºC (334-338ºF). It is insoluble in water and is soluble in ethanol. 
VIVITROL is provided as a carton containing a vial each of VIVITROL microspheres and 
diluent, one 5-mL syringe, one 1-inch 20-gauge preparation needle, two 1.5-inch 20-gauge and 
two 2-inch 20-gauge administration needles with needle protection device. 
VIVITROL microspheres consist of a sterile, off-white to light tan powder that is available in a 
dosage strength of 380 mg of naltrexone per vial.  Naltrexone is incorporated in 75:25 
20 
Reference ID: 3348450 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
polylactide-co-glycolide (PLG) at a concentration of 337 mg of naltrexone per gram of 
microspheres. 
The diluent is a clear, colorless solution.  The composition of the diluent includes 
carboxymethylcellulose sodium salt, polysorbate 20, sodium chloride, and water for injection.  
The microspheres must be suspended in the diluent prior to injection. 
12 
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
12.1 
Mechanism of action 
Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist with highest affinity for the mu opioid receptor.  Naltrexone 
has little or no opioid agonist activity.   
Naltrexone has few, if any, intrinsic actions besides its opioid blocking properties.  However, it 
does produce some pupillary constriction, by an unknown mechanism. 
12.2 
Pharmacodynamics 
The administration of VIVITROL is not associated with the development of tolerance or 
dependence.  In subjects physically dependent on opioids, VIVITROL will precipitate 
withdrawal symptomatology. 
Occupation of opioid receptors by naltrexone may block the effects of endogenous opioid 
peptides.  It markedly attenuates or completely blocks, reversibly, the subjective effects of 
exogenous opioids. The neurobiological mechanisms responsible for the reduction in alcohol 
consumption observed in alcohol-dependent patients treated with naltrexone are not entirely 
understood. However, involvement of the endogenous opioid system is suggested by preclinical 
data. 
Naltrexone blocks the effects of opioids by competitive binding at opioid receptors.  This makes 
the blockade produced potentially surmountable, but overcoming full naltrexone blockade by 
administration of opioids may result in non-opioid receptor-mediated symptoms such as 
histamine release. 
VIVITROL is not aversive therapy and does not cause a disulfiram-like reaction either as a result 
of opiate use or ethanol ingestion. 
12.3 
Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
VIVITROL is an extended-release, microsphere formulation of naltrexone designed to be 
administered by intramuscular (IM) gluteal injection every 4 weeks or once a month.  After IM 
injection, the naltrexone plasma concentration time profile is characterized by a transient initial 
peak, which occurs approximately 2 hours after injection, followed by a second peak observed 
approximately 2-3 days later.  Beginning approximately 14 days after dosing, concentrations 
slowly decline, with measurable levels for greater than 1 month. 
21 
Reference ID: 3348450 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC) for naltrexone and 6β­
naltrexol (the major metabolite) following VIVITROL administration are dose proportional.  
Compared to daily oral dosing with naltrexone 50 mg over 28 days, total naltrexone exposure is 
3 to 4-fold higher following administration of a single dose of VIVITROL 380 mg.  Steady state 
is reached at the end of the dosing interval following the first injection.  There is minimal 
accumulation (<15%) of naltrexone or 6β-naltrexol upon repeat administration of VIVITROL. 
Distribution 
In vitro data demonstrate that naltrexone plasma protein binding is low (21%). 
Metabolism 
Naltrexone is extensively metabolized in humans.  Production of the primary metabolite, 
6β-naltrexol, is mediated by dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, a cytosolic family of enzymes.  The 
cytochrome P450 system is not involved in naltrexone metabolism.  Two other minor 
metabolites are 2-hydroxy-3-methoxy-6β-naltrexol and 2-hydroxy-3-methoxy-naltrexone.  
Naltrexone and its metabolites are also conjugated to form glucuronide products. 
Significantly less 6β-naltrexol is generated following IM administration of VIVITROL compared 
to administration of oral naltrexone due to a reduction in first-pass hepatic metabolism. 
Elimination 
Elimination of naltrexone and its metabolites occurs primarily via urine, with minimal excretion 
of unchanged naltrexone. 
The elimination half life of naltrexone following VIVITROL administration is 5-10 days and is 
dependent on the erosion of the polymer.  The elimination half life of 6β-naltrexol following 
VIVITROL administration is 5-10 days. 
Special Populations 
Pediatric: Pharmacokinetics of VIVITROL have not been evaluated in a pediatric population. 
Geriatric: Pharmacokinetics of VIVITROL have not been evaluated in the geriatric population 
[see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. 
Race: Effect of race on the pharmacokinetics of VIVITROL has not been studied. 
Gender: In a study in healthy subjects (n=18 females and 18 males), gender did not influence the 
pharmacokinetics of VIVITROL.   
Renal Insufficiency: A population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated mild renal insufficiency 
(creatinine clearance of 50-80 mL/min) had little or no influence on VIVITROL 
pharmacokinetics and that no dosage adjustment is necessary.  VIVITROL pharmacokinetics 
have not been evaluated in subjects with moderate and severe renal insufficiency [see Use in 
Specific Populations (8.6)]. 
Hepatic Insufficiency: The pharmacokinetics of VIVITROL are not altered in subjects with mild 
to moderate hepatic impairment (Groups A and B of the Child-Pugh classification).  VIVITROL 
pharmacokinetics were not evaluated in subjects with severe hepatic impairment [see Use in 
Specific Populations (8.7)].

Drug Interactions 
In vitro Studies: Because naltrexone is not a substrate for CYP drug metabolizing enzymes, 
inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes are unlikely to change the clearance of VIVITROL.  An 
in vitro CYP inhibition study demonstrated that naltrexone is not an inhibitor of major CYP 
enzymes (CYP 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4).  An in vitro CYP induction 
study demonstrated that naltrexone is not an inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP1A2.

NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 
13.1 
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility 
Carcinogenesis: Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with VIVITROL.   
Carcinogenicity studies of oral naltrexone hydrochloride (administered via the diet) have been 
conducted in rats and mice.   
In a two-year carcinogenicity study in rats, there were small increases in the numbers of 
testicular mesotheliomas in males and tumors of vascular origin in males and females.  The 
incidence of testicular mesothelioma in males given naltrexone at a dietary dose of 100 
mg/kg/day (3-times the human exposure based on an AUC(0-28d) comparison) was 6%, compared 
with a maximum historical incidence of 4%.  The incidence of vascular tumors in males and 
females given dietary doses of 100 mg/kg/day was 4% but only the incidence in females was 
increased compared with a maximum historical control incidence of 2% (3 and 32 times the 
human exposure based on an AUC(0-28d) comparison in males and females, respectively).  There 
was no evidence of carcinogenicity in a 2-year dietary study with naltrexone in male and female 
mice (12 and 3 times the human exposure based on an AUC(0-28d) comparison, respectively).  The 
clinical significance of these findings is not known. 
Mutagenesis: Naltrexone was negative in the following in vitro genotoxicity studies: bacterial 
reverse mutation assay (Ames test), the heritable translocation assay, CHO cell sister chromatid 
exchange assay, and the mouse lymphoma gene mutation assay.  Naltrexone was also negative in 
an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay.  In contrast, naltrexone tested positive in the following 
assays: Drosophila recessive lethal frequency assay, non-specific DNA damage in repair tests 
with E. coli and WI-38 cells, and urinalysis for methylated histidine residues. 
Impairment of Fertility:  Naltrexone given via oral gavage caused a significant increase in 
pseudopregnancy and a decrease in pregnancy rates in rats at 100 mg/kg/day (75 times the 
human exposure based on an AUC(0-28d) comparison).  There was no effect on male fertility at 
this dose level (6 times the human exposure based on an AUC(0-28d) comparison). The relevance 
of these observations to human fertility is not known.

CLINICAL STUDIES 
Alcohol Dependence 
The efficacy of VIVITROL in the treatment of alcohol dependence was evaluated in a 24-week, 
placebo-controlled, multi-center, double-blind, randomized trial of alcohol-dependent (DSM-IV 
23 
Reference ID: 3348450 
  
 
 
 
 
criteria) outpatients. Subjects were treated with an injection every 4 weeks of VIVITROL 190 
mg, VIVITROL 380 mg or placebo.  Oral naltrexone was not administered prior to the initial or 
subsequent injections of study medication.  Psychosocial support was provided to all subjects in 
addition to medication. 
Subjects treated with VIVITROL 380 mg demonstrated a greater reduction in days of heavy 
drinking than those treated with placebo.  Heavy drinking was defined as self-report of 5 or more 
standard drinks consumed on a given day for male patients and 4 or more drinks for female 
patients. Among the subset of patients (n=53, 8% of the total study population) who abstained 
completely from drinking during the week prior to the first dose of medication, compared with 
placebo-treated patients, those treated with VIVITROL 380 mg had greater reductions in the 
number of drinking days and the number of heavy drinking days.  In this subset, patients treated 
with VIVITROL were also more likely than placebo-treated patients to maintain complete 
abstinence throughout treatment.  The same treatment effects were not evident among the subset 
of patients (n=571, 92% of the total study population) who were actively drinking at the time of 
treatment initiation. 
Opioid Dependence 
The efficacy of VIVITROL in the treatment of opioid dependence was evaluated in a 24-week, 
placebo-controlled, multi-center, double-blind, randomized trial of opioid-dependent (DSM-IV) 
outpatients, who were completing or had recently completed detoxification.  Subjects were 
treated with an injection every 4 weeks of VIVITROL 380 mg or placebo.  Oral naltrexone was 
not administered prior to the initial or subsequent injections of study medication.  Standardized, 
manual-based psychosocial support was provided on a biweekly basis to all subjects in addition 
to medication.  
Figure 1, below, displays the cumulative percentage of subjects with opioid-free weeks ranging 
from no visits (0%) to all visits (100%). An opioid-free week was one in which urine drug test 
results were negative for opioids and self-reported opioid use was also zero.  An initial period of 
engagement in treatment was permitted during which opiate use, if it occurred, was not 
considered in the analysis. Subjects discontinuing from the trial were assumed to have had 
opioid-use weeks for the weeks after dropout. 
The cumulative percentage of subjects achieving each observed percentage of opioid-free weeks 
was greater in the VIVITROL group compared to the placebo group.  Complete abstinence 
(opioid-free at all weekly visits) was sustained by 23% of subjects in the placebo group 
compared with 36% of subjects in the VIVITROL group from Week 5 to Week 24.

PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION 
See FDA-Approved Medication Guide. 
17.1 
Patient Information 
Physicians should include the following issues in discussions with patients for whom they 
prescribe VIVITROL: 
•  Advise patients that if they previously used opioids, they may be more sensitive to 
lower doses of opioids and at risk of accidental overdose should they use opioids 
when their next dose is due, if they miss a dose, or after VIVITROL treatment is 
discontinued. It is important that patients inform family members and the people 
closest to the patient of this increased sensitivity to opioids and the risk of overdose. 
•  Advise patients that because VIVITROL can block the effects of opioids, patients 
will not perceive any effect if they attempt to self-administer heroin or any other 
opioid drug in small doses while on VIVITROL.  Further, emphasize that 
administration of large doses of heroin or any other opioid to try to bypass the 
blockade and get high while on VIVITROL may lead to serious injury, coma, or 
death. 
•  Patients on VIVITROL may not experience the expected effects from opioid-
containing analgesic, antidiarrheal, or antitussive medications. 
•  Advise patients that a reaction at the site of VIVITROL injection may occur.  
Reactions include pain, tenderness, induration, swelling, erythema, bruising, or 
pruritus. Serious injection site reactions including necrosis may occur.  Some of 
these injection site reactions have required surgery.  Patients should receive their 
injection from a healthcare provider qualified to administer the injection.  Patients 
should be advised to seek medical attention for worsening skin reactions. 
•  Advise patients that they should be off all opioids, including opioid-containing 
medicines, for a minimum of 7 – 10 days before starting VIVITROL in order to avoid 
precipitation of opioid withdrawal.  Patients transitioning from buprenorphine or 
methadone may be vulnerable to precipitation of withdrawal symptoms for as long as 
two weeks. Ensure that patients understand that withdrawal precipitated by 
administration of an opioid antagonist may be severe enough to require 
hospitalization if they have not been opioid-free for an adequate period of time, and is 
different from the experience of spontaneous withdrawal that occurs with 
discontinuation of opioid in a dependent individual.  Advise patients that they should 
not take VIVITROL if they have any symptoms of opioid withdrawal.  Advise all 
patients, including those with alcohol dependence, that it is imperative to notify 
26 
Reference ID: 3348450 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
healthcare providers of any recent use of opioids or any history of opioid dependence 
before starting VIVITROL to avoid precipitation of opioid withdrawal. 
•  Advise patients that VIVITROL may cause liver injury.  Patients should immediately 
notify their physician if they develop symptoms and/or signs of liver disease. 
•  Advise patients that they may experience depression while taking VIVITROL.  It is 
important that patients inform family members and the people closest to the patient 
that they are taking VIVITROL and that they should call a doctor right away should 
they become depressed or experience symptoms of depression. 
•  Advise patients to carry documentation to alert medical personnel to the fact that they 
are taking VIVITROL (naltrexone for extended-release injectable suspension).  This 
will help to ensure that patients obtain adequate medical treatment in an emergency. 
•  Advise patients that VIVITROL may cause an allergic pneumonia.  Patients should 
immediately notify their physician if they develop signs and symptoms of pneumonia, 
including dyspnea, coughing, or wheezing. 
•  Advise patients that they should not take VIVITROL if they are allergic to 
VIVITROL or any of the microsphere or diluent components.  
•  Advise patients that they may experience nausea following the initial injection of 
VIVITROL. These episodes of nausea tend to be mild and subside within a few days 
post-injection.  Patients are less likely to experience nausea in subsequent injections.  
Patients should be advised that they may also experience tiredness, headache, 
vomiting, decreased appetite, painful joints and muscle cramps.  
•  Advise patients that because VIVITROL is an intramuscular injection and not an 
implanted device, once VIVITROL is injected, it is not possible to remove it from the 
body. 
•  Advise patients that VIVITROL has been shown to treat alcohol and opioid 
dependence only when used as part of a treatment program that includes counseling 
and support. 
•  Advise patients that dizziness may occur with VIVITROL treatment, and they should 
avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until they have determined how 
VIVITROL affects them. 
•  Advise patients to notify their physician if they: 
− become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with VIVITROL. 
− are breast-feeding. 
− experience respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, coughing, or wheezing when 
taking VIVITROL. 
− experience any allergic reactions when taking VIVITROL. 
− experience other unusual or significant side effects while on VIVITROL therapy.

17.2 
Frequently Asked Questions About Administering VIVITROL: 
1. Can I prepare the suspension prior to my patient’s arrival? 
No. You may remove the carton from the refrigerator prior to the patient’s arrival, but once 
the diluent is added to the VIVITROL microspheres, the dose should be mixed and the 
suspension administered immediately. It is very important to use proper aseptic technique 
when preparing the suspension [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 
2. How much time do I have between preparing and administering the dose? 
It is recommended that the suspension be administered immediately once the product has 
been suspended and transferred into the syringe. If a few minutes’ delay occurs after 
suspension but before transfer into the syringe [see Dosage and Administration (2.4; Figure 
D)], the vial can be inverted a few times to resuspend and then transferred into the syringe 
for immediate use [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 
3. Can I use needles other than those provided in the carton? 
No. The needles in the carton are specially designed for administration of VIVITROL. Do 
not make any substitutions for components of the carton [see Dosage and Administration 
(2.4)]. 
4. The suspension is milky white upon mixing with the diluent. Is this normal? 
Yes. VIVITROL microspheres will form a milky suspension when mixed with the provided 
diluent [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 
5. What if a needle clog occurs during administration of the product? 
If a clog occurs during administration, the needle should be withdrawn from the patient, 
capped with the attached needle protection device, and replaced with the spare administration 
needle. Gently push on the plunger until a bead of the suspension appears at the tip of the 
needle. The remainder of the suspension should then be administered into an adjacent site in 
the same gluteal region [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

MEDICATION GUIDE 

VIVITROL® (viv-i-trol) 
(naltrexone for extended-release injectable suspension) 

Read this Medication Guide before you start receiving VIVITROL injections and each 
time you receive an injection.  There may be new information.  This information 
does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical 
condition or your treatment. 
What is the most important information I should know about VIVITROL? 
VIVITROL can cause serious side effects, including: 
1. Risk of opioid overdose. 
You can accidentally overdose in two ways. 
•  VIVITROL blocks the effects of opioids, such as heroin or opioid pain 
medicines.  Do not take large amounts of opioids, including opioid-
containing medicines, such as heroin or prescription pain pills, to try to 
overcome the opioid-blocking effects of VIVITROL.  This can lead to serious 
injury, coma, or death. 
•  After you receive a dose of VIVITROL, its blocking effect slowly decreases 
and completely goes away over time.  If you have used opioid street drugs or 
opioid-containing medicines in the past, using opioids in amounts that you 
used before treatment with VIVITROL can lead to overdose and death.  You 
may also be more sensitive to the effects of lower amounts of opioids: 
o  after you have gone through detoxification 
o  when your next VIVITROL dose is due 
o  if you miss a dose of VIVITROL 
o  after you stop VIVITROL treatment 
It is important that you tell your family and the people closest to you of this 
increased sensitivity to opioids and the risk of overdose. 
You or someone close to you should get emergency medical help right 
away if you: 
• 
have trouble breathing 
• 
become very drowsy with slowed breathing 
• 
have slow, shallow breathing (little chest movement with breathing) 
• 
feel faint, very dizzy, confused, or have unusual symptoms 
2. Severe reactions at the site of the injection (injection site reactions). 
Some people on VIVITROL have had severe injection site reactions, including 
tissue death (necrosis).  Some of these injection site reactions have required 
surgery. Call your healthcare provider right away if you notice any of the 
following at any of your injection sites:

•  intense pain 
• 
blisters 
•  the area feels hard 
• 
an open wound 
•  large area of swelling 
• 
a dark scab   
•  lumps 
Tell your healthcare provider about any reaction at an injection site that 
concerns you, gets worse over time, or does not get better by two weeks after 
the injection. 
3.  Sudden opioid withdrawal.   
Anyone who receives a VIVITROL injection must not use any type of opioid 
(must be opioid-free) including street drugs, prescription pain medicines, 
cough,cold, or diarrhea medicines that contain opioids, or opioid dependence 
treatments, buprenorphine or methadone, for at least 7 to 14 days before 
starting VIVITROL.  Using opioids in the 7 to 14 days before you start receiving 
VIVITROL may cause you to suddenly have symptoms of opioid withdrawal when 
you get the VIVITROL injection. Sudden opioid withdrawal can be severe, 
and you may need to go to the hospital. 
You must be opioid-free before receiving VIVITROL unless your healthcare 
provider decides that you don’t need to go through detox first. Instead, your 
doctor may decide to give your VIVITROL injection in a medical facility that can 
treat you for sudden opioid withdrawal. 
4.  Liver damage or hepatitis.  Naltrexone, the active ingredient in VIVITROL, 
can cause liver damage or hepatitis. 
Tell your healthcare provider if you have any of the following symptoms of liver 
problems during treatment with VIVITROL:  
•  stomach area pain lasting more than a few days 
•  dark urine 
•  yellowing of the whites of your eyes 
•  tiredness 
Your healthcare provider may need to stop treating you with VIVITROL if you get 
signs or symptoms of a serious liver problem.  
What is VIVITROL? 
VIVITROL is a prescription injectable medicine used to: 
•  treat alcohol dependence.  You should stop drinking before starting VIVITROL. 
•  prevent relapse to opioid dependence, after opioid detoxification.  
This means that if you take opioids or opioid-containing medicines, you must 
stop taking them before you start receiving VIVITROL.  See “What is the most 
important information I should know about VIVITROL?” 
To be effective, treatment with VIVITROL must be used with other alcohol or drug 
recovery programs such as counseling.  VIVITROL may not work for everyone.

It is not known if VIVITROL is safe and effective in children. 

Who should not receive VIVITROL? 
Do not receive VIVITROL if you: 
•  are using or have a physical dependence on opioid-containing medicines or 
opioid street drugs.  See “What is the most important information I should 
know about VIVITROL?” 
To see whether you have a physical dependence on opioid-containing medicines 
or opioid street drugs, your healthcare provider may give you a small injection 
of a medicine called naloxone.  This is called a naloxone challenge test. If you 
get symptoms of opioid withdrawal after the naloxone challenge test, 
do not start treatment with VIVITROL at that time.  Your healthcare 
provider may repeat the test after you have stopped using opioids to see 
whether it is safe to start VIVITROL. 
•  are having opioid withdrawal symptoms. Opioid withdrawal symptoms may 
happen when you have been taking opioid-containing medicines or opioid street 
drugs regularly and then stop. 
Symptoms of opioid withdrawal may include: anxiety, sleeplessness, 
yawning, fever, sweating, teary eyes, runny nose, goose bumps, shakiness, hot 
or cold flushes, muscle aches, muscle twitches, restlessness, nausea and 
vomiting, diarrhea, or stomach cramps.  See “What is the most important 
information I should know about VIVITROL?”  Tell your healthcare provider 
if you have any of these symptoms before taking VIVITROL. 
•  are allergic to naltrexone or any of the ingredients in VIVITROL or the liquid 
used to mix VIVITROL (diluent).  See the end of this Medication Guide for a 
complete list of ingredients in VIVITROL and the diluent. 
What should I tell my healthcare provider before receiving VIVITROL? 
Before you receive VIVITROL, tell your healthcare provider if you: 
•  have liver problems 
•  use or abuse street (illegal) drugs 
•  have hemophilia or other bleeding problems 
•  have kidney problems 
•  have any other medical conditions 
•  are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.  It is not known if VIVITROL will harm 
your unborn baby. 
•  are breastfeeding. It is not known if VIVITROL passes into your milk, and if it 
can harm your baby.  Naltrexone, the active ingredient in VIVITROL, is the same 
active ingredient in tablets taken by mouth that contain naltrexone.  Naltrexone 
from tablets passes into breast milk.  Talk to your healthcare provider about 
whether you will breastfeed or take VIVITROL.  You should not do both.

Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including 
prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. 
Especially tell your healthcare provider if you take any opioid-containing medicines 
for pain, cough or colds, or diarrhea.  See “What is the most important 
information I should know about VIVITROL?” 
If you are being treated for alcohol dependence but also use or are 
addicted to opioid-containing medicines or opioid street drugs, it is 
important that you tell your healthcare provider before starting VIVITROL 
to avoid having sudden opioid withdrawal symptoms when you start 
VIVITROL treatment. 
Know the medicines you take.  Keep a list of them to show your healthcare provider 
and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. 
How will I receive VIVITROL? 
•  VIVITROL is injected by a healthcare provider, about 1 time each month. 
•  VIVITROL is given as an injection into a muscle in your buttocks using a special 
needle that comes with VIVITROL.  
•  After VIVITROL is injected, it lasts for a month and it cannot be removed from 
the body. 
•  If you miss your appointment for your VIVITROL injection, schedule another 
appointment as soon as possible.  See “What is the most important 
information I should know about VIVITROL?” 
•  Whenever you need medical treatment, be sure to tell the treating healthcare 
provider that you are receiving VIVITROL injections and mention when you got 
your last dose.  This is important because VIVITROL can also block the effects of 
opioid-containing medicines that might be prescribed for you for pain, cough or 
colds, or diarrhea. 
•  Carry written information with you at all times to alert healthcare providers that 
you are taking VIVITROL, so that they can treat you properly in an emergency. 
Ask your healthcare provider how you can get a wallet card to carry with you.  
What should I avoid while receiving VIVITROL? 
Do not drive a car, operate machinery, or do other dangerous activities until you 
know how VIVITROL affects you.  VIVITROL may make you feel dizzy and sleepy.

IMPORTANT DRUG WARNING 
Subject:  
Important safety information being added to Prescribing Information and
 
Medication Guide for VIVITROL®
 
(naltrexone for extended-release injectable suspension) 

Dear Healthcare Provider: 
The purpose of this letter is to inform you of important new safety information for VIVITROL 
(naltrexone for extended-release injectable suspension). VIVITROL is a prescription injectable 
medication indicated for the treatment of alcohol dependence and for the prevention of relapse to 
opioid dependence, following opioid detoxification. 
The Food and Drug Administration has updated the Prescribing Information and Medication 
Guide for VIVITROL. 
The primary changes to the Prescribing Information address the following safety issues: 
Risk of Opioid Overdose 
•  Patients treated with VIVITROL may be sensitive to lower doses of opioids, and at risk of 
opioid overdose, should they use opioids at the end of a dosing interval, after missing a 
scheduled dose, or after discontinuing treatment. See Warnings and Precautions, Vulnerability 
to Opioid Overdose, Section 5.1. 
•  Advise patients that if they previously used opioids, they may be sensitive to lower doses of 
opioids and at risk of accidental overdose should they use opioids at the end of a dosing 
interval, after missing a scheduled dose, or after discontinuing treatment; See Patient 
Counseling Information, Patient Information, Section 17.1. 
•  Emphasize the risk of serious injury, coma, or death if patients administer large doses of 
opioids to try to bypass the blockade and get high while on VIVITROL; See Patient 
Counseling Information, Patient Information, Section 17.1. 

Precipitated Withdrawal 
Review of postmarketing reports for precipitated withdrawal occurring with VIVITROL, oral 
naltrexone, and other opioid antagonists in FDA’s Adverse Event Reporting System and the 
medical literature highlighted the potentially severe clinical manifestations of precipitated 
withdrawal that may occur when opioid antagonist therapy is initiated in close proximity to opioid 
agonist therapy or use of illicit opioids. The following language is being added to labeling to 
highlight this risk. 
•  The symptoms of precipitated opioid withdrawal, caused by administration of an opioid 
Reference ID: 3348450 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
antagonist to an opioid-dependent patient, can be severe enough to require hospitalization. See 
Warnings and Precautions, Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal, Section 5.3. 
•  To prevent occurrence of precipitated withdrawal in patients previously dependent on short-
acting opioids, an opioid-free interval of a minimum of 7–10 days is recommended before 
starting VIVITROL treatment. See Warnings and Precautions, Precipitation of Opioid 
Withdrawal, Section 5.3; and Dosage and Administration, Section 2. 
•  Patients transitioning from buprenorphine or methadone to VIVITROL may be vulnerable to 
precipitation of withdrawal symptoms for as long as two weeks. See Warnings and 
Precautions, Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal, Section 5.3; and Dosage and 
Administration, Switching from Buprenorphine, Buprenorphine/Naloxone, or Methadone, 
Section 2.3. 
•  If a more rapid transition from agonist to antagonist therapy is deemed necessary and 
appropriate by a healthcare provider, the patient should be monitored closely in an appropriate 
medical setting where precipitated withdrawal can be managed. See Warnings and 
Precautions, Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal, Section 5.3. 
•  Healthcare providers should always be prepared to manage withdrawal symptomatically with 
non-opioid medications because there is no reliable method for determining whether a patient 
has had an adequate opioid-free period before starting treatment with VIVITROL. See 
Warnings and Precautions, Precipitation of Opioid Withdrawal, Section 5.3. 
•  Advise patients that they should be opioid-free for a minimum of 7–10 days, and as long as 
two weeks when transitioning from buprenorphine or methadone, before starting treatment 
with VIVITROL, and ensure that patients understand that precipitated withdrawal is different 
from spontaneous withdrawal and may be severe enough to require hospitalization; See 
Patient Counseling Information, Patient Information, Section 17.1. 
Injection Site Reactions 
•  In order to minimize the risk of injection site reactions, language has been added to describe 
the appropriate selection of size of administration needles (1.5” or 2”) based on patient body
 
habitus. See Warnings and Precautions, Section 5.2; Dosage and Administration, Section 2; 
Directions for Use, Section 2.4. 
•  In order to emphasize the importance of proper injection technique, a poster titled Key 
Techniques to Reduce Severe Injection Site Reactions is being made available to prescribers. 
Hepatotoxicity 
•  The Boxed Warning has been removed and the section on Hepatotoxicity within the Warnings 
and Precautions section of the label has been revised to reflect clinical development and 
postmarketing experience. See Warnings and Precautions, Hepatotoxicity, Section 5.4. 
The VIVITROL Medication Guide has also been revised. Please review the revised Medication 
Guide with your patients. Primary changes include the following risks associated with the use of 
VIVITROL under “What is the most important information I should know about VIVITROL?” 
1.  Risk of opioid overdose 
2.  Severe reactions at the site of injection (injection site reactions) 
3.  Sudden opioid withdrawal 
4.  Liver damage or hepatitis
