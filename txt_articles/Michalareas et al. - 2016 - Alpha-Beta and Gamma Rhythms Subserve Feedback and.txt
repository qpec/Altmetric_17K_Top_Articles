In Brief
Michalareas et al. show that in human
visual cortex influences along
feedforward projections predominate in
the gamma band, whereas influences
along feedback projections predominate
in the alpha-beta band. These influences
constrain a functional hierarchy in
agreement with macaque anatomical
hierarchy.

SUMMARY
Primate visual cortex is hierarchically organized.
Bottom-up and top-down influences are exerted
through distinct frequency channels, as was recently
revealed in macaques by correlating inter-areal influ-
ences with laminar anatomical projection patterns.
Because this anatomical data cannot be obtained
in human subjects, we selected seven homologous
macaque and human visual areas, and we correlated
the macaque laminar projection patterns to human
inter-areal directed influences as measured with
magnetoencephalography. We show that influences
along feedforward projections predominate in the
gamma band, whereas influences along feedback
projections predominate in the alpha-beta band.
Rhythmic inter-areal influences constrain a func-
tional hierarchy of the seven homologous human
visual areas that is in close agreement with the
respective macaque anatomical hierarchy. Rhythmic
influences allow an extension of the hierarchy to 26
human visual areas including uniquely human brain
areas. Hierarchical levels of ventral- and dorsal-
stream visual areas are differentially affected by in-
ter-areal influences in the alpha-beta band.
INTRODUCTION
Non-human primate visual cortical areas are organized in a hier-
archy with characteristic laminar patterns of feedforward and
feedback projections (Felleman and Van Essen, 1991; Barone
et al., 2000; Markov et al., 2014). Feedforward projections typi-
cally target layer 4. They originate predominantly from superficial
layers, and this predominance increases with the number of hier-
archical levels bridged by the projection. By contrast, feedback
projections typically target layers 1 and 6. They originate pre-
dominantly from infragranular layers, and this predominance in-
creases with the number of hierarchical levels bridged by the
projection. In agreement with this, contextual feedback signals
activate predominantly superficial layers in human V1 (Olman
et al., 2012; Muckli et al., 2015).
Cortical layers differ not only in their projection patterns, but
also with regard to local rhythmic synchronization. Synchroniza-
tion in the gamma frequency band is strongest in superficial
layers, whereas synchronization in the alpha-beta frequency
band is strongest in infragranular layers (Buffalo et al., 2011;
Xing et al., 2012). These results, taken together with the laminar
projection patterns, suggest that gamma might subserve feed-
forward and alpha-beta feedback signaling (Lee et al., 2013;
Fries, 2015). This is supported by patterns of inter-laminar delay
and causality (Livingstone, 1996; Bollimunta et al., 2008; Plomp
et al., 2014). Further, electrical stimulation of V1 induces
enhanced gamma-band activity in V4, whereas area V4 stimula-
tion induces enhanced alpha-beta-band activity in V1 (van Ker-
koerle et al., 2014).
When directed inter-areal influences across 28 area pairs
are assessed through large-scale high-density electrocorticog-
raphy in rhesus macaques and correlated with anatomical pro-
jection patterns, gamma is found systematically stronger in the
feedforward direction and beta in the feedback direction (Bas-
tos et al., 2015). The high consistency of this effect made it
possible to construct a hierarchy of visual areas based on
directed influences alone. These findings raise the intriguing
possibility that a similar analysis in human cortex would reveal
the functional hierarchy of visual areas. In human subjects,
anatomical tract tracing methods, requiring active axonal
transport, are neither possible in the living nor in the post-mor-
tem brain. Further, tractographic analysis of diffusion MRI
does not indicate the directionality of pathways and therefore
cannot explore the hierarchical organization of inter-areal
pathways.
In the present study, we have first selected seven human areas
showing strong homology to macaque areas. This enabled us to
infer the structural hierarchy in the human cortex and to examine
its functional hierarchy using magnetoencephalography (MEG).
This shows that causal interactions along the feedforward and
feedback pathways are exerted in distinct frequency bands.

 Based on these functional markers, we were able to derive the
full hierarchy of 26 human visual areas based on the asymmetry
of their feedforward and feedback interactions.
RESULTS
Visually Induced Responses
Forty-three human subjects were instructed to attentively
monitor a visual stimulus for unpredictable changes, in order
to engage both bottom-up and top-down influences. This
paradigm reliably induces gamma-band activity in visual cor-
tex (Hoogenboom et al., 2006). While subjects fixated cen-
trally, a large circular sine-wave grating contracting toward
the fixation point was presented. The stimulus could change
speed at any time between 0.75 and 3 s after onset, which
had to be reported within 0.5 s in order to obtain positive feed-
back (Figure 1A). Visual stimulation and task performance
induced grand-average power reductions in the alpha and
beta bands and enhancements in the gamma band in many
sensors (Figure 1B), consistent with previous reports (Hoogen-
boom et al., 2006; van Pelt et al., 2012). Gamma power en-
hancements were strongest over occipital and parietal MEG
sensors (Figure 1C). The sensors marked in Figure 1C show
stimulus-induced gamma power enhancements that start
around 0.1 s after stimulus onset and are sustained for the
duration of visual stimulation and task performance (Figure 1D).
Alpha and beta power shows sustained reductions at a slightly
longer latency. Between 0.05 and 0.35 s, there is an additional
theta (3–8 Hz) power enhancement, most likely reflecting the
event-related field (ERF) (Jutai et al., 1984). To avoid the ERF
and the effect of its non-stationarity on Granger causality
(GC) estimation (Wang et al., 2008), further analyses use the
data from 0.365 s after stimulus onset up to the stimulus
change, segmented into non-overlapping 0.365 s epochs
(see Experimental Procedures).
Induced gamma power change estimated at the level of the
cortical sheet revealed an occipital peak extending into parietal
and temporal regions (Figure 2A). In order to investigate GC
among human visual areas and to compare it to macaque
laminar connectivity, we selected seven visual areas, for which
anatomical retrograde tracing data were available, and for which
there is evidence of inter-species homology (see Experimental
Procedures). These areas and their homologies are illustrated
in Figure 2B. Areas V1 and V2 are substantially larger than any
one of the other areas (Figure 2B) and exhibit the largest gamma
power enhancements (Figure 2A). To render V1 and V2 more
comparable in size to the other areas, and to focus on their visu-
ally activated subregions, we used the vertices inside V1 and V2
that were within 2 cm from the local gamma maxima. These
vertices and the vertices of the remaining areas are shown in
Figure 2C.

 GC—Field Spread Effect
MEG sensors pick up mixtures of signals from multiple sources
in the brain. This mixing can be partly deciphered by projecting
MEG data into source space. However, the closer two estimated
sources are, the larger the remaining mixing, an effect referred to
as ‘‘field spread’’ (Schoffelen and Gross, 2009). Field spread
leads to artifactual correlation or coherence for source signals
from proximate locations. Because field spread decays with dis-
tance between sources, the dominant spatial pattern of coher-
ence to a given source (the black parcel in Figure 3) is a smooth
decay with distance from that source (Figures 3A and 3B). By
contrast, the spatial pattern of GC exerted by that source does
not show this smooth decay, but rather, it shows spatial peaks
that have their maximum not at the source or in the immediate
vicinity of the source (Figures 3C and 3D). This is likely due to
the fact that field spread is instantaneous. GC eliminates instan-
taneous correlations because they are not indicative of a causal
influence.

(A–D) For this investigation, each hemisphere was randomly segmented into
400 parcels according to the fast marching algorithm (Sethian, 1999). There
were on average ten vertices per parcel. The parcel closest to the peak of the
average gamma power over all subjects was identified and was selected as the
seed parcel, marked here in black.
(A and B) Coherence was computed for each subject between this seed parcel
and the remaining 399 parcels. These coherence values were subsequently
averaged across all subjects for each pair and each frequency. Finally, for
each pair, the coherence values within the gamma band (40 to 75 Hz) were
averaged.

 GC in Feedforward and Feedback Directions
GC was computed between all possible pairs of the seven
selected visual areas. In order to estimate bias due to the GC
metric used and the finite sample size, data epochs were ran-
domized at each source location and GC computation was
repeated. This bias estimation also entails an estimate of residual
stimulus-locked components remaining after exclusion of the
first 0.365 s after stimulus onset. The two hemispheres were
analyzed independently.
We averaged all inter-areal GC spectra and compared them to
the average bias estimate in order to obtain a first estimate of
overall inter-areal GC, in particular for the main spectral peaks,
(Figure 4A). Average inter-areal GC exceeded the bias estimate
across the spectrum and showed two clear peaks: one in the
alpha-beta range, peaking at 11 Hz, and one in the gamma
band, peaking around 60 Hz. Previous studies have shown clear
differences between alpha and beta rhythms (Wang, 2010;
Bressler and Richter, 2015; Haegens et al., 2014; Gregoriou
et al., 2015); however, the present analysis revealed one peak
spanning across alpha and beta frequency ranges (similar to
Buffalo et al., 2011), which we therefore refer to as the alpha-
beta band. Peak frequencies were essentially identical in the
two hemispheres.
We used macaque laminar connectivity data that quantifies
the degree to which a given inter-areal projection has a feedfor-
ward or feedback character in order to investigate whether GC
differed between the feedforward and feedback directions.
Retrograde tracer injection into a target area leads to labeling
of projection neurons in the source areas. The more pronounced
the feedforward (feedback) character of the anatomical projec-
tion, the higher (lower) is the proportion of supragranular projec-
tion neurons (Barone et al., 2000; Markov et al., 2014). This
anatomical signature of the feedforward or feedback character
of a projection is captured by the supragranular labeled neuron
(SLN) index, i.e., the number of supragranular labeled neurons
divided by the sum of supragranular and infragranular labeled
neurons.
The SLN value for all projections among the seven selected
macaque visual areas was calculated (Markov et al., 2014). If,
between area A and area B, the SLN for the A-to-B projection
was higher than the SLN for the B-to-A projection, then A-to-B
was considered a feedforward and B-to-A a feedback projec-
tion. GC values were averaged independently for both directions
in each area pair (Figures 4B and 4C for the left and right hemi-
spheres, respectively). The same was done with the surrogate
data in order to estimate bias. GC significantly exceeded the
bias estimate across the entire spectrum. GC in the alpha-beta
band was stronger in feedback than in feedforward directions.
In contrast, GC in the gamma band was substantially stronger
in feedforward than in feedback directions. The statistical com-
parison revealed significant differences exclusively in these
two frequency bands. Results are very similar in both hemi-
spheres. The alpha-beta band cluster (p < 0.05) ranged from 7
to 17 Hz in both hemispheres. The gamma-band cluster (p <
0.05) ranged from 42 to 93 Hz in the left hemisphere and from
41 to 84 Hz in the right hemisphere.
Figure 4D shows the GC in feedforward and feedback direc-
tions for all area pairs. GC peaks in the gamma and alpha-beta
bands for all area pairs of both hemispheres. For all area pairs,
GC exceeded the bias estimate for frequencies up to the upper
end of the gamma band. When GC is compared between feed-
forward and feedback directions, most area pairs confirm the
above pattern. The results for the alpha-beta band are as follows:
In the left hemisphere, alpha-beta GC was stronger in the feed-
back than in the feedforward direction in 13 out of 21 area pairs
(61.91%), weaker in 1 area pair (MT-TEO; 4.76%), and not signif-
icantly different in another 7 (33.33%); i.e., it was more frequently
significantly stronger in the feedback than in the feedforward di-
rection (p = 0.0018, sign test here and for the following tests). In
the right hemisphere, alpha-beta GC was stronger in the feed-
back than in the feedforward direction in 13 out of 21 area pairs
(61.91%), weaker in 2 area pairs (MT-TEO and MT-DP; 9.52%),
and not significantly different in another 6 (28.57%) (p =
0.0074). The results for the gamma band are as follows: In the
left hemisphere, gamma GC was stronger in the feedforward
than in the feedback direction in 17 out of 21 area pairs
(80.95%), weaker in 1 area pair (DP-7A; 4.76%), and not signifi-
cantly different in 3 other pairs (14.29%); i.e., it was more
frequently significantly stronger in the feedforward than in the
feedback direction (p = 0.00015). In the right hemisphere,
gamma GC was stronger in the feedforward than in the feedback
direction in 16 out of 21 area pairs (76.19%), weaker in 1 area pair
(DP-7A; 4.76%), and not significantly different in 4 other pairs
(19.05%) (p = 0.00028).
The peak in the GC spectra that we have identified as the
alpha-beta peak spans the classical alpha- and beta-fre-
quency bands. Alpha- and beta-band rhythms vary in fre-
quency across subjects and can be influenced by stimulus
and task conditions (Haegens et al., 2014). We calculated
the average inter-areal GC among the seven visual areas sepa-
rately per subject. When Gaussians were fitted to these aver-
ages in the 4–20 Hz range, most alpha-beta peaks were well
approximated by a single Gaussian and the resulting peak fre-
quencies extended from 7 to 19 Hz (Figures S1A and S1B;
mean ± SD = 11.02 ± 2.45 Hz). Likewise, when Gaussians
were fitted to the GC averages in the 30–100 Hz range, the re-
sulting gamma peak frequencies extended from 52 to 69 Hz
(Figures S1C and S1D; mean ± SD = 59.16 ± 4.16 Hz). Similar
cross-subject
variability
has
been
described
in
previous
studies using the same stimulus and task as used here and
has been related to genetic factors (Hoogenboom et al.,
2006; van Pelt et al., 2012). To account for this inter-subject
variability in peak frequencies, we repeated the above GC an-
alyses after aligning alpha-beta and gamma peak frequencies,
respectively, across subjects (Figure 5). After alignment, GC
values tended to increase, and the above differences between
GC in the feedforward and feedback direction were confirmed.
Significant differences remained identical except in a few
cases, the most notable being V1 and V2 in the right hemi-
sphere, changing from an insignificant difference to a stronger
alpha-beta GC in the feedforward than in the feedback
direction.
Because the peak-aligned analysis accounts for inter-subject
variability, it was used for all further analyses (results without
peak alignment are provided as supplemental information and
are qualitatively identical).

 Correlation between Human Inter-areal GC and
Macaque Anatomical Projections
So far, we have used the SLN metric to decide for each area pair,
which one of the two reciprocal projections is feedforward and
which one is feedback. As explained above, the SLN of an
anatomical projection is the number of supragranular neurons
normalized by the number of supragranular and infragranular
neurons that give rise to the projection. Thus, the SLN quantifies
the feedforward or feedback character of a projection in a
graded metric. We next wanted to correlate this graded anatom-
ical metric with a similarly graded functional metric, which cap-
tures the above-mentioned GC asymmetries. Therefore, we
defined, as in Bastos et al. (2015), the directed influence asym-
metry index (DAI) between areas A and B as
DAIðA � to � BÞ = ðGCðA � to � BÞ � GCðB � to � AÞÞ=
ðGCðA � to � BÞ + GCðB � to � AÞÞ:
The numerator captures the predominant or net direction of GC,
whereas the denominator provides a normalization factor such
that the asymmetry in causal interactions can be compared be-
tween different area pairs and between different frequencies, for
which raw GC values can differ substantially. Note that DAI is
defined per frequency of the GC spectrum.
To test whether the GC asymmetry is systematically related to
the feedforward-feedback character of the anatomical projec-
tions, we calculated the Spearman correlation coefficient be-
tween DAI values (from human MEG data) and SLN values
(from macaque retrograde tracing data) across all visual area
pairs. The seven visual areas under consideration give rise to
42 pairs, of which 38 had anatomical data that reached the
threshold (i.e., more than ten labeled neurons). The DAI-SLN
correlation was determined per GC frequency and per subject.
Figure 6 shows the mean and SEM across the 43 subjects.
The results for the left (Figure 6A) and right (Figure 6B) hemi-
sphere were qualitatively identical. Also, the results remained
qualitatively unchanged when the analysis was repeated without
alignment to the subject-wise alpha-beta- and gamma-band
peak frequencies (Figure S2).
Feedforward (feedback) anatomical projections predomi-
nantly originate in supragranular (infragranular) layers and are
therefore characterized by a large (small) SLN (supragranular
labeled neuron proportion), typically above (below) 0.5. Corre-
spondingly, when the correlation is calculated between SLN
values and DAI values, a positive DAI-SLN correlation for a given
frequency range indicates that this frequency is systematically
stronger (weaker) in the direction of feedforward (feedback) pro-
jections. Thus, the significant positive DAI-SLN correlation for
the gamma band indicates that the net influence in this frequency
is feedforward (left [right] hemisphere: mean = 0.465 [0.467], p =
0.0019 [0.0019]). The significant negative correlation for the
alpha-beta band indicates that the net influence is feedback
(left [right] hemisphere: mean = �0.226 [�0.178], p = 0.0159
[0.0139]).
A GC-Based Hierarchy Correlates with the Anatomical
Hierarchy
SLN values have been used to establish an anatomical hierarchy
of primate visual areas (Markov et al., 2014). In this hierarchy, the
feedforward-feedback character of most inter-areal projections
is in conformity with a global hierarchy, in which each area oc-
cupies a particular hierarchical level. For example, if the A-to-B
projection is feedforward and the B-to-C projection is feedfor-
ward, then the A-to-C projection is typically strongly feedfor-
ward. Note there is no a-priori reason that prevents the A-to-C
projection from being feedback, because neurons in A projecting
to B and C are typically almost completely non-overlapping
(Salin and Bullier, 1995) and neurons are exclusively either feed-
back or feedforward (Markov et al., 2014). The fact that inter-
areal projections tend to confirm to a global hierarchy is an
empirical finding in the large set of available SLN data (Markov
et al., 2014).
Given that the macaque SLN is correlated to the human
DAI, we asked whether the human DAI also establishes a
hierarchy of human visual areas, similar to the DAI-based hierar-
chy of macaque visual areas established previously (Bastos
et al., 2015). Within each subject, we considered each area in
turn as a seed area. The DAI values of this seed area relative to
all areas were ranked (with the DAI of the seed to itself being
zero, according to the DAI definition). Average ranking across
all seven seed areas was established for each subject. Figure 7
shows average rankings and their SEMs across the 43 subjects.

non-parametric statistical test against the null hy-
pothesis of zero correlation, with cluster-based
multiple comparison correction. This analysis was
performed separately for the (A) left and (B) right
hemispheres. In both cases, a frequency cluster of
negative correlation was identified in the alpha-beta
range and a cluster of positive correlation was
identified in the gamma range.

 gamma-frequency band. The human GC-based ranking is
plotted against the macaque anatomy-based ranking (Markov
et al., 2014) and the two hierarchies are significantly correlated
(left hemisphere: R = 0.962, p = 0.0005; right hemisphere: R =
0.945, p = 0.0013; Pearson correlations in this and the following
tests). Note, an essentially perfect correlation existed for all
areas, except TEO, which ranked slightly higher in the human
GC-based than the macaque anatomy-based hierarchy. Note
also that hierarchical levels span almost the entire possible range
of seven levels, suggesting slightly less than seven levels as a
first estimate of a lower bound for the number of hierarchical
levels present in the data (see below for a higher estimate
when more areas are included).
The same procedure was repeated with the DAI in the alpha-
beta frequency band (after inverting its sign because of its nega-
tive correlation to SLN). The resulting relation to anatomy was
less pronounced, because early visual areas V1 and V2 were
placed higher and the ventral-stream areas V4 and TEO were
placed lower than in the anatomical hierarchy (Figure 7B) (left
hemisphere: R = 0.75, p = 0.032; right hemisphere: R = 0.812,
p = 0.0267). A hierarchy based on average DAI values from
both the gamma and the alpha-beta band (after inverting the
latter) shows excellent correspondence between functional
and anatomical hierarchies (Figure 7C) (left hemisphere: R =
0.901, p = 0.0057; right hemisphere: R = 0.923, p = 0.003). In
comparison to the pure gamma-based hierarchy, the ventral-
stream areas V4 and TEO are moved lower. This might be due
to strong feedback influences exerted in the alpha-beta band
(see Discussion).
Functional hierarchies built separately from the GC values in
the two hemispheres were qualitatively identical (compare the
two columns of Figure 7). Further, the results remained quali-
tatively unchanged when the analysis was repeated without
alignment to the subject-wise peak frequencies in the alpha-
beta and gamma band (Figure S3). When the analysis was
repeated for areas randomly defined as contiguous patches
of dipoles (with sizes similar to the actual areas), this produced
correlations distributed around zero. All observed correlations
exceeded the 97.5th percentile of these randomization distri-
butions; i.e., they were significantly different in a two-sided
test.
As an independent test for the presence of functional hierar-
chies, we computed repeated-measures one-way ANOVAs
across subjects with the factor AREA and the dependent variable
HIERARCHICAL LEVEL. The observed F-values were compared
to the distribution of F-values from 1,000 trial shuffles. All hierar-
chies were highly significant (p values of 0–0.003).
GC Establishes a Functional Hierarchy across 26 Human
Visual Areas
The analysis so far was limited to seven areas, for which the ho-
mology between human and macaque is well pronounced and
for which quantitative retrograde tracing data were available.
Given that the anatomical hierarchy was strongly correlated
with a GC-based hierarchy, we next investigated whether a hier-
archy can also be built for a larger set of human visual areas: V1,
V2, V3, V3A, V3B, V3C, V3D, V4, V4t, LO1, LO2, PITd, PITv, MT,
VO1, MST, FST, ER, V7, IPS1, IPS2, IPS3, IPS4, 7A, FEF, 46 (see
Experimental Procedures for description). For these 26 areas,
the functional hierarchical level was derived based on the DAI
metric, in the same fashion as for the 7 areas. Figure 8A shows
the 26 areas according to their functional hierarchical level. If
the hierarchical ranking had not been consistent across seed
areas within subjects, or across subjects, the different areas
would rank roughly at the same hierarchical level. Similarly, if
ranking were not consistent across subjects, the error bars
would be large relative to the rank range. Thus, the fact that in
Figure 8, the 26 areas span almost the entire dynamic range of

Figure 7. GC-Based Hierarchy Correlates with Anatomical Hierarchy
(A–C) The relation between the functional hierarchy of human visual areas and
the anatomical hierarchy of homologous macaque areas was determined
separately for the left and right hemispheres. The functional hierarchy of the
human visual areas was computed from the DAI values (see Experimental
Procedures). Three cases were investigated, namely, with the functional hi-
erarchy computed from (A) DAI in the gamma band, (B) DAI in the alpha-beta
band, and (C) the combined DAI in the alpha-beta and gamma bands. Early
visual areas are depicted in black, ventral-stream areas in green, and dorsal-
stream areas in red. Inset brackets on the bottom right of each subplot report
Pearson correlation between human functional and macaque anatomical hi-
erarchical levels. Notice the push toward lower hierarchical levels of midlevel
ventral-stream areas by the inclusion of feedback causal influences in the
alpha-beta band (compare C to A).

 26 hierarchical levels, with relatively small error bars, suggests
slightly less than 26 levels as a lower bound for the number of hi-
erarchical levels present in the data. It also suggests that the or-
ganization of most area-pair-wise GC influences corresponds to
a global hierarchy. In addition, the resulting hierarchy is in good
agreement with the mosaic of evidence from different sources
including quantitative anatomy (Barone et al., 2000; Markov
et al., 2014), general anatomical connectivity and position (Felle-
man and Van Essen, 1991), and cognitive architectures (De-
haene et al., 2005). The location of the frontal eye field (FEF)
low in the hierarchy is in agreement with recent quantitative anal-

Figure 8. Functional Hierarchy of 26 Human
Visual Areas
(A–C) The functional hierarchy of 26 human visual
areas was computed based on (A) DAI in the
gamma band, (B) DAI in the alpha-beta band, and
(C) the combined DAI in the alpha-beta and
gamma bands. The functional hierarchy in each
case is the average of the functional hierarchies in
the left and right hemispheres. Ventral-stream
areas are depicted in green, dorsal-stream areas
in red, and all other areas in black. In (A) the 26
areas have been ranked along the x axis based on
their average hierarchical level depicted on the y
axis. In (B) and (C), the ranking from (A) has been
preserved on the x axis in order to illustrate
changes in the hierarchy for DAIs of different fre-
quency bands.
ysis of retrograde tracing (Barone et al.,
2000; Markov et al., 2014). In terms of hi-
erarchical discriminability of areas, it is
clear that areas are more separable at
the upper and lower ends of the hierarchy
than they are in the middle of the
hierarchy.
The same procedure repeated in the
alpha-beta band led to several areas
changing their hierarchical level. To illus-
trate this, Figure 8B retains the x axis
ordering established in Figure 8A on the
basis of the gamma-band DAI but reports
on the y axis the hierarchical level based
on the alpha-beta band DAI (a copy of
each area’s gamma-DAI based hierarchi-
cal level is shown as a gray dot). In gen-
eral, ventral-stream areas (labeled green)
V4, PITv, PITd, and VO1 are moved to
lower
levels,
whereas
many
dorsal-
stream
areas
(labeled
red)
including
V3C, V3D, MST, FST, IPS3, IPS4, and
7A are shifted to higher levels. Similarly,
V1 and V2 are moved to higher levels.
These shifts could be due to relatively
strong alpha-beta-band influences ex-
erted by the dorsal-stream areas onto
the ventral-stream areas and exempting
the earliest areas V1 and V2 (see Discus-
sion). Likewise, FEF is shifted to a higher level, suggesting that it
exerts relatively strong alpha-beta feedback.
The split between dorsal- and ventral-stream areas becomes
even more apparent when the functional hierarchy is based on
the DAIs from the gamma and alpha-beta bands combined (Fig-
ure 8C). Compared to a pure gamma-based hierarchy (gray dots),
it shows a consistent upward shift for most dorsal-stream areas
(V3C, V3D, MST, FST, V7, and IPS1–4) and a consistent down-
ward shift for ventral-stream areas (V4, PITv, PITd, and VO1).
We repeated the ANOVA analysis for the 26 areas, and again
all hierarchies were significant (p values ranging from 0 to 0.016).

 DISCUSSION
We used MEG to study the spectral specificity of causal influ-
ences along inferred anatomical feedforward and feedback pro-
jections in the human visual cortex. Projections were defined as
feedforward or feedback based on retrograde tracing data in ho-
mologous macaque visual areas. Frequency-resolved Granger
causality between human visual cortical areas showed that
causal influences along feedforward projections were predomi-
nant in the gamma band, whereas causal interactions along
feedback projections were predominant in the alpha-beta
band. Based on these results, we used all inter-areal GC values
to build a functional hierarchy in human visual cortex, which was
strongly correlated to the hierarchy derived from macaque retro-
grade tracing data. Finally, we extrapolated this to 26 human vi-
sual areas.
The present analyses are based on MEG data from 43 human
subjects, which allowed us to use statistics that are non-para-
metric counterparts of random-effect statistics. The previous
analysis using the electrocorticogram (ECoG) in macaques was
restricted to two animals, as is typical for non-human primate
studies, and thereby to a fixed-effect analysis. Whereas a
fixed-effect analysis allows inference only on the tested sample,
our present analysis allows generalization to the population of
human subjects.
Fast Versus Slow Oscillations for Feedforward and
Feedback Signaling
Several studies have reported that feedforward and feedback
communication use respectively higher and lower frequency
ranges. Some studies compared task conditions and found
that conditions expected to emphasize feedforward signaling
lead to stronger synchronization in relatively higher frequency
bands, whereas conditions expected to emphasize feedback
signaling lead to stronger synchronization in relatively lower fre-
quency bands (von Stein et al., 2000; Buschman and Miller,
2007; Arnal et al., 2011). Other studies compared anatomical
structures and found that pathways or layers involved in feed-
forward signaling show stronger synchronization at higher
frequencies, and pathways or layers involved in feedback
signaling show stronger synchronization in lower frequencies.
For example, feedforward communication from medial entorhi-
nal cortex to hippocampal area CA1 uses higher gamma,
whereas feedback communication from CA3 to CA1 uses lower
gamma (Colgin et al., 2009; Schomburg et al., 2014). In visual
cortex, superficial layers, sending feedforward projections,
show predominantly gamma-band synchronization, whereas in-
fragranular layers, sending feedback projections, show predom-
inantly alpha-beta-band synchronization (Buffalo et al., 2011;
Xing et al., 2012). Across cortical sublayers, gamma shows
phase shifts consistent with feedforward signaling (Livingstone,
1996; van Kerkoerle et al., 2014) and alpha shows phase shifts
or GC consistent with feedback signaling (Bollimunta et al.,
2011; van Kerkoerle et al., 2014). Direct quantification of directed
influences by means of GC showed that inter-areal feedforward
influences are carried by gamma and feedback influences by
alpha or beta rhythms. Between human auditory area A1 and
auditory association cortex, feedforward signaling uses gamma,
and feedback signaling delta/beta rhythms (Fontolan et al.,
2014). Between macaque visual areas V1 and V4, feedforward
signaling uses gamma and feedback signaling alpha or beta
(Bosman et al., 2012; van Kerkoerle et al., 2014).
Finally, a recent study investigated eight visual areas in ma-
caque and found that across the numerous inter-areal projec-
tions, feedforward connectivity was systematically related to
GC in the theta and gamma bands, and feedback connectivity
was systematically related to GC in the beta band (Bastos
et al., 2015). These earlier results from macaques agree fully
with the present results for humans in the gamma band, but
they agree only partly in the other frequency bands. Our present
analysis in humans suggests that top-down influences are ex-
erted by rhythms spanning alpha and beta frequency ranges,
even though previous studies clearly suggest separate alpha
and beta rhythms (Wang, 2010; Womelsdorf et al., 2014; Gregor-
iou et al., 2015). It is important to note that our analysis merely
reveals whether directed influences in a frequency band relate
to feedforward or feedback projections. Our results suggest
that both alpha and beta subserve top-down signaling. Yet,
this does not contradict differential mechanisms and sub-func-
tions of top-down influences (Fries, 2015). Alpha might mediate
top-down influences suppressing irrelevant background (van
Kerkoerle et al., 2014), whereas beta might mediate top-down in-
fluences, that facilitate the bottom-up communication of at-
tended stimuli (Lee et al., 2013; Bastos et al., 2015). Our present
analysis did not reveal a convincing peak of GC influences in the
theta frequency range, even though theta-band influences have
been found in the earlier study with macaques (Bastos et al.,
2015). The reason for this difference is currently unclear, and
we can only speculate that it might be due to differences be-
tween ECoG and MEG or between the stimulus and/or task
conditions.
Compared to infragranular connectivity, supragranular con-
nectivity shows fine-grained spatial structure and interconnects
some brain regions, such as, e.g., frontal cortex and ventral vi-
sual areas (Markov et al., 2014), possibly allowing frontal areas
to change their functional hierarchical level dynamically (Bastos
et al., 2015). In agreement with this, gamma-band GC influences
between macaque FEF and V4 predominate in the FEF-to-V4 di-
rection after an attentional cue, but subsequently predominate in
the V4-to-FEF direction (Gregoriou et al., 2009). Between human
frontal cortex and high-level ventral visual cortex, gamma-band
coherence shows a 20 ms phase lead of frontal cortex (Baldauf
and Desimone, 2014).
The present results, indicating a functional hierarchy of the
human visual cortex, are relevant to future investigation of pre-
dictive coding in human cortex. Feedforward and feedback influ-
ences have been hypothesized to subserve the signaling of
prediction errors and predictions, respectively. These concepts
are central to the theory of predictive coding, stating in essence
that higher areas constantly derive predictions based on
incoming evidence and prior experience, and feed those predic-
tions back to lower areas, where they are subtracted from sen-
sory evidence, such that only prediction errors need to be
forwarded to higher areas (Bastos et al., 2012). Crucially, in
this framework, the updating of predictions entails the accumu-
lation of prediction errors over time, so that predictions change
Neuron 89, 384–397, January 20, 2016 ª2016 Elsevier Inc.
393
 more slowly than prediction errors. Therefore, if predictions and
prediction errors are mediated through inter-areal rhythmic syn-
chronization, the communication of prediction errors requires
higher frequencies than the communication of predictions. This
is in agreement with several recent studies (Fontolan et al.,
2014; van Kerkoerle et al., 2014; Bastos et al., 2015) and our
finding that feedforward signaling is dominated by gamma and
feedback signaling is dominated by alpha-beta rhythms.
Ventral-Stream Areas
Although the functional human hierarchy derived from the DAI
was largely in agreement with the macaque anatomical hierar-
chy, some important deviations were observed, especially
when the hierarchy was computed from the feedback causal
asymmetries in the alpha-beta band. In this case, the ventral-
stream areas V4 and TEO were much lower in the functional hi-
erarchy than in the anatomical one. Feedback causal influences
were strongest onto area V4 and progressively decreased to-
ward the primary visual cortex. A similarly decreasing pattern
has been observed for the effect of attention on firing rates in
areas V1, V2, and V4 (Buffalo et al., 2010). In this work, a reverse
order of attentional effects was shown, with a stronger and
earlier enhancement in firing rates in V4 and progressively
smaller and later enhancement in V2 and in V1. This strong feed-
back influence on V4 was also prominent in the hierarchy derived
from the combined feedforward and feedback causal asymme-
tries as manifested in the unexpectedly low hierarchical position
of V4 (at a similar level to V2).
These results suggest that feedback influences from higher
ventral and dorsal areas primarily address mid-level ventral-
stream areas such as V4 and TEO and to a lesser degree affect
the earlier visual areas V2 and V1. It has already been suggested
that early ventral-stream areas, and especially area V4, are
well positioned for integrating top-down influences with bot-
tom-up information (Roe et al., 2012), mainly due to strong
corticocortical (Cloutman, 2013; Markov et al., 2014) and corti-
cothalamocortical (Van Essen, 2005) anatomical connections
with temporal, prefrontal, and parietal regions.
Also, details of the task may differentially impact the patterns
of alpha-beta band top-down influences. Our task required sub-
jects to detect a speed change in a drifting grating and may
therefore predominantly engage the dorsal stream. It is conceiv-
able that this contributed to strong alpha-beta band influences
from dorsal- to ventral-stream areas, which in turn places dor-
sal-stream areas higher and ventral-stream areas lower in the
functional hierarchy. Future studies might systematically investi-
gate changes in the functional hierarchy as a function of task
requirements.
Functional Hierarchy of 26 Visual Areas
Using the asymmetry in causal interactions, we estimated the
functional hierarchy for 26 areas of the human visual system.
For several of the 26 areas, it is not possible to establish a clear
homology to areas in the non-human primate brain. Yet, for the
areas for which a homology can be hypothesized, there was a
good agreement between functional and anatomical hierarchical
level (Felleman and Van Essen, 1991; Markov et al., 2014).
Furthermore, for areas defined only in humans, the functional hi-
erarchical level agreed with expectations derived from the over-
all position in the brain and functional characteristics. The strong
effect of feedback causal influences on mid-level ventral-stream
areas was observed also in this hierarchy.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Experimental Paradigm
The experimental paradigm (Figure 1A) was adopted from (van Pelt et al., 2012)
and (Hoogenboom et al., 2006) and is known to induce strong gamma band
oscillations in occipital areas. Each trial was initiated with a fixation point
(Gaussian of diameter 0.5 deg.) at the center of the screen for 1.5 s. The fixation
period was followed by the presentation of a circular sine-wave grating,
centered at the fixation point and contracting toward its center (spatial fre-
quency: 3 cycles/deg, velocity: 0.66 deg/s, contrast: 100%). The screen back-
ground was black. At a random moment between 0.75 and 3 s after stimulus
onset, the velocity increased (step to 1 deg/s), which was reported by the sub-
jects with their right index finger. After the response followed a rest period of
1 s, during which feedback was given. A total of 180 trials were presented to
each subject. Visual presentation was performed on a translucent screen, sit-
uated 0.9 m in front of subjects’ eyes by using an LCD projector with a 60-Hz
update rate. We quantified the MEG signal components locked to the LCD up-
date for sensors over the visual cortex (Figure 1C), and we found them to ac-
count for a very small part of the total power at 60 Hz (< 1.94% of 60 Hz power
during baseline, < 1.42% of 60 Hz power during stimulation). Note that data
were acquired in Europe; i.e., the power line frequency was 50 Hz.
Data Acquisition
MEG: Recordings were performed with a whole-head MEG system (CTF
Systems) comprising 275 axial gradiometers. MRI: Structural MR images
were acquired using an Avanto 1.5 T whole-body MRI scanner (Siemens,
Germany). Further details can be found in the corresponding section of Sup-
plemental Experimental Procedures.
Subjects
Datasets of 43 subjects were selected from a pool of 160 subjects, which had
been recorded for genotyping of parameters derived from visually induced
gamma-band activity. Further details on selection criteria can be found in
the corresponding section of Supplemental Experimental Procedures. All sub-
jects gave written informed consent according to guidelines of the local ethics
committee (Commissie Mensgebonden Onderzoek Regio Arnhem-Nijmegen,
the Netherlands).
Data Preprocessing and Spectral Estimation
All MEG data analysis was performed in MATLAB, partly using the FieldTrip
toolbox (Oostenveld et al., 2011). Data segments that contained artifacts orig-
inating from jumps in the SQUIDs (super-conducting quantum interference
devices), muscle activity and eye movements were identified and removed us-
ing semi-automated FieldTrip routines. Power-line artifacts were estimated
and removed using a discrete Fourier transform at 50, 100 and 150 Hz with a
bin width of ± 0.25 Hz. We used data from 0.365 s after stimulus onset until
the visual stimulus changed speed, thereby excluding stimulus-onset or
stimulus–change-related non-stationarities. These data were divided into
non-overlapping 0.365-s epochs. This fixed epoch length provided a good
compromise between optimizing the use of the variable-length trials and maxi-
mizing the spectral resolution for the non-parametric spectral factorization
employed in the calculation of GC. Epochs taken from early or late in the trial
(median split) did not differ in their GC and were therefore pooled. Spectral esti-
mation was first performed at the sensor level. Per sensor, each data epoch
was demeaned, Hann-tapered, zero-padded to 1 s length, and Fourier trans-
formed to give a spectrum between 1 and 140 Hz (Percival and Walden, 2000).
Human Brain Model
For source analysis, structural MR images were acquired for each individual
subject and the cortical mantle was extracted with the FreeSurfer longitudi-
nal-stream pipeline (Reuter et al., 2012). Cortical parcellation and area

 definition used a recent visuotopic atlas provided by (Abdollahi et al., 2014),
the FreeSurfer software suite (http://FreeSurfer.net/) (Fischl et al., 2004; Desi-
kan et al., 2006; Destrieux et al., 2010), and the Caret software suite (http://
brainvis.wustl.edu/) (Glasser and Van Essen, 2011; Van Essen et al., 2012).
Further details on the construction of the source space with the investigated
visual areas can be found in the corresponding section of Supplemental Exper-
imental Procedures.
Selection of Homologous Brain Areas between Human and Macaque
We aimed at relating functional connectivity derived from human MEG record-
ings to anatomical connectivity derived from macaque retrograde tracing ex-
periments. Therefore, the availability of retrograde tract tracing data dictated
the selection of visual areas. From the set of areas in the occipital, parietal,
and temporal cortical regions with such tracing data, a subset was selected
for which evidence of homology between human and macaque brains exists
in the literature. These areas were V1, V2, MT, V4, DP, TEO, and 7A and are
shown in Figure 2B. The numbers of dipoles per area are listed in Table S1.
More details about the selected areas and their homology between species
can be found in the corresponding section of Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
Parcels representing areas V1 and V2 are quite extensive in comparison to
the other parcels and contain a large number of voxels that are far from the
main locus of activation, as defined by visually induced gamma power
enhancement (Figure 2). In order to minimize the effect of the resulting exten-
sive smoothing, a more spatially confined representation for these areas has
been employed. In this representation, V1 and V2 parcels consist of the
vertices within 2 cm from the local gamma power maxima within the original
representation of these areas.
Inverse Solution
Subject-wise structural MRI scans were used to derive individual single-shell
volume conductor models (Nolte, 2003). The inverse solution was then per-
formed using linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) adaptive spatial
filtering, often referred to as ‘‘beamforming.’’ When determining the LCMV so-
lution, we used a regularization parameter of 20% of the covariance matrix.
For further details on the inverse solution, please see the corresponding sec-
tion in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
GC
In order to study the strength and directionality of causal influences between
the investigated brain areas, we employed GC (Granger, 1969), a statistical
measure that quantifies the extent to which one time series can predict
another. The principal idea behind GC is that if the addition of the history of
signal A improves the prediction of signal B, as compared to the prediction
of signal B based on its own history alone, then signal A is said to ‘‘Granger-
cause’’ signal B.
This measure of predictive causality can be estimated either in the time
domain or in the frequency domain (Geweke, 1982). In the latter case, GC
provides a spectrum of causal interactions between the two signals as a
function of frequency. This is of great utility for the analysis of MEG data
because oscillations at distinct frequencies can be simultaneously realized
in different brain areas and likely subserve inter-areal communication (Fries,
2005, 2015). GC can be calculated using parametric methods based on
multivariate autoregressive models. This approach requires the selection of
model parameters and can fail to capture complex spectral features (Mitra
and Pesaran, 1999). Therefore, we used a non-parametric approach, which
estimates GC directly from a factorization of the cross-spectral density
(CSD) matrix (Dhamala et al., 2008). For the present study, the CSD of two
brain sources is simply the scalar product between their complex and com-
plex-conjugate
spectral
coefficient
sequences.
These
coefficients
are
computed by multiplying the sensor-level spectral decomposition with the
spatial filter for each location.
The visuotopic source space used in this work consists of the set of points
distributed within the brain areas of interest, referred to as ‘‘parcels.’’ To calcu-
late the GC between two parcels, we first averaged the CSD between all inter-
parcel dipole pairs. Within parcels, the power spectral density was computed
by averaging all the within-parcel power-spectral density values.
Retrograde Tracing Database
A description of the anatomical dataset acquisition and analysis has been re-
ported in Markov et al. (2014). Please see also the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures for additional information.
Selection of 26 Visual Areas from the Human Brain
For this analysis, we extended the initial set of 7 visual areas, for which
anatomical connectivity information was available, to an extended set of 26
areas involved in visual processing. The additional areas were V3, V3A, V3B,
V3C, V3D, V4t, LO1, LO2, VO1, MST, and FST from the atlas of Abdollahi
et al. (2014) and areas IPS1, IPS2, IPS3, IPS4, 46, ER from the visuotopic atlas
of Caret (Van Essen et al., 2012). Area PIT from the 7-area analysis was split
into its two constituent areas PITv, PITd from the atlas of Abdollahi et al.
(2014). FEFs were manually selected. For further details on the 26 selected vi-
sual areas, see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Statistical Testing
Figures 4 and 5 use randomization-based non-parametric statistical tests with
cluster-based multiple comparison correction (Maris and Oostenveld, 2007).
Each subject provided one feedforward and one feedback GC spectrum,
which were compared across subjects via t tests. The t-values of spectrally
adjacent, significant t tests were summed to generate the observed (first-level,
cluster-based) test metric (not used for inference). We then performed 1000
randomizations. In each randomization, feedforward and feedback labels
were randomly exchanged per subject, and the test metric was computed
as for the non-randomized data. Per randomization, the largest test metric
was entered into the randomization distribution. The observed test metrics
were compared against the randomization distribution. Comparisons between
feedforward or feedback GC versus the bias estimates proceeded accord-
ingly. Similarly, the correlation coefficients between DAI and SLN values
(computed as explained in the Results section) were tested against zero (Fig-
ure 6) and against bias estimates (Figure S2); i.e., each subject provided one
correlation spectrum and either one null spectrum or one bias-estimate
spectrum.
