T
hroughout history, across cultures and time, 
the buttocks have endured as a key body ele-
ment of female beauty.1 Ancient paintings, 
sculptures, and other fine art forms are replete 
with symbolic representations of the aesthetic 
ideal female figure.2 In our modern age, new fash-
ion trends, Internet accessibility, strong media 
influence, and an increased focus on body image 
have fueled an increasingly greater interest in 
achieving transcendent feminine ideals.3,4 These 
modern trends have led to a dramatic increase in 
the number of patients seeking surgical means to 
perfect their figures, with a noticeable emphasis 
on buttocks enhancement.5
A waist-to-hip ratio of 0.7 has been suggested 
as the aesthetic ideal but was based primarily on 
studies of Miss America pageant winners, Playboy

Background: The buttocks are a key element of female beauty, with aesthetic 
gluteoplasty becoming one of the fastest growing plastic surgery procedures. 
However, there remains no clear standard for the ideal buttocks. The authors 
performed a population analysis of the characteristics of the ideal buttocks to 
guide surgical planning.
Methods: Images of buttocks were digitally altered to create buttocks of vary-
ing proportions on posterior and lateral views. Waist-to-hip ratios and varying 
vertical proportions were studied. Data were stratified and analyzed according 
to age range, gender, ethnicity, and nationality of the respondents.
Results: A total of 1146 responses were collected. Of 989 respondents who sub-
mitted their gluteal preferences, 482 respondents (48.7 percent) were women 
and 507 (51.3 percent) were men. Overall, the most attractive buttocks waist-
to-hip ratio is 0.65 from the posterior view (44.2 percent of respondents). The 
next most attractive ratio was 0.60 (25 percent of respondents). Positioning of 
the lateral prominence at the inferior gluteal fold was rated by 26.3 percent 
of respondents as the most attractive. From the lateral view, the most attractive 
buttocks have a waist-to-hip ratio of 0.70 (29.8 percent of respondents), with the 
most prominent portion positioned at the midpoint of the buttocks (45.1 per-
cent of respondents), which is a 50:50 vertical ratio. There were no significant 
differences in preferences between respondent ages, genders, or ethnicities.
Conclusions: New ideal waist-to-hip ratios of 0.6 and 0.65 update the previous 
standards and indicate a more dramatic and “curvier” new ideal, signaling 
an important preference paradigm shift. The information derived from this 
study has the potential to guide gluteoplasty practices and techniques. (Plast.

Playmates, and line drawings of female figures.6 
The waist-to-hip ratio of 0.7 was further rejected by 
another study, stating that the studied female pop-
ulation had greater variation in waist-to-hip ratio, 
and that the average ratio was in actuality 0.67.7 
Although the female icons studied represent an 
ideal of beauty, they are a unique standard and 
do not represent the body type or the aesthetic 
ideals of the general female population. For these 
reasons, we aimed to identify and update the cur-
rent waist-to-hip ratio ideal using mathematically 
balanced images representing a broader, more 
realistic range of shapes and ratios.
Surgical improvement of the buttocks, or glu-
teoplasty, is now one of the fastest growing proce-
dures in the field of plastic surgery. According to 
statistical data collected by the American Society of 
Plastic Surgeons, the number of buttock augmen-
tations with fat grafting increased by 15 percent 
in just 1 year (from 2013 to 2014), whereas the 
number of buttock augmentations with implants 
increased 98 percent during this same interval.5
Despite these dramatic trends, there remains 
no clear ideal to guide aesthetic gluteoplasty tech-
niques. Various characteristics of attractive buttocks 
are often described but remain poorly validated. To 
date, no efforts have been made to objectively ascer-
tain and validate the most attractive aesthetic ideal 
for the buttocks. We propose a solution to this prob-
lem with a population analysis of the ideal buttocks, 
based on digitally altered images. Key proportions 
were modified and the ideal buttock characteristics 
identified. We hypothesize that the growing media 
frenzy for more voluptuous buttocks has impacted 
the current perception of the ideal buttocks, mak-
ing any previous standards outdated.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
This study was performed with approval of our 
institutional review board (no. 5150162). A study 
questionnaire was developed using digitally altered 
images of buttocks and distributed electronically 
with the use of social media platforms. Those sur-
veyed were also asked to anonymously provide 
demographic details of their age, gender, ethnicity, 
and nationality for data analysis. Population ages 
were divided into the following ranges: 18 to 24 
years, 25 to 34 years, 35 to 49 years, 50 to 64 years, 
and 65 years and older. These age ranges are based 
on standard demographic delineated categories.
Royalty-free images of buttocks were purchased 
from an online stock photography provider (iStock; 
Calgary, Alberta, Canada; and Getty Images, Chi-
cago, Ill.). The necessary licenses to alter, reproduce, 
and publish the images were also purchased. These 
images were digitally altered with Adobe Photoshop 
CC (Adobe Systems, Inc., San Jose, Calif.) to create 
buttocks of varying proportions on posterior and lat-
eral views. The proportions were measured with the 
Adobe Photoshop CC ruler tool for confirmation of 
accuracy. For consistency, the waist-to-hip ratio used 
in this study was defined as the width of the waist 
(defined as the narrowest portion between the ribs 
and the iliac crest) compared to the width of the 
widest point of the buttocks (from the iliac crest to 
the infragluteal crease). The iliac crest was chosen 
as the superior border of the buttocks because it is a 
visible (and palpable) skeletal foundation with mini-
mal tendency to change with age and weight.8 Four 
panels of buttock images of varying proportions 
were created:
1. Posterior view with varying waist-to-hip 
ratios (Fig. 1).
2. Posterior view with varying vertical propor-
tions (Fig. 2). [See Figure, Supplemental 
Digital Content 1, which shows vertical pro-
portions. The dimensions used to calculate 
the varying vertical proportions are demon-
strated (above), using the 60:40 ratio as an 
example. Posterior views with varying verti-
cal proportions in a randomized pattern are 
shown as panel 2 for the respondents’ ratings 
(below). The proportions are shown for the

proportions selected were percentage ratios of 
70:30, 60:40, 50:50, 40:60, and 30:70. For exam-
ple, a ratio of 70:30 indicated positioning of the 
most prominent point at a horizontal line divid-
ing the buttock height into an upper 70 percent 
and lower 30 percent portion. Buttocks with the 
lateral prominence positioned at the inferior 
gluteal fold were defined as having an inferior 
gluteal convexity, or natural (see Figure, Supple-

Within each panel, the images were arranged

panel, respondents were instructed to select the 
image that they found most attractive. Data were 
stratified according to the age range, gender,

Statistical analysis of the data was performed with 
Microsoft Excel 2013 (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, 
Wash.), with values of p < 0.05 designating statisti-
cal significance of results.
RESULTS
A total of 1146 responses were collected, 
 
482 (48.7 percent) of which were from female 
respondents and 507 (51.3 percent) of which were 
from male respondents (Table 1). Of the total 
1146 total responses, 116 people (13.6 percent) 
 
submitted their gluteal aesthetic preferences but 
did not complete the demographic portion of the 
questionnaire. The responses of these individuals 
were included for the total buttock preferences 
analysis but not used in the demographic analysis 
of the data.
Buttock Preferences of the Overall General 
Population
From an overall general population perspec-
tive, the most attractive waist-to-hip ratio is 0.65 
from the posterior view (44.2 percent of respon-
dents) (Table 2). The next most attractive ratio 
was 0.60 (25 percent of respondents). Buttocks 
with an inferior gluteal convexity (with the lat-
eral prominence positioned at the inferior gluteal 
fold) were rated by 26.3 percent of respondents 
as the most attractive, whereas 23.6 percent of 
respondents preferred the placement of the lat-
eral prominence at the lower 70 percent of the 
buttocks (70:30 vertical ratio). From the lateral

view, the most attractive buttocks have a waist-to-
hip ratio of 0.70, with the most prominent pos-
terior portion positioned at the midpoint of the 
buttocks (50:50 vertical ratio).
Buttock Preferences Categorized by Age Ranges 
of Respondents
When the buttock preferences were catego-
rized by respondent age ranges, there were no 
significant differences (Table 3). A majority of 
respondents of each age range category preferred 
a waist-to-hip ratio of 0.65 from the posterior view 
(34.9 percent to 47.1 percent). In the 65 years or 
older category, 26.7 percent of respondents pre-
ferred a waist-to-hip ratio of both 0.65 and 0.75. 
Also from a posterior view, the most common 
preference from respondents of all age categories 
was either an inferior gluteal convexity or a ver-
tical ratio placed at the lower 70 percent of the 
buttocks.
On the lateral view, the most preferred waist-
to-hip ratio was 0.70 for respondents aged 18 to 49 
years. As the age ranges increased, the most pre-
ferred waist-to-hip ratio also increased. Respon-
dents aged 50 to 64 years preferred a waist-to-hip 
ratio of 0.725, and those aged 65 years or older 
preferred 0.75. The most preferred vertical ratio 
for the most prominent portion was at the mid-
point of the buttocks (50:50 ratio) for all of the 
respondent age ranges with the exception of 
those aged 35 to 49 years, who preferred the 40:60 
vertical ratio.
Buttock Preferences Categorized by Gender and 
Age Ranges of Respondents
Waist-to-Hip Ratio on Posterior View
When analyzing waist-to-hip ratio preferences 
from a posterior view, similarities between the 
various age ranges and genders of respondents 
were observed (Fig. 5). A majority of respondents 
preferred a waist-to-hip ratio of 0.65. The next 
most preferred waist-to-hip ratio was 0.60. Waist-
to-hip ratio preferences were similar between gen-
ders within the same age ranges. The numbers of 
respondents who were aged 65 years or older were 
few (eight men and seven women) in comparison 
with those of other age ranges studied, making it 
challenging to extract any conclusions regarding 
buttock preferences from this age group.
Vertical Ratios of Lateral Prominences on 
Posterior View
When analyzing vertical ratio preferences from 
a posterior view, there was a broad distribution of 
preferences among the various age ranges and 
genders. For the respondents aged 18 to 49 years, 
 
both male and female respondents preferred that 
the lateral prominence was positioned no higher 
than at the mid vertical height of the buttocks. 
Positioning of the lateral prominence at this mid-
point or at a position lower was preferred in a 
majority of respondents (86.9 to 90.4 percent). 
There were no differences between the prefer-
ences of male and female respondents in these 
age groups, with the exception that significantly

more men preferred a more natural and lower lat-
eral prominence than women aged 25 to 34 years.
Vertical Ratios of Posterior Prominences on 
Lateral View
Analysis of the vertical ratios of the posterior 
buttock prominence showed similarities across the 
varying age groups and genders. When evaluat-
ing the lateral view of buttocks, a majority of both 
male and female respondents of all age ranges 
preferred a position of the most prominent point 
to be at the mid height of the buttocks (41.7 per-
cent of men and 48.3 percent of women) or at the 
upper 40 percent of the vertical height (39.0 per-
cent of men and 36.5 percent of women). Prefer-
ences between male and female respondents were 
similar.
Waist-to-Hip Ratio on Lateral View
Analysis of waist-to-hip ratios from a lateral 
view of the buttocks showed similarities in the dis-
tribution of preferences among the different age 
groups and genders. Most respondents preferred 
a lateral waist-to-hip ratio of 0.70 or 0.75. Overall, 
there was no difference between the preferences 
of the genders within each age group, with the 
exceptions of more female respondents in the 35- 
to 49-year age range, who preferred a smaller ratio 
of 0.675, and more male respondents in the same 
age range, who preferred a larger ratio of 0.75, 
both of which are statistically significant.
Buttock Preferences by Ethnicity
When evaluating waist-to-hip ratio from a 
posterior buttock view, respondents of all eth-
nicities were unanimous in preferring a ratio of 
0.65. Respondents of white/Caucasian, Middle 
Eastern, and Hispanic/Latino ethnicities rated 
waist-to-hip ratios of 0.60 as a secondary prefer-
ence. With regard to vertical ratios of the lateral 
buttock prominence on the posterior view, eth-
nicities that preferred natural-appearing buttocks 
were white/Caucasian, black/African, and Native 
American. Ethnicities that preferred placement 
of the prominence at the lower 70 percent of the 
buttocks were Pacific Islander, Chinese, Japanese, 
and other Southeast Asian.
Preferences of the lateral view of the buttocks 
varied between ethnicities. A majority of ethnici-
ties preferred a lateral waist-to-hip ratio of 0.70 to 
0.725, with the exception of Pacific Islander, Chi-
nese, and Japanese respondents, who preferred a 
ratio of 0.75. The posterior prominence at the mid 
buttocks (50:50 vertical ratio) was most desirable 
in the eyes of white/Caucasian, Pacific Islander, 
Native American, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, 
Cambodian, other Southeast Asian, and Indian 
subcontinent respondents. Respondents that pre-
ferred a higher point of posterior prominence 
(40:60 vertical ratio) were those of black/African, 
Middle Eastern, and Hispanic/Latino descent.
Buttock Preferences by Respondent Location
An overwhelming majority of respondents 
resided in the United States (93.5 percent). Thus, 
buttock preferences were not evaluated according 
to the respondents’ location of origin.
DISCUSSION
This study aimed to define the general popu-
lation’s preference for ideal buttocks. There has 
been a dramatically increased interest in buttock 
aesthetics but no clear ideal to guide gluteoplasty 
surgical planning. Various characteristics of attrac-
tive buttocks were often described but remain 
poorly validated. Roberts et al. described four fea-
tures that are common to attractive and youthful 
buttocks across all ethnic groups: (1) a smooth 
inward sweep of the lumbosacral area and waist, 
(2) a feminine cleavage as the buttocks separate, 
(3) maximum prominence in the mid to upper 
buttocks, and (4) a minimal infragluteal crease.3,4 
The authors later described various ethnic con-
siderations in gluteal augmentation, based on 
their observations with patients.9 However, their 
observations were subjective and not objectively 
validated in subsequent studies. Cuenca-Guerra 
and Lugo-Beltran10 and Cuenca-Guerra and 
Quezada11 performed an analysis of photographs 
of 2400 nude women between the ages of 20 to 35 
years in various postures, describing four defin-
ing characteristics of the buttocks that are con-
sidered beautiful: (1) a lateral depression, (2) an 
infragluteal fold, (3) supragluteal fossettes, and 
(4) a V-shaped crease. The posterior projection 
of the buttocks was described as the feature most 
responsible for the attractiveness of the buttocks. 
Unfortunately, it is not specified whether the 
women in these photographs were of a standard 
female body type or models. Although the char-
acteristics defined are undoubtedly critical for 
buttock aesthetics, they only represented the per-
spective of six surgeons. Constantino Mendieta 
described a classification system based on three 
landmarks (i.e., upper lateral hip area, mid-but-
tock area, and lateral leg area), where a patient’s 
frame is categorized as square, round, A-shaped, 
or V-shaped.12 This system has been used in con-
junction with his ptosis classification scheme and

is only part of the very complex regional buttock 
anatomy.
Our study found that a lower waist-to-hip ratio 
was preferred in comparison with the often-cited 
0.7. A majority of respondents (44.2 percent) 
chose 0.65 as the most attractive waist-to-hip ratio 
on the posterior view, whereas 25.0 percent chose 
0.60. It is noteworthy that the golden ratio falls 
within this range. Only 5.7 percent of respondents 
thought 0.70 was the most attractive waist-to-hip 
ratio. This may be the consequence of promi-
nent exposure and desensitization of the general 
population to reality stars and celebrities with cur-
vier figures. However, on the lateral view, a large 
number of respondents (29.8 percent) found that 
a waist-to-hip ratio of 0.7 was the most attractive, 
whereas 22.4 percent and 20.3 percent selected a 
waist-to-hip ratio of 0.725 and 0.75 as most attrac-
tive, respectively. In uniting these two preferences, 
respondents prefer a more dramatic appearance 
on the posterior view with a smaller waist and 
larger and more voluptuous buttocks. However, 
on the lateral view, a less enhanced shape is pre-
ferred. This suggests that plastic surgeons should 
tailor their fat grafting techniques to enhance the 
periphery and lateral aspects of the buttocks to 
aim for a waist-to-hip ratio of 0.60 on the posterior 
view while not enhancing the central area out of 
proportion to the rest to stay within the 0.70 waist-
to-hip ratio on the lateral view.
Interestingly, there were no consistent or obvi-
ous differences in the preferences of respondents 
by their gender or ethnicity. Previous authors 
have stated that Caucasians and Asians desire 
more athletic buttocks, whereas Africans and 
Hispanics prefer a curvier aesthetic.9 However, 
we did not observe such findings in this study, as 
waist-to-hip ratios of 0.60 and 0.65 were preferred 
among all ethnic groups. However, this was an 
American-centric study and such findings were 
limited by the highly disproportionate number of 
Caucasians in comparison with other ethnicities. 
We anticipate more culture-specific findings in 
future studies with a more proportionate number 
of respondents from other ethnic groups and geo-
graphic locations.
This study had morphometric limitations as 
well. The varying characteristics of the buttocks 
were simplistic in that they did not take into 
account the variables that compose the frame of 
the buttocks (i.e., bony pelvis, fat, and skin). We 
were limited in not being able to simulate vary-
ing degrees of attractive superficial anatomical 
landmarks such as the sacral triangle and sacral 
dimples. However, given the general population’s 
preference for larger, more voluptuous buttocks, 
these landmarks would likely be effaced in this 
type of buttocks. One of the principles of gluteo-
plasty is that surgical enhancement of the buttocks 
involves altering not only the buttocks but also the 
dimensions of adjacent regions to give the illu-
sion of more shapely buttocks. Rather than incor-
porating the variations in the waist and thighs 
 
(e.g., “thigh gap”), digital alteration of the but-
tock photographs used in this study focused on 
only one body part—the buttocks. The variables 
of the thighs and waist will be examined in future 
studies to further elucidate the varying compo-
nents contributing to the perfect ideal.
Lastly, intrinsic in any survey-based study, our 
results were dependent on the honesty of our 
respondents in providing their demographic infor-
mation. Unfortunately, approximately 14 percent 
of respondents did not include any demographic 
information, which may have affected our final 
results to a small degree. To improve the accuracy 
of our results, the responses of individuals who did 
not provide this information was not included in 
our demographic data analysis.
Our understanding of the gluteal region and 
the refinement of gluteoplasty techniques has pro-
gressed rapidly within the past decade. Although 
gluteal implants are limited in their ability to con-
tour the periphery of the gluteal region, fat grafts 
offer much more flexibility and can be tailored 
to the patient’s desires. The findings from this 
study serve as a guide for optimal placement of fat 
grafts in gluteoplasty operations. Recent commu-
nication from the U.S. Food and Drug Adminis-
tration has classified adipose cells as human cells, 
tissues, or cellular or tissue-based products that 
are structural.13 At this point, the forecast of gov-
ernment regulation of fat grafting is uncertain. 
Fortunately, fat grafting to the buttocks adds or 
restores structure to this anatomical region, allow-
ing gluteoplasty procedures to fall within the pro-
posed regulatory limitation.
CONCLUSIONS
Ultimately, the aesthetic targeted during glu-
teoplasty procedures should be that which is most 
desirable to the patient. To help with guiding the 
patient and plastic surgeon in the decision-making 
process, this study outlines the most desirable but-
tock proportions based on an anonymous popula-
tion analysis. A more dramatic difference between 
the width of the waist and hip on the posterior 
view was found to be the new ideal and curvier 
than previous standards, signaling an important

preference shift. This information derived from 
this study has the potential to guide gluteoplasty 
surgical planning.
