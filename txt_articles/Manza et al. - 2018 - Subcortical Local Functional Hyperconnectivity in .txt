Abstract
Background—Cannabis abuse has been associated with psychopathology, including negative 
emotionality and a higher risk of psychosis, particularly with early age of initiation. However, the 
mechanisms underlying this association are poorly understood. Because aberrant dopamine (DA) 
signaling is implicated in cannabis-associated psychopathology, we hypothesized that regular 
cannabis abuse (CA) would be associated with altered resting functional connectivity in dopamine 
midbrain-striatal circuits.
Methods—We examined resting brain activity of subcortical regions in 441 young adults from 
the Human Connectome Project, including 30 CA meeting DSM criteria for dependence, and 30 
controls matched on age, sex, education, BMI, anxiety, depression, and alcohol/tobacco usage.
Results—Across all subjects, local functional connectivity density (lFCD) hubs in subcortical 
regions were most prominent in ventral striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, dorsal midbrain, and 
the posterior-ventral brainstem. As hypothesized, CA showed markedly increased lFCD relative to 
controls in ventral striatum (where nucleus accumbens is located) and midbrain (where substantia 
nigra/ventral tegmental nuclei are located) but also in brainstem and lateral thalamus. These effects 
were observed in the absence of significant differences in subcortical volumes, and were most 
pronounced in the individuals who began cannabis use earliest in life and who reported high levels 
of negative emotionality.
Conclusions—Together, these findings suggest that chronic cannabis abuse is associated with 
changes in resting brain function, particularly in dopaminergic nuclei implicated in psychosis but 
that are also critical for habit formation and reward processing. These results shed light on 
neurobiological differences that may be relevant to psychopathology associated with cannabis use.

Introduction
Cannabis is one of the most widely used addictive substances in the United States, with 44% 
of individuals over the age of 12 reporting cannabis use at least once in their lifetime (1). 
Despite current efforts to legalize cannabis, little is known about the long-term effects of 
cannabis abuse (CA) on brain function and neuropsychiatric outcomes. Of particular concern 
has been the association between regular CA and psychiatric symptoms such as amotivation, 
negative emotionality (2, 3) and a heightened risk for psychosis (4). Indeed, CA was 
associated with up to a 6 fold increase in the risk of schizophrenia in early-onset users (5, 6) 
and with the use of cannabis with high THC (7). The increased risk remains after controlling 
for other substances of abuse and for familial risk of psychosis (8). Aberrant dopaminergic 
function in the midbrain-striatal circuitry, a hallmark feature of schizophrenia, may underlie 
this association (9). Accordingly, CA with genetic variants that confer high midbrain-striatal 
dopamine (DA), including the DRD2 rs1076560 T allele, the DAT1 3′ 9-repeat allele, and 
the AKT1 rs2494732 C allele, have an increased risk of psychosis compared with CA that 
do not have these genetic variants (10–12). However, the effects of chronic CA on the 
functional organization of subcortical regions modulated by DA, and their relevance for 
psychiatric symptoms, is poorly understood.
Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) offers a non-invasive method 
for probing the functional connectedness of neural circuits. By measuring correlations 
among spontaneous low-frequency blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signals, studies 
have revealed the involvement of functional changes in subcortical circuits in psychiatric 
diseases including schizophrenia. For instance, functional connectivity between reward 
processing regions, such as nucleus accumbens (NAc) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), 
appears to be related to disrupted DA function, and as such, has clinical relevance: higher 
intrinsic connectivity correlated with amotivation syndrome (13) and with the duration that 
schizophrenia had been left untreated (14). Intriguingly, a similar pattern of NAc-OFC 
hyperconnectivity was reported in CA (15). However, the relevance of these effects for 
psychopathology in CA is unknown. Further, prior investigations in CA have relied mainly 
on seed-based connectivity analyses.
In contrast, local functional connectivity density (lFCD; the size of a local cluster of 
correlated voxels) is a data-driven method for identifying functional hubs in the brain (16). 
lFCD accounts for up to 70% of resting brain metabolism (17), and therefore is an index of 
local brain activity that has superior spatiotemporal resolution to PET imaging. We recently 
used this method to identify functional connectivity changes that were associated with 
cognitive and mood-related behaviors in heavy drinkers (18). To our knowledge, no studies 
have examined the effects of CA on subcortical functional hub organization, and its 
relevance to negative emotionality, which is elevated in CA (3) and schizophrenia (19).

 Intriguingly, recent studies using a very similar approach found subcortical 
hyperconnectivity in a cohort of 95 individuals with Schizophrenia (20). We hypothesized 
similar effects may be observed in CA. To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of the 
large dataset produced by the Human Connectome Project (21). While the HCP does not 
have targeted measures that specifically assess psychosis, they do offer measures of negative 
emotionality, a symptom shared between CA and Schizophrenia (2, 22) that we have 
previously found to be associated with subcortical dopaminergic function in CA (3). Thus, 
while the present study does not directly study individuals with schizophrenia, negative 
emotionality is relevant in light of the emerging view that psychiatric disorders represent 
clusters of symptoms and traits that are elevated over a spectrum of normal functioning (23–
26), and that elevated negative emotionality predicts development of psychosis (27). We 
were particularly interested in one aspect of negative emotionality: symptoms of alienation 
(beliefs that others wish them harm, and that they are deceived by friends), after our recent 
investigation demonstrated that this may be particularly affected in CA and associated with 
aberrant brain function (2).
Materials and Methods
Participants
We analyzed data from the S500 release (https://www.humanconnectome.org/
documentation/S500/index.html) of the WU-Minn HCP Consortium (21). We only included 
participants who had a) complete structural and rsfMRI imaging data that passed a quality 
assurance check, and b) complete measures of cognitive function and emotionality (total 
n=441 participants). The HCP initiative studied young adults aged 22–35 from a wide range 
of backgrounds and behavioral profiles representative of the population at large. Thus, while 
all participants are considered generally healthy, participants with sub-clinical psychiatric 
symptomatology and recreational drug use are included.
Of the 441 participants, 36 met the DSM-IV criteria for cannabis dependence (see 
Supplementary Material for a description). Three participants were excluded for comorbid 
alcohol dependence and one was excluded for anxiety and depression ratings > 3 SD from 
the group mean. Recent studies have indicated that it is critical in studies of cannabis abuse 
to select a well-matched control group, particularly on measures of alcohol and tobacco 
usage, e.g., (28). Therefore, we matched groups on age, sex, education, BMI, anxiety, 
depression, and alcohol and tobacco usage (we calculated composite tobacco/alcohol usage 
the same way as a recent study of HCP data; see Supplementary Material and (29)). Two 
subjects from each group were excluded to ensure groups were matched on tobacco usage 
(Supplementary Material), therefore the final sample included 30 CA and 30 controls; 
demographics and statistical tests are presented in Table 1.
Behavioral Measures of Interest
We examined data related to cognitive function and negative emotionality, given the interest 
in potential chronic effects of cannabis in these domains (30). Participants completed various 
NIH toolbox measures as part of the HCP. We were particularly interested in relating the 
current work to our previous findings that CA are vulnerable to feelings of alienation, i.e. the

 belief that others wish them harm, and that they are betrayed or deceived by friends (2). 
However, our previous work used the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire (MPQ) 
and this was not administered as part of the HCP protocol. Therefore, we attempted to find 
analogous measures for the three main domains of the MPQ: stress reactivity, aggression, 
and alienation. For stress reactivity, we used the “perceived stress” measure; for aggression, 
we averaged together the Z-scores of “Anger Hostility” and “Anger Aggression” (i.e., one’s 
own behavior in the anger and aggressive domains); and for alienation we averaged together 
the Z-scores of “Perceived Hostility” and “Perceived Rejection” (i.e., how one perceives 
others behaving towards them). We then averaged together these stress, aggression, and 
alienation measures together for a composite negative emotionality score. All three domains 
were included to examine if the effects were specific to alienation. More comprehensive 
descriptions of cognitive and emotional measures are available in Supplementary Material 
and https://wiki.humanconnectome.org/display/PublicData/HCP+Data+Dictionary+Public

MRI image acquisition and preprocessing
All brain images were collected on a Siemens 3T “connectome Skyra” scanner with a 32-
channel coil at Washington University in St. Louis. T1- and T2-weighted anatomical scans 
were acquired (FOV=224 mm, matrix=320, 256 slices, 0.7 mm isotropic voxels). rsfMRI 
scans were acquired with an EPI sequence (Multiband factor = 8, TR = 720 ms, TE = 33.1 
ms, flip angle = 52°, FOV = 208 mm, 104 × 90 matrix, 72 slices of 2 mm isotropic voxels, 
no gap). Two sessions were completed with two rsfMRI scans (one LR and one RL phase 
encoding) in each session. Each scan was 14:33 min, for a total of 54:15 min. For rsfMRI, 
participants were instructed to lie with eyes open, to relax and look at a white cross on a 
dark background, think of nothing and to not fall asleep. For further details on image 
acquisition, see https://www.humanconnectome.org/documentation/S500/
HCP_S500+MEG2_Release_Appendix_I.pdf.
For analysis of rsfMRI data, we used the “minimal preprocessing” datasets 
(hp2000_clean.nii files), where preprocessing included: a) gradient distortion correction, b) 
rigid body realignment, c) field map processing, d) nonlinear normalization to MNI space, e) 
high-pass filtering with independent component analysis (ICA)-based denoising, and f) brain 
masking. In our own subsequent preprocessing, we removed timepoints that were severely 
affected by motion using a ‘scrubbing’ approach (Supplementary Material). Remaining 
motion effects on fMRI time series were regressed out using the six translation and rotation 
regressors. Finally, band-pass temporal filtering (0.01–0.10 Hz) was applied. lFCD was 
computed separately on each of the four runs of processed, unsmoothed data, masked by 
each participant’s FreeSurfer subcortical parcellation (wmparc.2.nii.gz), which included 
bilateral thalamus, caudate, putamen, pallidum, amygdala, nucleus accumbens, 
hippocampus, midbrain and brainstem (see Local FCD section below). Finally, the four 
resulting lFCD maps (LR/RL; REST1/REST2) were averaged together and averaged images 
were smoothed at 2mm FWHM.

 Local FCD (lFCD) analysis
The Pearson correlation was used to assess the strength of functional connectivity, Cij, 
between voxels i and j. A positive correlation threshold of r = 0.2 (sufficient to Bonferroni 
correct for the number of correlations performed in the subcortical mask, p < 1 × 10−4) was 
used to compute the binary connectivity coefficients, aij = 1 (if Cij > 0.2) or aij = 0 (if Cij ≤ 
0.2). This threshold was lower than previous investigations (16) to have sensitivity to detect 
effects in subcortical regions that have noisier signals than the neocortex, and hence have 
weaker observed resting-state correlations (31). The local FCD (or ‘local degree’) for voxel i 
was computed as the size of a continuous cluster of voxels with aij = 1, that are connected by 
surface. A ‘growing’ algorithm was used for time-efficient estimation of lFCD (16).
Seed-based functional connectivity analysis
To examine functional connectivity differences with other regions of the brain, we computed 
seed-based connectivity using the same methods as our previous work (32, 33; 
Supplementary Material).
Statistical analysis
Second-level statistical analyses were conducted in SPM12 (http://
www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/) for imaging data and in Graphpad Prism 7.02 (San 
Diego, CA) for behavioral data. First, to examine lFCD across the larger population, we 
conducted a one-sample T-test of lFCD across all 441 participants. Next, to compare CA 
with the matched control group, we conducted a two-sample T-test of lFCD between groups. 
These analyses were thresholded at p < .001, uncorrected, with a cluster-level correction of p 
< .05 family-wise error (FWE) corrected, and a minimum cluster size of k = 100 voxels. To 
control cluster-level type I error rates (34), we calculated cluster corrections with the 
Statistical nonparametric mapping toolbox (SnPM13: http://warwick.ac.uk/snpm; 5000 
permutations). Because lFCD has a power law distribution (16), we also conducted analyses 
with log-transformed lFCD values; this did not alter the findings, and so we report these data 
in Supplementary material. We also conducted two-sample T-tests on the volume of 
subcortical nuclei (from FreeSurfer output), as well as measures of cognition and negative 
emotionality. To examine if subcortical lFCD had relevance for aberrant cognition and/or 
negative emotionality in CA, we conducted correlation analysis between lFCD in regions 
showing significant group differences and in behavioral measures showing significant group 
differences.
Results
Demographics and behavioral measures
Demographics and lifestyle factors with descriptive statistics are presented in Table 1. The 
groups did not significantly differ on any of the DSM-oriented scales, including depression, 
ADHD, panic disorder, agoraphobia, anxiety, and somatic problems (all p’s > .15), except 
the CA group reported higher levels of antisocial behavior (p = .05) and more childhood 
conduct problems (p = .008). Cognitive scores and measures of negative emotionality are 
presented in Table 2. Notably, while there were no obvious differences in cognitive

 performance, the CA group showed significantly higher levels of negative emotionality 
(t(58) = 2.14, p = .036), particularly alienation (t(58) = 2.34, p = .023), in line with our 
previous work (2, 3).
Subcortical Volume
Volumetric data and descriptive statistics are reported in Supplementary Table S1. In line 
with recent work (28, 29), no subcortical regions showed significantly different volume 
between CA and controls. However, CA did show a trend towards smaller volume of the left 
hippocampus (p = .068), consistent with findings of structural hippocampal abnormalities by 
prior studies in CA (35).
lFCD Analyses
We first conducted a voxelwise one-sample t-test of lFCD across all 441 participants. 
Results showed widespread lFCD; to summarize, peaks were observed in ventral striatum, 
hippocampus, amygdala, midbrain, and the posterior-ventral brainstem (Figure 1; see 
Supplementary Figure S2 for maps restricted to CA and control groups). We then examined 
group differences in lFCD between CA and matched controls. In voxelwise two-sample T-
tests, CA demonstrated significantly higher lFCD in the ventral striatum, dorsal midbrain 
(including substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area), brainstem, and lateral thalamus (all 
p’s < 1×10−5, Figure 2a,b). Motion estimates were highly similar between the CA and 
control groups (mean framewise displacement across all images for CA: 0.171 ± 0.05, and 
for controls: 0.163 ± 0.05; t(58) = −.557, p = .580); results were nearly identical when 
including motion or FreeSurfer-estimated subcortical volume as covariates in the model. 
Because the lFCD values across these four ROIs was highly correlated across subjects (mean 
bivariate correlation: r = 0.78), we averaged together the lFCD values across the four ROIs 
to increase statistical power; subsequent analyses refer to this averaged value. This averaged 
lFCD value did not significantly correlate with FreeSurfer subcortical volume estimates 
across subjects (r = −.10, p = .432).
In whole-brain functional connectivity analysis using the four clusters from Figure 2A as 
seed regions, no significant between-group differences emerged at an exploratory threshold 
of p < .005 uncorrected.
Early onset of cannabis abuse in life is associated with a higher risk for poor 
neuropsychiatric outcomes (36). Therefore, we ran a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
between subcortical lFCD and self-reported age of first use. Indeed, subcortical lFCD was 
significantly different across age of first use, F(4,55) = 4.13, p = .005, such that higher lFCD 
was associated with earlier age of cannabis use onset (Figure 3a). In a two-way ANOVA 
including group and sex as factors, there was no significant main effect of sex on lFCD 
(F(1,56) = .49, p = .488), nor was there a significant group by sex interaction (F(1,56) = .09, 
p = .761). Finally, because CA reported significantly higher feelings of alienation than 
controls, in line with our previous work (2), we ran an across-subject correlation between the 
alienation scores and subcortical lFCD. CA showed a significant correlation between lFCD 
and alienation scores (r = .43, p = .019), whereas the control subjects did not (r = −.09, p = .
615) (Figure 3b). The correlation among CA may be most strongly driven by lFCD near the

 midbrain; see Supplementary Figure S3 for a voxelwise regression analysis. These results 
remained significant when conducting a partial correlation to control for the FreeSurfer-
estimated subcortical volume of each subject (CA: r = .43, p = .04; controls: r = .02, p = .
895). The difference in slopes between CA and controls was significant, F(1,56) = 5.95, p = .
018.
Discussion
Despite the high prevalence of cannabis use, little is known about potential chronic effects of 
CA on brain function and behavior. Here, we demonstrate that heavy CA is associated with a 
marked increase in subcortical lFCD, including the midbrain (where the main DA nuclei are 
located) and the ventral striatum, relative to a well-matched control group. These effects are 
not explained by volumetric differences, and they associate with critical features of CA: 
hyperconnectivity was most pronounced in early-onset CA, a demographic that is 
particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of CA (36), and in those reporting the highest 
levels of negative emotionality, particularly alienation. These findings indicate that the 
resting functional organization of the subcortical regions is altered in CA, and this may have 
relevance for some of the adverse effects of early-onset CA, including emotional disturbance 
and increased risk for psychosis.
Increased lFCD in the ventral striatum (VS) and midbrain, including regions where the 
substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area are located, may be related to hyperdopaminergia 
in CA. Indeed, using PET and [11C]raclopride to measure DA-induced changes to 
methylphenidate we found that CA when compared to controls showed increased DA release 
in the midbrain, though they showed an attenuated response in striatal regions (3). 
Functional connectivity between VS and VTA is higher in patients with Schizophrenia with 
symptoms of hyperdopaminergia, such as auditory and visual hallucinations, than in patients 
who do not experience these symptoms (37). Further, in healthy adults and in rats, drugs that 
increase (levodopa) and decrease (haloperidol) DA signaling have been demonstrated to 
increase and decrease functional connectivity of these regions, respectively (38, 39). 
However, it is important to note that the findings from these seed-based connectivity studies 
are likely network-specific, because abnormal DA levels attenuate the connectivity between 
different resting state networks (33, 39). This may explain why CA show hypoconnectivity 
between nodes of the mesolimbic reward network and nodes of the salience network; e.g. 
between the dopaminergic midbrain and insula (40) and between NAc and dorsal anterior 
cingulate cortex (41). Interestingly, our seed-based connectivity analysis from these regions 
did not yield significant group differences. Thus, while previous studies have observed long-
range subcortical-cortical connectivity alterations in CA, the current results appear to be 
confined to local hub differences in subcortical circuits. There are at least two possible 
explanations for this. First, this study carefully controlled for factors such as alcohol and 
tobacco usage, which may have influenced findings from previous studies. Second, the HCP 
uses a high-resolution sequence with an aggressive multiband factor, and this contributes to 
lower subcortical signal-to-noise ratio than is observed with low-resolution sequences. lFCD 
is more resilient to noise than seed-voxel correlations because lFCD capitalizes on locally 
shared synchrony and high sampling rate, which makes it possible to reach significant 
correlations in the absence of significant long-range synchrony. Nevertheless, our lFCD

 results seem to be broadly in line with previous studies using the FCD technique, although 
evidence is limited. For instance, subcortical global FCD (a measure that is highly correlated 
with lFCD, (42)) is increased in schizophrenia relative to healthy controls ((20), but see (35), 
where the dopaminergic medication status of the patients was unknown).
On the other hand, increased lFCD in the VS and midbrain may be a general consequence of 
pathology to these circuits, as this pattern is observed in various conditions with aberrant DA 
signaling. Subcortical lFCD is increased in aging (44), ADHD (45), and cocaine use 
disorder (46), which are all implicated in altered dopaminergic function (47–49). These 
results are also generally in line with the notion that altered connectivity in high-cost hubs is 
linked to neuropsychiatric disease burden (50). An important next step is to examine how 
tonic, resting subcortical hyperconnectivity may have consequences for phasic DA-
dependent processes that are altered in CA, such as punishment-based learning. CA show 
altered subcortical activations and impaired learning from non-drug rewards and punishment 
(51, 52). If higher resting subcortical lFCD is indeed due to higher tonic DA transmission, 
then this increased baseline activity would confer weaker ability to generate the “dips” in 
activity necessary to learn from negative outcomes, in line with extant models of 
dopaminergic function (53). Future studies with combined PET-fMRI could examine this 
possibility.
We also observed heightened lFCD in CA relative to controls in the pulvinar nucleus of the 
thalamus and in the brainstem, regions critical for sensory processing and maintenance of 
autonomic functions, respectively. CA is hypothesized to increase thalamic neuronal 
excitability, disrupt burst firing patterns and impair thalamocortical connectivity, leading to 
impaired sensory processing (54). In correspondence, we find increased local thalamic 
connectivity while others found decreased thalamocortical connectivity in CA (55), and both 
are exacerbated in early-onset CA. In addition, CA show hyperactive thalamic responses to 
cannabis cues, which correlate with subjective craving of cannabis and are thought to 
contribute to sensorimotor deficits (56, 57). There has been comparatively less attention on 
changes to brainstem function in CA, perhaps because this region has lower concentrations 
of cannabinoid receptors than the basal ganglia (58). Yet CA impacts functions regulated by 
the brainstem region identified here, which includes the ventral raphe nuclei extending into 
the nucleus of the solitary tract. For instance, regular CA disrupts rapid eye movement 
(REM) sleep and increases insomnia (59, 60) and negatively influences mood (61). 
Interestingly, in individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder, sleep disturbance is 
associated with heightened brainstem glucose metabolism (62), a measure that strongly 
correlates with lFCD (17). More work is needed to describe how changes to brain functional 
organization in CA have relevance for sensory and autonomic functions.
Finally, subcortical hyperconnectivity was most pronounced in early-onset CA and 
correlated with feelings of alienation (especially in the midbrain). CA is thought to be 
particularly detrimental in adolescence because the brain is in a critical period of increased 
myelination and extensive synaptic pruning (63). Subcortical cannabinoid receptor 
development is ongoing at this time, and exogenous cannabis perturbs the normal 
development of the mesolimbic system, which is thought to contribute to psychopathology 
(64). It is well-established that early-onset CA have poor cognitive and emotional outcomes

 (36), but the neural basis of this phenomenon is not well understood. Prior rsfMRI studies 
suggested that increased functional connectivity within cortical networks involved in self-
awareness, including the salience and default-mode networks, could lead to aberrant 
emotional/motivational processing (40). We also recently showed that glucose metabolism in 
inferior frontal gyrus negatively correlated with feelings of alienation in CA (2). These 
findings, together with the current data provide convergent evidence supporting the notion 
that impaired prefrontal regulation of subcortical activity contributes to the negative 
emotionality seen in addictions (3, 47).
The data presented here build on the small body of work in CA using HCP data. An initial 
investigation using structural MRI data found that effects of cannabis exposure on 
subcortical volumetry were minimal, but critically, they concluded that cannabis effects may 
be stronger in DA-rich regions including the VS and in the most frequent CA (65). Another 
diffusion-tensor imaging study examined 466 individuals reporting at least one lifetime 
experience with cannabis, and found that frequency of cannabis use did not associate with 
cortical volumes, but did associate with changes to the shape of the amygdala and 
hippocampus (29). Most notably, they observed that early-onset CA was associated with 
altered shape of the nucleus accumbens and loss of white matter integrity throughout the 
cortex. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to extend HCP investigations of CA 
to rsfMRI data. Because the HCP project is open access, there is a rich opportunity for 
further examination of the chronic effects of CA using a common dataset.
Limitations
The HCP does not have in vivo measures of subcortical DA release or receptor function, and 
so we could not directly assess the hypothesis of hyperdopaminergia and psychosis risk in 
CA. Resting-state lFCD is an indirect measure of neuronal activity and the true 
neurobiological basis of this measure needs further exploration. Further, how exactly 
hyperdopaminergia manifests at the neural level is disputed. While CA with psychosis do 
not show elevated striatal DA release, stimulant-induced changes in DA correlate with 
psychosis, suggesting that hyperdopaminergia may be more related to postsynaptic 
hypersensitivity than to total levels of synaptic DA (66, 67). Nevertheless, the final release of 
the HCP will include single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for all participants; future 
studies should examine how genetic differences predicting D2/3 function, e.g. Taq1A and 
C957T SNPs, predict risk for CA and subcortical lFCD, which would help shed light on this 
issue. Additionally, it remains unknown whether emotional disturbance is directly caused by 
CA or if individuals use cannabis to self-medicate feelings of negative emotionality (30). 
Finally, we cannot rule out the possibility that subcortical hyperconnectivity may be 
associated with cannabis withdrawal and the extent to which it abates with prolonged 
abstinence, as has been observed with other functional connectivity abnormalities in CA 
(41).
Conclusion
Despite increased usage of cannabis worldwide, little is known about the neuropsychiatric 
effects of CA, especially in early-onset users. Here we show that resting connectivity of 
subcortical functional hubs, particularly within dopaminergic nuclei implicated in

 psychopathology, is greatly increased in CA. This pattern was exaggerated in individuals 
who began using in early adolescence and were associated with high levels of negative 
emotionality. Thus, subcortical functional connectivity may be a useful marker for tracking 
the development of psychopathology with prolonged CA.
