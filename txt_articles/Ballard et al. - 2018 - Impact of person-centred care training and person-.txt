Abstract
Background
Agitation is a common, challenging symptom affecting large numbers of people with demen-
tia and impacting on quality of life (QoL). There is an urgent need for evidence-based, cost-
effective psychosocial interventions to improve these outcomes, particularly in the absence
of safe, effective pharmacological therapies. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a
person-centred care and psychosocial intervention incorporating an antipsychotic review,
WHELD, on QoL, agitation, and antipsychotic use in people with dementia living in nursing
homes, and to determine its cost.
Methods and findings
This was a randomised controlled cluster trial conducted between 1 January 2013 and 30
September 2015 that compared the WHELD intervention with treatment as usual (TAU) in
people with dementia living in 69 UK nursing homes, using an intention to treat analysis. All
nursing homes allocated to the intervention received staff training in person-centred care
and social interaction and education regarding antipsychotic medications (antipsychotic
review), followed by ongoing delivery through a care staff champion model. The primary out-
come measure was QoL (DEMQOL-Proxy). Secondary outcomes were agitation (Cohen-
Mansfield Agitation Inventory [CMAI]), neuropsychiatric symptoms (Neuropsychiatric

Dementia Rating), mood (Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia), unmet needs (Cam-
berwell Assessment of Need for the Elderly), mortality, quality of interactions (Quality of
Interactions Scale [QUIS]), pain (Abbey Pain Scale), and cost. Costs were calculated using
cost function figures compared with usual costs. In all, 847 people were randomised to
WHELD or TAU, of whom 553 completed the 9-month randomised controlled trial. The inter-
vention conferred a statistically significant improvement in QoL (DEMQOL-Proxy Z score
2.82, p = 0.0042; mean difference 2.54, SEM 0.88; 95% CI 0.81, 4.28; Cohen’s D effect size
0.24). There were also statistically significant benefits in agitation (CMAI Z score 2.68, p =
0.0076; mean difference 4.27, SEM 1.59; 95% CI −7.39, −1.15; Cohen’s D 0.23) and overall
neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPI-NH Z score 3.52, p < 0.001; mean difference 4.55, SEM
1.28; 95% CI −7.07,−2.02; Cohen’s D 0.30). Benefits were greatest in people with moder-
ately severe dementia. There was a statistically significant benefit in positive care interac-
tions as measured by QUIS (19.7% increase, SEM 8.94; 95% CI 2.12, 37.16, p = 0.03;
Cohen’s D 0.55). There were no statistically significant differences between WHELD and
TAU for the other outcomes. A sensitivity analysis using a pre-specified imputation model
confirmed statistically significant benefits in DEMQOL-Proxy, CMAI, and NPI-NH outcomes
with the WHELD intervention. Antipsychotic drug use was at a low stable level in both treat-
ment groups, and the intervention did not reduce use. The WHELD intervention reduced
cost compared to TAU, and the benefits achieved were therefore associated with a cost sav-
ing. The main limitation was that antipsychotic review was based on augmenting processes
within care homes to trigger medical review and did not in this study involve proactive pri-
mary care education. An additional limitation was the inherent challenge of assessing QoL
in this patient group.
Conclusions
These findings suggest that the WHELD intervention confers benefits in terms of QoL, agita-
tion, and neuropsychiatric symptoms, albeit with relatively small effect sizes, as well as cost
saving in a model that can readily be implemented in nursing homes. Future work should
consider how to facilitate sustainability of the intervention in this setting.

 What did the researchers do and find?
• We tested the WHELD programme, which combined staff training, social interaction,
and guidance on use of antipsychotic medications, in 69 UK care homes in a 9-month
clinical trial.
• We showed that care homes receiving the WHELD programme saw improvements in
quality of life as well as other important symptoms including agitation, behaviour, and
pain in people with dementia.
• The WHELD programme was also shown to be cost-effective.
What do these findings mean?
• The findings show that the WHELD approach is beneficial for people with dementia liv-
ing in care homes.
• WHELD could be provided in an affordable way to improve the lives of these individu-
als, who often do not receive the care they need.
Introduction
There are 46.8 million people with dementia worldwide, many of whom reside in nursing
homes. In the UK one-third of people with dementia live in care homes [1], and in the US 64%
of people receiving Medicare in nursing homes have dementia [2], demonstrating the interna-
tional impact of the condition. The majority of these individuals have moderate or severe
dementia and have highly complex care needs resulting from a combination of cognitive, func-
tional, and communication impairments; neuropsychiatric symptoms; and medical comorbid-
ity, all of which combine to impact on quality of life (QoL). Interventions to promote QoL in
dementia are limited in the literature, and few trials have examined impacts on this important
outcome. Despite the close link of QoL to agitation and other neuropsychiatric symptoms, risk
of falls, worsening cognition, and mortality, none of the 18 randomised controlled trials
(RCTs) found in 2 systematic reviews of antipsychotic medication use in individuals with
dementia measured QoL as an outcome [3,4]. There is considerable potential for non-drug
approaches to address major drivers of QoL, and a recent systematic review particularly
highlighted the benefit conferred by social interaction and pleasant activities in decreasing
both agitation and antipsychotic use [5]. To date, interventions to promote person-centred
care (PCC) have not achieved a significant improvement in QoL for people with dementia [6–
8]. The exception is a recently published intensive proof-of-concept study that confirmed the
added benefits of combining PCC training for care staff, antipsychotic review, and social inter-
action—the WHELD intervention—and demonstrated significant benefits in QoL, as well as a
significant reduction in antipsychotic use [9].
Neuropsychiatric symptoms affect 90% of people with dementia at some point during the
course of their condition [10]. Agitation, frequently including aggression, is particularly com-
mon amongst those with moderate to severe dementia living in nursing homes, where the
cross-sectional prevalence of these symptoms exceeds 50% [11]. Agitation is associated with
increased distress in residents and an increased burden for family and professional caregivers
[4] and is one of the most challenging symptoms for clinical management. Importantly,

 agitation is closely associated with reduced QoL in people with dementia. There is evidence to
support modest benefits of antipsychotic treatment for some symptoms of agitation, particu-
larly risperidone, olanzapine, and aripiprazole for the short-term management of severe
aggression. The benefits for other symptoms of agitation and with longer term treatment are
less clear [12–15]. Moreover, antipsychotics are associated with severe safety concerns includ-
ing increased cognitive decline, stroke, and death, particularly when used in the long term
[13,15–17]. Best practice guidance emphasises the importance of frequent monitoring and
judicious prescribing in order to reduce these risks but also to ensure identification of situa-
tions where antipsychotic use is warranted [18,19]. Recent studies also highlight emerging
pharmacological alternatives to antipsychotic medications. The CitAD trial examined treat-
ment with citalopram for 9 weeks in 186 people with Alzheimer disease and reported a signifi-
cant reduction in agitation (odds ratio 2.13, p = 0.01) and caregiver distress [20], and a trial of
dextromethorphan-quinidine in 194 people with Alzheimer disease reported a clinically rele-
vant benefit for agitation (ordinary least squares Z statistic −3.95, p < 0.001) over a 10-week
treatment period [21]. Whilst this emerging evidence base is promising, there were safety con-
cerns with citalopram, and both the citalopram and dextromethorphan-quinidine studies only
evaluated relatively short-term therapy (9–10 weeks). There is also currently a lack of evidence
supporting sustained benefit for any current pharmacological treatment for agitation.
Livingston and colleagues [22] in a comprehensive systematic review examined the benefits
of a range of sensory, psychological, and behavioural interventions in the treatment of agita-
tion. The authors identified 160 clinical trials and reported promising indications of benefit
across a range of interventions. A parallel systematic review concentrating specifically on psy-
chological and behavioural interventions identified 40 clinical trials in people with dementia,
and, together with other key studies, highlights the potential value of enjoyable activities as a
successful treatment approach for agitation [5,23,24]. A more specific systematic review and
meta-analysis concentrating on parallel group clinical trials of dementia-related PCC training
identified 5 trials. A meta-analysis of these studies demonstrated significant benefits in the
treatment of agitation and in achieving reductions in the use of antipsychotic medications.
However, no significant benefits in improving QoL were achieved [8]. This literature high-
lights the growing evidence base to support the value of PCC and non-pharmacological inter-
ventions for the management of agitation and reduction of antipsychotic use for people with
dementia in nursing homes, which was further augmented by a recently published factorial
study of the WHELD intervention [9].
Cost is a major consideration in the development and implementation of interventions in
nursing homes [5,8,9]. None of the evidence-based interventions to promote PCC have been
widely adopted in clinical and care practice, and this is likely due in part to a lack of robust evi-
dence regarding the cost profile of these approaches. A potentially cost-effective, practical
means of overcoming this issue is to deliver interventions through a champion model,
enabling care staff to take ownership for ongoing implementation in the care home, with more
limited supervision from external therapists.
The goal of this RCT was to evaluate the impact of the WHELD intervention on QoL, agita-
tion, neuropsychiatric symptoms, antipsychotic use, global deterioration, mood, unmet needs,
mortality, quality of interactions, pain, and cost in comparison to treatment as usual (TAU).
Methods
Study design
This study was a 9-month cluster-randomised controlled 2-arm trial conducted in 69 UK
nursing homes between 1 January 2013 and 30 September 2015. There were 3 recruiting hubs

 based in South London, North London, and Buckinghamshire. Each cluster was randomised
to receive either the WHELD intervention or TAU for 9 months. This research was reviewed
and approved by the Oxford C National Research Ethics Committee (Ref: 13/SC/0281). This
study is registered with the ISRCTN Registry (Ref: ISRCTN62237498). The full protocol is
available in the published protocol paper [25].
Eligibility criteria
Eligible nursing homes had at least 60% of residents with dementia. Nursing homes were
excluded if they were receiving special support from their local authority or if they failed to
meet the 5 Care Quality Commission care home quality standards. Within each participating
nursing home, all residents were considered potentially eligible for inclusion if they met crite-
ria for dementia (defined as a score 1 or greater on the Clinical Dementia Rating [CDR] [26],
operationalized to require a minimum level of cognitive, functional, and neuropsychiatric
features).
Interventions
The WHELD intervention consisted of a combination of elements taken from the interven-
tions evaluated in a previous proof-of-concept study [9]. The intervention focused on training
in PCC for care staff and on promoting tailored person-centred activities and social interac-
tions. The intervention also involved the development of a system for triggering appropriate
review of antipsychotic medications by the prescribing physician attached to each home.
Training for staff was provided by a research therapist. Two lead care staff members
(WHELD champions) were nominated in each care home. These individuals received addi-
tional training over a period of 4 months (1 training day per month) with further coaching,
supervision, and regular review with the therapist over the 9-month period. The WHELD
champions were responsible for the delivery and dissemination of the intervention in each
care home. In addition, prescribing physicians were provided with educational materials about
the intervention. The control group received TAU. The WHELD intervention is described in
more detail in Box 1 and S1 Table.

 Outcome measures
All care home residents were assessed for dementia severity at baseline using the CDR [26], a
validated scale that quantifies the severity of dementia using a structured interview, and the
Functional Assessment Staging Tool (FAST) [27], a validated functional ordinal assessment
scale for elderly people with dementia.
All outcome measures were assessed prior to randomisation and after 9 months of the inter-
vention by a trained research assistant. The assessments at follow-up were collected by
research assistants who had not previously visited the participating care homes. The research
assistants were blind to treatment allocation, and every effort was made to maintain the blind
by minimising contact between the research assistants and research therapists, ensuring that
(1) Months 2–5: Training delivered to WHELD champions off-site from the care home
where they work for 1 day (6 hours) per month for each care home.
Delivered by: WHELD therapist.
Participants: WHELD champions from care homes.
Aims:
• Day 1: Understanding what PCC is and how homes can apply it in the care of resi-
dents. Developing ways to share this information with colleagues within the home.
• Day 2: Writing strengths-based care plans and providing tailored, structured social
activities that recognise people’s abilities and interests, with the aim of providing 60
minutes per week per person.
• Day 3: Understanding the evidence about the use of antipsychotic medication and
familiarisation with best practice guidelines and considering ways care homes could
work with their local general practitioners.
• Day 4: Developing ways to understand the individual needs of people who are dis-
tressed (sometimes referred to as “challenging behaviour”) using formulation of a
need-based model and identifying ways of using information gained through PCC/
care planning (sessions 1 and 2) to meet these needs.
Delivery style: All sessions were manualised and involved didactic sessions, experiential
learning, individual goal setting for each care home for dissemination of training infor-
mation, and implementation activities between training sessions.
(2) Months 6–9: On-site consultation sessions totalling 8 hours per month with each
care home, delivered flexibly, by negotiation, to best support each care home’s needs.
(3) Concurrently in months 2–9: Cascade training and implementation of activities.
Training delivered by: WHELD champions.
Activities developed by: WHELD champions and staff team members.
Delivery style: Adapted for care setting involved as standalone training sessions, model-
ling skills, incorporating sessions into daily routine, working with individual residents to
develop personalised and tailored activities for 60 minutes a week, care home team for-
mulation, and medication review and goal planning sessions to influence care planning.

 WHELD champions were not informants, and giving clear instructions to care homes and the
research team to not disclose treatment allocation. The primary outcome was QoL, measured
by the DEMQOL-Proxy [28], a 31-item interviewer-administered questionnaire answered by a
caregiver, with a score range of 31 to 124 that assesses the QoL for people with dementia.
The secondary outcome measures included agitation assessed using the Cohen-Mansfield
Agitation Inventory (CMAI) [29], a caregiver questionnaire of agitation completed through an
interview with the caregiver, consisting of 29 items, each of which is rated on a 7-point scale of
frequency. Information regarding antipsychotic use and the use of other psychotropic medica-
tions was recorded from medication charts. Overall neuropsychiatric symptoms were assessed
with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory–Nursing Home Version (NPI-NH). The NPI-NH [30,31]
was developed to assess psychopathology in patients with dementia in nursing homes and eval-
uates 12 neuropsychiatric disturbances common in dementia: delusions, hallucinations, agita-
tion, dysphoria, anxiety, apathy, irritability, euphoria, disinhibition, aberrant motor behaviour,
night-time behaviour disturbances, and appetite and eating abnormalities. The score of each
item, if present, represents the product of symptom frequency and severity, with a maximum
score of 12 for each domain. Secondary outcomes also included global deterioration (CDR)
[26], mood (Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia [CSSD]) [32], antipsychotic use, unmet
needs (Camberwell Assessment of Need for the Elderly [CANE]) [33], quality of interactions
(Quality of Interactions Scale [QUIS]) [34], pain (Abbey Pain Scale) [35], mortality, and cost.
Economic data for each individual in the study were collected using an adapted version of the
Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI) [36,37], which includes questions about the individual’s
sociodemographic profile, care home charges, and use of health and social care services. In addi-
tion, the staffing inputs of the optimised intervention were measured and covered time spent by
the WHELD therapist and WHELD champion in training, supervision, and preparation.
Randomisation and blinding
Nursing homes were allocated to receive either the WHELD intervention or TAU using secure
web access to the remote randomisation centre at the North Wales Organisation for Rando-
mised Trials in Health Clinical Trial Unit (NWORTH CTU) at Bangor University. Randomi-
sation was performed by dynamic allocation [38] to protect against subversion while ensuring
that the trial maintained a good balance to the allocation ratio of 1:1 both within each stratifi-
cation variable and across the trial. Nursing homes were stratified by region and size. The sys-
tem was coded and validated in the R statistical package. The NWORTH CTU generated
randomisation codes and assigned clusters to intervention groups. This information was
passed to the trial manager, and passed on to the principal investigator for each site only once
all baseline evaluations had been completed.
Individual participants were consented and evaluated for dementia prior to randomisation
of the nursing homes to minimise bias. Written consent was provided by participants when
they had mental capacity to provide consent for their own participation. Written consent was
provided by next of kin when individuals did not have mental capacity to consent for them-
selves. Clinicians and research assistants completing follow-up assessments were blind to treat-
ment allocation. Every attempt was made to minimise accidental un-blinding by minimising
contact between therapists and the researchers collecting outcome data and with clear instruc-
tions to researchers and nursing home staff to not discuss treatment allocation.
Sample size
The target minimum sample size was 640 at the 9-month time point. Previous studies indi-
cated that intra-home correlation coefficients rarely exceed 0.05. Taking this into account, a

 sample size of 640 participants therefore gives 90% power using a significance level of 5% to
detect a standardised effect size of 0.3 SDs, which is generally accepted as the lowest threshold
of a clinically meaningful benefit. The recruitment of a minimum of 840 participants allowed
for loss of 200 through mortality or withdrawal, an important consideration in the context of
the high morbidity and mortality of this group.
Data analysis
Outcome measures for the study were assessed at baseline and at 9 months. All the outcome
measures collected were described and reported using appropriate descriptive statistics and
tabular and graphical techniques. Means with 95% confidence intervals are quoted, and a 5%
significance level is reported. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT)
diagram information is presented in order to identify any differential dropout between the
arms of the trial. The analysis of the quantitative outcomes was undertaken using a multilevel
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA).
The primary outcome measure (DEMQOL-Proxy) and the secondary outcome measures
were analysed using the multilevel modelling approach to ANCOVA, with the value at 9
months as the response. The baseline value was the covariate. The key factor was group (treat-
ment [WHELD] or control [TAU]). The multilevel nature of the design was represented by 2
levels: care home and individual residents in the care home. Other covariates were number of
residents in each cluster and the age, sex, and severity of dementia (FAST stage—baseline and
follow-up) of participants with dementia. The provisional analysis plan was developed based
on the analysis model developed for a previous smaller factorial study of the WHELD inter-
vention [9]. In addition to the standard ANCOVA model, this included work to model and
identify the best fit for the inclusion of baseline covariates and the evaluation of several impu-
tation models. The same baseline covariate model was used in the final analysis plan for the
current study. The imputation model was less predictive in validation analyses than it had
been in the factorial study. The completer analysis was therefore used as the primary outcome
in place of the imputation analysis. Therefore, the primary analysis included all participants
with data available at the 9-month assessment point, and the imputation model was used as a
sensitivity analysis. The analysis model was finalised prior to the locking of the study database
for the current trial.
The same approach was used for the analysis of all secondary outcomes other than mortal-
ity, antipsychotic use, QUIS, and cost, except that the respective baseline variables were used
as covariates rather than baseline DEMQOL-Proxy.
Mortality and antipsychotic use were compared between treatment groups using relative
risk with 95% CI. QUIS used care-home-level data, and was compared between treatment
groups using ANCOVA, but because of the smaller sample size did not use baseline covariates.
Further exploratory sub-group analysis was undertaken evaluating differences between
WHELD and TAU in people with mild to moderate (FAST 4–5), moderately severe (FAST 6),
and severe dementia (FAST 7) based on the recommendations of reviewers as part of the jour-
nal submission process. Based on reviewer recommendations, effect sizes and number needed
to treat were also evaluated.
Cost analysis
Total costs for each participant were derived from the collection of service use data for the
3-month period prior to the intervention (baseline) and the 9 months of the intervention (fol-
low-up) and consisted of 3 main cost categories: intervention costs, accommodation charges,
and health and social care costs. Intervention costs were calculated by deriving average hourly

 costs for WHELD champions and therapists, combined with time spent by each staff type on
training, supervision, and intervention delivery, and were defined as a per participant cost. An
additional cost was defined for the antipsychotic review element of the intervention for partici-
pants receiving antipsychotics. Accommodation costs were collected as weekly charges for
each nursing home. Where this was unavailable or not known, the typical charge for a resident
with a level of need similar to that of the participant in the study was obtained. Total health
and social care costs consisted of services that are the main contributors to the cost of care in
nursing homes: hospital inpatient, outpatient, day hospital, accident and emergency, primary
care (calculated as per minute unit costs for general practitioners and practice nurses), com-
munity health care, and ambulatory care. Data on each nursing home resident’s use of health
care (obtained from the CSRI) were multiplied by appropriate unit costs to calculate health
and social care costs for each participant at each time point. Mean differences in costs and 95%
CIs were obtained by non-parametric bootstrapped regression (1,000 repetitions) modelling to
account for non-normal distributions. A multilevel mixed model was used, controlling for site
and age at entry into the study. The adjusted total health and social care cost and outcome
models also included the treatment variable as a random effect at the care home level. Cluster-
ing was accounted for by allowing the model intercept and treatment variable coefficient (i.e.,
treatment effect) to vary by care home.
Sensitivity analysis
As a sensitivity analysis, the same analysis was undertaken for the primary and key secondary
outcomes but using imputed values for people who did not complete the 9-month follow-up.
Logistic regression was used to predict missing variables from the factors and covariates mea-
sured at baseline, using the approach validated in a previous factorial study [9].

Results
Cohort characteristics
In all, 1,006 participants were consented to the study, with 847 individuals randomised to
TAU or WHELD. The majority of participants had moderately severe or severe dementia, and
71% were female. Follow-up assessments were available for 553 participants. Mortality
accounted for the majority of participants who did not complete follow-up assessments. The
descriptive statistics for participants who completed the follow-up were similar to those for the
original population, although numerically marginally more residents receiving TAU com-
pleted the follow-up compared to those receiving the WHELD intervention (66.8% versus
63.6%). The baseline characteristics of the study participants are described in Table 1, and flow
of participants through the study is presented in Fig 1. The trial ended after the last follow-up
assessment of the last participant was completed.
Outcome measures

psychiatric symptoms. The multilevel mixed-effects linear or logistic regression models for pri-
mary and secondary outcome measures are shown in Table 2.
Prescriptions of antipsychotic medications were stable across the study in both treatment
groups, with no reduction in antipsychotic use in the WHELD treatment group compared to
TAU (change in antipsychotic use: WHELD −0.1%, SEM 0.1; TAU −0.2%, SEM 0.1, p = 0.60;
antipsychotic use at 9 months: WHELD versus TAU relative risk 1.06, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.82, p =
0.82). Regarding other secondary outcomes, there were no statistically significant differences
between the WHELD and TAU groups for change in global deterioration (CDR Z score 0.053,
p = 0.96; mean difference 0.01, SEM 0.22), unmet needs (CANE Z score 0.84, p = 0.62; mean
difference 0.04, SEM 0.08), pain (Abbey Pain Scale Z score 1.084, p = 0.27; mean difference
0.33, SEM 0.31), or mood (CSSD Z score 0.036, p = 0.97; mean difference 0.02, SEM 0.48).
There were no significant interaction effects in the primary analysis model, and further analy-
ses accounting for interactions were therefore not undertaken.
The quality of interactions of positive care between care staff and residents with dementia
(QUIS) was collected as a care-home-level assessment in 62 of the participating care homes.
There was a statistically significant 19.7% greater increase in the proportion of positive care
interactions from baseline to 9 months in the WHELD group compared to the TAU group
(SEM 8.94; 95% CI 2.12, 37.16, p = 0.03; Cohen’s D 0.55).
A sub-group analysis was also undertaken comparing the WHELD intervention in people
with mild to moderate (FAST 4–5), moderately severe (FAST 6), and severe (FAST 7) demen-
tia, focusing on the primary and key secondary outcomes (DEMQOL, CMAI, and NPI-NH).
Statistically significant benefits of similar magnitude to the benefits in the overall population
were seen in people with moderately severe dementia for QoL, agitation, and overall neuropsy-
chiatric symptoms, but there were no statistically significant benefits on QoL in the smaller
groups of individuals with mild to moderate or severe dementia. The full results are shown in

 The sensitivity analysis using imputed values confirmed that WHELD conferred a statisti-
cally significant benefit in DEMQOL-Proxy (mean difference 0.06, 1.5 SEM; Z score 2.50, p =
0.015), CMAI (mean difference 0.08, 1.96 SEM; Z score 2.06, p = 0.04), and NPI-NH (mean
difference −2.45, SEM 0.066; Z score 2.64, p = 0.01) outcomes compared to TAU.
Adverse events
A total of 549 serious adverse events were recorded during the period of the trial. The events
were balanced between the 2 treatment groups, with no statistical differences (291 events in
the WHELD group and 258 in the TAU group; Table 4). There was no significant difference
in mortality between the WHELD and TAU group (relative risk 1.08, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.35,
p = 0.50).
Cost analysis
The direct cost of delivering the intervention compared to TAU was £8,627 more per home.
Fifty-three percent (£4,554) of the cost related to WHELD champion time spent in training
and supervision. The remaining costs related to therapist time. Delivery of the intervention to
residents incurred an additional £130 per person per month. The additional cost incurred for
antipsychotic review was £23 per resident, which accounted for WHELD champion time spent
reviewing antipsychotic use in 16% of residents and contacting prescribing physicians. Analy-
sis of service use showed higher healthcare costs unrelated to the intervention in the TAU
group compared to the WHELD intervention group. Participants receiving the intervention
showed a significant health and social care cost advantage. Taking into account the cost of the
intervention and the total health and social care costs, there was a cost advantage for the
WHELD treatment (Table 5).
Discussion
In what is, to our knowledge, the largest RCT conducted of a staff training and non-pharmaco-
logical intervention for people with dementia living in nursing homes, we have demonstrated
that the WHELD intervention confers a statistically significant improvement in QoL over 9

in agitation and neuropsychiatric symptoms were comparable to (agitation) or better than

 saving and used a model that can readily be implemented in nursing homes. Antipsychotic
drug use was stable in both treatment groups across the study, and the WHELD treatment
intervention did not reduce antipsychotic use (baseline frequency was very low).
Despite the importance of QoL, few trials have examined the impact of interventions on
this outcome. In this study, the WHELD intervention conferred a statistically significant im-
provement in QoL over 9 months, building on a previous proof-of-concept study of WHELD.
That study reported a reduction in QoL following antipsychotic review that was mediated by
social interaction within the context of an overall PCC training paradigm for care staff [9]. We
would speculate that the added benefit was probably a reflection of the structured approach to
promoting pleasant activities involving social interaction. The subsequent optimisation of the
WHELD intervention maintained benefit but reduced overall cost, making it a cost-effective
programme for delivery in care homes. A sub-group analysis focusing on people with mild to
moderate, moderately severe, and severe dementia indicated that benefits on QoL were more
robust in people with moderately severe dementia.
Agitation is a frequent and distressing symptom for people with dementia living in nursing
homes [10,11,40]. Benefits from pharmacological treatment with atypical antipsychotics are
limited to modest improvements in aggression [12,13,15], and the significant advantage on the
CMAI for the WHELD intervention compared to control is comparable to the modest treat-
ment advantage for atypical antipsychotics from a meta-analysis of previous RCTs [12,13,15].
In addition, the use of atypical antipsychotics is limited by the significant adverse effects of
these medications in people with dementia [12,13,15]. Recent studies have begun to suggest
that other pharmacological therapies such as citalopram [20] and dextromethorphan [21] may
confer significant benefit for the treatment of agitation, but further studies are needed. There
was also a statistically significant benefit in overall neuropsychiatric symptoms conferred by
the WHELD intervention compared to TAU, suggesting a breadth of benefit beyond just
reducing agitation.
Although comparable to the effect sizes of atypical antipsychotics, the standardised effect
sizes of benefit for WHELD were small in the context of a clinical intervention. The benefits
did however include benefits in QoL, which have not been demonstrated with pharmacologi-
cal interventions. Although there is no established threshold for a clinically meaningful benefit
in QoL, any statistically significant benefit is important given the absence of any benefit in pre-
vious studies. In addition, the intervention was not just delivered to people with clinically sig-
nificant neuropsychiatric symptoms, but conferred benefit amongst a broader population of
people with dementia living in care homes. Whilst the effect sizes would be considered mar-
ginal in terms of a clinically significant benefit, we believe that the benefits to the broader pop-
ulation of people with dementia in care homes make this a meaningful benefit in the quality of
care.
This study is consistent with the evidence base but provides important and novel data
within the literature. Our results also compare favourably to those of the small number of pub-
lished intervention studies that have focused on promoting PCC, none of which have reported
benefits in QoL [6,7]. The findings are particularly favourable when compared with those of
trials of antipsychotic medications, which show only very modest benefits over 12 weeks in the
context of significant harms [41,42]. In addition, the current study shows cost advantages over
usual care, which has not been demonstrated, to our knowledge, with any previous drug or
non-drug intervention.
Elements of the WHELD intervention, such as social interaction and pleasant events, have
previously been demonstrated to improve agitation in modest-sized RCTs [22,23]. Incorporat-
ing them within a coherent framework such as WHELD enables straightforward and afford-
able implementation of these approaches in clinical and care practice.

 Interestingly, there was a low baseline use of antipsychotic medications (<10%) in this
study, reflecting the major changes in clinical practice and the reductions in antipsychotic use
that have been achieved for people with dementia in the last decade. In contrast to our previ-
ous factorial RCT of the WHELD intervention, no significant reduction in antipsychotic use
was achieved, and antipsychotic use was stable in both groups. This is likely attributable to a
combination of the low baseline levels of antipsychotic prescription and the more limited edu-
cation programme for primary care physicians within the current study than in the previous
factorial RCT, and highlights the potential additional value of primary care education pro-
grammes in parallel to care home training.
This study was a robust, well-powered RCT evaluating the sustained impact of combining
PCC and evidence-based non-pharmacological interventions for people with dementia in
nursing homes. The study had good retention of surviving participants compared to most
studies conducted in nursing home settings. The intervention evaluated was pragmatic, fully
manualized, and designed so that it can be easily disseminated and implemented in routine
clinical practice. There were also limitations. Antipsychotic review was based on augmenting
processes within care homes to trigger medical review and did not in this study involve proac-
tive primary care education. In addition, although the study used a well-validated method,
evaluating QoL in people with dementia is challenging and all methods have some limitations.
High mortality rates are usual in studies of frail groups of individuals living in care homes, but
lead to high non-completion rates and present some challenges for data analysis and interpre-
tation. One of the original secondary outcomes was to evaluate the impact of the intervention
on the care home environment. The selected scale focused mainly on the physical building
rather than other aspects of the environment, and the programme management group there-
fore decided to omit this measure at 9-month follow-up as it was unlikely that substantial
building renovations had taken place in any of the participating care homes.
A key issue for future studies is the sustainability of the intervention, particularly with turn-
over of staff, including the WHELD champions. To be sustainable, the WHELD intervention
needs to be firmly embedded within the care home culture, and it will be important for further
research to identify the optimal approach to maintain benefits. As WHELD is largely verbally
based, it will also be important to further evolve interventions more tailored to the needs of
people with more severe dementia.
