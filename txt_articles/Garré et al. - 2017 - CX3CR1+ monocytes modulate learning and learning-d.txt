Abstract
Impaired learning and cognitive function often occurs during systemic infection or inflammation. 
Although activation of the innate immune system has been linked to the behavioral and cognitive 
effects that are associated with infection, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. 
Here we mimicked viral immune activation with poly(I:C), a synthetic analog of double-stranded 
RNA, and longitudinally imaged postsynaptic dendritic spines of layer V pyramidal neurons in the 
mouse primary motor cortex using two-photon microscopy. We found that peripheral immune 
activation caused dendritic spine loss, impairments in learning-dependent dendritic spine 
formation and deficits in multiple learning tasks in mice. These observed synaptic alterations in 
the cortex were mediated by peripheral-monocyte-derived cells and did not require microglial 
function in the central nervous system. Furthermore, activation of CX3CR1highLy6Clow monocytes 
impaired motor learning and learning-related dendritic spine plasticity through tumor necrosis 
factor (TNF)-α-dependent mechanisms. Taken together, our results highlight CX3CR1high 
monocytes and TNF-α as potential therapeutic targets for preventing infection-induced cognitive 
dysfunction.
Activation of the immune system has profound effects on the function of the central nervous 
system (CNS)1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and it is thought to have an important role in schizophrenia6, 
autism-spectrum disorder7 and the neuropsychological impairment associated with 
infectious diseases8. Indeed, changes in mood and cognitive function are frequently 
observed in people who are infected with viruses, such as influenza and HIV, or

 bacteria9, 10, 11, 12, 13. The similarity of behavioral effects that are associated with different 
infectious diseases suggests that immune responses to infectious agents, rather than a 
specific pathogen per se, may have a critical role in cognitive decline. Administration of 
polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) is a widely used model to study virus-associated 
immune activation14. Double-stranded RNA is produced during viral replication15 and 
recognized by the mammalian innate immune system primarily through pathogen 
recognition receptors (PRRs), such as toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)16. The binding of 
poly(I:C) to PRRs leads to the expression of a series of immune mediators (such as type 1 
interferons (IFNs), pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines), a process that efficiently 
mimics the acute phase of viral infection17. Similar to that observed in viral infection, 
peripheral immune stimulation through poly(I:C) has been shown to cause behavioral and 
cognitive impairments in both developing and adult animals18, 19, 20, 21; however, the 
underlying mechanisms remain unclear.
Various host immune cells are involved in innate defense against infection. Monocytes are a 
population of leukocytes that are derived from progenitors in the bone marrow and that 
circulate in the bloodstream22. They develop into macrophages or dendritic cells after 
entering peripheral tissues. In response to infection, monocytes take part in the inflammatory 
response by producing and releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, and 
chemokines in the infected areas23, 24, 25. In the CNS, microglia are the major innate 
immune cells that become activated during systemic infection26. Like monocytes, activated 
microglia produce a number of inflammatory molecules and have been implicated in the 
development of neurodegenerative diseases5. Despite the fact that monocytes and microglia 
are crucial players in innate immunity, which of these populations is involved in the 
alteration of CNS functions during virus-associated immune activation remains unknown. It 
is also unclear how activation of these cells alters neuronal circuits and leads to learning and 
behavioral deficits. Here we show that peripheral immune activation causes deficits in 
learning tasks, synapse loss and a reduction in learning-dependent synapse formation. These 
synaptic and behavioral changes are mediated by CX3CR1high monocytes via TNF-α-
dependent mechanisms.
RESULTS
Systemic immune challenge increases dendritic spine dynamics in the cortex
To investigate how peripheral immune activation affects the brain, we intraperitoneally (i.p.) 
administered poly(I:C) to adolescent (postnatal day (P) 30) transgenic mice that expressed 
yellow fluorescent protein in layer V (L5) pyramidal neurons (Thy1-YFP mice) and 
examined structural changes in the postsynaptic dendritic spines of the primary motor cortex 
using transcranial two-photon microscopy (Fig. 1a)27. After a single injection with either 5 
or 50 mg per kg body weight (mg/kg) poly(I:C), we observed more dendritic spine 
remodeling over 2 d in poly(I:C)-treated mice than in vehicle-treated control mice (Fig. 
1a,b). In control mice, 8.3 ± 0.6% of dendritic spines were eliminated and 7.2 ± 0.7% were 
formed, whereas in mice that were treated with 5 mg/kg poly(I:C), 17.5 ± 1.1% and 14.0 
± 0.9% of dendritic spines were eliminated and formed, respectively. A significant increase 
in spine elimination and formation was also detected 24 h after poly(I:C) injection (Fig. 1c

 and Supplementary Table 1). The rate of spine elimination after poly(I:C) injection was 
higher than that of spine formation (Supplementary Fig. 1), indicating a net loss of spines 
over 1–2 d (Fig. 1d). Four days after poly(I:C) injection, no continued increase in spine 
remodeling was detected relative to that in control mice (Fig. 1b), indicating an acute effect 
of poly(I:C) treatment on spine dynamics. Consistent with previous reports28, 29, we found 
that dendritic spine remodeling was lower in 2-month-old mice than in 1-month-old mice. 
However, similar to what was observed in 1-month-old mice, poly(I:C) injection (5 mg/kg) 
at P60 significantly increased the rates of spine elimination and formation over 2 d (Fig. 
1e,f).
Systemic immune challenge impairs dendritic spine plasticity associated with learning
The remodeling of synaptic connections is important for learning and memory 
formation29, 30, 31, 32, 33. Previous studies have shown that the learning of motor skills causes 
a learning-dependent increase in dendritic spine formation in the motor cortex and that the 
extent of new spine formation correlates with an improvement in the animal’s performance 
after learning29, 32. We next investigated whether poly(I:C) injection similarly altered 
learning-dependent spine remodeling. We trained 1- or 2-month-old mice to run on an 
accelerating rotating rod (which is referred to as a rotarod) and imaged the same dendrites in 
the motor cortex before and after a 2-d period of training (Fig. 2a). Two days after rotarod 
training, we observed a significant reduction in learning-dependent spine formation in 
poly(I:C)-treated mice as compared to that in the age-matched controls (Fig. 2b,c and 
Supplementary Table 1). Conversely, we found a significant increase in spine elimination in 
poly(I:C)-treated mice as compared to that of vehicle-treated controls. Thus, in poly(I:C)-
treated mice the combined result of these modifications is a net loss of spines after learning, 
while vehicle-treated mice exhibit a net gain in spines after learning (Fig. 2d,e). 
Furthermore, although poly(I:C) treatment had no effects on the initial performance of the 
mice in the rotarod task (Fig. 2f,g) or on their body weight (Supplementary Fig. 2) as 
compared to those observed in vehicle-treated mice, poly(I:C) treatment did cause a 
significant reduction in motor performance improvements after a 2-d training period in both 
1- and 2-month-old mice (Fig. 2h,i).
To evaluate the long-term effect of poly(I:C) treatment on learning-related spine remodeling 
and motor performance, we reimaged and tested 2-month-old mice on P67, after a 5-d 
period without further rotarod training (Fig. 2a). We found that of the new spines formed 
during the 2-d training interval (from P60 to P62), fewer persisted at P67 in the poly(I:C)-
treated mice than in the control mice (Fig. 2j). Furthermore, motor performance 
improvement continued to remain lower in the poly(I:C)-treated mice (Fig. 2k). There was a 
significant correlation between the percentage of training-related persistent new spines and 
rotarod performance on P67 (Fig. 2l). We also compared the performance of poly(I:C)- and 
vehicle-treated mice in a ’novel object recognition’ (NOR) test (Supplementary Fig. 3). 
NOR training was performed 24 h after poly(I:C) administration. The training and test 
sessions were separated by either a 1-h or a 24-h interval to examine the short-term and 
long-term memory, respectively, of the mice. Although vehicle-treated control mice showed 
a preference for the novel object during the NOR test, mice that were pretreated with

 poly(I:C) showed no such preference at either 1 h or 24 h after training, indicating impaired 
recognition memory.
CX3CR1+ cells are crucial for poly(I:C)-induced dendritic spine instability
The chemokine receptor CX3CR1 is widely expressed in monocytes and monocyte-derived 
cells in peripheral tissues, and it is exclusively expressed in microglia in the CNS 
parenchyma34. To determine whether the observed effects of poly(I:C) treatment on 
dendritic spine plasticity require the involvement of CX3CR1+ cells, we performed in vivo 
diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR)-mediated cell depletion. Specifically, Cx3cr1CreER mice, 
which express a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase (CreER) under the control of the 
endogenous Cx3cr1 promoter, were crossed with mice harboring the ubiquitous Rosa26-
stop-DTR (R26iDTR) allele, permits DTR expression where Cre is present. For in vivo cell 
depletion, Cx3cr1CreER/+;R26iDTR/+ mice were given tamoxifen for 3 d (P54 to 56) and 
subsequently treated with diphtheria toxin (DT) for 3 d (P57 to 59) (Fig. 3a). We found that 
the majority of CX3CR1+ cells, including peripheral CD11b+ cells and CNS microglia, were 
depleted after the last DT treatment (Fig. 3b–d). One day after the last DT treatment, we 
administered poly(I:C) and examined the rates of spine remodeling in the cortex over the 
next 2 d. Similarly to that seen in wild-type (WT) mice, we found a significant increase in 
spine elimination and formation in control mice that were not depleted for CX3CR1+ cells 
(Cx3cr1CreER/+) at 2 d after the administration of poly(I:C) (Fig. 3e). In contrast, in mice 
that were depleted of CX3CR1+ cells (Cx3cr1CreER/+;R26iDTR/+), poly(I:C) treatment had no 
significant effects on the rates of dendritic spine elimination and formation (Fig. 3f), 
indicating the requirement of CX3CR1+ cells in dendritic spine remodeling in the cortex.
Although CX3CR1 is mostly expressed in cells of the myeloid lineage, a small fraction of T 
cells (which are cells of the lymphoid lineage) may also express CX3CR1 (ref. 34). To 
determine whether T cells were involved in poly(I:C)-induced spine remodeling, we 
examined dendritic spine plasticity in Rag1−/− mice, which are deficient for T cells and B 
cells. We found that administration of poly(I:C) significantly increased the rates of spine 
elimination and formation in Rag1−/− mice, relative to those observed after treatment with 
vehicle only, and that these were comparable to the rates observed in WT mice (Fig. 3g), 
suggesting the role of CX3CR1+ myeloid cells but not of CX3CR1+ T cells in poly(I:C)-
induced synapse alteration.
CNS microglia are not required for poly(I:C)-induced dendritic spine instability
Previous studies have shown that microglia are important for synapse formation and 
elimination under both physiological and pathological conditions35, 36, 37. To determine 
which population of CX3CR1+ cells (central or peripheral) regulates cortical spine plasticity 
during peripheral immune activation, we restricted cell depletion to that of CNS microglia 
by taking advantage of a previously established strategy in which Cx3cr1CreER/+ mice that 
are used ~30 d after tamoxifen administration permit Cre-dependent manipulation of gene 
expression almost exclusively in CNS-resident macrophages, including microglia35, 38. This 
strategy is based on the fact that yolk-sac-derived microglia are a self-renewing population 
with low turnover rates (months to years)39, 40, 41, whereas most peripheral circulating 
CX3CR1+ populations have a high turnover rate (<1 week) and are rapidly replenished

 through bone marrow (BM) precursors42, 43. Consistent with previous studies35, when we 
gave Cx3cr1CreER/+;R26iDTR/+ mice tamoxifen at P30 to P32, and then administered DT ~1 
month later (P57 to P59) (Fig. 4a), we found that CNS microglia were largely depleted, 
whereas the CX3CR1+ population in blood was mostly intact, after the last DT treatment 
(Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 4). Moreover, there was no significant difference in levels 
of the inflammatory cytokine TNF-α in blood and brain (cortex) between control and 
microglia-depleted mice (Supplementary Fig. 4). Notably, when mice depleted of microglia 
were challenged with poly(I:C), we found a significant increase in dendritic spine 
elimination and formation in the cortex after 2 d (Fig. 4c). The increase in spine turnover 
after poly(I:C) treatment was comparable to that observed in nondepleted control mice with 
intact CNS microglia, indicating that systemic immune challenge alters spine dynamics in 
the cortex in the absence of microglia. Consistent with this finding, we found no 
morphological signs of microglial activation in the motor cortex at 24 h after poly(I:C) 
administration (Supplementary Fig. 5).
CX3CR1+ monocytes mediate poly(I:C)-induced synaptic and learning deficits
To further establish the function of peripheral CX3CR1+ monocytes on dendritic spine 
remodeling during systemic immune challenge, we transplanted BM cells obtained from 
Cx3cr1CreER/+;R26iDTR/+ mice into irradiated WT recipients (referred to as 
Cx3cr1CreER/+;R26iDTR/+→WT chimeras) to generate chimeric mice that express 
Cx3cr1CreER/+;R26iDTR/+ only in peripheral tissues. One month after BM reconstitution, 
mice were given tamoxifen and subsequently treated with DT (Fig. 4d). Flow cytometry 
analysis revealed a substantial reduction in the number of CX3CR1+CD11b+ cells in the 
blood and liver tissues of the Cx3cr1CreER/+;R26iDTR/+→WT chimeras as compared to that 
in their control counterparts that received BM cells from Cx3cr1CreER/+ mice 
(Cx3cr1CreER/+→WT chimeras), indicating a reduction of CX3CR1+ monocytes and 
monocyte-derived cells. In contrast, DT treatment had no effect on the number of CNS 
microglia in the cortex of the Cx3cr1CreER/+;R26iDTR/+→WT chimeras (Fig. 4e and 
Supplementary Fig. 6).
Next we examined the effect of poly(I:C) treatment on the baseline and learning-induced 
remodeling of dendritic spines in the motor cortex. Poly(I:C) treatment significantly 
increased the baseline spine elimination and formation rates in nondepleted control mice 
(Fig. 4f), whereas poly(I:C) treatment had no significant effects on the baseline rates of 
spine turnover in mice that were depleted of CX3CR1+ monocytes (Fig. 4g). Furthermore, in 
contrast to control mice, which showed impaired learning-dependent spine remodeling and a 
reduction in the total number of spines, poly(I:C) treatment caused no changes in motor-
learning-dependent spine remodeling or in total spine number in chimeras in which 
CX3CR1+ monocytes were depleted (Fig. 4h–k and Supplementary Fig. 7). An improvement 
in performance after rotarod motor learning was also not impaired in these mice after 
poly(I:C) administration (Fig. 4l–o). Taken together, these results indicate that the effect of 
systemic immune challenge on learning and learning-dependent dendritic spine remodeling 
is mainly mediated by peripheral CX3CR1+ monocytes.

 To further investigate the role of monocytes in poly(I:C)-induced dendritic spine alteration, 
we collected leukocytes from blood and spleen tissues and magnetically sorted them on the 
basis of the cell surface expression of CD11b, a marker for myeloid cells (including 
monocytes). Mice that were depleted of CX3CR1+ cells (in both the CNS and periphery) 
were injected with various amounts of CD11b-sorted cells. We found that poly(I:C) 
treatment significantly increased spine elimination and formation in mice that were injected 
with 2 × 106 CD11b-sorted cells, as compared to that in vehicle-treated mice 
(Supplementary Fig. 8). The rates of spine elimination and formation after poly(I:C) 
administration were significantly lower in mice that were adoptively transferred with a lower 
number (0.5 × 106) of CD11b-sorted cells than in those that were adoptively transferred with 
2 × 106 CD11b-sorted cells. We did not find changes in spine turnover in mice that were 
injected with the fraction of cells that did not express CD11b.
CX3CR1high monocytes are required for poly(I:C)-induced synaptic and learning deficits
Previous work has identified that two distinct subsets of peripheral blood monocytes exist in 
mice, based on the level of CX3CR1 expression (CX3CR1low and CX3CR1high)44. When we 
examined the expression of Ly6C, a marker for inflammatory monocytes, in CX3CR1+ cells, 
we found that systemic or peripheral depletion of CX3CR1+ cells substantially reduced the 
number of CX3CR1highLy6Clow monocytes in the blood, whereas CX3CR1lowLy6Chigh 
monocytes were not affected (Supplementary Fig. 9). These results suggest that 
CX3CR1highLy6Clow monocytes, a population of monocytes that patrol blood vessels24, are 
essential for poly(I:C)-induced cortical changes.
To test the role of CX3CR1high monocytes in poly(I:C)-induced synaptic deficits, we took 
advantage of the fact that CX3CR1 deficiency leads to a substantial reduction of 
CX3CR1high monocytes45, and generated Cx3cr1−/−→WT chimeric mice, which have a 
deficiency of CX3CR1 in peripheral leukocytes (Fig. 5a). In Cx3cr1−/−→WT mice, we 
found that poly(I:C) administration had no significant effects on the baseline rates of 
dendritic spine elimination and formation in the motor cortex (Fig. 5b,c). Moreover, motor 
learning-induced spine formation and elimination were not affected by the administration of 
poly(I:C) before the training (Fig. 5d,e). As a result, there were no changes in total spine 
number after poly(I:C) administration in Cx3cr1−/−→WT mice (Fig. 5f,g). Furthermore, 
administration of poly(I:C) in Cx3cr1−/−→WT chimeric mice had no significant effects on 
baseline performance in the rotarod test and on performance improvement after training, as 
compared to that observed after treatment with vehicle (Fig. 5h–k). Thus, systemic immune 
challenge impairs dendritic spine plasticity and learning through the involvement of 
CX3CR1high monocytes.
CX3CR1high monocytes contribute to increased TNF-α levels in the cortex
CX3CR1 signaling in CX3CR1high monocytes has been linked to the production of TNF-α 
and chemokines24. To explore the molecular mechanisms that mediate the effects of 
CX3CR1high monocytes on dendritic spine plasticity, we measured the protein levels of pro-
inflammatory cytokines at various time points after poly(I:C) injection. In WT mice, 
poly(I:C) treatment caused a transient increase in cytokine production in the peripheral 
circulation (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Fig. 10). Plasma levels of TNF-α, interleukin (IL)-6,

 IL-1β and IFN-β were substantially increased at 3 h after poly(I:C) injection, relative to 
those in vehicle-injected mice (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Fig. 10). Notably, we found a 
significant increase in TNF-α levels in the cortex at 3–24 h after poly(I:C) injection (Fig. 6b 
and Supplementary Fig. 11), whereas there were no changes in IL-6 and IL-1β levels 
(Supplementary Fig. 10); the amount of IFN-β in the cortex was below that detectable by the 
ELISA.
To determine whether CX3CR1high monocytes are required for the poly(I:C)-induced 
increase in TNF-α levels in the cortex, we performed ELISA measurements in mice that 
were depleted of either CNS microglia or peripheral monocytes (Supplementary Fig. 12). 
We found that there were significantly more amounts of TNF-α in the cortex of mice that 
were depleted of microglia but that had an intact blood monocyte population at 24 h after 
poly(I:C) administration than in mice that were treated with vehicle. In contrast, in mice that 
were depleted of CX3CR1+ monocytes but that had intact CNS microglia, poly(I:C) 
treatment had no significant effect on the TNF-α levels in the cortex, relative to the levels 
observed in the vehicle-treated controls. Together with the finding that mice depleted of 
CX3CR1+ monocytes had reduced numbers of CX3CR1highLy6Clow blood monocytes 
(Supplementary Fig. 9), these results suggest that CX3CR1high monocytes are required for 
the increase in brain TNF-α levels during systemic immune challenge.
TNFα mediates poly(I:C)-induced synaptic and learning deficits
Previous studies have shown that TNF-α has an important role in synapse 
plasticity46, 47, 48, 49. Given our findings that CX3CR1high monocytes are required for 
poly(I:C)-induced spine remodeling and increased TNF-α levels in the cortex, we 
hypothesized that the effect of systemic immune challenge on learning and learning-
dependent synapse plasticity are mediated by this monocyte subset through TNF-α 
signaling. In Tnf−/− mice (which do not produce TNF-α), we found that poly(I:C) 
administration had no significant effects on the rates of dendritic spine elimination and 
formation over 2 d, whereas intravenous administration of exogenous TNF-α significantly 
increased the rates of spine elimination and formation (Fig. 6c). Furthermore, administration 
of the dominant-negative form of TNF-α (hereafter referred to as DN-TNF), which binds to 
soluble TNF-α, abolished poly(I:C)-induced increase in baseline spine turnover in WT mice 
(Fig. 6d).
Several lines of evidence have suggested that systemic inflammation or increased amounts 
of TNF-α may change the permeability of the blood–brain barrier (BBB)50. To control for 
the potential effects of BBB disruption on spine remodeling, we administered poly(I:C) to 
mice that were treated with SB-3CT, which protects the BBB by inhibiting matrix 
metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9)51 (Supplementary Fig. 13), and found that treatment with 
poly(I:C) substantially increased spine remodeling in SB-3CT-treated mice. Furthermore, 
there were no changes in the number of CD45highCD11b+ cells in the cortex 2 d after 
poly(I:C) administration (Supplementary Fig. 14). Taken together, these results suggest that 
the deleterious effects of poly (I:C) on spine remodeling are mediated by increased TNF-α 
production, rather than due to BBB disruption and subsequent entry of blood monocytes into 
the cortex.

 To investigate whether diminishing TNF-α production by monocytes could protect the mice 
from synaptic and learning impairments, we generated Tnf−/−→WT chimeras that were 
unable to produce TNF-α in leukocytes. One month after BM transplantation, we 
administered poly(I:C) to these mice and examined baseline spine turnover, motor-learning-
dependent spine plasticity, as well as performance improvement after motor training (Fig. 
6e). We found that poly(I:C) treatment had no significant effects on the rates of spine 
elimination and formation under both baseline (Fig. 6f) and motor-learning conditions (Fig. 
6g,h and Supplementary Fig. 15) in Tnf−/−→WT mice. Furthermore, mice that were 
deficient for TNF-α production by leukocytes did not show motor learning deficits after 
poly(I:C) administration (Fig. 6i,j). As a control, we administered poly(I:C) to Il6−/−→WT 
chimeras, in which IL-6 production by leukocytes was abolished, and examined spine 
plasticity in the cortex. We found a marked increase of spine elimination and formation after 
2 d in poly(I:C)-treated mice as compared to that in vehicle-treated controls (Supplementary 
Fig. 16). The relative increase in spine turnover after poly(I:C) administration was 
comparable between Il6−/−→WT chimeras and WT mice, suggesting that increased amounts 
of IL-6 in the serum are not required for synaptic alteration in the cortex.
DISCUSSION
Despite the compelling evidence for an association between immune activation and 
cognitive disorders4,5,6,7, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here we identified an 
important role of CX3CR1+ monocytes and TNF-α in the modulation of learning-dependent 
synapse structural plasticity during peripheral immune activation (Supplementary Fig. 17). 
Specifically, we showed that the initiation of peripheral innate immunity with a viral 
mimetic increased postsynaptic dendritic spine turnover in the mouse motor cortex and 
decreased the dendritic spine formation associated with motor learning. These synaptic 
changes are prevented by the in vivo ablation of peripheral monocytes, but not by depletion 
of brain-resident microglial cells. By using BM chimeric mice and transgenic mice, we 
further showed that both synaptic and learning impairments require CX3CR1high blood 
monocytes and TNF-α production.
Because most dendritic spines in the adult cortex persist throughout life28,29, the loss of 
dendritic spines after immune challenge is likely detrimental to the functions of synaptic 
networks. Previous studies have shown that motor-learning-dependent synapse formation 
strongly correlates with improvements in performance after learning29,32. Consistent with 
these studies, we observed a marked decrease in performance improvement after a period of 
rotarod learning in mice with impaired spine formation. Additionally, we observed that 
peripheral immune activation impaired the mouse’s short- and long-term memory in NOR 
tasks. These results in mice resonate with clinical observations showing that patients with 
acute or chronic infectious diseases often have weaker performance on motor skills and 
experience memory decline relative to that in uninfected individuals 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. 
Furthermore, because immune activation is involved in many neuropsychiatric and 
neurological diseases5, 6, 7, the synaptic abnormalities observed in our studies may also 
occur under these medical conditions and contribute to cognitive deficits.

 Our findings underscore the importance of CX3CR1high monocytes for synaptic deficits and 
learning impairment during peripheral immune activation. This was demonstrated by a series 
of in vivo cell-depletion experiments using Cx3cr1CreER/+;R26iDTR/+ mice. First, immune-
challenge-induced synaptic alteration could be prevented by the depletion of the entire 
CX3CR1+ population or by the ablation of CX3CR1high blood monocytes, but not by the 
removal of CNS microglia. Second, adoptive transfer of CD11b+ cells, which include 
monocytes, reconstituted the phenotype in Cx3cr1CreER/+;R26iDTR/+ mice that were depleted 
of the entire CX3CR1+ population. Third, consistent with the finding that CX3CR1-deficient 
mice have a reduced number of Gr1low (CX3CR1high) monocytes45, mice with CX3CR1 
deficiency in peripheral leukocytes did not show synaptic and learning deficits during 
immune activation, further suggesting that CX3CR1high monocytes are essential for 
peripheral-immune-challenge-induced cortical changes.
CX3CR1 is also expressed by human monocytes44, in which CX3CR1low cells correspond to 
classical CD14+CD16− monocytes, whereas nonclassical human CD14lowCD16+ monocytes 
resemble mouse CX3CR1highLy6Clow blood-resident monocytes52. It has been shown that 
CD14low human monocytes patrol blood vessels in steady state and produce high amounts of 
TNFα and IL-1β in response to infection by the measles virus or herpes simplex virus 
(HSV-1) (ref. 52). In patients with an HIV infection, the CD16+ monocyte subset 
preferentially harbors the virus53 and activation of this subset is associated with 
neurocognitive impairment after viral infection54,55. Future studies of this monocytes 
population in humans will help explain their contribution to the cognitive decline associated 
with viral infection that is observed.
Our study links the activation of CX3CR1high monocytes to synaptic and learning deficits 
via TNF-α-dependent mechanisms. TNF-α can be produced by peripheral monocytes and 
endothelial cells, as well as by glia and neurons in the brain. Our studies strongly suggest 
that monocyte-dependent TNF-α production is a causative event in the initiation of dendritic 
spine alteration in the cortex (Supplementary Note 1). TNF-α may affect synaptic plasticity 
directly through neuronally expressed TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1)47,48,49 and/or indirectly 
through astrocyte–neuron signaling56 (Supplementary Note 2). Future use of genetic 
approaches to manipulate TNF signaling in specific cell types is needed to better understand 
how TNFα alters dendritic spine remodeling.
In summary, our present findings provide an important mechanism by which innate immune 
responses modulate the synapse structural plasticity associated with learning, which is likely 
relevant to cognitive disturbances that are associated with systemic infectious states, such as 
HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, viral sepsis and meningitis. Targeting the human 
correlates of mouse CX3CR1highLy6Clow monocytes and preventing the production of TNF-
α and synaptic deficits may be a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent cognitive 
disturbances in these medical conditions.

 Methods
Mice
Thy1-YFP-H mice (stock 003782)57, which express yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) in L5 
pyramidal neurons, Rosa26-stop-DTR mice (stock 007900)58, which express a conditional 
DTR-encoding allele in the ROSA locus, Rag1−/− mice (stock 002216)59, Tnf−/− mice (stock 
005540)60, Il6−/− mice (stock 002650) and B6 CD45.1 mice (stock 002014) were purchased 
from the Jackson Laboratory. Cx3cr1CreER mice35 were obtained from the laboratory of 
Wen-Biao Gan (New York University). Cx3cr1GFP mice34 were obtained from the laboratory 
of Dan Littman (New York University). To image dendritic spine plasticity in 
Cx3cr1CreER/+;R26iDTR/+ and Tnf−/− mice, these mice were crossed to Thy1-YFP-H mice. 
For systemic immune challenge, mice were administered poly(I:C) (Sigma P1530; by i.p. 
injection) that was dissolved in DPBS. Mice were group-housed in temperature-controlled 
rooms on a 12-h light–dark cycle and were randomly assigned to different treatment groups. 
The group size was determined based on previous studies using the same 
methodologies28,29,30,31,32. Both male and female mice were used. All mice were 
maintained at the NYU Skirball Institute specific-pathogen-free animal facility and handled 
in accordance with the institutional guidelines for animal care and use.
In vivo cell depletion
For in vivo cell depletion, Cx3cr1CreER/+ mice were used as non-depleted control, and 
Cx3cr1CreER/+:R26iDTR/+ mice were used for cell depletion. All mice (control and cell-
depleted mice) were given both tamoxifen and diphtheria toxin. To induce CreER 
recombination, mice were administered tamoxifen (0.35 mg/g per day; oral gavage) 
dissolved in corn oil (Sigma) for 3 consecutive days. For cell depletion, diphtheria toxin 
(Sigma) was diluted in DPBS and 1 µg of toxin was given i.p. to adult mice (14–18 g body 
weight) for three consecutive days.
In vivo transcranial two-photon imaging
Dendritic spines in the cortex were imaged through a thinned-skull window using a two-
photon microscope27. Briefly, surgical anesthesia was achieved using an intraperitoneal 
injection of 100 mg/kg ketamine and 15 mg/kg xylazine. A midline scalp incision exposed 
the skull. The area to be imaged was identified based on stereotaxic coordinates for the 
primary motor cortex (1 mm lateral from midline, 0.5 mm posterior from bregma). The head 
was immobilized, and a cranial window was created by thinning a circular area (~200 µm in 
diameter) of the skull to approximately 20 µm in thickness by using a high-speed drill and/or 
a microsurgical blade. Upon completion of the skull thinning, the animal was placed under a 
two-photon microscope while still under anesthesia. Two-photon laser was tuned to 920 nm. 
All experiments were performed using a 1.1 NA 60× objective immersed in artificial 
cerebrospinal fluid to obtain high-magnification (66.7 µm × 66.7 µm; 512 × 512 pixels; 0.75 
µm step) images for dendritic spine analysis. After imaging, the scalp was sutured with 6–0 
silk and the animal was returned to the home cage until the next viewing.

 Imaging data analysis
Analysis of dendritic spine plasticity was performed using the NIH ImageJ software as 
described previously28,29. Briefly, for each dendritic segment, filopodia were identified as 
long, thin protrusions without bulbous heads and the remaining protrusions were classified 
as spines. Images of the same dendritic segments identified from two views were compared. 
Spines were considered stable if they were present in both views, eliminated if they were 
present in the 1st view but not in the 2nd view or newly formed if they were present in the 2nd 
view but not in the 1st view. The elimination and formation rates were measured as the 
number of spines eliminated or formed in the 2nd view divided by the number of spines 
existing in the 1st view. In some experiments (Fig. 2), after identification of new spines 
formed in the 2nd view, the persistence of new spines was determined by examining the 
image obtained from the 3rd view. The percentage of persistent new spines was measured as 
the number of new spines that were present in both 2nd and 3rd view, divided by the number 
of spines existing in the 1st view. For the analysis of spine morphology (Supplementary Fig. 
1), eliminated or newly formed spines were classified into three categories: mushroom 
spines (bulbous head; neck length ≤ head diameter), thin spines (bulbous head; neck length 
> head diameter) and stubby spines (no visible neck).
To analyze microglial morphology, z-projections of confocal imaging stacks (100 µm × 100 
µm × 15 µm) were generated using ImageJ software61. The percentage of area covered by 
microglia was calculated by making a binary image (Gray value 0 for background and 255 
for GFP-labeled microglia) from the z-projection and counting the number of white pixels 
within the area. Investigators were blinded to experimental condition when performing data 
analysis.
Behavioral assays
All behavioral experiments were performed in double-blind fashion. Rotarod motor training 
was performed using an EZRod system. Animals were placed on a motorized rod (30 mm in 
diameter) in the test chamber (44.5 cm × 14 cm × 51 cm dimensions). The rod stayed 
stationary for 30 sec, and then the rotation speed linearly increased from 0 to 80 r. p. m. over 
the course of 2 min. The latency to fall and rotation speed were recorded when the animal 
was unable to keep up with the increasing speed. Rotarod training/testing was conducted in 
three 20-trial sessions per day over two consecutive days. Mice were tested again in two 20-
trial sessions after 7 days. Performance was calculated as the average speed animals 
achieved during each day. The first training session started 24 h after vehicle or poly(I:C) 
injection.
For novel object recognition, mice were tested in custom-built opaque plexiglass boxes (25 
cm × 25 cm × 25 cm). Behavior was videotaped using standard webcams and images were 
analyzed with Quicktime software (Apple). Mice were handled by the same researcher 2 
min per day for 3 consecutive days and then habituated to the testing environment for 30 min 
with no objects in the chamber. Twenty four hours after the habituation, mice were placed 
into testing environment with two identical sample objects (the familiar object) placed in 
opposite corners for 10 min. Mice were removed and returned to their home cages. One or 
twenty four hours later, mice were returned to the testing environment for 5 min where one

 of the sample objects was replaced by a novel object, which differs from the familiar object 
in the shape and texture. Testing session was scored by an experienced observer who was 
blinded to the experimental condition. Interaction with the familiar or novel object was 
considered to be the exploration time in which the animal spent with its head and nose 
oriented toward and within 2 cm of the object. Different types of interactions such as the 
animal accidentally touching, sitting or standing on the object were not considered 
exploratory activity. Discrimination ratio was calculated as the time spent exploring the 
novel object divided by the total time spent with both novel and familiar objects.
Cell isolation and flow cytometry
Mice were deeply anesthetized, and blood was collected from the retro-orbital vein. Mice 
were perfused with 25 ml of Ca2+/Mg2+-free DPBS (Sigma). Brain and liver were removed 
and placed in DPBS with 2% FCS. Single-cell suspensions from blood, liver and cortex 
were prepared. The liver was mechanically dissociated and filtered through 70-μm cell 
strainer. Cells were suspended in 40% Percoll layered over 80% Percoll for density 
centrifugation (2,000 r.p.m., 30 min). Enriched cells were collected from the interphase. The 
cortex was minced with scissors and incubated with 300 U of collagenase D (Roche, 
11088858001) at 37 °C for 30 min. Collagenase was inactivated by adding 12.5 mM EDTA 
for an additional 5-min incubation at 37 °C. Digested material was passed through a 70-μM 
cell strainer, followed by a centrifugation at 2,000 r.p.m. in a continuous 38% Percoll 
gradient. Cell pellets were resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS containing 0.5% BSA, 1 mM 
EDTA and 0.05% sodium azide), and nonspecific binding to FC receptors was blocked by 
incubation with a CD16- and CD32-specific antibody (BioXcell, 2.4G2, 2.5 μg/ml) for 15 
min. Cells were washed and stained with antibodies to the following proteins: CD11b 
(BioLegend, 101216, 1:400), CD45 (BioLegend, 103128, 1:200), CD45.1 (clone A20, 
1:200), CD45.2 (clone 104, 1:200), Ly6C (BioLegend, 128011, 1:1,000) and a lineage-
specific antibody cocktail (LIN: CD19 (BioLegend, 152407, 1:200), CD3 (BioLegend, 
100307, 1:200), TCR-β chain (BioLegend, 109207, 1:200)). Flow cytometry was performed 
on an LSRII (BD) and analyzed with FlowJo v. 8.7 (Treestar).
BM chimera generation
One-month-old recipient mice (10–12 g) were exposed to 1,200 rad of whole-body gamma 
irradiation in 2 sessions of 7.5 min, 3 h apart. Head protection was used in separate cohorts 
of recipient mice during irradiation to exclude the potential artifacts caused by cranial 
irradiation. Recipient mice were injected with donor BM cells (3–5 × 106 cells) through the 
retro-orbital venous sinus 1–3 h after the second session of irradiation. Donor BM cells were 
extracted from the femur of donor mice and passed through a 70-µm cell strainer. Animals’ 
body weight was monitored every other day. For the first 2 weeks after irradiation, animals’ 
drinking water was supplemented with 2 mg/ml sulfamethoxazole and 0.4 mg/ml 
trimethoprim. Four to six weeks after BM reconstitution, most of BM chimeric mice (from 
all genotypes tested) were healthy (normal body weight, gait and absence of clasping reflex) 
and exhibited normal motor function and a preference for the novel object in the NOR test. 
Flow cytometry analysis from blood samples of congenic (CD45.1→CD45.2) chimeras 
confirmed that 75 ± 10 % (n = 2 mice) of circulating leukocytes were of donor origin 4–6 
weeks after BM reconstitution.

 Previous study suggests that cranial irradiation may harm blood-brain barrier and cause 
recruitment of BM cells into the CNS parenchyma39,62. To examine the possibility that BM 
cells may be recruited into the motor cortex of irradiated mice, we generated chimeric mice 
with Cx3cr1GFP/+ BM and examined the mouse cortex using 2-photon microscopy. One 
month after BM transplantation, we did not observe GFP-expressing cells in the parenchyma 
of the motor cortex, indicating limited parenchymal recruitment of BM cells into the cortex 
during the time window relevant to the current study. Moreover, we found no significant 
differences in dendritic spine plasticity and motor performance between head-protected 
chimeric animals and chimeras without head protection during irradiation (Supplementary 
Figs. 7 and 15).
Magnetic cell sorting
CD11b+ cells were harvested from the blood and spleen by magnetic cell sorting. Blood was 
collected from anesthetized mice through the retro-orbital vein using heparinized capillary 
tubes and then diluted in DPBS (1:1 vol/vol). Leukocytes were isolated by centrifugation in 
an iso-osmotic polysucrose and diatrizoate solution (lymphocyte separation medium; 
Corning) at 300g for 30 min at 4 °C. For the isolation of splenocytes, spleens from 
anesthetized mice were dissected and smashed in magnetic cell sorting (MACS) buffer 
containing 0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA in PBS, pH 7.2, at 4 °C. The cell suspension was 
passed through a 70-μm cell strainer, centrifuged at 300g for 10 min at 4 °C, resuspended in 
ACK lysis buffer (Lonza) for 3 min and then washed in MACS buffer. Blood and spleen 
leukocytes were resuspended in 400 μl of MACS buffer and incubated with 40 μl of CD11b 
Microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) for 15 min at 4 °C. Magnetic separation was performed in 
appropriate MACS separators. Cell viability was evaluated by a trypan blue exclusion assay, 
in which cells were incubated in 0.4% trypan blue in isotonic salt solution and evaluated in a 
hemocytometer. Sorted CD11b+ cells were transferred to the recipient mice through the 
retro-orbital vein.
Immunohistochemistry
Mice were deeply anesthetized and perfused with 20 ml Ca2+/Mg2+-free DPBS. The brain 
was removed and fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C. The tissue was rinsed 
three times with PBS and sectioned at 200 μm with a Leica vibratome (VT 1000 S). Sections 
were permeabilized in 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for at least 3 h and blocked with a solution 
containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5% normal goat serum for 1 h. Sections were incubated 
overnight with primary antibodies: rabbit anti-Iba1 (Wako 019-19741, 1:300), chicken anti-
GFAP (Millipore AB5541, 1:200), mouse anti-NeuN (Millipore MAB377, 1:200), or rat 
anti-TNF-α (Biolegend 506302, 1:50). Sections were then washed three times with 0.05% 
Tween-20 in PBS and then incubated for 1 h with the appropriate secondary antibodies: 
Alexa-Fluor-405-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Abcam 175671); Alexa-Fluor-647-
conjugated goat anti-rabbit-IgG (Invitrogen A32733) or goat anti-mouse-IgG (Invitrogen 
A21236). Sections were washed as described before, incubated with or without DAPI (1 
ng/ml) for 10 min, washed and mounted in MoWiol 4–88/glycerol for imaging. For the 
double staining of TNF-α and the neuronal marker NeuN, sections were pre-treated with 
sodium citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, 0.05% Tween 20, pH, 5.8) and heated at 100°C

 for 3 min before proceeding with the procedure described above. Confocal images were 
obtained on a Zeiss 700 confocal microscope.
ELISA
Whole blood was collected by ventricular puncture while mice were under deep anesthesia. 
Blood samples were centrifuged at 1400 g for 10 min to generate plasma fractions. Brain 
samples were prepared in separate experiments, in which mice were perfused with 25 ml of 
Ca2+/Mg2+-free DPBS to remove remaining blood. CNS tissues were harvested and 
disrupted by sonication in NP-40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH=7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% 
NP-40, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors (Thermo 
Scientific). The homogenized material was centrifuged at 20,000 g for 15 min and the 
cleared supernatant was collected for analysis. Total protein levels in CNS homogenates 
were determined by BCA assay (Pierce). TNFα, IL-6 and IL-1β protein levels were 
measured using the Mouse Platinum ELISA kit (eBioscience), and IFNβ was measured 
using the Mouse IFNβ ELISA kit (Life Technologies). Samples were processed according to 
the manufacturer’s instructions.
Statistics
Prism software (GraphPad 6.0, La Jolla, CA) was used to conduct the statistical analysis. 
Summary data were presented as mean ± s.e.m. Tests for differences between two 
populations were performed using Mann-Whitney test or Wilcoxon test. Multiple group 
comparison was performed with nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test or one-way ANOVA 
followed by a Bonferroni's post hoc test as specified in the figure legends. No data points 
were excluded from the statistical analysis, and variance was similar between groups being 
statistically compared. Significant levels were set at P < 0.05.
