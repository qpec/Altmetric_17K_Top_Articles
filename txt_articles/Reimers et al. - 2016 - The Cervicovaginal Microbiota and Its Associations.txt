Background.
Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is characterized by low abundance of Lactobacillus species, high pH, and immune cell
infiltration and has been associated with an increased risk of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. We molecularly assessed
the cervicovaginal microbiota over time in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–infected and HIV-uninfected women to more
comprehensively study the HPV-microbiota relationship, controlling for immune status.
Methods.
16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing and HPV DNA testing were conducted annually in serial
cervicovaginal lavage specimens obtained over 8–10 years from African American women from Chicago, of whom 22 were HIV
uninfected, 22 were HIV infected with a stable CD4+ T-cell count of > 500 cells/mm3, and 20 were HIV infected with progressive
immunosuppression. Vaginal pH was serially measured.
Results.
The relative abundances of Lactobacillus crispatus and other Lactobacillus species were inversely associated with vaginal
pH (all P < .001). High (vs low) L. crispatus relative abundance was associated with decreased HPV detection (odds ratio, 0.48; 95%
confidence interval, .24–.96; Ptrend = .03) after adjustment for repeated observation and multiple covariates, including pH and study
group. However, there were no associations between HPV and the relative abundance of Lactobacillus species as a group, nor with
Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus iners, and Lactobacillus jensenii individually.
Conclusions.
L. crispatus may have a beneficial effect on the burden of HPV in both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women
(independent of pH).

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the principal etiolog-
ic agent in the development of cervical precancer and cancer
[1]. Women with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infec-
tion are at high risk of HPV infection, as well as cervical disease
[2],and these risks increase with diminishing CD4+ T-cell count
[3–5]. A prior study by our group also showed that, in both
HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women, the prevalence of
HPV is high among those with bacterial vaginosis (BV) [6], a
dysbiosis often characterized by a low abundance of Lactobacil-
lus species, high pH, and immune cell infiltration. Interestingly,
while HPV infection was associated with both BV as well as
HIV in that earlier study, these relationships were independent
of one another [6], as BV itself was not more common in
HIV-infected than in HIV-uninfected women.
Lactobacillus species produce lactic acid, and vaginal pH sig-
nificantly decreases as the relative abundance (RA) of Lactoba-
cillus species (as a group) increases [7]. Some studies have also
reported that vaginal bacterial communities specifically domi-
nated by Lactobacillus crispatus are associated with lower pH
than those dominated by other lactobacilli [8]. This may be
important because vaginal pH has been associated with HPV
detection. For example, one frequently cited article found a
10%–20% lower risk of HPV detection in subjects with a vaginal
pH a < 5.0 than in those with a vaginal pH of ≥ 5.0 [9]. It is
therefore noteworthy that a recent study found no relation of
vaginal pH levels with HIV status [7], a result consistent with
our earlier report showing no relation of HIV seropositivity
with BV (discussed above).
Overall, while the impact of HIV on BV risk may be limited,
BV has been shown to increase local expression and transmis-
sion of HIV and might increase risks of certain other sexually
transmitted infections (STIs) [6, 10–12]. We hypothesized that

 the commonality that relates both BV and vaginal pH to HPV
infection (independent of HIV) is the RA of certain Lactobacil-
lus species, most notably L. crispatus. Consistent with this, a
high RA of L. crispatus has been associated with reduced risks
of BV and STIs in several studies [8, 12–14]. However, data
regarding the cervicovaginal microbiota and its specific relation
with HPV infection are limited. In particular, there is a paucity
of longitudinal studies of the cervicovaginal microbiota and
HPV [15], and even among cross-sectional studies few have
involved HIV-infected women. Last, despite considerable spec-
ulation that cervicovaginal pH may mediate the effects of the
microbiota on HPV infection, no studies have, to our knowl-
edge, assessed whether statistical control for pH weakens the
HPV-microbiota association, which would be expected if pH
was part of the causal pathway.
Therefore, in the current investigation, we combined data
from 2 independently conducted ancillary studies in the Wom-
en’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) cohort: a study involving
serial microbiota and vaginal pH testing and a longitudinal
study of cervicovaginal HPV detection.
METHODS
WIHS Background
The WIHS is an ongoing multiinstitutional cohort investigation
of the natural history and pathogenesis of HIV/AIDS in women
[16]. Briefly, HIV-infected and at-risk HIV-uninfected women
were enrolled through similar sources at 6 sites (Bronx, NY;
Brooklyn, NY; Chicago, IL; Los Angeles, CA; San Francisco,
CA; and Washington, DC). Enrollment was conducted in
1994–1995 (2054 HIV-infected women and 569 HIV-uninfect-
ed women) and again in 2001–2002 (737 HIV-infected women
and 406 HIV-uninfected women). Participants undergo a semi-
annual clinical visit that involves performance of a Papanico-
laou test and collection of a cervicovaginal lavage (CVL)
specimen. Written informed consent was obtained from all par-
ticipants, and the study was approved by each local institutional
review board.
WIHS Substudy Population
As described previously [10], women included in the micro-
biome substudy were selected from among premenopausal
African American participants at the Chicago WIHS site,
with at least 8 years of observation and a minimum of 6 annual
CVL specimens, with further selection based on their HIV sta-
tus and CD4+ T-cell count over time. Specifically, 3 study
groups were defined: HIV-uninfected women (n=22); HIV-
infected women with rapidly progressive immunosuppression,
defined as an initial CD4+ T-cell count of >500 cells/mm3 fol-
lowed by a drop to <200 cells/mm3, with a poor immunologic
response to therapy (<100 cells/mm3 increase over a year) dur-
ing the observation period (n = 20); and HIV-infected women
with a stable immune status, defined as a CD4+ T-cell count
of >500 cells/mm3 throughout the observation period, who
were frequency matched at the index visit to those with rapidly
progressive immunosuppression (n = 22). Matching was con-
ducted using MatchIt, based in the R programming language
and statistical software [17, 18]. The matching criteria included
age (<40 years, 40–49, and >50 years), cigarette smoking, sexual
activity (frequency and number of partners), and male condom
use. The exclusion criteria were current laboratory detection of
gonorrhea, syphilis, trichomoniasis, or chlamydial infection at
the index visit or exchange of sex for drugs or money at >5 visits
during the observation period. These inclusion/exclusions
criteria were intended to limit the factors that needed to be
addressed while studying the original scientific question, name-
ly, the influence of HIV on the cervicovaginal microbiota. In a
separate independently conducted study, the presence of HPV
DNA in CVLs was longitudinally assessed semiannually in all
WIHS women with available specimens over a similar period
of 8–10 years or more [5].
Laboratory Testing
Vaginal pH and Cervicovaginal Specimens
Semiannually, vaginal pH was measured prior to collection of
the CVL by sampling the posterior vaginal pool with a polyeth-
ylene terephthalate swab that was then applied to paper strips
with a pH range of 4–7 (ColorpHast, EM Reagents, MCB Re-
agents, Gibbstown, NJ). CVLs were obtained by irrigation of
the cervix with 10 mL of nonbacteriostatic sterile saline, fol-
lowed by aspiration from the posterior fornix. Following collec-
tion, CVLs were refrigerated at <10°C until transported to the
laboratory on ice within 4 hours, where they were vortexed gent-
ly and aliquoted under a hood (using sterile conditions) into
1-mL units and then frozen at −80°C until requested for testing.
Detection of HPV DNA
HPV DNA was detected with a L1 consensus primer MY09/
MY11/HMB01 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Primer
set PC04/GH20, which amplifies a 268–base pair cellular β-glo-
bin DNA fragment, was included as an internal control to assess
the adequacy of amplification, as previously described [19–21].
Amplification products were probed for the presence of any
HPV DNA with a generic probe mixture and then with filters
individually hybridized with type-specific biotinylated oligonu-
cleotide probes for HPV 6, 11, 13, 16, 18< 26, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35,
39, 40, 42, 45, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 61, 62, 64, 66, 67,
68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, and 89. Oncogenic
HPV types were defined according to the recommendations of
the International Agency for Research on Cancer [22].
Characterization of the Cervicovaginal Microbiota
CVL specimens were thawed and centrifuged to pellet microbes.
Microbial DNA was isolated using the FastDNA Spin Kit for
Soil (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH). Pyrosequencing of barcoded
16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene V1-V2 region amplicons was

 performed as described previously [8, 10]. Briefly, universal
primers 27F and 338R were used for PCR amplification of the
V1-V2 hypervariable regions of 16S rRNA genes from genomic
DNA extracts. The 338R primer included a unique sequence tag
to barcode each sample. Barcoded amplicons were pooled in
equimolar concentration and pyrosequenced on a Roche/454
Life Sciences FLX instrument. QIIME software [23] was used
to bin the sequences based on their barcode, trim the primers
and barcodes, and remove sequences with homopolymeric runs
longer than 8 base pairs and those with ambiguous base calls
and run shorter than 100 base pairs. Detection of chimeric se-
quences was performed using the UCHIME component of
UCLUST, and chimeric sequences were removed. Taxonomic
assignments were performed using the Ribosomal Database
Project (RDP) Classifier trained on version 10 of the RDP da-
tabase [24,25].The presence of amplification in subject samples
was confirmed by gel electrophoresis, while negative controls
(no template) were also subjected to PCR and showed no am-
plification. In general, each sample was run once since our pre-
vious studies indicated that duplicates of the PCR amplification
and pyrosequencing have low variability [8, 10]. Nonetheless,
repeat testing of several current samples across batches and
runs was conducted and showed little variability in results be-
tween these runs. For the 398 samples in the current study, we
obtained 2 387 346 high-quality sequences, with an average of
6266 sequences (range, 183–40 627) from each sample. Despite
these several steps and results, as in other microbiome studies,
we cannot fully exclude the possibility of bias due to sequencing
variability, primer bias, and sequencing platform biases.
Statistical Methods
We characterized demographic and risk factor data at the index
visit for each of the 3 study groups, with statistical differences
between groups assessed using analysis of variance (ANOVA;
for continuous variables), the Kruskal–Wallis test (for continu-
ous variables with nonnormal distributions), or the χ2 test (for
categorical data). Correlations between vaginal pH and the RA
of Lactobacillus species were measured using Spearman correla-
tion. To cluster pyrosequencing 16S rRNA results into corre-
sponding community state types (CSTs), we used hierarchical
clustering based on RA with Euclidean distance and Ward link-
age. The number of clusters was determined by the Milligan
point-biserial criterion [26, 27]. The Shannon diversity index
(SDI) was calculated for the microbiome at each patient visit
in the data set [28].
The primary outcomes were detection of (1) any HPV and
(2) any oncogenic HPV. The associations of SDI or CST with
prevalent HPV detection were assessed using generalized esti-
mating equation (GEE) logistic regression, as previously de-
scribed [29]. These models address serial testing of women
over time (ie, repeated cross-sectional measures of association
with prevalent HPV detection at each visit) and potential
concurrent multitype infection by HPV, while accounting for
the intraindividual correlation of the repeated observations.
This approach made it possible to incorporate all the available
type-specific HPV data at each person-visit, as well as time-up-
dated covariates. It is a highly efficient analytic method, widely
used in HPV research [30,31].In addition to CSTs, we conduct-
ed a priori–planned analyses of the RA of lactobacilli (at the
genus and species level), modeled as both continuous and ordi-
nal data. Histograms of Lactobacillus species as a group (Fig-
ure 1) and individual species suggested similar cut points of
low (<7.5%), medium (7.5%–82.5%), and high (≥82.5%) RA.
Vaginal pH was also examined as a continuous and an ordinal
variable (with cut points based on the Amsel criteria for diag-
nosis of BV [10]). All covariates except study group were time
dependent. Furthermore, to study temporal associations related
to changes in CSTs and HPV detection over time, we used
continuous-time multistate Markov models fit using maximum
likelihood, as described in an earlier article [15]. All tests were
2-sided, with a P value of .05 used to define significance.
RESULTS
Select characteristics of the cohort at the index visit are shown in
Table 1. The average age of participants was 32.1 years, and by
design all subjects were African American and premenopausal
(see “Methods” section). Women with rapidly progression of
HIV-associated immunosuppression had a lower CD4+ T-cell
count than HIV-infected women with stable immune status
and HIV-uninfected women (P < .001). A majority of the
women in all 3 groups had a lifetime number of male sex part-
ners of >10, were current or former smokers, and had not used
oral contraceptives in the past 6 months. HIV-uninfected
women were less likely than HIV-infected women to use con-
doms in the past 6 months (P = .001). Self-report of Trichomo-

 6 months did not differ between the 3 groups, although by de-
sign subjects were excluded if laboratory testing at the index
visit detected gonorrhea, syphilis, trichomoniasis, or chlamydial
infection. The median number of CVLs tested for both micro-
biome and HPV in the current study was 6 (range, 2–11); the
median follow-up time was 82.8 person-months (range, 15.6–
137.7 person-months).
Table 2 shows Spearman correlations between Lactobacillus
species RA and pH. The RA of each Lactobacillus species was
inversely associated with pH. The correlation coefficients for
any individual species of Lactobacillus was greatest for L. crisp-
atus (r = −0.48), although the highest correlation we observed
was for Lactobacillus species (ie, at the genus level; r = −0.67).
Hierarchical clustering found 6 CSTs, with 5 dominated by
an individual Lactobacillus species, whereas CST IV-B com-
prised a variety of genera (eg, Prevotella, Atopobium, Mega-
sphaera, and Sneathia) with a low RA of Lactobacillus species.
Figure 2 displays a heat map of the RA data for the 25 most
abundant genera or species and how they cluster within each
CST. L. crispatus dominated CST I, CST II was dominated by
Lactobacillus gasseri, both CST III and IV-A were dominated
by Lactobacillus iners, and CST V was dominated by Lactobacil-
lus jensenii. Figure 2 additionally shows the SDI for each study
visit, and as expected CSTs I through IV-A and V (each dom-
inated by a single Lactobacillus species) had a low SDI, com-
pared with CST IV-B. The figure also presents the proportion
of oncogenic HPV–positive women-visits for each CST.
Table 3 shows multivariate GEE logistic regression models of
the associations between CSTs and the prevalent detection of
HPV. These models adjusted for HIV study group, time-updat-
ed covariates, and intra-individual correlations between repeat-
ed cross-sectional measures of association with prevalent HPV
(see “Methods” section). While CST I (L. crispatus dominated)
had an inverse association with detection of any HPV and espe-
cially with any oncogenic HPV, the relationship was of border-
line statistical significance (eg, odds ratio [OR] for oncogenic
HPV was 0.30 [95% confidence interval {CI}, .08–1.11];
P = .07). In contrast, when we assessed the RA of individual Lac-
tobacillus species, characterized in an ordinal fashion (Table 4),
we observed stronger, statistically significant associations with
detection of HPV. Briefly, high (vs low) RA of L. crispatus
was significantly associated with a lower relative odds of any
HPV (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, .24–.96; Ptrend = .03) or any oncogenic
HPV (OR, 0.14; 95% CI, .01–1.59; Ptrend = .03). However, no as-
sociations were found between any HPV or oncogenic HPV de-
tection and the RA of L. iners, L. gasseri, or L. jensenii (data not
shown). In addition, no association between pH and HPV de-
tection was observed in any of the above multivariate models,
regardless of how pH was parameterized, including as a contin-
uous or as an ordinal based on Amsel criteria. Nor did exclusion
of pH from the above models discernibly alter any findings
(data not shown). When we assessed SDI tertile instead of
CST or Lactobacillus species in multivariate GEE logistic regres-
sion models, we found significantly higher oncogenic HPV de-
tection in women in the highest SDI tertile (OR, 2.04; 95% CI,
1.18–3.52; Ptrend = .01), relative to those in the lowest SDI tertile.
Last, in an exploratory analysis, we used continuous-time
multistate Markov models fit using maximum likelihood meth-
ods to assess whether transition to a CST dominated by L. crisp-
atus was associated with a change in the risk of incident
detection of HPV (ie, HPV type[s] not found in any earlier
CVLs from the same woman). The transition rate ratio
(TRR), a value that can be thought of as similar to a hazard
ratio [15], was 0.17 (95% CI, .04–.79; P = .02) after adjustment
for study group, and this effect estimate was little changed
(TRR, 0.20; 95% CI, .03–1.14; P = .07) by adjustment for addi-
tional covariates, indicating that the most appropriate model
was the parsimonious model adjusted only for study group.
DISCUSSION
In the current study, high L. crispatus RA was associated with
decreased prevalence of oncogenic HPV in HIV-infected and
HIV-uninfected women across multiple serial annual visits,
even after statistical adjustment for multiple cofactors, includ-
ing host immune status (as defined by HIV study group) and
vaginal pH. We predicted these results, because earlier (largely
cross-sectional) studies had found inverse associations between
L. crispatus abundance and the risks of several STIs [32–34].
Further, the one previous longitudinal study of cervicovaginal
microbiota and HPV, as well as cross-sectional studies in Rwan-
da and South Africa, each reported inverse associations of HPV
prevalence with CSTs dominated by L. crispatus or with L. crisp-
atus RA [15,32]. To our knowledge, the current study is the first
investigation involving serially repeated molecular characteriza-
tion of the vaginal microbiome and its relation with oncogenic
HPV in HIV-infected women. This allowed us to conduct an
exploratory analysis in which we prospectively assessed transi-
tions between CSTs over time and found that transition to an
L. crispatus–dominated CST was associated with a statistically
significant reduction in the risk of a new (previously undetect-
ed) HPV type. If correct, these data could reflect either a reduc-
tion in the rate of newly acquired (incident) HPV infection or
reduced recurrence/reactivation of previously acquired HPV.

 These findings have potential clinical implications, since they
raise the possibility that promoting high cervicovaginal levels of
L. crispatus (eg, via a vaginal suppository) may help reduce the
burden of oncogenic HPV in women. The implications may be
especially important for HIV-infected women, since the inverse
L. crispatus–oncogenic HPV associations we observed were
independent of HIV and host immune status and therefore
indicate similar potential benefit among those with a low
CD4+ T-cell count.
We additionally found that a low SDI was associated with
reduced prevalent detection of oncogenic HPV. While this is
consistent with an inverse association of oncogenic HPV with
an L. crispatus–dominated CST (which had a low SDI), it
could also reflect an inverse association of oncogenic HPV de-
tection with other low SDI CSTs or a positive association with a
high SDI CST, such as CST IV-B. However, additional analyses
failed to show significant associations of oncogenic HPV (or
any HPV) with CSTs or Lactobacillus species beyond the
L. crispatus–oncogenic HPV relationship.
The current results were also noteworthy for the lack of asso-
ciation of vaginal pH with oncogenic HPV detection in multi-
variate models. While there has been considerable discussion in
the literature regarding the potential antiviral effects of low pH
and its possible role in explaining the beneficial activity of

 Lactobacillus species against STIs, most of that research
preceded widespread use of methods for comprehensively
assessing the cervicovaginal microbiome [11]. The growing ev-
idence of species-specific (eg, L. crispatus–related) relationships
between the cervicovaginal microbiome and HPV infection ar-
gues against a significant role of pH, since production of lactic
acid is a common attribute of lactobacilli as a group, and our
data showed that the greatest association with pH was with
the RA of Lactobacillus species, not for L. crispatus RA or
CSTs dominated by L. crispatus. Thus, biologic mechanisms
other than pH are likely involved in the anti-HPV activity of
L. crispatus.
For example, recent data suggest that the 2 isoforms of lactic
acid, D-lactic acid and L-lactic acid, might differ in their micro-
bial effects. D-lactic acid (but not L-lactic acid) levels have been
inversely associated with the ability of HIV to transverse cervi-
covaginal mucous [35].An antiviral effect of D-lactic acid would
be consistent with our results for oncogenic HPV, since L. crisp-
atus produces D and L isoforms of lactic acid, whereas L. iners
produces only L-lactic acid [35,36]. L. gasseri and L jensenii also
produce D-lactic acid, and their RAs were nonsignificantly in-
versely associated with HPV detection in the current study.
Thus, high D-lactic acid levels but not acidity per se could be
associated with reduced infection and/or transmission of
certain viruses, including HPV.
While production of H2O2 has been observed in the major-
ity of L. crispatus isolates, prior data from our group suggest
that the levels of H2O2 produced are likely too limited to great-
ly affect the risk of STIs [7], especially HPV infection, since
HPV is a nonenveloped virus and, therefore, likely to be resis-
tant to H2O2. On the other hand, bacteriocins produced by
L. crispatus may have antiviral effects. Bacteriocins are riboso-
mally synthesized antimicrobial peptides and proteins [37,38].
Relatively little has been written regarding the bacteriocins
produced by cervicovaginal Lactobacillus species, with most
of the bacteriocin literature to date focused on Lactobacillus
species inhabiting the gut. L. crispatus has additionally been
noted to have potential immunomodulatory activity. For

 example, Candida albicans growth in vitro was inhibited via
modulation of Toll-like receptors 2/4 by L. crispatus in epithe-
lial cell culture [39].
While the current study contributes data suggesting a possi-
ble protective effect of L. crispatus against cervicovaginal HPV
infection in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women (inde-
pendent of pH), several limitations need to be considered.
These include the relatively small number of HIV-infected
and HIV-uninfected subjects, even though longitudinal testing
of nearly 400 CVLs was performed. This was addressed in part
by the use of efficient analytic methods able to incorporate all
available serial HPV and microbiome data. However, larger pro-
spective studies will be needed to more comprehensively study
the relation of the cervicovaginal microbiome to the full natural
history of HPV, including the presence and development of
cervical disease. These clinical/pathologic end points were too
infrequent in the current data set to adequately study. Nor
did we have sufficient data to assess statistical interaction (eg,
by immune strata), and it may require subanalyses among sex-
ually inactive women to help differentiate reactivation of previ-
ously acquired from newly acquired (incident) HPV. The study
also focused on only premenopausal African American women,
which was done to reduce the number of factors being studied.
Thus, future studies will need to include women with a broader
range of age, menopausal status, and race/ethnicity.
In summary, our results suggest a beneficial effect of L. crisp-
atus on the burden of HPV in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected
women that is unrelated to pH. Further research to better un-
derstand these relationships is strongly warranted, including
large prospective cohort studies and laboratory research to un-
derstand the mechanisms that underlie the relation of the cer-
vicovaginal microbiota with HPV infection. However, if the
current data are confirmed in large prospective cohort studies,
randomized clinical trials of L. crispatus (eg, as a probiotic
vaginal suppository) to reduce HPV and cervical disease
might be appropriate, even if the mechanisms remain uncertain.
The clinical implications could be especially important for
HIV-infected women, as the oncogenic HPV–L. crispatus rela-
tionship appeared to be independent of host immune status.
