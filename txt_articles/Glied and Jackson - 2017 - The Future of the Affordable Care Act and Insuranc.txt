 The Future of the Affordable Care Act
and Insurance Coverage
We describe the patterns of
coverage gains associated with
the Affordable Care Act (ACA)
expansions and use these pat-
terns to assess the potential
impact of alternative repeal or
repeal and replace strategies
because
Congress
and
the
president are weighing options
to repeal or replace the ACA.
We find that specific pro-
visionsofthe ACA, including the
Medicaid expansion and the
structure of premium subsidies,
havebeen associated with large
and robust gains in insurance
coverage. We evaluate the im-
pact of retaining dependent
coverage and high-risk pool
provisions and show, on the
basis of the ACA experience,
that these provisions would
have little effect on coverage.
We find that many replace-
ment proposal components, in-
cluding flat tax credits and
maintaining cost savings pro-
visions, could jeopardize the
ability of many of the ACA’s
primary beneficiaries, as well
as other Americans, to access
coverage and care. By leading
to a deterioration of the safety
net, these strategies could also
imperil population health activi-
ties. (Am J Public Health. 2017;

he Republican administra-
tion intends to repeal the
Affordable Care Act (ACA; Pa-
tient Protection and Affordable
Care Act, Pub L No. 111-148,
124 Stat. 855 [March 2010]) and
replace it with an alternative.
Such a change could have sub-
stantial effects on coverage and
access to care and on the public
health system. The simplest
repeal of the ACA would undo
it entirely and return health
insurance coverage more or less
to where it was before the ACA’s
passage, when 16% of Americans
were uninsured.1 Some critics
of the law have proposed re-
placements that retain some
popular provisions.2 The effects
of such a partial repeal depend on
the details. We use what has
been learned from the experi-
ence of the ACA expansions
to assess the potential impact of
alternative repeal and replace
strategies.
LEARNING FROM THE
AFFORDABLE CARE
ACT EXPERIENCE
Several coverage-related
provisions of the ACA took ef-
fect almost immediately upon
passage. These provisions have
continuing bipartisan support—
unfortunately, they had modest
impacts. One provision man-
dated that young adults be made
eligible for coverage on their
parents’ employer-sponsored
health plans. This extension of
eligibility expanded insurance
coverage by between one and
three million people. Another
provision created a temporary
program of high-risk pools—the
Pre-existing Condition Insurance
Plan—which offered subsidized
coverage to those with serious
chronic health conditions. It
ultimately enrolled some 130 000
people, albeit at a very high cost
per person. The limited effect
of the Pre-existing Condition
Insurance Plan on coverage
mirrored previous experience
with similar high-risk pools,
which had existed in 34 states:
they were difficult and costly to
operate and ultimately enrolled
only about 200 000 people
nationwide.3
These early implemented
provisions had limited impact on
the national insurance coverage
rate. Before the ACA’s broad
subsidized coverage options—
the focus of the current Re-
publican attack—became avail-
able, the US uninsurance rate
stood at 14.4%, and among
nonelderly adults more than one
in five were uninsured.1 Begin-
ning in January 2014, the ACA’s
new, subsidized coverage op-
tions became available. House-
holds are eligible for tax credits
for private insurance proportional
to the gap between their in-
come and the price of health
insurance coverage in their
community.4 The subsidies are
designed to encourage house-
holds to choose lower cost plans
among those available to them.
At the same time, lower in-
come households are protected
against premium increases that
affect the entire marketplace.
As community-level health in-
surance premiums rise, subsidies
rise along with them. This
subsidy design ensures that in-
creases in premiums do not give
participants an incentive to
drop their health insurance
altogether.
The subsidies and related
spending represent a substantial
federal commitment—$43
billion in 2016—to helping
middle-income Americans af-
ford coverage. New subsidies
were accompanied by new
regulations in the private in-
surance market. Coverage sold
in the nongroup market must be
available to all, regardless of
health status; may not be un-
derwritten, that is, the price of
the plan may not change to
reflect preexisting health in-
surance conditions; may not
vary in price between men and
women; and may vary in price
with age only by a factor of
three.
Finally, the ACA, as modified
by the US Supreme Court in its

 decision in NFIB v. Sebelius,5
allowed (but did not require)
states to expand their Medicaid
programs to include all docu-
mented residents with incomes
below 138% of the federal
poverty level, with most of the
cost borne by the federal gov-
ernment. As of October 2016,
31 states and Washington, DC,
have taken advantage of this
opportunity, at a federal cost
of $74 billion in 2016.6
The ACA overall reduced the
federal deficit. Although the
coverage expansions generate
net costs, the combined costs
of the expansions are more than
fully offset by reductions in
federal payments to hospitals and
other providers as well as by
new revenue provisions. Re-
ductions in provider payments
were justified on two grounds.
First, some provider payments,
such as Medicare disproportionate
share payments, are intended
to compensate providers for the
cost of treating patients who
cannot pay their bills. The
ACA’s expansions of Medicaid
were expected to reduce the
need for such payments, and
subsequent research has shown
that uncompensated care costs
declined significantly in states
that chose to expand their
Medicaid programs.7 Second,
the increase in insurance cov-
erage was expected to lead to
greater use of health services.
For many health care providers,
additional revenue generates
higher net earnings. Consistent
with these expectations, health
care spending accelerated after
implementation of the ACA
expansions.8 Despite the ACA’s
reductions in payment rates,
hospital operating margins in-
creased after implementation of
the expansions.9
The effect of the coverage
expansion provisions was dra-
matic. By the spring of 2016, the
overall US uninsurance rate had
fallen to 8.9%, the lowest level
since the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention began
collecting data in 1972.10 More
detailed state-by-state estimates
of coverage effects among
nonelderly adults from 2011 to
2015 can be derived from the
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveil-
lance System (BRFSS), which
collects data on more than
400 000 adults a year and has
used consistent questions on
health insurance throughout
this period. According to the
BRFSS, the national uninsured
rate among nonelderly adults
fell by nearly seven percentage
points with the rollout of cov-
erage, from an average of 21.6%
during the 2011 to 2013 period
to 14.7% in 2015. As Exhibits
A through C (available as a
supplement to the online version
of this article at http://www.
ajph.org) show, with the in-
troduction of the ACA, the
uninsured rate fell in every state.
In 2011 to 2013, only 11 states
had uninsured rates below
15%; by 2015, 35 states had
uninsured rates below 15%.
Uninsured rates also fell in
Massachusetts and in Hawaii,
states that had undertaken am-
bitious state-specific reform ef-
forts before the ACA.
Gains were greatest in states
that chose to adopt the Med-
icaid expansion. In states that
adopted the expansion, rates
fell, on average, from 18.9%
to 11.6%, (a 7.3% decline),
whereas in those that did not,
rates fell from 25.6% to 19.2%
(a 6.4% decline). Nonetheless,
substantial reductions in un-
insured rates were achieved
even in states that have not yet
participated in the Medicaid
expansions. For example, the
27.2% uninsured rate among
nonelderly adults in Texas in
2015 was 6.7 percentage points
lower than that state’s rate in
2011 to 2013.
Uninsuranceratesfellinallrace/
ethnicity groups—particularly
sharply among Blacks,
especially in states that expanded
Medicaid. Yet, the majority of
people who gained insurance
coverage through the law have
been non-Hispanic Whites.
The largest absolute gains in
coverage were among those
with the lowest incomes, espe-
cially in states that had expanded
Medicaid (Exhibit D, available
as a supplement to the online
version of this article at http://
www.ajph.org). Nonetheless,
higher income groups also saw
reductions in uninsurance. About
600 000 people with incomes
above $50 000 gained coverage
between 2011 to 2013 and 2015.
The pattern of coverage gains
points to the importance of the
ACA’s subsidies, rather than its
insurance reforms, in contrib-
uting to increases in coverage.
For example, in percentage
terms, coverage gains have
been comparable across all age
groups: both among older
adults—who benefited from the
elimination of underwriting, the
age bands, and the elimination
of preexisting condition
restrictions—and among younger
adults—who largely did not
(Exhibit E, available as a sup-
plement to the online version of
this article at http://www.ajph.
org). Because the initial unin-
surance rate was much higher
among young adults, about 1.5
times as many young adults
aged 25 to 34 years gained
coverage through the expan-
sions as did older adults aged
55 to 64 years. Similarly, the
BRFSS data since 2011 does not
show any substantial change
in the composition of the un-
insured in terms of general health
status (Exhibit F, available as
a supplement to the online
version of this article at http://
www.ajph.org).
The 2014 expansions were
much more effective in
expanding coverage than were
the more modest steps taken
in 2011. Notably, just as many
of those aged 18 to 24 years
gained coverage through the
later expansions as had through
the earlier dependent coverage
provisions—those gaining cov-
erage later were more likely to
be from low-income families
in which the parents themselves
did not have stable employer-
sponsored coverage. Five
times as many people who
self-reported poor health gained
coverage through the expan-
sions of 2014 as the total
number who had been covered
under the earlier Pre-existing
Condition Insurance Pools.
These patterns are consistent
with the observation that the
primary reason given by people
who lacked coverage before the
ACA was that coverage was
simply too expensive.
IMPLICATIONS FOR
ALTERNATIVE
REFORM PROPOSALS
The ACA generated large,
widespread coverage gains. If
the entire act were repealed,
these coverage gains would
disappear, and the share of
the US population lacking in-
surance coverage, which had
increased steadily from 2001
through 2011, would resume
its upward climb.
Several of the early expansion
provisions—allowing young
adults to remain on their parents’
health insurance and creating
a system of high-risk pools—are
included in many Republican
replacement proposals.11,12

 experience shows that retaining
these early expansion provisions
while eliminating the subsidies
and Medicaid expansions would
counterbalance only about
10% of the precipitous drop in
coverage generated by full
repeal.
In addition to the early ex-
pansion components, many
ACA replacement proposals
would retain the restrictions
against insurers’ charging higher
premiums to sicker people,
while eliminating or changing
the nature of the premium tax
credits and Medicaid expansion.
For example, some proposals
offer flat tax credits adjusted only
for age, which increase only at
a predefined rate regardless of
community-wide premium
growth.12 These scenarios could
leave many Americans worse off
than they had been before the
ACA was passed.
In insurance markets that do
not price on the basis of health
status, healthy consumers seek
to segregate themselves from
sicker people, and insurers re-
spond by offering ever skimpier
coverage to the healthy and
ever higher premiums to the
sick. This is not just a theoretical
expectation. Before the ACA,
several states had imposed reg-
ulations restricting underwriting
and preexisting condition re-
strictions in their nongroup
markets. The consequent selec-
tion spirals ultimately under-
mined entire state insurance
markets. The ACA subsidies, in
their design, counterbalance this
effect, encouraging healthy
consumers to buy coverage
alongside sicker consumers and
protecting against selection
spirals even when premiums rise.
Without subsidies that protect
consumers against community-
wide premium growth, a ban on
preexisting condition restrictions
and health-based underwriting
could readily destroy nongroup
insurance markets.
Similarly, many plans propose
to replace the ACA’s Medicaid
expansion with either per capita
allotments or block grants of
unspecified size.11 Previous an-
alyses of a block grant alternative
to the Medicaid expansion
predicted massive state-level
rollbacks in Medicaid coverage
that would leave very large
numbers of poor people without
insurance coverage.13
The worst repeal scenario
would eliminate subsidies and
retain the act’s reductions in
payments to hospitals and other
providers. This scenario could
be accomplished through the
budget reconciliation process,
which requires only 51 votes
to pass the Senate. Recall that
providers accepted the existing
payment reductions in return
for the combination of reduced
uncompensated care costs and
higher expected revenue from
newly insured patients. Hospi-
tals’ experience since 2014 sug-
gests that this tradeoff—lower
payments in exchange for higher
paid volume—was justified,
and the gains were realized. If
the Medicaid expansions were
to be repealed, these providers
would face an even greater
burden of uncompensated care.
If the subsidies were repealed,
providers would face losses in
revenue from substantial de-
clines in the number of insured
patients. Both of these forces
would exacerbate the effects of
the continuing payment cuts.
CONCLUSIONS
Our analyses of the gains in
coverage achieved through
implementation of the ACA’s
coverage expansions, like other
models, clearly indicate that
repealing the ACA would lead
many millions of Americans to
lose their health insurance cov-
erage.13 Most advocates of
repeal promise to replace the
ACA with an alternative health
reform design. The ACA is by
no means perfect, and alternative
designs might well generate
improvements—but the effects
will depend critically on the
details.
The ACA experience shows
that young adult provisions
and high-risk pools would to-
gether do very little to restore
coverage. Replacing the ACA’s
subsidies with flat tax credits,
while retaining the popular in-
surance rating provisions, could
lead to the collapse of health
insurance markets. Eliminating
coverage expansions while
retaining provider payment cuts
could devastate the health care
safety net. The combination
of reduced coverage and a di-
minished safety net would put
new pressures on public health
departments. Rather than
emphasizing population health,
they would once again become
providers of last resort. Those
concerned with public health
and with access to preventive,
curative, and palliative care for
vulnerable populations should
monitor proposed designs very
carefully.
