Introduction
Circadian rhythms are observed in a variety of physiological pro-
cesses, including sleep/wake cycles, in organisms ranging from
bacteria to mammals. Circadian rhythmicity is believed to be
generated at the cellular level by circadian core oscillators, which
not only reside in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hy-
pothalamus but also in non-SCN brain regions and peripheral
tissues (Young et al., 2001; Storch et al., 2002; Mu
¨hlbauer et al.,
2004; Shimba et al., 2005). Circadian rhythms are generated by
circadian locomotor output cycles protein kaput (clock) gene
feedback loops. The positive loop is comprised of brain and mus-
cle aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein-1
(Bmal1) and Clock. The Bmal1/Clock complex binds to the
E-box motif and regulates the transcription of various genes. The
positive loop also promotes the transcription of genes in the neg-
ative loop, including period (Per) and cryptochrome (Cry).
These proteins negatively regulate gene transcription by inhibit-
ing the transcriptional activity of the Bmal1/Clock complex.
Once the Per/Cry repressor complex is ubiquitinated and de-
graded by the proteasome, the Bmal1/Clock complex activates a
new transcriptional cycle with oscillatory rhythmicity (Gekakis et

Significance Statement
Circadian rhythm disturbances may play a role in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Our results revealed
that one of the circadian clock components maintains the integrity of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) by regulating vascular-
embedded pericytes. These cells were recently identified as a vital component for the control of BBB permeability and cerebral
blood flow. Our present study demonstrates the involvement of circadian clock component Bmal1 in BBB homeostasis and
highlights the role of Bmal1 dysfunction in multiple neurological diseases.

2000).
Abnormal sleep behaviors are commonly observed in patients
with psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. Several studies
have suggested that the disruption of circadian rhythm machin-
ery is involved in the pathogenesis of these diseases (Schibler,
2007; Wulff et al., 2010; Kondratova and Kondratov, 2012). Mus-
iek et al. (2013) reported that mice with a targeted deletion of
Bmal1 in the brain showed impaired neuronal connectivity and
severe age-dependent astrogliosis, indicating that impaired clock
gene function may lead to neurodegeneration. However, how
disruption of circadian clock system causes this homeostatic im-
balance in the brain remains poorly understood.
Here, we show that gene ablation of Bmal1, a central regulator
of the positive feedback loop of the circadian clock system, disrupts
blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity. Bmal1 deficiency leads to peri-
cyte dysfunction, BBB hyperpermeability, and marked astrogliosis.
Thus, our data demonstrate that Bmal1 function regulates BBB ho-
meostasis in the brain and provide insight into the development of
new therapeutic/diagnostic strategies for patients with psychiatric
and neurodegenerative diseases.
Materials and Methods
Animals. Bmal1 � / � mice (Shimba et al., 2011), Bmal1fl/fl mice (stock
#007688, The Jackson Laboratory; Storch et al., 2007), Nestin-Cre mice
(stock #003771, The Jackson Laboratory; Tronche et al., 1999), Synapsin
I-Cre (Zhu et al., 2001), S100�-Cre (Tanaka et al., 2008), and Nestin-GFP
mice (Mignone et al., 2004) were backcrossed with C57BL/J mice at least
six times. Mice were bred under the following standard animal housing
conditions: 23 � 1°C, 55% humidity, 12 h light/dark cycle, and standard
laboratory food and water available ad libitum. RNA was extracted from
the calvaria at different diurnal times. Zeitgeber time (ZT) 0 and ZT12
are defined as the time of lights-on and lights-off, respectively. Genotyp-
ing was performed by PCR using tail genomic DNA with the primers
listed in Table 1. The study protocol was approved by the Committee
for Ethical Use of Experimental Animals at Kanazawa University in
Kanazawa, Japan.
Open field test. Adult male mice were tested using a 42.2 cm 2 wood
board enclosure with 30 cm walls. Mice were placed at the center of open
field, and images were recorded for 10 min. Quantitative analyses were
performed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). The x-y
coordinates of the mice in each picture were determined using ImageJ to
represent the center of mass of the animal. The total distance traveled
represents the sum of all displacements of the mouse.
Immunohistochemistry. Adult male mice at age 8–12 weeks were
deeply anesthetized with diethyl ether before an intracardial perfu-
sion with saline and 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains and spinal cords
were removed, postfixed overnight, and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose.
For double-immunohistochemical staining, frozen coronal sections
were cut at a thickness of 30 �m using a cryostat (CM 3050, Leica).
Sections were incubated in a blocking solution for 1 h followed by incu-
bation with the primary antibodies for 24 h at 4°C. After washing in PBS,
sections were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with the secondary
antibodies. The antibodies used in this study are listed in Table 2. Con-
focal images were acquired using LSM710 and Zen 2009 software (Carl
Zeiss). Quantitative image analyses were performed using ImageJ soft-
ware. Pericyte coverage (Desmin/CD31 or CD13/CD31) was quantified
using ImageJ to measure the percentage area of Desmin � or CD13 �
pericytes versus CD31 � vessels. The CD31 � area per square millimeter
was defined as the vascular density.

Results
Bmal1 deletion in Bmal1nestin
�/� mice causes astroglial activation
in the brain
A previous study by Musiek et al. (2013) demonstrated that
brain-specific Bmal1-knock-out mice, generated by crossing
Bmal1fl/fl mice with Nestin-Cre mice, exhibited marked age-
dependent cerebral astrogliosis, synaptic degeneration, and be-
havioral abnormalities, including novelty-induced hyperactivity.
We confirmed these phenotypes in Nestin-Cre;Bmal1fl/fl (Bmal1nestin
�/�)
mice and evaluated whether the astrogliosis observed in
Bmal1nestin
�/� was due an increase in the total number of astrocytes
or an increase in the activation of existing astrocytes. As previ-
ously described (Musiek et al., 2013), Bmal1nestin
�/� mice exhibited
novelty-induced hyperactivity during open-field testing (Con-
trol, n � 9; Bmal1nestin
�/� , n � 4; p � 0.0006; Fig. 1A). GFAP � cells
were significantly elevated in the cerebral cortex and hippocam-
pal dentate gyrus of Bmal1nestin
�/� mice (p � 0.002); however, the
number of S100� � cells, another astrocyte marker, as well as the
number of other neuronal cell markers, including NeuN, CD11b,
and Iba1, was comparable in the cerebral cortex between control
and Bmal1nestin
�/� mice (n � 3/group; Fig. 1B–D). The percentage of
GFAP �/S100� � cells was significantly elevated in Bmal1nestin
�/�
mice (p � 0.001; Fig. 1D). Similar results were observed in the
spinal cord of Bmal1nestin
�/� mice (n � 3/group; number of cells, p �
0.003; percentage of GFAP �/S100� � cells, p � 0.008; Fig. 1E).
These data suggest that the deletion of Bmal1 does not increase
the number of astrocytes but rather increases the activation of
pre-existing astrocytes.
Bmal1 deletion in Bmal1nestin
�/� mice causes BBB
hyperpermeability via pericyte loss
Astrocytes contribute to the regulation of neural transmission
and progression of neurodegeneration and, along with endothe-
lial cells and pericytes in the CNS, are a key component of BBB
(Zlokovic
´, 2008; Segura et al., 2009). A decline in BBB integrity
induces the leakage of blood-derived factors and subsequent as-
troglial activation (Adornato and Lampert, 1971; Brett et al.,
1995; Schachtrup et al., 2010). To determine the cause of astro-
cyte activation in Bmal1nestin
�/� mice, we assessed BBB integrity in
these mice at age 8–10 weeks. We evaluated the water content of
Bmal1nestin
�/� brains by measuring the ratio of wet weight to dry
weight. The water content of the brain was significantly higher in
Bmal1nestin
�/� mice when compared with control mice (control, n �
6; Bmal1nestin
�/� , n � 5; p � 0.027; Fig. 2A). Bmal1nestin
�/� mice showed
an increased vascular permeability to Evans Blue dye (100 mg/kg;
Fig. 2B) and biotin (100 mg/kg; n � 3/group; percentage of control
leakage area, p � 0.014; Fig. 2C) throughout the CNS parenchyma,
suggesting that Bmal1 deletion leads to BBB hyperpermeability.
Next, we assessed endothelial cells and pericytes, which are
essential for the maintenance of BBB integrity. Pericytes are em-
bedded in the basement membrane of blood vessels, and the peri-
cyte coverage of blood vessels in the CNS inversely correlates with
BBB permeability in embryos and adult brains (Bell et al., 2010;
Daneman et al., 2010). Double-immunohistochemical analysis
for CD31 (marker for endothelial cells) and pericyte markers,
including Desmin and CD13, clearly showed the progressive
loss of pericyte coverage in the cerebral cortex of 10-week-old
Bmal1nestin
�/� mice compared with littermate controls (n � 3/group;
Desmin, p � 0.044; CD13, p � 0.001; Fig. 2D). Platelet-derived
growth factor receptor � (PDGFR�) is another pericyte marker.
Bmal1nestin
�/� mice showed a drastic decrease in the number of
PDGFR� � cells in the cerebral cortex (n � 3/group; p � 0.004;
Fig. 2D). Aquaporin 4 (Aqp4) is a water channel protein that is
expressed in astrocyte end-feet nearest the neurovascular unit,
and it is involved in brain volume homeostasis and in the patho-
genesis of brain edema (Nielsen et al., 1997). In control mice,
Aqp4 expression was observed in the CD31 � endothelial lining of
the vasculature, namely in perivascular glial processes, as re-
ported previously (Nielsen et al., 1997). However, Bmal1nestin
�/�
mice exhibited a drastic decrease in the Aqp4 � area in the cere-
bral cortex (n � 3/group; p � 0.021; Fig. 2E).
Moreover, astroglial activation and the loss of pericyte marker
expression were age dependent. These parameters were not ob-
served in Bmal1nestin
�/� mice at age 1 and 2 weeks, but they were
detected at age 4 weeks (n � 3/group; number of GFAP � cells,
p � 0.019; percentage of Desmin � cells, p � 0.045; percentage of
CD13 � cells, p � 0.034; number of PDGFR� � cells, p � 0.048;
Fig. 3A,B). Thus, our results indicate that Bmal1 deletion causes
pericyte dysfunction and BBB hyperpermeability.
Bmal1 deletion causes dysfunction of Nestin-GFP � pericytes
in the brain
The loss of pericytes and BBB hyperpermeability occurs in
Nestin-Cre-targeted and/or lineage cells that are Bmal1 deficient.
Although the typical lineage cells of Nestin-Cre-targeted cells are
neurons and astrocytes, neuron-specific (Bmal1synapsinI
�/�
) and
astrocyte-specific (Bmal1s100�
�/� ) Bmal1 knock-out mice did not
exhibit any abnormal phenotypes, including hyperactivity in
open-field testing (Fig. 4A), astroglial activation (Fig. 4B), and
decreased pericyte coverage and PDGFR� expression (Fig. 4C) in
the brain. The intermediate filament protein Nestin, which was
first reported as a marker of neuroectoderm progenitors (Lend-
ahl et al., 1990), is expressed in pericytes (Alliot et al., 1999; Dore-
Duffy et al., 2006). In transgenic mice expressing GFP under
control of the 5.8 kb promoter and 1.8 kb second intron of the
Nestin gene (Nestin-GFP�; Mignone et al., 2004; Ono et al.,

 2014), Nestin-GFP� cells were observed throughout the cerebral
cortex (Fig. 5A), hippocampus (Fig. 5-1A available at 10.1523/
JNEUROSCI.3639-16.2017.f5-1), and the spinal cord (Fig. 5B).
Immunohistochemical analysis clearly revealed that Nestin-
GFP� cells were positive for Bmal1 in the cerebral cortex (Fig.
5C). Next, we assessed the cell types of Nestin-GFP � cells via
immunohistochemical analysis. Nestin-GFP � cells in the cere-
bral cortex were negative for NeuN, GFAP, and CD11b and were
positive for Desmin, CD13, and PDGFR� (Fig. 5D,E, and Fig.
5-1B,C available at 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3639-16.2017.f5-1). In
addition, these cells were present near CD31 � endothelial cells
and �-smooth muscle actin (�SMA) � vascular smooth muscle
cells, indicating that brain pericytes are Nestin-GFP� cells.

(Bmal1�/�) mice expressing the GFP under the Nestin promoter
(Nestin-GFP�Bmal1�/�) by crossing Bmal1�/� mice with Nestin-
GFP mice (n � 4/group). In 8-week-old Nestin-GFP�Bmal1�/�
mice, GFAP �-activated astrocytes were markedly increased
surrounding the Nestin-GFP� cells in the cerebral cortex (Fig. 6A).
On the other hand, the number of Nestin-GFP� cells were compa-
rable between Nestin-GFP�Bmal1�/� and Nestin-GFP�Bmal1�/�
mice (Fig. 6A,G). In addition, the areas of CD31� endothelial cells
(vascular density; Fig. 6B,G) and �SMA� smooth muscle cells
(Fig. 6C,G) were comparable between Nestin-GFP�Bmal1�/� and
Nestin-GFP�Bmal1�/� mice. However, the significant decreases
were seen in the percentages of Desmin� (p � 0.008; Fig. 6D,G),
CD13�(p�0.002;Fig.6E,G),andPDGFR��cells(p�0.001;Fig.
6F,G) among Nestin-GFP� cells. These results suggesting that
Bmal1 deletion should not cause the “loss” of pericyte, but the “dys-
function” of Nestin-GFP� pericytes in CNS.
PDGFR� is a receptor for PDGF-BB secreted from endothelial
cells. Precise PDGF-BB/PDGFR� signaling is essential for main-
taining BBB integrity in the CNS (Winkler et al., 2011). Mice with
partially disrupted PDGF-BB/PDGFR� signaling exhibited age-
dependent BBB breakdown (Armulik et al., 2010; Daneman et al.,
2010). Therefore, we assessed whether circadian clock proteins
regulate PDGFR� expression in pericytes. Pdgfrb expression was
evaluated in the TR-PCT1 brain pericyte cell line. Bmal1 knock-
down by siRNA decreased the expression of Pdgfrb in the TR-
PCT1 cells (siControl, n � 5; siBmal1, n � 3; p � 0.001; Fig. 6H).
These experiments revealed that PDGFR� transcription is posi-
tively controlled by Bmal1, suggesting that the decreased Bmal1
expression in Nestin-GFP � pericytes is responsible for down-
regulating PDGFR� expression in Bmal1nestin
�/� mice.

 Discussion
The essential finding of this study is that the disruption of Bmal1,
which is part of the positive feedback loop of the circadian clock
system, induces pericyte dysfunction and BBB hyperpermeabil-
ity. In contrast to the vessels in peripheral organs, BBB restricts
the entry of polar molecules into the brain (Mann et al., 1985;
Zlokovic
´ et al., 1985a,b; Zlokovic and Apuzzo, 1997). However,
some molecules can be transported into the brain via specific

 transporters expressed in the brain endothelium under physio-
logical or pathological conditions (Zlokovic
´ et al., 1987, 1990).
In addition, several BBB peptide transport mechanisms exist,
includingreceptor-mediated,adsorptive-mediated,carrier-medi-
ated, and nonspecific passive diffusion (Zlokovic
´, 1995). Clinical
studies have also reported BBB dysfunction and brain inflamma-
tion in patients with psychiatric disorders (Shalev et al., 2009;
Najjar et al., 2013). The previous report by Musiek et al. (2013)
showed that Bmal1nestin
�/� mice exhibited several neuronal deficits,
such as axonal terminal degeneration, disrupted resting-state
functional connectivity, and widespread astrocyte activation.
Our current findings support the hypothesis that decreased ex-
pression of the circadian clock component induces psychiatric or
neurodegenerative disease by decreasing BBB integrity. Although
many studies have identified the functional importance of clock
genes in the brain, we are the first to directly demonstrate the
involvement of the circadian clock component in BBB
integrity.
Pericytes are embedded within the vascular basement mem-
brane of blood vessels and control BBB permeability and cerebral
blood flow (Winkler et al., 2011). Accumulating evidence sug-
gests that pericyte degeneration induces BBB breakdown and
neuronal degeneration following the accumulation of blood-
derived neurotoxins (Mann et al., 1985; Zlokovic
´ et al., 1990; Bell
et al., 2010) in complex neurological disorders, such as Alzhei-
mer’s disease (Zlokovic
´ et al., 1985a,b, 1987), amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (Zlokovic
´, 1995), and retinopathy related to type 2 dia-
betes mellitus (Nielsen et al., 1997; Zlokovic and Apuzzo, 1997).
Bmal1nestin
�/� mice exhibited pericyte dysfunction, BBB hyperper-
meability, and marked astrocyte activation. These data strongly
indicate that genetic disruption of the circadian clock protein
affects BBB homeostasis via pericyte dysfunction in vivo.
Our observation that Bmal1nestin
�/� mice exhibit pericyte dys-
function, BBB hyperpermeability, and astrocyte activation pro-
vides a novel mechanism as to how circadian clock component
Bmal1 regulates pericyte function. PDGF-BB is secreted from
endothelial cells and binds to the PDGFR� on pericytes, which is
essential for the recruitment, proliferation, migration, and at-
tachment of pericytes (Winkler et al., 2011). Studies in mouse
models with partially disrupted PDGF-BB/PDGFR� signaling
showed an age-dependent BBB breakdown (Armulik et al., 2010;
Daneman et al., 2010). Our experiments in Nestin-GFP�Bmal1�/�
mice demonstrated that the deletion of Bmal1 does not affect the
number of Nestin-GFP� pericytes but rather changes the proper-
ties of pre-existing Nestin-GFP� pericytes (i.e., decreased PDGFR�
expression). In addition, silencing experiments illustrated that

Nakazato et al. • Clock Genes in Blood–Brain Barrier
 Bmal1 regulates Pdgfrb transcription. Although further experi-
ment should be performed to reveal the mechanisms by which
clock genes regulate PDGFR� expression; therefore, the disrup-
tion of the positive loop of the circadian clock may decrease
PDGFR� expression, leading to pericyte dysfunction and re-
duced BBB integrity.
In conclusion, the circadian clock component Bmal1 regu-
lates BBB homeostasis via regulation of pericyte function. Our
findings contribute to an improved understanding of the func-
tions of the non-SCN clock system in a variety of physiological
and pathological processes involving BBB hyperpermeability.
Thus, Bmal1 may represent a novel target for the discovery and
development of therapies for many neurodegenerative and/or
psychiatric disorders related to abnormal BBB integrity.
