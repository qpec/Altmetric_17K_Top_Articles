Summary Paragraph
Sensory, motor, and cognitive operations involve the coordinated action of large neuronal 
populations across multiple brain regions in both superficial and deep structures1,2. Existing 
extracellular probes record neural activity with excellent spatial and temporal (sub-millisecond) 
resolution but from only a few dozen neurons per shank. Optical Ca2+ imaging3–5 offers more 
coverage but lacks the temporal resolution to reliably distinguish individual spikes and does not 
measure local field potentials. To date, no technology compatible with unrestrained animals has 
combined high spatiotemporal resolution with large volume coverage. To satisfy this need, we 
designed, fabricated, and tested a new silicon probe called Neuropixels. Each probe has 384 
recording channels that can programmably address 960 CMOS processing-compatible low-
impedance TiN6 sites that tile a single 10 mm long, 70x20 µm cross section shank. The 6x9 mm 
probe base is fabricated with the shank on a single chip. Voltage signals are filtered, amplified, 
multiplexed, and digitized on the base, allowing noise-free digital data transmission directly from 
the probe. The combination of dense recording sites and high channel count yielded well-isolated 
spiking activity from hundreds of neurons per probe implanted in mice and rats. Using two probes, 
more than 700 well-isolated single neurons were simultaneously recorded from five brain 
structures in an awake mouse. The fully integrated functionality and small size of Neuropixels 
probes allowed recording large populations of neurons from multiple brain structures in freely 
moving animals. This combination of high-performance electrode technology and scalable chip 
fabrication methods opens the path to record brain-wide neural activity during behavior.
Historically, the most widely employed tool for recording neuronal activity has been the 
extracellular microelectrode7. To make further progress in understanding the coordinated 
activity underlying brain computations, it is critical to increase the number of single neurons 
that can be simultaneously monitored8–10. This requires large dense arrays of recording 
sites, ideally compatible with freely-moving rodents. To this end, with the support of the 
Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Janelia Research Campus, Allen Institute for Brain 
Science, Gatsby Charitable Foundation, and Wellcome Trust, we designed, fabricated, and 
tested a new class of silicon probes11.
Neuropixels probes were developed in three phases with seven design goals. The first two 
goals were: (i) dense and extensive recording sites to isolate individual neurons across large 
regions of the brain12, and (ii) small cross-sectional area to minimize brain tissue damage. 
We achieved these two goals using a custom 130 nm CMOS fabrication process13. This 
process allowed us to place 960 sites on a single, 10 mm long, non-tapered shank with 
70x20 μm cross section. This site count on a single shank is a large improvement over 
existing multi-shank silicon probes14–16.

 We chose to focus on maximizing site count and minimizing width for a single shank 
because it presented the most essential engineering challenges. The solutions can be 
extended in a straightforward manner to multiple shanks for transverse coverage. The 12x12 
μm sites are arranged in a checkerboard pattern with 4 columns and 25 μm center to center 
nearest neighbor spacing (Figure 1a,b). Neuropixels probes feature user-programmable 
switches that allow recording channels to simultaneously address 384 of the 960 total sites. 
We found no performance loss for switchable sites compared to a test version of the probe 
with unswitchable sites (Extended Data Figure 1a,b).
We further sought to develop probes with (iii) low noise, (iv) resistance to movement 
artifacts or other interference, and (v) efficient data transmission by integrating low noise 
analog amplifiers, multiplexers, and digitizers into the probe base. This integration enables 
small size, minimal weight, noise immunity, and a digital data output stream transmitted via 
a single thin cable. The 6x9 mm base, fabricated with the same CMOS processes used for 
the shank, yielded a finished probe ~250 mg in weight, small enough for chronic implants in 
mice (Figure 1c). We used 10-bit analog-to-digital converters to minimize base area and 
power consumption. Because 10 bits do not provide sufficient resolution for wideband 
recording, the continuous data stream from each channel was split into action potential (AP, 
0.3-10 kHz) and local field potential (LFP, 0.5-1000 Hz) bands which were separately 
amplified and digitized (AP, 30 kHz; LFP, 2.5 kHz). Together with low impedance TiN sites 
(see below) this system achieves uniform low noise (AP band ~5 μV root-mean-squared 
(RMS) Figure 1d; LFP band ~9 μV RMS; Extended Data Table 1, Options 1 and 3). We 
explored the use of on-site amplifiers (buffer amplifiers under each site) but found no 
advantage in performance (Extended Data Figures 1c-f and 2). Furthermore, such active 
probes had increased noise (Extended Data Table 1) and light sensitivity (Extended Data 
Figure 3a,b).
Finally, we sought to (vi) enable long-term recording stability and (vii) ensure low-cost 
scalable fabrication. As a key element for stability and scalable fabrication, we developed 
porous TiN6 for the recording site material. Sites made of this material are compatible with 
CMOS processing and feature low, uniform impedance (149 ± 6 kOhm, Figure 1e). Our 
criterion for long-term stability was good performance out to eight weeks post-implant, a 
time frame chosen to ensure that most research questions in rodents, our focus for these 
probes, can be addressed. We found no stability difference between TiN and standard 
(PEDOT17-coated gold) site probes implanted in rat neocortex (Extended Data Figure 4a-d). 
Furthermore, probes with and without on-site amplifiers, and with and without switchable 
sites, all exhibited stable firing rates in rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) (Extended Data 
Figures 4e-g and 5). The use of high-throughput silicon fabrication processes to achieve our 
first six objectives also ensured that Neuropixels probes can be manufactured at low cost and 
large scale.
Neuropixels probes allowed us to obtain electrophysiological measurements across a large 
spatial extent with an unprecedented level of detail. In one example, a probe was inserted 
into the brain of an awake, head-fixed mouse, targeting primary visual cortex (V1) and the 
lateral posterior (LP) nucleus of the thalamus, which receives direct projections from V118. 
Because the probes record activity with the same spatial resolution along the entire shank,

 the data can be conveniently displayed as images with each site represented as a “pixel.” 
Using these images, structural boundaries can be visualized using simple measures of neural 
activity, such as multiunit firing rates or signal amplitude in certain frequency ranges (Figure 
2a-c; also see Extended Data Figure 6). From this recording (Figure 2d), 206 putative 
individual neurons were isolated from the cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus using 
automated spike sorting methods19 with manual curation20. Regions near the top and 
bottom of the probe were strongly modulated by visual stimuli (Figure 2e). Histology 
revealed that these regions corresponded to V1 and LP (Figure 2f,g).
In a separate example experiment, two probes were inserted into the brain of an awake, 
head-fixed mouse. One probe spanned sensory cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus (Figure 
3a) while the second spanned motor cortex and striatum (Figure 3b). In this experiment, we 
recorded 741 putative single neurons simultaneously.
Recordings with such high yields were the norm with Neuropixels probes, from both 
superficial and deep structures. To quantify single neuron isolation across experiments, we 
compared statistics from recordings made from multiple laboratories in diverse brain 
structures such as cortex, hippocampus, striatum, thalamus, superior colliculus, and 
cerebellum (n = 13 mice, 15 experiments). Neuropixels probes allowed isolation of 20-200 
neurons per structure (79.0 ± 55.5 per structure, Figure 3c). The number of isolated neurons 
depended on the number of sites in that region (0.64 ± 0.32 neurons per site, Figure 3d) and 
the spatial spread of each neuron’s waveform on the probe. Although most sites sampled 
signals from multiple (6.9 ± 5.1) neurons (Figure 3e), good single-neuron isolation was 
possible because each neuron was visible across 9.5 ± 5.3 sites (Figure 3e, Extended Data 
Figure 7a,b). A neuron appearing on 4-6 sites enables effective sorting12. Neuropixels 
probes maintained high signal quality across >10 acute insertions (Extended Data Figure 
7c,d).
Since light induces voltage transients in nearly all materials used for extracellular 
electrophysiology, we tested the sensitivity of Neuropixels probes to optical excitation 
conditions used for optogenetic perturbations in tandem with extracellular 
electrophysiology21. Direct illumination of the probes in saline resulted in a small, non-
saturating artifact which can be minimized using sinusoidal or ramped light pulses 
(Extended Data Figure 3c-e) or subtracted out. We were thus able to combine Neuropixels 
recording with optogenetic stimulation of both excitatory and inhibitory neuron populations 
in vivo (Extended Data Figure 8).
A variety of experiments benefit from chronic implantation of silicon probes and recording 
in freely moving rodents22,23. Due to their light weight, small footprint, and integrated 
electronics, Neuropixels probes are ideal for such recordings. While there is a prior report of 
silicon probe recordings with >300 isolated neurons16, this yield was achieved with a 16-
shank array coupled to external amplification and multiplexing electronics requiring large-
form-factor hardware, making it impractical to use the probes in freely moving rodents. We 
monitored activity for at least 8 weeks in a variety of chronic implant geometries. Not only 
is this sufficient time for most rodent studies, but onset of activity loss is usually observed 
within this time frame24.

 We tested chronic implants of Neuropixels probes and obtained large scale single-neuron 
recordings in both freely-moving rats (Figure 4 and Extended Data Figure 5) and head-fixed 
mice (Extended Data Figure 9). For example, a probe implanted in rat entorhinal cortex 
isolated the activity of 127 neurons, including 22 grid cells25, 49 days after implantation 
(Figure 4a-c). Similarly, a probe implanted in rat mPFC delivered low-noise recordings of 
hundreds of neurons (isolated using another recently developed spike sorting package26) 
simultaneously for more than 8 weeks (Figure 4d-g and Extended Data Figure 5), and a 
probe implanted in the mouse frontal cortex and lateral septal nucleus delivered stable 
chronic recordings of more than 100 neurons over >150 days (Extended Data Figure 9b). 
Across 14 chronic implants in rat mPFC, we did not observe degradation of spiking activity 
over 8 weeks (linear regression t-test, single-tailed, p>0.1). We have yet to find specific 
limits to the duration of chronic recordings with Neuropixels and saw no sign that the probes 
themselves deteriorate (Figures 4g and Extended Data Figures 5 and 9).
In summary, Neuropixels probes provide an order of magnitude increase in the number of 
simultaneously recorded neurons obtainable per shank while maintaining low noise. This 
expanded recording capability has many applications, such as simultaneously monitoring the 
inputs and outputs of diverse regions (e.g. by recording populations in thalamus 
simultaneously with a target cortical area), as well as assessing the relationship of behavior 
to activity distributed across the brain. Moreover, due to the integrated circuitry for 
amplification, multiplexing and digitization, Neuropixels probes have a small physical 
footprint and minimal cabling, important for studying unrestrained behaviors, and require 
only a simple interface board to acquire data. More generally, such integration realizes the 
promise of fully combining advanced, scalable chip fabrication methods with electrode 
technology. The 1 cm recording length — comparable to the size of the rodent brain — 
enables recording from multiple brain regions simultaneously at neuronal scale and with 
high temporal resolution, an essential step toward understanding the global coordination of 
activity fundamental to brain function27–29.

confidence interval) and 4 with active (SNR=8.95 ± 0.54) recording sites). Signal-to-noise 
(right) distributions are similar - wilcoxon rank-sum; p-value 0.78, two-sided. e,f, Signal-to-
noise ratio computed using 200,000 spikes during locomotion (red) or stationary (black) 
epochs. Recordings with passive sites (3 recordings) are depicted in e and recordings with 
active sites (4 recordings) in f. SNR distributions are similar during stationary and 
locomotion epochs with both probe options. Overall, the performance of probes with on-site 
buffer amplification is similar to that of probes with passive sites and offers no clear 
advantage in vivo.

that the drop in event rate for PEDOT-1 was due to biological factors unrelated to probe site 
integrity. e-g, Probes (Phase 2) of all four shank designs, passive, active, passive switched, 
and active switched were implanted chronically in rat mPFC. Recordings were made at least 
once per week. Data analysis, implant method, and recording procedures are described in 
detail in the supplementary text. There is no apparent downward trend in neural activity by 
either metric (e,f), thus all four shank technologies can achieve exceptional chronic stability.

 a,b, Phase 3 fully integrated probes: two of four designs were implanted in mPFC of rats as 
for Phase 2 (Extended Data Figure 4). One probe with amplified sites and two switchable, 
un-amplified probes (the preferred technology) were implanted. Amplified, switchable 
probes were implanted but were damaged electronically before adequate recording data 
could be accumulated. There was no indication of activity loss over the 8 weeks of recording 
(linear regression t-test, one-tailed, P>0.1) except for the top half of one probe (blue). This 
good performance was expected based on Phase 2 results, but the active and active switched 
probes are 70 μm wide in Phase 3 compared to 50 μm wide for Phase 2. See supplementary 
text for details of data analysis, implant method, and recording procedures. We define an 
event as time-coincident spikes recorded on a contiguous group of sites for which the 
maximum amplitude on any site in the group exceeds the threshold. Across a population of 
14 probes chronically implanted in rat mPFC (Phases 2 and 3), we did not observe 
degradation of spiking activity over 8 weeks (linear regression t-test, single-tailed, P>0.1, 
n=30 sessions). The sole exception to this observation is shown in a and b above (blue). In 
this case, the upper half of the distal most 3.8 mm array lost nearly all activity over the first 
30 days while the lower ~1.9 mm remained stable for the duration of the 8 weeks monitored. 
A few probe implants became detached from the skull after many months (3 of 16 implants, 
223-482 days) or surgery wound irritation required the subject animal to be euthanized (but 
always after >20 weeks). c, mPFC recording, 200 ms of activity traces and examples of

 Figure 2. Recording from large neuronal populations with a single probe in an awake head-fixed 
mouse.
Signals were acquired from a Neuropixels probe inserted through primary visual cortex 
(V1), CA1 and dentate gyrus (DG) regions of the hippocampus, and the lateral posterior 
(LP) nucleus of the thalamus. Approximate structure boundaries are shown in gray next to 
probe depth scale. For the heat maps, each square represents a single site. (a) RMS 
amplitude of the AP band signal for 1 s intervals, averaged over 10 intervals. (b) Firing rate 
measured from AP band crossings of a –50 µV threshold, in a 10 s interval. (c) Gamma-band 
LFP power (35-80 Hz), computed by Welch’s method in a 1 s interval, averaged over 10 
intervals. (d) Distribution of putative single neuron locations (channel with peak amplitude), 
smoothed with a 1-dimensional Gaussian filter (radius = 4.5 sites). (e) Visual modulation 
index of spike activity (defined as ((X-Y)/X)2 where X is the 75th percentile of the PSTH 
and Y is the 25th percentile) in response to 20 Hz visual flicker (15 s duration), for single 
neurons closest to each recording site, smoothed with a 1-dimensional Gaussian filter (radius 
= 6 sites). Behind the heat maps are example traces from every 25th channel shown for the 
AP band (behind A and B) and the LFP band (behind C), along with example spike rasters 
for all putatively-isolated single neurons (behind D and E, during visual flicker stimulation); 
n=103 neurons in thalamus, 41 in hippocampus, and 62 in cortex. Vertical/horizontal scale

 Figure 3. Recording from multiple brain structures in awake head-fixed mice.
(a,b) Example experiment with two probes recording from 5 major brain structures. 
Approximate probe locations are shown overlaid on the Allen Reference Atlas at left. A total 
of 741 putative individual neurons were recorded simultaneously; number of putative single 
neurons from each structure shown in parentheses. (c-f) Quantification of neuron yield 
across 9 brain structures (n=15 recordings from 13 mice). For each recording, structure 
borders were annotated manually based on histological reconstruction or physiological 
signatures. For each structure, we computed: the total number of putative single neurons (c); 
the efficiency of isolating single neurons (total number of neurons isolated from a structure 
divided by the number of sites in that structure) (d); the density of neurons per site (number 
of neurons with median waveform maximum absolute value >20µV for each site) (e); and 
the spread of individual neurons’ waveforms across the probe (number of channels with 
median waveform maximum absolute value >20µV) (f). Box plots show median and quartile 
range (whiskers = 1.5X interquartile range). Individual data points are overlaid (number of 
points above each plot).
