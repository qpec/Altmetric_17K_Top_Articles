IMPORTANCE Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) significantly improves tumor control in the
brain after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), yet because of its association with cognitive
decline, its role in the treatment of patients with brain metastases remains controversial.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether there is less cognitive deterioration at 3 months after SRS
alone vs SRS plus WBRT.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS At 34 institutions in North America, patients with 1 to 3
brain metastases were randomized to receive SRS or SRS plus WBRT between February 2002
and December 2013.
INTERVENTIONS The WBRT dose schedule was 30 Gy in 12 fractions; the SRS dose was 18 to
22 Gy in the SRS plus WBRT group and 20 to 24 Gy for SRS alone.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was cognitive deterioration (decline
>1 SD from baseline on at least 1 cognitive test at 3 months) in participants who completed the
baseline and 3-month assessments. Secondary end points included time to intracranial failure,
quality of life, functional independence, long-term cognitive status, and overall survival.
RESULTS There were 213 randomized participants (SRS alone, n = 111; SRS plus WBRT,
n = 102) with a mean age of 60.6 years (SD, 10.5 years); 103 (48%) were women. There was
less cognitive deterioration at 3 months after SRS alone (40/63 patients [63.5%]) than when
combined with WBRT (44/48 patients [91.7%]; difference, −28.2%; 90% CI, −41.9% to
−14.4%; P < .001). Quality of life was higher at 3 months with SRS alone, including overall
quality of life (mean change from baseline, −1.3 vs −10.9 points; mean difference, 9.6; 95% CI,
3.6-15.6 points; P = .002). Time to intracranial failure was significantly shorter for SRS alone
compared with SRS plus WBRT (hazard ratio, 3.6; 95% CI, 2.2-5.9; P < .001). There was no
significant difference in functional independence at 3 months between the treatment groups
(mean change from baseline, −1.5 points for SRS alone vs −4.2 points for SRS plus WBRT;
mean difference, 2.7 points; 95% CI, −2.0 to 7.4 points; P = .26). Median overall survival was
10.4 months for SRS alone and 7.4 months for SRS plus WBRT (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% CI,
0.75-1.38; P = .92). For long-term survivors, the incidence of cognitive deterioration was less
after SRS alone at 3 months (5/11 [45.5%] vs 16/17 [94.1%]; difference, −48.7%; 95% CI,
−87.6% to −9.7%; P = .007) and at 12 months (6/10 [60%] vs 17/18 [94.4%]; difference,
−34.4%; 95% CI, −74.4% to 5.5%; P = .04).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with 1 to 3 brain metastases, the use of SRS
alone, compared with SRS combined with WBRT, resulted in less cognitive deterioration at 3
months. In the absence of a difference in overall survival, these findings suggest that for patients
with 1 to 3 brain metastases amenable to radiosurgery, SRS alone may be a preferred strategy.

ease, which is to say limited intracranial metastases, usually
defined as 1 to 3 lesions.3 Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is an
effective and commonly used treatment for brain metasta-
ses, but intracranial tumor progression is frequent after SRS
alone, primarily because of the development of new meta-
static lesions.1,4,5 Previous randomized clinical trials (RCTs)
have consistently demonstrated improved intracranial tu-
mor control with the addition of whole brain radiotherapy
(WBRT) to SRS for cerebral oligometastases; the clinical sig-
nificance of this observation, however, remains unclear. None

vantagetoadjuvantWBRT,andasingleRCThasreportedasur-
vival disadvantage.1,4,5 Additionally, central to this issue is
whether tumor progression anywhere in the brain is more det-
rimental to a patient’
s well-being than the potential deterio-
ration of cognitive function and quality of life (QOL) associ-
ated with WBRT.4,6,7 Because more than 200 000 individuals
in the United States alone are estimated to receive WBRT each
year,8 it is important that the potential benefits and risks of ad-
juvant WBRT be clearly defined. To address ongoing knowl-
edge gaps, N0574, a multi-institutional RCT, investigated the
role of adjuvant WBRT in patients with 1 to 3 brain metasta-
ses treated with SRS (see trial protocol in Supplement 1).
Methods
Study Design and Participants
Adult patients (≥18 years of age) with 1 to 3 brain metastases,
all smaller than 3 cm in diameter, were eligible for the trial. Eli-
gibility criteria included Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
performance status (score of 0, no symptoms; 1, mild symp-
toms;2,symptomatic,<50%inbedduringtheday),andpatho-
logic confirmation of extracerebral tumor site (eg, lung, breast,
prostate) from either the primary site or a metastatic lesion.
Exclusion criteria included pregnant or nursing women, men
or women of childbearing potential unwilling to use ad-
equate contraception, inability to complete a magnetic reso-
nance imaging scan with contrast, prior resection of cerebral
metastasis, chemotherapy within 7 days of preregistration or
planned chemotherapy during the radiotherapy, prior cranial
radiotherapy,leptomeningealmetastases,lesionlocatedwithin
5 mm of the optic chiasm or within the brainstem, or metas-
tases from primary germ cell tumor, small cell carcinoma, or
lymphoma. Prior to patient enrollment, each participating in-
stitutionprovidedinstitutionalreviewboardapprovalandeach
patient provided written informed consent.
Randomization and Masking
Eligible adult patients were enrolled at 34 participating insti-
tutions in the United States and Canada and were randomly
assigned in a 1:1 ratio to undergo either SRS plus WBRT or SRS
alone. Randomization was performed using a dynamic mini-
mization strategy with stratification according to age (<60 vs
≥60 years), duration of extracranial disease control (≤3 vs >3
months), number of brain metastases (1 vs 2 vs 3), and treat-
ment center. Randomized assignment to the treatment group
was done electronically. Neither patients nor clinicians were
blindedtotreatmentassignment,althoughtheneuropsycholo-
gists grading the cognitive assessments were blinded to treat-
ment assignment.
Study Treatment
PatientsrandomlyassignedtoreceiveSRSalonereceived24Gy
in a single fraction if lesions were less than 2.0 cm or 20 Gy if
lesions were 2 to 2.9 cm in maximum diameter. Patients ran-
domly assigned to undergo SRS plus WBRT received 22 Gy in
a single fraction if lesions were less than 2.0 cm or 18 Gy if le-
sions were 2 to 2.9 cm in maximum diameter. The dose was
prescribed to the highest isodose line encompassing the tar-
get, ranging from 50% to 80% of the maximum dose. Pa-
tients randomly assigned to SRS plus WBRT received 30 Gy in
12 fractions of 2.5-Gy WBRT delivered 5 days a week. Whole
brain radiotherapy began within 14 days of SRS.
Assessments
Before registration and randomization, each patient under-
went baseline evaluation consisting of history and physical ex-
amination, neurological examination, magnetic resonance
imaging, and assessment of cognitive function, QOL, and per-
formance status. Race/ethnicity data were collected as man-
dated on all National Cancer Institute (NCI)–sponsored trials
by patient self-report. All baseline evaluations as well as as-
sessment of adverse events were repeated at week 6 and
months 3, 6, 9, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48, and 60. Quality of life was
assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy–
Brain, for which the range is from 0 to 200 and higher scores
indicate better QOL.9 Functional independence was assessed
by the Barthel Index of Activities of Daily Living (ADL Index),
for which a score of 100 implies complete independence and
a lower score suggests that the patient requires some super-
vision and/or assistance.10 A well-established battery of cog-

Key Points
Question What is the effect of whole brain radiotherapy in
addition to stereotactic radiosurgery on cognitive function of
patients with 1 to 3 brain metastases?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 213 adults
with metastases amenable to radiosurgery, there was less
cognitive deterioration at 3 months after stereotactic radiosurgery
alone (64%) than after stereotactic radiosurgery plus whole brain
radiotherapy (92%), a significant difference.
Meaning In patients with 1 to 3 brain metastases, stereotactic
radiosurgery alone may be the preferred strategy.

cate worse performance), executive function (TMT Part B
[TMT-B]; range, 0-300 seconds, for which higher values de-
note worse performance), delayed memory (HVLT-R Delayed
Recall; range, 0-12, for which higher values reflect better per-
formance), and recognition (HVLT-R Recognition; range, −12
to 12, for which higher values indicate better performance).11,12
The cognitive testing was administered by a trained, certified
member of the site study team. All treatment-related toxic ef-
fects and adverse events were recorded according to NCI Com-
mon Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0.
End Points
The primary end point was cognitive deterioration (progres-
sion), defined as a decline of greater than 1 SD from baseline
on at least 1 of the 7 cognitive tests (all tests are standardized
based on published norms and transformed so that higher val-
ues represent improved cognition) at the 3-month post-SRS
evaluation. Secondary end points included time to intracra-
nial failure (eTable 1 in Supplement 2), QOL, toxic effects, func-
tional independence, cognitive outcomes for individual cog-
nitive assessments, long-term cognitive status, and overall
survival. Because of concerns regarding the accuracy of
assigning a cause of death, cause-specific survival was not
assessed.13,14 Intracranial tumor control rates at 3 months
(a post hoc analysis) were reported because these rates tem-
porally corresponded with the primary end point. Local fail-
ure was defined as an increase of greater than 25% in the size
of the perpendicular diameters of the treated lesion. Distant
brain failure was defined as the development of new, noncon-
tiguous lesions. Intracranial progression was defined as either
local or distant brain failure.
Statistical Analysis
The trial was closed on December 10, 2013, after meeting ac-
crual goals. Data for this analysis were frozen on April 23, 2015.
According to the sample size calculation, 112 evaluable pa-
tients (56 in each group) were required. This was based on a
type I error probability of .10 (2-sided), 85% power, an as-
sumed3-monthcognitivedeteriorationrateof0.65forthecon-
trol group (SRS plus WBRT), and a minimal detectable abso-
lute decrease in the 3-month cognitive deterioration of 0.25.
The study was powered to detect a change in the anticipated
3-month cognitive deterioration rate of 0.65 for the SRS plus
WBRT group, based on a clinical trial of patients with brain me-
tastases treated with WBRT who were prospectively assessed
at baseline and over time with a cognitive battery, to 0.40 or
lower for the SRS group.7 A .10 level of significance was used
because it was believed that SRS plus WBRT would cause more
cognitive deterioration and the focus was ensuring that there
was a .05 1-sided level to detect this. The trial was designed
to keep accruing until the necessary number of evaluable pa-
tients was obtained. The study used a completers analysis,
which was specified in a protocol amendment prior to analy-
sis to make cognitive deterioration the primary end point. The
basis for using a completers analysis rather than imputation
was lack of reliability of imputation methods given the small
number of patients. In addition, a separate sensitivity analy-
sis was conducted in which it was assumed that all noncom-
pleters had experienced a cognitive decline. A patient was
deemed a completer if he/she had completed baseline and
3-month cognitive tests; patients who did not complete the
3-month evaluation were not part of the primary analysis.
For primary analysis of the 3-month cognitive deteriora-
tion end point, we used a Fisher exact 2-group binomial test
to compare the proportion of evaluable patients with 3-month
cognitive deterioration between the 2 groups and report point
estimateforthedifferencewitha90%confidenceinterval(cor-
responding to the .10 level of significance). One preplanned
interim analysis was performed when 50% of the target num-
ber of evaluable patients was accrued (see the protocol in
Supplement 1 for details). Accrual was not stopped during the
interim analysis, and interim results did not cross the stop-
ping boundaries. As directed by the Alliance data and safety
monitoring board, because there was an imbalance in the pro-
portion of completers in each study group, a separate, post hoc
sensitivity analysis was performed that treated noncom-
pleters as experiencing a 3-month cognitive deterioration.
Time to intracranial failure (local and distant failure) was
analyzed using Cox proportional hazards and competing risks
models.Inthecompetingriskmodels,deathcountedasacom-
peting risk.15 Overall survival, defined as the time from ran-
domization until death due to any cause, was compared be-
tween the groups using stratified log-rank tests. Planned
subgroup analyses, specified by the stratification factors, were
conducted. A long-term survivor was defined as one who had
a cognitive evaluation 12 months or longer after randomiza-
tion. Multivariable Cox models, also used to compare overall
survival between the groups, contained the stratification vari-
ables and other prognostic variables, such as location of
primary tumor. The QOL scores were transformed to a 0- to
100-point scale (with 100 being most favorable), in which a
10-point change was considered clinically significant.16 We
compared the intergroup proportion of patients with signifi-
cant QOL deterioration using an exact binomial test, and in-
tergroup changes in QOL scores were compared using a
2-sample t test. Toxic effect rates in the 2 groups were com-
pared using the Fisher exact test. In addition to point esti-
mates, 95% confidence intervals are provided, except for the
primary end point, for which a 90% confidence interval is re-
ported. All secondary analyses used a 2-sided .05 level of sig-
nificance. There was no adjustment for multiple compari-
sons for the secondary end point analyses, so these results
should be interpreted as exploratory. All analyses were per-
formed using either SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc) or R ver-
sion 3.1.1 (R Core Team 2014).17

 prior to the 3-month evaluation, who did not return for the
3-month or a subsequent evaluation, or who did not com-
plete the required baseline tests, 151 patients were alive and
111 patients were evaluable (73.5% overall completion rate)
(Figure 1). The completion rate was 66.7% (48/72) in the SRS
plus WBRT group and 79.7% (63/79) in the SRS alone group
(difference, −13.1%; 95% CI, −28.4% to 2.3%; P = .096).
Median follow-up for all patients was 7.2 months (range,
0.0-62.5 months), and for the 111 evaluable patients it was
11.6 months (range, 2.7-62.5 months). Baseline characteris-
tics were well balanced in the groups for both the total study
population (Table 1) and the patients evaluable for the pri-
mary end point. Baseline characteristics were also well bal-
anced between evaluable and nonevaluable patients except
for worse baseline verbal fluency in the nonevaluable
patients (Controlled Oral Word Association Test, −0.8 [SD,
1.1] points vs −1.3 [SD, 1.2] points; P = .003). At baseline,
mean and median cognitive scores were below population
norms, ranging from mild to severe impairment.
Primary Analysis and Secondary Cognitive Outcomes
Cognitive deterioration, the primary end point in evaluable
patients at 3 months, was less frequent after SRS alone than
after SRS plus WBRT (40/63 [63.5%] vs 44/48 [91.7%],
respectively; difference, −28.2%; 90% CI, −41.9% to −14.4%;
P < .001). There was more deterioration in the SRS plus
WBRT group on each cognitive test (Table 2), reaching statis-
tical significance for immediate memory (30.4% vs 8.2%,
respectively; difference, 22.2%; 95% CI, 5.4%-39.1%;
P = .004), delayed memory (51.1% vs 19.7%, respectively;
difference, 31.4%; 95% CI, 12.1%-50.7%; P < .001), and verbal
fluency (18.6% vs 1.9%, respectively; difference, 16.7%; 95%
CI, 2.4%-31.0%; P = .01). Analyzing by the mean change from
baseline in normalized z scores revealed similar results, with
cognitive deterioration more pronounced after SRS plus
WBRT vs after SRS alone (eTable 2 in Supplement 2). Post
hoc analyses using different definitions of cognitive deterio-
ration (eg, 1.5-SD decline in at least 2 tests; 2-SD decline in
1 test; 3-SD decline in 1 test; eTable 3 in Supplement 2)
revealed similar results: more frequent cognitive deteriora-
tion and deterioration on each cognitive test were docu-
mented in patients treated with SRS plus WBRT.7,12 In addi-
tion, in post hoc analysis, if patients who did not complete a
3-month assessment were counted as having cognitive dete-
rioration, the results remained the same: patients treated
with SRS plus WBRT were more likely to experience cogni-
tive deterioration than those treated with SRS alone (94.6%
[88/93] vs 74.8% [77/103], respectively; difference, 19.9%;
95% CI, 9.3%-30.4%; P < .001).
QOL and Functional Independence
There were 71 and 53 patients in the SRS and SRS plus WBRT
groups, respectively, for whom QOL data were available
from baseline and from at least 1 subsequent evaluation.
There was better QOL at 3 months with SRS alone, including
overall QOL (mean change from baseline, −1.3 vs −10.9
points; mean difference, 9.6 points; 95% CI, 3.6-15.6 points;
P = .002) and functional well-being (mean change from
baseline, 0.4 vs −21.9 points; mean difference, 21.5 points;
95% CI, 4.6-38.4; P = .03) (eTable 4 in Supplement 2). Bar-
thel ADL Index scores remained high at 3 months with no
significant difference between the treatment groups (mean
change from baseline, −1.5 points with SRS alone vs −4.2
points with SRS plus WBRT; mean difference, 2.7 points;
95% CI, −2.0 to 7.4 points; P = .26).
Intracranial Tumor Control
Time to intracranial failure was significantly shorter for SRS
alone compared with SRS plus WBRT (hazard ratio, 3.6; 95%
CI, 2.2-5.9; P < .001). Intracranial tumor control rates at 3
monthswere93.7%(89/95)withSRSplusWBRTand75.3%(79/
105) with SRS alone (difference, 18.4%; 95% CI, 7.8%-29.0%;
P < .001) and were also significantly higher at 6 and 12 months
in patients who received WBRT (P < .001 for competing risk)
(Figure 2 and eTable 5 in Supplement 2). The 6- and 12-
month local and distant tumor control rates were also signifi-
cantly higher in patients who received WBRT (eTable 5). Fewer
patients underwent salvage therapy after SRS plus WBRT than
after SRS alone (7.8% vs 32.4%, respectively; difference,
−24.6%; 95% CI, −35.7% to −13.5%; P < .001) (eTable 6 in
Supplement 2).
Survival Outcomes
A survival comparison was performed on an intention-
to-treat basis using the entire study population. Despite a
higher intracranial tumor control rate associated with WBRT,

 no improvement in survival occurred; whereas the median
overall survival for SRS plus WBRT was 7.4 months, it was
10.4 months for SRS alone (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.75-
1.38; P = .92) (Figure 3). Analysis by the 3 stratification fac-
tors of age, extracranial disease status, and number of brain
metastases revealed no survival benefit in any subset, nor
did post hoc analysis by time era (2002-2006 vs 2007-2013).
Median overall survival for evaluable and nonevaluable
patients was 13.5 months and 3.0 months, respectively (post
hoc analysis hazard ratio, 3.3; 95% CI, 2.4-4.5; P < .001).
Long-term Survivors
There were 34 long-term survivors (16%) overall (19 in the
SRS plus WBRT group and 15 in the SRS alone group). Long-
term survivors were defined as evaluable patients who sur-
vived for 12 months after randomization (eTable 7 in
Supplement 2). Intracranial tumor control, analyzed in this
cohort of long-term survivors, was 94.7% (95% CI, 7.3%-
100%) at 3 months, 89.5% (95% CI, 85.2%-100%) at 6
months, and 89.5% (95% CI, 85.2%-100%) at 12 months for
SRS plus WBRT and was 73.3% (95% CI, 54.0%-99.5%),
60.0% (95% CI, 39.7%-90.7%), and 20.0% (95% CI, 7.3%-
55.0%) for SRS alone, respectively (P < .001 for competing
risk) (eTable 8 in Supplement 2). In this subset, cognitive
deterioration occurred more frequently after SRS plus
WBRT, reaching statistical significance for executive func-
tion at 12 months (TMT-B: 42.9% vs 0.0%, respectively; dif-
ference, 42.9%; 95% CI, 7.8%-77.9%; P = .05) (eTable 9 in
Supplement 2). Analyzing by the mean change from baseline
in normalized z scores (eTable 10 in Supplement 2), cognitive
deterioration was more pronounced in the SRS plus WBRT
group for immediate memory at 3 months (difference, −0.8
points; 95% CI, −1.7 to 0.1 points; P = .04) and fine motor
control at 6 months (difference, −2.2 points; 95% CI, −4.3 to
−0.1 points; P = .03). The incidence of cognitive deteriora-
tion (ie, at least a 1-SD decrease in 1 test score) was less after
SRS alone at 3 months (5/11 [45.5%] vs 16/17 [94.1%]; differ-
ence, −48.7%; 95% CI, −87.6% to −9.9%; P = .007) and at 12

Discussion
In this study, patients receiving adjuvant WBRT experienced
significant deterioration in cognitive function and QOL and
no improvement in survival despite an increase in intracra-
nial tumor control rates. This lack of improvement in sur-
vival associated with WBRT is likely due to multiple factors,
including the effectiveness of salvage therapy for intracra-
nial progression.1,4,5 This study is, to our knowledge, the
first large-scale trial to evaluate this patient population with
a comprehensive battery of cognitive and QOL instruments.
These trial features are of critical importance in the compari-
son of cancer regimens that produce similar survival advan-
tages because in these situations, the risks and benefits of
therapies related to the outcomes that clinicians can influ-
ence (eg, cognition and QOL) become paramount in guiding
treatment decisions.
To our knowledge, no large RCT has been able to ad-
equatelyandsimultaneouslyassesstheeffectofWBRTonboth
QOL and cognitive function. Three previous RCTs have exam-
ined the effect of WBRT as an adjuvant to SRS for oligometa-
static brain cancer. Each of the studies reported consistent and
significant gains in both local and distant control when WBRT
was added to radiosurgery. However, these studies produced
conflicting conclusions regarding the effect of WBRT on sur-
vival and its influence on other major clinical outcomes.
Aoyama et al1,6,18 found improved cognitive outcomes with
WBRT, leading to the conclusion that tumor control was the
most important factor in determining neurologic progres-
sion, but their trial used an insensitive measure, the Mini-
Mental State Examination, to assess cognitive function. Chang
et al4 reported the results of a single-institution trial in which
they observed significantly worse survival for patients treated
with WBRT plus SRS, a result that has never been duplicated,
raisingconcernsofunrecognizedimbalancebetweenthetreat-
ment groups, possibly due to the small number of patients en-
rolled in the trial (only 31 evaluable patients). Kocher et al5 re-
ported the results of a trial in which patients who underwent
surgical resection were coanalyzed with patients treated with
SRS. They did not evaluate cognitive function, and func-
tional independence was the primary end point. In summary,
the existing trials of adjuvant WBRT, despite being important
contributions to the oncology literature, have significant limi-
tations that have perpetuated ongoing controversies regard-
ing the role of WBRT in the treatment of cerebral metastases.
Comparingtheintracranialcontrolratesandsurvivalinthe
SRS-alone group of N0574, the results were similar, although
they tended to be slightly better than in prior phase 3 trials.1,4,5
However, the intracranial control rates and survival results in
N0574werelowerthanthoseofalargeprospectivetrialofmore
than 1100 patients with brain metastases treated up front with
SRSalone.19Therelativeconsistencyofthepresentresultswith
prior reports suggests that N0574 is applicable to the general
brain metastasis population who are candidates for SRS, and
moreover, it indicates there is no role for routine adjuvant
WBRT after SRS in patients with oligometastases.
The current trial found a higher rate of cognitive deterio-
ration after WBRT than SRS alone despite improved intracra-
nial tumor control associated with the former. Similarly, re-
sults from a smaller, single-institution trial demonstrated
deterioration in HVLT-R scores in 7 of 11 patients 4 months af-
ter SRS plus WBRT despite 100% local tumor control.4 These
findings contrast with those of a prospective trial suggesting
that the improved intracranial disease control achieved after
WBRT was the most important factor for preserving cogni-
tive function.1,6 However, these latter results could be

 explained by the insensitivity of the cognitive measurement
tool used, the Mini-Mental State Examination.6,18
Concerns regarding long-term cognitive function after
WBRT have led practitioners to recommend a smaller daily
fraction size (eg, <3 Gy/d) to potentially decrease this risk.20
In the current trial, even with a smaller fraction size (2.5
Gy/d), the patients in the WBRT group experienced worse
long-term cognitive function. More recent trials have shown
improved long-term cognitive outcomes associated with
pharmacological agents such as memantine during and after
WBRT or donepezil after cranial radiotherapy.8,21 However,
the results of these trials were only recently available and did
not affect N0574. Furthermore, although these trials repre-
sent the only high-level evidence of an intervention to
modify the negative cognitive effect of WBRT, their effect on
cognitive outcomes was minimal and did not affect the
decline in QOL associated with WBRT21 or other WBRT-
related toxic effects (eg, fatigue, alopecia, scalp erythema,
radiation necrosis). In addition, in a recently completed
phase 2 trial of hippocampal avoidance, WBRT has shown
favorable cognitive outcomes.22 Based on these results, a
phase 3 trial (NRG CC001) of hippocampal avoidance WBRT
for patients with brain metastases has been launched.
This study has several important limitations. The major-
ity of patients enrolled had lung cancer, and this trial did not
attempttoenrichforotherprimarycancers.However,lungcan-
cer is the predominant primary cancer reported in nearly all
brain metastases trials, and although different cancer histolo-
gies are known to have varying radiosensitivities, there is no
obvious biological basis to believe that the QOL and cognitive
effects of WBRT would vary between different primary
cancers.1,4,5,19,21 Additionally, there was significant patient
dropout, with the majority due to death; based on prior RCTs,
those deaths were likely predominantly due to systemic dis-
ease progression, regardless if patients received SRS alone or
SRS plus WBRT.1,4 Of note, the cognitive testing completion
rateobservedinN0574wassimilartothatreportedinasmaller,
single-institution trial that evaluated a comparable patient
population.4 Another potential limitation is that the clini-
cians and trial participants were not blinded to treatment. Lack
of blinding is typical of trials evaluating various forms of ra-
diotherapy, as sham radiation treatments would be required,
which are logistically difficult and would likely be precluded
by ethical concerns.23 Furthermore, since one group in this
study involved administration of WBRT, it would be impos-
sible to maintain true blinding for either patients or the care
team given the obvious external evidence of toxic effects re-
lated to this treatment (eg, alopecia). Another potential limi-
tation of the current trial is that the primary end point of 3
months may be too early after WBRT and, therefore, the re-
sults may reflect only a temporary and potentially reversible
decreaseincognitivefunctionandQOL.However,becausesur-
vival for the vast majority of patients with brain metastases is
measured in months, many patients would have no opportu-
nity to recover from the known toxic effects of WBRT. Even if
some delayed recovery in cognition and QOL were to occur in
a subpopulation of patients, the detrimental effects of WBRT
would negatively affect the cognitive function and QOL of re-
maining survival in a significant majority of patients.
To better address the possibility of whether improved in-
tracranial tumor control could result in better cognitive func-
tion and QOL in a group of long-term survivors, we analyzed
patients surviving at least 12 months. In this subgroup, pa-
tients receiving WBRT as opposed to SRS alone had worse cog-
nitive function over time despite a higher intracranial tumor
control rate. This finding is consistent with other prospective
trials that have reported initial cognitive declines after WBRT
to be predictive of diminished cognitive function in long-
term survivors.24 In the current trial, our analysis of long-
term survivors found worse QOL at 3 months in the WBRT
group. Another RCT similarly found worse QOL at 3 months
but also worse QOL up to 1 year with the addition of WBRT.25
Conclusions
Among patients with 1 to 3 brain metastases, the use of SRS
alone, compared with SRS combined with WBRT, resulted in
less cognitive deterioration at 3 months. In the absence of a
difference in overall survival, these findings suggest that for
patients with 1 to 3 brain metastases amenable to radiosur-
gery, SRS alone may be a preferred strategy.
