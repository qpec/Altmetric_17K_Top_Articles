IMPORTANCE The Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC-8) recommended treating systolic
blood pressure (SBP) to a target below 150 mm Hg in older adults, whereas data from the
Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) suggested that a SBP level of lower than
120 mm Hg decreases cardiovascular event rates. Target SBP guidelines have not addressed
the potential that black patients may have greater morbidity and mortality from
hypertension, especially with regard to cognitive outcomes. The association of these
discordant SBP targets with cognition and differences by race have not been systematically
evaluated in the same population.
OBJECTIVES To assess the long-term outcomes of the various recommended SBP levels and
to determine if racial differences exist based on long-term cognitive trajectories.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A total of 1657 cognitively intact older adults receiving
treatment for hypertension were studied from 1997 to 2007 in the Health Aging and Body
Composition study. Data analysis was conducted from October 1, 2016, to January 1, 2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cognition was assessed using the Modified Mini-Mental
State Examination (3MSE) 4 times and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) 5 times. At
each visit, participants were classified as having an SBP level of 120 mm Hg or lower, 121 to
139 mm Hg, 140 to 149 mm Hg, or 150 mm Hg or higher based on the mean SBP level of
2 seated readings. Mixed models assessed the association of SBP levels with 10-year cognitive
trajectories. The impact of race was tested using a race interaction term.
RESULTS During the 10-year study period, among the 1657 individuals (908 women and 784
black patients; mean [SE] age, 73.7 [0.1] years), there was a differential decrease in 3MSE and
DSST scores by the SBP levels, with the greatest decrease in the group with SBP levels of 150
mm Hg or higher (adjusted decrease was 3.7 for 3MSE and 6.2 for DSST) and the lowest
decrease in the group with SBP levels of 120 mm Hg or lower (adjusted decrease was 3.0 for
3MSE and 5.0 for DSST) (P < .001 for both). Compared with white patients, black patients
had a greater difference between the higher and lower SBP levels in the decrease in
cognition; adjusted differences between the group with SBP levels of 150 mm Hg or higher
and the group with SBP levels of 120 mm Hg or lower were –0.05 in white patients and –0.08
in black patients for 3MSE (P = .03) and –0.07 in white patients and –0.13 in black patients for
DSST (P = .05).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE For patients 70 years of age or older receiving treatment for
hypertension, a SPRINT SBP level of 120 mm Hg or lower was not associated with worsening
cognitive outcome and may be superior to the JNC-8 target for cognition. Lower SBP
treatment levels may result in improved cognition in black patients.

 T
he Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC-8) hyperten-
sionguidelinesrecommendedtreatingolderadultswith
systolic blood pressure (SBP) levels of 150 mm Hg or
higher.1 This recommendation represented a change from the
earlier recommended cutoff of lower than 140 mm Hg by the
JNC-7 panel.2 The main concern about the lower JNC-7 target
in this population was that more aggressive treatment of hy-
pertensionmaybeassociatedwithadverseeffectssuchasfalls,
cognitive decline, and mortality.3 These concerns were based
on analyses of observational data that may not have ad-
dressed the time-dependent blood pressure increases that oc-
cur with aging or the decreases that occur with the onset of
cognitive symptoms.4 There is consistent evidence that higher
blood pressure earlier in life is linked with cognitive decline
later in life.5,6 This lack of accounting for the reverse associa-
tion between blood pressure and cognition in older adults, es-
pecially those older than 75 to 80 years of age, has con-
founded much of the observational evidence.
In contrast to these observational studies, clinical trials,
including the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial
(SPRINT),7 have suggested that a more aggressive SBP target
forolderadultsmaylowerratesofcardiovasculardiseasewith-
out increasing falls. In SPRINT, a target SBP of lower than 120
mm Hg resulted in significant reductions in cardiovascular
events and deaths compared with a target SBP of 140 mm Hg,
which was true for persons younger than 75 years of age and
those 75 years of age or older. There is also widespread con-
cern based on observational studies that too much lowering
of SBP, as in SPRINT, will adversely affect cognition.8 The cog-
nitive outcomes have not yet been reported from SPRINT.
Wesoughttoinvestigatethelongitudinaloutcomesofvari-
ousSBPtargetswithregardtocognitivefunctioninolderadults
receiving treatment for hypertension in the Health Aging and
Body Composition (Health ABC) study. Our sample was com-
posed only of patients receiving treatment for hypertension.
We limited our analytical sample to patients receiving treat-
ment for hypertension to render our results relevant to hyper-
tension therapy. This design also minimizes bias introduced
by prior observational studies by the inclusion in the analyti-
cal sample of both patients with and patients without hyper-
tension and older adults receiving or not receiving treat-
ment. The main bias concerns the outcome of hypertension
treatment vs the reverse association between cognitive de-
cline and blood pressure previously reported.4
Target SBP guidelines have also not addressed the poten-
tial that black patients may have greater morbidity and mor-
tality from hypertension, including cognitive outcomes, and
hence may require a different set of targets. Hypertension is
more prevalent in black individuals than in white individuals
and is linked to greater vascular damage and morbidity; how-
ever, all guidelines have recommended the same SBP targets
for both groups.9-13 A recent study based on a nationally rep-
resentative sample reported that black patients are more likely
to report cognitive symptoms related to hypertension and that
these symptoms are related to increased mortality.14 Identi-
fying the optimal treatment target in this population is of great
necessity. This is especially critical since the JNC-8 guide-
lines for older adults were highly driven by the Hypertension
in the Very Elderly Trial (HYVET),15 in which black individu-
als were underrepresented.16
Therefore, the objective of our analysis is to investigate the
outcomeofdifferentSBPlevelswithregardtocognitioninolder
adults receiving treatment for hypertension and the differ-
ences by race in the associations between different SBP cut-
offs and cognitive outcomes in the same population.

Measures
The examiner-administered interview ascertained demo-
graphiccharacteristics(age,sex,educationallevel,income,and
race/ethnicity) and health habits (smoking and alcohol use).
Blood pressure recordings (taken while the participant was sit-
ting after a 5-minute rest) were performed twice using a mer-
cury sphygmomanometer. We used the mean SBP and mean
diastolic blood pressure measured during each examination
for this analysis. Weight (measured with a balance beam scale),
height (measured with a stadiometer), and radial pulse were
also obtained. Information on prevalent and incident health
conditions was collected by self-report. Diagnoses of heart fail-
ure, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and coronary artery dis-
ease were based on history, examination findings, and medi-
cation use. Data on current medications were collected using
Key Points
Questions How do various systolic blood pressure levels in
persons 70 to 79 years of age receiving treatment for
hypertension affect cognition, and do racial differences exist
based on long-term cognitive trajectories?
Findings The greatest decline in cognitive status was observed in
persons with systolic blood pressure levels of 150 mm Hg or
higher, whereas the least cognitive decline occurred in those with
systolic blood pressure levels of 120 mm Hg or lower. A systolic
blood pressure target of 120 mm Hg or lower was more beneficial
for black patients than white patients.
Meaning Systolic blood pressure levels of 120 mm Hg or lower in
older adults receiving treatment for hypertension is advantageous
for cognition, especially for black individuals.

expanded 100-point score to provide a lower floor and a higher
test ceiling. The 3MSE was performed in years 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was conducted from October 1, 2016, to
January 1, 2017. Systolic blood pressure (mean level of 2 seated
readings) at each visit was classified as 120 mm Hg or lower
(SPRINT target), 121 to 139 mm Hg (JNC-7 target), 140 to 149
mm Hg (JNC-8 target), or 150 mm Hg or higher (reference
group). The latter was used as a reference group because there
is consensus that an SBP level of 150 mm Hg or higher is con-
sidered to result in an uncontrolled level of hypertension, as
opposed to the 3 other SBP targets. We classified participants
into 1 of these groups at each visit. We compared baseline char-
acteristics between the 4 SBP target groups using analysis of
variance or χ2 tests and between black and white participants
using 2-tailed t tests or χ2 tests.
We then assessed the association of SBP levels with cog-
nitive trajectories during the 10-year follow-up period using
generalized mixed models.19,20 Mixed models are ideal be-
cause they account for within-subject correlations. We mod-
eled these correlations using an autoregressive structure be-
cause the association between cognitive performances is
typically stronger when the measures are conducted closer to
each other. Cognition was assessed with variable times be-
tween the repeated measures.
Because participants may fluctuate from 1 group to an-
otherduringthe10-yearfollow-upperiod,wemodeledtheSBP
categorization as a time-dependent variable. Similarly, covar-
iates were modeled as time-varying variables.21 For each cog-
nitive measure, we tested the following 2 questions: (1) Is there
a difference in cognitive change during the 10-year follow-up
period between SBP levels when using an SBP group × year
term in the model? (2) Within each SBP group, is there a sig-
nificant change in cognition using SLICE and LSMESTIMATE
statements?22Toassesstheimpactofrace,weincludeda3-way
interactiontermofrace × SBPgroup × year.Wecalculatedfrom
the mixed models the unadjusted and covariate-adjusted dif-
ferences in the rates of progression of the cognitive trajecto-
ries between white and black participants in the full analyti-
cal sample and within each SBP group. We calculated this
difference as the disparity measure, which is the rate in white
participants minus the rate in black participants (negative val-
ues meaning a greater decrease in the cognition of black par-
ticipants), and we tested the hypothesis of whether the dis-
parity measure differed by the SBP-target group. All models
were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity (except for the race
comparisons), educational level, family income, stroke, dia-
betes, seated diastolic blood pressure, and the baseline per-
formance on the corresponding cognitive measure. All analy-
ses were conducted using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).
P < .05 was considered significant.
Results
Our analytical sample included 1657 participants receiving
treatment for hypertension. The follow-up rate was 93.2% in
year5(n = 1545)and74.5%inyear10(n = 1234)(Figure1).There
was no significant difference in the mean number of fol-
low-up visits across the 4 groups (2.5 visits in all groups ex-
cept for those with a SBP level ≥150 mm Hg, where the mean
number of visits was 2.4; P = .08). The baseline characteris-
tics of the analytical sample by SBP level are presented in
Table 1. The baseline distribution was as follows: 307 partici-
pants with a SBP level of 120 mm Hg or lower (18.5%), 627 par-
ticipants with a SBP level of lower than 140 mm Hg (37.8%),
264 participants with a SBP level of lower than 150 mm Hg
(15.9%), and 459 participants with a SPB level of 150 mm Hg
or higher (57.7%). By year 10, a total of 309 of 1234 partici-
pants had a SBP level of 120 mm Hg or lower (25.0%), 457 had
a SBP level of lower than 140 mm Hg (37.0%), 197 had a SBP
level of lower than 150 mm Hg (16.0%), and 271 had a SBP level
of 150 mm Hg or higher (22.0%). As shown in Table 1, those
within the group with a SBP level of 150 mm Hg or higher were
more likely to be black (248 [54.0%]; P = .004) and less likely
to have had a myocardial infarction (56 [12.2%]; P < .001) and
to be receiving thiazide diuretics (139 [30.3%]; P = .03).
SBP Groups and Cognition
During the 10-year follow-up period, there was a differential
decrease in 3MSE and DSST scores by SBP level in patients re-
ceiving treatment for hypertension. As shown in Figure 2, the
greatest decrease in 3MSE and DSST scores was in the refer-
ence group (the covariate-adjusted 10-year decrease in score

in the group with SBP of 120 mm Hg or lower (the covariate-
adjusted 10-year decrease in score was 3.0 for the 3MSE and
5.0 for the DSST). These results of the final multivariate mixed
model adjusting for multiple covariates and potential con-
founders are presented in Table 2.
Racial Disparity, SBP Levels, and Cognition
Atbaseline784participantswereblack(47.3%).Comparedwith
the white participants, they were more likely to be women and
have a lower educational level and income, a higher body mass
index, and a greater prevalence of diabetes and stroke. Base-
line cognitive scores (3MSE and DSST) were also lower among
black participants than white participants.
There were significant racial differences in the progres-
sion of cognitive function, with black participants having a
greater mean (SE) 10-year decrease in 3MSE scores (–4.1 [0.4];
P < .001) than white participants (–2.6 [0.3]; P < .001) (P < .001
for race × year) after adjusting for covariates and baseline per-
formances. However, that was not the case for the DSST; the
mean (SE) 10-year decrease in DSST scores was –5.8 (0.4) for
white participants (P < .001) and –4.7 (0.4) for black partici-
pants (P < .001) (P = .09 for race × year).

groups with SBP levels of 150 mm Hg or higher and 120 mm Hg
or lower were –0.05 for white participants and –0.08 for black
participants for the 3MSE (P = .03 for race × SBP group × year)
and–0.07forwhiteparticipantsand–0.13forblackparticipants
for the DSST (P = .05). Within each SBP group, the covariate-
adjusted decrease in 3MSE score was higher and the covariate-
adjusted decrease in the DSST score was lower for black partici-
pants than for white participants (Figure 3).
Discussion
The findings of this study suggest that lower SBP targets, such
as those recommended by JNC-7 or used in SPRINT, are overall
superior from the cognitive perspective to the higher targets of
JNC-8. As opposed to prior observational studies in which a
heterogeneousgroupwasincluded(treatedoruntreatedandin-
dividuals with hypertension and those without hypertension),
our analysis supports the finding that higher SBP is not associ-
ated with better cognitive outcomes. This study highlights that
when important methodological issues are considered (such as
limitingsampleheterogeneity,accountingfortime-varyingblood
pressures, and addressing the reverse-association confounder
of hypertension and cognition), observational studies provide
more consistent results with clinical trials.
Our finding that persons with SBP levels of 150 mm Hg or
higher may have poorer cognitive outcomes is consistent with
the findings of a recent study examining participants en-
rolled in the National Institutes of Health–National Institute
on Aging Alzheimer Disease Centers.23 In that study, persons
60 years of age or older with normal cognition at baseline and
a consistently elevated SBP of 150 mm Hg or higher had a

 steeper decline on the Mini-Mental State Examination during
a 3-year follow-up period than did persons with lower SBP tar-
gets. The present study extends that to a longer follow-up and
demonstrates the importance of lower treatment targets in an
even older segment of the population.
Conflictingguidelineshavebeenissuedregardingtheman-
agement of hypertension in older adults, with the main con-
cern being that lower targets are linked to poorer cognitive per-
formance. These concerns have led to a higher SBP target
recommendation for elderly patients. However, the results of
SPRINT7 have suggested that, from a cardiovascular perspec-
tive,thislinkmaynotbecompletelyaccurate.Thepresentstudy
suggeststhattargetSBPlevelsoflowerthan140mmHgandpos-
sibly120mmHgorlowerextendtocognitiveoutcomesaswell.
These issues are critical for defining the concept of blood pres-
surecontrol,forclinicalguidelinesandrecommendationsaswell
as for quality-based assessments of health care.
The findings of the present study suggest that a lower SBP
target for black patients is linked to greater cognitive benefit.
Almost all guidelines have recommended that target blood
pressuresbesimilarforblackandwhitepatients.Arecentstudy
reported that, for the same blood pressure level, self-
reported cognitive limitations are higher in black patients.14
That study also identified an association between cognitive
symptoms and increased mortality. Future recommenda-
tions for the management of hypertension and cognitive out-
comes need to take this racial disparity into consideration. Our
findingwasindependentofcardiovasculardisease,stroke,and
other risk factors. Although statistical adjustment does not
completely discount the role these factors played in the asso-
ciations between hypertension and cognition, these data sug-
gest a race-specific risk for the development of cognitive
decline from hypertension beyond these factors. Further in-
vestigations into other mechanisms based on prior literature,
such as cerebrovascular changes, inflammation, or oxidative
stress, may be warranted in black patients with hyperten-
sion. We unexpectedly observed a slower rate of decreasing
DSST scores among black participants, especially among those
with lower SBP levels after adjusting for other risk factors.
These trends may be related to the greater impact of lower SBP
levels in this group. These observations need to be replicated
in other cohorts and confirmed by clinical trials.
Although we found statistical significance in these analy-
ses, the magnitude of the change over the 10-year period was
small. Nevertheless, we did not observe an association be-
tween lower targets and cognition that was significantly det-
rimental. This analysis, which was specifically conducted for
olderadultsreceivingtreatmentforhypertension,providesthe
additional suggestion that the potential for a detrimental cog-
nitive outcome of a target SBP lower than 140 or 120 mm Hg is
not substantiated with appropriately designed analyses of ob-
servational data.
Strengths and Limitations
Theadvantagesofthisstudyarethelong-termfollow-up;thesta-
tistical modeling of the change over time in blood pressure, co-
variates,andcognition;andthelargenumberofblackparticipants
in the sample, allowing us to test for racial differences. A limi-
tation of these analyses is the observational nature of the study
design. Differences in classes of antihypertensive medications
andthedegreeofblood-pressureloweringthatphysiciansmight
pursue, especially in the racial comparisons, are important fac-
tors to consider when interpreting these results. Also, observa-
tionalstudiesofdrugeffectshaveasignificantbiasbyindication
related to the initiation of treatment. We have minimized that
biasbyexcludinguntreatedindividuals.Nevertheless,residual
confounding is a limitation that is unavoidable in any observa-
tional analysis. Furthermore, in our analyses, we adjusted for

Conclusions
This analysis of 10-year data from older adults receiving treat-
ment for hypertension in the Health ABC study suggests that
lower SBP levels are associated with greater cognitive protec-
tion. The lower targets may offer greater protection for older
black adults with hypertension. Future guidelines need to con-
sider this racial difference when reviewing or providing rec-
ommendations for management of hypertension.
