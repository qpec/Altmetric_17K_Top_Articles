Introduction
Preeclampsia and FGR are 2 of the “great obstetrical syndromes” (1). These disorders cause short-term 
complications for the infant and have been associated with a range of diseases in adult life, such as ischemic 
heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and long-term neurodevelopmental disorders (2). Moreover, these com-
plications have profound effects on maternal morbidity and mortality. Preeclampsia is one of the leading 
causes of maternal death globally, and both preeclampsia and FGR are markers for the mother’s later risk 
of cardiovascular disease (3). Both preeclampsia and FGR are associated with abnormal placental function 
and metabolism (4). Currently, the placental mechanisms leading to preeclampsia and FGR are only par-
tially understood. It is also unknown why placental dysfunction can lead to preeclampsia without FGR in 
one woman and FGR without preeclampsia in another. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that 
fetal sex is associated with different patterns of ultrasonic markers of placentation (5), placental pathology 
(6), the risk of perinatal death (7–10), and the risk of preeclampsia (11, 12), but the mechanisms underlying 
these differences are unknown. Given these observations, we hypothesized that the placenta would exhibit 
sex-related differences across multiomic analyses. Moreover, we hypothesized that sex-related differences 
in placental function would be associated with the risk of placentally related complications of human preg-
nancy. We tested these hypotheses using 3 discovery-based methods, namely analysis of the placental tran-
scriptome, the placental methylome, and the mother’s serum metabolome. We then used targeted in vitro 
experiments in primary cultures of human trophoblast cells to confirm sex-related differences in function.
Preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction (FGR) are major causes of the more than 5 million 
perinatal and infant deaths occurring globally each year, and both are associated with placental 
dysfunction. The risk of perinatal and infant death is greater in males, but the mechanisms are 
unclear. We studied data and biological samples from the Pregnancy Outcome Prediction (POP) 
study, a prospective cohort study that followed 4,212 women having first pregnancies from 
their dating ultrasound scan through delivery. We tested the hypothesis that fetal sex would be 
associated with altered placental function using multiomic and targeted analyses. We found 
that spermine synthase (SMS) escapes X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) in the placenta and is 
expressed at lower levels in male primary trophoblast cells, and male cells were more sensitive to 
polyamine depletion. The spermine metabolite N1,N12-diacetylspermine (DiAcSpm) was higher 
in the female placenta and in the serum of women pregnant with a female fetus. Higher maternal 
serum levels of DiAcSpm increased the risk of preeclampsia but decreased the risk of FGR. To our 
knowledge, DiAcSpm is the first maternal biomarker to demonstrate opposite associations with 
preeclampsia and FGR, and this is the first evidence to implicate polyamine metabolism in sex-
related differences in placentally related complications of human pregnancy.

Results
Sex-related transcriptome differences are driven by genes escaping XCI in the placenta. We recruited nulliparous 
women to a study that involved serial antenatal blood sampling, blinded ultrasound scans, and postpartum 
placental sampling and followed 4,212 participants from early pregnancy through birth (Table 1) (13). 
We compared the placental transcriptome profile of 67 male and 64 female healthy placentas using RNA 
sequencing (RNA-seq). We collected about 100 M single-end 125 base reads from each subject (Supple-
mental Table 1; supplemental material available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.
insight.120723DS1). A multidimensional scaling plot demonstrated profound clustering of the placental 
transcriptome by fetal sex (Figure 1A). After exclusion of Y chromosome genes, we observed a highly sig-
nificant enrichment of differentially expressed genes on the X chromosome over the autosomes (P = 1.8 × 
10–42; Figure 1B and Supplemental Table 2). Using the previously described threshold of a 10% difference 
in male/female transcript abundance (plus a P < 0.01 threshold, see Methods for details) (14, 15), we iden-
tified 60 X chromosome genes with sex-biased expression in the placenta (Supplemental Table 3): 47 were 
female-biased and 13 were male-biased. We analyzed the publicly available RNA-seq dataset from 19 other 
human tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project (16, 17). The average number of X 
chromosome genes with female-biased expression was 27 (range 12–37, Supplemental Table 3), and 22 of 
the X chromosome genes exhibiting female-biased expression in the placenta did not exhibit female-biased 
expression in any of these other tissues (Figure 2 and Supplemental Table 4) (18).
Female-biased expression of X chromosome genes is commonly due to escape from X-chromosome 
inactivation (XCI) (19). Of the 47 female-biased genes in the placenta, only 19 had previously reported 
to escape from XCI (14, 15), and the other 28 were classified either as inactivated, variable, or unknown 
(Figure 2C and Supplemental Table 3). Unlike in the mouse, XCI in the human placenta is not par-
ent-of-origin specific (20), and direct assessment of biallelic expression of X chromosome genes is not 
possible using analysis of mRNA from whole tissue biopsies. However, identifying genes that escape 
XCI is also informed by analysis of DNA methylation (19); escaped genes do not exhibit sex-related 
differences in promoter methylation, whereas the promoter regions of genes subject to XCI are generally 
hypermethylated in females. Therefore, we compared promoter methylation in healthy male and female 
placental samples using whole genome oxidative bisulphite DNA-seq (Figure 3A). Both the known and 
potentially novel placenta-specific escaped genes had similar levels of promoter methylation in male and 
female tissues, whereas genes without sex-biased expression demonstrated promoter hypermethylation 
in females. An analogous pattern was also observed in male-biased X chromosome genes, which exhib-
ited promoter hypermethylation in females. We replicated these results in a further group of male and 
female samples using SureSelectXT Methyl-Seq (Agilent) (Figure 3, B and C, and Supplemental Tables 5 
and 6). These findings indicated that the placenta had a unique profile of genes escaping XCI compared 
with other human tissues. 
Maternal serum levels of  DiAcSpm differ by fetal sex and pregnancy complications. We next analyzed metab-
olomic data obtained using nontargeted ultra–high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem 
mass spectrometry (MS/MS) of serial serum samples collected at 12, 20, 28, and 36 weeks of gestational 
age (wkGA) from a random sample of healthy pregnant women from our cohort (n = 279) and compared 
the results in relation to fetal sex. The metabolomic profile quantified 837 metabolites of known struc-
tural identity. We performed mixed effects regression analysis of metabolite levels across the 12, 20, and 
28 wkGA samples, a potential indicator of fetoplacental synthesis. We included fetal sex interactions 
with gestational age in the models to identify differences between the metabolite levels in relation to fetal 
sex (Table 2). We then validated candidate metabolites that appeared to vary by fetal sex using serum 
samples from the same women obtained at 36 wkGA. This approach identified 2 circulating metabolites 
with different maternal serum concentration according to the sex of the fetus: 16-OH-dehydroepiandro-
stenedione sulfate (DHEAS) was lower when the fetus was female, whereas N1,N12-diacetylspermine 
(DiAcSpm) was higher when the fetus was female (Figure 4). In both cases, the sex-related difference in 
maternal serum concentrations was consistent with increased mRNA levels of metabolic enzymes in the 
female placenta (Supplemental Table 3). Lower DHEAS in women pregnant with a girl was consistent 
with higher expression of steroid sulfatase (STS) in the female placenta. Higher DiAcSpm in women 
pregnant with a girl was consistent with higher placental expression of spermine synthase (SMS) in the 
female placenta. Both STS and SMS are X chromosome genes, and in the placenta, both escape from 
XCI (Supplemental Table 6).

Characteristics of (a) the participants included in the analysis of metabolites at 36 weeks of gestational age by outcome status and (b) all women 
included in the Pregnancy Outcome Prediction study. Data are expressed as median (IQR) or n (%) as appropriate. For fields where there is no category 
labeled “missing”
, data were 100% complete. Maternal age was defined as age at recruitment. All other maternal characteristics were defined by self-
report at the 20-week questionnaire, from examination of the clinical case record, or linkage to the hospital’s electronic databases. Socioeconomic status 
was quantified using the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) 2007, which is based on census data from the area of the mother’s postcode. Birth weight 
centiles and the SGA (<10th centile) definition are based on the British 1990 population (53). Only term births are included in the PE, FGR, and control 
(healthy women) groups. The definitions of PE, FGR, and Control are given in the Supplemental Methods. There were 9 participants who had both PE and 
FGR, and these are included in both groups. PE, preeclampsia; FGR, fetal growth restriction; FTE, full-time education; DM, denotes diabetes mellitus.

We then sought to determine whether the risk of placentally related complications of pregnancy var-
ied according to maternal serum levels of the 2 sex-related metabolites. We compared the risk of subse-
quent delivery with a diagnosis of preeclampsia (n = 134) or subsequent delivery of a baby with FGR (n = 
162), with reference to 259 controls, across quintiles of DHEAS and DiAcSpm. There was no association 
between maternal serum DHEAS and the risk of either outcome (Supplemental Figure 1). However, the 
risk of preeclampsia increased ~5-fold, and the risk of FGR declined ~5-fold across quintiles of maternal 
serum levels of DiAcSpm (Figure 5A). Both associations were highly statistically significant (P = 2.5 × 10–6 
and 1.1 × 10–6, respectively) and were unaffected by adjustment for the soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 
receptor 1 to placental growth factor ratio (sFLT1:PlGF, an existing placental biomarker for preeclampsia; 
refs. 21, 22), the sex of the fetus, and maternal characteristics (Figure 5, B–D). When the cases were strati-
fied by phenotype, the association was strongest in the group of most severe FGR (Figure 5C). In contrast, 
the association did not differ comparing severe and nonsevere preeclampsia (Figure 5D). Collectively, the 
multiomics approach identified the polyamine pathway as differing by fetal sex and being differentially 
associated with the 2 major placentally related complications of human pregnancy. Therefore, we next set 
out to study this pathway to determine whether there was functional evidence indicating a role in sex-re-
lated differences in the human placenta.
Sex-related differences in the effects of  polyamine depletion in trophoblast cells. The RNA-seq data indicat-
ed that SMS mRNA was ~25% higher in the female placenta compared with the male (Figure 6A and 
Supplemental Table 3). IHC localized the protein to the trophoblast layer of the placental villi (Figure 
6B), and we confirmed higher levels of SMS protein in females using Western blot analysis of primary 
trophoblast cells (Figure 6C). We performed liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and 
studied the concentration of polyamines and their acetylated metabolites in relation to fetoplacental 
sex. The concentration of DiAcSpm was higher in the female placenta, consistent with the maternal 
serum metabolomics (Figure 6D). The functional importance of sex-related differences in placental 
polyamine metabolism was assessed by comparing the effect of the global polyamine synthesis inhibitor 
difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) on the viability of primary cultures of male versus female tropho-
blast cells. We found that male trophoblast cells were more sensitive to this drug than female cells (Fig-
ure 7, A and B). This demonstrated that the placenta-specific escape of SMS from XCI was associated 
with lower levels of SMS protein and SMS metabolites in male trophoblast cells and that male cells 
were more susceptible to the harmful effects of polyamine depletion.
Discussion
The key findings we report here are that differences in placental polyamine synthesis exist in male and 
female placentas and that this pathway is implicated in the pathophysiology of placentally related com-
plications of human pregnancy. We used a multiomic approach to identify this pathway. We studied the 
placenta using RNA-seq and oxidative bisulfite DNA-seq, and we studied maternal serum using metab-
olomics. This approach identified 2 pathways that differed according to fetal sex. We then compared 
the levels of the associated metabolites in maternal serum in relation to the risk of preeclampsia and

fetal growth restriction. A single metabolite, DiAcSpm, was found to differ both in relation to fetal sex 
and the risk of placentally related complications of pregnancy. We then performed targeted experiments 
using primary culture of human trophoblast cells, which confirmed sex-related differences in the cellu-
lar effects of pharmacological interruption of the pathway. We conclude that placental sex is associated 
with differences in polyamine metabolism and that this variation may contribute to the known associa-
tions between fetoplacental sex and the “great obstetrical syndromes” (1).
Preeclampsia and FGR share a number of associations with biomarkers of placental function, 
including low first trimester of pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), high second trimes-
ter α-fetoprotein (AFP) in maternal serum (23), and high resistance patterns of uterine artery Doppler 
flow velocimetry (24, 25). However, DiAcSpm is the first circulating maternal factor to our knowledge 
to demonstrate opposite associations with the 2 conditions. In the present analysis, 2 serum metabolites 
were identified from the 837 known metabolites included in the assay. The basis for their selection was 
very strong statistical evidence that they varied by sex. The probability that, in the absence of associ-
ation between DiAcSpm and the 2 complications (preeclampsia and FGR), we would have produced 
results suggesting an association this strong or stronger was in the region of 1 in 1,000,000 for both 
outcomes, far below the conventional 1 in 20 threshold for statistical significance. Moreover, the 5-fold

variation in the risk of each outcome comparing women with the lowest 20% of serum levels with 
women with the highest 20% of serum levels reflects a clinically important and biologically meaning-
ful difference in risk. Our previous studies of the cohort have demonstrated that the maternal serum 
sFLT1:PlGF ratio is elevated at 36 wkGA in women who subsequently experience either condition, i.e., 
preeclampsia or FGR without any hypertensive complications (21, 26). The ratio is thought to reflect 
placental oxidative stress, which is considered to be a feature of both conditions. The fact that the asso-
ciation between maternal serum levels of DiAcSpm was positive for preeclampsia but negative for FGR 
suggests that the ratio does not merely reflect some underlying feature common to both conditions, such 
as placental hypoxia. Indeed, the opposite associations suggest that the polyamine pathway may deter-
mine whether placental dysfunction results in preeclampsia, FGR, or both conditions concurrently. 
Unfortunately, the number of cases affected by both FGR and preeclampsia where metabolomics data 
were also available was too small for meaningful analysis. Similarly, there were insufficient numbers 
of intrauterine fetal deaths for study, and both of these are areas for future research. It also remains to 
be established whether any effects are local to the placenta or reflect systemic effects on the mother. A 
protective effect of SMS activity on FGR is supported by the phenotype of SMS deficiency in humans

~500 g less than the population average of 3,300 g (29).
The mechanisms leading to XCI are still only partially understood. The causes of tissue specificity 
also remain obscure. The fact that a gene might escape XCI in one tissue but not in another suggests that 
there might be tissue-specific regulatory factors. The majority of the genes that escaped XCI in the pla-
centa are associated with transcriptional and translational modifications. These include zinc finger pro-
teins (ZFX, ZRSR2, ZMAT1) and histone deacetylases (KDM5C, KDM6A, HDAC8), which regulate gene 
expression, as well as eukaryotic initiation factors (EIF2S3, EIFAX) and ribosomal proteins (RPS4X), 
which mediate protein translation. This suggests that genes that escape XCI may drive placental sex–
specific responses under basal conditions or in response to environmental stimuli. However, further 
studies will have to address why, for example, SMS escapes XCI in the placenta but not in other tissues. 
Interestingly, we have recently shown sex-related differences in autosomal genes, where differential 
methylation of CUB And Sushi Multiple Domains 1 (CSMD1) was associated with a placenta-specific 
transcript and a placenta-specific sex-related difference in mRNA levels (30). Better understanding of 
the determinants of sex-related differences in the placenta might shed further light on key pathways 
involved in the pathophysiology of disease.
The current findings can also be interpreted in the light of current theories in evolutionary biology. 
Trivers and Willard postulated that there is a survival advantage to investment of resources in female 
over male offspring when resources are constrained in pregnancy (31). Our findings could be interpreted 
in light of this hypothesis — specifically, that placental escape of the SMS gene from XCI may enhance 
polyamine metabolism and confer a survival advantage to female fetuses developing with suboptimal 
placental function, given our discovery of a protective effect of higher DiAcSpm levels on FGR. The 
finding of associations in opposite directions between DiAcSpm and preeclampsia (positive associa-
tion) and DiAcSpm and FGR (negative association) is particularly interesting. The 2 conditions share 
many common features, but it is currently unclear why placental dysfunction can lead to preeclampsia 
without FGR or FGR without preeclampsia. The current data indicate that placental polyamine metab-
olism may have a role. Haig (32) hypothesized that preeclampsia may be an adaptive response that 
allows the fetus to increase its share of resources by inducing maternal hypertension. This hypothesis 
would predict the existence of factors that increase the risk of preeclampsia but decrease the risk of 
FGR, and maternal serum DiAcSpm demonstrated exactly that pattern of association.
Polyamines (putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) are involved in multiple key processes implicated 
in many disease states, including stem cell function, autophagy, tumor suppression, immunoregulation, 
and both cardio- and neuro-protection (reviewed in ref. 33). Polyamines are synthesized by cells from 
amino acid precursors, but other sources include dietary intake and the intestinal microbiota. Dietary

and 28 wkGA) and n = 131 (36 wkGA); pregnancies with male fetuses were n = 133 (12, 20, and 28 wkGA) and n = 128 (36 wkGA), respectively. Fetal sex 
differences at any of the first 3 gestational ages (composite hypothesis) were tested using a χ2 test and at 36 wkGA using a t test. Two-sided P value 
for the male/female difference was 0.0084 at 12, 20, and 28 wkGA and 0.0049 at 36 wkGA for DiAcSpm levels, and 0.0002 at 12, 20, and 28 wkGA 
and 0.0014 at 36 wkGA for DHEAS levels.

supplementation of mice with spermidine increased longevity (34), and the potential benefits of dietary 
supplementation with polyamines is an area of intense interest in multiple pathological conditions. Inter-
estingly, the human placenta had the highest ratio of SMS to spermidine synthase activity when com-
pared across a range of human tissues (35). However, we provide the first evidence to our knowledge that 
the placenta exhibits a unique sex-dependent difference in polyamine metabolism, which is associated 
with placental-specific escape from XCI by SMS. Given our findings that maternal serum levels of poly-
amine metabolites differ by fetal sex and strongly differentially associate with the great obstetrical syn-
dromes, understanding the effects of polyamine metabolism on placental function is an important area 
for future research. These associations could be of practical significance through the potential for dietary 
manipulation of polyamine metabolism.
Methods
Study design
The Pregnancy Outcome Prediction (POP) study was conducted at the Rosie Hospital (Cambridge, 
United Kingdom), as previously described (13, 36). In brief, it was a prospective cohort study of nul-
liparous women attending the hospital for their dating ultrasound scan between January 14, 2008, and 
July 31, 2012, with a viable singleton pregnancy. Women had blood taken at the booking visit (~12 
wkGA) and at 3 subsequent visits at the NIHR Cambridge Clinical Research Facility (at ~20 wkGA,

were blinded to the results of the research ultrasound scans. The characteristics of the study cohort (n = 
4,212) by outcome status are described in Table 1.
RNA-seq data processing and analysis
Extraction of total RNA from placental biopsies and library preparation for RNA-seq are described in 
the Supplemental Methods.
Alignment of  reads and quantification of  transcript abundance. Reads were trimmed using cutadapt (37) 
and Trim Galore! (38) and were mapped to the GRCh37 (hg19) version of human genome reference. The 
so-called 2-pass (or 2-scan) alignment protocol was applied to rescue unmapped reads from the initial map-
ping step using TopHat2 (39), a splice-aware mapper built on top of Bowtie2 short-read aligner (40, 41). 
The initial and second mapped reads were merged by SAMtools (42), and the uniquely mapped reads were 
counted by the htseq-count of HTSeq (43) using the ENSEMBL version 75 (GENCODE 19) transcriptome 
definition. Transcript abundance was measured in fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped 
reads (FPKM), and the expression fold change was measured using DESeq2 Bioconductor package (44).
Identification of  sex-biased genes and tissue-wide comparison. The RNA-seq data from GTEx analysis ver-
sion V6p (16) were downloaded from https://gtexportal.org/home/datasets. Samples satisfying the fol-
lowing attributes were used: (a) mapping rate (SMMAPRT) > 0.9; (b) exonic rate (SMEXNCRT) > 0.8; 
and (c) mean coverage per-base (SMMNCPB) > 20. Tissues having at least 20 qualifying samples of both

sexes were used, and tissue subtypes were manually selected if 2 or more were available. Additionally, 
sex-specific tissues were removed from the analysis: cervix, fallopian tube, ovary, prostate, testis, uterus, 
vagina, and breast. A total of 3,077 GTEx sample IDs selected in the final 19 tissues were analyzed in 
this study. Our and the GTEx data were analyzed applying the same settings in DESeq2. Chromosome Y 
genes were excluded from the analysis. We identified female-biased genes on chromosome X meeting the 
following criteria: (a) mean read-count > 10, (b) fold change > 10% (i.e., more than 10% increase in females 
compared with males), and (c) Benjamini-Hochberg (45) adjusted P < 0.01 (corrected for the number of the 
chromosome X genes from the original P values). The X chromosome genes with sex-biased expression in 
placental and the 19 GTEx tissues included in this study are listed in Supplemental Table 3.
Placental methylome analysis
DNA extraction from placental biopsies is described in the Supplemental Methods.
Whole genome oxidative bisulfite sequencing (WGoxBS). Placental genomic DNA samples (4 μg) from 
4 healthy pregnancies (n = 2/each fetal sex) were fragmented into 10 Kb fragments with the g-TUBE 
(Covaris) and concentrated using GeneJET purification columns (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Part of 
this fragmented DNA (1.5 μg/sample) was taken forward for oxidation + bisulfite treatment using the 
TrueMethyl kit (Cambridge Epigenetix). Bisulfite converted DNA (50 ng/sample) was used as input for 
library generation using the EpiGnome Methyl-Seq Kit (Epicentre) and EpiGnome Index PCR Primers 
(Epicentre). Indexed libraries were pooled in an equimolar ratio. To increase the number of uniquely 
sequenced reads, 2 independent libraries were generated for each individual. Multiplexed sequencing was 
carried out on the Illumina MiSeq and HiSeq2500 instruments with 2 × 100, 2 × 150 and 2 × 125 cycles 
using MiSeq Reagent Kit v3, HiSeq SBS kit v3, and HiSeq SBS kit v4, respectively. The methylation 
conversion rate was checked with bsExpress (https://bitbucket.org/cegx-bfx/cegx_bsexpress_docker).
In-solution target capture library preparation and sequencing. Placental genomic DNA (3.5 μg) was extracted from 
8 healthy pregnancies. The samples were n = 4/each fetal sex and included 2 samples analyzed by WGoxBS. 
Therefore, 2 samples represented a technical validation experiment, and 6 samples represented a biological/
technical validation experiment (using a different technique and another set of samples). The genomic DNA

was estimated using a longitudinal linear mixed model with the Kenward-Roger denominator degrees of freedom method; a 2-sided exact P value 
accounting for small-sample bias was obtained.

was fragmented using the Covaris S220 system and processed according to the SureSelect Methyl-Seq target 
enrichment protocol (Agilent). All 8 libraries were pooled and sequenced on 1 lane of the Illumina HiSeq2500 
(2 × 125 cycles using HiSeq SBS kit v4) and 1 lane of the Illumina HiSeq4000 (2 × 150 cycles using HiSeq 
3000/4000 SBS kit) following Illumina’s guidelines.
Analysis of  methylation sequencing data. WGoxBS and in-solution target capture data had adapt-
er sequences removed and the quality assessed using Trim Galore! and FastQC (46), respectively. 
High-quality trimmed reads (i.e., base quality ≥ 20) were mapped to the human genome reference 
(hg19) using Bismark (47). After removing reads with poor mapping quality (MAPQ = 0) and dupli-
cated reads, methylated CpGs were called using Bis-SNP (48). CpGs with at least 10× coverage were 
considered in the analysis. The summary statistics for the WGoxBS and in-solution target capture data 
processing are available in Supplemental Table 5. The methylation levels of individual CpG sites were 
measured by the ratio of reads with methylation (i.e., C-base reads) out of the total number of reads 
covering the position (i.e., sum of C and T reads). The methylation levels of promoter regions (1,000 
bp upstream and 1,000 bp downstream regions of the transcript start sites) were measured if there were 
at least 4 CpGs (≥10×) by weighting individual methylation levels as follows: the sum of reads with 
methylation out of the total number of reads over the promoter region. Sex-specific methylation differ-
ences at the promoter regions of chromosome X genes are available in Supplemental Table 6. Promoter 
methylation analysis of X chromosome genes in male and female placentas was performed comparing 
genes subject to XCI, escaped from XCI (divided in genes uniquely identified in placenta or identified 
in at least 1 of 19 GTEx tissues), and with male-biased expression. Statistical analysis was performed 
using Mann-Whitney U tests and Kruskal-Wallis rank tests.
Primary human trophoblast cell culture, Western blotting of SMS, and DFMO treatments
Human placental tissues were collected from healthy women with normal-term pregnancies and scheduled 
for delivery by elective cesarean section following written informed consent. Primary trophoblast cells were 
isolated as described in the Supplemental Methods.
Cells were harvested for Western blot analysis of SMS at 90 hours, after differentiation into syncy-
tiotrophoblasts (Supplemental Methods). Membranes were probed with rabbit anti-SMS primary anti-
body (0.5 μg/ml, Abcam, ab156879) and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody 
(1:2000, Cell Signaling Technology, 7074), followed by β-actin (0.1 μg/ml, Abcam, ab8229). Target 
protein level was normalized to β-actin (Image J software), and the mean density of bands from male 
samples were assigned an arbitrary value of 1. Membranes were also stained for total protein using 
Amido Black Stain (Sigma). The results did not differ when corrected for β-actin or total protein stain-
ing (data not shown).
To analyze the effects of polyamine depletion on cell viability, after 66 hours in culture, trophoblast 
cells were incubated for 24 hours in the presence of DFMO (1–20mM) or vehicle (H2O) in media with 
reduced serum (1% FBS) and 1 mM aminoguanidine to inhibit serum amine oxidase activity (49). The 
viability of trophoblast cells was determined by their ability to metabolize 4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-di-
phenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, MilliporeSigma). Briefly, cells were incubated with 1 mg/ml of MTT 
reconstituted in PBS for 4 hours at 37°C, lysed with 10% SDS, and absorbance read at 570 nm.
SMS IHC in human term placenta
IHC was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded placental sections as described in the Supplemen-
tal Methods, using rabbit anti-SMS (1:20 dilution) or anti–rabbit IgG (1:20 dilution, Abcam, ab172730), 
followed by biotin-conjugated anti rabbit secondary antibodies (1:200, Dako, E0432) and Vectastain ABC 
kit (Vector Labs, PK-6100).
LC-MS
LC-MS was performed on placental biopsies lysed in PBS and 10% of spermidine-(butyl-d8) trihydro-
chloride internal standard (Supplemental Methods). Chromatographic separation was achieved using 
an ACE Excel 2 C18-PFP LC-column with a Shimadzu UPLC system (Shimadzu UK Limited). MS 
detection was performed on an Exactive orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operat-
ing in positive ion mode.

Serum metabolomic profiling
Measurements and analyses. Serum metabolites were measured at Metabolon Inc. by nontargeted ultra–
high-performance LC-MS and MS/MS (50), resulting in the identification of 837 compounds of known 
structural identity. Peaks were quantified using AUC of primary MS ions. Samples were run in batches of 
36, and all batches contained the same proportions of cases and controls. All samples from a given woman 
were run in the same batch. Missing values were assumed to be the result of falling below the detection 
sensitivity and, thus, were imputed with the minimum detection value based on each metabolite. To adjust 
for instrument batch effects for each run day, the raw ion counts for each metabolite were divided by the 
median value for the run day. Hence, metabolites were expressed as multiples of the median, and we called 
this relative abundance in Figure 4.
A case-cohort design was applied (see below). Sex differences in the metabolomic profiles were assessed 
in a random subcohort, excluding cases (n = 279). We fitted longitudinal linear mixed models to identify 
metabolites that changed in the maternal circulation with advancing gestational age up to 28 wkGA dif-
ferentially by fetal sex. Scaled imputed metabolite values (multiples of the median) were log-transformed 
before the analysis. We chose the top 10 metabolites differing by fetal sex with the lowest P values from the 
composite χ2 test (2-sided). We then validated the result using the metabolite level at 36 wkGA from the same 
women by fitting a regression model between the metabolite and fetal sex. We selected the metabolites with 
validation P < 0.01 for further analysis (Table 2). The distributions of the selected metabolites (DiAcSpm 
and DHEAS) were examined in noncases, and the best transformations were applied. Quintiles of DiAc-
Spm and DHEAS were calculated for all women at 36 wkGA, based on the distribution in the noncases. The 
association between the outcomes and the quintile of each metabolite was analyzed using logistic regression. 
The quintile was included in the model (a) as a categorical and (b) as a continuous exposure. All associations 
between the metabolite and log-odds of the outcome were approximately linear, and a 2-sided P value for 
linear trend was reported. To obtain the proportion of cases, the noncases were weighted by the inverse of 
the random subcohort sampling fraction (4,177/325 = 12.85). Next, both metabolites were analyzed as con-
tinuous variables. The transformed variables were turned into Z scores. Logistic regression models were fit-
ted between both metabolites at 36 wkGA and the outcome, with and without adjustments for maternal and 
fetal characteristics and the sFLT1:PlGF ratio (Supplemental Methods). Similar analyses were performed 
on maternal serum levels of spermidine (see Supplemental Figure 2, showing no sex or disease associations 
with spermidine levels), while spermine was not included in the metabolomic panel.
Description of  the case-cohort design used in the metabolite analysis. In total, 4,212 women completed the 
POP study. After excluding miscarriages, fetal deaths prior to 23 weeks and terminations (n = 29), and 
women who did not have any blood samples for analysis (n = 6), 4,177 women remained in the cohort.
Ten groups of cases were defined, but only the preeclampsia and FGR cases born at term were included in 
the present study. The groups were (a) preeclampsia with preterm delivery; (b) customized BW centile (<10th) 
(51) with preterm delivery; (c) gestational diabetes requiring drug treatment; (d) gestational diabetes requiring 
diet treatment; (e) spontaneous preterm delivery; (f) severe, nonsuperimposed preeclampsia, term delivery; (g) 
customized BW centile (<10th) with abdominal circumference growth velocity (ACGV) in the lowest decile 
between 20 and 36 wkGA (ACGVD1) (52); (h) severe, superimposed preeclampsia, term delivery; (i) nonse-
vere, nonsuperimposed preeclampsia, term delivery; and (j) customized BW centile (<3rd) delivered at term. 
In total, 644 cases belonged to 1 or more of these groups. For the present study, preeclampsia was defined by 
combining groups f, h, and i (any severe preeclampsia or nonsevere nonsuperimposed preeclampsia), as per 
the ACOG 2013 definition (21), and FGR was defined by combining groups g and j (customized BW centile 
[<3rd] or the combination of customized BW centile [<10th] and ACGVD1). Preterm births were excluded. 
A subcohort of 325 women was randomly selected in the cohort, and 46 of these women developed 1 or more 
of the 10 outcomes. The remaining 279 healthy women were used in the analysis assessing the changes in 
metabolites levels between 12 wkGA and 28 wkGA. The analysis of preeclampsia and FGR was performed 
among women who had the metabolite measurement available at 36 wkGA and gave birth at term. The 
analysis of the outcomes included 134 cases of preeclampsia, 162 cases of FGR (9 of these had also pre-
eclampsia), and a shared comparison group of 259 healthy women. In a further analysis, we stratified FGR 
by phenotype, defined as the combination of (a) customized BW centile between the 3rd and the 10th and 
ACGVD1, (b) customized BW centile (<3rd) and ACGV deciles between the 2nd and 10th (ACGVD2-10), 
and (c) customized BW centile [<3rd] and ACGVD1 (n = 52, n = 79 and n = 31, respectively). Preeclampsia 
was stratified to nonsevere and severe cases (n = 42 and n = 92, respectively).
