Background: The Early Cancer Detection Consortium is developing a blood-test to screen the general population
for early identification of cancer, and has therefore conducted a systematic mapping review to identify blood-
based biomarkers that could be used for early identification of cancer.
Methods: A mapping review with a systematic approach was performed to identify biomarkers and establish
their state of development. Comprehensive searches of electronic databases Medline, Embase, CINAHL, the
Cochrane library and Biosis were conducted in May 2014 to obtain relevant literature on blood-based biomarkers
for cancer detection in humans. Screening of retrieved titles and abstracts was performed using an iterative sift-
ing process known as “data mining”. All blood based biomarkers, their relevant properties and characteristics,
and their corresponding references were entered into an inclusive database for further scrutiny by the
Consortium, and subsequent selection of biomarkers for rapid review. This systematic review is registered
with PROSPERO (no. CRD42014010827).
Findings: The searches retrieved 19,724 records after duplicate removal. The data mining approach retrieved
3990 records (i.e. 20% of the original 19,724), which were considered for inclusion. A list of 814 potential
blood-based biomarkers was generated from included studies. Clinical experts scrutinised the list to identify
miss-classified and duplicate markers, also volunteering the names of biomarkers that may have been missed:
no new markers were identified as a result. This resulted in a final list of 788 biomarkers.
Interpretation: This study is the first to systematically and comprehensively map blood biomarkers for early de-
tection of cancer. Use of this rapid systematic mapping approach found a broad range of relevant biomarkers
allowing an evidence-based approach to identification of promising biomarkers for development of a blood-
based cancer screening test in the general population.

1. Introduction
Early detection of cancer results in improved survival (Etzioni et al.,
2003; Wolf et al., 2010; McPhail et al., 2015). Cancers detected early re-
quire less extensive treatment and are less likely to have spread to other
organs. Cancer diagnosis requires histological examination of tissue ab-
normalities detected by radiological, clinical or endoscopic examination
of patients. Detection, as opposed to diagnosis, relies on screening a
largely asymptomatic population to identify people who may be at
higher risk of having cancer than others. Screening tests for cancer, or
any other condition need to fulfil strict criteria to prevent the imple-
mentation of inappropriate screening, ensuring screening is cost effec-
tive and benefits patients. The criteria applied within the UK are listed
at http://www.screening.nhs.uk/criteria, based on those developed by
Wilson and Jungner (Cochrane & Holland, 1971; Wilson & Jungner,
1968). For early cancer detection, a blood-based screening test would
have to be cost effective and demonstrate a meaningful clinical benefit
which outweighs the harms associated with false positive, indetermi-
nate results and overtreatment. This is clearly a major undertaking,
and needs a multidisciplinary approach.
The Early Cancer Detection Consortium (ECDC) was established in
2012 in the United Kingdom and comprises 23 universities, their associ-
ated NHS hospitals, as well as other organisations and industry partners.
The consortium was established to investigate whether a cost-effective
screening test can be used in the general population to identify people

 with early cancers. Given the extensive literature on blood biomarkers
for cancer, it is logical to explore the development of such a test using
existing biomarkers that have the best evidence-base for cancer detec-
tion. A sensitive blood test for multiple tumour types could enable peo-
ple with biomarker levels which are outside the typical range to receive
further investigation and lead to earlier diagnosis of cancer at an asymp-
tomatic stage when curative treatment is feasible. The next stage of the
programme will involve analytical and clinical validation of these bio-
markers in a case control study, from which a detection algorithm will
be produced and validated for possible use as a generic cancer screen.
Finally, a randomised controlled trial will be required to determine the
clinical and cost-effectiveness of the resulting screening strategy.
Previous reviews in this area have understandably been limited in
scope, usually restricted to one biomarker or well-defined group of po-
tential markers, due to the enormous number of publications in the
field. The aim of this study was therefore to establish the full range of
candidate blood-based biomarkers with potential for the early detection
of cancer, and map key characteristics of the tests.
2. Methods
To identify all relevant biomarkers, comprehensive searches and
innovative methods to perform the mapping review were employed
to cope with the sizeable body of relevant literature to be assessed
within a short time-frame. The mapping review comprised the follow-
ing stages: comprehensive literature searches; data mining techniques
for rapid screening of the search records and; development of a custom-
izable database of evidence to optimise the output from the mapping
review. It was not considered sufficient simply to list evidence by
reference or to name the biomarker once in a spreadsheet and continue
searching until another new biomarker was found. Instead it was more
useful and time-efficient to maintain the corresponding citations for
each biomarker and record the basic characteristics of the study at the
time of screening. This enabled a basic informative profile to be built
for each biomarker identified in the mapping review.
This
systematic
review
is
registered
with
PROSPERO
(no.
CRD42014010827) and the methods have been structured around the
PRISMA checklist (http://www.prisma-statement.org/).
2.1. Eligibility Criteria
Eligible studies included all English language studies from the past
five years that investigated blood based biomarkers in more than 50 pa-
tients, see Table 1.
2.2. Search Strategy
To identify a comprehensive body of literature from which a list
of candidate biomarkers could be generated, a broad search using
keywords and subject headings was undertaken. The terms reflected
the concepts of ‘diagnosis’, ‘markers’, ‘blood’ and ‘screening’ (see
supplementary material). The keywords and subject headings were
developed using a variety of collaborative methods between
Information Specialists and Systematic Reviewers at the University
of Sheffield and researchers at the University of Warwick.
A scoping search was performed and assessed for appropriateness.
Additionally, key journal articles and abstracts in Medline were re-
trieved and assessed to obtain relevant subject headings and keywords.
Clinical input was sought from members of the ECDC to verify and val-
idate the chosen keywords. For the full search, relevant free-text, key-
word and thesaurus terms were combined using Boolean operators
and translated into database specific syntax. Full searches were limited
to English language, humans and publication dated from 2010 to May
2014. The databases searched were Medline and Medline in Process,
Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library (including Cochrane Database of
Systematic Reviews, DARE, CENTRAL, HTA, NHS EED), Science Citation
Index Expanded, Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science,
Book Citation Index – Science, and Biosis Previews.
The initial search strategy was broad and inclusive. As a result, a
large number of relevant records were obtained. Preliminary validation
by consulting experts in the field indicated that the search was sensitive
and no missing relevant literature was identified.
2.3. Sifting and Data Mining
The results of the initial searches were imported into a Reference
Manager database. To identify an exhaustive list of biomarkers, re-
trieved records were searched iteratively within the Reference Manager
database, using keywords to select potentially relevant titles. Titles and
abstracts of this selection of citations were scrutinised for names and
descriptions of biomarkers that met (or potentially met) the selection
criteria (see Table 1). The citations were tagged to indicate that they
had been viewed, to enable their exclusion from further searches. Rele-
vant citations were exported to a Microsoft Access database which was
customised to allow data extraction of relevant key information for each
biomarker that was available from the corresponding study abstracts.
The data mining process within the main database included the fol-
lowing restrictions (see Box 1):
To ensure a comprehensive capture of all relevant biomarkers, a fur-
ther validation stage was performed. Relevant reviews identified during
the search were used to check for additional biomarkers not generated
by the data mining process. ECDC members were invited to recommend
papers that they believed to be relevant to the mapping review.
2.4. Data Collection
Each biomarker occupied a record with a unique identifier number
in a customised Microsoft Access database which stored the number
of associated papers, the abstract and reference details; associated syn-
onyms and acronyms; types of cancers and study design; keywords
used to retrieve the abstract during data mining; assays used to measure
the biomarker, where reported; category to which the biomarker was
assigned (e.g. auto-antibodies); and the sample types used, where re-
ported (e.g. serum, plasma or whole blood).
2.5. Results
After duplicates were removed, 19,724 records were yielded from
the comprehensive searches. Using data mining, 3990 titles and ab-
stracts were retrieved from the 19,724 records for full scrutiny. Data
mining is the process of pulling a subset of records from a large, un-
wieldy dataset. The subset of 3990 abstracts was reviewed in order to
generate a list of biomarkers which are potentially relevant to early
identification of cancer using blood. A full breakdown of the keywords
used and the number of corresponding records retrieved can be seen
in Fig. 1. During the validation process, three relevant reviews were

markers. No further biomarkers were identified either from these re-
views or from the consultation of ECDC members.
A total of 814 biomarkers were identified as potentially relevant to
the review question and were subjected to further scrutiny, identifying
duplicates and miss-classified biomarkers during a process of data
cleaning and categorising the biomarkers into groups or families.
These groups are currently arranged by molecular function in order to
map the biomarkers by biological origin. Further research using this
methodology and database into the empirical application and validation
of each biomarker will allow the biomarkers to be grouped by clinical
utility such as cancer type or platform. However, we have performed
this analysis for colorectal cancer (Table 2) and lung cancer (Table 3)
to illustrate how these data could be used to define cancer-specific bio-
markers. This resulted in a final total of 788 biomarkers, grouped into 13
initial categories (see Supplementary Tables 1–13) as follows:
1. Adhesion and matrix proteins (n = 36). The expression of mole-
cules involved in adhesion or in formation of the connective tissue
matrix around cancer cells differ from non-neoplastic cells and ap-
pear in blood. Early work included collagen breakdown products,
which are produced as a result of increased collagen turnover, but
are not specific to particular tumour types (Paterson et al., 1991;
Berruti et al., 1995). Collagens are metabolised by matrix metallo-
proteinase proteins (MMPs), these in turn are antagonised by tissue
inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs) (Roy et al., 2009).
Both MMPs and TIMPs are represented in this group. Turnover of
other matrix proteins is altered in cancer: vimentin (Ludwig et al.,
2009), laminin (Schechter & Lopes, 1990) and tenascin are included
in the list. Cancer cells have increased motility compared with non-
neoplastic cells, and show altered expression of adhesion mole-
cules. EpCAM, e-cadherin, and e-selectin are represented as blood
biomarkers in the list (Beije et al., 2015; Hauselmann & Borsig,
2014; Gires & Stoecklein, 2014). Following review, a total of 18
were removed, including one duplicate entry.
2. Auto-antibodies and immunological markers (n = 59). The major-
ity of entries in this category relate to auto-antibodies. These have
been described for a wide variety of proteins within cancer, notably
nuclear proteins such as P53 and other nuclear proteins, and occur
in many cancers (Middleton et al., 2014). Immunological markers
of interest include CRP, usually regarded as a marker of
inflammation.
3. Classical Tumour Markers. A total of 23 markers were included in
the ‘classical’ tumour marker group. This includes those used widely
in practice, including CEA, CA125, CA15-3, CA19-9, AFP, and PSA.
Markers of lesser utility, such as LDH and HE4 were also included.
It should be noted that several of these (CA15-3 and CA19-9) refer
to different epitopes of the same antigen, MUC1, which also came
up in our searches.
4. Coagulation & angiogenic proteins. Of the 29 proteins in this
category, the majority had relatively little evidence for their
utility in early cancer detection. The markers can be sub-
categorised into those connected to angiogenesis (e.g. VEGF,
PlGF, Angiopoietins) and coagulation (e.g. plasminogen acti-
vating proteins and kallikreins). Annexins were included in
this group, though they are more often thought of as apopto-
sis associated proteins.
Box 1
Data mining process restrictions.
Restriction
Justification
1. Searches limited to last five
years.
To ensure that the biomarkers
identified and their associated
evidence is current and relevant,
searches were restricted to
records published in the last five
years (from 2010 to May 2014).
2. Data mining technique
employed, as opposed to
screening all references
Data mining involved
interrogation of search results
using relevant keywords (Box 2)
to search within the database of
total records for batches of
references. Keywords were
identified through consultation
with ECDC members for known
technologies, and for other
potentially relevant terms.
Keywords for similar concepts
(e.g. synonyms for a specific
biomarker) were grouped and
searched together. Keywords
expected to retrieve citations of
high relevance were prioritised
over those with less obvious
relevance. Further keywords were
identified by the review team by
consideration of indexing
keywords and content of studies
identified as relevant.
3. One reviewer performed the
data mining.
One reviewer screened the
references to generate the list of
biomarkers using the data mining
technique. A single reviewer
screening approach was
mitigated for by the examination
review papers and consultation
with ECDC membership during a
later validation phase. An
inclusive approach to inclusion
was adopted to minimise
inappropriate exclusions.
4. Pragmatic inclusion criteria
Titles without abstracts were not
included. Equally abstracts of
primary studies or reviews which
did not name a biomarker were
not included. Titles and abstracts
retrieved from each batch of
references associated with each
keyword were assessed against
the eligibility criteria in Table 1.

troscopy (MS); 7. Other biomarkers.

 5. Cytokines, chemokines and insulin-like growth factors. 52
biomarkers were included in this group. They include a
wide range of cytokines and soluble receptors. Evidence for
these is limited, but they represent an interesting group of
proteins abnormal in cancer, measurement of which is likely
to reflect the profound local immune suppression and sys-
temic alteration of immunity present in cancers.
6. Circulating-free DNA. This is usually abbreviated as cfDNA,
though
increasingly
the
term
circulating
tumour
DNA
(ctDNA) is used. While DNA is clearly a single biomarker, 39 in-
dividual biomarkers representing genes or alterations of most
interest were identified in this group, though in essence any
mutation of gene methylation marker identified would be
part of this group. While the first descriptions of cfDNA used

 PCR (Lo, 2001a; Lo, 2001b), many recent papers apply multi-
analyte methods, including next generation sequencing (Coco
et al., 2015; Rothe et al., 2014; Couraud et al., 2014), to the
study of cfDNA to detect mutations of potential diagnostic sig-
nificance. Though as yet few have used this for early detection.
7. Hormones. While 13 biomarkers were assigned to this category,
only Corticosteroid-binding globulin survives more stringent
searches (Wu et al., 2012). Hormone levels are not thought to be re-
liable markers of cancer.
8. Metabolomics. A large number of metabolites are known to be al-
tered in cancer, as the result of changes in energy, lipid, amino
acid, and protein metabolism. We identified 126 individual
markers, many of which were measured in concert by mass spec-
troscopy within several studies (Cross et al., 2014; Hasim et al.,
2013).
9. MicroRNA and other RNAs. There are now over 1000 human miRNA
species known, a large number of these have been studied in cancer.
While the majority have been looked at in tissue, there is consider-
able interest in their possible use as a liquid biopsy, our list of 232
biomarkers in this group reflects this. They are rarely measured
alone: most use some form of array strategies for measurement,
most studies concentrate on single cancer types (Fortunato et al.,
2014; Clancy et al., 2014).
10. Novel Proteins. A large number of protein biomarkers, often identi-
fied by mass spectroscopy or 2D gel electrophoresis, were hard to
categorise. These were grouped as novel proteins and represent a
diverse group of 148 biomarkers. Examples include alpha-2-
heremans-schmid-glycoprotein (AHSG) (Dowling et al., 2012) and
galectin (Gromov et al., 2010) in breast cancer.
11. Nuclear proteins. A group of 13 nuclear protein biomarkers were
assigned to this category, though some markers within the novel
protein group are of nuclear origin. Circulating nucleosomes are
included in this group as they are usually detected by ELISA
(Holdenrieder et al., 2014).
12. Microbial proteins (n = 15). A small number of Epstein-Barr Virus
(EBV) and Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) proteins and their anti-
bodies have been studied as early cancer biomarkers in blood,
based on the detection of EBV DNA in cancer patients (Lo, 2001b).
Helicobacter antibodies also fall into this group.
13. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC). Only three biomarkers, all
small metabolites, were assigned to this category, which it could
be argued forms part of the metabolite group. It is however mea-
sured differently.
3. Discussion
We systematically searched the literature from the last five years to
identify potential blood biomarkers for cancer (Hanahan & Weinberg,
2011; Cree, 2011). The data mining process retrieved 3990 citations
from the initial 19, 724 records, screening the abstracts of these citations
identified 814 biomarkers that may be relevant. After data-cleaning, 788
biomarkers were fitted into 13 categories as described above as having
potential for use as early cancer detection biomarkers present within
blood samples. Biomarkers were grouped by molecular function. Fur-
ther analysis such as grouping by cancer type may be possible only
once the utility of each biomarker has been reviewed independently.
As this is a mapping review, it is not possible to speculate the definitive
clinical utility for each biomarker. Most studies reviewed tended to con-
centrate on single common cancers, and few papers show evidence of a
systematic approach to biomarker discovery but were limited by the
clinical samples and techniques of their laboratories.
The conduct of large systematic reviews is challenging, yet not all
biomedical questions can be reduced to the size where standard meth-
odologies for systematic review are thought reasonable. We have

 therefore taken a data mining approach to map blood biomarkers that
may be suitable for the early detection of cancer using the search tools
available within the reference management software. As with any ap-
proach to reviewing literature that falls short of a full systematic review,
there is a balance between rigour and expenditure of time and re-
sources. In this case, the aim was not to identify all relevant literature
(as would be the case in a systematic review of efficacy), but rather all
relevant biomarkers. It should be noted that the database does not
hold the full text of the articles referenced and is restricted to titles, ab-
stracts and keywords. Full text searching using machine learning algo-
rithms could eventually provide a better solution.
In this instance, to allow a thorough search of the large dataset of
biomarker literature and ensure an efficient approach to managing the
data, we used data mining tools available within the reference manage-
ment software. This allowed us to retrieve potentially relevant records,
extract data relating to relevant biomarkers, and validate the process
through adjunctive searches of reviews and through contact with an ex-
tensive network of experts. While the use of experts to validate the data
may be regarded as subjective, it was a necessary step in validation of
the searches and the multidisciplinary consortium involved in this
work covers a large range of expertise. The limitation to studies pub-
lished after 2009 could have skewed the data towards new technolo-
gies, and therefore reviews were included to mitigate the risk of
ignoring older methodologies. Despite this limitation, it is notable that
proteomic biomarkers, a more mature technology, formed a large pro-
portion of the biomarkers found. Furthermore, it is possible that many
of those biomarkers that have received less attention more recently
did so because they were found to have limited utility in subsequent
studies. We used conservative selection criteria that may have resulted
in the inclusion of irrelevant biomarkers, but will have minimised the
chance of relevant biomarkers being excluded. As such, we are confi-
dent that our methodology is fit for purpose and will have had high sen-
sitivity for the identification of relevant biomarkers.
Limiting the mapping review to abstracts may have excluded studies
identifying multiple potential biomarkers if such biomarkers were only
mentioned in the main text. This is unlikely to occur in the field of
emerging and promising biomarkers where the aim is to highlight the
biomarker and technology to the audience. However, the vagueness of
the abstracts of many papers is a challenge, as is the generally poor qual-
ity of study design. Even some larger scale studies from major groups do
not include controls and few studies were powered to examine multiple
biomarkers in comparison with existing tumour markers. The majority
of cases (when described) are from patients with advanced disease,
and this is a major concern for those interested in early detection:
there is no guarantee that biomarkers identified in patients with ad-
vanced disease are relevant to those with early disease. There is certain-
ly a need to improve the quality of papers on early detection using tools
such as those available from the EQUATOR network (http://
www.equator-network.org).
Our intention is to use the list of biomarkers identified by this re-
view to generate a set of biomarkers that can be subjected to analyt-
ical validation within pathology blood science laboratories, then
clinically validated within a large, prospective, multicentre clinical
study to develop a generic cancer testing strategy for subsequent
clinical trial. The primary aim is to produce a screening test strategy
for cancer that does more good than harm at reasonable cost. Good
includes decreased morbidity and mortality from early detection, di-
agnosis and treatment of cancers, while harm is usually regarded as
significant risk of overdiagnosis, and consequent overtreatment.
The entire strategy needs to be cost effective to achieve eventual ap-
proval from the UK National Screening Committee (NSC), which de-
fines 22 criteria according to the condition, the test, the treatment
and the screening programme (http://www.screening.nhs.uk/
criteria) based on those developed by Wilson & Jungner (1968).
Within the list, there are some interesting results. Firstly, it is clear
that current tumour markers, which considered in isolation, few
would regard as sensible diagnostic tests in patients with a possible di-
agnosis of cancer, are collectively quite good at detection if used concur-
rently. The bulk of the work on this comes from one group in Barcelona
(Molina et al., 2012), with other important contributions from others
(Barak et al., 2010). The validation of biomarkers needs a point of refer-
ence, for direct comparison and it is clear that tumour marker lists used
by Molina et al. (2012) represent such a standard. We would encourage
those active in the field to use this list as their comparator for future
work to allow comparison between studies.
The biomarkers can be grouped by the technology used for their de-
tection. Taken to its logical conclusion, this results in a reduction of the
thirteen groups above to seven groups as outlined in Box 3.
The ability of protein measurement to be multiplexed by immunoas-
say arrays or mass spectroscopy means that all proteins, including auto-
antibodies, can be measured simultaneously. Simple panels with few
analyses tend to be less expensive and have greater potential for high
throughput. DNA and RNA can be detected rapidly and inexpensively
by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technologies, and there is evidence
from multiple studies that the level of cfDNA has potential as a generic
cancer marker. However, PCR is limited in the number of targets that

 can be detected at one time, and by the small amount of material
present in patients with small tumours, which does not permit large
numbers of tests to be performed without recourse to sequencing or
large panels. Sequencing has the potential to detect large numbers of
mutations, adding specificity, and could have utility in reflex testing. It
is currently an expensive option, but costs of sequencing are decreasing
rapidly, while technologies available are improving their capability at
almost the same pace.
Metabolomics is of considerable interest, with a large literature to
support it. While larger molecules require mass spectroscopy to mea-
sure their presence, smaller molecules can be detected in gas phase in
the head space of blood samples using inexpensive sensor technologies.
We believe that this relatively new option may have considerable po-
tential to act as a generic test. There are a number of other tests that
do not fit immediately into one of these seven categories: nucleosome
assays are one such example, and are being used as potential screening
tests.
The concept of combining high sensitivity/low specificity tests with
reflex low sensitivity/high specificity tests to detect cancers early
(Cree, 2011), seems feasible from the results we have obtained. We
need to combine biomarkers with high sensitivity for screening the gen-
eral population with biomarkers of high specificity to determine the rel-
evance of the screening results. The next task is clearly to try this in
practice to determine its real potential for early cancer detection, and
to determine the best analytical methods to process the data for individ-
ual patients. Our preferred strategy is to examine the biomarkers in each
category in greater detail, and undertake direct comparison of these bio-
markers in a large cohort of samples following independent analytical
validation. In our view, the same caveats around retrospective studies
apply to biomarker validation as they do to drug trials: the potential
for bias from sample collections is high and large prospective studies
are necessary. This review is therefore the first step in an ambitious
programme of work which will inevitably require careful evaluation of
clinical, cost and ethical implications at each stage. However, there is
no doubt that if such an approach to early cancer detection proved suc-
cessful, it could be invaluable.
4. Conclusion
This ground-breaking study is the first to systematically and com-
prehensively map blood biomarkers for early detection of cancer and
will inform an innovative research project to identify, validate and im-
plement new generic blood screening tests for early cancer detection
in the general population.
