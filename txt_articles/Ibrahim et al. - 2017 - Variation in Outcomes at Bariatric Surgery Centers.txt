IMPORTANCE In the United States, reports about perioperative complications associated with
bariatric surgery led to the establishment of accreditation criteria for bariatric centers of
excellence and many bariatric centers obtaining accreditation. Currently, most bariatric
procedures occur at these centers, but to what extent they uniformly provide high-quality
care remains unknown.
OBJECTIVE To describe the variation in surgical outcomes across bariatric centers of
excellence and the geographic availability of high-quality centers.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective review analyzed the claims data of
145 527 patients who underwent bariatric surgery at bariatric centers of excellence between
January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2013. Data were obtained from the Healthcare Cost and
Utilization Project’
s State Inpatient Database. This database included unique hospital
identification numbers in 12 states (Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Iowa, Massachusetts,
Maryland, North Carolina, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Washington, and Wisconsin),
allowing comparisons among 165 centers of excellence located in those states. Participants
were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical
Modification codes. Those included in the study cohort were patients with a primary
diagnosis of morbid obesity and who underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, open
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, laparoscopic gastric band placement, or laparoscopic sleeve
gastrectomy. Excluded from the cohort were patients younger than 18 years or who had an
abdominal malignant neoplasm. Data were analyzed July 1, 2016, through January 10, 2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Risk-adjusted and reliability-adjusted serious complication
rates within 30 days of the index operation were calculated for each center. Centers were
stratified by geographic location and operative volume.
RESULTS In this analysis of claims data from 145 527 patients, wide variation in quality was
found across 165 bariatric centers of excellence, both nationwide and statewide. At the
national level, the risk-adjusted and reliability-adjusted serious complication rates at each
center varied 17-fold, ranging from 0.6% to 10.3%. At the state level, variation ranged from
2.1-fold (Wisconsin decile range, 1.5%-3.3%) to 9.5-fold (Nebraska decile range, 1.0%-10.3%).
After dividing hospitals into quintiles of quality on the basis of their adjusted complication
rates, 38 of 132 (28.8%) had a center in a higher quintile of quality located within the same
hospital service area. Variation in rates of complications existed at centers with low volume
(annual mean [SD] procedure volume, 156 [20] patients; complication range, 0.6%-6.4%;
9.8-fold variation), medium volume (annual mean [SD] procedure volume, 239 [27] patients;
complication range, 0.6%-10.3%; 17.5-fold variation), and high volume (annual mean [SD]
procedure volume, 448 [131] patients; complication range, 0.6%-4.9%; 7.5-fold variation).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Even among accredited bariatric surgery centers, wide
variation exists in rates of postoperative serious complications across geographic location and
operative volumes. Given that a large proportion of centers are geographically located near
higher-performing centers, opportunities for improvement through regional collaboratives or
selective referral should be considered.

mproving safety for bariatric surgery has emerged as a na-
tional clinical and policy priority because it is both a com-
mon procedure and associated with substantial periopera-
tiverisk.Morethan196 000bariatricoperationsareperformed
annually in the United States,1 and initial reports prior to any
bariatric accreditation process revealed 30-day mortality rates
as high as 9% in low-volume centers.2 In response, 2 leading
surgical organizations separately established criteria for bar-
iatriccentersofexcellencetohelppayersguidepatientstohigh-
quality centers of care.3-5 Subsequently, many centers under-
went the necessary facility and personnel changes to obtain
accreditation; today, most (>88%) bariatric procedures are per-
formed at accredited centers.6 In 2014, the 2 separate efforts
merged to form the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accredi-
tation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP), which
notonlygrantsaccreditationbutalsofacilitatesoutcometrack-
ing and feedback for bariatric surgeons and centers within the
MBSAQIP.
To what extent accredited bariatric centers uniformly pro-
vide high-quality care remains unknown. The accreditation
process has no direct assessment of risk-adjusted outcomes to
determine center eligibility. Instead, the criteria to become an
accreditedcenterfocusonstructuralrequirements,suchasbar-
iatric operating tables, longer laparoscopic instruments, and
minimum annual case volumes. Although important to the op-
timal care of patients obtaining care at bariatric centers, such
structural elements are only weakly associated with patient
outcomes.7 Because accredited centers care for most of the
patients seeking bariatric surgery, any variation among these
centers may identify opportunities for improvement that can
be addressed through current quality improvement pro-
grams. Moreover, understanding the geographic correlation
between high- and low-quality centers could inform the fea-
sibility of quality improvement strategies (eg, selective refer-
ral, in-network regionalization) that have been proposed for
other surgical procedures.8
In this context, we performed a retrospective review of
claims data of patients who underwent bariatric surgery at ac-
creditedcenterstoidentifythevariationsinpostoperativecom-
plications across these centers. Our findings, based on data ob-
tained prior to the implementation of MBSAQIP, may help
inform how continued progress in quality improvement for
bariatric surgery can be achieved.
Methods
Data Source
We obtained claims data from the Healthcare Cost and Utili-
zation Project’
s State Inpatient Database, which was created
by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.9 This fed-
eral-statedatabaseprovidespatient-leveldataforinpatientdis-
charges from short-term, nonfederal, acute care, general, and
specialty hospitals in participating US states. For this specific
study, data were available from 165 bariatric centers of excel-
lence in 12 states (Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Iowa, Massa-
chusetts,Maryland,NorthCarolina,Nebraska,NewJersey,New
York, Washington, and Wisconsin). The other 38 states either
did not participate in the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Proj-
ect or did not have 3 consecutive years of data available dur-
ing the study period—between January 1, 2010, and Decem-
ber 31, 2013. This study was approved by the University of
Michigan Institutional Review Board and was deemed ex-
empt from review because of the use of secondary data.
Identification of Procedures and Study Cohort
Patients who underwent bariatric procedures between Janu-
ary 1, 2010, and December 31, 2013, were identified using In-
ternational Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical
Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. Included in the study cohort
were patients with a primary diagnosis of morbid obesity
(ICD-9-CM codes 278.0, 278.00, and 278.01) who underwent
laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, open Roux-en-Y
gastric bypass, laparoscopic gastric band placement, or lapa-
roscopic sleeve gastrectomy (ICD-9-CM codes 43.89, 44.3,
44.31, 44.38, 44.39, 44.68, 44.95, 44.96, 44.97, 44.99, 44.5,
45.51, and 45.9). Excluded from the cohort were patients
younger than 18 years or who had an abdominal malignant
neoplasm(ICD-9-CMcodes150.0-159.9or230.1-230.9).Asum-

Outcome Variables
In this study, the primary outcome of interest was the rate of
serious complications, and ICD-9-CM codes for bariatric sur-
gerypopulationswereusedtoidentifycomplications.10,11These
complications fell into the following categories: anastomotic
leak,cardiac,genitourinary,hemorrhagic,neurologic,obstruc-
tion, postoperative shock, pulmonary, splenic injury, throm-
boembolic, wound infection, and reoperation. Serious com-
plications were defined as any of the above complications
requiring a prolonged length of stay greater than the 75th per-
centile for the specific procedure performed. This length-of-
stay criteria has been applied in multiple previous studies to
give clinical face validity (ie, that the complication had a mean-
ingful clinical effect) to the rate of complications and to make
it more specific.12-15
A secondary interest in this study was to assess the geo-
graphic proximity between high-quality and low-quality cen-
ters of excellence. Definitions from the Darthmouth Atlas of
Healthcare16 were applied to assign each center to a hospital
Key Points
Question How much variation in surgical outcomes exists among
bariatric centers of excellence in the United States?
Findings In this analysis of claims data from 145 527 patients who
underwent bariatric procedures, there was a 17-fold variation in
rates of serious complications across accredited bariatric centers
nationally and up to 9.5-fold variation across individual states.
Significant variation was also seen in low-volume,
medium-volume, and high-volume bariatric centers.
Meaning Accreditation alone does not ensure uniform
high-quality care for bariatric procedures, and further quality
improvement efforts should be considered.

 service area. Hospital service areas are local health care mar-
kets for hospital care and are determined by a collection of zip
codessurroundingahospitalthatrepresentsthelocationwhere
most people in that zip code would obtain their care.
Finally, we wanted to understand the extent of variation
that exists across different operative volumes. Hospitals were
divided into terciles on the basis of their annual volume of
bariatric procedures and were labeled “low volume,” “me-
dium volume,” or “high volume.”
Statistical Analysis
The first aim of this study was to determine variation in qual-
ity among centers of excellence for bariatric surgery. To do
so, centers were ranked by their risk-adjusted and reliability-
adjusted rates of serious complications. To accommodate dif-
ferences in case mix (the type of patients and procedures
performed), a multivariable logistic regression model that
accounted for patient age, sex, race, comorbidities (as de-
scribed by Elixhauser et al17 and Southern et al18), and opera-
tion type (eg, sleeve gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass)
was applied to calculate a risk-adjusted rate of serious
complications for each center. To address possible secular
trends, the year of operation was also included in the regres-
sion model. Because operative volume at each center varies
and may contribute to random noise in the observed rates of
complications, a reliability adjustment was also applied. This
approach has been previously described and applied in com-
paring surgical centers.11,19-21 Briefly, the approach uses hier-
archical modeling to “shrink” lower-volume hospitals to-
ward the overall population mean in proportion to the strength
of the hospitals’statistical signal (ie, surgical volume). Thus,
the final rates of complications used to rank hospital quality
were based on risk-adjusted and reliability-adjusted out-
comes, making the ranking a conservative estimate of varia-
tion across the centers.
The second aim of this study was to describe the geo-
graphic availability of higher-quality centers of excellence. To
do so, each center was placed in rank order according to the
center’
s risk-adjusted and reliability-adjusted rate of serious
complications. Centers in the highest complication quintile
were labeled “very low quality” and then ordinally as “low
quality,
” “medium quality,
” or “high quality” until those in the
lowest complication quintile were labeled “very high qual-
ity.
” Availability of a higher-quality bariatric center was deter-
minedbyassessingifthecenterhadanotherfacilityinthesame
hospital service area labeled in a higher quintile of quality.
All reported P values were 2 sided, with P < .05 as a thresh-
old for significance, calculated using a 2-tailed t test. To ad-
just for clustering within hospitals, robust SEs were applied to
all models. All statistical analyses were completed with Stata
software, version 14 (StataCorp).
Results
This study included 145 527 patients who underwent a bariat-
ric procedure; this cohort had a mean (SD) age of 44.6 (12.1)
years and were predominantly women (113 101 [77.7%])
(Table 1). The most common of these procedures was the lapa-
roscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (78 193 [53.7%]), followed
by laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (44 887 [30.8%]). In ad-
dition to a diagnosis of morbid obesity, the most common co-
morbidity conditions were hypertension (80 807 [55.5%]) and
diabetes (44 190 [30.4%]).
Also included in the study were 165 accredited bariatric
centers, nearly all of which (164 [99.4%]) were located in an
urban setting and most of which (117 [70.9%]) were within a
teaching hospital (Table 2). The centers were geographically
diverse,with78(47.3%)locatedintheNortheastand52(31.5%)
in the South. The mean (SD) number of operating rooms in
these centers was 25 (20), and the mean (SD) nursing staff ra-
tio was 7.8 (2.5). Of the 145 527 patients who underwent bar-
iatric procedures, 6970 (4.8%) had a complication and 2367
(1.6%) had a serious complication. The most common com-
plication was postoperative bleeding (2796 [1.9%]). Seventy-
two patients (0.05%) had an in-hospital mortality. Risk

 factors for developing a complication are summarized in the
eTable in the Supplement.
Wide variation in rates of complications at individual cen-
ters of excellence was observed. The risk-adjusted and reli-
ability-adjusted serious complication rates at each of the 165
centers varied 17-fold, ranging from 0.6% to 10.3% (Figure 1).
The top and bottom deciles varied 3.7-fold (top decile, 0.9%;
bottom decile, 3.3%; P < .005). Similar variation was seen at
the state level (Table 3), ranging from 2.1-fold variation (Wis-
consin decile range, 1.5%-3.3%) to 9.5-fold variation (Ne-
braska decile range, 1.0%-10.3%). Variation in rates of compli-
cations existed at centers with low volume (annual mean [SD]
procedurevolume,156[20]patients;complicationrange,0.6%-
6.4%; 9.8-fold variation), medium volume (annual mean [SD]
procedurevolume,239[27]patients;complicationrange,0.6%-
10.3%;17.5-foldvariation),andhighvolume(annualmean[SD]
procedure volume, 448 [131] patients; complication range,
0.6%-4.9%; 7.5-fold variation) (Figure 2). Mean (SD) compli-
cation rates were 1.9% (0.9%) at low-volume centers, 2.0%
(1.0%) at medium-volume centers, and 1.5% (0.3%) at high-
volume centers (P = .31).
The geographic availability of a higher-quality center was
assessed at the state and hospital service area levels. After di-
viding hospitals into quintiles of quality on the basis of their
adjusted complication rates, all states in the study had both
low-qualityhospitalsandhigh-qualityhospitals.Ofthe132hos-
pitals in the lowest 4 quartiles, 38 hospitals (28.8%) had a bar-
iatric center in a higher quintile of quality located within the
same hospital service area.
Discussion
Our study presents 2 principle findings that improve our un-
derstanding of perioperative safety for bariatric surgery at
centers of excellence. First, there was widespread variation in
quality—up to 17-fold between top and bottom performers—
across bariatric centers of excellence in the United States. Simi-
lar to findings by bariatric accreditation programs in other
countries,24 this finding suggests that participation alone in
the Center of Excellence Program did not ensure uniform high-
quality care. Second, a large proportion of lower-performing
centers were often located in the same hospital service area
as higher-performing centers. Such geographic proximity sug-
gests that patients living in most health care markets would
benefit from information about the local bariatric centers in
their area. Given that most bariatric procedures are now per-
formed at accredited centers, wide variation among these cen-
ters suggests that accreditation alone does not discriminate
enough to guide patients to the best centers for care.
Whether bariatric centers of excellence have improved
safety for bariatric procedures has been a matter of debate.
Advocates for centers of excellence note that hospitals with
accreditation have improved their outcomes over time.3,6,25
In contrast, a later study demonstrated that similar improve-
ments were made in non–centers of excellence, and, when
taken together, there are no significant differences in out-
comes between the 2 types of bariatric centers.26 Nonethe-
less, establishing minimum standards and systematically
adhering to best practices are an excellent place to start
improving outcomes across all centers performing bariatric
procedures. The accredited centers model has been widely
adopted, with more than 720 centers having now obtained
accreditation,27 and major private insurers still restrict pay-
ments to these centers. This study helps us move past the
debate by identifying an important opportunity for improve-
ment across accredited centers, where nearly all bariatric pro-
cedures are performed.
The variation in quality seen at bariatric centers may have
multiple explanations, which we attempted to directly ad-
dress in our study. Because all centers have to meet a mini-
mum annual volume requirement (>125 operations per
year), differences in quality are unlikely related to the volume-
outcomeassociationseeninothersurgicalprocedures.28More-
over,bystratifyingcentersbytheiroperativevolume,wefound

eling and still found considerable variation, suggesting that ad-
ditional mechanisms not captured in our administrative data
are at work.
Two other potential mechanisms not captured in our
data may explain the variation in serious complications. The
first may be the skill of the surgeon performing the proce-
dure. Pilot data of direct video observation of experienced
bariatric surgeons found that their technical skill levels

 varied widely.29 Moreover, this skill variation was strongly
associated with rates of postoperative outcomes. The sec-
ond possible explanation for the variation in serious compli-
cations may be inconsistent adherence to bariatric care
pathways. Currently, there is conflicting evidence as to what
extent these pathways are being adopted and if these path-
ways correlate with improved outcomes.30-32 Both surgical
skill and care pathway adherence are active areas of
research that may identify approaches to reduce variation
after bariatric operations.
Our findings have multiple implications for both practice
and policy to improve the safety of bariatric surgery. First, hos-
pital accreditation alone does not ensure uniform high-
quality care. Specifically, because most bariatric procedures
are now performed at accredited centers, patients and payers
can no longer use this designation to identify the highest-
performing hospitals. Second, all the resources and infrastruc-
ture are already in place to identify true centers of excel-
lence. Because the MBSAQIP does collect outcomes, including
serious complications, from all accredited centers, the pro-
gram could readily stratify nearly all bariatric centers into low-
quality, medium-quality, and high-quality performers. Such
information could be valuable for patients who are choosing
a center for bariatric surgery, for surgeons who are identify-
ingqualityimprovementtargets,andforadministratorsoflarge
hospital systems who are optimizing their network service
lines. Third, now that nearly all bariatric centers are enrolled
in MBSAQIP, they can use the program as a platform for wide-
spread quality improvement. The MBSAQIP has launched mul-
tiple efforts to reduce readmissions and enhance recovery
pathways.33,34 Given that the population eligible for bariatric
procedures far outnumbers the available surgeon workforce,
this general improvement approach may be favorable to
selective referral. Whether such widespread quality improve-
ment efforts can reduce the observed variation in serious
complication rates remains to be seen.

 Limitations
These findings should be interpreted in the context of the
study’
s multiple limitations. First, we used administrative data
that are inherently limited in identifying complication codes.
We used multiple strategies to make our coding more sensi-
tive and specific, including using outcomes from the Compli-
cation Screening Project.35,36 In addition, we added a length

 validity.12,13 Second, because of state privacy laws and the
nature of the data available through the Healthcare Cost and
Utilization Project’
s State Inpatient Database, we were able to
examine centers in only 12 states. These states, however, were
geographically diverse with a broad case mix and provided a
representative sample of bariatric centers across the country.
Third, our data set did not allow evaluation of surgeon-level
outcomes. Future studies with this level of specificity may fur-
ther help identify sources and offer explanations for the varia-
tion we observed. Finally, using claims data did not allow us
to measure other important outcomes associated with bariat-
ric procedures, such as patient satisfaction and weight loss.
While these measures are important to studying quality, they
are secondary to the patient safety concerns raised by the peri-
operative complications mentioned here. In contrast, admin-
istrative claims data do carry unique benefits that are central
to this study. Mostly notably, claims data allowed us to gen-
erate a large enough sample to detect meaningful differences
across centers, which other data sources may not be powered
to identify.
Conclusions
This study found widespread variation in postoperative out-
comes among bariatric centers of excellence. As centers and
payers look toward improving care for the bariatric popula-
tion, focus should be aimed at reducing variation where most
proceduresareperformed.Giventhatalargeproportionoflow-
qualitycentersaregeographicallylocatednearhigherperform-
ing centers, opportunities for improvement through selective
referral or regional collaboration should be considered.

Quality Improvement and Accreditation
The Never-Ending Story
Rajesh Aggarwal, MBBS, MA, PhD, FRCS, FRCSC
The Greek philosopher Aristotle considered that “it is fre-
quent repetition that produces a natural tendency.
”1 None is
more true in the complex world of health care, where superior
quality outcomes are often
underpinned by high case-
load requirements. Aligned
with this concept are ad-
vances toward accreditation of clinical services, from trauma
and cancer care centers to medical education programs.
Accreditation is a method of ensuring quality through
setting and following standards as well as robust and trans-
parentmeasurementprocesses.2Theintendedbenefitsarecon-
fidence and choice for patients; service improvement, lever-
age, and recognition for health care professionals; quality
assurance for hospital boards; standard setting and influence
for professional organizations; identification of high-value
service providers for health insurers; and management and co-
ordination of health services for policy makers.
The Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and
Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP), a conglomeration
of 2 previous initiatives, emerged in 2014 to advance safe and
high-quality care for all patients. The MBSAQIP’
s success has
been impressive, with more than 88% of bariatric surgical pro-
cedures in the United States performed at accredited centers.3
Nonetheless, variation continues to exist and is undoubtedly
an opportunity for ongoing quality improvement.
In this issue of JAMA Surgery, Ibrahim and colleagues4
studiedthecomplicationratesamong145 526patientswhoun-
derwentbariatricproceduresbetweenJanuary1,2010,andDe-
cember 31, 2013, at 165 bariatric centers of excellence from 12
US states. Some 6970 (4.8%) patients experienced a compli-
cation, of which 2367 (1.6%) were deemed serious. The au-
thors reported a 17-fold variation in complication rates across
centers, a 9.5-fold variation in complication rates between
states, and an almost 18-fold variation in case volume thresh-
old levels.
The key finding of the study is that quality improvement is
not a 1-time effort but an ongoing and continuous process.
Where does the MBSAQIP go from here? Ibrahim and col-
leagues suggest a forward plan from surgical skill improve-
ment and clinical pathway adherence, perhaps through
regional collaboratives, to quality stratification based on clini-
cal outcome measures. Previous research among Medicare pa-
tients undergoing bariatric surgery reported no significant dif-
ferences in complication and reoperation rates between
accredited and nonaccredited bariatric surgery centers.5 Im-
provements in outcome were apparent prior to selective refer-
ral to accredited centers, which suggest that factors other than
accreditation alone were at work.
The past decade has witnessed improved operative tech-
nologies, better training and education programs, evidence-
based clinical pathways, more informed patients because of
support groups and social media, and improved rescue of pa-
tients with a complication. Accreditation requirements have
set standards from which all stakeholders can benefit, per-
haps through a herd effect for all centers rather than a binary
phenomenon of accreditation alone. Ongoing outcomes im-
provement necessitates collaborative approaches that are evi-
dence based, innovative, and inclusive as well as aligned with
measures such as weight loss, resolution of comorbidities, and
patient-reported quality of life. Such approaches define best
care and ensure its provision to all patients.
