 Associations Between Marijuana Use and Cardiovascular Risk Factors
and Outcomes
A Systematic Review
Divya Ravi, MD, MPH; Mehrnaz Ghasemiesfe, MD; Deborah Korenstein, MD; Thomas Cascino, MD; and
Salomeh Keyhani, MD, MPH
Background: Marijuana use is increasing in the United States,
and its effect on cardiovascular health is unknown.
Purpose: To review harms and benefits of marijuana use in re-
lation to cardiovascular risk factors and clinical outcomes.
Data Sources: PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and the
Cochrane Library between 1 January 1975 and 30 September
2017.
Study Selection: Observational studies that were published in
English, enrolled adults using any form of marijuana, and
reported on vascular risk factors (hyperglycemia, diabetes, dys-
lipidemia, and obesity) or on outcomes (stroke, myocardial in-
farction, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality in car-
diovascular cohorts).
Data Extraction: Study characteristics and quality were as-
sessed by 4 reviewers independently; strength of evidence for
each outcome was graded by consensus.
Data Synthesis: 13 and 11 studies examined associations be-
tween marijuana use and cardiovascular risk factors and clinical
outcomes, respectively. Although 6 studies suggested a meta-
bolic benefit from marijuana use, they were based on cross-
sectional designs and were not supported by prospective stud-
ies. Evidence examining the effect of marijuana on diabetes,
dyslipidemia, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascu-
lar and all-cause mortality was insufficient. Although the current
literature includes several long-term prospective studies, they
are limited by recall bias, inadequate exposure assessment,
minimal marijuana exposure, and a predominance of low-risk
cohorts.
Limitation: Poor- or moderate-quality data, inadequate assess-
ment of marijuana exposure and minimal exposure in the popu-
lations studied, and variation in study design.
Conclusion: Evidence examining the effect of marijuana on car-
diovascular risk factors and outcomes, including stroke and myo-
cardial infarction, is insufficient.

A
s more states legalize the sale and consumption of
marijuana, the number of Americans using it con-
tinues to rise (1, 2). This increase in the use of marijuana
highlights the need for a better understanding of its
risks and benefits. One area of importance is its effect
on cardiovascular disease, the number one cause of
morbidity and mortality worldwide (3).
Marijuana
may
affect
cardiovascular
health
in
several ways. Like other psychoactive drugs, it may
have hemodynamic effects that can precipitate events
(4).
The
active
ingredient
in
marijuana
is
Δ9-
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (5), which is responsible
for the psychoactive effects of marijuana through its in-
teraction with cannabinoid receptors. These receptors
are ubiquitous in the brain and its vasculature and pres-
ent throughout the body, including the myocardium,
coronary endothelium, and smooth muscle cells (6, 7).
In vitro and animal studies have reported that THC can
modulate cannabinoid receptors on human cardiomy-
ocytes and vascular smooth muscles, resulting in isch-
emia (7, 8). In vitro studies also have demonstrated that
THC influences the regulation of glucose and lipid me-
tabolism, suggesting a possible effect on vascular risk
factors (9, 10). At the cellular level, THC may cause in-
flammatory cytokine release, alteration in lipid metabo-
lism (11, 12), and reactive oxygen species formation
(13). These effects may potentiate the progression of
vascular disease. Marijuana smoking, the predominant
method of use, causes a 5-fold increase in the blood
carboxyhemoglobin level and a 3-fold increment in the
quantity of tar inhaled compared with tobacco (14).
Studies on secondhand marijuana smoke have found
endothelial dysfunction in rats after exposure (15).
Given the myriad ways in which marijuana might
potentiate vascular disease, we conducted a systematic
review to assess the effect of regular marijuana use on
cardiovascular outcomes and their associated risk
factors.
METHODS
The
protocol
was
registered
at
PROSPERO
(CRD42016051297) (16) at the start of our investiga-
tion. This review focuses on studies examining mari-
juana use and cardiovascular risk factors and out-
comes; our protocol also includes searches and a
review of hemodynamic changes associated with mari-
juana use that are not reported here.

 Data Sources and Searches
We searched several online databases (PubMed,
MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Li-
brary) for titles and abstracts between 1 January 1975
and 30 September 2017. We chose a 1975 start date
because that was the year the Alaska Supreme Court
ruled that the “Alaska constitution'
s right to privacy pro-
tects an adult'
s ability to use and possess a small
amount of marijuana in the home for personal use”
(17). We also conducted reference and author tracking
to identify additional articles and searched Clinical-
Trials.gov and the National Institutes of Health Re-
search Portfolio (NIH RePORTER) for ongoing or com-
pleted studies not reported in the literature. For search
terms and details, see Supplement 1 (available at
Annals.org).
Study Selection
All
titles
and
abstracts
were
independently
screened by 2 reviewers (M.G. and D.R.). We included
observational
studies
(cohort,
case–control,
cross-
sectional) and interventional studies (randomized con-
trolled trials, experimental studies) that enrolled partic-
ipants older than 12 years and were published in
English. The exposure criterion was any form of mari-
juana (plant or pharmaceutical). The main outcomes of
interest were cardiovascular risk factors and outcomes.
We excluded case reports, case series, review articles,
editorials, and in vitro and animal studies. The same 2
investigators independently reviewed the full texts of
selected articles to identify those that met our inclusion
criteria. Disagreements regarding inclusion were re-
solved by a third reviewer (S.K.). Interrater reliability for
the abstract selection process and the concurrent deci-
sion to include the article in the review was excellent
(Cohen �, 0.87). For the selection process, see Supple-
ment 2 (available at Annals.org).
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
For each included study, the reviewers collected
information on study design (observational or experi-
mental), the study population (for example, healthy vol-
unteers, regular users, or hospitalized patients), age
distribution, cannabis make-up (plant based or phar-
maceutical), route of exposure (smoking, vaporizing,
eating, or injecting), exposure duration, and funding
source.
Four investigators (D.R., M.G., S.K., and D.K.) inde-
pendently rated study quality as low, moderate, or high
risk of bias (ROB). We assessed ROB for outcomes in
trials with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (18), and for
outcomes in observational studies with the Newcastle-
Ottawa scale (19). Disagreements were resolved by
consensus. Risk-of-bias tools and scoring are available
in Supplement 3 (available at Annals.org).
Data Synthesis and Analysis
We performed a qualitative assessment and syn-
thesis of evidence. Because of the heterogeneity of out-
comes and lack of reporting of effect sizes, we did not
pool any data. Through group discussion, we graded
the overall strength of the evidence for each outcome
as insufficient, low, moderate, or high on the basis of
methods outlined by the Agency for Healthcare Re-
search and Quality (20).
Role of the Funding Source
The NIH had no role in the design, analysis, inter-
pretation of data, preparation or approval of the
manuscript, or decision to submit the manuscript for
publication.
RESULTS
Literature Search
Our search yielded 3006 abstracts, 1669 of which
were selected for further evaluation. Among these, 140
were selected for full-text review. Another 7 articles were
added via author and reference tracking. Of these 147
papers, 24 met our inclusion criteria (Figure).
Study Characteristics
The evidence included 9 prospective cohort stud-
ies, 3 retrospective cohort studies, 2 case–control stud-
ies, 2 interventional studies (1 experimental study and 1
randomized trial), 7 cross-sectional studies, and 1 case-
crossover study. Thirteen studies assessed cardiovascu-
lar risk factors, and 11 examined cardiovascular dis-
eases. Most studies (n = 16; 66.7%) did not report the
chemical constitution (for example, THC vs. cannabi-
diol) of the marijuana used in the study. Among articles
that specified the form of marijuana used, the plant-
based form was predominant (n = 7). Among those that
specified the route of exposure, smoking was predom-
inant (n = 11), followed by oral use (n = 2). Eleven pa-
pers did not report the specific route or form of mari-
juana administration (such as edible or smoked). Tables
1 to 4 of Supplement 3 (available at Annals.org) detail
the quality assessments for individual studies.
Cardiovascular Risk Factors
Metabolic Parameters: Lipid and Glucose Levels
and Diabetes
Eleven studies provided data on 1 or more meta-
bolic parameter outcomes, including hyperglycemia,
dyslipidemia, and diabetes (Appendix Table 1, avail-
able at Annals.org).
Five cross-sectional studies (3 low and 2 high ROB)
examined the association between marijuana use and
hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, or
diabetes (21–25). Marijuana use was measured by self-
report in all studies. Four studies were based on 3 dif-
ferent waves of the NHANES (National Health and Nu-
trition Examination Survey; 1988 to 1994, 2005 to 2010,
and 2005 to 2012) (21–23, 25). Three of the 4 used
multivariable analysis to examine the association be-
tween marijuana use and metabolic parameters after
adjustment for baseline characteristics. All 3 studies re-
ported that marijuana use had different favorable asso-
ciations, including a lower prevalence of diabetes (22),
lower glucose levels (25), or higher high-density lipo-
protein cholesterol concentrations (21, 22, 25). The
fourth NHANES study (2005 to 2012) used both regres-
sion models and an instrumental variable analysis to

 examine associations (23). Marijuana use was associ-
ated with a beneficial metabolic effect in the regression
model evaluation; no such effect was seen in the instru-
mental variable analysis. The final cross-sectional study
was an exploratory analysis based on a small sample of
30 persons who were heavy marijuana users and 30
control participants matched for age, sex, ethnicity, and
body mass index (BMI) (24). The authors identified no
differences between groups in glucose tolerance or
fasting glucose, total cholesterol, or triglyceride levels.
Three prospective studies (1 low, 1 moderate, and
1 high ROB) examined the association of marijuana use
with risk factors (26–28). Two were based on the
CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young
Adults) cohort study, which examined the development
and determinants of clinical and subclinical cardiovas-
cular disease and its risk factors (26, 28). The CARDIA
study began in 1985 to 1986 with 5113 black and white
men and women aged 18 to 30 years. It included com-
prehensive in-person baseline and outcome data (so-
ciodemographic characteristics; fasting glucose levels;
BMI; diet and physical activity; and use of tobacco, al-
cohol, and other substances) and several exposure as-
sessments during a long follow-up. Questions pertain-
ing to marijuana use lacked detail on the form used,
and exposure was quantified differently in each study.
The low-ROB CARDIA-based study reported no associ-
ations between marijuana use and changes in glucose,
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or triglyceride lev-
els among heavy users (>1800 days of use) compared
with nonusers during 15 years of follow-up (26). The
moderate-ROB CARDIA-based study examined the as-
sociation between marijuana use and diabetes and pre-
diabetes (28). Marijuana use was ascertained in year 7
of the prospective cohort, and exposure was very lim-
ited: The highest category of use was a lifetime fre-
quency of more than 100 times. Incidence of diabetes
and prediabetes assessed at 4 subsequent follow-up
examinations over 18 years was based on laboratory
assessment (oral glucose tolerance or glycosylated he-
moglobin test). A greater risk for prediabetes (hazard
ratio [HR], 1.39 [95% CI, 1.13 to 1.71]) was identified
among participants who reported using marijuana 100
or more times during follow-up compared with nonus-
ers. The final prospective study (high ROB) followed
18 000 Swedish men and women aged 18 to 84 years
over 10 years but assessed marijuana exposure only
once, at baseline (27). Measures of socioeconomic fac-
tors, diet, or other drug use at baseline were limited.
No definite relationship was found between marijuana
use and diabetes; CIs around the risk estimate were
wide and compatible with either increased or de-
creased risk for diabetes with marijuana use (adjusted
odds ratio, 0.94 [CI, 0.63 to 1.42]).

 Two experimental studies (high ROB) examined the
effect of cannabis-related compounds on metabolic
factors (29, 30). Both had small sample sizes, and nei-
ther
identified
a
measurable
effect
on
metabolic
parameters.
Obesity
The association between marijuana use and obe-
sity was evaluated in 1 prospective study; 1 retrospec-
tive study; 1 randomized controlled trial; and 4 cross-
sectional studies, 2 of which were based on NHANES
(both low ROB) (21, 23). None of these studies found an
association between marijuana use and BMI. Another
cross-sectional study of 786 Inuit adults (moderate
ROB) found that participants who used marijuana in the
past year had a lower BMI than nonusers (odds ratio,
0.56 [CI, 0.37 to 0.84]). Although this study included
important baseline characteristics, such as physical ac-
tivity and dietary intake, the marijuana exposure assess-
ment that divided the population into ever- and never-
users was inadequate (31). Another study (high ROB)
examined the charts of 297 women referred for weight
management and found that marijuana use was associ-
ated with a lower BMI (R2, 0.96; P = 0.0173). This trial
was limited by lack of adjustment for baseline charac-
teristics and biased sample selection (32).
One prospective cohort study (low ROB) found no
association between marijuana use and changes in BMI
(mean [±SE] adjusted BMI among nonusers, 28.9 ± 0.3
kg/m2;
mean
[±SE]
BMI
among
frequent
users,
28.9 ± 0.3 kg/m2) (26). In a longitudinal pre birth study
(the Mater-University of Queensland Study of Preg-
nancy) in 7223 women and their offspring (high ROB),
the children were administered health, sociodemo-
graphic, and lifestyle questionnaires at ages 14 and 21
years (33). Although BMI was measured at both ages, a
retrospective assessment of marijuana use was con-
ducted only at age 21. Daily cannabis users were less
likely (odds ratio, 0.2 [CI, 0.1 to 0.4]) to have a BMI
greater than 25 kg/m2 than were never-users. This
study was limited by inadequate baseline data on the
children.
In a small double-blind placebo-controlled ran-
domized trial (high ROB), the effect of 5 mg of dronabi-
nol on BMI was assessed at 28 days in 13 of the 19
participants who completed follow-up (30). No statisti-
cally significant association was found between mari-
juana use and BMI.
Clinical Outcomes
Details of described studies are available in Appen-
dix Table 2 (available at Annals.org).
Acute Myocardial Infarction
The MIOS (Determinants of Myocardial Infarction
Onset Study) was a case-crossover study that examined
marijuana use as a potential trigger for myocardial in-
farction (34). In this multicenter trial, 3882 patients with
acute myocardial infarction were interviewed, on aver-
age within 4 days of their infarction, about their history,
timing, and frequency of marijuana smoking. Marijuana
use in the 1 hour immediately preceding the onset of
myocardial infarction symptoms was then compared
with its expected frequency on the basis of self-
reported use during the previous year. Of the 3882 pa-
tients, 9 (0.2%) and 124 (3.2%) reported smoking mar-
ijuana within 1 hour of the onset of myocardial
infarction symptoms and in the previous year, respec-
tively. The myocardial infarction risk in the first hour
after smoking was greater than that expected among
users (relative risk, 4.8 [CI, 2.4 to 9.5]). That individuals
served as their own control helped limit confounding
from other behaviors that may be associated with mar-
ijuana use. The study, however, was assessed as mod-
erate ROB, primarily because of recall bias.
Stroke
Two prospective studies examined the effect of
marijuana exposure on stroke and transient ischemic
attack (35, 36). One study (moderate ROB), based on
CARDIA, reported that marijuana was not associated
with stroke (adjusted HR, 0.65 [CI, 0.16 to 2.66]; P =
0.76); however, the exposure was minimal (median life-
time of 0.51 marijuana-years or 50 times) and the pop-
ulation was young and healthy (35). Another study
(high ROB) enrolled 49 321 Swedish men conscripted
into compulsory military service between the ages of
18 and 20 years. They were followed until age 59 to
assess the initial occurrence of stroke. No association
between cannabis use and stroke (HR, 0.93 [CI, 0.34 to
2.57]) was identified, but the study was limited by po-
tential misclassification of the exposure, given that it
was not reassessed over 25 years of follow-up and ad-
justment for baseline characteristics was inadequate
(36).
A third study (high ROB) using a case–control de-
sign compared patients (aged 18 to 55 years) admitted
to the hospital for stroke or transient ischemic attack
with other, matched hospitalized patients. It found no
association between stroke and plant-based marijuana
use (adjusted odds ratio, 1.59 [CI, 0.71 to 3.70]); how-
ever, the study was limited because it measured use
with urine toxicology screens, and although all case
participants were screened, it is unclear why the control
participants underwent screening. The urine drug
screen may have misclassified exposure, because re-
sults may remain positive for up to 10 weeks (37).
Cardiovascular Mortality and All-Cause Mortality
Two prospective cohort studies (both high ROB)
involving myocardial infarction survivors enrolled in
MIOS between 1989 and 1996 examined the associa-
tion between marijuana use and mortality (38, 39). Mar-
ijuana use in the year before the first myocardial infarc-
tion
was
self-reported
at
baseline
and
was
not
evaluated again. Cause of death was assessed by phy-
sician review of death certificates. In the study that fol-
lowed patients for a median of 3.8 years, baseline use
of marijuana once weekly or more (HR, 4.2 [CI, 1.2 to
14.3]) and less than once weekly (HR, 2.5 [CI, 0.9 to

 7.3]) was associated with an increased risk for cardio-
vascular mortality compared with nonuse. This study
also found an association between marijuana use and
an increased risk for all-cause mortality (HR, 3.0 [CI, 1.3
to 7.0]; P = 0.009) (38). In the other MIOS-based study,
which followed patients for a median of 12.7 years, any
marijuana use was associated with an increased risk for
all-cause mortality compared with nonuse, although the
finding was not statistically significant (HR, 1.29 [CI,
0.81 to 2.05]; P = 0.28) (39).
Another
investigation
(moderate
ROB)
used
CARDIA data to examine the association between cu-
mulative lifetime marijuana use and cardiovascular
mortality (35). This study measured exposure several
times and had robust assessment of baseline character-
istics and outcomes. It found no association between
marijuana use (cumulative ≥5 years and recent) and
cardiovascular mortality (adjusted HR, 0.95 [CI, 0.2 to
4.59]). The study also included a composite outcome of
cardiovascular mortality, stroke, and coronary heart dis-
ease and, again, found no association between 5 or
more years of marijuana use and this combined out-
come (adjusted HR, 0.72 [CI, 0.35 to 1.50]). However,
median cumulative marijuana exposure in the cohort
was minimal (0.51 marijuana-years over 26 years). Fur-
ther, although participants were followed for 26 years,
the median age at recruitment was 18 to 30 years. Be-
cause of these factors, the study probably was under-
powered to assess the association between marijuana
use and cardiovascular disease. Finally, a retrospective
cohort study (high ROB) linking NHANES to the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics survey found that us-
ers were at higher risk than nonusers for “hypertension-
related” mortality. However, the marijuana exposure
assessment was flawed, the outcome definition unclear,
and the adjustment for baseline differences inadequate
(40).
Other Cardiovascular Outcomes
Four studies examined the association between
marijuana use and various outcomes, including periph-
eral arterial disease (41), irregular heartbeat (42), mul-
tifocal intracranial stenosis (43), and aneurysmal sub-
arachnoid hemorrhage (44). All 4 studies were rated as
high ROB, primarily because their marijuana exposure
assessments and adjustments for baseline risk factors
were inadequate.
Ongoing Studies
We found no relevant ongoing or completed stud-
ies at ClinicalTrials.gov (Supplement 1). Our search of
NIH RePORTER revealed a prospective cohort study
funded by the NIH in 2017 called Impact of Marijuana
on Adherence, Risk Factor Control and Cardiovascular
Outcomes (45). This project is evaluating the associa-
tion between smoking marijuana in the past 30 days
and the composite outcome of acute myocardial infarc-
tion, stroke, and revascularization in elderly patients
with coronary artery disease.
DISCUSSION
Evidence that marijuana use either increases or de-
creases most cardiovascular risk factors is insufficient,
as is evidence regarding any association between mar-
ijuana use and adverse cardiovascular outcomes (Ta-
ble). The current available literature is limited by a pre-
ponderance of cross-sectional study designs. Although
the literature includes several long-term prospective
studies, they are limited by recall bias, a lack of robust
longitudinal assessment of marijuana use, participants
with infrequent marijuana use, and the relative youth of
some of the cohorts.
A MEDLINE search revealed a recent systematic re-
view (46) of marijuana harms that identified 2 studies
(rated as high ROB in the review) on the relationship
between marijuana use and cardiovascular events (34,
39). We included both articles in our systematic review
and assessed 1 of them differently, assigning its ROB as
moderate rather than high (34). The strength of this
study lies in the minimization of confounding. Marijuana
users also engage in other behaviors that are associated
with poor outcomes. The use of a case-crossover design
in the study of marijuana compares each participant to
him- or herself and eliminates this problem. The study was
limited by recall bias related to the marijuana use assess-
ment; otherwise, it was well-designed.
Although some cross-sectional studies in this re-
view suggested that marijuana has metabolic benefits
(21, 22, 25, 31–33), those with more robust analytic de-
signs found no evidence of benefit (23), and other pro-
spective studies found potentially harmful effects (28).
These findings are of particular interest. Many articles in
the lay press have suggested to the public that mari-
juana use has cardiovascular benefits, reduces blood
pressure, stabilizes blood sugar levels, or improves
cholesterol profiles (47, 48). Our review found insuffi-
cient evidence to support these claims. Given public
opinion that marijuana is safe or even beneficial, the
insufficiency of the literature is concerning (49). An ac-
tive research agenda in this area is needed to provide
the public with accurate information. Finally, despite
the popular belief that marijuana use causes “the
munchies” (50), we found no evidence that it is associ-
ated with weight gain or obesity.
An important consideration in our understanding
of marijuana effects relates to the standards of evi-
dence necessary to identify harms. Using experimental
trials to study marijuana harms is unethical; only obser-
vational studies are feasible, despite their inherent bi-
ases. Further, the greatest clinical uncertainty concerns
older patients at higher risk for cardiovascular disease
(such as those with hypertension and diabetes) who
use marijuana regularly over long periods. Therefore,
the best possible study to assess the effect of marijuana
use on cardiovascular outcomes would be a prospec-
tive cohort study among higher-risk participants, with
several exposure assessments during follow-up and a
robust evaluation of baseline characteristics and out-
comes. The best evidence currently available, in con-
trast, is from the MIOS and CARDIA cohorts, although

 both have serious flaws (26, 28, 34, 35). Whereas MIOS
assessed marijuana exposure only once and was lim-
ited by recall bias, CARDIA made several assessments
of marijuana exposure, but the overall exposure in the
cohort was minimal and the cohort was young and
likely underpowered to assess the outcomes of stroke
and cardiovascular mortality.
Our systematic review also highlights other impor-
tant evidence gaps. First, most studies failed to capture
current and lifetime marijuana use adequately. More
robust exposure assessment tools are necessary to al-
low evaluation of the acute and long-term health effects
of marijuana (51). Second, almost a quarter of the stud-
ies failed to report the specific route of cannabis use
and the chemical constitution of the cannabis exam-
ined. The number of marijuana users, as well as the
variety of routes (for example, vaping, dabbing, ingest-
ing, topical application), is increasing; therefore, collec-
tion of data regarding use must be more standardized,
because the various forms may differ in toxic effects. In
particular, high-quality safety data on the effects of ed-
ible marijuana on the cardiovascular system are lack-
ing. The effects of THC persist in the body longer after
oral administration than inhalation. Prospective studies

diovascular events, such as acute myocardial infarction

Poorly designed RCTs and cross-sectional studies (with
variable rigor in analysis) reported mixed findings.
HDL-C level
1 prospective cohort study,1 RCT,
and 6 cross-sectional studies
Insufficient
1 well-designed prospective study with low bias found no
effect on HDL-C levels.
1 RCT limited by small, unjustified sample size and the
cross-sectional studies (with variable rigor in analysis)
reported mixed findings.
Obesity (BMI)
1 prospective cohort study,
1 retrospective cohort study,
1 trial, and 4 cross-sectional
studies
Low
1 well-designed prospective study and 2 low-ROB
cross-sectional studies found no link to obesity.
All available data suggested that marijuana use had no
association with BMI or that marijuana use was associated
with lower BMI.
The studies that suggested marijuana use was associated with
lower BMI were limited by cross-sectional study designs.
Myocardial infarction
1 case-crossover study
Insufficient
Potential confounding from recall bias but an otherwise
well-designed study.
Stroke
2 prospective cohort studies and
1 case–control study
Insufficient
Minimal exposure to marijuana and single-exposure
assessments over long follow-ups; some cohorts were
young and healthy (underpowered).
Cardiovascular mortality
2 prospective cohort studies and
1 retrospective study
Insufficient
1 prospective study was limited by recall bias and inadequate
exposure assessment, and the second was flawed because
it was probably underpowered to assess events; the
retrospective study had several methodological flaws,
including an inadequate exposure assessment.
All-cause mortality
1 prospective cohort study
Insufficient
Flawed exposure assessment (subject to recall bias).
Cardiovascular disease
1 prospective cohort study
Insufficient
Minimal exposure to marijuana, and cohorts were young and
healthy (underpowered).
Peripheral vascular
disease
1 case–control study
Insufficient
Inadequate adjustment for confounders and several other
methodological flaws.
Arrhythmia
1 cross-sectional study
Insufficient
Inadequate adjustment for confounders and several other
methodological flaws.
Multifocal intracranial
stenosis
1 cross-sectional study
Insufficient
Inadequate adjustment for confounders and several other
methodological flaws.
Intracranial hemorrhage
1 cross-sectional study
Insufficient
Inadequate adjustment for confounders and several other
methodological flaws.

REVIEW
Marijuana Use and Cardiovascular Risk Factors and Outcomes

 and stroke, are necessary, especially because use of
edible forms is increasing among older adults, who are
at higher risk for cardiovascular disease (52).
Our study has several limitations that deserve com-
ment. We excluded articles not published in English;
thus, we may have overlooked relevant studies. The di-
verse representation of outcomes across studies, variation
in study design, and frequent lack of effect size reporting
precluded a meta-analysis. In addition, most studies inad-
equately assessed marijuana exposure. Finally, most stud-
ies in this review were rated as high ROB, so their results
should be interpreted with caution.
In summary, although several studies suggested a
metabolic benefit from marijuana use, they were based
on cross-sectional designs and not supported by pro-
spective studies. Evidence examining the effect of mar-
ijuana on diabetes, hyperlipidemia, acute myocardial
infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular mortality was in-
sufficient. Adequately powered prospective studies are
needed to determine the effect of chronic marijuana
use on cardiovascular health.
