IMPORTANCE Previous reports have linked maternal prepregnancy obesity with low folate
concentrations and child overweight or obesity (OWO) in separate studies. To our knowledge,
the role of maternal folate concentrations, alone or in combination with maternal OWO, in
child metabolic health has not been examined in a prospective birth cohort.
OBJECTIVE To test the hypotheses that maternal folate concentrations can significantly affect
child metabolic health and that sufficient maternal folate concentrations can mitigate
prepregnancy obesity-induced child metabolic risk.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective birth cohort study was conducted at
the Boston Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts. It included 1517 mother-child dyads
recruited at birth from 1998 to 2012 and followed up prospectively up to 9 years from 2003
to 2014.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Child body mass index z score calculated according to US
reference data, OWO defined as a body mass index in the 85th percentile or greater for age
and sex, and metabolic biomarkers (leptin, insulin, and adiponectin).
RESULTS The mean (SD) age was 28.6 (6.5) years for mothers and 6.2 (2.4) years for the
children. An L-shaped association between maternal folate concentrations and child OWO
was observed: the risk for OWO was higher among those in the lowest quartile (Q1) as
compared with those in Q2 through Q4, with an odds ratio of 1.45 (95% CI, 1.13-1.87). The
highest risk for child OWO was found among children of obese mothers with low folate
concentrations (odds ratio, 3.05; 95% CI, 1.91-4.86) compared with children of
normal-weight mothers with folate concentrations in Q2 through Q4 after accounting for
multiple covariables. Among children of obese mothers, their risk for OWO was associated
with a 43% reduction (odds ratio, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.34-0.95) if their mothers had folate
concentrations in Q2 through Q4 compared with Q1. Similar patterns were observed for child
metabolic biomarkers.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this urban low-income prospective birth cohort, we
demonstrated an L-shaped association between maternal plasma folate concentrations and
child OWO and the benefit of sufficient folate concentrations, especially among obese
mothers. The threshold concentration identified in this study exceeded the clinical definition
of folate deficiency, which was primarily based on the hematological effect of folate. Our
findings underscore the need to establish optimal rather than minimal folate concentrations
for preventing adverse metabolic outcomes in the offspring.

demicincurrentandfuturegenerations.5,6However,questions
remainregardingwhatearly-lifefactorscanenhanceormitigate
theadverseeffectsofmaternalobesityonchildobesityandwhat
underlying molecular mechanisms are involved.
Growingevidencesuggeststhatmaternalnutrition,through
its effect on the fetal intrauterine environment, has a pro-
found and life-long influence on child health.7 Among several
specific nutrients that have been implicated, folate—an essen-
tial B vitamin involved in nucleic acid synthesis, DNA methyla-
tion, cellular growth8—is particularly important. The demand
for folate increases during pregnancy due to fetal and placen-
tal growth and uterus enlargement.9 Research has shown the
benefits of sufficient folate on reproductive, neurodevelop-
mental, and cardiovascular health10-13 and, in particular, on
preventing fetal neural tube defects12,13 and counteracting ad-
verse reproductive effects of environmental endocrine
disruptors.10 However, in the United States, despite universal
folic acid fortification of cereal grain products and the recom-
mendation for women of reproductive age and especially preg-
nant women to take multivitamins,14 almost one-quarter of
these women have insufficient folate to prevent neural tube
defects.15 Maternal obesity has been linked with low blood
folate concentrations16,17 and, as such, obese mothers are at a
higher risk for folate insufficiency compared with normal-
weight mothers. From this perspective, studying the indi-
vidualandcombinedeffectsofmaternalobesityandfolatecon-
centrations offers another possibility to counteract maternal
obesity–induced metabolic risk via the optimization of mater-
nal folate status, a relatively safe and inexpensive strategy.
Folate can improve insulin sensitivity18 and act as a super-
oxide scavenger.19 In animal models, methyl supplements dur-
ing pregnancy can prevent transgenerational amplification of
obesity.20 However, relevant data are lacking in humans. Two
publishedobservationalstudiesbasedonretrospectiverecallof
prenatalmultivitaminintakedidnotfindanassociationbetween
prenatal vitamin intake and offspring adiposity21,22; however,
these studies did not measure maternal folate concentrations.
Using data on plasma folate concentrations from a well-
established US prospective birth cohort, we sought to test the
hypothesesthatmaternalplasmafolateconcentrationscansig-
nificantly affect child metabolic health and that sufficient ma-
ternalfolateconcentrationscanalleviateprepregnancyobesity-
induced child metabolic risk as measured by child body mass
index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in
meters squared), OWO, and metabolic biomarkers (insulin,
leptin, and adiponectin).
Methods
Study Participants
This study included mother-infant pairs from the Boston Birth
Cohort (BBC), which was initiated in 1998 with a rolling en-
rollment in Boston, Massachusetts, a predominantly urban,
low-income minority population, as described previously.23
At enrollment, each mother completed a questionnaire
interview that assessed prepregnancy weight, height, race/
ethnicity, education, smoking, parity, perceived stress dur-
ing pregnancy, prenatal multivitamin intake, and a blood draw
within 48 to 72 hours after delivery. Since 2003, all children
who were enrolled in the BBC and planned to receive primary
care at the Boston Medical Center were eligible for postnatal
follow-up. A standardized questionnaire was used to assess
postnatal demographic and environmental information.24
As illustrated in the flowchart (eFigure 1 in the Supple-
ment), of the 2891 mother-children pairs who were enrolled
from 1998 to 2012 and followed up prospectively up to 9 years,
this study included 1517 mother-children pairs who com-
pleted at least 1 postnatal well-child care visit beyond age 2
years at the Boston Medical Center and had complete data on
maternal BMI and plasma folate concentrations. Maternal
demographic characteristics and birth outcomes were com-
parable between the samples included in and excluded from
this study (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
The study protocol was approved by the institutional re-
view boards of Boston University Medical Center, Ann and
Robert H. Lurie Children’
s Hospital of Chicago, and Johns
Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Written in-
formed consent was obtained from all of the study mothers.
Perinatal Variables
Maternalprepregnancyweightandheightwereprimarilybased
on a standard maternal questionnaire interview within 2 to 3
daysofdelivery.Atthattime,thestudymotherswerenotaware
of their folate status and did not know their child’
s future
growth trajectory. Maternal BMI was categorized into 3 groups:
normal weight (18.5-24.9), overweight (25-29.9), and obesity
(≥30). Underweight mothers were removed from the analysis
owing to small sample size.
Educational attainment was classified into high school
and below vs college and above; maternal smoking during
pregnancy was classified into 3 groups: never smoker, inter-
mittent, or continuous smoker25; and maternal race/
ethnicity were classified as black, Hispanic, or other (which
Key Points
Question Does maternal folate concentration, singularly and with
maternal overweight or obesity, affect child metabolic health and
child overweight or obesity status?
Findings In this cohort study, among 1517 mother-child dyads
followed up from birth through age 9 years in the Boston Birth
Cohort, low maternal folate concentrations were associated with
increased child metabolic risk as measured by body mass index
z score, overweight or obesity, and metabolic biomarkers.
Adequate maternal folate concentrations mitigated the
detrimental effects of maternal obesity on the offspring.
Meaning Our findings underscore the importance of an optimal
maternal folate concentration for preventing offspring metabolic
risk, especially among obese mothers.

included white, Asian, Pacific Islander, and more than 1 race/
ethnicity). Perceived stress during pregnancy was grouped
into low vs high.26 Maternal diabetes status was classified as
nondiabetic or diabetic (either preexisting or gestational
diabetes).23 Infant breastfeeding history was collected in
follow-up visits and 70.5% of the questionnaire interview
was completed before the child reached 2 years of age.
Breastfeeding was grouped into exclusively breast, exclu-
sively formula, or mixed breast and formula.24
Gestational age was determined by the first day of the
last menstrual period and early prenatal ultrasonographic
results25 and categorized into term (≥37 weeks), which was
further grouped into late term (≥39 weeks) and early term
(37-38 weeks), and preterm (<37 weeks), which was further
grouped into late preterm (34-36 weeks) and early preterm
(<34 weeks).23 Information regarding cesarean delivery and
birth weight was abstracted from the electronic medical
record.
Definitions of Overweight or Obesity in Childhood
Child weight and height were measured by medical staff dur-
ingwell-childcarevisitsasdocumentedintheelectronicmedi-
cal record. Body mass index z scores and percentiles were cal-
culated using US national reference data.27 Overweight or
obesity was defined as a BMI in the 85th percentile or greater
for age and sex.

Ascertainment of Plasma Folate and Vitamin B12
Concentrations and Metabolic Biomarkers
Plasma folate and vitamin B12 concentrations were measured
by a commercial laboratory via chemiluminescent immuno-
assay using a MAGLUMI 2000 Analyzer (Snibe Co Ltd) with
interassay coefficient of variation of less than 4%.11
We assessed child plasma insulin (a marker of insulin
resistance),23 leptin (a marker of adiposity),28 and adiponec-
tin to leptin ratio (a marker of insulin sensitivity)29 using es-
tablished methods. Plasma insulin and leptin concentrations
were determined using sandwich immunoassays based on
flow metric xMAP technology on Luminex 200 machines
(Luminex Corp).23 Adiponectin was measured by enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay with an interassay coefficient of
variation of less than 5.8%.
Statistical Analysis
The primary outcomes of interest included BMI z score (con-
tinuous variable) and OWO (binary) at the last well-child care
visit, as well as metabolic biomarkers in early childhood. The
primarypredictorswereplasmafolateconcentrationsthatwere
evaluated both as continuous variables and as categorical vari-
ables in quartiles (Qs). At first, we examined the association
ofmaternalplasmafolateconcentrationswithchildBMIzscore
and OWO probability using smoothing plots (PROC LOESS).
Given that there was no significant difference in the risk for
OWO between Q2 and Q4, we grouped maternal folate con-
centrations into low (Q1) vs adequate (Q2-Q4) in the subse-
quent analyses as there is no standard, clinically meaningful
cutpoint for low folate concentrations relevant to metabolic
outcomes. Available clinical cutoffs are mainly for anemia and
vary by definition.30 Furthermore, we estimated the com-
bined effects of maternal folate concentrations and prepreg-
nancy BMI categories on child BMI and metabolic biomarkers
zscoresusinglinearregressionmodels.Asplasmainsulinlevel,
leptin level, and adiponectin to leptin ratio all had skewed dis-
tributions, these biomarkers were log transformed before cal-
culating age- and sex-specific z scores. As a next step, we es-
timated the individual and combined effects of maternal folate
concentrationsandprepregnancyBMIcategoriesonchildOWO
using logistic regression models. We tested the interaction of
maternal prepregnancy BMI categories (as a categorical vari-
able with 3 levels) and folate status (as a binary variable) on
child BMI and metabolic biomarker z scores and odds of OWO
by including cross-product terms in models with indicator
terms for BMI categories and folate status. The effect modifi-
cations were tested with the likelihood ratio test using an a
priori α value of .05. To further assess the robustness of the
findings, we conducted stratified analyses by child age group
(2-5 years vs 6-9 years), race (black only, the major race group
in the BBC), and preterm vs term birth.
Covariables were selected based on the published litera-
ture and our previous studies in the BBC. In addition, we
adjusted for maternal BMI categories (overweight/obese vs
normal weight) to assess an individual effect of folate. To
further address residual confounders, we performed propen-
sity score–matched sensitivity analyses31 that compared
maternal low folate concentration (<9 ng/mL; to convert to
nmol/L, multiply by 2.266) with adequate folate (range,
9-81.9 ng/mL). We further adjusted for child plasma folate
concentrations and examined combined effects of child
folate concentrations with maternal folate on the risk for
child OWO. Child age and sex were not included in the
regression model because they were already accounted for
when we defined the outcome variables. All statistical analy-
ses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute).

Results
This study was composed of 1517 mother-child pairs, includ-
ing 1019 black pairs (67.2%) and 290 Hispanic pairs (19.1%). In
all, 443 (29.2%) and 381 (25.1%) mothers were overweight and
obese in prepregnancy, respectively, and a total of 590 (38.9%)
children were OWO at ages 2 to 9 years. Overweight or obese
childrenhadhigherbirthweights,higherratesofformulafeed-
ing, and higher rates of maternal obesity and diabetes (Table 1).
Themedian(interquartilerange[IQR])formaternalplasma
folate concentrations was 13.6 ng/mL (IQR, 9-19.6 ng/mL).
Obesemothershadlowerfolateconcentrationscomparedwith
normal-weight mothers: the geometric means of folate con-
centrations in normal-weight, overweight, and obese moth-
ers were 13.5 ng/mL (95% CI, 12.9-14.2), 13.4 ng/mL (95% CI,
12.6-14.1), and 12.3 ng/mL (95% CI, 11.7-13.0), respectively
(Pfortrend = .03).Ratesoflow(Q1)folateconcentrationamong
normal-weight, overweight, and obese mothers were 24.0%,
24.8%, and 27.0%, respectively.
Maternal Folate Concentrations, Prepregnancy Obesity,
and Child OWO
Maternal plasma folate concentrations were inversely associ-
ated with child BMI z score and OWO, but the association was
nonlinear (Wald χ2 test P < .05). As shown in Figure 1A, there
was a steep rise in BMI z score for children whose mothers’
plasma folate concentrations were below the 25th percentile
(ie, 9 ng/mL). However, higher maternal folate concentra-
tions beyond the median value did not confer additional ben-
efits. Consistently, the increased risk for child OWO was mainly
concentrated in the lowest folate quartile (Figure 1B): the mul-

tivariate odds ratio was 1.50 (95% CI, 1.10-2.04) compared with
the higher quartiles (Table 2). Of note, very similar results were
observed before vs after the adjustment of birth weight.
As shown in Table 2 and Figure 2, there was a significant
combinedeffectofmaternalfolateconcentrationsandprepreg-
nancy obesity on offspring BMI z score and risk for OWO. Chil-
dren of obese mothers with low folate concentrations had a
0.89-unit increase (95% CI, 0.63-1.15) in BMI z score and a 3.05-
fold increased risk (95% CI, 1.91-4.86) for OWO compared with
those whose mothers with adequate folate concentration and
normal weight. However, there was no significant interaction
between maternal folate status and prepregnancy obesity
(P > .05). Given maternal obesity, children of mothers with ad-
equate folate concentrations were associated with a 43% re-
duction in the risk for OWO compared with children of moth-
ers with low folate concentrations (odds ratio, 0.57; 95% CI,
0.34-0.95; P = .03).
Maternal Folate Concentrations, Prepregnancy Obesity,
and Child Metabolic Biomarkers
As compared with adequate maternal folate concentrations,
low folate concentrations were associated with an increase in
the concentrations of insulin and leptin and a reduction in the
adiponectintoleptinratioinoffspring.Childrenofobesemoth-
ers with low folate concentrations had a 0.39-unit increase
(95% CI, 0.09-0.69) in plasma insulin z scores compared with
the group with adequate maternal folate concentrations and
normal maternal weight. A similar pattern was seen for leptin.
In contrast, the children of obese mothers with low folate con-
centrations were associated with a 0.43-unit decrease (95% CI,
0.17-0.70) in their adiponectin to leptin ratio z scores. Given
maternal obesity, the children of mothers with adequate fo-
late concentrations had a 0.27-unit decrease (95% CI, −0.07
to 0.61) in plasma insulin, a 0.32-unit decrease (95% CI, 0.03-
0.62) in leptin; and a 0.43-unit increase (95% CI, 0.14-0.72) in
adiponectin to leptin ratio z scores compared with children of
mothers with low folate concentrations (Table 3 and eFigure
2 in the Supplement). These associations were attenuated af-
ter further adjustment for child adiposity (eTable 2, eTable 3,
and eTable 4 in the Supplement).
Sensitivity Analyses to Assess Robustness of the Findings
The associations described here did not differ appreciably
across the following strata defined by child age (2-5 years vs
6-9years;eTable5andeTable6intheSupplement),race(black
only; eTable 7 in the Supplement), and gestation (preterm vs
termbirth;eTable8intheSupplement),orwithadditionalcon-
trolling for other prenatal and perinatal factors including
whethertheindexchildwasaplannedpregnancyandwhether
the index child was delivered by cesarean birth (eTable 9 and
eTable 10 in the Supplement). A propensity score–matched
analysis showed that low maternal folate concentrations
(<9 ng/mL), as compared with adequate concentrations
(9-81.9ng/mL),wereassociatedwithanincreasedriskforchild-
hood OWO (odds ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.04-1.86) (eTable 11 in the
Supplement). When child metabolic biomarkers were limited
within the first 2 years of life, the association between mater-
nal folate concentrations and child metabolic biomarkers were
not appreciably changed (eTable 12 in the Supplement).
Among 803 study children with postnatal folate concen-
trations, children had higher plasma folate concentrations
than their mothers (geometric mean: 16.5 ng/mL; 95% CI,

maternalprenatalnutritionalstatusmayplayanimportantrole
in child metabolic disorders.2,3
Our data revealed a nonlinear L-shaped association: ma-
ternalplasmafolateconcentrationinthelowestquartilewasas-
sociated with increased risk for offspring OWO. Above this
threshold, higher folate concentrations did not confer addi-
tional benefit, also suggesting a ceiling effect of folate. The
threshold concentration identified in this study exceeded the
clinical definition of folate deficiency (<4.4 ng/mL), which was
primarilybasedonthehematologicaleffectoffolate.32Ourfind-
ings are in agreement with a recent study33 that used a similar
approach to estimate an optimal population red blood cell fo-
late concentration for the prevention of neural tube defects.
Taken together, these findings underscore the need to estab-
lish optimal rather than merely minimal folate concentrations
for preventing adverse metabolic outcomes in offspring.
Our study suggests that adequate maternal folate concen-
trations could mitigate the adverse effects of maternal obe-
sity on child metabolic risk. We demonstrated that, given ma-
ternalobesity,theriskforchildOWOwasassociatedwitha43%
reduction if the mothers had adequate folate concentrations
compared with low folate concentrations.
Ourdataonmetabolicbiomarkerslendfurthersupporttothe
biologicalplausibilityofourfindings.Previousmechanisticstud-
ies indicate that factors that create an unfavorable cardiometa-
bolicintrauterineenvironment,suchasincreasedinsulinresis-
tance,elevatedglucoseconcentrations,andincreasedoxidative
stress, in obese mothers may lead to OWO in offspring.4,16,34,35
Consistently,wefoundthatchildrenwithobesemotherswhohad

(of an observational cohort) reported a positive association be-
tweenmaternalfolateconcentrationandoffspringhomeostatic
model assessment–insulin resistance.36 Notably, this study as-
sumed a linear association between maternal folate concentra-
tionandoffspringhomeostaticmodelassessment–insulinresis-
tance,anditdidnotanalyzethecombinedeffectofmaternalfo-
late and BMI on child metabolic risk. Our data suggest that
inadequate maternal folate concentrations may have deleteri-
ous long-term metabolic effects beyond fetal overgrowth and
child OWO, while adequate maternal folate concentrations can
counterbalance the detrimental effects of maternal obesity on
the offspring.

ing of blood sampling occurred randomly (any time during the

thus biased our results toward null.
Conclusions
We demonstrated an L-shaped association between maternal
folate concentrations and child metabolic risk, suggesting both
a threshold and a ceiling effect of folate. We found that low ma-
ternal folate concentrations during late pregnancy can in-
crease child metabolic risk as measured by BMI z score, OWO,
and metabolic biomarkers; conversely, sufficient maternal
folate concentrations can mitigate the detrimental effects of
maternal obesity on the offspring. Our findings underscore the
need to establish and ensure optimal rather than minimal ma-
ternal folate concentrations for preventing offspring adverse
metabolic outcomes, especially among obese mothers.
