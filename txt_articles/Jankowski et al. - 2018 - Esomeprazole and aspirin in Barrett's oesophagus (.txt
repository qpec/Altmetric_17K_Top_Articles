Summary
Background Oesophageal adenocarcinoma is the sixth most common cause of cancer death worldwide and Barrett’s 
oesophagus is the biggest risk factor. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of high-dose esomeprazole proton-pump 
inhibitor (PPI) and aspirin for improving outcomes in patients with Barrett’s oesophagus.
Methods The Aspirin and Esomeprazole Chemoprevention in Barrett’s metaplasia Trial had a 2 × 2 factorial design 
and was done at 84 centres in the UK and one in Canada. Patients with Barrett’s oesophagus of 1 cm or more were 
randomised 1:1:1:1 using a computer-generated schedule held in a central trials unit to receive high-dose (40 mg 
twice-daily) or low-dose (20 mg once-daily) PPI, with or without aspirin (300 mg per day in the UK, 325 mg per day 
in Canada) for at least 8 years, in an unblinded manner. Reporting pathologists were masked to treatment allocation. 
The primary composite endpoint was time to all-cause mortality, oesophageal adenocarcinoma, or high-grade 
dysplasia, which was analysed with accelerated failure time modelling adjusted for minimisation factors (age, Barrett’s 
oesophagus length, intestinal metaplasia) in all patients in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered 
with EudraCT, number 2004-003836-77.
Findings Between March 10, 2005, and March 1, 2009, 2557 patients were recruited. 705 patients were assigned to low-
dose PPI and no aspirin, 704 to high-dose PPI and no aspirin, 571 to low-dose PPI and aspirin, and 577 to high-dose PPI 
and aspirin. Median follow-up and treatment duration was 8·9 years (IQR 8·2–9·8), and we collected 20 095 follow-up 
years and 99·9% of planned data. 313 primary events occurred. High-dose PPI (139 events in 1270 patients) was superior 
to low-dose PPI (174 events in 1265 patients; time ratio [TR] 1·27, 95% CI 1·01–1·58, p=0·038). Aspirin (127 events in 
1138 patients) was not significantly better than no aspirin (154 events in 1142 patients; TR 1·24, 0·98–1·57, p=0·068). If 
patients using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were censored at the time of first use, aspirin was significantly 
better than no aspirin (TR 1·29, 1·01–1·66, p=0·043; n=2236). Combining high-dose PPI with aspirin had the strongest 
effect compared with low-dose PPI without aspirin (TR 1·59, 1·14–2·23, p=0·0068). The numbers needed to treat were 
34 for PPI and 43 for aspirin. Only 28 (1%) participants reported study-treatment-related serious adverse events.
Interpretation High-dose PPI and aspirin chemoprevention therapy, especially in combination, significantly and 
safely improved outcomes in patients with Barrett’s oesophagus.

Introduction
The incidence of oesophageal adenocarcinoma has 
increased substantially in North America and Europe over 
the past 40 years.1 Although incidence might be plateauing, 
areas such as Hawaii are still seeing annual increases of 
8%.1 There are over 52 000 cases of oesophageal 
adenocarcinoma worldwide each year and 5-year survival 
is less than 10% when detected through symptoms. 
Increasing incidence of oesophageal adeno 
carcinoma is 
probably related to the rise in gastro-oesophageal reflux 
disease in high-income countries, especially in populations 
of European descent.2–5
Gastro-oesophageal reflux is one of the main risk factors 
for Barrett’s oesophagus, in which a portion of the 
oesophagus that is usually lined with squamous epithelium 
undergoes metaplastic change to become columnar 
mucosa. Barrett’s oesophagus is a com 
plex, genetically 
predisposed, premalignant condition6 that affects 2% of 
the adult population in western countries and can progress 
to adenocarci 
noma, follow 
ing the sequence oesophagitis-
metaplasia-dysplasia-adenocarcinoma.7,8 Surveillance of 
Barrett’s oeso 
phagus to detect early stage cancer has been 
associated with only a modest improvement in the outlook 
of oesophageal adenocarcinoma.9 Strategies to prevent 
progression to oesophageal adenocarcinoma could have a 
substantial impact in the same way that screening for 
colorectal cancer has proved successful in reducing 
colorectal cancer deaths.10
Early detection of Barrett’s oesophagus is confined to 
research settings; however, there are promising chemo-
prevention strategies. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) 
effectively reduce acid reflux, which is thought to be one of 
the main drivers of Barrett’s oesophagus. After the 
development of Barrett’s oesophagus, PPIs downregulate

cyclogoxygenase-2 expression, which might protect against 
neoplastic progression.11 Observational data have suggested 
that patients with Barrett’s oesophagus who are taking 
PPIs have reduced neoplastic progression,12 but this is low-
quality, controversial evidence.13 A systematic review from 
2014 supports the view that power 
ful acid suppression 
could reduce risk of neoplasia.14 Esomeprazole is the most 
commonly used PPI in the USA, and allows the healing of 
oesophagitis without promoting clonal expansion of 
Barrett’s oesophagus.15 Observational data suggest that 
aspirin use is associated with reduced risk of oesophageal 
adeno 
carcinoma,16–19 but this is not a universal finding.20 
Finally, although Barrett’s oesophagus is a major risk 
factor for oesophageal adenocarcinoma, only a minority of 
patients with Barrett’s oesophagus die from oesophageal 
adeno 
carcinoma; most die from cardio 
vascular disease or 
chest infections.21 Preventive strat 
egies should ideally 
affect overall mortality.
No randomised trial has so far evaluated PPIs or 
aspirin for improving outcomes, including prevent-
ing neoplastic progression, in patients with Barrett’s 
oesophagus. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of these agents in the Aspirin and Esomepra-
zole Chemoprevention in Barrett’s metaplasia Trial 
(AspECT), especially their ability to reduce all-cause 
mortality, oesophageal adenocarcinoma, and high-grade 
dysplasia.
Methods
Study design and participants
AspECT is a phase 3, randomised prospective fac-
torial study of chemoprevention by aspirin and 
esomeprazole in patients with Barrett’s oesophagus. 
There were 84 centres across England, Scotland, Wales, 
and Northern Ireland, and one in McMaster Health 
Sciences Centre, Hamilton, ON, Canada. AspECT was 
approved by the Main Research Ethics Committee in 
the UK (REC reference P1/04/Q0603/1) and by the 
Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board in Canada 
(refer 
ence 06-2731). All participants provided fully 
informed written consent.
Participants were recruited by gastroenterologists 
and upper gastrointestinal surgeons through hospital 
clinics and endoscopy lists, including new and existing 
Barrett’s oesophagus diagnoses. Individuals aged 
18 years or older meeting the globally accepted criteria 
for Barrett’s oesophagus, at least 1 cm of histologically 
proven columnar-lined oesophagus,22 were eligible to 
participate. Exclusion criteria included pre-existing 
oesophageal adenocarcinoma, high-grade dysplasia, or 
taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) 
at baseline. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria 
are provided in the appendix. Because women with 
Barrett’s oesophagus have a lower risk of oeso 
phageal 
adenocarcinoma than do men,22 we limited recruitment 
of women to approximately 500.
Randomisation and masking
Participants were randomised 1:1:1:1 in a 2 × 2 factorial 
design to receive esomeprazole at either high or low 
dose, with or without aspirin. Randomisation was done 
using a computer-generated schedule administered by a 
central trials unit to maintain allocation concealment. 
Some patients had contraindications to or were already 
taking aspirin for cardiovascular secondary prevention. 
We allowed these participants to enter PPI randomisation 
only. We therefore expected more participants in the PPI 
than the aspirin randomisation. Randomisation was by

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We did a very large systematic review of the world literature 
using a Delphi process, which has been published previously 
(Bennett C, et al. Am J Gastroenterol 2015; 110: 662–82). This 
search covered more than 20 000 papers in English, with hand 
searching of over 500 other non-English papers. We designed 
the scope, proposed statements, and searched electronic 
databases resulting in 20 558 papers that were screened, 
selected online, and formed our evidence base. We used a 
Delphi consensus with an 80% agreement threshold using 
Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and 
Evaluation assessment to determine the quality of the evidence. 
We found no significant evidence to recommend the use of 
proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) and low-dose aspirin for 
prophylaxis in Barrett’s oesophagus. The review has been 
badged as formal NICE and NHS Evidence because of its rigour. 
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, AspECT is the largest randomised 
controlled trial of PPIs and aspirin in Barrett’s oesophagus of 
any kind and the largest chemoprevention trial of PPIs. It is 
one of the longest aspirin chemoprevention trials with more 
than 20 000 patient-years of follow up. It is also unique in that 
it has assessed the combination of two successful 
chemoprevention agents.
Implications of all the available evidence
High-dose PPI therapy (80 mg esomeprazole per day) 
prolonged time to the composite endpoint of all-cause 
mortality, oesophageal adenocarcinoma, and high-grade 
dysplasia in patients with Barrett’s oesophagus compared 
with low-dose PPI (20 mg per day). Aspirin also had an effect 
on these endpoints, but this was only significant when patients 
who received non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were 
censored from the analysis. Both treatments seemed to have 
an additive effect. Clinically significant side-effects were rare.

minimisation with a random element of 0·8. The mini-
misation factors chosen were possible risk factors for the 
development of high-grade dysplasia, adenocarcinoma, 
and death: length of Barrett’s oesophagus (tongue or 
<2 cm or ≥2 cm, ≤3 cm or >3 cm, and ≤8 cm or >8 cm), 
age (18–49, 50–59, 60–69, ≥70 years), and intestinal 
metaplasia (yes or no). Using minimisation with the 
same variables, women and men were randomly 
assigned to treatment separately, as were those 
participants who only took part in the PPI randomisation. 
Treatment was not blinded.
Procedures
Patients received esomeprazole at either a high dose 
(40 mg capsules twice-daily) or a low dose (20 mg 
capsules once-daily). Patients who were assigned aspirin 
received one standard-dose tablet per day (300 mg in the 
UK, 325 mg in Canada). At follow-up visits, which 
occurred once per year starting from enrolment 
(±3 months), all patients were asked about hospital 
admissions and medical records were checked for 
serious adverse events. Follow-up in years 1, 3, 5, 7, and 
9 was by face-to-face or telephone interview, and in 
years 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, patients underwent endoscopy. 
All centres were trained and centrally monitored for 
endoscopy and pathology quality: strict adherence was 
essential for both site set up and for individual 
participant recruitment, with inclusion criteria  being 
validated by a trial office using faxed or scanned 
endoscopy and pathology forms before enrolment. 
Trial endoscopists received training in the use of the 
Prague C and M criteria for diagnosis and grading of 
Barrett’s oesophagus with central monitoring of images 
and videos.23 Standardised pathology criteria for 
reporting Barrett’s oesophagus biopsies were de-
veloped, with training overseen by a central pathology 
panel as reported previously.24 At each endoscopy, four-
quadrant biopsies were taken every 2 cm along the 
areas of Barrett’s oesophagus, with separate targeted 
biopsy of any macroscopic abnormalities. Biopsies were 
fixed in buffered formalin, transported to the pathology 
lab, processed within 24 h, embedded in wax, cut, 
stained with haematoxylin and eosin and assessed by 
local 
gastrointestinal 
pathologists. 
All 
pathology 
diagnoses of high grade dysplasia and adenocarcinoma 
were double reported by a second pathologist at trial 
centres (RCPath best practice). A 10% audit of all trial 
centre pathology diagnoses, including high proportions 
of high grade dysplasia and adenocarcinoma cases, was 
undertaken by a central trial pathology review panel24 
with complete agreement for cases of high grade 
dysplasia and adenocarcinoma. Reports were seen by 
the local clinical team and decisions were implemented, 
then faxed to the central trial office for validation and 
checking. All centres in all countries adhered to the 
same protocol except for the differing doses of aspirin 
between the UK and Canada.
Outcomes
The co-primary aims were the efficacy of high-dose PPI 
versus low-dose PPI, and the efficacy of aspirin versus no 
aspirin. The primary composite endpoint was time to the 
all-cause mortality, oesophageal adenocarcinoma, or 
high-grade dysplasia, whichever occurred first. Secondary 
aims (which were not fully powered) included each 
treatment’s effect on time to the individual components 
of the composite endpoint, cause-specific mortality, and 
the composite endpoint analysed by sex. Secondary 
outcomes that are not reported in this Article were 
molecular risk factors in Barrett’s oesophagus for the 
development of oesophageal adenocarcinoma, the cost 
effectiveness of aspirin and PPI treatment, whether 
intervention with PPI or aspirin induces changes in the 
expression of molecular markers for oesophageal 
adenocarcinoma, the genomics of aspirin sensitivity, 
how quality of life is affected by the different treatments, 
and the biological risk factors for cardiac disease and 
aspirin resistance.
Statistical analysis
We used intention-to-treat analysis for all efficacy analyses, 
analysing all partici 
pants who underwent randomisation 
and did not rescind consent in the treatment groups they 
were assigned to. We checked the significance of the 
treatment interaction term by first adding an interaction 
term to a primary model before using at-the-margins and 
within-table results to produce an interaction ratio. While 
we recognise that the power was low for this interaction 
comparison, we concluded that an analysis using the 
factorial design was appropriate.
All analyses used accelerated failure time (AFT) 
modelling, with adjustment for minimisation factors. 
The accelerated failure time models were interpreted in 
terms of the time to an event using the time ratio (TR). 
A TR greater than 1 for the composite endpoint implied 
that the treatment prolonged the time to an event. We 
used AFT because of the intuitive nature of the TR, 
which models survival time, its benefit being that results 
are reported as a delay to an event over the entire trial 
period compared with the hazard ratio result, which is 
interpreted as risk of an event at any one given time. 
Cox proportional hazards survival analyses, and where 
appropriate, Cox competing risks survival analyses 
were also performed on all comparisons to allow for 
comparison with other research. Before the use of 
both AFT and Cox survival models, the assumption of 
proportional hazards was tested with Schoenfeld tests 
and plots of residuals.
Median follow-up was calculated using a reverse 
Kaplan-Meier method.25
The trial aimed to recruit 5000 participants (1250 in 
each intervention group), assuming there was no 
interaction between the effects of aspirin and PPI 
interventions, an exponential time-to-composite-event 
with a constant event rate of 0·76% per year, a composite

event hazard ratio of 1·4, recruitment over 2 years, 
follow-up for 8 years, 10% loss to follow-up, 20% non-
compliance with medication, 80% power, and a 2-sided 
test at 5% significance. In October, 2008, at the trial 
steering committee, data safety and monitoring com-
mittee, and funder’s request, sample size was amended 
to allow emerging external data to be incorporated into 
the statistical calculations, namely published evidence 
showing a larger effect of aspirin (the raw data was 
available pre-publication with permission because JJ was 
a co-author)27 and a higher conversion rate to cancer than 
previously expected, and the realisation that the initial 
composite event rate was too cautious.21 It was agreed 
that it would be more efficient and cost-effective to 
decrease the recruitment target but extend follow-up to 
10 years to allow more events to accrue in the ageing trial 
population. The new sample size of 2224 participants 
(196 events) was based on the original calculations, but 
with amendments to the constant event rate for the 
composite event (death, cancer or high-grade dysplasia) 
to a conservative 1% per year, the composite event hazard 
ratio to 1·5, recruitment to 3 years, follow-up for a 
maximum of 10 years, and the adjustment for medication 
compliance removed. With the agreement of the trial 
steering committee and data safety and monitoring 
committee, the funder permitted the trial to recruit until 
the end of February, 2009, or until 2224 participants, had 
been accrued, whichever was later.
The primary outcome was analysed and presented 
confidentially to the trial’s data safety monitoring 
committee as specified in the protocol after 2 and 4 years 
of follow-up as interim analyses, with a p value less than

or equal to 0·001 regarded as significant. The committee 
recommended trial continuation and neither interim 
analysis was disseminated further.
UK sites also collected information on NSAID use. As 
specified in the statistical analysis plan, we did an 
analysis including only UK participants and censored 
follow-up when a participant began taking NSAIDs. We 
could then compare aspirin use with no aspirin, in the 
absence of NSAIDs.
The 2 × 2 factorial design provides two co-primary 
comparisons, high-dose PPI compared with low-dose PPI, 
and aspirin compared with no aspirin. Secondary analyses 
of each element of the composite endpoint (high-grade 
dysplasia, oesophageal adenocarcinoma, all-cause mor-
tality) were evaluated in the same way as the primary 
comparisons using both AFT and Cox survival analyses. 
A per-protocol population was defined based on treatment 
and trial compliance, as detailed in the appendix, with all 
analyses repeated as per primary methods. There were no 
missing data present in variables used in the primary and 
secondary analyses. No adjustments were made to any 
analyses for multiple testing. Number needed to treat 
(NNT) and number needed to harm were calculated as 
one divided by the  absolute risk difference of the primary 
event or adverse event, respectively. Safety data are 
presented in descript 
ive form without further statistical 
analysis. All analyses were done with Stata version 15.0.

Results
We recruited 2557 patients with Barrett’s oesophagus 
from March 10, 2005, to March 1, 2009, and followed 
them up for a median of 8·9 years (IQR 8·2–9·8), 
collecting 20 095 patient-years of data. The number of 
patients recruited, 2557, was 15% over the minimum 
power needed. 705 patients were assigned to low-PPI 
and no aspirin, 704 to high-PPI and no aspirin, 571 to 
low-PPI and aspirin, and 577 to high-PPI and aspirin 
(figure 1). 313 primary endpoint events occurred. Follow-
up was completed by March 1, 2017 (figure 1; appendix). 
Baseline characteristics are shown in table 1 and the 
appendix and compliance with medication is shown in 
the appendix. The trial achieved a data return rate 
of 99·9%, with only one case report form outstanding 
out of 66 200. Intestinal metaplasia was found in 
2266 (89%) patients at initial endoscopy, with the 
remainder having a mosaic of gastric metaplasia, increa-
sing to 100% with intestinal metaplasia on subsequent 
endoscopies.24,26
The PPI-aspirin interaction term was not significant 
(p=0·2807, n=2280, TR 1·30, 95% CI 0·81–2·09), so we 
analysed the PPI and aspirin comparisons separately. 
Event rates in each group are shown in the appendix.
In the primary analysis for PPI (figure 2A), the high 
dose (139 events in 1270 patients) was significantly more 
effective than the low dose (174 events in 1265 patients; 
TR 1·27, 95% CI 1·01–1·58, p=0·038). High-dose PPI 
significantly lengthened the time to reach outcome 
events, suggesting that high-dose PPI delays death, 
cancer, and high-grade dysplasia. If the expected time to 
the composite event while taking low-dose PPI was 
8 years (the original expected duration of treatment), 
taking high-dose PPI would increase this to 10·2 years 
(95% CI 8·1–12·6).
In the primary analysis for aspirin (figure 2B), the 
effect of aspirin (127 events in 1138 patients) was 
not significantly different from that with no aspirin 
(154 events in 1142 patients; TR 1·24, 95% CI 0·98–1·57, 
p=0·068). In this subgroup, aspirin (125 events in 
1116 patients) was significantly better than no aspirin 
(150 events in 1120 patients) for the composite endpoint 
when not combined with NSAIDs (TR=1·29, 95% CI 
1·01–1·66, p=0·043).
The effects of PPI and aspirin seemed to be additive 
when taken in combination (figure 2C). The largest 
difference was in the comparison of combined aspirin 
and high-dose PPI (52 events in 572 participants) with

low-dose PPI and no aspirin (99 events in 699 participants; 
TR 1·59, 95% CI 1·14–2·23, p=0·0068). We also com-
pared the effect of aspirin combined with high-dose PPI 
(52 events in 572 patients) with that of high-dose PPI 
alone (87 events in 698 patients), which gave a TR to 
endpoint of 1·38 (0·98–1·94, p=0·0680). The confidence 
interval suggests support for this effect, although it was 
not statistically significant as the trial was not powered 
for this analysis.
Table 2 shows the results of the secondary analyses. 
High-dose PPI decreased all-cause mortality compared 
with low-dose PPI. For high-grade dysplasia (the precursor 
lesion to oesophageal adenocarcinoma), the comparison of 
aspirin versus no aspirin gave a TR of 1·51 (95% CI 
1·00–2·29, p=0·053). 
We designed the trial to use accelerated failure time 
modelling and give TRs, because these are easier to 
interpret than other estimates. The appendix includes 
the results from a Cox model with hazard ratios to allow 
for comparison with the results of other studies. The 
appendix also includes Kaplan Meier plots for effects 
on all-cause mortality and high-grade dysplasia or 
oesophageal adenocarcinoma separately, respectively, for 
aspirin versus no aspirin and high-dose PPI versus low-
dose PPI. In the secondary analysis, PPIs had a significant 
effect on all-cause mortality.
We calculated the NNT to prevent high-grade dysplasia, 
adenocarcinoma, or death with both primary therapies 
(aspirin vs no aspirin, low-dose PPI vs high-dose PPI). In 
the aspirin comparison, we estimated that, on average, 
43 patients would need to be treated with aspirin to 
prevent one event (95% CI 20–250). In the PPI 
comparison, we calculated an NNT of 34 (18–333) for 
high-dose PPI—ie, 34 patients would need to be treated 
with high-dose PPI instead of low-dose PPI to prevent 
one event.
1132 serious adverse events occurred in 718 participants, 
of which 65 serious adverse events in 61 participants 
were considered to be related to one or both treatments. 
Those with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events grade 3–5 events are shown in table 3. Only 
28 (1%) participants had a serious adverse event 
of  grade 3–5 that was related to a study treatment 
(table 3; appendix). 64 episodes of haemorrhage were 
recorded in 59 patients, with more events in the 
aspirin groups (38 patients receiving aspirin and 
21 patients not receiving aspirin), but less than 1% 
(20 patients) of all patients experienced a grade 3–5 bleed. 
Seven grade 3–5 gastro 
intestinal bleeds were reported 
across seven patients (appendix). In total, there were 
303 serious adverse events among the 704 patients 
receiving high-dose PPI versus 274 events among the 
571 patients receiving high-dose PPI and aspirin 
combination, with little difference in the proportion of 
patients with severe adverse events between the groups. 
Of the most severe grade 3–5 adverse events, there were 
15 related to aspirin and 13 related to PPI.

Discussion
To our knowledge, AspECT is the first randomised trial 
to evaluate PPI and aspirin chemoprevention in Barrett’s 
oesophagus and the largest randomised trial of Barrett’s 
oesophagus ever done, with 20 095 participant-years of 
follow-up in 2557 patients. We have shown that high-
dose PPI use protects against a composite endpoint of 
all-cause mortality, oesophageal adenocarcinoma, and 
high-grade dysplasia. Aspirin use also protected against 
the composite endpoint when patient follow-up was 
censored at start of concomitant NSAID use. The data 
suggest the effects of the two therapies are additive, as 
the group who took both high-dose PPI and aspirin 
had the strongest benefit. High-dose PPI seemed to 
confer the single biggest effect, and combination with 
aspirin added another 38% to the time to an event. Both 
agents were well-tolerated with few serious adverse 
events. It seems likely that the use of aspirin and PPI 
would improve survival in Barrett’s oesophagus if given 
for at least 9 years.
This study has several limitations. Because we assessed 
only a small fraction of patients with Barrett’s oesophagus 
in predominantly white populations in five countries, 
our results might not be fully generalisable to all ethnic 
populations. However, Barrett’s oesophagus is currently 
most common worldwide in white populations. We also 
limited the study to only about 500 women. Although our 
drug treatment was not blinded, the outcomes of 
oesophageal adenocarcinoma and all-cause mortality are 
objective and unlikely to be biased by lack of blinding, 
even taking potential placebo or nocebo effects into 
account. A masked pathology panel with double reporting 
was used to minimise bias in evaluating high-grade 
dysplasia and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. 255 patients 
took part only in the PPI randomisation because they 
were aspirin intolerant or not able to stop taking aspirin, 
so, given that this was a non-selected patient group, this 
is a more generalisable group reflecting the situation in 
the population at large; since these patients were 
randomly assigned to low-dose PPI and high-dose PPI, 
we would not expect an effect on the PPI comparison.

The 95% CIs are wide and the lower limit was close to 
1 when each drug was evaluated individually, suggesting 
that the results are not robust. Aspirin and NSAIDs are 
available over the counter, so participants could have 
taken these drugs without reporting this to the 
investigator. However, this would have biased the results 
towards the null hypothesis and therefore would only 
underestimate aspirin’s efficacy.
Our data are supported by a meta-analysis of selected 
randomised controlled cardiovascular prevention trials 
evaluating aspirin versus placebo, which found that 
oesophageal adenocarcinoma was reduced in parti 
cipants 
taking aspirin.17 There are, however, concerns about 
these data,18 and the studies included in the meta-analysis 
did not investigate patients with Barrett’s oesophagus. 
Nevertheless, our data add support to the possibility that 
aspirin prevents oesophageal adenocarci 
noma. Although 
a systematic review of observational studies suggested 
that PPI therapy reduces the risk of oesophageal 
adeno 
carcinoma and high-grade dysplasia,14 these results 
are liable to the bias or confounding inherent to 
observational studies.
Our results with PPI are supported at the physiological 
level by studies showing that twice-daily PPI produces 
more effective suppression of acid reflux than once-daily 
dosing and, more provocatively, that high-dose PPI also 
allows preferential healing of Barrett’s oesophagus 
segments into squamous epithelium.15,28 There is little 
data in the literature on combining PPI and aspirin to 
prevent neoplastic progression of Barrett’s oesophagus, 
and these are the first randomised trial data to suggest the 
two drugs might have additive effects.
Our results have implications for clinical practice. 
Current guidelines in the UK and North America for 
Barrett’s and reflux oesophagitis propose that the “lowest 
effective dose to minimise reflux symptoms should be 
used”.22,29 Our data indicate that high-dose PPI (40 mg 
twice-daily) is better than low-dose (20 mg once-daily) for 
patients with Barrett’s oesophagus in terms of delaying 
death, cancer, and dysplasia. Our data also suggest that 
300 mg or 325 mg daily aspirin is effective for the 
composite endpoint, although we do not know if this is 
the optimal dose. The NNTs for high-dose PPI and aspirin 
are 34 and 43, respectively, to prevent one event. 
Combining high-dose PPI and aspirin seems to be more 
effective in reducing the composite endpoint than either 
treatment alone. The combination appears safe, with only 
1% of participants reporting a serious adverse event of 
grade 3–5, with little increase in adverse events when 
adding aspirin to high-dose PPI. Current guidelines do 
not address the possibility of giving aspirin to reduce 
neoplastic progression in patients with Barrett’s oeso-
phagus; our results suggest that a review of the existing 
guidelines is warranted.
Several questions remain unanswered. How long must 
patients take the combination of PPI and aspirin to benefit 
from any chemopreventative effects on oesophageal stem 
cells? Before 5 years, neither therapy had a significant 
benefit,19 but that after 8·9 years of follow-up, the effect 
was significant. We also do not yet know the pharma-
cogenomics underlying who responds best to either or 
both of these therapies,8 although investigations on this 
are underway.30 These data also raise the possibility that all 
patients needing long-term PPI to control reflux symp-
toms might benefit from the co-prescription of aspirin 
with acid suppression. PPI could reduce the upper 
gastrointestinal bleeding associ 
ated with aspirin whilst 
the benefits of aspirin re 
main. This hypothesis should be 
investigated in large population-based trials.
