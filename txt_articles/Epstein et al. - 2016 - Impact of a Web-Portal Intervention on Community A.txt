abstract
BACKGROUND: The quality of care for children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD) delivered in community-based pediatric settings is often poor. Interventions have 
been developed to improve community-based ADHD care but have not demonstrated 
that better care results in improved patient outcomes. The objective of this study was to 
determine whether an ADHD quality improvement (QI) intervention for community-based 
pediatric practices improves patient outcomes.
METHODS: A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted in which 50 community-
based pediatric primary care practices (213 providers) were randomized either to receive 
a technology-assisted QI intervention or to a control condition. The intervention consisted 
of 4 training sessions, office flow modification, guided QI, and an ADHD Internet portal to 
assist with treatment monitoring. ADHD treatment processes and parent- and teacher-rated 
ADHD symptoms over the first year of treatment were collected for 577 patients.
RESULTS: Intent-to-treat analyses examining outcomes of all children assessed for ADHD 
were not significant (b = –1.97, P = .08). However, among the 373 children prescribed ADHD 
medication, there was a significant intervention effect (b = –2.42, P = .04) indicating greater 
reductions in parent ratings of ADHD symptoms after treatment among patients treated 
by intervention physicians compared with patients treated at control practices. There 
were no group differences on teacher ratings of ADHD symptoms. ADHD treatment care 
around medication was significantly better at intervention practices compared with control 
practices.
CONCLUSIONS: A technology-assisted QI intervention improved some ADHD care quality 
and resulted in additional reductions in parent-rated ADHD symptoms among patients 
prescribed ADHD medications.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Although 
successful interventions have been developed to 
address the quality of attention-defi
 cit/hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD) care in community pediatric settings, 
these efforts have not demonstrated that improved 
ADHD care translates into better outcomes for 
patients with ADHD.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This cluster randomized 
controlled trial demonstrates that use of a 
technology-assisted quality improvement intervention 
not only improves the quality of some ADHD care 
delivered in pediatric settings but also results 
in greater medication-related ADHD symptom 
reductions according to parent ratings.

Approximately 7% to 9% of 
elementary school–age children 
in the United States are diagnosed 
with attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD). 
1, 
 
2 Most of these 
children receive their ADHD care 
from primary care providers (eg, 
pediatricians 
3, 
 
4). Unfortunately, 
ADHD care quality in these settings, 
especially medication monitoring and 
titration, is often poor.5, 
 
6 For example, 
most children have no contact with 
their physician during the first month 
of medication treatment. 
5
Fortunately, there are several models 
for improving ADHD care delivered 
by pediatricians. 
7 
 
 
–11 Epstein 
and colleagues have developed 
a technology-assisted quality 
improvement (QI) intervention to 
address the quality of community-
based pediatricians’ ADHD care. 
12 
A pilot study of this intervention 
demonstrated improved ADHD care 
quality consistent with American 
Academy of Pediatrics ADHD 
guidelines across a diverse set of 
practices. 
13
To date, all community-based ADHD 
care interventions have focused on 
ADHD care quality (ie, physician 
behaviors) as the primary outcome. 
However, it has not been established 
that improved care quality leads 
to improved patient outcomes. 
In this large, cluster-randomized 
controlled trial, we examined the 
effectiveness of a technologically 
assisted QI intervention at improving 
patient outcomes for elementary 
school–age children with ADHD. 
We predicted that children cared 
for by pediatricians trained on this 
intervention would have significantly 
greater ADHD symptom reduction 
compared with those receiving 
typical care.
METHODS
Participants and Settings
Mailings were sent to 128 practices 
in central and northern Ohio inviting 
their participation in a study of 
ADHD care QI. From August 2010 
to December 2012, the first 50 
pediatric practices that responded 
and met our inclusion and exclusion 
criteria (ie, has ≥2 physicians, uses 
an electronic billing system, office 
has Internet access, must not have 
colocated mental health care) were 
selected to participate (see  
Fig 
1). These practices included 195 
pediatricians, 4 nurse practitioners, 
and 14 pediatric resident physicians. 
Among nonresidents, mean provider 
age was 43.3 (SD 9.5) years, 15% 
were nonwhite, and 62% were 
female. The average time since 
training completion was 12.8 years 
(SD 9.1). There was diversity in terms 
of practice location (urban: 30.6%; 
suburban: 59.5%; rural: 11.1%) and 
population served (eg, proportions 
of Medicaid patients in their panels, 
range 0%–99%; mean 44.6%, SD 
30.5%).
Intervention
Practices randomly assigned to 
the intervention group received 
four 1-hour training sessions via 
Web conference. Two training 
sessions attended by all providers 
at the practice focused on evidence-
based ADHD care per the American 
Academy of Pediatrics ADHD 
guidelines. 
14 The remaining 2 
sessions were attended by all practice 
staff including providers and focused 
on how to complete systematic tests 
of change to improve the quality of 
ADHD care and use the ADHD Web 
portal (www. 
myADHDportal. 
com). 
Each practice selected an ADHD 
champion, typically an administrator 
or nurse, who coordinated activities 
at the practice.
At each intervention practice, ADHD 
patient flow was redesigned to center 
around a Web-based portal that 
facilitates the collection, scoring, 
and interpretation of parent- and 
teacher-ratings of ADHD symptoms 
and side effects. Providers were 
encouraged to register all of their 
patients with ADHD on the Web-
based portal, irrespective of whether 
they were enrolled in the research 
study. Providers can customize a 
schedule of rating scale collection 
for each patient after which ratings 
are automatically solicited from 
parents and/or teachers. When 
ratings are completed, automated 
algorithms score and interpret the 
data, and the physician receives 
a report with text, graphs, and 
tables charting patient response to 
medication. Furthermore, an online 
report card provides physicians with 
feedback on several key indicators of 
ADHD care (eg, time lapse between 
prescribing ADHD medication 
and collection of first parent and 
teacher rating scale). At 3, 6, 9, and 
12 months after training, study staff 
contacted the offices to prompt them 
to review their report cards. After 
identifying ADHD care behaviors 
in need of improvement, an ADHD 
care behavior was selected, and a 
test of change 
15 was implemented. 
By participating in this intervention, 
physicians earned maintenance 
of certification credit from the 
American Board of Pediatrics.
Study Design
The intervention requires modifying 
ADHD patient flow at the practice 
level, therefore a cluster randomized 
controlled trial was required. See 
 
Fig 1 for CONSORT (Consolidated 
Standards of Reporting Trials) 
diagram. Pairs of practices were 
matched according to number of 
providers in the practice and the 
percentage of Medicaid patients 
served. Within each pair, a practice 
was randomly assigned by a 
blinded research assistant using a 
random number generator to either 
immediate intervention or a wait-list 
control group. Practices were not 
blind to their assigned condition.
During the first year after 
randomization, pediatricians across

both groups identified patients 
under their care who were in 
grades 1 through 5, presenting for 
ADHD evaluation, and were ADHD 
medication naive. If families agreed, 
research staff called families and 
obtained verbal consent to participate. 
Across intervention and control 
practices, 2.4 (SD 3.1) and 3.6 (SD 
3.4) families per provider were 
enrolled respectively. After consenting 
and before treatment began, the 
Vanderbilt ADHD Parent Rating 
Scale 
16 was completed. Consent to 
contact the child’s teacher was also 
obtained, and teachers completed 
the Vanderbilt ADHD Teacher Rating 
Scale. 
17 Using the Vanderbilt Scales, 
which are based on the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 
Fourth Edition, parents and teachers 
rate each of 18 ADHD symptoms as 
occurring “never” (0), “occasionally” 
(1), “often” (2), or “very often” (3). 
An ADHD total symptom score (TSS; 
range 0–54) is derived by adding the 
18 symptom scores. Research staff 
members contacted the family at 
3, 6, and 12 months after the initial 
contact to readminister parent ratings. 
Because of changes in teachers across 
grades, collection of teacher ratings 
was only attempted at 3 and 6 months 
after baseline. Attempts to contact 
parents and teachers continued until 
data collection was completed in 
December 2014.
At the conclusion of the study, the 
patient’s medical chart and ADHD 
portal record (at intervention 
practices) were reviewed to 
document 1 year of ADHD care 
dating back to the first ADHD-related 
contact. Chart data included 
the following: (1) dates of any 
ADHD-related contacts (ie, office 
visit, phone, or e-mail); (2) dates, 
medication, dosage, and number 
of pills dispensed for any ADHD 
medication prescribed; and (3) dates 
of any ADHD parent- and teacher-
rating scales. Interrater reliability for 
chart reviews was calculated using a 
random sampling of 20% of patient 
charts, with intraclass correlations 
for continuous data and kappas for 
dichotomous data all exceeding 0.70.
To estimate medication continuity, 
the number of days covered by 
medication prescriptions (assuming 
a 7 days per week dosing schedule) 
was calculated and then converted 
to the proportion of days covered by 
dividing by the number of days from 
treatment start date until the end of 
the study. For children prescribed 
stimulant medication, the daily dosage 
for the final prescription written 
was calculated in methylphenidate-
equivalent milligrams by 
converting nonmethylphenidate 
stimulant medications using the 
following conversions: mixed salt 
amphetamines dose or Focalin dose × 
2; Vyvanse × 0.8.
The Cincinnati Children’s Medical 
Center and Nationwide Children’s 
Hospital Institutional Review Boards 
approved this study. Physicians gave 
written and parents gave verbal 
recorded, informed consent (over the 
phone) for participation.
Statistical Analyses
To compare rates of ADHD care 
across intervention and control 
practices, chart review data were 
analyzed by using 3-level mixed 
models (patients nested within 
providers, providers nested within 
practice, and variation across 
practices) using SAS Proc Mixed. 
Some ADHD care variables were 
measured by the number of days 
from when the patient was initially 
prescribed medication until a care 
event occurred (eg, time to first 
contact after being prescribed 
medication). When events did not 
occur, the observation was right-
censored. For these variables, Cox 
proportional hazards regressions 
(including clustering of patients 
under providers and providers 
under practices and using robust 
standard errors) were conducted 
comparing time-to-events across 
the intervention and control groups 
(function coxme in R Version 3.01). 
Because the goal of the intervention 
was to improve ADHD care around 
medication treatment, all analyses 
comparing ADHD care across 
intervention and control groups 
were limited to children who were 
prescribed ADHD medication (n = 
373).
Using the full sample (n = 577), an 
intent-to-treat analysis was conducted 
comparing patient outcomes across 
intervention and control groups 
using 4-level (repeated longitudinal 
assessments nested within patients, 
patients nested within care providers, 
care providers nested within 
practices, and variation across 
practices) mixed models (SAS Proc 
Mixed). Because the intervention 
was likely only to exert an effect

on patients receiving treatment, 
a second set of analyses were 
conducted by using only children who 
were prescribed ADHD medication 
(n = 373). Separate models were 
conducted for parent and teacher 
ratings. Baseline ratings were entered 
as a covariate. Postbaseline ratings 
were entered as dependent variables. 
The research team attempted to 
collect postbaseline ratings at 3, 6, 
and 12 months postbaseline. The 
actual dates when ratings were 
collected varied considerably (see 
Supplemental Table 2). Hence, in 
our analyses of patient outcomes, a 
time variable indicating the number 
of days postbaseline was entered to 
account for the multiple postbaseline 
time points. Group (intervention vs 
control) was entered to signify group 
status. The statistical significance of 
the main effect of group indicated 
intervention effects. Group × time 
interactions were included to test for 
differential posttreatment trajectories 
across groups. However, most long-
term ADHD medication studies show 
that the effects of medication on 
ADHD symptoms occur immediately 
(ie, within the first 3 months) and 
then are fairly stable. 
18, 
 
19 Hence, an 
interaction was not expected. Because 
no models produced significant 
interactions, these interaction effects 
were dropped from the models. To 
calculate effect sizes for significant 
effects in these multilevel models, the 
proportion of reduction in variance 
(PRV 
20) was calculated.
Missing Data
Though we collected baseline parent 
ratings of ADHD symptoms for the 
entire sample (n = 577), baseline 
teacher ratings were collected for 
only 64% (n = 367) of the sample. 
We collected at least 1 postbaseline 
parent rating and 1 postbaseline 
teacher rating for 90% and 74% of the 
sample, respectively. Rates of missing 
data across the intervention and 
control groups were not significantly 
different (all Ps > .5). There were a few 
demographic and clinical differences 
across those with and without missing 
data (see Supplemental Information). 
Multiple imputation was not used 
because, to our knowledge, there is no 
software that can impute data with 4 
levels of nesting.
Power
Monte Carlo simulation power 
analyses with 3 levels of nesting 
indicated we had 80% power to 
detect a Cohen’s d effect size of 0.20 
between intervention and control 
groups when examining ADHD care 
quality. For 4-level nesting, we had 
power of 0.80 to detect a between-
group unstandardized difference of 
2.0 and 2.6 on postbaseline parent and 
teacher ratings of ADHD symptoms 
in the intent-to-treat analyses. See 
Supplemental Information for power 
analysis details.

7.8 (SD 1.4) years of age, 70.5% were 
male, and 36.7% were nonwhite. 
Charts were reviewed for 574 patients. 
The 3 charts not reviewed were from a 
control practice. These reviews showed 
that 373 patients (165 at intervention 
practices; 208 at control practices) 
were prescribed ADHD medication 
in the year after initial presentation. 
Differences between intervention and 
control practices in patient age and sex 
were nonsignificant (see Supplemental 
Table 3). There was a race difference 
across groups in which the control 
group had a greater proportion of 
nonwhite children (42.3%) than the 
intervention group (29.8%; P < .01). 
Hence, all of the analyses examining 
intervention effects covary for race 
using a dichotomous white/nonwhite 
race indicator.
Among the 373 children who 
received ADHD medication, children 
at intervention practices had 
significantly more treatment contacts 
and more parent and teacher ratings 
to monitor medication treatment 
compared with children treated at 
control practices (see  
Table 1). Cox 
analyses indicated that after being 
prescribed medication, children at 
intervention practices had a shorter 
time to first contact (see  
Fig 2); 
however, this was due to use of 
phone contacts, not office visits, for 
the initial contact after prescribing 
medication (see  
Fig 3). Cox analyses 
also demonstrated the treatment 
outcomes of children at intervention 
practices were more quickly assessed 
with parent and teacher ratings 
during the first year of treatment (see 
 
Fig 2).
There were no group differences in 
the proportion of days covered by 
prescriptions (P = .09), the ultimate 
medication dosage among those 
prescribed stimulants (n = 342; 
P = .27) or time to first medication 
change (P = .17). Proportions of 
children meeting ADHD Healthcare 
Effectiveness Data and Information 
Set (HEDIS) measures across groups 
are reported in supplemental 
materials.
ADHD Patient Outcomes
Intent-to-treat analyses including all 
enrolled patients (n = 577; practice-
level interclass correlation [ICC] = 
0.04; provider-level ICC = 0.01; 
patient-level ICC = 0.40) revealed a 
statistically significant effect of race 
(b = 1.67, P > .009) but nonsignificant 
effects of time (b = –0.003, P = .06) 
and group (b = –1.97, P = .08).
Among children who were prescribed 
ADHD medication (n = 373; practice-
level ICC = 0.04; provider-level 
ICC = 0.01; patient-level ICC = 0.46), 
there was a significant effect of 
group (b = –2.42, P = .04) along with 
nonsignificant effects of race (b = 1.10, 
P = .14) and time (b = –0.001, P = .43) 
on parent ratings of ADHD symptoms. 
The estimate for the group effect 
indicates a 2.42-point incremental 
reduction in parent-rated ADHD total 
symptom scores for children treated 
at intervention practices compared 
with control practices ( 
Fig 4). The 
PRV effect size estimate indicated that 
compared with a null model (level 4 
TSS variance = 4.38), the inclusion

of treatment group as a predictor 
variable (level 4 TSS variance = 3.12) 
reduced response variable variance by 
29% (PRV = [4.38–3.12]/4.38 = 0.29).
Analyses described using parent 
ratings were repeated using teacher 
ratings. All group effects were 
nonsignificant.
DISCUSSION
The technology-assisted QI 
intervention had large effects 
on several indices of ADHD 
treatment care quality delivered 
by community-based providers. 
In particular, improvements were 
observed in physicians’ monitoring 
of their patients with ADHD during 
the initial year of treatment; 
gains consistent with previously 
reported intervention-related 
improvements. 
13 Compared with the 
usual care group, providers in the 
intervention group had 25% more 
patient contacts and collected 4.6 and 
9.9 times more parent and teacher 
ratings, respectively. However, even 
the quality of care achieved at the 
intervention practices left much 
room for improvement. For example, 
providers did not collect parent or 
teacher ratings during the initial year 
of ADHD medication treatment of half 
of their patients. Also, medication 
dosages were lower than what is 
achieved with optimal titration. 
21
Consistent with an extensive 
literature on ADHD medication 
efficacy, 
 
18, 
 
22 there were large 
reductions in parent-rated ADHD 
symptoms when newly diagnosed 
children with ADHD in both groups 
were prescribed ADHD medication 
(see  
Fig 4). The statistically 
significant incremental reduction 
(2.4 TSS points) in parent-rated 
ADHD symptoms over and above 
these medication effects reflects the 
incremental impact of improved 
quality of ADHD care on patient 
outcomes, achieved using our 
technology-assisted QI intervention. 
However, notably, intervention 
effects were not detected on teacher 
ratings of ADHD symptoms. It is 
possible that higher rates of missing 
data on teacher ratings led to 
reduced power to detect intervention 
effects.
Although we found that improved 
ADHD care improves parent-rated 
ADHD symptoms, the effects of 
our intervention were limited in 
that providers at the intervention 
practices did not consistently 
implement some standards of ADHD 
care. In fact, 7 of the 106 providers 
assigned to the intervention group 
did not register any children on the 
ADHD portal. Indeed, some of these 
care behaviors (eg, completion of 
rating scales) require parent and 
teacher compliance and access to 
the Internet in addition to provider 
action. For parents and teachers, 
education about the advantages of 
periodic visits and monitoring of 
their child’s medication treatment 
may help. Using technology (eg, 
online education materials) or 
7

peer support (eg, parent advocate) 
may spread this message more 
effectively to parents and teachers. 
For providers, while the ADHD 
portal intervention does alleviate 
some obstacles (eg, distribution 
and scoring of parent and teacher 
ratings), supplemental supports 
are likely necessary to facilitate 
consistent implementation. It may 
be that improving reimbursement 
for collection of these scales or 
according to compliance with specific 
standards of care may also reinforce 
reliable implementation of quality 
ADHD care. However, existing 
ADHD care quality standards such 
as the HEDIS measures may need 
to be reconsidered. In particular, 
the HEDIS measures rely heavily 
on office visits. Results of this 
intervention study suggest that 
increasing the rates and timing of 
any form of contact, either phone or 
visits, may improve child outcomes. 
Hence, less reliance on office visits 
and more emphasis on alternative 
forms of monitoring (eg, phone 
contacts, rating scale collection) for 
monitoring medication should likely 
be considered.
As is often the case with community-
based research studies, collection 
of research measures was difficult, 
largely due to the research staff 
having minimal contact with research 
participants. Therefore, data 
collection rates were compromised. 
Moreover, recruitment of patients 
and continued participation in 
research assessments was lower at 
intervention practices than control 
practices. One possible contributor 
to this disparity was the increased 
demands for providers to adopt 
the ADHD portal into practice and 
the increased demands among 
families to complete both clinical and 
research assessments. Additionally, 
although the participating practices 
were diverse in terms of geography 
and populations served, they 
all volunteered to participate 
in an ADHD QI study, so our 
results may not generalize to all 
practices and providers. Likewise, 
patients included only those who 
volunteered to participate, which 
also may limit generalizability of 
our findings. Another limitation 
was that our primary outcome 
was ADHD symptoms rather 
than functional impairments (eg, 
school performance), which are 
generally the reason that families 
seek treatment. 
23 The rationale for 
focusing on symptoms was that 
medication largely targets symptoms 
and typically does not produce 
change in function, particularly in 
community-based settings. 
19, 
 
24 To 
improve functioning, behavioral 
treatments must be employed. 
25, 
26 
This leads to a final limitation of 
this study: our intervention focused 
on medication and did not assist 
providers in accessing or delivering 
behavioral treatments.
CONCLUSIONS
Using a technology-assisted QI 
intervention improves some 
indicators of ADHD care quality 
(eg, frequent contacts, more rating 
scales collected) in community-based 
pediatric settings, which produces 
incrementally greater reductions 
in parent-rated ADHD symptoms 
among patients treated with 
medication compared with typical 
care. This intervention is largely 
Web-based, facilitating dissemination 
and adoption. Future goals for this 
intervention include extending the 
software to facilitate behavioral 
treatment and exploring strategies to 
enhance consistent implementation
