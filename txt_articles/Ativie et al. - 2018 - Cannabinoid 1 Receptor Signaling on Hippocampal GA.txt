Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, play important roles in defending the
brain against pathogens and supporting neuronal circuit plasticity. Chronic or excessive
pro-inflammatory responses of microglia damage neurons, therefore their activity is
tightly regulated. Pharmacological and genetic studies revealed that cannabinoid type
1 (CB1) receptor activity influences microglial activity, although microglial CB1 receptor
expression is very low and activity-dependent. The CB1 receptor is mainly expressed
on neurons in the central nervous system (CNS)—with an especially high level on
GABAergic interneurons. Here, we determined whether CB1 signaling on this neuronal
cell type plays a role in regulating microglial activity. We compared microglia density,
morphology and cytokine expression in wild-type (WT) and GABAergic neuron-specific
CB1 knockout mice (GABA/CB1−/−) under control conditions (saline-treatment) and
after 3 h, 24 h or repeated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treatment. Our results revealed
that hippocampal microglia from saline-treated GABA/CB1−/− mice resembled those
of LPS-treated WT mice: enhanced density and larger cell bodies, while the size
and complexity of their processes was reduced. No further reduction in the size or
complexity of microglia branching was detected after LPS-treatment in GABA/CB1−/−
mice, suggesting that microglia in naïve GABA/CB1−/− mice were already in an
activated state. This result was further supported by correlating the level of microglial
tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) with their size. Acute LPS-treatment elicited in both
genotypes similar changes in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα,
interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin 1β (IL-1β)). However, TNFα expression was still
significantly elevated after repeated LPS-treatment in WT, but not in GABA/CB1−/−
mice, indicating a faster development of tolerance to LPS. We also tested the
possibility that the altered microglia activity in GABA/CB1−/− mice was due to an
altered expression of neuron-glia interaction proteins. Indeed, the level of fractalkine
(CX3CL1), a neuronal protein involved in the regulation of microglia, was reduced
in hippocampal GABAergic neurons in GABA/CB1−/− mice, suggesting a disturbed
neuronal control of microglial activity. Our result suggests that CB1 receptor agonists
can modulate microglial activity indirectly, through CB1 receptors on GABAergic neurons.

Cannabinoid Signaling Influences Microglial Activity
Altogether, we demonstrated that GABAergic neurons, despite their relatively low density
in the hippocampus, have a specific role in the regulation of microglial activity and
cannabinoid signaling plays an important role in this arrangement.

INTRODUCTION
Microglia the resident immune cells of the central nervous
system (CNS), continuously survey their microenvironment
(Nimmerjahn et al., 2005) and contribute to the neuronal circuit
plasticity by phagocyting apoptotic neurons (Neumann et al.,
2009) and by participating in synaptic stripping (Wake et al.,
2009). In the presence of a pro-inflammatory stimulus they
become activated and are responsible for the active immune
defense within the CNS (Schuitemaker et al., 2012; Kaunzner
et al., 2012). A long-lasting or excessive inflammatory response
is neurotoxic leading to cognitive impairments (Tha et al., 2000;
Lynch, 2010), promotion of neurodegeneration (Perry et al.,
2010) and brain ageing (Finch, 2010; Villeda et al., 2011). Thus,
microglial activity is tightly controlled and fine-tuned in the brain
(Wolf et al., 2008). Neurons exert an inhibitory control on the
immune activity of microglia (Chavarría and Cárdenas, 2013)
through the expression of soluble regulatory factors (Pocock
and Kettenmann, 2007) and directly interacting surface proteins
(Hoek et al., 2000; Cardona et al., 2006; Bessis et al., 2007).
Pharmacological studies showed a significant effect of
cannabinoids on microglial activity. Cannabinoid receptor
agonists generally have a neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory
effect. In vitro studies using cultured microglia showed that
activation of the cannabinoid receptors by their endogenous
ligand anandamide (Tham et al., 2007) or by synthetic
receptor agonists (Romero-Sandoval et al., 2009) inhibited
the production of pro-inflammatory mediators and microglia
migration. Furthermore, in vivo modulation of cannabinoid
receptor signaling influenced microglial activity in models
of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. In the brain
of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated (Marchalant et al., 2007)
or in the spinal cord of paclitaxel-treated rats (Burgos et al.,
2012) the CB1/CB2 receptor agonist WIN-55212-2 reduced
the pro-inflammatory activity of microglia cells. In the mouse
model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis the
synthetic agonist CB52 slowed down Ribeiro et al. (2013),
while
the
cannabinoid
receptor
antagonist
SR141716A
accelerated the progression of neuroinflammatory changes
(Lou et al., 2018), both in a CB1 receptor-dependent manner. In
another study, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) prevented
3,4-Methylendioxy-N-methylamphetamin (MDMA)
induced
glial activation in wild-type (WT) control mice but not in mice
with either genetic or pharmacologic blockade of CB1 receptors
(Touriño et al., 2010), further supporting the importance of
CB1 receptors in the anti-inflammatory effect of cannabinoid
agonists.
The in vivo efficacy of CB1 agonists and antagonists is
surprising, because in resting/surveying microglia the expression
of cannabinoid receptors is very low, often below the detection
threshold (Stella, 2010). Microglia upregulates expression of
cannabinoid receptors when activated, therefore CB1 ligands
could have a direct effect on activated microglia in the late
phase of the inflammation. However, the cannabinoid agonist
KN38-72717 showed a higher efficacy of in the early phase
rather than in the late phase of the neuroinflammatory process
(Schmidt et al., 2012). Independent from the activity state,
the expression of CB2 receptors significantly exceeds the
expression of CB1 receptors (Stella, 2010). Activation of glial
CB2 receptors attenuates glial activity (Racz et al., 2008), prevents
neurodegeneration (Ullrich et al., 2007) and reduces symptoms
of Huntington’s disease (Palazuelos et al., 2009). These data
together suggest that in vivo the direct effect of cannabinoids
on glial activity is mediated primarily by CB2 and not by
CB1 receptors. As neurons control microglia cells (Chavarría
and Cárdenas, 2013), CB1 receptor agonists and antagonists
can influence microglial activity indirectly, by binding neuronal
CB1 receptors.
In the brain, the majority of CB1 expressing cells are neurons.
In the cortex and in the hippocampus high CB1 receptor
expressing cells are GABAergic neurons, whereas glutamatergic
principal neurons express CB1 receptors on a lower level
(Marsicano and Lutz, 1999). Histological analysis revealed that
roughly 90% of cholecystokinin-positive and 10% of calbindin-
positive interneurons express CB1 receptors on a high level
(Katona et al., 1999). Other GABAergic neuron subtypes like
the majority of the parvalbumin-positive interneurons are
CB1 negative (Katona et al., 1999).
It is of note that the G-protein coupling of CB1 receptors is
several fold more efficient in glutamatergic than in GABAergic
neurons, therefore the efficacy of cannabinoids is also higher
in this neuronal population (Steindel et al., 2013). Indeed,
the importance of CB1 receptors on glutamatergic neurons
in neuroprotection shows that deletion of CB1 receptors on
glutamatergic but not on GABAergic neurons exacerbates
quinolinic acid-induced excitotoxic damage and the progression
of striatal neurodegeneration in a mouse model of Huntington’s
disease (Chiarlone et al., 2014).
Glial cells not only receive cannabinoid signals but they also
express the enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation
of endocannabinoids (Carrier et al., 2004; Walter et al., 2004;
Muccioli et al., 2007). They produce cannabinoids such as
palmitoylethanolamide (Muccioli and Stella, 2008) and also the
endogenous ligands of the cannabinoid receptors anandamide
(Walter et al., 2003) and 2-AG (Witting et al., 2004). The
2-AG production is twenty times higher in microglia than
in neurons or astrocytes (Walter et al., 2003). The high
production of cannabinoids together with the high expression

Cannabinoid Signaling Influences Microglial Activity
level of CB1 receptors on neurons—especially on GABAergic
interneurons—suggests that the cannabinoid system can have a
role in microglia-neuron communication (Luongo et al., 2010).
A possible role of neuronal CB1 receptors in the regulation
of microglia shows that constitutive CB1 receptor knockouts
(Bilkei-Gorzo et al., 2005, 2012) and also GABAergic neuron-
specific CB1 knockout mice (Albayram et al., 2011) displayed
neuroinflammatory changes in the hippocampus in ageing. An
enhanced pro-inflammatory environment is known to contribute
to cognitive deficits (Lucin and Wyss-Coray, 2009; Ron-Harel
and Schwartz, 2009; Von Bernhardi et al., 2010). Thus, increased
pro-inflammatory activity of microglia could be responsible for
the reduction of long term potentiation (Monory et al., 2015)
and memory deficits (Albayram et al., 2016) in the CB1 knockout
lines.
However, it is not yet known how CB1 receptor signaling
on GABAergic neurons influences microglial activity in the
healthy brain and their activation by a pro-inflammatory
stimulus. Therefore, we compared microglia density, size and
cytokine expression in WT and GABAergic neuron-specific
CB1 knockout mice and compared the dynamics of microglia
activation in response to LPS-treatment between the genotypes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
The experiments were carried out with 3-month-old male
and female B6.cg Cnr1 tm1.2Ltz × Tg(dlx6a- cre)1Mekk mice
(Monory et al., 2006). In these mice, conditional deletion of
the floxed Cnr1 gene (encoding for CB1) is mediated by the
expression of a cre recombinase in forebrain GABAergic neurons
(here called GABA/CB1−/−). Cre transgenic mice therefore lack
CB1 receptors in GABAergic forebrain neurons. Cnr1 floxed
littermates were used as WT controls.
Mice were group housed under reversed light/dark cycle.
Food and water were provided ad libitum. Care of the
animals and conduction of the experiments followed guidelines
of European Communities Directive 86/609/EEC and the
German Animal Protection Law regulating animal research
and were approved by the LANUV NRW, Germany (Nr. 84-
02.04.2014.A422).
In vivo LPS Injections and Preparation of
the Brain
Mice received acute or repeated (once daily for four consecutive
days) intraperitoneal injections of 0.8 mg/kg LPS (Sigma) or
saline (control groups). Three or 24 h after the acute treatment
or 24 h after the last injection the mice were sacrificed.
For that, mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and
transcardially perfused with ice cold PBS. Brains were halved
and briefly washed in PBS. For the quantitative real-time PCR
one hemisphere was immersed in 1ml of TRIzol in Magna
Lyser tubes and snap frozen. For immunoblotting, hippocampi
of control mice were isolated and shock frozen on dry ice. For
histological analysis the half brains were post-fixed in 4% PFA in
PBS (pH = 6.9; Sigma-Aldrich) for 3–4 h at 4◦C, under shaking
(Notter et al., 2014). Hemispheres were then briefly washed with
PBS and cryoprotected by incubation in 20% sucrose solution
for up to 2 days. After that time, the excess of the sucrose
solution was removed and hemispheres were deep frozen in
dry-ice cooled isopentane. Samples were stored at −80◦C until
further processing.
Quantitative Real-Time PCR
The half brains (excluding the olfactory bulb) were lysed
in TRIzol (Life Technologies), and total RNA was extracted
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The quality of the
RNA was assessed by measuring the ratio of the absorbance
at 260 nm and 280 nm using a Nanodrop 2,000 Spectrometer
(Thermo Scientific). Probes with a 260/280 ratio less than
1.9 were rejected. cDNAs were synthesized using the SuperScript
First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR Kit (Invitrogen
Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA) with random hexamer primers. Total
RNA (0.6 µg) was used as starting material for cDNA synthesis.
Differences in mRNA expression were determined in triplicate by
custom TaqMan� Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems,
Darmstadt, Germany; interleukin-6 (IL-6): Mm00446190_m1;
interleukin 1β (IL-1β): Mm00434228_m1; tumor necrosis factor
(TNF):
Mm00443258_m1.
The
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH): Mm01334042_m1 was used as
an endogenous reference gene to standardize the amount
of target cDNA. Typically, a reaction mixture consisted
of 1× TaqMan� Gene Expression Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany), 2 µl cDNA and 1×
Custom TaqMan� Gene Expression Assay. Samples were
processed in a 7500 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Applied
Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) with the following cycling
parameters: 95◦C for 10 min (hot start), 40 cycles at 95◦C for
15 s (melting) and 60◦C for 1 min (annealing and extension).
Analysis was performed using the 7500 Sequence Detection
Software
version
2.2.2
(Applied
Biosystems,
Darmstadt,
Germany) and data were obtained as function of threshold
cycle (Ct).
Relative quantitative gene expression was calculated with the
2−ddCt method. Briefly: dCt was calculated for each assayed
sample by subtracting Ct of the housekeeping gene from the Ct
of the gene of interest. Mean dCt values of the saline-treated
WT mice were chosen as reference sample and subtracted from
dCt of the other groups (ddCt). Experimental mRNA abundance
relative to control mRNA abundance was finally calculated. The
animal numbers used for this analysis were as follows: single
LPS injection, killed 3 h later: seven in each group. Single LPS
injection, killed 24 h later: eight. Repeated LPS injection, killed
24 h after the last injection: six. We had to exclude one probe in
the WT saline-treated groups due to a technical error.
Immunohistochemistry
Frozen fixed hemispheres were cut with a cryostat (Microm
HM500) into 18 µm slices and stored at −20◦C. For the staining,
the slices were first permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in
PBS and unspecific binding sites were blocked with 3% BSA
in PBS. Slices were incubated with the primary antibody for
48 h at 4◦C and after washing with the secondary antibody

anti-mouse AF488 conjugated for the GAD67/CX3CL1 double
staining (1:1,000; Invitrogen; A21202). Finally, slices were
washed, embedded with DAPI containing medium (DAPI
Fluormount-G R, Southern Biotech) and covered. To test
microglia densities, we analyzed slices from six mice in
the single injected groups, six WT vehicle-injected and
GABA/CB1−/−
LPS injected, four WT LPS-injected and
five GABA/CB1−/− single injected mice. For the analysis of
microglia morphology, microglial TNF alpha expression and
GAD67 – CX3CL1 colocalization we used three mice for each
group.
Imaging and Image Analysis
For the analysis of microglia densities within the hippocampus,
images
were
acquired
using
a
Zeiss
Axio
Imager
two
epifluorescent microscope with 20× objective. To determinate
microglia density, the number of Iba1-positive (Iba1+) cells
within the hippocampus was counted and divided by the area of
the hippocampus. The average density was calculated from six
images per mouse, 4–6 mice were analyzed per group.
For the analysis of microglia morphology and TNFα
immunoreactivity, as well as GAD67/CX3CL1 double stainings,
images were acquired using a Leica TCS SP8 confocal
microscope with 63× objective. Z-stacks were taken with a step
size of 0.5 µm.
To determine microglia morphology, microglia cells were
automatically reconstructed in a three-dimensional way after
imaging acquisition. In order to this, a python-based software
was developed. Reconstruction were visually checked using the
ImageJ plugin ‘‘simple neurite tracer (ImageJ V2.0).’’ Each
reconstructed cell was individually extracted and the number
and length of branches, bifurcations and branch order were
quantified using the open source software l-measure (Scorcioni
et al., 2008). 20–25 randomly selected microglia from three
different slices were analyzed per mouse, three mice per group,
giving a total of 60–72 microglia per group.
The intensity of TNFα immunoreactivity in 20–25 microglia
per mouse was measured. For this analysis high magnification
histological pictures of microglia cells were taken in the
hippocampus of 3–3 wild-type and GABA/CB1−/− saline treated
mice, thus altogether 60–72 microglia cells were evaluated using
the Fiji software (ImageJ V2.0).
CX3CL1 immunoreactivity within hippocampal GAD67+
neurons was measured in WT and GABA/CB1−/− saline treated
mice (n = 3 per group, altogether 75 neurons), using the Fiji
software (ImageJ V2.0).
Determination of Neuron-Glia Interaction
Protein Levels Using Western Blotting
Frozen hippocampi of untreated WT and GABA/CB1−/− mice
were lysed in 1% SDS buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany)
containing protease inhibitor (Complete Mini, Roche), sonicated
and clarified by centrifugation (13,000 rpm for 10 min).
Protein concentrations were determined using BCA Protein
Assay Kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were run on
NuPAGE Bis-Tris 4%–12% gradient gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA). In preliminary experiments we determined the
range where the relation between the protein concentration and
signal intensity is linear for each antibody. The proteins were
subsequently blotted onto PVDF-membranes using the iBlot
Dry Blotting System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The blots
were incubated with primary antibodies to CD200 (bs-6030R;
1:1,000; Bioss Antibodies), CD200R (1:1,000; ab34097; Abcam),
CX3CL1 (1:1,000; ab25088; Abcam), CX3CR1 (1:1,000; C8354;
Sigma-Aldrich), Sirpa (1:1,000; ab53721; Abcam), CD47 (1:1,000;
sc25773; Santa Cruz) and with an antibody against GAPDH
(1:12,000; ab9484; Abcam). The blots were then incubated
with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, followed by
the ECL substrate (Pierce). Images were created using the
ChemiDoc Imaging System (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and the
quantification was performed using the ImageLab software
(Bio-Rad Laboratories). Signal intensities were normalized to
GAPDH.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed and visualized using GraphPad
Prism 6.0. For the gene expression analysis, to test hippocampal
microglia densities, sizes and morphology two-way ANOVA
(main factors: genotype, treatment) followed by Bonferroni test
was used. Additionally, we analyzed the effect of sex on microglia
activation in mice sacrificed 24 h after a single LPS injection
using three-way ANOVA main factors: genotype, treatment,
sex). For the analysis of correlation between microglia size
and TNFα content Pearson correlation analysis was used. To
compare the microglial TNFα levels, the level of CX3CL1 in
GABAergic neurons between the genotypes Mann-Whitney test
was used, for the analysis of Western blot data the Student t-test.
P-value < 0.05 was considered as significant.
RESULTS
Effect of Intraperitoneal LPS Injection
To compare the dynamics of the inflammatory reaction between
WT and GABA/CB1−/− mice, we injected with 0.8 mg/kg LPS
intraperitoneally and evaluated the gene expression level of
pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain three and 24 h after a
single injection and 24 h after a repeated daily injection of LPS
for 4 days.
Expression of Inflammatory Cytokines
The expression of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1β
and TNF α, each showed a strong increase 3 h after the LPS

injection in both genotypes (Figure 1, Table 1A). When we
tested the expression levels in the later phase of the reaction,
24 h after the LPS treatment, we found again a similar change
in LPS-treated mice, independent from the genotype: reduction
in the IL-6 and elevation in the IL-1 β and TNFα mRNA levels
(Figure 1, Table 1B). Sex of the mice also did not influence
the cytokine expression (Table 1B). Twenty-four hours after the
repeated, daily injection of LPS the IL-6 levels did not differ
between the LPS-treated and vehicle-treated controls. The IL-1
β and TNFα mRNA levels were elevated in the LPS-treated
WT mice, whereas in GABA/CB1−/− mice the expression of
TNF α was similar in vehicle- and LPS-treated mice (Figure 1,
Table 1C).
Microglia Density
As a further readout to assess microglial reactivity we
compared the density of Iba1+ cells in the hippocampus
between saline and LPS-treated mice from both genotypes.
As shown on the representative images (Figure 2A) the
Iba1+ microglia cells had the highest density in the stratum
lacunosum moleculare layer in each group. Microglia densities
did not differ between WT and GABA/CB1−/− mice (genotype
effect: F(1,20) = 2.140; p > 0.05) or between saline and
LPS-treated mice (treatment effect: F(1,20) = 0.528; p > 0.05)
in both genotypes (interaction: F(1,20) = 0.026; p > 0.05)
3 h after the LPS-treatment (Figure 2B). Twenty-four hours
after the LPS injection, however, we found a significant
increase in microglia densities in the LPS-treated group
(treatment effect: F(1,20) = 37.78; p < 0.001), similarly in WT
and GABA/CB1−/− mice (treatment × genotype interaction:
F(1,20) = 0.115; p > 0.05; Figure 2C). The effect of LPS was
more pronounced in males than in females (treatment × sex:
F(1,16)
= 6.425; p < 0.05), similarly in both genotypes
(treatment × sex × genotype: F(1,16) = 0.031; p > 0.05). The
density values were higher in the conditional knockouts than in
their WT littermates (genotype effect: F(1,20) = 29.10; p < 0.001)
in both sexes (genotype × sex: F(1,16) = 0.020; p > 0.05).
We found a similar picture after repeated LPS-injections
as 24 h after the single injection (Figure 2D): significantly
increased microglia in the LPS-treated mice (treatment effect:
F(1,17) = 46.75; p < 0.001) in both genotypes (interaction:
F(1,17) = 1.506; p > 0.05) and significantly bigger microglia
in GABA/CB1−/− mice (genotype effect: F(1,17) = 25.34;
p < 0.01). We also wanted to know whether microglia
densities differ between the genotypes in control, saline-
treated mice, but post hoc analysis of the data did not give
a clear answer. Thus, we re-analyzed density data of the
saline-treated mice from all three experiments using two-way
ANOVA with genotype and experiment as main factors. This
analysis showed that microglia densities are higher in control
GABA/CB1−/− than in WT mice (genotype: F(1,29) = 17.63;
p < 0.001; genotype × experiment interaction: F(2,29) = 1.862;
p > 0.05).

to further analyze the effect of CB1 receptor signaling in
GABAergic neurons on microglial activity state, we compared the
microglia sizes, parameters of branch size (number and length
of branches) and parameters of branch complexity (number of
bifurcations and branch order) in the hippocampus of WT and
GABA/CB1−/− mice with and without LPS treatment.
Analysis of microglia sizes (Figure 3B) showed that 3 h
after the LPS injection there was no significant main effect
for genotype or treatment (genotype effect: F(1,586) = 0.393;
p > 0.05; treatment effect: F(1,586) = 2.745; p > 0.05), but we
found a significant interaction between genotype and treatment
(interaction: F(1,586) = 9.835; p < 0.01). Post hoc analysis revealed
that the microglia sizes increased after LPS-treatment only in WT
mice. It is of note that microglia in control GABA/CB1−/− mice
were also somewhat larger than in control WT mice. When we
assessed microglia size in mice 24 h after the LPS treatment,
we found significant genotype (F(1,553) = 16.51; p < 0.001)
and treatment effects (F(1,553) = 65.07; p < 0.001), but no
interaction (F(1,553) = 0.067; p > 0.05). Testing the effect of sex on
LPS-induced increase in microglia size revealed a rather complex
interaction: LPS had a higher effect in females than in males
(genotype × sex: F(1,549) = 23.30; p < 0.001), because microglia
sizes were lower in LPS-treated GABA/CB1−/− males than in
females (genotype × treatment × sex: F(1,549) = 19.21; p < 0.001).
Lastly, repeated injection of LPS led also to increased microglia
sizes (F(1,576) = 24.10; p < 0.001), which was not influenced by
the genotype (interaction: F(1,576) = 1.104; p > 0.05). There was
no genotype effect in this group (F(1,576) = 1.468; p > 0.05).
Similarly, as by the analysis of microglia densities there was
a significant difference between the saline-treated WT and
GABA/CB1−/− mice in two from the three studies. Thus, to
learn whether microglia sizes differ between the genotypes
without LPS-treatment we analyzed again our data from the
saline-treated groups using two-way ANOVA with genotype
and experiment as main effects. This analysis revealed that
microglia are bigger in control GABA/CB1−/− than in WT mice
(genotype: F(1,863) = 24.96; p < 0.001) independent from the
experiment (genotype × experiment interaction: F(2,863) = 2.080;
p > 0.05).
Detailed analysis of microglia branch morphology in mice
3 h after a single injection of LPS or vehicle revealed that
the total length of branches was less in GABA/CB1−/− mice
(genotype: F(1,209) = 5.178; p < 0.05). LPS-treatment reduced
branch length (treatment:F(1,209) = 15.17; p < 0.001), but this
reduction was significant only in the WT (−36.6%) but not
in the GABA/CB1−/− mice (genotype × treatment interaction:
F(1,209) = 25.14; p < 0.001; Figure 4A). Testing the number
of branches our analysis gave a similar result: less branches
(genotype: F(1,209) = 20.85; p < 0.001) and reduced reactivity
to LPS in the GABA/CB1−/− mice (genotype × treatment
interaction: F(1,209) = 17.58; p < 0.001; 38%, significant
reduction in WT mice and −2.2% not significant change in

effect was not significant (F(1,209) = 3.735; p = 0.0546). The
complexity of branching as a number of bifurcation differed
between the genotypes (F(1,209) = 20.57; p < 0.001). We
did not find a significant treatment effect (F(1,209) = 3.533;
p = 0.0616) but a significant genotype × treatment interaction
(F(1,209) = 17.64; p < 0.001) because LPS-induced a significant
reduction in the bifurcation in WT (−28.8%) but not in the
knockout mice (+16.4%; Figure 4C). Microglia branch order
was influenced by the genotype (F(1,209) = 11.62; p < 0.001)
but not by the treatment (F(1,209) = 1.616; p = 0.205). The
interaction between genotype and treatment was significant
(F(1,209) = 15.74; p < 0.001) because of the different reactivity
of microglia in WT (−38.5%) and GABA/CB1−/− mice (+6.8%;
Figure 4D).
The differences between the groups were even more
pronounced 24 h after the LPS injection. Branch length was
influenced by the genotype (F(1,224) = 31.57; p < 0.001),
treatment (F(1,224) = 21.43; p < 0.001) and there was an
interaction between the main factors (F(1,224) = 14.47; p < 0.001)
because microglia in GABA/CB1−/− mice were less reactive
to LPS-treatment (−23.1% in WTs and −4.5% in knockouts;
Figure 4A). The other marker of branch size, number of branches
showed a similar change: genotype effect: (F(1,224) = 23.08;
p < 0.001), treatment effect (F(1,224) = 17.48; p < 0.001) and
a genotype × treatment interaction (F(1,224) = 10.49; p < 0.01)
because of a reduced reactivity of microglia in GABA/CB1−/−
mice (−37.4% in WTs and −8.0% in knockouts; Figure 4B).
Complexity of branching shown as number of bifurcations was
lower in GABA/CB1−/− mice (F(1,224) = 23.39; p < 0.001)
and reduced after LPS treatment (F(1,224) = 17.69; p < 0.001),
but differently between the genotypes (genotype × treatment
interaction: F(1,224) = 10.53; p < 0.01). The reason of the
interaction was a reduced reactivity of microglia to LPS in the
hippocampi of GABA/CB1−/− mice (WTs: −37.6%; knockouts:
−8.2%; Figure 4C). The analysis of the other parameter of

branch complexity, branch order gave very similar results:
genotype effect: (F(1,224) = 31.57; p < 0.001), treatment effect
(F(1,224) = 21.43; p < 0.001) and a genotype × treatment
interaction (F(1,224) = 14.47; p < 0.001) due to a reduced
reactivity of microglia in GABA/CB1−/− mice (−60.0% in WTs
and −17.8% in knockouts; Figure 4D). All these morphological
changes were more pronounced in males than in females
(treatment × sex interaction—branch length: F(1,177) = 28.39;
p < 0.001; number of branches: F(1,177) = 28.69; p < 0.001;
number of bifurcations: F(1,177) = 28.22; p < 0.001; branch order:
F(1,177) = 15.89; p < 0.001).
The strong difference in microglia morphology between the
genotypes, treatment groups and reactivity of genotypes to
LPS was present also after repeated treatments in most of the
parameters. Branch length was reduced after the repeated LPS
injections (F(1,171) = 20.58; p < 0.001). We did not find a
significant genotype effect (F(1,171) = 1.409; p < 0.237) but again
microglia in GABA/CB1−/− mice showed a reduced reactivity
to LPS (genotype × treatment interaction: F(1,171) = 16.42;
p < 0.001; change in WT mice −34.5%, change in knockouts:
−2.5%; Figure 4A). The number of branches was influenced
by the genotype (F(1,171) = 10.63; p < 0.01), by the treatment
(F(1,171) = 23.55; p < 0.001) and by an interaction between
genotype and treatment (F(1,171) = 15.56; p < 0.001). The
reduction in microglial branch number due to the repeated LPS
injections was more intensive in the WT (−37.8%) than in
knockout mice (−5.7%; Figure 4B). The number of bifurcations
was less in the microglia in GABA/CB1−/− mice (F(1,171) = 10.64;

p < 0.01) and it was reduced after the LPS treatments
(F(1,171) = 25.08; p < 0.001). The reduction differed between the
genotypes (genotype × treatment interaction: F(1,171) = 15.83;
p < 0.001) because it was more intensive in WT (−38.6%) than
in knockout mice (−7.6%; Figure 4C). The analysis of branch
order, the alternative parameter of microglia branch complexity,
gave similar results: genotype effect: F(1,171) = 21.11; p < 0.001),
treatment effect: F(1,171) = 35.92; p < 0.001, genotype × treatment
interaction F(1,171) = 20.43; p < 0.001. Here again, the reduction
of branch order after LPS treatment was significant in the
microglia of WT mice (−61.2%) but not in the microglia of
GABA/CB1−/− mice (−18.3%; Figure 4D).
Microglial TNFα Levels
Enhanced microglia density and increased cell body are
interpreted as signs of microglial activation. Thus, we asked
whether the microglial level of the pro-inflammatory cytokine
TNFα correlates with the size of the microglia using saline-
treated mice from both genotypes. As shown in Figure 5A
the TNFα immunoreactivity was higher in the microglia cells
than in their surrounding cells or in their microenvironment.
Importantly, there was a significant correlation between size and
TNFα immunoreactivity of the microglia (r = 0.5209, p < 0.001;
Figure 5B) suggesting that higher cell bodies were associated
with enhanced pro-inflammatory activity. In good correlation
with our previous finding that microglia in GABA/CB1−/−
mice had increased size, the microglial TNFα levels were also
higher in GABA/CB1−/− mice than in their WT littermates
(Mann-Whitney U = 493; p < 0.001; Figure 5C).
Expression of Neuron-Glia Interaction
Proteins
We also tested the possibility that the altered microglia activity
in GABA/CB1−/− mice was due to an altered expression
of neuron-glia interaction proteins. Western blot analysis of
hippocampal protein lysates (Figure 6A) revealed that the
amount of the CX3CL1 was significantly reduced in the
conditional knockouts (t(16) = 2.399; p < 0.05; Figure 6B). The
expression of the other neuronal interaction proteins CD200
(t(10) = 1.403; p > 0.05), Sirpα (t(10) = 1.013; p > 0.05) or their
microglial receptors CD200R (t(10) = 0.304; p > 0.05), CX3CR1
(t(10) = 0.478; p > 0.05) and CD47 (t(10) = 0.525; p > 0.05)
did not differ between the genotypes (data not shown). Lastly,
we asked how lack of CB1 receptors on GABAergic neurons
influences the CX3CL1 expression on GABAergic neurons. For
that, using confocal microscopy, we determined the intensity of
CX3CL1 immunoreactivity in GAD67-positive cell bodies within
the hippocampus. As shown in Figure 6C was clearly co-localized
with GAD67 in WT mice. Importantly, GABAergic neurons in
the hippocampus of GABA/CB1−/− mice expressed significantly
less CX3CL1 than GABAergic neurons in WT mice (Mann-
Whitney U = 512; p < 0.05) and thus the co-localization was less
evident (Figure 6D).
DISCUSSION
It was hypothesized that cannabinoid signaling plays an
important role in the regulation of microglia cells (Luongo
et al., 2010), because cannabinoid receptor agonist could decrease

(Wolf et al., 2008) and antagonists increase (Lou et al., 2018)
pro-inflammatory microglial activity. Our present study now
suggests that cannabinoids can regulate microglial activity
indirectly, through CB1 receptors expressed on GABAergic
neurons, because genetic deletion of CB1 receptors from
GABAergic neurons led to a pro-inflammatory microglial
phenotype and altered reactivity to LPS in the hippocampus of
GABA/CB1−/− mice.
Generation and phenotypic analysis of constitutive (Ledent
et al., 1999; Zimmer et al., 1999) and conditional CB1 receptor
knockouts gave valuable information about the physiological
role of cannabinoid receptors. The GABA/CB1−/− mouse line
was generated almost 15 years ago on a C57BL/6N genetic
background (Monory et al., 2006). The conditional mutants are
healthy, breed normally and have a relatively mild phenotype:
They show hyperphagia (Bellocchio et al., 2010), recognition
deficits (Albayram et al., 2016) and altered fear coping (Lafenêtre
et al., 2009; Metna-Laurent et al., 2012). GABA/CB1−/− mice
have normal reactivity to acute stress (Steiner et al., 2008),
acute THC-treatment (Monory et al., 2007) and to excitotoxic
challenge (Chiarlone et al., 2014).
Microglia cells react to pro-inflammatory signals with
morphological and functional changes. Activated microglia have
an increased level of the ionic calcium binding adaptor molecule
1 (Iba1; Ito et al., 1998), enhanced cell body and they show an
elevated expression of inflammatory cytokines like IL-6, IL-1β
and TNF α (Hanisch and Kettenmann, 2007; Lynch, 2009).
In the absence of pro-inflammatory stimulus, microglia in
the hippocampus of GABA/CB1−/− mice had bigger cell bodies
and increased TNFα level than in control WTs. The density
of Iba1+ microglia was also higher in the hippocampus of
saline-treated GABA/CB1−/− mice, which may be the result of

increased microglia numbers or due to an elevated Iba1 level. All
these changes suggest an enhanced microglial pro-inflammatory
activity in the hippocampus of GABA/CB1−/− mice.
The
up-regulation
of
the
pro-inflammatory
cytokine
expression due to a massive pro-inflammatory stimulus by LPS
injection was quite similar between the genotypes: the amplitude
and dynamics of the cytokine expression was comparable
between WT and GABA/CB1−/− mice. The expression of the
inflammatory cytokines was lower after repeated rather than
after a single LPS injection in both genotypes suggesting a
development of tolerance against the pro-inflammatory stimulus
(Norden et al., 2016). However, the tolerance developed faster
in the conditional knockout line, because 24 h after the fourth
LPS injection the expression of each three cytokines remained
elevated in WT mice, whereas in the conditional knockouts the
TNFα expression did not differ between saline and LPS treated
mice. It is important to note that the expression of cytokines
was tested in the whole brain, whereas our histological analysis
focused on the hippocampus. The inflammatory response to
LPS can vary between brain regions, depending on the density
of microglia (Pintado et al., 2011). On the other hand, microglia
in the hippocampus showed similar morphological reactivity to
LPS as in the prefrontal cortex, striatum or cerebellum (Verdonk
et al., 2016).
Although
microglia
in
GABA/CB1−/−
mice
had
a
pro-inflammatory
morphology,
they
showed
a
reduced
morphological
reactivity
to
LPS
challenge.
Microglia
sizes increased 3 h after the injection in WT but not in
GABA/CB1−/− mice. 24 h after the LPS-treatment microglia
in the GABA/CB1−/− mice were significantly bigger than
microglia in LPS-injected WT mice. Repeated LPS injection
elicited a similar change in both genotypes. Microglia branching
strongly differed between WT and GABA/CB1−/−
mice,
as microglia branches in the hippocampus of knockout
mice
showed
reduced
size
and
complexity—typical
for
activated
microglia.
Interestingly,
LPS-injection
failed
to
induce any further change in branch morphology in the
knockout mice. It is possible that the reason of the reduced
microglial reactivity to LPS challenge is a ceiling effect. LPS
could induce a significant reduction in microglial processes
and concomitant increase in cell body size in WT mice,
but
not
in
the
constitutive
knockouts
where
microglia
without LPS treatment already showed a pro-inflammatory
morphology.
Furthermore, our results suggest that microglia morphology
and cytokine expression are regulated independently from each
other, in which is in accordance with previous publications
(Cunningham et al., 2005; Norden et al., 2016).

Cannabinoid Signaling Influences Microglial Activity
Sex of the mice had a complex effect on LPS-induced increase
in microglia activity assessed 24 h after a single injection: it did
not influence cytokine production, whereas microglia density
was higher in LPS-treated males than in females independent
from the genotype. The increase in microglia size due to LPS
treatment was generally more intensive in females than in males
after LPS treatment in GABA/CB1−/− mice. However, the sex
of the mice did not influence the intensity of microglial size
change in LPS-treated WT mice. When we compared the effect
of LPS on microglia branching between the sexes we observed
an opposite picture: reduction in branch size and complexity was
more intensive in males rather than in females.
It is known that neurons control microglia activity by
expressing surface proteins, which bind and activate their
receptors expressed on microglia cells (Hoek et al., 2000;
Cardona et al., 2006; Bessis et al., 2007). Besides these directly
interacting neuron-glia ligand receptor pairs neurons detect
glial activity by expressing cytokine receptors (Arisi, 2014;
Crews and Vetreno, 2016) and microglia senses neuronal
activity by expressing neurotransmitter receptors (Liu et al.,
2016). Our study now extends the original hypothesis about
the role of cannabinoid system in neuron–glia communication
(Luongo et al., 2010) by showing the crucial role of GABAergic
neurons in it. The cannabinoid signaling as a communication
channel is probably most important between GABAergic
neurons and microglia cells in the hippocampus because
GABAergic neurons express cannabinoid receptors (CB1)
on the highest level in this brain area (Marsicano and Lutz,
1999). The 2-AG production of microglia is high (Witting
et al., 2004), while they express cannabinoid receptors at a
very low level in the healthy brain (Stella, 2010). Deletion
of CB1 receptors from GABAergic neurons disrupts the
cannabinoid-mediated communication and through the lack
of the necessary feedback from the microglia, GABAergic
neurons could lose their inhibitory control. Indeed, reduced
expression of CX3CL one is a sign of a diminished control and
may be responsible for the pro-inflammatory phenotype
of
microglia
in
GABA/CB1−/−
mice
(Cardona
et
al.,
2006).
In a previous study, we found an increased density of activated
microglia
and
enhanced
expression
of
pro-inflammatory
cytokines in 12-month-old GABA/CB1−/− mice (Albayram
et al., 2011). We had two alternative hypotheses for this
phenomenon:
We
assumed
that
lack
of
CB1
receptors
on GABAergic neurons exacerbates brain aging and, as
a
consequence
leads
to
an
increased
microglia
activity.
Alternatively, it is possible that CB1 receptor signaling on
GABAergic neurons has a specific role in the regulation of
microglia activity, thus genetic deletion of CB1 from GABAergic
neurons impairs neuronal control leading to accelerated brain
aging. Our present results with young, 3-month-old mice
support the second hypothesis and suggest that GABAergic
neurons have a specific role in the regulation of microglia cells
and cannabinoid signaling plays an important role in it.
