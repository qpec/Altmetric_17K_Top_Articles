Obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes are associated with cancer-related mortality. We assessed whether hyperin-
sulinemia is a risk factor for cancer death in nonobese people without diabetes. We conducted a prospective cohort study
using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999–2010 and followed up the participants until
December 31, 2011. For the primary analysis of cancer mortality, we used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate hazard
ratios (HRs) in the participants with hyperinsulinemia and those without. Hyperinsulinemia was defined as a fasting insulin
level of �10 lU/mL. To identify causes of deaths, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes were used.
This study included 9,778 participants aged 20 years or older without diabetes or a history of cancer: 6,718 nonobese partici-
pants (2,057 with hyperinsulinemia [30.6%]) and 3,060 obese participants (2,303 with hyperinsulinemia [75.3%]). A total of
99.9% completed follow-up. Among all study participants, cancer mortality was significantly higher in those with hyperinsuli-
nemia than in those without hyperinsulinemia (adjusted HR 2.04, 95% CI 1.24–3.34, p 5 0.005). Similarly, among nonobese
participants, multivariable analysis showed that cancer mortality was significantly higher in those with hyperinsulinemia than
in those without (adjusted HR 1.89, 95% CI 1.07–3.35, p 5 0.02). Considering that nonobese people with hyperinsulinemia
were at higher risk of cancer mortality than those without hyperinsulinemia, improvement of hyperinsulinemia may be an
important approach for preventing cancer regardless of the presence or absence of obesity.
The global prevalence of obesity has increased markedly over
the past three decades, and its incidence continues to acceler-
ate.1,2 Overweight and obesity were estimated to cause 3.4
million deaths in 2010.3 Excess weight is an important risk
factor not only for cardiovascular diseases but also for can-
cer.4

ological mechanisms remain unclear, many obesity-related
factors such as hyperinsulinemia and inflammation may
increase cancer risk via their influences on neoplastic pro-
cesses.7,8 However, hyperinsulinemia also occurs in nonobese

 people. In fact, apart from obesity, race/ethnicity, sex, physi-
cal activity, and genetic factors are important contributors to
insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia.9,10 Hyperinsulinemia
may promote cancer independent of obesity as insulin can
exert its oncogenic potential via abnormal stimulation of
multiple cellular signaling cascades;11 however, no study has
investigated whether hyperinsulinemia in nonobese people
without diabetes is similarly associated with increased risks of
cancer and cancer-related death. Therefore, using nationally
representative data, we assessed whether hyperinsulinemia
was a risk factor for cancer death in nonobese people without
diabetes. In addition, a previous study suggested that elevated
fasting glucose levels are an independent risk factor of cancer
death.12 We assessed whether higher glucose levels were asso-
ciated with an increased risk of cancer death in people with-
out diabetes.
Material and Methods
Data source and study population
This was a prospective cohort study using data from the con-
tinuous National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) 1999–2010.13 The NHANES is a cross-sectional
survey with linked follow-up data. The cross-sectional survey
is conducted every 2 years by the National Center for Health
Statistics (NCHS) at the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention in the US. It uses a stratified, multistage probability
sampling design, which enables representation of the US
civilian noninstitutionalized population.13 In this study, data
were collected at people’s homes and at mobile examination
centers (MECs). Blood specimens were collected during the
MEC examinations. Written informed consent was obtained
from all participants. The NCHS Research Ethics Review
Board approved the NHANES protocols.14
Among the population participating in the NHANES dur-
ing 1999–2010, the unweighted response rate of household
interviews was 80.6% and that of MEC examinations was
77.1%.15 We focused on fasting insulin levels in participants
aged 20 years or older without diabetes or a history of can-
cer. Diabetes was defined as meeting one of the following
four criteria: a previous diagnosis of diabetes, intake of anti-
diabetic medication or insulin, a fasting glucose level of
�126 mg/dl or a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of
�6.5%.16 History of cancer was defined as a previous diagno-
sis of cancer/malignancy. Among a total of 10,033 partici-
pants aged 20 years or older without diabetes or a history of
cancer, we excluded those with missing information on
body-mass index (BMI, calculated as weight [kg] divided by
height [m] squared), race/ethnicity, educational attainment,
smoking status, hypertension, dyslipidemia, history of cardio-
vascular disease or fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level. This
produced a final sample of 9,778. We prospectively followed
up these study participants from the date of survey participa-
tion for interviews until December 31, 2011.
Definition of hyperinsulinemia and cancer mortality
Information on fasting insulin levels was extracted from the
MEC measurements in the NHANES 1999–2010. Fasting
insulin levels were tested after participants had fasted for at
least 9 hrs. Serum insulin was analyzed using the Pharmacia
RIA assay in the NHANES 1999–2002, the Tosoh immu-
noenzymometric assay in the NHANES 2003–2004, the Mer-
codia ELISA assay in the NHANES 2005–2009 and the
Roche chemiluminescent immunoassay in the NHANES
2009–2010. Median fasting insulin levels were 9.8, 9.3, 7.3,
8.4, 9.2 and 10.6 lU/mL in the NHANES 1999–2000, 2001–
2002, 2003–2004, 2005–2006, 2007–2008 and 2009–2010,
respectively, and 9.2 lU/mL in all study participants. Based
on these data, hyperinsulinemia was defined as a fasting
insulin level of �10 lU/mL. The conversion factor for
insulin is 1 lU/mL 5 6.00 pmol/L. This unit conversion is
based on the World Health Organization (WHO) standard
adopted in 1987 based on human insulin with a potency of
26,000 U/g.17,18
The primary endpoint was cancer mortality. We used the
mortality follow-up data that were provided in the Public-use
Linked Mortality Files.19 To identify causes of deaths occur-
ring in participants in or after 1999, the NHANES used the
International
Classification
of
Diseases,
Tenth
Revision
codes.20 The specific code was C00–C97 for causes of death
from malignant neoplasms.
Other measurements
We extracted data on potential confounders, including age,
sex, race and ethnicity, education attainment, smoking status,
BMI, hypertension, dyslipidemia, history of cardiovascular
disease and FPG level measured upon MEC examination. We
categorized age into four groups: 20–39 years, 40–59 years,
60–79 years and �80 years. Race and ethnicity were classified
as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican Ameri-
can or “Others” including other Hispanics, Asian and multi-
racial participants. We classified educational attainment as
beyond high school, high school graduation or general
What’s new?
Obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes are associated with cancer-related mortality, with hyperinsulinemia possibly
playing a role. However, hyperinsulinemia also occurs in nonobese people. So far, no study has investigated whether hyperinsu-
linemia in nonobese people without diabetes is associated with increased risks of cancer-related death. This prospective cohort
study shows that among nonobese people, hyperinsulinemia was associated with a significantly higher risk of cancer mortality.
Furthermore, hyperinsulinemia was associated with an increased risk of cancer death in people with normal fasting plasma glu-
cose levels. Improvement of hyperinsulinemia may thus be an important approach for preventing cancer regardless of obesity.

Smoking status was classified as current, former, or never
smoker. Obesity was defined as a BMI of �30 kg/m2 and
nonobesity was defined as a BMI of <30 kg/m2. In all study
participants, BMI was classified as <18.5, 18.5–24.9, 25.0–
29.9, 30.0–34.9 or �35.0 kg/m2. BMI in obese participants
was classified as 30.0–34.9 or �35.0 kg/m2 and that in
nonobese participants was classified as <18.5, 18.5–24.9 or
25.0–29.9 kg/m2. Hypertension was defined as either a previ-
ous diagnosis of hypertension or intake of anti-hypertensive
medication. Dyslipidemia was defined as a previous diagnosis
of hypercholesterolemia, intake of lipid-lowering medication,
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol �140 mg/dl, high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol <40 mg/dl or triglycerides �200 mg/
dl. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was calculated using
the Friedewald equation (total cholesterol 2 high-density lipo-
protein cholesterol 2 triglycerides/5) for participants exam-
ined in the morning in the fasting state who had triglyceride
levels �400 mg/dl (triglycerides were converted to millimoles
per liter by multiplying by 0.0113). History of cardiovascular

 disease was defined as a previous diagnosis of coronary heart
disease, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, or stroke.
FPG levels were tested in participants who had fasted for at
least 9 hrs.
Statistical analysis
Demographic data are presented as numbers with propor-
tions (%) or means with standard deviations (SD). Study par-
ticipants with hyperinsulinemia were compared with those
without hyperinsulinemia using a t test for continuous varia-
bles or the v2 test for categorical variables. For the primary
analyses of cancer mortality outcome, we used Cox propor-
tional hazard models to analyze the unadjusted and adjusted
hazard ratios (HRs) in participants with hyperinsulinemia
compared with those without hyperinsulinemia. Kaplan–
Meier survival curves were constructed for cancer mortality
outcomes in participants with and without hyperinsulinemia.
In the first multivariable model (model 1), we included age,
sex, race/ethnicity, education attainment, smoking status and
BMI for adjustment. In the second multivariable model
(model 2), hypertension, dyslipidemia, history of cardiovascu-
lar disease and FPG (continuous) were added to the factors
in model 1 for adjustment. Because of the possibility of mul-
ticollinearity between FPG and hyperinsulinemia, we con-
ducted additional analyses in the model 2 excluding FPG.
The analyses were performed for nonobese and obese partici-
pants. To explore the effect modification on hyperinsulinemia
and cancer mortality by obesity status, we tested for interac-
tions between hyperinsulinemia and obesity in the multivari-
able model 2. Among nonobese participants, the analyses
were also performed in participants with normal weight
(BMI: 18.5–25.0 kg/m2) and with overweight (BMI: 25.0–
29.9 kg/m2). Participants with a BMI of <18.5 kg/m2 may
have a preexisting illness and represent some reverse causa-
tion; thus, we conducted sensitivity analyses excluding these
participants. In addition, the effects of central adiposity may
not have been fully adjusted even in the multivariable model
2 that includes the detailed classification of BMI; thus, we
conducted further analyses with adjustment for waist circum-
ference in addition to the potential confounders of models 1
and 2. Furthermore, we conducted similar analyses with all
study participants divided into two groups according to a
cut-off FPG level of 100 mg/dl, which approximated the
overall mean value in this study. To exclude the potential
effect of the complication of undiagnosed cancer, we con-
ducted sensitivity analyses limited to the cancer mortality
outcome with a follow-up period of �1 year. Although the
NHANES measured physical activity, this variable was not
included in the main analyses owing to inconsistent measure-
ments, which changed between the 20052006 and 2007–2008
periods. Therefore, as another sensitivity analysis limited to
the data from NHANES 1999–2006, physical activity was
added as an adjustment to model 2. Physical activity was
divided into two groups according to a cutoff value of 150
min per week of walking and/or bicycling.21
All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata software
(version 14.1, Stata Corp, College Station, Texas, USA),
accounting for the complex survey design. We used an
appropriate weight for each analysis, based on the variables
selected. These weights accounted for unequal probabilities of
selection and nonresponses to make unbiased national esti-
mates. P values of <0.05 were considered statistically signifi-
cant.
Given
the
lack
of
statistical
power
inherent
in
interaction tests, we used a p values cut point of <0.2 for
such tests.22

The
study
included 6,718 nonobese participants (2,057 with hyperinsuli-
nemia [30.6%]) and 3,060 obese participants (2,303 with
hyperinsulinemia [75.3%]). Among nonobese participants,
hyperinsulinemia was associated with more proportion of
male sex, race/ethnicity of Mexican-American or Others, edu-
cation attainment of less than high school, and former smok-
ing,
higher
BMI,
more
prevalence
of
hypertension,
dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease, and higher FPG lev-
els. Among obese participants, hyperinsulinemia was associ-
ated with more proportion of male sex, and Mexican-
American, higher BMI, more prevalence of hypertension and
dyslipidemia, and higher FPG levels.
Kaplan–Meier survival curves and event rates for cancer
death of all study participants with and without hyperinsuli-
nemia are shown in Figure 1 and Table 2, respectively. The
mean (6SD) follow-up period in all study participants was
6.7 (62.9) years. A total of 99.9% completed follow-up and a
total of 144 cancer deaths were reported. The event rates for
cancer death in participants with and without hyperinsuline-
mia were 2.2 and 1.1 per 1,000 person–years, respectively,
and unadjusted and age- and sex-adjusted HRs (95% confi-
dence intervals [CI]) for cancer death were significantly
higher in participants with hyperinsulinemia than in those

 without hyperinsulinemia (unadjusted HR 1.93, 95% CI 1.23–
3.01, p 5 0.004; age- and sex-adjusted HR 1.82, 95% CI 1.16–
2.83, p 5 0.009). Using multivariable Cox proportional hazard
models, cancer mortality was significantly higher in the par-
ticipants with hyperinsulinemia than in those without (model
1: HR 2.04, 95% CI 1.27–3.28, p 5 0.004; model 2: HR 2.04,
95% CI 1.24–3.34, p 5 0.005). Similar results were observed
in the model 2 when FPG was excluded (HR 2.10, 95% CI
1.29–3.44, p 5 0.003). The analyses including waist circumfer-
ence did not change the results (model 1 with waist circum-
ference: HR 1.98, 95% CI 1.19–3.30, p 5 0.009; model 2 with
waist circumference: HR 1.97, 95% CI 1.17–3.34, p 5 0.01).
Similarly, cancer mortality in men was significantly higher in
those with hyperinsulinemia than in those without hyperin-
sulinemia (model 1: HR 2.08, 95% CI 1.22–3.56, p 5 0.008;
model 2: HR 2.15, 95% CI 1.26–3.70, p 5 0.006). Among
female participants, cancer mortality was not significantly
higher in those with hyperinsulinemia than in those without
(model 1: HR 1.91, 95% CI 0.79–4.68, p 5 0.15; model 2: HR
1.78, 95% CI 0.67–4.72, p 5 0.24). Furthermore, to assess
whether the results differed between assays, we conducted
sensitivity analyses stratified by the survey years: 1999–2002
for the Pharmacia RIA assay, 2003–2004 for the Tosoh
immunoenzymometric assay, 2005–2008 for the Mercodia
ELISA assay and 2009–2010 for the Roche chemiluminescent
immunoassay. Compared with those without hyperinsuline-
mia, the adjusted HRs in the multivariable model 2 in those
with hyperinsulinemia varied (1999–2002: HR 1.40, 95% CI
0.75–2.58; 2003–2004: HR 1.93, 95% CI 0.60–6.21; 2005–
2008: HR 6.53, 95% CI 3.04–14.02; 2009–2010: HR 2.26, 95%
CI 0.39–13.09).
In nonobese participants, cancer mortality was signifi-
cantly higher in those with hyperinsulinemia than in those
without hyperinsulinemia (unadjusted HR 2.10, 95% CI 1.23–
3.58, p 5 0.007) (Fig. 2a). In obese participants, cancer mor-
tality was higher in those with hyperinsulinemia but there
was no significant association between those with and with-
out hyperinsulinemia (unadjusted HR 2.31, 95% CI 0.61–
8.72, p 5 0.21) (Fig. 2b). Although there was no significant
association, similar results were observed in participants with
overweight and those with normal weight (overweight partici-
pants: unadjusted HR 1.83, 95% CI 0.95–3.55, p 5 0.07; nor-
mal weight participants: unadjusted HR 1.88, 95% CI 0.60–
5.90, p 5 0.27) (Supporting Information Fig. 1). Among non-
obese participants, multivariable Cox proportional hazard
analysis showed that cancer mortality was significantly higher
in those with hyperinsulinemia than in those without (model
1: HR 1.96, 95% CI 1.12–3.45, p 5 0.01; model 2: HR 1.89,
95% CI 1.07–3.35, p 5 0.02). The analysis in the model 2
excluding FPG showed similar results (HR 2.04, 95% CI
1.14–3.63, p 5 0.01). In addition, the analysis in the multivar-
iable model 2 showed that older age, male sex, and current
smoking were also significantly associated with an increased
risk of cancer death in nonobese participants. The sensitivity
analyses excluding participants with a BMI of <18.5 kg/m2
showed similar results (model 1: HR 1.87, 95% CI 1.07–3.27,
p 5 0.02; model 2: HR 1.83, 95% CI 1.04–3.22, p 5 0.03). In
addition, similar results were observed after multivariable
adjustment including waist circumference (model 1 with
waist circumference: HR 1.91, 95% CI 1.02–3.56, p 5 0.04;
model 2 with waist circumference: HR 1.83, 95% CI 0.97–
3.45, p 5 0.06). The HRs for cancer mortality in nonobese
participants limited to the maximum follow-up periods of 1,
3 and 5 years were as follows: 1 year (model 1: HR 0.70, 95%
CI 0.10–5.00, p 5 0.72; model 2: HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.07–3.35,
p 5 0.45), 3 year (model 1: HR 2.14, 95% CI 0.80–5.70,
p 5 0.12; model 2: HR 1.92, 95% CI 0.66–5.65, p 5 0.23) and
5 year (model 1: HR 1.71, 95% CI 0.76–3.86, p 5 0.19; model
2: HR 1.58, 95% CI 0.66–3.77, p 5 0.29). Although there were
limited powers, cancer mortality in obese participants was
not significantly higher in those with hyperinsulinemia than
in those without (model 1: HR 2.38, 95% CI 0.67–8.38,
p 5 0.17; model 2: HR 2.59, 95% CI 0.68–9.86, p 5 0.16). The
results did not change in the analysis in the model 2 when
FPG was excluded (HR 2.46, 95% CI 0.67–8.99, p 5 0.17).
The analysis in the multivariable model 2 showed that other

 baseline characteristics were also not significantly associated
with cancer death in obese participants. In the model that
included the interaction term between hyperinsulinemia and
obesity, we found that the association between hyperinsuline-
mia and cancer mortality was significantly interacted by obe-
sity status (P for interaction term 5 0.12). Risk for cancer
mortality in participants with and without hyperinsulinemia
after multivariable adjustment including physical activity is
presented in Supporting Information Table 1. Similar HRs
for cancer mortality in nonobese participants were observed
after multivariable adjustment including physical activity
(adjusted HR 1.98, 95% CI 1.06–3.67, p 5 0.03). Furthermore,
additional sensitivity analyses in nonobese participants lim-
ited to the cancer mortality outcome with a follow-up period
of at least 1 year showed almost the same results (model 1:
HR 1.99, 95% CI 1.12–3.52, p 5 0.01; model 2: HR 1.95, 95%
CI 1.09–3.48, p 5 0.02) (Table 3). Further analyses in the
multivariable model 2 limited to nonobese men, obese men,
nonobese women, and obese women were conducted. The
HRs for cancer mortality in participants with hyperinsuline-
mia compared with those without were as follows: HR in
nonobese men 1.80, 95% CI 0.96–3.35, p 5 0.06; HR in obese
men 8.04, 95% CI 0.86–75.52, p 5 0.06: HR in nonobese
women 2.30, 95% CI 0.76–6.98, p 5 0.14; HR in obese
women 0.97, 95% CI 0.25–3.79, p 5 0.96). Although there
were limited powers, the HR for cancer mortality was lower
in obese women than in the others.
Kaplan–Meier survival curves and event rates for cancer
deaths in participants with FPG levels of �100 mg/dl and
<100 mg/dl are shown in Supporting Information Figure 2 and
Table 4, respectively. The cumulative event rates of cancer death
in participants with FPG �100 mg/dl were significantly higher
in those with hyperinsulinemia than in those without (model 1:
HR 2.06, 95% CI 1.12–3.44, p5 0.02; model 2: HR 2.05, 95%
CI 1.12–3.76, p5 0.02). In addition, among the participants
with FPG levels <100 mg/dl, cancer mortality was higher in
those with hyperinsulinemia but not significantly different
between those with and without hyperinsulinemia (model 1:
HR 1.92, 95% CI 0.89–4.10, p5 0.09; model 2: HR 1�96, 95%
CI 0.90–4.25, p5 0.08). The multivariable adjustments including
physical activity did not substantially change these results.
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospective
cohort study using nationally representative data to investi-
gate the association between hyperinsulinemia and cancer
mortality in nonobese people. Among nonobese people,
hyperinsulinemia was associated with a significantly higher
risk of cancer mortality. Furthermore, hyperinsulinemia was
also associated with an increased risk of cancer death in peo-
ple with normal FPG levels.
Insulin resistance is common in people with obesity, metabolic
syndrome, and type 2 diabetes; conditions in which hyperinsuline-
mia is frequently observed. Although these disorders are well

 known as risk factors for cardiovascular disease, recent studies
have reported that these conditions are also associated with cancer
and cancer-related mortality.23–28 Although the reasons for this
association are unclear, hyperinsulinemia may have an important
role in tumor initiation and progression.11,24–29 Hyperinsulinemia
may lead to higher risks of cancer development through not only
direct mitogenic effects but also through the indirect effect of
increased circulating levels of bioavailable insulin-like growth fac-
tor 1 (IGF-1).5,30 IGF-1 has mitogenic and antiapoptotic effects,
which can promote cancer proliferation,31 and some studies have
suggested that higher levels of IGF-1 may be associated with an
increased risk of cancer and cancer mortality.30,32 Almost all stud-
ies on the association between hyperinsulinemia and cancer have
included many obese people and diabetes patients.24–29 Obesity
can lead to adipokine abnormalities, which affect various stages of
obesity-induced carcinogenesis.33 In addition, eating too much of a
diet containing carcinogenic compounds may be a risk factor for
cancer.34,35 Moreover, obesity may cause inflammatory responses
such as induction of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 6,
leading to promotion of cancer progression.36 Furthermore, obe-
sity can also result in inferior treatment outcomes and poorer
responses to treatment.37 Thus, obesity is related to many unfavor-
able factors which cannot be fully statistically adjusted. Similarly,
insulin levels in diabetes patients are strongly associated with dura-
tion of diabetes and use of antidiabetic medicines. Therefore, we
needed to exclude the influence of obesity and diabetes to assess
the association between hyperinsulinemia and cancer mortality.
Insulin resistance is a heterogeneous disorder that is different in
each individual, for which environmental and genetic factors deter-
mine susceptibility in varying proportions.10,11 Therefore, hyperin-
sulinemia occurs not only in obese people. In the present study,
about 30% of nonobese people had hyperinsulinemia. Hyperinsuli-
nemia, regardless of the presence or absence of obesity, may pre-
dict a high risk of cancer death. Hyperinsulinemia, regardless of
the presence or absence of obesity, may predict a high risk of can-
cer death. Although hyperinsulinemia in obese women may not be
associated with increased risk of cancer death, more large scale
studies are required to confirm the results.
A previous study suggested that an increased FPG level
might be an independent risk factor for several major cancers,12
and hyperglycemia has been shown to confer resistance to che-
motherapy in breast cancer.38 A possible explanation is that
hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress leads to cancer progres-
sion.39 Although hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia frequently
coexist, this study showed that hyperinsulinemia in people with
normal FPG levels might be associated with an increased risk of
cancer mortality. Further studies are needed to investigate the
underlying reasons for these findings.
This study has several limitations. First, there are inherent
limitations associated with an observational study design,
including possible residual confounding effects from unmea-
sured covariates. Particularly, the effects of central adiposity
may not be fully adjusted even with multiple analyses including
BMI and waist circumference. Second, this was a short-term
follow-up study. In addition, because the nonobese participants
without diabetes or a history of cancer had low mortality risks,
the relatively small number of events may have influenced the
results. Although various analyses indicate the findings in this
study were robust, a longer-term and larger-scale study is
needed to confirm the results. Third, the HRs for cancer death
in participants with hyperinsulinemia varied among assays for
insulin measurement. Further studies are needed to clarify the
association between the risk of cancer death and fasting insulin
levels measured by standardized assays. Fourth, the outcome of
the present study was cancer mortality, but cancer development
was not assessed. Therefore, we could not tell whether the can-
cer mortality in nonobese people with hyperinsulinemia was
attributable to cancer development or accelerated growth of
cancer after development. Moreover, the types of cancer were
not known. To reveal the pathophysiological relationship
between hyperinsulinemia and cancer death, further studies are
required. However, our findings may have a significant impact
on the prevention of serious and advanced cancers, leading to
decreased risks of cancer death.
In conclusion, this study showed that nonobese people with
hyperinsulinemia had a higher risk of cancer mortality. Even if
people are not obese, improvement of hyperinsulinemia by
increased physical activity and avoidance of a sedentary life-
style may be an important approach for preventing cancer.
