 Abstract
OBJECTIVE—To estimate the proportion of visits to United States emergency departments 
(EDs) receiving a diagnosis of elder abuse using two nationally representative datasets.
DESIGN—Retrospective cross-sectional analysis.
SETTING—U.S. ED visits recorded in either the 2012 Nationwide Emergency Department 
Sample (NEDS), or the 2011 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS).
PARTICIPANTS—All ED visits by patients aged 60 years and older.
MEASUREMENTS—The primary outcome was elder abuse as defined by ICD-9-CM diagnosis 
codes. The proportion of visits with elder abuse was estimated using survey weights. Odds ratios 
(OR) were calculated to identify patient demographics and common ED diagnoses associated with 
elder abuse.
RESULTS—In 2012, NEDS contained 6,723,667 ED visits by older adults, representing an 
estimated 29,056,673 ED visits. Elder abuse was diagnosed in an estimated 3,846 visits, 
corresponding to a weighted diagnosis period prevalence of elder abuse in U.S. EDs of 0.013% 
(95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.012– 0.015%). Neglect and physical abuse were the most 
common types diagnosed, accounting for 32.9% and 32.2% of cases, respectively. Multivariable 
analysis showed increased weighted odds of elder abuse diagnosis in females (OR 1.95, 95% CI 
1.68–2.26), and patients with contusion (OR 2.91, 95% CI 2.36–3.57), urinary tract infection (OR 
2.21, 95% CI 1.84–2.65), or septicemia (OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.44–2.55). In the 2011 NHAMCS 
dataset, zero cases of elder abuse were recorded among the 5,965 older adult ED visits.
CONCLUSION—Among US ED visits by older adults, the proportion of visits receiving a 
diagnosis of elder abuse is at least two orders of magnitude lower than the estimated prevalence in 
the population. Efforts to improve the identification of elder abuse in EDs may be warranted.

INTRODUCTION
Elder abuse is an under-recognized and under-reported public health issue which places 
victims at increased risk for disability and death1–3 and increased use of health care 
resources.4,5 Although difficult to estimate,6,7 elder abuse is estimated to cost billions of 
dollars annually.8 Estimates of the prevalence of elder abuse among community-dwelling 
older adults range from 5–10%.9–11 Elder abuse can be classified into five types that may 
occur concurrently: physical, psychological/verbal, sexual, neglect, and financial 
exploitation.12 Described risk factors for elder abuse include female, younger age (among 
older adults), living with multiple household members other than a spouse, lack of social 
support, low income, poor physical health, and functional impairment.9
Emergency departments (EDs) have been shown to be important sites for identifying other 
types of abuse including intimate partner violence13 and child abuse,14,15 and similar to 
other forms of abuse, elder abuse may result in injuries or illness prompting emergency

 evaluation.16 For these reasons and because of the increasing use of EDs by older adults,17 
EDs are a potentially important setting for identifying elder abuse.18,19 In two Virginia EDs, 
Eulitt et al. observed that 46% of elderly patients had functional difficulties which might 
place them at increased risk for elder abuse.19 In a single ED in North Carolina, Stevens et 
al. observed that 7% of older adults reported experiencing physical or psychological abuse in 
the past year.10 However, little is known about how often elder abuse is diagnosed in EDs, or 
the characteristics of patients that are diagnosed in EDs. A better understanding of current 
practice patterns regarding the diagnosis of elder abuse in US EDs is needed to inform 
efforts to improve identification of this common and costly problem.
The objective of this study is to estimate the frequency of elder abuse diagnosis in US EDs 
and to describe the characteristics of these patients.
METHODS
Study Design and Setting
This was a retrospective cross-sectional study using two nationally representative databases 
and was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of North Carolina at 
Chapel Hill. Analyses used the 2012 Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) 
and the 2011 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS), the most 
recent years available for each dataset. A similar study design using NEDS was used to 
report on the frequency of identification of intimate partner violence in US EDs.20
The NEDS is an annual dataset compiled by the Agency for Healthcare Research and 
Quality (AHRQ) using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project’s (HCUP) Databases. 
NEDS includes approximately 20% of all US ED visits and, in using a weighted sampling 
methodology, allows for calculation of national and regional estimates. A complete 
description of NEDS is available on the HCUP website.21
The NHAMCS is an annual survey administered by the U.S. Census Bureau using a four-
stage probability sampling design to characterize U.S. ED care at non-institutional general 
and short-stay hospitals. The 2011 NHAMCS data inlcudes a representative sample of 322 
EDs over four-week reporting periods. Similar to NEDS, NHAMCS provides sample 
weights that can be used to obtain national estimates. A complete description of NHAMCS 
is available from the National Center for Health Statistics.22
Case Definition
A common legal definition of elder abuse is actions or neglect against a vulnerable or 
dependent older adult committed by someone serving as a caregiver.23 The primary outcome 
of elder abuse was defined as an ED visits by an adult aged 60 years and older with one of 
the following International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification 
(ICD9-CM) diagnosis codes: Adult Maltreatment, unspecified (995.80); Physical abuse 
(995.81); Emotional/Psychological Abuse (995.82); Sexual Abuse (995.83); Neglect 
(nutritional) (995.84); and Other Forms of Abuse and Neglect (995.85). Age 60 was chosen 
as the minimum age for eligible cases as it is used for elder abuse laws in many states, it

 defines eligibility for services under the Older Americas Act,24 and allows for comparisons 
with prior studies.25,26
A broader definition of elder abuse has also been described to include any form of physical, 
sexual, or psychological abuse, or neglect, abandonment, financial exploitation of an older 
person independent of setting or relationship between offender and victim.8 Recognizing 
that distinguishing between elder abuse and other forms of intimate partner violence 
experienced by older adults may be difficult, we also considered additional diagnosis codes 
as a broader definition of elder abuse27 as listed in Table 1.
Measures
Visit characteristics examined included patient age, gender, income quartile, Charlson 
comorbidity index (0, 1–2, 2–3, and ≥3),28 disposition, and among those admitted, inpatient 
length of stay in days. Commonly occurring ED diagnoses were characterized using the 
Clinical Classification Software (CCS) tool developed by HCUP.29 The CCS tool groups 
individual ICD-9 diagnoses codes into clinically similar entities, which allows for analysis 
of broad categories of diagnoses and avoids the problem of model overfitting. The ten most 
common primary CCS diagnoses were selected using the HCUPNet Data Tool among all ED 
patients 65–85 years old.30 Only using CCS diagnosis groups ensures at least ten events per 
covariate in multivariable analysis.31 Hospital region and hospital teaching status were also 
examined.
Data Analysis
All analyses used the observation weights, strata, and primary sampling units provided in 
each dataset to calculate weighted estimates. Population totals, weighted proportions, and 
weighted 95% confidence intervals were determined using Stata command svy: total and 
svy: proportion, respectively. For continuous variables, weighted means and 95% confidence 
intervals were reported using svy: mean. A logistic regression model was employed using 
the svy: logistic command to calculate weighted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals 
for potential predictors of elder abuse. Covariates included in the model were patient gender, 
age, Charlson comorbidity index, presence or absence of the ten most common ED 
diagnoses, hospital teaching status, and hospital region. Statistical significance was set at 
p<0.05.
Analysis of NEDs data was performed using STATA version 14 (StataCorp., College Station, 
TX). Analysis of NAHMCS used SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).
RESULTS
The 2012 NEDS contained 6,723,667 patient visits by adults aged 60 years and older, 
representing an estimated 29,056,673 ED visits nationally (Table 1). Using survey weights, 
an estimated 3,846 cases (95% CI 3,434–4,258) of elder abuse were diagnosed, 
corresponding to a weighted period prevalence of 0.013% (95% CI 0.012–0.015%). Among 
visits with at least one of these diagnoses, 3% were diagnosed with two types of elder abuse 
and 0.1% were diagnosed with three types of elder abuse. When the broader definition of 
elder abuse was used there were 7,154 weighted cases diagnosed, corresponding to a

 weighted period prevalence of 0.025% (95% CI 0.021–0.028). When stratified by region, the 
Northeast had the lowest prevalence (0.011%, 95% CI 0.008– 0.014%), while the Western 
region had the highest prevalence (0.016%, 95% CI 0.012–0.020%). Among patients 
diagnosed with elder abuse, neglect and physical abuse were the most common (32.9% and 
32.2%, respectively).
Table 2 lists weighted patient demographics and hospital characteristics among all ED visits 
by older adults, and among visits by patients who were diagnosed with elder abuse. Overall, 
the mean age of patients was 74.0 years (95% CI 73.9–74.2). Those diagnosed with elder 
abuse had similar mean age and distribution of comorbidity scores compared to all ED 
patients 60 years and older. Visits diagnosed with elder abuse were disproportionately by 
females (73.7% vs. 57.4% female for all visits), and patients in the lowest income quartile 
(36.8% vs. 29.4%). Additionally, visits in which elder abuse was diagnosed were 
disproportionately by patients with contusion/superficial injury (15.3% vs. 6.4% of all 
visits), urinary tract infection (22% vs. 10.2%), and septicemia (7.5% vs. 3.3%). Patients 
with elder abuse were also more likely to be admitted to inpatient care (58.8% vs. 34.7% of 
all visits), and among patients admitted, they had greater mean length of stay in the hospital 
(7.97 days, 95% CI 6.89–9.05 vs. 5.08 days, 95% CI 5.00–5.16).
Based on multivariable logistic regression, women had 1.95 times the odds of being 
diagnosed with elder abuse compared to men (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.68–2.26) after adjusting 
for age, comorbidity, common ED diagnoses, hospital teaching status, and hospital region 
(Table 3). There were no age categories with a significantly increased odds of the diagnosis 
of elder abuse. When compared to patients without a given CCS diagnosis, the following 
were associated with increased odds of the diagnosis of elder abuse: contusion (OR 2.91, 
95% CI 2.36–3.57), urinary tract infection (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.84–2.65), and septicemia 
(OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.44–2.55). The only diagnosis associated with a decreased odds of the 
diagnosis of elder abuse was abdominal pain (OR 0.34 95% CI 0.20–0.58). Visits by patients 
seen at metropolitan teaching hospitals had 1.74 times the odds of having a diagnosis of 
elder abuse compared to visits by patients seen at a metropolitan non-teaching hospitals (OR 
1.74 95% CI 1.42–2.14). A logistic regression model using the broad definition of elder 
abuse yielded similar results, except for increasing age was associated with decreasing odds 
of elder abuse diagnosis (Appendix 1).
To ensure correct weighting of NEDs data our estimates were cross-referenced to HCUPnet 
estimates and were found to be in agreement.30,32 Among the variables examined, missing 
data is described in Appendix 2.
In the 2011 NHAMCS, no diagnoses of elder abuse were made among the 5,965 visits by 
adults aged 60 years and older. In an attempt to determine if 2011 was an outlier, calendar 
years 2006–2010 were analyzed and a similarly low numbers of visits diagnosed with elder 
abuse were found: one of 6,224 (2006), one of 6,495 (2007), one of 6,528 (2008), zero of 
6,484 (2009), and one of 6,562 (2010). The unweighted period prevalences for these years 
range from 0 to 0.016%. However, according to the NHAMCS analysis guidelines, 
outcomes cannot be reported with less than ten cases, and when all years from 2006–2011

 were combined, there were still fewer than 10 cases. Therefore, no further analysis was 
conducted using the NHAMCS data.
DISCUSSION
In our analysis of NEDS, the largest available all-payer ED dataset, we find the period 
prevalence of a diagnosis of elder abuse among ED visits by adults aged 60 years and older 
is at least two orders of magnitude lower than available estimates for community-dwelling 
older adults (0.01% vs. 5–10%).9 Using a broader definition of elder abuse which includes 
cases of intimate partner violence, the number of cases we identified doubled but the 
percentage of patients diagnosed with elder abuse remained two orders of magnitude lower 
than the estimated prevalence among community-dwelling older adults. In a separate 
analysis of the six most recent years of NHAMCS data, so few cases of elder abuse were 
found that results cannot be reported.
These findings suggest that emergency physicians are failing to make the diagnosis of elder 
abuse for the vast majority of victims for whom they provide care. A different interpretation 
of these data is that prior estimates of elder abuse are inaccurate, but this explanation seems 
unlikely given prior studies, which consistently observe prevalences between 5% and 
10%.9–11 In a single academic ED, Stevens et al. found nine of 138 (7%) patients aged 65 
years and older reported physical or psychological abuse in the past year, but none were 
identified by the emergency physician.10 Among community dwelling older adults known to 
be victims of elder abuse, Lachs et al. found that only fifty two out of 572 visits (9%) 
resulted in referral for an abuse investigation from ED personnel.11 Among older adults 
presenting to a single ED in Singapore, Cham et al. found 17 cases of elder abuse identified 
by emergency providers among 62,826 visits, yielding a prevalence of the diagnosis of 
0.03%, which is similar to our findings.33
A number of explanations have been offered for why emergency physicians do not make the 
diagnosis of elder abuse. One explanation is that elder abuse is difficult to identify. The 
elderly have a greater burden of health problems than younger individuals, and thus an ED 
visit by victims of elder abuse may be for an injury or illness unrelated or only indirectly 
related to elder abuse. Some victims of elder abuse may lack the mental capacity to report 
abuse, or may not feel empowered to report abuse due to a fear of retribution or an externally 
imposed solution, such as being moved to a nursing home. Additionally due to physiological 
changes, comorbid conditions, and medications such as blood-thinners, fractures and 
bruising can result from even minimal trauma in older adults making it difficult to 
differentiate between accidental and inflicted trauma. Unlike the well described findings 
shown to be suggestive of child abuse, injury patterns and radiological findings suggestive of 
elder abuse are only beginning to be described.34,35 An estimated 39% of cases of elder 
abuse are neglect,36 which may be a particularly difficult form of abuse to identify because 
the clinical manifestations of neglect may look similar to progression of an illness occuring 
despite appropriate care.
Furthermore, emergency physicians may be less aggressive about diagnosing elder abuse 
because of a lack of formal training in recognizing elder abuse, because they tend to focus

 on the immediate medical problem and less on identifying underlying conditions, or because 
they are unsure about the necessary actions to improve outcomes for patients.37 Finally, the 
desire to ensure timely care for all patients and volume-based reimbursement mechanisms 
incentivize U.S. emergency physicians to make rapid dispositions. Assessing patients for 
elder abuse takes time, and acting on a suspicion of elder abuse to notify adult protective 
services (APS) and ensure the patient’s immediate safety is almost certain to delay 
disposition.
The aforementioned challenge of recognizing if a patient is or is not a victim of elder abuse 
raises a key challenge in this work: any method used to identify elder abuse, must also weigh 
the harms of falsely identifying elder abuse when it is not present and the risks associated 
with over diagnosis. One solution to this problem is that screening instruments should be 
used not to define the presence of elder abuse but, rather, to define patients who appear to be 
possible victims of elder abuse, triggering a more careful assessment by an ED clinical 
provider or social worker rather than an immediate call to APS. Of course any such 
approach will need to be mindful of mandatory reporting laws, which typically require APS 
referral for any patients for whom there is a reasonable cause for concern.
An alternative explanation for the extremely low prevalence of the diagnosis of elder abuse 
in these datasets is that emergency providers are making the diagnosis of elder abuse, or at 
least suspecting it, and possibly reporting their concerns to APS, but not recording elder 
abuse as a formal diagnosis which translates into an ICD-9 diagnosis code. Although this 
explanation likely partly explains the low prevalence of the diagnosis of elder abuse in these 
datasets, we believe this explanation is inadequate. Child abuse in the US has an estimated 
prevalence of 5%38 which is similar to the estimated prevalence of elder abuse. But, among 
children aged 0 to 3, the percentage of visits in which child abuse is diagnosed in NEDS is 
1.2%.39 This is 100 times the percentage of visits diagnosed with elder abuse. In NEDS the 
estimated prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV) among women aged 18–64 years is 
0.07%.20,30 Thus, the percentage of visits resulting in a diagnosis of IPV is 5 times the 
percentage of visits by older adults diagnosed with elder abuse, even though the estimated 1 
year prevalence of IPV among women in the US (1.3%) is 4 times lower than the lowest 
estimates of the prevalence of elder abuse among community dwelling older adults.40 The 
substantially higher rates of diagnosis of child abuse and IPV in recent analyses of NEDS 
suggests that the low rate of diagnosis of elder abuse results from a failure of emergency 
providers to identify this problem rather than a failure of the dataset to capture diagnoses 
being made by physicians.
Our findings from the NEDS analysis allow us to examine associations between patient and 
hospital characteristics and the diagnosis of elder abuse. Consistent with other work, women 
in the NEDS sample were more likely to be diagnosed with elder abuse, and the strength of 
association was similar to what is described in non-ED settings.12,41 A prior study found 
lower rates of elder abuse with advancing age,42 we observed this association using our 
broad definition of elder abuse, but not the restricted definition. Our analysis suggests that 
neglect and physical abuse are more often diagnosed in the ED than sexual or psychological 
abuse. The nearly three fold increased odds of elder abuse among patients with contusions in 
this study is consistent with prior research,33,35 and is likely already a factor that prompts 
Evans et al.

 consideration of abuse for some providers. The finding that victims of elder abuse are more 
likely to be admitted, and once admitted, have longer lengths of stay, suggests that 
interventions are occurring to address the abuse, or, alternatively, suggest an opportunity for 
interventions. Our findings also illustrate there is variation in elder abuse diagnoses across 
hospital characteristics, including hospital region and teaching status. Because of the very 
low proportion of cases identified relative to the presumed prevalence among these patients, 
it is not possible to know whether these associations indicate settings where there are higher 
percentages of visits made by victims of elder abuse or settings in which the diagnosis is 
made more frequently.
A strength of this study is the very large sample size in the NEDS which identified over 
3,000 cases of elder abuse across the United States. A second strength is the analysis of two 
different nationally representative datasets with slightly different data elements. The results 
from these two datasets, including a total of 4 cases of elder abuse diagnosed over a period 
of 6 years in NAHMCS and a similarly small proportion of cases in NEDS, provide similar 
estimates to those reported in Singapore, which further strengthens the validity of our 
findings.
This study has several limitations. Our estimates are based on ICD-9 diagnosis codes, which 
may not capture all visits in which elder abuse was suspected or even acted on by the 
emergency provider.43 There is no ICD-9 code for possible or suspected abuse, nor is there a 
code for financial exploitation, an increasingly prevalent type of elder abuse.9,44 We did not 
have information on chief complaint, functional status, mode of arrival, or who lives with the 
patient, all of which could be important in understanding which patients are likely to be 
victims of elder abuse. Another limitation is the inability to estimate prevalences in racial 
minorities (race is not recorded in NEDS), who may be at higher risk of elder abuse.12 Also, 
our multivariable analysis groups all types of elder abuse into one aggregate outcome, but 
the predictors of elder abuse diagnosis may differ depending on the type of abuse.45
Although there are limitations to NEDS and NAHMCS, both have the potential to provide 
important information on temporal changes in the diagnosis of elder abuse. Our results also 
have important implications for multiple stake-holders. For educators and guideline 
developers, there is a need for the development of methods to efficiently identify elder abuse 
in the ED, and develop interventions which improve outcomes for these patients.46,47 A 
possible way to approach the challenge of identifying elder abuse in the ED is routine 
screening of all older adults or targeted screening of high risk patients. Defining a high risk 
subgroup of patients will require further prospective work to characterize the clinical 
presentation of victims of elder abuse. The development of screening strategies must also 
consider who would administer the screener and consider the benefits of true positives and 
the harms of misclassifcation. In regard to the former, we think the nurse, rather than the 
triage nurse, is the person best positioned to identify elder abuse. For policy-makers and 
payers, there is a need to improve the confidence in population-based estimates of elder 
abuse in the ED setting. Data sources like NEDS or NHAMCS provide powerful disease 
surveillance opportunities but only if the data accurately capture the diagnosis. More specific 
diagnosis codes in ICD-10 designating suspected abuse as well as changes in Diagnosis 
Related Groups (DRG) reimbursements have been proposed.48,49 Given likely limitations to

 routine screening, a team approach that leverages the various skills and vantage points of all 
care providers that intersect with the patients in the ED may be necessary.50 Given the large 
societal cost of elder abuse, additional federal funding to develop and implement screening 
tools may be warranted.
CONCLUSION
Across United States EDs, a formal diagnosis of elder abuse is made in less than 0.02% of 
visits by patients aged 60 years and older despite an estimated prevalence of elder abuse in 
the community of 5–10%. Our findings expose, on a national-level, the failure of US EDs to 
address a major public health problem. Efforts to improve the identification of elder abuse 
among ED patients and link these patients to effective interventions are needed.
