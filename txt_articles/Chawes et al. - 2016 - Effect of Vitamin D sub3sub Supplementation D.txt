IMPORTANCE Observational studies have suggested that increased dietary vitamin D intake
during pregnancy may protect against wheezing in the offspring, but the preventive effect of
vitamin D supplementation to pregnant women is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether supplementation of vitamin D3 during the third trimester
of pregnancy reduces the risk of persistent wheeze in the offspring.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A double-blind, single-center, randomized clinical trial
conducted within the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 cohort.
Enrollment began March 2009 with a goal of 708 participants, but due to delayed ethical
approval, only 623 women were recruited at 24 weeks of pregnancy. Follow-up of the children
(N = 581) was completed when the youngest child reached age 3 years in March 2014.
INTERVENTIONS Vitamin D3 (2400 IU/d; n = 315) or matching placebo tablets (n = 308) from
pregnancy week 24 to 1 week postpartum. All women received 400 IU/d of vitamin D3 as part
of usual pregnancy care.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Age at onset of persistent wheeze in the first 3 years of life.
Secondary outcomes included number of episodes of troublesome lung symptoms, asthma,
respiratory tract infections, and neonatal airway immunology. Adverse events were assessed.
RESULTS Of the 581 children, persistent wheeze was diagnosed during the first 3 years of life
in 47 children (16%) in the vitamin D3 group and 57 children (20%) in the control group.
Vitamin D3 supplementation was not associated with the risk of persistent wheeze, but the
number of episodes of troublesome lung symptoms was reduced, and the airway immune
profile was up-regulated (principal component analysis, P = .04). There was no effect on
additional end points. Intrauterine death was observed in 1 fetus (<1%) in the vitamin D3
group vs 3 fetuses (1%) in the control group and congenital malformations in 17 neonates
(5%) in the vitamin D3 group vs 23 neonates (8%) in the control group.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The use of 2800 IU/d of vitamin D3 during the third trimester
of pregnancy compared with 400 IU/d did not result in a statistically significant reduced risk
of persistent wheeze in the offspring through age 3 years. However, interpretation of the
study is limited by a wide CI that includes a clinically important protective effect.

A
sthma often begins in early childhood and is the most
common chronic childhood disorder.1 The incidence
has increased during the last half-century in western-
ized societies, presumably related to a changing lifestyle or en-
vironmentinducingimmunederegulationinearlylifeandsub-
sequent chronic inflammation.2 In parallel, vitamin D
deficiency has also become a common health problem in west-
ernized societies, possibly caused by a more sedentary in-
door lifestyle and decreased intake of vitamin D containing
foods.3 Vitamin D possesses a range of immune regulatory
properties, and it has been speculated that vitamin D defi-
ciency during pregnancy may affect fetal immune program-
ming and contribute to asthma pathogenesis.4,5
This hypothesis is supported by a recent observational
study in the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in
Childhood 2000 (COPSAC2000) high-risk birth cohort show-
ing an association between low cord blood vitamin D levels
and an increased risk of childhood wheezing.6 Results of
other studies have been ambiguous, as some showed an
association between decreased maternal dietary vitamin D
intake7,8 or decreased cord blood vitamin D levels6,9,10 and
increased risk of wheezy disorders, whereas others reported
no such association.11,12
Therefore, we conducted the COPSAC 2010 (COPSAC2010)
Vitamin D RCT, a double-blind RCT of vitamin D3 supplemen-
tation during pregnancy in the 2010 population-based
COPSAC mother-child cohort, to assess the potential effect
on risk of persistent wheeze during the first 3 years of life.13
Methods
The trial protocol and statistical analysis plan are available in
Supplement 1.14
The COPSAC2010 study was approved by the local ethics
committee with a separate approval for the vitamin D3 during
pregnancy RCT, by the Danish Data Protection Agency, and by
the Danish Health and Medicines Authority. Written and oral
informed consent were obtained at enrollment of partici-
pants.
Study Design
This double-blind, placebo-controlled study identified preg-
nant women in Denmark by reviewing monthly the lists of
reimbursements to general physicians for first pregnancy vis-
its. The identified women received a written invitation to
contact the COPSAC clinic by telephone, and they were given
detailed verbal information and screened for eligibility.
Thereafter, detailed information was sent and the first visit to
the clinic was planned within pregnancy weeks 22 through
26. Exclusion criteria were gestational age above week 26;
any endocrine, cardiovascular, or nephrological disorders; or
vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) intake more than 600 IU/d.13
The offspring were recruited to the COPSAC2010 birth
cohort and followed up by the study pediatricians with
scheduled visits at 1 week, 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36
months, and with acute visits for any respiratory or skin-
related symptoms. The symptom burden between visits was
captured with daily diary cards monitoring: (1) significant
troublesome lung symptoms including components of
cough, wheeze, and dyspnea; (2) skin symptoms; and
(3) respiratory tract infections. The study pediatricians acted
as general practitioners for the cohort and were solely
responsible for diagnosis and treatment of persistent wheeze,
asthma, allergy, and eczema adhering to predefined algo-
rithms and blinded to the intervention.13
Study Intervention
Women were randomized 1:1 to a daily dose of 2400 IU vita-
min D3 supplementation or matching placebo tablets
(Camette A/S) from pregnancy week 24 to 1 week postpar-
tum. In addition, all women were instructed to continue
supplementation of 400 IU of vitamin D3 during pregnancy
as recommended by the Danish National Board of Health;
thus, the study is a dose comparison of 2800 IU/d vs
400 IU/d of vitamin D3 supplementation. Women were ran-
domized using a computer-generated list of random num-
bers, supplied by an external investigator who had no fur-
ther involvement in the RCT. The intervention code was
unblinded when the youngest child reached age 3 years or in
case of a medical emergency.
The mother’
s serum vitamin D level was measured15,16
at time of randomization corresponding to pregnancy week
24 and at the first visit after birth (ie, 1 week postpartum)
(Supplement 2), when the women stopped the supplement.
This allowed assessment of adherence to the treatment
plan, which was further complemented by counting
returned tablets.
All the women also participated in a concomitant facto-
rial designed, double-blind RCT of 2.4 g per day of long-chain
n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) during pregnancy
(ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00798226).
Primary End Point
Persistentwheezewasdiagnosedaccordingtoapreviouslyvali-
dated quantitative algorithm17,18 requiring all of the follow-
ing: (1) recurrent wheeze (verified diary recordings of ≥5 epi-
sodes of troublesome lung symptoms [cough, wheeze, and/or
dyspnea] lasting ≥3 days within 6 months), (2) typical symp-
toms of asthma (eg, exercise-induced symptoms, prolonged
nocturnal cough, or persistent cough outside common cold),
(3) need for intermittent bronchodilator, and (4) response to
a 3-month trial of inhaled corticosteroids and relapse upon
cessation.17 Risk of persistent wheeze analyzed by age-at-
onset analysis (Cox proportional hazards regression model)
from birth to age 3 years was the primary end point.
Secondary End Points
Asthma was diagnosed in children fulfilling the persistent
wheeze criteria at age 3 years.
Episodes of troublesome lung symptoms included the
number of episodes of troublesome lung symptoms lasting 3
or more consecutive days in the first 3 years of life.
Upper respiratory tract infections included episodes of
common cold, acute tonsillitis, croup, and acute otitis media
until age 3 years.13

Lowerrespiratorytractinfectionsincludedpneumoniaand
bronchiolitis. Pneumonia was diagnosed in children with sig-
nificant cough, tachypnea, fever, and abnormal lung stethos-
copy, whereas bronchiolitis was defined as cough, tachyp-
nea, chest retractions, auscultative widespread crepitation, or
rhonchi in an infant below 1 year.19-21
Airway immunology was assessed at age 1 month by
measuring unstimulated levels of 20 cytokines and chemo-
kines in airway mucosal lining fluid sampled by a nasosorp-
tion technique as previously detailed22-24 (Supplement 2).
The 20 cytokines and chemokines include interleukin
(IL)-12p70, CXCL10 (interferon gamma-induced protein
[IP]-10), interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α,
CCL4 (macrophage inflammatory protein [MIP]-1β), CCL2
(monocyte chemoattractant protein [MCP]-1), CCL13
(MCP-4), IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, CCL11 (eotaxin-1), CCL26
(eotaxin-3), CCL17 (thymus- and activation-regulated chemo-
kine [TARC]), CCL22 (macrophage-derived chemokine
[MDC]), IL-17, IL-1β, CXCL8 (IL-8), transforming growth fac-
tor (TGF)-β1, IL-10, and IL-2.
Systemic low-grade inflammation was determined by
measuring serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive pro-
tein, IL-6, TNF-α, and CXCL8 (also known as IL-8) at age 6
months.25
Allergic sensitization was diagnosed at 6 and 18 months by
any skin prick test (ALK-Abelló) result 2 mm or larger or spe-
cific immunoglobulin E (IgE) level of 0.35 kUA/L or higher
against raw milk, pasteurized eggs, dogs, or cats (ImmunoCAP;
Thermo Fischer Scientific).13
Eczema at age 0 through 3 years was diagnosed accord-
ing to the criteria of Hanifin and Rajka26 including typical mor-
phology and localization of skin lesions.27,28
Safety
Parents were routinely interviewed about the mother’
s medi-
cal history during pregnancy and the health of the child(ren)
at all scheduled and unscheduled visits to the research unit.
All diagnoses were registered online in the dedicated COPSAC
database.
Study Power
The prespecified sample size calculation found that 708 par-
ticipants (354 in each group) would be required to obtain 80%
power to detect a difference between the treatment groups
(2-tailed α = .05) based on a 12% expected frequency of per-
sistent wheeze in the control group (estimated from the 16.5%
observed in the COPSAC2000 high-risk cohort) and an effect of
0.5 in the vitamin D3 group.

Statistical Analysis
The effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on the primary end
point, age at onset of persistent wheeze, as well as lower re-
spiratory infections and eczema, was analyzed by Cox propor-
tional hazards regression, for which P values correspond to
Wald tests. The children were retained in the model from birth
until age of diagnosis, drop out, or age at their last clinic visit
before the RCT was unblinded.
The effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on the cross-
sectional end points of asthma and allergic sensitization was
analyzed by logistic regression, whereas the effect on num-
ber of episodes of troublesome lung symptoms and upper re-
spiratory tract infections was analyzed by a generalized esti-
mating equation Poisson regression model taking account of
repeated participant measurements.
The effect on airway immunology in the vitamin D3 group
vs control group was analyzed and visualized by a principal
component analysis (PCA)29 capturing the overall immuno-
logical trends in the data and their relation to the interven-
tion analyzed by Wilcoxon rank sum test. Initially, the media-
tor levels were log-transformed. Prior to the PCA the variables
were scaled to unit variance.

The primary analysis of age at onset of persistent wheeze
was an intention-to-treat analysis, which is presented crude
and adjusted for sex, birth season, maternal vitamin D level
atrandomization,andparticipationinthePUFARCT.A2-sided
P value of .05 for significance was used in all types of analy-
ses, which were conducted using SAS (SAS Institute), version
9.3, and MATLAB R2014a (Natick). No imputation was per-
formed for missing data.
Additional methodological details are outlined in
Supplement 2 and the COPSAC2010 design paper.13
Results
Of 1876 pregnant Danish women screened for eligibility to
the COPSAC2010 mother-child cohort, 1138 were not
included or declined to participate. We randomized 623 of
the 738 eligible women from March 4, 2009, to November
17, 2010, as the ethical approval of the vitamin D trial was
delayed during enrollment of the first 115 eligible women
into the COPSAC2010 cohort. In addition, 43 women were
withdrawn before childbirth. We unblinded 8 randomiza-
tions during pregnancy (including 4 intrauterine deaths)
and 3 children were excluded due to chronic disorders, leav-
ing 581 children for the primary analysis (Figure 1). The
clinical follow-up rate of the children was 94% at age 3
years.
At randomization, 52% of the women had sufficient
vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D) levels (>30 ng/mL; to con-
vert to nmol/L, multiply by 2.496), 34% had insufficient lev-
els (20-30 ng/mL) and 14% had deficient levels (<20 ng/mL).
Baseline characteristics of the participating mother-child
pairs are outlined in Table 1 showing no clinically important
differences in maternal serum vitamin D levels at random-
ization (mean [SD] level: 31 ng/mL [10] for the vitamin D3
group vs 31 ng/mL [10] for the control group) or season of
birth (eg, winter birth: 36% for the vitamin D3 group vs 36%
for the control group).
Adherence to the intervention, defined as mothers tak-
ing more than 80% of the prescribed tablets, was 74%. The in-
tervention resulted in a significant increase in maternal se-
rum vitamin D level in the treatment group (mean [SD] at
randomization vs postpartum: vitamin D3 group, 31 ng/mL [10]
at randomization vs 43 ng/mL [14] postpartum; control group,
31 ng/mL [10] at randomization vs 29 ng/mL [13] postpartum;
mean between-group difference, 13 ng/mL [95% CI, 11-16],
P < .001) (eFigure in Supplement 2). Correspondingly, the per-
centage of women with sufficient levels of vitamin D
(>30 ng/mL) after the intervention was 81% in the vitamin D3
group compared with 44% in the control group (mean differ-
ence, 37% [95% CI, 30%-45%], P < .001).
Vitamin D3 Supplementation and Risk of Persistent Wheeze
During the first 3 years of life, persistent wheeze was diag-
nosed in 104 (18%) of the 581 children, with 47 affected chil-
dren(16%)inthevitaminD3groupvs57affectedchildren(20%)
in the control group. The intention-to-treat analysis of age at
onset of persistent wheeze did not show a significant effect on
risk of persistent wheeze from vitamin D3 supplementation
during pregnancy (hazard ratio [HR], 0.76 [95% CI, 0.52-
1.12], P = .16) (Figure 2).
Sex, season of birth, maternal vitamin D3 level at random-
ization, and the long-chain n-3 PUFA RCT did not interact with
the supplementation effect (P > .05 for all interaction analy-
ses). Adjusting the primary analysis for these variables did not
modify the results (HR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.51-1.10], P = .14)
(Table 2). An analysis of the full 3 to 5 years follow-up at the
timeofunblindingofthestudyshowedsimilarresults(HR,0.78
[95% CI, 0.54-1.13], P = .20).
A post hoc analysis of the effect of vitamin D3 levels after
the intervention showed a reduced risk of persistent wheeze
per 4 ng/mL increase in maternal serum vitamin D level after
intervention (HR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.89-0.99], P = .03). Accord-
ingly, the risk of persistent wheeze was increased in children
born to mothers with postinterventional vitamin D3 levels in
the lowest vs middle and upper tertiles (Figure 3). These
findings are consistent with the effect estimate for persistent
wheeze of 0.76 (approximately 20% reduced risk) associated
with the intervention, which on average resulted in a 13
ng/mL higher level of vitamin D after the intervention.
Adjusting the analysis for sex, season of birth, maternal
smoking during pregnancy, and vitamin D3 level at random-
ization did not modify the result (HR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.88-
0.99], P = .02).
Vitamin D3 Supplementation and Secondary End Points
Episodes of Troublesome Lung Symptoms
Vitamin D3 supplementation during pregnancy resulted in sig-
nificantly fewer episodes of troublesome lung symptoms dur-
ing the first 3 years of life in the vitamin D3 group vs the con-
trol group (mean episodes, 5.9 in the vitamin D3 group vs 7.2
in the control group; incidence risk ratio [IRR], 0.83 [95% CI,
0.71-0.97], P = .02 (Table 2).

Asthma
Asthma at age 3 years was diagnosed in 69 children (13%) of
549, with 32 children (12%) in the vitamin D3 group and 47 chil-
dren (14%) in the control group (odds ratio [OR], 0.82 [95% CI,

(eTable 2 in Supplement 2).
Respiratory Tract Infections
Vitamin D3 supplementation did not modify the number of
upper respiratory tract infections (5.2/y in the vitamin D3
group vs 5.3/y in the control group; IRR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.90-
1.09], P = .84) or lower respiratory tract infections at age 0 to
3 years (94 children [32%] in the vitamin D3 group vs 95 chil-
dren [33%] in the control group; HR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.72-1.27],
P = .76).
Allergic Sensitization
The risk of allergic sensitization was not significantly af-
fected by the vitamin D3 supplement assessed by either skin
prick test (OR, 1.24 [95% CI, 0.66-2.31], P = .51) or specific IgE
level (OR, 1.55 [95% CI, 0.89-2.73], P = .13).

Eczema
Eczema development was unaffected by the intervention (68

group; HR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.65-1.26], P = .55).

nates (8%) in the control group, and child hospitalization after
birth in 32 children (11%) in the vitamin D3 group vs 28 children
(10%) in the control group (eTable 3 in Supplement 2).
Discussion
Maternal supplementation with 2800 IU/d vs 400 IU/d of vi-
tamin D3 during the third trimester of pregnancy did not re-
sult in a reduced risk of persistent wheeze through age 3 years
in the offspring. However, a clinically important protective ef-
fectcannotbeexcludedasthelowerlimitoftheHRCIwas0.52.
The possibility of a protective effect is further supported by
secondary end point analyses showing a significant reduc-
tion in number of episodes of troublesome lung symptoms, an
up-regulated neonatal airway immune profile. However, the
development of asthma, upper and lower respiratory tract in-
fections, allergic sensitization, and eczema was unaffected by
the vitamin D3 supplementation.

Panel A, 0/0 is the base for
interpreting how well a particular
mediator is explained. Increasing
length of the arrows from 0/0
corresponds to an increased
proportion of the mediator being
explained by the model. Principal
component 1 reflects the overall
immune activity regardless of
individual mediators, accounting for
54% of the variation in data. Principal
component 2 reflects a pattern related
to pertubation of CCL17, CCL2, CCL11,
CCL13, and TGF-1β vs IL-12p70, IL-10,
IL-13, IL-5, IFN-γ, IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-4, IL-2,
and IL-17α, accounting for additionally
8% of the variation. Thus, children
with loading values above 0 on
principal component 2 have an
immune profile skewed toward CCL17,
CCL2, CCL11, CCL13, and TGF-1β,
whereas children with loading values
below 0 have an immune profile
skewed toward IL-12p70, IL-10, IL-13,
IL-5, IFN-γ, IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-4, IL-2, and
IL-17α. Panel B, each point corresponds
to a child, and 2 points closely
positioned indicate a similar profile.
The ellipses reflect the 2-dimensional
distribution of children in the vitamin
D3 group (orange) vs control group
(blue), for which 0/0 is the
multivariate average of the
distribution. Principal component 1
reflects a significant discrepancy
between the groups (P = .04), pointing
at generally higher airway immune
activity in children from mothers
supplemented with vitamin D3
during pregnancy.

Also, we may have begun supplementation too late, while only
81% of the women had serum vitamin D3 above 30 ng/mL after
the intervention. Initiating vitamin D3 supplementation at ear-
lier pregnancy stages may be beneficial, as recent data in hu-
mans suggest that vitamin D affects fetal lung development as
early as the start of the second trimester.32 However, our data
suggesting no effect of early (pre-intervention) levels of vita-
min D argue against this hypothesis. Finally, the study did not
includepostnatalsupplementationofthechildren,whichcould
haveinducedanadditiveeffectiftheeffectsofmaternalsupple-
mentation declined postnatally.
The primary strength of the study is the single-center de-
sign with standardized diagnoses performed solely by the ex-
perienced COPSAC research pediatricians. Other multicenter
studies have used various clinicians with different training and
experience,whichmayintroducediagnosticheterogeneity.The
longitudinal clinical assessments at both scheduled and un-
scheduled visits to the research center accompanied by daily
diaryrecordingsoftroublesomelungsymptomstocapturedis-
ease burden between visits provided a highly specific pri-
mary end point with strong data on age at onset, which is a ma-
jor advantage compared with studies using retrospective or
cross-sectionalunspecificcommunity-baseddiagnoses.7-9This
approach is important as diagnosis of wheezy disorders in
young children is heterogeneous outside research settings due
to lack of objective tests and nonstandardized diagnostic
procedures.2 Our close clinical surveillance resulted in a high
follow-up rate of the children during the 3-year double-
blindedperiodwithmorethan94%completingtheyear3visit.
Vitamin D levels are associated with lifestyle factors such
as diet, sun exposure, physical activity, and tobacco smoke ex-
posure, which confer a risk of residual confounding in obser-
vational studies.33 Our placebo-controlled study design with
unbiased randomization mitigated such confounding and al-
lowed us to examine the isolated effect of vitamin D3 supple-
mentation.Inaddition,themothershadgoodadherencetothe
intervention with 74% taking more than 80% of the interven-
tion tablets with no differences between intervention groups.
Vitamin D deficiency may lead to wheezy disorders by in-
terfering with fetal lung cell maturation during pregnancy and
subsequent lung function development.34 An alternative
mechanism founded on alterations of the airway micro-
biome by induction of the antimicrobial cathelicidin in bron-
chial epithelial cells has also been proposed.35 It is a common
belief that vitamin D possesses a range of immune regulatory
properties, which are important for immune constitution in
early life.5 Our finding of a significantly up-regulated airway
immune profile at age 1 month in the vitamin D3 supple-
mented group supports this hypothesis and the interrelation-
ship between the relative up-regulations of immune media-
tors related to type 1, type 2, type 17, and regulatory immune
paths may protect against development of wheeze.
Vitamin D immune-modulatory mechanisms have been
suggested to increase the frequency of respiratory tract
infections,12leadingtovirus-inducedwheezing.36Suchapath-
way is not supported by our results showing no effect of vita-
min D3 supplementation on either upper or lower respiratory
tract infections.
Effective preventive strategies to alleviate the large bur-
den of childhood wheezing and related disorders represent a
major unmet clinical need. This RCT of vitamin D3 supple-
mentation during pregnancy did not show a statistically sig-
nificant effect on the primary end point of persistent wheeze,
although a clinically important protective effect cannot be ex-
cluded, and a protective effect is suggested by the observed
effect on airway immunology and symptomatic episodes.
Therefore, further studies with a larger sample size, higher
dose,andpotentiallyearlierinterventionduringpregnancyand
postnatal supplementation should be performed to establish
the potential benefits of vitamin D3 supplementation to preg-
nant women to reduce occurrence of wheezy disorders in the
offspring.
Conclusions
The use of 2800 IU/d of vitamin D3 during the third trimester
of pregnancy compared with 400 IU/d did not result in a sta-
tistically significant reduced risk of persistent wheeze in the
offspring through age 3 years. However, interpretation of the
study is limited by a wide CI that includes a clinically impor-
tant protective effect.
