Abstract
Background: Recent data suggest that the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be associated with re-
ductions in endometrial cancer risk, yet very few have examined whether their use is related to prognosis among endome-
trial cancer patients.
Methods: Study subjects comprised 4374 participants of the NRG Oncology/Gynecology Oncology Group 210 Study with
endometrial carcinoma who completed a presurgical questionnaire that assessed history of regular prediagnostic NSAID use and
endometrial cancer risk factors. Recurrences, vital status, and causes of death were obtained from medical records and cancer
registries. Fine-Gray semiproportional hazards regression estimated adjusted subhazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) for associations of NSAID use with endometrial carcinoma–specific mortality and recurrence. Models were stratified by endo-
metrial carcinoma type (ie, type I [endometrioid] vs type II [serous, clear cell, or carcinosarcoma]) and histology.
Results: Five hundred fifty endometrial carcinoma–specific deaths and 737 recurrences occurred during a median of five years of
follow-up. NSAID use was associated with 66% (HR¼ 1.66, 95% CI¼ 1.21 to 2.30) increased endometrial carcinoma–specific mortal-
ity among women with type I cancers. Associations were statistically significant for former and current users, and strongest
among former users who used NSAIDs for 10 years or longer (HR¼ 2.23, 95% CI¼ 1.19 to 4.18, two-sided Ptrend ¼ .01). NSAID use
was not associated with recurrence or endometrial carcinoma–specific mortality among women with type II tumors.
Conclusions: In this study, use of NSAIDs was associated with increased endometrial carcinoma–specific mortality, especially
in patients with type I tumors. Barring a clear biologic mechanism by which NSAIDs would increase the risk of cause-specific
mortality, cautious interpretation is warranted.

 There is increasing evidence that chronic inflammation is in-
volved in endometrial carcinogenesis and progression (1–3).
Recent data suggest that inhibition of inflammation through
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use is inversely
associated with endometrial cancer risk (4,5), most likely
through inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes.
Consistent data from several recent studies are highly sug-
gestive of a therapeutic benefit for aspirin and other NSAIDs
among colorectal cancer patients (6–11). Despite overlap in etio-
logic characteristics between cancers of the colorectum and en-
dometrium
(12,13)
and
an
overexpression
of
COX-2
in
endometrial cancers (14–16), no study has comprehensively ex-
amined whether NSAIDs improve prognosis among endome-
trial cancer patients. Here, we analyzed data from a large,
prospective observational investigation of the association be-
tween different types of NSAIDs (ie, aspirin, nonaspirin NSAIDs,
and COX-2 inhibitors) and endometrial carcinoma–specific sur-
vival
and
recurrence
in
the
NRG
Oncology/Gynecologic
Oncology Group (GOG) 210 Study. Prior data in postmenopausal
women suggest that NSAIDs reduce exposure to endogenous es-
trogens (17), which are important for endometrial proliferation
(18,19). Therefore, our primary hypothesis was that use of
NSAIDs would be associated with reduced carcinoma-specific
mortality and recurrence among patients diagnosed with type I
endometrial cancers, which are thought to be estrogen respon-
sive. Secondarily, we hypothesized that associations would dif-
fer by individual endometrial cancer histology.
Methods
Study Population
The NRG Oncology/GOG 210 Study (Clinical Trials.gov Identifier:
NCT00340808) was conducted from September 22, 2003, to
December 1, 2011, at 62 US institutions. Eligible subjects in-
cluded women with presurgical diagnoses of endometrial carci-
noma or carcinosarcoma who were eligible for surgery and had
not undergone prior retroperitoneal surgery or pelvic/abdomi-
nal radiation. Prior to surgery (hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-
oophorectomy, and lymph node sampling), consenting patients
completed a self-administered questionnaire that collected de-
mographic and epidemiologic information (20). On September
23, 2007, eligibility criteria in NRG Oncology/GOG 210 changed
from unrestricted enrollment to poor prognosis tumors and
cancers occurring among nonobese and nonwhite patients.
Follow-up information on causes of death and recurrence were
available through December 31, 2013.
Of 6124 women enrolled, 5492 (89.7%) completed question-
naires. We excluded women for the following reasons: incom-
plete surgical staging (n ¼ 20), final diagnosis not endometrial
carcinoma (n ¼ 53), benign diagnoses (n ¼ 6), diagnosis of a sec-
ond primary (n ¼ 2), misclassified pathologic diagnosis based on
central pathology review (n ¼ 49), inadequate material for pa-
thology review (n ¼ 22), protocol deviations (n ¼ 17), and im-
proper preprotocol treatment (n ¼ 1). We excluded cases with
missing grade (n ¼ 23), mixed epithelial tumors (n ¼ 556), mucin-
ous tumors (n ¼ 18), unusual histologic types (including squa-
mous cell, undifferentiated, and dedifferentiated histologies;
n ¼ 111),
missing
stage
(n ¼ 5),
and
unknown
NSAID
use
(n ¼ 235), leaving 4374 patients for analysis. This study was ap-
proved by institutional review boards at the National Cancer
Institute and participating study centers. All participants pro-
vided informed consent prior to participation.
Tumor Characteristics and Outcome Assessment
Endometrial tumors were classified as low-grade (grades 1 and 2)
endometrioid carcinoma (n ¼ 2657), high-grade (grade 3) endo-
metrioid carcinoma (n ¼ 582), serous carcinoma (n ¼ 663), carci-
nosarcoma (n ¼ 309), or clear cell carcinoma (n ¼ 163). We further
classified low- and high-grade endometrioid tumors as type I
(n ¼ 3239) and serous, clear cell, and carcinosarcomas as type II
(n ¼ 1135). Depth of myometrial invasion (negative, inner half,
outer half, serosa), stage according to International Federation
for Gynecology and Obstetrics 1988 criteria (21), pelvic and aortic
lymph
node
involvement,
peritoneal
cytology
results,
and
extra-uterine sites of metastasis were recorded. Diagnoses of
high-grade endometrioid carcinoma, serous carcinoma, clear cell
carcinoma, carcinosarcoma, and tumors involving the cervix or
with non-nodal metastases were reviewed centrally. Information
on recurrences, vital status, cause of death, date of events, and
adjuvant treatment (none, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, chemo-
therapy þ radiotherapy, or other therapy) were obtained from
medical records, supplemented with cancer registry information.
Recurrences were defined as evidence of a primary disease fol-
lowing complete response to therapy. Among the 4374 endome-
trial carcinoma patients enrolled in the GOG-210 Study, the
median follow-up was 60 months after diagnosis (range ¼ 1 day–
118 months), from which 550 carcinoma-specific deaths and 737
recurrences were recorded.
NSAIDS and Covariate Assessment
A standard risk factor questionnaire administered prior to sur-
gery included a detailed assessment of participants’ “regular”
use, defined as one or more per week for one or more years (or
more than 50 pills during any one-year period) of aspirin,
nonaspirin NSAIDs (including ibuprofen, naproxen, indometha-
cin, piroxicam, and sulindac), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in-
hibitors. For each NSAID type, we collected information on
duration of regular use (<1, 1–4.99, 5–9.99, and �10 years) and
recency of regular use (former, current) relative to the date the
questionnaire
was
completed.
We
created
combination
exposure
variables
of
recency
and
duration
based
on
cross-tabulations. A summary variable, “any NSAIDs,” was also
created. If a patient responded that she was a regular user of as-
pirin, nonaspirin NSAIDs, or COX-2 inhibitors, she was consid-
ered an ever user of “any NSAIDs.” If a woman reported use of
multiple NSAIDS, the longest duration of the three medications
was recorded as the duration of “any NSAID” use. Likewise, if a
woman reported current use of any of the three medications,
her status was recorded as current. NSAID data were available
in 4374 patients. Frequency distributions of epidemiologic fac-
tors and tumor characteristics were similar between the 235
women with unknown NSAID use and nonusers or users of any
NSAIDs (data not shown).
Information
on
demographic
characteristics
(age,
race,
annual income, education) and established endometrial carci-
noma risk factors, including anthropometric measures, repro-
ductive and menstrual characteristics, exogenous hormone use,
smoking status, and medical conditions, was also collected by
the questionnaire.
Statistical Analysis
Distributions of epidemiologic and tumor characteristics by any
NSAID use and by individual NSAIDs were compared using

 chi-square tests. In order to test our primary hypothesis that
NSAID use was inversely associated with endometrial carci-
noma–specific mortality and recurrence, we used the Fine and
Gray semiproportional model of competing risks (22), using
time since enrollment as the time metric, to estimate subhazard
ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) between NSAIDs
and risk of endometrial carcinoma outcomes. In analyses treat-
ing endometrial carcinoma–specific death as the outcome,
deaths from other causes were treated as competing risks. In
the recurrence analyses, deaths from all causes were treated as
competing events. Recurrence and cancer-specific mortality
were considered exclusive events in regression models (a
woman could have both events provided that recurrence pre-
ceded death). The proportionality of the subhazards were as-
sessed by evaluating the Wald P value for an interaction term,
including NSAID use and calendar time (23).
For each individual NSAID, we constructed minimally ad-
justed competing risk models that included age at diagnosis
(continuous) and stage (I, II, III, IV). Clinical, demographic, life-
style, and reproductive characteristics were explored as con-
founders and retained when inclusion of the factor changed
estimates in the minimally adjusted model by more than 10% or
when the model fit was statistically significantly improved as
assessed by the likelihood ratio (LR) test. Final models were ad-
justed for age (time variable), stage, ethnicity, education, in-
come, body mass index (kg/m2, BMI), and menopausal hormone
therapy. Tests for linear trend (Ptrend) were evaluated by gener-
ating orthogonal polynomial contrasts corresponding to the lev-
els of NSAID variables (24). We repeated the analyses stratified
by tumor histologic subtype. To test our secondary hypothesis
that associations differed by histology, a Pheterogeneity value was
calculated by including an interaction term in regression mod-
els between NSAID exposure variables and histologic subtype.
We tested for formal interactions between use of NSAIDs
and endometrial carcinoma–specific mortality and recurrence
and enrollment periods (2003–2007 vs 2007–2011) by including a
multiplicative interaction term between NSAID variables and a
binary variable indicating the enrollment period. Because no
differences by time period were observed, results are given here
using data from the entire cohort. The competing risk models
were conducted using STATA software (version 11, STATA
Corp., College Station, TX) while all other analyses were per-
formed using SAS (version 9.3, SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All P val-
ues were two-sided, and a P value of less than .05 was
considered statistically significant; for perspective, 44 compari-
sons were made to address our primary hypothesis.
Results
Descriptive characteristics of GOG-210 participants stratified on
NSAID use are given
in Table 1. Compared with NSAID
nonusers, NSAID users were more likely to be older, African
American, heavier, and smokers. NSAID users were also more
likely to be multiparous, users of menopausal hormone therapy
and/or tamoxifen, and to have a history of diabetes. NSAID use
was not clearly associated with any tumor characteristic, in-
cluding stage, histology, myometrial invasion, lymph node in-
volvement, peritoneal cytology, or peritoneal biopsy result.
With few exceptions, directions of associations between the
uses of individual NSAID groups (ie, aspirin, nonaspirin NSAIDs,
and COX-2 inhibitors) were consistent with the summary
variable.
Given the strong association between subtype and progno-
sis, we analyzed the relation between NSAID use and endome-
trial carcinoma–specific mortality stratified by cancer subtypes
(ie, types I and II). Relative to nonuse, any NSAID use was asso-
ciated with a 66% (HR ¼ 1.66, 95% CI ¼ 1.21 to 2.30) increased
risk of endometrial carcinoma–specific mortality among women
diagnosed with type I tumors (Table 2). The increased risk was
of similar magnitude for both former and current users and was
statistically significant with 10 or more years of use. When re-
cency and duration data were combined, the strongest associa-
tion was among former users who used NSAIDs for 10 or more
years (HR ¼ 2.23, 95% CI ¼ 1.19 to 4.18, Ptrend ¼ .01). Associations
for uses of individual NSAID classes (ie, aspirin, nonaspirin
NSAIDs, and COX-2 inhibitors) were similar to the summary
measure although statistically nonsignificant (Supplementary
Table 1, available online). There was no clear association be-
tween NSAID use and endometrial carcinoma–specific mortality
among women diagnosed with type II tumors. However, among
former users, women who used NSAIDs for 10 or more years
had approximately twofold increased risk (HR ¼ 1.92, 95% CI ¼
1.20 to 3.08, Ptrend ¼ .004) of endometrial carcinoma–specific
mortality relative to nonusers (Table 2). Results did not change
when patients were stratified on their stages at diagnosis (not
shown).
When cancers were further stratified by individual histolo-
gies (Table 3), NSAID use was associated with higher endome-
trial carcinoma–specific mortality for women diagnosed with
low-grade (HR ¼ 2.18, 95% CI ¼ 1.33 to 3.58) and high-grade
endometrioid tumors (HR ¼ 1.65, 95% CI ¼ 1.03 to 2.62), as well
as
carcinosarcomas
(HR
¼
1.54,
95%
CI ¼
1.00
to
2.38).
Associations were elevated in former and current users, but
only increased with increased duration of use for carcinosarco-
mas. There were no associations between NSAID use and endo-
metrial
carcinoma–specific
mortality
among
patients
with
serous or clear cell histologies.
Associations between NSAID use and endometrial carci-
noma recurrence, stratified by cancer subtype, are given in
Table 4. Unlike mortality, any NSAID use was not associated
with recurrence from type I endometrial carcinoma (HR ¼ 1.16,
95% CI ¼ 0.92 to 1.47). Although NSAID use was also generally
not associated with recurrence among women with type II tu-
mors, we did observe an increased recurrence risk among for-
mer users who used NSAIDs 10 or more years (HR ¼ 1.81, 95%
CI ¼ 1.19 to 2.74, Ptrend ¼ .004); however, there was no associa-
tion with increased duration among current users (Ptrend ¼ .60).
Point estimates were again similar when individual NSAIDs
were considered (Supplementary Table 2, available online).
When recurrence models were stratified by individual tumor
histologies (Table 5), any NSAID use was associated with a 54%
(HR ¼ 1.54, 95% CI ¼ 1.03 to 2.32) increased risk of recurrence
among women with high-grade endometrioid tumors and a sta-
tistically nonsignificant 47% (HR ¼ 1.47, 95% CI ¼ 0.97 to 2.23) in-
creased
risk
of
recurrence
among
women
with
carcinosarcomas. For each, neither association strengthened
with increased duration of use.
Discussion
In this prospective study of women with endometrial carci-
noma, we observed that NSAID use was associated with in-
creased risks of carcinoma-specific mortality and, to a lesser
extent, recurrence, especially among women diagnosed with
endometrioid
histology.

 enzymes, resulting in decreased synthesis of prostaglandins
and eicosanoids, among which several are associated with an-
giogenesis and tumor growth in endometrial tumors (1). In vitro
experimental studies have shown that inhibition of COX en-
zymes results in decreases in prostaglandin E2, aromatase, and
estrogen synthesis (25,26), which is particularly relevant be-
cause of the strong role that unopposed estrogens play in driv-
ing endometrial proliferation (18,19). Experimental findings are
further supported by positive correlations between expressions
of COX-2 and aromatase in endometrial cancer tissue (16) and
inverse associations between NSAID use and blood estrogen

 concentrations (17). Indeed, given these mechanisms of action,
we know of little reason why NSAID use would be associated
with increased risks of death or recurrence among endometrial
cancer patients. Recent data has suggested that endometrial
cancers are immunogenic, resulting in important therapeutic
and prognostic implications (especially related to the response
to PD-1/PD-L1 [ie, checkpoint] inhibitors) (27). It is plausible that
the anti-inflammatory effects of NSAIDs could modify the im-
mune environment of endometrial cancer through differential
cytokine recruitment that could negatively affect mortality.
Several prospective cohort studies (4,28–32) and randomized
controlled trials of aspirin (33–35) have examined associations
between NSAID use and endometrial cancer risk, with inconsis-
tent results. A 2013 meta-analysis of aspirin reported that its
use was associated with a 13% reduction in risk (relative risk
[RR] ¼ 0.87, 95% CI ¼ 0.79 to 0.96) (5). Two recent studies not in-
cluded in the meta-analysis published conflicting results: Use of
aspirin (HR ¼ 0.64, 95% CI ¼ 0.41 to 1.01, Ptrend ¼ .03) but not
nonaspirin NSAIDs was inversely associated with endometrial
cancer risk in the Vitamins and Lifestyle cohort, which included
262 cases (4), whereas no association was reported for either
medication in the Women’s Health Initiative Study, which in-
cluded 774 cases (28). Among randomized trials, no association
with endometrial cancer risk was reported in the Women’s
Health Study of 100 mg aspirin given every second day (HR ¼
1.00, 95% CI ¼ 0.83 to 1.20) (33,34). In contrast, a pooled analysis
of 51 randomized trials of aspirin for heart disease prevention
reported reduced uterine cancer incidence among women as-
signed to aspirin (P ¼ .003) (35), although the analysis relied
heavily upon small numbers of women and incident cases.
NSAIDs have been shown to play a chemopreventive and
therapeutic role in colorectal cancer across the continuum of tu-
morigenesis from polyp (36), to invasive disease (28,37), metas-
tasis (38,39), and mortality (6–11,40–42); yet to our knowledge
only two limited studies have examined the potential impact of
NSAIDs on endometrial cancer outcomes (43,44). In a retrospec-
tive medical record linkage study of 282 type II endometrial can-
cers (n ¼ 158 deaths), investigators correlated aspirin use with
carcinoma-specific mortality
in a
secondary
analysis (43).
Relative to nonuse, aspirin use was associated with a reduced
risk of death (HR ¼ 0.60, 95% CI ¼ 0.36 to 0.99) (43). This year,
Matsuo et al. (44) examined the relation between use of low-
dose (ie, �100 mg) aspirin and endometrial cancer–specific mor-
tality (n ¼ 127) and recurrence (n ¼ 226) in 1687 patients accrued
in California and Japan. Use vs nonuse of low-dose aspirin was
associated with reduced risks of each (recurrence: HR ¼ 0.46,
95% CI ¼ 0.25 to 0.86; disease-specific mortality: HR ¼ 0.23, 95%
CI¼ 0.08 to 0.64) (44). Our findings for aspirin (which included both
low- and regular-strength formulations) contrasted strongly from
those previously reported (43,44). Similar to our findings,
Matsuo et al. reported use of “other NSAIDs” to be associated
with increased risks of recurrence (HR ¼ 1.92, 95% CI ¼ 1.18

 to 3.13) (44); however, associations with disease-specific
mortality were not reported (44).
When recency and duration of NSAID use were considered
together in relation to endometrial carcinoma death, the associ-
ations were linear only among former users. We have no ready
explanation for why this might be. Implied from this finding
may be that past use of NSAIDs is associated with the develop-
ment of more aggressive tumors, independent of their putative
role on endometrial carcinoma risk; however, our data on stage
at diagnosis and other endometrial carcinoma characteristics
argues against this hypothesis. While it remains possible that
NSAID use affects molecular markers of an aggressive pheno-
type (such as COX-2 expression) early in tumorigenesis, such
data were not available for examination in this study. There are
limited data to support a role of NSAIDs in inducing or promot-
ing growth in benign endometrial tissues in women undergoing
hysterectomy. NSAIDs have been associated with loss of PTEN
expression (45) and insulin receptor expression (46), possibly in-
dicating aggressive molecular features.
In histology-stratified models, we observed similar patterns
of increased risk between NSAID use and carcinoma-specific
mortality among women with low-grade endometrioid, high-
grade endometrioid, or carcinosarcomas. The behavior of uter-
ine carcinosarcomas, which demonstrate malignant epithelial
and stromal components, is thought to be driven by the epi-
thelial
component
of
the
tumor
(47–50).
Similarities
in
outcomes associated with NSAID use could reflect a shared bi-
ology between endometrioid tumors and carcinosarcomas, a
hypothesis reinforced by overlap in etiologic factors for these
histologic subtypes, including obesity, parity, and cigarette
smoking (51–53).
This study has several strengths aside from its prospective
design and length of follow-up. With 3239 type I and 1135 type II
endometrial carcinoma patients, it is well powered to detect rel-
atively small associations. Given this large sample size, we were
able to examine associations with mortality and recurrence
stratified on cancer histology. The study is further strengthened
by its strong measurement of (and control for) potential con-
founding factors, including endometrial carcinoma risk factors
and tumor characteristics. Lastly, although not ideal, measure-
ment of NSAIDs included type (aspirin, nonaspirin, COX-2 in-
hibitors) as well as recency and duration.
There
are
also
limitations
that
should
be
considered.
Reported NSAID use was not validated, and data on the fre-
quency and dose of NSAIDs were not collected, possibly contrib-
uting
to
nondifferential
measurement
errors.
Given
the
prospective nature of the study, these errors would not explain
the increased risks we report; however, they may explain rela-
tively flat associations for duration of use. We were further lim-
ited in our ability to assess the potential for several indications
of NSAID use (eg, prevalent cardiovascular disease, arthritis) to
confound
associations.

 correlate of aspirin use, is among the most common causes of
all-cause mortality among women with endometrial cancer
(54). Yet it and other indications for NSAID use have not been
identified as risk factors for endometrial carcinoma–specific
mortality. Additionally, because of the relatively small numbers
of events among NSAID users in histology-stratified models, we
were unable to jointly examine associations with recency and
duration of NSAIDs. As with all observational analyses, it re-
mains possible that the associations reported here reflect, at
least to some degree, confounding from unmeasured or insuffi-
ciently measured factors. Lastly, due to the number of compari-
sons made, the play of chance cannot be ruled out.
In this large, prospective study of women diagnosed with en-
dometrial carcinoma, NSAID use was not associated with reduc-
tions in carcinoma-specific mortality or recurrence. Rather,
increases in risk of each outcome were observed, especially
among patients diagnosed with endometrioid histologies. Barring
a clear biologic mechanism by which NSAIDs would worsen prog-
nosis, our findings necessitate a cautious interpretation.
