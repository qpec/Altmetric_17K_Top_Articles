IMPORTANCE Early cardiovascular and bleeding events after coronary stenting are associated
with high risk of morbidity and mortality.
OBJECTIVE To assess the prognosis of cardiovascular and bleeding events occurring beyond
1 year after coronary stenting.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS ThissecondaryanalysisisderivedfromdatafromtheDual
AntiplateletTherapy(DAPT)Study,amulticentertrialinvolving220USandinternationalclinicalsites
from 11 countries. The study dates were August 2009 to May 2014. Individuals who underwent
coronary stenting and completed 12 months of thienopyridine plus aspirin therapy without
ischemic or bleeding events remained on an aspirin regimen and were randomized to continued
thienopyridine therapy vs placebo for 18 additional months. Individuals were then followed up
for 3 additional months while receiving aspirin therapy alone. The analysis began in August 2015.
EXPOSURES Ischemic events (myocardial infarction not related to stent thrombosis, stent
thrombosis, and ischemic stroke) and bleeding events (Global Utilization of Streptokinase
and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Arteries [GUSTO] classification moderate or
severe bleeding).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Ischemic events (myocardial infarction not related to
stent thrombosis, stent thrombosis, and ischemic stroke) and bleeding events (GUSTO
classification moderate or severe bleeding). Death at 21 months after randomization
(33 months after coronary stenting).
RESULTS Intotal,25682individualsolderthan18yearswithanindicationforcoronarystentingwere
enrolled,and11 648(meanage,61.3years;25.1%female)wererandomized.Afterrandomization,
478 individuals (4.1%) had 502 ischemic events (306 with myocardial infarction, 113 with stent
thrombosis,and83withischemicstroke),and232individuals(2.0%)had235bleedingevents(155
withmoderateand80withseverebleeding).Amongindividualswithischemicevents,52(10.9%)
died. The annualized mortality rate after an ischemic event was 27.2 (95% CI, 20.3-35.7) per
100 person-years. The cumulative incidence of death after an ischemic event among the total
randomized study population was 0.5% (0.3% with myocardial infarction, 0.1% with stent
thrombosis, and 0.1% with ischemic stroke). Among individuals with bleeding events, 41 (17.7%)
died. The annualized mortality rate after a bleeding event was 21.5 (95% CI, 15.4-29.1) per 100
person-years. The cumulative incidence of death after a bleeding event among the total
randomized study population was 0.3% (0.1% with moderate and 0.2% with severe bleeding).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In patients treated with dual antiplatelet therapy for at least
1 year after coronary stenting, ischemic events were more frequent than bleeding events, and
both events were associated with high risk of mortality.

A
dvances in the management of patients with coro-
nary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coro-
nary intervention (PCI) have reduced cardiovascular
events around the time of the procedure and within the first
year after PCI.1,2 However, the risk of recurrent ischemia re-
lated to atherosclerosis progression and thrombosis in stented
and nonstented coronary arteries persists indefinitely, de-
spite treatment and risk factor modification.3,4 Antiplatelet
medications, including aspirin and P2Y12 inhibitors, have be-
come the standard of care as they decrease the risk of myo-
cardialinfarction(MI)andstentthrombosis(ST)withinthefirst
year after PCI.5,6 While recent randomized trials7-9 have shown
the benefits of treatment beyond 1 year, these findings have
been counterbalanced by risks of bleeding, which are of par-
ticular concern with long-term therapy.
Althoughtheprognosisfollowingearlyischemicandbleed-
ing events has been well described,4,10-12 data for events oc-
curring beyond 1 year after PCI are limited.13 This scarcity may
result from smaller size and duration of PCI trials,14-16 while
larger observational studies often lack systematic follow-up or
independent event adjudication.11,12
We sought to assess the cumulative incidence of death af-
ter ischemic and bleeding events occurring among patients in
the Dual Antiplatelet Therapy (DAPT) Study beyond 1 year af-
ter coronary stenting.
Methods
Study Population
The DAPT Study (described previously8,17) was a random-
ized, double-blind trial comparing 12 vs 30 months of dual
antiplatelet therapy in individuals undergoing PCI with a
drug-eluting stent or a bare metal stent. The study involved
220 US and international clinical sites from 11 countries. After
coronary stenting, 25 682 enrolled patients older than 18
years were prescribed thienopyridine plus aspirin therapy for
12 months. At 12 months, treatment-adherent patients who
had no major adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular
events, recurrent revascularization, or moderate or severe
bleeding continued taking aspirin and were randomized to
continued thienopyridine therapy vs placebo for 18 addi-
tional months. Randomized treatment was then discontin-
ued, and patients were followed up for 3 additional months
while receiving aspirin therapy alone. During the 21-month
postrandomization period, all potential cardiovascular and
bleeding events were adjudicated by a clinical events com-
mittee masked to treatment assignment. This study was con-
ducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The
institutional review board at each institution approved the
study, and all participating patients provided written
informed consent. For the present secondary analysis, we
examined all 11 648 randomized individuals.
Outcomes and Exposures
The primary outcome was death at 21 months after random-
ization (33 months after coronary stenting). The primary ex-
posures were ischemic and bleeding events occurring 12 to 33
months after coronary stenting. Ischemic events included MI
not related to ST, definite or probable ST as defined by the Aca-
demic Research Consortium,18 and ischemic stroke. While car-
diovascular death as adjudicated in the DAPT Study included
deaths that were associated with a concurrent ischemic event
and deaths that could not be attributed to a noncardiovascu-
lar cause, only cardiovascular deaths related to MI, ST, or is-
chemic stroke were considered ischemic events in the pres-
ent study. Bleeding events included moderate or severe
bleeding as defined by the Global Utilization of Streptokinase
and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Arteries
(GUSTO) classification.19 As a secondary bleeding end point,
bleeding events were classified based on the Bleeding Aca-
demic Research Consortium (BARC) 2, 3, or 5 definitions.20 In-
tracranial hemorrhage (ICH) was classified as a BARC 3c bleed-
ing event or hemorrhagic stroke as defined previously.17
Statistical Analysis
Categorical variables were reported as counts and percent-
ages, and continuous variables were reported as means (SDs).
Between-group differences were assessed using Fisher exact
test or χ2 test for categorical variables and t test or Wilcoxon
rank sum test for continuous variables.
Among the randomized study population, we examined
(1) the rate of ischemic and bleeding events after randomiza-
tion, (2) the mortality risk among patients with each of these
events,and(3)thecumulativeincidenceofmortalityaftereach
event. Patients experiencing multiple ischemic and bleeding
events contributed data to both the ischemic events group and
the bleeding events group; however, for patients with more
than one of the same type of event, only the earliest event was
included. We used Kaplan-Meier methods to estimate the cu-
mulativeincidenceofdeathafteranischemicorbleedingevent
among those experiencing these events. Follow-up started at
the time of the event and continued until death or study
completion. Patients who died on the same day as the event
were included in the analysis. To quantify the total popula-
tionatriskofdeathafteranevent,weusedKaplan-Meiermeth-
ods to estimate the cumulative incidence of death after the
event among all randomized patients, with follow-up start-
ing at the time of randomization.

Key Points
Question What is the prognosis of ischemic and bleeding events
occurring beyond 1 year after coronary stenting?
Findings Among 11 648 individuals who underwent
randomization in the Dual Antiplatelet Therapy (DAPT) Study,
ischemic events occurred in 4%, 11% died, and the cumulative
incidence of death after an ischemic event was 0.5%. Bleeding
events occurred in 2%, 18% died, and the cumulative incidence of
death after a bleeding event was 0.3%.
Meaning Among patients surviving 1 year after coronary stenting,
ischemic events were more frequent than bleeding events, and
both events were associated with high risk of mortality.

exposure to evaluate the independent association of ischemic
events or bleeding events with mortality. The time-updated
model allowed for patients to contribute both unexposed
(ie, before event) and exposed (ie, after event) person-time. A
propensity score was calculated for each ischemic and bleed-
ing event using all collected covariates, including the random-
ization arm, and each Cox proportional hazards regression
model was stratified by propensity score quintile to control for
confounding.
A two-sided P < .05 was considered statistically signifi-
cant. Statistical analyses were performed using a software
program (SAS, version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc).
Results
Incidence and Mortality Risk of Ischemic Events
Among11 648randomizedpatients(meanage,61.3years;25.1%
female), 478 (4.1%) had 502 ischemic events by 21 months. Of
these 502 events, 306 (61.0%) were MI not related to ST, 113
(22.5%) were ST, and 83 (16.5%) were ischemic stroke. In ad-
dition,88patientshadcardiovasculardeathsthatwerenotdue
to MI, ST, or ischemic stroke. Of these cardiovascular deaths,
63 (71.6%) had identifiable causes, including sudden cardiac
death (n = 40), heart failure (n = 9), ventricular arrhythmia
(n = 4), and other events (n = 10).
Patients with ischemic events had a higher prevalence of
cardiovascular risk factors and prior cardiovascular disease
(Table 1). They also more often initially presented with non–
ST-segment elevation MI, had smaller minimum stent diam-
eters, and received more paclitaxel-eluting stents (Table 2). Pa-
tients with ischemic events were more often randomized to
placebo (283 patients [59.2%]) than to continued thienopyri-
dine therapy (195 patients [40.8%]) (P < .01).
The median follow-up time after an ischemic event was
275.0 days (interquartile range [IQR], 90.0-456.0 days).
Among the 478 patients with ischemic events, 52 (10.9%)
died, and 41 deaths (78.8%) were attributable to cardiovas-
cular causes. In comparison, of the 11 082 patients without a
cardiovascular event, 82 (0.7%) died (P < .001). The cumula-
tive incidence of death after an ischemic event among the
total randomized study population was 0.5% (0.3% with MI,
0.1% with ST, and 0.1% with ischemic stroke) (Figure 1). The
cumulative incidence of death for all cardiovascular events,
including cardiovascular deaths that were not due to MI, ST,
or ischemic stroke, was 1.3%. Death after ST or ischemic
stroke primarily occurred within 1 month of presentation,
whereas death after MI not related to ST occurred through-
out the follow-up period (median survival time, 67.5 days;
IQR, 4.0-281.0 days) (Figure 2). Nine ischemic events were
immediately fatal, which occurred mainly among patients
with ST (n = 8).

The unadjusted annualized mortality rate after an ische-
mic event was 27.2 (95% CI, 20.3-35.7) per 100 person-years.
Controlling for demographic characteristics, comorbid condi-
tions, and procedural factors, the occurrence of an ischemic
event was associated with a 12.6-fold (95% CI, 9.0-17.6) in-
creasedhazardofmortalitycomparedwiththeabsenceofsuch
event.RisksofdeathassociatedwithST(hazardratio[HR],14.6;
95% CI, 8.2-25.9) and ischemic stroke (HR, 13.1; 95% CI, 7.2-
23.8) were greater in magnitude compared with MI not re-
lated to ST (HR, 9.1; 95% CI, 6.1-13.6) (Table 3). Risks of death
within the first 30 days after an ischemic event and more than
30 days after the event are summarized in eTable 1 in the
Supplement.
Incidence and Mortality Risk of Bleeding Events
Among randomized patients, 232 (2.0%) had 235 bleeding
events. Of all bleeding events, 155 (66.0%) were moderate, and
80 (34.0%) were severe. Intracranial hemorrhage occurred in
47 of 11 648 (0.4%), of whom 23 (0.4%) were randomized to
continued thienopyridine therapy and 24 (0.4%) were ran-
domized to placebo (P = .88).
Patients with bleeding events had lower body mass in-
dex, were older, and demonstrated a higher prevalence of car-
diovascular risk factors and prior cardiovascular disease
(Table 1). They also had higher rates of prior cancer, were less
likely to have initially presented with non–ST-segment eleva-
tion MI at the time of PCI, and were more often randomized
to continued thienopyridine therapy (140 [60.3%]) than to pla-
cebo (92 [39.7%]) (P < .01) (Table 2).
Themedianfollow-uptimeafterableedingeventwas281.5
days (IQR, 98.5-445.0 days). Among 232 patients with a bleed-
ing event, 41 deaths (17.7%) occurred, whereas among 11 416
patients without a bleeding event, 181 deaths (1.6%) occurred
(P < .001). Of deaths after a bleeding event, 22 (53.7%) were
attributable to cardiovascular causes (9 related to MI, ST, or
ischemic stroke). The frequency of death after a moderate
bleeding event was 9.7% and after a severe bleeding event was
32.5% (Figure 1). The cumulative incidence of death after a

bleeding event was 0.3% (0.1% with moderate and 0.2% with
severe bleeding). Results according to BARC definitions are
summarized in eTable 2 in the Supplement. Of 47 patients with
ICH, 14 (29.8%) died, with a cumulative incidence of death af-
ter an ICH of 0.1%. Death after moderate or severe bleeding oc-
curred predominantly within 1 month of the event (Figure 2),
with a median survival time of 16.0 days (IQR, 3.0-81.0 days).
Three of the 235 bleeding events were immediately fatal.
The unadjusted annualized mortality rate after a moder-
ate or severe bleeding event was 21.5 (95% CI, 15.4-29.1) per
100 person-years. Controlling for demographic characteris-
tics, comorbid conditions, and procedural factors, a bleeding
event was associated with an 18.1-fold (95% CI, 12.6-26.0) in-
creasedhazardfordeathcomparedwiththeabsenceofableed-
ing event. There was a greater hazard of death after severe
bleeding events (HR, 36.3; 95% CI, 23.3-56.6) compared with
moderate (HR, 8.0; 95% CI, 4.7-13.7) bleeding events. Similar
results were obtained when applying BARC bleeding defini-
tions (Table 3). Risks of death within the first 30 days after a
bleeding event and more than 30 days after the event are sum-
marized in eTable 1 in the Supplement.
Incidence and Mortality Risk Among Patients
With Multiple Ischemic or Bleeding Events
Among randomized patients, 101 (0.9%) had multiple events,
whereas 558 (4.8%) had a single event. Of those with mul-
tipleevents,41(0.4%)hadmorethan1ischemicevent,9(0.1%)
hadmorethan1bleedingevent,and51(0.4%)experiencedboth
ischemic and bleeding events. Among patients with both
events, 24 (47.1%) had an ischemic event first, 14 (27.4%) had
a bleeding event first, and 13 (25.5%) had both ischemic and
bleeding events at the time of presentation. Patients with mul-
tiple events had a mortality rate of 23.8% compared with 9.3%
among those with a single event (P < .01). Mortality among pa-
tientswithmorethan1ischemiceventwas12.2%,amongthose
with more than 1 bleeding event was 22.2%, and among those
with both ischemic and bleeding events was 33.3%.
Discussion
This post hoc analysis of randomized patients from the DAPT
Study is the largest to date to examine the incidence and
prognosis of very late ischemic and bleeding events after
coronary stenting. From this analysis, we note the following
observations. Among treatment-adherent patients who were
event free for 1 year after coronary stenting, ischemic and
bleeding events occurring between 12 and 33 months were
associated with high risk of mortality. Ischemic events were
more common than bleeding events, and death after either
category of event accounted for an elevated mortality risk
(27.2 deaths for ischemic events and 21.5 deaths for bleeding
events per 100 person-years of follow-up, respectively).
The risk of death after MI not related to ST was sustained
throughout follow-up, whereas the mortality risk after bleed-
ing events was greatest within 30 days of the event. A minor-
ity of randomized patients (0.9%) experienced more than
1 ischemic or bleeding event, and mortality was increased
among patients with multiple events compared with a single
event (23.8% vs 9.3%). The most common cause of death
after an ischemic event or a bleeding event was cardiovascu-
lar. Overall, the cumulative incidence of death after an ische-
mic event was 0.5%, and the cumulative incidence of death
after a bleeding event was 0.3%.

subsequent risk of death. The number of each event represents the number of
patients experiencing the event. Multiple types of events could be experienced
by the same patient. For patients with more than one of the same type of event,
only the earliest event contributed to the analysis. Other cardiovascular deaths
were defined as any cardiovascular death not preceded by a myocardial
infarction (MI), stent thrombosis (ST), or ischemic stroke. These events
primarily consisted of sudden cardiac deaths (n = 40), heart failure–related
deaths (n = 9), and fatal ventricular arrhythmias (n = 4). GUSTO indicates

This study broadens our understanding of the clinical ef-
fect of ischemic and bleeding events by focusing on adjudi-
cated events occurring beyond 1 year after coronary stenting.
While a diverse group of patients was enrolled in the DAPT
Study,21 including patients with or without MI at the time of
the index procedure,22 randomization was limited to those pa-
tients who were treatment adherent and event free during the
first year of follow-up. Despite this restriction, it is notewor-
thy that ischemic and bleeding events occurring beyond 1 year
were associated with substantial mortality risk.
We observed a ratio of ischemic events to bleeding events
of 2.1:1 and a ratio of MIs to bleeding events of 1.3:1. These find-
ings are similar to the ratio of events that occurred among this
study population in the first 12 months after enrollment in the
DAPT Study.8 Other studies7,11 examining late events after MI
or PCI have found comparable ratios of cardiovascular events
to bleeding events, whereas analyses that included earlier
events have demonstrated higher rates of bleeding.13 Prior
analyseshavealsodemonstratedthatcardiovascularandbleed-
ing events may differ depending on the timing of initiation of
dual antiplatelet therapy.23
In our analysis, very late ischemic events and very late
bleeding events were associated with high hazards of mortal-
ity, even after adjusting for measured patient factors. Signifi-
cant mortality risks have been similarly observed for events
occurringearlierafterPCI.11-13,24,25Moderatebleeding,themost
frequent bleeding event in the present study, was associated
with a risk of mortality similar to that of MI as seen in prior
analyses11,25andhadmortalityriskscomparabletothoseevents
occurring around the time of the procedure10 and within the
first year after PCI.12 Conversely, severe (including fatal) bleed-
ing occurred less commonly herein but was associated with a
grave risk of death. Patients infrequently experienced ICH
(0.4%), and rates of events occurred equally between random-
ized groups.
Of all ischemic events, MI not related to ST occurred most
commonly and was associated with a sustained risk of death
throughout the study period. This result differed from bleed-
ing events, which were primarily followed by death within 1
month. These temporal relationships are the inverse of those
seen in a prior analysis that involved earlier events after acute
coronary syndromes.26 We hypothesize that these disparate

findings are largely because of differing types of events. Bleed-
ing events in the present analysis were mainly nonprocedure-
related spontaneous bleeds, which have been associated with
higher short-term mortality compared with procedure-
related bleeding.24 Spontaneous MIs unrelated to the stented
artery constituted most ischemic events in our study rather
thanperiproceduralorST-relatedMIs.UnlikespontaneousMIs,
ST was associated with immediate mortality risk. The sus-
tained risk associated with spontaneous MI may occur via the
development of risk factors for future mortality, such as left
ventricular dysfunction and arrhythmias,11 risks expected to
persist beyond the time frame of the present study.
Fewpatientshadbothischemicandbleedingevents,which
highlights the need to adapt dual antiplatelet therapy dura-
tion according to individual patient characteristics. A predic-
tion rule for patient benefit and harm has been developed from
the present study population27 and may be useful in optimiz-
ing care for individual patients.28
Strengths and Limitations
This analysis has several strengths. It included patients with
a range of comorbidities and procedural complexity. In addi-
tion, all events and outcomes were independently adjudi-
cated. However, the results must also be interpreted in the
context of the study design. Patients with a history of signifi-
cant bleeding or treated with oral anticoagulation were
excluded. While ischemic events were more common than
bleeding events in the first year as reasons for exclusion
from randomization, our analysis is only relevant to deter-
mining the prognosis after late events occurring among
treatment-adherent patients who have survived event free
in the first 12 months after coronary stenting. Fortunately,
most patients undergoing PCI have excellent outcomes,
without ischemic or bleeding events, recurrent procedures,
or treatment nonadherence during the first year of
follow-up.29 In addition, the incidences of ischemic and
bleeding events depend on the definitions used. We found
similar risks of mortality whether using GUSTO19 or BARC20
definitions for bleeding events in that more severe events
were associated with higher mortality and less severe events
were associated with less subsequent mortality. We
excluded cardiovascular deaths not adjudicated to be pre-
ceded by MI, ST, or ischemic stroke and, in doing so,
excluded 40 sudden cardiac deaths from classification as
ischemic events in this study. While it is possible that many
of these events were related to ischemia in the absence of
documented MI or ST, their exclusion provides a conserva-
tive estimate of the proportion and number of ischemic
events.
Conclusions
Among patients who survived to 12 months after coronary
stenting event free, ischemic events were more frequent than
bleeding events, yet both events were associated with high risk
of mortality. The risk of death after very late MIs was sus-
tained, whereas death after bleeding events primarily oc-
curred within 30 days. These findings emphasize the need to
adapttherapytoindividualpatientcharacteristicstoavoidvery
late ischemic and bleeding events among patients after coro-
nary stenting.
