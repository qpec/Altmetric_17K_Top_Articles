SUMMARY
Hippocampal neurons activated during encoding
drive the recall of contextual fear memory. Little is
known about how such ensembles emerge during
acquisition and eventually form the cellular engram.
Manipulating the activity of granule cells (GCs) of
the dentate gyrus (DG), we reveal a mechanism of
lateral inhibition that modulates the size of the
cellular engram. GCs engage somatostatin-positive
interneurons that inhibit the dendrites of surrounding
GCs. Our findings reveal a microcircuit within the DG
that controls the size of the cellular engram and the
stability of contextual fear memory.
INTRODUCTION
Memory acquisition starts when exploration of a new environ-
ment drives synaptic activity in a small fraction of hippocampal
neurons, triggering synaptic plasticity mechanisms that are
believed to underlie long-term storage of memory (Martin et al.,
2000; Malenka and Bear, 2004; Matsuzaki et al., 2004). Although
synaptic plasticity occurring during memory formation has been
extensively investigated in many brain areas (Whitlock et al.,
2006; Maren and Quirk, 2004; Frankland et al., 2001; Nabavi
et al., 2014), it remains unknown how memory is assigned to
selected populations of neurons. How neuronal ensembles are
chosen to encode a particular memory has implications for sta-
bility and specificity of memory and ultimately determines the
storage capacity of neuronal networks (Olshausen and Field,
2004).
Excitatory neurons in the mouse dentate gyrus (DG) are essen-
tial for memory formation and retrieval (Pierson et al., 2015;
Kheirbek et al., 2013). The immediate early gene cFos has widely
been used as a marker for neuronal activity in this brain region
(Smeyne et al., 1992; Reijmers et al., 2007; Morgan and Curran,
1991) since its rapid and transient upregulation correlates with
experience driven synaptic activity. New environment explora-
tion induces the formation of an active neuronal ensemble
defined by cFos expression in a distinct fraction of granule cells
(GCs) (Deng et al., 2013; Tashiro et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2012).
When associated with an aversive stimulus such as in fear con-
ditioning paradigms, retrieval of the contextual memory requires
the reactivation of the cFos-expressing ensemble of neurons
(Tayler et al., 2013). As context information is permanently
stored, the active neuronal ensemble that emerged during the
exploration becomes both necessary and sufficient for the
mnemonic representation of the context (Ramirez et al., 2013;
Tanaka et al., 2014; Denny et al., 2014) and is then referred to
as the cellular engram.
The mechanisms ruling how fear memory is assigned to
excitatory neurons in the amygdala involve the activity of the
transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein
(CREB) that modulates cellular excitability ultimately governing
memory allocation (Han et al., 2007; Yiu et al., 2014). Although
much evidence has identified cell autonomous mechanisms
that regulate the selection of neuronal ensembles (Rogerson
et al., 2014), network mechanisms may also contribute to the for-
mation of the cellular engram. Do active ensembles of neurons
interact with silent neurons during memory acquisition? What
factors limit the size of the engram? What are the consequences
of this restricted recruitment for memory stability?
The activity of hippocampal excitatory projection neurons is
controlled by a diverse population of inhibitory interneurons
(INs) (Markram et al., 2004). For example, parvalbumin (PV)-ex-
pressing inhibitory cells target soma and axon initial segment
and thus control the action potential output of excitatory cells
(Freund and Katona, 2007). In contrast, somatostatin (SST)-ex-
pressing INs target dendrites and filter synaptic input to principal
cells (Miles et al., 1996; Maccaferri, 2005). Recent work has pro-
posed a role of inhibition in the neuronal computations per-
formed in the hippocampus during fear memory formation
(Lovett-Barron et al., 2014). Dendritic- and somatic-targeting
INs are ideally situated to control synaptic activity flow in the hip-
pocampal network (Mendez and Bacci, 2011), yet whether they
play a role in determining the cellular engram and by extension in
memory formation, remains elusive.
Here we investigate network mechanisms that govern the for-
mation of the cellular engram and test its effects on memory
stability. We find that memory is assigned to hippocampal GC
populations by an activity-dependent process that regulates
the size of the cellular engram and the stability of the associated
memory. Active neurons engage local INs and inhibit surround-
ing projection neurons excluding them from the engram. Alto-
gether, our results reveal a role of specific inhibitory circuits in
the network plasticity responsible for contextual fear memory.

 RESULTS
Neuronal Activity during Spatial Exploration Determines
the Active Ensemble
In order to test if neuronal activity affects the formation of the
cellular engram, we bi-directionally controlled the activity of a
random population of GCs in mice exploring a new environment.
We then quantified the size and distribution of the active
neuronal ensemble using cFos.
We unilaterally infected the DG with adeno-associated viruses
(AAVs) expressing the recombinase Cre under the control of
Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) promoter
and a Cre-dependent Channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) and implanted
a fiber optic cannula (see Experimental Procedures section). The
use of the viral mix with the CaMKII promoter led to selective
expression of ChR2 in a small fraction of dorsal DG excitatory
cells (12.8% ± 1.3% of GCs at –2.0 mm from bregma, n = 12,
Figures S1A and S1B) whose firing rate was reliable controlled
by blue light (Figure S1C). Mice performed spatial exploration
(SE) for 15 min in the presence (SE-Stimulated) or absence
(SE-Control) of optogenetic stimulation (10 Hz pulses of
470 nm light during the entire duration of the exploratory phase).
When mice were killed and perfused 45 min later (Figure 1A),
cFos+ neurons were more abundant in both SE groups
compared to animals that remained in their home cage for the
whole duration of the experiment (F(2,10) = 64.95, p < 0.001, Fig-
ures 1B and 1C), confirming the induction of experience-depen-
dent neuronal ensembles by SE. In addition, those mice that
received optogenetic stimulation had a significantly higher num-
ber of cFos+ GCs compared to unstimulated mice (Home cage
3 ± 2; SE-Control 27 ± 3; SE-Stimulated 39 ± 1 cFos+ cells/field,
p < 0.01, Figures 1B and 1C). Without concomitant laser stimu-
lation, most cFos+ neurons were ChR2� (Figure 1D, white
bar), indicating a low degree of overlap between the two ensem-
bles. In contrast, optogenetic stimulation during SE strongly
enhanced cFos expression in ChR2+ GCs (F(3,14) = 93.56, p <
0.001, Figure 1D, striped bars). Importantly, this increase in the
proportion of cFos+ neurons was at the expense of the cFos+
in ChR2� GCs that was reduced by optogenetic stimulation
(Control 84% ± 3%, Stimulated 20% ± 5% of ChR2�/cFos+,
p < 0.001). These results demonstrate that optogenetically acti-
vated neurons add to the active neuronal ensemble while sup-
pressing the recruitment of non-activated neighboring neurons.
We next silenced a fraction of GCs by unilateral stereotaxic in-
jections of AAVs expressing the inhibitory designer receptor
exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD) hM4D under
the CamKII promoter. Clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) application
silenced GCs expressing hM4D receptor hyperpolarizing the
membrane by 7.9 ± 1.6 mV (Figures S1D and S1E). Mice ex-
pressing hM4D receptor in GCs (25.7% ± 1.8% of GCs
at –2.0 mm from bregma, n = 7, Figure S1D) received an intra-
peritoneal (i.p.) injection of CNO (2 mg/kg) or saline 1 hr before
being placed in the new environment. After 1 hr of SE, mice
were killed and perfused and brains processed for cFos quanti-
fication (Figure 1E). As in the previous experiments, SE increased
the number cFos+ neurons in the GC layer of the DG compared
with home cage animals (F(2,12) = 167.2, p < 0.001, Figures 1F
and 1G) and even more so in mice where a fraction of GCs
were silenced (Home cage 3 ± 2; SE-Control 31 ± 1; SE-Silenced
50 ± 2 cFos+ cells/field, p < 0.001, Figure 1G). Despite this in-
crease in absolute number of cFos+ neurons, the ratio of cells
simultaneously expressing cFos and hM4D decreased (Figures
1F and 1H, striped bars, F(3,18) = 79.77, p < 0.001). These results
indicate that silencing neuronal activity in a random set of GCs
again increases the size of the active neuronal ensemble, but
now by recruiting preferentially non-inactivated hM4D� neu-
rons. Altogether, these results show that altering the activity of
a random set of neurons during SE increases the active neuronal
ensemble size, either because cells are directly stimulated or
because neighboring cells are silenced.
Manipulation of the Active Neuronal Ensemble Affects
Contextual Fear Memory
We
next determined if
manipulating
the active
neuronal
ensemble size is behaviorally relevant by testing for an effect
on contextual fear memory and cellular engram activation.
Training for this memory test requires SE of a new context that
is subsequently associated with an aversive stimulus (McHugh
and Tonegawa, 2007). We bilaterally injected and cannulated
mice for optogenetic activation of a random fraction of GCs dur-
ing the training session of the contextual fear conditioning proto-
col (Figure 2A, upper pannel). During recall, driven exclusively by
contextual cues, mice that were stimulated during training
showed much reduced freezing behavior compared with control
mice (F(1,8) = 35.02, p < 0.001, Figure 2B). Optogenetic stimula-
tion of GCs did not affect exploratory activity (Control 2.0 ±
0.12 m, Stimulation 1.75 ± 0.14 m, p = 0.28, n = 4 and 8, Fig-
ure S2A), short-term memory, or shock reactivity (Figures S2B
and S2C), and both groups spent equal time in freezing behavior
during the training session (p = 0.99, Figure 2B). Moreover, opto-
genetic stimulation in one context did not affect fear conditioning
in another one (Figure S2D). These results suggest that optoge-
netic activation of GCs during training disrupts long-term mem-
ory performance.
To test if memory deficits arise from impaired activation of the
cellular engram, we compared the size of the cFos+ ensemble
induced after 1 week recall and after the training session.
Context-dependent recall 1 week after training induced similar
number of cFos+ GCs compared to those detected immediately
after training (Training 10 ± 2, Recall, control 11 ± 2, Figure 2C),
suggesting comparable size of the acquisition active neuronal
ensemble and recall cellular engram. In contrast, mice optoge-
netically stimulated during training had lower number of cFos+
GCs after the 1 week recall session (Recall, stimulated 5 ± 2
cells/field, p < 0.05, Figure 2C). Consistent with the absence of
optogenetic stimulation of GCs activity during recall, no differ-
ence was observed in the number of ChR2+/cFos+ double
stained GCs (Figure S2E) showing the lack of bias toward
ChR2+ GC activation during context-dependent recall. These
observations indicate that optogenetic stimulation of a random
population of GCs during training impairs long-term memory
recall by making contextual cues unable to drive cellular engram
activation.
Is this memory trace irreversibly lost? To answer this question,
we injected, cannulated, and trained as above another group of
mice. However, in this case we performed on/off epochs of

 additional optogenetic stimulation of GCs during the 1 week
recall session (Figure 2A, lower pannel). Laser-mediated neu-
ronal stimulation restored freezing behavior in mice that had
received optogenetic stimulation of GCs also during training
(Stimulated, F(1,7) = 120.10, p < 0.001, Figure 2E), although to
slightly lower levels (Figure S2F). Light stimulation during recall
had no effect in mice with unaltered neuronal activity during
training (Control, F(1,3) = 11.22, p < 0.05, Figure 2D). These re-
sults suggest that optogenetic stimulation of a fraction of GCs
during training disrupts natural memory but creates an artificial
cellular engram by directing memory to activated neurons.
We next bilaterally silenced a fraction of excitatory neurons in
the DG by injecting mice with AAV-CamKII-hM4D in the DG.
5 weeks later, mice received i.p. injections of saline (Control) or

(A) Mice expressing ChR2 in a fraction of GCs were placed in a novel cage with (Stimulated) or without (Control) optogenetic activation of a sparse population of

 CNO (Silenced) 1 hr before training in a contextual fear condition-
ing chamber in order to silence a fraction of GCs exclusively
during memory acquisition (Figure 3A). In the recall sessions per-
formed 1 day and 1 week later, mice with silenced neurons dur-
ing training showed increased freezing behavior (F(1,18) = 9.52,
p < 0.01, Figure 3B).
CNO had no effect on freezing in uninfected mice (F(1,6) =
0.08, p = 0.78, Figure S3A). In addition, chemogenetic inactiva-
tion of a fraction of GCs did not induce alteration in anxiety-
related behaviors, such as the time spent in the open arms
of the elevated plus maze (Figure S3B) and freezing levels
during the training session (Figure 3B). Enhanced memory in
mice with a silenced fraction of GCs at the time of training
led to a larger proportion of cFos+ cells (p < 0.05, Figure 3C)
but a decreased ratio of hM4D+/cFos+ double stained cells
after recall session at 1 week (F(3,16) = 71.83, p < 0.001 Fig-
ure 3D). These experiments indicate that alterations of GC
activity during training cause the artificial recruitment of
behaviorally relevant neurons that contribute to contextual
fear memory stability. Memory recall is driven by context-
dependent neuronal activity when neurons were silenced
during training but requires optogenetic stimulation of the
engram in mice stimulated during training (see model on Fig-
ures S3C–S3E).
Interneurons Are Activated during SE
Our data suggest that the population of active GCs, which are re-
cruited during memory formation, may suppress GCs in their
vicinity (Figure S3F). The inhibitory effect of this interaction
strongly suggests the involvement of GABAergic INs in a di-syn-
aptic network. According to this idea, silencing the activity of DG
GABA neurons using hM4D receptors during SE increased the
size of the active ensemble (Figure S3G). In order to identify
the specific IN subtype activated during SE, we injected a virally
encoded reporter of synaptic activity based on the promoter
region of the Arg3.1/Arc gene (AAV-SARE-GFP) in the DG of
mice (Figures S4A and S4B) (Kawashima et al., 2009). Compara-
ble induction of endogenous Arg3.1/Arc protein was observed
after brief periods of optogenetic-induced activity in SST and
PV INs, validating the use of AAV-SARE-GFP to unbiasedly
compare neuronal activity in different IN types (Figure S4C).
1 hr after SE, mice were perfused and the expression of the syn-
aptic activity reporter GFP was assessed in GCs, PV+, and SST+
INs (Figure S4D). As expected, we found a consistent fraction of
neurons in the GC layer expressing the synaptic activity reporter
GFP (GC 7% ± 2% of infected neurons, n = 4, Figure 4A). For
GABAergic INs, only a small percentage of PV+ neurons showed
increased levels of GFP (3% ± 2% of PV+ neurons, n = 4, Fig-
ure 4A) while a high proportion of SST+ cells expressed high
levels of GFP (33% ± 7% of SST+ neurons, n = 4, Kruskal-Wallis
test, p < 0.01, Figure 4A).
SST+ inhibitory neurons respond to the increase in synaptic
activity induced by SE. Dendrites of SST+ INs are confined
in the hilus where mossy axons from GCs form ‘‘en passant’’
synapses (Acsa
´ dy et al., 1998). In order to test if GCs
activate microcircuits formed by SST+ INs, we optogeneti-
cally stimulated a fraction of GCs during SE and analyzed
cFos expression in SST+ cells. Most SST+ INs were cFos+
in stimulated mice in contrast with the low fraction in con-
trol mice (Control 14 ± 3, Stimulated 77% ± 5% of SST+

Trace
(A) Mice were trained in the fear conditioning set up
with (Stimulated, blue bars) or without (Control,

population of GCs. Mice were tested in the same
context 1 day and 1 week after without opto-
genetic stimulation (top, [B] and [C], contextual

minute, total test duration 3 min, bottom, [D] and

(C) Analysis of cFos expression GCs after the

optogentic stimulation of GCs activity, recall of
memory by contextual cues leads to a decreased

 population, p < 0.001, Figure 4B). This result suggests that
SST+ INs are efficiently activated by sparse populations of
GCs in the DG.
Chemogenetic effectors were then used to asses if perturbing
the activity of SST+ INs had an effect on cFos expression in this
IN population. SST-Cre mice performed 1 hr of SE while the ac-
tivity of SST+ INs was increased or decreased by CNO-mediated
activation of DREADD receptors expressed exclusively in DG
SST+ INs (Figures S5A and S5B). High levels SST+ IN activity
(Stimulated, hM3D) increased the expression of cFos in this IN
population while decreased activity (Silenced, hM4D) lowered
the proportion of cFos+ SST+ INs (Control 26 ± 6, Silenced
9 ± 4, Stimulated 47% ± 9% of SST+ neurons, F(2,17) = 6.75,
p < 0.01, Figure 4C, left graph). Conversely, the number of
cFos+ GCs was increased by SST+ IN silencing and decreased
in mice with stimulated SST+ neurons (F(2,17) = 39.33, p < 0.01,
Figure 4C, right graph). These results suggest that SST+neuronal
activity bidirectionally controls gene expression and neuronal
ensemble size.
SST+ INs Provide Inhibition to GCs Dendrites
We next characterized the connectivity of GCs in acute hippo-
campal
slice
preparations
using
patch-clamp
recordings.
Optogenetic stimulation of a sparse population of ChR2+ GCs
produced a small glutamatergic response in ChR2� GCs, in
line with weak recurrent excitatory connectivity. In contrast,
light stimulation of ChR2+ GCs produced a large amplitude
GABAergic response in the same neurons, suggesting the
recruitment of INs (Mean amplitude GABA 163 ± 18, Glu
10 ± 3 pA, Figure 5A). The GABAergic response was abolished
by the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX) (1 mM) and
the GABAA receptor antagonist SR 95531 (GBZ) (10 mM) and
largely reduced by the wide-spectrum glutamate receptor
blocker Kynurenic acid (Kyn) (6 mM, F(4,32) = 16.70, p < 0.001,
Figures 5B and 5C). These results suggest that optogenetic stim-
ulation of GCs activates downstream GABAergic neurons, which
in turn inhibit neighboring GCs.
We next wanted to establish the origin of this form of lateral
inhibition. We optogenetically stimulated GCs to induce poly-
synaptic GABAergic responses (Lateral inhibition, CamKII) or
PV+ or SST+ INs to elicit mono-synaptic inhibition from periso-
matic or dendrite targeting INs, respectively (Figure S5C). In all
three conditions, stimulation produced time-locked GABAergic
responses of similar amplitude in the recorded ChR2� GC (PV
181 ± 55, SST 194 ± 44, CamKII 163 ± 18 pA; F(2,28) = 0.24,
p = 0.78, Figure 5D). However, the kinetic of the responses
was different. GABAergic currents originating in PV+ and
SST+ INs had a shorter delay than those recorded after stimula-
tion of GCs (PV 5.6 ± 0.5, SST 5.8 ± 0.3, CamKII 7.8 ± 0.5 ms;
F(2,28) = 6.72, p < 0.01, Figure 5D), accordingly with the poly-
synaptic nature of the latter. The rise time of PV+ GABAergic
current was shorter while rise slope was more than 2-fold higher
when compared with SST+ currents (Rise time: PV 1.0 ± 0.1,
SST 4.8 ± 0.5 ms; rise slope: PV 77.6 ± 14.3, SST 30.4 ±
10.2 pA/ms, Figure 5D), consistent with large electrotonic
filtering of dendrite (SST) but not somatic (PV) originated cur-
rents. GABAergic responses resulting from stimulation of excit-
atory cells (CamKII) showed slower rise times compared with
currents arising from PV+ INs but similar to those from SST+
INs (Rise time CamKII 6.0 ± 0.7 ms, rise slope CamKII 23.1 ±
4.4pA/ms; Kruskal-Wallis test, rise time p < 0.001, rise slope
p < 0.01, Figure 5D). These results suggest that lateral inhibition
elicited by optogenetic activation of GCs arises from SST+
dendrite targeting INs.

 SST+ INs Regulate Memory Strength and Distribution
We next tested whether SST+ IN activity control experience-
dependent ensemble size and memory formation by testing for
an effect in contextual fear memory and cellular engram activa-
tion. Chemogenetic modulation of SST+ IN activity during the
training session had no effect on freezing behavior (Figures 6A
and 6B, p > 0.99). In contrast, mice where SST+ INs were
silenced during training showed enhanced freezing behavior
during recall 1 day and 1 week later (Figure 6B, p < 0.01, black
bars). Conversely, when activity in SST+ INs was increased dur-
ing training, freezing during recall was lower than in control mice
during the 1 week test session (F(2,35) = 19.63, p < 0.001, Fig-
ure 6B, gray bars).
Bidirectional modulation of behavior by SST+ IN activity was
reflected by the number of cFos+ GCs detected after the last
recall session. Mice with silenced SST+ INs showed a larger

ulation. The graph shows quantitative analysis of the fraction of GCs (asterisks in images), PV+ (left), SST+ INs (right) that are positive for the synaptic activity

cFos expression in this IN population (left graph). Conversely, the number of cFos+ GCs after 1 hr SE was higher in mice with silenced SST+ INs (hM4D) but was
reduced in mice with increased SST+ IN activity (hM3D, right graph), ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, one-way ANOVA, Bonferroni post hoc test, 9, 5, 6 mice per group.

 population of cFos+ GCs while increased SST+ IN activity at the
time of training reduced the number of cFos+ GCs when
compared to control mice (F(2,30) = 19.93, p < 0.001, Figures
6C and S6E).
We performed similar experiments in PV-Cre mice to test the
role of PV+ IN activity in memory formation. Chemogenetic acti-
vation of hM3D expressing PV+ INs during SE increased the frac-
tion of these neurons expressing cFos (Control 25 ± 10, Active
69% ± 6% of PV+ neurons, p < 0.01, Figure S5E) and caused sig-
nificant membrane depolarization and spiking activity (Fig-
ure S5D), suggesting effective modulation of neuronal activity
in this IN population. However, increased PV+ IN activity during
training in the contextual fear memory test resulted in no differ-
ence in the time spent in freezing behavior in any of the recall
sessions (1 day, 1 week, F(1,9) = 1.40, p = 0.27; Figure 6E).
Similar number of cFos+ neurons was counted in the GC layer
after the last recall session in both groups (p = 0.27, Figure 6F).
In line with these results, optogenetic activation of PV+ neurons
during training did not alter freezing levels during test sessions
(F(1,12)<0.01 p = 0.99, Figure S6A) or the number of cFos+
GCs after SE (Figurse S6B and S6C). These results suggest
that SST+ but not PV+ IN activity during training bidirectionally
modulates long-term memory and the size of cellular engram.
The effect of SST+ IN activity in freezing behavior after condi-
tioning could reflect an influence of this IN type on fear
generalization. We addressed this question by testing whether
hM4D-mediated inactivation of this IN type during training
affects freezing behavior in a different context than the one
used for training. Although inactivation of SST+ INs increased
freezing levels during subsequent exposition to fear conditioning
chamber, it did not affect fear response when mice were
exposed to a different unrelated context (Figure S6D). Chemoge-
netic modulation of SST+ IN activity did not alter performance of
mice in the elevated plus maze, excluding a role of anxiety like
behavior in the increased freezing response observed in mice
with decreased SST activity (Figure S6D). These results show
that enhanced memory performance upon SST+ INs inactivation
during training is specific for the training context and suggest
that SST+ INs do not influence fear generalization.
DISCUSSION
Our study identifies lateral inhibition between GCs as a mecha-
nism that constrains the ensemble of activated neurons during
SE of a new environment. In contextual fear paradigm, the lateral
inhibition determines the size of the cellular engram and the sta-
bility of the memory trace.
Several factors may limit the size of the active neuronal en-
sembles that emerge in the DG during SE. First, the number of
GCs is several fold higher than the number of upstream excit-
atory neurons in the entorhinal cortex (Schmidt et al., 2012). Sec-
ond, GCs’ dendrites strongly attenuate synaptic inputs so that
the cell fires only when many inputs are concomitantly active
(Krueppel et al., 2011). In addition, our results now reveal the ex-
istence of lateral inhibition among GCs. This inhibitory interaction
maintains the low level of neuronal excitation in cells not imme-
diately active during SE that is typically required for DG function
(Treves and Rolls, 1994).
As memory formation progresses, naturally formed neuronal
ensembles acquire engram properties (i.e., they become neces-
sary and sufficient to evoke specific memories) (Tanaka et al.,
2014; Denny et al., 2014). Previous studies have manipulated
the memory trace associated with naturally formed neuronal en-
sembles (Han et al., 2009; Ramirez et al., 2013; Cowansage
et al., 2014). Here, we succeed to assign fear memory to a
neuronal ensemble that was artificially generated in the hippo-
campus without specific context representation. Optogenetic
stimulation of this subset of neurons at the time of training

 determines the allocation of an artificial memory trace to the
active fraction of neurons. However, changes in reactivation of
the ensembles due to rapid uncoupling of the context and the
fear response by the non-naturalistic stimulation pattern may
cause memory extinction and reduced optogenetic memory
retrieval (Figure S2F).

At the same time, the active ensemble
inhibits the recruitment of neighboring
cells avoiding retrieval of memory by nat-
ural cues and providing specificity to the
artificial cellular engram. How is this
achieved? Since the sizes of both the
ChR2-tagged population of GCs (�13%)
and the fraction of GCs receiving strong synaptic input from
the EC (�8% of GC express cFos+ after SE) are small, the
chances for a neuron to belong simultaneously to both pools
(that would allow association of sensory information with the
ChR2 induced activity) are negligible. Optogenetic activation of
GCs abolishes the formation of an ensemble that could guide

 recall by natural cues since cFos staining is almost absent in
ChR2� GCs (Figures 1D and S2E). Context information would
be then represented exclusively by ChR2+ GCs whose activity,
transmitted to downstream brain regions (for example, amyg-
dala), would be associated with information from the uncondi-
tioned stimulus. On the other hand, optogenetic activation of
GCs may cause homeostatic reductions of neuronal activity
(Goold and Nicoll, 2010) that may decrease reactivation of the
ChR2+ ensemble by context-dependent inputs, preventing nat-
ural recall.
Our results suggest a competitive distribution of the memory
trace among hippocampal neurons, akin to other brain regions
(Han et al., 2007). However, our data also indicate that acute
modulation of neuronal activity during training bidirectionally af-
fects the size of the cellular engram through a network mecha-
nism. Manipulations that increase the number of GCs recruited
in the active ensemble led to a larger size of the cellular engram
and increased performance in memory tests while decreasing
the size of the active ensemble had the opposite effect (Fig-
ure S6E). During SE, active neurons inhibit the recruitment of
neighboring cells confining to the engram neurons that receive
strong synaptic input from multiple entorhinal afferents. Interest-
ingly, the mechanisms that govern the recruitment of neurons
during memory acquisition resemble those engaged during
memory recall, suggesting a common form of long-term plas-
ticity of the network that would be implemented during engram
formation.
The lateral inhibition between neighboring GCs is di-synaptic,
mediated by GABAA transmission, and observed in almost all
GCs. Among GABAergic INs in the DG, SST+ cells, which target
dendrites of neighboring CGs, constitute the link between two
excitatory neurons. Dendritic lateral inhibition has also been
observed in the cerebral cortex (Kapfer et al., 2007; Silberberg
and Markram, 2007) where it is also mediated by SST+ INs
that correlate pyramidal neuron activity (Berger et al., 2010) to
silence excitatory transmission (Urban-Ciecko et al., 2015).
SST+ INs projecting to dendrites fire at high rates during move-
ment (Katona et al., 2014), which may help to maintain low levels
of DG activity and make manipulations aimed to increase their
activity less effective and require longer time to become evident
(Figure 6B). Dendrite GABAergic synapses can shunt excitatory
currents generated by excitatory afferents allowing SST+ INs to
modulate synaptic plasticity, intracellular signaling, and gene
expression required for memory formation (Chiu et al., 2013;
Chalifoux and Carter, 2010).
Although acute modulation of hippocampal PV+ INs during
training does not prevent fear memory formation (Lovett-Barron
et al., 2014), PV+ INs may also contribute to information storage
by adapting network plasticity (and subsequent memory forma-
tion) to previous experience (Donato et al., 2013). Our study thus
suggests that SST+ INs play a role in memory analogous to the
sharpening of orientation tuning in the visual cortex (Wilson
et al., 2012). It is important to notice that the limited temporal res-
olution of chemogenetics does not allow for exclusion of a role
for SST+ INs in fear memory formation that goes beyond the
training phase (for example, during memory consolidation). In
addition, neuronal activity regulates cFos levels in SST+ INs.
Thus, activity-dependent modulation of gene expression may
control memory-related plasticity also in SST+ INs by altering
input and output connectivity in this IN type (Spiegel et al., 2014).
Beyond physiology, altered lateral inhibition may be associ-
ated with several brain diseases. Accumulating evidence sup-
ports the involvement of abnormalities of GABAergic circuits in
schizophrenia (Lewis et al., 2005; Marı
´n, 2012), epilepsy (Cossart
et al., 2001), and Alzheimer disease (Verret et al., 2012). Our find-
ings may set the stage for future investigations with the goal to
understand the molecular and cellular basis for the associated
memory deficits and eventually propose rational therapies.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Animals
Group housed adult (12–15 weeks) wild-type, SST-Cre (Ssttm2.1(cre)Zjh/J,
RRID:MGI_4838419),
and
PV-Cre
(Pvalb
tm1(cre)Arbr/J,
RRID:IMSR_
JAX:017320) mice maintained in a 12 hr light/dark cycle and with unlimited ac-
cess to food were used for the study. All mice lines were kept in a C57BL/6J
genetic background. Experiments were performed according to protocols
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University
of Geneva and the Geneva Veterinary office.
Viruses
AAVs used in this study were produced by the University of North Carolina
and University of Pennsylvania vector cores. AAV-EF1a-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-
mCherry,
AAV-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry,
AAV-hSyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-
mCherry, and AAV-CaMKIIa-HA-hM4D(Gi)-IRES-mCitrine constructs were
used with serotype 5 AVVs. In order to obtain sparse optogenetic activation
of DG excitatory cells, diluted (1:5,000) AAV-CamKII0.4-Cre (serotype 1) was
coinjected with AAV-EF1a-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-mCherry. AAV-SARE-GFP
was constructed by subcloning the EcoRI-KpnI fragment of the CSIV-FII-
PGK-FP635-SARE-ArcMin-d2EGFP vector (courtesy of H. Bito, University of
Tokyo) in an emptied AAV vector backbone. The resulting AAV (serotype 2) en-
codes a bidirectional expression cassette that expresses a red fluorescent
protein (TurboFP635) under the control of the constitutive promoter from
mouse PGK and a destabilized version of the GFP (d2EGFP) under the control
of a synaptic activity responsive promoter (SARE).
Surgery
Analgesic treatment (paracetamol 0.2 g/kg) was administered for 2 days
around surgery. Anesthesia was induced at 5% and maintained at 1.5%–
2.0% isoflurane (w/v) (Baxter AG). Mice were placed in a stereotaxic frame
(Angle One), and craniotomies were performed using stereotaxic coordinates
adapted from a mouse brain atlas to target the dorsal DG: –2.2 anterior–
posterior; ± 1.4 medial–lateral; –1.9 dorsal–ventral (from the surface of the
brain). Injections of virus (0.4 ml per injection site) were performed using grad-
uated pipettes (Drummond Scientific Company), broken back to a tip diameter
of 10–15 mm, at an infusion rate of �0.05 ml/min. Micropipettes were left in
place an additional 5 min following microinjection and slowly retracted
(0.4 mm/min) to avoid reflux of the viral solution. Behavioral or electrophysio-
logical experiments were performed on the fifth week after the injection. All
injection sites were verified histologically. As criteria, we only included in
behavioral and histological analysis mice with robust expression of viral en-
coded products in the DG in at least three sections spaced 0.6 mm across
the anterior-posterior axis.
Optical fiber implants were constructed and positioned above the DG ac-
cording to the protocol described elsewhere (Sparta et al., 2012). Optical fibers
were constructed by gluing a piece of multimode optical fiber (0.39 NA 200 mm
core diameter, Thor Labs) to a 1.25 mm diameter 6.4 mm long ceramic ferrule
(Thor Labs) using epoxy resin. Fibers were cut leaving approximately 2 mm
beyond the end of the ferrule and polished on both sides using polishing sheets
of decreasing grit size. Implants were discarded if light transmission was below
80%. All optical fibers were inserted with the help of a stereotaxic frame 0.5 mm
above the DG and firmly attached to the skull using screws and dental cement
darkened with charcoal powder to prevent light efflux through the implant.

 In Vivo Remote Control of Neuronal Activity
1 hr before the behavioral test, mice expressing DREADD receptors were
intraperitoneally injected with CNO 2 mg/kg in saline solution (3.3 ml/kg).
ChR2-expressing neurons were activated by attaching a customized fiber
patch cord (0.39 NA 200 mm core diameter, Thor Labs) to the implanted
ferrules. DPSS blue light lasers (MBL-473/50 cmW; CNI Lasers) connected
to a single or double rotary joint (Doric Lenses) allowed mice to move freely
during stimulation. The laser was triggered to deliver 20 ms pulses at 10 Hz
calibrated to an output power of 6–8 mW at the fiber end. The same stimulation
protocol was used during training and recall sessions of the fear conditioning
protocol.
Spatial Exploration
Behavioral experiments were performed during the light period of the cycle.
1 week before the experiments, all animals were habituated to the experi-
menter by one or two daily sessions of 5 min handling.
SE was performed in a large (46.5 3 36.5 3 31 cm) opaque plastic cage.
Several objects (open tubes, bead filled objects, and floor grills) were placed
at different locations inside the cage. Mice were placed at random location
and allowed to explore the cage for 15 min (optogenetic experiments) or 1 hr
(chemogenetic experiments) in the dark. The different duration of SE in opto-
genetic (Figures 1A, 4B, and S6C) with respect to chemogenetic experiments
(Figures 1E, 4C, S3G, S5E, and S6B) arises from the need to reduce unspecific
effects of light delivery to brain tissue and to prevent abnormal network activity
that may result from prolonged excitatory neuron stimulation. In all cases, mice
were perfused 1 hr after the start of the exploration session.
Fear Conditioning
Contextual fear conditioning chamber consisted in a 15 3 18 cm methacry-
late cage with a metallic grid floor. The bottom of the cage was scented
with 1% ammoniac, and the back was covered with a black/white stripe
pattern to produce additional contextual cues. Mice were placed in the
cage and allowed 3 min exploration. Three mild electric shocks (0.5 mA,
2 s) were then delivered through the floor grid with 30 s interval. Mice stayed
1 min additionally before being returned to the home cage (Total training time:
5 min). Recall sessions (5 min except when noted) were performed 1 day and
1 week later in the same cage without electric shocks. Mice were perfused
1 hr after the training or last test session (1 week) for cFos analysis. Freezing
behavior was monitored by video recordings that were digitized using Any-
maze software (Stoelting). Light leakage produced during optogenetic stimu-
lation reduced the sensitivity of the freezing detection software. For this
reason, freezing behavior in experiments with light stimulation of neuronal
activity during training and recall sessions were manually scored by an exper-
imenter unaware of the condition tested.
Elevated Plus Maze
A plus shaped maze with one 35-cm-long open arm and one 35-cm-long en-
closed arm (height of the enclosure 10 cm), elevated 50 cm from the floor, was
used to monitor potential anxiogenic or anxiolitic consequences of optoge-
netic and chemogenetic manipulations of neuronal activity. Thigmotaxis was
quantified by video tracking mice position in the maze and software-based
calculations of the proportion of time spent in the open arms (time in open
arms/total test time). Total test time was 10 min.
Immunostaining and Cell Counting
Mice were injected with a lethal dose of pentobarbital (150 mg/kg) and
perfused trans-cardiacally with cold PBS and 4% paraformaldehyde solution.
Brains were extracted and submerged in fixative for 24 hr at 4�C. Six series of
coronal 50-mm-thick sections were cut in a vibratome. Immunostaining started
by blocking slices in PBS 10% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100 followed by over-
night incubation in PBS 3% BSA and 0.3%Triton X-100 with primary antibody:
cFos (rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz, RRID: AB_2106783), Arg3.1/Arc (mono-
clonal, Santa Cruz, RRID:AB_626696), SST (rat monoclonal, Millipore, RRID:
AB_2255365), GAD67 (mouse monoclonal, Millipore, RRID:AB_2278725),
and PV (rabbit polyclonal, Swant, RRID: AB_10000343). After three 15 min
washes in PBST at room temperature, slices were incubated with 1:500
Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies against the corresponding species
(Alexa-Fluor 488, 555, 645, Life Technologies). After three more steps of
washing in PBST, slices were mounted and covered on microscope slides us-
ing mounting medium. DAPI containing mounting medium was used to esti-
mate the fraction of GCs infected in behavioral experiments (Figures S1B
and S1D).
Images were obtained in a confocal laser-scanning microscopy with a Fluo-
view 300 system (Olympus) using a 488-nm argon laser and a 537-nm helium-
neon laser or in Leica SP5 confocal microscope using additional 350-nm laser
with a 203/0.7 NA oil immersion or 403/0.8 NA water immersion objectives.
A semi-automated method was used to quantify viral infection and cFos
expression in confocal images of brain slices containing the upper blade of
the DG (0.4 3 0.3 mm, �2.5 pixel/mm, 4 mm step size). Equally thresholded im-
ages were subjected to multiparticle analysis (NIH ImageJ). Region of interest
(ROI) intensity values were obtained from the z stack of raw images by using
Multi Measure tool. Colocalization was determined by overlap of the ROI ob-
tained from the two independent fluorescence signals. Analysis was per-
formed in at least three sections per animal.
Electrophysiology
Acute brain slices were used for electrophysiological experiments. Mice
were deeply anesthetized with isofluorane inhalation and decapitated. Brains
were quickly removed and immersed in ‘‘cutting’’ solution (4�C) containing
the following (in mM): 234 sucrose, 11 glucose, 26 NaHCO3, 2.5 KCl, 1.25
NaH2PO4, 10 MgSO4, and 0.5 CaCl2 (equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5%
CO2). Coronal slices (300 mm) were cut with a vibratome (Leica) and then incu-
bated in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing the
following (in mM): 126 NaCl, 26 NaHCO3, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2 MgSO4,
2 CaCl2, and 10 glucose (pH 7.4) at room temperature, before being trans-
ferred to the recording chamber. Recordings were obtained at room temper-
ature from visually identified GCs in the upper blade of the DG using infrared
video microscopy. For current clamp experiments, GCs or SST+ INs were re-
corded using patch-clamp electrodes (tip resistance, 2–3 MU) filled with an
intracellular solution containing (in mM) 70 K-gluconate, 70 KCl, 2 NaCl,
2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 2 MgATP, and 0.3 Na2GTP (pH 7.3) corrected
with KOH (290 mOsm). The intracellular solution experiments involving IPSCs
and EPSC isolation at different holding potentials, contained the following
(in mM): 125 CsMeSO3, 2 CsCl, 10 HEPES, 5 EGTA, 2 MgCl2, and 4 MgATP.
Reversal potentials for glutamate- and GABA-mediated responses were deter-
mined in separate sets of experiment, in which EPSCs and IPSCs were iso-
lated pharmacologically, using gabazine (10 mM) and DNQX (10 mM), respec-
tively (not shown). CNO, TTX (Latoxan), SR95531 (Gabazine), and kynurenic
acid (Sigma) were dissolved to the final concentration in ACSF and delivered
through the perfusion system. Optogenetic stimulation during recordings
was performed using a LED source of 470 nM coupled to a fiber guide and a
collimator lens to focus light spot around the recorded neuron. Light pulses
were of 10 ms duration with a nominal power at the exit of 0.35–0.79 mW. Se-
ries and membrane resistance were monitored regularly during experiments
and recordings were discarded when these parameters changed significantly
(>20%). Signals were amplified using a Multiclamp 200B patch-clamp ampli-
fier (Molecular Devices), sampled at 20 kHz, filtered at 10 kHz, and stored on a
PC. Data were analyzed using pClamp (Axon Instruments) software. Except
when noted, an average trace of at least ten trials was used for illustration.
Statistical Analysis
All values are given in mean ± SEM. Standard t tests were performed to
compare Gaussian distributions while Mann-Whitney tests were used for
non-Gaussian distributions. One- or two-way ANOVA with repeated-measures
followed by Bonferroni post hoc test or Kruskal-Wallis followed by Dunn post
hoc test were used when noted. For all tests, we adopted an alpha level of 0.05
to assess statistical significance. Statistical analysis was performed using
Prism (Graphpad software).
