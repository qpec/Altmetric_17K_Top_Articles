What is already known about this topic? The literature highlights the problem of poor inhaler technique, but to date no
study has identified inhaler errors associated with poor outcomes.
How does this article add to our knowledge? Specific inhaler errors, while using either a Diskus or Turbohaler dry-powder
inhaler or a metered-dose inhaler, have been identified by their frequency and their adverse impact on asthma outcomes.
How does this study impact current management guidelines? This study provides information on the key errors made
when using inhalers. These errors may be targeted in asthma management, to improve inhaler training and potentially
improve patient outcomes.
BACKGROUND: Poor inhaler technique has been linked to
poor asthma outcomes. Training can reduce the number of
inhaler errors, but it is unknown which errors have the greatest
impact on asthma outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: The CRITical Inhaler mistaKes and Asthma
controL study investigated the association between specific
inhaler errors and asthma outcomes.
METHODS: This analysis used data from the iHARP asthma
review service—a multicenter cross-sectional study of adults with
asthma. The review took place between 2011 and 2014 and
captured data from more than 5000 patients on demographic
characteristics, asthma symptoms, and inhaler errors observed by
purposefully trained health care professionals. People with
asthma receiving a fixed-dose combination treatment with inhaled

 corticosteroids and long-acting beta agonist were categorized by
the controller inhaler device they used—dry-powder inhalers or
metered-dose inhalers: inhaler errors were analyzed within device
cohorts. Error frequency, asthma symptom control, and exacer-
bation rate were analyzed to identify critical errors.
RESULTS: This report contains data from 3660 patients.
Insufficient inspiratory effort was common (made by 32%-38%
of dry-powder inhaler users) and was associated with uncon-
trolled asthma (adjusted odds ratios [95% CI], 1.30 [1.08-1.57]
and 1.56 [1.17-2.07] in those using Turbohaler and Diskus de-
vices, respectively) and increased exacerbation rate. In metered-
dose inhaler users, actuation before inhalation (24.9% of
patients) was associated with uncontrolled asthma (1.55 [1.11-
2.16]). Several more generic and device-specific errors were also
identified as critical.
CONCLUSIONS: Specific inhaler errors have been identified as
critical errors, evidenced by frequency and association with
asthma outcomes. Asthma management should target inhaler
training to reduce key critical errors.

Management of asthma is aimed at reducing the risk of ex-
acerbations and controlling symptoms.1 The effectiveness of
treatment may be impaired when inhaler devices are not used
correctly. This may lead to poorly controlled asthma, which can
reduce quality of life, limit daytime activity, and cause nighttime
wakening.2,3
Many studies have shown that errors in inhaler technique are
frequent4-9—occurring in both of the main types of inhaler de-
vices: dry-powder inhalers (DPIs) and metered-dose inhalers
(MDIs). The link between the occurrence of errors and poor
asthma outcomes has been demonstrated,10-14 and may lead to
unnecessary costs to the health care system.15 Specific types of
error may be driving these associations: however, although
studies have investigated the impact of poor inhaler technique in
general, or the impact of the number of inhaler errors, no study
has yet investigated the relative impact of individual inhaler er-
rors on asthma outcomes.
Identifying which specific errors are detrimental could lead to
improved outcomes: studies have shown that errors can be cor-
rected/reduced with increased training.8,12,16,17 A challenge of
patient training is that it relies on the ability of the clinician to
teach inhaler technique and to recognize patient errors when they
occur. Categorizing critical errors could be the optimal strategy
for improving asthma outcomes by facilitating recognition and
rectification of these errors.
The objective of the CRITical Inhaler mistaKes and Asthma
controL (CRITIKAL) study was to investigate direct relation-
ships between specific inhaler errors and asthma outcomes—
including asthma symptom control and exacerbation rate—in
both DPIs and MDIs, and to determine the critical errors for
each inhaler type.
METHODS
Data source and permissions
This study, labeled the CRITIKAL study, used data from the
iHARP (initiative Helping Asthma in Real-life Patients18) data-
base—an asthma review service supported by the Respiratory
Effectiveness Group.19 iHARP collected data prospectively between
June 2011 and December 2014 in participating primary care prac-
tices in Australia and 7 European countries (United Kingdom, Italy,
Spain, the Netherlands, France, Norway, and Sweden). Each of
these practices received an identical iHARP asthma review service.
Patients were included if they had a diagnosis of asthma, and
excluded if they had a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease or any other chronic respiratory disease other than asthma.
The iHARP review used questionnaire-led and practitioner-led as-
sessments to collect extensive information about the patients’ de-
mographic characteristics, asthma symptoms, lung function, inhaler
technique, and occurrence of exacerbations. The iHARP database
collected anonymized data from more than 5000 patients with
asthma.
Practices participating in the iHARP asthma review obtained
ethics approval according to the requirements specific to their
country and gave permission for their anonymized data to be used
for research purposes. Permission to link UK data to electronic
medical records was obtained from the Health Research Authority
for clinical research use (REC reference 15/EM/0150). The iHARP
database is governed by the Anonymous Data Ethics Protocols and
Transparency committee, an independent body of experts and reg-
ulators commissioned by the Respiratory Effectiveness Group19 to
govern the standard of research conducted on internationally
renowned databases. The Anonymous Data Ethics Protocols and
Transparency committee gave approval for the CRITIKAL study to
use iHARP data. Individual ethics approvals were granted in most
countries. The CRITIKAL study was registered with the European
Network of Centers for Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacovigi-
lance20 (as ENCePP/SDPP/9651).
Study design and cohorts
The CRITIKAL study was a cross-sectional, observational anal-
ysis using data collected for the iHARP asthma review. Patients were
allocated to device cohorts, according to which inhaler device they
were using for their controller/preventer medication, that is, a spe-
cific type of DPI or MDI. Analyses were then carried out within
device cohorts.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Patients were included in the analysis if all the following criteria
were met: they were 16 years or older at the date of their iHARP
review; they were receiving combined asthma therapy as fixed-dose
combination with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta
agonist via a DPI or MDI (evidenced by at least 1 prescription in the
year before their iHARP review); and their iHARP review contained
all study-relevant data and met standards of the International Pri-
mary Care Respiratory Group,21 Global Initiative for Asthma
guidelines,22
and
Quality
and
Outcomes

recommendations.
Patients were excluded from the study if they had received oral
corticosteroids and/or antibiotics for a lower respiratory tract con-
dition in the 2 weeks preceding their iHARP review, or they had
received long-term systemic treatments for asthma, including
maintenance, theophylline, leukotriene receptor antagonist, or anti-
IgE therapy. These exclusions were specified to minimize any po-
tential confounding by additional medications.
All types of device were considered for inclusion, but were
included in the analysis only if the total number of patients using
that device met the sample size requirement for a single device
cohort. Details of the power calculation and sample size re-
quirements are given in the Statistical Analysis section.
Record of inhaler errors
In the iHARP review, inhaler technique was assessed and number
and type of inhaler error were recorded for each inhaler device
against predefined checklists. Technique was assessed by purpose-
fully trained medical professionals. Observation of errors was stan-
dardized as much as possible by having assessors watch dedicated
inhaler videos for the relevant device types, as part of their training.
The final list of potential errors for each device was provided by
clinical experts in the steering committee, after grouping similar
errors from original lists (see Tables E1-E3 in this article’s Online
Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org).

 Outcome measures
The primary outcome measure for this study was asthma symp-
tom control. Patients were categorized into the following 3 cate-
gories: controlled, partly controlled, and uncontrolled. These
categories were defined according to Global Initiative for Asthma
guidelines (Global Initiative for Asthma),22 using responses from the
iHARP review questionnaire. The questionnaire asked patients if
they experienced the following during the previous week:
- Daytime symptoms (more than twice/week)
- Any night waking due to asthma
- Needed reliever inhaler (more than twice/week)
- Any limitation to daytime activity
The presence of these 4 symptoms determined the asthma
symptom control category as follows:
- None of above /controlled
- 1 or 2 of above /partly controlled
- 3 or 4 of above/uncontrolled
The primary outcome was estimated as an odds ratio (OR) for the
likelihood of being in the uncontrolled asthma category. This OR
compared patients who made a specific inhaler error with those who
did not make that error.
The secondary outcome measure was a rate ratio (RR) for ex-
acerbations, comparing the number of exacerbations experienced
in a fixed period by patients who made a specific inhaler error
with the number experienced by patients who did not make that
error. The number of exacerbations was taken from the 12-month
period preceding the iHARP review and exacerbations were
identified by 1 of the following patient-reported events: hospital
admission with breathing or chest problems; accident and
emergency attendance related to asthma; or an acute course of oral
steroids for worsening asthma.
Statistical analysis
Summary statistics of patient characteristics were computed for
the total study sample, including demographic variables, inhaler
device used, and number of exacerbations in the previous year. These
were compared across the 3 categories of asthma symptom control
using chi-square tests. Frequency of inhaler errors was computed.
Correlations between errors of the same device were investigated
using Spearman rank correlation coefficient.
The primary analysis used ordinal logistic regression to examine
the association between specific types of inhaler error and uncon-
trolled asthma. The ORs represented the odds of patients being in
the uncontrolled category, over the partly controlled and controlled
categories. Univariable models (with a single error only) were fitted
for each type of error, within device cohorts. For errors that were
significant at this stage, multivariable models were fitted. The first
multivariable model included all errors that were significant in the
univariable case. The second multivariable model added relevant
patient factors to the previous multivariable model. Final models
were arrived at following a backwards elimination procedure, where
the full model was fitted and then nonsignificant variables removed
one by one. A list of the variables in the iHARP database that were
investigated as potential confounders in the multivariable models can
be found in the Methods section in this article’s Online Repository
at www.jaci-inpractice.org. Poisson regression models were fitted for
the secondary analyses, to estimate exacerbation RRs for the
important inhaler errors identified in primary analyses.
Sensitivity analyses were carried out in which the above models
were further adjusted by patient adherence. This is a potential
confounder when comparing asthma outcomes because poor out-
comes may be an indication of poor adherence to treatment. Patient
adherence was recorded in the iHARP database using the Medica-
tion Adherence Rating Scale,24 and in this case was categorized into
the following groups: poor, borderline, and good (more details can
be found in the Methods section in this article’s Online Repository).
This variable was not used as adjustment in the main analysis
because it may not be a strong measure of adherence.25
The level of statistical significance was set at 5% (ie, P < .05). A
power calculation was carried out to determine the number of pa-
tients required to detect an OR of 1.25 in the main analysis (more
details in the Methods section in this article’s Online Repository). If
individual device cohorts did not meet the sample size requirement
to achieve 80% power, they were not included in the study. All
categorization and coding of variables were approved by the steering
committee. Analyses were carried out using STATA version 14
(StataCorp, College Station, Texas).
RESULTS
Patients
After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 4276 patients
with asthma were available for study in the iHARP database. Six
device cohorts were formed, on the basis of the type of inhaler device
used by patients. Three of these cohorts were excluded from the final
studysamplebecausetheydidnothaveasufficientsamplesizeforthe
main analysis. The excluded device cohorts were Seretide MDI with
spacer (Glaxo Wellcome Operations, Ware, UK) (n ¼ 242), Fostair
MDI (Chiesi Farmaceutici, Parma, Italy) (n ¼ 304), and Fostair
MDI with spacer (n ¼ 76). Hence, the final study sample (N ¼
3660) contained 3 device cohorts: 2 DPI cohorts—Turbohaler-
Symbicort (AstraZeneca, Södertälje, Sweden) (n ¼ 2074 [49% of
total eligible cohort]) and Diskus-Seretide (Glaxo Wellcome Oper-
ations) (n ¼ 826 [19%])—and 1 MDI cohort—MDI Seretide
(Glaxo Wellcome Operations) (n ¼ 760 [18%]) (see Figure E1 in
this article’s Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org).
Most patients were aged 41 to 60 years (46%) and female
(60%). Approximately 45% were current or ex-smokers, and
65% had mild or significant rhinitis. Younger age, being female,
high body mass index, smoking, rhinitis, and paracetamol use
were all significantly associated with a higher proportion of un-
controlled asthma (Table I). These variables, including paracet-
amol use, were among those considered as potential confounders
in the main analysis. Of the total study sample, approximately
46% had controlled asthma, 34% had partly controlled asthma,
and 19% had uncontrolled asthma. There was no significant
difference in these proportions across devices.
Type and frequency of inhaler errors
For each type of device, a list of 14 inhaler error types was
created (Tables E1-E3) and the frequencies of each error may be
seen in Table II. Errors related to inspiratory effort were frequent
in all 3 device cohorts. In the DPI cohorts, the inhalation was
insufficiently fast and forceful in 32.1% of patients using
Turbohaler and in 38.4% of patients using Diskus. In the MDI
cohort, the inspiratory effort was not slow and deep enough in
47.2% of patients. In the Turbohaler cohort, the most frequent
errors were “twist errors,” made by 49% of patients. These
included not holding the inhaler device in the upright position
(as is required), and not twisting the base of the device twice

 (1 time in each direction). An error common to all devices was
not having the head tilted with chin up during inhalation: 34.3%
of patients made this error in the Turbohaler cohort, 34.6% in
the Diskus cohort, and 34.1% in the MDI cohort. Another error
common to all 3 cohorts was not breathing out to empty lungs
before inhalation (error rate was 26.2% in the Turbohaler
cohort, 32.4% in the Diskus cohort, and 25.4% in the MDI
cohort).
The total number of errors made by patients varied signifi-
cantly by device type (P < .001). The proportion of patients
making no errors was greatest in the Diskus cohort (29.7% vs
19.5% and 13.4% in the Turbohaler and MDI cohorts,
respectively), whereas the proportion of patients making 5þ
errors was greatest in the MDI cohort (17.2% vs 8.1% and 5.9%
in the Turbohaler and Diskus cohorts, respectively; see Table E4
in this article’s Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org).
Association with uncontrolled asthma
In unadjusted analysis, many of the inhaler errors were
significantly associated with asthma symptom control, that is,
were associated with increased odds of being in the uncontrolled
asthma category. In the Turbohaler and MDI cohorts, 8 of 14
errors had a significant association, whereas 4 of 14 errors in the
Diskus cohort had a significant association (Table III).
DPI cohorts. For the DPI cohorts, associations that remained
significant when all errors were included in the model are pre-
sented in Figure 1. Further adjustment was made by the
following patient factors: age, sex, body mass index, smoking,
rhinitis, and paracetamol use. Other potential confounders, listed
in the Methods section in this article’s Online Repository, were
found to be unimportant in the final multivariable models. After
adjusting for patient factors, “insufficient inspiratory effort” was

the uncontrolled asthma category: adjusted ORs (95% CI) were
1.30 (1.08-1.57) for Turbohaler and 1.56 (1.17-2.07) for
Diskus. In the Turbohaler cohort only, “compromised dose
because of shaking or tipping device” and “failure to remove cap”
had strong associations with uncontrolled asthma, but were
infrequent (3.4% and 0.4%, respectively). There was no asso-
ciation between the frequent error “did not breathe out to empty
lungs before inhalation” and uncontrolled asthma.
Results from a sensitivity analysis to adjust for patient
adherence can be seen in Figure E2 in this article’s Online

The most frequent error, “inspiratory effort not slow and deep,” was
not associated with uncontrolled asthma when it was included in a
multivariable model with other inhaler errors. Errors related to de-
vice knowledge and second dose preparation (made by 34.7% of
patients) were significantly associated with uncontrolled asthma
(OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.10-2.00), after adjustment by patient factors.
Actuation before inhalation was common (made by 24.9% of
patients) and was associated with uncontrolled asthma after
adjustment by patient factors (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.11-2.16).
“Exhaling into the inhaler device or not holding device upright” had
a significant association with uncontrolled asthma (OR, 1.58; 95%
CI, 1.01-2.47), but was less frequent (14.3%). All these errors
remained significantly associated with uncontrolled asthma after
further adjustment by patient adherence (see Figure E3 in this
article’s Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org).

(Turbohaler only), and not removing cap from device (Tur-
bohaler only). Aside from “not sealing lips around the mouth-
piece,” these results reflect those from the primary analysis.
Adjusted RRs (with 95% CI) for “insufficient inspiratory effort”
were 1.29 (1.04-1.60) for patients using Turbohaler and 1.55
(1.17-2.07) for patients using Diskus. Associations for the other
significant errors were stronger (RRs approaching 2.00 and

In the sensitivity analysis, “insufficient inspiratory effort” and
“not sealing lips around mouthpiece” remained significantly
associated with increased exacerbation rate in Turbohaler users
(see Figure E4 in this article’s Online Repository at www.jaci-

technique in asthma is associated with reduced control10,11 and
increased hospital visits.10 The CRITIKAL study is the first
study to observe associations between specific inhaler errors and

 poorer asthma outcomes, including increased likelihood of hav-
ing uncontrolled symptoms and increased exacerbation rate.
Errors were frequent (made by over 30% of patients in a number
of cases), and were device-specific as well as generic across
devices.
The findings of this study are consistent with evidence in the
literature. A recent systematic review has shown that over the
past 40 years the frequency and type of inhaler errors have not
changed.26 Generic errors, such as not exhaling, not holding the
breath, insufficient speed of inhalation, dose preparation errors
for DPIs, and coordination problems with MDIs, were the most
common. The CRITIKAL study aimed to identify critical
inhaler errors, with “critical” meaning those related to poor
disease outcomes. The results provide useful indications of which
errors could be classified as critical. Those identified in this study
were consistent with errors identified in the recent systematic
review.
One critical error in this study was insufficient inspiratory
effort when using a DPI. All DPIs demonstrate flow-dependent
dose emission and therefore the generic instruction when using
these is to inhale as fast as possible.27 In vitro dose emission28 and
gamma scintigraphy29 have highlighted this phenomenon, but
clinical evidence demonstrating the relevance of these laboratory
and lung deposition studies is missing. The CRITIKAL study
confirmed the importance of fast inhalation. Another generic
inhalation error with DPIs, though not frequent, was failure to
seal the lips around the mouthpiece, which was found to be
associated with an increased rate of exacerbations when using the
Turbohaler device.
In vitro data have shown the importance of dose preparation
when using the Turbohaler.30 Dose preparation errors in DPIs,
such as not twisting the base of the Turbohaler, were frequent in
this study, but were not associated with worse asthma outcomes.
In vitro studies have also shown that exhaling into the mouth-
piece of a DPI affects the quality of the dose that is emitted,30,31
but again, no association with worse outcomes was found in this
study. This could be due to study limitations, discussed later in
this section, or because these errors were correlated with other
types of error that had a stronger impact.
Errors related to the second dose were critical for MDIs. This
included exhaling into the inhaler before preparing the second
dose, making a second inhalation from the first dose without
preparing the second dose, and not waiting at least 30 seconds
between inhaling the first and second doses (to permit refill of
the chamber).
Not exhaling before an inhalation and not holding the breath
are generic errors relevant to all devices. Studies have suggested
that exhaling before an inhalation and breath-hold lead to greater
lung deposition.32-34 Although associations were not significant
in the multivariable models in this study, absence of both these
actions was shown to have a significant univariable association
with uncontrolled asthma. Not tilting the head slightly back is
another generic inhalation manoeuvre—tilting is advised to
ensure the medication particles remain entrained in the inhaled
airstream. This error was associated with uncontrolled asthma in
univariable analyses.
Slow inhalation is advised when using MDI devices (for better
lung deposition) and has been linked to improvement in quality
of life when patients have good coordination.35 However, the
results of this study did not show an impact on outcomes when
inhalation was too fast. Rather, the critical MDI error found in
this study was poor coordination between the start of an inha-
lation and actuation of the dose (actuation coming before
inhalation). This is in contrast with results seen in gamma
scintigraphy studies, which suggested this was not important.33
The CRITIKAL study results also highlighted “exhaling into
the mouthpiece or not holding the inhaler upright” as a critical
MDI error.
The CRITIKAL study is one of the largest studies to be
carried out to investigate inhaler technique, and was carried out
on a real-life, multinational study population. The results pro-
vide detailed evidence about inhaler technique, evidence that has
previously been called for in the literature.36,37 The analysis
allowed for potential confounding where possible, using patient
factors known to influence asthma symptoms and response to
medications.38 The database contained other potential con-
founders, such as medication dose, which were also investigated
for possible bias. Despite these measures, because of the design of
this study—observational, rather than a randomized trial—there
remains the possibility of confounding by unmeasured factors.
A limitation of any study that relies on potentially subjective
observations is the possibility of interrater variability; that is,
several observers may record the same information in different
ways. The results of this study relied on the observations of
inhaler errors by health care professionals who were purposefully
trained. The study attempted to reduce interrater variability by
training study personnel using the same materials (including
video instruction), across the participating practices. However, it
remains a possibility that variability in the assessment of the
errors could have biased the results of the study. It may also have
reduced the power of the study, which could explain in-
consistencies between device cohorts.
The CRITIKAL study used inhaler technique information
collected from 1 observation and made the assumption that
observed errors reflected a pattern of misuse in that patient. It
included only those patients with asthma who were receiving
inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta agonist combined in
a single device: but because this is the most commonly used
treatment for asthma, it is likely that the findings are generaliz-
able. This study did not examine any patterns with inhaled
corticosteroid dose in particular; however, it is possible that in
patients receiving high doses of inhaled corticosteroid, the impact
of incorrect inhaler technique was underestimated. It has been
shown that dose response levels off at approximately 500 mg, yet
prescriptions above this dose are common.39,40 When a larger
dose is inhaled, an effective amount may still reach its target even
if inhaler errors are made. Thus, the effect of errors may
potentially be greater than what was observed in the CRITIKAL
study, when doses are in the recommended range.
Sensitivity analyses were carried out to account for possible
confounding by adherence, which has been linked to inhaler
errors and asthma outcomes.41 Several critical errors remained
significantly associated with uncontrolled asthma. However,
patient-reported adherence was not used in the main analysis
because it has sometimes been shown to be an unreliable measure
of adherence.25,42
The results from this study provide evidence to support
changes to routine patient management and structured review,
with targeted training to reduce critical errors. Greater emphasis
on inhaler training has been called for in the literature36,37—for
patients as well as for the health care professionals managing the
patients.43

 CONCLUSIONS
Specific inhaler errors have been identified as critical errors,
evidenced by frequency and association with poor asthma out-
comes. Primary and secondary care management should target
inhaler training to reduce critical errors.

 METHODS
Determining adherence
Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MARS) adherence was
reported using the MARS score. This measures adherence on a 6-
point scale (never, rarely, sometimes, regular, often, and always)
in response to the following questions about their controller
inhaler use:
� I use it only when I feel breathless.
� I avoid using it if I can.
� I forget to take it.
� I decide to miss a dose.
� I choose to take it once a day.
Adherence was categorized as poor (any of the questions
answered with “often” or “always”), borderline (more than 1
question with “sometimes”), and good (none of above).
Power calculation
The power calculation was based on the logistic regression that
would be performed in the primary analysis. The effect size to be
detected was an OR of 0.8 (or 1.25 when reference group is
reversed), and this assumed a proportion of 0.65 controlled pa-
tients with asthma in the category of interest and a proportion of
0.7 controlled patients with asthma in the reference category. The
calculation assumed a correlation among covariates of R2 ¼ 1 and
used a 2-tailed test with a ¼ 0.025. The calculation determined
that 752 patients were required to achieve 80% power in an
individual device cohort.
Potential confounders
The following variables were available in the iHARP database
and were investigated as potential confounders in multivariable
models:
� Age of patient at time of iHARP review
� Sex
� Body mass index
� Smoking status at time of iHARP review, and packs per year
for current smokers and ex-smokers
� Socioeconomic status marker (highest education attained)
� Country where iHARP review took place
� Year of iHARP review
� Duration of asthma (years)
� Peak inspiratory flow: Assessed using a Vitelograph AIMS
device for the global populations and a Vitelograph Spiromax
for the UK and Australia populations
� Peak expiratory flow
� Unrelated comorbidities expressed using the Charlson co-
morbidity index
� Presence of comorbid diseases, including connective tissue
disease, chronic pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure,
myocardial infarction, tumors peripheral vascular disease, ulcer
diagnosis, leukemia, dementia, liver disease, lymphoma, dia-
betes mellitus, hemiplegia, cerebrovascular disease, moderate
or severe renal disease, AIDS
� Presence of patient-reported rhinitis and severity: Rhinitis
symptoms were recorded in response to the question “Do you
have any of these symptoms: itchy, runny, blocked nose or
sneezing when you don’t have a cold?” Rhinitis was catego-
rized as None (answered question with “No”), Mild Rhinitis
(answered question with “Occasionally and little bother” or
“Most days and a little bother”), Severe Rhinitis (answered
question with “Occasionally and quite a bother” or “Most days
and a lot of bother”)
� Presence of gastroesophageal reflux disease, self-reported
� Patient-reported side effects, including continual sore mouth/
throat, oral thrush, bruising, hoarse voice, abnormal weight
gain, and cough
� Adherence to therapy (MARS score, described above in
Methods section)
� Paracetamol use, reported by the patients as regular, inter-
mittent, or not used
� Currently prescribed combination therapy and dose
