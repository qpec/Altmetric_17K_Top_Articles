Disparities in State-Specific Adult Fruit and Vegetable Consumption — 
United States, 2015
Seung Hee Lee-Kwan, PhD1; Latetia V. Moore, PhD1; Heidi M. Blanck, PhD1; Diane M. Harris, PhD1; Deb Galuska, PhD1
The 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recom-
mend that Americans consume more fruits and vegetables 
as part of an overall dietary pattern to reduce the risk for 
diet-related chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, 
type 2 diabetes, some cancers, and obesity (1). Adults should 
consume 1.5–2.0 cup equivalents of fruits and 2.0–3.0 cups of 
vegetables per day.* Overall, few adults in each state met intake 
recommendations according to 2013 Behavioral Risk Factor 
Surveillance System (BRFSS) data; however, sociodemographic 
characteristics known to be associated with fruit and vegetable 
consumption were not examined (2). CDC used data from the 
2015 BRFSS to update the 2013 report and to estimate the 
percentage of each state’s population meeting intake recom-
mendations by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and income-to-poverty 
ratio (IPR) for the 50 states and District of Columbia (DC). 
Overall, 12.2% of adults met fruit recommendations rang-
ing from 7.3% in West Virginia to 15.5% in DC, and 9.3% 
met vegetable recommendations, ranging from 5.8% in West 
Virginia to 12.0% in Alaska. Intake was low across all socio-
economic groups. Overall, the prevalence of meeting the fruit 
intake recommendation was highest among women (15.1%), 
adults aged 31–50 years (13.8%), and Hispanics (15.7%); the 
prevalence of meeting the vegetable intake recommendation 
was highest among women (10.9%), adults aged ≥51 years 
(10.9%), and persons in the highest income group (11.4%). 
Evidence-based strategies that address barriers to fruit and 
vegetable consumption such as cost or limited availability 
could improve consumption and help prevent diet-related 
chronic disease.
BRFSS conducts an annual, state-based, random-digit–
dialed landline and cellular telephone household survey of

active adults might be able to consume more while staying within calorie needs.

noninstitutionalized, civilian U.S. adults aged ≥18 years to col-
lect data on health and health risk behaviors related to chronic 
disease. BRFSS uses a complex multistage cluster sampling 
design and weights by iterative proportional fitting to adjust 
for nonresponse, noncoverage, and selection bias (3). In 2015, 
BRFSS asked six questions to assess how many times per day, 
week, or month the participants consumed 1) 100% fruit 
juice, 2) whole fruit, 3) dried beans, 4) dark green vegetables, 
 
5) orange vegetables, and 6) other vegetables, during the 
previous month. Daily frequency of intake was calculated by 
dividing reported intake by 7 for intake reported by week, and 
by 30 for intake reported by month. To estimate the percentage 
of each state’s population meeting fruit and vegetable intake 
recommendations by demographic characteristics, previously 
developed scoring algorithms derived from the National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were 
used to predict whether a respondent met fruit and vegetable 
recommendations for their age and sex based on the number 
of times per day they reported consuming fruits and vegetables

separately, accounting for race/ethnicity and IPR (poverty 
defined according to federal poverty guidelines†), updated 
with 2015 Poverty Guidelines for the 48 contiguous states and 
DC. IPR was calculated following the previous study methods 
(4) using the midpoint of reported household income for 
persons who reported their household income; household size 
was assumed to equal one for participants who did not report 
the number of persons residing in the household. Individual 
predicted probabilities of meeting recommendations were 
averaged to obtain sociodemographic-specific estimates. Intake 
recommendations were based on the 2015–2020 Dietary 
Guidelines for Americans (1) and used the age- and sex-specific 
recommendations for adults who engage in <30 minutes of 
moderate physical activity daily. BRFSS respondents’ race/
ethnicity (Hispanic, non-Hispanic black [black], non-Hispanic 
white [white], and all others) and IPR (<1.25, 1.25%–3.49%, 
and >3.49) were defined consistent with definitions in previous 
analyses (5). Estimates for the racial/ethnic group “other” are 
not presented because of the small sample sizes and difficul-
ties in providing meaningful interpretation, but are included 
in overall estimates and those by age, sex, and IPR. Among 
441,456 respondents, 122,041 (28%) were excluded, including 
5,074 who did not reside in the 50 states or DC (because the 
scoring algorithm is derived from NHANES, which excluded 
territories), 58,949 who did not answer all six questions on 
fruit and vegetable intake, 127 who had implausible values of

reported intake of fruit more than 16 times per day or veg-
etables more than 23 times per day (4), and 55,891 who had 
missing values for income, resulting in a final analytic sample 
of 319,415. The median response rate for 2015 BRFSS§ was 
47.2% for the 50 states and DC (range = 33.9%–61.1%). 
T-tests were used to compare differences by demographic 
groups. Statistical analyses were performed to account for the 
complex survey design and nonresponse. Balanced repeated 
replication technique, replicate weights, and Taylor lineariza-
tion were used to calculate standard errors and confidence 
intervals, consistent with the previous study (2).
In 2015, the median frequency of reported intake among all 
respondents was one time per day for fruit and 1.7 times per 
day for vegetables (Table 1). Among all respondents, 12.2% 
met fruit intake recommendations, ranging from 7.3% in West 
Virginia to 15.5% in DC, and 9.3% met vegetable intake 
recommendations, ranging from 5.8% in West Virginia to 
12.0% in Alaska (Table 1). Overall in 2015, the percentage of 
adults meeting fruit and vegetable recommendations varied by 
selected characteristics (Table 2) (Table 3). A higher propor-
tion of women met both fruit and vegetable recommenda-
tions (15.1% and 10.9%, respectively) than did men (9.2% 
and 7.6%, respectively), and a higher proportion of women 
met recommendations in most states. By age group, young 
adults aged 18–30 years accounted for the lowest proportion 
of persons meeting recommendations for fruit and vegetable

significantly different from the referent group of adults aged 
≥51 years, 12.4% and 10.9% of whom met intake recom-
mendations for fruit and vegetables, respectively. Findings 
varied by state; in 41 states, a significantly lower percentage 
of young adults met recommendations for vegetable intake 
than did older adults, whereas this pattern was only observed 
for fruit intake in 18 states. A significantly higher propor-
tion of Hispanics and blacks met recommendations for fruit 
intake than did whites; however, these differences were only 
significant in 10 states (Table 2). There were no significant 
differences in meeting recommendations for vegetable intake

by race/ethnicity. In general, by state, lower percentages of 
blacks met recommendation for vegetable intake than did 
whites and Hispanics. Overall, a significantly higher percent-
age of persons with IPR >3.49 met recommendations for 
vegetable intake than did those with IPR ≤3.49, although no 
significant differences for meeting recommendations for fruit 
intake by IPR were observed. By state, a higher percentage 
of persons living in households with incomes in the highest 
category (IPR >3.49) met the recommendation for vegetable 
intake than did persons living below or close to the poverty 
level (IPR <1.25); these differences were significant in four 
states for fruits and 35 states for vegetables.
Discussion
Overall, the proportion of adults meeting fruit and veg-
etable intake recommendations remained low in 2015, with 
more persons meeting recommendations for fruit intake than 
vegetable intake, and with substantial variations by state, age, 
sex, race/ethnicity, and IPR. Consistent with earlier studies of 
BRFSS data (5,6), a higher percentage of women than men 
and a higher percentage of adults aged ≥51 years than persons 
aged 18–30 years met recommendations for fruit and vegetable 
intake. Findings are also consistent with earlier work demon-
strating larger IPR-related disparities in vegetable than fruit 
intake as well as a significantly higher prevalence of meeting 
recommendations for fruit intake among blacks and Hispanics 
than among whites (5). However, this analysis did not observe 
previously reported significantly lower prevalences of meet-
ing recommendations for vegetable intake among Hispanics 
and blacks compared with whites; that study measured the 
percentage of respondents who consumed vegetables more 
than three times per day rather than the age- and sex-specific 
cup-equivalent measure used in the current analysis.
Because fruit and vegetable consumption affects mul-
tiple health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, 
type 2 diabetes, some cancers, and obesity (1) and is currently 
low among adults in all states and demographic subgroups, 
continued efforts are needed to identify and address barriers 
to fruit and vegetable consumption. A recent review identified 
several barriers, including high cost, limited availability and 
access, and perceived lack of preparation time (7,8). The CDC 
Guide to Strategies to Increase the Consumption of Fruits and 
Vegetables¶ identifies 10 strategies to increase access to and 
improve the availability of fruits and vegetables. Examples 
include starting or expanding farm-to-institution programs 
in childcare, schools, hospitals, workplaces, and other institu-
tions; improving access to retail stores and markets that sell 
high quality fruits and vegetables; and ensuring access to fruits

and vegetables in cafeterias and other food service venues in 
worksites, hospitals, and universities. To address cost, the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Insecurity Nutrition 
Incentive (FINI) grant program** supports projects to increase 
the purchase of fruits and vegetables among low-income con-
sumers participating in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance 
Program, by providing incentives at the point of purchase; 
FINI projects are currently underway in 26 states.††
The findings in this report are subject to at least six limita-
tions. First, estimates did not include non-100% fruit juice 
or fried potatoes because the BRFSS questionnaire instructs 
respondents to exclude them. These foods were excluded from 
BRFSS because federal dietary guidelines recommend limiting 
foods and beverages with added sugars and solid fats such as 
these (1); estimates therefore represent intake from healthier 
sources. Including these additional sources of fruits and veg-
etables results in 4%–6% higher estimates for fruit intake and 
30%–44% higher estimates for vegetable intake (4). Second, 
because the data are self-reported, they are subject to biases 
that might result in either overestimates or underestimates of 
actual fruit and vegetable consumption, and different demo-
graphic groups might differentially misreport intake.§§ Third, 
the BRFSS survey excludes persons living in nursing homes, 
long-term care facilities, military installations, and correctional 
institutions, and thus these data are not generalizable to the 
entire U.S. population. Moreover, territories were excluded 
from this analysis because the scoring algorithms were derived 
from NHANES, which excludes territories. Fourth, using the 
scoring algorithms to estimate intake might have resulted in 
measurement error. However, previous analyses showed that 
applying prediction equations to 2011 BRFSS frequency data 
yielded estimates comparable to 2007–2010 national estimates 
that used more accurate 24-hour recalls (4). Fifth, approxi-
mately 13% of participants had fruit and vegetable data missing 
(58,949 participants). These respondents included a higher 
proportion of older adults and persons with IPR <1.25, similar 
to a previous study (4). A sensitivity analysis demonstrated that 
estimates did not change when persons with complete data for 
fruit intake, but not vegetables, or when persons with complete 
data for vegetable intake but not fruit were included. Finally, 
among the 375,306 eligible participants who had complete 
information for fruit and vegetable intakes and resided in the 
study area, 13% (55,891 participants) were excluded because 
they did not report household income. Estimated percent-
ages of persons meeting recommendations were similar when

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Consuming enough fruits and vegetables as part of an overall 
healthy diet reduces the risk of many chronic diseases, includ-
ing cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, some cancers, and 
obesity. However, the percentage of the adult population 
meeting fruit and vegetable intake recommendation is low. In 
2013, 13.1% of respondents met fruit intake recommendations 
and 8.9% met vegetable recommendations.
What is added by this report?
Recent data show adults continue to consume too few fruits and 
vegetables; overall, 12.2% met fruit intake recommendations and 
9.3% met vegetable intake recommendations during 2015. 
Consumption was lower among men, young adults, and adults 
with greater poverty, and varied by state. Among subgroups, the 
largest disparities in meeting the recommendation for fruit intake 
was by sex (15.1% among women compared with 9.2% among 
men), while the largest disparities in meeting the recommenda-
tion for vegetable intake was by poverty (11.4% among adults in 
the highest household income category compared with 7.0% 
among adults below or close to the poverty level).
What are the implications for public health practice?
States can use this information to inform the development of 
policies and programs that help all adults regardless of 
sociodemographic groups to consume more fruits and 
vegetables and thus help to prevent costly chronic diseases.
income was imputed for persons with missing household 
income based on age, sex, and race/ethnicity. The estimates 
without imputation are presented to be consistent with previ-
ous studies (2,4) which allow states to compare estimates for 
surveillance purposes.
Despite the positive health benefits of consuming fruits and 
vegetables, the findings from this study corroborate data showing 
that the vast majority of adults consume insufficient amounts, 
with lower intakes among men, young adults, and adults living in 
poverty. For most states, the only source of state-level nutritional 
data for adults is fruit and vegetable intake data from BRFSS. 
States can use this information to inform the development of 
policies and programs that help all adults regardless of sociode-
mographic group to consume more fruits and vegetables and 
thus help prevent costly chronic diseases.
