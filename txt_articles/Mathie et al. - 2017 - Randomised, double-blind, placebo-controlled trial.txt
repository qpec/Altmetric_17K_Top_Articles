Abstract
Background: A rigorous systematic review and meta-analysis focused on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of non-
individualised homeopathic treatment has not previously been reported. We tested the null hypothesis that the main
outcome of treatment using a non-individualised (standardised) homeopathic medicine is indistinguishable from that of
placebo. An additional aim was to quantify any condition-specific effects of non-individualised homeopathic treatment.
Methods: Literature search strategy, data extraction and statistical analysis all followed the methods described in a pre-
published protocol. A trial comprised ‘reliable evidence’ if its risk of bias was low or it was unclear in one specified domain
of assessment. ‘Effect size’ was reported as standardised mean difference (SMD), with arithmetic transformation
for dichotomous data carried out as required; a negative SMD indicated an effect favouring homeopathy.
Results: Forty-eight different clinical conditions were represented in 75 eligible RCTs. Forty-nine trials were classed as
‘high risk of bias’ and 23 as ‘uncertain risk of bias’; the remaining three, clinically heterogeneous, trials displayed
sufficiently low risk of bias to be designated reliable evidence. Fifty-four trials had extractable data: pooled SMD was
–0.33 (95% confidence interval (CI) –0.44, –0.21), which was attenuated to –0.16 (95% CI –0.31, –0.02) after adjustment for
publication bias. The three trials with reliable evidence yielded a non-significant pooled SMD: –0.18 (95% CI –0.46, 0.09).
There was no single clinical condition for which meta-analysis included reliable evidence.
Conclusions: The quality of the body of evidence is low. A meta-analysis of all extractable data leads to rejection of our
null hypothesis, but analysis of a small sub-group of reliable evidence does not support that rejection. Reliable evidence is
lacking in condition-specific meta-analyses, precluding relevant conclusions. Better designed and more rigorous RCTs are
needed in order to develop an evidence base that can decisively provide reliable effect estimates of non-individualised
homeopathic treatment.

 Background
Homeopathy is a system of medicine based fundamen-
tally on the ‘Principle of Similars’: a substance capable of
causing symptoms of illness in a healthy subject can be
used as a medicine to treat similar patterns of symptoms
experienced by an individual who is ill; homeopathic
medicines are believed to stimulate a self-regulatory
healing response in the patient [1]. There are several dis-
tinct forms of homeopathy, the main types being ‘indivi-
dualised homeopathy’
, ‘clinical homeopathy’ and ‘isopathy’.
In individualised homeopathy, typically a single homeo-
pathic medicine is selected on the basis of the ‘total symp-
tom picture’ of a patient, including his/her mental, general
and constitutional type. In clinical homeopathy, one or
more homeopathic medicines are administered for stand-
ard clinical situations or conventional diagnoses; where
more than one medicine is used in a fixed preparation, it
is referred to as a ‘combination’ (devised by researchers)
or ‘complex’ homeopathic medicine (available as an over-
the-counter [OTC] proprietary formulation). Isopathy is
the use of homeopathic dilutions from the causative agent
of the disease itself, or from a product of the disease
process, to treat the condition [1]: isopathic medicines in-
clude organisms and allergens prescribed on a basis that is
different from individualised homeopathic prescribing in
the classical sense.
To inform appropriate research development in hom-
eopathy, the nature of its existing research evidence
needs to be examined with rigour, objectivity and trans-
parency. In a previous systematic review of randomised
controlled trials (RCTs) of individualised treatment, we
concluded there was a small, statistically significant, ef-
fect of the individually prescribed homeopathic medi-
cines that was robust to sensitivity analysis based on
reliable evidence; however, the low or uncertain quality
of the evidence prevented a decisive conclusion [2].
In
contrast
to
individualised
treatment,
placebo-
controlled RCTs of non-individualised homeopathic treat-
ment evaluate interventions that have involved the same,
standardised, medication allocated to each and every par-
ticipant randomised to homeopathy in a given trial: single
homeopathic medicine, combination or complex homeo-
pathic medicine, or isopathy. In this RCT context, none of
these approaches involves matching a patient with the
‘total symptom picture’ of an individually prescribed
homeopathic medicine: a pre-selected medicine is applied
to the typical symptoms of a clinical condition. In the
analysis reported in the present paper, we therefore regard
all trials of non-individualised homeopathic treatment as,
in effect, testing the same intervention. A study protocol
for this systematic review has been published [3].
Three of five prior comprehensive reviews of homeop-
athy RCTs, reflecting the broad spectrum of clinical condi-
tions that has been researched, reached the guarded
conclusion that the homeopathic intervention probably
differs from placebo [4–6]. The fourth such review con-
cluded, ‘The results of our meta-analysis are not compat-
ible with the hypothesis that the clinical effects of
homeopathy are completely due to placebo’ [7], though
the same authors later published supplementary analysis
that weakened this conclusion [8]. The fifth of these global
systematic reviews concluded there was “weak evidence
for a specific effect of homoeopathic remedies…compat-
ible with the notion that the clinical effects of homoeo-
pathy are placebo effects” [9]. In their approach, however,
each of these ‘global’ reviews has assessed collectively the
findings for individualised and non-individualised hom-
eopathy, a method we regard as inappropriate due to the
distinction between the two types of intervention in the
RCT context. There have been two systematic reviews,
with meta-analysis, of individualised homeopathy trials:
the first was published in 1998 [10], the most recent in
2014 [2]. A focused meta-analysis of non-individualised
homeopathy RCTs has not previously been reported.
In order to synthesise the findings from placebo-
controlled RCTs of non-individualised homeopathy we
conducted an up-to-date systematic review and meta-
analysis, testing the following null hypothesis: across the
entire range of clinical conditions that have been
researched, the main outcome of treatment using a non-
individualised homeopathic medicine cannot be distin-
guished from that using placebo. An additional aim,
further informing future research, was to quantify any
effect of non-individualised homeopathic treatment for
each clinical condition for which there is more than a
single eligible RCT.

Search strategy, data sources and trial eligibility
We conducted a systematic literature search to identify
RCTs that compared non-individualised homeopathy with
a placebo, for any clinical condition [11]. Each of the fol-
lowing electronic databases was searched from its incep-
tion up to the end of 2011, with updated searches of the
same databases up to the end of 2014: AMED; CAM-
Quest®; CINAHL; Cochrane Central Register of Con-
trolled Trials; Embase; Hom-Inform; LILACS; PubMed;
Science Citation Index and Scopus. For the update,
CORE-Hom® was also searched, using the term ‘random-
ised’ or ‘unknown’ in the Sequence Generation field.
The

(Cochrane Highly Sensitive Search Strategy) is given in our
previous paper [11]: “((homeopath* or homoeopath*) and

 trial [pt]) or (randomized [tiab]) or (placebo [tiab]) or (clin-
ical trials as topic [mesh:noexp]) or (randomly [tiab]) or
(trial [ti]))) not (animals [mh] not humans [mh])”.
As stated in our published protocol [3], we then ex-
cluded trials: of crossover design; of radionically prepared
homeopathic medicines; of homeopathic prophylaxis; of
homeopathy combined with other (complementary or
conventional) intervention; for other specified reasons.
The final explicit exclusion criterion was that there was
obviously no blinding of participants and practitioners to
the assigned intervention; for example, a trial described by
the original authors as ‘single [i.e. patient-] blinded’ was
automatically excluded. All remaining trials were eligible
for systematic review.
Outcome definitions
For each trial, and for the purposes of risk-of-bias as-
sessment and meta-analysis, we identified a single ‘main
outcome measure’ using a refinement of the approaches
adopted by Linde et al. [7] and by Shang et al. [9]. Each
trial’s ‘main outcome measure’ was identified based on
the following hierarchical ranking order (consistent with
the WHO International Classification of Functioning
(ICF) linked to health condition [12]):
� Mortality
� Morbidity
○ Treatment failure
○ Pathology; symptoms of disease
� Health impairment (loss/abnormality of function,
incl. presence of pain)
� Limitation of activity (disability, incl. days off work/
school because of ill health)
� Restriction of participation (quality of life)
� Surrogate outcome (e.g. blood test data, bone
mineral density).
We followed the WHO ICF system regardless of what
measure may have been identified by the investigators as
their ‘primary outcome’. In cases where, in the judgment
of the reviewers, there were two or more outcome mea-
sures of equal greatest importance within the WHO ICF
rank order, the designated ‘main outcome measure’ was
selected randomly from those two or more options using
the toss of coins or dice.
Unless otherwise indicated, the single end-point (mea-
sured from the start of the intervention) associated with the
designated ‘main outcome measure’ was taken as the last
follow-up at which data were reported for that outcome.
Data extraction
Two reviewers (RTM and either JC, JRTD, LL, SM, NR
or C-MM) identified the main outcome measure and
then independently extracted data for each trial using a
standard recording approach [3]. The data extracted per
trial included, as appropriate: demographics of partici-
pants (gender, age range, medical condition); study set-
ting; potency or potencies of homeopathic medicines;
whether a pilot trial; ‘main outcome measure’ (see
above) and measured end-point; funding source/s. The
statistical items noted were whether statistical power cal-
culation carried out; whether intention-to-treat (ITT)
analysis; sample size and missing data for each interven-
tion group. Discrepancies in the interpretation of data
were discussed and resolved by consensus.
Assessment of risk of bias
We used the domains of assessment as per the Cochrane
risk-of-bias appraisal tool [13]. The extracted information
enabled appraisal of freedom from risk of bias per domain:
‘Yes’ (low risk), ‘Unclear’ risk or ‘No’ (high risk). We ap-
plied this approach to each of the seven domains: se-
quence generation (domain I); allocation concealment
used to implement the random sequence (II); blinding of
participants and study personnel (IIIa); blinding of out-
come assessors (IIIb); incomplete outcome data (IV); se-
lective outcome reporting (V); other sources of bias (VI).
The source of any research sponsorship (i.e. potential for
vested interest) was taken into account for sub-group ana-
lysis (see below), but not in risk-of-bias assessment per se.
Reflecting appropriately the designated main outcome
measure, we rated risk of bias for each trial across all
seven domains and using the following classification [3]:
Rating A = Low risk of bias in all seven domains.
Rating Bx = Uncertain risk of bias in x domains; low
risk of bias in all other domains.
Rating Cy.x = High risk of bias in y domains; uncertain
risk of bias in x domains; low risk of bias in all other
domains.
Designating an RCT as ‘reliable evidence’
An ‘A’-rated trial was designated reliable evidence. We also
designated a ‘B1’-rated trial reliable evidence if the uncer-
tainty in its risk of bias was for one of domains IV, V or VI
only (i.e. it was required to be judged free of bias for each
of domains I, II, IIIA and IIIB) [3]; in tabulations and text
below, this rating is shown as ‘B1* (minimal risk of bias)’.
Study selection for meta-analysis
All RCTs that were included in the systematic review were
potentially eligible for meta-analysis. If the original RCT
paper did not provide adequate information on our se-
lected main outcome measure to enable calculation of the
SMD or the OR, we excluded the trial from the meta-
analysis, and described the outcome as ‘not estimable’;
consistent with Cochrane assessment criteria [13], such a
trial was thus attributed high risk of bias in domain V.

 Statistical analysis
Data preparation
For a continuous main outcome measure, the mean,
standard deviation (SD) and number of subjects were ex-
tracted for homeopathy and placebo groups and the un-
biased standardised mean difference (SMD) calculated, so
that a negative SMD reflected a difference in favour of
homeopathy. We did not adjust values to compensate for
any inter-group differences at baseline. For a dichotomous
main outcome measure, the number of subjects with a
favourable outcome and the total number of subjects in
each group were extracted to enable calculation of the
odds ratio (OR), with values greater than 1 reflecting a dif-
ference in favour of homeopathy.
For a given trial comprising more than two study
groups, only the data concerning comparisons between
non-individualised homeopathy and placebo were ex-
tracted from the paper. For a trial in which there were
two or more homeopathy groups, those groups’ data
were combined in analysis where relevant and feasible:
for a dichotomous measure, combining data merely re-
quired summing the events and sample sizes; for a con-
tinuous measure, combining data was feasible only
where SD was derivable1.
For the pooled meta-analysis, a single measure of ef-
fect size was required to enable pooling of all relevant
trials: ORs were transformed to SMD using a recognised
approximation method [14]. This is a deviation from the
protocol, which stated that SMD would be transformed
to OR, as in a previous paper [2]. SMD and OR are
equally valid statistics. The reasoning behind using SMD
instead of OR is that the latter is intuitively associated
with a dichotomous outcome, whereas the former has a
direct connection with ‘effect size’ and indicates that, for
the meta-analysis, it has been derived via transformation
from other measures (including OR). Whichever of these
two metrics is used, their results are interchangeable and
their interpretation is identical. ‘Effect size’ was inter-
preted as follows: SMD <0.40 = ‘small’; SMD 0.40 to
0.70 = ‘moderate’;
SMD
>0.70 = ‘large’
[14].
Via
the
SMD-to-OR transformation factor above [14], these
values correspond, respectively, to: OR <2.10 = ‘small’;
OR 2.10 to 3.60 = ‘moderate’; OR >3.60 = ‘large’
, which
we used for our previous paper [2].
Heterogeneity and publication bias
Due to the known clinical heterogeneity between stud-
ies, random-effects meta-analysis regression models [15]
were used to derive pooled estimators and for sub-group
/ moderator analyses. Estimates were derived along with
their 95% confidence intervals (CI) and p values. The I2
statistic was used to assess the variability between stud-
ies: it gives the percentage of the total variability in the
estimated effect size (which is composed of between-
study heterogeneity plus sampling variability) that is at-
tributable to heterogeneity. The I2 statistic can take
values between 0 and 100%: I2 = 0% means that all of the
heterogeneity is due to sampling error, and I2 = 100%
means that all variability is due to true heterogeneity be-
tween studies.
Funnel plots and Egger’s test of asymmetry [16, 17]
and the ‘trim-and-fill’ method [18, 19] were used to as-
sess the impact of publication bias.
All statistical analyses were carried out in R version
3.1.2 and using the meta package [20].
Sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analysis aimed to ascertain the impact of
trials’ risk-of-bias rating on the pooled SMD: we exam-
ined the effect of cumulatively removing data from the
meta-analysis by each trials’ rating, beginning with the
lowest ranked ‘C’-rated trial/s.
Sub-group analysis
Included in sub-group analysis was whether a trial: (a)
had been included or not in previous meta-analysis [9];
(b) was a ‘pilot’ study; (c) necessitated our use of im-
puted data for the meta-analysis; (d) was free of vested
interest; (e) investigated either an ‘acute’ or a ‘chronic’
clinical condition.
As was implicit in the study protocol [3], and as pre-
sented in a previous paper [2], we also included the follow-
ing in sub-group analysis: (f) whether a trial had sample
size that was greater or less than the median for those in-
cluded in meta-analysis; (g) whether a trial used homeo-
pathic medicine/s with potency ≥12C or <12C (12-times
serial dilution of 1:100 starting solution), a concentration
sometimes regarded as equivalent to the ‘Avogadro limit’
for molecular dose [21]; potency was defined as ‘mixed’ if a
combination medicine in a given trial comprised a mixture
of ≥12C and <12C potencies.
As recognised by Cochrane, some issues suitable for such
analysis are identified during the review process itself [22].
Thus, we additionally carried out sub-group analysis de-
pending on whether (h) a trial had investigated a combin-
ation, an OTC complex, an isopathic or a single remedy.
Disease-specific treatment effect of non-individualised
homeopathy
Analysis was carried out by clinical condition, in cases
where there were ≥2 RCTs with extractable main out-
come. Analysis was additionally carried out by category
of clinical condition, including each category for which
there were data from ≥2 RCTs. RCT nomenclature for
clinical conditions and their categories was previously
characterised [11]2.
All sub-group analyses were conducted before and
after removal of ‘C’-rated trials [2].

 Results
Included studies
The PRISMA flowchart from the original comprehen-
sive literature search (up to and including 2011) was
published previously [11]. An updated PRISMA flow-
chart is given in Fig. 1, identifying a total of 553
records.3 Four-hundred and fifty-four remained after
removal of duplicates. After excluding 95 due to type of
record (book chapter, thesis, abstract and other minor
article), Three-hundred and fifty-nine full-text records
were then assessed for eligibility. Two-hundred and
eighty-seven were excluded for the general reasons
summarised in Fig. 1; 38 of these same 287 were
excluded from the present systematic review for the
additionally specified reasons shown in Additional file
2.4 The finally remaining 72 records (75 RCTs) were
thus included in this systematic review; data were not
extractable from 21 of those, leaving 51 records (54
RCTs) available for meta-analysis—see Additional file 2
for details of the 21 records excluded from meta-
analysis.
Characteristics of included studies
The 75 RCTs represent 48 different clinical conditions
across 15 categories (Table 1). Each of 52 RCTs studied
a condition that was acute in nature; each of 23
studied a chronic condition. Homeopathic potency was
≥12C in 29 trials, and not exclusively ≥12C for 7 trials
(mix of >12C and <12C for 6 trials; unstated for 1
trial); potency was <12C in 39 trials. Seventeen trials
were free of vested interest; 24 trials were not free of
vested interest; 34 trials did not enable certainty in this
assessment.
Summary of findings
For each trial, Table 2 includes details of the sample size,
the identified main outcome measure (and whether di-
chotomous or continuous) and the study end-point.
Seventeen trials were described in the original paper as a
‘pilot’ (or ‘preliminary’ or ‘feasibility’) study. A power
calculation was carried out for 28 of the trials. ITT was
the basis for analysis in 21 trials. Mean attrition rate was
14.6%. The main outcome variable was dichotomous in
25 studies and continuous in the other 50. The total
sample size for the 54 meta-analysable trials was 5032;
the median sample size was 62.5 (inter-quartile range, 36
to 107). Meta-analysable studies included 45 different
main outcome measures and for an end-point that
ranged from 6 h to 6 months. Table 2 also indicates the
25 analysed trials in our study that we have in common
with those included in the meta-analysis data reported
by Shang et al. [9].

 Risk of bias and reliable evidence
Table 3 provides the risk-of-bias details for each of the
75 trials, and sub-divided by: (a) the 54 that could be in-
cluded in meta-analysis; (b) the 21 that could not be in-
cluded in meta-analysis. Domains IV (completeness of
outcome data), V (selective outcome reporting) and VI
(other sources of bias) presented the greatest method-
ological concerns. Sixteen of 30 trials that were high risk
of bias for domain V were so because their data were
not extractable for meta-analysis (see Study selection for
meta-analysis above). Domain II (allocation conceal-
ment) presented the most uncertain methodological
judgments, with 55 (73%) trials assessed unclear risk of
bias and only 14 (19%) low risk of bias.
There were three trials with reliable evidence (two
‘A’-rated, one ‘B1*’-rated), 23 with uncertain risk of
bias (‘B’-rated), and 49 with high risk of bias (‘C’-
rated). A summary risk-of-bias bar-graph is shown in
Additional file 3.
Table 3a (54 trials included in meta-analysis): Two
trials were ‘A’-rated (low risk of bias)—i.e. they ful-
filled the criteria for all seven domains of assess-
ment. Our criteria for reliable evidence were also
satisfied for one ‘B1*’-rated trial. Table 3a therefore
includes three trials that were classed reliable evi-
dence:
Plumbum
metallicum
for
lead
poisoning
(A103:
Padilha);
the
OTC
complex
Acthéane
for
menopausal syndrome (A272: Colau); the OTC com-
plex
Traumeel
S
for
post-operative
pain
(A120:
Singer). Each of the other 51 trials had uncertain or
high risk of bias in important methodological as-
pects, and may be regarded as non-reliable evidence:
23 trials were classed as uncertain risk of bias; 28
were classed as high risk of bias.
Table 3b (21 trials excluded from meta-analysis):
All of these 21 trials are ‘C’-rated (high risk of bias).
Thirteen of the 21 were seriously flawed in more than
one domain of assessment (i.e. rated ‘C2.0’ or worse).

 Seven of the remaining eight trials were ‘C’-rated
solely because of data extraction issues: only one of
those seven (A80: Jacobs) fulfilled ‘low risk-of-bias’
criteria for all other domains of assessment, and so
would
otherwise
have
been
designated
reliable
evidence.
Meta-analysis
The pooled SMD (random-effects model) for all 54 trials
was –0.33 (95% CI –0.44, –0.21; p < 0.001)—see Fig. 2.
The original data extracted per trial (continuous or di-
chotomous), together with the correspondingly calculated
SMD or OR, are illustrated in Additional files 4a and b.

 Of the 31 trials with continuous data, 9 had an effect sta-
tistically significantly favouring homeopathy (i.e. SMD < 0,
with p ≤ 0.05); no trials had an effect significantly favouring
placebo. The pooled effect estimate was SMD = –0.36 (95%
CI –0.52, –0.19; p < 0.001). Of the 23 trials with dichotom-
ous data, 6 had an effect statistically significantly favouring
homeopathy (i.e. OR > 1, with p ≤ 0.05); no trials had an ef-
fect significantly favouring placebo. The pooled effect esti-
mate was OR = 1.67 (95% CI 1.25, 2.23; p < 0.001).
Heterogeneity and publication bias
The statistical heterogeneity among the studies was high
(I2 = 65%) – Fig. 2.
Evidence of publication bias, toward studies favouring
homeopathy, was apparent from the funnel plot (Fig. 3a),
which suggested a relative absence of studies favouring
placebo. Egger’s test of asymmetry confirmed significant
evidence of asymmetry in the funnel plot, p = 0.002. The
estimated number of ‘missing’ studies was 11 (p for at
least one ‘missing’ study was <0.001) – Fig. 3b. The
effect estimate was attenuated when using the ‘trim-and-
fill’ method to adjust for publication bias: after adjustment
for ‘missing’ studies, the pooled effect estimate was –0.16
(95% CI –0.31, –0.02; p = 0.023); the statistical heterogeneity
among the studies remained high (I2 = 79%).
Risk of bias and reliable evidence
Figure 4 shows the SMD data for all 54 analysable trials,
grouped by their risk of bias (high; uncertain; minimal
or low [reliable evidence]).

There

statistical
evidence that effect estimates significantly differed
depending on whether the body of evidence for a meta-
analysis consisted of ‘low’
, ‘uncertain’ or ‘high’ risk-of-
bias studies.
Sensitivity analysis
Figure 5 shows the effect of cumulatively removing data
by trials’ risk-of-bias rating. The pooled SMD showed a
statistically significant effect in favour of homeopathy for
all trials collectively, through to and including those rated
‘B3’; for the highest-rated trials collectively (‘B2’
, ‘B1’ and
‘reliable evidence’), the pooled SMD still favoured hom-
eopathy but was no longer statistically significant.
Sub-group analyses
The pooled SMD favoured homeopathy for all sub-
groups, though it was statistically non-significant for two
of the 18 (data imputed; combination medicine): Fig. 6a. A
meta-regression was performed to test specifically for
within-group differences for each sub-group. The results
showed that there were no significant differences between
studies that were and were not: included in previous
meta-analyses (p = 0.447); pilot studies (p = 0.316); greater
than the median sample (p = 0.298); potency ≥ 12C (p =
0.221); imputed for meta-analysis (p = 0.384); free from
vested interest (p = 0.391); acute/chronic (p = 0.796); dif-
ferent types of homeopathy (p = 0.217).
After removal of ‘C’-rated trials (Fig. 6b), the pooled
SMD still favoured homeopathy for all sub-groups, but
was statistically non-significant for 10 of the 18 (included
in previous meta-analysis; pilot study; sample size > me-
dian; potency ≥12C; data imputed; free of vested interest;
not free of vested interest; combination medicine; single
medicine; chronic condition). There remained no signifi-
cant differences between sub-groups—with the exception
of the analysis for sample size > median (p = 0.028).

 Analysis by clinical condition
Clinical conditions Meta-analysis was possible for eight
clinical conditions, each analysis comprising two to five
trials (Fig. 7a). A statistically significant pooled SMD,
favouring homeopathy, was observed for influenza (N = 2),
irritable bowel syndrome (N = 2), and seasonal allergic
rhinitis (N = 5). Each of the other five clinical condi-
tions (allergic asthma, arsenic toxicity, infertility due to
amenorrhoea, muscle soreness, post-operative pain)
showed non-significant findings. Removal of ‘C’-rated
trials negated the statistically significant effect for sea-
sonal allergic rhinitis and left the non-significant effect
for post-operative pain unchanged (Fig. 7b); no higher-
rated trials were available for additional analysis of ar-
senic toxicity, infertility due to amenorrhoea or irritable
bowel syndrome. There were no ‘C’-rated trials to re-
move for allergic asthma, influenza, or muscle soreness.
Thus, influenza was the only clinical condition for
which higher-rated trials indicated a statistically signifi-
cant effect; neither of its contributing trials, however,
comprised reliable evidence.
Categories of clinical condition
Meta-analysis was possible for 11 categories of clinical
condition, each analysis comprising two to ten trials
(Fig.
8a).

 favouring homeopathy, was observed for five categories:
allergy
and asthma
(N = 10); cardiovascular
(N = 2);
dermatology (N = 2); ear nose and throat (N = 3); gastro-
enterology (N = 2). None of the trials designated reliable
evidence featured in any of these five categories. Each of
the other six categories showed non-significant findings.
Removal of ‘C’-rated trials limited each analysis to two
to five trials (Fig. 8b): statistically significant effects were
marginally retained for allergy and asthma (N = 5) and
dermatology (N = 2), and more clearly retained for ear
nose and throat (N = 2). No higher-rated trials were
available for additional analysis in the cardiovascular and
gastroenterology categories. After removal of ‘C’-rated
trials, there was no change in the non-significance of the
statistical findings for each of the other six categories.
Discussion
Seventy-two of the 75 eligible trials had uncertain or
high risk of bias. Due to poor reporting or other defi-
ciencies in 21 of the original papers, data extraction for
our meta-analysis was possible from only 54 of the 75
trials. Trials with high and with uncertain risk of bias
each featured similarly in our 54-trial analysis; the qual-
ity of the body of analysed evidence is therefore low.
As previously recognised [2, 7, 9], the pooling of data
from diverse clinical conditions, outcome measures and
end-points has obvious limitations: thus, a given pooled
effect estimate here does not have a clear numerical
meaning or relative clinical value, but provides a reason-
able summary measure in evaluating the average effect
of a medical intervention. Our null hypothesis that
regards each trial of non-individualised homeopathy as
testing the same intervention also has its limitations, for
it makes the debatable assumption that each homeo-
pathic medicine has similar lack of efficacy for the rele-
vant symptoms of every clinical condition. Nevertheless,
our separate focus on individualised [2] and non-
individualised homeopathy marks a clear and appropri-
ate step forward.
For our previous meta-analysis of RCTs (on individua-
lised homeopathy [2]), the three most highly ranked tri-
als had minimal risk of bias and were designated reliable
evidence. In the current study, we have identified two
trials with the highest-quality ranking (‘A’ = low risk of
bias), plus one with minimal risk of bias (‘B1*’), which
we have examined collectively as the reliable evidence of
RCTs
of
non-individualised
homeopathic
treatment.
Analysis of these three highest-quality trials showed a
statistically non-significant pooled SMD of –0.18 (95%
CI
–0.46,
0.09)
(equivalent
to
pooled
OR = 1.39,
using the standard conversion [14]). This effect estimate
of –0.18 contrasts with that for all 54 analysable trials
of –0.33 (equivalent to OR = 1.82): the latter represents
a small and statistically significant treatment effect
favouring homeopathy, akin to our pooled findings
for the individualised trials [2]. We therefore reject
the null hypothesis (non-individualised homeopathy is
indistinguishable from placebo) on the basis of pooling all
studies, but fail to reject the null hypothesis on the basis
of the reliable evidence only. Our risk-of-bias analysis
and the meta-regression, however, indicate that effect
estimates do not significantly differ depending on
whether the meta-analysis consists of ‘low’
, ‘uncertain’
or ‘high’ risk-of-bias studies.
Lack of clear conclusion above might simply be due to
there being too few high-quality trials. With only three

 studies that can be classified as reliable evidence, it is
difficult to separate an effect of homeopathy from the ef-
fect of poor quality. The three studies comprising ‘reli-

Traumeel S for post-operative pain ([25]; null effect).
Since the completion of our defined literature search, we
are aware of recently published and potentially eligible
RCT papers, whose findings we have yet to explore
[26–29]. The limit of detecting an effect of non-
individualised homeopathy across all trials may be re-
lated to a medicine’s degree of dilution, since trials using
potency ≥12C failed to show a statistically significant
pooled effect that favoured homeopathy (see Fig. 6b).

 In attempting to formulate a reasonable overarching
conclusion, it is important also to highlight other findings
from our quality-based analyses. For example, the sensitiv-
ity analysis that consecutively excluded the lowest-quality
trials showed that studies with lower quality tended to re-
port greater benefits of non-individualised homeopathic
intervention than studies with higher quality. That RCTs
with a higher risk of bias showed a greater benefit for the
homeopathy group supports some previous—though not
our own [2]—meta-analysis findings [4, 7, 10]. Our funnel
plot finding of larger effect estimates (in favour of hom-
eopathy) in trials with lower sample size is consistent with
observations from RCTs in medicine more widely [30]. A
further perspective, based on our trim-and-fill analysis, is
that the true pooled effect estimate is likely to be smaller
than initially appreciated: we found evidence of publica-
tion bias, with an estimated 11 ‘missing’ studies whose re-
sults would favour placebo, adjustment for which yielded
an attenuated but still-significant pooled effect estimate of
–0.16 for the 54 analysable trials. We are also aware that
our analysis reflects per-protocol—not the potentially
more robust (but less available) ITT—outcome data,
which might have slightly magnified our pooled effect
estimate; however, we have addressed the possible im-
pact of incomplete data in rigorous risk-of-bias assess-
ments, as recommended by Cochrane [31]. The sum of
these comments supports a generalised conclusion that
a non-individualised homeopathic medicine is indistin-
guishable from a placebo, but the quality of the evi-
dence is low.

 A small and erratic treatment effect in this context
may be consistent with the notion that a pre-selected
homeopathic medicine, aiming to treat the typical symp-
toms of a clinical condition, and given to all of the rele-
vant trial participants, may match sub-optimally the
‘total symptom picture’ for an important number of
them, leading potentially to diminished efficacy. The
quality of the clinical intervention and the suitability of
the main outcome measure are the key facets of a trial’s
model validity, i.e. the extent to which a study reflects
best clinical practice in that intervention [32]. Thus, to
complete the quality evaluation of homeopathy trials, it
is important to accommodate also the assessment of
their model validity, emphasising in this case the three
trials comprising reliable evidence in non-individualised
homeopathic treatment.
We report separately our model validity assessments
of these trials5, evaluating consequently their overall
quality based on a GRADE-like principle of ‘downgrad-
ing’ [14]: two trials [23, 25] rated here as reliable evi-
dence were downgraded to ‘low quality’ overall due to
the inadequacy of their model validity; the remaining
trial with reliable evidence [24] was judged to have ad-
equate model validity. The latter study [24] thus com-
prises the sole RCT that can be designated ‘high quality’
overall by our approach5, a stark finding that reveals fur-
ther important aspects of the preponderantly low quality
of the current body of evidence in non-individualised
homeopathy.
Analysis by clinical condition, and following removal
of ‘C’-rated studies, showed a statistically significant
treatment effect in RCTs of non-individualised homeo-
pathy for influenza, and in the categories allergy and
asthma, dermatology, and ear nose and throat. None of
these analyses included any reliable evidence, however.
While these clinical categories do not provide compel-
ling evidence for non-individualised homeopathic treat-
ment, they may contain the most promising targets for
future research.
Conclusions
There was a small, statistically significant, effect of non-
individualised
homeopathic
treatment.
However,
the
finding was not robust to sensitivity analysis based solely
on the three trials that comprised reliable evidence: the
effect size estimate collectively for those three trials was
not statistically significant. There was significant evi-
dence of publication bias in favour of homeopathy. Our
meta-analysis of the current reliable evidence base there-
fore fails to reject the null hypothesis that the outcome
of treatment using a non-individualised homeopathic
medicine is not distinguishable from that using placebo.
Nevertheless, the risk-of-bias analysis and the meta-
regression, together with the large preponderance of
low-quality evidence, challenge the inference that effect
size estimates differ significantly depending on risk-of-
bias rating. The assessment of a trial’s model validity
should also be taken into account in an evaluation of
overall study quality in homeopathy. Reliable evidence is
lacking for all clinical conditions whose data have enabled
separate meta-analysis. Higher-quality RCT research on
specified homeopathic medicines is required to enable
more decisive interpretation regarding efficacy for given
clinical symptoms or conditions. Future trialists need to
minimise their studies’ risk of bias in all domains, and to
improve the clarity of their reporting. Such research might
wisely focus on trial design in which only patients that
match the relevant ‘symptom picture’ or match the indica-
tions of the selected homeopathic product are those eligible
to participate: large trials are therefore indicated.
