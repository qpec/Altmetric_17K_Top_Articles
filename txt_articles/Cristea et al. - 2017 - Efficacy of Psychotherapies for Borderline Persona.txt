IMPORTANCE Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a debilitating condition, but several
psychotherapies are considered effective.
OBJECTIVE To conduct an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized
clinical trials to assess the efficacy of psychotherapies for BPD populations.
DATA SOURCES Search terms were combined for borderline personality and randomized trials
in PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (from
database inception to November 2015), as well as the reference lists of earlier meta-analyses.
STUDY SELECTION Included were randomized clinical trials of adults with diagnosed BPD
randomized to psychotherapy exclusively or to a control intervention. Study selection
differentiated stand-alone designs (in which an independent psychotherapy was compared
with control interventions) from add-on designs (in which an experimental intervention
added to usual treatment was compared with usual treatment alone).
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data extraction coded characteristics of trials, participants,
and interventions and assessed risk of bias using 4 domains of the Cochrane Collaboration Risk
of Bias tool (independent extraction by 2 assessors). Outcomes were pooled using a
random-effects model. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were conducted.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Standardized mean differences (Hedges g) were calculated
using all outcomes reported in the trials for borderline symptoms, self-harm, suicide, health
service use, and general psychopathology at posttest and follow-up. Differential treatment
retention at posttest was analyzed, reporting odds ratios.
RESULTS Thirty-three trials (2256 participants) were included. For borderline-relevant
outcomes combined (symptoms, self-harm, and suicide) at posttest, the investigated
psychotherapies were moderately more effective than control interventions in stand-alone
designs (g = 0.32; 95% CI, 0.14-0.51) and add-on designs (g = 0.40; 95% CI, 0.15-0.65).
Results were similar for other outcomes, including stand-alone designs: self-harm (g = 0.32;
95% CI, 0.09-0.54), suicide (g = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.15-0.74), health service use (g = 0.40; 95%
CI, 0.22-0.58), and general psychopathology (g=0.32; 95% CI, 0.09-0.55), with no
differences between design types. There were no significant differences in the odds ratios for
treatment retention (1.32; 95% CI, 0.87-2.00 for stand-alone designs and 1.01; 95% CI,
0.55-1.87 for add-on designs). Thirteen trials reported borderline-relevant outcomes at
follow-up (g = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.15-0.75). Dialectical behavior therapy (g=0.34; 95% CI,
0.15-0.53) and psychodynamic approaches (g=0.41; 95% CI, 0.12-0.69) were the only types
of psychotherapies more effective than control interventions. Risk of bias was a significant
moderator in subgroup and meta-regression analyses (slope β = −0.16; 95% CI, −0.29 to
−0.03; P = .02). Publication bias was persistent, particularly for follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Psychotherapies, most notably dialectical behavior therapy
and psychodynamic approaches, are effective for borderline symptoms and related
problems. Nonetheless, effects are small, inflated by risk of bias and publication bias, and
particularly unstable at follow-up.

B
orderline personality disorder (BPD) is a debilitating
mental disorder characterized by severe instability in
affect, identity, interpersonal relationships, and behav-
ioral dysregulation.1 Alongside a vast array of comorbidities,
parasuicide (ie, nonlethal intentional self-harming behav-
iors)andsuicidearecommonlyassociatedproblems.Morethan
75% of patients with BPD are believed to engage in deliberate
self-harm.2 Suicide rates are estimated to be between 8% and
10%,3,4almost50timeshigherthaninthegeneralpopulation.5
Borderline personality disorder is the most common person-
ality disorder in clinical populations,5,6 associated with inten-
sive use of mental health services7,8 even in the absence of a
full diagnosis.9 Functional impairment is considerable com-
pared with other personality disorders10 and is enduring in the
absence of a change in personality psychopathology.11
Several psychotherapy approaches were specifically de-
veloped for the disorder, most notably dialectical behavior
therapy (DBT),12 cognitive behavior therapy (CBT),13 and psy-
chodynamictreatments,suchasmentalization-basedtherapy14
or transference-focused psychotherapy.15 Each approach ap-
peared to be more effective than treatment as usual (TAU) for
BPD-related problems, such as suicidality or parasuicidal
behavior.16-19TrialsofdirectcomparisonsoftreatmentsforBPD
reportedfewdifferencesamongthem.20,21However,mosttrials
demonstrating effectiveness were conducted with the direct
participation of the treatment developer. Previous meta-
analyses of psychotherapeutic treatments for BPD have been
scarce and used focused criteria for assessing effectiveness,
avoiding combining treatments. One meta-analysis22 of DBT
for BPD reported moderate effects for borderline-relevant out-
comes, suicidality, and self-harm. However, analysis re-
stricted to randomized clinical trials (RCTs) showed reduced
effects, with nonsignificance for suicidality and self-harm. An-
other meta-analysis23 of RCTs for BPD reported only moder-
ate effects for the comparison between DBT and TAU.
Conversely, because effectiveness differences between
therapies appear to be limited and because variations of the
same intervention are to be expected in diverse implementa-
tion settings, we believe that a broader effectiveness evalua-
tion grouping therapies into theoretically intelligible catego-
ries is germane. Heterogeneity, publication bias, and potential
moderators of efficacy (eg, treatment duration and type of psy-
chotherapy) are additional unclear issues. Moreover, because
the study collection dates of the 2 previous meta-analyses22,23
preceded 2012, new trials or follow-ups of older trials pub-
lished since then should be considered. Therefore, our objec-
tive was to conduct an updated systematic review and meta-
analysis of RCTs to assess the efficacy of psychotherapies
for BPD-relevant outcomes at posttest and, where possible, at
follow-up.
Methods
Identification and Selection of Studies
Studies were identified through searches in 4 bibliographical
databases (from database inception to November 2015 in
PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Reg-
ister of Controlled Trials) using the search term borderline
personality (both text word and Medical Subject Headings
term), with a filter for randomized trials (eMethods in the
Supplement). We also checked the reference lists of earlier
meta-analyses.22,23
Studies were included if they were RCTs in which a psy-
chotherapy was compared with a control condition for adults
diagnosed as having BPD. Given the diversity and complexity
of therapy orientations, we used an inclusive approach in
delineating the psychotherapy and control conditions. We
used a customary definition of psychotherapy emphasizing
verbal communication, structured and purposeful therapist-
patient encounters, and the establishment of a therapeutic
relationship.24,25 No constraints were placed on the control
group, which could include (but was not restricted to) TAU or
other treatments not specifically developed for BPD. Compari-
sons between 2 different psychotherapies specifically devel-
oped for BPD (ie, DBT and transference-focused psycho-
therapy)orbetweenformsofthesamepsychotherapy(eg,DBT
vs its skills training component) were excluded because of ex-
pectationsofsimilarefficacy.Concomitantmedicationusewas
not an exclusion criterion unless it was prescribed in a stan-
dardized way, as in trials in which individuals were random-
ized to a combination of psychotherapy and either pharma-
cotherapy or placebo. Medication use followed a systematic
protocol, and we could not disentangle its effects from those
ofpsychotherapy.Studiesonevenpartiallyadolescentsamples
were excluded because BPD diagnosis and treatment pose dis-
tinct challenges for this group. No language restrictions were
applied. One researcher (I.A.C.) screened all records, and full
texts were obtained for RCTs. Two independent assessors
(I.A.C. and C.D.C.) examined the full texts and selected eli-
gible RCTs.
Risk of Bias and Data Extraction
Trial risk of bias (RoB) was evaluated within 4 domains of the
Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool,26 which assesses
sources of bias in RCTs. Rated domains included (1) adequate
Key Points
Question What is the efficacy of psychotherapy for borderline
personality disorder?
Findings In this systematic review and meta-analysis of
randomized clinical trials, outcomes of psychotherapies (most
notably dialectical behavior therapy and psychodynamic
approaches) significantly improved borderline-relevant outcomes
(symptoms, self-harm, and suicide) compared with control
interventions. However, differences dissipated in well-designed
and implemented trials or if the control group was balanced for
manualization of treatment or the involvement of the study team
in treatment.
Meaning Psychotherapies specifically designed for borderline
personality disorder have significant yet modest benefits over
treatment as usual, and future independent and well-conducted
trials are needed to clarify the stability and practical relevance of
their effects.

generation of allocation sequence, (2) concealment of alloca-
tion to conditions, (3) prevention of knowledge of the allo-
cated intervention to assessors of outcome (masking of asses-
sors), and (4) dealing with incomplete data. This last domain
was assessed as low risk if proper intent-to-treat (ITT) analy-
ses were conducted, meaning that authors used a method for
imputing missing values so that all randomized participants
were included in the analyses. Masking of assessors was rated
as low risk if the trial described proper methods of ensuring
masking or if all relevant outcome measures were self-report
instruments, thus not requiring the direct interaction with an
assessor. For use in meta-regression analyses, we computed
an overall RoB score for each study by awarding 1 point for each
bias source rated as low risk.
Among trials, we distinguished between stand-alone de-
signs (in which the experimental group received a full course
of an independent BPD psychotherapy and the control group
received TAU or another therapy not specific for BPD) and
add-on designs (in which both groups received TAU and the
experimental group received an additional BPD therapy). We
also extracted characteristics of the participants, interven-
tions, and studies, including therapy type (DBT, psychody-
namic, CBT, or other); control group (TAU, supportive therapy,
or an ad hoc control, designed as part of the trial); whether the
control group was manualized (ie, followed a treatment pro-
tocol or manual); involvement or noninvolvement of the study
team in treating the control group; the presence or absence of
a treatment developer as an author of the trial report; thera-
pist supervision for the experimental group (by the treat-
ment developer or by others); and low RoB (studies rated as
low risk for ≤2 vs ≥3 RoB domains). We also extracted the fol-
lowing treatment intensity variables: treatment duration (in
months), treatment exposure (in hours, calculated by multi-
plying the session duration for individual or group therapy by
the number of sessions either planned or, if available,
attended on average for the experimental and control
groups), and difference in treatment exposure between the
intervention and control groups (in hours). Risk of bias
assessment and data extraction were performed by 2 inde-
pendent assessors. Interrater agreement κ statistics were
computed (eMethods in the Supplement), and disagreement
was resolved by discussion among assessors and with the
senior author (P.C.).
Meta-analysis
To capture the breadth and variability of reported outcomes,
we grouped them into the following categories: borderline rel-
evant(BPDsymptommeasures,self-harmandparasuicide,and
suicidal behaviors), borderline symptoms (only BPD symp-
tom measures), self-harm and parasuicidal behavior, suicidal
behavior, health service use (hospitalizations [whether psy-
chiatric or general], use of emergency services, use of addi-
tional outpatient services, and medication use), and general
psychopathology (general psychopathology, anxiety, or de-
pression). Treatment retention was computed as the compara-
tivedropoutratesbetweentheinterventionandcontrolgroups.
Dropouts (eMethods in the Supplement) were defined as all
randomized participants not finishing treatment, regardless
ofthereasons.Adverseeffectsweredefinedasparticipantdeath
by suicide and as death from any cause after randomization.
The between-group effect size was calculated as the dif-
ference between the intervention and control groups at post-
test and at follow-up (Hedges g), corrected for small sample
sizes.27 Follow-up data more than 2 years from treatment ter-
mination or in which the control group also received the ex-
perimental treatment were not included. Data across mul-
tiple follow-up points were averaged at the study level for each
outcome category. For treatment retention, odds ratios indi-
cated the odds of maintaining participants in treatment in the
intervention group vs the control group.
If a trial reported data on multiple outcomes in the same
category, the mean effect size was calculated using the pro-
cedures by Borenstein et al28 so that each trial reported just
one effect size in a category at each time point. Where avail-
able, the means (SDs) were used, but if only dichotomous out-
comes were reported, we used available procedures28 to com-
pute the standardized mean difference. If a study did not
include sufficient data for effect size calculation, the authors
were contacted, and the study was excluded if they failed to
provide data. Where available, ITT data were preferred.
Effect sizes for dichotomous outcomes were computed,
adhering to the ITT principle, by reporting the observed or
imputed number of patients with an event (eg, self-harm)
relative to the total number of patients randomized to that
group.
We used a software program (Comprehensive Meta-
Analysis, version 3; Biostat) for computing and pooling effect
sizes, with a random-effects model for pooling effect sizes. We
calculated the number needed to treat using the formulas by
Kraemer and Kupfer.29 Heterogeneity was assessed with the
I2statistic:0%indicatesnoobservedheterogeneity,andhigher
values indicate increasing heterogeneity, with 25%, 50%, and
75% defining thresholds for low, moderate, and high. We cal-
culated 95% CIs around I2 statistics30 using a noncentral χ2-
based approach (heterogi module for Stata, version 8; Stata-
Corp LP).31 Outliers were defined as studies in which the 95%
CI was outside the 95% CI of the pooled studies (on both sides).
For categorical moderators, we conducted subgroup analy-
ses using a mixed-effects model.28 For continuous modera-
tors, meta-regression analyses used a restricted maximum
likelihood model with the Knapp-Hartung method.28 We ex-
amined publication bias through visual funnel plot inspec-
tion, the trim-and-fill procedure32 (which produces an effect
size estimate after accounting for publication bias), and
Egger test for funnel plot asymmetry.
Results
Selection and Inclusion of Studies
We screened 1058 abstracts, removed 500 duplicates, and sub-
sequently retrieved 158 full-text articles. Thirty-eight trials ex-
amined a psychotherapy, with 5 excluded for comparing 2
versions of the same therapy. Consequently, 33 trials (2256
participants) met our inclusion criteria, and 28 of them
had enough data for calculating effect sizes (eFigure 1 in the

contacted, but they did not provide the requested data.
Characteristics of Included Studies
The33trialsincluded1169participantsintheinvestigatedtreat-
ment group and 1087 participants in the control group (eTable
1 in the Supplement). Seventeen trials targeted patients with
BPD diagnosed using a structured clinical interview, 10 trials
targeted patients with BPD with recent documented self-
harm, and the rest targeted special BPD populations (eg, vet-
erans and individuals with addiction). Twenty-two trials had
astand-alonedesign,and11trialshadanadd-ondesign.Twelve
trials had women-only samples, and this percentage ranged
from 0% to 95% in the remainder. The best-represented ap-
proaches were DBT (12 trials), psychodynamic therapies (8
trials), and CBT (5 trials). Twenty-one trials had TAU as the con-
trol treatment, and the control treatment was manualized in
10 trials. The treatment developer was an author in 20 trials.
In 15 trials, the treatment developer was a therapist or super-
vised therapists directly. Treatment duration ranged from 2.5
to 24 months, and the number of sessions (for individual and
group therapy taken together) ranged from 6 to 312.
TheκstatisticsindicatedhighinterrateragreementforRoB
estimations (eMethods in the Supplement), which were vari-
able (eFigure 2 in the Supplement). Sixteen trials reported ad-
equate sequence generation, 12 trials properly concealed al-
location, and 20 trials implemented masking of outcome
assessors (2 used self-report measures only). However, for in-
complete outcome data, only 13 trials were rated as low RoB,
and more than half had high RoB. Eleven trials could be rated
as low risk on 3 or 4 domains.
Main Effects at Posttest
Stand-alone Designs
Results showed significant effects for all outcome categories,
ranging from 0.31 (0.04-0.57) for borderline symptoms to 0.44
(0.15-0.74) for suicide outcomes (Table 1). Heterogeneity was
moderate to high with the exception of health service use. For
all borderline-relevant outcomes (eFigure 3 in the Supple-
ment), 17 trials had a Hedges g of 0.32 (95% CI, 0.14-0.51), with
moderate heterogeneity (48%).
Add-on Designs
For borderline-relevant outcomes (Table 1 and eFigure 3 in the
Supplement), 10 trials had a Hedges g of 0.40 (95% CI, 0.15-
0.65), with moderate heterogeneity (50%). Results were not
significantforself-harmandparasuicidalbehaviororforhealth
service use, but the number of trials was small (range, 3-6).

parasuicidal behavior, and suicide) yielded a significant ef-
fect (g = 0.35; 95% CI, 0.20-0.50 [27 trials]), with moderate
heterogeneity (48%) (Table 2 and Figure). Results with outli-
ersexcludedorexcludingcomparisonswithsupportivetherapy
were similar.
For treatment retention, results were not significant for
stand-alone designs (odds ratio, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.87-2.00 [15
trials]) or add-on designs (odds ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.55-1.87
[10 trials]), and heterogeneity was moderate to high (59%
for stand-alone designs and 44% for add-on designs). There
were no significant differences between the 2 design types
on any of the symptom outcome categories or on treatment
retention.
Main Effects at Follow-up
Adverse Effects
There were 2 deaths by suicide in the treatment group and 5
deaths by suicide in the control group. The treatment group
and the control group each had 6 all-cause deaths.
Stand-alone Designs
Seven trials had a significant effect of 0.56 (95% CI, 0.17-
0.95) for all borderline-relevant outcomes (Table 1). Hetero-
geneity was high (62%). The number of trials was too small
(range, 3-5) for the other outcome categories.
Add-on Designs
Six trials had a nonsignificant effect (g = 0.35; 95% CI, −0.15
to 0.85) for all borderline-relevant outcomes (Table 1). Hetero-
geneity was high (79%). There were too few trials (range, 2-5)
in the other outcome categories.
All Trials
Combining both design types yielded a significant effect
(g = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.15-0.75 [13 trials]), with high heteroge-
neity (70%). These results are summarized in Table 2 and in
eFigure 4 in the Supplement.
Subgroup and Meta-regression Analyses
Subgroup Analyses
These analyses were conducted on the most inclusive out-
come category (all borderline-relevant outcomes), combin-
ing stand-alone and add-on designs because we found no
differences among them (Table 2 and eTable 2 in the
Supplement). The DBT (g=0.34; 95% CI, 0.15-0.53 [9 trials])
and psychodynamic approaches (g=0.41; 95% CI, 0.12-0.69
[7 trials]) were more effective than control interventions,
while CBT (g = 0.24; 95% CI, −0.01 to 0.49 [5 trials]) and
other interventions (g = 0.38; 95% CI, −0.15 to 0.92 [6
trials]) were not.
Trials with an ad hoc control group developed as part of
the study, trials in which the control intervention was manu-
alized, or trials in which the study team was involved in treat-
ing the control group, as well trials with low RoB for 3 or 4
domains,generatednonsignificantbetween-groupeffects.Psy-
chotherapies were more effective than control interventions
in trials with more RoB than in those with less RoB (0.48 vs
0.11, P = .01).
Meta-regression Analyses
Risk of bias (the number of criteria with low RoB) had a sig-
nificant negative association with outcomes at posttest
(slope β = −0.16; 95% CI, −0.29 to −0.03; P = .02) (eFigure 5
in the Supplement). Dropout rates in the treatment group,
treatment duration, treatment exposure in the treatment
group or the control group, and difference in treatment
exposure between groups were not significantly related to
outcomes.
Publication Bias
Inspection of the funnel plot and the trim-and-fill procedure
documented publication bias for borderline-relevant out-
comes (eFigure 6 in the Supplement). At posttest, consider-
ing all trials, adjustment for missing studies (n = 6) decreased
the effect size from a Hedges g of 0.35 (95% CI, 0.20-0.50) to
0.23 (95% CI, 0.07-0.38). For stand-alone designs, 4 studies
were imputed, leading to a smaller but significant Hedges g of
0.20 (95% CI, 0.01-0.39). For add-on designs, 2 studies were
imputed, resulting in a Hedges g of 0.30 (95% CI, 0.05-0.56).
Egger test was not significant in any of these cases. At follow-
up, considering all trials, adjustment for missing studies (n = 3)
led to a nonsignificant Hedges g of 0.19 (95% CI, −0.15 to 0.53),
and Egger test was significant (intercept β = 2.78; 95% CI, 0.18-
5.39; P = .04).
Discussion
We conducted an updated systematic review and meta-
analysis of RCTs of psychotherapies for BPD. We included 33
trials, either stand-alone designs (an independent experimen-
tal treatment vs TAU or another control) or add-on designs (an
experimental treatment superimposed to TAU vs TAU alone).
Weexamineddisorder-specificoutcomes(BPDsymptoms,self-
harm and parasuicide, and suicide) and more general out-
comes, such as psychopathology or health service use. Most
trials(22of33)hadstand-alonedesigns,andourresultsshowed
significant, small, posttest between-group effect sizes, with
high to moderate heterogeneity across all outcome catego-
ries. Results were more variable for add-on designs, includ-
ing nonsignificant effects. Nonetheless, the number of trials
for some outcome categories was small, and these findings
should be viewed as tentative and possibly spurious. How-
ever, for borderline-relevant outcomes and psychopathology
(for which most add-on trials included measures), effects were
small to medium. We operated with this design distinction so
as not to confound more intensive psychotherapeutic treat-
ments with others designed to complement usual treatment,
although subsequent subgroup analysis found no difference
between the 2 design types on any of the outcome categories.
We also found no differences between types of psychothera-
pies. Most trials focused on DBT followed by psychodynamic
approaches, and both types generated significant, small
between-group effect sizes, with low heterogeneity for DBT.
Surprisingly, CBT was not superior to control conditions. Al-
though this result was based on only 5 trials, heterogeneity
was low.

nonsignificant results for add-on designs. Heterogeneity was
high, reflecting substantial differences in follow-up duration
and type among trials, with some being naturalistic and oth-

years after treatment termination because a longer time span
increases the risk of biasing effects from factors extraneous to
the intervention. Adverse effects were rare in both the experi-
mental and control treatment groups.
A surprising finding regarded treatment retention, for
which we found no significant differences between the ex-
perimental treatment and control groups. This result re-
mained stable for both design types and showed moderate
heterogeneity. Improving treatment retention has generally

been seen as a substantial advantage of psychotherapies for
BPD, and most trials in general have demonstrated very favor-
able evaluations. This discrepancy might stem from the fact
that individual trials used variable ways of calculating drop-
out rates, while we used a standard ITT method whereby all
participants who did not finish treatment after randomiza-
tion were considered dropouts regardless of whether they
started treatment or what their specific reasons were for dis-
continuing it. Moreover, in calculating rates, we reported the
absolute number of dropouts relative to the number of ran-
domized participants in each group. In contrast, individual
trials used very diverse methods for defining dropouts, such
as considering participants who switched therapists19,38,39 or
who missed 4 consecutive sessions.40 In other cases, partici-
pants who did not initiate treatment were not counted when
calculating dropout rates.39,41,42 One meta-analysis60 of treat-
ment completion in BPD reported high treatment completion
rates (approximately 75%) but with substantial between-
study heterogeneity. However, included studies were both ob-
servational and controlled trials, randomized or not. Unlike
herein, the authors did not calculate differences in treatment
completion between the experimental and control groups. In-
stead, they pooled absolute rates for the former, a procedure
that is discouraged because it can lead to extremely high lev-
els of heterogeneity.61
We further investigated the potential sources of hetero-
geneity in subgroup and meta-regression analyses. More than
half of the trials included the treatment developer as an au-
thor, but they generated similar effects as independent trials.
Yet a subtler effect potentially related to the involvement of
the treatment developer emerged: differences between the ex-
perimental treatment and control groups were no longer sig-
nificant in trials with an ad hoc control group developed as part
of the study, where the control intervention was manualized,
or where the study team was involved in treating the control
group. We can speculate that, at least in part, the differential
efficacy of psychotherapies designed for BPD in contrast to
usualtreatmentcouldbeduetothe“specialattention”granted
to the experimental group or indeed to having a manualized,
structured treatment. Nevertheless, treatment intensity (both
treatment duration and exposure) was not related to the treat-
ment outcomes considered.
Trial RoB consistently emerged as a moderator of effect
sizes in both subgroup and meta-regression analyses. Trials
with low RoB for at least 3 of the 4 domains considered gen-
erated nonsignificant effects for borderline-relevant out-
comes. Moreover, there was a linear relationship between the
number of criteria with low RoB and effect sizes: effects de-
creased by 0.16 for each additional domain that could be rated
as low RoB. There was also evidence of publication bias for
posttest results and particularly for follow-up. Its potential
adjustment reduced effect sizes to smaller, albeit significant,
values for both design types at posttest but to nonsignificant
values for both design types at follow-up.
Limitations
Our meta-analysis has several limitations. Some outcome cat-
egories or subgroups included data from a small number of
trials,renderingresultanteffectsizespotentiallyuncertain.For
5 trials, we did not obtain access to data necessary for calcu-
lating effect sizes. Furthermore, most trials had not been reg-
istered in clinical trial registries, so we could not rate RoB
because of selective outcome reporting. Our search was broad,
but we may have missed trials that addressed personality dis-
orders in general but ultimately had a sample composed of pa-
tients with BPD. Owing to the small number of trials, we
grouped therapies in broader categories, effacing subtler dif-
ferences between orientations. Frequently cited approaches,
such as schema-focused therapy, were underrepresented,
mainly because they were mostly studied in head-to-head
trials. The use of adjunct medication was neither standard-
ized nor consistently reported and could have confounded
psychotherapy effects.
Conclusions
Various independent psychotherapies demonstrated effi-
cacy for borderline-relevant symptoms, self-harm, suicide,
health service use, and general psychopathology in BPD.
However, effects were small, inflated by publication bias, and
particularly unstable for follow-up. These effects were no lon-
ger sustained in trials with low RoB. While treatment inten-
sity per se did not seem to influence outcomes, there are
indications that a control group balanced for the involve-
ment of the study team in treatment or with a manualized
protocol is as effective as psychotherapies tailored for BPD.
We found no evidence that treatment retention would be
higher for specific psychotherapies than for control inter-
ventions, contradicting systematic claims from individual
trials. Future trials should implement prospective registra-
tion in clinical trial registries.
