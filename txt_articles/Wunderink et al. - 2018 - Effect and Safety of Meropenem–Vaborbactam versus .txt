ABSTRACT
Introduction: Treatment
options
for
car-
bapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) in-
fections are limited and CRE infections remain
associated with high clinical failure and mor-
tality rates, particularly in vulnerable patient
populations. A Phase 3, multinational, open-
label, randomized controlled trial (TANGO II)
was conducted from 2014 to 2017 to evaluate
the efficacy/safety of meropenem–vaborbactam
monotherapy
versus
best
available
therapy
(BAT) for CRE.
Methods: A total of 77 patients with con-
firmed/suspected
CRE
infection
(bacteremia,
hospital-acquired/ventilator-associated
bacte-
rial pneumonia, complicated intra-abdominal
infection, complicated urinary tract infection/

with confirmed CRE infection formed the pri-
mary analysis population (microbiologic-CRE-
modified intent-to-treat, mCRE-MITT). Eligible
patients
were
randomized
2:1
to
meropenem–vaborbactam (2 g/2 g over 3 h, q8h
for
7–14 days)
or
BAT
(mono/combination
therapy
with
polymyxins,
carbapenems,
aminoglycosides, tigecycline; or ceftazidime-
avibactam alone). Efficacy endpoints included
clinical
cure,
Day-28
all-cause
mortality,
microbiologic cure, and overall success (clinical
cure ? microbiologic eradication). Safety end-
points included adverse events (AEs) and labo-
ratory findings.
Results: Within the mCRE-MITT population,
cure rates were 65.6% (21/32) and 33.3% (5/15)
[95% confidence interval (CI) of difference,
3.3% to 61.3%; P = 0.03)] at End of Treatment
and 59.4% (19/32) and 26.7% (4/15) (95% CI of
difference, 4.6% to 60.8%; P = 0.02) at Test of
Cure;.Day-28
all-cause mortality was 15.6%
(5/32) and 33.3% (5/15) (95% CI of difference,
- 44.7% to 9.3%) for meropenem–vaborbactam
versus BAT, respectively. Treatment-related AEs
and renal-related AEs were 24.0% (12/50) and
4.0% (2/50) for meropenem–vaborbactam ver-
sus 44.0% (11/25) and 24.0% (6/25) for BAT.
Exploratory risk–benefit analyses of composite
clinical
failure
or
nephrotoxicity
favored
meropenem–vaborbactam versus BAT (31.3%
[10/32] versus 80.0% [12/15]; 95% CI of differ-
ence, - 74.6% to - 22.9%; P \ 0.001).
Conclusions: Monotherapy
with
meropenem–vaborbactam
for
CRE
infection
was associated with increased clinical cure,
decreased mortality, and reduced nephrotoxic-
ity compared with BAT.

 INTRODUCTION
Increasing antimicrobial resistance, particularly
among Gram-negative pathogens, has resulted
in
a
critical
need
for
new
antibiotics
[1].
Government
agencies
and
public
health
authorities have initiated programs and policies
for the development of new antibiotics for these
pathogens, in large part due to the spread of
beta-lactam resistance [2–5]. Ten million deaths
per year by 2050 are estimated if antimicrobial
resistance is not adequately addressed [6].
Carbapenems
have
been
a
last
defense
against
extended-spectrum
beta-lactamase-re-
sistant pathogens [7]. Dissemination of car-
bapenemases
[e.g.,
Klebsiella
pneumoniae
carbapenemase (KPC)] among Enterobacteri-
aceae has reduced the activity of carbapenems
and other agents for these pathogens [8]. Con-
sequently, treatment options for carbapenem-
resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) infections
are limited [9–11] and CRE infections remain
associated with high clinical failure and mor-
tality rates, particularly in vulnerable patient
populations [12–16].
Vaborbactam is a first-in-class, boron-based,
beta-lactamase inhibitor, with activity against
serine beta-lactamases, especially optimized for
potent
KPC
inhibition.
Combination
with
meropenem restores activity against KPC-pro-
ducing CRE in vitro and preclinical models [17];
this combination has a similar pharmacokinetic
profile as meropenem alone [18].
The
Targeting
Antibiotic
Non-susceptible
Gram-negative
Organisms
(TANGO)
I
trial
established
the
safety
and
effectiveness
of
meropenem–vaborbactam compared to piper-
acillin-tazobactam in complicated urinary tract
infections (cUTI), including acute pyelonephri-
tis (AP) [19, 20]. VABOMERE was FDA-approved
in the United States in 2017. TANGO II, a Phase
3 randomized trial, was conducted to evaluate
the efficacy and safety of meropenem–vabor-
bactam
monotherapy
versus
best
available
therapy (BAT) in adults with serious infections
due to CRE.
METHODS
Study Design and Participants
TANGO II was a Phase 3, randomized, prospec-
tive,
multicenter,
multinational,
open-label,
active-controlled trial of adults with infections
due
to
confirmed/suspected
CRE.
The
trial
enrolled patients from 27 hospital sites in 8
countries (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Greece,
Israel, Italy, United Kingdom, United States)
with known prevalence of KPC-producing CRE
between November 2014 and June 2017. Pro-
tocol
and
informed
consent
form
were
approved by the sites’ Institutional Review
Boards/Independent Ethics Committees. The
trial was conducted in accordance with the
International
Conference
on
Harmonisation
Good Clinical Practice Guideline and with the
1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amend-
ments or comparable ethical standards. Prior to
initiation
of
study-related
procedures,
an
informed consent form was signed by the
patient or guardian/legal representative.
Prior to initiation of study-related proce-
dures, an informed consent form was signed by
the patient or guardian/legal representative. An
independent
Data
Safety
Monitoring
Board
(DSMB) reviewed accumulated safety data at
scheduled intervals and serious adverse events
on an ongoing basis. Once 72 patients were
included in the safety and efficacy analysis, the
DSMB determined the study met its stated
objectives and advised discontinuing the study
in its current form, as the risk/benefit analysis
did not support ongoing randomization of
patients to the BAT arm and would not be in the
best interest of patients.
Eligible patients were age C 18 years with
cUTI/AP,
hospital-acquired/ventilator-associ-
ated bacterial pneumonia (HABP/VABP), bac-
teremia,
or
complicated
intra-abdominal
infection (cIAI), and confirmed or suspected
(evidence in culture or molecular testing within
past 90 days) CRE pathogen, requiring C 7 days
of intravenous (IV) therapy (eTable 1). Patients
with confirmed CRE infection were eligible if
the baseline CRE pathogen was not susceptible
to the current antimicrobial therapy (or the
Infect Dis Ther (2018) 7:439–455
441
 patient was not on antimicrobial therapy). If
susceptible, patients were eligible if they had
received B 24 h of therapy before enrollment or
had clinical deterioration/failure to improve
after C 48 h of therapy. Patients with suspected
CRE infection who received B 24 h of empirical
Gram-negative
antimicrobial
therapy
before
enrollment were also eligible.
Key exclusion criteria included: history of sig-
nificant hypersensitivity to beta-lactam antibi-
otics; confirmed infection with CRE-producing
New Delhi metallo (NDM)-, Verona integron-en-
coded
metallo-,
imipenemase-metallo-,
or
oxacillinase-encoded beta-lactamases (based on
local microbiology laboratory results); Acute
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II [21]
score[ 30; or immediately life-threatening dis-
ease. Patients with impaired renal function,
including
hemodialysis,
were
eligible;
those
receiving continuous renal replacement therapy
were not. Immunocompromised patients—leu-
kemia or lymphoma (not in remission), prior solid
organ/stem cell transplantation, neutropenia, or
active receipt of immunosuppressive medications
(including
high-dose
systemic
steroids
for C 2 weeks)—were eligible (NCT02168946).
Bacterial Isolates
CRE isolates were defined as Enterobacteriaceae
with susceptibility results intermediate or resis-
tant to carbapenems using Clinical and Labo-
ratory Standards Institute (CLSI) 2014 criteria
[22]. Carbapenem resistance was defined as a
meropenem minimal inhibitory concentration
(MIC) [ 1 mg/L (or disk diffusion zone diame-
ter \ 23 mm). If meropenem was not used for
susceptibility testing, an isolate was considered
carbapenem-resistant if intermediate or resis-
tant to all carbapenems tested [22]. The causa-
tive pathogen had to be isolated from blood or
infection
site
(urine,
respiratory
secretions,
intra-abdominal
fluid)
cultures
col-
lected B 3 days before enrollment. Additional
adequacy criteria for baseline pathogens dif-
fered by infection type (NCT02168946 ).
Additional infection-site specimens, when
possible,
and
blood
cultures
were
obtained
immediately before the first dose of study drug. If
unavailable or negative, the screening sample was
used as the baseline sample. Isolates were sent to a
central laboratory (JMI) for confirmatory culture,
identification, and susceptibility testing using
CLSI and European Committee on Antimicrobial
Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) criteria [23].
Central laboratory results were used for all anal-
yses when available; if unavailable, local labora-
tory results were used (NCT02168946). Local
microbiology laboratory results for culture and
susceptibility testing were utilized for patient
treatment purposes.
Randomization and Blinding
Eligible
patients
were
randomized
2:1
to
meropenem–vaborbactam or BAT using a com-
puter-generated
central
randomization
code
and
interactive
voice/web
response
system.
Randomization was stratified by infection type
(cUTI/AP, HABP, VABP, cIAI, bacteremia) and
region (North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, rest
of world). Principal investigators and staff were
not blinded to treatment assignment. A blinded
local investigator also assessed clinical out-
comes, and a blinded adjudication committee
ensured
unbiased
assessments.
The
blinded
adjudication committee decision was used for
disagreement between the local blinded and
unblinded investigator’s evaluations.
Interventions
Patients randomized to meropenem–vaborbac-
tam
received
7–14 days
of
treatment
as
monotherapy (2–2 g) via IV infusion over 3 h
every 8 h. BAT included any of the following as
monotherapy or in combination: polymyxins,
carbapenems, aminoglycosides, or tigecycline; or
monotherapy with ceftazidime-avibactam. Use of
an aminoglycoside beyond 72 h in subjects with a
pathogen(s) susceptible to meropenem–vabor-
bactam or ceftazidime-avibactam was considered
a treatment failure. BAT was selected by the pri-
mary service and confirmed by the unblinded
investigator according to institutional standards
of care, patient characteristics (i.e., renal func-
tion, previous treatments, infection type, organ-
ism with corresponding MICs, etc.), and local
regulatory approval. The choice of BAT regimen
442
Infect Dis Ther (2018) 7:439–455
 was left up to the investigator. Planned BAT was
documented prior to randomization.
For patients with moderate-to-severe renal
impairment (estimated creatinine clearance \
50 mL/min),
meropenem–vaborbactam
dose
modifications were made (NCT02168946). BAT
doses were adjusted according to local protocols.
Outcomes and Assessments
Efficacy endpoints across all infection types
included: proportion of patients with clinical
cure at the End of Treatment (EOT) and Test of
Cure (TOC) (7 ± 2 days after EOT); proportion
of patients with microbiologic cure at EOT and
TOC; and Day-28 all-cause mortality in the
microbiologic-CRE-modified
intent-to-treat
(mCRE-MITT) population.
Primary efficacy endpoints for each infection
type were based on FDA guidelines in the
mCRE-MITT population and included: the pro-
portion of patients that achieved overall success
(composite endpoint of clinical cure ? micro-
biologic eradication) at TOC in the cUTI/AP
subgroup; all-cause mortality in the combined
HABP/VABP and bacteremia subgroups; and the
proportion of patients with clinical cure at TOC
in the cIAI subgroup. Overall success at EOT was
also assessed in the cUTI/AP subgroup. Second-
ary endpoints are listed in NCT02168946.
Clinical cure was defined as complete resolu-
tion of signs/symptoms of the index infection
such that no further antimicrobial therapy (and/
or surgical intervention for cIAI) was warranted.
Microbiologic cure was defined as microbiologic
eradication or presumed eradication (clinical
cure in absence of sample for repeat culture) at
EOT and TOC (NCT02168946).
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs)
and laboratory parameters were collected. AEs
were coded using the Medical Dictionary for
Regulatory Activities (v.17.0) and graded for
severity
according
to
the
National
Cancer
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events [24]. Renal function was cate-
gorized according to changes in serum crea-
tinine using Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, or End-
Stage (RIFLE) criteria and change from baseline
serum creatinine [25]. Clinical status (vital
signs, physical exam) was assessed at baseline,
Day 3, Day 7, EOT, TOC, and Late Follow-up,
and as clinically indicated.
Statistical Analysis
Analysis Populations
Safety and MITT were the same and defined as
all patients who received C 1 dose of study
drug.
Microbiologic
modified
intent-to-treat
(m-MITT)
populations
included
those
who
received C 1 dose of study drug and had a
baseline qualifying Gram-negative pathogen.
The primary study population was the mCRE-
MITT
population,
defined
as
patients
who
received C 1 dose of study drug and had a
baseline qualifying isolate confirmed as CRE by
local or central laboratory (NCT02168946).
Descriptive and Inferential Analysis Methods
This was a descriptive study of patients infected
with CRE pathogens; no formal power or sample
size calculations were performed. However, in
light of the magnitude and consistency of dif-
ferences in clinical outcomes and all-cause mor-
tality across patients in the primary population,
ad hoc inferential testing was performed for
selected outcomes. Differences in clinical cure at
EOT and TOC and Day-28 all-cause mortality
across all infection types were analyzed using the
Wald test of equality. For exploratory analyses of
composite
endpoints
of
clinical
failure
or
nephrotoxicity (2 definitions: either post-base-
line increase in serum creatinine C 1.0 mg/dL; or
AE preferred term of renal failure, renal failure
acute, or renal impairment) and Day-28 all-cause
mortality or nephrotoxicity (same definitions),
Wald test of equality was used. For all study
endpoints and analyses, descriptive summaries
of proportion of patients in each group, and dif-
ference in proportions are provided (Table 1).

 (Fig. 1). Among these, 75 (50 meropenem–

study drug, comprising the MITT and safety
population.
Of
the
75
patients,
54
(35
meropenem–vaborbactam;
19
BAT)
had
a
qualifying
baseline Gram-negative
pathogen
(m-MITT population). Among these, 47 (32
meropenem–vaborbactam; 15 BAT) had micro-
biologically confirmed CRE infection (mCRE-
MITT population).
In the MITT population, the most common
infection types were bacteremia (36.0%, 27/75)
and cUTI/AP (45.3%, 34/75). Another 9.3%
(7/75) were HABP/VABP and 9.3% (7/75) were
cIAI (eTable 2). A greater proportion of patients
with prior antibiotic failure were randomized to
meropenem–vaborbactam
(10/50)
than
BAT
(0/25). Baseline characteristics inferred a vul-
nerable patient population: 28.0% (21/75) had
renal impairment, 73.3% (55/75) had a Charl-
son Comorbidity Index C 5, 42.7% (32/75) had
systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and
32.0% (24/75) met study pre-defined criteria for
immune compromise. Klebsiella pneumoniae was
the most common pathogen [58.7% (44/75)]
(eTable 2). Baseline demographic and clinical
characteristics in the mCRE-MITT population
were
like
those
of
the
MITT
population
(Table 2).
In the mCRE-MITT population, K. pneumoniae
was again the most common pathogen (87.2%
[41/47]) and meropenem MICs for K. pneumoniae
were similar across treatment groups (MIC50
32 lg/mL, MICrange B 0.03 to [ 64 lg/mL in the
meropenem–vaborbactam
group
and
MIC50
[
32 lg/mL, MICrange [ 8 to [ 64 lg/mL in the
BAT group) (eTable 3).The meropenem MIC50for
KPC-producing K. pneumoniae was 64 lg/mL in
both groups. Five K. pneumoniae isolates showed
a
meropenem–vaborbactam
MIC [ 4 lg/mL
(3 patients randomized to meropenem–vabor-
bactam; 2 to BAT): 4 produced metallo-beta-lac-
tamases or class D carbapenemases (NDM or
OXA-48) and 1 produced KPC-3 (randomized to
BAT). Among organisms cultured after random-
ization, 1/32 (3.1%) in the meropenem–vabor-
bactam group developed a C 4-fold increase in
MIC

 treatment (from 0.25 to 1 lg/mL). A range of BAT
treatments were given (eTables 4 and 5); 60.0% of
patients received at least one antimicrobial agent
to which the baseline CRE pathogen was sus-
ceptible by CLSI breakpoints. In the BAT group,
1/15 (6.7%) developed a C 4-fold increase in
MIC to a BAT regimen (polymyxin ? aminogly-
coside, eTables
4 and 5): polymyxin, from
1
to [ 4 lg/mL;
and
gentamicin,
from
1 to [ 16 lg/mL. The mean (standard deviation)
duration of treatment exposure was 9.3 (3.9) days
for meropenem–vaborbactam and 9.1 (4.0) days
for BAT.
Efficacy
In the mCRE-MITT population, meropenem–
vaborbactam was associated with higher rates of
clinical cure than BAT at both EOT [65.6% (21/
32) vs. 33.3% (5/15); difference, 32.3%; 95% CI
3.3–61.3%, P = 0.03] and TOC [59.4% (19/32)
vs. 26.7% (4/15); difference, 32.7%; 95% CI
4.6–60.8%; P = 0.02] (Table 2). Primary reasons
for clinical failure in both groups were death
and discontinuation of study drug (due to either
death,
clinical
failure/need
for
additional
antimicrobials, or AEs). Only 1 patient in the
meropenem–vaborbactam group within mCRE-
MITT required adjudication of clinical outcome
by the blinded committee, representing high
concordance between blinded and unblinded
assessments. No patients in the BAT mCRE-
MITT group required adjudication due to dis-
cordance.
Day-28
all-cause
mortality
was
numerically lower with meropenem–vaborbac-
tam versus BAT [15.6% (5/32) vs. 33.3% (5/15);
difference, - 17.7%; 95% CI - 44.7 to 9.3%;
P = 0.20].
While
1
in
5
deaths
in
the
meropenem–vaborbactam group was associated
with an AE term of sepsis, 4 of the 5 deaths in
the BAT group were associated with AE terms of
sepsis/septic shock (eTable 6). A trend towards
significantly greater microbiologic
cure
was
found at EOT in the meropenem–vaborbactam
group compared to the BAT group [65.6% (21/
32) vs. 40.0% (6/15); difference, 25.6%; 95% CI
- 4.1 to 55.4%; P = 0.09]; at TOC, this differ-
ence was 19.8% (53.1% [17/32] vs. 33.3% [5/15];
95%CI, - 9.7 to 49.3%; P = 0.19) (Table 2).
Within
infection
type
categories
in
the
mCRE-MITT population, Day-28 all-cause mor-
tality rates were numerically lower in patients
with HABP/VABP or bacteremia who received
meropenem–vaborbactam than in those who
received BAT [22.2% (4/18) vs. 44.4% (4/9),
difference, - 22.2%; 95% CI - 59.9 to 15.5%;
P = 0.25)] (eTable 7). In patients with cUTI/AP,
overall success rates at EOT were numerically
higher
among
patients
who
received
meropenem–vaborbactam
than
those
who
received BAT [75.0% (9/12) vs. 50.0% (2/4)];
overall success rates at TOC were 33.3% (4/12)
for meropenem–vaborbactam and 50.0% (2/4)
for BAT. Among the few patients with cIAI, the
clinical cure rate at TOC was 100% (2/2) in the
meropenem–vaborbactam group and 0% (0/2)
in the BAT group. Efficacy endpoints in patients
with all infection types in the MITT and
m-MITT populations are shown in eTables 8 and
9, respectively.
In view of the imbalance in the proportion of
randomized patients with prior antimicrobial
failure, a sensitivity analysis was performed. Six
of
8
clinical
failures
and
4
of
5
on
meropenem–vaborbactam (mCRE-MITT) occur-
red in patients with prior antibiotic failure. In a
sensitivity analysis across infection types, an
increase
in
the
treatment
effect
of
meropenem–vaborbactam over BAT for both

(4/15);
95%
CI
of
difference,
13.7–72.1%;
P = 0.004] and all-cause mortality [4.3% (1/23)
vs. .33.3% (5/15); 95% CI of difference, - 54.3
to - 3.7%; P = 0.02] was seen in patients
without prior antibiotic failure (Table 2). Addi-
tional subgroup analyses showed consistent
improvement in clinical cure and decreased
mortality associated with meropenem–vabor-
bactam (Fig. 2). Among immunocompromised
patients specifically, meropenem–vaborbactam
showed substantially higher cure rates than BAT
at TOC [63.6% (7/11) vs. 0.0% (0/8); 95% CI of
difference, 35.2–92.1%; P \ 0.001].

were seen with meropenem–vaborbactam than

In light of the combined improvement in
efficacy
outcomes
and
reduced
renal
AEs,
exploratory analyses were performed to quantify
the risk–benefit profile of meropenem–vabor-
bactam versus BAT. The composite endpoint of
Day-28 all-cause mortality or nephrotoxicity
(defined as either C 1.0 mg/dL increase in post-
baseline creatinine or renal AEs) demonstrated
improvement in the risk–benefit profile with
meropenem–vaborbactam
compared
to
BAT
(25.0% vs. 40.0%; 95% CI of difference, - 44.0%
to 14.0%; P = 0.31 and 18.8% vs. 60.0%; 95% CI
- 69.5 to - 13.0%; P = 0.004, by each nephro-
toxicity
definition,
respectively).
Composite
endpoints of clinical failure or nephrotoxicity
and clinical failure or renal AEs were also associ-
ated with a superior risk–benefit profile for
meropenem–vaborbactam
compared
to
BAT
(31.3% vs. 80.0%; 95% CI - 74.6 to - 22.9%,
P \ 0.001 and 28.1% vs. 80.0%; 95% CI - 77.4 to
- 26.3%, P \ 0.001) (Table 2).
DISCUSSION
TANGO II is the first prospective, Phase 3
comparative trial of monotherapy with a novel
agent in patients with CRE infections. While
development of antimicrobials targeting Gram-
negative pathogens has increased in recent
years, few have been evaluated prospectively in
patients with CRE infections. The TANGO II
population
represented
patients
with
CRE
infections [26, 27], including patients with
multiple comorbidities, underlying immuno-
compromise,
and
moderate-to-severe
renal
impairment. Importantly, meropenem–vabor-
bactam was given as monotherapy. In contrast,
the
comparator,
‘‘best-available
therapy’’,
reflected usual care for CRE–an individualized
cocktail of antibiotics from different classes
(e.g., tetracyclines, carbapenems, polymyxins,
and aminoglycosides), which often individually
have poor activity against CRE and increased
toxicities, particularly nephrotoxicity. Consis-
tent with prior retrospective series, BAT in this
trial
included
combination
regimens,
often
with a high-dose carbapenem [12, 26, 27].
The most frequent primary pathogen in this
study, KPC-producing K. pneumoniae (in the
mCRE-MITT population), 72.7% of K. pneumo-
niae were KPC-producing, reflects CRE epi-
demiology
in
the
United
States
and
most
regions of the world [28, 29]. KPC-producing K.
pneumoniae MIC values for meropenem in this
trial (64 lg/mL) demonstrate the high degree of
resistance among CRE isolates studied.
The trial showed reduced all-cause mortality,
accompanied
by
a
statistically
significant
increase
in
cure
rates,
associated
with
meropenem–vaborbactam. This increased cure
rate was demonstrated even in immunocom-
promised patients, a group typically excluded
from clinical trials, yet at high risk for CRE
infections. Meropenem–vaborbactam was also
associated with decreased mortality in patients
with HABP/VABP or bacteremia, the most seri-
ous CRE infections. Inclusion of these high-risk
populations likely contributed to the ability to
detect
clinically
meaningful
differences
between meropenem–vaborbactam and BAT.
Nephrotoxicity management is challenging
in patients with serious Gram-negative infec-
tions, particularly in vulnerable populations
(critically ill, immunocompromised) [16, 30].
Patients randomized to meropenem–vaborbac-
tam
experienced
fewer
AEs
and
decreased
nephrotoxicity versus BAT. Together, higher
cure rates and lower mortality and nephrotoxi-
city rates with meropenem–vaborbactam versus
BAT prompted the DSMB to recommend ending
randomization to BAT following their review
during an interim analysis.
Limitations of TANGO II include small sam-
ple size, despite being the largest trial to date
specifically for CRE. The study was open-label to
enable investigator selection and maintenance
of BAT. This limitation was mitigated by inves-
tigator requirement to define BAT prior to ran-
domization and incorporation of both a blinded
local site evaluation and a separate blinded
adjudication committee to assess outcomes. The
Infect Dis Ther (2018) 7:439–455
451
 low number of cases requiring adjudication and
directional consistency of improved cure rates
along with reduced mortality suggests that this
limitation
should
not
confound
trial
conclusions.
CONCLUSION
In summary, treatment of serious CRE infec-
tions
with
meropenem–vaborbactam
monotherapy was associated with clinically
significant improvement in clinical cure rates,
lower nephrotoxicity rates, and marked trend
towards
lower
mortality
than
BAT.
Meropenem–vaborbactam is a valuable new
addition to the antimicrobial armamentarium
against CRE pathogens.
