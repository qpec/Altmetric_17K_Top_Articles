ABSTRACT
Background: Nationally representative estimates of
diabetes mellitus (DM) prevalence among HIV-infected
adults in the USA are lacking, and whether HIV-
infected adults are at increased risk of DM compared
with the general adult population remains controversial.
Methods: We used nationally representative survey
(2009–2010) data from the Medical Monitoring Project
(n=8610 HIV-infected adults) and the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (n=5604 general
population adults) and fit logistic regression models to
determine and compare weighted prevalences of DM
between the two populations, and examine factors
associated with DM among HIV-infected adults.
Results: DM prevalence among HIV-infected adults
was 10.3% (95% CI 9.2% to 11.5%). DM prevalence
was 3.8% (CI 1.8% to 5.8%) higher in HIV-infected
adults compared with general population adults.
HIV-infected subgroups, including women (prevalence
difference 5.0%, CI 2.3% to 7.7%), individuals aged
20–44 (4.1%, CI 2.7% to 5.5%), and non-obese
individuals (3.5%, CI 1.4% to 5.6%), had increased
DM prevalence compared with general population
adults. Factors associated with DM among HIV-infected
adults included age, duration of HIV infection,
geometric mean CD4 cell count, and obesity.
Conclusions: 1 in 10 HIV-infected adults receiving
medical care had DM. Although obesity contributes to
DM risk among HIV-infected adults, comparisons to
the general adult population suggest that DM among
HIV-infected persons may develop at earlier ages and
in the absence of obesity.
INTRODUCTION
Diabetes
mellitus
(DM)
is
an
important
cause of morbidity and mortality in the USA.
In 2014, there were an estimated 29.1 million
persons with DM, of whom 27.8% were
undiagnosed.1 Uncontrolled DM can result
in significant disability due to complications
such
as
blindness
and
end-stage
renal
disease, and is associated with premature
mortality
due
to
cancer
and
vascular
disease.2
3 Furthermore, the medical and
societal costs of DM are substantial. In 2012,
in the USA alone, DM accounted for $176
billion US in direct medical costs and $69
billion US in reduced productivity.4
In the USA, advances in treatment of HIV
infection have led to decreased mortality and
increased life expectancy among HIV-infected
persons.5 6 Consequently, chronic metabolic
and cardiovascular diseases such as DM are
gaining importance as causes of morbidity and
mortality among HIV-infected persons.7 While
the burden of DM among the general US
adult population has been well described,
nationally
representative
estimates
of
DM
prevalence among HIV-infected adults are
lacking. In addition, whether HIV-infected
adults are at increased risk of developing DM
compared with the general adult population
remains controversial.8–11
We analyzed nationally representative data
from the Medical Monitoring Project (MMP)
with the following objectives: (1) estimate
DM prevalence among a nationally represen-
tative sample of HIV-infected adults; (2)
compare
the
prevalence
of
DM
in
HIV-infected adults versus the general US
adult population; and (3) identify factors
associated
with
prevalent
DM
among
HIV-infected adults.
Key messages
▪ Among a nationally representative US sample of
HIV-infected adults receiving medical care, the
prevalence of diagnosed diabetes mellitus (DM)
was 10.3%.
▪ HIV-infected adults may be likely to have DM at
younger ages and in the absence of obesity
compared with the general US adult population.
▪ The prevalence of DM among HIV-infected adults
is high and HIV-care providers should follow
existing screening guidelines, which recommend
FBG and HbA1c be obtained prior to and after
starting antiretroviral therapy.

 METHODS
Data sources and study design
We used 2009–2010 data from MMP and the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to
estimate DM prevalence among HIV-infected adults and
the general US adult population, respectively. Our ana-
lyses were restricted to adults aged ≥20 years, and
excluded pregnant women.
MMP is a surveillance system that produces nationally
representative
estimates
of
behavioral
and
clinical
characteristics of HIV-infected adults who receive HIV
medical care in the USA. MMP is a cross-sectional survey
with a multistage probability design. Detailed descriptions
of the sampling methodology and data collection proce-
dures have been published elsewhere.12 Briefly, sampling
was conducted in three consecutive stages: (1) USA and
dependent areas, (2) outpatient HIV care facilities, and (3)
HIV-infected adults aged ≥18 years who made at least one
medical care visit to a sampled facility between January and
April of 2009 and 2010. Data were collected during June
2009 through May 2011. Facility response rates were 76%
(461/603)
in
2009
and
81%
(474/582)
in
2010.
Approximately 50% of persons sampled from these facil-
ities completed an interview and had their medical records
abstracted. After excluding 81 individuals who were either
<20 years of age or pregnant, our MMP sample included
8610 participants, representing an estimated average of
427 928 HIV-infected adults. The Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) National Center for HIV,
Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention has determined
MMP to be a non-research public health surveillance activ-
ity, and thus, it was not reviewed by a federal institutional
review board (IRB). Participating states or territories and
facilities obtained local IRB approval to conduct MMP if
required locally. Informed consent was obtained from all
interviewed participants.
NHANES is a cross-sectional health examination survey
with a stratified multistage probability design representa-
tive of the general non-institutionalized US population.
Descriptions of the sampling plan, and examination and
interview protocol are published elsewhere.13 In the 2009–
2010 cycle of NHANES, the unweighted response rate for
the interviewed and examined persons was 77.3%, result-
ing in a final sample of 10 253 persons. After excluding
individuals <20 years and pregnant women, 5604 (54.6%)
adults remained in the sample, representing an estimated
2.1 million non-institutionalized adults living in the USA
in 2009–2010. NHANES was approved by CDC’s National
Center for Health Statistics Institutional Research Ethics
Review Board.
Survey sample weights in NHANES and MMP account
for
the
differential
probabilities
of
selection,
non-
response to survey instruments, and differences between
the final sample and the total population.
Measures
The primary outcome variable was DM. In MMP
, DM
was defined using the following criteria documented in
the medical record: (1) physician-diagnosed DM listed
on a problem list or in the assessment/plan portion of a
progress note; or (2) prescription of insulin or oral
hypoglycemic medications (excluding metformin mono-
therapy). In NHANES, DM was defined using the follow-
ing criteria: (1) answered ‘Yes’ to the question: ‘Other
than during pregnancy, have you ever been told by a
doctor or health professional that you have diabetes or
sugar diabetes?’; or (2) answered ‘Yes’ to any of the fol-
lowing questions: (a) ‘Are you now taking insulin?’; or
(b) ‘Are you now taking diabetic pills to lower your
blood sugar? These are sometimes called oral agents
and oral hypoglycemic agents’. Prescription medication
data available in NHANES were used to exclude indivi-
duals treated with metformin monotherapy who had
responded ‘Yes’ to question 2b. Exclusion of patients on
metformin monotherapy who were not classified as
having DM in MMP or answered ‘No’ to question 1 in
NHANES were excluded due to the use of this medica-
tion for pre-diabetes and polycystic ovarian syndrome.
Laboratory criteria to establish the diagnosis of DM were
available for MMP and NHANES; however, they were not
used because the fasting nature of blood glucose mea-
surements from laboratory data abstracted from medical
charts was unknown, and HbA1c measurements have
not been validated for the diagnosis of DM among
HIV-infected individuals.10
14
15 Our analyses of DM
prevalence were therefore restricted to comparisons of
diagnosed DM, as described above.
Sociodemographic variables collected for MMP and
NHANES included age, sex at birth, race/ethnicity, edu-
cation, and poverty level. The number and percentage
of participants meeting current poverty guidelines for
MMP and NHANES were determined using the US
Department of Health and Human Services poverty
guidelines. In MMP
, body mass index (BMI) measure-
ments were abstracted from medical records for the year
prior to the interview. If height was missing (n=1534
(17.7%) in MMP), BMI category was inferred from
recorded weight using previously published methods.16
In NHANES, BMI was measured using standardized
techniques and equipment. BMI ≥30 kg/m2 was consid-
ered
indicative
of
obesity.
Clinical
MMP
variables
included time since HIV diagnosis, geometric mean
CD4+ T-lymphocyte (CD4) count, documented prescrip-
tion of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and disease stage
per CDC criteria.17
CD4 were described using geometric means, calcu-
lated by back transforming the logarithm of CD4; geo-
metric means instead of arithmetic means were used
because of the skewed distribution of CD4. MMP partici-
pants were classified as being infected with hepatitis
C virus (HCV) if any of the following were documented
in their medical record: (1) a positive anti-HCV enzyme
immunoassay (EIA) or strip immunoblot assay (RIBA);
(2) an HCV genotype or (3) HCV-RNA identified
through
reverse
transcriptase–PCR
(RT–PCR).18

cipants received a screening HCV antibody test by EIA
with confirmation of positive test results using RIBA.
Samples with an indeterminate RIBA were tested for
HCV-RNA to confirm HCV infection status.
Data analyses
Prevalence of and factors associated with DM among
HIV-infected adults
Among HIV-infected adults, we calculated the weighted
prevalence and 95% CIs of DM overall and by each of
the following characteristics: age (20–44, 45–60, and
≥60 years), sex at birth, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic
White and Black, Hispanic, and Other), education (less
than high school, high school or equivalent, and more
than high school), poverty level (living at or below the
poverty line and living above the poverty line, obesity,
time since HIV diagnosis (<5, 5–9, and ≥10 years), geo-
metric mean CD4 count (0–199, 200–349, 350–499, and
≥500 cells/mm3), use of ART during the surveillance
period, CDC HIV disease stage (AIDS or nadir CD4
0–199, no AIDS and nadir CD4 200–500, and no AIDS
and
nadir
CD4>500),
and
HCV
coinfection.
All
characteristics were analyzed as categorical variables.
To identify factors associated with DM in HIV-infected
persons, we used multivariable logistic regression models
with DM as the dependent variable, and all previously
mentioned characteristics as independent variables. We
computed model-adjusted prevalences for all levels of
each of the selected characteristics with predicted mar-
ginal means, and estimated crude and adjusted preva-
lence
ratios
(PR)
for
each
characteristic.19
20
We
calculated CIs for adjusted-prevalence estimates and PRs.
Comparisons between HIV-infected adults receiving medical
care and general US population adults
Weighted percentages and CIs were determined for DM
among HIV-infected adults and the general US adult
population stratified by age group, sex at birth, race/eth-
nicity,
education,
poverty
level,
obesity,
and
HCV
infection.
We used marginal standardization methods with pre-
dicted marginal probabilities to compare the prevalence
of DM between MMP and NHANES. In marginal stand-
ardization, the predicted probability of the outcome of
interest is adjusted to a weighted average reflecting the
distribution of covariates in the target population; the
marginal effect obtained is the proportion of subjects
with the outcome that would have been observed were
the study population forced to the exposure level (ie,
HIV infection). In other words, given the demographic
and clinical characteristics of the populations in MMP
and NHANES, what would the predicted probability of
DM
be
were
they
to
be
infected
with
HIV and
vice-versa.20
Under the assumption that MMP and NHANES were
two independent samples, with independent design vari-
ables and weights, we combined the two data sets and
constructed a multivariable logistic model using pre-
dicted marginal probabilities with DM as the outcome
variable and the following independent variables: an indi-
cator variable for survey type (1=MMP; 0=NHANES), all
characteristics
listed
above,
and
interaction
terms
between the indicator variable and all characteristics.21 22
Using the predicted marginal prevalence of DM, we
computed prevalence differences (PD) comparing the
two populations, adjusting for all characteristics in MMP
and NHANES included in the model.19 Linear contrasts
were used to test for heterogeneity among subgroups
between the adjusted estimates of diagnosed DM in the
HIV-infected and general US adult populations. To
assess whether differences in care-seeking could account
for differences in DM prevalence between the two popu-
lations, we performed a second analysis restricting our
comparison of HIV-infected adults receiving medical
care to the general US adult population who had
received medical care in the previous year.
All analyses were performed using SAS 9.3 (SAS
Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA) and SAS-callable
SUDAAN 10.0.1 (RTI International, Research Triangle
Park, North Carolina, USA) and accounted for cluster-
ing, unequal selection probabilities, and non-response.
RESULTS
MMP participants had the following characteristics: male
(73.6%), non-Hispanic black (41.3%), aged 45 or more
years (59.9%), with greater than a high school education
(52.2%), and living above the federal poverty level
(56.5%) (table 1). A quarter of MMP participants had a
BMI ≥30 kg/m2, 20.6% were HCV-positive, 90.0% had
been prescribed ART in the previous year, and 73.0%
had their most recent HIV viral load reported <200
copies/mL. NHANES participants had the following
characteristics:
male
(49.3%),
non-Hispanic
black
(11.7%), aged 45 or more years (51.4%), with greater
than a high school education (58.7%), and living above
the federal poverty level (91.5%). More than a third
(36.0%) of the general US adult population had a BMI
≥30 kg/m2, and 1.7% had HCV infection.
The
unadjusted
prevalence
of
DM
(CI)
among
HIV-infected adults was 10.3% (9.1% to 11.5%), and was
higher compared with the general US adult population
(8.3% (7.2% to 9.4%)) as well as the general US adult
population
having
received
care
in
the
previous
12 months (9.7% (8.4% to 11.1%)) (data not shown).
Among HIV-infected adults with diagnosed DM, 3.9%
(95% CI 2.9% to 5.2%) had DM type 1, 52.3% (CI
46.7% to 57.8%) had DM type 2, and 43.9% (CI 38.1%
to 49.8%) had unspecified DM. After adjusting for dif-
ferences in distributions of sex, age, race/ethnicity, edu-
cation, poverty, obesity, and HCV infection prevalence,
the adjusted PD (aPD) of DM in HIV-infected adults
versus the
general
US
adult
population
was
3.8%
(table 2). The largest difference in DM prevalence
among HIV-infected adults relative to their counterparts

 Among HIV-infected adults, DM prevalence varied by
selected characteristics (table 4). The adjusted DM
prevalence was lowest among those aged 20–44 years
(6.7%)
and
highest
among
those
aged
≥60 years
(19.6%), and obese (18.9%) (table 4). Factors inde-
pendently associated with total DM among HIV-infected
adults included increasing age, obesity, increasing time
since HIV diagnosis, and geometric mean CD4.
DISCUSSION
Among
a
nationally
representative
US
sample
of
HIV-infected adults receiving medical care in 2009 and
2010, the DM prevalence was 10.3%; increasing age,
obesity, longer duration of HIV infection, and geometric
mean CD4 were independently associated with a higher
DM prevalence. When compared with the general US
adult population, HIV-infected individuals had a 3.8%
higher prevalence of DM after adjusting for age, sex,
race/ethnicity,
education,
poverty-level,
obesity,
and
HCV infection. This analysis provides the first nationally
representative
estimate
of
DM
burden
among
HIV-infected
adults
and
suggests
that
HIV-infected
persons may be more likely to have DM at younger ages
and in the absence of obesity compared with the
general US adult population.
Our estimates of DM prevalence among HIV-infected
adults are lower compared with previous US studies. The
Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study reported 14% DM
prevalence among 411 men who have sex with men
recruited from 1999 to 2003.8 The Veterans Aging
Cohort Study Virtual Cohort observed a similar baseline
prevalence (14%) in a cohort of 27 350 HIV-infected vet-
erans recruited from 2003 to 2009.23 These differences
may reflect the burden of undiagnosed diabetes mea-
sured with fasting blood glucose and HbA1c. The HIV
Outpatient Study (HOPS) reported a higher DM preva-
lence among HIV-infected women (19%) compared
with HIV-infected men (12%), a finding that although
not statistically significant was observed in our sample.24
Conversely, DM prevalence among HIV-infected indivi-
duals in non-US cohorts is significantly lower than our
estimate, ranging from 2.7% to 3.3%.9 25 26
Similar to previous studies, we observed a strong asso-
ciation between both increasing age and obesity and
prevalent DM among HIV-infected individuals,8 10 11 24 26 27
suggesting that these traditional risk factors play a major
role in the development of DM among HIV-infected
adults. Despite evidence suggesting a link between ART
and DM, ART prescription in the past year was not asso-
ciated with prevalent DM in our study.9 24 26 This may
be due to our inability to assess cumulative exposure to
ART in MMP
. The ARTs indinavir, zidovudine, saquina-
vir, stavudine, and didanosine have been associated with
a higher prevalence of DM;9 24 25 only a small percent-
age of HIV-infected adults in MMP were currently pre-
scribed these agents (0.4% indinavir, 11.2% zidovudine,
1.0% saquinavir, 1.2% stavudine, and 2.4% didanosine),
which may also account for the null association between
ART exposure and DM. Time since HIV diagnosis was
significantly associated with a higher DM prevalence.
Although the exact mechanistic pathways measured by
this variable are hard to elucidate, it may serve as a
proxy for older age, exposure to chronic inflammation
due to HIV infection, as well as cumulative exposure to
ART, all of which have been linked to insulin resist-
ance.24
26–30 Another surrogate marker for systemic
inflammation, CD4 count nadir, was not associated with
increased prevalence of DM after adjusting for other
covariates. This is contrary to previous studies which
have linked CD4+ nadir <200 cells/μL with increased
levels of interleukin 6, high-sensitivity C reactive protein,
and soluble tumor necrosis receptors.26 31 32 In addition,
geometric mean CD4 count was associated with a higher
prevalence of DM in our sample; however, the lack of
clear directionality makes it hard to interpret. Taken
together, our results highlight the need for more
nuanced measures of chronic inflammation present in
HIV infection and their interaction with traditional risk
factors such as obesity.
The aPD of DM between HIV-infected adults and the
general US adult population was heterogeneous by sub-
population. HIV-infected women had a 5% higher
prevalence than their counterparts in the general popu-
lation, an effect that was independent of obesity. There
is evidence that the use of ART may increase conversion
to DM among women with high-risk genetic polymorph-
isms;33 however, sex-specific differences in insulin resist-
ance, particularly the role of sex hormones in the
setting of HIV infection, remain understudied. Beyond
the effect of ART on insulin resistance and development
of DM, chronic inflammation during HIV infection may
accelerate the development of comorbid conditions
such as DM.32 Although this chronic inflammatory state
may
explain
the
development
of
DM
among
HIV-infected adults at younger ages and among the non-
obese, there is a continued need for research assessing
other important risk factors for DM among HIV-infected
individuals, including diet and exercise, as well as a
deeper understanding of insulin and glucose homeosta-
sis in the setting of HIV infection.
Finally, although HCV has been described as a risk
factor for DM in the general population, our findings
indicate that HIV may compound the deleterious effects
of HCV, putting HIV/HCV coinfected individuals at
even higher risk of DM.34 Observed differences could be
due
to
a
lower
engagement
in
medical
care
by
HCV-infected adults in the general population and sub-
optimal screening practices.35 Nevertheless, this finding
is particularly relevant, given the availability of directly
acting antiviral agents as curative HCV therapy and high-
lights a potential additional benefit of HCV treatment
for coinfected patients.36
Based on our findings, as well as current literature
regarding DM among HIV-infected individuals, there
are
several
important
implications.

 providers should follow existing DM screening guide-
lines, which recommend FBG and HbA1c be obtained
prior to and after starting ART.37 Second, existing data
from prospective studies should be examined to deter-
mine if screening guidelines should be modified, given
the increased prevalence of DM among younger and
non-obese HIV-infected persons. Third, improved tests
for DM diagnosis and monitoring among HIV-infected
persons should be explored, given studies that have
demonstrated the diagnostic limitations of HbA1c in this
population.10 14 15 Finally, additional research will be
important to identify optimal DM management strat-
egies among HIV-infected persons as traditional strat-
egies to improve insulin sensitivity such as weight loss
and diabetic medical therapy have been shown to be less
effective among HIV-infected individuals.38 39
This analysis is subject to several limitations. First, the
definition of diagnosed DM was different between MMP
(medical
record
abstraction)
and
NHANES
(self-
reported) and may be a source of bias. A recent cohort-
based validation of prevalence of DM based on self-report
showed a specificity and negative predictive value >95%,
with a sensitivity and positive predictive value between
60% and 70%.40 This indicates that were there a bias
introduced by self-reporting of DM, it would be towards
and
increased
prevalence
of
DM
with
self-report.
Furthermore, comparisons between self-reported and
medical record-based estimates of DM have shown
substantial agreement between both measures, and in
some cases, an underestimation of DM prevalence in
medical records relative to self-report.41–43 Second, there
is a risk of observer bias in our sample, given differences
in
engagement
in
care
between
our
samples.
We
addressed this by performing a sensitivity analysis restrict-
ing the NHANES sample to adults having received care
in the previous 12 months. Although we observed only
slight changes in the magnitude of the associations, there
is a possibility of overestimation of the PD between MMP
and NHANES. Third, risk factors for DM, such as family
history/genetics, diet, and exercise, were not included in
this analysis and could explain some of the excess preva-
lence observed among HIV-infected adults. However, the
inclusion of patients with type 1 diabetes is unlikely to
have resulted in the excess diabetes prevalence observed
in our study as the prevalence of type 1 diabetes in
NHANES has been estimated to range between 3.6% and
4.8%.44 Fourth, the measurement of BMI and HCV were
standardized for the NHANES population and not for
MMP participants resulting in a biased association
between
these
variables
and
DM
when
comparing
NHANES and MMP participants. Fifth, MMP data are
representative of HIV-infected persons receiving medical
care and do not necessarily reflect DM prevalence
among HIV-infected persons not diagnosed or not receiv-
ing care. Sixth, the increased prevalence of DM among
HIV-infected women relative to the general US adult
population may be due to misclassification bias; although
we excluded pregnant women and diagnoses labeled
gestational diabetes in the medical record of MMP parti-
cipants, female patients with gestational diabetes may
have been mislabeled and included in our sample.
Finally, the NHANES population included HIV-infected
adults who may or may not have received medical care.
However, the prevalence of HIV-infected individuals in
the
NHANES
population
is
negligible
(0.21%).45
Although diabetes rates were standardized to the com-
bined population of MMP and NHANES, given the very
small percentage represented by MMP in the general US
adult population, the bias introduced should be minimal.
CONCLUSION
We presented the first nationally representative estimate
of DM prevalence among HIV-infected adults receiving
medical care in the USA in 2009–2010 where 1 in 10
HIV-infected adults had a diagnosis of DM. Although
obesity
is
a
risk
factor
for
prevalent
DM
among
HIV-infected adults, when compared with the general
US adult population, HIV-infected adults may have
higher DM prevalence at younger ages and in the
absence of obesity. Healthcare providers caring for
HIV-infected patients should follow existing DM screen-
ing guidelines. Given the large burden of DM among
HIV-infected adults, additional research would help to
determine whether DM screening guidelines should be
modified to include HIV infection as a risk factor for
DM and to identify optimal management strategies in
this population.
