Abstract Lateralization is a fundamental principle of nervous system organization but its
molecular determinants are mostly unknown. In humans, asymmetric gene expression in the fetal
cortex has been suggested as the molecular basis of handedness. However, human fetuses already
show considerable asymmetries in arm movements before the motor cortex is functionally linked to
the spinal cord, making it more likely that spinal gene expression asymmetries form the molecular
basis of handedness. We analyzed genome-wide mRNA expression and DNA methylation in
cervical and anterior thoracal spinal cord segments of five human fetuses and show development-
dependent gene expression asymmetries. These gene expression asymmetries were epigenetically
regulated by miRNA expression asymmetries in the TGF-b signaling pathway and lateralized
methylation of CpG islands. Our findings suggest that molecular mechanisms for epigenetic
regulation within the spinal cord constitute the starting point for handedness, implying a
fundamental shift in our understanding of the ontogenesis of hemispheric asymmetries in humans.

Introduction
Compared to the almost infinite complexity of vertebrate cognition and behavior, the number of
genes influencing central nervous system development is staggeringly small (Kadakkuzha and
Puthanveettil, 2013). Thus, understanding the molecular mechanism underlying the epigenetics of
vertebrate central nervous system architecture has become an issue central to neuroscience
(Kundakovic and Champagne, 2015).
One fundamental principle of brain organization is lateralization, i.e. structural or functional dif-
ference between the left and the right hemisphere of the brain (Corballis, 2014). Lateralization is a

 conserved feature across the vertebrate lineage (Stro
¨ckens et al., 2013; Ocklenburg et al., 2013a;
Bisazza et al., 1998; Rogers et al., 2012; Versace and Vallortigara, 2015) and recent studies
strongly suggest it is also present in invertebrates (Frasnelli et al., 2012). This ubiquity of behav-
ioral and brain lateralization strongly supports the idea that lateralized central nervous system orga-
nization provides an evolutionary advantage (Vallortigara and Rogers, 2005). Suggestions about
why a lateralized brain would increase an organism’s fitness include avoidance of unnecessary dupli-
cation of neuronal activity in both hemispheres, faster neuronal processing due to not being con-
strained by slow callosal transfer of information between the hemispheres and better coordination
of unilateral behaviors in swarms or other social groups of animals (Vallortigara and Rogers, 2005;
Corballis, 2009). In humans, hemispheric asymmetries have been shown in almost all major cogni-
tive systems (Ocklenburg et al., 2014a) including language (Friederici, 2011; Sepeta et al., 2016),
memory (Giammattei and Arndt, 2012; Tat and Azuma, 2016; Habib et al., 2003), attention
(Falasca et al., 2015; Duecker et al., 2013), emotional processing (Demaree et al., 2005), face
perception (De Winter et al., 2015), working memory (Langel et al., 2014; Nagel et al., 2013) and
executive functions (Ocklenburg et al., 2011a, 2012; Stock and Beste, 2014).
By far the most widely investigated manifestation of lateralization in humans is handedness
(Corballis, 2014). Importantly, handedness is related to the lateralized organization of cognitive
systems in the human brain (Ocklenburg et al., 2014b; Fra
¨ssle et al., 2016). For example, left-
hemispheric language dominance is found in 96% of right-handed subjects, but only in 73% of left-
handed subjects (Knecht et al., 2000). The relevance of handedness has recently been highlighted
by Willems et al. (Willems et al., 2014), who state that it is one of the most important factors
influencing the individual brain organization and that explicit inclusion of left-handers in experimen-
tal studies has strongly improved our understanding of language, motor behavior and visual proc-
essing. Handedness might not only be a behavioral proxy for individual brain organization, but is
also interesting from a clinical perspective: A variety of neuropsychiatric and developmental disor-
ders like autism spectrum disorders (Colby and Parkison, 1977; Forrester et al., 2014;
Preslar et al., 2014; Rysstad and Pedersen, 2016), depression (Denny, 2009; Elias et al., 2001;
Logue et al., 2015), bipolar disorder (van Dyck et al., 2012; Nowakowska et al., 2008), anxiety
disorders (Logue et al., 2015; Hicks and Pellegrini, 1978; Orme, 1970; Wright and Hardie,
2012; Hardie et al., 2016; Lyle et al., 2013), schizophrenia (Hirnstein and Hugdahl, 2014;
Dragovic
and
Hammond,
2005;
Sommer
et
al.,
2001)
or
alcoholism
(Denny,
2011;
Mandal et al., 2000; Sperling et al., 2000) has been associated with left- and mixed-handedness.
Thus, understanding the ontogenesis of handedness and hemispheric asymmetries in general could
potentially yield important insights into pathogenesis of these disorders.
However, despite their importance for many aspects of brain organization, the ontogenetic back-
ground of brain asymmetries is still far from being understood. Initially, single gene theories have
been suggested to explain the emergence of handedness as a function of one gene with two alleles
(Annett, 1998; McManus, 1985). However, recent genome wide association studies failed to detect
any genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms, refuting single gene theories
(Armour et al., 2014; Eriksson et al., 2010). Candidate gene studies revealed a number of genes
that display an association with handedness, among them leucine rich repeat transmembrane neuro-
nal 1 (LRRTM1) (Francks et al., 2007), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 6 (PCSK6)
(Scerri et al., 2011; Arning et al., 2013; Brandler et al., 2013) and the androgen receptor gene
(AR) (Arning et al., 2015; Hampson and Sankar, 2012; Medland et al., 2005). However, these
genes explain only a fraction of the variance in handedness data. Moreover, a number of studies has
suggested that only about one quarter of the variance in handedness is attributed to genetic varia-
tion, whereas the remaining 75% of variance are explained by non-shared environmental factors
(Medland et al., 2006, 2009; Vuoksimaa et al., 2009). These findings highlight the importance of
integrating both genetic variation and epigenetic processes modulating gene expression when
investigating the ontogenesis of hemispheric asymmetries (Geschwind and Miller, 2001).
Asymmetric gene expression in the fetal cortex has been suggested as the molecular basis of left-
right differences in hand-use: Sun et al. (Sun et al., 2005) compared gene expression levels in the
right and left perisylvian cortex of the human fetus. At 12 gestational weeks, the authors identified
27 consistently asymmetrically expressed genes, which are mostly responsible for gene expression
regulation, signal transduction, and cortical development. One of the consistently asymmetrically
expressed genes was LIM Domain Only 4 (LMO4). Further investigation revealed that unilateral

 variation of Lmo4 expression in embryonic mice suppresses neurogenesis in one hemisphere, leading
to the asymmetric functional area formation, neuronal production and axonal projection as well as
altered paw preference (Li et al., 2013). Analysis of gene expression in the adult human brain
yielded less clear results, since two independent studies found no differences in gene expression

regions

hemispheres
(Hawrylycz
et
al.,
2012;
Pletikos et al., 2014). In a recent study, Karlebach and Francks reanalyzed both datasets and
showed that subtle lateralization at single gene level translates to stronger asymmetries at the level
of functional gene ontology (GO) groups. The authors found lateralized gene sets to be associated
with neuronal electrophysiology, synaptic transmission, nervous system development, and glutamate
receptor activity (Karlebach and Francks, 2015).
However, recent research indicates that cortical tissue might not be the optimal choice to investi-
gate the relation of gene expression asymmetries and behavioral asymmetries. Ontogenetically,
handedness starts early in development since coordinated hand movements begin 8 weeks post
conception (PC), i.e. 10 weeks gestational age, when 85% of fetuses exhibit more right arm than left
arm movements (Hepper et al., 1998; de Vries et al., 1985). Investigation of thumb sucking in 274
fetuses revealed that at 13 weeks PC 90% prefer to suck their right thumb whereas only 10% suck
their left thumb more often (Hepper et al., 1990, 1991). Interestingly, a follow up study of 75
infants revealed that thumb sucking preference is significantly positively correlated with subsequent
handedness: The 60 children showing a right thumb preference were right-handed whereas out of
the 15 children displaying a left thumb preference, five were right-handed and 10 were left-handed
(Hepper et al., 2005). Importantly, the motor cortex is not yet functionally linked to the spinal cord
at that stage of development as the outgrowth of corticospinal projections does not enter the ante-
rior spinal cord before 15 weeks PC (ten Donkelaar et al., 2004). This implies that handedness is
unlikely to be under brain control (Hepper et al., 1991) and asymmetrical hand movements have to
arise from spinal activity patterns. Thus, it is likely that spinal rather than cortical gene expression
asymmetries represent the molecular basis of handedness.
Asymmetrical gene expression patterns are likely to be influenced by epigenetic variation. The
most important epigenetic mechanism is DNA methylation. Binding of methyl (-CH3) groups to CpG
sites or islands causes a reduction or prevention of transcription and thus gene expression. DNA
methylation is confirmed to be involved in the development of basic central nervous system func-
tions like synaptic function, neuronal plasticity, learning and memory (Nikolova and Hariri, 2015;
Day et al., 2015; Roth, 2012). Especially intrauterine stressors have been shown to influence DNA
methylation (Turecki and Meaney, 2016; Vaiserman, 2015), which is particularly interesting in the
context of handedness ontogenesis. Moreover, a recent study showed that methylation plays a role
in the ontogenesis of handedness: methylation levels in a CpG block in the promoter region of
LRRTM1 were associated with atypical handedness (Leach et al., 2014).
Post-transcriptionally, gene expression is further regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs) that are com-
posed of small, 21–25 nucleotide, non-coding RNAs. In humans and other mammals, miRNAs pri-
marily cause destabilization of target mRNAs instead of reduced translation (Guo et al., 2010). This
has also been shown to be relevant for hemispheric asymmetries, as neuronal asymmetries in the
nematode Caenorhabditis elegans are controlled for by different miRNAs (Alqadah et al., 2013;
Cochella and Hobert, 2012; Johnston and Hobert, 2003; Hsieh et al., 2012).
Pronounced changes in spatiotemporal expression profiles are a key feature of human embryo-
genesis (Yi et al., 2010) and formation of functional asymmetries in vertebrates has been shown
to strongly depend on critical periods in early development (Le Grand et al., 2003; Zappia and
Rogers, 1983). To investigate the molecular determinants of human behavioral asymmetries we
analyzed asymmetries in genome-wide mRNA expression, miRNA expression and DNA methyla-
tion patterns in human fetal spinal cord tissue. Importantly, we specifically wanted to investigate
the spinal cord segments innervating arms and hands. While rostral cervical segments (C2–C5)
innervate the head, neck and shoulder region, the subsequent segments directly innervate arms
and hands with C6 innervating the thumb, C7 innervating the middle finger and C8 innervating
the little finger. T1 innervates the medial site of the antecubital fossa (Maynard et al., 1997).
Based on the findings on the start of left-right asymmetries in coordinated hand movements
(Hepper et al., 1998; de Vries et al., 1985), we focused on fetal tissue samples obtained
between 8 and 12 weeks PC.

 We hypothesized that gene expression asymmetries between the left and right spinal cord start
at 8 weeks PC, as this is the starting point of coordinated asymmetrical hand movements. Based on
the findings about the role of non-genetic influence factors for handedness development, we also
assumed a pronounced modulation of these mRNA expression asymmetries by asymmetric DNA
methylation and asymmetric miRNA expression.
Results
Gene expression
Asymmetries in mRNA expression in spinal cord segments C2 to T2 were observed at all three devel-
opmental stages, with the largest differences evident at 8 weeks PC. At 8 weeks PC, 1690 transcripts
(3.29%) showed left-right gene expression differences with log2(fold change) > 1.5. The fact that 39
transcripts showed stronger left-sided gene expression, while 1651 transcripts showed stronger
right-sided gene expression highlights increased right-sided gene expression in the spinal cord at
this developmental stage. The number of asymmetrically expressed genes with a log2(fold
change) > 1.5 was reduced to only 24 genes (0.05%) at 10 weeks PC. Among these, 15 displayed
leftward asymmetrical gene expression and nine showed rightward asymmetrical gene expression.
Four genes (0.01%) showed a log2(fold change) of 1.5 or higher (see Figure 1 for top 25 asymmetri-
cally expressed genes per developmental stage and Supplementary file 1G for individual samples)
at 12 weeks PC, all indicating stronger gene expression in the right spinal cord. Among the candi-
date genes associated with the development of hemispheric asymmetries (see Figure 2A), forkhead
box P2 (FOXP2) (Ocklenburg et al., 2013b) displayed a rightward asymmetry in the spinal cord at
10 weeks PC. BDNF antisense RNA (BDNF-AS) (Manns et al., 2008) was higher expressed in the left
spinal cord at 8 weeks PC.
GO groups
Recently, it has been suggested that subtle expression asymmetries at the level of individual genes
may translate to stronger asymmetries within the gene ontology (GO) groups (Karlebach and
Francks, 2015). The number of significant GO groups (p<0.05) as displayed by enrichment analysis
over asymmetrically expressed genes per hemisphere and developmental stage was the highest at 8
weeks PC (123 overall). For the 69 transcripts showing asymmetrical gene expression towards the
left spinal cord, WebGestalt revealed three enriched GO groups: Platelet-derived growth factor
binding (p<0.05), collagen (p<0.05), and fibrillary collagen (p<0.05). In contrast, for the 1651 tran-
scripts showing asymmetrical gene expression towards the right spinal cord, GO analysis revealed
120 enriched GO groups displaying particular involvement in biological processes like cell cycle
(p<0.001), cellular component organization or biogenesis (p<0.001), and metabolic processes
(p<0.001). Enriched molecular functions include protein binding (p<0.001), transferase activity
(p<0.001), and protein binding transcription factor activity (p<0.001). The number of significant GO
groups was reduced at 10 weeks PC (41 overall): The 15 genes showing leftward asymmetric gene
expression cluster in 4 GO categories representing cellular components: DNA-directed RNA poly-
merase II, holoenzyme (p<0.05), nuclear DNA-directed RNA polymerase complex (p<0.05), RNA
polymerase complex (p<0.05), and DNA-directed RNA polymerase complex (p<0.05). GO catego-
ries enriched in the nine genes asymmetrically expressed towards the right spinal cord include sys-
tem development (p<0.05), regulation of reproductive process (p<0.05), cell proliferation (p<0.05),
and multicellular organismal process (p<0.05). At 12 weeks PC, no GO group reached statistical sig-
nificance (see Figure 2B–C and related Figure 2—source data 1).
miRNA
At 8 weeks PC, 301 miRNA transcripts were expressed in both the left and the right spinal cord. Out
of those, five (1.66%) showed a biologically relevant asymmetry towards the right spinal cord. At 10
weeks PC, six of 382 transcripts (1.57%) displayed a log2(fold change) > 1.5, thereof three leftwards
and three rightwards. At 12 weeks PC, seven of 294 expressed transcripts (2.38%) were differentially
expressed with six being more strongly expressed in the left spinal cord and one being more
strongly expressed in the right spinal cord (see Figure 3A and related Figure 3—source data 1).
For each developmental stage, target genes of asymmetrically expressed miRNA transcripts were

 compared to asymmetrically expressed genes. At 8 weeks PC, 65 of the 1690 asymmetrically
expressed genes (3.85%) were likely to be targets of asymmetrically expressed miRNA transcripts.
At 10 weeks PC, six of the 24 asymmetrically expressed genes (25%) were targets of differentially
expressed miRNAs. At 12 weeks PC, one of the four asymmetrically expressed genes (25%) was a
target of the asymmetrically expressed miRNAs of that developmental stage. For the miRNAs asym-
metrically expressed towards the right spinal cord at 8 weeks PC, 12 KEGG pathways reached FDR-
corrected significance. By far the largest effect was observed for the Transforming growth factor
beta (TGF-b) signaling pathway (p<0.001), which all five miRNAs asymmetrically expressed towards
the right spinal cord were involved in. Additionally, among the 10 genes involved in this pathway,
two (SP1, SMAD3) were differentially expressed at 8 weeks PC. At 10 weeks PC, four pathways
reached FDR-corrected significance (two left, two right). For 12 weeks PC, 16 pathways were
detected in KEGG analyses (14 left, two right).
DNA methylation
At 8 weeks PC, 31,278 CpG sites showed higher DNA methylation (FDR-corrected p-value below
0.01 and the % methylation difference between left and right above 25%) in the left spinal cord over
both samples, whereas only 8615 CpG sites were more extensively methylated in the right spinal
cord of both samples. At 10 weeks PC, 10,892 CpG sites showed side-specific asymmetrical DNA
methylation towards the left side and 11,081 towards the right side of both samples (see Figure 3B–
C and related Figure 3—source data 4). At 12 weeks PC, for which only one sample was available,
281,119 CpG sites showed higher DNA methylation in the left and 352,118 in the right spinal cord.
Comparing the methylation data to gene expression data revealed that at 8 weeks PC, 451 of 1690
asymmetrically expressed genes were asymmetrically methylated towards the opposite direction,
thus, 27% of the variance in asymmetrical gene expression could be explained by differential methyl-
ation alone. Moreover, 1% of variance (18 genes) could be explained by the asymmetrical miRNA
expression as well as differential methylation and 3% of variance (47 genes) could be explained by
miRNA alone, which leaves 69% of variance unexplained (Figure 3D). At 10 weeks PC, 25% of vari-
ance in asymmetrical gene expression (six genes) could be explained by miRNA alone, followed by
methylation (8%, two genes). 67% of variance remained unexplained. At 12 weeks PC, 25% of vari-
ance (one gene) was explained by miRNA and 25% (one gene) by methylation. 50% of variance
remained unexplained at 12 weeks PC.
Discussion
Hemispheric asymmetries in brain and behavior are a major organizational principle in the vertebrate
central nervous system, but their ontogenesis is not well understood (Ocklenburg et al., 2014b).
While

that
both
genetic
and

factors
play
a
role
(Ocklenburg et al., 2013c), it is unclear, which molecular processes underlie the epigenetic modula-
tion of gene expression asymmetries, a potential origin of behavioral asymmetries (Sun et al., 2005;
Karlebach and Francks, 2015). To elucidate this question we analyzed asymmetries in genome-
wide mRNA expression, miRNA expression and DNA methylation patterns in human fetal tissue sam-
ples. Importantly, we focused on spinal cord, not brain, tissue. Eight weeks after conception, human
fetuses exhibit pronounced lateralized motor behavior of the arms. As cortical control of this behav-
ior is unlikely (Hepper et al., 1998; de Vries et al., 1985; Hepper et al., 2005; ten Donkelaar
et al., 2004), it has been suggested that it is under spinal control (Hepper, 2013).

 In line with our hypothesis, our findings suggest that gene expression asymmetries in the spinal
cord segments innervating the hands and arms might be critical for the ontogenesis of functional
asymmetries. For the first time we show that the left and right cervical and anterior thoracal seg-
ments of the fetal spinal cord do show biologically relevant gene expression differences. Impor-
tantly, these gene expression asymmetries are highly developmental stage-specific. At eight weeks
after conception, gene expression asymmetries between the two halves of the spinal cord were
most pronounced, with 3.29% of all transcripts showing biologically relevant left-right gene expres-
sion differences, largely higher towards the right side and involved in numerous GO categories con-
tributing to neurodevelopment. At 10 weeks PC, this number decreased substantially to 0.05% and
further so at 12 weeks PC (0.01%). While the findings for 10 and 12 weeks PC are largely comparable
to what has been reported for gene expression asymmetries in the fetal cerebral cortex (Sun et al.,
2005; Karlebach and Francks, 2015), the data for eight weeks PC indicate a substantial increase
over previous reports of gene expression asymmetries in CNS tissue that goes along with the first
onset of coordinated hand movements.
In line with the suggestion that non-shared environmental influences account for more than 75%
of the variance in functional hemispheric asymmetries in humans (Medland et al., 2009), we could
show that a large part of these gene expression asymmetries is regulated by epigenetic processes.
On the one hand, we could show that DNA methylation of CpG islands shows substantial asym-
metries that are related to RNA expression asymmetries. In week 8 tissue samples, there was a
strong left-lateralization of CpG island methylation, indicating a stronger repression of gene tran-
scription in the left spinal cord. This is well in line with our finding of increased overall right-sided
gene expression at that time point. Direct comparison of the location of asymmetrically methylated
CpG islands and asymmetrically expressed genes indicated that 27% of the variance in asymmetrical
gene expression at week 8 could be explained by differential methylation. In week 10 tissue samples,
methylation asymmetries are massively decreased as compared to week eight, also in line with the
gene expression data. Week 12 is difficult to interpret as here only one sample was analyzed, greatly
increasing the number of asymmetrically methylated CpG sites.
On the other hand, we could also show that the asymmetries in gene expression are modulated
by miRNA expression asymmetries. Particularly interesting was our finding that for the miRNAs
asymmetrically expressed towards the right spinal cord at week eight, KEGG pathway analysis
revealed a substantial effect of the TGF-b signaling pathway. This is an intriguing finding, as both
nodal growth differentiation factor (Nodal) and left-right determination factor (Lefty), two of the key
proteins for establishing bodily left–right asymmetry during development are part of the TGF-b
superfamily (Mittwoch, 2008; Shiratori and Hamada, 2014). Importantly, TGF-b signaling has
directly been linked to handedness, as proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 6 (PCSK6), one of
the major candidate genes for handedness, encodes for a protease that cleaves NODAL
(Scerri et al., 2011).
Our data collection was limited to weeks 8 to 12 PC and for future studies, it could potentially be
interesting to include tissue samples from even earlier stages to get a more detailed picture of the
developmental trajectory. Also, independent replication in larger samples is needed in order to
make more in-depth functional conclusions. As limb preferences have been reported in many non-
human primates, but the strong 90 to 10 distribution of right- and left-handedness in humans seems
to be rather unique, comparative analysis of primate tissue samples might yield unique insights into
the evolution of the molecular basis of hemispheric asymmetries.
One potential issue with the interpretation of our data is to what extent the observed gene
expression asymmetries are linked to visceral situs and not necessarily nervous system asymmetries.
A particular interesting experiment in this regard would be to investigate spinal cord gene expres-
sion asymmetries in the inversus viscerum (iv) line of mouse mutants (Okada et al., 1999). These
mutants show randomized visceral laterality and by comparing spinal cord gene expression asymme-
tries between animals with normal and atypical visceral asymmetries a potential impact of visceral
asymmetries on spinal cord gene expression could easily be identified.

 Taken together, these results are a strong indicator of epigenetic influences on human spinal
cord gene expression asymmetries, a potential precursor of handedness. In birds, it has been shown
that a behavioral preference for turning the head to the right, caused by epigenetic modulation dur-
ing a critical period just before hatch, induces not only motor, but also visual and cognitive asymme-
tries (Casey and Martino, 2000; Manns and Gu
¨ntu
¨rku
¨n, 2009; Rogers, 1982; Skiba et al., 2002).
Based on our data, a similar model is conceivable in humans. As week eight after conception repre-
sents the onset of coordinated hand movements and behavioral asymmetries of the hands occur first
at this time point (Hepper et al., 1998; de Vries et al., 1985), we assume that a certain time frame
before 10 weeks PC represents the critical period for handedness formation. During this period,
asymmetrical DNA methylation and posttranscriptional regulation by asymmetrically expressed miR-
NAs lead to a spike in RNA expression asymmetries in the spinal segments innervating the arms and
hands. These expression asymmetries of genes relevant for CNS development could lead to a differ-
ential development of neuronal circuits influencing the right arm and hand, causing the described
behavioral asymmetries. For example, it has been shown that spinal cord segments innervating the
right arm contain motoneurons with larger somata than left arm segments. In contrast, there are no
size differences in left and right segments innervating the upper trunk (Melsbach et al., 1996). Fur-
thermore, at eight weeks PC, the spinal cord and motor cortex are functionally not connected
(ten Donkelaar et al., 2004), also supporting that behavioral asymmetries in arm use at that stage
are controlled for by the spinal cord. At a later developmental stage when the spinal cord and motor
cortex are functionally connected, the established behavioral asymmetry then could lead to asymme-
tries in use-dependent neuronal plasticity processes (Cirillo et al., 2010) in the motor cortex, ulti-
mately leading to the cortical correlates of handedness (Ocklenburg et al., 2013c). This process
could start at around 14 weeks PC, as asymmetric fetal hand use at that stage strongly correlates
with later handedness at school age (Hepper et al., 1990, 2005). Unlike models assuming that
handedness
is
primarily
controlled
by
allelic
variations
in
one
or
more
candidate
genes
(Annett, 1998), our suggestion is in line with the finding that more than 75% of the variance in hand-
edness data is explained for by non-shared environmental influences (Medland et al., 2009). More-
over, our data do not contradict neither linkage studies in extended left-handed pedigrees nor
genome-wide association studies which were unable to identify allelic variants that explain more
than a fraction of the variance in handedness data (Armour et al., 2014; Eriksson et al., 2010;
Somers et al., 2015). Whereas our findings suggest that a large part of these influencing factors act
prenatally, there remain several important peri- and postnatal environmental factors like social mod-
ulation to shape actual handedness (Schaafsma et al., 2009).
In summary, we could show pronounced, time sensitive gene expression asymmetries in human
fetal spinal tissue that overlap with the onset of behavioral asymmetries. Thus, our data suggest a
spinal, not a cortical, beginning of hemispheric asymmetries. The observed gene expression asym-
metries were modulated by asymmetric CpG island methylation and asymmetries in miRNA

 expression, suggesting that these processes form the molecular basis of asymmetry epigenetics. In
conclusion, our data strongly suggest a multifactorial model for the ontogenesis of hemispheric
asymmetries, including both multiple genetic and epigenetic factors.
Materials and methods
Sample collection
The human spinal cord was collected from fetal tissue discarded following induced pregnancy termi-
nation in a regional gynecology clinic. None of the physicians or other medical personnel involved in
conducting the pregnancy terminations was involved in this scientific study. The study was approved
by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of the Ruhr University Bochum (registration number
5056–14). All fetal tissue donors signed written informed consent at least 24 hr before the pregnancy
termination was conducted. Following informed consent, the handedness of fetal tissue donors was
determined using the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (EHI) (Oldfield, 1971).
Tissue preparation
Tissue samples were dissected from the spinal cord of six fetuses after pregnancy terminations at 8,
10, and 12 weeks post conception (PC), i.e. 10, 12 and 14 weeks gestational age. Due to ethical con-
siderations when working with aborted human fetal tissue, the sample size was limited to six fetuses
for which we got allowance by the Ethics Committee. This number was based on effects in previous
studies with fetal cortical tissue (Sun et al., 2005). Fetal pathologies were ruled out as far as possible
by excluding pregnancy terminations due to medical indications as well as karyotype aberrations.
The samples were also excluded in case of heavily destructed tissue. Following pregnancy termina-
tion, fetal and surrounding tissue was immediately rinsed with sterile 1x phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) in order to hold ion concentrations constant while blood was removed. In case the spine was
detectable, it was fixed with sterile cannulas with a diameter of 0.6 mm (B Braun, Melsungen, Ger-
many) and opened longitudinally with ball-ended dissecting scissors. In order to differentiate left
and right, the right spinal cord was marked with small injections of 1% cresyl violet. Tissue samples
were stored in 1 ml Allprotect Tissue Reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Spinal cord tissue prepa-
ration was conducted as quickly as possible to ensure that RNA was not degraded (7:50–16:40 min,
see Supplementary file 1A). Subsequently, 50–100 mg of chorionic villi were removed and stored
in 10 ml of RPMI 1640 Medium (Life Technologies GmbH, Carlsbad, California) for subsequent karyo-
gram analysis. All tissue samples were transported to Ruhr University Bochum, Germany. Spinal cord
samples were stored at 4˚C to preserve the gene expression profile. 24 hr later, the upper third of
the spinal cord was separated on a Teflon freezing plate in order to include spinal cord segments C2
to T2. The left and right spinal cord were dissected by separating the tissue longitudinally along the
midline and restored in the Allprotect Tissue Reagent at �80˚C.
Karyotyping
Karyograms were assembled at the Department of Human Genetics (Ruhr University Bochum) to
ensure that karyotypes were normal without major chromosomal aberrations. Cell cultures were incu-
bated with 1 mg colcemid (Gibco, Karlsruhe, Germany) for 80 min and were then harvested from
flask applying trypsin-EDTA (0.05/0.02 w/v) (Biochrome, Berlin, Germany) for 2–4 min. After transfer-
ring to tube and centrifugation (170 g for 10 min) cells were incubated in 0.56% KCl hypotonic solu-
tion for 20 min and subsequently fixed and washed using a 3:1 methanol–glacial acetic acid fixative.
After spreading on slides and air drying samples were stained in 0.025% quinacrine hydrochloride
(Sigma, Steinheim, Germany) for 20 min. Q bands were visualized on a Zeiss Axioskop 2 fluorescent
microscope and 100 metaphases per sample were analyzed in Ikaros software (Metasystems, Altlus-
sheim, Germany).
Assessment of RNA and DNA
Total RNA including miRNA and DNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal
Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Concentration and
purity of RNA and DNA were determined photometrically (NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer,
Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts). RNA quality was controlled using the Agilent RNA

Neuroscience
 6000 Pico Kit and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California) according
to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Extracted RNA and DNA were stored at �80˚C until gene
expression analysis was performed. For RNA and DNA quality measurements see Supplementary
files 1B–C.
Gene expression analysis and bioinformatics
‘INVIEW Transcriptome Discover’ provided by GATC Biotech AG (Konstanz, Germany) was used to
analyze the extracted mRNA. Sample VI did not pass entry quality control and was not further proc-
essed. For the remaining samples, rRNA was depleted from total RNA for purification and subse-
quent fragmentation of mRNA into RNA-Seq reads. A strand-specific cDNA-library was generated
for subsequent Illumina paired-end sequencing with 60 million reads. The RNA-Seq reads were
aligned to the reference genome (Homo sapiens, hg19) using Bowtie (RRID:SCR_005476). Read sta-
tistics are reported in Supplementary files 1D–E. Potential exon-exon splice junctions were discov-
ered (TopHat, RRID:SCR_013035). The software Cufflinks (RRID:SCR_013307) (Trapnell et al., 2010)
then recognized and quantified transcripts, which were merged to full length transcripts and anno-
tated. Cuffdiff (RRID:SCR_001647) tracked the mapped reads and determined the relative gene
expression value (fragment per kilo base of transcript per million fragments mapped [FPKM]) for
each transcript in each sample.
Overall, gene expression was investigated in 51,408 transcripts in left and right spinal cord of five
samples. Asymmetric gene expression was determined for annotated genes, which were identified
using the RefSeq database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/; RRID:SCR_003496). Differential
gene expression is usually reported as a fold change in FPKM. In case of very small FPKM values the
fold change is likely to be high although the difference in gene expression is small (Warden et al.,
2013), so a gene was considered as abundant if FPKM was at least 1. The number of protein coding
genes with an FPKM-threshold of 1 on both sides was slightly lower in sample II (9102, 17.7%) than
in the other samples (I: 10,618, 20.7%, III: 10,970, 21.3%, IV: 10,854, 21.1%, V: 10,989, 21.4%). Due
to the small sample size, differential gene expression for 8 and 10 weeks PC was determined by fold
change of means using a threshold of log2(fold change) > 1.5. This value is commonly acknowledged
to indicate a gene expression difference with possible functional relevance (Hawrylycz et al., 2012).
At 12 weeks PC, only one sample was included and genes with a log2(fold change) > 1.5 of FPKM
values were considered as asymmetrically expressed.
After the initial analysis on the single gene level, we targeted candidate genes that had previously
been associated with the development of hemispheric asymmetries: LRRTM1 (Francks et al., 2007),
PCSK6 (Scerri et al., 2011; Arning et al., 2013; Brandler et al., 2013), meiosis specific nuclear
structural 1 (MNS1) (Brandler et al., 2013), polycystin 2, transient receptor potential cation channel
(PKD2)
(Brandler
et
al.,
2013),
AR
(Arning
et
al.,
2015;
Hampson
and
Sankar,
2012;
Medland et al., 2005), SET domain bifurcated 2 (SETDB2) (Ocklenburg et al., 2016), and catechol-
O-methyltransferase (COMT) (Savitz et al., 2007) have been reported as specific candidate genes
for handedness, whereas glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA type subunit 2B (GRIN2B)
(Ocklenburg et al., 2011b), FOXP2 (Ocklenburg et al., 2013b; Pinel et al., 2012), KIAA031945
(Pinel et al., 2012), and cholecystokinin A receptor (CCKAR) (Ocklenburg et al., 2013d) have been
associated with language lateralization. Other genes associated with left-right differentiation are
left-right determination factor 1 (LEFTY1) (Mittwoch, 2008) and nodal growth differentiation factor
(NODAL) (Mittwoch, 2008), BDNF (Manns et al., 2008), LIM homeobox 1 (LHX1) (Tsang et al.,
1999), and bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7) (Abu-Khalil et al., 2004). Among these, AR and
NODAL were not expressed above the detection level at any developmental stage.
In order to identify functional groups of asymmetrically expressed genes, we used WebGestalt
(RRID:SCR_006786) (Wang et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2005) to carry out an enrichment analysis over
all genes with a log2(fold change) > 1.5 per hemisphere and developmental stage with respect to
GO groups (biological process, molecular function, cellular component).
miRNA expression analysis and bioinformatics
The amount of RNA for miRNA sequencing was only sufficient in sample II, IV, and V (see
Supplementary file 1B). The service ’Regulome sequencing’ of GATC Biotech AG provided the
analysis of miRNA and included the generation of a small- / miRNA-library for subsequent Illumina

 single-read sequencing with 5 million reads as well as identification of common miRNAs with corre-
sponding expression values (read counts). Originally, all samples yielded between 618 and 858
expressed miRNAs (sample II: 638 left, 858 right; sample IV: 838 left, 799 right; sample V: 618 left,
658 right). miRNAs with less than 10 read counts on both sides of the spinal cord were removed
from analysis to prevent unrealistically high fold changes (Hu et al., 2011), which left 300 miRNA
transcripts for sample II, 381 transcripts for sample IV, and 293 transcripts for sample V. In contrast
to pure read counts, RPKM (reads per kilo base of exon model per million mapped reads) values cor-
rect for sequencing depth and gene length, so RPKM was calculated (RPKM = [109 � reads mapped
to the transcript)/(total number of reads in the library � transcript length] [Kazemian et al., 2015]).
Differential miRNA expression was defined as a minimum log2(fold change) of 1.5. Using Mirpath
v3.0 (Vlachos et al., 2015), we identified genes that were likely (probability of interaction > 0.8) to
be targeted by the asymmetrically expressed miRNA transcripts, which were then compared to the
differentially expressed genes. Variance in asymmetrical gene expression was considered to be
explained by miRNA if asymmetrically expressed genes were targets of asymmetrically expressed
miRNAs. Additionally, we performed KEGG (RRID:SCR_012773) analyses (Vlachos et al., 2015) to
identify biological pathways regulated by asymmetrically expressed miRNA transcripts.
Methylation analysis and bioinformatics
DNA was bisulfite treated and adapter and primer sequences as well as bases with a phred quality
score lower than Q15 were removed. After transformation into a C-to-T and G-to-A version, BIS-
MARK (RRID:SCR_005604) (Krueger and Andrews, 2011) and Bowtie2 (Langmead et al., 2009)
were applied on the sequence reads in order to align them to the in silico converted reference
(Homo sapiens, hg19), which was refined using Bis-SNP (RRID:SCR_005439) (Liu et al., 2012)
adopted GATK (RRID:SCR_001876) (McKenna et al., 2010; DePristo et al., 2011) modules. Bis-SNP
then simultaneously determined the genotypes and methylation rates at each CpG site using Bayes-
ian inference. DNA read statistics and methylation levels are reported in Supplementary file 1F.
The annotation was performed using the UCSC genome browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/.) for
detected CpG sites and using the RefSeq database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/) for genes.
Comparative methylation analysis (left vs. right) was performed by using Fishers exact test using the
R-package methylKit (RRID:SCR_005177) (Akalin et al., 2012). P-values were adjusted for false dis-
covery rate (FDR) using the SLIM method (Wang et al., 2011). CpG sites were considered as differ-
entially methylated if FDR-corrected p-value was below 0.01 and % methylation difference between
left and right was above 25%. For week 10 and 12, average % methylation difference was calculated
for every CpG site that was asymmetrically methylated in both samples, whereas for week 14, only
one sample was available. CpG sites were compared to asymmetrical gene expression data by
matching chromosome positions. For each asymmetrically expressed gene, the number of hyper-
methylated CpG sites in the left and in the right spinal cord within this gene and 1500 nucleotides
upstream was determined. A laterality quotient (LQ) was calculated [(right�left)/(right+left)*100] for
each gene. Variance in asymmetrical gene expression was considered to be explained by differential
methylation if methylation of CpG sites within one gene was strongly asymmetric (i.e. LQ > 25/LQ <
�25) towards the opposite direction of gene expression.
