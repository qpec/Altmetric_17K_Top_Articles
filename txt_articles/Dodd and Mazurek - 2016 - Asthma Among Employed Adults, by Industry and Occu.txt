 BRFSS is a state-based, random-digit–dialed telephone 
survey of the noninstitutionalized U.S. population aged 
≥18 years that collects information on health risk factors, 
preventive health practices, and disease status. The survey 
includes core questions, optional modules, and state-specific 
questions.† During 2013, the industry and occupation 
module§ was administered for the first time in 19 states. The 
module collected information on the industry and occupation 
of respondents employed in the 12 months preceding the 
interview for their current or most recent job. Two additional

Workers in various industries and occupations are at risk 
for work-related asthma* (1). Data from the 2006–2007 
adult Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 
Asthma Call-back Survey (ACBS), an in-depth asthma 
survey conducted with respondents who report an asthma 
diagnosis, from 33 states indicated that up to 48% of adult 
current asthma might be related to work and could therefore 
potentially be prevented (2). Identification of the industries 
and occupations with increased prevalence of asthma might 
inform work-related asthma intervention and prevention 
efforts. To assess the industry-specific and occupation-specific 
proportions of adults with current asthma by state, CDC 
analyzed data from the 2013 BRFSS industry and occupa-
tion module, collected from 21 states for participants aged 
≥18 years who, at the time of the survey interview, were 
employed or had been out of work for <12 months. Among 
these respondents, 7.7% had current asthma; based on the 
Asthma Call-back Survey results, this finding means as many 
as 2.7 million U.S. workers might have asthma caused by or 
exacerbated by workplace conditions. State-specific variations 
in the prevalence of current asthma by industry and occupa-
tion were observed. By state, current asthma prevalence was 
highest among workers in the information industry (18.0%) 
in Massachusetts and in health care support occupations 
(21.5%) in Michigan. Analysis of BRFSS industry and occu-
pation and optional asthma modules can be used to identify 
industries and occupations to assess for asthma among work-
ers, identify workplace exposures, and guide the design and 
evaluation of effective work-related asthma prevention and 
education programs (1).

* Work-related asthma includes occupational asthma (i.e., new-onset asthma 
caused by factors related to work) and work-exacerbated asthma (i.e., preexisting 
or concurrent asthma worsened by factors related to work). http://www.cdc.

states (Washington¶ and Wyoming**) collected industry and 
occupation information using state-added questions. The 
median American Association of Public Opinion Research 
response rate among the 21 states collecting information on 
industry and occupation was 44.0% (range = 31.1%–59.2%).††
BRFSS participants who responded “yes” to both questions: 
“Has a doctor, nurse, or other health professional ever told 
you that you had asthma?” and “Do you still have asthma?” 
were considered to have current asthma. Participants who, at 
the time of the interview, indicated that they were employed 
for wages, out of work for <1 year, or self-employed were 
considered employed in the 12 months before the interview. 
Information on respondent’s industry of employment and 
occupation was coded by CDC coders based on the 2002 
North American Industry Classification System and the 2000 
Standard Occupational Classification System, respectively.§§ 
The current analysis used 21 industry categories and 23 occu-
pation categories.
Landline and cellular telephone household data were 
weighted to produce estimates representative of the state 
populations using the survey sample weight for each BRFSS 
participant. Estimated proportions with corresponding 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Statistically sig-
nificant differences in distribution were determined using the 
Rao-Scott chi-square test with statistical significance at p≤0.05.
A sample of 208,788 adults in the 21 states, representing 
an estimated 125 million persons, participated in BRFSS 
and completed the industry and occupation module. Among 
these participants, 107,327 adults, representing an estimated 
74 million persons (59.8% of the estimated survey population) 
were employed in the 12 months before the interview during 
2013. Among adults employed at any time in the 12 months 
preceding the interview, 7.7% had current asthma.
The proportion of workers with current asthma differed 
significantly by age, sex, race/ethnicity, household income, 
and state (Table 1). Overall, prevalence of current asthma 
among workers ranged from 5.0% in Mississippi to 10.0% in 
Michigan, and was highest in the health care and social assis-
tance industry (10.7%) and in health care support occupations 
(12.4%) (Table 2). Industry-specific, and occupation-specific 
prevalence of current asthma was highest among workers in the 
information industry (18.0%) in Massachusetts and in health 
care support occupations (21.5%) in Michigan (Table 3). 
Among the five industries with the highest current asthma 
prevalence, health care and social assistance was identified in 
20 of the 21 states, retail trade in 16 states, and education in 
14 states. Among the five occupations with the highest cur-
rent asthma prevalence, office and administrative support was 
identified in 16 of the 21 states, health care practitioners and 
technical in 15 states, and sales and related in 13 states.

Discussion
The findings in this report provide the first state-specific esti-
mates of current asthma by industry and occupation category 
for 21 states administering BRFSS and collecting industry 
and occupation data, and indicate state-specific variations 
in current asthma prevalence by industry and occupation. 
These variations are consistent with previous findings (3) and 
likely reflect differences in the characteristics of state working 
populations (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, and education), socio-
economic factors (e.g., state-specific distribution of industries 
and occupations and unemployment rate), health insurance 
coverage (e.g., type of insurance and access to medical care), 
state laws (e.g., workers’ compensation), geographic differences 
in prevalence of sensitization to aeroallergens (4,5), and risk 
for exposure to agents causing asthma in the workplace. For 
example, sales and related occupations were the top employers 
in 2015 for all 21 states assessed in this study according to the 
Bureau of Labor and Statistics (http://www.bls.gov/home.htm) 
and that might explain why this occupation appears consis-
tently across several states.
Work-related asthma includes occupational asthma (i.e., 
new-onset asthma caused by factors related to work) and 
work-exacerbated asthma (i.e., preexisting or current asthma 
worsened by factors related to work) (1). Persons with work-
related asthma have more symptomatic days, use more health 
care resources, and have lower quality of life (6). Moreover, 
asthma exacerbations accelerate decline in lung function 
(7). Each of the industries and occupations identified in this 
report is associated with a specific set of existing and emerg-
ing workplace exposures, including irritant chemicals, dusts, 
secondhand smoke, allergens, emotional stress, temperature, 
and physical exertion, that have been associated with new-onset 
and work-exacerbated asthma (8,9). For example, it is well 
recognized that workers in the health care and social assis-
tance industry who are exposed to cleaning and disinfection 
products, powdered latex gloves, and aerosolized medications 
have a twofold increased likelihood of new-onset asthma (9). A 
previous study reported that as much as 48% of adult asthma 
is caused or made worse by work (2); therefore, as many as 
2.7 million workers might have asthma caused or exacerbated 
by workplace conditions in these 21 states. To assist clinicians 
in assessing potential workplace exposures among employed 
patients with new-onset or exacerbated asthma, the Association 
of Occupational and Environmental Clinics published a list of 
substances that meet criteria for causing work-related asthma 
by sensitization or acute irritant-induced asthma.¶¶
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limita-
tions. First, information on asthma was self-reported and not 
validated by medical records or follow-up with health care 
providers; thus, estimates might be subject to misclassifica-
tion. Second, although the BRFSS optional ACBS collects 
detailed information on asthma (e.g., work-related asthma), 
it was not possible to determine whether the current asthma 
was associated with work using 1 year of data because of the 
small number of respondents with both information on work-
related asthma diagnosis and industry and occupation. Also, 
small sample sizes resulted in unreliable estimates for some 
industries and occupations. Combining multiple years of data 
from ACBS and industry and occupation module is needed to 
estimate the state-specific work-related asthma prevalence by 
industry and occupation. Third, workers with current asthma 
might leave employment in industries and occupations with 
workplace exposures that exacerbate their asthma (i.e., the 
healthy worker effect); thus, industry and occupation in this 
report might not accurately represent the industries and occu-
pations where exposures occur. Finally, because data are limited 
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Data from the 2006–2007 adult Behavioral Risk Factor 
Surveillance System (BRFSS) Asthma Call-back Survey from 33 
states indicated that up to 48% of adult current asthma might 
be related to work and could potentially be prevented. Asthma 
prevalence is higher among adults working in certain industries 
and occupations.
What is added by this report?
Among an estimated 74 million adults employed at some time 
in the 12 months preceding the interview in 21 states, 7.7% had 
current asthma (range = 5.0% [Mississippi]–10.0% [Michigan]). 
Based on the Asthma Call-back Survey results, this finding 
means as many as 2.7 million U.S. workers might have asthma 
caused by or exacerbated by workplace conditions. The findings 
indicate state-specific variation in the prevalence of current 
asthma by industry and occupation. State-specific prevalence of 
current asthma was highest among workers in the information 
industry (18.0%) in Massachusetts and in health care support 
occupations (21.5%) in Michigan.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Analysis of BRFSS industry and occupation and asthma module 
data might aid in identification of industries and occupations 
with high current asthma prevalence and facilitate assessment 
of workers for new-onset or work-exacerbated asthma who 
could benefit from work-related asthma prevention and 
education programs. Routine collection of industry and 
occupation information is needed to estimate state-specific 
work-related asthma prevalence by industry and occupation.

to 21 states, the results might not be nationally representative 
or representative of nonparticipating states.
Physicians should consider collecting a detailed occu-
pational history among adults with asthma because this 
is critical for making a work-related asthma diagnosis and 
recommending optimal treatment and management (1). 
Reduction or elimination of workplace exposures (i.e., sub-
stitution of hazardous products with nonhazardous products 
or improved ventilation) or removal of the worker from the 
environment might be necessary for management of asthma 
symptoms related to work (1,10). For example, reduction in 
exposure to latex allergens by replacing powdered latex gloves 
with powder-free natural rubber latex or nonlatex gloves 
considerably reduced work-related asthma in the health care 
industry (10).
Twenty-two Healthy People 2020 respiratory disease 
objectives*** for asthma address prevention, detection, 
treatment, and education efforts; in 2009, CDC funded 
34 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico to 
help meet these objectives.††† The Council of State and 
Territorial Epidemiologists in its 2010 Position Statement§§§ 
recommends continued surveillance for and evaluation of 
the burden of asthma, including work-related asthma, to 
help target prevention programs and activities. BRFSS data 
provide a unique opportunity to assess state-level asthma 
prevalence by industry and occupation. The findings in this 
report might assist physicians and state public health officials 
in identifying workers in industries and occupations with a 
high current asthma prevalence who should be evaluated for 
work-related asthma in order to plan and target interventions. 
Potential work-related asthma exposures can be identified, 
and effective prevention and education strategies can 
be implemented (8). Routine collection of industry and 
occupation information is needed to estimate state-specific 
work-related asthma prevalence by respondents’ industry 
and occupation.
