IMPORTANCE After major policy changes in the United States, policymakers, health care
professionals, and the general public seek information about whether recreational cannabis
use is associated with physical health problems later in life.
OBJECTIVE To test associations between cannabis use over 20 years and a variety of physical
health indexes at early midlife.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Participants belonged to a representative birth cohort
of 1037 individuals born in Dunedin, New Zealand, in 1972 and 1973 and followed to age 38
years, with 95% retention (the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study).
We tested whether cannabis use from ages 18 to 38 years was associated with physical
health at age 38, even after controlling for tobacco use, childhood health, and childhood
socioeconomic status. We also tested whether cannabis use from ages 26 to 38 years was
associated with within-individual health decline using the same measures of health at
both ages.
EXPOSURES We assessed frequency of cannabis use and cannabis dependence at ages 18, 21,
26, 32, and 38 years.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We obtained laboratory measures of physical health
(periodontal health, lung function, systemic inflammation, and metabolic health), as well as
self-reported physical health, at ages 26 and 38 years.
RESULTS The 1037 study participants were 51.6% male (n = 535). Of these, 484 had ever used
tobacco daily and 675 had ever used cannabis. Cannabis use was associated with poorer
periodontal health at age 38 years and within-individual decline in periodontal health from
ages 26 to 38 years. For example, cannabis joint-years from ages 18 to 38 years was
associated with poorer periodontal health at age 38 years, even after controlling for tobacco
pack-years (β = 0.12; 95% CI, 0.05-0.18; P <.001). Additionally, cannabis joint-years from ages
26 to 38 years was associated with poorer periodontal health at age 38 years, even after
accounting for periodontal health at age 26 years and tobacco pack-years (β = 0.10; 95% CI,
0.05-0.16; P <.001) However, cannabis use was unrelated to other physical health problems.
Unlike cannabis use, tobacco use was associated with worse lung function, systemic
inflammation, and metabolic health at age 38 years, as well as within-individual decline in
health from ages 26 to 38 years.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Cannabis use for up to 20 years is associated with periodontal
disease but is not associated with other physical health problems in early midlife.

A
fter major policy changes in the United States, policy-
makers,healthcareprofessionals,andthegeneralpub-
lic seek information about whether recreational can-
nabis use is associated with physical health problems later in
life. Two recent reviews found that persistent cannabis use is
associated with few physical health problems, with the pos-
sible exceptions being cardiovascular risks and bronchitis.1,2
However, firm conclusions cannot be drawn due to method-
ological shortcomings.3 Most studies4-11 are cross-sectional or
rely on self-reported health. These designs cannot resolve the
temporalassociationbetweencannabisuseandhealth,norcan
they address the possibility that cannabis users may have bi-
ased perceptions of their health. Longitudinal studies with
laboratory-based measures and physical examinations are
needed.
Few longitudinal studies have characterized cannabis us-
ers’long-term health using objective, laboratory-based in-
dexes and examinations (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Each
study in eTable 1 in the Supplement focused on a single do-
main of physical health, providing an important but incom-
plete picture. In the present population-representative study
of individuals followed up from birth to age 38 years, we tested
associations between cannabis use over 20 years and mul-
tiple domains of physical health in early midlife. We selected
the following health domains based on prior research,1-3
demonstrated capacity to predict disease morbidity and
mortality,12-14 and biological plausibility of an effect of canna-
bis by early midlife: periodontal health, lung function, sys-
temic inflammation, and metabolic risk. First, we tested
whether cannabis use from ages 18 to 38 years was associated
with health at age 38 years. Second, we tested whether can-
nabis use from ages 26 to 38 years was associated with within-
individual health decline using the same measures of health
at both ages. To provide a benchmark for comparison, we also
tested associations between tobacco use and physical health.
Methods
Participants
Participants were members of the Dunedin Multidisciplinary
Health and Development Study of New Zealand, a longitudi-
nal investigation of health and behavior in a representative
birth cohort.15 Study members (n = 1037), representing 91.0%
of eligible births and 51.6% male, were all born in 1972-1973
in Dunedin, New Zealand. Of the 1037 study participants 51.6%
were male (n = 535). They were eligible for the longitudinal
studybasedonresidenceintheprovinceatage3yearsandpar-
ticipation in the first follow-up at age 3 years. The cohort rep-
resents the full range of socioeconomic status (SES) in the gen-
eral population of New Zealand’
s South Island and is primarily
white.15 On adult health, the cohort matches the New Zea-
land National Health and Nutrition Survey (eg, body mass in-
dex, smoking status, and general practitioner visits).15 Assess-
ments occurred at birth and ages 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 18, 21, 26,
32, and, most recently, 38 years, when 95.4% (n = 961) of the
1007 living study members took part. At each assessment
phase, study members are brought to the Dunedin Multidis-
ciplinary Health and Development Research Unit (Dunedin,
NewZealand)forinterviewsandexaminations.TheOtagoEth-
ics Committee (University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand)
approved each phase of the study, and the study protocol was
approved by the Otago Ethics Committee and the Duke Uni-
versity Institutional Review Board. Written informed con-
sent was obtained from all participants.
Analyses were limited to 947 study members with labo-
ratory health data at age 38 years because 46 study members
were not seen at age 38 years, 30 were deceased, and 14 had
field interviews that did not include laboratory measure-
ments or examinations. There were no differences between
those with and without health data at age 38 years on child-
hood health (F = 1.42, P = .23), cigarettes smoked per day at
age 18 years (F = 1.28, P = .26), or frequency of cannabis use
at age 18 years (F = 2.85, P = .09). Table 1 lists characteristics
of participants according to tobacco and cannabis exposure,
including sex, childhood health,16 and childhood SES,17 which
were available as covariates.
Tobacco Pack-Years
Cumulative tobacco exposure was calculated from the re-
ported number of cigarettes smoked per day at each assess-
ment divided by 20 and multiplied by the number of years
smoked at that rate through age 38 years. One pack-year re-
flects the equivalent of 20 cigarettes a day for 1 year. Mean (SD)
pack-years for those with age-38 health data was 6.17 (8.69).
For analyses testing associations between pack-years from age
26 to 38 and change in physical health using the same mea-
sureofhealthatbothages,weestimatedpack-yearsinthesame
way except that estimates represented cigarette use at ages 26
to 38 years (mean [SD], 3.30 [5.12] pack-years).
Cannabis Joint-Years
Pack-years, which combines information about smoking du-
ration and intensity, is the most commonly used exposure in
tobacco studies.18 We created a parallel variable that indexes
cannabissmoking.Cumulativejoint-yearswasestimatedusing
self-reported frequency of cannabis use over the past year (0-
365 days) at ages 18 to 38 years. One joint-year reflects the
equivalent of daily cannabis use for 1 year. Mean (SD) joint-
years between ages 18 to 38 years for those with age-38 health
Key Points
Question Is persistent cannabis use for up to 20 years associated
with physical health problems (periodontal health, lung function,
systemic inflammation, and metabolic health) in early midlife?
Findings In this prospective, longitudinal study of a
representative birth cohort of 1037 individuals, persistent
cannabis use from ages 18 to 38 years was not associated with
physical health problems at age 38 years with one exception:
persistent cannabis use was statistically significantly associated
with poor periodontal health.
Meaning Persistent cannabis use for up to 20 years is, for the
most part, not associated with physical health problems in early
midlife.

data was 1.99 (4.43). For analyses of health change from age
26 to 38 years, we estimated joint-years in the same way ex-
cept that estimates represented cannabis use at ages 26 to 38
(mean [SD], 1.18 [3.00]).
Persistent Cannabis Dependence
Because prior reports from the Dunedin Study have charac-
terized cannabis users in terms of persistent dependence over
time,19,20 we also report this variable as our exposure. We as-
sessed past-year dependence at ages 18 to 38 years with the
Diagnostic Interview Schedule21,22 according to Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria.23,24 Persistent
dependence was defined as the number of study waves out of
5 at which a study member met criteria for dependence: never
used cannabis at any study wave, used at least once between
ages 18 to 38 but never diagnosed, diagnosed at 1 wave, diag-
nosed at 2 waves, and diagnosed at 3 or more waves. For analy-
ses of health change from ages 26 to 38 years, we again de-
fined persistent dependence as the number of study waves at
which a study member met criteria for dependence but only
used cannabis data from ages 26 to 38 years.
Physical Health at Age 38 Years
Physical examinations were conducted during the assess-
ment day at age 38 years, with blood draws between 4:15 and
4:45 PM.25 eTable 2 in the Supplement describes each health
outcome: periodontal health, lung function, systemic inflam-
mation, metabolic syndrome, waist circumference, high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol level, triglyceride level, blood
pressure (systolic and diastolic), glycated hemoglobin level,
body mass index, and self-reported health. We report health
outcomes scored as continuously distributed outcomes be-

(a continuous variable), cannabis joint-years (a continuous variable), and

c Scores were standardized to a mean (SD) of 0.00 (1.00). Overall health at ages
3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 years was rated by 2 Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health
and Development Research Unit staff members based on review of birth
records and assessment dossiers, including clinical assessments and reports of
infections, diseases, injuries, hospitalizations, and other health problems
obtained during standardized maternal interviews. Ratings used a 5-point
scale (interrater agreement, 0.85). Socioeconomic status was defined as the
mean highest occupational status level of either parent across study
assessments (1 is unskilled laborer, and 6 is professional), from the study
member’
s birth through age 15 years, on New Zealand’
s occupational rating of
the 1970s.

causecontinuousmeasuresaremoresensitivetovariationthan
categorical measures. However, for clinical relevance, the
eTables in the Supplement also list results for health out-
comes scored as categorical clinical outcomes. Positively
skewed continuous outcomes (combined attachment loss, in-
flammation, triglyceride level, and glycated hemoglobin level)
were log-transformed before analysis.
Physical Health at Age 26 Years
The health measures at age 38 years were also administered
at age 26 years using the same procedures, with 2 exceptions.25
First, periodontal measurements were obtained using a half-
mouth design.26 Second, serum C-reactive protein level was
assayed with a sensitivity level of 1 mg/L.27 Due to this lower
sensitivity, C-reactive protein levels in the top quintile of the
distribution were designated as elevated.
Statistical Analysis
To test whether cannabis use was associated with poor health
in early midlife, we tested the bivariate association between
cannabis use from ages 18 to 38 years and health at age 38 years
(Table 2, model 1) and subsequently added tobacco pack-
years from ages 18 to 38 years as a covariate (Table 2, model
2). To test whether cannabis use from ages 26 to 38 years was
associated with health decline using the same measure of
health at both ages, we tested the bivariate association be-
tween cannabis use from ages 26 to 38 years and health at age
38 years (Table 3, model 1) and subsequently added health at
age 26 years as a covariate (Table 3, model 2), followed by to-
bacco pack-years from ages 26 to 38 years as an additional co-
variate (Table 3, model 3). All analyses controlled for sex.
Statistical analyses tested associations of tobacco pack-
years (a continuous variable), cannabis joint-years (a continu-
ous variable), and cannabis dependence (a 5-level ordinal vari-
able) with continuous and categorical health outcomes. We
analyzed continuous outcomes using ordinary least squares
regression to derive β coefficients and categorical outcomes
using Poisson regression models to derive relative risks (RRs).
We standardized continuous variables before conducting sta-
tistical tests. Therefore, β coefficients and RRs can be inter-
preted as the increase in risk of the outcome given a 1-SD in-
crease in pack-years or joint-years. To aid interpretation of β
coefficientsandRRsassociatedwithcontinuouspack-yearsand
joint-years, we report unstandardized, sex-adjusted means for
health outcomes as a function of tobacco and cannabis use,
withstudymembersgroupedaccordingtopack-yearsandjoint-
years in 5-year increments (Table 2).
Results
Tobacco Smoking and Health
Bivariate associations showed that tobacco pack-years was as-
sociated with worse health for 8 of the 12 health outcomes,
namely, periodontal health, lung function, systemic inflam-
mation, metabolic syndrome, high-density lipoprotein cho-
lesterollevel,triglyceridelevel,glycatedhemoglobinlevel,and
self-reported health (Table 2, model 1). Associations re-
mained significant for all 8 of these health outcomes after con-
trolling for cannabis joint-years (Table 2, model 2) and after ad-
ditionally controlling for childhood health and SES (eTable 3,
model 3 in the Supplement). Results were similar for clini-
cally relevant, categorically scored health outcomes (eTable
3 in the Supplement). For example, 12.3% of individuals who
never used tobacco daily had periodontal disease (≥1 site with
attachment loss >5 mm) compared with 52.9% of individuals
with 15 or more pack-years (eTable 3 in the Supplement). Sta-
tistical tests showed that for every SD increase in pack-years
(approximately 9 pack-years), the RR for periodontal disease
increased by 1.63 (P < .001) (eTable 3 in the Supplement). Find-
ings are consistent with prior research.26,28-36
Cannabis Use and Health
Bivariateassociationsshowedthatcannabisjoint-yearswasas-
sociatedwithworsehealthfor3of12healthoutcomes,namely,
periodontal health, lung function, and self-reported health
(Table 2, model 1). Adverse associations remained significant
for2outcomes(periodontalhealthandlungfunction)aftercon-
trolling for tobacco pack-years (Table 2, model 2) and after ad-
ditionally controlling for childhood health and SES (eTable 3,
model 3 in the Supplement). However, poorer lung function
(ratio of forced expiratory volume in the first second of expi-
ration [FEV1] to forced vital capacity [FVC]) (hereafter FEV1/
FVC) among cannabis users was probably not indicative of air-
way obstruction because joint-years (unlike tobacco pack-
years) was unrelated to reduced FEV1 (eTable 4 in the
Supplement). Rather, reduced FEV1/FVC among cannabis us-
ers was attributable to higher FVC values. It is unclear whether
higher FVC values reflect better health.
Unlike tobacco, cannabis joint-years was associated with
slightly smaller waist circumference and lower body mass in-
dex. Furthermore, after adjusting for tobacco pack-years
(Table 2, model 2), associations emerged between joint-years
and better high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride,
and glycated hemoglobin levels. However, joint-years was not
associatedwithlowerriskofmetabolicsyndrome.Resultswere
similar for categorically scored health outcomes (eTable 3 in
the Supplement).
Results for persistent cannabis dependence (as well as re-
sultsforpersistentregularcannabisuse[eTable5intheSupple-
ment]) were almost identical to those for joint-years. Bivari-
ate associations showed that persistent dependence was
associatedwithworsehealthfor3of12outcomes,namely,peri-
odontal health, lung function, and self-reported health. As-
sociations remained significant for 1 of those 3 (periodontal
health) after controlling for tobacco pack-years (Table 2, model
2) and after additionally controlling for childhood health and
SES (eTable 3, model 3 in the Supplement). Results were simi-
lar for categorically scored health outcomes (eTable 3 in the
Supplement). eTable 6 in the Supplement summarizes the
aforementioned findings.
Periodontal health was the only aspect of health that
showed a robust adverse association in analyses of both per-
sistent dependence and joint-years. Post hoc analyses showed
that cannabis users brushed and flossed less than others and
were more likely to be alcohol dependent (eTable 7 in the

Supplement).However,associationsbetweencannabisuseand
poor periodontal health remained significant after control-
ling for tobacco pack-years, childhood health and SES, brush-
ing and flossing, and alcohol dependence (eTable 8 in the
Supplement).
The general lack of association between persistent canna-
bis use and poor physical health may be surprising. One ex-
planation is that healthy youth select into cannabis use. Our
test showed no correlation between cannabis use and child-
hood health (Table 1). Another explanation is that cannabis us-
ers may have healthier adult lifestyles. Tests showed that can-
nabis use was not associated with more physical activity, with
adietoffruitsandvegetables,orwithlessalcoholabuse(eTable
7intheSupplement).Theabsenceofassociationsbetweencan-
nabis use and poor physical midlife health could not be attrib-
uted to better initial health, more physical activity, better diet,
or less alcohol abuse.
Tobacco and Cannabis Use and Change in Health
Tobacco pack-years from ages 26 to 38 years was associated
with worsening periodontal health, lung function, systemic in-
flammation, and metabolic health (Table 3, model 2). For ex-
ample, pack-years from ages 26 to 38 years was associated with
increased risk of metabolic syndrome at age 38 years after ac-
counting for metabolic syndrome at age 26 years (RR, 1.18;
P = .02) (Table 3, model 2). Tobacco users also self-reported
worse health at age 38 years, and this association persisted af-
ter accounting for self-reported health at age 26 years (Table 3,
model 2).
Like tobacco use, cannabis use was associated with
decline in periodontal health and lung function (Table 3,
model 2) even after accounting for tobacco pack-years from
ages 26 to 38 years (Table 3, model 3). Again, however,
decline in the FEV1/FVC was probably not attributable to air-
way obstruction because cannabis use was not robustly
associated with decline in FEV1 (eTable 9 in the Supple-
ment). Cannabis use was not associated with deteriorating
health in other domains. Results were similar for continu-
ously scored and categorically scored health outcomes
(eTable 10 in the Supplement).
Discussion
In general, our findings showed that cannabis use over 20
years was unrelated to health problems in early midlife.
Across several domains of health (periodontal health, lung
function, systemic inflammation, and metabolic health),
clear evidence of an adverse association with cannabis use
was apparent for only one domain, namely, periodontal
health. Cannabis use from ages 26 to 38 years was not asso-
ciated with within-individual health decline during this
12-year period with the exception of periodontal health. By
comparison, tobacco use was associated with worse peri-
odontal health, lung function, systemic inflammation, high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, triglyceride levels, and
glucose levels in early midlife, as well as health decline from
ages 26 to 38 years.

a For presentation of percentages and means, participants were grouped
according to pack-years and joint-years between ages 18-38 as follows: never
used tobacco daily/never used cannabis, used <5 years, used from 5 to <10
years, used from 10 to <15 years, and used for 15+ years. Participants were
grouped according to persistence of cannabis dependence as follows: never
used is never used cannabis, no diagnosis is used cannabis at least once
between ages 18-38 but never diagnosed, 1 diagnosis is diagnosed once
between ages 18-38, 2 diagnoses is diagnosed twice, three or more diagnoses
is diagnosed three or more times.
bStatistical analyses tested associations of cumulative tobacco pack-years (a
continuous variable), cumulative cannabis joint-years (a continuous variable),
and persistent cannabis dependence (a 5-level ordinal variable) with
continuous outcomes (except for metabolic syndrome, which is a categorical
outcome). Continuous variables were standardized for statistical tests.
Therefore, β coefficients can be interpreted as the increase in risk of the
outcome given a 1-SD increase in pack-years or joint-years. β Coefficients with
a positive sign indicate poorer health except where noted.
c Model 1 controls for sex. Model 2 adds controls for joint-years in analyses of
pack-years and adds controls for pack-years in analyses of joint-years and
cannabis dependence. Analyses of lung function additionally control for
height.
dβ Coefficients with a negative sign indicate poorer health.
e Estimates are relative risks. For analyses of tobacco pack-years, numbers.
range from 892 to 945 for model 1 and 886 to 938 for model 2. For analyses of
cannabis joint-years and cannabis dependence, numbers. range from 888 to
940 for model 1 and 886 to 938 for model 2. The reason for different
numbers. across analyses is that there was some variation in missingness for
specific health measurements. Among the 947 study members included in this
study, 47 refused the dental examination, 28 did not complete the lung
function assessment, 35 refused phlebotomy, 9 were pregnant, 6 glycated
hemoglobin samples were lost in the laboratory due to the 2011 Christchurch,
New Zealand, earthquake, and there were a handful of miscellaneous assay
failures.

Findings showed that cannabis use was associated with
slightly better metabolic health (smaller waist circumfer-
ence, lower body mass index, better lipid profiles, and im-
proved glucose control). However, most of these associations
emerged only after controlling for tobacco use. Effects were
small but intriguing given similar reports from cross-
sectional studies,4,8,9,37-39 as well as evidence that endocan-
nabinoids appear to be involved in the regulation of
metabolism.40 Studies41,42 have shown that overweight pa-
tients who took rimonabant (a synthetic cannabinoid-1 recep-
tor blocker) demonstrated reduced waist circumference and
improved lipid profiles. However, it is unclear if and how rec-
reational cannabis use (and plant-based cannabinoids) might
affect metabolic health. Cannabinoid pharmacology is more
complex than commonly believed,43 and biological argu-
ments can be made for cannabis-related worsening or im-
provement of metabolic health.9,44 The only other longitudi-
nal study45 to characterize cannabis users’metabolic health
found no association, and our finding of a small association
mainly emerged after controlling for tobacco use. Moreover,
cannabis use was not associated with reduced risk of meta-
bolic syndrome. Therefore, current evidence suggests that rec-
reational cannabis use is unlikely to improve metabolic health
in the general population.
In at least 2 instances, we found no association between
cannabis use and poor health when we might have expected
one. In the first instance, we found no association between
cannabis use and reduced FEV1 (eTable 4 in the Supple-
ment), which is somewhat puzzling given that tobacco use is
associated with reduced FEV1.
28,29 An association between
cannabis use and reduced FEV1 could emerge with greater
exposure to cannabis.28 Nonetheless, given no evidence of
reduced FEV1 among cannabis users, our finding of lower
FEV1/FVC among cannabis users probably did not indicate
airway obstruction. Rather, reduced FEV1/FVC appeared to
reflect cannabis users’slightly larger FVC. This association

with larger FVC, also reported elsewhere,28 is not under-
stood. Overall, findings are consistent with a 2011 review
concluding that there is little evidence that cannabis affects
FEV1 and airway obstruction.46 In the second surprising
instance, we found no association between cannabis use and
cardiovascular risks (eg, high blood pressure and worse cho-
lesterol levels), which may appear at odds with evidence
that cannabis use increases risk for cardiovascular
complications,47-49 even among young healthy individuals.50
Our somewhat disparate findings are reconciled by evidence
that cannabis-related cardiovascular complications are likely
acute cannabis effects.38,45,47,49
Although we found that cannabis users were generally no
worse off than nonusers on almost all health indexes, they did
have worse periodontal health. Cannabis use was associated
withattachmentloss,whichcanresultintoothloss.26,36Asimi-
lar association was observed for tobacco use, consistent with
previous research.26,36,51 Tobacco’
s effect on periodontal dis-
ease is thought to be mediated through increased inflamma-
tion and vasoconstriction,51 which may or may not be the case
for cannabis. Cannabis use was not associated with systemic
inflammation here or elsewhere,30,39 but prior research has
shown that cannabis use can induce vasoconstriction.52,53
This study has limitations. First, cannabis joint-years
was based on self-reports obtained at ages 18 to 38 years.
Validation of cannabis use through laboratory measures
could have helped detect cannabis users who denied use.
However, underreporting due to reluctance to admit to ille-
gal drug use is unlikely because study members, interviewed
repeatedly over the course of their lives, have learned to
trust our confidentiality guarantee. Second, disentangling
cannabis use and tobacco use is challenging. In New Zea-
land, cannabis is not typically mixed with tobacco,10 but
most participants who used cannabis also smoked ciga-
rettes. Although we controlled for tobacco use, imperfect
control might bias results toward finding spurious associa-
tions between cannabis use and poor health. However, we
note that all poor health outcomes, apart from periodontal
disease, were unrelated to cannabis use. Third, our findings
are based on a single New Zealand cohort who began using
cannabis in the 1980s to 1990s. Although our findings are
generally consistent with longitudinal studies2,54 of US
samples (eTable 1 in the Supplement), tetrahydrocannabinol
(the primary psychoactive ingredient in cannabis) content
has increased since then.54 If health associations are medi-
ated by tetrahydrocannabinol, we may have underestimated
the association between cannabis use and health. Fourth,
our conclusions are limited to a specific set of health prob-
lems assessed in early midlife. Although this investigation is
the most comprehensive study to date, cannabis use may be
associated with health problems not studied here or with
those that tend to emerge later in life, such as cancer. Fifth,
we compared findings for cannabis against findings for
tobacco. Our intent in doing so was to allay concerns that our
study’
s methods might be unable to detect health problems.
We acknowledge that participants acquired more tobacco
pack-years than cannabis joint-years, with most cannabis
users using daily for fewer than 5 years. Greater tobacco
exposure may explain health decline associated with
tobacco use but not cannabis use. If patterns of cannabis use
shift and more users begin to use cannabis as they do
tobacco (ie, multiple joints per day), cannabis-associated
health problems might emerge. Sixth, our study cannot
comment on the health effects of cannabis use in older
adults or the safety of medical marijuana use in patients who
are already unwell.
Conclusions
This study has a number of implications. First, cannabis use
for up to 20 years is not associated with a specific set of
physical health problems in early midlife. The sole exception
is that cannabis use is associated with periodontal disease.
Second, cannabis use for up to 20 years is not associated
with net metabolic benefits (ie, lower rates of metabolic syn-
drome). Third, our results should be interpreted in the con-
text of prior research showing that cannabis use is associ-
ated with accidents and injuries, bronchitis, acute
cardiovascular events, and, possibly, infectious diseases and
cancer, as well as poor psychosocial and mental health
outcomes.1-3,19,20,46,55-58
