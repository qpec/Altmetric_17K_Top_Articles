Abstract
To forecast future trends in diabetes prevalence, morbidity, and costs in the United States, the Institute
for Alternative Futures has updated its diabetes forecasting model and extended its projections to 2030
for the nation, all states, and several metropolitan areas. This paper describes the methodology and data
sources for these diabetes forecasts and discusses key implications. In short, diabetes will remain a major
health crisis in America, in spite of medical advances and prevention efforts. The prevalence of diabetes
(type 2 diabetes and type 1 diabetes) will increase by 54% to more than 54.9 million Americans between
2015 and 2030; annual deaths attributed to diabetes will climb by 38% to 385,800; and total annual
medical and societal costs related to diabetes will increase 53% to more than $622 billion by 2030.
Improvements in management reducing the annual incidence of morbidities and premature deaths related
to diabetes over this time period will result in diabetes patients living longer, but requiring many years of
comprehensive management of multiple chronic diseases, resulting in dramatically increased costs. Ag-
gressive population health measures, including increased availability of diabetes prevention programs,
could help millions of adults prevent or delay the progression to type 2 diabetes, thereby helping turn
around these dire projections.
Introduction
D
iabetes and its complications, deaths, and societal
costs have a huge and rapidly growing impact on the
United States. Between 1990 and 2010 the number of people
living with diabetes tripled and the number of new cases
annually (incidence) doubled.1 Adults with diabetes have a
50% higher risk of death from any cause than adults without
diabetes, in addition to risk for myriad complications.2 Re-
ducing this burden will require efforts on many fronts—from
appropriate medical care to significant public health efforts
and individual behavior change across the nation, through
state- and community-specific efforts. Public awareness is a
key first step. For this purpose, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) releases national diabetes
statistics every 2 years, providing a point-in-time picture of
diabetes for the country as a whole. However, state and
metropolitan diabetes forecasts with projections several years
into the future also are useful as health professionals and
decision makers contemplate actions to address the diabetes
epidemic. Therefore, the Institute for Alternative Futures
(IAF) has prepared 2015, 2020, 2025, and 2030 diabetes
forecasts for the entire United States, every state, and several
metropolitan statistical areas, all of which are easily acces-
sible on the Internet.3
This study shows how past trends, current data, and future
projections provide valuable insights about the possible
course of diabetes.

 diabetes data trends.4 Estimates of diagnosed diabetes
prevalence to 2030 are derived from Boyle et al’s sophis-
ticated dynamic modeling paper, which projected the dia-
betes burden to 2050.5 The present study utilized Boyle
et al’s conservative 3-state dynamic model, middle-ground
scenario of low, steady diabetes incidence
(8.4 cases per
1000 adult population) and low diabetes mortality. How-
ever, 2 recent studies suggest that the diagnosed diabetes
incidence trend has begun to level off and could be de-
clining.6,7 It is difficult to know if this trend will continue,
and hard to forecast to what extent long-term prevalence
might be reduced because so many other factors, such as an
aging population and falling diabetes morbidity and mor-
tality, enter into the equation. Because the incidence used in
Boyle et al’s model is higher than present experience, the
research team reduced its prevalence growth to 2030 by a
modest 2% to prevent overestimating the magnitude of di-
agnosed diabetes.
The team made 2 other significant changes. Their 2025
Model utilized Boyle et al’s projection that undiagnosed
diabetes would be 33% of total diabetes in 2015, declining
to 25% in 2030. Based on the trend of CDC national dia-
betes statistics (29.8% of total diabetes being undiagnosed
in 2005, 24.2% in 2007, 27.1% in 2010, and 27.8% in
2012),2,8,9,10 the IAF model projects 27% will be undiag-
nosed in 2015, declining to 24% in 2030. Second, the
prevalence of prediabetes has been progressively climbing
in CDC national statistics (20% of the adult population in
2000, 26% in 2007, 35% in 2010, and 37% in 2012), so the
IAF model used 38% of the population ages 20 years and
older having prediabetes in 2015, slowly increasing to 40%
in 2030.
Each state and metropolitan area has its unique preva-
lence rates. Based on the latest CDC data, Dall et al cal-
culated the prevalence of diagnosed, undiagnosed, and
prediabetes for every state for 2012.11 Utilizing the ratio of
each state to US prevalence rates and assuming this rate
remains constant between 2015 and 2030 (there are no data
available to estimate a state’s future variation), state diag-
nosed, undiagnosed, and prediabetes forecasts were created.
Metropolitan area forecasts utilized their state prevalence
rates.
Population data
The national census data (including race and Hispanic
origin) population projections to 2030 came from 2010 US
Census Bureau data.12 Unfortunately, state projections have
not been updated with the 2010 census so 2000 census data
were used.13 Census data of state minority projections to
2025 were last calculated from the 1990 census, and most
states do not have their own projections to 2030. The re-
search team therefore considered state minority forecasts too
imprecise to include them in the IAF Diabetes 2030 Model.
Metropolitan statistical area population projections to 2030
came from Demographia14 and Bizjournals.15
Diabetes morbidity and mortality
The CDC National Center for Health Statistics tracks
visual impairment,16 end-stage renal failure,17 and lower
extremity amputation18 annual trends related to diabetes.
Analysis of the latest available 10-year data revealed a 19%
decline in the prevalence of reported visual impairment in
those with diagnosed diabetes, a 26% decline in the annual
incidence of new end-stage renal failure, and a 65% decline
in the incidence of nontraumatic lower extremity amputa-
tions. An additional 30% decline over the 20-year period
from 2010 to 2030 for each morbidity was factored in as a
plausible estimate to account for anticipated increasing ac-
cess and more aggressive medical management. Each mi-
nority group had different morbidity trends, which were
similarly calculated and applied for total US minority pro-
jections.
To calculate the percent risk of death from diabetes, the
research team used annual death data published for the most
recent 10 years (2000 to 2010) from the National Vital
Statistic Reports.19 A death from diabetes is defined as a
death for which the underlying cause listed on the death
certificate is diabetes. Plotting this trend line of annual
percent incidence of death per individual with diagnosed
diabetes revealed a 40% decline. The model assumes a
modest additional 25% decline over the period between
2010 and 2030 to calculate deaths caused by diagnosed di-
abetes. Recent CDC diabetes fact sheets also include deaths
for which diabetes was a contributing cause of death on the
certificate. For instance, the latest data from 2010 state
69,071 death certificates listed diabetes as the cause and
234,051 death certificates listed diabetes as a contributing
cause of death (almost 3.4 times higher).2 Therefore, the
projected declining percentage of those with diagnosed di-
abetes dying per year directly because of diabetes times this
ratio provides the total number of annual deaths to which
diabetes contributed. Specific death rate trends for minori-
ties and seniors ages 65 and older also are derived from the
National Vital Statistics Reports data.
The cost of diabetes
The 2014 paper by Dall et al calculated the direct medical
costs and indirect economic burden of diagnosed diabetes,
undiagnosed diabetes, and prediabetes for the United States
and all states in 2012.11 The research team adjusted these
costs on a per person basis to 2015 dollars, and used them
when projecting costs out to 2030 for the United States, all
states, and selected metropolitan statistical areas.
Results
Between 2015 and 2030, the IAF Diabetes Model projects
that the total number of people with type 2 and type 1 di-
abetes will increase by 19,629,000 to 54,913,000 people, a
54% increase. The cost of diabetes in 2015 dollars will in-
crease to $622.3 billion, a 53% increase. Table 1 presents
the data for the United States between 2015 and 2030 for the
population as a whole and the 2 largest minority groups—
Hispanic Americans and African Americans. National data
for Asian Americans, Native Americans, and seniors ages
65 and older are available online, along with data for all 50
states and several metropolitan statistical areas.3
Figure 1 shows 4 maps with the age-adjusted prevalence
of total diabetes as a percent of the total population for every
state in the United States between 2015 and 2030. It is clear
that there is a wide disparity in prevalence rates among
states. The increase in diabetes prevalence between 2015
and 2030 was less than 3% for Alaska, Colorado, and Utah,
DIABETES 2030 INSIGHTS
7
 whereas it was more than 5% in Alabama, Florida, Mis-
sissippi, and West Virginia. In 2030 this model predicts that
diabetes will impact 10.2% of the total population of Utah,
more than 18% in Alabama, Florida, and Mississippi, and
20.5% in West Virginia.
Comparing the results from the new Diabetes 2030 Model
to IAF’s prior Diabetes 2025 Model reveals that there will
be 1,966,700, or 4.5%, fewer people with diagnosed dia-
betes in 2030. Ninety-five percent of the decline is caused
by the Census Bureau reducing its 2030 population projec-
tion by 15 million in the 2010 census report compared to its
2000 forecast.12,20 The remainder of the decline is related to
an adjustment for the recent leveling of the incidence trend.
Additionally, in the new model there will be 1,519,800, or
10.3%, fewer people with undiagnosed diabetes because of
lower undiagnosed diabetes prevalence rates. Therefore,
total diabetes is projected to be 3,426,500, or 5.8%, lower
using the Diabetes 2030 Model. However, prevalence of
prediabetes is higher in this model, resulting in 12,581,900
more individuals with prediabetes (a 13.2% increase) in
2030.
Discussion
The process of exploring past and present data trends to
ponder their implications for the future leads to several in-
sights about the future course of diabetes if America remains
on its present course.
The incidence of diabetes may be leveling off. Geiss
showed that although diabetes incidence more than doubled
from 3.2 cases per 1000 adults in 1990 to 8.8 cases per 1000
in 2008, the incidence held steady statistically in 2012 at 7.1
cases per 1000.6 In addition, a 2014 study looking at Fra-
mingham Heart Study data found the incidence of diabetes

ROWLEY ET AL
 remained steady in the 2000s in spite of rising obesity.7
However, the just released National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey found almost 38% of American adults
were obese in 2013–2014 up from almost 35% in 2011–2012,
suggesting that obesity has not yet leveled off.21 Increasing
obesity may lead to increasing diabetes.22 Therefore, it is too
early to know whether the promising diabetes incidence trend
toward equilibrium will continue. The IAF Diabetes 2030
Model has a steady incidence rate to prevent overestimating
prevalence growth.
The annual incidence of new complications related to
diabetes is declining. The present study found a 26% decline
in annual incidence of new end-stage renal disease related to
diabetes between 1998 and 2008, a 65% decline in incidence
of nontraumatic lower extremity amputation in the popula-
tion with diabetes between 1999 and 2009, and a 19% de-
cline in prevalence of reported visual impairment in those
with diagnosed diabetes between 2000 and 2010. Supple-
menting the data from the present study, Gregg et al showed
a 68% decline in the incidence of myocardial infarctions and
a 53% decline in strokes in those with diabetes, in addition
to a 64% decline in deaths related to hyperglycemic crisis
between 1990 and 2010.1
The annual incidence of deaths related to diabetes is de-
clining. The present study found a 40% decline in the in-
cidence of deaths directly caused by diabetes on the death
certificate between 2000 and 2010, and the model projects a
further 25% decline between 2010 and 2030. Gregg et al
found that among adults with diabetes, the cardiovascular
death rate declined by 40% between 1990 and 2006 and that
all-cause mortality declined by 23%.23 The declines among
those with diabetes exceeded the declines among those
without diabetes, resulting in a more than 50% reduction of
the excess death rates attributed to diabetes. Another 2014
article by Gregg et al calculated that the number of life years
lost to diabetes diagnosed at age 40 declined from 7.7 years
in 1990–1999 to 5.8 years in 2000–2011 for men and from
8.7 to 6.8 years for women.24
Management of diabetes patients is progressively im-
proving. Multiple studies have shown that complications can
be reduced significantly with intensive control of glucose,
blood pressure (BP), and lipid levels in type 2 diabe-
tes.25,26,27,28 Medical care for people with diabetes is im-
proving. Between 1999 and 2010, the US health care system
achieved modest improvement in 5 out of 6 recommended
goals for diabetes care: glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c)
<7.0% (7.9% improvement), BP <130/80 mmHg (11.7%
improvement), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol
<100 mg/dl (20.8% improvement), and an annual foot exam
(6.8% improvement). Unfortunately, no improvement was
seen in annual eye exams, and nearly half of all patients
failed to meet at least 1 recommended goal for diabetes care.
Additionally only 14.3% met the target for all 3 tested
measures (A1c, BP, and LDL cholesterol) plus were not
smoking.29 Several studies have shown poor adherence to
medication regimens among patients with type 1 and type 2
diabetes.30 A 2014 study by Li et al found that during 2011–
2012 only 6.8% of privately insured, newly diagnosed adults
participated in Diabetes Self-Management Education and
Training within the first year after diagnosis, even though it
is covered by a majority of insurance plans and is strongly
recommended.31 Because participation requires a physician
referral, this highlights a huge gap between a recommended
guideline and current practice.
Prevalence of total diabetes, associated major complica-
tions, and deaths are all increasing. In spite of the apparent
stabilizing incidence of diabetes, the prevalence of total
diabetes is projected to grow 54% from 35,644,000 to
54,913,000 between 2015 and 2030. Also during this time
period, the annual number of people with diabetes with new

 end-stage renal disease will increase by 27,370, and the
number of new amputations will increase by 13,330. The
annual number of deaths to which diabetes contributed will
rise by 106,630. A growing population is a factor, but all
these numbers are growing faster than the population.
Several other factors seem to be responsible6: (1) An aging
population that, overall, is living longer will result in more
people with diabetes as incidence increases dramatically in
later life. (2) The significant decline in the incidence of
deaths caused by diabetes means those with diabetes will be
living longer, many with significant chronic comorbidities.
(3) The increasing population of African Americans and
Hispanic Americans, who are at higher risk of diabetes, also
adds to increased prevalence of the disease. (4) Finally, the
dramatic increase in type 2 diabetes in children and ado-
lescents, rising from 3% of new cases of diabetes in children
pre-1990s to 45% of new cases in 2005, means more young
and middle-aged adults will be living with diabetes.32
The cost of diabetes is increasing dramatically. Between
2015 and 2030 the total costs in the United States are ex-
pected to increase from $408 billion to $622 billion, a 53%
increase (Table 1). The cost of diagnosed diabetes increased
by 41% between 2007 and 2012, but individual costs of
diabetes care increased only 19% whereas national health
care expenditures increased 24%. Therefore, increased
prevalence, not increased cost per patient, is causing the
increased economic burden of diabetes.33 Also, between
2007 and 2012 the cost of prediabetes increased 74% to $44
billion, so the increasing prevalence of diabetes and predi-
abetes is the driving force behind the dramatically increas-
ing economic burden of diabetes.11
Between 1987 and 2011 prescription medications ac-
counted for 55% of the per capita increase in medical
spending for diabetes.34 Prescription drug prices rose 10.9%
in 2014 and again more than 10% in 2015.35 In 2014, for the
fourth year in a row, per person spending on diabetes drugs
was higher than any other class of traditional drug, and
fewer than half of diabetes prescriptions were for generic
drugs.36 Because new advanced diabetes drugs tend to be
much more expensive than those replaced, it is quite pos-
sible that the medical costs of diabetes in 2030 will be
significantly higher than the present study’s projections.
Major initiatives are needed to turn around the growing
diabetes epidemic
Diagnosed
diabetes.
The knowledge
and treatment
modalities for successfully managing diabetes are well es-
tablished, but success requires a collaborative team working
diligently with the patient and family to achieve optimal
health. There is much room for improvement in health care
delivery to obtain continuous access to care, consistently
attend to all risk factors and comorbidities, and to help pa-
tients succeed in compliance with medications and healthy
living.
Undiagnosed diabetes.
One in 4 Americans with dia-
betes do not know that they have it, but it can lead to life-
threatening complications.2 Current screening criteria fail to
detect more than 50% of undiagnosed diabetes.33 The recent
final diabetes screening guideline from the US Preventive
Services Task Force, published October 27, 2015, expands
the population of adults recommended for screening from
only those with hypertension (2008 guideline) to all adults
ages 40 to 70 years who are overweight or obese.37 Wide
dissemination and implementation of these screening crite-
ria, even though they are more restrictive than American
Diabetes Association guidelines, should help identify a
much greater percentage of those adults with undiagnosed
diabetes and prediabetes.
Prediabetes.
The
research
team
forecasts
that
the
number of Americans with prediabetes will climb from 90.6
million in 2015 to 107.7 million in 2030. This increased
prevalence means 30% of all Americans and 51% of all
seniors would have prediabetes. Currently only about 10%
of those adults with prediabetes are aware of their condition,
and without effective intervention, up to a third of them will
go on to develop diabetes within 5 years.38 Programs such as
the Diabetes Prevention Program clinical trial have shown
that intensive lifestyle interventions can reduce the risk of
going on to develop type 2 diabetes by 58% in overweight or
obese adults with prediabetes.35
The best solution for turning around the diabetes epi-
demic is preventing prediabetes and its progression to dia-
betes in the first place. Achieving such an outcome calls for
addressing underlying societal risk factors that can con-
tribute
to
unhealthy
lifestyles,
and
would
require
a
‘‘population-wide’’ approach that addresses health promo-
tion, obesity prevention, and creates a physical, cultural, and
psychological environment that supports healthy living
naturally. This outcome could not be achieved by individual
health providers and patients alone, but requires integrated
systems of care incentivized for desired health outcomes. It
also would require a political will for effective policies and
commitment of the public at all levels. These strategies are
mutually reinforcing and may have a greater impact if ad-
dressed at the state and local levels.
Limitations
There were several limitations in this analysis. Forecast-
ing 15 years into the future carries the caveat: if current
trends do not change. Technological advances follow a
general pattern, but sometimes there can be profound and
unexpected shifts. People tend to be largely resistant to
change, especially health behavior change. Unexpected
cultural shifts and other factors prompting change are pos-
sible. The research team has been consistent in using CDC
statistics, the basic Boyle et al (CDC) 2050 projection model
and the Dall et al cost model. In some cases, ideal data are
not available, especially regarding minorities. In addition,
excellent research from different studies at times reaches
quite different conclusions. The research team has been
explicit about the assumptions they have made, and have
been conservative in their forecasts of future trends.
Conclusions
To support efforts at public awareness, and the work of
health professionals and policy makers at many levels, the
research team has updated projections out to 2030 for the
United States, all 50 states, and many metropolitan areas,
and made them freely available online. The team finds that
in spite of medical advances and prevention efforts, diabetes
10
ROWLEY ET AL
 presents a major health crisis in terms of prevalence, mor-
bidity, and costs, and that this crisis will worsen signifi-
cantly over the next 15 years. It is important to enhance
screening, education, and support efforts at the local, state,
and federal levels to appropriately screen for diabetes and
prediabetes. Also, in addition to effective management for
all those with diabetes, success will require aggressive ef-
forts to identify adults with prediabetes and to intervene to
help them prevent or delay the progression to type 2 dia-
betes in the first place. Another daunting challenge in pre-
venting diabetes and prediabetes is changing cultural norms
and societal behavior and structures in order to support
healthy living. Aggressive efforts are urgently needed if we
want to significantly reduce the diabetes epidemic by 2030.
