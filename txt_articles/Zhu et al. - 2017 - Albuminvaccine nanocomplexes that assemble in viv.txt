Subunit vaccines have been investigated in over 1000 clinical trials of cancer immunotherapy,
but have shown limited efficacy. Nanovaccines may improve efficacy but have rarely been
clinically translated. By conjugating molecular vaccines with Evans blue (EB) into albumin-
binding vaccines (AlbiVax), here we develop clinically promising albumin/AlbiVax nano-
complexes that self-assemble in vivo from AlbiVax and endogenous albumin for efficient
vaccine delivery and potent cancer immunotherapy. PET pharmacoimaging, super-resolution
microscopies, and flow cytometry reveal almost 100-fold more efficient co-delivery of CpG
and antigens (Ags) to lymph nodes (LNs) by albumin/AlbiVax than benchmark incomplete
Freund’s adjuvant (IFA). Albumin/AlbiVax elicits ~10 times more frequent peripheral antigen-
specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes with immune memory than IFA-emulsifying vaccines.
Albumin/AlbiVax specifically inhibits progression of established primary or metastatic EG7.
OVA, B16F10, and MC38 tumors; combination with anti-PD-1 and/or Abraxane further
potentiates immunotherapy and eradicates most MC38 tumors. Albumin/AlbiVax nano-
complexes are thus a robust platform for combination cancer immunotherapy.

he past decade has witnessed remarkable advances in
cancer immunotherapy, including immune checkpoint
inhibitors1. However, only limited patient populations
respond to single immune checkpoint inhibitors, and although
combining multiple biologic checkpoint inhibitors increases
response rates, it also elevates toxicity. Vaccines exploit syner-
gistic signaling pathways for combination cancer immunother-
apy. Despite the tremendous potential of subunit vaccines for
cancer immunotherapy, their clinical outcome thus far has been
suboptimal, largely due to inefficient co-delivery of adjuvants and
Ags to secondary lymphoid organs, such as LNs where immune
responses of lymphocytes are coordinated, leading to weak
immunostimulation and immune tolerance2,3. Although tumor-
specific neoantigens are promising for personalized immu-
notherapy4–9, there remains a lack of a general technology to
deliver heterogenous peptide neoantigens efficiently. As a clinical
benchmark, subunit Ags are administered in depot-forming
water-in-oil emulsions (e.g., IFA) of CpG oligodeoxynucleotide, a
Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist, and T helper 1 enhancer10,11.
Despite sustainable vaccine release from the depot and improved
Ag immunogenicity, IFA has limited clinical efficacy. Indeed, IFA
sequesters minimal Ag determinant-specific T cells in the depots,

AlbiCpG and albumin-binding Ag (AlbiAg). AlbiCpG were engineered by site specifically conjugating MEB and thiol-modified CpG, with hexaethyloxy-
glycol (HEG) as tunable linkers; AlbiAg was synthesized by conjugating MEB and cysteine-modified Ags, including TAA and tumor-specific neoantigen
discovered via exome sequencing. Left lower: locally administered AlbiVax binds to endogenous albumin and assembles into albumin/AlbiVax
nanocomplexes, which were efficiently delivered to LNs due to lymphatic drainage and prolonged retention in LNs. Right: harnessing the endocytosis
pathway of albumin, albumin/AlbiCpG and albumin/AlbiAg nanocomplexes were co-delivered into APCs and activated APCs for antigen cross
presentation and clonal expansion of antigen-specific CD8+ CTLs, thereby eliciting robust and durable antitumor immunity. While albumin/AlbiVax
nanocomplexes upregulated the expression of PD-1 on these CD8+ CTLs, combination of albumin/AlbiVax nanocomplexes with anti-PD-1 dramatically
enhanced immunotherapeutic efficacy in established primary and metastatic tumors. The pharmacological behaviors of albumin/AlbiVax nanocomplexes
were studied by quantitative PET imaging, light sheet fluorescence microscopy in whole cleared tissue, and super-resolution imaging in single APCs

 exhausting and depleting T cells, thereby preventing T cells from
infiltrating tumors12. Alternatively, nanovaccines, which can
efficiently co-deliver locally administered adjuvants/Ags into LNs
via lymphatics, have been explored for vaccine delivery13–16.
However, the pharmacological behaviors of perhaps all currently
reported nanovaccines were studied either invasively or semi-
quantitatively, and more importantly, the clinical translation of

bypass the complications mentioned above. Compared with

 including quality control and safety evaluation. Many natural
biomolecules, such as albumin and immunoglobins (IgGs), are
excellent candidates for endogenous carriers, given their (1) long
half-lives (over 20 days in humans)19, (2) ubiquity in peripheral
tissues, and (3) easy accessibility to vaccines with good patient
compliance20. Internalized IgG and albumin in cells can be
recycled from endolysosomes and transported out of cells via
acidic binding to receptors, including fragment crystallizable
receptor (FcR) and neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), thereby avoiding
protein degradation and prolonging their half-lives. We chose
albumin as an endogenous component to assemble nanovaccines
with exogenous molecular vaccines, for the following reasons: (1)
While binding to endogenous IgG Fc likely interferes with IgG’s
biological functions, albumin is a natural carrier with multiple,
versatile, intrinsic-binding sites for biomolecules, and drugs21–25;
(2) The size of murine and human albumins (66 kDa) exceeds the
cutoff (45 kDa) to be disseminated systemically from interstitial
space by blood26, meaning that nearly all will be drained through
lymphatics to LNs. Together with the slow lymph flow, these
characteristics offer a long time window for albumin/AlbiVax
nanocomplexes to modulate lymphocytes in LNs. Interestingly,
albumin can be efficiently internalized by antigen-presenting cells
(APCs) via endocytosis, which can facilitate intracellular vaccine
delivery for optimal Ag processing and presentation. Indeed,
albumin–drug conjugates/complexes have been enthusiastically
pursued for decades27, ranging from albumin conjugates of
antiviral 5-fluorodeoxyuridine and cytosine arabinoside22,25,28,
lipid-prodrug conjugates29, drug-peptide/fatty acid conjugates30,
to Abraxane of albumin/paclitaxel nanocomplexes. Specific
albumin–vaccine conjugates include streptococcal protein G-

that
remarkably improved vaccine delivery to LNs and substantially
potentiated immune responses.
Here we took a clinically oriented perspective to develop
AlbiVax by first repurposing a clinically practiced EB that binds
to albumin at binding site I33, and then conjugating molecular
vaccines with an EB derivative. The resulting albumin/AlbiVax
nanocomplexes that assemble in vivo were efficiently delivered to
LNs and induced potent and durable anti-cancer immunity. EB
and derivatives have been developed for preclinical and clinical
LN identification34–39. They have excellent clinical safety pro-
files36,39, and rhesus monkeys survived 25 mg kg−1 systemically
injected EB40, a dose 500-fold higher than that of AlbiVax. We
exploited multiscale pharmacoimaging to quantitatively and
systematically investigate the pharmacology of albumin/AlbiVax
nanocomplexes in animals by PET, in entire LNs by light sheet
fluorescence microscopy, and in APCs by super-resolution
instantaneous structured illumination microscopy (instant SIM)
41. Albumin/AlbiVax nanocomplexes potentiated both innate and
adaptive immunity, leading to a markedly expanded repertoire of
Ag-specific CD8+ CTLs and T cell memory. Albumin/AlbiVax
nanocomplexes, alone or in combination with anti-PD-1 and/or
Abraxane, dramatically inhibited tumor progression in multiple
syngeneic tumor models.
Results
Efficient LN delivery of albumin/AlbiVax nanocomplexes.
AlbiVax was synthesized by conjugating thiol-modified vaccines
with maleimide-functionalized EB derivative (MEB), which
tightly binds to human serum albumin (HSA) on binding site I
(Fig. 1 and Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). CpG was studied first.
MEB was conjugated onto the 3′-end of CpG (Supplementary
Fig. 3), and the resulting MEB–CpG, as a candidate of albumin-
binding CpG (AlbiCpG), either alone or premixed with albumin,
maintained the immunostimulatory activity of CpG in RAW264.7
macrophages. By contrast, MEB modification on the 5′-end of
CpG abrogated its activity42. MEB-GpC control was also not
immunostimulatory (Supplementary Fig. 4). Like MEB43, in the
presence of albumin, the originally self-quenched MEB fluores-
cence of MEB–CpG was recovered and the fluorescence lifetime
was prolonged, indicating albumin binding of MEB–CpG. The
fluorescence of MEB–CpG was less than MEB upon albumin
binding (Supplementary Fig. 5a, b). Intriguingly, the fluorescence
of MEB–DNAs was partially activated in the absence of albumin,
in a manner independent of DNA sequence, length, and deox-
ynucleotides, presumably resulting from intramolecular electro-
static interactions between MEB and ssDNA in MEB–DNAs, as
well as reduced intermolecular stacking of MEB–DNAs relative to
free MEB (Supplementary Figs. 6–9).
The above fluorescence phenomena imply interactions between
MEB and DNA in MEB–CpG, which likely interfere with the
albumin binding of MEB–CpG. Thus, 0, 1, 2, and 3 units of HEG
linkers between MEB and CpG were used to synthesize
MEB–CpG
(MC),
MEB–HEG–CpG
(MH1C),
MEB–
(HEG)2–CpG (MH2C), and MEB–(HEG)3–CpG (MH3C) with
ca. 0, 2, 4, and 6-nm linkers, respectively, and quantitatively
screened for LN delivery by PET in FVB mice. Specifically,
MEB–CpG derivatives were radiolabeled with 64Cu (t1/2: 12.6 h)
via
1,4,7-triazacyclononane-triacetic
acid
(NOTA)-MEB
(NMEB)44 (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 10), and were
subcutaneously (s.c.) injected (dose: 4.4–5.5 Mbq) at the tail base
of mice, followed by PET imaging over 3 days (Fig. 2b,
Supplementary Figs. 11 and 12, and Supplementary Movie 1).
PEG–CpG conjugate (PEG MW: 20 kDa), and CpG with or
without IFA were used as controls. As quantified from decay-
corrected PET results (Fig. 2c), only <0.3% injection dose (%ID)
of CpG was delivered to inguinal (IN) and axillary (AX) LNs, and
IFA-emulsified CpG [IFA(CpG)] was substantially trapped at the
injection sites with little delivered to draining LNs. In contrast, all
MEB–CpG derivatives were efficiently delivered to LNs (IN +
AX), with MH2C and MH3C being the most efficient (%ID: 0.62
MC, 1.08 MH1C, 1.49 MH2C, and 1.52 MH3C at 6 h post
injection). MH2C peaked with 2.60 ± 0.30 %ID at 48 h post
injection, with more than 1.45 %ID retained in LNs over 3 days.
The area under the curve (AUC) of MC, MH1C, MH2C, and
MH3C in these LNs were 3.0-, 5.5-, 6.5-, and 6.1-fold greater,
respectively, than that of CpG within 3 days. The deep
penetration of PET allowed to observe substantial amounts of
MEB–CpG derivatives also in deep iliac (IL) LNs (Supplementary
Fig. 13). PEG–CpG failed to enhance LN delivery, which suggests
the essential and unique role of albumin for efficient LN delivery
of albumin/AlbiVax nanocomplexes and rules out that the large
size of albumin/AlbiCpG nanocomplexes was the sole factor
contributing to efficient LN delivery. Significant amount of CpG
and derivatives were still retained at injection sites (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 14), likely due to the slow lymphatic clearance and the
interaction of phosphorothioate DNA with extracellular matrix.
Consistently, high signal intensity and density of MEB–CpG
derivatives in resected draining LNs were detected by γ counting.
On day 3, IN LNs had 38.8 ± 6.3, 48.9 ± 6.2, 67.4 ± 9.3, and 59.5
± 6.02 (mean ± standard error of mean (s.e.m.), same below; n =
4) percent injection dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g) of MC,
MH1C, MH2C, and MH3C, respectively, in contrast to 8.3 ± 4.7,
4.0 ± 1.7, and 1.48 ± 0.55 (mean ± s.e.m.; n = 4) %ID/g of CpG,
IFA(CpG), and PEG–CpG, respectively (Fig. 2d, Supplementary
Fig. 15a–c). On day5, 2.5 ± 1.3, 37.3 ± 6.1, 38.6 ± 3.4,37.6 ± 1.8
(n = 4) %ID/g of CpG, MH1C, MH2C, and MH3C, respectively,
were detected in IN LNs (Supplementary Fig. 15d, e). MEB–CpG
derivatives were also observed in organs such as liver, kidney, and
small intestine, presumably because of the ubiquity of albumin as

 well as the metabolism and renal clearance of CpG derivatives.
Taken together, MH2C, which showed strong binding affinity
with mouse serum albumin (MSA) (Kd = 1.0 μM; R2 = 0.90)
(Supplementary Fig. 16), was selected as the optimized AlbiCpG
for further studies (Supplementary Fig. 11g). The efficient
delivery of AlbiCpG was also verified by the purplish MEB color
and strong MEB fluorescence of draining LNs (Supplementary
Fig. 17). Overall, the efficient LN delivery of albumin/AlbiCpG
nanocomplexes was attributed to a combination of relatively large
sizes (d: ~13.0 nm; Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 18), prolonged
LN retention and efficient uptake by APCs (discussed below).
Worth noting, AlbiCpG elicited less serum IL-6 and IL-12p40
than free CpG early after injection (Fig. 2f and Supplementary
Fig. 19a) and milder splenomegaly (Fig. 2g and Supplementary
Fig. 19b), suggesting the amelioration of acute systemic toxicity of
CpG by reducing systemic dissemination45.

was further mapped by light sheet fluorescence microscopy
(LSFM), which allows for higher resolution, 3D imaging of whole
tissues with low photobleaching. Specifically, 1 day post s.c.
injection of AlbiCpG-Alexa488 (higher photostability of Alexa488
than MEB) in C57BL/6 mice, draining IN LNs were resected and
“cleared” to be transparent using passive CLARITY technique
(PACT)46 (Fig. 3a). LSFM of the cleared LNs mapped the 3D
distribution
of
intranodal
AlbiCpG,
which
was
especially
abundant within or near the subcapsular sinus areas and around
B cell follicles, as verified in LN slices (Fig. 3b, c, Supplementary
Fig. 20, and Supplementary Movies 2 and 3).
We further analyzed the intracellular delivery of albumin/
AlbiCpG nanocomplexes in APCs, a pivotal process for potent
immunomodulation.
Premixed
MSA-FITC
and
AlbiCpG-
Alexa555 were injected s.c. at the tail base of C57BL/6 mice.
B220+ B cells, CD11c+ DCs, and F4/80+ macrophages were
analyzed by flow cytometry on day 1 and day 3 post injection
(Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 21a, b). On day 1, 43% DCs and

 27% macrophages were AlbiCpG+, and 28% DCs and 18%
macrophages were AlbiCpG+MSA+, suggesting efficient uptake of
albumin/AlbiCpG nanocomplexes. By contrast, only <1% B cells
were AlbiCpG+, despite 7% MSA+ B cells. On day 3, 27% DCs,
55% macrophages, and 14% B cells were AlbiCpG+. MSA-FITC
was only marginally detected, likely due to exhaustion. Efficient
uptake of AlbiCpG was recapitulated in RAW264.7 macrophages
and bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) by γ counting
of
64Cu-labeled
AlbiCpG,
confocal
microscopy,
and
flow
cytometry (Supplementary Fig. 21c–e). Deconvoluted confocal
microscopy revealed ubiquitous AlbiCpG-Alexa555 in BMDC
endolysosomes, and intriguingly, primarily on the endolysosome
membranes wherein TLR9 resides47 (Fig. 3e, Supplementary
Fig. 21f, and Supplementary Movie 4).
To study the intracellular vaccine delivery in APCs, we
exploited instant SIM, a super-resolution imaging system that
features ultrafast acquisition (up to 100 Hz) of 3D super-
resolution images41. Dye-labeled MSA was rapidly endocytosed
into BMDC endolysosome (Supplementary Fig. 21g), where MSA
was co-localized with AlbiCpG when premixed MSA-Alexa555/
AlbiCpG-Alexa488 was added to BMDCs (Fig. 3f), recapitulating
intracellular co-delivery of albumin/AlbiCpG nanocomplexes by
endocytosis. Albumin/AlbiCpG nanocomplexes upregulated the
expression of costimulatory factor CD80 on DCs in draining LNs
of C57BL/6 mice, despite accompanying lymphadenopathy
(Supplementary Fig. 22a, b). In RAW264.7 macrophages and
BMDCs,
albumin/AlbiCpG
nanocomplexes
upregulated
the
expression of CD80 and CD86, and potently stimulated the
production of TNFα, IL-6, and IL-12p40 (Supplementary Fig.
22c, d).
We then studied co-delivery of CpG and Ag by albumin/
AlbiVax. We modified SIINFEKL, an epitope of ovalbumin
(OVA), with cysteine for MEB conjugation and with FITC on
lysine, which retained epitope binding ability to H-2Kb MHC
class I48. The resulting MEB-CSIINFEK(FITC)L (denoted as
AlbiCSIINFEK(FITC)L) was mixed with AlbiCpG-Alexa555 and
s.c. co-injected at the tail base of C57BL/6 mice. After 1 and
3 days, IN LN DCs and macrophages, but not B cells, showed
high uptake per cell (median fluorescence intensity, MFI) of both
AlbiCpG and AlbiCSIINFEKL (Supplementary Fig. 23), with
15–20%
AlbiCpG+AlbiCSIINFEKL+
DCs
and
macrophages
(Fig. 3g), demonstrating efficient intracellular co-delivery of
CpG and peptide Ag to LN APCs. Super-resolution imaging using
instant SIM revealed that AlbiCSIINFEK(FITC)L and AlbiCpG-
Alexa555 were co-localized in BMDCs within 2 h, recapitulating
efficient intracellular co-delivery of CpG and Ag via albumin/
AlbiVax (Fig. 3h). Moreover, some AlbiCSIINFEK(FITC)L was also
located in the cytosol. Relative to CpG + CSIINFEK(FITC)L,
AlbiCpG + AlbiCSIINFEK(FITC)L resulted in efficient and sus-
tained antigen presentation in BMDCs (Fig. 3i and Supplemen-
tary Fig. 24a). The intracellular co-delivery was likely mediated by
binding of AlbiCpG and AlbiCSIINFEKL with separate albumin
molecules, because Förster resonance energy transfer between
AlbiCpG-Alexa555 and AlbiCSIINFEK(FITC)L was undetectable
in the presence of albumin (Supplementary Fig. 24b). We
hypothesize that albumin/AlbiVax would dissociate in the acidic
endolysosome, as evidenced by 20-fold weaker binding affinity of
AlbiCpG with MSA at pH 5 than at pH 7.4 (Supplementary
Fig. 24c). This dissociation will likely liberate AlbiVax, thereby
preventing AlbiVax from trafficking out of APCs together with
recycling albumin, and enhancing intracellular immunostimula-
tion of AlbiCpG and cytosolic delivery of Ag.
AlbiVax elicited potent and durable T cell responses. Albumin/
AlbiCpG nanocomplexes were then studied for T cell responses
with OVA. Compared with CpG + OVA, AlbiCpG + OVA (i.e.,
AlbiVax)-pulsed BMDCs markedly enhanced the proliferation of
OT-1 CD8+ T cells (Supplementary Fig. 25a), suggesting that
albumin/AlbiCpG promoted antigen cross presentation. We then
immunized C57BL/6 mice with 2 nmol AlbiCpG and 10 μg OVA
on day 0 and day 14, and stained CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood
using a H-2Kb-SIINFEKL tetramer on day 21 (Fig. 4a and Sup-
plementary Fig. 25b). The frequencies of tetramer+CD8+ T cells
were 2.9 ± 0.2% (n = 5) induced by CpG + OVA, 3.8 ± 0.2% (n =
5) by CpG + OVA emulsified in benchmark IFA, and by contrast,
16.5 ± 2.56% (n = 7) by AlbiCpG + OVA (p < 0.01). No sig-
nificant T cell responses were induced by control AlbiGpC +
OVA, again indicating low immunogenicity of the MEB moiety.
AlbiCpG + OVA increased the repertoires of polyfunctional IFNγ
+, TNFα+, and IFNγ+TNFα+ peripheral CD8+ T cells, thus
potentiating the cytotoxicity of CTLs (Fig. 4b and Supplementary
Fig. 25c). AlbiCpG + OVA enhanced the serum titers of Ag-
specific IgG2a, which benefits cancer therapy (Supplementary
Fig. 25d). Upon immunization with AlbiCpG + OVA, 16.7 ± 3.2%
(n = 5) of total peripheral CD8+ T cells expressed immune
checkpoint PD-1 (Supplementary Fig. 25e, f). Among SIINK-
FEKL+CD8+ T cells, this frequency increased to 86.1 ± 6.1% (n =
7), and the PD-1 MFI was fivefold higher than that on total CD8+
T cells (Fig. 4c). The upregulated PD-1 expression upon AlbiVax
elicited T cell activation suggests chronic antigen stimulation that
eventually caused T cell exhaustion. Compared with total CD8+
T cells, these differential phenotypic characteristics of Ag-specific
CD8+ T cells indicate that Ag-specific CD8+ T cells exhibit a
more exhausted state upon vaccination, in line with clinical
observations4,49.
Given
low
spontaneous
antitumor
T
cell
responses in cancer patients and low to medium response rates of
immune checkpoint blockade, the above observations provide the
rationale to simultaneously elicit T cell responses and enhance the
response rates to checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1, for
optimal therapy. A second boosting vaccination on day 28 further
expanded the frequency of Ag-specific CD8+ CTLs to 21.0 ± 2.5%
(n = 7) on day 35. This frequency remained >5% by day 70
(Fig. 4d), indicating immune memory, which was further
demonstrated by a large repertoire of SIINKFEKL+ central
memory T cells (CD8+CD44+CD62Lhigh) on day 70 (Fig. 4e and
Supplementary Fig. 26). On day 71, immunized mice were s.c.
challenged with 3 × 105 EG7.OVA cells. Marginal survival bene-
fits were observed in mice vaccinated with CpG + OVA, despite
early delay of tumor progression. IFA(CpG + OVA) moderately
protected against challenge. By contrast, AlbiCpG + OVA sig-
nificantly protected mice from challenge, with 71% (5/7) mice
remaining tumor-free for more than 3 months (Fig. 4f, g). The
surviving mice were re-challenged s.c. with 3 × 105 EG7.OVA
cells 120 days after 1° challenge, and 4/5 mice survived the 2°
challenge for more than 6 months, again demonstrating durable T
cell responses elicited by albumin/AlbiVax nanocomplexes. Of
note, the binding of AlbiCpG with OVA (Kd = 2.3 μM; R2 = 0.96.
Supplementary Fig. 25g) likely contributed to co-delivery of
AlbiCpG and OVA to LNs and T cell responses.
We then investigated AlbiCpG + OVA for immunotherapy of
established tumors. C57BL/6 mice were s.c. inoculated with 3 ×
105 EG7.OVA, primed on day 6 post inoculation (~35 mm3
tumors), and boosted on day 12 and day 18 (2 nmol CpG, 20 µg
OVA). While CpG + OVA moderately retarded tumor progres-
sion, AlbiCpG + OVA markedly regressed tumors in all mice
upon boosting (Fig. 4h). The eventual tumor recurrence likely
resulted from immunoregulatory checkpoints, such as PD-1 on
CD8 CTLs and PD-L1 on EG7.OVA cells (Supplementary
Fig. 27a), and combination of AlbiCpG + OVA with anti-PD-1
would likely reduce tumor recurrence. While depletion of CD4+
T cells or natural killer 1.1 (NK1.1) cells marginally affected the

 therapeutic outcome of AlbiCpG + OVA, depletion of CD8+
T cells nearly completely neutralized its efficacy, suggesting the
central role of CD8+ CTLs in AlbiVax-based immunotherapy
(Fig. 4h). To study the Ag specificity of immunotherapy, C57BL/6
mice were s.c. inoculated with 3 × 105 EL4 cells (OVA−) on the
left shoulder and 3 × 105 EG7.OVA on the right shoulder.
Treatment with AlbiCpG + OVA again regressed 4/6 EG7.OVA
tumors, whereas EL4 tumor progression was barely affected
(Supplementary Fig. 27b, c), thus confirming the Ag specificity of
AlbiVax-mediated
immunotherapy.

elevated frequency of peripheral SIINFEKL+CD8+ CTLs (Supple-
mentary Fig. 27d). Moreover, no morbidity or toxicity was
observed in AlbiVax-treated mice (Supplementary Fig. 27e).

 (Trp2), was used in this study. Trp2 modified with an N-terminal
cysteine was conjugated with MEB. Hydrophilic MEB increased
the water solubility of MEB–Trp2 conjugate relative to Trp2,
resulting in self-assembled amphiphilic MEB–Trp2 nanoparticles
in aqueous solution (Fig. 5a). MEB–Trp2 was tightly bound to
albumin (Kd = 0.79 μM. R2 = 0.88), which drove the transforma-
tion from MEB–Trp2 (AlbiTrp2) amphiphilic nanoparticles to
albumin/AlbiTrp2 nanocomplexes and recovered MEB fluores-
cence (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 28). Trp2 delivery was
quantitatively imaged by PET in FVB mice s.c. injected with
64Cu-labeled AlbiTrp2 at the tail base. While Trp2 was rapidly
disseminated systemically, leaving no detectable Trp2 in draining
LNs, albumin/AlbiTrp2 nanocomplexes were efficiently delivered
to LNs with 91-fold larger AUC than Trp2 over 3 days (Fig. 5b,
c). By contrast, IFA-emulsified Trp2 dramatically retained Trp2
at the injection sites, which might not only sequestrate, but also
disarm and delete Ag-specific CD8+ CTLs.
Syngeneic
C57BL/6
mice
vaccinated
with
AlbiVax
(i.e.,
AlbiCpG + AlbiTrp2) significantly resisted a s.c. challenge of
3 × 105 B16F10 cells, in contrast to marginal protection by CpG +
Trp2 or IFA(CpG + Trp2) (Supplementary Fig. 29a). In B16F10
tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice, PET verified that both AlbiCpG
and AlbiTrp2 were efficiently delivered to LNs, except for tumor
draining LNs due to damaged lymphatic drainage in tumors
(Supplementary Fig. 29b–e). For immunotherapy, C57BL/6 mice
s.c. inoculated with 3 × 105 B16F10 cells were treated with
AlbiVax (2 nmol CpG equivalent, 20 µg AlbiTrp2) on day 6, day
12, and day 18 post inoculation. While none of CpG + Trp2,
AlbiCpG + Trp2, or IFA(CpG + Trp2) significantly inhibited
tumor progression, albumin/AlbiVax nanocomplexes signifi-
cantly prohibited tumor growth (Fig. 5d). Given the high
expression of PD-L1 on B16F10 tumor cells (Supplementary
Fig. 29f), a combination of anti-PD-1 and albumin/AlbiVax
nanocomplexes enhanced the therapeutic efficacy (Fig. 5e). A
triple combination of anti-PD-1, albumin/AlbiVax nanocom-
plexes, and chemotherapeutic Abraxane that enhances tumor
immunity50,51, further inhibited the tumor progression (Fig. 5f).
No tumors were eradicated, but we envision that enhanced
therapeutic efficacy can be achieved using multi-epitope albumin/
AlbiVax to induce a broader spectrum of antitumor T cell
responses, or by combining with more synergistic therapeu-
tics16,32. Taking advantage of the systemic T cell responses
induced by albumin/AlbiVax, we then investigated immunother-
apy of metastatic melanoma, a primary death cause of melanoma
patients. A lung metastatic B16F10 model was established by
intravenous (i.v.) injection of 1 × 105 B16F10-fLuc cells into
C57BL/6 mice. When lung metastases were established, mice were
again treated with AlbiVax on day 6, day 12, and day 18, and
anti-PD-1 on day 6, day 9, day 12, day 15, and day 18 post-cell
injection. Lung metastatic B16F10-fLuc burdens were monitored
by bioluminescence imaging (Fig. 5g, h). Neither CpG + Trp2 nor
anti-PD-1
alone
significantly
inhibited
tumor
progression,
whereas albumin/AlbiVax inhibited the deposition and progres-
sion of lung metastases (Fig. 5i, j). Again, combining albumin/
AlbiVax nanocomplexes and anti-PD-1 further potentiated the
therapeutic efficacy.
Neoantigen-based albumin/AlbiVax for tumor immunother-
apy. We next explored albumin/AlbiVax nanocomplexes for
neoantigen-based personalized tumor immunotherapy. We used
Adpgk, a neoantigen [ASMTN(R → M)ELM] in MC38 tumors6.
The conjugation of hydrophilic MEB improved the water solu-
bility of MEB-Adpgk, and entailed MEB-Adpgk to strongly bind
to albumin (Kd = 1.1 μM. R2 = 0.96) and form amphiphilic
nanoparticles in aqueous solution (Supplementary Fig. 30a, b).
Using
64Cu-labeled NMEB-Adpgk (denoted MEB-Adpgk as
AlbiAdpgk), PET demonstrated efficient LN delivery of albumin/
AlbiAdpgk, and the AUC in IN and AX LNs was 43-fold higher
than that of Adpgk within 2 days (Fig. 6a and Supplementary
Fig. 30c, d). IFA(Adpgk) was again trapped in the injection sites,
and despite the particulate formulation of AlbiAdpgk, sig-
nificantly less AlbiAdpgk was trapped at the injection sites than
IFA(Adpgk) (Supplementary Fig. 30e), which is particularly sig-
nificant for subunit Ag-based vaccination to prevent the dys-
function of functional CD8+ CTLs. Immunization of C57BL/6
mice with AlbiVax (AlbiCpG + AlbiAdpgk) on day 0 and day 14
elicited 14.1- and 13.6-fold greater frequency of peripheral Adpgk
+CD8+
CTLs
than
CpG + Adpgk
and
IFA(CpG + Adpgk),
respectively, as stained using a H-2Db-ASMTNMELM tetramer
(Fig. 6b, c). Albumin/AlbiVax upregulated PD-1 expression on
peripheral CD8+ CTLs, especially Adpgk+CD8+ CTLs (Fig. 6d),
suggesting that T cell responses were accompanied with T cell
exhaustion that justified PD-1 blockade for optimal therapy.
Further, albumin/AlbiVax induced central T cell memory for over
50 days (Fig. 6e). Immunizing C57BL/6 mice with AlbiVax on
day 0 and day 14 markedly retarded MC38 tumor progression
after s.c. challenge with 3 × 105 MC38 cells on day 30 (Supple-
mentary Fig. 30f).
To study albumin/AlbiVax nanocomplexes for personalized
immunotherapy of MC38 tumor, the Adpgk variant was verified
in MC38 cells by exome sequencing (Fig. 6f). A total of 3 × 105
MC38 cells were s.c. inoculated in C57BL/6 mice, and treatment
was initiated on day 6 when tumors were established (~30 mm3).
In contrast to the moderate inhibition of tumor progression by
IFA(CpG + Adpgk), albumin/AlbiVax inhibited tumor progres-
sion significantly more effectively (Fig. 6g). Most tumors failed to
regress, in part due to immune checkpoints PD-1 on CD8+ CTLs
(Fig. 6c) and PD-L1 on MC38 cells (Supplementary Fig. 30g).
Thus, by combining anti-PD-1 with AlbiVax, CD8+ CTLs
reinvigoration markedly increased the response rate and led to
complete regression of 6/10 tumors for 4 months (Fig. 6g and
Supplementary Fig. 30h). These tumor-free mice resisted a
rechallenge with MC38 cells, again suggesting long-term immune
memory. Lymphocyte depletion demonstrated that CD8+ T cells,
but not CD4 T cells or NK1.1 cells, were vital to AlbiVax-
mediated immunotherapy (Fig. 6h). Lung is a primary destination
of colon cancer metastases. Lung metastatic-like tumors were
established by i.v. injection of 1 × 105 MC38 cells into C57BL/6
mice. From day 10 post-tumor inoculation, mice were treated
with AlbiVax every 6 days for three times and anti-PD-1 every
3 days for six times. On day 40, the metabolic activity of lung
metastatic-like tumors was studied using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose
(FDG), as shown by PET-CT of PBS-treated mice (Supplemental
Fig. 30i). Organs of interest were resected, weighted, and
radioactivity was measured by γ counting. Tumor burdens
(Fig. 6i, j) and FDG radioactivity (Fig. 6k and Supplemental
Fig. 30j) of lung metastatic-like tumors suggest that albumin/
AlbiVax significantly reduced tumor progression, and combina-
tion with anti-PD-1 further potentiated the therapeutic efficacy
(Fig. 6k).
Discussion
Safe and robust T cell vaccines would hold great promise for
combination
cancer
immunotherapy.
Locally
administered
vaccines must provide efficient delivery to LNs for effective
antitumor immunomodulation. Nanovaccines are a promising
approach for efficient vaccine delivery to LNs, and quite a few
have been developed preclinically, yet the clinical translation
of these nanoformulas has been hindered by limitations in
their safety, suitability for reproducible large-scale manufacturing,

 and in vivo integrity. We chose albumin, one of the most suc-
cessful carriers of nanomedicines in the clinic, to deliver anti-
cancer molecular vaccines in this study. We exploited the ability
of clinically safe EB to bind with endogenous albumin and to
concentrate within LNs, and we engineered AlbiVax by con-
jugating EB derivatives with molecular vaccines to efficiently co-
deliver adjuvant and peptide Ags into LNs for combination
cancer immunotherapy. In contrast to synthetic nanomedicines,
such
as
Abraxane,
albumin/AlbiVax
nanocomplexes
were
assembled from endogenous albumin and exogenous molecular
vaccines in vivo. This approach is intrinsically attractive for
multiple reasons. First, EB-based AlbiVax has shown a good
safety profile. EB had been considerably practiced in the clinic,
and currently no side effects of EB derivatives were observed in
mice or in two clinical trials of systemically or locally injected EB
derivatives in hundreds of patients and healthy volunteers36,39.
Moreover, rhesus monkeys survived 25 mg kg−1 systemically
injected EB40. Though the safety of albumin/AlbiVax nanocom-
plexes remains to be systematically determined, a low dose is
sufficient for potent immunization (0.4 mg kg−1 MEB equivalent,
<0.2% of dose used in the above monkeys). Moreover, local
administration and reduced systemic dissemination of AlbiVax
further mitigate toxicity risk. Second, chemically defined AlbiVax
are amenable to relatively easy large-scale manufacturing, for-
mulation, and quality control, and they offer long shelf-life.
Large-scale synthesis of AlbiVax via a biocompatible thiol-
maleimide conjugation is expected to be generally applicable for
molecular vaccines. Third, AlbiVax harnesses endogenous albu-
min to assemble nanocomplexes, thus avoiding the complications
involved with safety, large-scale production and quality control of
synthetic nanomaterials. Fourth, albumin/AlbiVax nanocom-
plexes
have
a
comprehensive
and
sophisticated
delivery
mechanism: efficient delivery to LNs by lymphatic drainage,
efficient intracellular delivery to APCs by endocytosis, and con-
ditional intracellular vaccine release by albumin/AlbiVax dis-
sociation in acidic endolysosomes. Efficient intracellular vaccine
delivery is essential for Ag cross presentation and robust T cell
responses.
Internalized
albumin/AlbiVax
nanocomplexes
in
APCs is dissociated in the acidic endolysosome, probably due to
loosened binding, thereby liberating AlbiVax for intracellular
immunomodulation and preventing AlbiVax from efflux during
albumin recycling. Fifth, EB-based AlbiVax is expected to be
widely applicable for therapeutics ranging from peptides, nucleic
acids, lipids, polysaccharides, to small molecules. AlbiVax was
synthesized via conjugation of MEB and a thiol that can be easily
modified for many chemical or biologic therapeutics; alter-
natively, we also developed EB derivatives with alkyne and amine
that
can
be
used
for
AlbiVax
conjugation.
Recombinant
albumin–drug conjugates, by contrast, can only be applied to
protein or peptide vaccines, which are inefficient at intracellular
vaccines release that is however pivotal for potent immunomo-
dulation; moreover, using endogenous albumin would obviate
problems resulting from contamination during biologics pro-
duction or immunogenic responses of exogenous albumin con-
jugates. Covalent conjugation of exogenous therapeutics to the
cysteine-34 position of endogenous albumin, though prolong
circulation, is limited again by inefficient intracellular vaccine
release and nonspecific conjugation with other cysteine-accessible
biomolecules including apolipoprotein B-100. Compared with
albumin-binding peptides and hydrophobic lipids, hydrophilic
EB derivatives may improve drug formulation especially for
hydrophobic drugs, and avoid off-target interactions with sur-
rounding biomolecules or cell membranes52. PEG can improve
the aqueous solubility, but also adds up cost and increases the risk
of allergy against PEG53, especially when an immunostimulatory
adjuvant is co-administered.
We systematically and quantitatively studied vaccine delivery
and revealed the spatiotemporal intranodal and intracellular
behaviors of AlbiVax by multiscale imaging, including PET in
small animals, light sheet fluorescence microscopy in whole LNs,
and super-resolution fluorescence imaging in single APCs.
Interestingly, super-resolution imaging allowed us to reveal that
AlbiCpG was located primarily on APC endolysosome membrane
likely due to binding to TLR9 on the membranes, and we
observed substantial co-localization of AlbiCpG and AlbiAg in
APCs as a result of albumin-mediated endocytosis. These
observations may provide insight for the underlying mechanism
of
AlbiVax-mediated
immunomodulation.
Albumin/AlbiVax
nanocomplexes co-delivered adjuvants and Ags to APCs and
enabled sustained Ag presentation on APCs. In mice, albumin/
AlbiVax nanocomplexes dramatically enhanced the potency and
durability of T cell responses, and significantly inhibited tumor
progression or eradicated tumors in multiple primary or meta-
static tumors. There are over 1000 clinical trials of combination
cancer
immunotherapy
involving
vaccines
currently
under
enthusiastic
pursuit54.
The
principle
that
albumin/AlbiVax
nanocomplexes are amenable for combination therapy with
immune checkpoint inhibitors and chemotherapy is encouraging
preclinical
evidence
supporting
AlbiVax-based
combination
immunotherapy.
Albumin/AlbiVax nanocomplexes are readily applicable to
neoantigen vaccination for personalized tumor immunotherapy.
Although tumor immunotherapy benefits from high loads of
tumor-specific mutations and high frequencies of neoantigen-
specific CTLs7,9,55–57, natural neoantigen-specific CD8+ CTLs are
often rare (e.g., 0.002–0.4% in melanoma, which already has the
second highest tumor mutation loads58,59), likely due to low
clonal neoantigen burden, inefficient antigen processing and cross
presentation, and immunosuppression. Exogenous neoantigen
vaccines delivered by albumin/AlbiVax nanocomplexes can
potentiate neoantigen-specific immunity and potentiate tumor
therapy. Further, combining checkpoint inhibitors with albumin/
AlbiVax nanocomplexes can further unleash CTL activity and
enhance therapeutic efficacy. While it currently takes a relatively
long time to identify and manufacture neoantigen-based AlbiVax,
patients can be treated with other regimens before AlbiVax.
In summary, by in vivo assembly with endogenous albumin,
albumin/AlbiVax nanocomplexes represent a widely applicable T
cell vaccine that, as quantitatively determined, is efficiently
delivered into LNs, ameliorates side effects, induces potent
and durable T cell responses, and as part of combination
immunotherapy inhibits or eradicates established tumors.
Methods
DNA synthesis. DNA was synthesized at a 1 µmole scale of solid phase synthesis
on an ABI 392 DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems) using materials purchased
from Glen Research (Sterling, VA) or Chemgenes (Wilmington, MA). DNA was
deprotected accordingly to the manufacturer’s instructions, and purified by reverse
phase HPLC (Dionex Ultimate 3000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).
Dimethoxytrityl (DMT) protecting group on DNA was removed using 0.5 M acetic
acid. DNA was desalted and quantified on a Genesys 10 s UV-Vis spectrometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Fluorophores, thiol, or HEG were
modified following the manufacturer’s instructions. All DNAs, including HEG
linkers, had phosphorothioate backbone. DNA modified with Alexa488 or
Alexa555 were from Integrated DNA Technology (Coralville, IA).
AlbiVax synthesis. CpG1826 (TCCATGACGTTCCTGACGTT) and GpC control
(TCCATGAGCTTCCTGAGCTT) were used. AlbiCpG or derivatives were syn-
thesized using MEB and terminal thiol-modified CpG. For AlbiCpG screening, four
CpG derivatives with 0, 1, 2, and 3 hexaethyloxy-glycol (HEG) units between MEB
(confirmed by NMR analysis)35 and CpG were used. Thiol-modified DNA was
pretreated with DTT (0.1 M) in PBS (37 °C, 1 h) to cleave the dithiol bond, fol-
lowed by desalting using a NAP5 column in sodium ascorbate buffer (0.1%) to
remove DTT and the thiol-appending small fragment cleaved from DNA. The
resulting DNA (200 nmol) was mixed with MEB (1 mg) in 2 mL sodium ascorbate

 buffer (0.1%) in PBS and reacted at room temperature for 30 min. The resulting
product was purified again using a NAP5 column to remove excess MEB, and
quantified by UV absorbance at 260 nm (where MEB has negligible absorption
compared with CpG) or by weighing lyophilized products in the case of synthesis at
a relatively large scale.
MEB–antigen conjugates were synthesized using MEB and antigens
(CSIINFEKL, Trp2, and Adpgk) that were modified with N-terminal cysteine.
(Trp2: CSVYDFFVWL; Adpgk: CGIPVHLELASMTNMELMSSIVHQQVFPT.) In
a typical reaction, MEB (10 mg) dissolved in water (1 mL) was added to peptide
(10 mg) dissolved in DMF (2 mL) dropwise. The reaction mixture was agitated at
room temperature for at least 1 day. MEB–antigen conjugates were purified using a
C18 column on HPLC.
AlbiVax was verified using liquid chromatography–electrospray
ionization–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–ESI−MS).
AFM and TEM. The sizes and morphologies of nanomaterials were characterized
using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy
(AFM). TEM samples of AlbiVax or a mixture of AlbiVax and HSA were prepared
by depositing samples (10 µL) onto a carbon-coated copper grid. For AFM, samples
(10 µL) were casted on freshly peeled mica substrate, followed by drying, rinsing,
and dehumidifying. AFM was carried out in tapping mode in air on a PicoForce
Multimode AFM (Bruker, CA) equipped with a Nanoscope® V controller, a type E
scanner head, and a sharpened TESP-SS (Bruker, CA) AFM cantilever. AFM
images were then analyzed by Nanoscope Software (version 7.3–8.15, Bruker, CA).
Molecular docking and prediction of albumin/MEB binding. The HSA model
was constructed using SwissPdb Viewer60,61 based on the X-ray complex structure
of indoxyl sulfate with HSA (Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID code 2BXH)33, with the
ligand and water molecules removed. The stereochemical restraints were obtained
from the CHARMM molecular mechanics force field62. The model was then cal-
culated via cycles of geometry optimization and molecular dynamics simulation
using NAMD63, with energy-minimized HSA structure. The stereochemical quality
was analyzed using PROCHECK64.
Automated molecular docking was conducted using AutoDock version 4.2.665.
The Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA) was applied to model the binding of
MEB with HSA. For molecular docking, LGA describes the relationship between a
ligand and a protein by the translation, orientation, and conformation of the
ligand. The final solution provides a ligand conformation finely tuned to the
protein66. The docking area (active site) of HSA was defined using the AutoDock
module AutoGrid. The grid site was constrained to a 28.5 Å cubic space, including
the entire binding site of HSA and providing sufficient space for translational and
rotational walk of the ligand. The LGA was applied to search the conformational
and orientational space of MEB while keeping the HSA structure rigid. Default
parameters were used, except the maximum energy evaluations of 1.5 × 106. With
10 independent runs, a maximum of 2.7 × 104 genetic algorithm operations were
generated on a single population of 50 individuals. Further, binding free energy and
affinity constant were calculated, and the docked complex was selected based on
matching interaction energies with geometric quality. Further energy minimization
and geometric optimization were performed on the select complex until no more
conflicts among the ligand and HSA.
A score function at binding free energy was derived and adopted in
AutoDock65, based on the traditional molecular force field model of interaction
energy. The restriction of internal rotors, global rotation, and translation were
modeled depending on the calculated torsion angles of the ligand. The total binding
free energy was empirically calibrated, using 30 structurally known protein–ligand
complexes with experimentally determined binding constants. The score function
is sufficient to rank the ligands on level of binding affinity and free energy
(ΔGbinding values), as well as the inhibition constant (Ki). With this approach, we
then calculated the binding free energy and inhibition constant.
Photophysics of MEB–DNA. Photophysics of MEB–DNA was studied in terms of
fluorescence spectrometry, intensity, and lifetime, in the absence or presence of
albumin. All measurements were conducted on a fluorometer (Jobin Yvon,
HORIBA) using excitation and emission parameters specific for MEB.
Kinetic binding assay by BLI. The kinetic binding of AlbiVax with albumin was
measured by BLI on an Octet Red96 system (fortéBio) using streptavidin-coated
biosensors (fortéBio). Assays were carried out with agitation in solid black 96-well
plates (Geiger Bio-One) in seven steps: 1, baseline (1x PBS), time: 60 s; 2, loading
(Biotin-labeled albumin, 1 µg mL−1), time: 600 s; 3, baseline (1× PBS), time: 60 s; 4,
quenching (1 µg mL−1 Biocytin (Thermo Scientific)), time: 180 s; 5, baseline (1×
PBS), time: 60 s; 6, association, time: 600 s; 7, dissociation, time: 600 s. Nonspecific
binding was performed by measuring the binding of albumin-loaded biosensor to
buffer alone and blank biosensor to analytes. Data analysis and curve fitting were
performed using Octet Analysis software 7.0. Binding data were fitted with a
binding model of 1:1 ligand interaction using GraphPad Prism 7 (La Jolla, CA).
Animal studies. All animal work was conducted in appliance to the NIH Guide for
the Care and Use of Animals under protocols approved by the NIH Clinical Center
Animal Care and Use Committee. Female C57BL/6j mice (6–8 weeks. The Jackson
Laboratory) were used for fluorescence imaging of AlbiVax delivery, immunology
analysis, and tumor therapy studies. Female FVB mice (6–8 weeks) were used in all
PET studies of AlbiVax delivery in tumor-free mice as well as toxicity studies of
AlbiCpG.
PET imaging and biodistribution of AlbiVax. AlbiVax was radiolabeled with
64Cu for PET. To label 64Cu via chelation, a NOTA-functionalized MEB (NMEB)
was synthesized and conjugated with vaccines44. Specifically, 64CuCl2 was con-
verted to 64Cu-acetate by adding 0.5 mL of 0.4 M NH4OAc solution (pH 5.6) to 20
µL 64CuCl2. 64Cu-acetate solution (0.1 mL; 3–4 mCi) was added into a solution of
100 µg of CpG or NMEB-CpG or derivatives in water, or NMEB-Adpgk/NMEB-
Trp2 in DMSO (10 mg mL−1). The reaction was shaken for 0.5 h at 37 °C.
Thereafter, the radiochemical purity was determined using iTLC plates (Fisher
Scientific), developed in 0.1 M citric acid (pH 5). Crude reaction of CpG or NMEB-
CpG derivatives were purified on a Nap5 column (GE Healthcare) and the desired
product was eluted in saline. NMEB-Adpgk and NMEB-Trp2 were purified on a
C18 Sep-Pak (BOND-ELUT 100 mg, Varian); then NMEB peptides were eluted
from the cartridge using 70% ethanol and 30% PBS.
Female FVB mice (6–8 weeks) were used in all PET imaging studies in naive
mice. C57BL/6 mice (6–8 weeks) were used in PET imaging of tumor-bearing mice.
Mice were anesthetized using isoflurane/O2 (2% v v−1) before injection.
Anesthetized mice were injected s.c. at the base of tail with 64Cu-labeled vaccines
(4.44−5.55 MBq/120–150 μCi each mouse) in PBS (100 μL). At indicated time
points post injection, mice were scanned on an Inveon DPET scanner (Siemens
Medical Solutions, Malvern, PA). PET images were reconstructed without
correction for attenuation or scattering using a three-dimensional ordered subsets
expectation maximization algorithm. ASI Pro VMTM software was used for image
analysis. Regions of interest (ROI) were drawn on LNs to calculate the %ID/g.
The above mice were killed at specified time points. Organs and blood were
collected and wet weighed. The collected organs and blood, together with a series of
standard solutions, were measured for 64Cu radioactivity on a gamma counter
(Wallac Wizard 1480, PerkinElmer). The radioactivity of organs and blood was
converted to calculate the percentages of the injected dose (%ID) in organs of
interest and the percentages of the injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g).
LN clearing and light sheet fluorescence imaging of LNs. Draining LNs of
vaccinated C57Bl/6 mice were cleared using a modified PACT (passive CLARITY
technique)46. Particularly, female C57BL/6 mice (6–8 weeks) were injected with
AlbiCpG (5 nmol each mouse) s.c. at the base of the tail. After 24 h, transcardiac
perfusion was conduct with 6 mL PBS and then 6 mL 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA).
PFA-fixed LNs were then isolated and incubated at 4 °C overnight in hydrogel
monomer solution in PBS containing 4% acrylamide and 0.25% photoinitiator
2,20-Azobis[2-(2-imidazolin-2-yl) propane] dihydrochloride (VA-044, Wako
Chemicals USA). LNs infused with hydrogel monomer were degassed with nitro-
gen for 5 min and then incubated for 2 h at 37 °C to initiate tissue-hydrogel
crosslinking. LNs were then washed with PBS to remove excess hydrogel. For tissue
clearing, LN-hydrogel matrices were incubated in 8% SDS in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.5)
for 2 days at 37 °C with gentle shaking. LNs were cleared well and were then
washed with PBS for four times in 1 day.
To image cleared LNs, LNs were mounted in refractive index matching solution
(RIMS) with a refractive index (RI) of 1.46, for 1 day before imaging. RIMS was
prepared by adding 40 g Histodenz (Sigma D2158) in 30 mL 0.02 M PB (pH 7.5)
with 0.1% Tween-20 and 0.01% sodium azide. To mount LNs for imaging, LNs
were embedded in 2% agarose in a 500-mL syringe. Once agarose was gelled in the
syringe, the LN-gel matrices were push partially out of syringe and immersed in
RIMS for 1 day to allow RIMS to penetrate the agarose gel and create a
homogeneous imaging media.
Light sheet 3D imaging of LNs were performed on a Lightsheet Z.1 light sheet
microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC).
Cell lines and cell culture. EL4 and EG7.OVA cells were from Dr Joshua Farber’s
laboratory at NIAID, NIH. EL4 cells were cultured in RPMI medium with 2 mM L-
glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated FBS, and 1% penicillin and streptomycin; EG7.
OVA cells were cultured in RPMI medium with 2 mM L-glutamine, 10% heat-
inactivated FBS, and 0.4 mg mL−1 G418. MC38 cells were from Dr Robert Seder

the manufacturer’s instructions, including antibody dilution. Flow cytometry was
conducted on a BD LSRFortessa X-50 flow cytometer at the Core Flow Cytometry
Facility of Vaccine Research Center.
In vitro cell uptake of AlbiCpG in APC. In vitro cell uptake was first studied using
confocal laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry. FITC-labeled AlbiCpG
were incubated with RAW264.7 cells, DC2.4 cells, or BMDCs, and stained with
Lysotracker Red DND-99 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and 10 µg mL−1
Hoechst 33342 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) for 0.5 h in a cell culture incu-
bator at 37 °C, prior to observation. Cells were then washed with Dulbecco’s PBS
for three times before imaging on a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope (Ches-
terfield, VA). Alternatively, flow cytometry was used to study the cell uptake using
a BD Beckman Coulter flow cytometer (Brea, CA) or BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer
(San Jose, CA). For flow cytometric analysis, RAW264.7 cells, or DC2.4 cells, or
BMDC cells were seeded into 24-well plate, and 1 day later, cells were treated with
AlbiCpG for a specified time, followed by flow cytometric analysis. Flow cytometry
results were analyzed by using FlowJo V10 software.
In vitro cell uptake of AlbiCpG into APCs by γ-counting. The cell uptake of
AlbiCpG was also studied using 64Cu-labeled AlbiCpG. RAW264.7 cells or DC2.4
cells (2 × 105 cells per well) were seeded onto a 12-well plate, and 1 day later, cells
were treated with AlbiCpG (2 uCi per well) for a specified time, followed by
washing with Dulbecco’s PBS, treating cells with NaOH solution, and collecting the
resulting solution to measure the radioactivity on a γ counter.
Super-resolution imaging of intracellular AlbiCpG in APCs. Cultured cells were
treated with AlbiCpG for 2 h and washed with PBS. Endolysosome was stained
with LysoTracker Green (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manu-
facturer’s instruction. Cells were immersed in HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) during
imaging. Super-resolution imaging was conducted on an instant linear structured
illumination microscope (instant SIM) (built in Dr Hari Shroff Laboratory)41. On
iSIM, Alexa488-labeled AlbiCpG (Ex: 488 nm) and LysoTracker Red DND-99 (Ex:
561 nm) was used for imaging for a long duration. Images were deconvolved and
analyzed using home-built software41. Alternatively, confocal microscopy with
deconvolution was conducted on a Leica SP8 workstation (Leica Microsystem, IL).
On the Leica SP8 workstation, MEB fluorescence was monitored to image AlbiCpG
(Ex: 561 nm; Em: 600–670 nm), confirming that there was minimal overlap in
fluorescence between LysoTracker Green and MEB. Raw imaging results were
deconvolved and analyzed on the Leica SP8 workstation.
Proinflammatory factors. The concentrations of proinflammatory factors (TNFα,
IL-6, and IL-12p40) were measured using ELISA (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
according to the manufacturers’ instructions13. Cell culture medium from cells
treated in vitro was collected at the specified time points post treatment. Sera of
treated mice were collected at the specified time points post treatment. Medium or
sera were diluted according to the manufacturers’ instructions.
Splenomegaly. Female FVB mice (6–8 weeks. n = 5) were injected with uncon-
jugated CpG or AlbiCpG (5 nmol each mouse unless denoted otherwise). After
6 days, unless denoted otherwise, mice were weighted, spleens were collected, and
the splenomegaly was assessed by determining the ratio of (spleen weight)/(mouse
weight).
Costimulatory factors on APCs. CD80 and CD86 were profiled on cell surfaces of
RAW264.7 macrophages and BMDCs by flow cytometry. After treatment, cells
were dissociated using non-enzymatic dissociation buffer. Dissociated cells were
washed with PBS and resuspended in PBS for staining. To analyze costimulatory
factors on LN-resident APCs, draining inguinal LNs were collected from mice
treated with CpG or AlbiCpG (s.c. at the tail base), followed by physical tissue
dissociation using sharp needles. Cells were pipetted for a few times to further
dissociate cells, and filtered using a 40-µm cell strainer to remove tissue debris.
Cells were washed twice using PBS, counted, and stained in PBS with dye-labeled
antibodies at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by washing with PBS and flow cytometric
analysis. Flow cytometry results were analyzed by using FlowJo V10 software.
In vitro antigen cross presentation. CD11c+ BMDCs were isolated from female
C57BL/6 mice (6–8 weeks) using positive selection beads (Miltenyi), and treated
overnight with (OVA + AlbiCpG) vs. (OVA + CpG). OT-1 CD8+ T cells were
isolated, labeled with CFSE, and added to co-culture with the above BMDCs. After
2 days, cells were stained with DAPI and anti-CD8-APC, and T cell proliferation
was determined by divided viable (DAPI−) CD8+ cells in flow cytometry.
AlbiVax uptake in LN-residing APCs. Dye-labeled AlbiVax or MSA (CpG: 2
nmol equivalent; antigen: 20 nmol equivalent; MSA: 20 nmol) were s.c. injected at
the base of the tail of female C57BL/6j mice (6–8 weeks. n = 6–8). LNs were
isolated 1–3 days post injection. LNs were mechanically disrupted, pipetted, and
filtered using 40-µm cell strainers. Cells were blocked with anti-CD16/CD32 in FCS
buffer for 10 min, followed by staining for B cells (B220+), DCs (CD11c+), and
macrophages (F4/80+), and analyzed by flow cytometry for AlbiVax or MSA
fluorescence signal. Data were analyzed using FlowJo V10.
Anti-OVA IgG1. Female C57BL/6 mice (6–8 weeks. n = 5) were vaccinated with
AlbiCpG and OVA on day 0 and day 14. Peripheral blood was collected from
vaccinated mice on day 21. Blood cells were precipitated by centrifugation and
removed, and the resulting sera were enriched to measure anti-OVA IgG, IgG1,
IgG2a, and IgM. Sera were diluted 1000 times for ELISA analysis.
Tetramer staining and PD-1 expression on PBMCs. Mouse peripheral CD8+
T cells were stained for antigen-specific tetramer as described previously15. PE-
conjugated H-2Kb-SIINFEKL tetramer and H-2Db-ASMTNMELM tetramer
(manufactured at the NIH Tetramer Core Facility) were used for tetramer staining
of OVA-vaccinated mice and Adpgk-vaccinated mice, respectively. Briefly, mice
were treated with AlbiVax on day 0 and day 14. Blood was collected from the
treated mice on day 21. Blood cells were enriched by centrifugation. Red blood cells
were lysed using ACK lysis buffer for 10 min at room temperature. Blood clots were
removed using a filter. Cells were washed twice in PBS and cells were stained using
Live/Dead Fixable Green Dead Cell Stain Kit for 10 min at room temperature.
Staining was quenched and cells were washed with FCS buffer (PBS buffer with
0.1% FBS). Cells were then blocked with anti-CD16/CD32 for 10 min, followed by
adding a dye-labeled antibody cocktail (CD3-PerCP Cy5.5, CD8-APC-Cy7, Tet-
ramer-PE, PD-1-BV421) and staining at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were
then washed, and 100 μL Cytofix was added into each well to resuspend cells, and
cells were fixed at 4 °C for 20 min. Cells were then washed with Perm/Wash buffer,
and resuspended for flow cytometric analysis. Flow cytometry was conducted on a
BD LSRFortessa X-50 flow cytometer. Data were analyzed using FlowJo V10
version.
Intracellular cytokine staining in T cells. Female C57BL/6 mice (6–8 weeks. n =
5) were vaccinated with AlbiVax on day 0 and day 14. Peripheral blood was
collected from vaccinated mice on day 21. Red blood cells were removed by
incubating with ACK lysis buffer for 5 min and centrifugation for 10 min, and the
obtained lymphocytes were transferred into U-bottom 96-well plate in 200 µL T cell
culture media were: RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U mL−1 penn/
strep, 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol, 1x MEM non-essential amino acid solution, and
1 mM sodium pyruvate. Lymphocytes were pulsed with antigen epitopes (20 µg mL
−1) for 2 h, followed by adding GolgePlug Protein Transport Inhibitor containing
brefeldin A. Cells were then placed in a culture incubator for 4 h. Next, cells were
incubated with anti-CD16/CD32 for 10 min at room temperature, then the cells
were stained with anti-CD8-APC-Cy7 and DAPI for 20 min at room temperature.
Cells were washed and subsequently fixed using Cytofix (BD Biosciences), washed,
and permeabilized in 200 µL Cytoperm solution (BD Biosciences) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were washed using Perm/Wash Buffer (BD
Biosciences). Permeabilized cells were then stained using anti-IFNγ-PE and anti-
TNFα-FITC according to the manufactor’s guidance. Stained cells were then
washed and resuspended for flow cytometric analysis. Flow cytometry was con-
ducted on a BD LSRFortessa X-50 flow cytometer. Data were analyzed using
FlowJo V10 version.
Immune memory. Female C57BL/6 mice (6–8 weeks. n = 6–8) were vaccinated as
described above. Peripheral blood was collected to analyze antigen-specific CD8+
T cells and memory T cells. Immune memory was analyzed by flow cytometric
analysis of peripheral lymph node homing receptor, CD62L, and adhesion mole-
cule, CD44. Briefly, red blood cells were lysed using ACK lysis buffer, and blood
cells were then collected by centrifugation and washing with FCS buffer (PBS buffer
with 0.1% FBS). Cells were then blocked with anti-CD16/CD32 in FCS buffer for
10 min, followed by adding dye-labeled antibody cocktail (CD8-APC-Cy7, CD44-
PE-Cy5, CD62L-FITC, and dead cell-staining DAPI) and staining at room tem-
perature for 30 min. Cells were then washed, and 100 μL Cytofix was added into
each well to resuspend cells. Cells were allowed for fixation at 4 °C for 20 min. Cells
were then washed with Perm/Wash buffer, and resuspended for flow cytometric
analysis. Central memory CD8+ T cells were analyzed as CD44hiCD62Lhi CD8+
T cells; effector memory CD8+ T cells had variable to low levels of CD62L and high
CD44 levels; and naive CD8+ T cells had high levels of CD62L and low to inter-
mediate levels of CD44. Flow cytometry was conducted on a BD LSRFortessa X-50
flow cytometer. Data were analyzed using FlowJo V10 version.
1° tumor challenge was conducted by s.c. inoculation of tumor cells (3 × 105) on
the right shoulder. Tumor sizes were monitored every 3 days thereafter. If
applicable, 2° tumor challenge was conducted by s.c. inoculation of tumor cells

 (1 × 106) on the right flank of mice that survived the 1° tumor challenge. Tumor
sizes were again monitored every 3 days thereafter. Mice were killed if any
dimension of the tumor was close to or already exceeded 2 cm. Tumor volume was
calculated using the following formula:

Results were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 7 (La Jolla, CA).
Plasmid transfection of tumor cells. B16F10 and MC38 cells were transfected
with plasmid pcDNA3.1 (+)-Neo-fLuc for firefly luciferase expression. Briefly, 70%
confluent cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Two days after transfection, cells were treated
with Geneticin (0.4 mg mL−1) to screen cells that stably express firefly luciferase for
a total of 4 weeks. The resulting cells were confirmed for firefly luciferase
expression using bioluminescence imaging. Cells that expressed firefly luciferase
were further cultured in medium containing Geneticin (0.4 mg mL−1).
Tumor immunotherapy. For primary tumor models, female C57BL/6 mice
(6–8 weeks. The Jackson Laboratory. n = 6–8) were s.c. inoculated with EL4 cells,
or EG7.OVA cells, B16F10 cells, MC38 cells on the shoulder. Tumor growth was
monitored by caliper measurement. Mice were killedd when the maximal dimen-
sion of tumor reached about 2 cm. For a lung metastatic melanoma model, female
C57BL/6 mice (6–8 weeks) were i.v. injected with B16F10-fLuc cells or MC38 cells
(1 × 105 per mouse).
To study antigen specificity of immunotherapy, 2 × 105 EL4 lymphoblastoma
cells and 2 × 105 EG7.OVA (OVA expressing) were respectively inoculated on to
the left and right shoulders of C57BL/6 mice (6–8 weeks). Four groups of mice (6–7
mice per group) were respectively vaccinated with (1) PBS, (2) CpG and OVA, (3)
AlbiGpC and OVA, and (4) AlbiCpG and OVA (doses: 2 nmol CpG equivalents,
20 µg OVA), by s.c. injection in 50 µL volume at the base of the tail on day 3 and
day 9 post-tumor inoculation. Tumor sizes and mouse weights were monitored
every 3 days. Mice were killed on day 19 when one dimension of most EL4 tumors
was close to or already exceeded 2 cm. The tumor volume was calculated and
analyzed as described above.
A combination of immunotherapy (AlbiVax and anti-PD-1, Clone RMP1–14,
Bio X cell) and chemotherapy (Abraxane) for melanoma treatment was studied in
both a primary melanoma model and a lung metastatic melanoma model. In
primary tumor model, 3 × 105 B16F10 cells in 100 μL PBS were s.c. injected into the
right shoulder of C57BL/6 mice. On day 6 post-tumor inoculation, when
established tumors were palpable, mice were randomly divided into six groups
(6–10 mice per group) for treatment. The dose is 1.4 nmol CpG equivalents, 20 μg
Trp2 or AbTrp2, 200 μg anti-PD-1 (Bio X Cell, Inc., NH), and 20 mg kg−1
Abraxane (Celgene, MD). Vaccines were injected s.c. at the base of tail, anti-PD-1
was injected intraperitoneally, and Abraxane was injected i.v. Maintenance
treatment was performed at the following doses: anti-PD-1 every 3 days for a total
of five times, vaccines every 6 days for a total of three times, and Abraxane every
6 days for a total of three times. Tumor sizes and mouse weights were monitored
every 3 days. Mice were killed when one dimension of a tumor exceeded 2 cm or
ulceration developed. The tumor volume was calculated and analyzed as described
above. Results from two independent studies were pooled together. Results were
analyzed using GraphPad Prism 7 (La Jolla, CA).
In the lung metastatic B16F10 study, 1 × 105 B16F10-fLuc cells were injected i.v.
into C57BL/6 mice. On day 6 when lung metastasis is established, treatment was
initiated (vaccine: 2 nmol CpG equivalents, 20 µg Ag, every 6 days; anti-PD-1: 200
µg, every 3 days). The growth of luciferase transgenic tumors was monitored by
bioluminescence imaging after i.p. injection of an aqueous solution of D-luciferin
(0.1 ml, 30 mg mL−1, GoldBio, St. Louis, MO) on an IVIS Lumina (Caliper Life
Sciences). Bioluminescence in regions of interest (ROI) were quantified as total
flux. Mice were killed if they developed severe morbidity. Mice were all killed on
day 20 post inoculation, and lungs were collected to enumerate the counts of lung
metastatic nodules and measure lung weights.
In lung metastatic-like MC38 tumor studies, 1 × 105 MC38 cells were injected
i.v. into C57BL/6 mice. On day 10 when lung metastasis is established, treatment
was initiated (vaccine: 2 nmol CpG equivalents, 20 µg Ag, every 6 days; anti-PD-1:
200 µg, every 3 days). Mice were killed if they developed severe morbidity. At the
end of study, mice were i.p. injected with FDG (3.7 Mbq). Representative mice were
scanned by PET/CT on a nanoScan system (Mediso), and all mice were killed, and
lungs collected to measure lung weights and radioactivity by γ-counting.
In lymphocyte depletion, female C57BL/6 mice (6–8 weeks) were s.c. inoculated
with EG7.OVA or MC38 cells (3 × 105) on the right shoulder. On day 6 when
tumors were established, mice were divided into five groups to have comparable
tumor volumes (n = 5). Five groups of mice were respectively vaccinated with PBS
in group (1), and AlbiVax (2 nmol CpG equivalents and 20 µg OVA or AlbiAdpgk)
in groups (2–5), by s.c. injection in 50 µL PBS at the base of the tail on day 6, 12,
and 18 post-tumor inoculation. Meanwhile, on days 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 post-tumor
inoculation, mice in groups (2–5) were also intraperitoneally injected with PBS in
group (2), anti-CD4 in group (3), anti-CD8 in group (4), and anti-NK1.1 in group
(5) (antibody dose: 200 µg per mouse). Tumor sizes and mouse weights were
monitored every 3 days. Mice were killed when any tumor dimension was close to
or already exceeded 2 cm. The tumor volume was calculated and analyzed as
described above.
