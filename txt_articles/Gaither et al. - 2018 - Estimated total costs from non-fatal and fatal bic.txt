ABSTRACT
Introduction Emergency department visits and
hospital admissions resulting from adult bicycle trauma
have increased dramatically. Annual medical costs and
work losses of these incidents last were estimated for
2005 and quality-of-life losses for 2000.
Methods We estimated costs associated with adult
bicycle injuries in the USA using 1997–2013 non-fatal
incidence data from the National Electronic Injury
Surveillance System with cost estimates from the
Consumer Product Safety Commission’s Injury Cost
Model, and 1999–2013 fatal incidence data from the
National Vital Statistics System costed by similar
methods.
Results Approximately 3.8 million non-fatal adult
bicycle injuries were reported during the study period
and 9839 deaths. In 2010 dollars, estimated adult
bicycle injury costs totalled $24.4 billion in 2013.
Estimated injury costs per mile bicycled fell from $2.85
in 2001 to $2.35 in 2009. From 1999 to 2013, total
estimated costs were $209 billion due to non-fatal
bicycle injuries and $28 billion due to fatal injuries.
Inflation-free annual costs in the study period increased
by 137% for non-fatal injuries and 23% for fatal
injuries. The share of non-fatal costs associated with
injuries to riders age 45 and older increased by 1.6%
(95% CI 1.4% to 1.9%) annually. The proportion of
costs due to incidents that occurred on a street or
highway steadily increased by 0.8% (95% CI 0.4% to
1.3%) annually.
Conclusions Inflation-free costs per case associated
with non-fatal bicycle injuries are increasing. The growth
in costs is especially associated with rising ridership,
riders 45 and older, and street/highway crashes.
INTRODUCTION
The health benefits of bicycling include increased
physical
activity
and
improved
cardiovascular
health.1–3 Although these positive impacts are well
documented, a growing body of literature suggests
potential drawbacks to bicycling due to serious and
sometimes life-threatening injuries.4 5 Over the last
15 years in the USA, the incidence of hospital
admissions due to bicycle crashes increased by
120%.6 Given that costs resulting from a bicycle
injury are 20-fold higher for hospital-admitted
patients than for patients treated in the emergency
department (ED) and released, an increase in the
rate of admissions has major cost implications.7
Costs associated with bicycle injuries last were
reported for 2005. Estimated medical and work loss
costs
due to fatal
and
non-fatal bicycle-related
trauma exceeded $5 billion in the USA in 2005.8
Estimated quality-of-life costs of bicycle injuries were
$14.7 billion in 2000.9 Another study estimated
medical and work loss costs of bicycle-related brain
injuries at $3.9–6.0 billion in 2002.10 Motor vehicle
involvement increases severity and associated costs of
bicycle trauma.9 11 12 Males and teens/young adults
have disproportionately high bicycle-related trauma
costs.8 The only detailed analysis of bicycle injury
costs by demographic characteristics of riders is
from 2000.9 Previous studies are limited by the use
of only a year’s worth of cost data. Calculation of
costs
over
time,
including
non-fatal
and
fatal
crashes, will provide a more comprehensive report
of the societal burden of bicycle injuries.
W
e aim to estimate annual total costs (medical
costs, work losses and quality-of-life losses) asso-
ciated with non-fatal and fatal bicycle injuries of
adults ages 18 and over in the USA over time. For
non-fatal injuries, we use 1997–2013 incidence
data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance
System (NEISS) and unit cost estimates from the US
Consumer Product Safety Commission’s Injury Cost
Model (ICM). For fatal injuries, we use 1999–2013
incidence data from the Multiple Cause of Death
(MCOD) data files, with unit costs primarily from
the W
eb-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting
System (WISQARS). W
e seek to understand how
rider demographics (age, sex) and location of the
crash predict changes in total annual costs.
METHODS
Data sources
The NEISS database is a weighted national prob-
ability sample of consumer product-related injury
visits to EDs in a sample of approximately 100 US
hospitals. The NEISS database provides detailed
information on consumer product-related injuries,
including bicycles.13 W
e queried the NEISS data-
base for all bicycle-related injuries from 1997 to
2013 using NEISS product codes 5040 and 5033.
This code choice excludes mopeds and cycles that
do not have two wheels. Population projections of
injuries were created using the NEISS complex
survey design. W
e retained cases whose disposition
after treatment was coded as released, transferred
or admitted.
The MCOD file is maintained by the National
Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). NCHS col-
lects data from the 50 states, along with New York
City and W
ashington, DC, which are responsible
for registering deaths. It captures all deaths that
occur in the USA.14 Since 1999, the MCOD has
used the International Statistical Classification of
Diseases
and

Household Travel Survey Data Extraction Tool (http://nhts.ornl.

Costs
For both fatal and non-fatal bicycle injuries, we estimated
medical costs, work losses and quality-of-life losses per case.
When these costs are added together, they represent a total cost
to society. All costs are reported in inflation-free 2010 US
dollars; effects of price inflation have been removed.
Non-fatal injuries
W
e estimated costs resulting from non-fatal bicycle injuries using
the ICM.16
17 Detailed documentation of the ICM can be
found elsewhere7 but a brief overview of each component is
summarised here.
The ICM’s medical and work loss costs are constructed using
injury cases from two 2010 datasets of the Healthcare Cost and
Utilization Project—the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) and
the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS). The
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) receives
the hospital inpatient and ED discharge data from participating
states (45 in the NIS, 28 in the NEDS in 2010) and selects hos-
pitals from these states whose discharges constitute representa-
tive 20% samples of US inpatient stays and ED visits. ICM
developers analysed the cases from each dataset that represented
injuries
under
the
purview
of
Consumer
Product
Safety
Commission (CPSC).
Medical costs for hospital-admitted injuries began with the
hospital charge, which was multiplied by a facility-specific
cost-to-charge ratio to obtain the cost of the initial visit. This
was then multiplied by a series of factors to account for non-
facility costs, readmissions and short and long-term follow-up
costs. Where relevant, costs were added for rehabilitation and a
nursing home stay. For injuries treated in the ED and released,
cost of the initial ED visit, based on claims for outpatient ser-
vices in the 2010–2011 MarketScan Commercial Claims and
Encounters Database, was assigned by injury diagnosis. This was
multiplied
by
factors
representing
short
and
long-term
follow-up costs. For both hospital-admitted and ED-treated
injuries, an emergency transport cost was added. Finally, claims
processing cost was estimated as a percentage of the total, using
a percentage specific to the expected payer.
The estimated cost of lost work included both short-term
work
loss
and
long-term
disability.
The
diagnosis-specific
expected number of days lost was multiplied by the average daily
earnings and value of household production for a person of the
victim’s age and sex to arrive at short-term work loss. For per-
manent total disability, the present value of age-and-sex-specific
lifetime earnings and household production were multiplied by
the diagnosis-specific probability of permanent disability. For per-
manent partial disability, this was multiplied by an additional
factor identifying the average extent of disability resulting from
that type of injury. Costs in future years were discounted to
present value using a 3% discount rate. Summing short-term,
total disability and partial disability costs yielded total work loss.
Lost quality of life places a dollar value on the intangible
results of injury. CPSC’s ICM valued quality-of-life loss based
on
the
amount
juries
awarded
to
injury
victims
for
non-economic damages (losses excluding medical costs and
work loss). It estimated that loss based on a log-linear regression
with
dependent
variables
including
demographic,
product-
specific and injury-specific variables plus variables related to
the legal case. Importantly, 18% of the awards analysed com-
pensated bicycle or moped injury victims.7 As jury awards for
non-fatal injury are reasonably predictable, this method offers
a practical approach to estimating quality of life lost that yields
estimates consistent with approaches which measure quality-
adjusted life years lost.18 19Although this method has critics,20
CPSC chose it because it grounds CPSC regulatory analyses on
quality-of-life losses actually paid in product liability lawsuits.
US Department of Justice regulatory analyses also base their
quality-of-life loss estimates on jury verdicts.21
NEISS diagnosis and body part codes were merged onto
the NIS and NEDS cases. Mean medical, work loss and
quality-of-life loss costs were then estimated by NEISS diagnosis
and body part, age group (0–19, 20–54, 55–69, 70+) and sex.
When necessary, dimensions were collapsed to obtain reasonable
cell counts. The ICM cost estimates were then merged onto the
NEISS data by diagnosis, body part, age group and sex.
Fatal injuries
Our estimation of medical costs and work loss for fatal injuries
follows the methods of the WISQARS Cost of Injury Module.22
W
e summarise the methods briefly here.
Medical costs depend on the place of death. A death at the
scene of the crash incurs no medical cost. A death in a medical
facility—ED, hospital, nursing home or hospice—incurs a cost
that depends on the type of facility, the type of injury and the
patient’s age, plus the cost of emergency transport to the facility.
In addition, all deaths incur a small coroner fee, and any death
that results in an autopsy incurs an autopsy cost.
Lifetime productivity loss was estimated as the discounted
sum of expected annual earnings over the victim’s remaining
potential working life. For a given year, expected earnings are
the product of the sex-specific probability of surviving to the
next year of age times sex-specific expected earnings for
someone of that age. Parallel calculations valued lost household
work.
WISQARS does not estimate or value quality-of-life loss. W
e
used the average value of a year of life expectancy implicit in
the jury verdict values for non-fatal quality-of-life loss.18 W
e
multiplied this dollar amount by the discounted age and sex-
specific life expectancy of each victim. This procedure produces
an estimate consistent with the non-fatal quality-of-life loss costs
described above.
Statistical analysis
W
e used linear regression to estimate the average change in
inflation-free costs by year. W
e performed linear regression of
total costs by year, and then individually by medical costs, work
loss and quality-of-life loss. W
e then stratified our analysis and
performed linear regression on the proportion of total costs in
three demographic groups: age (bicycle riders ≥45 years of age
vs <45 years of age), sex (male vs female) and location of injury
(street incidents vs incidents that did not occur on a street). All
regression coefficients were considered statistically significant if
p<0.05.
RESULTS
Non-fatal injuries
Total costs
Approximately, 3.8 million non-fatal adult bicycle injuries were
reported during the study period (1997–2013). Total estimated
costs due to non-fatal adult bicycle injuries during this time
were approximately $227 billion in 2010 US dollars. The

 number of adult cycling injuries increased by approximately
6500 (95% CI 4728 to 8287) annually. Total annual costs
increased by 140% from $9.3 billion in 1997 to $22.4 billion in
2013. Each year, the total costs associated with non-fatal adult
bicycle trauma increased by an average of $789 million (95% CI
$647 to $930). Medical costs increased by 137% from $885
million in 1997 to $2.1 billion in 2013. Table 1 shows the mean
total cost per case, stratified by age, sex and location of injury.
On average, inflation-free costs due to riders older than 45
increased $2094 per case annually.
Medical, work loss and quality-of-life loss costs
Figure 1 shows the temporal trend in average medical, work
loss and quality-of-life loss costs per adult patient. Linear
regression by year shows an average increase per patient of
$159 (95% CI $129 to $190) in medical costs, $387 (95% CI
$291 to $482) in work loss and $1158 (95% CI $980 to
$1336) in quality-of-life loss. On the US population level, this
equates to an annual increase of $74 million (95% CI $59.8 to
$81.1) in medical costs, $181 million (95% CI $146 to $216)
in work loss and $534 million (95% CI $440 to $627) in
quality-of-life loss.
Rider demographics
The proportion of total adult bicycle injury costs stratified by
rider demographics can be seen in figure 2. The proportion of
costs due to riders age 45 and older increased an average of
1.6% (95% CI 1.4% to 1.9%) annually. In 2013, 53.9% of total

 costs were due to riders 45 and older, up from 26.0% in 1997
(107% increase). The proportion of costs due to incidents that
occurred on a street or highway also steadily increased by 0.8%
(95% CI 0.4% to 1.3%) annually. In 2013, 66.5% of total costs
were due to bicycle injuries on the street, up from 46.0% in
1997 (45% increase). There was no significant linear trend by
rider sex. In 2013, 77.3% of total costs were due to male riders.
Hospital versus ED admissions
Table 2 shows that adult hospital admissions increased signifi-
cantly over time, with mean cost per case increasing by $2911
(95% CI $157 to $5666) annually. ED-treated adult injuries
also significantly increased over time, with mean cost per case
increasing by $374 (95% CI $332 to $417) annually.
Fatal injuries
Total costs
Total estimated costs due to fatal adult bicycle crashes were $39
billion from 1999 to 2013 (table 3). Total costs due to fatal
injuries rose gradually by $28 million annually throughout the
time period; they averaged $1.85 billion (1.5%) per year.
Bicycling deaths increased by an average of 19 (95% CI 13 to
26) cases annually. Annual deaths due to bicycle crashes
increased in patients age 45 and older (23 cases, 95% CI 19 to
27) and decreased in patients younger than 45 (14 cases, 95%
CI 10 to 19). Cost per case steadily decreased by $28 280 (95%
CI $22 086 to $34 475) annually.
Estimated adult bicycle injury costs totalled $24.4 billion in
2013. Estimated injury costs per mile bicycled fell from $2.85
in 2001 to $2.35 in 2009.
DISCUSSION
This study aimed to evaluate trends in costs associated with non-
fatal and fatal bicycle injuries in the USA from 1997 to 2013
using incidence data from the federal databases and cost data
based on published ICMs used in federal regulatory impact ana-
lysis.9 Overall, costs due to non-fatal adult bicycle injuries
increased steadily since 1997 by an average of $789 million
annually. In 2013, we estimate adult bicycle injury costs totalled
$24 billion. For reference, this is approximately double the
medical and indirect costs associated with occupational illnesses
in 1 year in the USA.23 Injury costs of older riders and
non-admitted injuries in street crashes increased disproportion-
ately over time and raised total costs. Over time, men consist-
ently accounted for three-quarters of total costs.
The increasing incidence of bicycle-related trauma and hos-
pital admissions over the past 15 years only partly explained this
increase in real injury costs.6 Costs per survivor by treatment
setting also rose. Regardless of the year of injury, the ICM used
the same cost by age group and treatment setting for any given
injury, for example, a compound tibia fracture. Thus, the cost
increase must result from more severe injuries and older bicycle
riders who may require longer recovery periods. Rising injury

 severity is possibly caused by changes in motor vehicle traffic,
increasing commuting by bicycle, or changes in vehicle design.
Older riders accounted for a greater proportion of total costs
through time and a larger share of inpatient admission costs.
Costs associated with cycling coincide with a rising exposure
trend in both older adults and men.24 The number of bicycle
miles travelled per year by people age 45 and older increased
from 1905 million in 2001 to 3645 million in 2009.25 This cor-
responds to a 91% increase of exposure miles in 8 years in this
age group. Similarly, a rising exposure can be seen in male
cycling. The proportion of miles ridden by men rose from 0.73
in 2001 to 0.80 in 2009.24 Thus, rising costs in these two
demographic groups are driven by rising exposure.
Importantly, despite the rise in total injury costs, costs per
mile bicycled by adults fell by 17% from 2001 to 2009.
Unfortunately data are not available to assess if this fall resulted
from increasing adult helmet use.
In addition to rising exposures, the increasing prevalence of
older cyclists may be increasing costs due to more severe non-
fatal injuries. Others have identified age over 39 as a risk factor
for bicycle injury severity among admitted patients (OR=2.2
compared with younger adult patients).26 Relative to younger
riders, riders over age 55 have more than double the probability
of dying if injured in a bicycle-MVC, an indication that this is a
more vulnerable population.27 An analysis of head injuries from
bicycle crashes found that subdural haematomas, number of
contusions, intracerebral haematomas and intraventricular bleed-
ing increased with age.28 With comparable injuries, age is also a
risk factor for longer recovery times after injury.29 The mechan-
isms causing higher injury severity among the elderly merit
future research.
Street crashes represent an increasing proportion of total
costs compared with non-street incidents. These crashes often
involve motor vehicles, which increase velocity of crash impact
and consequently injury severity.26 27 30 Streets might also pre-
dispose to more injuries due to the coexisting environment with
urban areas, increased population density or the presence of
more
unyielding
street
furniture.31
Accumulating
evidence
suggests that bicycle-specific facilities, such as bicycle paths, may
reduce crashes and injuries on the roadway.4 32 33 Building such
infrastructure is costly and the cost-effectiveness of such envir-
onmental health interventions often lack sufficient evidence for
projects to move forward.34 Projected costs to rebuild an entire
274-mile bikeway network in the city of Portland are $57
million,35 which is about $208 000 per mile. The USA has an
estimated 8 656 070 bicycle lane miles.36 Thus, creation of a
bikeway network covering one-sixth of the entire USA would
cost approximately $300 billion, which roughly equals the total
costs of non-fatal and fatal bicycle injuries in the 10-year study
period ($293 billion). Although such infrastructure will not
prevent all injuries, costs associated with injuries must be taken
into account when determining the cost-effectiveness of bicycle-
specific infrastructure.37
Total cost of adult bicycle fatalities steadily decreased over
time. It is unclear if this resulted from shifts between age groups
in frequency of bicycle use and miles bicycled. However, total
cost per fatal injury is much larger in patients younger than 45
because work and quality-of-life losses fall as remaining life
expectancy declines. Therefore, increasing rider age results in a
falling mean cost of bicycle-related injuries. Decreased fatalities
in younger riders might result from increased helmet use. Since
1980, the mortality rate due to no helmet use has decreased by
an estimated 40%.38
The NEISS incidence data come from a sample of just 100
hospitals, which means that they might not be representative of
the US population. The reliability of NEISS trend analyses,
however, is enhanced because the same 100 hospitals were
sampled over time. Injuries treated only in physician’s offices or
ambulatory clinics are not captured in the NEISS dataset so
total cost was underestimated. The cost data came from multiple
sources, with each presenting the possibility of measurement
error and reporting bias. W
e deliberately ignored any medical
cost changes resulting from technological change or inflation.
Injury coding in the NEISS data is coarser than in the data sets
underlying the medical cost estimates, which reduces the accur-
acy of the NEISS estimates and its sensitivity to severity changes

 over time. W
e also excluded costs of property damage, police
and fire services, property insurance claims administration and
injury-related litigation. W
e were unable to provide information
about the heterogeneity of incidents or population density
where bicycle injuries occur. Costs due to loss of life are challen-
ging to estimate. The jury verdict method to value lost quality
of life is imperfect and only estimates quality-of-life losses to the
degree injuries in our study match those in litigation suits. Our
total costs’ estimates are thus influenced by choosing this
method for predicting quality-of-life loss. Future studies should
examine cost–benefit analyses for best practices to prevent
injury and thus costs. In particular, roadway infrastructure and
vehicle design might be incorporated in this analysis.
CONCLUSION
Costs per case of bicycle injury have risen steadily since 1997.
The growing costs resulted from increasing injuries among
riders age 45 and older and increases in street crashes. Society
bears a large direct and indirect financial burden secondary to
non-fatal and fatal bicycle injuries, suggesting a policy focus on
injury prevention.
What is already known on the subject
▸ Over the last 15 years, the incidence of bicycle trauma in
adults increased by 28%.
▸ In 2005, estimated medical and work loss costs due to fatal
and non-fatal bicycle-related trauma exceeded $5 billion in
the USA.
What this study adds
▸ Inflation-free costs per adult bicycle crash rose steadily from
1999 to 2013.
▸ The growing costs resulted from increasing ridership, share
of injuries among riders age 45 and older, and proportion of
street crashes.
▸ Costs per mile bicycled by adults fell from $2.85 in 2001 to
$2.35 in 2009.
▸ Costs associated with adult bicycle crashes exceeded $24
billion in 2013, approximately double the medical and
indirect costs of occupational injuries in the USA.
