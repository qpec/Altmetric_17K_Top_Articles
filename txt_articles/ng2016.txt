IMPORTANCE The association of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) and component
cardiovascular risk factors with the risk of developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
MCI progression to dementia is not well established.
OBJECTIVE To investigate the association of the MetS and its component cardiovascular risk
factors with the incidence of MCI and its progression to dementia.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective longitudinal study from September 1, 2003,
through December 31, 2009, in communities in 5 districts in the South East region of
Singapore. Study participants were a population-based sample of 1519 cognitively normal
adults 55 years and older.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Prespecified outcomes were incident MCI and MCI
progression to dementia.
RESULTS The study cohort comprised 1519 participants. Their mean (SD) age was 64.9 (6.8)
years, and 64.8% (n = 984) were female. Baseline characteristics associated with an
increased risk of incident MCI were MetS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.46; 95% CI, 1.02-2.09), central
obesity (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.01-1.98), diabetes mellitus (HR, 2.84; 95% CI, 1.92-4.19),
dyslipidemia (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.01-2.15), and 3 or more component cardiovascular risk
factors (HR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.13-2.33). Baseline characteristics associated with an increased risk
of MCI progression to dementia were MetS (HR, 4.25; 95% CI, 1.29-14.00), diabetes mellitus
(HR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.92-4.19), and 3 or more component cardiovascular risk factors (HR, 4.92;
95% CI, 1.39-17.4).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The MetS was associated with an increased incidence of MCI
and progression to dementia. Identifying individuals with diabetes mellitus or the MetS with
or without MCI is a promising approach in early interventions to prevent or slow progression
to dementia.

T
he metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a clustering of cardio-
vascular risk factors (CVRFs) (namely, obesity, diabe-
tes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia) that is
known to predict increased risks of cardiovascular disease and
stroke.1 Among them, diabetes mellitus in midlife and late life
is consistently and strongly associated with subsequent de-
mentia (particularly vascular dementia), as well as with mild
cognitive impairment (MCI), a predementia syndrome known
to confer an increased risk of progressing to dementia.2 Stud-
iesshowthathypertensioninmidlifeisstronglyassociatedwith
incidentdementiainlaterlife,particularlyvasculardementia,2
but late-life hypertension is not associated with dementia.3,4
There are contradictory reports of associations of body and fat
mass and total cholesterol level with incident dementia or vas-
cular dementia in the elderly.5-7
Evidence for an association between the MetS and the risk
of dementia is limited and conflicting. The MetS appears to in-
crease the rate of cognitive decline,8-11 but no association was
found among individuals 85 years and older.12 Several cross-
sectional and case-control studies have found the MetS to be
associatedwithoveralldementiaamongwomen9andwithAlz-
heimer disease (AD).13,14 Prospective cohort studies have re-
portedpositiveassociationsoftheMetSwithoveralldementia15
and vascular dementia,16,17 no association between the MetS
and incident dementia,18,19 and association of the MetS with
a lower risk of AD after age 75 years.19
Few studies20-23 have investigated the relationship be-
tween the MetS and MCI. One population-based cross-
sectional study20 found no association of the MetS with MCI
overall, and only the combination of the MetS and high levels
of inflammation was significantly associated with nonamnes-
tic MCI (na-MCI). Our group’
s previous case-control study21
showed an association between the MetS and amnestic MCI
(a-MCI). Among 2 prospective cohort studies, one study22
found that the MetS, hyperglycemia, and more CVRFs were as-
sociated with incident cognitive impairment (including MCI
and dementia) but had limited power to determine whether
the MetS was associated with incident MCI itself. The more re-
cent Italian cohort study by Solfrizzi et al23 reported no sig-
nificant differences in overall risk of developing incident MCI
among noncognitively impaired individuals with the MetS
comparedwiththosewithouttheMetSover3½yearsoffollow-
up, but the investigators found that among individuals with
MCI those with the MetS were more than 4 times more likely
to progress to dementia. In this study, we investigated the as-
sociation of the MetS and its component CVRFs with the
incidence of MCI and its progression to dementia over a me-
dian of 3.8 years of follow-up in a large Chinese population-
based sample.
Methods
Population
The Singapore Longitudinal Ageing Study (SLAS) is a popula-
tion-based study designed for long-term follow-up of a young
aging cohort (≥55 years) that aims to relate cardiovascular and
other risk factors measured in midlife and late life to subse-
quent risks of incident MCI and dementia. Details of the popu-
lation sampling and study methods of the first-wave recruit-
ment cohort (SLAS-1) among participants 55 years and older
have been described previously.24 Recruitment and baseline
assessments for 2804 participants were conducted in 2003-
2004, and approximately 3-year follow-ups were conducted
in 2005-2007 and 2007-2009. At baseline, each participant
underwent detailed structured interviews, clinical evalua-
tion, blood sampling, and performance-based tests for an
extensive range of demographic, medical, biological, psycho-
social, and neurocognitive characteristics. The study was ap-
proved by the National University of Singapore Institutional
Review Board, and written informed consent was obtained
from all participants.
The study sample was restricted to 2611 Chinese partici-
pants, after excluding Malay and Indian participants because
of small numbers. After excluding individuals with prevalent
MCI (n = 506) and dementia (n = 53) at baseline, a cohort of
2042 (the remainder had missing data) cognitively normal par-
ticipants with available data on the MetS and CVRFs were fol-
lowed up from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2009 (me-
dian follow-up, 3.8 years). During this period, 227 participants
died, and 296 participants were lost to follow-up. The longi-
tudinal analysis was based on 1519 individuals, with 5146 per-
son-years of follow-up (mean [SD], 3.4 [1.5] person-years) to
incident MCI (n = 141). Individuals who were excluded from
the analysis owing to death and loss to follow-up were signifi-
cantly more likely to be older, male, smokers, and less physi-
cally and socially active and to have diabetes mellitus.
Among 504 participants with MCI and available MetS data
at baseline, longitudinal data were analyzed for 425 persons
with 1529 person-years of follow-up to dementia progression
(n = 14), after excluding 79 individuals who died (n = 44) or
were lost to follow-up (n = 35). The excluded individuals
with MCI were significantly more likely to be smokers and less
physically and socially active and to have hypertension.
Measurements
Self-reports of a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, hyperten-
sion, heart disease, and stroke, with details of medications,
were ascertained by research nurses at the individual’
s home.

Key Points
Question: Are the metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its component
cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) associated with increased risks
of the development of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and MCI
progression to dementia?
Findings: In this prospective cohort study of 1519 cognitively
normal older adults, baseline MetS, central obesity, diabetes
mellitus, dyslipidemia, and 3 or more component CVRFs were
associated with increased risks of incident MCI. The MetS,
diabetes mellitus, and 3 or more component CVRFs among those
with MCI carried an increased risk of progression to dementia.
Meaning: The MetS and its components represent potential
targets for early intervention to prevent or slow MCI progression
to dementia.

seated was recorded using a standard mercury sphygmoma-
nometer (Dekamet; Accoson). Waist circumference was mea-
sured in centimeters at the midpoint between the lowest rib
margin and the top of the iliac crest at minimal respiration to
the closest 0.1 cm. Overnight fasting serum samples were ana-
lyzed for blood glucose and lipid levels using standard labo-
ratory techniques.
The MetS was defined using several International Dia-
betes Federation criteria.25 First was central obesity (waist
circumference ≥90 cm for men and ≥80 cm for women) plus
at least 2 CVRFs, including raised triglyceride levels (≥150
mg/dL) or specific treatment for this lipid abnormality (to
convert triglyceride levels to millimoles per liter, multiply
by 0.0113). Second was reduced high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol level (<40 mg/dL in men and <50 mg/dL in
women) or specific treatment for this lipid abnormality (to
convert cholesterol level to millimoles per liter, multiply by
0.0259). Third was raised blood pressure (systolic ≥130
mm Hg or diastolic ≥85 mm Hg or treatment of previously
diagnosed hypertension) and raised fasting plasma glucose
level (≥100 mg/dL or previously diagnosed type 2 diabetes
mellitus) (to convert glucose level to millimoles per liter,
multiply by 0.0555).
Neuropsychological Evaluation
Screening and assessment of cognitive impairment and de-
cline, as well as diagnosis of MCI and dementia, were
performed according to a standard clinical assessment for de-
mentia protocol. The Chinese modified version of the Mini-
Mental State Examination (MMSE) with education-stratified
norms26 (previously validated to have high sensitivity and
specificity) was used to screen for dementia and MCI.27 Par-
ticipants with a MMSE score below 27 or a MMSE score de-
cline of 2 points or at least 1 point per year underwent de-
tailed neuropsychological testing and the Clinical Dementia
Rating.
The neuropsychological evaluation with a standardized
test battery assessed included the following: (1) memory (Rey
Auditory Verbal Learning Test immediate and delayed recall28
and visual reproduction immediate and delayed recall29),
(2) executive function (Symbol Digit Modality Test,30 Design
Fluency,31 and Trail Making Test Part B32), (3) language (cat-
egorical verbal fluency31), (4) visuospatial skills (block
design29), and (5) attention (digit span forward and backward33
andspatialspanforwardandbackward29).Theassessmentwas
administeredbytrainedpsychologyresearchassistantsinEng-
lish, Mandarin, or Chinese dialects. Details of the neuropsy-
chological tests and their normative values have been de-
scribed previously.34,35
The Clinical Dementia Rating was conducted and scored
bytrainedresearchnurses(http://www.biostat.wustl.edu/~adrc
/cdrpgm/). Functional ability was assessed by dependency in
performing 10 basic activities of daily living, including bowels,
bladder, grooming, toilet use, feeding, transferring, mobility,
dressing, stairs, and bathing.
Final case ascertainment and diagnosis were performed
by a review panel consisting of 2 geriatricians (M.S.C. and
W.S.L.) and one psychiatrist (T.S.L.). These assessments were
based on all available information from baseline and fol-
low-up assessments, including brain magnetic resonance
imaging if available.
Diagnosis of MCI and Dementia
Mild cognitive impairment was defined according to pub-
lished criteria.36,37 These variables included the following:
(1) self-reported subjective memory and cognitive difficulties
and the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the
Elderly; (2) cognitive deficits in 1 or more domains, including
a modified MMSE score of 24 to 27, decline of 2 or more points
from baseline, and a neurocognitive domain (memory, execu-
tive function, language, visuospatial skills, or attention) score
that was 1 to 2 SDs below the age and education–adjusted
means or decline from baseline of 0.5 SD from serial measure-
ments); (3) Clinical Dementia Rating of 0 or 0.5; (4) no func-
tional dependency in performing basic activities of daily
living38; and (5) no dementia.
Dementia diagnosis was based on the Diagnostic and Sta-
tistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) criteria for
dementia syndrome,39 evidence of cognitive deficit from
objective assessment (MMSE score ≤23 or neuropsycho-
logical domain scores 2 SDs below the age and education–
adjusted means), and evidence of social or occupational func-
tion impairment (dependency in ≥1 basic activities of daily
living38 or Clinical Dementia Rating ≥1). Participants who did
not meet these criteria for MCI or dementia were classified as
cognitively normal.
Covariates
Covariates included age, sex, education (none, 1-5 years, or ≥6
years), APOE-ε4 (MIM 104310) genotype, smoking (current or
past smoking vs never smoking), and level of physical, social,
or productive activities. The latter were based on the number
and frequencies of usual participation in 18 different catego-
ries of physical, social, and productive activities.24
Statistical Analysis
The incidence rates of MCI and MCI progression to dementia
for groups with the MetS, component CVRFs, and 3 or more
componentCVRFswerecalculatedasthenumberofeventsper
1000 person-years at risk. Cox proportional hazards models
were used to model the time to new events of incident MCI or
MCI progression to dementia and to estimate hazard ratios
(HRs) and 95% CIs. Covariate adjustments were made for age
(in years), sex, education, APOE genotype (1-2 ε4 alleles vs no
ε4 allele), and physical, social, and productive activities score.
Covariateadjustmentdidnotincludecardiacdiseasesorstroke
because they were considered to be more likely mediators
rather than confounders. Individuals who did not develop the
outcome of interest, died, or were lost to follow-up were cen-
sored at the time of their last evaluation. The Cox propor-
tional hazards assumption was checked using a log vs log mi-
nus log plot. Effect modifications were explored in stratified
analyses performed for subgroups defined by sex, age, and
APOE-ε4 genotype. Data analysis was performed using statis-
tical software (SPSS, version 21.0; IBM Corporation). Statisti-
cal significance was set at P < .05.

Results
The demographics, risk factors, and MetS characteristics of the
cohort members are summarized in Table 1. Those with the
MetS compared with their non-MetS counterparts were older
and less educated; had lower levels of physical, social, and pro-
ductive activities; and reported more cardiac diseases but not
stroke. There were significantly more cases of incident MCI
from follow-up among those with the MetS (13.5% [46 of 340])
than among those without the MetS (8.1% [95 of 1179])
(P < .001).
The incidence rates, crude and adjusted HRs (95% CIs) of
MCI by the MetS, component CVRFs, and number of CVRFs are
summarized in Table 2. Significantly (1.5-fold to 3-fold) in-
creased risks of MCI were associated with the MetS, as well as
in those with diabetes mellitus, central obesity, dyslipid-
emia, and 3 or more component CVRFs (but not hyperten-
sion)comparedwiththeircounterparts.TheHRestimateswere
unchanged or modestly attenuated after adjustment for sex,
age, education, APOE-ε4 genotype, smoking, and physical, so-
cial, and productive activities score.
AmongcohortmemberswhohadMCIatbaseline(n = 425),
those with the MetS had lower levels of physical, social, and
productive activities and reported more cardiac diseases and
stroke (Table 3). There were significantly more cases of inci-
dentdementiaamongthosewiththeMetS(8of103[7.8%])than
among those without the MetS (6 of 322 [1.9%]) (P < .003).
The incidence rates and crude and adjusted HRs (95% CIs)
of MCI progression to dementia among those with MCI at base-
line by the MetS, component CVRFs, and number of CVRFs are
summarized in Table 4. Significantly increased risks of pro-
gression to dementia were associated with the MetS, 3 or more
component CVRFs (>4 fold), and diabetes mellitus (approxi-
mately ≥2 fold) compared with their counterparts. The risks
were also elevated (almost 2 fold) but with statistical non-
significance for those with central obesity, dyslipidemia, or hy-
pertension. The HR estimates were unchanged or modestly
attenuated after adjustment for confounding risk factors.
We repeated our analyses for stratified groups of partici-
pants younger than 75 years vs 75 years and older and found
that the MetS and component CVRFs were significantly and
positively associated with MCI only among the younger sub-
cohort.Nosignificantpositiveassociationwasobservedamong
those 75 years and older, with nonsignificance of statistical in-
teractions (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Stratified analyses and
tests of statistical interaction also did not reveal significant
effect modification by sex or APOE-ε4 genotype.
Discussion
This longitudinal analysis of a Chinese cohort of cognitively
normal older persons 55 years and older in Singapore showed
that the MetS, diabetes mellitus, central obesity, dyslipid-
emia, and the presence of 3 or more component CVRFs were
associated with a 1.5 to 2 times higher risk of developing
MCI. Among those with MCI at baseline, the risks of pro-
gression to dementia were more than 4 times greater among
those with the MetS or those with 3 or more component
CVRFs and more than 2 times greater among those with dia-
betes mellitus.
We assessed the MetS in a young aging cohort (mean age,
64.9 years) and observed them for up to 10 years (median, 3.8
years) to incident MCI and MCI progression to dementia. Our
finding that the MetS and component CVRFs were signifi-
cantly associated with MCI only among the younger subco-
hort, with no significant positive association observed among
those 75 years and older, suggests that the MetS-MCI relation-
ship was most evident before age 75 years.

a-MCI.21However,2prospectivecohortstudies22,23failedtofind
a convincing association between the MetS and the risk of in-
cident MCI. In one cohort study22 of postmenopausal women
(mean age, 66 years), the MetS was associated with incident
cognitive impairment but not with MCI per se. The Italian pro-
spective cohort study by Solfrizzi et al23 (mean age, 72 years)
reportednoassociationoftheMetSwithincidentMCIbutposi-
tively reported that the MetS was associated with a 4-fold
higher risk of MCI progression to dementia.
In this study, significantly increased risks of incident MCI
werefoundtobeassociatedwithdiabetesmellitus,centralobe-
sity, dyslipidemia, and 3 or more component CVRFs but not
withhypertension.Thisresultisinkeepingwiththestrongevi-
dence that diabetes mellitus throughout the life course is caus-
ally associated with dementia.2 Evidence is limited but con-
sistent in suggesting that central obesity in midlife but not late
life may be a risk factor for late-life dementia, but evidence for
bodymassindexisinconsistent.44-46Fordyslipidemia,thepub-
lished findings are inconsistent in supporting an association
with dementia.2,5 Hypertension in midlife has been shown to
be consistently strongly associated with incident dementia in
later life overall, particularly vascular dementia; however, in-
verseornoassociationsbetweenlate-lifehypertensionandde-
mentia are reported in cohort studies of older persons with
short follow-up.2
This study has important clinical and therapeutic impli-
cations. The predementia syndrome of MCI is widely re-
garded to be a critical new focus for early intervention. Many
potential antidementia treatments have been shown in clini-
cal trials to be ineffective for slowing cognitive decline asso-
ciated with advanced neuropathological disease. Early inter-
vention in patients with MCI represents a paradigmatic shift
in clinical trial interventions aimed at preventing or slowing
progression to dementia. There is already good and consis-
tent evidence that individuals with diabetes mellitus have a
higher prevalence of cognitive impairment and are at in-
creased risk of developing dementia. Identifying individuals
with diabetes mellitus or the MetS with or without MCI is a
promising approach in early interventions to prevent or slow
progression to dementia.
Thestudypopulationwasoptimallypoweredbyitssample
size and demographics to detect a significant association of the
MetS with incident MCI, with adjustment for important con-
founding risk factors. However, the number of cases of inci-
dent dementia was small. Therefore, the study lacks the power
to determine the risk of incident dementia associated with the
MetS.Amongthosewhowerefreeofdementiaatbaseline(cog-
nitively normal and MCI included), with only 26 cases of in-
cident dementia from 6654 person-years of follow-up, el-
evated but statistically nonsignificant risks of incident
dementia were associated with the MetS (adjusted HR, 1.37;
95% CI, 0.60-3.12; P = .49) and diabetes mellitus (adjusted
HR, 2.07; 95% CI, 0.78-5.50; P = .14) (eTable 2 in the Supple-
ment). The estimated excess risk of incident dementia was
concentrated in the cohort subset with MCI at baseline but,
based on a total of 14 cases with progression to dementia, was
surroundedbywide95%CIs.Therewerealsoinsufficientnum-
bers in subgroups to demonstrate statistically significant ef-

fectmodificationbyagegroupsandAPOE-ε4genotype.Among
cognitively normal individuals, there were 13 cases of demen-
tia that were diagnosed without prior detection of MCI status
during follow-up, suggesting less than optimal case detec-
tionofthiselusivepredementiacondition.Assumingthatthese
dementia cases were all undetected MCI cases, we reesti-
mated the HR of association with the MetS (see the first foot-
note to Table 2) and obtained similar results. Data permitting
the neurocognitive and etiological subtyping of MCI and de-
mentiawerenotavailableforabouthalfoftheparticipantswith
MCI or dementia who declined further in-person detailed ex-
aminations. Based on data for 17 a-MCI cases and 39 na-MCI
cases that were successfully classified, we found similarly el-
evated adjusted odds of association for the MetS with a-MCI
(HR, 1.41; P = .56) and na-MCI (HR, 1.42; P = .31) and for dia-
betes mellitus with a-MCI (HR, 1.83; P = .31) and na-MCI (HR,
1.68; P = 19).
Conclusions
The MetS was associated with an increased incidence of MCI
and progression to dementia. Identifying individuals with dia-
betes mellitus or the MetS with or without MCI is a promising
approach in early interventions to prevent or slow progres-
siontodementia.FurtherstudiesoftheassociationoftheMetS
with neurocognitive subtypes of MCI or etiological subtypes
of AD or vascular dementia are needed.
