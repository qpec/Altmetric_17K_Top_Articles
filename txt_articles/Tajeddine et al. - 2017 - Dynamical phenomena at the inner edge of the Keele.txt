Abstract 
 
We analyze several thousand Cassini ISS images in order to study the inner edge of 
the Keeler gap in Saturn‚Äôs outer A ring. We find strong evidence for an m=32 
perturbation with a mean amplitude of radial variation of 4.5 km. Phase analysis yields a 
pattern speed consistent with the mean motion of Prometheus, indicating that this pattern 
is generated by the 32:31 Inner Lindblad resonance with Prometheus. In addition, we find 
evidence of 18-lobed and 20-lobed patterns with amplitudes of ~1.5 km. These patterns, 
whose rotation rates correspond to resonance locations ~4 km interior to the gap edge, are 
believed to be normal modes. The former is probably related to the nearby 18:17 (m=18) 
resonance with Pandora. In addition to these resonant and normal mode patterns, we also 
observe multiple localized features that appear to move at the local keplerian rate and that 
persist for only a few months. One hypothesis is that different groups of ring particles at 
the inner edge of the gap may be reacting differently to the resonance with Prometheus, 
with local variations in the forced eccentricity and/or pericenter; an alternative hypothesis 
is the existence of several unseen objects embedded at or near the inner edge of the 
Keeler gap, similar to those suspected to exist at the outer edges of the A and B rings 
(Spitale and Porco 2009, 2010). In either case, observations of the ring edge at opposite 
ansae demonstrate that the localized features must be on eccentric orbits. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Among the many curious features that characterize the rings of Saturn is a ~37 km wide 
sharp-edged gap in the outer A ring known as the Keeler gap. In an early study of the 
Keeler gap using Voyager images, Cooke (1991) showed that the local gap width varied 
from ~35 to ~40 km, and that at least part of this variation could plausibly be attributed to 
perturbations by the Prometheus resonance, described below.  Cooke also found evidence 
for a shorter-wavelength perturbation, possibly a 50-lobed pattern. However, given the 
small number of Voyager images with sufficient resolution for such a study, Cooke 
(1991) was unable to derive a single, self-consistent model for the Keeler gap edges.  To 
date, no analysis of the long-wavelength variations in the edges of the Keeler gap using 
the much more extensive set of Cassini imaging data has been published. 
 
  Porco et al. (2005a) suggested, based on high-frequency radial perturbations seen at 
the gap edges, that a small satellite orbited within the gap, a prediction that was soon 
confirmed by additional Cassini images (Porco et al 2005b). This satellite, now known as 
Daphnis, is believed to maintain the gap via the same shepherding mechanism originally 
proposed to maintain the narrow uranian rings by Goldreich & Tremaine (1979).  
Torques exerted on the ring by the satellite prevent the gap edges from closing due to 
viscous spreading. In a visible manifestation of this process, as ring particles reach 
Daphnis‚Äô longitude, their orbits are gravitationally disturbed and they acquire free 
eccentricities and inclinations (the latter due to Daphnis‚Äô inclined orbit), which produce 
prominent radial and vertical wavy structures on both edges of the gap (see Fig. 1). These 
are discussed by Tiscareno et al. (2005), Weiss et al. (2009), and Torrey et al. (2010). 
Unlike the similar perturbations produced by the satellite Pan at the edges of the Encke 
Gap (Cuzzi & Scargle 1986), however, the wavy features on the Keeler gap edges damp 
quite rapidly, within few degrees in longitude.   
 
Another type of structure present only at the outer edge of the gap are small-scale (a 
few hundred-meters radially by ~1¬∞ in azimuth) features that extend radially into the gap 
from the outer edge (Porco et al. 2005). These so called ‚Äúwisps‚Äù orbit Saturn at the local 
Keplerian rate, and are believed to be due to local perturbations created by small objects 
embedded in the ring near the outer edge of the gap (Arnault & Tiscareno, 2016). Wisps 
appear to be unique to the outer edge of the Keeler gap. 
 
The inner edge of the gap (i.e., the edge closer to Saturn) is the subject of this paper. 
Its mean radius, based on fits to over 100 stellar and radio occultation profiles (French et 
al. 2017), is 136,484.8¬±0.3 km, and it coincides closely with the 32:31 Inner Lindblad 
Resonance (ILR) with Prometheus. The resonance location of 136482.4 km, is only ~2 
km interior to the edge of the gap. In general, the mean motion of a ring particle in a first-
order ILR with a satellite obeys the relation 
 
m ‚àí1
(
)n + !
œñ ‚àí mns = 0 ,

where, n and ns are the mean motions of the ring particle and satellite, respectively, m is 
the azimuthal wave number and ùúõ is the local apsidal precession rate due to Saturn‚Äôs 
gravity field (see Eq. 5 below). After m orbits such a ring particle will return to the same 
longitude relative to the satellite, at the same mean anomaly, while the latter would have 
orbited Saturn m-1 times. For higher-order resonances, ns is replaced by the pattern speed 
Œ©p, the angular rotation rate of the external perturbation. Eq. (1) also formally describes 
an Outer Lindblad Resonance (OLR) if we adopt the convention that m is negative for 
such resonances (Hedman et al., 2013). For an ILR, Œ©p < n whereas for an OLR, Œ©p > n.

From left to right are the Encke gap, the Keeler gap (with Daphnis in the middle causing 
the waves on the gap edges), and the outer edge of the A ring. The linear features in the 
ring are density and bending waves created by resonances with satellites exterior to the 
rings. 
 
At Lindblad resonances, perturbations from the satellite excite the ring particles‚Äô 
eccentricities. As a result, in the reference frame of the perturbing satellite, the ring edge 
develops an m-lobed pattern, representing the m apoapses and periapses that each ring 
particle goes through before returning to the same longitude it started from in the 
satellite‚Äôs frame. In the case of the inner edge of the Keeler gap, the satellite is 
Prometheus and m=32. The radius of the inner edge of the Keeler gap is thus expected to 
vary as a function of time and inertial longitude as

where a is the average radius of the ring edge, e is its eccentricity, Œª is the inertial 
longitude of the ring edge, Œ©p is the rotation rate of the m-lobed pattern (equal in this case 
to the mean motion of Prometheus ns), t is the elapsed time since our adopted epoch of 
J2000, Œª0 is the inertial longitude of Prometheus at t=0, and Œ¥ is a phase angle. 
Theoretically, Œ¥ should be either 0 or 180 degrees, meaning that either an apoapsis or a 
periapsis of the pattern, respectively, should be aligned with the satellite‚Äôs longitude. We 
follow here the notation of Nicholson et al. (2014a,b), except for the definition of the 
phase angle; in terms of their phase angle Œ¥m , we have Œ¥ = m(Œª0 ‚Äì Œ¥m). 
 
In this work we investigate phenomena at the inner edge of the Keeler gap by 
analyzing 58 FMOVIE mosaics based on several thousands of Cassini images taken 
between 2005 and 2014. In section 2 and 3 we describe the observations used in this 
work, and then present evidence of the anticipated m=32 perturbation at the inner edge of 
the gap. We also show that the resonant perturbation due to Prometheus is not the only 
distortion present, and in section 4 we present evidence for the presence of both m=18 
and m=20 normal modes at the gap edge. In section 5, we discuss additional perturbations 
at the inner edge of the Keeler gap that appear to be unrelated to the resonant and normal 
mode signatures. In section 6, we discuss the viscosity of the ring and the torques exerted 
on the gap edges. Our results are summarized and discussed in section 7. 
 
2. Analysis of FMOVIE mosaics 
 
Among the many different types of observations of the rings by Cassini ISS is a group 
known as FMOVIEs. These are sequences of a large number (a few tens to hundreds, see 
Table 1) of images that were specifically designed to track perturbations of Saturn‚Äôs F 
ring by Prometheus and various ring-embedded objects (Murray et al. 2005; 2008). 
Fortunately, the Keeler gap appears in most of those observations, a circumstance that 
allowed us to carry out this study. A typical FMOVIE has a duration of 10-15 hours, 
comparable to the 14.9-hour orbital period of the F ring and the 14.3-hour period of 
objects in or near the Keeler gap. 
 
Since it is impossible for Cassini to take a single, high-resolution, instantaneous 
snapshot of the whole F ring, multiple images must be put together to build mosaics of 
the ring. There are two types of FMOVIE observations. The most common are the 
‚ÄúStare‚Äù variety, where the ISS Narrow Angle Camera (NAC; Porco et al. 2004) is pointed 
towards one fixed inertial longitude and observes the ring particles passing through the 
camera‚Äôs frame as they orbit Saturn. This provides a good view of rotating patterns that 
shape the ring azimuthally, but is insensitive to any global eccentricity or inclination, 
since such patterns do not precess appreciably in the course of a single observation, and 
so do not cause any change in the observed radius of the ring. Therefore, if the ring edge 
had an eccentricity or an inclination, its mean radius would be constantly smaller or 
larger than the mean one depending on its orbital phase when the edge was observed; this 
does not affect our results here because here we are studying only high-frequency radial 
variations. A less frequent type of observation is one that follows one segment of the ring 
 as its particles orbit Saturn, intended to show how one particular group of ring particles 
traces out their eccentric orbits. In this study, we use only the first type.  
 
 
Cassini Image processing: methods 
 
 In order to analyze a Cassini image, some starting information is required. The label of 
every image contains the observation time, which allows us (with the help of the tools in 
the NAIF SPICE library: http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/; Acton 1996) to obtain information 
on the instantaneous position of the spacecraft and the pointing vector of the ISS NAC. 
The former is known to a precision of ~1 km, which is reflected as uncertainty of ~1km 
on the position of an observed object. The latter is less well known a priori: the projected 
error in an image is on the order of tens of pixels, yielding a typical error at the Keeler 
gap of 50-100 kilometers. The most common way to correct this error is with star 
astrometry  (Tajeddine et al. 2013; 2015; Cooper et al. 2014). However, this method 
cannot be employed for most of the images used in this study, as the rings cover a large 
proportion of the image, reducing the chance of detecting many stars and so correcting 
the errors in the camera pointing. Another method of pointing correction is to use a 
circular ring feature, such as the outer edge of the Keeler gap. The absence of any 
resonant perturbation (it still has minor perturbations such as Daphnis waves and wisps) 
makes it a circular edge, within the limit of Cassini ISS resolution, with a radius 
determined by occultation data of 136522.18¬±0.09 km (French et al. 2017). This edge can 
thus be used as a fiducial to correct the camera pointing (discussed further below). After 
testing both methods, we noticed that the pointing correction based on stellar astrometry 
created in some cases unaligned trends when building edge profile mosaics. The reason is 
that a pointing correction using catalogue stars does not make up for any error in the 
spacecraft position; but when using the outer edge of the Keeler gap both the camera 
pointing and spacecraft position are corrected. Therefore, we adopted the second method 
to navigate our Cassini images. 
 
To correct the pointing using the outer edge of the Keeler gap, we first locate the edge 
by calculating the derivative of the brightness curve as a function of pixel number along a 
line going from the dark gap to the bright ring (this is similar to the method used in 
satellite limb measurements; Tajeddine et al. 2013). By fitting a Gaussian function to the 
peak of the brightness derivative curve, we obtain the edge position with an uncertainty 
on the order of 0.1 pixels. The camera pointing for each image is then corrected by 
minimizing the distance between the measured edge and the predicted one projected on 
the image via SPICE geometry calculations. Once the camera pointing is corrected, we 
use the SPICE library to determine the ring radius and longitude coordinates for each 
image pixel.  
 
Finally, to build an edge mosaic of the Keeler gap, we must reproject the relevant 
portion of each image into (inertial longitude, radius) coordinates. We then measure the 
edge profile in the reprojected image, applying the same method used on the outer edge 
to correct the pointing as described above. The original inertial longitudes are then 
converted to co-rotating longitudes via the expression Œ∏=Œª-Œªs , where Œª is the measured 
 inertial longitude and Œªs is the instantaneous inertial longitude of a satellite, obtained from 
the SPICE ephemeris (if we built the mosaic in the inertial frame, all the images and edge 
profiles would be overlapping, because the Cassini camera usually stares at one inertial 
longitude during an FMOVIE sequence). The mosaic is then presented in radius and co-
rotating longitude (Œ∏) coordinates. 
 
3. The Prometheus Perturbation 
 
In Figure 2 we present a mosaic of the Keeler gap, made by assembling 130 NAC 
images from an FMOVIE obtained by Cassini ISS in 2013. This reprojected mosaic 
shows the radial distance from Saturn in kilometers as a function of longitude from 
Prometheus. As expected, the inner edge exhibits clear quasi-sinusoidal variations in 
radius, which form a somewhat irregular 32-lobed pattern in Prometheus‚Äô frame. The 
outer edge shows no evidence of any major perturbations in radius, but this is because we 
assumed it to be circular in order to navigate the images. 
 
 
Figure 2. A 360 degree mosaic of the Keeler gap (constructed in Prometheus‚Äô frame) 
made from observations taken by Cassini ISS on 21 August 2013, on its 196th orbit (see 
Table 1 for further details). The top panel shows the reprojected mosaic of actual images 
while the bottom panel shows the edge profiles extracted from the mosaic. The 
disturbances around -70¬∞ are the Daphnis waves, and the glitches at ~5¬∞ and ~50¬∞ are due 
to an error in the camera pointing correction for two images.  Numbered arrows highlight 
the 32-lobed pattern on the inner edge. The circles show some of the features that do not 
fit the dominant m=32 pattern. The brightness cut at ~ -135¬∞ (top panel) represents the 
beginning/end of an observations sequence, thus, the first and last image of the sequence

 are separated by ~15 h where the spacecraft has changed its viewing angle relative to the 
Sun and the rings, which explains the brightness difference. 
 
Although the m=32 pattern seems to be the dominant perturbation at the inner edge of 
the gap, as anticipated above, irregularities in this pattern raise the possibility of 
additional perturbations, resonant or otherwise.  Variations in the amplitude of the pattern 
suggest the possibility of beating with another periodic signal. We also draw the reader‚Äôs 
attention to the ‚Äúwiggles‚Äù at ‚àí163, ‚àí94.5, ‚àí3.5, +23 and +73.5¬∞, which do not seem to fit 
the dominant m=32 pattern. 
 
In order to investigate the nature of these irregularities, we have analyzed similar edge 
profiles obtained by Cassini ISS from a total of 58 MOVIEs between 2005 and 2014. 
These data sets are listed in Table 1, along with their durations, inertial longitudes, radial 
resolutions, and the number of images per movie. For each edge profile, we performed a 
Fourier analysis, treating the corotating longitude Œ∏ (this time in the local keplerian 
frame, with Œª0 + Œ©pt in Eq. (2) is replaced by n(t - t0) ) as the independent variable and 
radius as the dependent variable; the resulting spatial frequencies were converted to the 
equivalent value of m, representing the number of lobes per 360¬∞ of longitude in the 
corotating frame. 
 
Figure 3 shows the mean amplitude spectrum averaged over the individual spectra 
obtained from the Fourier transforms of the 58 edge profiles; the abscissa is labeled as  
|m-1| because any m-lobed resonant perturbations would appear with m-1 lobes in the 
local keplerian frame. We adopted this approach because, while a mosaic constructed in 
the reference frame of the perturbing satellite (such as that in Fig. 2) will show m lobes, 
each potential perturbation has its own unique pattern speed, given by Eq. (1).  Resonant 
perturbations due to another satellite, for example, would be associated with a different 
pattern speed and would thus not show an integer numbers of lobes in such a mosaic. It 
can be shown, however (see Eq. (9) of El Moutamid et al. 2016) that any perturbation 
which obeys Eq. (1) (ie., an inner or outer Lindblad resonance) will lead to a signature 
with |m-1| lobes if plotted in a frame rotating at the local keplerian rate, n. 
 
As expected from Fig. 2, the strongest signal in Fig. 3 is at |m-1| = 31 with a mean 
amplitude of about 4.5 km. This is consistent with an ILR-type perturbation with m=32. 
Weaker signals appear at |m-1| = 17 and 19, and are discussed in the next section. We do 
not find any evidence for a signature at m=50 as reported by Cooke (1991), based on a 
limited number of Voyager images. In hindsight, this signal could have been due to a 
chance observation of those parts of the ring where the dominant pattern consists of 
irregular high frequency features such as those seen around -95o or +23o in Fig. 2.

profiles extracted from the 58 mosaics of the inner edge of the Keeler gap listed in Table 
1. The spatial frequency has been converted to |m-1|, as the profiles were analyzed in the 
local keplerian frame (see text). 
 
To investigate whether this signal is indeed caused by the resonance with Prometheus, 
we performed a phase analysis by fitting Eq. (2) to the edge profiles measured in 
individual FMOVIE sequences. We set m=32 and the pattern speed to Œ©p=587.285¬∞/day, 
equal to the mean motion of Prometheus. (This value was obtained by averaging the 
mean motion derived from the numerically-integrated ephemeris provided in the SPICE 
software package during the period from 2004 to 2015. Note that it is slightly different 
from the value given by the JPL Horizons, website: http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi). 
Each image is associated with one observation time t, but up to a thousand edge points, 
each with their own inertial longitude Œª; from these we computethe model radius, rc(Œª,t) 
and minimize the œá2 statistic for each FMOVIE by fitting for the amplitude ae and the 
phase Œ¥ of the perturbation. We use a simple, unweighted measure given by

where the indices o and c represent the observed and calculated radii, respectively, and N 
is the total number of points used in the fit, which is on the order of 20,000 data points 
per FMOVIE.  
 
For individual FMOVIES, the fitted amplitudes range from 2.5 to 6 km, with an average 
value of 4.5 km. The fitted phases are shown in Fig. 4; each point represents a fit to a 
single FMOVIE. The phase varies between 150¬∞ and 190¬∞, with a mean value of 166¬∞ and 
a standard deviation of 14¬∞. The concentration of phases near 180¬∞ means that the m=32 
pattern is following Prometheus‚Äô motion with a pericenter that is nearly aligned in 
|m-1| 
Amplitude (km) 
 longitude with Prometheus. However, the pattern leads the satellite by an average of 14¬∞ 
(Note that this is the phase lag, as defined in Eq. (2). In order to convert this to a lag in 
longitude, it must by divided by m=32, implying a lag of Œî=0.4¬∞ in one of the minima in 
the pattern with respect to Prometheus‚Äô longitude). A similar lag was observed in the 
m=2 pattern at the edge of the B-ring, which is forced by the 2:1 inner Lindblad 
resonance with Mimas (Spitale & Porco 2010), and interpreted by these authors in terms 
of the ring‚Äôs effective viscosity ŒΩ. We will return to this possibility and its implications 
for torque balance at the gap edges in Section 6 below. 
 
Finally, we note that there appear to be small but systematic variations in the phase over 
the 9-year period of our observations, with Œ¥ increasing prior to 2010 and perhaps 
decreasing after 2012. Without a longer span of data, it is impossible to tell if this 
represents an oscillation (or libration) in Œ¥ about its long-term mean value or simply 
errors in the phase determinations, or maybe a long-period longitude variation in 
Prometheus‚Äô orbit.

Cassini was in a near-equatorial orbit in 2006 and 2010-12, resulting in the absence of 
ring observations in these periods. The dashed line represents the mean value of 166¬∞ ¬± 
14¬∞. 
 
4. Weaker perturbations 
 
As seen in the previous section, the average amplitude spectrum in Fig. 3 shows strong 
evidence for the effects of the 32:31 Prometheus ILR at the inner edge of the Keeler gap. 
However, this figure also shows two additional noteworthy peaks at |m-1| = 17 and 19, 
each of which has two possible interpretations. If they are due to inner Lindblad 
resonances with m=18 and m=20, then we might expect to find a nearby 18:17 and/or 
20:19 resonance with an exterior satellite. On the other hand, if they are due to outer 
 Lindblad resonances with m=‚àí16 or m=‚àí18, we must look for a 16:17 and/or 18:19 
resonance with an interior satellite, or perhaps with Saturn itself.  (For further discussion 
of this ambiguity, the reader is referred to Section 2 of El Moutamid et al. (2016).) 
 
In order to check these possibilities, we calculated the radii for all first-order satellite 
resonances in this region, using Eq. (1) and appropriate expressions for the mean motion 
n and the apsidal precession rate ùúõ (Nicholson & Porco, 1988; French et al., 1982, 
Borderies-Rappaport & Longaretti 1994):

where M, R, and Jn are the mass, equatorial radius and zonal gravity harmonics of Saturn, 
(Jacobson et al., 2006) and i and e are the inclination and eccentricity of the ring particle 
orbit, respectively. (The original formulae given by Nicholson et al. (1988) contain an 
additional term that includes perturbations from external satellites, but these are 
negligible here and have been ignored for the purpose of this study.) In these expressions 
the quantity a is the local mean (or epicyclic) radius, as defined by Borderies-Rappaport 
and  Longaretti (1994), rather than the osculating semi-major axis. 
 
We find that the closest resonance to the inner edge of the Keeler gap, besides the 
Prometheus 32:31 ILR, is the 18:17 ILR with Pandora located at 136,456.5 km, or ~28 
km interior to the gap‚Äôs inner edge. Inspection of stellar occultation profiles for this 
region shows a substantial density wave driven by this resonance that propagates as far as 
the gap edge before it is damped. This resonance is thus a prime candidate to explain the 
m=18 signature in Fig. 3.  
 
m=18 signature 
 
To test whether the 18:17 ILR with Pandora is indeed responsible for the observed 
signal at |m-1|=17 in Fig. 3 (perhaps via the intermediary of the density wave), we carried 
out a similar phase analysis to that done for the Prometheus resonance in the previous 
section. After first subtracting the best-fitting m=32 signal from each edge profile, we fit 
the amplitude ae and the phase Œ¥ in Eq. (2) to the residual perturbations, but this time 
setting m=18 and the pattern speed Œ©p equal to the mean motion of Pandora of 
572.790¬∞/day. In most cases we obtain a reasonable fit with an average amplitude ae ~1.3 
km as suggested by the spectrum in Fig. 3. However, the fitted phases are not constant, 
but show a systematically increasing trend, as shown in Fig. 5. (Here, we have 
‚Äòunwrapped‚Äô the fitted phases to make the trend more obvious to the eye.) Usually, such a 
linear trend in phase signifies that the assumed pattern speed is incorrect, with the fitted 
phases making up for the error. Despite this problem, the tight grouping of the fitted

The slope of the trend line in Fig. 5 suggests a correction to the assumed pattern speed 
of ‚àí0.155¬∞/day (the slope must be divided by 18, and the sign is reversed because of the 
way we define the phase in Eq. (2), so that the correction is negative). Such a correction 
is much larger than the maximum variations in the mean motion of Pandora, which are of 
order 0.03¬∞/day as seen in its numerically-integrated orbit. But the proximity of the 
density wave to the gap edge suggests an alternative model.  If instead of using the mean 
motion of Pandora, we adopt the corrected pattern speed of Œ©p=572.639¬∞/day and 
recalculate the resonant radius using Eqns. (1, 4, and 5), then we obtain a resonant radius 
of 136,480.2 km, which is only ~4 km interior to the gap edge. 
 
This suggests that the m=18 perturbation may instead be a normal mode at the gap‚Äôs 
inner edge, similar to those reported by Nicholson et al. (2014b) and French et al. (2016) 
on numerous gap and ringlet edges in the C ring and Cassini Division. Such modes are 
essentially a free instability at a sharp ring edge, and can be thought of in terms of a pair 
of inward- and outward-propagating density waves trapped between a virtual Lindblad 
resonance and the gap (or ringlet) edge. Spitale and Porco (2010) have referred to this 
phenomenon as a ‚Äòresonant cavity‚Äô, which seems an apt analogy. At an inner gap edge, 
only ILR-type modes are expected (cf. discussion in Section 2 of Nicholson et al. 2014b), 
such as we see here. But why an m=18 mode, rather than any other m-value? In this case, 
we hypothesize that the m=18 mode is triggered by the radial disturbance associated with 
the Pandora 18:17 density wave, whose pattern speed differs only slightly from the local 
frequency of a free m=18 mode.

by eye to produce a monotonic sequence. (Bottom panel) A plot of the corrected phases

m=20 signature 
 
Unlike the m=18 perturbation, we have not identified any external source for a 20:19 
ILR in the vicinity of the Keeler gap.  Such a hypothetical satellite would be located 
between Pandora and the F ring, and would surely have been discovered already. And a 
satellite responsible for an 18:19 OLR ‚Äì which could also lead to a signature with |m-1| = 
19 ‚Äì would be located in the inner A ring, a hypothesis we can also safely rule out.  So 
again we turn to the possibility of an ILR-type normal mode, this time with m=20. 
 
We use Eq. (1) to calculate the pattern speed ns=Œ©p, corresponding to such a mode, 
using the local mean motion n and apsidal precession rate ùúõ calculated from Eqns. (4) 
and (5), respectively. We find a pattern speed for m=20 at the inner edge of the Keeler 
gap of 575.961¬∞/day. Using this pattern speed and m=20, we fit the residual perturbations 
in each edge mosaic by adjusting the amplitude ae and phase Œ¥ in Eq. (2). Again the fits 
are mostly quite reasonable, with average amplitudes ae ~1.7 km, consistent with the 
spectrum in Fig. 3. Figure 6 shows the fitted phases, which in this case show a slow 
negative drift over time. The mean slope suggests a correction to the assumed pattern 
speed of +0.027¬∞/day (see previous section for the positive sign), resulting in a corrected 
pattern speed of 575.988¬∞/day. Once again, the small scatter about the linear drift in the 
phases strongly suggests that the signal is real. Using the corrected pattern speed with 
m=20, we calculate the resonant radius using Eqns. (1, 4, and 5), again obtaining a radius 
 of 136480.5 km, essentially the same as that of the m=18 mode. In this case, we can think 
of no particular reason that an m=20 normal mode might be excited. 
 
It is also unclear why the m=20 normal mode should have almost the same resonant 
radius as that of the m=18 mode, but the similarity in m-values does imply that the 
resonant cavity widths should be quite similar (Nicholson et al. 2014a), so perhaps this is 
not surprising.

edge of the Keeler gap, assuming m=20 and a pattern speed equal to 575.961¬∞/day, and

by eye to produce a monotonic sequence. (Bottom panel) A plot of the corrected phases 
after taking out the slope. 
  
Figure 3 shows the possibility of existence of two additional patterns at |m ‚Äì 1| = 26 and 
28. However, phase analysis for those two m numbers did not reveal any consistency 
between the phase fits from different movies; those features are most likely not real 
signals and may instead be due to aliasing from the |m ‚Äì 1| = 31, 19, and 17 signals. 
 
5. Other Phenomena 
 
We turn now to the small-scale irregularities, or ‚Äúwiggles‚Äù, in the dominant m=32 
pattern, such as those seen at ‚àí163, ‚àí94.5, ‚àí3.5, +23 and +73.5
Œø in Fig. 2. Such features 
were first noted by Tiscareno et al. (2005), but without explanation. In their analysis of 
the edge of the B-ring, Spitale and Porco (2010) noticed similar irregularities in addition 
to the resonant perturbation due to the 2:1 ILR with Mimas and several normal modes. 
They interpreted these irregularities as being due to embedded objects orbiting near the 
edge of the ring and causing local distortions in the distribution of ring particle 
streamlines, analogous to the ‚Äòpropellers‚Äô seen within the outer A ring (Tiscareno et al. 
2006; 2008; Sremƒçeviƒá et al. 2007) or to the disturbance caused by the object unofficially 
named ‚ÄòPeggy‚Äô at the outer edge of the A ring (Murray et al. 2014). A key argument in 
favor of this model was that the irregularities were observed to move through the 
resonant patterns at the local keplerian mean motion. 
 
An ideal opportunity to test such a model for the high-frequency wiggles on the edge of 
the Keeler gap is provided by four sets of observations obtained by Cassini on rev 196, 
over a period of 1 week in August 2013 (listed as 196_3, 196_4, 196_5, and 196_6 in 
Table 1). The first of these observations is that illustrated in Fig. 2; the other three 
followed at intervals of 3.5, 2.0 and 1.9 days, respectively. In Figure 7 we compare 
profiles extracted from all four of these FMOVIEs, generated in a reference frame 
moving with the mean motion of Prometheus (i.e., Œ©p = ns).  Although the m=32 pattern 
generally aligns from one observation to the next, the small-scale irregularities or 
deviations from this pattern clearly do not. However, closer inspection shows that the 
same features can be seen in each mosaic but that they drift systematically in longitude 
relative to Prometheus. For example, the sharp extra minimum at -94.5o in the first 
mosaic appears at -38o in the second, at +7o in the third and at +41o in the fourth.  Over a 
period of 7.4 days this feature moves by +135.5o, or an average of 18.3 ¬∞/day; noting that 
the difference between the local keplerian rate of n= 606.116¬∞/day and that of 
Prometheus is 18.69 ¬∞/day, we see that the offsets are approximately what would be 
expected for a feature moving at the local keplerian rate.  
 
We can test this hypothesis by redoing the mosaics in the local keplerian frame, as shown 
in Fig. 8 (i.e., the longitudes are now measured relative to an arbitrary ring particle 
moving at the keplerian rate). An astonishingly good alignment appears in this figure, 
despite the fact that the ring particles have orbited Saturn more than 12 times during this 
period. Indeed, it appears from this example that almost all the small-scale structures in 
the edge profile are moving at the local keplerian rate. Note that this does not mean that 
the m=32 pattern itself is moving at the local Keplerian rate; on the contrary it clearly 
follows the mean motion of Prometheus, as shown in Section 2. But all the additional 
 perturbations (that give each lobe its own distinctive shape) are moving at the keplerian 
rate. Thus, during each orbit around Saturn, these small-scale features move from one 
lobe in the m=32 pattern to the next. For example, the feature at -94.5o in the first mosaic 
in Fig. 7 moves ahead by five lobes in the second, by another four lobes in the third and 
by three more in the fourth, for a total of 12 lobes or 135o in longitude relative to the 
underlying m=32 pattern. The predicted shifts, given the intervals between the start times 
of the four observations, are 5.9, 3.4 and 3.2 lobes, respectively. (The actual shifts, noted 
above, differ slightly because the four movies began at different locations in the m=32 
pattern. Close inspection of Fig. 7 will reveal the overlap region in each profile.) 
 
In addition to the feature mentioned above, which we label as feature ‚Äòb‚Äô in Fig. 8, similar 
but less extreme examples are labeled as ‚Äòa‚Äô, ‚Äòc‚Äô, ‚Äòd‚Äô and ‚Äòe‚Äô. In most cases these take the 
form of `extra minima‚Äô between the resonant lobes, but feature ‚Äòd‚Äô is more complex and 
seems to involve two expected minima being split into four weaker minima. More careful 
scrutiny reveals that many of the other 32 minima are somewhat irregularly spaced, with 
spacings varying from as little as 8.5o to as much as 14o.

circled one) move at the local Keplerian rate (see text).

 It might reasonably be asked if all pairs of nearby observations would be expected to 
match as closely as those in Fig. 8. The answer is ‚Äúno‚Äù, for two reasons.  Firstly, all four 
FMOVIEs in Figs 7 and 8 were targeted at almost the same inertial longitude Œª, within a 
range of 239 to 285o.  As shown by El Moutamid et al. (2016), an m-lobed resonant 
perturbation with pattern speed Œ©p, if viewed in the local keplerian frame, is described by 
the approximate expression

where  Œ∏ = Œª ‚Äì n (t-t0), Œª is the inertial longitude of the measurements and Œ¥ is the phase 
as defined in Eq. (2) above.  This implies not only that the pattern has m-1 lobes in the 
local keplerian frame, as noted in Section 2 above, but also that the phase of the pattern 
depends on Œª as well as Œ¥. Only when Œª is similar for two mosaics can we expect to see 
similar phases for the resonant patterns in the local keplerian frame. (Another way to 
express this is to require that the two observations of a given ring segment be separated 
by an integral number of orbits.) The second limitation is imposed by apsidal precession.  
After more than a few weeks, the pericenters associated with any free eccentricity (ie., 
those not forced by the satellite resonance) will have precessed significantly, After one-
half of the apsidal precession period (or ~60 days at the Keeler gap), what was initially a 
minimum in radius will appear as a maximum at the same inertial longitude, and the sign 
of the small-scale perturbations will be reversed. 
 
In order to better understand what is going on here, it is useful to keep in mind four 
distinct dynamical time scales. First is the local keplerian orbital period, Porb = 14.3 hr. 
Second is the time it takes a ring particle at the inner edge of the Keeler gap to gain one 
‚Äòlap‚Äô on Prometheus, i.e, the synodic period Psyn = 19.26 day.  In this time, the ring 
particle completes 32 orbits of Saturn and moves through all 32 lobes in the resonant 
pattern, each minimum corresponding to a pericenter passage in its saturnicentric orbit. 
(In this same period, of course, Prometheus completes 31 orbits around the planet.) Third  
is the local apsidal precession period, Papse = 2œÄ/ùúõ = 120 day. Fourth is the synodic 
period of the ring particle relative to the satellite Daphnis, whose mean motion is 605.98 
¬∞/day, or Penc ~ 7.5 yr. This is the interval between successive close encounters with the 
nearest massive body, at which time one would expect any free eccentricity to be reset if 
it has not already been damped by collisions.  The set of observations in Figs. 7 and 8 
span a period which is < Psyn and << Papse or Penc.  We thus expect to see minimal effects 
due to precession and no intervening Daphnis encounters. (Daphnis falls near -70o 
longitude in Fig. 8, as may be seen from the enhanced `noise‚Äô in our measured edge radii 
in this vicinity.)   
 
At least two possible explanations seem possible for the persistent small-scale structure 
in Figs. 7 and 8. One is that there are relatively-large objects embedded in the ring, which 
orbit at the local keplerian rate and ‚Äúcarry with them‚Äù local radial distortions in the ring 
streamlines, at least until the next encounter with Daphnis.  The second is that some 
groups of ring particles have slightly different eccentricities and/or pericenter longitudes 
than are predicted to arise from the 32:31 resonance with Prometheus and from the 
normal modes identified above. In the former case, a positive radial perturbation might be 
 expected to remain positive at all longitudes, while in the latter case a minimum in radius 
will become a maximum one-half an orbit later.  
 
We test these predictions using another set of mosaics made from observations with a 
different kind of geometry. As described in Section 1, FMOVIE mosaics usually involve 
the camera staring at a fixed inertial longitude and letting the ring particles pass through 
the camera‚Äôs field of view. This was the case for the mosaics in Fig. 7 and 8. But in 
several instances, such as on revs 29, 173, 177, 183 198, 201 and 203, Cassini stared at 
one ring ansa (ie., at a fixed inertial longitude) for approximately half an orbital period, 
and then observed the same ring particles on the opposite ansa (~180¬∞ away in inertial 
longitude). Figure 9 shows edge profile mosaics for such an observation in September 
2006, on rev 29. Here we see that the bottom profile (from movie 029a in Table 1) is 
almost the reverse of the middle profile (from movie 029b in Table 1). This is exactly 
what is expected for the m=32 resonant perturbation, since it forces the eccentricities and 
pericenters of ring particles rather than their semimajor axes: if a ring particle is at 
periapse at one ansa of the ring, it will be at apoapse 180¬∞ later. However, in Fig. 9 we 
see that this phenomenon also applies to the additional, small-scale perturbations. As the 
top profile in Fig. 9 shows, when we overlay the reverse of the middle profile (in red) 
over the bottom one (in black) the agreement is almost perfect. Clearly virtually all the 
patterns in both profiles are anti-aligned one-half an orbit later. This strongly suggests 
that most of the small-scale features are also due to eccentricity and/or pericenter 
variations, rather than to persistent radial perturbations such as an embedded object might 
produce. (An exception is the region between 130¬∞ and 140¬∞ where an embedded object 
is a possibility.) We have examined several such pairs of observations and in every case 
we find the same situation as in Fig. 9: clear evidence for eccentricity and/or pericenter 
variations but very little sign of persistent radial perturbations. 
  
 
 
Figure 9. Mosaics of edge profiles obtained in September 2006, or rev 29 (see Table 1). 
The bottom profile was made when Cassini observed an inertial longitude of 266¬∞ as the 
ring particles passed through its field of view. The middle plot was made 23 hrs later, 
with Cassini observing the ring at an inertial longitude of 84¬∞, as the same ring particles 
passed through the opposite ansa. The top profile is an overlay of the bottom and the 
reverse of the middle ones. The longitudes are measured relative to an arbitrary ring 
particle orbiting at the local keplerian rate. 
 
What might be responsible for such azimuthal variations in the resonantly-forced 
eccentricity and/or pericenter?  One possibility is that periodic encounters with Daphnis 
are able to perturb the eccentricities of ring particles. In this situation, the ring particles 
 gain free eccentricities after encountering the satellite that damp several orbits later. (The 
visible manifestation of this is the wavy edges of the gap seen within a few degrees 
downstream from the satellite; see Fig. 1 for examples).  A second possibility is also 
related to encounters with Daphnis, but in this case we focus on the much smaller 
perturbations in semi-major axis (which are second-order in the satellite-to-planet mass 
ratio; Dermott 1984).  Over time, this will lead to some ring particles moving slightly 
forward relative to their slower companions ahead or behind them in longitude. As a 
result, initially sinusoidal variations in radius due to the 32:31 resonance can become 
asymmetric, and their wavelength reduced or increased locally, as we see in Figs. 7 and 
8. However, it seems unlikely that this second process can lead to additional minima or 
maxima, such as those also seen in the same figures. Yet another possibility is that ring 
embedded objects on eccentric orbits near the inner edge of the Keeler gap could produce 
the observed localized features; the plausibility of this idea could be tested via 
simulations of interactions between such an eccentric embedded objects with the ring 
edge in order to verify if the perturbation reverses when the object is at periapse. 
 
We have attempted to track these irregular features in all the available FMOVIEs, which 
span more then nine years in total. In Figure 10 we show a set of edge profiles for the 
inner edge of the Keeler gap, generated in the local keplerian frame as in Fig. 8, obtained 
between 2012 and 2015. Many features can be tracked here but we focus on four. Note 
that some of these features appear to be shaped differently, or even reversed in sign, 
compared to neighboring mosaics. This can happen for two reasons: firstly because 
Cassini observed the ring at different inertial longitudes in the two observations, so that 
the ring particles have moved to a different orbital phase (or that the pattern is reversed 
on the opposite ansa as in Fig. 9). The second reason is the secular apsidal precession of 
particle orbits noted above; even if Cassini always observed the same inertial longitude, 
precession will slowly move this from periapse to apoapse at a rate of ~2.97¬∞/day. In 
either case, this is consistent with most of these irregularities being due to 
eccentricity/pericenter perturbations rather than to changes in semimajor axis.  
 
We see from Fig. 10 that these small-scale features typically survive for up to a year 
before they are damped out. If such perturbations were related to embedded objects, this 
could mean that the objects are disrupted or change their orbits. (Tracking features for 
longer periods is frustrated by the fact that Cassini spent most of 2005 and 2006, as well 
as all of 2010 and 2011, in equatorial orbits, where ring observations were impossible.) 
We also note that the feature labeled A in Fig. 10 appears to have survived an encounter 
with Daphnis in about July 2013, suggesting that encounters with this nearby satellite do 
not erase or reset the perturbations. None of the other labeled features encountered 
Daphnis during the period of intensive Cassini observations in 2012 - 2014 (recall that 
Penc ~ 7.5 yrs). Similar comparisons of mosaics obtained in 2006/7 and in 2008/9 show 
further examples of persistent small-scale structures, but the observations are less 
extensive than those in Fig. 10.

 6. Phase lag and torques 
 
By analogy with the Mimas 2:1 ILR at the outer edge of the B ring and the Janus 7:6 
ILR at the outer edge of the A ring (Spitale & Porco 2009, Spitale & Porco 2010, El 
Moutamid et al. 2016), one might expect that the Prometheus 32:31 ILR is responsible 
for confining the inner edge of the Keeler Gap. In such a situation, the torque Tr exerted 
on the ring by the resonance should balance the viscous torque Tv, due to the radial 
transport of angular momentum through the ring. As shown by Borderies et al. (1982), 
the resonant torque is proportional to a phase lag in the ring‚Äôs response, as well as to the 
square of the satellite‚Äôs mass, while the viscous torque is proportional to the ring‚Äôs 
effective kinematic viscosity ŒΩ, leading to the following approximate relation: 
 
 
 
 
(7) 
 
where Mp and Ms are the masses of the planet (Saturn) and the perturbing satellite 
(Prometheus), and n is the mean motion of a ring particle at the edge of the gap (given by 
Eq. 4). In terms of our notation, mŒî = Œ¥ - œÄ, which we found in Section 2 to be 
approximately -14¬∞, albeit with considerable scatter. (A similar lag was observed in the 
m=2 pattern at the edge of the B-ring by Spitale & Porco (2010), and interpreted by these 
authors in terms of the B ring‚Äôs effective viscosity ŒΩ.) 
 
  However, applying Eq. (7) to the inner edge of the Keeler gap, we obtain a very small 
viscosity of ŒΩ ‚âà 0.44 cm2/s. This number is almost three orders of magnitude lower than 
the viscosity of ~200 cm2/s obtained from an analysis of the damping of density waves in 
nearby regions (Tiscareno et al. 2007). In fact, no solution of this equation is possible for 
a viscosity comparable to that obtained by Tiscareno et al. (2007). 
 
Indeed, the torque from the 32:31 resonance with Prometheus is not the only torque 
acting to hold the Keeler gap open; Daphnis is expected to exert a shepherding torque on 
both edges that prevents them from viscously spreading and eventually closing the gap. 
We must therefore balance the viscous torque at the inner edge of the gap with the sum of 
the resonant torque from Prometheus and the shepherding torque from Daphnis. The 
three torques involved may be expressed as follows: 
 
the resonant torque (Borderies et al. 1982): 
, 
 
 
(8) 
the shepherding torque (Goldreich & Tremaine, 1982): 
, 
 
 
(9) 
and finally the viscous torque (Borderies et al. 1984): 
 
,

where the Œ£ and ŒΩ are the mean surface density and viscosity of the ring, respectively, and 
ae is the radial amplitude of the perturbed edge, Œîa = ae and as ‚Äì a is the radial 
separation between Daphnis and the mean ring edge. The mass Ms in Eq. (9) represents 
that of Daphnis since it is the shepherding satellite. Using a mass of Daphnis of 6.8 √ó 1013 
kg (Weiss et al., 2009, measured from the amplitude of the waves produced by Daphnis 
on the gap edges), and a surface density of 15 g/cm2 (Tiscareno & Harris 2015, 2017), we 
estimate the sizes of these torques to be Tv = 6.5 √ó 1013 Nm (if we use a ring viscosity of 
200 cm2/s; Tiscareno et al. 2007), Ts = 2.98 √ó 1012 Nm, and Tr = 5.9 √ó 1011 Nm.  
 
Since the resonant torque is almost two orders of magnitude weaker than the shepherding 
torque, we conclude that, regardless of the large uncertainty in the mean phase lag, the 
shepherding effect of Daphnis must dominate the maintenance of the edge, while the 
resonance with Prometheus plays a much smaller role. 
 
Furthermore, the nominal viscous torque is much larger than the resonant and the 
shepherding torques put together, by a factor of almost 20.  Assuming that the edge is not 
in fact governed by an unknown effect that is even larger than those under consideration, 
the simplest solution is to adjust the viscosity that enters into Equation 10.  By balancing 
all three torques acting on the inner edge of the Keeler gap, Tv = Ts + Tr, we obtain an 
effective viscosity of ŒΩ ‚âà 11 cm2/s, more than an order of magnitude less than that 
inferred from density waves in the outer A ring (Tiscareno et al. 2007). We believe this 
result is an instructive warning against assuming that a viscosity calculated from one 
process can necessarily be applied to another process.  Like the ‚ÄúŒ±-parameter‚Äù in 
protoplanetary disk models, the viscosity is useful in calculations as a stand-in for more 
complex physics and can mean different things in different contexts. Although both 
processes no doubt have the similarity of being characterized by friction among ring 
particles, there is no reason to presume that the damping of spiral density waves and the 
spreading of a ring at its edges are identical processes in all particulars.  Thus, we suggest 
that the value calculated here of ŒΩ ‚âà 11 cm2/s be taken alongside the value of ŒΩ ‚âà 200 
cm2/s calculated by Tiscareno et al. (2007) as a basis for further work in understanding 
the details of dissipative ring processes. 
 
7. Conclusion  
 
Mosaics of the inner edge of the Keeler gap reveal a complex structure indicative of 
multiple dynamical phenomena. After processing several tens of thousands of Cassini 
images, grouped into 58 distinct FMOVIE observations, we find consistent evidence of a 
32-lobed resonant perturbation with a mean amplitude of ~4.5 km. Phase analysis 
confirms that this pattern is following Prometheus‚Äô mean motion, with a small phase lag, 
and is thus almost certainly caused by the 32:31 inner Lindblad resonance with that 
satellite.  
 
However, irregularities in the m=32 pattern suggest the presence of additional 
perturbations. Fourier analysis provides evidence for two additional long-wavelength 
perturbations, with m=18 and m=20. The former might be associated with the 18:17 inner 
 Lindblad resonance with Pandora, although the resonant radius is ~28 km interior to the 
ring edge. However, the best-fitting pattern speed is 0.155¬∞/day slower than the mean 
motion of Pandora, suggesting a normal mode with a resonant radius which is only ~4 km 
interior to the ring edge. We hypothesize that the density wave driven by the 18:17 
resonance indirectly excites the normal mode near the edge of the gap.  The m=20 
pattern, on the other hand, does not seem to be related to any satellite resonance, but is 
also consistent with a normal mode excited at the gap edge. Curiously, the resonant 
radius is the same as that of the m=18 mode. Both m=18 and m=20 perturbations have 
amplitudes of ~1-2 km. 
 
In addition to the resonant and normal mode perturbations, we see several singular, 
small-scale features that appear to be orbiting Saturn at the local Keplerian rate. At any 
given time, 4 or 5 such features seem to be present on the ring edge, and to persist for 
periods of up to a year. Using observations which combine data from two opposite ring 
ansae, or inertial longitudes which differ by ~180o, we conclude that almost all of these 
features represent local eccentricity and/or pericenter perturbations rather than persistent 
radial distortions. Embedded objects at the ring edge could be the origin of those features, 
as proposed for similar features seen at the B ring‚Äôs outer edge by Spitale and Porco 
(2010). An alternative hypothesis is that ring particles in different segments of the ring 
edge react slightly differently to the resonant perturbations from Prometheus, resulting in 
local variations in the forced eccentricities and/or pericenter longitudes. Equivalently, we 
may say that these regions develop small free eccentricities, which add to the global 
forced eccentricity due to the resonance. A similar free m=2 mode is observed at the edge 
of the B ring, of amplitude comparable to the resonantly-forced perturbation due to 
Mimas, but this appears to be global free mode rather than several local perturbations 
(Spitale & Porco 2010, Nicholson et al. 2014a). 
 
Similar small-scale features appear at the outer edge of the A ring (Spitale & Porco 
2009, El Moutamid et al. 2016), as well as that of the B ring (Spitale & Porco 2010, 
Nicholson et al. 2014a). We would encourage future examinations of paired observations 
of these edges obtained at opposite ring ansae, where available, in order to ascertain if 
these features also represent eccentricity/pericenter variations.
