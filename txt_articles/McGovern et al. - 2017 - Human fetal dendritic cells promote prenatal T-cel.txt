During gestation the developing human fetus is exposed to a diverse range of 
potentially immune-stimulatory molecules including semi-allogeneic antigens from 
maternal cells1,2, substances from ingested amniotic fluid3,4, food antigens5 and microbes6. 
Yet the capacity of the fetal immune system, including antigen presenting cells (APC), to 
detect and respond to such stimuli remains unclear. In particular, dendritic cells (DC), 
which are crucial for effective immunity and tolerance, remain poorly characterized in 
  
3 
the developing fetus. Here, we show that APC subsets can be identified in fetal tissues and 
are related to adult APC populations. Similar to adult DC, fetal DC migrate to lymph 
nodes and respond to TLR ligation; however, they differ markedly in their response to 
allogeneic antigens, strongly promoting regulatory T cell (Treg) induction and inhibiting 
T cell TNF-a production through arginase-2 activity. Our results reveal a previously 
unappreciated role of DC within the developing fetus and indicate that fetal DC mediate 
homeostatic immune suppressive responses during gestation. 
 
 
We employed a combination of flow cytometry and gene array analysis to characterize 
human fetal APC and compare them with adult APC. Using our previously-described gating 
strategy for adult tissue APC7,8 (Extended Data Fig. 1a, b), we identified fetal APC subsets: 
CD14+ monocytes/macrophages, pDC, cDC1 and cDC2 within fetal spleen, skin (in agreement 
with findings from others9), thymus and lung (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1a) by 13 weeks 
(wk) estimated gestational age (EGA). Within both early (12-15wk) and late (16-22wk) 2nd 
trimester fetal tissues, APC were relatively abundant within the CD45+ compartment in 
comparison with equivalent adult tissues (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. 1c). Fetal spleen cDC1 
and cDC2 were also observed in situ using immunofluorescence microscopy (Extended Data 
Fig. 1d). Next we compared the gene expression profiles of cDC1, cDC2 and CD14+ cells 
purified by FACS from fetal skin and spleen with those from adult spleen (for sort gating 
strategy see Extended Data Fig. 1a, b and post-sort cell purity confirmation Extended Data 
Fig. 2a) as well as with published data on adult blood- and skin- derived APC subsets 
(Supplemental Experimental Procedures, Extended Data Fig. 3 and7). Connectivity map 
(CMAP) analysis7 was performed to compare the subset-specific gene expression signatures of 
fetal spleen and skin cDC1, cDC2 and CD14+ cells with adult blood, skin and spleen APC (Fig. 
1c). CMAP scores indicated that gene expression signature of fetal cDC1 was enriched with 
genes also expressed by adult cDC1; similarly, the fetal cDC2 signature was enriched with 
adult cDC2-associated genes and fetal CD14+ cells scored most highly with adult blood 
monocyte and tissue macrophage populations, as expected7,8. Scatter plot analysis of 
normalized gene expression confirmed the strong correlation (R score 0.92) between the 
expression profiles of fetal and adult cDC1, as well as fetal and adult cDC2 (Extended Data 
Fig. 2b). Conserved gene lists across fetal and adult APC subsets and Ingenuity Pathway 
Analysis (IPA) of these gene lists are provided in SI Tables 1 - 9 (See Supplementary 
Experimental Procedures for the analysis). At the molecular level, fetal and adult DC 
  
4 
expressed comparable levels of DC subset-specific transcription factors such as IRF8, IRF4, 
BATF3 and CADM1 (Extended Data Fig. 2c), in agreement with published data10. Detailed 
phenotyping of fetal and adult spleen DC by CyTOF and OneSense analysis (see 
Supplemental Experimental Procedures and11) demonstrated that fetal and adult spleen DC 
had similar antigen expression profiles, except for CD141, FceR1 and CLA which were 
relatively more highly expressed on adult cDC2 (Extended Data Fig. 4a, b).  
 
To gain insight into the functions and heterogeneity of the fetal tissue cDC populations, 
we first compared their surface antigen expression profiles across tissues within single donors 
(Fig. 2a, input gating strategy and original heatmap in Extended Data Fig. 5a, b), and with 
cDC from adult tissues using CyTOF and OneSense analysis11 (Extended Data Fig. 5c). Fetal 
cDC1 and cDC2 showed great heterogeneity between tissues at the single cell level (Fig. 2a), 
most obviously within the lung, suggesting differential tissue imprinting. We also identified 
tissue-specific cDC phenotypes conserved between adults and fetuses (Extended Data Fig. 
5c).  For example, both fetal and adult lung cDC2 expressed elevated levels of CD2 and FceR1, 
while expression of these markers by fetal and adult gut cDC were low to negative. Notably, 
the fetal lung cDC2 population exhibited heterogeneous expression of the transcription factor 
IRF4 (Extended Data Fig. 5d), which indicates contamination of the gated population with 
monocytes and/or monocyte-derived cells, as seen in adults12. Several activation markers were 
differentially expressed between cDC from different fetal tissues. In particular, fetal gut cDC 
displayed a more activated phenotype than did cDC in others fetal tissues (Fig. 2 a and 
Extended Data Fig. 5b, c), expressing higher levels of the chemokine receptor CCR7 and the 
activation markers CD80 and CD86. As CCR7 mediates DC migration to lymph nodes in 
adults, where they initiate and shape emergent T cell responses8,13, we then asked whether 
CCR7+ gut DC migrated to their draining lymphoid organs during fetal life. Using a gating 
strategy verified in adult tissues7, we identified migratory (HLA-DRhiCD11clo/int) and resident 
(HLA-DRintCD11chi) DC in 16wk EGA fetal mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) (Fig. 2b). In 
contrast, in the fetal appendix and tonsil, which lack connecting afferent lymphatics, we 
observed only resident DC (Fig. 2b). Within the MLN, the resident cell population included 
CD14+ cells, cDC1 (CD26+CD1c-) and cDC2 (CD26-CD1c+) (Extended Data Fig. 6a). The 
migratory-phenotype fraction of DC within the MLN contained relatively few CD14+ cells, as 
in adults7,8, alongside both cDC1 and cDC2, with the former relatively more abundant 
(Extended Data Fig. 6a, b). Of note fetal gut cDC1 expressed more CCR7 than did cDC2 
  
5 
(Extended Data Fig. 5c), which might suggest preferential priming and greater migratory 
capacity within this population. Similar to adult migratory DC7, fetal MLN migratory DC 
expressed higher levels of CCR7 and the activation markers CD80, CD83 and CD86 than did 
DC with the resident phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 6c). Looking along the timeline of the 
2nd trimester of gestation, we found that while MLN from 14-15wk EGA fetuses contained 
abundant resident DC, migratory DC were scarce or absent (Fig. 2c, d), suggesting that fetal 
gut DC begin migrating to the MLN from 16-17wk EGA. The presence of migratory DC in the 
MLN is consistent with expression of the lymph node-homing cytokines CCL19 and CCL2114 
in the fetal gut and MLN (Extended Data Fig. 6d, e). Migratory HLA-DR+ cells were also 
visualized within the lymphatic vessels (LYVE-1+) of 17-22wk EGA fetal skin (Extended 
Data Fig. 6f), using a protocol validated in adult skin8, providing confirmation that fetal cDC 
can migrate via lymphatic vessels in vivo. Furthermore, we observed fetal DC actively 
migrating out of skin explants over a period of 48 hours (Extended Data Fig. 6g), using ex 
vivo skin assays validated in adult tissues15. In summary, our data suggest that fetal skin and 
gut DC have the capacity to migrate through lymphatics and to lymph nodes from 16wk EGA, 
where they may interact with fetal T cells that are present in lymphoid organs from 10wk 
EGA16. The reason for the initiation of DC migration to the lymph nodes around 16wk EGA 
remains unclear: while the human lymphatic system is structurally complete by 8wk EGA, it 
may remain functionally immature for some time thereafter17.  
 
Next, we asked whether fetal cDC were able to respond to ligation of their toll-like 
receptors (TLR)18 and/or to stimulate naïve T cells in vitro. We sorted the most abundant cDC 
subset, splenic cDC2, from 17-22wk EGA fetuses and adult samples and exposed them to a 
panel of TLR agonists: adult and fetal cells secreted similar amounts of the pro-inflammatory 
cytokines GM-CSF, IL-6, IL-8 and MIP-1b (Fig. 3a, Extended Data Fig. 7a), in line with 
their similar expression of pattern recognition receptors (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Moreover, 
fetal and adult splenic cDC2 induced comparable proliferation of allogeneic CFSE-labeled 
adult splenic T cells in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) (Fig. 3b). Thus fetal cDC are 
capable of both sensing pathogens and stimulating T cells, which, together with their migratory 
ability, indicates that they have the potential to initiate an immune response to microbe-derived 
products around 17wk EGA.  
 
  
6 
While this shows that fetal cDC are capable of initiating allogeneic T cell proliferation 
in vitro, we know that life-long in vivo tolerance towards non-inherited maternal allogeneic 
antigens is established during gestation2,9,19Thus, to understand how fetal DC contribute to such 
tolerogenic T cell responses, we examined the phenotype of the T cell populations generated 
from MLR, where fetal or adult cDC2 were co-cultured with allogeneic adult spleen T cells. 
After 6 days co-culture, fetal spleen cDC2 induced the differentiation of significantly higher 
frequencies of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+CD127-CTLA4+ bona fide T regulatory cells (Treg)1,20,21 
than did adult splenic cDC2 (Extended Data Fig. 8 a, b, c). Confirming the 
immunosuppressive capacity of fetal cDC2-induced Tregs, CD8+ T cell proliferation was 
significantly impaired upon co-culture with fetal cDC2 as opposed to adult cDC2 (Extended 
Data Fig. 8d), and was restored when CD4+ T cells were removed (Extended Data Fig. 8e). 
In addition, allogeneic T cells cultured with fetal cDC2 (Figure 4a) or cDC1 (Extended Data 
Fig. 8f) produced significantly less of several pro-inflammatory cytokines and significantly 
more of the Th2-polarising cytokine IL-4, but not IL-13, compared with allogeneic T cells 
incubated with adult cDC2. Thus, consistent with the establishment of fetal tolerance to 
maternal antigens in vivo, fetal cDC initiate Treg induction and do not launch T cell pro-
inflammatory responses in vitro. 
 
The observed functional differences between fetal and adult DC were mirrored at their 
gene expression level, with over 3,000 genes being significantly differentially expressed 
between fetal and adult APC (Fig. 9a, SI Table 10, 11). IPA revealed that multiple pathways 
involved in educating T cells were significantly differentially regulated between fetal and adult 
APC, as were several pathways involved in the iNOS/TNF-α axis (Extended Data Fig. 9b,  
red and black arrows, respectively, SI Table 12). Further analysis revealed that a number of 
genes involved in immune-suppression/inflammation were differentially expressed (Extended 
Data Fig 9c). Of particular interest was the elevated expression of arginase-2 by fetal spleen 
cDC2 (Fig. 4b, c) and cDC1 (Extended Data Fig. 9d, e) in comparison with adult spleen cDC. 
Of note, arginase 2 expression was not modulated by TLR stimulation (Extended Data Fig. 
9f). Arginase depletes the local environment of L-arginine (by converting L-arginine to L-
ornithine and urea) which is required for the production of TNF-a22,23. Importantly, arginase 
activity has been shown to be an essential player in the regulation of TNF-a levels in the 
neonate22.  
 
  
7 
Coincidingly, we found that in stimulated splenic culture (i.e. include APC), fetal T 
cells did not produced TNF-a compared to adult T cells (Fig. 4d, Extended Data Fig. 10a). 
However, when enriched (i.e. in the absence of APC), they produced TNF-a, although to a 
lesser level to their adult counterparts (Fig. 4d). Furthermore, we found significantly lower 
frequencies of fetal T cells producing TNF-a than adult T cells after 6 days of culture 
(Extended Data Fig. 10b). In addition, when fetal and adult splenocytes were co-cultured at 
increasing ratios of fetal cells, adult T cell TNF-a production was impaired. While fetal 
splenocytes also promoted Treg induction, the change in TNF-a levels did not correlate with 
the change observed in Treg induction (Extended Data Fig. 10b-d).  These data suggested 
that the differential arginase-2 expression between adult and fetal cDC is sufficient to regulate 
T cell responses and their TNF-a production.  
 
In the absence of any cDC, approximately 24% of proliferating adult splenic T cells 
produced TNF-a, while following 6 days co-culture with fetal cDC2 (Fig. 4e, f) or cDC1 
(Extended Data Fig. 9g) that express arginase-2, their ability to produce TNF-a was 
dramatically reduced. TNF-a production was reinstated upon replenishing the medium with L-
arginine or by the addition of arginase-specific inhibitors22 (Fig. 4e, f), confirming that the 
reduced TNF-a production was mediated through arginase-2 activity. Treg numbers did not 
change when arginase activity was modulated, suggesting fetal DC regulation of TNF-a 
production is independent of their promotion of Treg induction (Extended Data Fig. S10e-h). 
Further analysis of the supernatants from the co-cultures found that fetal cDC did not mediate 
T cell production of other pro-inflammatory cytokines by arginase activity (Extended Data 
Fig. 10i-k), suggesting fetal DC utilize a range of mechanisms to regulate T cell biology which 
remain to be explored. We also found that when fetal cDC were cultured with adult cDC2, they 
could abrogate adult cDC2 promotion of TNF-a production by T cells (Extended Data Fig. 
10l, m). In addition, when fetal T cells were cultured in the absence of cDC, they produced 
TNF-a, but when co-cultured with fetal cDC their ability to produce TNF-a was significantly 
impaired (Fig. 4g). Altogether, these data confirm that in the absence of TLR stimulation, fetal 
DC promote immune-suppression and impair T cell TNF-a production in response to 
allogeneic antigens through expression of arginase-2. Importantly, a recent study highlighted 
the crucial role of L-arginine as major modulator of adult T cell biology24.  
 
  
8 
In summary, our findings uncovered a yet unknown mechanism of tolerance and 
immune suppression that is used during gestation by fetal cDC and works in concert with others 
mechanisms used by fetal NK cells25 and Tregs1. Understanding the mechanisms through 
which TNF-a production is regulated within the fetus is important as elevated levels of TNF-
a are associated with a number of pregnancy and perinatal complications including recurrent 
spontaneous miscarriage, gestational diabetes and necrotizing enterocolitis. Our data suggest 
that the regulation of L-arginine levels by fetal DC is important for controlling T cell TNF-a 
levels during gestation placing fetal DC are key regulators of TNF-a production and should be 
investigated as potential therapeutic target in such situations. In addition, our study 
demonstrates that fetal cDC are immunologically dynamic and can orchestrate immune 
responses as early as in the 2nd trimester. How TLR stimulation during intrauterine infections 
can override immune-suppression induced by arginase 2 expressing fetal DC in an allogeneic 
context remain to be explored. Altogether, these findings highlight that key processes in human 
immune development and programming in fact begin early during gestation and may have life-
long implications for immune homeostasis19.

Supplementary Experimental Procedures 
 
Human samples and consent 
The donation of fetal tissue for research is approved by the Centralised Institutional Research 
Board (CIRB) of the Singapore Health Services in Singapore. This approval strictly follows 
established international guidelines regarding the use of fetal tissue for research26. This 
  
12 
approval allowed the collection of fetal tissue from women undergoing clinically-indicated 
termination of pregnancies for the study of immune cells in different fetal tissues. Women gave 
written informed consent for the donation of fetal tissue to research nurses who were not 
directly involved in the research, or in the clinical treatments of women participating in the 
study as per the Polkinghorne guidelines26. This protocol has been reviewed on an annual basis 
by the CIRB that includes annual monitoring of any adverse events, for which there had been 
none.  All fetal organs for this study (lung, thymus, spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, gut, 
appendix, liver, tonsil and skin) were obtained from 2nd trimester (12-22 wk EGA). All fetuses 
were considered structurally normal on ultrasound examination prior to termination and by 
gross morphological examination following termination. In total 72 fetuses of 14-16 wk EGA 
and 24 fetuses of 17-22 wk EGA were used for this study. For comparisons across fetal organs 
the same donors were used, for example for CyTOF data analysis. 
Adult tissue (lung, spleen, gut and skin) were obtained with approval from Singapore 
Singhealth and National Health Care Group Research Ethics Committees. 
 
Cell isolation 
Fetal organs were mechanically dispersed and incubated with 0.2 mg/ml collagenase (Type IV; 
Sigma Aldrich) and DNase I (20000U/ml, Roche) in RPMI with 10% FCS for up to 1 hour in 
a 6 well plate. Viability was typically 80-90% measured by DAPI exclusion (Partec). Fetal gut 
was initially cut longitudinally through the center, washed extensively in PBS until all inner 
content (meconium) was removed and the PBS was clear, before mechanical dispersion and 
digestion as above, for up to 1h. Adult lung specimens (8 samples from different donors) were 
obtained from peritumoral tissue. Adult skin (20 samples from different donors) was obtained 
from mammoplasty and breast reconstruction surgery. Adult spleen specimens (8 samples from 
different donors) were obtained at distal pancreatectomies in patients with pancreatic tumours 
in the pancreas. Adult lung27 and skin8 specimens were prepared as described previously. Adult 
spleen specimens were prepared in a similar manner to lung. Tissue macrophages and DC were 
isolated to 95% purity from freshly digested tissue cell suspensions by fluorescence activated 
cell sorting (FACS) using BD FACSAriaII or III (BD Biosciences). T cells were isolated to 
90% purity from adult and fetal spleen by negative selection using T cell enrichment kits 
(Miltenyi Biotec) and separated on an AutoMacs following manufacturer’s instructions. T cells 
were labeled with 0.2µM carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) (Life Technologies) 
for 5 minutes at 37°C. In all experiments enriched APC and T cells were from fetal and adult 
spleen unless stated otherwise. 
  
13 
 
Flow cytometry 
Flow cytometry was performed on a BDLSRII and data analyzed with FlowJo (Treestar). 
Antibodies used are listed in Table 12. The eBioscience FOXP3 / Transcription Factor Staining 
Buffer Set (eBioscience/Affimetrix) was used for intracellular staining of IRF8, IRF4, CTLA4, 
arginase-2, TNF-α and FOXP3 cells by following manufacturer’s instructions. 
ALDEFLUORTM kit (STEMCELL technologies) was used to measure ALDH activity. 
 
Mixed lymphocyte reactions 
5,000 sorted cDC from defined subpopulations were co-cultured with 100,000 CFSE-labeled 
adult or fetal spleen T cells for 6 days in 200µl complete RPMI-1640 GlutamaxTM medium 
(Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin27. On day 6, 
cells supernatants (100µl) were removed and stored at -80oC for detection of the cytokines 
indicated in Fig. 4a, Extended Data Fig. 8f, 10h-j) at a later date. Cytokines were detected 
using Luminex® bead-based multiplex assays, as detailed below. For analysis of intracellular 
TNF-α production analysis, on day 6 of co-cultures T cells were re-stimulated with 10µg/ml 
phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and 500 µg/ml Ionomycin for 1 hour at 37°C. 10 µg/ml 
Brefeldin A solution was added for 4 hours. Intracellular cytokine production was determined 
by flow cytometry. In some experiments on Day 0, the arginase inhibitors S-(2-boronoethyl)-
l-cysteine (BEC) or amino-2-borono-6-hexanoic acid (ABH) (each used at 30µM respectively) 
were added to co-cultures. In some experiments on Day 6, 1 mM l-arginine was added to co-
cultures 1 hour prior to stimulation with PMA/Ionomycin. 
 
Ex-vivo co-culture assays 
Fetal or adult splenocytes (1x105) were seeded into 96-well round bottom plates alone or 
combined at defined ratios in 200µl medium. After o/n or 6 days of co-culture the splenocytes 
were stimulated with 10 µg/ml phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (InvivoGen) and 500 µg/ml 
Ionomycin (Sigma) for 1 hour at 37°C. 10 µg/ml Brefeldin A solution was added for 4 hours. 
Intracellular T cell TNF-a production was determined by flow cytometry as described above. 
 
Millipore Luminex® bead-based multiplex assays on supernatants from mixed 
lymphocyte reactions 
  
14 
Samples (supernatants) or standards were incubated with fluorescent-coded magnetic beads 
pre-coated with cytokine-specific capture antibodies. After an overnight incubation at 4°C with 
shaking, plates were washed twice with wash buffer. Biotinylated detection antibodies specific 
to the cytokine of interest were incubated with the complex for 1 hour and subsequently 
Streptavidin-PE was added and incubated for another 30 minutes. Plates were washed twice 
again, and beads were re-suspended with sheath fluid before a minimum of 50 beads per 
cytokine were analysed on the Luminex FLEXMAP® 3D (Merck Millipore). Data acquisition 
was carried out using xPONENT® 4.0 (Luminex) acquisition software, with data analysed in 
Bio-Plex Manager® 6.1.1 (Bio-Rad). Cytokine concentrations were calculated from the 
standard curve using a 5PL (5-parameter logistic) curve fit. 
 
Drop array Luminex assays on fetal and adult spleen cDC2 
Sorted fetal (17-22wk EGA) and adult spleen cDC2 were incubated for 18 hours at 20,000 
cells/well in 100µl complete RPMI-1640 GlutamaxTM medium (Life Technologies) 
supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and stimulated with either TLR 
agonists; CL075 (1µg/ml), CPG (3µM), PI:C (25µg/ml), PGN (10µg/ml), LPS (0.1µg/ml) + 
CD40L (1µg/ml), or DMSO control. Cells were then pelleted and 95µl of supernatants were 
collected. Fetal and adult spleen cDC2 cytokine production was assessed using Luminex® 
bead-based multiplex assays. Cytokines indicated in the figures were detected with 
DropArrayTM-bead plates (Curiox) according to manufacturers’ recommendations. Acquisition 
was performed with the xPONENT 4.0 (Luminex) acquisition software, while data analysis 
was performed with Bio-Plex Manager 6.1.1 (Bio-Rad). 
 
Mass cytometry staining, barcoding, acquisition and data pre-processing 
For mass cytometry analysis, purified antibodies were obtained from Invitrogen, Fluidigm, 
Biolegend, eBioscience, Beckton Dickinson and R&D Systems using clones as listed in SI 
Table 13. For some markers, fluorophore- or biotin-conjugated antibodies were used as 
primary antibodies, followed by secondary labeling with anti-fluorophore metal-conjugated 
antibodies (i.e. anti-FITC clone FIT-22) or metal conjugated streptavidin produced as 
previously described11. Briefly, cells were plated, stained, and labeled in a V-bottom 96 well 
plate (BD Falcon). Cells were washed once with 200µl FACS buffer (4% FBS, 2mM EDTA, 
0.05% Azide in 1X PBS), followed by staining with 100µl of 200µM cisplatin (Sigma-Aldrich) 
for 5 minutes on ice to exclude dead cells. Cells were then labelled with anti-CADM1-biotin 
  
15 
and antibodies in a 50µl reaction volume for 30 minutes on ice. Cells were washed twice with 
FACS buffer and labeled with 50µl heavy-metal isotope-conjugated secondary antibody 
cocktail for 30 minutes on ice. Cells were washed twice with FACS buffer then once with PBS 
before fixation with 200µl 2% PFA (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in PBS overnight or 
longer. Following fixation, cells were pelleted and resuspended in 200µl 1X perm buffer 
(Biolegend) and allowed to stand for 5 minutes at room temperature. Cells were washed once 
with PBS before barcoding. Bromoacetamidobenzyl-EDTA (BABE)-linked metal barcodes 
were prepared by dissolving BABE (Dojindo) in 100mM HEPES buffer (Gibco) to a final 
concentration of 2mM. Then isotopically-purified PdCl2  (Trace Sciences Inc.) was added to 
BABE solution to 0.5mM. Similarly, DOTA-maleimide (DM)-linked metal barcodes were 
prepared by dissolving DM (Macrocyclics) in L buffer (MAXPAR) to a final concentration of 
1mM. Then, 50mM of RhCl3 (Sigma) and isotopically-purified LnCl3 were added to DM 
solution to 0.5mM. Six metal barcodes were used: BABE-Pd-102, BABE-Pd-104, BABE-Pd-
106, BABE-Pd-108, BABE-Pd-110 and DM-Ln-113. All BABE and DM-metal solution 
mixtures were immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80oC. A unique dual 
combination of barcodes was chosen to stain each tissue sample. Barcode Pd-102 was used at 
1:4000 dilution, Pd-104 at 1:2000, Pd-106 and Pd-108 at 1:1000, and Pd-110 and Ln-113 at 
1:500. Cells were incubated with 100µL of barcodes in PBS for 30 minutes on ice. Cells were 
then washed in perm buffer and incubated in FACS buffer for 10 minutes on ice. Cells were 
then pelleted and resuspended in 100µl of nucleic acid Ir-Intercalator (MAXPAR) in 2% 
PFA/PBS (1:2000), at room temperature. After 20 minutes, cells were washed twice with 
FACS buffer and twice with water before a final resuspension in water. In each set, cells were 
pooled from all tissue types, enumerated, and diluted to a final concentration of 0.5x106 
cells/ml for acquisition. EQ Four Element Calibration Beads (DVS Science, Fluidigm) were 
added at a concentration of 1% prior to acquisition. Cells were acquired and analyzed using a 
CyTOF Mass cytometer. The data were exported in a traditional flow-cytometry-file (.fcs) 
format and cells for each barcode were deconvolved using Boolean gating.  
 
OneSense Analysis 
The automated analysis was performed by the OneSense algorithm as described previously11. 
For Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 4b, 5b the lineage dimension included CD1c and SIRPa as 
cDC2 markers and CD26 and CLEC9A as cDC1 markers. The marker dimension includes all 
the other non-lineage markers of the CyTOF panel. Frequency heat maps of indicated markers 
  
16 
are displayed for both dimensions. cDC2 clusters (cyan gate) and cDC1 clusters (green gate) 
for each organ and their marker expression profile are highlighted by the extended gates 
(representative plots of n=5). For comparisons across fetal organs, organs from the same donor 
were used. 
 
Microarray analysis  
Total RNA was isolated from FACS-purified fetal spleen and skin (17-22wk EGA) CD14+ 
cells, cDC1 and cDC2 subsets and adult spleen CD14+ cells, cDC1 and cDC2 subsets with the 
Qiagen RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen). Total RNA integrity was assessed using Agilent 
Bioanalyzer and the RNA Integrity Number (RIN) was calculated; all RNA samples had a RIN 
≥ 7.1. Biotinylated cRNA was prepared according to the protocol by Epicentre TargetAmp™ 
2-Round Biotin-aRNA Amplification Kit 3.0 using 500pg of total RNA. Hybridization of 
cRNA was performed on Illumina Human-HT12 Version 4 chips. Microarray data were 
exported from GenomeStudio software without background subtraction. Expression values 
were quantile normalized and log2 transformed in R (version 3.1.2) with Bioconductor (version 
2.26.0) lumi package (version 2.18.0). For generation of fetal APC subset gene signatures, one 
cell subset was compared with other cell subsets pooled using t-test in R. DEGs were selected 
with Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) multiple testing28 corrected p-value of < 0.05. For the adult 
APC gene expression data, samples were grouped by tissue type and tissue specific probes 
were identified with one-way ANOVA and with BH multiple testing corrected p-value of < 
0.05. CMAP analysis as previously described11 was performed comparing fetal DC signature 
gene subsets with the adult APC gene expression data after removal of the tissue-specific 
probes (see Extended Data Fig. 3 for hierarchical clustering and PCA plots before and after 
removal of tissue specific probes). To identify the genes that are highly or lowly expressed in 
a particular cell subset, we used the single-class rank product method29, which is implemented 
in the Bioconductor RankProd package (version 2.38.0), and selected the top and bottom 
ranked genes with percentage of false-positives (PFP) less than 0.01. The in-house generated 
adult and fetal microarray data have been submitted to the Gene Expression Ominous (GEO) 
database under the accession numbers GSE35457, GSE85305, and GSE85304. 
 
Quantitative real-time PCR 
Total RNA was isolated from adult or fetal gut and mesenteric lymph node (14-20wk EGA) 
cells with the Qiagen RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen). Total RNA integrity and concentration was 
assessed using nanodrop 2000 (Thermoscientific). Total RNA (1 µg) was reverse transcribed 
  
17 
using oligo (dT)18 primer and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (GIBCO-BRL). CCL19 and 
CCL21 expression was analysed by Quantitative real-time PCR using the following primer: 
+5-CCAGCCTCACATCACTCACACCTTGC-3 
and 
−5-
TGTGGTGAACACTACAGCAGGCACCC-3 
for 
CCL19; 
+5-
AACCAAGCTTAGGCTGCTCCATCCCA-3 
and 
−5-
TATGGCCCTTTAGGGGTCTGTGACCG-3 for CCL21. CCL19 and CCL21 expression was 
normalized 
to 
the 
housekeeping 
gene 
GAPDH 
+5-
GCCAAGGTCATCCATGACAACTTTGG-3 
and 
−5-
GCCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTGATGTC-3.

Extended Data Fig. 3. Fetal APC populations cluster based on subset after the removal 
of tissue specific probes. a-d, Hierarchical clustering and PCA data before (a, c) and after (b, 
d) removal of tissue specific probes. It is clear from the hierarchical clustering (a) that there is 
strong tissue imprinting in the cells that overwhelms subtype specificity. Upon the removal of 
tissue specific probes, cells now cluster based on subtype (b). Also clearly from the PCA plots 
(c, d), we can see that prior to tissue gene removal (c), PC1 is entirely determined by tissue. 
However, upon tissue specific probe removal (d), PC1 is now devoted to cell type. We 
  
19 
identified these tissue-specific genes by finding DEGs between the pools of all cells from the 
different tissues (all spleen vs. all skin).

presence of L-arginine (1mM) (n=5), BEC (30µM) (n=3), ABH (30µM) (n=5) for 6 days (mean 
± s.e.m n≥3). Statistical significance represents comparisons between indicated conditions 
measured by one-way Anova, multiple comparisons test. *P<0.05, **P<0.01 ns P>0.05. j, 
Adult spleen T cells were cultured overnight with the indicated of L-arginine, BEC and ABH 
(n=5). Representative flow cytometry of n=3 experiments. k, Cytokines detected in co-culture 
supernatants after adult spleen T cells were cultured alone (in the absence of DC) for 6 days 
with or without L-arginine (1mM) (n=5), BEC (30µM) (n=3), ABH (30µM) (n=4) (mean ± 
s.e.m n≥3). l, m, Fetal spleen cDC (pooled cDC1 and cDC2) and adult spleen cDC2 were 
cultured alone or in combination at the indicated ratios with adult spleen T cells for 6 days.  T 
cell TNF-a production (k) and the expansion of Tregs (l) were assessed by flow cytometry. 
Statistical significance represents comparisons between indicated conditions measured by one-
way Anova, multiple comparisons test. * P<0.05, ns P>0.05. Each data point in all the scatter 
plots represents an individual donor and experiment.
