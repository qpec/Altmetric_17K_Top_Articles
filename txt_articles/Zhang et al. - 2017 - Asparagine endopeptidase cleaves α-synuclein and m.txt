 Aggregated forms of α-synuclein play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies such 
as Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenic 
effects of α-synuclein are not completely understood. Here we show that asparagine 
endopeptidase (AEP) cleaves human α-synuclein, triggers its aggregation and escalates its 
neurotoxicity, thus leading to dopaminergic neuronal loss and motor impairments in a mouse 
model. AEP is activated and cleaves human α-synuclein at N103 in an age-dependent manner. 
AEP is highly activated in human brains with PD, and it fragments α-synuclein, which is found 
aggregated in Lewy bodies. Overexpression of the AEP-cleaved α-synuclein1–103 fragment in the 
substantia nigra induces both dopaminergic neuronal loss and movement defects in mice. In 
contrast, inhibition of AEP-mediated cleavage of α-synuclein (wild type and A53T mutant) 
diminishes α-synuclein’s pathologic effects. Together, these findings support AEP’s role as a key 
mediator of α-synuclein-related etiopathological effects in PD.
PD is characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra 
(SN) pars compacta. The etiology of PD appears to be multifactorial, involving both genetic 
and environmental components. To date, several cellular mechanisms, such as aberrant 
protein folding, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction have been implicated in the 
development and progression of this disease1. Most PD cases are sporadic, and their 
pathogenesis is unclear. However, several cases of familial PD have been described in which 
mutant genes have been identified as being causative in this disorder. These genes include 
the abundant presynaptic protein α-synuclein2,3 and two components of the proteasome 
pathway: L1 ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase4 and parkin5. The misfolding of α-synuclein, 
the main component of Lewy pathology, plays a key role in the etiopathogenesis of PD, 
because the disorder is characterized by the accumulation of intraneuronal protein 
aggregates (Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites)6. Several mutations in the gene encoding α-
synuclein, including A30P, A53T and E64K, have been identified in dominant forms of 
familial PD2,3. Moreover, duplication or triplication of the wild-type α-synuclein-encoding 
gene also causes PD, thus indicating that an increased α-synuclein protein level is sufficient 
to cause the disease. Furthermore, single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the α-synuclein-
encoding gene are associated with an increased risk of developing sporadic PD7. The 
potential mechanisms of α-synuclein in PD have been explored by transgenic expression of 
human α-synuclein in various models8–10. Although these studies have demonstrated a 
pathological effect resulting from transgenic expression, including the formation of 
inclusion bodies, the molecular mechanisms involved in neurodegeneration remain obscure.
The physiological function of α-synuclein is poorly understood11. α-Synuclein is widely 
expressed in the nervous system, where it is found in presynaptic nerve terminals, closely 
associated with presynaptic vesicles11. The neurotoxicity of α-synuclein may be related to 
its oligomerization and fibrillization12 or may be due to a loss of functional protein, owing to 
the formation of insoluble aggregates. Mounting evidence indicates that C-terminal 
truncation promotes α-synuclein fibrillization13–16, in a process mediated by numerous 
proteases such as calpain17,18 and cathepsin D19,20. However, whether these proteases 
proteolytically cleave α-synuclein and mediate their pathological effects in an age-
dependent manner in PD etiopathology remains unclear.

 Mammalian AEP (also called legumain) is an endolysosomal cysteine protease that cleaves 
proteins after asparagine residues. AEP is synthesized as an inactive zymogen, and its 
activation requires sequential removal of C- and N-terminal propeptides at different pH 
thresholds21,22. AEP activity is controlled by the cysteine protease inhibitor cystatin C23. 
Recently, we have reported that neuronal AEP is activated by acidosis during excitotoxicity 
and contributes to neuronal apoptosis by degrading the DNase inhibitor SET24,25. Moreover, 
AEP-generated SET fragments inhibit protein phosphatase-2A and enhance tau 
hyperphosphorylation26. We have also shown that AEP cleaves TAR DNA-binding protein 
43 in brain samples from humans with frontotemporal lobar degeneration27. Most recently, 
we have found that AEP cleaves tau at residues N255 and N368, thereby mediating 
formation of neurofibrillary tangles in human brains with Alzheimer’s disease (AD)28. 
Further, we have found that AEP acts as a δ-secretase that cleaves APP at residues N373 and 
N585, thereby regulating BACE1 fragmentation of the C-terminal fragment of APP and 
resulting in β-amyloid generation. Deletion of AEP from tau P301S or 5XFAD transgenic 
mice substantially alleviates the pathological and cognitive defects28,29.
PD is a chronic neurodegenerative disease, and aging is the major risk factor for PD 
development. We have recently reported that AEP protein levels are increased in the brain in 
an age-dependent manner28,29. Hence, it is possible that AEP might also process α-
synuclein in the brains of people with PD during aging. In the current study, we tested this 
hypothesis and found that AEP cleaves α-synuclein at N103 in the human PD brain and 
promotes α-synuclein aggregation and neurotoxicity. Interestingly, AEP is activated in an 
age-dependent manner and contributes to and/or is concurrent with α-synuclein truncation in 
the SN. Overexpression of the α-synuclein1–103 fragment in the rodent SN induces 
dopaminergic neurodegeneration and a resultant motor phenotype, whereas blockade of 
cleavage of α-synuclein (either wild type or A53T mutant) by AEP ameliorates these α-
synuclein-mediated pathological effects. Hence, our observations demonstrate that AEP 
contributes to the α-synuclein pathogenic activity in PD.
RESULTS
Cleavage of α-synuclein at N103 in PD and Lewy body dementia
To investigate the proteolytic processing of α-synuclein in PD, we conducted a proteomic 
analysis with immunoprecipitated α-synuclein from PD brains. Notably, LC–MS/MS 
analysis revealed an α-synuclein peptide fragment cleaved at N103 from the partial tryptic 
peptides (Fig. 1a). To detect the α-synuclein N103 fragment, we generated a neoepitope 
antibody (designated anti-N103) that specifically recognized the cleaved α-synuclein N103 
fragment but not the full-length protein. ELISA measurements demonstrated that this 
antibody was highly selective for the α-synuclein1–103 fragment rather than intact α-
synuclein (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Western blot analysis with recombinant full-length (FL) 
α-synuclein and its fragment comprising residues 1–103 confirmed that this antibody 
selectively recognized α-synuclein1–103 but not FL α-synuclein. The antibody also 
immunoprecipitated the cleaved N103 fragment from PD brains (Fig. 1b,c). To confirm that 
α-synuclein cleavage after N103 indeed occurs in people with synucleinopathy, we 
conducted immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays. IHC analysis of brain sections with anti–α-

 synuclein N103 clearly indicated that α-synuclein was cleaved after N103 in brains with PD 
or Lewy body dementia (LBD) but not in control brains without synucleinopathy. The 
antibody specificity was corroborated with a blocking peptide (Fig. 1d). 
Immunofluorescence (IF) staining confirmed that the α-synuclein N103 fragment was 
present as aggregates in Lewy bodies and synaptic structures (Fig. 1e and Supplementary 
Fig. 1b). Immunoblotting with the α-synuclein N103–specific antibody revealed that α-
synuclein N103 was elevated specifically in both the soluble and insoluble fractions of SN 
tissues from PD brains, and its level was much higher than that observed in cortical tissues 
from the same subjects. By contrast, α-synuclein N103 was scarcely detectable in both brain 
regions in controls without synucleinopathy (Fig. 1f). Remarkably, α-synuclein N103 was 
readily detectable in brains with LBD compared with controls. These findings were further 
confirmed with anti-α-synuclein antibody. Interestingly, AEP was activated in the LBD 
brain samples, and this activation correlated with α-synuclein fragmentation patterns (Fig. 
1g and Supplementary Fig. 1c–e). Thus, α-synuclein N103 fragmentation occurred 
predominantly in brains with PD or LBD but not in controls without synucleinopathy.
AEP cuts human α-synuclein at residue N103
AEP is the only reported mammalian enzyme that cleaves C terminal to asparagine. Hence, 
we hypothesized that AEP is responsible for the cleavage of α-synuclein after N103. To test 
this hypothesis, we transfected N-terminally GFP-tagged human α-synuclein into HEK293 
cells and incubated cell lysates with kidney lysates (pH 7.4 or 6.0) prepared from wild-type 
or AEP-knockout mice. A truncated α-synuclein band was selectively observed in wild-type 
kidney lysates at pH 6.0 but was not observed in AEP-knockout kidney lysates or at pH 7.4. 
The cleavage of α-synuclein was reconstituted when exogenous active AEP was added to 
the AEP-knockout reactions (Fig. 2a). AEP enzymatic activity in the reactions was 
confirmed (Fig. 2a). GFP-tagged α-synuclein was also cleaved in mouse brain lysates in the 
same pattern as that in kidney lysates (Fig. 2b). We also tested the cleavage of C-terminally 
GFP-tagged α-synuclein in mouse kidney and brain lysates, and found the same results (Fig. 
2c,d). When GFP-α-synuclein was incubated with wild-type kidney lysates for 5, 10 or 15 
min, the intensity of the truncated α-synuclein fragment increased over time at pH 6.0 (Fig. 
2e), thus indicating that AEP in the active kidney lysates truncates α-synuclein in a time-
dependent manner. Cys189 is essential for the protease activity of AEP, and cleavage after 
N323 is obligatory for the maturation of the protease30. As expected, α-synuclein was 
cleaved by wild-type but not by mutated (C189S or N323A) AEP, thereby indicating that 
AEP’s enzymatic activity was responsible for the observed α-synuclein proteolytic cleavage 
(Fig. 2f). AEP is selectively inhibited by the small peptide AENK but not the control peptide 
AEQK24. Accordingly, AENK but not AEQK selectively antagonized GFP-α-synuclein 
cleavage by active AEP in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2g). Furthermore, recombinant 
active AEP directly cleaved recombinant α-synuclein in a time-dependent manner, and the 
resultant fragment was recognized by anti–α-synuclein N103 antibody. The cleavage was 
blocked by the AEP inhibitor AENK (Fig. 2h,i). Together, these results indicated that α-
synuclein is a direct biological substrate of AEP.
To determine whether there are multiple AEP-cleavage sites in α-synuclein, we conducted a 
mapping assay with a variety of truncated α-synuclein recombinant proteins. FL α-

 synuclein produced a fragment of the same size as the 1–103 fragment, thus indicating that 
α-synuclein was cut near residue 103 (Supplementary Fig. 2a). MS analysis identified the α-
synuclein N103 fragment from purified mammalian GST-α-synuclein recombinant proteins 
cleaved by active AEP in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Because AEP selectively cleaves its 
substrates after asparagine residues, and human α-synuclein contains three asparagine 
residues (N65, N103 and N122), we prepared three α-synuclein point mutants with 
asparagine changed to alanine. Both N-terminal and C-terminal GFP-tagged α-synuclein 
N65A and N122A mutants were cleaved as efficiently as wild-type α-synuclein by AEP, 
whereas the N103A mutation completely abolished cleavage (Supplementary Fig. 2c,d). 
Interestingly, mouse α-synuclein does not contain residue N103, but human α-synuclein 
does. Accordingly, human but not mouse α-synuclein was selectively fragmented by AEP 
(Supplementary Fig. 2e,f).
To confirm the interaction between AEP and α-synuclein, we performed 
coimmunoprecipitation and found that α-synuclein interacted with AEP in human PD brains 
(Supplementary Fig. 3a), where it may cleave α-synuclein. The proteolytic actions in human 
PD brain lysates were selectively blocked by anti-AEP but not control IgG, thus supporting 
the specific processing of α-synuclein N103 by AEP (Supplementary Fig. 3b). 
Immunofluorescence staining with human brain slides revealed that AEP strictly colocalized 
with LAMP1, the specific marker for lysosomes in control brains, whereas it leaked out into 
the cytoplasm and was not tightly colocalized with LAMP1 in PD brains (Supplementary 
Fig. 3c). Indeed, our subcellular fractionation assay also demonstrated that the activity of 
AEP was enhanced in the cytoplasm in PD brains compared with controls (Supplementary 
Fig. 3d). Cleavage assays with exogenous α-synuclein recombinant proteins demonstrated 
that PD and LBD brain cytosolic fractions displayed much stronger N103 cleavage activities 
than those of control cytosolic fractions, whereas the lysosomal fractions exhibited similar 
effects among control, PD and LBD brains (Supplementary Fig. 3e). These results suggested 
that AEP may leak from the lysosomes into the cytoplasm, where it cleaves α-synuclein in 
synucleinopathies.
AEP cleaves α-synuclein independently of post-translational modifications
Phosphorylation of α-synuclein at S129 and Y125 regulates α-synuclein aggregation and 
toxicity31. To test whether S129 phosphorylation influences α-synuclein cleavage by AEP, 
we conducted an in vitro cleavage assay using recombinant α-synuclein and S129-
phosphorylated α-synuclein. The S129-phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated α-synuclein 
were cleaved in a time-dependent manner with similar rates, thus indicating that 
phosphorylation of α-synuclein at S129 does not interfere with AEP cleavage 
(Supplementary Fig. 4a). α-Synuclein is also phosphorylated at Y125 by the Src family 
protein tyrosine kinase Fyn32. Nonetheless, both wild-type human α-synuclein and the 
Y125F mutant exhibited comparable cleavage rates by AEP (Supplementary Fig. 4b). 
Moreover, phosphorylation of α-synuclein at Y125 by overexpression of constitutively 
active or kinase-dead Fyn mutants did not affect its cleavage rate, thus further confirming 
that Y125 phosphorylation does not affect human α-synuclein cleavage (Supplementary Fig. 
4c,d). We also tested the cleavage rate of the familial PD-associated A53T and A30P 
missense mutations and found that these mutants were also cleaved at the same rate as wild-

 type α-synuclein (Supplementary Fig. 4e). A number of proteinases have been implicated in 
α-synuclein cleavage, including calpain, cathepsin D and the proteasome33. To explore their 
potential effects on N103 fragmentation, we used specific inhibitors or a protease-inhibitor 
cocktail inhibiting serine proteases, aminpeptidases, cysteine proteases and acid proteases. 
Notably, α-synuclein cleavage was inhibited by only the peptide inhibitor AENK but not by 
any of the other protease inhibitors or the protease-inhibitor cocktail (Supplementary Fig. 
4f). Thus, these results indicated that AEP is the major protease cleaving human α-synuclein 
at N103, and its proteolytic activity is independent of other post-translational modifications.
AEP is activated and cleaves α-synuclein in an age-dependent manner
We have recently reported that AEP is selectively upregulated and activated in the brain in 
an age-dependent manner28,29. To explore whether this enzyme truncates human α-
synuclein in a similar temporal pattern, we used a mouse transgenic model with the mouse 
α-synuclein-encoding gene (Snca) replaced with a human version, and we performed 
immunoblotting on SN and cortex-tissue samples from mice at 1.5, 3, 5 and 7 months of 
age. We found that α-synuclein was cleaved at N103 in an age-dependent manner. 
Fragmentation was clearly more prominent in the SN than the cortex, in a manner tightly 
coupled to the spatial and temporal patterns of AEP activity. In contrast, no cleavage signals 
were detected in wild-type or Snca-knockout SN tissues (Fig. 3a–c). Therefore, these 
findings indicated that AEP specifically cleaves human α-synuclein in an age-dependent 
manner, more prominently in the SN region than in the cortex. We also extended these 
studies to wild-type mice and found that AEP activity increased in an age-dependent 
manner, and the SN activity was much higher than that in the cortex (Supplementary Fig. 5). 
Interestingly, we observed the same result in SN and cortex samples from human PD brains 
(Fig. 3d). Hence, AEP is prone to being activated in the SN versus the cortex.
Cleavage of α-synuclein by AEP promotes its aggregation and toxicity
To determine the effect of AEP cleavage of α-synuclein on fibrillization, we monitored the 
kinetics of filament formation by FL α-synuclein or the AEP-derived α-synuclein1–103 
fragment at different concentrations, by using thioflavin T staining. We found that the α-
synuclein1–103 fragment aggregated much faster and to a greater extent than did FL α-
synuclein (Fig. 4a). Ultracentrifugation assays revealed that more aggregated α-
synuclein1–103 than FL α-synuclein was present in the pellet (Fig. 4b). Electron microscopy 
confirmed the aggregation of α-synuclein into fibrils (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Furthermore, 
the α-synuclein1–103 fragment significantly promoted the aggregation of FL α-synuclein 
even at very low concentrations (Fig. 4c). We also tested the seeding capacity of fibrils from 
the α-synuclein1–103 fragment and that from the full-length protein. We found that α-
synuclein1–103 fibrils, compared with FL α-synuclein fibrils, seeded the α-synuclein with a 
much higher capacity (Fig. 4d). Thus, these findings suggested that AEP cleavage of α-
synuclein may promote α-synuclein aggregation.
α-Synuclein truncation and oligomerization are tightly associated with its neurotoxicity12; 
therefore, we conducted dopaminergic neuronal cell death assays. As expected, 
overexpression of α-synuclein induced apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons, and this effect 
was more pronounced with the α-synuclein1–103 fragment (Fig. 4e). In addition, the α-

 synuclein1–103 fragment formed more aggregates, as indicated by IF staining with an 
antibody specific to aggregated α-synuclein (Fig. 4f). Furthermore, the α-synuclein1–103 
fragment formed more abundant higher-molecular-weight species than did FL α-synuclein 
(Fig. 4g). Hence, the AEP-derived α-synuclein N103 fragment is more prone to aggregation 
and exhibits stronger neurotoxicity. IF staining and subcellular fractionation assays indicated 
that most FL and truncated α-synuclein localized in the cytosolic fraction (Supplementary 
Fig. 6b,c).
AEP-cleaved α-synuclein induces dopamine neuronal loss and motor deficits in vivo
To assess the pathological roles of the α-synuclein1–103 fragment in vivo, we used 
adenoassociated viruses (AAVs) expressing either FL wild-type α-synuclein or the 1–103 
fragment, which were delivered by unilateral injection into the mouse SN. Four months after 
the vector delivery, we performed IHC and IF staining on the brain sections to validate 
transduction. IHC analysis with LB509, an antibody recognizing residues 115–122 of human 
α-synuclein, revealed that FL α-synuclein was strongly expressed, whereas the α-
synuclein1–103 fragment was not detected (Supplementary Fig. 7a). By contrast, IF with the 
specific anti–α-synuclein N103 antibody demonstrated robust immunoreactivity toward α-
synuclein1–103 in brains injected with AAVs expressing the α-synuclein1–103 fragment. In 
addition, some α-synuclein N103 signal was detectable in brains injected with FL human α-
synuclein (Supplementary Fig. 7b), thus indicating that the FL human α-synuclein had been 
truncated at N103 in the SN. Immunoblotting with the same specific antibodies selectively 
recognizing FL human α-synuclein or the N103 truncation also confirmed these 
observations (Fig. 5a). As expected, overexpression of the α-synuclein1–103 fragment 
resulted in a significant loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression in the striatum. In 
contrast, the effect of FL α-synuclein expression was much less pronounced (Fig. 5b). To 
investigate the effect of the α-synuclein1–103 fragment on motor function, we performed a 
panel of behavioral tests including rotarod tests, amphetamine-induced rotational behavior 
tests, cylinder tests and grid assays. The rotarod test showed decreased latency in mice 
injected with AAV-α-synuclein1–103 compared with FL α-synuclein (Fig. 5c), thus 
indicating that the α-synuclein1–103 fragment triggers much more severe dopaminergic 
neuronal loss than does FL. In agreement with this finding, overexpression of the α-
synuclein1–103 fragment, as compared with FL overexpression, produced increased 
amphetamine-induced rotational asymmetry and increased forepaw impairment (cylinder 
test) (Fig. 5c). The grid test also demonstrated an evident motor deficit in AAV-α-
synuclein1–103 mice compared with AAV-FL mice (Fig. 5c). Together, these behavioral tests 
indicated that the human α-synuclein1–103 fragment induces more severe motor impairment 
than does the FL counterpart. Quantification of TH immunoreactivity (stereological cell 
counts of TH-positive neurons and densitometry of TH-positive striatal terminals) supported 
these findings: the SN and striatum in mice injected with AAV-α-synuclein1–103, compared 
with AAV-α-synuclein FL, contained significantly fewer TH-positive neurons and termini 
(Fig. 5d). Immunostaining of the proteinase K–treated slides indicated more aggregates in 
mice injected in the SN with AAV-α-synuclein1–103 compared with AAV-α-synuclein FL 
(Fig. 5e). Finally, HPLC analysis of striatal tissues showed significantly decreased dopamine 
concentrations in mice injected with the AAV-α-synuclein1–103 fragment compared with 
Zhang et al.

 AAV-α-synuclein FL (Fig. 5f). Hence, these findings demonstrated that the AEP-generated 
α-synuclein1–103 fragment is sufficient to induce a PD-like pattern of neurodegeneration.
Knockout of AEP ameliorates α-synuclein’s pathological effects
We then sought to further confirm the role of AEP in the cleavage of α-synuclein and the 
subsequent dopaminergic neuronal loss and motor deficits. To do so, we used AAVs to 
overexpress human α-synuclein in wild-type and AEP-knockout mice. Animals were 
euthanized 4 months after the injection, and IF analysis confirmed that TH-positive 
dopaminergic neurons in the injected SN expressed GFP or human α-synuclein (Fig. 6a,b). 
Immunoblotting confirmed these observations. As predicted, FL α-synuclein was selectively 
cleaved at N103 by AEP in wild-type but not knockout mice. Injection of α-synuclein virus 
induced a significant striatal TH-immunoreactivity loss. Deletion of AEP partially reversed 
the loss of striatal TH expression (Fig. 6c). Similarly, the striatal dopamine content was 
significantly decreased in wild-type mice compared with AEP-knockout mice (Fig. 6d). In 
agreement with these observations, overexpression of human α-synuclein induced more 
severe motor deficits in wild-type mice than GFP control mice, as detected through the 
motor tests described above. Again, this effect was significantly alleviated in AEP-knockout 
mice (Fig. 6e). A quantitative analysis of TH-positive neurons demonstrated that 
dopaminergic neurons were drastically lost in the SN, with concomitant denervation of the 
striatum, when human α-synuclein was overexpressed in wild-type mice, as compared with 
GFP control mice. This neurotoxic effect was reversed when AEP was depleted (Fig. 6f). 
IHC with anti–human α-synuclein and IF analysis with anti–α-synuclein N103 showed that 
α-synuclein was successfully overexpressed in the SN regions and that α-synuclein was 
truncated at N103 in wild-type but not knockout mice (Fig. 6g,h). The intraneuronal 
aggregation of α-synuclein was more pronounced in wild-type mice than knockout mice, 
and the aggregates were partially resistant to proteinase K digestion (Fig. 6g). Furthermore, 
the α-synuclein aggregates exhibited coimmunostaining with 14-3-3 and ubiquitin, thus 
suggesting that these aggregates were Lewy body–like inclusions (Supplementary Fig. 7c–f). 
Therefore, these data indicated that the deletion of AEP ameliorates α-synuclein 
fragmentation, attenuates its aggregation and alleviates its neurotoxicity.
Blockade of α-synuclein (A53T) cleavage by AEP prevents its pathological activities
The A53T mutant of α-synuclein is linked to autosomal-dominant early-onset PD. 
Transgenic mice expressing mutant A53T show age-dependent formation of intraneuronal 
α-synuclein inclusions that recapitulate the features in humans with PD, and they also 
develop severe and complex motor impairment34,35. To assess whether these pathological 
effects caused by the A53T mutant are related to N103 cleavage by AEP, we generated an 
uncleavable mutant (A53TN103A) that was overexpressed through AAVs in the SN in wild-
type mice. Four months after the AAV injection, expression of human α-synuclein (A53T) 
or its uncleavable mutant was confirmed with IHC. Proteinase K–resistant α-synuclein 
aggregates were more abundant after expression of A53T as compared with the uncleavable 
mutant (Fig. 7a). IF analysis with anti-N103 antibody showed that A53T proteins were 
clearly fragmented at N103; in contrast, no cleavage of A53TN103A proteins was observed 
(Fig. 7a). AEP activity assays indicated that the ratio between cytosolic and lysosomal AEP 
activities increased in mice injected with AAV-α-synuclein wild type and AAV-α-synuclein

 A53T, as compared with mice injected with AAV-GFP, thus indicating lysosomal leakage 
(Supplementary Fig. 7g). Immunoblotting verified that both mutants were highly expressed 
and that the A53T protein was truncated at N103, whereas the uncleavable mutant remained 
intact. In agreement with our findings above, mice injected with A53TN103A-mutant α-
synuclein virus, as compared with A53T mice, were partially spared from motor deficits, 
thus implicating AEP cleavage of α-synuclein in movement disorders elicited by the A53T 
mutant (Fig. 7c). Accordingly, TH immunoreactivity in both the SN and striatum was 
significantly lower in A53T-expressing brains than in brains expressing the uncleavable 
mutant (Fig. 7b,d). Finally, striatal dopamine concentrations in mice injected with the 
uncleavable mutant were significantly higher than those in mice injected with the A53T 
mutant (Fig. 7e). Collectively, these data suggested that blockade of α-synuclein (A53T) 
cleavage by AEP antagonizes its deleterious pathological activities, thus again supporting 
PD-relevant AEP-mediated truncation of α-synuclein.
DISCUSSION
AEP is a lysosomal protease that leaks into the cytoplasm in neurodegenerative diseases26. 
Here we report that AEP cleaves human α-synuclein at N103 in an age-dependent manner 
and triggers α-synuclein aggregation and neurotoxicity, thus leading to dopaminergic 
neuronal loss and motor impairment. Notably, we found that AEP is highly activated in 
human PD and LBD brains compared with age-matched healthy controls, especially in the 
SN. As a consequence, human α-synuclein is cleaved at N103, and this fragment is present 
in Lewy bodies. In agreement with these observations, we showed that human α-synuclein 
was cleaved at N103 in human α-synuclein–transgenic mice in an age-dependent manner, 
and this activity was tightly coupled with the temporal pattern of AEP activity escalation. 
The age-dependent activation of AEP indicates that AEP expression is gradually increased, 
and/or endogenous AEP inhibitors, such as cystatin C, are decreased during aging. 
Furthermore, the pH in the brain gradually decreases during aging36, and this decrease may 
elicit AEP activation. Thus, AEP processes α-synuclein in an age-dependent manner. Next, 
we provided extensive evidence demonstrating that AEP directly cleaves human but not 
mouse α-synuclein at the N103 residue. Interestingly, although human α-synuclein shares 
95% identity with its mouse counterpart, mouse α-synuclein does not have an N103 residue. 
Notably, the A53T mutation in human α-synuclein causes dominant forms of familial PD, 
whereas the fifty-third position in wild-type mouse α-synuclein is T (Supplementary Fig. 
2e). Hence, mouse α-synuclein possesses different key residues from the human version, 
and these residues may exhibit distinct biological activities.
Cystatin C is the endogenous inhibitor of AEP. Mounting evidence implicates cystatin C in 
the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases including AD, stroke and epilepsy37. During 
aging, an elevated AEP level and/or decreased cystatin C level may mediate the gradual 
cleavage of α-synuclein and promote its aggregation during the pathogenesis of 
synucleinopathies. Here, we also provided evidence that AEP is secreted from lysosomes 
into the cytoplasm in human PD brains, where it may cleave α-synuclein (Supplementary 
Fig. 3). These observations are consistent with findings from previous reports indicating that 
the lysosomal AEP penetrates into the cytoplasm in human AD brains and cleaves both tau

 and SET, a PP2A inhibitor, thereby mediating AD pathogenesis26. In fact, AEP has been 
found to be active in the near-neutral pH milieus of the cytosol, nucleus and cell surface38.
Post-translational modifications including phosphorylation, truncation and ubiquitination 
can affect the structure and aggregation properties of α-synuclein39. C-terminal truncation 
promotes α-synuclein fibrillization, in a process mediated by numerous proteases including 
neurosin, calpain, cathepsin D and metalloproteinase12. Nevertheless, the roles of these 
proteases in the pathogenesis of PD remain elusive. Here we provided extensive biochemical 
evidence demonstrating that AEP cleaves α-synuclein at N103 in an age-dependent manner. 
Notably, the cleaved human α-synuclein1–103 fragment is more prone to aggregation than 
the full-length protein (Fig. 4) and forms Lewy body-like aggregations in the SN (Fig. 6, 
Supplementary Fig. 7), thus providing further evidence of the role of C-terminally truncated 
α-synuclein in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases including PD. We observed 
some minor truncated α-synuclein bands at ~12 kDa in human and mouse brains (Figs. 1, 5 
and 7). This result is consistent with previous findings of distinct α-synuclein truncations at 
sites downstream of N103, including at positions 119 (ref. 14), 121 (ref. 40) and 122 (ref. 
18), in synucleinopathies and in vivo models. Under different stresses or animal models, a 
variety of proteases including caspases or calpains may be activated and mediate α-
synuclein proteolytic cleavage at various sites, thus contributing to α-synuclein aggregation 
and neurotoxicity. Nonetheless, AEP cleavage of α-synuclein at N103 during the aging 
process provides an additional mechanism accounting for AEP’s detrimental effect.
To test the hypothesis that AEP cleavage of human α-synuclein contributes to PD 
pathogenesis, we provided gain-of-function and loss-of-function evidence (Figs. 5–7). As 
expected, the human α-synuclein1–103 fragment was more potent than FL α-synuclein in 
provoking dopaminergic neuronal loss and motor deficits (Fig. 5). However, although 
overexpression of FL human α-synuclein in wild-type mice notably produced clear 
dopaminergic neurodegeneration, as compared with that in GFP controls, far fewer 
pathological hallmarks were observed in AEP-null mice (Fig. 6). This result suggested that 
AEP promotes the neurotoxic effect of α-synuclein. The same scenario applied to the A53T 
mutant, which was even more toxic. We demonstrated that blockade of A53T α-synuclein 
cleavage by AEP greatly suppressed its pathologic activities in PD (Fig. 7). Furthermore, the 
amount of α-synuclein1–103 fragments in human PD SN tissue and mouse SN injected with 
α-synuclein virus was comparable (Supplementary Fig. 8), thus suggesting that the amount 
in the human PD SN was sufficient to induce neurotoxicity. Together, our in vivo data 
support the hypothesis that AEP cleavage of human α-synuclein promotes the onset of PD 
pathologies. These findings notably indicate that the α-synuclein1–103 fragment might act as 
the major pathological trigger of dopaminergic neuronal loss in PD. Therefore, these 
findings suggest that AEP may be a novel drug target and that the inhibition of AEP may 
hold promise as a useful strategy for treating PD.

 The AEP-knockout mice on a mixed 129/Ola and C57BL/6 background were generated as 
previously reported41. Only male mice were used in the experiments. Animal care and 
handling was performed according to Emory Medical School guidelines. Sample size was 
determined in Power and Precision software (Biostat). The mice were randomized into 
different groups by using a random number table. Investigators were blinded to the group 
allocation during the animal experiments. The protocol was reviewed and approved by the 
Emory Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Human tissue samples
Postmortem brain samples were dissected from the frozen brains of five control cases, LBD 
cases, and PD cases obtained from the Emory Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center. The 
study was approved by the biospecimen committee at Emory University. PD and LBD cases 
were clinically diagnosed and neuropathologically confirmed. Informed consent was 
obtained from all subjects.
Cell lines, transfection and infection
HEK293 cells were obtained from the ATCC and tested for mycoplasma contamination 
before use. Cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or point-mutant GFP-
α-synuclein, myc-AEP, myc–AEP C189S, or myc–AEP N323A by the calcium phosphate 
precipitation method. AAVs were used to express wild-type, mutant and truncated α-
synuclein in primary neurons and SH-SY5Y cells. The neurotoxicity was analyzed through 
TUNEL analysis or LDH assays.
In vitro α-synuclein cleavage assay
To assess the cleavage of α-synuclein by AEP in vitro, HEK293 cells were transfected with 
GST- or GFP-tagged α-synuclein DNA through the calcium phosphate precipitation method. 
48 h after transfection, cells were collected, washed once in PBS, lysed in buffer (50 mM 
sodium citrate, 5 mM DTT, 0.1% CHAPS, pH 5.5, and 0.5% Triton X-100), and centrifuged 
for 10 min at 14,000g at 4 °C. The supernatant was then incubated with mouse kidney lysate 
or recombinant AEP at pH 7.4 or 6.0 at 37 °C for different time points. To test the effects of 
cathepsin, calpain and AEP inhibitors on the cleavage of α-synuclein by AEP, inhibitors 
were used against cathepsin (E64, Sigma-Aldrich), calpains (ALLN, Sigma-Aldrich) and 
AEP (AENK peptide inhibitor and inactive control AEQK). To measure the cleavage of 
purified α-synuclein fragments by AEP, GST-tagged α-synuclein was purified with 
glutathione beads. The purified α-synuclein protein was incubated with recombinant AEP 
protein (Novoprotein, 5 µg ml−1) in buffer (50 mM sodium citrate, 5 mM DTT, 0.1% 
CHAPS and 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 6.0). The samples were then boiled in 1× SDS loading 
buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting.
AEP activity assay
Tissue homogenates or cell lysates (10 µg) were incubated in 200 µl assay buffer (20 mM 
citric acid, 60 mM Na2HPO4, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS and 1 mM DTT, pH 6.0) 
containing 20 µM AEP substrate Z-Ala-Ala-Asn-AMC (Bachem). AMC released by

 substrate cleavage was quantified by measuring at 460 nm in a fluorescence plate reader at 
37 °C for 1 h in kinetic mode for 5 min.
Mass spectrometry analysis
Protein samples were in-gel-digested with 10 ng/µl Glu-C. Peptide samples were 
resuspended in loading buffer (0.1% formic acid, 0.03% trifluoroacetic acid and 1% 
acetonitrile) and loaded onto a 20-cm nano-HPLC column (internal diameter, 75 µm) packed 
with Reprosil-Pur 120 C18-AQ 1.9-µm beads (Dr. Maisch) and eluted over a 2-h 1–50% 
buffer B reverse-phase gradient (buffer A, 0.1% formic acid and 1% acetonitrile in water; 
buffer B, 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) generated by a Dionex RSLCnano UPLC system 
(Thermo). Peptides were ionized with 2.0-kV electrospray ionization voltage from a nano-
ESI source on an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo). Data-dependent acquisition 
of MS spectra at 120,000 resolution (FWHM), and MS/MS spectra were obtained in the 
Orbitrap after electron-transfer dissociation (ETD) with supplemental activation with high 
energy (EThcD) for peptide masses corresponding to the 3+ and 4+ charge states (645.3536 
and 484.2669, respectively) of the peptide GAGSIAAATGFVKKDQLGKN. To identify 
AEP-cleavage sites in human α-synuclein, Proteome Discoverer 2.0 (PD) was used to search 
and match MS/MS spectra to a complete human proteome database (NCBI reference 
sequence revision 62, with 68746 entries) with a ±10-p.p.m. mass-accuracy threshold and 
allowable cleavages at glutamates and asparagines. A percolator was used to filter the 
peptide spectral matches (PSM) to a false discovery rate (FDR) of <1%. All MS/MS spectra 
for putative AEP-generated α-synuclein cleavage sites were manually inspected.
Generation of antibodies specific to AEP-generated α-synuclein (anti–α-synuclein N103)
Two rabbits were immunized with the peptide Ac-CVKKDQLGKN-OH, which included the 
nine amino acids in α-synuclein that precede the AEP-cleavage site at N103 as well as an N-
terminal cysteine residue to allow for coupling to KLH. The rabbits were received booster 
injections four times with the immunizing peptide with 3-week intervals between injections. 
The antiserum was affinity purified by chromatography with the immunizing peptide and 
was then absorbed to a spanning peptide spanning the N103 cleavage site (Ac-
CKDQLGKNEEGAPQE-amide). The titers against the immunizing peptide were 
determined by ELISA. The maximal dilution giving a positive response with chromogenic 
substrate for horseradish peroxidase was 1:30,000. The immunoactivity of the antiserum was 
further confirmed by western blotting and immunohistochemistry.
Western blot analysis
The mouse brain tissue or human tissue samples were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 
7.4, 40 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1.5 mM Na3VO4, 50 mM NaF, 10 mM 
sodium pyrophosphate and 10 mM sodium β-glycerophosphate, supplemented with a 
cocktail of protease inhibitors), and centrifuged for 15 min at 16,000g. The supernatant was 
boiled in SDS loading buffer. After SDS–PAGE, the samples were transferred to a 
nitrocellulose membrane. Primary antibodies to the following targets were used: GST-HRP 
(Sigma-Aldrich, GERPN1236), α-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich, T9026), HA (Santa Cruz, 
H3663), myc (Santa Cruz, M4439), α-synuclein N terminus (Santa Cruz, sc-514908); anti-
α-synuclein (syn1, clone 42, BD Bioscience, 610787), AEP (clone 6E3, gift from C. Watts),

 TH (Cell Signaling Technology, 2792), α-synuclein C terminus (Cell Signaling Technology, 
2642) and α-synuclein LB509 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 180215).
Immunostaining
Paraffin-embedded human brain sections or free-floating mouse brain sections were treated 
with 0.3% H2O2 for 10 min. Sections were thereafter washed three times in PBS, blocked in 
1% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100 for 30 min and incubated overnight with anti-TH (1:1,000) 
antibody, anti–α-synuclein N103 antibody (1:1,000) or α-synuclein LB509 antibody (1:500) 
at 4 °C. The signal was developed with a Histostain-SP kit (Invitrogen). To detect the 
localization of the α-synuclein1–103 fragment in Lewy bodies in human PD brain sections, 
the sections were incubated with rabbit anti–α-synuclein N103 primary antibody and mouse 
anti-α-synuclein antibody overnight at 4 °C. The slides were washed three times in PBS and 
incubated with Texas red–conjugated anti-mouse IgG and FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG 
for 1 h at room temperature. The slides were washed three times in PBS, then covered with a 
glass cover with mounting solution and examined under a fluorescence microscope 
(Olympus). The primary cultured neurons were infected with AAVs encoding full-length α-
synuclein or the α-synuclein1–103 fragment, and were double-stained for α-synuclein/TH, 
TUNEL/TH or TH/N103. The percentages of TUNEL+/TH+ cells over TH+ cells were 
calculated. The researchers who performed immunostaining and cell counting were blinded 
to the group allocations.
Coimmunoprecipitation
The mouse brain tissue samples were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 40 mM 
NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1.5 mM Na3VO4, 50 mM NaF, 10 mM sodium 
pyrophosphate and 10 mM sodium β-glycerophosphate, supplemented with a cocktail of 
protease inhibitors) and centrifuged for 15 min at 16,000g. The supernatant was incubated 
with anti-α-synuclein antibody and Protein A/G–agarose overnight at 4 °C. After extensive 
washing with lysis buffer, the bound proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in 
Laemmli sample buffer and were subjected to western blot analyses.
In vitro aggregation of α-synuclein
The aggregation of α-synuclein was induced as described previously42. Briefly, purified α-
synuclein protein (rPeptide, 5 mg ml−1) was first incubated with vehicle or AEP in for 1 h 
and then dialyzed against PBS, pH 7.0. The samples were incubated at 37 °C with 
continuous shaking for 3 d. The aggregation kinetics of α-synuclein was measured with 
thioflavin T staining. 100 µl of 20 µM thioflavin T was mixed with 2 µl α-synuclein protein 
and incubated for 5–10 min at room temperature. Fluorometric readings were taken at 450-
nm excitation and 510-nm emission. The remaining solutions of aggregated α-synuclein 
were centrifuged at 100,000g for 30 min to separate the aggregated α-synuclein pellet and 
the nonaggregated α-synuclein supernatant, and analyzed by western blotting.
AAV vector packaging and stereotaxic injection
293T cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding the viral genome together with a 
plasmid encoding AAV2 rep, AAV5 cap, as well as helper functions. 72 h post-transduction,

 virus particles were harvested by repeated freeze–thaw cycles, purified with an iodixanol 
gradient and subsequent column chromatography, dialyzed against modified (enhanced 
Mg2+/Ca2+) PBS and concentrated to the desired titer with an Apollo concentrator (Orbital 
Biosciences). Three-month-old wild-type C57BL/6J mice were anesthetized with 
phenobarbital (75 mg kg−1). Unilateral intracerebral injection of AAVs was performed 
stereotaxically at coordinates anteroposterior (AP) −3.1 mm and mediolateral (ML) −1.2 
mm relative to the bregma, and dorsoventral (DV) −4.0 mm from the dural surface. 2 µl of 
viral suspension containing 3 × 1013 vector genomes (vg) ml−1 was injected into each site 
with a 10-µl glass syringe with a fixed needle at a rate of 0.25 µl min−1. The needle remained 
in place for 5 min before it was removed slowly (over 2 min). The mice were placed on a 
heating pad until they began to recover from the surgery.
Primary neuron cultures
Primary rat ventral midbrain culture neurons were cultured as previously described43. To 
measure the effects of α-synuclein fragments on neurons, neurons cultured 7 d in vitro (DIV 
7) were infected with AAVs encoding FL α-synuclein or α-synuclein1–103. 5 d later, the 
neurons were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized and immunostained with anti-TH 
antibody. The toxic effect of α-synuclein fragments was detected with an In situ cell death 
detection kit (Roche). The apoptotic index was expressed as a percentage of TUNEL-
positive neurons out of the total number of TH-positive neurons.
Behavioral tests
Motor impairments were tested 15 weeks after the virus injection with rotarod tests, cylinder 
tests, amphetamine-induced rotation tests, and grid tests. In the rotarod tests, animals were 
trained for 2 min at a speed of 4 r.p.m. After this initial training, mice performed eight trials 
for a maximum of 5 min with increasing speed starting from 4 r.p.m. and increasing to 40 
r.p.m. The fall-off time was recorded. In the cylinder tests, mice were placed individually 
inside a glass cylinder (12-cm diameter, 22 cm-height). Video recordings were examined by 
an observer blinded to the animal’s identity. Between 20 and 30 wall touches per animal 
(contacts with fully extended digits executed with the forelimb ipsilateral and contralateral 
to the lesion) were counted. In the amphetamine-induced rotation tests, animals that had 
been unilaterally injected with AAV vectors were challenged with d-amphetamine (free 
base, 2 mg/kg in saline, intramuscular, Sigma). The number of completed circles either to 
the left or to the right was counted.
Stereological quantification of TH-positive cells
The number of TH-positive cells in the SN was estimated with a random-sampling 
stereological counting method. For each animal, every fourth section throughout the 
rostrocaudal extent of the SN and every fourth section covering the entire extent of the STR 
were incorporated into the counting procedure. The investigator was blinded to the 
conditions of the experiment.

 HPLC analysis of dopamine
Dopamine levels were determined by HPLC with coulometric detection through established 
methods44. Each brain sample was processed individually. Samples were homogenized in 
0.1 N HClO4 solution (containing 0.01% sodium metabisulfite and 25 ng/ml internal 
standard 3, 4-dihydroxybenzylamine HBr) and centrifuged at 13,000g for 15 min at 4 °C. 
Aliquots of supernatant fractions were filtered with a 0.2-µm HT Tuffryn membrane (Pall), 
then injected into an Ultrasphere 5 µm ODS column, 250 × 4.6-mm (Hichrom Limited) and 
separated with a mobile phase containing 0.1 M sodium phosphate, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.30 
mM sodium octyl sulfate and 5% (v/v) acetonitrile, pH 3.2. The dopamine amount (ng/
sample) was then quantified by comparison to internal standards, with a standard curve 
generated with 0.1–5 ng of dopamine standard. The protein level (mg/sample) was 
determined with Lowry protein assays with a standard curve generated with 0–95 µg bovine 
serum albumin45.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with either Student’s t test (two-group comparison) or 
one-way ANOVA followed by LSD post hoc test (more than two groups), and differences 
with P values <0.05 were considered significant. Detailed information on the experimental 
design and reagents can be found in the Life Sciences Reporting Summary.
