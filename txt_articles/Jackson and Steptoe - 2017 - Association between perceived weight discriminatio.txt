ABSTRACT
Objective: To examine the association between
perceived weight discrimination and physical activity in
a large population-based sample.
Design: Data were from 2423 men and 3057 women
aged ≥50 years participating in Wave 5 (2010/11) of
the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Participants
reported experiences of weight discrimination in
everyday life and frequency of light, moderate and
vigorous physical activities. We used logistic
regression to test associations between perceived
weight discrimination and physical activity, controlling
for age, sex, socioeconomic status and body mass
index (BMI).
Results: Perceived weight discrimination was
associated with almost 60% higher odds of being
inactive (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.40, p=.028) and
30% lower odds of engaging in moderate or vigorous
activity at least once a week (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.53 to
0.94, p=.017).
Conclusions: Independent of BMI, individuals who
perceive unfair treatment on the basis of their weight
are less physically active than those who do not
perceive discrimination. This has important
implications for the health and well-being of individuals
who experience weight-based discrimination, and may
also contribute to a cycle of weight gain and further
mistreatment.
INTRODUCTION
Recent decades have seen concurrent rises
in obesity prevalence and stigmatisation of,
and discrimination against, people who carry
excess weight.1 National surveys in the UK
and
the
USA
have
revealed
reports
of
weight-related mistreatment by up to 7%,
14% and 43% of individuals with a body
mass index (BMI) in the overweight, moder-
ately
obese
and
severely
obese
ranges,
respectively.1 2
In addition to well-documented harmful
consequences for emotional well-being,3
4
there
is
increasing
evidence
that
weight
discrimination
may
adversely
affect
weight-related
behaviours,
for
example,
increasing intake of high-fat and high-calorie
foods,5 decreasing dietary quality6 and limit-
ing physical activity,7–11 although findings
have been somewhat contradictory. Studies
have shown that children, adolescents and
adults exposed to weight stigma are more
likely to avoid physical activity, even after
adjustment for BMI.7 8 10 12 However, associa-
tions between experiences of weight stigma
and actual exercise behaviour have not been
consistently observed. An experimental study
in children observed decreased participation
in physical activity following simulated ostra-
cism.11 In two small adult samples (n=100–
111), experiences of weight stigma were not
associated with self-reported mild, moderate
or strenuous physical activity, despite signifi-
cant negative correlations between stigma
experiences and reported avoidance of phys-
ical activity and between avoidance of phys-
ical
activity
and
self-reported
exercise
Strengths and limitations of this study
▪ First study to examine the relationship between
weight discrimination and physical activity in a
large population sample;
▪ use of a large, nationally representative sample
provides
robust
estimates
of
observed
associations;
▪ discrimination
and
physical
activity
were
assessed alongside a vast number of other mea-
sures, minimising reporting bias, but both were
self-reported global assessments which may be
limited by inaccuracies in reporting;
▪ height and weight were objectively measured,
providing an accurate measure of body mass
index, although these data were collected 2 years
prior to the discrimination data and changes in
weight may have occurred in the interim;
▪ cross-sectional study design prohibits causal
inferences.

 behaviour.7 8 In an online sample of 177 women, indivi-
duals who had experienced weight stigma reported
higher levels of physical activity, despite being less likely
to report believing that weight was under personal
control.13
This study aimed to help resolve these discrepant find-
ings by using data from a large (n>5000) nationally rep-
resentative
sample
taking
part
in
the
English
Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) to examine the
association between perceived weight discrimination and
self-reported physical activity.
METHOD
Study population
ELSA is a longitudinal panel study of men and women
aged ≥50 years living in England that started in 2002.
Participants are assessed on a two-yearly basis, with a
nurse visiting the home to obtain objective measure-
ments of health status, including weight in alternate
(even) waves. Wave 5 (2010/11) included items assessing
discrimination. Of the 9090 participants interviewed in
Wave 5, 7574 completed the questionnaire that mea-
sured experiences of discrimination and provided data
on physical activity. The present study uses these data as
well as BMI measurements collected in Wave 4 (2008/
09), as no anthropometric measurements were taken in
Wave 5. Our final analytic sample comprised 5480 parti-
cipants for whom complete data were available.
Measures
Perceived weight discrimination was assessed using items
based on those developed and used widely in US longi-
tudinal studies.1
14 Participants were asked how fre-
quently they experience five discriminatory situations in
their day-to-day life: ‘(1) you are treated with less
respect/courtesy; (2) you receive poorer service than
other people in restaurants/stores; (3) people act as if
they think you are not clever; (4) you are threatened/
harassed and (5) you receive poorer service or treatment
than
other
people
from
doctors/hospitals,’
with
responses on a scale from ‘never’ to ‘almost every day’.
The majority of participants reported never experien-
cing discrimination, skewing the distribution of the data,
so responses were dichotomised to distinguish between
these respondents and those who had ever experienced
discrimination
in
any
domain
(never
vs
all
other
options). Individuals reporting discrimination in at least
one domain were asked to indicate the reason(s) they
attributed their experience to from a list of character-
istics including weight, age, sex, race, physical disability,
an aspect of physical appearance, sexual orientation,
financial status or other reason. Those who attributed
any experience of discrimination to their weight are
treated as cases of perceived weight discrimination for
our analyses.
Physical activity was self-reported in response to three
questions on the frequency of participation in light,
moderate and vigorous activities (more than once a
week/once a week/one to three times a month/hardly
ever or never). For the present analyses, physical activity
was further categorised into four groups: inactive (no
activity on a weekly basis); only light activity at least once
a week; at least moderate but no vigorous activity at least
once a week and any vigorous activity at least once a
week. These thresholds were selected based on previous
work in ELSA demonstrating robust dose–response asso-
ciations with mortality.15 The main outcomes of interest
were inactivity and moderate or vigorous activity at least
once a week.
Age, sex, household non-pension wealth (a sensitive
measure of socioeconomic status (SES) in this age
group) and BMI (from measured height and weight)
were included as covariates.
Statistical analysis
We used weights to correct for sampling probabilities
and differential non-response and to calibrate back to
the 2011 national census population distributions for
age and sex. We used adjusted percentages to compare
the distribution of participants who did and did not
report weight discrimination across physical activity clas-
sifications, controlling for age, sex, SES and BMI. We
analysed associations between perceived weight discrim-
ination and physical activity using logistic regression,
with age, sex, SES and BMI as covariates and the no
weight discrimination group as the reference category.
Interactions between weight discrimination and BMI
were tested in order to explore whether associations
between weight discrimination and engagement in phys-
ical
activity
differed
according
to
the
degree
of
overweight.
RESULTS
Perceived weight discrimination was reported by 4.9% of
participants. Weight discrimination varied substantially
by weight status (p<0.001), rising from 0.8% in under-
weight and normal weight participants (n=1451) and
0.9% in overweight participants (n=2272) to 13.4% in
individuals with obesity (n=1757). Those who reported
weight discrimination tended to be younger and less
wealthy, but the groups did not differ significantly by sex
(table 1).
Figure 1 presents data on activity level by perceived
weight discrimination. Among participants who reported
weight discrimination, 10.3% reported no regular phys-
ical activity, 18.3% reported only light activity at least
once a week and moderate and vigorous intensity activity
was reported in 45.0% and 26.4%, respectively. Rates of
inactivity and light activity were comparatively lower in
the group which did not report weight discrimination, at
7.6% and 14.4% respectively, and rates of moderate and
vigorous activity were higher, at 48.9% and 29.1%
respectively. Logistic regression models confirmed these
differences,

 discrimination was significantly associated with almost
60% higher odds of being inactive (OR 1.59, 95% CI
1.05 to 2.40, p=.028) and 30% lower odds of engaging in
regular moderate or vigorous activity (OR 0.70, 95% CI
0.53 to 0.94, p=.017). Interactions between weight dis-
crimination and BMI were not significant for either
outcome.
DISCUSSION
This study is the first to examine the relationship
between weight discrimination and physical activity in a
large population-based sample. Previous studies have
shown increased motivation to avoid exercise in people
exposed to weight stigma.7 8 10 12 Our results are consist-
ent with these findings, demonstrating an association
between self-reported experiences of weight discrimin-
ation and engagement in physical activity in a sample of
middle-aged and older adults. Independent of differ-
ences in physical activity related to BMI, we saw that par-
ticipants who reported weight-based discrimination were
substantially more likely to report being sedentary, and
less likely to report regularly engaging in moderately or
vigorously energetic activities.
Previous
studies
that
have
examined
associations
between weight stigma and actual exercise behaviour
have produced mixed results.7

13 Our finding
linking weight discrimination with reduced physical
activity contrasts with one previous study in particular
that observed increased levels of physical activity among
women who had experienced weight stigma,13 but is
consistent with two other key findings from the same
study. First, the results showed that participants with
experience of weight stigma were less likely to believe
weight was controllable, which might reduce motivation
to engage in exercise for weight control purposes.
Second, weight bias internalisation (self-directed stigma)
was associated with lower levels of physical activity.
There are several reasons weight discrimination might
be related to lower levels of physical activity. Avoidance
of domains in which discrimination is likely to occur is a
common response to social identity threat.16 Individuals
who perceive discrimination may be more self-conscious
about exercising in front of people for fear that it might
attract undesirable attention. In a population survey,
more than one in five adults with obesity reported being
embarrassed and feeling too fat to exercise,17 and
studies in children indicate reluctance to participate in
school-based physical activity because of concerns over
potential
weight-related
teasing.18
Internalisation
of
weight bias may also result in a loss of self-efficacy and
motivation to achieve goals, leaving people wondering
why they should bother trying to be active.13
The observed association with lower physical activity
has implications for the health and well-being of those
who experience weight-based discrimination. Regular
physical activity has benefits for primary and secondary
prevention of numerous chronic diseases and reduces
the risk of premature death.19 Given that individuals
with obesity are already at increased risk for developing
many of these conditions,20 it is particularly important
to promote physical activity in this group. Importantly in
the context of weight discrimination, lower engagement
in physical activity may lead to increased obesity (even

Physical
activity
may
be
an
important mediator of previously demonstrated associa-
tions between weight discrimination, weight gain and
persistent obesity.14 21
The relationship between weight discrimination and
physical activity did not differ significantly by BMI, indi-
cating that individuals who experience weight discrimin-
ation are likely to be less physically active, regardless of
their weight. However, it should be noted that very few
(<1%) participants with a BMI <30 reported weight dis-
crimination, so this analysis may have been underpow-
ered. It is possible that a person who encounters weight
discrimination may lose weight but still avoid exercise.
Given the substantial health benefits of being physically
active, interventions that aim to reduce weight bias at a
population level—for example, through schools, local
communities or national campaigns—may have a greater
impact on health than those that encourage people to
lose weight. A Health at Every Size approach may be
helpful in promoting the adoption of healthy habits,
including regular physical activity, for the sake of health
and well-being as opposed to weight control.22 There has
been some evidence indicating long-term beneficial
effects of such an approach on eating behaviours.23
This study had limitations. Physical activity data were
self-reported, but a previous comparison in an ELSA
subsample showed a moderate correlation with objective
assessments (Spearman’s r=0.21, p=.020).24 Based on the
data in ELSA, we were unable to define the nationally
recommended physical activity threshold (2.5h of mod-
erate/vigorous physical activity weekly). However, previ-
ous
research
supports
our
chosen
threshold
as
a
meaningful
predictor
of
health
outcomes
in
this
cohort.15 It was not possible to analyse variations in the
intensity of discrimination, which may be differentially
associated with physical activity. Weight discrimination
was determined by self-reports of past experiences and
as a result may have been underreported due to
memory or recall biases. Participants could attribute
experiences of discrimination to one or more personal
characteristics from a presented list; although this did
offer advantages with regard to blinding the present
study’s
focus
on
weight-related
discrimination
and
thereby potentially reducing bias among heavier respon-
dents.
Items
measuring
discrimination
covered
five
generic domains (eg, being treated with less respect or
receiving poorer service in restaurants/stores), but did
not assess experiences that may be specific to weight dis-
crimination (eg, being required to pay for two passenger
seats when travelling by plane) and their omission may
again mean that the prevalence of weight discrimination
was underestimated. The study was cross-sectional which
prohibits inferences on causality, but previous research
showing individuals exposed to weight stigma subse-
quently report an increased desire to avoid exercise is
suggestive of a causal association.8 The timing of dis-
criminatory experiences could not be ascertained from
the questions used to assess discrimination, so it was not
possible to control for prior physical activity levels.
Height and weight were not measured at the same time
as discrimination, but previous work in this cohort has
shown very high stability in BMI over time,25 so it is
unlikely that this greatly influenced the present results.
Participants were from an older population, in which
levels of physical activity are likely to be lower26 and
experiences of weight discrimination are typically less
common1 relative to younger populations so findings
cannot be assumed to generalise. The prevalence of
weight discrimination was lower in our sample than has
been observed in previous studies that have examined
wider age ranges,1 27 but was very similar to rates of
weight
discrimination
reported
in
comparable
age
groups in a large US sample, where rates were 5.3% in
55–64-year-olds and 4.0% in 65–74-year-olds.27
In summary, these results provide evidence that weight
discrimination may be associated with lower participa-
tion in regular physical activity and higher rates of sed-
entary
behaviour.
Through
this
mechanism,
weight
discrimination may be implicated in the perpetuation of
weight gain, onset of obesity related comorbidities and
even premature mortality.
