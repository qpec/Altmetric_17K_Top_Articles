Rodent ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) are a vital tool for linking gene mutations to behavior in mouse 
models of communication disorders, such as autism [1]. However, we currently lack an understanding of 
15 
how physiological and physical mechanisms combine to generate acoustic features of the vocalizations, 
and thus cannot meaningfully relate those features to experimental treatments. Here we test and provide 
evidence against the two leading hypotheses explaining USV production: superficial vocal fold 
vibrations [2], and a hole-tone whistle [3]. Instead we propose and provide theoretical and experimental 
evidence for an alternative and novel vocal mechanism, a glottal jet impinging onto the laryngeal inner 
20 
planar wall. Our data provide a framework for future research on the neuromuscular control of mouse 
vocal production and for interpreting mouse vocal behavior phenotypes.   
Murine rodents produce USVs with complex acoustic song-like structure that play important 
social roles, such as mating and territory defense [4]. USVs are emitted between 30 -100 kHz peak

frequency (Fp) and often contain instantaneous Fp jumps separated by 15-35 kHz. USVs are 
25 
hypothetically produced by a hole-tone whistle mechanism (Hypothesis 1), where two spaced circular 
orifices generate a whistle [3] akin to the teakettle whistle [5]. These sounds are produced without 
structural motion, only aerodynamic and acoustic feedback. In rats, the Fp of USVs shifted upwards in 
lower density heliox atmosphere, supporting this mechanism [3]. The first orifice would be the glottis, 
and the location of the second orifice would be either a) the oropharyngeal opening leading to the 
30 
mouth, b) the epiglottis in semiclosed position, or c) superior vocal folds. Identification of the 
production mechanism and these constrictions is crucial for understanding the (constraints on) neural 
control of Fp and other acoustic parameters [6]. Alternatively, USVs could be produced by oscillation of 
only superficial vocal fold layers (Hypothesis 2), akin to the human “whistle” falsetto mode [2] where 
the effective oscillating mass is reduced compared to normal chest voice allowing higher oscillation 
35 
frequencies. 
 
To test these hypotheses, we studied sound production in excised mouse larynges using high-
speed imaging (100,000 frs/sec) of the vocal folds. With adducted vocal folds, a glottal opening was 
located between the arytenoid cartilages on the dorsal side of the larynx (Fig 1A,B). Above subglottal 
air flow of 1-2 ml/s, USVs were readily elicited in the larynges of 15 animals (7 females and 8 males). 
40 
The frequencies of in vitro USVs corresponded well to in vivo USVs (Fig S1). We extracted glottal 
shape parameters (N=5) from high-speed video (Fig 1B). Glottal width did not oscillate at sound 
frequencies (Fig 1C), arguing against an oscillating vocal fold origin of USVs (contra Hypothesis 2). 
These data suggest that if mice use a hole-tone whistle mechanism to produce USVs, both constrictions 
must be confined within the larynx.  
45 
To test if USVs are produced by a hole-tone whistle mechanism and determine the location of 
the second constriction, we subsequently removed the epiglottis and thyroid cartilage to just above the 
  
3 
vocal folds. Removal of the epiglottis silenced the larynx in 2 out of 7 animals, but upper thyroid 
removal silenced 7 out of 7 preparations (Fig 1D), which suggests the upper thyroid is essential to USV 
production. To further test this hypothesis, we replaced the upper thyroid with a metal plate (N=5); 
50 
USVs recovered 100% after rescue. Because USVs are generated without a second constriction present, 
these observations are inconsistent with the hole-tone mechanism (contra Hypothesis 1).  
Self-sustained whistles can occur when an air jet impinges on an object, a phenomenon that has 
predominantly received attention for supersonic and high-speed subsonic flows [7-9]. The tones are 
caused by a feedback loop between coherent flow structures travelling downstream and acoustic waves 
55 
travelling upstream in the flow [7].  Feedback could also happen in reverberating acoustic conditions. 
Both rat and mouse in vivo USVs and our in vitro data clearly show stable frequency modes and jumps 
between modes, indicating this system is resonance driven.  
We propose that rodent USVs are produced by feedback between downstream convecting 
coherent flow structures from the glottis and upstream-propagating acoustic waves. The downstream 
60 
convecting flow structures are generated by instabilities in the jet formed at the glottal opening. The 
upstream-propagating acoustic waves are generated by impingement of the coherent flow structures on 
the planar inner laryngeal wall, consisting of thyroid, and perhaps partially epiglottis. The resonance 
frequencies, fn, require an integer number (n) of waves be present:  𝑛 = 𝑓
𝑛( 𝑥/𝑐 + 𝑥/𝑢), where x is the 
distance between jet exit (glottis) and planar wall, i.e. impingement length (Fig 1E), u is the mean 
65 
convection speed of the coherent structures, approximated as jet exit speed, and 𝑐 is sound speed [7].  
Because 𝑢/𝑐 ≪  1, the whistling frequency is given by: 𝑓
𝑛 = 𝑛 ∗ 𝑢/𝑥. This model predicts multiple 
discrete whistling frequencies and can explain the different density gas observations in [3] (see 
Experimental Procedures). Furthermore, this model produces stable whistle frequencies only within a 
  
4 
narrow range of flow conditions, approximately when d/x ≤ St < 1, where St is the Strouhal number 
70 
𝑆𝑡 = 𝑓
𝑛 ∗ 𝑑/𝑢, with d the effective jet diameter.  
To test this model we systematically changed jet speed u by altering subglottal pressure and 
impingement length x with a metal plate after thyroid removal in four larynges. We could induce 
whistles that exhibited stable whistling modes, jumps between modes, and concurrent modes in all four 
larynges. The modal frequencies were accurately predicted by our model (Fig 1F), providing strong 
75 
support for our hypothesis that USVs are produced by a jet impinging on a planar wall. 
What exact mechanism constitutes the feedback remains unknown; it could be either upstream 
propagating acoustic disturbances through the core of the jet, or outside of the jet, or some edge effect 
[7,8]. Furthermore, we currently cannot accurately predict which modes are stable and what triggers 
jumps; the exact St values where modes are stable depends on the shear boundary layer properties at the 
80 
jet exit [8, 9]. We speculate jumps occur with sudden changes in jet speed as potentially found during 
higher states of attention/arousal [10]. 
Our model predicts that stable modes are set by jet speed, effective diameter and distance from 
glottis to thyroid, parameters controlled by combinations of intrinsic laryngeal anatomy, and respiratory 
and laryngeal motor programs [6]. Our data therefore imply that the categorization of USV syllables 
85 
requires careful consideration, since current classifications in mice may represent random jumps 
between stable modes that do not necessary reflect specific motor commands. Furthermore, our results 
suggest that strain specific USVs or USV changes in mouse models of genetically linked human 
communication disorders, such as autism, stuttering, and dyspraxia, may be the result of altered 
laryngeal geometry as well as motor programs.

Experimental procedures  
140 
Subjects 
Because in vivo recordings have shown that female mice emit ultrasonic vocalizations with similar 
acoustic features as male mice [1], we used both males and females in our experiments. For in vitro 
experiments, 15 out of 17 larynges tested made ultrasonic sound. Of these 17 larynges tested, 10 were 
adult BALB (male n = 4, female n = 6), 5 were adult C57 (male n = 4, female n = 1), and 2 were adult 
145 
NMRI (female n = 2) mice from Taconic Europe, Denmark. Detailed video and acoustic analysis was 
conducted on 8 adult BALB (male n = 4, female n = 4) and 1 adult NMRI (male n = 1) mice. Of these 
larynges, in vivo recordings were recorded from 2 BALB males. All experiments were conducted at the 
University of Southern Denmark in accordance with the Danish Animal Experiments Inspectorate 
(Copenhagen, Denmark).

Excised larynx preparation 
Mice were euthanized with isoflurane and the larynx, trachea, lower jaw and tongue were dissected, 
flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then maintained at -80 C until just prior to the experiment. At the 
start of each experiment, tissue was thawed in refrigerated ringer’s solution [2] and the lower jaw, 
155 
tongue, esophagus, hyoid, fat, and oropharynx were removed. The exterior, ventral, and dorsal views of 
each larynx were photographed with a Leica DC425 mounted on a stereomicroscope (M165-FC, Leica 
Microsystems). The trachea and attached larynx were fixed on a blunted 19G needle using 10-0 
monofilament suture. Care was taken that the end of the needle was greater than 0.5 mm from the caudal 
end of cricothyroid muscles. The arytenoids were held in place by two micromanipulators, but also 
160 
without these USVs were readily elicited and all recordings were done with the larynx in resting 
  
9 
position, i.e. without additional adduction of the arytenoids. Tissue was kept moist during the 
experiment with Ringer’s solution.  
Once secured onto the needle, the trachea and larynx were set upright onto a custom made 
apparatus with computer controlled air delivery system. Air driven through the larynx was pressure 
165 
controlled, humidified, and temperature monitored (temperatures ranged from 22 – 30°C) as described 
in detail in [3]. We subjected the larynx to an increasing and decreasing pressure ramp from 0-2 kPa in 4 
s. Tracheal mass flow was measured with MEMS flow sensors (PMF series, Posifa Microsystems, San 
Jose, USA) and a response time of 1 ms. To our knowledge no calibrated subglottal pressure or tracheal 
mass flow measurements during in vivo USV production are available for mice, but we consider the 
170 
applied 0-2 kPa range physiologically relevant, because (1) in rats subglottal pressure ranges from 0-2 
kPa during in vivo USV production [4,5], (2) in similarly sized birds subsyringeal pressures during song 
and induced sound production range from 0-3 kPa [3,6-8], and (3) increasing subglottal pressure above 3 
kPa in vitro lead to a substantial increase of acoustic noise suggesting that the upper limit for stable 
mode production was reached. The applied subglottal pressure ramps resulted in tracheal mass flow of 
175 
0-4 ml/s (Fig 1C). During quiet respiration in rats, tracheal mass flow is 15-20 ml/s/kg [9]. Extrapolating 
these values to a mouse of 20 gr would suggest a tracheal mass flow during quiet respiration of 0.3-0.4 
ml/s, which is below, and thus consistent with, the observed phonation threshold flow of 1 ml/s in Fig 
1C. 
Sound was recorded with a 1/4 inch pressure microphone-pre-amplifier assembly (model 46BD, 
180 
G.R.A.S., Denmark), amplified and high-pass filtered (10 Hz, 3-pole Butterworth filter, model 12AQ, 
G.R.A.S., Denmark). The microphone sensitivity was measured before each experiment (sound 
calibrator model 42AB, G.R.A.S., Denmark).  The microphone was placed at 22-24 mm away from the 
mounted larynx in the acoustic near field, and on a 90° angle to avoid the air jet from the tracheal outlet. 
  
10 
Microphone, pressure and flow signals were low-pass filtered at 100, 10 and 10 kHz, respectively 
185 
(custom-built filter) and digitized at 250 kHz (USB 6259, 16 bit, National Instruments, Austin, Texas). 
All control and analysis software was written in Matlab. 
The laryngeal glottal opening was imaged with a light-sensitive 16 bit high-speed camera 
(Fastcam SA1, Photron, San Diego, CA, USA; 100,000 frames/s) mounted on a stereomicroscope 
(M165-FC, Leica Microsystems) and illuminated by a plasma light source (HPLS200, Thorlabs, 
190 
Germany) through liquid light guides. The glottis consisted of the cartilaginous glottis between the 
arytenoids, and never reached into the membranous vocal fold portion. Due to the large amounts of data 
collected when imaging at 100,000 fr/sec we typically recorded 1-2 seconds. 
We developed an algorithm for automated parameter extraction of projected glottal area and 
width per frame. After finding the glottal shape in each frame by Canny edge detection, the midline of 
195 
the glottis was defined as the major axes orientation of a fitted ellipsoid to the extracted shape. Glottal 
width (i.e. arytenoid abduction times two) was calculated as the maximum of the perpendicular distance 
between the midline and all points along the glottal shape. Due to the downward ~45° angle of the 
glottis with the stereomicroscope’s objective (see Fig 1A), the actual glottal area was about  
[1/cos(45°)=] 1.4 larger than the projected glottal area, and ranged from 0.1 to 0.45 mm2 between 
200 
preparations, resulting in jet speeds around 10-15 m/s. Glottal width was parallel to the objective and 
thus was correctly projected, and varied little within - but more between - preparations ranging from 36 
to 80 pixels (0.33 to 0.73 mm). With Canny edge detection we could in principle not detect vibration 
below a single pixel of 9.2 µm. To determine if we could detect smaller vibrations masked by noise, we 
also inspected high dynamic range spectrograms of the glottal width signal. Careful visual inspection of 
205 
our raw image data, played-back at various relevant speeds, and the spectrograms of glottal width did 
not reveal any motion at the frequencies of the USVs. Peak frequency in the glottal width signal was 
  
11 
finally determined by calculating power spectral density estimates of the glottal width of 500 
consecutive images using the periodogram method (zero padded to 512 points). The peak frequency 
always occurred at 0 Hz (Fig 1C). 
210 
We removed the epiglottis with a horizontal cut using micro-scissors. We subsequently cut slices 
of the cranial part of the thyroid until just above the vocal folds.  
 
Wall impinging jet model 
We derived our model from [10]. Resonance occurs when the feedback is in phase with the instability 
215 
waves in the jet. The phase of the feedback disturbance at frequency f is given by 2𝜋 ∙ (𝑓
𝑥
𝑢 + 𝑓
𝑥
𝑐), 
where x is the distance between the jet exit (glottis) and the planar wall, i.e. the impingement length, u is 
the mean convection speed of the coherent structures, approximated as jet exit speed, and 𝑐 is sound 
speed.  This feedback phase will be in phase with the initial disturbance if equal to 2𝜋 ∙ 𝑛, where n is an 
integer, and thus follows: 𝑛 = 𝑓
𝑛 (
𝑥
𝑐 +
𝑥
𝑢). Because 𝑢/𝑐 ≪  1, the whistling frequency is given by: 𝑓
𝑛 =
220 
𝑛 ∗ 𝑢/𝑥.  
Jumps between modes thus need not be harmonically related. If the n=1 mode is observed the 
steps would be harmonics. In Figure 1F for example, n=1 is not excited, and thus the whistling 
frequencies are not harmonically related. 
Our model predicts that the resonance frequencies are independent of the speed of sound if the 
225 
jet speed remains constant. However, generating a whistle with the same pressure difference (from sub- 
to supraglottal) in a gas with lower density 𝜌 results in a higher jet speed u that is inversely proportional 
to the square root of air density (𝑢 ∝ 1 √𝜌
⁄
). Thus, from our model (𝑓
𝑛 = 𝑛 ∗ 𝑢/𝑥) follows that the 
predicted frequency of the whistle is inversely proportional to the square root of density (𝑓
𝑛 ∝ 1 √𝜌
⁄
). 
However, a lower density gas also has a different speed of sound, which is also inversely proportional to 
230 
  
12 
the square root of density, because 𝑐 = √𝐾 𝜌
⁄ ∝ 1 √𝜌
⁄
, where K is an adiabatic constant. Thus, because 
both parameters are proportional to 1 √𝜌
⁄
, jet speed u and the speed of sound c are directly proportional 
to each other, i.e. 𝑓
𝑛 ∝ 𝑐. This relation explains Roberts' observations that rodent USV frequencies 
shifted upwards in heliox gas with an increased speed of sound compared to normal air [11].  
Varying jet speed u between 0-20 m/s at a fixed impingent length x of 2 mm results already in a 
235 
wide range of predicted frequencies up to 80 kHz for modes 1-8 (Figure S2A), and up to 160 kHz for 
x=1 mm. Recently it was shown that the USVs produced in vivo can have a wider range (20-100 kHz) 
[12] than the previously accepted range of 30-100 kHz [13] and our model thus covers the frequency 
range found both in our in vitro as well as in vivo observations.  
 
240 
 
Modulating impingement length  
Mice probably only have a limited range to modulate the distance between glottis and thyroid 
wall, i.e. impingement length x. Most of the frequency modulation will therefore likely be driven by 
changes in jet speed u, by changing mass flow and glottis shape. Therefore we reasoned that changing 
245 
laryngeal impingement length experimentally would provide further support for our model.  
To modulate jet impingement length after thyroid removal, a 4x2 mm metal plate made out of a 
flattened 19G needle was placed at the original position of the thyroid (Figure S2B). The precise 
position and motion of this plate was controlled with an ergometer (Model 300C, Aurora Scientific, 
Ontario, Canada), which measured displacement at the tip of the lever arm (displacement resolution 1 
250 
µm). The larynges were placed in the setup as described above with a constant jet speed (10-30 ml/s) in 
combination with no movement, or sinusoidal movement of the plate.  
  
13 
To determine the impingement length x, we quantified the exact position of the plate and glottal 
opening by filming the larynx with a high-speed camera (MotionPro-X4, 12 bit CMOS sensor, IDT; 500 
frames/s) simultaneously from the top and side by placing a 5x5x5 mm 45˚ angled aluminium surface-
255 
coated prism (Thorlabs, Newton, New Jersey, US) next to the larynx. Because the plate often obscured 
the glottal opening only the side views were used for extraction of plate position and impingement 
length.  To calculate the exact position of the plate (wall) and glottal opening (jet exit) we cross-
correlated regions of interest containing only the plate or larynx with the entire image. We used linear 
interpolation to position the peak in the cross-correlation at a precision of 2.54 µm.  
260 
 
The mean convection speed of the coherent structures is approximated as jet exit speed u, which 
we calculated as the measured tracheal mass flow divided by glottal area. Because we could not directly 
measure glottal area in this experiment, we needed to fit the area to obtain the measured sound 
frequency traces. In all four larynges the area was 0.2 – 0.4 mm2, values that corresponded well with 
values observed in the intact excised larynx experiments (0.1 – 0.45 mm2).  
265 
 
In vivo vocalization recordings 
USVs emitted in the presence of a familiar female mouse were recorded from two adult (>100 days) 
male mice prior to in vitro experiments. The females were devocalized by unilateral nerve cut [14]. Mice 
were placed into a standard acrylic cage located within a single walled attenuating chamber. USVs were 
270 
recorded with a ½ inch G.R.A.S. (type 26AC) high frequency microphone placed 10 cm above the cage 
floor. The acoustic signals were amplified and digitized by an Avisoft Bioacoustics amplifier at a 
sampling rate of 250 kHz and 16-bit resolution.  
 
  
14 
USV Analysis 
275 
Acoustic parameters of all in vitro and in vivo USVs were analyzed using Avisoft SASLab Pro software 
(Avisoft Bioacoustics), as described in detail in [15]. USVs were automatically detected by the software 
when energy was above a certain threshold, bounded by > - 2 ms of silence, minimum duration of 1 ms, 
and hold time of 20 ms. For each USV, the minimum, maximum, and mean peak frequencies were 
extracted from spectrograms of each USV (Hamming window, 1024 FFT length, 100% frame size, 85% 
280 
temporal overlap). Because maximum peak frequencies were measured from the highest frequency bin 
of the detected signal, USVs with multiple modes had higher max frequencies than those with only one 
mode.

Figure S1. USVs and UVs produced by the excised larynx in vitro correspond well to in vivo USVs. 
A) Exemplary spectrograms of in vivo (top) and in vitro USVs (bottom) (FFT length: 1024, overlap: 
75%, Hamming window; dynamic range: 20 dB) B) Minimum and mean peak frequency of USV and f-
5!
USV were not significantly different (Student’s T-Test; P > 0.01), while max frequency was greater in 
the in vivo prep (Student’s T-Test; P< 0.01). Blue colored circles represent sound repetitions from one 
animal and pink from another animal from in vivo and in vitro conditions.

Figure S2. Testing frequency mode predictions of the planar wall impinging jet model. A) Surface 
plot of predicted whistle frequencies as function of jet flow and impingement length. Only modes n=2, 
4, 6, and 8 are shown for clarity. B) Sideview (movie still) of thyroid replacement experiment showing 
the extracted boundary of plate (red line) that was positioned by cross-correlating the plate (red shading) 
with the image. The white dot indicates the subpixel position of the center of the plate sub-image used 
15!
for cross-correlation. The green dot is the estimated exit position of the glottal jet. The upper part of the 
thyroid is cut away. Pixel resolution in the original image was 25.4 µm.
