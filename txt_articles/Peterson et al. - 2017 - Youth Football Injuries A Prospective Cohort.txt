Investigation performed at University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA
Background: There are approximately 2.8 million youth football players between the ages of 7 and 14 years in the United States.
Rates of injury in this population are poorly described. Recent studies have reported injury rates between 2.3% and 30.4% per
season and between 8.5 and 43 per 1000 exposures.
Hypothesis: Youth flag football has a lower injury rate than youth tackle football. The concussion rates in flag football are lower
than in tackle football.
Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.
Methods: Three large youth (grades 2-7) football leagues with a total of 3794 players were enrolled. Research personnel partnered
with the leagues to provide electronic attendance and injury reporting systems. Researchers had access to deidentified player data
and injury information. Injury rates for both the tackle and flag leagues were calculated and compared using Poisson regression
with a log link. The probability an injury was severe and an injury resulted in a concussion were modeled using logistic regression.
For these 2 responses, best subset model selection was performed, and the model with the minimum Akaike information criterion
value was chosen as best. Kaplan-Meier curves were examined to compare time loss due to injury for various subgroups of the
population. Finally, time loss was modeled using Cox proportional hazards regression models.
Results: A total of 46,416 exposures and 128 injuries were reported. The mean age at injury was 10.64 years. The hazard ratio for
tackle football (compared with flag football) was 0.45 (95% CI, 0.25-0.80; P ¼ .0065). The rate of severe injuries per exposure for
tackle football was 1.1 (95% CI, 0.33-3.4; P ¼ .93) times that of the flag league. The rate for concussions in tackle football per
exposure was 0.51 (95% CI, 0.16-1.7; P ¼ .27) times that of the flag league.
Conclusion: Injury is more likely to occur in youth flag football than in youth tackle football. Severe injuries and concussions were
not significantly different between leagues. Concussion was more likely to occur during games than during practice. Players in the
sixth or seventh grade were more likely to suffer a concussion than were younger players.

Recently, the safety of youth football has been brought
into question in the popular media.2 Flag football has
been proposed to be a safer alternative to tackle football.
However, injury rates in youth football remain poorly
described. Previous studies on youth football injuries have
been conducted on small samples (n < 1000 athletes) or
suffered from methodological limitations. In order to bet-
ter understand the risk of injury in youth football, there is
a need for a larger study to determine the types of injuries
suffered by youth football players, injury incidence, the
risk factors associated with these injuries, and whether
flag football is indeed a safer alternative to tackle football
for young players. A recent American Academy of Pediat-
rics Policy Statement on tackling in youth football recom-
mended nontackling leagues should be expanded.4 We
hypothesize that youth flag football has a lower injury rate
than youth tackle football.
In the United States, approximately 2.8 million youth
between the ages of 6 and 14 years participate in youth
football each year.2 Sport-related injuries are the leading

 cause of injury among children and adolescents.3 Previous
studies of youth football have suffered from inaccurate esti-
mates of athletic exposure and varied definitions of injury.
This is reflected in the large variability in reported injury
epidemiology between studies. Recent studies report injury
rates between 2.3% and 38.2% per season.2,6-8,10,12,18-22
Games resulted in 8.5 to 43 injuries per 1000 exposures, and
practices had 1 to 13.5 injuries per 1000 exposures. Overall
for games and practices combined, these studies showed 2 to
17.8 injuries per 1000 exposures.6,12-16,20,21 Despite these
variations, it is likely that the risk of injury is higher in
youth football than in other popular youth sports, including
basketball, soccer, wrestling, and gymnastics.16,22
The most commonly reported injures in youth football are
fractures, sprains, strains, and contusions. The rates of frac-
turehavebeenthe mostconsistentbetween studies,with27%
to 35% of reported injuries being fractures. Injuries with
more subjective diagnostic criteria, such as sprains, strains,
andcontusions,havesufferedfrommorevariabilityinreport-
ing,with9% to69% ofreportedinjuriesbeingsprains,strains,
and contusions.2,8,10,14,15,18-21 Players in grades 7 and 8
have almost twice the injury risk when compared with
players in grades 4, 5, and 6.12 In studies in which athlete-
exposures were measured, the injury risk in older and more
experienced athletes could be attributed to the more experi-
enced players’ increased playing time. Interestingly, youth
football players with more advanced sexual maturity ratings
have been shown to have a higher risk for injury.10,11,17
Sport-related concussion has gained widespread atten-
tion in the popular media and scientific literature. Previous
studies of youth football have identified remarkably few
concussions compared with other levels of play. However,
Kontos et al9 recently reported on a cohort of 468 youth
football players with rates of concussion comparable to high
school and collegiate football players. USA Football reports
a concussion incidence in youth football of nearly 4%.2 Addi-
tionally, Daniel et al5 recently reported on accelerometer-
instrumented helmet-based measurements of collisions
during youth football. Youth football players experienced
fewer impacts per season. On average, these collisions were
less forceful than those in high school and collegiate athletes.
However, the top 5% of reported collisions were almost as
forceful as the highest-force collisions seen in high school
and collegiate players. Most of the highest-force impacts
occurred during practice rather than during a game. This
is in opposition to previous epidemiologic studies, which
have shown up to a 10-fold greater risk of concussion in
youth football games when compared with practice.
We hypothesize that youth flag football has a lower
injury rate than youth tackle football. We also hypothesize
that concussion rates in flag football will be lower than in
tackle football.
METHODS
Participants
Three youth football leagues (2 tackle leagues and 1 flag
league) with a total of 3794 players (3525 tackle football
players and 269 flag football players) participated in this
prospective cohort study. Tackle league A contained 43
teams, and all 43 teams reported at least 1 data point.
Tackle league B contained 124 teams, and only 72 teams
reported at least 1 data point. The flag football league con-
tained 20 teams, and 18 teams reported at least 1 data
point. Leagues were enrolled and provided with technical
assistance. Individual athletes were not enrolled in the
study. Specifically, the research team provided the leagues
with an online database to monitor player attendance at
practices and games. The database also provided leagues
with an injury reporting system for tracking injuries and
loss of playing time according to their league’s policies and
procedures. Deidentified data elements were extracted
from the online database and used for this analysis.
Tackle and flag football differ in their equipment and in
how they determine the end of a down. In tackle football,
players are allowed to wear pads and helmets, but in flag
football, pads and helmets are not allowed and players
must wear a belt around their waist with 3 flags. In tackle
football, the end of a down is defined when the ball carrier’s
forward progress is halted and not resumed, the ball carrier
is forced to go out of bounds, or when a body part other than
hands or feet touch the ground. In flag football, the end of a
down is defined when a player runs out of bounds or when 1
of 3 flags is pulled off a belt worn around the waist.
Measures and Procedures
Teams within each league documented player attendance
at practices and games and reported any injury that
resulted in the loss of playing time following their league’s
policies and procedures. These records contained person-
ally identifiable information, but no research team mem-
ber was able to access this personal information. Coaches
input their practice and competition attendance into an
online database provided by the research team. All injury
information was deidentified and reported to the research
team through the online database. Participation was mea-
sured with the date of the game or practice and attendance
and participation status. The date of each football game
and practice along with the number of players who partic-
ipated was recorded. These metrics were used to deter-
mine the total number of exposures. An exposure was
defined as a single game or practice where a player had
the potential to be injured (eg, a social gathering where
football was not practiced or played would not count as a
practice). Deidentified exposure information was avail-
able to the research team via the online database. The
research team’s deidentified database did assign injured
players a number in case the player was injured multiple
times. The total number of players per league was pro-
vided to the research team by the leagues based on their
registrations at the beginning of the season.
All injuries that resulted in loss of playing time were
included. The injury report contained information that
could be used to identify the injured player for the league’s
use. However, the online database used by the research
team excluded name, emergency contact, date of birth, tele-
phone number, and team. The leagues also had access to
2
Peterson et al
The Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine
 other information such as date of injury, type of play or
drill, location of injury, and description of injury, which was
not used by the research team. The deidentified injury
information used by the research team included the follow-
ing items: sex, age, grade, type of league (tackle vs flag),
setting (game vs practice), position on the field (quarter-
back, running back, linebacker, etc), type of injury (contact,
noncontact), number of days missed after injury, return to
play at any point (yes, no), and diagnosis.
Teams were instructed to complete this form after every
practice or competition. One person for each team was des-
ignated to input information into the database after each
practice or game. This person could be a coach, volunteer
parent, or team athletic trainer. The team designees were
provided with a tutorial on how to complete the online form
prior to the start of the season.
Data Analyses
Participation and injury report forms were used to calcu-
late injury rates. For each injury that occurred, we
abstracted the following variables: grade (dichotomized
into second through fifth and sixth through seventh), lea-
gue type (flag and tackle), setting (game or practice), team
(defense or offense), position (lineman or nonlineman), and
injury type (contact and noncontact injuries).
Grade was chosen instead of age because all the leagues
were organized by grade in school and not by age. Nearly all
injured players were age appropriate for their grade.
Injured players were within 1 year of age except 1 injured
fifth grader who was an extra year older than the remain-
ing fifth graders (12 years old instead of 10-11 years old).
Sex was not chosen as an analyzed variable because no
female players were injured. Positions were dichotomized
to lineman or nonlineman due to the limited number of
injuries, which occurred at each position. Tight ends were
considered nonlinemen. Contact injuries were defined as
any injury sustained due to impact with another player,
regardless of whether the injury occurred while playing
flag or tackle football. An injury was considered noncontact
if it occurred without an external force exhibited by another
player, such as those experienced during a running drill.
An injury was considered severe if it resulted in a concus-
sion, fracture, or ligament tear. All other injuries were con-
sidered nonsevere. The leagues encouraged their teams to
use the International Consensus Statement Guidelines for
Sport-Related Concussion.13
Poisson regression with a log link was used to compare
overall injury rates, concussion rates, and severe injury
rates in the tackle and flag leagues. The model for each
league type was log(mi) ¼ log(Ei) þ Li, where mi is the mean
number of injuries for the given league type, Ei is the
number of exposures, and Li is a league type–specific indi-
cator. The numerator of the ratio estimates is the rate in
the flag league and the denominator is the rate in the
tackle league. The 95% CIs and corresponding P values
were also calculated.
Multivariable logistic regression was employed to fit
models for concussion status and whether an injury was
severe. To determine which model was best in predicting
both response variables of interest, all subsets of predictors
were considered and the model with the smallest Akaike
information criterion (AIC) value was used.1 Only the main
effects were considered as possible predictors in this model
selection procedure, but this assumption was verified by
using the deviance statistic to assess whether any interac-
tion terms were needed in the models. Demographic infor-
mation was only available for players who sustained an
injury. The analyses were conditioned such that an injury
had occurred. For instance, we were able to model the prob-
ability that an injury was severe but we were unable to
determine the probability of sustaining a severe injury.
The final analysis involved determining which predictors
were important in characterizing the number of days until
an injured player returned. Only 100 of the 128 injuries
were used in these analyses due to either inconsistent cod-
ing of exposure data (19 players) or the player being injured
on the final day of the season (9 players). Of the 100 injuries
used, the player’s date of return was recorded in 83
instances. For the remaining 17 injuries, the player either
did not return before the end of the season or the coach
stopped reporting before the season ended. In these 17
instances, the variable’s value was considered to be cen-
sored, and we recorded the value of this variable to be the
difference between the last day of recording and the date of
injury. These censored data are taken into account in the
time to event analysis.
For each predictor of interest, Kaplan-Meier curves were
constructed displaying the probability a player’s injury
would still cause the player to be unable to participate a
given number of days after the injury occurred. Cox propor-
tional hazards regression was used to fit models predicting
the amount of time a player would lose to an injury. To
determine which model was best in predicting a player’s
time loss, we used forward and backward model selection
techniques at significance levels of .05 and .10. The follow-
ing were possible predictors in the final model: grade,
league type, setting, team, position, injury type, injury
severity, and concussion status. Note that only included
main effects were included as possible predictors. Finally,
for the predictors chosen in the final model, time-dependent
covariates were tested to assess the validity of the propor-
tional hazards assumption.
RESULTS
All 3 leagues had a total of 46,416 exposures where an
injury could have occurred. Of the 46,416 exposures, there
were a total of 128 injuries, representing 121 different
players. The players who were injured ranged from 8 to
13 years of age, with a mean age of 10.6 years and a median
age of 11 years. The overall injury rate was 2.76 injuries per
1000 exposures. Of the 128 injuries, 65 were considered
severe. Of the 65 severe injuries, 33 were classified as con-
cussions. Table 1 presents the number of exposures, inju-
ries, severe injuries, and concussions by league type.
Of the 128 injuries, 54 happened to players on defense
and 74 on offense. Of the 54 defensive injuries, 44 occurred
in the tackle leagues and 10 in the flag league. Of the 74

 offensive injuries, 71 happened in tackle leagues and 3
occurred in the flag league. Of the 128 injures, 37 happened
to lineman and 91 to nonlineman. All 37 injuries to lineman
happened in the tackle leagues. Of the 91 nonlineman inju-
ries, 78 happened in tackle leagues and 13 were in the flag
league.
Overall injury rates, severe injury rates, and concussion
rates were compared between flag and tackle leagues. The
results are shown in Table 2.
Using both forward and backward model selection
techniques, the best model for predicting whether an
injury was severe included only league type as a predic-
tor. The predicted probability that an injury is severe is
presented in Table 3.
The best model for predicting whether an injury pro-
duced a concussion included the predictors setting and
grade. Note all concussions occurred on contact plays, so
this predictor was excluded from analyses. The estimated
probability an injury resulted in a concussion for each com-
bination of grade and setting is presented in Table 4.
Kaplan-Meier curves displaying time loss for each
predictor of interest were created and are displayed in Fig-
ures 1 through 4. Figure 1 compares the number of days a
player from the tackle league sat out due to their injury
versus a player in the flag league. Figure 2 shows the
difference in the amount of time players who had severe
injuries sat out versus players with minor injuries. Figure 3
splits the severe injuries from Figure 2 into severe noncon-
cussed injuries and severe concussion-related injuries.
Figure 4 combines the minor injuries and severe noncon-
cussed injuries to compare concussion injuries to all
nonconcussion-related injuries.
The final analyses determined which predictors were
important in characterizing how long a player’s injury
forced the player to sit out. The best model for predicting
how long a player’s injury caused the player to sit out
included both league type and injury severity. Neither lea-
gue type nor injury severity showed significant deviations

DISCUSSION
Our first objective was to determine whether flag football
had lower injury rates than youth tackle football. The
injury rate found in the youth flag league is significantly
higher than the injury rate in youth tackle football (P ¼
.0065). Therefore, we reject our initial hypothesis. The
higher injury rate in flag football could be due to a number
of factors. Flag football players do not wear protective
equipment like tackle football players. There are differ-
ences in the mechanics of play. Tackle football has signifi-
cant contact with blocking, but flag football involves
players running and diving for flags. This may also repre-
sent an intrinsic difference between the participants in
youth flag football and the participants in youth tackle
football.
Injury rates measured similar to what had previously
been reported. Other studies found overall injury rates per
1000 exposures ranged from 2 to 17.8 injuries per 1000
exposures.6,12-16,20,21 These studies were predominantly
looking at youth tackle football. The 2.60 injuries per
1000 exposures described in this study is slightly lower
than has been found in similar studies, but our study had
more players and more exposures than other studies. There
is no comparable literature that has evaluated injury rates
in youth flag football.
In comparing the injuries in tackle and flag football, time
to return to play after an injury was much longer in the
tackle leagues than in the flag leagues. This presents a
paradox in trying to determine which league type is ‘‘safer.’’
Tackle football players suffer fewer injuries, but the inju-
ries that do occur result in more lost playing time. There are
countless reasons why a player might sit out longer or
shorter from an injury. However, there were no rules or
other systematic reasons that would have affected this at
the league level. Individual teams can even have different
policies and procedures.
The imminent probability a player will return from an
injury on any day (given he or she has not returned to play
already) is 9.505 times higher for a player in the flag league
than a player in the tackle league (P < .0001) (Table 5). That
is, for a given practice or game, an injured player in the flag
football league is almost 10 times as likely to return to play
than a player in a tackle football league. The imminent
probability a player will return from their injuries is
1.610 times higher for a player whose injuries are minor.
These data serve as an internal control for our model
because we expect players with minor injuries to return
to play more quickly than players with a severe injuries.

 Some research shows older players tend to have an
increased injury rate.4,6-8,10,12,14-15,20,22 Not all studies
agree with this assumption.18 The prominent age-related
finding of this study was a conditional risk of concussion by
grade and type of exposure for injured players (Table 4). For
athletes in fifth grade or lower and athletes in sixth grade
or higher, injuries sustained during games were almost
twice as likely to be a concussion than injuries sustained
during practice. Injuries were also more likely to be concus-
sions in older athletes than in younger athletes. Because of
the nature of the data collected, we are not concluding rates
of concussion were higher in games or in older athletes but
rather that among injured youth football players, being
older and playing in a game increases the chances the
injury is a concussion.
The second main objective was to compare the concussion
rates of tackle football and flag football. There was a trend
toward a higher concussion rate in the flag league than in
the tackle leagues, but this result is based on only 3 con-
cussions in the flag league and is not statistically signifi-
cant. Interestingly, despite the fact that flag football is
supposed to be a noncontact sport, all concussions occurred
during contact with another player.
Concussions were also analyzed by looking at the time
to return to play. Players with concussions and those
with severe nonconcussed injuries had a similar propor-
tion of players return to play within 10 days (Figure 3).
However, all concussed players returned to play within
20 days, while not all of the severely injured noncon-
cussed players returned by 20 days. Severely injured
players who were not concussed tended to be less likely
to quickly return from their injuries than players who
had concussions.
For the first 15 days after an injury occurs, a non-
concussed player is more likely to return from an injury
than a concussed player, but after that time, a concussed
player is more likely to return than a nonconcussed player
(Figure 4). This is logical as the majority of players return-
ing the first 15 days would be the nonconcussed players
with minor injuries. After 15 days, most of the remaining
injuries would be in nonconcussed patients with severe
injuries (like a ligament tear or a fracture) that needed
much more time to heal before returning to play.
Limitations
The biggest limitation of this study is that player-specific
variables were only recorded if the player was injured. This
limits the degree to which injury types and severity can be
described by demographic information such as age, sex,
position, and so on. For this reason, analysis of concussion
by grade and setting (Table 4) is limited to the condition of
injury. That is, only the conditional probability of an injury
being a concussion can be reported given that they are
injured, in a specific age range, and participating in a spe-
cific setting. For example, the specific rates of concussion
among fifth grade linemen during practice cannot be
reported because the denominator is unknown (the pool of
athletes who fit this description and can be injured at a
given event). Only the total number of athletes partici-
pating is known and whether they are in the tackle or flag
league.
A second limitation is that this study is dependent on
semivoluntary attendance and injury reporting. Each lea-
gue requires their coaches to collect attendance and report
any injuries to the league. Our partnership with the lea-
gues has made the process easier for the team personnel
than it was before we provided electronic infrastructure,
but there may still be variability between coaches and team
personnel in attendance and injury reporting. Also, ‘‘non-
medical’’ personnel reported the injuries based on who was
designated by the team. Some teams had athletic trainers
who filled out the injury reports, but other coaches and staff
did not have a way of confirming the diagnosis with physi-
cians or athletic trainers.

 Another limitation is players and their parents self-
select what league they participate in. Parents of flag foot-
ball players may be concerned about possible injuries and
selected flag football based on personal safety bias. If that is
the case, they may be more inclined to report injuries when
others may not.
Finally, the number of injuries seen in the flag football
league was relatively small, and the number of partici-
pants in the flag league was much smaller than the num-
ber of participants in the tackle leagues. For these
reasons, the comparisons made between leagues are
somewhat limited.
CONCLUSION
Rates of injury in youth football are relatively low. Youth
flag football has a higher injury rate than tackle football. A
significantly different rate of severe injury or concussion
between tackle and flag football was not identified, but
players did return to play more slowly after an injury in
the tackle leagues than they did in the flag league. Further-
more, we cannot conclude that youth flag football is a safer
alternative to youth tackle football. The higher injury rate
in flag football needs to be considered when determining
the relative safety of flag football and tackle football.
Future safety analyses should include looking at injury
rates, severity, type of injury, lost time, and future conse-
quences of injury.
