Butterfly eyes are furnished with a variety of photoreceptors of different spectral
sensitivities often in species-specific manner. We have conducted an extensive
comparative study to address the question of how their spectrally complex retinas
evolved. Here we investigated the structure and function of the eye of the common
bluebottle butterfly (Graphium sarpedon), using electrophysiological, anatomical, and
molecular approaches. Intracellular electrophysiology revealed that the eye contains
photoreceptors of 15 distinct spectral sensitivities. These can be divided into six spectral
receptor classes: ultraviolet—(UV), violet— (V), blue—(B), blue–green—(BG), green—(G),
and red—(R) sensitive. The B, G, and R classes respectively contain three, four, and five
subclasses. Fifteen is the record number of spectral receptors so far reported in a single
insect eye. We localized these receptors by injecting dye into individual photoreceptors
after recording their spectral sensitivities. We thus found that four of them are confined
to the dorsal region, eight to the ventral, and three exist throughout the eye; the ventral
eye region is spectrally richer than the dorsal region. We also identified mRNAs encoding
visual pigment opsins of one ultraviolet, one blue, and three long wavelength-absorbing
types. Localization of these mRNAs by in situ hybridization revealed that the dorsal
photoreceptors each express a single opsin mRNA, but more than half of the ventral
photoreceptors coexpress two or three L opsin mRNAs. This expression pattern well
explains the spectral organization of the Graphium compound eye.

INTRODUCTION
Butterflies and moths often have sophisticated color vision (Kelber and Pfaff, 1999; Kinoshita et al.,
1999; Kelber et al., 2002). Their color vision appears to have evolved from an ancestral trichromatic
system based on the ultraviolet-, blue-, and green-sensitive photoreceptors (Menzel and Backhaus,
1989; Peitsch et al., 1992; Lin, 1993; Skorupski and Chittka, 2010; Blackiston et al., 2011). The
system subsequently elaborated by adding photoreceptors of various spectral sensitivities, most
likely by positive selection of duplicated visual pigment opsins (Briscoe et al., 2010). Recent
studies indicate that the suite of photoreceptor sensitivities varies extensively between butterfly
species. For example, the Japanese yellow swallowtail, Papilio xuthus (tribe Papilionini, family
Papilionidae), has six classes of spectral receptors, which are of the ultraviolet (UV), violet (V), blue
(B), green (G), red (R), and broadband (BB) classes (Arikawa, 2003), while the small white butterfly,
 Chen et al.
Spectral Receptors in the Eye of Graphium Butterfly
Pieris rapae, has UV, V, B, G, R, and dark red (DR) receptors. The
spectral sensitivities are even sexually dimorphic in some cases:
the V receptors of P. rapae exist only in females, and the males
instead have double-peaked B receptors (Arikawa et al., 2005).
The richest variety of spectral receptors reported to date
in the animal kingdom is found in the eyes of reef-dwelling
stomatopods or mantis shrimps, which have up to 16 classes
of receptors (Cronin, 2006). Until now, the golden birdwing,
Troides aeacus (Troidini, Papilionidae) held the record among
insects, with nine classes (Chen et al., 2013). Why is the spectral
organization of eyes so different? Are these animals hexa-, nona-,
or even hexadeca-chromatic? What is the mechanism underlying
their color vision? To address such questions, we have adopted a
comparative approach.
Graphium is a large genus common in Australasian regions.

vision.
The
common
bluebottle,
Graphium sarpedon (Leptocercini, Papilionidae) has wings with
a conspicuous mid-band with blue–green colored patches. The
physics of the wing coloration has been extensively studied, and
have been found to be quite complicated where angle-dependent
iridescence is involved because of a unique type of flattened
scales (Stavenga et al., 2010). The elaborate wing coloration must
be crucial for visual signaling but information about their vision
is limited (Eguchi et al., 1982). Here we studied the spectral
organization of their compound eyes, and to our surprise, we
found photoreceptors of at least 15 different spectral sensitivities
in their eyes. We confirmed the validity of the finding by
localizing this extensive collection of photoreceptor classes in the
retina.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Adult common bluebottle butterflies G. sarpedon nipponum were
collected around Sokendai, Kanagawa, Japan. The butterflies
were fed daily with sucrose solution and were used for
experiments within 3 days of capture. We here present the results
of males only, because it was difficult to obtain enough number
of females for the study. We used about 200 male individuals in
total.
To identify mRNAs encoding visual pigment opsins, we used
the eyes of 10 papilionid species including G. sarpedon. The
other nine species were Luehdorfia japonica and Luehdorfia
puziloi (gifts from Mr. Isao Nihira), Sericinus montela (from
Prof. Yoshiomi Kato), Atrophaneura alcinous and Papilio
machaon (collected around Sokendai), Pachliopta aristolochiae,
(collected in Okinawa), Graphium macleyanum and Papilio
anactus (collected in Canberra Australia), and T. aeacus
formosanus (obtained from individuals after the completion of
electrophysiological experiments reported in Chen et al., 2013).
Electrophysiology and Dye Injection
Photoreceptor
spectral
sensitivities
were
determined
by
intracellular electrophysiology. A butterfly whose wings and legs
had been removed was mounted on a stage. A chlorinated silver
wire was inserted into the stump of an antenna as the reference
electrode. A hole covering about 10–20 facets was made in
the dorsal region of the eye, in order to insert the recording
microelectrode. The eye was then positioned at the center of a
Cardan arm perimeter device, inside a Faraday cage.
A glass microelectrode filled with 10 mM Alexa fluor 568
(excitation/emission at 578/603 nm) dissolved in 1 M KCl or
4% lucifer yellow CH (excitation/emission at 428/536 nm), with
resistance about 60–100 M�, was inserted into the retina. The
stimulus light was provided by a 500 W xenon arc lamp through
one of 22 narrow-band interference filters at 20 nm intervals from
300 to 740 nm. The light was guided through a quartz optical fiber
creating a light source of about 1.56◦ diameter from the animal’s
perspective. The fiber was mounted on the perimeter device and
positioned on the optical axis of the ommatidium containing
the cell being penetrated. Photoreceptor spectral responses were
recorded by applying a series of equiquantal monochromatic
flashes sweeping from short to long wavelength and back
again. Flashes lasted 30 ms and were separated by 1 s intervals.
Polarization responses were also recorded at the wavelength
that gave the maximal response, by rotating a UV-transparent
polarization filter in front of the fiber: 0◦ was defined as the
direction of the animal’s dorso-ventral axis. Then the response–
light intensity (V–log I) function was recorded over a 4 log unit
intensity range at the peak wavelength. Only when the maximal
response was over 30 mV in amplitude was the recording
accepted. The recorded V–log I data were fitted to the Naka-
Rushton function: V/Vmax = In/(In + Kn), where I is the stimulus
intensity, V is the response amplitude, Vmax is the maximum
response amplitude, K is the stimulus intensity eliciting 50% of
Vmax, and n is the exponential slope. The V–log I function was
used to convert the V-values measured in the spectral series into
photon numbers required to elicit the responses. The normalized
reciprocal of the relative photon numbers then yielded the
spectral and polarization sensitivities. Following the intracellular
recording, fluorescing dye was injected into the photoreceptor by
applying negative DC current of 2–3 nA for about 5 min.
Anatomy
The ommatidium containing the dye-injected receptor was
identified in vivo using an epi-fluorescence microscope (BX-60,
Olympus) under green (for Alexa fluor) or blue-violet (for lucifer
yellow) excitation. The ommatidial autofluorescence was also
observed under ultraviolet excitation to localize the ommatidium
containing the marked photoreceptor in the array of fluorescing
ommatidia.
After taking pictures under ultraviolet excitation, the eyes
were isolated and fixed in 4.0% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M
sodium cacodylate buffer (CB, pH 7.4) at room temperature for
30 min. After being dehydrated in an acetone series, the eyes
were infiltrated with propylene oxide, and then embedded in
Quetol 812 resin (Nisshin EM, Tokyo Japan). The eyes were
sectioned at a thickness of 10 µm using a rotary microtome.
The sections were first inspected under either green (for
Alexa fluor) or blue-violet excitation (for lucifer yellow) to
localize the marked photoreceptor within the ommatidium, and
subsequently, regular transmission illumination was used to

identify the color of the pigment clusters in the ommatidium
containing the marked cell. The electrophysiological data were
accepted only when a single photoreceptor was marked in this
preparation.
To reveal the ultrastructure of the rhabdom, the eyes were
prefixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2.0% paraformaldehyde
in 0.1 M CB at 4◦C overnight. The eyes were then post-fixed
with 2.0% OsO4 in 0.1 M CB for 2 h at room temperature,
block stained with 2% UrAc in 50% ethanol for 1 h, dehydrated
in ethanol series, infiltrated, and embedded in Spurr’s resin.
Ultrathin sections were double-stained with uranyl acetate and
lead citrate, and observed in a transmission electron microscope
(H7650, Hitachi, Tokyo).
Identification and Localization of Opsin
mRNAs
The eyes of 10 species of butterflies (see Section Animals)
were isolated and prepared for poly-A RNA extraction using
QuickPrep Micro mRNA Purification Kit (GE Healthcare,
Chalfont St Giles, UK). The extracted poly-A RNA was used to
obtain cDNA fragments encoding visual pigment opsins by RT-
PCR using degenerate primers based on consensus sequences
of lepidopteran opsins. The amplified opsin cDNA fragments
were purified using Quantum Prep Freeze’N Squeeze DNA
Gel Extraction Spin Columns (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA)
and then cloned using TOPO TA Cloning Kit Dual Promoter
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The clones were sequenced
using BigDye Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit and ABI
3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA). The complete cDNA sequences were determined by 5′-
and 3′-RACE methods.
Complete nucleotide sequences of the coding region were
aligned with other butterfly opsin cDNA sequences using
ClustalW
(http://www.megasoftware.net/)
with
opsins
of
Manduca sexta (Sphingidae, Lepidoptera) as the outgroup.
Transmembrane domains were predicted by the TMHMM
version
2.0
program
(http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/
TMHMM/).
Phylogenetic
trees
based
on
the
nucleotide
sequences were reconstructed using Bayesian inference methods
(BI) coupled with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm
executed in MrBayes 3.1.2 (http://mrbayes.csit.fsu.edu/), and
also by using the maximum likelihood method (ML) executed
in PhyML 3.0 with the General Term- Reversible (GTR)
substitution model (http://atgc.lirmm.fr/phyml/). The resulting
dendrograms were virtually identical, and the ones made using
the BI method are shown in Figure 2. The reliabilities of the
phylogenetic trees were tested using posterior probabilities based
on 500,000 replicate analyses (for BI) or 1000 bootstrap replicates
(for ML).
For localizing the opsin mRNAs in the Graphium retina
by in situ hybridization, isolated eyes were immersed in 4%
paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.2) and
then microwave-irradiated for 5 s six times (total 30 s). After
further incubation in the fixative for 20 min at 4◦C, the eyes
were dehydrated in ethanol series followed by 100% terpineol,
and infiltrated with xylene. The eyes were then embedded
in Paraplast (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) and sectioned at
8–10 µm thickness. Serial sections mounted on a slide were
deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated through an ethanol
series backwards. The rehydrated sections were treated for 4 min
with proteinase K at 37◦C and then for 10 min with 0.25% acetic
acid with 0.1% triethanolamine at room temperature.
Probes for in situ hybridization were designed to hybridize
to approximately 200 bases of the mRNAs at the non-coding
region downstream of the 3′ terminus. Corresponding cDNA
regions were first subcloned into pCRII-TOPO vector, and
digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled cRNAs were then generated using a
DIG-RNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). The absence of
cross hybridization was confirmed by dot blot analysis. Sections
were dehydrated in ethanol and dried at 57◦C for 1 h, and were
then treated with hybridization solution containing 0.5 µg ml−1
cRNA probe at 65◦C overnight. The probes were visualized by
anti-DIG immunohistochemistry (DIG nucleic acid detection kit,
Boehringer Mannheim).
RESULTS
Ommatidial Heterogeneity
Light and electron microscopic histology reveals that G. sarpedon
ommatidia each contain nine photoreceptor cells, R1–9. Four
of them, R1–4, are the distal photoreceptors, contributing their
microvilli to the distal tier of the rhabdom. The proximal tier
of the rhabdom is composed of the microvilli of the proximal
photoreceptors, R5–8. R9 is the basal photoreceptor, adding
some microvilli at the base of the rhabdom (Figure 1). The
entire length of an ommatidium from the corneal surface to the
basement membrane is about 900 µm in the frontal region of the
eye (where the retina is thickest).
We can divide ommatidia into three types (I, II, and III)
according to the intensity of ultraviolet-induced autofluorescence
in intact eyes (Figure 1B): the fluorescence is either undetectable
(type I), strong (type II), or weak (type III). This fluorescence is
only observed in ommatidia of the ventral eye region. The dorsal
region has no fluorescence, unlike in P. xuthus and T. aeacus,
where the cornea fluoresces dorsally (Arikawa et al., 1999a; Chen
et al., 2013).
Figures 1C–E are serial transverse sections of the eye region
shown in Figure 1B. Here the ommatidial heterogeneity is
clear from characteristic pigmentation around the rhabdom
(Figures 1C–E). Distally, the non-fluorescing (type I) and
strongly fluorescing (type II) ommatidia contain red pigment in
R3 and R4, while the weakly fluorescing (type III) ommatidia
have pale red pigment there and have yellow pigment in R1 and
R2. The distribution of yellow pigment is restricted to the distal-
most region extending about 120 µm from the proximal tip of
the crystalline cone (Figure 1C). The yellow pigment emits green
fluorescence under blue-violet excitation (Figure 1C’). Around
200 µm proximal to Figure 1C, red pigment appears in R5–8 of
type I and II ommatidia as four clusters, arranged in trapezoidal
and square configurations, respectively (Figure 1D). As they
continue proximally, the pigment clusters become smaller, and
the pigment in type II ommatidia disappears almost completely
(Figure 1E).

a rectangle is enlarged in the inset), which fluoresces under blue-violet excitation (C’), in addition to reddish perirhabdomal pigment in R3–4. (D–E) The same

bar 20 µm in (C–E), 1 µm in (F–H).
The ommatidial heterogeneity is also apparent in the rhabdom
structure, especially in its distal tier. Electron microscopy reveals
that the cross section of the rhabdom of type I ommatidia is
trapezoidal because the rhabdomere of R1 is smaller than that of
R2. The microvilli of R1 are straight and parallel to the dorso-
ventral axis (defined as vertical), but those of R2 are curved,
suggesting that the cell has reduced polarization sensitivity. Here
the cell body of R2 (asterisk in Figure 1C) is larger than that of
R1 (see Figure 1C, solid circle), but more proximally, the cell
body as well as the rhabdomere of R1 becomes larger, and the
arrangement of the pigment clusters in R5–8 becomes trapezoidal
with the dorsal side longer (Figure 1D, solid circle). R1 and R2
appear in the opposite (mirror-symmetric) arrangement in other
ommatidia (Figure 1D, arrowheads). The rhabdom of type II
is rectangular in shape (Figure 1G) whereas, that of type III is
square (Figure 1H).
We counted the number of each type of ommatidium in 45
fluorescent pictures of the ventral eye region of 39 individuals,
and also in 21 transverse sections of 19 individuals. The ratio
of type I, II, and III is 42.3% (4614 among 10,914 ommatidia in
total), 9.7% (1060), and 48.0% (5240) (Table 1).

B clade as GsUV (G. sarpedon UV) and GsB, respectively. One
of three L opsins clusters with Papilio L2, and two others cluster
with Papilio L3: we therefore, refer to them as GsL2, GsL3a, and
GsL3b.

tribe Parnassiinae (L. japonica, L. puziloi, S. montela), and tribe
Troidini (A. alcinous, P. aristolochiae, T. aeacus). L opsins of
Papilionidae form three clusters, L1, L2, and L3 (Figure 2C). L1
opsins are found only in the genus Papilio, while L2 and L3 are
found in other tribes as well. We found that L3 opsins are further
duplicated in the genera Graphium and Luehdorfia.
Opsin mRNAs in Photoreceptors
We localized the opsin mRNAs in the retina of G. sarpedon by in
situ hybridization (Figure 3).
The micrographs in Figures 3A–E show serial dorso-ventral
sections of one eye labeled with different probes. The labeling
indicates that GsUV and GsB mRNA are expressed across the
entire retina but only in the distal tier (Figures 3A,B). The
labeling with the probes for L opsin mRNAs exhibits clear dorso-
ventral regionalization (Figures 3C–E).
The distribution pattern of GsUV and GsB mRNA in
transverse sections confirms the existence of three ommatidial
types. Figures 3F,G are consecutive sections in the distal tier
of the dorsal eye region, labeled with the GsUV and GsB
probes, respectively. These opsin mRNAs are expressed in two
distal photoreceptors, R1 and R2, in three combinations: one
GsUV-positive and another GsB-positive (type I, solid circle),
both positive for GsUV (type II, dashed circle), or both GsB-
positive (type III, dotted circle). We do not observe coexpression
of these mRNAs. The same pattern is seen in the ventral region
(Figures 3N, O).
The
L
opsin
mRNAs
exist
in
the
other
two
distal
photoreceptors,
R3
and
R4,
and
in
the
four
proximal
photoreceptors, R5–8. The labeling of R9 basal photoreceptors
could not be reliably established because of their small size.
The expression pattern of L opsin mRNAs is rather simple
in the dorsal region (Figures 3H–M), following the “one
photoreceptor–one opsin” principle. The GsL2 probe labels
R3 and R4 in all ommatidia (Figure 3H) and R5–8 in type
III ommatidia (Figure 3K). The GsL3a probe labels R5–8 of
type I and II ommatidia in the dorsal region (Figure 3L). The
faintly labeled structures in Figure 3I are the distal extensions of
R5–8 photoreceptors (see Figure 1F). Type I and II ommatidia
express three L opsins in the identical pattern, so they cannot
be discriminated in the in situ hybridization preparations
(Figure 3H–M).
The labeling pattern is complex in the ventral region, as
most R3–8 photoreceptors coexpress two opsin mRNAs. For
example, R3 and R4 of ventral type I ommatidia express GsL3a
weakly (Figure 3Q) and GsL3b strongly (Figure 3R). R5–8 of
type I express GsL3a strongly (Figure 3T) and GsL3b weakly
(Figure 3U). Table 1 summarizes the results.
Spectral Sensitivity of Photoreceptors
We measured the spectral sensitivities of 355 photoreceptors in
the eye of G. sarpedon and successfully localized 110 of these in
the retina.

Figure 4 shows three examples of labeled photoreceptors.
Figure 4A is a broad blue (bB) receptor peaking at 460 nm
(row i, see also Figure 5). The polarization sensitivity (row ii),
peaking at 0◦, indicates the cell has microvilli aligned parallel to
the dorso-ventral axis (Figure 1). Rows iii and iv show in vivo
fluorescence pictures of the eye under green and UV excitations,
respectively. The red-fluorescing ommatidium (row iii) contains
the Alexa fluor-injected bB receptor and this ommatidium is
in the dorsal region where no fluorescence is detected under
UV (row iv). Rows v and vi show sections containing the
labeled photoreceptor under green excitation (row v) and normal
transmission illumination (row vi). The set of pictures allows
us to unambiguously conclude that the recorded bB receptor
is R1 of a dorsal type I ommatidium. Similarly the broad
red (bR) receptor in Figure 4B is R5 of a strongly-fluorescing
type II ommatidium in the ventral region. The narrow green
(nG) receptor (Figure 4C) is R4 of a weakly-fluorescing type
III ommatidium in the ventral region. Polarization sensitivities
(row ii) reflect the orientation of microvilli and therefore,
provide another line of evidence to identify photoreceptors

provide similar examples for all other receptor classes in the
Supplementary Figures.
Figure 5 shows the spectral sensitivities grouped according to
the localization results. We categorize the photoreceptors into six
classes; ultraviolet (UV), violet (V), blue (B), blue–green (BG),
green (G), and red (R). The B class can be further divided into
three subclasses: broad blue (bB), narrow blue (nB) and dual-
peaked blue (dB) receptors. The G class contains four subclasses:
single-peaked green (sG), dual-peaked green (dG), narrow green
(nG), and broad green (bG) receptors. The R class contains five
subclasses: orange (O), shouldered red (sR), narrow red (nR),
broad red (bR), and deep red (dR) receptors. To our surprise,
we have identified 15 distinct spectral sensitivities in total, which
is the largest number among insects studied so far. The bB, dG,
sG, and sR receptors are found exclusively in the dorsal region,
whereas UV, BG and dB are found both in the dorsal and ventral
regions. The other eight sensitivities, V, nB, bG, nG, O, bR, nR,
and dR, are found only in the ventral region.
Visual Pigment Absorption Spectra and
Photoreceptor Spectral Sensitivities
By correlating the photoreceptor spectral sensitivities with the in
situ hybridization results, we can predict the absorption spectra
of the visual pigments. Type I ommatidia of the dorsal region
are particularly useful in this regard, because of the simple
pattern of opsin expression and the absence of UV-induced
fluorescence. We can infer the absorbance spectra of GsUV,

GsB, GsL2, and GsL3a from the spectral sensitivities of the UV,
bB, dG, and sR receptors, respectively, because these receptors
exclusively express their respective opsins. Unfortunately, there
are no photoreceptors that exclusively express GsL3b. However,
the O receptor is the most appropriate choice to estimate this
opsin’s absorbance, as it only weakly co-expresses GsL3a, and is
located in the distal tier where the self-screening effect is minimal
(Table 1).
Smooth colored lines in Figure 5 are the predicted absorption
spectra of the visual pigments determined by least-squares fitting
to a template (Stavenga et al., 1993). We thus, conclude that
GsUV is a visual pigment absorbing maximally at 354 nm (R354).

Similarly, GsB, GsL2, GsL3b, and GsL3a are R455, R541, R582,
and R599, respectively. A pioneering microspectrophotometry
suggested that nine species of butterflies, including P. rapae,
have visual pigments absorbing maximally at around 610 nm
(Bernard, 1979). However, this may have to be revisited because
recent studies have revealed that the long wavelength-absorbing
visual pigment of P. rapae is R563 (Wakakuwa et al., 2004). To
our knowledge, 599 nm is the longest absorption peak wavelength
among insect visual pigments so far identified.
DISCUSSION
Butterflies typically have a rich variety of spectral receptors in
their compound eyes (Briscoe, 2008). We found 15 distinct
photoreceptor types in the eye of G. sarpedon, which is a record
among all insects studied so far. Stomatopod crustaceans, which
have up to 16 spectral classes of receptors in their eyes (Cronin,
2006), have been considered to be exceptional, but our finding of
an almost equal level of spectral richness in a butterfly challenges
this view.
Origin of Spectral Sensitivities
As shown in Figure 5, the spectral sensitivities of UV, bB, dG,
O, and sR receptors fit reasonably well to the visual pigment
absorption spectra of GsUV, GsB, GsL2, GsL3b, and GsL3a,
respectively. The other spectral sensitivities can be explained
by the modification of the aforementioned absorption spectra
by a number of optical effects known to occur in butterfly
photoreceptors. These include filtering by fluorescent pigments
(Arikawa et al., 1999a), perirhabdomeral pigments (Arikawa
et al., 1999b), lateral filtering between rhabdomeres of different
spectral receptors sharing a single rhabdom (Snyder et al., 1973),
and optical waveguide effects (Stavenga and Arikawa, 2011).
For example, the narrow-band V receptor peaking at 400 nm
in the strongly-fluorescing ventral type II ommatidia arises
from the combination of R354 (GsUV) and the UV-absorbing
fluorescent pigment (Arikawa et al., 1999a). Even in the weakly-
fluorescing ventral type III ommatidia the UV sensitivity of
all photoreceptors is reduced, indicating the influence of the
UV-fluorescent pigment. The dR receptors in type I ommatidia
peak at 640 nm despite mainly expressing R599 (GsL3a). This
narrowing and shifting of the sensitivity curve toward longer
wavelength can be attributed to the filtering effect of red
perirhabdomal pigments, which is particularly prominent in
pierid species (Stavenga and Arikawa, 2011). The dB receptors
in the yellow-pigmented type III ommatidia express R455 (GsB),
but exhibit a trough around 450 nm. The yellow pigment emits
fluorescence under blue-violet excitation (Figure 1C’), which
indicates that its absorption wavelength is around 450 nm. Thus,
the trough is probably caused by the absorption effect of this
pigment.
The photoreceptors co-expressing two visual pigments are
more difficult to account for. We extensively manipulated the
relative proportions of R541 (GsL2), R582 (GsL3b), and R599
(GsL3a) in our attempt to reproduce the spectral sensitivities of
the bG and bR receptors in ventral type II ommatidia, and also
tried incorporating various pigment filtering effects. However, we
were unable to obtain satisfactory fits to our data.

 Chen et al.
Spectral Receptors in the Eye of Graphium Butterfly
The BG receptors, which peak around 500 nm and have a
long tail extending toward the long wavelength region, also
cannot be explained by the identified visual pigments. However,
their spectral sensitivity can be reproduced if we assume
the existence of another visual pigment peaking at 480 nm,
R480. Interestingly, the spectral sensitivities of both bG and
bR receptors could also be well reproduced by incorporating
the putative R480 together with the other L opsins. The
existence of R480 is yet to be confirmed by molecular biology,
however.
The enigmatic BG photoreceptor class is extremely rare; we
only found a few clearly labeled examples, both of which were
R3/4 of type I ommatidia. This is puzzling, because R3/4 in type
I ommatidia are usually dG (dorsal) or O (ventral) receptors.
The existence of BG receptors raises the possibility that “type
I” ommatidia actually comprise two subtly distinct subtypes
that appear around the transitional area between the dorsal and
ventral regions (see Table 1).
Evolution of Opsins and Dorso-Ventral
Specialization
We identified opsins from ten papilionid species including G.
sarpedon (Figure 2). L opsins are highly diverse in the lineage
of Papilionidae. They are divided into three clades: L1, L2, and
L3. The branching pattern suggests that in the papilionid lineage
the ancestral L opsin duplicated, with one copy becoming the
present L2 and the other duplicating once again to become L1
and L3. L1 opsins are restricted to the tribe Papilionini, and at
least in P. xuthus and P. glaucus there are no photoreceptors
that exclusively express their L1 orthologs (Kitamoto et al., 1998;
Briscoe, 2008); rather, L1 is always coexpressed with L2. On
the other hand, L2 and L3 exist in all tribes. Graphium and
Luehdorfia species have undergone a further duplication of L3.
These multiple L opsins probably serve to enrich the spectral
sensitivities of long wavelength receptors in Papilionidae, because
L2 (and L1) opsins are supposedly of the protein part of green-
absorbing visual pigment, and L3 opsins are of red-absorbing
visual pigment (Arikawa et al., 1999b; Figure 5).
In situ hybridization of L1 opsin mRNAs reveals clear dorso-
ventral specialization (Table 1, Figure 3). The expression pattern
of opsin mRNAs in the dorsal region is simple, basically
following the “one receptor–one visual pigment” principle,
while the ventral region is more complex. A wider range of
spectral sensitivities—especially in the longer wavelengths—
is found in the ventral region due to the co-expression of
multiple visual pigments and various spectral filtering effects
(Figure 5). Increased spectral richness in the ventral region is a
common feature of not only butterflies (Stavenga et al., 2001)
but also dragonflies (Futahashi et al., 2015). This is probably
an adaptation for detecting colored objects against a green
foliage background. G. sarpedon fly rapidly in woodland, looking
downwards to locate mates, flowers to feed on, and puddles
to take salt (Beck et al., 1999). They are strongly attracted to
individuals of the same and/or closely related species that are
sitting on the ground, with the result that they often form large
flocks on wetland.
Color Vision and Number of Spectral
Receptors
Do G. sarpedon use all 15 spectral receptors for seeing colors, i.e.,
is their vision pentadecachromatic? This has to be checked by
behavioral experiments, but it is rather unlikely. We previously
measured the wavelength discrimination ability of foraging P.
xuthus and found that they can discriminate lights whose
wavelength difference is as small as 1–2 nm in three distinct
wavelength regions. Their eyes are furnished with at least six
classes of spectral receptors, and we predicted which receptors are
involved in wavelength discrimination using the receptor-noise
limited color opponency model (Vorobyev and Osorio, 1998).
We concluded that color vision in P. xuthus is tetrachromatic and
based on the UV, B, G, and R receptors (Koshitaka et al., 2008).
The excluded receptors, V and BB, are probably used for some
other visual functions, such as for detecting particular signals or
low intensity light.
Vertebrates and insects are phylogenetically far apart, but
their color vision systems have been considered to be somewhat
similar based on the “conventional” spectral opponency principle
(Backhaus et al., 1998). We humans use an RGB trichromatic
system to discriminate colors in the wavelength range from 400
to 700 nm (Barlow, 1982; Maloney, 1986; Cronin et al., 2014).
The visual system of P. xuthus has added an UV channel, for
expanding the visible light range into the ultraviolet region down
to 300 nm. The minimum discriminable wavelength difference is
about 1 nm both in humans and P. xuthus, which may be due to
the fact that both systems share the conventional principle.
On the other hand, mantis shrimps that have 12–16 distinct
spectral receptor classes have therefore, been assumed to
discriminate colors better than any other animals. But in fact,
their wavelength discrimination ability is surprisingly poor: they
can barely distinguish lights whose wavelengths differ by more
than 15 nm (Thoen et al., 2014). In mantis shrimps, nearly all
the spectral receptor classes are confined to a region of the eye
called the mid-band, containing only six rows of ommatidia.
Mantis shrimps see colors by scanning the environment with
these “one dimensional color scanners.” This scanning principle
is strikingly different from what we see in “conventional” color
vision systems such as those of humans and butterflies (Marshall
and Arikawa, 2014).
The arrangement of spectral receptors in G. sarpedon is similar
to that of P. xuthus: three types of spectrally heterogeneous
ommatidia are randomly distributed, at least locally, in the
hexagonal array. Therefore, the color vision system of G.
sarpedon is most likely a conventional one, meaning that four
spectral channels should be sufficient to perceive colors over the
range from 300 to 700 nm.
This raises an obvious question: if only four receptor classes
are needed for color vision, then why did the other 11 evolve?
The answer is unknown, but it may be the case that several of the
receptor classes are tuned to detect specific stimuli of particularly
high ecological importance. One hypothetical example is the
ability of detecting colors of quickly moving targets. Flying males
often chase other flying objects including conspecifics. A unique
feature of G. sarpedon eye is the spectral variability of R3 and
R4 photoreceptors in the distal tier (BG, bG, dG, nG, sG, and

O, see Table 1), which are all green sensitive and fastest in P.
xuthus (Kawasaki et al., 2015). The fast R3–4 G receptors of P.
xuthus contribute to the chromatic motion detection system with
the spectrally variable R5–8 proximal photoreceptors (Stewart
et al., 2015). The spectral variety of R3–4 receptors in G. sarpedon
would enhance the chromatic property of motion vision, which
may be crucial for discriminating fast-flying conspecifics by the
complex wing colors (Stavenga et al., 2010).
