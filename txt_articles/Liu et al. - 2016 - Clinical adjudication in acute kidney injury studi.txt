ABSTRACT
Background. The NEPROCHECK test (Astute Medical, San
Diego, CA, USA) combines urinary tissue inhibitorof metallopro-
teinases-2 (TIMP-2) and insulin-like growth factor binding pro-
tein 7 (IGFBP7) to identify patients at high risk for acute kidney
injury (AKI). In a US Food and Drug Administration registration
trial (NCT01573962), AKI was determined by a three-member
clinical adjudication committee. The objectives were to examine
agreement among adjudicators as well as between adjudicators
and consensus criteria for AKI and to determine the relationship
of biomarker concentrations and adjudicator agreement.
Methods. Subjects were classified as AKI 3/3, 2/3, 1/3 or 0/3 ac-
cording to the proportion of adjudicators classifying the case as
AKI. Subjects were classified as Kidney Disease: Improving
Global Outcomes (KDIGO) AKI(+) when stage 2 or 3 AKI cri-
teria were met.
Results. Concordance between adjudicators and between adju-
dicators and KDIGO criteria were lower for AKI than non-AKI
subjects [78.9 versus 97.3% (P < 0.001) and 91.5 versus 97.9%
(P = 0.01)]. Subjects who were AKI 3/3 or 2/3 but KDIGO AKI(−)
had higher median [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] compared with thosewho
were AKI-1/3 or 0/3 but KDIGO AKI(+) {2.78 [interquartile
range (IQR) 2.33–3.56] versus 0.52 [IQR 0.26–1.64]; P = 0.008}.
[TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] levels were highest in patients with AKI 3/3
and lowest in AKI 0/3, whereas AKI 2/3 and 1/3 exhibited inter-
mediate values.
Conclusions. In this analysis, urine [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] levels
correlated to clinically adjudicated AKI better than to KDIGO
criteria. Furthermore, in difficult cases where adjudicators over-
ruled KDIGO criteria, the biomarker test discriminated well.
This study highlights the importance of clinical adjudication
of AKI for biomarker studies and lends further support for
the value of urine [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7].

INTRODUCTION
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common among hospitalized pa-
tients and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality
[1, 2]. At present, there are no therapies specific for AKI, and
care of patients with AKI is mainly supportive [3]. Consequent-
ly, early identification of AKI is thought to be critical because it
allows for prompt implementation of best practices, including
reevaluation of drug dosing, nephrotoxin avoidance, close at-
tention to fluid balance and other potential therapeutic maneu-
vers. In some cases it has been suggested that interventions (e.g.
transfer to the intensive care unit or placement of a line for dia-
lysis) should be considered based on the presence or absence
of moderate–severe AKI [4]. Ultimately, if patients at high
risk of AKI can be reliably identified, this may allow for clinical
trials of novel therapies designed to reduce the severity or dur-
ation of AKI [5]. Along the same lines, if earlier detection of
renal injury or identification of those at risk was feasible, then
best practice interventions could be implemented sooner, and
potentially improve outcomes.
The NEPHROCHECK test (Astute Medical, San Diego, CA,
USA) was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Admin-
istration (FDA) as the first test to identify patients at high risk
of developing AKI [6, 7]. This test measures urinary tissue in-
hibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2) and insulin-like

 growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) [8]. Elevated urinary
[TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] predicts an increased risk of moderate–
severe AKI over the next 12 h; patients with values >0.3 (ng/
mL)2/1000 have a 7-fold increased risk of AKI [95% confidence
interval (CI) 4–22] compared to those with lower levels [6].
Standardized, validated criteria exist for AKI. The Kidney
Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical prac-
tice guideline on AKI endorsed the use of modified Risk, Injury,
and Failure; and Loss; and End-stage renal disease (RIFLE)
criteria proposed by the AKI Network (AKIN) with minor mod-
ifications to include pediatric RIFLE for children [4, 9, 10]. How-
ever, despite well-established consensus criteria, AKI remains a
clinical diagnosis [4]. Consequently, as part of the FDA registra-
tion process for the Nephrocheck test, a panel of nephrologists
with expertise in AKI were convened to adjudicate AKI, rather
than relying only on consensus criteria. To the best of our knowl-
edge, this is the first time that AKI has been formally adjudicated
in an FDA registration trial. The goal of the current study is to
describe the adjudication process, to examine the relationship
of [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] values to AKI as defined by clinical ad-
judication both when the determination was unanimous and
when it was not and to examine biomarker results when clinical
adjudication departed from consensus criteria.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and procedures
The methods and results of the Topaz trial have been reported
previously [6]. Briefly, this was a prospective observational studyof
420 critically ill adult patients enrolled within 24 h of admission to
an intensive care unit (ICU) at 23 participating sites in the USA
from May through December 2012. Paired serum and urine
samples for analysis of serum creatinine and urinary [TIMP-2]•
[IGFBP7] were obtained immediately upon enrollment and then
stored frozen until analysis. The primaryendpoint wasthe diagno-
sis of AKI within 12 h of enrollment adjudicated by a clinical ad-
judication committee. Urine samples were analyzed for TIMP-2
and IGFBP7 by technicians blinded to clinical data using a clinical
immunoassay (NEPHROCHECK Test and ASTUTE140 Meter,
Astute Medical) at three independent hospital laboratories. The
test instrument automatically multiplied the concentrations of
the two biomarkers together and divided this product by 1000
to report a single numerical test result with units of (ng/mL)2/
1000 (the units for all [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] tests and cutoff values
in this report). The median of the [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] test results
from the three laboratories was used for analysis.
Adjudication process
The procedures for adjudication were defined in advance of the
study. Specifically, the three adjudicators were all board-certified
nephrologists with clinical expertise in AKI who determined
as a group which variables would be provided to them for ad-
judication. Importantly, all adjudicators were unaware of the
[TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] values throughout the adjudication pro-
cess. After a round of practice adjudication, the adjudicators
met by teleconference to review the approach to the clinical
data review and revisions were made. Variables included all
serum creatinine values for up to 6 months prior to and 72 h
after enrollment, all hourly urine output data available for up
to 24 h prior to and 72 h after enrollment, daily fluid balance
use of diuretics and baseline demographic data including
weight, age and clinical setting. However, results of urine mi-
croscopy or ultrasonography were not available to adjudicators.
AKI was defined according to the KDIGO consensus criteria [4]
as a doubling of serum creatinine from baseline or urine output
<0.5 cm3/kg/h × 12 h (Stage 2 or 3 AKI). The adjudicators were
asked to determine whether AKI was present or absent (defined
as ‘AKI’ or ‘no AKI’, respectively) within the 12 h after enroll-
ment and sample collection based on these criteria.
Adjudicators were encouraged to use their expert judgment
for each case. For example, an adjudicator could diagnose AKI
in a patient who died prior to reaching KDIGO criteria or who
received large volume resuscitation such that creatinine was
judged to be less reliable. Conversely, an adjudicator might
judge that AKI was not present even though creatinine or
urine output criteria were met if extenuating circumstances
were present. For example, if urine output criteria were only
transiently met (for an hour) and then followed by a period
of brisk urine output after diuretics, an adjudicator might
judge that AKI was not present. Adjudicators indicated their
diagnosis (‘AKI’ or ‘no AKI’) independently without consult-
ation with each other and were blinded to biomarker results.
For the current analysis we classified subjects as AKI 3/3, 2/3,
1/3 or 0/3 according to the proportion of adjudicators diagnos-
ing each case as AKI. In other words, if all three adjudicators
diagnosed a subject as having AKI, the subject was classified
as AKI 3/3. If only one adjudicator diagnosed the subject as
having AKI while the other two indicated no AKI, we classified
this as AKI 1/3. Adjudicators were required to classify all cases
as AKI or no AKI. For the purposes of the Topaz trial, a two-
thirds majority was predefined for use as the final diagnosis, so
subjects who were either AKI 2/3 or 3/3 were considered to have
AKI. We also determined whether subjects were KDIGO AKI(+)
or (−) when either Stage 2 or 3 criteria were met or not, respect-
ively, by serum creatinine or urine output using a computer algo-
rithm without any adjudicator input.
Statistical analysis
The association between rater concordance and AKI status
was tested using the Fisher exact test. Fleiss’ kappa was used to
assess the reliability of agreement between the three clinical ad-
judicators. Levels of [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] were compared in
those subjects where there was discordance between the clinical
adjudication committee and the KDIGO criteria using the Wil-
coxon rank sum test. Subjects were then grouped based on the
presence or absence of AKI based on the clinical adjudication
committee review and on whether or not there was concordance
between all three reviewers, and levels of [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7]
were compared using the Kruskal–Wallis test and Jonckheere–
Terpstra trend test. To compare the correlations between
[TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] and clinically adjudicated or KDIGO
AKI, the difference in two paired Somer’s D rank correlations
was calculated using levels of [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] as the response
variable and clinicallyadjudicated and KDIGO AKI asthe two pre-
dictors. Finally, allP-values were two-sidedandaP-value<0.05was

Station, TX, USA) or R 3.1.0 (R Project for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria) were used for all analyses.
RESULTS
Of 408 subjects enrolled with clinical data available, 71 had AKI
(56 AKI 3/3 and 15 AKI 2/3) and 337 did not (9 AKI 1/3 and
328 AKI 0/3) based on the clinical adjudication committee re-
view. There was complete agreement between the three clinical
adjudicators (AKI 3/3 or 0/3) in 94.1% of cases. However, con-
cordance of all three reviewers was lower for AKI than for no
AKI (78.9 versus 97.3%; P < 0.001; Table 1). Interreviewer reli-
ability ranged from 0.84 to 0.95 (Table 2), indicating excellent
agreement. Overall, Fleiss’ kappa was 0.86 (95% CI 0.80–0.92;
P < 0.001) for all three adjudicators.
When KDIGO AKI criteria were applied, 72 patients were (+)
and 336 patients were (−). Agreement between the clinical adju-
dication committee and the KDIGO criteria was 96.8% overall.
Similar to the concordance between clinical reviewers, agreement
between the clinical adjudication committee and the KDIGO cri-
teria was lower for AKI than for no AKI (91.5 versus 97.9%; P =
0.01; Table 3); seven patients were KDIGO AKI(+) but did not
have AKI by clinical adjudication and six were KDIGO AKI
(−) but had AKI based on the majority opinion of the clinical
adjudicators (AKI 3/3 or 2/3). Furthermore, for these 13 patients
where there was not agreement between the clinical adjudication
committee and the KDIGO criteria, concordance of all three
clinical adjudicators was much lower than for those where
there was agreement (38.5 versus 95.9%; P < 0.001).
We next examined urine [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] in the 13 cases
where clinical adjudication differed from KDIGO. As shown in
Figure 1, the median [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] levels were lower in
KDIGO AKI(+) patients without AKI by clinical adjudication
[0.52 (IQR 0.26–1.64)] compared with KDIGO AKI(−) pa-
tients who had AKI according to the clinical adjudication com-
mittee [2.78 (IQR 2.33–3.56), P = 0.008]. Clinically adjudicated
AKI correlated more closely with [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] than did
KDIGO AKI (P = 0.007), as determined by Somer’s D rank
correlation.
Finally, [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] levels were compared between
the four groups: AKI 3/3, 2/3, 1/3 and 0/3. As shown in Figure 2,
the lowest [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] levels were observed in AKI 0/3
patients, while AKI 3/3 displayed the highest values [0.32 (IQR
0.16–0.83) versus 1.68 (0.80–2.87), P < 0.001]. Discordance
among adjudicators (AKI 1/3 and 2/3) was observed with inter-
mediate [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] values [0.52 (IQR 0.31–0.99) and
1.13 (0.47–2.27)]. Overall we observed increasing median
[TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] values from AKI 0/3 to 3/3 (P < 0.001 for
overall trend). Similarly, when we examined the proportion of in-
dividuals in each of the four groups who had levels above the two
cutpoints inclinical use (0.3 and 2.0), we observed an overall trend
toward a greater number of people above the cutpoint as AKI sta-
tus went from 0/3 to 3/3 (P < 0.001 for overall trend; Figure 3).
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge this is the first study to examine the relation-
ships between a biomarker and agreement between members of
a clinical adjudication committee and between the majority ad-
judicator opinion and KDIGO criteria for AKI. Our results are
notable first because they demonstrate the importance of clin-
ical adjudication in clinical studies of AKI. While our clinical
adjudicators generally agreed with KDIGO, nearly 10% of the
subjects judged to have AKI by the adjudicators were KDIGO
AKI(−) and in these KDIGO AKI(−)/adjudicator AKI(+)

For the purposes of this study, those with KDIGO Stage 1 AKI were not considered to have AKI. Agreement was present if the clinical adjudication committee adjudicated that AKI was not
present and the maximum KDIGO stage was 0 or 1 or if the clinical adjudication committee adjudicated that AKI was present and the maximum KDIGO stage was 2 or 3.

 cases, urinary [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] was always elevated, estab-
lishing a clear ‘biologic signal’. While our study only used data
from an observational study, the results suggest that AKI inter-
ventional trials should be adjudicated as well since a substantial
number of clinically relevant AKI cases may be missed with
solely KDIGO criteria. Second, these results provide further evi-
dence for the utility of urinary [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7]. Even in
cases where experts disagree with one another or with
KDIGO criteria, the biomarker test provides further informa-
tion. This is important because these are precisely the kinds
of cases where biomarkers are needed most—both for clinical
practice and for clinical studies [7]. For example, two clinicians
may differ on whether AKI is present or not, and in these cases,
biomarkers can provide incremental information to help solid-
ify the diagnosis.
Of note, [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] is not a diagnostic test for
AKI, but rather a ‘risk assessment’ test that identifies indivi-
duals at increased risk for AKI over the next 12 h. Higher levels
portend greater risk for AKI [6] and for adverse long-term out-
comes [11]. Consequently, we also sought to better understand
the relationship of [TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] and AKI, as identified
by a committee of experts. Our hypothesis was that when ex-
perts agree, biomarker discrimination will be maximized. Our
results bear this out.
We showed that agreement between the three members of
the clinical adjudication committee was excellent, but not
100%. Not surprisingly, agreement was greater for non-AKI
than for AKI. A review of study charts where there was dis-
cordance between reviewers (AKI 1/3 and 2/3) suggested
that in those cases, subjects often met AKI criteria for a very
short period of time early within the 12 h risk assessment win-
dow, just missed meeting urine output criteria for AKI because
of transient brisk urine output or were obese (>150 kg), so
urine output normalized to weight may have been variably in-
terpreted by adjudicators. It should be noted that the adjudi-
cator training required to achieve excellent consensus between
three expert nephrologists was relatively straightforward and
should be replicable in future clinical studies. Adjudicators
underwent training that was composed of two teleconferences,
with a round of practice cases that were reviewed and dis-
cussed on the second call. During the clinical trial, adjudica-
tors had the clinical trial protocol and the training slides
available as references.
Our review of the small number of KDIGO AKI(+), clinic-
ally adjudicated non-AKI (AKI 0/3 or 1/3) subjects revealed
that KDIGO AKI(+) non-AKI was identified when subjects
met AKI criteria for a very short period of time early within
the risk assessment window or when the serum creatinine
was falling but more than double the premorbid baseline. In
such cases, the clinical adjudication committee determined
that those patients did not have clinical AKI within the risk as-
sessment window, yet the patients technically met KDIGO
Stage 2–3 criteria.
Major strengths of our study include blinding of clinical
adjudicators to biomarker measurements as well as detailed
clinical data collected as part of the trial that allowed for
hour-by-hour assessment of AKI. Limitations include the fact
that we have not yet demonstrated that this approach can be ex-
tended beyond the three members of the clinical adjudication
committee. However, as previously stated, the approach was
predefined and training was standardized, so our approach
should be applicable to future studies as well.

 In sum, we examined agreement between three nephrologists
for diagnosis of AKI in the context of a trial of novel biomarkers
focused on risk assessment for AKI. We demonstrated that with
limited training that can be easily accomplished, agreement was
excellent, but not universal, and clinical adjudication did not
always agree with strict KDIGO criteria. Interestingly, biomarker
levels were higher in those with clinically adjudicated AKI rather
than those with AKI by consensus definition alone—in general
[TIMP-2]•[IGFBP7] results supported the majority opinion of
the experts. Our results highlight the importance of clinical
adjudication committees in studies of AKI.
