Objective: To investigate compositional cartilage changes measured with 3T MRI-based T2 values over 48
months in overweight and obese individuals with different degrees of weight loss (WL) and to study
whether WL slows knee cartilage degeneration and symptom worsening.
Design: We studied participants from the Osteoarthritis Initiative with risk factors or radiographic evi-
dence of mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis with a baseline BMI �25 kg/m2. We selected subjects who
over 48 months lost a, moderate (BMI change, 5e10%WL, n ¼ 180) or large amount of weight (�10%WL,
n ¼ 78) and frequency-matched these to individuals with stable weight (<3%, n ¼ 258). Right knee
cartilage T2 maps of all compartments and grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture analyses
were evaluated and associations with WL and clinical symptoms (WOMAC subscales for pain, stiffness
and disability) were assessed using multivariable regression models.
Results: The amount of weight change was significantly associated with change in cartilage T2 of the
medial tibia (b 0.9 ms, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.1, P ¼ 0.001). Increase of T2 in the medial tibia was significantly
associated with increase in WOMAC pain (b 0.5 ms, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.6, P ¼ 0.02) and disability (b 0.03 ms,
95% CI 0.003 to 0.05, P ¼ 0.03). GLCM contrast and variance over all compartments showed significantly
less progression in the >10%WL group compared to the stable weight group (both comparisons,
P ¼ 0.04).
Conclusions: WL over 48 months is associated with slowed knee cartilage degeneration and improved
knee symptoms.

Introduction
Obesity is a highly prevalent condition and is a major risk factor
for knee OA1,2. Biomechanical factors such as increased joint loads
and systemic metabolic factors have a negative impact on cartilage
degradation3e5. Co-occurrence of these factors with obesity accel-
erates the cartilage degeneration process and worsens clinical
symptoms6,7. Cartilage degeneration is associated with altered
content of proteoglycans and water and degradation of the fibrillar
collagen network8. Ideally, these findings should be diagnosed at
early stages, before irreversible hyaline cartilage damage occurs.
MRI-based T2 relaxation time has been identified as an imaging
biomarker that provides information on early changes in collagen
integrity9. Moreover, previous studies have shown that T2 mea-
surements are able to predict changes in cartilage morphology and
radiographic OA10e12.
Studies demonstrated improvement of clinical performance
through weight loss (WL)13,14. A previous study has shown that T2
relaxation times progress less in subjects with >10% WL of their
baseline BMI over 4 years indicating decreased degenerative
changes in comparison to controls without WL15. However, asso-
ciations between T2 values in patients loosing weight over time and
clinical parameters are not well understood. Another previous

individuals is dependent on the amount of weight loss: 48-month data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative, Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2016),

 study found that percentage weight change was significantly
associated with change in medial tibial cartilage volume16, yet this
study was limited to investigating cartilage volume only, without
compositional imaging, which provides information on early
changes in cartilage, even before cartilage volume loss may have
taken place9.
Previous studies have shown that quantitative analysis of
cartilage texture using grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)
texture parameters contrast, entropy and variance, allows early
detection of compositional and structural changes within the
cartilage matrix in subjects with risk for osteoarthritis, before
radiographic evidence for OA is present, by providing information
on the distribution of T2 pixel values17,18. Imaging of homogeneity
may visualize early laminar disruption within cartilage, as does
laminar analysis, which analyzes the bone and surface layer of
cartilage separately19.
Therefore, in this longitudinal study over 48 months in over-
weight and obese subjects we analyzed the association of different
degrees of WL with changes in symptoms and change in cartilage
T2, laminar and GLCM texture analysis parameters as measures of
progression of knee cartilage degeneration.
Method
Subjects
The Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI; http://www.oai.ucsf.edu) is an
ongoing, longitudinal, prospective, multi-center cohort study with
4796 participants of which subjects for this study were selected.
The initiative is sponsored by the U.S. National Institutes of Health
(NIH) for investigation of diagnosis, treatment and prevention of
OA. Subjects between 45 and 79 years of age with (progression
cohort) or are at risk for (incidence cohort) symptomatic knee OA
were included into this study. Knee imaging and clinical data were
been obtained annually. Informed consent was obtained from all
subjects and the study was HIPAA compliant. Study protocols,
amendments
and
informed
consent
documentations
were
approved by the local institutional review boards. The following
OAI datasets were used: baseline imaging dataset 0.E.1, 48 month
follow-up imaging dataset 6.E.1, clinical datasets at baseline 0.2.2,
12 month follow-up 1.2.1, 24 month follow-up 3.2.1 and 48 month
follow-up 6.2.2.
For our study, subjects with BMI for baseline, 12, 24, 36 and 48-
month follow up were selected from the OAI database (progression
and incidence cohort). Subsequently, subjects with missing BMI
data at any of the four time points, a baseline KellgreneLawrence
(KL) score > 3 in the right knee, or rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed
during follow-up were excluded from these subjects. Of those,
patients with an initial BMI of less than 25 kg/m2 and a WL of 3e5%
were excluded.
Since the trajectory of WL may affect longitudinal changes in
joint structures and clinical symptoms, a linear regression model
was implemented to assess the annual rate of change in BMI over 4
years. Weight change of the subjects was categorized into “steady”
weight and “uneven” weight change, based on the root mean
square error (RMSE) of the individual's regression line. In this study,
we excluded subjects (n ¼ 84) with uneven WL from the overall
cohort, which was defined as an RMSE for weight change above the
95th percentile of the RMSE. Reason for this selection criteria was
to select patients that follow the linear and steady WL trajectory in
order to avoid a bias through subjects that “cycle” through weight
gain and WL periods over 48 months and therefore to isolate the
effects of continuous steady WL on knee cartilage as good as
possible. Also subjects with development of cardiac failure, cancer
and/or other severe diseases over the course of the 48-month study
period, which could have been responsible for the WL, were
excluded using the Katz comorbidity questionnaire20. From these
subjects only those with right knee MRI T2 mapping sequences
available at baseline and 48 months were selected. All subjects that
were left after the previous mentioned exclusion criteria (n ¼ 1981)
were categorized into groups based on their WL over 48 months:
moderate (BMI decrease of 5e10%), large amount (BMI decrease of
>10%) of WL and stable weight (BMI changes <3%). We randomly
selected subjects from among those in the 5e10% weight loss group
(5e10%WLG; n ¼ 180) and the >10% weight loss group (>10%WLG;
n ¼ 78) and frequency matched these on sex (m/f), age (10 year
strata from 45 to 65 and one 14 year stratum from 65 to 79),
baseline BMI (BMI in 2.5 kg/m2 strata) and KL (KL in strata of 0/1
and 2/3). Subjects with stable weight (n ¼ 258) were randomly
selected from each stratum in the frequency matching process and
matched to the respective WL subjects. This study design was
chosen in order to minimize the impact of these covariates (age,
sex, baseline BMI and KL) since their impact on the rate of T2
progression is known from previous studies21e25.
The subject selection process is illustrated in Fig. 1 and subject
characteristics are shown in Table I.
An a priori power analysis was performed to calculate the
appropriate size of each subgroup in order to analyze differences
between the groups. Using preliminary data of our previous study
in controls (n ¼ 65) and subjects with >10%WL (n ¼ 62) over 48
months, the average change of T2 in the medial femur was
1.89 ± 1.98 ms in the control group and 0.67 ± 2.05 ms in the >10%
WLG. With these data a comparison between two different WLGs
was simulated and we determined a sample size of at least 70
subjects per group would achieve a power >0.9. Therefore we
included 78 subjects in the >10%WLG and 180 subjects in the
5e10%WLG in order to ensure adequate group sizes for the
comparison.
MR imaging
MR images were acquired using four identical 3.0T scanners
(Siemens Magnetom Trio; Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany)
and quadrature transmit-receive coils (USA Instruments, Aurora,
OH, USA) at four sites (University of Maryland, School of Medicine,
Baltimore, MD; University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA; Memorial
Hospital of Rhode Island, Pawtucket, RI and The Ohio State Uni-
versity, Columbus, OH). T2 values were obtained using sagittal two-
dimensional multislice, multiecho sequences with seven echo
times (TEs 10 ms, 20 ms, 30 ms, 40 ms, 50 ms, 60 ms, and 70 ms).
Further details are available in the OAI MR protocol26.
Image analysis
Semi-automatic cartilage segmentation of lateral femur, lateral
tibia, medial femur, medial tibia and patella compartments was
performed as previously described, using an in-house, spline-based
software based on MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, Massachusetts).
This algorithm also calculated the mean cartilage thickness of all
ROIs for each compartment as previously described12. Cartilage was
segmented and graded by two trained researchers (M.S. and G.F.),
applying this semi-automatic cartilage segmentation tool using the
first echo of the MSME sequence and manually correcting the po-
sition of control points if needed, in consensus, and under super-
vision of an experienced radiologist (T.M.L.).
Only artifact-free slices with well-defined boundaries of carti-
lage were segmented. The trochlea was not segmented because of
interfering flow artifacts from the popliteal artery. For each
compartment, T2 maps were created and T2 relaxation times were
estimated by a mono-exponential decay model as a fitting function

 for the signal intensity at the echo times 20e70 ms. The first echo
(10 ms) was not used in order to improve signal-to-noise ratio27.
Laminar analysis was automatically performed, subdividing the
segmented compartments into a superficial and deeper cartilage
layer of equal thickness17. Superficial layers were orientated to the
articular surfaces, deeper layers adjacent to the cartilageebone
interface. The analysis of these cartilage layers separately may
provide a more sensitive assessment of T2 measurements and
better characterizes cartilage degenerative changes, as previously
shown. For correct interpretation of longitudinal data of laminar
analysis, cartilage thickness may not show significant cartilage
thickness changes over time19. Therefore cartilage thickness of each
region was calculated based on distance between the cartila-
geebone interface and the closest point on the articular surface.
The average thickness of each slice was calculated, and averages
were summed to determine over all cartilage thickness28.
Since previous studies have shown that T2 is limited in assessing
more advanced degenerative disease21, we performed an additional
sub-analysis in which we excluded all KL ¼ 3 patients and re-
analyzed the data (n ¼ 478; number of subjects with KL ¼ 3

stable weight group (SWG), n ¼ 19 (7.4%); 5e10%WLG, n ¼ 11 (6.1%);
>10%WLG, n ¼ 8 (10.2%); Table I). This step was undertaken to
confirm the results were not caused by a bias in the analysis created
by subjects with more severe cartilage defects, since T2 values tend
to be less useful in these subjects21.
In addition to standard T2, we also performed an exploratory
analysis of cartilage texture using GLCM texture analysis to evaluate
the
spatial
distribution
of
T2
values,
as
described
previ-
ously17,18,29,30. We included two GLCM parameters from the contrast
group (contrast and homogeneity), one parameter each from the
orderliness group (entropy) and the statistics group (variance), as
published previously17,18. GLCM contrast expresses the differences
of values of neighboring pixels, consequently high GLCM contrast
indicates a high probability of neighboring pixels with large differ-
ences in T231. GLCM homogeneity decreases exponentially inversely
from the contrast value and expresses the similarity of neighboring
pixels, indicating that higher GLCM values reflect high similarity
between neighboring pixels17,29. GLCM variance is a measure of the
dispersion of pixel values around the mean T2, meaning that high
GLCM variance reflects a high number of pixels with T2 co-
occurrences dispersed from the mean T218,32. GLCM entropy is a
measure of orderliness regarding the distribution of pixel value co-
occurrences, therefore high GLCM entropy indicates that pixel pairs
with same T2 values are less likely to be found17,18,29,30.
WOMAC questionnaires
Knee pain and function were assessed with Western Ontario and
McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)33. WOMAC
subscales for pain, stiffness and disability (5 point scale) at baseline
and 48 months, as described previously34, were investigated in this
analysis.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with Stata/IC Version 13.1
software (StataCorp, College Station, TX) using a two-sided 0.05
level of significance.
One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA; for parametric testing)
and chi-square tests (for categorical variables) were used to eval-
uate differences in subject characteristics between subjects with
stable weight, 5e10% WL and >10% WL.
All models werecheckedforthe following assumptions that were
met (values are provided for the dependent variable baseline over all
T2): linearity between the predictor variables and the dependent
variables (Lack of Fit F ¼ 1.42, P ¼ 0.33), normality of the dependent
variables and the residuals (ShapiroeWilk test P > 0.05), homoge-
neity of variances (Levene's test statistic ¼ 1.61, P ¼ 0.20), absence of
influential outliers in the data (max observed: Cook's distance is
0.042 and leverage is 0.049), and absence of multicollinearity (none
of predictor variable pairs have correlation above 0.2).
In order to fulfill the assumption of independence, a random
data sample was selected. Additionally, the DurbineWatson sta-
tistic (1.98) indicated that the assumption of independence of the
errors was satisfied.
The associations between changes in T2 relaxation times and
the assignment to different weight loss groups (SW, 5e10%WL,
>10%WL) over 48 months were assessed using multivariable
regression models adjusting for age, sex, baseline BMI and baseline
KL score (independent variables: groups; dependent variable: DT2
parameters). The entire T2 analyses were repeated after excluding
subjects with KL ¼ 3, using the same statistical approach. Due to the
large number of parameters, the analyses were split into the
following categories (based on previously published data15e18):
primary data (compartments: over all, medial tibia, patella; imag-
ing parameter: mean T2, bone layer texture parameters contrast
and variance); exploratory data (compartments: lateral femur,
lateral tibia, medial femur; imaging parameters: articular layer,
texture parameters entropy, homogeneity).
Differences in changes of GLCM texture parameters over 48
months between the SWG and the two weight loss groups were
calculated (independent variables: groups; dependent variable:
DGLCM texture parameters).
Cartilage thickness at baseline and cartilage thickness changes
over 48 months and the association with the amount of WL was
analyzed by using linear regression models, adjusting for age, sex,
baseline BMI and baseline KL score (independent variables: groups;
dependent variable: baseline cartilage thickness and Dcartilage
thickness, respectively).
Associations of changes in WOMAC subscales (pain, stiffness and
disability) or changes in cartilage T2 with weight change over 48
months were assessed using multivariable regression models
adjusting for age, sex, baseline BMI and baseline KL score (inde-
pendent variables: percentage of change in BMI; dependent vari-
able: D WOMAC subscales or DT2 parameters).
Reproducibility
Both for the intra- and inter-reader reproducibility, T2 mea-
surements were calculated on a percentage basis as the root mean
square average of single coefficients of variation (CV) to assess the
reproducibility error, as previously described35.
Inter-reader reproducibility was assessed between the two
readers (M.S. and G.F.) in 10 patients and was 1.66% over all com-
partments. CVs for single compartments were as follows: 1.28% for
the lateral femur, 1.11% for the lateral tibia, 1.29% for the medial
femur, 2.01% for the medial tibia, and 2.42% for the patella.
For intra-reader reproducibility analysis, the same reader per-
formed repeated T2 measurements in 10 randomly selected pa-
tients with readings separated by at least 14 days. Intra-reader CVs
were calculated for each compartment using these repeated mea-
surements and compartment specific and over all CVs were as
follows: 0.92% for the lateral femur, 1.14% for the lateral tibia, 1.07%
for the medial femur, 1.63% for the medial tibia, 2.33% for the pa-
tella, and 1.42% over all compartments.
Results
Subject characteristics
Characteristics of all subjects are described in Table I. There were
no significant differences in mean age, baseline BMI or gender fre-
quencies between the groups. Distribution of KL score, baseline
WOMAC subscales, imaging site and race did not differ significantly
between any of the groups (P > 0.05, respectively). After 48 months,
subjects in the >10%WLG lost 4.22 ± 1.97 kg/m2 on average while the
5e10%WLG had lost 2.03 ± 1.29 kg/m2 on average. BMI change of the
SWG was 0.08 ± 0.97 kg/m2. The association between change in BMI
and change in WOMAC subscales pain, stiffness and disability is
shown in Table IV. The more weight was lost, the more WOMAC
subscales improved (P < 0.05, respectively).
Change of T2 relaxation time and WL
T2 changes for different groups and compartments are shown in
Table II. Increase of global T2 between baseline and 48 month
follow-up (DT2) was significantly smaller in the medial tibia in the
>10%WLG compared to the SWG (P < 0.001), as demonstrated in
Fig. 2, suggesting less progression of cartilage degeneration over

 time for the >10%WLG in the medial tibia. Yet, there was no sig-
nificant change of T2 in the 5e10%WLG compared to the SWG
(P > 0.05). The relationships between percentage of body WL and
the change of T2 over 48 months are presented in Table IV (Fig. 3).
After adjusting for age, sex, baseline BMI and KL, weight change was
significantly associated with change in T2 of the medial tibia (b
0.9 ms, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.1, P ¼ 0.001), but not in the medial femur (b
0.2 ms, 95% CI �0.1 to 0.2, P ¼ 0.8) or patella (b 0.09 ms, 95%
CI �0.07 to 0.3, P ¼ 0.3). These results demonstrate that for every 1%
of WL there was 0.9 ms less increase of cartilage T2 over 48 months,
suggestion less progression of cartilage degeneration the more
weight was lost.
In laminar subanalyses, changes of global T2 over 48 months
were significantly lower in the >10%WLG compared to the SWG,
showing globally slowed cartilage degeneration after >10%WL in
the bone layer (P ¼ 0.03). Moreover, changes of T2 over 48 months
of the bone layer of the patella showed significantly lower values in
the >10%WLG (P ¼ 0.04) compared to the SWG, suggesting less
progression of cartilage degeneration in the patella in the >10%
WLG over 48 months.
After excluding subjects with KL ¼ 3 and re-analyzing the
dataset, mean T2 of all compartments combined was significantly
lower in the >10%WLG compared the SWG (P ¼ 0.02) and signifi-
cance levels of the differences between these two groups in the
other compartments improved (Supplemental data).
Changes in GLCM, cartilage thickness and WL
In the >10%WLG, changes in GLCM contrast and variance over all
compartments (P ¼ 0.04 and P ¼ 0.04, respectively) as well as in the
patella (P ¼ 0.01 and P ¼ 0.04, respectively) over 48 months were
significantly lower than in the SWG, suggesting less progression of
cartilage inhomogeneity and increased orderliness in the >10%WLG.
Decrease of GLCM homogeneity over 48 months was signifi-
cantly lower in the medial tibia in the >10%WLG compared to the
SWG (P ¼ 0.004; Table III). We re-analyzed the data with Bonferroni
correction, to verify that our significant findings were not caused by
the number of hypotheses tested, yet this did not change the
results.
Over all compartments, there were no significant differences in
baseline cartilage thickness and in cartilage thickness changes over
48 months between the SWG and both WLGs (P > 0.05) assessed.
Associations of changes in clinical symptoms and cartilage T2
Increase of T2 in the medial tibia was significantly associated
with an increase in the WOMAC subscales for pain (b 0.5 ms, 95% CI
0.2 to 0.6, P ¼ 0.02; Table V and disability (b 0.03 ms, 95% CI 0.003 to
0.05, P ¼ 0.03). These results demonstrate 0.5 ms increase in
cartilage T2 in the medial tibia per point increased on the WOMAC
subscore pain scale.
Over all compartments, increase in T2 was significantly associ-
ated with increase in the WOMAC subscale for stiffness (b 0.1 ms,
95% CI 0.003 to 0.2, P ¼ 0.04). Similarly to the findings in the medial
tibia, WOMAC subscale for disability showed a statistical trend (b
0.02 ms, 95% CI �0.002 to 0.4, P ¼ 0.07), again, suggesting pro-
gression of cartilage degeneration over all compartments being
associated with clinical worsening.
Discussion
In this study, the effect of WL on the biochemical composition,
texture and thickness of cartilage in individuals with risk factors for
OA was analyzed using MR-based T2 relaxation time measure-
ments. We found significantly less increase of cartilage T2 in
overweight and obese subjects in the medial tibia over 48 months.

 Less clinical worsening was associated with both, lower T2 increase
over time and a substantial amount of WL. Moreover, especially in
the >10%WLG, slower cartilage matrix degeneration through WL
over all compartments was found with texture analysis. The highest
association of WL and reduced cartilage degeneration was found in
the medial tibia, which adds to the hypothesis that WL is most
protective in the medial weight-bearing compartments16,36.
These findings are supported by the GCLM homogeneity
parameter measured, which suggests less progression of cartilage
degeneration after a large amount of WL, especially within the
medial tibia36. Also, a previous study has demonstrated that per-
centage of weight change was significantly associated with change
in cartilage volume of the medial tibia, yet although our range of
weight change was smaller our over all study cohort was larger16.
This study is the first to examine the longitudinal association
between WL over 48 months, and change in both, cartilage T2 and
symptoms. The association found between changes in cartilage T2
in the medial tibia with change in clinical symptoms pain and
disability emphasizes WL being an important primary manage-
ment strategy in obese individuals in order to avoid or slow pro-
gression of OA.
Previous studies suggested a link between obesity and pro-
gression of OA37,38 and demonstrated that weight gain was strongly
associated with increased31 and >10%WL was associated with
slower progression of cartilage degeneration15. Neither of the

 mentioned studies have investigated a group with 5e10%WL, nor
have they evaluated cartilage texture analysis, laminar analysis or
clinical data15. To our knowledge, this is the first study to quantify
cartilage composition with texture and laminar analysis in obese
subjects after stratifying these in two groups with different
amounts of WL.
Nevertheless, similar to the previous study, the >10%WLG had
significantly less increase of T2 in the medial tibia. With laminar
analysis, less increase of T2 was found in the bone layer over all
compartments combined in the >10%WLG compared to the SWG17,
which emphasizes the superiority of laminar analysis in detecting
changes in cartilage composition and differences over all com-
partments in between the groups, compared to using solely mean
T2 values as used in previous studies15. These results derived from
laminar analysis suggest a slowed progression of cartilage degen-
eration in subjects with >10%WL effects all compartments.
Further previous studies have shown that T2 values are limited
in assessing more advanced degenerative disease21 and interest-
ingly, after excluding subjects with radiographically moderate OA
(KL ¼ 3), T2 relaxation times in both cartilage layers significantly
decreased in the >10%WLG compared to the controls. These find-
ings underline the global protective effect of WL for the entire joint
cartilage matrix, which confirms and broadens previous findings15.
Additionally, in the >10%WLG, slower cartilage degeneration
through WL over all compartments was found with texture anal-
ysis, which supports the importance of more sophisticated analysis
to increase accuracy in the investigation of cartilage composition.
Moreover, the assessed GLCM parameters of contrast, variance
and entropy reflect heterogeneity of the cartilage extracellular
matrix12,18,30. Previous studies have shown that elevated GLCM
parameters suggest cartilage degeneration18. Interestingly, signifi-
cantly less increase of GLCM contrast and variance was found over
all compartments as well as at the patella in the >10%WLG
compared to controls, suggesting decelerated degenerative changes
of cartilage in all compartments18. This may be caused by texture
parameters showing earlier and stronger signal changes through
WL in all compartments. Previous studies confirmed that texture
and laminar analysis add valuable information to solely assessed
mean T2 values, detecting smaller changes, which may be other-
wise masked by over all spatial T2 changes in the collagenous extra-
cellular matrix18. This underlines the importance of our findings of
texture analysis over all compartments, since in the previous
studies no differences in the global T2 changes over all compart-
ments were detected between the >10%WL and the SWG. This
study demonstrates that subjects without WL showed more
elevated and heterogeneous cartilage T2 compared to subjects that
lost a substantial amount of weight over all compartments.
Therefore texture analysis was able to detect differences in
biomechanical cartilage composition over all compartments while
simultaneously cartilage T2 alone was not able to detect differences
in changes of cartilage quality.
Our study has limitations, which need to be reported: no addi-
tional image analysis was performed assessing morphological
changes of MRI findings. Nonetheless, further investigations in
which structural MR findings are associated with WL in obese and
overweight subjects, are warranted. Moreover, we performed a
retrospective analysis of subjects' WL data. Therefore many con-
founders can only be controlled in a prospective study, such as
activity levels, diet, and comorbidities. These confounders might
cause issues regarding the analysis, especially at a 5e10%WL cohort.
Also, the analysis of effects of weight gain on cartilage degeneration
is of great clinical importance and needs to be investigated in future
studies.
In summary, our study demonstrated that weight change was
significantly associated with change in cartilage composition in the
medial tibia and in WOMAC subscales for pain and disability in
obese and overweight individuals. Yet, after creating subgroups,
only the >10%WLG was associated with significantly decreased

 progression of compositional cartilage degeneration compared to
stable weight in individuals with risk factors or mild to moderate
radiographic evidence for OA. Based on our findings we hypothe-
size that WL has a protective effect on cartilage, which is detected
in all compartments, and that a larger amount of WL is more
beneficial in obese and overweight subjects in order to slow pro-
gression of cartilage matrix deterioration and worsening of clinical
symptoms.
