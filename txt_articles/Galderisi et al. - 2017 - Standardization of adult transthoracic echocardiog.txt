Methods
and results
Demographic data (age, body surface area, blood pressure, and heart rhythm and rate), type (vendor and model)
of ultrasound system used and image quality need to be reported. In addition, measurements should be normalized
for body size. Reference normal values, derived by ASE/EACVI recommendations, shall always be reported to dif-
ferentiate normal from pathological conditions. This Expert Consensus document suggests avoiding the surveillance
of specific variable using different ultrasound techniques (e.g. in echo labs with high expertise in left ventricular
ejection fraction by 3D and not by 2D echocardiography). The report should be also tailored in relation with dif-
ferent cardiac pathologies, quality of images, and needs of the caregivers.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
The conclusion should be concise reflecting the status of left ventricular structure and function, the presence of
left atrial and/or aortic dilation, right ventricular dysfunction, and pulmonary hypertension, leading to an objective
communication with the patient health caregiver. Variation over time should be considered carefully, taking always
into account the consistency of the parameters used for comparison.

Introduction
The quantification of cardiac chamber size and function is the main-
stay of echocardiographic imaging. In the recent years, echocardio-
graphic technology has evolved with two major developments:
real-time 3D echocardiography (3DE) and speckle tracking-derived
myocardial deformation imaging. Nowadays, the integration of these
two modalities with the standard echocardiographic Doppler tools
(M-mode, 2D, colour, pulsed- and continuous-wave Doppler, and tis-
sue Doppler imaging) substantially enriches and extends the capabil-
ities of a comprehensive examination oriented to provide the
broadest information on cardiac structure and function. At the begin-
ning of 2015, ASE and EACVI have jointly prepared a document on
the quantification of cardiac chambers, which defines the acquisition
and recording methodologies of different echocardiographic modal-
ities and establishes reference values to differentiate normal from
pathological conditions.1 This information can be appropriately com-
bined with remarks provided by the more recent 2016 American
Society
of
Echocardiography
(ASE)/European
Association
of
Cardiovascular Imaging (EACVI) recommendations on the evaluation
of left ventricular (LV) diastolic function2 and of valvular heart disease
(VHD).3
Cardiac ultrasound operators are called to substantially update the
characteristics of the echocardiographic report to highlight the im-
portance of the new echocardiographic measurements, integrate
new and traditional measurements, and formulate a comprehensive
and systematic, but clinically, relevant report. This approach should
be tailored in relation with different cardiac pathologies and to the
needs of the patients and caregivers (cardiologists and non-cardiolo-
gists) that receive the report. Particular care needs to be taken to in-
tegrate quantitative information of chamber and haemodynamic
parameters with structural (e.g. valve tickening, calcification, and pro-
lapse) and functional (flow measurements) measurements of cardiac
valves.3
The present expert consensus document of the EACVI has been
designed to propose a modern echocardiographic report in line with
the expectations of physicians and sonographers who operate in the
fields of cardiac ultrasound.
Left ventricle
Quantification of the LV encompasses structural measurements (LV
size and mass) and functional parameters (LV global and regional sys-
tolic function and LV diastolic function).2 Currently, LV size is easily
obtained by measuring LV internal cavity diameters at end-diastole
and end-systole by M-mode or, better, by a direct 2D approach.
Information on LV structure and geometry can be finalized adding
quantitative values of LV mass and relative wall thickness—derived
from measurement of both internal LV cavity diameter and wall thick-
nesses at end diastole—which identifies LV hypertrophy and remod-
elling (concentric or eccentric), respectively.1 These measurements
are joined with determination of 2D-derived LV volumes [end-dia-
stolic (EDV) and end-systolic (ESV)] indexed for body surface area
(BSA) and LV ejection fraction (EF), a recognized hallmark for out-
comes in clinical cardiology. In laboratories with proven experience,
it is ‘nice to have’ echo determination of 3D-derived LV volumes and
EF,4 which do not rely on geometric assumptions, and leads to better
accuracy and reproducibility in patients with good imaging quality.
Information of LV regional systolic function is necessary to be pro-
vided by visual assessment of 17 (or 18 or 16) segments wall motion
score index (WMSI). LVEF and WMSI have a close inverse relation,
characteristic that also allows to achieve an internal quality check in-
side a given echo lab. It is important to present LV segmentation
scheme in the echo report since it reflects coronary perfusion terri-
tories and permits a standardized communication with other cardiac
imaging techniques. A model with 17 segments (with the apical cap at
the top of the other 4 apical segment: septal, inferior, lateral, and an-
terior) should be preferred.
Whenever possible, speckle tracking-derived global longitudinal
strain (GLS) shall be obtained and reported to provide quantitative
analysis of LV longitudinal function. GLS is accurate in early detection
of subclinical alterations in LV longitudinal function, which occurs be-
fore LVEF impairment.5,6 GLS has demonstrated to be highly feasible
and reproducible in the clinical setting7 and provides an incremental
predictive value in unselected patients undergoing echocardiography
for determination of LV function at rest.8 Because of vendor (type
and model) variability of speckle-tracking analysis, there is not a clear

cut-off value of GLS, but a range from -18% to- 22% can be reason-
able in a healthy person. Stroke volume and cardiac index are neces-
sary, particularly in the assessment of VHD.9
According to the 2016 ASE/EACVI recommendations,2 quantita-
tive information on LV diastolic function includes at least transmi-
tral E/A ratio and E velocity deceleration time (DT), e0 velocity
(average and absolute value of septal and lateral side) of the mitral
annulus by pulsed tissue Doppler, E/e0 ratio, and the estimate of
systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) derived from tricuspid
regurgitation (TR) velocity. Values of the four recommended vari-
ables for the identification of LV diastolic dysfunction—annular e0
velocity, average E/e0 ratio, LA volume index (LAVi), and peak TR
velocity—should always be reported. Despite its controversial ac-
curacy for LV filling pressure (LVFP) degree estimation,10 E/e0 ratio
has a recognized value in predicting not only main cardiac events
but also mortality.11,12 The use of the difference between pulmon-
ary flow-derived atrial reverse (Ar) and transmitral atrial (A) veloc-
ities duration could be considered and reported when one of more
than the mentioned parameters cannot be determined or LVFP de-
gree remain undetermined.
Left atrium
It is important to evaluate left atrial (LA) size systematically. Because
LA is an asymmetrical cavity, LA size is more accurately reflected by
2D-derived LA volume rather than area or linear dimension.1,13–15 In
the absence of conditions such as mitral valve disease, atrial fibrilla-
tion, athlete’s heart and heart transplantation, LA volume represents
the chronic burden of LVFP over time2 and is strongly associated
with prognosis in cardiac patients.16,17 LA volume should always be
indexed for BSA (LAVi).1,2 3D echocardiography, potentially more
accurate in volume measurement,18 is poorly applied in the clinical
practice because of the lack of standardized methodology and limited
normative data. Although several studies demonstrated the incre-
mental prognostic value of LA strain in diseases such as atrial fibrilla-
tion and mitral valve disease,19,20 the lack of a dedicated software and
standardized methodology prevent its inclusion in a routine echocar-
diographic report.1–4
Aorta
Although transthoracic echocardiography does not allow a full exam-
ination of the aorta, it helps in detecting alteration of specific seg-
ments, considering that proximal aorta is the most common area of
dilation.21 Diameters of annulus, aortic root (maximal diameter at
sinus of Valsalva), sinotubular junction, and proximal ascending aorta
are necessary to obtain a comprehensive evaluation of thoracic aortic
size. Aortic annulus shall be measured by inner edge-to-inner edge
diameter in mid-systole, while all other measurement shall be taken
using leading edge-to-leading edge convention at end diastole.1 All
these diameters should be measured by 2D rather than M-mode
echocardiography and normalized for body surface area.1,21 Imaging
and measurements of aortic arch through the suprasternal view is
strongly recommended when plaque, thrombus, or dissection are
suspected.22
Right ventricle
A quantitative right ventricular (RV) assessment shall include RV basal
and mid-cavity linear dimension as well as proximal and distal RV out-
flow tract at end diastole. Although recent findings suggest that
indexing RV size to BSA may be relevant in some conditions,23–25
measurements of these studies lacked reference cut-off points and
frequently reported areas more than RV linear dimensions.
Consequently, indexation of RV measurement is not advocated in
the echo report.
Conventional assessment of RV systolic function shall comprehend
at least one of the following: fractional area change (FAC), tricuspid
annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), systolic (s0) velocity of lat-
eral tricuspid annulus by pulsed tissue Doppler and myocardial per-
formance index (MPI), calculated either with pulsed Doppler of RV
or with pulsed tissue Doppler of lateral tricuspid annulus. RV longitu-
dinal strain has shown good feasibility and reproducibility26 and its
angle independence makes this parameter suitable for routine clinical
use. Of note, RV longitudinal strain, particularly of the free wall, has
shown a prognostic value in various diseases.27–30 In laboratories
with proper experience, 3D RV volumes (eventually normalized for
BSA) and RV ejection fraction (EF), extensively validated against car-
diac magnetic resonance imaging,31,32 can be promoted in patients
with good acoustic windows, especially when standard indices of lon-
gitudinal RV function are globally reduced and no longer representa-
tive of overall RV performance.
Right atrium and pulmonary
arterial pressure
The preferred method to report about right atrial (RA) size is
2D-derived RA volume (from the apical four-chamber view) indexed
for BSA.1 Similarly to LA size, RA volume is more accurate than RA
linear measurements. If available, 3D RA quantification is prefer-
able.33,34 Reporting on indexed RA volumes requires two main preci-
sions: first, 2D vs. 3D acquisition because of different normal range
values (RA is usually underestimated with 2D compared with 3D)
and second, gender, since normal range is lower in women than in
men.35 Further parameters such as sPAP and RA pressure estimation
on the basis of inferior vena cava (IVC) size and collapse shall be
taken into account.36 According to 2015 ASE/EACVI recommenda-
tions, specific values of RA pressure rather than ranges shall be used
in sPAP determination. IVC diameter and respiratory variation drive
RA pressure degree determination according to recent guidelines on
pulmonary hypertension.37
Valve apparatus
When reporting echo features in VHD it is very important to provide
information on the type and degree of valve dysfunction as well as on
the hemodynamic burden induced by the valve defect to optimize
diagnosis, stratify prognosis, and address management.
Description of left and right valve apparatus shall consider the type
of valve defect. In regurgitant valve disease, 2D transthoracic echo
allows to quickly differentiate severe regurgitation from minor leak.3
The description of valve morphology is necessary to point out aeti-
ology (primary/organic or secondary/functional) and mechanism of
Echo report according to chamber quantification, diastole, and heart valve disease recommendations

regurgitation (normal or abnormal valve motion). Valve motion
abnormalities are currently described using Carpentier’s classification
of leaflets motion: Type I, normal leaflets motion; Type II, excessive
motion; and Type III, restrictive motion.38 In addition, colour Doppler
is critical to assess the regurgitation degree. Semi-quantitative [vena
contracta (VC)] and quantitative [proximal isovelocity surface area
(PISA)] are recommended in more than trivial regurgitation.39 It is also
particularly important to describe the presence and the location of
calcifications and the thickness of the valves.
Transthoracic echocardiography appears to be very useful also in
valve stenosis. Transvalvular peak velocities and maximum and mean
pressure gradients are needed to estimate the stenosis degrees.
Whenever possible, the evaluation of valve area by continuity equa-
tion is needed since loading condition influence transvalvular velocity
and pressure gradient. Additional information on stroke volume/
stroke volume index and LV filling pressure are necessary.40
In both regurgitant and stenotic valve diseases, the haemodynamic
effects on ventricles and atria, as well as the estimation of sPAP, shall to
be always analysed and reported (see section dedicated to VHD). In
the presence of VHD, 3D echocardiography provides additional infor-
mation on valve apparatus and its relation with other cardiac structures
(especially for mitral valve disease). However, 3D echocardiography is
strongly limited by lower spatial resolution compared with 2D images
and to the level of expertise of individual operators.41
How to focus echo report in
different diseases
In patients with heart failure
The 2016 ESC guidelines on heart failure (HF) consider other cardiac
imaging tests only when ‘echo images are suboptimal or an unusual
cause of heart failure is suspected’.42 In HF patients, for the best diag-
nosis establishment and treatment strategy decision, measurements of
LV structure, systolic, and diastolic function as well as estimated RV
function and sPAP degree are mandatory1,2 in the echo report. In the
2016 ESC guidelines, HF with preserved EF is defined as an
LVEF>
_ 50% and patients with an LVEF between 40% and 49% are
considered in a grey zone, which is defined as HF with mid-range EF.42
Accordingly, this terminology shall be applied in the echo report.
Important functional alterations, suggested by ESC guidelines, such as
E/e0 ratio >
_ 14 and average e0 velocity< 9cm/s42 shall also be high-
lighted. Other strongly encouraged parameters include LVGLS, 3D
LV volumes and EF, RV free-wall longitudinal strain—despite contro-
versial43—and RV fractional area change. Among these parameters,
particular emphasis shall be reserved for LV GLS and 3D LVEF. LV
GLS can be in fact altered as a sign of LV longitudinal dysfunction, par-
ticularly in HF with preserved LVEF, a condition in which an early diag-
nosis can have important reflections in the patient’s management.44
LV GLS has demonstrated the ability for a subclinical detection of LV
dysfunction in several clinical conditions including anticancer drug-
related cardiotoxicity44 and has a recognized prognostic value in HF
with both reduced and preserved LVEF.45–48 A cut-off value upon
-18% (although magnitudes are vendor dependent)1 can be expected
to indicate normal LV longitudinal systolic function. The use of 3D
echo-derived LV volumes and EF becomes particularly crucial in
candidates for implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)/cardiac
resynchronization therapy (CRT) because of its intrinsic better repro-
ducibility when compared with 2D EF.49 The 35% cut-off point of
LVEF can be considered more accurate using 3D than 2D echocardi-
ography and drive appropriate choices in this clinical setting.
The description of the mechanical dyssynchrony (septal flash, ap-
ical rocking assessed qualitatively, and or quantitatively using longitu-
dinal strain data) can be utilized in candidates to CRT but remain still
controversial to be included in the echo report. Optional measure-
ments include LV sphericity index (long axis/short axis), LV and RV
pre-ejection time (determined by pulsed Doppler), duration of LV
filling (mitral inflow duration), and 3D-derived RVEF.
In patients with coronary artery disease
Reporting information on LV global and regional systolic function is
mandatory in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Two or
3D LV EDV and ESV shall be calculated and LVEF derived. When
available, LV GLS shall be considered in the echo report of all CAD
patients, in particular in acute coronary syndromes. LV GLS is early
impaired in the presence of acute and chronic myocardial ischemia5
and provides a significant incremental value for identifying patients
with LV subclinical dysfunction over pre-test likelihood of CAD.50 It
also predicts recovery of LV systolic function after acute myocardial
infarction51 and has a recognized incremental prognostic value over
LVEF in chronic CAD52 and acute myocardial infarction.53
Regional LV systolic function needs to be assessed in the model with
17 segments reflecting coronary perfusion territories. Semi-quantitative
evaluation of regional motion (1= normokinesis, 2= hypokinesis,
3= akinesis, and 4= dyskinesis) shall be used to calculate WMSI.
Other parameters of prognostic relevance include measurements
of LV diastolic function—mainly transmitral E/A ratio, E velocity DT,
e0 velocity, E/e0 ratio, and LAVi according to 2016 recommenda-
tions2—and indexes of RV systolic function (TAPSE or s0 velocity of
lateral tricuspid annulus). An E velocity DT< 130 ms and an E/e0
ratio > 15 should be reported as remarkable adverse prognosticators
after acute myocardial infarction.11
LV mechanical dispersion based on 2D speckle tracking, calculated
as the standard deviation of the time to peak longitudinal strain of 16
LV segments, has been demonstrated to predict arrhythmic events
independently of LVEF after acute myocardial infarction.54
In patients with valvular heart disease
In VHD descriptive morphological findings of the valves3—which al-
ways need to be well delineated in the echo report—and traditional
calculated measurements have to be integrated into a concise and
conclusive echo report. Because VHD mainly affects geometry and
function of cardiac cavities, the neighbouring cavities shall be accur-
ately assessed with respect to size and function, e.g. LV and LA for mi-
tral valve diseases, LV and aortic root, and proximal ascending aorta
for aortic valve diseases.
In general, haemodynamic alterations in chronic VHD should be
reported to characterize different stages and alterations of myocar-
dial function that are related to disease. In left VHD, the quantitative
assessment of LV diameters, volumes, and EF as well E/e0 ratio and
sPAP is mandatory. LV GLS, often preceding LVEF reduction, is nice
to have for detecting subclinical alteration and predicting postopera-
tive recovery of LV function.55,56

To characterize LV remodelling in chronic mitral and aortic valve
diseases measures as sphericity index (calculated as LV short-to-long-
axis dimension ratio at end diastole in apical four-chamber view), with
a cut-off value of 0.76,57 could be given. LV total and effective stroke
volume should be determined by LV volumes and, additionally, by
measuring LV ouflow tract (LVOT) cross-sectional area and pulsed
Doppler-derived velocity time integral (VTILVOT V) to check the cor-
rectness of LV volume measurements and to estimate regurgitant vol-
umes in the presence of valve regurgitation. In aortic stenosis, 3D
echocardiography may provide an accurate assessment of LVOT area
thus avoiding underestimation due to geometric circular assump-
tion.40 Measurement of tricuspid annular diameter in mid-systole is
mandatory in left-sided heart diseases with surgical indication (cut-off
point for tricuspid annuloplasty= 40mm). LA size and function shall
be evaluated in all patients with mitral valve diseases by 2D or 3D as-
sessment. In patients with aortic valve disease, dimensions of LVOT,
aortic annulus, aortic root, sinotubular junction, and proximal ascend-
ing aorta shall be reported, better if indexed for BSA.3 In patients with
tricuspid and pulmonary valvular diseases, echocardiographic evalu-
ation shall focus on sizes and function of the right heart chambers.
Especially for the evaluation of tricuspid valvular diseases, 3D echocar-
diographic quantification of RV volumes and EF is nice to have.1
In patients with cardiomyopathies
2D left and right ventricular dimensions shall always be measured in
patients with cardiomyopathies, not only for their diagnostic value but
also for their well-known prognostic impact.58,59 It is necessary to in-
clude 2D measurements of wall thickness (e.g. in patients with asym-
metric hypertrophy additional information on septal morphology and
wall hypertrophy localization are required) and cavity diameters, 2D
or 3D measurements of volume and LVEF. Description of myocardial
aspect (sparkling of myocardial wall, hyper-trabeculation) are needed
to differentiate various kind of cardiomyopathies. Three-dimensional
echocardiography should be preferred for quantifying LV mass in ab-
normally shaped ventricles or in patients with asymmetric hypertro-
phy.59 Linear and volumetric measurements shall be indexed for BSA
to avoid misdiagnosis. Additionally, 3D assessment of LVOT is recom-
mended in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, when septal re-
duction therapy is indicated.59
The assessment of LV GLS should be considered in patients with
cardiomyopathies because of its incremental value over conventional
methods.59 In some cardiomyopathies, the distribution of regional
longitudinal strain can represent an argument in favour of an aetiolo-
gical diagnosis (e.g. apical sparing in cardiac amyloidosis).60,61 In par-
ticular, RV strain of the free wall (three segments) is nice to have in
arrhythmogenic ventricular cardiomyopathy, where a decrease has
been shown in early disease stages.62
In patients with systemic diseases and
suspected cardiac involvement
Numerous systemic diseases such as arterial systemic hypertension,
diabetes mellitus, obesity, haemochromatosis, sarcoidosis, systemic
sclerosis, storage disorders (e.g. Fabry, Pompe) endomyocardial fibro-
sis, and others can affect the heart. Since signs of cardiac involvement
by systemic disorders can be subtle, a comprehensive report of quan-
titative parameters is required. The report shall include 2D
measurements of wall thickness, volume, and cavity diameters, with
calculation of LV mass for diagnosis of LV hypertrophy, LV and RV sys-
tolic parameters as well as measurements of LV diastolic function.
Echocardiographic measurements to be considered in hypertensive
patients are comprehensively delineated in ASE/EACVI recommenda-
tions on the use of echocardiography in adult hypertension.63 LV mass
index is always necessary, as it is a recognized prognostic factor in ar-
terial systemic hypertension.64 Values of LV mass shall always be
indexed for BSA, but studies suggest that indexing to height powered
to 2.7 or 1.7 has the advantages to better identify the rate of LV hyper-
trophy and prognosis in overweight/obese patients.65,66 Calculation of
relative wall thickness allows categorization of LV mass increase as ei-
ther concentric (relative wall thickness>0.42) or eccentric (<
_0.42)
hypertrophy as well as the identification of concentric remodeling
(normal LV mass þ increased relative wall thickness).1
Quantitative information on LV diastolic function shall be con-
sidered in systemic heart disease. Abnormally increased E/e0 ratio is
suggestive of primary cardiac events in uncomplicated hypertensive
patients.12 Although LV EF is normal in the vast majority of systemic
heart diseases, LV GLS could provide a useful evaluation of early, sub-
clinical changes of systolic function in this setting, particularly in
hypertensive and diabetic patients.67,68
Main points of the echo report
Primarily, referral diagnosis or reason of the echo examination and
demographic data such as age, body height, and weight are mandatory
on the echo report. In particular, Doppler parameters of diastolic and
systolic function—including pulsed tissue Doppler—69,70 but also LV
GLS71,72 —are all strongly age dependent, and their values shall there-
fore be considered carefully in relation with the age of a given patient.
Key points
• In patients with suspected or ascertained HF, the echo exami-
nation needs to be very comprehensive, including quantitative
information on LVEF, longitudinal function (preferably GLS),
LV diastolic function and LVFP as well as pulmonary pressure
degree and RV function.
• In patients with CAD, assessment of LV global and regional
systolic function shall be routinely reported. Global and re-
gional longitudinal function can provide additional information
in this clinical setting. Diastolic parameters also have a recog-
nized value. In VHD, valve morphological findings shall be well
integrated with highlights on geometry and function of the car-
diac cavity that reflects the haemodynamic burden of the
valvular disease.
• In patients with cardiomyopathies, the report shall include 2D
measurements of wall thickness and cavity diameters, 2D or
3D measurements of volumes and LVEF as well as GLS and
diastolic parameters.
• In patients with systemic heart disease, the report shall include
2D measurements of wall thickness and cavity diameters, 2D
or 3D measurements of LV volume and EF with calculation of
LV mass for diagnosis of LV hypertrophy.

The reporting of type of echo machine used (vendor and model) is
necessary. The inter-vendor and software variability of advanced echo
parameters currently used—mainly LV GLS—73 is well recognized and
even a similar variability of some standard echo parameters (mainly
those obtainable by pulsed Tissue Doppler) cannot be excluded a priori.
It is important to report the quality of cardiac imaging recorded,
possibly grading as optimal, fair, suboptimal, and poor. A judgement of
the examination quality is important as the lack of some parameters
can lead to inconclusive diagnosis when the quality of the images is
suboptimal/poor. Under these circumstances, the use of advanced
echo techniques such as strain and 3D may become misleading.
Some important measurements (e.g. LV internal cavity diameters,
LV mass, and LA volume) need to be normalized for BSA (which can
be obtained by height and weight). In addition, blood pressure and
both heart rhythm and rate at the time of the echocardiographic
examination are also mandatory. In patients who undergo dialysis sta-
tus of ‘post- or pre-dialysis’ should also be mentioned. LV and RV
functional parameters are strongly influenced by changes in afterload
and even LV GLS is subjected to variations of both systolic and dia-
stolic BP.67,68 It is also well recognized how all Doppler measure-
ments of diastolic function are extremely variable in relation to
changes in heart rate.74 In patients with sinus tachycardia, a transmi-
tral E/A ratio cannot be ascribed to LV abnormal relaxation pattern
and is in fact associated with a very short E velocity deceleration time
(conversely prolonged
in the case of abnormal relaxation).
Obviously, also the type of rhythm (sinus, atrial fibrillation, and repeti-
tive premature beats) can influence systolic and diastolic measure-
ments. Accordingly, reporting heart rhythm and rate may produce
substantial changes in the interpretation of the echo results.
The 2015 chamber quantification recommendations present the
reference normal and abnormal values of all the described param-
eters.1 Therefore, cut-off points of the echo parameters address a
clinical diagnosis on the state of cardiac structure and function. Table
1 is summarizing the reference values of the main chamber param-
eters and LV diastolic measurements. The main echo parameters ob-
tainable with advanced echo techniques and their reference values
are described in Table 2. The mention of clear cut-off points of nor-
malcies is a key point to guide the report conclusions and permits to
orientate the readers for an appropriate diagnosis. The grading of the
severity of abnormality with terms such as mild, moderate, and
severe—available in the recommendations—can be applied in the
conclusions of the report.Another key point is to avoid the repetition
of the same echocardiographic parameter obtained with different
techniques (e.g. LVEF or LAVi with 2D and 3D echocardiography) in
the report. The operator has the opportunity to choose the most ac-
curate and reproducible technique in individual patients considering
the given disease and the technology availability. For instance, LV GLS
is the best parameter for quantifying LV longitudinal function but, if
speckle tracking is not available, acceptable information on LV longi-
tudinal function can be provided by pulsed tissue Doppler-derived s0
velocity of the mitral annulus or even by the simple M-mode-derived
MAPSE (average of septal and lateral sides). 3D echocardiography is
preferable for quantification of LVEF in patients with present crucial
range values (between 30% and 40%) to drive the best management.
Figure 1 summarizes an EACVI proposal for an echo report, which
needs, however, always to be tailored to individual patients, patho-
logical conditions, and quality of the images. Whenever speckle-
tracking technology is not available, LV GLS and RV fee-wall LS can
be replaced by pulsed tissue Doppler-derived s0 velocity of mitral and
tricuspid annulus, respectively.

. Conclusions of the echo report
The conclusions of the report shall be concise, but also conclusive,
whenever possible, for the diagnosis of the main pathology in a given
patient. The conclusions shall answer to the clinical question and be
clinically driven and oriented towards the disease management and
treatment.
The
abnormal
findings
shall
be
highlighted
first.
Information on the state of LV structure and function (systolic and
diastolic) and LVFP estimate, more than the simple categorization of
LV diastolic patterns, shall be reported. Information on the presence
of LA and/or aortic dilation, RV systolic dysfunction, and pulmonary
arterial hypertension is always needed. The advent of novel ultra-
sound techniques introduces detailed quantitative measurements
Key points
• Demographic data, type (vendor and model) of machine, and
quality of imaging always need to be reported.
• The adjustment of some important measurements for body
size is needed.
• The report shall include normal reference values to differenti-
ate normal from pathological conditions.
• It is suggested to avoid the report of the same parameter using
different ultrasound techniques.

malities. (A) Anagraphic and biometric data, (B) vendor and images quality, (C) bull’eye of regional wall motion, (D) quantitative analysis, (E) valve de-

that are helpful for more thorough assessment and comparisons.
These detailed quantifications should lead to clear inferences and
clear final impressions to reassure the objective communication be-
tween operator and recipient of the echo report, who is responsible
for clinical management. The authors of this consensus promote the
grading of more traditional parameters in the final report with the
use of standardized semi-quantitative terms, such as mildly or moder-
ately abnormal, to determine the degree of the aberration from nor-
mality. Consequently, the standardization of cut-off values for any
non-numerical description of abnormality for all measurements is
considered imperative. Variation over time, compared with a previ-
ously performed echo examination, shall be considered carefully, tak-
ing always into account the consistency (diagnostic accuracy,
feasibility, and reproducibility) of the parameters used for a given
comparison. Very reproducible measurements (e.g. E/e0 ratio, LV
GLS, 3D-derived LVEF) can be used appropriately to identify im-
provement or worsening of clinical conditions, whereas changes of
other indexes (e.g. LV mass calculated by either 2D or M-mode and
2D-derived LVEF) need to be interpreted with much more caution.
The principal information provided to non-cardiologist recipients
regarding the cardiac anatomy and function shall (i) answer the ques-
tion posed by the referring physician, (ii) emphasize abnormal find-
ings, and (iii) compare essential data of a previous echocardiographic
exam, if any.
Conflict of interest: None declared.
