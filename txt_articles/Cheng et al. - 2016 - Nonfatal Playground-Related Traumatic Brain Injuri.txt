abstract
OBJECTIVE: To describe the circumstances, characteristics, and trends of emergency 
department (ED) visits for nonfatal, playground-related traumatic brain injury (TBI) among 
persons aged ≤14 years.
METHODS: The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System–All Injury Program from 
January 1, 2001, through December 31, 2013, was examined. US Census bridged-race 
population estimates were used as the denominator to compute rates per 100 000 
population. SAS and Joinpoint linear weighted regression analyses were used to analyze 
the best-fitting join-point and the annual modeled rate change. These models were used to 
indicate the magnitude and direction of rate trends for each segment or period.
RESULTS: During the study period, an annual average of 21 101 persons aged ≤14 years were 
treated in EDs for playground-related TBI. The ED visit rate for boys was 39.7 per 100 000 
and 53.5 for persons aged 5–9 years. Overall, 95.6% were treated and released, 33.5% 
occurred at places of recreation or sports, and 32.5% occurred at school. Monkey bars or 
playground gyms (28.3%) and swings (28.1%) were the most frequently associated with 
TBI, but equipment involvement varied by age group. The annual rate of TBI ED visits 
increased significantly from 2005 to 2013 (P < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: Playgrounds remain an important location of injury risk to children. Strategies 
to reduce the incidence and severity of playground-related TBIs are needed. These may 
include improved adult supervision, methods to reduce child risk behavior, regular 
equipment maintenance, and improvements in playground surfaces and environments.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Modern 
playground surfaces reduce the risk of death or 
serious injury due to falls. However, playgrounds 
are still important locations of injuries to children; 
these injuries may be further reduced through the 
application of injury prevention strategies.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: A national sample of 
emergency department visits for playground-related 
traumatic brain injuries among persons aged ≤14 
years was studied, fi
 nding 21 101 persons affected 
with this condition from 2001 to 2013. This describes 
the importance of continued efforts to improve 
playground safety.

Playgrounds have social and physical 
benefits for children, but these 
settings also pose the threat of 
injury.1 Before the modernization 
of playgrounds, falls from extreme 
heights and impact with nonresilient 
(or hard) surfaces, such as grass and 
asphalt, were commonly associated 
with skull and upper extremity 
fractures.2–4 Such falls sometimes 
caused severe injuries to the head 
and neck and contributed to death. 
In response to these unfortunate 
occurrences, industry standards have 
been changed to improve the safety 
of children on playgrounds.5
Playground surfacing standard 
ASTM F1292 was established by 
the American Society for Testing 
and Materials (ASTM) in 1999 to 
reduce the risk of serious injury and 
death from falls.5 The US Consumer 
Product Safety Commission (CPSC) 
offers similar guidance, but such 
specifications do not prevent all 
injuries.6 In the United States from 
1996 to 2005, ∼213 700 playground 
injuries occurred annually 
among persons aged ≤18 years.7 
Furthermore, from 2001 to 2009, 
there were an estimated 16 706 
emergency department (ED) visits 
annually for playground-related 
traumatic brain injury (TBI) among 
persons aged ≤19 years.8 Most of 
these patients were treated and 
released, suggesting that they would 
likely be best categorized as mild in 
severity.
TBIs, even those categorized as mild, 
can have serious implications for the 
physical, cognitive, and behavioral 
health of children, including physical 
impairments, lowered cognitive 
skills, and deficits in behavioral 
and adaptive functioning.9–11 
These problems can lead to further 
consequences, such as disability, 
academic failure, and social isolation. 
Studies suggest that even children 
with mild TBI are at risk for 
disability because of psychosocial 
effects that require specialized 
resources to return to community 
living.12 Therefore, understanding 
the epidemiology and trend of 
playground-related TBI is necessary 
to guide strategies to reduce the 
occurrence of this injury.
To date, no national study has solely 
described the epidemiology and 
trend of playground-related TBI 
since the establishment of ASTM 
F1292 in 1999. Because most 
playground-related TBI ED visits 
occur among persons aged ≤14 
years, 
8 our objectives in this study 
were to describe the characteristics 
and trends among persons aged 
≤14 years who visit a US ED for 
playground-related TBI.
METHODS
To characterize nonfatal TBIs 
sustained during playground 
activities, we used data from 
the National Electronic Injury 
Surveillance System–All Injury 
Program (NEISS-AIP) from January 
1, 2001, through December 31, 
2013. Jointly operated by the CPSC 
and Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) since 2001, 
NEISS-AIP contains data on initial 
visits for all injuries treated in US 
EDs, regardless of whether they are 
associated with a consumer product. 
NEISS-AIP data are drawn from a 
nationally representative subsample 
of 66 of 99 NEISS hospitals that have 
a minimum of 6 beds and a 24-hour 
ED.13 The sample reflects a stratified 
probability sample of hospitals in 
the United States and its territories. 
NEISS coordinators, designated by 
each participating hospital, record 
a free-text narrative description 
and abstract NEISS-specified 
variables, such as primary body part 
injured, principal diagnosis, patient 
disposition, cause, intent, and date of 
treatment.13, 
14 All NEISS-AIP data are 
restricted to the principal diagnosis 
and primary body part injured 
for each visit. For example, TBIs 
documented as a secondary diagnosis 
or considered less severe than the 
primary injury are not included in 
NEISS-AIP. NEISS-AIP provides data 
on ∼500 000 injury-related ED visits 
each year.8
For this analysis, cases in which 
persons aged ≤14 years visited an 
ED for a playground-related injury 
were abstracted from NEISS-AIP 
data. They were identified by using 
the playground consumer products 
involved in accordance with the CPSC 
NEISS coding manual (eg, monkey 
bars, playground gyms, swings).15 
Deaths and intentional injuries, 
including self-harm and violence-
related injuries, were excluded.
A 2-stage strategy was used to 
identify cases of playground-related 
TBI. Playground injuries were 
classified as TBI if the primary 
body part injured was the head and 
the principal diagnosis was either 
concussion or internal organ injury.8, 
15 
This yielded 6259 unweighted 
cases that met the case definition. 
Next, narratives of all unintentional, 
nonfatal TBI cases were queried for 
the following keywords: playground, 
slide, sliding board, swing, monkey 
bars, seesaw, or teeter totter, based 
on the playground equipment 
product codes in the CPSC manual, 
to identify additional playground-
related cases lacking a playground 
consumer product code (n = 1920).15 
All cases were then manually 
reviewed to confirm that the TBI 
indeed occurred on a playground 
and were excluded if the narrative 
described other circumstances of 
injury in addition to playground, as 
it would be difficult to determine 
which contributed to the TBI. This 
manual review yielded a total of 6900 
unweighted playground-related TBI 
cases.
Other variables examined included 
discharge disposition, injury location, 
type of playground equipment, month 
of ED visit, and day of the week of 
treatment. The discharge disposition 
of persons after an ED visit was 
categorized as treated and released, 
hospitalized or transferred, or other.

The hospitalized or transferred 
category includes persons who were 
admitted to the hospital after the 
ED visit as well as those transferred 
to another facility for additional 
care. The other category includes 
dispositions listed as observed, left 
against medical advice, left without 
being seen, and unknown. The 
playground equipment variable was 
categorized in accordance with the 
CPSC playground product codes (ie, 
monkey bars or playground gyms, 
swings or swing sets, slides or sliding 
boards, seesaws or teeter totters). 
Cases were categorized as other/
unknown if the product codes other 
or unspecified were listed and if 
the narrative did not specify a type 
of playground equipment involved 
with the injury. Last, cases from the 
manual review were categorized as 
non–playground equipment if the 
narrative indicated that the injury 
occurred on a playground but did not 
involve playground equipment.
Each case of playground-related 
injury was assigned a sample weight 
based on the inverse probability 
of selection. These weights were 
added in accordance with the 
sampling scheme to provide 
national estimates of playground-
related injuries. National estimates 
for January 1, 2001, through 
December 31, 2013, were based 
on weighted data for 2 793 475 ED 
visits for all playground-related 
injuries among persons aged 0 to 
14 years, of which 274 307 (6900 
unweighted) were TBIs. To derive 
annual average estimates, weighted 
data for each year from 2001 to 
2013 were summed and divided by 
13. US Census yearly bridged-race 
population estimates for 2001 to 
2013 for persons aged ≤14 years 
were used as the denominator to 
compute rates of playground-related 
TBI and playground-related injury 
per 100 000 population.16 Rates are 
reported only for the age, gender, 
and discharge disposition, similar 
to previous publications with NEISS 
data.8 Confidence intervals (CIs) were 
calculated by using a direct variance 
estimation procedure that accounted 
for the sample weights and complex 
sample design according to CPSC 
recommendations.13 Estimates 
with coefficients of variation >30%, 
a weighted estimate of <1200, or 
unweighted count of <20 were 
considered unstable. The rates and 
CIs for unstable estimates are not 
reported.
Data were analyzed by using SAS, 
version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, 
NC) and Joinpoint, version 4.1.0 
software (Statistical Methodology 
and Applications Branch, Surveillance 
Research Program, National Cancer 
Institute, Bethesda, MD). SAS and 
Joinpoint linear weighted regression 
analyses were used to analyze the 
best-fitting join-point and the annual 
modeled rate change (slope). These 
models were used to indicate the 
magnitude and direction of the 
trends of estimated playground-
related TBI ED visit rates for each 
segment or period.
RESULTS
From 2001 to 2013, an annual 
average of 214 883 persons aged 
≤14 years were treated in EDs for 
playground-related injuries; of these, 
21 101 were treated for TBI (9.8%) 
(Table 1). Of the playground-related 
TBI ED visits, boys accounted for 
58.6% and persons aged 5 to 9 years 
accounted for 50.6%. Overall, 95.6% 
were treated and released, and 2.6% 
were hospitalized or transferred for 
further care. Approximately two-
thirds of playground-related TBIs 
occurred at places of recreation or 
sports (33.5%) and school (32.5%). 
Monkey bars or playground gyms 
(28.3%) and swings (28.1%) were 
the most frequently reported 
equipment associated with a TBI. 
Playground-related TBI ED visits 
occurred frequently during the 
months of April (11.7%), May 
(12.9%), and September (11.8%). 
Approximately 77.9% of ED visits 
occurred during weekdays, Monday 
through Friday (Table 1).
The best-fitting Joinpoint model for 
playground-related TBIs was 2 line 
segments joined at the year 2005 (Fig 
1). From 2001 to 2005, the annual 
modeled rate change (slope = –2.1; 
P > .05) nominally decreased; whereas 
in the second segment, from 2005 
to 2013, the estimated rate trend 
increased significantly (slope = 3.7; 
P < .05) (Fig 1). For all playground-
related injuries, from 2001 to 2006, 
the estimated rate trend decreased 
significantly (slope = –11.04; P < .05) 
and then increased significantly from 
2006 to 2013 (slope = 9.48; P < .05). 
For persons aged 0 to 4 years, from 
2001 to 2013, the estimated rate 
trend increased significantly (slope = 
2.1; P < .05) (Fig 2). For persons 
aged 5 to 9 years, from 2001 to 2006, 
the estimated rate trend nominally 
decreased (slope = –2.3; P > .05) 
and then increased significantly 
from 2006 to 2013 (slope = 5.9; 
P < .05) (Fig 2). For persons aged 
10 to 14 years, from 2001 to 2006, 
the estimated rate trend nominally 
decreased (slope = –1.0; P > .05) and 
then increased significantly from 
2006 to 2013 (slope = 2.6; P < .05) 
(Fig 2).
The average annual number (AAN) of 
ED visits for playground-related TBIs 
varied by age group and equipment 
type (Table 2). Among persons aged 
0 to 4 years, 31% of TBI-related ED 
visits involved swings (AAN 2242; 
CI 1516–2968) and 26% involved 
sliding boards (1857; CI 1333–2380). 
For persons aged 5 to 9 years, 34% 
of ED visits involved monkey bars 
or playground gyms (AAN 3639; 
CI 2243–5034) and 24% involved 
swings (AAN 2577; CI 1988–3166). 
Approximately 34% of TBI-related 
ED visits among persons 10 to 14 
years involved swings (AAN 1111; 
CI 885–1336) and 29% involved 
monkey bars or playground gyms 
(AAN 957; CI 686–1229). For 
persons aged 0 to 4 years, 41% of

playground-related TBIs occurred 
at places of recreation or sports 
(AAN 2888; CI 1975–3800), whereas 
persons aged 5 to 9 years (AAN 4464; 
CI 2701–6228) and 10 to 14 years 
(AAN 1261; CI 925–1598) sustained 
TBIs more frequently at school 
(Table 2).
DISCUSSION
TBIs sustained on playgrounds 
continue to be a public health 
concern despite the establishment 
of ASTM and CPSC standards. This 
study indicates that ED visits for 
playground-related TBIs increased 
significantly from 2005 to 2013, a 
finding similar to that of a previous 
CDC analysis of all sports and 
recreation-related TBI ED visits 
among persons aged ≤19 years.8 
The CDC report estimated that from 
2001 to 2009, the rate of all sports 
and recreation-related TBI ED visits 
increased 57% and that playground 
activities accounted for the highest 
estimated number of ED visits among 
the activities examined.
Several factors might account for 
the rise of ED visits for playground-
related TBI among persons aged 
≤14 years, including increased 
participation in playground activities 
or increased TBI incidence over time. 
It is also plausible that heightened 
public awareness of TBI and 
concussions has prompted parents to 
seek medical care for their children 
in the event of a head injury, when 
previously they would not have done 
so. Similarly, heightened awareness 
might lead health care providers 
to consider a TBI diagnosis after 
head injury. Various efforts could 
account for heightened awareness, 
including (1) educational initiatives 
such as CDC’s Heads Up, 
17 (2) media 
coverage of sports concussion, (3) 
state laws regarding concussions and 
return-to-play, 
18 and (4) the issue 
of TBI among military personnel 
returning from Iraq and Afghanistan 
deployments.19 However, similar 
to past studies during this time

period on ED visits for sports and 
recreation-related TBIs, the results of 
our study do not suggest that injuries 
sustained on playgrounds have 
become more severe: >90% of cases 
(Table1) are treated and released 
from EDs annually on average.8, 
20 Most cases for other playground 
injuries were also treated and 
released annually (Table 1).
Higher rates of playground-related 
TBI ED visits were found among boys 
and persons aged 5 to 9 years (Table 
1). Many of these TBIs involved 
monkey bars or playground gyms 
and occurred at school and places 
of recreation and sports (Table 
2). These findings corroborate 
the results of previous research.6, 
21–23 Other studies also found that 
climbing equipment, slides, and 
swings account for most playground 
injuries.7 These findings might be 
expected because with increasing 
age, children engage in more 
challenging play. After age 9, children 
may lose interest in playgrounds as 
they enter adolescence. Additionally, 
children aged 5 to 9 years are in 
grade school where playgrounds 
are often accessible and, thus, 
increase exposure time and risk 
of injury. Grade school recreation 
might also explain the higher rate 
of playground-related TBI ED visits 
that occurred Monday through Friday 
compared with Saturday and Sunday 
(Table 1).
Although caregiver supervision 
can play an important role in child 
injury prevention, not all risks can 
be addressed by this strategy.24 
Methods to reduce a child’s risky 
play on playgrounds may also help 
lessen the burden of these injuries.25 
Supervision to ensure proper use 
of equipment and modification of 
childhood behavior, however, need 
to be augmented by environmental 
modifications such as those outlined 
by ASTM F1292. According to the 
results of this study, standard ASTM 
F1292 for playground surfaces 
appears to be effective, as few 
deaths from head and neck injuries 
have occurred in recent years.5, 
6 
However, our study also suggests 
that standards for playground 
construction and surfacing need to be 
continually reviewed and modified 
to reduce the risk of all TBIs and 
not just severe head injury and 
death.5, 
26 Additionally, playgrounds 
should be regularly inspected for 
safety hazards in accordance with 
the CPSC Handbook for Playground 
Safety.6 For example, the handbook 
states that maintenance inspections 
should occur particularly in high

children at risk for disability even if 
their injury is diagnosed as a mild 
TBI or concussion.10–12, 
27
This study is subject to at least 5 
limitations. First, in the NEISS-AIP 
system only the principal diagnosis 
and primary body part injured are 
abstracted from ED records for 
each visit. TBIs documented as a 
secondary diagnosis or considered 
less severe than the primary injury 
are not included. Second, the NEISS 
TBI definition has a sensitivity of 
79.6% (95% CI 68.9%–90.4%) 
but a specificity of 99.0% (95% 
CI 98.4– 99.7%).28 Therefore, as a 
result of these first 2 limitations, 
this report underestimates the 
burden of playground-related TBI ED 
visits. Third, the lack of playground 
equipment exposure data prevented 
calculation of equipment-related 
injury rates. This would have been 
helpful to determine what equipment 
type poses the greatest danger. 
Fourth, we could not determine the 
association between playground 
equipment and TBI compared with 
other injuries because the risk of 
each equipment type could not 
be accounted for as previously 
described. Last, NEISS-AIP narrative 
descriptions do not provide 
detailed information about injury 
circumstances, such as playground 
surfacing and risk behaviors. As a 
result, NEISS-AIP cannot be used to 
assess the impact of these factors on 
injury incidence.
CONCLUSIONS
Playgrounds are a place of recreation 
for children and contribute to 
their growth and development, but 
these benefits are accompanied by 
the risk for injury. TBIs sustained 
during childhood could have 
implications for physical and 
cognitive development, depending 
on the child’s age and severity of the 
injury.2, 
12 Therefore, strategies to 
reduce the incidence and severity of 
TBIs sustained on playgrounds are 
needed. Improvements in playground 
environmental safety that also 
address design, surfacing, and 
maintenance can help accomplish 
this. Such measures, in addition 
to appropriate supervision and 
child behavior modification, are 
particularly important for persons 
aged 5 to 9 years who have a rate of 
playground-related TBI surpassing 
that of other age groups. Also, studies 
examining risk factors for TBI on 
playgrounds would help to inform 
primary prevention strategies.
