Aim
The aim is to assess the effects of CDCs on heart structure, function, gene expression, and systemic parameters in
aged rats. Diastolic dysfunction is characteristic of aged hearts. Cardiosphere-derived cell (CDC) therapy has
exhibited several favourable effects on heart structure and function in humans and in preclinical models; however,
the effects of CDCs on aging have not been evaluated.

Methods
and Results
We compared intra-cardiac injections of neonatal rat CDCs to vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline, PBS) in
21.8 ± 1.6 month-old rats (mean ± standard deviation; n = 23 total). Ten rats 4.1 ± 1.5 months of age comprised a
young reference group. Blood, echocardiographic, haemodynamic and treadmill stress tests were performed at
baseline in all animals, and 1 month after treatment in old animals. Histology and the transcriptome
were assessed after terminal phenotyping. For in vitro studies, human heart progenitors from older donors, or
cardiomyocytes from aged rats were exposed to human CDCs or exosomes secreted by CDCs (CDC-XO)
from paediatric donors. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that CDCs, but not PBS, recapitulated a youthful pat-
tern of gene expression in the hearts of old animals (85.5% of genes differentially expressed, P < 0.05).
Telomeres in heart cells were longer in CDC-transplanted animals (P < 0.0001 vs. PBS). Cardiosphere-derived
cells attenuated hypertrophy by echo (P < 0.01); histology confirmed decreases in cardiomyocyte area
(P < 0.0001) and myocardial fibrosis (P < 0.05) vs. PBS. Cardiosphere-derived cell injection improved diastolic
dysfunction [lower E/A (P < 0.01), E/E’ (P = 0.05), end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship (P < 0.05) compared
with baseline), and lowered serum brain natriuretic peptide (both P < 0.05 vs. PBS). In CDC-transplanted old
rats, exercise capacity increased �20% (P < 0.05 vs. baseline), body weight decreased �30% less (P = 0.05 vs.
PBS) and hair regrowth after shaving was more robust (P < 0.05 vs. PBS). Serum biomarkers of inflammation (IL-
10, IL-1b, and IL-6) improved in the CDC group (P < 0.05 for each, all vs. PBS). Young CDCs secrete exosomes
which increase telomerase activity, elongate telomere length, and reduce the number of senescent human heart
cells in culture.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................
Conclusion
Young CDCs rejuvenate old animals as gauged by cardiac gene expression, heart function, exercise capacity, and
systemic biomarkers.

Introduction
Cardiovascular disease increases markedly in prevalence with aging,
creating a huge economic burden.1 Cell senescence underlies the
aging process,2 and is characterized by progressive shortening of telo-
meres.3 Critical shortening of these protective ‘caps’ on the ends of
linear chromosomes is associated with heart dysfunction and hyper-
trophy,4 impaired cardiomyocyte proliferation, and reduced regener-
ative capacity.5 The aged heart exhibits abnormal relaxation and/or
increased stiffness,6,7 along with interstitial fibrosis and cardiomyo-
cyte hypertrophy, increasing the risk of heart failure with preserved
ejection fraction (HFpEF).8 Among rejuvenating strategies tested to
date, parabiosis9 and cellular reprogramming10 seem promising, but
none has addressed age-related heart dysfunction.
Cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) are cardiac progenitor cells
which can differentiate into the three major cell types present in the
heart, that is, cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle
cells.11 Despite their progenitor status, CDCs work primarily indi-
rectly12 (see Supplementary material online, Reference 1). They have
been demonstrated to normalize left ventricular relaxation and dia-
stolic pressure while improving survival in young Dahl salt-sensitive
rats with hypertensive HFpEF.13 In this and other preclinical studies,
CDCs mitigated inflammation, fibrosis and oxidative stress in diseased
heart tissue.14,15 CDCs are also being tested clinically; data available to
date indicate that they are safe, and may lead to improvements in
post-ischaemic cardiac structure and function indicative of therapeutic
regeneration.16 Based on this, we hypothesized that aged hearts char-
acterized by fibrosis, myocardial hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction,
and chronic inflammation would benefit from therapy with CDCs. To
test our hypothesis, we evaluated the effects of CDCs on age-related
heart dysfunction and examined the broader rejuvenating potential of
CDCs in a well-established rat model of senescence.
Methods
Animals and in vivo study protocol
Old Fisher 344 rats (21.8 ± 1.6 month old) were obtained from the
National Institute of Aging. Younger Fishe 344 rats (4.1± 1.5 month old)
were purchased from Envigo, Indianapolis, IN, USA. All F344 lines avail-
able in the USA are from the same origin (Columbia University), so share
the same genetic background. All animals were studied in accordance
with the local guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee as pub-
lished by the National Institute of Health (NIH Publication No. 86-23,
revised 1996).
Younger animals were used for the characterization of structural and
functional changes related to aging. After initial phenotyping with echocar-
diography and exercise testing, old animals were divided into two groups
that were matched prospectively for comparable baseline properties:
Twelve rats were treated with CDCs, and 11 rats received phosphate-buf-
fered saline (PBS, i.e. vehicle control). Prior to administration of CDCs or
PBS, rats underwent invasive haemodynamic evaluation of left ventricular
(LV) pressure and volume and aortic pressure. Old animals were evaluated
at baseline and 1month later by echocardiography, invasive haemodynam-
ics, and exercise treadmill testing for structural and functional changes.
Blood samples were collected at the same time points. After 1month, ani-
mals were euthanized and hearts were harvested for further testing.
Isolation, expansion, and injection of
cardiosphere-derived cells
Hearts were excised from 31 Sprague-Dawley neonatal rats to produce
CDCs, as described.17 Rats in the CDC group received 1� 106 passage 2
CDCs resuspended in 100mL of PBS into the LV cavity with simultaneous
aortic clamping (5 rats) or intramyocardially, divided among four injection
sites (anterior, lateral, posterior walls and apex (7 rats). The same delivery
strategies were used in the control group: intracavitary (LV, 5 rats) and intra-
myocardial (6 rats). No major differences were observed in the end points,
and CDCs’ cardiac engraftment is similar (see Supplementary material online,
Reference 2) with the two delivery strategies, so pooled results are presented.
Functional, histological, and molecular
studies
Detailed descriptions of all the studies are available in the Supplementary
Material online.
In vitro studies
When minced human heart tissue is grown in primary culture, it sponta-
neously gives rise to monolayers of cardiac stromal/progenitor cells
(CSPCs).17 Cardiosphere-derived cells from human donors >55years of
age (old CSPCs) were used to assess human cardiac senescence in vitro.
Cardiomyocytes were isolated from old rats (24 months) by enzymatic
dissociation of the ventricles as described (see Supplementary material
online, Reference 3). Human and rat cells were (separately) targeted with
CDCs and exosomes secreted by CDCs or (CDC-XO) obtained from
paediatric (<2years of age) human donors (young CDCs or CDC-XO).
For more detailed explanation, see Supplementary Material online.
Statistical analysis
All results are presented as mean ± standard deviation (± SEM in figures)
or percentages, for continuous and categorical variables, respectively.
Significance of differences was assessed by Student t-test or with one-way
Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA) in case of multiple groups if the distribu-
tion of the variable was normal; otherwise, the Mann–Whitney or
Kruskal–Wallis tests were used. Paired t-test was used to determine sig-
nificance between baseline and end point in the same group of animals.
Age-related changes in three age groups were estimated by linear regres-
sion analysis. Based on our previous results (�10± 5% of differences in
the functional tests between experimental groups), a sample size of 10
Translational perspective
In senescent rats, we tested the idea that treatment with cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) from young donors might antag-
onize diastolic dysfunction and other consequences of aging. Allogeneic CDCs improved diastolic function and induced sys-
temic functional improvements (notably, increased exercise tolerance) in old animals. Rejuvenating effects were likewise
evident in human heart cells from older donors, co-cultured with young CDCs. Given that allogeneic CDCs are already in
advanced clinical testing and have proven safe to date, progress to clinical testing is highly feasible.

animals per group (assuming a 5% significance level and an 80% power
level) was estimated, using a statistical software program (GB-Stat
Version 10.0, Dynamic Microsystems Inc). Gene expression was analysed
online, using QIAGEN data analysis centre [http://www.qiagen.com/us/
shop/genes-and-pathways/data-analysis-center-overview-page/rt2-pro
filer-pcr-arrays-data-analysis-center (August 2017)]. All probability values
reported are two-sided, with P < 0.05 considered significant. IBM SPSS
Statistics 20 was used for all analyses. For in vitro studies, the lowest
number of replicates per experiment was 3.
Results
We first characterized the animal model in terms of age-related
structural and functional changes (see Supplementary material online,
Figure S1). Aging was associated with progressive diastolic dysfunction
(see Supplementary material online, Figure S1a–e and n) with pre-
served systolic function (see Supplementary material online, Figure
S1h, i, and n), and steady increases of LV mass and LV diameter (see
Supplementary material online, Figure S1f, g, and n). Blood pressure
did not differ significantly among age groups (see Supplementary
material online, Figure S1j and n), but exercise capacity decreased
with aging (see Supplementary material online, Figure S1m and n).
Functional improvement of the heart:
cardiosphere-derived cells decrease
stiffness and improve relaxation of the
left ventricle
Figure 1A shows representative images of transmitral blood flow and
tissue Doppler in PBS- and CDC-injected rats. After 1month, old rats
that had been transplanted with CDCs (but not those that had
received only PBS) showed a decrease of E/A (from 4.2± 1.8 at base-
line to 2.1± 0.4, P< 0.01) and E/E’ ratios (from 22.6± 5.2 at baseline to
16.3± 4.3, P= 0.05), back towards values seen in young rats (Figure 1B).
Serial invasive haemodynamic measurements confirmed the echocar-
diographic findings. Figure 1C shows examples of pressure–volume loops
before and 1month after injection of PBS or CDCs in old animals. Such
data were used to derive the slope of the LV end-diastolic pressure–vol-
ume relationship (EDPVR). Cardiosphere-derived cell treatment (but
not PBS) decreased EDPVR after 1month (Figure 1D, upper panel), indi-
cating improved stiffness. The time constant of relaxation Tau (Figure 1D,
lower panel) was abbreviated in CDC-transplanted rats 1month post-
injection (22.2± 3.5ms vs. 26.9± 6.0ms in PBS, P< 0.05, respectively).
Minimum dP/dT values showed a similar trend as Tau, but did not reach
statistical significance (see Supplementary material online, Figure S2).
No significant differences or evolving changes were observed in LV
systolic function, which was normal in both groups at baseline (frac-
tional shortening of �38% and ejection fraction of �66%, with no dif-
ferences in the slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship
between groups; see Supplementary material online, Figure S2).
Structural changes of the heart:
cardiosphere-derived cells regress left
ventricular hypertrophy and are
associated with less fibrosis
Figure 2A shows typical LV M-Mode images before and 1 month after
injection of PBS or CDCs. After intervention in old rats, wall
thickness decreased in the CDC group (P < 0.01 for interventricular
septum and LV posterior wall) with borderline reduction of LV mass
(Figure 2B, see Supplementary material online, Figure S2), but PBS
injection had no evident effect. The echocardiographic changes were
supported by the histological finding of smaller cross-sectional cardi-
omyocyte area after CDC vs. PBS injection (P < 0.0001, Figure 2C and
D). Similar reductions in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy with CDCs
have been observed in post-ischaemic heart failure.18
Additionally, cardiac fibrosis, assayed by Masson’s trichrome stain-
ing (Figure 2E and F), was reduced in rats transplanted with CDCs
compared with control. Figure 2F shows that overall fractional fibrotic
area dropped from 7.3% vs. 4.4% (P < 0.05), an effect which reflected
reductions of scar throughout the heart. Finally, serum levels of brain
natriuretic peptide (BNP), which is known to rise in human aging,
increased with age in our study, but further increases post-injection
were blunted by treatment with CDCs (Figure 2G).
Cardiosphere-derived cells induce
biological rejuvenation of the heart
We analysed the expression of 168 genes implicated in tissue aging
and cellular senescence pathways in whole-heart extracts from
young rats, and from old rats treated with CDCs or PBS (Figure 3).
Comparing the transcriptomes of CDC- and PBS-injected rats, signifi-
cant differences were detected in 37% of the genes (Figure 3A and B).
Most of the CDC-related changes (85.5%) directionally recapitulated
the gene expression patterns of young animals (Figure 3C). Among
the genes affected, those implicated in cell cycle control (e.g., E2f1
and Rbl1) and immune response (e.g., Fcer1g and Lrf7) figured most
prominently (Figure 3D).
We found that cardiac telomeres were longer at study end-point
in CDC-injected animals (P < 0.0001 vs. PBS controls; Figure 4A and
B). About half of cells in the PBS group had extremely short telo-
meres (within the lowest quartile of length), compared with only
10% in CDC-injected rats (Figure 4Biii). In contrast, �40% of heart
cells in the CDC group were within the highest quartile of telomere
length (compared with <10% in PBS-injected animals). Findings were
similar when telomere length was evaluated specifically in cardiomyo-
cytes (Figure 4C), with longer mean length in CDC-injected rats
(P < 0.0001 vs. PBS, Figure 4Cii) and an inverse telomere length distri-
bution between the two groups (P < 0.0001, Figure 4Ciii).
Cardiosphere-derived cells cause
favourable systemic effects
As described (see Supplementary material online, Reference 4), aging
was associated with a marked decrease of exercise capacity
(P < 0.001, see Supplementary material online, Figure S1m). In the
aged rats, treadmill exercise capacity increased by �25% in the
month after CDC injection (107.8 ± 25.5 m to 128.6 ± 12.4m;
P < 0.05), but changed little in PBS-injected old animals (Figure 5A).
Weight loss secondary to sarcopenia or cachexia, compounded by
surgery, also appeared to be responsive to CDCs: PBS-injected rats
lost �30% more body weight in the post-operative month compared
with CDC-transplanted animals (P = 0.05, Figure 5B). As systemic bio-
markers of inflammation, interleukins (IL) 6, and 1b are known com-
ponents of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)
which is implicated in propagation of the aging process.19 Serum

levels of these ILs and other inflammatory cytokines were higher in
old rats than in young animals (see Supplementary material online,
Figure S4A), but CDC therapy lowered IL-1b and IL-6 levels (by 25%
and 60%, respectively) compared with control rats at the study end
point (Figure 5C). In eight animals, serum samples were available both
at baseline and study end point, showing a five-fold decrease of IL-6
levels in CDC-treated rats. Heart and renal functions are closely cor-
related in the clinical entity of cardio-renal syndrome,20 which is
prominent in elderly patients. Both serum creatinine (sCr) and blood
urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were higher in old than in young rats (see
Supplementary material online, Figure S4C and D). Levels of sCr
decreased in CDC-injected old rats (P < 0.05) over the month post-

intervention, despite less body weight loss than in PBS-injected
animals. Taken together with the minimal decrease of BUN levels in
the CDC group versus an increase in the control rats (see
Supplementary material online, Figure S4B), estimated glomerular fil-
tration rate increased in the CDC-transplanted animals (Figure 5D).
Also, we observed an unexpected increase in the rate of hair
regrowth after shaving in animals that had received CDCs relative to
those injected with PBS (Figure 5E and F; see Supplementary material
online, Figure S5). The improvements in exercise capacity, body mass,
inflammatory cytokines, renal function and hair growth reveal that
the rejuvenating benefits of CDCs are not limited to, or specific for,
the cardiovascular system. Finally, serum levels of GDF 11, proposed
as a systemic rejuvenating factor,9 were comparable in our experi-
mental groups (see Supplementary material online, Figure S6), making
it unlikely that this molecule plays an important role in CDC-
associated rejuvenation.

Exosomes as mediators of anti-senescent
effects of cardiosphere-derived cells
Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that telomerase activa-
tion and related telomere elongation underlie the anti-senescent
effects observed here in old rats. We wanted to test this idea, and to
do so in human cells in order to exclude rodent-specific effects. To
assay the potential anti-aging effects of young CDCs on old human
heart cells, we primed CSPCs obtained from>55-year-old donors
with young (donors <2 years of age) CDCs, resuspended in serum-
free conditioned media, using a transwell co-culture system.
Telomerase was almost inactive in old CSPCs but its activity
increased four-fold after 96h of transwell culture with young CDCs,
compared with control (Figure 6A). Many, if not most, effects of
CDCs are mediated by secreted exosomes. A blocker of exosome
release, GW4869 (20 uM), abrogated the telomerase-activating
effect of CDCs (Figure 6A). Furthermore, old CSPCs primed with
exosomes isolated from young CDCs (CDC-XO) exhibited a six-
fold increase of telomerase activity (Figure 6A). Both lines of evidence
support the notion that exosomes mediate young CDC-induced
telomerase activation.
One of the main functions of telomerase is telomere lengthening
with associated cellular rejuvenation.21 We further tested both
effects in old CSPCs. Telomeres were longer (Figure 6B) and the
number of senescence-associated b-galactosidase positive (SA-
GALþ) CSPCs were lower (Figure 6C) in young CDC-XO primed
cells compared with control cells after 96h.
To investigate whether these effects are seen in working myocar-
dial cells, we tested the effects of young CDC-XO on ventricular car-
diomyocytes

from
old
(24 month

rats
(see
Supplementary material online, Figure S7). The proportion of senes-
cent SA-GALþ cells was lower in CDC-XO-primed cardiomyocytes
than in control cells (P < 0.05; see Supplementary material online,
Figure S7A), accompanied by a two-fold increase of borderline statisti-
cal significance in telomerase activity after 72 h (see Supplementary
material online, Figure S7B). We analysed short- and long-term sur-
vival of a-sarcomeric actinin positive cardiomyocytes and observed a
progressive decrease in the number of cells in the control group after
24 h, but preservation of the initial number of plated cardiomyocytes
in the CDC-XO-primed group (see Supplementary material online,
Figure S7C).

Discussion
Here we documented the ability of cell therapy to attenuate age-
related diastolic dysfunction and structural changes. Unexpectedly,
we also found broadly favourable systemic effects of CDCs in old ani-
mals, despite the fact that the cells were delivered to the heart. The
in vivo findings are supported by in vitro demonstration of novel
exosome-mediated anti-senescent properties, yielding mechanistic
insights into the anti-aging effects of young CDCs (Figure 7).
Cardiac and vascular aging prominently affect diastolic function.22
Left ventricular diastolic stiffness increases with normal aging in
humans, even in the absence of hypertension,23 a phenomenon also
observed here and previously in aging rats. Longitudinal echocardio-
graphic assessments reveal prominent age-related myocardial hyper-
trophy.24 Aging hearts exhibit myocyte hypertrophy, increased
myocyte apoptosis, interstitial and subendocardial fibrosis, and amy-
loid deposition as consequences of multiple senescence-related path-
ways.25 Cardiosphere-derived cells increased telomere length,
recapitulated a young gene expression pattern, decreased interstitial
fibrosis and attenuated hypertrophy. Meanwhile, diastolic function
improved, in association with lower levels of circulating BNP in
CDC-injected rats.
Telomere shortening is a biomarker of lifetime stress, and telo-
mere attrition is responsible for accelerated aging.3,21 Moreover,
telomere dysfunction is a popular target for interventions to aug-
ment the regenerative capacity of mammalian hearts, given that
telomeres figure prominently in cardiomyocyte cell-cycle arrest
after birth.5 Here, telomere length of heart cells globally, and of
cardiomyocytes specifically, was greater in old animals trans-
planted with CDCs obtained from very young rats compared with
placebo (PBS). Telomerase is activated in the neonatal mammalian
heart26 and is required for heart regeneration in zebrafish.27 We
found that telomerase activity was increased in old human heart
progenitor cells and in senescent rat cardiomyocytes primed with
young CDCs. These effects were mediated in a paracrine manner
by CDC-secreted exosomes. Telomerase activation was associ-
ated with telomere elongation, decreased cell senescence and car-
dioprotection in culture. Our results indicate that telomere
elongation with CDCs is not exclusive to cardiomyocytes.
Although non-cardiomyocyte heart cell populations were not
specifically characterized in this study, rejuvenation of any type of
cell, defined by the presence of longer telomeres, will likely be
beneficial from a functional point of view. Specifically, senescence
of fibroblasts may contribute to diastolic dysfunction by favouring
their transformation into proinflammatory myofibroblasts, with
consequent adverse extracellular matrix remodelling and secre-
tion of inflammatory cytokines.28
Circulating levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-1b and IL-6 were
decreased, accompanied by an increase of anti-inflammatory IL-10
levels in old CDC-treated animals. Thus, CDCs antagonize the SASP,
which contributes to a spiral of increasing inflammation, dysfunction,
and age-related diseases.29 Attenuation of SASP may underlie the
Figure 7 Schematic depiction of heart aging and proposed mechanisms whereby young CDCs exert anti-senescent effects. The process of aging is
depicted in the upper row. Transplanted CDCs secrete exosomes (CDC-XO) which lead to cellular rejuvenation. In the heart, left ventricular hyper-
trophy (LVH) is attenuated and fibrosis is decreased, leading to improved diastolic function. Systemically, a reduction of the senescence-associated
secretory phenotype (SASP) contributes to systemic benefits. Although not shown here, we cannot rule out remote effects of CDCs or CDC-
secreted exosomes on target tissues, independent of SASP.

observed improvements in exercise capacity, sarcopenia, hair
regrowth and renal function. The systemic benefits of CDC therapy
discovered here, notably the sizable increase of functional capacity,
are remarkable in that they transcend mere localized correction of
single-organ dysfunction. The marked systemic benefits on hair
regrowth, renal function and exercise capacity appear disproportion-
ate to the improvements in cardiac performance. The systemic
improvements are all the more striking for having occurred remote
from the focused site of delivery of the CDCs into the heart. While
we have not explored the mechanism of the remote effects, it is not
unreasonable to hypothesize contributions from CDCs that may
have leaked into the systemic circulation, and/or secretion of exo-
somes from embedded CDCs. Systemic spread of exosomes has
been implicated in various long-range signalling processes, including
the skeletal myopathy that accompanies heart failure.30 In our sce-
nario, the proposed long-range signalling differs in that it would be
salutary rather than detrimental.
Study limitations
Maximum life span in this rat strain is �2.5years, and we studied
�22-month-old animals. Thus, our 1-month follow-up does not suf-
fice to determine if the observed changes are maintained over time,
or whether longevity is affected. In addition, extrapolation to humans
should be made only cautiously. Although we selected a naturally-
aged animal model containing many similarities to normal human
aging,8,9 we did not consider frequent comorbidities such as hyper-
tension, and associated treatments, which may influence the response
to cell therapy. We did, however, confirm that CDCs and their exo-
somes antagonize human heart cell aging in vitro. Additionally,
although all of the functional studies were performed sequentially,
allowing us to evaluate CDC-induced changes in the same animal, his-
topathological evaluation was done only at study end-point, so only
differences between groups at that specific time point could be
assessed. The detailed specific antifibrotic and antihypertrophic
mechanisms were not evaluated, being beyond the scope of this
article, but the implication of exosomes does tie in mechanistically to
previous work showing exosome-mediated reductions in cardiac fib-
rosis and hypertrophy.12,31 Finally, the design of this study does not
establish if the rejuvenating properties shown here are seen only
with young CDCs, so the efficacy of adult cells, demonstrated in
other studies (see Supplementary material online, References 5 and 6)
should be further tested.
Conclusions
The present findings motivate further translational studies of rejuve-
nation by CDC therapy. If such follow-up studies are promising, prog-
ress to clinical testing may be highly feasible, given that allogeneic
CDCs are already in advanced clinical testing and have proven safe to
date.11
