ompared with the 1980s unemployment rate in Japan 
(2%), in the 1990s, the rate began to increase to 4.1% in 
1998, reaching a peak of 5.4% in 2002.1 The health adverse 
effects of unemployment are well established2; job loss was 
associated with a higher proportion of depressive symptoms3 
and increased risks of myocardial infarction,4–9 stroke,4–6,9–12 
and all-cause mortality.6,13 However, a little is known about the 
effects of returning to work on health,14–16 that was focusing on 
mental health15,16 rather than on physical health.17 Apart from 
2,10,16 the previous studies were conducted in Western coun-
tries, which have different social contexts in terms of labor 
market policies, perhaps making them less applicable to East 
Asian countries.
Some studies provided evidence that reemployed people 
enjoyed a partial psychological recovery from a job loss 
experience, but with no change on their physical health.15–17 
Conversely, reemployed subjects had a high risk of death in 
another prospective study.13 Japanese employees who lost 
their jobs were at high chances to be reemployed in unsatis-
factory jobs18 that might increase their stroke risk.19 No studies 
have yet been conducted to examine a sex-specific long-term 
effect of reemployment on risk of stroke incidence and mor-
tality, which are known to be influenced by the employment 
status4–6,9–11,19 or the associations of job loss and reemployment 
with risk of stroke types (hemorrhagic and ischemic).
We hypothesized that changes in employment status may 
have an impact on risk of stroke, and we aimed to examine 
that in Japanese men and women.
Materials and Methods
Design and Population
The JPHC (Japan Public Health Center)–based prospective study was 
initiated in 1990 in 5 public health centers for cohort 1 and 6 public 
health centers in 1993 for cohort 2, with a total of 140 420 (men and 
Background and Purpose—Because of limited evidence, we investigated a long-term impact of changes in employment 
status on risk of stroke.
Methods—This was a prospective study of 21 902 Japanese men and 19 826 women aged 40 to 59 years from 9 public health 
centers across Japan. Participants were followed up from 1990 to 1993 to the end of 2009 to 2014. Cox proportional 
hazard ratio of stroke (incidence and mortality) and its types (hemorrhagic and ischemic) was calculated according 
to changes in the employment status within 5 years interval between 1990 to 1993 and 1995 to 1998 (continuously 
employed, job loss, reemployed, and continuously unemployed).
Results—During the follow-up period, 973 incident cases and 275 deaths from stroke in men and 460 cases and 131 deaths 
in women were documented. Experiencing 1 spell of unemployment was associated with higher risks of morbidity and 
mortality from total, hemorrhagic, and ischemic stroke in both men and women, even after propensity score matching. 
Compared with continuously employed subjects, the multivariable hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for total stroke 
incidence in job lost men was 1.58 (1.18–2.13) and in job lost women was 1.51 (1.08–2.29), and those for total stroke 
mortality were 2.22 (1.34–3.68) in men and 2.48 (1.26–4.77) in women. The respective hazard ratio (95% confidence 
interval) in reemployed men was 2.96 (1.89–4.62) for total stroke incidence and 4.21 (1.97–8.97) for mortality, whereas 
those in reemployed women were 1.30 (0.98–1.69) for incidence and 1.28 (0.76–2.17) for mortality.
Conclusions—Job lost men and women and reemployed men had increased risks for both hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke 
incidence and mortality.

women) aged 40 to 69 years. The details of the study cohort have 
been described elsewhere.20 Two public health center areas in met-
ropolitan Tokyo and Osaka were excluded from the present analy-
sis (n=23 524) because no data on stroke incidence were available. 
A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to all registered 
participants (response rate: 81.6%). A follow-up survey was con-
ducted 5 years after the first survey (response rate: 84.9%). A total of 
37 410 men and 38 401 women responded to both questionnaires. For 
this study, we set the dates of the first survey as our prebaseline and 
those of the second survey as our baseline to determine changes in 
the employment status between first and second surveys (Figure I in 
the online-only Data Supplement). For the purposes of this study, we 
limited our study population to those who were aged 45 to 59 years 
at baseline (the working age population; n=22 845 men and 22 122 
women). We excluded 101 men and 1206 women with no informa-
tion on their employment status and 842 men and 1090 women with 
a history of cancer or cardiovascular diseases at baseline. The final 
study population included 21 902 men and 19 826 women. The study 
was approved by the human ethics review committees of the National 
Cancer Center and Osaka University.
Employment Status Change
Change of employment status was identified by responses to the 
questions on employment status (employed including self-employed 
or unemployed) in both the prebaseline and baseline surveys. We 
categorized subjects into 4 groups: (1) continuously employed 
(employed at both the prebaseline and baseline surveys times), (2) 
job loss (employed at prebaseline time to unemployed at baseline 
time), (3) reemployed (unemployed at prebaseline time to employed 
at baseline time), and (4) continuously unemployed (unemployed at 
both prebaseline and baseline surveys times). We considered those 
who reported no job at prebaseline and got a job in the baseline sur-
vey as reemployed because it is unlikely for Japanese people to get 
their first job at age 45 to 59 years.
Other Covariates
Besides age and residential area, other hypothesized confounding 
factors were the prebaseline characteristics, including hypertension, 
diabetes mellitus statuses, and hypercholesterolemia which were 
determined from the responses to the prebaseline questions about 
medical histories and drug treatment, whereas the possible mediating 
factors were calculated from the responses to the baseline questions 
about the followings: perceived psychological stress evaluated via the 
responses to the question How much stress in your daily life? (little, 
average, large); perceived level of life enjoyment based on the subjec-
tive judgment on the participant’s sense of life enjoyment was evalu-
ated via a score according to the responses to the question Are you 
enjoying your life? (low, medium, high); changes in living arrange-
ment (no change versus changed living arrangement to live alone); 
quintiles of body mass index (BMI) calculated from reported height 
and weight (kg/m2); quintiles of metabolic equivalent in MET units for 
physical activity, smoking status (never, ex-smoker, current smoker 
of 1–19, 20–29, or ≥30 cigarettes per day); and ethanol intake (non-
drinkers, former drinkers, and weekly ethanol intake of <150 g/wk, 
 
150–<300 g/wk, 300–<450 g/wk, or ≥450 g/wk).
Confirmation of Stroke Incidence and Mortality
A total of 81 hospitals with the capability of treating stroke 
patients were registered within the administrative districts of the 
JPHC cohorts. Physicians blinded to the patients’ lifestyle data 
reviewed the medical records at each hospital. When subjects 
reported a history of stroke on a follow-up questionnaire (5 years 
after our baseline) and had not been registered as stroke cases, 
we asked by letter or telephone about the onset of stroke for per-
mission to review medical records and then review them. Strokes 
were confirmed according to the criteria of the National Survey of 
Stroke,21 and the widespread use of computed tomographic scans 
even in Japanese local hospitals since the 1980s has probably 
made the medical records diagnosis of stroke and its types suf-
ficiently accurate.22
All death certificates were forwarded centrally to the Ministry of 
Health, Welfare, and Labor; therefore, stroke death, defined according 
to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (codes 
I60 to I69), was confirmed even for relocated subjects. Detailed con-
firmation methods have been described elsewhere.20
Statistical Analyses
Stroke incidence and mortality were analyzed separately. For the 
analysis of stroke incidence, person-years were calculated from the 
date of the baseline January 1, 1995 in cohort 1, and January 1, 1998 
in cohort 2 until obtaining 1 of 4 possible end points: (1) incidence 
of first stroke, (2) relocation from the study area, (3) the end of the 
study; December 31, 2009 for cohort 1 and December 31, 2012 for 
cohort 2, or (4) death. For the analysis of stroke mortality, person-
years were censored at the date of stroke death, emigration from 
Japan, or the end of the study (December 31, 2014 in both cohorts 1 
and 2), whichever came first. For people who were lost to follow-up 
(n=168), the last confirmed date of their presence in the study areas 
was used as the date of censoring.
Mean values and proportions of participants’ characteristics were 
compared using the analysis of variance and the χ2 test. Hazard ratios 
(HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Cox 
proportional hazard regression analysis.
In the first model, we adjusted for age (continuous); in the sec-
ond model, we further adjusted for the hypothesized confound-
ing factors (prebaseline characteristics), and in the third model, we 
further adjusted for possible mediators (baseline characteristics); 
these characteristics might be considered consequences of changes 
in the employment status because such changes occurred before the 
baseline. Furthermore, to evaluate the effect of selection bias, we 
reanalyzed the data after running a propensity score matching for 
experiencing or not experiencing a spell of unemployment during 
the 5-year interval.23 Sensitivity analyses were done to guard against 
reverse causation by excluding early stroke incidence and mortality 
that occurred within 1 to 5 years of the baseline and to assess the 
effects of socioeconomic status by adjusting for education level for 
subjects in cohort 1 only, for whom information about educational 
level was available. All analyses were conducted using the SAS sta-
tistical package version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
Results
Compared with those who were continuously employed, men 
and women who experienced at least 1 spell of unemploy-
ment were more likely to smoke, to consume more alcohol, to 
be hypertensive and diabetics, and to live alone; jobless men 
and women were more likely to smoke and to be hypertensive 
and diabetics; reemployed men, in contrary to reemployed 
women, were more likely to live alone with higher perceived 
stress, whereas continuously unemployed men and women 
were more likely to be hypertensive. All such differences were 
statistically significant (Table 1).
During the mean follow-up period of 15 years, 973 cases 
of newly diagnosed stroke cases (396 hemorrhagic and 577 
ischemic) in men and 460 cases (133 hemorrhagic and 219 
ischemic) in women were documented, and during 17 years of 
mortality follow-up, 275 stroke deaths (169 hemorrhagic and 
49 ischemic) in men and 131 deaths (96 hemorrhagic and 16 
ischemic) in women were documented (Table 2).
Total Stroke
With reference to continuously employed subjects, the mul-
tivariable HR (95% CI) for total stroke incidence was 1.58

 1178  Stroke  May 2017
(1.18–2.13) in men and 1.51 (1.08–2.29) in women who lost 
their jobs, and that for mortality was 2.22 (1.34–3.68) in men 
and 2.48 (1.26–4.77) in women. In reemployed men, the multi-
variable HR (95% CI) was 2.96 (1.89–4.62) for stroke incidence 
and 4.21 (1.97–8.97) for mortality, whereas in women was 1.30 
(0.98–1.69) for incidence and 1.28 (0.76–2.17) for mortality. 
In continuously unemployed men, the multivariable HR (95% 
CI) was 1.36 (0.73–2.55) for incidence and 5.24 (2.66–10.31) 
for mortality, whereas in women was 1.58 (0.99–2.49) for inci-
dence and 5.35 (2.44–7.76) for mortality. (Table 2, model 2) The 
multivariable HR (95% CI) in men who experienced at least 1 
spell of unemployment was 1.76 (1.39–2.23) for incidence and 
3.00 (2.06–4.37) for mortality, whereas in women was 1.38 
(1.11–1.72) for incidence and 1.98 (1.35–2.88) for mortality. 
(Table 3, model 2). The associations remained unchanged after 
further adjustment for possible mediating factors (model 3), 
after excluding early incident and mortality cases (Table I in the 
online-only Data Supplement), after adjusting for educational 
level as an indicator for the socioeconomic status (Table II in 
the online-only Data Supplement), and after running a propen-
sity score weighting for having an unemployment experience 
(Table III in the online-only Data Supplement).
Stroke Types
Having an experience of unemployment was associated with 
risk of hemorrhagic stroke; the multivariable HR (95% CI) 
in men was 1.77 (1.21–2.59) for incidence and 2.28 (1.32–
3.94) for mortality, whereas in women was 1.28 (1.06–1.63) 
for incidence and 1.91 (1.22–2.99) for mortality. The multi-
variable HR (95% CI) of ischemic stroke in men was 1.75 
(1.30–2.37) for incidence and 3.45 (1.57–7.58) for mortality, 
whereas in women was 1.33 (1.07–1.83) for incidence and 
1.61 (1.02–8.80) for mortality (Table 3, model 2).
Discussion
In this cohort of middle-aged Japanese men and women, 
experiencing at least 1 spell of unemployment was associ-
ated with increased risks of stroke morbidity and mortality.

 Eshak et al  Changes in the Employment Status and Risk of Stroke   1179
Compared with continuously employed subjects; job lost men 
and women had increased risks of developing and dying from 
both hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes. Reemployed men, but 
not women, also had increased risks of stroke. Continuously 
unemployed men and women showed higher risks of stroke 
mortality. Our findings were generally consistent with find-
ings from previous studies4–6,9–11; however, only a Korean study 
investigated sex-specific association between unemployment 
with risk of stroke mortality and described an increased risk 
among men but not women.10
The postulated mechanisms by which unemployment 
associates with increased risk of stroke can be explained by 
the causation and the selection hypotheses.12 Mechanisms 
in the causation hypothesis include depression,3 financial 
strain,24 stress, social stigma leading to social isolation, 
and the loss of psychosocial assets such as marital status 
and work relationships.25 This may also trigger subsequent

destructive coping strategies such as increased tobacco and 
alcohol use.26 Job lost men in our study showed unhealthy 
profiles of behavior and psychological state than continu-
ously employed men.
On the other hand, the selection hypothesis is encountered 
when jobless or reemployed subjects had lost their previous 
jobs because of a preexisting ill-health. It is possible that a 
prestroke, presurvey poor health predicted both unemploy-
ment and stroke. High proportions of job lost subjects in our 
study were hypertensive or diabetics; however, these risk fac-
tors are mostly asymptomatic and do not act as barriers to 
work.27 Thus, the causative effect may have a greater influence

 Eshak et al  Changes in the Employment Status and Risk of Stroke   1181
than the selection effect, although they both interact in a mutu-
ally reinforcing way to impact health.14
Although, it was seen in previous Western studies that reem-
ployment provided favorable conditions for health, such as 
reduced psychological distress,15,18 a reduction in unhealthy 
reactive behaviors such as heavy drinking,28 and alleviation of 
financial strain. However, we observed a greater increased risk 
in the reemployed men than that found in the job lost men. In our 
study, the risk of incident total stroke was significantly higher in 
reemployed men when the job loss group was used as a refer-
ence; HR (95% CI) was 1.82 (1.07–3.08; not shown in table). No 
such an increased risk was seen in reemployed women.
At least 4 explanations can be proposed to explain the 
increased risk in the reemployed men. First, reemployment 
may carry a double burden, one because of the previous job 
loss and the other because of strain to keep the newly attained 
job. Reemployed men are more likely to have greater job inse-
curity.29 Men who experience 1 spell of unemployment are at 
high risk of experiencing another.13,30 Where unemployment 
was associated with poor psychological health, this job inse-
curity for reemployed was more strongly associated with poor 
physical health.31 Reemployed men might put pressure on 
themselves to keep their job, such as being reluctant to take a 
sick day off32,33 or to visit a doctor because of limited access 
to health insurance.34 Second, the life-term employment sys-
tem in Japan enforces male employees to devote themselves 
to a stable job, once entered the labor market. Contrary, when 
they lose the job, they are more likely to be reemployed in 
lower positions, which imply having poorer financial con-
ditions35 and lower work-related benefits.29 After subjects’ 
right to unemployment benefit ran out, the rate of reemploy-
ment (especially in part-time jobs) increased significantly 
in Japanese subjects who had lost their jobs.18 Interestingly, 
among 20 254 continuously employed men who have reported 
whether they changed their job or not in this study, the mul-
tivariable HR (95% CI) for incident stroke in those who 
changed their job (n=1743) referenced to those kept the same 
job (n=18 511) was 1.30 (1.06–1.60). Third, the changes in the 
employment status in our study had occurred (between 1990 
and 2000), a period known as the lost-decade, in which Japan 
experienced economic recession after the economic crash of 
1990. The association between job loss and health tended to 
weaken in periods of recession as the general unemployment 
rate increased, suggesting that keeping a newly attained job 
during recession, than during less uncertain times, may infer 
much stress and might be more harmful to health than los-
ing a job.13 Finally, the selection bias might be encountered in 
reemployed men; reemployed men might have lost their pre-
vious jobs because of previous illness. Poor health does not 
necessarily act as a barrier to the return to work27; thus, with 
the proposed stress, those unhealthy individuals returned to 
work were at greater risk of stroke morbidity and mortality. 
However, reemployed men in this study did not show higher 
prevalence of preexisting comorbidities than continuously 
employed men.
For reemployed women, it is plausible not seeing an 
increased risk as that in men because the pattern of Japanese 
women’s participation in the labor force by age group is 
represented by an M shape, reflecting their tendency to have 
a career break during their 30s, in response to their family 
responsibilities, and then return to the labor force in their 
40s,36,37 which is different from men in whom the propor-
tion of working age men without job is relatively low in 
Japan.37 Findings among women should be interpreted care-
fully because while 10% of women reported to be housewives 
and 3.5% reported to have no job in our baseline data; these 
2 categories were probably mixed because our prebaseline 
data could not identify housewives from unemployed women. 
Thus, reemployed women are likely to restart their career 
after their career break, whereas reemployed men are likely 
to regain other jobs after their job loss. The meaning of reem-
ployment could differ between men and women, which could 
generate sex differences in stroke risk.
The length of unemployment has been associated with 
stroke mortality7,12–14; the increased risk of stroke mortality in 
continuously unemployed subjects of this study was greater 
than that for incident stroke. Although we adjusted for history 
of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, other chronic morbidi-
ties or disabilities in the continuously unemployed subjects, 
such as renal or hepatic diseases, might have obliged them 
to stay jobless and might have put them at a higher risk of 
mortality.
This study is the first prospective study to provide evidence 
on the long-term effect of reemployment on risk of morbid-
ity and mortality from stroke and stroke types and the first 
to use the propensity score for the probability of experienc-
ing unemployment. However, the present analysis has several 
limitations. First, our variable of employment status could 
not differentiate between voluntary and involuntary job loss, 
including retirement. Findings from several previous stud-
ies showed that both voluntary and involuntary job loss were 
associated with a higher risk of stroke.4–6 However, to reduce 
this problem, we limited our population by age <60 years as 
early retirement is unusual in Japan. Also, we did not update 
the changes in the employment status using data collected 5 
years after our baseline because any changes in the employ-
ment status after our baseline will be contaminated by the 
effect of losing a job because of retirement (31% of the stud-
ied participants). Second, the few cases of stroke events in 
the categories of reemployed and continuously unemployed 
subjects hindered us from examining the association of los-
ing or gaining a job as separate exposure variables with risk 
of stroke types. Third, although the response rate to the pre-
baseline survey (81.6%) should be considered satisfactory, we 
do not know whom exactly the nonrespondents represented. 
What we found was that, 5% of the nonrespondents to our 
baseline survey (compared with 1.5% of the respondents) 
were unemployed at the time of the prebaseline survey. Last, 
our questionnaire did not give an indication of the employ-
ment status in the intervening 5 years between the prebaseline 
and the baseline surveys. To gain a complete picture of the 
effect of reemployment on health, it is necessary to follow the 
same people over consecutive employment transitions.

Summary
Middle-aged Japanese men and women who have experienced 
at least 1 spell of unemployment showed unhealthy profiles of 
behavior and psychological state and had an increased risk of 
stroke (both hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes) morbidity and 
mortality. Moreover, men, but not women, who have lost their 
jobs and then returned to the labor market were at a greater 
risk of stroke which may be attributed to greater job insecurity. 
Avoidance of unemployment and maintenance of job security 
during the productive ages could help reduce the stroke risk.
