ABSTRACT
Background: The association between saturated fatty acid (SFA)
intake and ischemic heart disease (IHD) risk is debated.
Objective: We sought to investigate whether dietary SFAs were
associated with IHD risk and whether associations depended on
1) the substituting macronutrient, 2) the carbon chain length of
SFAs, and 3) the SFA food source.
Design: Baseline (1993–1997) SFA intake was measured with a food-
frequency questionnaire among 35,597 participants from the European
Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition–Netherlands cohort.
IHD risks were estimated with multivariable Cox regression for the
substitution of SFAs with other macronutrients and for higher intakes
of total SFAs, individual SFAs, and SFAs from different food sources.
Results: During 12 y of follow-up, 1807 IHD events occurred. Total
SFA intake was associated with a lower IHD risk (HR per 5% of
energy: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.74, 0.93). Substituting SFAs with animal
protein, cis monounsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids
(PUFAs), or carbohydrates was significantly associated with higher
IHD risks (HR per 5% of energy: 1.27–1.37). Slightly lower IHD
risks were observed for higher intakes of the sum of butyric (4:0)
through capric (10:0) acid (HRSD: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.89, 0.99), myristic
acid (14:0) (HRSD: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.83, 0.97), the sum of pentadecylic
(15:0) and margaric (17:0) acid (HRSD: 0.91: 95% CI: 0.83, 0.99),
and for SFAs from dairy sources, including butter (HRSD: 0.94; 95%
CI: 0.90, 0.99), cheese (HRSD: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.86, 0.97), and milk
and milk products (HRSD: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.86, 0.97).
Conclusions: In this Dutch population, higher SFA intake was not
associated with higher IHD risks. The lower IHD risk observed did not
depend on the substituting macronutrient but appeared to be driven mainly
by the sums of butyric through capric acid, the sum of pentadecylic and
margaric acid, myristic acid, and SFAs from dairy sources. Residual
confounding by cholesterol-lowering therapy and trans fat or limited
variation in SFA and PUFA intake may explain our findings. Analyses
need to be repeated in populations with larger differences in SFA intake
and different SFA food sources.

INTRODUCTION
Limiting the intake of dietary SFAs is an important component
of recommendations for the prevention of ischemic heart disease
(IHD).7 High SFA intake is associated with higher blood LDL-
cholesterol levels (1), an established risk factor for IHD (2).
However, the association between SFAs and IHD is now heavily
debated (3–5), in part because evidence on this link appears to
originate mainly from results of early ecologic studies (6),
secondary prevention studies, and short-term biomarker studies
(7–9), whereas a direct link between SFAs and IHD in pro-
spective cohort studies is lacking. A meta-analysis that included
16 cohort studies showed no association between SFA intake
and IHD risk, with an RR of 1.07 (95% CI: 0.96, 1.19) in the
highest compared with the lowest quintile of intake (10). An
update of this meta-analysis, including 4 additional prospective
cohort studies (11) as well as a meta-analysis of a selection of 12
cohort studies (12), observed similar null associations with RRs
of 1.03 (95% CI: 0.98, 1.07) (11) and 1.06 (95% CI: 0.95, 1.17)

 (12). However, the association between SFAs and IHD may
depend on several factors that were not taken into account in all
3 meta-analyses.
First, the association may depend on the macronutrients that
replace SFAs in the diet. A pooled analysis of 11 cohort studies
showed that the association between SFAs and IHD differed when
SFAs were replaced by PUFAs as opposed to carbohydrates or
MUFAs (13).
Second, specific types of SFAs that differ in carbon chain
length may also differ in their effects on blood lipids and thereby
on IHD risk. SFAs consist predominantly of the long-chain fatty
acids stearic acid (18:0), palmitic acid (16:0), myristic acid
(14:0), and lauric acid (12:0). A meta-analysis of 60 controlled
trials showed that compared with carbohydrates these different
types of SFAs vary in their effect on blood lipid levels (1). The
NHS (Nurses’ Health Study) is the only prospective cohort study
to our knowledge that has specifically addressed the relation be-
tween dietary SFAs differing in carbon chain length and IHD (14).
This cohort study observed a moderately increased IHD risk for
the sum of longer-chain SFAs (lauric acid through stearic acid),
whereas for short- to medium-chain SFAs [butyric (4:0) through
capric (10:0) acid] no associations with IHD were observed.
Finally, different food sources of SFAs may modulate the effect
of SFAs on IHD risk. The major food sources of SFAs are of animal
origin, including meat and dairy products. In addition to the dif-
ference in specific SFAs in these products, other nutrients in these
foods (and the way they interact with SFAs) could affect the risk of
IHD. Accordingly, in the MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Athero-
sclerosis) cohort, each 5-g/d intake of dairy SFAs was associated
with a 16% lower risk of IHD, whereas each 5-g/d intake of meat
SFAs was related to a 29% higher risk of IHD (15).
In this study we examined the association between SFA intake
and incident IHD risk and whether associations differed based on 1)
the type of macronutrient that replaces SFAs, 2) the type of SFA
(differing in carbon chain length), and 3) the food source of SFAs.
METHODS
Study population
The EPIC-NL (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer
and Nutrition–Netherlands) cohort consists of the Prospect-
EPIC and MORGEN (Monitoring Project on Risk Factors
for Chronic Diseases) cohorts. Both cohorts were set up
simultaneously between 1993 and 1997 and recruited a total
of 40,011 participants. The design and rationale of EPIC-NL are
described in detail elsewhere (16). In brief, the Prospect-EPIC
study included 17,357 women aged 49–70 y who lived in or near
Utrecht and who participated in a nationwide breast cancer
screening program. The MORGEN cohort consisted of 22,654
men and women aged 20–65 y selected from random samples of
the Dutch population in 3 Dutch towns (Doetinchem, Am-
sterdam, and Maastricht). All participants signed informed
consent before inclusion. Both studies complied with the Dec-
laration of Helsinki. Prospect-EPIC was approved by the in-
stitutional review board of the University Medical Center
Utrecht, and MORGEN was approved by the medical ethics
committee of the Netherlands Organization for Applied Sci-
entific Research (TNO). At baseline, a general and a food-
frequency questionnaire (FFQ) were administered, and a physical
examination was performed that included blood pressure mea-
surements, anthropometric data, and blood sampling (16).
For this study we excluded subjects who withheld permission
for linkage with vital status and death registries (n = 2717);
subjects with missing questionnaires (n = 172); subjects with an
implausible energy intake based on the ratio of reported energy
intake to estimated basal metabolic rate, i.e., the top or bottom
0.5% of the ratio (n = 342); and prevalent cases of cardiovas-
cular disease at baseline (n = 1183), leaving a total of 35,597
subjects for analysis.
Intake of foods, saturated fat, and other nutrients
Food intake was assessed by a self-administered FFQ that
measured the mean consumption frequency of 79 main food
categories during the year before study enrollment (17). This FFQ
allowed for the estimation of the habitual intake of 178 food
items. Portion sizes were estimated with use of photographs of
several food items. Based on frequencies and portion sizes, the
mean daily intake (g/d) was calculated for each subject in-
dividually. The intakes of all macronutrients and micronutrients
were then calculated based on an updated version of the com-
puterized Dutch food composition table 1996 (18). Intakes of
SFAs differing in chain length were calculated based on the
Dutch food composition table 1998 (digital update; available on
request from the National Institute for Public Health and the
Environment). Before the start of the study, the FFQ was vali-
dated against twelve 24-h recalls among 121 men and women
(19). Pearson correlation coefficients showed good relative validity
for intakes of fat (men: 0.63; women: 0.61), carbohydrates (men:
0.76; women: 0.74), and protein (men: 0.76; women: 0.71) (19).
Spearman rank correlation coefficients showed reasonable to good
validity for intakes of total SFAs and the individual SFAs included in
this study (butyric acid through stearic acid), ranging from 0.47 to
0.71 in men and from 0.30 to 0.66 in women (J Praagman et al.,
unpublished results, 2015). Furthermore, the FFQ showed good
reproducibility for the measurement of both total and individual
SFAs, with intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0.58 to
0.73 in men and from 0.66 to 0.83 in women.
Because of very low intakes of butyric, caproic (6:0), caprylic
(8:0), and capric acids, these SFAs were summed and evaluated as
short- to medium-chain SFAs in this study. For the same reason,
intakes of pentadecylic (15:0) and margaric (17:0) acids were
summed and evaluated as such. Based on the food groups that are
predefined in the Dutch food composition table 1996 (18), we
identified the following 7 mutually exclusive food groups that
together contributed w82% of the mean total SFA intake in the
study population: cheese, meat, milk and milk products, fats,
butter, cakes, and snacks. We separated the fats group into 2
subgroups based on SFA content: hard and solid fats (including
margarines and fats in wrappers and solid frying fats, all of
which contained $20 g SFAs/100 g of product) and soft and
liquid fats (including soft margarines, vegetable oils, liquid fats,
and frying oils, all of which contained ,20 g SFAs/100 g of
product). The remaining food groups, which each contributed
,2.5% to the total SFA intake, were aggregated and labeled as
other sources. Total SFAs was defined as the sum of individual
fatty acids with only single bonds between the carbon atoms in
the fatty acid chain. SFA intake from each food group was
calculated by summing the amount of total SFAs present in all

 foods included in that group. Total carbohydrates comprised all
types of carbohydrates except dietary fiber. cis MUFAs included
fatty acids with one double carbon bond with a cis configuration
(Supplemental Figure 1). Total PUFAs included fatty acids
with multiple double bonds and with cis and/or trans configu-
rations (Supplemental Figure 2). trans Fat was the sum of all
trans MUFAs and trans PUFAs. Protein intake was divided in
animal- and vegetable-derived protein based on whether the
food source was of animal or vegetable origin.
Alcohol consumption was categorized as follows: 0, 0.1–6.0,
6.1–12.0, 12.1–24.0, and .24 g/d for women and 0, 0.1–6.0, 6.1–
12.0, 12.1–24.0, 24.1–60.0, and .60 g/d for men. The international
table compiled by Foster-Powell et al. (20) was used to obtain the
glycemic index (GI) of foods. Intake variables of total SFAs, SFAs
differing in carbon chain lengths, SFAs from specific food groups,
and other macronutrient intake variables were expressed as per-
centages of total energy intake. Other nutrients were adjusted for
total energy intake through use of the residual method (21).
Other baseline assessments
Informationondemographic characteristics,the presence ofchronic
diseases, and cardiovascular disease risk factors was obtained with
the general questionnaire at baseline. Smoking status was cate-
gorized as never, former, or current. Education was defined in 3
categories: low (primary education up to completing intermediate
vocational education), intermediate (up to higher secondary ed-
ucation), or high (higher vocational education and university). On
the basis of information about the duration and types of physical
activity, which were assessed through a validated questionnaire,
the Cambridge physical activity index was calculated (22), and
participants were divided into 4 categories for physical activity
level (inactive, moderately inactive, moderately active, and active).
During the physical examination at baseline body weight, height
and waist circumference were measured. BMI was calculated as
weight divided by height squared (kg/m2). Mean systolic and
diastolic blood pressure were obtained by calculating the mean of
2 sequential measurements that were performed in the supine
position with a cuff on the left arm through use of either a boso
oscillomat (Bosch & Son) (Prospect-EPIC) or a random-zero
sphygmomanometer (MORGEN). Hypertension was considered
present when at least one of the following criteria were met:
systolic blood pressure .140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure
.90 mm Hg, self-reported use of antihypertensive medication, or
self-reported physician-diagnosed hypertension. Total cholesterol
concentrations were measured with use of enzymatic methods,
and HDL and LDL cholesterol were measured with use of
a standard homogeneous assay with an enzymatic endpoint.
Ascertainment of IHD
Morbidity data were obtained from the Dutch Center for Health
Care Information, which holds a standardized computerized reg-
istry of hospital discharge diagnoses. Admission files from general
and university hospitals in the Netherlands have been stored
continuously since 1990. The records contain data on sex, date of
birth, dates of admission and discharge, at least 1 principal di-
agnosis, and up to 9 optional additional diagnoses. All events were
coded by qualified medical administrative personnel in the hos-
pitals according to the International Classification of Diseases,
Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification. The National Medical
Registry checked the data and collected them in the hospital
discharge diagnosis database, which is linked to the cohort based
on information of birthdate, sex, postal code, and general prac-
titioner with a validated probabilistic method (23). Information on
vital status was obtained through digital linkage with municipal
registries, and causes of death were obtained through linkage with
Statistics Netherlands. We identified all first-ever IHD events
(International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical
Modification: 410–414, 427.5, 798.1, 798.2, and 798.9). Follow-
up was complete until 1 January 2008.
Data analysis
Baseline characteristics of the study population were calculated
across quintiles of total SFA intake in percentage of energy and
presented as means with SDs for normally distributed variables,
medians with IQRs for variables that were not normally distrib-
uted, or percentages for categorical variables. Pearson correlations
between intakes of total SFAs, SFAs from food sources, and SFAs
differing in carbon chain length were calculated.
Person-years were calculated as the time between the date of
the study entry and the date of the first-ever IHD event, date of
death, loss to follow-up, or end of follow-up (1 January 2008),
whichever came first.
We used Cox proportional hazard regression models to calculate
HRs with 95% CIs for the association between SFA intake and risk
of IHD incidence (fatal and nonfatal). Total SFA intake was
evaluated per 5% of energy and entered as a continuous variable
into the Cox regression models. In addition to a crude model (model
1), 3 models were constructed to adjust for potential confounding.
As potential confounders, we considered known risk factors for
IHD and covariables that were associated with SFA intake and IHD
risk in our population. Model 2 was adjusted for age. Model 3 was
additionally adjusted for sex, total energy intake, BMI, waist cir-
cumference, educational level, physical activity index, smoking
status, and alcohol intake (in categories). Model 4 was additionally
adjusted for intakes of trans fat, animal protein, and vegetable
protein (all in percentage of energy) and for energy-adjusted in-
takes of vitamin C, fiber, and dietary cholesterol. The HRs for SFA
intakes after adjustment for models 1, 2, and 3 can be interpreted
as the IHD risk for an increased intake of energy from total SFAs
(or SFA type) at the expense of intakes of energy from all other
types of fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. Because of additional
adjustment for trans fat, animal protein, and vegetable protein
(and the sum of other SFAs), the HRs after adjustment for model 4
can be interpreted as the IHD risk for an increased intake of en-
ergy from total SFAs (or SFA type) at the expense of intakes of
energy from PUFAs, cis MUFAs, and carbohydrates.
To estimate the risk of IHD when energy intake from SFAs was
substituted by an equal amount of energy from each of the other
macronutrients, all 4 Cox models were converted into substitution
models. These models included intakes of PUFAs, cis MUFAs,
trans fat, total carbohydrates, animal protein, and vegetable pro-
tein (all expressed per 5% of energy), as well as total energy
intake from all macronutrients except energy from alcohol con-
sumption. By excluding SFA intake from the models, the HR for
each macronutrient can be interpreted as the difference in IHD risk
for each additional intake of 5% of energy from that particular
macronutrient at the expense of 5% of energy from SFAs (21). To

 distinguish between the quality of carbohydrates, subjects were
ranked based on their GI intake. The analyses in which SFAs were
substituted with total carbohydrates were then stratified for tertiles
of this GI distribution (24). In this way, the substitution of SFAs
with carbohydrates in GI tertiles 1, 2, and 3 represented the
substitution of SFAs with carbohydrates in subjects with a low-,
medium-, and high-GI diet, respectively. Intakes of SFAs differing
in carbon chain length or SFAs from different food sources were
separately evaluated by entering them into the Cox models as
continuous variables per 1 SD of intake. The SDs for the sum of
butyric through capric acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid,
the sum of pentadecylic and margaric acid, and stearic acid were
0.27%, 0.24%, 0.44%, 1.19%, 0.11%, and 0.66% of energy, re-
spectively. The SDs for SFAs from butter, cheese, milk and milk
products, meat, cakes, snacks, hard and solid fats, soft and liquid
fats, and other sources were 1.42%, 1.95%, 1.45%, 1.44%, 0.83%,
0.40%. 1.25%, 0.50%, and 1.06% of energy, respectively. The 4
previously mentioned Cox models were used, with additional ad-
justment in model 4 for the sum of all other consumed SFAs. To
identify whether nonlinear associations existed, quadratic terms
of the SFA intake variables were included in the fourth model.
P values for quadratic terms were between 0.1 and 0.9 for all SFA
intake variables except for SFAs from milk. However, the con-
struction of restricted cubic splines showed no significant nonlinear
association between SFAs from milk and IHD (P = 0.06) (Sup-
plemental Figure 3). The proportional hazards assumption was
tested by calculating Schoenfeld residuals and visual inspection of
log-log plots, which showed no significant deviations. We per-
formed a series of sensitivity analyses and checked for possible
effect modification by sex by adding a product term of sex with
SFAs to the final models. To check whether blood cholesterol or
blood pressure were possible intermediates, we adjusted the fourth
model for the baseline total cholesterol:HDL cholesterol ratio or
systolic blood pressure. To minimize the possibility of reverse
causation, we repeated the analyses in the population after ex-
cluding the first 2 y of follow-up. Because baseline dietary data
could be unrelated to events occurring after a very long follow-up
time, we repeated our analyses for the first 5 y of follow-up only by
censoring everyone in the study population who in the first 5 y did
not experience an event and was not lost to follow-up. Furthermore,
we performed separate analyses for nonfatal IHD events (n = 1649)
only because previously published studies have suggested that as-
sociations may differ for IHD mortality compared with nonfatal
IHD (13). Because of the low number of IHD deaths in our pop-
ulation (n = 158), we did not perform a separate analysis for IHD
mortality only. We repeated the analyses with age as the underlying
time axis and additional stratification by birth year in 5-y intervals
to adjust for calendar effects (25). Finally, we checked whether
differences in associations were observed between the substitution
of SFAs with n–3 PUFAs compared with n–6 PUFA, as suggested
previously (26). All statistical analyses were executed in SAS 9.2
(SAS Institute), and P values ,0.05 (2-sided) were considered
statistically significant.
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics
The baseline characteristics of the total study population are
presented in Table 1. Compared with subjects with the lowest
intake, subjects with a high intake of SFAs were more likely to
be older women who smoked and who had a higher BMI and
waist circumference, higher blood pressure, higher total cho-
lesterol:HDL cholesterol ratio, and less education and physical
activity. Subjects with high SFA intake also reported higher
intakes of cis MUFAs, trans fat, cholesterol, animal protein, and
calcium and lower intakes of carbohydrates, vegetable protein,
fiber, vitamin C, and alcohol.
The mean baseline intake of total SFAs in the population was
15.0% 6 2.7% of energy. More than 97% of the population
exceeded the upper intake limit of 10% of energy/d as rec-
ommended by the Health Council of the Netherlands (27).
Most SFA intake was represented by the long-chain SFAs
palmitic acid (51.2%) and stearic acid (25.5%) (Figure 1). The
main food sources of SFAs were cheese (17.4%), milk and
milk products (16.6%), meat (17.5%), hard and solid fats
(8.6%), and butter (7.3%) (Figure 2). Pearson correlation
coefficients of intakes of all individual SFAs ranged between
0.30 and 0.63, except for palmitic and stearic acids, which
were highly correlated (r = 0.92) because of shared food
sources (Table 2). The main food sources of palmitic acid and
stearic acid were meat and cheese. Milk and milk products and
cheese were the top 2 contributors of the sum of butyric
through capric acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, and the sum of
pentadecylic and margaric acids (Supplemental Figure 4).
The percentages of cis MUFAs and PUFAs provided by the
predefined SFA food groups can be found in Supplemental
Figures 5 and 6.
Total SFA intake and IHD risk
Over a median follow-up time of 12.2 y, 1807 incident
IHD cases were documented; 158 (8.7%) of these were fatal.
After multivariable adjustment for lifestyle and dietary factors
(model 4), a higher intake of energy from SFAs was significantly
associated with a 17% lower IHD risk (HR per 5% of energy:
0.83; 95% CI: 0.74, 0.93) (Table 3). Table 4 presents the HRs for
the association between a higher intake of energy from carbo-
hydrates, cis MUFAs, PUFAs, or protein at the expense of an
equal amount of energy from SFAs and incident IHD. After full
adjustment (model 4), the substitution of SFAs with total car-
bohydrates (HR5en%: 1.23; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.40), cis MUFAs
(HR5en%: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.65), PUFAs (HR5en%: 1.35; 95%
CI: 1.14, 1.61), or animal protein (HR5en%: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.14,
1.65) was significantly associated with higher IHD risks. We
observed differences in IHD risk when SFAs were substituted
with carbohydrates differing in GI values. The higher IHD
risk for substitution of SFAs with high-GI carbohydrates was
statistically significant (HRGI .56: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.56),
whereas the IHD risk for substitution with low-GI carbohy-
drates was not statistically significant (HRGI ,53: 1.14; 95%
CI: 0.91, 1.43). No significant association with IHD risk was
observed for the substitution of SFAs with vegetable protein
(HR5en%: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.57, 1.17).

 adjustment for lifestyle and dietary factors (model 4), slightly but
significantly lower IHD risks were observed for each additional
SD of intake of energy from short- to medium-chain SFAs (HR:
0.93; 95% CI: 0.89, 0.99), myristic acid (HR: 0.90; 95% CI 0.83,
0.97), and the sum of pentadecylic and margaric acids (HR: 0.91;
95% CI: 0.83, 0.99). No significant associations were observed for
intakes of lauric (HR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.91, 1.02), palmitic (HR: 1.00;
95% CI: 0.91, 1.10), or stearic (HR: 1.05; 95% CI: 0.97, 1.14) acid.
Intake of SFAs from food sources and risk of IHD
After adjustment for lifestyle and dietary factors (model 4),
slightly but significantly lower IHD risks were found for each
additional SD of intake of SFAs from butter (HR: 0.94; 95%
CI: 0.90, 0.99), SFAs from cheese (HR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.86, 0.97),
and SFAs from milk (HR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.86, 0.97) (Table 5). No
significant associations were observed for intakes of SFAs from
other food sources.

 Sensitivity analyses
We observed no significant effect modification by sex (P values
all between 0.2 and 0.9), except for SFAs from cheese (P = 0.03).
Stratification for sex in the model for SFAs from cheese showed
that the lowered risk was stronger in women (HR: 0.89; 95%
CI: 0.83, 0.96) than in men (HR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.88, 1.07).
Our results did not materially change after including the baseline
total cholesterol:HDL cholesterol ratio or systolic blood pressure
in the models (Supplemental Tables 1 and 2), excluding the first
2 y of follow-up (Supplemental Table 3), analyzing the first 5 y
of follow-up only (Supplemental Table 4), or analyzing nonfatal
IHD events only (data not shown). The results for the analysis
with age as the underlying time axis did not differ from the
analysis with follow-up time as the time axis (e.g., HR per 5%
energy of total SFA intake: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.74, 0.93). In addition,
distinguishing between n–3 PUFAs (mean intake: 1.2 6 0.5 g/d)
and n–6 PUFAs (mean intake: 10.7 6 4.9 g/d) as a replacement
for SFAs did not yield different results (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
In this prospective cohort study in 35,597 Dutch men and
women, a higher intake of total SFAs was associated with a lower
risk of incident IHD. This association did not depend on the
substituting macronutrient but rather on the chain length and food
source of SFAs, with slightly lower IHD risks for higher intakes
of the sum of butyric through capric acid, myristic acid, the sum
of pentadecylic and margaric acids, and SFAs from dairy sources
(milk and milk products, cheese, and butter).
Strengths of this study include the prospective study de-
sign, long follow-up period, large number of IHD events, and
robustness of findings in sensitivity analyses. Although we adjusted
for a wide range of potential confounders, we cannot exclude that
residual confounding partly explains our findings. For instance,
our study lacks information on the initiation of cholesterol-
lowering therapy during follow-up. It is conceivable that in-
dividuals with high SFA intake have high cholesterol (1) and will
become eligible for cholesterol-lowering therapy during follow-
up. In w15% of the EPIC-NL cohort that is examined every 5 y,
it was indeed observed that cholesterol-lowering therapy in-
creased from ,2% at baseline to .10% at 10 y of follow-up
(28). Cholesterol-lowering therapy is a confounder and would
reduce IHD risk substantially (29), which may at least partially
explain the observed reduced IHD risk associated with SFA
intake. Another limitation is that SFA intake was measured with
use of an FFQ, a tool that relies on self-reporting. However,
a validation study showed reasonable to good reproducibility
and relative validity for SFA intake (J Praagman et al., un-
published results, 2015).
Three meta-analyses, including the study results of a total of 22
observational cohorts, observed no association between SFA
intake and IHD incidence (10–12). We also did not observe an
increased IHD risk with higher total SFA intake in this cohort
study but found instead a reduced risk. Although this differs
from the meta-analyses, it has been reported previously. In the
MESA cohort, an even lower IHD risk was observed (HR per
5% of energy: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.96) (15). Neither the MESA
cohort study nor the meta-analyses (10–12) considered the
macronutrients that substituted SFAs, which may affect the as-
sociation between SFAs and IHD (30). Our results for the sub-
stitution of SFAs with cis MUFAs (13), total carbohydrates (13),
and carbohydrates differing in GI (24) are essentially in line
with most previous cohort studies (13, 24), although a recent

 updated analysis in the NHS and Health Professionals Follow-
Up Study showed lower IHD risks for the replacement of SFAs
with MUFAs and with carbohydrates from whole grains (31). A
meta-analysis of trials showed no significant association be-
tween replacing SFAs with MUFAs, carbohydrates, or protein
and IHD events; however, these results were based on a limited
number of studies and events with high heterogeneity (32).To
our knowledge, no previous cohort studies have investigated the
association between the substitution of SFAs with animal pro-
tein and IHD risk. The inverse association between the sub-
stitution of SFA with PUFAs and IHD risk in our study conflicts
with a consistent body of evidence from previous trials that
investigated the effects on blood lipids (1) or IHD outcomes (32,
33), as well as evidence from cohort studies (13, 31, 34). All
these previous studies showed inverse associations between the
substitution of SFAs with PUFAs and IHD risk, but one study
did not show these associations (35). We are not certain what
causes the discrepancy between our results and those from the
other studies. Perhaps our analyses were limited by the small
SFA intake range (IQR: 13.2–16.6% of energy) at a high mean

 intake level (15.0% of energy). In populations with SFA intakes
covering a wider range, the association may be different from
our study. To illustrate this point, the range of SFA intake in the
pooled cohort study (13) was wider (with 80% central ranges
between 6% and 26.9% of energy). Furthermore, because the
range of PUFA intake was small (IQR: 5.6–7.9% of energy), this
may have limited the possibility to model the substitution of
these 2 macronutrients. Another explanation for our findings
may be that certain PUFA food sources consumed in our study
population also contained trans fat at that time. For instance, the
most important PUFA source, margarines (17%) (Supplemental
Figure 7), also provided 9% of the trans fat intake in our
population (Supplemental Figure 8). Residual confounding
caused by underestimating trans fat intakes may be present in
the observed associations between the substitution of SFAs with
PUFAs or MUFAs because of the gradual but drastic reduction
of the amount of trans fat in margarines and spread between
1994 and 1997 (36). Altogether, the lower IHD risk for higher
SFAs at the expense of PUFA intake needs to be interpreted with
caution.
When we distinguished between chain lengths of SFAs, we
observed differences in associations with IHD risk. In our study,
higher intakes of the short- to medium-chain SFAs (sum of
butyric through capric acid), myristic acid, and the sum of
pentadecylic and margaric acids, which are all mainly derived
from dairy sources, were associated with a slightly reduced IHD
risk. Intakes of lauric acid (which is largely derived not only from
dairy but also from coconut oil), however , as well as the long-
chain SFAs palmitic and stearic acids, were not associated with
IHD risk. In contrast to our findings, a meta-analysis of 60

 controlled trials showed that compared with carbohydrates the
serum LDL-raising effects of the even-chained SFAs with 12–18
carbons decreased with increasing chain length (1). To our
knowledge, the associations between SFAs differing in carbon
chain length and IHD risk were previously investigated only in
the NHS (14) that found no associations with short- to medium-
chain SFAs (butyric through capric acid) and moderately in-
creased IHD risk for long-chain SFAs (lauric through stearic
acids). This suggests that short- to medium-chain SFAs appear
to be more beneficial for cardiovascular disease risk than the
long-chain SFAs, which is in line with our findings.
The results we observed for SFAs differing in carbon chain
length and IHD risk correspond in part with our results for SFAs
from food sources. Our results suggest that the inverse association
between total SFAs and IHD was mainly driven by SFAs from
dairy sources. To our knowledge, the associations between SFAs
from food sources and IHD risk were previously investigated in
the MESA study (15) only. Our findings for SFAs from dairy are
in line with the results from MESA, which reported a 29% lower
IHD risk per 5% of energy (HR per 5% of energy: 0.71; 95%
CI: 0.52, 0.98). The null association between SFAs from other
sources and IHD in our study is also in line with the results from
MESA. On the other hand, MESA observed a nonsignificant
increased IHD risk for higher intake of SFAs from meat (HR per
5% of energy: 1.57; 95% CI: 0.98, 2.51) (15), whereas in our
study this association was essentially null. It is unclear whether
the association between SFAs from dairy and IHD in our study is
attributable to the type of SFA or to interactions of SFAs with
other components in dairy such as calcium, magnesium, or
potassium or whether it is caused by residual or unmeasured
confounding from specific nutrients in dairy.
Whether the risk differences observed in our study are at-
tributable to the SFA type or its food source or to unmeasured
confounding remains unclear for now and warrants investigation.
To conclude, in this Dutch population with a relatively high
SFA intake from dairy sources and modest range in SFA and
PUFA intake, we observed a lower IHD risk with a higher intake
of SFAs that did not depend on the type of substituting mac-
ronutrient. The association seems mainly driven by short- to
medium-chain SFAs, myristic acid, the sum of pentadecylic and
margaric acids, and SFAs from dairy sources including butter,
cheese, and milk and milk products. We cannot exclude con-
founding by unmeasured initiation of cholesterol-lowering
therapy during follow-up. The fact that we did not observe
a lower IHD risk for the substitution of SFAs with PUFAs may
have been caused by residual confounding by trans fat or by the
small range in PUFA intake in this cohort. Further investigation
is necessary in other populations with similar as well as different
dietary patterns before definitive conclusions can be drawn.
