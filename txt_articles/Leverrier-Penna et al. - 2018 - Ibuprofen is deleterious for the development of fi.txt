STUDY QUESTION: Does ibuprofen use during the first trimester of pregnancy interfere with the development of the human fetal ovary?
SUMMARY ANSWER: In human fetuses, ibuprofen exposure is deleterious for ovarian germ cells.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: In utero stages of ovarian development define the future reproductive capacity of a woman. In rodents,
analgesics can impair the development of the fetal ovary leading to early onset of fertility failure. Ibuprofen, which is available over-the-
counter, has been reported as a frequently consumed medication during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester when the ovarian
germ cells undergo crucial steps of proliferation and differentiation.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Organotypic cultures of human ovaries obtained from 7 to 12 developmental week (DW) fetuses
were exposed to ibuprofen at 1–100 μM for 2, 4 or 7 days. For each individual, a control culture (vehicle) was included and compared to its
treated counterpart. A total of 185 individual samples were included.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Ovarian explants were analyzed by flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry
and quantitative PCR. Endpoints focused on ovarian cell number, cell death, proliferation and germ cell complement. To analyze the possible
range of exposure, ibuprofen was measured in the umbilical cord blood from the women exposed or not to ibuprofen prior to termination of
pregnancy.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Human ovarian explants exposed to 10 and 100 μM ibuprofen showed reduced cell
number, less proliferating cells, increased apoptosis and a dramatic loss of germ cell number, regardless of the gestational age of the fetus.
Significant effects were observed after 7 days of exposure to 10 μM ibuprofen. At this concentration, apoptosis was observed as early as 2
days of treatment, along with a decrease in M2A-positive germ cell number. These deleterious effects of ibuprofen were not fully rescued
after 5 days of drug withdrawal.
LARGE SCALE DATA: N/A.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study was performed in an experimental setting of human ovaries explants exposed
to the drug in culture, which may not fully recapitulate the complexity of in vivo exposure and organ development. Inter-individual variability is
also to be taken into account.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Whereas ibuprofen is currently only contra-indicated after 24 weeks of pregnancy, our
results points to a deleterious effect of this drug on first trimester fetal ovaries ex vivo. These findings deserve to be considered in light of the

Introduction
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one of the most
commonly used over-the counter (OTC) medications for the treat-
ment of pain, inflammation and fever, with ibuprofen representing a
significant share of the market (Kristensen et al., 2016). In 2013, up to
28.3% of pregnant women reported the use of ibuprofen at some
stages during their pregnancy (Van Marter et al., 2013), ranking ibupro-
fen as the second most used OTC analgesic after paracetamol
(Thorpe et al., 2013). Although ibuprofen is clearly contra-indicated
from 24 weeks of gestation onwards because of well-known risks of
malformations, guidelines are more equivocal prior to 24 weeks.
Moreover, the consumption of ibuprofen during early pregnancy can
also occur due to unawareness of the pregnant state, or through ignor-
ing the composition of the self-medicated drugs that are being used.
During fetal life, the ovarian germ cell population goes through a ser-
ies of complex processes, initiating with germ cell specification and
migration into the gonad, followed by proliferation and entry into mei-
osis, and culminating in the formation of primordial follicles (Edson
et al., 2009). More specifically, during the first trimester of pregnancy,
ovarian dynamic developmental events are regulated by the germ cell
niche which govern the balance between germ cell proliferation, differ-
entiation and cell death (Kerr et al., 2013). Normal fetal development
of the ovary, i.e. the establishment of a dynamic—but finite—reserve
of follicles, defines the future reproductive capacity of the woman
(McGee and Hsueh, 2000). A poorly stocked initial reserve will result
in a shortened reproductive life span, early menopause or infertility
(Nelson et al., 2013), events that occur decades later.
Ibuprofen, like all NSAIDs, works by blocking cyclooxygenases
(COX), key enzymes involved in the first rate-limiting step in the con-
version of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins (PG) (Rainsford, 2009).
In the human fetal ovary, the constitutively expressed COX1 is primar-
ily found in somatic cells, whereas the inducible COX2 is restricted to
the periphery of the ovary where pluripotent germ cells are located,
inferring COX2 involvement in ovarian development (Bayne et al.,
2009). Despite evidence implicating PGs and COXs as critical factors
in adult female reproductive function (Duffy, 2015; Sugimoto et al.,
2015), little is known about their precise function in human ovarian
organogenesis. However, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) signaling was
related to enhanced expression of germ cell survival genes in human
fetal ovaries (Bayne et al., 2009), and analgesics were found to induce
cell death in human ovarian cancer cell lines (Andrews et al., 2008;
Zerbini et al., 2011; Duncan et al., 2012; Lima et al., 2015). Therefore,
we hypothesized that exposure of the developing ovary to COX inhi-
bitors may have toxic effects on germ and/or somatic cells.
The scientific community is raising increasing concerns about the
impact of environmental and pharmaceutical chemicals on the fetus
development. This includes pain medications which induce endocrine
disruption of the human fetal testis (Mazaud-Guittot et al., 2013;
Kristensen et al., 2016; Ben Maamar et al., 2017) and result in infertility
and premature ovarian insufficiency in mice and rats (Dean et al.,
2016; Holm et al., 2016; Johansson et al., 2016). To date, there is insuf-
ficient evidence concerning short-term effects of ibuprofen on fetal
organogenesis, and the prediction of long-term adverse effects of this
common medicine in adults. Therefore, the objective of the present
study was to assess the possible effects of ibuprofen on the human
fetal ovary, with a focus on cell viability, window of sensitivity, target
specificity and reversibility, during the key stages of female fetal germ
cell development along the first trimester. To this end, we used an ori-
ginal ex vivo model of human fetal ovary organotypic culture, which we
exposed to a range of ibuprofen concentrations for various durations.
Our results show that in the developing human ovary, germ cells are
particularly sensitive to ibuprofen damage.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
First trimester human fetuses (7–12 developmental weeks (DW), n = 185)
were obtained from legally induced terminations of pregnancy performed in
Rennes University Hospital from October 2013 to June 2017. No termination
of pregnancy was due to fetal abnormality. Tissues were collected following
women’s written consent, in accordance with the legal procedure agreed by
the National agency for biomedical research (authorization #PFS09-011;
Agence de la Biomédecine) and the approval of the Local ethics committee of
Rennes Hospital (advice # 11-48) approved the whole procedure.
Human fetal ovary collection
The termination of pregnancy was induced using a standard combined
Mifegyne® (mifepristone) and Cytotec® (misoprostol) protocol, followed
by aspiration. A subset of women received either 400 or 800 mg of ibupro-
fen for preventive analgesia or none. The potential effect of ibuprofen
intake prior termination was taken into account when analyzing the data.
Gestational age was determined by ultrasound, and further confirmed by
measurement of foot length. Blood was collected from umbilical cord from
fetuses older than 8 DW, samples were centrifuged and serum was stored
at −80°C. The ovaries were recovered from the aspiration products using
a binocular microscope (Olympus SZX7, Lille, France). They were imme-
diately placed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
Ex vivo culture
The recovered ovaries were cut into ~1 mm3 pieces and explants were
cultured in cell culture inserts (0.4 μM pores) placed in 24-well companion
plates (Becton-Dickinson, Le Pont de Claix, France). Ovaries from fetuses
younger than 10 DW were cultured in two separate wells, one ovary being
exposed to vehicle and the other one to ibuprofen. Ovaries from fetuses
older than 10 DW were either cultured in one well (for hormone mea-
surements) or four wells for multiple culture (i.e. one control and three
ibuprofen concentrations) conditions. Ovaries were halved lengthways
and each half was divided into 2–3 ovary pieces. Each well was filled with

 400 μl of phenol red-free Medium 199 (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Cergy
Pontoise, France) supplemented with 50 μg/ml gentamycin, 2.5 μg/ml fungi-
zone (Sigma Aldrich Chemicals, Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France) and insulin
(1 g/l), transferrin (0.55 g/l) and sodium selenite (0.67 mg/l) (Sigma Aldrich
Chemicals). Cultures were incubated at 37°C for up to 7 days under a
humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. The medium was replaced
with fresh media after the first 24 h and then every 48 h, immediately snap-
frozen on dry ice and stored at −80°C. Explants were immediately exposed
to treatments by adding to the medium either vehicle at a final concentration
of 0.1% v/v (dimethyl sulfoxide; DMSO) or ibuprofen (Sigma Aldrich
Chemicals). Since therapeutic concentrations of ibuprofen in the plasma
range from 10 to 200 μM (Kallstrom et al., 1988; Karttunen et al., 1990),
concentrations of analgesics used in the current study were 10 μM to test
common treatment effect, and 1–100 μM to assess potential dose–response
effects.
Single cell dissociation and flow cytometry
Explants were submitted to a sequential enzymatic digestion procedure
adapted from Le Bouffant et al. (2010) in order to obtain single cell suspen-
sions. Briefly, ovarian pieces were first digested in 0.25% Trypsin–0.02%
EDTA (w/v) (#T4049, Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min at 37°C. Trypsin digestion
was stopped by adding 10% fetal bovine serum in M199 media and samples
were centrifuged at 350g for 5 min. The samples were then further
digested with 2 mg/ml collagenase (#C0130, Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.05 mg/
ml DNase (#DN25, Sigma-Aldrich) in M199 media for 5 min at 37°C.
Dispersed cells were centrifuged and resuspended in PBS. Before proceed-
ing to labeling, cell counting was performed on a Malassez Hemocytometer
(Trypan blue exclusion of live cells was included). Apoptotic cells were
labeled with FITC Annexin-V (BD pharmingen #556419) following the man-
ufacturer’s recommendations, coupled to necrotic nucleus staining with
3 μg/ml 7-Aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD; FluoProbes, Interchim #132303)
in 100 μl binding buffer. In Annexin-V versus 7-AAD contour plots with
quadrant gates, dead cells included apoptosis (early: AnnV+7AAD– and
late: AnnV+7AAD+) plus necrosis (AnnV–7AAD+) (Suppl. Fig. S1B). To
identify germ cells, a plasma membrane M2A labeling was performed using
anti-D240 mouse monoclonal antibody (abcam # 77854, diluted 1:200) in
the presence of 10% FCS and incubated 30 min at room temperature (RT).
Detection was allowed by a R-Phycoerythrin coupled anti-Mouse IgG (H +
L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch # 715-116-150). To evaluate cell death and
germ cell dynamics, a minimum of twenty thousand cells were acquired and
analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) equipped
with CellQuest software.
Immunohistochemistry and stereology
Immunohistochemistry was performed on 4% paraformaldehyde-PBS and
Bouin solution-fixed, paraffin-embedded ovaries. Each fifth 5 μm-thick sec-
tion was used for immunohistochemistry with cell-specific labeling. After
unwaxing and rehydration, sections were blocked for 20 min at RT with
10% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS before overnight incubation at
4°C with the primary antibody diluted in Dako antibody diluent (Dako
Cytomation, Trappes, France). Apoptotic cells were stained with a rabbit
anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody (1:150; Cell Signaling Tech. #9661,
Ozyme, Saint Quentin en Yvelines, France), proliferating cells with a
mouse anti-Ki67 antibody (1:100; Dako #M7240) and germ cells with a
mouse anti-M2A antibody (1:100, clone D2-40; Abcam #ab77854) or a
rabbit anti-LIN28 (1:300, Abcam #ab46020). An antigen retrieval step at
80°C for 40 min with 10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA buffer, pH 9 for cleaved
caspase-3 or 10 mM citrate buffer, pH 6 for Ki67, M2A and LIN28 was
necessary. The secondary antibodies were biotinylated goat anti-rabbit or
rabbit anti-mouse antibodies (1:500; E0342 and E0464, respectively,
Dako). Sections were developed with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase
(Vectastain ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and
3,3’-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Sigma Aldrich Chemicals) and
counterstained with hematoxylin. Stained sections were examined and photo-
graphed under the light microscope (Olympus BX51). Pictures of sections
were captured with a scanner NanoZoomer 2.0 RS (Hamamatsu, Tokyo,
Japan) at 40× magnification. The surfaces of 5–10 sections covering the whole
explant were calculated with NDPview software (Hamamatsu, Tokyo, Japan).
ImageJ software (US National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) was
used to perform the cell counting based on stereological principles. Cells were
counted in at least five sections and apoptotic cells counts reported as num-
ber per unit surface area of the section, while proliferating cells are reported
as the percentage of Ki67-positive cells in a population of KI67-negative cells.
Prostaglandin measurement
Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels were measured in culture media of ovarian
explants after 1 day of exposure by an ELISA method (intra-assay CV
3.7–30.4% and inter-assay CV 6.4–35%; PG E2 EIA Kit—Monoclonal
Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Each sample was
assayed in duplicate.
Ibuprofen assay
Ibuprofen was extracted from human plasma by solid phase extraction
using 10 mg HLB Oasis cartridges (Waters, UK). Briefly, 50 μl plasma was
enriched with 1ng deuterium-labeled acetaminophen (APAP-d4; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) as internal standard. Cartridges were conditioned
with methanol and water, the sample loaded and washed with water − 5%
methanol and then eluted with 1 ml methanol. The eluate was reduced to
dryness under nitrogen at 40°C and reconstituted in mobile phase (100 μl
water/acetonitrile
(70:30,
v/v)).
Chromatographic
separation
was
achieved by injecting 20 μl sample onto an Acquity UPLC system with an
ACE Excel C18-AR column (150 × 2.1 mm; 2 μm) protected by a Kinetex
KrudKatcher (Phenomenex) and operated at 30°C. Following separation,
ibuprofen was detected on a QTrap 5500 triple quadrupole mass spec-
trometer (Seiex, Warrington, UK) operated in positive ion electrospray
mode (5.5 kV, 550°C, ion source gas 60/40). Transitions monitored were
m/z 207.1 → 161.1 and m/z 156.1 → 114.1 for ibuprofen and APAP-d4,
respectively. The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid (Sigma
Aldrich) in water and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (B) at a flow rate of
0.5 ml/min. Gradient elution was achieved with a total run time of 9 min
from 30% to 100% B. Ibuprofen eluted at 5.70 min and the internal stand-
ard, APAP-d4 eluted at 1.1 min.
Quantitative PCR
RNAs were extracted from ovarian explants using All Prep RNA/DNA/
protein extraction kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Total RNAs (250 ng) were reverse transcribed with iScript cDNA synthe-
sis kit (Biorad) and quantitative PCR was performed using the iTaq© uni-
versal SYBR green supermix (Biorad) according to manufacturer’s
instructions in a Cfx384 OneTouch Real-Time PCR system (Biorad). The
following amplification program was used: an initial denaturation of 3 min
at 95°C, 40 cycles of 10 s denaturation at 95°C and 30 s at 62°C for
annealing and extension. Dissociation curves were produced using a ther-
mal melting profile performed after the last PCR cycle. To avoid amplifica-
tion of contaminating genomic DNA, primer pairs were selected on either
side of an intron. RPLP0 and RPS20 mRNA were used as internal controls
for normalization (Table I). Results were calculated by the ΔΔCT method
as n-fold differences in target gene expression, relative to the reference
gene and calibrator sample which is constituted of an equal mixture of all
the samples tested specifically in each tested organ.

 Statistical analysis
For each multivariate analysis (cell death, cell counts), the statistical frame-
work included (i) a global analysis of the effect of exposure to ibuprofen
with a non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis sum rank test; (ii) every time a global
significant effect was predicted, post-hoc non-parametric tests between
control and ibuprofen-treated samples at different dose (from 1 to
100 μM) or age (from 7 to 12 DW) were performed (Wilcoxon or Mann–
Whitney tests) and corrected for multiple testing with Bonferroni correc-
tion. Statistically significant post-hoc tests are indicated by (*) if the P-value
corrected for multiple testing is below 0.05, (**) below 0.01 and (***)
below 0.001. The free software environment for statistical computing and
graphics R was used to perform the calculations.
Results
Ibuprofen crosses the placental barrier
To get insights into the range of concentrations of ibuprofen the fetus
can be exposed to, ibuprofen concentration in the umbilical cord of 13
fetuses between 8 and 12 DW were measured (Table II). Ibuprofen
concentrations were on average ± SEM 7.1 ± 5.02 μM (0.37–14.5 μM)
when pregnant women had ingested 800 mg of ibuprofen 2–5 h prior to
termination of pregnancy. Following ingestion of a single dose of
400 mg, ibuprofen concentration was on average ± SEM 2.09 ±
1.25 μM (0.83–6.95 μM) in the umbilical serum. Ibuprofen was non-
detectable when the women had not used the analgesic (n = 5 samples).
Consequently, concentrations covering the range of those found in the
umbilical blood were chosen for subsequent ex vivo experiments.
Ibuprofen suppresses ovarian prostaglandin
E2 production
One day of exposure to ibuprofen at 10 μM significantly decreased by
66.3% prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production by explants aged 7–12
DW. The average level (±SEM) of PGE2 in control samples was 353 ±
73.9 pg/ml (n = 21), while levels were reduced to 119 ± 10.6 pg/ml
(n = 16) in ibuprofen samples (P = 0.0062). No age-window of sensi-
tivity for effect on PGE2 production was observed.
Ibuprofen impairs ovarian cell growth
Fetal ovarian explants (7–12 DW) were exposed for a week to a range
of ibuprofen concentrations (from 1 to 100 μM) and the overall cell
number was assessed (Fig. 1A). In uncultivated ovaries, the total num-
ber of cells per ovary increased exponentially from 2.6 × 105 at 7 DW
to 1.3 × 106 at 12 DW (Suppl. Fig. S1A). This number further
increased during the 7 days of culture in control conditions (Suppl.
Fig. S1A). By contrast, when the organs were exposed to ibuprofen at
the concentration of 10 μM for 7 days, the total ovarian cell count was
significantly reduced (of −50% on average) compared to the unex-
posed controls, regardless of the developmental age of the explant
(Fig. 1A). Although not significant for every age group, a reduction of
the cell number was also observed with a 1 μM (−20% on average)
and a 100 μM dose (−20% on average).
To determine whether ibuprofen-induced ovarian cell depletion
could result from a decrease in cell proliferation, we scored the per-
centage of KI67-positive cells, including both somatic and germ cells, in
histological sections after 7 days of culture (Fig. 1B and C). Before 8
DW, ibuprofen at all tested concentrations induced a massive
decrease in the percentage of KI67-positive cell density. In 8–12 DW
explants, cell proliferation also exhibited a statistically significant
decline of KI67-positive cell density at 1 and 10 μM ibuprofen, but not
at 100 μM (Fig. 1C).

of total ovarian cells could result from a loss of cell viability, cell death

Effects of ibuprofen on ovarian development

 was quantified using a flow cytometry-based Annexin-V labeling
coupled with 7-AAD nuclear staining (Suppl. Fig. S1B). Briefly, in
Annexin-V versus 7-AAD contour plots with quadrant gates, dead
cells include apoptotic cells displaying annexin V in the outer mem-
brane (early: AnnV+7AAD– and late: AnnV+7AAD+) and necrotic
cells in which the 7AAD dye could enter the nucleus (AnnV–7AAD+).
To eliminate a potential cytotoxic impact of the organotypic culture
itself, we assessed cell death before and during the 7 days of culture in
control conditions (Suppl. Fig. S1C). Overall, the majority (94–96%) of
the cells appeared to be viable, total cell death only reaching a max-
imum of 6%. This cell death rate remained stable from Day 0 to Day 7
regardless of the age of the explant.
Following ibuprofen exposure, the percentage of global cell death,
including both apoptotic and necrotic death, was consistently higher
compared to vehicle-exposed explants for both 7 DW fetuses (P =
0.0028) and 8–12 DW fetuses (P < 0.001) (Fig. 2A). Whilst 1 μM
ibuprofen induced a weak cytotoxic effect, statistically significant only
in the 8–12 DW group (P = 0.098, +42% at 7 DW, and P = 0.028,
+45% at 8–12 DW), 10 μM ibuprofen concentration induced a
marked accumulation of dead cells (P = 0.007, +85% at 7 DW, and
P < 0.001, +170% at 8–12 DW) (Fig. 2A). Notably, the cytotoxic
effect of 10 μM ibuprofen was intensified in the oldest explant group
(10.47 ± 2.11 versus 16.14 ± 1.88; Means ± SEM of 7 versus 8–12
DW). When uncoupling apoptosis from necrosis, only the former
cell death mechanism significantly increased in both exposed age
groups (Fig. 2A).
To further investigate the effects on cell death, a histological analysis
on ovarian explant sections was carried out using cleaved caspase-3
staining as a hallmark of apoptosis (Fig. 2B and C). Overall, exposure
to ibuprofen for 7 days resulted in an increase in the density of cleaved
caspase-3-positive cells for both 7 and 8–12 DW groups; however this
only reached statistical significance in 8–12 DW fetuses (P < 0.001)

 compared to 7 DW fetuses (P = 0.072) (Fig. 2C). Both the 10 and
100 μM concentrations of ibuprofen induced a dramatic accumulation
of apoptotic cells (P < 0.001, +208%, and +182%, respectively) in
8–12 DW fetuses, whereas the 1 μM dose–response did not pass the
significance threshold. It is noteworthy that the quantitative analysis
could not be performed in several 10 and 100 μM ibuprofen-exposed
tissue sections (7 and 2 individuals, respectively) due to a massive deg-
radation and loss of integrity of the tissue itself. These data indicate
that ibuprofen is cytotoxic, resulting in apoptosis in 7–12 DW fetal
ovaries, with exacerbated effect when gestational age of the fetus
increases. Quantitative PCR analysis of several cell proliferation
(marker of proliferation Ki67 MKI67), cycle (cyclin B1, CCNB1; Cyclin
D1, CCND1; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1 A, CDKN1A; check-
point kinase 1, CHEK1) and death markers (tumor protein p53, TP53)
showed a significant increase in the expression of TP53 and CDKN1A
(Fig. 2D).

Effects of ibuprofen on ovarian development
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article-abstract/33/3/482/4831088 by guest on 02 June 2019
 Ovarian fetal germ cells are highly sensitive
to ibuprofen
The large size of the cleaved caspase-3 positive cells revealed by our
histological study (Fig. 2B) suggested that the apoptotic cells in ibuprofen-
exposed explants were likely to be germ cells. To verify our hypothesis,
we used an antibody targeting LIN28, a marker of fetal germ cells (Childs
et al., 2012), which revealed a decrease of the density of LIN28-positive
cells (Fig. 3A and Suppl. Fig. S2A-B). Another marker of fetal germ cells,
M2A (Jin et al., 2010) enabled the identification of two populations of
germ cells (Suppl. Fig. S2C), as reflected by two distinct peaks in flow
cytometry. (Suppl. Fig. S2D). In accordance with the unchanged viability
profile observed along the 7 days of culture in control medium (Suppl.
Fig. S1C), the percentage of M2A high-positive cells was not affected dur-
ing the week of ex vivo culture of 7–12 DW explants (Suppl. Fig. S2E). By
contrast, the proportion of M2A-germ cells increased steadily between
the isolation of the organ (Day 0) and the end of the 7 days of culture.
As measured by flow cytometry, the population expressing high levels
of M2A (10 to >15% of the total ovarian cells depending on the fetal
age, Suppl. Fig. S2E) was significantly diminished following ibuprofen
exposure (P = 0.0038 and P < 0.001, for 7 DW and 8–12 DW, respect-
ively), with a large reduction when exposed to 10 μM (Fig. 3B). In terms
of total M2A-positive cell number, the germ cell population expanded
exponentially from 7 to 12 DW, increasing from 4 × 104 to over 3 ×
105 M2A-high positive cells per ovary in control conditions (Fig. 3C).
Following ibuprofen treatment, 1 and 100 μM doses both induced on
average a 30% depletion of the germ cell count, whereas 10 μM ibupro-
fen led to a significant (50–75%) loss of germ cells, depending on the
fetal age (Fig. 3C). Thus, unequivocally, ibuprofen exposure resulted in a
decrease in the number of M2A-positive germ cells.
Ibuprofen-induced adverse effects after 2
days of exposure were not reversible by
a 5-day withdrawal period
We next investigated the effects of shorter exposures of 10 μM ibu-
profen, a dose shown to be deleterious for the organ (Fig. 4).
Whereas overall cell death remained low in all control explants

 regardless of the fetal age, the percentage of apoptotic cells progres-
sively increased as early as 2 days after the beginning of the treatment
(Fig. 4A). Ibuprofen significantly induced cell death from 4 days of
exposure in the 7 DW age group (P = 0.028 and 0.0079 after 4 and 7
days, respectively), and as early as 2 days of exposure in the 8–12 DW
group (P = 0.00058; 3.84 × 10–7, and 3.03 × 10–8 after 2, 4 and 7
days, respectively) (Fig. 4A). In addition, in young 7 DW explants,
M2A-positive germ cell depletion was progressively enhanced and
became significant after 7 days of ibuprofen exposure (Fig. 4B). Of
concern, M2A-germ cell depletion in 8–12 DW explants reached its
maximum of −66.7% as rapidly as 2 days following ibuprofen
treatment.
We next assessed the recovery capacity of this organ following ibu-
profen withdrawal. Explants (10–12 DW) were exposed to 10 μM ibu-
profen for 2 days, and subsequently cultured in control media without
ibuprofen for a further 5 days (Fig. 5A). No significant difference in the
overall cell death percentage at 7 days of culture was seen whether or
not a 5-day recovery period had been allowed after the initial 2 days of
ibuprofen-treatment (15.98 ± 2.38 versus 11.86 ± 1.31, Means ±
SEM, P = 0.47). Likewise, the apoptosis rate induced by 2 days of
ibuprofen exposure was not significantly reduced after a 5-day recov-
ery (Fig. 5B; 13.50 ± 2.27 versus 9.58 ± 1.52, Means ± SEM, P =
0.43). However, the percentage of M2A-positive germ cells increased
along with the 5 days recovery compared to the 2-day ibuprofen treat-
ment alone, returning to its control level (Fig. 5C). These data most
probably indicate that the cytotoxic effect induced by a 2 day ibupro-
fen exposure was not fully rescued by a 5 day-long withdrawal of the
drug, despite an improvement of the germ cell percentage.
Discussion
Ibuprofen is one of the most widely used over-the-counter analgesic–
antipyretic–anti-inflammatory medication. It has even been presented
as ‘the mildest NSAID with the fewest side effects which has been in

Effects of ibuprofen on ovarian development

 clinical use for a long time’ (Rainsford, 2009; Servey and Chang, 2014).
During the third trimester of pregnancy, all NSAIDs are currently
contra-indicated due to risks of severe cardiopulmonary toxicity and
renal dysfunction in the fetus (Black and Hill, 2003; Servey and Chang,
2014). Several studies have reported the consumption of ibuprofen by
pregnant women, with percentages of exposed women reaching up to
30% (Kristensen et al., 2016; Van Marter et al., 2013). Consistent with
current recommendations, the majority of women using ibuprofen do
so during the first trimester and frequency decreases thereafter
(Glover et al., 2003; Nezvalova-Henriksen et al., 2013; Palmsten et al.,
2016; Stephansson et al., 2011; Wen et al., 2008; Werler et al., 2005).
We here report that ibuprofen, a non-selective inhibitor of COX,
induces a decreased cell proliferation and an increased cell death in
first trimester human fetal ovaries mainly due to effects on fetal germ
cells. This raises concern about ibuprofen consumption by pregnant
women during the fetal ovarian organogenesis period and a subse-
quent risk for the establishment of the follicular reserve.
Ibuprofen crosses the placental barrier
during the first trimester of pregnancy
Paracetamol and acetyl salicylic acid can cross the human placental
barrier (Jacobson et al., 1991; Levy et al., 1975; Naga Rani et al., 1989;
Weigand et al., 1984). In rats and rabbits, ibuprofen and its metabo-
lites can also readily enter the fetal circulation (Adams et al., 1969). In
human, ibuprofen was found in the meconium of newborn infants
(Alano et al., 2001). However, to the best of our knowledge, there has
not been any direct measurement of the ability of ibuprofen to cross
the placental barrier and its subsequent plasma levels in human
fetuses.
Here, we took advantage of the use of ibuprofen for preventive
analgesia by women undergoing abortion to investigate the circulating
levels of ibuprofen in umbilical cord blood. We were able to reveal
that when the woman ingested ibuprofen before abortion, it was
detectable in the umbilical cord blood in concentrations ranging from
0.4 to 14 μM. Notably, the range of circulating ibuprofen depended
more on the delay between ingestion and blood collection than on the
ingested dose (400 versus 800 mg), the highest levels being found
when this delay was between 3 and 6 h. In adults, the maximal thera-
peutic plasma concentration for ibuprofen has been defined in the
100 μM range for oral doses between 400 and 800 mg (Ceppi Monti
et al., 1992; Kallstrom et al., 1988; Karttunen et al., 1990; Regazzi
et al., 1986) and about 200 μM in children (Scott et al., 1999). Our
results thus show for the first time that placental transfer of ibuprofen
occurs as early as in the first trimester, and exposes the fetus to con-
centrations between 1 and 10 μM.
Ibuprofen impacts the growth of the human
fetal ovary
Ovarian development is characterized by cell proliferation of both
somatic and germ cell lineages (Fulton et al., 2005). During the first tri-
mester, the oogonia actively proliferate and from the end of the first
trimester, a subset of germ cells commit to meiosis (Jorgensen and
Rajpert-De Meyts, 2014). In agreement with previous histological stud-
ies (Mamsen et al., 2011), we report that in uncultured ovaries, the
total number of cells at least quadruples from 7 to 12 DW (2.6 × 105
cells at 7 DW versus 1.3 × 106 cells at 12 DW). Importantly, cell
growth kept occurring over the course of 7 days in culture (4.5 × 105
cells, i.e. +190,000 cells for 7 DW and 2 × 106 cells, i.e. +700,000
cells for 12 DW cultured explants). The active proliferation of the
germ cells was also evidenced ex vivo, where the M2A-positive cell
population proliferates five times from 7 to 12 DW after 7 days of cul-
ture (from 4.7 × 104 to over 3 × 105 germ cells per cultured ovary)
and increases 1.5 times after 7 days of culture (from 2.2 × 105 in
uncultivated ovaries to 3 × 105 germ cells after 7 days of culture for 12
DW ovaries). Accordingly, KI67 immunostaining confirmed both som-
atic and germ cell proliferation ex vivo. Ovarian development during
the first trimester has also been characterized by a low rate of apop-
tosis where apoptotic cells were mostly identified as oogonia (Fulton
et al., 2005). Consistently, we found a similarly weak density of cleaved
caspase-3-positive cells after 7 days of control culture and our flow
cytometry data displayed equally low cell death rate in both fresh
organ and ex vivo culture (close to 6%). Overall, these data suggest
that the organotypic culture by itself did not impact either the high
proliferation or the low apoptotic rates, therefore allowing the devel-
opment of the ovary. By contrast, following exposure to ibuprofen, we
have shown a reduction of the overall number of ovarian cells, effect
coupled to a dramatic decline of cell proliferation and a significant
enhancement of apoptosis, but not necrosis. This suggests that ibupro-
fen compromised both proliferation and viability, ultimately resulting in
a loss of ovarian cells. At this stage, we cannot speculate if both events
are linked or simply concomitant.
It has been over two decades since several studies have reported a
role for ibuprofen and other NSAIDs in cancer prevention (Matos and
Jordan, 2015). In cancer cell lines, ibuprofen is also known to alter cell
proliferation and viability, the resulting cell growth slowdown being
often associated with cell cycle arrest. In many cases, such as colon
carcinoma (Andrews et al., 2008; Janssen et al., 2006, 2008), prostate
cancer (Andrews et al., 2002, 2008; Minnery and Getzenberg, 2005),
oral cavity cancer cell lines (Kim et al., 2004; Thurnher et al., 2001)
and ovarian cancer cell lines (Andrews et al., 2008; Duncan et al.,
2012; Lima et al., 2015), ibuprofen also induces apoptosis. Similar to
its mechanism of action in cancer cells, we observed that ibuprofen
alters both proliferation and cell death in human fetal ovary. At a
molecular level, studies in several cell lines have suggested a TP53-
dependent mechanism of ibuprofen toxicity that also involves an
increase in the expression of CDKN1A (also known as p21) (Bonelli
et al., 2011; Ikegaki et al., 2014; Janssen et al., 2008; Tsai et al., 2004).
We found similar increases in TP53 and CDKN1A expression in the
human fetal ovary after exposure to ibuprofen, suggesting that ibupro-
fen toxicity in the human fetal ovary may use a similar signaling path-
way, and may act on molecular targets placed at the crossroad of
proliferation and cell death. Further experiments will be required to
investigate the fine molecular mechanism of action of ibuprofen on the
human fetal ovary.
Interestingly, in four ovarian cancer cell lines (SKOV-3, CAOV-3,
36M2 and SW626) (Duncan et al., 2012), only the high concentration
of 200 μM ibuprofen was shown to induce apoptosis, whereas doses
ranging from 20 to 100 μM had no cytotoxic effect on the same cells.
This suggests that ibuprofen may use different signaling pathways
depending on the concentration of exposure, as well as the tumoral/
physiological state of the cellular target. In our ex vivo model, the over-
all impact of ibuprofen was most pronounced when used at 10 μM and
notably more variable at 100 μM. Non-monotonic dose–response

 curves have been described in the testis where several endocrine dis-
ruptor compounds exhibited these curves (Gaudriault et al., 2017). In
the ovary, only two studies have investigated several concentrations
(of either Bisphenol A or dexamethasone) and found linear dose–
response curves (Brieno-Enriquez et al., 2011; Poulain et al., 2012).
Non-linear dose–response effects are often associated with differ-
ences in the mechanism of action, such as induction of the detoxifica-
tion pathway, alteration of signaling pathways or saturation of
metabolic pathways (Vandenberg et al., 2012). Therefore, ibuprofen
mechanism of action requires further investigations. Importantly, how-
ever, it is noteworthy that during the first trimester the developing
fetuses are more likely to be exposed to the active concentrations of
10 μM and below.
Ibuprofen targets the germ cell lineage
We have shown that 10 μM ibuprofen efficiently inhibited PGE2 pro-
duction by human fetal ovaries, as has been shown previously in
human fetal testis culture (Ben Maamar et al., 2017; Mazaud-Guittot
et al., 2013), and in vivo in the rat (Dean et al., 2016). In the human fetal
ovary, COX1 is expressed by somatic cells, while COX2 and PTGES
are confined to germ cells during the first and second trimesters
(Bayne et al., 2009). Furthermore, previous studies have reported that
exposure of human fetal ovaries to PGE2 (8 h exposure at 0.1 μM)
increased the mRNA levels of MLC1 and INHA, two markers of mature
germ cells (Bayne et al., 2009), suggesting a favorable impact of PGE2
on germ cell development. In the rat, in utero exposure to either indo-
methacin (0.8 mg/kg d) or paracetamol (350 mg/kg.d) between 13.5
and 21.5 days post-conception (dpc) altered the expression of some
germ cell markers (Dean et al., 2016), while ex vivo exposure of 12.5
dpc mouse ovaries to 100 μM paracetamol for 3 days did not alter the
expression of several typical germ cell markers (Holm et al., 2016). In
the human fetal ovary, our ex vivo data reveal that ibuprofen massively
impacts the viability of the germ cell lineage. It is thus reasonable to
propose that the exacerbated effects of ibuprofen in 8–12 DW ovaries
(compared to 7 DW organs) may be related to the increasing propor-
tion in germ cells and their production of PGE2 at this stage.
Noteworthy, we observed that withdrawal of ibuprofen for 5 days
after continuous exposure for 2 days allowed for a rescue of M2A-
positive germ cell percentage, but with a persistent high apoptosis
rate. We hypothesize that germ cells surviving the 2 days of ibuprofen
exposure may proliferate rapidly after termination of drug administra-
tion, resulting in complete ovarian potential 5 days after exposure
ended. Therefore, at the cellular level, the negative effect of ibuprofen
on the germ cell lineage viability might be limited. This does not how-
ever exclude potential damage at the molecular level, such as DNA
damage as suggested by inherited impact of paracetamol and indo-
methacin, another NSAID, in the germ cells of the rat (Dean et al.,
2016).
While overexpression of COX2 and increased prostaglandin biosyn-
thesis has been observed during carcinogenesis (Harris, 2007),
NSAIDs anti-tumoral effect has been to a large part attributed to their
inhibition of COX enzymes (Matos and Jordan, 2015). Because COX2
expression is restricted to germ cells during fetal development (Bayne
et al., 2009), it could be hypothesized that ibuprofen would preferen-
tially target cells expressing high COX2 levels, such as tumor and fetal
germ cells. However, if the canonical mechanism of action of ibuprofen
and other NSAIDs rely on the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis,
ibuprofen can also display cytotoxic effects independently of COX2
expression or activity (Andrews et al., 2008; Janssen et al., 2008). The
specific mechanism(s) of action of ibuprofen on ovotoxicity and germ
cell viability thus requires further detailed investigations.
Overall, our data reveal that a 2–7 days exposure to the non-
selective COX inhibitor ibuprofen, at concentrations relevant to in
utero conditions impacts the germ cell stockpile in human fetal ovaries
in the first trimester of pregnancy. The incomplete capacity for rescue
of the fetal ovary to ibuprofen-induced damages suggests that pro-
longed exposure to ibuprofen during fetal life may lead to long-term
effects on female reproductive function. This raises concern about ibu-
profen consumption by pregnant women during the fetal ovarian
organogenesis period, and the subsequent risk for the establishment of
the follicular reserve.
