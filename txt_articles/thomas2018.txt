Multi-Institutional, Prospective 
Clinical Utility Study Evaluating 
the Impact of the 92-Gene Assay 
(CancerTYPE ID) on Final Diagnosis 
and Treatment Planning in Patients 
With Metastatic Cancer With an 
Unknown or Unclear Diagnosis
INTRODUCTION
Metastatic cancers that are initially character-
ized as unknown primary (CUP), or with other 
features that may lead to diagnostic uncertainty 
 
with respect to tumor type diagnosis, can pro-
long the clinicopathologic workup and result in 
delays in the initiation of treatment, additional 
costs, and relatively poor patient outcomes.1-3 
Purpose Metastatic cancers of unknown primary or with unclear diagnoses pose diag-
nostic and management challenges, often leading to poor outcomes. Studies of the 92-
gene assay have demonstrated improved diagnostic accuracy compared with standard 
pathology techniques and improved survival in patients treated on the basis of assay 
results. The current study assessed the clinical impact of the 92-gene assay on diagnostic 
and treatment decisions for patients with unknown or uncertain diagnoses.
Methods Patients in this prospective, multi-institutional, decision-impact study included 
those for whom the 92-gene assay was ordered as part of routine care. Participating phy-
sicians completed electronic case report forms that contained standardized, specialty- 
specific questionnaires. Data collection included patient and tumor characteristics and 
clinical history. The key study objective of clinical impact was calculated on the basis of 
changes in final diagnosis and treatment after testing.
Results Data collection included 444 patients, 107 physicians (73 oncologists and 34 pa-
thologists), and 28 sites. Molecular diagnoses from 22 different tumor types and subtypes 
across all cases were provided in 95.5% of patients with a reportable result (n = 397). 
Physicians reported that the 92-gene assay was used broadly for diagnostic dilemmas 
that ranged from single suspected tumor type (29%) to a differential diagnosis of two or 
more suspected tumor types (30%) or cancers of unknown primary (41%). Integration of 
92-gene assay results led to a change in the recommended treatment in 47% of patients.
Conclusion Findings from this clinical utility study demonstrate that the 92-gene assay 
led to a change in treatment decisions in every other patient case. These data additionally 
define the role of this assay in clinical practice and strongly support the consideration of 
molecular tumor typing in the diagnosis and treatment planning of patients with metastatic 
cancer with unknown or uncertain diagnosis.

 Novel technologies and therapeutic options to help 
improve patient outcomes are needed. Numer-
ous diagnostic and treatment strategies, such as 
enhanced pathologic techniques, molecular classi-
fication of tumor type and subtype, comprehensive 
mutational profiling, and novel combination regi-
mens of cytotoxics plus biolo 
gics, have been pro-
posed without universal consensus.4-10
Investigational approaches to personalize the 
systemic treatment of metastatic cancer solely 
on the basis of the patient’s somatic genomic 
alterations, disregarding histologic context, have 
had mixed and disappointing results.11-14 Results 
from several recent phase II studies that eval-
uated targeted agents for specific genomic alter-
ations across a variety of tumor types have 
provided evidence that mutations are not targe-
table in similar manners across tumor types.11,12 
Thus, the clinical utility of this approach is unclear. 
Whereas driver mutations matter, the integra-
tion of tumor type and subtype remains critical 
when considering the efficacy of a targeted ther-
apy aimed at a putative driver mutation.15 Given 
that empirical chemotherapy approaches are 
associated with poor prognosis in patients with 
CUP or uncertain diagnoses, it might be more 
effective to refocus on methods with which to 
identify patient tumor type and subtype to guide 
therapy.1,16
Gene expression profiling–based molecular clas-
sification of tumors might prove efficacious by 
helping to identify the primary tumor type and 
histologic subtype for patients with unknown 
or uncertain diagnoses. The 92-gene assay 
(Cancer 
TYPE ID) is a real-time RT-PCR–based 
assay that utilizes differential gene expression to 
assign tumors to one of 50 tumor types and sub-
types in its spectrum. In clinical studies, molec-
ular tumor classification using the 92-gene assay 
demonstrated 87% accuracy (95% CI, 84% to 
89%), improved diagnostic accuracy compared 
with standard pathology techniques in poorly 
and undifferentiated metastatic tumors, and 
increased overall survival in patients with CUP 
who were treated on the basis of assay-directed 
therapy.16-18 A survey-based retrospective study 
assessed the clinical utility of the 92-gene assay 
in decision making in clinical practice, but there 
have been no large-scale prospective studies to 
assess its impact in the clinical setting.19 The 
current study assessed the clinical utility of 
the 92-gene assay in patients with unknown or 
uncertain diagnoses that were submitted as part 
of routine clinical care in the community set-
ting. The primary objective was to assess clinical 
impact on the basis of changes in diagnostic and 
treatment decisions after the incorporation of 
92-gene assay results.
METHODS
Study Design
Observational in nature, the current study was 
prospectively defined to evaluate multidisci-
plinary clinical utility in patients for whom phy-
sicians ordered the 92-gene assay as a clinical 
workup tool to help identify or narrow the tumor 
type and subtype diagnosis. Patients were eligi-
ble to participate if a biospecimen was available 
for testing. Study protocol included standard-
ized physician questionnaires and a prespecified 
analysis plan, and was reviewed and approved 
by an independent institutional review board. 
A waiver was granted and informed consent was 
not required by participating institutions. Pre-
specified objectives were to examine the diag-
nostic and clinical utility of the 92-gene assay in 
oncology and pathology practice to characterize 
indications of use, and to evaluate its potential 
integration and impact on patient management 
by comparing changes in diagnosis and treatment 
selection after testing.
Data Collection
Physicians were required to complete standard 
ized, 
discipline-specific questionnaires—pathology 
 
and oncology—after receiving a 92-gene assay 
test report. Physicians entered responses to 
questionnaires via a secure, Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act–compliant, 
 
Web-based electronic case report form (eCRF). 
The pathology eCRF consisted of 11 multi-
ple choice questions and four questions that 
 
required written responses (biopsy quality, 
 
number and types of immunohistochemistry 
[IHC] performed, and 92-gene assay result). The 
 
medical oncologist eCRF consisted of 11 mul-
tiple choice questions and five questions that 
required written responses (time between biopsy 
and treatment, clinical diagnosis for first-line 
treatment, name of first-line treatment, other 
diagnostic or clinical considerations for choos-
ing first-line therapy, and 92-gene assay result). 
For patient cases with scant tissue or insufficient

 RNA quality determined to be quantity not suf-
ficient, in which a molecular prediction could 
not be determined, physicians completed quan-
tity not sufficient eCRFs that consisted of four 
multiple choice questions and two questions that 
required written response (biopsy quality and 
number of IHC performed). eCRF forms are 
included in the Data Supplement.
Physicians were instructed on the Web por-
tal and eCRF via a standardized training pro-
gram. For the pathology questionnaire (Data 
Supplement: Pathology eCRF Question 7 and 
Oncology eCRF Question 8, respectively), phy-
sicians were instructed to align terminology 
with the 50 tumor types and subtypes classified 
by the 92-gene assay. Physicians were required 
to complete the questionnaires within 2 weeks 
of the date assay results were made available. 
No patient-protected health information was 
collected as part of the eCRF. The testing lab-
oratory was blinded to the working clinical diag-
nosis from the eCRF.
92-Gene Assay
The 92-gene assay was performed as previously 
described.17,20 In brief, the assay—real-time RT- 
PCR—was performed on isolated total RNA 
from tumor cells that were enriched by either 
microdissection or laser microdissection. Assay 
results were reported if they met the PCR ana-
lytical quality control threshold for internal 
controls—PCR cycling threshold > 30. A pre-
specified computational algorithm generated 
probabilities for primary tumor type and sub-
type on the basis of the degree of similarity of 
the submitted sample to a reference database of 
gene expression information from more than 
2,000 tumors of known tumor type. The test 
report provided a prediction of the main tumor 
type and subtype on the basis of the highest rel-
ative probability and any additional tumor types 
that cannot be ruled out. The report also pro-
vided a list of tumor types that could be excluded 
with 95% confidence.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical considerations of study size were based 
on an anticipated treatment recommendation 
change rate of 35%, targeting a sample size of at 
least 156 patients to ensure a 95% two-sided CI 
width of 15%. Descriptive statistics were used to 
summarize the case and patient characteristics. 
The analytical success rate was calculated on the 
basis of the proportion of cases with a reportable 
result. The primary objective of the study was to 
measure the clinical impact of the 92-gene assay 
results on the basis of changes in patient treat-
ment, the narrowing of treatment options, or 
the elimination of a treatment option (“a,” “b”, 
 
or “c” on question 15 of the Oncology Ques-
tionnaire in the Data Supplement). Patients 
were considered eligible for a targeted agent 
if the physician responded “a," "b," or c” in 
question 15 and there was a US Food and Drug 
Administration–approved targeted therapy that 
was recommended by the National Comprehensive 
Cancer Network for the molecular diagnosis 
provided by the 92-gene assay.
RESULTS
Patient enrollment began in February 2013 and 
closed October 2014 after enrolling 444 patients 
with 107 physicians—73 medical oncologists 
and 34 pathologists—from 28 sites—21 oncol-
ogy sites and seven pathology sites—across the 
United States. Of the 444 patients enrolled, 
397 had sufficient RNA for analysis, which cor-
responded to an overall analytical success rate 
of 89%, taking into account samples that were 
determined to have insufficient tissue on pathol-
ogy review before testing. The primary objective 
was calculated in patients that received antican-
cer therapy (n = 203). A patient flow diagram is 
shown in Figure 1.
Biopsy and Tumor Characteristics
The most common metastatic biopsy sites 
included the liver (23%), lymph nodes (17%), 
and lung (14%; Fig 2A). Samples were derived 
primarily from core needle biopsies (49%) 
and fine-needle aspirations (11%; Fig 2B). For 
fine-needle aspiration samples with inherently 
limited cellularity, the analytical success rate for 
the assay was 93%. Of the samples for clinical 
testing that were submitted by pathologists 
 
(n = 126), 48% were poorly differentiated or 
undifferentiated, 29% were moderately differenti-
ated, and 4% were well differentiated (19% were 
without an assigned grade).

 Diagnostic Testing and Preassay Diagnosis
Factors that contributed to an oncologist’s deci-
sion to order the 92-gene assay were multidisci-
plinary and included the following: no primary 
site of origin after clinical review and imaging 
(42%), a pathology report that indicated a dif-
ferential diagnosis (21%) or that indicated an 
unknown primary site (20%), and distinguishing 
between new cancer versus recurrence (16%). 
Data that were collected to better characterize 
the sequence of diagnostic testing demonstrated 
that 72% of physicians responded that patients 
had pathology and IHC studies performed 
before the 92-gene assay, 14% of samples were 
submitted for pathology and IHC evaluation 
and the 92-gene assay concurrently, and approx-
imately 14% of samples were submitted without 
an indication of the diagnostic sequence. The 
most common imaging tests were computed 
tomography scans (86%), fusion positron emis-
sion tomography/computed tomography scans 
(57%), magnetic resonance imaging (29%), 
 
ultrasound (28%), regular film radiographs (11%), 
or mammogram (11%; data not shown).
For pathologists, inconclusive IHC (50%) 
was the most common reason for ordering the 
92-gene assay. In these cases, 90% were submit-
ted for 92-gene assay testing after the first set of 
IHC stains were performed. The mean number 
of IHC stains performed before the molecular 
assay was ordered was 10 (median, nine; range, 
zero to 23; data not shown).
92-Gene Assay Results and Impact on 
Diagnosis
Of the 397 patients with sufficient tissue and 
RNA for a reportable result, the 92-gene assay 
provided a molecular-based tumor type and 
histologic subtype diagnosis in 379 patients 
(95.5%), whereas 4.5% had an indeterminate 
molecular diagnosis (Fig 1). Across all submit-
ted cases, the assay predicted 22 different tumor

 types. The most common diagnoses were pan-
creaticobiliary (21.9%), squamous cell carci-
noma (10.1%), lung adenocarcinoma (9.3%), 
and intestinal (8.6%) type tumors (Fig 3).
Working diagnoses before the 92-gene assay 
were assessed in the medical oncology subset 
(n = 271). Preassay working diagnoses were 
reported as a single suspected site in 79 patients 
(29%), a differential diagnosis of two or more 
suspected sites in 80 patients (30%), and CUP in 
112 patients (41%; Fig 4A). Comparison of the 
92-gene assay molecular diagnoses with preassay 
working diagnoses demonstrated that the assay 
provided a tumor type diagnosis that was not ini-
tially suspected in a large proportion of patients 
(Fig 4B). In patients with a single suspected pri-
mary site (n = 79), the 92-gene assay confirmed 
the suspected diagnosis in 60% of patients but 
provided a tumor type result that was not ini-
tially suspected in 39% of patients. In patients 
with a differential diagnosis (n = 80), the 92-gene 
assay narrowed the diagnosis in 66% of patients 
and provided a tumor type result that was not 
initially suspected in 27% of patients. In patients 
for whom the pathology report indicated CUP 
site (n = 112), the assay provided a molecular 
tumor type prediction in 97% of patients.
Impact on Treatment Planning
Of the 271 oncologist-submitted cases, 203 
patients (75%) received anticancer treatment 
after the 92-gene assay results were made avail-
able. The most common reasons for patients not 
receiving treatment were a rapid deterioration in 
the patient’s performance status (29%), patient 
death (14%), and a patient declination of treat-
ment (13%; Fig 1). After receiving the results of 
the 92-gene assay, medical oncologists modified 
their treatment recommendation in 47% of cases

 (Fig 5A). The assay resulted in similar changes in 
treatment recommendations in all three scenar-
ios of the original working diagnosis—48% of 
cases with a single suspected primary (n = 79), 
49% of differential diagnoses with two or more 
primaries (n = 80), and 42% of cases with an 
unknown primary site (n = 112).
Subset analysis within the most commonly 
predicted tumor type classes—those with ≥ 20 
cases—demonstrated that physicians changed 
their recommended treatment in 58% of GI 
cancers (n = 81), 54% of gynecologic and breast 
 
cancers (n = 28), and 44% of lung cancers 
 
(n = 27; Fig 5B). Molecular biomarker testing 
for somatic mutations—for example, EGFR, ALK, 
and KRAS—was ordered in 38% of cases and was 
primarily dependent on tumor type. Mutational 
biomarker testing was most commonly ordered 
after the 92-gene assay rendered a diagnosis of 
lung (81%) or colorectal cancer (67%).
DISCUSSION
Results from this large, multisite study have 
demonstrated that the 92-gene assay was used 
across a spectrum of diagnostic uncertainty, 
beyond CUPs, and included cases with differen-
tial diagnoses and those with a suspected diagno-
sis for confirmatory testing. The assay provided 
a molecular tumor type prediction in 97% of 
unknown primary cases with sufficient tissue for 
testing. In addition, the assay provided a diag-
nosis that was not initially suspected in a sub-
stantial proportion of patients who had either a 
single suspected diagnosis or differential diagnosis 
before testing with the 92-gene assay. The key 
finding of the study was that the incorporation 
of the 92-gene assay results led to changes in 
treatment recommendations in 47% of patients. 
This clinical impact was more pronounced in 
GI and gynecologic and breast tumor types, 
which suggests that the 92-gene assay may have 
additional utility in particular metastatic pre-
sentations in which standard approaches may be 
 
limited. Moreover, the impact on treatment rec-
ommendations was similar regardless of whether 
the preassay working diagnosis was CUP
, a dif-
ferential diagnosis, or a single suspected pri-
mary site. T
wenty-four percent of patients whose 
treatment decisions were changed after the inte-
gration of the 92-gene assay results received 
targeted therapy. Given the 30,000 to 50,000 
new cases of CUP in the United States every 
year,1,21,22 as well as a significant number of addi-
tional patients with some level of diagnostic 
ambiguity regarding tumor type or subtype, the 
implementation of molecular-based diagnostic 
assays may provide significant clinical impact.
A critical question that has been posed in clin-
ical oncology practice in recent years has been, 
in the age of precision medicine, comprehen-
sive mutational profiling, and targeted therapy

 approaches, what is both the current and future 
relevance of establishing the tumor type or cellu-
lar context of a metastatic cancer? Recent results 
from a number of basket trials have demonstrated 
that knowledge of tumor type and cellular con-
text remains fundamental for the interpretation 
of potentially targetable DNA mutations and 
the recommendation of treatment approaches in 
metastatic cancer. Whereas molecularly targeted 
agents have been demonstrated to be effective in 
tumors that harbor a matching molecular alter-
ation, a growing understanding of the impor-
tance of molecular heterogeneity and cellular 
context is emerging. For example, the efficacy of 
the targeted BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib, has 
been shown to be mixed across a diverse set of 
nonmelanoma cancers with a BRAF V600 muta-
tion11 and is well known to have poor efficacy 
in BRAF-mutated colorectal cancers.11,13 Sim-
ilarly, early results from the MyPathway bas-
ket trial have demonstrated variable response 
rates in patients with identical mutations across 
different tumor types.14 Finally, in a phase II 
study in which patients with a specific molecu-
lar alteration were randomly assigned to receive 
treatment with a molecularly targeted agent or 
physician’s choice of treatment, there was no 
difference in median progression-free survival 
between the two treatment groups.12 These 
data suggest that the effectiveness of targeting 
putative driver mutations with molecularly tar-
geted agents may be dependent on the specific 
cellular context or tumor type. Results of larger 
basket trials, including the ASCO TAPUR and 
NCI-MATCH trials, will help to further clar-
ify the effectiveness of this approach and define 
the interplay of genomic alterations and cellular 
context. The importance of cellular context and 
tumor type has also been reported for the man-
agement of liver metastases by using stereotactic 
body radiotherapy. Colorectal adenocarcinoma 
histology has been found to be more radiore-
sistant compared with other tumor types and 
histologies, including anal squamous cell cancer,

 breast adenocarcinoma, and lung adenocarci-
noma.23-25
Results presented here reinforce the continued 
relevance of tumor type diagnosis in optimiz-
ing treatment strategies that can potentially 
affect patient outcomes. Findings from the cur-
rent study compare favorably with other stud-
ies that have used either multiplatform—IHC, 
next-generation sequencing, fluorescence in situ 
hybridization—tumor profiling26 or microarray- 
based tumor classification.27 The most common 
main tumor types predicted by the 92-gene 
assay were pancreaticobiliary (21%), squamous 
cell carcinoma (10%), lung adenocarcinoma 
(8.1%), and intestinal (8.1%), gastric (7.7%), 
and bladder (6.6%) tumors. These tumor types 
are common putative primary sites for CUP,16,28 
but have distinct recommended first-line, 
site-specific systemic therapy approaches. With 
regard to pancreaticobiliary tumors, the 92-gene 
assay also reports additional subtyping into 
gallbladder adenocarcinoma, pancreatic adeno-
carcinoma, or cholangiocarcinoma, which may 
inform treatment decisions for surgery type, 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy, or site-directed and 
targetable agents. In addition, a significant pro-
portion of tumor types predicted by the 92-gene 
assay, including lung adenocarcinoma, lung 
squamous, colorectal, gastroesophageal, urinary 
bladder, and neuroendocrine tumors, have not 
only specific chemotherapy approaches, but also 
US Food and Drug Administration–approved 
 
molecularly targeted therapies or immunothera-
pies. Immunotherapy approaches with checkpoint 
inhibitors have variable response rates depend-
ing on tumor type.29-31 Moreover, programmed 
death ligand-1 biomarker testing can have varying 
cutoffs on the basis of tumor type.32,33 These data 
underscore the continued importance of iden-
tifying tumor type and subtype diagnosis when 
implementing a precision medicine approach 
to optimize therapeutic strategies and patient 
outcomes.
Results from this prospective study are con-
sistent with previous retrospective analyses of 
the 92-gene assay on diagnosis and treatment

 decision making, with similar overall results, 
which supports the clinical utility of the assay.34,35 
Strengths of this study include the large num-
ber of patients and contributing physicians, 
which contributed to the generalizability of the 
study results. Several limitations should be con-
sidered when evaluating the results from this 
study. First, this was an observational study and 
no data on outcomes were collected; however, 
previous studies have demonstrated that the 
use of the 92-gene assay improved survival in 
patients with CUP who were treated on the basis 
of assay results.16,34 Although multiple aspects of 
the study design were prespecified and carefully 
planned, such as study physicians independently 
completing questionnaires, a blinded design such 
 
that the testing laboratory did not have knowl-
edge of working diagnoses, and a preplanned 
statistical analysis, bias is an inherent feature 
of observational studies. Finally, participating 
oncologists and pathologists largely were from 
 
different institutions; thus, interdisciplinary inter-
actions were not evaluated in this study. This 
aspect of the cross-functional integration of 
molecular diagnostic results warrants investiga-
tion in future studies.
This study demonstrated that the 92-gene 
assay affected diagnosis and treatment selection 
in a significant proportion of patients, which 
supports the clinical utility of the assay as a stan-
dardized molecular approach to help streamline 
additional diagnostic testing in patients with 
metastatic cancer with unknown or uncertain 
diagnoses. Use of a tissue-sparing molecular 
assay also may allow for complementary muta-
tional profiling. This approach has been pro-
posed in a diagnostic algorithm that integrates 
standard-of-care IHC, molecular tumor classi-
fication, and comprehensive genomic profiling 
to maximize the clinically meaningful benefit 
in patients with CUP.10 Gene expression–based 
molecular diagnostic assays have also been 
incorporated in clinical practice algorithms for 
patients with CUP.5 Successful implementation 
of an integrated and standardized methodol-
ogy for patients with metastatic cancer with 
unknown or uncertain primary site may result 
in a more comprehensive and effective diagnos-
tic approach for optimized treatment planning, 
including site-specific chemotherapy, molecu-
larly targeted therapy, radiotherapy, eligibility 
for tumor-specific clinical trials, and immuno-
therapies with curative potential for a subset of 
patients with specific tumor types.
