Background: Despite several randomized trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses that have demon-
strated the effectiveness of antimicrobial (triclosan-coated or -impregnated) sutures (TCS), the clini-
cal and economic impact of using these sutures compared with conventional non-antimicrobial-coated
absorbable sutures (NCS) remains poorly documented.
Methods: An independent systematic review and meta-analysis of all published evidence from January
2005 to September 2016 comparing TCS with NCS was conducted. Surgical-site infection (SSI) was
the primary outcome. The results of the meta-analysis were used in a decision-tree deterministic
and stochastic cost model, using the National Health Service (NHS England)-based cost of inpatient
admissions for infections and differential costs of TCS versus NCS.
Results: Thirty-four studies were included in the final assessment from an initial 163 identified citations;
20 of 34 studies were randomized, and 17 of 34 reported blinding of physicians and assessors. Using
a random-effects model, the odds ratio for SSI in the TCS compared with NCS control groups was
statistically significant (odds ratio 0⋅61, 95 per cent c.i. 0⋅52 to 0⋅73; P < 0⋅001). There was significant
heterogeneity (I2 = 49 per cent). Using random-effects event estimates of SSI for TCS and NCS for
each individual wound type, the mean savings per surgical procedure from using antimicrobial sutures
were significant: £91⋅25 (90 per cent c.i. 49⋅62 to 142⋅76) (€105⋅09 (57⋅15 to 164⋅41); exchange rate 15
November 2016) across all wound types.
Conclusion: The reviewed literature suggested that antimicrobial sutures may result in significant
savings across various surgical wound types.

Introduction
Antimicrobial suture technology involves the coating or
impregnation of synthetic, absorbable, polymeric sutures
with the antiseptic, triclosan. Triclosan is a broad-spectrum
antiseptic with excellent activity against Gram-positive
and Gram-negative bacteria, which are typical surgical
pathogens1,
2. Several experimental studies3–5 have shown
that these bacteria are inhibited from adhering to triclosan-
coated or -impregnated sutures together with an antimi-
crobial effect. The safe amount of triclosan required for an
optimal antimicrobial effect is a maximum of 2360 μg/m
in impregnated polydioxanone and coated poliglecaprone
sutures, and 472 μg/m in coated polyglactin sutures6,
7.
These amounts are miniscule compared with the concen-
trations of triclosan encountered from other commercial
or environmental sources; over the past 13 years no Man-
ufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE)
database report on the US Food and Drug Administration
website has indicated any adverse event associated with the
use of triclosan antimicrobial sutures8.
Studies have shown that surgeons cannot differenti-
ate practically the presence or absence of triclosan in
sutures, which makes it possible to design double-blind
RCT
s9,
10. Several RCT
s have reported a reduced incidence
of surgical-site infection (SSI) following use of triclosan-
coated sutures (TCS) compared with non-antimicrobial-
coated sutures (NCS). Subsequent independent systematic
reviews and meta-analyses11–13, involving several thousand
patients, have shown level 1A clinical evidence that the
use of TCS significantly reduces the incidence of SSI, by

approximately 30 per cent. One of these meta-analyses13
ruled out several factors of bias and found that TCS sig-
nificantly reduced SSI, with an overall risk ratio (RR) of
0⋅67 (95 per cent c.i. 0⋅53 to 0⋅84; P < 0⋅001). Results were
also robust to sensitivity analysis and the RR was significant
in all clean, clean-contaminated and contaminated surgery
subgroups.
The burden of SSI after general surgery, particularly
colorectal surgery, has not changed despite the introduc-
tion of guidelines and care bundles14–16. A study17 con-
ducted in English National Health Service (NHS) hospitals
reported an overall SSI incidence rate of 10 per cent, with a
mean attributable excess length of stay (LOS) of more than
9 bed-days per SSI and a directly-related excess cost of over
£3000 (€3450; exchange rate 15 November 2016) per SSI.
Another study18, conducted in a single NHS Trust in Eng-
land, reported an overall SSI incidence of 12⋅8 per cent with
a median excess LOS of 11 bed-days per SSI, and an excess
cost of more than £5000 (€5760; exchange rate 15 Novem-
ber 2016) per SSI. Systematic reviews and meta-analysis
cannot directly calculate the pooled SSI-attributable excess
costs to healthcare. An economic study19, using a decision
analytical model, suggested that converting to TCS could
save substantial hospital costs provided the SSI rate was
reduced by at least 10 per cent and when the risk of SSI
is over 10 per cent. A further model has been constructed
in the present study to estimate the potential health service
and budget impacts following wound closure with TCS or
NCS for NHS (England) as a healthcare provider.
Methods
A systematic review of all evidence available from January
2005 to September 2016, employing the search strategy
shown in Table S1 (supporting information), was conducted
using MEDLINE and Embase, and following PRISMA
guidelines20. All identified publications were reviewed
manually for inclusion in the final list of studies.
Study criteria
T
o be included in the systematic review and meta-analysis,
publications had to meet the Patient, Intervention, Com-
parator, Outcome and Study (PICOS) criteria (Table 1).
Briefly, all peer-reviewed studies comparing TCS with
NCS (control), involving more than 30 patients per arm,
with SSI as a primary outcome, were included. Conference
abstracts were included when the abstract had been pub-
lished in 2015 or 2016. Older conference abstracts were
eliminated as it was assumed that data from these studies
would have been submitted for peer review.

Antibiotic-coated sutures
Comparator
Non-antibiotic-coated sutures – all types of
non-antibiotic-coated comparator were included
Outcome
SSI at any postoperative time point. When more than
one time point was provided, the latest time point
was selected so that one SSI rate per cohort was
included in the final analysis. When sutures were
used at multiple sites, thereby creating a potential
for infections at multiple sites, each site of potential
infection was counted as a unit. Counts of SSIs
thus refer to the sum of individual infection sites
and not the sum of patients with infections
Study type
Comparative studies of any type were included as
long as more than 30 patients were included per
arm. Studies described only in conference
abstracts were included only when less than
2 years old. Care was taken to eliminate duplicate

the second. For all publications, the surgery wound type
was recorded as stated by the authors or defined, based
on the criteria established by the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, as clean, clean-contaminated, or
combined contaminated/dirty wound types. Studies that

SSI outcome per wound type or surgery type, were catego-
rized as undefined. SSI rates were recorded for all groups
and studies. When SSIs were provided at multiple time
points, the latest available time point was recorded. Only
one infection rate per cohort was thereby included in the
analysis and no cohort was represented more than once. All
data points were independent of one another. When multi-
ple infection sites were reported, the total sum of infection
sites (regardless of whether infections were in the same
patient or distinct patients) were included in the analy-
sis, with the unit of analysis being infections, not unique
patients with infections. When distinct SSI rates were pro-
vided for each surgical wound type, these were entered in
the model individually.
Statistical analysis
Odds ratios (ORs) for SSI were the primary outcomes of
interest. The inverse variance method was used to estimate
both fixed-effect and random-effects estimates, with the
DerSimonian–Laird method used for the random-effects
models21,
22. Heterogeneity was assessed using the χ2 test,
and the index of heterogeneity (I2) was calculated using
methods described previously23.
T
o refine further the estimated ORs for SSI, a subanal-
ysis was conducted, analysing each study based on surgical
wound type. For this analysis, studies were grouped
as: multiple wound type (group 0); clean wound type
(group 1); clean-contaminated wound type (group 2);
or contaminated or dirty wound type (group 3). A
meta-regression was also conducted to evaluate whether
each wound type was a predictor of SSI. Model estimates
and 95 per cent confidence intervals are shown. Statistical
significance was set at α = 0⋅05.
Model design
A decision tree was designed, as shown in Fig. 1. Both
deterministic and stochastic models were constructed. The
probabilistic model was built in this study to address the
sensitivity of values taken by key parameters on cost find-
ings. Key variables for each of the tree branches of the
model included: differential cost of TCS compared with
traditional sutures; probability of developing an SSI when
treated with TCS or NCS; and inpatient cost of SSI.
The probability of SSI was evaluated using the data
captured for the meta-analysis, but evaluating rates of SSI
individually for TCS and NCS, and for each wound type.
These rates were used in the cost model.
The differential cost of sutures was estimated by com-
paring the April 2015 list price of traditional sutures with
that of similar TCS (prices were provided by Ethicon,
Somerville, New Jersey, USA). The distribution of cost dif-
ferential was analysed, and the shape of the distribution
and mean were evaluated. Inpatient costs of SSI were based
on analyses of Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) cost data

The search strategy yielded a total of 163 citations. Man-
ual review of all citations was performed and manuscripts
were eliminated if they did not provide original SSI rates in
patients treated with TCS versus control NCS (Fig. 2). After
final review, data from 34 distinct studies were included in
the final assessment, yielding a total of 38 data points

studies compared triclosan-coated sutures (polyglactin or

dioxanone) with non-coated sutures. Coated polyglactin
910
(Vicryl®;
Ethicon),
poliglecaprone (Monocryl®;
Ethicon) and polydioxanone (PDS®; Ethicon) sutures
were control sutures in most studies. One study used Chi-
nese silk as control, another used glyconate (Monosyn®;
B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany), and five studies did not
identify a specific suture but referred to the control simply
as a conventional suture. In the majority of studies, SSI
was defined as by the US Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, and within a 30-day time frame following
surgery58.
Primary outcome analysis
Forest plots for all studies and for each group of studies
are shown in Fig. 3. Across all studies, the random-effects
OR for SSI in the TCS group compared with the NCS
control was 0⋅61 (95 per cent c.i. 0⋅52 to 0⋅73; P < 0⋅001).
However, the studies showed a significant degree of hetero-
geneity (I2 = 49 per cent). Although there was a clear trend
showing an increased OR for SSI in more contaminated/
dirty wounds, the meta-regression did not identify wound
type as a significant predictor of SSI, probably related to
the small sample of studies in the contaminated/dirty cat-
egory. Specifically, using a restricted maximum likelihood
model and the clean cohort as reference, the log of OR for
clean-contaminated and contaminated/dirty was −0⋅219
(95 per cent c.i. −0⋅690 to 0⋅253; P = 0⋅351) and −0⋅585
(−1⋅446 to 0⋅277; P = 0⋅176).
Cost analysis
Assuming a relative frequency of clean, clean-contaminated
and dirty wound categories as described in the HES public
data for 2015, mean savings per operation ranged from
£56⋅59 (90 per cent c.i. 17⋅20 to 104⋅93) (€65⋅23 (19⋅83
to 120⋅87); exchange rate 15 November 2016) for clean
wound procedures to £248⋅23 (62⋅71 to 470⋅45) (€285⋅93
(72⋅24 to 541⋅91); exchange rate 15 November 2016) for
contaminated/dirty wound operations, with overall sav-
ings per operation estimated at £91⋅25 (49⋅62 to 142⋅76)
(€105⋅09 (57⋅15 to 164⋅41); exchange rate 15 November
2016).

Overall per-procedure savings followed a γ distribution

are shown in the tornado chart (Fig. 5). Inpatient cost
variability for SSI had the greatest impact on total savings.
Discussion
This systematic review included RCT
s as well as large,
well designed, cohort and retrospective database analyses
that provided a real-world estimate of SSI in non-study
settings52. The findings thus reflect a comprehensive
overview of both RCT
s and well designed epidemiological
studies. In addition, the most recent NHS cost data were
used to evaluate the impact of TCS on total cost of care.
The evidence of efficacy from several independent sys-
tematic reviews and meta-analyses, and the healthcare
resources savings predicted by the decision-tree determin-
istic and stochastic cost model used in this study, suggest
that antimicrobial sutures could be included in SSI sur-
gical care bundles, which have been shown to reduce the
risk of SSI16,
59. The articles reviewed for this economic
analysis model were more inclusive than those in earlier
meta-analyses11–13 and with a less prescriptive standard.
Although the evidence from one of these meta-analyses
showed a clear benefit of reduction of SSIs after all classes
of surgery (clean to contaminated), with little evidence of
publication bias, and robustness to sensitivity analysis13, no
doubt more RCT
s will continue to be published. RCT
s, sys-
tematic reviews and meta-analyses generally do not address
healthcare costs; the present study therefore focused on
the economic benefits of this innovative suture technology
to improve patient outcomes. The UK National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)60 and the US
Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Commit-
tee (HICPAC)58 do not yet recommend the use of TCS for
the prevention of SSI. The evidence that triclosan could be
hazardous has been refuted6,
7, and this should not present a
barrier to its use, particularly as the extra cost is more than
compensated for by the economic benefit.
The difficulty of accurately and consistently defining the
primary outcome of SSI with adequate, ideally independent
and blinded, postoperative (and postdischarge) surveillance
has to be addressed15,
61,
62. Equally, the stubborn resistance
of SSI rates to fall, and SSI becoming the commonest
healthcare-associated infection, must relate to the ade-
quacy of compliance with agreed care bundles. Some of
these difficulties are exemplified by the PROUD study27.
This randomized multicentre study, which took several
months to complete, was likely to have been underpowered
to show a statistically significant reduction in deep SSI, and
antimicrobial sutures (specifically triclosan-impregnated
polydioxanone) were used solely in the musculofascial
layers of abdominal closure. The authors documented a
reduction in SSI in the TCS groups, but the reduction
did not reach statistical significance. Triclosan-coated
poliglecaprone or polyglactin sutures were not used to
close skin or subcutaneous layers; clips were used for skin
closure. Clips are prone to later exogenous SSI, so how
could superficial incisional SSI be expected to be pre-
vented from sutures placed in much deeper layers? Wound
contamination following colorectal surgery often involves
both deep and superficial incisional sites. Therefore, to
maximize benefit from antimicrobial sutures, they should
be used for both superficial and deep musculofascial layers.
The number of surgeons involved in closing the abdominal
wall may well have influenced the outcome, as fascial and
subcuticular closure is often delegated to more junior
members of the surgical staff. However, this study and a
previous meta-analysis13 have confirmed that the overall
relative risk of SSI across all groups is still favourable for
coated sutures versus non-coated sutures.
The decision-tree deterministic and stochastic economic
cost model used in this study found that the use of antimi-
crobial sutures results in a significant cost saving for all sur-
gical wound types. Several earlier publications29,
63,
64 have
alluded to the benefits to healthcare of using antimicro-
bial sutures, but none used a more accurate, economic cost
model such as that in the present study. Triclosan antimi-
crobial sutures should be considered for superficial and
deep layer closure after all surgical operations.
