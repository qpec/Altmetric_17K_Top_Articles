BACKGROUND
High-flow oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula has been increasingly used in 
infants with bronchiolitis, despite limited high-quality evidence of its efficacy. The 
efficacy of high-flow oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula in settings other 
than intensive care units (ICUs) is unclear.
METHODS
In this multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, we assigned infants younger 
than 12 months of age who had bronchiolitis and a need for supplemental oxygen 
therapy to receive either high-flow oxygen therapy (high-flow group) or standard 
oxygen therapy (standard-therapy group). Infants in the standard-therapy group 
could receive rescue high-flow oxygen therapy if their condition met criteria for 
treatment failure. The primary outcome was escalation of care due to treatment 
failure (defined as meeting ≥3 of 4 clinical criteria: persistent tachycardia, tachy-
pnea, hypoxemia, and medical review triggered by a hospital early-warning tool). 
Secondary outcomes included duration of hospital stay, duration of oxygen therapy, 
and rates of transfer to a tertiary hospital, ICU admission, intubation, and adverse 
events.
RESULTS
The analyses included 1472 patients. The percentage of infants receiving escalation 
of care was 12% (87 of 739 infants) in the high-flow group, as compared with 23% 
(167 of 733) in the standard-therapy group (risk difference, −11 percentage points; 
95% confidence interval, −15 to −7; P<0.001). No significant differences were ob-
served in the duration of hospital stay or the duration of oxygen therapy. In each 
group, one case of pneumothorax (<1% of infants) occurred. Among the 167 in-
fants in the standard-therapy group who had treatment failure, 102 (61%) had a 
response to high-flow rescue therapy.
CONCLUSIONS
Among infants with bronchiolitis who were treated outside an ICU, those who 
received high-flow oxygen therapy had significantly lower rates of escalation of 
care due to treatment failure than those in the group that received standard 
oxygen therapy. (Funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
B
ronchiolitis, an acute lower airway 
lung disease that is generally caused by re-
spiratory viruses, is the most common rea-
son worldwide for nonelective hospital admission 
in infants. In the United States, bronchiolitis is 
responsible for $1.7 billion in hospitalization costs 
annually.1,2 In Australia and New Zealand, there 
has been a population-based increase in admis-
sions to the intensive care unit (ICU) for bron-
chiolitis, with associated increases in hospital 
costs.3
Numerous studies have investigated the role of 
medical therapies4 in infants with bronchiolitis; 
none of these interventions have shown efficacy.5 
The American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines 
recommend only supportive therapy that includes 
oxygen therapy for hypoxemia, respiratory sup-
port, and the maintenance of hydration.5,6
Respiratory support as provided in emergency 
and ward settings has been limited to oxygen 
delivered through a standard nasal cannula, at a 
rate of up to 2 liters of 100% oxygen per minute, 
to treat hypoxemia.7 The hallmark of severe 
bronchiolitis is small airway inflammation re-
sulting in hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and increased 
work of breathing,1 all of which respond to the 
provision of positive pressure. However, respira-
tory support involving continuous positive air-
way pressure, intubation, and mechanical venti-
lation8-10 has traditionally been restricted to the 
intensive care setting.
High-flow oxygen therapy through a nasal 
cannula has emerged as a new method to pro-
vide respiratory support for respiratory diseases 
in neonates, infants, children, and adults.11-13 
Humidified and heated air that is blended with 
oxygen and delivered through a nasal cannula 
provides a degree of positive airway pressure.14,15 
Observational and physiological studies suggest 
that decreased work of breathing,16 improved 
oxygenation, and reduced rates of intubation are 
associated with high-flow oxygen therapy.17,18 We 
conducted a multicenter, randomized trial to test 
whether early treatment with high-flow therapy 
in infants with bronchiolitis and hypoxemia in 
emergency departments and general pediatric 
wards would result in fewer infants having 
treatment failure that leads to the escalation 
of care.
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
Emergency departments and general pediatric 
inpatient units in 17 tertiary and regional hospi-
tals in Australia and New Zealand participated 
in the trial. The human research ethics commit-
tee at each participating site approved the trial. 
The protocol, available with the full text of this 
article at NEJM.org, has been published previous-
ly.19 The trial was overseen by a steering commit-
tee with a principal investigator at each site. The 
authors vouch for the accuracy and complete-
ness of the data and for the fidelity of the trial 
to the protocol. The first drafts of the manu-
script were written by the first and last authors 
with input from all the authors. Although the 
intervention could not be masked, all the inves-
tigators remained unaware of the trial outcome 
until all the data were locked at the end of trial 
in December 2016, after the analysis of data 
from all recruited patients. The high-flow equip-
ment and consumables for all the trial sites were 
donated by Fisher and Paykel Healthcare, which 
had no involvement in the design and conduct 
of the trial, the analysis of the data, or in the 
preparation of the manuscript or the decision to 
submit it for publication.
Patients
Infants younger than 12 months of age were 
eligible for inclusion on presentation to an emer-
gency department or inpatient unit if they had 
clinical signs of bronchiolitis and a need for 
supplemental oxygen therapy to keep the oxygen-
saturation level in the range of 92 to 98% (or 94 
to 98% at the 11 hospitals with higher satura-
tion thresholds for intervention in hypoxemia, 
in alignment with their institutional practice). 
Bronchiolitis in an infant was defined according 
to the American Academy of Pediatrics20 criteria as 
symptoms of respiratory distress associated with 
symptoms of a viral respiratory tract infection.5 
We excluded critically ill infants who had an im-
mediate need for respiratory support and ICU 
admission; infants with cyanotic heart disease, 
basal skull fracture, upper airway obstruction, 
or craniofacial malformation; and infants who 
were receiving oxygen therapy at home.

High-Flow Oxygen in Infants with Bronchiolitis
Written informed consent was obtained from 
all the parents or guardians with the use of 
either an immediate (prospective) or a deferred 
(retrospective) consent process (see Section 4.3 in 
the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM 
.org). At the time of the trial, high-flow therapy 
was considered to be the normal standard prac-
tice in the trial centers; therefore, the ethics com-
mittee allowed the deferred-consent process.
Randomization
A computer-generated randomization sequence 
with a block size of 10 was used, and infants 
were stratified according to participating center. 
Sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes 
containing the treatment assignment (in a 1:1 
ratio) were opened when eligibility criteria were 
met. Masking of the assigned treatment was not 
possible, given the visually obvious differences 
between the two interventions.
Trial Interventions
Infants in the high-flow group received heated 
and humidified high-flow oxygen at a rate of 
2 liters per kilogram of body weight per minute, 
delivered by the Optiflow system with the use of 
an age-appropriate Optiflow Junior cannula and 
the Airvo 2 high-flow system (Fisher and Paykel 
Healthcare). The fraction of inspired oxygen 
(Fio2) for high-flow use was adjusted to obtain 
oxygen-saturation levels in the range of 92 to 
98% (or 94 to 98% at the 11 hospitals with 
higher saturation thresholds). Weaning of the 
Fio2 to the level of ambient air (0.21) was permit-
ted at any time to provide the lowest possible 
oxygen percentage to maintain an oxygen-satu-
ration level of at least 92% (or ≥94% in the 11 
specified hospitals). High-flow oxygen therapy 
was stopped after 4 hours of receiving an Fio2 of 
0.21 while oxygen levels were maintained in the 
expected range.
Infants in the standard-therapy group received 
supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula, 
up to a maximum of 2 liters per minute, to main-
tain an oxygen-saturation level in the range of 
92 to 98% (or 94 to 98%, depending on institu-
tional practice). Weaning from supplemental 
oxygen was permitted at any time to provide the 
lowest possible oxygen level delivered to main-
tain an oxygen-saturation level of at least 92% 
(or ≥94%).
Enteral feeding was recommended, depending 
on the clinician’s preference. Oral intake of food 
(liquid or solid) was allowed, particularly during 
weaning from the treatment.
Trial Outcomes
The primary outcome was treatment failure that 
resulted in escalation of care during that hospi-
tal admission. At the point of care, the treating 
clinicians determined the presence of treatment 
failure if at least three of four clinical criteria 
were met and clinicians decided that escalation 
of care was required. The criteria were as follows: 
the heart rate remained unchanged or increased 
by any amount since admission (by contrast, a 
decrease of >5 beats per minute or into the nor-
mal range indicated treatment success); the re-
spiratory rate remained unchanged or increased 
by any amount since admission (by contrast, a 
decrease of >5 breaths per minute or into the 
normal range indicated treatment success); the 
oxygen requirement in the high-flow group 
exceeded an Fio2 of at least 0.4 to maintain an 
oxygen-saturation level of at least 92% (or ≥94%, 
depending on the institution) or the requirement 
for supplemental oxygen in the standard-therapy 
group exceeded 2 liters per minute to maintain 
an oxygen-saturation level of at least 92% (or 
≥94%); and the hospital internal early-warning 
tool triggered a medical review and escalation of 
care (see below). Clinicians were allowed to es-
calate therapy if they were concerned for other 
clinical reasons that were not captured in the 
four clinical criteria.
All the participating hospitals used an early-
warning tool to trigger escalation of care, with 
11 of the 17 centers using an identical scoring 
system and 6 using comparable systems (see Sec-
tion 4.14 in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
early-warning tools were all based on multiple 
physiological and clinical variables that mandated 
medical review and escalation of care when lim-
its were breached. Escalation of treatment or the 
level of care was defined as an increase in respi-
ratory support or transfer to an ICU. For infants 
in the standard-therapy group who received es-
calation of care, it was suggested to change to

high-flow therapy in the inpatient environment 
at the discretion of the clinician.
Prespecified secondary outcomes included the 
proportion of infants who were transferred to an 
ICU, which included admission to an on-site ICU 
or transfer to an ICU at a tertiary hospital; the 
duration of hospital stay; the duration of ICU 
stay; the duration of oxygen therapy; intubation 
rates; and adverse events. Data regarding treat-
ment that was not specified as part of the trial 
were recorded, as were data regarding medica-
tions. The nine centers that had no on-site ICU 
had to transport infants who required intensive 
care to a hospital that provided these pediatric 
services. A serious adverse event was defined as 
any event that was fatal, life-threatening, perma-
nently disabling, or incapacitating or that resulted 
in a prolonged hospital stay.
Statistical Analysis
Assuming a baseline rate of treatment failure of 
10% in the standard-therapy group and a 50% 
lower rate (5%) in the high-flow group, we cal-
culated that 582 infants per group would provide 
the trial with 90% power at a type I error of 0.05 
to show a rate of treatment failure that was sig-
nificantly lower with high-flow therapy than with 
standard therapy (see Section 4.4 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Assuming a rate of with-
drawal or loss to follow-up of approximately 10 to 
20%, we calculated an overall sample size of 1400. 
The primary and secondary outcomes were ana-
lyzed on the basis of the assigned treatment 
group.
Data were analyzed first for all infants who 
received escalation of care. Data were then ana-
lyzed again for all infants who received escala-
tion of care and for whom secondary chart re-
view independently confirmed that at least three 
of the four clinical criteria for treatment failure 
had been met. Descriptive statistics were used to 
report the baseline characteristics of the total 
trial cohort, according to treatment group. The 
primary outcome measure for the investigation 
of the escalation of care due to treatment failure 
was analyzed with the use of a chi-square test 
and was reported as the relative risk and the risk 
difference with 95% confidence intervals and 
P values. The continuous outcome measure of 
the duration of hospital stay was approximately 
normally distributed; hence, Student’s t-test of 
independent samples was used. Analyses of sec-
ondary outcomes were based on the chi-square 
test for proportions and on Student’s t-tests of 
independent samples for continuous measures.
Prespecified subgroups included infants who 
had been born prematurely (at <37 weeks of ges-
tation), infants with a previous hospital admission 
for respiratory disease, infants with a congenital 
heart defect, infants younger than 3 months of 
age and those younger than 6 months of age 
(with correction for prematurity), and infants 
presenting to hospitals with an on-site ICU and 
those without an on-site ICU. A test for interac-
tion between treatment group and subgroup on 
the basis of a log binomial regression model was 
used to test for homogeneity of relative risks 
between subgroups. If there was no evidence of 
heterogeneity in a subgroup analysis, the overall 
relative risk was assumed for that subgroup. 
Exploratory analyses involved patients who re-
ceived escalation of care.
Results
Characteristics of the Patients
Infants were recruited between October 2013 
and August 2016. A total of 2217 infants were 
eligible for inclusion, of whom 1638 (74%) un-
derwent randomization (Fig. 1). A total of 210 
parents or guardians (12%) declined consent 
(166 with deferred consent and 44 with immedi-
ate consent); thus, 1472 infants were included in 
the analyses. The baseline demographic and 
physiological characteristics of the infants were 
similar in the two groups (Table 1, and Table 
S1A and S1B in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most 
common virus detected, and premature birth 
was the most common coexisting condition.
Primary Outcome
Treatment failure with escalation of care oc-
curred in 87 of 739 infants (12%) in the high-
flow group, as compared with 167 of 733 (23%) 
in the standard-therapy group (risk difference, 
−11 percentage points; 95% confidence interval 
[CI], −15 to −7; P<0.001). The Kaplan–Meier plot 
showed a higher rate of treatment success among 
infants treated with high-flow oxygen therapy 
than among those who received standard oxygen 
therapy, and a log-rank test confirmed a lower

hazard of treatment failure in the high-flow 
group (P<0.001) (Fig. 2). Among infants who 
had treatment failure, the interval between en-
rollment and escalation of care did not differ 
significantly between the two groups (Table 2). 
The number needed to treat to prevent one 
 
instance of escalation of care was 9 (95% CI, 
7 to 14).
The effect of the intervention on escalation 
of care was independent of age. The treatment 
effect of the intervention differed significantly 
between hospitals with an on-site ICU and those 
without an on-site ICU (P<0.001). In hospitals 
without an on-site ICU, escalation of care oc-
curred in 20 of 270 infants (7%) in the high-flow 
group, as compared with 69 of 247 (28%) in the 
standard-therapy group (risk difference, −21 per-
centage points; 95% CI, −27 to −14). However, in 
hospitals with an on-site ICU, escalation of care 
occurred in 67 of 469 (14%) in the high-flow 
group and in 98 of 486 (20%) in the standard-
therapy group (risk difference, −6 percentage 
points; 95% CI, −11 to −1). Analyses that consid-
ered a history of prematurity or previous hospi-
tal admission showed no effect on the primary 
outcome. There were no significant differences 
in outcome between RSV-positive infants and 
RSV-negative infants.
The results were similar in all the infants 
receiving escalation of care who were indepen-
dently confirmed to meet at least three of the 
four clinical criteria for treatment failure (Ta-
ble 2, and Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). According to independent chart review, 
clinicians escalated therapy in 86 of 254 infants 
(34%; 34 infants in the high-flow group and 
52 in the standard-therapy group) who did not 
meet three of the four prespecified clinical cri-
teria. A total of 53 infants in the high-flow 
group (7%) met this threshold and received 
escalation of care, as compared with 115 (16%) 
in the standard-therapy group (risk difference, −9 
percentage points; 95% CI, −12 to −5; P<0.001) 
(Table 2). The severity of disease as measured 
immediately before the time of escalation of 
care was similar in the two trial groups with 
regard to the absolute heart rate and the trans-
cutaneous oxygen saturation level; however, the 
respiratory rate was significantly higher in the 
high-flow group than in the standard-therapy 
group (Table 3). The most common reason that 
triggered escalation of care was the hospital 
early-warning tool. The proportion of infants 
meeting the clinical criteria triggering escala-
tion of care was similar in hospitals with an 
on-site ICU and in those without an on-site ICU

Infants younger than 12 months of age who had respiratory illness were 
screened for eligibility in the participating hospitals. Informed consent was 
obtained from parents or guardians with the use of either an immediate 
(prospective) or a deferred (retrospective) consent process. At the time  
of the trial, high-flow therapy was considered to be the normal standard 
practice in the trial centers, so the ethics committee allowed the deferred-
consent process.

High-Flow Oxygen in Infants with Bronchiolitis
(Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). There 
were no primary-outcome differences in the 
subgroups (Table S3 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).
Secondary Outcomes
There were no significant between-group differ-
ences in the duration of hospital stay, the dura-
tion of stay in the ICU, or the duration of oxygen 
therapy (Table 3, and Fig. S2A and S2B in the 
Supplementary Appendix). In all 167 infants in 
the standard-therapy group who had treatment 
failure and received escalation of care, clinicians 
opted to offer high-flow therapy as a rescue 
treatment. Among these 167 infants, 102 (61%) 
had a response to high-flow rescue therapy; in 
65 infants (39%), rescue high-flow therapy was 
ineffective, and the infants were transferred to 
an ICU. Overall, 35 infants (2%) were transferred 
from a hospital without an on-site ICU to an-
other hospital. A total of 12 infants (1%) under-
went intubation, including 8 infants in the high-
flow group and 4 in the standard-therapy group 
(P 
= 
0.39). Data regarding medications are pro-
vided in Table S4 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix. The rate of adverse events was low in each 
group, with one pneumothorax occurring in 
each group (no drainage needed). No life-threat-
ening serious adverse events were observed, in-
cluding no instances of emergency intubation or 
cardiac arrest.
Discussion
In this multicenter, randomized, controlled trial 
involving infants with bronchiolitis and hypox-
emia, we found that significantly fewer infants 
in the high-flow group than in the standard-
therapy group received escalation of care. There 
was no significant between-group difference in 
the incidence of adverse events. There was no 
evidence of a shorter duration of oxygen therapy, 
lower rate of ICU admission, or shorter duration 
of hospital stay in infants receiving high-flow 
oxygen therapy than in those receiving standard 
subnasal oxygen therapy.
Our findings are supported by the results of 
a recent smaller trial,21 which showed a similar 
effect size, with a lower treatment-failure rate in 
the high-flow group than in the standard-therapy 
group (14% vs. 33%). No significant differences 
in the duration of oxygen therapy and the dura-
tion of hospital stay were found in that trial. As 
in our trial, clinicians were allowed to use res-
cue high-flow oxygen therapy for infants in the 
standard-therapy group if they had treatment 
failure. Oxygen-saturation levels of less than 
90% were an exclusion criterion. In contrast, our 
trial specifically targeted infants with hypox-
emia and bronchiolitis, and we excluded infants 
with acutely life-threatening bronchiolitis lead-
ing to immediate respiratory support and intu-

The primary outcome in our pragmatic trial 
included escalation of care and the meeting of at 
least three of four clinical criteria. Escalation of 
care was allowed if clinically warranted in the 
judgment of the treating clinician; this was nec-
essary as a safeguard, given that our trial tested 
an intervention that had been previously per-
formed only in ICUs. Clinicians escalated care in 
34% of the infants who did not meet at least 
three of the four prespecified clinical criteria, 
according to the independent chart review we 
conducted. This relatively high percentage indi-
cates that the selected clinical criteria may not 
comprehensively cover the clinical decision pro-

High-Flow Oxygen in Infants with Bronchiolitis
cess and suggests that other elements in clinical 
judgment were not captured in this trial when 
escalation of care occurred. However, the rela-
tive effect size was similar in analyses involving 
all infants receiving escalation of care and in 
those involving infants receiving escalation of 
care in the presence of at least three of the four 
prespecified clinical criteria. Considering that 
the trial was not blinded and that a similar pro-
portion of infants in each group met the clinical 
criteria, we conclude that there was unlikely to 
be a major bias due to variation in judgment 
among the attending clinicians.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
who had escalation of care to high-flow therapy 
in a general pediatric inpatient ward, including 
65 (39%) who had treatment failure with rescue 
high-flow therapy, were admitted to a pediatric 
ICU. The trial protocol did not offer any “rescue” 
option in the general inpatient unit for infants 
who had treatment failure with high-flow ther-
apy; these infants were all admitted directly to a 
pediatric ICU. The overall rate of ICU admissions 
was lower than rates in a previous report2; only 
1% of the patients in our trial underwent intuba-
tion (Table 3).
Our study had certain limitations. It was not 
possible to mask the oxygen-delivery method. To 
minimize bias, we used prespecified clinical 
criteria for the escalation of care. This pragmatic 
design reflects current practice across many insti-
tutions. The rescue use of high-flow oxygen 
therapy reflected a real-world scenario, because 
high-flow therapy was used as standard practice 
in Australia and New Zealand at the time of our 
trial. Denying clinicians the option to use res-
cue high-flow oxygen therapy in infants in the 
standard-oxygen group would have prevented us 
from performing the trial.
In conclusion, our randomized, controlled 
trial involving infants with bronchiolitis showed 
a significantly lower rate of escalation of care due 
to treatment failure when high-flow oxygen ther-
apy was used early during the hospital admission 
than when standard oxygen therapy was used.
