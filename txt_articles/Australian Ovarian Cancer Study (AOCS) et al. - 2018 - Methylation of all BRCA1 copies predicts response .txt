Methylation of all BRCA1 copies predicts response
to the PARP inhibitor rucaparib in ovarian
carcinoma
Olga Kondrashova1,2, Monique Topp et al.#
Accurately identifying patients with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) who
respond to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) therapy is of great clinical
importance. Here we show that quantitative BRCA1 methylation analysis provides new insight
into PARPi response in preclinical models and ovarian cancer patients. The response of 12
HGSOC patient-derived xenografts (PDX) to the PARPi rucaparib was assessed, with variable
dose-dependent responses observed in chemo-naive BRCA1/2-mutated PDX, and no
responses in PDX lacking DNA repair pathway defects. Among BRCA1-methylated PDX,
silencing of all BRCA1 copies predicts rucaparib response, whilst heterozygous methylation is
associated with resistance. Analysis of 21 BRCA1-methylated platinum-sensitive recurrent
HGSOC (ARIEL2 Part 1 trial) confirmed that homozygous or hemizygous BRCA1 methylation
predicts rucaparib clinical response, and that methylation loss can occur after exposure to
chemotherapy. Accordingly, quantitative BRCA1 methylation analysis in a pre-treatment
biopsy could allow identification of patients most likely to benefit, and facilitate tailoring of
PARPi therapy.

1234567890():,;
 T
he development of therapy with poly(ADP-ribose) poly-
merase inhibitors (PARPi) has been a major advance in
the
treatment
of
high-grade
serous
ovarian
carci-
noma (HGSOC). PARPi are efficacious in HGSOCs with defec-
tive DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR) due to
mutation in the breast and ovarian cancer predisposition genes
BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA1/2)1. When administered as main-
tenance therapy in the setting of platinum-sensitive relapsed
HGSOC, PARPi prolong progression-free survival (PFS), with
some patients deriving durable benefit for more than 3 years2–6.
As a result, PARPi are now approved in both the treatment and
maintenance settings in relapsed ovarian cancer (OC) by the
European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).
PARPi may also be relevant as targeted therapy for cancers
with a range of defects in HR DNA repair beyond BRCA1/2
mutation. In high-grade OC, HR defects caused by BRCA1/2
mutations are present in 17–25% of cases, of which approxi-
mately ¾ are germline and ¼ are somatic7–9. Other HR pathway
alterations have been documented in an additional 25% of
HGSOC7,9. These HR defects include mutations in the HR
pathway genes RAD51C, RAD51D, and PALB2 (6–10%)7,9,10, as
well as methylation of BRCA1 (7–17%)7,11,12 or RAD51C
(1.5–3%) promoters11,13, which is generally mutually exclusive of
BRCA1/2 mutation7,9,10.
Despite exciting clinical efficacy, one third of the patients with
BRCA1/2 mutant relapsed HGSOC fail to derive benefit from
PARPi, with a higher failure rate observed with increasing pla-
tinum resistance. Even when patients do respond, the majority
relapse within 12 months3. A well-defined PARPi resistance
mechanism is restoration of HR function via secondary somatic
mutations occurring within mutated BRCA1/2 genes, resulting in
re-institution of in-frame gene transcription14,15. Secondary
mutations that revert primary BRCA1/2 and RAD51C/D muta-
tions have been described in HGSOC and prostate cancers in
association
with
resistance
to
both
platinum
and
PARPi
therapy10,16,17. Improved understanding of HR defects beyond
BRCA1/2 mutations (both primary or secondary) is still required
to allow more accurate targeting of PARPi therapy and design of
strategies to abrogate PARPi resistance.
BRCA1 promoter methylation was first noted 20 years ago in
breast cancer18, followed by reports in OC19–22. Methylation of
CpG sites close to the BRCA1 transcription start site23,24 is
associated with reduced BRCA1 mRNA and protein7,13,21,23.
Accordingly, one of the accepted mechanisms for functional
BRCA1 loss involves methylation of one BRCA1 allele combined
with a loss of heterozygosity (LOH) event resulting in loss of the
other BRCA1 allele21. The impact of methylation of a single
BRCA1 copy, with retention or demethylation of another, on
response to treatment remains unexplored. In support of BRCA1
methylation conferring an HR defect, it has been associated with
the same gene expression signature and copy number alterations
observed in BRCA1-mutated HGSOC25 and, more recently, with
genomic signatures suggesting HR deficiency in breast cancer26.
Contrary to these observations, unlike for BRCA1/2 mutations,
BRCA1 methylation has not been shown to impact survival in
patients with OC, with multiple studies failing to observe a sig-
nificant improvement in overall survival upon stratification by
BRCA1 methylation status7,11,27,28. More recently in a clinical
trial in triple-negative breast cancer, no benefit was observed for
carboplatin in subjects with tumor-associated BRCA1 methyla-
tion, compared with BRCA1/2 mutation29. Further study of
BRCA1 methylation is required to reconcile these observations.
Use of PARPi therapy was previously proposed for cancers
with BRCA1 methylation30. A BRCA1-methylated breast cancer
cell line displayed PARPi sensitivity; and BRCA1 silencing as well
as PARPi sensitivity were abolished by the demethylating agent 5-
azacytidine31. BRCA1 methylation was also weakly associated
with response to monotherapy with the PARPi rucaparib in the
ARIEL2 Part 1 trial, but it was unclear which BRCA1-methylated
cases would respond to treatment32. In contrast, in a study of
long-term responders following maintenance therapy with PARPi
after response to platinum, no long-term responders (>2 years)
were found to have BRCA1 methylation in their archival
HGSOC33. Thus, the likelihood of PARPi response in patients
with BRCA1-methylated HGSOC requires clarification.
Variable levels of BRCA1 promoter methylation, ranging from
5 to 100%, have been previously reported in breast and OC
samples, with most studies assigning “methylation” status to
samples when as little as 5–15% methylation is detected13,25,27,33.
In some cases, this is consistent with low neoplastic cellularity.
However, the possibility that methylation of all BRCA1 copies
might be required to impact therapeutic outcome has not yet
been addressed. Here we test the hypothesis that the zygosity
status of BRCA1 methylation (homozygous or hemizygous vs.
heterozygous) may have an impact on PARPi or platinum
response and may be affected by treatment pressure, allowing for
the rapid development of drug resistance. The terms “homo-
zygous” and “homozygosity” used to define the methylation sta-
tus in this paper will cover all cases where unmethylated alleles
are absent, regardless of the BRCA1 copy number (Supplementary
Fig. 1). Here we show that the rucaparib response of BRCA1-
methylated OC cell lines and patient-derived xenografts (PDX)
depends upon the BRCA1 methylation zygosity. Further, we
report quantitative methylation analysis of pre-treatment HGSOC
samples from the ARIEL2 Part 1 PARPi trial, which is the only
published clinical trial to date for which pre-treatment biopsies of
cases documented to contain BRCA1 methylation are available. In
this clinical trial setting, we also demonstrate that BRCA1
methylation zygosity correlates with rucaparib response.
Results
Genomic characterization of HGSOC PDX. For this study, we
have characterized PDX from 12 HGSOC patients, ten who were
chemotherapy naive and two who had received multiple prior
lines of therapy. Histologic assessment and WT1, PAX8, and p53
immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining confirmed that the PDX
retained HGSOC features that were observed in the baseline
carcinoma (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 2)34. The patient HGSOC
and/or PDX whole tumor DNA samples were profiled using the
Foundation Medicine T5a next-generation sequencing (NGS)-
based test and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). In addition, each
PDX was also capture-sequenced for mutations in DNA repair
pathway genes, in particular mutations that could cause HR
deficiency, as previously described9, and tested for BRCA1 pro-
moter methylation. Apart from the expected somatic mutations
in TP5335, mutations were also identified in BRCA1/2 in four
HGSOC, one of which was confirmed to be germline (#56;
Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 3a, Supplementary Data 1). Other
events that are commonly detected in HGSOC included RB1
mutation or deletion in six cases (#56, 19, 11, 169, 27, 80), NF1
deletion in one case (#80), and CCNE1 amplification in two cases
(#29, 201). RNA-seq analysis, performed on the baseline patient
HGSOC samples used to generate the PDX, confirmed the
reduced expression of deleted genes and high expression of
amplified genes (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 3b). In addition to
deleterious
BRCA1/2
mutations
in
four
HGSOC,
BRCA1
methylation was detected in four of the 12 HGSOC and in the
corresponding PDX (#11, 62, 48, 169)34. The remaining four PDX
were assigned an HR-DNA repair gene wild-type status, since no
pathogenic mutations were detected in a curated set of HR
pathway genes (Fig. 1b).

 Dose-dependent rucaparib responses in BRCA1/2 mutant
PDX. To assess PARPi sensitivity, rucaparib was delivered by
oral gavage 5 days a week for 3 weeks at one of the three dose
levels—150, 300, or 450 mg kg−1. As expected, three of four
PDX that were HR deficient due to BRCA1/2 mutations
responded to rucaparib in vivo (Table 1, Supplementary Data 2).
Some mice bearing PDX #19 or #56 obtained durable regres-
sions lasting more than 80 days (Fig. 2a, b). Despite being tested
in the chemo-naive/first-line setting, without prior exposure to
chemotherapy or PARPi, variable dose-dependent responses
were observed, and not all BRCA1/2 mutant HGSOC PDX were
equally sensitive to PARPi (Table 1, Fig. 2a, b, Supplementary
Fig. 4a, b).
Two of four BRCA1/2 mutant PDX responded to the lowest dose
of rucaparib tested: BRCA2 mutant PDX #19 (median time to
harvest (TTH) 74 days vs. vehicle 22 days, p = 0.012, log-rank test,
n = 4, 21) and BRCA1 mutant PDX #56 (median TTH 67 days vs.
vehicle 15 days, p = 0.003, log-rank test, n = 5, 16) at 150 mg kg−1.
The chemo-naive BRCA2 mutant PDX #13 had a statistically
significant response to both 300 and 450 mg kg−1 rucaparib, with
median TTH of 81 days for rucaparib 300 mg kg−1 vs. 43 days for
vehicle (p = 0.01, log-rank test, n = 9, 22), although regressions
were not observed. Strikingly, PDX #54, with a pathogenic missense
BRCA1 BRCT domain mutation (c.5095C>T, p.R1699W), was
refractory to rucaparib in the first-line setting (median TTH for
rucaparib 300 mg kg−1 36 days vs. vehicle 32 days, p = 0.9, log-rank
test, n = 9, 4), possibly due to HSP90-mediated stabilization of the
mutant BRCA1 protein, as has been observed with other BRCT
domain-mutant BRCA1 proteins36. In further experiments, DNA
sequencing failed to detect any secondary mutations in either
BRCA1 or BRCA2 in these four PDX at recurrence (Supplementary
Data 3).

 Variable rucaparib responses in PDX with BRCA1 methyla-
tion. In keeping with the proposed requirement of an HR defect
for PARPi response, the four PDX derived from HGSOC lacking
mutation of HR genes and BRCA1 promoter methylation showed
no evidence of tumor regression or disease stabilization with
rucaparib (Table 1, Fig. 2c, d, Supplementary Fig. 4c, d). In con-
trast, variable rucaparib responses were observed in models with
BRCA1 methylation. Two chemo-naive baseline patient HGSOC
samples and the corresponding PDX (#11 and #62), in which no
pathogenic HR gene mutations were detected, were found to
harbor BRCA1 methylation by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) as
previously reported (Fig. 1b)34. Furthermore, two baseline patient
HGSOC samples obtained from patients who had received prior
treatment in the clinic and their corresponding PDX (#48 and
#169) were also found to harbor BRCA1 methylation by MSP. No
other pathogenic events in HR pathway genes were identified in
these four HGSOC or corresponding PDX (Fig. 1b).
The methylation status of these PDX samples was re-assessed
by both methylation-specific high-resolution melting (MS-HRM)
and methylation-sensitive droplet digital PCR (MS-ddPCR).
Seven co-methylated CpG sites of the BRCA1 promoter region
were assessed; MS-HRM (−37, −29, −21, and −19)37 and
ddPCR (+14, +16, and +19). Two modes of BRCA1 methylation
were observed, with (i) homozygous methylation on all BRCA1
copies present and (ii) heterozygous methylation where both
methylated and unmethylated copies were observed (Fig. 3a, b,
Supplementary Figs. 1 and 5). The two chemo-naive PDX (#11
and #62) were consistently found to harbor ~100% BRCA1
methylation and hence were assigned a homozygous status. The
two PDX from HGSOC from patients treated with multiple lines
of prior therapy (#48 and #169) were consistently found to harbor
around
50%
methylation and, therefore,
were assigned
a
heterozygous status. The presence of two peaks in the MS-
HRM analysis indicated that methylation was concordant across
the four sites, as molecules with partial methylation would have
intermediate melting temperatures and form more complex
patterns (Supplementary Fig. 5). Analysis of the matched source
patient HGSOC samples was also consistent with homozygous
(#11 and #62) and heterozygous (#48 and #169) methylation of
the BRCA1 promoter, although due to variable neoplastic purity
in patient HGSOC samples, it was more challenging to estimate
the proportion of methylated copies (Supplementary Data 4).
RNA-seq, BRCA1 quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-
PCR) and western blotting (WB) analysis showed markedly
reduced BRCA1 expression in the two source patient HGSOC
samples and matched PDX models with homozygous methyla-
tion, but not in the two with heterozygous methylation, further
supporting that methylation, mutation, or loss of all copies is
required for BRCA1 silencing (Supplementary Fig. 6a–c, Supple-
mentary Table 1)26. We assessed HR pathway activity by ex vivo

 RAD51 foci formation assay, which showed formation of RAD51
foci in response to DNA damage in PDX #169, which harbored
heterozygous methylation, but not in PDX #11 or PDX #62,
which both harbored homozygous methylation (Fig. 3c, d,
Supplementary Fig. 7).
One of the two chemo-naive PDX with homozygous BRCA1
promoter methylation (#62) responded to 300 mg kg−1 rucaparib,
with tumor regressions observed in two of seven mice (median
TTH 71 days vs. vehicle 18 days, p < 0.001, log-rank test, n = 7,
11) (Table 1, Fig. 3e). This was notable, given that PDX #62 was
resistant/refractory to cisplatin (defined as three or more mice
with tumor progressing during cisplatin treatment) and was
characterized by the presence of multiple oncogene amplifications
(Table 1)34. The other PDX with homozygous BRCA1 methyla-
tion (#11), despite being exquisitely sensitive to platinum34, failed
to respond to rucaparib at the low dose tested (150 mg kg−1) but
was not exposed to 300 and 450 mg kg−1 (Supplementary Data 2,
Supplementary Fig. 6d). However, the patient from whom PDX
#11 was derived subsequently received single-agent rucaparib
with starting dose of 600 mg twice daily and had a partial
response (PR) of 10 months as demonstrated by Response
Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1)
(Fig. 3f, g), suggesting that in the PDX, a higher dose of rucaparib
treatment in vivo may have been efficacious.

 Conversely, no disease stabilization or tumor regression was
observed in response to rucaparib for either PDX #48 or #169
both of which harbored heterozygous BRCA1 promoter methyla-
tion (Table 1, Fig. 3h, i). In terms of the corresponding patient
courses, case #48 progressed 4 months following third-line
platinum therapy, at which point the disease was biopsied (PDX
established) and she was subsequently treated with single-agent
PARPi therapy, progressing after just 2 months. Case #169 had
platinum refractory disease and progressed within 1 month of
first-line carboplatin/paclitaxel chemotherapy (PDX established
from ascites) and did not receive a PARPi. Importantly, the
heterozygous BRCA1 methylation status in both cases reflected a
change from baseline. DNA from archival patient HGSOC
samples for cases #48 and #169 revealed homozygous BRCA1
methylation in chemotherapy-naive ascites collected at diagnosis
for both cases and also in the surgical debulking samples

 following neoadjuvant chemotherapy for both cases (Supplemen-
tary Data 4).
BRCA1 promoter methylation was also examined in PDX
samples upon cancer recurrence following in vivo treatment with
either cisplatin or rucaparib. No loss of homozygous BRCA1
methylation was observed for either PDX #11 or #62 following
treatment with rucaparib or cisplatin (Fig. 3b). Similarly, no loss
of heterozygous BRCA1 methylation or gain of homozygous
methylation was observed for either PDX #48 or #169 following
treatment with either cisplatin or rucaparib (Fig. 3b).
Variable rucaparib responses in BRCA1-methylated cell lines.
To further study whether BRCA1 promoter methylation predis-
poses OC cells to rucaparib response through loss of the HR
pathway activity, we generated a cell line from PDX #62
(WEHICS62) that retained homozygous BRCA1 methylation.
Reduced expression of BRCA1 mRNA, consistent with silencing
of BRCA1, was observed in RNA-seq and qRT-PCR analysis of
the WEHICS62 cell line (two samples), the matched PDX (six
samples), and the baseline patient HGSOC sample, compared to a
PDX with unmethylated wild-type BRCA1 (Supplementary
Fig. 6b, Supplementary Fig. 8). In contrast, OVCAR8, a cell line
generated from a patient with OC refractory to carboplatin38,39
and previously reported to harbor BRCA1 methylation40, was
found to have heterozygous BRCA1 methylation when assessed
by quantitative MS-ddPCR (~66% methylation with three copies
of BRCA1, likely two methylated copies and one unmethylated
copy) (Supplementary Table 2–3, Supplementary Fig. 9). Fur-
thermore, BRCA1 expression was detected by qRT-PCR (Sup-
plementary Fig. 6b). This finding was in keeping with our
previous report of the ability of OVCAR8 cells to form RAD51
foci and resistance of the OVCAR8 cell line to both platinum and
PARPi agents in vitro, both consistent with a competent HR
pathway17.
The homozygous BRCA1-methylated cell line, WEHICS62, had
a reduced capacity to form RAD51 foci in response to IR damage,
as did an HR-deficient cell line derivative of OVCAR8 (with
RAD51C KO), when compared to the heterozygous BRCA1-
methylated OVCAR8 cell line, a second HR-competent OC cell
line, OV90, or a normal immortalized fallopian tube epithelial cell
line, FT28241 (Fig. 4a, b). Colony formation and cell proliferation
analyses
revealed
that
WEHICS62
cells
were
sensitive
to
rucaparib, as were the HR-deficient cell line derivative of
OVCAR8 (with RAD51C KO) and the BRCA2-mutant OC cell
line PEO142. In comparison, the parental OVCAR8 cell line with
heterozygous
BRCA1
promoter
methylation
and
the
HR-
competent PEO4 OC cell line were not sensitive to rucaparib
in vitro (Fig. 4c, d).
Rucaparib
response
in
patients
with
BRCA1-methylated
HGSOC. To investigate whether heterozygous and homozygous
BRCA1 promoter methylation correlated with PARPi response in
clinical samples, we used quantitative MS-ddPCR to analyze the
archival and pre-treatment (study-entry) tumor biopsies from 21
patients who were identified to have BRCA1-methylated HGSOC
from the cohort of 204 patients treated on the ARIEL2 Part 1
single-agent rucaparib trial32 (detail provided in methods,
Table 2, Supplementary Data 5). To determine BRCA1 methyla-
tion percentage and zygosity status in tumor cells, the raw MS-
ddPCR percentage of methylated copies was adjusted for neo-
plastic cellularity and BRCA1 copy number. This adjustment was
required because the expected proportion of observed unmethy-
lated copies is dependent on the ratio of unmethylated somatic
copies to tumor copies at the BRCA1 locus. A BRCA1 copy
number of 1 was assigned in cases where LOH was consistently
predicted by both the Foundation Medicine T5 test and the
BROCA assay and a copy number of 1 was reported by the
Foundation Medicine T5 test. Cases that had a single methylated
BRCA1 locus and deletion of the second allele were classified as
homozygous for BRCA1 methylation. Low estimated neoplastic
cellularity (of 20%) precluded accurate determination of BRCA1
methylation zygosity in five out of 32 samples (archival and/or
pre-treatment) tested from the 21 cases. Archival BRCA1
methylation zygosity status could be determined with high con-
fidence for 17 cases: ten cases were homozygous and seven cases
were heterozygous (four of which had surgery at the time of
diagnosis).
In order to assess the impact of BRCA1 methylation zygosity
on PARPi response, as determined at the time of treatment
commencement, we focused on ARIEL2 cases for which pre-
treatment biopsy samples were available for BRCA1 methylation
analysis. For 12 of the 21 BRCA1-methylated cases, sufficient
material
from
pre-treatment
tumor
biopsies was available
(Supplementary Data 5). Eight of the 12 cases (#15–21) had
homozygous BRCA1 methylation in the pre-treatment tumor
biopsy, six of these (#16–21) were high confidence calls based on
neoplastic cellularity of >20% (these six cases are hereafter
referred to as the homozygous BRCA1 methylation (high
confidence) subgroup). Two of the 12 cases with material
available for analysis (#1, 2) had homozygous and heterozygous
BRCA1 methylation, respectively, in the archival sample, and no
evidence of methylation in the pre-treatment tumor biopsy

 (Table 2), consistent with loss of methylation. Two final cases (#7,
8) had heterozygous BRCA1 methylation in both the archival
sample and matched pre-treatment tumor biopsy.
We hypothesized that patients with homozygous BRCA1
methylation (high confidence) at the time of enrollment into
the trial (n = 6) would respond similarly to the BRCA1/2 mutant
subgroup with higher response rates and a longer PFS than
patients with BRCA1/2 wild-type tumors that had never been
observed to have any BRCA1 methylation (BRCA1/2 wild-type
non-BRCA1-methylated). The homozygous BRCA1 methylation
(high confidence) subgroup had a median PFS of 14.5 months
(95% CI 4.8–18.3, n = 6) comparable to the BRCA1/2 mutant
subgroup (12.8 months, 95% CI 9.0–14.7, n = 40). Whilst not
statistically significant, the PFS was longer for the high-
confidence homozygous BRCA1-methylated group when com-
pared
to
BRCA1/2
wild-type
non-BRCA1-methylated
cases
(5.5 months, 95% CI 5.0–6.2, p = 0.062, log-rank test, n = 143)
(Fig. 5a).
All
homozygous BRCA1 methylation
samples
had
high
genomic LOH scores (>16%), an indirect marker of potential
HR deficiency through genomic scarring6 (Fig. 5b, Supplemen-
tary Fig. 10a). The mean LOH score for homozygous BRCA1-
methylated cases was significantly higher than for BRCA1/2 wild-
type non-BRCA1-methylated cases (27.9 vs. 15.9, p = 0.04,
independent
t-test).
There
were
no
significant
differences
observed in the mean genomic LOH scores between the
homozygous BRCA1 methylation subgroup and the subgroup of
other cases which had ever had any BRCA1 methylation (Table 2,
Fig. 5b, Supplementary Fig. 10a), indicating that these samples
may have harbored homozygous BRCA1 methylation in the past,
leading to accumulation of genomic scarring.
The objective response rates in the high confidence homo-
zygous BRCA1-methylated subgroup were significantly better
compared to BRCA1/2 wild-type non-BRCA1-methylated cases
(n = 143 cases, p = 0.0014, Fisher Exact test, Supplementary
Table 4), with five of six (83%) patients with homozygous BRCA1
methylation detected in the pre-treatment biopsy achieving a PR
and the sixth patient having a 33% reduction in target lesions that
was not confirmed by subsequent CT scanning and was classified
instead as stable disease (SD). A significant difference in
reduction in the mean change in target lesion sizes was observed
between the homozygous BRCA1-methylated groups and BRCA1/
2 wild-type non-BRCA1-methylated cases (−53.9 vs. −13.5%,
p = 0.001, independent t-test, Fig. 5c, d, Supplementary Fig. 10b).
These findings indicated that cases with confirmed homozygous
BRCA1 promoter methylation were more likely to respond to
rucaparib.
Discussion
To improve our understanding of the sensitivity and resistance
mechanisms to PARP inhibitors, both primary and acquired, we
assessed the in vivo rucaparib response of 12 chemo-naive or
post-treatment HGSOC PDX. Variable responses to rucaparib
were observed in the four chemo-naive HGSOC PDX with
BRCA1/2 mutations, ranging from complete response (CR) to
progressive disease. Of note, PARPi response has not been tested
in the chemo-naive setting in the clinic, but our results were in
keeping with the range of single-agent PARPi responses reported
for patients with recurrent BRCA1/2 mutant HGSOC1,32,43. We
also explored mechanisms of acquired PARPi resistance by
screening post-rucaparib treated PDX samples for the presence of
reversion or secondary BRCA1/2 mutations and none were
observed. None of the four PDX thought to be HR proficient
showed regression or disease stabilization in response to ruca-
parib treatment in vivo.
Recently, the ARIEL2 Part 1 trial reported that OC with
BRCA1 promoter methylation had increased levels of genomic
LOH, a historical marker of HR deficiency, with some durable
responses being reported32. To further investigate whether
BRCA1 methylation sensitized HGSOC to PARPi, we focused on
the four PDX harboring this epigenetic lesion. PDX models have
the advantage that the human component of PDX samples is
highly enriched for neoplastic cellularity in comparison with
baseline patient samples. Two of the three orthogonal BRCA1
methylation assays used in this study were quantitative; either
semi-quantitative (MS-HRM) or fully quantitative (MS-ddPCR),
and both were human specific. As a result, we were able to
observe two states of BRCA1 methylation, homozygous and
heterozygous, in the four BRCA1-methylated PDX studied. When
we took into account the zygosity status of BRCA1 methylation—
which importantly has not been systematically addressed in the
literature with respect to clinical outcomes and association with
response to PARPi or platinum29,33—we observed that the zyg-
osity of each of the four BRCA1-methylated PDX correlated with
the zygostity status of the source tumor used to generate PDX,
and did not change under the pressure of subsequent in vivo
treatment of the PDX. The two chemo-naive HGSOC and cor-
responding PDX with homozygous BRCA1 methylation showed

Fig. 5 Homozygous BRCA1 methylation and rucaparib response in the ARIEL2 Part 1 trial. a Kaplan–Meier progression-free survival analysis of patients with
HGSOC with homozygous BRCA1 methylation in the pre-treatment tumor biopsy, which was of high confidence based on adequate neoplastic cellularity
(homozygous BRCA1 methylation (high confidence)), compared with patients with HGSOC in which there had ever been any other evidence of BRCA1
methylation (ever any BRCA1 methylation), compared with all other patients in the ARIEL2 Part 1 trial without any BRCA1 methylation (BRCA1/2 mutant vs.
BRCA1/2 wild-type non-BRCA1-methylated subgroups). Shaded areas represent 95% CI for homozygous BRCA1 methylation (high confidence) and ever any
BRCA1 methylation, other groups. b Genome-wide LOH % assessed in the pre-treatment biopsies compared across subgroups: homozygous BRCA1

 low BRCA1 expression by RNA-seq and responded to rucaparib
in either the PDX or patient. Conversely, the two PDX with
heterozygous BRCA1 methylation and some expression of BRCA1
by RNA-seq, had been generated from HGSOC treated with
multiple lines of prior therapy and had failed to respond to
rucaparib. In keeping with the possibility that partial loss of
methylation may have occurred under treatment pressure, ana-
lysis of chemo-naive archival HGSOC samples for these two cases
indicated homozygous BRCA1 methylation. These PDX studies,
coupled
with
earlier
reports
correlating
complete
BRCA1
methylation and LOH at the BRCA1 locus21, provide evidence
that, as is the case for BRCA1 mutated carcinomas26, silencing of
all copies of BRCA1 by promoter methylation is required to cause
an HR defect of sufficient magnitude to induce PARPi-related
synthetic lethality.
Consistent with these findings in PDX, we also observed that
BRCA1
promoter
methylation
zygosity
influenced
PARPi
response in OC cell lines. The OVCAR8 cell line has been
reported to be methylated at the BRCA1 promoter, with reduction
in BRCA1 mRNA and protein expression40,44, but nevertheless
has been reported to be HR competent45. In keeping with this
paradox, we found that despite having a genomic profile con-
sistent with genomic scarring and HR deficiency46, OVCAR8 cells
formed RAD51 foci in response to DNA damage and were
resistant to PARPi in vitro, consistent with an intact HR pathway.
Notably, the BRCA1 methylation status of OVCAR8 was het-
erozygous. In contrast, we generated a HGSOC PDX-derived cell
line, WEHICS62, which retained homozygous BRCA1 methyla-
tion, had reduced ability to form RAD51 foci and was sensitive to
rucaparib in vitro. The low number of cell lines reported to date
with homozygous loss of BRCA1 or loss of function by
mutation40,47 suggests possible selection against BRCA1-deficient
cells in two-dimensional culture. Thus, the zygosity status of
BRCA1-methylated cell lines should be ascertained and re-
confirmed regularly in studies where the HR status is critical.
In order to investigate BRCA1 promoter methylation zygosity
in clinical samples, we studied 21 high-grade OC with BRCA1
methylation from the ARIEL2 Part 1 trial32. Establishing the
zygosity of BRCA1 methylation in patient samples was more
challenging than in PDX, due to the variability in the proportion
of normal stroma within each clinical sample, as well as variation
in BRCA1 gene copy number. We were able to identify six high-
grade OC, in which we determined with high confidence that
homozygous BRCA1 methylation was present at the time of trial
enrollment (in the pre-rucaparib treatment biopsy, with neo-
plastic cellularity >20%). Consistent with our hypothesis that
homozygous methylation was required for sensitivity to ruca-
parib, we observed a strong association between homozygous
BRCA1 methylation and rucaparib response, compared to
BRCA1/2 wild-type non-BRCA1-methylated cases. It would thus
be important for patient selection/stratification to use a highly
quantitative method for methylation assessment, as well as
accurate estimation of neoplastic cellularity and BRCA1 copy
number to determine the zygosity of BRCA1 methylation, even at
diagnosis, when BRCA1-methylated cases might already have
heterozygous rather than homozygous methylation. Indeed, our
data strongly suggest that methylation zygosity should be assessed
in contemporaneous tumor samples before any firm conclusions
are drawn regarding the impact of BRCA1 methylation on ther-
apeutic efficacy29,33.
Genomic scarring assays, such as percentage genomic LOH
score, are indicative of defective HR DNA repair and are likely to
identify HR-defective cases with homozygous BRCA1 methyla-
tion. However, there will also be false-positive cases, where HR
has been restored (e.g., through loss of methylation) yet the
genomic scarring remains, reflecting a history of prior HR
deficiency rather than the current HR status. In keeping with this,
LOH status (percentage genomic LOH score) was not different in
the BRCA1 homozygous methylated vs. “ever-methylated” cases
in the ARIEL2 Part 1 trial. Furthermore, we identified cases in our
clinical studies that supported the hypothesis that loss of
methylation of the BRCA1 promoter could occur under platinum
treatment pressure. In our PDX studies, we observed altered
zygosity of BRCA1 methylation, from homozygosity in the
chemo-naive archival clinical sample to heterozygosity in the
previously-treated HGSOC patient source sample used to gen-
erate the PDX. Thus, heterozygous BRCA1-methylated cases may
represent loss of methylation from an earlier homozygous BRCA1
methylation and HR-deficient state, contributing to PARPi
resistance.
A survival advantage has been demonstrated for BRCA1/2
mutated HGSOC treated with platinum-based therapies7, despite
reversion of BRCA1/2 mutation occurring under treatment
pressure14–16. However, a number of challenges may exist in
demonstrating a survival advantage for BRCA1 promoter-
methylated HGSOC. The first is that our data suggest that
cases need to be classified according to BRCA1 methylation
zygosity. The second is that homozygous BRCA1 methylation
loss may occur readily under chemotherapy pressure, as our
analysis of the ARIEL2 data suggests, necessitating a pre-
treatment biopsy. Confirmatory studies of BRCA1 methylation
zygosity in larger clinical cohorts will also be required; however,
large PARPi trials in OC have focused on the maintenance set-
ting, where tumor tissue immediately prior to PARPi has not
been collected. The ARIEL2 Part 1 study is the only study to date
which has routinely collected pre-treatment biopsies and which
is of sufficient size to permit this analysis (204 patients enrolled
with the expected case rate of BRCA1 methylation of ~10%,
yielding 21 BRCA1-methylated cases, of which 12 had homo-
zygous methylation in the archival biopsy, eight of which had
homozygous methylation in the pre-treatment biopsy (six of
which were of adequate tumor purity)). Given the difficulty in
accessing additional similar or larger cohorts, our data support
early scheduling of PARPi treatment, for example in the first-line
maintenance setting, or as combination PARPi therapy upon
first relapse, to minimize the population of malignant cells in
which loss of methylation and consequently resistance to treat-
ment can occur.
In summary, the study of PDX models, in which quantitative
assessment of tumor BRCA1 promoter methylation is not
obscured by stromal signal or complicated by variable copy
number, enabled the observation that homozygous methylation
and complete silencing of BRCA1 induces HR deficiency and
PARPi sensitivity. By using a highly quantitative method and
adjusting for neoplastic cellularity and BRCA1 copy number, we
identified patients with homozygous BRCA1 methylation in the
ARIEL2 Part 1 PARPi study and observed improved clinical
outcomes. This study is the first to clarify the critical role of
BRCA1 methylation zygosity in the response of carcinomas to
PARPi and has potentially important clinical implications. Fur-
ther development and refinement of methods to accurately and
efficiently classify BRCA1 homozygous methylation status, and a
suitably powered prospective clinical trial are required to validate
our findings that homozygous BRCA1 methylation predicts
PARPi sensitivity. Further, BRCA1 methylation loss in carcino-
mas exposed to chemotherapy underscores the importance of
real-time pre-treatment biopsies to assess methylation as a pre-
dictor of response to treatment in women with recurrent
HGSOC. As with secondary mutations in BRCA1/2, loss of
methylation of BRCA1 under treatment pressure disables a
therapeutic mechanism of response, suggesting that earlier
introduction of PARPi therapy in the disease trajectory may

 prevent such resistance mechanisms emerging under treatment
pressure.
Methods
Study approval. All experiments involving animals were performed according to
the animal ethics guidelines and were approved by the Walter and Eliza Hall
Institute of Medical Research Animal Ethics Committee. PDX were generated from
OC, with patients enrolled in the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study. Informed
consent was obtained from all patients, and all experiments were performed
according to the human ethics guidelines. Additional ethics approval was obtained
from the Human Research Ethics Committees at the Royal Women’s Hospital and
the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute.
Patient samples. Surgical, biopsy or ascites HGSOC samples used for PDX gen-
eration were collected from chemotherapy-naive patients who underwent surgery
or patients treated with multiple lines of prior therapy. Clinical follow-up of patient
outcome was obtained via the database at the Royal Women’s Hospital. Archival
tumor and pre-treatment biopsy samples from 23 patients used for re-testing of
BRCA1 promoter methylation were collected as part of the ARIEL2 Part 1 trial
(NCT01891344)32. All clinical information used for interrogating rucaparib
response in ARIEL2 Part 1 participating patients was collected as part of the
ARIEL2 Part 1 trial32. Patient response was assessed according to RECIST 1.1.
Generation and treatment of PDX. PDX were generated as published previously
by transplanting fresh fragments subcutaneously or via the intra-ovarian bursal
approach into NOD/SCID/IL2Rγnull recipient mice (T1, passage 1)34, with the
exception of PDX #169, which was generated from tumor ascites. Briefly, tumor
cells were isolated from ascites after centrifugation and red blood cell lysis. The
tumor cells were resuspended in diluted Matrigel Matrix (Corning) and were
subcutaneously injected.
Recipient mice bearing T2–T9 (passage 2 to passage 9) tumors were randomly
assigned to treatment with rucaparib, cisplatin or vehicle when tumor volume
reached 180–300 mm3. In vivo cisplatin treatments were performed as previously
described34. The regimen for rucaparib treatment was oral gavage once daily
(Monday–Friday) for 3 weeks at 150, 300, or 450 mg kg−1. Tumors were measured
twice per week and recorded in StudyLog software (StudyLog Systems). Tumors
were harvested once tumor volume reached 600–700 mm3 or when mice reached
ethical endpoint. Nadir, time to progression (TTP or PD), TTH, and treatment
responses are as defined previously34. Tumor volume and survival graphs were
produced with SurvivalVolume v1.248. Median TTH was calculated by including
censored events for PDX where mice were harvested when the tumor volume was
>500 mm3 but <600 mm3 (for rucaparib response for PDX #62, 4 out of 6 mice).
CR was achieved if the average tumor volume for the treatment group reduced to
<50 mm3 for two or more consecutive measurements. PR was achieved if the
average tumor volume reduced to between 50 and 140 mm3 (>30% reduction from
nadir, assigned as 200 mm3) for two or more consecutive measurements. SD was
achieved if TTP for the treatment group was at least twice as long as TTP for the
corresponding vehicle group.
Cell lines and culture. The human OC cell line OVCAR8 was obtained from the
NCI. Early passages of the parental OVCAR8 and RAD51C KO 2–130 were
cryopreserved, and were last authenticated by STR profiling in April 2017. Sub-
sequent revivals were used within 6 months. OC cell line WEHICS62 was generated
from PDX #62, by digesting cells with human tumor dissociation kit (Mitenyl
Biotec) with gentleMACS dissociator, and then enriching for viable Epcam (347197
1:30; BD) positive cells using flow cytometry. Early-passage were viably stored;
subsequent thaws were used within 6 months. The STR profile for WEHICS62 was
generated in April 2017: Amelogenin—X; CSF1PO—allele 12; D13S317—allele 9;
D16S539—allele 13; D21S11—alleles 29, 30; D5S818—allele 7; D7S820—allele 9;
TH01—allele 7; TPOX—allele 8; and vWA—alleles 17, 18. The PEO4 and PEO1
cell lines were obtained from F. Couch (Mayo Clinic) in 2013 and viably stored
until 2016. Subsequent thaws were used within 6 months; were last authenticated
by STR profiling in April 2017. All cell lines were routinely tested and shown to be
negative for Mycoplasma. Cell lines were cultured in RPMI-1640 (Corning) sup-
plemented with 10% FBS (Peak Serum) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin
(Corning) or in DMEM/F12, GlutaMAX with 5 µg ml−1 insulin, 50 ng ml−1 EGF,
and 1 µg ml−1 hydrocortisone in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. FT282 cells were
grown in DMEM:Ham’s F12 (50:50) without HEPES in the presence of Ultroser G
serum substitute.
Compounds. Rucaparib camsylate salt was manufactured by Lonza. Cisplatin was
obtained from Pfizer.
RAD51 foci formation assay. For RAD51 foci assay in cell lines, cells were first
treated with 10 mM EdU, then shortly after irradiated with 10 Gy. Cells were fixed
6 h post irradiation with 10% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.3% TritonX-
100, blocked with blocking buffer (5% goat serum, 0.3% TritonX-100 in PBS), and
incubated with rabbit anti-human RAD51 (ab63801 1:100; Abcam), followed by
incubation with goat anti-rabbit 488 secondary antibody (1:600; Invitrogen). Cells
were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in Click-IT reaction (100 mM Tris
pH 8.5, 10 nM Alexa Fluor 647-azide (Cat# A10277, Thermo Fisher Scientific),
1 mM CuSO4, and 100 mM ascorbic acid), then washed with PBS. Nuclei were
counterstained with DAPI in Vectashield mounting media (Vector Labs). Images
were acquired on an Olympus BX-61 microscope equipped with a Spot RT camera
(model 25.4), using the Spot Advanced software. EdU positive cells with more than
10 RAD51 foci/nucleus were manually scored. At least 170 cells from three inde-
pendent experiments were counted.
For ex vivo RAD51 foci assay, tumor tissue was first harvested, then placed in
cell culturing medium and shortly after irradiated with 10 Gy or left untreated.
Tissue fragments were fixed 4 h post irradiation for 2 h with 4% paraformaldehyde,
then incubated in 10, 20, and 30% sucrose, embedded in Tissue-Tek® O.C.T.
(optimal cutting temperature) compound (Sakura Finetek), and 4 µm sections were
cut. Following antigen retrieval with pH 6 citrate buffer (Dako) in a pressure
cooker, sections were permeabilized for 20 min with 0.2% Triton-X, washed in
DPBS, and blocked for 30 min with blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 2%
fetal bovine serum in DPBS). Sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit
anti-human RAD51 (ab133534 1:100; Abcam) or rabbit anti-human γH2AX (20E3
1:200; Cell Signaling), washed with DPBS, then incubated for 1 h at room
temperature (RT) with anti-rabbit 488 secondary antibody (1:800; Invitrogen),
washed with DPBS, then incubated for 1 h at RT with mouse anti-human Geminin
(ab104306 1:100; Abcam), washed with DPBS, then incubated for 1 h at RT with
anti-mouse 546 secondary antibody (1:800, Invitrogen) and Hoechst (1 drop ml−1),
then washed with DPBS and mounted with Fluoromount-G® (SouthernBiotech).
All antibody dilutions were done with blocking buffer. Sections were imaged using
a LSM 780 inverse laser scanning microscope (Zeiss) and captured with an LSM T-
PMT detector (Zeiss) using z-stacks. Z-stacks were flattened using Z projection
function with maximum intensity in Fiji software. At least 230 cells from four fields
of view and three independent experiments were counted. Cells with ≥5 RAD51 or
γH2AX foci/geminin-positive nucleus were scored using CellProfiler (version 2.2.0,
Broad Institute).
Cell proliferation assay. Cell count proliferation assay was performed using
IncuCyte ZOOM system according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cells
were seeded (OVCAR8 at 500 cells; OVCAR8-RAD51C KO and WEHISC62 at
2000 cells) in 96-well plates and incubated overnight before adding treatments.
Cells were treated for up to 14 days with rucaparib at 0.5 or 2 µM or medium.
Medium with rucaparib or without rucaparib was replenished at 7 days.
Colony formation assay. Colony formation assay was performed on OC cell lines
PEO4, PEO1, OVCAR8, and WEHICS62. Briefly, cells were seeded at 100 cells in
6-well plates and incubated overnight before adding treatments. Cells were treated
with rucaparib at 5, 12.5, 25, 50, and 250 nM or equivalent amount of DMSO (no
treatment control). The experiment was terminated when colonies formed in
cultures without treatment (PEO4 cells fixed at 14 days; OVCAR8 and PEO1 cells
fixed at 10 days; WEHICS62 cells fixed at 21 days). Colonies were fixed with 0.5%
Crystal Violet and 20% methanol for 20 min. Colonies were counted blindly by
three individuals, and then the average count was taken for each replicate.
Immunohistochemistry. Staining was performed using an automated platform
with a DAKO Omnis (Agilent Pathology Solutions) on all first-generation PDX
samples (T1) to confirm the retention of HGSOC characteristics when compared to
the clinical pathology report, or in-house staining, at the time of sample collection.
The following antibodies were used: p53 (M700101 1:100; Dako), Ki67 (M7240
1:50; Dako), Cytokeratin (M3515 1:200; Dako), PAX8 (10336–1-AP 1:20000;
Proteintech), and WT1 (ab15249 1:800; Abcam). CD45 (M0701 1:500; Dako) was
used to exclude donor-derived transplantable hematologic malignancy. Scoring was
performed for each PDX by one investigator on one tumor section each from at
least three independent mice bearing that PDX and from the relevant baseline
patient tumor. Usually ten high-powered fields (for some only five were available)
were surveilled and the staining estimated as follows: 3+ almost all tumor cells
were strongly positive; 2+ >25% of tumor cells were strongly positive or nearly all
tumor cells were moderately positive; 1+ <25% of tumor cells were moderately to
strongly positive, or nearly all cells were weakly positive; 0 occasional positive cells
only.
Genomic analyses and qRT-PCR. RNA-seq was performed on 12 baseline patient
HGSOC samples used to generate PDX, and on two PDX samples (#169 and #201)
to verify expression levels observed in the matched HGSOC with suboptimal
sample quality due to either low neoplastic cellularity or poor RNA quality.
Libraries were prepared using TruSeq RNA Library Prep Kit v2, and the sequen-
cing was performed on the Ilumina HiSeq 2500 platform to read length of 50 bp
(Australian Genome Research Facility). Reads were mapped to Human GRCh38
(GCA_000001405.15) with dbSNP150 and Ensembl 90 annotation using
HISAT249, and annotated against dbSNP150 and Ensembl 90. Counts were done
using HTSeq50, and TMM normalization was performed51. Expression plots were
produced using Matplotlib. Baseline patient HGSOC sample #80 had to be

 excluded from final analysis as it failed alignment QC due to high proportion of
multi-mapping reads.
For qRT-PCR BRCA1 assay, RNA was converted to cDNA using Superscript III
Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen), and qPCR was performed using SYBR Green
PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) following manufacturer’s instructions.
Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 5. Ct values for each sample
were normalized to the average Ct values of four different housekeeping genes
(HPRT1, ACTB, SDHA, and GAPDH), and resulting values were used to calculate
fold-change of BRCA1 expression for each sample.
Baseline patient HGSOC samples used to generate PDX or PDX samples were
sequenced using Foundation Medicine’s NGS-based T5a assay52. Analyzed
data were plotted using OncoPrint. HR-DNA repair gene mutations were
assessed by sequencing of PDX samples using the NGS-based BROCA assay: PDX
#11, #13, #27, #29, #56, #62 were analyzed using BROCA v4 assay and were
previously published34; and all others were analyzed by BROCA v6 (Supplementary
Data 6).
Copy number analysis of BRCA1 was performed using MLPA-seq assay as
previous described53. Amplicon sequencing of TP53 gene was performed on the
patient HGSOC and PDX samples to estimate the neoplastic cellularity proportion.
Amplicon libraries were prepared and sequenced as previously described17, with
primers listed in the Supplementary Table 5. Samples from the four BRCA1/2
mutant HGSOC were screened for reversion mutations by NGS and Sanger
sequencing. Sanger sequencing was performed to amplify target regions in PDX
#13, #19, #54, and #56. Long-range PCR was used to amplify target regions in PDX
#19 and #56 samples, with primers specified in Supplementary Table 5. Briefly,
100–120 ng of DNA was amplified with TaKaRa LA Taq polymerase (Takara Bio
Inc) or Phusion Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the following cycling
conditions: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min or 98 °C for 30 s (respectively),
followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C or 98 °C for 15 s, 60–62.8 °C for 30 s or 64–58 °C
(−0.2 °C sec−1) for 20 s (respectively), and 68 °C for 15 min or 72 °C for 3 min
(respectively), followed by final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Long-range PCR
products were cleaned using Agencourt AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter) beads at
1:0.4 ratio following the manufacturer’s protocol then processed using the Nextera
XT DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina) according to manufacturer’s protocol.
The libraries were sequenced using a 300-cycle MiSeq Nano Reagent Kit v2
(Illumina).
Promoter methylation analysis. Promoter methylation of BRCA1 PDX samples
was determined by methylation-sensitive PCR as previously described21. BRCA1
methylation was confirmed by MS-HRM, as previously described24. Quantification
of BRCA1 methylation levels in PDX sample series, cell lines, and ARIEL2 Part 1
patient sample series was assessed by a quantitative MS-ddPCR methodology.
DNA was bisulfite converted using the EZ DNA Methylation-Lightning kit (Zymo
Research). Primers were designed for a 72 bp amplicon in the BRCA1 UTR. MGB
probes hybridizing to the fully methylated (VIC labeled) and the fully unmethy-
lated sequences (FAM labeled) were used. Droplet digital PCR was performed on
the Bio-Rad QX-200 system.
Western blotting. Nuclear lysates were prepared from snap frozen tumor frag-
ments. Western blotting was carried out using NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic
Extraction Reagents (Thermo Scientific) as previously described54 and proteins
were detected using the following antibodies: BRCA1 (OP92-MS110 1:500,
Calbiochem) and Tubulin (2148 1:2000, Cell Signaling).
Analysis of ARIEL2 Part 1 clinical trial cases. Of 204 patients included in the
ARIEL2 Part 1 clinical trial and treated with single-agent rucaparib, 23 cases had
evidence of BRCA1 promoter methylation according to prior MSP analysis32. For
these 23 cases, we assessed BRCA1 methylation in a second DNA extraction from
the same tumor sample by MS-ddPCR. Two of the 23 cases were excluded from the
BRCA1-methylated subgroup because assessment did not confirm BRCA1
methylation. Of the 21 samples with BRCA1 methylation by MS-ddPCR, pre-
treatment biopsies were available for 12 cases, eight of which had homozygous
BRCA1 methylation, and six of these were of high confidence based on adequate
neoplastic cellularity (high-confidence homozygous BRCA1 methylation, n = 6).
The other 15 cases were included in the “ever any BRCA1 methylation” subgroup
as they had other evidence of BRCA1 methylation, which was not high-confidence
homozygous methylation in the pre-treatment biopsy. These cases were compared
to all other HGSOC from the ARIEL2 Part 1 trial without any evidence of BRCA1
methylation (204 cases, minus 21 cases = 183 cases), subdivided by BRCA1/2
mutant (n = 40 cases) and BRCA1/2 wild-type (BRCA1/2 wild-type non-BRCA1-
methylated n = 143 cases) status.
Statistics. Statistical analysis was performed to compare the high-confidence
homozygous BRCA1-methylated subgroup of patients (homozygous BRCA1
methylation (high confidence), n = 6 cases) with the subgroup of cases with any
other evidence of BRCA1 methylation (ever any BRCA1 methylation, n = 15 cases),
or with the BRCA1/2 mutant subgroup (n = 40) or the BRCA1/2 wild-type non-
BRCA1-methylated subgroup (n = 143). Statistical analysis was performed in
Python 3.6.1 using the pandas v0.20.2, lifelines v0.11.1, seaborn v0.8.1, matplotlib
v2.0.2, and scipy v0.19.1 packages. Comparisons were made between high-
confidence homozygous BRCA1-methylated subgroup of patients and the BRCA1/2
wild-type non-methylated subgroup. No statistical comparison was made between
the high-confidence homozygous BRCA1-methylated subgroup of patients and the
ever any BRCA1 methylation subgroup, as the latter group contains low confidence
homozygous and ambiguous cases. Fisher Exact test was used to compare the
investigator-confirmed best response, independent t-test was used to compare the
minimum percentage change of target lesion, and Kaplan–Meier analysis and log
rank test were used to compare PFS.
