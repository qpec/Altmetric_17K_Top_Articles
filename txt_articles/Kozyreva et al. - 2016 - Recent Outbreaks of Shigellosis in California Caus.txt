ABSTRACT
Shigella sonnei has caused unusually large outbreaks of shigellosis in
California in 2014 and 2015. Preliminary data indicated the involvement of two dis-
tinct bacterial populations, one from San Diego and San Joaquin (SDi/SJo) and one
from the San Francisco (SFr) Bay area. Whole-genome analysis and antibiotic suscep-
tibility testing of 68 outbreak and archival isolates of S. sonnei were performed to in-
vestigate the microbiological factors related to these outbreaks. Both SDi/SJo and
SFr populations, as well as almost all of the archival S. sonnei isolates belonged to
sequence type 152 (ST152). Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
analysis clustered the majority of California (CA) isolates to an earlier described lin-
eage III. Isolates in the SDi/SJo population had a novel lambdoid bacteriophage car-
rying genes encoding Shiga toxin (STX) that were most closely related to that found
in Escherichia coli O104:H4. However, the STX genes (stx1A and stx1B) from this
novel phage had sequences most similar to the phages from Shigella flexneri and
S. dysenteriae. The isolates in the SFr population were resistant to ciprofloxacin due
to point mutations in gyrA and parC genes and were related to the fluoroquinolone-
resistant S. sonnei clade within lineage III that originated in South Asia. The emer-
gence of a highly virulent S. sonnei strain and introduction of a fluoroquinolone-
resistant strain reflect the changing traits of this pathogen in California. An
enhanced monitoring is advocated for early detection of future outbreaks caused by
such strains.
IMPORTANCE Shigellosis is an acute diarrheal disease causing nearly half a million
infections, 6,000 hospitalizations, and 70 deaths annually in the United States. S. son-
nei caused two unusually large outbreaks in 2014 and 2015 in California. We used
whole-genome sequencing to understand the pathogenic potential of bacteria in-
volved in these outbreaks. Our results suggest the persistence of a local S. sonnei
SDi/SJo clone in California since at least 2008. Recently, a derivative of the original
clone acquired the ability to produce Shiga toxin (STX) via exchanges of bacterio-
phages with other bacteria. STX production is connected with more severe disease,
including bloody diarrhea. A second population of S. sonnei that caused an outbreak
in the San Francisco area was resistant to fluoroquinolones and showed evidence of
connection to a fluoroquinolone-resistant lineage from South Asia. These emerging
trends in S. sonnei populations in California must be monitored for future risks of
the spread of increasingly virulent and resistant clones.

 S
higellosis is an acute gastrointestinal infection caused by bacteria belonging to the
genus Shigella. Shigellosis is the third most common enteric bacterial infection in
the United States with 500,000 infections, 6,000 hospitalizations, and 70 deaths each
year (1). There are four Shigella species that cause shigellosis: Shigella dysenteriae,
S. flexneri, S. boydii, and S. sonnei (2). S. dysenteriae is considered to be the most virulent
species, particularly S. dysenteriae type 1 serotype due to its ability to produce a potent
cytotoxin called Shiga toxin (STX). S. flexneri, S. boydii, and S. sonnei generally do not
produce Shiga toxin and, therefore, cause mild forms of shigellosis (2, 3). Shiga toxins
can also be produced by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). Two types of STX
are known in STEC: STX 1 which differs by a single amino acid from STX in S. dysenteriae
type 1, and STX 2 which shares only about 55% amino acid similarity with STX 1 (4). STX
operons for both type 1 and 2 STX consist of the stxA and stxB subunit genes, which
encode the AB5 holotoxin (5). Rarely, Shiga toxin stx genes can be transferred to
non-STX-producing S. flexneri and S. sonnei by means of a lambdoid bacteriophage
either from STEC or S. dysenteriae (3, 6, 7), providing those strains with the ability to
cause more severe disease. Infections caused by bacterial species that produce STX
often lead to hemorrhagic colitis and may cause serious complications, like hemolytic-
uremic syndrome (HUS) (8). The epidemiology of different Shigella species also varies.
S. flexneri is most common in developing countries (9), while S. sonnei is most common
in developed countries (10, 11). S. dysenteriae is least common in the developed
countries; however, it is often a cause of outbreaks in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia
(12). Infections caused by S. boydii are relatively uncommon worldwide (12). There is an
emerging global trend of S. sonnei replacing S. flexneri in areas of developing countries
undergoing economic growth and improvement in sanitation, such as Vietnam (13),
and Bangladesh (14).
S. sonnei has caused two large outbreaks in California (CA) in 2014 and 2015. The first
outbreak with distinct clusters in the San Diego and San Joaquin (SDi/SJo) areas was
caused by STX-producing isolates (15). Another CA S. sonnei outbreak occurred within
the same time frame as the two clusters described above, but it was caused by an
STX-negative S. sonnei strain and was confined primarily to the San Francisco (SFr) Bay
area (16). We performed whole-genome sequencing and antibiotic susceptibility test-
ing of 68 outbreak and archival isolates to gain further insights into the microbiological
factors associated with these shigellosis outbreaks. We examined the phylogeny of local
S. sonnei isolates and also performed comparison of CA isolates with global S. sonnei
clones. The results provided new insight into the likely origin of current CA S. sonnei
isolates and evolutionary changes under way, as they acquire more virulence.
RESULTS
In silico MLST. The sequences of seven housekeeping genes were extracted from
genomic sequences from all isolates, and their allele numbers were identified using the
Center for Genomic Epidemiology (CGE) multilocus sequence typing (MLST) database
(17). The sequence type (ST) was assigned to each isolate based on the combination of
identified alleles. All outbreak and archival California (CA) S. sonnei isolates had identical
sequences for seven MLST loci and were assigned to the same sequence type, sequence
type 152 (ST152), with the exception of one historical isolate C97 identified as ST1502.
ST1502 differs from ST152 by a single allele. S. sonnei ST152 was previously found in
Germany in 1997 and China in 2009 (18).
High-quality SNP analysis. Based on genome-wide single nucleotide polymor-
phism (SNP) analysis, which is expected to provide better resolution of lineages than
MLST, the current and archival isolates from California clustered into several clades
(Fig. 1A). For genome-wide SNP analysis, high-quality SNPs (with coverage of �5�,
minimum quality of �200, and minimum genotype quality of 10) were called against
the reference in both coding and noncoding areas throughout the whole genome. All
STX-positive isolates from two recent outbreak-related San Diego (SDi) and San Joaquin
(SJo) epidemiological groups clustered together and differed from each other by 0 to
11 SNPs. The member of SDi epidemiological group C24 had 0 SNP differences with

 several SJo isolates (C101, C114 to C119, C122, C123, C125, C128, and C129), indicating
direct relatedness of the isolates from the SDi and SJo epidemiological clusters. The
only STX-negative isolate C130 from SJo had 48 SNP differences from the closest
member of the STX-positive SDi/SJo group.
Isolates from the contemporary outbreak in San Francisco (SFr) formed a separate
cluster (Fig. 1A) and had more SNP differences with the SDi/SJo cluster (251 SNPs) than
with the historical isolate C96 from Contra Costa County, isolated in 1990 (219 SNPs).
Isolate C42 from Santa Clara County (2014) was assigned to the SFr outbreak based on
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) (see Data Set S1, sheet 1, in the supplemental
material), but differed by 62 SNPs from the closest SFr outbreak member. Isolate C42
clustered closer to the SFr outbreak than to any other contemporary or historical
isolate; therefore, it was considered to be a part of the SFr population.
The majority of historical isolates were genetically distinct from recent isolates
except for isolate C84 from Imperial County (2008), which differed by 32 SNPs from the
closest member of the SDi/SJo STX-positive cluster and by 28 SNPs from STX-negative
SJo isolate C130. This is a surprisingly small number of SNPs, compared with the
distance between the SDi/SJo cluster and other historical isolates (100 to 1,474 SNPs)
or even to the contemporary SFr outbreak cluster (251 SNPs).

 Global phylogeny of CA S. sonnei isolates. The genomes of CA S. sonnei isolates
were compared with the genomes of global S. sonnei clones reported by previous
studies (see Data Set S1, sheet 2, in the supplemental material) (19–21) using genome-
wide SNP analysis. The isolates from the aforementioned studies (188 total) were
selected based on following criteria: (i) to represent all lineages as per Holt et al. (19),
(ii) different clades described by authors (Global III, Central Asia III), and (iii) various
ciprofloxacin resistance mutations. The clustering of global strains in our analysis
showed the same lineage patterns as in the original publications (Fig. S1). The current
S. sonnei populations and the majority of the historical CA isolates (1986 to 2008)
clustered with lineage III strains. All SDi/SJo population isolates as well as historical
isolates C96, C98, and C84 (from 1990, 2007, and 2008, respectively) and recent
STX-negative SDi isolate C130, clustered together with the Global III lineage. SDi/SJo
clustered together with the historical isolate C84 from 2008 and the recent STX-
negative C130 isolate, which were closely related and most likely represent a single
introduction event dating back prior to 2008.
Interestingly, historical isolate C98 from 2007 carrying fluoroquinolone (FQ) resis-
tance mutation GyrA-83L clustered with a group of five genomes from Korea isolated
between 1998 and 2003 carrying the same GyrA-83L mutation (19), which is not
common within Global III lineage, suggesting a possible introduction route for the CA
isolate from Korea in the past.
All ciprofloxacin-resistant S. sonnei isolates from the SFr outbreak with a triple
mutation GyrA-83L GyrA-87G ParC-80I, clustered closely with the South Asia-Southeast
Asia clade of isolates possessing the same type of FQ resistance mutation.
Another distinct clade within lineage III was formed by an isolate from Mexico (1998)
and a group of historical CA S. sonnei isolates obtained between 1986 and 2002. Three
CA isolates from 1980 to 1987 clustered together with lineage II. A single historical
isolate C97, with a unique MLST pattern ST1502, was grouped with lineage I strains. No
lineage IV isolates were found in California (Fig. 1A; see Fig. S1 in the supplemental
material).
COG and Pfam clustering of CA S. sonnei genomes. Hierarchical clustering
based on the COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins) and Pfam (protein
domain) profiles was used as an alternative method to examine relatedness of CA
S. sonnei strains with other S. sonnei genomes in the Joint Genome Institute (JGI)
Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) database and their phylogenetic position in
relation to other Shigella species and Escherichia coli strains from the same database.
This protein family profile clustering was carried out with representative genomes of CA
S. sonnei isolates (isolates C7, 113, and C123 for the SDi/SJo population, isolate C39 for
the SFr population, and isolates C84, C88, and C97 for historical isolates). We included
all available Shigella genomes and all E. coli isolates that had a defined serovar in the
JGI IMG database into the whole-genome comparison by Pfam and COG. Two different
clustering methods were used: one based on the abundance and absence and the
other based only on the presence/absence of both COG and Pfam groups.
The approach based on COG abundance showed all CA S. sonnei isolates clustering
together with E. coli and separate from other S. sonnei isolates, with the exception of
S. sonnei strain 1DT-1, which also clustered with E. coli (see Fig. S2A in the supplemental
material). Similar results were seen in the hierarchical clustering based on Pfam
abundance profiles (Fig. S2B). Except in the Pfam clustering, two CA S. sonnei isolates
(one of the historical isolates and one San Francisco isolate) clustered with other
S. sonnei isolates from the database, while all other CA isolates clustered with E. coli, as
previously.
To determine whether specific parts of genome were shared between CA S. sonnei
and E. coli isolates and contributed to CA S. sonnei clustering with E. coli, we searched
for the genes in the genome of CA S. sonnei that had homologs in either of two E. coli
genomes which clustered closest to the CA S. sonnei on the COG tree (E. coli O104:H4
strain H112180541 and E. coli O139:H28 strain E24377A), but not in other S. sonnei

 isolates from the database (except for S. sonnei strain 1DT-1). The various genes
(content and number) were found to be shared between either the E. coli strains and
CA S. sonnei isolates, regardless of the presence of the STX bacteriophage in the latter
case (see Data Set S1, sheet 3, in the supplemental material). When we searched for the
genes that were common in all CA S. sonnei isolates and in one of the two closest E. coli
strains, none were found. Thus, it was impossible to attribute the clustering of CA
S. sonnei isolates with E. coli strains to the specific shared genes.
We also performed a recombination test on alignment of genome-wide high-quality
SNPs (hqSNPs) using the Recombination Detection Program version 4 (RDP4) (22). None
of the recombination detection algorithms included in the software package used
detected recombination events between CA S. sonnei and E. coli.
To compare phylogenetic position of CA S. sonnei isolates in relation to other
Shigella and E. coli species based on their nucleotide sequences, a phylogenetic tree of
genomes was constructed from a concatenation of a set of 37 core phylogenetic marker
genes using Phylosift (see Fig. S2C in the supplemental material) (23). We selected
representative E. coli and Shigella species isolates from IMG JGI and NCBI databases
sufficient to demonstrate clustering of CA isolates with one or another species and not
attempting to show the phylogeny within each species. In this tree, all S. sonnei isolates,
including CA S. sonnei isolates, grouped together, and separate from E. coli with one
exception—S. sonnei strain 1DT-1 (which grouped in a clade with E. coli). Both nucle-
otide (Fig. S2C) and amino acid sequence (data not shown) trees generated with
Phylosift showed the same result. Whole-genome clustering based on genome-wide
SNPs in both coding and noncoding areas of the genome (Fig. S2D) supported the
results of Phylosift: all S. sonnei isolates, including ones from California, clustered
together, except for S. sonnei 1DT-1.
The difference between protein family profile clustering and concatenated marker
gene phylogeny is striking. In the protein family profile clustering, CA S. sonnei isolates
grouped with E. coli rather than with other S. sonnei, but in the concatenated marker
gene phylogeny, CA S. sonnei and E. coli did not group together. Closer examination of
some of the results led us to consider the possibility that the observed contrast was an
artifact of analysis. Upon further review, we found that CA isolates and S. sonnei strain
1DT-1 similar to E. coli, particularly serotype O104:H4, had low gene counts for several
transposases (COG2963, COG2801, COG3547, COG3335, COG4584, and COG3385) and
a DNA replication protein DnaC (COG1484), while other Shigella species isolates in the
database had those genes in abundance (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). This
indicated that a few transposable elements skewed the clustering of CA S. sonnei
toward E. coli. When only the presence/absence of the COG and Pfam elements was
taken into account, COG- and Pfam-based clustering appeared to be congruent with
nucleotide phylogeny: CA S. sonnei isolates clustered with other S. sonnei strains in the
database (Fig. 2; Fig. S4). Therefore, we would like to emphasize that genome clustering
based on gene abundance is prone to the issues described above and should not be
used to infer phylogenies.
STX-encoding bacteriophage from CA S. sonnei isolates. All isolates from the
SDi/SJo outbreak possessed STX-1 subunit A and B genes (stx1A and stx1B) (Fig. 3).
Shiga toxin production by SDi/SJo isolates harboring stx1 genes was confirmed in Vero
cell neutralization assay. The data were presented in an earlier publication by Lamba et
al. (15). None of the historical isolates or recent isolates related to the San Francisco
outbreak had stx genes. The STX in the SDi/SJo population was encoded by a gene on
a novel lambdoid bacteriophage. This 62.4-kb bacteriophage had identical sequence
and was integrated into a chromosomal wrbA site in all SDi/SJo STX-positive isolates.
The phage Ss-VASD isolated in California in 2016 from two S. sonnei isolates potentially
related to the SDi/SJo outbreak cluster (24) was identical based on a BLASTn search to
the bacteriophage characterized here. Due to unavailability of the isolates’ genome
sequences, their relatedness to the outbreak cluster was impossible to confirm. A
modern STX-negative S. sonnei isolate C130 from SJo had an intact wrbA site; therefore,

 we conclude that it represents a lineage sharing the STX-negative ancestor with the
SDi/SJo population.
In order to better understand the origin of the novel STX phage in the SDi/SJo
S. sonnei population, we carried out a series of comparative analyses. First, the Phage
Search Tool (PHAST) revealed that the best match for the novel CA STX1 phage was the
STX2-encoding P13374 phage found in STEC O104:H4, a strain that caused a large
outbreak in Germany and other European countries in 2011 (25). The similarity of CA
STX1 phage to STX phage from E. coli O104:H4 was supported by a BLASTn search,
which revealed very high similarity with Stx2-encoding phages from E. coli O104:H4
strains 2009EL-2050 (CP003297.1) and 2009EL-2071 (CP003301.1) from Georgia in 2009
(25) with 98% shared identity at 92% query length. The bacteriophage from the CA
isolates was also very similar to two phages found in strains from the European E. coli
O104:H4 outbreak (P13374 phage [NC_018846]) with 97% identity for 88% of the query
search coverage and the phage in E. coli strain 2011C-3493 (CP003289.1) with 97%

 nei phage 75/02_Stx from Hungary (KF766125.2) was also shown to share large colinear
regions with STX2 prophages from E. coli O104:H4 and O157:H7 (5). However, the
Hungarian phage only partially resembled CA STX1 phage with 99% of shared identity
at 62% query coverage. Among other top BLASTn hits (�97% identity [ID] and �90%
query) were German E. coli HUSEC/EHEC (HUSEC stands for enterohemorrhagic E. coli
[EHEC] associated with hemolytic-uremic syndrome [HUS]) epidemic isolate HUSEC2011
(HF572917.2) with 97% identity over 93% of the query, stx2-positive E. coli O168 strain
09-00049 from United States in 2009 (CP015228) with 97% ID/93% query, and another
German outbreak E. coli O104:H4 strain C227-11 (CP011331.1) with 97% ID/92% query.
The distance tree of the top BLASTn nucleotide sequences matches to the CA STX1
phage can be found in Fig. S5 in the supplemental material. The BLASTn distance tree
was generated using all of the top hits regardless of species which had query cover of
�70%, in addition to that, top hits among Shigella spp. with at least 30% query cover,
and phages from E. coli O157:H7 strains Sakai and EDL933 were included in the
comparison. This selection of phage sequences was further compared by several
methods as described below.
In order to better understand the phylogenetic relatedness of CA STX1 phage to
other phages identified as top matches by BLASTn, we generated a phylogenetic tree
of integrase genes. This revealed that the CA STX1 phage grouped evolutionarily with
other STX-encoding E. coli phages, particularly with phages from non-O157 E. coli, but
not with ones from Shigella species (see Fig. S6A in the supplemental material).
Figure S7A shows the phylogeny based on integrase amino acid sequences; similar
results were seen with nucleotide-based trees (not shown). This integrase phylogenetic
analysis confirmed the relatedness of the CA STX1 phage to the phage found in E. coli
O104:H4 from Georgia in 2009 and in pandemic E. coli O104:H4 from Germany in 2011,
while it also showed similarity with two STX phages from E. coli O168:H8 isolated in the
United States in 2009. It has been demonstrated previously that phage phylogeny
should be inferred from a combination of protein repertoires and phage architecture
rather than from a single gene (e.g., integrase) sequence (26, 27). The mosaic structure
of the lambdoid phages poses a limitation for such single-locus phylogeny approach.
For this reason, in addition to integrase phylogeny, we estimated full-phage-sequence
phylogeny via multiple alignments of complete nucleotide sequences of the phages
(Fig. S6B). The phylogeny based on complete phage sequences showed that phages
from E. coli O104:H4 strains 2009EL-2050 and 2009EL-2071 from Georgia isolated in
2009 were the closest to the CA STX1 phage. The CA STX1 phage was also closely
related to phages from other E. coli O104:H4 strains, including phage P13374 implicated
in the German outbreak of 2011, and to the phage from STEC O2:H27 previously shown
as highly similar to the German phage (25). To a lesser extent, the CA STX1 phage
showed similarity to other phages from non-O157 strains (O168, O103, O111, and O26).
STX phages from O157 strains of E. coli and other Shigella species were genetically
distinct from the CA STX1 phage.
We also used progressiveMauve to make whole-phage alignments. This revealed
that the STX1 phage in CA isolates more closely resembled the STX2-coding phages in
non-O157 E. coli than phages in O157 E. coli or Shigella species (Fig. 4A and B). The
STX2-encoding phage P13374 from German outbreak E. coli O104:H4 strain, as well as
related phages P13363 and phiON, were the closest to the CA STX1 phage according
to the neighbor-joining tree built based on the estimate of the shared gene content
from progressiveMauve alignment.
We identified in several CA isolates the bacteriophages known to be associated with
STX but that were missing actual stx genes. According to PHAST output, isolate C7
possessed an intact STX2-converting phage 1717 (NC_011357), isolate C113 had an
incomplete STX2-converting phage 86 (NC_008464), and isolate C16 harbored a ques-
tionable STX2-converting phage I (NC_003525), while none of them contained the stx
gene sequence (see Fig. S7 in the supplemental material). We propose gain and loss stx
genes during the evolution of S. sonnei in California.

 STX holotoxin and other virulence determinants in CA S. sonnei isolates.
Even though the phage from E. coli O104:H4 STEC was identified as the most closely
related to the CA STX1 phage, it carried the stx2 gene, while the CA phage carried the
gene encoding the STX1 toxin. The STX operon in CA isolates (holotoxin genes stx1A
and stx1B) was identical to STX operons in S. flexneri phage POCJ13 (KJ603229.1) and
several S. dysenteriae strains, including S. dysenteriae type 1 (M19437.1), but differed
from STX operon in the majority of E. coli strains. The CA S. sonnei STX operon had 1 SNP
difference with other STX1-encoding S. sonnei bacteriophages (accession nos.
KF766125.2 and AJ132761.1). The similarity of different regions of the CA STX1 phage
to various phages can be explained by the mosaic structure of STX lambdoid
phages due to frequent recombinations and modular exchange with other lamb-
doid phages (28). Moreover, there is evidence that it could be quite common for
lambdoid phages of S. sonnei to have stx genes from S. dysenteriae and the rest of the
phage genes resembling the STEC or EHEC E. coli strains (3, 5).
Besides STX, the following virulence genes were detected in S. sonnei from Califor-
nia: Shigella IgA-like protease homolog (sigA), glutamate decarboxylase (gad), plasmid-
encoded enterotoxin (senB), P-related fimbria regulatory gene (prfB), long polar fim-
briae (lpfA), endonuclease colicin E2 (celb), invasion protein S. flexneri (ipaD), VirF
transcriptional activator (virF), and increased serum survival gene (iss). The distribution
of these virulence genes in different S. sonnei populations from California is presented
in Fig. 3. The increased serum survival virulence gene iss was mainly found in the
SDi/SJo population of isolates found more recently, and in a single historical isolate
from 1980; however, the iss alleles in modern and historical isolates were different.
Antimicrobial resistance of CA S. sonnei isolates. Acquired antibiotic resistance
(ABR) markers to the following classes of antimicrobials were identified: beta-lactams
(blaTEM-1 and blaOXA-2 genes), aminoglycosides [aph(3[dprime])-Ib, aph(6)-Id, aac(3)-IId,
aadA1, and aadA2], macrolides (mphA), sulfonamides (sul1 and sul2), phenicols (catA1),
trimethoprim (dfrA1, dfrA8, and dfrA12), and tetracycline (tetA and tetB) (Fig. 5). The
majority of the isolates were phenotypically resistant to aminoglycosides, sulfonamides,
trimethoprim, and tetracycline. In addition, a phenotypic resistance to penicillins
mediated by TEM-1 �-lactamase gene occurred in 16 isolates. The correlation between
the genotype and susceptibility phenotype is presented in Data Set S1, sheet 4, in the
supplemental material. In 100% of cases, the presence of antibiotic resistance deter-
minants correlated with the expected nonsusceptible phenotype. In 7% of cases, the
isolates without known antibiotic resistance genes appeared to be nonsusceptible
(Data Set S1, sheet 4), suggesting the presence of resistance mechanisms, like the loss
of porins and increased efflux (29), which are not included in the ResFinder database.
For example, two isolates showed intermediate susceptibility to streptomycin, and 15
isolates were nonsusceptible to ampicillin and sulbactam in the absence of the genes
which would explain the corresponding resistance phenotypes in those isolates.
Among the tetracycline-resistant isolates, 3.3% (n � 2) of isolates did not possess any
known tetracycline resistance genes, while 86.9% (n � 53) had a truncated version of
the tet(A) gene (1,172 bp versus 1,200 bp for the full-length reference sequence from
the ResFinder database). Nonetheless, the isolates without tetracyclin resistance genes
or with incomplete tet(A) gene demonstrated a high level of resistance to tetracycline
(MIC � 8 �g/ml). This suggests the presence of additional mechanisms of resistance
that were not detected in the ResFinder database.
Acquired ABR genes were frequently associated with various mobile elements.
Penicillin resistance encoded on the blaTEM-1 gene was associated with Tn3 transposon
located on conjugative plasmids of the IncB/O/K/Z incompatibility group found in both
recent SFr and historical isolates (see Fig. S8A in the supplemental material) or on the
putative IncI1 plasmid in several modern SJo isolates (Fig. S8B). Partial plasmid se-
quences were identified in historical isolates as IncB/O/K/Z and contained plasmid
backbone genes encoding the following products: transcriptional activator RfaH, plas-
mid stabilization system protein, ribbon-helix-helix protein CopG, replication initiation
protein RepA, and plasmid conjugative transfer protein. These partial IncB/O/K/Z

 plasmid sequences in historical isolates matched the analogous area in IncB/O/K/Z
plasmids of recent isolates, suggesting their relatedness to each other. An identical
genetic element Tn3::blaTEM-1 was integrated into different loci of the IncB/O/K/Z
plasmids in historical isolates in comparison with integration locus in IncB/O/K/Z
plasmids of modern San Francisco cluster isolates, which suggests that dissemination of
the blaTEM-1 gene is associated with the transfer via Tn3 (Fig. S8A).
Aminoglycoside and trimethoprim resistance genes were often linked with Tn7
transposon (see Fig. S8C in the supplemental material). A genetic region, containing an
association of Tn7 with aadA1 and dfrA1 ABR genes, as well as TDP-fucosamine
acetyltransferase, and a partial sequence of tyrosine recombinase XerC/D were identical
in recent SJo isolates and two historical samples C99 and C92, isolated in Shasta County
in 2000 and Imperial County in 2002, respectively. However, the area upstream of
Tn7 in novel isolates showed evidence of later integration of an additional Tn7 element,
leading to the loss or modification of the area containing tetracycline resistance genes
found in historical isolates.
One of the historical isolates C80 (Orange County, 1987) was resistant to azithro-
mycin and possessed macrolide resistance gene mphA, found in association with Tn7
transposon on a contig which also encoded trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and
aminoglycoside resistance, multidrug transporter EmrE, and a mercuric resistance
operon (see Fig. S8D in the supplemental material). Resistance to azithromycin is
emerging in the United States (30), and the presence of an azithromycin resistance
gene in one of the isolates dating back to 1987 is remarkable.

 Fluoroquinolone resistance. All modern isolates from the SDi/SJo population
and historical S. sonnei isolates were susceptible to fluoroquinolones (FQ); however, few
historical isolates possessed several types of point mutations leading to amino acid
substitutions in the genes encoding FQ targets, such as the A subunit of DNA gyrase
(GyrA) and the C subunit of topoisomerase IV (ParC) (Fig. 5; see Data Set S1, sheet 4, in
the supplemental material). The quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) (31)
of the GyrA in two CA historical isolates had a single amino acid substitution S83L.
S. sonnei isolates with single mutation GyrA-S83L have been previously reported to
exhibit high MICs for quinolones (nalidixic acid) but low MICs for fluoroquinolones (MIC
range of ciprofloxacin, 0.125 to 0.25 �g/ml) (32). In agreement with previous data,
historical CA S. sonnei isolates with single mutation GyrA-S83L remained phenotypically
susceptible to ciprofloxacin with wild-type MIC values of �0.5 �g/ml. Two FQ-
susceptible historical isolates had a single point mutation V533A in the ParC, and one
FQ-susceptible isolate had a combination of ParC-V533A and GyrA-D483E mutations;
none of the mutations were located in the QRDRs of corresponding proteins and were
not associated with a resistant phenotype.
In contrast, all SFr population isolates implicated in the outbreak expressed high-
level FQ resistance. All isolates from the contemporary San Francisco outbreak had a
combination of point mutations S83L and D87G in QRDR GyrA and substitution S80I in
QRDR ParC, which caused a significant increase in ciprofloxacin MIC to �4 �g/ml (see
Data Set S1, sheet 4, in the supplemental material). The modern nonoutbreak isolate
C42 was phenotypically susceptible to FQ and possessed a single QRDR GyrA mutation
S83L (Fig. 5), which represents a prerequisite mutation allowing for one-step develop-
ment of high-level FQ resistance if combined with another QRDR mutation (33).
DISCUSSION
The key results of our study were as follows: (i) the first large-scale whole-genome
analysis of S. sonnei strains from North America; (ii) the delineation of two distinct
populations of S. sonnei that caused large outbreaks of shigellosis in California (SDi/SJo
population and SFr population); (iii) linkage of SDi/SJo population to an older lineage
of S. sonnei documented in California as early as 2008; (iv) evidence of STX1-encoding
bacteriophage in the SDi/SJo population related to the phages from E. coli O104:H4,
including a pandemic strain from Germany with the STX operon identical to those in
S. flexneri and S. dysenteriae; (v) connection of the SFr population to an FQ-resistant
clade that originated in South Asia; (vi) evidence of fluoroquinolone resistance in the
SFr population mediated by the chromosomal mutations in the genes of antibiotic
targets GyrA and ParC.
According to the whole-genome hqSNP phylogeny, the isolates from outbreaks in
2014 to 2015 were divided into two distinct populations—SDi/SJo and SFr. SDi and SJo
isolates constituted the same outbreak population, which was incongruent with two
separate clusters identified by PFGE (15). Many recent publications have highlighted
superior discriminatory power and predictive value of whole-genome sequencing
(WGS) over PFGE for genotyping of bacterial strains (34).
Comparison to global S. sonnei clones placed both modern SDi/SJo and SFr popu-
lations as well as the majority of historical CA S. sonnei isolates dating back as far as
1986 into the lineage III defined by Holt et al. (19) (Fig. 1A; see Fig. S1 in the
supplemental material). All STX-positive SDi/SJo isolates clustered with Global III clade
defined by Holt et al. within lineage III, which was shown to be particularly successful
at global expansion (19). Remarkably, the isolates from the SDi/SJo population did not
cluster with geographically proximate isolates from Mexico, which was related to only
a few historical CA isolates, suggesting that the strain exchange with Mexico had
happened in the past, but is unlikely to be a source of recent introduction of STX-
producing S. sonnei into California. According to the Holt et al. hypothesis, all original
S. sonnei lineages diversified from Europe and then were introduced to other countries
where they underwent localized clonal expansions (19). Our findings suggest that the
lineage ancestral to the current SDi/SJo S. sonnei population was introduced as early as

 2008 and diversified within California. The data suggest that the acquisition of the stx1
gene happened after the introduced Global III lineage S. sonnei clone had already
spread in California. The contemporary C130 and historical C84 STX-negative S. sonnei
isolates, which both clustered with STX-positive SDi/SJo outbreak isolates, most likely
represent the closest lineage to an ancestral STX-negative strain from which the SDi/SJo
population evolved by acquisition of the STX bacteriophage.
All ciprofloxacin-resistant S. sonnei isolates from the SFr population showed close
clustering with the South Asia-Southeast Asia clade of FQ-resistant isolates. South Asia
has been shown to serve as a hub for dissemination of FQ-resistant S. sonnei clones
around the globe (20), and our data suggest that the CA FQ-resistant SFr population
also originated from the South Asian clade. Considering that no patients from the SFr
outbreak cluster reported international travel (16), the introduced resistant clone could
have been circulating locally prior to involvement in the outbreak. Unlike some of the
other U.S. isolates deposited as a part of GenomeTrakr project, CA isolates did not
cluster with European FQ-resistant isolates and likely represent a direct introduction
event. As S. sonnei is becoming more common in developing countries (13, 14), as in
many of the countries in South and Southeast Asia, it could further increase the risk of
clonal expansion and global dissemination of FQ-resistant strains of S. sonnei.
It also appears that global S. sonnei clones belonging to lineages I, II, and III were
introduced into California independently during the last 3 decades.
All recent S. sonnei outbreak isolates as well as all but one historical isolate belonged
to ST152. This long-term persistence of a single clone in California over 3 decades is
remarkable, and it could indicate that ST152 is a very successful S. sonnei clone. There
were previous examples when the same sequence types persisted in the same geo-
graphical area for a long time, e.g., ST245 in China was found in 1983 as well as 26 years
later in 2009 (18). This phenomenon, however, is most likely explained by a low
resolution of MLST for subtyping of clonal S. sonnei population, which has been noted
before (35).
Isolates from the SDi/SJo S. sonnei population, which caused outbreak of severe
diarrheal disease (15), carried stx1 genes carried on a novel lambdoid bacteriophage in
all of the isolates. The strains of E. coli O104:H4 serotype appeared to be the most likely
source of the STX bacteriophage in SDi/SJo S. sonnei isolates based on overall similarity
of their whole-phage sequences. Specifically, the STX2 phage from E. coli O104:H4
strain isolated in Georgia in 2009 was found to be the closest known relative to CA STX1
phage. This Georgian strain was previously shown to share a common ancestry with
E. coli O104:H4 strain implicated in an outbreak in Germany and other European
countries in 2011 (36), one of the world’s largest outbreaks of food-borne disease in
humans with 855 cases of hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) and 53 fatalities (37, 38).
It has been also suggested that the STX bacteriophage found in Georgian isolates
resided in the common ancestor of Georgian and German outbreak strains (36). It is
possible that CA S. sonnei received the STX bacteriophage from E. coli O104:H4 strain
related to Georgian isolates or from the strain that served as a parent to the Georgian
and German outbreak strains. The STX phage from E. coli O104:H4 has overcome
recombination of the STX2 operon to yield the final phage with general architecture of
E. coli phage and STX1 operon from S. flexneri or S. dysenteriae.
STX1-encoding bacteriophage was not found in the contemporary isolate C130 even
though it was closely related to SDi/SJo S. sonnei population. It is possible that the
bacterial population as a whole acquired the STX1-encoding bacteriophage more
recently and concurrently. Such a scenario would also suggest that the increase in
virulence can occur either by the spread of STX-positive clones or by the horizontal
transfer of stx1 genes by bacteriophages. The potential of bacteriophages to transfer
STX genes from one S. sonnei strain to another has been described previously (3). Not
all the S. sonnei strains have a suitable genetic background to be able to express STX
efficiently (39). The modern STX-positive SDi/SJo population of S. sonnei was shown to
be able to express STX (15) and thus has been proven to possess the genetic back-
ground that is adapted for increased virulence. The adaptation of SDi/SJo S. sonnei

 genomic background to retain and express STX stably by itself is a prerequisite for
future emergence of more virulent strains in California. Another example of SDi/SJo
population increasing its virulence is the acquisition of the increased serum survival
virulence gene iss, which occurred seemingly recently in the evolution of the SDi/SJo
S. sonnei clone. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the increased serum survival
determinant (iss) being found in Shigella species.
Even though the treatment of infection caused by S. sonnei with antibiotics is not a
standard procedure, it is indicated for the treatment of severe cases in order to reduce
duration of symptoms (40). Antibiotic resistance (AR) of S. sonnei is, however, on the rise
(16, 41, 42). This highlights the importance of ABR monitoring in S. sonnei populations.
We detected resistance markers to multiple classes of antimicrobials in CA S. sonnei. For
example, 91.2% of modern isolates and 81.8% of historical isolates were multidrug
resistant (MDR) according to the definition of MDR microorganisms as demonstrating
“non-susceptibility to at least one agent in three or more antimicrobial categories” (43).
Acquired ABR genes in CA S. sonnei were frequently associated with various mobile
elements and conjugative plasmids, likely contributing to their dissemination. For
example, MDR transposon Tn7 has been shown to be a crucial part of ABR evolution in
the local populations of S. sonnei lineage III (19). Once acquired, ABR genes tend to stay
in the bacterial population, e.g., traditional antibiotics like co-trimoxazole and tetracy-
cline are no longer in use for patient treatment (18), but the ABR genes persist in the
modern SDi/SJo and SFr populations of the CA S. sonnei. Due to excessive veterinary
use of antibiotics, farm animals were known to be a significant contributor of antibiotic
resistance in enteric pathogens (44), like S. sonnei. Therefore, the development and
persistence of multidrug resistance in CA S. sonnei could be attributed to the possible
circulation of the pathogen in an animal host. However, since no point source or
common exposures were identified for either SFr (16) or SDi/SJo (15) outbreaks, it is
difficult to determine the conditions leading to the evolution of the strains. The
multiple secondary cases of SDi/SJo outbreak caused by person-to-person transmission
(15) and extended duration of the outbreak raised the possibility of lengthy circulation
of CA S. sonnei in the human population.
Particularly worrisome was the detection of FQ resistance in all of the isolates
belonging to a modern SFr S. sonnei population implicated in the outbreak. FQ
resistance in all SFr outbreak isolates was mediated by a combination of double
mutations in the QRDR GyrA of DNA gyrase and one mutation in QRDR ParC of
topoisomerase IV. All historical isolates and all other modern isolates were susceptible
to FQ; however, few of those phenotypically susceptible CA S. sonnei isolates possessed
a prerequisite single amino acid substitution in QRDR of the GyrA, including two
isolates belonging to CA lineage III: one historical isolate from 2007 and one modern
nonoutbreak isolate belonging to the SFr population. Single mutations in QRDR GyrA
were shown previously to confer a low level of FQ resistance and to serve a prerequisite
for further resistance escalation via stepwise mutation acquisition (33). Therefore,
emergence and dissemination of such low-FQ-resistance strains should be a concern for
public health authorities.
We acknowledge certain limitations of this study. The temporal and spatial repre-
sentation was sporadic in S. sonnei strains in our culture collection. We also recognize
that the short-read sequencing by synthesis used to generate data might limit com-
plete assembly of S. sonnei genomes and enumeration of genome-wide SNPs. No
plasmid transformation followed by resequencing could be performed to confirm
postulated genetic exchanges among S. sonnei populations.
Although the direct experimental evidence is lacking, Shiga toxin production and
other virulence elements discovered in the SDi/SJo population appeared to be among
the contributors that lead to serious manifestations of gastrointestinal disease in the CA
shigellosis outbreak, including bloody diarrhea in 71% of patients (15). Fortunately,
there were no fatalities and none of the affected patients developed the more-serious
HUS. One potential clue to the absence of severe manifestations could be that Shiga
toxin-positive S. sonnei strains contained STX1. The toxins encoded by STX1 and STX2

 are known to elicit variable pathology among affected individuals. A number of
investigators have demonstrated that E. coli O157 Shiga toxin-producing strains
carrying STX2 caused more-severe disease, including HUS, than STX1-positive
strains (45–47).
Conclusions. Two distinct populations of S. sonnei (SDi/SJo and SFr) were delin-
eated in the recent shigellosis outbreaks in California. The SDi/SJo population evolved
from a lineage of S. sonnei likely present in California as early as 2008. The suggested
evolutionary pathway of the SDi/SJo population was enhanced virulence via acquisition
of a phage from the E. coli O104:H4 strain and STX operon from S. flexneri or S. dysen-
teriae. Close relatedness of the fluoroquinolone-resistant SFr population to the S. sonnei
clade from South and Southeast Asia harboring mutations in the gyrA and parC genes
suggested the possibility of foreign introduction of this clone into California. Thus, the
recent outbreak S. sonnei strains in California are characterized by (i) acquisition of
increased virulence by a local clone and (ii) introduction of a fluoroquinolone-resistant
clone from abroad. Both trends are of a concern to public health authorities and call for
enhanced surveillance and early detection of future shigellosis outbreaks.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Isolates. Sixty-eight Shigella sonnei human isolates from California (CA) (57 outbreak-related isolates
from 2014 to 2015 and 11 archival isolates from 1980 to 2008), were identified and serotyped by standard
methods (48) (see Data Set S1, sheet 1, in the supplemental material). PCR detection of the stx1 and stx2
genes and Vero cell neutralization assay for confirmation of STX production were performed as
previously described (49). A map with geographical distribution of the locations of origin of the isolates
is shown in Fig. 1B.
Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and data analysis. DNA was extracted with a Wizard Genomic
DNA kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Sequencing libraries were constructed using the Nextera XT (Illumina
Inc., San Diego, CA) library preparation kit. Sequencing was performed using 2 � 300-bp sequencing
chemistry on an Illumina MiSeq sequencer per the manufacturer’s instructions. Adapter trimming and
demultiplexing were performed using MiSeq Reporter software. Prior to data analysis, all reads were
quality trimmed to remove all ambiguous nucleotides and sequences with a Phred score of �30, and to
discard all reads of �40 bp using CLCbio Genomic Workbench 8.0.2 (Qiagen, Aarhus, Denmark).
High-quality single nucleotide polymorphism (hqSNP)-based phylogeny was used to determine
genetic relationships between the local California (CA) S. sonnei populations and their connection to
global S. sonnei strains. See the lists of local isolates and global strains used in the analysis in sheets 1
and 2, respectively, in Data Set S1 in the supplemental material. The details of hqSNP analysis can be
found in File S1. In general, paired-end reads were mapped to the reference genome of S. sonnei Ss046
(NC_007384.1) using CLCbio Genomic Workbench 8.0.2 (Qiagen, Aarhus, Denmark). SNPs were called in
coding and noncoding genome areas using SAMtools mpileup (v.1.2 [50]), BCFtools (v 0.1.19; http://
samtools.github.io/bcftools/), VCFtools (v.0.1.12b [51]). Only high-quality single nucleotide polymor-
phisms were included using the following criteria: coverage of �5�, minimum quality of �200,
minimum genotype quality (GQ) of 10 (–minDP 5; –minQ 200; –minGQ 10; –remove-indels), without
indels and the heterozygote calls. A phylogenetic tree was generated using CLCbio Genomic Workbench
8.0.2 (Qiagen, Aarhus, Denmark) with maximum likelihood phylogeny (under the Jukes-Cantor or general
time reversible nucleotide substitution models, as specified; with bootstrapping) based on hqSNPs.
Clustering of genomes based on COG and Pfam profiles and using Phylosift (23) was performed to
compare CA S. sonnei strains with other S. sonnei genomes found in JGI IMG database and show
phylogenetic position of CA isolates and other S. sonnei strains in relation to other Shigella species and
Escherichia coli strains in the same database.
COG- and Pfam-based identification and clustering were performed using the Department of Energy
(DOE) Joint Genome Institute (JGI) Integrated Microbial Genomes (IMG) system (https://img.jgi.doe.gov/).
The presence or absence matrices were fed to RAxML 7.3.0 (52) to produce the best tree from 50
bootstraps using the gamma model rate of heterogeneity for binary input. COG abundance profile and
gene homolog search were performed using JGI IMG tools.
Phylosift (23) was used to (i) identify 37 “universal” genes in a set of genomes (including those
generated here) and (ii) generate alignments for each gene family and then concatenate the alignments.
A phylogenetic tree was inferred from the concatenated alignments using RAxML 7.2.6. Bipartition trees
were generated using 1,000 bootstraps.
De novo assembly for each genome was done on CLCbio GW8.0.2. The assembled genomes of
S. sonnei isolates had 30� to 159� sequencing coverage. Genomes were annotated with prokka v1.1
(53), the JGI IMG database, the Center for Genomic Epidemiology (CGE) (ResFinder, VirulenceFinder,
PlasmidFinder) (54), and the Phage Search Tool (PHAST) (55) online resources. In silico multilocus
sequence typing (MLST) was performed using the CGE online tool (17) against the MLST scheme
“Escherichia coli #1” (https://cge.cbs.dtu.dk/services/MLST/) (56).
The primary search for the bacteriophage sequences similar to the CA STX1 phage was performed
using BLASTn and Phage Search Tool (PHAST). To estimate similarity between the bacteriophages,

 were generated using the progressiveMauve program (57), and in addition, the full phage sequences
were aligned using CLCbio GW8.0.2. general aligner, and a maximum likelihood tree was generated
under the Jukes-Cantor nucleotide substitution model with bootstrapping. Sequences of integrases
(both the DNA for the genes and the encoded amino acids for the proteins), derived from the sequences
of STX phages were aligned using CLCbio GW8.0.2 general aligner, and a neighbor-joining tree was
generated as described above.
Recombination test was performed on genome-wide hqSNP alignment using Recombination Detec-
tion Program version 4.67 (RDP4) (22). The following algorithms included in the RDP4 package were
applied to search for the recombination events: RDP, BOOTSCAN, GENECONV, MAXCHI, CHIMAERA,
SISCAN, 3SEQ, PHYLPRO, and VisRD. A window size of 100 and a step size of 30 were used.
Antimicrobial susceptibility and resistance testing. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of S. sonnei
isolates was performed using Microscan Dried Gram-negative panels Neg MIC 38 (Beckman Coulter, Inc.,
Brea, CA, USA); the MIC results were read and interpreted according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Streptomycin (10 �g) and azithromycin (15 �g) BBL Sensi-Discs (Becton, Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ,
USA) were used to determine susceptibility to the corresponding antimicrobials. Standard quality control
strains were tested in parallel as required in respective product inserts.
