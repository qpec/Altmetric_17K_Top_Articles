Abstract
Background: Early transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBC) has been associated with improved survival in patients
with haemorrhagic shock. This study aims to describe the characteristics of patients receiving pre-hospital blood
transfusion and evaluate their subsequent need for in-hospital transfusion and surgery.
Methods: The decision to administer a pre-hospital PRBC transfusion was based on clinical judgment. All patients
transfused pre-hospital PRBC between February 2013 and December 2014 were included. Pre-hospital and in-hospital
records were retrospectively reviewed.
Results: One hundred forty-seven patients were included. 142 patients had traumatic injuries and 5 patients had
haemorrhagic shock from a medical origin. Median Injury Severity Score was 30. 90% of patients receiving
PRBC had an ISS of >15. Patients received a mean of 2.4(±1.1) units of PRBC in the pre-hospital phase. Median time
from initial emergency call to hospital arrival was 114 min (IQR 103–140). There was significant improvement in systolic
(p < 0.001), diastolic (p < 0.001) and mean arterial pressures (p < 0.001) with PRBC transfusion but there was no
difference in HR (p = 0.961). Patients received PRBC significantly faster in the field than waiting until hospital
arrival. At the receiving hospital 57% required an urgent surgical or interventional radiology procedure. At
hospital arrival, patients had a mean lactate of 5.4(±4.4) mmol/L, pH of 6.9(±1.3) and base deficit of −8.1(±6.7). Mean
initial serum adjusted calcium was 2.26(±0.29) mmol/L. 89% received further blood products in hospital. No transfusion
complications or significant incidents occurred and 100% traceability was achieved.
Discussion: Pre-hospital transfusion of packed red cells has the potential to improvde outcome for trauma patients
with major haemorrhage. The pre-hospital time for trauma patients can be several hours, suggesting transfusion needs
to start in the pre-hospital phase. Hospital transfusion research suggests a 1:1 ratio of packed red blood cells to plasma
improves outcome and further research into pre-hospital adoption of this strategy is needed.
Conclusion: Pre-hospital PRBC transfusion significantly reduces the time to transfusion for major trauma patients with
suspected major haemorrhage. The majority of patients receiving pre-hospital PRBC were severely injured and required
further transfusion in hospital. Further research is warranted to determine which patients are most likely to have
outcome benefit from pre-hospital blood products and what triggers should be used for pre-hospital transfusion.

 Background
Haemorrhage is one of the leading causes of death in
major trauma patients [1]. Major haemorrhage is defined
as bleeding in excess of 150 mL/min or 50% of the
patient’s total blood volume in less than 3 h [2]. Cardiac
arrest as a result of major haemorrhage contributes to a
significant proportion of pre-hospital trauma deaths and
has been shown to have a poor outcome [1]. Uncon-
trolled haemorrhage may result in the development of
the lethal triad of hypothermia, coagulopathy and acid-
osis. Each of these physiological disturbances contributes
to the development of acute traumatic coagulopathy.
Hypoperfusion leads to cellular hypoxia, leading to an-
aerobic metabolism and a metabolic acidosis. Anaerobic
metabolism will also limit endogenous heat production
exacerbating any hypothermia, which will worsen coagu-
lopathy [3]. This worsening cycle can rapidly result in
death unless haemorrhage is stopped, resuscitation com-
menced and the coagulopathic state reversed [4].
The management of hypotensive trauma patients has
changed significantly in recent years, particularly with
new research and innovation from the military conflict
zones. New strategies include minimal crystalloid resus-
citation and earlier blood product transfusion with rapid
transfer for damage control resuscitation [5]. Historic-
ally, crystalloids have commonly been administered to
trauma patients with suspected bleeding in the pre-
hospital phase. However, the administration of crystal-
loid fluids alone can result
in dilutional anaemia,
dilutional coagulopathy and reduced blood oxygen carry-
ing capacity [6]. The use of Packed Red Blood Cells
(PRBC) provides more effective volume expansion and
increased oxygen carrying capacity [7] and is therefore
routinely used during hospital resuscitation of the major
trauma patient, with major trauma centres storing PRBC
for immediate administration. For patients in traumatic
cardiac arrest, administration of PRBC is more likely to
achieve a return of spontaneous circulation than a
crystalloid or colloid infusion [8].
Early transfusion of PRBC in patients with major
haemorrhage following trauma has been shown to im-
prove outcome [7]. Depending on geography, major
trauma victims must often be transported significant dis-
tances to hospital. If PRBC are to be administered early,
it is likely they will need to be given in the pre-hospital
phase in these patients. Helicopter Emergency Medical
Service (HEMS) teams have begun to transfuse PRBC
with initial research showing favourable outcomes [9–
13]. Brown et al. [13] matched patients receiving early
PRBC transfusion to controls and showed an increased
24-h survival, lower odds ratio of shock and decreased
24-h PRBC requirement. In patients presenting in car-
diac arrest following trauma, without the option of pre-
hospital PRBC transfusion, Lockey et al. [1] reported
that 7.5% survived to hospital discharge and Willis et al.
reported a 5% survival rate to discharge [14]. More re-
cently Weaver et al. [9] reported a return a spontaneous
circulation rate of 45% in patients who suffered trau-
matic cardiac arrest on scene and received PRBC, infer-
ring that PRBC may be responsible for the improved
resuscitation in this cohort.
There are several barriers to pre-hospital blood product
transfusion. These include expense, risk of transfusion
reactions and disease transmission, short shelf-life and
concerns over wastage, problematic storage and the need
to achieve complete traceability [12].
A potential complication associated with PRBC trans-
fusion is hypocalcaemia. The influence of PRBC on
serum calcium levels is largely due to the addition of
citrate.
Recipient
citrate
levels
can
accumulate
in
massive transfusion [15]. Increased plasma citrate leads
to chelation of calcium ions. Hypocalcaemia is poten-
tially detrimental to the trauma patent as calcium regu-
lation
is
critical
for
normal
cell
function,
neural
transmission, membrane stability, bone structure, blood
coagulation and intracellular signalling [16]. It is associ-
ated with increased mortality from increased risk of
arrhythmia and a decrease in cardiac contractility [15].
Calcium is a potent inotrope and severe cardiac depres-
sion and hypotension can result from low levels [17].
The UK military currently recommends that ionised
calcium levels should be kept above 1.0 mmol/L by the
administration of 10 mL of 10% calcium chloride with
each “shock pack” (specified pre-packed blood products
for rapid issue: initially 2 units PRBC and 2 units Fresh
Frozen Plasma (FFP)) [18].
Studies to evaluate the outcome of major trauma
patients who receive pre-hospital PRBC versus crystal-
loid are on-going and the optimum triggers to initiate
pre-hospital transfusion remain unknown.
Understanding which patients have an on-going trans-
fusion requirement upon hospital arrival, will help in-
form pre-hospital transfusion practice, in particularly
guiding transfusion triggers.
The aim of this study is to describe the characteristics,
physiology, clinical interventions and outcomes of civil-
ian trauma patients receiving pre-hospital PRBC from a
UK Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS).
Methods
Setting
Kent, Surrey & Sussex Air Ambulance Trust (KSSAAT)
provides two doctor-paramedic teams, one of which
operates 24-h a day and the other 12-h a day. The teams
can deploy by helicopter or response car. The KSSAAT
HEMS service provides enhanced pre-hospital medical
care to south east England, a static population of ap-
proximately 4.3 million and a transient population of up
Lyon et al. Scandinavian Journal of Trauma, Resuscitation and Emergency Medicine  (2017) 25:12 
Page 2 of 9
 to a total of 10 million. This area consists of both urban
and rural areas and is served by Major Trauma Centres
in London, Brighton and Southampton [19]. Patient
transport to hospital can be by air or road, depending on
geography, weather, time of day and hospital helipad
availability. On average, patients are 44 km in linear dis-
tance from incident scene to receiving hospital and have
an average primary transfer time of 30 min to hospital
by air or road. The maximum road transfer time is ap-
proximately 1 h 45 min from the furthest geographical
point of the region. Statistics from The National Audit
Office suggest that in this region of the UK, there are
approximately 630 cases of major trauma annually [20].
In February 2013, KSS HEMS started carrying four
units of PRBC, based on current hospital and military
guidance and a pragmatic view of the published litera-
ture. PRBC are provided by two nearby hospital transfu-
sion laboratories and procedures are in place to ensure
full traceability of units and compliance with the Blood
Safety and Quality Regulations (2005) and Medicines
and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency [21].
The decision on-scene to administer blood is made by
the HEMS team in accordance with the relevant KSS
HEMS Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). The SOP
states that a pre-hospital blood transfusion is indicated
for patients showing signs of severe haemorrhagic shock
following trauma. The clinical assessment of this is
based on history, mechanism of injury, patient physi-
ology and response to resuscitative efforts (e.g. lack of
response to fluid given by other pre-hospital providers).
Permissive hypotension is practised and currently venti-
lated patients receive blood products to achieve a radial
pulse/blood pressure 80 mmHg only. In patients with an
isolated head injury, the target is for a systolic above
100 mmHg. A key trigger for initiating blood transfusion
in the ventilated patient is therefore loss of radial pulse.
In the awake blunt trauma patient, loss of verbal contact
is used as a trigger. In a patient with penetrating torso
trauma, packed cells are used to maintain a central
(carotid) pulse only.
In addition, the SOP states that tranexamic acid
should be given if PRBC are transfused, and that PRBC
should be transfused warm, via a filtered blood adminis-
tration set, at an appropriate rate based on patient physi-
ology. KSSAAT currently use the Belmont Buddy Lite
system
to
administer
warmed
blood
products.
All
patients should be ‘packaged’ with bubble-wrap and a
warming mat regardless of time of year, to minimise heat
loss and hypothermia.
Study subjects
All patients who received pre-hospital PRBC from KSS
HEMS between 1st February 2013 and 10th December
2014 (677 days) were included in the data set as a
convenience sample. A HEMS paramedic in the am-
bulance emergency operations control room screened
all incoming calls to identify missions appropriate for
HEMS. In addition, local ambulance crews could re-
quest HEMS’ attendance. In the 2014 calendar year,
KSS HEMS attended 1712 incidents [22]. Patient data
for all HEMS missions are routinely entered onto a
specific HEMS database.
Data collection
Patient demographic and clinical data were collected for
all patients who received blood products. Data obtained
from HEMSbase was analysed retrospectively. Data
fields analysed included sex, age, mechanism of injury,
scene distances and times, HEMS’ arrival time, physi-
ology, HEMS’ interventions, reason for transfusion, pre-
transfusion physiology, number of units of PRBC and
pre-hospital response to PRBCs.
In-hospital data and outcomes were obtained retro-
spectively from in-hospital records. The data fields ana-
lysed included physiology on arrival, initial blood gas
results, blood products transfused in the Emergency
Department, blood products transfused in the first 24 h,
surgical and interventional radiology procedures, post-
Emergency
Department
destination,
6
h
mortality,
28 day mortality, Intensive Treatment Unit length of stay
and hospital length of stay. Massive transfusion was de-
fined as either 5 units PRBCs in the Emergency Depart-
ment or 10 units PRBCs in 24 h [23] (including those
units given by HEMS). The Injury Severity Score (ISS)
score at hospital arrival was recorded.
Statistical analysis
Patient characteristics and outcomes are reported using
descriptive statistics with mean (with SDs) and median
(with IQR). Parametric data were analysed using un-
paired t-tests or ANOVAs with Bonferroni post-hoc test-
ing. Shapiro-Wilk and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were
performed on all parametric data to check for normality.
The level of significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. Data was en-
tered into Microsoft Office Excel Spreadsheet (Microsoft
Corporation, Version 7). All other data analysis per-
formed on SPSS (IBM, Version 22) for Windows.

 Results
One hundred forty-seven patients were transfused PRBC
during the study period. 114 patients were male (78%).
Median age was 42 years (range 9–92 years).
Pre-hospital data were obtained for all 147 patients,
but of the 109 (74%) patients taken to hospital, records
were only available for 85 (78%) of these. 38 (26%)
patients were declared deceased on scene.
All patients were thought to be suffering with trau-
matic haemorrhagic shock except for 5 (3%). These were
made up of 2 gastrointestinal bleeds, 2 suspected
ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms and 1 ruptured
abscess/pseudoaneurysm in an injecting drug user. One
of these patients was declared deceased on scene.
Of the 142 traumatic injuries, 128 were of blunt mech-
anism of injury (90%) and 103 (73%) were involved in
Road Traffic Collisions (RTC). Patients had a median
ISS of 33 and 90% had an ISS of greater than 15. A sum-
mary of injury mechanism is given in Table 1. A sum-
mary of included patients is shown in Fig. 1.
Pre-hospital cardiac arrest
On HEMS arrival, 103 (70%) of patients had spontan-
eous circulation. Circulation was lost in 16 (16%) pa-
tients,
but
return
of
spontaneous
circulation
was
achieved in 10 (63%) of these. 5 (31%) of these patients
were subsequently declared deceased on scene. One pa-
tient never regained spontaneous circulation but was
taken to the Emergency Department where they were
declared deceased. Of the 44 (30%) of patients without
spontaneous circulation on HEMS arrival, return of
spontaneous circulation was achieved in 6 (14%). 33
(75%)
were
declared
deceased
on
scene
and
the
remaining 5 (11%) never regained circulation but were
taken to hospital and were then declared deceased in the
Emergency Department.
Patients received a mean (SD) 2.4 (±1.1) units of
PRBC. The frequency distribution of transfused PRBC is
shown in Fig. 2. A single patient received 5 units as two
HEMS teams were present at the same incident, so two
PRBC supplies were available.
Of the 147 patients to receive pre-hospital PRBC, 56
(38%) patients had a transfusion initiated because they
had no palpable central pulse. The other reasons cited
for starting transfusion included a measured drop in
non-invasive blood pressure (39.9%), loss of peripheral
pulse (9.1%), tachycardia (2.0%) and a loss of verbal con-
tact (1.4%). For 9.6% patients it was a combination of
these reasons.
Other pre-hospital interventions in this group in-
cluded RSI (50%), thoracostomies (66%) and resuscita-
tive thoracotomy (4%).
Transport to hospital
One hundred nine (74%) patients were taken to hospital.
Median straight line distance from scene to the receiving
hospital was 43.8 km by air (IQR 27.6 – 72.4) and
55.4 km by road (IQR 36.9 – 84.7). Median time from
‘999’ call to hospital arrival was 114 min (IQR 103–140
min). Median (IQR) time for HEMS team to reach the
patient after initial ‘999’ call was 34.5 (25.0 – 48.8) mi-
nutes. Patients were therefore able to receive PRBC sig-
nificantly faster than had pre-hospital PRBC not been
available. A summary of the demographics and clinical
interventions is shown in Table 2.
Hospital care
Of the 109 patients taken to hospital, full records were
available for 75 (68%).
Pre-hospital patient physiology
Figure 3 shows the difference between physiology at the
time of HEMS’ arrival; initiation of PRBC transfusion;
and arrival at the Emergency Department. Patients
transfused with PRBC showed significant increase in sys-
tolic (p < 0.001), diastolic (p < 0.001) and mean arterial
blood pressures (p < 0.001) between the time immedi-
ately before transfusion and the time of arrival at the
Emergency Department. There was no difference in
HR (p = 0.96).
At hospital
Of the blood gases taken on arrival at hospital, 50% were
arterial in nature and 50% venous, for which the mean
values are shown in Table 3.

 In-hospital transfusion
Further blood product data was available for 70 (82.3%)
of those patients taken to hospital. Of these, 62 (89%)
went on to have further blood products and 33 (47%)
went on to have a massive transfusion. 7 patients (4% of
those transfused pre-hospital) did not receive any blood
products in hospital.
In-hospital intervention
For the patients whose hospital notes were available
(n = 75), 27 (36%) had surgery and 6 (8%) patients
had an interventional radiology procedure directly
after moving from the Emergency Department.
Operations were most commonly laparotomies (most
commonly for splenectomies); vascular operations for
repair to damaged vessels and lone bone fracture fixa-
tions. Other procedures included thoracotomy, pelvic
fixation, craniotomy and fasciotomy. Some patients had
more than one type of surgery. Radiological interven-
tions included embolisation.
The immediate post-Emergency Department destin-
ation was Intensive Care for 51%, operating theatre for
29% and the trauma ward for 6%.
Patient outcome
Eleven patients (15%) were declared deceased in the
Emergency Department. For those admitted alive (n =
64), median Intensive Care length of stay was 6 days (IQR
2–17) and hospital stay was 18 days (IQR 3–32). 21 patients
were transferred to other hospitals. This was for patients
returning to the local hospitals in 57% (including 1 inter-
national transfer) and other specialist input in the others.
For those who survived to hospital, survival at 6 h post-
arrival was 84% and at 28 days was 70%.
The patients in this study had a mean ionised calcium
of 1.1 mmol/L on arrival in the Emergency Department.
Blood gas calcium was significantly lower with increas-
ing volume of PRBCs transfused (p = 0.03).
100% traceability of pre-hospital PRBC was achieved.
There were no protocol violations. Eight units of PRBC
were wasted soon after introduction of the transfusion
protocol due to user error. No immediate transfusion
complications or high-risk incidents occurred.
Discussion
The majority of patients attended by the HEMS team in
this cohort were severely injured with a mean (SD) ISS
of 32.9 (±13.41) and 90% of patients had an ISS of >15.
Administering PRBC in the pre-hospital setting was able
to significantly reduce the time to first transfusion.
Without a system of administering pre-hospital blood
products, the majority of these severely injured patients
would have a delay of almost 2-h to receive blood prod-
ucts in hospital. A delay of more than an hour to
administer PRBC for a seriously injured patient with car-
diovascular compromise is likely to adversely affect co-
agulopathy and outcome. The patients in this cohort
showed significant signs of haemorrhagic shock with
high levels of serum acidosis, deranged base excess and
raised lactate. Given the frequency of transfusion was,
on average, every 4.6 days, and the acuity of the patients
was so high, it is likely that PRBC transfusion in the pre-
hospital phase does have a role in the management of
acutely haemorrhagic patients. Moving forward, recent
studies suggest that a 1:1 ratio of PRBC to plasma is
likely to be more beneficial when resuscitating pa-
tients with haemorrhagic shock. At the time of this
evaluation, lyophilised plasma was not available in the
UK. KSSAAT are currently evaluating use of lyophi-
lised plasma in the field.
In this study, the majority of patients had a blunt in-
jury with the most common mechanism being involve-
ment in a road traffic collision. This is similar to the
injury distribution reported by Sherren et al. [10] for
Sydney HEMS.
Patients with spontaneous circulation on HEMS’ ar-
rival who required PRBC showed less physiological
shock on arrival at hospital, as evidenced by blood pres-
sure on admission, when compared to pre-hospital ob-
servations. This echoes the findings by Brown et al. [13]
who found that pre-hospital PRBC transfusion was asso-
ciated with lower odds of shock and suggests that pre-
hospital transfusion is of value in preventing tissue
hypoperfusion.

 We found that 89% of patients went on to receive fur-
ther blood products in the ED, yet only 44% required
damage control surgery. This may be that patients re-
ceived adequate initial resuscitation but further research
is required, particularly to guide triggers for transfusion
in the pre-hospital and ED settings.
In this study, the group of hypovolaemic traumatic
cardiac arrest or peri-arrest patients had poor outcomes
as previously described by the literature. However, a
ROSC rate of 14% in patients in TCA on HEMS’ arrival
and 63% for those who suffered a traumatic cardiac ar-
rest in HEMS’ presence is above that expected and pre-
viously documented [9, 24]. Patients in traumatic cardiac
arrest following hypovolaemia are unlikely to gain return
of spontaneous circulation with a crystalloid infusion
and this high return of spontaneous rate may be attrib-
utable to blood product use. Further research is required
into the pre-hospital management of traumatic cardiac
arrest to define which of patients are most likely to
benefit from PRBC transfusion.
Early activation of massive transfusion protocols en-
sures
the
provision
of
appropriate
blood
products
quickly. These protocols have been associated with im-
proved survival [25] through the treatment of intrinsic
acute traumatic coagulopathy and prevention the devel-
opment of dilutional coagulopathy [26]. Furthermore,
the early recognition of massive haemorrhage should de-
crease the time to damage control surgery and definitive
treatment. Dailey [27] describes one system for activat-
ing a massive transfusion protocol (a patient being de-
clared “Code Red”) based on patient physiology. ‘Code
Red’ was triggered when a patient had a systolic blood
pressure (BP) of less than 90 mmHg with a poor re-
sponse to initial fluid resuscitation in the context of sus-
pected active haemorrhage. Several scoring systems have
been developed to aid the early recognition of acute ex-
sanguination. Brockamp et al. [25] examined 6 scoring
systems and found that those with weighted and the
greatest number of parameters performed better. How-
ever, many of the parameters, such as haemoglobin, base
excess and lactate are not currently measured in the pre-
hospital phase, so for our HEMS teams, the decision to
transfuse is based on clinical findings and judgment.
Given that 89% of patients given PRBCs in the pre-
hospital phase went on to have further blood products,
44% had an immediate haemorrhage control procedure
and 48% met massive haemorrhage definition, we sug-
gest that HEMS teams can reasonably predict the need
for massive transfusion based on clinical judgment
alone, with loss of radial pulse in a ventilated patient be-
ing a useful objective indicator. The addition of near pa-
tient testing, may improve accuracy and further research
is warranted in this field.
Blood gas ionised calcium was significantly lower with
increasing units of transfused PRBCs transfused; an ex-
pected relationship due to the addition of citrate into
blood products [2], and fluid resuscitation causing hae-
modilution of the remaining ions [28, 29]. Treatment of
hypocalcaemia

 recommended for patients with an ionised calcium
below 1.0 mmol/L [15]. The patients in this study had a
mean ionised calcium of 1.1 (which is just below the
lower limit of normal). Therefore, on average, patients
were just above the treatment threshold. However, ad-
ministration of calcium is likely to improve cardiovascu-
lar function and should therefore be considered – either
in the pre-hospital phase or early in-hospital.
This study demonstrates that PRBC transfusion in the
pre-hospital phase is both feasible and safe for a UK
physician-led, civilian HEMS service underpinned by a
rigorous clinical governance system. Compliance with all
NHS documentation and legislation is possible by strict
adherence with local SOPs developed in conjunction
with local NHS blood product providers.
This study has several limitations. The study cohort is
retrospective and contains a relatively small number of
patients, with incomplete hospital data. We have limited
information on the clinical decision-making that trig-
gered the individual HEMS teams to transfuse. Detailed
hospital haematology data may also have aided quantify-
ing the effect of pre-hospital transfusion on coagulopa-
thy. A confounding factor in this study is that patients
receiving PRBC were likely to be the most severely
injured and therefore require more interventions and
pre-hospital time. These patients are likely to have the
highest degrees of coagulopathy and worse outcome.
This study was unable to link with certainty pre-hospital
transfusion to improved outcome but the sample size is
relatively small. Further, larger studies are warranted to
determine whether pre-hospital transfusion of packed
red cells can improve outcome.
Conclusion
Pre-hospital PRBC transfusion is possible with complete
traceability. Pre-hospital PRBC transfusion significantly
reduces the time to transfusion for major trauma pa-
tients with suspected major haemorrhage and improves
physiology during the pre-hospital phase. Administration
of PRBC was associated with improved return of spontan-
eous circulation rate following traumatic cardiac arrest.
The majority of patients receiving pre-hospital PRBC were
severely injured and required further transfusion in hos-
pital. Further research is warranted to determine which
patients are most likely to have outcome benefit from pre-
hospital blood products and what triggers should be used
for pre-hospital transfusion.
