Abstract 
11 
Analogues have been developed and characterised for both interplanetary dust and 
12 
meteoric smoke particles. These include amorphous materials with elemental compositions 
13 
similar to the olivine mineral solid solution series, a variety of iron oxides, undifferentiated 
14 
meteorites (chondrites) and minerals which can be considered good terrestrial proxies to 
15 
some phases present in meteorites. The products have been subjected to a suite of 
16 
analytical techniques to demonstrate their suitability as analogues for the target materials.

1. Introduction 
19 
Many processes in atmospheric environments are controlled by the availability of reactive 
20 
or catalytic surfaces which originate from outside that atmosphere (Nachbar, et al., 2016, 
21 
Petrie, 2004, Plane, 2012, Turco, et al., 1981). However, this extraterrestrial material is only 
22 
partially characterised and understood in terms of these various atmospheric processes. 
23 
Meanwhile, collecting the relatively large quantities required for surface science 
24 
experiments (often grams to kilograms) from the atmosphere presents an extremely large 
25 
engineering challenge (Hedin, et al., 2014). In order to investigate and understand such 
26 
atmospheric processes, it is therefore vital to employ suitable analogue materials which will 
27 
mimic the behaviour of the environmental material. 
28 
The majority of dust which enters planetary atmospheres in our solar system originates 
29 
from either Jupiter Family Comets (JFCs), the Asteroid Belt (AB), Halley Type Comets (HTCs) 
30 
or Oort Cloud Comets (OCCs)  (Nesvorný, et al., 2011, Nesvorný, et al., 2010). To determine 
31 
the appropriate material to mimic the atmospheric behaviour of Interplanetary Dust 
32 
Particles (IDPs), the nature of such dust before encountering an atmosphere and the 
33 
processes it will undergo during atmospheric entry must be considered.

1.1. 
Composition, morphology and size distribution of Interplanetary Dust 
35 
The primary source of information about the composition and morphology of IDPs are the 
36 
large collections of micrometeorites retrieved in the stratosphere (Rietmeijer, 2000, 
37 
Zolensky and Lindstrom, 1992), the ice caps (Maurette, et al., 1987, Taylor, et al., 1998), 
38 
deserts (Kohout, et al., 2014) and deep sea sediments (Blanchard, et al., 1980). While these 
39 
collections include particles exhibiting different degrees of thermal alteration (ranging from 
40 
unmelted particles to cosmic spherules) and weathering, it has been possible to establish 
41 
their general properties before aerobraking (Jessberger, et al., 2001, Kohout, et al., 2014, 
42 
Taylor, et al., 2012). IDPs size and composition have also been investigated by particle 
43 
detectors on board orbital spacecraft such as the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) 
44 
(Love and Brownlee, 1993) and the MIR Space Station  (Hörz, et al., 2000), where the major 
45 
difficulty has been characterising the effect of the high speed impacts (v >11 km s-1) on the 
46 
exposed materials (e.g. aluminium, aerogel). Several past and ongoing space missions such 
47 
as Stardust (Hörz, et al., 2006), Deep Impact (Lisse, et al., 2006) and Rosetta (Schulz, et al., 
48 
2015) have gathered information close to cometary sources of dust. Stardust is the only 
49 
mission to date which captured dust particles ejected from a comet (81P Wild 2) and, after 
50 
deceleration and disruption in the aerogel (SiO2) collector (Trigo-Rodríguez and Llorca, 
51 
2007), returned them to Earth. Study of the aerogel keystones has allowed a thorough 
52 
laboratory chemical and mineralogical characterisation of the particles (Frank, et al., 2014, 
53 
Stephan, et al., 2008). Rosetta currently analyses in situ the composition, morphology and 
54 
optical properties of particles released by comet 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko 
55 
(Hilchenbach, et al., 2016). A caveat to these close-to-source studies is that a particular 
56 
comet is only a sample among a population of millions. Comparison of Antarctic 
57 
micrometeorites and Stardust samples shows clear similarities, but also differences 
58 
(D������� �� ���� ����). Astronomical observations and modelling have provided key 
59 
information about the spatial distribution, the sources and the size distribution of the 
60 
interplanetary dust forming the so-called Zodiacal Cloud (Ade, et al., 2014, Fixsen and Dwek, 
61 
2002, Nesvorný, et al., 2011). 
62 
The meteoroid ��������� ����� ���������� ���� �� ��� �������� ����� �� ��� E������ 
63 
atmosphere are 10-50 µm in radius (0.01 to 1 µg assuming 3 g cm-3 density) (Carrillo-
64 
Sánchez, et al., 2015, Nesvorný, et al., 2011).  The analysis of the Antarctic collections has 
65 
shown that IDPs are consistent with the Carbonaceous Ivuna (CI) chondritic composition, 
66 
while mineralogically IDPs are closer to the Carbonaceous Mighei (CM) chondritic 
67 
composition (Jessberger, et al., 2001, Taylor, et al., 2012).  Analysis of the more than 5000 
68 
micrometeorite (MM) particles of the 2000 South Pole Water Well collection, described by 
69 
Taylor, et al. (2012), indicates that 75% of IDPs are fine grained aggregates of CI-CM 
70 
elemental composition, 10% coarse grain anhydrous minerals and less than 10% ordinary 
71 
chondrites (OC). Less than 1% of the MMs have achondritic compositions, CAI components, 
72 
or recognizable chondrules.  Besides the low abundance of OC IDPs, they also show 
73 
important compositional and morphologically differences with respect to carbonaceous 
74 
 Article reference: ATP4657 
3 
 
chondritic (CC) meteorites. IDPs are extremely fine-grained aggregates, such that despite of 
75 
the mineralogical heterogeneity of the sub-micron sized grains, the bulk chemistry matches 
76 
CI and CM composition as a whole. By contrast, the matrix of carbonaceous meteorites is 
77 
composed of micron-sized coarse grained aggregates, single mineral grains, chondrules, 
78 
etc., and therefore a section of a meteorite of the same size of an IDP frequently does not 
79 
match the bulk elemental composition (Jessberger, et al., 2001).  The porosity of IDPs is in 
80 
line with that of CI and CM meteorites, with bulk densities around 2 g cm-3 (Jessberger, et 
81 
al., 2001). OC meteorites  have bulk densities higher than 3 g cm-3 because they have 
82 
experienced mild thermal metamorphism that reduces the pores (Consolmagno, et al., 
83 
2008). 
84 
1.2. 
Ablation on Atmospheric Entry 
85 
Upon encountering an atmosphere IDPs heat frictionally, often to the point of melting and 
86 
evaporating, forming a meteor. Ablation occurs both through sputtering by atmospheric 
87 
and, if the particle melts, rapid evaporation of the constituent elements. This process is 
88 
known as meteoric ablation. The majority of the incoming particles are too small to 
89 
generate visually detectable meteoroids (particles need to be larger than 1 mm radius), but 
90 
ionization of the ablated atoms by hyperthermal collisions with atmospheric molecules 
91 
forms electrons which enable detection by radar, either through specular reflection from 
92 
the resulting electron trail or by incoherent scatter from the ball of electrons around the 
93 
meteoroid � termed the head echo (e.g. (Janches, et al., 2009)). The ablation rate of a 
94 
particular meteoroid is a function of its mass, entry velocity and incident angle (Vondrak, et 
95 
al., 2008). Furthermore, the different melting points and volatilities of the various 
96 
components of meteoroids result in a process known as differential ablation, whereby the 
97 
most volatile components ablate first (Janches, et al., 2009, Trigo-Rodríguez and Llorca, 
98 
2007, Vondrak, et al., 2008). An unablated particle will then sediment through the 
99 
atmosphere under gravit� ���� �� ����� ������ ��� �� ��� E����� �� ����������� �� ��� 
100 
general atmospheric circulation and eventually reach the surface, where it is termed a 
101 
micrometeorite (MM). Partially ablated material has been identified on the E������ ������� 
102 
in the form of scoriaceous MMs and cosmic spherules, (which form when a particle melts 
103 
but does not completely ablate) (Blanchard, et al., 1980, Kohout, et al., 2014, Taylor, et al., 
104 
1998). The vaporized elements give rise to the layers of metallic atoms and ions in the 
105 
mesosphere and lower themosphere (Plane, et al., 2015). 
106 
1.3. 
Meteoric Smoke Formation and properties 
107 
The atmospheric chemistry of meteor-ablated metals depends on the atmosphere in 
108 
question (Plane, et al., 2015, Whalley and Plane, 2010). Gas-phase reactions produce stable 
109 
reservoirs which can then polymerise into nanoparticles known as meteoric smoke particles 
110 
(MSPs) (Hunten, et al., 1980, Plane, 2003). In general the most stable reservoir for a metal, 
111 
and therefore the composition of MSP, will depend on the reactivity of that metal and its 
112 
derivatives with O3 and O2 to give oxides, H2O to give hydroxides, Si(OH)4 and SiO2 to give 
113 
 Article reference: ATP4657 
4 
 
silicates and CO2 to give carbonate and bicarbonates, as well as the stability of these 
114 
compounds with respect to O and H atom reactions which reduce them back to metal atoms 
115 
(Plane, et al., 2015).  Based on laboratory experiments MSPs should then grow by rapid 
116 
agglomeration as they are transported through an atmosphere (Saunders and Plane, 2006). 
117 
I� ��� ���� �� ��� E������ ����������� M“P� ��� �������� �� reach a radius of around 100 
118 
nm in the stratosphere (Bardeen, et al., 2008).  
119 
Here MSPs and IDPs are collectively referred to as meteoric material. Particles collected by 
120 
aircraft in the stratosphere are often termed IDPs (Bigg, 2012), whilst those collected at the 
121 
surface are labelled MMs (Taylor, et al., 2012). In order to determine the most appropriate 
122 
analogue material, the key difference is between ablated and unablated material. In this 
123 
paper, IDPs should be taken to refer to unablated material, MSPs to ablated matter, and 
124 
MMs specifically to unablated material which sediments to the surface. 
125 
MSPs have been detected in a variety of ways. I� ��� E������ ���������� MSPs occur in a 
126 
weak plasma and so a small fraction are charged by electron attachment, which enables 
127 
them to be detected using rocket-borne Faraday cup detectors (Plane, et al., 2014, Rapp, et 
128 
al., 2012, Robertson, et al., 2014). These detectors can be coupled to photo-ionisation flash 
129 
lamps so that neutral particles can be detected simultaneously (Rapp, et al., 2012). 
130 
However, attempts to capture and return MSPs for detailed analysis have had very limited 
131 
success so far (Hedin, et al., 2014). Particles consisting of compact and chain aggregates 
132 
have been retrieved from the upper stratosphere and the mesosphere (Bigg, 2012, Farlow, 
133 
et al., 1970, Witt, et al., 1964). The chain aggregates are  reminiscent of fractal-like 
134 
laboratory-generated analogues (Saunders and Plane, 2006), but direct identification and 
135 
characterisation of MSPs particles has been largely inconclusive.  MSPs have also been 
136 
observed by measuring their optical extinction using the SOFIE spectrometer on the AIM 
137 
satellite (Russell, et al., 2009)), but the composition of the particles are not well constrained 
138 
(Hervig, et al., 2009). Observations of polar mesospheric clouds by SOFIE indicate the 
139 
presence of MSPs in the cloud ice particles that could be consistent with wüstite (FeO), or 
140 
magnesiowüstite (MgxFe1-xO, x= 0.1 � 0.6). Such investigation is limited by the knowledge of 
141 
refractive indexes, with comparison only possible to bulk, crystalline materials. The likely 
142 
amorphous nature of MSPs (Saunders and Plane, 2011) and further their fractal-like 
143 
morphology significantly complicates understanding of their extinction properties 
144 
(Sorensen, 2001). 
145 
1.4. 
Impacts of Meteoric Materials 
146 
The potential impacts of meteoric materials � both unablated material and MSPs - can be 
147 
grouped into three categories. First is the removal of acids such as H2SO4 and HNO3 
148 
(Frankland, et al., 2015, Saunders, et al., 2012), which undergo acid-base reactions with the 
149 
metallic species in the particles. Second is the particles providing surfaces for 
150 
heterogeneous chemistry, including the conversion of HO2 into H2O2 �� ��� E������ 
151 
stratosphere (James, et al., 2016 - Unpublished results), the cyclo-trimerization of C2H2 into 
152 
 Article reference: ATP4657 
5 
 
C6H6 �� T������ ����������� (Frankland, et al., 2016 - in press), and the oxidation of CO in 
153 
V������ ����� ���������� (Frankland, et al., 2016 - Unpublised results). Third is the 
154 
particles acting as heterogeneous nuclei, either via direct deposition of a supersaturated 
155 
vapour such as H2O or CO2 onto the meteoric particles (Nachbar, et al., 2016, Plane, 2011), 
156 
or via immersion of the particles in a liquid droplet, such as a H2SO4 ������� �� ��� E������ 
157 
stratosphere (Hoyle, et al., 2013). 
158 
Although the radiative forcing of MSPs is almost certainly negligible under present day 
159 
conditions, M“P� ��� ���� ������ � ������ ��������� ���� ������ ��� E������ ����� ������� 
160 
(Saunders, et al., 2007). In any case, MSP extinction needs to be taken into account when 
161 
interpreting optical extinction measurements in the upper stratosphere (Neely, et al., 2011).  
162 
Investigating this wide range of processes involving extraterrestrial material requires access 
163 
to appropriate analogues in the laboratory. In this paper the synthesis and characterisation 
164 
of a number of analogues for IDPs and MSPs is reported and compared to those in the 
165 
literature. The main aim of this study is therefore to lay the groundwork for future studies 
166 
which can quantify the various impacts of meteoric material in planetary atmospheres. The 
167 
paper is intended for atmospheric scientists, to introduce concepts which largely come from 
168 
the field of meteoritics, and to aid the choice of materials in future studies of atmospheric 
169 
processes. 
170 
2. Preparation of Analogues 
171 
Analogues have been prepared both by processing mineral and meteorite samples, and by 
172 
chemical synthesis from appropriate precursors. The genesis of the various samples is 
173 
described in Table 1 along with their proposed application, specific surface area and mass 
174 
density as appropriate. Note that throughout this text any crystalline materials will be 
175 
referred to by their names, whilst chemical compositions will be used for materials without 
176 
significant crystal structure. 
177 
2.1. 
Meteoritic Material 
178 
Samples of the Allende (CV3) (Clarke, et al., 1971), Murchison (CM2) (Fuchs, et al., 1973), 
179 
North West Africa 5515 (NWA, CK4) (Weisberg, et al., 2009) and Chergach (H5) (Weisberg, 
180 
et al., 2008) meteorites were ground by hand using a pestle and mortar and then sieved 
181 
(Endecottes test sieves, pore sizes of 38, 106, 150, 250 and 355 µm) to obtain size fractions 
182 
relevant for use as IDP analogues (tens to hundreds of µm radius (Bardeen, et al., 2008, 
183 
Bigg, 2012, Carrillo-Sánchez, et al., 2015)). These meteorites represent several carbonaceous 
184 
groups and one ordinary chondrite. Allende and Murchison have notably been used in a 
185 
number of previous studies investigating IDP behaviour whilst NWA and Chergach have 
186 
been included to represent outlier groups in the likely IDP flux (see Section 3.6.) (Burchell, et 
187 
al., 2006, Court and Sephton, 2011, Toppani, et al., 2001). 
188

2.2 
Terrestrial Minerals 
189 
Terrestrial minerals were also used here as analogues for fine and coarse-grained anhydrous 
190 
IDP material. These were obtained by grinding peridot olivine, labradorite, anorthite and 
191 
albite followed by size separation. These minerals were chosen as example members of 
192 
solution series.  Other members of such series or other minerals could also be used, either 
193 
alone or in mixtures, to obtain a wider range of compositions. Similar terrestrial minerals 
194 
have been used in the past to investigate IDP processing. These include simulated changes 
195 
in pyrrhotites during aerobraking e.g. (Greshake, et al., 1998) and olivine and pyroxene as a 
196 
�thermometer� for the temperatures reached by meteors (Sandford and Bradley, 1989). 
197 
2.3 
Synthetic Samples 
198 
Sol-gel synthetic routes to produce both crystalline mineral samples and amorphous 
199 
materials of suitable composition were also used. Directly synthesised compounds include 
200 
amorphous materials with compositions covering the olivine solid solution series 
201 
(MgxFe2-xSiO4 where 0 � x � 2) and goethite. These can be annealed to produce secondary 
202 
products including hematite and mixtures of crystalline phases such as enstatite and 
203 
hematite. 
204 
MgxFe2-xSiO4 compounds were synthesised by stirring at room temperature for 7 days a 
205 
mixture of stoichiometric amounts (relative to 0.1 mol l-1 product) of MgCl2 (Aldrich), 
206 
Fe(SO4)2(NH4)2 (Sigma-Aldrich) and Na4SiO4 (Alfa Aesar) (Frankland, et al., 2015). Solutions 
207 
immediately turn blue when Fe is present but otherwise are colourless. All solutions are 
208 
viscous but do not pass the inversion test. After purification, annealing of this amorphous 
209 
product at 1273 K for 24 hours was also used to generate a mixture crystalline enstatite and 
210 
hematite. 
211 
Here we report a novel method to produce pure goethite and, by processing this, hematite. 
212 
Goethite was obtained by stirring a solution of 0.1 mol l-1 each of Fe(SO4)2(NH4)2 and NaOH 
213 
for 3 days with a flow of compressed air bubbling through the reacting solution. The purified 
214 
goethite product of this reaction was dehydrated by annealing at 573 K for 24 hours to 
215 
produce hematite. All products of room temperature reactions were collected and dried in 
216 
petri dishes. Residual byproducts were removed using repeated dialysis (at least 15 hours 
217 
total) in a Soxhlet apparatus with the particles held in water permeable tubing (Snakeskin 
218 
7000 MWCO). 
219 
Purified products, along with samples of meteoritic and terrestrial materials were then 
220 
subjected to a suite of characterisation techniques in order to assess their appropriateness 
221 
as analogues for IDPs and MSPs. Mass yields after purification are >90 %, although the 
222 
possibility that H2O is adsorbed to the large surface area of the synthetic particles adds an 
223 
upward bias to such measurements. In any case, approximately 20 g of MgxFe2-xSiO4 and 
224 
3-5 g goethite can be produced in a typical 2 l batch synthesis, providing sufficient material 
225 
for characterisation and further studies.

3. Characterisation of Analogues 
227 
A thorough characterisation of each of the products described above is required to inform 
228 
their use as analogues for IDPs and/or MSPs. The properties which are required for a given 
229 
analogue depend on the application to which it is put. This is compounded by the differing 
230 
size scales of IDPs (up to several tens to hundred µm radius) and MSPs (single molecules 
231 
which polymerise and agglomerate to several hundred nm radius), which restricts 
232 
somewhat the techniques available for the characterisation of each analogue. 
233 
Where ablation is examined, it is important to understand the elemental composition and 
234 
crystal structure, particularly as this has implications for melting and evaporation. In studies 
235 
of catalysis, however, the surface properties of a sample are of paramount importance. Such 
236 
properties have been investigated for samples of the products discussed in Section 2. 
237 
3.1. 
Elemental composition 
238 
The elemental composition of a material has clear relevance to studies of virtually all 
239 
properties of meteoric material, and is arguably the most widely applicable characterisation 
240 
of both environmental and analogue samples. Taylor, et al. (2012) examined around 5000 
241 
MMs from the South Polar Water Well and showed that IDPs have likely compositions 
242 
similar to CI or CM meteorites. Whilst there is considerable uncertainty in the mineral 
243 
composition of MSPs e.g. (Hervig, et al., 2012), the elemental ratios of the metals (primarily 
244 
Fe, Mg) and SiO2 available for their formation are relatively well known (Plane, et al., 2015). 
245 
Elemental compositions were measured by Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy in 
246 
combination with Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM-EDX, Joel JSM 6610LV coupled to an 
247 
Oxford Instruments INCA X max80 EDS). The carbon signal is omitted due to interference 
248 
from carbon tape used as an SEM substrate, while the oxygen signal is affected by surface 
249 
adsorbed water. This technique is limited by statistical uncertainty, since values are 
250 
measured for individual particles or agglomerates rather than large, representative samples, 
251 
and by reduced sensitivity to lighter elements. Average values with a 95% standard error 
252 
(typically from 4-8 measurements) are therefor listed. Inductively Coupled Plasma � Atomic 
253 
Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES, ICAP 6500 ThermoElectron) has been used for two 
254 
meteoritic samples. Solutions were prepared from approximately 0.025 g of each sample 
255 
fluxed with 0.05 g of Li-metaborate and dissolved in 30 ml HNO3 1 molal and 1 drop of HF. 
256 
Four standard reference materials provided by the US Geological Survey were used for 
257 
external calibration; internal calibration of the equipment was carried out before the 
258 
measurements and rodhium was used as internal standard. Three determinations of the 
259 
elemental composition were carried out and averaged for each meteorite, showing 
260 
standard errors lower than 5% for most elements. 
261 
3.1.1. Meteoric Material 
262 
Several size fractions (particles of <19 µm and >177.5 µm radii) of the Chergach and NWA 
263 
(particles of 19-53 µm and 125-177.5 µm radii) meteorites were analysed by SEM-EDX. The 
264 
 Article reference: ATP4657 
8 
 
composition of the Allende and Murchison meteorite samples were measured by ICP-AES. 
265 
Elemental compositions of all four meteorites are compared to CI, CM composition and to 
266 
their respective groups (Hutchison, 2004) in Figure 1. Note that the differences between 
267 
standard compositions are generally smaller than the standard errors in the compositions. 
268 
This is due to the coarse grained nature of meteorites in general. After grinding, grains of 
269 
individual minerals distort the measured composition away from the mean of a larger 
270 
sample. 
271 
The Chergach meteorite, shown in Figure 1 a), Si, Cr, Mn, Mg, Ca, K and P all agree within 
272 
error with the standard compositions. Na and Al are enhanced (although Al is in agreement 
273 
with the CM compositions) suggesting that the sample contained albite. Fe, Ni and S are 
274 
depleted, suggesting that minor phases such as Fe-Ni metallic alloys and metal sulfides or 
275 
sulfates are underrepresented in the sample. The Chergach meteorite has a rather Mg rich 
276 
olivine content, with much of the Fe being contained in a metallic or alloy form, consistent 
277 
with an enhancement of major phases over minor in these measurements (Weisberg, et al., 
278 
2008). Differences in the two size fractions are generally smaller than the uncertainty. 
279 
However major constituent elements are enhanced in the smaller size fractions, whilst 
280 
minor elements are depleted. This suggest that some softer phases are enhanced in the 
281 
smaller size fractions, whilst phases which grind less easily are enhanced in larger size 
282 
fractions. There is also a potential effect of particle size; since a flat surface is required for 
283 
quantitative measurements, single particles are used and measurements of the smaller size 
284 
fractions therefore survey less material. This could lead to an underrepresentation of rare 
285 
component phases and elements. In compositional terms, therefore, Chergach (and 
286 
potentially other OCs) are a reasonable approximation for IDPs. This is significant since OCs 
287 
are generally more available than CCs. 
288 
The Murchison and Allende meteorites, shown in Figure 1b), have been included here as 
289 
examples of carbonaceous chondrites which are commonly used as analogues for IDPs 
290 
(Burchell, et al., 2006, Court and Sephton, 2011, Toppani, et al., 2001). Allende has suffered 
291 
some degree of thermal metamorphism so has compositions within the CI-CM range for all 
292 
elements except Mg, Na and K. The Allende meteorite is known to have an Fe rich olivine 
293 
matrix, accounting for the Mg depletion. The low abundance of relatively volatile elements 
294 
such as Na and K is typical of CV meteorites but is known to be extreme in the case of 
295 
Allende (Clarke, et al., 1971). However, these elemental constituents and their relatively 
296 
volatile phases (melting points <1500 K) are present in all samples observed. The Murchison 
297 
sample agrees well with the CI or CM elemental composition, a fact which, combined with 
298 
its relatively large available mass (>100 kg) has led to its wide use as an IDP analogue. 
299 
The 125-177.5 µm radius size fraction of the NWA meteorite sample, shown in Figure 1 c), is 
300 
significantly enriched in Ca and depleted in Na. In addition minor elements including Ti, Mn, 
301 
K, P, Co and S are below the limit of detection. In the 19-53 µm radius size fraction, SEM-
302 
EDX analysis shows a highly heterogeneous composition, with each particle appearing to 
303 
represent a single phase (elemental ratios consistent with Andesine, Olivine and Augite 
304 
 Article reference: ATP4657 
9 
 
were observed). This suggests a large content of refractory (melting point >2000 K) and 
305 
coarse grained components, inconsistent with the bulk of the IDP flux. This highlights the 
306 
fact that not all CC meteorites are inherently suitable as IDP analogues. Such materials can 
307 
be useful, however for examining extreme events, e.g. differential ablation of particles with 
308 
large entry velocities. 
309 
Ground meteorites are therefore variably suitable analogues for IDPs in terms of elemental 
310 
composition, however they do contain many relevant phases (see section 3.2.1) and since 
311 
the ablation process is dominantly controlled by the melting point of the phase (Vondrak, et 
312 
al., 2008), should act as satisfactory analogues in particular cases.  
313 
3.1.2. Terrestrial Material 
314 
Peridot olivine, labradorite, anorthite and albite samples have also been subjected to 
315 
SEM-EDX analysis. The olivine was found to be Fo90 forsterite (ratios of Mg:Fe = 10 ± 4 and 
316 
(Fe+Mg):Si = 1.9 ± 0.6) with some content of Ni, Ca and Al, consistent with the volcanic 
317 
basalt casing around the peridot in which the olivine formed. The labradorite was measured 
318 
as having An55 composition (ratios of Na:Ca = 0.8 ± 0.2 and (Na+Ca):(Si+Al) = 0.244 ± 0.014). 
319 
The anorthite sample was found to have An97 composition (ratios of Na:Ca = 0.04 ± 0.02 and 
320 
(Na+Ca):(Si+Al) = 0.244 ± 0.014). The albite sample was found to have a composition 
321 
consistent with such a sodium feldspar (ratios of Al:Si = 0.344 ± 0.013 and 
322 
Na:Si = 0.33 ± 0.04). The reproducibility (standard errors typically <20 %) of these 
323 
measurements and their agreement with expected ratios for each mineral support the use 
324 
of the SEM-EDX characterisation technique so long as numerous spectra are measured for 
325 
each sample. 
326 
3.1.3. Synthetic samples 
327 
SEM-EDX has been used extensively here to assess the composition of the synthetic 
328 
products, particularly with regards to the removal of NaCl and Na2SO4 salt byproducts. In 
329 
general it was found that around 10 hours of processing in the Soxhlet apparatus was 
330 
sufficient to remove these byproducts. This validates the synthesis described above. 
331 
Subsequent to the purification process, compositions were confirmed for goethite (Fe:O = 
332 
0.6 ± 0.4), hematite (Fe:O = 0.7 ± 0.3), Mg2SiO4 (Mg:Si = 2.0 ± 0.5) and Fe2SiO4 (Fe:Si = 2.4 ± 
333 
0.8). When a ratio of precursors designed to produce MgFeSiO4 was used, a ratio of Mg:Fe = 
334 
0.43 ± 0.12 and (Fe+Mg):Si = 1.8 ± 0.3 was measured. The overabundance of Fe can partially 
335 
be explained by the presence of a ferrihydrite or goethite impurity (see section 3.2.2.); 
336 
however, since the ratio of Fe+Mg to Si is not less than 2 it is possible that Mg 
337 
accommodation into the synthetic MgxFe2-xSiO4 is less effective than that of Fe. This 
338 
measured composition did not significantly vary on annealing to enstatite / hematite. 
339 
Note that oxygen ratios are reported for the crystalline iron oxides, but not for amorphous 
340 
silicates. This is due to contamination by surface adsorbed H2O in the case of the amorphous 
341 
silicates, despite storing the samples in a vacuum dessicator for several weeks prior to 
342 
 Article reference: ATP4657 
10 
 
composition measurements. This is thought to be due to the relatively large surface area of 
343 
the silicate materials with respect to the iron oxides (hundreds as opposed to several m2 g-1 
344 
respectively, see Table 1 and Section 3.3). For applications where surface reactivity is 
345 
important, this surface water could be removed by heating in a vacuum, though potential 
346 
phase changes in the dust by such annealing should be considered where this is carried out 
347 
(see section 3.2). In generally, target compositions could be successfully synthesised and 
348 
assayed using the techniques described here. Of the elements described here, Fe is the 
349 
���� �������� �� E������ ����������� M� ��� “� ���� � �������� ����� ��������� ���� N�� K 
350 
etc. present in smaller amounts (Plane, et al., 2015). Elementally then, these materials 
351 
therefore represent suitable compositional analogues for MSPs. 
352 
3.2. 
Textural analysis and compositional maps 
353 
The homogeneity of analogues is one of the key differences between ground bulk samples 
354 
and IDPs. This can be evident in the elemental or mineralogical composition of the analogue 
355 
material. Particle topography and homogeneity, both within each particle and across whole 
356 
samples, was assessed using SEM-EDX mapping (FEG-SEM � FEI Nova 450) with EDX 
357 
(AMTEK) at 18 kV) for the Chergach and Allende meteorites. Particles forming the Allende 
358 
CV3 carbonaceous chondrite are heterogeneous even to the naked eye, with some white 
359 
and some rounded glassy particles evident. These correspond respectively with Ca- and 
360 
Al-rich inclusions and chondrules. Chergach particles, on the other hand, appear more 
361 
homogeneous within each size fraction because of the recrystallization shown in this 
362 
petrologic type (H5) of ordinary chondrites. These trends hold through to the microscopic 
363 
scale, as demonstrated by the following analysis. 
364 
Figure 2 shows a micrograph and co-located compositional maps for a particle of Chergach. 
365 
The Mg rich olivine matrix is clearly demonstrated, with smaller grains of a variety of phases 
366 
evident. These potentially include metallic Fe (top left, bottom centre) albite / feldspar 
367 
(regions with Na and Ca). 
368 
Figure 3 shows a wide angle micrograph of a large section of the Allende meteorite before 
369 
grinding. Large features (100s of µm) are visible including a barred olivine chondrule (A), a 
370 
porphyritic olivine chondrule (B), the fine grained carbonaceous matrix (C) and a metal 
371 
sulfide inclusion (D). The scale of this image makes it clear that, while the mean of a large 
372 
sample of particles may be a CI or CM (or in this case CV) composition as are IDPs, a ground 
373 
sample of the meteorite will contain an overabundance of coarse and simple mineral grains, 
374 
which would be representative of only a small fraction of IDPs. 
375 
Figure 4 shows an aggregate particle of Allende, where a region of scoreacious material is in 
376 
contact with a fine grained region (boundary marked by a dashed white line). EDX mapping, 
377 
performed on the region shown by the white box on the micrograph, shows that the 
378 
scoreacious region is depleted in volatile elements such as S, likely indicating loss of volatile 
379 
phases such as troilite or more likely metal sulfate (Burgess, et al., 1991). The fine grained 
380 
region also shows a more heterogeneous content, with some Ca containing domains 
381 
 Article reference: ATP4657 
11 
 
evident. This suggests that the right-hand region has undergone significantly more heating, 
382 
sufficient for volatile phases to evapourate and leave only the anhydrous metal silicate 
383 
content. The left-hand region, however, has undergone less thermal alteration and 
384 
resembles more closely a fine grained IDP. 
385 
Figure 5 shows two grains of Allende, one single mineral grain (left) and one fine aggregate 
386 
(right). The single mineral particle appears to be a sodalite or nepheline (sodium silicate, 
387 
albite is not present in significant quantities in the Allende meteorite (Clarke, et al., 1971)). 
388 
The fine grained aggregate demonstrates the Fe rich olivine matrix of the Allende meteorite, 
389 
with a heterogeneous content of Na, Al, Ca and some detectable Ni.  
390 
These examples have been selected to provide a flavour of the variability in the chondrites 
391 
examined here. Such heterogeneous compositions are common in IDPs, however the fine 
392 
grained nature of the majority of IDPs means that large grains such as those observed here 
393 
are rare. Other authors have reported on the particle-to-particle variability inherent in 
394 
ground meteorites (Jessberger, et al., 2001); however, the direct comparison presented 
395 
here allows some clear conclusions to be drawn. The variability displayed here for the 
396 
Allende meteorite demonstrates the need to characterise samples in detail, since this 
397 
heterogeneity could have significant consequences when analysing the surface or bulk 
398 
properties. For example, the rates of catalytic processes or early or late release of an 
399 
ablating material could be dominated by a statistically uncommon particle or active site.  
400 
One further observation is that the elemental heterogeneity in Chergach is not significantly 
401 
different to that in Allende. While the texture of the grains is significantly different, grains of 
402 
similar elements are present with a similar heterogeneity. This suggests that Chergach and 
403 
other OC meteorites may be similar to the comparatively rare CC meteorites as IDP 
404 
analogues. 
405 
3.3. 
Crystal Structure 
406 
The crystal structure of the analogue used can be important for many applications. It is 
407 
crucial, for example, when studying the differential ablation of IDPs since each element will 
408 
be released dependent upon the melting points of its constituent phases and its vapour 
409 
pressure over these phases. The crystal structure of the analogues was investigated by 
410 
powder X-Ray Diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 equipped with a germanium monochromator, 
411 
using Cu K-� radiation). Measured patterns were compared to literature structures via a 
412 
Rietveld refinement. This involves reproducing a pattern by comparison to one or more 
413 
structures. Inputs such as the crystallographic space group, lattice parameters and atomic 
414 
positions allow the prediction of patterns which can be compared to the experimental 
415 
observations. Factors such as nanocrystallinity and sample displacement can also be 
416 
simulated to investigate peak shifts and broadening effects. Here this was carried out using 
417 
the TOPAS software (McCusker, et al., 1999). 
418 
 Article reference: ATP4657 
12 
 
3.3.1. Meteoric and Terrestrial Material 
419 
XRD analysis was only performed for the Chergach H5 OC due to the limited availability of 
420 
other samples. Observed patterns for the albite and peridot olivine samples are compared 
421 
to that of Chergach in Figure 6. Measured patterns (in black) can be reproduced by Rietveld 
422 
refinements (in red). For peridot olivine a forsterite structure produces good agreement, for 
423 
albite a structure of that mineral agrees well, and for Chergach structures of forsterite, 
424 
albite and ferrosilite combine to give a good representation of the data. Whilst ferrosilite is 
425 
not likely present in significant quantities, the enstatite end member of the same solid 
426 
solution series has a similar structure. This suggests that in structural terms Chergach 
427 
chondrite can be represented simply by a mixture of terrestrial minerals. Comparison to the 
428 
SEM-EDX mapping, particularly the similarity of the heterogeneous phases present suggests 
429 
that this can also be extended to other meteorites and IDPs. It is worth noting that the 
430 
sample likely contains many other minor phases which are below the limits of detection 
431 
here.  
432 
In terms of ablation experiments, individual minerals are useful to characterise phase 
433 
changes as a function of heating (Sandford and Bradley, 1989). Mixtures of minerals may be 
434 
valuable to compare to meteoritic aggregates or even to IDPs if available, and hence 
435 
evaluate the effect of grain aggregation and porosity on the release of the elemental 
436 
constituents. Consideration should be given, however, to the variation of melting points 
437 
across solid solution series e.g. (Bowen, 1913). In the specific case of the Chergach 
438 
meteorite (olivine composition Fo81.6, (Weisberg, et al., 2008)) the melting point of some 
439 
phases may be similar, however for a more general study such considerations should be 
440 
taken into account and terrestrial mineral analogues chosen with care. Terrestrial minerals 
441 
can also be of great value in calibrating instruments, providing simple systems with known 
442 
elemental ratios which are easy to characterise and available in greater supply than 
443 
meteorite samples.  
444 
3.3.2. Synthetic samples 
445 
XRD patterns for the synthetic samples discussed in this study are shown in Figure 7. 
446 
Reitveld refinement (see Section 3.3, above) has a variable, though generally good, ability to 
447 
reproduce the observed patterns and in some cases providing useful information regarding 
448 
the synthetic product. 
449 
MgxFe2-xSiO4 materials are mainly amorphous by XRD. In the case of Fe2SiO4 the broad 
450 
crystalline peaks observed can be fitted with a goethite phase. For MgFeSiO4 the similarly 
451 
broad peaks are compared to a 6 line ferrihydrite phase. Ferrihydrite is a hydrated iron 
452 
oxide similar to goethite. The broadness of these peaks, particularly that around 35°, is an 
453 
indication of an amorphous phase or of crystals on the nm scale. For MgFeSiO4 the pattern 
454 
has been fitted assuming crystallites of 2.5 nm radius and for Fe2SiO4 the crystallites are 
455 
assumed to have radii of 5.2 nm. This nanocrystallinity is discussed further in the context of 
456 
 Article reference: ATP4657 
13 
 
the particle morphologies in section 3.4. Implications of this crystallinity in terms of using 
457 
these materials as analogues for MSPs are discussed in section 3.6.  
458 
For an annealed sample of MgFeSiO4 strong crystalline peaks are observed, which can be 
459 
fitted with a hematite phase. Repeated SEM-EDX analysis shows that the composition does 
460 
not change, suggesting that Mg and Si are present as an amorphous or nanocrystalline 
461 
MgSiO3 phase. 
462 
The XRD pattern of synthetic goethite is well fitted by assuming a structure of that mineral. 
463 
Upon annealing a sample of this material at 573 K for 24 hours the XRD pattern could be 
464 
modelled reasonably well by a hematite structure, consistent with the dehydration of the 
465 
goethite (Gualtieri and Venturelli, 1999). The fit in this case is imperfect, notably some 
466 
peaks show significant broadening and the relative peak intensities are not well 
467 
represented. Since peak broadening due to crystalline size is angle dependent this is likely 
468 
an indication of relatively small crystallites (perhaps 50-100 nm in radius) but we were not 
469 
able to find a crystallites size which gave a good fit. Peak intensity variations are likely due 
470 
to some preferred orientation. Implications of this crystallinity in terms of using these 
471 
materials as analogues for MSPs are also discussed in section 3.5. 
472 
3.4. 
Surface Area and Morphology 
473 
Surface properties are of paramount importance for the heterogeneous reactivity of an 
474 
atmospheric solid and therefore an analogue intended to investigate such phenomena. The 
475 
upper limit to the available reactive surface area was measured for the materials discussed 
476 
here by the Brunauer, Emmet and Teller (BET, Micrometrics ASAP 2020) method. The results 
477 
are shown in Table 1. The anomalously high specific surface area for the MgxFe2-xSiO4 
478 
materials is due to their unusual surface morphology.   
479 
This was investigated by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai F20 200kV 
480 
FEGTEM fitted with a Gatan Orius SC600 CCD camera), with a representative micrograph 
481 
shown in Figure 8. The thin, folded sheet like nature of the material leads to a large surface 
482 
potentially being available for uptake and reaction of gases. 
483 
The inset to Figure 8 shows that at atomic resolution nanocrystalline domains can be seen 
484 
on the surface of the MgFeSiO4. The scale of these domains is close to the 2.5 nm radius 
485 
required to resolve the ferrihydrate peaks in the XRD analysis discussed above. This is 
486 
compelling evidence that these crystalline domains produce the peaks seen in the XRD 
487 
patterns and can therefore be considered an upper limit to their size. The implications of 
488 
this nanocrystallinity in terms of using these materials as analogues for MSPs are discussed 
489 
in section 3.5. 
490 
The surface area which is actually involved in reaction will depend on the reactivity in a 
491 
given system, however this large upper limit allows measurement of processes which are 
492 
relatively slow (Frankland, et al., 2015). The question of available surface area is also 
493 
pertinent in the environment, since fractal or dendritic particles are often represented as 
494 
 Article reference: ATP4657 
14 
 
spheres for reasons of computation efficiency (Saunders, et al., 2007). Atmospheric 
495 
processing by H2O and acidic gases may also change the available surface area over time. 
496 
Any use of such materials for surface science should include a careful study of the available 
497 
surface area. In contrast, crystalline materials such as the goethite and hematite analogues 
498 
presented here generally have BET surface areas close to that calculated by assuming 
499 
spherical particles of reasonable size distribution (see Section 3.5). In that case the available 
500 
surface area in a given experiment can often be well approximated by considering the 
501 
experimental geometry (e.g. a coated flow tube), or assuming that layered samples of 
502 
particles are close packed spheres with associated pore spaces (Keyser, et al., 1991). 
503 
3.5. 
Size Distributions and Density 
504 
The size distribution of an analogue can be important for many reasons. For example, a 
505 
layered sample of uniform sized particles might be expected to close pack with open pores, 
506 
whilst a more heterogeneous distribution might have these pores between larger particles 
507 
filled by smaller particles. Evaporation of particles may be kinetically controlled by the 
508 
surface for smaller particles, or diffusion through the molten bulk of larger particles. Density 
509 
is also important in thermal studies since it impacts on the conductivity of the material, and 
510 
in surface studies since the density of active sites is likely related to the density of a 
511 
particular surface feature (e.g. a particular ion or structural defect). 
512 
For dense, approximately spheroidal particles such as the hematite, goethite, enstatite / 
513 
hematite and ground meteorites and minerals described here measuring the particle size 
514 
distribution, which results from grinding, is important for designing experiments and 
515 
interpreting results. For particles on the µm scale, optical microscopy can be used to probe 
516 
such properties. Here we have used a backlit optical microscope equipped with an objective 
517 
with a magnification of 10 to image arrays of particles. Typically around 3 dozen images 
518 
containing 300-600 individual particles were produced using the following algorithm. First, 
519 
particles were differentiated from the image background by the pixel brightness; second, to 
520 
account for particles lying on top of each other in the images, the identified particles were 
521 
artificially eroded until they separate and then rebuilt until they touch; particles in contact 
522 
with the image edge were discarded; a minimum particle size was set to remove a 
523 
background of smaller particles from each image; the area of each particle was then 
524 
calculated (pixels were converted to µm2 by reference to a standard 1 µm image). Control of 
525 
the minimum size and pixel brightness threshold allow the analysis to function even for 
526 
moderately transparent or reflective particles. Each particle area was converted to an 
527 
equivalent circular radius, and the resulting particle size distribution was then fitted to a log-
528 
normal distribution and normalised to a probability density function for comparison. 
529 
The erosion and reconstruction process introduces several uncertainties into the analysis. 
530 
First, the volume of a particle which lies on top of another is not counted, giving a 
531 
downward bias in the estimated size, while imperfect separation of particles where the 
532 
distance of contact is similar to the particle dimensions leads to an upward bias. Treating 
533 
 Article reference: ATP4657 
15 
 
particle radius based on area is a major assumption of this method. For example, if the 
534 
particle contacts a substrate or gas medium in profile then this may be valid, provided that 
535 
the particles lay similarly in situ to their position on the microscope slide. However if volume 
536 
properties (such as optical extinction) of the material is to be investigated then this method 
537 
would likely overestimate the volume distribution, since gravitational settling on the surface 
538 
of the microscope slide will tend to favour the particles laying horizontally. This would result 
539 
in the shortest dimension being in the vertical (which is neglected here). 
540 
Example images for two of the meteorites and two of the terrestrial minerals discussed here 
541 
are shown along with the measured size distributions for the Chergach meteorite in Figure 
542 
9. Figure 9 (b) shows the result of analysing Figure 9 (a) using the image analysis software, 
543 
where overlapping particles have been separated and all those which were touching the 
544 
image edge have been discarded. The sizes of the remaining particles are used in 
545 
determining the size distributions. These observed distributions have mean sizes within the 
546 
stated pore size of the sieves used for separation. In general, materials which form 
547 
needle-like particles (e.g. albite, see Figure 7 d) give slightly larger sizes in this analysis since 
548 
they are better able to penetrate the pores in the sieves. 
549 
Size analysis techniques for smaller particles generally involve suspending particles in either 
550 
a gaseous (e.g. Scanning Mobility Particle Size (SMPS) analysis (Liu and Deshler, 2003)) or 
551 
liquid (e.g. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) (Chu, 2008)) medium. Aggregation can influence 
552 
the results of these experiments such that in some cases only the limits of particle sizes are 
553 
measurable. Measurements by both SMPS and DLS have shown that the MgxFe2-xSiO4 
554 
analogues discussed here have primary particle radii on the order of 200-500 nm. TEM 
555 
imaging shows the presence of some particles on smaller scales (down to 10s of nm). 
556 
Proper measurement and interpretation of particle sizes is extremely specific to the 
557 
application in question, however one general point to note is that while generating 
558 
analogues to IDPs on the appropriate scale is relatively easy, the relatively small size of 
559 
MSPs (molecular dimensions up to 100 nm radii (Bardeen, et al., 2008)) means that 
560 
manufacturing analogues for these particles in sufficient quantity for many experiments is 
561 
extremely challenging. Instead, the approach in the present study is to generate particle 
562 
analogues likely to have similar properties, and the measured properties (e.g. rates or 
563 
extinctions) extrapolated to atmospherically relevant particle size distributions. 
564 
Another volume dependent quantity which can be important for experimental applications 
565 
is the mass density of the analogue. Mass densities for some of the analogues discussed 
566 
here are given in Table 1. The synthetic samples have densities significantly lower than for 
567 
their equivalent bulk minerals, including those materials which are crystalline. This suggests 
568 
a significant porosity, in agreement with the morphology described above for the 
569 
MgxFe2-xSiO4 materials. Jessberger, et al. (2001) also noted a significant porosity in collected 
570 
micrometeorites and IDPs.

Discussion 
572 
The meteorite samples discussed here represent a range of types (CC and OC, differing 
573 
metamorphic groups). Whilst CC materials such as CI and CM appear to dominate the IDP 
574 
flux, design of experiments using meteorites as IDP analogues is generally restricted to 
575 
those types for which large masses of sample are readily available. The elemental 
576 
composition, heterogeneity and crystal structure data presented indicate, however, that in 
577 
many cases OC meteorites or even single minerals represent suitable analogues to IDPs 
578 
(even beyond the 10 % of IDPs which are OC material). Murchison is a good example of an 
579 
aqueously altered chondrite (groups 2) and contains significant hydrated minerals such as 
580 
philosylicates, as found in fine grained IDPs (Taylor, et al., 2012). These phases will 
581 
dehydrate and recrystallise when heated and so will most likely ablate similarly to the 
582 
feldspathic minerals present in OCs. In addition, analysis of the NWA meteorite shows that 
583 
there are large deviations within CC meteorites, and that many of these may be useful only 
584 
for examining extreme or rare cases of IDPs. For example, studies are underway at the 
585 
University of Leeds into differential ablation using a new Meteor Ablation Simulator (MASI) 
586 
instrument (Gómez Martín, et al., 2016 - Unpublished results). Kearsley, et al. (2009) 
587 
produced cometary analogues for impact studies in aerogel and Al foil by aggregating 
588 
mineral fragments using an acrylic adhesive. These analogues provide excellent insights into 
589 
the collection of IDPs and cometary dust in aerogel. From the point of view of chemical 
590 
ablation and surface chemistry studies, which take place on a relatively long time scale 
591 
compared to impact and where the adhesive may cause undesired interferences, further 
592 
characterisation experiments are required. The adhesive coating would also be likely to 
593 
interfere with surface science experiments, where the mineral surface should be exposed to 
594 
be observed directly. 
595 
Saunders and Plane (2011) have described a method of producing MSP analogues by 
596 
photolysis of chemical precursors which then recondense in the gas phase. Amorphous 
597 
MgxFe2-xSiO4 materials and Fe oxides are produced with a primary particle radius of 5-10 
598 
nm. These small primary particles agglomerate to produce fractal-like particles, likely a good 
599 
representation of environmental MSPs. These particles have been probed for their optical 
600 
properties and ice nucleating ability (Saunders, et al., 2010, Saunders and Plane, 2006). We 
601 
note that the amorphous nature found for those particles is similar to that described here. 
602 
Where the primary particle radius is 5-10 nm, this sets the upper limit of the crystallite size 
603 
similar to MgxFe2-xSiO4 sheets with maximum thicknesses / domain radii of several nm 
604 
(Figure 8). 
605 
One significant difference is that the photochemical methods are able to produce Fe oxides 
606 
which are amorphous, whereas we only observe crystalline products. This may simply be 
607 
due to the size of the crystallites formed. Whereas in the photochemistry experiments many 
608 
particles nucleate, take up the available precursor and at some point grow faster by 
609 
agglomeration than deposition to existing particles, our solution phase synthesis allows 
610 
relatively fewer particles to grow to larger sizes at which their crystallinity is measurable. 
611 
 Article reference: ATP4657 
17 
 
Since MSP remain at small sizes, the photochemical method is likely more representative, so 
612 
that care should be taken when using the materials synthesised by sol-gel processes as 
613 
analogues for MSP. 
614 
Biermann, et al. (1996), who used micrometeorites as analogues for MSP nucleating 
615 
crystallisation in polar stratospheric clouds, found that nucleation rates were not high 
616 
enough to explain observed cloud. As the authors in that study observed, micrometeorites 
617 
are generally compact, dense particles coated with magnetite crystals. MSPs which are 
618 
present in stratospheric droplets, on the other hand, will have been processed and largely 
619 
dissolved by the acidic content of those droplets (Saunders, et al., 2012). Murphy, et al. 
620 
(2014) used single particle mass spectrometer measurements to show that silicon and 
621 
aluminium in such droplets are generally solid while most other metals are in solution. A 
622 
silica or alumina substrate would therefore seem more appropriate for investigating 
623 
nucleation in polar stratospheric clouds. 
624 
Nachbar, et al. (2016) used photolysis of chemical precursors to produce very small (several 
625 
nm radii) particles, which were held in an ion trap at supersaturated conditions and used to 
626 
measure nucleation kinetics and particle growth. These particles are alike both in size and 
627 
composition to MSPs and therefore are highly appropriate as MSP analogues. As with the 
628 
photochemical technique of Saunders and Plane (2011), the difficulty in using this material 
629 
to investigate a wider range of applications lies in producing bulk amounts (typically several 
630 
grams are required for uptake experiments). 
631 
4. Conclusions 
632 
This study has demonstrated the preparation of a variety of analogues for IDPs and MSPs. 
633 
The methods are fairly straightforward to implement and use materials which are widely 
634 
available. No single analogue best represents IDPs or MSPs in general since this rather 
635 
depends on the application being investigated. Instead some common issues are raised in 
636 
order to help researchers choose materials for a wide range of applications. 
637 
It has been shown that reasonable analogues for IDPs can be produced by grinding and size 
638 
segregating meteoritic material. The elemental composition of such analogues will vary 
639 
slightly from the target material but phases which are present in IDPs will be well 
640 
represented in ground meteorites. OCs are scarce in micrometeorite collections, but 
641 
samples of OC meteorites are much easier to source than CCs. Although ground OCs 
642 
produce denser, more compact analogues, elemental compositions and mineralogy are 
643 
reasonably close to those of average IDPs. Terrestrial materials such as peridot olivine, 
644 
labradorite, anorthite and albite, when similarly ground, are good analogues for individual 
645 
phases within IDPs, particularly for applications such as instrument calibration where 
646 
paucity of sample can be an issue. In the cases of both meteorites and terrestrial minerals it 
647 
was shown that mechanical sieving can reliably produce target particle size fractions which 
648 
are representative of IDPs. 
649 
 Article reference: ATP4657 
18 
 
Chemical syntheses were presented for compounds with elemental compositions similar to 
650 
the olivine solid solution series. These are thought to be nanocrystalline folded sheets. Such 
651 
a morphology is not likely representative of MSPs or IDPs, however it should be noted that 
652 
the domain size of such crystallites is similar to the primary particle size of MSPs and 
653 
therefor a similar nanocrystallinity may be possible. The large surface area presented by this 
654 
morphology allows measurement of relatively unreactive processes which occur at the 
655 
interface, whilst the elemental composition is similar to that expected for MSPs. These 
656 
materials can be annealed to produce enstatite and hematite, which are also suitable 
657 
analogues for potential components of MSPs. 
658 
A chemical synthesis was also presented for crystalline goethite, which could be dehydrated 
659 
to produce hematite. Goethite is a potential component of MSP whilst hematite could be 
660 
present in both IDPs and MSPs. The crystalline nature of these materials may not be 
661 
representative of MSPs; nevertheless for some applications they may still be considered 
662 
suitable analogues. 
663 
Finally, it is clearly of great importance that in laboratory experiments where analogues are 
664 
used for IDP or MSP materials, careful attention is paid to characterising the analogue and 
665 
ensuring that the limitations of its applicability are understood.

Figure 1. Elemental compositions, normalised to Si, comparing each of the meteorites used 
here to the composition of CI, CM and its own group (Hutchison, 2004). a) Two size fractions 
(<19 µm and >177.5 µm) of the Chergach (H5) meteorite. b) The Allende (CV3) and 
Merchison (CM2) meteorites. c) The North West Africa 5515 (CK4) meteorite, 125-177.5 µm 
size fraction. Error bars show the 95% confidence interval of 4-8 measurements. 
Measurement techniques vary, see text for details. 
Figure 2. SEM-EDX mapping for a particle of the Chergach meteorite. Si is omitted due to 
interference from the substrate. The bulk Fo82 olivine is clearly shown in the Mg panel. 
Grains containing Fe & Ca (lower centre), Na & K (lower right and centre right), and each of 
those elements individually. 
Figure 3. Backscatter electron image of a thin section of the Allende meteorite before 
grinding demonstrating the scale of individual features such as a barred olivine chondrule 
(A), a porphyritic olivine chondrule (B), the fine grained carbonaceous matrix (C) and a metal 
sulfide inclusion (D). 
Figure 4. SEM-EDX mapping for a particle of the Allende meteorite, showing both a fine 
aggregate and scoreacious grains. The fine aggregate particle has a higher S content and is 
more heterogeneous than the scoreacious grain. 
Figure 5. SEM-EDX mapping for two particles of the Allende meteorite, showing one single 
mineral particle and one fine aggregate grain. Si can be included here since a Cu substrate 
was used. The single mineral (left) particle shows a homogeneous composition consistent 
with nepheline or sodelite, whilst the fine grain aggregate appears to have an olivine matrix 
containing grains of diverse composition. 
Figure 6. Observed powder X-ray diffraction patterns for peridot olivine, albite and the 
Chergach meteorite. The black lines show measured data and the red lines show Rietveld 
refinements. Peridot olivine is compared to a forsterite structure, Albite to a structure of 
that material and the Chergach meteorite to a combination of both. 
Figure 7. XRD patterns for synthetic samples produced in this study. Measured data are in 
black and fits from Rietveld refinement in red. Data have been scaled and offset to show an 
appropriate scale in each case.
