Abstract
Objective—Determine the efficacy and safety of high dose vitamin D supplementation for ARI 
prevention in older long-term care residents.
Design, Setting, and Participants—Randomized controlled trial investigating high dose vs 
standard dose vitamin D conducted from 2010–2014. Participants were older residents (≥60 years) 
of Colorado long-term care facilities.
Interventions—1) The high dose group received monthly supplement of 100,000 IU vitamin D3; 
2) The standard dose group received either a monthly placebo (for participants taking 400–1,000 
IU/day as part of usual care) or a monthly supplement of 12,000 IU of vitamin D3 (for participants 
taking <400 IU/day as part of usual care).
Main Outcomes—Incidence of ARI during the 12-month intervention. Secondary outcomes 
included falls/fractures, 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, hypercalcemia, and kidney stones.
Results—We randomized 107 participants (55 high dose, 52 standard dose) and included all in 
the final analysis. The high dose group had 0.67 ARIs per person-year compared to 1.11 in the 
standard dose group (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.60; 95%CI 0.38–0.94; p= 0.02). Falls were more 
common in the high dose group (1.47 per person-year) compared to 0.63 in the standard dose 
group (IRR 2.33; 95%CI 1.49–3.63; p<0.001). Fractures were uncommon and similar in both 
groups (high dose 0.10 vs standard dose 0.19 per person-year; p=0.31). The mean 25-
hydroxyvitamin D level during the trial was 32.6 ng/mL in the high dose group and 25.1 ng/mL in 
the standard dose group. There was no hypercalcemia or kidney stones in either group.
Conclusion—Monthly high dose vitamin D3 supplementation reduced the incidence of ARI in 
older long-term care residents but was associated with a higher rate of falls without an increase in 
fractures.

INTRODUCTION
Acute respiratory infection (ARI) is common in older adults and results in important 
morbidity, healthcare utilization, and functional decline.1,2 Older long-term care (LTC) 
residents are particularly vulnerable to increased ARI due to senescent immune responses 
and decreased functional reserve.3,4 Strategies to reduce the incidence and severity of ARI in 
this population are limited, and effective vaccines are lacking for most common respiratory 
pathogens.
Micronutrient deficiencies are common in LTC residents5,6 and can exacerbate age-related 
changes in immune function.7,8 Multivitamin supplementation appears to improve indices of 
immune function,9 but clinical impact on ARI and other infections has been modest.10,11

 Vitamin D has an important role in many aspects of immune function, particularly innate 
immunity.12 Older adults are at high risk for vitamin D deficiency,13 and epidemiologic 
studies demonstrate a consistent association between vitamin D deficiency and ARIs.14,15 
However, clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation for ARI prevention have been mixed, 
with meta-analyses suggesting modest benefit but substantial heterogeneity.15,16 Existing 
trials are limited by the use of relatively low doses for short durations in predominantly 
healthy populations.
Therefore, we conducted a randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
high dose vitamin D3 supplementation for 12 months to reduce the incidence and severity of 
ARI in older LTC residents.
METHODS
Study Design
This study was a double-blinded, parallel group, randomized controlled phase II trial of oral 
high vs. standard dose vitamin D3 supplementation administered monthly for 12 months. 
The trial was conducted from June 2010 to January 2014. The protocol was approved by the 
Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board and supervised by an independent Data Safety 
and Monitoring Board. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant or their 
legally authorized representative (LAR). The trial was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov 
NCT01102374 (see Online Supplement for full protocol).
Eligibility Criteria
Older residents (age ≥60 years) of 25 selected Colorado LTC facilities (skilled nursing or 
assisted living facilities) were eligible for participation. Exclusion criteria included: 1) 
Terminal illness; 2) Anticipated facility discharge within 12 months; 3) Inability to take 
whole/crushed tablets; 4) Active cancer, except squamous/basal cell carcinoma; 5) 
Underweight (body mass index <18 kg/m2); 6) Current immunosuppressive medications; 7) 
Renal failure (eGFR<15 mL/min/1.73m2); 8) Currently taking >1,000 IU/day vitamin D; 9) 
Personal (or strong family) history of kidney stones; 10) History of sarcoidosis or other 
granulomatous disorders; 11) Baseline hypercalcemia (albumin-adjusted calcium >10.5 mg/
dL); 12) Baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) level ≥ 40 ng/mL (to convert to 
nmol/L, multiple by 2.496); 13) Inability of participant or LAR to speak/understand English 
and no available interpreter; 14) Inability to provide informed consent and no available 
healthcare LAR.
Intervention
We randomized participants to one of two vitamin D dose groups: high dose (equivalent to 
3,000–4,000 IU/day) or standard dose (equivalent to 400–1,000 IU/day). The participant’s 
total vitamin D dose included any study drug supplementation plus vitamin D taken as part 
of usual care (0–1,000 IU/day). Because the facilities were not formally ‘engaged’ in the 
research, the study team administered study drug monthly and did not interfere in their usual 
clinical care. Based on Institutional Review Board and Data Safety and Monitoring Board 
recommendations, we ensured that all trial participants received at least 400 IU/day

 equivalent of vitamin D to meet the Institute of Medicine Dietary Reference Intake 
(including typical dietary intake).
Participants already taking 400 – 1,000 IU/day vitamin D as usual care were randomized to 
one of two study drugs: 1) oral 100,000 IU vitamin D3 monthly or 2) matched oral placebo 
monthly, while continuing their usual vitamin D regimen. Participants taking <400 IU/day 
vitamin D supplementation as usual care were also randomized to one of two study drugs: 1) 
oral 100,000 IU vitamin D3 monthly or 2) oral 12,000 IU vitamin D3 monthly, while 
continuing any usual vitamin D regimen. The 12,000 IU/month supplementation ensured at 
least 400 IU/day.
Study drugs were provided by Pencol Compounding Pharmacy (Denver, CO), who 
performed routine testing of study drug content throughout the trial to verify study drug 
content. Vitamin D and placebo were identical in size, weight, color, smell, texture, and 
taste. If necessary, the capsule was opened and sprinkled on food for administration. The 
research pharmacy provided study medication to the research staff in numbered blister 
packs, and the sequence was concealed until interventions were assigned. The protocol and 
study drugs were also under the oversight of the Food and Drug Administration as an 
Investigational New Drug.
Randomization
The research pharmacy (Veterans Affairs Eastern Colorado Research Pharmacy; Denver, 
CO) performed 1:1 randomization in permuted block sizes of 4–8, stratified by site and 
baseline vitamin D supplementation (<400 IU/day or 400–1,000 IU/day). Study personnel, 
outcome assessors, study participants, and treating clinicians were blinded to study group 
assignment, allocation sequence, and baseline 25OHD level (a third party provided 
dichotomous data on eligibility as <40 ng/mL or ≥40 ng/mL). Unblinding was not required 
for any participant during the course of the trial.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was total number of incident ARIs during the 12-month follow-up 
period. We measured both upper (common colds, sinusitis, pharyngitis, otitis media) and 
lower (acute bronchitis, influenza, pneumonia) ARIs that required medical attention (nurse 
or physician assessment and/or new prescribed treatment) by a chart review method 
validated in the LTC setting,17 with additional active surveillance during monthly study 
visits.
The infection-related secondary outcomes included severity of ARIs, as measured by 
emergency department visits or hospitalization for ARIs, time to first ARI, and incidence of 
other infections (categorized as urinary tract, skin/soft tissue, other) during the 12 month 
follow-up period. We also assessed efficacy of the intervention by change in 25OHD levels 
at 3, 7, and 11 months, compared to baseline. Collection of samples for trough 25OHD 
levels occurred just prior to the next monthly dose, and analysis was performed at the 
University of Washington using the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry 
method and accounting for the C-3 epimer of 25OHD. Cryopreserved samples were batch 
tested after trial participation to avoid unblinding and reduce measurement variability.

 The primary safety outcome was incident hypercalcemia defined as albumin-adjusted serum 
calcium >10.5 mg/dL, measured at 3, 7, and 11 months. We also measured incident falls, 
fractures, kidney stones, all-cause hospitalizations, and all-cause death by chart review. At 
monthly medication administration visits, research assistants queried participants and 
clinical staff for new adverse events during. We classified these events using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) hierarchy.
Data Collection
Baseline data collected from chart review and interviews with participants, legally 
authorized representatives, and clinical providers, included: 1) demographics; 2) facility 
length of stay; 3) co-morbid conditions; 4) advanced directives; 5) vaccination status 
(seasonal and H1N1 influenza, pneumococcal); 6) smoking history; 7) body mass index; 8) 
physical activity; and 9) current medications, including vitamin D and calcium 
supplementation. We collected outcome and adverse event data at monthly medication 
administration visits, with expanded data collection, chart review, and blood draws at 3, 7, 
and 11 months.
Statistical Analysis
The primary intention-to-treat analysis measured the effect of randomized treatment group 
(high dose vs. standard dose vitamin D) on the number of incident ARIs observed during the 
follow-up period. We estimated the treatment effect using Poisson regression as performed 
with the PROC GENMOD procedure using SAS® software (SAS 9.3, Cary, NC), expressed 
as the percentage change of the estimated mean number of ARIs for the high dose group 
compared with the standard dose group. Some participants had less than 12 months of 
observation time for reasons such as drop out, death, or lost-to-follow-up. The logarithm of 
the participant time active in the study was included in the model as an offset in order to 
account for the different observation times. We handled secondary analyses of count data in 
a manner similar to the primary outcome of ARI. All outcomes were pre-specified in the 
study protocol. Pre-specified subgroup analyses included age, sex, residence, co-morbidities, 
baseline vitamin D supplementation, BMI, renal function, and completers (defined as ≥11 
out of 12 possible doses of study medication).
Our sample size calculation assumed a control group rate of 1.4 ARIs per person-year and 
an estimated 35% reduction in the high dose vitamin D intervention group. We anticipated 
that 80% of the total possible follow-up time would be obtained (due to censoring). With a 
2-sided type I error rate of 0.05 and 80% power, we planned for a total sample size of 200 
randomized participants (100 per group). In consultation with the DSMB and NIH, 
recruitment for the trial ended at 107 randomized participants, due to the lack of available 
local participants and insufficient resources to expand recruitment beyond the local 
geographic area.

 RESULTS
Participants
From the 1055 LTC residents screened, 107 were eligible and randomized (55 high dose and 
52 standard dose). The primary reason for exclusion was clinician discretion based on their 
knowledge of exclusion criteria and study intervention (Figure 1). The intention-to-treat 
analysis included all 107 randomized participants.
Baseline characteristics of the participants are presented in Table 1. There were modest 
differences in some baseline characteristics with the high dose group having higher mean 
BMI and rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and diabetes but lower 
rates of current smoking, asthma, coronary artery disease, and dementia. Baseline vitamin D 
supplementation and serum 25OHD levels were similar between the two groups.
Vitamin D Intervention
The number of monthly study drug doses received during the 12 months was similar 
between the two treatment groups (high dose group: median 11 [IQR 8–12]; standard dose 
group: median 11 [IQR 6–12]). The mean 25OHD levels increased in both the high dose and 
standard dose vitamin D groups (Figure 2). The mean trough 25OHD levels in the high dose 
group remained greater than the target 30 ng/mL throughout the trial and were significantly 
higher than the standard dose group at every timepoint (p<0.001).
Primary Outcome
The incidence of ARI was lower in the high dose group compared to the standard dose group 
(incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.60; 95%CI 0.38–0.94; p= 0.02). There were 17 (31%) 
participants in the high dose group and 24 (46%) in the standard dose group who had at least 
one ARI (p=0.10). The time to first ARI analysis (Supplementary Figure S1) demonstrates a 
similar effect size as the primary analysis (hazard ratio 0.59; 95%CI 0.32–1.09; p= 0.09).
Secondary Outcomes
The high dose group had a lower incidence of upper ARI (IRR 0.52; 95%CI 0.31–0.90; p= 
0.02) and skin and soft tissue infections (0.32; 95%CI 0.13–0.80; p= 0.02), compared to the 
standard dose group (Table 2). There were no differences in the incidence of lower ARI, 
hospitalizations for ARI, urinary tract infections, or other infections.
No pre-specified vitamin D-related safety outcomes was observed in either group 
(hypercalcemia, kidney stones, hypervitaminosis D). The overall proportion of participants 
with all-cause hospitalizations (46% high dose vs. 43% standard dose) and death (22% vs. 
21%, respectively) was high in both groups of LTC residents, but not different between 
groups.
The high dose group had a higher incidence of falls, compared to the standard dose group 
(IRR 2.33; 95%CI 1.49–3.63; p<0.001). At least 1 fall during the follow-up period was 
recorded for 20 (36%) of participants in the high dose group and 15 (29%) in the standard 
dose group (p=0.41). Similarly, the time to first fall analysis (Supplementary Figure S2) 
Ginde et al.

 demonstrated no marked difference between groups (hazard ratio 1.34; 95%CI 0.68–2.59; 
p= 0.41). Thus, the overall difference in fall incidence appeared to be driven by participants 
with multiple recorded falls.
The overall incidence of fractures was low and did not differ between groups (IRR 0.56; 
95%CI 0.18–1.71; p= 0.31) with one or more fractures in 4 (7%) of high dose group 
participants and 8 (15%) of standard dose group participants (p=0.18).
Adverse Events
There were no significant between-group differences in the recorded adverse events overall 
or by MedDRA groups (Supplementary Table S1).
Subgroup Analyses
Pre-specified subgroup analyses of the primary ARI outcome is displayed in Figure 3, along 
with post-hoc subgroup analyses for the secondary fall outcome. The following subgroups 
had a significantly lower incidence of ARI among those assigned to high dose vs standard 
dose: baseline vitamin D supplementation <400 IU, baseline 25OHD level ≥20 ng/mL, ≥11 
study medication doses received, age ≥80 years, type of LTC residence, dementia, and 
eGFR≥60 mL/min/1.73m2. The following subgroups had a particularly high observed 
incidence of falls in the high dose vs. standard dose group: baseline vitamin D 
supplementation ≥400 IU, ≥11 study medication doses received, age <80 years, dementia, 
and BMI ≥25 kg/m2.
DISCUSSION
In this double-blinded, phase II randomized control trial, older LTC residents receiving 
monthly high dose vitamin D supplementation had a 40% lower incidence of ARI during the 
12 month follow-up period, compared to those receiving standard dose vitamin D. While 
there were no observed safety concerns for hypercalcemia, hypervitaminosis D, kidney 
stones, hospitalizations, death, or fractures, there was a markedly higher incidence of falls in 
participants assigned to the high dose vitamin D group, driven by participants with multiple 
falls.
To our knowledge, this is the first trial to evaluate high dose vitamin D supplementation for 
prevention of ARI in older LTC residents. Secondary analyses of two randomized controlled 
trials suggest that 800 IU per day vitamin D supplementation had modest benefit in 
preventing ARI in older adults.18,19 Tran et al reported that 60,000 IU monthly vitamin D 
reduced antibiotic use in community dwelling adults aged ≥70 years.20 However, these were 
post-hoc analyses of trials designed for other purposes. In a recent randomized trial, 
Martineau et al found that 96,000 IU vitamin D every 2 months to residential care facility 
residents in the U.K. did not influence the incidence of ARI.21 However, these participants 
were younger and healthier than our population of older LTC residents and received half the 
dose used in our trial.
Although not a primary focus of this trial, falls are also an important cause of morbidity in 
older adults. There is growing interest regarding the role of vitamin D in fall prevention,

 relating to muscle function and balance. The American Geriatrics Society consensus 
statement recommends 1,000–4,000 IU daily of vitamin D supplementation for fall 
prevention in older adults.22 Indeed, recruitment into our trial was challenging because of 
clinician use of high dose vitamin D for usual care of many older LTC residents. However, 
we found that participants in the high dose group had a 2.3-fold higher incidence of falls. 
The mechanism of this finding requires further investigation, including the hypothesis that 
high dose vitamin D leads to increased mobility resulting in greater exposure to falls. Two 
prior trials of high, intermittent doses of vitamin D (500,000 IU annually and 60,000 IU 
monthly) in older community dwelling adults have also reported a higher fall rates in the 
intervention group.23,24 Although higher rates of fractures have not been reported in our trial 
nor these 2 prior trials, increased falls from these 3 trials call into question the potential 
safety of high, intermittent doses of vitamin D for older adults. We used this dosing 
paradigm to reduce the need to deliver daily study doses to these LTC residents. There 
remains equipoise for daily high dose vitamin D supplementation and fall prevention in 
older adults, which is the focus of an ongoing phase III trial (NCT02166333).
Several other secondary and subgroup analyses could have important clinical implications, 
meriting further investigation. The incidence of skin and soft tissue infections was lower in 
the high dose group and is an underexplored infectious outcome in vitamin D trials. High 
dose vitamin D may be particularly effective in ARI prevention for patients with COPD, 
which has important clinical implications due to ARI-associated disease exacerbation. 
Several recent clinical trials support the potential for high dose vitamin D to improve COPD 
outcomes, particularly those with severe disease and severe vitamin D deficiency.25–27
The results of this trial should be interpreted in the context of several limitations. The 
sample size was modest and did not reach goal recruitment; this impacts the trial power and 
precision. However, outcome data did not influence the decision to end the trial, limiting the 
potential for bias and type 1 error. Modest differences in some baseline characteristics may 
have influenced results, although subgroup analyses suggest that this was unlikely. We 
selected intermittent bolus dosing largely for feasibility, and the regimen is not physiologic 
relative to daily dosing. We did not measure or adjust for baseline fall history, and thus the 
higher rate of total falls in the high dose group may have been driven by imbalance in the 
number of frequent fallers in this group. However, as others have also observed higher falls 
with high, intermittent doses of vitamin D, we recommend equivalent daily doses be tested 
in future trials for ARI prevention in this population. Due to ethical concerns to ensure at 
least standard amounts of vitamin D for the control group in this vulnerable population, 
there was no true placebo group. This may have reduced the effect size for some outcomes 
of interest. In addition, some missed doses of study medication (due to logistical issues/
hospitalizations) may have also led to regression to the mean. The observed rise in 25OHD 
levels was not as robust as anticipated, which may have mitigated potential benefits (as well 
as risks) of high dose supplementation. Indeed, completers (those receiving ≥11 out of 12 
possible doses of study medication) appeared to have a more robust signal for ARI 
prevention and higher fall incidence.
In summary, monthly high dose vitamin D supplementation reduced the incidence of ARI 
but increased falls, without an increase in fractures, in older LTC residents. If our results are

 confirmed by a larger trial, high dose vitamin D, ideally using daily dosing to minimize fall 
risk, has the potential for substantial public health benefit through ARI prevention for the 
large and growing population of LTC residents.
