Abstract
Background: Interventions need to be developed prior to the feasibility and piloting phase of a study. There are a
variety of published approaches to developing interventions, programmes or innovations to improve health.
Identifying different types of approach, and synthesising the range of actions taken within this endeavour, can
inform future intervention development.
Methods: This study is a systematic methods overview of approaches to intervention development. Approaches
were considered for inclusion if they described how to develop or adapt an intervention in a book, website or
journal article published after 2007, or were cited in a primary research study reporting the development of a
specific intervention published in 2015 or 2016. Approaches were read, a taxonomy of approaches was developed
and the range of actions taken across different approaches were synthesised.
Results: Eight categories of approach to intervention development were identified. (1) Partnership, where people
who will use the intervention participate equally with the research team in decision-making about the intervention
throughout the development process. (2) Target population-centred, where the intervention is based on the views
and actions of the people who will use it. (3) Evidence and theory-based, where the intervention is based on
published research evidence and existing theories. (4) Implementation-based, where the intervention is developed
with attention to ensuring it will be used in the real world. (5) Efficiency-based, where components of an
intervention are tested using experimental designs to select components which will optimise efficiency. (6) Stepped
or phased, where interventions are developed with an emphasis on following a systematic set of processes. (7)
Intervention-specific, where an approach is constructed for a specific type of intervention. (8) Combination, where
existing approaches to intervention development are formally combined. The actions from approaches in all eight
categories were synthesised to identify 18 actions to consider when developing interventions.
Conclusions: This overview of approaches to intervention development can help researchers to understand the
variety of existing approaches, and to understand the range of possible actions involved in intervention
development, prior to assessing feasibility or piloting the intervention. Findings from this overview will contribute
to future guidance on intervention development.

 Background
Policy makers, health professionals, patient groups, the
public, designers and researchers develop interventions,
programmes or innovations to improve health. It is im-
portant that the intervention development process maxi-
mises the chances that an intervention will be effective
and sustainable. Unless it does, there is a risk of research
waste [1], where expensive evaluations are undertaken of
flawed interventions that turn out not to be feasible, ac-
ceptable or effective in subsequent feasibility studies or
fully powered evaluations [2].
In recent years, researchers have published journal ar-
ticles, websites and books on how to develop interven-
tions. This international endeavour, proposing ways of
developing interventions that others can follow, could be
described as the production of guides, guidance, meth-
odology or frameworks. In this article, the umbrella term
‘approaches’ is used. These approaches are distinct from
publications describing the development of a specific
intervention. Approaches that show how to develop in-
terventions are useful for those new to intervention de-
velopment. They offer an opportunity for research
communities to refine and improve those approaches for
future use.
There are a variety of approaches to intervention de-
velopment and it is timely to bring these together and
synthesise them to understand the range of actions avail-
able. Previous reviews of intervention development have
focused on identifying approaches used in the specific
context of behaviour change in implementation science
[3], optimisation in terms of making final modifications
to interventions prior to formal evaluation [4], the use of
theory in intervention development for a single condi-
tion [5] and ways of adapting interventions for ethnic
minority communities [6].
Complex interventions are widely used to improve
health. These interventions have multiple interacting
components, target multiple groups or levels of an or-
ganisation and attempt to affect multiple outcomes [7].
The United Kingdom Medical Research Council (MRC)
is widely cited for its guidance on developing and evalu-
ating complex interventions [7], describing the four
phases of developing, feasibility/piloting, evaluation and
implementation. One part of the guidance has been ex-
tended recently to offer more detail on process evalu-
ation [8]. Guidance on the feasibility/piloting phase is
currently being extended, following recent publication of
a systematic review of existing guidance for this phase
[9]. Some researchers have considered enhancements to
the development phase of the MRC guidance for the
specific field of nursing studies [10]. The MRC has
funded a study to produce guidance on intervention de-
velopment:
‘IdentifyiNg
and
assessing
different
ap-
proaches to DEveloping compleX interventions (the
INDEX study). As part of the INDEX study [11], a sys-
tematic review of approaches to intervention develop-
ment
was
undertaken
to
identify
the
range
of
approaches available, and to synthesise the actions
within these approaches, in order to help researchers to
develop complex interventions and to inform future
guidance on intervention development.
Methods
Systematic methods overview
Systematic
methods
overviews
are
reviews
of
the
methods literature [12–14]. Guidance has been pub-
lished
to
help
researchers to
undertake
systematic
methods overviews [14]. This guidance was followed to
undertake a systematic methods overview of different
approaches to developing complex interventions. Ex-
haustive searching and inclusion of all relevant literature
associated with systematic reviews of primary research is
not necessary because learning and arguments about
methodology and methods are repeated frequently in the
literature. Instead, there is an emphasis on broad search-
ing to identify the range of relevant literature, and on
data saturation of learning and arguments [12, 13]. The
protocol

The aim of the overview
The aim of this overview was to identify a broad range
of approaches to intervention development. The em-
phasis was on recently produced or recently used ap-
proaches, because of the rapid development of this field,
with newer approaches building explicitly on older ap-
proaches. The objectives were to construct a taxonomy
of approaches to help future developers think about the
approach they might take, and to synthesise the actions
within each approach to identify the full range of actions
developers can consider.
Definitions used in this overview
Intervention
A health intervention is an effort, activity or combin-
ation of programme elements designed to improve
health status. This overview focuses on complex inter-
ventions that include a number of components which
may act both independently and inter-dependently. This
includes policy innovations such as introducing a new
health service or public health policy nationally (e.g.
smoking ban in public places). It does not include the
development of medicines and any invasive interven-
tions (e.g. pills, procedures, devices). Complex interven-
tions to improve health or health care outcomes can be
delivered in many settings including health care facil-
ities, schools, local communities or national populations.
They can be delivered by a range of individuals including
O’Cathain et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:41 
Page 2 of 27
 health care, social care and public health practitioners,
as well as professionals working outside of the health
care sector, such as teachers, charity workers and peers.
Intervention development
Craig et al. [15] proposed the development phase to be
the period when the ‘intervention must be developed to
the point where it can reasonably be expected to have a
worthwhile effect’. (p. 9). The start and end points of the
development phase are not always clear. There may be
overlap between the development phase and the subse-
quent phase of feasibility and piloting, because some ex-
ploration of feasibility is often part of the intervention
development process [16]. A helpful indicator of the end
of the development phase is the production of a docu-
ment or manual describing the intervention and how it
should be delivered [16]. There may also be overlap be-
tween the intensive development phase and a longer
period of preparation prior to intervention development,
when a team undertakes a series of studies over a num-
ber of years before the point of formally developing an
intervention. This may involve assessment of the evi-
dence base, including reviewing the effectiveness of
existing interventions, and/or qualitative research with
stakeholders. Alternatively, these studies may be under-
taken as part of the intensive intervention development
phase. This overview focuses on the intensive develop-
ment phase, recognising that the start and end of this
phase may be hard to define.
Refinement, optimisation, modification and adaptation
During the development process, the initial version of
the intervention may be repeatedly refined by making
improvements based on early assessment of feasibility
and acceptability. This process continues throughout the
formal feasibility/pilot testing and evaluation phases (see
Fig. 1). Indeed, some researchers see intervention devel-
opment as a long-term ongoing endeavour which lasts
throughout
the
full
evaluation
and
implementation
phases [17]. Early refinement, during the development
phase, is included in this overview but later refinement,
during or after the formal pilot phase of an evaluation, is
excluded.
Intervention optimisation is the process of improving
the efficiency of an intervention. Different components
are assessed to identify those affecting intermediate out-
comes, so that only effective components are included in
the intervention to be fully evaluated. A recent review of
optimisation of complex health interventions prior to a
full trial has been published [4]. Approaches to optimisa-
tion are therefore not a focus of this overview unless
their authors frame them specifically as approaches to
intervention development.
Sometimes researchers take interventions that have
been shown to be effective at the evaluation phase, and
perhaps implemented in the real world, and adapt them
for a new sub-population, health condition or context
(Fig. 1); for example, an existing effective intervention
might be adapted for ethnic minority communities [6].
Such adaptation may involve a formal development
phase, so approaches to adaptation are included in this
overview if they are framed by their authors as interven-
tion development.
An ‘approach’ to intervention development
‘Approach’ refers to the whole process of intervention
development documented in a book, website or journal
article where authors explicitly offer a guide to undertak-
ing intervention development. Approaches may provide
different amounts of detail about how to develop an
intervention. All are included in this overview regardless
of the amount of detail offered.
Development versus design
Sometimes researchers use the terms ‘development’ and
‘design’ interchangeably. In this overview, the term ‘de-
velopment’ is used for the whole process of intervention
development and the term ‘design’ is reserved for a point
in the development process where developers make de-
cisions about the intervention content, format and
delivery.
Search
The focus of systematic methods overviews can in-
clude the literature describing or critiquing methods
or methodology, and the methods sections of primary
research papers [14]. The focus of this overview is re-
cent literature documenting how to develop an inter-
vention. Approaches were considered for inclusion if
they describe how to develop an intervention in a
book, website or journal articles published after 2007,
or are cited in a primary research study reporting the
development of a specific intervention published in
2015 or 2016.
In systematic methods overviews, the search strategy
should be transparent and broad rather than exhaustive
[13, 14]. The process started with a primary search of
the databases Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ASSIA and
ERIC from January 2015 to December 2016 using the
single search term ‘intervention development’. These
health, social science and education databases were se-
lected because they include research on complex inter-
ventions
with
health
outcomes.
Title
and
abstract
screening, followed by full text search, identified journal
articles reporting primary research of the development
of specific interventions. The methods sections of these
articles were read by KS and AOC in order to identify
O’Cathain et al. Pilot and Feasibility Studies            (2019) 5:41 
Page 3 of 27
 any intervention development approaches that were
used and referenced. The most up-to-date version of
journal articles, books or websites referenced in these ar-
ticles were obtained for data extraction. This search also
identified articles describing approaches, and systematic
reviews of approaches, to intervention development. Be-
cause the search term ‘intervention development’ was
simple and potentially limited the breadth of approaches
identified, a check was undertaken with a second search
using a broader set of search terms to see if this yielded
a broader set of approaches. A set of diverse terms asso-
ciated with intervention development were searched in
the same databases in the same time period: complex
behavioural intervention, develop, design, phase I, ex-
ploratory,
refine
and
translate.
This
identified
808
records. AOC and KS conducted a title and abstract
screen on a sample of records from this search: the first
100 records and 1 in every 8 records. Allowing for over-
lap, this identified 189 records. The full texts of 26 met
the inclusion criteria and did not identify further ap-
proaches to intervention development. Both search strat-
egies are detailed in Additional file 1.
Searching should go beyond standard bibliographic da-
tabases because methodologies/methods are described in
books as well as in journal articles [14]. The formal
search described above was supplemented by a search in
Google Scholar using the terms ‘intervention develop-
ment’
, ‘complex intervention development’
, ‘intervention
optimisation’
, ‘complex intervention pre-clinical’
, ‘inter-
vention
adaptation’
and
‘intervention
modification’.

Page 4 of 27
 Different terms to those used in the searches of data-
bases were used deliberately to facilitate broad searching.
Finally, the authors of this overview drew on their exist-
ing reference libraries because use of personal know-
ledge is also important in reviews of complex evidence
[18].
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Approaches were considered for inclusion if they pre-
sented a guide to developing an intervention that had
been produced or updated since 2007 or used in primary
research published 2015–2016. A purposeful approach
to selection of literature is advocated in systematic
methods overviews, with use of maximum variation
sampling. The inclusion of literature stops when new is-
sues no longer emerge. As approaches were identified,
members of the team (AOC, LC, KS) inductively devel-
oped a taxonomy of approaches. Data saturation was
considered and further approaches not included if the
team considered that saturation was reached. For ex-
ample, not all approaches to developing digital interven-
tions were included because they repeated the actions
already identified within that category of approach. At-
tention was also paid to diversity of context within each
category and across all categories in the emerging tax-
onomy. This process was led by AOC with team discus-
sions with LC and KS.
Data extraction
For each approach, AOC read the article, website or
book and extracted the rationale stated by authors for
the approach, the context for which the approach was
constructed, the key actions undertaken, the methods
used to deliver each action and the strengths and limita-
tions of the approach. These strengths and limitations
were identified by the authors of the approach, the au-
thors of other approaches included in the overview or
the research team (indicated by ‘INDEX’).
Quality appraisal
Quality appraisal is a challenge in these overviews [14].
There was no formal assessment of the quality of the ap-
proaches to intervention development because assess-
ment criteria do not exist.
Analysis
The constant comparative method has been recom-
mended for synthesising within systematic methods
overviews [14]. Most overviews are aggregative in terms
of bringing together different concepts, rather than in-
terpretative in terms of developing new concepts [14]. A
constant comparative aggregative approach was under-
taken within three concurrent steps:
(i) AOC extracted data on rationale, context, key
actions, methods and strengths and limitations to
summarise each approach within a table.
(ii) AOC developed a taxonomy of approaches. AOC
grouped approaches together based on the stated
rationales for each approach because these convey
the intentions of the authors. These rationales were
extracted from statements made by the authors
when introducing their approach. The categories of
approach, and the individual approaches included
within them, were discussed and refined by AOC,
LC and KS until an agreed taxonomy was
produced.
(iii)AOC listed the actions from each approach,
grouped similar actions and brought these together
to identify a comprehensive set of actions from all
the categories of approach, including the methods
that could be used at each action. AOC, LC and KS
discussed these actions until agreement was
reached.
Results
Approaches identified and included
As previously stated, the intention was to undertake a
broad rather than an exhaustive search, where more in-
formal searches are as important as formal searches.
PRISMA flow charts are devised to display exhaustive
searches within standard systematic reviews. For this
systematic methods overview, a PRISMA flow chart is
displayed for the search using the term ‘intervention de-
velopment’ of primary studies reporting intervention de-
velopment in 2015–2016 (Fig. 1).
Taxonomy of approaches
Eight categories of approach to intervention develop-
ment were identified, distinguished by the rationales
stated by the authors of these approaches (Table 1). The
review team identified the following labels for these
eight categories based on the language used by authors
of approaches.
1. Partnership intervention development. Three
approaches were included, addressing a range of
contexts (quality improvement, social innovation
and radical innovation). Partnership approaches
included co-production with equal participation in
decision-making of the research team and the
people whom the intervention aimed to help, and
user-driven development. Due to similarities with
approaches already included, a partnership ap-
proach for implementation science was not in-
cluded [19]. Primary research studies reported using
community-based participatory research but articles
or books describing how to use this approach for

 intervention development could not be located so it
was not included here.
2. Target population-centred intervention develop-
ment. Three approaches were included, address-
ing a wide range of contexts (health care
delivery, technology, behaviour change and self-
management).
3. Evidence and theory-based intervention develop-
ment. Six approaches were included, addressing a
range of contexts (complex interventions in health
and health care, public health, social policy, behav-
iour change and quality improvement). Some of
these approaches also proposed a rationale of being
systematic (see category 6) but were included in this

 category because they emphasised the role of evi-
dence and theory within their rationale. There were
a large number of these. Some approaches identified
in the primary research study search were not in-
cluded here due to data saturation [20, 21].
4. Implementation-based intervention development.
One approach was included, in the context of
health behaviour interventions.
5. Efficiency-based intervention development. Three
approaches were included, although they were not
independent of each other. Two of the approaches
defined different ways of optimising components for
parts in the first approach in this category.
6. Stepped or phased-based intervention development.
Three approaches were included, addressing a range
of contexts (public health, social policy and clinical
practice).
7. Intervention-specific development. Five approaches
were included in three intervention groups—digital
behaviour change interventions, patient decision
aids and group interventions. Other approaches
were identified but not included here because of
data saturation, because they were outside the time
range of post 2007 and had not been used in the
primary research studies published 2015–2016 [22],
or because they offered recommendations for the
future rather than current guidance [23].
8. Combination approach to intervention
development. There was one approach included
here in the context of behaviour change.
The stated rationale, context, key actions and strengths
and limitations of each included approach are described
in Table 2 and these characteristics are considered
below.
Contexts
The approaches included were produced for a wide
range of contexts and sometimes for multiple contexts.
They addressed the contexts of behaviour change (11
approaches), public health and health promotion (9),
digital health (6), complex interventions (5), quality or
service improvement (3), clinical research (2), social pol-
icy or innovation (2) and others (Table 2).
Key actions
The actions from all the included approaches were syn-
thesised to identify a total of 18 actions. These actions
are displayed in seven domains of intervention develop-
ment. Although some authors describe intervention de-
velopment as a broadly sequential process, in that some
actions are usually undertaken prior to others [24], au-
thors also emphasise that intervention development is a
cyclical or iterative rather than linear process (for
example, action four may generate understanding that
takes developers back to action two), or there may be
repetition within a single action until the developers are
ready to move on to the next action [15, 17, 25–31].
Some actions may be undertaken concurrently. There-
fore, the actions are presented within domains, with
some attention to broad sequencing of domains and ac-
tions, to facilitate understanding of the process of inter-
vention development. The seven domains are presented
in three tables (Tables 3, 4 and 5) and described below.
Authors of some approaches state that intervention
development is a cumulative or progressive process, ar-
guing that it is necessary to spend time on the early ac-
tions and get this right because later ones depend on
these [26].
Conception and planning
The first two domains of intervention development are
Conception and Planning (Table 3). Although the Con-
ception domain has only one action, it emphasises the
importance of being transparent about where the idea
for an intervention has originated. The Planning domain
has seven actions, from deciding who will be involved in
the development process and how, through to consider-
ing whether it is worthwhile designing an intervention
(Table 3). Authors of some approaches identify the need
to spend resources on the Planning domain to get the
intervention right (e.g. [32]).
Designing and creating
The next two domains of intervention development are
Designing an intervention and then Creating it (Table 4).
The Creating domain can be an integral action within
the Designing domain in some approaches. Two ways of
addressing both of these domains have been proposed:
one prioritises working with stakeholders, particularly
the target population, and the other focuses on theory.
Constructing a rough prototype early in these domains
is key to some approaches. These domains require cre-
ativity [24, 33, 34], with use of a multidisciplinary team
proposed as a way to maximise idea generation and
innovation [30, 34].
Refining, documenting and planning for future evaluation
The final three domains are Refining, Documenting and
Planning for Future Evaluation (see Table 5). The Refining
domain starts by testing early versions of the intervention
on a small sample, and asking whether it merits more
rigorous and costly testing [34] before moving to testing
on a diverse sample to improve external validity [17, 27].
Some approaches consider this domain to be part of the
process of optimising the intervention and propose the
use of mixed methods research as necessary [17, 27].

[40]. It can also be seen
as ‘user-led innovation’
[39]. Requires a shift in

Six steps:
1. Identify and build an

important to the service,
developing inclusive

processes. Use joint and
equal involvement of
staff, patients,
researchers, people
leading improvement,

4. Co-design the solution
using qualitative re-
search, rapid ethnog-
raphy and prototyping.
Use tools to generate
creative thinking. Open
up a range of potential

6. Measure outcomes
together and plan this as
an integral part of the
process
There are examples of
changes made to
services based on this
approach [25] and
reductions in the cost of
health care provision
[40]
Studies what people do
rather than what they
say they do [39]
A detailed guide is
available [40]
Attention has not been
paid to the outcomes of
co-creation [38]
Quantitative methods
need to be used
because qualitative
evaluation of co-creation
is dominant [38]
[38] is a systematic
review of the use of co-
creation discussing dif-
ferent levels of involve-
ment of end users
including co-design (the
developers lead the
process in partnership
with the end users), co-
implementation (end
users implement a ser-
vice with formal service
providers) and initiation
(end users develop and
implement innovation).
They offer insights into
the process rather than a
tool-kit (INDEX)
User-driven [25]
A participatory approach
goes beyond user-
centred design, with
users as active partici-
pants in generating de-
sign ideas and decision-
making. In co-operative
design, users and de-
signers work together to
come up with a design
and further refinements.
In user-driven design,
the users lead the cre-
ative thinking and the
designers facilitate the
process.
End user involvement is
critical to the adoption
of information systems
because it increases
functionality and the
quality of the system
Involvement empowers
users
Information systems
in health
Proposes three levels of
participation in design:
user-centred (see next
group in this table), co-
operative (see co-
production earlier) and
user-driven.
Important activities
include:
1. Establish co-operation
between users and
designers
2. Gain insight into
current problems and
needs and generating
visions for future
solutions. This may
involve ‘design games’
to free minds and
creativity.
3. Continual and iterative
input from end users
4. Develop prototypes
and undertake usability
Can be low cost and
rapid and thus increase
dissemination of new
designs [25]
Shown to be successful
at improving future
prototypes and
preventing the
introduction of systems
that fail [25]
How, when and where
to engage users remains
open to question [25]
Ensuring the users
involved are
representative of the
target population is
challenging [25]
Reaching consensus
when there are differing
voices is challenging [25]
Difficult for clinical staff
to give time for design
but there are ways of
working rapidly to
alleviate this [25]
The ‘interventions’ are
not necessarily intended
for evaluation in an RCT
but may be used
immediately in the real
world (INDEX)

5. Bring the users who
were observed using the
prototypes into further
design meetings for
active participation in
refinement of prototype
Experienced
based co-design
(EBCD) and
accelerated
experience
based co-design
(AEBCD) [41, 42]
Need in-depth patient
experience (narrative) to
take action and make
improvements to
services
Patient accounts
generate priorities and
solutions that service
providers may not think
of
Patient narratives can
help patients and staff
reflect on how to
improve services and
establish an emotional
connection between
staff and patients
Patients as equal
partners in co-design
can generate
improvement
AEBCD is more feasible
than EBCD in the
complex cash-strapped
real world and offers a
rigorous and effective
approach to quality
improvement
Service
improvement
specific to a single
service in a single
setting
Core ‘strands’ are:
-Participatory action
research
-User centred
-Reflective practice
-Narrative
There are six steps in
two phases:
Phase 1 Discovery
1. Project management
established
2. Local staff are
interviewed about their
experiences.
3. Local patients are
interviewed about
experiences to produce
a ‘trigger film/video’ to
prompt discussion
amongst patients and
staff about
improvements needed.
In AEBCD, the film is
based on a national
archive rather than
gathering local patient
experiences. Patients and
carers are invited to view
the video and identify
priorities.
Phase 2 co-design where
family, patients and staff
are equal partners in
small working groups
4. The priorities of staff
and patients, and the
video, are considered by
patients, carers and staff
in a workshop meeting
to identify priorities for
improvement.
5. Small co-design
groups established to
implement
improvements.
6. Small groups re-
convene to celebrate
and review progress.
Draws on rigorous
narrative-based research
with a broad sample of
patients rather than a
narrow group of people
[42]
Active partnership
between patients and
staff and focus on
tangible results
produces results [42]
Evaluation shown to be
successful at producing
improvements in the
target service and in
wider aspects of the
hospital [42]
Hospitals commit
investment to doing this
again so they see it as
successful [42]
Online training toolkit is
available (INDEX)
Discovery phase is time
consuming so not
practical in real world of
health care. Therefore,
AEBCD preferable [42]
Some patients found the
video more negative
than their own
experiences; there was a
heavy workload for local
facilitators but they
obtained wider benefits
such as capacity building
[42]
Useful for local service
improvement rather
than developing a

‘guiding principles’ to
guide intervention
development. These
elements are used at
four stages of the
process:
1. At the planning stage
undertake synthesis of
qualitative studies or
qualitative research to
prioritise what is
important or identify
new components of an
intervention
2. At the design stage
identify the intervention
objectives and features
of the intervention
required to deliver them
3. When the prototype is
available, evaluate
acceptability and
feasibility
4. Implement in real life
setting to further modify
intervention
Advantage over co-
design is that people are
basing views on actual
use of the intervention

centred approach used

Early and continuous
stakeholder
engagement, including
having stakeholders as
part of research team to
undertake contextual
inquiry. Three phases:
Phase I Defining design
requirements: Use of role
play and observation to
identify issues rather
than only qualitative
interviews; develop
prototypes to get
specific views on the
intervention
Phase II Develop a
prototype and refine in
iterative interviews: e.g.
rank priority of concepts;
converse with
stakeholders to improve
fit
Phase III Evaluate
stakeholder preferences:
e.g. compare with
alternatives and get
quantitative feedback,
card sorting of
statements to obtain
views

Spending time

systematically based on
evidence and theory

which have a reasonable
chance of having a
worthwhile effect
Complex
interventions in
health care, public
health and social
policy
Three functions:
1. Identifying the
evidence base
2. Identifying/developing
theory
3. Modelling process and
outcomes
Questions are also
identified for researchers
to ask themselves, such
as ‘Have you used this
theory systematically to
develop the
intervention?’ and ‘Can
you describe the
intervention fully, so that
it can be implemented
properly for the
purposes of your
evaluation, and
replicated by others?’
Not prescriptive [7]

2. Identify intervention
options that will bring
about change

Health promotion
Behaviour change
complex health
interventions
A matrix is determined
by a small group of
expert researchers
focused on a specific
behaviour change for a
specific age group, e.g.
promoting physical
activity in older adults.
The experts create a
matrix of personal and
environmental
mechanisms that
promote positive
behaviour, relevant
theories and functions of
an intervention that
could address each
mechanism. This matrix
can then be used by
practitioners to develop
a theory-driven and
evidence-based
intervention
It undertakes one part of
intervention
development for
behaviour change so
that developers do not
have to understand
psychological theory in
depth (INDEX)

The RE-AIM Planning
Tool [48] is a series of
questions which serve as
a checklist for key issues
to consider when plan-
ning an intervention. The
questions are within five
groups:
1. Planning to improve
reach to the target
population
2. Planning for
effectiveness
3. Planning to improve
adoption by target staff,
settings, or institutions
4. Planning to improve
implementation
5. Planning to improve
maintenance of
intervention effects in
individuals and settings
over time
The approach has been
used to evaluate and
report a wide range of
interventions [48]
The emphasis on
developing interventions
that will be used in the
real world if effective is
complementary to some
existing approaches to
intervention
development (INDEX)

 designs for optimising the intervention. A number of ap-
proaches recommend iterative processes, as new insights
emerge and changes are made to the intervention.
The Documenting domain involves writing a set of in-
structions so others can use the intervention. The com-
pilation of this document or manual is likely to start
early in the process and be finalised towards the end of
the development process. The document or manual, like
the intervention, is likely to undergo multiple iterations
during the development process and be further refined
after any formal pilot or evaluation. The description of
the intervention in any document can follow guidelines
for reporting interventions: why, what, who provides,
how, where, when and how much, and tailoring [35].
Some approaches recommend planning for an even-
tual evaluation from the beginning of the development
process [24, 27].
Methods and activities used in the development process
Authors of different approaches propose using different
research methods and activities to deliver each action
(Tables 3, 4 and 5). Methods and activities include using
non-participant observation to understand the problem
and the context in which the intervention will operate,
playing games to generate ideas for the content of the
intervention
and
using
‘think
aloud’
methods
to
understand the usability, acceptability or feasibility of
early versions of the intervention.
Strengths and limitations of approaches
The strengths of each approach, reported largely by its
authors, included those related to processes (that they
are systematic, practical, clear or detailed) and outcomes
(that they have been used a number of times, or there is
evidence that they have produced effective interven-
tions). Authors did not formally compare their approach
with others. Limitations, again reported largely by au-
thors, included that some approaches lacked detail, were
time consuming to undertake, required expertise or did
not address how to deal with conflicting opinions from
diverse stakeholders. These strengths and limitations are
further detailed below.
Comprehensiveness
Some of the approaches were more comprehensive than
others in addressing a higher proportion of the 18 ac-
tions (Table 6). More comprehensive approaches in-
cluded Intervention Mapping and the Behaviour Change
Wheel. Some offered more detail about how to under-
take specific actions because they were published as
books or included a lot of examples. These included

 Table 3 Synthesis of actions in conception and planning (based on all approaches in taxonomy)
Domain
Action
Methods
1. Conception 1. Identify that there is a
problem in need of a new
intervention [28, 29, 33, 34]
Authors of stepped or phased approaches to intervention development
start by describing how a problem has been identified. The existence of
a problem may be identified from published evidence synthesis, clinical
practice, political strategy or needs assessment [28]. Alternatively,
researchers or practitioners may have worked in a field for many years
and identified the need for a new intervention [29]. In a clinical setting,
the clinical significance of the problem, and the ability to make a
clinically significant difference, is identified as the driver for selection of
problems in need of a new intervention [34].
2. Planning
2. Establish a group or set of
groups to guide the development
process, thinking about engagement
of relevant stakeholders such as the
public, patients, practitioners and policy
makers [27, 31, 34, 39–41, 53, 54]
Authors of a range of categories of intervention development explicitly
consider the number, membership and role of groups that need to be
established and run throughout the whole development process. Some
authors recommend that a group is established that has ‘editorial rights’
(that is, makes final decisions about the intervention) and other groups
are established that may deliver any technical expertise needed or offer
advice and expertise for decision-making [31]. The ‘editorial rights’
group—sometimes called ‘the development team’—includes the devel-
opers and, in some approaches, includes members of the target popula-
tion at which the intervention is aimed and practitioners likely to deliver
it. Authors of user-centred approaches recommend including a variety of
disciplines and expertise in this development team to generate
innovation [33, 43]. Authors of stepped or phased approaches also rec-
ommend diverse membership to facilitate the development process, e.g.
include people with computer science skills when designing digital inter-
ventions [34, 53].
In partnership approaches, the development team includes a diverse
range of stakeholders, particularly members of the target population,
who are equal partners with other team members, that is, have editorial
rights [39, 40]. Those leading the intervention development will make
efforts to encourage engagement of members of the target population,
especially of hard-to-reach groups, develop inclusive communication pro-
cesses for the group, and consider the assets (knowledge, experience,
skills and abilities, influence and connections) available within the group
[40]. This focus on bringing a variety of stakeholders together, and collab-
orative working with the target population and those who will deliver
the intervention, is not unique to partnership approaches. Authors of
some theory and evidence based approaches value this, working with a
‘planning group’ throughout the process, and seeking consensus after
open discussion of diverse views [27]. Membership of these groups may
change over time as the intervention, its target population, and who will
deliver it become clear [24]. However, a unique aspect of partnership ap-
proaches is that members of the target population have decision-making
rights throughout the development process.
3. Understand the problems or issues
to be addressed
Different authors address this action in different ways (see below). For
partnership and target population-based approaches the focus is on in-
depth understanding of the target population and the context in which
the intervention will be delivered. For theory and evidence-based ap-
proaches this understanding is gained from theory and published re-
search. Some approaches include both of these strategies but may place
different weights on them. There are five sub-actions (i)-(v).
(i) Understand the experiences, perspectives and
psycho-social context of the potential target population
The target population may be clients, patients, staff or
a combination of these. This can involve identifying
the priorities and needs of the potential target population,
what matters most to people rather than what is the
matter with them, why people behave as they do and
understanding the lived experience of the potential
target population [17, 25, 27, 30, 33, 34, 39–42, 44,
45, 53, 54, 56]
Some authors highlight this as the first action in the process and one
that shapes the whole process [30, 33]. It is central to partnership and
target population centred approaches where understanding the lived
experiences and needs of the target population is the basis of the
intervention. Secondary and primary qualitative research is
recommended: synthesis of qualitative research; iterative qualitative
research using diverse samples and open questions to explore people’s
experiences and needs; use of patients’ narratives or archives of patient
experiences and observation; consultation with stakeholders; and use of
patient and public involvement [17, 41, 42]. Use of observation or
‘shadowing’ patients and families is recommended as well as obtaining
the views of the target population because people may not be able to
articulate the problem fully [33, 40]. Theory and evidence-based ap-
proaches, and stepped or phased approaches, also make use of qualita-
tive research with the target population, including observation [27, 34].
(ii) Assess the causes of the problems
Authors of a range of approaches recommend the use of the evidence

Methods
This will include the determinants of these causes,
influences on the problems, the size of problems
and who will benefit most and least from any
intervention [24, 27–29, 49]
base through literature or systematic reviews [24, 29, 34]. Alternatives are
drawing a logic model of the problem or model of causal pathways [27,
28] and creative approaches, such as group discussions, as a way of
developing questions for research evidence reviews [27].
(iii) Describe and understand the wider context of
the target population and the context in which the
intervention will be implemented
Consider context at different levels: macro, meso,
micro. Consider this context throughout the process
[7, 17, 26, 27, 33, 44–46, 53, 56]
This sub-action can be undertaken as part of the earlier sub-actions (i)
and (ii) but some approaches emphasise the importance of understand-
ing context and so it is described as a separate action here. Bartholomew
specifies the contexts of population, setting and community [27]. Again,
the use of qualitative research, particularly observation, is recommended.
The observation may be of service delivery where the intervention will
occur [41, 42] or of the target population in their real life context [33, 43–
45]. Conducting an asset assessment, that is, determining the strengths
of the community in which an intervention will take place is useful for a
health promotion intervention [27]. Some theories can help to under-
stand important aspects of context for implementation of the interven-
tion in the real world [46].
(iv) Identify evidence of effectiveness of interventions
for these problems, or for similar interventions once
decisions have been made about the intervention type,
so do not reinvent the wheel.
Understand why previous interventions failed so
can learn from this [7, 17, 31]
A range of approaches recommend systematic reviews of quantitative
evidence of effectiveness of interventions to identify what has worked,
and qualitative evidence to understand why interventions have worked
or not [7, 17, 31].
(v) Understand wider stakeholders’ perspectives of the
problems and issues [24, 28, 29, 39, 40, 59]
Authors of partnership and stepped/phased approaches recommend
working with wider stakeholders such as policy makers, community
leaders or service providers to clarify and understand the problems. This
can involve using research methods to obtain their views, meetings to
facilitate communication, or equal partnership with stakeholders using
activities to encourage active engagement in the context of partnership
approaches. Wider stakeholders may already be fully engaged within
partnership approaches or because they are members of groups
established in Action 2.
4. Make a decision about the specific problem or
problems that an intervention will address, and
the aims or goals for the intervention. This may
involve defining the behaviours to target [27, 56]
If a list of problems has been identified then decisions will need to be
made about which to prioritise and focus on [27, 56].
5. Identify possible ways of making changes to
address the problems.
This involves identifying what needs
to change, how to bring about this
change and what might need to change
at individual, interpersonal, organisational,
community or societal levels [7, 17, 26, 27,
29, 30, 34, 48, 55]
This action is addressed differently depending on the category of
approach, and aim and context, of the intervention. Interventions aiming
to address behaviour change in public health specify this action in detail,
recommending the creation of a ‘logic model for change’ showing
mechanisms of change and causal relationships between theory and
evidence-based change methods [27, 28]. The emphasis is on drawing
on existing theory or theories, and the research evidence base, to link de-
terminants of a problem and the objectives of the intervention [27]. Iden-
tifying a variety of theories rather than a single theory, including theories
relevant to later parts of the development process, e.g. implementation
theory, is recommended [27] at this action.
Other approaches offer less detail about how to do this but suggest
drawing a ‘conceptual map’ [26] or point out that it should be influenced
by the earlier qualitative research with stakeholders, including the target
population and those who will deliver intervention [30]. Qualitative
research can be used to ask why people would make any proposed
changes, how change should occur and barrier and facilitators to
change.
6. Specify who will change, how and when.
Selections may depend on consideration
of the likely impact of the change, how
easy it is to change, how influential
it is for the problem being addressed,
and how easy it is to measure [26, 27, 47]
Authors of theory and evidence-based approaches detail this action,
recommending using the combination of a theory or theoretical frame-
work with data from multiple sources such as interviews, focus groups,
questionnaires, direct observation, review of relevant documents, litera-
ture and involvement of stakeholders such as staff or patients [26]. There
may be a long list of issues to change and these will need to be priori-
tised at this action [26].
7. Consider real-world issues about cost and
delivery of any intervention at this early stage
to reduce the risk of implementation failure at
a later stage [7, 24, 27, 29, 33, 44–46, 48]
Understanding the context (see Action 3.iii above) can help here. Authors
recommend considering wider issues such as the cost of an intervention
or the stigma attached to using it [33] or how it fits with current
expectations of a professional group that would deliver it [24]. This is a

 the Person-Based Approach. There appeared to be a ten-
sion between offering detailed description and being too
prescriptive.
Utility or success
Some authors reported how their approach had been
used to develop interventions that were found to be ef-
fective. Such approaches included Experience Based
Co-design, Intervention Mapping, the Behaviour Change
Wheel and Person Based Approach.
Resource and expertise
Some authors explicitly addressed concerns about the
resource needed to develop an intervention. Some had
undertaken a part of one approach that required expert-
ise and constructed a new approach to reduce the cost
and knowledge required (MAP-IT). Some proposed that
their approach could be completed with limited re-
sources by reducing the length of time or resource spent
on each action (Intervention Mapping). One proposed
that the time and resources allocated should be influ-
enced by the importance of the problem being addressed
(Behaviour Change Wheel).
Relationship between approaches
Most approaches were proposed as independent ways of
developing interventions. Some were proposed as com-
plementary to existing approaches (Person-Based Ap-
proach), as explicit combinations of existing approaches
(PAR-BCP) or as ways of facilitating existing approaches
(MAP-IT). Some included the same actions but were in
different categories of the taxonomy because of the
weight placed on those actions in the stated rationale.
Discussion
Summary of findings
This is the most comprehensive review and synthesis of
diverse approaches to intervention development under-
taken to date. Eight categories of approach were identi-
fied and descriptive summaries of approaches within
each category offered. There is considerable overlap be-
tween categories in terms of the actions required, al-
though there are differences in the methods that authors
of different approaches use to address each action. Some
approaches are more comprehensive than others in
terms of addressing a wide range of actions, and some
offer more detailed accounts than others to help re-
searchers develop their own interventions. Intervention
development is a rapidly developing field and recent ad-
ditions have been proposed as complementary to exist-
ing approaches [17] or as enhancements [10].
How to use the taxonomy and synthesis of actions
This overview presents a broad range of approaches and
actions common to intervention development, to help
developers to select the approach or actions to suit their
context,
values
and
needs.
Intervention
developers
should consider the following questions when deciding
how to develop an intervention:
1. What is the intention of the intervention? e.g.
changing behaviour

Action
Methods
key action for implementation-based approaches. The authors of [48] rec-
ommend consideration of the barriers to reaching the target population,
how the intervention will function for different sub-groups, what percent-
age of organisations would be willing to adopt the intervention when
tested and ability to overcome any barriers [48]. This thinking and plan-
ning occurs early in the process and can involve formative research with
wider stakeholders. Authors of a range of other approaches propose that
implementation is considered at this early stage [24, 29], with the use of
theory to facilitate understanding of this [46] and the need to keep im-
plementation issues in mind throughout later processes [27]. Issues other
than effectiveness and cost-effectiveness that are related to implementa-
tion can be considered: affordability, practicability, acceptability, safety
and equity [26]. Authors of partnership approaches recommend bringing
staff and patients together to increase engagement and improve imple-
mentation [42]. Authors of stepped or phased approaches recommend
that developers have to understand the real world of practice so they
can develop not only effective interventions but interventions that practi-
tioners adopt [24].
8. Consider whether it is worthwhile continuing
with the process of developing an intervention [7, 48]
The cost of delivering an intervention may outweigh the benefits it can
potentially achieve. This issue is addressed in economic modelling
undertaken alongside RCTs but can also be considered at the planning
step by modelling processes and outcomes to determine if it is worth
developing an intervention [7]. Alternatively, if solutions to barriers to
future implementation in the real world (see Action 7) cannot be found
then it might not be worth developing an intervention [48].

3. Designing 9. Generate ideas about solutions, and
components and features of an
intervention [7, 17, 25–27, 30, 32, 33, 39,
40, 42]
Ways of generating ideas for the intervention differ based on the category of approach
to intervention development:
Work with stakeholders creatively
Partnership and target population-centred approaches recommend
bringing together a number of groups (e.g. patients, service providers
and product designers) to generate diverse ideas for solutions from
different perspectives. This is the central tenet of a co-design approach
where patients are equal partners in the whole process rather than simply
having their views sought [39–41]. Authors of partnership approaches
propose that listening to all voices is important, that processes to ensure
that this is undertaken in a meaningful way may be needed [40] and that
active engagement of diverse groups of stakeholders is ongoing throughout
the whole process [25, 42, 44, 45]. Encouraging all members of the development
team to interact directly with members the target population can guide the
development of solutions that are more relevant and acceptable to the target
population [30]. Methods to engage stakeholders may involve the use of
games/exercises/tasks to promote creativity [25, 30, 33, 40] and the iterative
use of prototypes (see step 4).
Target population involvement in intervention development at this design
domain is essential for authors of a range of approaches [7, 17, 25, 27, 30, 31, 42]
with a proposal to make this involvement short and creative for busy people [25].
Starting with divergent thinking and moving to convergent thinking is proposed
as a way of maximising the potential to identify the most powerful solutions [30].
Use theory
Theory and evidence-based approaches to intervention development recommend
mapping behavioural determinants to behaviour change techniques. This is a key
focus of the Behaviour Change Wheel, where lists of behaviour change techniques
are given so that developers can identify intervention functions such as education
or persuasion that can address the selected behaviours [26]. This is also a core action
in Intervention Mapping with the construction of matrices to facilitate this action [27].
Matrices have been constructed by a group of experts for a specific behaviour change
for a specific age group so that developers who are not experts in psychological theory
can undertake this action [32]. Authors of some theory-based approaches advocate creative
thinking as well as use of theory at this action [27]. A variety of theories rather than a single
theory may be considered because one theory cannot explain everything of relevance [27]
10. Re-visit decisions about where to
intervene
This can involve consideration of the
different levels at which to intervene, and
the wider system in which the
intervention will operate [7, 17, 24, 26–29,
34, 54–56]
Consideration of where to intervene starts earlier at Action 4 but at this point final
decisions need to be made. The authors of some approaches propose that this will require
several team meetings but they are not always clear about who should be involved in
these meetings. The ‘planning group’ [27] or ‘editorial group’ [31] may do this. Decisions
are made about:
• the scope of the intervention
• the target population (this may be narrower or broader than at the Conception and
Planning steps)
• levels at which the intervention is aimed: individual, community or population
• key features of the intervention (which may be components of other interventions)
• the components that will address the change required
• the amount of exposure needed to obtain effect
11. Make decisions about the content,
format and delivery of the intervention
[24, 26–28, 30, 31, 47, 48, 54, 55]
Ideas generated in Action 9 are prioritised for inclusion in the intervention. Decision-
making can be guided by the involvement of stakeholders, and theory and evidence in-
cluding theories on what motivates people to engage in processes as well as produce out-
comes, and use of taxonomies of modes of delivering interventions and evidence of
effectiveness of these modes. Spencer [40] recommends using small ‘action groups’ of
stakeholders who can use their relevant expertise to build the solution to the problem
identified. Feasibility, budget and time constraints can inform choices [27]. Authors of only
one approach recommend a formal consensus exercise for decisions in the specific case
where published research evidence is summarised within the intervention [31]. Issues iden-
tified for consideration here, based on a range of different approaches, include:
• what will be delivered (content)
• who will deliver it
• where it will be delivered
• how it will be delivered (format)
• how many times it will be delivered
• the point in any treatment or illness trajectory it will be delivered
• the order in which different parts of the intervention will be delivered
• the time period over which it will be delivered
• interactions between components

 2. What is the context of the intervention? e.g. public
health
3. What values inform the intervention development?
e.g. working in partnership with the target
population
4. What skills and experience does the team bring?
5. Which approaches have resulted in interventions
shown to be effective?
6. What resources are available for the intervention
development?
Some of these issues can be considered by reading
Table 2 where the different approaches are summarised
along with their contexts, strengths and limitations, and
Table 6 which shows which approaches address the dif-
ferent actions reported in this overview.
The synthesis of actions from all the approaches
shows the range of issues to consider. It may not be
possible to undertake all these actions, and indeed
not all of them may be necessary. By laying out the
range of actions in this overview, researchers can
consider the possibilities available to them and which
approaches address the actions they value for their
specific context (see Table 6).
Placing the findings in the context of other research
The approaches identified in other more narrowly fo-
cused reviews of intervention development are included
in this overview, for example MRC Guidance, Interven-
tion Mapping and multiphase optimization strategy
(MOST) [3, 4]. One of the earlier reviews identified
four tasks of intervention development which are in-
cluded in the actions identified in this overview: identi-
fying barriers, selecting intervention components, using
theory and engaging end-users [3]. A review of the suc-
cess of different types of interventions in diabetes in
childhood assessed the scientific rigour of the develop-
ment processes of each type of intervention [36]. The
checklist for scientific rigour was based on the content
of one approach to intervention development, and
reporting guidelines. Items in this checklist appear in
the actions in this overview, e.g. existence of a manual
to guide procedures, and explicit statement of theoret-
ical basis of the intervention. A recent paper was pub-
lished on enriching the development phase of the MRC
Framework by including steps from seven other ap-
proaches [10]. Again, the steps identified are included
in this overview: problem identification, systematic
identification of evidence, identification or development

• the resources available for delivery
• how implementers will be trained
• the potential for harm
• the meaning of fidelity
12. Design an implementation plan,
thinking about who will adopt the
intervention and maintain it [27, 48]
Consideration is given to implementation at the Planning domain (Action 7 earlier) but this
action relates to establishing a formal implementation plan once the content, format and
delivery of the intervention is known. Some authors recommend that this plan is based on
the formative research undertaken earlier to understand barriers to implementation [48].
Others recommend basing this plan on a combination of theory and evidence from
implementation science, and participation of stakeholders, to promote the use of the
intervention in the real world [27]
4. Creating
13. Make prototypes or mock-ups of the
intervention, where relevant [17, 25, 27,
30, 31, 33, 39, 40, 53, 54, 56, 59]
This action starts in the Design domain, and indeed is seen as an essential action in the
Design domain by authors of some approaches. It is identified as a separate domain here
because it is identified as such a key part of the process of intervention development by
some authors. Testing prototypes can help developers to make decisions about the
content, format and delivery of the intervention. It also continues into the Refining domain
where refinements are made to prototypes as feasibility and acceptability is assessed.
Authors of approaches to digital interventions recommend creating an early prototype of
any physical intervention to get feedback from the target population using think aloud,
usability testing, interviews or focus groups [17, 30, 57]. The prototype can be rough, e.g.
paper copies of what a digital application could look like, and can be changed rapidly after
feedback from stakeholders. These prototypes can generate further ideas for different
prototypes as well as refine a current prototype. In some user-centred and digital ap-
proaches, authors recommend producing multiple rough and cheap prototypes at first and
then reducing these down to a single prototype after stakeholder feedback [30, 33, 59].
They do this rather than focus on a single prototype too soon and call them ‘build to think’
prototypes [59].
If commercial designers are involved in creating prototypes, then differences in language
and values between academia and commercial designers will need to be discussed, a
contract established and decisions defined [53]

Methods
5. Refining
14. Test on small samples for feasibility and
acceptability and make changes to the intervention
if possible [17, 24, 27, 28, 30, 31, 34, 53, 54, 57]
Authors of a range of approaches recommend iterative testing
and formative evaluation for this action. Some recommend
qualitative research with those receiving and delivering the
intervention. For example, think aloud interviews with the target
population as they use the intervention, videos of people using
the intervention [17, 30, 31, 57] or asking users to keep a diary of
issues arising when using the intervention to prompt their
memory during interviews. For some approaches the prototype
discussed in the Creating domain is used to obtain specific
views rather than general views on the intervention [31, 44, 45]
and the use of observation moves beyond people’s views. The
process can start small, for example with only the development
team commenting on the first prototype and then widening the
sample to members of the target population [31]. Quantitative
as well as qualitative research is recommended, for example pre-
test post-test comparison looking for changes in some inter-
mediate outcomes for a small number of the target population
using the intervention [34]. The potential for unintended conse-
quences can also be considered [48].
15. Test on a more diverse population, moving away
from the single setting where early development of the
intervention took place and seeking a more diverse sample.
This can involve asking questions such as ‘is it working as
intended?’, ‘is it achieving short term goals?’,
‘is it having serious adverse effects’? [17, 24, 25, 28, 31, 34, 54, 57]
The iterative approach used in Action 14 continues here by
making changes to the intervention and continuing to use
mixed methods to check if changes are working as planned on
more diverse samples. Authors of a range of approaches
recommend using pre-test post-test design, n-of-1 trials and ob-
servation or video to consider acceptability and early feasibility.
They also recommend using real members of the target popula-
tion in a real-life environment to identify interactions and rela-
tionships between different service providers and patients to
iteratively modify the intervention. Groups of wider stakeholders
can review the intervention as it iterates [24, 54].
16. Optimise the intervention for efficiency prior to full RCT
[34, 49–52]
Some approaches consider Actions 14 and 15 to be part of the
process of optimisation of the intervention through the use of
mixed methods. Case series can be used to consider issues such
as dose, patterns of use over time, and safety [34]. Efficiency-
based approaches and some stepped/phase approaches take a
more quantitative approach: fractional factorial designs can be
used to identify active components, interactions between com-
ponents of an intervention, the doses that lead to best out-
comes and tailoring to sub-groups [34, 50]. A review of
optimisation of interventions has been published [4].
6. Documenting 17. Document the intervention, describing the intervention so
others can use it and offer instructions on how to train
practitioners delivering the intervention and on how to
implement the intervention [7, 17, 24, 26, 29, 34, 48, 57]
This document is sometimes called a manual. The manual is
written by the developers. Authors of some approaches
recommend that it undergoes external review by stakeholders,
including the target population and those delivering the
intervention, to make sure it is feasible for use in the real world
[24, 26, 29].
7. Planning for
future
evaluation
18. Develop the objectives of the outcome and process
evaluations.
This includes determining how outcomes and mediators of
change can be measured, developing measures, specifying
evaluation design, planning recruitment and considering
feasibility of a full RCT [24, 27, 29, 31, 40, 47, 48]
Authors of some approaches recommend planning for a
randomised study or experimental design with controls for
measuring effectiveness [29], whereas others recognise that
there may not always be the resources to evaluate with a RCT so
the intervention may be implemented in practice and
monitored [31].
Authors of some approaches recommend involving stakeholders
such as funders, implementers and the target population in this
action [27], particularly getting agreement with key stakeholders
about how to define and measure success [48]. Partnership
approaches recommend that this is undertaken with
stakeholders [40].

 of theory, determination of needs, examination of
current practice or context and modelling process and
expected outcomes.
Strengths and limitations
This is the first time such a broad and detailed re-
view of approaches to intervention development has
been undertaken. The overview is timely given the
current interest in undertaking good intervention de-
velopment. There were five limitations. First, there
was a subjective aspect to the selection of approaches
that is common to all qualitatively oriented reviews.
Team discussion was used to address subjectivity and
a description has been given of how decisions were
made by authors of this overview. It is likely that the
majority—but
not
all—of
the
included
approaches
would appear in a similar overview undertaken by a
different team. Second, as planned, this is not an ex-
haustive list of approaches and readers will be able to
name other approaches. Third, the taxonomy was
based on the rationale provided by authors of ap-
proaches. This rationale was not always explicit, and
was dependent on the report given in the websites,
books or articles included; authors of approaches may
not necessarily agree with the interpretation of their
rationale. Fourth, this is a rapidly developing field
and new approaches were published after the end of
formal data extraction and were not included [10,
37]. Finally, a comparison of the success of each ap-
proach has not been undertaken (for example, the
number of times effective interventions have been de-
veloped using each approach), although authors’ own
reports of success have been included. Further re-
search could synthesise evidence of effectiveness of
different categories of approach, specific approaches
or actions within approaches.
Research gaps
Another important part of the picture is to understand
how interventions are actually developed in practice. A re-
view of primary research reporting this activity is being
undertaken as part of the wider INDEX study. The
intention is to compare the approaches reported here with
practice. It is already apparent that some approaches are
used in primary studies but documentation describing the
approach in the context of intervention development
could not be found for inclusion in this overview, in par-
ticular community-based participatory research. The use
of patient and public involvement within intervention de-
velopment is also absent from the approaches described
here. This may be more prominent in the review of pri-
mary research studies in the INDEX study noted above.
Conclusions
This overview of approaches to intervention develop-
ment can help researchers to understand the variety of
Table 6 Actions undertaken in intervention development within each approach (black dot in a cell indicates that an action labelled
1–18 described in Tables 3, 4 and 5 is recommended by an approach)

 approaches available and the range of possible actions
involved in intervention development, before undertak-
ing any feasibility or piloting phase. Findings from this
overview will contribute to future guidance on interven-
tion development.
