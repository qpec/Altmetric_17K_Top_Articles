Abstract
Background: Most women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) will receive breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and radiation
(RT). RT can be omitted for women at low risk of local recurrence (LR). The Oncotype DX DCIS score (DS) predicts LR risk after
BCS alone. This study assesses the impact of RT and DS on LR risk.
Methods: Population-based cohort analysis of individuals with DCIS treated by BCS 6 RT from 1994–2003. Treatment and out-
comes were determined by linkage and chart review. We used a propensity score–adjusted multivariable model to examine
associations between DS and LR and evaluate the impact of RT. All statistical tests were two-sided.
Results: The cohort includes 571 individuals treated by BCS alone, 689 cases treated with BCS þ RT. Median follow-up was 9.4
years. On multivariable analysis, factors associated with LR include RT, age at diagnosis, tumor size, and multifocality.
Adjusting for these factors, the DS risk group was statistically significantly associated with LR risk (hazard ratio high/interme-
diate ¼ 1.75, 95% confidence interval ¼ 1.28 to 2.41, P < .001). Women with a low-risk DS treated by BCS alone had an LR risk
of 10.6% at 10 years and a small benefit from RT, while those with a high DS had a higher risk of LR (25.4%) after BCS alone
and greater benefit from RT. A subgroup of patients with favorable clinicopathological features had a high-risk DS; these pa-
tients had a higher than expected risk of LR after BCS alone and a greater benefit with RT.
Conclusions: The DS molecular assay improves risk stratification and estimates of RT benefit in individuals with DCIS treated
with breast-conserving therapy.

 The management of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) continues
to be a challenge. DCIS is predominantly diagnosed in healthy
women and is associated with a low risk of mortality (1–3). On
the other hand, it is well documented that some women with
DCIS will develop ipsilateral invasive breast cancer, which is as-
sociated with a seven- to 17-fold increased risk of dying of
breast cancer (4,5). Our inability to identify patients at low risk
of recurrence results in recommendations that all women with
DCIS undergo treatment.
Most women will be treated with breast-conserving surgery
(BCS), usually followed by whole breast radiation (RT), because of
its proven efficacy to reduce local recurrence (LR) risk (2). There is
agreement that RT can be omitted for women at low risk of
recurrenc; however, clinical and pathologic features have not re-
liably identified patients at low risk of LR following BCS alone,
leading to variability in treatment and outcomes of women with
DCIS (6,7). The long-term results of two prospective cohort stud-
ies of selected women with low-risk features of DCIS treated by
BCS alone without RT were recently reported. The ECOG E5194
study included cases with clear margins (>3 mm), with either
low- or intermediate-grade DCIS measuring less than 2.5 cm
(cohort 1) or small (�1 cm) high-grade lesions (cohort 2). The cor-
responding 12-year local recurrence risks were 14.4% for cohort 1
and 24.6% for cohort 2 (6). A second prospective cohort study of
similar patients (margins � 1 cm) reported a 10-year risk of LR of
15.6% (7). A population-based analysis including 1867 women
with DCIS treated by BCS alone found that the 10-year risk of LR
was 19.2% (8). These studies demonstrate that clinicopathologi-
cal features do not reliably identify the individuals with DCIS at
low risk of LR after BCS alone, culminating in unnecessary treat-
ment of those at low risk of recurrence and undertreatment of
patients with higher-risk disease in whom additional efficacious
treatment such as RT was not administered. Molecular bio-
markers are needed to improve recurrence risk assessment and
treatment decision-making in DCIS.
The Oncotype DCIS score (DS) is a multigene expression as-
say for DCIS patients that generates individualized estimates of
10-year risk of LR (DCIS or invasive) following treatment by BCS
alone (9). The DS includes 12 of the 21 genes of the recurrence
score assay for invasive carcinoma (10). The DCIS score was re-
cently shown to predict an individual’s risk of LR in the E5194
cohort study and was further validated in a population cohort
treated by BCS alone (9,11). However, the impact of the assay in
individuals treated by BCS þ RT is unknown. In the current
study, we determine if the DCIS score is an independent predic-
tor of local recurrence in a population of individuals with DCIS
treated with BCS þ RT and assess the impact of RT according to
the DCIS score, adjusting for statistically significant clinicopath-
ological covariates.
Methods
Ontario DCIS Cohort
The methods used to establish the Ontario population-based
DCIS cohort have been previously described (8). Cases treated by
mastectomy, those diagnosed with invasive breast cancer or
who died within six months of DCIS, and those with bilateral
DCIS were excluded. The population includes 3320 cases with
pure DCIS treated by BCS, 1658 treated by BCS alone and 1662 by
BCS þ RT. We obtained tissue blocks in 1751 cases (n ¼ 828, BCS
alone; n ¼ 923, BCS þ RT). One hundred eighty-six cases were
excluded from analysis because of the presence of invasive
carcinoma (n ¼ 9), no tumor present (n ¼ 20), insufficient RNA
(n ¼ 108), poor quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)
sample quality (n ¼ 49), or absence of clear margins (n ¼ 304).
The cohort includes 571 individuals treated by BCS and 689 indi-
viduals treated by BCS þ RT. This study was approved by the in-
stitutional review board at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre,
Toronto, Canada.
Pathology
Pathology review was performed on all original hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E) slides from each BCS specimen or recuts as de-
scribed (11,12). Nuclear grade, comedo necrosis, multifocality,
tumor size (DCIS greatest dimension, mm), and margin status
were predefined and assessed (13). Multifocal lesions were de-
fined as having more than one distinct focus of DCIS, with at
least 5.0 mm of intervening benign tissue confined to a single
quadrant of the breast (14). Tumor size and margin width could
not be assessed in cases without complete sets of slides or
where the gross description was incomplete.
Treatment
Methods used to obtain data on treatment and outcomes were
previously described (8). Deterministic linkage was performed
with the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) data-
base of discharge summaries, the Ontario Health Insurance
Plan (OHIP) database of physician billings, the Registered
Persons Database (RPDB), and the Ontario Cancer Registry (OCR)
database. Breast surgical procedures and administration of RT
were validated by chart review. The date of diagnosis is the date
of the initial breast surgery associated with the DCIS diagnosis.
All breast surgical procedures performed on the same breast
within six months of DCIS diagnosis were considered part of ini-
tial treatment. Tamoxifen usage was not available for the
cohort.
Outcomes
To identify subsequent breast events, we first identified all
breast surgical procedures performed six months or more after
diagnosis of the index DCIS lesion. We linked with the OCR and
CIHI databases and reviewed available pathology reports to de-
termine recurrence laterality and histology of the subsequent
breast event. Outcomes were determined from the date of DCIS
diagnosis. LR is defined as invasive breast cancer or DCIS in the
ipsilateral breast six months or more after DCIS diagnosis.
Invasive LR is defined as the development of an invasive breast
cancer in the ipsilateral breast whether it was a first or subse-
quent recurrence. Contralateral breast cancer is defined by the
presence of DCIS or invasive breast cancer in the opposite
breast. The date of death was determined from the RPDB. The
last date of follow-up is March 31, 2010. Because LR risks after
BCS for DCIS have decreased over time, we evaluated outcomes
for the whole study period and in those treated in the most con-
temporary years, 2000–2003.
Gene Assay
The DS was previously described (10,15). Cases with DCIS le-
sions smaller than 2 mm were excluded (9,11). RNA was ex-
tracted from 30 mm sections if DCIS measured 5.5 mm or larger,

 or from 60 mm sections if DCIS measured smaller than 5.5 mm.
The DS is scaled as a continuous variable from 0 to 100 or in
three risk categories as used in prior studies: 1) low risk
(DS < 39), 2) intermediate risk (DS ¼ 39 – 54), and 3) high risk
(DS � 55) (8,11).
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive analyses were conducted by examining the distribu-
tions of patient characteristics of women treated by BCS alone
or BCS þ RT. Categorical characteristics were summarized using
frequencies and percentages, and chi-square tests were used to
investigate associations. The first objective was to examine the
association between DS and hazard of LR among patients
treated with BCS þ RT with clear margins. We implemented two
multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models, one
in which DS was treated as a continuous measure and another
in which it was treated as a three-level categorical variable
(low-, intermediate-, high-risk groups). These models were ad-
justed for tumor size (>1 cm or �1 cm) and multifocality (yes/
no). For cases where tumor size was missing, size was imputed
using a linear regression model (tumor size ¼ 4.17*min (#blocks
involved,10)-0.215*min (#blocks involved,10)þ0.35*largest focus;
correlation between imputed values and observed values ¼
0.84). The assumption of proportionality was verified using a
Kolmogorov-type supremum test.
The subsequent aim was to examine the association be-
tween DS and hazard of LR among the entire cohort of women
with clear margins. To account for systematic differences be-
tween women treated with BCS alone vs BCS þ RT (and to ob-
tain an unbiased estimate of the effect of the DCIS score on the
risk of LR), we used a propensity score adjustment approach
(16). A propensity score was calculated for each patient, where
the score is the linear component of the logistic regression
model and measures each woman’s probability of receiving RT,
conditional on measured covariates: tumor size, margins, sur-
gery year, age (linear, quadratic, and cubic terms), subtype, mul-
tifocality, nuclear grade, comedo necrosis, estrogen receptor
status, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status.
Conditional on the propensity score, the distribution of ob-
served baseline covariates will be similar between treatment
groups (16). A multivariable Cox regression model was imple-
mented to identify factors associated with LR. We used a for-
ward selection approach (adjusted for propensity score) and
included the following covariates: age at diagnosis (< 50, �50
years), tumor size (>1 cm, �1cm), nuclear grade (low/intermedi-
ate, high), comedo necrosis (yes/no), subtype (solid, cribriform,
other), RT (yes/no), surgery year, and the DCIS score. The DS
was evaluated separately as a continuous variable (per 50 units)
and as a categorical risk group (low, intermediate, high).
Multivariable Cox models, adjusted for propensity score,
were used to estimate the absolute risk of LR at 10 years with
differences between curves compared using log-rank test. To
compute the 10-year estimates for a subgroup of interest with a
fixed set of covariates, a prediction was made for each of 202
possible combinations of treatment and the integer DS, while
holding the propensity score constant at the average value for
that subgroup. In the absence of a statistically significant inter-
action, the model assumes all effects are constant between
treatment groups.
A P value of less than .05 was considered to be statistically
significant. All statistical tests were two-sided.
Results
Population-Based Cohort
The cohort includes 571 individuals treated by BCS and 689
individuals treated by BCS þ RT. Median follow-up was 9.4 years
(9.6 years for individuals treated by BCS alone and 9.2 years for
those treated with BCS þ RT).
Among cases treated by BCS alone, about 62.2% (n ¼ 355) had
a low-risk DS, 16.6% (n ¼ 95) had an intermediate-risk score, and
21.2% (n ¼ 121) had a high-risk DS. There were 100 local recur-
rences (57 invasive, 44 DCIS [one invasive developed after
DCIS]). The 10-year cumulative risk of LR for women treated by
BCS alone was 19.2%. Individuals in the cohort who received RT
had more adverse features than those treated by BCS alone
(Table 1). Forty-eight point one percent of patients treated by
BCS þ RT (n ¼ 332) had a low-risk DS, 22.5% (n ¼ 155) had an in-
termediate-risk score, and 29.3% (n ¼ 202) had a high-risk score.
There were 86 local recurrences among those treated with RT
(55 invasive, 32 DCIS). The 10-year cumulative risk of LR for
women treated by BCS þ RT was 12.7% (95% CI ¼ 10.2% to 15.8%).
Predictors of Local Recurrence After BCS Alone or BCS 1
RT in Patients With Clear Margins
We previously reported that factors associated with LR in
women treated by BCS alone include the DS (hazard ratio [HR] ¼
1.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] ¼ 1.08 to 2.62), multifocality
(HR ¼ 1.97, 95% CI ¼ 1.27 to 3.02), tumor size larger than 1 cm
(HR ¼ 2.07, 95% CI ¼ 1.15 to 3.83), age at diagnosis (HR ¼ 1.75, 95%
CI ¼ 1.07 to 2.76), and subtype (HR ¼ 1.63 solid vs cribriform, 95%
CI ¼ 0.97 to 2.88) (11). Among patients treated with BCS þ RT

(Table 2). Adjusting for these covariates, the DS was statistically
significantly associated with the development of LR both when
evaluated as a continuous variable (HR per 50 units ¼ 3.10, 95%
CI ¼ 1.87 to 5.16, P < .001) or categorical DS risk group. The haz-
ards ratio for individuals with a high-risk score was 2.53 (95%
CI ¼ 1.48 to 4.35, P < .001) and for those with an intermediate-
risk score was 1.62 (95% CI ¼ 0.88 to 2.92) compared with those
with a low-risk score (P ¼ .11) (Table 2). The 10-year risks of LR
were 20.5% (95% CI ¼ 15.1% to 27.5%) for those with a high-risk
score, 13.6% (95% CI ¼ 8.6% to 21.2%) for those with an interme-
diate-risk score, and 7.5% (95% CI ¼ 4.9% to 11.2%) for those
with a low-risk score (P < .001) (Figure 1).
Whole Cohort Analysis
We combined the two treatment groups and used a propensity
score–adjusted multivariable model to identify pertinent factors
associated with the development of LR among individuals
treated by BCS with or without RT. We found age at diagnosis
younger than 50 years (HR ¼ 1.54, 95% CI ¼ 1.10 to 2.14, P ¼ .01),
tumor size larger than 1 cm (HR ¼ 1.98, 95% CI ¼ 1.35 to 2.99, P ¼
.001), the presence of multifocality (HR ¼ 1.88, 95% CI ¼ 1.37 to
2.55, P < .001), solid subtype (HR ¼ 1.43, 95% CI ¼ 0.96 to 2.18, P ¼
.09), and the administration of RT (HR ¼ 0.56, 95% CI ¼ 0.42 to
0.76, P < .001) were associated with LR (Table 3). Adjusting for
these covariates and year of diagnosis, the DS remained a statis-
tically significant predictor of LR (HR ¼ 1.97 per 50 units, 95%
CI ¼ 1.37 to 2.84, P < .001). The hazard ratio for the high-risk DS
group (HR ¼ 1.77, 95% CI ¼ 1.24 to 2.35) and the intermediate-risk
group (HR ¼ 1.73, 95% CI ¼ 1.17 to 2.52) were statistically (HR for
high/intermediate groups combined ¼ 1.75, 95% CI ¼ 1.28 to 2.41)
significantly higher compared with the low-risk DS group.

 There was no statistically significant interaction between the
DS and RT (data not shown, P ¼ .44). Nuclear grade and the pres-
ence of comedo necrosis were not associated with LR (Table 3).
Figure 2 illustrates the predicted risks of local recurrence by
DS following treatment by BCS alone or BCS þ RT, adjusted for
propensity score and year of diagnosis. For individuals with a
low-risk DS, the 10-year risk of LR after BCS alone was 16.0% (95%
CI¼ 12.2% to 20.9%) and 9.4% (95% CI¼ 7.0% to 12.5%) after BCS þ
RT (absolute reduction with RT ¼ 6.6%, 95% CI¼ 5.2% to 8.4%)
(Figure 2A). The 10-year risks of invasive LR were 9.7% (95% CI¼
6.7% to 13.9%) after BCS alone and 6.8% (95% CI¼ 4.7% to 9.7%)
after BCS þ RT (absolute reduction with RT ¼ 2.9%, 95% CI¼ 2.0%
to 4.2%, data not shown). For cases with a low-risk DCIS score
treated in the most contemporary years of the study period (years
2000–2003), the risks of LR were lower (Figure 2B). The 10-year
risks of LR after BCS alone was 10.6% (95% CI¼ 5.6% to 17.0%)
and 5.0% (95% CI¼ 2.9% to 8.6%) for those treated with BCS þ RT
(absolute reduction with RT ¼ 5.6%, 95% CI¼ 2.7% to 8.4%).
Individuals with a high-risk DS experienced higher risks of LR
and invasive LR and had a greater absolute benefit with RT com-
pared with those with a low-risk score. Adjusting for propensity
score and year of diagnosis, the 10-year risk of LR was 32.7% (95%
CI¼ 25.9% to 40.6%) after BCS alone and 20.0% (95% CI¼ 15.9% to
24.9%) after BCS þ RT (absolute reduction with RT ¼ 12.7%, 95%
CI¼ 10.0% to 15.7%) (Figure 2). The corresponding risks of invasive
LR were 17.0% (95% CI¼ 11.9% to 23.8%) and 11.9% (95% CI ¼ 8.7%
to 16.2%; absolute reduction with RT ¼ 5.1%, 95% CI ¼ 3.2% to
7.6%, data not shown). Among cases diagnosed in years 2000–2003

were 25.4% (95% CI¼ 16.3% to 38.3%) after BCS alone and 12.6%

Impact of Multigene Assay in Cases With Low-risk
Clinicopathological Features of DCIS
The eligibility criteria used in studies of “low-risk DCIS” include
individuals with low– or intermediate–nuclear grade DCIS, wide
clear margins, and tumor size smaller than 2.5 cm (6,7,17). Most
participants were age 50 years or older at diagnosis. We as-
sessed the predicted risks of LR in cases from the population co-
hort with similar clinicopathological features and evaluated the
impact of the DCIS score on LR risks. Within the whole popula-
tion cohort meeting these criteria (n ¼ 286), three-quarters
(74.1%) had a low-risk DS and for these women the 10-year risk
of LR after BCS alone was 13.9%. However, 9.8% of women with
these favorable clinico-pathological features had a high-risk DS,
and for these cases the 10-year risk of LR following BCS alone
was 28.9%. Restricting our analysis to cases treated after the
year 2000, 80.0% had a low-risk DS, and for these women the 10-
year risk of LR after BCS alone was 10.1%. Similarly, 8.5% of
cases had a high-risk DS, and for these individuals the 10-year
risk of LR after BCS alone was 19.6%. Overall, the absolute reduc-
tion in 10 year LR risk with RT for women with favorable clinico-
pathological features and a low risk DS was 10.1% (95% CI ¼ 6.9%
to 14.8%) vs. 6.0% (95% CI ¼ 4.1% to 8.9%) and 19.6% (95%
CI ¼ 12.8% to 29.5%) vs. 11.9% (95% CI ¼ 7.8% to 18.0%) for those
with a high risk DCIS score (Figure 3).
Discussion
The inability to reliably identify lesions at low risk of recurrence
after surgical excision has hampered attempts to deescalate
therapy for certain women with DCIS while ensuring adherence
to recommended RT for those at higher risk. We found that the
DS molecular assay predicts the risk of LR following treatment
by breast-conserving surgery and improves risk stratification
and estimates of RT benefit in conjunction with and beyond
clinico-pathological
characteristics.
We
used
a
propensity
score–weighted analysis to adjust for imbalances in known ad-
verse risk factors between treatment groups. The molecular as-
say is independently associated with LR risk. Individuals with a
high-risk (�55) or an intermediate-risk score (39–54) had a
nearly twofold increased risk of LR compared with those with a
low-risk score. Other pertinent factors associated with LR include
tumor size larger than 1 cm, the presence of multifocality, solid
subtype, and the administration of RT. Nuclear grade and the
presence of comedo necrosis were not associated with LR. The
lack of statistical significance of nuclear grade was also reported
in the recent E5194 analysis (6). Further research is needed to de-
termine whether the integrated assessment of grade, which in-
cluded nuclear grade, comedo necrosis, and histologic subtype, is
more informative as a predictor of LR than nuclear grade.
The RTOG 9804 trial (17), E5194 trial (6), and Boston studies
(7) included patients with favorable clinico-pathological fea-
tures of DCIS deemed to be associated with a low risk of LR after
BCS alone (age � 50 years, tumor size � 2.5 cm, nuclear grade 1
or 2, and margins � 3 mm). We identified cases in the popula-
tion cohort treated in 2000–2003 with similar features (age � 50
years, tumor size � 2.5 cm, nuclear grade 1 or 2) but with clear
margins (we did not have data on margin width) treated by BCS
alone. Most cases with these low-risk clinico-pathological fea-
tures had a low-risk DS, and for these cases treatment by BCS
alone was associated with the expected low risk of LR (10.1% at
10 years). However, the molecular assay identified a subset of
patients (11%) with these same features treated during the
same time period who had a high-risk score, and for these
patients
treatment
by
BCS
alone
was
associated
with
a
significantly higher risk of LR (19.6% at 10 years). This suggests

Our study was not without limitations. Patients were not
randomized and were selected for treatment based on clinico-
pathologic features and patient preference. During the time in-
terval of this study, many pathology reports lacked tumor size
and resection margin width information (18,19). Therefore, mar-
gin width and tumor size data were incomplete. In addition,
data on clinical presentation or family history of breast cancer
that may predict for LR were not available. Complete data on ta-
moxifen usage were not available; however, tamoxifen utiliza-
tion during the time period of this study was infrequently used.
There was no statistically significant interaction between the
DS and RT, suggesting that the proportional reduction in the
risk of LR related to RT may be similar for women with a low-
risk or high-risk DCIS score. However, women with a low-risk
score derive a small absolute benefit from RT. Individuals with
a high-risk score experienced significantly higher risks of LR af-
ter treatment by BCS alone (10-year risk of LR ¼ 32.7%) and de-
rived a greater benefit from RT (8% absolute reduction in LR).
Among cases diagnosed in years 2000–2003 with a high-risk DS,
the 10-year risks of local recurrence were 25.4% after BCS alone
and 12.6% after BCS þ RT. Patients with a high-risk score and
other adverse features had a higher risk of LR; however, the
number of cases in the subset is small. Additional data are
needed to evaluate the outcomes and optimize the manage-
ment of women with high-risk DCIS.
The DS molecular assay can improve treatment recommen-
dations in DCIS. It provides individualized estimates of LR risk
after BCS alone, improved identification of patients at low risk
of recurrence in whom the absolute benefit of RT is small, and
those at higher risk who might benefit from additional treat-
ment. Women age 50 years or older at diagnosis with tumor
size of 2.5 cm or smaller and nuclear grade 1 or 2 with clear mar-
gins comprise the majority of women with DCIS today and rep-
resent the subgroup with which clinicians are most concerned
about overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Most women with
these features had a low-risk DS, and for these women the 10-
year risk of LR after BCS alone was low and the absolute benefit
from RT was very small. On the other hand, 10% of women with
these same favorable clinico-pathological features had a high-
risk molecular score, and these women had a higher risk of LR
after BCS alone and a greater benefit from RT. Most cases in this
population cohort did not receive tamoxifen (90%), which may
lead to further lowering of the risks of recurrence, although ad-
herence is inconsistent (20). Further research is needed to inte-
grate the impact of other relevant risk factors and to optimize
the treatment of women with high-risk DCIS by evaluating the
impact of higher doses of radiation, systemic therapies, and
mastectomy.
