AbsTrACT
background studies have suggested that women’s 
reproductive factors are associated with the risk 
of cardiovascular disease (cVD); however, findings 
are mixed. We assessed the relationship between 
reproductive factors and incident cVD in the UK Biobank.
Methods Between 2006 and 2010, the UK Biobank 
recruited over 500 000 participants aged 40–69 years 
across the UK. During 7 years of follow-up, 9054 incident 
cases of cVD (34% women), 5782 cases of coronary 
heart disease (chD) (28% women), and 3489 cases of 
stroke (43% women) were recorded among 267 440 
women and 215 088 men without a history of cVD at 
baseline. cox regression models yielded adjusted hazard 
ratios (hrs) for cVD, chD and stroke associated with 
reproductive factors.
results adjusted hrs (95% ci) for cVD were 1.10 
(1.01 to 1.30) for early menarche (<12 years), 0.97 
(0.96 to 0.98) for each year increase in age at first birth, 
1.04 (1.00 to 1.09) for each miscarriage, 1.14 (1.02 
to 1.28) for each stillbirth, and 1.33 (1.19 to 1.49) for 
early menopause (<47 years). hysterectomy without 
oophorectomy or with previous oophorectomy had 
adjusted hrs of 1.16 (1.06 to 1.28) and 2.30 (1.20 to 
4.43) for cVD. each additional child was associated with 
a hr for cVD of 1.03 (1.00 to 1.06) in women and 1.03 
(1.02 to 1.05) in men.
Conclusions early menarche, early menopause, earlier 
age at first birth, and a history of miscarriage, stillbirth or 
hysterectomy were each independently associated with a 
higher risk of cVD in later life. the relationship between 
the number of children and incident cVD was similar for 
men and women.
InTroduCTIon
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading 
cause of death and disability worldwide in both 
sexes.1 Most of the burden of CVD can be explained 
by a set of traditional risk factors that affect both 
men and women, including elevated blood pres-
sure, smoking, overweight and obesity, diabetes 
mellitus, and elevated cholesterol. In women, there 
is increasing evidence to suggest that several repro-
ductive factors may be associated with the risk of 
CVD in later life.2–4 However, the findings are 
mixed and inconsistent, which, in addition to meth-
odological limitations of previous studies, may be 
attributed to differences in women's reproductive 
patterns between populations and over time.
Most, but not all, studies have reported that an 
early menarche and an early menopause are associ-
ated with an increased risk of CVD in later life.2 3 5–7 
A history of miscarriage or recurrent miscarriage has 
been linked to an increased risk of coronary heart 
disease (CHD), with weaker evidence for stroke.8 
Few studies have examined the association between 
stillbirth and the risk of CVD, with inconsistent 
findings.2 9–11 Moreover, while several studies have 
found that parity (number of children) is associ-
ated with the risk of maternal CVD, recent reports 
found that the association between the number of 
children and the risk of CVD was similar between 
men and women, suggesting that the association 
between high parity and CVD in later life may be 
largely explained by social, cultural, psychological 
and behavioural factors associated with parenthood 
and childrearing.12–14 Studies have shown that 
hysterectomy might be associated with an increased 
risk for CVD, but the evidence is inconclusive 
and may differ between women with and without 
oophorectomy.15–17
In a previous cross-sectional analysis in the UK 
Biobank, we demonstrated that several reproduc-
tive factors were associated with levels of general 
and central body adiposity.18 In the present study, 
we use prospective data from 482 
000 women and 
men in the UK Biobank to assess the relationship 
between reproductive factors and the risk of inci-
dent CVD in later life.
MeThods
study population
The UK Biobank is a large prospective, popula-
tion-based cohort study.19 Between 2006 and 2010, 
over 500 
000 women and men (5.5% response rate) 
aged 40–69 years at baseline attended one of the 22 
centres across the UK. Participants provided elec-
tronic informed consent and completed question-
naires on their lifestyle, environment and medical 
history, had physical and functional measures 
performed, and had samples of blood, urine and 
saliva collected. We included 267 
440 women and 
215 
088 men without a history of CVD at baseline.
reproductive factors
Self-reported reproductive factors included in this 
analysis were age at menarche, number of live births 
(henceforth, children), age at first birth, history 
and number of miscarriage(s) and stillbirth(s), 
history of, and age at hysterectomy and oophorec-
tomy, menopausal status and, if menopausal, age 
at natural menopause. Men were asked how many 
children they had fathered. Early menarche was 
defined as age at first menstrual period before the 
age of 12 years. Early menopause was defined as

study endpoints
The main study endpoints were the incidence of fatal or non-fatal 
myocardial infarction (MI) (henceforth CHD) or stroke, as 
defined by the UK Biobank. Outcome adjudication involved 
linkage with hospital admissions data in England, Scotland and 
Wales and national death register data to identify the date of 
the first known CHD or stroke after the date of baseline assess-
ment. Incident CHD was defined by codes I21, I22, I23, I24.1 
or I25.2 in the 10th edition of the International Classification 
of Diseases (ICD-10). Incident stroke was defined by ICD-10 
codes I60, I61, I63, or I64. Follow-up started at inclusion in the 
UK Biobank study and ended on 1 March 2016, or on the first 
fatal or non-fatal CHD or stroke, for all participants.CVD was 
defined as the first occurrence of either CHD or stroke. 
statistical analyses
Baseline characteristics are presented as means (SD) for contin-
uous variables and as percentages for categorical variables. Cox 
proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard 
ratios and 95%  confidence intervals (HR, 95% CI) for the 
study endpoints associated with reproductive factors. The 
Cox proportional hazards assumption was checked using log 
cumulative hazard plots and appeared to be reasonable. Penal-
ised smoothing splines were used to graphically examine the 
shape of associations between reproductive factors and the 
study endpoints. Linear trends were reported where the asso-
ciations were approximately log-linear. Categorical analyses 
were conducted for all reproductive factors. For comparisons 
involving more than two groups, confidence intervals were esti-
mated using floating absolute risks. Models were adjusted for age 
at study entry, socioeconomic status (measured by the Townsend 
deprivation index), smoking status, systolic blood pressure, body 
mass index (BMI) and history of diabetes mellitus. Subgroup 
analyses were conducted by age (≤60 years vs >60 years), socio-
economic status (Townsend deprivation index at or below vs 
above the English median), smoking status (never vs ever), and 
BMI (≤25 
kg/m2 vs >25 
kg/m2). P values for interaction were 
obtained by adding an interaction term to the models. R version 
3.1.2 was used for all analyses.
resulTs
For women, the mean age at baseline was 56 years, 51% were 
from the most socioeconomically advantaged third of the UK 
population and 60% had never smoked (table 1). The mean age 
at menarche was 13 years, 85% had been pregnant and 44% 
of women had given birth to two children. The mean age at 
first birth was 26 years. T
wenty-five per cent of women had a 
history of miscarriage and 3% had had a stillbirth. Sixty-one per 
cent of women were postmenopausal, with a mean age at natural 
menopause of 50 years. Forty-two per cent of men had fathered 
two children. During a median of 7.1 years (Q1: 6.4; Q3: 7.8) 
follow-up, 9054 incident cases of CVD were recorded (34% 
women), including 5782 cases of CHD (28% women) and 3489 
cases of stroke (43% women).
Age at menarche
Women who had their menarche before the age of 12 years were 
at a higher risk of CVD than those who had their menarche 
at an older age (figure 1 and online supplementary etables 1). 
The age-adjusted HR (95% 
CI) of CVD associated with an early 
menarche (<12 years) was 1.18 (1.09  to 1.29), which attenu-
ated to 1.10 (1.01 to 1.30) following further adjustment, without 
evidence for differences between subpopulations (online supple-
mentary etables 1 and 2). The age-adjusted and multiple-ad-
justed HRs, respectively, associated with an early menarche were 
1.16 (1.03 to 1.30) and 1.05 (0.93 to 1.18) for CHD and 1.22 
(1.08 to 1.37) and 1.17 (1.03 to 1.32) for stroke, with minimal 
differences across subpopulations (online supplementary etables 
1, 3 and 4). The risk of CHD associated with an early menarche 
differed by age group; the adjusted HR was 0.82 (0.67 to 1.01) 
for those ≤60 years and 1.21 (1.04 to 1.41) for those aged > 60 
years (P=0.01) (online supplementary etables 3). Women with a 
later age at menarche did not have a higher risk of CVD, CHD 
or stroke compared with those who had their menarche at 13 
years of age.
number of children
Compared with women and men without children, those with 
children were at a significantly higher risk of CHD, but not of 
CVD or stroke; the multiple-adjusted HRs (95% CI) were 1.21 
(1.05 to 1.40) in women and 1.13 (1.04 to 1.23) in men for CHD 
and 0.97 (0.84 to 1.11) in women and 0.99 (0.88 to 1.11) in men

for stroke (table 2 and online supplementary etables 5 and 6). 
The relationship between the number of children and the risk of 
CVD, CHD and stroke was similar between the sexes (figure 2). 
The adjusted HR for CVD associated with each child was 1.03 
(1.00 to 1.06) in women and 1.03 (1.02 to 1.05) in men. Corre-
sponding HRs for CHD and stroke were 1.06 (1.02 to 1.10) and 
1.01 (0.96 to 1.05) in women and 1.04 (1.02 to 1.06) and 1.01 
(0.98 to 1.05) in men. There was some indication that the risk 
of CVD associated with the number of children in women was 
stronger among those with a higher socioeconomic status and 
ever smokers (P=0.04) (online supplementary etables 2).
Age at first birth
There was an inverse relationship between age at first birth and 
the risk of CVD, CHD and stroke, which attenuated margin-
ally following adjustment for socioeconomic status and lifestyle 
factors (figure 3, table 2 and online supplementary etables 5). 
The adjusted HRs (95% CI) for every year increase in age at first 
birth were 0.97 (0.96 to 0.98) for CVD, 0.96 (0.95 to 0.97) for 
CHD, and 0.98 (0.97 to 0.99) for stroke, with little heteroge-
neity across population subgroups (online supplementary etables 
2–4).
Miscarriage and stillbirth
A history of miscarriage was associated with a higher risk of 
CHD, but not of CVD or stroke; multiple-adjusted HRs (95% 
CI) were 1.07 (0.98 to 1.17) for CVD, 1.14 (1.01 to 1.29) for 
CHD, and 0.98 (0.86 to 1.12) for stroke (table 2). The adjusted 
HRs associated with each miscarriage were 1.04 (1.00 to 1.09) 
for CVD, 1.06 (1.00 to 1.13) for CHD, and 1.01 (0.95 to 1.09) 
for stroke. A history of stillbirth was associated with a higher 
risk of CVD and stroke, but not of CHD; adjusted HRs were 
1.22 (1.01 to 1.46) for CVD, 0.98 (0.74 to 1.28) for CHD, and 
1.44 (1.12 to 1.85) for stroke (table 2). The adjusted HRs asso-
ciated with each additional stillbirth were 1.14 (1.02 to 1.28) 
for CVD, 1.03 (0.85 to 1.24) for CHD, and 1.21 (1.05 to 1.40) 
for stroke. The results were broadly consistent across population 
subgroups (online supplementary etables 2–4). However, there 
was some indication that the risks of CVD and CHD associated 
with a history of miscarriage were stronger among women with 
a higher socioeconomic status (P=0.03) (online supplementary 
etables 2–3).
hysterectomy and oophorectomy
A history of oophorectomy was not associated with the risk of 
CVD, CHD or stroke (table 2 and online supplementary etables 
5). A history of hysterectomy was associated with the risk of 
CVD and CHD, but not of stroke; multiple-adjusted HRs (95% 
CI) were 1.12 (1.03 to 1.22), 1.20 (1.07 to 1.34), and 1.05 (0.93 
to 1.19), respectively. There was no evidence for differences 
between subpopulations (online supplementary etables 2–4). Age 
at oophorectomy and age at hysterectomy were each inversely 
associated with the risk of CVD, CHD and stroke; adjusted HRs 
for CVD were 0.97 (0.95 to 0.98) for a 1 
year increase in age at 
oophorectomy and 0.98 (0.97 to 0.99) for a 1 
year increase in 
age at hysterectomy (table 2). Moreover, the increased risk of 
CVD and CHD, but not of stroke, associated with a history of 
hysterectomy differed by history and timing of oophorectomy, 
with those who had an oophorectomy before hysterectomy at 
the highest risk (figure 4 and online supplementary etables 7).
Age at natural menopause
An early age at natural menopause was associated with a greater 
risk of CVD, CHD and stroke (figure 1 and online supplementary 
Figure 1 Penalised spline plots with adjusted hazard ratios (95% CI) for cardiovascular disease associated with women’s age at menarche and age 
at natural menopause. Analyses are adjusted for age, Townsend deprivation index, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, history of diabetes and

etables 1). The age-adjusted HRs (95% CI) were 1.44 (1.29 
to 1.61) for CVD, 1.43 (1.22 to 1.67) for CHD, and 1.50 (1.28 
to 1.75) for stroke; these attenuated to 1.33 (1.19 to 1.49), 1.29 
(1.10 to 1.51), and 1.42 (1.21 to 1.66), respectively, following 
adjustment for socioeconomic status and lifestyle factors. There 
was no evidence that the associations differed across subpopula-
tions (online supplementary etables 2–4).
dIsCussIon
In this large prospective study of 482 000 women and men in 
the UK Biobank, several common reproductive factors were 
associated with the risk of CVD in later life. Among women, 
early menarche, early menopause, age at first birth, and a 
history of miscarriage, stillbirth or hysterectomy were each 
associated with a higher risk of CVD in later life. The relation-
ship between the number of children and the risk of CVD was 
similar for men and women. While the strengths of the rela-
tionships differed by CVD subtype, the results were broadly 
consistent across major subpopulations and were generally 
robust to adjustment for several socioeconomic and biological 
confounders and mediators.
Our results are in agreement with some, but not all, previous 
studies that reported that early menarche was associated with 
an increased risk of CVD.2 3 6 7 The most comprehensive report 
to date on the association between menarche and CVD risk 
came from the UK Million Women Study, which found a 
U-shaped relationship between age at menarche with CVD risk, 
with both early (≤10 years) and late (≥17 years) menarche 
being associated with an increased risk of CHD and stroke.6 
The mechanisms through which age at menarche is linked to 
CVD risk in later life are uncertain. Menarche is a marker 
of timing of puberty and early menarche has been linked to 
childhood obesity.20 21 Several studies, including ours, have 
shown that an earlier menarche was associated with high 
levels of adiposity in adulthood.18 22 However, the find-
ings of the present study were robust to adjustment for BMI 
and were similar between healthy weight and overweight or 
obese women, suggesting that other mechanisms are involved. 
Genome-wide association studies have reported that age at 
menarche is closely linked to several pathways, including the 
regulation of energy homeostasis, body weight and hormonal 
levels.23 Mendelian randomisation analyses will help to

Cardiac risk factors and prevention
examine whether the link between early menarche and CVD 
risk is causal and which mechanisms are involved.
The present study demonstrated that the association between 
the number of children and the risk of CHD and stroke was 
largely identical between women and men. These findings 
agree with our recent study of 500 000 men and women from 
the China Kadoorie Biobank, which also showed a similar 
increased risk of incident CHD and stroke, as well as inci-
dent diabetes, with an increasing number of children in both 
sexes.13 14 Hence, the link between repeated childbirth and 
CVD risk seen in women may be more likely to be explained by 
social, cultural, psychological and behavioural factors related to 
parenthood and childbearing than by biological factors related 
to pregnancy and childbearing. Previous studies have reported 
that an early age at first birth was associated with unfavour-
able cardiovascular risk profiles in both men and women.24 25 
Thus, it is conceivable that the inverse relationship between age 
at first birth and the risk of later CHD and stroke in women 
reported here is also predominantly explained by factors other 
than reproductive ones.

Cardiac risk factors and prevention
Miscarriage and stillbirth may be aetiologically linked to CVD 
by shared underlying vascular pathology, including systemic 
inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, that could not only 
result in placental dysfunction and pregnancy loss, but may also 
be implicated in the risk of CVD.26–28 A previous meta-analysis 
reported that a history of miscarriage and recurrent miscarriage 
were associated with a higher risk of CHD, but not stroke.8 A 
study among 60 
000 women in Scotland reported that repeated 
miscarriage was associated with an increased risk of CHD, but 
not stroke.29 In contrast, a study of over 1 
million women in 
Denmark found graded relationships between the number of 
miscarriages and the risks of both MI and stroke.11 A history 
of stillbirth has also been associated with increased risks of 
CVD.10 11 This study is the first to suggest that miscarriage is 
more strongly associated with CHD whereas stillbirth is more 
strongly associated with stroke, heightening the need for specific 
research into the pathways through which pregnancy loss is 
implicated in the pathophysiology of vascular disease subtypes.
In agreement with previous studies,5 we observed that an early 
age at natural menopause was associated with a higher risk of 
both CHD and stroke. The higher risk of CVD among women 
with an early menopause has commonly been ascribed to the 
adverse effects of loss of ovarian function and a subsequent defi-
ciency of endogenous oestrogens on a woman’s cardiovascular 
risk profile. However, it has also been suggested that it is not 
menopause that adversely affects cardiovascular risk but rather 
that cardiovascular risk factors determine the age at menopause, 
possibly through direct effects on the endocrine system or by 
inducing ischaemic damage in the ovaries.30 Unlike previous 
studies,5 oophorectomy was not associated with an increased 
risk of CVD in this study. However, age at oophorectomy was 
inversely associated with the risk of CVD in later life, suggesting 
that the timing of surgical removal of the ovaries and subsequent 
abrupt transition into the menopause, rather than the proce-
dure itself, might underpin the previously reported findings. 
A history of hysterectomy was associated with a higher risk of 
CHD, but not of stroke, with some evidence that the higher risk 
was confined to women without concomitant oophorectomy 
or with a previous oophorectomy. In contrast, previous studies 
have suggested that oophorectomy at the time of hysterectomy 
added further to the risk of CVD in pre-menopausal women,15–17 
which could be explained by a more adverse initial risk profile or 
premature ovarian failure and hormone-related effects on serum 
lipids and subclinical atherosclerosis.
The strengths of this study include the large sample size, 
prospective design and availability of detailed information on 
reproductive and other lifestyle factors. Information on the 
number of children and men enabled us to assess the associa-
tion between parity and CVD simultaneously in women and 
men. This study also has some limitations. First, information 
on reproductive factors was self-reported and solicited several 
years after the reproductive events occurred. This could have 
led to measurement error, which, if at random, would have

Key messages
What is already known about this subject?
It is often hypothesised that certain factors relating to 
reproduction and pregnancy may have an adverse effect on a 
woman’s future risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Findings 
in previous studies have, however, been mixed, leading to an 
inconclusive evidence base.
What does this study add?
This large prospective study found that early menarche, early 
menopause, earlier age at first birth, and a history of miscarriage, 
stillbirth or hysterectomy, were each associated with a higher 
risk of CVD in later life, after controlling for key cardiovascular 
risk factors. Women who had given birth to more children also 
had higher subsequent CVD risk, but this is unlikely to have been 
due to a biological cause, as some have hypothesised, because a 
similar effect was found when analysing the number of children 
fathered by men.
how might this impact on clinical practice?
More frequent cardiovascular screening would seem to be 
sensible among women who are early in their reproductive 
cycle, or who have a history of adverse reproductive events or a 
hysterectomy, as this might help to delay or prevent their onset 
of CVD. Cardiovascular risk stratification that accounts for key 
reproductive factors should be considered to help address the 
considerable CVD risk among women.

underestimated the true strengths of the observed associations. 
Second, although our findings were robust to adjustment for 
several major confounders, the observed associations may have 
been subject to unmeasured or residual confounding, particularly 
those related to physiological, cultural or socioeconomic factors 
early in life and before or during pregnancy. Our results may also 
have been liable to reverse causality as certain conditions, such as 
childhood obesity or type 1 diabetes, may determine a woman’s 
reproductive life course and may also confer a higher risk of 
cardiovascular conditions in later life. Furthermore, despite the 
large sample size, the number of events was limited in some of 
the analyses. Finally, no data were available on several pregnan-
cy-related factors that have been shown to be associated with 
the risk of CVD in later life, including breastfeeding, gestational 
diabetes, gestational obesity, preeclampsia and polycystic ovary 
syndrome.
In conclusion, this large prospective study among 482 
000 
women and men in the UK Biobank demonstrated that several 
reproductive factors are associated with the risk of CVD in later 
life. Future studies are needed to confirm the present findings 
and to clarify the biological, behavioural and social mechanisms 
involved.
