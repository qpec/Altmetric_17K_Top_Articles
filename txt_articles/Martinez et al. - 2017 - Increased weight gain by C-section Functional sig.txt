Epidemiological evidence supports a direct association between early microbiota impact—including C-section—and
obesity. We performed antibiotic-free, fostered C-sections and determined the impact on the early microbiota and
body weight during development. Mice in the C-section group gained more body mass after weaning, with a
stronger phenotype in females. C-section–born mice lacked the dynamic developmental gut microbiota changes
observed in control mice. The results demonstrate a causal relationship between C-section and increased body
weight, supporting the involvement of maternal vaginal bacteria in normal metabolic development.
INTRODUCTION
C-section is a lifesaving practice that is needed in 10 to 15% of births
to avoid risking the life of mother or child (1, 2). However, C-section
delivery is often overused, with some regions of the world reaching
43% of births (3). Concomitantly with the increase in C-section, obesity
(4–6) and immune-related diseases [type 1 diabetes (7, 8), allergies
(3, 9), and celiac disease (10)] are on the rise.
C-section circumvents natural exposure to the vaginal microbiota
during labor and birth and, in addition, involves preventive antibiotics,
which have also been related to increased risk of the modern diseases
mentioned above. Early impacts on the developing microbiota lead
to increased obesity in animal models (11, 12). Here, we determined the
effect of antibiotic-free, fostered C-sections on body weight gain and gut
microbiota during early development in mice.

 RESULTS
C-section causes increased body weight gain
A total of 34 C-section–born fostered mice were compared with 35
control mice (fig. S1). C-section–delivered mice showed higher post-
weaning body mass gain (Fig. 1) and totalbody mass(fig. S2), in relation
to vaginally delivered controls. Overall, mice gained 33% more weight
at age 15 weeks if they were born by C-section, but females showed a
stronger phenotypic effect, with 70% higher weight gain (Fig. 1), and
with body masses similar to those of males (fig. S2). Mice that were
delivered by C-section also showed a marginal increase in the pro-
portion of body fat at 15 weeks of age, as determined by dual-energy
x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA; fig. S3).These results are consistent with
the epidemiological association between C-section and increased risk
of obesity (4, 13–16).
C-section causes abnormal development of the
fecal microbiota
By examining the early gut microbiota during the 4 weeks following
weaning, we observed a significant segregation by delivery mode [anal-
ysis of similarities (ANOSIM), P = 0.001; Fig. 2 and figs. S4 to S8], in
both genders and at all time points. Segregation by delivery mode was
highest in female mice (fig. S5). Maturation of the microbiome structure
in control mice occurred with a progressive approximation (reduction
of UniFrac distances) to the fecal microbiota of 6-week-old animals.
However, C-section mice showed no major changes in microbiome
maturity or structure (Fig. 2, C and D) over the same 4-week period.
Fecal microbiota diversity in control animals was highest at weaning
and decreased with age (Fig. 3A and fig. S9), unlike in C-section–
delivered mice that had a significantly lower a diversity at weaning,
which increased with age (Fig. 3A). a diversity differenceswere consistent
acrossdifferentmetrics[phylogenetic diversity(PD)whole tree,observed
species, and Shannon index; Fig. 3 and figs. S7, S10, and S11]. Birth
mode–discriminatory underrepresented taxa in C-section mice at
weaning included Bacteroides, Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and
Clostridiales, and overrepresented taxa included S24.7, Lactobacillus, and
Erysipelotrichaceae (Fig. 3, B to D, and fig. S11). In general, the
proportions of dominant taxa discriminant for birth mode decreased
throughout the first 3 weeks after weaning (fig. S8).

 DISCUSSION
One limitation of this work is that we could not tell with precision
when the phenotype arose before weaning, which is the time when
the C-section offspring had already gained significantly more weight
than the vaginally born controls (fig. S2). Regardless, developmental
weight gains occur at increasingly higher rates in C-section–born
animals than in control animals.
Unlike the procedure in humans, C-sections were performed in this
work without the use of perinatal antibiotics. The compounded effect of
both C-sections and antibiotics is unknown but would be expected to be
strongerontheoffspringphenotypethanC-sectionalone.Anotherdiffer-
encewithhumanC-sectionsisthatourmouseC-sectioninvolvesfostering

EarlygutmicrobiotaabnormalitiesassociatedwithC-sectionarecon-
sistent with alterations in bacterial modulation of development in rela-
tion to the normal pioneer maternal microbiota, which protects from
excessive weight gain. The bacterial taxa found here that are associated
withvaginaldelivery (Bacteroides, Ruminococcaceae, and Clostridiales)
have previously been associated with lean phenotypes in mice (11, 17).
Further research is needed to identify the antiobesogenic individual
taxon or combination of taxa responsible for the effects observed here.
The results of this work support the idea that birth acquisition of ma-
ternal vaginal microbes is needed for normal metabolic development
and present important new information of significance in the context
of the global obesity epidemics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice
Experiments were approved by the New York University School of
Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (NYUSoM
IACUC) (protocol IACUC 16-00878). Conventional outbred Swiss
Webster mice were maintained under a 12-hour light cycle and fed
autoclaved low-fat chow (Purina Pico Rodent #5053). Adult female
mice (n = 11) from Taconic Biosciences were time-mated. On gesta-
tional day E19, five pregnant females underwent C-section [n = 34
pups (18 males and 16 females)], and litters were fostered by mothers
that had delivered vaginally within the previous 48 hours. Six control
dams delivered vaginally [n = 35 pups (21 males and 14 females); fig.
S1]. Body weight was measured weekly, from weaning to week 15 of
age, and fecal samples were collected during early development, from
weaning to week 6 of age. DEXA was performed at 15 weeks of age.
DNA extraction and sequencing
Total DNA was extracted from fecal samples using the MoBio PowerSoil
kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions, modified as described
in the Earth Microbiome Project protocol (http://press.igsb.anl.gov/
earthmicrobiome/protocols-and-standards/dna-extractionprotocol/).
The V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene was amplified
by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using barcoded primers, as previ-
ously described (18). Reagents for DNA extraction and for PCR
amplification were sequenced as controls (19). The amplicons were
pooled in equimolar ratios and were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq
platform (Genome Technology Center of NYU Medical Center) using a
paired-end technique. 16S rRNA sequences were uploaded to the public
database Qiita (study ID #11156).
Data analysis
The effect of delivery mode on the changes in body weight was evalu-
ated by ANOVA test, with resampling. The 16S rRNA gene sequence
analyses were performed with the QIIME suite of software tools (v1.9)
(20). The filtered sequence reads (Phred Q ≥ 20) were used to pick the
operational taxonomic units (OTUs), with an open-reference OTU
picking method based on 97% identity to entries in the Greengenes
database (v13_8). After the chimeric sequences were removed using
ChimeraSlayer (21), communities were rarefied to 3100 reads per sam-
ple. The unweighted/weighted UniFrac distances (22) were calculated
to obtain the pairwise b diversity (similarities between two commu-
nities), which was further evaluated by ANOSIM test using the vegan
package in R to test the significance of delivery mode with 999 permu-
tations. The effect of age on microbial community was analyzed by
comparing the UniFrac distance between fecal communities at any

 age and those from vaginally born mice at week 6, using ANOVA test,
with resampling. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) (23)
was used to search for bacterial taxa that had the largest effects on
discriminating grouping factors, that is, delivery mode, by a combi-
nation of uni- and multivariate analysis. On the basis of microbial com-
munity composition, a random forest model was built with fecal
samples from vaginally delivered mice as the training set to predict
the maturity indices of mice born via C-section using the randomForest
package in R, as previously reported (24).
