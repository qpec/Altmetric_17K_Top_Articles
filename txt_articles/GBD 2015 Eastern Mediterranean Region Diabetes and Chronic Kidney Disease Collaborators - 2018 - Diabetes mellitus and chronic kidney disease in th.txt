Abstract
Objectives We used findings from the Global Burden of
Disease 2015 study to update our previous publication on
the burden of diabetes and chronic kidney disease due to
diabetes (CKD-DM) during 1990–2015.
Methods We extracted GBD 2015 estimates for preva-
lence,
mortality,
and
disability-adjusted
life
years
(DALYs) of diabetes (including burden of low vision due
to diabetes, neuropathy, and amputations and CKD-DM for
22 countries of the EMR from the GBD visualization tools.
Results In 2015, 135,230 (95% UI 123,034–148,184)
individuals died from diabetes and 16,470 (95% UI
13,977–18,961) from CKD-DM, 216 and 179% increases,
respectively, compared to 1990. The total number of peo-
ple with diabetes was 42.3 million (95% UI 38.6–46.4
million) in 2015. DALY rates of diabetes in 2015 were
significantly higher than the expected rates based on Socio-
demographic Index (SDI).
Conclusions Our study showed a large and increasing
burden of diabetes in the region. There is an urgency in
dealing with diabetes and its consequences, and these
efforts should be at the forefront of health prevention and
promotion.

Introduction
Diabetes is an important cause of disability and death
around the world and is a major risk factor for other dis-
eases (GBD 2015 DALYs/HALE Collaborators 2016;
Moradi-Lakeh et al. 2016b). The World Health Organiza-
tion Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) has the highest
age-standardized rate of disability-adjusted life years
(DALYs) from diabetes (GBD 2015 DALYs/HALE Col-
laborators 2016; Institute for Health Metrics and Evalua-
tion 2016). Analysis of the global burden of disease (GBD)
2013 study showed that the increasing burden of diabetes
in the EMR in recent decades is beyond that expected
based on the demographic changes of population growth
and aging, and is also due to increases in age-specific
DALY rates (Mokdad et al. 2016; Moradi-Lakeh et al.
2016b). This increasing trend has been reported by other
studies as well (Sozmen et al. 2015) and is mainly because
of the epidemics of obesity and physical inactivity as the
main risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus (Mokdad
et al. 2014, 2016; Sozmen et al. 2015).
Tracking of personal health spending in the United
States shows that diabetes imposes the highest health care
spending (Dieleman et al. 2016). International Diabetes
Federation estimated US $17.1–27.7 billion is spent

 annually in the Middle East and North Africa on diabetes,
an amount which is expected to double by 2040 (IDF
2015). In this report, we present estimates of the burden of
diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease due to dia-
betes mellitus (CKD-DM) from the Global Burden of
Disease 2015 study.
Methods
GBD 2015 covers 195 countries, 21 regions, and seven
super-regions from 1990 to 2015 for 315 diseases and inju-
ries, 2619 sequelae, and 79 risk factors by age and sex.
Detailed descriptions of GBD 2015 methodology and
specific diabetes mellitus methodology have been provided
elsewhere (GBD 2015 DALYs/HALE Collaborators 2016;
GBD 2015 Disease and Injury Incidence and Prevalence
Collaborators 2016; Duncan et al. 2017; Moradi-Lakeh et al.
2016b; GBD 2015 Causes of Death Collaborators 2016).
We evaluated the burden of diabetes and CKD-DM in
22 EMR countries: Afghanistan, Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt,
Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco,
Pakistan, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan,
Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Yemen.
The total population of the EMR is over 580 million
people.
Diabetes mellitus in GBD is considered both as a disease
and a metabolic risk factor. In this study, we focus on its
burden as a disease. The burden of uncomplicated diabetes,
vision loss caused by diabetes (moderate low vision, severe
low vision, and blindness), diabetic neuropathy, diabetic
foot due to neuropathy, and amputation are included in the
burden of diabetes (Duncan et al. 2017; Moradi-Lakeh
et al. 2016b). Also, we estimated burden of CKD-DM as
part of the chronic kidney disease burden.
All-cause mortality envelopes (total number of deaths)
were first estimated for each country during the period of
1990–2015. For this purpose, we used all accessible data
from vital registration systems, sibling history surveys,
sample registration data, and household recall of deaths.
We extracted causes of death data from the same sources,
as well as available verbal autopsies, and then used cause
of death ensemble modeling to estimate the number of
deaths from diabetes and CKD-DM by age, sex, country,
and year (GBD 2015 DALYs/HALE Collaborators 2016;
Duncan et al. 2017; Moradi-Lakeh et al. 2016b). In this
approach, a large variety of possible models are explored to
estimate trends in causes of death. Possible models are
identified based on a covariate selection algorithm that
yields several plausible combinations of covariates; they
are then run through different model classes, including
mixed effects linear models and spatiotemporal Gaussian
process regression models for cause fractions and death
rates. All models for each cause of death are then assessed
using out-of-sample predictive validity and combined into
an ensemble with optimal out-of-sample predictive per-
formance (Foreman et al. 2012).
We updated our previous systematic review for the GBD
study separately for non-fatal outcomes of diabetes melli-
tus and CKD-DM. Data on incidence, prevalence, and
excess mortality were extracted from data sources. We
assumed no remission for diabetes. Bayesian meta-regres-
sion analysis through DisMod-MR 2.1 was used for disease
modeling.
Model-based
epidemiological
estimates
in
combination with disability weights were used to calculate
cause-specific years lived with disability (YLDs) for each
age, sex, location, and year. DALYs were calculated
through summation of years of life lost (YLLs) and YLDs
(GBD 2015 DALYs/HALE Collaborators 2016; GBD 2015
Disease and Injury Incidence and Prevalence Collaborators
2016).
In GBD 2015, we used country-location estimates of a
composite Socio-demographic Index (SDI) based on the
geometric mean of income per capita, average years of
schooling in individuals older than 15 years, and total
fertility rate. The numbers were rescaled to a number
between zero and one, based on highest and lowest coun-
try-location measures. In 2015, SDI had a range between
0.1506 (Somalia) and 0.8747 (United Arab Emirates) in the
EMR. We used SDI to estimate expected burden for each
disease based on the demographic and social conditions of
each country in each year (GBD 2015 DALYs/HALE
Collaborators 2016).
We report 95% uncertainty intervals (UI) for each
estimate, including rates, numbers of deaths, and DALYs.
We estimated UIs by taking 1000 samples from the pos-
terior distribution of each quantity and using the 25th and
975th-ordered draw of the uncertainty distribution.
Results
In 2015, 135,230 (95% UI 123,034–148,184) individuals died
from diabetes and 16,470 (95% UI 13,977–18,961) from
CKD-DM in the EMR. These numbers represent 216 and
179% increases in the number of deaths due to diabetes and
CKD-DM, respectively, compared to 1990. Figure 1 shows
this increasing trend is not only for the number of deaths, but
also for all ages and age-standardized mortality rates.
The total number of people with diabetes in the EMR in
2015 was 42.3 million (95% UI 38.6–46.4 million). The
highest prevalence rates of DM and CKD-DM were
observed among those aged 70–79 years old; however, the
highest numbers of cases were among the younger age
groups. The patterns of prevalence were similar in both
sexes (Fig. 2).

 Total DALYs from diabetes were 6,708,539 (95% UI
5,451,990–8,148,834) in 2015 and 2,285,117 (95% UI
1,892,297–2,792,790)
in
1990.
For
CKD-DM,
total
DALYs were 568,351 (95% UI 490,064–653,946) in 2015
and 234,194 (95% UI: 201,911–272,837) in 1990. In 2015,
the proportion of YLLs to DALYs was 45% for diabetes
mellitus and 73% for CKD-DM.
The burden of diabetes mellitus as a percentage of total
DALYs was 1.1% (95% UI 1.0–1.3%) in 1990 and
increased to 2.9% (95% CI 2.6–3.3%) in 2015. These
percentage were 0.11% (95% UI 0.10–0.13%) and 0.25%
(95% CI 0.22–0.28%) for CKD-DM in 1990 and 2015,
respectively. The age-standardized observed DALY rate of
diabetes in the EMR was higher than in all other WHO
regions. Also, observed DALY rates of diabetes in the
EMR were higher than the expected (based on SDI) values
(Fig. 3). However, observed DALY rates for CKD-DM
were less than the expected rates (Fig. 4).

Discussion
Our study showed that the burden of diabetes has increased
considerably during the last 25 years in the EMR. This
burden is higher than expected based on the demographic
and social status of the countries in the region. Clearly, the
region’s health systems have not performed at the expected
level, given their socio-demographic status, to control and
prevent diabetes and CKD. This is in contrast to the
European region and Western Pacific region, where
observed levels are lower than expected levels. There are
several potential reasons for such differenced: people in the
EMR have lower perceived risk, and access to and quality
of health care are lesser in this region (Mokdad et al. 2014;
Moradi-Lakeh et al. 2016b) Our results call for urgent
efforts to address the burden of diabetes in the region.
Several interventions have been suggested for preven-
tion and control of diabetes. Although the effectiveness and
cost-effectiveness of all interventions are not promising,
there is evidence of several successful experiences around
the world (Davies et al. 2017; Sun et al. 2017). For
example,
the
National
Diabetes
Prevention
Program
showed successful changes in determinants of diabetes (Ely
et al. 2017). Indeed, a multi-sectorial approach is needed to
control and prevent diabetes in the region. WHO suggests
the Package of Essential Non-communicable (PEN) Dis-
ease Interventions to be used in primary health care in low-

 resource settings. PEN is a prioritized set of cost-effective
interventions,
tools,
and
aids
to
deliver
an
accept-
able quality of care in the primary health care setting. Such
interventions are feasible for adoption by most counties in
the region (Zhang et al. 2016). For instance, Iran launched
an adopted version, called IraPEN, with specific targets for
prevention and control of non-communicable diseases. On
the other hand, ‘‘Screen and Treat’’ strategies are unlikely
to have a substantial impact to reduce the diabetes epi-
demic. Therefore, they should be complemented by popu-
lation-wide approaches for effective diabetes prevention
(Barry et al. 2017).
EMR countries are at different stages of prevention and
control of diabetes; all high-income countries except Oman
(Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab
Emirates), some of the middle-income EMR countries
(Iran, Jordan, Lebanon, and Tunisia), and none of the low-
income EMR countries have an operational policy, strat-
egy, or plan of action for diabetes (WHO 2017).
CKD mortality increased in recent years in the region,
underscoring the need for better treatment and management
of blood pressure and diabetes. Diagnosis and control of
diabetes and blood pressure are not optimal in the region.
Early detection through screening of high-risk individuals
is crucial to control blood pressure and diabetes and reduce
diabetes and CKD burden and mortality. Although evi-
dence is not strong enough to conclude that early diagnosis
of diabetes will increase survival, treatment of impaired
glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose, as well as
lifestyle interventions, is associated with delayed progres-
sion to diabetes (Selph et al. 2015a, b). There is a need for
more aggressive programs to control blood pressure and
diabetes
that
include
medical
and
preventive
care
approaches.
Access to and quality of medical care has a major
impact on mortality from diabetes and CKD (Alegre-Diaz
et al. 2016). Several studies have suggested that proper
treatment might reduce complications and improve out-
comes. Both diabetes and CKD require patients to adhere
to long-term management of the condition (Brunton and
Polonsky 2017). Unfortunately, not all the region’s resi-
dents have equal access to quality medical care. It is

 possible that proper management of these conditions varies
by county and has led to the observed increases in
mortality.
Several studies have shown that obesity has rapidly
increased in the region during the time period of this study
(Mokdad et al. 2014, 2016). The studies have shown that
inadequate physical activity and high body mass index are
common in the region (El Bcheraoui et al. 2016). More-
over, dietary factors are among the major risk factors for
diabetes and CKD (Moradi-Lakeh et al. 2016b; Yakoob
et al. 2016). For example, low intake of whole grains, nuts
and seeds, and fruit, and the consumption of processed
food and red meats are known risk factor for diabetes; and
high sodium intake is an important risk factor for CKD
(Afshin et al. 2015; Moradi-Lakeh et al. 2016b). Diet has
not improved much in the region during the study period
(Afshin et al. 2015; Melaku et al. 2016; Otto et al. 2016).
Moreover, there is only limited local information on diet-
ary habits in the region (Afshin et al. 2015; Moradi-Lakeh
et al. 2017). There is a need for programs to improve diet
and physical activity and to control weight gain in the
region to reduce the burden of diabetes as well as many
other conditions. Only a few EMR countries have an
operational policy, strategy, or plan of action to reduce
obesity and physical inactivity (WHO 2017). The countries
need to target different age groups, especially youth, to
initiate sustainable changes in lifestyle. High intake of
processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages, and salt, and
low intake of fruits and vegetables and whole grains need
to be specifically addressed with regard to obesity, dia-
betes, and CKD-DM (Mokdad et al. 2016; Moradi-Lakeh
et al. 2016a, 2017a; Ng et al. 2014).
Our study has a few limitations. For many countries
with sparse data, estimates were driven by covariates in
statistical modeling. The attributable effect of high body
mass index (BMI) on ischemic heart disease, stroke, and
diabetes was derived from prospective observational stud-
ies and meta-analyses. Our study does not account for
variation within countries. We also do not have adequate
data on access to and quality of health care in the region.
More details on these limitations have been published
elsewhere (Moradi-Lakeh et al. 2016b). On the other hand,
we used new data for some countries, such as Saudi Arabia,
which changed our estimates compared to GBD 2013 (El
Bcheraoui et al. 2014; Moradi-Lakeh et al. 2016b).
Conclusion
Our study showed a large and increasing burden of diabetes
in the region. This burden will increase with aging and
growth of the population unless effective programs for
control and prevention are put in place. Diabetes is a costly
disease and most countries in the region spend a large
percentage of their health resources on the disease. The
region’s financial and manpower resources are already
stretched. Hence, there is an urgency to deal with diabetes
and its consequences, and these efforts should be at the
forefront of disease prevention and health promotion.
