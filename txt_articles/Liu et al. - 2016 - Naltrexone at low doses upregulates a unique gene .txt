Abstract. It has been reported that lower doses of the opioid 
antagonist naltrexone are able to reduce tumour growth by 
interfering with cell signalling as well as by modifying the 
immune system. We have evaluated the gene expression profile 
of a cancer cell line after treatment with low-dose naltrexone 
(LDN), and assessed the effect that adapting treatment sched-
ules with LDN may have on enhancing efficacy. LDN had a 
selective impact on genes involved with cell cycle regulation 
and immune modulation. Similarly, the pro-apoptotic genes 
BAD and BIK1 were increased only after LDN. Continuous 
treatment with LDN had little effect on growth in different 
cell lines; however, altering the treatment schedule to include 
a phase of culture in the absence of drug following an initial 
round of LDN treatment, resulted in enhanced cell killing. 
Furthermore, cells pre-treated with LDN were more sensitive 
to the cytotoxic effects of a number of common chemotherapy 
agents. For example, priming HCT116 with LDN before treat-
ment with oxaliplatin significantly increased cell killing to 
49±7.0 vs. 14±2.4% in cultures where priming was not used. 
Interestingly, priming with NTX before oxaliplatin resulted in 
just 32±1.8% cell killing. Our data support further the idea that 
LDN possesses anticancer activity, which can be improved by 
modifying the treatment schedule.
Introduction
A number of reports have identified a putative anticancer role 
for naltrexone when used at doses lower than those conven-
tionally administered (1). In particular, it has been shown 
that these low doses of naltrexone (LDN) are able to suppress 
tumour growth. A definitive mechanism of action has yet to 
be established, but what is known is that the effect can be via 
modifications to the host immune system rendering it more 
anticancer in nature, or through direct antagonism of tumour 
growth. Naltrexone, being a specific antagonist of the opioid 
receptors, can influence the activity of intracellular signal-
ling pathways found downstream of the G protein-coupled 
receptor. As the net actions of these pathways determine the 
fate of cells, naltrexone, as well as other opiates, is able to 
alter cellular function, and induce cell death (2-5). Indeed, in 
addition to their universally accepted analgesic qualities, the 
opioids have also been widely reported to elicit a number of 
other cellular responses that lead to reductions in tumours.
Studies investigating the intracellular effects of naltrexone 
noted that the mechanism underlying the action of opioids 
generally involved, in part, modulation of the PI3-kinase 
cascade (6,7). This suggested that these agents may be able 
to influence the growth and survival of cancer cells. However, 
the literature surrounding this is still very unclear, and can 
be contradictory. Reports have simultaneously shown the 
archetypal opiate morphine is able to both inhibit the growth 
of cancer cells as well as to stimulate them in vitro. As some 
of these cancer cell lines express relatively low levels of the 
opioid receptors (8), the effects on growth may be independent 
of them. Furthermore, as both the pro- and anticancer effects 
have been seen in animal model systems with intact immunity, 
it has been postulated that morphine may affect the immune 
response (9), although, this remains inconclusive (10).
Naltrexone has been demonstrated to have a very diverse 
range of effects on cells. Some are pro-survival in nature such 
as the induction of proliferation and protection against cell 
death, whereas others are associated with growth inhibition 
and the induction of apoptosis. This diversity has made it 
difficult to establish the principal mechanism of action. The 
ultimate consequence of treatment with naltrexone however, 
appears to be determined by dose and schedule (6). Essentially, 
naltrexone exhibits non-cytotoxic anticancer activities and as 
such, may be best combined with other modalities and combi-
nation schedules that maximise the individual action of each 
partner (11). Furthermore, the use of drugs concomitantly may 
Naltrexone at low doses upregulates a unique  
gene expression not seen with normal doses:

allow the individual elements to prime for the effects of another 
and result in a therapeutic synergy. These schedules may also 
involve adaptations in the sequence in which the agents are 
employed, and is especially true if the strategy involves a 
combination of a chemotherapy and an immune adjuvant (11). 
Determining the best combinatorial partner for naltrexone 
requires careful consideration, as drugs with characteristics 
that are unsuitable together can result in antagonism, disrup-
tion to the effects of the individual drugs and consequential 
loss of overall activity.
Here, we describe part of our ongoing studies that explore 
the anticancer properties of agents that are not cytotoxic nor 
typically anticancer in application. We have performed a gene 
expression screen in a cancer cell line previously used to 
study other known anticancer drugs to determine the profile 
of naltrexone action. Specifically, we have studied the genetic 
impact when used at a dose that is typically employed clinically 
as well as at a lower concentration. Using this information, we 
then examined the effect that different treatment strategies and 
schedules have on the efficacy of this drug in vitro.
Materials and methods
Cell culture and drugs. All cell lines were purchased from the 
European Collection of Cell Cultures (Salisbury, UK), and 
maintained and grown in the culture medium specified by the 
depositor. Specifically, the principal cell lines used in this study 
were HCT116 (human colorectal cancer) and A549 (human 
lung cancer), which were cultured in DMEM (Sigma) supple-
mented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS: Life Technologies, 
Paisley, UK) and 2 mM L-glutamine (Life Technologies). All 
cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in 
air at 37˚C, and discarded after ~12 passages. Authentication 
of the cell lines was performed by the service providers using 
the AmpFISTR Identifier Plus PCR amplification kit looking 
for the presence of <10 known loci for each cell line.
Naltrexone hydrochloride (naltrexone), cyclophospha-
mide (CPM), gemcitabine (GEM) and oxaliplatin (OXP) (all 
Sigma Ltd., Dorset, UK) were dissolved in DMSO, with the 
final DMSO concentration in individual tests being <0.05%. 
Preliminary studies suggested the action of naltrexone was 
dependent upon concentration; therefore, two concentration-
ranges were assessed. Conventional doses were >1 µM and 
designated as NTX, whilst low doses of naltrexone (LDN) 
were <100 nM. Typical NTX concentrations were 1 and 
10 µM, whereas LDN concentrations were 3-log lower being 
1 and 10 nM.
RNA extraction and microarray analysis. The genomic arm 
of this study followed a similar path to one we have published 
a number of times (12-15). Briefly, exponentially growing 
cells were seeded into 6-well plates (BD Biosciences, Oxford, 
UK) at a concentration of 2x105/well and were left to adhere 
overnight. Cells were then treated for 4 h with NTX (10 µM) 
or LDN (10 nM), before RNA was extracted and processed as 
described previously (13).
Samples were then processed for microarray analysis 
according to the methodologies detailed previously (13). 
Briefly, equal amounts of biotinylated cRNA was hybridised 
to the Illumina human HT12-v3 arrays (Applied Biosystems, 
Warrington, UK) for 18 h and subsequently processed 
according to manufacturer's instructions before scanning 
on an Illumina BeadArray Reader (Applied Biosystems). 
The image data were processed using default values in 
GenomeStudio v2009.1 with imputation of missing data, 
before loading onto GeneSpring v9.0 for data normalisation 
and filtering. A >0.25-fold change was used as our cut-off 
magnitude for gene list compositions by using Excel software.
Proliferation assays. To study the effect of naltrexone on cell 
growth, cells growing exponentially were added to 96-well 
plates at a density of 3x104/well. LDN and/or NTX was then 
added to the wells, ensuring an equal volume of 200 µl across 
the plate. Cell number was measured at 72 h using a standard 
methylthiazoltetrazolium (MTT)-based assay as described 
previously (16).
Immunoblotting analysis. Following individual treatments, 
cells were then harvested by scraping into lysis buffer (New 
England Biolabs, Hitchin, UK), and standard western blot 
protocols were followed as described previously (16). Primary 
probing was performed with specific antibodies generated 
against p21, cyclin D1, cyclin B1, BAD, BAX, phosphory-
lated (p) AKT, AKT, pERK, ERK and tollip (all New England 
Biolabs). Anti-GAPDH (New England Biolabs) was used as 
a loading control. All antibodies were used at a dilution of 
1:1,000, followed by the appropriate HRP conjugated secondary 
antibodies (New England Biolabs) also at a dilution of 1:1,000. 
Bands were visualised by the SuperSignal chemiluminescent 
detection system (Thermo Scientific, Northumberland, UK). 
Densitometry of band intensity was determined using Adobe 
Photoshop CS3, v10.0 (Maidenhead, UK), and normalised to 
the loading control.
Recovery studies. A549 and HCT116 cells were seeded into 
6-well plates at a density of 2x105/well and left to adhere 
overnight. Cells were then cultured with NTX (1 and 10 µM) 
and LDN (1 and 10 nM). Drug-containing media was removed 
after 48 h, and cells were rinsed gently with drug-free 
medium. Fresh culture medium was then added to the cells 
with or without naltrexone at their matching concentrations, 
and incubated for a further 24 h. Cell number and viability 
were assessed at 48 h (pre-recovery) and 72 h (post-recovery), 
with percentages of live and dead cells being discriminated 
by trypan blue dye exclusion. Cells were also processed for 
the determination of cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry 
utilising the nucleic acid stain propidium iodide (16).
Combination studies. The impact of combining LDN with 
other chemotherapy agents was tested by culturing cells 
according to a treatment schedule that involved two phases 
of treatment. The first phase involved priming with LDN or 
NTX for 48 h, before treatment with another drug for a further 
48 h. A549 and HCT116 cells were seeded into 6-well plates 
at a density of 2x105/well and left to adhere overnight. Cells 
were then cultured with 10 nM LDN or 10 µM NTX. Drug-
containing media was removed after 48 h, and cells were 
rinsed gently with drug-free medium. Fresh culture medium 
that contained CPM, GEM or OXP was then added to the cells. 
The concentrations of the chemotherapy agents used were

~1/4 IC50 as established previously (17). Cells were then left 
for a further 48 h before cell counting and processing for flow 
cytometry and western blotting.
Results
Different patterns of genes are affected by NTX and LDN. 
Standard unsupervised microarray analysis of the transcrip-
tome of cells following treatment with NTX or LDN was 
performed to understand the patterns of genes that were 
altered at the different doses. It also served to possibly identify 
novel targets of naltrexone, which could explain further the 
anticancer effects associated with its use.
Following the initial filtering and removal of nonsense 
genes from the gene microarray chip, 15,012/27,132 (55%) 
genes were judged present in at least one of the treatment 
conditions. Although a large proportion of these were present 
in all conditions, 12,275/15,012 (82%) (Fig. 1A), some were 
unique to a particular condition. We therefore focused next 
on those genes that, when compared to untreated cells, were 
specifically altered following treatment with NTX or with 
LDN (Fig. 1B). The majority of genes that were either down- 
or upregulated were the same irrespective of the treatment 
being NTX or LDN. However, there was a proportion of genes 
that changed specifically in response to either NTX or LDN. 
For example, concentrating on those genes (n=930) that were 
downregulated by treatment, 448 were common to both NTX 
and LDN; however, 214 were unique to NTX and 168 to LDN. 
Full gene lists are available at ArrayExpress (www.ebi.ac.uk - 
accession no. E-MTAB-4454).
A number of gene lists were made that recorded those 
down- and upregulated by treatment with different doses. 
Specific examination of the top 20 genes in these lists revealed 
a number of genes that were of interest to us such as the paired 
immunoglobin-like type 2 receptor α (PILRA), which is 
involved in the regulation of the immune system, and the pro-
apoptotic gene BAK1. Both were increased significantly by 
LDN but not NTX (Table I). This highlighted the possibility 
that NTX and LDN affect different groups of genes. Therefore, 
we next used gene ontology (GO) and grouped the genes with 
changes in their expression according to their molecular func-
tion and biological process. Results showed some cross-over 
in the genes that were altered by the different treatments. We 
next focussed specifically on the groups of genes that were 
uniquely altered by NTX or LDN, and we saw that a number of 
the GO-categories that were upregulated exclusively by LDN 
were associated with cell cycling (Fig. 1B-b). This directed 
us to specifically examine genes that directly regulated the 
Table I. Top 20 genes induced by treatment with naltrexone.a

cell cycle to see if there was any divergence of changes in 
them caused by treatment with LDN or NTX. Results showed 
they were generally altered by a similar magnitude through 
treatment with both NTX and LDN; however, there were four 
exceptions, in that CDK1, 4, 6 and cyclin B1 were affected 
differently (Table II).
NTX and LDN alter the expressions of key proteins. To confirm 
and assess the effects that treatments had on targets identified 
by the microarray screen, western blotting was performed on 
whole cell lysates harvested from HCT116 cells treated with 
NTX or LDN. The choice of proteins that were assessed was 
guided by the lists from the microarray expression data, and 
selected upon the basis of the magnitude of their differential 
expressions. Results indicated that the selective increases in 
some cell cycle related genes following treatment with LDN 
were recapitulated by increased protein expression (Fig. 2). 
Other notable proteins that corresponded with the gene data 
included BAD and TOLLIP, which were increased following 
culture with LDN but not with NTX. These were notable as 
both were involved in determining the level of cell death by 
regulating apoptosis and autophagy, respectively. AKT and 
ERK were also prospectively included as a way of assessing 
the general signalling status of the cell, and results indicated 
that they were impacted upon to a similar magnitude by NTX 
and LDN.
A break in treatment (recovery phase) enhances the cytotoxic 
effect of LDN. MTT assays were used to assess the effect of 
naltrexone on a variety of cell lines from different tissues, 
and results showed the effect on cell numbers was minimal. 
Extrapolated IC50 concentrations for all the cell lines were 
>100 M (Fig. 3A). Our previous studies have shown that the 
cytotoxicity of some agents can be increased by employing 
a break in treatment, the effect of which is associated with 
disturbances in cell cycling dynamics (16,18,19). As cell 
cycling has been implicated as being important in this study, 
we next tested the possibility that a recovery phase may

aCells were treated with LDN (10 nM naltrexone) or NTX (10 µM naltrexone) for 4 h. Cells were then harvested using trypsin, and RNA was extracted using 
TRIzol. Gene expression analysis was performed using the Illumina array system, and only genes related to cell cycle control and called present in at least one 
treatment included in the lists. Genes were categorised based upon cell cycle phase, and those altered by >10% in either direction are in bold.

enhance cell killing. A549 and HCT116 cells were cultured 
with LDN or NTX for 48 h, at which time, the drug-containing 
medium was removed and the cells then allowed to recover in 
drug-free medium for a further 24 h.
Figure 2. Effect of NTX and LDN on a collection of proteins in HCT116 cells. Cells were treated with LDN (10 nM naltrexone) or NTX (10 µM naltrexone) 
for 24 h. Cells were then harvested by scraping and lysed in RIPA buffer for western blot analysis. Selection of the proteins was guided in part by the gene 
expression data. Blots are representative of three separate experiments, and the densitometry represents the mean and SDs of these expressed relative to the 
respective GAPDH loading control.
Figure 3. Effect of a drug-free period following culture with LDN or NTX. First the effect of a 72-h exposure to naltrexone was tested on a panel of cell lines 
and shown to be ineffectual at reducing cell numbers (A). A549 and HCT116 cells were then cultured with naltrexone at 1 nM, 10 nM, 1 µM and 10 µM. 
The first two concentrations were designated as LDN whilst the last two were conventional concentrations (NTX). After 48 h, media were aspirated and 
cells washed and re-cultured drug-free medium for a further 24 h. Parallel cultures were set up where cells were returned to drug-containing medium. MTT 
analysis (B) and cell counting using trypan-dye exclusion were performed on the cells (C - HCT116 alone). FACS analysis at 48 and 72 h were also done on 
HCT116 cells in an attempt to establish cell cycle distribution (D).

MTT assays showed significant reductions in the number 
of A549 and HCT116 cells remaining when a ‘recovery’ phase 
was adopted into the LDN treatment schedules (Fig. 3B). An 
initial culture with NTX did not result in such a dramatic 
reduction in cell number. Cell counting experiments in HCT116 
cells revealed that the reduction in cell number was associated 
with a fall in cell viability, which suggested an active cytotoxic 
response was achieved (Fig. 3C). Additional flow cytometric 
analysis of the cell cycle showed significant increases in the 
sub-G1 (apoptosis) peak following a LDN-then-recovery 
schedule with concomitant emptying of cells from G1 and G2. 
This was not as pronounced with NTX (Fig. 3D).
Priming cells with LDN enhances the activity of chemo-
therapy. Having shown that the pro-apoptotic proteins BAX 
and BAD were upregulated following treatment with LDN, we 
next tested the possibility that priming cells with LDN could 
sensitise cells to common chemotherapy drugs. We assessed 
this by developing treatment schedules that were made up of 
two separate treatment phases. The first would last 48 h and 
comprise no treatment or treatment with LDN. After this time, 
cells were removed from the drug, and the second phase of 
treatment would be added. This would also last 48 h, and be 
CPM, GEM or OXP. As a comparison, we also performed 
parallel experiments in which we used NTX in the first treat-
ment phase.
Results showed that in both cell lines studied, pre-culture 
with LDN followed by culture with any of the drugs always 
resulted in a greater reduction in cell number and viability 
when compared to the corresponding schedule that did 
not have the LDN pre-culture (Fig. 4). Conversely, in those 
schedules where cells were pre-cultured with standard NTX, 
treatment with any of the cytotoxic drugs did not generally 
result in dramatic reductions in cell number or viability 
(Fig. 4). Furthermore, comparing LDN-priming schedules 
with their respective NTX-primed ones showed significantly 
better cytotoxicity in the former schedules.
Discussion
Evidence of a role for naltrexone as an anticancer agent has 
been described in the literature for some time. Studies have 
highlighted an ability of this opioid antagonist to impede the 
rate and way that cancer cells grow, and that these anticancer 
action occur only at lower doses. However, the mechanism of 
this action has yet to be fully defined, and as such, the true 
value of this drug in the oncological setting has yet to be 
established in the clinical community. In an attempt to shed 
more light on this area, we have performed gene microarray 
studies to ascertain the means by which naltrexone can disrupt 
tumour cell growth. Additionally, we have compared the 
genetic fingerprint of tumour cells treated either with LDN or 
NTX to evaluate whether there is a divergence in the actions 
of the treatments. The significant finding of this study has been 
the categories of genes that are unique to LDN, which suggests 
that the mode of action differs between LDN and NTX.
In the early 1960s, it was reported that morphine possessed 
the capacity to disrupt the normal physiology of tumour-bearing 
rats (20). The study was undertaken primarily to explore the 
appetite-disruptive nature of morphine on animals bearing 
Figure 4. Effect of priming with LDN or NTX on A549 and HCT116 cells. Cells were cultured with 10 nM naltrexone (LDN) or 10 µM naltrexone (NTX) 
for 48 h before replacing the exhausted media with fresh media supplemented with cyclophosphamide (CPM, 100 µM for both cell lines), gemcitabine (GEM: 
0.5 µM for both cell lines) or oxaliplatin (OXP, 1 µM for both). Cells were allowed to grow for another 48 h before assessing cell number and viability. Columns

tumours; however, in addition to showing the morphine could 
reduce the body-weights of these animals, it was also noticed 
that their tumour-weights were concomitantly increased. The 
reason for this increase in tumour size was unclear, but it was 
perceivable that morphine could have had secondary effects 
on the immune system that supported tumour progression (21). 
Alternatively, the increases in tumour size could simply have 
been due to a direct effect of morphine that resulted in enhanced 
cellular proliferation in the tumours or reduced cell death. 
Indeed, morphine has been shown to prevent the normal cell 
death in the ciliary ganglion of the chick embryo, suggesting 
that in addition to modulating neurotransmission, it and other 
endogenous opiates may also regulate neurophysiology (22). 
The concentration of morphine appeared to be important in 
which effect it caused, as apoptosis in the chick embryo was 
only disrupted when used at the higher doses, whilst no effect 
was seen at the lower doses (6). Taken together, this suggested 
the possibility that drugs of this class could be used therapeuti-
cally to reduce tumour growth.
In fact, a similar growth-inhibitory action has been reported 
for the antagonist naltrexone, which also exhibits a similar 
dose-dependent quality (1). The mechanism by which it exerts 
its anticancer effect has yet to be fully elucidated, but a number 
of reports have indicated both direct-effects on tumour as well 
as indirect modifications to immune function, which enhances 
host immunity against tumours. Naltrexone has also been 
reported to elicit a number of other cellular responses that lead 
to reductions in tumours. Therefore, an agent that can alter 
survival and growth characteristics of cancer cells directly, 
whilst simultaneously promote an anticancer response by the 
immune system is attractive as a putative therapy (23).
In the first part of the study, we employed gene expres-
sion microarrays to identify the transcripts that were altered 
following culture with naltrexone. As previous studies, which 
included our own, acknowledged a possible divergence in 
effects dependent upon dose, we assessed and compared 
the effects of a low dose of naltrexone (LDN) with a more 
standard concentration (NTX). Although LDN and NTX are 
essentially the same drug, albeit at different concentrations, 
results showed approximately half of the genes that were 
altered following treatment with either were not the same. We 
thus focussed only on these, and surveyed the profile more 
carefully by using gene ontology. Results showed that the 
types of genes being downregulated by treatment were vari-
able, and no categories of genes emerged as being prevalent. 
In contrast, the categories of genes that were upregulated by 
treatment were associated with regulation of the cell cycle. 
To get a perspective of whether specific classes of genes were 
impacted upon by LDN and not NTX, we next focussed on the 
genes that were altered uniquely by LDN. Results showed that 
the common categories affected by LDN and not NTX were 
those involved with the cell cycle.
A typical response to cellular and/or DNA damage as a 
consequence of drug activity is to induce a cell cycle arrest 
that allows for the cell to decide a response (24). Typically, 
this arrest is transient and cells rapidly undergo repair or enter 
the apoptosis program. However, in some cases, this arrest 
persists, and the cells enter a protracted state of cytostasis (25), 
which can be inadvertently maintained by the presence of the 
drug. This paradoxically reduces the net sensitivity of the cell 
to the treatment. Cell death systems are intricately linked with 
those that regulate cell cycling, which means that the ability 
to perform one requires the ability to perform the other (26). 
Therefore, a protracted blockade in the cell cycle can minimise 
the ability of cells to undergo cell death.
Naltrexone has been described to exhibit a similar quality. 
One animal study from the 1980s reported the importance of the 
naltrexone dose in determining the overall antitumour effect. 
It was reported that, specifically for naltrexone, treatment in 
mice with a clinically conventional dose (10 mg/kg) induces 
a continuous occupancy of the opioid receptors, to which it 
is known to bind, which resulted in increased tumour growth 
(27). However, if doses were reduced to 1 or 0.1 mg/kg, the 
receptor blockade was thought to be incomplete, and binding 
sites remained open to ligands and thus activation of antitu-
mour processes.
Subsequent studies have also hinted at the importance of 
treatment schedule in determining efficacy, with intermittent 
administration of lower concentrations of naltrexone achieving 
the greatest antitumour response (28). Antagonistic blockade 
of the opioid receptors has been shown to result in a compen-
satory increase in their amounts. The immediate consequence 
of this would be a boost in receptors to which endogenous 
ligands such as the opioid growth factor (OGF) could bind. 
OGF binding would ultimately result in an inhibition of growth 
(1). This feedback-like benefit is lost if naltrexone was left in 
culture, as the continued presence of naltrexone occupies the 
de novo binding sites and out-compete OGF. Thus no growth-
inhibitory effect would be achieved.
Taken together, we hypothesised that adopting a recovery 
phase, during which time the cells would be devoid of drug, 
could result in improved efficacy. Results of the current 
experiments supported this, which showed that removing the 
cells from the culture medium containing LDN and allowing 
them to grow in drug-free medium significantly increased 
cell death. There are precedents for this; in fact, we have 
recently shown with other drugs that exhibit this protracted 
cell cycle blockade character that cell death can be enhanced 
by introducing a drug-free phase in the treatment schedule 
(16,19). These studies showed that drugs such as artemisinin 
and cannabidiol can elicit cell death in a number of cancer 
cells; however, in a number of these cases, their use has been 
associated with an absence of active cell killing. Instead, cells 
have arrested for much longer. Although the accompanying 
reduction in cell number is welcome, the lack of an active ‘cell 
killing’ reaction is not. One way around this is to include a 
drug-free phase, which can significantly enhance the cytotoxic 
nature of the treatments.
Our gene expression analysis also indicated a number of 
pro-apoptotic genes were upregulated by LDN. For example, 
the genes for bcl2-antagonist/killer 1 (BAK1) and the bcl2-
associated X protein (BAX) were both increased after treatment 
with LDN but not after NTX. This disparity in gene expression 
was recapitulated at the protein level, and offered the notion 
that treating tumour cells with LDN may prime cells to apop-
tosis (29). We therefore tested this by culturing cells with LDN 
before introducing them to a common cytotoxic drug. Results 
indicated the cytotoxic effects of the chemotherapies tested 
were significantly improved when cells were pre-treated with 
LDN, whilst pre-treatment with NTX did not result in such a

801
drastic response. Parenthetically, as the act of removing LDN 
could account for the increase in activity, paired t-test analysis 
were performed, which showed significant differences when 
comparing some of the schedules with the LDN:Un schedules.
The idea that LDN can prime a cancer cell to the effect of 
an ‘old-school’ cytotoxic drug is attractive (30), and presents 
a way that treatment regimens could be developed to exploit 
this potential mutualistic effect. Indeed, we have illustrated 
how the essence of combination therapy is to bring together 
drugs that have connected mechanisms of action, which 
when used together, generates an effect that surpasses what 
would have been achieved if the individual drugs were used 
separately (11). Improvements to outcome could equally be 
a consequence of a priming effect as seen in this study. It is 
also worthwhile noting that the drugs in the partnership do 
not need to be related, and one only has to induce an effect 
that sensitises the cell to the other drug. These combinations 
also usually involve a particular sequence of administration, 
with the priming drug given first. Our results thus suggest that 
LDN is a potential partner in drug-treatment regimens, and 
should be given upfront before common cytotoxic agents. The 
detailed molecular basis of this LDN-drug interaction needs to 
be fully assessed to ensure that the most appropriate combina-
tions are identified. Unlike many other drugs used in oncology, 
LDN is non-toxic and relatively cheap.
In conclusion, these data highlight the existence of a 
fundamental difference in the mechanism by which naltrexone 
elicits an effect. By using gene expression analysis, we showed 
there was a difference in the gene-fingerprint of the drug when 
used at two different concentration ranges. Specifically, LDN 
resulted in explicit changes to genes involved in cell cycle 
control, which were absent when doses were much higher. 
Further experimentation that was steered by the gene data 
revealed the efficacy of LDN to be enhanced by adaptations 
to treatment schedules. These improvements were linked to 
our attempts to negate a cell cycle and/or cell death blockade 
caused by the presence of the drug. Additionally, by utilising 
the priming effect of LDN, the cytotoxic effect of common 
chemotherapy drugs could be increased through the sequential 
administration of the drugs. Overall, these studies provide 
further evidence to support to role of LDN as an anticancer 
agent.
