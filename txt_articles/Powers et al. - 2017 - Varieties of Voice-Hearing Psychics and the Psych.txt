Hearing voices that are not present is a prominent symptom 
of serious mental illness. However, these experiences may be 
common in the non-help-seeking population, leading some 
to propose the existence of a continuum of psychosis from 
health to disease. Thus far, research on this continuum has 
focused on what is impaired in help-seeking groups. Here we 
focus on protective factors in non-help-seeking voice-hear-
ers. We introduce a new study population: clairaudient psy-
chics who receive daily auditory messages. We conducted 
phenomenological interviews with these subjects, as well as 
with patients diagnosed with a psychotic disorder who hear 
voices, people with a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder who 
do not hear voices, and matched control subjects (without 
voices or a diagnosis). We found the hallucinatory experi-
ences of psychic voice-hearers to be very similar to those of 
patients who were diagnosed. We employed techniques from 
forensic psychiatry to conclude that the psychics were not 
malingering. Critically, we found that this sample of non-
help-seeking voice hearers were able to control the onset 
and offset of their voices, that they were less distressed by 
their voice-hearing experiences and that, the first time they 
admitted to voice-hearing, the reception by others was much 
more likely to be positive. Patients had much more negative 
voice-hearing experiences, were more likely to receive a neg-
ative reaction when sharing their voices with others for the 
first time, and this was subsequently more disruptive to their 
social relationships. We predict that this sub-population of 
healthy voice-hearers may have much to teach us about the 
neurobiology, cognitive psychology and ultimately the treat-
ment of voices that are distressing.

Introduction
The positive symptoms of psychosis (hallucinations and 
delusions, amongst others) may be present in the general, 
non-help-seeking population.1–7 They may not be pathog-
nomonic of serious mental illness, but rather, there could 
be a continuum from milder attenuated forms to more 
severe.8 Such observations suggest a destigmatization of 
anomalous perceptions and beliefs.1 The impact of these 
observations on research practice has been extensive.2–7,9–12 
However, these observations have not yet changed clini-
cal practice.13 Indeed, some are skeptical whether they 
even can.13 There is considerable overlap between clini-
cal and nonclinical psychosis-like experiences,13 making 
it difficult to discern which warrant intervention and 
which do not.13 People with a diagnosed psychotic illness 
tend to be significantly more distressed by their atypical 
experiences than those who do not, despite similar assent, 
conviction, and preoccupation.11 However, this has yet 
to be converted into new therapeutic approaches.13 Here 
we consider what may protect nonclinical voice hearers, 
inspired by similar studies in addiction,14 oncology,15 and 
infectious diseases16,17: there are individuals who are resil-
ient despite similar exposure to risk factors as individuals 
who become ill.
We identify a new population—clairaudient psy-
chics—who report receiving auditory messages from 
other realms. Psychics have long concerned the American 
Society for Psychical Research and such luminaries as 
William James, Pierre Janet, and Wilhelm Wundt,18 
whose interests lay in testing the veracity of psychics’ 
claims. Just as we do not do this with our patients’ claims 
regarding the provenance of their voices, we are not inter-
ested in debunking the psychics. Rather, we study clairau-
dient psychics much as Garety and Peters studied druids 
to better understand the distinction between anomalous 
belief and delusion.11
Clairaudience, in the parlance of spiritualist commu-
nities, involves receiving auditory messages from spirits 
(as opposed to clairvoyance, which entails visions). We 
compared the phenomenology of voices in self-pro-
claimed clairaudient psychics to those of patients with a

psychotic illness who have auditory hallucinations. Good 
overlap could be grounds to conclude that these psychics 
are not malingering with regard to having voice-hearing 
experiences. Understanding the differences may provide 
insights into problematic voice-hearing.
Non-help-seeking voice-hearers have relatively intact 
verbal and executive functioning,19 though the neural cir-
cuitry engaged during voice hearing experiences appears 
to be broadly similar.20 Numerous studies have highlighted 
important differences in the emotional valence and 
content of voice experiences, as well as the explanatory 
schema evoked.21,22 Some individuals in these prior studies 
would, undoubtedly, describe themselves as clairaudient 
psychics. However, non-help-seeking voice hearers evoke 
a range of explanatory frameworks.21 Here, we focus, for 
the first time, on just 1 sub-group: clairaudient psychics. 
We aim to understand how and in what way their voices 
can be positive, life-affirming experiences.
Methods
Four groups of participants were recruited: (1) voice-hear-
ers with a diagnosable psychotic disorder (P+H+; n = 16); 
(2) voice-hearers without a diagnosable psychotic disor-
der (clairaudient psychics, P−H+; n = 17); (3) non-voice-
hearers with a diagnosable psychotic disorder (P+H−; 
n = 16); and (4) non-voice-hearers without a diagnosable 
psychotic disorder (P−H−; n = 18). Subjects were recruited 
via local advertisement and word of mouth. Some patients 
were referred to the study through their clinicians at the 
Connecticut Mental Health Center (CMHC). Clairaudient 
psychics were self-identified as such on websites and/or at 
local psychic meetings and were recruited through discus-
sions held at these meetings and referrals from other psy-
chics. All potential subjects were telephone screened. If 
they met inclusion criteria they were invited for an in-per-
son interview at the CMHC. Exclusion criteria for all par-
ticipants were as follows: (1) any neurological disorder or 
head trauma resulting in loss of consciousness or sustained 
deficits; (2) any recreational drug or alcohol use meet-
ing criteria for at-risk drinking (>2 drinks/d or 14 drinks/
wk for males, >1 drink/d or 7 drinks/wk for females) for 
1 month prior to enrollment; (3) left-handedness; and (4) 
self-reported abnormal hearing or vision. Voice-hearing 
participants had to report auditory hallucinations at least 
once per day. Non-voice-hearing participants must have 
had no voice-hearing experiences for at least 6 months 
prior to enrollment. Of the recruited non-voice-hearing 
participants with a diagnosable psychotic disorder, 69% 
(11/16) had no prior voice-hearing experiences. Of those 
who did, a mean of 8.0 years (±4.9, SD; min: 1 y, max: 15 y) 
had elapsed since their last voice-hearing experience, most 
of which (4/5) were reported to have occurred in the time 
surrounding their first psychotic episode. Non-treatment-
seeking voice-hearers were required to be antipsychotic-
naive and not in treatment of any psychiatric issue, and 
upon further screening could not have a diagnosable Axis 
I disorder; no participants were excluded after interview 
for this reason. Healthy control participants also had no 
diagnosable Axis I disorder.
All participants had the opportunity to read and dis-
cuss the consent form. All gave written informed consent 
before participating. All procedures were approved by 
the Yale University Human Investigations Committee. 
Participants completed a series of pen-and-paper ques-
tionnaires and underwent a semi-structured interview, 
including standard psychiatric ratings scales. Some partic-
ipants went on to participate in a functional neuroimaging 
study (data reported elsewhere). Here we report findings 
from the following questionnaires and rating scales:
1.Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)23: to 
assess for and quantify positive and negative psychotic 
symptoms in both help-seeking and non-help-seeking 
populations.
2.Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-4 (SCID) Axis 
I Disorders24 and Axis II Disorders25: to detect the pres-
ence of a diagnosable psychiatric condition and admin-
istered by a trained psychiatrist (ARP).
3.Launay-Slade 
Hallucinations 
Scale-Revised 
(LSHS-R)10,26: 
to quantify hallucination severity in clinical and non-
clinical groups.
4.Auditory Hallucinations Rating Scale (AHRS)27: to 
quantify hallucination severity, with additional key 
elements (distress, frequency, and preoccupation) not 
covered by the LSHS.
5.Beliefs About Voices Questionnaire-Revised (BA
VQ-R)28: 
to assess for beliefs about voice identities and engage-
ment. BA
VQ-R scores are related to voice-induced 
distress.29
6.Peters et al Delusions Inventory (PDI)30: to assess 
endorsement, conviction, preoccupation, and distress 
for a range of unusual beliefs.
7.Brief Multidimensional Measurement of Religiosity and 
Spirituality (BMMRS)31 to quantify religious/spiritual 
engagement, given psychics’ identification as members 
of a spiritual community.
We also administered the computerized binary scale of 
auditory speech hallucinations (cbSASH)32 as a semi-
structured, in-person interview with a focus on malinger-
ing about voices,33–35 a concern in the psychics. A subset of 
participants (P−H+ n = 16; P+H+ n = 13) also described 
their earliest experiences with hearing voices and sharing 
those experiences with others.
All analyses were conducted in Matlab version 2014b. 
Group differences in endorsement of categorical variables 
(table 2, supplementary table 1) were assessed via chi-square 
tests with Holm-Sidak36 correction for multiple compari-
sons. Holm-Sidak correction was also used in comparing 
the results of specific voice-hearing scales between the 2 
voice-hearing groups (table 3). When Holm-Sidak correc-
tion could not be used because of multiple P values per

Results
Baseline Demographic and Clinical Characteristics
Baseline characteristics of participants are summarized 
in table 1. SCID-I diagnoses for the P+H+ and P+H− 
groups included schizoaffective disorder (n = 9) and 
schizophrenia (n = 9). All groups included a subset who 
reported a major depressive episode (MDE) in the past, 
as well as alcohol and other drug use, currently in remis-
sion, but this did not differ significantly across groups 
(P = .15). Age, sex, race, years of education, and estimated 
full-scale IQ did not differ significantly. Participants with-
out a diagnosed psychotic disorder were more likely to be 
employed than those who did not. Antipsychotic burden 
did not differ between the 2 diagnosed groups.
Analysis of Acoustic Characteristics, Content, 
Frequency, Affective Response, and Interpretation 
of Voices
We conducted a comprehensive, in-person semi-structured 
interview in order to compare the 2 hallucinating groups 
across a variety of voice-hearing experiences (table 2). 
Voice characteristics, derived from the cbSASH32 and 
other phenomenological surveys,33–35 were grouped into 
themes: items assessing low-level voice characteristics,

content of utterance, frequency of utterance, and higher-
level considerations of the voice-hearer’s interaction with 
their voices, affective response, and beliefs about the 
nature of their voices. The 2 voice-hearing groups did 
not differ on nearly any acoustic characteristics of their 
voices, including endorsement of voices that sounded 
clear (“like external speech”), although the P−H+ group 
did differ in their likelihood of also endorsing voices that 
were deep (“like thinking in words”). Importantly, several 
items (end of Low-Level Acoustic Characteristics section 
of table 2) are extremely rare in voice-hearing patients 
and may signify atypical or malingered voices.34,35 No 
participants in either group endorsed these characteris-
tics. Similarly, the content and frequency of voices did 
not differ between voice-hearing groups.
By contrast, the 2 voice-hearing groups interacted dif-
ferently with their voices, they inferred different origins 
for their voices, and had different affective responses 
to them. The 2 groups similarly endorsed voices that 
occurred spontaneously (in situations both in and outside 
of their spiritual practice), but the P−H+ group was more 
likely report that they could make the voices occur by will 
and prevent them from occurring (corrected P = .049). 
The psychics were more likely to identify a divine being 
as the voice source (corrected P = .018). They were also 
more likely to say their voices were protective (P = .040), 
and less likely to describe them as bothersome (P = .010).
More fine-grained examination of voice-hearing 
experiences was conducted with the use of the AHRS27 
and the BAVQ-R28 (table 3). Although groups were spe-
cifically selected to have had at least daily hallucinatory 
experiences, frequency did differ between groups, with P−
H+ participants reporting voices occurring between once 
and 10 times daily, whereas those in the P+H+ group 
reported voices 3–6 times per hour on average (corrected 
P = .029). P+H+ participants rated their voices as some-
times producing significant fear or anxiety, whereas all P−
H+ participants rated their voice-hearing experiences at 
the lowest distress rating, “Not distressing, may be enjoy-
able.” Consistent with this difference, P+H+ participants 
had higher malevolence scores on the BAVQ (corrected 
P = .008) and were more likely than P−H+ participants 
to resist their voices (behavioral resistance score, cor-
rected P < .0001; emotional resistance score, corrected 
P = .0001). By contrast, P−H+ participants were more 
likely to characterize their voices as benevolent and were 
more likely to engage with them emotionally (corrected P 
< .0001) and behaviorally (corrected P = .0002).
Overall Symptomatology
In order to determine how the clairaudient psychic group 
compared to the other 3 groups in terms of overall symp-
tomatology and religious conviction, we compared: the 
LSHS-R10,26; PANSS23; Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale 
(BPRS)37; Peters Delusion Inventory (PDI)30; Chapman 
Anhedonia, 
Perceptual 
Aberration, 
and 
Magical 
Ideation subscales38; and the Brief Multidimensional 
Measurement of Religiosity and Spirituality (BMMRS)31 
scores across all 4 groups (supplementary table 1).
Both hallucinating groups had similar scores on the 
LSHS and did not differ on Auditory Hallucinations 
(AH), Vivid Daydreams (VDD), Vivid Thoughts (VT), 
or Intrusive Thoughts (IT) subscales. Interestingly, P−
H+ participants exhibited higher scores on the visual hal-
lucinations subset of the LSHS.
There was a significant main effect of hallucina-
tion status and psychotic status on total PANSS scores, 
PANSS positive symptom scores, and PANSS general 
symptom scores. A main effect of psychotic status but 
not hallucination status was seen on PANSS negative 
symptom scores. Analysis of PANSS hallucinations score 
(P3 ratings) revealed the expected main effect of halluci-
nation status with no main effect of psychotic status or 
interaction effects. Analysis of delusion scores (P1 rat-
ings) demonstrated main effects of hallucination status 
and psychotic status as well as interaction effects. Post 
hoc analysis demonstrated significantly greater P1 ratings 
in P−H+ and P+H− groups than P−H− groups. A simi-
lar pattern was observed in other measures of unusual 
thought, including BPRS Unusual Thoughts scores, PDI 
total score, and number of delusional ideas endorsed 
on PDI.
We also examined spiritual/religious conviction across 
groups. Few differences in religious experience were 
found among the groups. Main effects of hallucination 
status were found in daily experiences and religious cop-
ing. Interaction effects were also found in tendency to use 
religious support for coping, with post hoc tests revealing 
a higher tendency of P+H+ participants to use religious 
support to cope with stress than their P−H+ counterparts, 
who had the lowest tendency to utilize these resources.
Measures of schizotypy were additionally different 
between hallucinating groups. Significant main effects of 
hallucination status were seen in total and magical ide-
ation score on the Chapman scales. Interestingly, P−H+ 
group members had the highest magical ideation (higher 
than either diagnosed group).
On SCID-II screening (supplementary table 2), P−H+ 
participants screened positive for Schizotypal Personality 
Disorder at a rate of 94%, much higher than any other 
group tested. By contrast, P+H+ were more likely 
than any other group to screen positive for Borderline 
Personality Disorder (BPD) (60%).
Early Voice-Hearing Experiences and Social Support
Retrospective estimates of age at first voice were obtained 
and participants rated how positively these experiences 
were received within their social networks (figure 1). Age 
at first voice differed markedly between the 2 groups (fig-
ure 1a). P+H+ reported being an average of 22.9 years

old when they heard their first voice, compared to 
7.5 years of age in the psychic group (P = .0002). Patients 
reported significantly higher rates of negative and neu-
tral experiences initially telling others about their voice-
hearing, and psychics reported more positive experiences 
(figure 1b; by chi-squared test, P = .0074).
Two-way ANOVA (figure 1c) with factors psychotic 
diagnosis and valence of early experiences talking 
about their voices confirmed a significant main effect 
of psychotic diagnosis (mean age, P+ = 22.9, P− = 7.4; 
P = .005) and significant interaction effects (P = .049); 
the main effect of valence exhibited a trend toward sig-
nificance (P = .088). Post hoc t tests revealed a significant 
difference in age between the 2 groups among those who 
stated they had negative initial experiences revealing that 
they heard voices (P = .022); no other valence categories 
demonstrated significant inter-group differences.
Discussion
The voice-hearing experiences of clairaudient psychics 
exhibit striking similarities and important differences 
from help-seeking voice-hearers. There were very few 
differences in the low-level acoustic characteristics, con-
tent, or frequency of their experiences. There were key 
differences in their interpretations of these events, their 
affective response to them, and their perceived ability to 
control them. Lastly, investigation into participants’ early 
voice-hearing experiences revealed a younger age of onset 
in psychics compared to their treatment-seeking counter-
parts, with accompanying positive experiences on telling 
others of their voice-hearing.
To our knowledge, this is the first description of self-
identified psychics as a voice-hearing population with-
out the need for psychiatric care. Like their voice-hearing 
counterparts in the general population, our group of psy-
chics exhibited broadly similar phenomenological features 
to treatment-seeking voice-hearers.8,22,39 Frequency of 
voice-hearing was slightly lower than those seeking treat-
ment, again consistent with prior reports.22 Psychics identi-
fied their voices as benevolent, also consistent with prior 
work.40 The decreased distress related to voice-hearing may 
be crucial to psychics’ avoiding a need for care.3,41 Psychics’ 
age of onset was lower, again similarly to prior reports in 
non-treatment-seeking voice-hearers.22,42 Perhaps most 
notably, like other reports,40 clairaudient psychics reported 
being able to control voice onset and offset.
Despite these similarities, there are some key differences 
between the psychics’ experiences and prior descriptions 
of nonclinical voice-hearing. Most notably, the psychics 
report ongoing daily voices, whereas other nonclinical voice 
hearing is often transient and context-dependent.2 Rather 
than being passive receivers of verbal information, clairau-
dient psychics seek it out as a part of their daily activities. 
Indeed, many of those interviewed report an increased 
perceived ability to control the occurrence of their voices 
and—crucially—report that they had not always possessed 
such an ability, instead developing it over time. Rather 
than reflecting enhanced executive function and cognitive 
control, as some have suggested,8,43,44 this may instead be 
the result of intentional practice. This, in turn, may result 
from the lower distress exhibited by the psychics, leading 
to an increased willingness to engage with and ultimately 
control them. This is consistent with a recovery-oriented 
understanding of voice-hearing.45 Indeed, a similar ability 
to control voice-hearing was first reported by Romme and 
Escher in their survey of non-help-seeking voice-hearers.21 
Furthermore, anthropological studies of voice-hearing in 
small face-to-face societies found that shamans, spiritual 
practitioners who work for the good of the group by chan-
neling metaphysical powers, also maintained a degree of 
control over their experiences.46 Murphy’s classic analysis 
of psychosis in culturally different settings observed that 
the psychotic person’s lack of control over his unusual

experience was an important part of what identified him 
as mad to his social world.47 Taken together with our data, 
these earlier observations, and the growing Hearing Voices 
Movement, proffer the exciting possibility that such con-
trol could be trained, opening a new therapeutic avenue for 
voices that are distressing.
Psychics were more likely to engage with their voices 
and less likely to rely on religiously-based coping strat-
egies than those in the treatment-seeking group, likely 
denoting a decreased need for coping in general. Here 
we emphasize the distinction between religiosity (a belief 
in God or gods, to be worshiped often by engaging in 
rituals) vs spirituality (a worldview that focuses on tran-
scending what is physically explicable). One can be more 
religious and less spiritual (to a point) and vice versa.48 
While the psychics were more spiritual and less religious, 
the help-seeking group were significantly more religious. 
We suggest that one source of support for help-seekers 
is the church, a physical location and social group who 
can be depended upon for support and a set of practices 
that provide meaning.49 In contrast, the psychics had a 
metaphysical account of their voices, less constrained by 
doctrine and therefore, perhaps more accommodating of 
their specific circumstances and experiences. This group 
may have relied less on communal organization because 
of their differences in belief, although it should be noted 
that some psychics did have spiritual organizations to 
which they belonged in which they often found comfort 
(see individual quotations in table 4 for instances of this). 
This will be an important point for future investigation, 
especially given that religiosity and spirituality can, for 
some people, signify a barrier to medication adherence 
and may be a source of both help and difficulty.50
The psychics exhibited higher schizotypy than the other 
groups, while treatment-seeking voice-hearers exhibited 
more traits of BPD. These traits do not necessarily indi-
cate the presence of BPD (as they may be explained by 
the presence of an Axis I disorder). They are primarily 
markers of social impairment. Hoffman emphasized that 
psychotic symptoms develop in social isolation,51 and that 
voices are perceived as social agents communicating with 
the experient.52 Perhaps our observation of Borderline 
symptomatology in the P+H+ group attests to the social 
difficulties that hearing distressing voices can portend.
While the group differences described above survive cor-
rection for multiple comparisons, several others did not. 
Given the descriptive nature of our study, these items are 
nonetheless worth noting. Help-seeking voice-hearers 
appear to have multisensory hallucinations at a rate simi-
lar to that previously described,53 while psychics reported a 
higher rate. However, it is difficult to say whether the hallu-
cinations were truly fused, a rarer phenomenon than sim-
ple multisensory hallucinations.54 The increased likelihood 
that help-seeking voice-hearers’ voices would replay things 
they have spoken or thought may reflect the unpleasant 
nature of their experiences, and although no participants 
met criteria for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), 
could speak to the possibility of past trauma in the help-
seeking group.55 We note that the help-seeking voice-
hearers were more likely to screen positive for BPD than 
psychics or non-voice-hearing help-seekers. BPD involves 
social dysfunction and is associated with developmental 
trauma and neglect, in which voices and dissociative expe-
riences are common,56 and wherein voices are similar to 
those experienced by patients with schizophrenia.57
Other items that did not survive correction may reflect 
aspects of the illness narrative: treatment-seeking voice-
hearers were more likely to ascribe voices to themselves, 
more likely to say they were the result of brain processes, 
and less likely to call them comforting. In order to more 
fully illustrate the similarities and differences between the 
psychic group and their treatment-seeking counterparts, 
we include representative quotations regarding voice-
hearing experiences (table 4).
As figure 1 shows, those who had positive experiences 
telling another person about their voices, regardless of 
treatment-seeking status, tended to have had an earlier age 
of onset than those who had negative experiences. Indeed, 
although the overall differences in age of onset may indi-
cate that psychics represent a biologically distinct subset 
of voice-hearers that does not follow the typical trajec-
tory of psychotic illness, the interaction between these 
factors may indicate that social factors (such as the age at 
which one describes voice-hearing to friends and relatives, 
which may be inversely related to their acceptance of these 
claims) may represent an important mediating prognostic 
factor. This is speculative, of course, and we note that we 
do not know whether the patients’ trajectories would have 
been any different had they been more accepted by those 
around them. Differences in family culture may also prove 
to be an important factor. It will be important to establish 
whether voice-hearers’ spiritual beliefs predate their voice-
hearing experiences in subsequent studies.
Our study carries some limitations. First, the sample 
is very small compared to studies that used popula-
tion-based approaches to nonclinical voice-hearing,58,59 
although we replicated many of the findings typical of 
voice-hearing in those studies. Nevertheless, other differ-
ences may arise in a larger sample and interesting sub-
groups may be identified. Second, our results may have 
been influenced by our choice of assessments. Other 
scales may have elicited other aspects of individuals’ 
experiences. Similarly, demand characteristics specifically 
related to participants’ professional identities as psychics 
could be addressed in future. Lastly, concerns about the 
stability of so-called “healthy” voice-hearing groups has 
been raised recently.60 For this reason, efforts should be 
made to follow this unique cohort over time to determine 
the stability of their experiences and functioning.
We neither confirm nor deny the veracity of psychics’ 
beliefs regarding their experiences; instead, we study 
their voice-hearing as a crucial counterpart to clinical

[Researcher: Where in space do they sound like they’re coming from?...] More often, 
it’s either from within my body or right to the right side of my head [Researcher: 
Within your head? Or within other parts of your body?] Within my head.
[Researcher: Anything make [the voices] less frequent?] If I’m really worried about 
something, really preoccupied with something in my own life, not sleeping, caffeine, that 
kind of thing, I’m more likely to block them out.
[Researcher: Is it mostly words, sentences or whole conversations?] It’s mostly 
words and sentences. Very rarely whole conversations.
[Researcher: Do they affect your safety?] I have gotten voices that calm me down…When 
I was in a car accident once and they said everything was going to be okay.
[Researcher: Do you do anything to control them besides shutting yourself off?] 
Yes, sometimes I will sing. I will play a song in my head so that I hear a song and 
not them.
[Researcher: Any environmental things that make them more likely...?] I would 
say white noise or anytime I’m not really focused on anything so maybe when I’m 
driving and not really focusing or zoning out
I try not to listen to the T.V
. or radio for [personal communications]… I’m very 
religious… my husband was the president of his church… I try not to… but if 
I really focus on it I can.
[Researcher: When do [the voices] happen?] If I allow it, it can happen all the time.
Sometimes I can put a wall up, but if its meant to be heard or seen, it will be.
The voices don’t cause anxiety because I’ve trained myself.
[Researcher: Have you ever heard the devil?] Yes. I’ve heard the devil and the Angel 
of Death. [Researcher: In the past [have you] heard the voice of God speaking?] 
Yes, all the time!
[Researcher: is that typical of the length [of the voices]?] yes, now I can get 
sentences. When I was younger, I only really got words but now sentences.
I’ve done a lot of meditation techniques to just make sure that the voices are clear so that 
I can understand the message.
[Researcher: As far as the acoustic qualities...?] As clear as your voice or as clear  
as my voice
You said to me, “You’re amazing” and then I heard a small voice say, “Yes, you truly 
are.”...As clear as day. For me, it was a validation.
My Husband’s voice is always with me... And it would be something like “Don’t 
forget to take your pills” [Researcher: And that was from outside of you] Yes, he 
would tell me like routine things. the routine kind of continued even though my 
husband wasn’t there.
[Researcher: Can you make it happen?] Yeah, when you’re open it will come. But it takes work.
[Researcher: In terms of how real [the voices] sound...] Very real...I think depending 
on the messages and how in tune you are. Sometimes they can just be jibberish and 
in the background and sometimes they can be really intense. [Researcher: You hear 
jibberish sometimes?] Yes, but it’s rare. They’re usually pretty intense.
[Researcher: Do [the voices] ever come when you don’t want it to come?] It always 
comes when you don’t want it to come; you don’t expect it. [Researcher: Can you 
stop it?] You can’t stop it. [Researcher: Can you call it?]I can not want to deal with 
it and it will come later on. [Researcher: Like, postpone it?] Yeah, I can postpone it 
but I can’t stop it.

It was later on in life... I was like 5 when my mom told me that what I was doing 
was wrong and I was making things up and I didn’t need to talk about things 
because people would think I was crazy and stuff.
[Researcher: [Have you] ever been troubled by hearing voices in your head?] No, it doesn’t 
really faze me.
I can turn it off, but it more often sounds like a cocktail party when I shut myself 
off to them.
These voices are my spirit guides. They come from heaven. They’re departed loved ones.
[Researcher: Sounds like they happen in episodes...] I would never quantify that by saying 
it’s an “episode” at all. There are times when I don’t want to communicate or I’m dealing 
with something in my earthly life that I just don’t... I tune it out. I am not in constant 
communication 24/7
I can’t make them communicate with me but I can make myself open to hearing...
I used to hear so big that I couldn’t function...I would pray and ask for help 
but it was so big that there was no help and I couldn’t function just from all the 
overwhelming noise.
I learned to ask God to hear everything out-loud and eventually I learned to ask one 
spokesperson to step forward and talk to me one at a time.
I have a very special relationship with Archangel Michael. He was my imaginary 
friend when I was a kid, but he wasn’t imaginary. I just didn’t know his name was 
Michael until he told me way later… after reading the Bible or someone saying 
something or something.
[Researcher: Do you hear conversations?] Oh yeah [they talk to each other.] It’s 
just like walking through a cafeteria
When I’m “on” [the number of voices] can be relentless. [Researcher: And for days 
off?] When I’m off, I can run into some situation and it’s there, like it’s so strong 
that I have to do whatever it says.
I can turn things on and turn things off. When I’m working, i open myself and when I’m 
not, i turn it off, like a switch.
It can happen two, three times a day [when I’m “off”] spontaneously.
[Researcher: Do you ever get any personal communications from the radio 
or television?] Every now and then... Like if there’s an energy that wants to 
communicate but I have the walls up because I don’t want to deal with this... 
[Researcher: what happens then?] Lets say the screen will get fuzzy and there’s no 
reason and then you’ll hear through the fuzz... when you shut [the voices] off and 
they’re like “No, I want to talk to you.”
I’m not scared to hear [a voice] but certain voices are troubling.
My phone is weird because I’ll shut everything off and my phone will be like 
“Nope, you’re not going to shut down on me.” There’s no reason for it. Anything 
battery or electric they can manipulate.
That noise [from the voices] becomes padded but it’s there...but you’re shutting it away. 
You’re like, “I don’t want to hear that” so you’re padding it. [Researcher: Because you’re 
attending to other things?] Exactly. [Researcher: But it’s still there? So there’s chatter now?] 
It’s off. [So is it still there or are you just not paying attention to it?] I close the wall. It’s 
almost like there’s a wall and I put the wall up. I taught myself to do this when I was five...
because my mother just shut me down [when I tried to talk about my experiences].
When you sleep, you’re out of your body and a lot of times they try to talk to you 
when you’re sleeping.
You train yourself. You just shut it off...But I can’t make them disappear. They’re like 
muffled.

When I was six, I remember sitting outside by myself and having conversations with 
something...I thought it was the wind [that I was conversing with], and just hearing 
the voices, which I was comfortable with... Then there were other times when 
I would be sent to my room and it was dark and I was being punished and there 
would be occasional voices that would freak me out.
[Researcher: Are they episodic or do they happen constantly?] They’re not constant. I can 
shut them off.
There would be moments where I would be in kind of a quiet contemplative state, 
so like I would be cooking a meal and making a recipe and then I would just 
hear... Sometimes it was like... A lot of chatter, so like a cocktail party and you’re 
just hearing the overtones of everybody. But there would be a feeling of like I don’t 
like... if I could make out what they were saying, I would have a feeling that I don’t 
like that because it’s not pleasant to me.
[Researcher: What do you do to shut them down?] I tell them to shut up. [That’s all you 
do? Just internal, you just tell them to shut up?] No, I say it out loud...”I’m off duty now. 
Go away.”
There would be moments when the voices would egg me on... Egg my anger on 
and it would be like “go break something” or “go hit your brother” or go do 
something like that… a lot of it was more of a self-loathing thing, so I would hear 
“you’re stupid” or things like that.
When I was a kid we used to joke that there were voices in the fan.
I don’t think I was troubled by it...it was like “Okay, what’s the deal?” and I wanted to 
understand it. But I always had a sense of reassurance...I never felt like I had to worry for 
hearing voices in my head.
[What was your first experience hearing a voice?] I don’t remember a time, but I do 
remember as I got older--closer to my teen years--where I would be upset and it 
would be like this other person talking to me. I would be like “I’m going freaking 
crazy”.
Other times I miss it. I’m like, “where are my friends?” [Researcher: Can you turn it back 
on then?] Yeah, if there’s something I want to know personally I can.
“I was troubled until I learned what it was.”
[Researcher: You were getting verbal messages [during your early experiences]?] It 
would be verbal messages, but it would be more bodily sensations...it turned out to be 
this mediumship thing. [Researcher: So you started finding meaning in these somatic 
sensations?] Exactly...it wouldn’t scare me anymore and now I work enough of the 
energies that I can be like “Bro, back up.”
I was [younger] and would be like “I am going to be nothing when I grow up,” and 
they would be like, “No, you’re going to be a writer and you’re going to help people.”...
[Researcher: So your first experience with voices was reassuring?] They were talking to me 
positively... trying to keep me from being like, “I suck.”

very comforted and felt not alone in a positive way

been troubled...That’s not true. I’ll say a 2 [on a scale of five] because I was, but

[One of my voices] was a female French scientist...and that was the powerful female, 
smart female presence that I needed. Having a female scientist who came to me was...very 
empowering.
At that point, I was going absolutely crazy trying to figure out what is wrong with 
me: why am I hearing all of these things? I really feel nuts. How do I fix this?
I... fumbled through life for a while with this whole hearing [voices] and “knowing” 
[clairsentience] and “seeing” [clairvoyance] and then a friend of mine...was like, “You have 
to go to this center because there are people like you! You have a gift and you need to go!” 
And since then, it has been wonderful. Understanding how to dissect it...being able to

it wasn’t a person, it was an alien. The alien was speaking to me but I couldn’t 
understand and my guide had to translate to me.
[Spirits talking to me is] part of being “on” all the time, which I do like, but there are 
boundaries and I have to set them. [Researcher: So you’re ignoring them.] No, I’m not 
ignoring them…I’m just like, “No, not right now.”
[Researcher: In terms of where they sound like they’re coming from ...] Sometimes 
it will be from far away. Most of the time it’s like they’re right here...90% of the 
time they’re right here.
[Researcher: Can you make them happen by will?] By my passions, I’m making 
them more inclined to happen, but they happen when they happen.
[Researcher: [Have you] ever been troubled by hearing voices in your head?] No, I’ve never 
been troubled by it.
My first big master was the Roman Emperor Julian the apostate.
[Researcher: [Have you] ever been troubled by hearing voices in your head?] I’ve never 
been troubled... Because I can control it.
[Researcher: When you first heard a voice, what was that? How old were you?] 14. [Do you 
remember what it was like?] Uplifting. Astral projecting. Loving. Protective.
I used to hear voices a lot. What happened was I started to develop a psychic 
sense. I would hear a cacophony of voices. I would try to go to sleep and I could 
hear conversations and I would hear the doorbell ring and then five minutes later it 
would ring and I could hear people knocking....it bothered me because I couldn’t 
sort it out. I was too open, if that makes sense.
[How old were you when you first heard a voice?] I was around 5 or 7. [Was it a pleasant 
or unpleasant experience?] It was nurturing. It was effeminate in nature. You might equate 
it to some kind of benevolent guide.

voice-hearing—one free, eg, from the stigma of diagnosis 
and the complications of treatment. We cannot conclude 
that all clairaudient psychics have similar voice-hearing 
experiences to treatment-seeking voice-hearers or that all 
psychics’ claims of voice-hearing are veridical. Indeed, 
we acknowledge that we likely created a selection bias—
those who have veridical voice-hearing may be more 
likely to participate. However, this homogeneous group 
of voice-hearers (who share a similar explanatory frame-
work) may facilitate the identification of protective fac-
tors undetected in more heterogeneous, population-based 
samples. These factors could guide the development of 
treatment strategies for voices that are distressing.
