Identifying asymptomatic older individuals at elevated
risk for developing Alzheimer disease (AD) is of clinical
importance. Among 1,081 asymptomatic older adults,
a recently validated polygenic hazard score (PHS) sig-
nificantly predicted time to AD dementia and steeper
longitudinal cognitive decline, even after controlling
for APOE E4 carrier status. Older individuals in the
highest PHS percentiles showed the highest AD inci-
dence rates. PHS predicted longitudinal clinical decline
among older individuals with moderate to high Con-
sortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease
(amyloid) and Braak (tau) scores at autopsy, even
among APOE E4 noncarriers. Beyond APOE, PHS may
help identify asymptomatic individuals at highest risk
for developing Alzheimer neurodegeneration.

symptoms.1,2
Identification
of
cognitively
asymptomatic older adults at elevated risk for AD
dementia (ie, those with preclinical AD) would aid in
evaluation of new AD therapies.2 Genetic information,
such as presence of the E4 allele of apolipoprotein E
(APOE), can help identify individuals who are at higher
risk for AD dementia.3 Longitudinal studies have found
that APOE E4 status predicts decline to mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) and dementia,4 and steeper cognitive
decline in cognitively normal individuals.5
Beyond APOE E4 carrier status, recent genetic stud-
ies have identified numerous single nucleotide polymor-
phisms (SNPs), each of which is associated with a small
increase in AD dementia risk.6 Using genome-wide asso-
ciation studies (GWAS) from AD cases and controls, we
have recently developed a novel polygenic hazard score
(PHS) for predicting age-specific risk for AD dementia
that integrates 31 AD-associated SNPs (in addition to
APOE) with U.S. population-based AD dementia inci-
dence rates.7 Among asymptomatic older adults, in retro-
spective analyses, we have previously shown that the
PHS-predicted age of AD onset strongly correlates with
the actual age of onset.7 To evaluate clinical usefulness
and further validate PHS, in this study, we prospectively
evaluated whether PHS predicts rate of progression to
AD dementia and longitudinal cognitive decline in cog-
nitively asymptomatic older adults and individuals with
MCI.
Subjects and Methods
We evaluated longitudinal clinical and neuropsychological data
(from March 2016) from the National Alzheimer’s Coordinat-
ing Center (NACC).8 Using the NACC uniform dataset, we
focused on older individuals classified at baseline as cognitively
normal (CN), with a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)9 of 0
and available genetic information (n 5 1,081, Table). We also

 evaluated older individuals classified at baseline as MCI (CDR
5 0.5) with available genetic information (n 5 571, see Table).
We focused on CN and MCI individuals with age of AD
dementia onset < 88 years to avoid violations of Cox propor-
tional hazards assumption as evaluated using scaled Schoenfeld
residuals (total n 5 1,652). The institutional review boards of
all participating institutions approved the procedures for all Alz-
heimer’s Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) and National
Institute on Aging Alzheimer’s Disease Center substudies. Writ-
ten informed consent was obtained from all participants or
surrogates.
For each CN and MCI participant in this study, we cal-
culated their individual PHS, as previously described.7 In brief,
we identified AD-associated SNPs (at p < 1025) using geno-
type data from 17,008 AD cases and 37,154 controls from
Stage 1 of the International Genomics of Alzheimer’s Disease
Project. Next, we selected a final total of 31 SNPs based on a
stepwise Cox proportional hazards model using genotype data
from 6,409 AD patients and 9,386 older controls from Phase 1
of the ADGC. We corrected the resulting scores for each indi-
vidual for the baseline allele frequencies using European geno-
types from 1000 Genomes Project to derive a PHS for each
participant. Finally, by combining U.S. population-based inci-
dence rates and genotype-derived PHS for each individual, we
derived estimates of instantaneous risk for developing AD,
based on genotype and age. In this study, the PHS computed
for every CN and MCI participant represents the vector prod-
uct of an individual’s genotype for the 31 SNPs and the corre-
sponding parameter estimates from the ADGC Phase 1 Cox
proportional hazard model in addition to the APOE effects (for
additional details see Desikan et al7).
We first investigated the effects of the PHS on progression
to AD dementia by using a Cox proportional hazards model,
with time to event indicated by age of AD dementia onset. We
resolved “ties” using the Breslow method. We covaried for effects
of sex, APOE E4 status (binarized as having at least 1 E4 allele vs
none), education, and age at baseline. To prevent violating the
proportional hazards assumptions, we additionally included base-
line age stratified by quintiles as a covariate.10
Next, we employed a linear mixed-effects (LME) model
to evaluate the relationship between PHS and longitudinal clin-
ical decline as assessed by change in CDR Sum of Boxes
(CDR-SB) as well as by change in Logical Memory Test,
Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale–Revised (WAIS-R) Digit
Symbol, Boston Naming Test (BNT), Trail-Making Tests A and
B (TMTA/B), and forward and backward Digit Span Test
(f/bDST). To maintain consistent directionality across all tests,
we inverted the scale for Trail-Making tests such that lower
scores represent decline. We covaried for sex, APOE E4 status,
education, baseline age, and all their respective interactions
with time. We were specifically interested in the PHS 3 time
interaction, whereby a significant interaction indicates differ-
ences in rates of decline, as a function of differences in PHS.
We then examined the main effect of PHS by comparing slopes
of cognitive decline over time in the neuropsychological tests
for individuals with high (�84 percentile) and low PHS (�16
percentile), defined by 1 standard deviation above or below the
mean of PHS, respectively.11 We also compared goodness of fit
between the LME models with and without PHS using likeli-
hood ratio tests to determine whether PHS LME models
resulted in a better fit than non-PHS LME models.
Finally, we evaluated the relationship between PHS,
APOE, and neuropathology in preclinical AD. Specifically, we
conducted
LME
analysis
assessing
longitudinal
change
in
CDR-SB in CN individuals with available neuropathology (spe-
cifically, neuritic plaque scores based on the Consortium to
Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease [CERAD] and neu-
rofibrillary tangle scores assessed with Braak stages).
Results
PHS significantly predicted risk of progression from CN
to AD dementia (hazard ratio [HR] 5 2.36, 95% confi-
dence interval [CI] 5 1.38–4.03, p 5 1.66 3 1023),
illustrating that polygenic information beyond APOE E4
can identify asymptomatic older individuals at greatest
risk for developing AD dementia. Individuals in the
highest PHS decile had the highest annualized AD

 incidence rates (Fig 1). PHS also significantly influenced
risk of progression to AD dementia in MCI individuals
(HR 5 1.17, 95% CI 5 1.02–1.35, p 5 2.36 3 1022).
Using the combined CN and MCI cohorts (total n 5
1,652) to maximize statistical power, we found that PHS
significantly predicted risk of progression from CN and
MCI to AD dementia (HR 5 1.31, 95% CI 5 1.14–
1.51, p 5 1.82 3 1024). At 50% risk for progressing to
AD dementia, the expected age for developing AD
dementia is approximately 85 years for an individual
with low PHS (�16 percentile); however, for an individ-
ual with high PHS (�84 percentile), the expected age of
onset is approximately 78 years. In all Cox models, the
proportional
hazard
assumption
was
valid
for
all
covariates.
Evaluating clinical progression and cognitive decline
within the CN individuals, we found significant PHS 3
time interactions for CDR-SB (ß 5 0.05, standard error
[SE] 5 0.02, p 5 3.64 3 1024), WAIS-R (ß 5 20.61,
SE 5 0.30, p 5 4.25 3 1022), TMTB (ß 5 22.48,
SE 5 0.99, p 5 1.20 3 1022), and fDST (ß 5 20.93,
SE 5 0.45, p 5 3.76 3 1022; Supplementary Table 1),
with significantly steeper slopes for high PHS individuals
for WAIS-R, TMTB, and CDR-SB (Supplementary
Table 2, Fig 2). Evaluating average percentage change
across all neuropsychological tests, we found that PHS
predicted cognitive decline (ß 5 0.84, SE 5 0.30, p 5
4.50 3 1023), with high PHS individuals showing
greater rates of decline (ß 5 21.80, SE 5 0.89, p 5
4.30 3 1022) compared to low PHS individuals (ß 5
20.12, SE 5 0.80, p 5 0.88). Goodness of fit compari-
son using likelihood ratio tests showed that the full LME
model comprising PHS and covariates resulted in a better
model fit for predicting decline in CDR-SB, BNT,
WAIS-R, fDST, and TMTB (Supplementary Table 3).
We found similar results within the MCI individuals and
the combined CN and MCI cohort (Supplementary
Tables
1–7),
illustrating
that
polygenic
information
beyond APOE E4 can identify asymptomatic and mildly
symptomatic individuals at highest risk for clinical and
cognitive decline.
Finally, among CN individuals with moderate and
frequent CERAD C score at autopsy, we found that PHS
predicted change in CDR-SB over time (ß 5 1.25,
SE 5 0.28, p 5 6.63 3 1026), with high PHS individu-
als showing a greater rate of increase (ß 5 5.62, SE 5
0.92, p 5 1.23 3 1029). In a reduced model without
PHS, APOE E4 status did not predict change in CDR-
SB (ß 5 0.26, SE 5 0.50, p 5 0.61). Furthermore,
even in APOE E4 noncarriers, PHS predicted change in
CDR-SB over time (ß 5 2.11, SE 5 0.38, p 5 3.06 3
1028), with high PHS individuals showing a greater rate
of increase (ß 5 6.11, SE 5 1.08, p 5 1.60 3 1028).
Similarly, among CN individuals with Braak stage III–IV
at autopsy, PHS predicted change in CDR-SB over time
(ß 5 0.93, SE 5 0.24, p 5 1.11 3 1024), with high
PHS individuals showing a greater rate of increase (ß 5
3.98, SE 5 0.79, p 5 4.45 3 1027).
Discussion
Here, we show that PHS predicts time to progress to AD
dementia and longitudinal cognitive decline in both

 preclinical AD and MCI. Among CN individuals with
moderate to high CERAD and Braak scores at autopsy,
we
found
that
PHS
predicted
longitudinal
clinical
decline, even among APOE E4 noncarriers. Beyond
APOE, our findings indicate that PHS can be useful to
identify asymptomatic older individuals at greatest risk
for developing AD neurodegeneration.
These results illustrate the value of leveraging the
polygenic architecture of the AD process. Building on
prior work,4,5 our findings indicate that polygenic
information may be more informative than APOE for
predicting clinical and cognitive progression in preclin-
ical AD. Although prior studies have used polygenic
risk scores in preclinical AD,12–14 by focusing on max-
imizing differences between cases and controls, this
approach is clinically suboptimal for assessing an age-
dependent process like AD dementia, where a subset of
controls will develop dementia over time (see Fig 1).
Furthermore, given the bias for selecting diseased cases
and normal controls, baseline hazard/risk estimates
derived from GWAS samples cannot be applied to
older individuals from the general population.15 By
employing an age-dependent, survival analysis frame-
work
and
integrating
AD-associated
SNPs
with
established population-based incidence rates,16 PHS
provides an accurate estimate of age of onset risk in
preclinical AD.
In our neuropathology analyses, PHS predicted
longitudinal clinical decline in older individuals, with
moderate to high amyloid or tau pathology indicating
that PHS may serve as an enrichment strategy for sec-
ondary prevention trials. Congruent with recent find-
ings that the risk of dementia among APOE E4/4 is
lower than previously estimated,17 among CN subjects
with moderate to high amyloid load, we found that
APOE did not predict clinical decline and PHS pre-
dicted change in CDR-SB even among APOE E4 non-
carriers. Our combined findings suggest that beyond
APOE, PHS may prove useful as both a risk stratifica-
tion and an enrichment marker to identify asymptom-
atic
individuals
most
likely
to
develop
Alzheimer
neurodegeneration.
