Agricultural pesticide use and adverse birth
outcomes in the San Joaquin Valley of California
Ashley E. Larsen1, Steven D. Gaines1 & Olivier Deschênes2
Virtually all agricultural communities worldwide are exposed to agricultural pesticides. Yet,
the health consequences of such exposure are poorly understood, and the scientific literature
remains ambiguous. Using individual birth and demographic characteristics for over 500 000
birth observations between 1997–2011 in the agriculturally dominated San Joaquin Valley,
California, we statistically investigate if residential agricultural pesticide exposure during
gestation, by trimester, and by toxicity influences birth weight, gestational length, or birth
abnormalities. Overall, our analysis indicates that agricultural pesticide exposure increases
adverse birth outcomes by 5–9%, but only among the population exposed to very high
quantities of pesticides (e.g., top 5th percentile, i.e., ~4200 kg applied over gestation).
Thus, policies and interventions targeting the extreme right tail of the pesticide distribution
near human habitation could largely eliminate the adverse birth outcomes associated with
agricultural pesticide exposure documented in this study.

or millennia, agriculture has had far-reaching impacts on
human society and natural systems1–3. However, the
development of modern pesticides, alongside other techno-
logical advances of the green revolution, caused dramatic
production increases but also concomitant increases in environ-
mental and health concerns. Numerous studies have documented
negative effects of pesticides on a wide range of organisms as well
as ecosystem services such as water and air quality4, 5. However,
documentation of direct negative effects of non-occupational
pesticide exposure on human health has proven much more
elusive, despite substantial public apprehension6, 7.
Reproductive harm tied to chemical exposure is of particular
concern, because health at birth is correlated with both adult
health8 and non-health attributes (e.g., wages and educational
attainment9, 10). Further, negative birth outcomes, such as low
birth weight, preterm birth, and birth abnormalities, have been
causally associated with other environmental conditions during
pregnancy, including air pollution11–13, extreme heat14,
15,
and maternal residence in proximity to toxic release sites16.
Nevertheless, evidence linking residential agricultural pesticide
exposure with adverse birth outcomes remains equivocal7.
The absence of conclusive evidence of the health impacts of
agricultural pesticide use may be due in part to the logistical
challenges of health research. Since controlled studies are clearly
unethical, much of the available evidence relating pesticides to
adverse health outcomes comes from occupationally exposed
groups, such as certified pesticide applicators17–19, which may not
reflect exposures that are relevant for the broader agricultural
community. Due to a lack of refined pesticide use data for most
regions, studies of non-occupational pesticide exposure either use
broad, correlative measures of pesticide use at large scales or seek
detailed measures of individual exposure via blood/urine samples
or interviews. While such refined measures provide a valuable
metric of exposure at multiple snapshots during gestation, the
costs and logistical challenges associated with such approaches
often constrain sample sizes to between 100–2000 births making
statistical analyses of rare outcomes difficult7, 17, 20, 21.
These logistical challenges have resulted in creative attempts to
tie proxies of pesticide exposure to adverse birth outcomes. For
instance, at the broadest scale, Winchester et al.22 associated
seasonal differences in pesticide concentrations in surface waters
with national rates of birth defects. Similarly, Schreinemachers23
investigated birth defects as a function of county wheat acreage—
which they used as a proxy for herbicide exposure, while
Petit et al.24 investigated birth weight and fetal growth as a
function of crop composition—which they interpret as a proxy
for insecticides. These studies suggested significant negative
effects of pesticides on birth defects22, 23 and fetal growth24.
However, studies with more refined measures of agricultural
pesticide exposure and/or birth outcomes have generally reported
null or inconsistent effects of exposure on birth defects7, 20, low
birth weight25, 26, and gestational length17, in part due to the
consistently low number of comparisons17, 26.
Previous studies using blood serum, urine samples, or inter-
views have often focused on specific chemicals or classes of
chemicals27, 28 for feasibility. Yet, in most agricultural commu-
nities a great diversity of chemicals are applied daily, making it
difficult to isolate the effects of any specific toxic agent due to
other chemicals in the environment and the understudied
synergistic or antagonistic interactions among them29, 30. Even
if one could isolate exposure to a specific chemical group,
pesticide metabolites in blood serum and urine still reflect
exposure to different chemicals across a range of toxicities within
a given chemical group31. Further, half-lives range from a few
hours to weeks for some chemicals of high concern, such as
organophosphorous (OP) insecticides, making it difficult to
accurately capture exposure to even one chemical group over
gestation.
The confounding effects of unobserved exposures or other
unobserved factors (e.g., unobserved health behaviors like
prenatal doctor visits) may underlie some of the counterintuitive
results in the literature. For example, in an innovative pooled
cohort study evaluating pesticide exposure and birth outcomes in
an agricultural community in the Salinas Valley, CA as well as
urban populations in New York and Cincinnati, Harley et al.31
reported no significant effects of OP metabolite levels on birth
weight overall or for the agricultural population in particular.
Yet, the same study reported a negative effect of OP metabolite
levels in urban minority populations,
despite
their lower
average OP metabolite levels relative to the agricultural group.
Additionally, studies have found statistically significant negative
associations between living in proximity to agriculture and
adverse outcomes (e.g., time to pregnancy), but not with pesticide
metabolite levels directly32. Similarly counterintuitive results
have illustrated that specific chemicals such as methyl bromide
or OP pesticides have negative associations with some birth
outcomes, but also unexpected positive associations (exposure
increasing body length or gestational age) for others30, 33.
Data-driven statistical approaches can provide complementary
insight
into
these
questions.
Large
samples
provide
a
powerful opportunity to control for various different demo-
graphic and environmental characteristics that may be obscuring
the relationship between agricultural pesticide exposure and
adverse birth outcomes in surrounding communities.
Here we revisit the relationship between pesticide exposure
and birth outcomes using a large sample of births (>500 000),
which includes individual-level data on maternal and birth char-
acteristics, and pesticide exposure at a small geographical scale.
We concentrate on the agriculturally dominated San Joaquin

San Joaquin Valley is the state’s most productive agricultural
region, growing an abundance of high value, high chemical input,
and labor-intensive fruit, vegetable, and nut crops35. We evaluate
pesticide exposure by summing active ingredients of agricultural
pesticides applied over gestation, by trimester, and by grouped the

acute toxicity categories, along with several additional robustness
checks. For outcomes, we focus on birth weight, gestational age,
and birth abnormalities. Our sample of over 500 000 individual
birth observations and fine-scale data on the timing and amount
of pesticide applied allow us to detect statistically significant
negative effects of pesticide exposure for all birth outcomes, but
generally only for pregnancies exposed to the very highest levels of
pesticides (top 5 or 1% of exposure quantities).
Results
Summary statistics. Pesticide use in the San Joaquin Valley
follows an extremely skewed distribution (Fig. 1), and is highly
variable
year-to-year
(Fig.
2).
Average
annual
(12-month,
January–December) pesticide use, weighted by number of births,
was ~975 kg per ~2.6 km2 area for 1997–2011. Not all areas in the
San
Joaquin
Valley
are
agriculturally
producing
regions,
and population centers with the most births have less agricultural
land area. In our sample of singleton births to mothers residing
in California (see Methods for other sample restrictions), over
50% of the births experienced zero pesticide exposure during a
nine month gestation, where exposure is measured as kg of
active ingredients applied in the 2.6 km2 Public Land Survey
Section (“PLS Section”) encompassing the mother’s address
(Supplementary Table 1). Despite a median exposure of zero,
average exposure over gestation was almost 750 kg, and the 75,
95, and 99% of exposure were about 250, 4000, and 11 000 kg,
respectively (Fig. 1; Supplementary Table 1). Since pesticide use
follows an extremely skewed distribution and the functional form
of the relationship between pesticide use and birth outcomes is
unknown and could be non-linear, we report results using several
measures of pesticide exposure.
We target our analyses on the effects of pesticide exposure to a
subsample of regions that included 137 210 observations and had
the highest level of pesticide exposure (Table 1, Supplementary
Table 1), as well as the highest representation of mothers with less
than a high school degree (37%) and mothers of Hispanic origin
(68%). Possibly reflecting the “Latino Epidemiologic Paradox”36,
this
subsample
had
the
lowest
average
rate
of
adverse
birth outcomes (Table 1). Below we refer to this subsample as
the “focal sample”.
Main analysis. In the focal sample, we find that the consequences
of being in the high exposure group (95th percentile and above)
vs. the low exposure group (all others) differed among the
different birth outcomes (i.e., birth weight, gestation length,
and birth abnormalities.) There was little effect of cumulative
exposure over gestation or by EPA acute toxicity category on the
probability of low birth weight (<2500 g, or ~5.5 lbs). We do find
a statistically significant decrease in birth weight of about 0.4% or
~13 g with cumulative pesticide exposure and pesticide exposure
in the first trimester for individuals in the high exposure group
relative to the low exposure group (Table 2; Supplementary
Table 2). For all results, statistical significance is based on
two-tailed t-tests of the estimated regression coefficients where
the standard errors are clustered at the zipcode level.
For gestational length and the probability of short gestation
(<259 d or 37 weeks), there are negative effects of high pesticide
exposure. Being in the high exposure group for cumulative
pesticides over gestation reduces gestational length by ~0.1%
or ~9 hours and increases the probability of preterm birth by ~8%
(9.8% of births are preterm in the focal sample and thus a 0.00745
increase in the probability of preterm birth is equivalent to a 7.6%
increase in this sample; Tables 1 and 2). High exposure to low
acute toxicity chemicals over gestation reduces gestational length
by ~0.1%, while exposure in the second trimester reduces the
probability of preterm birth by ~5%.
For birth abnormalities, being in the high vs. low pesticide
exposure group for cumulative pesticide use over gestation
increased the probability of a birth abnormality by ~9% (5.8% of

 births have a birth abnormality in this sample). Exposure by
toxicity category and by trimester had no significant effect in the
binary model.
Parsing pesticide use by aerial and ground application, we
found being in the high exposure group for ground applications
had a significant effect on log birth weight, log gestation, preterm
birth, and birth abnormalities with magnitudes similar to those
reported above (Table 3). Ground application represents roughly
95% of total active ingredients used, and thus high ground
exposure represents most of the cumulative pesticide exposure
measure (Supplementary Table 1).
Robustness tests. To explore if either inaccuracies in geocoding
or spillover of pesticides from surrounding areas contaminated
our results we excluded births for mothers living within 200 m of
a PLS Section boundary. We found a similar overall pattern of
statistical significance as in the larger sample. Although the
magnitude
of
the
coefficients
increased,
the
effects
on
birth weight and gestational length remained <1%, and the effects
on the probability of low birth weight, preterm birth, and
abnormalities were at most 13% higher for the high exposure
group relative to the low exposure group (Table 3).
We also estimated the trimester model including pesticide
use in the “fourth trimester” (i.e., the 3 months following birth).
As anticipated, exposure during the three months following birth
did not have a significant effect on any outcomes observed at
birth (Table 3). This “placebo” analysis indicates that our
empirical results are unlikely to be caused by omitted trends or
factors that are correlated with both pesticide applications and
infant health.
To further ensure the robustness of our results and inference,
we checked different exposure cutoffs (births in the top 75th, or
top 99th percentiles pesticide exposure as the “high exposure”
group) as well as a continuous measure of exposure (Supple-
mentary Methods, Supplementary Table 3). The magnitude
of effects was small and generally non-significant with the
75th percentile cutoff. Being in the top one percent of
pesticide exposure led to an 11% increased probability of preterm
birth, 20% increased probability of low birth weight, and
~30 g decrease in birth weight relative to lower exposure
(<99th percentile).
We also evaluated models with different location fixed effects,
different assumptions about clustering the standard errors to
address spatial and temporal error correlation, different sample
exclusion restrictions on gestational age and different calculations
of trimester, as well as models with other environmental
contaminants that can affect in utero infant health (ozone, carbon
monoxide, and temperature; Supplementary Note 1, Supplemen-
tary Tables 4–7). Although the exact magnitude and patterns of
significance did change with these different models, all models
consistently reported similar effect sizes. Overall, we report over
100 coefficients in the main text, of which 19 are significant. It is
noteworthy that in all these tests, only a single significant
coefficient in one model has the opposite sign from that expected.
The fact that only one of roughly 20 statistically significant
coefficients has the wrong sign is consistent with the notion that
our empirical estimates are not plagued (at least to a first-order)
by omitted variable bias. Further, since we do not adjust p-values
for multiple comparisons, the number of significant effects we
report is an upper bound on the “true” number of significant
effects. Applying a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons
that accounts for five outcomes and up to five covariates of
interest (for the trimester model with trimesters “0–4”), the α-level
for statistical significance would change from 0.05 to as small as
0.002 (0.05 divided by 25). The only three coefficients that
remained statistically significant with this Bonferroni correction
were those associated with a single covariate of interest, total
pesticide exposure over the gestation (αcorrected = 0.01). Of these,
two were associated with preterm birth (Tables 2 and 3) and one
with log gestation (Table 3).
Discussion
Concerns about the effects of harmful environmental exposure
on birth outcomes have existed for decades. Great advances
have been made in understanding the effects of smoking and air
pollution, among others, yet research on the effects of pesticides
has remained inconclusive. While environmental contaminants
generally share the ethical and legal problems of evaluating the
health consequences of exposure in a controlled setting and the
difficulties associated with rare outcomes, pesticides present an
additional challenge. Unlike smoking, which is observable, or
even air pollution, for which there exists a robust network of
monitors, publicly available pesticide use data are lacking for
most of the world. As a result, studies have typically been either
highly correlative at coarse resolutions or have included a small
number of subjects. Both constraints make it difficult to assess
whether residential agricultural pesticide exposure has no effect

 or whether logistical and analytical barriers have obfuscated the
identification of important effects.
Our study bridges the gap between detail and scale by lever-
aging vast pesticide and birth data for the San Joaquin Valley, CA.
Our study has far stronger statistical power to identify effects than
previous studies owing to over a hundred thousand birth obser-
vations, individual maternal and birth characteristics, and the
inclusion of fine-scale regional and temporal fixed effects (PLS
Township-year and birth month indicator variables). As a result
of our statistical design, we have the analytical power to identify
extremely small, but statistically significant negative effects of
pesticide exposure on several birth outcomes, if they occur.
Furthermore, our study design and extensive pesticide data
enable us to evaluate many details of the nature of pesticide
exposure. For example, we can evaluate whether pesticide expo-
sure in different trimesters or pesticides of different toxicity levels
affected birth outcomes in different ways. Fetal susceptibility to
environmental exposure varies through development37. Similarly,
different chemical toxicity can have different expected health
outcomes. Here we focused on aggregate chemicals grouped into
high and low toxicity pesticides by their EPA Signal Word, which
reflects acute toxicity. Acute toxicity does not necessarily indicate
impacts from long-term exposure. As such, chemicals suspected
to cause negative birth outcomes, such as organophosphates or
atrazine would be classified as low toxicity. Nevertheless, we
consistently find effects of less than a 10% increase in adverse
outcomes for individuals in the top 5% of exposure regardless of
timing or toxicity of exposure, even though which effects are
statistically significant depends on the model.
Pesticide exposure has a highly skewed distribution in the San
Joaquin Valley, where over half of births received no pesticides,
the top quarter received about 250 kg and the top 5% received over
16 times that amount. Further, exposure to the top 25% levels had
virtually no detectable effect whereas exposure to the top 1% had
effects that were up to double the magnitude of effects observed
for the top 5% of exposure. In other words, for most births, there
is no statistically identifiable impact of pesticide exposure on birth
outcome. Yet, for individuals in the top 5 percent of exposure,
pesticide exposure led to 5–9% increases in adverse outcomes. The
magnitude of effects were further enlarged for the top 1%, where
these extreme exposures (>11 000 kg over gestation) led to an 11%
increased probability of preterm birth, 20% increased probability
of low birth weight, and ~30 g decrease in birth weight.
For perspective, other environmental conditions such as air
pollution and extreme heat generally report a 5–10% increase in
adverse birth outcomes, but from less extreme exposure13, 15, 38.
Similar magnitudes of effects are also observed for other,
non-exposure conditions of pregnancy. For example, stress dur-
ing pregnancy may increase the probability of low birth weight by
~6%39, while enrollment in supplemental nutrition programs is
estimated to reduce the probability of low birth weight by a
similar amount40.
The significance of the negative effects of extreme pesticide
exposure on birth outcomes is heightened by the fact that birth

Regression coefficients for three different measures of pesticide exposure in the full estimation sample (A) and the focal sample (B). All exposure variables are coded as binary variables with high
exposure (>95% exposure based on all births) and low exposure (all others) groups. Sum AI indicates total kg of pesticide active ingredients applied in the 2.6 km2 region encompassing mothers
addresses, “Tox” indicates total kg of active ingredients by toxicity categories based on the EPA signal word, and trimester indicates total kg by trimester. All models include a set of covariates to control
for characteristics of the mother and infant as well as regional and temporal dummy variables as described in the text (see Supplementary Table 2 for coefficients). These are omitted from the tables for
visual clarity. For all tables, standard errors, clustered at mother’s zipcode, are below the coefficients in parentheses. The statistical significance of two-tailed t-tests is indicated by * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01,
and *** indicates significance with a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Bold indicates significant coefficients in the expected direction and italics indicates the one significant coefficient with
the opposite than expected sign. Values reported in the text are converted to percent or units of change (days, grams) based on rates of outcomes in the sample (Table 1). For example, 9.8% of births are
preterm in the focal sample and thus a 0.00745 increase in the probability of preterm birth is equivalent to a 7.6% increase in this sample

 outcomes are persistent and costly. Reducing the incidence of
adverse birth outcomes has obvious benefits for individuals, but
also for society. Healthier babies require less intensive care as
infants, have better long term health and are higher achieving in
terms of earnings and employment10, 41. Thus, even small
reductions in adverse outcomes can economically offset societal
investment in programs such as supplemental nutrition programs
offered to millions of low-income women41.
Due to the concentration of negative outcomes at the very
highest pesticide exposures, policies, and interventions that target
the extreme right tail of the pesticide exposure distribution could
largely eliminate the adverse birth outcomes associated with
agricultural pesticide exposure documented in this study. As such,
valuable and pressing future directions for research should focus
on identifying the extreme pesticide users near human develop-
ment and on the underlying causes for their extreme quantities of
use. These insights are critical to designing appropriate and
adaptive interventions for the population living nearby.
For instance, crops vary dramatically in their average pesticide
use. Commodities such as grapes receive nearly 50 kg ha−1 per
year of insecticides alone in the San Joaquin Valley region42,
while other high value crops such as pistachios receive barely on
third of that amount. Within these broad differences, there are
also relevant differences among crops with regard to the chemical
composition and seasonal timing of pesticide application. Finally,
not all agricultural fields are in proximity to human settlement.
Rather, as we illustrate, areas with consistent births and pesticides
are a small fraction of the San Joaquin Valley. Thus, if extreme
pesticide areas and vulnerable populations could be identified,
strategies or interventions could be developed to mitigate the
likelihood of extreme exposures.
One further difficulty is isolating the roles of individual chemicals
and their mixtures in driving the negative outcomes. Doing so
is extremely challenging, because many chemicals are used in
conjunction or in close spatial or temporal windows. Using a large-
scale data-driven approach could provide a starting point from
which individual or community based studies could be built. For
example, statewide birth certificate data could enable the identifi-
cation of potential hot spots of negative (and rare) birth outcomes
while the Pesticide Use Reports provide a large sample of different
pesticide mixtures. This could yield valuable information for
targeting more detailed studies of individual exposures and difficult
to observe outcomes (e.g., time to pregnancy, fetal deaths) towards
regions and months of the highest concern.
There are some important limitations to our study. As
with other environmental contaminants, controlled experiments
evaluating the effects of pesticide exposure on birth outcomes are
impossible due to clear ethical and legal constraints. This presents
challenges both for interpretation and estimation. With regard to
interpretation,
we
cannot
observe
all
individual
adaptive
responses to pesticide use, such as staying indoors to avoid
exposure to pesticide. Further, we can only observe the effects on
live births. As a result, our estimates reflect both the direct effect
of exposure on live births and the mitigating effects of avoidance
behaviors. With regard to identification and estimation, estab-
lishing causality without random assignment into pesticide
exposure relies on quasi-experimental approaches, such as
the panel data models used here with observational data43.
While there is no way to formally test if our methods have
eliminated all sources of bias that preclude causal interpretation
of
the
regression
coefficients,
our
results
are
robust
to
multiple modeling approaches, including controlling for other
environmental contaminants such as ambient concentration of
pollutants and extreme temperatures. Similarly, we find no
significant
placebo
effects
of
exposure
in
the
3
months
following birth.

 Birth records do not fully capture adverse outcomes such
as abnormalities that are difficult to observe at birth nor are
they comprehensive with regards to socio-demographics. Mea-
surement error on the outcome variable would not bias our
estimates of the effects of pesticide exposure unless it was
somehow correlated with pesticide use, yet it could reduce our
precision and thus the likelihood of finding statistical significance.
With respect to sociodemographic factors, mothers that are
exposed to extreme levels of pesticide are more likely to be
minorities and have lower education than the sample population
as a whole. While we control for these factors, there is potential
for the high exposure sample to differ in other unobserved ways
(e.g., unobserved maternal health behaviors) that could yield a
higher likelihood of adverse birth outcomes. If so, this would
result in overestimates of the effects of pesticide exposure on
adverse birth outcomes.
Additionally, we measure pesticide exposure as all pesticide use
(active ingredients) on production agriculture in the 2.6 km2 PLS
Section encompassing mothers’ addresses. We do so because the
diversity of chemicals applied in the San Joaquin Valley is
extensive and the cumulative effects of multiple exposures are not
well understood. However, some chemicals or combinations of
chemicals may not be relevant to reproductive risk. Thus, our
coefficients are likely underestimates for individuals exposed to a
disproportionately high fraction of chemicals of reproductive
concern for their PLS Section, year and birth month.
There is some indication that closer proximity to agricultural
fields (<1000 m) results in increased odds of adverse birth out-
comes7, 20, 44. For a study of this spatial and temporal breadth it is
infeasible to directly measure distance from a sprayed field.
However, for the San Joaquin Valley, PLS Sections that have any
agriculture generally are agriculturally dominated45. Furthermore,
the PLS Section is roughly 2276 m on a diagonal. Thus it is highly
likely that the vast majority of households in PLS Sections with
pesticide use are within 1000 m of a treated agricultural field.
If pesticides dissipate much more rapidly, such that the effect
is concentrated within 100 m of pesticide use, our study
design would underestimate this relationship due to dilution with
individuals living farther away from fields but still within the
same PLS Section exposure. However, for this to be occurring,
the population residing on-farm or adjacent to fields must be
much smaller than the broader population residing in the San
Joaquin Valley for us to observe such small coefficients. Indeed,
this makes intuitive sense for California, where farmworkers
overwhelmingly report living independent of their employers
in houses or rental units, particularly if they have a spouse or
children (93%)46. However, our results may under predict adverse
birth outcomes in regions where a larger proportion of workers
reside in employer-provided housing on or adjacent to fields,
where a larger fraction of pesticide are applied aerially, or where
permissible chemicals are more environmentally persistent or
toxic to humans.
We also lack information on residence time at mother’s
address and employment. Much of the San Joaquin Valley
economy is driven by the agricultural industry. If farmworkers
were mostly migratory and followed the harvest, our measure of
residential pesticide exposure would be inaccurate for this subset
of the population. Yet, according to the National Agricultural
Workers Surveys for 1996–2011, California farmworkers, espe-
cially if they have a spouse or children in their household, are
settled (~98%)46. Our measure of exposure would also be artifi-
cially high if women were applying agricultural pesticides during
pregnancy. While ~18% of California farmworkers are women,
only 1.5% of women reported using pesticides in the past
12 months and 0% of women with a spouse or children had
reported doing so46. Women could get additional exposure via
their spouses, and ~16% of male farm workers reported loading,
mixing or applying pesticides in the past year46.
Finally, the San Joaquin Valley is well known to have
substandard environmental quality, frequently exceeding EPA
contamination levels for air quality. If such exposures co-vary
with pesticide use and vary at small spatial and temporal scales,
the coefficient on pesticide exposure could capture additional
contamination despite our PLS Township-year and birth month
controls. While we cannot be certain we have eliminated all
sources of contamination that co-vary with pesticides, including a
rich set of ambient air quality and temperature metrics did not
change the basic results of this paper.
In conclusion, there is a growing literature on the relationship
between pesticide exposure and adverse birth outcomes. Yet,
evidence of a causal link between infant health and agricultural
pesticide exposure remains uncertain due to small samples and lack
of maternal or birth characteristics. Our study is the most
comprehensive to date, bringing together the largest data file ever
compiled on street-address level birth outcomes and fine scale
exposure to agricultural pesticides. We provide robust evidence that
there are multiple negative effects of residential agricultural pesticide
exposure on adverse birth outcomes, but only for births exposed to
very high levels of pesticides during gestation. The documented
concentration of impacts in the extreme upper tail of the pesticide
exposure distribution may explain why previous studies fail to
consistently detect effects of pesticides on birth outcomes. Further-
more, the concentration of impacts in the extreme tail of the
pesticide exposure distribution provides policy challenges and public
health opportunities to balance these potentially serious but rare
outcomes with the societal benefits of continued pesticide use.
Methods
Birth data. Birth Data came from the California Birth Statistical Master File
(BSMF) for 1997–2011. The BSMF includes individual birth records with
information on characteristics of the mother (e.g., age, education, race), char-
acteristics of the infant (e.g., sex, birth order), and birth outcomes for all births
occurring in the state. While the BSMF existed prior to 1997, 1997 is the first year
for which mother’s street address is provided, a field critical to our refined measure
of pesticide exposure. Further, 2011 is the last data year for which we had approval
from California Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects and California
Department of Public Health to evaluate the relationship between pesticides and
adverse birth outcomes at the time of submission.
We geocoded singleton births to mothers residing in the San Joaquin Valley,
CA (Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, Merced, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, and Tulare
counties; 2) using the U.S. Census TIGER/Line shapefile for 2011 as the Address
Locator in ArcGIS 10.0. Following Zhan et al.47 we set spelling sensitivity to 50,
minimum candidate score to 30, minimum match score to 70, and offset from the
midline and end to 25 ft and 0 ft, respectively. Match rates for all years were
88–93%. Geocoded addresses were matched with the PLS Section (~2.6 km2)
encompassing the address for linking to the pesticide data. The projection for all
files was North American Datum 1983 California Teale Albers.
We excluded births if gestation was <26 weeks or >50 weeks or if gestational
age was missing (n = 59 226). Gestational length for all observations was based on
last menstrual period. From the sample with gestational age within the above
limits, we excluded births if birth weight was reported as >5500 g, <250 g, or
missing, or if total reported births (to the same mother) were >15 (n = 746). Since
accurate assignment of location was of paramount importance to our measure of
pesticide exposure, we further restricted the sample to match scores >85 after spot-
checking matched addresses (n = 24 349). Limiting our sample to singleton births
to mothers residing in the San Joaquin Valley, CA with the above restrictions
resulted in a sample of 753 290 births (“All births”). The binary cutoffs of pesticide
exposure (i.e., 95%, 99%) were based on this sample. In 2006, the BSMF did not
include data on maternal tobacco use and as a result, we dropped this entire year
from the main analyses (though the inclusion of 2006 without tobacco as a
covariate did not change our conclusions). The analysis sample, composed of all
observations except those in 2006, was 692 589 (“full sample”) and the analysis
sample composed of observations that occurred in regions with pesticides and
births in each year was 137 210 (“focal sample”; see Exposure, Econometric
analysis, Supplementary Fig. 1).
Pesticide data. Pesticide data came from the California Department of Pesticide
Regulation (DPR) Pesticide Use Reports (PUR) for 1996–2012. The PUR includes
detailed temporal and geographical information on agricultural pesticide use,

 including date of pesticide application, pounds of active ingredients (AI), method
of application (ground, aerial), and EPA signal word (in decreasing toxicity:
Danger or Danger-Poison (I), Warning (II), Caution (III), no word (IV)). The
PUR data are available at the ~2.6 km2 (1 mi2) PLS Section, which is nested within
~93 km2 (36 mi2) PLS Townships.
The PUR data are internally checked for entry errors as well as outliers using
multiple methodologies48. Outliers are flagged by the DPR if values exceed 50 times
the median for a product–crop–year combination, or if use rates are >224 kg ha−1
(200 lbs ac−1) or 1121 kg ha−1 (1000 lbs ac−1) for fumigants. About 2% of records
are found to have some type of error when checked by DPR, and entry errors are
sent back to the county for correction while outliers that cannot be corrected by the
county are adjusted to median use rate by product–crop–year48, 49. While the true
error rate is unknown, the PUR data are widely considered highly accurate and the
most accurate pesticide data in the world49.
Exposure. Total pesticide application (kg of active ingredients) was summed over
gestation and by trimester. Pesticide use by EPA signal word toxicity (grouped into
high-I–II and low-III–IV) and by method of application (aerial, ground) was also
summed over gestation. We aggregate chemicals grouped into high and low acute
toxicity due to the large number of different chemicals applied in the San Joaquin
Valley. To assess exposure we calculated gestation as the birth month and 8 pre-
vious months if the birth was on or after the 15th of the month and as the 9
preceding months if the birth was before the 15th of the month. We divided
gestation into trimesters similarly, counting back from birth month. We counted
backwards from birth month rather than forward from last menstrual period to
reduce potential bias stemming from pesticide exposure altering the menstrual
cycle50 and thus trimester cutoffs based on last menstrual period.
We focused on binary measures of exposure, because the functional form of the
relationship between pesticide exposure and birth outcomes is not well understood
and could be nonlinear. We defined high exposure as being in the top 95th percentile
or above based on all births with the above described sample restrictions, and low as
all others. Thus, pesticide coefficients for such a binary comparison are interpreted as
the effect of being in the high exposure group compared to the low exposure group.
For robustness, we also estimated other model specifications using different binary
cutoffs (99% as “high exposure” and 75% as “high exposure”). The 75th, 95th, and
99th percentile were based on the distribution of pesticide exposure for all births, and
corresponded to 249, 4178, and 11 134, respectively (Supplementary Table 1). We also
tried a continuous specification. The continuous, linear model makes the stronger
assumption of a linear relationship between pesticides and birth outcomes, which
would fail under the plausible scenario of exposure thresholds or saturation of effects.
For completeness, we nevertheless tested a continuous specification. Finally, we
explored a restricted cubic spline specification for cumulative pesticide exposure with
knots at the 75, 95, and 99% of the pesticide distribution. Due to the extremely skewed
pesticide distribution (Fig. 1), we continued with the binary split for computational
and interpretational ease.
Econometric analysis. We created a panel dataset using the above individual birth
data and PLS Section-level measures of pesticide exposure. The empirical analysis
was based on the estimation of variants of the following regression model:
Bitsyw ¼ δ0 þ AItsywθ þ Xitsywβ þ αty þ γm þ εitsyw
ð1Þ
where i denotes the individual birth, t denotes PLS Township, s represents PLS
Section, and y, m, and w denote the year, month, and week of birth, respectively. B
is a birth outcome, such as log birth weight or an indicator of preterm birth. AI
represents different binary measures of active ingredient use. Depending on the
model, it can be a scalar equal to one if total pesticide AI use during gestation is in
the top 5% of the sample and zero otherwise. Or it can be a vector of indicator
variables for AI by trimester, or by toxicity category. The coefficient θ is thus the
effect of being in the high exposure group compared to all other exposures. The
vector X represents individual level indicator variables for mother’s age group
(<19, 19–24, 25–35, 36+, missing), educational attainment (<high school, high
school, some college, college or more, missing; Supplementary Note 1), race/eth-
nicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, missing), tobacco use
(no use, use, missing; Supplementary Note 1), number of prenatal care visits
(<5, 5–8, 9–14, 15+, missing), infant’s sex (male, female, missing), and whether it
was first born. αty represents PLS Township-by-year indicator variables or “fixed-
effects”. These fixed-effects effectively de-mean attributes of a given birth by the
PLS Township average in the birth year43. This accounts for time invariant
characteristics shared by all births within a PLS Township in a given year that may
be difficult to observe and could otherwise bias the estimation of θ (e.g., local
economic activity and/or the quality of local health care providers). γm represents a
month fixed effect, used to control for seasonality differences in birth outcomes and
pesticide exposure shared across locations and years. These fixed effects rely on
variability in pesticide application within PLS Sections over time. Pesticide use is
highly variable over time even at small spatial scales (Fig. 2), due in large part to
on-farm decisions such as crop type and crop rotation, as well as other highly
variable conditions such as weather. Finally, we used cluster robust standard errors,
clustered at the zipcode, which allow for arbitrary serial correlation in the errors
within zipcodes. For robustness, we evaluated models with zipcode-year rather
than PLS Township-year fixed effects and standard errors clustered at the PLS
Township rather than zipcode.
We estimate this equation for five birth outcomes; log birth weight (g), log
gestational age (d), low birth weight (<2500 g), preterm birth (<259 d), and birth
abnormality (congenital anomaly and abnormal conditions/procedures;
Supplementary Note 1, Supplementary Table 8). For very rare events, estimating
linear probability models for binary outcomes can be problematic. However, none
of these outcomes are especially rare in our sample (≥4.5%), and linear probability
models are much more conducive to implementation of fixed effects models43.
Controlling for individual level behavior and risk through the use of mother’s
fixed effects would have further reduced concerns about omitted variables bias.
However, information that would have allowed us to identify births to the same
mothers across different years in the California BSMF was unavailable. As a result,
including mother’s fixed effects was impossible. We controlled for a variety of
observable characteristics in our estimation strategy, yet there are characteristics
that separate agricultural, suburban, and urban dwellers in ways that are difficult to
observe. To isolate a population with higher exposure (who may also be more
affected by pesticide exposure) and more homogeneous observable characteristics,
we constructed a subsample of births—births in PLS Sections with pesticides and
births in all years (“focal sample”).
For robustness, and to probe the underlying mechanisms of exposure, we ran
additional models on the focal sample. First, we divided exposure into aerial and
ground application and re-evaluated total exposure by application method for each
of the five birth outcomes. Next, to check if either inaccuracies in geocoding or
spillover of pesticides from surrounding areas contaminated our results, we reran
the analysis with addresses in the interior of each PLS Section (at least 200 m from
the PLS Section boundary), which excluded over 40% of each PLS Section area and
associated births. We further tested models with gestation restricted to <44 weeks,
removing the small fraction of pesticides that are categorized as adjuvants, and
calculating trimester from date of last menses forward (Supplementary Table 7).
We also analyzed models including pesticide exposure in the 3 months following
birth (the “4th trimester”) as a placebo test. Finally, we investigated the potential
from confounding environmental pollution and temperature than can affect in
utero infant health. It is well documented the San Joaquin Valley, CA has poor air
quality51. Using data from the California Air Resources Board Ambient Air Quality
Monitoring Stations as well as data from the National Climatic Data Center
(NCDC) Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily (GHCN-Daily), we
included binned covariates for quantiles of ambient ozone and carbon monoxide
levels (<70, 70–90, 90–95, >99%) as well as temperature bins (45, 45–65, 65–85,
>85 °F; 7.22, 7.22–18.33, 18.33–29.44, >29.44 °C) totaled over gestation and by
trimester (Supplementary Note 1).
For ease of interpretation in the text, the coefficients are converted to percent
change within the sample population. Thus, for binary outcomes (e.g., birth
abnormalities), coefficients were scaled by the rate of the outcome in the focal sample
and multiplied by 100. For example, a 0.005 increase in the probability of a positive
outcome in the focal sample (Table 2), in which 5.8% of births have an abnormality
(Table 1), is equivalent to an 8.6% increase in this outcome in this sample.

tistical Master file analyzed in the current study is not publicly available. It can be
