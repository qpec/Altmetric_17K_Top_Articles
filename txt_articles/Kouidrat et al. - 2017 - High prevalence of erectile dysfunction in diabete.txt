ABSTRACT 
Erectile dysfunction may be common among men with diabetes, but its prevalence is still debated. 
We aimed to assess the relative prevalence of erectile dysfunction in diabetes searching major 
databases from inception to November 2016 for studies reporting erectile dysfunction in men with 
Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes mellitus. We conducted a meta-analysis of the prevalence [and 95% 
confidence intervals (95% CIs)] of erectile dysfunction in diabetes compared with healthy controls, 
calculating the relative odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. A random effect model was applied. From 
3747 initial hits, 145 studies were included representing 88 577 men (age: 55.8 ` 7.9 years). The 
prevalence of erectile dysfunction in diabetes overall was 52.5% (95% CI, 48.8 to 56.2) after 
adjusting for publication bias, and 37.5%, 66.3% and 57.7% in Type 1, Type 2 and both types of 
diabetes, respectively (P for interaction < 0.0001). The prevalence of erectile dysfunction was 
highest in studies using the Sexual Health Inventory for Men (82.2%, 17 studies, P for interaction < 
0.0001). Studies with a higher percentage of people with hypertension moderated our results (beta 
= 0.03; 95% CI, 0.008 to 0.040; P = 0.003; R2 = 0.00). Compared to healthy controls (n = 5385) men 
with diabetes (n = 863) were at increased odds of having erectile dysfunction (OR 3.62; 95% CI, 2.53 
to 5.16; P < 0.0001; I2 = 67%, k = 8). Erectile dysfunction is common in diabetes, affecting more than 
half of men with the condition and with a prevalence odds of approximately 3.5 times more than 
controls. Our findings suggest that screening and appropriate intervention for men with erectile 
dysfunction is warranted.

INTRODUCTION 
The WHO Global Report on Diabetes states that the number of people with diabetes has risen from 
108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014, and that the global prevalence among adults has risen 
from 4.7% to 8.5% over the same period. The main and most considered complications of diabetes 
weigh on the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and nerves, and diabetes has been associated 
recently with specific cancers, physical and cognitive disability, and depression [1,2].  
Increasing attention is focusing on erectile dysfunction in men with diabetes due to its multifactorial 
pathophysiology and the concurrence of the same components as vasculopathy, neuropathy and 
depression [3]. Erectile dysfunction is defined as the inability to achieve and/or maintain an erection 
sufficient to permit satisfactory sexual intercourse [3]. Although erectile dysfunction is considered an 
age- related disease, affecting 20% of men aged > 40 years, it can be present across all the life-span 
from adolescence, especially when risk factors such as diabetes, metabolic syndrome or 
cardiovascular diseases coexist [4]. Diabetes is considered the main risk factor for the development 
of erectile dysfunction and since the 1970s the association between diabetes and the development 
of erectile dysfunction has been documented both in animal models and humans [5].  
Previous studies have suggested that erectile dysfunction is more prevalent in men with diabetes 
compared with healthy men [6], and increasing evidence emphasises this correlation [7,8]. However, 
the exact prevalence of this condition and the role of other potential moderators remain unclear in 
men with diabetes. Several narrative reviews have considered the prevalence of erectile dysfunction 
in diabetes and the majority agree that the incidence of erectile dysfunction in men with diabetes is 
two- to three-fold higher than in the general population. It is estimated that erectile dysfunction 
affects up to 75% of all men with diabetes, it is age correlated and occurs at a younger age in men 
with diabetes. Although these studies have significantly advanced our knowledge, there appears to 
be no meta-analysis of the synthesized data which would help provide the most reliable estimates of 
erectile dysfunction prevalence in men with diabetes compared with controls, and help us 
understand the moderating factors that might influence the relationship. Given that, for example, 
 4 
 
erectile dysfunction is associated with higher cardiovascular risk in men with diabetes, such analysis 
could be highly beneficial.  
Given this, the aim of this study was to conduct a meta- analysis of existing data to estimate 
prevalence of erectile dysfunction in diabetes and explore potential moderators.  
 
 
METHODS 
This systematic review adhered to the PRISMA [9] and MOOSE [10] statements and followed an a 
priori defined, but unpublished protocol available upon request.  
 
Data sources and literature search strategy 
Two investigators independently conducted a literature search using PubMed, EMBASE and SCOPUS 
from 1980 to 1 November 2016. In PubMed and other databases, the search strategy was (diabet*) 
AND (erectile dysfunction OR erectile function OR sexual dysfunction OR sexual function) AND 
(prevalence or odds or risk). Conference abstracts and the reference lists of included articles were 
hand-searched to identify and potential additional relevant articles. Any inconsistencies were 
resolved by consensus with a third author.  
 
Study selection  
Studies were included in the meta-analysis if they: (1) reported the prevalence of erectile 
dysfunction; (2) used a validated instrument for the diagnosis of erectile dysfunction, such as the 
international index of erectile function (IIEF) [11] or the Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) 
[12]; (3) included people with a validated diagnosis of diabetes (e.g. with the criteria suggested by 
the American Diabetes Association [13]; (4) included male participants. Also abstracts, if suitable 
with sufficient and quality data, were included.  
 5 
 
Studies were excluded if: (1) were not conducted in humans; (2) the sample consisted entirely of 
participants with both diabetes and erectile dysfunction (i.e. prevalence = 100% and a biased 
sample); (3) included only females.  
 
 
Data extraction  
Two independent investigators extracted key data from the included articles in a standardized Excel 
sheet and a third validated data extraction. For each article, we extracted data regarding authors, 
year of publication, country, setting, demographics (i.e. sample size, mean age), type of diabetes, 
diagnostic criteria used for erectile dysfunction, duration of diabetes, percentage of participants 
having the most common complications of diabetes (neuropathy, retinopathy, cardio- vascular 
disease, kidney failure) and some known risk factors for erectile dysfunction (smoking, obesity, 
hypertension).  
When some information was missing, first and/or corresponding authors of the original article were 
contacted at least twice in a month to obtain the variables of interest. For 23 eligible papers, we 
were unable to acquire the full texts and the authors did not respond to our requests. However, 
these abstracts contained sufficient data for meta-analysis and consequently they were included and 
treated as conference abstracts.  
 
Outcomes 
The main outcome of interest was the prevalence of erectile dysfunction in men with diabetes 
reported in the original paper both as percentage or as number of erectile dysfunction/number of 
men with diabetes. Where available, data regarding the prevalence of erectile dysfunction in healthy 
controls with no diabetes was also extracted.

Assessment of study quality 
Two authors assessed the quality of the studies included taking in account the following factors 
which after discussion we considered to represent important study features with respect to the 
current topic: (1) clear diagnostic criteria for diabetes; (2) clear diagnostic criteria for erectile 
dysfunction; (3) reporting the prevalence of at least one diabetic complication; and (4) reporting 
data on the duration of diabetes.  
 
 
 
Data synthesis and statistical analysis  
All analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta- Analysis (CMA) 3 (http://www.meta-
analysis.com).  
In the primary analysis, we calculated the prevalence of erectile dysfunction in diabetes with its 95% 
confidence intervals (% CIs) applying a random-effect model due to anticipated heterogeneity [14]. 
Prevalence was reported as a percentage. In secondary analysis, the prevalence of erectile 
dysfunction in men with diabetes vs. controls was compared using odds ratios (ORs) with their 95% 
CIs.  
Heterogeneity across studies was assessed by the I2 metric and Cochran’s Q chi-square statistics 
with a value ≥ 50% for the first and P < 0.05 indicating the presence of significant heterogeneity [15]. 
In case of high heterogeneity, sensitivity and meta-regression analyses were run to identify possible 
moderators of this heterogeneity. In sensitivity analyses, we stratified our results by continent 
(Africa, Asia, Europe, North and South America, Oceania, multicontinent), type of diabetes (Type 1, 
2, and studies including both forms, or not declared), setting (community, outpatients, not 
declared), type of article (original article or conference abstract), diagnostic tools for the presence of 
erectile dysfunction (IIEF-5, SHIM or other tools) and mean age (divided into 18–60 years and ≥ 60 
years or not declared). In meta-regression analysis, we analysed some potential moderators as 
 7 
 
continuous variables in the sample as whole, namely: duration of diabetes (years), study percentage 
of people with neuropathy, retinopathy, cardio- vascular disease, kidney failure, hypertension, mean 
BMI, and percentage of actual smokers.  
Potential publication bias was assessed by visually inspecting funnel plots and using the Egger bias 
test [16]. Then, to account for any publication bias, we used the trim-and-fill method, based on the 
assumption that the effect sizes of all the studies are normally distributed around the centre of a 
funnel plot; in the event of asymmetries, it adjusts for the potential effect of unpublished (imputed) 
studies [17]. Finally, we calculated the fail-safe number of negative studies that would be required to 
nullify each of our comparative analyses.  
For all analyses, P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS 
 
Search results 
The search yielded 3,747 non-duplicated articles. After excluding 3,441 articles based on 
title/abstract review, 306 articles were retrieved for full text review and 145 studies were finally 
included (Figure 1).  
 
Study and participants’ characteristics  
Full descriptive details of the included studies are reported in Table S1.  
Altogether, this meta-analysis included 145 studies (for the references see Table S2) and 88 577 
male participants with diabetes, with a mean age of 55.8 ` 7.9 years (range: 23.4– 71.7 years).  
A majority of the studies was conducted in Asia (61 studies, 41.8%), followed by Europe (48, 32.9%), 
North America (17, 11.6%) and Africa (15, 10.3%). All except 14 studies were performed among 
outpatients. Finally, most studies included people having a diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes only (70 
studies, n = 44 488 participants), followed by studies that did not declare which type of diabetes was 
included (45 studies, n = 18,424), both Type 1andType2(18studies,n=20061)andType1 only (12 
studies, n = 5604). The presence of erectile dysfunction was diagnosed mainly through the IIEF-5 (n = 
90 studies).  
The most common source of bias was the absence of data regarding diabetic complications, because 
this information was present in only 32 (22.1%) of the included studies.  
 
 
Prevalence of erectile dysfunction in diabetes  
As shown in Table 1, the overall prevalence of erectile dysfunction in diabetes was 59.1% (95% CI, 
55.5 to 62.7). This finding was characterized by a very high hetero- geneity (I2 = 99%) and by a 
publication bias (Egger’s test = 3.71 ` 1.32, P = 0.006). After conducting the trim and fill analysis, 20 
 9 
 
studies missing on the left were adjusted, with an estimated prevalence of erectile dysfunction in 
diabetes of 52.5% (95% CI, 48.8 to 56.2) (Table 1).  
 
Factors affecting erectile dysfunction prevalence  
As shown in Table 1, the prevalence of erectile dysfunction was significantly different across 
countries (P < 0.0001) and highest in studies conducted in South America (prevalence 74.6%; one 
study), Oceania (prevalence 74.4%; one study) and Africa (prevalence 71.3%; 15 studies) and lowest 
amongst North American studies (prevalence 34.5%; 17 studies).  
The prevalence of erectile dysfunction was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) in men with Type 2 
diabetes (prevalence 66.3%; 70 studies) compared with Type 1 diabetes (prevalence 37.5%; 12 
studies). Moreover, the prevalence of ED was significantly higher in the studies using the SHIM for 
assessing erectile dysfunction (prevalence 82.2%; 17 studies) and amongst those with a mean age > 
60 years (prevalence 66.7%; 23 studies) (Table 1). Conversely, the setting in which the study was 
performed (P = 0.37) and the type of article (P = 0.79) did not significantly moderate our findings.  
 
Meta-regression analysis 
Because our main outcome was characterized by a high heterogeneity (I2 = 99%) and the 
stratification shown in Table 1 was not able to explain any heterogeneity, we assessed if other 
factors could explain this heterogeneity. As shown in Table 2 among some potential possible 
moderators (including the most common chronic complication of diabetes, duration of diabetes and 
risk factors for erectile dysfunction such as smoking) only higher percentage of men with 
hypertension moderated our results (beta = 0.03; 95% CI, 0.008 to 0.040; P = 0.003) without, 
however, explaining any heterogeneity (R2 = 0.00).  
 
 
 
 10 
 
Comparison with the controls 
Eight studies reported the prevalence of erectile dysfunction in men with diabetes (n = 863) vs. 
healthy controls (n = 5385). As shown in Fig. 2, the prevalence of erectile dysfunction in men with 
diabetes vs. controls was almost doubled (51.6% vs. 25.5%), leading to an overall OR of 3.62 (95% CI, 
2.53 to 5.16; P < 0.0001; I2 = 67%). No evidence of publication bias was present for this outcome 
(Egger’s test 2.21 ` 1.44; P = 0.17) and the fail-safe number was 311.

DISCUSSION 
This is the first meta-analysis to assess the prevalence of erectile dysfunction in diabetes, 
synthesizing a large volume of international literature (including 145 studies and 88 577 male 
participants with diabetes). We showed an overall prevalence of erectile dysfunction of 59.1% in 
men with diabetes (52.5% if adjusted for publication bias). This condition was significantly higher in 
those with Type 2 diabetes compared with Type 1 diabetes, and in older participants. Men with 
diabetes tend to develop erectile dysfunction 10–15 years earlier than those without diabetes. In 
fact, erectile dysfunction is the third most frequent complication of diabetes that affects the quality 
of life and it is often indicative of underlying vasculopathy representing a predictor of more serious 
cardiovascular disorders [18]. Because the prevalence of diabetes is rising in high, middle, and low 
income countries, our work aimed to give an overall estimate of erectile dysfunction in diabetes 
across several continents [19].  
One of our main results is that the odds of erectile dysfunction in men with diabetes is more than 
three times higher relative to controls, with an overall OR = 3.62 (95% CI, 2.53 to 5.16; P < 0.0001; I2 
= 67%), and higher among men with a mean age > 60 years. These findings are consistent with the 
Massachusetts Male Aging Study in which men with diabetes showed a threefold probability of 
having erectile dysfunction compared with men without diabetes, and the age-adjusted risk of 
erectile dysfunction was doubled in men with diabetes compared with those without [20]. Notably, 
the global ageing of the world population as well as the dramatically increasing prevalence of 
diabetes mellitus may partially explain the worldwide prevalence of erectile dysfunction, which has 
been estimated to 322 million cases by the year 2025 [21].  
A comprehensive review including high-quality studies undertaken by Kamenov and colleagues [22] 
is consistent with our findings that advanced age and Type 2 diabetes are associated with an 
increased risk of erectile dysfunction. In addition, as shown in our analyses, the prevalence of 
erectile dysfunction in men with Type 2 diabetes is higher compared with those with Type 1 
 12 
 
diabetes. Indeed, many men may already have erectile dysfunction at the diagnosis of Type 2 
diabetes. Erectile dysfunction has been proven to be the first sign of diabetes, diagnosed later in 12–
30% of men [23]. Recently, Maseroli et al., found in a sample of 499 men (mean age 58.8 ` 8.8 years) 
with new or recently diagnosed Type 2 diabetes mellitus: mild erectile dysfunction in 19.4%, mild-to-
moderate in 15.4%, moderate in 10.4%, and severe in 21.6% of participants.  
Several cross-sectional and longitudinal studies showed an association between erectile dysfunction 
and most of the classical cardiovascular risk factors, including smoking [24], diabetes [25], 
hypertension [26], hyperlipidaemia, metabolic syndrome [27], as well as depression. Surprisingly, in 
our meta- regression analysis, hypertension only was associated with the diabetes-related erectile 
dysfunction (P = 0.003). However, in a large survey of 7689 men with diabetes and/or hypertension, 
erectile dysfunction according to the IIEF-5 score was present in 67% of those with hypertension 
alone, in 71% with diabetes alone, and in 77% of men with both diseases [26].  
There is increasing evidence of a direct link between erectile dysfunction and cardiovascular disease. 
Erectile dysfunction is a marker of early atherosclerosis and it is considered not only as a part of the 
quality of life, but also as an independent predictor of cardiovascular events and all- cause mortality. 
Moreover, in men with erectile dysfunction, the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes is higher than 
in the general population. Thus, erectile dysfunction should be considered a marker symptom for 
diabetes and men with erectile dysfunction should be screened for diabetes [28].  
Several identified factors contribute to the complex pathogenesis of diabetes-related erectile 
dysfunction including diabetic neuropathy, micro- and macrovascular arterial disease (oxidative 
stress, endothelial dysfunction, dyslipidaemia, arterial hypertension, etc.), hypogonadism, psy- 
chogenic components and drug side effects. The diagnostic process is based on the results of 
standardized questionnaires, vascular urologic and neurological investigations. One of the most used 
and practical questionnaires that is administered is the IIEF-5, with a score of ≤ 21 indicating the 
presence of erectile dysfunction [29]. However, depending on the age, duration and type of diabetes 
 13 
 
mellitus, and the used diagnostic criteria, epidemiological data about diabetes- related erectile 
dysfunction vary significantly between different studies [18]. Our analysis shows large differences in 
the reported prevalence of erectile dysfunction from approximately 35% to 80% among men with 
diabetes, which might be due to differences in methodology and population characteristics. 
Advancing age, duration of diabetes, poor glycaemic control, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, 
sedentary lifestyle, smoking and the presence of other diabetic complications have been shown to 
be associated with diabetes- related erectile dysfunction in cross-sectional studies [18].  
Regarding sexual activity and the psychological impact of erectile dysfunction in men with diabetes 
mellitus, significant and positive associations have been found between depressive symptoms and 
erectile dysfunction. In addition, erectile dysfunction contributes strongly to poorer quality of life in 
men with diabetes mellitus. Therefore, early detection of erectile dysfunction is essential to improve 
the psychological health and men’s quality of life. In this way, the management of erectile 
dysfunction in men with diabetes should involve a multidisciplinary approach in which psychosexual 
counselling and specialist urologist advice is required in addition to the skills and expertise of the 
specialist in metabolic diseases and to the traditional pharmacological therapy [30].  
Although our data offer novel insight into the extent of erectile dysfunction among men with 
diabetes, some limitations need to be considered. First, is the difficulty in providing erectile 
dysfunction prevalence by categories because of incomplete data available in published studies. 
Second, most information refers to the total population with diabetes and few studies have 
presented data separately for those with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Third, the analysis of the 
others risk factors contributing to the diabetes-related erectile dysfunction was limited because of 
the small number of primary studies that provide complete clinical and biological features of the 
participants. For example, the use of antidepressant medication, an important contributor of erectile 
dysfunction in men with diabetes, was not analysable as potential moderator of our findings.  
 14 
 
In conclusion, our study provides worldwide data on the prevalence of and risks factors for erectile 
dysfunction in diabetes. The relationship of erectile dysfunction with certain risk factors, such as age 
or cardiovascular risk factors (arterial hypertension), are well known and our study corroborates 
these associations. Future prospective and longitudinal studies in both but separately population 
with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, are needed to characterize others risk factors such as duration of 
disease or smoking which are involving in the development of erectile dysfunction. Furthermore, 
men with erectile dysfunction are at an increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity and/or mortality 
as well as for all-cause death. Thus, clinicians should have in mind that screening of erectile 
dysfunction in men with diabetes is a part of the assessment of their cardiovascular risk.
