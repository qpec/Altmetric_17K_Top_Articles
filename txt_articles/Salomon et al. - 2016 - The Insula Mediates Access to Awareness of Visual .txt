of the insula in integrating interoceptive and exteroceptive signals and in the processing of conscious signals beyond self-awareness.

Introduction
Human awareness remains one of the most profound mysteries
for science (Searle et al., 1997). Significant advances have been
made regarding the mechanisms of awareness, notably through
psychophysical and neural measures of conscious and uncon-
scious processing of visual stimuli (Dehaene and Changeux,
2011). Another line of work has linked self-awareness to the pro-
cessing of interoceptive signals in the insular cortex (i.e., cardiac
signals; Damasio, 2000; Craig, 2002; Critchley et al., 2004; Park et
al., 2014) that monitor the internal state of the body (Craig,
2009b; Singer et al., 2009; Craig, 2010). Recently, theories have
suggested that the insula may be involved in interoceptive infer-
ence in which predictions regarding interoceptive signals are
compared with actual sensory and interoceptive afferent inputs
(Critchley and Seth, 2012; Seth, 2013; Apps and Tsakiris, 2014).
These predictive models of interoception are held to mediate
widespread sensory consequences of interoceptive signals such as
cardiac activity (Barrett and Simmons, 2015), thus reducing their
influence on perception (comparable to suppression of retinal
changes due to ocular motion). Early work on cardiac effects on
cortical processing has shown a general suppression of cortical
excitability related to cardiac activity (Lacey and Lacey, 1970;

Significance Statement
There is growing evidence that interoceptive signals conveying information regarding the internal state of the body influence
perception and self-awareness. The insular cortex, which receives sensory inputs from both interoceptive and exteroceptive
sources,isthoughttointegratethesemultimodalsignals.Thisstudyshowsthatcardiacinteroceptivesignalsmodulateawareness
for visual stimuli such that visual stimuli occurring at the cardiac frequency take longer to access visual awareness and are more
difficult to discriminate. Two fMRI experiments show that the insular region is sensitive to this cardio–visual synchrony even
when the visual stimuli are rendered invisible through interocular masking. The results indicate a perceptual and neural suppres-
sion for visual events coinciding with cardiac interoceptive signals.

 Koriath and Lindholm, 1986). Others have found evidence for
cardiac related modulation of sensory and cortical processing for
cutaneous (Edwards et al., 2009; Gray et al., 2009), nociceptive
(Edwards et al., 2001; Gray et al., 2010), and emotional stimuli
(Garfinkel et al., 2014). However, studies investigating cardiac
modulation of visual perception have produced conflicting re-
sults (Elliott and Graf, 1972; Sandman et al., 1977; Walker and
Sandman, 1982; Park et al., 2014). Therefore, although intero-
ceptive signals seem important for self and bodily awareness
(Craig, 2009b; Aspell et al., 2013; Suzuki et al., 2013), their role in
other forms of awareness such as visual awareness is yet unclear.
Here, we report data from a series of behavioral and brain imag-
ing studies investigating the modulation of visual awareness by
interoceptive bodily signals in classical psychophysical tasks. We
explored the impact of interoceptive signals on visual awareness
in a series of nine separate experiments using novel adaptations of
the continuous flash suppression (CFS) (Tsuchiya and Koch,
2005) and visual crowding (Bouma, 1970) paradigms. These data
reveal an impact of interoceptive signals on visual awareness, in
which visual targets presented synchronously to the cardiac fre-
quency require more time (CFS) and are more difficult to dis-
criminate (visual crowding) than the same stimuli presented
asynchronously to the heartbeat. Two high-resolution fMRI ex-
periments show that the cardio–visual effect is reflected by insu-
lar cortex activity, thus demonstrating that the processing of
internal bodily signals in the insular cortex modulates exterocep-
tive awareness.
Materials and Methods
Participants
We recruited 153 right-handed healthy volunteers (46 females) from the
student population at E
´cole Polytechnique Fe
´de
´rale de Lausanne (EPFL)
(age 18–32 years, � � 22.2 years) for the first 7 experiments (Experiment
1, n � 31; Experiment 2, n � 18; Experiment 3, n � 23, i.e., participants
in Experiment 1 who agreed to return; Experiment 4, n � 33; Experiment
5, n � 17; Experiment 6, n � 15; Experiment 7, n � 16). Ten participants
were excluded from the analysis (Experiment 1, n � 1; Experiment 2, n �
3; Experiment 4, n � 3; Experiment 5, n � 2; Experiment 7, n � 1). Of
these 10 participants, 6 were removed due to technical failures [electrode
detachment during the experiment (4 of 6 participants); cluttered pre-
sentation of the target stimuli due to malfunction in one of the head-
mounted display (HMD) lenses (2 of 6 participants)]; the remaining four
subjects were excluded due to accuracy scores 2.5 SDs below the mean
(63%, 49%, 58%) and another one due to chance accuracy scores in the
crowding experiment (37%). Therefore, the final data for analysis in the
psychophysical experiments consisted of 143 participants. All partici-
pants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, were right-handed, had
no psychiatric or neurological history, and were naive with respect to the
purpose of the study. They participated in the study for payment (�30
Swiss Francs, CHF). All participants gave informed consent and the study
was approved by the ethics committee of EPFL.
Stimuli and procedure
Experiment 1: CFS experiment
Stimuli. Stimuli consisted of high-contrast color dynamic noise patches
suppressors (“Mondrians”) and target stimuli. The target image con-
sisted of a yellow octagon (RGB: 255,255,0; visual angle: H:4°, V:4°)
positioned either above or below a central fixation cross (RGB: 0,0,0;
visual angle: H:1°, V:1°). Mondrians were rapidly (10 Hz) flashed to the
participants’ dominant eye (visual angle: H:48°, V:36°) and the target was
presented simultaneously to the other eye. A black fixation cross (RGB:
0,0,0; visual angle: H:1°, V:1°) was presented to both eyes in all condi-
tions. Stimuli were presented using ExpyVR custom-built multimedia
stimuli presentation software developed with Python version 2.6 and the
Open Graphics Library version 2.2. The stimuli were viewed via an HMD
(VR1280; Immersion, SXGA, 60° diagonal field of view, refresh rate 60
Hz).
Heartbeat detection and online graphical animation. For the acquisition
of the ECG signal, electrodes were placed on the subjects’ chest and
plugged into a biometric analog signal amplifier (e-Health Sensor Plat-
form version 2.0; Libelium) that was assembled together with a micro-
controller (ATmega328; Arduino UNO) that performed the heartbeat
detection.
Procedure. The CFS experiment included 160 trials divided into four
blocks. The total duration of the experiment was �1 h. Each trial began
with the simultaneous presentation of the dynamic high-contrast color
patterns (“masks”) and a target image to separate eyes (Fig. 1a). The trial
ended when participants pressed a key to indicate their response or after
a maximum of 20 s. Target location (above/below fixation) and cardio–
visual synchrony (synchronous/asynchronous) were randomized. Two
different cardio–visual asynchronies were used, either 80% or 120% of
the participant’s current heartbeat, and were counterbalanced between
subjects. To ensure that trial onset did not maintain a specific phase in
relation to participants’ heartbeat, an intertrial interval of 0.5, 0.8, or 1.3 s
was presented between trials such that any spurious temporal relation
between cardiac and visual stimuli would not be maintained.
Experiment 2: CFS replication within subjects
To verify and replicate the results found in Experiment 1, we ran a second
experiment on 15 subjects in which both versions of the asynchronous
cardio–visual stimulation were used in a within-subject design. The ex-
perimental design was identical to that of the first experiment except,
here, each participant had 80 synchronous and 80 asynchronous trials of
cardio–visual stimulation (for asynchronous stimulation 40 trials were at
120% of the participant’s heartbeat and the other 40 were at 80% of their
heartbeat).
Experiment 3: heartbeat awareness
In this experiment, we tested the ability of participants to judge whether
the flashing stimuli were synchronous or asynchronous with their heart-
beat (heartbeat awareness). Twenty-three participants from the cohort of
the Experiment 1 were tested. Here, we presented the same visual stimuli
as in Experiments 1 and 2 (an octagon flashing either synchronously or
asynchronously to each participant’s heartbeat), but with no interocular
suppression, for a duration of 6 s. Participants were required to report
whether the flashing stimulus was synchronous or asynchronous to their
current heartbeat by pressing a button on the keyboard. The participants
were explicitly asked not to monitor their heartbeat by means other than
interoceptive attention (such as taking their pulse). There were 100 trials
in total (50 synchronous and 50 asynchronous randomized). The dura-
tion of the experiment was �20 min.
Experiment 4: CFS control
We used a classical CFS control experiment (Jiang et al., 2007; Salomon et
al., 2013) to control for possible differences in detection time due to
response or detection biases. The control experiment was identical to
Experiment 1 except that the target image (the yellow octagon) was
blended into the masks (Fig. 1c) and presented to both eyes. Therefore, in
the control experiment, there was no interocular suppression. Compar-
ison of the results from the control and CFS experiments allowed us to
test whether the results in the CFS experiment reflected a mere response
bias rather than a difference in conscious access.
Experiment 5: visual control
We used a visual control experiment to ensure that our results in Exper-
iments 1 and 2 were not due to any visual characteristics relating to
frequency effects of the stimulus presentation, but rather were due to
subject specific cardio–visual coupling. This experiment was identical
to Experiment 2 except that each participant in Experiment 5 was shown
the precise visual stimulation shown previously to a participant in Exper-
iment 2 (replayed) but without any relation to the participant’s own
current heartbeat. The visual stimulation was thus identical in both ex-
periments but the cardio–visual coupling was absent in Experiment 5.
Therefore, if the visual features of the stimuli (such as frequency or
timing differences) were driving the difference between synchronous and
5116 • J. Neurosci., May 4, 2016 • 36(18):5115–5127
Salomon et al. • Insular Suppression of Cardio–Visual Stimuli
 asynchronous stimuli, then we would expect the participants to show
similar differences between the trials that were synchronous and asyn-
chronous in Experiment 2.
Experiment 6: phase-shifted CFS
We next investigated whether the frequency of presentation of a visual
stimulus congruent to the heart rate was sufficient to cause visual sup-
pression or if it also had to be presented at a precise moment relative to
the heartbeat cycle. Therefore, we used the same CFS paradigm as in the
previous experiments with the target flashing at the frequency of the
participant’s heart rate in both conditions. However, in this experiment,
we modulated the phase (delay) of the visual stimulation relative to an
event of the heartbeat’s cycle. In the synchronous condition, the target
was presented at the R peak of the QRS complex, as in the synchronous
conditions of all previous experiments. In the present phase-shifted con-
dition, target presentation was delayed by a half of the heartbeat period
with respect to the R peak. Based on previous studies indicating large
temporal variability for heartbeat detection and heartbeat-evoked elec-
trophysiological responses (Brener and Kluvitse, 1988; Leopold and
Schandry, 2001; Knapp-Kline and Kline, 2005; van Elk et al., 2014a), we
predicted that the frequency synchrony rather than precise phase is the
target of cardio–visual suppression. If the visual suppression is related
only to the heartbeat’s frequency information, that is, with no consider-
ation of the phase of the stimulus relative to the heartbeat’s cycle, then we
expected to see no difference in the duration of target presentation re-
quired to break suppression in the two present conditions. However, if
visual suppression is related to the exact moment of the QRS, then the
present phase-shifted condition should show less suppression.
Experiment 7: visual crowding
To further address this issue of phase versus frequency modulation and
to test the robustness of the frequency synchronous suppression of visual
awareness, we used a novel experimental psychophysical design relying
on visual crowding (Whitney and Levi, 2011). This is a drastically differ-
ent paradigm from the previously used cardio–visual CFS paradigm be-
cause it does not depend on interocular competition and does not rely on
reaction times as a dependent measure. Rather, visual crowding involves
limits of peripheral resolution in binocular vision and is reflected by a
Figure1.

Levi, 2008; Whitney and Levi, 2011).
Stimuli and procedure. The crowding experiment included 288 trials
divided into 6 blocks and lasted �1 h. Each trial began with the simulta-
neous presentation of a H:1° by V:1° fixation cross at the top of the screen
and an array of peripheral stimuli 8.7° below. This array comprised an
0.45° by 0.6° target (letter symbols: “ ”, “ ”, or “ ”) surrounded by eight
flankers of the same size (letter symbol: “I”; center-to-center distance
between target and flankers: 0.72°, 0.91°, 1.1°, or 1.29°; see Fig. 3a). All
stimuli were displayed in black against a white background (Michelson
contrast � 1). Although the flankers were displayed with a constant
contrast, the target was flashed according to the participant’s heartbeat
(synchronous, 80–120% asynchronous, and delayed by 300 ms). The 500
ms flashing animation was done by applying a positive section of a sine
function to the transparency of the target shape. Participants were asked
to discriminate the target’s letter symbol as quickly and accurately as
possible (i.e., three alternative forced-choice task) while constantly fixat-
ing the fixation cross. Stimuli were presented for 6 s, during which par-
ticipants could provide an answer with a key press at any time. If no
response was provided at the end of this period, the 3 target letter symbols
were presented for another 2 s, during which the subject provided a
response. The target type, center-to-center distance between target and
flanker, and cardio–visual synchronicity were fully randomized. A 1 s
intertrial interval was used to avoid intertrial phase locking.
Experiment 8: high-resolution fMRI experiment without
interocular suppression
We designed two experiments using the same visual stimuli as presented
to the nondominant eye of the participants from Experiments 1 and 2: a
yellow octagon flashing above or below a fixation cross either synchro-
nously (synchronous) or in one of the two asynchronous conditions
(80% or 120%; asynchronous). However, in these experiments, the visual
stimuli were presented with no masking so the stimuli were fully visible.
The first experiment consisted of a localization task in which the subjects
had to localize the octagon as being either above or below fixation while
being uninformed of the relationship between the flashing of the target
and their heartbeat (see Fig. 4a). The naivety of the subjects to this rela-
tionship was important to avoid recording any brain activity resulting
from interoceptive attention to their heartbeat; therefore, this relation-
ship was not mentioned before this task.
The second experiment was a heartbeat awareness task. The stimuli
were identical to the localization task, but the participants were now
informed about the cardio–visual feature of the target and they had to
respond if the target was flashing synchronously or not with their heart-
beat (see Fig. 4b). This second task served as a functional localizer for the
anterior insula regions, which have been shown previously to be acti-
vated by interoceptive attention to one’s heartbeat (Critchley et al., 2004;
Wiebking et al., 2014).
Participants. Eight right-handed healthy volunteers (one female) from
the student population from Lausanne (age 20–31 years, � � 24.5 years)
were scanned. One participant was removed from the data analysis due to
motion artifacts �2 mm. All were right-handed by self-report; had a
normal or corrected-to-normal vision; no cardiac, epilepsy, or psychiat-
ric history; provided informed consent; and were paid for their partici-
pation (�30 CHF). The study was approved by the Research Ethics
Committee of EPFL.
Methods. An MR-compatible blood volume pulse (BVP) detection
sensor was placed on the middle finger of the left hand to record partic-
ipants’ real-time heartbeat (Critchley et al., 2004). Following the findings
of Experiments 6 and 7 showing that the cardio–visual suppression effect
was related to the cardiac frequency rather than phase locked to the
cardiac R peak, we used a BVP sensor in the fMRI studies. The BVP
measures heart rate through detection of blood perfusion to the dermis
and subcutaneous tissue of the skin. Pilot testing indicated that the BVP
on the fingertip was delayed by �250 ms compared with the ECG
R-wave, but that the frequency detected by the BVP and ECG systems was
identical (also see Lu et al., 2009). An MR-compatible response box
displaying two buttons was placed in the participant’s right hand. The
visual stimuli were generated using ExpyVR, projected on a screen placed
inside the bore of the scanner behind the participant’s head, and were
visible through a slanted mirror. The visual stimuli were presented bin-
ocularly and the trials followed the same procedure using an event-
related design in the localization and the heartbeat awareness tasks (see
Fig. 4a,b). Trial duration was 17.5 s; the stimuli were presented for 7.5 s,
followed by 2.5 s for the question display, followed by a rest epoch lasting
7.5 s during which a fixation cross (RGB: 233,233,233) at visual angle:
H:1°, V:1° was presented in the center of the screen. During the stimuli
presentation, the fixation cross became black (RGB: 0,0,0) and the target
(a yellow octagon; RGB: 255,255,0; visual angle: H:3°, V:3°) was flashed
either above or below the black cross (3° of vertical distance from the
cross) synchronously or asynchronously (80% or 120%) to the present
heartbeat of the subject as recorded by the BVP sensor. This was followed
by a response epoch lasting 2.5 s during which the possible responses
“above” or “below” were presented in the trials of the localization task
and “synchronous” or “asynchronous” in the trials of the heartbeat
awareness task, with an indication of which response key to press for each
choice (“up” or “down”; see Fig. 4a,b). In both the fMRI localization task
and the fMRI heartbeat awareness task, there were 24 trials per run and
each run was repeated twice with the synchronous and asynchronous
conditions presented in a random order. Each run had a duration of
420 s.
Scanning parameters. The MRI scanner was a 7T Siemens with a 32-
channel Tx/Rx rf-coil (Nova Medical) (Salomon et al., 2014). The func-
tional runs were acquired using echo-planar images of 34 axial slices (1.3
mm isotropic voxels with no gap) placed over the insular cortex (matrix
size 160 � 160, FOV 210 mm, TE � 27 ms, TR � 2.5 s, GRAPPA 2; see
Fig. 4d). Each functional run comprised 168 volumes and lasted 420 s (7
min). The anatomical run was acquired using the MP2RAGE sequence
(Marques et al., 2010; TE � 2.63 ms, TR � 7.2 ms, TI1 � 0.9 s, TI2 �
3.2 s, TR � 5 s) and lasted �7 min.
Data analysis. fMRI data were analyzed using the “Brain-voyager”
software package (Brain Innovation) and complementary in-house soft-
ware. The echo-planar images acquired during the functional runs were
corrected for low frequencies (e.g., due to cardiac and breathing artifacts)
and 3D motion and were then transformed to the native space of the
anatomical run. The data of all participants were not transformed into a
standardized space but rather were analyzed separately to benefit from
the high spatial resolution offered by the 7T scanner. A general linear
model (GLM) analysis was performed using a design matrix containing
one regressor for the fixation epochs, one for the presentation of syn-
chronous targets, one for asynchronous targets, one for the response
epochs, and six additional ones taking into account the 3D motion cor-
rections. Because respiration signals were not available, they were not
regressed from the functional data. All regressors were modeled as boxcar
functions convolved with a hemodynamic response function. Clusters of
positive BOLD activity were used during the presentation of the stimuli
(Synchronous � Asynchronous � Rest contrast) in the heartbeat aware-
ness task as localizers to select the regions of interest (ROIs) further used
in the statistical analysis of the localization task. Noninsular brain regions
activated by the localizer were analyzed to investigate whether the result
obtained in the anterior insula was specific or if it was also found in other
brain regions. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), right posterior supe-
rior temporal gyrus (rSTG), and occipital visual regions were consis-
tently activated and were selected as ROIs for each subject (at p � 0.001
FDR).
ROIs in the right and the left anterior insula were selected manually for
each subject using a p-value threshold of p � 0.001 (FDR corrected).
Other regions consistently activated in the localizer, such as ACC, rSTG,
and occipital cortex, were also selected using the same threshold. The
BOLD activity in the selected ROIs during the stimuli presentation of the
localization task was further analyzed by means of an event-related aver-
aging analysis. To determine the difference between these responses, the
BOLD percentage signal change responses were averaged for the syn-
chronous and asynchronous epochs corresponding to the two data
points of the peak of the BOLD response (7.5–10 s) as well as the full time
course. A repeated-measures ANOVA on the mean BOLD signal with
side (left/right) and cardio–visual synchrony (synchronous/asynchro-
nous) as within-subject factors was used to explore the effects of the
5118 • J. Neurosci., May 4, 2016 • 36(18):5115–5127
Salomon et al. • Insular Suppression of Cardio–Visual Stimuli
 laterality of the anterior insula (right vs left) and the synchrony condi-
tions (synchronous vs asynchronous) of the presented visual stimuli. To
supplement the BOLD time course analysis, a ROI-GLM approach was
used. ROI-GLM analysis was then applied to each of the ROIs (anterior
insulae and other activated regions) independently using one predictor
for synchronous trials and another one for asynchronous trials, as well as
the motion predictors as nuisance regressors. The values of the two pre-
dictors during the localization task were then compared with a t test for
each ROI. To test for possible effects of cardiac activity on the results, the
cardiac signal was regressed out using the RETROICOR approach
(Glover et al., 2000). Using the BVP signal, the six cardiac specific regres-
sors created by the RETROICOR toolbox were used used as control
covariates in our design matrix. The data were then reanalyzed after the
regression of the cardiac signals as described above.
Experiment 9: High-resolution fMRI experiment with CFS
In the second fMRI experiment, we presented the same visual stimuli as
in Experiment 1 and 2: masks to the dominant eye and a yellow octagon
flashing above or below a fixation cross either synchronously (synchro-
nous) or in one of the two asynchronous conditions (80% or 120%;
asynchronous) to the other eye. We used a method for dichoptic presen-
tation of visual stimuli inside of the 7T MRI scanner (Schurger, 2009).
In the first experiment (CFS localization task), the participants were
presented with the cardio–visual stimuli but were not able to see them
consciously because they were suppressed by the dynamic high-contrast
patterns presented simultaneously to their dominant eye. The second
experiment was identical to the heartbeat awareness task of the first fMRI
experiment and served the same purpose of functionally locating the
anterior insula ROIs.
Participants. Nine right-handed healthy volunteers (two females; age:
22–27 years, � � 24.6 years) were scanned. Participants were otherwise
similar to those of Experiment 8. One participant was removed from the
data analysis due to motion artifacts �2 mm.
Methods. The subjects were provided with a tailored pair of prism
glasses to wear inside the scanner and a piece of black-covered cardboard
was used to separate the visual stream of each eye from the back of their
head to the screen behind them to enable a dichoptic presentation of the
stimuli. Trial duration was 24 s: after a 6 s fixation epoch, the stimuli were
presented for 6 s. There were 2 s to respond to each of the 2 questions,
which was followed by a rest epoch lasting 6 s. During rest, a fixation cross
(RGB: 0,0,0; visual angle: H:1°, V:1°) was presented in the center of the
field of view of both eyes (see Fig. 4c). During the stimulus presentation,
dynamic high-contrast masks were displayed to the dominant eye (visual
angle: H:20°, V:10°) and the target (yellow octagon; RGB: 255,255,0;
visual angle: H:3°, V:3°) was flashed either above or below the fixation
cross (3° of vertical distance from the cross) to the nondominant eye
synchronously or asynchronously (80% or 120%) to the present heart-
beat of the subjects as calculated by the BVP sensor. This was followed by
a first response epoch lasting 2 s, during which the possible responses
“yes” or “no” were displayed, implying the question “Did you see a yellow
octagon?” The second response epoch lasted 2 s, during which the words
“above” or “below” were displayed, prompting the participants to re-
spond to the question “Was the octagon above or below the fixation
cross?” There were 32 trials in each run and each run was repeated twice
with the synchronous and asynchronous conditions presented in a ran-
dom order. Each run had a duration of 768 s. The heartbeat awareness
task took place exactly in the same way as in the first fMRI experiment,
with the stimuli sizes adapted to the CFS setup.
Scanning parameters. The same 7T MRI-scanner as in Experiment 8
was used and the functional runs were acquired using echo-planar im-
ages of 34 axial slices (1.8 mm isotropic voxels with no gap) placed to
comprise the primary visual cortex (V1), the insular cortex, and as much
of the superior parietal cortex as possible (matrix size 160 � 160, FOV
210 mm, TE � 27 ms, TR � 2.0 s, GRAPPA 2). Each functional run
comprised 384 volumes and lasted 12.8 min.
Data analysis. Trials in which the participants reported to have seen
the yellow octagon (first question) were discarded. The same analysis as
in fMRI Experiment 8 was then performed. The “Synchronous � Asyn-
chronous � Rest” contrast (p � 0.05, FDR corrected) was used in the
heartbeat awareness task to locate the anterior insula and control ROIs
functionally. The laterality (left/right) and synchronicity (synchronous/
asynchronous) effects of the BOLD activation in the unconscious task
were then investigated on these ROIs and the other regions activated by
the localizer (ACC, rSTG, and occipital cortex) by repeated-measures
ANOVA and t tests. A similar ROI-GLM analysis as before was per-
formed here. Once again, possible effects of cardiac activity on the results
were tested for by regressing out the cardiac signal using the RETROI-
COR approach (Glover et al., 2000) as described for Experiment 8.
Data analysis: all experiments
For all experiments, accuracy and response time were measured. Accu-
racy was computed as the percentage of trials in which the location of the
octagon was reported correctly. The main dependent measure was the
duration of the target presentation (the yellow octagon) required to
break suppression. Because heart rate showed considerable variability
both within (SD range 1–12 BPM, mean � � 3.7) and between (� � 12.4)
participants, this measure was used because it normalized the data with
respect to the within- and between-subject variance for heart rate. The
duration of target presentation was recorded as the total time the visual
stimulus was presented on the screen when the participants indicated
that they had seen the stimulus. Only correct trials were analyzed. For
each participant, trials in which the reaction time exceeded 2.5 SDs from
the participant’s mean were defined as outliers and excluded from fur-
ther analyses (total loss 5.2% of trials). For all CFS experiments (Exper-
iments 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6), a t test was used to compare the mean accuracy
and target presentation duration for synchronous and asynchronous tri-
als. Null effects were assessed using Bayes factor (BF) tests with default
prior scales (Rouder et al., 2009) using JASP (version 0.7.11). The BF
allows assessment of the likelihood of the results based on the Bayesian
prior. Therefore, a BF of �0.33 implies substantial evidence for the null
hypothesis because it is 3 times more likely than the alternative hypoth-
esis, 0.33 � BF � 3 suggests insensitivity of the data, and BF � 3 implies
substantial evidence for the alternative hypothesis. Heartbeat data from
all experiments were extracted from the ECG recording and analyzed
using t tests.
Results
Suppression of synchronous cardio–visual stimuli: CFS
In the first experiment, we found that interoception modulated
visual awareness as synchronous cardio–visual stimuli took lon-
ger presentation durations to reach visual awareness (� � 3.6 s,
� � 1.2) compared with asynchronous cardio–visual ones (� �
3.4 s, � � 1.05, t(29) � 2, p � 0.02, Cohen’s d� � 0.38; Fig. 2a).
This result provides empirical evidence for a direct influence of
the heartbeat on visual awareness (Experiment 1).
To ensure the robustness of the present heartbeat effect on
visual awareness, we repeated the experiment in a new group of
participants using a within-subject design (Experiment 2; Fig.
1b). Once again, synchronous cardio–visual stimulation required
more time to break suppression than asynchronous stimulation
(t(14) � 3.5, p � 0.008, Cohen’s d� � 0.65; Fig. 2b).
We next tested whether our participants were able to discrim-
inate the synchrony between the flashing stimuli and their
heartbeat to assess whether explicit perception of cardio–visual
synchrony could have confounded our data. To assess the partic-
ipants’ interoceptive awareness, we conducted Experiment 3, in
which we presented the same visual stimuli (flashing either syn-
chronously or asynchronously to each participant’s heartbeat) to
both eyes (without any suppression), for a duration of 6 s. On
each trial, participants were asked to indicate whether the stimu-
lus was synchronized to their heartbeat. The results showed that
participants were at chance for judging cardio–visual synchrony
even when the flashing visual stimuli were fully visible (� � 52.8
� � 13.1, t(22) � 1.03, n.s., BF � 0.22), suggesting substantial
evidence for the null hypothesis (one-sample t test vs 50% chance

 value). We investigated this further by correlating the interocep-
tive awareness accuracy scores with the cardio–visual suppres-
sion effects from the same subjects in Experiment 1. No
correlation was found between these scores (r � �0.14, p � 0.52,
n.s.). A Bayesian Pearson correlation indicated a BF � 0.31,
which implies substantial evidence for the null hypothesis.
Therefore, these data indicate that explicit perception of cardio–
visual synchrony was unlikely to underlie the present cardio–
visual suppression effect. To ensure that the cardio–visual effect
on visual awareness was not caused by a response or detection
bias (e.g., faster responses for asynchronous stimuli after stimuli
became aware), we further conducted a classical CFS control ex-
periment (Jiang et al., 2007; Salomon et al., 2013) (Experiment 4),
inwhichthesamestimuliwerepresentedtobotheyeswiththetarget
superimposedonthepatternedmasks,thusnotinducinganyintero-
cularsuppression(Fig.1c).PerformanceinExperiment4showedno
difference between the synchronous and asynchronous cardio–vi-
sual stimulation (t(29) � 0.27, p � 0.39, BF � 0.34).
In addition, to ensure that the difference between synchro-
nous and asynchronous cardio–visual stimulation was not due to
subtle visual differences in the frequency of stimulation between
the synchronous and asynchronous conditions, we conducted a
fifth experiment (Experiment 5). Here, new subjects were shown
the exact same visual stimuli that were presented to participants
of Experiment 2 so that the stimuli were shown as temporally
decoupled from their heartbeats (i.e., subjects in Experiment 5
saw stimuli that were recorded from other participants in Exper-
iment 2). We reasoned that, if the difference between the syn-
chronous and asynchronous conditions found in Experiments 1
and 2 was driven by basic visual differences (e.g., stimulation
frequency) rather than by cardio–visual coupling, then such dif-
ferences should also be found in Experiment 5 because the visual
stimuli were identical apart from their decoupling from the car-
diac signal. The results showed that, when the visual stimuli were
coupled to the subjects’ heartbeat, the suppression effect was sig-
nificantly larger (t(14) � 2.69, p � 0.01) than when it was not
coupled to the subjects heartbeat. Furthermore, when decoupled
(Experiment 5), no differences between visual stimuli that were
“synchronous” or “asynchronous” to the heartbeat in Experi-
ment 2 (t(14) � 1.2, p � 0.12, BF � 0.5) were found and the
suppression effect was not different from 0 (t(14) � 1.23, p � 0.23,
BF � 0.5). These BFs suggest that the results are inconclusive
regarding the null or alternative hypothesis. Therefore, the same
visual stimulation shown to the participants of Experiment 2, but
without any cardio–visual coupling, did not induce significant
differences in CFS between synchronous and asynchronous car-
dio–visual stimulation found for the same stimuli presented in
Experiment 2 while coupled to the heartbeat. Furthermore, if the
visual stimuli themselves rather than cardio–visual coupling were
driving the effect, then we would expect the suppression effect
(i.e., the synchronous–asynchronous difference) to be correlated
between the participants of Experiment 2 and Experiment 5 be-
cause they experienced the identical visual stimulation. Subject-
by-subject correlation analysis, however, did not indicate any
significant correlation (r � 0.26, p � 0.34). This indicates that
cardio–visual effects on CFS (Experiments 1 and 2) depend on
cardio–visual coupling and not on visual differences between
synchronous and asynchronous visual stimulation.
We next sought to test whether the suppression of synchro-
nous cardio–visual stimuli was phase-selective (i.e., locked to a
specific delay after the R-wave) or if it would occur for visual
stimuli that were at the same frequency of the heart but occurred
at different phases of the cardiac cycle. To this end, we conducted
a further CFS experiment (Experiment 6) in which the visual
stimuli were either synchronous to the participants’ heartbeat
or delayed (by half a phase) while maintaining the same fre-
quency. The results of Experiment 6 confirmed our predic-
tions as there was no significant difference in the duration
required to detect synchronous (� � 5.5 s, � � 1.7) versus
delayed phase-shifted (� � 5.5 s, � � 1.6; t(14) � 0.036, n.s.,
BF � 0.25, i.e., suggesting substantial evidence for the null
hypothesis) cardio–visual stimuli.
Suppression of synchronous cardio–visual stimuli:
visual crowding
Next, we sought to exclude the possibility that the influence of
cardiac-interoceptive signals on visual awareness was specific to
the CFS task and determine whether the effect was a more general

 phenomenon that also extended to other stimulation conditions.
We relied on visual crowding (Experiment 7), a drastically differ-
ent paradigm. Compared with CFS, which stems from interocu-
lar competition and relies on reaction time as a dependent
measure, crowding is due to limits of visual discrimination in
peripheral vision and is reflected by changes in accuracy measures
(Whitney and Levi, 2011). While constantly fixating at the top of
the screen, participants were presented with a letter-shaped visual
target that was surrounded by an array of eight similar flankers at
the bottom of the screen (Fig. 3a). The presence of flanking dis-
tractors causes the central target stimulus to be difficult to recog-
nize. Although the flankers were displayed constantly, the target
was flashed either synchronously or asynchronously with respect
to the participants’ heartbeat frequency and phase. An additional
condition in which the frequency was synchronous but the visual
stimulus was delayed by 300 ms (constant delay condition) was
also included to further test the effect of frequency versus phase-
related cardio–visual signals. Participants were asked to discrim-
inate the target (three-alternative forced choice task). As
predicted (based on our CFS results), we found that cardio–visual
stimulation affected the discrimination of crowded stimuli: accu-
racy was lower for stimuli presented synchronously with respect
to the heartbeat (accuracy for the smallest center-to-center dis-
tance: � � 56.1 vs � � 69.4, t(14) � 3.93, p � 0.0007, Cohen’s d�
� 1.1; Fig. 3b). No effect on reaction times was found. This ex-
periment also provided additional evidence regarding the sup-
pression of frequency-shifted, but not phase-shifted stimuli
because the accuracy for the phase delay condition was signifi-
cantly lower than that for the asynchronous condition (t(14) �
2.3, p � 0.05) and did not differ from the synchronous condition
(t(14)�-0.22, n.s., BF � 0.86, i.e., inconclusive regarding the null
or alternative hypothesis), replicating the findings of Experiment
6. Previous results have shown that cardiac awareness is modu-
lated by increased cardiac activity (Khalsa et al., 2009). To assess
whether the heart rate per se had any effect on the cardio–visual
suppression effect, we compared effect sizes between participants
with higher heart rates and lower heart rates based on a median
split. Two-sample t tests indicated no differences in the cardio–
visual suppression effects sizes as a func-
tion of high versus low heart rates in any
of the experiments (Experiment 1, p �
0.25, BF � 0.57; Experiment 2, p � 0.82,
BF � 0.47; Experiment 7, p � 0.87, BF �
0.44; BF were inconclusive regarding the
null or alternative hypothesis).
Our results (Experiments 1 and 2)
show that visual stimuli presented syn-
chronously with one’s heartbeat take
more time to break suppression and enter
visual awareness compared with stimuli
presented asynchronously to the heart-
beat. These results indicate that the car-
diac rhythm affects how an external visual
stimulus gains access to awareness. This
effect is not related to explicit heartbeat
awareness (Experiment 3) or to a response
or detection bias (Experiment 4) and is
induced by subject-specific cardio–visual
coupling and not any other information
contained in the visual stimuli (Experi-
ment 5). Importantly, we also found that
this suppression extends to stimuli pre-
sented at the same frequency but phase
shifted (Experiments 6 and 7) and that this effect is not depen-
dent on interocular competition mechanisms or reaction time
measures because it was also found in accuracy measures in the
visual crowing experiment (Experiment 7).
These data show that cardiac interoceptive signals affect visual
awareness. We argue that the present findings are compatible
with predictive coding between the interoceptive and the visual
system. Previous work has shown attenuation (or suppression) of
sensory consequences for self-generated arm or eye movements
(Guthrie et al., 1983; Blakemore et al., 1998; Shergill et al., 2013).
The present data indicate that “self-generated” cardiac move-
ments (i.e., heartbeats) are also associated with suppression of
exteroceptive sensory consequences (i.e., visual signals) even if
artificially produced and rarely encountered in everyday life.
Our data point to the frequency of the cardiac cycle, which is
identical for all afferent and efferent signals relating to cardiac
information as the target for predictive suppression of these
sensory consequences.
Neural suppression of seen synchronous cardio–visual
stimuli: fMRI
We next wanted to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying
such cardio–visual stimulation. A prime candidate region re-
sponsible for suppressing such signals is the insular cortex be-
cause of the following: (1) it is involved in the processing of
interoceptive information including cardiac signals (Craig, 2002;
Critchley et al., 2004), (2) it is involved in the the comparison of
auditory and cardiac signals (Critchley et al., 2004), and (3) it has
recently been hypothesized as a site for multimodal integration
and sensory prediction related to the self (Critchley and Seth,
2012; Seth, 2013). We therefore predicted that this region would
respond differently depending on the synchrony of cardio–visual
stimulation. We used high-resolution fMRI at 7T (see Materials
and Methods for full information concerning Experiment 8) and
tested whether activity in the insular cortex reflects differences
between synchronous and asynchronous cardio–visual stimula-
tion. Regions sensitive to interoceptive attention were localized
using an independent functional localizer task (Fig. 4b) adapted

 from an interoceptive attention task (Critchley et al., 2004)
known to activate the anterior insula region. Several regions were
consistently activated during the interoceptive attention task in-
cluding the bilateral anterior insulae, ACC, rSTG, and occipital
visual regions (p � 0.001, FDR corrected). In the main experi-
ment, 8 participants viewed an unmasked octagon flashing syn-
chronously or asynchronously to their heartbeat and were asked
to report its location (i.e., above or below fixation; Fig. 4a). This
task was always performed before the localizer task to ensure that
participants were naive to the purpose of Experiment 8. Estimat-
ing the mean BOLD signal response in the left and right anterior
insulae (as defined above) for the synchronous and asynchronous
cardio–visual conditions, we found that insula activation was
weaker during synchronous than asynchronous cardio–visual
stimulation (F(1,6) � 17.7, p � 0.005), compatible with suppres-
sion of visually induced activation in the insula depending on
cardio–visual synchrony (Fig. 5a: single representative subject;
Fig. 5b: group data). Analysis of other regions activated by the
interoceptive task (ACC, rSTG, occipital cortex) showed no dif-
ference between the synchronous and asynchronous cardio–vi-
sual stimulation (Fig. 6). Regressing out the cardiac signal using
the RETROICOR approach (Glover et al., 2000) did not affect the
results. The difference between the BOLD activity in the anterior
insulae between synchronous and asynchronous conditions was
significant (F(1,6) � 18.4, p � 0.005), with no difference between
the left and right insulae (F(1,6) � 1.3, n.s.). This suggests that the
results in the anterior insulae are independent of vascular fluctu-
ations and are more likely to reflect neuron-related BOLD
changes. Furthermore, these results show that the insula is sensi-
tive to cardio–visual synchrony, as characterized by a decreased
activation during synchronous cardio–visual stimulation.
Neural suppression of unseen synchronous cardio–visual
stimuli: fMRI
We next wanted to test whether this insular suppression of BOLD
activity extends to cases in which the visual stimulus is rendered
invisible, as was the case in our CFS experiments. To this end, we
used an MRI-compatible CFS system (Schurger, 2009) and pre-
sented participants with stimuli identical to those of the first
imaging experiment except that they were rendered fully invisible
by CFS (see Materials and Methods for further details; Fig. 4c).
CFS successfully rendered the visual stimuli invisible (as deter-
mined by subjective and objective measures). We restricted our
analysis to trials in which the participants were fully unaware of
the visual stimuli (78.6% of trials). Even when the visual stimuli
were rendered fully invisible through CFS, we found lower acti-
vations in the anterior insulae for synchronous compared with
asynchronous stimuli (F(1,7) � 9.3, p � 0.018; see Fig. 7a for a
single representative subject and Fig. 7b for group data). There-
fore, we replicated the findings of the first fMRI experiment in an
Figure 4.

 independent subject sample and extended this finding to unseen
cardio–visual stimuli. Importantly, this effect was robust and sta-
ble in 14 of the 15 present fMRI participants, showing lower
BOLD activity in the synchronous condition in the right anterior
insula. This provides important support for the role of the ante-
rior insula in unconscious processing of cardio–visual stimuli. To
ensure further that the suppression effect was only found in the
insula, we analyzed control regions as in the first fMRI experi-
ment, which showed no differential activity between the two car-
dio–visual conditions. After regressing out the cardiac signal, the
difference between synchronous and asynchronous conditions in
the insulae was significant (F(1,7) � 6.4, p � 0.039), with no
difference between the left and right insulae (F(1,7) � 0.008, n.s.).
Discussion
Collectively, the present data show that interoceptive signals of
cardiac origin modulate access to visual awareness. Visual stimuli
presented synchronously to the cardiac frequency required lon-
ger presentations to reach awareness (CFS: Experiments 1 and 2)
and were discriminated with lower accuracy (crowding: Experi-
ment 7). Control experiments indicated that this effect is inde-
pendent of explicit heartbeat awareness (Experiment 3), not due
to a response or detection bias (Experiment 4), and is induced by
subject-specific cardio–visual coupling (Experiment 5). Impor-
tantly, we found that this suppression extends to stimuli pre-
sented at the same frequency but phase-shifted compared with
the periodic heartbeat (Experiments 6 and 7). High-resolution
imaging indicated that insular cortex showed decreased BOLD
activation in response to both visible (Experiment 8) and invisi-
ble (Experiment 9) visual stimuli that were synchronous to the
participants’ heartbeat.
We suggest that this effect is due to the conflicting require-
ments of monitoring the heartbeat while minimizing its effects on
perception. The heartbeat is a lifelong and critical signal for the
organism, which must be monitored continuously and kept
within tight limits to avoid, for example, arrhythmia or asystolia;
such monitoring, in most instances, occurs outside of awareness
because one does not experience control over one’s heart. How-
ever, our heartbeat also produces widespread sensory conse-
quences in the tactile, proprioceptive, auditory, and visual
domains. For example, the heartbeat affects tactile afferent out-
put (Macefield, 2003), muscle spindle discharge (Birznieks et al.,
2012), and generates mechanical effects on the eyes modulating
interocular pressure and eye movements (de Kinkelder et al.,
2011). Suppression of the sensory consequences related to these
cardiac effects is thus desired for an accurate perception of exter-
nal stimuli. Comparable to suppression of the consequences of
our actions in tactile (Blakemore et al., 1998; Bays et al., 2006;
Shergill et al., 2013), auditory (McGuire et al., 1995; Baess et al.,
2009; van Elk et al., 2014b), and visual domains (Volkmann et al.,
1980; Guthrie et al., 1983), we propose that the present effects of
the heartbeat on visual awareness reflect a basic and likely predic-
tive mechanism to suppress the “self-generated” sensory conse-
quences of the heartbeat from awareness. The present effect is
consistent with suggested interoceptive predictive mechanisms
(Seth et al., 2011; Seth, 2013; Barrett and Simmons, 2015), pre-
dicting the sensory consequences of interoceptive activity and
reducing its effects on perception.
Although CFS techniques have been used extensively to inves-
tigate unconscious processing (Jiang et al., 2007; Faivre et al.,
2014; Salomon et al., 2015a; Salomon et al., 2015b), the breaking
CFS measure as a proxy for conscious access has been criticized
recently (Stein et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2014). It has been proposed
that the typical control condition in which no interocular sup-
pression is used and no difference in suppression is found may be

 insufficient to rule out that differences in reaction times are due
to postperceptual processes. In the current study, however, the
breaking CFS paradigms were supplemented with an additional
psychophysical method of visual crowding (Experiment 7),
which allowed us to replicate our finding in the accuracy domain,
thus circumventing the possible limitations of time to emergence
used with the CFS method. Furthermore, using Bayesian statistics
to complement nonsignificant effects, we found a BF of 0.34 for
the CFS control experiment (Experiment 4), which indicates that
the null effect is nearly three times as likely as the alternative
hypothesis. Finally, we found cortical suppression effects under
full suppression, in which the participants are completely un-
aware of the stimuli, independently of time to emergence mea-
sures. Therefore, by using multiple paradigms, Bayesian statistics,
and full-suppression methods, we are confident that our finding
is independent of possible confounds related to time to emer-
gence measures.
Interoceptive information regarding cardiac activity is con-
veyed by several afferent sources, including cardiac and somato-
sensory mechanoreceptors as well as blood vessel baroreceptors
(Knapp and Brener, 1998), and is affected by several cardiac fac-
tors (Schandry et al., 1993). Previous investigations of cardiac

Salomon et al. • Insular Suppression of Cardio–Visual Stimuli
 influences on behavior and neural processing have focused on
specific epochs of the cardiac cycle (e.g., systole vs diastole) and
have been successful in showing cardiac effects on somatosensory
(Edwards et al., 2009; Gray et al., 2009), nociceptive (Edwards et
al., 2001; McIntyre et al., 2006; Edwards et al., 2008; Gray et al.,
2010), and emotional (Gray et al., 2007; Gray et al., 2012; Garfin-
kel et al., 2014) processing. Importantly, these afferent signals
have variable delays in respect to the R-wave, as shown by previ-
ous studies on heartbeat awareness (Brener et al., 1993; Ring and
Brener, 1996) and heart-related neural activity (Leopold and
Schandry, 2001; van Elk et al., 2014a). In contrast, the frequency
of cardiac-related effects is identical across all afferent inputs.
Here, we extend the aforementioned findings and show behav-
ioral and neural suppression for visual targets synchronous to the
participants’ cardiac frequency. Although the heartbeat is a peri-
odic signal, its sensory consequences differ in their temporal de-
lay as a function of the distance from the heart. Accordingly, a
predictive model (Seth et al., 2011; Brown et al., 2013) based on
the frequency but regardless of the phase of the cardiac cycle
could be effective for the suppression of its sensory consequences
no matter where they occur compared with the heart. Consistent
with this view, a previous study investigating the neural suppres-
sion of cardiac-related auditory stimuli indicated auditory sup-
pression depending on cardiac frequency but not cardiac phase
(van Elk et al., 2014a). Therefore, the present results indicate a
role for cardiac frequency in the attenuation of the sensory con-
sequences of interoceptive signals (see Aspell et al., 2013; Suzuki
et al., 2013 for frequency-based effects on behavior).
At the neural level, our data show that the insular cortex is
sensitive to the synchronicity of visual and cardiac signals for
both visible and invisible visual stimuli. This region is thought to
enable the convergence of interoceptive and exteroceptive signals
(Craig, 2002; Critchley et al., 2004; Wiebking et al., 2014) and has
recently also been proposed to underlie self-awareness (Damasio,
2000; Craig, 2009b; Craig, 2010; Apps and Tsakiris, 2014) and
exteroceptive multisensory bodily perception and movement
control in healthy and neurological patients (Karnath et al., 2005;
Heydrich and Blanke, 2013). These results converge in suggesting
the possible role of the insula for multimodal predictive coding
(Singer et al., 2009; Seth et al., 2011; Apps and Tsakiris, 2014) and
salience processing (Seeley et al., 2007). The current findings fur-
ther suggest that the anterior insular cortex may constitute a site
for multimodal integration of internal and external sensory sig-
nals through interoceptive predictions (Seth et al., 2011; Brown et
al., 2013; Seth and Critchley, 2013; Barrett and Simmons, 2015).
We propose that these predictive mechanisms allow suppressing
the sensory consequences of cardiac activity by integrating inter-
nal somatic states with external sensory information (Craig,
2002; Critchley et al., 2004; Preuschoff et al., 2008).
Although the data are consistent with interoceptive predictive
coding accounts in the anterior insular cortex, we cannot rule out
other possible interpretations of the findings. The insular cortex
has been found to be activated by a wide range of perceptual and
cognitive processes (Kurth et al., 2010). The anterior insula has
been implicated in temporal processing (Craig, 2009a; Wiener et
al., 2010), which has been suggested to relate to its role in inte-
grating internal interoceptive temporal cues with external signals
(Wittmann, 2009; Wittmann et al., 2010). Indeed, the anterior
insula has been activated in studies investigating temporal syn-
chrony (Bushara et al., 2001) and the sense of agency and error
monitoring that require matching exteroceptive sensory signals
with self-generated actions (Menon et al., 2001; Klein et al., 2007;
Karnath and Baier, 2010; Sperduti et al., 2011; Klein et al., 2013).
Therefore, it is possible that the observed increased anterior in-
sular activation by asynchronous cardio–visual stimuli reflects
sensitivity to the temporal disparity between the visual stimulus

 and the cardiac frequency regardless of predictive mechanisms.
Further experiments including manipulation of prior expecta-
tions are required to ascertain whether interoceptive predictive
coding in the anterior insula underlies the reported effect.
In conclusion, the results of the present series of psychophys-
ical experiments show that awareness for visual events is sup-
pressed if they are synchronized to the heartbeat. Neuroimaging
data indicate an important role for the insula in this suppression,
which is consistent with its suggested role in multimodal predic-
tive coding. These results demonstrate that the processing of in-
teroceptive bodily signals in the insula has systematic effects on
our conscious experience of the world.
