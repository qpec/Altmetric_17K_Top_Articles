Abstract
Genetic, dietary, and inflammatory factors contribute to the etiology of major mood disorders (MMD), thus impeding
the identification of specific biomarkers to assist in diagnosis and treatment. We tested association of vitamin D and
inflammatory markers in 36 adolescents with bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) forms of
MMD and without MMD (non-mood control). We also assessed the overall level of inflammation using a cell-based
reporter assay for nuclear factor kappa-B (NFκB) activation and measuring antibodies to oxidized LDL. We found that
these factors were similar between non-mood and MMD youth. To identify potential biomarkers, we developed a
screening immunoprecipitation-sequencing approach based on inflammatory brain glia maturation factor beta
(GMFβ). We discovered that a homolog of GMFβ in human plasma is vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) and validated
this finding using immunoprecipitation with anti-DBP antibodies and mass spectrometry/sequencing analysis. We
quantified DBP levels in participants by western blot. DBP levels in BD participants were significantly higher (136%)
than in participants without MMD (100%). The increase in DBP levels in MDD participants (121.1%) was not statistically
different from these groups. The DBP responds early to cellular damage by binding of structural proteins and
activating inflammatory cells. A product of enzymatic cleavage of DBP has been described as macrophage-activating
factor. Circulating DBP is comprised of heterogenous high and low molecular fractions that are only partially
recognized by mono- and polyclonal ELISA and are not suitable for the quantitative comparison of DBP in non-mood
and MDD participants. Our data suggest DBP as a marker candidate of BD warranting its validation in a larger cohort of
adolescent and adult MMD patients.
Introduction
Major mood disorders (MMD), specifically bipolar dis-
order (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD), are
some of the most prevalent albeit under-diagnosed health
problems in children and adolescents1,2. Worldwide
among adolescents, MDD and BD are the first and fourth
most disabling conditions, respectively3. High mortality in
adults with MDD and BD is attributed to suicide and
cardiovascular-related disorders4. Currently, there is an
estimated 10-year delay between onset of BD and accurate
diagnosis5 because robust biomarkers for MMD have not
been identified.
Biomarker discovery is impeded due to the insufficient
understanding of the underlying etiology and pathophy-
siology of MMD6. Pathophysiology of BD has been
attributed to deficits in serotonin7. Microglia macro-
phages produce and sense serotonin in response to
proinflammatory cytokines in the brain and peripheral

 nervous system7. MDD has been associated with a
reduction in glial cell counts and density compared to
healthy controls8. In contrast, activated microglia release
proinflammatory
cytokines
in
BD,
thereby,
exerting
negative effects on the neuroprotective system and med-
iating
further
pathophysiological
disturbances9.
Glia
maturation factor beta (GMFβ), which is expressed in
cerebral astrocytes, activates the microglia10. Activated
microglia release proinflammatory cytokines, which exert
negative effects on the neuroprotective system and med-
iate further pathophysiological disturbances related to
BD9. These disturbances include alterations in synaptic
function as well as in apoptosis, excitotoxicity, and
downregulation in neurogenesis and neurotrophin pro-
duction9,11. It still unclear what processes trigger inflam-
mation in the brain, but inflammatory signaling in the
kynurenine pathway, an alternate route of tryptophan
metabolism that decreases serotonin neurotransmission,
as well as activation of the enzyme glycogen synthase
kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β) in the Wnt pathway, and activa-
tion of cyclooxygenase 2 and arachidonic acid appear to
be involved11.
Given that inflammation influences abnormalities in glia
and neuronal plasticity7, systemic inflammation has also
been proposed as a mechanism or a result of MMD
depending on etiologies9,12–14. Elevated cytokine levels in
peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and altered
inflammatory activity are found in those with MMD
compared to non-depressed individuals12,13. Specifically,
tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) is higher in adult
patients with MDD15. Cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-
4, IL-6, and IL-8, are also reportedly altered in patients
with MDD16,17. The elevated levels of proinflammatory
cytokines in patients with MDD, who are otherwise
healthy, suggest a likely link between depressive illness
and dysregulation of the inflammatory response15,18,19. In
addition to elevated proinflammatory cytokines, BD is
also associated with hyperactivity of T-helper cell 1,
with significantly higher levels in BD patients during
manic and depressive episodes as compared to non-BD
controls12,20,21.
Nuclear factor kappa-B (NFκB) is a key transcription
factor in the regulation of increased expression of proin-
flammatory cytokines and neuroendocrine responses to
stress22,23. Hyperactivation of NFκB in BD is also thought
to be a protective mechanism against the neurotoxic
effects of repeated illness episodes22,24. Despite the evi-
dence that the inflammatory cascade is regulated by
activation of NFκB23,25,26, few studies have examined
NFκB regulation in MMD in pediatric-onset MDD or
BD22. Manifestations of inflammation in studies of youth
with MMD vary, and to date no robust marker predicting
onset of MMD in an adolescent population has been
reported.
The relatively new field of psychiatric nutrition has
highlighted a relationship between diet and the mental
health status of children and adolescents27–31. Vitamin D
has been shown to influence inflammation-dependent
disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) in multiple
sclerosis32,33, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis34, and MMD35.
Gracious et al.36 reported an association between vitamin
D deficiency in adolescents and severity of mental illness.
A pilot study of youth with BD documented both
improvement of manic and depressive symptoms and
normalization of brain neurochemistry via neuroimaging
following an 8-week open-label trial of 2000 IU of vitamin
D337. Vitamin D may participate in the regulation of brain
function, as vitamin D receptors (VDR) are present in
large amounts in the CNS and in the developing and
mature human brain38,39. Vitamin D is transported by
vitamin D-binding protein (DBP), but little is known
about its role in the CNS. DBP is expressed in the rat40
and possibly in human brain41–43. DBP is found in human
cerebrospinal fluid32,44.
DBP has three domains, with each serving a specific
function42. Vitamin D vitamers are bound in the first
domain42. Only 1–2% of DBP are bound to vitamin D,
suggesting that DBP function extends beyond its vitamin
D transport properties41,43. The second and third domain
of DBP binds fatty acids42,45, extracellular structural
proteins42,46, and trombospondin47, in the circulation
after cell necrosis and tissue injury. The carboxy-terminal
domain of DBP also contains an O-linked glycosylation
site48,49. Enzymatic cleavage of this side transforms DBP
into a lower molecular weight DBP-L (53.4kD)48. This
DBD-L was characterized as a potent macrophage-
activating factor (termed DBP-MAF)49. The potential
relevance of DBP modifications to MMD pathogenesis is
unknown.
In this pilot study, we tested potential blood-based
markers of inflammation, NFκB activation, and vitamin D
in adolescents with MMD, to better understand their
contribution to MMD in youth4,14,22,50. Using a new
strategy, we identified a candidate biomarker for BD that
changes in response to inflammation, cell death, and
vitamin D status.

dures, and reagent information is provided in Supple-
mentary Materials.
Patients
Plasma samples used in this study were collected from a
subset of participants enrolled in the National Institute of
Mental Health (NIMH) Longitudinal Assessment of
Manic Symptoms (LAMS) study, which examines mood
symptom changes and elevated symptoms of mania
Petrov et al. Translational Psychiatry  (2018) 8:61

 (ESM) biannually in 685 youth aged 6–12 years recruited
at four sites51 The Ohio State University (OSU) Institu-
tional Review Board approved both the LAMS study and
this sub-study. Assent from the youth and informed
consent from the parent were obtained prior to data
collection.
Study design and clinical assessment
Clinical study procedures were conducted in the Child
Mood Lab of Dr. Fristad at the OSU Wexner Medical
Center Harding Hospital. Diagnostic data used in this
study were obtained by post-doctoral or graduate student
trained interviewers who met ongoing standards for inter-
rater reliability. Mood questions from the Kiddie Schedule
for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age
Children-Present and Lifetime Episode (K-SADS-PL-W)
were used to determine MMD. Interviewers were unaware
of vitamin D level results at the time of the interviews.
Participants (n = 36) were grouped into three cate-
gories: Non-mood controls (n = 13), bipolar (BD) (n =
12), and MDD (n = 11). Groups were assigned based on
consensus conference review led by a licensed child/
adolescent psychologist. Body mass index was calculated
using standardized height and weight measures. Blood
was collected by OSU Clinical Research Center nursing
staff.
Concentrations of inflammatory cytokine IL-6, auto-
antibodies to oxLDL, and vitamin D in serum as well as
serum NFκB activity were measured and analyzed in
conjunction with metabolic characteristics (body mass
index (BMI)). All experiments except clinical vitamin D
levels were performed in a ‘‘blind’’ fashion using coded
information from participants.
Vitamin D detection
Vitamin
D
(25-hydroxycalciferol
and
25-hydro-
xyergocalciferol) analysis on serum was performed by
high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled
with mass spectrometry (MS) detection at the Esoterix
Laboratory Services, Inc. (Austin, Texas).
NFκB assay
The cumulative NFκB activation potential of plasma
was measured using NF-κB/green fluorescence protein
biosensor assay as described previously52 and in Supple-
mentary Materials.
Immunoprecipitation and LTQ Orbitrap
Mouse
anti-human
GMFβ
antibody
(Proteintech,
Rosemont, IL, USA) was conjugated on beads (Millipore,
Darmstadt, Germany). Cell lysates were incubated with
anti-GMFβ-conjugated beads according to manufacturers’
protocol. Proteins bound to anti-GMFβ-conjugated beads
were eluted, digested, and identified by capillary-liquid
chromatography-nanospray tandem mass spectrometry
(Capillary-LC/MS/MS) of global protein identification
was performed on a Thermo Fisher LTQ orbitrap mass
spectrometer
equipped
with
a
microspray
source
(Michrom Bioresources Inc, Auburn, CA) operated in
positive ion mode. One-hundred twenty-six proteins were
identified
by
immunoprecipitation
using
anti-GMFβ
antibody that were present at higher levels in serum from
MMD than non-mood control group. We excluded pro-
teins that were not present in plasma in one group of
patients (Ratio 0 or n/a). The size of putative GMFβ-
positive homolog (50 ± 5 kD) was determined using indi-
vidual plasma samples from all patients analyzed by
western blot using the same antibodies. Homology com-
parison was performed for proteins that had a molecular
weight of 50 ± 5 kD. The remaining protein structures
were analyzed for the homology to GMFβ (Accession
number NP_004115.1) using NCBI BLAST program.
DBP accession number used for this program was
AAA61704.1.
A mouse monoclonal antibody raised against amino
acids 175–474 mapping at the C-terminus of DBP of
human origin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-365441) was
conjugated on beads and immunoprecipitation was per-
formed as described above. Samples were pooled from all
investigated participants without mood disorders or with
BD. On beads digestion and capillary-liquid chromato-
graphy-nanospray tandem mass spectrometry is described
in Supplementary Materials.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA)
IL-6
serum
concentrations
were
analyzed
using
Immulite 1000 IL-6 assay (Siemens Healthcare Diag-
nostics, Deerfield, IL) using monoclonal murine anti-IL-6
antibody (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Deerfield, IL,
LK6P).
Human IgG autoantibodies to oxidized low-density
lipoproteins (oxLDL) in serum were measured using an
Anti-Oxidized
LDL
(oLAB)
ELISA
Kit
(Biomedica,
Vienna, Austria).
DBP concentrations in serum were analyzed using
polyclonal antibodies recognizing DBP without bound
actin (Alpco, Salem, NH, USA, 30–2314) and monoclonal
(DVDBP0,Quantikine ELISA, R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
MN, USA) anti-DBP ELISA assays.
Western blot
The plasma from all patients was diluted (1:60) to
achieve the linear range for detection in western blot. The
standard serum was prepared using a pool of equal
volume (5 μL) from all tested plasma samples under
reducing conditions. Serum samples were separated on
10% polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions. Each
western blot included standard plasma as well as plasma
Petrov et al. Translational Psychiatry  (2018) 8:61 
Page 3 of 10
 samples from two non-mood control, two MDD, and two
BD patients. DBP was detected using rabbit monoclonal
anti-DBP antibody (ab8130730 Abcam, Cambridge, MA,
USA) and secondary infrared antibodies (LI-COR Bios-
ciences Lincoln, NE, USA). Membranes were analyzed
using an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System and ImageJ
software. Data were normalized across membranes using
the standard. Standard was prepared using equal aliquots
from each participant from all three groups.
Additional western blots were performed using gradient
polyacrylamide gel (4–20% Mini-PROTEAN #4561096,
BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) using original, deglycosy-
lated/desialylated, plasma samples as well as plasma
samples depleted of albumin and immunoglobulins.
Albumin was removed from randomly selected individual
serum samples using Pierce albumin/IgG removal kit
(89875, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA,)
following the manufacturer’s protocol for human serum
albumin and immunoglobulin removal. One-hundred and
sixty microliters of PBS was added to each sample to
create a final dilution of 1:32. Samples were then analyzed
using western blot or were treated with protein deglyco-
sylation mix II (P6044S, New England Biolabs, Ipswich,
MA, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol for
denaturing reaction conditions. After desialylation and
deglycosylation samples were analyzed by western blot as
described above.
Multiaffinity chromatography
Pooled plasma from participants with and without BD
was purified on HU-6 multiaffinity removal column (4.6 ×
50 mm, P.N 5185–5084, Agilent Technologies) using
manufacturer’s protocol. Fractions were collected and
analyzed using dot blot. DBP was detected using antibody
and procedures described in western blot.
Statistical analysis
Data was shown as mean ± standard deviation (SD).
Two-tailed t-tests, R values, ANOVA one-way analysis
and Tukey’s honest significance test (Tukey HSD) were
used to compare differences between groups (unless
otherwise
stated).
Normality
was
measured
using
Shapiro–Wilk Test. Correlation between normally and
non-normally distributed variables was examined using
Pearson’s test and Spearman Correlation, respectively.
The level of significance was set at p < 0.05.
Results
BMI is described to account for contribution of adipose
tissue to proinflammatory cytokine production53. BMI
was significantly lower in BD participants (Table 1, p <
0.02) compared to the MDD group. BMI in non-mood
controls was not significantly different from other groups.
Similar changes in BMI values have been reported in
other studies among adolescent MMD participants com-
pared to adolescents without mood disorders54,55. As
expected, BMI is positively associated with IL-6 con-
centration in serum from all participants (Table 2, p <
0.02). Also consistent with previous studies56–58, we found
that vitamin D concentrations in serum are inversely
associated with BMI in all participants (Fig. 1, p < 0.006).

 In agreement with known immune functions of vitamin
D56, serum vitamin D concentrations showed inverse
associations when compared to inflammatory cytokine IL-
6 (Table 2, p < 0.04) and autoantibodies to oxLDL, a
marker of oxidative stress (Table 2, p < 0.05). Thus, ado-
lescents with and without MMD show similar associations
between obesity assessed by BMI, inflammation, and
vitamin D status as documented previously in other
populations13,22,53,56,57.
We also examined whether cytokines, vitamin D, and
NFκB are altered in serum isolated from participants with
and without MMD. We found no difference between
serum vitamin D concentrations in participants from non-
mood control, MMD, or BD groups (Table 1). Levels of
IL-6 and autoantibodies to oxidized LDL were variable
within groups and were not statistically different between
participants (Table 1). Similarly, NFκB activation in
reporter cells stimulated by serum from patients with and
without MMD was not different among groups (Table 1).
Thus, none of the major inflammatory factors or vitamin
D had the power to detect differences in small groups of
adolescent participants with and without MMD.
We also hypothesized that MMD pathogenesis may
depend on specific inflammatory factor(s) that share
properties and structural homology with inflammatory
cytokines in the brain. GMFβ is an established neuro-
trophic and inflammatory factor implicated in activation
of glia and development of the nervous system, angio-
genesis, and immune function59,60. Using anti-GMFβ
antibodies and the bait strategy61,62, we investigated
whether serum from participants with and without MMD
contains different amount of GMFβ or its protein
homolog. We performed immunoprecipitation using anti-
GMFβ antibodies in pooled serum from patients with and
without MMD. The sequence of bound proteins to GMFβ
was identified by mass spectrometry (Supplementary
Table 1). Individual sample analysis by western blot
showed that the weight of homologous protein was
approximately 50 kD in plasma of participants with and
without
MMD.
Next,
we
compared
for
structural
homology of proteins to GMFβ. The low molecular
weight vitamin D-binding protein (DBP-L, 53KD) showed
37% shared homology with GMFβ. DBP-L was present at
eightfold higher levels in serum of participants with MMD
compared to those without mood disorder. The structural
proteins vitronectin, clusterin, and tubulins were also
~50 kD proteins homologous to GMFβ and present at
higher levels in participants with MMD compared to the
control group. However, in this paper we investigated
DBP, given its roles in protection of nervous tissue by
removing structural proteins from circulation, delivery of
vitamin D, and regulation of inflammation42.
Given the qualitative nature of immunoprecipitation/
sequencing, we validated and quantified the levels of DBP
in serum of participants with and without MMD using
western blot, mono- and polyclonal ELISA. Western blot
revealed heterogenous bands (53–56 kD) including DBP-
H and DBP-L, respectively in non-mood controls, MDD,
and BD (Fig. 2a). The comparison of total DBP levels in
serum measured by western blot showed a moderate
increase in total DBP (121%) in MDD vs. non-mood
controls (Fig. 2b, p = 0.13, n.s.). In the serum of BD par-
ticipants total DBP (137%) levels were significantly
increased compared to those in non-mood control group
(Fig. 2b, p < 0.02). The immunoprecipitation using anti-
DBP antibodies revealed a similar (156%) increase in DBP
serum pooled from all participants with BD compared to
those without this disease (Supplementary Table 2).
The removal of albumin augmented the differences
between DBP in plasma from participants with and
without BD (Fig. 2c). However, this procedure impedes
quantitative analysis because a substantial portion of DBP
is eluted with albumin (Supplementary Fig. 1) due to the
structural homology of these proteins42. To examine if
DBP heterogeneity is a result of its modification, we
performed enzymatic delycosylation and desialylation of
plasma from randomly selected participants with and
without BD plasma. Gradient gel electrophoresis sepa-
rated DBP in plasma as a single band (Supplementary Fig.
2A). However, the treatment with deglycosylation and
desialylation enzymes produced multiple modified DBP
forms in plasma from both patients with and without BD
(Supplementary Fig. 2B). Thus, in this pilot study, elevated
total DBP levels comprising of all modifications were
associated with BD.
The heterogeneity of DBP modifications has profound
impact on the outcome of DBP quantification using dif-
ferent methods. DBP measured by western blot was not
associated with DBP measured by either monoclonal or
polyclonal ELISA, suggesting that ELISA antibodies do
not recognize all DBP modifications (Table 3, Supple-
mentary Fig. 3A, B). DBP measured by monoclonal ELISA
Fig. 1 Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels are inversely correlated
with BMI in combined groups. Inverse linear correlation between
vitamin D concentrations in plasma and BMI measured in combined
groups of patients with and without MMD. Pearson correlation
Petrov et al. Translational Psychiatry  (2018) 8:61 
Page 5 of 10
 also showed no correlation with vitamin D concentration
in serum in non-mood control (Fig. 3a). However, in
MDD participants, but not in BD participants DBP levels
recognized by polyclonal ELISA were inversely associated
with vitamin D levels (Fig. 3b, p < 0.013 vs. Fig. 3c).
Indirectly, this opposite trend suggests a change in DBP
structure responsible for vitamin D transport in the MDD
group compared to non-mood participants. It is expected,
because DBP binds various ligands, including structural
proteins, complement factors, vitamin D vitamers, and
lipids42. DBP measured by western blot shows no
significant associations with vitamin D levels in plasma
(Fig. 3d–f) in agreement with evidence of vitamin D
transport by approximately 2% of total DBP42. Thus,
compared to western blot, ELISA appears to recognize
only specific fractions of DBP that were not different
among participants with and without MMD (Supple-
mentary Figure 3C, D)
Discussion
The major finding in our study is the identification of
increased levels of DBP in participants with BD compared
to non-mood controls. The increased levels of DBP in the
circulation of adolescents with BD could be interpreted in
two ways: DBP plays a role in the pathogenesis of BD in
adolescents or DBP is a factor associated with this
disorder.
Vitamin D has been recognized in playing an important
role in reducing inflammation through immunomodula-
tory properties56. However, only 2% of DBP functions in
the capacity of a vitamin D transporter42. Moreover,
vitamin D–DBP complex has a restricted passage through
the blood–brain barrier63. Another, non-vitamin D carrier
role for DBP is the binding of alternative cargo ligands in
response to cellular damage and subsequent activation of
inflammation43. Cellular and neurocellular damage leads
to release of actin43, and possibly other structural pro-
teins64. Binding of actin to GMFβ65 in the brain and to
DBP in the cerebrospinal fluid and circulation prevents
actin polymerization, aggregation, and activation of the
coagulation cascade. In multiple sclerosis, DBP con-
centrations in the cerebrospinal fluid serve as a biomarker
for this disease32,66. Recent investigations demonstrate
that defects in actin polymerization may also be an
underlying
course
of
BD
pathology67,68,
whereas

Representative western blot image shows total DBP in plasma from
randomly selected participants without MMD (non-mood control),
with MDD, and with BD. High and low molecular weight portions of
heterogenous DBP are indicated by arrows (DBP-H and DBP-L,

polyacrylamide gel. b Total DBP levels were quantified based on
western blot analysis in serum obtained from participants in control,
MMD, and BD groups. Each blot contained control, BD, MDD, and
standard. Standard comprised of equal aliquots from plasma of all
participants. DBP was quantified based on the density of bands and
normalized across membranes using standard (arbitrary density of the
standard was set as 100% in each blot). Lines represent the values
obtained from individual patients after normalization by standard. Red
lines show the mean value in each group. Group comparison was
measured using ANOVA one-way analysis. c Four randomly selected
plasma samples from patients with and without BD were purified
from albumin and analyzed using western blot before and after
albumin purification

 mutations in β-tubulin underlie axonal damage69. More-
over, stabilization of the cytoskeleton is a major basis for
lithium, valproate, and paliperidone therapies67,68. Addi-
tionally, transcriptome analysis of post-mortem brain
tissues from participants with and without schizophrenia
or BD also highlights the cytoskeleton as a central
deranged pathway in these disorders70. In our immuno-
precipitation experiments, we found 35-fold increased

 levels of actin and other structural proteins such as
tubulins, actin, actinin, or multimerin in serum from
participants with BD vs. non-mood controls. However, it
remains to be investigated whether DBP binds these
structural proteins, or whether structural proteins were
recognized by anti-DBP antibody nonspecifically in serum
from participants with BD compared to non-mood con-
trols (Supplemental Tables 1 and 2). These structural
proteins required testing as candidate markers for BD in
addition to DBP. In previous studies, DBP levels appear to
indicate an early pathological manifestation of diseases
linked to the cytoskeleton damage as a biomarker32,66. BD
is results in derangements of the cytoskeletons67,68 and
elevated concentrations of DBP in BD may indicate these
detrimental changes.
DBP is also closely related to inflammatory processes,
which were thoroughly investigated for their role in BD
and MDD in the context of major inflammatory markers
such as IL-6, MCP1, and TNFα9,12,14,21. In our study, IL-6,
showed no significant changes among the different
groups. Elevated IL-6 levels in circulation accompanies
many proinflammatory conditions including obesity71.
We found a significant correlation between plasma levels
of IL-6 and BMI across all studied groups. These results
suggest that obesity and probably other unaccounted
inflammatory processes in these study participants con-
tributed to chronic inflammation more than those acti-
vated by neurocellular damage.
DBP has a principally different mode of inflammatory
action responding to early changes in damaged cellular
membranes32 or to extracellular actin72. DBP binds lyso-
phosphotidylcholine (Lyso-Pc) with a high affinity73,74.
Lyso-Pc is a lipid mediator of acute and chronic inflam-
mation in peripheral organs and nervous system in
response to oxidative damage, inflammation, extracellular
actin or changes in the intracellular actin network72,75.
Binding of lyso-PC in the presence of T and B cells acti-
vates cleavage of DBP to DBP-L74, which can then activate
macrophages in various diseases (DBP-MAF reviewed in
ref. 42). In our study, we found significantly elevated DBP
levels in participants with BD compared to non-mood
controls, using western blot recognizing multiple forms of
DBP. In contrast, ELISA using polyclonal anti-DBP anti-
bodies, appear to recognize only DBP forms associated
with decreased vitamin D transport in MDD participants.
Similar prognostic changes were reported in patients with
multiple sclerosis66. Classic conditions associated with
inflammation including IL-6 levels in plasma, NFκB
activation, or obesity were similar in participants with and
without MMD in our study. These findings suggest DBP
as a more suitable marker of BD pathology than inflam-
matory cytokines. More studies also need to investigate
binding partners of DBP, especially lipid mediators,
leading to its cleavage in BD. It additionally remains
unclear whether the DBP-L molecule is a macrophage-
activating factor augmenting inflammation and patho-
genesis of BD. Other proteins immunoprecipitated with
anti-GMFβ or anti-DBP should also be studied as
potential
biomarkers
of
MDD.
Despite
of
these
unknowns, in this pilot investigation, DBP appears to
significantly change in response to BD pathogenesis and
needs to be tested as a candidate marker for BD in a large
cohort of adolescents and adults in the future.
The important methodological outcome of our study is
the direct comparison of different tools for DBP mea-
surement, including monoclonal and polyclonal anti-DBP
based ELISA, proteomic and western blot analysis. We
found that total DBP comprising of DBP-H and DBP-L
forms can only be detected with western blot and pro-
teomics. The binding of different cargo molecules to
DBP42,43 in participants with and without MDD changes
the affinity to antibodies in ELISA that obscure mea-
surements. Reducing conditions in western blot lead to
dissociation of cargo molecules from DBP and allow
detection of heterogenous DBP-L and DBP-H modifica-
tions. Similar ELISA paradoxes have been reported in
other studies76. DBP was significantly lower in African
Americans
vs.
Caucasians
when
measured
using
a
monoclonal antibody-based ELISA, but higher with a
polyclonal anti-DBP ELISA76. In contrast, groups applying
proteomic analysis to study cerebrospinal fluid from
patients with multiple sclerosis found two modifications
of DBP66 that were changed in opposite direction in
multiple sclerosis patient with a different clinical course,
suggesting them as new candidate prognostic biomarkers
of disease aggressiveness. Our study, suggests that con-
clusive data on DBP function can be obtained only using
proteomics and/or western blot methods.
Distinguishing BD from unipolar MDD early in the
onset of illness can lead to more appropriately specific
intervention, which has the potential to improve quality of
life, reduce psychosocial morbidities, and recurrent mood
episodes. The latter convey increased risk for suicide and
for
physical
comorbidities,
especially
in
adolescent
patients4,50. Genetic, dietary, and inflammatory factors
influence the pathogenesis of BD and development of the
CNS77. DBP integrates responses to neuronal cell death,
activation of inflammatory cascade, and vitamin D and
lipid status40–43,49,66,74,78,79. Thus, DBP holds promise as a
diagnostic biomarker changing in response to all major
factors contributing to pathogenesis of BD, and may shed
light on BD pathophysiologic mechanisms.
