Abstract
Human skeletal muscle fibers exist across a continuum of slow ! fast-twitch. The amount
of each fiber type (FT) influences muscle performance but remains largely unexplored in
elite athletes, particularly from strength/power sports. To address this nescience, vastus
lateralis (VL) biopsies were performed on World/Olympic (female, n = 6, “WCF”) and
National-caliber (female, n = 9, “NCF”; and male, n = 6, “NCM”) American weightlifters. Par-
ticipant accolades included 3 Olympic Games, 19 World Championships, 25 National rec-
ords, and >170 National/International medals. Samples were analyzed for myosin heavy
chain (MHC) content via SDS-PAGE using two distinct techniques: single fiber (SF) distribu-
tion (%) and homogenate (HG) composition. The main finding was that these athletes dis-
played the highest pure MHC IIa concentrations ever reported in healthy VL (23±9% I, 5±3%
I/IIa, 67±13% IIa, and 6±10% IIa/IIx), with WCF expressing a notable 71±17% (NCF = 67
±8%, NCM = 63±16%). No pure MHC IIx were found with SF. Secondary analysis revealed
the heavyweights accounted for 91% of the MHC IIa/IIx fibers, which caused a correlation
between this FT and body mass. Additionally, when compared to SF, HG overestimated
MHC I (23±9 vs. 31±9%) and IIx (0±0 vs. 3±6%) by misclassifying I/IIa fibers as I and IIa/IIx
fibers as IIx, highlighting the limitation of HG as a measure of isoform distribution. These
results collectively suggest that athlete caliber (World vs. National) and/or years competing
in the sport determine FT% more than sex, particularly for MHC IIa. The extreme fast-twitch
myofiber abundance likely explains how elite weightlifters generate high forces in rapid time-
frames.
Introduction
Italian physician Stefano Lorenzini made the first distinction of “red” and “white” muscle
fibers (myofibers) in 1678, and almost 200 years later (1873) French histologist Louis-Antoine
Ranvier confirmed the existence of two distinct myofiber types in vertebrate skeletal muscle.
Reintroduction of the skeletal muscle biopsy procedure in 1962 [1] allowed scientists to begin
exploring the topic in athletes and resulted in the discovery that each FT is comprised of a

 unique MHC isoform signature. Human skeletal muscle therefore contains three pure (MHC
I, IIa, and IIx) and several hybrid (single myofibers that co-expresses multiple MHC isoforms)
FTs [2]. The pure and hybrid FTs combine to form a robust slow ! fast continuum (MHC I
! I/IIa ! IIa ! IIa/IIx ! IIx) with each displaying specific morphological, metabolic, and
contractile properties [3–6]. FT% (the relative quantity of each FT in a given muscle) influ-
ences whole muscle function [7] and is often highly correlated with athletic performance [3, 7–
13].
Extensive evidence indicates endurance athletes possess a slow-twitch myofiber majority [9,
10, 12, 14, 15], yet comparatively, far few investigations have explored FT in speed, power, or
strength athletes. Initial research in the 1970–80’s found that resistance-trained men expressed
high quantities (~60–65%) of fast-twitch fibers [11, 12, 15, 16], which was substantiated by
later studies on elite powerlifters [17] and national-caliber (‘Olympic’) weightlifters [8]. This
work provided an important foundation, but used sub-elite participants [18] and/or laboratory
methods that failed to accurately resolve the highly prevalent hybrids [19–21]—which compro-
mises measurement fidelity and produces erroneous FT% conclusions [19, 22–25]. More pre-
cise techniques were developed in the early 1990’s that allowed proper quantification of FT%
by analyzing each SF.
Since this time only 13 studies (Table 1) implemented SF in young speed, power, or
strength-trained individuals [5, 13, 19, 20, 22, 23, 25–30], and only 3 included females (n = 13,
total). Only 5/13 included athletes: unknown-caliber male sprinters (n = 6) [25], male soccer
players (n = 8) [24], elite female track and field athletes from a combination of pole vault, hep-
tathlon, 100 and 400 m hurdles, and long jump events (n = 6) [20], National-caliber male
bodybuilders (n = 8) [19], and a former World-champion male sprinter (n = 1) [13]. Accu-
rately accounting for the full FT spectrum resulted in all five studies finding far lower MHC IIa
concentrations than expected (52%, 30%, 16%, 39%, and 34%, respectively). The extremely low
16% found by Parcell et al. (2003) [20] is possibly explained by sex as females are often pur-
ported to possess more slow-twitch fibers than men [31, 32]. Such sex-specific phenotypes are
often the case in murine models [31], but the topic remains unexplored in athletes. Moreover,

 these data are difficult to interpret as the athletes sampled were from a combination of several
dissimilar events.
Numerous other knowledge gaps persist because in over 50 years of human muscle FT
research only two studies have utilized SF with elite (i.e., world or international) athletes (one
male sprinter and six female track and field) and no research has done so with any strength or
power athletes. Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the FT% of elite weightlifters to
provide novel insight into the phenotype of competitive female and male strength and power
athletes.
Methods
Experimental approach to the problem
Twenty-one elite (‘Olympic’) Weightlifters (15 female, 6 male) underwent resting VL biopsies
between 2–96 hours after competing in either the International Weightlifting Federation
World Championships or the USA Weightlifting American Open Finals (2017). All proce-
dures and risks were explained to the athletes prior to obtaining written consent and complet-
ing medical and exercise history questionnaires. Performance records (taken from this event)
in the snatch and clean and jerk (1RM), competition medals, and other accolades were gath-
ered from personal interviews and publically available records from these or other sanctioned
meets. Each muscle sample was analyzed for MHC content using two distinct FT techniques:
SF and HG. The California State University, Fullerton Institutional Review Board approved all
experimental procedures prior to any testing and consent was received in oral and written
format.
Participants
Participants were subdivided into three categories; WCF (n = 6 female), NCF (n = 9), and
NCM (n = 6). Athletes were considered “World-caliber” if they were on the most recent Olym-
pic or World team and competed at the most recent national event. Athletes were considered
“National-caliber” if they were top 5 placers at the 2017 American Open Finals meet but had
never been on a World or Olympic team. Athletes spanned multiple weight categories, had a
minimum of two years of national competition experience, had competed exclusively for the
United States of America, and were otherwise eligible for all American national meets
(Table 2). Athlete accolades at the time of data collection included participation in 3 Olympic
Games, 19 World Championships, 11 Pan American Championships, 49 National Champion-
ships, 32 American Opens, 8 University National Championships, and 25 Junior World/Pan
American/National Championships. Participants also held 25 national records and >170

 national/international medals either at the time of the study or in the past. One athlete had
tested positive for substances prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency and was sus-
pended from the sport for two years prior to participating in the study.
Procedures
Muscle biopsies.
Following 30 minutes of supine rest, athletes underwent a mid-muscle
belly (approximately halfway between the greater trochanter and patella) biopsy of the VL. A
detailed description of the biopsy procedure has been previously described by our lab [9, 22,
23, 33]. Briefly, a small area of the thigh was numbed by injection of a local anesthetic (Xylo-
caine/Lidocaine without epinephrine). An approximately ¼ inch incision was made in the
superficial cutaneous tissues. Muscle samples were obtained using the Bergstro
¨m technique
with suction [1], immediately cleansed of excess blood and connective tissue, divided into
approximately 10–15 mg strips, placed into cold skinning solution (125 mM K propionate, 2.0
mM EGTA, 4.0 mM ATP, 1.0 mM MgCl2, 20.0 mM imidazole [pH 7.0], and 50% [vol ml/vol
ml] glycerol), and stored at -20˚ C for at least one week. Each sample was split such that a por-
tion (~5 mg) could be used for SF or HG. The incision site was cleaned, pulled closed with a
sterile Band-Aid, and covered with sterile gauze and cohesive bandage tape.
MHC FT identification.
All biopsy samples were analyzed for MHC via SDS-PAGE using
two distinct techniques: SF and HG. For SF, individual fibers (N = 2,147; 102 ± 3 fibers per ath-
lete) were mechanically isolated with fine tweezers under a light microscope and placed in
80 μl of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) buffer (1% SDS, 23 mM EDTA, 0.008% bromophenol
blue, 15% glycerol, and 715 mM b-mercaptoethanol [pH 6.8]). HG samples (~5 mg) were
hand homogenized and then diluted between 1:10 to 1:50 based on sample amount and pro-
tein quantity. As described in detail elsewhere [5, 9, 22, 23, 27], 1–2 μl aliquots of both SF or
HG (run separately) were then loaded into individual wells in a 3.5% loading and 5% separat-
ing gel (SDS-PAGE), run at 5˚C for 15.5 hours (SE 600 Series; Hoefer, San Francisco, CA,
USA), and silver stained for MHC identification. The SF approach used known molecular
weights and standards to identify the MHC isoform (MHC I, I/IIa, IIa, IIa/IIx, and IIx) of each
individual myofiber. This enabled the most accurate calculation of the FT% within the muscle
sample [21]. HG utilized densitometry (ImageJ, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD)
to quantify the relative MHC protein composition (i.e., percent area occupied by each pure
isoform; MHC I, IIa, and IIx) of each sample, which is highly correlated with FT area [34].
Thus, SF indicates how frequently each isoform exists but cannot address how much area each
FT occupies within the muscle. HG addresses the latter, but cannot delineate hybrids, therefore
inaccurately quantifying FT% [9, 21–25, 27].
Statistical analysis
Potential differences between groups in descriptive information were examined via ANOVA.
For SF, potential differences in FT% between groups were assessed via a 3 (group: WCF, NCF,
NCM) x 4 (fiber type: MHC I, I/IIa, IIa, IIa/IIx) ANOVA. For HG, potential differences in FT
composition between groups were examined via a 3 (group: WCF, NCF, NCM) x 3 (fiber type:
MHC I, IIa, IIx) ANOVA. Comparison of SF vs. HG was accomplished by a 2 (group: SF, HG)
x 3 (fiber type: MHC I, IIa, IIx) ANOVA. Effect size was calculated with Cohen’s D
(0.2 = small difference, 0.5 = medium difference, and 0.8 = large difference) to identify the
magnitude of difference between two groups. Pearson Product Moment Correlations (r) were
assessed for WCF, NCF, and NCM between 1RM, body mass, and SF FT%. All individual FT
data are reported in Table 3. Data are reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD), unless

 otherwise noted. Significance was established a priori at an alpha level of p < 0.05. All analyses
were performed with SPSS (SPSS Statistics Version 24, IBM).
Results
Descriptive
WCF were significantly older than NCF, but not NCM (Table 2). WCF also had significantly
more years of sport competition experience than NCF and NCM. NCM exceeded both WCF
and NCF in relative strength in both the snatch 1RM and clean and jerk 1RM.
SF distribution
FT% for all lifters combined was 23 ± 9% I, 5 ± 3% I/IIa, 67 ± 13% IIa, and 6 ± 10% IIa/IIx. No
MHC IIx or I/IIa/IIx fibers were identified. No significant differences existed between groups,
despite WCF possessing 8% (absolute, not percent difference) less MHC I than NCF (d = 0.88)
and NCM (d = 0.78) (Fig 1). The difference in MHC IIa between WCF and NCM (also 8%)
was also not statistically significant, but had a moderate effect size (d = 0.50). The vast majority
of the MHC IIa/IIx fibers (91%) belonged to just five lifters, all of whom competed in the
heavyweight or super heavyweight categories (� 90 kg for women and �105 kg for men). This
produced significant correlations between body mass and MHC IIa/IIx frequency for WCF

p = 0.080).
HG composition
FT composition for all lifters combined was 31 ± 9% I, 67 ± 9% IIa, and 3 ± 6% IIx. MHC I
tended (p = 0.08) to be lower in WCF (24 ± 7%) than NCF (33 ± 9%, p = 0.125, d = 1.14) and
NCM (35 ± 9%, p = 0.106, d = 1.33), yet MHC IIa was significantly higher (p = 0.046) in WCF
(74 ± 6%) than NCM (61 ± 11%, p = 0.043, d = 1.39), but not NCF (65 ± 7%, p = 0.145,
d = 1.28) and. FT was significantly different (p < 0.001) between SF and HG for MHC I
(p = 0.005) and MHC IIx (p = 0.046), but not MHC IIa. SF MHC IIa/IIx and HG MHC IIx
were highly correlated (r = 0.96, p < 0. 001). No correlations existed for SF or HG between FT
% and snatch or clean and jerk relative 1RM when analyzed as subgroups or when combined
together.
Discussion
The current study resulted in the most detailed investigation of muscle phenotype in Olympic
and World-caliber anaerobic athletes published to date. These data are the first comparison of
World vs. National-caliber athletes at the SF level. Additionally, they enabled the most precise
description of FT% in strength or power sport competitors, and the first ever in females. The

 primary finding was that the pure MHC IIa abundance was the highest in healthy muscle (VL)
ever reported, especially for females. This finding suggests athlete caliber and/or years compet-
ing in the sport influence FT% more than sex per se and also questions the pronouncement
that male athletes possess more fast-twitch myofibers than females. Secondary findings
revealed that our utilization of two different typing methods confirmed the limitations of HG
for FT% (inappropriately categorizes MHC I/IIa as MHC I and MHC IIa/IIx as MHC IIx) and
also allowed identification of a previously undocumented relationship between body mass and
MHC IIa/IIx concentrations. The unique morphology and phenotypes in our participants
highlight the need to further study elite anaerobic athletes, particularly females.
WCF contained the highest concentration of MHC IIa (71%) reported in the literature to
our knowledge. NCF (67%) and NCM (63%) also possessed more MHC IIa than previous
research in competitive male bodybuilders (40%) [16, 19] as well as male power/weightlifters
[8, 11, 12, 15, 16, 18], elite female pole vaulters, heptathletes, 100 and 400 m hurdlers, and long
jumpers (20), elite male hammer throwers [35], and resistance-trained men [18, 19, 22, 23, 27,
29, 36], which all ranged from 50–60%. Only six previous studies using SF have found pure
MHC IIa concentrations of >50%, with just two reporting 60% (Table 1). The resulting mini-
mal MHC I (~17–25%) in our athletes was strikingly lower than the previously described track
and field athletes (57%) [20] and National-caliber bodybuilders (35%) [19]. These pronounced
differences are likely explained by the substantial dissimilarities in training styles (e.g., external
loading strategies, contraction type and velocity, training frequency, etc.) between the various
sports. More research is therefore needed to continue delineating the subtle but significant dif-
ferences in FT% between athletes from a range of anaerobic sports and the specific role each
training approach might play in altering MHC I and IIa distribution.
Although the differences in FT% between our three groups did not reach statistical signifi-
cance, large effect sizes were evident and MHC IIa frequencies of 74%-89% occurred in 66% of
WCF but only in 44% and 33% of NCF and NCM, respectively. Thus, scientists should further
examine how FT% may separate World from National-level athletes as it would enhance our
understanding of the physiological factors determining maximal human performance. For
example, the only published report on a world-record holding anaerobic athlete found a FT
profile remarkably different from our study or any other previous research in elite sprinters
[13]. The minimal exploration in this area makes it difficult to determine if such a separation
in FT profile between elite subgroups is a true and consistent phenomenon or merely an arti-
fact of too little research.
Our groups differed in two other important characteristics; sex and years competing in the
sport. Sex comparisons between athletes remain tenuous [31, 37] because nearly all investiga-
tions utilize non-gold standard FT% methods [21] and sedentary [38, 39] or “recreationally
active” individuals [32]. Not only do our findings contradict the claim that women possess
more slow-twitch myofibers than men [40], they illustrate the opposite when accounting for
talent level (WCF < NCF = NCM). WCF had also been competing in the sport for ~5 years
longer than both NCF and NCM. The current cross-sectional study-design precludes direct
analysis, but extensive research affords strong support for exercise history as a critical determi-
nate of FT% [2, 9, 26, 28, 30, 41–44]. Chronic exercise generally decreases hybrids [30, 42] and
induces style-specific shifts in FT% such as increases in MHC I with endurance [9, 43, 45] or
MHC IIa with sprint [28], plyometric [26], or strength training [36, 43, 44, 46]. For example,
one study reported an increase in MHC IIa from 46% to 60% following 19 weeks of resistance
training [36]. MHC IIa/IIx fibers appear particularly responsible for exercise-induced
increases in MHC IIa and are thus uncommon in exercise-trained individuals [9, 20, 22–25,
29, 43]. A reduction of MHC IIx in favor of IIa following chronic resistance exercise is also
purported extensively in the literature [28, 34], yet the overwhelming majority of this evidence

 comes from experiments with methodologies (e.g. HG) directly shown here and elsewhere [9,
24, 25, 47] to produce erroneous FT% conclusions.
Most research from the 1970’s– 2000’s utilized either ATPase histochemistry or HG
SDS-PAGE to determine FT% [8, 14–17, 24, 25, 34, 36]. Similar to SF, histochemistry allows
assessment of individual fibers for calculation of percent distribution, yet it does not enable
simultaneous delineate of hybrids [36]. HG suffers the same drawback and actually indicates
FT area/composition [34] more so than distribution making it greatly influenced by the size of
each fiber; which is not uniform across all FTs (particularly in resistance trained individuals)
[48]. All three approaches hold strong merit and are often correlated to each other [34, 49] and
performance [8], but are clearly not interchangeable for maximally precise FT% assessment. In
the current study, HG accurately quantified MHC IIa (within 0–4%), but not I or IIx. MHC I
was overestimated by 8% percent (23 vs. 31%), which is largely explained by the non-differen-
tiated MHC I/IIa fibers (5%). HG also greatly exaggerated MHC IIx, particularly in individuals
with >4% MHC IIa/IIx. The inability of HG to account for MHC IIa/IIx explains why MHC
IIx appear common in some studies [50] even though the actual abundance of pure MHC IIx
fibers in healthy human skeletal muscle is extraordinarily rare; typically <0.1% [9, 22–25, 27]
and 0 of the >2,100 isolated fibers from the current sample. Thus, the seeming conversion of
MHC IIx to IIa with exercise is more precisely IIa/IIx changing to IIa.
MHC IIa/IIx hybrids are typically inversely associated with muscle health and physical
activity [2, 9, 30, 43, 47, 51–54]. Yet, the heavyweights (male and female) expressed irregularly
high concentrations (24%) and accounted for 91% of all MHC IIa/IIx myofibers, explaining
the correlations between body mass and MHC IIa/IIx quantities. Terzis and colleagues (2010)
noted a similar abnormal abundance of MHC IIx (typed via HG, so likely IIa/IIx) in six large
(116 kg, body fat composition >22%), but presumably highly strength-trained throwers [35].
Body composition was not assessed in the current study and little research exists on well-
trained, but high body mass individuals. Not knowing the amount of muscle vs. fat on these
larger participants limits the ability to speculate on potential mechanisms. Thus, additional
studies with a larger sample size across a broader spectrum of physical size are required to
truly interpret the correlations between body mass and MHC IIa/IIx prevalence and to explore
possible mechanisms.
Another juxtaposition was that of FT% and performance. Previous work in 94 kg male
competitive weightlifters found strong correlations between FT composition (via HG) and the
percentage of total area in a muscle that each FT occupies to both snatch 1RM and vertical
jump height [8], but not clean and jerk 1RM. We failed to identify any such correlations (when
all subjects were combined or sub-grouped), but also utilized multiple sexes and weight classes.
Thus, while FT% differed between our groups, that factor alone did not predict performance
among our lifters. Several possible explanations exist for this discrepancy. First, FT area may
determine whole muscle strength more than FT%. Second, neither studies found correlations
to the clean and jerk, which is heavier and slower than the snatch or vertical jump. This com-
pliments previous isokinetic research [23] and indicates FT% does not predict performance on
strength tasks among strength-trained individuals. FT% probably determines movement
speed more than force production [7]. Further speculation on this point is unwarranted as lim-
itations prohibited the ability to assess FT-specific size or contractile properties, which likely
differed significantly across our groups [55] and are known to changes with training [3, 48].
Conclusion
This study provides novel insight into the muscle phenotype of elite competitive strength and
power athletes and highlights the need for more research in this area. The extreme fast-twitch

 abundance partially explains how elite weightlifters are able to generate high forces in short
time-frames. Our data also indicate that athlete caliber and years competing in the sport dic-
tate FT% more than sex per se, but more work is needed to draw firm conclusions as a single
biopsy may not perfectly represent the entire muscle [56]. Most athletes contained few hybrids
and no MHC IIx or I/IIa/IIx, except the heavyweights who possessed atypically high quantities
of IIa/IIx. Future research should use high fidelity techniques to explore FT-specific distribu-
tion, size, and contractile properties in female and male athletes of various caliber, sports, and
body size; ideally across several years of competition. The resulting data could have practical
significance if it enabled experimentation of differing training volumes or recovery protocols
based on athlete-specific FT properties [57]. Scientifically, our findings importantly contribute
to the knowledge-base of fiber type-specific physiology.
