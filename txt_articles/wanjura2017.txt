Background: There is a strong association between obesity and gallstones. However, there is no clear
evidence regarding the optimal order of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and cholecystectomy when
both procedures are clinically indicated.
Methods: Based on cross-matched data from the Swedish Register for Cholecystectomy and Endoscopic
Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (GallRiks; 79 386 patients) and the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery
Registry (SOReg; 36 098 patients) from 2007 to 2013, complication rates, reoperation rates and operation
times related to the timing of RYGB and cholecystectomy were explored.
Results: There was a higher aggregate complication risk when cholecystectomy was performed after
RYGB rather than before (odds ratio (OR) 1⋅35, 95 per cent c.i. 1⋅09 to 1⋅68; P = 0⋅006). A complica-
tion after the first procedure independently increased the complication risk of the following procedure
(OR 2⋅02, 1⋅44 to 2⋅85; P < 0⋅001). Furthermore, there was an increased complication risk when chole-
cystectomy was performed at the same time as RYGB (OR 1⋅72, 1⋅14 to 2⋅60; P = 0⋅010). Simultaneous
cholecystectomy added 61⋅7 (95 per cent c.i. 56⋅1 to 67⋅4) min (P < 0⋅001) to the duration of surgery.
Conclusion: Cholecystectomy should be performed before, not during or after, RYGB.

Introduction
There is a strong association between obesity, gallstone
formation1–5 and cholecystectomy5,
6. With the worldwide
increase in obesity7, obese individuals with symptomatic
gallstone disease constitute an increasingly large group
of patients likely to undergo both cholecystectomy and
bariatric surgery during their lifetime. When both chole-
cystectomy and bariatric surgery are clinically indicated,
such as for an obese patient with symptomatic gallstone
disease, there is still no clear evidence as to the optimal
sequence of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYBG) and chole-
cystectomy.
There is an increased risk of postoperative complications,
including reoperation, when cholecystectomy is performed
on patients who have previously undergone RYGB8. That
study was based on cross-matched nationwide register
data from the Swedish Register for Cholecystectomy
and Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography
(GallRiks)9–11 and the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery
Registry (SOReg), 2007–201312–14. It is not known,
however, whether the order in which cholecystectomy
and RYGB are performed has an impact on the aggregate
complication rate of the two procedures.
Before the introduction of laparoscopic bariatric surgery,
simultaneous prophylactic cholecystectomy was often
routine practice during a bariatric procedure15. However,
laparoscopic RYGB with simultaneous cholecystectomy
appears to be associated with higher complication and
reintervention rates than laparoscopic RYGB alone16,
17.
The overall cost-effectiveness is highly dependent upon
the predicted incidence of gallbladder-related symptoms
after RYGB18. A meta-analysis from 201319 concluded
that RYGB with prophylactic cholecystectomy should be
avoided unless the patient has known symptomatic biliary

disease. However, the 13 studies selected, covering a total
of 6048 RYGB procedures, reported only 398 subsequent
cholecystectomies with a surprisingly low complication
rate (1⋅8 per cent). Although definition of a complication
varies in the literature, this rate is much lower than the 6⋅1
per cent for elective and 11⋅2 per cent for urgent chole-
cystectomy reported in the 30-day postoperative follow-up
in GallRiks9.
Some advocate routine prophylactic cholecystectomy
at the time of bariatric surgery even in the absence of
gallstones20–22, whereas others favour a far more restric-
tive policy23. This study examined the effect of the order
of cholecystectomy and RYGB (when performed on
different occasions) on aggregate complication rates,
reoperation rates and operation times. The secondary aim
of this study was to compare RYGB with simultaneous
cholecystectomy and RYGB without with respect to the
same outcome measures.
Methods
This study was based on a previously described Swedish
database from 2007 to 20138, comprising all cholecystec-
tomy events in the GallRiks register9–11 and all primary
RYGB events in the SOReg register12–14, cross-matched

number24. RYGB revision surgery was not included in the
database. Both registers provided data registered in the
perioperative period as well as 30-day complication data.
Patients on whom any other surgical intervention was
performed at the time of either RYGB or cholecystectomy
were excluded (for example those undergoing cholecys-
tectomy with closure of mesenteric defects after RYGB or
cholecystectomy as part of liver or pancreas surgery).
Outcome variables in the multivariable analyses were:
peroperative complication rate; 30-day postoperative com-
plication rate; combined peroperative and 30-day post-
operative complication rate; 30-day reoperation rate (open
or laparoscopic, not endoscopic); and duration of surgery.
Explanatory (predictor) variables in the multivariable anal-
yses were: subgroup based on order of the procedures; sex;
mean of age at cholecystectomy and RYGB; and BMI at the
time of RYGB. When comparing RYGB with, and with-
out simultaneous cholecystectomy, the primary surgical
approach (open or laparoscopic) was included as an addi-
tional explanatory variable. When comparing cholecystec-
tomy after RYGB with cholecystectomy before RYGB, the
analyses were also stratified for cholecystectomy-related
factors (intraoperative cholangiography outcome, chole-
cystectomy urgency and cholecystectomy indication) to
assess possible explanations for the differences observed.
Complication and reoperation data and operation times
were obtained from SOReg as well as GallRiks when-
ever available. For RYGB with simultaneous cholecys-
tectomy, only the SOReg operation times were included
in the analyses in order to avoid cases where the same
combined operation time for cholecystectomy and RYGB
had been registered incorrectly in both GallRiks and
SOReg.
The study design was approved on 5 March 2014 by
the Regional Ethics Review Board in Uppsala, Sweden
(approval number 2014/036).
Statistical analysis
SPSS® version 24 (IBM, Armonk, New York, USA) was
used for all statistical tests. In the multivariable analy-
ses, binary logistic regression or linear regression (Enter
method) was used, depending on the nature of the outcome
variables.

Results
From 79 386 cholecystectomy events in GallRiks and
36 098 primary RYGB events in SOReg for the period
2007–2013, cross-matching yielded 1133 patients who
underwent cholecystectomy after RYGB and 982 who had
cholecystectomy before RYGB, with no other simulta-
neous surgery during any of these procedures (Table 1).
The unadjusted outcomes summary (Table 2) showed that
patients having cholecystectomy after RYGB suffered twice
as many cholecystectomy complications as those who had
cholecystectomy before RYGB. The groups had similar
RYGB complication rates. The unadjusted aggregate com-
plication rates (the percentage of patients who had at least
one peroperative or 30-day postoperative complication of
either cholecystectomy or RYGB) were 25⋅2 versus 19⋅4
per cent for cholecystectomy after versus before RYGB.
After multivariable adjustments for age, sex and BMI
there was a higher risk for aggregate 30-day postoperative
complications (odds ratio (OR) 1⋅42, 95 per cent c.i. 1⋅13
to 1⋅79; P = 0⋅002) and aggregate combined peroperative
and 30-day postoperative complications (OR 1⋅35, 1⋅09
to 1⋅68; P = 0⋅006) when cholecystectomy was performed
after RYGB, compared with before (Table 3). Stratification
for normal intraoperative cholangiography findings (suc-
cessful cholangiography rate was 84⋅1 per cent; attempt
rate 88⋅5 per cent) did not alter this result (Table 4). The
largest differences in aggregate complication risk between
the two groups were seen after stratification for acute
cholecystectomy (OR 1⋅68, 1⋅15 to 2⋅46; P = 0⋅008) and
complicated gallstone disease (OR 1⋅52, 1⋅04 to 2⋅23;
P = 0⋅031) (Table 5). When complicated gallstone dis-
ease was the indication for cholecystectomy, there was
a higher risk of reoperation when cholecystectomy was
performed after RYGB, compared with before (OR 2⋅24,
1⋅06 to 4⋅72; P = 0⋅034). There were no significant differ-
ences in operation times between the two groups at the

and RYGB was tested as an additional explanatory variable

If there had been a complication associated with the
first procedure, there was an independently increased
risk of peroperative complications (OR 2⋅66, 95 per
cent c.i. 1⋅36 to 5⋅22; P = 0⋅004), 30-day postopera-
tive complications (OR 1⋅85, 1⋅28 to 2⋅66; P = 0⋅001)
and combined peroperative and 30-day postoperative
complications (OR 2⋅02, 1⋅44 to 2⋅85; P < 0⋅001) asso-
ciated with the second procedure, adjusted for age, sex,
BMI and order of cholecystectomy and RYGB (Table 6).
When cholecystectomy was performed simultaneously
with RYGB, the combined peroperative and 30-day
postoperative complication risk was significantly increased
(OR 1⋅72, 1⋅14 to 2⋅60; P = 0⋅010) compared with RYGB
without simultaneous cholecystectomy, adjusted for age,
sex, BMI and primary surgical approach. Simultaneous
cholecystectomy added 61⋅7 (95 per cent c.i. 56⋅1 to 67⋅4)
min (P < 0⋅001) to the duration of surgery (Table 7).

Discussion
This study has revealed a significantly higher aggregate
complication rate when cholecystectomy is performed
after, rather than before, RYGB. It also shows an asso-
ciation between complications of the first procedure and
complications of the second, regardless of the sequence
of cholecystectomy and RYGB. Furthermore, RYGB with
simultaneous cholecystectomy had a significantly higher
complication rate and took more than 1 h longer than
RYGB without cholecystectomy.
Although the study shows a statistically significant dif-
ference in complication rate depending on the order of
cholecystectomy and RYGB, it does not explain the under-
lying cause. Stratification for normal or abnormal findings
on intraoperative cholangiography did not alter the ORs
for complications substantially, which means that greater
difficulty in managing common bile duct stones after
RYGB is not sufficient to explain the results. In a previous
study8, which explored cholecystectomy complications in
patients following RYGB compared with the background
population, differences in several areas were shown such
as reoperation rates, infections and postoperative bleeding
complications. Hypothetically, nutritional factors after
RYGB could explain some of the observed differences.
The strong association between having a complication of
the first and having a complication of the second proce-
dure, regardless of the sequence of cholecystectomy and
RYGB, was likely caused by patient-specific factors such
as adhesions after previous surgery, smoking, diabetes or
other co-morbidity. However, surgical skill and the accu-
racy of registration at each surgical centre may also have
affected the results, assuming that the cholecystectomy
and the RYGB were often performed at the same centre.
For reasons of statistical power, RYGB with simultaneous
cholecystectomy could not be compared with either of the
two alternatives where cholecystectomy and RYGB were
performed on separate occasions, but only with the larger
reference base of all RYGB procedures. This implies that
the study cannot rule out RYGB with simultaneous chole-
cystectomy as an option if the patient already has symp-
tomatic gallstones before bariatric surgery. A conclusion
that may be drawn from the results, however, is that not
only peroperative complications19, but also postoperative
complications (which were at least three times more com-
mon) must be taken into account when comparing strate-
gies for the timing of cholecystectomy in relation to RYGB.
Although BMI registration in SOReg is mandatory,
it is optional in GallRiks. Therefore, BMI values from
GallRiks were not used in the statistical analyses owing to
the large number of missing data, discussed previously for
the same database8. A general limitation of a register-based
study is that there is often no way to adjust for differences
in patient selection between study groups, apart from
basic variables such as age, sex and BMI. The design of
this study, comparing two groups that underwent similar
procedures but in a different order, hopefully minimized
any confounding caused by differences in co-morbidity
between the study groups.
