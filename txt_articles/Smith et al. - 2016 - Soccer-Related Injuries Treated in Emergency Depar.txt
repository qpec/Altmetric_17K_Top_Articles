OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiology of youth soccer-related injuries treated in 
emergency departments in the United States.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of soccer-related injuries among children 
7 through 17 years of age from 1990 through 2014 with data from the National Electronic 
Injury Surveillance System. Injury rates were calculated from soccer participation data.
RESULTS: An estimated 2 995 765 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2 309 112–3 682 418) children 
7 through 17 years old were treated in US emergency departments for soccer-related 
injuries during the 25-year study period, averaging 119 831 (95% CI, 92 364–147 297) 
annually. The annual injury rate per 10 000 soccer participants increased significantly, 
by 111.4%, from 1990 to 2014. Patients 12 to 17 years old accounted for 72.7% of injuries, 
55.5% of patients were male, and most injuries occurred in a place of sport or recreation 
(68.5%) or school (25.7%). Struck by (38.5%) and fell (28.7%) were the leading mechanisms 
of injury. Injuries most commonly were diagnosed as sprain or strain (34.6%), fracture 
(23.2%), and soft tissue injury (21.9%), and occurred to the upper extremity (20.7%), ankle 
(17.8%), and head or neck (17.7%). Concussions or other closed head injuries accounted 
for 7.3% of the injuries, but the annual rate of concussions/closed head injuries per 10 000 
participants increased significantly, by 1595.6%, from 1990 to 2014.
CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to comprehensively investigate soccer-related injuries 
and calculate injury rates based on soccer participation data among children at the national 
level. The increasing number and rate of pediatric soccer-related injuries, especially soccer-
related concussions/closed head injuries, underscore the need for increased efforts to 
prevent these injuries.

Soccer is one of the most popular 
team sports in the United States, with 
>15 million participants nationally. 
1 
According to US Youth Soccer, 
there were >3 million registered 
soccer players <19 years of age in 
2014, representing an almost 90% 
increase from 1990. 
2, 
 
3 High school 
soccer participation has more than 
doubled during that time period, 
making it one of the fastest-growing 
high school sports, especially among 
girls. 
1, 
4 As participation in soccer 
has increased, so has the number of 
injuries associated with this sport. 
5, 
 
6 
An estimated 82 000 soccer-related 
injuries among children <15 years 
of age were treated in US emergency 
departments (EDs) in 2006. 
1
Despite soccer’s popularity, 
published studies about the 
epidemiology of soccer-related 
injuries among children have 
important limitations. For example, 
some studies combined children and 
adults 
6 or focused on a narrow age 
range, such as 13- to 17-year-olds 
7 
or high school students only. 
4, 
 
8 Other 
studies combined sports, 
9 were 
limited to a small number of EDs, 
teams, cities, or regions, or covered 
a short time period, such as 1 
season. 
7, 
 
10 
– 
12 Other studies were 
conducted in other countries and 
may have limited applicability to 
the United States.11 
– 
13 Among the 
large US-based studies, 2 have 
used the National Electronic Injury 
Surveillance System (NEISS) but failed 
to calculate injury rates 
6 or evaluate 
the mechanism of injury, 
 
5, 
6 and 1 is 
more than a decade old. 
5 The 2 studies 
that calculated soccer-related injury 
rates relied on population data for 
denominators rather than soccer 
participation data. 
5, 
 
14 One of these 
studies analyzed data from the NEISS 
All Injury Program and covered only 
the year 2000. 
14 Two other national 
studies examined soccer-related 
injuries only among high school 
students and were either limited to 
concussions8 or examined a brief 
time period (2005–2007). 
4
To our knowledge, this study is the 
first to comprehensively investigate 
the epidemiology of US youth 
soccer-related injuries, including the 
mechanism of injury, treated in US 
EDs, using a nationally representative 
sample and calculating injury rates 
based on national youth soccer 
participation data. It evaluates these 
injuries over a 25-year period.
METHODS
Data Source
This study retrospectively examined 
soccer-related injuries (NEISS 
code 1267) among children ages 7 
through 17 years treated in US EDs 
from 1990 through 2014. Data were 
obtained from the NEISS, which 
monitors consumer product–related 
and sports and recreational activity–
related injuries treated in US EDs. 
The NEISS, which is operated by 
the US Consumer Product Safety 
Commission, collects data from a 
network of ~100 hospitals, which 
represents a stratified probability 
sample of the >5300 hospitals in the 
United States and its territories with 
a 24-hour ED with ≥6 beds. 
15, 
 
16 
In each participating hospital, 
professional NEISS coders review 
ED medical records for information 
about in-scope injury events, 
including patient age, patient gender, 
injury diagnosis, affected body 
region, products involved, disposition 
from the ED, the location where 
injury occurred, and a brief narrative 
describing the incident. If a child 
sustains multiple injuries, only the 
most severe injury is included in the 
NEISS database.
Injury rates were calculated from 
National Sporting Goods Association 
sports participation data 
17, 
 
18 as the 
denominator (Supplemental Fig 
5). These data are based on self-
reports for people in the United 
States who are 7 to 17 years of age 
and participated in soccer at least 
once during a 12-month period from 
1990 through 2014. Participation 
data were available for children 7 
to 11 and 12 to 17 years of age, but 
not by gender for these age groups; 
therefore, gender-specific rates could 
not be calculated.
Study Variables
NEISS case narratives were reviewed 
to identify the mechanism of injury, 
which was grouped into 1 of the 
following categories: fell (including 
tripped, slipped, or fell and struck), 
collision (only player to player), 
struck by (including hit by, kicked 
by, stepped on, elbowed, or kneed), 
struck on (including ran into, hit, 
or kicked another player or object), 
struck (including unspecified 
contact such as “hit or struck during 
soccer”), twisted (including rolling 
or inversion or hyperextension of 
body region), or other. A person or 
object associated with the injury was 
classified as another player, a ball, or 
other (including wall, goalpost, pole, 
or bench). When the narrative did not 
specify another player, phrases such 
as “was elbowed, 
” “got kneed, 
” “was 
cleated, 
” or “kicked during soccer” 
were assumed to involve another 
player.
Patient age was categorized as 7 
to 11 or 12 to 17 years. Location of 
injury was grouped into sport or 
recreational place, school, or other. 
The injured body region was grouped 
into head or neck, upper extremity 
(including NEISS categories of 
shoulder, upper arm, elbow, lower 
arm, or wrist), hand or finger, trunk 
(including upper trunk, lower trunk, 
or pubic region), lower extremity 
(including upper leg and lower leg 
but excluding knee, ankle, or foot 
or toe), knee, ankle, foot or toe, or 
other. Injury diagnosis was grouped 
into concussion or other closed 
head injury (CHI; including internal 
organ injury to the head region), 
fracture, dislocation, sprain or strain, 
soft tissue injury (including NEISS 
categories of contusion, abrasion, 
hematoma, or crushing), laceration 
(including laceration, amputation,

nondental avulsion, or puncture), or 
other. Disposition from the ED was 
categorized as treated and released, 
hospitalized (including NEISS 
categories of treated and admitted, 
treated and transferred, and held for 
<24 hours for observation), or left 
against medical advice.
Statistical Analyses
Data were analyzed in SPSS version 
20.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics, IBM 
Corporation), and SAS version 
9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC) 
software. Statistical weights provided 
by the US Consumer Product 
Safety Commission were used to 
calculate national injury estimates. 
Data reported in this article are 
national estimates unless otherwise 
specified. Preliminary inspection 
of the scatterplots ( 
Figs 2,  
3, and  
4) 
indicated a shift in the rate of change 
after 2008. Therefore, piecewise 
linear regression models were 
used to analyze the overall, gender-
specific, and age group–specific 
trends with 2008 as a breakpoint. 
The estimated annual rate of change 
from the regression model, denoted 
by m, was reported along with the P 
value associated with the t test used 
to test for its statistical significance. 
If a statistically significant increase 
occurred during both periods, only 
the overall percentage increase was 
reported. Other analyses included 
the Rao–Scott χ2 test for association, 
which adjusted for the NEISS sample 
design effect, and the calculation 
of relative risk (RR) with a 95% 
confidence interval (CI). The level 
of significance used for all statistical 
tests was α = 0.05. This study was 
approved by the institutional review 
board of the authors’ institution.
RESULTS
General Characteristics
From 1990 through 2014, an 
estimated 2 995 765 (95% CI, 
2 309 112–3 682 418) children 7 
to 17 years of age were treated in 
US EDs for soccer-related injuries, 
averaging 119 831 (95% CI, 
92 364–147 297) injuries annually 
or 141.43 (95% CI, 109.01–173.84) 
per 10 000 soccer participants 7 to 
17 years old. Most injuries occurred 
at a sport or recreation place (68.5%) 
or school (25.7%), and 55.5% of 
the patients were boys ( 
Table 1). 
The number of injuries peaked at 
ages 14 and 15 years ( 
Fig 1), and 
the average age of an injured child 
was 13.2 years (SD 0.054; median 
13.0 years; interquartile range 
10.7–14.9). Children 12 to 17 years 
of age accounted for 72.7% of all 
injuries and had a higher injury rate 
per 10 000 participants (244.85; 95% 
CI, 187.91–301.79) than children 7 
to 11 years of age (66.51; 95% CI, 
51.17–81.85).
Injury Trends
From 1990 through 2014, the 
annual soccer-related injury number 
and rate per 10 000 participants 
increased significantly, by 78.4% 
(1990–2008: m = 1948.2, P < .001; 
2008–2014: m = 5166.2, P < .001) 
and by 111.4% (1990–2008: m = 
1.53, P = .003; 2008–2014: m = 15.68, 
P < .001), respectively ( 
Fig 2). Part 
of this increase was contributed by 
the increase in concussions/CHIs, 
especially after 2008 ( 
Fig 3). Over 
the entire study period, the annual 
number and rate of concussion/CHI 
per 10 000 participants increased 
significantly by 1331.7% (1990–
2008: m = 489.1, P < .001; 2008–
2014: m = 2341.3, P < .001) and by 
1595.6% (1990–2008: m = 0.53, P < 
.001; 2008–2014: m = 3.92, P < .001), 
respectively ( 
Fig 3).
From 1990 to 2008, the annual 
number of soccer injuries did not 
increase significantly for boys 
(12.2%, m = 248.6, P = .073) but 
increased significantly for girls 
(101.9%, m = 1698.9, P < .001), and 
from 2008 through 2014, the number 
of injuries leveled off for girls (2.9% 
increase, m = 616.2, P = .178) but 
increased significantly for boys 
(44.6%, m = 4554.4, P < .001) ( 
Fig 
2). Although the number of soccer 
injuries among children 7 to 11 years 
of age increased significantly during 
both periods, a significant increase 
in the injury rate occurred only from 
2008 to 2014 (61.1%, m = 7.29, P < 
.001) ( 
Fig 4). Among children 12 to 
17 years old, both the soccer-related 
injury number and rate increased 
significantly during the 2 periods 
( 
Fig 4).
Mechanism of Injury and Associated 
Person or Object
A mechanism of injury was identified 
for 66.4% of soccer-related injuries, 
and of those, struck by (38.5%), 
fell (28.7%), and twisted (12.8%) 
were the most common mechanisms 
( 
Table 1). Collision accounted for 
an additional 5.6% of the injuries. 
A person or object was associated 
with 35.0% of the injuries, and of 
those, most were another player 
(63.5%) or a ball (27.9%). Among 
injuries associated with another 
player, struck by (72.0%) and 
collision (16.8%) were the leading 
mechanisms, whereas struck by 
(77.4%) and struck on (16.2%) 
were the most common mechanisms 
associated with ball-related injuries. 
Compared with the other age group, 
younger patients (7–11 years) were 
more likely to sustain an injury 
associated with a fall (RR 1.38; 95% 
CI, 1.34–1.43) or a ball (RR 1.61; 
95% CI, 1.53–1.70), whereas older 
patients (12–17 years) were more 
likely to sustain an injury associated 
with twisting (RR 1.62; 95% CI, 
1.47–1.78) or a collision (RR 2.24; 
95% CI, 1.98–2.53). Female patients 
were more likely to experience an 
injury from a twisting mechanism 
(RR 1.36; 95% CI, 1.27–1.44) than 
male patients.
Injury Diagnosis and Injured Body 
Region
Sprain or strain accounted for 34.6% 
of injuries, followed by fracture 
(23.2%), soft tissue injury (21.9%), 
and concussion/CHI (7.3%)

( 
Table 1). Most of the fractures were 
associated with a fall (44.5%) or 
struck by (32.2%), whereas most 
soft tissue injuries were associated 
with struck by an object or person 
(58.9%). Patients who were injured 
by being struck by an object or 
person were 1.61 (95% CI, 1.51–
1.72) times more likely to sustain a 
concussion/CHI than those injured 
by other mechanisms. Compared 
with the other age group, patients 
12 to 17 years of age were more 
likely to sustain a concussion/CHI 
(RR = 1.44, 95% CI, 1.31–1.58), and 
patients 7 to 11 years old were more 
likely to sustain a fracture (RR = 1.34, 
95% CI, 1.29–1.39). Male patients 
were 3.10 times (95% CI, 2.83–3.40) 
more likely to sustain a laceration 
and 1.42 times (95% CI, 1.34–1.50) 
more likely to sustain a fracture than 
female patients. The proportion of 
concussion/CHI was higher among 
boys for patients aged 7 to 11 years 
(6.2% vs 4.5%) and among girls 
for patients aged 12 to 17 years 
(8.7% vs 7.3%).
The upper extremity (20.7%), ankle 
(17.8%), head or neck (17.7%), 
and knee (11.2%) were the most 
commonly injured body regions 
( 
Table 1). The majority of upper 
extremity injuries were associated 
with a fall (67.1%), and twisting 
accounted for 50.8% of ankle injuries. 
Patients injured by being struck by an 
object or person were more likely to 
sustain an injury to the head or neck 
(RR 1.94; 95% CI, 1.84–2.05), hand or 
finger (RR 1.81; 95% CI, 1.67–1.96), 
or lower extremity (RR 1.81; 95% CI, 
1.67–1.96) than patients injured by 
other mechanisms. Female patients 
were more likely to experience an 
ankle injury (RR 1.41; 95% CI, 1.37–
1.46) or knee injury (RR 1.29; 95% 
CI, 1.22–1.37) than male patients.
Disposition From the Emergency 
Department
Most children with a soccer-related 
injury were treated and released 
from the ED (98.3%) ( 
Table 1). 
Among those admitted to the 
hospital, 70.4% were boys, and 
60.6% sustained a fracture. Patients 
were more likely to be admitted to 
the hospital if they had a fracture 
(RR 5.10; 95% CI, 4.19–6.22) or a 
concussion/CHI (RR 2.06; 95% CI, 
1.52–2.77) than patients with other 
injury diagnoses.
DISCUSSION
During the 25-year study period, 
almost 3 million children 7 to 17 
years of age were treated for soccer-
related injuries in US EDs, and the 
injury rate more than doubled. 
Our findings are consistent with 
those of previous studies, which 
showed an increase in the number of 
pediatric soccer-related injuries 
6, 
 
19 
and an increase in the number and 
population-based rate of soccer-
related injuries among girls. 
5 The 
increase in the number of injuries 
treated in US EDs is a trend that also 
was observed for other pediatric 
sports from 2001 to 2013. 
19 In our 
study, more than two-thirds (72.7%) 
of injuries occurred among children 
12 to 17 years of age, and the rate of 
injury was >3 times higher in this age 
group than among younger soccer 
participants, probably because of 
the more aggressive play and the 
higher-energy impacts associated 
with the older age group. Although 
we were not able to calculate gender-
specific injury rates because soccer 
participation data by gender were 
unavailable, the number of soccer-
related injuries increased for both 
genders, with a greater increase 
among girls. This result is expected, 
given the much larger increase in 
soccer participation by girls than 
boys during the study period.4
Although concussions/CHIs only 
accounted for 7.3% of injuries, both 
the number and rate increased 
>13-fold over the study period 
and contributed to the observed 
increase in soccer injuries overall. 
One study reported a similar 
percentage (10.8%) of concussions 
among high school soccer-related

SMITH et al 
injuries during 2005 to 2007, 
 
4 and 
others have reported an increase 
in concussions among youth 
athletes during the past 10 to 15 
years in the United States. 
20 
 
–23 The 
reasons for this observed increase 
are unknown, but several factors 
may have contributed. First, the 
incidence of concussion/CHI among 
youth soccer players may, in fact, 
be increasing. In addition, there has 
been a growing awareness among 
players, coaches, athletic trainers, 
medical professionals, and the public 
in general about the potentially 
serious consequences of sports-
related concussion. Many states have 
passed youth sports concussion laws 
since 2009. 
24 This awareness may 
have led to better recognition of 
concussions and referrals to EDs by 
soccer coaches and athletic trainers. 
Parents may have lower thresholds 
for taking their child to the ED for 
evaluation of a suspected concussion. 
ED medical personnel also may 
be diagnosing and documenting 
suspected concussion more often 
in recent years. The sharp increase 
after 2008 in concussions/CHIs in 
this study also has been observed in 
other youth sports, 
 
22 especially youth 
football. 
23
In our study, patients with a 
concussion/CHI were twice as likely 
to be admitted to the hospital as 
patients with other diagnoses. This 
finding highlights the potential 
severity of these injuries. Patients 
12 to 17 years of age were more 
likely to sustain a concussion/CHI 
than younger patients. The more 
aggressive play in this age group is 
a likely contributor to this finding. 
Injuries sustained by being struck 
by an object or person were more 
likely to occur to the head or neck 
region and were more likely to result 
in a concussion/CHI than other 
mechanisms of injury. According 
to previous studies, heading the 
ball and player-to-player contact 
were the most common activity 
and mechanism, respectively,

associated with concussion among 
high school players. 
8, 
 
25 The US 
Soccer Federation implemented 
new guidelines in January 2016 that 
eliminate heading for children ≤10 
years of age and limit the amount 
of heading in practice for children 
11 to 13 years of age. 
26 Concussions 
among youth athletes can have 
serious consequences. Young 
athletes recover more slowly from 
concussions and repeat concussions 
than their college counterparts. 
27– 
29 
They are at risk for second-impact 
syndrome if they return to play 
prematurely, and repetitive 
concussions over years may put them 
at risk for other neurobehavioral and 
cognitive changes, including chronic 
traumatic encephalopathy. 
30, 
 
31
Sprain or strain and fracture were 
the most common diagnoses, a 
finding that is consistent with 
previous studies. 
4 
– 
6, 
 
14 As others have 
previously reported, 
10, 
 
32, 
 
33 sprains 
or strains occurred commonly to 
the ankles and knees, probably 
because of the cutting and pivoting 
maneuvers that are common in 
soccer and because of uneven playing 
fields. Older patients (12–17 years 
of age) and girls were more likely 
to sustain a sprain or strain than 
younger patients and boys. The 
higher incidence of knee injuries, 
and anterior cruciate ligament 
injuries specifically, among female 
soccer players has been previously 
reported. 
32, 
 
34 
– 
37 The effectiveness 
of prevention interventions on 
anterior cruciate ligament injury 
rates in soccer is inconsistent. 
38 In 
contrast, 7- to 11-year-old patients 
and male patients were more likely 
to sustain a fracture than patients 
who were older or female. In part 
this difference may be due to more 
physical play by boys and to the 
fact that young children commonly 
fall forward onto outstretched 
arms, which often results in upper 
extremity fractures. Indeed, in this 
study patients 7 to 11 years were 
more likely to sustain an injury to the 
hand or finger or another part of the 
upper extremity than older patients. 
Fractures were among the most 
serious injuries in this study; patients 
with a fracture were >5 times more 
likely to be admitted to the hospital 
than patients with other diagnoses. 
Fractures accounted for >60% of 
hospital admissions.
The increasing number and rate of 
soccer-related injuries, especially 
concussions/CHIs, demonstrated 
in this study underscore the need 
for increased injury prevention 
efforts. Education of players, coaches, 
referees or officials, and parents 
about the importance of following the 
rules of the game, and enforcement 
of those rules, are critical first 
steps. 
12, 
 
34, 
 
39 One study found that 
12% of all soccer competition injuries 
were related to illegal activity, and 
of these 25% were concussions. 
4 
Concussion prevention should focus 
on reducing player-to-player contact, 
some of which results from illegal 
activity. Protective headgear and 
ball heading are areas that deserve 
continued research and review.40 
Return-to-play and concussion 
management guidelines should be 
followed. Low neck strength has 
been shown to be associated with 
increased risk of concussion among 
high school athletes. 
41 Preseason 
neck strength screening and neck 
muscle strengthening interventions 
may be of benefit in preventing 
concussions. More research is needed 
in these areas and on the effect of 
state sports-related concussion laws. 
42
There are several limitations to 
this study. Only cases treated in 
EDs were included in this study. 
Patients treated in non-ED health 
care settings, and those not seeking 
treatment, are not captured by 
the NEISS database. Therefore, 
the number of soccer-related 
injuries was underestimated in 
this study, and study findings may 
not be representative of all soccer-
related injuries. Furthermore, 
NEISS case information is limited 
by the information documented 
in ED records and NEISS case 
narratives. NEISS case narratives 
did not consistently contain detailed 
information about the mechanism 
of injury and factors contributing to 
the injury event. Although rates and 
patterns of injuries associated with 
practice and competition differ, 
 
43 
we were unable to determine during 
which of these activities the injuries 
included in this study occurred. 
Some injuries also may have involved 
soccer equipment, but not soccer

SMITH et al 
activity, such as tripping on a soccer 
ball on the ground. NEISS does not 
have a variable for injury severity, 
and the use of hospital admission 
as a proxy measure of severity is 
a limitation of this study because 
factors other than injury severity can 
influence the decision to admit to the 
hospital. Soccer participation data 
were not available by gender, which 
precluded calculation of gender-
specific injury rates. Despite these 
limitations, the strength of this study 
lies in its use of a large, nationally 
representative sample over a period 
of 25 years and its calculation 
of injury rates based on soccer 
participation data.
CONCLUSIONS
This study is the first to 
comprehensively investigate 
soccer-related injuries and calculate 
injury rates based on soccer 
participation data among children 
at the national level. The increasing 
number and rate of pediatric 
soccer-related injuries, especially 
concussions/CHIs, underscore the 
need for increased efforts to prevent 
these injuries.
