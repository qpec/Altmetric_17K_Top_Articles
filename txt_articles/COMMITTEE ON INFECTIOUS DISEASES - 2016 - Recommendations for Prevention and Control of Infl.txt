abstract
The purpose of this statement is to update recommendations for the 
routine use of seasonal infl
 uenza vaccine and antiviral medications for the 
prevention and treatment of infl
 uenza in children. The AAP recommends 
annual seasonal infl
 uenza immunization for everyone 6 months and older, 
including children and adolescents. Highlights for the upcoming 2016–2017 
season include the following: 
1. Annual universal infl
 uenza immunization is indicated with either a 
trivalent or quadrivalent (no preference) inactivated vaccine.
2. The 2016–2017 infl
 uenza A (H3N2) vaccine strain differs from that contained 
in the 2015–2016 seasonal vaccines. The 2016–2017 infl
 uenza B vaccine strain 
(Victoria lineage) included in the trivalent vaccine differs from that contained in 
the 2015–2016 seasonal trivalent vaccines (Yamagata lineage).
 a.  
Trivalent vaccine contains an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09–like 
virus, an A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2)–like virus, and a 
B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus (B/Victoria lineage).
 b.  
Quadrivalent vaccine contains an additional B virus 
(B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus [B/Yamagata lineage]).
3. Quadrivalent live attenuated infl
 uenza vaccine (LAIV4) should not be used 
in any setting during the 2016–2017 infl
 uenza season in light of the evidence 
for poor effectiveness of LAIV4 in recent seasons, particularly against 
infl
 uenza A (H1N1)pdm09 viruses.
4. All children with egg allergy can receive infl
 uenza vaccine with no 
additional precautions from those of routine vaccinations.
5. All HCP should receive an annual infl
 uenza vaccine, a crucial step in 
preventing infl
 uenza and reducing health care–associated infl
 uenza 
infections. Because HCP may care for or live with people at high risk of 
infl
 uenza-related complications, it is especially important for them to get 
vaccinated annually.
6. Pediatricians should attempt to promptly identify children suspected of 
having infl
 uenza for rapid antiviral treatment, when indicated, to reduce 
morbidity and mortality.

INTRODUCTION
The American Academy of 
Pediatrics (AAP) recommends 
annual seasonal influenza 
vaccination for everyone 6 months 
and older, including children and 
adolescents, during the 2016–
2017 influenza season. Special 
effort should be made to vaccinate 
people in the following groups:
 
• all children, including infants 
born preterm, aged 6 months 
and older (based on chronologic 
age) with conditions that increase 
the risk of complications from 
influenza (eg, children with 
chronic medical conditions, 
such as asthma, diabetes 
mellitus, hemodynamically 
significant cardiac disease, 
immunosuppression, or neurologic 
and neurodevelopmental 
disorders);
 
• all household contacts and out-of-
home care providers of children 
with high-risk conditions and those 
younger than 5 years, especially 
infants younger than 6 months;
 
• American Indian/Alaska Native 
children;
 
• all health care personnel (HCP);
 
• all child care providers and staff; 
and
 
• all women who are pregnant, 
are considering pregnancy, are 
in the postpartum period, or are 
breastfeeding during the influenza 
season.
KEY POINTS RELEVANT FOR THE 2016–
2017 INFLUENZA SEASON
1. Annual seasonal influenza 
vaccine is recommended 
for everyone 6 months and 
older, including children 
and adolescents, during the 
2016–2017 influenza season. 
It is important that household 
contacts and out-of-home care 
providers of children younger 
than 5 years, especially infants 
younger than 6 months, and 
children of any age at high 
risk of complications from 
influenza (eg, children with 
chronic medical conditions, 
such as asthma, diabetes 
mellitus, hemodynamically 
significant cardiac disease, 
immunosuppression, 
or neurologic and 
neurodevelopmental disorders) 
receive annual influenza vaccine. 
In the United States, more than 
two-thirds of children younger 
than 6 years and almost all 
children 6 years and older spend 
significant time in child care or 
school settings outside the home. 
Exposure to groups of children 
increases the risk of contracting 
infectious diseases. Children 
younger than 2 years are at 
increased risk of hospitalization 
and complications attributable 
to influenza. School-aged 
children bear a large influenza 
disease burden and have a 
significantly higher chance 
of seeking influenza-related 
medical care compared with 
healthy adults. Reducing 
influenza virus transmission 
(eg, by using appropriate 
hand hygiene and respiratory 
hygiene/cough etiquette) among 
children who attend out-of-home 
child care or school has been 
shown to decrease the burden 
of childhood influenza and the 
transmission of influenza virus 
to household contacts and 
community members of all ages.
2. The 2015–
2016 influenza season 
was moderate overall, with 
lower levels of influenza activity, 
outpatient illness, influenza-
associated hospitalization, and 
pediatric deaths compared with 
the previous season. Although 
the start of the season was 
typical in the United States, 
with increasing activity noted 
in January 2016, activity peaked 
in mid-March, which was later 
than in the previous 3 seasons. 
The influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 
viruses predominated overall, 
influenza A (H3N2) viruses were 
more commonly identified from 
October through early December, 
and influenza B viruses were 
more commonly identified from 
mid-April through mid-May. The 
majority of circulating strains 
matched vaccine strains well. 
Pediatric hospitalizations and 
deaths caused by influenza vary 
by the predominant circulating 
strain and from 1 season to 
the next ( 
Table 1). Historically, 
80% to 85% of pediatric deaths 
have occurred in unvaccinated 
children aged 6 months and 
older. In the past 10 seasons, 
the rates of hospitalization for 
children younger than 5 years 
have always exceeded the 
rates for children 5 through 17 
years of age. As of August 20, 
2016, the following data were 
reported by the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) during the 2015–
2016 
influenza season: 85 laboratory-
confirmed influenza-associated 
pediatric deaths occurred; 
53 of these were associated 
with influenza A viruses, 28 
of these were associated with 
influenza B viruses, and 3 of 
these were associated with an 
undetermined type of influenza 
virus.Although children with 
certain conditions are at higher 
risk of complications, 59.7% of 
the deaths occurred in children 
with no high-risk underlying 
medical condition. Among 
children hospitalized with 
influenza and for whom medical 
chart data were available, 
approximately 50% had no 
recorded underlying condition, 
whereas approximately 21% had 
underlying asthma or reactive 
airway disease ( 
Fig 1).

effectiveness of quadrivalent

live attenuated influenza vaccine

the past 3 seasons, particularly 
against influenza A (H1N1)
pdm09 viruses, LAIV4 should 
not be used in any setting during 
the 2016–
2017 season. In the 
2015–

vaccine effectiveness of any 
vaccine (inactivated influenza 
vaccine [IIV] or live attenuated 
influenza vaccine [LAIV]) 
against influenza A and B was

[CI]: 39% to 53%) according to 
observational data from the US 
Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness 
Network. However, relative 
vaccine effectiveness against 
both influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 
viruses (the predominant 
influenza strain this season) 
and influenza B viruses strongly 
favored IIV over LAIV4 among 
children 2 through 17 years of 
age. LAIV4 was not significantly 
effective against any influenza 
(all A and B viruses combined) 
among children 2 through 17 
years of age ( 
Table 2). In all 
pediatric age groups for all 3 
seasons, LAIV4 did not have any 
statistically significant benefit 
in preventing influenza (all 95% 
CIs cross zero), whereas IIV 
provided statistically significant 
protection, albeit to differing 
degrees by season ( 
Table 2). 
Children who received LAIV4 
had more than 2.5 times higher 
odds of developing influenza 
attributable to any virus type 
compared with children who 
received IIV. For influenza 
A (H1N1)pdm09 viruses 
in particular, LAIV4 had an 
adjusted vaccine effectiveness of 
–
21% (95% CI: –
108% to 30%) 
compared with 65% for IIV (95% 
CI: 49% to 76%). The adjusted 
odds ratio was 3.67, indicating 
that children who received 
LAIV4 were almost 4 times more 
likely to get influenza than those 
who received IIV. In the 2014–
2015 influenza season, data 
from the US Influenza Vaccine 
Effectiveness Network indicated 
that vaccine effectiveness 
of both IIV and LAIV4 was 
reduced against influenza A 
(H3N2) viruses for all age 
groups because of antigenic 
drift of the predominantly 
circulating A (H3N2) viruses. 
During the 2013–
2014 season, 
observational data from the US 
Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness 
Network and 2 additional 
studies showed that LAIV4 
was not effective against the 
predominantly circulating 
influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 
viruses when compared with 
IIV in children aged 2 through 
8 years. Additional research 
will help determine whether 
the interim recommendation 
that LAIV4 should not be used 
in any setting will continue for 
subsequent influenza seasons. 
Current focus should be on 
the administration of IIV for 
all children and adolescents, 
particularly those with 
underlying medical conditions 
associated with an elevated risk 
of complications from influenza. 
4. Vaccination remains the 
best available preventive 
measure against influenza. 
Given the unpredictable nature 
of influenza each season, any 
licensed and age-appropriate IIV 
available should be used. The 
vaccine strains are predicted to 
be well matched to circulating 
strains with the intent of 
providing optimal protection. 
Vaccination is effective in 
reducing outpatient medical 
visits for illness caused by 
circulating influenza viruses 
by 50% to 75%. The universal 
administration of seasonal 
vaccine to everyone 6 months 
and older is still the best strategy 
available for preventing illness 
from influenza.
5. Both trivalent and quadrivalent 
IIVs are available in the United 
States for the 2016–
2017 
season. To vaccinate as many 
people as possible for this 
influenza season, neither 
inactivated vaccine formulation 
is preferred over the other. 
Although manufacturers 
anticipate an increasing 
amount of quadrivalent 
vaccine, pediatricians should 
give whichever formulation is 
available in their communities. 
Both formulations contain 
an A/California/7/2009 
(H1N1)pdm09–
like virus, 
an A/HongKong/4801/2014 
(H3N2)–
like virus, and a 
B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus 
(B/Victoria lineage). Quadrivalent 
influenza vaccines contain the 
B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus 
(B/Yamagata lineage) as well. 
The influenza A (H3N2) virus in 
both formulations differs from 
that contained in the 2015–
2016 seasonal vaccines. The 
influenza B virus in the trivalent 
formulation is the opposite 
lineage from that in last season’s 
trivalent vaccine.
6. The number of seasonal 
influenza vaccine doses to be 
administered in the 2016–
2017 
influenza season depends on the

child’s age at the time of the first 
administered dose and his or her 
vaccine history ( 
Fig 2): 
• Influenza vaccines are not 
licensed for administration to 
infants younger than 6 months.
• Children aged 9 years and older 
need only 1 dose.
• Children 6 months through 8 
years of age:
 
◾ Need 2 doses if they have 
received fewer than 2 doses 
of any trivalent or 
quadrivalent influenza 
vaccine (IIV or LAIV) before 
July 1, 2016. The interval 
between the 2 doses should 
be at least 4 weeks.
 
◾ Require only 1 dose if they 
have previously received 2 
or more total doses of any 
trivalent or quadrivalent 
influenza vaccine (IIV or LAIV) 
before July 1, 2016. The 2 
previous doses do not need 
to have been received during 
the same influenza season or 
consecutive influenza seasons. 
Despite recent evidence for 
poor effectiveness of LAIV4, 
receipt of LAIV4 in the past is 
still expected to have primed a 
child’s immune system. There 
currently are no data that 
suggest otherwise. Therefore, 
children who received 2 or 
more doses of LAIV4 before 
July 1, 2016 may receive 
only 1 dose of IIV for the 
2016–
2017 season. Given 
the continuing circulation 
of H1N1pdm09 viruses as 
the predominant influenza A 
(H1N1) strain since 2009 and 
its inclusion in all seasonal 
influenza vaccines since the 
2010–
2011 season, this virus 
is no longer believed to be 
antigenically novel; therefore, 
special consideration with 
respect to vaccine policy is no 
longer necessary. Vaccination 
should not be delayed to 
obtain a specific product for 
either dose. Any available, 
age-appropriate trivalent 
or quadrivalent inactivated 
vaccine can be used. A child 
who receives only 1 of the 
2 doses as a quadrivalent 
formulation is likely to be less 
primed against the additional 
B virus.
7. Pediatric offices may choose to 
serve as an alternate venue for 
providing influenza vaccination 
for parents and other care 
providers of children, if the 
practice is acceptable to both 
pediatricians and the adults 
who are to be vaccinated. 
1 
Medical liability issues and 
medical record documentation 
requirements need to be 
considered before a pediatrician 
begins immunizing adults (see 
details at www. 
aapredbook. 
org/ 
implementation). Pediatricians 
are reminded to document 
the recommendation for adult 
vaccination in the child’s medical 
record. In addition, adults should 
still be encouraged to have a 
medical home and communicate 
their vaccination status to 
their primary care provider. 
Offering adult vaccinations in the 
pediatric practice setting would 
not be intended to undermine 
the adult medical home model 
but could serve as an additional 
venue for parents and other care 
providers of children to receive 
influenza vaccines. Vaccination 
of close contacts of children at 
high risk of influenza-related 
complications ( 
Table 3) is 
intended to reduce their risk of 
contagion (ie, “cocooning”). The 
practice of cocooning also will 
help protect infants younger 
than 6 months who are too 
young to be immunized with 
influenza vaccine. 
8. Pregnant women can receive 
influenza vaccine safely at any 
time during pregnancy. Pregnant 
women are of special concern 
because they are at high risk of 
complications from influenza. 
Vaccination of pregnant women

also provides protection for 
their infants, potentially for 
as long as 6 months through 
the transplacental transfer 
of antibodies. For example, 1 
recent study documented that 
infants born to women reporting 
influenza vaccination during 
pregnancy had risk reductions 
of 70% for laboratory-confirmed 
influenza and 81% for influenza 
hospitalizations in their first 6 
months.
9. Once seasonal influenza vaccine 
is available locally, pediatricians 
or vaccine administrators 
should encourage immunization 
of HCP, notify parents and 
caregivers of vaccine availability 
and the importance of annual 
vaccination, and immunize 
children 6 months and older 
per recommendations, 
especially those at high risk of 
complications from influenza. 
HCP should ideally provide 
vaccination by the end of 
October, if possible. This is 
particularly important for 
children who need 2 doses of 
influenza vaccine to achieve 
optimal protection before 
the circulation of influenza 
viruses in the community. 
Provider endorsement 
plays a major role in patient 
acceptance and vaccine uptake. 
Prompt initiation of influenza 
vaccination and continuing 
to vaccinate throughout the 
influenza season, whether 
influenza is circulating (or has 
circulated) in the community, 
are important components of an 
effective vaccination strategy. 
Although there is no evidence 
that waning immunity from 
administering the vaccine early 
increases the risk of infection in 
children, recent literature raises 
the possibility that very early 
vaccination of adults, particularly 
the elderly, might contribute to 
reduced protection later in the 
influenza season. Until there 
is definitive information that 
determines whether waning 
immunity influences vaccine 
effectiveness, the influenza 
vaccine should not be delayed 
until a later date, because this 
increases the likelihood of 
missing influenza vaccination 
altogether. Further evaluation is 
needed before any policy change 
in timing is made.
10. Providers may continue to 
offer vaccine until June 30th of 
each year, marking the end of 
the influenza season, because 
influenza is so unpredictable. 
Protective immune responses 
generally persist in children 
throughout the influenza season. 
Although peak influenza activity 
in the United States tends to 
occur in January through March, 
influenza activity can occur in 
early fall (October) or in late 
spring (end of May) and may 
have more than 1 disease peak. 
This approach also provides 
ample opportunity to administer 
a second dose of vaccine to 
children 6 months through 8 
years of age when indicated, as 
detailed previously in key point 
6. This approach also allows 
for optimal ability to immunize 
international travelers, who may 
be exposed to influenza year-
round, depending on destination.
11. HCP, influenza campaign 
organizers, and public health 
agencies are encouraged to 
collaborate to develop improved 
strategies for planning, 
distribution, communication, and 
administration of vaccines.
• Plan to make seasonal influenza 
vaccine easily accessible for 
all children. Examples include 
sending alerts to families that 
vaccine is available (eg, e-mails, 
texts, letters, and patient 
portals); creating walk-in 
influenza vaccination clinics; 
extending hours beyond routine 
times during peak vaccination 
periods; administering influenza 
vaccine during both well and 
sick visits; considering how 
to immunize parents, adult 
caregivers, and siblings at the 
same time in the same office 
setting as children 
1; and working 
with other institutions (eg, 
schools, child care programs, 
local public health departments, 
and religious organizations) 
or alternative care sites, such 
as emergency departments, to 
expand venues for administering 
vaccine. If a child receives an 
influenza vaccine outside of his 
or her medical home, such as at 
a pharmacy, retail-based clinic, 
or another practice, appropriate 
documentation of vaccination 
should be provided to the patient 
for his or her medical home 
and entered into the state or 
regional immunization registry 
as required by state law.
• Concerted efforts among 
the aforementioned groups, 
plus vaccine manufacturers, 
distributors, and payers, also 
are necessary to prioritize 
distribution appropriately to 
the primary care office setting 
and patient-centered medical 
home before other venues, 
especially when vaccine supplies 
are delayed or limited. Similar 
efforts should be made to 
assuage the vaccine supply 
discrepancy between privately 
insured patients and those 
eligible for vaccination through 
the Vaccines for Children 
program. Without an intranasal 
influenza vaccine recommended 
for this 2016–
2017 season, 
the AAP is working closely 
with manufacturers to make 
available an adequate supply 
with geographically wide and 
timely distribution of inactivated 
vaccine products for pediatric-
aged patients.

• Public health will benefit from 
pediatricians’ discussions about 
vaccine safety, effectiveness, 
and indications, particularly 
since LAIV4 should not be used 
during the 2016–
2017 season 
because of its poor effectiveness 
against influenza A (H1N1)
pdm09 viruses during the 
2013–
2014 and 2015–
2016 
influenza seasons in the United 
States. Pediatricians can 
influence vaccine acceptance 
by explaining the importance 
of annual influenza vaccination 
for children, emphasizing when 
a second dose of vaccine is 
indicated, and explaining why 
the intranasal formulation is 
not available this season. The 
AAP and CDC are developing 
communication resources 
to convey these important 
messages and to help the public 
understand this influenza 
recommendation. Resources will 
be available on Red Book Online 
(www. 
aapredbook. 
org/ 
flu ).
• HCP should act as role models 
for both their patients and 
colleagues by receiving 
influenza vaccination annually 
and by letting others know 
that they have received 
vaccine, highlighting the safety 
and effectiveness of annual 
influenza vaccination. Influenza 
vaccination programs for HCP 
benefit the health of employees, 
their patients, and members 
of the community. Mandatory 
influenza immunization for 
all HCP is ethical, just, and 
necessary to improve patient 
safety. 
2 Employees of health care 
institutions are obligated to act 
in the best interests of the health 
of their patients and to honor the 
requirement of causing no harm.
12. Antiviral medications also are 
important in the control of 
influenza but are not a substitute 
for influenza vaccination. The 
neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) 
oral oseltamivir (Tamiflu; 
Roche Laboratories, Nutley, 
NJ) and inhaled zanamivir 
(Relenza; GlaxoSmithKline, 
Research Triangle Park, NC) are 
the only antiviral medications 
that are recommended for 
chemoprophylaxis or treatment 
of influenza in children during 
the 2016–
2017 season. 
Peramivir (Rapivab; BioCryst 
Pharmaceuticals, Durham, 
NC), a third NAI, was licensed 
on December 19, 2014, for 
use in adults 18 years or 
older and is being studied 
in children. Intravenous use 
of peramivir is approved for 
adults. Intravenous zanamivir 
remains investigational but can 
be used in consultation with 
infectious diseases specialists, 
and it may also be obtained 
on a compassionate-use basis 
for seriously ill children, as 
currently supported by the US 
Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) through the manufacturer, 
GlaxoSmithKline. This 
information is especially 
important for those who are 
immunocompromised or who 
cannot tolerate or absorb orally 
or enterically administered 
oseltamivir. Intravenous 
zanamivir is being studied 
in pediatric patients, but the 
manufacturer has not publicly 
released any information 
regarding any plans to file for 
licensure in adults or children. 
Recent viral surveillance and 
resistance data from the CDC and 
the World Health Organization 
(WHO) indicate that the majority 
of currently circulating influenza 
viruses likely to cause influenza 
in North America during the 
2016–
2017 season continue to 
be susceptible to oseltamivir, 
zanamivir, and peramivir. If a 
newly emergent oseltamivir- or 
peramivir-resistant virus is a 
concern, the use of intravenous 
zanamivir may be feasible. 
Amantadine and rimantadine 
(adamantanes that block M2 
proton channels) should not 
be used to treat influenza in 
2016–
2017, because circulating 
influenza A viruses continue to 
have extremely high levels of 
resistance to these drugs, which 
also are not effective against 
influenza B viruses. Because 
resistance characteristics can 
change over the duration of a 
treatment course, especially in 
severely immunocompromised 
people who may receive 
prolonged courses, pediatricians 
can verify susceptibility data 
for circulating strains at the 
start of the influenza season and 
monitor the data throughout the 
season. Up-to-date information 
can be found on the AAP Web 
site (www. 
aap. 
org or www. 
aapredbook. 
org/ 
flu), through 
state-specific AAP chapter Web 
sites, or on the CDC Web site 
(www. 
cdc. 
gov/ 
flu/ 
index. 
htm).
SEASONAL INFLUENZA VACCINES
Before the 2013–
2014 influenza 
season, only trivalent influenza 
vaccines that included a single 
influenza B strain were available. 
Since the 1980s, 2 antigenically 
distinct lineages (ie, Victoria or 
Yamagata) of influenza B viruses 
have circulated globally. Vaccination 
against 1 B viral lineage confers little 
cross-protection against the other B 
viral lineage. Thus, trivalent vaccines 
offer limited immunity against 
circulating influenza B strains of the 
lineage not present in the vaccine. 
Furthermore, in recent years, it 
has proven difficult to predict 
consistently which B lineage will 
predominate during a given influenza 
season. Therefore, a quadrivalent 
influenza vaccine with influenza 
B strains of both lineages would 
be predicted to offer additional 
protection, but there is no evidence

 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
at this time that quadrivalent vaccine 
is more effective.
IIVs
For the 2016–
2017 season, IIVs 
will be available for intramuscular 
injection in both trivalent (IIV3) and 
quadrivalent (IIV4) formulations. 
IIVs do not contain live virus. The 
available intramuscular formulations 
and age groups for which use is 
approved are presented in  
Table 4. 
The intramuscular formulations can 
be used in children with and without 
chronic medical conditions. The most 
common adverse events after IIV3 
administration are local injection site 
pain and tenderness. Fever occurs 
within 24 hours after immunization 
in approximately 10% to 35% of 
children younger than 2 years but 
rarely in older children and adults. 
Mild systemic symptoms, such as 
nausea, lethargy, headache, muscle 
aches, and chills, may occur after 
administration of IIV3.
Intramuscular formulations of 
IIV4 are available from several 
manufacturers. Different 
formulations have different age 
indications, but there are brands 
licensed for use in children as young 
as 6 months of age. In children, 
the most common injection site 
adverse reactions were pain, 
redness, and swelling. The most 
common systemic adverse events 
were drowsiness, irritability, 
loss of appetite, fatigue, muscle 
aches, headache, arthralgia, and 
gastrointestinal tract symptoms. 
These events were reported with 
comparable frequency among 
participants receiving the licensed 
comparator IIV3. IIV4 is an 
acceptable vaccine for people 6 
months or older when otherwise 
appropriate and may offer broader 
protection against circulating 
influenza B strains than IIV3.
An intradermal formulation of 
IIV4 is licensed and available 
for use in persons 18 through 
64 years of age. Intradermal 
vaccine administration involves 
a microinjection with a shorter 
needle than needles used for 
intramuscular administration. 
The most common adverse events 
are redness, induration, swelling, 
pain, and itching, which occur at 
the site of administration. There 
is no preference for intramuscular 
or intradermal immunization with 
IIV4 in persons 18 through 64 years 
of age. Therefore, pediatricians 
may choose to use either the 
intramuscular or intradermal 
product for their young adult 
patients and for any adults they are 
vaccinating in their office.

During the 2 influenza seasons 
spanning 2010–
2012, there 
were increased reports of febrile 
seizures in the United States in 
young children who received IIV3 
and the 13-valent pneumococcal 
conjugate vaccine (PCV [PCV13]) 
concomitantly. Subsequent 
retrospective analyses of past 
seasons have revealed a slight 
increase in the risk of febrile seizures 
in children 6 through 23 months 
of age when vaccines are given 
concomitantly with IIV. For example, 
although 1 study found that IIV3 
was not independently associated 
with a risk of febrile seizures, an 
increased risk of febrile seizures was 
noted when IIV3 was administered 
on the same day as either PCV 
or diphtheria-tetanus-acellular 
pertussis (DTaP) vaccine. Data on 
which dose in the series for either of 
these vaccines were not documented. 
The concomitant administration of 
IIV3, PCV, and DTaP was associated 
with the greatest relative risk 
estimate, corresponding to a 
maximum additional 30 febrile 
seizure cases per 100 000 children 
vaccinated, compared with the 
administration of the vaccines on 
separate days. In contrast, data 
from the FDA’s Postlicensure Rapid 
Immunization Safety Monitoring 
(PRISM) program, the largest 
vaccine safety surveillance program 
in the United States, revealed that 
there was no significant increase 
in febrile seizures associated with 
concomitant administration of 
these 3 vaccines in children 6 to 
59 months of age during the 
2010–
2011 season. Although the 
possibility of increased risk of 
febrile seizures cannot be ruled out, 
simultaneous administration of IIV 
with PCV13 and/or other vaccines 
for the 2016–
2017 influenza season 
continues to be recommended when 
these vaccines are indicated. Overall, 
the benefits of timely vaccination 
with same-day administration of 
IIV and PCV or DTaP outweigh the 
risk of febrile seizures, which rarely 
have any long-term sequelae, with 
simultaneous administration.
Two trivalent influenza vaccines 
manufactured with the use of newer 
technologies will also be available 
for people 18 years or older during 
the 2016–
2017 season: trivalent 
recombinant hemagglutinin influenza 
vaccine (RIV3) and trivalent cell 
culture–
based inactivated influenza 
vaccine (ccIIV3), both administered 
intramuscularly. RIV3 is a 
recombinant baculovirus-expressed 
hemagglutinin vaccine produced 
in cell culture. The most frequently 
reported adverse events after the 
administration of RIV3 and ccIIV3 are 
pain, headache, myalgia, and fatigue. 
RIV3 and ccIIV3 have been shown 
to be efficacious against influenza 
disease in randomized controlled 
efficacy trials. A quadrivalent cell 
culture–
based inactivated influenza 
vaccine (ccIIV4), administered 
intramuscularly, also will be available 
for people 4 years and older during 
the 2016–
2017 season. Studies 
showed noninferiority of ccIIV4 
compared with ccIIV3; ccIIV4 elicited 
a robust immune response in both 
children and adults. ccIIV4 has a 
similar safety profile to ccIIV3 and 
other licensed trivalent influenza 
vaccines. In children aged 4 through 
17 years, injection site tenderness 
and erythema were the most 
common (≥10%) local reactions, 
and the most common (≥10%) 
systemic reactions included 
sleepiness/fatigue and irritability/
headache.
In November 2015, the FDA licensed 
a trivalent, MF-59–
adjuvanted 
IIV for people 65 years and older. 
This vaccine is the first adjuvanted 
influenza vaccine marketed in the 
United States. Adjuvants elicit a 
more robust immune response, 
which could lead to a reduction in 
the number of doses required for 
children. The vaccine is currently 
being studied in children.
 
Table 4 summarizes information 
on the types of IIVs licensed for 
children and adults during the 
2016–
2017 season. More than 1 
product may be appropriate for a 
given patient. Vaccination should 
not be delayed to obtain a specific 
product.
A large body of scientific evidence 
shows that thimerosal-containing 
vaccines are not associated with an 
increased risk of autism spectrum 
disorders in children. Thimerosal 
from vaccines has not been linked 
to any other medical condition. As 
such, the AAP extends its strongest 
support to the current WHO 
recommendations to retain the use 
of thimerosal as a preservative in 
multiuse vials in the global vaccine 
supply. Some people may still 
raise concerns about the minute 
amounts of thimerosal in some IIV 
formulations ( 
Table 4), and in some 
states, including California, Delaware, 
Illinois, Missouri, New York, and 
Washington, there is legislated 
restriction on the use of thimerosal-
containing vaccines. The benefits 
of protecting children against the 
known risks of influenza are clear. 
Therefore, to the extent authorized 
by state law, children should receive 
any available formulation of IIV 
rather than delaying vaccination 
while waiting for reduced-
thimerosal-content or thimerosal-
free vaccines. Although some 
formulations of IIV contain a trace 
amount of thimerosal, thimerosal-
free IIV products can be obtained 
( 
Table 4). Vaccine manufacturers 
are delivering increasing amounts 
of thimerosal-free influenza vaccine 
each year.
Vaccine Effectiveness and LAIV
The AAP supports the decision by 
the CDC that LAIV4 not be used in 
any setting during the 2016–
2017 
influenza season. This interim 
recommendation follows 3 influenza 
seasons during which observational 
data from the US Influenza Vaccine 
9
 by guest on June 2, 2019
www.aappublications.org/news
Downloaded from 
 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
Effectiveness Network revealed 
that LAIV performed poorly (see 
Table 2). The 2015–
2016 influenza 
season was the first season in which 
an updated influenza A (H1N1)
pdm09 LAIV virus strain was used 
in response to unexpectedly low 
vaccine effectiveness for LAIV 
against influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 
viruses in the 2013–
2014 influenza 
season. Despite this virus strain 
adjustment, LAIV was not effective 
against influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 
and influenza B viruses among 
children 2 through 17 years of 
age. Results of relative vaccine 
effectiveness favored IIV over LAIV 
for both influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 
viruses among children in this age 
range.
During the 2014–2015 influenza 
season, the predominant circulating 
influenza A (H3N2) viruses 
were antigenically distinct from 
the influenza A (H3N2) vaccine 
viruses, resulting in reduced 
vaccine effectiveness against 
influenza A (H3N2) viruses in all 
ages. In contrast to what had been 
anticipated from previous studies, 
LAIV did not offer greater protection 
than IIV against the drifted H3N2 
viruses. During the 2013–2014 
season, observational data from the 
US Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness 
Network and 2 additional studies 
showed that LAIV was not effective 
against the predominantly 
circulating influenza A (H1N1)
pdm09 viruses when compared 
with IIV in children 2 through 8 
years of age.
INFLUENZA VACCINES AND EGG 
ALLERGY
Although most IIV vaccines are 
produced in eggs and contain 
measurable amounts of egg protein, 
recent data have shown that IIV 
administered in a single, age-
appropriate dose is well tolerated 
by recipients with a history of egg 
allergy of any severity. Recent 
literature has shown that egg 
allergy does not impart an increased 
risk of anaphylactic reaction to 
vaccination with IIV. A 2012 review 
of published data found no instances 
of anaphylaxis among 4172 egg-
allergic patients, 513 of whom had 
a history of severe egg allergy, 
after vaccination with influenza 
vaccine; some did have milder 
reactions. According to a Vaccine 
Safety Datalink study, the rate of 
anaphylaxis after IIV3 administration 
is about 1 per 1 000 000 doses 
(10 cases in almost 7.5 million 
doses given alone from 2009 to 
2011). This rate is not different 
from those of other vaccines, 
including ones that do not contain 
egg. Although a waiting period of 
30 minutes after vaccination for 
patients with egg allergy was 
previously recommended, this 
study also found that the onset 
of symptoms of anaphylaxis after 
receiving any vaccine began more 
than 30 minutes later in 21 of 
29 cases. In addition, ccIIV4 is 
anticipated to be available for 
people 4 years and older during the 
2016–
2017 season.
The Joint Task Force on Practice 
Parameters, representing the 
American Academy of Allergy, 
Asthma, and Immunology and 
the American College of Allergy, 
Asthma, and Immunology, states 
that special precautions regarding 
medical setting and waiting periods 
after the administration of IIV to 
egg-allergic recipients beyond those 
recommended for any vaccine are 
no longer warranted. Therefore, 
the algorithm used beginning in 
the 2011–
2012 influenza season to 
guide vaccination precautions on the 
basis of the severity of the allergic 
reaction to eggs is not necessary. The 
recommended waiting period for 
influenza vaccine, as for any vaccine, 
is 15 minutes after vaccination for 
all vaccine recipients to decrease 
the risk of injury should they faint. 
Standard vaccination practice should 
include the ability to respond to acute 
hypersensitivity reactions.

VACCINE STORAGE AND 
ADMINISTRATION
The AAP Storage and Handling 
Tip Sheet provides resources for 
practices to develop comprehensive 
vaccine management protocols to 
keep the temperature for vaccine 
storage constant during a power 
failure or other disaster (https:// 
www. 
aap. 
org/ 
en- 
us/ 
Documents/ 
immunization_ 
disasterplanning. 
pdf). Any of the influenza vaccines 
can be administered at the same visit 
with all other recommended routine 
vaccines.
Intramuscular Vaccine
IIVs for intramuscular injection 
are shipped and stored at 2° to 
8°C (36°–
46°F); frozen vaccines 
should not be used. These vaccines 
are administered intramuscularly 
into the anterolateral thigh of 
infants and young children and 
into the deltoid muscle of older 
children and adults. The volume of 
vaccine is age dependent; infants 
and toddlers 6 months through 
35 months of age should receive a 
dose of 0.25 mL, and all persons 
3 years (36 months) and older 
should receive a dose of 0.5 mL. 
A 0.5-mL unit dose of any IIV should 
not be split into 2 separate 0.25-mL 
doses because of safety concerns 
for lack of sterility, variance with 
the package insert, and potential 
compliance difficulties with vaccine 
excise taxes.
Intradermal Vaccine
IIVs for intradermal injection are 
shipped and stored at 2° to 8°C 
(36°–
46°F). These vaccines are 
administered intradermally only to 
people 18 through 64 years of age, 
preferably over the deltoid muscle, 
and only using the device included 
in the vaccine package. Vaccine is 
supplied in a single-dose, prefilled

CURRENT RECOMMENDATIONS
Seasonal influenza vaccination 
with IIV is recommended for 
all children 6 months and 
older. LAIV should not be used. 
Children and adolescents with 
certain underlying medical 
conditions have an elevated risk 
of complications from influenza, 
which include the following:
 
• asthma or other chronic pulmonary 
diseases, including cystic fibrosis;
 
• hemodynamically significant 
cardiac disease;
 
• immunosuppressive disorders or 
therapy;
 
• HIV infection;
 
• sickle cell anemia and other 
hemoglobinopathies;
 
• diseases that necessitate long-term 
aspirin therapy, including juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis or Kawasaki 
disease;
 
• chronic renal dysfunction;
 
• chronic metabolic disease, 
including diabetes mellitus;
 
• any condition that can compromise 
respiratory function or handling 
of secretions or that can increase 
the risk of aspiration, such as 
neurodevelopmental disorders, 
spinal cord injuries, seizure 
disorders, or neuromuscular 
abnormalities; and
 
• pregnancy.
Additional vaccination efforts 
should be made for the following 
groups to prevent transmission of 
influenza to those at risk, unless 
contraindicated:
 
• Household contacts and out-of-
home care providers of children 
younger than 5 years and of at-risk 
children of all ages
 
• Any woman who is pregnant 
or considering pregnancy, is 
in the postpartum period, or is 
breastfeeding during the influenza 
season. Studies have shown that 
infants born to immunized women 
have better influenza-related 
health outcomes compared with 
infants of unimmunized women. 
However, according to Internet-
based panel surveys conducted 
by the CDC, only approximately 
50% of pregnant women reported 
receiving an influenza vaccine 
during the 2014–
2015 season, 
even though both pregnant women 
and their infants are at higher risk 
of complications. In addition, data 
from some studies suggest that 
influenza vaccination in pregnancy 
may decrease the risk of preterm 
birth and infants being small for 
gestational age. Breastfeeding also 
is recommended to protect against 
influenza viruses by activating 
innate antiviral mechanisms, 
specifically type 1 interferons. 
In addition, the breast milk of 
mothers vaccinated during the 
third trimester contains higher 
levels of influenza-specific 
immunoglobulin A. Greater 
exclusivity of breastfeeding in the 
first 6 months of life decreases 
the episodes of respiratory illness 
with fever in infants of vaccinated 
mothers. Pregnant women can 
receive influenza vaccine safely 
during any trimester.
 
• American Indian/Alaska Native 
children and adolescents
 
• HCP or health care volunteers. 
Despite the AAP recommendation 
for mandatory influenza 
immunization for all health 
care personnel, 
 
2 many remain 
unvaccinated. With an increasing 
number of organizations 
mandating influenza vaccine, 
coverage among HCP increased to 
77% in the 2014–
2015 season. The 
optimal prevention of influenza in 
the health care setting depends on 
the vaccination of at least 90% of 
HCP, which is consistent with the 
national Healthy People 2020 target 
for annual influenza vaccination 
among HCP. However, overall 
vaccination rates for this group 
remain consistently below this 
goal. The AAP recently reaffirmed 
its support for a mandatory 
influenza vaccination policy for 
all HCP nationwide. 
2 Mandating 
influenza vaccine for all HCP is 
ethical, just, and necessary to 
improve patient safety, especially 
because HCP frequently come into 
contact with patients at high risk 
of influenza illness in their clinical 
settings. For the prevention and 
control of influenza, all HCP must 
continue to put the health and 
safety of patients first.
 
• Close contacts of 
immunosuppressed people
CONTRAINDICATIONS AND 
PRECAUTIONS
Minor illnesses, with or without fever, 
are not contraindications to the use of 
influenza vaccines, particularly among 
children with mild upper respiratory 
infection symptoms or allergic 
rhinitis. Children with moderate to 
severe febrile illness, based on the 
judgment of the clinician, should not 
be vaccinated with IIV until resolution 
of the illness. Infants younger than 6 
months should also not be vaccinated 
with IIV. A previous severe allergic 
reaction (ie, anaphylaxis involving 
cardiovascular changes, respiratory 
or gastrointestinal tract symptoms, 
or reactions that necessitate the 
use of epinephrine) to influenza 
vaccine, regardless of the component 
suspected of being responsible 
for the reaction, continues to be a 
contraindication to future receipt of 
the vaccine.
The estimated risk of Guillain-Barré 
syndrome (GBS) is low, especially 
in children. As a precaution, people 
who are not at high risk of severe

 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
influenza and who are known to have 
experienced GBS within 6 weeks 
of influenza vaccination generally 
should not be vaccinated. However, 
the benefits of influenza vaccination 
might outweigh the risks for certain 
people who have a history of GBS and 
who also are at high risk of severe 
complications from influenza.
SURVEILLANCE
Information about influenza 
surveillance is available through 
the CDC Voice Information System 
(influenza update: 888-232-3228) 
or at www.

index. 
htm. 
Although current influenza season 
data on circulating strains do not 
necessarily predict which and in 
what proportion strains will circulate 
in the subsequent season, it is 
instructive to be aware of 2015–
2016 
influenza surveillance data and use 
them as a guide to empirical therapy 
until current seasonal data are 
available from the CDC. Information 
is posted weekly on the CDC Web 
site (www. 
cdc. 
gov/ 
flu/ 
weekly/ 
fluactivitysurv. 
htm). The AAP offers 
“What’s the Latest With the Flu” 
(http://www.aap.org/disasters/flu) 
messages to highlight those details 
most relevant for AAP members and 
child care providers on a monthly 
basis during influenza season.
VACCINE IMPLEMENTATION
These updated recommendations 
for the prevention and control of 
influenza in children may have 
considerable operational and 
fiscal effects on pediatric practice. 
Therefore, the AAP has developed 
implementation guidance on supply, 
payment, coding, and liability issues; 
these documents can be found at 
http:// 
redbook. 
solutions.

aspx.
In addition, the AAP’s Partnership for 
Policy Implementation has developed 
a series of definitions with the use 
of accepted health information 
technology standards to assist in 
the implementation of this guideline 
in computer systems and quality 
measurement efforts. This document 
is available at www2. 
aap. 
org/ 
informatics/ 
PPI. 
html.
The interim recommendation that 
LAIV should not be used in any setting 
during the 2016–
2017 season could 
have supply and financial effects 
on health care settings that have 
already preordered their influenza 
vaccines. The AAP is advocating with 
the manufacturer to appropriately 
address reimbursement for LAIV. 
In response to a decrease in overall 
influenza vaccine supply (ie, LAIV 
represented approximately 8% of an 
anticipated 171–
176 million doses), 
manufacturers may adjust their 
production capacities of IIV.
USE OF ANTIVIRAL MEDICATIONS
Oral oseltamivir remains the antiviral 
drug of choice for the management of 
influenza infections. Inhaled zanamivir 
is an equally acceptable alternative 
for patients who do not have chronic 
respiratory disease. However, it is 
more difficult to administer. Antiviral 
resistance to either drug can emerge, 
necessitating continuous population-
based assessment that is conducted 
by the CDC. If local or national 
influenza surveillance data indicate 
the emergence of an influenza strain 
with a known antiviral resistance 
profile, then empirical treatment can 
be directed toward that strain with 
an effective antiviral agent. During 
the 2015–
2016 season, the great 
majority of influenza strains were 
susceptible to oseltamivir, zanamivir, 
and peramivir. In contrast, high 
levels of resistance to amantadine 
and rimantadine exist, so these drugs 
should not be used in the upcoming 
season unless resistance patterns 
change significantly.
 
• Current treatment guidelines for 
antiviral medications ( 
Table 5) 
are unchanged for the 2016–
2017 
season and are applicable to 
both infants and children with 
suspected influenza when strains 
are known to be circulating in the 
community or when infants or 
children are tested and confirmed 
to have influenza. 
 
• Oseltamivir is available in 
capsule and oral suspension 
formulations. The commercially 
manufactured liquid formulation 
has a concentration of 6 mg/mL. 
If the commercially manufactured 
oral suspension is not available, 
the capsule may be opened and 
the contents mixed with simple 
syrup or Ora-Sweet SF (sugar-free) 
by retail pharmacies to a final 
concentration of 6 mg/mL ( 
Table 5).
 
• Continuous monitoring of the 
epidemiology, change in severity, 
and resistance patterns of influenza 
strains may lead to new guidance.
Regardless of influenza vaccination 
status and whether the onset of 
illness has been <48 hours, treatment 
should be offered as early as possible 
for the following individuals ( 
Table 6):
 
• any hospitalized child clinically 
presumed to have influenza disease 
or with severe, complicated, or 
progressive illness attributable to 
influenza; and
 
• influenza infection of any 
severity in children at high risk 
of complications of influenza 
infection ( 
Table 3).
Treatment should be considered for 
the following individuals ( 
Table 6):
 
• any otherwise healthy child clinically 
presumed to have influenza disease 
(the greatest effect on outcome will 
occur if treatment can be initiated 
within 48 hours of illness onset but 
still should be considered if later in 
the course of illness); and
 
• children clinically presumed to 
have influenza disease and whose 
siblings or household contacts 
either are younger than 6 months 
or who have underlying medical 
conditions that predispose them to 
complications of influenza.

Reviews of available studies by the 
CDC, the WHO, and independent 
investigators have consistently found 
that timely oseltamivir treatment 
can reduce the duration of fever 
and illness symptoms and the risks 
of complications, including those 
resulting in hospitalization and 
death. However, treatment efficacy 
has not yet been evaluated among 
hospitalized children or children with 
comorbid conditions in randomized 
trials. Although no prospective 
comparative data exist to date, 
multiple retrospective studies and 
meta-analyses have been conducted 
to determine the role of NAIs in 
treating severe influenza. Most 
experts support use of NAIs to reduce 
complications and hospitalizations, 
but less agreement exists on the 
use of NAIs in low-risk populations 
in whom the benefits are likely 
modest.
Importantly, treatment with 
oseltamivir for children with serious, 
complicated, or progressive disease 
presumptively or definitively 
caused by influenza, irrespective 
of influenza vaccination status 
or whether illness began greater 
than 48 hours before admission, 
continues to be recommended by the 
AAP, CDC, and Infectious Diseases 
Society of America. Earlier treatment 
provides better clinical responses. 
However, treatment after 48 hours 
of symptoms in adults and children 
with moderate to severe disease or 
with progressive disease has been 
shown to provide some benefit and 
should be strongly considered. In 
previous years, the use of double-
dose oseltamivir, particularly for 
those hospitalized with severe illness 
caused by influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, 
was believed to provide better 
outcomes compared with standard 
dosing. However, published data 
from a randomized prospective trial 
with 75% of subjects younger than 
15 years documented no benefit of 
double-dose therapy over standard-
dose therapy.

a Oseltamivir is administered orally without regard to meals, although administration with meals may improve gastrointestinal tolerability. Oseltamivir is available as Tamifl
 u in 30-mg, 
45-mg, and 75-mg capsules and as a powder for oral suspension that is reconstituted to provide a fi
 nal concentration of 6 mg/mL. For the 6-mg/mL suspension, a 30-mg dose is given with 
5 mL oral suspension, a 45-mg dose is given with 7.5 mL oral suspension, a 60-mg dose is given with 10 mL oral suspension, and a 75-mg dose is given with 12.5 mL oral suspension. If the 
commercially manufactured oral suspension is not available, a suspension can be compounded by retail pharmacies (fi
 nal concentration is also 6 mg/mL), based on instructions that are 
present in the package label. In patients with renal insuffi
 ciency, the dose should be adjusted on the basis of creatinine clearance. For the treatment of patients with creatinine clearance 
of 10–30 mL/min: 75 mg, once daily, for 5 d. For chemoprophylaxis of patients with creatinine clearance of 10–30 mL/min: 30 mg, once daily, for 10 d after exposure or 75 mg, once every 
other day, for 10 d after exposure (5 doses). See www.

b Approved by the FDA for children as young as 2 weeks of age. Given preliminary pharmacokinetic data and limited safety data, oseltamivir can be used to treat infl
 uenza in both term and 
preterm infants from birth because benefi
 ts of therapy are likely to outweigh possible risks of treatment.
c Oseltamivir dosing for preterm infants. The weight-based dosing recommendation for preterm infants is lower than for term infants. Preterm infants may have lower clearance of 
oseltamivir because of immature renal function, and doses recommended for full-term infants may lead to very high drug concentrations in this age group. Limited data from the 
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Collaborative Antiviral Study Group provides the basis for dosing preterm infants by using their postmenstrual age (gestational age + 
chronological age): 1.0 mg/kg per dose, orally, twice daily, for those <38 weeks’ postmenstrual age; 1.5 mg/kg per dose, orally, twice daily, for those 38 through 40 weeks’ postmenstrual 
age; 3.0 mg/kg per dose, orally, twice daily, for those >40 weeks’ postmenstrual age. For extremely preterm infants (<28 weeks), consult a pediatric infectious diseases physician.
d Zanamivir is administered by inhalation with the use of a proprietary “Diskhaler” device distributed together with the medication. Zanamivir is a dry powder, not an aerosol, and should 
not be administered using nebulizers, ventilators, or other devices typically used for administering medications in aerosolized solutions. Zanamivir is not recommended for people with 
chronic respiratory diseases, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which increase the risk of bronchospasm.

Children younger than 2 years are at 
an increased risk of hospitalization 
and complications attributable to 
influenza. The FDA has licensed 
oseltamivir for children as young as 
2 weeks of age. Given preliminary 
pharmacokinetic data and limited 
safety data, the AAP believes that 
oseltamivir can be used to treat 
influenza in both term and 
preterm infants from birth because 
benefits of therapy are likely to 
outweigh the possible risks of 
treatment.
In adverse event data collected 
systematically in prospective 
trials, vomiting was the only 
adverse effect seen more often 
with oseltamivir compared with 
placebo when studied in children 
aged 1 through 12 years (ie, 15% of 
treated vs 9% receiving placebo). 
In addition, after reports from 
Japan of oseltamivir-attributable 
neuropsychiatric adverse effects, 
a review of controlled clinical trial 
data and ongoing surveillance failed 
to establish a link between this drug 
and neurologic or psychiatric events.

Clinical judgment (on the basis 
of underlying conditions, disease 
severity, time since symptom onset, 
and local influenza activity) is 
an important factor in treatment 
decisions for pediatric patients 
who present with influenza-like 
illness. Antiviral treatment should 
be started as soon as possible after 
illness onset and should not be 
delayed while waiting for a definitive 
influenza test result, because early 
therapy provides the best outcomes. 
Influenza diagnostic tests vary by 
method, availability, processing 
time, sensitivity, and cost ( 
Table 7), 
all of which should be considered in 
making the best clinical judgment. 
Testing should be performed when 
timely results will be available to 
influence clinical management or 
infection control measures. Although 
decisions on treatment and infection 
control can be made on the basis of 
positive rapid antigen test results, 
negative results should not be used 
in a similar fashion because of the 
suboptimal sensitivity and potential 
for false-negative results. Positive 
results of rapid influenza tests are 
helpful, because they may reduce 
additional testing to identify the 
cause of the child’s influenza-like 
illness. Available FDA-approved 
rapid molecular assays are highly 
sensitive and specific diagnostic 
tests performed in less than 20 
minutes with the use of RNA 
detection. These molecular assays 
or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
test confirmation are preferred in 
hospitalized patients because they 
are more sensitive compared with 
antigen detection. Presumptive 
antiviral treatment in high-risk 
and hospitalized patients should 
be started before receiving rapid 
test, molecular assay, or PCR 
results. Immunofluorescence assays 
may be an alternative to PCR testing, 
although the sensitivity is lower. 
Early detection, prompt antiviral 
treatment, and infection-control 
interventions can lead to improved 
individual patient outcomes and 
allow for effective cohorting and 
disease containment.
Persons with suspected influenza 
who present with an uncomplicated 
febrile illness should be offered 
treatment with antiviral medications 
if they are at higher risk of influenza 
complications ( 
Table 3). Any 
otherwise healthy child who has a 
similar uncomplicated presentation 
should be considered for antiviral 
medication, particularly if he or she 
is in contact with other children 
who either are younger than 6 
months or who have underlying 
medical conditions that predispose 
them to complications of influenza. 
If there is a local shortage of 
antiviral medications, local public 
health authorities should provide 
additional guidance on testing 
and treatment. In past years, local 
shortages of oseltamivir suspension 
have occurred because of uneven 
drug distribution, although national 
shortages have not occurred since 
2009, particularly given 
the availability of the capsule 
formulation that can be made into 
a suspension for young children 
( 
Table 5).
Randomized placebo-controlled 
studies showed that oseltamivir and 
zanamivir were efficacious when 
administered as chemoprophylaxis 
to household contacts after a family 
member had laboratory-confirmed 
influenza. During the 2009 pandemic, 
the emergence of oseltamivir 
resistance was noted among people

receiving postexposure prophylaxis, 
highlighting the need to be aware of 
the possibility of emerging resistance 
in this population. Decisions on 
whether to administer antiviral 
chemoprophylaxis should take into 
account the exposed person’s risk of 
influenza complications, vaccination 
status, the type and duration of 
contact, recommendations from 
local or public health authorities, 
and clinical judgment. Optimally, 
postexposure chemoprophylaxis 
should only be used when antiviral 
agents can be started within 48 
hours of exposure; the lower dose 
for prophylaxis should not be used 
for the treatment of symptomatic 
children. Early, full-treatment doses 
provided to high-risk symptomatic 
patients without waiting for 
laboratory confirmation is an 
alternate strategy.
Although vaccination is the 
preferred approach to the prevention 
of infection, chemoprophylaxis 
during an influenza outbreak, as 
defined by the CDC (http:// 
www. 
cdc. 
gov/ 
ophss/ 
csels/ 
dsepd/ 
ss1978/ 
lesson1/ 
section11. 
html), 
is recommended in the following 
situations:
 
• for children at high risk of 
complications from influenza 
for whom influenza vaccine is 
contraindicated;
 
• for children at high risk during 
the 2 weeks after influenza 
vaccination, when optimal 
immunity is achieved;
 
• for family members or HCP who 
are unimmunized and are likely 
to have ongoing, close exposure 
to unimmunized children at high 
risk or unimmunized infants and 
toddlers who are younger than 
24 months;
 
• for control of influenza outbreaks 
for unimmunized staff and children 
in a closed institutional setting 
with children at high risk (eg, 
extended-care facilities);
 
• as a supplement to vaccination 
among children at high risk, 
including children who are 
immunocompromised and who 
may not respond with sufficient 
protective immune responses after 
vaccination;
 
• as postexposure prophylaxis 
for family members and close 
contacts of an infected person 
if those persons are at high risk 
of complications from influenza; 
and
 
• for children at high risk and 
their family members and 
close contacts, as well as HCP, 
when circulating strains of 
influenza virus in the community 
are not matched with seasonal 
influenza vaccine strains, on 
the basis of current data from 
the CDC and local health 
departments.
These recommendations apply 
to routine circumstances, but it 
should be noted that guidance may 
change on the basis of updated 
recommendations from the CDC in 
concert with antiviral availability, 
local resources, clinical judgment, 
recommendations from local or 
public health authorities, risk of 
influenza complications, type and 
duration of exposure contact, and 
change in epidemiology or severity 
of influenza. Chemoprophylaxis is 
not recommended for infants 
younger than 3 months unless the 
situation is judged critical because 
of limited efficacy data in this age 
group.
Chemoprophylaxis should not 
be considered a substitute for 
vaccination. Influenza vaccine 
should always be offered before and 
within the influenza season when not 
contraindicated, even after influenza 
virus has been circulating in the 
community. Antiviral medications 
currently licensed are important 
adjuncts to influenza vaccination 
for the control and prevention of 
influenza disease. Toxicities may 
be associated with antiviral agents; 
indiscriminate use might limit 
availability. Pediatricians should 
inform recipients of antiviral 
chemoprophylaxis that the risk 
of influenza is lowered but still 
remains while taking the medication, 
and susceptibility to influenza 
returns when the medication is 
discontinued. Oseltamivir use is not

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
For the 2016–
2017 season, 
postmarketing safety and real-time 
vaccine effectiveness data will be 
analyzed as they become available. 
Continued evaluation of the safety, 
immunogenicity, and effectiveness 
of influenza vaccine, especially for 
children younger than 2 years, is 
important. The potential role of 
previous influenza vaccination on 
overall vaccine effectiveness by 
vaccine formulation, virus strain, and 
subject age in preventing outpatient 
medical visits, hospitalizations, and 
deaths continues to be evaluated. 
Furthermore, complete analysis of 
quadrivalent vaccines is needed 
as the number of formulations of 
IIV4 increase. In addition, with 
limited data on the use of NAIs 
in hospitalized children or in 
children with comorbid conditions, 
prospective randomized clinical 
trials in this population are 
warranted. In addition, to administer 
antiviral therapy optimally in 
hospitalized patients with influenza 
who cannot tolerate oral or inhaled 
antiviral agents, FDA-approved 
intravenous NAIs for children also 
are needed. A single-dose, intranasal 
drug, lananimivir octanoate, needs 
further research as a potential 
option for influenza prophylaxis in 
children.
The interim recommendation that 
LAIV4 not be used in children will 
be reevaluated for future influenza 
seasons, although it is recognized 
that analyses of LAIV effectiveness in 
the United States during the 2016–
2017 influenza season will be limited. 
Data on the vaccine effectiveness of 
LAIV4 against a matched H3N2 virus 
strain are lacking. Analyses of LAIV 
effectiveness also differ somewhat 
between the CDC and other groups 
in the United States and abroad. This 
discrepancy may be attributable 
to varied sample sizes, dissimilar 
rates of vaccine exposure history in 
different populations, interference 
with the addition of the fourth 
vaccine antigen in the quadrivalent 
formulation, or other unknown 
factors. In addition, it recently 
has been documented that LAIV is 
well tolerated in children with a 
history of anaphylaxis after exposure 
to egg, similar to IIV. This finding 
could be clinically useful in the 
future.
Immunizing all HCP, a crucial step 
in efforts to reduce health care–
associated influenza infections, 
serves as an example to patients, 
highlighting the safety and 
effectiveness of annual vaccination. 
Ongoing efforts should include 
broader implementation and 
evaluation of mandatory vaccination 
programs in both inpatient and 
outpatient settings. Further 
investigation into the extent of 
offering immunization of parents 
and adult child care providers in 
the pediatric office setting; the 
level of family contact satisfaction 
with this practice; how practices 
handle the logistic, liability, legal, 
and financial barriers that limit or 
complicate this service; and most 
important, how this practice will 
affect disease rates in children and 
adults is needed. There is also a 
need for more systematic health 
services research on influenza 
vaccine uptake and refusal as well 
as the identification of methods to 
enhance uptake.
Efforts should be made to create 
adequate outreach and infrastructure 
to facilitate the optimal distribution 
of vaccine so that more people are 
immunized. Pediatricians also might 
consider becoming more involved in 
pandemic preparedness and disaster-
planning efforts. A bidirectional 
partner dialog between pediatricians 
and public health decision-makers 
assists efforts to address children’s 
issues during the initial state, 
regional, and local plan-development 
stages. Additional information can

With the increased demand for 
vaccination during each influenza 
season, the AAP and the CDC 
recommend vaccine administration 
at any visit to the medical home 
during influenza season when it is 
not contraindicated, at specially 
arranged vaccine-only sessions, 
and through cooperation with 
community sites, schools, and child 
care centers to provide influenza 
vaccine. If alternate venues, including 
pharmacies and other retail-based 
clinics, are used for vaccination, a 
system of patient record transfer 
is beneficial in maintaining the 
accuracy of immunization records. 
Immunization information systems 
should be used whenever available. 
Two-dimensional barcodes have 
been used to facilitate more efficient 
and accurate documentation of 
vaccine administration, with limited 
experience to date. Additional 
information concerning current 
vaccines shipped with two-
dimensional barcodes can be found 
at www. 
cdc.

vaccines/ 
programs/

2d- 
vaccine- 
barcodes/ 
. Access 
to care issues, lack of immunization 
records, and questions regarding 
who can provide consent may be 
addressed by linking children (eg, 
those in foster care or refugee, 
immigrant, or homeless children) 
with a medical home, by using 
all health care encounters as 
vaccination opportunities, and more 
consistently by using immunization 
registry data. Innovative strategies 
of capturing those who usually

prefer the intranasal formulation 
would be valuable given the recent 
recommendation to not use LAIV this 
season.
Development efforts continue for 
a universal influenza vaccine that 
induces broader protection and 
eliminates the need for annual 
vaccination. In addition, the 
development of a safe, immunogenic 
vaccine for infants younger than 6 
months is essential. Studies on the 
effectiveness and safety of influenza 
vaccines containing adjuvants 
that enhance immune responses 
to influenza vaccines are ongoing. 
Finally, efforts to improve the 
vaccine development process to 
allow for a shorter interval between 
the identification of vaccine strains 
and vaccine production continue. 
Pediatricians can remain informed 
during the influenza season by 
following the AAP Red Book Online 
Influenza Resource Page (www.
