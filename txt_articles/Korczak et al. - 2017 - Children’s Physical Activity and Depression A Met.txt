abstract
CONTEXT: Research regarding the protective effects of early physical activity on depression has 
yielded conflicting results.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to synthesize observational studies examining the association of 
physical activity in childhood and adolescence with depression.
DATA SOURCES: Studies (from 2005 to 2015) were identified by using a comprehensive search 
strategy.
STUDY SELECTION: The included studies measured physical activity in childhood or adolescence 
and examined its association with depression.
DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted by 2 independent coders. Estimates were examined by 
using random-effects meta-analysis.
RESULTS: Fifty independent samples (89 894 participants) were included, and the mean effect 
size was significant (r = –0.14; 95% confidence interval [CI] = –0.19 to –0.10). Moderator 
analyses revealed stronger effect sizes in studies with cross-sectional versus longitudinal 
designs (k = 36, r = –0.17; 95% CI = –0.23 to –0.10 vs k = 14, r = –0.07; 95% CI = –0.10 to 
–0.04); using depression self-report versus interview (k = 46, r = –0.15; 95% CI = –0.20 
to –0.10 vs k = 4, r = –0.05; 95% CI = –0.09 to –0.01); using validated versus nonvalidated 
physical activity measures (k = 29, r = –0.18; 95% CI = –0.26 to –0.09 vs k = 21, r = –0.08; 
95% CI = –0.11 to –0.05); and using measures of frequency and intensity of physical activity 
versus intensity alone (k = 27, r = –0.17; 95% CI = –0.25 to –0.09 vs k = 7, r = –0.05; 95% CI = 
–0.09 to –0.01).
LIMITATIONS: Limitations included a lack of standardized measures of physical activity; use of 
self-report of depression in majority of studies; and a small number of longitudinal studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity is associated with decreased concurrent depressive symptoms; 
the association with future depressive symptoms is weak.

Research interest in the health and 
psychological benefits of exercise 
has grown exponentially over 
recent years. Evidence suggests that 
physical activity may ameliorate 
depressive symptoms, supporting 
the use of exercise as part of a 
comprehensive treatment plan for 
major depressive disorder (MDD). 
1, 
 
2 
The reverse association has also 
been demonstrated: decreased 
physical activity (PA), as well as 
increased sedentary behaviors, 
confers vulnerability for developing 
depressive symptoms. 
3 
–5 To date, 
studies have investigated whether 
increased PA may also protect 
individuals against the development 
of MDD, and findings from 
observational studies are 
promising. 
3, 
 
6 
– 
8 However, the age 
range of participants in these 
studies has been wide, research 
has been conducted principally in 
adult populations, and results have 
been conflicting.9 
– 
11 Thus, using the 
current state of the literature for the 
purpose of clinical decision-making 
is challenging. A meta-analysis is 
warranted to resolve discrepancies 
in the literature and to examine the 
suggestion that the largest magnitude 
of protective effect may be found 
at younger ages, 
 
12 which would in 
turn provide support for a potential 
preventative role of physical activity 
in the development of depression.
Two recent systematic reviews 
13, 
 
14 
have reported that increased PA is 
associated with fewer depressive 
symptoms. However, only 1 review 
focused on the child and adolescent 
age group, 
 
13 and neither review 
conducted a meta-analytic synthesis 
of the data, which can provide a 
powerful estimate of the mean 
effect size across studies. Compared 
with adult participants, in which 
the investigation of risk factors is 
confounded by years of the allostatic 
load of depression (exposure to 
depressive symptoms and their 
associated physiologic strain) 
15 
and comorbid cardiometabolic 
disease, 
16 studies of children and 
adolescents enable the examination 
of the relationship between PA and 
depressive symptoms at their most 
nascent. To our knowledge, this is 
the first study to conduct a meta-
analytic review of the protective 
effect of PA on depression and, as 
such, is the first to describe the 
magnitude of this association. Also, 
previous systematic reviews have not 
explored the potential moderating 
role of sex in the association between 
PA and MDD, although a stronger 
effect for females has been suggested 
in several independent studies. 
4, 
 
17, 
 
18 
Understanding if the association 
between PA and MDD is sex-specific 
is relevant for the elucidation of 
potential underlying mechanisms of 
association.
The objective of this meta-analysis 
was to investigate the potential 
preventative effect of child and 
adolescent PA on depression. 
Several variables have been linked 
to differences in effects size; thus, 
we will examine whether between-
study differences were observed for 
child age, sex, and social risk. 
19 
– 
21 We 
will also examine if heterogeneity 
in effect sizes can be explained by 
variation in study methodology 
(eg, methods of assessing physical 
activity and depression), as well 
as study quality (eg, longitudinal 
versus cross-sectional). Clarification 
on the role of these factors for 
understanding systematic differences 
in effect sizes are important for 
the design and implementation of 
targeted and effective public health 
prevention programs.
METHODS
Search Strategy
Published studies on PA and 
depression in children and 
adolescents were identified by 
searching Social Sciences Abstracts, 
International Bibliography of the 
Social Sciences, Scopus, SportDiscus, 
CBA Abstracts, Physical Education 
Index, Sociological Abstracts, and 
PsycINFO electronic databases for 
potential articles through October 
2015. The search was limited to 
English language articles published 
between 2005 and 2015 using the 
keywords (“child*, 
” or “teen*, 
” or 
“adolesc*, 
” or “youth*, 
” or “infant, 
” 
or “infancy, 
” or “baby, 
” or “babies”) 
AND (“depress*”), AND (“sedentary 
behavio*” or “recreation” or “physical 
activity” or “leisure activity” or 
“exercise” or “fitness” or “sport*”). 
This search strategy yielded 3147 
nonduplicate articles.
Study Inclusion and Exclusion 
Criteria
Titles and abstracts of the articles 
were reviewed to identify studies 
that met the inclusion criteria. 
Articles selected for the current 
study were based on the following 
criteria. (1) Cross-sectional study 
of PA and depression collected 
during childhood or adolescence 
(<18 years). (2) Longitudinal study 
of PA collected during childhood or 
adolescence (<18 years); (3) The 
constructs measured were PA (eg, 
energy expenditure) and depressive 
symptoms. Studies that measured 
broader, nonspecific constructs 
of either PA (eg, participation 
in extracurricular activities) or 
of depression (eg, psychological 
distress) were excluded. Because 
numerous standardized, validated 
and accessible measures of 
depression among youth are widely 
available, studies that assessed the 
outcome of depression by using 
a nonvalidated measure were 
excluded. Only 1 study 
22 needed 
to be excluded because it assessed 
depression by using a single self-
report item with no demonstrated 
psychometric properties. In contrast 
to the depression literature, 
fewer standardized and validated 
measures exist for assessing physical 
activity. Thus, no validity criterion 
was applied to the measure of 
PA. However, a validated versus 
nonvalidated PA measure was

examined as a moderator to 
determine if this measurement 
characteristic explained between 
study heterogeneity. (4) The study 
statistic could be transformed into 
an effect size (eg, correlations, odds 
ratios, means/SDs, and/or P values). 
(5) The full-text article was available 
and written in English. Studies in 
which PA was used as an intervention 
were not included in the current 
study.
Multiple results often emerge 
from a single dataset. If the same 
participants were used across 
multiple publications, only 1 study 
was included in the meta-analysis 
to ensure independence of effect 
sizes. A protocol was developed so 
that each sample of participants was 
only represented once in the meta-
analysis. First, if a single dataset 
presented both cross-sectional and 
longitudinal analyses, we selected 
the study with longitudinal data 
because this study design was 
underrepresented in our analyses. 
Second, if multiple publications 
emerged from a single cross-sectional 
dataset, we selected the publication 
with the largest sample size and 
most comprehensive data extraction 
information.
Multiple samples or groups often 
exist within a particular study. For 
example, some studies present 
results separately for boys and girls 
within a sample. In such cases, effects 
sizes for both these nonoverlapping 
samples were calculated and entered 
into the meta-analysis separately.
Data Extraction
All articles that met inclusion 
criteria were coded by using a 
standard coding form to collect 
information on study and sample 
characteristics. Several moderator 
variables were collected to explain 
effect size variability across studies. 
Moderator variables were divided 
into categorical moderators (sex, 
social risk [ie, low income, minority, 
or involved in child protective 
services], PA type, PA validated 
measure, depression measure 
type, study design, and country) 
and continuous moderators (age 
at PA/depression, time between 
assessments, and publication 
year). Some studies reported data 
stratified by level of PA. In such 
cases, data for the group with 
the greatest PA were used in the 
analysis. This was done to remain 
consistent with our primary 
objective. Data extraction was 
performed by 2 independent coders 
(DK and MC). Discrepancies were 
resolved through discussion, and 
consensus scores were entered into 
the final dataset.
Data Analysis
Effect sizes were calculated and 
analyzed by using Comprehensive 
Meta-Analysis version 3.0 
software. 
23 Effect sizes were 
calculated directly from 
information provided in each 
study. When provided, adjusted 
effect sizes were included. All 
effect sizes were transformed 
into correlations for the purpose 
of reporting mean effect sizes. 
Pooled effect size estimates were 
based on random effects model. We 
assessed for overall heterogeneity 
of the mean effect size using the 
Q statistic and by calculating the 
I2 statistic. The Q statistic is a 
test of the null hypothesis that all 
studies share a common effect size, 
and the I2 statistic examines the 
proportion of the variation across 
studies that is due to heterogeneity 
rather than chance, expressed as 
a percentage. General guidelines 
for the interpretation of the I2 are 
as follows: 25%, 50%, and 75% 
indicate low, moderate, and high 
heterogeneity, respectively. 
24 
Categorical moderator analyses 
were conducted by using Q 
statistics, 
 
25, 
 
26 whereas the 
significance of each continuous 
moderator was assessed by using 
meta-regressions.27 Finally, we 
examined publication bias using 
funnel plots and Egger’
s test.
Study Quality
To assess the quality of studies, 
a 7-point quality assessment 
tool was created based on those 
implemented in previous meta-
analyses of observational 
studies. 
28, 
 
29 The tool evaluated 
the articles based on the following 
7 criteria: (1) having a defined 
sample, (2) having a representative 
sample, (3) rater blinding, (4) 
report of relevant MDD and PA 
data, (5) adequate sample size, 
(6) statistical adjustment for 
covariates, and (7) a validated PA 
measure. Articles were given a 
score of 0 (“No”) or 1 (“Yes”) for 
each of the abovementioned criteria 
and summed to give a total score 
out of 7.
RESULTS
Our electronic search of 7 databases 
yielded 3147 nonduplicate articles. 
On review of the titles and abstracts, 
87 articles met inclusion criteria and 
full articles were retrieved. A total 
of 40 studies with 50 independent 
samples (89 894 participants) met 
the inclusion criteria and were 
included in analyses.  
Figure 1 
presents a flowchart of the review 
process.
Study and Sample Characteristics
Study Characteristics
As detailed in  
Table 1, 14 studies 
were longitudinal and 36 studies 
were cross-sectional. Sample sizes 
ranged from 55 to 14 594. Child 
age at the time of the assessment 
of PA ranged from 8 to 19 years. 
With respect to PA measures, 15 
studies examined the frequency of 
activity only, 7 studies examined 
the intensity of the activity, and 27 
examined a combination of frequency 
and intensity. With respect to the

assessment of depression, 4 studies 
measured depressive symptoms 
by using interview methodology, 
whereas 46 studies used self-report 
questionnaires. The overall burden 
of depressive symptoms in studies 
that used a depression self-report 
measure was low (see  
Table 1). 
A clinical diagnosis of MDD was 
reported at follow-up for the 4 
longitudinal samples that measured 
depressive symptoms by using a 
standardized interview. An MDD 
diagnosis was made in 5% to 13% 
of participants across these studies 
at follow-up. 
6, 
 
30, 
31 Although several 
studies specifically noted the absence 
of antidepressant medication 
use among participants, the large 
majority of studies did not include 
information regarding the use of 
medications.
Study Quality
Validated measures of PA were used 
in 19 out of 36 (53%) cross-sectional 
studies and in 10 out of 14 (71%) 
longitudinal studies, as indicated in 
 
Table 1. The mean study quality score 
was 4.9 (SD = 0.9) out of 7. For cross-
sectional studies, the mean percentage 
of participants with complete data 
were 96.6% (range: 68%–100%). 
For longitudinal studies, the mean 
rate of attrition between time points 
was 13.8% (range: 0.04%–30%). 
Additional detail regarding individual 
study- and item-level quality 
assessment scoring is summarized in 
Supplemental Table 6.
Overall Measure of Effect Size
A significant mean effect size for 
the association between PA and 
depression was found: (r = –0.14; 
95% confidence interval [CI] = –0.19 
to –0.10) ( 
Fig 2), suggesting that 
children’
s PA is negatively associated 
with depressive symptoms. The 
funnel plot revealed asymmetry ( 
Fig 
3) and Egger’
s test suggested that the 
asymmetry was significant (P < .01). 
Using the trim and fill analysis, the 
adjusted pooled effect size estimate 
was r = 0.06 (95% CI = –0.11 to 
–0.01). Statistically significant 
heterogeneity between the studies 
was found (Q = 1767.95; P < .0001; 
I2 = 95.23) and potential moderator 
analyses were explored, including 
demographic, measurement, and 
study design factors. The results of 
all moderator analyses are presented 
in  
Tables 2 and 
 3, and significant 
moderators are discussed in detail 
below.
Effect sizes were stronger in 
samples using cross-sectional 
designs (k = 36, r = –0.17; 95% 
CI = –0.23 to –0.10) compared with 
those using longitudinal designs 
(k = 14, r = –0.07; 95% CI = –0.10 
to –0.04), in which a weak inverse 
relationship between physical 
activity and future depressive 
symptoms was found. Similarly, 
studies that used interview-based 
MDD measures demonstrated 
weaker effect sizes compared with 
those that used questionnaires (k = 
4, r = –0.05; 95% CI = –0.09 to –0.01 
vs k = 46, r = –0.15; 95% CI = –0.20 
to –0.10). Stronger effect sizes were 
also observed in samples with no 
known risks (k = 44; r = –0.15; 95% 
CI = –0.21 to –0.10) compared with 
samples with social risk (eg, low 
income) (k = 6; r = –0.05; 95%

were stronger in samples examining 
a combination of PA frequency and

CI = –0.25 to –0.09) compared with 
intensity alone (k = 7; r = –0.05; 
95% CI = –0.09 to –0.01). Finally, 
stronger effect sizes were found in 
studies that used validated (k = 29, 
r = –0.18; 95% CI = –0.26 to –0.09) 
versus nonvalidated PA measures 
(k = 21, r = –0.08; 95% CI = –0.11 to 
–0.05).
Longitudinal Studies
Because there were significant 
differences in effect sizes between 
cross-sectional and longitudinal 
studies, and because longitudinal 
associations may provide 
insight into the directionality of 
associations, we performed a set 
of subanalyses with longitudinal 
studies only to more explicitly 
examine the magnitude of the 
association, as well as the between-
study variability, for studies 
assessing a baseline metric of 
physical activity and its association 
with later depressive symptoms. 
There were 14 studies involving 
15 926 participants that reported 
on longitudinal associations 
between PA and depression. Five 
studies

8, 
 
30,

depression-related covariates, 
including baseline depressive 
symptoms, number of weeks 
depressed during the preceding 
year, body dissatisfaction, social 
support, self-efficacy, history of 
childhood trauma or stressful 
life events, and medication status 
( 
Table 1).
The mean effect size for the 
longitudinal association between PA 
and depression was r = –0.07 (95% 
CI = –0.10 to –0.04). Statistically 
significant heterogeneity between 
studies was found (Q = 59.25; 
P < .0001; I2 = 77.52) and potential 
moderator analyses were explored 
(

DISCUSSION
This systematic review and meta-
analysis of 50 samples involving 
89 894 participants found that a 
greater PA level was associated 
with fewer depressive symptoms, 
although not with decreased 
diagnoses of MDD. This association 
was stronger for cross-sectional 
studies than for longitudinal studies, 
in which the mean effect size was

Inserting an average effect size across all stratifi
 ed groups for studies that categorized PA into strata had no effect on the overall mean effect size (r = 
–0.14; 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.10).

significant, but weak. The nature of 
the PA was also associated with the 
presence of depressive symptoms, 
in that PA of increased frequency 
and intensity was more strongly 
associated with decreased depressive 
symptoms compared with PA that 
was defined by intensity of activity 
alone.
Significant effect sizes were 
observed for studies that examined 
depressive symptomatology by 
using questionnaire measures and 
were considerably stronger than 
those of studies assessing MDD by 
using interview measures. Indeed, 
the majority of studies in this meta-
analysis employed self-report 
inventories to assess depressive 
symptoms (n = 46) rather than 
diagnostic interviews (n = 4), 
which are considered to be the 
gold-standard measure for MDD. 
Self-report measures are frequently 
used in research studies due to their 
ease of administration, low cost, 
minimal time requirement, and low 
patient response burden. These 
measures are useful screening tools; 
however, self-report instruments 
are limited by their inability to 
confirm the presence or absence of 
an MDD diagnosis. That increased 
PA was more highly associated with 
decreased depressive symptoms 
in this meta-analysis, as compared

with an MDD diagnosis, is a critical 
finding. This finding suggests that 
individuals who are at risk for more 
severe, syndromal-level symptom 
burden, impairment, and associated 
poor health outcomes may not 
respond to the potential preventative 
effects of PA. Although it is possible 
that these results may also reflect the 
relative methodological limitations 
associated with the examination of 
a dichotomous versus a continuous 
variable, our findings are consistent 
with previous data reporting that 
MDD severity is distinguished from 
subsyndromal depressive symptoms 
by its decreased sensitivity to 
prevention strategies, greater 
association with cardiovascular risk 
factors and health outcomes, and 
greater treatment resistance.

Increased PA was more strongly 
associated with decreased depressive 
symptoms in cross-sectional studies 
compared with longitudinal studies, 
where the effect size was small. 
Cross-sectional studies are limited 
in their ability to probe causality, 
because the temporal relationship 
between variables cannot be 
determined. Thus, it is possible 
that the cross-sectional studies 
included in this meta-analysis are 
actually indicative of the reverse 
association of PA and depression: 
that children and adolescents with 
increased depressive symptoms 
are less likely to participate in PA. 
Indeed, amotivation, pessimism, 
and anhedonia associated with the 
depressed state have been reported 
to lead to decreased PA among 
adult populations. 
71 In contrast, 
longitudinal studies provide insight 
into the direction of the association 
and, in the present meta-analysis, 
demonstrated a weak inverse

relationship between PA and future 
depressive symptoms measured 2 to 
17 years later, suggesting that PA has 
a weak but positive association with 
future mood.
Studies that included a measure of 
both increased PA frequency and 
intensity demonstrated stronger 
associations with depressive 
symptoms than those that used 
measures of intensity alone. This 
finding is consistent with other 
systematic reviews examining the 
role of PA as an intervention for 
depressed adults. 
1 Currently, some 
clinical guidelines recommend 
the inclusion of 45 minutes of 
moderately intense exercise 
at least 3 days per week in the 
treatment of MDD among adults. 
72 
In contrast, guidelines for general 
health promotion by the Canadian 
Pediatric Society 
73 and American 
Academy of Pediatrics 
74 recommend 
that children and adolescents get 
at least 60 minutes of moderate 
to vigorous PA daily to maintain 
general health. As such, the findings 
from the current study support the 
inclusion of both the PA frequency 
and intensity components in the 
Canadian Pediatric Society and 
American Academy of Pediatrics 
recommendations with respect 
to the benefit to depressed mood. 
Many hypotheses regarding the 
mechanism by which PA may 
lead to improved mood have 
been theorized, including via 
antiinflammatory effects, increased 
growth factors leading to neural 
plasticity, neuroendocrine effects 
on the hypothalamic-pituitary-
adrenal axis and insulin sensitivity, 
and improvements in self-
efficacy.75 
– 
77 However, neither 
the pathophysiological pathways 
themselves nor whether they are 
specific to mood state are known. 
These factors are important for 
determining rational prevention 
versus treatment strategies, 
gaining insight into the etiology of 
depression, and for research into 
novel treatments for depression for 
medically ill populations and those 
unable to participate in PA.
Studies that examined the 
association of PA with depression 
in samples of higher social risk (eg, 
low income, minority, or involved in 
child protective services) reported 
weaker effect sizes than those of 
lower-risk groups. Socioeconomic 
status and its associated risk factors 
(eg, disadvantaged neighborhoods) 
explain a significant proportion 
of the variance in childhood 
psychopathology, including 
depression. 
78 Because children 
in high–social risk environments 
may be exposed to many more 
risk factors for depression, 
including lower socioeconomic 
status, 
 
79 increased PA may have 
relatively less influence with 
respect to the proportion of the 
variance in depression it explains 
when compared with children of 
lower social risk. 
80 Also, because 
measures of depression and PA 
have traditionally been developed 
in samples of low social risk, they 
may be less well calibrated to 
capture the variation in depression 
or PA seen in high–social risk 
children. 
81, 
82 These results should 
be interpreted with caution, 
however, because few studies 
have examined the association of 
PA with depression in high–social 
risk samples. Given the increased 
prevalence of both depression and 
obesity in populations of high social 
risk, however, additional research 
examining potential targets for 
prevention among this vulnerable 
group of children is needed.
As the first study to conduct a meta-
analytic review of the potential 
protective association of childhood 
PA with depression, this study 
has many strengths, including 
the analysis of a large number of 
studies to increase the precision of 
effect size estimates, subanalysis of 
cross-sectional versus longitudinal 
associations, and examination 
of PA frequency and intensity as 
potentially contributing effect 
modifiers. However, our findings 
must be interpreted within the 
context of the limitations of this 
study. The measurement of PA in 
the majority of studies relied on 
self-report measures of frequency, 
intensity, and type of activity, 
which were not correlated with 
objective measures of activity (eg, 
accelerometry). This also reflects 
a limitation of the PA literature 
more broadly, in that the use of 
standardized instruments that 
have demonstrated reliability and 
validity was not consistent across 
studies. The current meta-analysis 
demonstrated that studies with 
validated measures of PA had 
stronger effect sizes than those 
that used nonvalidated measures. 
Thus, future PA research should 
focus on the methodology for PA 
measurement in children and 
adolescents to increase confidence 
in the study results. In addition, 
the majority of the literature relies 
on the self-report of depressive 
symptoms, with few studies able to 
confirm a diagnosis of depression, 
leading to wide precision estimates 
of the magnitude of the effect of 
PA on clinical depression. Finally, 
we only included studies that were 
published in English, and this 
inclusion criterion may limit the 
generalizability of our findings to 
predominantly English-speaking 
countries.
CONCLUSIONS
This systematic review and meta-
analysis finds that increased PA 
in childhood and adolescence is 
associated with decreased depressive 
symptoms. Substantive moderators 
of this association include (1) study 
design, with the strongest association 
found in cross-sectional studies; 
(2) type of PA, with a combination 
of PA frequency and intensity 
resulting in the greatest effect on 
11

KORCZAK et al 
depressive symptoms; and (3) 
depression measure, with a stronger 
protective effect of increased PA 
for depressive symptoms than for 
a clinical diagnosis of MDD. Taken 
together, this study suggests that 
PA in childhood and adolescence is 
associated with improved concurrent 
symptoms of depression, particularly 
when undertaken regularly and with 
vigor, and has weak but significant 
effects on future depressive 
symptoms. Future research is 
needed to advance the knowledge 
of PA measurement, elucidate the 
mechanism of association between
