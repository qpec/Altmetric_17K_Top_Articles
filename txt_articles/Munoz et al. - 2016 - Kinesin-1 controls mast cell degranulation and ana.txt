Introduction
Mast cells (MCs) are granulated cells of hematopoietic lineage 
that house most tissues in the body. These cells are present in 
especially large numbers under epithelial and mucosal sur-
faces exposed to the external environment (such as the skin, 
the airways, and the intestine). Although MCs are key effec-
tors in innate immunity, they also play a harmful role in aller-
gies—the most serious manifestation of which is anaphylaxis 
(Galli et al., 2005a,b).
MCs express several receptors on their surface, includ-
ing the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) responsible for al-
lergic triggering (Beghdadi et al., 2011). Within minutes of the 
cross-linking of receptor-bound IgE by a specific, multivalent 
antigen or allergen, the MCs’ stored secretory granules (SGs) 
degranulate and release a variety of inflammatory mediators 
(including proteases, proteoglycans, lysosomal enzymes such 
as β-hexosaminidase, and biogenic amines such as histamine 
and serotonin). This is followed (within 15–30 min) by the 
synthesis of lipid mediators, such as leukotrienes and prosta-
glandins, and (after several hours) by the de novo synthesis and 
secretion of cytokines and chemokines that mediate the inflam-
matory response (Blank and Rivera, 2004; Blank et al., 2014; 
Wernersson and Pejler, 2014).
Degranulation is accompanied by the extensive reorgani-
zation of the cytoskeleton associated with membrane ruffling 
and spreading (Dráber and Dráber, 2015). The degranulation 
process also involves the anterograde movement of SGs toward 
Cross-linking of mast cell (MC) IgE receptors (FcεRI) triggers degranulation of secretory granules (SGs) and the re-
lease of many allergic and inflammatory mediators. Although degranulation depends crucially on microtubule dy-
namics, the molecular machinery that couples SGs to microtubule-dependent transport is poorly understood. In this 
study, we demonstrate that mice lacking Kif5b (the heavy chain of kinesin-1) in hematopoietic cells are less sensitive 
to IgE-mediated, passive, systemic anaphylaxis. After IgE-induced stimulation, bone marrow–derived MCs from Kif5b 
knockout mice exhibited a marked reduction in SG translocation toward the secretion site. In contrast, a lack of Kif5b 
did not affect cytokine secretion, early FcεRI-initiated signaling pathways, or microtubule reorganization upon FcεRI 
stimulation. We identified Slp3 as the critical effector linking kinesin-1 to Rab27b-associated SGs. Kinesin-1 recruit-
ment to the Slp3/Rab27b effector complex was independent of microtubule reorganization but occurred only upon 
stimulation requiring phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity. Our findings demonstrate that PI3K-dependent 
formation of a kinesin-1/Slp3/Rab27b complex is critical for the microtubule-dependent movement of SGs required 
for MC degranulation.

the plasma membrane, where they fuse to release their contents. 
It has been shown that the FcεRI-mediated anterograde move-
ment of SGs depends on microtubule dynamics (Nishida et al., 
2005). This involves the activation of a Fyn/Gab2/RhoA sig-
naling pathway but is independent of calcium influx (Nishida 
et al., 2005, 2011). Further studies have highlighted a role for 
ARF1 after activation by Fyn and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 
(PI3K; recruited via Gab2; Nishida et al., 2011). More recently, 
DOCK5, Nck2, and Akt (a downstream effector of PI3K) have 
been shown to regulate microtubule dynamics in MCs (Ogawa 
et al., 2014). This involved the Akt-mediated inactivation of 
glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK3β), which promotes micro-
tubule assembly. However, the molecular machinery that links 
the trafficking of SGs to microtubule dynamics in MCs has yet 
to be well characterized.
There are some data on the mechanism that controls the 
fusion between SGs and between SGs and the plasma mem-
brane in MCs. It includes SNA 
REs (such as syntaxin 3 [STX3], 
STX4, SNAP-23, and VAMP8) and the accessory molecule 
Munc18-2 (Tiwari et al., 2008; Lorentz et al., 2012; Brochetta 
et al., 2014). The small GTPases Rab27a and (especially) 
Rab27b are also involved in MC degranulation (Mizuno et al., 
2007). It has been shown that the GTP-bound forms of Rab27a 
and Rab27b recruit effectors of the synaptotagmin-like protein 
family (Slp1/JFC1, Slp2a, Slp3, Slp4/granuphilin, and Slp5), 
which are involved in the trafficking and docking of secretory 
vesicles in various cell types (Fukuda et al., 2002; Kuroda et 
al., 2002; Ménasché et al., 2008). Members of the Slp family 
share an N-terminal Rab27-binding Slp homology domain and 
a C-terminal phospholipid binding tandem C2 domain.
In cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and in neurons, we and 
others have reported that the plus end movement of cytotoxic 
granules and synaptic vesicles, respectively, is mediated by the 
microtubule-dependent motor protein kinesin-1 (Arimura et al., 
2009; Kurowska et al., 2012). A Rab27a/Slp3/kinesin-1 com-
plex was shown to regulate cytotoxic granule transport in CTLs, 
whereas a Rab27b/Slp1/CRMP-2/kinesin-1 molecular complex 
is involved in the anterograde transport of synaptic vesicles in 
neurons (Arimura et al., 2009; Kurowska et al., 2012). Kine-
sin-1 (the archetypal member of the kinesin superfamily) is 
a tetrameric protein composed of two heavy chains (KIF5A, 
KIF5B, or KIF5C) and two kinesin light chains (KLCs; KLC1, 
KLC2, KLC3, or KLC4; Hirokawa, 1998). KIF5B and KLC1 
are ubiquitously distributed and mediate the plus end–directed, 
microtubule-dependent transport of cargoes. The targeted inac-
tivation of Kif5b in pancreatic β cells revealed a key role for 
kinesin-1 in insulin secretion (Cui et al., 2011). The study of an-
other mouse model in which Kif5b had been specifically inacti-
vated in myogenic cells revealed that kinesin-1 has an important 
role in the anterograde transport of key elements required for 
myofibril assembly (including α-sarcomeric actin, myosin IIB, 
nestin, and desmin; Wang et al., 2013).
To characterize the function of kinesin-1 in MC degran-
ulation, we crossed the Kif5bfl/− mouse (Cui et al., 2011) with 
the VAV1-Cre mouse. The Kif5bfl/−;VAV1-CRE conditional 
knockout (cKOKif5b) offspring lack Kif5b in all their hematopoi-
etic lineages, including MCs. These mice display no obvious 
abnormal development of the lymphoid and myeloid lineages. 
Here, we demonstrate that kinesin-1 regulates FcεRI-mediated 
MC degranulation both in vitro and in vivo. We further identify 
the molecular complex and a signaling pathway downstream of 
PI3K that enable SGs to be recruited to kinesin-1.
Results
Kif5b is expressed in MCs and is not 
required for MC differentiation
To explore the molecular machinery involved in the anterograde 
transport of SGs during MC degranulation, we focused on Kif5b 
(the gene coding for the major heavy chain isoform of kine-
sin-1 expressed in murine MCs; Fig. 1 A). We generated the 
cKOKif5b mouse model, which lacks Kif5b in all hematopoietic 
cell lineages. In the absence of Kif5b, bone marrow progenitors 
differentiated normally into MCs in the presence of IL-3 and 
stem cell factor. Expression levels of the MC-specific markers 
FcεRI and c-Kit were similar when comparing wild-type (WT) 
and cKOKif5b bone marrow–derived MCs (BMMCs; Fig. 1 B). 
We confirmed that Kif5b was absent in cKOKif5b BMMCs, and 
we did not observe compensatory up-regulation of the other 
isoforms (Fig. 1 A). As kinesin-1 is a tetramer composed of 
two heavy chains and two light chains, we analyzed light chain 
expression in BMMCs. Quantitative real-time PCR assays of 
the three KLCs (KLC1, KLC2, and KLC3) showed that KLC1 
was the main isoform present in BMMCs (Fig. 1 C). We next 
confirmed the absence of Kif5b protein in cKOKif5b BMMCs 
(Fig. 1 D). In vivo, WT and cKOKif5b samples did not differ sig-
nificantly in terms of the MC counts in the skin of the back (in 
a toluidine blue staining; Fig. 1, E and F) or in the peritoneal 
cavity (detected using flow cytometry; Fig. 1 G). This finding 
indicates that kinesin-1 is not essential for MC survival or tissue 
targeting. Collectively, these results show that Kif5b deficiency 
does not affect MC development in vitro or in vivo.
Kinesin-1 regulates SG degranulation in 
MCs in vitro and in vivo
To determine the role of kinesin-1 in stimulus–secretion cou-
pling in MCs, WT and cKOKif5b BMMCs were sensitized with 
anti–DNP-IgE antibody before stimulation with DNP–human 
serum albumin (HSA). Time course experiments showed that 
within minutes, FcεRI-mediated BMMC activation induced de-
granulation (as measured by the release of β-hexosaminidase 
from SGs). Kif5b-deficient BMMCs exhibited a markedly im-
paired ability to degranulate upon FcεRI activation (Fig. 2 A). 
Likewise, when degranulation was assessed by measuring the 
exposure of CD63 at the cell surface upon IgE/Ag stimulation 
as described previously (Brochetta et al., 2014), we confirmed 
that Kif5b-deficient BMMCs expressed much lower levels than 
WT cells (Fig. 2 B). We also performed rescue experiments by 
reexpression of Kif5b in mutant BMMCs. As expected, rein-
troduction of Kif5b corrected the defective degranulation in 
Kif5b-deficient BMMCs (Fig. 2 C). Conversely, expression of 
a dominant-negative (DN) mutant of Kif5b (GFP-Kif5b DN; 
Kimura et al., 2005) lacking the kinesin ATPase motor domain 
of kinesis heavy chain in WT BMMCs inhibited IgE/Ag-stimu-
lated secretion (Fig. 2 D).
To assess kinesin-1’s role in MC degranulation in vivo, we 
performed passive systemic anaphylaxis experiments. 24 h after 
sensitization with anti-DNP IgE antibody, WT and cKOKif5b 
mice were challenged with DNP-HSA. The body temperature 
was recorded, and the serum level of MC-specific protease-1 
(MCPT-1) was assayed as an index of the severity of the ana-
phylactic response. As shown in Fig. 2 E, the body temperature 
drop was less pronounced in cKOKif5b mice than in WT mice 
(notably during the later phases). Likewise, cKOKif5b mice had 
lower serum levels of MCPT-1 at 60 min (relative to WT mice),

indicating that Kif5b-deficient MCs were impaired in their ca-
pacity to degranulate in vivo (Fig. 2 F).
To explore whether or not the absence of kinesin-1 in 
BMMCs affected SG translocation, we compared the distribu-
tion of SGs in resting cells and stimulated cells (at 10 and 30 
min) using an anti-STX3 antibody. In resting BMMCs, there 
was no difference in the SG distribution between WT and cK-
OKif5b samples (Fig. 2 G). In stimulated BMMCs, however, we 
observed a marked difference. 10 min after stimulation through 
FcεRI, at least 80% of STX3 was located at the cell periphery in 
WT BMMCs (indicating significant SG translocation and fusion 
with the plasma membrane), whereas only 15% of STX3 was 
found at the cell periphery in cKOKif5b BMMCs (Fig. 2 G). After 
30 min of activation, the proportion of cKOKif5b BMMCs in 
which SGs had reached the cell periphery had risen to 50%, but 
was still lower than in WT BMMCs (Fig. 2 G). These results in-
dicate that kinesin-1 is the molecular motor that enables SGs to 
translocate to the plasma membrane and secrete their contents.
To confirm and extend these findings, we used live cell 
imaging with total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) mi-
croscopy to analyze the time course of SG recruitment to the 
plasma membrane upon FcεRI activation. We found that after 
a brief period of endocytosis, WGA (previously used to label 
cytotoxic granules in CTLs; Sepulveda et al., 2015) constitutes 
a valuable marker of SGs in live BMMCs. The BMMCs were 
pulsed for 20 min with Alexa Fluor 488 (green)–conjugated 
WGA and then chased for 18 h (Fig. 3 A). WGA uptake was 
similar in WT and cKOKif5b BMMCs (Fig. 3 B). The WGA was 
present in the lumen of STX3-positive SGs (Fig. 3 C) and so 
probably labeled intraluminal vesicles (as previously shown for

cytotoxic granules; Sepulveda et al., 2015). Upon WGA load-
ing, BMMCs were sensitized with anti–DNP-IgE antibody and 
placed on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips. Immediately after 
the addition of DNP-HSA, TIRF microscopy images were ac-
quired for 15 min. In WT BMMCs, SG docking events were first 
viewed 8 min after stimulation and continued until the end of 
the acquisition (Video 1 and Fig. 3, D and E). In contrast, very 
few SG docking events were detectable in cKOKif5b BMMCs 
until 13 min after stimulation. However, the number of dock-
ing events in cKOKif5b BMMCs was much lower than in WT 
BMMCs (Video 2 and Fig. 3, D and E). These results indicate 
that kinesin-1 controls translocation of SGs to the secretion site.
Kinesin-1 is not essential for early 
signaling and cytokine secretion upon FcεRI 
stimulation
We next looked at whether functional kinesin-1 was required 
for early signaling pathways. WT and Kif5b-deficient BMMCs 
did not differ significantly in terms of Erk and Akt phosphor-
ylation (Fig. 4 A) or calcium influx (Fig. 4 B). These results 
indicate that the degranulation defect observed in the Kif5b- 
deficient BMMCs is not caused by impaired signaling down-
stream of FcεRI activation.
Because FcεRI receptor aggregation also leads to de novo 
synthesis and secretion of cytokines, we next sought to deter-
mine whether or not Kif5b-deficient BMMCs could produce 
and secrete proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-6, and 
CCL2 (also known as MCP1). After 3 h of stimulation through 
FcεRI, there were no apparent differences in cytokine secretion 
between WT and Kif5b-deficient BMMCs (Fig. 4 C). These re-
sults indicate that kinesin-1 is not essential for cytokine secre-
tion upon FcεRI activation.
Characterization of the kinesin-1–dependent 
transport machinery in MCs
Given that kinesin-1 has been shown to regulate the transport of 
Rab27/Slp-associated vesicles on microtubules, and that Rab27b 
is involved in MC degranulation (Mizuno et al., 2007; Arimura 
et al., 2009; Kurowska et al., 2012), we further explored the 
molecular machinery of kinesin-1–dependent SG transport in 
MCs. In line with literature data on defective secretion by MCs 
in Rab27b mice but not in Rab27a knockout mice (Mizuno et 
al., 2007), we found that Rab27b was the main Rab27 family 
member expressed in BMMCs, whereas Rab27a was only ex-
pressed at low levels (Fig. 5 A). When the expression of the five 
members of the Slp family was analyzed, only Slp3 was found 
to be highly expressed in BMMCs; Slp2 was expressed to a 
much lesser extent (Fig. 5 A). Because Slp2 protein could not 
be detected in BMMC lysate (Fig. 5 B), we investigated Slp3’s 
contribution to the kinesin-1–dependent transport machinery. 
Fig. 5 C shows that Slp3 coimmunoprecipitated with Rab27b 
in both unstimulated and FcεRI-stimulated cells. Interestingly, 
Kif5b coimmunoprecipitated with Rab27b strongly in stimu-
lated cells but not at all in unstimulated cells (Fig. 5 C).
To understand which proteins in the complex were able 
to interact with each other, we overexpressed different com-
binations of tagged proteins in HEK 293T cells. The strong 
interactions between Rab27b and Slp3 and between Slp3 and 
KLC1 were confirmed (Fig. 5, D and E). No interaction be-
tween Rab27b and the kinesin-1 light or heavy chains was ob-
served (Fig. 5, E and F). In contrast, Kif5b and Slp3 showed a 
weak interaction (Fig. 5 F), although it was not clear whether 
this occurred directly or required endogenous KLC1 expressed 
in HEK 293T cells. In contrast to the results in MCs (Fig. 5 C), 
activation of HEK 293T by PMA/ionomycin did not modulate 
the interaction between Slp3 and kinesin-1 (Fig. 5, E and F). 
These data suggest that the interaction between Slp3 and kine-
sin-1 does not require additional modifications. Because MC 
activation promotes Slp3/Kif5b complex formation, this deter-
mines kinesin-1’s ability to access Slp3 (Fig. 5 G).
We next investigated the subcellular localization of the 
kinesin-1–dependent transport machinery. To this end, we en-
gineered BMMCs to coexpress GFP-Rab27b and Dsred-Slp3. 
In WT BMMCs, strong overlap of the two fluorescence sig-
nals (Dsred-Slp3/GFP-Rab27b; 73.90 ± 2.54% overlap) was 
observed for the SGs labeled by STX3 (STX3/(GFP-Rab27b/
Dsred-Slp3); 73.22 ± 5.56% overlap; Fig. 6 A). Upon FcεRI 
activation, the Rab27b/Slp3 complexes (DRed-Slp3/GFP-
Rab27b; 80.92 ± 2.6% overlap) were recruited to the cell pe-
riphery and colocalized with STX3 (STX3/(GFP-Rab27b/
Dsred-Slp3); 70.9 ± 4.7% overlap; Fig. 6 B). In Kif5b-deficient 
BMMCs, translocation of the Rab27b/Slp3 complex to the cell 
periphery was dramatically impaired upon activation (Fig. 6, 
C–E), as had been observed for STX3 (Fig. 2 D). This finding 
further supports the critical role of kinesin-1 in the transport of 
Rab27b/Slp3-associated SGs to the cell periphery.
The endogenous Kif5b was mainly distributed along the 
microtubules, with strong labeling beneath the plasma mem-
brane and (to a lesser extent) in the cytosol and around the 
microtubule-organizing center (Fig. 6 F). The Kif5b-deficient 
MCs did not display any Kif5b labeling, confirming the anti-
body’s specificity (Fig. 6 G). Upon FcεRI activation, Kif5b in 
WT cells was predominantly recruited to the peripheral tubulin 
ring beneath the plasma membrane (an area of the cell that is 
rich in newly formed microtubules leading to filopodia-like ex-
tensions; Fig. 6 H). Microtubule organization did not seem to 
be affected by the absence of Kif5b in either unstimulated or 
stimulated cells (Fig. 6, G and I–K), and microtubules formed 
normally upon FcεRI activation (Fig. 6, J and K).
Because our results indicated that Slp3 links Rab27b- 
associated SGs to kinesin-1 upon FcεRI activation, we further 
analyzed Slp3’s involvement in SG secretion by using siRNAs to 
specifically knock down Slp3 in BMMCs. The high efficacy of 
Slp3 knockdown was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 7 A). 
The BMMCs’ ability to degranulate after Slp3 knockdown was 
assessed by measuring the membrane expression of CD63. 
Likewise, Slp3 silencing substantially impaired SG secretion 
(Fig. 7 B). We next looked at whether the secretion defect result-
ing from Slp3 silencing was also associated with a defect in SG 
translocation. In unstimulated Slp3-silenced BMMCs, STX3’s 
localization was essentially the same as in BMMCs expressing 
control siRNA (Fig. 7 C). In contrast, Slp3-silenced BMMCs 
were unable to translocate their STX3-containing SGs to the 
plasma membrane upon stimulation through FcεRI, whereas 
translocation did occur in BMMCs expressing control siRNA 
(Fig. 7 C). These data demonstrate that Slp3 is part of the mo-
lecular machinery that couples microtubule dynamics and SG 
translocation to the plasma membrane upon FcεRI activation.
The formation of kinesin-1–dependent 
transport machinery is regulated by PI3K
The results described previously suggested the existence of an 
active mechanism for recruitment of the kinesin-1–dependent 
transport machinery to SGs. To identify possible signaling path-

ways, we performed experiments with two specific inhibitors of 
PI3K and intracellular calcium flux (LY-294002 and BAP 
TA; 
Nishida et al., 2005, 2011). Both drugs severely impaired de-
granulation (Fig. 8 A). When assessing Kif5b recruitment to the 
granular Slp3/Rab27b effector complex upon FcεRI activation, 
we found that BAP 
TA had no effect; in contrast, treatment with

STX3 to the plasma membrane upon FcεRI activation. In agree-
ment with the uncoupling observed previously, LY-294002 dra-
matically impaired SG translocation to the plasma membrane, 
but BAP 
TA had no effect (Fig. 8 C; Nishida et al., 2005). As it 
had previously been shown that PI3K controls microtubule for-
mation (Nishida et al., 2005), we looked at whether recruitment 
of kinesin-1 to the transport machinery required microtubule 
formation. To this end, we disrupted microtubule formation 
using nocodazole. As expected, nocodazole strongly impaired 
SG secretion (Fig. 8 D) and the translocation of SG-associated 
STX3 to the plasma membrane (Fig. 8 E). Interestingly, treat-
ment with nocodazole had no effect on Kif5b/Slp3 complex for-
mation after stimulation via FcεRI (Fig. 8 F). Taken as a whole, 
these results indicate that the coupling between kinesin-1 and 
its granular effector complex is independent of the microtubule 
network but does require PI3K activity.
Discussion
MC activation by IgE and antigens triggers the release of SGs 
containing the preformed mediators responsible for anaphylac-
tic responses. Although microtubule dynamics are known to 
have a critical role in SG movement (Nishida et al., 2005, 2011; 
Ogawa et al., 2014), little is known about the molecular machin-
ery that couples SGs to the microtubule cytoskeleton and drives 
the granules toward the secretion site after MC activation. Here, 
we provide evidence that the Kif5b heavy chain isoform of ki-
nesin-1 is the key motor protein regulating the translocation of 
SGs to the plasma membrane upon FcεRI activation (and thus 
enabling anaphylactic degranulation) in vitro and in vivo. In 
contrast, Kif5b is not essential for the activation of proximal 
signaling pathways or the secretion of cytokines upon FcεRI 
stimulation. We further demonstrated that the kinesin-1 motor 
protein links microtubules to SGs through a newly character-
ized molecular machinery (composed of granule-associated 
Rab27b and the Slp3 adapter protein). We found that formation 
of this complex is highly regulated in MCs and requires stimu-
lation through a PI3K-dependent pathway.
Several lines of evidence suggest that Kif5b is critical for 
SG secretion upon FcεRI activation. A lack of Kif5b dramat-
ically impaired (a) the release of β-hexosaminidase enzyme 
stored in SGs, (b) the degranulation ability of BMMCs (as 
quantified by cell surface CD63 expression), (c) the subcellular 
translocation of granule-associated STX3 to the cell periphery, 
(d) the dynamic recruitment of SGs to the plasma membrane, 
and (e) the anaphylactic response in in vivo passive systemic 
anaphylaxis experiments. In contrast, calcium influx, proximal 
signaling pathways, microtubule reorganization, and cytokine 
secretion were independent of Kif5b function.
It is noteworthy that in the absence of Kif5b, the release 
of granule contents was only partially impaired in vitro and in 
vivo. This partial impairment may be caused by the particular 
type of secretion that occurs in MCs. Indeed, MCs use a degran-
ulation process called compound or multivesicular exocytosis, 
during which granules undergo fusion with each other before 
reaching the plasma membrane (Röhlich et al., 1971). These 
sequential fusion events may facilitate the release of the con-
tents of several SGs by limiting vesicle trafficking before fusion 
with the plasma membrane. Degranulation in MCs also occurs 
through SGs that have already docked at the plasma membrane 
and thus may not require active movement. Furthermore, we 
cannot rule out the possibility that kinesin family members 
other than kinesin-1 may regulate SG transport in MCs or par-
tially compensate for the loss of kinesin-1.
MC activation also leads to the synthesis and secretion 
of cytokines and chemokines. Our data show that the secretion 
of TNF, IL-6, and MCP1 was not affected in Kif5b-deficient 
Figure 4. Proximal signaling and cytokine secretion upon FcεRI activation is not affected in Kif5b-deficient BMMCs. (A) IgE-sensitized WT and cKOKif5b

BMMCs. When considered together with data on SNA 
RE pro-
teins, SNA 
RE accessory proteins, and actin regulatory proteins 
(such as VAMP8, Munc18-2, and Coronin1b; Tiwari et al., 
2008; Föger et al., 2011; Brochetta et al., 2014), our results em-
phasize that cytokine secretion and SG secretion in MCs use 
different vesicle trafficking pathways.
To more precisely characterize the SG transport machin-
ery, we focused on effectors of granule-localized Rab27b. This 
protein has previously been reported to affect MC degranulation 
and was also shown to link to proteins interacting with kinesins, 
notably through Slp adapters (Mizuno et al., 2007; Arimura et 
al., 2009; Kurowska et al., 2012). Among the various Slp mem-
bers endogenously expressed in MCs, Slp3 was the most highly 
expressed. Slp3 interacted with Rab27b, and both proteins co-
localized on SGs and were translocated to the plasma mem-
brane of MCs upon FcεRI-mediated stimulation. The critical

role of Slp3 in SG secretion was further demonstrated by the 
drastic impairment of SG secretion in Slp3-silenced cells, 
which resulted from a defect in SG translocation (closely mim-
icking the Kif5b deficiency). These data strongly suggest that 
Slp3 has a critical functional role in the translocation of SGs 
during MC degranulation.
Most interestingly, the Rab27b/Slp3 complexes in rest-
ing MCs localized to SGs labeled by STX3 but did not interact 
with kinesin-1. Furthermore, the recruitment of kinesin-1 to the 
Rab27b/Slp3 complex required MC activation. The molecular 
mechanism underlying kinesin-1’s interaction with the cargo 
receptor molecule Slp3 has not been described. Previous stud-
ies have revealed an autoinhibitory conformational mechanism 
used by a variety of kinesin motors, including kinesin-1 (Ver-
hey and Hammond, 2009). The motor protein adopts a folded 
conformation in which nonmotor domains come into contact 
with the motor domain, thus blocking binding to and movement 
on microtubules (Verhey and Hammond, 2009). The release of

autoinhibition involves cargo binding and cellular activation, 
which change the molecular motor’s phosphorylation status 
(Donelan et al., 2002; Verhey and Hammond, 2009). It has been 
reported that fasciculation and elongation protein-ζ1 and Jun 
N-terminal kinase–interacting protein 1 regulate kinesin-1 mi-
crotubule mobility by binding to inhibitory regions of kinesin-1 
(Blasius et al., 2007). Similarly, phosphorylation during cell di-
vision has been shown to remove the conformational autoinhi-
bition of members of the kinesin-5 and -7 families (Cahu et al., 
2008; Espeut et al., 2008). In pancreatic β cells, elevated intra-
cellular calcium levels induce the dephosphorylation of Kif5b 
by calcineurin, which thus promotes insulin secretion (Donelan 
et al., 2002). Overexpression of Slp3, KLC1, or Kif5b in HEK 
293T cells showed that Slp3 interacts with kinesin-1 through 
an activation-independent mechanism. One can reasonably hy-
pothesize that kinesin-1 adopts an autoinhibitory conformation 
in resting MCs, making it inaccessible for Slp3.
To identify possible signaling effectors for the formation 
of the kinesin-1–dependent transport complex machinery, we 
used specific inhibitor compounds to disrupt PI3K activation or 
calcium flux in response to MC activation through FcεRI. Our 
results show that Slp3/Kif5b complexes were not formed in the 
absence of PI3K activity. In contrast, complex formation was 
independent of intracellular calcium elevation. Our results are in 
agreement with a previous study showing that SG translocation 
to the plasma membrane is independent of calcium but depends 
on the dynamic reorganization of microtubules (Nishida et al., 
2005). However, calcium is required for the release of SGs and 
controls the fusion between the SGs and the plasma membrane. 
Previous studies have shown that PI3K (through recruitment to 
the Gab2 adapter protein) has an important role in the regulation 
of microtubule dynamics and SG translocation in IgE-stimulated 
MCs (Nishida et al., 2011; Ogawa et al., 2014). This process 
involved the regulation of microtubule dynamics via phosphor-
ylation and inactivation of GSK3β through Akt (a downstream 
effector of PI3K and ARF1; Ogawa et al., 2014). Interestingly, 
a previous study indicated that active GSK3 inhibited antero-
grade transport in neurons through the phosphorylation of KLC2 
(Morfini et al., 2002). However, further studies are now required 
to identify which of the signaling molecules downstream of

PI3K regulate kinesin-1’s accessibility to cargo receptors like 
Slp3. This may require investigation of kinesin-1’s phosphor-
ylation status under unstimulated and stimulated conditions to 
establish whether this posttranslational modification modulates 
kinesin-1’s access to its cargo receptor (as has been shown for 
kinesin-5 and -7 families; Cahu et al., 2008; Espeut et al., 2008).
Because Kif5b deficiency did not affect microtubule or-
ganization and microtubule formation upon FcεRI-mediated 
stimulation, we conclude that the impairment in SG transloca-
tion is solely due to defective mobility. Interestingly, disruption 
of the microtubule network by nocodazole did not abolish for-
mation of the kinesin-1–dependent transport machinery upon 
FcεRI-mediated stimulation, suggesting that the Kif5b/Slp3 
complex forms downstream of PI3K activity but is completely 
independent of concomitant microtubule reorganization.
In conclusion, we used a murine cKO model (lacking 
Kif5b in all hematopoietic lineages) to demonstrate that ki-
nesin-1 regulates SG transport upon FcεRI activation of MCs 
through the recruitment of Rab27b/Slp3 complexes. This 
process is regulated by PI3K after IgE-mediated stimulation. 
The fact that cKOKif5b mice exhibited very low levels of pas-
sive, systemic anaphylaxis suggests that kinesin-1 could be a 
valuable target for new therapeutic approaches for controlling 
IgE-mediated type I immediate hypersensitivity reactions (in-
dependent of chemokine/cytokine secretion).

Mice
VAV-Cre transgenic mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were first 
crossed with Kif5b+/− to generate Kif5b+/−;VAV-Cre mice. Next, Kif-
5b+/−;VAV-Cre mice were bred with Kif5bfl/fl mice to generate Kif5b-
fl/−;VAV-Cre (cKOKif5b) mutant mice and control (WT) Kif5bfl/+ 
littermates. Mice were genotyped by PCR using the primers described 
by Cui et al. (2011). Mice were maintained in pathogen-free conditions 
and handled according to national and institutional guidelines.
Cell culture and transfection
Bone marrow was isolated from femurs and tibias of 8–12-wk-old 
mice. Cells were then cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium 
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated FCS, 1% nones-
sential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 50 µM 2-ME, 100 U/ml 
penicillin, 100 U/ml streptomycin, 10 ng/ml IL-3, and 10 ng/ml stem 
cell factor (Miltenyi Biotec). After four weeks of culture, maturation of 
the BMMCs (c-Kit and FcεRI expression) was checked by flow cytom-
etry. BMMCs were transfected using the NEPA21 system (Nepagen), 
according to the manufacturer’s protocols.

amplified in triplicate on a real-time PCR cycler (ABI 7900) and an-
alyzed with Sequence Detection Systems software (version 2.2.2; Ap-
plied Biosystems). The relative mRNA levels were quantified using 
the comparative Cτ method and normalized against the mean values 
of ACTB as an endogenous control. Levels of KIF5A, KIF5B, and 
KIF5C transcripts were then expressed as a proportion of the mean 
value for KIF5B. Levels of RAB27A, RAB27B, SYTL1, SYTL2, SYTL3,

Degranulation assays
Release of SG contents was determined in a β-hexosaminidase assay. 
In brief, BMMCs were sensitized overnight with an anti-DNP–specific 
IgE. IgE-sensitized BMMCs were stimulated with 20 ng/ml DNP-HSA 
for the indicated time at 37°C. Cells were centrifuged at 4°C, and su-
pernatants were incubated in citrate buffer with p-nitrophenyl–N-ace-
tyl–β-d-glucosaminide for 60 min at 37°C. The reaction was quenched 
in carbonate buffer for 15 min, and the OD was determined at 405 nm. 
Specific release was calculated as the percentage of total β-hexosamini-
dase content in a Triton X-100 cell lysate, after subtraction of baseline 
degranulation in nontriggered cells. Degranulation of BMMCs was also 
evaluated by surface expression CD63 using flow cytometry. IgE-sen-
sitized BMMCs were either not stimulated or were stimulated with 20 
ng/ml DNP-HSA for 10 min. Cells were fixed in 3.7% PFA, incubated 
with anti-CD63 antibody (MLB International) at 4°C, and then incu-
bated with Alexa Fluor 647–conjugated anti–rat IgG (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) before flow cytometry analysis with a Fortessa system (BD).
ELI 
SAs of IL-6, TNF
, and MCP-1
BMMCs were sensitized with DNP-specific IgE overnight, washed, 
and then incubated for 3 h in culture medium containing 20 ng/ml 
DNP-HSA. Commercial ELI 
SA kits for IL-6, TNF, and MCP-1 (eBio-
science) were used according to the manufacturer’s protocols.
Immunofluorescence
BMMCs were sensitized with DNP-specific IgE overnight, plated onto 
fibronectin-coated glass coverslips (10 µg/ml, Sigma Aldrich) for 45 
min at 37°C with 1 mM MnCl2, and then activated with 20 ng/ml DNP-
HSA for the indicated times. BMMCs were fixed by incubation for 
15 min on ice in 3.7% wt/vol PFA and then for a further 10 min in 
NH4Cl (50 mM in PBS). The cells were then incubated for 1 h with spe-
cific primary antibodies in permeabilization buffer (PBS with 1 mg/ml 
bovine serum albumin and 0.05% wt/vol saponin; Sigma-Aldrich), 
washed twice, and incubated for another hour with fluorescent-conju-
gated secondary antibody in permeabilization buffer. Lastly, the cells 
were mounted on slides in Prolong gold antifade reagent in the pres-
ence or absence of DAPI (Invitrogen). Confocal microscopy was per-
formed with an LSM 700 system (ZEI 
SS) and 63× NA 1.4 objective. 
The images were processed with the LSM Image Browser (ZEI 
SS) and 
ImageJ software (version 1.43; National Institutes of Health).

BMMCs were stained for STX3 to assess the translocation of the SG 
upon activation. Two profiles were quantified: absence of transloca-
tion, and translocation to the cell periphery (defined by more than two 
thirds of the cell periphery where positive for STX3 labeling). BMMCs 
were stained for tubulin to assess the microtubule reorganization upon 
activation. Two profiles were quantified: absence of microtubule reor-
ganization (tubulin shapes adopt a peripheral ring), and microtubule 
reorganization (observation of at least two filopodia-like extensions per 
cell were considered to be microtubule reorganization).
TIRF
The TIRF assay was performed using WGA-488–loaded BMMCs sen-
sitized with DNP-specific IgE overnight. Cells were allowed to attach 
to fibronectin-coated glass coverslips (10 µg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) before 
stimulation with 20 ng/ml DNP-HSA. TIRF images were then acquired 
for 15 min (exposure time of 200 ms). During the observation, the cells 
were cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Fluorescence data were 
acquired with a TIRF imaging system (Eclipse Ti-E; Nikon). Images 
were acquired with a QuantEM 512 SC camera (Roper Technologies) 
and NIS-Elements AR software (version 3.1; Nikon). Image sets were 
processed with ImageJ software. 
A WGA-containing granule was defined 
by a minimum of a square of 3 × 3 pixels (1 pixel = 0.16 µm) of strong 
intensity signal, orange to white intensity from the pseudocolor scale.
Calcium flux
5 × 106 IgE-sensitized BMMCs were loaded with 5 µg indo-1 (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific) in RPMI medium supplemented with 10 mM Hepes, 
pH 7.0, for 30 min at 37°C. RPMI medium supplemented with 10 mM 
Hepes, pH 7.0, and 5% FCS was then added for 30 min at 37°C. Cells 
were washed and resuspended in RPMI medium supplemented with 5% 
FCS before the addition of 20 ng/ml DNP-HSA (to induce calcium flux). 
Calcium flux was measured by using a FAC 
SAria flow cytometer (BD) 
to monitor the fluorescent emission ratio (405 nm/475 nm). Time course 
analyses were performed using the FlowJo software package (Tree Star).
Passive systemic anaphylaxis
A temperature probe (Bio Medic Data Systems) was implanted into the 
subcutaneous tissue on the back of 8-wk-old WT and cKO mice. On 
the next day, mice were passively sensitized i.v. using 1 µg/g anti-DNP 
mouse IgE antibody (H1-ε-26). 24 h later, mice were challenged by the 
i.v. administration of 500 µg DNP-HSA (Sigma-Aldrich). The body 
temperature was recorded every 5 min for 60 min using a wireless 
reader (DAS-7007S; Bio Medic Data Systems). At the end of the re-
cording, blood samples were collected and the serum concentration of 
MCPT-1 was measured with an ELI 
SA kit (eBioscience).
Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation
For proximal signaling, 107 IgE-sensitized WT or cKOKif5b BMMCs 
stimulated with 20 ng/ml DNP-HSA for the indicated times were 
lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM 
EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100) supplemented with an EDTA-free pro-
tease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche). For the immunoprecipitation 
assay, 40 × 106 IgE-sensitized WT BMMCs were either not stimulated 
or were stimulated with 20 ng/ml DNP-HSA for 10 min. Cells were 
lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM 
MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol) supplemented with one 
EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablet and phosphatase inhibitors 
(Sigma-Aldrich). Immunoprecipitation was performed with polyclonal 
rabbit Rab27 antibody (Synaptic Systems). Anti-Slp3, anti-Rab27, and 
anti-Kif5b antibodies were used to develop the Western blots.
siRNA
Specific duplex siRNA targeting Slp3 was purchased from QIA 
GEN 
(references: n°1 = SI02899750, and n°2 = SI02899743).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with Prism software (version 6; 
GraphPad Software) using a two-tailed, unpaired t test.
