Cocaine addiction is characterized by dysfunction in reward-related brain circuits, leading to
maladaptive motivation to seek and take the drug. There are currently no clinically available
pharmacotherapies to treat cocaine addiction. Through a broad screen of innate immune
mediators, we identify granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) as a potent mediator of
cocaine-induced adaptations. Here we report that G-CSF potentiates cocaine-induced
increases in neural activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and prefrontal cortex. In addi-
tion, G-CSF injections potentiate cocaine place preference and enhance motivation to self-
administer cocaine, while not affecting responses to natural rewards. Infusion of G-CSF
neutralizing antibody into NAc blocks the ability of G-CSF to modulate cocaine’s behavioral
effects, providing a direct link between central G-CSF action in NAc and cocaine reward.
These results demonstrate that manipulating G-CSF is sufficient to alter the motivation for
cocaine, but not natural rewards, providing a pharmacotherapeutic avenue to manipulate
addictive behaviors without abuse potential.

rug addiction is a debilitating psychiatric condition
characterized by dysregulated drug intake, enhanced
motivation to both seek and take drugs, persistent use
despite negative consequences, and recurring cycles of abstinence
and relapse. Treatment of addiction to psychostimulants such as
cocaine has proven particularly difficult despite extensive work
characterizing the dopaminergic1, glutamatergic2, and neuronal
signaling cascades3 underlying the neurobiology of cocaine use.
Even with our advances in knowledge, targeting these systems
clinically in cocaine use disorder has proven to be difficult for a
number of reasons, including problems with side effects, routes of
delivery, or abuse potential of agents tested4. Thus, currently
there are no FDA-approved pharmacotherapies for treatment of
psychostimulant use disorders.
Studies of patients with cocaine use disorders have shown
dysregulation of multiple peripheral cytokines—some of which
correlate with extent of drug use5, and addicts show altered
immune system reactivity in response to drug cues6. While
cocaine and other abused drugs are known to have effects on
immune system functioning, only recently have studies begun to
examine the mechanistic link between altered immune function
and pathological substance use behaviors7–10. Here we aimed to
define the complex interaction between cocaine use and cytokine
signaling and how these factors alter reward, motivation, and
economic decision making to drive cocaine addiction.
To this end, we characterize the regulation of innate immune
system effector proteins in mice treated with cocaine. Via a broad
multiplex screen of serum immune factors, we define several that
are altered with cocaine exposure. However, while multiple
immune factors are regulated by cocaine, only one—granulocyte-
colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)—demonstrates upregulation
in multiple treatment paradigms as well as correlation with an
addictive phenotype. G-CSF has previously been shown to
play a neuroprotective role in stroke11,12, to delay degeneration in
models
of
neurodegenerative
disease12,13,
and
to
be
important for learning and memory processes14. Here, we
demonstrate
that
G-CSF
is
upregulated
in
the
nucleus
accumbens (NAc), a key brain reward region, by both cocaine
and by the activation of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to NAc
projections, and is a potent regulator of both neuronal and
behavioral response to cocaine. Together, these findings suggest
that manipulation of G-CSF function may represent a new target
for possible pharmacotherapies for patients with substance use
disorders.
Results
Identification of immune targets altered by cocaine. To identify
potential soluble factors in blood associated with cocaine
use, serum from mice treated with 10 daily doses of cocaine
(Fig. 1a, b—20 mg kg−1 i.p.) or 10 days of self-administration
(Fig. 1c, d—0.5 mg kg−1 for each infusion) was processed 24 h
after the final dose for multiplex analysis of 32 cytokines,
chemokines and growth factors. The values for each analyte,
represented as the fold-change from the respective saline group,
are shown as a heatmap in Fig. 1e (Experimenter admin:
n = 11 saline, 15 cocaine; Self-admin: n = 6 saline, 10 cocaine;
*p < 0.05; **p < 0.01). Raw pg/ml values for each analyte and
exact p values are available in Supplementary Data 1. To identify
potential targets for further study, several factors were considered.
First, if the effects were due directly to cocaine exposure, we
expected the analyte to be significantly altered in the same
direction in both experimenter and self-administered cocaine
paradigms. Second, if it was related to behavioral response to
cocaine, we expected the analyte to be correlated with cocaine
sensitization and/or intake during the self-administration period.
Several analytes were significantly affected by cocaine exposure,
but
only
two–G-CSF
(Experimenter-Admin:
two-tailed
Student’s t-test; t(24) = 2.48, p = 0.020; Self-Admin: t(9.4) = 2.51,
p = 0.032)
&
interleukin-1α
(IL-1α;
Experimenter-Admin:
t(13.6) = 2.19, p = 0.047; Self-Admin: t(13) = 7.29, p < 0.0001)—
showed a statistically significant change in the same direction in
both paradigms (Fig. 1e). Interestingly, while some analytes that
were significantly regulated in only one paradigm showed a trend
in the same direction in the other paradigm (e.g., KC, MIP-2),
there were several that showed a relatively strong regulation in
one cocaine administration paradigm, but no change at all in the
other (for statistics and values, please see Supplementary Data 1).
The biological significance of these discrepancies is not clear from
these experiments, but our findings highlight important differ-
ences between the two administration paradigms.
As a marker of which differentially expressed analytes might be
playing a role in behavioral responses to cocaine, we performed a
correlation analysis between the serum level of each analyte with
level of sensitization (in the i.p. injection paradigm), and the
amount of average daily cocaine intake (in the self-administration
paradigm). A heatmap of Pearson’s r values for all analytes is
presented in Fig. 1f (full correlation matrices with exact r and
p values are available in Supplementary Data 2. Interestingly, only
serum levels of G-CSF were increased by both experimenter-
delivery (two-tailed Student’s t-test t(24) = 2.48, p = 0.020) and
cocaine self-administration paradigms (Fig. 1g; t(9.40) = 2.51, p =
0.032) and showed positive linear correlation with extent of both
sensitization (Fig. 1h; Pearson’s r = 0.771, p = 0.025) and self-
administration (Fig. 1i; r = 0.768, p = 0.026). While G-CSF
showed both regulation and correlation in both paradigms, this
was not true for all regulated cytokines. Monokine-induced by
gamma interferon (MIG, also known as CXCL9) was upregulated
only after cocaine self-administration (Fig. 1j; t(10.3) = 3.74,
p = 0.0036), and showed positive correlation with levels of self-
administration (Fig. 1l; r = 0.766, p = 0.027). However, levels of
MIG were completely unaffected by experimenter-administered
cocaine (Fig. 1j; t(24) = 0.177, p = 0.86) and unrelated to cocaine-
induced sensitization (Fig. 1k; r = −0.361, p = 0.38). Similarly,
levels of IL-1α were significantly downregulated in both cocaine
administration paradigms (Fig. 1m—exper-admin: t(13.6) = 2.19,
p = 0.047; self-admin.: t(13) = 7.29, p < 0.0001), but showed no
correlation with either behavior (Fig. 1n, o). Based on this
evidence for the unique regulation of G-CSF by cocaine, it was
chosen as the subject of more in depth functional analyses.
Identifying the effects of G-CSF on neuronal activation.
Because we found that serum G-CSF levels were highly correlated
with the extent of cocaine experience, we aimed to define where
in the brain it might influence cocaine responses. Despite being a
~20 kDa protein, G-CSF is a soluble factor that readily crosses the
blood brain barrier15,16. To identify G-CSF-responsive brain
regions, we assessed transcript levels of the immediate early gene
c-Fos, which is used as a marker of neuronal activation17, after an
acute i.p. injection of cocaine across several regions implicated in
the motivation to self-administer cocaine: medial prefrontal
cortex (mPFC), nucleus accumbens (NAc), dorsal striatum,
ventral hippocampus, and basolateral amygdala (Fig. 2a). In the
medial prefrontal cortex we saw the expected main effect of
cocaine (Fig. 2b; two-way ANOVA F(1,27) = 16.41, p = 0.0004), a
main effect of G-CSF (F(1,27) = 5.243, p = 0.030), and a trend
towards
a
cocaine
by
G-CSF
interaction
(F(1,27) = 3.759,
p = 0.063). Post-hoc analysis revealed significantly enhanced
c-Fos induction when comparing cocaine alone to cocaine +
G-CSF (Holm–Sidak post-hoc: p = 0.026), but no effect when
comparing saline to saline + G-CSF (p = 0.80). We saw a similar

 pattern in the nucleus accumbens with a main effect of cocaine
(Fig. 2c; F(1,29) = 33.62, p < 0.0001), as well as a statistically sig-
nificant main effect of G-CSF (F(1,29) = 6.803, p = 0.014) which
was driven by a G-CSF by cocaine interaction (F(1,29) = 5.215,
p = 0.030). As with the medial prefrontal cortex, in the nucleus
accumbens of mice pre-treated with G-CSF there was significantly
enhanced potentiation of c-Fos expression after cocaine compared
to cocaine alone (p = 0.0059). This pattern was not seen in the
other brain regions analyzed: there was a significant main effect of
cocaine increasing c-Fos levels in the dorsal striatum (Fig. 2d;
F(1,28) = 20.76, p < 0.0001) and the ventral hippocampus (Fig. 2e;
F(1,24) = 11.46, p = 0.0024), but there were no main effects of G-
CSF or any significant interactions, and in the basolateral
amygdala we found no significant main effects or interactions
(Fig. 2f).
There are extensive projections from the mPFC to the NAc—
the only two regions that showed a significant interaction
between G-CSF and cocaine—and further, the levels of c-Fos
expression between these two regions was found to be correlated
(Fig. 2g; Pearson’s r = 0.904, p < 0.0001), suggesting the possibi-
lity that mPFC to NAc projections, already strongly implicated in
behavioral effects of cocaine18, may be playing a critical role in
this process, possibly via glutamatergic projections driving further
activation in the NAc.
Regulation of G-CSF gene expression in the NAc and mPFC.
Given that G-CSF treatment controls patterns of neuronal acti-
vation in the NAc and mPFC in response to cocaine, we exam-
ined how treatment with cocaine might affect the expression of

 G-CSF and its receptor locally within these regions. Transcript for
G-CSF itself (Csf3) was significantly induced in both regions 90
min after an acute (20 mg kg−1) i.p. injection of cocaine (Fig. 3a;
two-tailed Student’s t-test—NAc: t(17) = 2.60, *p = 0.019; mPFC:
t(8) = 3.06, p = 0.016). In contrast, when animals were analyzed
24 h after a seven-day course of cocaine (20 mg kg−1 per day, i.p.),
levels of Csf3 had increased even further in the NAc (Fig. 3b;
NAc: t(42) = 3.57, p = 0.0009), but were not significantly changed
in the mPFC (Fig. 3b; t(27) = 1.15, p = 0.26). Similarly, after this
prolonged
treatment
with
cocaine
we
found
that
levels
of the G-CSF receptor were also increased in the NAc (Fig. 3c;
t(24.1) = 2.71,
p = 0.012)
but
not
in
the
mPFC
(Fig.
3c;
t(20) = 0.853, p = 0.40). It is unclear as to why there were not
changes in the mPFC, however, it is possible that changes in
signaling from the receptor, not just relative expression levels
could be playing a role. These findings, in conjunction with the
c-Fos data, suggest strongly that the NAc is a crucial region for
G-CSF signaling in response to cocaine.
Previous studies have shown that G-CSF and its receptor are
expressed in forebrain neurons16,19 and multiple subtypes of glial
cells20,21, however, the expression pattern in the NAc remains
unknown. The primary output neurons in the NAc are composed
of two primarily non-overlapping populations of GABAergic
medium spiny neurons (MSNs), defined by the predominant
expression of D1 or D2 dopamine receptors. Thus, we performed
immunohistochemistry to examine both expression levels of
G-CSF and its receptor in these two subpopulations using mice
that express tdTomato under the control of the D1 receptor
promoter, and thereby identifying both D1+ and D1− popula-
tions. G-CSFR was highly expressed in both D1+ and D1− cell
populations (Fig. 4a upper), suggesting expression in both cell
types. In addition to expression in cells that morphologically
resemble MSNs, expression was detected in surrounding glial
cells.
Similarly, G-CSF itself seems to be expressed in a diverse array
of cell types (Fig. 4a lower), and while there is clear peri-neuronal
staining surrounding D1+ MSNs, there was no specific cell
pattern that emerged from the staining. Interestingly, when these
same transgenic mice were treated with 7 days of experimenter-
administered cocaine, there was no apparent shift in cell
expression pattern of either G-CSF or its receptor (Fig. 4b).
These results are consistent with findings from the periphery

 where G-CSF is expressed in myriad cell types including
monocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts22–24, and suggest
the possibility that the effect of G-CSF on behavior is occurring
through effects on multiple cell types.
G-CSF in the NAc is increased by mPFC to NAc stimulation.
While there were clear increases in G-CSF expression in NAc
following cocaine exposure, we aimed to elucidate the underlying
mechanisms. To this end, a two-part experiment was designed to
determine if central or peripheral actions of cocaine were critical
in G-CSF induction. First, we aimed to determine if increases in
the activity of specific projection pathways in brain were capable
of increasing central or peripheral G-CSF levels using designer
receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs).
Second, using a cocaine analog (cocaine methiodide) that does
not cross the blood-brain barrier, we tested the effects of
increased peripheral cocaine on central and peripheral G-CSF
levels.
In the first series of experiments, a retrograde traveling CAV2
virus that drove the expression of Cre-recombinase was injected
into the NAc. Cre-dependent expression of the excitatory Gq-
coupled DREADD receptor was then induced in either the mPFC
or the ventral tegmental area (VTA). This allows for pathway-
specific stimulation of the mPFC to NAc or VTA to NAc
projections (Fig. 5a). 7 days of daily clozapine-N-oxide (CNO)
injections (1 mg kg−1, i.p.) robustly increased the expression of
Csf3 in the NAc after mPFC to NAc, but not after VTA to NAc,
stimulation (Fig. 5b One-way ANOVA - Main effect: F(2,12) =
13.4, p = 0.0009; Sidak post-hoc: p = 0.0037). A similar effect was
found for expression of the G-CSF receptor gene Csf3r (Fig. 5c;
Main effect: F(2,12) = 8.14, p = 0.0058; Sidak post-hoc: p = 0.0093).
Stimulation of these two pathways did not have any significant
effect on serum levels of G-CSF (Fig. 5d; Main effect F(2,12) = 1.82,
p = 0.20).
Next, we assessed whether the peripheral effects of cocaine,
independent of any centrally-mediated actions, were sufficient to
increase levels of G-CSF either in the serum or in the brain. To
this end, mice were injected daily with cocaine methiodide–a
charged analog of cocaine that does not cross the blood-brain
barrier25 (Fig. 5e). After 7 days of treatment, we found that
cocaine methiodide did not affect transcript levels of Csf3 (Fig. 5f;
two-tailed
Student’s
t-test—t(12) = 0.772,
p = 0.45)
or
Csf3r
(Fig. 5g; t(12) = 1.11, p = 0.29) in the NAc. Interestingly, serum
levels of G-CSF in cocaine methiodide-treated mice were also
unchanged (Fig. 5h; t(12) = 0.631, p = 0.54). Taken together, these
experiments suggest that G-CSF signaling in the NAc is regulated
by specific input pathways, and that peripheral upregulation of G-
CSF by cocaine likely involves feedback signaling from the CNS.
G-CSF enhances cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization. To
examine a possible causal link between systemic G-CSF and
locomotor sensitization to cocaine, mice were injected i.p. with
PBS or G-CSF (50 μg kg−1) on the morning of each monitoring
day one hour before testing (Fig. 6a). For the first 2 days, animals
then received a saline injection and activity was monitored.
Importantly, G-CSF on its own had no effect on locomotor
behavior. Following repeated injections of cocaine, there were
significant main effects of time (F (6,42) = 33.16, p < 0.0001; n = 4
PBS, 5 G-CSF) and treatment with G-CSF (F(1,7) = 8.808,
p = 0.021), as well as a significant time×treatment interaction
(F(6,42) = 3.942;
p = 0.0032).
Holm–Sidak’s
post-hoc
testing
revealed that there were significantly different effects on days 2–5
of cocaine treatment (Fig. 6a), but not on the first day of cocaine
—demonstrating
that
systemic
G-CSF enhances
locomotor
responses to repeated injections of cocaine. It is noteworthy that
in this set of experiments the PBS-treated animals seemed to
show a delayed sensitization curve, however, the G-CSF treated
animals were indeed increased when both groups seem to have
reached a plateau at day 5. Importantly, given that G-CSF can
mobilize immune cells from the bone marrow, we ensured that
prolonged treatment with G-CSF at this dose does not cause
infiltration of peripheral monocytes into the brain parenchyma
(Supplementary Fig. 1).
G-CSF alters preference formation specifically for cocaine.
While locomotor sensitization reflects behavioral plasticity asso-
ciated with repeated cocaine exposure, it is dissociable from the
subjective “rewarding” effects of cocaine. To assess whether sys-
temic G-CSF also alters the ability of an animal to associate
predictive contextual cues with the rewarding properties of
cocaine, we used an unbiased conditioned place preference (CPP)
assay in mice (typically used as a measure of cocaine “reward”)26.
We tested a range of cocaine doses beginning with a dose that
does not lead to formation of preference in control animals (3.75
mg kg−1) up to a relatively high dose (15 mg kg−1) which does.
For these experiments, animals were injected with G-CSF on each
morning of the paradigm to maintain a high serum level of G-
CSF. Treatment with G-CSF resulted in a significant leftward shift
of the dose response curve (Fig. 6b; two-way ANOVA main effect
of G-CSF: F(1,36) = 11.76, p = 0.0015) leading to the formation of a
robust preference for the lowest cocaine dose–which did not
result in significant preference in control animals (Holm-Sidak

We next determined whether G-CSF has rewarding value on its
own. In the first experiment, mice were injected with G-CSF each
morning similar to the treatments used in Supplementary Fig. 2a,
but in this case both chambers were paired with saline. Animals
did not form any preference or aversion for either chamber (two-
tailed Student’s t-test: t(7) = 0.0862, p = 0.93). In addition, we
determined if animals would form associations between pre-
dictive contextual cues and G-CSF itself. We found no preference
or aversion that resulted from G-CSF pairings (Supplementary
Fig. 2b t(8) = 0.125, p = 0.90).
We next determined if G-CSF’s modulatory effects on cocaine
reward learning were specific to cocaine or generalized to natural
reward-related behaviors. We thus performed a two-bottle
sucrose preference task in which animals choose between a water
bottle and another bottle with sucrose. Mice were treated daily
with G-CSF. We found no difference between the two treatment
groups (Supplementary Fig. 3a; two-tailed Student’s t-test:
t(7) = 0.348, p = 0.74). Taken together, these results suggest that
G-CSF enhances associative learning for drug rewards, but is not
inherently rewarding or aversive, and does not affect preference
for a natural reward.
Causally linking G-CSF signaling to reward learning. To
determine whether G-CSF is also necessary for cocaine reward
processing, we performed an experiment in which mice were
injected i.p. with a G-CSF neutralizing antibody on each day of
the CPP assay to reduce serum levels of G-CSF. Given that G-CSF
crosses the blood brain barrier15,16, but peripherally injected
antibodies do not27, this approach was intended to provide a
readout of the effect of circulating G-CSF on the formation of
place preference. There was a strong trend toward decreased
preference in these animals, but there was no statistically

 significant between-group difference (Fig. 7a; two-tailed Student’s
t-test: t(13) = 1.48, p = 0.16). However, given that cocaine treat-
ment bolsters G-CSF expression in the NAc (Fig. 3), we wanted to
test the possibility that the signal needed to be neutralized more
proximally to the site of action. For these experiments, we infused
the same G-CSF neutralizing antibody or pre-immune IgG into
the NAc using osmotic mini-pumps. When we tested place pre-
ference in these animals at the same dose, we saw that blockade of
G-CSF signaling in this brain region with neutralizing antibody
resulted in a significant reduction in the formation of cocaine
place preference (Fig. 7b; t(12.4) = 3.75, p = 0.0026).
G-CSF alters the motivation to voluntarily consume cocaine.
CPP provides a measure of associative learning. Thus, changes in
attention, learning mechanisms, or the rewarding properties of
the stimulus can all result in increased place preference. To dis-
sociate changes in reward, drug consumption, and motivation
from one another, we used drug self-administration in rats to
understand how G-CSF alters the motivational properties of
cocaine. Figure 8a outlines the timeline for these experiments.
Rats were trained to acquire cocaine self-administration on a
fixed-ratio one (FR1, 0.8 mg kg−1 per infusion) schedule of rein-
forcement, and then split into two equally balanced groups with
no significant differences in either acquisition (Fig. 8b) or cocaine
intake (Fig. 8c) over the acquisition sessions before treatment
with G-CSF or PBS, indicating that the groups were appropriately
counterbalanced.
Rats were then treated with G-CSF (50 μg kg−1 i.p.) on the
evening following the last acquisition session and each morning
30 min before each self-administration testing session to ensure
that G-CSF levels were adequately increased during testing. First,
animals underwent testing using a behavioral economics thresh-
old procedure, which is a within-session method used to assess an
animal’s motivation to self-administer a reinforcer in the face of
increasing price (in this model price is equated to the number of

 responses that the animal must emit to obtain 1 mg of drug)28,29.
Figure 8d shows the dose-response curve indicating that G-CSF-
treated animals lever-pressed more at lower doses as compared to
PBS-treated animals. It is important to note that in this
experiment price is inversely related to dose, where an increase
in price (in responses per mg) is because the dose is low. Animals
pre-treated with G-CSF increased the number of responses for
lower doses of cocaine (Fig. 8d; repeated-measures two-way
ANOVA: main effect of G-CSF: F(1,15) = 4.623, p = 0.048).
The threshold procedure is particularly powerful because it
allows for the application of economic principles to drug
consumption28. In this task, animals self-administer cocaine on
an FR1 schedule of reinforcement with no time outs. The dose
starts high, therefore the price the animal has to pay in effort
(relative price = number of responses that the animal must emit
to obtain 1 mg of drug) is very low. As the session progresses, the
dose is lowered, and animals’ response rates will increase. While
the responses increase, the relative drug consumption stays the
same. This allows the data to be plotted as demand curves by
plotting consumption as a function of price. Animals will
maintain a preferred drug level when the cost is low and
continue maintaining this level as the price of cocaine increases.
Eventually the cost becomes too great and the animal will choose
to reduce its intake. The inflection point of the curve occurs at
Pmax, the maximal price the animal is willing to pay for its
preferred dose of drug. Animals pretreated with PBS had a Pmax
of ~150 responses per milligram (Fig. 8e). Animals pretreated
with G-CSF had significantly higher Pmax at around 225 responses
per milligram (Fig. 8f, h; two-tailed Student’s t-test: t(14) = 2.002,
p = 0.033). Group demand curves were significantly different
(Fig. 8g; repeated-measures two-way ANOVA: main effect of
price: F(9,135) = 72.88, p < 0.0001; main effect of G-CSF: F(1,15) =
5.036, p = 0.04), further substantiating the interpretation of an
increase in motivation induced by G-CSF.
In addition to the G-CSF-induced increase in motivation, there
was an increase in Q0, a measure of cocaine intake (Fig. 8i; t(14) =
2.374, p = 0.016). Further supporting that G-CSF increased
consummatory
behavior,
intake
was
also
increased
on
FR1 schedule of reinforcement (Fig. 8j; t(15) = 2.87, *p = 0.12).
To assess how G-CSF affected the appetitive and consummatory
responses controlled by natural rewards, we performed a similar
threshold task using food reward, in which rats were treated with
G-CSF or PBS prior to the threshold sessions. Interestingly, G-
CSF did not affect Q0 or Pmax (Supplementary Fig. 3b, c).
Altogether, G-CSF increases both the motivation to self-
administer cocaine and the amount of cocaine an animal wants
to consume while not affecting either parameter for natural
rewards.
Discussion
Here, using quantitative serum multiplex analysis, we identify
G-CSF as an innate immune factor upregulated peripherally and
within the NAc by multiple paradigms of cocaine administration.
By using in vivo manipulations of G-CSF function, we identify its
role in promoting neural responses to cocaine, as measured by
upregulation of c-Fos, and find that G-CSF is a potent enhancer of
behavioral responses to cocaine, but not natural rewards, in
multiple behavioral tasks. Our data suggest that the locus of effect
for G-CSF in both neural and behavioral responses to cocaine is
the NAc, a limbic structure well characterized for its role in
addictive behaviors.
Of the many analytes we evaluated initially, G-CSF was chosen
for further study as it was found to be upregulated by both
experimenter-administered and self-administered cocaine, and in
a manner that correlated with behavioral output in response to
the drug. Interestingly, a number of other cytokines were upre-
gulated in one paradigm or another—an effect that may be due to
myriad causes. First, the pattern of intake in experimenter-
administered cocaine is that of a large bolus of drug given over a
few seconds. Self-administering animals took less total drug over
the course of the experiment, and the infusions were in small
doses spaced over several hours. The longer-spaced intake might
explain why some analytes such as IL-6 and KC showed matching
directional changes in both paradigms, but with smaller ampli-
tude of effect in self-administering animals. The bolus dosing that
is achieved with experimenter-administered cocaine results in a
larger surge of sympathetic nervous system activity, which has
been shown to alter immune responses30. In addition, the
voluntary nature of self-administering cocaine is complicated and

 results from combinatorial effects of multiple circuits involved in
decision making, motivation, and assessing subjective value of the
drug. In experimenter-delivered paradigms all animals are given
the same amount of drug without volitional control, which can
alter the subjective perception of the drug. This is important, as
pattern, drug level, and preferred intake level have been shown to
play a critical role in drug-induced plasticity and neural
adaptations31,32.
While this is one of the first studies to directly and causally link
a soluble immune factor to motivation for drugs of abuse, this is
not the first study to demonstrate neuroimmune interactions in
response to cocaine. Cocaine has long been known to have effects
on immune function33, and is thought to increase the risk of HIV
infection even when controlling for behavioral covariates in drug-
abusing populations34,35. Studies in humans have shown altera-
tions in cytokines long after cessation of drug use, with some of
the abnormalities correlating with extent of previous use5,36. In
addition, treatment-seeking cocaine users show enhanced serum
expression of pro-inflammatory tumor necrosis factor alpha
(TNF-α) and decreased anti-inflammatory IL-10 in response to
either stress or drug cues6.
These human studies provide correlational evidence of clinical
relevance of neuroimmune interactions in the behavioral response
to cocaine, but mechanistic studies examining the basis of such
interactions have only begun to be published7,10. A recent study by
Northcutt and colleagues used in silico modeling and binding
assays to demonstrate cocaine activation of the toll-like receptor 4
(TLR4)8. Activation of TLR4 and downstream production of
interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) in the VTA was found to be crucial for
striatal dopamine release, expression of cocaine place preference
and self-administration8. In our peripheral cytokine assays, we
found IL-1β was expressed at very low levels after experimenter-
administered cocaine, and showed a trend toward an increase after
self-administered cocaine, but no correlation was seen with
behavioral output. Another recent study found that TNF-α spe-
cifically released from microglia in the NAc was a key modulator
of neuronal and behavioral plasticity in response to cocaine, and
served as a brake on the development of locomotor sensitization9.
We did not find significant upregulation of TNF-α in our samples,
but there was a strong trend toward positive correlation between
TNF-α levels and cocaine self-administration. It is important to
note that our assays were serum based, and the studies from
Lewitus et al.9 and Northcutt et al.8 were both focused on central
cytokine signaling, with the Lewitus study focusing specifically on
microglial-derived TNF-α. In a number of other studies, G-CSF
has been shown to reduce CNS levels of both TNF-α and IL-1β37–
39, and one possible mechanism by which it may be having its
effect in our study is via affecting the production of other immune
mediators. Future studies will focus on how G-CSF affects other
innate and adaptive immune mediators in ways that influence
behavioral responses to drugs of abuse.
Once G-CSF was identified as a cytokine altered by cocaine
exposure, the next goal was to determine the role of G-CSF in
modulating cocaine-associated behaviors and to define the precise
neural mechanisms that control these effects. The receptor for G-
CSF has been shown to be expressed on neurons throughout the
CNS12,16,19, suggesting a role as a modulator of neuronal activity.
Indeed, G-CSF has been shown to induce c-Fos, a marker of
cellular activation, in midbrain neurons40. In our study, mRNA
levels of G-CSF and its receptor were induced in the NAc after
acute and chronic cocaine treatment, suggesting a role for
mesolimbic system modulation in these cocaine-mediated beha-
vioral effects. This prompted further investigation into the cel-
lular localization of G-CSF and its receptor in the NAc. We
observed expression in D1 and D2 MSNs, as well as in glial cells,
showing that receptor localization alone likely did not confer any
pathway-specific actions.
One important feature of G-CSF, defined within this study, is
its ability to modulate cocaine-induced behavioral outputs inde-
pendent of any rewarding effects of G-CSF itself. Further,
G-CSF
did
not
alter
sucrose
preference,
food-maintained
responding on low effort schedules, or motivation for food
rewards, suggesting that G-CSF could provide a powerful tool to
modulate addictive behaviors with limited side effects on natu-
rally rewarding stimuli. The disparity between the modulation of
drug and food is particularly interesting; however, not surprising.
While motivation for food and drugs of abuse are modulated by
some of the same circuitry41, motivation for food has many
redundant pathways that can modulate motivation42,43. Further,
homeostatic pathways driving food intake are tightly regulated
and are modulated by internal state and need44,45. It is possible
that G-CSF is only capable of modulating reward behaviors that
are particularly salient. It would be interesting in the future to
conduct experiments that modulate satiety state to determine if
G-CSF is capable of altering motivation for food when need is
high.
Our studies provide insight into the central role of G-CSF in
controlling the neural and behavioral responses to cocaine and
define the locus of these effects to specific projection pathways. G-
CSF signaling in the NAc was critical in modulating the beha-
vioral responses to cocaine, as a G-CSF-neutralizing antibody
injected peripherally resulted in only a slight decrease in the
formation of cocaine conditioned place preference, but infusion
directly into the NAc robustly decreased behavior. Further, c-Fos
has been shown to be robustly induced in NAc by acute cocaine
exposure3,17,46, and we found that pre-treatment with systemic
G-CSF significantly potentiated this induction, suggesting that G-
CSF acts to increase the activity of cells in the NAc either directly
or through modulation of inputs into the region. Interestingly, c-
Fos was also increased in the mPFC and the increased activity was

 correlated between the mPFC and NAc regions, suggesting that
activity of this specific projection pathway may play a role.
We conducted two separate experiments to determine how
cocaine was acting to increase G-CSF levels within the brain.
First, we used a brain impenetrable cocaine analog, cocaine
methiodide, to see if central actions of cocaine were necessary to
increase G-CSF levels. We did not see increases in either central
or peripheral levels of G-CSF, suggesting that the increase in
serum G-CSF is dependent on some component of signaling from
the CNS and that cocaine induction of G-CSF in NAc requires
central actions of the drug.
Second, we used pathway-specific DREADD stimulation to
determine if activation of mPFC to NAc or VTA to NAc circuits
in isolation were sufficient on their own to change G-CSF levels.

Fig. 8 G-CSF increases the motivation to self-administer cocaine. a Experimental timeline. Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine on a fixed-ratio one
(FR1) schedule of reinforcement. Animals went through two behavioral tasks: the threshold procedure to assess motivation, and FR1 self-administration to
assess consumption. b Acquisition for the two experimental groups before treatment showing that there were no significant differences before the

did not differ in the two groups before G-CSF or PBS treatment (Student’s t-test; t(16) = 0.427, p = 0.34). d Dose-response curves. G-CSF pretreatment

 We found that G-CSF and its receptor in the NAc were induced
only by stimulation of the glutamatergic mPFC to NAc pathway,
but not the VTA to NAc pathway. Interestingly, G-CSF is also
robustly and rapidly upregulated in the CNS in response to stroke
or other neuronal insults in which there is rapid upregulation of
glutamatergic signaling16, and has repeatedly been shown to be
neuroprotective in models of stroke and neurodegenerative con-
ditions11,12,20. In the case of cocaine abuse, this sets forth an
interesting positive feed-forward model where cocaine-induced
activation of the mPFC to NAc pathway is capable of increasing
brain G-CSF levels. G-CSF in the brain can then enhance cocaine-
induced neuronal activation in these regions, further augmenting
the rewarding and reinforcing properties of cocaine itself.
While we have defined a causal role of G-CSF in several models
of cocaine reward, motivation, and the plasticity induced by
repeated exposure, one of the most interesting things about G-
CSF was its lack of effect on its own. G-CSF did not induce CPP
or lead to a large increase in c-Fos expression in brain, but rather
played a role in enhancing stimulus-driven activation and
learning mechanisms. In our behavioral assays, G-CSF augments
the formation of locomotor sensitization in response to cocaine,
leads to enhanced formation of conditioned place preference, and
enhances motivation to self-administer cocaine, but does not
affect preference for, or intake of, natural rewards. Other studies
have demonstrated significant behavioral and cognitive effects of
G-CSF in animal models. Mice with a constitutive knockout of G-
CSF have significantly impaired performance on a Morris Water
Maze task, and do not form hippocampal LTP in ex vivo slice
preparations14. Treatment of animals with exogenous G-CSF
during a spatial learning task enhances acquisition of the task47,
and cognitive impairments in animal models of Alzheimer’s
pathology are slowed or reversed by treatment with G-CSF37,48. It
is possible that signaling downstream of G-CSF enhances synaptic
connectivity in ways that promote associations of context or cues
with a rewarding stimulus such as cocaine.
Giving further credence to this idea is our self-administration
data showing that G-CSF modulates performance, without dis-
rupting it, on tasks where animals are making complex decisions
about economic value. This is important for two reasons. First, it
is important that simple measures of reward are not con-
taminated with reductions in arousal, attention, or cognitive
performance. For tasks like conditioned place preference, this can
be the case as it depends on associative learning mechanisms.
Thus, animals that cannot attend to cues or have impaired
memory will exhibit behaviors that look like reduced reward.
However, with behavioral economics tasks, animals have to make
complex decisions in a changing environment; thus, a drug that
alters factors other than motivation and reward value would
prevent animals from effectively completing the task. G-CSF did
not alter the ability of animals to complete the self-administration
tasks, suggesting that it modulates reward and reinforcement
directly. Second, a major shortcoming of some behavioral para-
digms is that findings have not translated to the clinic. Behavioral
economics provides a potential tool to improve this translation.
Indeed, Pmax is disrupted in drug-addicted human subjects49, and
is directly correlated with addiction severity, where increased
Pmax, and reduced sensitivity to cost, are characteristics of drug
addiction. Thus, treatments that allow individuals to reduce the
value that they place on cocaine, without disrupting decision-
making processes, are critical to develop cocaine treatments. G-
CSF has these components, and here we show that G-CSF can
directly modulate Pmax and that reducing G-CSF levels reduces
cocaine reward, providing a potential therapeutic target for the
treatment of drug addiction.
Altogether, this work has defined the role of a soluble immune
factor in complex behavior related to addiction, defined the
mechanistic and causal role G-CSF in this process, and provides a
potential pharmacotherapeutic target to improve treatment out-
comes in addicted individuals. While these studies suggest that
increases in G-CSF may be maladaptive in the setting of drug
abuse, targeted manipulations of G-CSF and its downstream
signaling pathways may represent tractable treatment strategies.
These findings represent an important advance in the under-
standing of the pathophysiology of, and possible treatment for,
substance use disorders. Identification of an innate immune
effector that is capable of affecting behavioral responses to
cocaine has high relevance for potential clinical translation, and
recombinant G-CSF has been FDA-approved for many years to
treat neutropenia50 and is now in clinical trials for both stroke51
and Alzheimer’s disease52. The idea of using an immune mod-
ulator to treat psychiatric pathology is not novel, and early stage
clinical trials of pharmacotherapies aimed at targeting the
immune system have shown promise in treating major depressive
disorder53. Treatment with a G-CSF modulator would have the
distinct advantage that it may be harnessed to reduce drug taking
while ostensibly having no abuse potential on its own—a known
confound in many previous trials for psychostimulant use dis-
orders4. While further study and care will be necessary before
transitioning these findings toward a clinical population, we posit
that this study represents the possibility of a highly tractable
strategy for clinical translation with a good potential for success.
Methods
Animals. Male C57BL/6 J mice (7wks old ~20–25 g; Jackson Laboratories, Bar
Harbor, ME) and Sprague-Dawley rats (350–375 g; Envigo, Somerset, NJ) were
housed in the animal facilities at Mount Sinai. For all experiments other than self-
administration, mice were maintained on a 12:12 h light/dark cycle (0700 hours
lights on; 1900 hours lights off). Animals were provided with food and water ad lib
throughout the experiments. For self-administration studies, mice and rats were
maintained on a 12:12 h reverse light/dark cycle (0700 hours lights off; 1900 hours
lights on). Animals were food restricted to 95% of free feeding weight throughout
the duration of self-administration experiments. Food restriction and reverse light
cycle serve to improve consistency of the self-administration task. All animals were
maintained according to the National Institutes of Health guidelines in Association
for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care accredited facilities.
All experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee at Mount Sinai.
Serum multiplex analysis. Adult male mice were treated with experimenter-
administered (20 mg kg−1 per day i.p.) or self-administered (0.5 mg kg−1 per
infusion i.v. × 2 h/day) cocaine for 10 days during which locomotor sensitization
behavior and self-administration intake were monitored respectively. Mice were
analyzed 24 h after the final dose of cocaine and trunk blood was collected. Blood
was allowed to sit at room temperature for at least one hour to allow for full
clotting. Samples were then spun at 1200×g for 15 min and the supernatant was
saved as serum. Multiplex analysis was performed using the commercially available
mouse cytokine/chemokine magnetic bead panel (Millipore MCYTMAG-70K-
PX32) on a Luminex 200 multiplex immunoassay system at the Human Immune
Monitoring Core at Mount Sinai. Assays were quality control checked for fit to a
standard curve, and for coefficient of variation of < 2.5%. For analytes below the
lower level of detection (LLD) of the assay, values were imputed as 0.5* LLD as has
been reported previously54. There were six analytes for which > 60% of values were
below the lower limit of detection (IFN-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-17, LIF) and these
were excluded from further analysis. For correlational analysis serum levels of each
analyte were compared to the level of locomotor sensitization exhibited (Day10/
Day1 Locomotor activity) or to the average daily self-administration during stable
self-administration (Days 5–10).
qPCR. For biochemical experiments mouse brain punches were taken from animals
sacrificed either 90 min after an acute injection of cocaine (20 mg kg−1) or 24 h
after 7 daily injections of cocaine (20 mg kg−1). Brain punches were analyzed fol-
lowing the described treatments and brain tissue was rapidly dissected on ice and
frozen on dry ice. RNA isolation and qPCR were performed as described pre-
viously55,56. Briefly, RNA was extracted by homogenizing tissue in Qiazol reagent
(Qiagen) and purified using RNeasy micro kits from Qiagen according to manu-
facturer protocols. RNA concentration and quality were assessed using a Nano-
Drop spectrophotometer (Thermo). Reverse transcription was performed using
iScript (BioRad) according to manufacturer protocols. qPCR using SYBER green
master mix (Quanta) was carried out using an Applied Biosystems 7900HT cycler
with the following parameters: 2 min at 95 °C; 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 59 °C for

 30 s, 72 °C for 33 s; and graded heating to 95 °C to generate dissociation curves to
confirm amplification of a single PCR product. Primer pairs were designed using
the NCBI/Primer-BLAST tool to identify primers unique for the intended target
and were confirmed to amplify only a single product. Those used for amplification
are available as Supplementary Table 1. Data were normalized to Gapdh as a
housekeeping gene and analyzed by comparing C(t) values of control and G-CSF
treated mice using the ΔΔC(t) method.
DREADD experiments. For these experiments, we utilized AAV2-hSyn-DIO-
hM3Dq-mCherry (Gq-DREADD) purchased from the viral core at the University
of North Carolina, Chapel Hill as well as the retrograding Canine adenovirus type 2
(CAV2)-Cre from the Institut de Génétique Moléculaire de Montpellier (Mon-
tpellier, France). Mice were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg kg−1) and xylazine
(10 mg kg−1) and positioned in a stereotactic frame. Ophthalmic ointment was
placed in the eyes to prevent drying. A midline incision was made in the scalp and
craniotomies were made using a dental drill. A 10 μl Nanofil Hamilton syringe
(WPI, Sarasota, FL) with a 34-gauge beveled metal needle was used to infuse 0.5 μl
virus at a rate of 100 nl/min. After the infusion, the needle was kept at the injection
site for 10 min then slowly withdrawn. All animals received infusion of the CAV2-
Cre virus in the NAc (From bregma: anteroposterior + 1.6 mm; mediolateral + 1.5
mm; dorsoventral −4.4 mm). Animals were then split into three experimental
groups: (1) Control animals received no additional viral injections (2) mPFC-
DREADD animals received an infusion of Gq-DREADD in the medial prefrontal
cortex (From bregma: anterioposterior + 1.7 mm; mediolateral + 0.75 mm; dorso-
ventral −2.5 mm at 15°), and (3) VTA-DREADD animals received infusion of Gq-
DREADD into the ventral tegmental area (From bregma: anteroposterior −3.3 mm;
mediolateral +1.05 mm; dorsoventral −4.6 mm at an angle of 7°). Animals in all
groups then received injections of clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) 1 mg kg−1 i.p. daily
for 7 days and animals were sacrificed for analysis. Expression of DREADD virus in
the desired location was confirmed with qPCR for mCherry.
Cocaine methiodide. To assess the effects of peripheral cocaine on expression of
G-CSF in both the periphery and the CNS we utilized the charge cocaine analog
cocaine methiodide—which does not cross the blood brain barrier25 to dissociate
central vs. peripheral effects. For these experiments animals received daily injec-
tions of cocaine methiodide (20 mg kg−1) or saline for 7 days and were then
sacrificed 24 h after the final dose for analysis.
Locomotor sensitization. Locomotor sensitization was measured, as described56.
Activity was monitored in rat-sized cages free of bedding that were set up in a
locomotor apparatus designed to measure extent of ambulations in the x and y
planes. On each of the assessment days the animals were given an injection of G-
CSF (50 μg kg−1, i.p.)48 in their home cage 30 min prior to injection of saline or
cocaine. On the first 2 days of each experiment the animals then received an i.p.
injection of normal saline (10 ml kg−1) and locomotor activity was monitored for
45 min. For each of the next 5 days animals were injected with 7.5 mg kg−1 cocaine
i.p. and their activity was monitored for 45 min.
Conditioned place preference. An unbiased conditioned place preference assay
was carried out as described previously56. In brief, mice were evaluated for cocaine
place preference using three chambered CPP Med Associates boxes and software.
The two end chambers have distinct visual (gray vs. striped walls) and tactile (small
grid vs. large grid flooring) cues to allow differentiation. On the pre-test day,
animals were allowed to freely explore all three chambers for 20 min and those that
showed a significant preference for one of the two chambers were excluded from
further analysis (<10% of animals tested). Groups were then balanced and adjusted
to balance out any pre-existing chamber bias. For G-CSF dose–response experi-
ments, animals were injected each day with G-CSF (50 μg kg−1, i.p.) in their home
cage one hour prior to the start of any conditioning. For G-CSF neutralizing
antibody experiments animals were injected with anti-G-CSF antibody (10 μg, i.p.)
one hour before the start of each day, and minipump animals had anti-G-CSF
infused into the NAc at a rate of 1 μg/side/day (details below). CPP was carried out
by pairing an injection of saline with one chamber in the morning, and a second
injection of cocaine (3.75, 7.5, 15 mg kg−1) with the other chamber in the afternoon
for two consecutive days. A cocaine dose of 7.5 mg kg−1 was used for G-CSF
antibody experiments. Conditioned place preference testing was carried out on the
fourth day when each animal was again allowed to explore all chambers freely.
Place preference score was taken as time on the cocaine paired side—time on the
saline paired side.
Minipump experiments. Mice were surgically implanted with two subcutaneous
Alzet minipumps (Durect corporation model 1007D) and bilateral guide cannulae
(Plastics One) targeting the nucleus accumbens. On the day before surgery can-
nulae were loaded with antibody solution and attached to pumps filled with either
anti-G-CSF or pre-immune IgG. The pumps were set to each deliver 1 μg of
antibody/day based on flow rate. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with Ketamine
(100 mg kg−1) and Xylazine (10 mg kg−1) and an incision was made over the skull
and the skin over the scapulae was blunt dissected from underlying fascia to allow
for implantation of the pumps. Bilateral cannulae were delivered into the NAc
according to previously published coordinates (From bregma: anteroposterior, +
1.5; mediolateral, + 1.0; dorsoventral, −4.5)57. The cannulae were permanently fixed
to the skull with Loctite adhesive, and cannulae tubing and pumps were all secured
under the skin using several interrupted sutures.
Sucrose preference. To test for preference for natural rewards individually housed
mice were allowed to habituate to two bottles of water for 1 day followed by three
consecutive days of one bottle of water and one bottle of 1% sucrose. The bottles
were weighed daily and the side was switched each day to prevent animals forming
a preference for location. The ratio of sucrose/water intake was used as the measure
of preference.
Self-Administration surgery and training. Rats and mice were anesthetized with
ketamine (100 mg kg−1) and xylazine (10 mg kg−1) and implanted with chronic
indwelling jugular catheters as described31. Animals were singly housed, and all
sessions took place during the active/dark cycle (1200–1500 hours). After a 6-day
recovery period, animals underwent training for self-administration where they
were given access to a cocaine-paired lever on a fixed ratio one (FR1) schedule,
which, upon responding, initiated an intravenous injection of cocaine (0.8 mg kg−1
for rats, 0.5 mg kg−1 for mice, infused over 5 s). After each response/infusion, the
lever was retracted and a stimulus light was illuminated for a 20 s timeout period. A
second lever (the inactive lever) was available; however, responding on this lever
was recorded, but resulted in no programmed consequence. Acquisition was
considered to have occurred when an animal allocated > 70% of their responses on
the active lever (and > 20 injections) for two consecutive days and a stable pattern
of infusion intervals was present. Subsequently animals went on to complete the
threshold procedure (described in detail below) to assess how GCSF altered the
motivational properties of cocaine.
Threshold procedure. Following acquisition of cocaine self-administration, the
threshold procedure was used to determine differences in cocaine consumption
and motivation between groups. A total of 20 animals underwent surgery and 4
were discarded to do catheter failure or failure to meet acquisition criteria. A total
of 16 animals performed the threshold procedure. For this procedure, rats were
injected with G-CSF (50 μg kg−1) thirty minutes prior to each testing session20,58.
The threshold procedure is a behavioral economics approach to assessing drug
taking/seeking and reinforcing efficacy28,29. It consists of giving rats access to
reinforcer while increasing the price, in effort, an animal must pay to obtain the
reward. For the procedure with cocaine a descending series of 11 unit doses of
cocaine (421, 237, 133, 75, 41, 24, 13, 7.5, 4.1, 2.4, and 1.3 μg/injection) are available
on an FR1 schedule of reinforcement with no timeout. Each dose is available for 10
min, with each bin presented consecutively across the 110-min session. A similar
approach was used for food reinforcement; however, increasing price was achieved
by increasing the FR requirement (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 14, 18, 25, 31, 44, 56, 78, 100)
to obtain each food pellet. During this time, the lever is never retracted, and the
only time out periods occur during the infusion of cocaine or the delivery of food.
By plotting the consumption of cocaine or food as a function of price (number of
responses need to obtain 1 mg of cocaine/food) demand curves are generated
(Fig. 4) and behavioral economic principles can be applied to assess a variety of
economic measures (described in detail below). During the initial bins of the
procedure the dose is high, thus minimal effort is needed to obtain a preferred level
of drug, i.e., the cost of cocaine is low. With decreasing doses the cost progressively
increases and animals are required to exert more effort to obtain their preferred
level of cocaine. Eventually, the dose becomes low enough that preferred levels of
cocaine cannot be maintained and responding decreases. This point, where the
cocaine level cannot be maintained (i.e., the first derivative point slope of the
function = −1) is termed the Pmax, or the maximal price paid. Pmax is directly
correlated with traditional measures of reinforcing efficacy like progressive ratio
responding28,54. Shifts in responding across the demand curve can be analyzed
using behavioral economics principles, as described below. Responding during the
first bin of the procedure is considered to reflect a loading phase and is not
included in the analyses.
Behavioral economic analysis was used to determine the parameters of maximal
price paid (Pmax) and consumption at a minimally constraining price (Q0), as
described previously28,59,60. Briefly, Pmax and Q0 values were derived
mathematically using a demand curve. Demand curves were generated by curve-
fitting individual animals’ intake using an equation: log(Q) = log(Q0) + k × (e−α ×
Q0 × C−1)61,62. In this equation, Pmax was determined to be the unit price at which
the first derivative point slope of the function = −163. The value k was set to two for
all animals61,62.
Q0: Q0 is a measure of the animals’ preferred level of cocaine consumption. This
can be measured when the dose is high and cocaine is available at low effort, or a
minimally constraining price. This preferred level of consumption is established in
the early bins of the threshold procedure.
Pmax: Price is expressed as the responses emitted to obtain 1 mg of cocaine, thus
as the dose is decreased in each consecutive bin of the threshold procedure, price
increases. As the session progresses, animals must increase responding on the
active lever in order to maintain stable intake. Pmax is the price at which the animal
no longer emits enough responses to maintain intake and consumptions decreases.

 Thus, animals with higher Pmax will increase responding to maintain cocaine levels
farther into the demand curve; in other words, they will pay a higher price for
cocaine. Previous work has demonstrated that Pmax is highly correlated with break
points on a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement, confirming that the
threshold procedure accurately assesses reinforcing efficacy29,60.
Immunohistochemistry. For these studies, we utilized two transgenic mouse lines.
CX3CR1GFP/CCR2RFP mice express GFP in microglia and RFP in peripherally
derived monocytes64, and were generously provided by Dr. Miriam Merad. In
addition, to identify cells expressing the D1-type dopamine receptor we utilized
D1-tomato mice purchased from Jackson Labs (Stock #: 016204). Staining was
performed using previously published methods65. Briefly, mice were transcardially
perfused first with ice-cold PBS and then with a fixative solution containing 4%
PFA paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brains were post-fixed for 24 h in 4% PFA at 4 °C.
Sections of 30 µm thickness were cut in the frontal plane with a vibratome (Leica,
Nussloch, Germany) and stored at −20 °C in a solution. Sections were permeabi-
lized with 0.2% Triton X-100, followed by blocking with 35 normal donkey serum.
Primary antibodies against G-CSF (Abcam, ab181053, 1:500 dilution), GCSF-
Receptor (Life Science, LS-C393437, 1:100 dilution) and ds-Red/tdTomato (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, sc-390909, 1:500) were diluted in blocking solution and sec-
tions incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking. Sections were then incubated
with secondary antibodies (donkey anti-mouse or anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488,
donkey anti-goat Rhodamine Red, donkey anti-rabbit Cy5; Jackson ImmunoR-
esearch, 1:500 dilution) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, sections were
incubated for 5 min with DAPI (NucBlue, Invitrogen) to achieve counterstaining of
nuclei before mounting in Prolong Gold (Invitrogen). Protein expression was
assessed in the nucleus accumbens using a LSM 710 laser-scanning confocal
microscope (Carl Zeiss) imaged using a ×20, ×40 or ×63 objective with a 1.0 digital
zoom.
Statistical analysis. All statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism.
Pairwise comparisons were performed using a two-tailed Student’s t-test with
Welch’s correction when appropriate. One factor comparisons were performed
using one-way ANOVA and Sidak’s post-hoc tests. 2 × 2 comparisons were per-
formed using two-way ANOVA with repeated measures and Holm-Sidak’s post-
hoc tests. Correlational analyses were performed using Pearson’s correlation
analysis.
