Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent age-associated dementia with no treatments that can prevent or
slow its progression. Since age is by far the major risk factor for AD, there is a strong rationale for an alternative
approach to drug discovery based upon the biology of aging. Phenotypic screening assays that reflect multiple,
age-associated neurotoxicity pathways rather than single molecular targets can identify compounds that have
therapeutic efficacy by targeting aspects of aging that contribute to AD pathology. And, while the suitability of
any single assay can be questioned, a combination of assays can make reliable predictions about the neuro-
protective effects of compounds in vivo. Therefore, our lab has developed a combination of phenotypic screening
assays that are ideally suited not only to identify novel neuroprotective compounds for the treatment of AD but
also their target pathways, thereby potentially providing new therapeutic targets for disease treatment. Using
these assays, we screened a large library of extracts from plants with identified pharmacological uses. Analysis of
one of these extracts from the plant Yerba santa (Eriodictyon californicum) identified the flavanone sterubin as the
active component and further studies showed it to be a potent neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory com-
pound.
1. Introduction
Since the 1990's, the combination of molecular and structural
biology, combinatorial chemistry and high throughput screening has
dominated drug discovery [1]. This approach provides a rapid process
for the discovery of drug candidates with high selectivity and affinity
for a specific molecular target. However, it has not produced the suc-
cesses that were initially expected, especially with respect to complex
neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Prior to the development of this target-based drug discovery para-
digm, new drugs were discovered by evaluating chemicals against ob-
servable characteristics or phenotypes in biological systems such as
cells or animals. This method is known as phenotypic screening. While
this approach has fallen out of favor with the pharmaceutical industry,
surprisingly a recent study showed that it still continues to be more
successful than target-based approaches for the identification of first in
class small molecule drugs [2]. It has been argued that this is because
target-based discovery is based on a priori assumptions that do not take
into account the complexities of biological systems [2,3]. Moreover,
phenotypic screening against human disease models can lead to the
identification of new, disease-related molecular pathways and targets.
The ideal phenotypic drug screening paradigm would employ the
ultimate end user-humans; and this is how most of the natural product-
based, first in class drugs were originally discovered. However, for
obvious reasons, this strategy is no longer ethically viable. Laboratory
animals, primarily disease models in mice, are currently used for pre-
clinical testing. However, using them for the initial screening of drug
candidates is impractical due to cost and time constraints as well as the
drive to reduce animal use in research. A reasonable alternative is to
create cell-based assays based on toxicity pathways relevant to age-
associated neurodegeneration and use these assays to identify novel
drug candidates. In this way, the screening paradigms have disease
relevance, reproducibility and reasonable throughput.
Many arguments can be made against the relevance of any single
cellular screening assay, based on the cell type or the nature of the toxic
insult. Thus, to account for individual weaknesses, our phenotypic
screening approach combines multiple assays. This enables the identi-
fication of potent, disease-modifying compounds for preclinical testing
in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases. In general, these as-
says involve primary neurons, neuron-like cell lines or microglial cell

 lines that are subjected to toxic insults that have been observed to occur
in the aging brain and to a larger extent in AD.
In this report, we describe the use of these assays to screen a com-
mercial library of extracts from plants with identified pharmacological
uses and the identification of a previously uncharacterized neuropro-
tective flavonoid. All plant extracts were first tested in the oxytosis
assay in HT22 mouse hippocampal nerve cells. Extracts that were po-
sitive in this assay were then screened in additional assays including:
protection against energy depletion in HT22 hippocampal nerve cells,
intracellular amyloid toxicity in MC65 human nerve cells, inhibition of
inflammation mediated by microglial activation using BV-2 mouse
microglial cells and differentiation of rat PC12 cells. These assays re-
flect multiple, age-associated neurotoxicity/survival pathways directly
relevant to AD, such as increased oxidative stress and glutathione (GSH)
depletion, reduced energy metabolism, accumulation of misfolded,
aggregated proteins, loss of neurotrophic support and inflammation
[3]. In addition, these particular models were selected to provide a
replicable, cost- and time-effective screening approach.
2. Materials and methods
All reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO,
USA), unless otherwise stated. The plant extract library was obtained
from
Caithness
Biotechnologies
(Leicester,
UK).
Eriodictyol
and
homoeriodictyol were purchased from Indofine Chemical Company
(Hillsborough, NJ, USA). Sterubin was a gift from Jakob Ley at Symrise
AG (Holzminden, Germany).
2.1. Phenotypic screening assays
2.1.1. Oxytosis (HT22 cells)
This assay, also called oxidative glutamate toxicity, tests the ability
of compounds to rescue cells from oxidative stress-induced pro-
grammed cell death caused by GSH depletion after treatment with
glutamate [4]. A reduction in GSH is seen in the aging brain and is
accelerated in AD [5]. The depletion of GSH from cells leads to lipox-
ygenase activation, reactive oxygen species production and calcium
influx which initiates a form of programmed cell death with features
similar to those implicated in the nerve cell damage seen in AD [6].
Because of the generality of the toxicity pathway in oxytosis and its
mechanistic association with aging and AD [7,8], it is used as our pri-
mary screen. In this assay, 5 × 103 HT22 mouse hippocampal nerve
cells, grown in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium
(DMEM) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal
calf serum (FCS) (Hyclone, Logan, UT, USA), were plated in 96 well
plates. After 24 h of culture, the medium was exchanged with fresh
medium and 5 mM glutamate and the indicated concentrations/dilu-
tions of extracts/fractions/compounds were added. After 24 h of
treatment, viability was measured by the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-
2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay as previously described
[9]. Results were confirmed by visual inspection of the wells.
2.1.2. Anti-inflammatory activity (BV-2 cells)
Inflammation is a major feature of AD [10]. Microglia are the re-
sident immune cell population of the CNS and activated, pro-in-
flammatory microglia are implicated in the pathogenesis of AD [10].
Activated microglia produce a wide array of pro-inflammatory and
cytotoxic factors including cytokines, free radicals, excitatory neuro-
transmitters and eicosanoids that may work in concert to promote
neurodegeneration [10]. Thus, inhibiting the generation of activated
pro-inflammatory microglia is another important therapeutic target for
AD. Briefly, mouse BV2 microglial cells were grown in low glucose
DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. For the assay the cells were plated
at 5 × 105 cells in 35 mm tissue culture dishes. After growth overnight,
the cells were treated with 50 µg/ml bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
alone or in the presence of the extracts/compounds. After 24 h the
medium was removed, spun briefly to remove floating cells and 100 µl
assayed for nitrite using 100 µl of the Griess Reagent in a 96 well plate.
After incubation for 10 min at room temperature the absorbance at
550 nm was read on a microplate reader, as described previously [11].
The levels of IL-6, IL1β and TNF-α in the supernatants were determined
using ELISAs (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the
manufacturer's instruction.
2.1.3. Neurotrophic activity (PC12 cell differentiation)
Connections between nerve cells are altered in AD. Thus, com-
pounds that can promote the regeneration of these connections might
be of particular benefit, thereby promoting the recovery of higher
neuronal function. As a model for this property, we used neurite out-
growth in rat PC12 cells, a well-studied model system of neuronal dif-
ferentiation. In response to neurotrophic factors such as nerve growth
factor (NGF), PC12 cells undergo a series of physiological changes
culminating in a phenotype resembling that of sympathetic neurons
[12]. In this assay, PC12 cells (originally obtained from Greene [13])
grown in high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and 5%
horse serum were plated in 35 mm tissue culture dishes. After 3 days of
growth, the medium was replaced with serum-free N2 medium (In-
vitrogen) and the cells were treated with the extracts/compounds. After
24 h the cells were scored for the presence of neurites. PC12 cells
produce neurites much more rapidly when treated in N2 medium than
when treated in regular growth medium. For each treatment, 100 cells
in each of three separate fields were counted. Cells were scored positive
if one or more neurites longer than one cell body diameter in length
were observed [14].
2.1.4. Protection against energy loss (HT22 cells)
A breakdown in neuronal energy production leading to adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) loss is associated with nerve cell damage and death
in AD [15]. In order to induce ATP loss, we used the compound io-
doacetic acid (IAA) in combination with the HT22 hippocampal nerve
cells. IAA has been used in a number of other studies to cause a rapid
loss of ATP [16]. HT22 cells were seeded onto 96 well plates as de-
scribed in the oxytosis assay. The medium was exchanged 24 h later
with fresh medium and the cells were treated with 20 µM IAA alone
(which results in 90–95% cell death) or in the presence of extracts/
compounds. After 2 h the medium in each well was aspirated and re-
placed with fresh medium without IAA but containing the extracts/
compounds. After 24 h of treatment, viability was measured by the MTT
assay. Results were confirmed by visual inspection of the wells.
2.1.5. Intracellular abeta toxicity (MC65 cells)
Accumulation of intracellular amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) is con-
sidered by many as being a primary toxic event in AD [17]. The human
nerve cell line MC65 conditionally expresses the C99 fragment of the
amyloid precursor protein (APP) leading to the accumulation of in-
tracellular Aβ. The MC65 cells are routinely grown in the presence of
tetracycline and, following its removal, the expression of C99 is induced
and the cells die within 4 days because of the accumulation of in-
tracellular, toxic protein aggregates [18,19]. Briefly, MC65 cells were
regularly grown in high glucose DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS.
For the assay, cells were dissociated and plated at 4 × 105 cells per
35 mm tissue culture dishes in Opti-minimal essential media (Opti-
MEM, Invitrogen) in the presence (no induction) or absence (APP-C99
induced) of 1 μg/ml tetracycline in the presence or absence of the in-
dicated extracts/compounds. At day 4, the control cells in the absence
of tetracycline were dead, and cell viability was determined by the MTT
assay, as previously described [19].
2.2. HPLC fractionation
Initially, the plant extract (1 µl of original DMSO extract) was di-
luted with 150 µl of 50% aqueous acetonitrile and injected onto a Vydac

 C-18 column (4.6 × 250 mm). A linear gradient was run over 30 min,
beginning at 9% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and increasing
to 90% acetonitrile with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Absorbance was
monitored at 330 nm. One milliliter fractions were collected auto-
matically for the entire gradient. Fractions were dried in vacuo em-
ploying a Savant Speed-Vac concentrator and fractions were re-dis-
solved in DMSO before testing in the oxytosis assay described above.
Once the active fraction was identified, a shallower HPLC gradient was
employed
(40 min,

acetonitrile
in
0.1%
tri-
fluoroacetic acid increasing to 54% acetonitrile with a flow rate of
1 ml/min) and fractions surrounding the active peak were collected
manually based on absorbance at 330 nm. An aliquot of these fractions
was dried in vacuo and assayed in the oxytosis assay. The active fraction
was then subjected to mass spectrometric analysis.
2.3. Mass spectrometry
The fraction eluting at 19.4 min under the HPLC conditions de-
scribed above was diluted 1:100 with 1% formic acid in methanol/
water. The analyte was directly infused into a ThermoFisher Q Exactive
mass spectrometer (Waltham, MA, USA) via a micro-flow source. A
major signal was detected at m/z = 303.09 (singly charged). The signal
was isolated and subjected to HCD fragmentation at a normalized col-
lision energy setting of 45. MS/MS spectra were recorded and averaged
for 2 min. After the analysis of the natural compound, spectra were also
recorded for the synthetic compounds (homoeriodictyol, hesperitin,
and sterubin), all of which possess a predicted precursor mass of MH+
= 303.09. Only the MS/MS spectrum of pure sterubin exhibited a
match with that of the isolated natural product.
2.4. Measurement of total glutathione (tGSH)
For measurement of tGSH, 3 × 105 HT22 cells were plated in 60 mm
dishes. After 24 h of culture, the medium was exchanged with fresh
medium and the indicated concentrations of glutamate and the com-
pounds were added. The cells were treated for 2–24 h and then scraped
into ice-cold PBS and 10% sulfosalicylic acid was added at a final
concentration of 3.3%. GSH was determined by the recycling assay
based on the reduction of 5,5-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) with glu-
tathione reductase and NADPH [20] and normalized to protein re-
covered from the acid-precipitated pellet by treatment with 0.2 N NaOH
at 37 °C overnight and measured by the bicinchoninic acid assay
(Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA).
2.5. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) measurement
HT22 cells were seeded onto 96-well black walled microtiter plates
at a density of 5 × 103 cells per well. The next day, the cells were
treated with the 2.5–10 µM sterubin, eriodictyol or homoeridodictyol
alone or in the presence of 5 mM glutamate for 7 h. The medium was
then replaced with 100 µl loading medium (phenol red-free Hank's
balanced salt solution containing 10 µM CM-H2DCFDA). After 30 min in
CM-H2DCFDA (C6827, Invitrogen), the fluorescence (λ excitation =
495 nm, λ emission = 525 nM) was determined using a Molecular
Devices microplate reader (San Jose, CA, USA). Each treatment was
done in sextuplicate. DCFDA fluorescence was normalized to control
cells not exposed to metals or glutamate.
2.6. Iron binding
Ferrous iron binding was measured using ferrozine as described
[21]. Briefly, different dilutions of sterubin, eriodicyol and homo-
eridictyol were mixed with an equal volume of 5 µM FeCl2 in 50 mM
HEPES, pH 7.5 in a 96 well plate. After 2 min, 50 µl of 5 mM ferrozine
was added and the absorbance at 562 nm measured on a Molecular
Devices microplate reader. The amount of remaining iron was calcu-
lated from the difference in absorbance between the sample with fer-
rozine and the same sample without ferrozine divided by the difference
between the control sample (iron plus ferrozine) and its blank (iron
alone).
2.7. Western blots
2.7.1. Sample preparation
For Western blotting, 3 × 105 HT22 cells per 60 mm dish were
grown for 24 h prior to the indicated treatments. For nuclear extracts,
cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (TBS), scraped
into ice-cold nuclear fractionation buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9,
10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM Na3VO4,
1× protease inhibitor cocktail and 1× phosphatase inhibitor cocktail)
and incubated on ice for 15 min. Then NP40 at a final concentration of
0.6% was added, cells were vortexed and the nuclei pelleted by cen-
trifugation. Nuclear proteins were extracted by sonication of the nu-
clear pellet in nuclear fractionation buffer and the extracts were cleared
by additional centrifugation. Total protein extracts were prepared by
rinsing the cells twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells
were scraped into lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl,
50 mM NaF, 10 mM Na pyrophosphate, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100,
1 mM Na3VO4, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail, 1× phosphatase in-
hibitor cocktail) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Extracts were soni-
cated and cleared by centrifugation. The supernatants were stored at
− 70 °C until analysis. Protein concentrations were quantified by the
bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce) and adjusted to equal concentra-
tions. 5× Western blot sample buffer (74 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6.25%
SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol) was added to a final
concentration of 2.5× and samples were boiled for 5 min.
2.7.2. Western blotting
For SDS-PAGE, equal amounts of cellular protein, typically 10–20 µg
per lane, were used. All samples were separated using 10% Criterion XT
Precast Bis-Tris Gels (Biorad, Hercules, CA). Proteins were transferred
to nitrocellulose membranes and the quality of protein measurement,
electrophoresis and transfer checked by staining with Ponceau S.
Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in TBS-T (20 mM Tris
buffer pH 7.5, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature
and incubated overnight at 4 °C in the primary antibody diluted in 5%
BSA in TBS/0.05% Tween 20. The primary antibodies used were: HRP-
conjugated rabbit anti-actin (#5125, 1/20,000) from Cell Signaling

in TBS/0.1% Tween 20. After additional washing, protein bands were
detected by chemiluminescence using the Super Signal West Pico
Substrate (Pierce). For all antibodies, the same membrane was re-
probed for actin or an antiserum reacting with the total protein.

ples.

 3. Results
3.1. Phenotypic screening of plant extracts
We used a commercial plant extract library from Caithness
Biotechnologies (http://caithnessbiotechnologies.com/) as the starting
point for this study. This library was designed to maximize the potential
for hit finding against diverse molecular targets while minimizing the
content of potentially toxic compounds by focusing only on plants with
a history of use as traditional medicines or a history of inverse
association with disease risk. Moreover, this library has been carefully
sized to optimally balance high molecular diversity and potential for
lead finding by smaller research groups. Furthermore, the library con-
tains only extracts from plants that are commercially available thereby
negating any potential issues with recollection, sustainability or so-
vereignty of the discovery.
The library contains a total of 400 different plant extracts with two
pre-fractions per sample, one polar and one non-polar. For this study,
we focused on the non-polar extracts which were screened at a final
dilution of 1/10,000 in the oxytosis assay using HT22 hippocampal

basal and glutamate-induced ROS levels. Cells were treated with 5 mM glutamate alone or in the presence of the indicated concentrations of the compounds. After
7 h, ROS levels were determined using CM-H2DCFDA as described in Experimental Procedures. The treatments were done in sextuplicate and the results are the
average of 4 independent experiments. (E) Dose dependent effects of sterubin on HT22 cell survival in the presence of 5 µM tBOOH or 750 µM H2O2. Cell survival was
measured after 24 h with the MTT assay. (F) Iron binding of sterubin, eriodictyol and homoeridictyol. Iron (Fe+2) binding by the flavanones was measured using the
ferrozine assay at flavanone:iron ratios of 10:1, 5:1, 2:1 and 1:1. Results are presented as percent of Fe+2 chelated relative to controls with no flavonoid and are the
average of 3 independent experiments.

 nerve cells plated in 96 well plates [3]. Because of the generality of the
toxicity pathway in oxytosis and its mechanistic association with both
aging and AD, it is a good assay to quickly and simply screen the dif-
ferent extracts. Using this approach, we identified 9 extracts that pro-
vided significant protection from glutamate at the dilution used
(Table 1). Further analysis of these extracts for neurotrophic activity
(PC12 differentiation) and anti-inflammatory activity (BV2 cells) as
well as direct toxicity (Table 1) identified two extracts, C and G, that
not only were highly protective in the oxytosis assay but also had strong
anti-inflammatory and neurotrophic activity and showed < 10% cell
growth inhibition at the protective doses. Here we report our studies on
C whose source, Yerba santa (Eriodictyon californicum), is a shrub native
to California and thus of significant local interest.
3.2. HPLC fractionation and screening in the oxytosis assay
Given the complex composition of compounds in a crude extract, C
was fractionated by HPLC (Fig. 1A) and each fraction was then pre-
pared identically and tested at the same dilution in the oxytosis assay
(Fig. 1B). Fraction 17 was identified as the one that protected the most
with ~ 50% cell survival (Fig. 1B). No other fractions showed any
significant protection. Therefore, this fraction was selected for further
study.
3.3. Identification and purification of the flavonoid sterubin
In order to determine the composition of fraction 17 and possibly
identify individual biologically active compounds, the fraction was
analyzed by mass spectrometry. A strong peak was identified with a
molecular weight (MW) identical to two flavonoids known to be present
in Yerba santa, homoeriodictyol and sterubin (MW = 302) (Fig. 1C)
[23]. The mass fragmentation pattern was also determined to serve as a
fingerprint to identify the compound in the active fraction (Fig. 1D).
Homoeriodictyol and sterubin were obtained from commercial sources
and their HPLC elution times and mass fragmentation patterns de-
termined. While both characteristics of homoeriodictyol were distinct
from those of the active fraction, those of commercially sourced ster-
ubin (Fig. 1E) were almost identical strongly suggesting that the active
compound of this fraction was sterubin.
3.4. Validation of the biological activity of sterubin in screening assays
In order to determine whether the potent biological activity of C
could be explained by the presence of sterubin, the biological activity of
the purified compound was tested in all of the different screening assays
(Table 2). For comparison, the EC50 values for homoeriodictyol and
eriodictyol, two other flavonoids which are also present in Yerba santa
and have been much more widely studied, are also shown. In addition,

 the EC50 values for fisetin are included. Fisetin is a neuroprotective and
cognition-enhancing molecule which our laboratory has identified
using some of the same screening assays [14,24] and that we have re-
cently shown to protect in in vivo models of dementia and AD [25,26].
The results show that sterubin is indeed a highly effective compound in
all of the assays. In particular, sterubin is very effective at inhibiting
intracellular Abeta toxicity with an EC50 less than 1 µM. While erio-
dictyol has weaker but still significant activity in the same assays,
homoeriodictyol is completely inactive at concentrations up to 10 µM.
Importantly, the EC50 values of sterubin were substantially better than
those of fisetin.
3.5. Mechanisms underlying the beneficial activities of sterubin
The steps involved in oxytosis have been well characterized. The
first step involves the loss of the major endogenous intracellular anti-
oxidant glutathione (GSH). Thus, we first asked if sterubin could pre-
serve GSH levels. As shown in Fig. 2, sterubin dose-dependently in-
creased GSH levels in control cells (Fig. 2A, B) and maintained the
levels of GSH in cells treated with glutamate to induce oxytosis (Fig. 2A,
B). Eriodictyol was less effective at both increasing control GSH levels
and maintaining GSH in the presence of glutamate (Fig. 2B) while
homoeriodictyol was completely ineffective (Fig. 2B). Consistent with
the ability of sterubin to maintain GSH levels, it also provided excellent,
dose-dependent protection against two inducers of ferroptosis, a cell
death pathway closely related, if not identical, to oxytosis [7]. Erastin,
similar to glutamate, blocks system xc- activity while RSL3 is an in-
hibitor of glutathione peroxidase 4 that is downstream of GSH loss and
plays a key role in the cell death process in both oxytosis and ferroptosis
[7] (Fig. 2C).
Downstream of GSH loss in oxytosis is an increase in ROS levels. As
shown in Fig. 2D, sterubin strongly and dose-dependently reduced
glutamate-induced ROS production. Eriodictyol was less effective
(Fig. 2D) and homoeriodictyol had no effect (not shown). Interestingly,
sterubin also significantly reduced the basal levels of ROS (Fig. 2D)
prompting an examination of the effects of sterubin against two direct
pro-oxidants, H2O2 and t-butyl peroxide (tBOOH), both of which can
also promote cell death. As shown in Fig. 2E, sterubin was surprisingly
effective against cell death induced by either H2O2 or tBOOH with
EC50s of ~ 1 µM. These results prompted the measurement of the
sterubin's TEAC value which was quite low (Table 2) suggesting that it
is unlikely to act as a direct antioxidant.
Iron can promote cell death through its ability to generate ROS.
Since ferroptosis is described as an iron dependent form of cell death
[27] and iron chelators also protect from oxytosis [7], we next asked if
sterubin can chelate iron, which might contribute to its antioxidant
actions. To test its iron binding, we used the ferrozine assay [21] which
looks at the ability of a compound to prevent iron binding to ferrozine.
As shown in Fig. 2F, sterubin is quite an effective iron chelator even at
ratios of 1:1 flavonoid:iron. While eriodictyol showed similar activity,
homoeriodictyol demonstrated very little iron binding even at a ratio of
10:1 flavonoid:iron.
Two transcription factors contribute to the upregulation of GSH,
Nrf2 and ATF4 [5]. Thus, it was next asked if sterubin can alter the
levels of these proteins in the HT22 cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, sterubin
dose-dependently increased nuclear Nrf2 levels to a maximum of 6-fold
at 5 µM. This increase was seen within 30 min of sterubin treatment and
remained constant for up to 6 h (not shown). Eriodictyol also induced
Nrf2 with similar efficacy as sterubin (Fig. 3B). In contrast, homo-
eriodictyol had a much lesser effect on Nrf2 levels (not shown). Since
we have shown that ATF4 plays an important role in the maintenance of
GSH levels in nerve cells [28], we also examined the effects of the three
flavonoids on ATF4 levels using the same nuclear extracts. As shown in
Fig. 3C, sterubin dose-dependently increased nuclear ATF4 levels to a
maximum of 3-fold at 5 µM and eriodictyol had a similar effect. As with
Nrf2, the increase in nuclear ATF4 was seen within 30 min of treatment

 and remained constant for up to 6 h (not shown).
Nrf2 regulates the expression of multiple enzymes involved in GSH
metabolism and protection against oxidative stress [for review see
[29]]. Thus, we examined the levels of some of these proteins by
Western blotting. As observed in Fig. 3D, 10 µM sterubin increased the
levels of one of the glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) subunits (GCLM)
within 6 h of treatment (1.37-fold). In addition to GCLM, sterubin in-
creased the levels of p62 (22.7-fold) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) (4.1-
fold), two proteins involved in protection against oxidative stress and
known to be regulated by Nrf2 [30,31] with a similar time course
(Fig. 3D) further demonstrating that sterubin induces a variety of anti-
oxidant proteins.
Yerba santa has long been known for its anti-inflammatory prop-
erties [32] and in our phenotypic screens we found that sterubin had
potent anti-inflammatory activity in BV-2 microglial cells whereas
eriodictyol was less effective and homoeridodicytol had no effect at
concentrations up to 10 µM (Table 2). To expand upon this observation,
the BV-2 cells were treated with different doses of sterubin or erio-
dictyol in the presence of LPS and the production of NO, IL-6, IL-1β and
TNFα were determined on culture supernatants and the levels of iNOS
and COX2 assessed in cell extracts. Sterubin strongly and dose-depen-
dently reduced the production of NO, IL-6 and IL1β (Fig. 4A–C) as well
as the levels of both iNOS and COX2 (Fig. 5A, B). A lesser effect was
seen on the induction of TNFα (Fig. 4D). Eriodictyol was much less
effective (Fig. 4A–D) and homoeriodictyol, even at 5–10 µM, had little
or no effect on any of these parameters (not shown). Sterubin also dose-
dependently increased nuclear Nrf2 and ATF4 levels in the BV-2 cells
(Fig. 5C–E) suggesting that either or both of these transcription factors
might be a common target for both its neuroprotective and anti-in-
flammatory effects.
To test this idea, we first downregulated Nrf2 in the HT22 nerve
cells and the BV-2 microglia using specific siRNA. In the HT22 cells, the
Nrf2 levels were decreased by ~ 90% (Fig. 6A) while in the BV-2 cells
the Nrf2 levels were decreased by ~ 80% (Fig. 7A). In the HT22 nerve
cells, knockdown of Nrf2 significantly shifted the dose-response curve
for neuroprotection by sterubin in the oxytosis assay (Fig. 6B). In
contrast, Nrf2 knockdown had little or no effect on the protective ef-
fects of sterubin against H2O2 or tBOOH (Fig. 6B, C) suggesting that
these actions were mediated by as yet unidentified pathways. In the BV-
2 cells, the effects of Nrf2 knockdown were much more dramatic with
the EC50s for inhibition of NO, IL-6 and IL-1β production shifted from
1–2 µM to greater than 10 µM (Fig. 7B–D). Thus, Nrf2 appears to play a
key role in the anti-inflammatory effects of sterubin and contribute to
its neuroprotective activity in the HT22 cells.
Since sterubin also induces ATF4 (Fig. 3), we looked at the effects of
ATF4 knockdown on the activities of sterubin in both BV2 microglia
and HT22 nerve cells. In contrast to the results with Nrf2 knockdown,
loss of ATF4 by 80–85% in the HT22 cells (Fig. 6A) had little or no
effect on neuroprotection against glutamate (Fig. 6) and actually en-
hanced the neuroprotective effects of sterubin against H2O2 or tBOOH
(Fig. 6B, C). These results further support the idea that these actions by
sterubin are mediated by pathways distinct from those involving ATF4
or Nrf2. Similarly, loss of ATF4 by ~ 80% (Fig. 7A) had no effect on the
anti-inflammatory activity of sterubin (Fig. 7B–D).

 4. Discussion
In this manuscript, we show for the first time that the most sig-
nificant neuroprotective flavonoid in Yerba santa is the flavanone
sterubin. Although sterubin has long been known to be present in Yerba
santa [23], it has remained remarkably unstudied with most reports
focusing on the other Yerba santa flavonoids, eriodictyol or homo-
eriodicytol. Moreover, studies which have identified sterubin in various
screens have often ignored it based on the incorrect assumption that it
was already well studied [eg 33]. While eriodictyol has some of the
same properties as sterubin, albeit with significantly higher EC50s,
homoeriodictyol is essentially inactive in most of our assays at con-
centrations up to 10 µM.
Yerba santa has long been known to have medicinal properties. For
example, a treatise published in 1902 on plants used by the native
people in Mendocino County, California [34] states that “No plant is
more highly valued as a medicine by all the tribes of Mendocino
County.” Historically, it was used to treat a variety of indications in-
cluding various respiratory conditions and fever as well as bruises, in-
fections and pain including headaches [32,34]. Thus, its anti-in-
flammatory properties are well documented, consistent with the potent
anti-inflammatory effects of sterubin in our in vitro assay.
Although sterubin has not previously been studied in the context of
neuroprotection, there are a number of reports on eriodictyol. However,
consistent with our results, eriodictyol was previously shown not to be
effective either against oxytosis in HT22 cells or LPS-induced nitrite
production in BV-2 microglial cells [35]. Nevertheless, other studies
have found that eriodictyol could reduce both oxidative stress and in-
flammation in both cell culture and animal models [36–39]. The in vitro
neuroprotective effects were at least partially dependent on Nrf2
[36,37] but required relatively high concentrations of the flavonoid
(> 20 µM). This is in contrast to the strong effects seen in this study
with sterubin even at 1–2 µM. Although it has recently been reported
that homoeriodictyol can also induce Nrf2 and protect against oxidative
stress in endothelial cells [40], we did not observe a similar effect in the
HT22 or BV-2 cells.
Previously, we showed that the flavonol fisetin could upregulate
both Nrf2 and ATF4 [41] and, at the time, this appeared to be the first
molecule described which could do so. As shown in this manuscript,
sterubin, as well as eriodictyol, exhibit a similar property. However, in
contrast to fisetin [41], Nrf2 rather than ATF4 plays a role in the
neuroprotective effects of sterubin. Nrf2 is also critical to the anti-in-
flammatory actions of sterubin. Nrf2 has long been known to have both
cytoprotective [31] and anti-inflammatory activity [42]. The cytopro-
tective activity is related to its ability to simultaneously upregulate the
transcription of genes encoding a variety of antioxidant and detox-
ification proteins including those that regulate intracellular GSH
homeostasis, major components of the thioredoxin system which
modulates protein oxidation, and proteins involved in heme and iron
metabolism. A number of these proteins, such as HO-1, also contribute
to the anti-inflammatory effects of Nrf2 [42]. Nrf2 can also directly
suppress the transcription of some pro-inflammatory cytokines in-
cluding IL-6 and IL-1β [43] consistent with our data in the BV-2 cells.
In addition, we show that sterubin is an effective iron chelator.
Since iron can contribute to nerve cell damage in aging and neurode-
generative diseases [8], this property is likely to contribute to the
neuroprotective activity of sterubin both in vitro and potentially in vivo.
Importantly, we recently showed that iron can potentiate GSH loss and
cell death [20] in response to compounds that promote GSH loss but not
in response to other oxidants. This finding might help to explain at least

 some of the protective activity of sterubin that is not dependent on Nrf2
in the glutamate-treated HT22 cells.
We also show that sterubin is effective against multiple inducers of
cell death that activate distinct cell death pathways. Importantly, not
only is sterubin very effective against oxytosis induced by glutamate
treatment but also against inducers of the very closely related ferrop-
totic pathway [7] including erastin which has the same target as glu-
tamate and RSL3 which inhibits glutathione peroxidase 4, a down-
stream target of this pathway [7]. This finding indicates that not only
does sterubin protect against oxytosis/ferroptosis by maintaining GSH
levels under conditions of stress but it also acts downstream of GSH
loss. In addition, sterubin prevents cell death induced by both H2O2 and
tBOOH, although in contrast to the protection against oxytosis, Nrf2
does not seem to be involved in sterubin-mediated protection against
these two agents. This protection may involve the iron chelating ac-
tivity of sterubin as iron chelators can protect against H2O2 and tBOOH
toxicity (not shown). Importantly, sterubin is also very effective at
protecting the MC65 nerve cells against the toxic accumulation of in-
tracellular amyloid beta peptide which is considered by many to be a
primary toxic event in AD [17].
An important property that distinguishes sterubin from either
eriodictyol or homoeriodictyol is its ability to induce PC12 cell differ-
entiation (Table 2). We [3] and others [44] have suggested that the
ability to activate neurotrophic signaling pathways is an important
characteristic of potential neuroprotective compounds. Indeed, treat-
ments that only activate anti-oxidant systems may not be adequate to
address the numerous changes that occur in the aging brain and that are
exacerbated in AD. Thus, a compound such as sterubin that not only
activates global anti-oxidant systems via Nrf2 but also mimics neuro-
trophic signaling may be particularly effective for the treatment of
neurodegenerative diseases.
By combining the analyses of the neuroprotective activities of
sterubin, eriodictyol, homoeriodictyol, and fisetin in our phenotypic
screening assays (Table 2) with their physicochemical properties
(Table 3), we were able to elaborate a plausible structure-activity re-
lationship (SAR). The catechol B-ring with phenolic hydroxyls on
sterubin is essential for its neuroprotective activities. Comparing their
chemical structures, sterubin, eriodictyol, and fisetin contain a 3′,4′-
dihydroxy on the catechol B-ring and they are all active in our cell-
based assays with EC50 values less than 5 µM. In contrast, homo-
eriodictyol, which contains a 3′-methoxy 4′-hydroxy on the B-ring, is
inactive (EC50s > 10 µM). For flavonoids, free phenolic hydroxyl
groups on the catechol ring provide hydrogen bonds important for
molecular recognition. They are key structural features known to be
responsible for the radical scavenging, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory
and anti-protein aggregation activities [45,46]. Because our phenotypic
screens in cell culture models mimic several aspects of the changes seen
in the aging brain including increases in oxidative stress, energy loss,
neuroinflammation, and intracellular Aβ aggregation, it is logical that
we identified sterubin, eriodictyol, and fisetin as being active in these
assays. Interestingly, sterubin has a relatively low TEAC value sup-
porting the idea that it protects from oxidative stress-induced death via
an indirect anti-oxidant mechanism. In addition, the ortho-dihydroxyls
on the B-ring play a role in chelation of oxidizing metal ions [45]. This
was confirmed in the present study which showed that sterubin and
eriodictyol effectively bind Fe2+ in a dose-dependent manner while

 homoeriodictyol does not (Fig. 2F). On the other hand, the hydroxyl
groups in the A-ring of sterubin are not critical for the neuroprotection
but could play a modulating role. Sterubin is a derivative of eriodictyol
where the only difference is the 7-methoxy group on the A-ring of
sterubin. Such O-methylation on the A-ring increases the overall lipo-
philicity of sterubin (ClogP, 2.37) compared to eriodictyol (ClogP,
1.85). It also decreases the total polar surface area (tPSA) from 107 to
96 Å and reduces the number of hydrogen bond donors (HBD) to 3
(Table 3). It is conceivable that such changes in its physiochemical
properties increase, at least in part, the passive membrane permeability
of sterubin for better target engagement in cells, which in turn con-
tributes to the approximately 3-fold increase of neuroprotective po-
tency in comparison with eriodictyol (Table 2). In addition, methyla-
tion of flavonoids has been reported to improve their bioavailability
and metabolic stability [47].
Sterubin is also about 4-fold more potent in the phenotypic
screening assays than fisetin, an AD drug candidate [25,26]. Despite
their structural differences in the A- and C-rings, sterubin has a higher
ClogP, a smaller tPSA, and one less HBD compared to fisetin. Again, in
support of our hypothesis, this may result in sterubin being more cell
membrane permeable and thereby more potent than fisetin. Touil et al.
[48] previously reported that geraldol, a 3′-O-methylated derivative of
fisetin, is an active metabolite in mice and shows a higher potency of
cytotoxic and antiangiogenic activities in vitro. Although those com-
pounds were tested for anticancer rather than neuroprotective activ-
ities, this provides additional evidence that methylation of flavonoids
can modulate their physiochemical properties and potency and the
methylation position may play a distinct roles in modulating different
biochemical. Strikingly, sterubin meets the desirable physicochemical
criteria to be a viable CNS drug candidate (Table 3), and it has a higher
score of CNS druglikeness than fisetin [49]. However, it will be im-
portant to investigate the sterubin metabolites and pharmacokinetics in
vivo in order to provide a better understanding of the pharmacological
behavior of sterubin.
Finally, one of the known properties of sterubin that overlaps with
those of eriodictyol and homoeriodictyol is its bitter masking property
[23]. Studies have shown that all three flavonoids are antagonists of
bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) [50]. While bitter receptors are best known
and studied for their role in taste, recent studies have shown that these
receptors are also located in multiple regions of the brain [51] where
their roles are presently unknown. However, there is evidence for the
upregulation of some of these receptors in AD as well as other neuro-
degenerative diseases [52]. Thus, a compound such as sterubin which
can act as a T2R receptor antagonist might have additional, and as yet

 undescribed, beneficial effects in vivo.
Together these studies provide further support for the use of our set
of phenotypic screening assays to identify more potent neuroprotective
molecules. In this report, we used a curated library of plant extracts and
found that 9/400 (2.25%) extracts were highly active. Using the oxy-
tosis assay as our primary screen, we identified extracts that are ex-
tremely effective against a form of cell death that is associated with a
variety of age-associated diseases including AD [7]. The subsequent
identification of sterubin in one of the most active extracts shows that
even compounds which are generally thought of as well studied [33]
can provide surprising results. Thus, based on its potent Nrf2-inducing
as well as neurotrophic, anti-inflammatory and iron chelating proper-
ties, we believe that sterubin deserves further examination in the con-
text of AD, as well as other neurodegenerative diseases.
