Abstract
Background: Placebo effects contribute substantially to outcome in most fields of medicine. While clinical trials
typically try to control or minimize these effects, the potential of placebo mechanisms to improve outcome is rarely
used. Patient expectations about treatment efficacy and outcome are major mechanisms that contribute to these
placebo effects. We aimed to optimize these expectations to improve outcome in patients undergoing coronary
artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
Methods: In a prospective three-arm randomized clinical trial with a 6 month follow-up, 124 patients scheduled for
CABG surgery were randomized to either a brief psychological pre-surgery intervention to optimize outcome
expectations (EXPECT); or a psychological control intervention focusing on emotional support and general advice,
but not on expectations (SUPPORT); or to standard medical care (SMC). Interventions were kept brief to be feasible
with a heart surgery environment; “dose” of therapy was identical for both pre-surgery interventions. Primary
outcome was disability 6 months after surgery. Secondary outcomes comprised further clinical and immunological
variables.
Results: Patients in the EXPECT group showed significantly larger improvements in disability (−12.6; −17.6 to −7.5)
than the SMC group (−1.9; −6.6 to +2.7); patients in the SUPPORT group (−6.7; −11.8 to 1.7) did not differ from the
SMC group. Comparing follow-up scores and controlling for baseline scores of EXPECT versus SUPPORT on the
variable disability only revealed a trend in favor of the EXPECT group (P = 0.09). Specific advantages for EXPECT
compared to SUPPORT were found for mental quality of life and fitness for work (hours per week). Both
psychological pre-surgery interventions induced less pronounced increases in pro-inflammatory cytokine
concentrations reflected by decreased interleukin-8 levels post-surgery compared to changes in SMC patients
and lower interleukin-6 levels in patients of the EXPECT group at follow-up. Both pre-surgery interventions were
characterized by great patient acceptability and no adverse effects were attributed to them. Considering the
innovative nature of this approach, replication in larger, multicenter trials is needed.
Conclusions: Optimizing patients’ expectations pre-surgery helps to improve outcome 6 months after treatment.
This implies that making use of placebo mechanisms has the potential to improve long-term outcome of highly
invasive medical interventions. Further studies are warranted to generalize this approach to other fields of medicine.
Trial registration: Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the IRB of the Medical School, University of
Marburg, and the trial was registered at (NCT01407055) on July 25, 2011.

 Background
Placebo mechanisms contribute substantially to clinical
treatments in various fields of medicine, but systematic
approaches to utilize these mechanisms for improved
outcome are scarce [1, 2]. While placebo effects are
substantial for patient-reported outcomes such as pain
or depression, placebo effects can be also demonstrated for
objective parameters such as immune responses, cardiovas-
cular parameters, dopamine release, electroencephalogram
and functional magnetic resonance imaging parameters [3].
Major determinants of placebo mechanisms are patient
pre-treatment expectations about treatment effects; experi-
mental manipulations of volunteer expectations can either
amplify or abolish the pain-reducing effects of potent
opioids such as remifentanil [4]. Labeling of treatments
substantially determines treatment effects [5]. Therefore,
optimizing patient expectations could offer options to im-
prove treatment outcome.
Patient expectations are also associated with favorable
outcome of surgical interventions [6–8]. If patients
undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG)
expected to remain disabled after the surgery, it is more
likely that these patients would still suffer from substantial
disability post-surgery, even if their surgeons predicted
a good patient recovery [9–11]. However, such patient
expectations are naturally occurring expectations, and
not systematically induced expectations during clinical
encounters. Considering the close association between
pre-treatment expectations and disability following sur-
gery, the question arises whether optimizing patient
preoperative expectations can improve outcome following
highly invasive interventions such as CABG. Here, we re-
port on the long-term effects (6 months) of a randomized
controlled trial investigating PSYchological preoperative
interventions to improve outcome in HEART surgery pa-
tients (PSY-HEART trial).
In cardiac surgery, psychological preoperative interven-
tions have been shown to change general risk factors and
cardiac misconceptions, to improve knowledge about their
surgery, and to increase physical activity [12–14]. How-
ever, the results of current preoperative interventions on
outcome variables in CABG remain inconclusive [15].
Notably, none of these preoperative interventions directly
targeted patient expectations as the most prominent pla-
cebo mechanism.
The integration of psychological preparations into the
cardiac surgery unit environment requires a brief format.
Therefore, we developed a short psychological pre-surgery
intervention to optimize patient outcome expectations.
We hypothesized that optimizing patient expectations im-
proves outcome in CABG patients, especially in terms of
disability as the primary outcome, but also in terms of
general quality of life, subjective fitness for work, physical
activity levels, and emotional outcomes. As a potential
biological marker of the recovery process, we also assessed
immune parameters. To evaluate the specificity of such an
intervention, we included another psychological compari-
son condition offering emotional support and behavioral
advice, with a similar “dose” as the expectation group.
Both interventions were compared to standard medical
care (SMC).
Methods
Study design
This is a longitudinal three arm, randomized clinical trial,
investigating the effect of different pre-surgery interven-
tions on 6 months follow-up assessments in patients
undergoing heart surgery (see CONSORT flow chart Fig. 1;
full description of study design see [16]). We hypothesized
that optimizing patient outcome expectations improves
long-term outcome even after highly invasive interven-
tions such as heart surgery. After study inclusion, patients
were either randomized to an expectation optimization
group (EXPECT), or to an emotional support group
(SUPPORT), or to SMC preparation for the surgery (for
short descriptions of interventions, see below). Clinical
outcomes are compared between baseline and 6 months
follow-up; immune parameters are also reported for direct
surgery-associated changes (see below).
Participant enrollment
The study took place at the Department of Cardiovascular
Surgery, Heart Center, in collaboration with the Division
of Clinical Psychology, Philipps University Marburg. Pa-
tients on the waiting list of the Heart Surgery Center were
contacted before hospital admission. Inclusion criteria
were adults older than 18 years who were scheduled for
elective on pump CABG or CABG combined with valve
surgery. Further inclusion criteria were ability to give in-
formed consent and sufficient fluency in German. The in-
terventions were introduced as two additional, slightly
different brief psychological interventions, both aimed at
improving coping with CABG. Exclusion criteria were the
presence of a serious comorbid non-cardiac medical con-
dition or psychiatric condition that substantially affected
disability. Current psychiatric condition was assessed with
the standardized interview structured clinical interview for
DSM-IV diagnoses [17]. All participants gave written in-
formed consent. Data collection lasted from April 2011 to
May 2015.
Out of 249 patients approached for participation, 72
(28.9%) declined because of motivational reasons, including
travel problems to attend the study appointments. Patients
who agreed to take part in the study were significantly
younger (t(157) = 3.31; P = 0.001), while sex ratios were
comparable to patients who declined [18]. Two patients
died before admission to the hospital, while 24 patients did

 not fulfill the inclusion criteria (Fig. 1). Thus, we started
with an ITT sample of 124 patients (87% only CABG; 13%
CABG plus heart valve replacement). Follow-up assess-
ments were completed by 108 patients at 6 months follow-
up (88.5% of baseline sample; 87% of ITT sample). Seven
patients died post-surgery (two in SMC, two in SUPPORT,
three in EXPECT condition).
While the study design was not changed from protocol,
sample size calculation had to be adapted from initial cal-
culations due to slower than anticipated recruitment into
the trial. The sample size was adjusted to 124, thereby en-
suring that this is still able to detect at least moderate ef-
fects (Cohen’s d > 0.30; alpha = 0.05; clinically meaningful
difference in pain disability index > 4) with a power of
85%. Considering the Helsinki recommendation that trials
investigating innovative interventions should not be over-
sized, this was considered acceptable.
Outcome variables
The predefined primary outcome variable according to
the study protocol [16] was disability 6 months after sur-
gery. We used a modified version of the Pain Disability
Index, which was adapted for cardiology patients. This
scale assesses disability in seven areas of life (family, job,
social activities, etc.; ratings from 0 to 10) caused by the
major health problem. It offers the opportunity to com-
pare ratings with general population data [19], and re-
sults in a disability total score.
Secondary outcome variables addressed quality of life
(QoL), fitness for work, physical activity, cardiac anxiety,
and mental health. Health-related QoL was assessed by
the Short Form Health Survey which has two subscales
of QoL, namely physical and mental QoL [20]. Fitness
for work was assessed asking patients the amount of time
they feel able to work per week (in hours). We also assessed

data analyses

 physical activity with the International Physical Activity
Questionnaire (IPAQ), which allows the computation of
metabolic equivalents of physical exercise [21]. Depression
and anxiety were assessed by Hospital Anxiety and Depres-
sion Scale [22]. We also assessed cardiac specific anxiety
using the Cardiac Anxiety Questionnaire [23]. This scale
asks for concerns associated with the experience of cardiac
sensations (e.g., after palpitations). Medical outcome
variables such as readmission rates, adverse cardiac events
after CABG, and acceptability of psychological interven-
tions were also evaluated.
As a manipulation check measure, patient expectations
about outcome and personal control beliefs were assessed
using subscales of the Expected Illness Perception Ques-
tionnaire, which is based upon the Illness Perception
Questionnaire [24]. This scale assesses patient expecta-
tions about their illness 6 months after surgery. Outcome
expectations were assessed by the three items from the
“treatment control subscale”, such as “6 months after
CABG surgery, the surgery has cured my coronary dis-
ease”. Expected personal control beliefs were assessed by
the four items from the Expected Illness Perception Ques-
tionnaire “personal control subscale”, such as “6 months
after CABG surgery, there is a lot I can do myself to
control my symptoms”.
As biological markers of the recovery process, immune
parameters (interleukin 6 and 8 (IL-6, IL-8), tumor ne-
crosis factor TNF-alpha, C-reactive protein (CRP)) were
analyzed from blood samples. They were obtained at
baseline, pre-surgery, 6–8 days post-surgery, and at
follow-up, standardized at 2:00 PM to control for diurnal
variations. Plasma for CRP and cytokine measurements
was separated by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C until
analysis. Plasma levels were analyzed by flow cytometry
using bead-based assays (Bio-Plex Pro Human Cytokine
Assays, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA).
Medical status
Medical status was either assessed directly by physicians
of the university hospital, or gathered from the patients’
medical records. It included the New York Heart Associ-
ation Classification, EuroSCORE II (European System for
Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation [25]), left ventricular
ejection fraction (LVEF), comorbid medical conditions,
body mass index, smoking status, and history of myocar-
dial infarction.
Procedure
The first assessment took place 1 week before surgery,
either at home or in the university department. This was
followed by the first in-person session of the psycho-
logical intervention, two phone calls, admission to the
hospital, and second in-person session with subsequent
assessments of psychological variables, on the day before
surgery. Follow-up assessments took place 6 months
after surgery. Further characteristics of the study sample
can be found in Table 1. Further details of the study de-
sign are reported elsewhere [16].
Assignment to treatment arms followed a stratified
permuted block randomization procedure with a block
size of 9. Stratification criteria were age (above or below
65 years) and New York Heart Association class (1,2 ver-
sus 3,4) to control for differences in cardiac status. Ran-
dom procedure was defined using an internet program
(WINPEPI) before first-patient-in by JL, enrollment of
patients was initiated by a study nurse being blind with
regards to treatment condition. Allocation concealment
was verified using closed envelopes including group allo-
cation information that were handed over to the therapist
after inclusion of a new patient. Surgeons, hospital staff in-
volved in patient care, and staff assessing treatment effects
were blind to treatment condition.
Interventions
EXPECT and SUPPORT both encompassed the same
amount of personal contact (two 50 min individual ses-
sions pre-surgery, two 20 min phone calls pre-surgery,
one 20 min booster phone call post-surgery). Treatment
sessions were audiotaped to verify treatment adherence.
The brief and focused format of the interventions was
shown to be feasible in the cardiac surgery environment.
EXPECT (expectation manipulation intervention): This
intervention focused on the development of realistic ex-
pectations about the benefits of surgery and the recovery
process. Patients were encouraged to develop personal
ideas and images about their future after surgery, includ-
ing plans about activities and how they will enjoy their life
afterwards (outcome expectations). Personally relevant
steps and plans for the 6 months after surgery were re-
corded for patients. Additionally, patients received a book-
let containing all relevant session information, including
the work sheets and audio-CDs of their sessions. Finally,
normal symptoms after surgery that could be expected
were discussed, and differentiated from unlikely complica-
tions. Patient control expectations were enhanced by dis-
cussing ways in which they could manage unpleasant
symptoms or sensations, and how they could positively in-
fluence the disease course after surgery.
An example may further illustrate this intervention.
Many patients hoped to again be able to work in their
garden after surgery. In the EXPECT intervention, these
patients developed specific plans on how they would
successfully be able to reassume gardening activities due
to their expected increased exercise capacity following
surgery: repotting small plants in the early stage, lawn
mowing after some time, increasing to more demanding
gardening tasks between 3–6 months after surgery. One

 patient imagined himself chopping wood in preparation
for hosting a barbecue in his garden for his family.
SUPPORT: This attention control group received the
same amount of therapist attention, but without targeting
expectations. Therapists encouraged expressing emotions
and anxieties about the anticipated surgery, and therapists
used reflective listening techniques and expressed em-
pathy. This therapy has been developed to include all
so-called “common factors of psychotherapy”, such as
empathy, therapist attention, and verbalization of emo-
tions [26]. Patients in the SUPPORT group did not receive
audio-CDs.
SMC: Like the patients of the other groups, these pa-
tients received the standardized informed consent pro-
cedure before surgery, and general medical care, but no
additional psychological interventions. Assessments were
identical.
Therapists: Pre-surgery interventions were provided by
three psychologists (2 male, 1 female). All therapists were
specifically trained and provided both types of interven-
tions; they were additionally supervised by a senior psycho-
therapist to ensure treatment fidelity. Previous analyses
confirmed treatment fidelity, and treatment satisfaction was
similar between the two intervention groups [18].

 Statistics
The primary hypotheses (better follow-up outcome in
the EXPECT group) were analyzed using a linear mixed
model with time, treatment group and time × treatment
group interaction as fixed effects and a random intercept
for subject specific effects with maximum likelihood es-
timation and autoregressive residual matrix. Compared
to intention-to-treat analyses, this procedure provides
better estimates for missing data using the full data sam-
ple (intention-to-treat sample), and addresses individual
differences more adequately [27, 28]. Pattern of missing
values is postulated to be random. We expected a sig-
nificant interaction between intervention group and as-
sessment time. Requirements of this procedure for data
distribution were inspected according the Field’s recom-
mendations [29]. If criteria for multivariate outliers were
fulfilled (1 to 3 persons per group; Mahalanobis-distance
criteria), preconditions for maximum likelihood estima-
tions were violated, and data were not included. If sig-
nificant interactions occurred, we report pre–post tests
per group to indicate whether the specific group has im-
proved, and we compared follow-up scores of pairwise
groups controlling for baseline scores (two groups, two
assessment points).
For immunological parameters, preconditions for mul-
tilinear analyses were checked, and log-transformation
was used if data was extremely skewed and could not be
used for calculating linear mixed models (this was the
case for IL-6). Boxplots were used to check for outliers.
Values greater/lower than three interquartile ranges
from the upper/lower quartile were considered as miss-
ing values. This was the case for less than 5.4%.
All statistical analyses were run using SPSS Statistics 22.
Tables report observed means for all variables, figures
report estimated marginal means for selected variables
to illustrate effects.
Results
Baseline characteristics
Despite large comparability of baseline variables (Table 1),
we found differences for LVEF, with more favorable scores
in the EXPECT group. While we continued to analyze the
data as planned, we also repeated the central statistical
analyses out-of-protocol adjusting for LVEF as covariate
[30]; however, significant findings of group × assessment
point, e.g., for disability, QoL, and physical activity were
replicated.
Manipulation check
Specific effects of our expectation manipulation on pa-
tient beliefs about their ability to have some control over
the course of the illness and recovery were confirmed by
a significant interaction between time × treatment group.
Patient expectations to personally control the disease
were significantly higher after the psychological inter-
vention (simple effects per group compared to baseline)
for EXPECT (from 14.03 to 16.06; P < 0.001), but not for
SUPPORT (from 15.24 to 14.91; P = 0.409) or SMC
(from 15.28 to 15.16, P = 0.743; Fig. 2a).
Primary outcome: disability at 6 months
For our primary outcome disability, a better outcome in
the EXPECT group was found, indicated by a significant
group × time interaction. Improvements in disability were
significantly larger in the EXPECT (−12.6; −17.6 to −7.5)
compared to the SMC group (−1.9; −6.6 to +2.7), with
intermediate effects in the SUPPORT group (−6.7; −11.8
to 1.7). The decrease in disability between baseline and
follow-up was significant in the EXPECT (simple time
effects per group P < 0.001) and in the SUPPORT group
(P = 0.01), but not in the SMC group (P = 0.404) (Fig. 2b).
Further post hoc tests used two-group comparisons, con-
trolling for corresponding baseline scores (two groups,
two assessment points). The significant advantage of
EXPECT over SMC was confirmed (interaction with
two groups as post hoc test; F(1, 70.442) = 9.562, P =
0.003), while the SUPPORT group did not report sig-
nificantly lower disability scores than the SMC group
(F(1, 71.578) = 1.781, P = 0.186). Comparing the two
groups with psychological preoperative interventions, we
found a trend in favor of the EXPECT group compared to
the SUPPORT group (interaction of the two groups with
assessment time F(1, 62.571) = 2.872, P = 0.095), which
failed to reach significance. Additional file 1: Figure S4
shows individual courses of improvement in disability
scores between the three intervention groups.
To test a possible mediation of expectation changes
for our primary outcome, we repeated the main analysis
on disability, once with personal control expectations at
baseline as covariate, second with personal control expec-
tations after the psychological interventions as covariate.
Adding the baseline variable “control expectation” as a co-
variate further sharpens the significant group × time inter-
action for disability (F = 5.4; P = 0.006), without showing
any significant effect for the covariate (F = 0.15; ns).
Including “control expectation after the psychological
interventions” shows more potential as a mediator and
leads to the non-significance of the group × time inter-
action (F = 2.14; P = 0.12), but the covariate still fails
to contribute significantly (F = 2.08; P = 0.15).
Secondary outcomes
The better outcome for the EXPECT group was further
confirmed by QoL data as assessed by the Short-Form
Health Survey. For mental QoL, a significant time ×
treatment group interaction indicated that mental QoL
increased for patients in the EXPECT group at follow-up
compared to baseline (P < 0.001), but not for patients’

 receiving SUPPORT (P = 0.748) or SMC (P = 0.329). Post
hoc tests revealed significant advantages for the EXPECT
group compared to SMC (F = 5.9; P = 0.018), but also com-
pared to SUPPORT (F = 7.3; P = 0.009), while the SUP-
PORT group was similar to SMC (F = 0.2; non-significant).
For physical QoL, both psychological intervention groups
reported better outcome than the SMC group, indicated by
an overall group × assessment interaction, and significant
improvements in both psychological intervention groups
(Table 2). Post hoc tests revealed significant advantages of
EXPECT versus SMC (F = 6.3; P = 0.015), while the other
comparisons of two groups were non-significant (SUP-
PORT vs. SMC F = 3.1, P = 0.081; EXPECT vs. SUPPORT
F = 0.3, non-significant).
A significant advantage of the EXPECT group was also
found for subjective ability to work at follow-up (Table 2).
Only patients of the EXPECT group reported significantly
more hours of working ability, compared to SMC. The in-
crease of metabolic equivalents of physical activity after
surgery at follow-up was significantly different between
groups (IPAQ), with significant increases of physical ac-
tivity in both intervention groups (EXPECT: P <0.001;
SUPPORT: P < 0.001), but not in the SMC group (P =
0.673). Repeated measure analyses of pairs of two groups
comparing follow-up scores and controlling for baseline
scores confirmed more improvement in the psychological
intervention groups versus SMC (EXPECT vs. SMC F =
5.87, P = 0.019; SUPPORT vs. SMC F = 10.17, P = 0.002),
while the two pre-surgery intervention groups did not dif-
fer (EXPECT vs. SUPPORT F = 0.14; non-significant).

indicated that improvements were highly significant in

For significant group × time interactions follow-up tests were calculated. ‘Significant pre–post comparisons’ (last column) means that the baseline value was significantly different from the post value for the groups
stated in this column (e.g., ‘B, C’ would indicate that for SUPPORT and EXPECT the baseline values were significantly different from the post values within both groups, but for SMC baseline and post values did not
differ significantly). For variables only reported at follow-up (e.g., working ability) and for biological variables (four assessment points), the letters indicate significant group differences at the indicated time point.
(e.g. ‘Follow-up: AC’ would indicate that groups SMC and EXPECT have significantly different scores at follow-up)
aBecause this variable was only assessed at follow-up, the column “test statistics” includes group comparison (three groups), while the column “pre–post comparison” includes pairwise comparisons

 the EXPECT (P < 0.001) and the SUPPORT group (P < 0.01),
but not after SMC. Accordingly, repeated measure ana-
lyses of pairs of two groups comparing follow-up scores
and controlling for baseline scores confirmed improve-
ments of EXPECT and SUPPORT versus SMC (EXPECT
vs. SMC F = 6.78, P = 0.011; SUPPORT vs. SMC F = 4.25;
P = 0.043; EXPECT vs. SUPPORT F = 0.36; non-significant).
For depression, significant decreases between admission
and follow-up indicated general improvements on this vari-
able, but no group specific changes (main effect for time:
F(3, 220.6) = 17.3; P < 0.001). A similar pattern was found
for general anxiety (main effect for time: F(3, 207.7) = 11.6;
P < 0.001).
Immune parameters
A significant change in immune response after surgery
was confirmed for pro-inflammatory cytokines and
CRP (Table 2; main effects for assessment time IL-6 F(3,
218.319) = 198.192, P < 0.001; IL-8 F(3, 208.965) = 93.369,
P < 0.001; TNF-α F(3, 174.603) = 54.807, P < 0.001; CRP
F(3, 208.298) = 911.370, P < 0.001). Significant interactions
between group and assessment time were caused by de-
creased post-surgery IL-8 levels (Fig. 3b). Pairwise com-
parisons per assessment point revealed only significant
group differences after surgery – both groups with psy-
chological interventions had lower scores than patients in
the SMC group (EXPECT P = 0.028; SUPPORT P = 0.01),
with no significant difference between EXPECT and SUP-
PORT (P > 0.20). In addition, patients in the EXPECT
group had lower (log-transformed) IL-6 concentrations at
follow-up (Fig. 3a). Pairwise comparisons per assessment
point revealed one significant finding, namely that EX-
PECT patients had significantly lower log-IL-6 scores than
SMC patients at follow-up (P = 0.006).
Medical outcomes, adverse events
LVEF scores at baseline are reported in Table 1 (n = 105),
LVEF scores at follow-up are reported in Table 2 (n = 81).
Most patients achieved satisfactory LVEF scores (>50%) at
follow-up, with some advantages in the EXPECT group
(100% of patients) compared to the SUPPORT (88.5%)
and SMC (80.6%) groups. These differences were signifi-
cant on a trend level (χ2 (2) = 5.138; P = 0.077); consider-
ing cell sizes and baseline differences, this will not be
further interpreted. Although rehospitalization scores after
surgery were lowest in the EXPECT group (9% vs. 23% in
the SUPPORT and 26% in the SMC group), this difference
failed to achieve statistical significance (χ2 (2) = 3.380;
P = 0.185; Table 2). The groups did not differ substantially
in terms of medication intake or adverse cardiac events
after CABG or during follow-up (Additional file 1).
Acceptability and satisfaction with the psychological
interventions was very high without reporting of any
negative effects (details see [18]).
Discussion
Our general research question was whether placebo
mechanisms, such as patient expectations, can be uti-
lized to improve outcome in invasive medical interven-
tions such as CABG. We developed a brief psychological
intervention that can be carried out in a cardiac surgery
environment, and which focuses on the optimization of
patients’ expectations about course and outcome after
cardiac surgery. Patients who received the expectation-
oriented intervention (EXPECT) reported lower disabil-
ity and improved QoL 6 months after surgery. This re-
sult is further underlined by patient ratings about their
fitness for work – patients receiving this intervention re-
ported to be able to work significantly more hours per
week than patients receiving SMC or a psychological
control intervention (SUPPORT). The fact that recovery
was significantly improved in the EXPECT group under-
pins the relevance of specifically targeting patient expecta-
tions beyond employing general therapeutic techniques
such as an empathic and supportive relationship.
While the SUPPORT group did not achieve the same
positive results as the EXPECT group, their outcome
was still better than in the SMC group for some (e.g.,
physical activity, cardiac anxiety), but not all variables
(no significant advantage in disability, working ability,
QoL, depression, or anxiety). We introduced the SUPPORT
group as an “attention control group” to the EXPECT
group. However, empathic interactions and a positive thera-
peutic relationship are also considered to be effective pla-
cebo mechanisms, and they can substantially enhance
treatment efficacy, while reducing risks for negative events
[31–33]. Therefore, the SUPPORT group covers the pla-
cebo mechanism of empathy, while the EXPECT group
covers both empathy and expectation modification. Similar
improvements in cardiac anxiety between SUPPORT and
EXPECT group could indicate that SUPPORT offers signifi-
cant help in the reduction of pre-surgery anxieties, that can
even contribute to biological post-surgery processes (e.g.,
IL-8). However, the study design characteristics could also
contribute to the SUPPORT effects – the use of the same
trainers for both treatments reduces error variance due to
therapist differences, but could carry with it some risk of
contamination effects. Although treatment fidelity checks
indicated satisfactory adherence to the different treatment
protocols, modest contamination effects could still have
occurred.
Increases in CRP and pro-inflammatory cytokine levels
confirmed the inflammatory response after surgery.
However, cytokine levels were also affected by the inter-
vention post-surgery and during the recovery process.
Both psychological preoperative interventions induced
lower IL-8 increases after surgery. In addition, IL-6 con-
centrations were the lowest in the EXPECT group at
6 months follow-up. These cytokines may play a major
Rief et al. BMC Medicine  (2017) 15:4 
Page 10 of 13
 role in the pathogenesis of coronary artery diseases and
their treatments [34], although the functional relevance
of these effects has to be further investigated. Of note,
treatment-specific factors and placebo mechanisms fre-
quently use similar pathways of action, e.g., opioid path-
ways in placebo analgesia [35], dopaminergic pathways of
placebo effects in Parkinson’s disease [36], or neural plasti-
city effects of context factors in psychopharmacological
treatments [37]. Therefore, an immunological pathway of
expectation-based interventions in heart surgery patients
as one potential trajectory would parallel the findings from
other clinical conditions.
In general, most clinical trials in medicine focus on the
so-called specific treatment mechanisms, and on how to
optimize them. However, to optimize treatment outcome, it
is not enough to only optimize surgery procedures, drug

 compositions, etc. Treatment regimes should also be de-
signed to optimize patient-specific and contextual factors
that also contribute to positive treatment outcomes. These
person-specific aspects (such as expectation) and context-
ual factors interact with treatment-specific factors, and
must be taken into consideration for optimized treatment
planning.
Limitations
Despite positive effects on our primary outcome disabil-
ity, for several clinical variables, only a trend in favor of
EXPECT was found, and it is unclear whether larger
studies could provide even more convincing results (e.g.,
on variables such as re-hospitalization or LVEF). Rehospi-
talization rates, for instance, were too low in our trial to
show significant group differences. Moreover, our manipu-
lation check analyses confirmed intervention effects on
“control expectations”, while specific effects on outcome
expectations remained unclear. Larger, multi-centered tri-
als are therefore required not only to generalize from one
study site to healthcare systems in general, but also to in-
vestigate further clinical outcome variables. Sensitivity
analyses and identification of subgroups who maximally
benefit from our interventions should follow. Immune pa-
rameters should be only interpreted with caution, and
need more sophisticated investigations to better under-
stand their functionality. In general, the nature of this trial
is on providing first evidence for an innovative approach,
while confirmatory trials should follow.
Conclusions
To conclude, we were able to show that utilization of
placebo mechanisms is helpful to improve outcome even
in highly invasive medical interventions. A short-term
psychological intervention can be feasibly implemented
in a cardiac surgery unit, and participating in this inter-
vention improved long-term outcome after CABG, in
particular disability and QoL. Compared to previous
studies of psychological interventions in cardiac patients,
our intervention trial is characterized by a strong focus
on expectations, and a large sample size. A replication of
this approach and extension to other clinical interven-
tions is warranted.
