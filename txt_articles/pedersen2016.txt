Insulin resistance (IR) and metabolic syndrome are risk factors for 
both type 2 diabetes and ischaemic cardiovascular diseases,  
pathologies 
that are in epidemic growth worldwide. Mounting  
evidence suggests 
a link between the gut microbiome and human metabolic health1–4, 
with transferability of insulin resistance phenotypes through  
faecal 
 
microbiome transplants5,6. These effects may partly be  
mediated 
through the metabolome7. Serum levels of amino acids, most 
 
consistently the BCAAs8,9, triacylglycerols with low carbon number 
and double bonds10,11, as well as specific membrane phospholipids12, 
have previously been associated with IR and future risk of metabolic 
and cardiovascular morbidities. However, the origin of the abnormal 
IR-associated serum metabolome is largely unknown13.
To explore the relationships between the fasting serum  
metabolome 
and the gut microbiome in the states of IR and metabolic syndrome, 
we examined 291 non-diabetic Danish adults, of whom 277 had 
 
available gut microbial data from the MetaHIT1 study population. 
IR was estimated by homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR), 
which in epidemiological studies is a widely applied measure of IR, 
primarily as an estimate of hepatic IR14. Since IR is largely influenced 
by body mass index (BMI), we also estimated the IR index adjusted for 
BMI (HOMA-IRBMIadj). Metabolic syndrome was defined according 
to recommendations by the International Diabetes Federation15  
(see Methods). For comparative analyses we further included 
 
75 Danish type 2 diabetes patients4 with quantitative gut metagenomics 
data  
generated by the same experimental protocol. Characteristics of 
the study samples are given in Supplementary Table 1 and Extended 
Data Fig. 1.
Results
In the present study, we assessed the role of the gut microbiome as a 
source for key features of the serum metabolome profile,  
predicting 
metabolic and cardiovascular disorders in non-diabetic lean and obese 
people. Untargeted metabolome profiles were generated on fasting 
serum samples, applying two mass spectrometry-based  
analytical 
platforms and providing information about 325 polar metabolites 
(94 known, 231 unknown) and 876 molecular lipids (289 known, 
 
587 unknown), respectively (here collectively termed serum 
 
 
metabolites). These were binned into 74 co-abundance clusters across 
all individuals (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). We found 19 of 
the 74 metabolite clusters (26%), comprising 26 polar metabolites and 
367 lipids, to be significantly associated with both IR and  
metabolic 
syndrome, with consistent directionality across the 291 non-diabetic 
Insulin resistance is a forerunner state of ischaemic cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Here we show how the 
human gut microbiome impacts the serum metabolome and associates with insulin resistance in 277 non-diabetic Danish 
individuals. The serum metabolome of insulin-resistant individuals is characterized by increased levels of branched-chain 
amino acids (BCAAs), which correlate with a gut microbiome that has an enriched biosynthetic potential for BCAAs and is 
deprived of genes encoding bacterial inward transporters for these amino acids. Prevotella copri and Bacteroides vulgatus 
are identified as the main species driving the association between biosynthesis of BCAAs and insulin resistance, and in 
mice we demonstrate that P
. copri can induce insulin resistance, aggravate glucose intolerance and augment circulating 
levels of BCAAs. Our findings suggest that microbial targets may have the potential to diminish insulin resistance and 
reduce the incidence of common metabolic and cardiovascular disorders.

(FDR) < 
 0.1, Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). 
 
These 19 metabolite clusters separated into two groups that were 
either positively or negatively correlated with both IR and metabolic 
 
syndrome, referred hereafter to as the IR-metabotype and insulin 
 
sensitivity (IS)-metabotype, respectively (Fig. 1b, Supplementary 
Table 6, Supplementary Results and Extended Data Fig. 3). Most 
of these associations were confirmed in type 2 diabetes patients 
 
(see Supplementary Results for details).
In accordance with previous reports, the identifiable serum 
 
metabolites constituting the IR-metabotype mainly comprised 
amino acids (including BCAAs; see Supplementary Discussion), 
 
tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites, and a large number of tria-
cylglycerols (Supplementary Table 6, previous findings referenced 
therein). Interestingly, we found that serum BCAAs clustered with 
hydrocinnamic and indole-3-lactic acids (metabolite cluster M10, 
Supplementary Table 2), both of which belong to a class of phenolic 
compounds that are  
associated with gut microbial metabolism16. Serum 
levels of hydrocinnamic acid are affected by gut microbiota in mice17 
and hydrocinnamic acid is a known inhibitor of branched-chain α 
- 
keto acid dehydrogenase kinase, which regulates the breakdown of 
BCAAs18. By contrast, the IS-metabotype consisted solely of serum 
lipids,  
primarily phospholipids and triacylglycerols with odd carbon 
number and high double bond content (Supplementary Table 6). 
Hence, our results  
confirm previous reports of odd-chain fatty acids 
and  
polyunsaturated fatty acids as associated with reduced risk of type 
2 diabetes10,19. Plasma odd-chain fatty acids are often considered to be a 
product of  
microbial metabolism or a marker of dietary intake, especially 
of dairy  
products, although recent findings show that C15:0 and C17:0 
are also  
endogenously produced in adipocytes through α 
-oxidation 
 
of palmitic and stearic acid20,21. Based on our data, however, it is not 
possible to distinguish if these odd-chain fatty acids originate from 
dietary intake or bacterial  
metabolism. Surprisingly, the IS-metabotype 
also included C16:0-ceramide and sphingomyelin. Elevated circulat-
ing concentrations of ceramides22, including the C16:0 ceramide23,24, 
are generally implicated in the pathogenesis of IR. However, our data 
suggest that C16:0-ceramide may play a more complex role in the 
 
regulation of host insulin sensitivity than recognized until now.
Some of the IR- and metabolic-syndrome-associated fasting serum 
metabolites, such as the essential BCAAs, cannot be  
synthesized 
by humans and must therefore originate from ingested food or gut 
 
microbial synthesis. Therefore, we investigated the metabolic 
  
potential 
of the gut microbiome in relation to these metabolites using KEGG 
functional modules (Fig. 1a), that is, a set of manually curated 
 
functional and pathway units from the KEGG database, each  
consisting 
of a number of KEGG orthologous gene groups25.
Forty-one of the 567 microbiome functional modules (7%) were 
 
significantly associated (Mann–Whitney U-test, FDR < 
 0.1) with one 
or more of the IR and metabolic syndrome phenotypes (Extended 
Data Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 7). All 41 functional modules were 
 
furthermore associated with the IR- and IS-metabotypes (Figs 1c and 2), 
 
with a majority also differing in abundance in the expected direc-
tion in type 2 diabetes patients (Supplementary Results). A majority 
(23/33) of the HOMA-IR associated modules remained significant after 
adjusting for BMI, while six additional modules were identified upon 
the BMI adjustment (Extended Data Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 7). 
 
The results suggest that, in this sample of lean and obese individuals, the 
functional microbial shift in IR is largely independent of BMI, which 
should be further validated in population-based cohorts. Furthermore, 
we found this functional shift to also partly overlap with functional 
characteristics of a low richness gut microbiome, as the IR associations 
of many functional modules (24/33) were attenuated after adjusting for 
microbial gene richness (Supplementary Results). We observed only a 
minor separation in the microbiome or metabolomic data correspond-
ing to patient subgroups based on the five clinical components of the 
metabolic syndrome (Supplementary Results).
The cross-domain associations between the IR and metabolic syn-
drome phenotypes, the serum metabolome and the gut microbiome 
described above may suggest functional relationships. Notably, the 
functional modules of the microbiome that were positively associated 
with both HOMA-IR and the IR-metabotype contained enzymes for 
biosynthesis of BCAAs, cofactors, vitamins, lipopolysaccharides and 
various transport systems, some of which have elevated  
expression 
in gut microbiomes transplanted into mice from obese donors6. In 
 
contrast, the microbiome negatively associated with HOMA-IR and 
the IR-metabotype contained functional modules important for 
 
methanogenesis, pyruvate oxidation and transport systems, including 
inward transport of BCAAs. Noticeably, the microbiome functional 
modules that were associated with the two metabotypes showed a large 
overlap with the metabolic pathways essential for microbiome–host 
interactions mediated through metabolites, including the BCAAs, as 
highlighted in a recent Caenorhabditis elegans study26.
Coherently, the majority (60/81) of the microbial species associated 
with IR or metabolic syndrome (Supplementary Table 8) correlated 
significantly with the IR- and IS-metabotypes (Supplementary Results,

Extended Data Figs 4 and 5). To identify the species that  
contributed the 
most to the associations between the microbiome functional  
modules 
and HOMA-IR, we iterated the correlation analysis,  
leaving out 
genes from a single species in each iteration (see Fig. 1d and Methods 
for details). For several functional modules, the correlations with 
HOMA-IR were driven by only a few species (Supplementary Table 9). 
 
Notably, the positive associations between HOMA-IR and the biosyn-
thesis modules of BCAA, tryptophan and lipopolysaccharides were 
largely driven by P. copri followed by B.  
vulgatus, as they were almost 
abolished when genes from these species were  
omitted. Although these 
two species were the main drivers for many of the same functional 
modules, they were at the same time significantly anti- 
correlated 
(Spearman correlation coefficient = − 
0.38, P = 9.0 × 10−11, Extended 
Data Fig. 6), consistent with the previously reported trade-off 
between these  
genera27. Still, the abundance of each of these  
species 
(when present) correlated positively with HOMA-IR (Extended Data 
 
Fig. 7, Supplementary Table 10), as did their combined abundance 
across all individuals (Spearman correlation  
coefficient = 
 0.20, 
P = 
 0.001, Extended Data Fig. 6). The possible importance of P. copri 
is further highlighted by its positive correlation with the BCAA-
containing metabolite cluster M10 in the 94 individuals with detectable 
levels of the species (Spearman correlation coefficient = 
 0.22, P = 
 0.034, 
Extended Data Fig. 7, Supplementary Table 10). However, the corre-
lations of P. copri to the BCAA-containing metabolite cluster M10 
and HOMA-IR were abolished in the full cohort of 277 non-diabetic 
individuals (P = 
 0.44 and P = 
 0.67, respectively), suggesting that in 
the absence of P. copri other species may influence the levels of the 
M10 metabolite cluster and HOMA-IR. P. copri, a hallmark species 
of the Prevotella enterotype28 (see Supplementary Results for further 
discussion), has been associated with rheumatoid arthritis29 but not 
with IR in humans. B. vulgatus is reported to correlate positively with 
fat mass and other markers of IR in humans30, whereas a mouse study 
suggested protection against the development of metabolic  
disorders, 
although only in the context of a low-fat diet6. Thus, the role of 
 
B. vulgatus in IR and metabolic disorders seems complex and is proba-
bly context-specific. Among other driver species for the microbial func-
tional modules positively correlated with HOMA-IR were Escherichia 
coli, Sutterella wadsworthensis and unclassified Sutterella and Prevotella 
species (Extended Data Fig. 8, Supplementary Table 9).
In contrast to the functional modules enriched in the gut microbi-
ome of insulin-resistant individuals, which were driven by relatively 
few microbial species each with high impact, all microbial functional 
modules associated with increased insulin sensitivity were driven by 
multiple species, all with minor effect (Supplementary Results).
The microbial functional module analysis presented in Fig. 2 high-
lighted an increased BCAA biosynthesis potential, but depletion 
for genes encoding the transport system for bacterial BCAA uptake 
(referred to as inward BCAA transport) in the gut microbiome of 
insulin-resistant individuals (Fig. 3a). These findings synergistically 
contribute to an increased BCAA pool and are of considerable interest

in the light of the report demonstrating that serum BCAA levels are 
increased in mice following transplantation of stools from insulin- 
resistant individuals6. The described gut microbiome features are 
 
consistent with the elevated serum levels of BCAAs in insulin-resistant 
individuals (Fig. 3b), suggesting that an increased ratio between gut 
microbial biosynthesis and uptake of BCAAs contributes to elevated 
serum BCAA concentrations, which are known to associate with IR31. 
Moreover, the difference between the potential for BCAA biosynthesis 
and inward BCAA transport of the gut microbiome was even more 
significantly associated with the serum BCAA concentrations than 
either of the two functional modules alone (Supplementary Table 11). 
Importantly, while the IR-associated increase in the microbial potential 
for BCAA biosynthesis was largely driven by P. copri or B. vulgatus 
 
(see above), the reduced capacity for bacterial BCAA uptake was driven 
by reduced abundance of multiple species, including B. crossotus and 
E. siraeum (Fig. 3c, d).
Consistent correlations with HOMA-IR were observed for almost

Figure 3 | The ratio between the gut microbiome potential for BCAA 
biosynthesis and inward transport is linked to fasting serum BCAA 
levels and IR in humans and can be attributed to a few driver species, 
including P. copri that induces an aggravation of glucose intolerance 
in mice concomitantly with elevated serum BCAA levels. a, The 
total abundance of all microbial species containing genes coding for 
BCAA biosynthesis (Spearman correlation coefficient (SCC) = 0.30, 
P = 5.3 × 10−7) and inward transport (SCC = − 
0.17, P = 4.5 × 10−3) 
potential is shown in green and blue, respectively, for 277 non-diabetic 
individuals ordered by their HOMA-IR levels. The slopes are significantly 
different (P = 4.0 × 10−8, see Methods). b, Fasting serum BCAA levels  
in 291 non-diabetic individuals ordered by HOMA-IR levels  
(SCC: leucine = 0.40, isoleucine = 0.44, valine = 0.49, P < 4 × 10−12).  
c, d, The effect of specific microbial species on associations between 
BCAA biosynthesis and transport, respectively, and HOMA-IR in 277 
non-diabetic individuals; illustrated by the change in background-adjusted 
median SCC (SCCbg.adj) between HOMA-IR and the BCAA biosynthesis/
transport functional modules when a given species has been excluded 
from the analysis (see Methods). e, Suggested model of the microbiome 
contribution to serum BCAA levels and IR. Fasting serum BCAA levels 
are influenced by microbial BCAA biosynthesis and uptake; these levels 
in turn may influence host insulin sensitivity. f, Changes in mouse serum 
BCAA levels (mean ± s.e.m.) after P. copri or sham gavaging for two weeks 
before challenge. Asterisks indicate significance between P. copri-gavaged 
(n = 12) and sham-gavaged control mice (n = 12) and significance

biosynthesis and transport modules respectively, lending further 
credence to the importance of these modules (Extended Data Fig. 9, 
Supplementary Table 12). Notably, of the BCAA biosynthesis enzymes, 
d-citramalate synthase showed the strongest individual positive 
 
correlation with HOMA-IR (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.24, 
P = 
 4.89 × 
 10−5). d-citramalate synthase constitutes the first step 
in a less common threonine-independent isoleucine biosynthesis 
 
pathway32. While most microorganisms synthesize isoleucine from 
threonine33, 87 gut microbial species identified in our cohort  
(including 
both P. copri and B. vulgatus, Supplementary Table 13), contained the 
d-citramalate synthase gene, highlighting the importance of this less 
common pathway in the human gut microbiome.
Our findings are summarized in the model shown in Fig. 3e, which 
offers a mechanistic explanation for the increased circulating BCAA 
concentrations that are known to correlate positively with IR31 and 
 
type 2 diabetes8. The difference in functional potential between 
 
microbial BCAA biosynthesis and BCAA uptake explained 2.4–3.1% 
of the variance in serum BCAA levels (Supplementary Table 11). 
In  
comparison, less than 1% of variance is explained by currently 
 
identified variants in the human genome, although the heritability of 
fasting serum BCAA levels34 is estimated to be 0.41–0.49.
P. copri was the strongest driver species for the positive association 
between microbial BCAA biosynthesis in the gut and IR, suggesting 
a possible causal relation. This assumption is further supported by 
several reports associating Prevotellaceae35–37, and more specifically 
P. copri29,38, with intestinal inflammation, an important contributor 
to host IR. To experimentally address the relation between P. copri 
and abnormal glucose metabolism, we compared P. copri (n = 
 12) 
and sham-gavaged (n = 
 12) C57BL/6J male mice on a high-fat diet 
 
(Fig. 1e). Notably, two weeks of P. copri challenge aggravated glucose 
intolerance (Extended Data Fig. 10a) and increased serum total BCAA 
levels  
(compared with baseline: likelihood ratio test, P = 
 0.004, Fig. 3f). 
Insulin sensitivity was reduced after three weeks of P. copri challenge 
(Fig. 3g, P = 
 0.032), suggesting a potentially causal role of P. copri in 
mediating the increase in serum BCAA and IR. The relatively modest 
effect of the P. copri inoculation on serum BCAA levels may reflect that 
P. copri correlated more strongly to HOMA-IR than to BCAAs in the 
human cohort (Supplementary Table 10). Importantly, upon  
glucose 
challenge, the plasma insulin excursion rates were indistinguishable 
between groups (Extended Data Fig. 10b; P = 
 0.80), hence negating 
beta cell malfunction as a confounding variable. It should be noted 
that Prevotellaceae (and thus P. copri) were a minor component of the 
mouse microbiome in both groups upon feeding with a high-fat diet, 
as evidenced by faecal 16S rDNA amplicon analysis (Extended Data 
Fig. 10c). Despite minor compositional changes in the gut  
microbiota 
(adonis, P = 
 0.04), we found no alterations of the relative abundances 
of any single family component thereof to be significant upon gavage 
(Extended Data Fig. 10c, FDR > 
 0.05). In contrast, P. copri was sig-
nificantly increased (Extended Data Fig. 10d, P = 
 0.0058),  
suggesting 
that it contributed to the observed pathophysiological changes. This 
conclusion is further supported by the direct correlation between 
 
P. copri abundances and HOMA-IR (Fig. 3h, Spearman correlation 
coefficient = 
 0.46, P = 
 0.040). Interestingly, an inverse relationship 
between glucose intolerance and P. copri challenge was recently 
reported39. However, in the latter study a completely different dietary 
regimen, high in fibre and low in fat, was used, suggesting that the effect 
of P. copri is diet-dependent. Furthermore, it should be noted that the 
feed used in the present study contained soy protein, which is low in 
BCAAs, as the protein source, contrasting the use of casein, high in 
BCAAs, in the study by Kovatcheva-Datchary et al.39.
Discussion
By integrating data on host insulin sensitivity and metabolic  
syndrome, 
gut microbiome, and fasting serum metabolome, we were able to 
demonstrate clear metabolome signatures of IR phenotypes among 
non-diabetic individuals and validate them in patients with type 2 
diabetes. The IR-associated metabolome associates with functional 
components of the IR-linked gut microbiome: notably the increased 
potential for lipopolysaccharide and BCAA biosynthesis, and reduced 
potential for BCAA transport into bacterial cells, methanogenesis and 
pyruvate oxidation.
Studies demonstrating the association of fasting serum BCAA  
levels 
with incident type 2 diabetes8, the normalization of BCAA levels in 
obese individuals after bariatric surgery40 and the development of IR 
in rats after BCAA diet supplementation31 suggest a potentially causa-
tive role of the BCAAs, or their breakdown products41,42, in metabolic 
disorders, although the reason as to why they are elevated in the first 
place is not well established. Potential explanations include reduced 
BCAA breakdown in adipose tissue43,44 and liver45. Consistent relation-
ships in our data between serum concentrations of BCAAs, bacterial 
BCAA biosynthesis and inward transport potentials, and the severity 
of IR phenotypes are reinforced by the intriguing findings that BCAAs 
co-vary tightly with fasting serum metabolites known to be of microbial 
origin. This suggests that the gut microbiota is another independent 
contributing source of elevated serum BCAA levels in common human 
states of IR. Furthermore, positive correlations between microbial 
 
functions—including BCAA biosynthesis—and IR are largely driven 
by a few species only, notably P. copri and B. vulgatus, suggesting that 
they may directly impact host metabolism. We tested this hypothesis 
in mice fed a high-fat diet, and found that a challenge with P. copri led 
to increased circulating serum levels of BCAAs, insulin resistance and 
an aggravation of glucose intolerance. We conclude that dysbiosis of the 
human gut microbiota impacts the serum metabolome and contributes 
to insulin resistance.
Importantly, while our findings relate to non-diabetic individuals 
and type 2 diabetes patients with preserved insulin secretion, they 
cannot yet be generalized to patients with impaired insulin secretion 
(Supplementary Discussion). Future physiological studies are needed 
to elucidate how the intestinal BCAAs and other amino acids enter the 
bloodstream and from which intestinal location they are absorbed. 
Furthermore, investigations of how dietary changes alone or in com-
bination with microbial or pharmacological interventions may impact 
the microbiome and, in particular, influence P. copri modulation of 
serum BCAA levels will open novel avenues to counter the pathogen-
esis of IR and its linked epidemics of common metabolic and cardio-
vascular disorders.

METHODS
Human study population. The study population comprised 291 normoglycaemic 
and middle-aged Danish MetaHIT individuals as previously reported1, as well 
as 75 Danish type 2 diabetes patients4. All analyses involving gut microbiome 
data were restricted to 75 type 2 diabetes patients and 277 out of the 291 of the 
non- 
diabetic individuals whose data passed all quality control criteria (see details 
below), whereas all non-microbiome analyses involved the full set of 291 non- 
diabetic individuals. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size.
Of the 75 type 2 diabetes patients, ten patients (13%) received no hyperglycae-
mic medications, 58 patients (77%) received the biguanide compound, metformin; 
of these 28 patients (37%) received metformin as the only anti- 
hyperglycaemic 
medication, 10 patients (13%) received sulfonylurea alone or in combination 
with metformin, 14 patients (19%) received a combination of oral anti-diabetic 
drugs and insulin treatment and 4 patients (5%) were on insulin treatment 
only. Eleven patients (15%) were treated with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) 
 
inhibitors or  
glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), all of them in combination with 
metformin. Patients were reported as receiving anti-hypertensive treatment if at 
least one of the following drugs were reported: spironolactone, thiazides, loop 
 
diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, moxonidin or drugs affect-
ing the renin-angiotensin system (in total n = 55; 73%). Patients receiving  
statins 
were reported as receiving lipid-lowering medication (in total n = 
 56; 75%). We 
have previously shown that metformin has impact on the configuration and 
 
functional potential of human gut microbiota whereas no significant differences 
were observed for other anti-diabetic medications, diuretics, or lipid lowering- and 
blood pressure lowering drugs4.
In short, all study participants (Caucasian Danes) were recruited from the 
 
population-based Inter99 study46 or from the outpatient clinic at Steno Diabetes 
Center. Study volunteers were invited for two visits with approximately 14 days 
apart. At the first visit the participants were examined in the morning after an 
overnight fast of at least 10 h and without prior morning physical activity. At the 
second visit a DEXA scan was performed to evaluate body fat percentage. All 
 
samples (from both non-diabetic and diabetic individuals) were generated within 
the Danish part of the MetaHIT consortium (http://www.metahit.eu), and the 
infrastructure of this project was constructed specifically to make all samples 
comparable by ensuring similar handling and by minimizing the risk of batch 
effects. All of these samples were collected individually as participant recruitment 
proceeded, by the same staff and using the same protocol for both stool and blood 
samples. Serum for metabolomics and stool for metagenomics were stored at 
 
− 
80 °C until the planned analyses took place.
The study was approved by the Ethical Committees of the Capital Region 
of Denmark (HC-2008-017 and H-15000306) and was in accordance with the 
 
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All individuals gave written informed 
consent before participating in the study.
Phenotyping. Clinical phenotyping and fasting biochemistry were performed 
and analysed as reported1. HOMA-IR was calculated as: (fasting plasma glucose 
(mmol/ l) × 
 fasting serum insulin (mU/ l))/22.514 and HOMA-B (a measure of 
pancreatic beta-cell function) calculated as (20 × fasting plasma insulin)/(fasting 
plasma glucose − 
 3.5)14. Due to the confounding effects of anti-diabetic treat-
ment, HOMA-IR and HOMA-B were only assessed in non-diabetic individuals. 
BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height (m2) and obesity defined as 
BMI > 
30 kg/m2. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the International 
Diabetes Federation15. Non-diabetic individuals classified as having the metabolic 
syndrome in accordance with the IDF (n = 
 163) were characterized by central 
obesity defined by gender-specific increased waist circumference as well of two 
of four additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease: raised levels of fasting 
plasma glucose or triglycerides, or reduced fasting plasma level of HDL-cholesterol, 
or raised blood pressure. In order to account for differences in age, sex and BMI, 
we matched the 75 Danish type 2 diabetes patients with 75 age-, sex- and BMI-
matched individuals chosen from the non-diabetic study samples of 277 Danish 
individuals (Supplementary Table 1).
Generation of serum metabolome data set. The metabolomics analyses were 
performed on all human samples together, in randomized order, both related to 
the sample preparation and instrumental analysis. Similarly, all 48 mouse samples 
were analysed for BCAAs together in randomized order. Control serum samples 
consisting of pooled human serum were included in equal intervals as part of the 
sample run for both human and mouse samples (n = 30 for humans and n = 4 for 
mice), as well as a set of pure standard samples (pure standards in a solvent for 
evaluation of instrument performance and robustness), extracted standard samples 
(standards going through the same sample preparation to monitor the performance 
on the whole analytical procedure), blank samples (only solvent to observe possible 
background peaks) and calibration samples.
Metabolomics analyses were also conducted on previously reported Danish 
type 1 diabetes patients4 (n = 
 30 for polar metabolites, n = 
 31 for molecular lipids). 
 
These data were only used for the co-abundance clustering of metabolites 
 
(see below) to increase sample size for finding inter-variable conditions. Type 1 
 
diabetes patients are distinctive from type 2 diabetes patients as they represent 
both a very different pathology and lifelong medical/lifestyle treatment and were 
consequently not used for any other analyses.
Human and mouse samples were analysed at VTT Technical Research Centre 
of Finland (Espoo, Finland) and Steno Diabetes Center (Gentofte, Denmark), 
respectively, using the same type of instrument with identical analytical conditions.
Analysis of fasting serum polar metabolites by GC × GC-TOFMS. Serum polar 
metabolites were analysed in 396 human and 48 mouse serum samples (24 pre- 
and 24 post-gavage samples) using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chroma-
tography combined with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC-TOFMS, a 
LECO Pegasus 4D equipped with a cryogenic modulator from LECO Corp.) with 
a method described previously47. Specifically, 400 μ 
l methanol and 10 μ 
l internal 
standard mixture (C17:0 (186.5 mg/l), deuterated valine (37 mg/l) and succinic 
acid-d4 (63 mg/l)) were added to 30 μ 
l of serum samples. The samples were vortex 
mixed and centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 r.p.m. and half of the supernatant was 
evaporated to dryness. This was followed by two-step derivatization using methox-
imation and silylation by first adding 25 μ 
l methoxamine (45 °C, 60 min) and then 
 
25 μ 
l N-trimethylsilyl-N-methyl trifluoroacetamide (45 °C, 60 min). Finally, 
a  
retention index standard mixture (n-alkanes, 25 μ 
l,  
concentration = 
 8 mg/l) 
and an injection standard  
(4,4′ 
- 
dibromooctafluorobiphenyl, 50 μ 
l, 
 
concentration = 
 10 mg/l), both in hexane, were added to the mixture. The 
 
calibration consisted of six points for each quantified metabolite.
The columns were as follows: a methyl-deactivated retention gap (1.5 m × 
 0.53 mm 
 
i.d.) was connected to 10 m × 
 0.18 mm Rxi-5MS (phase thickness 0.18 μ 
m) and to 
1.5 m × 0.1 mm BPX-50 (phase thickness 0.1 μ 
m). Helium was used as the carrier 
gas at a constant pressure mode (40 psig). A 4-s separation time was used in the 
second dimension. The temperature program was as follows for the first- 
dimension 
column: 50 °C (2 min), at 7 °C/min to 240 °C and at 25 °C/min to 300 °C (3 min). 
The second-dimension column temperature was 20 °C higher than the correspond-
ing first-dimension column throughout the program.
The analytical method used allows for combined targeted and untargeted 
 
analysis, where a selected subset of metabolites can be quantified47. In the  
present 
study, quantitation of 27 target metabolites (stearic acid, oleic acid,  
linoleic acid, pal-
mitic acid, citric acid, glutamic acid, 3,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid, 3- 
hydroxybutyric 
acid, threonine, 2,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid,  
phenylalanine, tyrosine, 2-hydroxy-
butyric acid, serine, glyceric acid, methionine, glycine,  
leucine, isoleucine, valine, 
ornithine, proline, cholesterol, arachidonic acid,  
alanine and aspartic acid) was 
done by external calibration curves for each individual  
metabolite.
ChromaTOF vendor software (LECO) was used for within-sample data 
 
processing, and the Guineu software47 was used for alignment, normalization and 
peak matching across samples. The normalization was performed by  
correction 
for internal standards and specific target metabolites were additionally quantified 
using external calibration curves. Other mass spectra from the GC × 
 GC-TOFMS 
analysis were searched against the NIST Mass Spectral Library and Golm 
Metabolome Database48, also using retention index data in the  
identification. 
Artefact peaks due to chemical background and compounds outside the linear 
range of the method were removed from the data set. Control serum samples 
(n = 
 30 for human, n = 
 4 for mouse analyses) were analysed together with the 
samples. The relative standard deviation (RSD) for internal standards, spiked into 
the samples, was on average of 12.8% for the human serum sample analyses. The 
RSD% of the quantified metabolites in the control serum samples (n = 
 30) was on 
average 18.5% for the analysis of human serum samples. For quantitative analysis 
of BCAAs in mice serum samples, the RSD% was 13.3% for isoleucine, 11.2% for 
leucine and 24.2% for valine in control serum samples (n = 
 4), and for internal 
standards in mice serum the RSD was on average 16.6%. Neither sample prepara-
tion nor analysis order showed any significant effect on the results.
All serum metabolite peaks that were present (non-zero value) in more than 
50% of samples were included in the data analyses, including the unidentified 
ones. We reasoned that inclusion of complete data as obtained from the platform 
best represent the global metabolome as covered by the platform. The unidenti-
fied peaks were annotated with their structural class from the Golm Metabolome 
Database48 using functional group prediction based on the fragmentation 
 
patterns47. In total 325 (94 known and 231 unknown) serum polar metabolites 
were measured in the human study.
Analysis of serum molecular lipids using UHPLC-QTOFMS. Serum 
 
molecular lipids were analysed in 397 human serum samples using ultra-high- 
performance liquid chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spec-
trometry (UHPLC-QTOFMS Q-Tof Premier mass spectrometer, Waters, Inc.) 
using electrospray ionization in positive ionization mode with a methodology 
described earlier49. Specifically, a standard mixture 1 (20 μ 
l) containing LPC(17:0), 
PC(17:0/17:0), PE(17:0/17:0) and Cer(d18:1/17:0) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.)

 ARTICLE RESEARCH
and TG(17:0/17:0/17:0) (Larodan Fine Chemicals AB), all at concentration of 
10 mg/l, was added to 10 μ 
l of serum samples and the samples were extracted 
with chloroform and methanol (2:1; 100 μ 
l). The lower phase (60 μ 
l) was  
collected 
after centrifugation and 20 μ 
l of internal standard mixture 2 (LPC(16:1D3), 
 
 
concentration: 10 mg/l, PC(16:1/16:1-D6), concentration: 15 mg/l, and 
TG(16:0/16:0/16:0-13C3), concentration: 15 mg/l, was added. The extracts were 
analysed on an Acquity UPLCTM BEH C18 2.1 × 
 100 mm column packed with 
1.7 μ 
m particles. The solvent system included 1% 1 M NH4Ac, 0.1% HCOOH and 
acetonitrile/isopropanol (1:1, 1% 1M NH4Ac, 0.1% HCOOH) in gradient elution 
mode with a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The serum lipid profiling was carried out at 
a mass range of m/z 300–1,200 with scan duration of 0.2 s.
The data processing using MZmine 2 (ref. 50) included alignment of peaks, peak 
integration, isotopic grouping, normalization, and peak identification. Serum lipids 
were identified using an internal spectral library or with tandem MS and data were 
normalized using the internal standards representatives of each class of serum lipid 
present in the samples as previously described49. Sphingomyelins were normalized 
with the PC standard. All lipid peaks were included in the data analyses, including 
the unidentified ones. Control serum samples (n = 
 30), extracted standard samples 
(n = 22) as well as blanks and pure standard samples were analysed together with 
the study samples. The standard deviation (RSD) for internal standards, spiked 
into the samples, was 8–13% in serum samples (n = 
 397) and 9.1% in the extracted 
standards (n = 
 22). The RSD% of the identified lipids in the control serum  
samples 
was on average 12.8%. In total 876 molecular serum lipids, 289 known and 
 
587 unknown, were measured. Neither sample preparation nor analysis order 
showed any significant effect on the results.
Clustering of co-abundant serum metabolites. Clusters of co-abundant serum 
metabolites were identified using the R package WGCNA51 (Fig. 1a). Serum polar 
metabolites and serum molecular lipids (see above) were analysed separately but 
are collectively referred to as serum metabolites. Signed, weighted metabolite 
co-abundance correlation (biweight midcorrelations (a median-based  
correlation 
measure that is more robust to outliers than Pearson correlation52,53) after log2 
transformation) networks were calculated across all examined individuals. 
 
A scale-free topology criterion was used to choose the soft threshold β = 
 13 for 
the polar metabolites and β = 
 14 for molecular lipid correlations. Clusters were 
 
identified with the dynamic hybrid tree-cutting algorithm54, using deepSplit 
of 4 and a  
minimum cluster size of 3 and 5 for polar metabolite and molecu-
lar lipid clusters, respectively. Serum metabolites that did not fit the clustering 
 
criteria were  
combined in a group named ‘remaining’
. The profile of each serum 
 
metabolite cluster was summarized by the cluster eigenvector (that is, the first 
principal  
component of the metabolite abundances across individuals). Similar 
clusters were subsequently merged if the biweight mid-correlation between 
the cluster’s  
eigenvectors exceeded 0.8 and 0.75 for serum polar metabolite and 
serum  
molecular lipid clusters, respectively. The serum polar metabolite and 
serum molecular lipid clusters (labelled M00–M35 and L00–L39, respectively) are 
 
collectively termed metabolite clusters.
Construction of a non-redundant metagenomics reference gene catalogue. The 
reference gene catalogue used in the present study was constructed from Illumina 
shotgun sequencing data from 620 publically available faecal samples4,55. The data 
was processed using the MOCAT software package (version 1.1)56. Reads were 
trimmed (option read_trim_filter) using a quality and length cut-off of 20 and 
30 bp, respectively. Trimmed reads were subsequently screened against a custom 
database of Illumina adapters (option screen_fastafile) and the human genome 
version 19 using a 90% identity cut-off (option screen). The resulting high-quality 
reads were assembled (option assembly) and assemblies revised (option  
assembly_
revision). Genes were predicted on scaftigs with a minimum length of 500 bp 
(option gene_prediction).
Predicted protein-coding genes with a minimum length of 100 bp were clus-
tered at 95% sequence identity using CD-HIT (version 4.6.1)57 with parameters 
set to: -c 0.95, -G 0 -aS 0.9, -g 1, -r 1). The representative genes of the result-
ing clusters were ‘padded’ (that is, extended up to 100 bp at each end of the 
sequence using the sequence information available from the assembled scaftigs), 
resulting in the final reference gene catalogue used in this study. The reference 
gene catalogue was functionally annotated using SmashCommunity (version 
1.6)58 after aligning the amino acid sequence of each gene to the KEGG database 
 
(version 62)25.
Profiling of metagenomics samples. We obtained metagenomics data for the 291 
non-diabetic individuals and 75 type 2 diabetes patients as previously described1,4. 
The DNA extraction protocol was standardized for all samples and all  
sequencing 
was done using Illumina platforms, using paired-end reads (Supplementary 
 
Table 14). Of the 291 non-diabetic samples, 14 that were sequenced with the 
Illumina Solexa technology had average read length below 42 nt (leading to 
less  
certain mappings) and were thus excluded from further analyses to avoid 
unnecessary biases, resulting in a final set of 277 non-diabetic individuals with 
gut microbiome data. All 75 type 2 diabetes samples passed all quality control 
criteria. Sequencing statistics for each sample have previously been described4 
and are repeated in Supplementary Table 14. Raw insert (sequenced fragments 
of DNA represented by single or paired-end reads) count profiles were generated 
using MOCAT56 by mapping high-quality reads from each metagenome to the 
reference gene catalogue (option screen) using an alignment length and identity 
cut-off of 45% and 95%, respectively. The abundance profile for each catalogue 
gene was calculated as the sum of uniquely mapped sequence reads (97% identity) 
using 7M sequence reads per sample (downsized). KEGG Orthology (KO) gene 
group abundance profiles were calculated by summing the abundance of genes 
annotated to the respective KO gene group. KOs were mapped to microbiome 
functional KEGG modules based on annotations downloaded on 14 January 2014 
from the KEGG BRITE database. Gene richness was calculated as the number 
of genes with abundance higher than zero in the given sample (downsized). For 
negative binominal statistics all uniquely mapped sequence reads were used to 
estimate abundances.
Metagenomics species construction. The gene catalogue was clustered by 
co-abundance as described by Nielsen et al.59, which defined 10,754 co- 
abundance 
gene groups (CAGs) with high correlations (Pearson correlation coefficient 
 
> 
0.9). The 925 largest of these, with more than 700 genes, were considered as 
 
metagenomics species (MGS) and referred to as species throughout the article. 
The abundance profiles of the CAGs and MGS were determined as the medium 
gene abundance (7M reads per sample) throughout the samples. Furthermore, the 
CAGs and MGSs were taxonomically annotated, by summing up the taxonomical 
 
annotation of their genes as described by Nielsen et al.59. Each gene was  
annotated 
by sequence similarity to known reference genomes (blastN, E-value < 
 0.001 
against imomi4 genome databank, August 2012 release).
Mouse intervention study with Prevotella copri. P. copri (CB7, DSMZ) was 
 
cultivated under anaerobic conditions in PYG medium (SSI Diagnostica), 
 
harvested in log phase, aliquoted and stored in 10% glycerol at − 
80 °C until use. 
Mice (24 male WT C57BL/6J, Taconic, 10 weeks of age) were housed in cages of 
four and kept at 22 °C in a specific-pathogen-free facility under a 12 h light-dark 
cycle, fed ad libitum and had free access to water. Number of mice (sample size) was 
selected based on previous experience in measurement of dysglycaemic  
phenotype 
in a mouse model, but was not arrived at through formal analysis. After 2 weeks 
of acclimatization on a standard chow diet (Altromin 1310, Altromin), mice were 
transferred to a soy protein-based 60% high-fat diet low in BCAAs (12492D, 
Ssniff) in order to prime for later development of glucose intolerance and insulin 
 
resistance and sham-gavaged (1% glycerol in PBS) twice a week. After three weeks 
on high-fat diet, mice were divided into two equal groups of 12 mice each (three 
 
cages per group, minimizing the influence of potential cage effects). The groups 
were not randomized but stratified by magnetic resonance (MR)-based fat mass 
and weight. For the following three weeks, mice were gavaged twice weekly with 
100 μ 
l of either P. copri (5 × 
 108 CFU/mouse, 1% glycerol in PBS) or sham while 
remaining on the high-fat diet. Blood for BCAA measurements was drawn 3 days 
before diet change and 11 days post diet change in EDTA-coated tubes kept on 
ice and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 1,000g before storage at − 
80 °C until 
metabolomics analysis.
An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed after two weeks of P. copri 
challenge. The mice were fasted for 5 h with free access to water and gavaged with 
3 g glucose/kg lean mass. Blood glucose was measured in tail vein blood before 
and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min post the glucose bolus, using standard Contour 
Next Test Strips that met 2013 accuracy criteria requirements from International 
Organization for standardization of diagnostic tests (Bayer Contour).
Insulin secretion capacity was evaluated by measuring plasma insulin before 
(T0) and 15 min post glucose bolus (T15) using an electrochemiluminescence assay 
(Meso Scale Diagnostics) following the manufacturer’s instructions. 
An insulin tolerance test was performed after 3 weeks of bacterial challenge. 
The mice were acclimatized in clean cages without bedding for 2 h and injected 
intra peritoneally with 0.75 U insulin/kg lean mass in alternating order. Insulin 
was diluted in succinulated gelatin (Gelofusine B. Braun Melsungen AG), allowing 
increased efficacy of insulin administration, thus minimizing intra  
experimental 
standard variations. Blood glucose was measured immediately before and 15, 
30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min post insulin bolus, using standard Contour Next Test 
Strips that met accuracy criteria requirements from International Organization for 
 
standardization of diagnostic tests (Bayer Contour).
In all mouse experiments performed, mice were handled in alternating order. 
During ITT and OGTT the operator was semi-blinded as each mouse was assigned 
a random number corresponding to the time (minute) for insulin/glucose bolus 
administration.
For quantitative PCR and 16 rDNA amplicon sequencing, bacterial DNA 
from faecal samples were extracted using a NucleoSpin soil kit (Macherey-
Nagel) according to manufacturer’s instructions. DNA yield and integrity

were assessed using a Nanodrop and agarose gel electrophoresis, respectively. 
Quantitative PCR analyses were performed using the SYBR Green qPCR 
Master mix (Thermo Scientific) and the Stratagene Mx3000P qPCR System. 
The  
relative abundance of P. copri was determined by normalization to the 
 
reference 16S rDNA gene using the comparative CT method75 for  
relative 
gene expression. Primer sequences were previously published29 and are as 
follows: Universal 16S forward: 5′-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAGT-3′, 
 
Universal 16S reverse: 5′-ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGGC-3′, P. copri forward: 
 
5′-CCGGACTCCTGCCCCTGCAA-3′, P. copri reverse: 5′-GTTGCGCCA 
GGCACTGCGAT-3′.
The PCR-based library formation for the 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing was 
performed using 10 ng DNA, 0.2 μ 
M of each barcoded forward and reverse primer, 
0.2 mM dNTPs and 0.5 units Phusion high fidelity DNA polymerase (Thermo 
Scientific) in a total volume of 25 μ

) were used, both with Illumina 
adaptor sequences in the 5′ 
 end60,61. Cycling condition was as follows: 98 °C for 
30 s followed by 35 cycles of 98 °C for 5 s, 56 °C for 20 s and 70 °C for 20 s. PCR 
products were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter) beads. 
Subsequently, samples were pooled in equal concentrations and sequenced using 
an Illumina MiSeq with V2 PE500 cartridge (500 cycles).
For 16S rDNA data analysis, generated sequences were analysed using QIIME 
v.1.9.1 with default settings. Chimaera checking was performed using UCHIME62 
and de novo OTU-picking was performed using UCLUST63 with 97% sequence 
similarity. Representative sequences were assigned taxonomy against the 
Greengenes database v.13_864 using the RDP-classifier65. Subsequent analyses 
were performed in R v.3.2.3 using the metagenomeSeq66, PhyloSeq67, vegan68 and 
ggplot269 packages. Data was filtered for low-abundance OTUs by removal of OTUs 
present in fewer than 3 of the 48 samples and with a relative abundance across all 
samples 0.005%. Analyses in R were performed with an average of 51,912 ± 
 15,173 
(s.d.) sequences per sample after filtering. For bacteria, differential abundance 
 
analysis we normalized read counts with metagenomeSeq66 using cumulative-sum 
scaling. Statistical analysis was performed on data filtered based on effective sample 
sizes where taxa were not included if they had fewer than X effective number of 
positive samples, where X is the median of estimated effective samples per feature 
calculated using metagenomeSeq.
All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with national Danish 
guidelines (Amendment #1306 of 23 November 2007) as approved by the Danish 
Animal Inspectorate, Ministry of Justice, permission #2014-15-2934-01027. Mice 
were kept under specific-pathogen-free conditions and experimental protocols 
were validated by in-house standard operation procedures.
Statistical analysis. Apart from the mouse experiment, in which Graphpad Prism 
version 6, Treestar, was used, all statistical analyses were performed in the  
statistical 
computing language R70. As the non-diabetic study sample comprised both non-
obese and obese individuals, a number of the physiological variables were not 
 
normally distributed (Extended Data Fig. 1). Consequently, non-parametric tests 
were applied in the statistical analysis. For all analyses involving microbiome 
data, we only included microbial species and KOs present in at least three non- 
diabetic individuals to avoid artefactual results. All comparisons with a Benjamini–
Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) < 
0.1 were considered significantly different 
throughout the analysis. To focus the analysis on phenotype- 
relevant variables, 
we employed an initial filtering of significant phenotype association of the serum 
metabolite clusters, microbial species and microbiome-derived KEGG modules 
(Fig. 1b). Serum metabolite clusters and species associations with HOMA-IR 
were conducted with a Spearman rank correlation test. Partial Spearman rank 
 
correlation tests71 were used to adjust the correlations for BMI (HOMA-IRBMIadj), 
or gene richness (HOMA-IRGeneRichness.adj) where applicable, using the ppcor 
 
R package72. Serum metabolite clusters and species abundance differences between 
individuals with and without metabolic syndrome were tested with a Mann–
Whitney U-test. We focused the downstream analysis on the serum metabolite 
clusters associated with all three phenotypes (HOMA-IR, HOMA-IRBMIadj and 
metabolic syndrome), but other metabolite clusters were significantly  
associated 
with one or more of the three phenotypes that were not retained for further 
study. Owing to the low number of microbiome functional modules and species 
 
associated with all three phenotypes, we included all functional modules and 
species associated with HOMA-IR, HOMA-IRBMIadj or metabolic syndrome in 
further analysis.
All associations for microbial functional modules were identified using a Mann–
Whitney U-test, where the ranks of KOs within a given KEGG  
functional  
module 
were compared with the ranks of all other KOs. For associations of  
microbial 
 
functional modules with HOMA-IR, gene richness and serum  
metabolite  
clusters 
the ranks were based on Spearman correlation coefficients, whereas partial 
Spearman correlation coefficients were used to rank KOs for association with 
HOMA-IRBMIadj, and HOMA-IRGeneRichness.adj, as it allows adjusting for BMI and 
gene richness, respectively. To quantify the shift in (partial) Spearman correlation 
for a given KEGG module compared to the background distribution, we  
calculated 
the background adjusted median Spearman correlation (SCCbg.adj) for a given 
KEGG module m as:

where SCCKO is the (partial) Spearman correlation coefficient between the KO 
and HOMA-IR, HOMA-IRBMIadj, HOMA-IRGeneRichness.adj, gene richness or 
serum metabolite clusters. For associations of microbial functional modules with 
 
metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, the ranks were based on Wald statistics 
for testing differentially abundant KOs with a negative binomial test, using the 
DESeq2 R package73. In contrast to all other tests, analyses using the negative 
binomial test were based on the non-rarefied gene counts.
To identify the main microbial species driving the association between 
 
functional KEGG modules and HOMA-IR described above, the calculation of the 
KO gene group abundance profiles was iterated excluding the genes from a  
different 
species, in each iteration (leave-one-out analysis). The effect of a given species on 
a specified association was defined as the change in median Spearman correlation 
coefficient between KOs and HOMA-IR when genes from the  
respective species 
were left out (DeltaSCC), that is, for species s and KEGG module m:

When testing whether regression slopes were significantly different we used the 
z score as suggested by Paternoster et al.74 and converted it to a P value using a 
2-sided t distribution.
For analysis of the data from the mouse intervention, the repeated blood 
 
glucose measurements from the OGTT were compared between the two groups 
of mice using repeated measurements two-way ANOVA, Tukey’s post hoc test 
(Sigmaplot). The area under the curve (AUC) (GraphPad) was compared using 
a Mann–Whitney U-test (GraphPad). The effect of the P. copri gavage challenge 
on the combined BCAA measures (leucine, isoleucine and valine) was tested on 
log-transformed metabolite values using a likelihood ratio test (linear model 
using generalized least squares), which does not assume independence between 
the amino acid measurements from the same mouse. For this, the variances of the 
three amino acids were modelled independently. To test for differences in the gut 
microbiota composition between sham and P. copri-gavaged mice we performed 
adonis test on the 16S data using weighted UniFrac distance. To test for bacteria 
families differentially abundant between sham and P. copri-gavaged mice we used 
the fitZig function in the metagenomeSeq R package66.

Extended Data Figure 9 | An in-depth view of the microbial BCAA 
biosynthesis pathway and BCAA inward transport system, illustrating 
the correlations between microbial KEGG orthologous gene groups and 
serum metabolites with human insulin resistance. KEGG orthologous 
gene groups (squares) and metabolites (circles) are coloured by their 
Spearman correlation with HOMA-IR in the non-diabetic individuals 
(n = 277 for KEGG orthologous gene groups, n = 291 for metabolites), 
or coloured grey if no information was available. The network is adapted 
from KEGG pathway maps (pathways hsa00290 and hsa02010).

Extended Data Figure 10 | Oral glucose tolerance test after two weeks  
of P. copri or sham gavaging and 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing of  
faecal samples from mice after three weeks of treatment with P.copri  
or sham. a, Oral glucose tolerance test. The P. copri-gavaged mice (n = 12) 
had significantly higher serum glucose levels compared to sham-gavaged 
controls (n = 12, P = 0.02, Mann–Whitney U-test for AUC) after two 
weeks of the gavage challenge. Mean ± s.e.m. is depicted. Stars indicate 
significant differences at individual time points (repeated measurements 
two-way ANOVA): * 
P < 0.05; * 
* 
P < 0.01. b, Plasma insulin was measured 
before and 15 min post glucose bolus, P = 0.80, Mann–Whitney U-test, 
bars represents mean ± s.e.m., n = 12. c, Microbiota taxa summary plots 
on family level after the two given time points, that is, pre high-fat diet 
(HFD) and post HFD plus gavage. HFD feeding significantly changed 
the microbial community (adonis P = 0.001) while bacterial gavaging 
had negligible effect. Data represent mean values. n = 12 per group 
(one sample from the sham group at time point − 
3 weeks did not go 
successfully through the 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing and is therefore 
represented by 11 samples). ‘Unclassified’ refers to reads that could not 
be classified to any taxonomy. ‘Other’ refers to reads that could not be 
classified at family level. d, P. copri changes in mouse faecal samples  
after P. copri gavaging as determined by quantitative PCR. Bars show  
the change in P. copri levels relative to before P. copri or sham challenge  
(bars represents mean ± s.e.m., n = 12, P = 0.0058, Mann–Whitney  
U-test).
