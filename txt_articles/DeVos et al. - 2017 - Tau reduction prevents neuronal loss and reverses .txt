Abstract
Accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau directly correlates with cognitive decline in 
Alzheimer’s disease and other primary tauopathies. One therapeutic strategy may be to reduce 
total tau expression. We identified antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that selectively decreased 
human tau mRNA and protein in mice expressing mutant P301S human tau. Following reduction 
of human tau in this mouse model of tauopathy, fewer tau inclusions developed and pre-existing 
phosphorylated tau and thioflavin S pathology was reversed. The resolution of tau pathology was 
accompanied by the prevention of hippocampal volume loss, neuronal death, and nesting deficits. 
In addition, mouse survival was extended and pathological tau seeding was reversed. In non-
human primates, tau ASOs distributed throughout the brain and spinal cord and reduced tau 
mRNA and protein in the brain, spinal cord, and cerebrospinal fluid. These data support

 investigation of a tau lowering therapy in human patients who have tau-positive inclusions, even 
after pathological tau deposition has begun.
Introduction
Tau is a microtubule-associated protein capable of binding to microtubules in the neuron, but 
when subjected to pathogenic conditions, aggregates and toxic oligomers form resulting in 
intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). An early histopathologic marker of 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the presence of NFTs in the entorhinal cortex that appear to 
traverse through the brain along neural networks to the hippocampus, neocortex, and 
ultimately the rest of the brain (1). Damage to these neuronal connections is hypothesized to 
underlie memory loss in AD patients and may be one of the first steps towards widespread 
neuronal loss and dementia (2).
The close correlation between tau deposition and cognitive decline (3) along with genetic 
evidence that tau mutations cause widespread neurodegeneration in patients with 
frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) strongly 
support the development of therapies targeting tau. Whereas several therapies have been 
tested that target the tau disease pathway---such as, disrupting tau misfolding (4), targeting 
tau acetylation (5), inhibiting tau-induced proteasome impairment (6), and tau 
immunotherapy (7–11)---none of these target tau mRNA with the goal of reducing total 
human tau expression. In mice, genetic ablation of endogenous tau is well tolerated with a 
minor motor phenotype developing only after 12–16 months (12–14). Our group has 
previously shown that endogenous murine tau reduction in adult mice results in no 
behavioral or neuroanatomical abnormalities, supporting the viability of a tau lowering 
therapy (15).
To study the therapeutic effects of a human tau reduction strategy in a mouse model of 
human tauopathy, we developed antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that selectively reduced 
human tau expression throughout the adult mouse brain. Similar ASO mRNA-targeted 
approaches have improved disease phenotypes in rat models of superoxide dismutase 1 
(SOD1)-related ALS (17), mouse models of Huntington’s disease (18) and FTDP-17 (19), 
and in C9ORF72 patient-derived cell lines (20, 21). Administering SOD1 ASOs into the 
CNS of human ALS patients via the CSF has been well tolerated (22). We tested these tau-
reducing ASOs in PS19 mice carrying human tau with the P301S mutation (16), and found 
beneficial effects on tau deposition, neuronal survival, tau seeding, and mouse survival.
Results
Human Tau Antisense Oligonucleotides Reduce Human Tau mRNA in mice
Human tau ASOs were designed to be specific for human tau and targeted the coding 1N4R 
transgene of human tau expressed in the PS19 mouse model, which expresses human tau 
carrying the P301S mutation (16). Before testing human tau ASOs, we tested whether a 
scrambled ASO with the same chemistry would alter human tau or murine tau mRNA 
expression at several time points after ASO administration. PS19 mice treated with saline

 vehicle or scrambled ASO (30ug/day for 28 days; total 840μg) were tested at 4, 8, and 12 
weeks after implantation of a pump for ASO delivery and both human atu and murine tau 
mRNA was measured. No significant differences were seen at any of the time points for 
either human tau (one-way ANOVA, Sidak post-hoc: 4wk p=0.968, 8wk p=0.926, 12wk 
p=0.331) or murine tau mRNA (one-way ANOVA, Sidak post-hoc: 4wk p=0.948, 8wk 
p=0.824, 12wk p=0.501) (Fig. S1).
We next tested the duration of action of the human tau-specific ASO (TauASO-12) in 
preparation for a three month treatment to reduce human tau. Alzet osmotic pumps were 
implanted in PS19 mice, allowing for slow infusion of a control [saline vehicle or 30μg/day 
(total 840μg) scrambled ASO] treatment (4wk n=10; 8wk n=5; 12wk n=8) or 30μg/day (total 
840μg) TauASO-12 human tau reduction treatment (4wk n=3; 8wk n=5; 12wk n=11) for 28 
days. Total human tau mRNA was significantly reduced at 4, 8, and 12 weeks post-pump 
implantation in TauASO-12 treated mice (Fig. 1A) (two-way ANOVA F1,43=22.96, p<0.0001, 
Bonferroni post-hoc: 4wk p=0.0250, 8wk p=0.0448, 12wk p<0.0001). Murine tau mRNA 
was not significantly altered (Fig. 1B) (two-way ANOVA F1,43=1.27, p=0.267, Bonferroni 
post-hoc: 4wk p=0.265, 8wk p>0.999, 12wk p>0.999). There was no difference in either 
human tau (two-tailed student t-test, p=0.703) or murine tau (two-tailed student t-test, 
p=0.496) mRNA between saline and scrambled ASO control treatments, and thus these 
values were combined as single control values. The long duration of target mRNA reduction 
seen here corresponds with studies using similar RNase-H ASOs (15, 18). Thus, a one-
month infusion of scrambled ASO or TauASO-12 at 30μg/day was selected in all subsequent 
studies in order to ensure 12 weeks of human tau mRNA reduction.
ASOs Are Distributed Throughout the Adult Murine Brain
After one month of saline or ASO infusion at 30μg/day followed by an 8 week washout 
period, mouse brains were stained for the ASO itself using an antibody that recognized the 
backbone chemistry of ASOs, regardless of sequence (15, 18). TauASO-12 diffused 
throughout the mouse brain and visibly persisted to the end of the 12-week treatment period 
(Fig. 1C; Fig. S2) (15, 18).
Tau ASO Treatment Prevents AT8-positive Tau Deposition
Tau pathology first deposits at 5–6 months of age in PS19 mice. To assess whether 
TauASO-12 can prevent pathology from developing, scrambled ASO (n=5) or TauASO-12 
(n=10) was administered at 6 months of age. Pumps were removed 1 month after 
implantation, and mouse brain tissue was collected 2 months later. Age-matched non-
transgenic littermate controls were treated with scrambled ASO (n=7). Human tau mRNA 
(one-way ANOVA, Sidak post-hoc p=0.004; Fig. S3A) and human tau protein (one-way 
ANOVA, Sidak post-hoc p=0.011; Fig. 1D) was significantly reduced in the TauASO-12 
group compared to the scrambled control group. Brains were then stained with the phospho-
tau antibody AT8. PS19 mice treated with scrambled ASO showed extensive AT8-positive 
tau deposition by 9 months of age, particularly in the hippocampus and entorhinal/piriform 
cortex (Fig. 1G,H). TauASO-12 treatment greatly reduced the amount of AT8 tau pathology 
deposition in the hippocampus (one-way ANOVA, Sidak post-hoc p=0.0003) (Fig. 1E, I) and 
in whole brain sections (one-way ANOVA, Sidak post-hoc p=0.008) (Fig. 1F, J).

 Tau ASO Treatment Reverses Tau Inclusions in Aged PS19 Mice
To test whether reducing total human tau could reverse pre-existing tau aggregates, we 
treated aged 9 month old PS19 mice with 30μg/day Scrambled (n=6) or TauASO-12 (n=6) 
ASO for 1 month, followed by a 2 month washout period (non-transgenic control group, 
n=5). In this older cohort, human tau mRNA (p=0.0003, one-way ANOVA, Sidak post-hoc; 
Fig. S3B) as well as total human tau protein was significantly reduced after TauASO-12 
treatment (p=0.024, one-way ANOVA, Sidak post-hoc; Fig. 2A). Further, we examined 
sarkosyl insoluble tau and found a significant decrease in total insoluble tau in TauASO-12 
treated aged PS19 mice (p=0.006, two-tailed t-test) (Fig. 2B, C). The lysate was further 
analyzed using semi-denaturing detergent agarose gel electrophoresis (SDD-AGE) to 
determine if high molecular weight (HMW) tau oligomers were also reduced. Lysate from 
9–12 month old treated PS19 mice was run on SDD-AGE and probed for total tau and 
PHF-1 positive phospho-tau (recognizing pS396/pS404) (Fig. 2D–H). There was a reduction 
in total HMW tau oligomers (p=0.004, two-tailed t-test) and phospho-tau (p=0.0104, two-
tailed t-test) in the TauASO-12 treated mice.
PS19 mice at 9 months of age also showed extensive AT8 tau pathology throughout the 
hippocampus and cortex. This baseline pathology enabled a direct comparison of 9–12 
month old treated mice with the 9 month starting point to determine if tau pathology could 
be reversed. 9–12 month old PS19 mice treated with TauASO-12 showed substantially less 
AT8 staining in the hippocampus and the whole brain compared to both age-matched 12 
month old PS19 mice treated with scrambled ASO and untreated mice (one-way ANOVA, 
Sidak post-hoc: hippocampus p<0.0001, whole brain p<0.0001), as well as the 9 month old 
PS19 mice starting group (one-way ANOVA, Sidak post-hoc: hippocampus p=0.028, whole 
brain p=0.011) (Fig. 2I–P; Fig. S4). These data suggested that when total human tau was 
reduced, pre-existing neuronal tau could be cleared from neurons in vivo. When stained for 
neurofibrillary tangles using Thioflavin S, a similar pattern emerged with TauASO-12 treated 
PS19 mice showing a reversal of neurofibrillary tangle pathology (one-way ANOVA, Sidak 
post-hoc: 9–12 PS19 ASO-12 vs 6–9 PS19 Scrambled ASO p=0.0486; 9–12 PS19 ASO-12 
vs 9–12 PS19 Scrambled ASO p=0.0078) (Fig. 2Q; quantification, Fig. S5).
In addition to measuring tau pathology burden, we stained for glial fibrillary acidic protein 
(GFAP) as a means to assess inflammation. Inflammation has been implicated in the 
pathogenesis of AD (23, 24) and the PS19 mouse model has been shown to develop an age-
dependent increase in the activation of astrocytes and GFAP expression (16, 25). In PS19 
mice treated with TauASO-12, GFAP staining was substantially reduced as compared to 12 
month old untreated PS19 mice (Fig. S6A–C).
Hippocampal Volume and Neuronal Loss are Prevented After Human Tau Reduction
PS19 mice show an age-dependent decrease in total hippocampal volume and increase in 
hippocampal neuron loss (7, 16), first evident at 9 months of age. In 9–12 month old 
TauASO-12 treated PS19 mice, further hippocampal volume and entorhinal cortex area loss 
was prevented when compared to 9–12 month old PS19 mice treated with Scrambled ASO 
(hippocampus: p=0.009 one-way ANOVA, Sidak post-hoc; entorhinal cortex: p<0.0001 one-
way ANOVA, Sidak post-hoc) (Fig. 3A, C; Fig. S7). To determine whether prevention of

 hippocampal volume loss was secondary to prevention of neuronal loss, we counted DAPI 
(blue) and NeuN (red; a marker for neurons) dual positive cells in the CA1 region of the 
hippocampus (Fig. 3B, D) and cell size area in CA1 (Fig. S8). We confirmed prevention of 
further neuronal loss as measured by NeuN positive cell counts in the hippocampus 
following treatment with TauASO-12 in aged PS19 mice (DAPI and NeuN dual positive cells: 
p=0.005 one-way ANOVA, Sidak post-hoc; cell size: p<0.0001 one-way ANOVA, Sidak 
post-hoc).
Reducing Human Tau Prevents and Reverses Tau Seeding Capability
Recent studies have demonstrated the ability of tau to propagate from one cell to another in 
vitro (26) and from one brain region to another along synaptically-connected networks in 
vivo (27, 28). This tau “spreading” may be a mechanism for disease progression in AD and 
other tauopathies (29). One in vitro measure of the ability of pathological tau aggregates to 
induce misfolding of naïve monomeric tau, i.e. tau “seeding” activity, is a cell-based assay 
that relies on flow cytometry detection of Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) created 
by intracellular aggregation of endogenously expressed repeat domain of tau (TauRD) fused 
with cyan fluorescent protein (TauRD-CFP) and yellow fluorescent protein (TauRD-YFP) in 
stably expressing human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells (30, 31) (Fig. 4A). Using 
TauRD-CFP/TauRD-YFP expressing HEK-293 cells, in non-transfected cells or cells treated 
with non-transgenic brain homogenate lysate, only diffuse homogenous background 
fluorescence and no FRET-positive inclusions were seen (Fig. 4B, C). Upon addition of 
brain lysate from the 6–9 month old and 9–12 month old PS19 treatment cohorts, 
intracellular TauRD-CFP/TauRD-YFP aggregates were seen at 24 hours after lysate was 
applied. TauASO-12 treatment prevented tau aggregate formation in both 6–9 month old and 
9–12 month old age groups (Fig. 4D–G) (one-way ANOVA, Sidak post-hoc: 6–9 month old 
mice p<0.0001, 9–12 month old mice p=0.0061). Additionally, when compared to the 
starting age of 9 months, tau seeding activity was reversed in the 9–12 month old PS19 
cohort treated with TauASO-12 (p=0.044 one-way ANOVA, Sidak post-hoc) (Fig. 4H). These 
data demonstrate that tau seeding activity is substantially reduced and partially reversed by 
treatment with tau ASO.
Lowering Human Tau Prolongs Mouse Survival and Rescues Nesting Deficits
Hind limb paralysis in PS19 mice begins around 9–10 months of age, leading to shortened 
survival time (16). We treated 9 month old PS19 mice with either Scrambled ASO or 
TauASO-12 in the same treatment approach as for the 9–12 month old cohort to determine if 
survival could be extended, even in this older cohort (n=17 per treatment). Mice were 
sacrificed when they could not flip over in 30 seconds. Despite this late treatment strategy, 
TauASO-12 treated mice lived significantly longer than age-matched controls treated with 
scrambled ASO (Mantel-Cox Survival, p=0.0052; Median survival, scrambled: 312 days, 
TauASO-12: 348 days) (Fig. 5A).
In addition to survival, we assessed the ability of treated PS19 mice to complete a functional 
task. We sought to test the functionality of the mice and found nest building performance a 
robust and reliable readout of general performance in PS19 mice. In mouse models, 
instinctual nest building behavior is used to jointly assess general social behavior, cognitive

 performance, and motor capabilities. Deficits in nesting activity are evident in mouse models 
of tauopathy (34), suggesting that accumulation of tau can induce deficits in nesting 
practices. Mouse nesting deficits are characterized by incomplete nests (low nest score) and 
high untorn weight of the nestlet (3 gram piece of pressed cotton). 8–9 month old PS19 mice 
were treated with saline (n=11), scrambled ASO (n=11), or TauASO-12 (n=25) at 30μg/day 
for 4 weeks and then the implanted Alzet osmotic pumps were removed. Six weeks after 
pump removal, nesting activity was assessed. No significant difference was seen between 
PS19 mice treated with saline and scrambled ASO, so these data were combined (nestlet 
weight: Two-tailed student t-test, p=0.366; nestlet score: Two-tailed Mann Whitney, 
p=0.311). Mice treated with TauASO-12 performed significantly better on the nestlet task, 
both making better nests (p=0.040 Kruskal-Wallis, Dunn’s post-hoc) and leaving less untorn 
nestlet weight behind (p=0.014 one-way ANOVA, Sidak post-hoc) (Fig. 5B, C). Functional 
deficits as depicted by survival and nesting activity in aged PS19 mice served as a practical 
alternative for traditional cognitive performance and could be rescued by reducing total 
human tau in vivo (Fig. 5A–C).
Tau ASOs Reduce Tau in a Non-Human Primate
Cynomologus monkeys were treated with an ASO complementary to monkey tau. All 
monkeys were 2–8 years old at the start of treatment. Artificial cerebrospinal fluid – a 
solution made to mimic the molecular composition of biological cerebrospinal fluid – (n=4) 
or the ASO was delivered in a single bolus via lumbar puncture into the intrathecal space at 
doses of 30mg (n=3) or 50mg (n=3) and the brains and spinal cords were collected two 
weeks later (Fig. 6A). Total tau mRNA was decreased across the spinal cord and brain in a 
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6B). Next, we looked at tau mRNA and protein in the brain 
and spinal cord after both a short (2 weeks; n=4 per treatment) and long (6 weeks; n=4 per 
treatment) duration post initial dose. An initial intrathecal bolus of 10mg ASO was 
delivered, followed by a second 30mg ASO intrathecal bolus one week later (Fig. 6C). At 
two weeks after ASO treatment, tau mRNA was effectively decreased (Fig. 6D). Protein was 
also decreased, though not to the same degree, likely due to the long half-life of tau (35) 
(Fig. 6E). The longer six week duration showed both continued tau mRNA reduction as well 
as improved tau protein reduction compared to the two week duration (Fig. 6D, E). Despite 
delivery of the ASO as a bolus in the intrathecal space, tau was suppressed just as efficiently 
in the entire hippocampus as it was in the cervical portion of the spinal cord, demonstrating 
widespread intrathecal delivery of ASO in the brain of a larger mammalian species.
Finally, we tested the effect of the ASO on tau protein in the cerebrospinal fluid as a possible 
marker to monitor therapeutic efficacy (36). Non-human primates were dosed with 10mg 
ASO via intrathecal bolus injection, followed one week later by a 30mg ASO bolus. Brains 
and spinal cords were collected 5 weeks after the initial dose. Tau protein in the 
cerebrospinal fluid was measured both before dosing and at necropsy (Fig. 6F) (n=4 per 
treatment). Tau protein reduction in the spinal cord and in the frontal cortex, temporal 
cortex, and hippocampus was confirmed (Fig. 6G). Using the individual animal’s pre-dosing 
cerebrospinal fluid tau as a baseline, tau protein in the cerebrospinal fluid was found to be 
decreased following tau ASO treatment (Fig. 6H). Cerebrospinal fluid tau correlated directly

 with tau protein in the hippocampus (p=0.01, R2=0.68, Linear Regression, Fig. 6J; for other 
regions see Fig. S9), one of the major affected regions in the AD brain.
Discussion
Using antisense oligonucleotides specifically directed against human tau in the PS19 
tauopathy mouse model at 6 and 9 months of age, we found a marked decrease and even 
reversal of phosphorylated AT8 tau pathology across the brain despite the age at treatment 
(Figs. 1 and 2). Tau knockdown treatment also halted hippocampal and neuronal loss (Fig. 
3), reversed tau seeding activity (Fig. 4), and protected against deficits in survival and 
nesting behavior (Fig. 5). When tested in non-human primates, tau ASOs targeting monkey 
tau were highly efficacious at reducing endogenous tau mRNA and protein throughout the 
brain, spinal cord, and cerebrospinal fluid after intrathecal dosing (Fig. 6). Combined, these 
data support the use of a tau lowering therapy for human patients with tauopathies.
Previous studies have similarly identified reductions and even reversal of pathological tau 
lesions (37) and memory improvement (38) through suppression of the mutant tau gene by 
doxycycline administration in Tg4510 mice. Despite their overall less severe phenotype 
compared to the Tg4510 model, PS19 mice do develop Thioflavin-S positivity and 
neurofibrillary tangle pathology in the brain (16) consistent with tau deposition seen in 
postmortem human brain tissue. The reversal of tau pathology by ASO-mediated reduction 
of human tau in PS19 mice is not only consistent with previous studies using a regulated 
transgene, but also shows the therapeutic potential for tau-targeted strategies by 
demonstrating reduction in tau seeding activity and rescue of neuronal loss in a clinically-
relevant tauopathy mouse model. Interestingly, despite there being more tau aggregates in 
the 9–12 month old treated PS19 cohort compared to the 6–9 month old animals, seeding 
activity was reduced equally in both groups. We do not know whether this represents 
biological variability or reflects underlying important biology suggesting that ASOs have an 
overall greater impact on seeding at the later 9–12 month time point. Whereas tau pathology 
can still be clearly measured, unfortunately a less severe tauopathy mouse model limits 
complete assessment of behavioral outcomes, as others have failed to see significant 
differences in some of these more classic cognitive tests, such as the Morris Water Maze and 
Contextual Fear behavior (32, 33). Despite the absence of changes in cognition on 
traditional tests, PS19 mice demonstrated functional decline evident in nesting activity 
deficits and premature death, which were both prevented by tau lowering ASO treatment.
A major question in developing therapeutics for symptomatic neurodegenerative disease is 
whether the disease can be substantially slowed or even improved once the degenerative 
disease process has already begun. By the time most patients with tauopathy come to the 
clinic with symptoms, tau inclusions most likely have already begun to be deposited. Several 
reports describe using genetic tools to reverse neurodegeneration in animal models (18, 39). 
With our readily translatable human ASO therapeutic, we were able to reverse pathological 
changes and prevent neuronal loss, improve behavioral deficits and extend survival in PS19 
mice. The fact that pathology reversal can be achieved should perhaps not be too surprising. 
Dominantly inherited forms of neurodegenerative diseases caused by mutations in tau, 
SOD1, huntingtin or other proteins are all highly age-dependent, suggesting mechanisms

 early in life may adequately mitigate the effects of these disease-causing mutant proteins and 
delay disease onset.
By definition, primary tauopathies include those with disease causing mutations in tau in 
addition to Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD), and 
Pick’s Disease. However, genetic tau data for PSP suggests that tau is, at least partially, 
causative in these disorders rather than solely a pathologic hallmark (40). With recent 
advances in PSP human clinical trials, lowering tau in PSP would be an excellent first 
application of this tau ASO strategy (41, 42). Further, in approximately 40% of 
Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) cases, tau is the primary pathology (43). Though still in the 
early characterization stages, we anticipate that tau positron emission tomography (PET) 
ligands will, in the near future, help distinguish FTD with tau from other FTD cases and thus 
enable a tau-focused therapeutic trial in the FTD patient population (44). In addition to a 
primary tauopathy diagnosis and tau PET imaging, genetic tests could be used to identify 
patients with a tau mutation, or the H1 tau haplotype (45), or tau specific SNPs that increase 
tau expression (46, 47), or other genetic polymorphisms such as the rs1768208 T-allele (48) 
or PIN1 (49), which are linked to greater tau deposition, as a possible means to determine 
who may qualify for a tau lowering treatment.
While several different primary tauopathy disorders exist, including PSP and FTD, the most 
common tauopathy is AD. In AD, tau burden appears to directly correlate with disease 
progression and cognitive decline (3). However, one of the major issues in considering 
treating AD with a tau-modifying therapy is the ongoing deposition of amyloid-beta (Aβ). 
Some data suggest that Aβ toxicity is partially mediated through tau (50–52) as the tau 
knockout mouse has proven to be protected against a growing number of Aβ-induced 
insults, including those affecting cognition (50, 53), seizures (14, 50, 51, 54, 55), survival 
(50, 51, 54), axonal transport (52), and double-stranded breaks in DNA (55). Thus, there is 
still potential for treating AD with a human tau ASO therapy. One of the surprising findings 
when looking at the effects of tau reduction in mouse models of Aβ deposition was the 
importance of tau in neuronal hyperexcitability. Our previous work emphasized this point by 
demonstrating that lowering tau in adult mice with a tau ASO was also protective against 
seizures (15). While traditional oral antiepileptic drugs will remain the mainstay for treating 
most seizure disorders, for some epilepsies with poor responses to these medications, 
lowering tau may be a viable consideration.
Another key consideration for testing tau lowering therapy in human clinical trials will be 
the safety of reducing total levels of tau since tau is an abundant and likely important protein 
in the nervous system. Surprisingly, mice that completely lack tau have proven to be 
phenotypically normal in terms of learning/memory and general cognition (13, 14, 50) with 
a minor motor phenotype developing later in life, the severity of which varies (12–14, 56). 
Importantly, when endogenous murine tau is reduced in adult mice, no deviations from 
baseline are seen in any sensory, motor, or cognitive behavior task (15), adding support to 
the safety of reducing tau in the adult mammalian brain. Given that tau ASOs also 
effectively reduce monkey tau (Fig. 6), important toxicology work can now be done to 
determine the safety of reducing tau in nonhuman primates to help further assess the risks of 
tau lowering in humans. Future preclinical studies would also benefit from measurements of

 tau and phosphorylated-tau in the CSF following ASO-mediated tau reduction as these 
assessments are already being employed as markers of disease in human patients.
It is important to note the limitations associated with this study. While we predict that 
lowering tau with antisense oligonucleotides in any tauopathy model would show similar 
benefit, our study here was restricted to the PS19 mouse model of tauopathy (16). To achieve 
rapid pathology in mice, the tau transgene is both mutated with a TauP301S point mutation 
and expressed at high levels. Thus, it is possible that some of the effects seen here are 
associated with artificially high expression of a mutant form of tau, an important caveat 
when considering treating those AD patients that have neither a tau mutation nor tau 
overexpression. Additionally, correlating behavioral changes in mice with cognitive deficits 
in humans is challenging and it remains unclear how the benefits we observed here will 
translate to humans. And lastly, while previous ASO studies in humans are encouraging, the 
ASOs used here need to be fully tested in formal toxicology studies before they can advance 
towards human clinical trials.
The preclinical tau reduction work presented here, in conjunction with our previous murine 
tau ASO data (15), set the stage for translating a tau ASO program into the clinic. A similar 
ASO strategy targeting SOD1 resulted in extended survival in a rat model of ALS (17). A 
recently completed Phase I clinical trial in human ALS patients demonstrated that CSF 
delivery of human SOD1 ASOs had an excellent safety profile (22); a subsequent Phase I/II 
clinical trial is now underway (clinicaltrials.gov #NCY02623699). Further, ASOs against the 
mutant spinal motor neuron (SMN) mRNA that rescued rodent Spinal Muscular Atrophy 
(SMA) models (57) just completed Phase III studies for children with SMA and has been 
approved by the Federal Drug Administration (58). ASOs against mutant human huntingtin 
that successfully treated mouse models of Huntington’s disease (18) are now in human 
clinical trials as well. These in vivo preclinical and early clinical ASO studies, together with 
the pre-clinical data presented here, strengthen the case for a human tau reduction 
therapeutic approach for patients with PSP, FTD, AD, and other tauopathies.
Materials and Methods
Study Design
The goal of the study was to treat adult PS19 mice with a human tau lowering antisense 
oligonucleotide (ASO) and analyze the effects of tau reduction on tau pathology, 
inflammation, neuronal loss, tau seeding, and functional behavior. The first portion of the 
study focused on treatment with TauASO-12 directed against human tau and used PS19 mice 
– a tauopathy mouse model that overexpresses a mutant form of human tau – and their non-
transgenic littermate controls. For all studies, mice were litter-matched, age-matched, and 
gender matched to keep the treatment groups as similar as possible. Except for the duration 
of action study where the mice were euthanized at different time points, all studies were pre-
determined to last three months from pump implantation. Each age group – 6–9 month old 
and 9–12 month old – was processed together and all brains across both age groups were 
stained and imaged at the same time. The tau seeding assay was carried out in human 
embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells that stably expressed the repeat domain of tau (TauRD) 
fused with CFP and TauRD fused with YFP (30). Sample sizes were chosen based both on

 previous experience with tau ASOs in the lab as well as therapeutic studies carried out by 
others using the same PS19 mouse line. The tau seeding analyses, quantification of AT8 
staining, hippocampal and entorhinal volume, NeuN/DAPI counts, cell size analysis, 
survival, and nestlet behavior were all carried out blinded. The last part of the study used 
Cynomologus non-human primates (n=34 total) to determine the extent of tau mRNA and 
protein reduction following a lumbar infusion of tau ASO in a large mammal.
Animals
The PS19 mice were created using a 1N4R tau cDNA with a TauP301S mutation resulting in 
5-fold greater human tau expression over endogenous mouse tau (16). Breeding pairs were 
purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and resulting progenies were maintained on a B6C3 
background. All non-transgenics used were littermates of PS19 mice. All studies were 
performed using gender-balanced groups. Mice had access to food and water ad libitum and 
were housed on a 12 hour light:dark cycle. Experiments involving animals were approved by 
the Animal Studies Committee at Washington University in St. Louis.
Antisense Oligonucleotides
The ASOs used have the following modifications: five nucleotides on the 5′- and 3′-termini 
containing 2′-O-methoxyethyl modifications and 10 unmodified central 
oligodeoxynucleotides to support RNaseH activity and a phosphorothioate backbone to 
improve nuclease resistance and promote cellular uptake (59). ASOs were synthesized as 
previously described (60) and solubilized in 0.9% sterile saline immediately prior to use. For 
murine use: TauASO-12 sequence – 5′ GCTTTTACTGACCATGCGAG 3′; Scrambled 
sequence – 5′ CCTTCCCTGAAGGTTCCTCC 3′. For Non-Human Primate work: Tau 
ASO sequence – 5′ CCGTTTTCTTACCACCCT 3′.
Surgical Placement of Intracerebroventricular (ICV) Pumps and Tissue Collection
As previously described, (17, 61) mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and 28 day 
osmotic pumps (ALZET) with ASO were implanted in a subcutaneous pocket formed on the 
back of the mouse. The catheter was placed in the right lateral ventricle with following 
coordinates based on bregma: −0.5mm Posterior, −1.1mm Lateral (right), −2.5mm Ventral. 
For tissue collection, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused using chilled 
PBS-heparin. Brain tissue was rapidly removed and the right hemisphere (ipsilateral to the 
pump catheter placement) was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C while the 
left hemisphere (contralateral to the catheter placement) was post-fixed in 4% 
paraformaldehyde at 4°C and transferred to 30% sucrose 24 hours later. All animal protocols 
were approved by the Washington University in St. Louis Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee.
Quantitative Real-Time PCR
RNA analyses were performed using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Total RNA was 
extracted from brain tissue using a QIAGEN RNeasy Kit (QIAGEN). For total tau analyses, 
RNA was reverse transcribed and amplified using the EXPRESS One-Step Superscript qRT-
PCR Universal Kit (Invitrogen). The qRT-PCRs were run and analyzed on the ABI PRISM

Tau ELISA Analysis
Tissues were homogenized in RAB buffer [100mM MES, 1mM EDTA, 0.5mM MgSO4, 
750mM NaCl, 20mM NaF, 1mM Na3VO4, supplemented with protease inhibitor (Complete, 
Roche)]. Homogenate was spun at 40,000xg on an ultracentrifuge for 20mins at 4°C. 
Supernatant was collected and protein concentration measured using Pierce BCA Protein 
Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific). Total Human Tau protein levels were measured on a Tau5-
HT7 sandwich ELISA. 96-half-well plates (Nunc) were coated with the Tau-5 antibody 
(anti-mouse; Millipore) overnight at 4°C. Plates were blocked with 4% BSA for 60min at 
37°C, brain homogenate diluted in standard buffer [0.25% BSA, 300mM Tris, 0.05% azide, 
and 1X protease inhibitor in PBS] was added, and incubated overnight at 4°C. For the 
standard curve, hTau2N4R recombinant protein was used. The detection antibody 
biotinylated HT7 (anti-mouse; ThermoScientific) was added the next day followed by 
streptavidin poly-horseradish peroxidase-40 (Fitzgerald). Plates were developed using Super 
Slow ELISA TMB (Sigma) and read on an Epoch Microplate Spectrophotometer (BioTek).
Sarkosyl Insoluble Tau Analysis
The Sarkosyl extraction was carried out as previously described (62). Briefly, tissue was 
homogenized in Buffer H (20mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 0.15M NaCl, 1mM EGTA, 1mM DTT) 
with electronic hand held homogenizer and then spun at 100,000xg for 30mins at 4°C in the 
ultracentrifuge. Supernatant was removed, pellet was resuspended in Buffer H, and 
homogenized again. Samples were then incubated with 1% Triton X-100 at 37°C for 
30mins. Samples were spun at 100,000xg for 30mins at 4°C and supernatant removed. Pellet 
was resuspended in Buffer H and homogenized. Samples then incubated with 1% sarkosyl at 
37°C for 30mins. After the incubation, samples spun at 100,000xg for 30mins at 4°C. 
Supernatant removed and stored as the sarkosyl-soluble fraction. The pellet was resuspended 
in urea buffer (8M urea, 50mM Tris-HCl pH7.5) and sonicated. Samples were again spun at 
100,000xg for 30mins at 4°C. This supernatant was collected and used as the sarkosyl 
insoluble fraction. Protein concentration was measured on BCA (Peirce). 5μg of sarkosyl 
insoluble fraction and 6μg of TritonX soluble fraction was loaded onto a 4–20% SDS-PAGE 
gel and transferred to PVDF membrane. Tau13 (anti-mouse; 1:1000, Abcam) was used to 
detect total human tau on the sarkosyl insoluble blot and Actin (anti-mouse; 1:2000, Abcam) 
was used on the TritonX soluble blot as a loading control. Primary antibody was incubated 
at room temperature in 1:1 Odyssey blocking buffer:water for 3 hours. Membranes were 
washed 3X with TBS-Tween, probed with goat anti-mouse IRdye 800 (1:2000; Licor) for

 1.5 hours at RT, washed 3X in TBS-Tween and developed on the Odyssey CLx Imager 
(Licor). Bands were quantified using ImageJ software.
Semi-Denaturing Detergent Agarose Gel Electrophoresis (SDD-AGE)
The SDD-AGE protocol was carried out previously described (63) with minor modifications. 
Brain protein used for SDD-AGE analysis was collected by dounce homogenizing tissue in 
1X PBS supplemented with protease inhibitor and spun at 3,000xg for 5mins at 4°C. The 
supernatant was collected and protein concentration measured by BCA (Pierce). The gel was 
composed of 1.5% agarose dissolved in buffer G (20mM Tris-Base, 200mM glycine) and 
0.02% SDS added after the agarose was fully dissolved. Gels were cast to be 20cm long. 
50μg of total lysate was then incubated with 0.02% SDS sample buffer for 7 minutes at room 
temperature immediately prior to loading. Once loaded, the SDD-AGE was run using 
Laemmli buffer (Buffer G + 0.1% SDS) at 30V for 16 hours. The transfer was performed 
using capillary action using 20 pieces of thick Whatmann paper (GB 005) and 8 pieces of 
medium high absorbent Whatmann paper (GB 003) to Immoblin PVDF (Millipore) 
membrane at 4°C for 24 hours using 1X TBS. Following transfer, the membrane was 
blocked in Odyssey Blocking Buffer PBS (Li-cor) for 1 hour and then probed for both total 
tau (anti-rabbit; 1:4000; Abcam) and PHF-1 (anti-mouse; gift from Peter Davies, 1:5000) 
overnight at 4°C in 1:1 Odyssey blocking buffer:water. The membrane was washed 3X with 
TBS-Tween, probed with goat anti-rabbit IRdye 680 (1:2000; Licor) and goat anti-mouse 
IRdye 800 (1:2000; Licor) for 1.5 hours at room temperature, washed 3X in TBS-Tween and 
developed on the Odyssey CLx Imager (Licor). To quantify the bands, the low molecular 
weight (LMW) and high molecular weight (HMW) portions of the blot were quantified 
separately. Previous reports of HMW and LMW tau run on SDD-AGE show an 
accumulation of LMW tau at the bottom of the gel with smears of HMW tau oligomers at 
the top (7, 63–65). Using ImageJ gel quantification tool, each region – either HMW or 
LMW – was outlined and plotted. The middle empty lane was used to subtract background 
from all samples.
Immunofluorescence
Brains post-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde were sliced at 50μm on a freezing microtome. 
Brains were incubated with the primary antibodies Pan-ASO (anti-rabbit; 1:2000, Ionis), 
AT8 (anti-mouse; 1:500, Thermo Scientific), NeuN (anti-rabbit; 1:100, Abcam), or glial 
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (anti-chicken; 1:1000, Abcam) in 3% Horse Serum 1X TBS 
0.1% Triton overnight at 4°C, followed by a 1 hour incubation at room temperature with 
fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:400 anti-mouse DyLight 488, 1:400 anti-
rabbit DyLight 550, ThermoScientific). All sections were counterstained with DAPI for 5 
minutes immediately following secondary incubation, mounted onto slides, and cover 
slipped using Vectashield mounting solution (Vector Labs). Fluorescent images were 
captured using the Olympus Nanozoomer 2.0-HT (Hamamatsu) and processed using the 
NDP viewer software (Hamamatsu). All images were taken with the same fluorescent 
settings and subsequently adjusted equally for brightness and contrast to ensure accurate 
pathology quantification.

 Thioflavin S Staining
Four brain sections 300μm apart were used from each mouse. Staining for all sections 
analyzed were carried out on the same day and imaged together to reduce staining batch 
variability. 50μm fixed brain sections were mounted onto slides and dried overnight. Slides 
were then incubated with fresh/filtered 0.05% Thioflavin S in 50% ethanol for 8 minutes in 
the dark, followed by dipping in 80% ethanol for 15 seconds. Slides were washed in double 
distilled water 5 times, 5 minutes each in the dark. Sections were coverslipped with 
Vectashield mounting medium with Propidium Iodide (Vector Labs) and sealed with nail 
polish. Images were obtained using the 488 channel on an Olympus BX51 microscope 
mounted with a DP 70 Olympus digital camera. The number of ThioS positive cells were 
counted in the Piriform Cortex of each section and averaged together over the four sections 
for each mouse, resulting in one value per mouse.
Tau Pathology Quantification
All pathology quantification was carried out blinded. For AT8 pathology staining, 4 brain 
sections 300μm apart were used from each mouse. Staining for all sections analyzed were 
carried out on the same day and imaged together to reduce staining batch variability. The 
sections were used to assess the percent area covered by AT8 positive tau staining. 
Following imaging, using sections incubated only with secondary antibody, the brightness 
and contrast were adjusted using the NDP viewer software (Hamamatsu) to eliminate 
background so the AT8 positive signal could be seen more clearly. Those exact same settings 
were then applied to all subsequent image files before being exported and saved as .jpeg 
image files. The image files were opened in ImageJ, converted to 8 bit greyscale and re-
saved. Using the freehand selection tool on the greyscale images, the outline of either the 
whole brain section or the hippocampus was drawn. A uniform threshold value of 6 (using 
the dark background option) was then applied before performing the “analyze particles” task 
to determine within the outline area the percent covered by positive signal. The average 
percent coverage of all four sections was used as the final percent AT8 stained value for that 
mouse.
Hippocampal Volume and Entorhinal Cortex Analysis
All hippocampal volume and entorhinal cortex analyses were carried out blinded. Starting at 
the very beginning of the hippocampus (bregma −1.0mm), 8 sections were taken at 300μm 
apart. Sections were mounted and stained with Crystal Violet before imaging on the 
Olympus Nanozoomer 2.0-HT (Hamamatsu). Using the NDP viewer software, the 
hippocampus in each section was outlined to obtain the total hippocampal area. Each of the 
hippocampal areas was then multiplied by 300μm to obtain a final hippocampal volume in 
mm3 for each mouse. For the entorhinal cortex, only sections posterior of bregma −2.70mm 
were used. The entire cortex area ventral to the rhinal fissure was outlined and area 
measured. This area was averaged across sections to get a final entorhinal/piriform area.
DAPI Count and Cell Size Analysis
For DAPI counts, a rectangle was placed over CA1 in ImageJ. Using a macro, the same size 
rectangle was used for each section to ensure the same area. The numbers of DAPI positive

 nuclei that colocalized with the NeuN neuronal marker were blindly counted within the 
defined CA1 region. For cell size analysis, 3 sections per mouse were subjected to Crystal 
Violet staining and imaged using the Olympus Nanozoomer 2.0-HT (Hamamatsu). To 
measure cell size area, 25 adjoining cells in CA1 spanning an average of 100μm 
(approximately 8% of the total length of CA1) of the hippocampus in each section were 
outlined using the NDP viewer software at a magnification of 40X and the area of each of 
those cells was measured. The cell size area of those 25 cells was averaged for each section 
and those averages for the three sections were then averaged for each mouse, generating a 
single cell size area value for each animal.
Tau Seeding Assay
In vitro tau seeding activity was measured as previously described (30, 31). Briefly, 
HEK-293 cells stably expressing the repeat domain of Tau with the P301S mutation 
(TauRDP301S) fused with cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and TauRDP301S–yellow 
fluorescent protein (YFP) were plated in 96-well plates at 35,000 cells per well. 
Approximately 18 hours later, at 60% confluency, cells were transduced with the 
experimental PS19 brain lysate at 4μg/well. The transduction complexes were generated by 
incubating Opti-MEM (Gibco) + 4μg lysate with Opti-MEM + 1.25μL Lipofectamine 2000 
(Invitrogen) for a final volume of 20μL per well for 20 minutes at room temperature. 
Transduction complexes were added to cells for 24 hours and then cell harvested with 0.05% 
trypsin followed by post-fixing in 2% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Services) for 
10 minutes. Cells were then resuspended in flow cytometry buffer. For all flow cytometry 
measurements, the MACSQuant (Miltenyi) flow cytometer was used. CFP and FRET were 
measured by exciting cells with the 405nm laser and capturing fluorescence with the 405/50 
and 525/50nm filters, respectively. For FRET quantification, a bivariate plot of FRET vs. 
CFP was generated to assess the number of FRET-positive cells, using cells that received 
lipofectamine alone as a marker of the FRET-negative population. The integrated FRET 
density (percentage of FRET-positive cells multiplied by the median fluorescence intensity 
of FRET-positive cells) was used for all quantitative analyses. Each experiment was 
performed using 20,000 cells per replicate and each sample was analyzed in triplicate. Data 
analyses were performed with FlowJo v10 (Treestar). Representative images of tau 
aggregates in the HEK dual positive cells were taken using a confocal microscope with the 
BP 505–530 filter.
Survival Analysis
9 month old PS19 mice were treated with either scrambled ASO or TauASO-12 at 30μg/day 
for 28 days. Immediately following pump implantation, animals were monitored several 
days a week throughout the study. If a mouse showed signs of hindlimb paralysis, it was 
tested daily for its ability to right itself when placed on its back. Mice unable to flip over 
after 30 seconds were sacrificed.
Nestlet Behavior
To measure nesting capability, singly housed PS19 mice were given an intact, pre-weighed 
compressed cotton nestlet (3.0g; Ancare) in their cage. After 24 hours, pictures were taken 
of each nest and any untorn nestlets were removed, dried overnight at 37°C, and weighed. 
DeVos et al.

 Nest quality was scored on a scale of 0 to 7, with slight modifications and increased scale 
range compared to previously published criteria (66). A score of 7 is a perfect nest with no 
untorn nestlet remaining, while a score of 0 is an untouched nestlet. The untorn nestlets were 
weighed and nests scored by a blinded observer.
Non-Human Primate ASO Dosing
All non-human primate procedures were performed following animal welfare regulations of 
the institution. All non-human primates were 2–8 years old at the start of treatment. 
Intrathecal lumbar bolus injections were performed in Cynomolgus monkeys after anesthesia 
with Ketamine and Domitor (Antisedan used as an antidote). 10mg, 30mg, and 50mg doses 
of tau ASO were administered via lumbar puncture at level L3–L4 and infused over the 
course of 1 minute as a slow bolus. At the discretion of the study veterinarian, some doses 
were administered at the L5–L6 level as an alternative when the intrathecal space was not 
accessible at L3–L4. Neurological exams were performed following dosing and then again 
before necropsy. The spinal cord and brain were collected either 2 weeks, 5 weeks, or 6 
weeks post-initial treatment, depending on the study, to analyze monkey tau mRNA and 
protein in different CNS tissues. Tissue homogenates were generated from full regions of the 
spinal cord – cervical, thoracic, and lumbar – and full brain regions – frontal cortex, 
temporal cortex, and hippocampus. Monkey tau protein was also measured in CSF that was 
drawn just prior to initial dosing as well as at necropsy.
Statistics
The data were analyzed for statistical significance using the graphing program GraphPad 
Prism 6. To determine sample size for tau reduction and pathology, a pilot cohort of n=5/
treatment was analyzed and found to be sufficient to see significant differences in tau 
expression and pathology. Each study was completed with the listed number of mice in the 
figure legends. Two-tailed student t-tests were used for Sarkosyl and SDD-AGE blot 
quantifications. One-way ANOVA with Sidak post hoc analyses were used for saline vs 
scrambled mRNA analysis, total tau protein expression, AT8 pathology quantification, 
Thioflavin S pathology quantification, hippocampal volume and entorhinal area, DAPI 
counts and cell size analysis, tau seeding, nestlet weight, and monkey mRNA and protein 
analysis. For nestlet score, because the scoring was a non-ordinal scale, a Kruskal-Wallis test 
was performed with Dunn’s post hoc multiple comparison analysis. Two-way ANOVA with 
Bonferroni post hoc analyses were used for the duration of action study. A two-way repeated 
measures ANOVA with Sidak post hoc analysis was used to analyze changes in CSF tau 
protein in Cynomologus monkeys with each monkey serving as its own baseline. Linear 
regression was used for the correlations between Cynomologus CSF and Brain/Spinal Cord 
tau protein. Graphical data are represented as box and whisker plots with individual points 
overlaid, where error bars represent maximum and minimum values and the boxed line 
represents the median.

tissue was collected 2 months later. Total human tau (huTau) protein was measured. One-
way ANOVA, Sidak post hoc analysis. (B, C) Sarkosyl extraction was performed on mouse 
brain lysates and then run on western blots and probed for total human tau (antibody: Tau13) 
and actin (B). Quantification of western blots indicated less insoluble tau in PS19 mice 
treated with TauASO-12 compared to PS19 mice treated with scrambled ASO (C). Two-tailed 
Student T-test. (D, E) Mouse brain lysate was run on semi-denaturing detergent agarose gel 
electrophoresis (SDD-AGE) and probed for total tau (D) and phosphorylated-tau (PHF-1; 
pS396/pS404). (E). (F–H) SDD-AGE high molecular weight (HMW) and low molecular 
weight (LMW) bands were quantified in ImageJ. Two-tailed Student T-test. (I, J)

 Fig. 3. Reducing Human Tau Prevents Hippocampal Neuron Loss in PS19 Mice
(A, C) Brain sections systematically selected at 300μm intervals throughout the 
hippocampus were taken from 9 month old non-transgenic mice (NT) (n=6), 12 month old 
NT mice (n=6), 9 month old PS19 mice (n=10), 9–12 month old PS19 mice [both untreated 
(n=6) and treated with scrambled ASO n=6], and 9–12 month old PS19 mice treated with 
TauASO-12 (n=6). Representative images (A) and volume quantification (C) show 
hippocampal loss prevention in the TauASO-12 treatment group. (B, D) Representative 
images (B) and quantification (D) of the CA1 region of the hippocampus stained with the 
neuronal marker NeuN (red) and counterstained with the nuclear marker DAPI (blue) in a 
predefined CA1 region. 9–12 month old TauASO-12 treated PS19 mice had more DAPI 
positive neurons in CA1 than the age matched PS19 controls treated with scrambled ASO. 
One-way ANOVA, Sidak post hoc analysis. *p<0.05, **p<0.01. Graphical data are 
represented as box and whisker plots with individual points overlaid, where error bars 
represent maximum and minimum values and the boxed line represents the median.

FRET positive inclusions detected with confocal microscopy, but was reduced in sensor cells 
exposed to brain lysates from TauASO-12 treated mice in both the 6–9 month old and 9–12 
month old age groups. (H) Normalized Integrated FRET density (the percent of FRET

and normalized to cells not treated with lysate) quantitative “tau seeding” values for all 
samples. Tau seeding activity was reduced in both the 6–9 month old and 9–12 month old 
PS19 TauASO-12 treated brain lysates as compared to age-matched PS19 scrambled ASO 
treated brain lysates. Tau seeding activity in the 9–12 month old TauASO-12 treated brain 
lysate was reversed when compared to the younger 6–9 month old scrambled ASO control 
treated lysate. One-way ANOVA, Sidak post hoc analysis. *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001,

 Fig. 5. Human Tau Reduction Extends PS19 Mouse Survival and Prevents Nesting Behavioral 
Deficits
(A) 9 month old PS19 mice were treated with Scrambled ASO or TauASO-12 (n=17/
treatment) for 1 month at 30μg/day (grey bar) and survival was monitored. TauASO-12 
treatment prolonged survival (median survival 348 days) compared to Scrambled ASO 
control treatment (median survival 312 days). Log-rank (Mantel Cox) test. (B) PS19 mice at 
8–9 months of age were treated with saline (n=11), Scrambled ASO (n=11) or TauASO-12 
(n=25) for 1 month at 30μg/day. Treatment of non-transgenic (NT) mice with 30μg/day 
Scrambled ASO served as the control (n=30). Alzet osmotic pumps were removed after 1 
month and nestlets were provided to the mice 6 weeks later. PS19 mice treated with saline or 
Scrambled ASO showed no significant difference in untorn nestlet weight or nestlet score, 
and thus these data were combined (control). A perfect nest will have no untorn nestlet left 
and will weigh less, whereas a poor nest will have more untorn nestlets that will weigh 
more. PS19 mice treated with TauASO-12 had significantly less untorn nestlet material than 
control treated PS19 mice. One-way ANOVA, Sidak post hoc analysis. (C) Nestlet score was 
blindly measured on a scale from 0 (untouched nestlet) to 7 (perfect nest). PS19 mice treated 
with TauASO-12 constructed better nests than did control PS19 mice. Kruskal-Wallis test, 
Dunn’s post hoc analysis. *p<0.05. Graphical data are represented as box and whisker plots 
with individual points overlaid, where error bars represent maximum and minimum values 
and the boxed line represents the median.

 Fig. 6. Tau ASOs Reduce Tau Protein in the Non-Human Primate Brain and CSF
(A) Experimental design for 2 week dosing study. SAC: Sacrifice. (B) Quantification of total 
endogenous tau mRNA in the spinal cord and brain of Cynomologus monkeys after ASO 
treatment. Data expressed as percent vehicle (artificial CSF). Nonhuman primates received a 
single dose via lumbar puncture of either vehicle (n=4), 30mg (n=3) or 50mg (n=3) ASO 
against monkey Tau. Tissue was collected 2 weeks after the single dose treatment. One-way 
ANOVA, Sidak post-hoc analysis. (C) Experimental design for 6 week Duration of Action 
study. Nonhuman primates were dosed with 10mg Tau ASO followed 1 week later by a 
repeat dose of 30mg Tau ASO. Control monkeys were treated with Vehicle for both 
injections. Tissue from half of the monkeys was collected at 2 weeks post-treatment (Control 
n=4; Tau ASO n=4) and tissue from the remaining monkeys was collected at 6 weeks after 
the initial dose (Control n=4; Tau ASO n=4). (D, E) Total tau mRNA (D) and protein (E) 
was measured in spinal cord and brain regions at 2 and 6 weeks post initial dose. (F) 
Experimental design for 5 week brain and CSF tau protein analysis. (G) Quantification of 
total endogenous tau protein in the spinal cord and brain of nonhuman primates 5 weeks

Sidak post-hoc analysis. (H) CSF was drawn just prior to the initial dose and again just prior 
to necropsy. The percent change in total tau in the CSF between the two time points for each 
treatment group was calculated. Two-way Repeated Measures ANOVA, Sidak post-hoc 
analysis. (I) CSF tau protein directly correlated with the total tau protein in the 
hippocampus. Linear Regression. #p<0.01, *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001. 
Graphical data are represented as box and whisker plots with individual points overlaid, 
where error bars represent maximum and minimum values and the boxed line represents the 
median.
