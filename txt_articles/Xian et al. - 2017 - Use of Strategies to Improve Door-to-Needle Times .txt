ntravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (IV tPA) 
remains the only medical therapy to improve outcomes for 
acute ischemic stroke.1–3 Results from major clinical trials 
and observational studies confirm a strong influence of time 
to treatment on outcomes, such that the therapeutic benefit is 
maximal when given early, and there is no significant benefit 
beyond 4.5 hours.4–8 Therefore, hospitals are seeking ways to 
reduce in-hospital treatment delays, which is defined as the 
time between patient arrival at the hospital and IV tPA ini-
tiation, or door-to-needle (DTN) times. The American Heart 
Association/American 
Stroke Association 
(AHA/ASA) 
Target: Stroke initiative was launched in January 2010 to 
assist hospitals in improving stroke care and providing IV tPA 
to eligible patients in a timely fashion.9 The Target: Stroke dis-
seminated 10 care strategies to reduce treatment delays in tPA 
administration. Our previous studies demonstrated substantial 
hospital variations in use of these strategies before Target: 
Stroke and significant improvement in terms of timeliness of 
Background—The implementation of Target: Stroke Phase I, the first stage of the American Heart Association’s national 
quality improvement initiative to accelerate door-to-needle (DTN) times, was associated with an average 15-minute 
reduction in DTN times. Target: Stroke phase II was launched in April 2014 with a goal of promoting further reduction 
in treatment times for tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) administration.
Methods and Results—We conducted a second survey of Get With The Guidelines-Stroke hospitals regarding strategies 
used to reduce delays after Target: Stroke and quantify their association with DTN times. A total of 16 901 ischemic stroke 
patients were treated with intravenous tPA within 4.5 hours of symptom onset from 888 surveyed hospitals between June 
2014 and April 2015. The patient-level median DTN time was 56 minutes (interquartile range, 42–75), with 59.3% of 
patients receiving intravenous tPA within 60 minutes and 30.4% within 45 minutes after hospital arrival. Most hospitals 
reported routinely using a majority of Target: Stroke key practice strategies, although direct transport of patients to 
computed tomographic/magenetic resonance imaging scanner, premix of tPA ahead of time, initiation of tPA in brain 
imaging suite, and prompt data feedback to emergency medical services providers were used less frequently. Overall, 
we identified 16 strategies associated with significant reductions in DTN times. Combined, a total of 20 minutes (95% 
confidence intervals 15–25 minutes) could be saved if all strategies were implemented.
Conclusions—Get With The Guidelines-Stroke hospitals have initiated a majority of Target: Stroke–recommended 
strategies to reduce DTN times in acute ischemic stroke. Nevertheless, certain strategies were infrequently practiced and 
represent a potential immediate target for further improvements.  (Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes. 2017;10:e003227.

tPA administration and clinical outcomes after the implemen-
tation of Target: Stroke quality initiative.10,11
With the success of the first stage of Target: Stroke, the 
AHA/ASA launched Target: Stroke phase II in April 2014 to 
continue improving DTN times by challenging hospitals to 
provide IV tPA in patients with acute ischemic stroke in an 
even more timely fashion. The Target: Stroke phase II identi-
fied new strategies for more rapid in-hospital management of 
patients receiving tPA. However, the extent to which hospi-
tals are using these strategies after the Target: Stroke inter-
vention has not been well studied. Although we demonstrated 
in our previous study that some strategies are more strongly 
associated with shorter DTN times than others, reductions 
in treatment delays can rarely be achieved by a single strat-
egy but rather result from multiple concurrent interventions. 
Therefore, we conducted a second national survey of hospitals 
participating in the Target: Stroke program.
The goals were to assess use of hospital strategies to reduce 
DTN times after Target: Stroke and quantify the association 
of these hospital strategies with DTN times. Importantly, we 
sought to determine the incremental effect size of implement-
ing multiple interventions, which represents opportunities to 
reduce all possible delays in treatment.
Methods
Target: Stroke Phase II
Target: Stroke is a national quality improvement initiative devel-
oped by the AHA/ASA in January 2010 (Figure 1).9 The initial goal 
of Target: Stroke for participating hospitals was to achieve DTN 
times within 60 minutes in at least 50% of ischemic stroke patients 
treated with IV tPA. To achieve these goals, Target: Stroke provided 
participating hospitals with best practice strategies, supporting tools, 
and educational resources necessary to improve the timeliness of 
administration of IV tPA to eligible patients with acute ischemic 
stroke. An expert working group performed a systematic review of 
the published data on improving DTN times and identified 10 best 
practice strategies that could be rapidly, feasibly, and cost effectively 
adopted by participating hospitals. These initial strategies included 
advance hospital notification by emergency medical services (EMS), 
rapid triage protocol and stroke team notification, single-call activa-
tion system, specific stroke protocols and tools, rapid acquisition and 
interpretation of brain imaging, rapid laboratory testing, rapid access 
to tPA, premixing tPA ahead of time, a team-based approach, and 
providing prompt feedback to the stroke team on performance. Three 
years after the implementation of Target: Stroke, the median DTN 
times decreased from 74 minutes during the fourth quarter of 2009 to 
59 minutes by the third quarter of 2013, and the percentage of patients 
with DTN times within 60 minutes increased from 30% to 53%.11
To further improve care and reduce treatment delays, the AHA/
ASA launched the Target: Stroke phase II in April 2014 and invited 
all Get With The Guidelines-Stroke (GWTG-Stroke) hospitals to par-
ticipate (Figure 1). The primary goal of Target: Stroke phase II is for 
hospitals to achieve DTN times within 60 minutes in at least 75% of 
patients treated with IV tPA and DTN times within 45 minutes in at 
least 50% of patients. Target: Stroke phase II identified and dissemi-
nated additional best practice strategy of direct EMS transfer of pa-
tients to computed tomographic/magenetic resonance imaging (CT/
MRI) scanner for initial neurological examination and brain imaging 
to determine tPA eligibility, along with an updated comprehensive 
implementation manual; clinical decision support tools; and bench-
marked performance feedback.
As part of the Target: Stroke phase II enrollment process, repre-
sentatives from GWTG-Stroke hospitals were invited to complete an 
online survey regarding their practice for tPA administration in the 6 
months preceding the survey (Figure 1). The survey questions were 
developed based on literature review and expert consensus to query 
hospitals on DTN time practices and further refined after pilot testing. 
These included 11 key best practice strategies and additional hospital 
practices that are potentially related to the timeliness of tPA adminis-
tration. The survey was structured regarding use of specific strategies 
as a continuous 0 to 100% of the time scale or a binary yes/no. The 
online survey was open to all GWTG-Stroke hospitals in December 
2014 and was complete in April 2015.
Statistical Analysis
Using the survey data, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 
GWTG-Stroke hospitals and assessed their use of specific strategies 
for reducing DTN time within 6 months preceding the completion 
of the survey. For descriptive purposes, we reported a hospital’s re-
sponses for each strategy and DTN times among patients treated with 
IV tPA within 4.5 hours in that hospital between June 2014 and April 
2015 (Figure 1). Individual patient-level data were obtained from the 
AHA/ASA GWTG-Stroke Registry. The design and conduct of the 
GWTG-Stroke Registry and the validity and reliability of data collec-
tion have been previously reported.12,13
Multivariable linear regression models were performed to inves-
tigate the relationships between each strategy and DTN times at the 
patient level, adjusting for baseline demographic and clinical char-
acteristics. These variables included age, sex, race/ethnicity, medical 
history (atrial fibrillation, prosthetic heart valve, stroke or transient 
ischemic attack, coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction, 
carotid stenosis, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, hy-
pertension, smoking status, dyslipidemia, and heart failure), arrival 
mode, on-hour presentation (presenting to the emergency department 
[ED] between 7.00 AM and 6.00 PM on any weekday), onset-to-door 
times, and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score. Because 
higher tPA volume has been shown to be associated with shorter DTN 
times,14 a sensitivity analysis was performed by adding annual tPA 
volume in the model.
The effect of each individual strategy on DTN times was cal-
culated as the adjusted mean difference between the DTN times of 
WHAT IS KNOWN
• The benefits of intravenous tissue-type plasminogen 
activator (tPA) in acute ischemic stroke are highly 
time dependent.
• The American Heart Association launched the Tar-
get: Stroke phase II in April 2014 to further promote 
reduction in treatment times for tPA administration.
WHAT THE STUDY ADDS
• Overall, this study identified 16 strategies associated 
with significant reductions in door-to-needle times. 
Combined, a total of 20 minutes could be saved if all 
strategies were implemented.
• Although the majority of key Target: Stroke strate-
gies have been implemented by Get With The Guide-
lines-Stroke–participating hospitals to improve the 
timeliness of tPA administration, certain strategies 
such as direct transport to computed tomographic/
magenetic resonance imaging scanner by emergency 
medical services, premix of tPA ahead of time, pro-
tocol for routine premixing of tPA, and initiation of 
tPA in the brain imaging suite were applied relatively 
infrequently and represent a potential immediate tar-
get for further improvements.

patients treated at hospitals implementing the selected strategy and 
hospitals not implementing the strategy (yes versus no for binary 
response or per 20% increase of the time for continuous response). 
The significant strategies were then analyzed together to evaluate the 
incremental effect of implementing additional strategies and identify 
potential opportunities to reduce possible delays by adopting all best 
practices. All these analyses accounted for within-hospital clustering 
effect using generalized estimating equations with exchangeable cor-
relation structure.
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 
(SAS Institute, Inc). Outcome, a Quintiles Company, is the data 
collection co-ordination center for the AHA/ASA Get With The 
Guidelines program. The Duke Clinical Research Institute served as 
the data analysis center, and institutional review board approval was 
granted to analyze aggregate deidentified data for research purposes.
Results
Of 1701 GWTG-Stroke hospitals, 1034 hospitals (61% 
response rate) completed the survey by April 2015. We 
excluded 127 hospitals that responded to the survey as they 
did not administer tPA during the study period. Because 
DTN times were calculated as the difference between patient 
arrival time and time of tPA initiation, we further excluded 
19 hospitals with missing treatment timelines, treatments 
beyond the 4.5-hour window, tPA given to inpatient with 
stroke, or transferred in patients. After these exclusions, our 
analyses included 888 hospitals treating 16 901 ischemic 
stroke patients with IV tPA within 4.5 hours of symptom 
onset between June 2014 and April 2015. The characteristics 
of hospitals completing the Target: Stroke phase II survey 
versus not are shown in Table 1. Compared with nonpartici-
pating hospitals, hospitals completing the survey were more 
frequently larger, primary stroke centers, with higher isch-
emic stroke volume, shorter DTN times, and more experience 
with tPA administration. The hospital-level median DTN 
time was 59 minutes (interquartile range, [IQR], 51–71), and 
58.7% (521/888) of hospitals achieved DTN times within 60 
minutes for at least 50% patients. In comparison, in a previ-
ous survey between January 2008 and December 2009 before 
Target: Stroke phase I, the median hospital-level DTN time 
was 79 minutes (IQR, 71–89), and only 18.8% hospitals 
met the goal of DTN time of ≤60 minutes in at least 50% of 
treated patients (Figure 1).10
Figure 2 shows the distribution of DTN times of 16 901 
patients treated with IV tPA. Compared with the DTN times 
in the previous survey before Target: Stroke,10 the patient-
level median DTN time decreased from 72 minutes (IQR, 
55–94) to 56 minutes (IQR, 42–75) in Target: Stroke Phase 
II. The percentage of patients with DTN time of ≤60 minutes 
increased from 33.9% (1849/5460) before Target: Stroke to 
59.3% (10 020/16 901) during Target: Stroke phase II. More 
than 30.4% patients (5142/16 901) had DTN time ≤45 minutes.
According to the Target: Stroke phase II survey, most 
hospitals reported routinely using a majority of key strate-
gies (>90%, Figure 3), with the exception of EMS transport 
of patients directly to CT/MRI scanner (median, 40%; IQR, 
0–95), premix of tPA ahead of time (median, 25%, IQR, 
0–90), initiation of tPA in the brain imaging suite (median, 
0%; IQR, 0–5), and prompt data feedback to EMS providers 
(median, 60%; IQR, 15–95). The reported use of other non-
key strategies varied substantially across hospitals. Strategies 
including a timer or clock attached to a chart, clip board, or 
patient’s bed to track time (median, 0%, IQR, 0–5) and plac-
ing a CT/MRI scanner physically in the ED (46.4%) were less 
frequently used.

Multivariable models identified 16 strategies that 
were associated with a significant reduction in DTN times 
(Table 2). These practices included use of EMS prehospital 
stroke screening tool (adjusted mean reduction in DTN time; 
0.9 minute per 20% increase), rapid triage protocol and stroke 
team notification (2.5 minutes per 20% increase), single-call 
activation system (1.1 minutes per 20% increase), a timer 
or clock to track time (0.6 minute per 20% increase), EMS 
direct transport of patient to the CT/MRI scanner (0.7 min-
ute per 20% increase), written informed consent not required 
before tPA administration (0.8 minute per 20% increase), 
international normalized ratio and platelet count not required 
(1.2 minutes per 20% increase), immediate interpretation of 
brain imaging by stroke team members (1.6 minutes per 20% 
increase), treatment decision made by neurologist attend-
ing or trainee after in-person evaluation (1.2 minutes per 
20% increase), trainees (resident, fellows) involved in stroke 
team (1.1 minutes per 20% increase), premix of tPA ahead of 
time (1.1 minutes per 20% increase), initiation of tPA while 
patients are still in the brain imaging suite (3.4 minutes per 
20% increase), prompt data feedback to the ED staff and 
stroke team (1.6 minutes per 20% increase), prompt data feed-
back to EMS providers (1.0 minute per 20% increase), CT/
MRT scanner physically located in the ED (2.1 minutes, yes 
versus no), and protocol for routine premixing tPA (2.6 min-
utes, yes versus no). The sensitivity analyses including annual 
tPA volume found similar results, with few exceptions (Table 
I in the Data Supplement)
When all 16 significant DTN strategies were analyzed 
incrementally, hospitals adopting a greater number of strat-
egies tended to have shorter DTN times. On average, 1.3 
minutes (95% confidence interval, 1.0–1.6) could be saved 
for each strategy implemented or a total of 20 minutes (95% 
confidence interval, 15–25 minutes) if all strategies were used.
Discussion
In this national survey of 888 GWTG-Stroke hospitals par-
ticipating in Target: Stroke phase II, hospitals reported mod-
erate-to-extensive use of most Target: Stroke key strategies to 
evaluate acute stroke cases for tPA eligibility and reduce DTN

within 60 minutes and >30% within 45 minutes after hospi-
tal arrival. However, strategies that most strongly associated 
with shorter DTN times, such as direct transport to CT/MRI 
scanner by EMS, premix of tPA ahead of time, protocol for 
routine premixing of tPA, initiation of tPA in the brain imag-
ing suite, CT/MRI scanner physically located in the ED, and 
a timer or clock attached to track time, were applied relatively 
infrequently (eg, <50%). Assuming all significant strategies 
could be universally adopted, as much as 20 minutes might be 
saved, which could have meaningful clinical implications and 
represents a clear opportunity for further improvement.
The importance of achieving rapid reperfusion for stroke 
cannot be overemphasized. Although the maximum treat-
ment window can be extended up to 4.5 hours after symp-
tom onset, the benefits of tPA are highly time dependent. 
Early treatment is associated with reduced risk of mortal-
ity and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and improved 
functional outcomes.4,6,15 Therefore, rapid reperfusion is a 
critical factor in the outcomes of acute stroke patients who 
are treated with tPA. Effective strategies to minimize DTN 
times in acute ischemic stroke have previously been reported 
in US and European studies.16–22 Consequently, the AHA/
ASA launched the Target: Stroke quality improvement initia-
tive to assist hospitals in their efforts to improve DTN times. 
However, our previous survey of 304 GWTG-Stroke hospi-
tals before Target: Stroke found that many of the best practice 
strategies were not routinely used.10 Although hospitals were 
not entirely the same in both surveys, we observed significant 
uptake of best practice strategies to reduce DTN times when 
assessed 5 years after the launch of Target: Stroke. Advance 
hospital notification by EMS, rapid triage protocol and stroke 
team notification, single-call activation system, stroke tools, 
rapid acquisition and interpretation of braining image, team-
based approach to stroke care, and prompt feedback to the 
ED staff and stroke team were reported >90% of the time 
by the hospitals. This increasing adoption of Target: Stroke 
strategies was accompanied by substantial improvement in 
timeliness of tPA administration, with a median DTN time of 
56 minutes in Target: Stroke phase II and ≈60% of patients 
achieving DTN times within 60 minutes. Although we can-
not prove any causal relationship or generalizability beyond 
GWTG-Stroke–participating hospitals, these findings suggest 
that it is possible to reduce treatment delays by implementing 
evidence-based strategies across US hospitals.
Several strategies that were most strongly associated with 
shorter DTN times were nevertheless infrequently adopted. 
Notably, the DTN times were significantly shorter for hospi-
tals with a protocol for routine premixing tPA (2.6 minutes 
reduction). For each 20% increase in premixing tPA ahead 
of time, 1.6 minutes could be saved. Unlike some strategies 
such as relocation of CT/MRI scanner to the ED (2.1 minutes 
reduction) that might be impractical for some hospitals, pre-
mixing tPA could be easily implemented without additional 
resources. It is the policy of the drug manufacturer to replace 
unused vials free of charge. However, <30% hospitals reported 
having protocol for routine premixing tPA, and premixing is 
seldom practiced among surveyed hospitals (median 25% of 
the time). An appropriate protocol with explicit inclusion/
exclusion criteria could be developed to identify highly prob-
able tPA candidates while avoiding potential tPA wasting. 
Other strategies such as direct transfer of the patient to the 
CT/MRI scanner (0.7 minute reduction per 20% increase) and 
initiation of tPA in the brain imaging suite (3.4 minutes reduc-
tion per 20% increase) only require reorganization of exist-
ing procedures. Similarly, a timer or clock attached to a chart, 
clip board, or patient’s bed to track time (0.6 minute per 20% 
increase) can be achieved with little or no extra investment. 
Another key strategy in the Target: Stroke initiative is prompt 
data feedback. Although most hospitals monitored perfor-
mance and provided data feedback to the ED staff and stroke 
team, there were substantial hospital variations in patient-spe-
cific data feedback to the EMS providers (median, 60%; IQR, 
15%–95% of the time). Because EMS plays a critical role in 
deliver of stroke care, a data feedback system can help EMS 
operators and dispatchers identify specific delays and devise 
strategies to overcome these barriers.
We identified 16 strategies associated with shorter DTN 
times. Although some strategies only improve timeliness of 
tPA administration by a minute or less, previous study has 
suggested that an average patient loses 2 million neurons for 
every minute delay in treatment.5 Each minute saved trans-
lates into an average 1.8 days of extra healthy life for each 
patient receiving tPA.23 Importantly, these approaches are not 
mutually exclusive, and substantial reduction in treatment 
delays can be achieved with multiple concurrent strategies. 
Our survey was completed during the first 12 months after 
the initiation of Target: Stroke Phase II. Although it is too 
early to assess the effectiveness of the program, some indi-
vidual participating hospitals have met the Target: Stroke 
phase II goals. Nevertheless, many hospitals have not met 
the goals for Target: Stroke phase II yet. A more complete 
application of these strategies by participating hospitals is 
recommended.
This study has limitations. First, hospital strategies were 
self-reported and may have some subjectivity that cannot be 
avoided in survey-based research. We extensively pilot tested 
the survey instrument to ensure its clarity and complete-
ness before the launch of the program. An AHA/ASA staff 
member was also available to provide assistance and ensure 
accurate interpretation of questionnaires during the survey. 
Second, the Target: Stroke phase II survey is voluntary, and 
hospitals participate in Target: Stroke based on their level of 
interest in quality improvement in stroke care. Although the 
61% response rate was not as high as desired, it does com-
pare favorably with similar survey research. Nevertheless, 
hospitals completing the survey might not be representative 
of the overall hospital population. Indeed, these hospitals 
were more likely to be primary stroke centers, with higher 
stroke volume, more experience in administering tPA, and 
shorter DTN times. However, the adoption of DTN strate-
gies is likely worse in nonparticipating centers. Therefore, it 
could be argued that greater improvement could be achieved 
in lagging centers by implementing evidence-based strategies. 
Third, this study was a cross-sectional analysis. Although we 
observed significant reductions in DTN times as compared

with those before Target: Stroke,10 any causal relationships 
cannot be established using the current study design. Fourth, 
we did not evaluate the effect of telestroke system for image 
interpretation and clinical evaluation. A follow-up study is 
planned to examine how the implementation of telestroke 
system may facilitate timely evaluation, decision making, and 
treatment in hospitals without stroke expertise on-site. Finally, 
although the focus of the Target: Stroke is to reduce treatment 
delays, the ultimate effect on outcome should be part of the 
assessment of the Target: Stroke strategies. Further studies are 
needed to evaluate the impact of safety and outcomes with 
increased used of these strategies.
Conclusions
Among 888 hospitals participating in the Target: Stroke phase 
II survey, the majority of key Target: Stroke strategies have 
been implemented to improve the timeliness of tPA admin-
istration. Nearly 60% of patients achieved DTN times within 
60 minutes and 30% within 45 minutes. These results sug-
gest that DTN times could be effectively reduced with simple 
policy and organizational changes. Nevertheless, several strat-
egies most strongly associated with shorter DTN times were 
rarely practiced, further supporting the need for a continuous 
national campaign to promote best evidence-based strategies 
and improve the timeliness of tPA treatment in the United 
States.
