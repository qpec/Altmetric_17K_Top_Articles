SUMMARY
Endocannabinoids (eCBs) exert major control over
neuronal activity by activating cannabinoid receptors
(CBRs). The functionality of the eCB system is pri-
marily ascribed to the well-documented retrograde
activation of presynaptic CB1Rs. We find that action
potential-driven eCB release leads to a long-lasting
membrane potential hyperpolarization in hippocam-
pal principal cells that is independent of CB1Rs.
The hyperpolarization, which is specific to CA3 and
CA2 pyramidal cells (PCs), depends on the activation
of neuronal CB2Rs, as shown by a combined phar-
macogenetic and immunohistochemical approach.
Upon activation, they modulate the activity of the so-
dium-bicarbonate co-transporter, leading to a hyper-
polarization of the neuron. CB2R activation occurred
in a purely self-regulatory manner, robustly altered
the input/output function of CA3 PCs, and modulated
gamma oscillations in vivo. To conclude, we describe
a cell type-specific plasticity mechanism in the hip-
pocampus that provides evidence for the neuronal
expression of CB2Rs and emphasizes their impor-
tance in basic neuronal transmission.
INTRODUCTION
The endocannabinoid (eCB) system is one of the main neuromo-
dulatory systems acting in the CNS and is highly conserved
across species (Liu et al., 2009). It predominantly functions by
modulating neural excitability through presynaptic inhibition of
transmitter release and eCB-dependent forms of short- and
long-term plasticity (Brenowitz and Regehr, 2005; Carta et al.,
2014; Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2004; Ha
´ jos and Freund, 2002;
Kim and Alger, 2010; Marsicano et al., 2003; Monory et al.,
2006; Stella et al., 1997). The eCB-mediated plasticity mecha-
nisms are found at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses in
most brain areas (Kano et al., 2009), and they primarily depend
on a Ca2+-dependent postsynaptic release of eCBs and the
retrograde activation of presynaptically located CB1Rs, which
are abundantly expressed in most cell types (Katona and Freund,
2012; Katona et al., 1999). The retrograde mode of action has
first been described for two prominent forms of eCB-mediated
short-term synaptic depression: depolarization-induced sup-
pression of inhibition (DSI) and excitation (DSE, for reviews see
Castillo et al., 2012 and Wilson and Nicoll, 2002). Yet, depending
on the mode of activation, they mediate long-term forms of eCB-
mediated plasticity of transmitter release as well (Chevaleyre and
Castillo, 2003; Gerdeman et al., 2002; Robbe et al., 2002).
In stark contrast to the vast amount of literature on CB1R-
mediated phenomena, very little is known about the relevance
of CB2Rs in neuronal signaling. Indeed, until recently the CB2R
was referred to as the peripheral cannabinoid receptor (CBR), re-
flecting its predominant expression in organs of the immune sys-
tem (Munro et al., 1993) where it participates in the regulation of
immune responses and is responsible for the anti-inflammatory
effects of cannabis (Buckley et al., 2000). A major problem of
studying CB2Rs has been their low expression levels in the
CNS and the lack of reliable antibodies, which has sparked con-
troversy concerning their localization in the brain (Baek et al.,
2013; Marchalant et al., 2014). Yet, the generation of CBR
knockout (KO) mice (Buckley et al., 2000; Zimmer et al., 1999)
and the production of a diverse array of synthetic cannabinoid
agents have advanced and facilitated research on CB2Rs. Espe-
cially behavioral studies have advocated the presence of CB2Rs
in the CNS (Onaivi, 2006; Van Sickle et al., 2005) with properties
that extend their neuro-immunological function. Anatomical and
electrophysiological studies support this notion and suggest a
role of CB2Rs in neural transmission and excitability (den Boon

 et al., 2012; Gong et al., 2006; Morgan et al., 2009). In the hippo-
campus, the presence of CB2Rs has been suggested (Brusco
et al., 2008; Kim and Li, 2015; Li and Kim, 2015), but their phys-
iological role is uncertain. Furthermore, it is not clear whether
they are expressed neuronally or mainly in cells of the immune
system, such as microglia (Schmo
¨ le et al., 2015).
In this paper, we provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that func-
tional CB2Rs are expressed neuronally in the hippocampus and
that they mediate a self-regulatory eCB-mediated plasticity in a
distinct subset of hippocampal principal cells via modulation of
the sodium/bicarbonate co-transporter (NBC).
RESULTS
Backpropagating Action Potentials Induce a
Cell Type-Specific Hyperpolarization in Hippocampal
Principal Cells
In response to trains of action potentials (APs), we observed a
long-lasting membrane potential (Vm) hyperpolarization in CA3
pyramidal cells (PCs), which outlasted the classic after hyperpo-
larization (AHP). The hyperpolarization persisted for the duration
of the recording (up to 20 min after the induction), was as large as
�10 mV (Figure 1A), and was present in all cells tested when re-
corded in perforated-patch (pp) configuration, in which the intra-
cellular milieu of the recorded cell remains undisturbed. When
repeating the above experiment in whole-cell (wc) configuration,
we observed a fraction of unresponsive cells, which might
explain why this form of plasticity has not been observed before,
and thus a cutoff was introduced to classify cells as reactive and
unreactive (Figures S1A and S1B; see Experimental Proce-
dures). We compared different recording parameters and found
a significant correlation between the access resistance (Ra) and
the degree of hyperpolarization (Figures S1C–S1F). We further-
more performed a subset of wc recordings with a potassium glu-
conate-based internal solution (instead of methanesulfonate) or
with 1 mg/ml biocytin, in both of which we observed a complete
abolition of the hyperpolarization (data not shown). Although the
reasons for this are unresolved, many studies previously have re-
ported that internal solutions and anions alter and interfere with
membrane properties (Eckert et al., 2001; Kaczorowski et al.,
2007).
To elucidate whether this hyperpolarization is a mechanism
common to all hippocampal principal cell types or displays
cell type specificity, we examined CA1 PCs and dentate gyrus
granule cells (DG GCs, both recorded in pp configuration), as
well as CA2 PCs. In contrast to CA3 PCs that hyperpolarized
to similar extents independent of their location within CA3,
neither CA1 PCs nor DG GCs hyperpolarized in response to
AP trains (Figures 1B and 1C). This induction failure could be
the result of a different induction threshold. To test for this, we
used a theta-frequency burst protocol, consisting of four times
as many APs as the standard protocol (see Experimental Proce-
dures), that is known to trigger eCB-mediated long-term depres-
sion (LTD) in these cells (Younts et al., 2013). However, this also
failed to induce a long-lasting hyperpolarization in CA1 PCs
(Figures S2A–S2C). Contrary to this, morphologically identified
CA2 PCs did express this form of cellular plasticity (Figures
S2D–S2F).

 The Long-Lasting Hyperpolarization Is Dependent on
the Release of Endogenous 2-AG and Neuronal
Cannabinoid Type 2 Receptors
What could be the underlying mechanism of this self-inhibitory
long-term plasticity? eCBs are known to modulate many forms
of long-term plasticity in the CNS (Chevaleyre et al., 2006), and
high-frequency stimulation (HFS) has been shown to lead to
the release of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) in hippocampal
slices (Stella et al., 1997). To assess whether the activity-
dependent release of 2-AG—the most ubiquitous eCB in the
CNS that is synthesized and released upon a sufficient rise in
intracellular calcium (Sugiura et al., 2002)—mediates the plas-
ticity, we recorded from mice lacking the 2-AG-synthesizing
enzyme DAGLa (Jenniches et al., 2015). To confirm the lack
of 2-AG synthesis in the DAGLa KOs, we recorded DSI in
DAGLa�/� CA3 PCs since 2-AG is the main eCB involved in
both DSI and DSE (Hashimotodani et al., 2008). In contrast
to wild-type (WT) controls, DSI was completely abolished in
DAGLa�/� CA3 PCs, as measured by the change in amplitude
and frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents
(sIPSCs; Figures 2A and 2B). Next we tested whether lack of
2-AG would have an effect on the AP-mediated hyperpolar-
ization and found that it also was absent in these animals (Fig-
ures 2C and 2D), thereby establishing that this effect is depen-
dent on AP-driven 2-AG release.
The main CBRs that eCBs act on are CB1 and CB2. Previously,
it has been reported that CB1Rs activate G protein-coupled
inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels on subsets of
cortical neurons in response to AP trains (Bacci et al., 2004;
Marinelli et al., 2009). This phenomenon, termed slow self-inhib-
tion (SSI), also leads to a long-lasting Vm hyperpolarization.
To test whether the same mechanism may underlie the hyperpo-
larization, we recorded CA3 PCs from CB1R�/� mice, but we
found that the effect was fully intact in these animals (Figure 3A).
We then recorded CA3 PCs from CB2R�/� mice (the other main
CBR); surprisingly, the effect was absent in these animals, sug-
gesting that CB2Rs mediate the long-lasting hyperpolarization
(Figure 3B).
Assuming that CB2Rs mediate the AP-induced hyperpolar-
ization, preincubation of slices with CBR antagonists should
abolish the effect in WT and CB1R KO animals. First, we
confirmed that the percentage of reactive cells recorded in wc
configuration was comparable between CB1R�/� and WT CA3
PCs and that the hyperpolarization was absent in CB2R KOs (Fig-
ures S3A and S3B). We then preincubated slices with the mixed
cannabinoid inverse agonist AM-251 that, as predicted, blocked
the AP-induced hyperpolarization in both WT and CB1R mutant
CA3 PCs (Figures S3C and S3D). It is of note that this result indi-
cates that AM-251 efficiently targets CB2Rs at concentrations
that are commonly considered to be CB1R specific (2–5 mM).
In addition, we preincubated slices from CB1R�/� mice with
the CB2R-specific inverse agonist SR144528 (SR), which suc-
cessfully blocked the hyperpolarization in all cells tested (Figures
S3C and S3D). These results support the presence of functional
CB2Rs that can be blocked pharmacologically.
It is known that CB2Rs are expressed in macrophage lineage
cells including microglia that have been shown to modulate
neuronal transmission (Salter and Beggs, 2014). Furthermore,
as of yet, direct evidence for the neuronal expression of CB2Rs
is still negligible, due to the lack of specific antibodies and
neuron-specific genetic manipulations. Thus, to verify this unex-
pected finding and to test for the neuronal expression of CB2Rs,
we generated a neuron-specific CB2R KO mouse in which the
CB2R-encoding gene Cnr2 is deleted under a synapsin promoter
via the Cre/loxP system (Syn-CB2R KO; see Experimental Proce-
dures; Figure S4). We found that in these mice the hyperpolar-
ization was equally absent as in the constitutive KO (Figure 3C).
Importantly, the hyperpolarization in the CB2R+/+ littermate con-
trols was not different from C57BL/6 WT mice (Mann-Whitney
test, p = 0.67; Figure 3D). As a general control for the properties

and DAGLa�/� CA3 PCs to test for the presence of
DSI. In contrast to a DSI+ WT CA3 PC (upper

(0 mV for 3 3 1 s) failed to induce DSI (lower trace).

significantly from WT controls (n(N) = 5(1)), 0.55 ±

The absolute sIPSC amplitude and frequency after

 of CA3 PCs recorded from the mutant mice used, we compared
their basic intrinsic physiological properties, which were not
different from C57BL/6 or littermate WT mice (Figure S3E).
Thus, any changes observed were unlikely to stem from differ-
ences in their basal properties. In summary, these results
strongly suggest that the hyperpolarization depends on the acti-
vation of neuronal CB2Rs and is independent of CB1R activation
(Figures 3E and 3F).
To support this finding, we performed in situ hybridization
(ISH) assays for CB2R mRNA in hippocampi of Syn-CB2R KO
(Figures 4A–4C and S4) and CB2R KO (Figure S6) mice. Figure 4
shows the RNAscope ISH results, illustrating co-localization of
Cnr2 (green) and Rbfox3 (a neuronal marker gene that encodes
NeuN, red) in the majority of hippocampal neurons in the CA3 re-
gion in WT mice, but not in Syn-CB2R KO mice (Figures 4A–4C).
We detected similar amounts of CB2R mRNA in area CA2, but
much lower levels in areas CA1 and DG (Figure S5).
We noted that Cnr2 was still detectable in hippocampal tissue
of Syn-CB2R KO mice (Figure 4C, lower panels), which may

reflect Cnr2 expression in glial cells. To
test this hypothesis, we used fluores-
cence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to
separate
hippocampal
neuronal
cells
and glial cells (Figure 4D), and then we
used qPCR to measure Cnr2 expression
levels in each cell population. We found

(�70%
reduction) in Syn-CB2R KO mice and
completely abolished in CB2R KO mice
(Figure 4E). As expected, we detected
CB2R mRNA also in non-neuronal cells in WT and Syn-CB2R
KO mice, but not in CB2R KO mice (Figure 4E). Unexpectedly,
low levels of Cnr2 gene were still detectable in NeuN+ cells in
Syn-CB2R KO mice (Figure 4E), which may be related to the im-
purity of the sorted neurons (e.g., a small fraction of glial cells
may contaminate the NeuN+ population). To test this hypothesis,
we examined Rbfox3 and the glial marker genes Itgam, Cspg4,
and Aldh1L1, which encode CD11b (a microglial marker), NG-2
(an oligodendrocyte marker), and ALDH1L1 (an astrocyte
marker), respectively, in each cell population. We detected a
small percentage (�25%) of glial markers in the NeuN+ popula-
tion (Figure 4G, a). Since glial cells also express Cnr2 (Figure 4E),
this may well explain why low levels of Cnr2 expression (�30%)
are detectable in NeuN+ cells of Syn-CB2R KO mice. As a con-
trol, we analyzed the same samples for CB1R mRNA expression,
which was not different between NeuN+ (and NeuN�) cells of
WT, Syn-CB2R KO, and CB2R KO mice (Figure 4F). To further
confirm this finding, we compared Cnr2 expression among
WT, CB1R, and CB2R KO mice with classical ISH in combination
798

 with immunostainings. We found a similar degree of co-localiza-
tion of Cnr2 with NeuN and vGluT2 (a marker for glutamatergic
neurons) in WT and CB1R KO mice, while Cnr2 was undetectable
in the CB2R KO mice (Figure S5).
The Activity-Induced Hyperpolarization Can Be
Mimicked and Occluded by CBR Agonists
As a further line of evidence supporting the presence of func-
tional CB2Rs, we tested whether we can mimic the AP-driven hy-
perpolarization by directly activating CB2Rs pharmacologically.
The mixed CBR agonists 2-AG and WIN,55212-2 (WIN) as well
as the CB2R-specific agonist HU-308 (HU) all strongly hyperpo-
larized CA3 PCs in WT mice (Figures 5A–5C, 5E, and 5F). To
confirm that the drug-induced hyperpolarization was indeed
due to CB2R activation and as a control for the specificity of
HU for CB2Rs at the concentration used, we tested 2-AG and
HU in slices of (Syn-)CB2R�/� mice. Neither of the drugs led to
a hyperpolarization in these animals, strongly arguing for a purely
CB2R-dependent mechanism (Figures 5D–5F). Additionally, late
application of AM-251 could reverse the hyperpolarization
induced by 2-AG, arguing for the same target receptor (Fig-
ure 5G). To substantiate the assumption of a shared CB2R-
dependent mechanism between AP-dependent release of
endogenous 2-AG and exogenously applied CBR agonists, we
performed occlusion experiments. When the agonist HU was
applied before AP trains, and also when these stimuli were
applied in the reverse sequence, the maximal CB2R activation
via one process occluded the other, as the respective second
stimulus failed to elicit an additional hyperpolarization (Figures
5H and 5I).
The Hyperpolarization Is Mediated by a G Protein- and
Sodium-Dependent Modulation of the NBC
AsCBRsareG protein-coupledreceptors(GPCRs),weconfirmed
that the hyperpolarization is mediated by a G protein-dependent
cascade by performing experiments with 0.5 mM GDPßS, a
non-hydrolyzable GDP analog that blocks G protein-coupled ac-
tivity. The inclusion of GDPßS into the pipette abolished the phar-
macologically induced hyperpolarization within the manipulated
neuron (Figures 6A and 6B), supporting the idea of a cell-intrinsic,
G protein-dependent mechanism.
CBRs, like many other neuronal GPCRs, couple to GIRK chan-
nels (Ho et al., 1999; Mackie et al., 1995), which at first glance
appear as a likely downstream target of CB2R activation to
mediate the hyperpolarization via an extrusion of potassium
from the cell. However, when analyzing the pharmacologically
induced hyperpolarization, we observed no change in input resis-
tance concurrent with the hyperpolarization (Figures 6C–6E). As a
control for a GPCR-dependent activation of GIRK, we recorded
from CA3 PCs and applied 1 mM adenosine that is known to act
on adenosine receptors that in turn activate GIRK. As expected
for a conductance-based mechanism, we found a significant
reduction of the Rin that was furthermore reversed by the GIRK
antagonist SCH-23390 (Figure S7A). In contrast to this, the acute
application of SCH-23390 failed to repolarize the Vm of CA3 PCs
after the successful induction of the hyperpolarization by both
AP-dependent release of 2-AG and pharmacological CB2R acti-
vation (Figure S7B). We also analyzed the current-voltage rela-
tionship with step protocols before and after CB2R activation
(Figure 6E). To conclude, in contrast to cortical SSI, which is
mediated by GIRK channels, this set of experiments strongly ar-
gues against a conductance-based process and the involvement
of GIRK channels in the hyperpolarization.
Next we investigated the involvement of ionic gradients
and electrogenic pumps. In a first set of experiments, we
blocked the sodium/chloride co-transporter KCC2 (with 10 mM
VU0240551),
the
sodium/potassium/chloride
co-transporter
NKCC (with 10 mM bumetanide), and the sodium/hydrogen
exchanger (with 10 mM cariporide), but we could not antagonize
the long-lasting hyperpolarization. Further, we removed either
chloride or potassium from the media; however, the effect was
still fully intact (data not shown). Finally, replacing sodium with
N-Methyl-D-glucamin (NMDG) resulted in a complete abolish-
ment of the agonist-induced hyperpolarization (Figure 6F).
Furthermore, preincubation with a specific blocker of the NBC
prevented the long-lasting hyperpolarization, both for agonist-
as well as AP-driven induction (Figures 6F–6J), arguing for the
specific involvement of the NBC. To rule out that mere interfer-
ence with the Vm, via the change of intra- and extracellular so-
dium concentrations, occludes the hyperpolarization, we prein-
cubated slices with a blocker for the sodium/potassium pump
that is expressed in CA3 PCs and has been shown to hyperpo-
larize neurons in an activity-dependent manner as well (Gustafs-
son and Wigstro
¨ m, 1983). Yet, in the presence of 10 mM ouabain,
the hyperpolarization was fully intact (in contrast to NBC block
and NMDG replacement, summary graphs in Figures 6I and
6J). To conclude, we found that the hyperpolarization is depen-
dent on (1) extracellular sodium and its gradient across the mem-
brane and (2) the activity of the NBC.
Acute Reversal of the Hyperpolarization by CB2R Inverse
Agonists
What is the underlying cause of the long-lasting nature of the
hyperpolarization? HFS can increase 2-AG levels for several
minutes (Stella et al., 1997), and it has been shown that eCB-
mediated LTD of inhibitory inputs can be reversed by applying
AM-251 5 min, but not 10 min, after the induction (Chevaleyre
and Castillo, 2003). Additionally, it has been suggested previ-
ously that antagonists can acutely reverse other forms of long-
term plasticity such as mGluR-dependent LTD (Palmer et al.,
1997), which is likely to be due to a persistent receptor activation
even in an agonist-unbound state (Lodge et al., 2013). To test for
these possibilities, we first performed control recordings in WT
CA3 PCs for >25 min to confirm the feasibility of pharmacological
manipulation during longer recordings (Figures S8A and S8B).
In a separate set of experiments, we then acutely applied the
CB2R-specific inverse agonist SR after eliciting the hyperpolar-
ization in CA3 PCs with the AP protocol. We found that late appli-
cation of SR repolarized the Vm back to its baseline levels in all
cells tested (Figures S8C–S8E). Because we applied the drug
at different time points (�5–15 min after the induction; Fig-
ure S8C) and could reverse the hyperpolarization even 15 min af-
ter induction, it is unlikely to still depend on elevated 2-AG levels.
Thus, this dataset suggests that constitutive receptor activa-
tion may be the mechanism underlying the persistency of this
particular form of plasticity. We performed these experiments

pharmacological agent.
Comparison of CB2R- versus Presynaptic eCB-Mediated
Effects
Do CB2Rs also modulate classic eCB-mediated alterations of
presynaptic function and does the hyperpolarization have similar
characteristics? First, we tested whether the hyperpolarization
depends on synaptic transmission and found that it was intact
in block of both excitatory and inhibitory transmissions (Fig-
ure 7A). Second, DSI has been shown to be a mechanism that
acts in an autocrine and a paracrine manner (Kreitzer et al.,
2002; Wilson and Nicoll, 2001 but see Younts et al., 2013). To
test if the AP-driven release of 2-AG by one neuron is sufficient
to elicit a hyperpolarization in neighboring neurons, we per-
formed dual pp recordings of adjacent CA3 PCs (distance be-
tween pipette tips: 11 ± 1.2 mm), and we found no evidence for
a detectable spread of the effect between PCs (Figures 7C and
7D). Third, to test whether CB2R activation could mimic DSI,
we recorded evoked IPSCs (eIPSCs) in CA3 PCs and induced
DSI by depolarization of the recorded neuron. Conversely, sub-
sequent application of 1 mM HU did not alter the eIPSC amplitude
of DSI+ neurons (Figure 7E). Additionally, the reduction of field
excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs, recorded in CA3)
observed upon application of the mixed CBR agonist WIN, which
is also ascribed a presynaptic mode of action (Takahashi
and Castillo, 2006), could not be mimicked by HU (Figure 7F).
To conclude, the hyperpolarization appears to be a solely self-
regulatory cell-intrinsic mechanism that acts complementary to
presynaptic CBRs.
Physiological Stimulation and Functional Significance of
CB2Rs
We assessed the functional significance of CB2R activation both
on a single cell and on a network level. In stark contrast to the so
far employed artificial fixed-frequency induction protocol, both
the frequency and amount of neuronal spiking in vivo were irreg-
ular, highly variable, and temporally complex. CA3 PCs in partic-
ular are known to spike frequently when recorded in vivo, both as
single spikes and in bursts (Tropp Sneider et al., 2006). We thus
considered whether physiologically relevant activity patterns are
able to induce the hyperpolarization, and we constructed a spike
train based on in vivo place field firing patterns of CA3 PCs (see
Experimental Procedures). Indeed, we found that this physiolog-
ical spike train (PST) elicited a hyperpolarization with an average
DVm that did not differ from the standard protocol (unpaired
t test, p = 0.42; Figures 8A–8C).
Next we investigated whether the long-lasting hyperpolar-
ization affects the output of CA3 PCs. We therefore compared
the spike probability of synaptically evoked AP firing in CA3
PCs before and after the application of HU. In those cells that hy-
perpolarized (wc: 5/8 reactive cells), we found a simultaneous,
robust reduction in spike probability by >80% (Figures 8D–8F).
To test whether this was causally linked to the hyperpolarization
induced by the CB2R agonist, we clamped the cells to their initial
baseline Vm with constant current injection at the end of each
experiment. As expected, this was sufficient to restore the initial
spike probability in all neurons (0.93 ± 0.04, normalized to 1).
Conversely, when we manually hyperpolarized the unreactive
cells with current injections (baseline Vm: �64.7 ± 0.8 mV, hyper-
polarized Vm: �72.5 ± 0.5 mV), we were able to mimic the reduc-
tion in spike probability induced by the CB2R agonist-mediated
hyperpolarization (0.1 ± 0.036, normalized to 1). In summary,
these experiments indicate that the Vm hyperpolarization
following activation of CB2Rs significantly shifts the rheobase
of CA3 PCs and profoundly reduces their input/output function.
Finally, to study the role of CB2R signaling in network dy-
namics, we recorded local field potentials (LFPs) in area CA3
of freely behaving mice that were systemically treated with the
CB2R agonist HU or vehicle. LFP oscillations in the slow gamma
band (30–85 Hz), generated locally in area CA3 (Csicsvari et al.,
2003), and theta (5–10 Hz) oscillations determine hippocampal
network synchronization and information processing during
exploratory behavior. During baseline recordings and after
vehicle administration, the amplitude of gamma oscillations
changed as a function of the theta phase; more pronounced var-
iations of gamma amplitude were found during theta cycles of
higher amplitude (Figure 8G, upper panel), in agreement with
earlier reports (Schomburg et al., 2014; Wulff et al., 2009).
In contrast, following the agonist administration, slow gamma
modulation was significantly less strongly determined by
changes of theta oscillation amplitude in WT mice (Figure 8G,
lower panel), but not in Syn-CB2R�/� mice (F1,10 = 0.3,
p = 0.59). The power of theta and gamma oscillations as well
as the theta modulation of intermediate (65–120 Hz) gamma
oscillations were not affected by the agonist treatment (power:
F1,13 = 1.0, p = 0.33 and F1,13 = 1.5, p = 0.24; modulation:
Figure 8H). Additional LFP recordings in area CA3 of behaving
Syn-CB2R�/� mice and their WT littermates revealed a reduced
power of gamma oscillations in the mutant (Figure S9). Alto-
gether, these results suggest that neuronal CB2Rs regulate
gamma oscillations in area CA3 in vivo.
DISCUSSION
CB2Rs have been reported to be modulated during a variety
of complex neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression,
schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorders, and, due to their

Syn-CB2R�/� mice was substantially reduced (�70% reduction), and abolished in the CB2R�/� mice.

neuronal cells (b), but not in NeuN+ hippocampal neurons (a). Data shown in (a) were normalized to Rbfox3 expression in the NeuN+ population, which was
defined as 1. Data shown in (b) were normalized to each respective marker gene level in NeuN+ (Rbfox3) and NeuN� cells (all three glial markers).

 non-psychotropic mode of action, they are considered prom-
ising therapeutic targets (Onaivi, 2011). Yet, in contrast to the
well-established function and localization of CB1Rs, little is
known about their role in basic neurotransmission. By providing
a first description of functional, neuronally expressed CB2Rs in
area CA3 of the hippocampus, our findings now reveal, to our
knowledge, a novel role for CB2Rs in the CNS, and they chal-
lenge the classic, CB1R-focused view on eCB function.
In summary, we find that neuronal CB2Rs mediate a long-
lasting, cell-intrinsic hyperpolarization in hippocampal principal
neurons of areas CA3 and CA2. The CB2R-dependent hyperpo-
larization can be triggered via the release of endogenous 2-AG

 or by direct pharmacological receptor activation. Because it is
long-lasting in its nature and is additionally independent of excit-
atory and inhibitory synaptic transmission, the hyperpolarization
appears to be an intrinsic plasticity process that negatively mod-
ulates the excitability of CA3 PCs.
Cell Type-Specific Expression of the CB2R-Mediated
Plasticity
The AP-dependent hyperpolarization can only be induced in CA3
and CA2 PCs, which resemble each other in their electrophysio-
logical properties (Wittner and Miles, 2007), but not in the other
two main principal cell populations of the hippocampus, namely
CA1 PCs and DG GCs. This may be either due to a lack of CB2R
protein or due to an induction failure. The former is unlikely since
we detected low levels of CB2R mRNA in these cell populations
as well. We thus tested the latter hypothesis and found that we
can readily induce a hyperpolarization of CA1 PCs by pharmaco-
logical activation of CB2Rs with both HU and WIN (data not
shown). In combination with the finding that even strong stimuli
that are known to trigger eCB-mediated LTD at this synapse
(Younts et al., 2013) failed to elicit a hyperpolarization, these re-
sults support the notion that functional CB2Rs are present in CA1
(and DG) but are not activated by physiological activity. Possible
explanations for this induction failure are manifold, including dif-
ferences in the expression levels and distribution of the CB2R or
other components of the ECS, and highlight the fact that the
development of specific CB2R antibodies (Baek et al., 2013;
Marchalant et al., 2014) is crucially important to determining their
expression on a (sub-)cellular level.
Neuronal Expression of Functional CB2Rs in Area CA3
The expression of CB2Rs in the CNS has been subject to
much debate (Onaivi, 2006), with many published studies being
unable to detect any CB2R mRNA or ligand binding in brain
preparations or only in microglia (Buckley et al., 2000; Galie
` gue
et al., 1995; Schmo
¨ le et al., 2015). However, behavioral and
electrophysiological studies have suggested the functional pres-
ence of CB2Rs (Onaivi, 2006; Van Sickle et al., 2005; Xi et al.,
2011; Zhang et al., 2014). Therefore, the following question

and are significantly different from control WT cells (DVm: p < 0.0001, compare
to Figure 5E). Note that the remaining reactive cells (indicted by filled circles)

 remains: are CB2Rs expressed in neurons? To address this
question, we generated a novel, neuron-specific CB2R KO to
use in combination with electrophysiological and molecular
biology techniques. First, the finding that the CB2R-mediated hy-
perpolarization is absent in the neuron-specific CB2R KO argues
for the presence of functional neuronal CB2Rs at a protein level.
Second, by means of ISH (with a fluorescence double-labeling
strategy) and FACS/qPCR assays, we are able to demonstrate
the expression of CB2R mRNA in hippocampal glutamatergic
neurons and, more specifically, CA3 PCs. Taken together, these
data provide strong and direct evidence for the neuronal expres-
sion of functional CB2Rs in the CNS.
What Underlies the Long-Lasting Hyperpolarization
Mechanistically?
Surprisingly, the hyperpolarization was not accompanied by a
change in membrane resistance, which rules out the involvement
of a conductance-based mechanism (unlike cortical SSI, Bacci
et al., 2004) and suggests the involvement of an ion pump or
co-transporter. CBRs have been shown before to modulate the
activity of ion co-transporters, such as the sodium/hydrogen
exchanger (Bouaboula et al., 1999). Following this lead, we per-
formed experiments with NMDG-based sodium replacement
that hinted toward a sodium-dependent process. Finally, block
of the NBC by a specific antagonist abolished both the AP-driven
and pharmacologically induced hyperpolarization, suggesting it
to be the downstream target of CB2R activation.
The NBC is a member of the SLC4 solute carrier family and
plays an important role in intracellular pH regulation by accumu-
lating intracellular bicarbonate driven by the inwardly directed
sodium gradient (for a review see Ruffin et al., 2014). Hippocam-
pal PCs express NBCs (Majumdar et al., 2008) and functional
studies indicate a role in pH regulation during neuronal activity
(Chesler and Kaila, 1992). To our knowledge, our study provides
the first evidence for a functional coupling between cannabinoid
signaling and the NBC. Future studies will discover the molecular
mechanisms involved in this interaction.
A possible cause for the long-lasting hyperpolarization upon
CB2R activation could be identified based on the observation
that the acute application of a CB2R inverse agonist reversed
the AP-triggered hyperpolarization. Given that endogenous
2-AG is broken down rapidly (Sugiura et al., 2002) and other
studies estimated the prolonged presence of 2-AG after HFS
to be �5 min (Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2003), it is unlikely that

 2-AG remains available to constitutively activate the receptor up
to 15 min after induction. Thus, our data suggest that the tran-
sient stimulation of CB2Rs by activity-evoked release of 2-AG
may alter their properties, rendering them persistently active in
the absence of agonist, similar to observations on mGluRs
(Lodge et al., 2013; Young et al., 2013).
Complementary Action of CB1 and CB2 Receptors
As mentioned in the Introduction, membrane-derived lipids
including eCBs predominantly function through presynaptic
inhibition of transmitter release. Only few studies have demon-
strated changes in neuronal excitability that depend on cell-
intrinsic eCB modulation (Bacci et al., 2004; den Boon et al.,

oscillations with theta oscillation troughs is altered after the CB2R agonist administration. (H) The theta modulation of slow (30–85 Hz), but not intermediate
(65–120 Hz), gamma oscillations was reduced by the agonist administration (vehicle: n(N) = 15(10), agonist: n(N) = 13(10), F1,13 = 9.1, p = 0.010, slow, F1,13 = 0.0,
p = 0.86, ANOVA).

 2012). Thus, the question arises, how might CB2R activation
contribute to the fine-tuned, highly complex eCB neuromodula-
tory system that controls a single neuron’s physiology and excit-
ability from presynaptic transmitter release to spike output?
Our data suggest that, on a cellular level, CB1Rs and CB2Rs
may provide a non-overlapping functionality with CB1Rs being
expressed mostly presynaptically and CB2Rs on postsynaptic
compartments of hippocampal CA3/2 PCs. A complementary
modulation of the auto-associative CA3 network by (1) CB1Rs
that presynaptically modulate chemical transmission and alter
synaptic weights of incoming inputs and (2) CB2Rs that alter
the cell’s intrinsic properties in response to AP firing provides a
powerful mechanism to fine-tune the network’s excitability.
This seems especially important in areas CA3 and CA2 that are
recurrently connected and, thus, particularly susceptible to
hyperexcitability and imbalanced network states (Le Duigou
et al., 2014; Sloviter, 1991). In line with this, the hypothesis of
CB2Rs providing a functional safety brake is plausible. Further-
more, given the long-lasting nature of the hyperpolarization,
one might speculate that, especially during ongoing activity
in vivo, CB2Rs will provide a rather tonic inhibition.
Physiological Relevance of CB2R Activation in the
Hippocampus
The in vivo and in vitro analyses of CB2R function show that they
impact the output of a single CA3 PC as well as alter locally gener-
ated network oscillations in the behaving animal. We show that
PSTs activate CB2Rs and that their activation reduces the spike
probability of CA3 PCs. Our finding, that a change in the Vm
strongly affects the input/output transformation of CA3 PCs,
supports the idea that intrinsic membrane properties are highly
relevant for single-cell excitability and information processing
(Kowalski et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2012). The hippocampus exhibits
several functionally distinct types of gamma oscillations including
locally generated, slow oscillations and intermediate/fast oscilla-
tions that originate in the entorhinal cortex and entrain the hippo-
campus (Colgin et al., 2009; Csicsvari et al., 2003; Schomburg
et al., 2014). It is thought that the cross-frequency coupling of
hippocampal theta and gamma oscillations, as observed during
exploratory behaviors, may serve as a coding scheme for working
memory and to provide the basis for simultaneously encoding
information at different timescales. In the CA3 area gamma oscil-
lations arise from interactions between PCs and interneurons,
rendering gamma synchronization sensitive to changes of excit-
ability of these cell types (Buzsa
´ ki and Wang, 2012).
We found that acute application of a CB2R agonist selectively
affects the theta-dependent modulation of gamma oscillations
in WT mice, but not Syn-CB2R�/� mice, and that Syn-CB2R�/�
mice exhibit reduced power of gamma oscillations. In contrast,
the effects of eCBs on network oscillations in vivo exerted via
CB1Rs are widespread and affect synchronization across fre-
quency bands (Robbe et al., 2006), suggesting a more specific
involvement of CB2R in spatial coding modes supported by
gamma oscillations (Bieri et al., 2014). To summarize, the reduced
spike probabilityof CA3PCsin vitroandtheselectivedisruptionof
slow gamma oscillations by CB2R activation strongly suggest that
neuronal CB2Rs are important modulators of local network
rhythms. Recent studies have suggested that a lack of CB2Rs
impairs hippocampal memory function (Garcı
´a-Gutie
´ rrez et al.,
2013;LiandKim,2016),similartotheeffectofCB1Rdeficitinadult
mice (Bilkei-Gorzo et al., 2005). Further electrophysiological and
behavioral analyses of the Syn-CB2R KO will hopefully help us
gain a better understanding of their role in hippocampal informa-
tion processing both on a single cell and on a network level.
Conclusions
In comparison to the vast literature on CB1R function in the CNS,
the current state of knowledge concerning CB2Rs is negligible.
It is thus crucial to highlight their importance in basic neuronal
transmission. Our results provide, to our knowledge, a first in-
depth description of neuronal CB2R expression and their func-
tional relevance in the hippocampus.

dance with the guidelines of local authorities (Berlin, Germany), the German
Animal Welfare Act, and the European Council Directive 86/609/EEC. KO
mice were maintained on a C57BL/6 genetic background and generated in
the laboratory of A.Z. (Buckley et al., 2000; Jenniches et al., 2015; Zimmer
et al., 1999). Neuron-specific, conditional CB2R KO mice were generated
by crossing mice expressing Cre recombinase under the Synapsin I promoter
with floxed CB2R animals.
In Vitro Electrophysiology
Electrophysiological recordings from hippocampal slices were made as
described previously (Maier et al., 2011, 2012). The AP trains (inter-stimulus
interval: 10 ms, inter-train interval: 20 s) were induced with 2-ms-long, so-
matic-current injections. Pharmacological agents were bath applied. Sample
sizes are given as the number of experiments (n) and of animals (N). Normally
distributed datasets were compared with a two-tailed Student’s t test and
values are expressed as mean ± SEM. Nonparametric tests were used as indi-
cated and data are presented as median (with 25th and 75th percentiles). Re-
sults were considered significant at p < 0.05. Given Vm values are not cor-
rected for liquid junction potential. In wc recordings, cells were classified as
reactive or nonreactive based on a 2.1-mV cutoff.
In Vivo Electrophysiology
Mice were implanted with arrays of single-tungsten wires in area CA3, and the
LFP was recorded while the animals explored freely in an open arena. After 1 hr
of baseline recordings, animals were injected with either vehicle (10 mg/kg
DMSO) or with HU (10 mg/kg, dissolved in DMSO) and were recorded in the
arena for 1 hr more. Phase-amplitude coupling of theta and gamma oscilla-
tions was computed as described previously (Wulff et al., 2009). The statistical
significance of comparisons was determined by a two-way ANOVA.
Molecular Biology
Standard molecular biology techniques as well as classical ISH, RNAscope
ISH, and FACS assays were performed as described previously (Buckley
et al., 2000; Li et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014). For the RNA-
scope ISH in the Syn-CB2R KO, the probes Mm-Cnr2-O2 and Mm-Rbfox3-
C2 were designed and provided by Advanced Cell Diagnostics. For FACS,
cells were sorted with a PE-labeled (fluorescent) anti-NeuN antibody (1:500;
FCMAB317PE, Millipore) and validated the purity of the detected cell popula-
tions with qRT-PCR analysis of Rbfox3 and Itgam, Cspg4, and Aldh1l1.
