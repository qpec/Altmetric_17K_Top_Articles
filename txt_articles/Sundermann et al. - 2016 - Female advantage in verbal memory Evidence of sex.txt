Female advantage in verbal memory
Evidence of sex-specific cognitive reserve
ABSTRACT
Objective: We investigated sex differences in verbal memory across different levels of neural dys-
function, measured by temporal lobe glucose metabolic rates (TLGluMR).
Methods: Three hundred ninety controls and 672 participants with amnestic mild cognitive
impairment (aMCI) and 254 with Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia from the Alzheimer’s Dis-
ease Neuroimaging Initiative completed the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) and
[18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose–PET. Cross-sectional analyses were conducted using linear regres-
sion to examine the sex by TLGluMR interaction on RAVLT performance in the overall sample
and within diagnostic groups adjusting for age, education, and APOE e4 genotype.
Results: Across groups, female sex and higher TLGluMR and their interaction were associated
with better verbal memory (p values # 0.005). The female advantage in verbal memory varied
by TLGluMR such that the advantage was greatest among individuals with moderate to high
TLGluMR and minimal or absent among individuals with lower TLGluMR. Diagnosis-stratified
analyses revealed that this interaction was driven by the aMCI group (p values 5 0.009). The
interaction was not significant in control and AD dementia groups.
Conclusions: Women show better verbal memory than men in aMCI despite similar levels of brain
hypometabolism. The lifelong advantage that females show over males in verbal memory might
represent a form of cognitive reserve that delays verbal memory decline until more advanced
pathology, as indexed by TLGluMR. This issue is clinically important because verbal memory
scores are used in diagnosing aMCI and AD dementia. Neurology® 2016;87:1916–1924

The “cognitive reserve” theory proposes that persons with favorable premorbid factors (e.g.,
higher education, IQ) maintain normal cognitive function longer as Alzheimer-related brain
pathology accumulates.1,2 In those with higher cognitive reserve, the onset of accelerated
cognitive decline is delayed until time points closer to dementia diagnosis; however, once
decline begins, persons with high reserve have more rapid decline because pathology is more
advanced.1–5
Throughout life, females outperform males on verbal memory tests.6–8 This female advantage
may reflect a sex-specific form of cognitive reserve,9 masking brain pathology and an amnestic
mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) diagnosis in the early stages of dementia. Consistent with the
cognitive reserve theory, this advantage persists during preclinical stages of Alzheimer disease
(AD) including aMCI,10 but wanes during AD dementia suggesting accelerated decline in

 women vs men.10,11 This sex difference is clin-
ically relevant because cut scores on verbal
memory tests used in diagnosing aMCI and
AD dementia are typically not sex-adjusted.
The medial temporal lobe mediates verbal
memory12,13 and is an initial brain region to
exhibit AD-related neuropathology.14 Temporal
lobe glucose metabolic rates (TLGluMR), mea-
sured by [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose–PET (FDG-
PET), provide an in vivo measure of neural
dysfunction.15,16 We examined how the associa-
tion between verbal memory and TLGluMR
differs in women and men within and across
diagnostic groups (control, aMCI, AD demen-
tia). We hypothesized that the magnitude of the
female advantage in verbal memory would vary
by TLGluMR. Based on the cognitive reserve
theory, we predicted that women would out-
perform men on verbal memory at moderate to
high TLGluMR but that female advantage
would not be evident at low TLGluMR.
METHODS Participants and data source. Cross-sectional
data were extracted from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu) in June 2014.
Detailed information about ADNI can be found at www.adni-
info.org. ADNI began in 2004 as a longitudinal, multisite cohort
study that recruited healthy older adults, and individuals with
early or late MCI and early AD. See www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI
for recruitment procedures17 and www.adni-info.org/Scientists/

criteria.
About 50% of participants underwent FDG-PET imaging at
their baseline ADNI visit. A total of 1,334 participants had
concurrent diagnostic, TLGluMR, and verbal memory data
from one visit cycle as required for this study. Among the
1,334 participants, we excluded 18 individuals, including 9
individuals missing APOE genotype, 6 individuals with
evidence of brain infection, infarction, or other focal lesions
at the screening/baseline MRI, and 3 individuals with an
MCI diagnosis that did not meet standard criteria for aMCI
including objective memory impairment and a subjective
memory complaint.18 Our final sample comprised 1,316
participants (399 from ADNI1 and 917 from ADNIGO/2).
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. ADNI was approved by the institutional review board
at each site and was compliant with the Health Insurance Porta-
bility and Accountability Act. Written consent was obtained from
all participants.
Neuropsychological outcomes. Cognitive assessments in
ADNI included the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)19
to assess global cognitive function and the Clinical Dementia
Rating (CDR)20 to assess dementia severity. Verbal memory
measures were the Wechsler Memory Scale Logical Memory II
(LM-II), a paragraph recall test, and the Rey Auditory Verbal
Learning Test (RAVLT), a list-learning and memory test. A
female advantage is observed for both verbal memory tests in
ADNI; however, we used the RAVLT as our verbal memory
outcome because it is independent of diagnostic criteria. In the
RAVLT, the participant is read a list of 15 unrelated words and is
instructed to recall aloud as many words as possible.21 This
process is repeated for 5 learning trials (“immediate recall
score,” range 0–75). Then, an interference list of 15 words
unrelated to the first list and to each other is read aloud and
the participant is asked to recall aloud as many of these words
as possible. The participant is then asked to recall the first word
list. After a 30-minute delay in which only nonverbal tasks are
administered, the participant is again asked to recall as many
words from the first list as possible (“delayed recall score,”
range 0–15). The immediate and delayed recall scores were our
primary score outcomes.
Diagnostic criteria. An AD dementia diagnosis in ADNI
required an MMSE score between 20 and 26, a CDR of 0.5 or
1, and a probable diagnosis of AD dementia by the NINCDS/
ADRDA (National Institute of Neurological and Communicative
Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders
Association)22 criteria. An aMCI diagnosis required an MMSE
score between 24 and 30, a CDR of 0.5, a subjective memory
complaint, and objective memory loss as measured by education-
adjusted scores on the LM-II, without significant impairment in
other cognitive domains or functional impairment. A diagnosis of
early vs late aMCI differentiates modest from advanced
impairment on delayed recall of LM-II.23 Classification as
“normal” required an MMSE score between 24 and 30 and
a CDR of 0.
FDG-PET. FDG data were collected as 6 3 5–minute frames
30 minutes after injection of 5 mCi of FDG. Images were preprocessed
at the University of Michigan, following a standard procedure
described at the following website: http://adni.loni.usc.edu/methods/
pet-analysis/pre-processing/. Fully processed images were downloaded
from ADNI (http://adni.loni.ucla.edu/). ADNI investigators at the
University of California, Berkeley, established FDG-PET regions of
interest (ROIs) based on a meta-analysis of studies identifying brain
regions most frequently demonstrating metabolic changes in AD or
correlated with cognitive performance.24,25 Five ROIs were established,
labeled “MetaROIs,” that were located in bilateral posterior cingulate
gyrus, bilateral angular gyri, and middle/inferior temporal gyrus. For
our primary analysis, we used data from the middle/inferior temporal
ROI denoted here as TLGluMR because this region mediates verbal
memory12,13 and temporal hypometabolism is associated with poorer
verbal memory performance.26 For our secondary analysis, we used
MetaROI data to determine whether effects are specific to the
temporal lobe or generalize to other regions that demonstrate AD-
associated metabolic change. The protocol for image analysis is
described
at
the
following
website:
http://www.adni-info.org/
Scientists/ADNIStudyProcedures.aspx. FDG uptake measures were
normalized
to
a
reference
region
including
the
pons
and
cerebellum.24,25
Statistical analysis. Differences between sexes in demographic
characteristics and variables of interest (RAVLT scores and
TLGluMR) were examined in the overall sample and within diag-
nostic group using independent t tests for continuous variables
and x2 tests for categorical variables. In the overall sample, we
used multivariable linear regression to test the independent and
interactive associations of sex and TLGluMR for both RAVLT
outcomes (immediate and delayed recall). Analyses covaried for
age, education, APOE status, and diagnostic group. APOE status
was dichotomized as APOE e4 carriers vs noncarriers. In the
initial model, we examined the independent effects of sex and
TLGluMR on RAVLT outcomes. In the second model, a sex by
TLGluMR interaction term was added, but was excluded if not
significant (p . 0.05). In secondary analyses, we used the same

 statistical approach to examine the independent and interactive
associations of sex and TLGluMR on RAVLT immediate and
delayed recall but we stratified by diagnostic group instead of
covarying for diagnostic group. Given our previous finding of
a stronger relationship between verbal memory and hippocampal
volume ratio (HpVR: hippocampal volume/intracranial volume)
in women vs men, we repeated analyses adjusting for HpVR to
determine whether HpVR accounted for the TLGluMR 3 sex
interactions on RAVLT. Analyses were repeated substituting the
MetaROI FDG-PET data for TLGluMR to determine whether
effects generalize to other AD-related regions.
RESULTS Sample characteristics. Among 1,316 par-
ticipants, there were 390 controls, 672 with aMCI
(299 early aMCI, 373 late aMCI), and 254 with AD
dementia (tables 1 and 2). In the overall sample,
women were younger, less educated, and less likely
to be white compared to men (p values , 0.05).
Within all diagnostic groups, women were younger
and less educated than men (p values , 0.05). In
analyses adjusting for age, education, and APOE e4,
women outperformed men on RAVLT immediate
recall in the overall sample and within each group (p
values , 0.01). Women performed better on delayed
recall compared to men (p , 0.001) in the overall
sample; however, in diagnosis-stratified analyses, the
female advantage was evident only in controls and in
the aMCI group (p values # 0.001) but not the AD
dementia group. Overall, TLGluMR was higher in
women vs men; however, this sex difference in
TLGluMR was not significant within any diagnostic
group.
Linear regression results: Overall sample. Our hypothe-
sis that the magnitude of the female advantage in ver-
bal memory would vary by TLGluMR was supported
by a significant TLGluMR by sex interaction for both
immediate (p 5 0.005) and delayed recall (p 5
0.002; table 3) in the overall sample (figures 1A
and 2A). Better immediate recall was associated with
higher TLGluMR in both men and women; however,
this association was stronger in women compared to
men for immediate recall (B [unstandardized coeffi-
cient] 5 8.89, b [standardized coefficient] 5 0.21,
SE 5 1.40, p , 0.0001 for women vs B 5 4.01, b 5
0.09, SE 5 1.24, p 5 0.001 for men). This is reflected
in the greater slope of immediate recall across TLGluMR
in women vs men (figure 1A). Better delayed recall was
associated with higher TLGluMR in women only (B 5
2.19, b 5 0.15, SE 5 0.53, p , 0.001 for women vs
B 5 0.01, b 5 0.05, SE 5 0.46, p 5 0.78 for men).
This is reflected in the female-specific slope of delayed
recall across TLGluMR (figure 2A). The female
advantage on immediate and delayed recall was most
apparent in the medium to high range of TLGluMR
(right side of the x-axis), whereas verbal memory
performance converges for men and women with
lower TLGluMR (left side of the x-axis). When we
added HpVR as a covariate to analyses in the overall
sample, HpVR was a significant predictor of both
outcomes (p values , 0.001), and the TLGluMR 3
sex interactions remained significant for both immediate
(B 5 5.93, SE 5 1.95, p 5 0.002) and delayed recall
(B 5 2.21, SE 5 0.72, p 5 0.002).
Linear regression analyses: Diagnosis-stratified. In
diagnosis-stratified analyses, the TLGluMR by sex
interaction
was
significant
in
aMCI
for
both
immediate (p 5 0.009) and delayed (p 5 0.009)
recall (figures 1C and 2C), but not AD dementia
(figures 1D and 2D) or control groups (figures 1B
and 2B). Consistent with the overall sample, the
association between TLGluMR and RAVLT was
stronger in women with aMCI compared to men
with aMCI for immediate recall (B 5 9.98, b 5
0.24, SE 5 2.23, p , 0.0001 for women vs B 5
2.59, b 5 0.06, SE 5 1.86, p 5 0.17 for men) and
for delayed recall (B 5 3.35, b 5 0.22, SE 5 0.87,
p , 0.001 for women vs B 5 0.46, b 5 0.03, SE 5
0.73, p 5 0.52 for men). Figures 1C and 2C show
that the female advantage on immediate and delayed
recall in aMCI is most apparent in the medium to
high range of TLGluMR (right side of the x-axis),
whereas performance converges for men and women
with lower TLGluMR (left side of the x-axis).
Conversely, in controls, women outperformed men
on immediate (p , 0.0001) and delayed (p ,
0.0001)
recall
irrespective
of
TLGluMR
and
TLGluMR was not associated with immediate recall
(p 5 0.69) or delayed recall (p 5 0.20) (figures 1B
and 2B). In AD dementia, women outperformed men
in immediate recall irrespective of TLGluMR (p 5
0.0006; figure 1D), but not delayed recall (p 5 0.60;
figure 2D). In AD dementia, higher TLGluMR was
associated with better immediate recall irrespective

DISCUSSION We examined the association of sex,
TLGluMR, and their interaction with verbal memory
performance to evaluate whether the female advantage
in verbal memory might represent a form of cognitive
reserve. Consistent with the broader literature, women
outperformed men on immediate and delayed recall in
the overall sample.6–8 Consistent with previous stud-
ies,26,27 higher TLGluMR was related to better mem-
ory performance in the overall sample; however, the
association between TLGluMR and verbal memory
significantly differed by sex in the overall sample. Spe-
cifically, the female advantage was most apparent
among individuals with medium to high TLGluMR,
indicating neural dysfunction of none to moderate.
The advantage was attenuated among individuals with
lower TLGluMR, indicating more advanced neural
dysfunction.
Diagnosis-stratified analyses revealed that results
in the overall sample were driven by the significant

ilar levels of brain hypometabolism. Consistent with
the current results, we previously showed that women
have a verbal memory advantage over men despite
moderate hippocampal volume loss across diagnostic
groups and within the aMCI group.9 Together, the
results suggest that the female advantage in verbal
memory is sustained despite hippocampal atrophy
and metabolic deficits in the aMCI stage of AD,
but is eliminated when hippocampal atrophy and
metabolic deficits become more severe.
We found similar results when we used FDG-PET
data from a MetaROI that characterizes AD-
associated metabolic change. As TLGluMR and
MetaROI were highly correlated (R 5 0.95, p ,
0.001), this result is expected. The similar results
between analyses using TLGluMR or MetaROI sug-
gest that TLGluMR is more a marker for AD-
associated hypometabolism than a region-specific
marker for temporal dysfunction.
Among controls, the female advantage in verbal
memory was evident regardless of TLGluMR, and
memory performance was not related to TLGluMR.
The lack of a relationship between TLGluMR and
memory performance in healthy, older adults is con-
sistent with previous studies28 and may reflect limited
variability in TLGluMR among controls (SD 5 0.21)

 compared to aMCI (SD 5 0.26) or AD (SD 5 0.30)
groups or a threshold effect, whereby TLGluMR is
not associated with memory if above a certain level.
In AD dementia, our hypothesis that the female
advantage in verbal memory would be eliminated
among individuals with low TLGluMR was partly sup-
ported. The advantage was eliminated in delayed recall;
however, a floor effect limits interpretation. Counter to
hypotheses, female patients with AD dementia signifi-
cantly outperformed male patients with AD dementia
on immediate recall (p 5 0.0008); however, the sex
difference was smaller (mean difference 5 2.8) com-
pared to control (mean difference 5 4.8) and aMCI
(mean difference 5 6.3) groups. Our results suggest an
attenuation of the female advantage in verbal memory
in AD dementia and not an elimination or reversal as
some previous studies have indicated.10,11 Poorer imme-
diate recall scores were significantly associated with
lower TLGluMR among patients with AD dementia;
however, delayed recall scores were not associated, likely
because of the floor effect among delayed recall scores in
AD dementia.
We suggest that the female advantage in verbal
memory may represent a sex-specific form of cogni-
tive reserve that allows women to better compensate
for brain pathology and maintain normal cognitive
performance. We show that the female advantage in
verbal memory is maintained despite similar levels
of temporal hypometabolism in women and men.
The cognitive reserve theory further posits that the
initiation of accelerated cognitive decline will occur
at more advanced disease stages in those with greater
reserve once neuropathology reaches a level that over-
whelms compensation strategies.1,2 Using a previously
employed cutoff for impairment on the RAVLT
(,37 on immediate recall29 and ,8 on delayed
recall30), women in the present study reached this
cutoff at a lower TLGluMR compared to men for
both immediate (;2.2 vs 2.6; figure 1A) and delayed
recall (;2.9 vs 3.7; figure 2A). Thus, consistent with
the cognitive reserve theory, verbal memory impair-
ment was evident at a greater degree of disease burden
as measured by TLGluMR in women vs men.
Some, but not all, studies31,32 report that men are
at higher risk of aMCI,33,34 whereas women are dis-
proportionally affected by AD dementia.35,36 Our re-
sults may help to explain this paradoxical sex
difference in aMCI and AD dementia rates. Verbal
memory tests are used in diagnosing aMCI and AD
dementia, and test norms are typically not sex-
adjusted. Among individuals who transition from
aMCI to AD dementia, the combination of a delay
in the clinical manifestation of verbal memory impair-
ment and more rapid decline thereafter in women vs
men would lead to a shorter window of time for an
aMCI diagnosis in women that may not be captured
in longitudinal assessments given every 1 to 2 years. In
ADNI, consistent with this view, among individuals
with aMCI, cognitive decline occurs 2 times faster in
women vs men.37 In addition, women in the Einstein
Aging Study were less likely to transition from control
to MCI but more likely to transition from normal to
dementia than men.38
Our study has limitations. Our cross-sectional
analysis precludes us from determining temporality
in the relationship between verbal memory and
TLGluMR. However, longitudinal studies indicate
that brain hypometabolism is a marker for impending
cognitive decline and incident MCI.16,39 In this cross-
sectional design, we could not compare rates of
decline between men and women; these rates would
provide a more direct test of the cognitive reserve
theory. Longitudinal analyses are under way that
examine sex differences in the trajectory of verbal
memory decline in the path to AD dementia. Lastly,
because ADNI is based on a convenience sample of
predominately white and well-educated volunteers,
generalizability of results is limited.
We found that the magnitude of the female advan-
tage in verbal memory varies across TLGluMR. Spe-
cifically, the female advantage in verbal memory was
evident despite minimal to moderate temporal hypo-
metabolism; however, the advantage was attenuated
when hypometabolism was more severe. Given simi-
lar findings with hippocampal volume,9 we show that
women show better verbal memory performance than
men despite moderate levels of brain pathophysiology
based on structural and functional neuroimaging out-
comes. The female advantage in verbal memory may
serve as a sex- and domain-specific form of cognitive
reserve. If replicated, results suggest that aMCI may
be clinically detected at a more advanced disease stage
in women vs men because women are better able to
compensate for underlying neuropathology. Imple-
menting sex-adjusted norms in clinical verbal mem-
ory tests may improve the early detection of AD in
women.

MACRA Changes How Neurologists Are Paid
What Is MACRA, and Why Is It Necessary?
The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015—MACRA—replaced the
Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate formula for calculating physician payments. The rapidly rising
costs of health care in the US are unsustainable. Changes in the health care system are essential and
must happen now.
How Will MACRA Affect Physician Payment?
Our health care system is moving from “fee-for-service” payments to a wider array of “value-based”
payment models that put the patient at the center of care by calling for the improvement of the
quality, safety, and overall experience of patient care while demonstrating cost-effectiveness by
providing care that is less expensive and delivers similar or improved clinical outcomes.
