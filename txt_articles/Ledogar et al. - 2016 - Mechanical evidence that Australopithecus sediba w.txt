Australopithecus sediba has been hypothesized to be a close relative of the genus Homo. Here
we show that MH1, the type specimen of A. sediba, was not optimized to produce high molar
bite force and appears to have been limited in its ability to consume foods that were
mechanically challenging to eat. Dental microwear data have previously been interpreted as
indicating that A. sediba consumed hard foods, so our findings illustrate that mechanical data
are essential if one aims to reconstruct a relatively complete picture of feeding adaptations in
extinct hominins. An implication of our study is that the key to understanding the origin of
Homo lies in understanding how environmental changes disrupted gracile australopith niches.
Resulting selection pressures led to changes in diet and dietary adaption that set the stage for
the emergence of our genus.

ecent
years
have
seen
a
number
of
increasingly
sophisticated studies1–7 directed towards reconstructing
the diets of australopiths (extinct early humans from the
Plio-Pleistocene
of
Africa).
These
studies
suggest
that
australopiths exhibit dietary diversity both within and between
species,
and
challenge
conventional
wisdom
concerning
australopith dietary adaptations that have traditionally been
based on assessments of functional anatomy8,9. Consequently, a
lively debate has ensued concerning the efficacy of functional
studies10–12. We demonstrate here that mechanical evidence
provides insights into the dietary adaptations of Australopithecus
sediba
that
could
not
have
been
obtained
from
dietary
reconstructions that do not consider functional anatomy. These
insights may elucidate some of the selective factors that led to the
origin of our genus. Indeed, even though the precise phylogenetic
relationships of A. sediba are a matter of debate (competing
hypotheses place it as either the sister taxon of Homo13 or a
phyletic descendant of A. africanus lacking a close relationship
with early Homo taxa14), we show that the adaptive implications
of its feeding mechanics are the same in all relevant phylogenetic
scenarios.
Australopithecus sediba, known from Malapa in southern
Africa13, is unlike other australopiths in that it has comparatively
small molar and premolar teeth, lacks large muscle markings, and
exhibits only a few traits that might increase muscle leverage and/
or buttress the face13,15. Yet, despite its apparent gracility, dental
microwear analysis suggests that its diet included hard foods7.
Such foods presumably would be fractured on the molars and
premolars using high bite forces (if they were instead fractured
using stone tools, then microwear would not detect evidence of
hard-object feeding). Thus, dietary evidence seems to be at odds
with conventional interpretations of functional anatomy. We test
the hypothesis that the facial skeleton of A. sediba is well
configured (and, possibly, adapted) to consume hard foods. This
hypothesis predicts that the cranium of A. sediba is structurally
strong in response to feeding loads, and that it is able to efficiently
generate high bite forces on its molars and premolars.
We tested hypotheses about feeding biomechanics using finite
element analysis (FEA), an engineering technique useful for
examining the specific functional consequences of cranial shape
variation16. A finite element model (FEM) of the A. sediba
holotype cranium (MH1) was virtually reconstructed to correct
for damaged, displaced or missing parts. This model was
compared with a FEM of A. africanus, a composite model of
Sts 5, and Sts 52a and b10,17. Sts 5 was also used to reconstruct the
missing occipital region of MH1, so both models are composites.
However, occipital morphology does not figure in the mechanical
analyses reported here. For simplicity, the A. africanus and
A. sediba FEMs are referred to here as the specimens on which
they are primarily based, namely Sts 5 and MH1, respectively.
Both models were subjected to loads simulating maximal bites on
the left upper third premolar (P3) and left upper second molar
(M2), under the assumption that the chewing muscles were acting
at peak activity levels on both sides of the cranium. These loads
allow an estimate of the maximum bite force produced by each
individual. We have previously shown that FEA of primate crania
can produce maximum bite force calculations within 5% of values
recorded during in vivo experiments10. Muscle force magnitudes
were scaled such that bone strain differences in the two models
reflect differences in cranial shape but not size18. FEA simulates
rather than directly measures the forces, stresses and strains
associated with behaviours performed by living organisms, so
results from FEA are approximate. However, a great analytical
strength of FEA is that it allows researchers to test questions
under absolutely controlled conditions at a level of complexity
beyond what can generally be achieved in a laboratory setting,
especially when examining extinct taxa known only from fossils.
We use FEA to show that the cranium of A. sediba is not
optimized to produce high molar bite forces and therefore is
unlikely to have been adapted to eat hard foods.
Results
Strain and bite force. Our results show that the facial skeleton of
A. sediba specimen MH1 was strong relative to that of A. afri-
canus specimen Sts 5 even though the former lacks many of the
derived facial buttressing features seen in other australopiths.
With a few exceptions, strain magnitudes from homologous
locations on the FEMs were lower in the A. sediba model than in
the A. africanus model during both premolar and molar biting
(Figs 1 and 2). Nearly, all regions we examined experienced lower
strain magnitudes in A. sediba for all forms of strain during both
premolar (Supplementary Table 1) and molar (Supplementary

 Table 2) biting. The only exceptions to this are that A. sediba
exhibited slightly higher maximum principal (tensile) strain
in the balancing-side zygomatic root during both premolar
and molar biting. The magnitude of minimum principal (com-
pressive) strain was greater in the balancing dorsal orbital,
working infraorbital and working zygomatic body regions of
MH1, for both bites. There was also somewhat higher maximum
shear strain in the working infraorbital during premolar biting,
and somewhat higher shear and von Mises strain in the balancing
dorsal orbital of MH1. However, for the infraorbital region,
A. africanus exhibits a region of high strain just medial to where
the working infraorbital strain was collected that extends from the
inferior orbital rim to the root of the zygomatic. This is likely
related to the more curved zygomaticoalveolar crest of Sts 5
combined with its more laterally flaring zygoma. Strain energy
density in the balancing dorsal orbitals of A. sediba and
A. africanus were identical. Strain mode also differed slightly
between the models. Strain mode for the working postorbital bar
was somewhat more compressive in A. sediba during premolar
biting, as opposed to being tensile in A. africanus. In addition,
the balancing mid-zygomatic arch of A. sediba was tensed
slightly more than it was compressed during both premolar
and molar biting, while compression was dominant in the arch of
A. africanus.
Although
Sts
5
experiences
systematically
higher
strain
magnitudes than MH1, the extent of the differences between
these two hominins does not exceed that observed among a
sample of chimpanzees that differ notably in shape (Fig. 1);
strains in Sts 5 are often towards the high end or middle of the
chimpanzee range, while those in MH1 are consistently toward
the bottom of or below that range. Thus, although one can
conclude that MH1 is strong relative to the other crania, more
work is needed to determine whether or not that strength reflects
a species-level property differentiating A. sediba from chimpan-
zees and A. africanus.
Moreover, the spatial patterning of strains in MH1 and Sts 5 is
similar. It is possible to visualize the spatial patterning of strains
by altering the scales of the colour maps such that they range

Sts 5 (A. africanus) and MH1 (A. sediba) crania during simulated left
premolar (P3) and left molar (M2) biting (not to scale). Colour maps
on the top half of the figure reflect absolute strain magnitudes ranging from
0 to 1,000 microstrain (me), where white regions experience strain
magnitudes that exceed 1,000 me. Colour maps on the bottom half of the
figures reflect relative strain magnitudes where the colour scale of each
model ranges from 0 to a value equal to twice the average of strain
magnitudes collected from 10 standard locations from which strain data
have been collected during in vivo feeding experiments in primates29. These
relative strain maps provide information about the distribution of relatively
high and relatively low strain concentrations independent of the scale of the
strain magnitudes. For the molar biting analysis, it was necessary to rerun
the model of MH1 with the balancing (non-biting) side muscle forces
reduced by nearly 30% in order to remove a distractive (tensile) reaction
force at the working (biting) side jaw joint. Therefore, under the column for
molar biting, the model of MH1 is shown loaded with bilaterally
symmetrical muscle forces (left), as well as with asymmetrical muscle
forces (right).

*MH1 was analysed twice using scaled chimpanzee muscle forces, once with bilaterally symmetrical muscle forces and once with asymmetrical muscle forces. This was necessary because the MH1 FEM
exhibited an unrealistic distractive reaction force at the working (biting) side TMJ during molar biting with symmetrical muscle forces. To remove the distractive reaction force, it was necessary to reduce
the balancing (non-biting) muscle forces by nearly 30% and rerun the simulation of molar biting. The analysis using asymmetrical forces is a more realistic simulation of molar biting in this specimen.

 from zero to a value equal to twice the average of 10 regions from
which strain data were collected (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2,
regions 1–5 and 8–12; regions 6 and 7 are excluded because strain
values in those regions are highly variable). The most notable
difference is that Sts 5 lacks well-defined strain concentrations in
the body of the zygomatic, which exhibits a distinct prominence.
The similarities in strain distribution suggest that although the
hominins considered here belong to different species, they appear
to share at least aspects of an underlying architecture that results
in their crania performing biomechanically in similar ways
despite evident variation in morphology, particularly with respect
to facial projection and the shape and relative position of the
zygomatic.
As
defined
using
a
conventional
taxonomy,
A. africanus exhibits variation in facial projection and zygomatic
root morphology (for example, specimens Sts 5 versus Sts 71),
and we hypothesize that the modelling of additional individuals
in this species will reveal corresponding variation in facial strain
magnitudes (with some individuals possibly resembling A. sediba)
but broad similarities in strain patterning. Such work should also
establish whether or not the distribution of strain concentrations
in MH1 differs from those of the other A. africanus specimens in
the same, subtle way that it differs from Sts 5.
During simulated maximal bites with bilaterally symmetrical
external forces representing fully active muscles, A. sediba
exhibited bite forces broadly similar to those of A. africanus at
the P3 and M2 (Table 1). The efficiency of bite force production,
as measured by mechanical advantage (the ratio of bite force
output to muscle force input) was slightly lower in A. sediba
during premolar biting, but higher during molar biting compared
with A. africanus.
These results have not been biased by the subadult age of MH1.
Previous studies have demonstrated in apes19, monkeys20 and
other hominins19,21–24 that developmental changes in overall
cranial morphology that occur subsequent to first molar eruption
produce relatively minor variations in shape relative to the
changes that occur earlier in ontogeny. Moreover, one study in
Old World monkeys has shown that many (although not all)
components of the masticatory system exhibit consistent spatial
relationships with each other during growth from juvenile stages
to
adulthood25.
Our
geometric
morphometric
analysis
of
ontogenetic change in African apes and humans suggests that
the important functional relationships in MH1 among the
dentition, malar root and temporomandibular joint (TMJ)
would likewise have not changed markedly during the later
stages of development. These are key landmarks to consider
because collectively they affect the relative positioning of critical
components of the biomechanical system, namely, the point of
loading (that is, the bite point), some of the applied external
forces (that is, the masseter muscle) and the fulcrum (TMJ). If, for
example, the positions of the tooth row relative to the zygomatic
root and TMJ were markedly different in adults compared with
juveniles of the age of MH1, then results derived from MH1
might have limited utility in characterizing the mechanics of the
species. However, relative to African ape juveniles lacking
permanent teeth, those individuals with the second molar in
occlusion have nearly achieved the adult configuration in these
features (Fig. 3a). And, while subsequent ontogenetic changes are
measurable, they do not substantially alter the arrangement of the
masticatory apparatus (Fig. 3b). In other words, even if MH1 had
lived to grow along the ontogenetic trajectory of an extant ape,
the resulting adult form would have been very similar to that
preserved in the existing fossil with respect to the morphological
features under consideration. Moreover, even though A. sediba is
represented in this study by a single individual, prior work on
chimpanzee crania has shown that mechanical variation within
species is conservative even when intraspecific shape variation is
high26. Thus, even though it is always desirable to examine more
specimens (particularly in fossil taxa), there is reason to believe
that these results are broadly applicable to the species as a whole,
with the caveat that mechanical variation at approximately the
level seen in chimpanzees might be expected.
Constraints. On balance, one might conclude that the cranium of
MH1 is well configured to consume hard foods, insofar as its
facial skeleton is structurally strong (notwithstanding sampling
limitations) and it appears to produce bite force efficiently.
However, there is an important constraint on bite force pro-
duction that argues against this interpretation. In this ‘con-
strained lever’ model27,28 (Fig. 4), it is assumed that the two TMJs
are loaded in compression (in which the mandibular condyles are
drawn into the joints). This will occur when the vector resultant
of all of the masticatory muscle forces passes through a ‘triangle
of support’ defined by the bite point and the two TMJs. If,
however, the muscle resultant were to fall outside of the triangle
of support, then the working (biting) side TMJ would experience
a distractive reaction force in which the condyle is ‘pulled’ out of
the joint. The soft tissues of the TMJ are poorly configured to
resist distractive joint forces, and thus could be damaged if the
joint were to dislocate in this manner.
The muscle resultant will fall in the midline (that is, the
midsagittal plane) when the muscles of mastication are acting
with bilateral symmetry (equal forces on both sides)27,28. As a
generalization, such a midline muscle resultant passes through
the triangle of support during bites on the mesial teeth (that is,
incisors, canines and premolars). Thus, the model27 does not
predict distraction during bites on such teeth. However, as the
bite point moves distally on the tooth row towards the molars, the
shape of the triangle of support changes such that a midline
muscle resultant may lie outside of the triangle (Fig. 4), and thus
create a distractive joint force. To bring the resultant within the

 triangle, one can reduce the activity levels of the balancing
(non-biting) side muscles27,28. This has the effect of moving the
muscle resultant towards the working side and back within
the triangle (Fig. 4). In such bites, there is an asymmetry in the
activity levels of the working and balancing-side muscles, a
consequence of which is that overall muscle force is reduced.
Thus, although one might expect that a bite on a distal tooth
might produce an elevated bite force, this expectation is mitigated
by the constraint that muscle force may be reduced during such a
bite to prevent joint distraction. In theory, there is an alternative
means of moving the muscle resultant into the triangle of
support, namely, by reducing the anterior-most fibres of each
muscle so as to move the muscle resultant posteriorly. This is
difficult to model but, regardless, the effect on bite force is the
same: reduced muscle forces necessarily imply reduced bite
forces.
Taxa in which the molar teeth are positioned antero-
posteriorly close to the TMJs (that is, as in a species with a
retracted face) are especially at risk of having a midline muscle
resultant fall outside of the triangle of support and this problem is
exacerbated if those taxa also have masticatory muscles that are
positioned anteriorly28. Thus, it is a paradox that a feeding
apparatus configured precisely in a way that increases mechanical
advantage (that is, by increasing the leverage of the chewing
muscles while simultaneously reducing the load arm of the bite
point) is also subject to a constraint requiring a reduction in
balancing-side muscle force that limits bite force production. The
molar teeth in A. sediba are positioned relatively close to the
TMJs13, and the origin of the masseter muscle is positioned
towards the mesial end (rather than the middle) of the molar row
(Fig. 5). Thus, one might expect that A. sediba was at risk of
experiencing distractive joint forces during molar biting.
In our FEA simulations, the TMJs on the working (biting) sides
of both the Sts 5 and MH1 crania experience compressive
reaction forces during premolar biting, as predicted by biome-
chanical models27,28. This indicates that the jaw adductor muscle
resultant vector passed safely through the triangle of support. Sts
5 similarly exhibits a faintly compressive reaction force during
molar biting, which is consistent with the hypothesis that
anthropoid primates may be buffered against TMJ distraction
as
muscle
activity
levels
vary
dynamically
during
molar
mastication28. However, the working-side TMJ of the MH1
cranium experiences a distractive reaction force during maximal
molar biting (Fig. 5; Table 1). Only one of the six chimpanzee
models experiences a distractive TMJ force29, and in that
individual the absolute value of the distractive force was an
order of magnitude less than that recorded in MH1. Mammals
avoid distractive TMJ reaction forces by reducing the activity
levels of the chewing muscles on the balancing (non-biting) side
of the skull27,28. The exact pattern by which they do this is
difficult to predict, but it was found that when the balancing-side
muscle forces in MH1 were all equally reduced by nearly 30%,
then the MH1 model produced a working-side joint reaction
force during molar biting that was not distractive (Table 1), and
that had an orientation similar to that of Sts 5. This reduction in
muscle forces in MH1 resulted in a maximum bite force that was
reduced by B15%. We expect that in life, both A. africanus and
A. sediba would have exhibited further reductions in balancing-
side muscle force to maintain a safety factor to avoid dislocating
the working-side TMJ28, as has been observed in modern
humans30. Indeed, the nearly 30% value falls comfortably
within the dispersion of experimental values observed during
biting on the distal-most molar in modern humans30, who can
exhibit even a 50% reduction (note that in MH1, the second
molar is its distal-most tooth owing to its subadult age). Because
scaled chimpanzee muscle forces are only a coarse proxy for
muscle forces in the model of MH1, it is possible that differences
in muscle size and/or force ratios could impact the results for the
TMJ reaction forces, and potentially the conclusions relating to
constraints on feeding biomechanics in A. sediba. To examine this
further, we ran the premolar and molar biting simulations in
MH1 a third time, using the muscle forces of another closely
related species, Homo sapiens. Using these forces, it was found
that
balancing-side

to
eliminate distraction at the working side were only half those
needed when using chimpanzee forces (Supplementary Table 3).

(masticatory) muscles remains within the triangle (passing into the plane of

mandible is elevated. However, during some molar bites (b), the MRV falls
outside the triangle when the muscles are being recruited equally on both

distraction (red circle) at the WS TMJ. To eliminate the distraction, the
recruitment of the balancing-side muscles must be lessened, thereby
causing the MRV to shift its position towards the working side (arrow).
Once the MRV falls back within the triangle, then the WS TMJ will be in
compression. A consequence of reducing the recruitment of the balancing-
side muscles is that the magnitude of the bite force is reduced.

zygomatic root (off of which the masseter muscle arises) is more mesially
positioned relative to the tooth row in MH1 than Sts 5. Models are not
shown to scale.

 more limited in MH1 than in Sts 5, and that the feeding
apparatus in MH1 is not well buffered against TMJ distraction
during molar chewing. Although MH1 would likely have been
able to produce bite forces high enough to fracture some hard
foods, our simulation suggests that the cranium of this specimen
is not optimized to produce high bite force on the molars.
Moreover, while MH1 could have efficiently produced bite force
on the premolars, the presence of small premolar teeth in the
conspecific specimen MH2 argues against the likelihood that
premolar loading of hard foods with a high bite force was a
significant behavior in A. sediba because the size of a tooth limits
its maximum strength31. Thus, if these specimens are broadly
representative of the species, our results do not support a
hypothesis that A. sediba was adapted to eat hard foods. Previous
analyses of carbon isotopes and dental calculus reveal that MH1
may have had a varied diet consisting of the tissues (including
bark) of a range of plants utilizing the C3 photosynthetic
pathway7. Our findings are consistent with this hypothesis, but
suggest that hard-object feeding may not have been a behaviour
that drove craniofacial evolution in A. sediba.
Discussion
Dental microwear analysis suggests that MH1 and MH2 may
have eaten hard foods shortly before their deaths7, and that
microwear in these specimens resembles that of Paranthropus
robustus, for which it is claimed1 that hard foods were a critical
dietary resource consumed during parts of the year. Our
mechanical data do not dispute the possibility that A. sediba
occasionally ate hard foods (notwithstanding disagreements
about how to interpret microwear data32), but limitations on
bite force production suggest that hard foods needing to be
processed with high bite forces were not a selectively important
component of the diet of this species. This interpretation is
consistent with the presence of smaller (and, thus, weaker31)
cheek teeth in A. sediba than in many other australopiths.
Moreover, insofar as MH1 was especially vulnerable to TMJ
distraction, one can infer that molar bite forces in A. sediba would
have been habitually low to minimize the magnitude of the joint
forces. This implies that the foods most important to its survival
may not have been mechanically challenging to process in the
oral cavity. Thus, the dietary reconstruction of A. sediba based on
dental microwear7 could be correct, yet not fully elucidate the
nature of dietary adaptations in this species.
Our results highlight the influence of functional constraints on
reconstructions of adaptations in extinct organisms; it may be as
informative to consider the ways in which a given morphology
limits behaviour as it is to consider how it allows a behaviour.
Those limitations critically affect our assessments of adaptive
hypotheses. Such hypotheses can be tested only by examining all
relevant sources of information, including not only direct
evidence of behaviour but also functional anatomy.
The phylogenetic relationships of A. sediba are a topic of
debate. It has been hypothesized that A. sediba lies near the
ancestry of Homo or is otherwise a close phylogenetic relative of
the Homo clade13, but it has also been asserted that A. sediba is
instead a phyletic descendant of A. africanus lacking especially
close affinities to Homo14. Under both scenarios, our study has
similar implications for the origin of Homo. If A. sediba and
Homo are closely related, and if specimens drawn from the base
of the Homo radiation exhibit limitations on molar bite force
production similar to that found in A. sediba (as would be likely
in Homo specimens exhibiting facial retraction), then it is
reasonable to infer that these shared biomechanical constraints
(caused especially by a short horizontal distance between the
molar teeth and the TMJs) and their attendant behavioural
limitations characterize the ancestors of our genus. These
ancestors
were
almost
certainly
descended
from
gracile
australopiths, for example, refs 13,33–38, who had adaptations
for feeding on mechanically resistant foods, for example, refs
8–10,29,39,40.
In
this
scenario,
we
hypothesize
that
environmental
change
in
the
late
Pliocene
and/or
early
Pleistocene41–43
disrupted
the
ecological
niches
of
gracile
australopiths necessitating changes in dietary ecology. One
clade
of
descendants
accentuated
adaptations
for
eating
mechanically resistant foods for example, ref. 29, and evolved
into the robust australopiths of the genus Paranthropus. Another
clade (including A. sediba) seemingly abandoned the ability to
process such foods orally and one lineage within this clade
evolved into Homo. Large brains evidently do not characterize all
members of this clade (for example, MH1), so the onset of this
evolutionary trajectory may have preceded the evolution of brain
expansion that so markedly characterizes our genus.
Alternatively, if A. sediba and Homo lack a close phylogenetic
relationship, then any biomechanical similarities shared by them
must have evolved in parallel. This would be consistent with a
hypothesis that some gracile australopith populations were
experiencing selection favouring craniodental reduction, even as
the robust australopiths were evolving along an opposite
trajectory. Thus, even if A. sediba and Homo were descended
from different gracile australopith ancestors, it is evident that one
must understand the dietary selective pressures that influenced
the ancestors that preceded the earliest members of Homo if one
is to understand the origin of the genus.
Methods
Model construction. A completely closed (‘watertight’) virtual reconstruction of
the MH1 cranium suitable for FEA was constructed in Geomagic Studio 2012
(Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) three-dimensional (3D) surface editing
software from a stereolithography-formatted surface mesh rendered from
computed tomography (CT) scans of the original specimen. This surface
reconstruction was used to generate a FEM. Although the individual represented by
the MH1 cranium is juvenile, any additional growth is unlikely to have significantly
altered its morphology (see below).
The MH1 cranium is missing most of its right parietal, much of the posterior
aspect of the right zygomatic arch, and the occipital. Regions preserved on the
contralateral side, including the parietal and zygomatic arch, were reflected to the
missing side (Supplementary Fig. 1). Missing teeth, with the exception of the
central incisors, were also reflected from the opposite side. Central incisors were
incorporated into the model using a surface rendering of an isolated central incisor
attributed to the same individual (Supplementary Fig. 2). The occipital was
reconstructed by incorporating surfaces from our model of Sts 5 (A. africanus;
Supplementary Fig. 3). This region is not expected to play a role in feeding
biomechanics, so the incorporation of these parts should not affect our results in
any meaningful way.
There is some distortion to the sphenoid region of the model where it was
difficult to discern bone from the surrounding matrix. This also became difficult in
the frontal bone, so the frontal sinus was ultimately modelled from a scaled version
of the frontal sinus of Sts 5. Further, the unreconstructed cranium of MH1
preserves a minor displacement of the rostrum, with the face being slightly bent to
the left. Some of this displacement was corrected by rotating the displaced parts to
the right, such that the point between the central incisors was aligned with the
midsagittal plane (Supplementary Fig. 2). There is still some minor distortion to
the cranium; however, the current geometry of the reconstructed model is a first-
order approximation suitable for the purposes of our analysis.
The surface model of the reconstructed cranium was further refined in
Geomagic Studio. During this stage, small cracks, holes and other minor damage to
the cranium were corrected through light sanding and smoothing procedures. Any
additional geometric adjustments necessary for successful solid meshing of the
model, including the correction of overlapping or intersecting triangles, and
removal of surface polygons with unusually high aspect ratios were performed
using the same procedure. Volumes representing the trabecular bone (as opposed
to individual trabeculae) in the supraorbital region, zygomatic and midface
surrounding the tooth roots were also generated using Geomagic Studio. These
volumes were reconstructed using the MH1 CT data as a guide. However, the
clarity of the MH1 CT scans was somewhat too poor to precisely determine cortical
thickness in certain facial regions. The source of this problem is that mineral matrix
has partially or completely filled the cavities within the MH1 cranium, including
the spaces between trabeculae. When this happens, it is sometimes difficult to
discern the boundary between cortical bone (which has been mineralized) and the

 volume representing cancellous bone. Therefore, data on craniofacial cortical bone
thickness in chimpanzees and gorillas gathered during our analysis of extant ape
bone material properties26 were also used to determine reasonable cortical bone
thicknesses across the face. Cortical bone thickness in the MH1 FEM is
approximate.
The completed surface mesh of the MH1 cranium was then imported into the
3Matic module of Mimics v 14.0 (Materialise, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) for volume
meshing. The individual watertight volumes representing the cranial cortical bone,
trabecular bone in the supraorbital and zygomatic regions, and trabecular bone in
the maxilla were volume meshed using four-noded tetrahedral elements. The solid
mesh of the cranium was then imported as a Nastran file into Strand7 (Strand7 Pty
Ltd, Sydney, NSW) finite element software for assignment of material properties,
muscle forces and all loading simulations. The mandible of MH1 was also
reconstructed so that insertion points for the jaw adductors could be determined
(see below). Using Geomagic Studio, the mandibular molars of the right hemi-
mandible were aligned to the right maxillary molars, and the mandibular condyle
was inserted into the glenoid fossa. The mandible was then reflected to the missing
side (Supplementary Fig. 4).
Model creation for A. africanus followed a procedure similar to that described
above. Our model of A. africanus is an updated composite of Sts 5 and Sts 52a
described in a previous analysis10. This new model incorporates an altered spatial
relationship of the dentition following a new macrowear-based reconstruction of
the dental arches in Sts 52a and b16. Specifically, the teeth have been slightly
repositioned to better account for distortion in Sts 52a, and the tooth roots have
been more precisely aligned with the preserved apices of the alveoli of Sts 5. These
subtle changes are, for the purposes of this study, biomechanically insignificant.
The FEM of MH1 is available for download at www.biomesh.org.
Material properties. The material properties of cranial cortical bone in our FEMs
are averaged values from one chimpanzee and one gorilla specimen26 and were
obtained using an ultrasonic technique44,45 at 14 homologous locations46 across
the cranial vault and facial skeleton (Supplementary Fig. 5). Spatially heterogeneous
isotropic material properties were spread throughout the cortical volume of the
models in Strand7 software using a method47 analogous to the diffusion of heat
through a highly conductive material. To achieve this, each FEM was assigned
thermally conductive properties, allowing heat to diffuse smoothly throughout the
model (with any effect of temperature on stress resistance during the loading
analyses removed by assigning a thermal expansion of 0). Nodes at the 14 locations
on each side of the cranium were seeded with temperatures that correspond to their
respective elastic moduli (Supplementary Table 4), and the steady-state
(non-transient) thermal problem was solved to determine the temperature
distribution in the cranium (Supplementary Fig. 6). The elastic moduli of each
cortical volume at various locations across the face were then set to vary with the
changes in temperature during the loading analyses described below. Trabecular
bone and tooth crowns were assigned homogeneous isotropic material properties,
with moduli of 0.637 and 80 GPa, respectively, each with a Poisson’s ration of 0.3,
following our previous analyses10,26,29. Periodontal ligaments were not modelled
because our prior research has shown that the presence or absence of the
periodontal ligament does not have a major effect on global patterns of cranial
bone strain in a primate model48.
Muscle forces and loading conditions. Muscle forces were applied to both FEMs
for the anterior temporalis, superficial masseter, deep masseter and medial
pterygoid. Force magnitudes were estimated from the physiological cross-sectional
area of each of these muscles in an adult female chimpanzee10, but were scaled to
bone volume to the 2/3 power in each FEM to remove any size-related differences
in strain pattern or magnitude18. This focuses our comparison on the functional
consequences of differences in shape alone. Although the scaling of muscle forces
controls for the confounding effects of size, this approach necessarily requires the
assumption that the relative magnitudes of each of the muscles remains constant
across species. There is no reliable way of assessing this assumption because it has
been shown that bony muscle markings are an inaccurate indicator of muscle
cross-sectional area49, which is in turn related to maximum force magnitude. Thus,
to assess the sensitivity of the models to variation in relative muscle force
magnitudes, analyses were rerun using scaled human muscle forces. Human muscle
forces applied to the MH1 model were derived from data on muscle cross-sectional
area50 and adjusted using formulae that correct for the effects of gape during
fixation on sarcomere length51. Results were similar insofar as it was still found that
bilaterally symmetrical muscle forces produced distractive TMJ reaction forces
during molar bites, although less reduction in balancing-side muscle force was
needed to eliminate this distraction (Supplementary Table 3).
To apply muscle forces to the FEMs, plate elements were ‘zipped’ at their nodes
to surface elements representing each muscle’s origin. The scaled muscle forces
were applied to the plate elements using a software package (Boneload) that uses an
algorithm that applies both tangential and normal muscle tractions, accounting for
the added torque produced when muscles wrap around curved bone surfaces52.
These loads were directed towards their respective insertions on the mandible.
Muscle insertion points were defined as the 3D area centroid of each muscle’s
insertion area using Area Centroids (www.BioMesh.org). To account for changes in
muscle vector orientation during mouth opening, insertion points were determined
with the mandible of each FEM slightly depressed and with the condyles translated
onto the articular eminences53.
Each FEM was subjected to two primary loading experiments simulating
premolar and molar biting. For both analyses, the working-side TMJ was
constrained against translation in all directions, while the balancing-side TMJ was
constrained in the vertical and anteroposterior directions. This creates an axis of
rotation upon the application of muscle forces. During the premolar simulation, a
node in the centre of the occlusal surface of the left upper third premolar (P3) was
constrained in the vertical direction. The left upper second molar (M2) was
similarly constrained for the molar biting simulation. These constraints induce
deformation in the craniofacial skeleton and generate reaction forces at constrained
nodes when loaded by muscle forces.
Comparative sample of chimpanzees. FEMs were also constructed of a
comparative sample of chimpanzees. Due to the time-consuming nature of FEA,
this sample consisted of six individuals shown to differ markedly in morphology
(thereby bracketing a large proportion of intraspecific morphological variation).
Geometric morphometric methods were used to select these six specimens, and
those methods are described fully elsewhere26. Briefly, as part of a previous study54,
709 cranial landmarks and semilandmarks were digitized from 3D surfaces derived
from the CT scans of 21 adult chimpanzees, including 10 females, 9 males and 2
individuals of indeterminate sex. These specimens sample at least two chimpanzee
subspecies (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii and Pan troglodytes verus). The
(semi)landmark configurations were converted to shape coordinates by generalized
Procrustes analysis, and principal component analysis was then used to detect the
main patterns of shape variation across our chimpanzee sample26. The specimens
with the strongest positive and negative loadings along the first three principal
components (PCs) were selected for FEA, with the caveat that, by chance, the
specimens loading at the extreme ends of PC2 were associated with CT scans
whose quality was too poor for the purposes of building a model for FEA
(segmentation to reconstruct the full suite of internal and external geometry was
not feasible, although scans were sufficient for gathering shape data). Thus, on PC2,
we selected the specimens with the next most extreme loadings on both the positive
and negative axes.
Ontogenetic prediction and assessment of shape change in MH1. 3D landmark
data were analysed to assess the degree to which the MH1 facial morphology might
have changed during the final stages of ontogeny. Landmarks were chosen to test
the relative positions of the malar root, TMJ and dento-palatal morphology, which
are key features in the FEM. These include interdental alveolar landmarks between
all teeth from I1 to M2, the malar root origin, and the tip of the postglenoid process,
and were collected in the manner described by McNulty55. A cross-sectional
ontogenetic sample of 319 extant African apes and humans was used to represent
possible developmental trajectories for A. sediba (cf. samples in McNulty19);
polytypic species were represented by samples from only a single subspecies
(Gorilla gorilla gorilla and Pan troglodytes troglodytes). All landmark
configurations, including that of MH1, were superimposed using a generalized
Procrustes analysis to project specimens into a common shape space56,57.
To contextualize the degree of developmental change subsequent to second
molar occlusion, a principal component analysis was performed on mean
configurations at different developmental stages. For each species, means were
computed for specimens with (a) no permanent molars (complete deciduous
dentition), (b) M2 in occlusion but M3 unerupted and (c) complete dental
occlusion. Separate means were computed for adult males and females due to their
divergent morphology58. Principal component ordination of these mean
configurations summarizes the relevant shape differences between M2 occlusion
and adults, relative to the longer developmental sequence during permanent molar
eruption (Fig. 3a).
Developmental changes after M2 occlusion were also assessed visually by
generating hypothetical adult morphologies of MH1 using species- and sex-specific
developmental trajectories of extant African apes and humans. Developmental
vectors were computed by subtracting the M2 sample means from the adult means.
For each species � sex, these vectors represent the shape differences between the
average of the M2 configuration and the average adult configuration. Each of these
vectors was then added to the MH1 landmark configuration to generate a new set
of landmarks representing the estimated adult morphology of MH1 according to
the species � sex vector. A surface rendering of MH1 based on synchotron X-ray
tomography data59 was warped into these hypothetical configurations using thin-
plate spline interpolation computed in Landmark 3.0.0.6 (ref. 60). While all adult
configurations were examined, the hypothetical adult morphology is represented
here using the ‘morph’ computed from the Pan troglodytes developmental vector
(Fig. 3b).
Collection of strain data. FEA provides information about multiple types of
stress, strain and deformation at each element in a FEM, resulting in potentially
millions of variates (although these variates are not statistically independent from
each other). Colour maps, as in Fig. 2, provide a convenient means of summarizing
large amounts of data, allowing qualitative assessments of strain magnitude and
distribution. Quantitative data were extracted from a small number of locations on
the crania (Fig. 1) corresponding to regions from which strain data have been
collected in vivo during primate feeding experiments or that are found on

 morphological traits that are derived in australopiths26,29. Strain data from 10 of
the regions from which in vivo data exist were then used to ‘normalize’ the colour
maps in Fig. 2 so as to provide information about the spatial distribution of high
and low strain magnitudes independent of absolute strain magnitudes (strain from
the zygomatic arches were excluded from this procedure because those data vary so
extensively in vivo that they would have heavily biased the resulting relative strain
maps26).
