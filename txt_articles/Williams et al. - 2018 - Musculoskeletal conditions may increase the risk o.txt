Abstract
Background: Chronic diseases and musculoskeletal conditions have a significant global burden and frequently co-
occur. Musculoskeletal conditions may contribute to the development of chronic disease; however, this has not
been systematically synthesised. We aimed to investigate whether the most common musculoskeletal conditions,
namely neck or back pain or osteoarthritis of the knee or hip, contribute to the development of chronic disease.
Methods: We searched CINAHL, Embase, Medline, Medline in Process, PsycINFO, Scopus and Web of Science to
February 8, 2018, for cohort studies reporting adjusted estimates of the association between baseline
musculoskeletal conditions (neck or back pain or osteoarthritis of the knee or hip) and subsequent
diagnosis of a chronic disease (cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease or
obesity). Two independent reviewers performed data extraction and assessed study quality. Adjusted hazard ratios
were pooled using the generic inverse variance method in random effect models, regardless of the type of
musculoskeletal condition or chronic disease. PROSPERO: CRD42016039519.
Results: There were 13 cohort studies following 3,086,612 people. In the primary meta-analysis of adjusted
estimates, osteoarthritis (n = 8 studies) and back pain (n = 2) were the exposures and cardiovascular disease
(n = 8), cancer (n = 1) and diabetes (n = 1) were the outcomes. Pooled adjusted estimates from these 10
studies showed that people with a musculoskeletal condition have a 17% increase in the rate of developing
a chronic disease compared to people without (hazard ratio 1.17, 95% confidence interval 1.13–1.22; I2 52%,
total n = 2,686,113 people).
Conclusions: This meta-analysis found that musculoskeletal conditions may increase the risk of chronic disease. In
particular, osteoarthritis appears to increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Prevention and early
treatment of musculoskeletal conditions and targeting associated chronic disease risk factors in people with long
standing musculoskeletal conditions may play a role in preventing other chronic diseases. However, a greater
understanding about why musculoskeletal conditions may increase the risk of chronic disease is needed.

 Background
Non-communicable chronic diseases are responsible for a
significant global burden of disease. Cardiovascular disease,
cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases ranked
among the leading causes of global disability-adjusted life
years
in
2015
[1].
Together,
these
conditions
were
responsible for over 31 million of 56 million deaths world-
wide in 2012 [2]. Obesity, now also considered a chronic
disease [3], also contributes to a high rate of morbidity and
all-cause mortality [2].
Another significant source of the global disease burden
is from musculoskeletal conditions, specifically neck and
back pain as well as osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee and/
or hip [1, 4]. Neck and back pain ranks fourth among
the leading causes of disability-adjusted life years, and
elderly people with neck and back pain or OA die
sooner than those without [1, 5, 6]. When considering
only years lived with disability (YLDs), neck and back
pain, as well as OA, rank 1st and 13th, respectively,
among all causes of global YLDs and together accounted
for 13.6% of YLDs in 2015 [4].
Evidence shows that chronic diseases and musculoskeletal
conditions frequently co-occur [7] and, importantly, people
with musculoskeletal conditions are reported to have
roughly a two-fold chance of having chronic disease of other
body systems such as heart disease, neurological disorders,
gastric ulcers and endocrine disorders [8]. Several mecha-
nisms have been proposed to explain these links. Chronic
inflammation associated with OA has been hypothesised to
increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and can-
cer [6]. Pain and disability from musculoskeletal conditions
can also limit participation in physical activity, or may influ-
ence other risk factors for chronic diseases, for example,
weight gain or poor sleep [6, 8–11]. Similarly, pain manage-
ment approaches which are widely used for back pain and
OA, for example, the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs, are known to increase the risk of cardiovascular
events and mortality [6]. These hypotheses suggest musculo-
skeletal pain may play a role in the subsequent development
of other chronic diseases.
Nevertheless, despite the suggested link between mus-
culoskeletal conditions and chronic diseases [6, 9, 12,
13], to the best of our knowledge, the available studies
have not been systematically synthesised and a direct
longitudinal relationship has not been considered. To
determine if the most common and burdensome muscu-
loskeletal conditions (neck or back pain or OA of the
knee or hip) increased the development of chronic dis-
ease (cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, chronic re-
spiratory disease and obesity) we conducted a systematic
review and meta-analysis of longitudinal cohort studies
reporting adjusted estimates of the association between
these musculoskeletal conditions and the development
of chronic disease.
Methods
The systematic review protocol was prospectively regis-
tered with Prospero on May 24, 2016 (PROSPERO 2016,
CRD42016039519:
https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/
display_record.php?RecordID=39519). The systematic re-
view adheres to the Meta-analysis of Observational Stud-
ies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) reporting guideline [14].
Study eligibility
We included longitudinal cohort studies that estimated a
direct association between baseline neck or back pain or
OA of the knee or hip (i.e. exposure) and subsequent diag-
nosis of a chronic disease (cardiovascular disease, cancer,
diabetes, chronic respiratory disease or obesity) over any
follow-up length (i.e. outcome). We did not aim to identify
studies of mechanisms or specific causal factors for
chronic
disease
such
as
treatment
provided
(e.g.
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) or features of pain
(e.g. disabling pain). Studies with mixed populations of
musculoskeletal conditions where separate data was pro-
vided for the conditions of interest, or where at least 75%
of the ‘musculoskeletal conditions’ reported were one of
or a combination of neck or back pain or OA of the knee
or hip, were included. Studies assessing specific forms of
OA other than knee or hip (e.g. hand/wrist, foot, etc.)
were excluded. We included any study that assessed
‘osteoarthritis’ broadly (i.e. did not define the type of OA)
as we expected knee and hip OA would constitute the ma-
jority of participants, as these are the most prevalent
forms of OA [15]. We included all neck or back pain and
OA, defined as clinical, self-reported and diagnoses with
or without imaging. There were no restrictions on the
study setting, participant age, length of follow-up, publica-
tion type (e.g. abstracts from conference proceedings,
dissertations), publication date or language.
Data sources and search strategy
We searched CINAHL, Embase, Medline, Medline in
Process, PsycINFO, Scopus and Web of Science for eli-
gible studies. Databases were searched from inception to
February 8, 2018. The search used key terms as subject
headings and text words to identify (1) neck or back
pain or OA of the knee or hip, and (2) chronic diseases
(cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, chronic respira-
tory disease or obesity) along with terms for chronic dis-
ease and morbidity (Additional file 1: Table S1). The
search strategy was reviewed and performed by an infor-
mation specialist. We manually searched the reference
lists of included studies to identify further studies. All
references were stored in Endnote X7 software.
Study selection
Before screening, duplicates were removed using the du-
plicate removal function in Endnote X7 software. After
Williams et al. BMC Medicine  (2018) 16:167 
Page 2 of 9
 removing duplicates, pairs of review authors independ-
ently screened studies for inclusion based on title and
abstract (AW, SK, KO, SY, ER, CW). For studies not ex-
cluded at this step, each full text retrieved was screened
independently by pairs of review authors to determine
final inclusion (AW, SK, KO, CW). Consensus was used
to resolve any disagreements and a third reviewer was
consulted when required (SK, CW). Articles written in a
language other than English were screened by a re-
searcher with relevant language skills, these researchers
either worked in the same institution as one of the au-
thors or were familiar to an author via collaboration on
previous projects.
Data extraction
Relevant information was extracted from included stud-
ies by one author and checked for accuracy and omis-
sions by a second author (AW, KO). Discrepancies were
resolved by discussion. The following study characteris-
tic information was extracted into nine categories, as
outlined in Additional file 1: Table S2: study source and
country, population description, number of patients with
a musculoskeletal condition, age, sex, measure of mus-
culoskeletal
condition,
measure
of
chronic
disease,
follow-up time and adjustment for any covariates. All in-
formation was extracted directly into the table. Outcome
data (i.e. estimates of the association between a muscu-
loskeletal condition and a chronic disease) were ex-
tracted into Microsoft Excel 2013 and then those
estimates used in meta-analyses were stored in RevMan5
software for analysis [16].
Risk of bias assessment
Risk of bias was assessed using a modified version of the
Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool for assessing
studies of prognostic factors [17]. For this review, we
were interested in assessing a risk factor or exposure
that increases the likelihood of developing a disease, in
this case a musculoskeletal condition, rather than a
prognostic factor that influences the outcome from or
the course of a disease. Thus, we amended the ‘prognos-
tic factor’ domain in QUIPS to reflect this. The following
six domains were considered: study participation, study
attrition, risk factor measurement, outcome measure-
ment, study confounding, and statistical analysis and
reporting. Each domain was assessed as having high,
moderate or low risk of bias. Overall risk of bias was
also assessed for each study; the designers of the QUIPS
tool recommend that this is done by determining which
domains (of the six) are most important and assigning
low risk if a study is low in those domains [17]. In line
with this recommendation, we categorised a study as
having a ‘low risk of bias’ when the risk of bias was rated
low on at least four of the six domains, and was rated
low for both study attrition and study confounding. Two
authors independently assessed each study (AW, SK).
Consensus was used to resolve any disagreement and a
third reviewer was consulted when required (CW).
Data synthesis
We calculated pooled hazard ratios (HRs) of the effect
of the exposure (musculoskeletal condition) on the out-
come (chronic disease) and 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) using the generic inverse variance method [18].
We used random effect models to incorporate hetero-
geneity between studies [19]. Not all studies reported
HRs and 95% CI. Despite being modelled under different
assumptions, incidence rate ratios are considered ap-
proximations of HRs and, therefore, were included in
the meta-analysis [20]. Where the incidence rate and
number of events were reported, these data were used to
calculate the incidence rate ratio and standard error, re-
spectively. Where the number of events was not re-
ported, we attempted to contact authors for further data.
Where authors did not respond to contact attempts, we
estimated the standard error using the number of events
derived from available data. The number of events was
calculated using the number of patient years per group
and the incidence rate per group. The patient years per
group was calculated using the total number of people
in each group (those with the musculoskeletal condition
and those without), and the mean years of follow-up.
In the primary meta-analysis, we pooled estimates
from all musculoskeletal conditions and chronic dis-
eases. We pooled estimates using the most adjusted esti-
mates
from
each
study.
Where
possible,
we
also
reported pooled estimates by musculoskeletal condition
and by chronic disease. We undertook a secondary ana-
lysis using unadjusted estimates from each study.
Where there was more than one article reporting on
the same patient sample, we included the data that was
most clinically homogenous with the other included
studies or included the more comprehensive exposure
or outcome (i.e. all cancer rather than a specific cancer).
If several estimates were reported from one study (e.g.
men and women), where possible, we combined esti-
mates using a fixed effects model to generate one esti-
mate for the sample. When combining several estimates
from within a study was not appropriate (i.e. where the
unexposed group would be counted twice), we chose a
single estimate based on clinical homogeneity with other
studies in the meta-analysis, the less selective sample or
interpretability of the clinical measures.
We used sensitivity analyses to test whether the pri-
mary adjusted meta-analysis was affected by overall risk
of bias. This involved performing a meta-analysis includ-
ing only studies at low risk of bias determined by the
QUIPS tool, and comparing the pooled estimate with
Williams et al. BMC Medicine  (2018) 16:167 
Page 3 of 9
 the primary analysis. We also used sensitivity analyses to
assess whether the primary adjusted meta-analysis was
affected by our decisions to choose between different ex-
posures or outcomes reported within the one study. This
involved performing meta-analyses whereby the alterna-
tive reported estimate was substituted in for our original
choice, and the pooled estimates with the primary ana-
lysis were compared.
The
impact
of
heterogeneity
between
studies
was
assessed using the I2 statistic with ≥ 50% considered sub-
stantial. Funnel plots to identify small-study effects were
planned for analyses including at least 10 estimates [21]. All
analyses were conducted using RevMan5 software [16].
Results
Study selection
The search identified 15,824 articles, of which 12,447
remained after removal of duplicates. There were 236 arti-
cles that remained after title and abstract screening; of
these, 205 were excluded after assessment of the full text
Additional file 2. Eleven abstracts were excluded as the full
text or sufficient data were not available, confirmed by
correspondence with authors or no response to contact at-
tempts. Two abstracts with sufficient data and information
to assess inclusion were included in the review. This left
20 articles [9, 12, 13, 22–38] that met the criteria for in-
clusion. The 20 articles reported on 13 studies, and there
was sufficient data reported from 11 studies to be included
in meta-analyses (Fig. 1).
Study characteristics
The 13 studies included data from a total of 3,086,612
persons (mean follow-up 4–16 years) [9, 12, 13, 22, 24–
26, 29, 31, 35–38]. Of those studies that reported a mean
participant age, seven reported a mean of > 50 years [12,
13, 22, 24, 29, 31, 38], and three studies reported a mean
of > 70 years [9, 35, 37]. Four studies were from Canada
[13, 31, 35, 36], two from the United Kingdom [29, 38]
and one each from the United States of America [25],
Taiwan [22], the Netherlands [12], Italy [37], Spain [24],
Australia
[9]
and
Norway
[26].
All
studies
were
published in English. The musculoskeletal condition (ex-
posure) was general OA in seven studies [13, 22, 25,
35–38], knee OA in three studies [12, 31, 37], hip OA in

 three studies [12, 31, 37], back pain in four studies
[9, 24, 26, 29] and neck pain in one study [29]. The
chronic disease (outcome) was cardiovascular disease
in nine studies [9, 12, 13, 22, 25, 35–38], cancer in
one study [29], diabetes in three studies [24, 31, 33]
and obesity in one study [26]. All studies excluded
participants who reported the outcome of interest at
baseline. Descriptive data for all studies is provided in
Additional file 1: Table S2.
Risk of chronic disease from musculoskeletal conditions
The 11 studies with sufficient data for meta-analysis re-
ported 10 adjusted estimates from a total of 2,686,113
persons [9, 12, 13, 22, 25, 29, 31, 36–38] and five un-
adjusted estimates from a total of 612,873 persons [13,
22, 25, 35, 37]. The primary meta-analysis of adjusted
estimates (Fig. 2) showed a statistically significant in-
creased risk of chronic disease incidence from musculo-
skeletal conditions (HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.13–1.22, I2 52%,
10 studies). Studies most often adjusted for age, sex,
body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipid-
aemia and smoking. A full list of adjustment variables
per study are outlined in Additional file 1: Table S2. The
unadjusted meta-analysis demonstrated a larger, statisti-
cally significant association (HR 1.39, 95% CI 1.23–1.58,
I2 94%, five studies).
Analyses by condition
Combining all studies with adjusted estimates that
assessed OA as the exposure revealed a statistically sig-
nificant increased risk of chronic disease (HR 1.16, 95%
CI 1.14–1.18, I2 0%, eight studies). Seven of the eight
studies that included OA as the exposure assessed the
increased risk of cardiovascular disease [12, 13, 22, 25,
36–38]. Removal of the remaining study that assessed
the increased risk of diabetes [31] did not change the re-
sults (Fig. 2). Combining the two studies with adjusted
estimates that assessed OA as the exposure and diabetes
as the outcome revealed a statistically significant in-
creased risk of diabetes (HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.11–1.22, I2
0%, two studies) [31, 33]. We were unable to perform
analysis by back or neck pain due to the limited number
of included studies of these conditions. Two individual
studies of back pain found that those with back pain had
an increased risk of cardiovascular disease [9] (HR 2.13,
95% CI 1.32–3.44) and cancer [29] (HR 1.25, 95% CI
1.19–1.32) compared to people without. The one study
that assessed neck pain found that those with neck pain
had an increased risk of cancer [29] (HR 1.20, 95% CI
1.09–1.31), compared to people without.
Combining all musculoskeletal conditions as the
exposure and cardiovascular disease as the outcome
revealed a statistically significant increased risk of car-
diovascular disease (HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.12–1.19, I2
31%, eight studies) (Fig. 3). We were unable to per-
form
analyses
by
other
chronic
disease
(cancer,
chronic respiratory disease, diabetes or obesity) due
to the insufficient number of included studies of these
conditions.
Risk of bias assessment
Of the 13 included studies, 10% (n = 8) of the six do-
mains showed a high risk of bias, 23% (n = 18) showed
moderate risk, and 67% (n = 52) low risk. Risk of bias
was highest in the ‘study confounding’ domain, with
three studies at high risk [29, 35, 38] and four at moder-
ate risk [9, 13, 24, 25]. Of the 10 studies included in the
primary meta-analysis of adjusted estimates, three had
an overall low risk of bias [12, 22, 31].

 Sensitivity analyses
Sensitivity analysis including the three low risk of bias
studies demonstrated a statistically significant associ-
ation between musculoskeletal conditions and chronic
disease (HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.09–1.21, I2 0%). These stud-
ies all assessed OA, two assessed cardiovascular disease
[12, 22] and one diabetes [31].
We conducted sensitivity analyses of the primary ad-
justed meta-analysis, whereby we substituted in an alter-
native exposure (i.e. general OA vs. hip OA only vs.
knee OA only) or outcome (i.e. cardiovascular disease
vs. diabetes), from five studies [12, 13, 29, 31, 37] where
multiple exposures or outcomes were reported. In all
cases, using the alternative estimate did not alter the
pooled HR by more than 0.2 and all estimates remained
significant.
Substantial heterogeneity (I2 52%) was present in the
primary meta-analysis of adjusted estimates. Sensitivity
analysis exploring this found that, when the two studies
of back pain were removed and only studies of OA
remained and heterogeneity dropped to 0%.
Inspection of the funnel plot for the primary adjusted
meta-analysis showed that the plot was symmetrical
aside from one small-study outlier. Removal of the out-
lier [9] did not change the pooled estimate (Fig. 4).
Discussion
This systematic review and meta-analysis, including data
from 2,686,113 persons, showed that people with a mus-
culoskeletal condition have a 17% increase in the risk of
developing a chronic disease compared to people with-
out such a condition. Most studies included OA as the
exposure and cardiovascular disease as the outcome;
analysis of these studies revealed that people who re-
ported OA have a 16% increase in the risk of developing
cardiovascular disease, compared to people without.
Two individual studies concerning back pain and one of
neck pain reported that those with back pain had an in-
creased risk of cardiovascular disease and those with
back or neck pain had an increased the risk of cancer.
While our review question ultimately sought to assess a
causal connection between common musculoskeletal
conditions and chronic disease, we cannot draw strong
conclusions
due
to
poor
adjustment,
the
analysis
methods employed by the included studies, and a lack of
studies investigating conditions other than OA and car-
diovascular disease.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt
at a meta-analysis of longitudinal cohort studies that es-
timates the risk of developing a chronic disease in
people with highly prevalent and burdensome musculo-
skeletal conditions, neck or back pain, or OA of the knee
or hip. This review was prospectively registered with the
international prospective register of systematic reviews
(PROSPERO) and has been reported following the
MOOSE reporting guidelines. We used a comprehensive
search strategy, studies were not limited by publication
date or language, and we assessed risk of bias using a
specific tool for observational studies. We reported ana-
lyses by condition, and conducted sensitivity analyses of
studies that had low risk of bias and for studies that re-
ported multiple exposures or outcomes, all of which

 provided precise estimates, very similar to that of the
primary analysis.
The lack of sufficient low risk of bias studies to confi-
dently test the full hypothesis represents a major limita-
tion in the strength of the conclusions regarding the
general hypothesis about musculoskeletal conditions.
While there is more confidence that OA increases the
risk of cardiovascular disease, the lack of studies asses-
sing other conditions limits the generalisability of our re-
sults. Due to the small number of included studies we
were unable to assess the effect of various study charac-
teristics (e.g. age, sex, variation in the measurement of
the exposure and outcome, etc.) on the observed esti-
mates. Further, none of the studies in the review
assessed latent exposure to musculoskeletal conditions.
It is possible that participants who reported no musculo-
skeletal condition at baseline (i.e. unexposed), developed
a musculoskeletal condition during follow-up (i.e. be-
came exposed), but we could not assess this from the in-
cluded studies. Furthermore, it is not clear if adjusting
for this exposure would attenuate or amplify our esti-
mate. Finally, while our assessment of funnel plots sug-
gested that there was no evidence of small-study effects,
we do not know the influence of the 11 studies for
which a full text was not available.
Our intention was to synthesise studies that used
methods enabling an assessment of causal effects. To do
this, we restricted inclusion to longitudinal cohort stud-
ies to assess temporal relationships, and prioritised ad-
justed estimates over crude estimates to account for
potential confounding. We did not find studies that sat-
isfied all of Bradford Hill’s suggested criteria for casual
inference (e.g. none estimated dose–response effects)
nor did we find studies that used contemporary causal
inference methods for observational data (e.g. a struc-
tured identification approach for selection of confound-
ing variables [39, 40] or assessment of the effects of
unmeasured or residual confounders [41–43]). As such,
we are unable to infer a strong causal connection be-
tween musculoskeletal conditions and chronic diseases.
There is evidence to suggest that the relationships
found in this review are biologically plausible, meaning
that there are possible mechanisms by which musculo-
skeletal conditions may contribute to the development
of chronic disease. For example, there is evidence to sug-
gest that chronic inflammation from OA may increase
the risk of cardiovascular disease [6]. Further, pain and
disability from these conditions can often limit participa-
tion in physical activity and lead to higher weight gain,
both of which are recognised risk factors for cardiovas-
cular disease and cancer [6, 8, 9]. However, none of the
included studies assessed possible causal mechanisms.
While we did not intend to study mechanisms of the
effect, our review provides useful evidence for one
direction of accumulation of multimorbidity in people
with chronic disease.
Our review focused on the most common and burden-
some musculoskeletal conditions [1, 4], showing that they
may play a role in the development of chronic disease.
Most of the evidence to date focuses on OA. Given the
high burden of back and neck pain, further research is re-
quired to examine the causal effects of these conditions on
chronic diseases. Since it is impractical and unethical to
randomise individuals to disease states (i.e. musculoskel-
etal conditions) better use of observational data is
required. To facilitate assessment of causal effects, con-
temporary analysis methods that more accurately identify
and account for confounders should be considered along-
side observational data. These might include structural
identification of confounders with directed acyclic graphs,
matching on propensity scores, or the application of in-
strumental variable analysis to eliminate the effects of re-
sidual confounders [44]. In the context of policy and
clinical practice, our findings suggest that considering
musculoskeletal conditions in the prevention of chronic
disease may be important. However, to inform this, it
would be useful to formally identify the mechanisms by
which musculoskeletal conditions could cause chronic dis-
ease. Understanding how musculoskeletal conditions inter-
act with other co-existing risk factors could further inform
targeted intervention strategies to reduce chronic diseases.
Certainly, future trials that assess the feasibility and effi-
cacy of targeting musculoskeletal conditions in chronic
disease preventive strategies are warranted.
Conclusions
This review found that musculoskeletal conditions may
increase the risk of subsequent chronic disease. In par-
ticular, meta-analysis of over 2 million people shows that
OA increases the risk of developing cardiovascular dis-
ease. The results suggest that prevention and early ef-
fective treatment of musculoskeletal conditions, such as
OA and back and neck pain, may play a role in prevent-
ing other chronic diseases. Typical targets for chronic
disease prevention currently include lifestyle risk factors
such as poor diet, physical inactivity, alcohol consump-
tion and smoking [45], but musculoskeletal conditions
are currently largely ignored. Considering their high glo-
bal burden, addressing musculoskeletal conditions via
public health strategies may have an impact on other
chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease.
