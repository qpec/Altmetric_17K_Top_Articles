in England: a national follow-back and follow-forward 
record-linkage study
Perviz Asaria, Paul Elliott, Margaret Douglass, Ziad Obermeyer, Michael Soljak, Azeem Majeed, Majid Ezzati
Summary
Background Little information is available on how primary and comorbid acute myocardial infarction contribute to the 
mortality burden of acute myocardial infarction, the share of these deaths that occur during or after a hospital admission, 
and the reasons for hospital admission of those who died from acute myocardial infarction. Our aim was to fill in these 
gaps in the knowledge about deaths and hospital admissions due to acute myocardial infarction.
Methods We used individually linked national hospital admission and mortality data for England from 2006 to 2010 to 
identify all primary and comorbid diagnoses of acute myocardial infarction during hospital stay and their associated 
fatality rates (during or within 28 days of being in hospital). Data were obtained from the UK Small Area Health 
Statistics Unit and supplied by the Health and Social Care Information Centre (now NHS Digital) and the Office of 
National Statistics. We calculated event rates (reported as per 100 000 population for relevant age and sex groups) and 
case-fatality rate for primary acute myocardial infarction diagnosed during the first physician encounter or during 
subsequent encounters, and acute myocardial infarction diagnosed only as a comorbidity. We also calculated what 
proportion of deaths from acute myocardial infarction occurred in people who had been in hospital on or within the 
28 days preceding death, and whether acute myocardial infarction was one of the recorded diagnoses in such admissions.
Findings Acute myocardial infarction was diagnosed in the first physician encounter in 307 496 (69%) of 446 744 admissions 
with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, in the second or later physician encounter in 52 374 (12%) admissions, 
and recorded only as a comorbidity in 86 874 (19%) admissions. Patients with comorbid diagnoses of acute myocardial 
infarction had two to three times the case-fatality rate of patients in whom acute myocardial infarction was a primary 
diagnosis. 135 950 deaths were recorded as being caused by acute myocardial infarction as the underlying cause of death, 
of which 66 490 (49%) occurred in patients who were in hospital on the day of death or in the 28 days preceding death. 
AMI was the primary diagnosis in 32 695 (49%) of these 66 490 patients (27 678 [42%] diagnosed in the first physician 
encounter and 5017 [8%] in a second or subsequent encounter), was a comorbid diagnosis in 12 118 (18%), and was not 
mentioned at all in the remaining 21 677 (33%). The most common causes of admission in people who did not have an 
acute myocardial infarction diagnosis but went on to die of acute myocardial infarction as the underlying cause of death 
were other circulatory conditions (7566 [35%] of 21 677 deaths), symptomatic diagnoses including non-specific chest 
pain, dyspnoea and syncope (1368 [6%] deaths), and respiratory disorders (2662 [12%] deaths), mainly pneumonia and 
chronic obstructive airways disease. 
Interpretation As many acute myocardial infarction deaths occurring within 28 days of being in hospital follow a non-
acute myocardial infarction admission as follow an acute myocardial infarction admission. These people are often 
diagnosed with other circulatory disorders or symptoms of circulatory disturbance. Further investigation is needed to 
establish whether there are symptoms and information that can be used to predict the risk of a fatal acute myocardial 
infarction in such patients, which can contribute to reducing the mortality burden of acute myocardial infarction.

Introduction
Acute myocardial infarction is a leading cause of hospital 
admissions and mortality in the UK and around the world.1 
Multimorbidity is common in patients with a primary 
diagnosis of acute myocardial in 
farction and affects both 
treatment and prognosis.2 Furthermore, acute myocardial 
infarction itself might occur as comorbidity or subsequent 
to admission for other disorders such as pneumonia, renal 
failure, or hip fracture.
Rapid diagnosis, treatment, and early revascularisation 
can substantially improve the survival of patients with 
acute myocardial infarction.3–5 Evidence is also emerging 
that patients with acute myocardial infarction events that 
occur during hospital admissions for other disorders 
might receive less streamlined care and have worse 
mortality outcomes6,7 than do those admitted with a 
primary diagnoses of acute myocardial infarction. There 
is, however, little information available on how long after

admission acute myocardial infarction events are 
diagnosed,8 how many are only comorbidities to other 
primary diagnosis, and how case fatality varies based on 
whether acute myocardial infarction is a primary or 
comorbid diagnosis and when it is diagnosed. 
Information is also scarce on how much of the mortality 
burden of acute myocardial infarction is among these 
different types of patients admitted to hospital versus 
those with no admission. We aimed to address these 
knowledge gaps using a follow-back and follow-forward 
national data linkage study of hospital admissions and 
mortality data.
English (as well as other UK) hospital admission data 
cover almost the entire population and are uniquely 
detailed because they sequentially record all physician 
encounters during the hospital admission, which 
allows the time between initial admission and diagnosis 
of acute myocardial infarction to be detected. Multiple 
disorders can be coded in each physician encounter, in 
which acute myocardial infarction might be the primary 
disorder or a comorbidity of another, possibly more 
serious or urgent, diagnosis. This level of detail 
contrasts with the single discharge diagnosis reported 
in hospital data in most countries, in which data about 
timing of diagnosis and comorbid disorders are lost. 
We used the richness of the dataset to investigate the 
clinical outcomes of patients who receive an early 
diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction as the primary 
cause of admission during the first physician encounter, 
compared with patients with a diagnosis in the second 
or subsequent physician encounter, or with a solely 
comorbid diagnosis. We also assessed what proportion 
of deaths due to acute myocardial infarction occurred 
in people who were in hospital on the day of death or 
during the previous 28 days, and the diagnoses recorded 
in such patients.
Methods
Data sources
We used national data on hospital admissions and 
mortality in England linked at the individual level. We 
obtained data for hospital episode statistics from the UK 
Small Area Health Statistics Unit (SAHSU), supplied by 
the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC; 
now NHS Digital). Hospital episode statistics data 
provide information on all admissions to the UK National 
Health Service (NHS), a publicly funded health-care 
system that serves all residents of the country.
The basic unit of data in hospital episode statistics 
from England is the finished consultant episode. A new 
finished consultant episode is recorded every time a 
patient moves from the care of one physician to another, 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched the Ovid Medline database (1946 to Feb 15, 2014) 
using the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms “acute 
coronary syndrome” or “coronary artery disease” or 
“myocardial infarction” and “mortality” or “cause of death” or 
“hospital mortality” or “survival rate” or “incidence” or 
“registries” or “medical record linkage/medical record systems, 
computerised/electronic health records”, with no language 
restrictions. We also identified reports to the UK Government, 
publications from the Department of Health and the Office for 
National Statistics, and grey literature, using searches on 
Google Scholar or through citations in peer-reviewed 
publications. We identified three types of studies. Record 
linkage studies in various high-income countries, including 
Denmark, England, New Zealand, Scotland, and Sweden, have 
quantified acute myocardial infarction event and death rates 
for entire countries. Some of these studies have also analysed 
the role of comorbidity; to our knowledge, these studies have 
not analysed the role of whether acute myocardial infarction 
was diagnosed immediately after admission or later. We did 
not find a population-based study that had quantified the 
share of deaths due to acute myocardial infarction that were 
preceded by a recent hospital encounter with no mention of 
acute myocardial infarction. Second, we found studies based 
on acute myocardial infarction registries, which typically do 
not include out-of-hospital deaths due to acute myocardial 
infarction or deaths due to acute myocardial infarction in 
people admitted with disorders other than acute myocardial 
infarction. Finally, community-based surveillance studies have 
used a combination of death registries, hospital records, 
and review of medical records to estimate acute myocardial 
infarction event rates and its clinical outcomes in specific 
subnational populations.
Added value of this study
We report case-fatality rates for comprehensive categories of 
patients in whom a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction 
was recorded at any point during their stay. To our knowledge, 
our study is the first to report the share of deaths from acute 
myocardial infarction preceded by recent or current hospital 
admission with no mention of acute myocardial infarction.
Implications of all the available evidence
In most high-income countries, about half of deaths due to 
acute myocardial infarction occur without a recent hospital 
admission. Of the deaths preceded by a recent or current 
admission, acute myocardial infarction is not mentioned as a 
diagnosis in about a third of them. Case-fatality rate was 
significantly higher in patients with acute myocardial 
infarction recorded only as a comorbidity than in those for 
whom acute myocardial infarction was a primary diagnosis. 
Improvements in the care of people admitted with an acute 
myocardial infarction, especially as a primary diagnosis, will 
only be able to affect about a third of deaths.

irrespective of whether the move is within the same 
hospital or involves transfer to another hospital. For 
example, a patient admitted under the care of an acute 
physician and then transferred to the care of a 
cardiologist will have two finished consultant episodes. 
If the patient is then sent to a tertiary hospital for 
angiography, a third finished consultant episode will be 
recorded along with a new admission. For each finished 
consultant episode, a primary diagnosis for the physician 
encounter is recorded with use of the International 
Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD10) codes 
(ICD10 code 1), as well as up to 19 secondary diagnoses 
(ICD10 code 2–20; appendix p 3). If the same attending 
physician makes a new diagnosis, this either replaces 
the physician’s existing primary diagnosis or is added as 
a comorbid diagnosis in the same finished consultant 
episode.
We used a standard grouping algorithm9–11 to collapse 
finished consultant episodes into continuous spells of 
care, such that each admitted person was counted only 
once irrespective of how many times they were 
transferred between physicians and hospitals (appendix 
p 3). The duration of an acute myocardial infarction 
event is defined as 28 days in ICD10. Thus, if two acute 
myocardial infarction admissions for the same 
individual occurred within 28 days of each other, these 
admissions were counted as part of the same acute 
episode and the timing for the most recent admission 
was used to calculate case-fatality rate. We used the 
timing for the most recent admission to avoid 
associating two fatal events with a single patient. We 
use the term hospital admission to refer to a continuous 
spell of care. Hospital episode statistics data are coded 
in accordance with national coding rules, with codes 
based on ICD 10.12 On the basis of results from previous 
validation studies,13,14 we used the ICD10 codes I21 and 
I22 to identify acute myocardial infarction events.
We also used mortality data from SAHSU, supplied by 
the Office for National Statistics (ONS). These data include 
all deaths in England. We used the underlying cause for 
each death record and identified deaths attributed to acute 
myocardial infarction using the same ICD codes as for 
acute myocardial infarction diagnoses. England has one of 
the most rigorous and systematic vital registration systems 
worldwide, with clear algorithms to assign underlying 
cause of death from the multiple causes mentioned on the 
death certificate. Estimates suggest that only 10–15% of 
assigned underlying causes in data from England are not 
true pathophysiological causes of death.15 In particular, 
organ failure is rarely used as an underlying cause of 
death in mortality statistics from England (0·4% of all 
deaths in 2010).
The final dataset consisted of all hospital admissions 
with acute myocardial infarction and all deaths from 
acute myocardial infarction from 2006 to 2010 in people 
aged 35 years and older (figure 1). Record linkage 
between hospital admission and deaths was provided by 
the HSCIC and included deaths registered up to 
March 31, 2012. In England, late registration of death 
can occur if there is an inquest into the cause of death. 
Out-of-hospital deaths due to acute myocardial 
infarction were classified as those without any hospital 
admissions in the preceding 28 days. Not only is 28 days 
consistent with the definition of acute myocardial 
infarction used in the ICD, it is also the duration used 
to define an acute event in the WHO Multinational 
MONItoring

trends 
and 
determinants

Data use was approved by the National Research 
Ethics Service (reference 12/LO/0566 and 12/LO/0567) 
and the Health Research Authority Confidentially 
Advisory Group (HRA-CAG) for Section 251 support 
(HRA-14/CAG/1039).
Statistical analysis
We assessed the proportion of deaths due to acute 
myocardial infarction that occurred in people who were 
in a hospital in the previous 28 days, including on the day 
of death, and whether acute myocardial infarction was 
one of the recorded diagnoses in such patients. For those 
deaths without an acute myocardial infarction diagnosis, 
we assessed the diagnoses recorded in the final physician 
encounter.
We also calculated event rates per 100 000 population 
and case-fatality rate by age group and sex for primary 
acute myocardial infarction diagnosed during the first 
physician encounter, primary acute myocardial infarction 
diagnosed during subsequent encounters, and acute 
myocardial infarction diagnosed only as a comorbidity. 
We calculated the rates of hospital admissions for 
primary and comorbid acute myocardial infarction using 
mid-year age-sex-specific population estimates provided 
by the ONS. We calculated case-fatality rate as the 
proportion of admissions in each group that resulted in 
death within 28 days. We estimated 95% CIs with the 
assumption that the observed number of events or deaths 
followed a Poisson distribution.
In a sensitivity analysis, we excluded those aged 
85 years and older from the sample to investigate 
whether our findings were largely driven by deaths in 
the very elderly. We also examined the effects of 
restricting admissions to those marked as emergency 
and to those with duration greater than 1 day because 
suggestions have previously been made that short and 
non-emergency admissions might include patients who 
are investigated for acute myocardial infarction but do 
not actually have it.16–18
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of

Results
Acute myocardial infarction was recorded as the 
underlying cause of 135 950 deaths during the analysis 
(figure 1, table). Of the people who died from acute 
myocardial infarction, 69 460 (51%) died without a hospital 
admission in the preceding 28 days and 66 490 (49%) died 
within 28 days of having been in hospital (figure 2). 
59 187 (89%) of the deaths within 28 days of having been 
in a hospital occurred while the patient was still in the 
hospital. The hospital records for the 66 490 patients who 
were in hospital in the 28 days before death from acute 
myocardial infarction showed that acute myocardial 
infarction was the primary diagnosis in 32 695 (49%) of 
these deaths (27 678 diagnosed in the first physician 
encounter and 5017 in a second or subsequent encounter), 
a comorbid diagnosis in 12 118 (18%), and not mentioned 
at all in the remaining 21 677 (33%). 16 530 (76%) of the 
21 677 patients without a mention of acute myocardial 
infarction in their previous records were still in hospital at 
the time of death. The most common diagnoses in people

Figure 1: Schematic of hospital admissions and deaths
Data only include people aged 35 years and older. Deaths and admissions were from Jan 1, 2006, to Dec 31, 2010. Admissions linked to death from acute myocardial infarction within this period might 
have occurred up to 28 days before the start of this period and were included. Deaths linked to admissions within this period might have occurred up to 28 days after the end of the period and were 
included. We used a continuous inpatient spell algorithm to collapse finished consultant episodes into admissions and then collapsed them further so that admissions within 28 days of the index event 
were counted as part of the same event. A breakdown of the numbers in each category is available in the appendix (p 2).

without a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction who 
went on to have acute myocardial infarction as the 
underlying cause of death were other circulatory disorders 
(7566 [35%] of 21 667 patients), including heart failure and 
atrial fibrillation; symptomatic diagnoses (6434 [30%] 
patients), 1368 of which were non-specific chest pain, 
dyspnoea, syncope, and haemodynamic disturbance or 
abnormal heart sounds; respiratory disorders (2662 [12%] 
patients), mostly consisting of pneumonia and chronic 
obstructive airways disease; and injuries (1912 [9%] 
patients), especially hip fractures (figure 3).
855 523 (1%) of 60 504 226 hospital episode statistics 
records mentioned acute myocardial infarction as either a 
primary or comorbid diagnosis (figure 1). After accounting 
for transfer between physicians and pro 
viders, we collapsed 
these records into 446 744 continuous spells of care in 
which acute myocardial infarction was recorded as a 
primary or comorbid diagnosis. The patient died in 
75 901 (17%) of these admissions. In 359 870 (81%) of 
446 744 acute myocardial infarction admissions, the 
primary diagnosis was acute myocardial infarction. 
Of these 359 870 patients with primary diagnoses of acute 
myocardial infarction, the diagnosis was made at the first 
physician encounter for 307 496 (85%) patients (69% of all 
446 744 admissions for acute myocardial infarction) and in 
the second or subsequent encounter for the other 
52 375 (15%) patients (12% of all 446 744 admissions for 
acute 
myocardial 
infarction). 
Diagnoses 
of 
acute 
myocardial infarction that were made in the second or 
subsequent physician encounter were more common in 
elderly people than in young and middle-aged people, and 
represented a greater proportion of all acute myocardial 
infarction diagnoses in women than in men (table). 
Comorbid diagnoses of acute myocardial infarction 
represented 86 874 (19%) of 446 744 hospital ad-
missions for acute myocardial infarction (47 705 [18%] 
of 271 150 admissions of men and 39 169 [22%] of 
175 594 admissions of women). The most frequent primary 
causes for admission in these patients were atherosclerotic 
heart disease, hip fracture, pneumonia, chronic obstructive 
airways disease, heart failure, and stroke (figure 3). Overall, 
the primary causes in 37 234 (43%) of these admissions 
were other circulatory conditions and in the remaining 
49 640 (57%) admissions they were non-circulatory causes. 
23 730 (26%) of 90 881 admissions for acute myocardial 
infarction in patients aged 85 years or older were comorbid 
diagnoses, compared with 1651 (12%) of 14 208 admissions 
in patients aged 35−44 years. 
Admission and case-fatality rates for hospitalised 
patients are shown in figure 4. The 28 day case-fatality

physician encounter ranged from 19 deaths per 
1000 events in 35−44 year olds to 272 deaths per 
1000 events in patients aged 85 years and older (figure 4). 
Case-fatality rates were slightly higher in patients with a 
primary diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction made in 
the second or subsequent physician encounter than in 
those with a diagnosis made at the first encounter 
(figure 4).8 By contrast, case-fatality rates were 
substantially higher in patients with acute myo 
cardial 
infarction recorded only as a comorbidity than in patients 
with primary acute myocardial infarction diagnosis made 
in the first physician encounter, ranging from 63 deaths 
per 1000 events in patients aged 35−44 years to 437 deaths 
per 1000 events in those aged 85 years or older. In people 
younger than 65 years, case-fatality rates were higher in 
women than in men, especially for comorbid acute 
myocardial infarction (appendix p 1). Case-fatality rates 
for the men and women equalised as age increased.
11 265 (23%) of 48 420 deaths within 28 days of being in 
hospital for acute myocardial infarction were certified to 
causes other than acute myocardial infarction, frequently 
chronic ischaemic heart diseases, other circu 
latory 
conditions, atherosclerotic heart disease, respir 
atory 
disorders, and cancer, whereas acute myocardial infarction 
was a contributing cause in 4460 (9%) of 48 420 deaths 
(figure 3).
The crude acute myocardial infarction event rate in 
people aged 35 years or older with a primary diagnosis of 
acute myocardial infarction in the first physician 
encounter, including fatal and non-fatal acute myocardial 
infarction admissions and out-of-hospital deaths from 
acute myocardial infarction, was 288 cases (95% CI 
287−289) per 100 000 people; the crude case-fatality rate 
was 356 deaths (354−358) per 1000 events. Figure 5 
shows the effects of including diagnoses of acute 
myocardial infarction made in second or subsequent 
physician encounters and comorbid diagnoses on the 
national estimates of acute myocardial infarction event 
rate, case-fatality rate, hospitalised case fatality rate, and 
proportion of out-of-hospital deaths.
Our sensitivity analysis excluding patients aged 
85 years and older resulted in a higher proportion of 
acute myocardial infarction deaths not preceded by any 
admission (51 291 [55%] of 93 012 deaths) than in 
our main analyses (69 460 [51%] of 135 950 deaths). 
However, the proportion of deaths occurring after an 
admission for a cause other than acute myocardial 
infarction admission or after a comorbid acute 
myocardial infarction admission (21 575 [23%] of 
93 012 deaths) remained roughly equal to the proportion 
occurring after an admission for acute myocardial 
infarction (20 146 [22%] of 93 012 deaths; appendix p 4).
In our sensitivity analysis excluding short stay (less 
than 1 day) admissions, the admission rate for acute 
myocardial infarction diagnosed as a primary disorder 
was 242 cases per 100 000 people, which was 3% lower 
than in our main analysis (249 cases per 100 000 people). 
When we excluded non-emergency admissions, the 
admission rate was 236 cases per 100 000 people, which 
was a 5% reduction. These sensitivity analyses had little 
effect on case-fatality rates (data not shown). It is now 
feasible to rapidly diagnose, treat, and safely discharge a 
low-risk patient who has had a true acute event, within 
24−48 h,19–21 and as such, exclusion of short-stay and non-
emergency patients could lead an underestimation of 
acute myocardial infarction event rates.
Discussion
The results of our national data-linkage study show the 
clinical trajectory of the different presentations of acute 
myocardial infarction in England. 49% of all people 
with fatal acute myocardial infarction were in hospital 
at the time of their death or in the 28 days preceding it 
and the other 51% of people who died of acute 
myocardial infarction deaths did not have a recent 
admission. Acute myocardial infarction was not 
mentioned as a diagnosis in 33% of deaths with a 
recent admission (ie, 16% of all acute myocardial 
infarction deaths). In about 12% of all patients admitted 
to hospital with acute myocardial infarction, acute 
myocardial infarction was diagnosed in the second or 
later physician encounter; it was recorded only as a 
comorbidity in a further 19%.
Our results are based on a large dataset that covers 
almost the entire population of England, where 
admissions to private hospitals represent only a very 
small proportion of total admissions, especially for acute 
disorders 
such 
as 
acute 
myocardial 
infarction. 
Population-based record linkage can simultaneously 
capture non-fatal acute myocardial infarctions, and both 
in and out of hospital fatal ones, allowing the clinical 
trajectory of the disorder to be fully followed up. Studies 
in a few countries where record linkage is feasible have 
produced estimates of acute myocardial infarction event 
rates, case-fatality rates, and proportion of out-of-hospital

deaths,17,22–27 as well as other measures of quality of 
care.21,28,29 Our data have the additional advantage of 
allowing us to analyse the role of acute myocardial 
infarction that is diagnosed in the second or later 
physician encounter or only as a comorbidity, which have 
been excluded from previous analyses in England.
The use of routine data, although necessary for national 
surveillance, also leads to some limitations. Clinical criteria 
defined for the case-ascertainment of acute myocardial 
infarction in cohort studies do not translate well to routine 
ICD10 codes. Furthermore, ICD codes provide a 
standardised summary of a diagnosis but do not specify 
the underlying investigations and laboratory results—eg, 
ST elevation acute myocardial infarction cannot be 
distinguished from non-ST elevation acute myocardial 
infarction in ICD coding. We were thus unable to verify 
acute myocardial infarction events with electrocardiogram 
and laboratory findings, and we were reliant on the routine

The top section shows underlying causes of death for patients with a primary acute myocardial infarction diagnosis recorded during the first physician encounter and during subsequent encounters 
who died within 28 days. The proportion of patients with a primary acute myocardial infraction diagnosis who remained alive are not shown here, as their number is large, but are given in the table 
and the appendix (p 2). The bottom section shows primary diagnoses for patients with acute myocardial infarction diagnosed as a comorbidity and for patients admitted with a cause other than acute 
myocardial infarction admission who died from acute myocardial infarction within 28 days. Grey bands are proportionate to the number of patients in each category. The vertical bars on the far left 
show the specific primary hospital diagnoses, and those on the far right show the specific causes of death for people whose primary diagnosis or cause of death was not acute myocardial infarction.

coding of hospital episode statistics and mortality data. 
The quality of hospital data varies by disorder, with 
common diagnoses such as acute myocardial infarction 
being better coded than rarer ones.30,31 Results from linkage 
studies in Scotland and Wales, which used data similar to 
ours, show high accuracy for the diagnosis of acute 
myocardial infarction.32,33 Furthermore, in two systematic 
reviews that examined studies comparing disease registers 
to routinely coded acute myocardial infarction, sensitivity 
and positive predictive values were 79−95%, with hospital 
data seeming to have better validity than death records.13,14 
For deaths, it is possible that certifying doctors use acute 
myocardial infarction as a convenient catch-all terminal 
cause when they have insufficient information about the 
deceased’s recent medical history. Evidence suggests that 
acute myocardial infarction might be over-assigned as a 
cause of death in some subgroups and under-assigned in 
others.14,34 Guided by our results on subgroups with 
admissions for causes other than acute myocardial 
infarction preceding death from acute myocardial 
infarction, in-depth studies are needed to verify whether 
these admissions represent missed opportunities for the 
diagnosis and treatment of acute myocardial infarction 
versus misclassification of cause of death. Recorded cases 
aside, some studies have estimated that routinely collected 
hospital and mortality data might underestimate the 
overall incidence of acute myocardial infarction by 
10−23%.35,36 Finally, linkage itself is an imperfect process 
and record linkage in England fails to match 2·3% of 
deaths to their preceding admission.37
Our findings have three main implications. First, our 
results emphasise the under-investigated role of fatal 
acute myocardial infarction events with a recent or even 
current hospital admission with no mention of acute

myocardial infarction or a mention only as a comorbidity. 
These patients make up an equal share to the mortality 
burden of acute myocardial infarction within 28 days of 
an admission with a diagnosis of acute myocardial 
infarction. Their hospital records often contain primary 
diagnoses of circulatory disorders that share risk factors 
with acute myocardial infarction, or mention non-specific 
chest pain, dyspnoea, or syncope, which might herald the 
impending death from acute myocardial infarction.38 The 
case-fatality rate for acute myocardial infarction diagnosed 
as a primary disorder is already relatively low, so further 
improvements in hospital management might only 
produce small reductions in mortality burden. Hospital 
protocols aimed at the management of acute myocardial 
infarction might not benefit the clinical trajectory of 
patients with circulatory disorders or haemodynamic 
instability for whom no acute myocardial infarction was 
diagnosed during admission. If the available clinical 
information can be used to prudently generate a high 
clinical index of suspicion, followed by risk stratification 
and early management, these admissions could represent 
opportunities to reduce the mortality burden of acute 
myocardial infarction.
Second, about 51% of all mortality from acute myocardial 
infarction is attributable to out-of-hospital deaths without a 
recent hospital admission. The length of delay between 
symptom onset and a call for help has changed little since 
the 1980s.39–41 More than half of these patients have 
symptoms (commonly chest pain, breathlessness, or a 
general feeling of unwellness) for a duration of more than 
15 min before collapse.42 Strategies to shorten pre-hospital 
delays could result in substantial improvements in acute 
myocardial infarction survival in this group.43
Third, patients with comorbid diagnoses of acute 
myocardial infarction constitute roughly 19% of all 
admissions related to acute myocardial infarction and 
have case-fatality rates two to three times higher than 
those of patients with a main diagnosis of acute 
myocardial infarction. Patients with comorbid acute 
myocardial infarction diagnoses tend to be older and are 
more likely to be women than patients with main 
diagnoses and often have a stressor condition such as hip 
fracture or pneumonia recorded as the primary reason 
for admission. The universal definition of myocardial 
infarction subclassifies acute myocardial infarction into 
type 1 acute myocardial infarction, in which cardiac 
ischaemia is caused by the formation of an acute 
thrombus in the coronary arteries, and type 2, in which it 
is caused by an imbalance in the supply and demand for 
myocardial oxygen.44 Although we cannot be certain 
without full record review, the timing and secondary 
prioritisation of most acute myocardial infarctions 
recorded as comorbid events would suggest that they 
belong to the type 2 category, especially those 
accompanying disorders such as atrial fibrillation. The 
optimal management of type 2 acute myocardial 
infarction is currently uncertain, with risk assessment 
and optimisation of haemodynamic status remaining the 
mainstay of treatment for these patients.
The underlying method to reduce mortality after acute 
myocardial infarction is timely contact with the health 
system and diagnosis of the acute myocardial infarction. 
Our findings on the distributions of deaths from acute 
myocardial infarction show that substantial reductions in 
acute myocardial infarction mortality will require 
attention to the large proportion of these deaths that are 
not preceded by a hospital admission or are preceded by 
an admission for a another cause.
