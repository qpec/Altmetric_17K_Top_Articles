sensitivity in prostate carcinoma

Abstract
Background: TSPYL5, a putative tumor suppressor gene, belongs to the nucleosome assembly protein family.
The chromosomal location of the TSPYL5 gene is 8Q22.1, and its exact role in prostate cancer etiology remains
unclear. Further TSPYL5 gene and protein expression in prostate carcinoma cells and diseased tissues including its
susceptibility for epigenetic silencing is unknown. Also, not known is the variation in TSPYL5 protein expression
with regards to progression of prostatic carcinoma and its possible role in drug sensitivity.
Methods: TSPYL5, DNMT-1 and DNMT-B gene expression in DU145, LNCaP and RWPE-1 cells and prostate tumor
tissues was analyzed by qRT-PCR and RT-PCR. Demethylation experiments were done by treating DU145 and LNCaP
cells with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine in vitro. Methylation analysis of TSPYL5 gene was performed by methylation
specific PCR and pyrosequencing. TSPYL5 protein expression in benign and diseased prostate tumor tissues was
performed by immunohistochemistry and in the cells by Western blotting.
Results: TSPYL5 was differentially expressed in non-tumorigenic prostate epithelial cells (RWPE-1), androgen
independent (DU145), dependent (LNCaP) prostate carcinoma cells and tissues. Methylation-specific PCR and
pyrosequencing analysis identified an inverse relationship between DNA methylation and expression leading to the
silencing of TSPYL5 gene. Treatment of prostate carcinoma cells in which TSPYL5 was absent or low (DU145 and
LNCaP) with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine upregulated its expression in these cells.
Immunohistochemical studies clearly identified TSPYL5 protein in benign tissue and in tumors with Gleason score
(GS) of 6 and 7. TSPYL5 protein levels were very low in tumors of GS ≥ 8. TSPYL5 overexpression in LNCaP cells
increased the cell sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs such as docetaxel and paclitaxel, as measured by the cellular
viability. Furthermore, the cells also exhibited reduced CDKN1A expression with only marginal reduction in pAKT.
Conclusions: Decrease in TSPYL5 protein in advanced tumors might possibly function as an indicator of prostate tumor
progression. Its absence due to methylation-induced silencing can lead to reduced drug sensitivity in prostate carcinoma.

Background
Prostate cancer remains a major public health problem in
developed countries with an estimated 181,000 new cases
in 2016 in the United States [1]. The disease can progress
from a hormone sensitive to castrate-resistant phenotype
and eventually metastasize [2]. Multiple factors, including
screening using prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels, and
an aging population have resulted in increased frequency
of diagnosis of early stage prostate tumors, most of which
do not require immediate therapeutic intervention [3].
However, a small number of high-grade tumors are under-
diagnosed and undertreated.
Therapies for cancer including that of the prostate have
shifted from administering broadly acting cytotoxic drugs
to specific therapies targeted to each tumor. In order to
facilitate the shift, a “precision-medicine” approach where
tests that predict the clinical outcome of patients on the
basis of genes expressed by their tumors are likely to

Molecular signatures will have utility both in clinical
management of disease and in elucidating the mechanism
involved, thereby providing insight into potentially novel
therapies [4–6].
Testis specific Y-like-5 (TSPYL5, KIAA1750) is a mem-
ber of testis-specific protein Y-encoded-like (TSPY-L)
family of genes, whose functions are currently unknown
[7]. Testis specific Y-like (TSPYL) proteins are members
of the nucleosome assembly protein (NAP) superfamily
[8]. TSPYL proteins show high sequence homology to
NAP’s which possess a highly conserved NAP domain
(~180 amino acids) that participates in histone binding. In
general the NAP proteins participate in transcriptional
regulation [9] and in regulation of the cell cycle [10]. Also,
NAP-1 shuttles histones between the cytoplasm and
nucleus, assembles nucleosomes and affects transcription
of many genes by promoting chromatin fluidity [11].
Silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSG’s) by aberrant
DNA methylation at critical gene control regions plays a
central role in the development of cancers [12]. Alter-
nately, a decrease in methylation at specific sequences
could increase the expression of cancer-promoting genes
[13]. The TSPYL5 gene is of particular interest because,
apart from the documented role as a putative TSG in glio-
blastoma and gastric cancer [7, 14], it has been implicated
in cancer signaling pathways involving CDKN1A (p21,
WAF1/Cip 1) and pAKT in lung carcinoma cells [15].
CDKN1A has been implicated in both anti-proliferative,
pro-proliferative and survival roles [16]. Moreover, AKT
activation increases cell survival and proliferation [17]. It
is likely that TSPYL5 could participate in more than one
function, depending on the cell type and its epigenetic
modulation. Overall, little is known about the definite role
of this gene in carcinomas including that of the prostate.
It is hypothesized that more advanced prostate tumors
will have low TSPYL5 gene and protein expression com-
pared to moderately advanced or normal phenotype, and
such differential expression of TSPYL5 is due to epigenetic
modulation of this gene. To gain insight into the role of
TSPYL5 in prostate cancer, we investigated its expression,
methylation pattern, its role in signaling pathways and drug
sensitivity and presence of its protein with respect to
disease severity. In this study we report that TSPYL5 gene
and protein expression varied in prostate adenocarcinoma
(PC) cells and human benign and prostate tumor tissues as
analyzed by qRT-PCR and immunoblotting. Consistent
with variable TSPYL5 expression in cells and tissues, more
advanced tumor tissues had an inverse correlation between
methylation and gene or protein expression as studied by
methyl-specific PCR (MSP), pyrosequencing (PSQ) and im-
munohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. We also report that in
low TSPYL5 protein expressing PC cells, varied expression
of proteins such as pAKT was observed. Moreover, TSPYL5
may play a role in sensitivity to chemotherapy likely by
modulating pleiotropic protein such as CDKN1A.
Methods
Chemicals and antibodies
Demethylating agent 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (Decitabine,
DT) was from (Sigma Chemical Company, St Louis, MO).
Antibodies used were rabbit anti-TSPYL5 (Immunoblot),
rabbit anti- CDKN1A (Thr-145) (Santa Cruz Biotechnol-
ogy. Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit anti-TSPYL5 (Sigma, Immu-
nohistochemistry), rabbit anti-AKT, mouse anti-DNMT3B
(Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), anti-DNMT1, anti-
PTEN, anti-β-actin, anti-Histone-H3, anti- p-CDKN1A
(T-145), anti-pAKT (Ser- 473) (rabbit), including second-
ary HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit and mouse (Cell Signaling
Technology, Danvers, MA). Chemotherapy drugs pacli-
taxel (px) and docetaxel (dtx) were procured from the
local veterinary pharmacy.
Cells and patient tumor specimens
The PC cell lines, DU145, LNCaP and non-tumorigenic
(NT) prostate epithelial cells RWPE-1 were purchased
from ATCC (Manassas, VA). All of the carcinoma cells
were maintained in custom RPMI or DMEM/F12 media
with 10% FBS and Gentamycin. The RWPE-1 cells were
maintained in a keratinocyte serum free media with growth
factor supplements. The cells were tested routinely for
mycoplasma contamination with the MycoAlert luciferase
kit (Lonza, Allendale, NJ). Archival formalin fixed paraffin
embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens from normal, benign
or prostate carcinoma patients were obtained from the
Pathology department at the University of Missouri Hos-
pital after institutional IRB approval.
Demethylation of TSPYL5 in PC cells
The PC cells DU145 and LNCaP were treated with a
demethylation drug DT (0.5 μM) for 4 days with fresh
addition of DT every 12 h. Subsequently, total RNA was
isolated and reverse transcribed to cDNA. qRT-PCR was
performed to analyze TSPYL5 gene expression in drug
treated and untreated samples.
cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification
Total RNA from prostate carcinoma cells (DU145 and
LNCaP), epithelial cells (RWPE-1) and FFPE prostate
tissues was extracted using RNeasy or RNeasy FFPE kits
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA), respectively. cDNA was generated
from total RNA using a cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-rad,
Hercules, CA). PCR was performed with TSPYL5 primers.
β-actin was used as a housekeeping gene. The PCR condi-
tions were as follows: denaturation at 98 °C for 1 min,
followed by 28 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s and
70 °C for 30 s, with a final extension at 70 °C for 8 min.
The amplified PCR products were analyzed by 2% agarose

 gel electrophoresis containing Gel Red (Biotium, Hayward,
CA). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), was per-
formed with CFX Connect and a Sybr Green reaction
(Biorad). The following primers were used for TSPYL5
PCR: Forward, 5′-TGGGCCCTTCTACTGGTGAACTT
T-3′; Reverse, 5′- TCACCTGGAGCCACAGCATAATG
A-3′. The mRNA expression in tissues was analyzed and
the relative cumulative density was calculated by measur-
ing area under curve (AUC) for each sample using an
image processing and analysis program (Image J, NIH).
Percentage average was obtained for each group and an
arbitrary number of 1 was assigned for highest percentage
group and subsequent groups were assigned numbers
relative to 1 for graphical representation.
Genomic DNA isolation and bisulfite conversion
The genomic DNA isolated from PC cells using DNeasy
Blood & Tissue Kit or tumor tissues using QIAamp DNA
FFPE Tissue Kit (Qiagen) was bisulfite-modified with EZ-
DNA Methylation-Gold Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA)
according to manufacturer’s instructions. The bisulfite
reaction was carried out with 500 ng genomic DNA.
Bisulfite converted DNA samples were stored at −20 °C
until further use.
Methyl specific PCR and pyrosequencing analysis
Methyl specific PCR (MSP) was performed in PC cells as
well as FFPE tumor tissues using bisulfite-converted DNA
with primers designed to include two CpG dinucleotides in
each forward and reverse primer. Two sets of primers
(CpG island) were designed; one, for methylated sequence
(which retains CpG complementarity); 5′-GAGGTTA-
TAGTTTAGGGGGAGTTG-3′; R- 5′- CCAAACAACAC
AAATACAAACTAAC-3′. For unmethylated sequences
(complimentary to TpG sequence), the primers F- 5′-GA
GAAATTTGTTGAGATTTAAAGTGA-3′; R- 5′CCATC
ACAAAAAAACATAATA-CACC-3′ were used. The pres-
ence of a methylated band in PCR is indicative of methyla-
tion in the original sequence [18]. Primers were designed
using MethPrimer program [19]. The MSP and unmethy-
lated sequence (USP) PCR bands in tissues upon gel elec-
trophoresis (2% agarose) were analyzed for AUC using the
Image J program. The percent methylation for each sample
was calculated using AUC of methylated A (M) and
unmethylated bands A (U) as follows: Percentage = A (M)
×100/A (M) + A (U).
Pyrosequencing (PSQ) of genomic DNA to quantitate
the methylation of individual cytosine residues was per-
formed as described earlier [20]. PSQ is a fast, reliable and
quantitative method for analysis of CpG methylation [21].
Methylation analysis of DU145, LNCaP and RWPE-1 cells
was performed with TSPYL5 specific primers (CpG island
shores) which consisted of a forward (5′- AGAGAAAGT
AAAGGTGGATGTTATAATGT-3′), biotinylated reverse
(5′-Biosg/ATACTTCCATCCCTTACTATATAACCTA-3′
) and sequencing primers (5′-AAAGGAGGTGTTGAT
AT-3′)
designed for a TSPYL5
promoter sequence,
followed by DNA sequencing in a Pyro Mark ID system
by employing the Pyro Gold reagents kit (Life Technolo-
gies, Grand Island, NY). The primers were designed using
a PSQ assay design program. The average degree of
methylation at four CpG sites was analyzed using Pyro
Mark ID software and results are depicted as percentage
methylation.
Patient samples and IHC analyses
IHC studies were performed as described previously [22]
to identify the protein expression levels and cellular
localization of TSPYL5 in non-malignant and malignant
FFPE human prostate tissues using intelliPATH FLX
(Biocare Medical). The analyzed tissue specimens in-
cluded core tissue from patients with prostate adenocar-
cinoma (Gleason scores (GS) ranging from 6 to 9),
normal and benign prostate tissues. Human testis tissue
was used as positive control to detect TSPYL5 protein
expression.
Immunoreactivity was scored by a board-certified path-
ologist (ME) in at least five random fields at 400× magnifi-
cation in each section and the intensity of protein staining
was scored on a 0–3+ scale (0 = no staining, 1 + = weak
staining, 2 + = moderate staining, and 3 + = strong staining).
The percentage of cells staining positive was scored on 1 -
4 scale (1 = 0–25% positive PC cells, 2 = 26–50% positive
cells, 3 = 51–75% positive cells, and 4 = 76–100% positive
cells). Composite score (CS) (0–12) was obtained by multi-
plying the staining intensity and percent of immunoreactive
cells. Statistical significance was evaluated by the Mann–
Whitney test. P < 0.05 was considered significant. H & E
staining was performed according to standard procedures
described in literature. Grading is assigned according to

sus Statement on Gleason Grading of Prostate Cancer (Ep-

Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on

TSPYL5 overexpression in LNCaP cells
For overexpression of TSPYL5, LNCaP cells were plated
in 6 well plates (0.3-1 ×106/well) and allowed to grow to
70–80% confluency at 37 °C. The mammalian expression
vector TSPYL5/pCMV6-AN-GFP (PV-TSPYL5) or pCMV
6-AN-GFP
(PV)
(Origene,
Rockville,
MD)
with
N-
terminal tGFP tag was transiently transfected into LNCaP
cells using Lipofectamine 3000 (ThermoFisher Scientific,
Walthem, MA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol
and were allowed to grow for 72 h, harvested and subse-
quently used for further studies.

 Cell viability
A cell viability assay was performed as described previ-
ously [24] using a WST-1 assay (Roche Applied Science,
Indianapolis, IN) with or without 10 nM of chemotherapy
drugs px or dtx. The results are expressed as percent vi-
able cells after respective analysis. All experiments were
performed in triplicate.
Immunoblotting
Protein was extracted from whole cell lysates using the M-
PER mammalian protein extraction reagent (Thermo
Scientific), and the concentrations were estimated by the
Bradford method. Equal amounts of protein (35 μg) were
loaded on to the gel. Subsequently, the proteins were
blotted on to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane
was probed separately with primary antibodies for TSPYL5,
CDKN1A, and AKT including P-CDKN1A (Thr 145),
pAKT (S-473), β-actin, histone H3, PTEN, DNMT-1 and
DNMT3b. Following incubation with the primary antibody
at 4 °C overnight, the membrane was incubated with a
horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody and
visualized with Luminate Forte Western HRP substrate
(Millipore, Billerica, MA). The blot was imaged in a Kodak
imaging station (Carestream Health). The protein band
ratios were calculated from the protein band intensities
obtained using Image J program.
Statistical analysis
Independent experiments were performed a minimum of
three times. Statistical analyses on experiments were
performed by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test for pro-
tein expression evaluations, one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) for RT-PCR and Mann–Whitney U test for im-
munohistochemical analysis. The graphs were generated
using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software Inc., San
Diego, CA). P ≤ 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
TSPYL5 gene and protein was variably expressed in
prostate carcinoma and NT prostate epithelial cells
TSPYL5 gene expression was analyzed in triplicate in PC
cells (DU145, and LNCaP) and non-tumor (NT) epithelial
cells (RWPE-1) by qRT-PCR analysis. qRT-PCR analysis
indicated variable TSPYL5 mRNA expression in the cells
tested (Fig. 1a). While the TSPYL5 mRNA expression was
not significant between RWPE-1 and LNCaP (P ≥ 0.05), the
expression was significantly low in DU145 cells (P = 0.02).
Total cell lysates were analyzed for TSPYL5 protein expres-
sion by immunoblot analysis. As anticipated, the protein
expression was very insignificant in DU145 but low to
moderate in LNCaP and RWPE-1 cells (Fig. 1b), respect-
ively. The difference in TSPYL5 protein expression was
evaluated based on protein band intensities (Fig. 1c). The
decrease in TSPYL5 protein expression was found to be
highly significant between RWPE-1 and DU145 (P = 0.001)
while moderate difference was observed between RWPE-1
and LNCaP, (P = 0.04) cells.
TSPYL5 gene is methylated and responds to
demethylation drug DT
Due to the differential expression of mRNA in various cells
used in this study, we analyzed the TSPYL5 gene methylation
status in all the cells. First, we treated endogenously absent
or low TSPYL5 expressing PC cells DU145 and LNCaP with
DT. DT was effective in strong induction of TSPYL5 mRNA
in LNCaP (P = 0.001) and DU145 (P = 0.0021) cells com-
pared to wild type (WT) counterparts (Fig. 2a), suggesting
that TSPYL5 gene is a target primarily for aberrant methyla-
tion. Next, in order to analyze the presence of DNA methy-
lating enzymes DNMT1 and DNMT3B, an RT- PCR was
performed to observe the variation in mRNA of these en-
zymes across the cells tested. As shown (Fig. 2b), all the cells
had mRNA expression of these enzymes. Interestingly, it also
was evident in DU145 cells where endogenous TSPYL5 ex-
pression was very low, both DNMT1 and DNMT3b mRNA
expression was relatively high compared to the other cells, in
which one or the other of the enzyme mRNA expression
was low. Varying DNMT1 and DNMT3B protein expression
was also observed in the nuclear fraction of the cells.
Histone–H3 was used as a housekeeping protein.
We further investigated the TSPYL5 gene methylation
status by MSP analysis. The MSP primers were designed
within the chromosomal 8 regions (97,277,582-97,277,700)
of the TSPYL5 gene (CpG islands, Fig. 3a) and sodium
bisulfite-modified genomic DNA was used as a template.
MSP results revealed a differential methylation pattern
among the cells (Fig. 3b). TSPYL5 gene exhibited decreased
methylated band intensity in the following order: DU145 >
LNCaP > RWPE-1. An intense methylation band was ob-
served in DU145 (P =0.001) and LNCaP (P = 0.012) cells
compared to RWPE-1 (Fig. 3c). While DU145 cells had no
unmethylated band, the LNCaP cells had a very dim
unmethylated band compared to RWPE-1 cells, which had
an intermediate intensity unmethylated band.
In order to further investigate the extent of methylation
in the cells, we analyzed a different chromosomal region
within the TSPYL5 gene (Chr 8: 97278367–97278417) for
an individual cytosine methylation pattern using PSQ.
PSQ quantifies methylation in explicit sequence context,
thereby enabling several consecutive CpG sites to be
quantified individually in a single assay. We selected the
above region (CpG island shore, Fig. 3a) to avoid excessive
CG density for design of PSQ primers. Four CpG sites
were selected (Position 1–4, Fig. 4a and Additional file 1:
Table S1) to analyze the extent of methylation in cytosine
residues. Cumulative methylation percentage for individ-
ual cell type (Fig. 4b) indicated that the methylation per-
centage was highest (1.2 fold; P = 0.04) in DU145 cells

 relative to RWPE-1. The difference in methylation per-
centage of cytosine residues at the position of interest
between LNCaP and RWPE-1 was not statistically signifi-
cant (P > 0.05). The pyrograms depicting the methylation
status of the cytosine residues in the selected sequence for
DU145, LNCaP and RWPE-1 cells and the comparative
methylation percentage of individual cytosine residues are
shown in (Additional file 2: Figure S1).
TSPYL5 mRNA is expressed in human prostate tumor
tissues and modulated by gene methylation
After identifying an inverse relationship between TSPYL5
mRNA and the presence of methylation in NT and PC
cells, we sought to extend the analysis of gene expression
and DNA methylation to benign and prostate tumor tis-
sues. TSPYL5 mRNA expression was observed in normal
(n = 3) and benign samples (n = 9) (Fig. 5a). In total, 21

(P = 0.04**) cells. All the values were calculated after subtracting the background intensity. Analysis was done in three repeat individual experiments

 tumor samples were analyzed, out of which four samples
had a GS of 6, fourteen samples had GS-7 and three sam-
ples had GS - 8 or- 9. Tumor tissues with GS ≥ 8 exhibited
almost no TSPYL5 expression (Fig. 5b, T19-21). Variable
intermediate expression was observed with tumors with a
GS-6 or −7 (T1-T18), however, in a few tumor GS-7 sam-
ples (T7, T12 and T14) very weak or no TSPYL5 mRNA ex-
pression was observed. These three samples had Gleason
pattern (4 + 3). The graphical representation of TSPYL5
mRNA expression in different tissues are depicted in (Add-
itional file 3: Figure S2 (a)). Densitometry gel analysis indi-
cated a decrease in the TSPYL5 mRNA expression in
tissues with GS-7 (P = 0.012) and GS ≥ 8 (P = 0.001).
For MSP DNA methylation studies in tissues, the gen-
omic DNA was isolated from normal, select benign and
tumor samples (n = 3 each) and bisulfite converted before
methylation analysis. MSP analysis with CpG island
primers, demonstrate that methylation was low in normal

 and benign samples and lower or intermediate in graded
tumor tissues (GS-6 or-7). Unfortunately, we had very lit-
tle starting material of the tumor tissues with GS =7 (T7,
T12, T14) were very little and were unable to assess the
methylation analysis in these tissues. However in tissues
with GS ≥ 8 increased methylation was observed (Fig. 5c).
The cumulative methylation percentage is depicted in
(Additional file 3: Figure S2 (b)). Significant methylation
was observed between benign and tumor tissues (GS-7;
P = 0.047) and GS ≥ 8 (P = 0.032). Furthermore, we ana-
lyzed the expression of DNMT’s in high grade advanced
PC tumor tissues (Gleason score, GS ≥ 8) by IHC. It ap-
pears that predominantly DNMT3b protein was expressed
while DNMT1 was found to be relatively low or not de-
tected (Additional file 4: Figure S3).
TSPYL5 protein expression in tumor tissues varies with
advance grade
IHC analysis of TSPYL5 in human normal prostate and
tumor tissues identified protein expression patterns that
mirrored the tissue mRNA expression data. A minimum
of three tissues were analyzed in each case. Normal
human testis tissue (Fig. 6a) was used as positive control
for TSPYL5 expression. The testis tissue showed strong
membrane, nuclear and cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 6b). In
benign prostate tissue, benign acini lined by inner
secretory epithelial cells and outer basal cell layer (Fig. 6c),
the TSPYL5 expression was prominent in the cytoplasmic
membrane (Fig. 6d). The prostate adenocarcinoma speci-
mens with GS-6 (3 + 3), exhibited both nuclear and cyto-
plasmic staining with a composite score (CS) of 12 (3x4)
(Fig. 6f). Prostate adenocarcinoma cases with GS-7 (3 +
4), show moderate cytoplasmic and membrane staining
with CS of 8 (2x4) (Fig. 6h). Interestingly, in the tumor
specimens with GS-8 (4 + 4) or above the staining inten-
sity was very weak (CS ≤ 1) and is mainly confined to the
cell membrane. There is a loss of nuclear and cytoplasmic
staining (Fig. 6j). Corresponding H & E stains for testis,
benign or prostate tumor tissues were processed in paral-
lel (Fig. 6a, c, e, g and i). The composite scores obtained in
tumor tissues with GS-6 or-7 were higher relative to the
GS-8. The difference in protein staining intensity between
benign and tumor tissues with GS −8 (P = 0.012) and GS-
7 (P = 0.032) was significant, while no significant differ-
ence was observed in staining intensities between benign
and tumor tissues with GS-6 (P > 0.05). Further analysis of
tissues with GS 9 (4 + 5) compared to benign tissues (P =
0.008). (Additional file 5: Figure S4). Altogether, TSPYL5
expression diminishes in high grade prostate carcinoma
compared to the benign tissue or intermediate grade

alleles was observed in benign and tumor tissues with GS-6 or-7, while strong methylated bands was observed in tumor tissues with GS ≥ 8.
Densitometry gel analysis indicated a decrease in the TSPYL5 mRNA expression in tissues with GS-7 (P = 0.012) and GS ≥ 8 (P = 0.001). PCR with

TSPYL5 protein in cellular fractions and relative
expression of other proteins
We analyzed the expression of TSPYL5 and other proteins
including CDKN1Aand pAKT in, DU145, LNCaP and
RWPE-1 cells (Fig. 7a). The protein bands were analyzed
(Fig. 7b) by image quantification software as described in
the methods. TSPYL5 protein expression was absent in
DU145, low in LNCaP and moderate in RWPE-1 cells.
To study the co-expression of other cellular proteins in
all the cells, we focused on two important proteins
CDKN1A and AKT which participate in cellular prolifera-
tion, drug sensitivity and cell survival. Interestingly,
CDKN1A expression was low in DU145 cells in which
TSPYL5 expression was insignificant. However, high
CDKN1A expression was observed in LNCaP compared
to RWPE-1 cells in which the endogenous TSPYL5 is ei-
ther
low
or
moderate,
respectively.
Phosphorylated
CDKN1A (P- CDKN1A, Thr145) was absent in all cell
lines. Variable AKT expression was observed in all these
cells. Furthermore, LNCaP and RWPE-1 cells had pAKT
expression, but no pAKT was observed in DU145. While
PTEN (a tumor suppressor protein, TSP) is expressed in
both DU145
and
RWPE-1 cells

 expression was absent or moderate, no expression was ob-
served in LNCaP cells. Based on the protein band density
(Fig. 7b), the ratios of pAKT/TSPYL5 in different cells
were 0.25 (DU145), 18.9 (LNCaP) and 3.46 (RWPE-1).
Also, the ratios between CDKN1A/TSPYL5 was 0.14
(DU145), 16.8 (LNCaP) and 3.7 (RWPE-1). These ratios
indicate the differences in the relative expression of pAKT
and CDKN1A in relation to TSPYL5.
TSPYL5 overexpressing LNCaP cells exhibit enhanced
sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs
In order to evaluate the drug sensitivity in WT and TSPYL5
overexpressing LNCaP cells, we tested the effect of two
standard drugs used for PC treatment, paclitaxel (px) and
docetaxel (dtx). Cellular viability in the presence of each
drug (10 nM) was tested in WT, cells transfected with vector
only
(PV)
and
TSPYL5
overexpressing
(PV-TSPYL5)
LNCaP cells. Dtx decreased the WT and PV LNCaP cell
viability by 40% (P = 0.012, P = 0.014). However, PV-TSPYL5
LNCaP cells exhibited enhanced sensitivity to dtx (62%, P =
0.008) compared to WT cells without the drug (Fig. 8a).
Similar results were observed in the presence of px (Add-
itional file 7: Figure S5). Changes in pAKT, CDKN1A and
PTEN protein expression in TSPYL5 overexpressing LNCaP
cells were analyzed by Western analysis. We noted a reduc-
tion in CDKN1A (P = 0.009) in PV-TSPYL5 LNCaP cells
which originally had high endogenous CDKN1A. Only a
mild decrease (P ≥ 0.05) was observed with pAKT and no
changes in PTEN expression (Fig. 8b and c).
Discussion
In this study we have demonstrated that the presence of
DNA methylation in the 5′ region of the gene is negatively
associated with expression of TSPYL5 mRNA and protein in
PC cells, NT cells and clinical prostate tissue samples.
Methylation induced TSPYL5 gene silencing was previously
reported in glioma and gastric cancer types [15, 16]. The
TSPYL5 protein expression mirrored the expression pattern
of mRNA in the cells (DU145, LNCaP or RWPE-1). The
TSPYL proteins are members of the NAP superfamily of pro-
teins [9] that have been shown to bind to proteins involved
in transcription, cell cycle regulation [25], and shuttling his-
tones between nucleus and cytoplasm [26]. However, it is not
clear whether such a function for TSPYL5 exists in PC cells.
Previous studies with colorectal HCT116 cells indicated
that both DNMT1 and DNMT3B enzymes were essential
to methylate TSPYL5 gene promoter regions [15]. While
one or the other enzyme was observed in the cells tested in
this study, we observed only DNMT3B protein was pre-
dominantly expressed in more advanced PC tissues in
which TSPYL5 was absent. Earlier studies in prostate can-
cer have analyzed various methyltransferases and found that
DNMT1 expression was found to be lower than DNMT3b.
Further, de novo methylation remains in DNMT1 knockout
embryonic stem cells and the role of DNMT1 in tumor
methylation remains ambiguous [27]. Depending on the
cellular context, the TSPYL5 gene might be differentially
targeted for methylation by methyltransferases.
Previous studies have shown a correlation between
methylation in chromosome 8 region (Chr 8: 97278129–
97278175) and loss of TSPYL5 gene expression in lung car-
cinoma cells, although, no tissue studies or normal cell stud-
ies have been done [17]. While CpG islands are important
to regulate gene expression [28], previous studies suggest
that the lower density CpG shores of islands may also be
important [29]. Our studies with MSP analysis of the CpG
island identified methylation of the TSPYL5 gene in PC cells
and tissues. As anticipated, PSQ analysis of CpG dinucleo-
tides on the 5′ shore of the CpG island revealed higher
methylation of the four cytosine residues (Chr 8: 97278367–

 97278417) in DU145 cells relative to other cell lines. Only a
subtle difference was observed in individual cytosine methy-
lation between, LNCaP and RWPE-1. This is in keeping
with our observations that DU145 had the least TSPYL5
expression due to methylation-induced gene silencing.
Planning treatment for prostate cancer patients relies on
histopathological grading by GS [30] which currently lacks
a precise molecular correlate [6, 7]. There is a critical need
to identify companion biomoleules that distinguish more
advanced phenotype tumors within intermediate GS-7
specimens. Our studies identified TSPYL5 mRNA and pro-
tein expression in benign and tumor tissues with a GS-6
or-7. High grade tumors with GS ≥ 8 had the least expres-
sion of TSPYL5, likely due to DNA methylation. Interest-
ingly, a few GS-7 tumor samples with Gleason pattern (4 +
3) had no message for TSPYL5. At this time, it is not clear
whether the absence of TSPYL5 mRNA expression in
tissues with GS 7 (4 + 3) would indicate any undetected
higher-grade disease. Further studies with more tissues are
needed to assess this possibility. Taken together, these data
suggest that the absence of TSPYL5 may be an indicator of
more advanced prostate cancer disease.
MSP analysis of the TSPYL5 gene indicated a mixture of
methylated
and
unmethylated
bands
in
benign
and
intermediate-grade tumors with GS-6 or −7, while GS-8
tumors had predominantly methylated bands suggesting a
methylation induced TSPYL5 silencing in these tumors.
Previous studies indicated that TSPYL5 could be an inde-
pendent marker of poor outcome in breast cancer based on
their high expression in aggressive basal-like breast cancers
[31]. On the contrary, we observed both by mRNA expres-
sion and IHC that TSPYL5 expression diminishes in high
grade tumors. Such a difference in TSPYL5 expression could
be exploited to identify the clinical behavior of intermediate
grade prostate tumors (GS-7). A recent report suggested the
use of higher levels of SNPs-rs2735839 to stratify patients
with GS-7 because of the association with aggressive PC
[32]. However, to classify GS-7 patients based on diminished
TSPYL5, large cohorts of prostate tumor samples will need
to be investigated. Studies along this direction are in
progress in our laboratory.
In addition to its anti-proliferative role, CDKN1A is also
vital to proliferation and survival. A previous study reported
that knockdown of TSPYL5 increased the endogenous
expression of p53 and its downstream target CDKN1A in
MCF7 breast carcinoma cells [31]. It has been reported that
in lung carcinoma cells, TSPYL5 was able to suppress
CDKN1A by modulating PTEN/AKT pathway [17]. Also,
TSPYL5 gene silencing increased the CDKN1A protein ex-
pression and caused growth reduction in cells [17]. However,
we observed that TSPYL5 gene silenced cells (DU145)
exhibited very minimal expression of CDKN1A. Conversely,

caused reduction in cell viability of WT and PV only LNCaP cells (P = 0.012*, P = 0.014**). Dtx effect was more pronounced in cells treated with
PV-TSPYL5 (P = 0.008***). b Various protein expression in PV-TSPYL5- and PV-LNCaP cells (c) Graph denoting relative protein band intensities in

 low or moderately TSPYL5 expressing LNCaP and RWPE-1
cells showed high and relatively low CDKN1A expression.
We also observed a decrease in CDKN1Aprotein expression
in TSPYL5 overexpressing LNCaP cells. However, in con-
trast to lung carcinoma cells [17] LNCaP cells lack PTEN, so
any involvement of TSPYL5 in modulating CDKN1A must
work by a PTEN-independent mechanism [33].
Our observations identified that even low TSPYL5 ex-
pressing cells (eg: LNCaP) had higher pAKT. Also, TSPYL5
expressing RWPE-1 cells expressed basal pAKT, albeit low
levels compared to LNCaP cells. This in sharp contrast to
the observation made in lung carcinoma cells [17] that high
TSPLY-5 expression can activate AKT. The exact role of
TSPYL5 is not clear in modulating AKT expression in PC
cells and could vary depending on the cellular phenotype.
Mounting evidence suggests that TSG’s play an important
role in the response to a variety of chemotherapeutic drugs
such as px, 5-Fluorouracil, cisplatin and trastuzumab [34, 35].
It was reported that a decrease in retinoblastoma (Rb) protein,
a TSP
, in sarcoma cells conferred resistance to doxorubicin
and cisplatin [36]. PC cells and glioblastoma cells deficient in
Rb were resistant to cisplatin and doxorubicin, respectively
[37, 38]. Similarly, p53 inactivation resulted in reduced sensi-
tivity to cisplatin but not px in ovarian carcinoma cells, sug-
gesting that the role of p53 in response to chemotherapy
depends on both cellular context as well as the class of
chemotherapeutic compounds [39]. Increased expression of
CDKN1A leads to chemoresistance, and its loss sensitizes the
cells to chemotherapy response [40, 41]. Interestingly, it was
reported earlier that LNCaP cells were resistant for dtx and
knockdown of p53 protein increases its sensitivity to the drug
by decreasing CDKN1A [42]. Previous studies had shown that
increase in TSPYL5 can compete with USP7, a deubiqutiny-
lating protein thereby decreasing p53 in MCF 7 cells [31]. Our
studies show that reduction in CDKN1A in TSPYL5 overex-
pressing LNCaP cells exhibit more sensitivity for dtx and px
compared to WTcells. All the above studies highlight the pos-
sible roles of TSP’s in chemotherapy response. Our studies
suggest that increased TSPYL5 enhances the sensitivity of the
cells to chemotherapy drugs, likely by downregulating
CDKN1A. While it is tempting to suggest that TSPYL5 status
in PC cells could be indicative of predicting chemotherapy re-
sponse, further studies are needed to substantiate this notion.
In keeping with the previous studies regarding the role of
TSP’s in chemosensitivity [40, 41], we speculate that the re-
sponse to chemotherapy drugs in TSPYL5 expressing PC cells
likely may vary depending upon the cellular context and the
type of chemotherapy drug.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our studies demonstrate the potential
significance of TSPYL5 in prostate carcinoma and that
it could have more than one function depending on the
cellular phenotype. Methylation of this gene in tumor
tissues correlated inversely with its mRNA and protein
expression. Reduced gene product in high GS tumors
suggests that TSPYL5 could likely function as an indi-
cator of more advanced prostate carcinoma. Absence of
TSPYL5 in the PC cells could influence the expression
of pleotropic proteins such as CDKN1A, which has
been implicated in pro-proliferative, survival and anti-
apoptotic roles. Further, the absence of TSPYL5 in PC
cells may have consequences similar to other canonical
TSP’s such as PTEN or Rb in becoming resistant to
chemotherapy drug treatment.
