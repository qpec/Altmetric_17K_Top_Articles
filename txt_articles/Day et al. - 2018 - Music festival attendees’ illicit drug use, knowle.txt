Abstract
Background: Drug checking is a harm reduction strategy which allows users to check the content and purity of
illicit drugs. Although drug checking has been trialled internationally, with demonstrated value as a harm reduction
and health promotion strategy, the use of such services in Australia remains a contentious issue.
This study aimed to investigate the proportion and patterns of illicit drug use among young people, their attitudes
towards drug checking at festivals and the potential impact of drug checking on intended drug use behaviour.
Methods: The survey was conducted at a major Australian music festival in 2016. Data was collected from a sample
of festival attendees (n = 642) aged between 18 and 30 years. A descriptive analysis of the data was performed.
Results: Nearly three-quarters (73.4%) of participants reported that they had used illicit drugs in the past 12 months,
most commonly cannabis (63.9%) and ecstasy (59.8%). A large proportion of participants believed ‘somewhat’ or ‘a lot’
that drug checking services could help users seek help to reduce harm (86.5%) and that drug checking services should
be combined with harm reduction advice (84.9%). However, two thirds of the participants agreed ‘somewhat’ or ‘a lot’
that drug sellers may use this service as a quality control mechanism (68.6%). Approximately half (54.4%) indicated they
would be highly likely and a third (32.7%) would be somewhat likely to utilise free drug checking services should they
be available at music festivals. When asked whether the results of drug checking would influence their drug use
behaviour, participants reported that they would not take substances shown to contain methamphetamine (65.1%),
ketamine (57.5%) or para-methoxyamphetamine (PMA) (58.4%).
Conclusion: The majority of festival attendees aged 18–30 participating in this study reported a history of illicit drug
use and were in favour of the provision of free drug checking at festivals. A considerable proportion reported that the
results of drug checking would influence their drug use behaviour. The findings of this study can contribute to the
debate regarding whether drug checking services could potentially play a major role in harm reduction and health
promotion programming for young people attending festivals.
Background
In the most recent National Drug Strategy Household
Survey (NDSHS) in 2016, almost 8.5 million (42.6%)
Australians aged 14 years and over reported use of illicit
drugs in their lifetime, with 3.1 million (15.6%) reporting
use in the last month [1]. Prevalence was highest in the
20–29 years age group, of which 28.2% reported use in
the last 12 months [1].
Internationally, music festival attendees report particu-
larly high levels of illicit drug use compared with the
general population [2–4]. Consistent with this, studies
undertaken at festivals across Australia reflect a consid-
erably higher rate of illicit drug use than is seen in
same-age groups in the general population. A cross-
sectional study of 1365 adolescents, conducted at a
music festival in Australia in 2011, found 52% had used
illicit drugs at least once, with 25% doing so in the previ-
ous month [5]. Another study conducted from 2005 to

 2008 in Australia demonstrated that 44% of music festi-
val attendees had used illicit drugs in the last month [6].
Risks associated with the use of illicit drugs such as
methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA (3,4-methy-
lenedioxymethamphetamine) or ecstasy) include adverse
side effects such as hyperthermia, seizures, hyponatrae-
mia, rhabdomyolysis and multi-organ failure causing
death [7]. In addition, the inclusion of other substances
in illicit drugs may also cause significant harm, both
through an unexpected increase in purity resulting in
overdoses and through the undesired inclusion of addi-
tives such as paramethoxyamphetamine (PMA), buty-
lone and methylone [8, 9].
Due to the considerable discrepancy between the
prevalence of drug use in populations of festival goers
and the general population, it can be theorised that festi-
val goers are more vulnerable to these harmful outcomes
and are therefore an important group to be targeted for
harm reduction and education.
Harm reduction
Several organisations in the USA and Europe offer an-
onymous drug checking services to the public [10].
Countries such as France and Spain, which have a com-
parable legal stance on drug use to Australia, have active
drug checking services available as a harm reduction
intervention by communities and local governments [11,
12]. On-site drug checking interventions are already in
place in the Netherlands and Austria [13]. Dutch citizens
have been able to test their illicit drugs at government-
funded
Drug
Information
and
Monitoring
System
(DIMS) facilities since the 1990s, for the purposes of
harm reduction and prevention [14]. Utilisation of these
services has been demonstrated to influence user behav-
iour [15]. The Trans European Drug Information (TEDI)
program saw drug checking being offered at a number
of festivals across Europe, helping to profile the global
drug market and creating a number of harm reduction
avenues that are aligned with drug checking [16]. Sub-
stance education, psychosocial counselling and referral
options can be offered to an at-risk population while
drug analysis is being performed [17]. Drug checking
has led to an awareness of circulating harmful sub-
stances, which has resulted in a decline of these prod-
ucts on the market in subsequent years [2, 18, 19]. It
may also allow for the implementation of early warning
systems to inform drug users of dangerous substances
before additional harm can result [2, 16].
However, some concerns exist regarding drug check-
ing being perceived as encouraging drug use and the
limitations of accurate substance detection of reagent
testing kits [20]. These kits are limited in the number of
substances they can identify, are operator-dependent
and do not identify non-drug components [21]. On-site
laboratory-grade testing, as used in the CheckIt program
in Austria [17], provides more accurate and detailed ana-
lyses for consumers about a wider range of substances.
There is also the perception that drug checking could
act as a quality control mechanism for drug dealers [22].
Community perceptions
Research commissioned
by the
Australian
National
Council on Drugs found that more than 82% of a sample
of 2335 Australians aged between 16 and 25 years were
in favour of the introduction of drug checking [23].
Despite public support and backing from numerous
prominent political and law enforcement figures [24, 25],
legislation for drug checking at festivals has yet to be
passed by any state government in Australia. The main
arguments against drug checking are that there is a lack of
evidence to support its efficacy and that it may appear that
the government is condoning drug use [26]. However, a
motion in August 2016 passed unopposed through the
Australian Senate calling for the introduction of evidence-
based harm reduction policies to counteract harmful drug
use, including the cessation of sniffer dog use at festivals
and implementation of drug checking trials [25].
This study aims to increase our understanding of atti-
tudes and behaviours towards drug checking services
among music festival patrons. To our knowledge, this is
the first study based at a music festival to survey at-
tendees about drug checking services in Australia and
will provide valuable knowledge that will contribute to
the ongoing debate surrounding drug testing.
Methods
Survey development and outcome measures
The survey content and structure was guided by previ-
ous research in the area [1, 13, 27] and members of the
research team with expertise in the fields of drug and al-
cohol, sexual health, health promotion and public health.
All survey respondents were asked about their demo-
graphics, illicit drug use and attitudes towards drug
checking services. Those who indicated a history of illicit
drug use were further questioned about their attitudes
and concerns towards drug content and purity, attempts
to find out about the content and purity of drugs they
had previously taken and the likelihood of using a free
drug checking service.
The data collected was predominately quantitative,
with the exception of one open-ended question asking
drug users why they had never attempted to find out
about the content/purity of their drugs (if applicable).
Two waves of pilot-testing of the survey were conducted
with groups of young adults (n = 10 and n = 12, respect-
ively) who were representative of the target audience,
with the data collection tool refined after each wave.

 Recruitment and data collection
The data collection for this study was undertaken over
2 days at a major Australian popular music festival as
part of an established sexual health promotion stall. Par-
ticipants were recruited based on their estimated age be-
ing within the target range of 18–30 years. Participants
were given a participant information statement and were
informed about what the survey involved and the pur-
pose of the study. Completion of the survey was taken
as consent. Participants completed the paper-based survey
anonymously and independently and placed the survey in
a closed box to ensure confidentiality. No identifying in-
formation was collected to ensure anonymity of partici-
pants. Participants were only approached during daylight
hours to minimise the likelihood of participants being in-
toxicated at time of completion and were not eligible to
participate if they were visibly intoxicated. No incentives
were provided. The surveys were provided by independent
researchers not linked to the health promotion stall, who
were available to answer participants’ questions if re-
quired. Participants were given a short summary of what
drug checking is and the information it can provide.
Data analysis
Analyses were conducted using SPSS Version 22. Chi-
square tests were conducted to determine associations
between categorical variables and t test for continuous
variables. A p value of < 0.05 was considered to be statis-
tically significant. Missing data was treated by excluding
the participant from that question.
The open-ended question was coded thematically to
identify reasons for not attempting to find out about
drug content and purity. Initial codes were created based
on a review of the complete data set by two researchers,
who then created the coding scheme through discussion
and reaching consensus. This coding scheme was then
applied to the data.
Results
Socio-demographic and drug use characteristics
A total of 642 people between the ages of 18 and 30 years
participated in the survey. The majority of survey re-
sponders were female (60.5%), aged 18–21 years (62.2%),
single (56.8%), heterosexual (90.4%), part-time employed
(52.6%) and/or studying full-time (48.9%). A dispropor-
tionate number of females were surveyed, although chi-
square testing failed to demonstrate a statistically signifi-
cant difference in the prevalence of drug use in the past
12 months between males and females (p = 0.060). Most
participants reported having used alcohol (97.8%) at least
once during their lifetime or illicit drugs (73.4%) at least
once during the last 12 months. The drugs most com-
monly used in the previous 12 months were cannabis,
ecstasy and cocaine (63.9, 59.8 and 34.1%, respectively)
(see Table 1).
Attitudes towards drug checking services
All survey respondents were asked about their attitudes
towards drug checking services. The majority of partici-
pants agreed ‘somewhat’ or ‘a lot’ that drug checking ser-
vices should be provided for free at festivals (86.2%),
with a slightly lower proportion agreeing ‘somewhat’ or
‘a lot’ that if the services were not provided for free that
it should be provided at cost (67.5%). A large proportion
of participants believed ‘somewhat’ or ‘a lot’ that drug
checking services could help users seek help to reduce
harm (86.5%) and that drug checking services should be
combined with harm reduction advice (84.9%). However,
two thirds of the participants agreed ‘somewhat’ or ‘a lot’
that drug sellers may use this service as a quality control
mechanism (68.6%). When the attitudes of those who
had used drugs in the past 12 months were compared to
those who had never used drugs (Table 2), drug users
were found to be significantly more likely to believe that
drug checking services should be provided for free (p =
0.019), could assist in drug users seeking help to reduce
harm (p = 0.019) and that the services should be com-
bined with harm reduction advice (p = 0.020).
Each question was checked for responses by gender,
with a significant difference found in the question re-
garding the provision of at-cost drug checking services,
demonstrating that a significantly higher proportion of
males (73.5%) selected ‘somewhat’ or ‘a lot’ compared
with females (64.0%) (p = 0.013). The remaining ques-
tions in this table failed to demonstrate a difference be-
tween genders.

 Attitudes, beliefs and drug checking behaviour of drug
users
Those who indicated a history of illicit drug use (n =
471) were asked additional questions about their atti-
tudes, beliefs and behaviours regarding drug use and
checking (Table 3). A significantly higher proportion of
men (61.1%) reported they were ‘highly likely’ to use a
free
drug
checking service
compared with
women
(48.0%) (p = 0.018).
Out of 172 participants who had never attempted to
find out about drug content and/or purity, 137 reported
reasons for not doing so. Qualitative analyses revealed
that the most common reasons for not attempting to
find out the content and purity of drugs included ha-
ving limited access and knowledge about drug checking
services (n = 59; 43.1%), lack of concern (n = 41; 29.9%),
the belief that drugs were from a reliable source (n =
18; 13.1%), infrequent drug use (n = 14; 10.2%) or a pri-
mary use of non-synthetic drugs such as marijuana (n
= 5; 3.6%).
Potential impact of drug checking services on drug use
Those who indicated a history of illicit drug use (n =
471) were also asked whether the results of a drug check
would influence their decision to take the drug. The ma-
jority reported that they would not take their drug if it
contained any of the chemicals mentioned in Table 4
(with the exception of ecstasy). A relatively high level of
data was missing from this question; however, no signifi-
cant
differences
were
found
between
those
who
completed the question and those who did not in terms
of age or gender.
Discussion
This study investigated the prevalence of illicit drug use
among young people attending a large Australian music
festival, their attitudes towards on-site drug checking
and the potential impact on-site drug checking would
have on drug taking behaviour. Consistent with previous
research in Australia and internationally [3, 5, 6, 27], the
results demonstrate high levels of illicit drug use among
this sample of festival attendees, with the rate of illicit drug
use being almost three times higher (73.4 vs 28.2%) among
festival attendees than in the young adult Australian po-
pulation (20- to 29-year-olds) [1].Of particular note are
the differences in the prevalence of cannabis (63.9 vs
22.1%), ecstasy (59.8 vs 7.0%) and cocaine (34.1 vs 6.9%) in
the current study compared to the Australian general
population [1]. A Danish study also reported high drug
use among festival patrons. Illicit drug use was higher than
that found in our study, with 92.8% having used cannabis
in the past year, 66.7% having used MDMA and 51.2%
having used cocaine in the past year [28].
The majority of study participants were in support of
on-site drug checking being available (both free and at
cost, 86.2 and 67.5%, respectively) and believed that it

 would help users seek help to reduce harm (84.9%). Free
drug checking services were preferred to those at cost,
especially among women. While these findings may sug-
gest that charging drug users for drug checking services
would be a barrier to access, a recent study into drug
service utilisation demonstrated that two thirds of re-
spondents were willing to pay up to $10 for a festival or
nightlife drug checking service and almost all were will-
ing to pay up to $5 [29].
Two thirds of participants believed that drug dealers
may use the service as a ‘quality control mechanism’.
Participants could have interpreted this in two ways.
First, dealers could use the service to ensure that their
product does not include unintended substances. Sec-
ond, dealers could use it to promote their product as
having a higher amount of a drug and thus being of bet-
ter quality. Therefore, it is not clear from our survey if
this is of concern to the population surveyed; however, it
has been identified as an issue elsewhere. In the USA,
this is a significant concern and is overcome by organi-
sations providing drug checking services displaying the
results of their tests as ratios, rather than quantitative
amounts [22]. Due to the amount of unmeasured and
undetectable substances in a drug, ratios cannot be
linked to quantitative amounts [22]. This allows drug
users to be informed about the possible unintended sub-
stances in their drugs but not about the quality. Simi-
larly, across many countries in Europe, procedures have
been implemented at drug checking services to ensure
pills presented by obvious drug dealers are not being
analysed, with the identification of drug dealers presum-
ably being based on multiple presentations and high vol-
umes of drugs to be tested [12].
Over a third of drug users in the sample had never
attempted to find out about the content and purity of
their drugs. A number of reasons were cited for re-
sponders not seeking further information, the most
common being limited access and knowledge regarding
availability of drug checking services. Among the two
thirds of people who had attempted to find out about
the content and purity of their drugs, only a limited
number (5.7%) had used a personal drug testing kit. This
highlights the need for further education among drug
users regarding the benefits and limitations of reagent
drug checking. When asked what methods participants
had used to attempt to find out about the content and
purity of illicit drugs, 78.6% had used friends, 36.2% had
used dealers and 35.8% had used websites. On the
contrary, Barratt and colleagues [29] found that 75% of
Australian festival and nightlife attendees who had com-
pleted a web-based survey had used friends, 63% had
used dealers and 53% had used websites.
The vast majority of respondents stated they were
somewhat or highly likely to use a drug checking service
at a festival (87.1%). This is consistent with recent re-
search [29]. Barratt et al. [29] found that 94% of people
would use drug checking service located at festivals or
clubs. This supports the theory that drug checking ser-
vices would potentially be utilised at festivals if offered.
However, Barratt and colleagues also found that that
94% would not utilise the service if there was a chance
of being arrested and two out of three also would not
use the service if they would not be provided with indi-
vidual results.
This study suggests a proportion of drug users would
alter their drug taking behaviour if drug checking re-
vealed certain unexpected or undesired substances in
their products. This is consistent with previous work in
the area, such as a review of the Austrian CheckIt! Pro-
gram which indicated that, after testing revealed an un-
expected substance, two thirds of people would not take

 their drug and would go on to warn their friends [17].
An Australian study also found that three quarters of
regular ecstasy users reported that they would not take a
pill found to contain ‘unknown substances’ [30]. The evi-
dence thus suggests that the outcomes of drug checking
has the potential to change drug use behaviour and
therefore may reduce harm among this group. However,
a number of participants in our study reported that they
‘did not know’ if they would still take a drug upon learn-
ing of unintended contents in their product (12.6–38.9%
depending on the substance). This finding highlights the
need for continued education in this area of public
health
and
the
opportunity
created
through
the
provision of drug checking services. This is evidenced by
the CheckIt! Program demonstrating higher levels of en-
gagement in education opportunities when concurrent
chemical drug analysis was being performed [17]. In-
deed, Hungerbuehler and colleagues [3] also concluded
in their study among drug checking services users in
Switzerland that drug checking in combination with a
consultation were a vital harm reduction and prevention
tool that reached a high-risk group of people who used
high doses of drugs frequently and polydrug users. Im-
portantly, the authors also acknowledged that different
prevention measures need to be tailored to local situa-
tions and different target groups.
Research has identified that current drug checking kits
are subjective and difficult to interpret [21], thus provid-
ing a precedent for testing being performed by a trained
team member, who is well versed in explaining the re-
sults. However, the risk of reagent tests not detecting
harmful substances remains.
Further research in this area include the feasibility and
practicality of using laboratory-grade testing equipment
on-site compared to reagent testing. Longitudinal re-
search investigating the long-term effects of drug check-
ing could also help to highlight the potential benefits
and risks from the health intervention and education
that a drug checking service offers.
Limitations
The results of our research are based on a convenience
sample of music festival attendees, and as such, survey
respondents are not likely to be representative of the
general population. The predominance of female respon-
dents does not correspond with national data demon-
strating that males typically consume more illicit drugs
than females [1], potentially limiting the generalisability
of this study. The high proportion of females surveyed
(60.5%) may also skew the interpretation of the results,
given the known differences in drug use prevalence be-
tween genders [1]. Testing failed to show a difference in
drug use prevalence between genders among our study
participants, but other inherent differences may exist.
Any interpretation of our results should bear in mind
the potential for gender bias.
Self-report was also a study limitation. To reduce the
likelihood of safety hazards and inaccurate reporting as-
sociated with intoxication of survey participants, surveys
were only conducted during daylight hours and partici-
pants who looked visibly intoxicated were excluded from
participation. This may lead to a sampling bias as a pro-
portion of the population of interest were excluded from
participation. Convenience sampling could also lead to
systematic bias when comparing the findings to other
populations of drug users and to the general population.
However, drug use data in our study are comparable
with other festivals [3, 5, 6, 12, 16].
Participants were asked about drug use in the last
12 months, but not about frequency of drug use, which
may have provided valuable information about a specific
subgroup of participants. Grouping once-only drug users
with frequent drug users may account for the significant
difference between drug users’ and non-drug users’ at-
titudes towards provision of drug checking services at
festivals. However, the purpose of this research was to de-
termine whether drug users would utilise drug checking
services at festivals, and as such, it is important that all
drug users are considered, regardless of frequency of use.
The missing data about drug checking services and
whether or not participants would use drugs containing
unintended substances may impact on the validity of the
findings from this particular question. A reason for this
may be that the question appeared at the end of the sur-
vey and participants may have been less likely to
complete the survey in its entirety. However, no signifi-
cant differences were found between responders and
non-responders in age and gender.
Questions relating to drug checking services and cor-
responding behavioural changes are dependent on peo-
ples’ knowledge of harmful substances, the severity of
adverse effects and people’s understanding of the accur-
acy of testing kits. Lack of knowledge may skew results
in favour of positive behavioural change.
A major strength of this study is that it is, to our
knowledge, the first large survey performed at a music
festival that measured attitudes and behaviours towards
on-site drug checking services. Reducing harm from
illicit drug use is a pertinent social issue, and our re-
search provides valuable insight into the attitudes and
behaviours of an at-risk population’s potential use of
drug checking services.
Conclusion
Drug-related harms continue to be of concern at Australian
music festivals. Drug checking services have been imple-
mented internationally as a method of harm reduction.
The majority of festival attendees reported a history of illicit

 drug use and were in favour of the provision of both free
and at-cost drug checking at festivals. Drug users stated
that they would utilise free on-site drug checking services
and that the results of these tests would influence their
drug-taking behaviours. This has the potential ability to
directly minimise harm from ingestion of unintended
toxic substances. The findings of this study can contrib-
ute to the current debate in Australia regarding whether
drug checking services could play a role in harm reduction
and health promotion programming for young people at-
tending festivals.
