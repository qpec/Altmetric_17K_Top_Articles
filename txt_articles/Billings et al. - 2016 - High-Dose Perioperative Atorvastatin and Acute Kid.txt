IMPORTANCE Statins affect several mechanisms underlying acute kidney injury (AKI).
OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that short-term high-dose perioperative atorvastatin
would reduce AKI following cardiac surgery.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized
clinical trial of adult cardiac surgery patients conducted from November 2009 to October
2014 at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
INTERVENTIONS Patients naive to statin treatment (n = 199) were randomly assigned 80 mg
of atorvastatin the day before surgery, 40 mg of atorvastatin the morning of surgery, and
40 mg of atorvastatin daily following surgery (n = 102) or matching placebo (n = 97). Patients
already taking a statin prior to study enrollment (n = 416) continued taking the preenrollment
statin until the day of surgery, were randomly assigned 80 mg of atorvastatin the morning of
surgery and 40 mg of atorvastatin the morning after (n = 206) or matching placebo
(n = 210), and resumed taking the previously prescribed statin on postoperative day 2.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Acutekidneyinjurydefinedasanincreaseof0.3mg/dLin
serumcreatinineconcentrationwithin48hoursofsurgery(AcuteKidneyInjuryNetworkcriteria).
RESULTS The data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping the group naive to
statin treatment due to increased AKI among these participants with chronic kidney disease
(estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) receiving atorvastatin. The board
later recommended stopping for futility after 615 participants (median age, 67 years; 188
[30.6%] were women; 202 [32.8%] had diabetes) completed the study. Among all
participants (n = 615), AKI occurred in 64 of 308 (20.8%) in the atorvastatin group vs 60 of
307 (19.5%) in the placebo group (relative risk [RR], 1.06 [95% CI, 0.78 to 1.46]; P = .75).
Among patients naive to statin treatment (n = 199), AKI occurred in 22 of 102 (21.6%) in the
atorvastatin group vs 13 of 97 (13.4%) in the placebo group (RR, 1.61 [0.86 to 3.01]; P = .15)
and serum creatinine concentration increased by a median of 0.11 mg/dL (10th-90th
percentile, −0.11 to 0.56 mg/dL) in the atorvastatin group vs by a median of 0.05 mg/dL
(10th-90th percentile, −0.12 to 0.33 mg/dL) in the placebo group (mean difference, 0.08
mg/dL [95% CI, 0.01 to 0.15 mg/dL]; P = .007). Among patients already taking a statin
(n = 416), AKI occurred in 42 of 206 (20.4%) in the atorvastatin group vs 47 of 210 (22.4%) in
the placebo group (RR, 0.91 [0.63 to 1.32]; P = .63).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients undergoing cardiac surgery, high-dose
perioperative atorvastatin treatment compared with placebo did not reduce the risk
of AKI overall, among patients naive to treatment with statins, or in patients already taking a
statin. These results do not support the initiation of statin therapy to prevent AKI following
cardiac surgery.

A
cutekidneyinjury(AKI)complicatesrecoveryfromcar-
diac surgery in up to 30% of patients.1 Surgical, anes-
thetic, and critical care advancements have reduced
perioperative mortality but have not reduced the incidence of
AKI, and some studies have reported increasing rates of post-
operative dialysis.2-4 Recent large cohort studies confirm that
even mild postoperative AKI is independently associated with
a 5-fold increase in death while in the hospital.5 A diagnosis
ofAKIfollowingcardiacsurgeryisaccompaniedbyhigherrates
of postoperative arrhythmias, respiratory failure, systemic in-
fection, and myocardial infarction.1,5-7 Treatments are needed
to reduce this debilitating postoperative outcome.
Statins affect several mechanisms underlying postopera-
tive AKI, and statin treatment may affect AKI in patients fol-
lowing cardiac surgery. In a recent observational study of
17 000 patients who underwent cardiac surgery, investigators
reported a 22% relative risk (RR) reduction in AKI associated
with preoperative statin treatment in adjusted analyses,8
whereas investigators of a similar study of 11 000 patients
observed no effect.9 These observational studies that com-
pared patients who are taking statins with those who are not
taking statins did not adequately test the hypothesis that pre-
operative, intraoperative, and early postoperative (periopera-
tive) statin treatment reduces AKI. It is both unclear if de
novo initiation of perioperative statin treatment in patients
naive to statins affects AKI, or if statin continuation or peri-
operative withdrawal in patients already taking statin treat-
ment affects AKI.
We performed the Statin AKI Cardiac Surgery [random-
ized clinical trial] RCT to test the hypothesis that short-term
high-doseperioperativeatorvastatinreducesAKIfollowingcar-
diac surgery.
Methods
Study Design and Patients
The Statin AKI Cardiac Surgery RCT was an investigator-
initiated, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study con-
ducted to test the hypothesis that short-term, high-dose
perioperative atorvastatin treatment reduces AKI following
cardiac surgery (the Trial Protocol appears in Supplement 1).
Adult patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass
grafting, valvular heart surgery, or ascending aortic surgery at
Vanderbilt University Medical Center were eligible for study
participation (Figure 1).
Patients were excluded if they had (1) prior statin intol-
erance; (2) acute coronary syndrome (defined as ST or
non-ST elevation myocardial infarction with elevated serum
troponin concentrations); (3) liver dysfunction (defined as
serum transaminase concentrations >3 times the upper limit
of normal [120 U/L], a bilirubin concentration >3 mg/dL, or a
diagnosis of cirrhosis); (4) current use of potent CYP3A4
inhibitors, including azole antifungals, protease inhibitors,
and macrolide antibiotics; (5) current use of cyclosporine;
(6) current use of renal replacement therapy; (7) a history of
kidney transplant; (8) required emergency or urgent sur-
gery; or (9) were pregnant.
The study was approved by the Vanderbilt University
Institutional Review Board for Research on Human Sub-
jects and conducted according to the Declaration of
Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent.
Anesthetic, surgical, and postoperative management were
conducted according to institutional protocols (eMethods in
Supplement 2).
Intervention
Patients naive to statin treatment were randomized to
receive 80 mg of atorvastatin the day prior to surgery, 40 mg
of atorvastatin the morning of surgery (at least 3 hours prior
to surgery), and 40 mg of atorvastatin daily at 10 AM follow-
ing surgery for the duration of hospitalization or to a match-
ing placebo regimen. Patients already taking a statin were
randomized to receive the study drug only on days they oth-
erwise would have not been prescribed a statin under stan-
dard of care because it was deemed unethical to randomize
these patients to placebo throughout the perioperative
period based on prior observational studies and clinical trials
in similar patient populations demonstrating that statin
withdrawal may increase AKI.10-13 Therefore, patients
already taking a statin continued taking their preenrollment
statin until the day of surgery and resumed taking their pre-
viously prescribed statin on postoperative day 2. On the
day of surgery, patients were randomly assigned to 80 mg of
atorvastatin at least 3 hours prior to surgery and 40 mg
of atorvastatin the day after surgery at 10 AM or to a match-
ing placebo regimen.
Statin administration subsequent to study intervention
(starting at hospital discharge in patients naive to statin treat-
ment and starting on postoperative day 2 in patients already
taking a statin) was at the discretion of the treating physician.
The intervention both in patients naive to statin treatment
and in those already taking a statin was designed to be prag-
matic, lending itself to maximum generalizability for subse-
quent patients undergoing cardiac surgery. We chose atorva-
statin because short-term periprocedural atorvastatin
treatment has been reported in studies to reduce arrhythmia
following cardiac surgery and myocardial injury following
percutaneous coronary intervention.14,15 The loading dose of
80 mg and maintenance dose of 40 mg of atorvastatin were
chosen to maximize potential benefit, to limit toxicity, and to
fall within recommended daily dosing.
Participants were randomized in permuted block sizes
of 2 or 4 to receive oral atorvastatin or matching placebo
within strata defined by prior statin use, by the presence of
chronic kidney disease (CKD; defined as a glomerular filtra-
tion rate of <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, estimated using the modi-
fication of diet in renal disease formula), and by a history of
diabetes. The Vanderbilt University Medical Center Investi-
gation Drug Service compounded and maintained atorva-
statin and placebo capsules identical in size, color, texture,
weight, and taste. Using a randomization schedule provided
by the study statistician, the Investigation Drug Service
assigned the intervention to recruited patients, dispensed
atorvastatin or matching placebo, and logged treatment
assignment in private records. Investigators, clinicians,

patients, and research personnel were blinded to treatment
for the duration of the study.
Outpatient adherence to the intervention was monitored
by directly questioning patients and family members on the
morning of surgery, and adherence while patients were in the
hospital was monitored by reviewing the electronic medica-
tion administration record. For intubated patients unable to
swallow pills, the study drug was mixed with water and ad-
ministered via oral gastric tube.
Study Outcomes
The primary end point was the diagnosis of AKI according to
criteria from the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN),16 spe-
cifically an increase of 0.3 mg/dL in serum creatinine con-
centration (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4) or the
initiation of renal replacement therapy within 48 hours of
surgery. Stage 1 AKI was defined as an increase of 0.3 mg/dL
in serum creatinine or 50%; stage 2, a 100% increase; and
stage 3, a 200% increase or initiation of renal replacement
therapy. Baseline creatinine concentration was defined as
the most recent creatinine measurement prior to surgery,
and serum creatinine concentration was measured in all
inpatients on the morning of surgery and no more than 7
days prior to surgery in outpatients. Postoperatively, serum
creatinine concentration was measured at 2 AM daily
throughout the duration of hospitalization. All creatinine

measurements were performed in the Vanderbilt University
Medical Center clinical laboratory.
Secondary end points included the maximum increase in
creatinine concentration from baseline to 48 hours following
surgery (postoperative day 2), the incidence and duration of
delirium while in the intensive care unit (ICU) (incorrectly
noted as a co-primary end point during the editing of the study
registration), the degree of myocardial injury, and the inci-
denceofpostoperativeatrialfibrillation,pneumonia,orstroke.
Studypersonnelassessedfordeliriumonceinthemorningand
once in the afternoon while patients were in the ICU using the
Richmond agitation and sedation scale and the confusion as-
sessment method for the ICU.17
We quantified myocardial injury by measuring serum
creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) concentrations on postoperative
day 1 in the clinical laboratory. Atrial fibrillation was diag-
nosed by the patient’
s physician and confirmed by research
personnel using electrocardiograms and rhythm strips. We
defined pneumonia as a positive sputum culture or postop-
erative pulmonary infiltrate with systemic signs of infection
(temperature >38.6°C or white blood cell count >12.0 × 109/L)
and the use of parenteral antibiotics or documentation of the
diagnosis by the patient’
s physician. Stroke was defined as
any new deficit during the neurological examination and
confirmed with radiological evidence. Additional secondary
end points were duration of postoperative mechanical venti-
lation, duration of ICU stay, and incidence of death during
hospitalization.
Safety Evaluation
Safety outcomes included acute liver toxicity assessed by
measuring serum aspartate aminotransferase concentration
on postoperative day 1, acute muscle toxicity assessed by
questioning participants daily for myalgias and measuring
serum creatine kinase concentration on postoperative day 1,
and adverse events. Adverse events were defined as any
untoward medical occurrence in a participant and included
postoperative fever, tachycardia, hypotension, vasoplegia,
decreased cardiac output, anemia, leukocytosis, and lactic
acidosis (specific diagnostic criteria appear in the eMethods
in Supplement 2).
The data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) reviewed
patient recruitment practices, safety reporting, and data
quality after 30 patients completed the study; performed an
interim analysis after 277 patients (the first third of planned
enrollment) had completed the study to assess safety of the
intervention; and performed a second interim analysis
after 546 patients (the second third of planned enrollment)
had completed the study to assess the safety, efficacy, and
futility of the intervention. The DSMB made recommenda-
tions based on qualitative assessments of the safety, effi-
cacy, and futility of the intervention (details appear in
Supplement 2).
In October 2012, the DSMB recommended study continu-
ation after the first planned interim analysis. In August 2014,
following the second interim analysis, the DSMB recom-
mended discontinuation of the recruitment of patients naive
to statin treatment due to evidence of increased risk of AKI in
patients randomized to atorvastatin, particularly in patients
with preexisting CKD. Following a conditional power analy-
sis for patients already taking a statin that assumed the true
treatment effect would be consistent with what had been ob-
served in those who had completed the study, the DSMB rec-
ommended in October 2014 discontinuation of the recruit-
ment of patients already taking a statin due to futility on the
primary end point.
Baseline Characteristics and Other Patient Data
Demographic, medical history, hemodynamic, anesthetic,
surgical, cardiopulmonary bypass, transfusion, medication
exposure, ICU, and laboratory data were collected on all
patients. Race and ethnicity data were determined by
patient self-reporting and were collected because African
American ancestry is associated with AKI. In addition to
safety and clinical care laboratory measurements, a lipid
panel was assessed prior to surgery. To assess baseline men-
tal competence, all participants were administered a Mini-
Mental State Examination and a Trails B test prior to surgery
by research personnel.
Statistical Analysis
The analysis was completed according to the statistical analy-
sis plan (details appear in Supplement 2). We planned to
study 820 patients to detect a 30% RR reduction of AKI
between treatment groups with an assumed AKI incidence of
27.6% in the placebo group,12 a type I error probability of
0.05, and 80% power. We summarized demographics,
patient characteristics, and safety and efficacy end points
with the 50th (10th-90th) percentiles for continuous vari-
ables and with percentages for categorical variables. We used
the Pearson χ2 test and the Wilcoxon rank sum test to com-
pare the randomized treatment groups regarding categorical
and continuous outcomes, respectively.
To estimate treatment effects, we used Quasi-Poisson log-
linear regression for binary outcomes with event rates greater
than 10% due to ease of interpretation of RRs and because we
designed the study to detect a RR reduction, logistic regres-
sion for rare binary outcomes due to model stability with event
rates less than 10% and close approximation of the odds ratio
with the RR for rare outcomes,18,19 proportional odds regres-
sion for ordered categorical and highly skewed outcomes
(eg, duration of delirium and ICU stay), and linear regression
for continuous outcomes.
The CK-MB, time to extubation, creatine kinase, and
aspartate aminotransferase outcomes were log-transformed
to improve model fit. In the Tables, we include absolute dif-
ferences between treatment groups derived from model
transformations. For dichotomous outcomes, the absolute
differences are the estimated differences in proportions
between the statin and placebo groups. For continuous out-
comes, the absolute differences are the estimated differences
in the geometric means between the statin and placebo
groups. For the duration outcomes of delirium in the ICU and
ICU stay, the absolute differences are the differences in the
proportions of those in the statin group greater than the
median value in the placebo group minus 0.5 (ie, the propor-

tion of those in the placebo greater than the median value in
the placebo group).
Several subgroup analyses were planned prior to initiat-
ing the study because treatment effects could vary based on
preexisting statin use and baseline kidney disease. These
groups included patients (1) who were naive to statin treat-
ment, (2) who were already taking a statin, (3) who had
CKD, (4) who were naive to statin treatment and had CKD,
and (5) who were already taking a statin and had CKD. The
primary unadjusted analyses are presented herein. The pro-
pensity score–adjusted analyses and treatment-received
analyses appear in the eResults in Supplement 2.
TheanalyseswereperformedusingRversion3.1.2(RFoun-
dation for Statistical Computing), and a 2-sided significance
level of .05 was required to achieve statistical significance.
Results
Patient Recruitment, Randomization,
Baseline Characteristics, and Protocol Adherence
Between November 2009 and October 2014, 4466 adult
patients presented for coronary bypass, valve, or ascending
aorta surgery (Figure 1). Ten percent of these patients
had acute coronary syndrome, 3.7% end stage renal dis-
ease, 3.1% liver dysfunction, 2.6% were allergic to statins,
and 5.5% required emergent or urgent surgery. Of those
approached for study participation, approximately 30% did
not provide consent. We recruited 653 patients. Twenty-two
were subsequently excluded from study and 14 withdrew
consent prior to randomization.
One patient withdrew consent following randomization
prior to receiving treatment, and 1 patient was withdrawn
from the study on the day of surgery by his intensivist.
Therefore, 615 patients (199 naive to statin treatment and
416 already taking a statin) were included in the primary
analysis; 308 were randomized to atorvastatin and 307 to
placebo. Patient characteristics were well balanced between
the treatment groups (Table 1). The median patient age was
67 years, 30.6% were women, and 32.8% had diabetes.
Coronary artery bypass grafting was performed in half of
the patients, and two-thirds of patients received valve sur-
gery. Compared with patients in the placebo group, mean
serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations at
induction of anesthesia (following treatment initiation but
before surgery) were lower by 8.1 mg/dL (95% CI, 2.2-14.1
mg/dL) in the atorvastatin group (P = .01).
Treatment adherence (ie, received all protocol-directed
doses) was achieved in 2356 of 2400 (98.2%) total doses of
study drug. Of 199 patients naive to statin treatment, 180
(90.5%) received all protocol-directed doses. Of 416 patients
already taking a statin, 391 (94.0%) received all protocol-
directed doses (Supplement 2).
Analyses of AKI and Serum Creatinine Concentration
Among all patients (n = 615), the primary end point of AKI
(by AKIN criteria) occurred in 64 of 308 (20.8%) in the ator-
vastatin group compared with 60 of 307 (19.5%) in the pla-
cebo group (P = .75 by Pearson χ2). Perioperative atorva-
statin treatment did not affect risk for AKI in the total
cohort (RR, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.78 to 1.46]; Figure 2) or peri-
operative serum creatinine concentrations. Median serum
creatinine concentrations increased by 0.07 mg/dL (10th-
90th percentile, −0.13 to 0.51 mg/dL) within the first 48
postoperative hours among participants in the atorvastatin
group compared with 0.07 mg/dL (10th-90th percentile,
−0.12 to 0.52 mg/dL) in the placebo group (mean difference,
−0.01 mg/dL [95% CI, −0.06 to 0.04 mg/dL]; P = .89).
Among patients naive to statin treatment (n = 199), AKI
occurred in 22 of 102 (21.6%) in the atorvastatin group com-
pared with 13 of 97 (13.4%) in the placebo group (RR, 1.61
[95% CI, 0.86 to 3.01]; P = .15) and median serum creatinine
concentrations within the first 48 postoperative hours
increased by 0.11 mg/dL (10th-90th percentile, −0.11 to
0.56 mg/dL) in the atorvastatin group compared with
0.05 mg/dL (10th-90th percentile, −0.12 to 0.33 mg/dL) in
the placebo group (mean difference, 0.08 mg/dL [95% CI,
0.01 to 0.15 mg/dL]; P = .007).
Among patients already taking a statin (n = 416), high-
dose perioperative atorvastatin or short-term statin with-
drawal did not affect AKI risk. Acute kidney injury occurred
in 42 of 206 patients already taking a statin (20.4%) in the
atorvastatin group compared with 47 of 210 patients
(22.4%) in the placebo group (RR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.63-1.32];
P = .63); postoperative changes in serum creatinine concen-
tration were not different between groups.
In the baseline CKD subgroup (179 of 615 patients), the in-
cidence of AKI was also similar between treatment groups.
Thirtyofthe84participantswithCKDintheatorvastatingroup
(35.7%) developed AKI and 31 of the 95 participants with CKD
in the placebo group (32.6%) developed AKI (RR, 1.09 [95% CI,
0.73 to 1.65]; P = .76).
In the subgroup of patients with CKD and naive to statin
treatment (n = 36), AKI occurred in 9 of 17 (52.9%) in the
atorvastatin group compared with 3 of 19 (15.8%) in the pla-
cebo group (RR, 3.35 [95% CI, 1.12 to 10.05]; P = .03). In this
subgroup, postoperative serum creatinine concentrations
increased by a median of 0.26 mg/dL (10th-90th percentile,
−0.22 to 0.94 mg/dL) within the first 48 postoperative
hours in patients in the atorvastatin group compared with a
decrease of 0.06 mg/dL (10th-90th percentile, decrease of
0.16 mg/dL to increase of 0.41 mg/dL) in the placebo group
(mean difference, 0.28 mg/dL [95% CI, 0.02 to 0.54 mg/dL];
P = .04).
Among the subgroup of patients with CKD who were
already taking a statin (n = 143), AKI occurred in 21 of 67
(31.3%) in the atorvastatin group compared with 28 of 76
(36.8%) in the placebo group (RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.54 to
1.35]; P = .59). In this subgroup, postoperative changes in
serum creatinine concentration were not different between
treatment groups.
In the total cohort, AKI required dialysis in 5 of the 308
patients (1.6%) in the atorvastatin group compared with 3
of the 307 (1.0%) patients in the placebo group (P = .71). Of
the 124 cases of AKI in the study, 106 (85.4%) were stage 1;
6 (4.8%), stage 2; and 12 (9.7%), stage 3. There was no

stroke (Table 2 and Table 3). The incidence of postoperative
pneumonia was numerically lower but not significantly dif-
ferent in patients randomized to atorvastatin. This result
should be interpreted with caution based on multiple com-
parisons for secondary end points and risk of type I error.
Allbut1ofthe17strokeswasischemicinnatureratherthan
hemorrhagic. Length of stay in the ICU and all-cause in-
hospital mortality were not significantly different between
treatment groups.
Propensity-adjusted analyses yielded results that were
largelyconsistentwiththeintention-to-treatunadjustedanaly-
ses, although the evidence of harm from atorvastatin treat-
ment in the patients naive to statin treatment with preexist-
ing CKD was attenuated (eTable 1 in Supplement 2).
Safety End Points
There was no evidence to suggest that perioperative high-
dose atorvastatin treatment increased skeletal muscle or
hepatic markers of statin toxicity. Six patients (1.9%) in the
atorvastatin group reported proximal muscle myalgias on
postoperative day 1, 2, or 3 compared with 5 patients (1.6%)
in the placebo group (P = .77, Table 4). Postoperative day 1
concentrations of creatine kinase and aspartate aminotrans-
ferase were also not increased by high-dose short-term peri-
operative atorvastatin treatment, nor were adverse events
(details of adverse events appear in Supplement 2).
Discussion
This double-blinded, placebo-controlled RCT found no evi-
dence that high-dose perioperative atorvastatin reduces the
incidence or severity of AKI following cardiac surgery. Among
patientsnaivetostatintreatment,high-doseperioperativeator-
vastatin increased serum concentrations of creatinine, and
there was some evidence that statin treatment may increase
AKI among patients naive to statin treatment with preexist-
ing CKD. Among patients already taking a statin, there was no
evidence that perioperative statin continuation or with-
drawal affected postoperative AKI. The results from the pre-
specified secondary end points of delirium, myocardial in-
jury, atrial fibrillation, and stroke were similar between
randomized treatment groups.
Based on preclinical studies of statin mechanisms and ob-
servational studies of cardiac surgery cohorts, statin treat-
ment is an attractive therapy to reduce AKI following cardiac
surgery. Short-term statin treatment has been shown to limit
vascular superoxide generation,20,21 reduce endothelial dys-
function by restoring endothelial-derived nitric oxide syn-
thase activity during hypoxia,22 and attenuate lymphocyte
activation.23 These effects decrease inflammation, endothe-
lial dysfunction, and oxidant stress, mechanisms implicated
in AKI development.24 In a study of patients undergoing car-
diac surgery, 3 weeks of treatment with a 20-mg/d dose of ator-
vastatinreducedpeakplasmaIL-6andIL-8concentrationsand
neutrophil adhesion.25
Prior studies of statins to reduce AKI following cardiac sur-
gery are limited to a pilot study and numerous observational
reports. Prowle et al26 randomized 100 patients who under-
went cardiac surgery to 4 days of atorvastatin (40 mg) or pla-
cebo starting the day prior to surgery and compared in-
creases in serum creatinine concentrations from baseline to
postoperative day 5. This study26 found no difference in cre-
atinine concentration and a marginal but insignificant reduc-
tion in AKI rates defined by risk, injury, failure, loss of kidney
function,andend-stagekidneydisease(RIFLEcriteria27)inpa-
tients randomized to atorvastatin.
The majority of observational studies compare patients
who are taking statins prior to surgery with patients not tak-
ing statins prior to surgery. The association between preop-
erative statin use and postoperative AKI is inconsistent, pos-
sibly due to selection bias for statin use, variable effects of
treatment, and disparate patient populations. Some of these
studies reported a lower incidence of AKI among patients
taking statins preoperatively,8,28-30 whereas others reported
no differences between patients taking statins and those not
taking statins.9,31-34 Few studies have reported statin expo-
sure during the entire perioperative period (ie, the day prior
to surgery, day of surgery, and the first 2 days after), a period
when acute inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and oxi-
dant injury surge, and therefore a potential therapeutic win-
dow for preventing AKI.

Absolute differences are the estimated differences in proportions between the
atorvastatin and placebo groups derived from model transformations.
Quasi-Poisson log-linear regression was used to calculate the estimates and
95% CIs. The estimates should be interpreted as the relative risk of treatment
for the primary end point of AKI. The Pearson χ2 test was used to calculate
the P values.

Contrary to our hypothesis, de novo initiation of daily
perioperative atorvastatin treatment did not reduce the
incidence of AKI or reduce the increase in serum creatinine
concentration associated with cardiac surgery. On the con-
trary, initiation of high-dose atorvastatin in patients naive
to statin treatment increased serum creatinine concentra-
tion more from baseline to postoperative day 2 than initia-
tion of placebo. Among patients with CKD and naive to
statin treatment, there was evidence that statin treatment
may increase AKI. Limitations to this finding are (1) the
small number of patients in the subgroup with CKD and
naive to statin treatment, (2) the wide confidence interval,
and (3) the loss of statistical significance in the propensity
score–adjusted model.
The mechanism of any deleterious effects is unclear.
The kidneys eliminate less than 1% of atorvastatin,35 so any
renal toxic effect is unlikely to be related to increased circu-
lating atorvastatin in patients with CKD. Because patients
with CKD are at high risk for AKI,2 any injurious mechanism
of de novo atorvastatin initiation may be magnified in these
patients. A harmful effect of de novo statin treatment on
renal function has been previously reported in a different
critically ill patient population. The Acute Respiratory Dis-
tress Syndrome Network reported that patients randomized

to daily rosuvastatin after being admitted to the ICU with
acute respiratory distress syndrome experienced increased
renal failure compared with patients randomized to
placebo.36 Eighty-five percent of these patients were naive
to statin treatment.
Most patients presenting for cardiac surgery, however, are
already taking statins, and in the current study there was little
evidence that continuation or withdrawal from statin treat-
ment on the day of surgery and postoperative day 1 affects AKI.
The 2-day duration of treatment for patients already taking a
statin could be a limitation to this finding, but this treatment
duration is consistent with the opportunity for intervention
incurrentclinicalpractice.Wedeemedalongerperiodofstatin
withdrawalunethicalbasedonreportsthatperioperativestatin
withdrawal for periods as short as 1 to 2 days correlates with
increased risk of AKI following cardiac or vascular surgery, the
observation that 40% of patients already taking a statin re-
sume statin use within 1 day of cardiac surgery, and a clinical
trial in patients already taking a statin and undergoing percu-
taneous coronary intervention that demonstrated placebo ad-
ministration on the day of intervention increases myocardial
injury compared with atorvastatin (statin continuation)
treatment.10-13 Therefore, to limit risk in patients already tak-
ing a statin randomized to placebo, we did not reduce statin
exposure compared with usual care. Also in keeping with the
pragmatic nature of the trial, we did not initiate a preopera-
tive treatment in patients naive to statin treatment multiple
days or weeks before surgery because many patients receive
surgerysoonafterconsultationwiththeirsurgeon.Wedeemed
it impractical to require patients to return 1 year after sur-
gery;therefore,theeffectoftreatmentonlong-termrenalfunc-
tion is unknown.
We acknowledge other limitations. This was not a multi-
centerstudy.WediagnosedAKIusingAKINcriteria,16buturine
output AKIN criteria were not used, and AKIN criteria are in-
sensitive to AKI that develops late during the postoperative pe-
riod. The statistical significance for the deleterious effect of
treatment on the primary end point in the subgroup with CKD
and naive to statin treatment was lost in the secondary pro-
pensity score–adjusted analysis, possibly as a result of type I
error or lack of power in this subgroup, and the cohort as a
whole was at low risk for more severe clinical outcomes such
as stage 2 or 3 AKI, which have been more closely associated
with long-term outcomes.
Conclusions
Among patients undergoing cardiac surgery, high-dose peri-
operative atorvastatin treatment compared with placebo did
notreducetheriskofAKIoverall,amongpatientsnaivetotreat-
ment with statins, or in patients already taking a statin. These
results do not support the initiation of statin therapy to pre-
vent AKI following cardiac surgery.
