Exposure to thirdhand smoke (THS) is a recently described health concern that arises in
many indoor environments. However, the carcinogenic potential of THS, a critical consider-
ation in risk assessment, remains untested. Here we investigated the effects of short-term
early exposure to THS on lung carcinogenesis in A/J mice. Forty weeks after THS exposure
from 4 to 7 weeks of age, the mice had increased incidence of lung adenocarcinoma, tumor
size and, multiplicity, compared with controls. In vitro studies using cultured human lung
cancer cells showed that THS exposure induced DNA double-strand breaks and increased
cell proliferation and colony formation. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that THS expo-
sure induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and activated p53 signaling. Activation of the
p53 pathway was confirmed by an increase in its targets p21 and BAX. These data indicate
that early exposure to THS is associated with increased lung cancer risk.
Introduction
Cigarette smoke, including both mainstream and secondhand smoke (SHS), is a rich source of mutagens
and carcinogens such as N-nitrosamines, aromatic amines, aldehydes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs), and others [1-3]. Active smoking and SHS exposure both cause lung cancer [4-6]. SHS is produced
by the combination of diluted sidestream smoke (emitted by a burning tobacco product) and exhaled
mainstream smoke. It is very likely that the general mechanisms underlying lung cancer development
by mainstream smoke and SHS are similar because the same carcinogens are found in both, albeit the
carcinogen dose from SHS exposure is significantly lower than that from mainstream smoking [4].
Recently a new type of tobacco exposure, referred to as ‘
thirdhand smoke’(THS), has been identified.
THS is defined as the pollutants that remain on indoor surfaces and in dust long after tobacco has been
smoked [7,8]. Some of the adsorbed constituents can be re-emitted into the gas-phase and/or react with
other pollutants to form more hazardous compounds. THS-exposed dust can also be re-suspended into
the air. Fieldwork in the U.S. and China confirms the widespread presence of THS in indoor environ-
ments [8,9]. THS exposure occurs through the involuntary inhalation, ingestion or dermal uptake of aged
residues from SHS. However, the timescale for exposure to THS pollution is generally much longer than
for SHS, and could stretch to days, months or even years (long-term, low-level exposure). Traditional
cleaning methods cannot remove THS pollution effectively.

Studies in recent years have also shown that THS contains many types of toxic constituents, including volatile
(VOCs) and semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) that slowly reemit into the air, thus increasing expo-
sure risk for nonsmokers [7,8,10]. Some of the chemical constituents identified in THS are known carcinogens
that are the same as those present in the mainstream smoke and SHS such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocar-
bons (PAHs) and TSNAs (tobacco specific nitrosamines). Through an analysis of unpublished results from Philip
Morris, Schick and Glantz reported that SHS can become more toxic and concentrations of carcinogenic TSNAs
can increase over time [11]. Sleiman et al. later showed that nicotine, a main constituent of tobacco smoke, re-
acts with ozone (O3) to yield aldehydes and nanoparticles [12] and with nitrous acid (HONO) to form several
TSNAs, including 1-(N-methyl-N-nitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridinyl)-4-butanal (NNA), N-nitroso nornicotine (NNN)
and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridinyl)-1-butanone (NNK) [13]. The extent of surface loading of TSNAs was
estimated to be large enough to warrant investigation of health effects of exposure to THS [13]. Recent data from
Schick and Glantz show that the majority of nicotine, cotinine, semi-volatile organics, PAHs and TSNAs that are re-
leased during smoking in buildings adsorb or deposit on room surfaces. As long as there are sources of the indoor
pollutant HONO, reaction with adsorbed nicotine forms more TSNAs. These findings suggest that exposure to toxic
and carcinogenic compounds such as PAHs and TSNAs in THS may contribute to smoking-attributable morbidity
and mortality [14] through dermal absorption and inhalation of contaminated dust.
Compelling evidence now shows how THS and its specific constituents such as TSNAs can cause significant cellular
and tissue changes at realistic doses. Exposure to THS generated in laboratory systems can cause significant DNA
damage in human cell lines [15], higher levels of oxidative base lesions in skin wounds of mice [16], damage to
multiple organs and alterations in body weight, immunity, and behavior in mice [17,18]. Exposure to THS at very low
concentrations also caused distinct metabolic changes in mouse male reproductive cell lines [19]. It is well understood
that the environmental pollutants that play key roles in the etiology of human cancer include chemical carcinogens,
such as those in cigarette smoke. However, at present there is no direct evidence on the role of THS exposure in the
development of tumors in animals and/or humans.
Compared with adults, small children face greater health risks from THS exposure because they typically spend
more time indoors and have age-specific behaviors that bring them in close contact with surfaces and dust (i.e., crawl-
ing, mouthing, and/or ingesting non-food items). Moreover, children are more sensitive than adults to pollutants for
several reasons: increased respiration rate/body size, larger exposed surface area/volume ratio, thinner skin, imma-
turity of immunologic systems, and low metabolic capacity. Thus even low doses of THS constituents may represent
long-term health hazards to them [7,8]. Matt et al. reported that the homes of parents who only smoked outdoors
still had higher levels of nicotine than the homes of nonsmokers, and more importantly, the children of parents who
never smoked inside their home had higher urinary cotinine levels than the children of nonsmokers [20]. Even in
places where smoking bans are strictly enforced, such as neonatal intensive care units in hospitals, THS can be found
by measuring ratios of concentrations of (4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol) (NNAL) to cotinine in
infants’urine [21]. By analyzing nicotine and nitrosamines/TSNAs in house dust samples, Ramirez et al. found that
exposure to nitrosamines increases cancer risk in non-smokers [22]. We recently investigated the effects of neonatal
and adult THS exposure on bodyweight and blood cell populations in C57BL/6J mice and found that THS-treated
mice had significantly lower bodyweight than their respective control mice in the neonatal period [18]. Although
these results suggest that THS is a potential health threat to infants and young children, virtually nothing is known
about the long-term effects of early-life THS exposure on cancer risk later in life.
The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that short-term early exposure to THS increases the incidence
of lung adenocarcinoma in A/J mice later in life, and to delineate the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie
THS-induced tumorigenicity.
Materials and methods
THS sample preparation and characterization
For testing THS carcinogenicity in animals and other cellular experiments using cell lines, a controlled laboratory
system was used to generate THS samples on cotton terry cloth, an approach developed in our previous work [15].
The cloth substrates were used as surrogates for indoor surfaces, onto which fresh SHS gases could adsorb and SHS
particles deposit. Briefly, Clean 100% cotton terrycloth samples were repeatedly exposed to SHS in a 6-m3 stainless
steel chamber for a total of 234 h over 1019 days. During smoking, a total of 2795 mg of total particulate material
was introduced into the steel chamber. This is equivalent to the smoke from 200 to 350 cigarettes over 2 years and 9
months, or approximately 1/5–1/3 of a cigarette per day. If all THS mass deposited on the surfaces of the exposure

chamber, the maximum loading of THS on each gram of cotton cloth would be 238 μg. The THS cloth was removed
from the smoke, vacuum-packed in Mylar film and stored at −20◦C until use.
Preparation of THS extracts
For chemical analysis and cell culture, THS-laden and unexposed (control) cotton cloth samples were weighed, cut
into small pieces and immersed in Dulbecco’
s Modified Eagle’
s Medium (DMEM) using 0.85 g cloth material per
10 ml of medium, then vortexed and centrifuged as previously described [15]. One ml of media with THS and an-
other without (control) were taken out and stored at 4◦C until use. A collection of 12 targeted THS compounds
in the DMEM samples was analyzed following the procedures described in the previous study [15], using liquid
chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) as described in Whitehead et al. [23]. For PAHs anal-
ysis, 2.5 x 5 cm specimens of the THS-impregnated and unexposed (control) cloth samples were extracted with
dichloromethane (DCM) by sonication for 30 min. Specimens were pre-spiked with a known amount of deuter-
ated PAH standards (naphthalene-D8, phenanthrene-D10, anthracene-D10, pyrene-D10, and benzo[e]pyrene-D12)
to assess recovery efficiency. Extraction was carried out using two identical 15 ml DCM aliquots sequentially. These
extracts were analyzed separately to evaluate extraction efficiency. Duplicate DCM extracts were analyzed by gas chro-
matography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS, Varian 4000, CA), using mixtures of PAH as quantification
standards.
Mice exposed to THS and tumorigenesis
All animal experiments were performed at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the study was carried out
in strict accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.
The animal use protocol was approved by the Animal Welfare and Research Committee of the Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory.
A/J mice were divided into experimental (24 mice) and control (19 mice) groups, with 4 mice per cage. The exper-
imental group was exposed to THS from 4 to 7 weeks of age; the control group was never exposed to THS. All mice
were fed a standard chow diet (with caloric content of: 58% carbohydrate, 28.5% protein, and 13.5% fat). THS-exposed
cloth was added to the standard bedding in the cages, and the cloth swatches were replaced once a week during the
standard cage change. The cloth was the sole source of THS exposure. And only after the exposure period was the
bedding switched back to the standard. There was 0.85 g (5×5 cm2 swatch) of THS-exposed cloth per cage, with a
nicotine loading of 30.6 μg/g and an upper limit for THS deposition of 238 μg/g (Table 1). Assuming that the uptake
of nicotine through ingestion, inhalation, and dermal routes was quantitative, the predicted dose was 77 μg/day kg
of bodyweight. This value is comparable to the ingestion exposure of a toddler estimated by Bahl et al. [24]. Control
animals were housed separately on standard bedding. Lung tumor incidence, size, and multiplicity were determined
40 weeks after THS exposure. All tumors were embedded for histopathological evaluation.
Cell culture
Human lung cancer cell lines NCI-H460, NCI-H510, and NCI-A549 were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA).
NCI-H460 cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The NCI-H510 and
NCI-A549 cells were maintained in F-12K medium with 10% FBS. All cells were grown at 37◦C with 5% CO2 in
air. THS-laden DMEM was prepared as above and diluted in complete culture medium. The culture medium was
replaced every three days with fresh THS or control supplemented culture media.
RNA isolation and sequencing
Total RNA was isolated utilizing the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and DNA was removed using RNase-free DNase (Qia-
gen). RNA quality was assessed using a BioAnalyzer. RNA sequencing was performed at the UCLA Technology Center
for Genomics & Bioinformatics (TCGB). RNA-sequencing reads were mapped to the human genome (GRCh38 ref-
erence, including alt contigs, decoy and EBV sequences; downloaded from the 1000 Genomes Project) using STAR
v2.5.2b [25], default parameters. For each replicate, per-gene counts of uniquely mapped reads were computed us-
ing HTSeq 0.6.1p2 [26] and Gencode v26 [27] primary assembly annotations. Differential expression analysis was
performed and normalized gene counts were generated using DESeq2 v1.16.1 [28]. Heatmaps were created using the
gplots v3.0.1 R package.

Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)
Total RNA samples were extracted from lung cancer tissues (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of
total RNA with One Step RT-PCR Kit (TaKaRa). qRT-PCR was performed with the SYBR Green (TaKaRa) de-
tection method on an ABI-7500 RT-PCR system (Applied Biosystems) using the following primers: CEBPB (For-
ward primer: AGCGACGAGTACAAGATCCG; Reverse primer: CATGTGCGGTTGGTTTGGAC), SLC7A11 (For-
ward primer: TGCCCAGATATGCATCGTCC; Reverse primer: TCAACCCGCGGTACTCTTTC), NUPR1 (For-

primer: GGTGTCGCTCCAGACCTATG; Reverse primer: GGAACCTTGAGCCCATTCCA).
Western blotting
Cells were homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors. Protein concentration was mea-
sured by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). The samples were prepared for loading by adding 4X sample buffer
and heating the sample at 95◦C for 5 min. Total proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF mem-
brane and analyzed by immunoblotting as previously described [29]. Membranes were probed with the following an-
tibodies: anti-p53, anti-p-p53, anti-p21, anti-Bax (Abcam), and anti-β-actin (Cell signaling). Anti-rabbit-HRP and
anti-mouse-HRP secondary antibodies (Sigma) were used.

γ-H2AX immunofluorescence
Cells were plated on glass coverslips in 24-well plates for 12 h and then treated with varying concentrations of THS
extract (1:20, 1:80, 1:160, 1:320, and control) for 24 h. The cells were washed with cold PBS and fixed with 2% PFA for
30 min at room temperature. The cells were permeabilized for 30 min in 0.2% Triton X-100. Then cells were washed
three times in staining buffer (1% BSA, 22.52 mg/ml glycine, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS) incubated for 30 min in staining
buffer at room temperature, incubated with anti-γH2AX (Abcam) overnight at 4◦C, washed three times in staining
buffer, incubated with second antibody for 1 h at room temperature, and washed three times with PBS. Next, the cells
were stained with DAPI for 10 min, washed with PBS and mounted in Vectashield (Vectorlabs). The samples were
examined using a Zeiss Axio Observer Z.1 inverted microscope combined with LSM 780 confocal module with a 40×
oil objective.
Cell proliferation and colony formation assays
For cell proliferation, cells were seeded in 96-well plates in triplicate at densities of 1×103 per well. Cell proliferation
was monitored using MTT (Sigma) (5 mg/ml) for 4 h. Light absorbance of the solution was measured at 570 nm on a
microplate reader (Bio-Rad). For colony formation, cells were seeded in triplicate at 500 cells/6-cm dish in complete
medium. After 3 weeks of growth, the cells were fixed and stained with 0.1% crystal violet (Sigma), and visible colonies
were counted according to cell numbers in each colony using a microscope (Zeiss, Axio Vert.A1).
Soft agar assay
For anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, the bottom layer was obtained by covering a six-well plate with 2 ml
of 0.5% agar in medium. On the next day, 1 ×103 cells were plated on this bottom layer in 2 ml of 0.34% agar. Colonies
were counted after 3 weeks using a microscope.
Migration and invasion assay
Cells were plated in a trans-well migration chamber with 8 μm pores (BD Biosciences) in serum-free medium and
allowed to migrate towards medium containing 10% FBS for 24 h. Cells that had migrated through the membrane
were fixed, stained, and counted. For invasion assays the migration chambers were pretreated with 50 μl Matrigel
(BD Biosciences) at 1 mg/ml.
Statistical analysis
Data were described as the mean +
− S.D. Comparisons between different groups were undertaken using the Student’
s
two-tailed t test. The limit of statistical significance was P<0.05. Statistical analysis was done with SPSS/Win11.0
software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA).
Data availability
RNA-Seq data have been deposited at NCBI SRA under accession code SUB2987635.
Results
THS exposure increases lung cancer incidence in mice
To test the tumorigenic potential of exposure to THS during development, we exposed A/J mice to THS as shown in
Figure 1a and described in the Materials and Methods. After 3 weeks of THS treatment, mice were monitored for 40
weeks until lung tumor evaluation at 47 weeks of age. We found a significant increase in the proportion of THS-treated
mice with lung tumors, compared with control mice (Figure 1b; P=0.026). Moreover, the tumors from THS-treated
mice were larger than those from control mice; some of them reached 2 mm (Figure 1c; Supplementary Table S1).
In addition, 3 of 12 THS-treated tumor-bearing mice developed multiple lung tumors (more than 3) while none of
control mice did so (Supplementary Table S1). Histological evaluation classified the lung tumors as adenocarcinoma
(Figure 1c and Supplementary Figure S1).
THS sample generation, extraction, and chemical characterization
To identify potential carcinogenic compounds in the THS-exposed cotton terry cloth we used a water-based extrac-
tion, i.e., DMEM, to determine the concentrations of chemical compounds in the samples that were used as bed-
ding material in the mouse cages. Table 1 summarizes the compounds detected and quantified in the THS-treated
DMEM and DMEM-only samples using the LC–MS/MS procedure. Nicotine was the main component detected in

the THS-treated samples. Other water-soluble nitrogenated compounds detected with varying levels include coti-
nine, 3-EP, two tobacco-specific nitrosamines (NNA and NNN), myosmine, 2,3-bipyridine, and nicotelline. All the
compounds tested were below detection levels (BLQ) in the DMEM-only samples (control) except for trace amounts
of nicotine (Table 1). Considerable variability can be expected for chemically reactive analytes such as TSNAs, 3-EP,
myosmine and N-formylnornicotine. Factors affecting variability are: THS loading on the material, amount of liquid
used in the extraction, formation of TSNAs during aging (e.g., in the presence of HONO from smoking). Relative
ratios among these analytes are comparable to those reported from other materials exposed in the same chamber [24].
Twelve PAHs were identified and quantified in the DCM extracts of THS-laden material, with a total PAH loading
of approximately 130 ng per gram of cloth. In most cases, individual PAH concentrations were close to the limit of
detection, suggesting that other PAHs may have been present at slightly lower levels and could not be analyzed by
this method. Schick et al. [14] identified a total of 16 PAHs in the gas phase and particulate matter after smoking
in the same chamber, which included the twelve analytes detected in the cloth THS sample. No PAHs were found in
unexposed (control) cloth specimens.
THS exposure induces ER stress and activates p53 signaling
To begin to elucidate the molecular mechanisms associated with increased lung cancer incidence in THS-exposed
mice, we exposed human H510 and H460 lung cancer cells to DMEM extracts of the THS-cloth (n = 3) or DMEM

alone (n = 3) for 12 consecutive days (Figure 2a). RNA-seq analysis of RNAs from THS-treated H510 cells revealed
that THS exposure modulated 1502 transcripts (682 up-regulated and 820 down-regulated compared with the con-
trol; adj. P<0.05 and fold-change>1.5; Figure 2b; Supplementary Table S2), which corresponds to 1385 genes. THS
induced change in gene expression was validated for some genes using qRT-PCR (Supplementary Figure S2). Since
some compounds found in THS are also present in mainstream smoke, not surprisingly, we found a significant over-
lap with a published non-tumor human lung tissue smoking signature (Figure 2c; P<0.01) [30], suggesting that at
least part of the in vitro transcriptional response to THS is similar to transcriptional changes in active smokers. We
next mapped the 1385 differentially expressed genes to biological functions, pathways and upstream transcriptional
regulators using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis for the computations. We observed significant enrichment of p53 sig-
naling and integrated stress response pathways and genes regulated by TP53, ATF3, ATF4 NUPR1, and DDIT3 in
THS-exposed cells (Figure 2d,e; Supplementary Table S3). ATF4 and DDIT3 up-regulation indicate activation of the
integrated stress response to accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, amino acid starvation,
or oxidants.

To test whether p53 is activated by THS exposure we examined p53 protein stability and phosphorylation in human
H460 and H510 lung cancer cell lines. We treated cells for 24 h at THS extract dilutions ranging from 1:40 to 1:320. We
found that the total protein level of p53 was not affected by THS treatment. However, an increase in phosphorylation at
Ser15 was observed in a dose dependent manner at 1:40 and 1:80 THS dilutions (Figure 3a,b). Protein levels of the p53
transcriptional targets p21 and BAX were also increased at 1:40 and 1:80 THS dilutions. To determine the persistence
of p53 activation we measured phosphorylated p53, p21, and BAX in H460 and H510 cells treated with THS at a 1:40
dilution for 24, 48 and 96 h time points. Phosphorylated p53, p21, and BAX increased sharply at 24 h, after which levels
returned to baseline at 96 h (Figure 3c,d). Finally, similar results were observed in the human lung adenocarcinoma
cell line A549 (Supplementary Figure S3a) and lung tissues from mice exposed to THS (Supplementary Figure S4).
THS exposure induces DNA double-strand breaks
Previous studies using the comet assay showed that exposure of human liver HepG2 cells to THS for 24 h resulted
in significant increases in DNA strand breaks [15]. To test whether or not THS induces DNA double-strand breaks
(DSBs) in human lung cells, we treated H460 and H510 cancer cells with THS at dilutions ranging from 1:40 to 1:320
for 24 h and measured γ-H2AX foci (Figure 4a). Histone H2AX is specifically phosphorylated at the sites of DSBs, and
antibodies against phospho-H2AX (γ-H2AX) have been developed to pinpoint the sites of DSBs [31]. We observed a
dose-dependent increase in the number of cells with more than 5 foci compared with controls (Figure 4b). The treated

cells had significantly higher levels of DSBs (P<0.01) compared with those of controls, even at the lowest dilution
tested (1:320). This observation was also demonstrated in A549 cells (Supplementary Figure S3b).
THS exposure does not influence migration and invasion
We next examined whether 12-day continuous THS exposure increases tumorigenic properties of cells in vitro
(Figure 2a). We first assessed the effects of THS exposure on the migration capability of THS-treated H460 and
H510 cells related to tumor metastasis. We found that the migration of both cell lines did not increase significantly
compared with control cells (Supplementary Figure S5a,b). In addition, cell invasion was not significantly enhanced
by THS treatment either (Supplementary Figure S5c,d).
THS exposure increases growth and tumorigenic potential in vitro
We then assessed the effects of THS on cell proliferation and colony formation as described in the Methods section.
THS-treated H460 (Figure 5a), H510 cells (Figure 5b) and A549 (Supplementary Figure S3c) exhibited increased cell
proliferation compared with their control cells. Furthermore, THS-treated H460 and H510 cells exhibited significant
increases in the number of colonies with >200 cells and total number of colonies compared with controls (Figure
5c,d).
THS exposure increases colony formation in soft agar
To measure anchorage-independent growth, a property of malignant cells, we assessed the effects of THS exposure
on colony forming ability in soft agar in H460 and H510 cells. Cells were exposed for twelve consecutive days to THS

Discussion
In this work, we showed for the first time that THS exposure during early life (the juvenile period) significantly in-
creases lung cancer incidence in A/J mice. Although current evidence, including animal studies, suggests that THS
may be a potential health threat to infants and young children who are in smokers’homes, virtually nothing is known

about the long-term effects of early THS exposure on tumor development in later life. Some of the chemical con-
stituents identified from THS are known carcinogens that are the same as those present in the mainstream smoke
and SHS, such as PAHs and TSNAs, albeit at different concentrations. Interestingly, TSNAs can also be generated
de novo in THS, as described before [13]. As for lung cancer induction, these two classes of chemical compounds
have been shown to be potent carcinogens, among the multiple carcinogens convincingly identified from cigarette
smoke to cause lung tumors in laboratory animals or humans [32]. Therefore, they are likely to play major roles in
lung carcinogenesis by THS.
Diverse confounding factors in humans, such as genetic and environmental conditions, may limit our ability to
draw definitive conclusions about the biological and health impacts of THS. In addition, currently it is very difficult
to separate the effects of THS from SHS in human populations because most people who are affected by ‘
passive
smoking’receive a mixed exposure to both SHS and THS. Mouse models offer many advantages for assessing health
risks after THS exposure, because they allow control of both the genetic and environmental components of risk. The
A/J mice strain is susceptible to spontaneous lung cancer development and has been a useful test system in the field of
tobacco carcinogenesis, particularly in investigating lung cancer induced by specific carcinogens such as mainstream
cigarette smoke and SHS [33-36].
The conditions used in our mouse exposure to THS were intended to mimic human exposures. Analysis of the
THS samples used in our animal studies showed the presence of nicotine and carcinogens including TSNAs and
PAHs (Table 1). Assuming that uptake of nicotine through ingestion, inhalation, and dermal routes was quantitative,
the predicted dose was 77 μg/kg day of bodyweight. This value is comparable to the ingestion exposure of a tod-
dler estimated by Bahl et al. [24]. Interestingly, all the concentrations including those of nicotine, cotinine, 2,3’
-BP,
TSNAs (NNA and NNN), nicotelline, myosmine, and N-formylnornicotine (Table 1) were several-fold lower than
those reported by Bahl et al. for cell-culture based assays when the same extraction method was used [24], indicating
that the exposure levels in our experiments were reasonable. It should be noted that the aqueous and organic extracts

that we analyzed may underestimate the actual exposure of the mice. Their ingestion and dermal exposure may have
included TSNAs and PAHs that are not extractable in DMEM or DCM.
It is well known that tobacco carcinogens, such as those found in THS [8], generate a broad spectrum of DNA
lesions ranging from sugar damage, oxidized bases and bulky base adducts to more deleterious lesions such as DNA
strand breaks. Research has shown that formation of DNA adducts plays a central role in smoking-induced mutage-
nesis and carcinogenesis [37]. If DNA adducts are not repaired, they can cause miscoding during DNA replication,
thus leading to mutations [37]. Our previous studies on DNA strand breaks and oxidative base damage [15,16] made
important contributions to the initial understanding of the genotoxic effects of THS, and they raised concerns about
the carcinogenic potential of exposure to THS. We also observed that NNA, which is highly selective for THS in
environments with combustion sources, reacts with dG in vitro to form a bulky cyclic adduct [38].
Studying THS-induced DNA damage may provide mechanistic insight into how THS may cause neoplastic trans-
formation. There are many studies that addressed the relationships between tobacco carcinogen exposure, DNA dam-
age, mutagenic potential, and increased cancer risk related to smoking [37]. For example, PAH-DNA adducts are
preferentially formed in the same mutational hotspots of p53 as in the lung cancers of smokers [39]. This tumor
suppressor gene is mutated in ∼40% of lung cancer cases [39]. Tobacco smoke also produces reactive oxygen species
(ROS) and induces oxidative stress. The lesions that arise directly from ROS attack on a base, such as 8-oxoguanine
(8-oxoG), could also play a role in tobacco carcinogenesis. We previously reported high levels of 8-oxoG and other
oxidized lesions in mouse skin wounds exposed to THS [16]. Moreover, we demonstrated that THS exposure induces
DNA strand breaks including DSBs. Mispair or lack of repair of a DSB can result in mutations or generate dicentric
or acentric chromosomal fragments [40]. DSBs can also activate the p53 signaling pathway as evidenced by increased
expression of the p53 targets p21 and BAX, as shown in this study. Therefore, one mechanism for THS-mediated
carcinogenesis may be related to the formation of DSBs that can lead to genomic instability resulting in oncogenic
transformation and increased cancer risk [41].
Clinical perspectives
•
We investigated the effects of short-term early exposure to THS on lung carcinogenesis.
•
This study demonstrates that exposure to THS during early life can increase lung cancer risk in
A/J mice and that THS exposure induces DNA DSBs and enhances tumorigenic traits in human
lung cancer cells.
•
These data suggest that THS exposure is a potential risk factor for human lung cancer. Such in-
formation could be critical for preventing and controlling THS-induced biological and health harm,
as well as for framing and enforcing new policies against indoor smoking in the U.S., China, and
other countries.
