Gait recovery after neurological disorders requires remastering the interplay between body mechanics and gravita-
tional forces. Despite the importance of gravity-dependent gait interactions and active participation for promoting
this learning, these essential components of gait rehabilitation have received comparatively little attention. To ad-
dress these issues, we developed an adaptive algorithm that personalizes multidirectional forces applied to the
trunk based on patient-specific motor deficits. Implementation of this algorithm in a robotic interface reestablished
gait dynamics during highly participative locomotion within a large and safe environment. This multidirectional
gravity-assist enabled natural walking in nonambulatory individuals with spinal cord injury or stroke and enhanced
skilled locomotor control in the less-impaired subjects. A 1-hour training session with multidirectional gravity-assist
improved locomotor performance tested without robotic assistance immediately after training, whereas walking the
same distance on a treadmill did not ameliorate gait. These results highlight the importance of precise trunk support
to deliver gait rehabilitation protocols and establish a practical framework to apply these concepts in clinical routine.
INTRODUCTION
Terrestrial locomotion is inherently contingent on gravity (1). Although
gravity challenges equilibrium at each step, the gravitational forces
acting upon body mechanics enable the generation of ground reaction
forces (GRFs) that propel the body forward (2, 3). The bipedal posture
of humans exacerbates the beneficial impact of gravity on gait dynamics
(3–7). The elevated center of mass (CoM) allows the human body to
vault up and over the stance leg analogous to an inverted pendulum (6),
whereas the contralateral leg performs a near-ballistic oscillation (8).
The apparent simplicity of the inverted pendulum-like gait behav-
ior conceals sophisticated neurological control mechanisms (9, 10),
which require several years of neural development to become mature
(11). However, locomotor impairments resulting from neurological in-
sults such as spinal cord injury (SCI) and stroke remind us of the in-
stability of human gait and the complexity of its neural control.
Neurologically impaired individuals must exploit residual neural
circuits to regain strength, precision, and balance to remaster the del-
icate interplay between body mechanics and gravitational forces.
Partial body weight–supported gait therapy is the most common
medical practice to facilitate this process (12, 13). Robotic engineering
has developed various types of body weight support systems. The most
common solutions include passive springs, counterweight mecha-
nisms, or force-controlled apparatus that deliver upward trunk support
during stepping on a treadmill. These approaches suffer from several
drawbacks. First, treadmill belt motion dictates the locomotor pace,
imposing challenging conditions for neurologically impaired individuals
who exhibit variable gait patterns (14). Second, treadmill-restricted en-
vironments markedly differ from the rich repertoire of natural locomo-
tor activities underlying daily living. Task-specific rehabilitation is
essential to maximize gait recovery (15, 16). Third, vertically restricted
trunk support creates undesired forces that impede gait execution
(17–19). Fourth, overground rehabilitation triggers more active partic-
ipation than treadmill-restricted training, which is critical for steering
neural circuit reorganization after neurological disorders (20).
We previously developed robotic systems for mice (21) and rats
(22) that addressed these issues. These suspension devices integrate
soft actuation mechanisms that allow the application of multidirec-
tional forces to the trunk while the rodents are progressing freely with-
in a large workspace. These robot systems enabled skilled locomotion
in rodents with SCI or stroke (22–24) and maximized activity-
dependent neural circuit reorganization during rehabilitation (20, 23).
To establish a similar gait rehabilitation platform for humans, we used
a robotic system that allows fine adjustment of forces applied to the
trunk along the three Cartesian directions (25). The quadrupedal pos-
ture of rodents minimizes the mechanical impact of trunk support on
dynamic balance. However, the application of forces to the trunk in the
bipedal posture of humans is likely to exert additional and specific
constraints. We found that a vertically restricted trunk support pro-
foundly alters gait dynamics. The addition of well-calibrated forward
forces alleviated these effects. Therefore, we developed an adaptive
multidirectional gravity-assist (MGA) algorithm that determines up-
ward and forward forces applied to the trunk to reestablish gravity-
dependent gait interactions while providing a support tailored to
patient-specific needs.
This MGA enabled natural walking in nonambulatory individuals
with SCI or stroke and enhanced skilled locomotion in less-impaired
subjects. After a 1-hour gait training session with MGA, individuals

assistance. These combined results stress the importance of applying
precise assistive trunk support during gait rehabilitation.
RESULTS
Properties of the neurorobotic platform
We used a cable robot (25) that provides a safe environment, preventing
falls while allowing control of forces applied to the trunk through a
dedicated harness (fig. S1) along the three Cartesian directions during
locomotion in a large workspace (Fig. 1A). We integrated the robotic
interface within a platform (21), allowing real-time acquisition of forces
applied to the trunk, whole-body kinematics, GRFs, and muscle activity
(Fig. 1B).
To evaluate the absence of detrimental interactions between the
robotic system and locomotor performance, we recorded leg kinemat-
ics, muscle activity, and kinetics during walking without and with ro-
bot in eight healthy individuals. The robot delivered a 40-N upward
force, which corresponds to the minimal upward force necessary to
maintain tension in the cables (transparent mode). Most of the com-
puted gait parameters did not differ between both conditions (fig. S2A).
However, the upward force (40 N) did lead to a small decrease in the
amplitude of the vertical and anteroposterior components of GRFs
(fig. S2B). These kinetic alterations were associated with a decrease
in speed (fig. S2A) and an increase in the activity of ankle extensor
muscles (medial gastrocnemius; fig. S2C).
When applying forces with the robot, the resulting interaction
force components displayed variabilities due to imprecision in the
force controller, dynamic friction, and inertia (25). However, the varia-
bility remained confined within 4.2 ± 1.7 N for forward forces, 3.5 ±
1.8 N for lateral forces, and 6.2 ± 1.2 N for upward forces (net force,
6.4 ± 1.3N). As expected, inaccuracies increased during locomotion
along a sinusoidal path (n = 6 subjects), but even in these challenging
conditions, the alterations of gait patterns remained minimal (fig. S2D).
These combined results indicate that the robotic attachment exerted
minimal interference with the production of gait.
Impact of upward and forward forces on posture and gait
We next evaluated the effects of forces applied to the trunk during
standing and walking in healthy individuals. We first studied the
impact of upward forces during standing. The upright human body
can be modeled as an inverted pendulum (Fig. 2A). Because of the
natural forward tilt of the body (b), the CoM projects in front of
the rotational axis (ankle) of the pendulum. Consequently, the mean
anteroposterior position of the center of plantar pressure (CoP) was
located at 25 ± 1% of the base of support length (n = 5 subjects). This
biomechanical configuration allowed the maintenance of balance
through the tonic activation of antigravity muscles acting at the ankle
(Fig. 2A) (26).
The application of upward forces (40 to 500 N) induced a back-
ward tilt, which shifted the CoP position toward the heels (Fig. 2B).
Subjects displayed increased postural sways, paralleled by considerable
changes in ankle muscle activity patterns (Fig. 2A). We found that a
forward force compensated for the detrimental impacts of upward
force. Forward forces restored the position and dynamics of the
CoP, which reestablished appropriate ankle muscle activity (Fig. 2,
A and B).
We then evaluated the occurrence of similar interactions between
upward and forward forces during locomotion. To capture the effects
of force interactions, we calculated a comprehensive number of param-
eters (n = 120; table S1) that we subjected to a principal components
analysis (PCA) (fig. S3) (22, 27). Upward forces alone led to a gradual
alteration of gait features and muscle activity (Fig. 2, B to D, and fig. S4,
A and B). We detected negative correlations between upward forces and
the alteration of key gait features, such as
the stride length (R2 = 0.78), speed (R2 =
0.91), and antigravity muscle activity
(fig. S4, C and D). Large upward forces
required an abnormal activation of knee
flexor muscles during stance to pull the
body forward, concomitant to a threefold
drop in the activation of antigravity muscles
(Fig. 2C and fig. S4, A and C).
The application of increasing forward
forces mediated a gradual recovery of the
stride length, speed, double stance dura-
tion, and antigravity muscle activity (Fig.
2, B to D, fig. S4, E to H, and movie S1).
Forward forces improved the oscillations
of the CoM and the profile of GRFs (Fig.
2C). Analysis of the interactions between
upward and forward forces during walk-
ing on a treadmill confirmed these ob-
servations (fig. S5A and movie S1). These
results highlight critical interactions be-
tween upward and forward forces on
posture and gait with body weight sup-
port, stressing the importance of de-
veloping evidence-based procedures to
configure these forces based on patient-
specific needs.

 Gravity-assist: Personalization of upward force
Individuals with motor deficits require personalized upward forces to
compensate for their specific impairments. Currently, therapists select
this support from empirical observations. Here, we aimed at devel-
oping an algorithm that configures upward forces based on objective
measurements.
Nine subjects with SCI or stroke were asked to stand with robot-
ic assistance (table S2). To determine the optimal upward force, we
recorded kinematics, kinetics, and muscle activity over a range of
upward forces (from 15 to 70% of body weight, depending on the
capacity of each subject; Fig. 3A). We applied a PCA on the computed
parameters (n = 15, table S1) recorded in each subject and healthy

 individual (n = 5). The optimal upward force was defined as the con-
dition minimizing the distance to healthy individuals (Fig. 3B).
This method requires extensive recordings that are unpractical in
clinical practice. To automate this procedure, we applied a supervised
machine learning using an artificial neural network that predicted op-
timal upward forces for each subject based on easily collected kine-
matic and kinetic variables (n = 12; table S1). The artificial neural
network aimed at minimizing errors in the predicted corrections of
upward forces (D, percentage of body weight). Performances were
tested on independent data sets (32 trials, n = 3 subjects). The errors
in the predicted corrections never exceeded 5% of the experimentally
measured optimal upward force (Fig. 3C).
Gravity-assist: Personalization of forward force
We next sought to calibrate the forward force during walking for each
upward force and patient-specific needs. To guide this process, we
performed simulations using a damped, spring-loaded inverted pen-
dulum model. This simulation captures the main features of human
locomotion (see Supplementary Materials and Methods). As observed
experimentally, upward forces reduced the walking speed, stride
length, and CoM oscillations. Simulations searched the optimal con-
figuration to normalize the speed, stride length, and CoM oscillations
toward values obtained without any external force. We obtained an
inverted, U-shaped curve defining the forward force correction at a
given speed (Fig. 3D).
We exploited these results to guide the experimental identification
of forward force corrections. Individuals with neurological deficits ex-
hibit optimal performance at a preferred speed. Because forward force
corrections were linked to the speed, we created a map integrating the
preferred speed in the configuration of the MGA. Twenty-two subjects
with SCI or stroke walked with optimal upward force and a narrow
range of forward forces centered around the values derived from sim-
ulations. Optimal locomotor performances were calculated from the
PCA (fig. S3). To calculate optimal upward and forward forces for
each speed, we fitted an optimal polynomial function to the data.
We obtained an inverted, U-shaped map (Fig. 3D). We used this de-
cision map to configure the MGA in the subsequent experiments.
Gravity-assist: Validation
We next evaluated the performance of the MGA algorithm to estab-
lish optimal upward and forward forces during locomotion. We tested
the algorithm in six individuals with SCI or stroke (table S2) using a
framework that can easily be implemented in clinical routine (Fig. 4A).
Subjects were first recorded during standing with optimal upward force
and with the addition or subtraction of an upward force corresponding
to 10% of their body weight. The optimal force was determined with
PCA. For each condition of upward forces, kinematic and kinetic re-
cordings were independently provided to the artificial neural network,
which calculated upward force corrections to establish the optimal con-
dition for each subject. For example, Fig. 4B shows kinematic and ki-
netic recordings during walking for one of the subjects included in the
testing data set of the artificial neural network. This subject was not
capable of standing or walking independently [SCI_BME, American
Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS) C; table
S2]. The artificial neural network yielded the same predictions of opti-
mal upward force, regardless of the initial upward force (among the
three tested force values). We used this correction and the preferred
walking speed to configure the forward force using the decision map
(Fig. 3D).

 The MGA enabled this subject to progress overground with
coordinated, weight-bearing locomotor movements (Fig. 4B). Im-
proved dynamics of the CoM revealed the partial restoration of
gravity-dependent gait interactions (Fig. 4C). A 10% increase or de-
crease in the amount of upward force drastically altered gait features,
almost preventing this subject from progressing forward (Fig. 4B and
movie S2).
We measure the performance of the MGA algorithm using a PCA
applied on all the kinematic parameters (n = 120; table S1 and fig. S3,
A and B). Locomotor performance was quantified as the distance be-
tween each subject and healthy individuals in the space defined by
PC1 and PC2 (fig. S3C). This analysis showed that the MGA algorithm
yielded appropriate configurations of upward and forward forces in
all of the tested subjects [P < 0.001, repeated-measures two-way anal-
ysis of variance (ANOVA); Fig. 4C and
movie S2]. The importance of the preci-
sion in the MGA configuration increased
with the severity of gait deficits, as quan-
tified with PCA scores (R2 = 0.88 and P <
0.01; Fig. 4D). The pronounced modulation
of individual gait parameters confirmed
the importance of the MGA configuration
to facilitate locomotion (Fig. 4E). These
results illustrate the critical importance of
personalizing upward and forward forces
to enable locomotion in neurologically im-
paired subjects and validate the capacity
of the MGA algorithm to configure these
forces based on patient-specific needs.
Gravity-assist: Improvement of
locomotor performance after SCI
and stroke
We next tested the capacity of the MGA to
enable or enhance locomotor performance
in two cohorts of individuals with varying
severities of SCI (n = 15) and stroke (n =
12). Locomotor performance ranged from
nonambulatory individuals who could
neither stand nor walk independently to
individuals with mild motor impairments
who could walk without assistive device
(table S2).
With the exception of nonambulatory
individuals, all of the subjects were first re-
corded during locomotion without the ro-
bot using the assistive device that they
used in their daily life. All the subjects were
then evaluated during locomotion with
MGA, both with and without assistive de-
vice when possible. Kinematic variables
(n = 120; table S1) recorded in healthy in-
dividuals (n = 13) and in all of the subjects
with SCI or stroke were subjected to
separate PCA analyses to quantify loco-
motor performance. These quantifications
revealed that the MGA enabled walking in
nonambulatory subjects with kinematic
features similar to ambulatory subjects,
both after SCI (Fig. 5) and stroke (Fig. 6).
Each subject showed specific responses,
which are documented in database S1 that
shows individual gait analyses for the 26
individuals with SCI or stroke.
To identify the specific gait features
improved by the MGA, we extracted the

 parameters that highly correlated with PC1 and PC2 (factor load-
ings, |value| > 0.5) and regrouped them into functional clusters
corresponding to basic gait features. We first conducted this analysis
for individuals with SCI (Fig. 5A). We found that PC1 quantified im-
provements of leg kinematics, whereas PC2 captured changes in pos-
tural control. The improvements depended on the initial locomotor
performance (R2 = 0.64, P < 0.005). For example, the MGA enabled
subjects who could not stand independently to walk overground with
or without assistive device (three of three subjects; Fig. 5, B and C, top
row). Subjects who were only able to locomote with crutches or a
walker progressed without assistive device (4 of 10 subjects) and ex-
hibited improved spatiotemporal gait features (Fig. 5, B and C, middle
rows). Subjects who were able to walk without assistive device exhib-
ited increased postural stability (Fig. 5, B and C, bottom row, and
movie S3).
Individuals with stroke exhibited similar or even superior amelio-
ration of locomotor performance (Fig. 6 and movie S3). The PCA
(Fig. 6A) showed that individuals who could only walk with crutches
exhibited improved intralimb coordination (Fig. 6, B and C, middle
row). Individuals who walked without assistive device showed im-
provements of basic gait parameters, such as the stride length and
walking speed, as well as enhanced arm movements and improved
gait symmetry (Fig. 6, B and C, bottom row). Together, these results
show that the MGA enabled or enhanced locomotor control in indi-
viduals with severe to moderate gait deficits due to SCI or stroke.
Gravity-assist: Improvement of locomotor performance after
a 1-hour training session
We then sought to demonstrate the ability of the overground gait
training environment with MGA to improve locomotor performance.
We enrolled five subjects with a chronic SCI who were capable of
walking overground but only with an assistive device (table S2). They
participated in two training sessions, separated by 1 week (Fig. 7A).
During the first session (60 min), subjects walked overground with
MGA. During the second training session (week 2), they were asked
to walk the same distance on a treadmill. Immediately before and after
each training session, the subjects were recorded during overground
locomotion without MGA at their own selected pace using their
preferred assistive device.
With the exception of the least-affected subject, the training session
with MGA mediated a significant increase (P < 0.001 for four of five
subjects) in locomotor performance in all the participants. For example,
the increase in gait speed and decrease in double stance duration
enabled by the MGA throughout the training persisted during
overground locomotion without MGA (Fig. 7B, left). However, evalua-
tions conducted 1 week later revealed that these improvements did not
persist (Fig. 7B). In contrast, overground locomotor performance re-
mained unchanged or even deteriorated after treadmill-restricted step
training (Fig. 7C). Basic gait features, such as the speed and double
stance duration, improved during training, but the values returned to
baseline when the subjects walked overground with their assistive device
after training (Fig. 7B). These results show that a 1-hour gait training
session facilitated by the MGA improved locomotor performance im-
mediately after training (movie S4).
Gravity-assist: Training of skilled locomotion and
dynamic balance
Task-specific training plays a critical role in determining the outcome
of gait rehabilitation (16). We thus tested the ability of the MGA to
enable tasks underlying activities of daily living. We first tested skilled
foot placements along the rungs of a horizontal ladder placed 15 cm
above the ground in subjects with SCI or stroke who displayed suffi-
cient locomotor performance for this task (n = 13). Without the
MGA, these subjects considered this task too challenging or too risky.
The MGA allowed all the tested subjects to climb up the staircase and
progress with accurate foot placement onto the rungs of the ladder
(Fig. 8A and movie S5).
The multidirectional actuation of the MGA also allowed the subjects
to practice their steering abilities, dynamic balance, and upper/lower
limb coordination during natural walking. For instance, they could walk
safely along a curvilinear path projected onto the floor without assistive
device (Fig. 8B). Finally, we studied the ability to train dynamic balance.
We designed perturbations consisting of laterally oriented forces that
were applied to the trunk suddenly or continuously during walking.
As expected, the perturbations altered the trajectory, position, and pos-
ture of the trunk (Fig. 8C and movie S5). These perturbations thus allow
training and evaluation of dynamic balance in a safe environment.
Together, these results illustrate the ability of the MGA to enable activ-
ities of daily living that require skilled and finely balanced movements,
thus providing the opportunity to expand task-specific training in neu-
rologically impaired individuals.
DISCUSSION
We developed an algorithm that configures upward and forward
support forces applied to the trunk to restore gait dynamics despite
the application of a body weight support during standing and walking.
The MGA establishes a safe and natural rehabilitation environment
wherein individuals with neurological deficits can perform basic and
skilled locomotor activities that would not be possible without robotic
assistance. This environment allows task-specific training in optimal
conditions. The immediate and short-term ameliorations of gait
performance during locomotion with MGA illustrate the potential
of this environment to augment motor recovery.
Partial body weight–supported gait therapy is a common medical
practice to improve recovery after neurological disorders (12, 13). This
condition allows the repetition of locomotor movements that would
not be possible without assistance. Currently, therapists configure the
amount of support empirically based on visual observations. As ob-
served in rodents (22, 23), we found that the clinical phenotype of
each neurologically impaired subject determined the precise amount
of upward support required to facilitate gait execution. In most of the
affected subjects, even minimal changes in support conditions strongly
affected locomotor performance.
Current body weight support systems generally deliver assistance
restricted to the upward direction (18). Yet, we found that the ap-
plication of upward forces induced a backward shift in body orien-
tation, which considerably destabilized the control of standing and
walking. The addition of well-calibrated forward forces was critical
to restore the postural orientation and thus alleviate the undesirable
impact of upward forces on gait and balance. The detrimental effects
of a vertically restricted body weight support were similar on a
treadmill.
These results confirmed previous findings that high amounts of
body weight support lead to abnormal patterns of leg muscle activity,
which would be detrimental for relearning to walk (19). This observa-
tion led to the recommendation to limit the amount of body weight
support to 30 or 40% (19, 28). This guideline has been consistently

 applied in clinical studies (29–31). However, our results indicate that this
recommendation arises from an improper configuration of the trunk
support. These findings may partly explain why locomotor training on
a treadmill with body weight support was not shown to be superior to
progressive exercise at home managed by a physical therapist after SCI
(32) or stroke (33). Together, these observations reveal that the prevailing
design and utilization of clinical body weight support systems are sub-
optimal for the rehabilitation of posture and gait.

 On the contrary, the MGA established a rehabilitation environment
that is mechanically and physiologically optimized for patient-specific
needs. The external constraints can be adapted to the residual motor
control abilities of each patient within each session and throughout a
rehabilitation program. The resulting facilitation of gait execution was
unexpected. Subjects with SCI or stroke immediately exhibited im-
proved locomotor performance, which translated into the ability to
walk overground for nonambulatory individuals who had sufficient re-
sidual control over leg movements. For the least-affected individuals,
the MGA allowed skilled locomotor activities that were not possible
without robotic assistance. This result is important because task-specific
training determines the outcome of gait rehabilitation after neurological
disorders (16).
The MGA restored kinematic and kinetic patterns that resembled
natural gait dynamics. Despite the application of upward force, both
healthy and neurologically impaired subjects regained the profiles of
GRFs that are specific to human walking. We surmise that these gravity-
dependent gait interactions are critical for learning and relearning to
walk. For example, evidence suggests that gravity-dependent gait in-
teractions during the first unsupported steps in toddlers act as a func-
tional trigger for gait maturation (34, 35).
The short-term improvements of locomotor performance after a
1-hour training session corroborated this hypothesis. The practice of
natural walking with the MGA enabled the subjects to become confi-
dent in their residual motor abilities and to relearn the interactions
between their body mechanics and gravitational forces. Hence, this
type of robotic assistance in a safe yet natural environment represents
an ecological approach to gait rehabilitation (36). Similar learning did
not occur on a treadmill. Moreover, the MGA enabled the practice of
skilled locomotion, steering, and balance in natural conditions. We
suggest that training neurologically impaired individuals in these ac-
tivities of daily living, which can only be practiced naturally with
MGA, may lead to enhanced recovery (16). Such task-specific training
may facilitate the transition into community ambulation.
These results need to be confirmed in
a larger number of subjects and through a
long period of rehabilitation. The 1-hour
training session was insufficient to medi-
ate lasting locomotor improvements. Here,
we provided a clinically relevant framework
to implement such rehabilitation programs
across multiple activities of daily living for
subjects with various types and severities of
neurological deficits.
The significant role of gravity-dependent
gait interactions in enabling or enhancing
motor control after neurological disorders
stresses the importance of optimizing the
hardware and software underlying the
MGA algorithm. In the present scenario,
the forces applied to the trunk remained
constant throughout gait execution. More-
over, the MGA only targeted upward and
forward oscillations. However, the dy-
namics of human gait require precisely
timed trunk movements in multiple di-
rections (4, 17, 34, 37). For example, the
cyclic mediolateral movements of the
trunk play a pivotal function in balance
regulation during locomotion. We thus
predict that the application of time-varying
forces, tailored to specific phases of the gait
cycle in each of the relevant Cartesian
directions as well as torques, will further
improve the interactions between body
mechanics and gravitational forces—and
thus the facilitation of gait execution. Pre-
dicting this dynamic MGA from simula-
tions would require a more advanced
biomechanical model to emulate the mul-
tidirectional interactions between body dy-
namics and gravitational forces. This type
of assistance also relies on a number of
hardware and software innovations to ex-
pand the spectrum of locations where
forces and moments can be applied and

movement feedback. Here, we introduced a neurorobotic platform that
combines important features to implement dynamic trunk assistance.
Additional improvements may play an important role in optimiz-
ing the performance and usability of the robotic platform, particularly
for dynamic assistance. For instance, the force controller introduced
variability in the interaction forces that may be optimized with more
precise sensors and improved robot mechanics. Furthermore, the
smart design of the trunk harness may reduce the displacement of
the body CoM by moving the force application to the pelvis (38).
These hardware and software improvements combined with real-time
force adaptation may greatly improve locomotor performance in
injured individuals.
Evidence suggests that gait re-
habilitation should be conducted
overground (39) across activities of
daily living (16, 40), with optimized
support conditions (39, 41, 42),
enabling systems (41, 43–46), un-
constrained arm movements (47, 48),
and active participation (43, 49),
but these concepts remain fragmen-
ted. Here, we introduced a neuroro-
botic platform that crystallizes these
views into a unified framework to
augment gait recovery after neuro-
logical disorders.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
Our goal was to develop an evidenced-
based algorithm that configures multi-
directional forces applied to the trunk
to establish a natural environment
enabling each individual with neuro-
logical deficits to perform locomo-
tion in natural conditions. For this
purpose, we implemented eight ex-
perimental protocols that were ap-
proved by the local ethical committee
of the Canton de Vaud (Switzerland,
no. 141/14). The evaluations were
conducted at the University Hospi-
tal of Vaud (CHUV)
Protocol 1: Evaluation of the neu-
rorobotic platform during locomo-
tion along straight and curvilinear
paths in eight healthy individuals.
Protocol 2: Impact of upward and
forward forces applied to the trunk
on the kinematics, kinetics, and
muscle activity during standing and
walking. Evaluations in five healthy
individuals.
Protocol 3: Development of the
algorithm that automatically con-
figures upward forces. Recordings
were performed during standing
and walking over varying upward forces in nine subjects with SCI
or stroke.
Protocol 4: Development of a decision map that automatically ad-
justs forward force corrections. Computational simulations were com-
pleted with recordings of 22 subjects with SCI or stroke during
locomotion.
Protocol 5: Validation of the MGA algorithm developed in protocol
3 and 4. Six subjects with SCI or stroke were recorded during walking
with MGA and small variations of upward and forward forces.
Protocol 6: Ability of the MGA to improve locomotor performance
during walking. Fifteen subjects with SCI and 12 subjects with stroke were
recorded during locomotion with MGA. Locomotor performance was
compared to 13 healthy individuals.

showing a subject with SCI who could position his feet onto the irregularly spaced rungs of a ladder projected onto the floor
during locomotion assisted with two crutches. The subject could not walk over the actual ladder in this condition. The MGA
enabled the subject to climb up the first staircase and to progress onto the actual ladder without assistive device. (B) Succes-
sive positions of the trunk in the coronal plane while a subject with SCI was asked to progress along a curvilinear path
projected onto the floor, both without and with MGA. The CoM trajectory and acceleration are also displayed, together with
the position of the feet (dashes) during stance and their trajectory during swing. The dot indicates the positions of the crutches
onto the floor without MGA. (C) Image sequences showing the behavior of a subject with SCI during the application of postural
perturbations during walking. The perturbation is schematized above each sequence. Left: Sudden leftward and then rightward
forces. Right: Sustained leftward and then rightward forces. The impact of these perturbations on the position, posture, and
trajectory of the trunk and feet are shown.

 Protocol 7: Five subjects with SCI performed two 1-hour training
sessions: (i) overground with MGA and (ii) on a treadmill with up-
ward support only. Locomotor performance was measured before and
after training without robotic assistance.
Protocol 8: Thirteen subjects with SCI or stroke performed skilled
locomotion along the irregularly spaced rungs of a horizontal ladder
and along a curved path projected on the floor with and without
MGA. A virtual ladder was projected on the floor in the condition
without robot. The subjects were also tested during walking while re-
ceiving a sudden or sustained lateral perturbation.
All measurements were obtained using objective readouts with
high-precision equipment. Blinding during data acquisition and anal-
ysis was notpossible because ofobvious differences between conditions
with and without robot. All the recorded gait cycles were included in
the analyses (excluding gait initiation and termination). No statistical
outliners were excluded.
Participants
Twenty-six subjects with SCI or stroke and 13 healthy individuals took
part in the study. Written informed consent was obtained for each par-
ticipant. The protocols conformed to the latest revision of the Declara-
tion of Helsinki. All the subjects were followed by a physician from the
neurorehabilitation department (S.C.). Before their enrollment, their
medical history was collected together with standard neurological eva-
luations. For subjectswithstroke, motorscoreswere measuredusing the
Motricity Index (50), whereas the severity was evaluated using the Func-
tional Independence Measure (51). AIS and WISCI-II (Walking Index for
Spinal Cord Injury II) scores were collected in subjects with SCI. The main
characteristics of the subjects are summarized in table S2.
Neurorobotic platform
Commercially available technologies were integrated within a neuro-
robotic platform that combines the following: (i) a physiological re-
cording unit monitoring kinematics (VICON), kinetics (9260AA6,
Kistler), and muscle activity signals (myon 320, myon AG); (ii) a ro-
botic body weight support system (The FLOAT, Lutz Engineering)
(22); and (iii) a control processing unit (see Supplementary Material
and Methods). All three units were interconnected via an ethernet
network using a real-time EtherCAT bus, as previously described
for the system developed in rodents (21).
Behavioral tasks
Subjects were recorded during standing or walking without or with
robotic assistance across four paradigms: standing on two separate
force plates, locomotion along a straight path, locomotion along a si-
nusoidal path projected onto the floor, and walking along a real or
projected horizontal ladder with irregularly positioned rungs (see Sup-
plementary Materials and Methods).
Data acquisition and analysis
Procedures to record kinematics, kinetics, and muscle activity were
detailed previously (27) (see Supplementary Materials and Methods).
For locomotion, 140 parameters were computed automatically from
kinematic and muscle activity recordings (table S1) according to pub-
lished methods (22, 27, 52, 53). Clinical reports were generated auto-
matically for each set of trials (database S1). For standing, 15 classic
parameters were calculated (table S1). Locomotor performance was
evaluated using a PCA (22, 52, 53), which is summarized in fig. S3
and described in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Statistical analysis
All data are reported as means ± SEM, unless specified otherwise. The
nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test or the Wilcoxon signed-rank
test was used to compare two unpaired, respectively paired conditions.
Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare subject’s gait cycles in sev-
eral conditions. Two-way ANOVA or its nonparametric equivalent,
Friedman test, was used to compare subjects and conditions (Anderson-
Darling test was used to evaluate normal distribution). Post hoc compar-
isons were performed using the Tukey-Kramer test when appropriate.
Statistical tests are specified in the legends of figures.
