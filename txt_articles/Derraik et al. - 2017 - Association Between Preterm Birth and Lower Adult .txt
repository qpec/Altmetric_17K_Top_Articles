We examined whether being born preterm was associated with changes in adult anthropometry in women.
We assessed data on 201,382 women (born in 1973–1988) from the Swedish Birth Register. The mean age
was 26.0 years. Of the women in our cohort, 663 were born very preterm (<32 weeks of gestation), 8,247 were
born moderately preterm (at least 32 weeks but <37 weeks), and 192,472 were born at term (37–41 weeks).
Subgroup analyses were carried out among siblings and also after adjustment for maternal anthropometric data.
Statistical tests were 2-sided. Decreasing gestational age was associated with lower height (−1.1 mm per week
of gestation; P < 0.0001), so that women who were born very preterm were on average 12 mm shorter than
women who were born moderately preterm (P < 0.0001) and 17 mm shorter than women born at term (P < 0.0001).
Compared with women who were born at term, those who were born very preterm had 2.9 times higher odds of
short stature (<155.4 cm), and those born moderately preterm had 1.43 times higher odds. Subgroup analyses
showed no differences between women born moderately preterm and those born at term but accentuated differ-
ences from women born very preterm. Among siblings (n = 2,388), very preterm women were 23 mm shorter
than those born at term (P = 0.003), with a 20-mm difference observed in subgroup analyses (n = 27,395) that
were adjusted for maternal stature (P < 0.001). A shorter final height was associated with decreasing gesta-
tional age, and this association was particularly marked in women born very preterm.

It has been estimated that 9.6% (1) to 11.1% (2) of all
babies worldwide are born preterm (<37 weeks of gesta-
tion). However, rates vary considerably, from approxi-
mately 6% in Sweden to 18% in Malawi (2).
Preterm birth is a major cause of neonatal morbidity
and mortality, particularly in poor countries (3). Further,
there is increasing evidence of adverse long-term out-
comes from preterm birth in children and adults (4–11).
Prepubertal children who were born preterm have been
shown to have reduced insulin sensitivity compared with
those born at term (4). Adults who were born preterm are
at a higher risk of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, par-
ticularly increased adiposity, lower insulin sensitivity, and
higher blood pressure (6–11).
Preterm birth also appears to alter the endocrine regula-
tion of postnatal growth in childhood and adolescence, and
preterm children have been shown to be shorter and to
weigh less than term controls throughout childhood (5, 12).
However, data regarding final adult height in preterm survivors
are scarce, particularly for women. In the present study, we
examined a large cohort of Swedish women assessed early
in pregnancy to evaluate whether preterm birth was associ-
ated with changes in adult anthropometric characteristics.
METHODS
This study was approved by the Regional Ethical
Review Board in Uppsala. The Swedish Birth Register con-
tains data on more than 99% of births in Sweden, and for
the study period, it had a low error rate for the main para-
meters of relevance, such as birthweight, date of last men-
strual period, birth order, and classification as singleton or
multiple birth (13). Information is prospectively collected

 during pregnancy starting at the first antenatal visit and sub-
sequently forwarded to the Birth Register. In this study, we
examined data recorded during the first antenatal visit
(mostly at 10–12 weeks of gestation) on 303,301 singleton
women who were born in 1973–1988 in Sweden, gave birth
in 1991–2009, and were 18 years of age or older. For women
with 2 or more pregnancies in the study period, we included
data from the first recorded pregnancy only. Exclusion crite-
ria were non-Nordic ethnicity, extremely short stature
(≤130 cm), being born small for gestational age (SGA; <−2
standard-deviation scores below the Swedish population
mean for birthweight and/or birth length (14)), presence of
congenital malformations (International Classification of
Disease, Ninth Revision, codes 740–759 and International
Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision, codes Q0–Q99),
and postterm birth (≥42 weeks of gestation). In addition,
potential participants were only included if also born to a sin-
gleton mother who was 18 years of age or older at the first
antenatal visit.
Anthropometric data were available for 268,208 women,
but 33,724 women were either born postterm or lacked data
on gestational age. A further 33,102 women were excluded
for failing to meet inclusion criteria. Thus, the final study
population comprised 201,382 women: 663 who were born
very preterm (<32 weeks of gestation), 8,247 who were
born moderately preterm (at least 32 weeks but <37 weeks
of gestation), and 192,472 who were born at term (37–41
weeks of gestation). The distribution of participants accord-
ing to gestational age is shown in Web Table 1 (available at
http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/), illustrating the comparatively
sparse number of women born at the lower end of the gesta-
tional age spectrum.
Weight and height were measured, although height was
self-reported in some cases. Gestational ages of the women
at their births (extracted from the Swedish Birth Register)
were estimated from the date of the mothers’ last menstrual
periods for the majority of participants; otherwise, estimates
were based on ultrasound scans. Short stature was defined
as height less than −2 standard-deviation scores below the
study population mean (<155.4 cm). Overweight was defined
as body mass index (BMI; weight in kilograms divided by
height in meters squared) of 25 or higher; obese was defined
as a BMI of 30 or higher.
Statistical analyses
Data were compared using general linear regression
models in which we included maternal identification code
as a random factor to identify sibling clusters. Continuous
associations with gestational age were evaluated, but non-
linear associations were not explored. We performed strati-
fied analyses to compare the 3 groups (women born very
preterm, moderately preterm, and at term). Logistic regres-
sion models were run to evaluate binary outcomes (i.e.,
likelihood of short stature, overweight, or obesity).
Stratified analyses were also run among siblings. For these
analyses, we only included those groups of siblings with dis-
cordant gestational ages, that is, those in which at least 1 sib-
ling was born at term and at least 1 other was moderately or
very preterm.
We ran models that included confounding factors that are
known to affect adult anthropometric characteristics, including
age (15) and birth order (16), as well as year of birth to account
for population-wide secular trends. However, because the
adjusted and unadjusted results were nearly identical, only
the unadjusted results are provided. The exceptions were
models run within a subgroup of participants with available
maternal anthropometric data; for these models, we provided
the results after adjustment for the respective maternal
parameter.
Analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS
Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina). All tests were 2-
tailed, with a significance level maintained at 5%. Where
applicable, results are expressed as odds ratios or β coeffi-
cients with the associated 95% confidence intervals.
RESULTS
The women in our study cohort had a mean age of 26.0
years (range, 18–36 years). Lower gestational age was
associated with shorter stature (measured in centimeters)
among Swedish women (β = 0.113, 95% confidence in-
terval: 0.096, 0.129; P < 0.0001). Thus, there was a pro-
gressive height reduction with decreasing gestational age
(Figure 1), equating to an approximate 1.1-mm decrease in
adult height for every 1 week decrease in gestational age
across the spectrum. As a result, women who were born
very preterm were on average 12 mm shorter than those
born moderately preterm (P < 0.0001) and 17 mm shorter
than those born at term (P < 0.0001; Table 1). In addition,
moderately preterm women were 5 mm shorter than those
born at term (P < 0.0001; Table 1).
For every 1-week decrease in gestational age, the odds
ratio of having short stature in adulthood was 1.10

 higher (95% confidence interval: 1.08, 1.12; P < 0.0001).
Consequently, compared with women born at term, those
born very preterm had 2.94 times higher odds of short
stature in adulthood (P < 0.0001) and those born moder-
ately preterm had 1.43 times higher odds (P < 0.0001;
Web Table 2).
Lower gestational age was also associated with lower
weight (β = 0.076, 95% confidence interval: 0.040, 0.113;
P < 0.0001) but not with changes in BMI (P = 0.36).
Women born very preterm were 1.89 kg lighter than those
born moderately preterm (P < 0.001) and 1.84 kg lighter
than those born at term (P < 0.001) (Table 1). On average,
moderately preterm women had a BMI that was 0.15 higher
than did women born at term (P = 0.006; Table 1). Further,
there were increased odds of overweight and obesity in the
moderately preterm group (Web Table 2).
Maternal anthropometric characteristics
We also analyzed data from a subgroup of 27,395 women
for whom we had maternal anthropometric information.
In this group, there was an attenuated association between
gestational age and adult stature (β = 0.063, 95% confi-
dence interval: 0.022, 0.103; P = 0.002); that is, there
was a 0.6-mm decrease in adult height per each 1-week
decrease in gestational age. However, stratified analyses
showed that although adjustment for maternal stature elim-
inated the difference between women born moderately
preterm and those born at term (2 mm; P = 0.21), there
was a more marked difference between women born very
preterm and the others (Table 1). As a result, women born
very preterm were 18 mm shorter than those born moder-
ately preterm (P = 0.002) and 20 mm shorter than those
born at term (P < 0.001) (Table 1).
Siblings
The above findings were corroborated by sibling analy-
ses (Table 2). In this group (n = 2,388), there were no dif-
ferences between women born moderately preterm and
those born at term (P = 0.62; Table 2). However, women
born very preterm were 24 mm shorter than women born
moderately preterm (P = 0.002) and 23 mm shorter than
those born at term (P = 0.003; Table 2). The analyses
among siblings and those adjusted for maternal anthropo-
metric data yielded no significant differences in weight or
BMI between groups (Tables 1 and 2).
DISCUSSION
We observed that among Swedish women, height was
shorter in women born at lower gestational ages so that the
odds of short stature were nearly 3-fold greater in women
born very preterm compared with those born at term.
However, analyses among siblings and those adjusted for
maternal stature showed that lower height was only
observed among women born very preterm.

 To our knowledge, this present study is the first aimed at
specifically evaluating the association between preterm
birth and final height in a large female population. The
large data set also allowed for a more intricate assessment
of adult height across the gestational age range in women.
Previously, most studies have been focused on persons
who were born preterm and had very low birth weights
(rather than on assessing the effects of gestational age per
se). In a prospective study in Australia, Roberts et al. (12)
followed a cohort of infants born extremely preterm (<28
weeks of gestation) until 18 years of age and observed a
lower z score for height in this group (−0.73) compared
with term controls. Similar to our findings, results from
studies of male conscripts in Sweden and Norway have
indicated that mean height at conscription increased with
gestational age until term (17, 18). In the Swedish study,
the risk of adult short stature (<166.3 cm) was nearly 3-
fold higher in males born very preterm (<32 weeks of ges-
tation) compared with those born at term (17). Data on
women are scarce, but in a recent small study in Finland
of 92 adults at 25 years of age, researchers observed that
women born preterm and of very low birth weight were
on average 39 mm shorter than those born at term (19).
Investigators in a Swedish studied examined adult stature
at first antenatal visit in association with SGA birth and
found conflicting results (20); they observed that gesta-
tional age had little impact on final height, but on the other
hand, the adjusted odds ratio of short stature in preterm
women was 1.71 times greater than that of women born at
37–42 weeks of gestation (20). However, interpretation of
the findings from the Finnish and Swedish studies is hin-
dered by the inclusion of a large proportion of participants
born SGA.
A strength of our study was that we were able to exam-
ine the associations between maternal anthropometric and
familial characteristics on offspring outcomes. For exam-
ple, not only does maternal height have a direct genetic
effect on offspring height, but shorter mothers are also
more likely to give birth to a preterm child (21), which
confounds the association between preterm birth and adult
stature. Importantly, our analyses among siblings allowed
us to examine possible genetic effects while also account-
ing to some extent for possible environmental effects
within individual families. Results from both analyses
indicated that a long-term association with height seems
to be particularly marked among women born at less
than 32 weeks of gestation. To put the 23-mm difference
observed between very preterm and term siblings in per-
spective, women who were born during the 1959–1961
Chinese Famine (and exposed to undernutrition early in
childhood) experienced a reduction in adult height of
17 mm (22).
There is also a lack of data on adult body composition in
association with gestational age at birth because investiga-
tions have similarly been focused on those born of very
low birth weight (11). Here, we observed differences in the
risk of overweight among the 2 preterm groups, which sug-
gests that the factors underpinning the previously observed
increase in adiposity in adults born preterm (7) may differ
in those born at less than 32 weeks of gestation compared
to those born moderately preterm.
This study is likely to be robust because of the evalua-
tion of a very large and relatively homogenous cohort. For
example, we excluded women born SGA, which is a
known risk factor for adult short stature in women (20).
However, this could have introduced some bias because
very preterm infants born SGA are more likely to be
misclassified as appropriate for gestational age (23). The
present study has other limitations that need to be taken
into account. Our analyses of siblings groups and those
adjusted for maternal anthropometric data need to be in-
terpreted with caution in light of the reduced number of
included participants who were born very preterm. Our
findings cannot be necessarily extrapolated to men because
of commonly observed sexual dimorphism in association
with early life programming (24), including preterm birth
(7). Our cohort was comprised solely of Nordic women, so
our data may not be applicable to other ethnic groups. The

Lower Adult Height in Women Born Preterm

 proportion of women born preterm for whom anthropo-
metric data were missing was lower than that of women
born at term, which could have theoretically introduced
some bias. For most women, gestational age was estimated
based on the date of the mother’s last menstrual period,
which is not as precise as ultrasound scans but is still a rel-
atively accurate way to differentiate between preterm and
term births (25, 26). Although weight and BMI appear to
change little in the first trimester of pregnancy (27), these
parameters do not necessarily represent weight and BMI
prior to pregnancy.
In summary, we observed a progressive reduction in final
height with decreasing gestational age among Swedish
women. However, associations with stature appeared to
occur mostly among women born at less than 32 weeks of
gestation. These women were 17 to 24 mm shorter and had
nearly 3-fold greater odds of adult short stature than did
those born at term. Our findings indicate that the long-term
associations with height and risk of overweight vary ac-
cording to the severity of prematurity, which requires fur-
ther investigation. Lastly, because our data cannot be
readily applied to men, it would be of interest to ascertain
whether there are contrasting long-term effects of preterm
birth on anthropometric characteristics among adult men.
