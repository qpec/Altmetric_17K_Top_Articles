in the Intensive Care Unit
Hayley B. Gershengorn, MD; Damon C. Scales, MD, PhD; Andrew Kramer, PhD; Hannah Wunsch, MD, MSc
IMPORTANCE Little is known about the timing of extubations for patients in the intensive care
unit (ICU) who undergo mechanical ventilation (MV) or whether overnight extubation is safe.
OBJECTIVES To describe the frequency of overnight extubations and assess the association
between overnight extubations and clinical outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study included adults (aged
�18 years) undergoing MV performed in US ICUs as part of the Project IMPACT database from
October 1, 2000, to March 29, 2009. Data were analyzed from January 1, 2015, to July 5, 2016.
EXPOSURE Overnight extubation defined as occurring from 7 PM to 6:59 AM.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Multilevel multivariable regression analyses (clustered by
individual ICU) were used to identify factors associated with overnight extubation.
Propensity-matched pairs were created of patients undergoing overnight vs daytime
extubation (separately for patients with MV duration <12 and �12 hours). Outcomes,
including frequency of reintubation in the ICU, ICU and hospital mortality, and ICU and
hospital length of stay (LOS), were assessed using χ2 and Mann-Whitney tests.
RESULTS The cohort consisted of 97 844 patients (40.8% men; 59.2% women; mean [SD]
age, 58.3 [17.9] years) across 165 ICUs. Of these, 20.1% of patients underwent overnight
extubation and the percentage decreased over time (23.3% in 2000-2001 vs 18.8% in 2009;
P = .001). After multivariable adjustment, duration of MV of less than 12 hours had the
greatest association with overnight extubation (compared with 12 hours to <1 day: adjusted
odds ratio [AOR], 0.20 [95% CI, 0.19-0.21]; 1 to <2 days: AOR, 0.26 [95% CI, 0.24-0.28]; 2 to
<7 days: AOR, 0.22 [95% CI, 0.21-0.24]; and �7 days: AOR, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.22-0.26]). In all,
4518 propensity-matched pairs had MV duration of less than 12 hours and 5761 had MV
duration of at least 12 hours. For MV duration of less than 12 hours, reintubation rates were
similar for overnight and daytime extubations (5.9% and 5.6%, respectively; P = .50), but
mortality was increased for patients undergoing overnight extubation (ICU, 5.6% vs 4.6%,
P = .03; hospital, 8.3% vs 7.0%, P = .01). The ICU LOS was shorter for overnight vs daytime
extubations (median [interquartile range], 1.1 [0.8-2.3] vs 1.4 [0.9-2.5] days; P < .001), and
hospital LOS was similar (median [interquartile range], 7.0 [4.0-12.0] vs 7.0 [3.0-12.0] days;
P = .03). Patients with MV duration of at least 12 hours who underwent overnight extubation
had more frequent reintubation in the ICU (14.6% vs 12.4%; P < .001) and higher mortality in
the ICU (11.2% vs 6.1%; P < .001) and in the hospital (16.0% vs 11.1%; P < .001), with no
differences in LOS.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Approximately one-fifth of patients with MV in US ICUs
undergo overnight extubation. These patients have higher rates of ICU and hospital mortality
than patients undergoing extubation during the daytime. Further studies are needed to
understand why overnight extubation results in poorer outcomes.

M
echanical ventilation (MV) for acute respiratory fail-
ure is frequent in US intensive care units (ICUs).1 Me-
chanical ventilation is associated with significant
morbidity—pneumonia, weakness, and delirium—that in-
creases with MV duration. Therefore, extubation as soon as pa-
tients are clinically ready may be beneficial, regardless of the
time of day. However, major planned events in the ICU, such
as elective extubations, traditionally have taken place during
the day, when staffing is optimal.
Very little is known about the frequency, safety, or effec-
tiveness of overnight extubations. With the addition of in-
house intensivists 24 hours per day in some ICUs and ex-
pandedtelemedicinecoverage,ICUphysicianstaffingovernight
has increased.2-6 Whether overnight extubations have in-
creased over time and may now be commonplace is un-
known. A single-center study7 assessing reintubation and mor-
tality rates associated with overnight extubations found no
differenceinoutcomesforpatientsundergoingovernightcom-
pared with daytime extubations. However, four-fifths of the
nocturnal extubations in that study occurred in patients who
underwentcardiothoracicsurgery;whetherthesefindingsgen-
eralize to other patient types or hospitals is unknown.
To address this uncertainty, we conducted a retrospective
cohort study of adults with MV admitted to US ICUs. We hy-
pothesized that (1) extubations are currently performed pri-
marily during daytime hours across most US ICUs and (2) over-
night extubations are associated with worse clinical outcomes.
Methods
Study Design
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients in US
ICUs using the Project IMPACT database from October 1, 2000,
to March 29, 2009.8 The institutional review board of Albert
Einstein College of Medicine exempted this retrospective re-
view from ethical approval and informed consent.
Hospitals participating in Project IMPACT were diverse in
size and location but tended to be larger and more urban than
general-population hospitals. Participation was voluntary and
the ICUs paid for the service. Information was collected by on-
sitedatacollectorswhoweretrainedandcertifiedtoensurestan-
dardization in data definitions and entry. Data were collected
from all consecutive admissions to each ICU or from a random
sample of admissions. Sites using the latter method collected
information on 50% or 75% of all patients; the percentage was
determined quarterly before data collection commenced.
Our cohort consisted of adults (≥18 years of age) undergo-
ing MV who were admitted to an ICU participating in Project
IMPACT. Only the first episode of MV during the first ICU stay
was included for each patient. Patients were excluded if they
died, received a tracheostomy, or had any limitations placed
on their care (eg, orders for no cardiopulmonary resuscita-
tion and/or to withhold or withdraw therapy) before a first ex-
tubation attempt. Data on the timing of the initiation and ces-
sation of MV were available by hour and minute.
We defined an extubation as the discontinuation of MV
in the absence of death. For our primary analysis, overnight
extubation was defined as occurring from 7 PM to 6:59 AM.7 Re-
intubation was defined as the resumption of MV after an ex-
tubation event.
For our analysis assessing the association of overnight ex-
tubation with outcomes, our primary outcome was reintuba-
tion occurring at any point during the initial ICU stay and fur-
ther classified as occurring within the first 24, 48, or 96 hours
after extubation. As secondary outcomes, we assessed ICU and
hospital mortality and ICU and hospital lengths of stay (LOSs).
Statistical Methods
Data were analyzed from January 1, 2015, to July 5, 2016. We
used standard summary statistics to describe the rates of ex-
tubation by hour of day across all patients in the cohort and
in subgroups stratified by ICU type (medical, surgical, mixed
medical-surgical, and other), admission type (medical, elec-
tive surgical, and emergent surgical), location before ICU ar-
rival (emergency department, operating room or postanesthe-
sia care unit, ward, stepdown or telemetry, and other), and
duration of MV before an extubation attempt. We compared
the characteristics of patients undergoing daytime and over-
night extubations using unpaired, 2-tailed t tests and χ2 tests
as appropriate. Finally, we constructed a multilevel multivari-
able logistic regression model (clustered by individual ICU) to
identify factors independently associated with overnight ex-
tubation; all available patient and ICU or hospital character-
istics were included as independent variables. Factors of spe-
cific interest in this analysis included year of ICU admission
and on-site overnight coverage (intensivist vs other clinician
vs none). Restricted cubic splines with 4 knots (placed using
the Harrell recommended percentiles) were used to model age
and illness severity (mortality probability model at ICU admis-
sion [MPM0-III])9; ICU bed number and duration of MV were
stratified into relevant categories.
Given our observation that patients with MV duration of
less than 12 hours had a significantly higher frequency of over-
night extubations than patients with all other durations of MV,
we performed post hoc stratification of all analyses evaluat-
ing time of extubation and outcomes by duration of MV; to do
so, we created the following 2 subcohorts: (1) patients with MV
duration of less than 12 hours and (2) patients with MV dura-
tion of at least 12 hours. We compared the patient and ICU or
hospital characteristics of both subcohorts using unpaired,
2-tailed t tests and χ2 tests as appropriate.
Key Points
Questions How common are overnight extubations in the
intensive care unit and are they associated with worse outcomes
for critically ill patients?
Findings In this cohort study of 97 844 patients in US intensive
care units who have undergone mechanical ventilation (MV),
20.1% underwent overnight extubation. Overnight extubation was
associated with significantly higher hospital mortality compared
with daytime extubation.
Meaning Overnight extubation is not common and is associated
with worse outcomes for critically ill patients.

To evaluate the association of overnight extubations and
outcomes, we used a propensity score–matching strategy to
create pairs of patients (one with a daytime extubation and one
with an overnight extubation) with similar propensity to re-
ceive overnight extubation. A propensity score is a probabi-
listic measure that reflects the propensity of a patient, based
on other characteristics, in this instance to undergo extuba-
tion overnight. This score is not a marker of whether particu-
lar patients underwent overnight extubation but rather
whether they were likely to have undergone overnight extu-
bation given their characteristics. To create the propensity
score for overnight extubation (dependent variable), we used
a multivariable logistic regression that included all available
patient-level data (the same patient characteristic variables
as in the above multilevel model except that duration of MV
was modeled using restricted cubic splines, with 4 knots
using the Harrell recommended percentiles)10-12; the indi-
vidual ICU to which each patient was admitted was included
as a fixed effect.13,14 The success of the propensity score was
determined by its ability to balance independent covariates
between the patients who underwent overnight extubation
and those who did not. This covariate balance was assessed
using standard mean differences.15 One-to-one nearest
neighbor–matching restricting pairs to have similar propensi-
ties to be extubated overnight were then used to create quasi-
cases (those who underwent overnight extubation) and
quasi-controls (those who underwent daytime extubation);
matching was performed without replacement (controls
could only be used once). The ICUs with fewer than 50
patients with, separately, MV duration of less than 12 and at
least 12 hours, were excluded.
Rates of reintubation (the primary outcome) and each of
our secondary outcomes were compared between the groups
of matched pairs using χ2 tests, unpaired, 2-tailed t tests, and
Wilcoxon rank sum tests as appropriate. We also assessed LOS
using the time to ICU or hospital discharge method to ac-
countforthecompetingriskforICUorhospitaldeath.Allanaly-
ses were repeated for patient subgroups stratified by patient
type, ICU type, and overnight on-site clinician.
Finally, we performed 4 types of sensitivity analyses.
First, we conducted a sensitivity analysis in which we rede-
fined overnight extubation as occurring from midnight to 4:59
AM (the definition for daytime extubation remained 7 AM to
6:59 PM). Second, we conducted a pair of analyses aimed at
minimizing confounding from palliative extubations (those
performed for the purpose of comfort and without expecta-
tion for patient survival); to do so, we restricted each subco-
hort to patients who survived (1) to hospital discharge and,
separately, (2) at least 24 hours after extubation. Third, we
conducted an analysis intended to minimize confounding
from unplanned extubations; to do so, we excluded patients
who underwent reintubation within the first hour after extu-
bation (assuming that this would occur more commonly with
unplanned extubations). Fourth, we used a separate clinical
data set, APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health
Evaluation) Outcomes, which contains data from more than 1
million US ICU admissions.16 This data set is more current
(January 7, 2010, to March 26, 2013), yet was not chosen for
our primary cohort because it does not contain information
on tracheostomies or limitations in care.
We compared characteristics and outcomes within
APACHE Outcomes between patients undergoing overnight
and daytime extubations using χ2 tests, unpaired, 2-tailed
t tests, and Wilcoxon rank sum tests as appropriate. The asso-
ciation of outcome with overnight extubation was then
assessed using the same propensity-matching strategy as pre-
viously used for Project IMPACT. All statistical analyses were
performed using STATA software (version 13; StataCorp),
Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp), and SAS (version 9.4; SAS
Institute Inc).
Results
After exclusions (eFigure 1 in the Supplement), the primary
cohort consisted of 97 844 adults with MV (40.8% men;
59.2% women; mean [SD] age, 58.3 [17.9] years) admitted to
one of 165 US ICUs (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Cohort
ICUs varied by type (84 mixed medical-surgical [50.9%], 30
medical [18.2%], and 40 surgical [24.2%], 7 other [4.2%],
and 4 unknown [2.4%]), size, and geographic region.
On-site intensivists were present overnight in 44 ICUs
(26.7%).
Factors Associated With Overnight Extubation
Approximatelyone-fifth(20.1%)ofthecohortunderwentover-
night extubation (from 7 PM to 6:59 AM) (Figure 1). Compared
with patients undergoing daytime extubations, those under-
going overnight extubation had more commonly undergone
elective surgery (46.8% vs 24.8%; P < .001), were admitted to
the ICU from the operating room or postanesthesia care unit
(63.5% vs 40.2%; P < .001), and had a duration of MV of less
than 12 hours (57.1% vs 19.8%; P < .001) (Table 1). Patients un-
dergoing overnight extubation more commonly had a cardio-
vascular diagnosis at admission (51.8% vs 25.4%; P < .001) and
less commonly had a respiratory or thoracic diagnosis at ad-
mission (16.2% vs 30.1%; P < .001). Overnight extubations de-
creased over time, with 23.3% of patients undergoing over-
nightextubationin2000to2001comparedwith18.8%in2009
(P = .001) (eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
Among patients with MV duration of less than 12 hours,
42.1% underwent overnight extubation vs only 11.9% of pa-
tients with MV duration of at least 12 hours (eFigure 3 in the
Supplement).Daytimeextubationsweremorecommonforpa-
tients from all locations before ICU admission, for all patient
types, and for those admitted to all ICU types (eFigure 4 in the
Supplement).
After multivariable adjustment, the factor with the
greatest association with overnight extubation was duration
of MV (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] for 12 hours to less than 1
day, 0.20 [95% CI, 0.19-0.21]; AOR for 1 to less than 2 days,
0.26 [95% CI, 0.24-0.28]; AOR for 2 to less than 7 days, 0.22
[95% CI, 0.21-0.24]; and AOR for 7 or more days, 0.24 [95%
CI, 0.22-0.26]) compared with the reference MV duration of
less than 12 hours (P < .001) (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
The odds of overnight extubation decreased with year of ICU

2008, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.57-0.74]; and AOR for 2009, 0.68
[95% CI, 0.48-0.96]) compared with reference year 2000 to
2001 (P ≤ .03) and was lower when a clinician other than an
intensivist was on-site overnight (AOR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.72-
0.91; P = .001).
Association of Overnight Extubation With Outcomes
We compared patients who were and were not eligible for pro-
pensity matching based on data completeness (eTable 3 in the
Supplement). Of 26 679 patients (27.3%) who had MV dura-
tion of less than 12 hours (eTable 4 in the Supplement), we cre-
ated 4518 propensity-matched pairs (one patient with over-
night extubation and the other with daytime extubation).
Patients were well matched on all patient- and ICU-level char-
acteristics (eTable 5 in the Supplement). Rates of reintuba-
tionweresimilarwhetherpatientsunderwentovernightorday-
time extubation (P ≥ .48) (Table 2); for patients with overnight
extubation, ICU mortality (5.6% vs 4.6%; P = .03) and hospi-
tal mortality (8.3% vs 7.0%; P = .01) were increased. The ICU
LOS was slightly shorter for patients undergoing overnight vs
daytime extubation (median [interquartile range], 1.1 [0.8-
2.3] vs 1.4 [0.9-2.5] days; P < .001) and hospital LOS was simi-
lar (median [interquartile range], 7.0 [4.0-12.0] vs 7.0 [3.0-
12.0] days; P = .03) (Table 2 and eFigure 5 in the Supplement).
From 71 165 patients (72.7%) with MV duration of at least
12 hours, we created 5761 propensity-matched pairs, also well
matched on characteristics (eTable 5 in the Supplement). Rates
of reintubation were higher for patients undergoing over-
night extubation (14.6% vs 12.4%; P < .001) (Table 2). Mortal-
ity was also significantly higher for patients undergoing over-
nightvsdaytimeextubationintheICU(11.2%vs6.1%;P < .001)
and in the hospital (16.0% vs 11.1%; P < .001). Length of ICU
and hospital stays did not differ (Table 2 and eFigure 5 in the
Supplement).
No patient subgroup was evaluated in which overnight ex-
tubation was associated with a reduction in the rates of rein-
tubation or mortality (Figure 2). Length of ICU stay was shorter
for surgical patients undergoing overnight extubation with
shortMVduration(<12hours),butnodifferentforpatientswith
longer MV duration (≥12 hours) (Table 3).
Our results were robust to several sensitivity analyses
(eFigure 6 and eTable 6 in the Supplement give APACHE
Outcomes cohort details). Specifically, overnight extubation
was associated with higher mortality for all patients (and
higher rates of reintubation for patients with MV duration
≥12 hours) when the overnight cohort was limited to extuba-
tions that occurred only from midnight to 4:59 AM (eFigure 7
in the Supplement). Similarly, in the APACHE Outcomes
cohort, mortality was significantly higher in patients with
MV duration of at least 12 hours who underwent overnight
extubation. Notably, in survivor cohorts—designed to limit
confounding by palliative extubation—rates of reintubation
were significantly higher in patients with MV duration of at
least 12 hours who underwent overnight extubation. In
patients remaining extubated for at least 1 hour (ie, patients
less likely to have had unplanned extubations), ICU and hos-
pital mortality but not reintubation rates were higher for
patients with all MV durations. Length of stay in the ICU but
not the hospital was reduced in the APACHE Outcomes
cohort for surgical patients with short durations of MV
(eTable 7 in the Supplement).
Discussion
Only one-fifth of patients with MV underwent overnight ex-
tubation in US ICUs, and the frequency of this practice de-
creased over time. As anticipated, no clear benefits were as-
sociatedwithovernightextubation.AlthoughICULOS(butnot
hospital LOS) was reduced for surgical patients with short du-
rations of MV (<12 hours), LOS reductions may be affected by
the competing risk for mortality. Overnight extubations were
associated with worse outcomes, that is, higher rates of ICU
and hospital mortality. Moreover, for patients with longer MV
durations (≥12 hours), overnight extubation was also clearly

associated with increased odds of reintubation. These results
are robust across different definitions of overnight and are con-
sistent across many patient subgroups.
In nearly every cohort analyzed, the ORs associated with
overnightextubationforICUandhospitalmortalitywerelarger
than those for reintubation; in many instances, the odds of re-
intubation were not even statistically significantly increased
for patients undergoing overnight extubation, whereas their
odds of mortality were significantly higher. This phenom-
enon of dying without reintubation has more than 1 possible
explanation. First, patients may have a cardiopulmonary ar-
rest while extubated and die before reintubation. However,
the incidence of in-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest in the
United States is low (2.85 per 1000 hospital admissions)17;

thus, the contribution of patients who died as a result of car-
diopulmonary arrest without reintubation is likely to be quite
small. Second, patients may have goals of care limitations put
in place after their initial extubation that preclude reintuba-
tion at the time of recurrent respiratory failure and resultant
death. Our sensitivity analysis using APACHE Outcomes by
necessity included more patients receiving potentially pallia-
tive extubations (because we could not identify them in this
cohort), and we saw a greater magnitude of association
between overnight extubations and mortality in this group,
lending support to this theory. To our knowledge, no pub-
lished study has evaluated the time of day of palliative extu-
bations, yet these extubations might occur more commonly
overnight when family and friends may be more able to be at
the bedside (because family and caregivers are known to
value being present at the time of death of patients in the

Tests for interaction between overnight extubation and subgroups depicted for
each outcome were assessed using the primary propensity-matched cohorts (all
patients with mechanical ventilation [MV] duration <12 h and, separately, all
patients with MV duration �12 h). No significant interaction (P < .05) was found
between overnight extubation and any subgroup examined for any outcome.

ICU18). In a retrospective study, we cannot clearly identify all
patients in whom limitations on care were in place at the
time of the need for reintubation. Residual confounding due
to this issue, therefore, likely explains the differences we
observe in the odds of reintubation and mortality associated
with overnight extubation.
We had hypothesized that increases in overnight in-
house intensivist staffing over time2,3 would translate into a
greater likelihood of overnight extubations occurring in the
later years in our study. Although we found an increased like-
lihood of overnight extubation in ICUs with intensivists on-
site overnight (compared with other clinicians), the likeli-
hood of overnight extubation decreased with ICU admission
year. In theory, the value added of in-house intensivists might
be viewed as ensuring good care practices 24 hours a day in
the ICU.19,20 However, this drive for more active manage-
ment overnight may be countered by a recognition that dis-
ruption of patients’sleep-wake cycles is likely harmful21,22 and
a move toward minimizing activities overnight that can wait
until the morning.23
Our findings are not consistent with, what is to our knowl-
edge, the only other published study7 on the topic of timing

of extubations in which rates of reintubation within 24 hours
were lower (AOR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-0.9; P = .01) and mortality
rateswerenotstatisticallysignificantlydifferent(AOR,0.6;95%
CI, 0.3-1.0; P = .06) for patients undergoing overnight extu-
bation. Several plausible reasons exist for these observed dif-
ferences. First, the study by Tischenkel et al7 included pa-
tientsfromasingleacademicmedicalcenterinwhichovernight
extubations were more common than in other ICUs (30.1% of
allextubationsvs20.1%inourcohort).Systemsmaybeinplace
in that institution that are not present in others to make this
practice safer. Second, more than half of the patients in the
study by Tischenkel et al7 were admitted to a cardiac surgical
ICU, and those patients represented a significant proportion
of patients undergoing overnight extubation (81.8%). In con-
trast, our cohort included only 4 cardiac surgical ICUs (2.4%
of the 165 ICUs in the cohort). For postoperative patients in the
cardiac surgical ICU for whom recommendations are to extu-
bate early after surgery,24 overnight extubation might be ad-
vantageous rather than waiting until the next morning. Fi-
nally, Tischenkel et al7 excluded patients who had palliative
extubations and adjusted for the extubation being un-
planned. Our study is limited by the fact that we were unable
to account for unplanned extubations.
Other limitations of our study include its retrospective na-
ture, which restricts our ability to investigate why the time of
day for extubation was chosen. More detail on this issue would
help to better define our cohort and refine our analyses. More-
over, these data sets do not provide information on the rea-
son for MV, thus limiting our ability to stratify patients based
on indication. In addition, Project IMPACT—chosen as our pri-
mary data set because it has detailed information about care
limitations, tracheostomy use, and staffing—ended data col-
lection in 2009, and practices may have changed since then,
which may mediate the association of overnight extubations
and outcomes. However, the fact that our results are robust
to sensitivity analyses using APACHE Outcomes (which is less
detailedbutcontainsdatathrough2013)alleviatesmuchofthis
concern. In addition, patients were excluded from severity of
illness (MPM0-III) calculation and, thus, analyses of out-
comes for patients who were extubated overnight who under-
went cardiac surgery or transplant or were admitted with acute
myocardial infarction could not be done; therefore, general-
izability of our findings to these groups is limited. We also ex-
cluded patients with orders to limit care before extubation;
however, this method for determining which patients would
receive resuscitation if needed may be insensitive. Finally, we
do not have information pertaining to reintubation events that
occurred after the initial ICU stay. However, we expect that
mostreintubationsrelatedtoaprimaryextubationfailurelikely
occurred during the same ICU admission.
Conclusions
Our study presents, to our knowledge, the first multicenter
evaluation of overnight extubations in the United States and
the association of this practice with clinically meaningful out-
comes.Ourfindingthatovernightextubationisassociatedwith
higher mortality is of great potential clinical import. Al-
though our study cannot prove causality, our findings raise se-
rious concerns about the routine practice of overnight extu-
bation for many patients in the ICU. We must be cautious as
ICUs move to employ more high-level staff at night2-6 and push
for standardization of care throughout all hours of the day. Al-
though overnight extubation may be safe (or even beneficial)
to some patient subgroups not included in our analyses (eg,
those who have had cardiac surgery), for many patients, this
practice may confer harm.

Overnight Extubation in Patients With Mechanical Ventilation
Is It Harmful?
Peter K. Moore, MD; Michael A. Matthay, MD
The timing of extubation in patients with mechanical venti-
lationisconfrontedbyintensivistsandphysiciansintheUnited
States on a daily basis. Theoretically, earlier extubation has the
potential to prevent ventilator-associated complications and
decrease the length of inten-
sive care unit (ICU) and hos-
pital stays. However, over-
night extubation may be
riskier, in part because fewer and less experienced physi-
cians, nurses, and respiratory therapists are available. Al-
though the clinically important question of when to extubate
arises daily in the ICU, current research on the optimal timing
for extubation is insufficient.
In this issue of JAMA Internal Medicine, Gershengorn et al1
report the results of a retrospective cohort study of 97 844
adults who received mechanical ventilation in 165 US hospi-
tals to determine the frequency of overnight extubation and
to investigate whether nighttime extubation was associated
with differences in outcomes. The primary results show that
overnight extubation occurred in 20.1% of patients in this reg-
istry. Using propensity-matched analysis, overnight extuba-
tion was associated with higher odds of ICU mortality (5.6%
vs 4.6% for intubation <12 hours and 11.2% vs 6.1% for intu-
bation ≥12 hours) and hospital mortality (8.3% vs 7.0% for in-
tubation<12hoursand16.0%vs11.1%forintubation≥12hours)
compared with extubation during the day. In addition, pa-
tientswhohadreceivedmechanicalventilationatleast12hours
before extubation had an increased odds of reintubation if ex-
tubated overnight.
This study is the first to report an association between in-
creased mortality and extubation at night. In contrast, only 1
prior study by Tischenkel et al2 addressed this question and
reportedthatpatientswhowereextubatedovernighthadlower
rates of reintubation, with a statistically insignificant de-
crease in mortality. Several important differences between
these2studiesshouldbeemphasized.ThestudybyTischenkel
et al2 was performed at 2 hospitals within a single medical cen-
ter with strict, standardized ventilator weaning and extuba-
tion criteria. Furthermore, most of the participants were car-
diac surgical patients (52% overall and 82% of the night
extubation group). In fact, the lower rate of reintubation and
the decrease in mortality, although insignificant, in the group
extubated at night was lost when the cardiac surgical ICU pa-
tients were removed from the analysis. By contrast, only 2.4%
of the patients included by Gershengorn et al were treated in
a cardiac surgical ICU. Analysis of the findings from these 2
studies raises the possibility that overnight extubation may be
beneficial for certain populations and harmful for others.
The study by Gershengorn et al1 has many strengths. The
study population was derived from a large national database
that includes academic and private ICUs of multiple sizes and
varied geographic location, which improved the generalizabil-
ity of the findings. Given the large number of participants, pro-
pensity-matched pairs could be used in the analysis to reduce
bias. Last, multiple sensitivity analyses were performed in
which the associations between poor outcomes and night-
time extubation were still significant.
However, the use of this large database resulted in limita-
tions related to incomplete information regarding the circum-
stances surrounding extubations. For example, compassion-
ate extubations for patients at the end of life were not captured
by the data set. Conceivably, compassionate extubation may
occur more frequently at night when more family members are
able to be present. The authors anticipated this problem and
incorporated several steps to limit this bias, which could have
skewedtheassociationwithhighermortality.First,theauthors
