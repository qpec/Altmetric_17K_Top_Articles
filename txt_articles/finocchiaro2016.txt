ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND Accurate knowledge of causes of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in athletes and its precipitating factors is
necessary to establish preventative strategies.
OBJECTIVES This study investigated causes of SCD and their association with intensive physical activity in a large
cohort of athletes.
METHODS Between 1994 and 2014, 357 consecutive cases of athletes who died suddenly (mean 29 � 11 years of age,
92% males, 76% Caucasian, 69% competitive) were referred to our cardiac pathology center. All subjects underwent
detailed post-mortem evaluation, including histological analysis by an expert cardiac pathologist. Clinical information
was obtained from referring coroners.
RESULTS Sudden arrhythmic death syndrome (SADS) was the most prevalent cause of death (n ¼ 149 [42%]).
Myocardial disease was detected in 40% of cases, including idiopathic left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and/or
fibrosis (n ¼ 59, 16%); arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) (13%); and hypertrophic cardiomy-
opathy (HCM) (6%). Coronary artery anomalies occurred in 5% of cases. SADS and coronary artery anomalies affected
predominantly young athletes (# 35 years of age), whereas myocardial disease was more common in older individuals.
SCD during intense exertion occurred in 61% of cases; ARVC and left ventricular fibrosis most strongly predicted SCD
during exertion.
CONCLUSIONS Conditions predisposing to SCD in sports demonstrate a significant age predilection. The strong
association of ARVC and left ventricular fibrosis with exercise-induced SCD reinforces the need for early detection
and abstinence from intense exercise. However, almost 40% of athletes die at rest, highlighting the need
for complementary preventive strategies. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2016;67:2108–15) © 2016 by the American College of

S
udden cardiac death (SCD) is a tragic event that
occasionally affects apparently healthy indi-
viduals (1), including young (#35 years of
age) athletes (2–5). A spectrum of cardiac diseases is
implicated in SCD, with variable prevalence depend-
ing
on
the
age
and
other
demographics
of
the
cohort (6). Many reports regarding the causes of
SCD in athletes are limited by the lack of a detailed
post-mortem examination performed by an experi-
enced cardiac pathologist. A recent study comparing
the interpretation of autopsy findings between a
referring pathologist and a specialist cardiac patholo-
gist demonstrated a 40% disparity with respect to
actual cause of death (7).
Knowledge of precise causes and precipitating
factors of SCD may influence national strategies to

(AEDs).
Pre-
participation
screening
with
electrocardiography
(ECG) is useful for detecting quiescent inherited car-
diac diseases, particularly inherited cardiomyopa-
thies, and ion-channelopathies but has limited value
in detecting athletes with coronary artery disease
(CAD). AEDs appear to be more effective in the
termination of arrhythmias in athletes with CAD or
coronary artery anomalies than in athletes with car-
diomyopathy (8,9).
The objective of this study was to investigate the
causes and circumstances of SCD in a large cohort of
athletes, as determined by post-mortem examination
performed by an expert cardiac pathologist.
METHODS
The Cardiac Risk in the Young (CRY) center for cardiac
pathology is located at St. George’s University of
London. The center is led by an expert cardiac
pathologist (M.N.S.) and receives over 400 whole
hearts from cases of SCD across the United Kingdom
annually. General pathologists are likely to refer to
the CRY center when the clinical history is suggestive
of inherited cardiac disease, especially when the
death affects a young or athletic individual or when
the cause of death is uncertain after the initial
autopsy.
STUDY POPULATION. We retrospectively reviewed
cases from a database of 3,684 cases of SCD referred
to the CRY center for cardiac pathology between 1994
and 2014. SCD was defined as death occurring within
12 h of apparent wellbeing. We retrieved a sub-
group of 357 cases (9.7%) of individuals who had
engaged in regular sport activities, defined as >3 h of
organized physical training per week. The majority
(84%) of referrals occurred between 2004 and 2014.
Competitive athletes were defined as those who were
involved in organized sports requiring participation
in regular, formal competition. Circumstances of
death were subdivided broadly into death occurring
during exercise and death during rest or sleep.
POST-MORTEM EXAMINATION. All SCD cases under-
went a full post-mortem evaluation by the local
pathologist. Following the exclusion of extra-cardiac
causes, the heart was sent to our center after writ-
ten consent of the coroner and the family of the
deceased. The local pathologist also performed an
initial cardiac autopsy before referring the heart in
58% of cases. A thorough toxicology screen was
conducted in all cases in accordance with the
usual
investigation
of
sudden
and
unex-
pected
deaths
in
the
United
Kingdom.
Comprehensive macroscopic examination of
the whole heart and histological analysis
were performed in accordance with guide-
lines on “Autopsy practice for sudden death
with likely cardiac pathology” of the Royal
College of Pathologists (10) and the Associa-
tion for European Cardiovascular Pathology
(11). All cardiac structures were systemati-
cally examined. Heart weight was recorded in
grams, and ventricular wall thickness and
internal cavity dimensions were measured at
mid-ventricular level, excluding the papillary
muscles and fat. A minimum of 10 blocks of tissue
were taken for histological analysis as reported pre-
viously (6,7). Sections of myocardium were fixed in
formalin, embedded in paraffin, and stained with
hematoxylin and eosin and with elastic Van Gieson
stain to highlight myocardial fibrosis.
Criteria for defining specific cardiac pathologies
have been previously described (6,12) and are sum-
marized in Table 1. Sudden arrhythmic death syn-
drome (SADS) was a diagnosis of exclusion, defined as
a structurally normal heart with no evident abnor-
mality on macroscopic and histological evaluation
and a negative result for toxicology screening (13–15).
CLINICAL INFORMATION. The referring coroner and
pathologist were asked to complete a questionnaire
regarding the demographics of the deceased, medical
history, family history, cardiac symptoms, nature and
level of physical activity, and exact circumstances of
death. Data were derived from a number of sources
including: interviews with the family of the deceased,
potential witnesses to the SCD, and reports from the
deceased’s family physician. Data were collected
prospectively and stored in an electronic database.
STATISTICAL
ANALYSIS. Statistical
analysis
was
performed using PASW version 18.0 software (PASW,
Inc., Chicago, Illinois). Results are mean � SD for
continuous variables or numbers of cases and per-
centages for categorical variables. Comparison of
groups
was
performed
using
Student
t
test
for
continuous variables with correction for unequal
variance when necessary and chi-square test or Fisher
exact test, as appropriate for categorical variables.
Univariate and multivariate logistic regression ana-
lyses were used to determine the factors associated
with death during exertion. Age, sex, and variables
that were univariately correlated with the dependent
variable were selected and entered into the forward
stepwise multiple regression model.

 RESULTS
CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS. The mean age at death
of the 357 athletes was 29 � 11 years (range: 7 to
67 years; median: 27 years), with a large male pre-
dominance (n ¼ 330, 92%). The average body mass in-
dex and body surface area were 25 � 5 kg/m2 and 2.2 �
0.4 m2, respectively. A significant proportion of in-
dividuals were competitive athletes (n ¼ 245 [69%]),
participating in regular training and competition in
team (n ¼ 155 [43%]) or individual (n ¼ 90 [26%]) sports.
The rest of the cohort (n ¼ 112 [31%]) consisted of
recreational athletes. Sporting disciplines included
running
(n
¼
92
[25%];
40
participating
in
half-marathons and marathons), football (n ¼ 91
[25%]), cycling (n ¼ 30 [8%]), gymnastics (n ¼ 30 [8%]),
swimming (n ¼ 22 [6%]), weightlifting (n ¼ 20 [6%]),
rugby (n ¼ 19 [5%]), tennis (n ¼ 6 [2%]), golf (n ¼ 6 [2%]),
boxing (n ¼ 5 [1%]), and other sports (n ¼ 36 [10%]).
The majority of the athletes were asymptomatic
(n ¼ 288 [81%]). Of the 69 symptomatic athletes (29%),
27 (8%) had palpitations, 20 (6%) had chest pain,
18 (5%) had syncope, and 4 (1%) reported decreased
exercise tolerance. Five patients experienced palpi-
tations due to paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, including
1 in the context of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.
One athlete received a diagnosis of myocarditis 4 years
before death, and 1 athlete was hospitalized 4 months
prior to death for suspected myocarditis. There was a
family history of premature sudden death (defined as
death of a first-degree relative <50 years of age) in
28 cases (8%). The main comorbidities were asthma
(n ¼ 28%, 8%), epilepsy (n ¼ 5, 1%), and treated arterial
hypertension (n ¼ 4, 1%).
CAUSES. The main causes of death are shown in the
Central Illustration. A normal post-mortem indicative
of SADS was the most common finding and accounted
for 149 deaths (42%). Myocardial disease was present
in 130 cases (35%). Among these cases, idiopathic left
ventricular
hypertrophy
(LVH)
and/or
fibrosis
accounted for 59 deaths (16%), followed by arrhyth-
mogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC)
(n ¼ 48 [13%]), and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
(HCM) (n ¼ 23 [6%]). The majority of individuals with
ARVC also demonstrated LV involvement, with 17
cases (35%) exhibiting fibrofatty infiltration of the LV
and 41 cases (85%) showing evidence of left ventric-
ular (LV) fibrosis. Coronary artery pathology occurred
in 7% of cases, with coronary artery anomalies ac-
counting for the majority of the cases.
CAUSES OF DEATH BY AGE AND SEX. The prevalence
of specific cardiac pathologies varied with age (Central
Illustration). SADS was most common in younger cases
and showed a reduced trend with increasing age
(Figure 1). A structurally normal heart was reported in
56% of children and adolescents (<18 years), 44% of
young adults (18 to 35 years of age), and 26% of older
individuals (>35 years of age; p <0.001 comparing <18
and >35 years of age; p ¼ 0.004 comparing 18 to 35
years of age and those >35 years of age). Coronary ar-
tery anomalies were also more prevalent in younger
individuals, accounting for 11% of deaths in children

 examination. Idiopathic fibrosis accounted for 11% of
deaths, ARVC for 7%, and HCM for 4% of the other
deaths. None of the female athletes showed idio-
pathic LVH.
CIRCUMSTANCES OF DEATH. The majority of ath-
letes died during exertion (n ¼ 219 [61%]), including a
small proportion of individuals (n ¼ 14 [4%]) who
died during altercation. Of the 138 subjects who died
at rest, 47 (34%) died during sleep. The age and sex
distributions of athletes who died during exertion
and those of athletes who died at rest were similar,
and only a minority of subjects (8%) had a family
history of sudden death. Patients who died at rest
were more likely to demonstrate a normal heart at
post-mortem examination (Table 2). Conversely, ath-
letes who died during exertion were more likely to
have ARVC (20% vs. 3%, respectively; p < 0.001), LV
fibrosis (39% vs. 22%, respectively; p < 0.001), and
coronary artery anomalies (7% vs. 1%, respectively;
p ¼ 0.01).
Multivariate analysis identified ARVC (hazard ratio
[HR]: 6.01; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.97 to 18.32;
p ¼ 0.001) as the strongest independent predictor of
SCD during exercise, followed by LV fibrosis (HR: 2.11;
95% CI: 1.15 to 3.88; p ¼ 0.01) (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
This study reports on a large number of young
athletes dying suddenly in the United Kingdom for
whom all post-mortem examinations were conducted
by a cardiac pathologist with expertise in conditions
predisposing to SCD. In comparison to a smaller study
published by our group (6), the large sample size of
almost 70% competitive athletes allowed for a greater
degree of certainty relating to the impact of specific
pathologies associated with SCD during intensive
exercise.

 collegiate athletes (16) and young military personnel
(17), a normal heart indicative of a diagnosis of SADS
was present in a significant proportion of athletes. A
structurally normal heart accounted for 42% of the
overall cohort in this study, compared to the 23% we
reported previously (6). Although the high prevalence
of SADS in our cohort may be partly explained by a
referral bias, its high prevalence in U.S. cohorts (31%
in collegiate athletes and 41% in young military
personnel) underscores the importance of inherited
primary arrhythmia syndromes as a major cause of
SCD in athletes (16,17).
Myocardial disease accounted for 40% of cases.
Idiopathic LVH and/or fibrosis and ARVC were the
predominant diagnoses. The significance of idio-
pathic LVH is uncertain. The entity may be an inno-
cent bystander, but the possibility of pathological
LVH as a variant of HCM, cannot be excluded,
particularly in the presence of LV fibrosis (12). Idio-
pathic LVH may also be a trigger for arrhythmia in
individuals
with
underlying
primary
arrhythmia
syndrome. In a recent study by our group, familial
evaluation of victims of SCD with autopsy findings
consistent with idiopathic LVH, identified primary
arrhythmia syndromes in 6 of 13 (46%) families and
probable HCM in only 1 family (12). In such circum-
stances, a false diagnosis of HCM has potentially
significant implications for surviving relatives who
may be subjected to targeted screening for cardio-
myopathy
rather
than
the
extensive
evaluation,
including
pharmacological
provocation
tests,
to
detect primary arrhythmia syndromes (18).
In this study, HCM contributed to only 6% of
deaths. That is in contrast to the established percep-
tion that HCM is the commonest cause of SCD in
athletes (4,19). This may partly reflect the stringent
diagnostic criteria applied by our group, which re-
quires the presence of >20% of myocardial disarray in
at least 2 tissue blocks of 4 cm2 (14). In contrast,
nonspecialist pathologists may attribute exercise-
induced
adaptations
such
as
LVH
to
HCM
(7)
without conducting a detailed histological analysis
of the heart. This probability highlights the impor-
tance that post-mortem examinations in athletes
should be performed by pathologists with a high level
of experience in conditions predisposing to SCD. We
cannot disregard the possibility of selection bias, as
general pathologists may be less inclined to refer
diseases such as HCM to our center if they are confi-
dent about the diagnosis.
An important minority (8%) showed idiopathic
fibrosis. Possible explanations include healed myo-
carditis or incomplete expression of cardiomyopathy.
However,
it
is
also
possible
that
long-standing
intense exercise may be a causal factor. Studies
have previously reported raised serum concentration
of biomarkers of myocyte injury following endurance
events,
an
increased
prevalence
of
myocardial
fibrosis on cardiac magnetic resonance and a higher
burden of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias in vet-
eran endurance athletes (20–22). More than 80% of
athletes died suddenly without warning symptoms,
underscoring
the
possible
limitations
of
cardiac
screening based only on medical history and physical
examination (23).
EFFECT OF AGE. In agreement with previous studies
(6,24), SADS exhibited a significant age predilection.
SADS accounted for more than one-half of all deaths
in children and adolescents, but for only 26% of
deaths in individuals older than 35 years of age. In
contrast, myocardial disease was more prevalent
with advancing age. ARVC, a condition commonly
associated with SCD in young athletes, was rarely
detected
in
children
and
adolescents
(4%)
but
accounted 18% of deaths in individuals >35 years.
Our results are consistent with a large autopsy study
in 200 cases of ARVC (25), where the average age of
death was at 33 years and almost 40% of deaths
occurred
after
age
35.
Interestingly,
ARVC
was
associated with an increased heart weight in 25% of
cases.
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH
AND EXERCISE. As reported previously (4,26), we
demonstrated
that
SCD
in
athletes
occurs
more
frequently during exercise. The strongest predictor
for SCD during exertion was ARVC. Athletes with
ARVC were 6 times more likely to die on exertion
compared to those with other cardiac pathologies

Sudden Death in Athletes
2113
 (92% experienced SCD on the athletic field). LV
fibrosis
was
also
an
independent
predictor
of
exercise-induced
SCD.
Coronary
artery
anomalies
were a rare cause of SCD, but the majority of deaths
occurred during exertion. Although HCM is consid-
ered the leading cause of exercise induced SCD in
athletes, deaths from HCM in our cohort did not show
any predilection for exercise. Our results, however,
should be interpreted with caution given the rela-
tively low numbers of HCM-related deaths in this
study. In agreement with current published reports,
SADS accounted for the majority of deaths at rest
(54%) compared to a third of deaths (34%) during
exertion.
CLINICAL
IMPLICATIONS. Given that almost 40%
of athletes died outside the context of exercise,
including 13% during sleep, it is highly unlikely
that the provision of AEDs in public venues would
have prevented these deaths. Many of the SCDs during
rest were related to SADS and possibly to primary
arrhythmia
syndromes
that
are
often
detectable
with
an
ECG
in
asymptomatic
individuals.
Pre-participation screening may therefore be useful in
this scenario. With ARVC, ECG may be abnormal in
55%
to
75%
of
cases
(27–29),
and
ECG-based
pre-participation
screening
might
be
effective
at
detecting athletes with the condition. Immediate
availability
of
an
AED
could
be
potentially
life-saving for cases that are not detected during
pre-participation screening. Finally, LV fibrosis is
increasingly recognized in athletes but is not consid-
ered in isolation as a reason for exercise restriction.
This study suggests that LV fibrosis is a trigger for
exercise induced fatal arrhythmias in some athletes
and warrants longitudinal assessment of asymptom-
atic athletes with isolated LV fibrosis (30).
STUDY LIMITATIONS. The CRY Centre for Cardiac
Pathology at St George’s University of London is
more likely to receive hearts from subjects where the
clinical history is suggestive of an inherited cardiac
disease. Local pathologists are more likely to refer
challenging cases, such as athletes with ambiguous
autopsy findings or athletes for whom an obvious
cause of death cannot be established. These facts
introduce a potential referral bias; pathologies such
as coronary artery atherosclerosis and HCM may be
under-represented
in
this
cohort.
Similarly,
the
prevalence of less well-defined entities such as idio-
pathic LVH and a morphologically normal heart may
be overestimated. Nevertheless, we receive a high
volume of unexpected SCD referrals (>400 per year);
58% are in individuals <35 years of age at death,
including athletes. Considering that SCD in young
athletes
is
a
rare
event,
the
large
number
of
post-mortem examinations performed in our unit in
this cohort suggests that the results are a genuine
representation of the type and frequency of cardiac
diseases implicated in SCD in young athletes.
It is possible that subtle or incomplete expressions
of cardiomyopathy may have been misclassified as
SADS; however, considering our thorough laboratory
protocol,
it
is
highly
unlikely
that
such
cases
accounted for a significant proportion of deaths
attributed to SADS.
Our study does not include data relating to survi-
vors of sudden cardiac arrest. As such, it is possible
that the results are biased toward lethal causes of
sudden cardiac arrest such as cardiomyopathies and
primary arrhythmia syndromes, whereas diseases
more amenable to survival following cardiac arrest
are under-represented (8,9).
CONCLUSIONS
Conditions predisposing to SCD in sport demonstrate
significant age predilection. SADS accounts for most of
the deaths in the very young, whereas cardiomyopa-
thies predominate with increasing age. Although the
majority of athletes die during exertion, almost 40%
die at rest, highlighting the need for complementary
preventative strategies in addition to provision of
AED. The strong association of ARVC with exercise-
induced SCD reinforces the need for competitive
sport
restriction
in
athletes
with
the
condition.
Finally, the high prevalence of idiopathic LVH or
fibrosis underscores the need for further research in
the field in order to delineate their significance.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE:
Causes of sudden death in athletes vary with age.
SADS is prevalent in children and adolescents,
whereas cardiomyopathies are the most common
cause in adults. ARVC is strongly associated with
sudden death during exertion.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Further studies are
needed to better understanding the causes and cir-
cumstances of sudden death to facilitate development
of preventive strategies.
