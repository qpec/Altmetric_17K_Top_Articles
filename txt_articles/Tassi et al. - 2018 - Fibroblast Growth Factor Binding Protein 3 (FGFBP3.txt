Secreted FGF binding proteins (FGFBP) mobilize locally-acting paracrine FGFs from their extracellular 
storage. Here, we report that FGFBP3 (BP3) modulates fat and glucose metabolism in mouse models 
of metabolic syndrome. BP3 knockout mice exhibited altered lipid metabolism pathways with 
reduced hepatic and serum triglycerides. In obese mice the expression of exogenous BP3 reduced 
hyperglycemia, hepatosteatosis and weight gain, blunted de novo lipogenesis in liver and adipose 
tissues, increased circulating adiponectin and decreased NEFA. The BP3 protein interacts with 
endocrine FGFs through its C-terminus and thus enhances their signaling. We propose that BP3 may 
constitute a new therapeutic to reverse the pathology associated with metabolic syndrome that 
includes nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Fibroblast growth factor binding proteins (BP1, 2 and 3) are secreted chaperones known to bind and mobilize 
paracrine FGFs from their heparan sulfate (HS) storage in the extracellular matrix1–4. BP1, the best character-
ized member of this family, is known to interact with paracrine FGFs, such as FGF1, 2, 7, 10, and 222,3 and 
to compensate for the lack of HS to enhance cellular FGF receptor signaling5. BP1 can modulate FGF functions 
during development, tumorigenesis, tissue homeostasis and tissue repair. BP1 knock-down induced early chick 
embryo lethality, whereas transient overexpression of BP1 caused aberrant vascular leakage6,7. BP1 expression is 
elevated in a range of cancers and it is rate-limiting for angiogenesis-dependent cancer growth and metastasis8–12. 
In addition, BP1 is an early response gene that is upregulated in wounded skin13, in regenerating renal tubular 
epithelial cells after hemolytic uremia syndrome5, in the aorta during early atherogenesis14, in nervous fibers 
after spinal cord injury15 as well as in myofibers during reinnervation in a model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
(ALS)16. Gain-of-function studies in transgenic mice revealed that BP1 enhances neoangiogenesis in subcutane-
ous matrigel plugs, in ischemic muscle injury, as well as during skin wound healing17 and increases blood pres-
sure18. Complementary to this, in loss-of-function studies, BP1−
/− mice displayed reduced angiogenesis, delayed 
wound healing and a blunted carcinogen-induced skin papillomatosis19.
Mechanisms of action and some of the biological effects of BP2, a gene lost in rodents, and of BP3 overlap 
with BP1 in that they function as chaperones for heparin-binding, paracrine FGFs and enhance FGF signaling4,6. 
However, potential interactions of the BPs with members of the non-heparin-binding, endocrine FGF19 family 
are unknown. These endocrine FGFs, namely FGF19, FGF21 and FGF23, are released into the circulation and 
control metabolic homeostasis of glucose, lipids and phosphate20–22. Here we describe the crosstalk of endocrine 
FGFs with BP3. BP3 knockout mice exhibited an altered lipid metabolism, with reduced serum and liver triglyc-
erides. On the other hand, exogenous expression of BP3 in obese mice reduced body weight, hyperglycemia and 
normalized hepatic steatosis due to the suppression of lipogenic gene expression in the liver and white adipose tis-
sue (WAT). Finally, we show that BP3 interacts with endocrine FGFs and modulates FGF19 and FGF21 signaling 
in vitro. Our data suggest a surprising contribution of BP3 to metabolic control that could provide an innovative

and type 2 diabetes mellitus23,24.
Results
BP3−/− mice show reduced serum and liver triglycerides. 
To examine the effect of BP3 in vivo, we 
generated BP3−
/− mice from heterozygous founders obtained from the Knock-Out Mouse Project (KOMP) 
(Supplemental Fig. 1A–C). Offspring were viable, born at normal Mendelian ratios, with normal life spans and 
no gross abnormalities. An initial analysis performed by KOMP revealed that BP3−
/− mice exhibit a worsened 
GTT and lower circulating triglycerides (TG) (Supplemental Fig. 1D), suggestive of altered metabolic functions.
To evaluate the metabolic state of the animals, we subjected BP3−
/− and wild type (WT) littermates to insulin, 
glucose and pyruvate tolerance tests but found no significant differences between the WT and BP3−
/− groups 
(Fig. 1A–C). Interestingly, the average serum insulin levels were not different between BP3−
/− mice and their WT 
littermates, but we observed a significantly higher degree of variance (F-test) in the BP3−
/− group with 50% of 
the mice exhibiting high insulin levels. Circulating levels of FGF21, a potent insulin sensitizer and metabolism 
regulator, are elevated in mouse models of obesity although obese mice still respond to high doses of FGF21 
by ameliorating glucose and lipid parameters (reviewed in20). In our study FGF21 levels were low and undis-
tinguishable between WT and BP3−
/− mice and the levels of glucagon, adiponectin or beta-hydroxybutyrate 
(BHB) were unchanged between the two groups (Fig. 1D). The liver and WAT are major regulators not only of 
energy storage in the body, but also of the control of circulating fatty acids and various lipids, as well as of glucose 
homeostasis25 and we thus evaluated gene expression of enzymes that control glucose metabolism in livers and 
white adipose tissues (WAT) of BP3−
/− and WT mice. Loss of BP3 resulted in a significant mRNA upregulation 
of hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (Pck1), a key regulator of gluconeogenesis, and of interleukin 6 
(Il6) that has been linked to insulin resistance26,27 (Fig. 1E). Hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ
 
coactivator-1α
 (Ppargc1a), suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (Socs3), glucose-6-phospatase (G6pc), Leptin 
receptor 1 (Lpr1), Fgf21 and β
-Klotho (KLB) expression were undistinguishable between WT and BP3−
/− mice 
(Fig. 1E,F).
We next measured circulating lipids in BP3−
/− and WT mice. Circulating phospholipids, non-esterified 
fatty acids (NEFA), and cholesterol remained unchanged when comparing the genotypes (Fig. 1G). However, 
BP3−
/− mice displayed significantly lower baseline TG levels in agreement with findings of KOMP (Fig. 1G & 
Supplemental Fig. 1D). To gain further insights into BP3-induced metabolic alterations, we performed com-
prehensive, unbiased serum and liver metabolomics analyses in WT and BP3−
/− mice. In line with decreased 
serum triglycerides, we found a striking ~14-fold reduction of 9,10,13-trihydroxystearic acid serum lev-
els in BP3−
/− mice (Fig. 1H). We also detected increased circulating levels of arachidonic acid and 5-HETE, 
ω
-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω
-3-PUFAs) precursor and metabolite respectively (Fig. 1H), that have been 
previously connected with worsened insulin resistance28.
Livers from BP3−
/− mice were similar in size and macroscopic and microscopic appearance relative to those of 
WT littermates. In line with the levels of lower circulating TG, the amount of hepatic TG were also two-fold lower 
in BP3−
/− mice relative to WT controls, whereas the total hepatic lipid content was indistinguishable between the 
different genotypes (Fig. 1I). A liver metabolomics analysis showed a >2-fold increase of hepatic alpha-linolenic 
acid, an ω
-3-PUFA precursor (Fig. 1J) and, most prominently, a 4.5- to 40-fold reduction of different TG isomers 
in BP3−
/− mice (Fig. 1K). Thus, the loss of BP3 impacts hepatic accumulation of TGs, but not total lipids.
To evaluate the underlying pathways, we measured changes in baseline expression of key fatty acid and TG 
synthesis enzymes and their upstream regulators in both livers and WAT of BP3−
/− and WT mice (Fig. 1L,M). 
Interestingly, Ppargc1b, a key upstream regulator of lipogenesis and steatosis29, was significantly reduced in 
BP3−
/− mice. As a consequence, essential de novo lipogenesis enzyme genes such as acetoacetyl-coenzyme A 
synthetase (Aacs), acetyl-CoA carboxylase Alpha (Acac), ATP citrate lyase (Acly), acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase 2 
(Acas2), and fatty acid synthase (Fasn) were significantly downregulated in BP3−
/− animals. Moreover, the lack of 
BP3 reduced expression of Stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (Scd1) and Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 and 2 (Dgat1 
and Dgat2), that are rate limiting enzymes for TG synthesis30 (Fig. 1L). Silencing of the lipogenic enzymatic 
machinery in mice lacking BP3 provides an explanation for the reduced serum stearic acid and TG levels. The 
effect appears to be liver specific and was not seen in the comparison of WAT gene expression (Fig. 1M). These 
data altogether suggest that endogenous BP3 controls glucose and lipid metabolic pathways.
Chronic expression of BP3 in ob/ob mice reduces hyperglycemia, weight gain, steatosis, WAT and BAT mass and liver 
lipids. We next sought to identify BP3 mechanisms of action in the modulation of lipid and glucose metabolism. 
For this, we chronically administered a BP3 expression vector to leptin deficient ob/ob mice, an animal model 
with metabolic disease and dysregulated lipogenic and gluconeogenic genes31–33. We delivered a plasmid that 
expressed full length murine BP3 (=mBP3) repeatedly over a period of 18 days using a cationic polymer carrier 
(Fig. 2A) and detected exogenous mBP3 mRNA in livers and lungs by qPCR (Fig. 2B) as well as protein in lungs 
by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2C). We transduced the plasmid repeatedly as mice showed a progressive loss of 
exogenous mBP3 in the liver as early as 6 days after treatment (Supplemental Fig. 2). The mBP3 expressing ob/
ob mice exhibited significantly lower body weight and weight gain relative to control littermates (Fig. 2D), paral-
leled by a reduction of visceral white adipose tissues (WAT) (Fig. 2E,F) and interscapular brown adipose tissues 
(iBAT) (Fig. 2G,H). A crude measurement of food intake performed in two independent experiments indicated 
a slight increase of food consumption in mBP3 treated cohort [3.03 ± 0.38 vs. 3.09 ± 0.17 g/day (n = 3–6), and 
3.86 ± 0.49 vs. 4.60 ± 0.50 g/day; ctrl vs. mBP3, (n = 5)] that was not statistically significant, indicating that BP3 
does not suppress appetite. Administration of mBP3 significantly reduced hyperglycemia (−
124.5 ± 58.2 mg/dl 
glucose at day 18 vs day 0) (Fig. 2I) whereas blood glucose levels in control ob/ob animals remained unaltered 
(−
21 ± 68 mg/dl glucose at day 18 vs day 0) (Fig. 2I). Moreover, during the course of the study, mean daily blood

glucose was significantly lowered in the mBP3 group (−
84.58 ± 47.03 vs 9.67 ± 39.87 mg/dl glucose; mBP3 vs 
control) (Fig. 2J). The amelioration of hyperglycemic conditions in mBP3 overexpressing ob/ob mice was par-
allel by a significant reduction of BHB (Fig. 2K). Furthermore, when compared to control ob/ob littermates,

exogenous mBP3 expressing mice exhibited a significant decrease of serum non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) 
and increase of FGF21 and adiponectin, whereas TG, cholesterol, phospholipids and glucagon levels remained 
unchanged (Fig. 2K). It has been shown that increased circulating NEFA levels in ob/ob mice contribute to the 
onset of hepatic macro- and microsteatosis34,35, whereas adiponectin, an FGF21-induced adipokine, is negatively 
correlated to the hepatic fat content36. Strikingly, commensurate with the reduced NEFA and increased FGF21 
and adiponectin levels in the serum, livers of mBP3 expressing ob/ob mice displayed a significant reduction of 
steatosis and were almost indistinguishable microscopically from healthy livers (Fig. 2L,M). Chronic mBP3 treat-
ment induced a slight reduction of liver gross weight (2.43 ± 0.12 vs 2.06 ± 0.09, ctrl vs mBP3) and failed to cause 
hepatocyte proliferation as measured by ex vivo BrdU incorporation (Supplemental Fig. 3). As a consequence of 
liver remodeling, we observed an increased number of proliferating liver sinusoidal cells. Commensurate with 
the amelioration of steatosis, mBP3 expressing ob/ob mice exhibited a significant decrease of total liver lipids 
(Fig. 2N) and triglycerides (Fig. 2O) when compared to ob/ob control animals. Hepatic metabolomics profiling 
of mBP3 transduced mice showed a 55-fold reduction of glycerol and between 2.5 to 9-fold decrease of the oleic, 
palmitic, capric, lauroleic and tridecanoid NEFAs (Fig. 2P), that resulted in a significant decrease of hepatic 
diglycerides (DG) (Fig. 2Q) and TG (Fig. 2R), particularly those containing palmitic (16:0), stearic (18:0) and 
arachidic (20:0) acids. Interestingly, the amount of hepatic TG in mBP3 treated animals was blunted to levels 
undistinguishable from those of WT lean mice (Fig. 2S).
In summary, these data indicate that sustained BP3 treatment in ob/ob mice reduces body weight, hyperglyce-
mia, fat mass and steatosis likely due to an increase of serum adiponectin and reduction of circulating NEFA and 
intrahepatic lipids and without inducing a hepatocellular mitogenic response.
Chronic expression of BP3 in ob/ob mice suppresses gluconeogenic and lipogenic gene expression. We next exam-
ined hepatic and WAT gene expression changes in ob/ob mice after chronic treatment with the BP3 expression 
vector (Fig. 3A). Consistent with a reduction of blood glucose (Fig. 2I,J), mBP3 overexpression resulted in a 
two-fold suppression of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6pc), the hepatic rate-limiting enzyme for gluconeogenesis. 
This is likely mediated by the increase of interleukin 6 (Il6) and a decrease of peroxisome proliferator-activated 
receptor-γ
 coactivator-1α
 (Ppargc1a) expression (Fig. 3B). Il6 and Ppargc1a were similarly regulated in WAT 
(Fig. 3C). Notably, no changes of hepatic Lpr1, Socs3, Fgf21 or KLB mRNA expression were observed after chronic 
BP3 administration (Fig. 3B,C). Next, we evaluated the regulation of the de novo lipogenesis genes in both liver 
and WAT of mBP3 transduced ob/ob mice. Expression of the lipogenesis regulator Fgf21 was downregulated in 
WAT whereas Ppargc1b and Srebf129,37 were significantly reduced in both tissues, likely resulting in the observed 
downstream suppression of Aacs, Acac, Acas2, Acly, and Fasn. Additionally, Scd1 and Dgat2 were significantly 
reduced in both livers and WAT (Fig. 3B,C). Finally, uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) mRNA levels in the BAT were 
indistinguishable between the BP3 treated and the control group indicating no obvious effect on thermogenesis 
regulation (Supplemental Fig. 4).
To investigate the effect of a chronic mBP3 administration on signaling pathways that govern carbohydrate 
and fatty acid metabolism, we analyzed the phosphorylation state of Akt and Stat3, key effector molecules of 
gluconeogenic and lipogenic genes in ob/ob mice38,39. Sustained mBP3 expression increased hepatic endogenous 
Stat3 and Akt phosphorylation by 2.8 and 3.9 fold, respectively, while total Stat3 and Akt proteins remained 
unchanged (Fig. 3D).
A single administration of the mBP3 expression vector to ad libitum fed ob/ob mice (Fig. 3E) transiently 
reduced the pathologically elevated blood glucose levels of >300 mg/dl significantly to normoglycemia (Fig. 3F), 
whereas control mice remained hyperglycemic. This effect was corroborated by a transient four-fold downregula-
tion of hepatic G6pc mRNA expression (Fig. 3G) and was paralleled by a significant mBP3 overexpression in both 
liver and WAT up to 72 hours post transduction (Fig. 3G,H). Moreover, a sustained suppression of Fasn and Scd1 
mRNAs in livers and WAT was observed whereas upregulation of Il6 was seen exclusively in the WAT for 24, 48 
and 72 hours post transduction (Fig. 3G,H).
Overall, our data suggest that chronic BP3 treatment in ob/ob mice results in the suppression of rate-limiting 
genes regulating metabolic pathways in the liver and WAT that control the synthesis of lipids and glucose.
Chronic expression of BP3 in diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice suppresses hyperglycemia, weight gain and hepatic and 
WAT lipogenic gene expression. Next, we sought to investigate the response to exogenous mBP3 in C57BL/6J 
DIO (=diet-induced obesity) mice, an animal model that mimics the most common cause of human obesity40. 
mBP3 plasmid or an empty vector control were administered eight times over a period of 42 days to 14 week-old 
DIO mice (Fig. 4A). Consistent with our findings in the ob/ob mouse model (Fig. 2), BP3 exhibited a signifi-
cant anti-obesity and antidiabetogenic effect. mBP3 treated DIO mice, in contrast to their control littermates, 
failed to gain body weight, despite a high calorie intake (Fig. 4B,C). Circulating insulin, FGF21, adiponectin, and 
NEFA remained unchanged between the two groups (Fig. 4D). Still, mBP3 treated DIO mice exhibited signifi-
cantly lower blood glucose (Fig. 4E,F) that coincided with a significant 3.5 fold reduction of hepatic G6pc mRNA 
(Fig. 4G). Moreover, BP3 treatment induced a significant downregulation of hepatic Srebf1 mRNA and its target 
genes, such as Acly, Acas2, Fasn and Scd1. However, Lepr, Il6, Ppargc1b, Acac, Dgat2, Fgf21 and KLB transcript 
level remained unchanged from the control (Fig. 4G). Similarly, WAT Fgf21, KLB and Srebf1 mRNA levels were 
reduced as well as Acac, Acas2, Fasn, Scd1, Dgat1 and Dgat2, but not Ppargc1b, Aacs, or Acly (Fig. 4H).
Taken together these data suggest that BP3 impacts the de novo lipogenesis and TG synthesis enzymatic cas-
cade also in the DIO mouse model.
BP3 binds to endocrine FGFs and enhances their signaling in vitro. 
The interactions of FGF-binding 
proteins (BPs) with heparin-binding, paracrine FGFs have been well-defined. BP1 was found to supplement for a

lack of HS in FGF2 signaling1,2,4,5. From this we expected a different interaction of BPs and endocrine FGFs that 
exhibit a low heparin affinity [reviewed in41]. The predicted structures of the BP1 and BP3 C-terminal FGF bind-
ing domains2,4,5,42 show distinct features (Fig. 5A) and we thus compared the interaction of both proteins with 
FGF19, the prototypic member of the endocrine FGF family. We generated an MBP-tagged human recombinant

verified its purity and identity by Coomassie blue staining and western blot analysis with anti-hBP3 and MBP 
antibodies (Supplemental Fig. 5B,C) as well as mass spectrometry (Supplemental Fig. 5D). Surprisingly, FGF19 
showed a significantly stronger binding to BP3 than to BP1 (Fig. 5B). Binding of BP3 to FGF19 was also confirmed 
by surface plasmon resonance (SPR; Biacore) (Fig. 5C). BP3 bound with analogous affinity to FGF15, the FGF19 
murine ortholog, and to FGF23 (Fig. 5D). Moreover, as shown in a solid-phase equilibrium binding assay, BP3 
could bind to FGF2 and FGF19 in a similar fashion, with a Kd = 0.269 ± 0.273 nM and Kd = 0.172 ± 0.341 nM, 
respectively (Fig. 5E,F).

In support of the notion that FGF19 and FGF21 utilize KLB as co-receptor41, we sought to investigate the 
effect of BP3 on the FGF/KLB interaction. Excess concentrations of KLB, but not α
-Klotho (KLa), inhibited the 
interaction of BP3 with either FGF19 or FGF21 (Fig. 5G) indicating mutually exclusive binding of either BP3 or 
KLB to these endocrine FGFs.
Because endocrine FGFs do not utilize HS, we tested the effects of a C-terminal fragment of the BP3 protein 
(C66) that lacks the BP3 heparin-binding domain (HBD) (Fig. 5H). MBP-tagged C66 was purified by affinity 
chromatography and its purity established by Coomassie blue staining (Fig. 5I). By SPR, the C66 fragment dis-
played a higher binding affinity for FGF19 than for FGF2, which distinguished it from the full-length protein 
(Fig. 5J). In addition, in a solid-phase equilibrium binding assay, C66 showed binding to increasing concentra-
tions of FGF19, FGF15 and FGF21 (Fig. 5K–M). These data suggest that the C-terminal FGF-binding domain of 
BP3 is sufficient for the interaction with endocrine FGFs.
Since the preferential receptor of FGF19 is FGFR443, we examined the interaction of BP3 and FGF19 with 
immobilized recombinant FGFR4 in a cell-free assay. The inclusion of BP3 enhanced FGF19 - FGFR4 binding by 
2.8-fold (Fig. 5N) and we conclude that BP3 favors the formation of a stable complex between FGF19 and FGFR4.
FGF19 and FGF21 have been shown to activate ERK1/2 in HepG2 cells44,45. We found that addition of 
BP3 to FGF19 increased the activation of ERK1/2 by 1.3 to 2.8 fold, while BP3 alone did not show an effect 
(Fig. 5O). Similarly, FGF21-induced ERK1/2 activation was enhanced by added BP3 by ~1.8 fold (Fig. 5P). 
Klotho deficient-HEK293 cells will signal in response to endocrine FGFs only after KLa or KLB overexpression, 
whereas FGF2 can induce a robust downstream ERK1/2 activation46,47 (and Fig. 5Q). Interestingly, exogenous 
co-administration of recombinant BP3 and FGF19 proteins to HEK293 cells was sufficient to elicit ERK1/2 phos-
phorylation, while either protein alone had no detectable effect (Fig. 5Q). This shows that BP3 is sufficient to 
promote receptor activation by an endocrine FGF in the absence of KLB. We conclude that BP3 binds to the 
endocrine FGFs, competes with KLB, and can enhance FGF19 and FGF21 signaling in vitro.
In composite, our data suggest that BP3 is a metabolic modulator that interacts with endocrine FGFs and can 
ameliorate metabolic syndrome pathology by modulation of glucose and lipid metabolism in liver and adipose 
tissues. The schematic in Fig. 6 connects the signaling pathways to the respective metabolic enzyme cascade and 
biological function impacted by chronic BP3 treatment in obesity models.
Discussion
In this report we show a new role for BP3 in regulating carbohydrate and lipid metabolism that overlaps with the 
effects of endocrine FGF19 and FGF2148. BP1 and BP3 proteins share 8 conserved cysteine residues responsible 
for the formation of disulfide bonds4 but possess a distinct C-terminal FGF binding domain, as evidenced by 
the secondary structure prediction (see Fig. 5A). We had hypothesized that these structural differences could 
translate into differential affinity and selectivity of BP1 and BP3 for different FGFs. BP1 and BP3 have been 
shown to bind to paracrine FGF1 and 2 and modulate their signaling and biological functions2,4. ECM-bound 
paracrine FGFs are released by BPs that compete with the binding of FGF to the heparin-rich ECM2. In con-
trast to the paracrine FGFs, endocrine FGFs are characterized by a weak heparin binding, as they lack the crit-
ical GXXXXGXX(T/S) binding motif. This explains their ability to freely circulate and thus act in a systemic, 
hormone-like, rather than local fashion41. A surprising result from our present study is that BP3 binds with high 
affinity to FGF19, the prototype member of the endocrine FGF family, and to FGF21 and FGF23, the other two 
members of the family, whilst BP1 exhibits a lower affinity. Notably, the C-terminal FGF-binding domain (C66) 
exhibits a higher affinity for FGF19 than FGF2. Furthermore, the interaction between FGF19 and BP3 stabilizes 
the ligand/receptor complex and enhances downstream signaling. Based on the competitive binding of BP3 and 
KLB proteins to FGF19 and FGF21 and the ability of BP3 to evoke FGF19 signaling in vitro despite the lack of 
KLB, we propose that BP3 may function as a co-receptor for these endocrine FGFs.
The ablation of endogenous BP3 did not impact embryo viability or overall survival but was associated with 
abnormal GTT and reduced levels of circulating triglycerides, suggesting an increased risk for metabolic disease 
(Supplemental Fig. 1D). Both FGF19 and FGF21 are insulin-independent modulators of carbohydrate and lipid 
metabolism in rodents, primates and humans48. Knockout mouse models for FGF15, the mouse ortholog of 
FGF19, and for FGF21 develop glucose intolerance and insulin resistance49,50. Similarly, BP3−
/− mice showed 
trends of hyperinsulinemia and upregulation of key hepatic gluconeogenic genes that can result in an increase of 
fasting blood glucose and abnormal insulin resistance.

BP3 did not seem to be differentially regulated between lean C57BL/6 J and ob/ob or DIO mouse ilea, livers 
and WAT (Supplemental Fig. 6). However, a survey of published gene expression data in tissues from diabetic 
human subjects or from diabetes-related mouse models showed a significant downregulation of BP3. BP1 expres-
sion was typically not correlated with the disease (Supplemental Fig. 7A–F). This supports a contribution of 
endogenous BP3 to the mechanisms underlying metabolic disease revealed by the phenotypic characteristics of 
the BP3−
/− mice (see Fig. 1).
Exogenous BP3 induced a robust activation of hepatic STAT3 and inhibition of Ppargc1b and Srebf1, the 
transcriptional regulators of lipogenic genes, resulting in reduced de novo lipogenesis, FA elongation and TG 
synthesis (see scheme in Fig. 6). Chronic expression of BP3 indeed resulted in a dramatic reduction of white and 
brown fat mass and an amelioration of hepatic steatosis. Mechanisms that induce fatty liver disease are mostly 
due to increased NEFA delivery from peripheral WAT and a greater de novo lipogenesis alongside with insulin 
resistance, whereas β
-oxidation of FA seems to be of marginal importance34,37. That is, chronically treated ob/ob 
mice exhibit reduced circulating and liver fatty acids and increased circulating FGF21 and adiponectin as well as 
a significant suppression of the de novo hepatic lipogenic enzymatic cascade, providing an explanation for the 
reversal of steatosis. It is noteworthy that circulating NEFA levels are reduced in mice after recombinant FGF19 
and FGF21 treatment and are elevated in FGF21−
/− mice43,51. Consistent with our findings, the amelioration of 
a fatty liver phenotype in FGF21-treated DIO mice results from the suppression of the Srebf1-induced fatty acid 
biosynthetic pathway52. Moreover, the beneficial effects of FGF21 on obesity-associated metabolic disorders are 
dependent on the increase of adiponectin mRNA and protein and are obliterated in adiponectin-deficient mice53. 
Notably, the effect of BP3 treatment on weight gain mimics the effect of FGF21 in ob/ob and in the DIO mouse 
models54.
The improved glycemic control in obese mice after acute or chronic BP3 treatment was also paralleled by a 
downregulation of G6pc, the rate limiting gluconeogenic enzyme, likely resulting from sustained hepatic Akt and 
Stat3 activation and Il6 upregulation. We found that BP3 activates the IL6/STAT3 signaling axis, which represents 
a previously unknown FGF-response pathway. To date, the role of IL6 in obesity-associated insulin resistance is 
controversial55: Impaired insulin action can be induced by increased IL6 levels in vivo or vice versa, thus denoting 
an unfavorable metabolic effect of IL656,57. Conversely, in gain-of-function studies, others have suggested that 
IL6 can have an anti-inflammatory beneficial role in preventing obesity and T2D in a STAT3-dependent man-
ner58. Moreover, IL6 can have an insulin sensitizing effect by increasing glucose uptake in cultured and intact 
Figure 6. Summary of the pathways impacted by chronic BP3 treatment in liver and WAT in obese mouse 
models. BP3 enhances FGF/FGFR signaling and downstream activation of Akt and IL6/Stat3 that lead to the 
inhibition of gluconeogenesis, through Ppargc1a/G6pc downregulation. The parallel activation of Akt and Stat3 
results in an inhibition of Ppargc1b and/or Srebf1, key regulators of downstream lipogenic enzymes, thus leading 
to the inhibition of de novo lipogenesis and TG synthesis.

human skeletal muscle59 and by modulating insulin release after glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion from intestinal 
L and pancreatic alpha cells in response to exercise60. In our studies, IL6 upregulation, seen after BP3 treatment, 
matches with improved insulin sensitivity, obesity and steatosis in IL6 transgenic mice58,61,62, likely by suppress-
ing gluconeogenic and lipogenic enzymatic cascade via hepatic STAT3 phosphorylation (see scheme in Fig. 6). 
Complementary to this, hepatocyte-specific IL6R, IL6, or STAT3 deficient mice develop increased gluconeogene-
sis and insulin resistance, as a result of G6pc upregulation, likely via a PI3K/FoxO1-independent pathway, as well 
as age-related obesity and steatosis38,63.
Obesity, which affects more than 650 million people worldwide, is the major driver for metabolic syn-
drome, which also encompasses disorders such as insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, hypertension and dys-
lipidemia23. Our studies show that the interaction between BP3 and endocrine FGFs could be leveraged for a 
novel approach to the treatment of metabolic disease and the associated symptoms. Both FGF19 and FGF21 
are potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of metabolic syndrome48,64. However, the mitogenic effects of 
FGF19 and the induction of hepatocellular carcinoma in FGF19 transgenic mice and in mice treated with the 
recombinant protein are of concern65. In contrast, FGF21 lacks a proliferative activity both in vitro and in vivo66. 
Moreover, in line with these observations, a recent report has proposed that the endocrinization of FGF1 exhibits 
anti-diabetogenic and non-mitogenic effects in mice67. It is noteworthy that when chronically delivered to ob/ob 
mice, BP3 fails to induce a hepatocellular mitogenic response, thus matching with the lack of mitogenic effects 
reported for FGF1 and FGF21.
In conclusion, the striking reduction of fat mass and fatty liver disease as well as hyperglycemia and the lack of 
a mitogenic response make BP3 an attractive candidate for the treatment of metabolic disease.
Methods
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). 
High binding ELISA plates (Nest Scientific, Rahway, 
NJ) were coated with 100 μ
l/well of recombinant proteins (human recombinant FGF2, FGF15, FGF19, or FGF23, 
7.5 μ
g/ml] and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed thrice between each incubation step with washing 
buffer [1X Phosphate buffered saline with 0.2% Tween 20, pH 7.4 (PBST)]. Blocking was carried out with 100 μ
l/
well of 5% dry milk diluted in PBST for 1 hour at room temperature. Subsequently, plates were incubated for 
2 hours at room temperature with 100 μ
l/well of an MBP-tagged recombinant protein (MBP control, BP3 or C66) 
at a fixed concentration (0.7 nM) or in serial dilutions. Detection was carried out with 100 μ
l/well of an anti-MBP 
mouse monoclonal antibody (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA) and with an affinity-purified goat anti-mouse 
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, PA) (1:1,000 dilu-
tion in PBS). The reactions were visualized with the aid of 1-Step Turbo TMB (Thermo Scientific, Grand Island, 
NY), according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and read with an Ultramark Microplate Imaging System (Bio-Rad 
Laboratories, Hercules, CA) at 450 nm absorbance. For the competitive protein binding assays, increasing excess 
amounts of β
-Klotho (KLB) or α
-Klotho (KLa) (competitors) were bound to immobilized FGF19 or FGF21 
(2.5 μ
g/ml) for 1 hour prior to the addition of BP3 or MBP control (0.15 μ
g/ml) in MaxiSorp microtiter plates 
(Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Human recombinant FGF2 was purchased from Life Technologies (Grand Island, 
NY). Recombinant human FGF21, human FGF23, human KLa and mouse KLB were purchased from R&D 
Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Recombinant FGF15 was purchased from MyBioSource (San Diego, CA). Human 
recombinant FGF19 was generated in the lab of Dr. Moosa Mohammadi at NYU.
Surface Plasmon Resonance Binding Assay. Biacore T200 instrument (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) was used 
for surface plasmon resonance measurements. Human recombinant FGF19 or FGF2 in HBS-P buffer (0.01 M 
HEPES pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05% P-20) were immobilized on a flow cell of a CM-5 sensor chip (GE Healthcare) 
via amine coupling. A blank flow cell was used as a negative control for non-specific binding to the sensor surface. 
BP3 (1, 0.5, or 0.25 μ
M) or C66 (245 nM) in HBS-P buffer were injected over the immobilized proteins with a flow 
rate of 10 µL/min for 60 seconds and the resulting maximum responses were obtained. The experiments were 
performed in triplicate.
Binding of BP3 to FGFR4/FGF19 complex. MaxiSorp microtiter plates were coated with 0.75 mg of human 
recombinant FGFR4 Fc Chimera (R&D Systems) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed thrice 
between each incubation step with PBS. Blocking was carried out with 100 μ
l/well of 5% dry milk diluted in PBS 
for 1 hour at room temperature. Subsequently, plates were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature with 100 μ
l/
well of FGF19 (2 μ
g/ml) ± BP3 or MBP control (1 μ
g/ml). Bound proteins were detected by western blot analysis 
with 1 μ
g/ml of an anti FGFR4 (LD1; a kind gift of Genentech, South San Francisco, CA), anti MBP (New England 
BioLabs) or anti FGF19 (Abnova, Walnut, CA) mouse monoclonal antibodies.
Cell cultures. 
Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) and HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s 
modified Eagle’s medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum.
Animals, genotyping and animal treatments. 
Animal experiments were reviewed and approved by 
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Georgetown University. All experiments were performed in 
accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. BP3−
/− mice were generated by the trans-NIH Knock-Out 
Mouse Project (KOMP) and obtained from the KOMP Repository (University of California, Davis, CA) (www.
komp.org). BP3−
/− mice were genotyped by q-PCR (see below) under the following conditions: 95 °C for 3 min-
utes, followed by 40 cycles (95 °C for 20 seconds, 65 °C for 30 seconds, and 72 °C for 40 seconds). The PCR primers 
are in Table S1.

Twelve week-old C57BL/6J DIO male mice and six week-old ob/ob female mice were purchased from The 
Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). C57BL/6 J DIO mice were maintained on a HFD containing 60% kCal 
from fat (D12492; Research Diets, Inc., New Brunswick, NJ) from weaning for at least 14 weeks before random-
ization by weight and treatment and until the completion of the study. Body weight ranged from 30 to 47 grams. 
Animals were maintained in a normal light-cycle room and were provided with regular diet or HFD and water ad 
libitum. Body weight gain was calculated as the daily body weight minus body weight before treatment for each 
animal and presented as an average for the group.
pCMV6-Kan/Neo mouse FGFBP3 (mBP3) or the empty vector (Origene, Rockville, MD) were delivered in 
vivo by an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection with the TurboFect in vivo Transfection Reagent (ThermoScientific), 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. This reagent, developed by Dharmacon, was designed to avoid 
an inflammatory response in mice as determined by TNFalpha induction by ELISA and also for intraperito-
neal injections (http://dharmacon.gelifesciences.com/transfection/turbofect-in-vivo-transfection-reagent/). The 
endotoxin measure in our plasmid prep was 0.2 EU/ug and thus considered endotoxin free.
Glucose, insulin and pyruvate tolerance test. 
Glucose, insulin and pyruvate tolerance tests (GTT, 
ITT and PTT) were performed by an i.p. injection of glucose (1 g kg−
1), insulin (0.75 IU kg−
1) (Novo Nordisk 
Novolin-R, ADW Diabetes, Pompano Beach, FL) or pyruvate (1 g kg−
1) (Sigma Aldrich) in mice fasted overnight 
(for GTT and PTT) or for 6 hours (for ITT). Tail blood glucose concentrations were measured with a portable 
glucose meter (Contour, Bayer, Whippany, NJ) as indicated in the respective figures. Average Δ
 glucose was cal-
culated as the group average of daily or weekly blood glucose concentration minus blood glucose concentration 
before treatment for each animal.
Histological Analysis. 
Histologic hepatosteatosis score was performed semiquantitatively on five to 10 
H&E-stained paraffin-embedded liver sections by two blinded investigators and expressed as percentage of fatty 
hepatocytes occupying the hepatic parenchyma.
Western Blots and Immunoprecipitation. 
Immunoprecipitation and western blot analyses were 
performed as described earlier17. Briefly, livers or lungs from ob/ob mice were homogenized in 1 mL of lysis 
buffer with a MagNa lyser homogenizer (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). 5 mg of total liver lysates were immunopre-
cipitated with 10 μ
l of sepharose-conjugated anti-Akt or phospho Stat3 antibodies and immunoblotted with an 
anti-phospho Akt or anti-Stat3 rabbit polyclonal antibodies, respectively. Total Akt and Stat3 in the liver lysates 
(50 μ
g) were detected using an anti-Akt and Stat3 rabbit polyclonal antibodies, respectively. ERK1/2 phospho-
rylation studies in HepG2 cells were performed by immunoblotting for phospho ERK1/2 and anti-ERK1/2 with 
rabbit polyclonal antibodies, as described2. All antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). 
mBP3 expression in transfected ob/ob mouse lungs was detected by immunoblot analysis using an anti mouse 
FGFBP3 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Abgent).
RNA isolation, microarray analysis and quantitative real-time PCR. 
Total RNA was isolated 
from mouse livers, lungs, WAT or ilea using RNeasy Mini kit or RNeasy Lipid Tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, 
CA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was synthesized from 1 μ
g of total RNA using the 
iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit, according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). 
Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed in a Realplex2 (Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY) using the 
iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories) under the following conditions: 95 °C for 3 minutes, followed 
by 40 cycles (95 °C for 20 seconds, 60 °C for 30 seconds, and 72 °C for 40 seconds). mRNA levels, determined by 
qRT-PCR, were normalized to endogenous β
-actin mRNA and shown as fold of control. The forward (FW) and 
reverse (Rev) PCR primers for murine genes used are provided in Table S1.
Data Analysis and Statistics. 
GraphPad Prism (La Jolla, CA) was used to compare the means of two or 
more groups by Student’s t-test or ANOVA respectively. Semiquantitative scoring of hepatosteatosis was analyzed 
by χ
2 test for trend. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05.
