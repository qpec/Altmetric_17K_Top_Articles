ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND Contemporary reconsideration of diagnostic N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)
cutoffs for diagnosis of heart failure (HF) is needed.
OBJECTIVES This study sought to evaluate the diagnostic performance of NT-proBNP for acute HF in patients with
dyspnea in the emergency department (ED) setting.
METHODS Dyspneic patients presenting to 19 EDs in North America were enrolled and had blood drawn for subsequent
NT-proBNP measurement. Primary endpoints were positive predictive values of age-stratified cutoffs (450, 900, and
1,800 pg/ml) for diagnosis of acute HF and negative predictive value of the rule-out cutoff to exclude acute HF. Sec-
ondary endpoints included sensitivity, specificity, and positive (þ) and negative (�) likelihood ratios (LRs) for acute HF.
RESULTS Of 1,461 subjects, 277 (19%) were adjudicated as having acute HF. The area under the receiver-operating
characteristic curve for diagnosis of acute HF was 0.91 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.90 to 0.93; p < 0.001).
Sensitivity for age stratified cutoffs of 450, 900, and 1,800 pg/ml was 85.7%, 79.3%, and 75.9%, respectively;
specificity was 93.9%, 84.0%, and 75.0%, respectively. Positive predictive values were 53.6%, 58.4%, and 62.0%,
respectively. Overall LRþ across age-dependent cutoffs was 5.99 (95% CI: 5.05 to 6.93); individual LRþ for
age-dependent cutoffs was 14.08, 4.95, and 3.03, respectively. The sensitivity and negative predictive value for the
rule-out cutoff of 300 pg/ml were 93.9% and 98.0%, respectively; LR� was 0.09 (95% CI: 0.05 to 0.13).
CONCLUSIONS In acutely dyspneic patients seen in the ED setting, age-stratified NT-proBNP cutpoints may aid in the
diagnosis of acute HF. An NT-proBNP <300 pg/ml strongly excludes the presence of acute HF. (J Am Coll Cardiol

atriuretic peptide testing (B-type
natriuretic peptide [BNP] and its
amino-terminal pro-peptide cleav-
age equivalent, N-terminal pro–B-type natri-
uretic
peptide
[NT-proBNP])
aids
in
the
diagnosis of acute heart failure (HF) (1–4).
These
biomarkers
are
now
embedded as
Class I, Level of Evidence: A in clinical prac-
tice
guidelines
(5).
Understanding
the
optimal means to interpret natriuretic pep-
tide tests has evolved, and recent changes
in certain characteristics of patients affected
by HF suggest the need to reassess the cur-
rent natriuretic peptide diagnostic cutoffs.
Such changes include shifting HF demo-
graphics
(6,7),
including
more
prevalent
renal disease and atrial fibrillation, which
possibly
contributes
to
higher
biomarker
concentrations (8). Conversely, increasing
incidence and prevalence of HF with preserved ejec-
tion fraction and patient obesity, both of which may
result in lower natriuretic peptide concentrations,
may require lower BNP or NT-proBNP cutoffs. Simi-
larly, the growing use of HF medications influencing
BNP or NT-proBNP values (such as neprilysin inhibi-
tion) may also change optimal cutoffs for diagnosis
of acute exacerbation of HF.
Data from the PRIDE (N-Terminal Pro-BNP Inves-
tigation of Dyspnea in the Emergency Department)
and ICON (International Collaborative of NT-proBNP)
studies suggested optimal diagnostic cutoffs of 450,
900, and 1,800 pg/ml for age categories of <50, 50 to
75, and >75 years, respectively, for the identification
of acute HF (9), along with an age-independent cutoff
of 300 pg/ml to exclude acute HF. These cutoffs have
been widely endorsed (1,5,10); however, they differ
substantially from the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA)–approved cutoffs for NT-proBNP (125 and 450
pg/ml for <75 and $75 years of age) (11), which are
optimized for outpatient exclusion of ambulatory HF.
Thus, there is a need to reconsider which cutoffs
should be used, as continued reliance on current,
approved cutoffs has the potential for diagnostic in-
accuracy, particularly for test specificity.
In light of these current gaps, the aim of the ICON-
RELOADED (ICON: Re-evaluation of Acute Diagnostic
Cut-Offs in the Emergency Department) study is to
validate the age-specific NT-proBNP cutoffs identified
in the first ICON study in a contemporary cohort. We
hypothesized that the original ICON strategy for
NT-proBNP
interpretation
would
remain
useful
for
diagnostic
evaluation
of
HF in an all-comer
population of patients with dyspnea.

A blood sample was taken at enrollment.
A clinical events adjudication committee, blinded
to NT-proBNP results (obtained either by the hospital
or by the study), independently reviewed and adju-

STUDY OBJECTIVES. The primary objective of this
study was to externally validate the use of Elecsys
proBNP II (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Indiana)
concentrations to aid in the diagnosis or exclusion of
acute HF in patients presenting emergently through
use of the ICON cutpoint strategy (9).
STUDY ENDPOINTS. The primary efficacy endpoints
for this study were the positive predictive value (PPV)
of age-specific rule-in cutoffs of 450, 900, and 1,800
pg/ml for ages <50, 50 to 75, and >75 years, respec-
tively, for the diagnosis of acute HF, and the negative
predictive value (NPV) of the rule-out cutoff of 300
pg/ml to exclude the adjudicated diagnosis of acute
HF. Secondary endpoints included the NPV, positive
likelihood ratio (LRþ), sensitivity, and specificity for
the age-specific rule-in cutoffs, as well as the negative
likelihood ratio (LR�), sensitivity, and specificity for
the
rule-out
cutoff.
Other
secondary
endpoints
included the PPV of all age-based rule-in cutoffs
combined for the adjudicated diagnosis of acute HF
by region (United States and Canada), and the NPV of
the rule-out cutoff by region.
NT-proBNP MEASUREMENTS. A cobase 601 analyzer
(Roche Diagnostics) was used for all NT-proBNP
measurements.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES. The study was designed to
include 1,765 patients to ensure a sample size of at
least
1,500
analyzable
patients,
assuming
15%
attrition.
Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves for
performance of NT-proBNP for diagnosis of acute HF
were constructed. Operating characteristics for each
cutoff for rule-in and the proposed cutoff for rule-out
relative to the gold-standard diagnosis were evalu-
ated, including sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV,
LRþ, and LR�. Estimates and 95% confidence in-
tervals (CIs) were determined for the NPV and PPV
parameters (13), and separately for LRþ and LR�
using a nonlinear mixed-effects model. The signifi-
cance of an elevated age-adjusted NT-proBNP value
was
further
assessed
by
multivariable
logistic
regression
analyses
using
backward
elimination.
Variables entered into the model were pre-specified
as: history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or
prior HF; history including a chief complaint of
orthopnea; physical examination findings of pulmo-
nary rales or peripheral edema; and testing results
including estimated glomerular filtration rate, chest
radiography revealing interstitial edema, as well as an
elevated age-adjusted NT-proBNP. Variables were
retained in the final model with an alpha level of 0.2;
odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were generated along
with estimation of an overall C-statistic for the model.
Based on data generated in the ICON study (9),
overall sensitivity and specificity of the proposed
age-dependent cutoffs were expected to be 90.0% and
84.0%, respectively. The expected prevalence of acute
HF was 50% with a PPV of 85.0%, and the LRþ was
expected to be 5.62. This expectation was based on the
prevalence observed in the original ICON study (9).
With 1,500 analyzable patients and an assumed HF
prevalence of 50% (9), the anticipated lower bounds
of a 95% 2-sided CI for the hypothesized PPV and
LRþ were 86.2% and 4.77, respectively (14). With
1,275 analyzable patients from the United States, the
lower bounds were anticipated to be 82.5% and 4.6
for PPV and LRþ, respectively.
The expected sensitivity and specificity values of
the rule-out cutoff of 300 pg/ml were 99.0% and
60.0%, respectively (9). Thus, the expected NPV was
98.5% (96.7% lower bound of the 95% CI) and the
expected LR� was 0.017 (0.034 upper bound of the

(12), analyses were performed in pre-specified diag-
nostic
subgroups.
Baseline
characteristics
were
compared between subjects with and without acute
HF, using the Student’s t test for continuous vari-
ables, the Pearson chi-square test for categorical
variables, and the Fisher exact test for categorical
variables with small counts.
RESULTS
A total of 1,758 patients were enrolled from October
30, 2015, to October 15, 2016. Of these, 297 were
excluded due to clinical or sample exclusion criteria,
leaving 1,461 enrolled, of which 1,424 were from the
United States and 37 were from Canada (Figure 1) (12).
DEMOGRAPHICS,
DIAGNOSIS,
AND
MEDICAL
HISTORY. As demonstrated in Table 1, 277 (19%) pa-
tients were diagnosed with acute HF and 1,184 (81%)
did not have acute HF after adjudication (site di-
agnoses for these 1,184 patients are displayed in Online
Table 1). This prevalence of 19% is significantly less
than the 50% prevalence that was assumed at the
outset of the trial, which had a significant effect on the
expected predictive values described earlier. Overall,
the mean patient age was 56.4 � 15.7 years, 49.1% were
female, and 36.6% were black; 63.3% had hyperten-
sion, and 24.9% had a history of prior HF. The most
recent left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) mea-
surement before enrollment, available in 28% of the
patients (405 of 1,461), was mean 51 � 17%. Asthma,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and a history
of lung cancer were present in 30.1%, 27.5%, and 2.8%
of the enrolled cohort, respectively; 58.5% of patients
reported being current or former smokers. Subjects
with acute HF were older and were more likely to have
diabetes, hypertension, prior HF, prior coronary artery
disease, chronic kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation
compared with those without acute HF (all p < 0.001).
Not surprisingly, those with acute HF were more likely
to have lower mean LVEF at the most recent evaluation
before enrollment. Additionally, most patients (58.7%)
with acute HF had LVEF <50%.
Baseline characteristics of the subgroup of patients
with acute HF, comparing those with reduced versus

NT-proBNP CONCENTRATIONS. The results of NT-
proBNP testing between those with and without
acute HF are shown in Figure 2. The median NT-
proBNP concentration of patients with acute HF
(2,844 pg/ml; interquartile range: 1,247 to 5,976 pg/ml)
was substantially higher than those without acute HF
(98 pg/ml; interquartile range: 35 to 369 pg/ml;
p < 0.001 for difference).
The ROC curve for all patients (Central Illustration,
panel A) demonstrated an area under the curve (AUC)
of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.90 to 0.93; p < 0.001). The AUCs
derived from the age categories are depicted in the
Central Illustration, panel B. Among patients <50
(n ¼ 462), 50 to 75 (n ¼ 833), and >75 years of age
(n ¼ 166), NT-proBNP had AUCs of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.94
to 0.99), 0.89 (95% CI: 0.87 to 0.92), and 0.84 (95% CI:
0.78 to 0.90), respectively, for the diagnosis of acute
HF (all p < 0.001).
CUTPOINT ANALYSIS: IDENTIFICATION OF ACUTE
HF. The diagnostic sensitivities, specificities, PPV
and NPV, and likelihood ratios for age-stratified
diagnostic cutpoints in the study population are
depicted in Table 2. This cutpoint strategy was asso-
ciated with PPVs (primary endpoint) of 53.6% (95%
CI: 43.7% to 63.2%), 58.4% (95% CI: 53.7% to 63.0%),
and 62.0% (95% CI: 53.3% to 70.0%) for the age-
dependent cutoffs of 450, 900, and 1,800 pg/ml,
respectively. The corresponding sensitivities for each
cutoff were 85.7% (95% CI: 74.1% to 97.3%), 79.3%
(95% CI: 73.5% to 85.2%), and 75.9% (95% CI: 64.8% to
86.9%), respectively. Results using the FDA-approved
NT-proBNP cutpoints (125 and 450 pg/ml) are pre-
sented in Online Table 3. The 125- and 450-pg/ml

 cutoffs were respectively associated with PPVs of
33.5% (95% CI: 31.7% to 35.3%) and 43.7% (95% CI:
40.5% to 46.8%); sensitivity of 96.7% (95% CI: 94.3%
to 99.1%) and 98.4% (95% CI: 95.3% to 100.0%).
Given a lower prevalence (19%) (Online Figure 1) of
acute HF than projected (which affects predictive
values), it is worthwhile to emphasize that the overall
LRþ for the age-stratified cutpoint strategy was as
predicted at 5.99 (95% CI: 5.05 to 6.93); LRþ values
for each cutoff were 14.08 (95% CI: 8.48 to 19.67),
4.95 (95% CI: 4.00 to 5.90), and 3.03 (95% CI: 1.94 to
4.13), respectively.
In multivariable logistic regression, an elevated
age-adjusted NT-proBNP had the highest OR of all
variables retained (OR: 11.80; 95% CI: 7.66 to 18.18;
p < 0.001). Other variables significantly predictive of
acute HF included prior HF (OR: 2.67; 95% CI: 1.76 to
4.07; p < 0.001), interstitial edema on chest radiog-
raphy (OR: 4.70; 95% CI: 2.67 to 8.27; p < 0.001), rales
on lung examination (OR: 2.56; 95% CI: 1.35 to 4.87;
p ¼ 0.004), and presence of peripheral edema on
physical examination (OR: 3.95; 95% CI: 2.56 to 6.09;
p < 0.001). The overall model C-statistic with these
variables was 0.933.
CUTPOINT ANALYSIS: EXCLUSION OF ACUTE HF.
The age-independent approach for ruling out acute
HF using the single cutpoint of 300 pg/ml exhibited
an NPV (primary endpoint) of 98.0% (95% CI: 96.9%
to 98.8%), and a specificity of 71.7% (95% CI: 69.1% to
74.3%). The LR� was 0.09 (95% CI: 0.05 to 0.13) in our
patient population (Table 2).

as demonstrated in Online Table 4.
DISCUSSION
Although widely used in U.S. clinical practice, the
age-stratified NT-proBNP rule-in cutpoint strategy for
diagnosis of acute HF and age-independent rule-out
cutpoint to exclude acute HF have not been pro-
spectively validated in a North American cohort. Our
results provide contemporary information about NT-
proBNP cutpoints to aid in the diagnosis and exclu-
sion of acute HF in a cohort of all-comer patients with
acute dyspnea presenting to EDs. Our study repre-
sents
a
diverse
range
of
patient
groups,
with
approximately
50%
women
and
more
than
40%
nonwhite patients. Results of the study indicate
excellent performance of NT-proBNP to identify or
exclude acute HF, and support the utility of the
widely-used age-stratified diagnostic approach for its
use, while also verifying high NPV of 300 pg/ml to
exclude acute HF.
Notably, the overall age of the patients diagnosed
with acute HF was relatively young in comparison to
other cohorts (2). The characteristics of participants
in this study are consistent with data suggesting that
the demographics of ED patients with acute HF, as
well as those of patients with measurable NT-proBNP,
have changed compared with the last major evalua-
tion 12 years ago (6,7). It is also noteworthy that the
prevalence of acute HF in this study of all-comers
with acute dyspnea (n ¼ 277; 19%) was considerably

 lower than projected (vs. 50%); in comparison, a
recent report from Singapore and New Zealand con-
firms reduced prevalence of HF in dyspneic patients
(36% and 24%, respectively) (19). This may suggest
use of the ED by patients with acute HF may be
declining, despite a rise in overall prevalence of the
diagnosis.
These
trends
may
be
caused
by
the
increasing use of programs aimed at reducing ED HF
visits, HF hospitalization, and HF rehospitalization
(20). Despite differences in demographics compared
with older studies and lower prevalence, NT-proBNP
had excellent sensitivity, specificity, and area under
the ROC for diagnosis of acute HF, and the age-
adjusted cutoff had an OR >10 for the diagnosis of
HF, substantially stronger than traditional variables
from history, physical examination, or other forms of
laboratory testing. Importantly, we noted lower than
expected PPV, which is explainable by the lower
prevalence of acute HF in this population; given the
lower-than-expected prevalence of acute HF (which
affects the stability of the statistical predictive value),
using LRþ and LR� may be a better approach for
assessing the performance of the test than PPV and
NPV.
Taken in context, the performance of NT-proBNP
in ICON-RELOADED compares favorably with other
large, pivotal trials of BNP and NT-proBNP testing
(Table 4). In this regard, compared with the first ICON
study, we found slightly higher overall LRþ (5.99 vs.
4.27) and slightly lower overall LR� (0.09 vs. 0.11). In
the balance, the LR results in the present study
confirm that elevated age-stratified cutoff results may
be used as an aid in the diagnosis of acute HF,
whereas an NT-proBNP concentration <300 pg/ml
provides a substantial ability to exclude the presence
of acute HF. Despite not being on the package insert,
the age-stratified approach has been incorporated in
clinical practice guidelines (5) and textbooks, and is
used globally at present. The FDA-approved cutoffs
are
for
outpatient
application,
in
particular,
for
excluding the presence of chronic HF on the basis of
their high NPV. In contrast, among a more acutely
dyspneic population, where natriuretic peptide as-
says are more widely used, these cutoffs deliver
reasonable NPV, but their PPV is undermined by the
lack of specificity. Clinicians should consider the
venue in which they are using NT-proBNP, and select
cutoffs
accordingly.
Having
consistency
in
FDA-
approved cutoffs, as well as clinical practice guide-
lines, would ease the confusion surrounding the
different cutoffs.

 confound the performance of NT-proBNP demon-
strated that the diagnostic and exclusionary perfor-
mance of the test remained accurate in these patient
subgroups, with consistent effects of sex and race
(15), abnormal renal function (16), obesity (17), and
atrial fibrillation (18) on sensitivity or specificity of
NT-proBNP.
Early and accurate diagnosis of patients with acute
dyspnea in the ED is essential, as delayed treatment
for acute HF is associated with increased mortality
(21). Studies from PRIDE (22,23), the Canadian-based
IMPROVE-CHF (Improved Management of Patients
with
Congestive
Heart
Failure)
study
(24),
the
ADHERE (Acute Decompensated Heart Failure Na-
tional Registry) analysis (25), and others (21) suggest
that prompt, accurate diagnosis reduces indecision,
potentially
improves
outcomes,
and
leads
to
a
reduction in health care expenditures. Validation of
the
ICON
diagnostic
cutoffs
in
an
all-comers,
contemporary cohort may thus aid in enhancing
diagnosis of acute HF in the ED.
STUDY LIMITATIONS. The clearest limitation of the
study is that fewer than expected patients with acute
HF were enrolled, which is reflected in the lower PPV
result, as PPV is largely dependent on the prevalence
of the disease. For example, the same assay tested
here would have a PPV of 80% to 90% if the preva-
lence of acute HF was 50%. As a matter of fact, the
PPV noted in this study was exactly as projected
based on the lower prevalence of acute HF (Online
Figure 1). In this regard, the use of LRþ to express
the performance of a test is arguably a more reliable
approach when comparing tests from 2 different
studies with different disease prevalence, and the
results confirm the expected performance of the age-
adjusted cutoff approach studied in this analysis.
Similarly, in the BNP (Breathing Not Properly) multi-
national study (4), which had a higher prevalence of
patients with HF (47%), the PPV was indeed higher
(71% to 83%, depending upon the BNP level), but the
LRþ was lower (3.4) when evaluating BNP $100 pg/ml
(26). As with BNP, certain clinical factors, such as
impaired renal function, can increase NT-proBNP
levels in the absence of HF and deliver a lower
specificity as well as PPV. However, age stratification
largely addresses the effects of renal function (16). As
seen in the AUC curve, using a higher NT-proBNP
cutpoint would result in better specificity and better
PPV, as was the case of BNP in the Breathing Not
Properly Study (4). Lower prevalence of acute HF in
this study likely reflects the evolution in practices
surrounding ED use for HF over the last decade, in
favor of urgent care and office-based practice. It is
important to note that despite the lower prevalence
of acute HF in the study cohort, the performance of
the cutoffs for exclusion of acute HF was great.
Lastly, because this study was conducted in the
United States and Canada, the generalizability of the
findings outside of this geographic region may be

The ICON-RELOADED study demonstrates that the
NT-proBNP cutoffs proposed in the first ICON study
perform consistently in a current, multicenter cohort
of all-comer patients. As in all prior studies of BNP or
NT-proBNP, our results confirm that elevated NT-
proBNP
may
aid
in
identification
of
acute
HF,
whereas an NT-proBNP <300 pg/ml provides a strong
ability to exclude acute HF. Despite changes in
prevalence, demographics, comorbidities, and man-
agement of patients with HF nearly 15 years after NT-
proBNP was first developed as a biomarker test, the
utility of the assay for both the diagnosis and exclu-
sion of acute HF in the ED setting endures.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN PATIENT CARE: For patients presenting to
the ED with acute dyspnea categorized by age <50, 50 to 75,
and $75 years, accurate diagnosis of HF may be based on ICON
NT-proBNP cutoff levels of 450, 900, and 1,800 pg/ml,
respectively, and acute HF is largely excluded when the level is
below 300 pg/ml.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Future studies should assess
the generalizability of these thresholds in patients evaluated in
other care settings and with manifestations of HF other than
dyspnea.
