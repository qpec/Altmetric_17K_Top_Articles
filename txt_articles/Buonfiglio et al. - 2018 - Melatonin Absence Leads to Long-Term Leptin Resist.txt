Melatonin (Mel), a molecule that conveys photoperiodic information to the organisms, is 
also involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis. Mechanisms of action of Mel in the 
energy balance remain unclear; herein we investigated how Mel regulates energy intake 
and expenditure to promote a proper energy balance. Male Wistar rats were assigned 
to control, control + Mel, pinealectomized (PINX) and PINX + Mel groups. To restore a 
24-h rhythm, Mel (1 mg/kg) was added to the drinking water exclusively during the dark 
phase for 13 weeks. After this treatment period, rats were subjected to a 24-h fasting 
test, an acute leptin responsiveness test and cold challenge. Mel treatment reduced 
food intake, body weight, and adiposity. When challenged to 24-h fasting, Mel-treated 
rats also showed reduced hyperphagia when the food was replaced. Remarkably, PINX 
rats exhibited leptin resistance; this was likely related to the capacity of leptin to affect 
body weight, food intake, and hypothalamic signal-transducer and activator of tran-
scription 3 phosphorylation, all of which were reduced. Mel treatment restored leptin 
sensitivity in PINX rats. An increased hypothalamic expression of agouti-related peptide 
(Agrp), neuropeptide Y, and Orexin was observed in the PINX group while Mel treatment 
reduced the expression of Agrp and Orexin. In addition, PINX rats presented lower UCP1 
protein levels in the brown adipose tissue and required higher tail vasoconstriction to 
get a proper thermogenic response to cold challenge. Our findings reveal a previously 
unrecognized interaction of Mel and leptin in the hypothalamus to regulate the energy 
balance. These findings may help to explain the high incidence of metabolic diseases in 
individuals exposed to light at night.

Body weight is the final result of an energy balance. The complex mechanism that controls food 
intake relies on the central nervous system and involves the hypothalamus, striatum, brain stem, 
and other structures. The hypothalamic food intake regulatory system is composed of orexigenic 
and anorexigenic neurons and by their post-synaptic targets in order to induce food intake or satiety.

Mel and Body Weight Regulation
Frontiers in Endocrinology | www.frontiersin.org
March 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 122
Many hormones and neurotransmitters affect this neural system 
causing changes in feeding behavior (1–3). Energy expenditure, 
on the other hand, depends on several physiological and behav-
ioral phenomena including the activation of the brown adipose 
tissue (BAT) (4). Besides energy intake and energy expenditure, 
energy storage is also pivotal for the energy balance and is 
regulated by several neural and endocrine factors such as insulin, 
leptin, glucocorticoids, and growth hormone (5).
Melatonin (Mel), the major circadian mediator of photoperi-
odic information to the central nervous system, promotes energy 
homeostasis regulating energy balance (6). Extensive data in dif-
ferent species show that Mel is involved in the regulation of the 
three major steps in energy balance: food intake, energy storage, 
and energy expenditure (7, 8). As a consequence, administration 
of Mel in drinking water or liquid diet leads to a reduction of body 
weight and abdominal fat in rodent models of hyperadiposity. In 
rats, Mel supplementation can reduce body weight and fat mass 
independently of food intake reduction (9–13). In the zebrafish 
Danio rerio, Mel inhibits orexigenic and stimulates anorexigenic 
signals in the CNS, leading to a reduction in food intake (14). 
Data from our group showed that rhythmic Mel treatment in vitro 
synchronizes the white adipocyte metabolic and hormonal func-
tions, including leptin secretion (15). More recently, Mel was 
shown to be a powerful synchronizing agent for leptin secretion 
in Syrian hamsters (16).
One of the main actions of Mel is to participate in the circadian 
organization of metabolic functions and their association to the 
circadian behavioral cycles regulating food intake and energy 
expenditure (6). Moreover, Mel drives the daily rhythmicity of 
plasma leptin and modulates the glycemic homeostasis accord-
ing to the photoperiod-dependent metabolic state (16). Mel is 
essential for coupling metabolic functions to the light–dark cycle 
ensuring metabolic homeostasis. The uncoupling of these func-
tions is related to metabolic syndrome and obesity.
Leptin is an important anorexigenic signal. It is produced 
and secreted mainly by adipocytes, in proportion to adipose 
mass (17). Most of the well-studied biological roles of leptin are 
CNS-mediated through the activation of its membrane recep-
tor (LepR). LepR belongs to the cytokine receptor superfamily 
and signals via a number of downstream pathways, including 
the Janus kinase 2 and the signal-transducer and activator of 
transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway. Phosphorylated STAT3 acts 
as a transcription factor that regulates the expression of target 
genes, including suppressor of cytokine signaling 3, a critical 
negative-feedback regulator of LepR signaling (18, 19). In the 
hypothalamus, the arcuate nucleus (ARH) is a fundamental 
site for leptin’s action. ARH is composed by different neuronal 
populations that express LepR, such as proopiomelanocortin 
(POMC) positive neurons that are stimulated by leptin. POMC 
can be cleaved in several peptides, including the α-melanocyte-
stimulating hormone (α-MSH) that has anorexigenic effects. In 
ARH, there is another population of neurons that co-express neu-
ropeptide Y (NPY) and the agouti-related protein (AgRP). The 
NPY/AgRP neurons present orexigenic effects and are inhibited 
by leptin. Leptin regulates energy stocks through its action in the 
CNS because of its direct access to neurons responsible for the 
feeding behavior and other aspects of energy metabolism (5, 20). 
Other important hormones for the regulation of energy balance 
are the anorexigenic cortico releasing hormone (CRH) released 
in the paraventricular nucleus which are suggested to mediate 
leptin’s effects on feeding and adiposity (21); and the orexigenic 
melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), which acts increasing 
AgRP/NPY and decreasing POMC/CART (22).
Leptin resistance and consequently, hyperleptinemia, seems to 
be one of the major causes of obesity. However, the mechanism 
through which leptin resistance is triggered has yet to be identi-
fied (23, 24).
Melatonin is critically involved in leptin synthesis and release 
by white adipocytes (15, 25, 26) and its absence is related to meta-
bolic syndrome, diabetes, and increased body weight. Moreover, 
the therapeutic replacement or supplementation of Mel reduces 
body weight by reducing adiposity, modulates energy expendi-
ture, and possibly food intake (6). Our hypothesis is that Mel 
or its absence modulate energy metabolism by acting in the 
leptin pathway. Notwithstanding this functional correlation, the 
molecular and signaling interactions between Mel and leptin 
actions remain unclear. Therefore, it becomes essential to deter-
mine how leptin signaling and behavioral effects are impacted 
by the absence of Mel and its replacement. Understanding the 
relationship among Mel, leptin and energy metabolism is critical 
to improving strategies to limit obesity, especially in individuals 
exposed to environmental factors and circadian disturbances that 
affect Mel secretion.

animals and general Procedures
Male Wistar rats were maintained under a 12-h light/12-h 
dark cycle at the animal facility room of the Neurobiology Lab, 
Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of São 
Paulo. All the experimental procedures were approved by the 
Ethics Committee on Animal Use of the Institute of Biomedical 
Sciences of the University of São Paulo, under the number 86/2016.
Animals were assigned to four groups: control, intact animals; 
control + Mel, intact animals that were supplemented with 
Mel; pinealectomized (PINX) animals; and PINX + Mel, PINX 
animals that were treated with Mel since the day of surgery. 
Mel (1 mg/kg of body weight) was added to the drinking water 
exclusively during the dark phase and the concentration in the 
drinking water solution was corrected on a daily basis using the 
previous night ingested volume and the body weight of each 
animal. To determine changes in energy balance, food intake, 
and body weight were measured three times a week. All groups 
were fed with regular chow; 2.99 kcal/g; 9.4% kcal derived from 
fat; Quimtia, Brazil. Table 1 summarizes the experimental setup.
Pinealectomy
Eight-week-old rats were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injec-
tion of ketamine and xilazin (0.15 ml/100 g body weight) and 
fixed in a stereotaxic apparatus. A sagittal opening was made on 
their scalp, after pushing the skin aside to expose the lambdoid 
suture, a disk-shaped perforation was made around the lambdoid 
suture by a circular drill, and a disk-shaped piece of bone was

delicately removed. The superficial pineal gland, located below 
the posterior venous sinus confluence, was removed using a fine 
forceps. After the pineal gland’s removal, the disk-shaped piece 
of bone was returned to the skull and the scalp was sutured with 
cotton threads after a brief hemostasis (27).
adiposity and hormone levels
Subcutaneous, perigonadal (PE), and retroperitoneal (RP) fat 
pads were collected and weighed to determine the amount of 
adipose tissue in each group. Fat mass was normalized by body 
weight for comparison between groups. Serum was collected 
from trunk blood for leptin and insulin measurements by 
MILLIPLEX® Multiplex Assays/Merck.
acute leptin sensitivity Test
To assess the acute sensitivity to leptin, animals received an intra-
peritoneal injection of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at ZT 10 
(2 h before the beginning of dark phase) and their food intake and 
body weight were recorded 12 and 24 h after injection. The day 
after, rats received an intraperitoneal injection of rat-recombinant 
leptin (0.6 mg/kg of body weight; from Dr. A. F. Parlow, National 
Hormone and Peptide Program, National Institute of Diabetes 
and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIH, USA) and their food 
intake and body weight were recorded 12 and 24 h after injection. 
The purpose of using a within-animal control was to minimize 
interindividual variability in the assessment of the anorexigenic 
effects of leptin. Therefore, each rat acts as its own control.
To evaluate leptin activation of its intracellular signaling path-
way, STAT3 phosphorylation was assessed after an acute leptin 
stimulus (0.6 mg/kg of body weight) (23, 28, 29). Rats (n = 5/
group) received an intraperitoneal injection of PBS or leptin and 
were euthanized 90 min later at ZT4. Hypothalami were collected 
and stored at −80°C for pSTAT3 western blot analysis.
24-h Fasting response
The 24-h fasting response was assessed by removing food from 
the cages and re-feeding all animals after 24 h. Body weight and 
food intake were monitored 6, 12, and 24 h after fasting and 6 and 
12 h after re-feeding.
intracerebroventricular (icV) Mel injection
Ten-week-old male Wistar rats were anesthetized with Xylazin 
and Ketamine i.p. (0.15 ml/100 g body weight) and placed in 
a stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf Instruments, CA, USA). 
One hole was drilled on the parietal bone (2.0 mm posterior 
to bregma, midline), the guide cannula was ventrally pushed 
into the third ventricle (7.5 mm from the skull) and fixed in 
a vertical position with dental cement (copolymer of acrylic 
and acrylic self-polymerizing Articles Dental Classic ®, São 
Paulo, SP, Brazil) and two lateral screws. In the rats of PINX 
group, the removal of the pineal gland was performed as 
previously described, immediately before the guide cannula 
implantation.
Intracerebroventricular injections were initiated 7 days after 
surgery. The daily injections started immediately before the light/
dark transition and the total volume injected was 5 µl of vehicle 
(Ringer’s solution: 147 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 
and 1.0 mM MgCl2) or 5 µl of Mel (18 ng/µl in vehicle). The 
solutions were maintained at 37°C. All animals were injected daily 
for 30 days and the 24-h food consumption was evaluated daily. 
The injection system consisted of a probe (0.28 mm diameter), a 
tubing adaptor, and polypropylene tubing that was connected to

membrane (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with 5% bovine 
serum albumin and incubated overnight at 4°C using commer-
cially available primary antibodies (1:1,000) to identify pSTAT-
3Tyr705 (Cell Signaling), UCP1 (Santa Cruz), or β-Actin (Sigma). 
Next, we incubated the membranes for 60 min in 1:20,000 
secondary antibody (IRDye 800CW, Li-COR). Proteins were 
detected by fluorescence, analyzed using the Li-COR Odyssey 
system (Li-COR), and normalized to β-actin or Ponceau staining 
(30).
Thermography—cold challenge
To assess the thermogenic responses to a cold challenge, animals 
were fasted overnight and individually placed in a 4-l glass 
beaker surrounded by ice at ZT15. The heat response of the BAT 
(maximum temperature irradiated from the dorsal interscapular 
region), maximum eye temperature, and temperature of the tail 
(average of tail temperature) were recorded, at baseline and after 
the cold challenge, with an infrared camera (Model: Sc6040—
Flir Systems) for 60 min each (capture rate: 0.2 frame/s). Each 
thermography has a 12-bit image (640 × 480 pixels) and was 
obtained in IR wavelength electromagnetic radiation (8–12 mm), 
and each pixel with 0.1°C resolution. The temperature of the 
environment and substrate were also obtained to correlate with 
the temperature of the body surface. For all measurements, emis-
sivity coefficient in the camera was set to 0.95 as estimated for 
biological tissues (31).
statistical analyses
Results are presented, as mean ± SEM. Data were assessed for 
normality and homogeneity of variance by D’Agostino-Pearson 
omnibus test. p-Values were determined according to each 
experimental design by t-test, one-way ANOVA or two-way 
ANOVA as presented in figures legend. The significance level was 
p < 0.05. Statistical analyses and graphics were performed using 
GraphPad Prism V.6 software.

Mel reduces Food intake, body Weight, 
and adiposity
The role of Mel in the regulation of energy balance was assessed 
by analyzing food intake, body weight, and adiposity of control, 
control + Mel, PINX, and PINX + Mel rats. Treated animals 
received Mel in the drinking water during the dark phase. 
Figure 1A shows that after 9 weeks of Mel treatment, body 
weight gain in the control + Mel and PINX + Mel groups began 
to fall behind of the control and PINX groups (**p < 0.005 vs 
control and PINX; ***p < 0.001 vs control and PINX), and after 
13 weeks (Figure 1C) the groups treated with Mel had a highly 
significant lower body weight (***p < 0.0001 vs control and 
PINX, **p < 0.0040 vs control and PINX). The same can be seen 
for food intake. The cumulative food intake curves for treated 
groups were below the respective untreated groups by 9 weeks 
of Mel treatment (Figure 1B; *p < 0.05 vs PINX and CTL; 
**p < 0.005 vs PINX and CTL), showing a clear significant effect 
at the end of the 13 weeks of treatment (Figure 1D; ***p < 0.0001 
a 10 µl Hamilton syringe. The system was fully filled with either 
vehicle or Mel solution prior to injection. The injection lasted 
about 2 min and the injection system allowed free movement for 
the animals during ICV injection.
analysis of genes involved in the 
hypothalamic control of Feeding behavior
To evaluate the expression of genes involved in feeding behavior, 
hypothalami were collected and submitted to RNA isolation by 
the guanidine isothiocyanate extraction method using TRIzol® 
Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The purity was 
assessed by the 260/280 nm ratio and the quantity measured at 
260 nm. After that, cDNA was synthesized from 1 µg of total RNA 
using the ImProm-II (Promega). Real-time PCR analysis of Npy, 
AgRP, Orexin, Mch, Pomc, Cart, and Crh genes were performed 
(Primers design, Table 2) by using Power SyBR Green (Applied 
Biosystems) in the QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR System 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). The data were analyzed by 2−ΔΔCT and 
normalized by geometric mean of Gapdh, Rpl, beta-actin, and 
HDAC.
Western blot analysis
Immediately after collection, the hypothalamus or BAT was 
homogenized in RIPA buffer (Sigma) containing a cocktail of 
protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1:100, Sigma), centrifuged 
(14,000 RPM, 4°C for 20 min) and the supernatants were retained. 
After determination of total protein concentration (Pierce BCA 
Protein Assay, Thermo Scientific) 50 µg of total protein was loaded 
in a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and finally transferred to a nitrocellulose

RP: *p < 0.05 vs control, **p < 0.001 vs PINX; PE: **p < 0.001 
vs control, *p < 0.01 vs PINX; SC: **p < 0.001 vs control). This 
result is in agreement with the serum leptin levels that were 
reduced in Mel-treated groups compared with control and PINX 
groups (Figure 2B; *p < 0.05 vs control group, **p < 0.01 vs 
PINX group). No statistical differences were found in serum 
insulin levels (Figure 2C).
Melatonin supplementation in the drinking water has a sys-
temic effect, affecting several physiological systems. On the other 
hand, central Mel infusion predominantly affects the CNS. To test 
if the reducing food intake effect of Mel was centrally mediated, 
ICV injections, into the third ventricle, of vehicle (ringer), or Mel 
were performed (Figure 3A). Mel ICV injection reduced food 
intake in both control and PINX groups, when compared with 
the respective vehicle-injected groups (group mean ± SEM of 30 
daily measurements for each animal; six experimental groups; 
****p < 0.0001 vs basal and vehicle).
Deficiency of Mel increases the 
expression of Orexigenic neuropeptides 
in the hypothalamus, Which is Prevented 
by Mel Treatment
Knowing that Mel acts on hypothalamus to reduce food intake, 
we analyzed the hypothalamic expression of genes related to 
feeding behavior (Figure 3B) in control, PINX and systemically 
Mel-treated groups. Concerning the orexigenic peptides, the 
gene expression of Npy was higher in both groups, PINX and 
PINX + Mel when compared with control group (*p < 0.02). NPY 
is co-localized with AgRP, another potent orexigenic peptide, and 
its expression conversely exhibited a significant reduction in the 
PINX + Mel group (#p < 0.0001) and an increase in the PINX 
group (*p < 0.005) when compared with control group. The Agrp 
transcripts reduction in the PINX + Mel group is in agreement 
with the food intake reduction that we observed in the animals 
treated with Mel. It is important to note that the magnitude of 
drop in Agrp expression is much greater than the rise of Npy 
transcripts, which may account for the anorexigenic effect of 
Mel. Contributing to the anorexigenic effect of Mel, the orexin 
transcripts were reduced in the PINX + Mel group compared 
with PINX (&p < 0.05). Mel treatment reduced Pomc gene expres-
sion compared with control and PINX groups (#p < 0.001). No 
differences were found in the Mch and Crh gene expression.
Mel Treatment Decreases hyperphagic 
response Following Fasting
To understand if the systemic-administered Mel or Mel absence 
could modulate fasting induced hyperphagia, the animals were 
tested after 24-h imposed fasting. As seen in Figure 4A, all groups 
lost weight progressively, reaching a 5% loss after 24 h of fasting 
and no differences were found between the groups. After 24 h 
of fasting, the rats were re-fed (Figure 4B). In the first 6 h of 
food availability, all groups recovered the weight lost during the 
fasting period and additionally gained body weight after 12 h 
of re-feeding (Figure 4B). Cumulative food intake was higher 
in the control and PINX groups compared with the respective 
Mel-treated groups (Figure 4C; *p < 0.05 vs PINX, **p < 0.005 
vs control and PINX), indicating that hyperphagia was higher in 
the groups that did not receive Mel.
acute leptin responsiveness Test: PinX 
rats showed no response to leptin 
injection
To unravel possible mechanisms by which Mel affects the energy 
balance, we assessed the acute anorexigenic response to leptin. 
Thus, all rats received an intraperitoneal injection of PBS or rat-
recombinant leptin 2 h before the dark phase and their food intake 
and body weight were recorded in the following 24 h. Compared 
with PBS injection, control, control + Mel, and PINX + Mel groups

had a significant reduction in body weight gain. Remarkably, 
PINX group did not reduce the body weight in response to leptin 
(Figure 5A, **p < 0.0077 vs PBS and *p < 0.01 vs PBS), suggesting 
that Mel deficiency causes leptin resistance. The same result was 
observed in food intake after leptin injection. PINX group did 
not reduce their food intake in response to leptin (Figure 5B, 
*p < 0.05 vs PBS). Leptin causes an anorexigenic response via 
activation of leptin receptor signaling pathways in hypothalamic 
neurons. To further evaluate leptin sensitivity, the capacity of lep-
tin to induce STAT3 phosphorylation in the hypothalamus was

analyzed (Figures 5C,D). Leptin evoked STAT3 phosphorylation 
in control, control + Mel, and PINX + Mel groups (*p < 0.05 
vs PBS). In accordance with the food intake and body weight 
results, leptin failed to induce in STAT3 phosphorylation beyond 
the observed in PBS-treated rats (p = 0.8360).
PinX rats had lower UcP1 Protein levels 
in the baT and showed intolerance to cold
The effects of Mel in the energy homeostasis may not be restricted 
to food intake. To investigate if Mel also modulates biological 
functions related to energy expenditure, the BAT of control, and 
PINX rats was studied. We first quantified the levels of UCP1 pro-
tein in the BAT by western blot (Figures 6A,B) and Mel absence 
reduced UCP1 levels compared with control and PINX + Mel 
groups (&p < 0.05). To evaluate if the reduction of UCP1 resulted 
in a lower thermogenic response of BAT, we performed a cold 
challenge test (Figures 6C,D). We first collected the thermal imag-
ing of eyes, BAT and tail in basal condition (25°C), near what is 
considered thermal comfort for the animals. No differences were 
observed in these areas in both groups (Figure 6C, beige-line). 
Following the cold challenge, the main difference between the 
groups in thermal imaging was in the tail temperature. PINX rats 
had a more significant drop in tail temperature than the control 
group (Figure 6C, purple-line and Figure 6D, p < 0.05). In attempt 
to get a better visualization of BAT, we shaved the dorsal surface 
of the animals and performed the cold challenge. Again, PINX 
groups had a greater vasoconstriction in the tails when exposed 
to cold and no differences were detected in eye or BAT compared 
with control (Figure 6D, p < 0.04).

PinX led to late-Onset hyperphagia and 
Overweight
Initially, we found that PINX animals are centrally resistant to 
leptin after 13 weeks of pinealectomy (Figure 5C), but they do 
not present differences in body weight and food intake compared 
with control group (Figures 1C,D); moreover, they have lower 
levels of UCP1 (Figure 6A). Consequently, we would expect that 
they would have a higher body weight and increased food intake 
compared with controls. In order to determine the long-term 
metabolic consequences of Mel deficiency, we followed the body 
weight gain and food intake of PINX and control animals for 
9 months (Figure 7). Chronic pinealectomy leads to an increase 
in food intake (Figures 7B,D, *p < 0.05 and ****p < 0.0001 vs 
control) and a significant increase in body weight 9 months 
after pinealectomy surgery (Figures 7A,C, *p < 0.05 vs control). 
So, taken together these results show that Mel deficiency leads 
to central leptin resistance in a progressive phenomenon that 
culminates in increased food intake and body weight.
DiscUssiOn
In the present study, for the first time to our knowledge, we demon-
strated that the absence of pineal Mel leads to a progressive leptin 
resistance. In addition, we demonstrated that the absence of Mel 
reduced BAT activity, measured by UCP1 levels, alterations in the 
thermoregulatory mechanisms, increased food intake, resulting 
in a syndrome that culminates in increased body weight. On the 
other hand, we show that Mel treatment reduced food intake and 
body weight, due to its action on the hypothalamus modulating 
the expression of peptides that are related to food intake.
Some studies have already described the effects of oral Mel 
supplementation on adiposity reduction and body weight loss in 
middle-aged rats (9, 10, 32). In contrast to our findings, these 
reports did not find alterations in food intake, only in feed effi-
ciency. It is important to note that they fed animals with powdered 
chow (9) what might have led to a different result. In agreement to 
our work, they found that Mel supplementation reduced plasma 
leptin levels to the same levels of young animals (9, 32).
The same effect on food intake was demonstrated either 
when Mel was directly injected in the third ventricle, or orally 
administered. This result highlights the fact that Mel, in order 
to modulate food intake, seems to act directly on hypothalamic 
nuclei and circuits. More recently, MT2 receptor immunoreactiv-
ity was moderately detected in the ventral part of the ARH and 
the medial eminence (33), fundamental areas in the control of 
food intake that are also target sites for leptin action. Based on 
these observations, we propose that Mel may modulate feeding 
behavior by acting directly in the ARH.
An additional means by which Mel may modulate food intake 
is via an action on the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus 
(SCN), a region rich in MT1 and MT2 Mel receptors (33). Mel 
modulation in the SCN is usually associated to its chronobi-
otic effects, controlling the mechanism of the circadian clock 
 10

(34–36) acting through MT2. Additionally by acting on MT1, 
Mel modulates the firing rate of SCN neurons, modulating 
signal transmission down its projections pathways. Recently, 
Buijs et al. (37) demonstrated that SCN interaction with the 
ARH is essential for circadian rhythmicity. They observed that 
interruption of SCN-ARH communication desynchronizes 
the ARH causing animals to lose locomotor activity, body 
temperature, and corticosterone secretion circadian rhythms, 
without affecting the rhythmicity of the SCN itself. As well 
documented (6), Mel participates in the circadian organization 
of energy balance and its association to the circadian activity-
feeding—high-energy 
expenditure/rest-fasting—low-energy 
expenditure cycle. This system would be an indirect and com-
plementary way of Mel modulating energy metabolism and the 
SCN, another putative central nucleus where Mel and leptin 
action might interact, in addition to the ARH (38). However, 
since our analysis were performed on whole hypothalamus 
we cannot specify the interaction between SCN and ARH as 
responsible for the phenotype we observed, further studies 
on micro dissected nuclei are needed to elucidate better the 
mechanism underneath.
Melatonin caused a significant reduction in the Agrp tran-
scripts and the absence of Mel in the PINX groups led to increased 
levels of Agrp mRNA expression. This result is of particular inter-
est because AgRP neurons are sufficient to orchestrate feeding 
behavior even under physiological, circadian, and hypothalamic 
gene expression conditions that are typically associated with 
satiety. AgRP neurons evoke feeding response independently of 
suppression of melanocortin pathway (39).
Examination at the global pattern of gene expression of 
appetite-related peptides in the hypothalamus, we noticed that in 
the PINX group Npy and Agrp gene expressions are upregulated 
and Pomc and Cart gene expressions show a tendency to be 
downregulated, which justifies the increase of food intake in the 
long-term after the pinealectomy. PINX + Mel group also pre-
sented upregulated Npy gene expression but, in a compensatory 
mechanism, Agrp mRNA expression dropped almost 50% and a 
downregulation in orexin was also observed. Thus, the balance 
between orexigenic and anorexigenic peptides in the Mel-treated 
group results in a negative feeding balance.
Consistent with the present work in mammals, data from other 
species also showed a similar anorexic effect of Mel (14, 40–42). In 
zebrafish (Danio rerio), Mel significantly reduces food intake and 
the reduction is in agreement with the changes observed at the 
molecular level, a significant rise in genes enconding molecules 
involved in feeding inhibition, such as leptin and MC4R, and a 
significant reduction in the orexigenic signals including ghrelin 
and NPY (14). In goldfish (Carassius auratus), intraperitoneal 
injection of Mel or its agonist 2-iodomelatonin significantly 
decreased food intake (40). Similarly, it has been shown that Mel 
inhibits feeding behavior in European sea bass (Dicentrarchus 
labrax) in a dose-dependent manner when administered orally 
in gelatin capsules (41).
To evaluate the hypophagia induced by leptin, food intake, 
and body weight were assessed after an acute intraperitoneal 
leptin injection and compared with previous PBS injection. 
Control, control + Mel, and PINX + Mel showed significantly 
reduced food intake and body weight while PINX group did not 
respond to the leptin injection. As previous mentioned, leptin 
actions are mediated by Jak-Stat3 pathway; under that circum-
stance, hypothalamic phosphorylation of STAT3 was assessed. 
Once again, leptin did not evoke phosphorylation of STAT3 in 
the PINX group, indicating a putative state of leptin resistance. 
These results indicate that Mel is required to maintain leptin 
sensitivity, independent of body adiposity. The present work 
is the first, to our knowledge, to demonstrate that the absence 
of pineal Mel leads to leptin resistance—the basis of obesity. 
This finding is very important because previous data show a 
correlation between several states characterized by reduction 
in Mel production as, aging, diabetes, shift work, exposure to 
artificial light at night, with obesity (6, 43). In particular, aging 
constitutes a complex and dynamic process where, among other 
features, mechanisms regulating energy balance are changing 
in comparison with young individuals. At middle age, i.e., 
5 months, rats show decreased energy expenditure and respon-
siveness to anorexigenic hormones such as α-MSH, and these 
changes develop further until they reach a nadir at 12 months 
of age (44). In our study, we show that Mel treatment reduces 
body weight in 5-month-old rats, which suggests interaction 
of Mel in the melanocortin system and the regulation of body 
weight with age.
Hyperleptinemia is another feature of leptin resistance. It was 
shown that pinealectomy resulted in elevated circulating leptin 
levels, whereas the circadian rhythm of leptin secretion remained 
conserved (45, 46). Although our results did not show a differ-
ence in the circulating leptin concentration between control and 
PINX groups, they do show that circadian Mel treatment reduced 
circulating leptin both in intact and PINX rats.
Another important finding in the present study is that PINX 
rats have lower levels of UCP1 protein in the BAT compared 
with control. Moreover, Mel replacement therapy in PINX 
rats is able to restore UCP1 expression in the interscapular 
BAT to the levels of the intact animals. BAT is involved in 
non-shivering thermogenesis and due to its high-metabolic 
activity, is the major determinant of energy expenditure (47, 
48). Furthermore, it is known that Mel has a hypertrophic role 
in BAT (49). Moreover, Teodoro et al. (50) showed that absence 
of Mel reduces BAT-dependent energy expenditure during the 
active circadian phase of rats and Mel replacement increases 
the energy expenditure.
Tan et al. (49) hypothesize that there is an association between 
Mel synthesis reduction—for example, by night light exposure 
or aging—and body weight gain. They postulate that if Mel acts 
recruiting BAT in humans like in small mammals, people exposed 
to daily long photoperiods should have less functional BAT and 
may gain more body weight.
The effect of Mel in thermoregulation comes from the dis-
covery of its receptors in specific arteries of rats, including the 
caudal artery (51), this indicates that Mel may modulate body 
temperature also through tail-heat loss. Besides that, more 
recently, it was demonstrated that leptin modulates body tem-
perature by controlling tail-heat loss (52). In the present work, 
when the animals were cold challenged, PINX animals increased 
the vasoconstriction in the tail to decrease the tail-heat loss 
 11

to maintain a proper body temperature. This result points, as 
expected, to a lower recruitment of BAT in the PINX rats in spite 
of the present thermographic image does not show the putative 
difference between the groups.
It should also be noted that leptin actions are partly medi-
ated by the ERK pathway. The anorectic response to leptin can 
be reversed by blockade of PI3-kinase and ERK. Hypothalamic 
ERK is a significant downstream target for the effects of leptin to 
regulate food intake, body weight, and thermogenic sympathetic 
outflow to BAT. Also, reduced PI3K activity in neurons of the ven-
tromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus leads to a reduction in the 
thermogenic functions of BAT by suppressing UCP1 expression, 
indicating PI3K signaling in those neurons is required for medi-
ating acute effects of exogenous leptin on energy homeostasis (53, 
54). Mel is known to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1/
PI3K “per se” when injected directly into the lateral ventricle (55). 
So, considering that the absence of pineal Mel could also impair 
this alternative pathway, further analysis is necessary to elucidate 
that mechanism.
Collectively, these results show that the absence of circulat-
ing pineal Mel leads to leptin resistance and in a long-term 
increase of energy intake. At the same time, a reduction of energy 
expenditure occurs which explains the increasing in body weight 
of PINX animals. Conversely, when Mel was administrated, an 
anti-obesogenic effect was observed.
