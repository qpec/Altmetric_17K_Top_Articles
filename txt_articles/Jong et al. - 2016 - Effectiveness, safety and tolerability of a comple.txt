Abstract
Background: The present study was initiated to investigate the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of complex
homeopathic CalSuli-4-02 tablets on prevention of recurrent acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) in
children, in comparison to another complex homeopathic product.
Methods: The study was designed as a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open, clinical trial with two parallel
treatment groups at four outpatient pediatric clinics in Russia. Children aged ≤ 6 years with susceptibility to acute
URTIs (≥ three occasions during the last 6 months) were randomized to receive either CalSuli-4-02 or a comparator
homeopathic product (control group) for 3 weeks. Primary outcome was the frequency of acute URTIs after 3 and 6
months post-treatment follow-up. Secondary endpoints were changes in complaints and symptoms (total and
individual scores), treatment satisfaction, antibiotic use, safety and tolerability.
Results: The intention-to-treat analysis involved 200 children (CalSuli-4-02: N = 99, Control: N = 101). In both
treatment groups, the median number of acute URTIs was one for 3 months and two, respectively, for the full 6
months post-treatment (Relative Risk: 0.86 (95 %-CI: 0.72–1.03), p = 0.1099). Seasons had no influence on the
outcome. At the end of study, CalSuli-4-02 had overall higher odds of getting lower complaints severity total score
(Odds ratio: 1.99 (95 %-CI: 1.31–3.02), p = 0.0012) and showing symptom improvement (Odds ratio: 1.93
(95 %-CI: 1.25–3.00), p = 0.0033). Specifically, the complaint “appetite disorder” and the symptom “child’s activities”
significantly improved more in the CalSuli-4-02 group (p = 0.0135 and p = 0.0063, respectively). Antibiotic use was
decreased in both treatment groups at the study end. Overall assessment for satisfaction with and tolerability of
treatment was higher with CalSuli-4-02. A low number of non-serious adverse drug reactions was reported
(CalSuli-4-02: N = 4, Control: N = 1).

Conclusions: Both complex homeopathic products led to a comparable reduction of URTIs. In the CalSuli-4-02
group, significantly less URTI-related complaints and symptoms and higher treatment satisfaction and tolerability
were detected. The observation that the use of antibiotics was reduced upon treatment with the complex
homeopathic medications, without the occurrence of complications, is interesting and warrants further
investigations on the potential of CalSuli-4-02 as an antibiotic sparing option.

Background
Acute upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) and acute
ear, nose and throat (ENT)-diseases such as the common
cold, otitis media, sinusitis, pharyngitis and tonsillitis fre-
quently occur in young children [1, 2]. URTIs are often
viral conditions that are self-limiting in nature. Standard
care often involves symptom management with medica-
tions such as cough and cold preparations and nasal de-
congestants. Antibiotics are also frequently prescribed for
URTIs, despite the fact that they are often not indicated as
in most cases URTIs are viral in origin [3]. A recent phar-
macoepidemiologic study demonstrated that homeopathic
medications were the second most frequently used medi-
cations in Germany to treat URTIs in children [4]. Hom-
eopathy was developed by the German physician and
chemist Samuel Hahnemann and homeopathic medica-
tions are manufactured from herbal, mineral, animal, or
other natural substances and diluted through concessive
rounds of vigorous shaking [5, 6]. The dilution factors of
the homeopathic medications are mostly described as
1/10 dilution ratio steps (D-series) or 1/100 dilution
ratio steps (C-series) [5, 6]. Worldwide, many children
are treated by homeopathy [7–9]. Either through self-
management (bought over the counter) or prescription by
homeopathic practitioners, children can be treated indi-
vidually with single homeopathic medications, based on
the totality of the symptom pattern that the child presents.
Children may also use complex homeopathic medications,
containing usually two to six active homeopathic sub-
stances, which are sold over the counter for self-limiting
conditions [5, 6]. According to a review, prevalence rates
for the use of homeopathy are the highest in Germany,
UK and Canada and range altogether for all involved
countries from 0.8 to 39 % for lifetime use and from 1 to
14.3 % for current use [8]. Of all pediatric illnesses, par-
ents most frequently seek homeopathy to treat respiratory
complaints in their children and the rationale for parents
to choose homeopathy for their children is predominantly
guided by advice and good experience of family and
friends [10, 11].
Several studies have been performed suggesting that
homeopathy may be effective in the treatment of URTIs
in children. A study by Haidvogl et al. [12] demonstrated
that overall, individual homeopathic treatment in chil-
dren is just as effective in the treatment of acute URTIs
compared to standard, conventional care; however onset
of improvement within the first seven days after treat-
ment was significantly faster upon homeopathic treat-
ment. In two other studies, one in children with acute
otitis media treated with individual homeopathic treat-
ment [13] and one in children and adults with feverish
URTIs receiving a complex homeopathic medicinal
product as add-on to conventional treatment [14], initial
symptomatic improvement was significantly faster upon
homeopathic treatment compared to conventional treat-
ment alone. A placebo-controlled study with complex
homeopathic ear drops demonstrated that homeopathy
was moderately effective in treating acute otitis media in
children, but also more effective in the early period after
diagnosis [15]. A systematic review concluded overall
that homeopathic treatments may help decrease pain
and lead to faster resolution of acute otitis media [16].
Besides possible effectiveness of homeopathy in the
treatment of URTIs, previous studies have also reported
promising effects of homeopathic treatment in the pre-
vention of URTIs in children. Evaluation of thirty case
series demonstrated that the average number of URTIs
significantly decreased upon individualized homeopathic
treatment compared to before the start of treatment
[17]. In addition, a randomized study with a waiting list
control group showed that children receiving individual-
ized homeopathic treatment experience fewer days with
URTIs and fewer symptoms from the URTIs than those
in the control group [18]. All these studies indicate that
homeopathic treatment, both individually prescribed
homeopathic and complex homeopathic medications,
may be beneficial in the treatment of URTIs in children
but also in their prevention by empowering the child’s
immune system along with decreasing the child’s suscep-
tibility to catch infections.
The complex homeopathic medication, CalSuli-4-02
tablets (Immunokind®, Deutsche Homöopathie-Union,
DHU-Arzneimittel GmbH & Co. KG), is sold over the
counter in many European and non-European countries

 for increase resistance to recurring URTIs in infants and
children of early age. Originally, it was developed in the
Netherlands by homeopathic physicians and marketed
since 1984. The present randomized, controlled clinical
trial aimed to investigate the effectiveness, safety and
tolerability of CalSuli-4-02 tablets in the prevention of
recurrent acute URTIs in children. The study was di-
rected to the effect of the complex homeopathic medica-
tion rather than to the homeopathic care. Since this
clinical trial was initiated as to require marketing
authorization
in
the
Russian
Federation
(RF),
the
Russian regulatory authorities requested to compare the
effectiveness and safety of CalSuli-4-02 tablets with a
comparator homeopathic product, already marketed in
the RF for prevention of URTIs.
Methods
Trial design
A
prospective,
multicenter,
randomized,
open-label,
comparative, controlled clinical trial with two parallel
groups was conducted in the RF, in accordance with the
legislation of the RF and its national standards of Good
Clinical Practice. The study protocol was approved by
the independent Ethics Committee of the RF (Protocol
No. 50, November 11, 2009), the local Ethics Committees
of the four participating study centers and by the regula-
tory authorities of the Ministry of Health and Social
Development of the RF (Protocol No. 563, December 28,
2009). On December 31, 2010, approval for a 1-year
prolongation of the clinical study (Protocol No. 563) was
obtained from the Ministry of Health and Social Develop-
ment of the RF. The data of the present clinical trial were
first analyzed in RF and submitted to the Ministry of
Health and Social Development of the RF in December
2011. The data presented in this publication are based on
a new analysis from 2014 to 2015, in line with Inter-
national Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines.
Participants
Children were allowed to participate in the study if they
met the following inclusion criteria: boy or girl, up to 6
years of age, three or more episodes of acute URTIs (diag-
nosis based on World Health Organization (WHO) Inter-
national statistical Classification of Diseases and related
health problems (ICD)-10 code J06.9 documented in the
child’s medical record) in the last 6 months prior to the
study start, and signed informed consent from parents for
participation of their child in the study. Children were
excluded from participation if they had an acute URTI or
exacerbation of a chronic URTI upon starting the study,
severe concomitant diseases (renal failure, heart anomal-
ies, circulatory failure, cardiomyopathy, decompensated
kidney and liver, immunosuppressive conditions, onco-
logical diseases), known or suspected hypersensitivity to
any component of the study medication, or in case of
participation in other clinical studies or use of immune-
modulatory medications or being vaccinated against influ-
enza within the last 6 months before the start of the study.
During the study period children were not allowed to use
immune-modulatory medications and prophylactic medi-
cations for URTIs, or being vaccinated. The study took
place at four outpatient pediatric clinics in the RF: the
State Educational Institution for Additional Professional
Education (Russian Medical Academy of Postgraduational
Education) and the State Educational Institution for
Higher Professional Education (Russian State Medical Uni-
versity) in Moscow, the State Educational Institution for
Higher Professional Education (Smolensk State Medical
Academy) in Smolensk, and the State Educational Institu-
tion for Higher Professional Education (Nizhegorodksaya
State Medical Academy) in Nizhniy Novgorod. Pediatri-
cians of all four participating clinics informed parents of
children with frequent acute URTIs about the study and di-
rected them to the study investigators, who consequently
invited them to take part in the study, until the planned
sample size was reached. The first child was included in the
study on February 15, 2010 and the last child completed
the study on September 7, 2011.
Interventions
The intervention group was treated with the investiga-
tional product CalSuli-4-02 tablets for a period of 3
weeks with a dosage regimen of one tablet, three times a
day. For children aged < 3 years the CalSuli-4-02 tablet
was dissolved in 5 ml (1 teaspoon) water to facilitate in-
take. CalSuli-4-02 is a complex homeopathic medicinal
product containing four active ingredients: Calcium
carbonicum Hahnemanni D6, Calcium fluoratum D6,
Calcium phosphoricum D6 and Sulfur jodatum D12.
The control group was treated for a period of 3 weeks
with a comparator complex homeopathic medicinal
product that consisted of the following five active ingre-
dients: Gentiana D1, Aconitum D6, Bryonia D6, Ferrum
phosphoricum D12, and Acidum sarcolacticum D12. For
children aged < 1 year, half of a tablet of the comparator
product was dissolved in one teaspoon of water or breast
milk and one drop of that solution was administered
two times a day. For children aged 1–6 years, half a tab-
let was administered two times a day. In case of acute
URTIs and other ENT diseases during the study period,
the children’s symptoms were treated with antipyretics
and/or other symptomatic treatments (e.g. antitussives,
nasal decongestants, ear drops and throat gargle). If in-
dicated, antibiotics were prescribed. The use of any kind
of drug was documented in the child’s medical record,
which was kept by the parents. Concomitant medication
was not additionally included in trial documentation and
monitoring.

 A total of five study visits were scheduled and 200
children were planned to be randomly allocated either to
the CalSuli-4-02 or control group. After the start of
treatment, four follow-up (FU) Visits took place. The 1st
FU Visit was 3-5 days and the 2nd FU Visit 3 weeks (21
days) after the start of study treatment. The 2nd FU Visit
was also the end of treatment period and the study
medication was returned. The 3rd FU Visit was 3 months
post-treatment and the last Visit (Termination Visit), 6
months post-treatment. The individual duration for chil-
dren in the study, therefore, added up to 201 days, in-
cluding the 3 weeks (21 days) treatment and 6 months
post-treatment period. Every time during the follow-up
period when a child felt sick with acute complaints in
the
upper
respiratory
tract,
the
child
consulted
a
pediatrician. The pediatrician assessed the clinical symp-
toms and the primary diagnosis according to classifica-
tion of WHO ICD-10, which was documented in the
child’s medical record. In case the clinical symptoms ap-
plied to an acute URTI, the WHO ICD-10 code J06.9
was documented and the case was counted as acute
URTI for study purposes.
Outcome
The objective of the study was to assess the effectiveness,
safety and tolerability of CalSuli-4-02 compared to an-
other complex homeopathic medicinal product in the pre-
vention of acute URTIs in children. The primary outcome
parameter was the frequency of acute URTIs assessed at
the 3rd FU Visit (1–3 months post-treatment) and at
Termination Visit (4–6 months and full 6 months post-
treatment) by means of documented URTIs (WHO ICD-
10 code J06.9) in the child’s medical record within the
respective time period. Secondary outcome parameters
were changes in total scores and severity of individual
complaints (fatigability, cough, nasal discharge (blocked/
runny nose), appetite disorder, irritability – each of the
above with a maximum of two points, and a maximum
total score of ten points) and objective or symptoms
examined by the investigator (fever, nasal discharge
(rhinorrhea/mucopurulent), skin pallor, rales in lungs,
restlessness for unknown reason, atopic dermatitis mani-
festations, child’s activities impairment – each of the above
with a maximum score of two points, except atopic
dermatitis: maximum four points and skin pallor: max-
imum one point, and a maximum total score of 15 points).
Complaints and objectives were evaluated and scored at
each visit by the investigator either according to chil-
dren’s/parents’ self-report or according to the child’s
examination results. The total scores were calculated
by the investigator based on the single answers. Other sec-
ondary outcome was treatment satisfaction assessment by
children/parents using the 5-point verbal rating Integra-
tive Medicine Patient Satisfaction Scale (IMPSS, very
satisfied, satisfied, neutral, dissatisfied, very dissatisfied
[19]) at the 2nd, 3rd FU and Termination Visit. Further-
more, the use of antibiotics with respect to treatment of
URTIs and other ENT diseases such as sinusitis, otitis
media and bronchitis was assessed as always (used in all
occasions that there was an URTI/ENT), sometimes (esti-
mated by the physician), seldom (estimated by the phys-
ician) or never (in none of the occasions antibiotics were
used), based on the documentation in the child’s medical
record at baseline, 3rd FU and Termination Visit. Second-
ary outcome regarding safety of study treatment was
assessed by systematic review of the incidence of adverse
events (AEs) and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Toler-
ability of treatment was evaluated by investigator’s and
children’s/parents’ assessment using a 4-point verbal rat-
ing scale (excellent, good, satisfactory, poor) at the 1st, 2nd
FU and Termination Visit.
Sample size
The study has an explorative character and, therefore, a
formal sample size calculation was not necessarily re-
quired. However, the planned number of children had
been justified as follows: a treatment related difference
in acute URTI occurrence of one event was assumed as
clinical meaningful difference and simulations (Poisson
regression modelling) with the sample size of 100 chil-
dren in each treatment group were performed to obtain
the power of the study. It was calculated that if the mean
number of acute URTIs 1 year prior to study start, is
four or less, and a difference of one event is taken into
account, the study would have more than 82.8 % power
to detect the effect (0.05 % alpha level).
Randomization
The randomization list was generated by the Laboratory
of Biostatistics State Research Center for Preventative
Medicine (Moscow, RF) and the random block size was
four. At each center, children were assigned a study num-
ber in ascending order based on entry in the study. For
each study number, the investigator received a sealed en-
velope containing the name of the investigational product
to be given to the child according to the randomization
list. The envelope was opened after the children’s parents
had provided signed informed consent.
Statistical methods
All effectiveness analyses were based on the intention-
to-treat (ITT) analysis principle. The ITT population
included those children who were randomized, had re-
ceived at least one dose of study medication and had at
least one post-baseline response measurement. Safety
analysis included all randomized children, who received
at least one dose of study medication. The homogeneity
of the two treatment groups was assessed by regarding

 possible clinical relevance of group specific differences
of (demographic) data at baseline. Primary outcome data
were presented by descriptive statistics. As primary ana-
lysis method, post-treatment frequencies of acute URTIs
were
investigated
by
Poisson
regression
modelling.
Treatment related difference in response was reported
as relative risk (RR) presented with their 95 %-confidence
interval (CI) and related p-values. Secondary variables
were presented by descriptive statistics. To test for treat-
ment related differences ordinal logistic regression using
the proportional odds model (POM) and repeated mea-
sures of covariance analysis (ANCOVA) were applied for
change of complaints and symptoms severity total score.
For the other secondary variables chi-square (χ2)-tests
were performed to test for treatment related differences.
A rejection-criterion of 0.05 was set for all statistical tests.
If tests allowed, the statistics were two-tailed.
Results
Study population
Figure 1 depicts a flow diagram of the 201 children
(CalSuli-4-02: N = 100, Control: N = 101) enrolled in the
study. The ITT analysis consisted of 200 children
(CalSuli-4-02: N = 99, Control: N = 101), since one child
in the CalSuli-4-02 group didn’t take study medication.
With respect to demographic and clinical characteristics,
no clinically relevant differences were observed between
the two treatment groups (Table 1). The number of
acute URTIs in the 12 months period prior to study start
was 6.0 (median) in both treatment groups (Table 1),
whereof at least three acute URTIs per child were in the
last 6 months prior to study start.
Primary outcome parameter
In both treatment groups, the median number of acute
URTIs was two for the full 6 months of post-treatment.
These were subdivided into one each for the months 1–
3 as well as 4–6 of post-treatment (Table 2). Baseline ad-
justed Poisson regression modelling demonstrated that
the risk of experiencing acute URTIs within the full 6
months of post-treatment was comparable in both treat-
ment groups (RR in Table 2 and Fig. 2). The observed ef-
fect of RR = 0.86 (95 %-CI: 0.72–1.03) indicated a
slightly lower risk of experiencing acute URTIs in the
CalSuli-4-02 group compared to the control group.
However, the effect was not statistically significant (p =
0.1099; ITT). Comparable results were obtained for the
post-treatment periods of 1–3 and 4–6 months (Table 2
and Fig. 2). Further baseline-adjusted Poisson regression
model analysis demonstrated that the covariates seasonal
influence and prior antibiotics use had no significant in-
fluence on the frequency of acute URTIs (results not
shown).
Secondary outcome parameter: complaints and
symptoms severity total score
The complaints and symptoms severity total score were
already low in both treatment groups at baseline (median
3.0 points, out of 10.0 points and 15.0 points maximum,
respectively), but further decreased until Termination
Visit (Table 3). Within both treatment groups the decrease
from baseline to the respective Visits was significant
(ANCOVA: p < 0.05 for all post-baseline Visits; ITT). In a
baseline adjusted POM, children receiving CalSuli-4-02
had overall higher odds of showing improvement by
means of getting lower complaints severity total score
(Odds ratio (OR): 1.99 (95 %-CI: 1.31–3.02), p = 0.0012;
ITT) and lower symptoms severity total score (OR: 1.93
(95 %-CI: 1.25–3.00), p = 0.0033, ITT) as those receiving
the comparator homeopathic product.
Secondary outcome parameter: severity of individual
complaints and symptoms
Improvement of individual complaints’ and symptoms’
severity was observed in both treatment groups during
the course of the study (results not shown) and the
number of children with absence of the respective com-
plaint and symptom increased over the time of the study
period (Tables 4 and 5). Thus it can be subsumed in the
statement that at Termination Visit each respective indi-
vidual complaint was absent in minimum 81 out of 99
(81.8 %) children in the CalSuli-4-02 and in minimum
69 out of 101 (68.3 %) children in the control group and
that minimum 80 out of 99 (80.8 %) children in the
CalSuli-4-02 group and a minimum of 73 out of 101
(72.3 %) children in the control group were free of
symptoms. The individual complaint, “appetite disorder”,
was found to be significantly improved in the CalSuli-4-
02 group compared to the control group after 21 days of
treatment, 3 and 6 months post-treatment (Table 4).
Furthermore, significantly more children in the CalSuli-
4-02 group reported absence of “child’s activities impair-
ment” from Baseline to after 21 days treatment and
Termination Visit (Table 5).
Secondary outcome parameter: treatment satisfaction
As shown in Fig. 3, according to IMPSS assessment at
the Termination Visit there were more children/parents
in the CalSuli-4-02 group who were “very satisfied” (58
out of 99 (58.6 %)) with the treatment (χ2-Test: p <
0.0001; ITT) than in the control group (21 out of 101
(20.8 %)). At all other Visits, significant higher treatment
satisfaction ratings for the CalSuli-4-02 group were
found either (results not shown).
Secondary outcome parameter: use of antibiotics
Table 6 shows that at baseline, the majority of children/
parents in both treatment groups reported to use

 antibiotics within 12 months prior to study start either
“sometimes” or “always” (CalSuli-4-02: 52 out of 99
(52.5 %); Control: 53 out of 101 (52.5 %)) when having
an URTI or other ENT diseases. Despite some missing
values, the percentages of children that had “sometimes”
or “always” used antibiotics when they experienced an
URTI or other ENT diseases were strongly decreased
within the 1–3 months post-treatment assessed at 3rd
FU Visit (CalSuli-4-02: 9 out of 99 (9.1 %); Control: 20
out of 101 (19.8 %)) and the 4–6 months post-treatment
assessed at Termination Visit (CalSuli-4-02: 7 out of 99
(7.1 %); Control: 17 out of 101 (16.8 %)). The decreased
use of antibiotics was comparable between both treat-
ment groups at 3rd FU Visit (χ2-Test: p = 0.0934; ITT)
and Termination Visit (χ2-Test: p = 0.1274; ITT).
Secondary outcome parameter: safety assessment
In the CalSuli-4-02 group, 10 out of 99 (10.1 %) children
reported a total of 11 AEs. Four of those AEs in three
children were evaluated as ADRs (dermatitis atopic with
moderate severity and probable causal relationship (2 x),
hyperreflexia with moderate severity and probable causal
relationship, bronchitis with mild severity and unlikely
causal relationship). In the control group, 2 out of 101
(2.0 %) children reported a total of two AEs of which
one was evaluated as an ADR (rhinorrhea with mild se-
verity and unlikely causal relationship). Serious AEs
didn’t occur in both treatment groups. One child in the
CalSuli-4-02 group discontinued treatment and with-
drew from the study due to the experience of two ADRs.
Secondary outcome parameter: tolerability of treatment
Figure 4 shows that at the end of the treatment period (day
21) the tolerability of both homeopathic medicinal products
was rated by the investigator mostly as “excellent” or “good”
with significantly more often “excellent” ratings in the
CalSuli-4-02 group (χ2-Test: p < 0.05; ITT). Comparable re-
sults were obtained for the 1st FU and Termination Visit
(data not shown). Children's/parents' assessment was in ac-
cordance with the investigator’s assessment but no significant
difference between the groups was found on Termination
Visit (χ2-Test: p = 0.0712; ITT).
Discussion
Main finding of the present study was that 3 weeks treat-
ment with CalSuli-4-02 and comparator complex homeo-
pathic product resulted in comparable frequencies of
acute URTIs, within 3 and 6 months post-treatment.

 However, CalSuli-4-02 was significantly more effective
than the comparator in several other outcome parameters.
First of all, CalSuli-4-02 demonstrated overall higher odds
of having fewer complaints at the study end leading to a
better overall health status. Specifically, it was observed
that children’s appetite improved upon treatment with
CalSuli-4-02. It has been reported that 60–72 % (depend-
ing on age) of children with acute URTIs suffer from
appetite disorders or poor appetite, for as long as 17 days
[20]. Since a poor appetite in children is a common paren-
tal worry [21], the improvement in the child’s appetite as
observed with CalSuli-4-02 may thus be of great relevance
for parents. Overall, higher odds of experiencing less
URTI-related symptoms were also observed with CalSuli-
4-02. Absence of child’s activities impairment was signifi-
cantly more reported with CalSuli-4-02, indicating for
example that children were able to be active and play. Not
being able to play is a symptom that is also frequently ob-
served in children with URTIs (up to 60 %), and may last
up to 11 days with each experienced URTI [20]. Any im-
provement in the ability of their child to be active and
play, may, therefore, lower the burden and distress in par-
ents. Furthermore, satisfaction with treatment, as assessed
by children/parents, was higher with CalSuli-4-02 com-
pared to the comparator. High treatment satisfaction of
children and parents with homeopathy are in line with
studies previously published [10, 11, 22]. The mechanisms
by which CalSuli-4-02 may exert its effect were not inves-
tigated in the present study and are currently unknown. A

 general principle in homeopathy is that a homeopathic
medication can stimulate the body’s own adaptive healing
processes. Through this stimulation the organism is en-
able to initiate a systemic self-reorganization toward more
robust functioning as a whole [5]. Further studies are
clearly necessary to investigate how CalSuli-4-02 may
exert its effect on prevention of URTIs by reinforcing the
child’s immune system along with decreasing the suscepti-
bility to catch URTIs.
Both complex homeopathic medical treatments in the
present study appeared to be safe, since a low percentage
(1–3 %) of children reported ADRs which were mild or
moderate in intensity. Similar low percentages of re-
ported ADRs were observed in an outpatient clinical ob-
servational trial in Italy in which the occurrence of
ADRs with homeopathic treatment were rare and not
severe or serious [23] and in a study in which acute
URTIs in children were also treated with a homeopathic
complex product [24]. The tolerability of CalSuli-4-02 as
assessed by investigators and children/parents was sig-
nificantly better rated at the end of treatment period
than the comparator homeopathic product.
The present study has its strengths and its limitations.
A
strength
of
the
study
was
that
children
were
randomized and that allocation of children to treatment
was concealed until study start. Furthermore, a large
number of children was included in the study and the
drop-out rate was very low, increasing the precision of
estimates. A limitation of the present study was that
complaints and symptom severity (except of fever) were
subjectively assessed by investigators or investigators
and children/parents, using non-validated scales, and
only gave information on the children’s health status at
the time of the visit and not of the whole period since
the last visit. Another limitation of this study was that
the use of antipyretics and/or symptomatic medications
(other than antibiotics) for treatment of symptoms of
acute URTIs or ENT diseases were not monitored as
part of the trial documentation. Since these medications
were only allowed to treat acute symptoms of URTIs,
and not for prophylactic reasons, it is unlikely that pos-
sible differences in concomitant mediations between the
two groups had an effect on the primary outcome in the
present study. However, a possible influence of these
medications on secondary outcome parameters com-
plaints and symptoms severity in both groups cannot be
ruled out. Furthermore, the present study was of an
open-label design as both, investigators and children/

 parents, knew which of the two treatments the children
received. It can, therefore, not be excluded that the as-
sessment of the more subjective outcome parameters
such as symptom severity, treatment satisfaction, and
tolerability were subject to expectation bias both for
CalSuli-4-02 and the comparator, which was already reg-
istered for the prevention of acute URTIs. Another limi-
tation of the current study design was that it had not
included a third arm, a control group with children that
received no treatment or a placebo. On average children
experienced a median number of 6.0 acute URTIs in the
12 months period prior to study start (thereof at least
three per child in the last 6 months) and ended with the
occurrence of median 2.0 acute URTIs after 6 months
post-treatment.
Since
the
6
months
post-treatment
period is shorter than the 12 months reference period
before study start and seasonal influence might be con-
sidered, the assessment of the primary objective by
means of Poisson regression modelling was primarily fo-
cused
on
treatment
group
comparison
within
this
shorter period rather than evaluation of changes in the
frequency of occurrences of acute URTIs in terms of a
whole year. However, to test for possible seasonal influ-
ence, the variable was included as a covariate into the stat-
istical model and it was shown that there was no
statistically significant seasonal influence on the outcome
and that the observed reduction in frequency of acute
URTIs was comparable in both treatment groups. In a
case series study by Ramchandani [17], individual homeo-
pathic treatment was shown to prevent the occurrence of
URTIs. In this study children suffered on average of 6.8
URTIs in a period of 6 months prior to treatment start,
which decreased upon homeopathic treatment to 1.8
URTIs at 6 months FU. In two randomized placebo-
controlled trials, the efficacy of single homeopathic medi-
cations was investigated for the prevention of URTIs in
children [25, 26]. In these studies, no significant effect of
homeopathy over placebo was found, possibly explained
by the lack of effect of the homeopathic medications or by
the process of selecting the right homeopathic medica-
tions. Very recently, a three-arm randomized clinical trial
was published in which a complex and a single homeo-
pathic medication were compared to placebo in the pre-
vention of influenza and URTI in children [27]. One year
post-intervention, treatment with both homeopathic med-
ications led to a significant reduction of influenza and
URTIs compared to placebo [27]. This study strengthens
the findings of the present study in which the reduction in
URTIs was also observed in both groups treated with a
homeopathic medication.
An interesting finding of the current study was that

homeopathic
treatments

 antibiotics. Antibiotics are frequently prescribed to treat
URTIs, although it is often inappropriate due to the fre-
quent viral origin of URTIs [3]. High and unnecessary
antibiotic use is one of the main reasons for antibiotic
resistances, which poses nowadays a growing threat to glo-
bal public health [28, 29]. Therefore, there is a world-wide
urgent need to develop and implement strategies that re-
duce inappropriate use of antibiotics [30]. Homeopathic
treatment may be such an alternative treatment strategy to
reduce the use of antibiotics [31]. A cohort study showed
that patients with URTI, who visited a general practitioner
that also practiced homeopathy, had lower consumption of
antibiotics compared to patients visiting a physician who
only practiced regular medicine [32]. Furthermore, in an
open non-randomized observational study children with
otitis media treated with individual homeopathic single
medications used less antibiotics with better or comparable
outcomes than those treated with regular medicine such as
nasal drops, antibiotics, secretolytics and/or antipy-
retics [33]. Both for physicians as well as parents,
homeopathic medications such as CalSuli-4-02 could,
therefore, be an antibiotic sparing measure. In a re-
view
on
complementary
and
alternative
medicine
therapies and antibiotic resistance, it was suggested
that homeopathy could be recommended during the
“watch and wait” period in acute otitis media and the
time between testing and verifying pharyngitis’ poten-
tial bacterial origin, before prescribing antibiotics [34].
Recently, a Dutch consortium was initiated to further
investigate the effectiveness of promising complemen-
tary and alternative medicine therapies as alternative
therapeutic tools
to control infectious
diseases
in
humans [28].
Conclusions
The present study demonstrated a comparable reduction of
URTIs in both treatment groups. However, CalSuli-4-02 led
to significantly less URTI-related complaints and symptoms
and higher treatment satisfaction and tolerability. The ob-
served reduction in antibiotics use upon treatment with the
homeopathic medications under investigation, without the
occurrence of complications, suggests that CalSuli-4-02
may be a promising treatment strategy to tackle antibiotic
resistance. Further research is warranted to investigate the
potential of CalSuli-4-02 as an antibiotic sparing option in
children with recurrent URTIs.
