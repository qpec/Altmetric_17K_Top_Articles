Abstract
Background: Clinical anecdote suggests that rates of eating disorders (ED) vary between
schools. Given their high prevalence and mortality, understanding risk factors is import-
ant. We hypothesised that rates of ED would vary between schools, and that school pro-
portion of female students and proportion of parents with post-high school education
would be associated with ED, after accounting for individual characteristics.
Method: Multilevel analysis of register-based, record-linkage data on 55 059 females
born in Stockholm County, Sweden, from 1983, finishing high school in 2002-10.
Outcome was clinical diagnosis of an ED, or attendance at a specialist ED clinic, aged 16-
20 years.
Results: The 5-year cumulative incidence of ED diagnosis aged 16-20 years was 2.4%.
Accounting for individual risk factors, with each 10% increase in the proportion of girls at
a school, the odds ratio for ED was 1.07 (1.01 to 1.13), P ¼ 0.018. With each 10% increase
in the proportion of children with at least one parent with post-high school education, the
odds ratio for ED was 1.14 (1.09 to 1.19), P < 0.0001. Predicted probability of an average
girl developing an ED was 1.3% at a school with 25% girls where 25% of parents have
post-high school education, and 3.3% at a school with 75% girls where 75% of parents
have post-high school education.
Conclusions: Rates of ED vary between schools; this is not explained by individual char-
acteristics. Girls at schools with high proportions of female students, and students with
highly educated parents, have higher odds of ED regardless of individual risk factors.

 Introduction
Clinical impression suggests that eating disorders (ED) are
more common in some schools than others. We are not
aware of any research on this topic, although rates of dis-
ordered weight control behaviours do vary between
schools.1 ED are particularly common in adolescent girls,2
with a prevalence of 5.7%.3 They have high mortality,
with meta-analysis finding a standardised mortality ratio
(SMR) of 5.9 in anorexia nervosa (AN), over a mean fol-
low-up period of 14.2 years.4 They are difficult to treat: 10
years after diagnosis, up to 50% still have an ED.5
Schools plays a large part in adolescents’ lives and have
been implicated in health problems, including alcohol6-8 and
substance use,6,7 smoking,6,7 obesity,9 depression10 and self-
harm.11 ED research has not addressed this, although as the
proportion of underweight girls in a school increases, so does
the likelihood of any individual female student trying to lose
weight.12 ‘Composition’ (characteristics of individual stu-
dents making up each school) differs between schools.
Therefore, we would expect a school with a higher propor-
tion of parents with higher education, itself a risk factor for
ED,13-15 to have higher rates of ED. Of more interest is
whether there are ‘contextual’ effects of schools that are not
explained by individual student characteristics. If such con-
textual effects exist, possible explanations might be ED being
socially contagious,16 or differences between schools in their
expectations around eating, exercise and achievement. These
might be amenable to preventative intervention.
We hypothesised that incidence of ED in girls would
vary between high schools, after accounting for individual
students’ characteristics. We hypothesised that higher
school proportions of female students, and higher school
proportions of parents with post-high school education,
would be associated with increased rates of ED. We used a
large,
contemporary
population
sample
from
the
Stockholm Youth Cohort,17 Sweden, created by record
linkage from health and administrative registers.
Methods
Study population
The Stockholm Youth Cohort is a register-based study
comprising
all
0-17-year-olds
resident
in
Stockholm
County from 2001 to 2011 (N ¼ 735 096), identified
through the Register of Total Population (provided by
Statistics Sweden). Information on ED and other covariates
was obtained for study participants, and their parents, (as-
certained via the Multi-Generation Register18) through re-
cord linkage to health and administrative registers using
the national registration number assigned to all residents
of Sweden. Information on the ‘Gymnasium’ attended
(school for 15-18-year-olds in Sweden, referred to here as
‘high school’) was obtained through Statistics Sweden. We
began with a core sample born during or after1983, who
left high school in 2002-10 (N ¼ 144 006). The outcome
was first ED diagnosis aged 16-20 years.
Figure

derivation.
We
excluded those attending schools with under 10 students,
as these were likely to be due to data entry errors. School
environment variables, describing socio-demographic char-
acteristics of the schools, were calculated at this stage from
a population of 142 832 subjects. We then excluded boys,
as rates of ED vary strikingly between boys and girls, and
those scoring zero in their school exit examinations, as this
indicated that they did not attend high school for the whole
period studied. We excluded children diagnosed with an
ED before 16 years of age, as they could not have a first
diagnosis of an ED aged 16-20 years. We excluded those
born outside Sweden, as we would not have any data on
them or their parents at the time of their birth. This left 56
725 girls, attending 409 schools, of whom 55 059 had
complete data on all covariates.
Definition of ED cases
Only first (incident) diagnoses made aged 16-20 years were
considered, in order to study the role of school environ-
ment. Young people would have been at their high school
for 1 year prior to a diagnosis. Diagnoses occurring up to 2
years after leaving school were included, to allow for
delayed diagnosis.
Participants were identified as having a diagnosis of an
ED if they were given an ICD code indicating diagnosis of
any ED [any F50 code in ICD-10 (AN, atypical AN, BN,
atypical BN, overeating or vomiting associated with other
psychological disturbances, other ED, ED unspecified);
307.1 (AN)/307.5 (BN, ED not otherwise specified) in
Key Messages
• Eating disorders are more common in some high schools than others.
• Variation in rates of eating disorders between high schools is not explained by any individual student characteristics
that the current study was able to assess.
• On average a young woman, regardless of her own background, is more likely to develop an ED if she attends a
school with a higher proportion of girls or a higher proportion of children of highly educated parents.

 ICD-9], or the equivalent DSM-IV codes, by a specialist
clinician as an inpatient or outpatient during follow-up.
Cases were also identified through attendance at a specialist
ED clinics, as we judged it very likely that these individuals
had an ED. Previous work in this cohort has shown that
findings are unchanged in sensitivity analyses where out-
come is restricted to a recorded diagnosis of ED or attending
a specialist ED clinic at least three times.13 Sources for iden-
tifying ED cases were: (i) Clinical Database for Child and
Adolescent Psychiatry in Stockholm (DSM-IV diagnoses
from child and adolescent psychiatric services, 2001 on-
wards); (ii) Stockholm County Council Health Service Use
Register

diagnoses for all psychiatric inpatients, 1973 onwards).
Other variables
Record linkage enabled us to obtain data on maternal age
at childbirth, parental level of education and disposable in-
come, country of birth, examination scores, family type at
birth of child (single- or two-parent family) and number of
siblings at birth of child. Parental mental health variables

 were obtained from any psychiatric diagnosis from sources
ii, iii and iv described for ED diagnoses above, and also pri-
mary care records. Gestational age and birthweight were
ascertained from the Medical Birth Register.19 School en-
vironment variables were generated from data on 142 832
male and female subjects, by calculating the proportion of
the students at each school in the sample who were female,
who had at least one parent with post-high school educa-
tion and so on (see Table 1). The Stockholm Regional
Ethical Review Board approved the study.
Analysis
We described the whole sample and compared it with
the sample with complete data on covariates (‘complete
case sample’) (Table 1). To examine clustering of ED
diagnoses in pupils from the same schools, we used
mixed effects logistic regression models20 to estimate
odds ratios (ORs) for ED in relation to individual- and
school-level variables, using the command ‘xtmelogit’ in
Stata 13, treating students as elementary units and
schools as clustering units. These models also allowed
calculation of the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)
corresponding to each fitted model. When the model is
fitted without explanatory variables, the ICC represents
the percentage of total variation in (log) odds of ED
that is due to differences between schools (‘between-
school heterogeneity’). Some of these differences can be
explained by individual student-level variables, such par-
ental education. We therefore also calculated ICCs for
models including individual student variables, first separ-
ately and then jointly (choosing those which separately
had the greatest effect on the ICC). When school-level
variables are included in the model, the ICC represents
the percentage of residual variation that is due to be-
tween-school heterogeneity (Table 2).

 Adding school environment variables (such as percent-
age of girls attending the school) to the models allowed us
to estimate ORs for ED for different school environment
factors and to calculate relative contributions of these vari-
ables to between-school variation. The sequence of models
first examines the effect of adding one school environment
variable at a time (with and without controlling for indi-
vidual student-level variables), and then of each variable
together with the proportion of students at the school with
at least one parent with post-high school education
(Figure 2).
We also investigated whether there was an interaction
between the proportion of children at a school with at least
one parent with post-high school education, and the high-
est parental educational level of each individual student.
We created an interaction term for this combination in
order to test the hypothesis that individuals were at higher
risk of ED if they were different from their peers (i.e. a stu-
dent with parents with a lower level of education in a
school with a high proportion of highly educated parents,
and vice versa).
One explanation for differences in proportions of stu-
dents identified with an ED in different schools is that par-
ents with post-high school education may be more aware
of available services. To test this explanation, we used the
complete model described above to investigate whether
being seen in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services
(CAMHS) for any mental health problem was associated
with the proportion of students who have one or both par-
ents with post-high school education.
A final model including school proportion of children
with at least one parent with post-high school education,
school proportion of girls, and all individual-level vari-
ables, was used to predict the probability of ED for an
average girl in different school settings (Table 3).
All analyses were conducted using Stata 13.
Results
Descriptive data
The sample came from 409 schools. Individuals in the
complete case sample had slightly fewer parents born
abroad and slightly higher disposable income than the
whole sample. School environment variables were very
similar for whole and complete case samples. 2.4% of the
55 059 girls in the complete case sample were diagnosed
with an ED aged 16-20 years. Of these, 22% had a diagno-
sis of AN, 14% a diagnosis of BN, and the remainder had
an ED inferred from attendance at a specialist ED clinic;
94% of the cohort remained in Stockholm county the year
after leaving high school.

 School environment and rates of ED
Of the total variation in odds of ED, 4.4% [95% confi-
dence interval (CI) 2.8 to 7.1] was due to differences be-
tween schools. The individual student characteristics with
the greatest impact on this variation were parental level of
education, parental psychiatric history, maternal age, dis-
posable income and having a parent born outside Sweden.
When all these individual characteristics were included in
the model, the variation in the odds of ED due to variation
between schools reduced to 2.9% (95% CI 1.6 to 5.3).
We examined associations between school characteris-
tics and odds of ED. After adjusting for individual risk fac-
tors, with each 10% increase in the proportion of girls at a
school, the odds ratio for ED was 1.07 (1.01 to 1.13), P ¼
0.018. With each 10% increase in the proportion of chil-
dren with at least one parent with post-high school educa-
tion, the odds ratio for ED was 1.14 (1.09 to 1.19), P <
0.0001. Attending a school with a greater proportion of
students achieving examination results in the top 20% of
the population, or with disposable income levels in the top
20% of the population, was also associated with increased
odds of being diagnosed with an ED. Attending a school
with a higher proportion of students born outside Sweden
was associated with decreased odds of developing an ED.
Adjustment for school proportion of parents with post-
high school education substantially reduced the ORs of all
school-level variables except percentage of females [OR
1.06 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.11%), P ¼ 0.026; Figure 2].
After adjusting for each of the other school characteris-
tics in turn, a 10% increase in the proportion of parents
with post-high school education remained associated with
an increase in the odds of ED [e.g. 1.14 (1.09 to 1.18), P <
0.0001 after adjusting for proportion of girls].
We found no evidence of an association between school
proportion of parents with post-high school education and
referral to CAMHS for any mental health problem [OR
1.00 (95% CI 0.98, 1.05), P ¼ 0.739]; nor was there evi-
dence of other school-level variables being associated with

between individual- and school-level parental education
(P ¼ 0.44).
Table 3 shows predicted probabilities of an average girl
developing an ED in different school environments, based
on the final additive model holding all individual-level
variables at the mean or modal values. The predicted prob-
ability of developing an ED is: 1.3% for pupils in a school
with 25% girls, where 25% of the children have at least
one parent with post-high school education; and 3.3% in a
school with 75% girls where 75% of children have at least
one parent with post-high school education.
Discussion
Main Findings
Diagnosed ED are more common in girls at some schools
than others, and this is not explained by the individual
characteristics of the students. Aspects of school environ-
ment are associated with ED. On average a young woman,
regardless of her own background, is more likely to
develop an ED if she attends a school with a higher propor-
tion of girls or of children of highly educated parents.
Strengths and limitations
As far as we are aware, this is the first study to investigate
whether rates of diagnosed ED among girls vary between
schools. Methodological strengths include its total popula-
tion design, large sample size and prospective information
on potentially confounding variables. Register-based stud-
ies13-15,21,22 contribute to our understanding of ED aeti-
ology by enabling us to study very large numbers of people
with diagnosed ED. Limitations of the present study include
the lack of information on all individual characteristics
which may predispose to ED. Second, not all individuals
with ED seek treatment, and those that do may be seen in
primary care or in private services, for whom we do not
have data, so we are likely to have underestimated rates. In
the USA, only 3-28% of adolescents with an ED report
receiving specific treatment for weight or eating problems23;
numbers may be higher in Sweden, where there is a compre-
hensive, government-provided health service, but barriers to
treatment such as stigma, denial, and lack of public aware-
ness may still play a role. Rates of diagnosed ED may vary
between schools if those with greater numbers of educated
parents are better at identifying ED and directing students
towards help. We found no evidence of an association be-
tween higher proportions of educated parents and being
seen within Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services,
but barriers to treatment-seeking may be different for eating
disorders than for other psychiatric disorders.
We did not study AN, BN or eating disorder not other-
wise specified in separate analyses because of limited statis-
tical
power,
partly
because
some
sources
do
not
differentiate
between
subtypes.
Results
cannot
be
generalized to immigrant populations, as those born
abroad were excluded due to a lack of data.
Comparison with previous findings
Variation in rates of ED due to differences between schools
was similar to the variation of disordered weight control
behaviours between schools in a US sample,1 although we
found that differences between schools persisted after ad-
justing for individual variables. Differences may be due to
our study being much larger, the nature of our (treatment-
seeking) sample, or differences between disordered weight
control behaviours and diagnosed ED.
Possible mechanisms
The primary purpose of our analysis was to demonstrate
an association between school environment factors and
eating disorders, but future research may consider whether
the associations we have observed may be causal, rather
than explained by unmeasured confounding or other sour-
ces of bias. Possible ways in which school environment
might in that case contribute to the development of ED in-
clude those around the idea of ED being contagious, and
those relating to differences in school environments, for ex-
ample in schools’ expectations around achievement.
Schools with more girls, or more highly educated par-
ents, are likely to have some students with ED because fe-
male gender and parental education are risk factors for ED.
However, differences between schools may be inflated if ED
are contagious and can spread within schools. There are
various mechanisms whereby ED may be contagious. Social
comparison theory16 suggests that comparing one’s own
body negatively with those of others leads to body dissatis-
faction (a known risk factor for ED).24 Body size perceived
as most normal and attractive is altered through exposure to
women of different sizes, both in the laboratory25,26 and in
real life.27 Rates of body dissatisfaction are higher in areas
with lower mean population body mass index (BMI), and
vice versa.28 In a school with a lower mean BMI (perhaps
due to some students having ED), students might perceive
themselves as larger, leading to higher levels of body dissat-
isfaction and more ED. The finding that in schools with
greater proportions of underweight girls, individual girls are
more likely to try to lose weight,12 supports this idea.
Students may also ‘learn’ eating disordered behaviours
from witnessing others. Research suggests that body
image concern,29 extreme weight loss behaviours29,30 and
bingeing31 are influenced by friendship group.

 All schools have unique environments. They may vary
in food provided, whether students bring a packed lunch
or can easily leave at lunchtimes, whether students are ex-
pected to take part in extra-curricular activities during
their lunch break, and presence and contents of vending
machines. These variations are associated with differences
in behaviour: number of snacks purchased from vending
machines increases with number of vending machines in a
school,32 and pupils consume more fruit and vegetables in
schools with salad bars.33 More subtly, schools have dis-
tinctive cultures which may influence student beliefs, atti-
tudes
and
behaviour
regarding
eating,
exercise
and
appearance. Schools with more students from more edu-
cated families may have higher aspirations and exert
greater demands on their students. This may encourage
perfectionism, which is strongly associated with ED,34 as
girls strive to attain the goal of the ‘thin ideal’.35 Thus an
aspirational school culture may inadvertently lead to
increased rates of ED. Compared with their co-educated
peers, girls in single-sex schools view achievement as more
important, and are more likely to associate intelligence and
professional success with being thinner.36
Another possible explanation is that differences be-
tween schools could be due to differences in treatment-
seeking, rather than differences in rates of ED per se.
Implications
Swedish gender equality laws mean all schools must admit
both sexes, although occasionally student choice may lead
to some schools being single-sex. Nevertheless, we believe
that these results are likely to generalize to other countries.
We do not know whether the proportion of girls and pro-
portion of highly educated parents in a school cause an in-
crease in the number of diagnosed eating disorders, but
these results suggest that female students at fee-paying or
selective schools are more likely to have a diagnosed ED,
particularly if the schools are single-sex. If future research
finds school environment to be causal in the development
of ED, preventative interventions aimed at schools them-
selves, for example, training teachers, may be valuable in
schools with high rates of ED. If differences are in fact due
to differences in rates of treatment-seeking, schools with
lower rates may need support in raising awareness or
reducing stigmatization of eating disorders.

It is only recently that epidemiologists have ventured into
communities to understand the distribution and determi-
nants of eating disorders in adolescents. A decade ago, nearly
all evidence of eating disorder risk factors came from clinical
samples. Now, a number of population-based studies have
provided insights on who is at highest risk and what might
