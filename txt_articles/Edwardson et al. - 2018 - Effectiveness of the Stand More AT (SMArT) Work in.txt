ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVES
To evaluate the impact of a multicomponent 
intervention (Stand More AT (SMArT) Work) designed 
to reduce sitting time on short (three months), 
medium (six months), and longer term (12 months) 
changes in occupational, daily, and prolonged 
sitting, standing, and physical activity, and physical, 
psychological, and work related health.
DESIGN
Cluster two arm randomised controlled trial.
SETTING
National Health Service trust, England.
PARTICIPANTS
37 office clusters (146 participants) of desk 
based workers: 19 clusters (77 participants) 
were randomised to the intervention and 18 
(69 participants) to control.
INTERVENTIONS
The intervention group received a height adjustable 
workstation, a brief seminar with supporting leaflet, 
workstation instructions with sitting and standing 
targets, feedback on sitting and physical activity at 
three time points, posters, action planning and goal 
setting booklet, self monitoring and prompt tool, and 
coaching sessions (month 1 and every three months 
thereafter). The control group continued with usual 
practice.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
The primary outcome was occupational sitting time 
(thigh worn accelerometer). Secondary outcomes 
were objectively measured daily sitting, prolonged 
sitting (≥30 minutes), and standing time, physical 
activity, musculoskeletal problems, self reported work 
related health (job performance, job satisfaction, 
work engagement, occupational fatigue, sickness 
presenteeism, and sickness absenteeism), cognitive 
function, and self reported psychological measures 
(mood and affective states, quality of life) assessed 
at 3, 6, and 12 months. Data were analysed using 
generalised estimating equation models, accounting 
for clustering.
RESULTS
A significant difference between groups (in favour of 
the intervention group) was found in occupational 
sitting time at 12 months (−83.28 min/workday, 
95% confidence interval −116.57 to −49.98, 
P=0.001). Differences between groups (in favour 
of the intervention group compared with control) 
were observed for occupational sitting time at three 
months (−50.62 min/workday, −78.71 to −22.54, 
P<0.001) and six months (−64.40 min/workday, 
−97.31 to −31.50, P<0.001) and daily sitting time 
at six months (−59.32 min/day, −88.40 to −30.25, 
P<0.001) and 12 months (−82.39 min/day, −114.54 
to −50.26, P=0.001). Group differences (in favour 
of the intervention group compared with control) 
were found for prolonged sitting time, standing time, 
job performance, work engagement, occupational 
fatigue, sickness presenteeism, daily anxiety, and 
quality of life. No differences were seen for sickness 
absenteeism.
CONCLUSIONS
SMArT Work successfully reduced sitting time over the 
short, medium, and longer term, and positive changes 
were observed in work related and psychological 
health.

Introduction
A 
wealth 
of 
epidemiological 
evidence 
shows 
that sedentary behaviour is associated with an 
increased risk of chronic disease (type 2 diabetes, 
cardiovascular disease, some cancers) and mortality, 
often independently of body mass index (BMI) and 
physical activity,1-4 poor mental health,5 6 and a 
lower quality of life.7 Office workers are one of the 
most sedentary populations, spending 70-85% of 
time at work sitting.8 9 It has also been reported 
that over a third of their total sitting time at work 
is accumulated in bouts of prolonged sitting (>30 
minutes).8 
Occupational 
sedentary 
behaviour 
specifically has been associated with an increased 
risk of diabetes and mortality10 and musculoskeletal 
problems such as neck and shoulder pain,11 as well 
WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
High levels of sedentary behaviour (sitting) have been associated with an 
increased risk of morbidity and mortality and have been shown to be detrimental 
for work related outcomes such as engagement and presenteeism
Office workers are one of the most sedentary populations, spending 70-85% of 
time at work sitting
Interventions to reduce sitting in the workplace have received increasing 
attention in recent years but studies to evaluate these have been deemed 
low quality
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
The SMArT Work multicomponent intervention involving a height adjustable 
workstation, successfully reduced occupational sitting time over the short, 
medium, and longer term in a sample of office workers
Positive changes were observed in work related and psychological health

as being detrimental for important work related 
outcomes such as engagement12and presenteeism.13 
Research on outcomes such as work engagement 
and presenteeism is, however, limited. These links 
between sedentary behaviour and health and work 
related outcomes are important because the estimated 
costs of presenteeism and absenteeism in the United 
Kingdom are reported to be more than £30bn ($39bn; 
€34bn), with presenteeism costing over twice as 
much as absenteeism.14 More positively, reductions in 
sitting and breaking up sitting through standing and 
walking in acute experimental settings have led to 
improvements in important cardiometabolic markers 
of health such as glucose and insulin levels and blood 
pressure,15-22 and feelings of fatigue and vigour.23 24
In response to this evidence, interventions to reduce 
sitting time in the workplace have received increasing 
attention in recent years.25 These have focused on 
numerous strategies, including physical changes to the 
workplace, such as providing height adjustable desks 
to enable sitting or standing, pedalling workstations, 
treadmill desks, policy changes, information provision, 
counselling, and computer prompts.25 While positive 
findings were observed for some strategies in terms 
of reducing sitting time, particularly the provision 
of height adjustable desks, the quality of evidence 
was considered low for most studies owing to non-
powered small studies and studies with a high risk 
of bias.25 Furthermore, interventions have typically 
been evaluated over the short term, so knowledge on 
longer term effectiveness is lacking. Although some 
studies have examined the impact of sitting reduction 
interventions on work related outcomes such as job 
performance and productivity,25 26 presenteeism,26 
and absenteeism,26 27 it is difficult to draw conclusions 
across these studies owing to the limitations in study 
designs.
The Stand Up Victoria study was one recent 
example that addressed these limitations. This was 
a multicomponent intervention in Australia, and 
effectiveness was tested within a cluster randomised 
controlled trial over 12 months.28 Components 
comprised a group based workshop, feedback on 
sitting behaviour, provision of a height adjustable 
desk attachment, goal setting, and ongoing support 
for three months in the form of emails or individual 
coaching sessions. The intervention was successful 
in reducing daily sitting and sitting at work29 and 
led to small improvements in glucose levels and 
cardiometabolic risk.30 However, high quality designs 
remain scarce and studies in the UK are lacking. The 
Stand More At Work (SMArT Work) intervention was 
designed in response to this need and was developed 
using guidance from the Behaviour Change Wheel31 (a 
framework for designing interventions) after formative 
research with office workers.32
We undertook a cluster randomised controlled trial 
to test the impact of the SMArT Work intervention over 
the short (three months), medium (six months), and 
longer term (12 months) in a sample of office workers 
working within the English National Health Service, 
the largest employer in the UK. The primary objective 
was to test whether the SMArT Work intervention led 
to changes in occupational sitting time at 12 months 
compared with control.
Methods
Study design
The study is reported according to the CONSORT 
statement for cluster randomised controlled trials. This 
study was a cluster randomised controlled trial with 
follow-up measures at 3, 6, and 12 months. The full 
trial protocol has been published.33 Randomisation 
occurred at the office group level to reduce the risk 
of contamination. Using computer generated lists, 
a statistician randomised office groups (clusters) 
1:1 to either intervention or control group stratified 
by cluster size (≤4 and >4 participants) with a block 
size of six. Randomisation was performed in batches 
after participant clusters had completed their baseline 
measures. Team members who took measurements 
were blinded to group randomisation. The team leads 
could not be blinded as they were responsible for 
study coordination, including delivery of the desks 
and intervention components. Team leads had no 
involvement in data processing and analysis.
Recruitment took place between October 2015 and 
June 2016, with baseline data collection between 
November 2015 and June 2016 and follow-up data 
collection between March 2016 and June 2017. The 
study was coordinated from the Leicester Diabetes

Centre, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, 
and all data were collected on site at the University 
Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust.
Setting and participants
The participants were recruited from the University 
Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust. This trust consists 
of three hospitals across Leicester—Leicester Royal 
Infirmary, Leicester General Hospital, and Glenfield 
Hospital. All participants provided informed consent 
on entering into the study.
During the grant application process, managers 
across the trust were approached to gauge interest in 
their team taking part in the study (this information 
was used to generate the original sample size 
calculation). Once the study had started, these 
managers were approached again as well as the staff
 
within their team. Alongside this, we carried out other 
methods of recruitment. The study was included in the 
chief executive’s monthly e-newsletter as well as being 
advertised on the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS 
Trust staff intranet, and by posters displayed in staff
 
rooms across the hospital sites. To promote the study 
to staff members and answer any questions they might 
have, we set up advertisement stands, manned by a 
member of the research team, in the canteens on each 
hospital site over lunch times. Any interested teams 
and individual staff members contacted the study team 
to obtain a participant information sheet outlining 
the study requirements and a reply slip used to assess 
eligibility. Staff members who responded were asked to 
encourage their colleagues to join the study.
We contacted eligible participants to organise a 
convenient date to consent them into the study and 
take their baseline measurements. Measurements were 
carried out in a private room at the participants’ place 
of work. Staff aged 18-70 years were eligible if they 
were office based (self reported and confirmed at a visit 
by a researcher), spent most (≥75% (self reported), 
excluding mandatory breaks) of their workday sitting 
(self reported), worked at least 0.6 full time equivalent, 
worked at the same desk for at least three days a week, 
and were capable of standing.
Participant personal and anthropometric measures
Information on age, sex, ethnicity, smoking status, 
current job role, pay grade, and working hours were 
collected by questionnaire. Body weight and body fat 
(Tanita SC-330ST, Tanita, West Drayton, UK), height 
(Leicester Height Measure, Seca, Birmingham, UK), 
and waist circumference (midpoint between the lower 
costal margin and iliac crest) were measured to the 
nearest 0.1 kg, 0.1%, 0.5, and 0.5 cm, respectively. 
Arterial blood pressure was measured in the sitting 
position (Omron Healthcare, Henfield, UK); three 
measurements were obtained and the average of the 
last two used.
Outcome measures
Primary and secondary outcomes were assessed at 
baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months.
Primary outcome
The primary outcome was change in occupational 
sitting time measured by the activPAL micro (PAL 
Technologies, Glasgow, UK). The activPAL is a small 
accelerometer worn on the thigh, which determines 
body posture—that is, sitting/lying, and upright (with 
and without stepping). This device is increasingly used 
in sedentary behaviour research34 and has been shown 
to be highly accurate in measuring sitting, standing, and 
stepping and in detecting reductions in sitting.35-37 We 
asked participants to wear the device continuously for 
seven consecutive days on the midline anterior aspect 
of the right thigh. The device was initialised using 
the manufacturer’s software (activPAL3 Professional 
Research Edition; PAL Technologies, Glasgow) with 
default settings. The device was waterproofed with a 
nitrile sleeve and Hypafix Transparent (BSN medical, 
Hull, UK) dressing and secured to the thigh with a 
piece of Hypafix Transparent dressing. We asked 
participants to complete a log of sleep and wake times 
while wearing the device, removal times of the device, 
and the start and end times of each workday.
Devices were collected in person, and a validated 
algorithm in STATA (StataCorp) was used to download 
and process data. This has been described elsewhere,38 
but in brief the algorithm uses the activPAL eventsXYZ.
csv files to isolate waking hours from sleeping (time in 
bed), prolonged periods of non-wear, and invalid data. 
The processed data were checked visually (by creating 
heatmaps of the data, as described elsewhere34) for 
any occasions where the algorithm incorrectly coded 
sleep and waking behaviour (eg, where wake and sleep 
times were different from other days of data—ie, looked 
very early or very late compared with other days), and 
on such occasions we referred to the self reported log 
and, if necessary, corrected the data. This algorithm has 
previously shown a high level of agreement with diary 
reported wear times during waking hours(κ>0.8 for 88% 
of participants; median κ=0.94).34 To isolate data for work 
hours, we matched the self reported work times collected 
in the log with those of the device data (in the processed 
eventsXYZ file). We included events (ie, bouts of sitting, 
standing, stepping) that crossed the self reported start 
and end of work times within the work hours data if 50% 
or more of the event was within the period of interest.34 
Workplace data were considered valid if the device was 
worn for 80% or more of self reported work hours39 and 
participants provided at least one valid workday.29 To 
minimise the possibility of reactivity, we discarded the 
first day of data collected from analysis.
Secondary outcomes
Physical activity and other sedentary behaviour 
variables—Other variables of interest calculated from 
the activPAL data included daily sitting time along 
with prolonged sitting time (≥30 minutes), standing 
time, stepping time (light and moderate to vigorous) 
with outcomes calculated during work hours and 
daily (ie, across all waking hours). For the daily data 
we defined a valid day as a day with less than 95% 
spent in any one behaviour (eg, standing or sitting),

more than 500 steps, and 10 hours or more of data 
from waking hours. To be included in the analysis of 
daily data we required participants to have at least one 
valid day.
Alongside the activPAL, participants also wore the 
ActiGraph Link accelerometer (ActiGraph, Pensacola, 
FL) on their non-dominant wrist continuously for 
seven days to capture time spent in moderate to 
vigorous physical activity during work and daily 
levels. ActiGraph files were processed with R-package 
GGIR version 1.5-10 (http://cran.r-project.org).40 41 
We excluded files from all analyses if post-calibration 
error was greater than 0.02 g (gravity)42 or fewer than 
10 hours of wear time was recorded during the 24 
hour day of interest. Detection of non-wear has been 
described in detail previously (see ‘‘Procedure for 
Nonwear Detection’’ in the paper’s supplementary 
document).40 Briefly, non-wear is estimated based on 
the standard deviation and value range of each axis, 
calculated for 60 minute windows with 15 minute 
moving increments. If for at least two of the three axes 
the standard deviation is less than 13 mg (milligravity) 
or the value range is less than 50 mg we classified the 
time window as non-wear.
We used the threshold of 100 mg or more to calculate 
the time accumulated in moderate to vigorous physical 
activity at work and daily.43
Musculoskeletal health—the Standardised Nordic 
Questionnaire was used to assess musculoskeletal 
problems in nine body areas (neck, shoulder, upper 
back, elbow, wrist, lower back, hip, knee, and ankle) 
over the past week and year.44
Work related measures—A questionnaire captured 
several measures. Work engagement was assessed 
using a nine item questionnaire with a 7-point Likert 
scale45; work engagement is defined by high levels of 
personal energy where a worker wants to put the time 
and effort into their work (vigour and vitality) and sees 
their work as significant (dedication) and interesting 
(absorption).45 Work engagement is an important 
indicator 
of 
both 
productivity 
and 
workforce 
wellbeing.46 Job satisfaction47 and performance48 were 
measured using single item questions on a 7-point 
Likert scale. Occupational fatigue was assessed using 
the Need for Recovery Scale, an 11 item questionnaire 
with yes or no options for each question.49 The need 
for recovery refers to the extent that the work task 
induces a need to recuperate from work induced effort. 
The severity and duration of symptoms are assessed, 
which indicate that the respondent is not fully 
recovered from the effects of sustained effort during the 
working day and has reduced motivation for activities 
in the evening with family or friends.50 Fatigue at work 
has been associated with stress and burnout, which in 
turn can lead to reductions in productivity and higher 
absence due to sickness.50 Sickness presenteeism, 
often defined as going to work despite illness, was 
assessed using two questionnaires: the eight item Work 
Limitations Questionnaire51 measured the degree to 
which health problems interfered with specific aspects 
of job performance and the productivity impact 
of these work limitations (presenteeism). It asks 
employees to rate their level of difficulty (or ability) 
to perform in eight areas of work in the past two 
weeks. For example, to concentrate on work, speak 
with people, handle the workload, and finish on time. 
Responses are combined into four work limitation 
scales: time management, physical demands, mental 
and interpersonal, and output demands. The Work 
Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire 
(WPAI-GH 2.0)52 measured absenteeism (percentage 
of work time missed due to health problems in the past 
seven days), presenteeism (percentage of impairment 
experienced while at work in the past seven days due 
to health problems), overall impairment (combination 
of absenteeism and presenteeism), and activity 
impairment (percentage of impairment in daily 
activities as a result of health problems in the past 
seven days). This latter questionnaire was only used 
for cost effectiveness analysis and will not be reported 
in this article. Data on sickness absence from work 
was obtained by self report (previous three month) 
and by organisational records for 12 months before 
the start of the study and for the 12 months’ duration 
of the study.
Cognitive 
function—Cognitive 
function 
was 
assessed using computerised and paper based tasks. 
A touch screen laptop was used for the Digit Symbol 
Substitution Test,53 which assesses processing speed, 
attention, and concentration, and the Stroop Colour-
Word Test, which assesses executive function.54 Paper 
based tasks included the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test 
to assess memory recall55 and verbal fluency.56
Mood and affective states—Mood and affective 
states were assessed using the Mood Affect Adjective 
Check List-Revised. This check list measures anxiety, 
depression, hostility, and positive and sensation 
seeking affects.57 It measures affect both as a temporary 
state (today) and, more generally, as a disposition 
(generally).
Quality of life—The World Health Organization 
Quality of Life-BREF was used to measure quality of 
life. This questionnaire incudes four domains: physical 
health, psychological health, social relationships, and 
environment.58
Intervention group
The intervention group received the SMArT Work 
intervention for the length of the randomised 
controlled trial (12 months). SMArT Work is grounded 
in several behaviour change theories (social cognitive 
theory,59 
organisational 
development 
theory,60 
habit theory,61 self regulation theory,62 and relapse 
prevention theory63), and it is implemented through 
the Behaviour Change Wheel and the associated 
capability, opportunity, motivation, and behaviour 
(COM-B) approach.31 The intervention design and 
behaviour change strategies take into account the 
organisational environment and social norms, 
individual, and interpersonal factors that influence 
sitting behaviour at work. Supplementary table

supplementary figure 1A includes the logic model of 
the intervention.
Organisational strategies—We sought management 
buy-in by meeting with the chief executive of the 
hospital trust. He showed his support for the study 
and the intervention through his regular e-newsletter 
sent to all staff, and through members of the Clinical 
Management Groups who were also asked to show 
support (ie, encourage involvement and allow time for 
intervention activities) and to filter this message down 
to the other management team leads.
Environmental strategies—After attendance at a 
seminar (see individual and group strategies for 
more information), participants were provided with 
a height adjustable desk or desk platform to enable 
them to sit or stand to work. They were given a choice 
between a full sized electric desk (twin leg single step 
stand desk 1200×800, MACOI, Kimbolton, UK), which 
allows the desk top to move up and down, or a choice 
of two sizes of desk platform (Pro Plus 30 or Pro Plus 
48, VARIDESK; TX), which sits on the existing desk 
allowing the computer screen and keyboard to be 
moved up and down. This choice allowed flexibility for 
office set-up and to avoid testing the effectiveness of a 
specific type of desk rather than the height adjustable 
desk concept. We provided a brief training session on 
how to use the desk or platform and on the ergonomic 
set-up. A leaflet was also provided to reinforce these 
messages.
Individual and group strategies—An initial group 
based education seminar (around 30 minutes’ 
duration) was delivered, which covered the health 
consequences of sitting and the benefits of reducing 
and regularly breaking up sitting. These messages 
were also reinforced in a leaflet provided at the end 
of the seminar. Participants were given their baseline 
results from the activPAL device at the end of the 
seminar, which informed them of their sitting (total and 
prolonged), standing, and stepping time at work, and 
overall daily levels. They were then provided with an 
action plan and goal setting booklet and encouraged 
to set a goal around sitting less at work based on their 
activPAL feedback and to create an action plan for 
this to be achieved. We provided participants with a 
DARMA cushion (Darma, CA, USA). to enable them to 
more regularly track and self monitor their sitting time 
(total and prolonged) and be prompted (in the form of 
a vibration) to regularly break up sitting. This cushion, 
which can be placed on an office chair, is approximately 
2.5 cm thick and uses Bluetooth to sync data with a 
mobile phone app to provide the participant with real-
time feedback. The frequency of the vibration prompt is 
a user defined setting (eg, can be set up to vibrate every 
30 or 45 minutes). Every few months the participants 
received posters, with either educational or motivational 
messages. To provide ongoing support to participants, 
a trained member of the research team offered brief 
(about 15 minutes) coaching sessions, either face-to-
face or by telephone, at month 1 and every three months 
thereafter to discuss progress, review goals and action 
plans, and discuss personal or social and group barriers 
and any benefits experienced. After each visit for follow-
up measurements, the participants were provided with 
their results from the activPAL device, and these were 
compared with the baseline data. This allowed the 
participants to review their progress and goals.
Control group
Participants in control office clusters were not given 
any lifestyle advice, guidance, or results from the 
activPAL device. However, they received the results 
of health measures (eg, weight, blood pressure) taken 
at each time point (the intervention participants also 
received their own results). Other than this, these 
participants continued with usual practice for the 12 
month study period.
Statistical analysis
Sample size
After starting recruitment procedures, we amended 
our sample size calculation because of differences in 
office cluster sizes from our original plan. The study 
funder and sponsor agreed this amendment. The office 
cluster sizes were different because during the grant 
application process we approached managers within 
the hospital trust for their interest, and the original 
sample size was based on the department sizes of the 
managers who had expressed an interest in taking 
part. On commencement of the trial and advertising of 
the study, which was over two years after this initial 
contact, not all managers and staff within these initially 
identified potential clusters volunteered, but staff who 
were within other departments not originally identified 
did volunteer. These resulted in different clusters sizes. 
The published protocol33 outlines the original sample 
size of 238 participants from 14 clusters. The average 
cluster size was smaller than originally planned. After 
completion of recruitment, 37 office clusters were 
recruited, with an average office cluster size of 4 (range 
1-16) office workers. This final sample size resulted in 
more than 90% power to detect a reduction of 60 min/
workday (SD 60 min/workday64) in occupational sitting 
time between the groups, with a 25% drop-out and non-
compliance to primary outcome taken into account. A 60 
min/workday difference was chosen after consideration 
of the published literature at the time of designing the 
study.1 64 65
As with the initial sample size calculation this 
assumes an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.05 
and coefficient of variation for cluster size of 0.9. The 
sample size was robust to changes in the intraclass 
correlation coefficient—a value of 0.1 would still give 
over 90% power.
Data analysis
A statistical analysis plan was written, finalised, 
and agreed before data were available. We compared 
cluster and participant level characteristics by group 
allocation, using either means (standard deviations) 
or medians (interquartile ranges) for continuous

The primary outcome, occupational sitting time 
(average min/workday) at 12 months, was analysed on 
a complete case basis using a generalised estimating 
equation model with an exchangeable correlation 
structure, accounting for clustering. The primary 
analysis was based on participants providing data 
for at least one valid workday from the activPAL 
device. The model included a binary indicator for 
randomisation group and was adjusted for baseline 
sitting time, cluster size (≤4 or >4 participants), and 
average activPAL wear time during work hours across 
baseline and 12 months.
We carried out several sensitivity analyses of the 
primary outcome and daily sitting time: intention 
to treat analysis with missing data imputed using 
multiple 
imputation,66 
impact 
of 
variation 
in 
occupational or waking wear time, time spent in each 
activity, normalised to an eight hour workday and a 16 
hour waking day as used in a previous similar study,29 
and the effect of the number of valid activPAL working 
and overall days chosen for the primary analysis and 
how changing this affected the results. We assessed 
two scenarios: two working and overall days or more 
and three working and overall days or more.
To assess if the intervention effect was statistically 
different between groups we conducted several 
subgroup analyses: hospital site (Leicester General 
Hospital, Leicester Royal Infirmary, Glenfield General 
Hospital), worker status (part time, full time), sex 
(men, women), age (below or above the median), and 
body mass index (normal, overweight or obese (≥25  
kg/
m2). We included interaction terms in the generalised 
estimating equation models to assess differences 
between subgroups.
Secondary outcomes were also analysed using 
generalised estimating equation models with an 
exchangeable correlation structure (an independent 
structure was used where models did not converge). 
For binary outcomes we used a logit link with a 
binomial distribution for the outcome, and for 
continuous outcomes we used an identity link with 
a normal distribution. All primary and secondary 
analyses for the accelerometer (activPAL and 
ActiGraph) outcomes were adjusted for baseline 
value, office size, and average activPAL wear time 
during work hours (for occupational activPAL 
outcomes) and average activPAL waking wear hours 
(for daily activPAL outcomes) across baseline and 
outcome time. We repeated the analysis at each time 
point (3, 6, and 12 months). Adjustment for multiple 
testing of secondary outcomes was not performed. We 
interpreted outcomes according to the overall pattern 
of results; individual results should therefore be 
interpreted with caution. Statistical significance was 
set at 5%. All analyses were conducted using Stata 
version 14.
Patient and public involvement
The public were involved in this study in several 
ways. Office workers within the target organisation 
contributed to the intervention strategies and content 
before they were developed. Lay members from within 
and outside the target organisation (NHS trust) sat on 
the trial steering committee. These members advised 
on practical issues such as logistics, space, and desk 
mechanics. Participants were invited to a presentation 
of results (two sessions offered at each hospital site), 
and an infographic of the results was designed and 
circulated to participants.
Results
Figure 1 displays the flow of participants through the 
study. Between November 2015 and June 2016, 146 
participants across 37 office clusters were recruited, 
with 19 office clusters (77 participants) randomised 
to the intervention arm (one participant subsequently 
withdrew before intervention implementation, leaving 
76 participants) and 18 clusters to the control arm (69 
participants). Of these, 121 (83%), 115 (79%), and 
109 (75%) participants and 100%, 100%, and 95% of 
clusters were seen at the 3, 6, and 12 month follow-
up, respectively. More participants in the control group 
than intervention group withdrew from the study 
(control 33% v intervention 17%).
Baseline characteristics
Table 1 presents the overall characteristics of the office 
clusters and the individual participants within these 
clusters. Office clusters ranged in size from one to 16 
participants, with a mean of four participants in each 
cluster. The mean age of participants was 41.2 (SD 
11.1) years, 78% reported being of white European 
ethnicity, and the majority were women (80%). Most 
of the participants (74%) worked full time and were 
spread across different NHS salary bands. On average, 
participants spent 72.6% (5.94 (SD 1.47) h/workday) 
of their work hours sitting, of which 47.1% (2.80 
(1.60) h/workday) was accrued in prolonged bouts, 
20.0% (3.84 (1.07) h/workday) was standing, and 
7.5% (1.64 (0.29 h/workday) was stepping. Across 
daily waking hours, participants spent 63.7% (9.71 
(1.55) h/day) of their day sitting, of which 51.4% 
(4.99 (1.75) h/day) was prolonged sitting, 25.3% 
(3.84 (1.34) h/day) standing, and 10.8% (1.64 (0.52) 
h/day) stepping. There were no significant differences 
between those with available primary outcome data 
at both baseline and 12 months and those without for 
the characteristics reported in table 1, except for salary 
banding (those on a higher salary were less likely to 
have available data). Participant characteristics of 
intervention and control participants were similar, 
except for ethnicity and sex. The intervention group 
consisted of more South Asian (21% v 13%) and more 
male (27% v 13%) participants than the control group. 
Of the participants randomised to the intervention, 
40% (n=30) chose a full electric desk and 60% (n=46) 
chose the desk platform.

between groups at 12 month follow-up. In the complete 
case analysis, a statistically significant difference 
between groups was found in occupational sitting 
time (adjusted difference −83.28 min/workday, 95% 
confidence interval −116.57 to −49.98 min/workday) 
in favour of the intervention group. Similar results were 
seen in the intention to treat analysis (table 2).
Sensitivity analyses (table 2) showed similar results 
to the primary analysis for occupational sitting time, 
with statistically significant differences between groups 
at 12 months when the various levels of activPAL data 
were used (ie, including only those with at least two 
and three valid days). Although a significant difference 
between groups for occupational sitting was found 
when standardising the data to an eight hour workday, 
the difference was smaller (−41.29 min/8 h workday).
Figure 2 shows the results of the subgroup analyses. 
No statistically significant interaction effects were 
found for change in occupational sitting time.
Secondary outcomes
activPAL and ActiGraph outcomes
Table 3 presents the secondary outcomes collected 
by the activPAL and ActiGraph. Differences between 
groups were found in occupational sitting time at three 
months (−50.62 min/workday) and six months (−64.40 
min/workday) and daily sitting time at six (−59.32 
min/workday) and 12 months (−82.39 min/workday) 
in favour of the intervention group compared with 
control, indicating that the intervention group spent 
significantly less time sitting than the control group. 
Similar results for daily sitting time at 12 months 
were seen in the intention to treat analysis, when 
standardising the daily sitting time data to a 16 hour 
waking day and when the various levels of activPAL 
data were used (ie, including only those with at least 
two and three valid days) (data not shown). Figure 2 
displays the results of the subgroup analyses for daily 
sitting time at 12 months. For most subgroups there 
were no interaction effects. However, an interaction 
effect was found for age. At 12 months, the between 
subgroup interaction effects (P=0.02) revealed that the 
intervention was more effective for participants above 
the median age (42.5 years), who reduced their daily 
sitting by 45.11 additional minutes daily than those 
below the median age.
Differences were found between groups in prolonged 
sitting time at six months (occupational: −35.31 min/
workday, daily: −25.38 min/day) and 12 months 
(occupational: −44.93 min/workday, daily: −58.34 
min/day) in favour of the intervention group compared 
with control, but not at three months.
The intervention group stood more than the control 
group at all time points, with group differences in 
occupational standing of 48.91, 72.62, and 66.00 min/
workday, respectively, and in daily standing of 36.95, 
55.96, and 62.81 min/day, respectively. No differences 
were found in occupational or daily stepping time 
and moderate to vigorous physical activity at any time 
point as measured by the ActiGraph (P>0.05).
Musculoskeletal problems
At baseline, a high proportion of participants in 
both groups reported experiencing musculoskeletal 
problems 
in 
the 
previous 
12 
months 
(see

for musculoskeletal problems reported over the past 
seven days for the neck and upper extremity areas 
at 12 month follow-up and any part at six months, 
with the odds of reporting problems being less in the 
intervention group.
Work related outcomes
Work engagement—Differences (in favour of the 
intervention group versus control) at six and 12 
months were observed for the vigour subscale and 
for overall work engagement (see supplementary 
table 3). Differences at 12 months (in favour of the 
intervention group) were seen for work dedication 
and work absorption. No differences were found at 
three months.
Job satisfaction and performance and occupational 
fatigue—Differences at six and 12 months (in favour 
of the intervention group) were observed in job 
performance and recovery from occupational fatigue, 
but not in job satisfaction. No differences were found 
at three months.
Sickness presenteeism—Differences were observed 
between groups, in favour of the intervention 
group compared with control, in the scales of time 
management and mental-interpersonal demands 
and for overall sickness presenteeism at 12 and three 
months, respectively.
Sickness absence—No differences between groups 
were seen for either self reported or organisation 
reported (see supplementary table 4) sickness absence 
from work (P>0.05).
Cognitive function outcomes
Supplementary table 5 displays the results for the 
cognitive function tests. There were differences between 
groups in reaction times at 3, 6, and 12 months for the 
congruent level of the Stroop Colour-Word Test and 
in proportion of correct hits at the incongruent level, 
all in favour of the intervention group compared with 
control.
Mood, mental health, and quality of life
For most mood affect variables no differences were 
observed between groups (see supplementary table 6). 
However, differences were found for anxiety today at 
six and 12 months and dysphoria today at six months, 
in favour of the intervention compared with control.
Between group differences were found for anxiety 
generally at three months, hostility generally at 12 
months, and dysphoria generally at three months, in 
favour of the control group.
Quality of life was assessed in four individual domains 
and overall (see supplementary table 7). Between 
group differences were found in two domains of quality 
of life and for the overall score at six and 12 months, 
all in favour of the intervention group compared with 
control. Participants in the intervention group compared 
with control group reported an improvement in their 
psychological, environmental, and overall quality of life.
Discussion
This cluster randomised controlled trial evaluated 
the effectiveness of a multicomponent intervention, 
involving a height adjustable workstation, for reducing 
occupational sitting time in a sample of office workers 
based within the University Hospitals of Leicester 
NHS Trust. The SMArT Work intervention resulted in 
reductions in occupational and daily sitting time over 
the short (three months), medium (six months), and 
longer term (12 months). The reduction in sitting was 
largely replaced by time spent standing, as stepping 
time remained unchanged. Although a reduction in 
daily sitting time was observed, this was of a similar 
magnitude to the reduction seen during work time, 
suggesting that the changes seen for daily sitting time 
were likely due to changes made at work. Time spent in 
prolonged sitting was also reduced in the intervention 
group. Results were also suggestive of improvements 
and benefits in assessed secondary outcomes, 
including 
job 
performance, 
work 
engagement, 
occupational fatigue, sickness presenteeism, and

psychological health, although these tended to be at 
the later follow-up time points. No notable changes 
were found in job satisfaction, cognitive function, and 
sickness absence.
Comparison with other studies
The majority of previous workplace interventions 
employing height adjustable workstations have been 
evaluated over the short term (eg, three months) 
using small samples, and observed sitting reductions 
of between 30 minutes and two hours daily,25 which 
is comparable with the present study. Other recent 
larger studies, evaluating similar multicomponent 
interventions, have also exhibited similar behaviour 
changes.29 67 However, although these studies observed 
reductions at their concluding assessment time point, 
these tended to be smaller than those observed at 
the shorter term follow-up. In the present study, the 
reductions in sitting at three months were not only 
maintained at both subsequent follow-up time points 
(six and 12 months) but were largest at the final follow-
up assessment at 12 months. We included a six month 
follow-up assessment where participants received 
feedback on their health and behaviour, and one-to-one 
coaching was continued throughout the whole study 
period. This may indicate that the ongoing coaching

initial behaviour change. The value of regular contact 
was highlighted as a motivating factor in the process 
evaluation focus groups. A previous study targeting 
sitting also highlighted that regular assessments 
motivated participants.68
Consistent with previous research,26 29 67 sitting 
was replaced with standing rather than ambulation, 
despite emphasis on both behaviours. Participants 
may have chosen to reduce their sitting time by 
performing work tasks standing at their desk rather 
than reducing and breaking up their sitting through 
activities such as using a toilet, printer, or water cooler 
further away, walking meetings, or a combination of 
both strategies, suggestions that were promoted in the 
intervention. More qualitative research may be needed 
to elicit how best to encourage changes in movement 
while at work, in terms of the ability to perform work 
tasks more actively and to incorporate more movement 
during work breaks.
Participants in the intervention group on average 
reduced their sitting time by more than an hour 
daily (95% confidence interval of 40 to >85 min/
day reduction in sitting), and a recent meta-analysis 
examining the strength and shape of the dose-response 
relation between sedentary behaviour and health 
outcomes, suggests that this may have meaningful 
health benefits.69 For example, the increased risk of 
all cause and cardiovascular mortality was strongest 
for those sitting for more than 8 h/day (relative risk of 
1.04 for each additional hour after eight hours) and 
6 h/day (relative risk of 1.04 for each additional hour 
after six hours), respectively. The average daily sitting 
time of the intervention group at baseline was 9.7 h/
day. Furthermore, the association between sitting time

and type 2 diabetes appeared to be linear, suggesting 
that any reduction may be beneficial. However, the 
acute experimental evidence is equivocal for replacing 
sitting time with standing time and the resulting 
metabolic health benefits, with one study showing that 
breaking up sitting with standing has acute beneficial 
effects on postprandial metabolic health in those with 
impaired glucose regulation,15 with other studies 
reporting a modest16 70 or no effect19 71 in healthy 
populations. Future studies are therefore needed to 
assess the benefit of displacing sitting with standing 
on health outcomes over the longer term. Nevertheless, 
an increase in standing seemed to have a positive 
impact on many work related outcomes such as job 
performance, work engagement, occupational fatigue, 
sickness presenteesim, and some musculoskeletal 
problems. In previous similar shorter term (eg, three 
months) interventions, self reported or objectively 
measured work performance were not negatively or 
positively affected.25 26 Our findings suggest that this 
type of intervention may take time to positively affect 
work performance, as these differences were observed 
in the present study at six and 12 months.
While levels of sickness absence across the UK have 
remained relatively stable (6.6 days per person in 
2014 and 6.9 days per person in 2015), presenteeism 
is a growing problem for employers. Consequently, 
presenteeism is now more costly than sickness 
absenteeism, £21.2 bn per annum versus £10.6 bn 
per annum, respectively.72 Work engagement is an 
important indicator of productivity, turnover, and 
wellbeing of the workforce,46 73 and occupational 
fatigue has been associated with unintentional 
injuries at work74 and health problems,75 76 while 
both have been linked to sickness absenteeism.75 77 78 
Despite positive changes to work engagement (all 
subscales at 12 months and overall work engagement) 
and occupational fatigue, we did not observe any 
differences in self reported or organisational records 
of sickness absence. Given that the positive changes 
observed in other work related outcomes occurred later 
in the randomised controlled trial (six and 12 months), 
any impact on sickness absenteeism may emerge 
in future months. Nevertheless, positive changes in 
sickness presenteeism were found for the domains 
of 
time 
management 
and 
mental-interpersonal 
demands, when measured using the Work Limitations 
Questionnaire.
Recent data reported that half a million employees 
experienced work related musculoskeletal disorders 
in Great Britain in 2016-17, which resulted in 8.9 
million working days lost.79 We also observed a high 
prevalence of musculoskeletal conditions in this 
office based sample and although we did not find 
any differences reported over the whole 12 month 
randomised controlled trial period, the prevalence of 
neck and upper extremity problems experienced in the 
past seven days at 12 months, and the proportion of 
lower back problems interfering with normal activities, 
was lower in the intervention group. Results from 
previous research with similar interventions have been 
mixed in terms of the benefits for musculoskeletal 
problems. One study reported a non-significant 
increase in musculoskeletal conditions,8 several 
studies reported no differences,26 80 81 whereas other 
studies have reported slight decreases in lower back 
pain,82 upper back pain,65 and neck pain.65 One recent 
review concluded that sit-stand workstations may help 
reduce low back pain in workers.83
A small body of epidemiological evidence suggests 
that lower levels of sedentary behaviour are associated 
with higher quality of life scores.84 85 Our results 
corroborate these findings, with increases in quality of 
life reported by the intervention participants.
Taking these findings together, this type of 
intervention (providing an environmental change 
combined with additional strategies such as education, 
self monitoring, and brief coaching) may be of benefit 
to employers in terms of having more engaged and 
higher performing staff as well as cost saving from 
sickness presenteeism, musculoskeletal problems, 
and potentially sickness absenteeism. A separate 
paper will formally assess the cost effectiveness of the 
intervention.
Strengths and limitations of this study
The strengths of this study include the robust 
randomised controlled design, with randomisation 
at the cluster level, the fully powered sample size, 
the short, medium, and longer term follow up 
assessments, and the device based measurement of 
the primary outcome. Therefore, this study tackles 
many of the limitations of previous evaluations of 
workplace interventions focused on reducing sitting 
time.25 Furthermore, we performed several sensitivity 
analyses to check the robustness of our results. 
Although the study had a 27% loss to follow-up/
non-compliance with primary outcome assessment 
by 12 months, our sample size was sufficiently large 
enough to account for this drop-out. This drop-out/
non-compliance rate is similar to that seen at 12 
months in the Stand Up Victoria study.29 The conduct 
of the present study in an NHS trust is both a strength 
and a limitation. The NHS is the fifth largest employer 
globally, with around 1.3 million staff. Clerical and 
administrative staff make up about a third of NHS 
employees, therefore this intervention has potential 
to reach a large number of people. Conversely, as the 
study was only conducted in a single organisation this 
may limit the generalisibility of the intervention and 
findings to other types of organisations beyond the 
NHS, particularly those with large open plan offices, 
which were rare within the University Hospitals of 
Leicester NHS Trust. Although we used an objective 
assessment of sitting time and physical activity and 
removed the first day of data collection from the 
activPAL, it is possible that reactivity (change in 
behaviour from an awareness of being monitoring) 
may have biased the results. Many of our work related 
outcomes were assessed by self report and may have 
been subject to reporting bias. As SMArT Work was 
a complex intervention it had the potential to exert

effects at many levels, therefore we included many 
outcomes. However, this study was not powered to 
detect differences in all of the measured outcomes, 
and adjustment for multiple comparisons was not 
performed. The emphasis therefore should be on the 
pattern of the secondary outcome results.
Conclusions
The SMArT Work multicomponent intervention was 
able to reduce occupational and daily sitting time in 
the short, medium, and longer term in office workers 
within the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust. 
The intervention also appeared to have a positive impact 
on musculoskeletal conditions and many work related 
outcomes such as job performance, work engagement, 
occupational fatigue, and sickness presenteeism as 
well as being beneficial for psychological outcomes 
such as daily anxiety and quality of life. Areas for 
future research include the replication of these 
findings in other organisations, focusing interventions 
on standing and moving more throughout the whole 
day (ie, taking a whole day approach to reductions 
in sitting), eliciting how best to promote movement 
rather than just standing, and longer term follow up 
to assess maintenance of behaviour change and allow 
sufficient time to impact those outcomes that take 
longer to influence, such as absenteeism.
