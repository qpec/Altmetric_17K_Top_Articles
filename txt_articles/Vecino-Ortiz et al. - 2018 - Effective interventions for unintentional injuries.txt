Effective interventions for unintentional injuries: 
a systematic review and mortality impact assessment among 
the poorest billion
Andres I Vecino-Ortiz, Aisha Jafri, Adnan A Hyder
Summary
Background Between 1990 and 2015, the global injury mortality declined, but in countries where the poorest billion 
live, injuries are becoming an increasingly prevalent cause of death. The vulnerability of this population requires 
immediate attention from policy makers to implement effective interventions that lessen the burden of injuries in 
these countries. Our aim was two-fold; first, to review all the evidence on effective interventions for the five main 
types of unintentional injury; and second, to estimate the potential number of lives saved by effective injury 
interventions among the poorest billion.
Methods For our systematic review we used references in the Disability Control Priorities third edition, and searched 
PubMed and the Cochrane database for papers published until Sept 10, 2016, using a comprehensive search strategy 
to find interventions for the five major causes of unintentional injuries: road traffic crashes, falls, drowning, burns, 
and poisoning. Studies were included if they presented evidence with significant effects sizes for any outcome; no 
inclusions or exclusions made on the basis of where the study was carried out (ie, low-income, middle-income, or 
high-income country). Then we used data from the Global Burden of Disease 2015 study and a Monte Carlo simulation 
technique to estimate the potential annual attributable number of lives saved among the poorest billion by these 
evidence-based injury interventions. We estimated results for 84 countries where the poorest billion live.
Findings From the 513 papers identified, 47 were eligible for inclusion. We identified 11 interventions that had an effect 
on injury mortality. For road traffic deaths, the most successful interventions in preventing deaths are speed 
enforcement (>80 000 lives saved per year) and drink-driving enforcement (>60 000 lives saved per year). Interventions 
potentially most effective in preventing deaths from drowning are formal swimming lessons for children younger than 
14 years (>25 000 lives saved per year) and the use of crèches to supervise younger children (younger than 5 years; 
>10 000 lives saved per year). We did not find sufficient evidence on interventions for other causes of unintentional 
injuries (poisoning, burns, and falls) to run similar simulations.
Interpretation Based on the little available evidence, key interventions have been identified to prevent lives lost from 
unintentional injuries among the poorest billion. This Article provides guidance to national authorities on evidence-based 
priority interventions that can reduce the burden of injuries among the most vulnerable members of the population. We 
also identify an important gap in knowledge on the effectiveness and the mortality impacts of injury interventions.

Introduction
As a result of the rapid wave of urbanisation, demo-
graphic and nutritional transitions, economic growth, 
and technological change, the epidemiological profile of 
most countries has been moving from communicable 
diseases to non-communicable diseases and injuries.1 
However, while the global burden of injuries has 
decreased by 31% in the past 20 years, the injury burden 
due to road injuries and falls in sub-Saharan Africa and 
southeast Asia has increased by 10–50%,2 showing 
how improvements in the injury burden have not 
been equitably distributed. Specifically, unintentional 
injuries are a growing concern. Deaths caused by 
unintentional injuries comprise 10% of all deaths in 
low-income and middle-income countries, compared 
with intentional injuries that cause 3% of all deaths in 
these countries.3
In low-income and middle-income countries, efforts 
to generate a regulatory and societal response to unin-
tentional injuries, and to strengthen safety infra-
structure often lag behind an accelerated development 
rate, leading to an increased risk of injury.1,4–7 High-
income countries followed the same process decades 
ago, but with smaller populations than low-income and 
middle-income countries have nowadays, and with less 
complex systems than are in development now; hence, it 
is much more complex initiating effective interventions 
in these resource-limited settings.

The long-term cost of injuries in low-income and 
middle-income countries include adverse effects on 
health and productivity, and the resulting pressure on 
social systems. The annual gross domestic product, for 
example, has been shown to decrease by 1–3% because 
of road traffic injuries alone,7,8 and this loss would be 
even greater if other unintentional injuries were taken 
into account.
Many chronic conditions are multifactorial and the 
marginal effect of a single intervention is seldom 
evident, thereby requiring more complex and diagonal 
programmes and interventions.9 In the field of injury, a 
single intervention aimed at the prevention and control 
of a risk factor can have a substantial effect on an entire 
target population. For example, in road injuries, a 
single intervention aiming to reduce average speeds or 
increase helmet use can lead to important reductions 
in both the frequency and severity of road injuries.10
The Lancet’s Non-Communicable Disease and Injury 
(NCDI) Poverty Commission has committed to 
facilitating the prioritisation of evidence-based, country-
level investments to reduce the burden of chronic 
conditions and unintentional injuries among the 
poorest billion.11 In this Article, we provide evidence on 
the potential mortality effects that a set of interventions 
to prevent unintentional injury could have on the 
poorest billion people, living in 84 countries across the 
world.11 These countries also have few tools and 
resources to deal with such a burden and, therefore, are 
in greatest need of rigorous prioritisation tools to 
define where to devote intervention investments.12 
The aim of this study was two-fold; first, to review all the 
evidence on effective interventions for the five main 
types of unintentional injury; and second, to estimate 
the potential number of lives saved by effective injury 
interventions among the poorest billion. This study will 
provide tools to prioritise injury interventions for 
national and global health organisations.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
First, we did a literature review to find the effect sizes for 
all unintentional injury interventions for which the data 
showed any significant effect on mortality (ie, p<0·05). 
The systematic review was based on interventions for the 
five main causes of unintentional injuries: road traffic 
crashes, falls, drowning, burns, and poisoning. First we 
reviewed the 89 references from the chapter on Injury in 
the Disease Control Priorities, third edition (DCP-3),13 and 
then did a systematic review on PubMed in the MEDLINE 
database for papers published before Sept 10, 2016, 
in English, Spanish, and Portuguese, using the following 
search terms: (“Accidents, Traffic”[Mesh] AND “Accident 
Prevention”[Majr] 
AND 
“Review”[Publication 
Type]); 
(“Drowning”[Mesh] OR “Near Drowning”[Mesh]) AND 
(“Accident Prevention”[Majr] AND “Review”[Publication 
Type]); ("Accidental Falls"[Mesh] AND “Accident Pre-
vention”[Majr] 
AND 
“Review”[Publication 
Type]); 
("Poisoning"[Mesh] AND “Accident Prevention”[Majr] 
AND “Review”[Publication Type]); and ("Burns"[Mesh] 
AND “Accident Prevention”[Majr] AND “Review"[Publi-
cation Type]). This search was expected to retrieve the most 
relevant, evidence-based interventions rather than all 
interventions with any type of evidence available. Add-
itionally, we reviewed the Cochrane database using the 
MeSH criterion “Accident Prevention”.
To ensure a broad review of the literature, we reviewed 
the titles, abstracts, and content found through this 
search for interventions on unintentional injuries that 
had significant effect sizes for any outcome. No inclusions 
or exclusions were made on the basis of whether the 
study was done in a low-income or middle-income 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
The burden of unintentional injuries is increasing in 
low-income and middle-income countries compared with 
other more traditional causes of disease burden. Low-income 
and middle-income countries comprise 91% of deaths and 
94% of disability-adjusted life-years lost because of 
unintentional injuries; these countries also have most of the 
population that belong to the poorest billion.
Despite the relevance of this subject, no studies appear to have 
determined which evidence-based interventions should be 
prioritised to reduce the burden of unintentional injuries for 
those living in extreme poverty.
Added value of this study
Our study is the first large-scale investigation that reviews 
all the available evidence on effective interventions for the 
five main types of unintentional injury and that estimates 
potential lives saved by a set of injury interventions for 
those living in extreme poverty. We estimated the 
potential mortality impact of selected evidence-based 
interventions for each of the 84 countries where the 
poorest billion live.
Implications of all the available evidence
This study builds on existing work to review all evidence on 
effective interventions for the five main types of 
unintentional injury, and to estimate the potential gains in 
terms of lives saved from a set of evidence-based injury 
interventions. We expect this study to help inform policy 
makers to prioritise unintentional injury interventions in the 
countries where the poorest billion live. We also found that 
the evidence on the effect of injury interventions on mortality 
is sparse and call for global researchers to strengthen efforts 
to study this field.

country, since some evidence on specific interventions is 
only available for high-income countries. We report the 
results from our literature review for any outcome. For 
the mortality estimations, we selected only interventions 
that reported significant results on mortality data.
Data extraction
We extracted data on the type of intervention, the country, 
the specific target population of the intervention, the 
outcome, and the effect size and its corresponding 
confidence interval. We grouped the papers found 
into six categories: (1) device effectiveness, which de-
scribes the effectiveness of specific protective devices 
(eg, seat-belt, helmet); (2) community interventions, 
including social-marketing campaigns; (3) enforcement; 
(4) guidelines; (5) infrastructure (ie, changes that improve 
safety); and (6) law or legislation aimed at improving 
safety. However, some papers described the effect of 
packages instead of single interventions, and since 
the specific effects of each intervention in such 
packages could not be disentangled, these papers were 
assessed separately.
Selection of countries
We estimated the potential effect that these interventions 
would have if implemented in the countries identified by 
The Lancet’s NCDI Poverty Commission as being home to 
the poorest billion people worldwide.11 The selection of 
countries was done by the Oxford Poverty & Human 
Development Initiative (OPHI), a member of the NCDI 
commission.14 102 countries were selected by OPHI 
because they had comparable survey data between 
2005 and 2015 that allowed estimation of the 2016 Multi-
dimensional Poverty Index (MPI).14 These 102 countries 
make up 75% of the global population. In all these 
countries, OPHI calculated the sum of all households 
living with 100% of deprivations, and sequentially included 
those with lower levels of deprivations (ie, 99%, then 98%, 
then 97%, and so on) until reaching 44% of deprivations, 
which constitutes 1·06 billion people. These individuals 
live in households that are considered to be in extreme 
poverty in both low-income and middle-income countries. 
In fact, people live in households with more than 44% of 
deprivations in countries other than the 102 assessed by 
OPHI; however, we do not have data to estimate the 
population size living with more than 44% of deprivations 
in those countries, and therefore we limited our 
estimations to the countries with an MPI measured 
by OPHI.
Of the 102 countries selected by OPHI for their 
MPI estimations, three countries had MPI measures 
but they were incomplete (Barbados, Palestine, and 
Saint Lucia), six countries had no mortality or baseline 
injury data (Burundi, Comoros, Haiti, South Sudan, Syria, 
and Ukraine), and nine countries had zero or an unknown 
percentage of the population living in the poorest billion 
(Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Egypt, 
Jordan, Kazakhstan, Libya, Macedonia, and Trinidad and 
Tobago). Therefore, these 18 countries were excluded 
since we did not obtain enough data to do our estimations. 
Our study focuses on the remaining 84 countries.
Data analysis
Next, we used the effect sizes on mortality found from the 
literature review to estimate the number of lives potentially 
saved per year among the poorest billion by each evidence-
based intervention.11 We used a population attributable 
fraction (PAF) estimation and a Monte Carlo simulation 
technique, similar to previous research work measuring 
population-level interventions.15,16
For the lives saved estimation-modelling exercise, we 
selected only interventions for which the outcome was 
mortality change. We excluded interventions for falls for 
institutionalised individuals because this issue mostly 
takes place in high-income countries, and “raising the 
minimum legal drinking age by 3 years” for road traffic 
injuries, because we only have data on the age of the 
casualty, not the driver, which prevents us from estimating 
the effect of this intervention. The eligible interventions 
were then subcategorised into conceptually related 
interventions, similar to what was done in DCP-3, to get 
ranges for their effect sizes.17
For mortality estimations, we used data from the Global 
Burden of Disease 2015 (GBD 2015) study for total number 
of deaths, by age for both sexes, per country and injury 
cause (road injury, two-wheel and four-wheel vehicle 
road injury, and drowning).18 Since the GBD 2015 study 
only provides estimates for the mean, minimum, and 
maximum values (instead of the mean and some type of 
dispersion metric, such as standard deviation), use of 
a normal distribution was not possible. The most 
appropriate distribution in this case was a triangular 
distribution, which allowed us to set a minimum, mean, 
and maximum value for both the effect sizes and deaths. 
Estimates on the potential annual lives saved per country 
and by intervention are available in the appendix. As a 
robustness check for this distributional assumption, we 
did sensitivity analyses using a uniform distribution. The 
results of these additional analyses are available on request 
from the corresponding author. Additionally, given that 
not all countries have the same level of baseline 
enforcement of interventions (specifically for road safety), 
we used data from the Global Status Report on Road 
Safety 2015 to account for baseline conditions of enforce-
ment for road safety interventions.19
To estimate the PAF of the risk factor avoided through 
the evidence-based intervention, we matched the effect 
sizes found for each intervention from the literature 
review with the mortality data of the corresponding target 
population on the basis of country, age category, and cause 
of death, as shown in equation 1:

where RR is relative risk, and the estimated number of 
lives saved is a function of the number of deaths of each 
country (i), cause of death (k), and the mortality prevented 
by intervention (j).
Our PAF estimations are similar to those used by 
Lee and colleagues16 as a method to evaluate the PAF for 
the population as a whole by use of unadjusted RRs.
Using Monte Carlo simulations with 10 000 iterations, 
we obtained uncertainty estimates by intervention and 
country.
Specifically, the intervention of compulsory personal 
flotation device wearing prevents drowning when boating. 
Statistics on drowning when boating are not systematically 
reported for every country; however, some evidence shows 
that boating is the activity before drowning in 16–30% of 
cases of drowning.20,21 Therefore, we conservatively 
estimated the effect of this intervention to be effective for 
16% of all drowning deaths, as shown in equation 2: 
For road traffic interventions, we included into 
equation 1 a variable indicating baseline enforcement for 
each risk factor that is affected by road safety interventions 
based on data from the Global Status Report on Road 
Safety 2015 (equation 3).19 
For countries with no helmet laws, we made separate 
estimations of the effect of the enactment of the helmet 
law and the effect of helmet enforcement. We did not 
estimate the effect of enacting helmet laws in countries 
that already had one.
For all the estimations, we made several assumptions. 
First, we assumed independence of the interventions, 
which implies that each intervention is assessed 
independently of other concurrent interventions. This 
assumption is important because the effectiveness 
parameters come from studies that assess the 
independent effect of each intervention. In this study, 
we are not able to account for either the potential 
synergy (multiplicative effect) or any reductions in the 
marginal benefit obtained from a single intervention 
when combined with another. Second, we assumed that 
the interventions are based on national policies that 
affect the entire population at risk, and do not only 
focus on individuals living in poverty. Therefore, our 
study assumes that the probability of any intervention 
saving a life is the same for a person who is or is not in 
the poorest billion. This assumption is likely to be 
conservative since individuals belonging to the poorest 
billion are likely to have a higher-than-average exposure 
to risk factors for injuries—eg, speed reduction 
interventions reduce the risk of injury more for 
vulnerable people who live or work close to unsafe roads 
than for those living in areas where urban characteristics 
protect them from speeding vehicles; and swimming 
lessons would reduce the risk of drowning to a greater 
extent among poorer children who are more likely to 
live closer to bodies of water than those of a 
higher socioeconomic background. Third, we assumed 
that the effect sizes of the interventions found in the 
literature would be transferable to the countries targeted 
by the Lancet NCDI Poverty Commission if the inter-
ventions were act 
ually implemented. Assuming an 
appropriate imple 
mentation of these interventions, we 
estimated the potential lives saved. We cannot be certain 
about whether the effectiveness of these interventions is 
systematically larger or smaller in low-income and 
middle-income countries than in high-income coun-
tries. On the one hand, higher-income countries have 
more resources and an enabling context to implement 
these strategies in a more effective manner than 
low-income and middle-income countries. On the 
other hand, if the implementation is properly done, 
the marginal effect of the intervention is likely to be 
higher in low-income and middle-income countries than 
in high-income countries, since the proportion of the 
population at high risk is larger and other interventions 
might not be in place. For this reason, whether the full 
implementation of these interventions would have larger 
or smaller effectiveness parameters in low-income and 
middle-income countries than in high-income countries 
is unclear. Finally, we assumed that countries report-
ing unknown enforcement for drink driving (Benin,

Safety Programme;65 including exclusive motorcycle lanes, road safety auditing, and selective enforcement. The programme aimed to modify road-user attitudes and behaviour on motorcycle safety issues, 
including proper use of helmets and excessive speeding. †Several changes were introduced, including: new central curbed median (0·65 m wide); top layer removal and repaving (with an anti-skid bituminous 
material in selected bends); reconstruction of the wall that protects the road from the sea; introduction of widening and superelevation in some horizontal curves; and changes in the safety equipment, including 
a complete review of vertical signs, considering the urban character of the area, lowering of speed limits and application of speed-actuated signals for speed control. ‡Applicable to rural population.

excluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria, leaving 
47 papers for analysis (figure). We found 73 single 
interventions within the identified studies (table 1) and 
32 packages of interventions (table 2) that matched the 
inclusion criteria.
For the PAF estimations and given the heterogeneity 
of the interventions, all interventions were grouped 
into categories of conceptually related interventions, 
similar to what has been done in DCP-3, and assigned 
upper and lower bounds of effectiveness on the basis of 
the most and least effective interventions found in the 
literature review (table 3).17 Our review only found 
11 conceptually related interventions with a significant 
effect on mortality: six for road traffic injuries and five for 
drowning. There were no data on mortality for inter-
ventions that addressed falls, burns, or poisoning, and 
the effect sizes were mostly obtained from interventions 
carried out in higher-income countries.
The potential mean number of lives saved by intervention 
in each country, including minimum and maximum 
values are shown in the appendix. The road traffic safety 
intervention that has the potential to save the most lives is 
speed enforcement (>80 000 lives saved per year across all 
84 countries; table 4), with drink-driving enforcement 
being the next best intervention (>60 000 lives saved per 
year across all 84 countries). In the case of the helmet-use 
law, seven of the 84 countries assessed do not have such 
a law according to the Global Status Report on Road 
Safety 2015, and therefore the effects of this intervention 
were estimated for these seven countries.
For the prevention of drowning, all countries seem to 
save the most lives by providing formal swimming 
lessons (>25 000 lives saved per year across all 84 coun-
tries) followed by placing children aged 1–4 years in 
crèches under institutional supervision as the next best 
intervention (>10 000 lives saved per year across all 
84 countries).
Baseline data on the proportion of the poorest billion 
exposed, enforcement levels, and mortality by cause of 
injury are very heterogeneous across the 84 countries.
Discussion
Our study shows the main evidence-based interventions 
that can potentially reduce the burden of fatal injuries 
among the poorest billion. Our results show that, 
among the poorest billion, more than 250 000 lives 
could be saved every year if the 11 interventions 
discussed here were implemented in the 84 countries 
where the poorest billion live. 
As injury incidence, and its associated mortality and 
disability, steadily increase in low-income and middle-
income countries, a need for evidence-based inter-
ventions to curb this trend is urgently needed.1,4–7 In this 
Article, we estimate the potential lives saved by evidence-
based injury interventions in the 84 countries where the 
poorest billion live.11 This paper might be of assistance to

policy makers by highlighting the limitations of the 
epidemiological literature as a guide to injury prevention, 
and by providing estimates of the lives that could 
potentially be saved with widespread implementation of 
the few interventions for which evidence was sufficient 
to allow estimation. These data can be used by decision 
makers for their own cost-effectiveness and feasibility 
studies in the context of their own countries and by 
policy makers to assess the potential return on 
investment in terms of lives saved per year of prioritised 
interventions. To the best of our knowledge, this 
study is the first to estimate the effects of injury inter-
ventions at this scale among the poorest billion of the 
global population.
Despite the increasing awareness that injuries are an 
important cause of death and the progress that has been 
made on developing injury interventions,1 we found few 
data describing the impact of these interventions on 
lives saved. From our broad literature review we only 
found 11 interventions for two types of injuries—road 
traffic injuries and drowning—with a minimum level of 
evidence on their effects on mortality. This fact is 
striking since injuries are a leading cause of global 
deaths,1 and policy makers working on injury inter-
ventions do not have sufficient evidence to facilitate 
their prioritisation and decision-making processes. 
Therefore, our study reveals a potentially crucial gap in 
research in terms of the mortality impact of injury 
interventions. We strongly encourage global health 
researchers to focus their attention on studying injury 
interventions since unintentional injuries have become 
a large global burden.
We also highlight the important role of unintentional 
injury interventions, legislation, and enforcement at a 
national level. Although our focus was on the population 
living in extreme poverty, we found that the interventions 
with stronger effects on mortality are those that are 
scalable at the national level, implying that these 
interventions could benefit a larger population than the 
one specifically measured in this study.
We also show the relevance of country-specific priority 
setting. We found a considerable heterogeneity in the 
baseline levels of the variables used in our estimation—
eg, the percentage of the population belonging to the 
poorest billion, enforcement levels, and mortality for each 
cause of injury. This variability reflects the need for 
differential approaches for each country when prioritising 
injury interventions. We also provide data on the effect on 
mortality among the poorest billion of each evidence-
based intervention by country, facilitating priority setting 
and the policy-making process of reducing the burden 
of injuries.
For measurement purposes, we assumed the inde-
pendence of interventions in this study; however, we 
encourage researchers to study groups of interventions 
and decision makers to consider implementing sets of 
interventions when possible.23
The definition of poverty used by the Lancet NCDI 
Poverty Commission is a static measurement that does 
not account for changes over time in poverty levels and 
deprivations. Evidence shows that multidimensional 
poverty reduces over time at heterogeneous rates,76 so our 
estimates on the effect of interventions on mortaility 
among the poorest billion reflect projected outcomes in 
the short and medium term should these interventions be 
successfully implemented in these countries.
This work has several limitations contingent on the little 
available evidence on injury interventions, data sources, 
and the assumptions of the model we used. First, the 
estimations assume that the probability of any intervention 
to save the life of a person who is or is not among the 
poorest billion is equal. This assumption probably 
underestimates the number of lives saved since these 
interventions, if properly implemented, should provide 
more protection to those living in extreme poverty given 
their higher vulnerability and higher exposure to injury 
risk factors than to those not living in poverty. Second, we 
also assume that the effect sizes reported in the literature 
and found in higher-income countries are transferable to 
lower-income countries. For this assumption to be valid, 
we acknowledge that higher-income countries provide an 
enabling context for improving road safety, and these 
results assume that these interventions would be properly 
implemented. We believe this assumption is plausible if 
the intervention is properly implemented. Moreover, our 
estimates are a lower bound for the potential lives saved, 
since people included in the poorest billion might benefit 
even more from these interventions if they usually have a 
higher risk of injuries than the populations in which the 
estimates were obtained. Third, by only estimating the 
single effect of each intervention in each country, we 
cannot predict whether two or more of those interventions 
implemented concurrently would yield results equal,

inferior, or superior to the sum of the isolated effects of the 
interventions. Fourth, the mortality data we used from the 
GBD 2015 study come from mortality estimates; therefore, 
our results rely on the precision of the estimates of the 
GBD 2015 study and on the enforcement scores from the 
Global Status Report on Road Safety 2015. However, these 
studies are the best available data to date. Fifth, given 
that our estimations use RRs with different levels of 
adjustment, depending on the studies from which they 
were retrieved, some confounding is likely. Therefore, 
although we attempt to predict the effect of each 
intervention in every one of the 84 countries, we cannot 
make causal claims with the existing data.16 Sixth, non-fatal 
injuries are characterised by severe measurement issues 
that increase the risk of bias as such we decided not to 
include non-fatal injuries in our estimations. However, by 
only presenting data on fatal injuries, we are observing the 
lower bound of the effectiveness of these interventions, 
and so we expect the gains would increase if non-fatal 
injuries were also taken into account. Finally, we selected 
highly proven inter 
ventions using statistical significance 
as a criterion rather than other criteria, such as the 
magnitude of the effect. We decided to be conservative and 
only include interventions with highly proven effects since 
we are suggesting the implementation of these 
interventions in countries that need prioritisation of their 
scarce resources. As a consequence, interventions such as 
improvements in road and vehicle design and signalling 
for road safety could potentially be effective, but we 
excluded them because little evidence on these 
interventions was found in our literature review. To prevent 
injuries, a comprehensive approach is recommended and 
our findings do not imply that a comprehensive approach 
should not be taken or that interventions that are not 
included here are not effective. Rather, our findings show 
that some specific inter 
ventions have been highly effective 
and that they should be prioritised in countries in which 
the poorest billion live. Our findings also reveal a 
concerning gap in the literature on the effectiveness of 
such comprehensive strategies, and this gap is one of the 
key findings of our research.
We hope that this research on the potential number of 
lives saved among those living in extreme poverty by a 
single evidence-based injury intervention will be of use as 
a tool for policy makers. Our research also reveals 
important gaps in the literature on the impact of injury 
interventions on mortality. We call for more research on 
injuries to estimate the effect of injury interventions on 
mortality and disability and to provide better priority-
setting tools for policy makers in countries where the 
poorest billion live.
