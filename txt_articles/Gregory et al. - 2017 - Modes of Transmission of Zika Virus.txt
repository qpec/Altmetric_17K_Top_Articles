For >60 years, Zika virus (ZIKV) has been recognized as an arthropod-borne virus with Aedes species mosquitoes as the primary 
vector. However in the past 10 years, multiple alternative routes of ZIKV transmission have been identified. We review the availa-
ble data on vector and non-vector-borne modes of transmission and interventions undertaken, to date, to reduce the risk of human 
infection through these routes. Although much has been learned during the outbreak in the Americas on the underlying mecha-
nisms and pathogenesis of non-vector-borne ZIKV infections, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the relative incidence 
of, and risk from, these modes compared to mosquito transmission. Additional research is urgently needed on the risk, pathogenesis, 
and effectiveness of measures to mitigate non-vector-borne ZIKV transmission.

Since the initial isolation of Zika virus (ZIKV) in 1947 as part 
of investigations by the Rockefeller Institute to characterize the 
yellow fever transmission cycle and its identification the follow-
ing year in canopy-dwelling Aedes africanus mosquitoes [1], 
ZIKV has been recognized as an arthropod-borne virus (arbo-
virus). Since then, multiple confirmed, probable, and poten-
tial secondary modes of transmission have been identified. In 
this article, we review the available data on known and possi-
ble transmission modes of ZIKV and preventive measures to 
reduce the risk of human-to-human spread.
MOSQUITO 
TRANSMISSION
Epidemiology
In Africa, ZIKV circulates in a sylvatic transmission cycle 
involving nonhuman primates (NHPs) and forest-dwelling 
Aedes species mosquitoes. As with yellow fever, human expo-
sure to ZIKV may occur from mosquitoes participating in this 
sylvatic transmission cycle. In Asia, no evidence exists for a 
sylvatic transmission cycle, but surveillance for sylvatic arbo-
viruses is lacking in that region. In addition, ZIKV joins yel-
low fever, chikungunya, and dengue viruses as a select group of 
emerging arboviruses capable of sustained transmission in an 
urban human–mosquito–human transmission cycle.
The extent of viral transmission to humans that results from 
exposure to the sylvatic transmission cycle has not been well 
defined, in part because of lack of surveillance as well as sero-
logic cross-reactivity with other circulating flaviviruses. In 
asymptomatic African residents, seroprevalences of anti-Zika 
antibodies as high as 26% have been observed in Angola [2] 
A recent study examining blood samples collected over 20 years 
from 3 distinct cohorts of clinic patients showed that 5%–8% 
had serologic evidence of past Zika virus infection by immu-
noglobulin M (IgM) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) [3]. However, it cannot be definitely determined to 
what extent this exposure resulted from sylvatic vs urban trans-
mission and to what extent serologic cross-reactivity influenced 
the results. In recent years, as the virus has spread to the Pacific 
Islands and the Americas, the urban transmission cycle has 
accounted for hundreds of thousands of recorded cases.
Biology and Pathophysiology
Several mosquito species primarily belonging to the Aedes 
(Stegomyia), Aedes (Diceromyia), and Aedes (Fredwardsius) 
subgenera, including Aedes africanus, Aedes luteocephalus, 
Aedes furcifer, and Aedes vittatus, are likely enzootic vectors 
in Africa [4–7]. Little is known about the epidemiology and 
potential animal reservoirs for ZIKV in Africa. Serological evi-
dence of Zika virus exposure in NHPs has been observed in 
several sub-Saharan countries including the Central African 
Republic, Ethiopia, Gabon, Nigeria, Senegal, and Uganda [8]. 
A recent study indicated that up to 16% of some populations of 
wild African green monkeys and baboons have been exposed 
to ZIKV, even in areas where ZIKV infections in humans have 
not been observed [9]. While evidence indicates that NHPs play 
a critical role in viral transmission in Africa, serological inves-
tigations demonstrating antibodies against Zika virus in many 
animal species raise questions about the relative importance of 
other animal species [10]. Limited data exist as to the level of 
host competence present in NHPs during natural infection, but 
viremia levels in experimental NHP models of infection have 
been in a range compatible with the ability to infect a feeding

mosquito for other flaviviruses [11]. Modeling work is support-
ive of the potential to establish sylvatic ZIKV transmission in a 
wide range of potential settings [12].
Aedes aegypti has been linked with nearly all known urban 
Zika virus outbreaks, although two other Aedes (Stegomyia) 
species, Aedes hensilli and Aedes polynesiensis, were thought 
to be vectors in outbreaks in Yap State, Federated States of 
Micronesia [13] and in French Polynesia [14], respectively. 
Aedes aegypti is widely distributed throughout the tropical and 
subtropical world. In the United States, Aedes aegypti is endemic 
throughout Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands and in parts 
of the contiguous United States and Hawaii [15, 16]. Despite 
the presence of Ae. aegypti in many areas of the contiguous 
United States, as of April 2017, autochthonous mosquito-borne 
transmission has only occurred in Florida and southern Texas, 
which suggests that other unknown factors greatly influence 
transmission. This finding is consistent with a similar restricted 
transmission range observed in the contiguous United States for 
dengue virus, another flavivirus also transmitted by Ae. aegypti 
[17, 18]. Investigations of dengue outbreaks in the continental 
United States have indicated that socioeconomic and infra-
structure factors such as the use of air-conditioning is associ-
ated with lower levels of infection [17, 19].
Despite its association with outbreaks, studies examining 
competency of Ae. aegypti to transmit ZIKV, usually deter-
mined by a high proportion of infected mosquitoes with infec-
tious saliva following ingestion of an infected blood meal, have 
yielded mixed results. Some studies have demonstrated high 
competency [20], others low competency [5, 21], and yet oth-
ers variable competency depending on the geographic origin of 
the Ae. aegypti tested, Zika viral strain, or mode of mosquito 
infection [22–24]. Two studies suggested higher vector compe-
tence of Ae. aegypti infected with African compared to Asian 
genotype strains [22, 23, 25]. Regardless, Ae. aegypti is thought 
to have high vectorial capacity (the overall ability of a vector 
species to transmit a pathogen in a given location and at a spe-
cific time) as it primarily feeds on humans, often bites multiple 
humans in a single blood meal, and lives in close association 
with human habitation [26]. Vertical transmission of Zika virus 
in Ae. aegypti has been demonstrated, but its role in maintain-
ing the virus is unknown [27, 28].
ZIKV has infrequently been identified from >25 mosquito 
species [4, 29, 30] and, in particular, the role of Aedes albopic-
tus and Culex species mosquitoes in viral transmission has been 
debated. Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus are the only known 
Aedes (Stegomyia) species endemic in the Americas. The con-
cern about the vector potential of Ae. albopictus stems from the 
fact that its range extends beyond that of Ae. aegypti to more 
temperate climates, thus potentially expanding the areas at risk 
for outbreaks. The authors of one study in Gabon speculated 
that Ae. albopictus may have been a vector in an area with scarce 
Ae. aegypti and abundant Ae. albopictus populations and where 
mosquito testing identified ZIKV infections only in Ae. albop-
ictus [31]. However, mosquito-borne transmission has not been 
detected in areas of the United States and Europe endemic for 
Ae. albopictus but not Ae. aegypti despite the influx of thou-
sands of infected travelers returning to those areas from areas 
of ongoing transmission in 2016. Vector competence studies for 
Ae. albopictus have yielded mixed results, demonstrating high 
[32], medium [33, 34], or low competence for ZIKV [21, 23]. 
Differing conditions used in these studies including the source 
and treatment of the ZIKV used, the mosquito populations 
employed, and route of infection (artificial blood meals vs feed-
ing on viremic animals) likely explain at least some of the vari-
ability in these results. As Ae. albopictus does not live in such 
close proximity to humans as Ae. aegypti and does not prefer-
entially feed on humans, it is thought to have a lower inherent 
vectorial capacity than Ae. aegypti. The potential role of Culex 
mosquitoes as ZIKV vectors has been debated [35]. One study 
suggested Culex quinquefasciatus as a competent vector [36]; 
however, many other studies have failed to demonstrate vector 
competence of Culex pipiens [25, 37–39], Cx. quinquefasciatus 
[25, 33, 39–41], and Culex tarsalis [25].
Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions
Little is known about the enzootic transmission cycles for ZIKV. 
Particular areas of future emphasis include further definition of 
the enzootic cycle in Africa and its impact on human infection 
incidence, determining whether an enzootic transmission cycle 
exists in Asia, and whether an enzootic transmission cycle will 
develop in the Americas. Although inoculation of a large num-
ber of North American animal species failed to find any that 
developed sufficient viremia to implicate them as a potential res-
ervoir species [10], further work globally could help determine 
the importance, if any, of other animal species beyond NHPs 
in maintaining the virus. Finally, given the importance of Ae. 
aegypti as a transmission vector, further development of effec-
tive prevention and control measures are important priorities.
SEXUAL 
TRANSMISSION
Epidemiology
Possible sexual transmission of ZIKV was initially reported in 
2008 [42]. Six days after returning home from Senegal (an area 
with known ZIKV presence), an American scientist developed 
hematospermia and other symptoms compatible with ZIKV 
disease. Four days later, his wife, who had not traveled inter-
nationally in the previous year and with whom he was sexually 
active shortly after his return, developed symptoms. In both 
patients, the results of serological analyses of acute- and con-
valescent-phase paired sera were consistent with ZIKV infec-
tion; however, efforts to detect ZIKV nucleic acid (RNA) and to 
isolate virus from sera were unsuccessful. Competent mosquito 
vectors for ZIKV have not been detected in the geographic 
region of residence of the scientist and his wife, and were absent

around their home upon specific investigation. Further evi-
dence for the potential for sexual transmission was provided by 
the detection of a high ZIKV RNA load and isolation of cultured 
virus from semen samples of a patient also exhibiting hemato-
spermia during an outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013 [43].
In 2016 early in the course of the outbreak in the Americas, 
experiences with travelers returning from areas of active trans-
mission to North America and Europe confirmed sexual con-
tact as a mode of transmission. As of 18 April 2017, 46 cases of 
sexually acquired Zika virus disease have been reported in the 
United States to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC). While the vast majority of these transmissions occurred 
from symptomatic men to women, cases of male-to-male [44], 
female-to-male [45], and asymptomatic male-to-female trans-
mission [46, 47] have also been documented. These findings 
spurred efforts to determine the frequency and duration (ie, 
persistence) of ZIKV shedding in genital fluids and especially 
semen, the risk of transmission through sexual contact, and 
the potential for ongoing Zika virus transmission sustained 
through sexual transmission.
Current CDC and World Health Organization (WHO) guid-
ance recommends that men, regardless of presence or absence 
of ZIKV-compatible symptoms, wait at least 6 months follow-
ing ZIKV exposure before cessation of barrier-protected sexual 
intercourse [48]. The CDC similarly recommends that women 
wait at least 8 weeks following ZIKV exposure. At this time, 
no cases of adverse outcome following periconceptual sexual 
transmission of ZIKV have been documented and all known 
cases of male-to-female sexual transmission would have been 
prevented by adherence to this guidance, but ongoing surveil-
lance and further investigation are essential. Simple mathemati-
cal models suggest that sexual transmission of ZIKV is unlikely 
to be sustained in areas without ongoing mosquito-borne trans-
mission [49].
Biology and Pathophysiology
The presence of potentially infectious ZIKV in human semen 
has been assessed in 2 ways: by the presence of ZIKV RNA 
detectable by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR) and by the demonstration of virus by passage ampli-
fication in culture. Assessing persistence of virus by the pres-
ence of ZIKV RNA is unreliable as the presence of RNA may not 
necessarily represent the presence of infectious virus. The lon-
gest published time point after onset of illness that ZIKV RNA 
has been detected in semen has been reported to be 188 days 
[50]; unpublished data from individual case reports indicate 
even longer periods of detectability on very rare occasions. A 
study with serial specimen collection from 55 men from Puerto 
Rico who had laboratory-confirmed infection found that semen 
RNA concentrations in general declined steadily after illness 
onset. Among the 24 (44%) men with ZIKV RNA detected in 
any semen sample, the estimated median time until loss of RNA 
detection in semen was 34 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 
28–41 days); by 81 days (95% CI, 64–98 days), the likelihood of 
detecting ZIKV RNA was only 5% [51]. The longest published 
time point after onset of illness that ZIKV was possibly cultur-
able from semen was 69 days [52]; however, methodological 
issues make generalizing from this single report difficult. ZIKV 
RNA was detected in two cell culture samples 5–7 days after 
inoculation, but no data were reported on changes in ZIKV 
RNA copy number in the inocula vs in the supernatant of the 
cell culture passage such as by cytopathic effect, plaque forma-
tion, or serial transfer of infectious material. Other publications 
have reported culturing virus up to 24 days [43, 53–55] after 
illness onset.
It is unclear which semen component(s) contain infectious 
virus; however, ZIKV RNA has been detected in the semen of 
men without spermatocytes due to vasectomy [52] and azo-
ospermia [47] and in semen from which spermatocytes have 
been removed by centrifugation [56]. However, ZIKV antigens 
have also been visualized within the head of spermatocytes by 
immunofluorescent staining [57] of a ZIKV-infected man, and 
ZIKV RNA has been detected directly by in situ hybridization 
in the head and flagella of spermatocytes from inoculated mice 
[58].
Data from experimental inoculation of adult type I and type 
II interferon receptor deficient (AG129) mice with an Asian 
ZIKV genotype isolated during the current Western hemi-
sphere outbreak demonstrated a 75% (95% CI, 53%–89%; 
15/20 males) seminal shedding rate of viable virus between 7 
and 21 days postinoculation (dpi). Mean peak titers in semen 
from nonvasectomized male mice were 3.8 log10 plaque-form-
ing units (PFU)/ejaculate (maximum: 5.6 log10) [59]. Infected 
male AG129 mice demonstrated a 50% sexual transmission rate 
to AG129 female mice at 7–19 days dpi as evidenced by iso-
lation of virus from the brains of symptomatic mated females. 
Overall, 73% of male mice (8/11) were responsible for at least 
1 sexual transmission event. Zika viral RNA was detected in 
semen through 56 dpi despite the last observation of infectious 
virus at 21 dpi, indicating prolonged RNA shedding in mouse 
seminal fluid following cessation of detection of infectious virus 
by plaque assay. Eight vasectomized AG129 mice were assessed 
for viral shedding and sexual transmission potential. In contrast 
to data generated from nonvasectomized mice, virus was only 
detected in 2 samples of seminal fluids. Titers of ZIKV in these 
2 seminal samples were significantly lower (<2.2 log10 PFU/
ejaculate); nevertheless, 2 of 7 (29%) matings of susceptible 
AG129 females that occurred within 24 hours of these 2 ZIKV-
positive surrogate samplings resulted in symptomatic infections 
of mated female AG129 mice. Published data on semen from 
NHPs are limited to assessment of ZIKV RNA in seminal flu-
ids of five rhesus macaques inoculated with a Thai ZIKV isolate 
[60]. These data demonstrated the presence of viral RNA at dpi 
7 through 28 and observed increased ZIKV RNA copy numbers

in subsequent inoculated culture from semen obtained at dpi 
7 and 14, providing an indication of the presence of infectious 
virus.
No human data exist on the infectious dose required for 
sexual transmission of ZIKV. Direct intravaginal inoculation 
of pregnant AG129 mice with 1000 PFU resulted in a 60% 
symptomatic infection rate. In contrast, 22% of nonpregnant 
females given the same intravaginal dose were infected [59]. 
In this mouse model of sexual transmission, levels of virus as 
low as 40–160 PFU per ejaculate (approximately 3–4 log10 RNA 
copies) resulted in sexual transmission [59]. Peak ZIKV titers 
in vasectomized male mice were significantly lower than titers 
observed in nonvasectomized males but did not translate to a 
statistically lower transmission rate in this study. Additional 
intravaginal mouse model development studies have demon-
strated that intravaginal susceptibility is dependent upon the 
estrus status of the female mouse and that hormonal fluctua-
tions can alter expression of putative ZIKV receptors on the 
surface of vaginal mucosal cells [61, 62]. Human data on the 
correlation between RNA copy and the presence of infectious 
virus in semen is limited, and this relationship likely varies 
between individuals and at different time periods after symp-
tom onset. Absent this data and an understanding of the factors 
associated with female intravaginal susceptibility, it is not pos-
sible to make assessments of transmission risk for an individual 
person or couple.
Regarding women, data from case reports and from female 
participants in the Puerto Rican serial specimen study indicate 
that shedding of detectable ZIKV RNA in vaginal secretions 
is uncommon and limited in duration (usually <14 days) [51, 
63–66]. Mouse models suggest that that vaginal shedding could 
be affected by the timing within the estrus/menstrual cycle [61] 
as well as pregnancy status [59]; however, inoculated female 
AG129 mice failed to demonstrate sexual transmission to male 
mice. Given that the one suspected case of female-to-male sex-
ual transmission occurred in a period at the onset of the wom-
an’s menses, and mice do not shed their endometrial layer in a 
similar manner, this mouse model is likely not directly applica-
ble to female-to-male human transmission potential.
Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions
In areas with widespread ongoing mosquito-borne transmis-
sion, assessing the contribution of sexual transmission to all 
ZIKV infections is exceptionally challenging. It is unknown how 
the per-act risk of sexual transmission from infected men com-
pares to the per-bite risk of an infected mosquito or if infection 
through sexual contact confers any different risk for fetal injury 
than vector-borne infection. Studies investigating differential 
viral RNA signatures or vaginal secretory immune responses of 
women known to be infected by mosquito bite vs sexually could 
be useful in further characterizing the subsequent pathogenesis 
of alternative routes of infection.
INTRAUTERINE AND INTRAPARTUM 
TRANSMISSION
Epidemiology
Maternal ZIKV infection has been associated with adverse fetal 
and infant outcomes, including microcephaly, brain abnormali-
ties, and visual and hearing deficits [67–72]; however, the poten-
tially devastating effects following maternal infection during 
pregnancy have only been recently reported. Intrapartum trans-
mission of ZIKV has been reported; however, the precise mech-
anism is unknown [73]. ZIKV has been demonstrated in vaginal 
secretions [74] and female-to-male sexual transmission has been 
reported [45]. Thus, it is conceivable that vertical transmission 
can occur through contact of infant mucosal membranes with 
ZIKV in blood and vaginal secretions during the birth process.
Biology and Pathophysiology
The precise pathogenesis of congenital transmission remains 
poorly understood. Human and animal studies indicate that 
the placenta and fetus are at risk for infection via transplacen-
tal transmission [59, 75–85]. Sexual transmission and ascend-
ing vaginal infection leading to congenital ZIKV infection have 
been demonstrated in a mouse study [85]. Most of the focus 
to date has been on the transplacental maternofetal transmis-
sion of Zika virus. The placenta plays a major role in prevent-
ing transmission of pathogens, acting as a physical barrier and 
through the innate and adaptive maternal immune response 
[86]. However, these protective features do not prevent all infec-
tions from reaching the fetus. As seen with other congenital 
infections such as Toxoplasma gondii and cytomegalovirus [87, 
88], pathogens can bypass the physical and immune functions 
of the placenta and be transferred from maternal tissues to the 
fetus. Human and animal studies have explored mechanisms by 
which ZIKV may cause fetal infection, as well as the mecha-
nisms responsible for adverse sequelae observed among infants 
with congenital ZIKV infection [59, 75–85].
Examination of the architecture of the placenta may yield 
important insight into possible mechanisms contributing to 
placental and fetal infection. A mature placenta weighs approx-
imately 500 g and is comprised of the chorionic plate, the sur-
face that faces the fetus, and the basal plate, which is in contact 
with the maternal endometrium or decidua [86]. Between 
these chorionic and basal plates is the intervillous space where 
thousands of fetally derived villi are bathed in maternal blood 
originating from maternally derived spiral arteries. Each fetal 
villus originates from the chorionic plate and is covered by a 
trophoblast cell layer consisting of syncytiotrophoblasts (STBs), 
subsyncytial cytotrophoblasts (CTBs), and a basement mem-
brane. The villi are highly vascularized by fetal capillaries allow-
ing for the exchange of oxygen and nutrients. Also, within the 
villi are Hofbauer cells (HBCs), highly vacuolated macrophages 
located in close proximity to fetal capillaries [80]. For trans-
placental transmission from the maternal to the fetal blood to

occur, ZIKV must somehow cross these multiple cellular layers 
or perhaps be transported. Some studies indicate that STBs are 
resistant to ZIKV replication [89]; however, other reports indi-
cate that because ZIKV infection triggers vascular damage and 
apoptosis, the placenta may become more permeable [78, 82, 
83], facilitating entry into CTBs [78, 81, 83]. Entry of ZIKV into 
the CTBs could result in propagation of infection into the villus 
stroma and infection of HBCs.
Once in the placenta, ZIKV has been shown to replicate in 
various cell types, including macrophages and fetal endothe-
lial cells [76, 78–80]. ZIKV has been shown to infect HBCs 
in isolated cultures and placental explants. Given the location 
of HBCs within the villi, these cells can serve as a reservoir 
of ZIKV and disseminate ZIKV into fetal blood. Detection of 
ZIKV RNA in the chorionic plate, specifically within the HBCs 
and histiocytes in the intervillous spaces, has been observed 
in placental specimens from pregnancies with maternal ZIKV 
infections [75, 90].
Similar to other flaviviruses, studies indicate that Tyro3, Axl, 
Mert (TAM) receptors, members of the tyrosine kinase family, 
may play a role in promoting ZIKV entry into placental cells 
[79, 91]. Axl is expressed in several cell types present at the 
maternofetal interface that are known to be susceptible to ZIKV 
infection, including trophoblasts, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, 
and HBCs. In addition, TAM receptors, once activated can 
dampen the innate immune response, and inhibit type I inter-
feron, which can block its antiviral effects [84]. TIM1, a member 
of the T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain protein family 
that regulates innate and adaptive immune functions and cell 
survival, has also been suggested as an important entry co-fac-
tor, facilitating entry of ZIKV into placental cells.
Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions
While much has been learned about ZIKV over the past year, 
many questions remain about the pathophysiology of matern-
ofetal transmission. Future research should include an empha-
sis on studying the basic science of maternofetal transmission, 
differences in frequency of transmission based on gestational 
timing of infection, and correlation of maternal serum ZIKV 
viral load with the risk of infection. Additional research could 
greatly inform the understanding of risk associated with ZIKV 
infection during pregnancy and could provide insight into the 
relationship between fetal infection and adverse outcomes. 
Given the absence of histopathological findings in placental 
tissues where ZIKV is detected by RT-PCR [92], further exam-
ination of and elucidation of placental pathology may improve 
understanding on the mechanism of placental infection and of 
maternofetal transmission.
BLOOD 
TRANSFUSION
Investigations in Brazil have detected 3 probable transmis-
sions of ZIKV associated with platelet transfusion, although 
mosquito-borne transmission could not be definitively ruled 
out in these cases and none of the recipients experienced clini-
cal disease [93, 94]. Transmission of flaviviruses closely related 
to ZIKV, such as dengue virus, yellow fever vaccine virus, and 
West Nile virus (WNV), via blood product transfusion has been 
well documented. Following confirmation of 23 WNV infec-
tions from transfusion of blood products in the United States in 
2002 [95], universal screening of blood products in the United 
States by a sensitive nucleic acid test (NAT) has been routinely 
performed. In addition, ZIKV RNA has been detected in 2.8% 
(42/1505) of asymptomatic blood donors by reverse-transcrip-
tion polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) during the 2013–
2014 ZIKV outbreak in French Polynesia [96].
Prevention of transmission of ZIKV requires either patho-
gen reduction of blood products or identification of potentially 
infectious blood products through laboratory screening and 
removal of those products from distribution. Pathogen reduc-
tion technology (PRT) has been demonstrated to be effective 
in inactivating ZIKV for both platelet and plasma [97] and red 
blood cell components [98]; however, PRT is currently only US 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved for plasma 
and apheresis platelets. The FDA issued updated guidance for 
industry to reduce the risk of transfusion-related transmission 
of ZIKV in August 2016 [99]. The new recommendations call 
for blood collection establishments in all states and US terri-
tories to screen individual units of donated whole blood and 
blood components with a ZIKV screening test authorized for 
use by FDA under an investigational new drug (IND) applica-
tion, or with a licensed test when available. Alternatively, PRT 
may be used for plasma and certain platelet products.
Following identification of local transmission of ZIKV in 
Puerto Rico in December 2015, initial efforts to protect the 
safety of the blood supply involved the importation of blood 
products from unaffected areas in the continental United States 
and treatment of plasma and apheresis platelets with PRT, 
facilitated by the Department of Health and Human Services. 
Starting in early April 2016, individual donor screening for 
ZIKV by NAT under an IND authorization was implemented. 
By June 2016, 2 blood screening NATs were available under 
IND applications in the United States. During the peak of the 
outbreak, 1.8% of donated blood products in Puerto Rico had 
detectable ZIKV nucleic acid [100, 101]. To date, 325 presump-
tive viremic donors in Puerto Rico have been identified [102].
Since the availability of NAT screening assays under IND, 
219 blood presumptive viremic donors in the continental 
United States and Hawaii have been identified. The first 14 
probable ZIKV infections identified in blood donors from the 
continental United States were described in detail by Galel and 
colleagues [103]. All probable infected donations were collected

14 had anti-Zika IgM antibody present. The infectious dose of 
ZIKV necessary for transmission via transfusion and the effect 
of antibody on transmissibility are currently unknown.
LABORATORY EXPOSURE
One of the earliest documented human infections with ZIKV 
occurred in 1963 in an individual working in a Ugandan labora-
tory with a strain isolated from Ae. africanus mosquitoes [104]. 
However the location and route of transmission could not be 
definitively determined in this case as mosquito exposure was 
also present. In 1973, ZIKV was again isolated from a blood 
sample from a laboratorian working with arboviruses, this time 
in the absence of a potential vector-borne route of transmission 
[105]. In 1980, the American Committee on Arthropod-Borne 
Viruses reported, without details, 3 additional suspected labo-
ratory-acquired ZIKV infections identified through global labo-
ratory safety surveys conducted in 1976 and 1979 [106]. During 
the current outbreak, a laboratorian in Pennsylvania developed 
a symptomatic laboratory-confirmed ZIKV infection following 
a needle-stick injury in the absence of other apparent routes of 
transmission [107]. BSL-2 practices, containment equipment, 
and facilities are recommended for activities with human diag-
nostic specimens [108].
ORGAN AND 
TISSUE 
TRANSPLANTATION AND 
OTHER POTENTIAL ROUTES OF 
TRANSMISSION
Transmission of ZIKV by organ transplantation has not yet been 
documented, but concern exists based on previous documented 
transmission of WNV through solid organ transplantation and 
the often immunosuppressed status of transplant recipients. 
Testing of donor serum for WNV has had limited utility in 
excluding the risk for transplantation transmission with 50% of 
the 8 organ donors associated with virus transmission having 
negative NAT results prior to organ recovery [109]. The risk for 
ZIKV transmission through organ transplantation is unknown, 
but plausible. The Organ Procurement and Transplantation 
(OPTN) and United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) have 
put out guidance on considerations for evaluating potential 
organ donors given this potential risk [110, 111]. Data on out-
comes of ZIKV infection in solid organ transplant recipients 
are currently limited to a small number of case reports from 
non-transplant-associated infections [112, 113].
Transmission via tissue transplantation has never been 
demonstrated for any flavivirus, but WNV RNA was identified 
in skin, fat, muscle, tendon, and bone marrow from a deceased 
donor who was associated with WNV transmission through 
solid organ transplantation [114]. However, WNV could not 
be cultured from the RNA-positive tissues. Concern exists for 
ZIKV due to prolonged RNA detection in reproductive and 
eye tissues and the lack of processing for certain tissue types, 
including semen. Donor deferral recommendations have there-
fore been issued by FDA for both living and cadaveric donors 
[115], but the use of donor screening tests have not been recom-
mended to date, in part due to an absence of data on the perfor-
mance of available assays for this purpose and specimen type.
OTHER POTENTIAL ROUTES
Nucleic acid from flaviviruses including dengue virus and 
WNV have been detected in breast milk, but cases of confirmed 
or probable transmission events from breastfeeding appear to 
be very rare [116, 117]. Recent case reports have identified at 
least 9 lactating mothers with ZIKV RNA detected in breast 
milk samples, 3 of which had infectious viral particles as evi-
denced by culture [73, 118–121]. Two of the mothers without 
cultured virus had infants with evidence of ZIKV infection. In 
neither of these cases were the data sufficient to establish the 
route of infection for the newborn. In an additional case, com-
plete genome sequences that differed only by two synonymous 
nucleotide substitutions were obtained from maternal breast 
milk and the urine of her 5-month-old breastfeeding infant 
[121]. After careful review of the available evidence, WHO and 
CDC concluded that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any 
potential risk [122].
ZIKV RNA has been detected on multiple occasions in a 
variety of other bodily specimens including urine, saliva, amni-
otic fluid, female genital tract secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, 
aqueous humor, conjunctival fluid, and nasopharyngeal swabs 
[64, 123–128]. Infectious viral particles have been documented 
occasionally in some of these specimens, but have not been 
linked to transmission events to date, with the possible excep-
tion of 1 case of female-to-male sexual transmission [45]. A case 
of locally acquired ZIKV infection in an area without com-
petent mosquito vectors was extensively investigated without 
identification of the probable source of infection or additional 
transmission events [129]. The index patient in this instance 
had a viral load that was approximately 100 000 times that of 
the average ZIKV infection. The case patient reported hugging 
and kissing the index patient in a similar fashion to other family 
contacts, and assisted hospital personnel in holding the index 
patient as he was being cleaned, but did not have direct con-
tact with body fluids. No other infections in family contacts or 
healthcare workers could be identified, suggesting an unknown, 
but rare, person-to-person transmission event. These findings 
reinforce the continued need for healthcare workers to follow 
standard precautions when handling body fluids from patients.
CONCLUSIONS
While mosquito-borne transmission still appears to account 
for the vast majority of ZIKV infections globally, the recent 
large outbreaks of the disease have identified several addi-
tional routes of transmission for this virus. These multiple 
possible routes of transmission have considerably increased 
the complexity of responding to the ongoing outbreak. Public 
health prevention efforts have needed to expand beyond the

traditional cornerstone of vector control for arthropod-borne 
diseases to encompass strategies to prevent blood-borne, con-
genital, and sexual transmission. Additional research is urgently 
needed to develop interventions to mitigate non-vector borne 
ZIKV transmission. This includes information on what addi-
tional routes of transmission can occur, the risk of various fluids 
to transmit ZIKV, the relative risk for each mode of transmis-
sion, and the potential pathogenesis following each potential 
mode of transmission.
