Background: The potential for cross acclimation between environmental stressors is
not well understood. Thus, the aim of this investigation was to determine the effect of
fixed-workload heat or hypoxic acclimation on cellular, physiological, and performance
responses during post acclimation hypoxic exercise in humans.
Method: Twenty-one males (age 22 ± 5 years; stature 1.76 ± 0.07 m; mass 71.8 ±
7.9 kg; V
˙O peak 51
7 mL.kg−1.

and self-paced 16.1 km time trial (TT) before (HST1, TT1), and after (HST2, TT2) a series
of 10 daily 60 min training sessions (50% N V
˙O2 peak) in control (CON, n = 7; 18◦C,
35% RH), hypoxic (HYP
, n
◦
= 7; fraction of inspired oxygen = 0.14, 18 C, 35% RH), or
hot (HOT, n = 7; 40◦C, 25% RH) conditions.
Results: TT performance in hypoxia was improved following both acclimation
treatments, HYP (−3:16 ± 3:10 min:s; p = 0.0006) and HOT (−2:02 ± 1:02 min:s;
p = 0.005), but unchanged after CON (+0:31 ± 1:42 min:s). Resting monocyte heat
shock protein 72 (mHSP72) increased prior to HST2 in HOT (62 ± 46%) and HYP (58 ±
52%), but was unchanged after CON (9 ± 46%), leading to an attenuated mHSP72
response to hypoxic exercise in HOT and HYP HST2 compared to HST1 (p < 0.01).
Changes in extracellular hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α followed a similar pattern to those
of mHSP72. Physiological strain index (PSI) was attenuated in HOT (HST1 = 4.12 ±
0.58, HST2 = 3.60 ± 0.42; p = 0.007) as a result of a reduced HR (HST1 = 140 ±
14 b.min−1; HST2 131 ± 9 b.min−1 p = 0.0006) and Trectal (HST1 = 37.55
◦
± 0.18 C;
HST2 37.45 ± 0.14◦C; p = 0.018) during exercise. Whereas PSI did not change in HYP
(HST1 = 4.82 ± 0.64, HST2 4.83 ± 0.63).
Conclusion: Heat acclimation improved cellular and systemic physiological tolerance to
steady state exercise in moderate hypoxia. Additionally we show, for the first time, that
heat acclimation improved cycling time trial performance to a magnitude similar to that
achieved by hypoxic acclimation.

Heat Acclimation Improves Hypoxic Tolerance
INTRODUCTION
Adaptation to one environmental stressor can induce protective
responses upon exposure to other stressors as long as they share
common adaptive responses (Fregly, 2011). This phenomenon is
termed cross-acclimation, when physiological strain is attenuated
(Ely et al., 2014), or cross-tolerance, when improved cellular
protection is observed (Kregel, 2002). At a cellular level acute
heat (Fehrenbach et al., 2001; Lee et al., 2014; Périard et al., 2015)
and hypoxic stress (Taylor et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2014) induce the
heat shock response (HSR; Morimoto, 1998), characterized by a
transient post exposure increase in the cytoprotective heat shock
protein 72 (HSP72). Additionally, acclimation to either heat or
hypoxia induces phenotypic alterations that increased expression
of genes encoding for cytoprotective HSPs (Maloyan et al., 1999;
Mcclung et al., 2008; Gibson et al., 2015c), leading to greater
cellular resilience in the face of subsequent stressful insults (Levi
et al., 1993; Hutter et al., 1994).
Enhanced HSP72 following heat acclimation is associated
with delayed tissue injury during acute heat stress (Horowitz
et al., 2004) and contributes to cross tolerance between heat
and ischemic stressors (Maloyan et al., 1999). In humans
supplemented with quercetin—a potent inhibitor of the heat
shock response, post heat acclimation thermotolerance was
reduced (Kuennen et al., 2011). This was characterized by
a diminished cellular stress marker response alongside an
attenuated physiological adaptation, illustrating the functional
role of the HSR at a whole body level. However, Hom et al.
(2012) demonstrated a heat acclimated phenotype in the absence
of HSP72 elevation, suggesting that increased HSP72 alone
may not always be present in heat acclimation. In rodent
models, increased hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF1-α), the
master regulator of oxygen-regulated genes, and downstream
indicators of HIF-1α expression such as erythropoietin (EPO)
receptor, EPO, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
have been observed after acute heat stress (Na’ama et al., 2005)
and heat acclimation (Maloyan et al., 2005; Tetievsky et al.,
2008; Assayag et al., 2012; Umschweif et al., 2013) suggesting
an interaction between HIF-1α and the HSR during heat
acclimation.
Few
studies
have
investigated
the
potential
for
heat
acclimation to confer cross acclimation and tolerance to acute
hypoxic exposures in a human model (Heled et al., 2012; Lee
et al., 2014, 2015; Gibson et al., 2015c), with no study examining
the response ofHIF1-α to a heat acclimation regimen. Both acute
exercising exposures to heat and heat combined with hypoxia
have been shown to attenuate physiological strain during hypoxic
exercise conducted 24 h following the initial heat exposure (Lee
et al., 2014). The same authors also observed reduced exercise
heart rates and rectal temperatures, and increased exercise SpO2
during hypoxic exercise that was preceded by 3 days of heat
acclimation (Lee et al., 2015). Longer term heat acclimation
programs have also led to a reduction in hypoxic exercise
HR alongside increased SpO2 (Heled et al., 2012; Gibson
et al., 2015c), and an improved cardiac efficiency ( ˙
VO2/HR
referred to as O2 pulse; Gibson et al., 2015c). In addition to the
improvements seen in systemic function, an increase in resting
peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) HSP72 protein (Lee
et al., 2014, 2015) and HSP72 mRNA (Gibson et al., 2015c) have
been observed following heat acclimation. Subsequently, the
post hypoxic exercise induced increases in the HSP72 response
have been shown to be attenuated in heat-acclimated individuals
(Lee et al., 2015; Gibson et al., 2015c). These data support
the existence of both cross-acclimation and cross-tolerance in
humans.
While each of these studies included matched load control
groups (Lee et al., 2015; Gibson et al., 2015c), no study has
examined cross-acclimation and cross-tolerance in relation to
a matched period of hypoxic acclimation. Neither has the
effect of heat acclimation on hypoxic exercise performance been
determined. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to
compare the impact of a period of heat acclimation vs. hypoxic
acclimation on physiological cross-acclimation and cellular
cross-tolerance, and exercise performance during a subsequent
exposure to acute normobaric hypoxia. It was hypothesized that
a prior period of either heat or hypoxic acclimation would
reduce physiological strain and improve physical performance
when exercising in moderate normobaric hypoxia, with the
effects being greatest following hypoxic acclimation. It was also
hypothesized that both heat and hypoxic acclimation would
increase resting levels of both mHSP72 and eHIF-1α post
acclimation.
METHODS
Participant Characteristics
Participants (n
=
21 males; Figure 1) provided written
informed consent to take part in the study, which was approved
by the Coventry University Ethics review panel. Established
confounding variables of smoking, caffeine, glutamine, quercetin,
alcohol, and prior thermal, hypoxic and hyperbaric exposures
were all controlled in line with previous work (Taylor et al., 2011;
Gibson et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2014, 2015). Participants were asked
not to undertake any other exercise training in the 72 h leading
up to a testing bout and throughout the intervention period. All
data collection was conducted in accordance with the standards
set out in the Declaration of Helsinki of 1996.
Experimental Design
All participants attended the laboratory on 17 separate occasions,
as outlined in Figure 1. Two preliminary visits enabled height,
body mass, estimated body fat via skinfold measurements, and
normoxic (N) and hypoxic (H) ˙
VO2 peak tests, separated by at
least 5 days, to be conducted. Thereafter participants were split
into three experimental groups (control, CON; heat acclimation,
HOT; hypoxic acclimation, HYP) that were matched for H ˙
VO2
peak and training experience (Figure 1). After both N and H
˙
VO2 peak tests had been conducted all participants undertook
two hypoxic stress test (HST) familiarization (FAM) sessions
(described below) at least 4 days apart (Lee et al., 2014, 2015). To
avoid any confounding acclimation to acute hypoxia FAM was
conducted under normoxic conditions. At least 7 days after the
final FAM session participants completed the first HST.

which specific tests were undertaken.
Preliminary Visit Measurements
Height was measured in the Frankfurt plane using a Harpenden
stadiometer (Harpenden Instruments, Burgess Hill, UK), nude
body mass determined on an electronic scale (Seca Body,
Cranlea and Company, Birmingham, UK) and sum of skinfolds
determined from four sites using a skinfold caliper (Harpenden
Instruments, Burgess Hill, UK) as described by Durnin and
Womersley (1974).
Peak ˙
VO2 was determined in both N and H conditions
on separate days (preliminary visits 1 and 2) using an
incremental exercise test to volitional exhaustion on a calibrated
SRM cycle ergometer (Schoberer Rad Meßtechnik, Welldorf,
Germany). Hypoxia was generated via a Hypoxicator unit
(Hypoxico HYP123 Hypoxicator, New York, USA), that was
used to fill a reservoir of three 1000 L Douglas bags in
series. Participants inspired via a mouthpiece attached to a
two-way non-rebreathable valve (Harvard Ltd., Eldenbridge,
UK) connected to the gas reservoir with clear ethylene vinyl
tubing.
Resting blood lactate (BLa; Biosen C-Line analyser, EKF
Diagnostics, Sailauf, Germany) was determined from a finger
capillary whole blood sample following a 10-min seated rest
period. The test began at a workload of 70 W for 4 min and was
then increased by 35 W every 4 min until a blood lactate value
of >4 mmol·L−1 was reached. Thereafter, workload increased
35 W every 2 min until volitional exhaustion. A cadence of
70 rev·min−1 was maintained throughout. Expired gases were
collected using 200 L Douglas bags (Cranlea & Co, Birmingham,
UK) during the final minute of each stage. Heart rate (Polar
FT1, Polar Electro OY, Kempele, Finland) and perceived exertion
(Borg, 1982) were recorded at the end of each gas collection.
Respiratory gas analysis was completed as previously described
(Lee et al., 2014, 2015).
Familiarization, Hypoxic Stress Testing
(HST), and Acclimation Procedures
On each FAM and HST session, as well as throughout the
acclimation period, participants reported to the laboratory after
an overnight fast to consume a set breakfast 2 h prior to the
exercise bout. The energy content of the breakfast was 386 kcal,
made up of 15.6 g protein, 44.4 g carbohydrate and 16.4 g fat.
Participants drank 400 ml of water with the breakfast.
Each FAM, HST and acclimation session was preceded by
15 min of seated normoxic rest (after instrumentation) to collect
baseline data and an additional 15 min of seated rest within the
defined environment (N or H). The FAM and HST sessions
consisted of 40 min of cycle exercise at 50% N ˙
VO2 peak, a 5 min
recovery in which instruments were removed from participants,
followed by a 16.1 km cycling time trial. The time trial has a CV
and TEM of 0.63% and 36 s, respectively, following two FAM
sessions. The smallest worthwhile change in TT time using this
protocol is therefore a 46 s difference (Lee et al., 2015). The 10-
day acclimation protocol consisted of once daily exposures of
cycle ergometer exercise within the defined environment, either
CON (18◦C, 35% RH), HOT (40◦C, 25% RH), or HYP (18◦C,
35% RH, FIO2 = 0.14%) at 50% N ˙
VO2 peak for 60 min (Castle
et al., 2011).
Physiological Measurements
Prior to each testing session participants provided a urine
sample for the assessment of urine specific gravity (USG;
Atago Refractomer, Jencons Pls, Leighton Buzzard, UK) and
urine osmolality (UOSMO; Advanced 3300 Micro-Osmometer,
Advanced Inc., Massachusetts, USA), determined their nude
body mass (Seca, Bodycare, UK) and inserted a rectal thermistor
(Grant Instruments, UK) to a depth of 10 cm. Heart rate (HR)
was monitored throughout each trial via telemetry (Suunto, T6c,

Finland). Blood lactate (Biosen C-Line analyser, EKF Diagnostics,
Sailauf, Germany) was determined from a finger capillary whole
blood sample at the end of the resting period and at the end of
exercise for both HST and acclimation sessions. Heat strain was
calculated using the physiological strain index (PSI; (Moran et al.,
1998) as follows:
PSI = 5(TrectalT − Trectal0) × (39.5 − Trectal0)−1 + 5(HRT −
HR0) × (180 − HR0)−1
Where Trectal0 and HR0 are the initial Trectal and heart rate
respectively, and TrectalT and HRT were obtained at 10 min
intervals during acclimation sessions or HST with the mean
exercise value reported, and at each 1 km measurement point
throughout the TT. The PSI classifies physiological strain
between 0 and 10 units, where 0 represents no or very little strain
and 10 represents very high strain (Moran et al., 1998).
During all hypoxic sessions, arterial oxygen hemoglobin
saturation (SPO2) was measured throughout via a pulse
oximeter (WristOx, Nonin Medical Inc., Minnesota, USA).
Hemodynamic indices of stroke volume (SV) and cardiac
output ( ˙
Q) were estimated via arterial waveform measurements
obtained from a pneumatic finger cuff attached to the index
finger of the right hand (Portapres Model-2, Finapres Medical
Systems, Hogehilweg, Amsterdam). The right arm was supported
throughout using a sling, and the index finger positioned at a
height equivalent to the aorta via palpation of the third intercostal
space. Measurements were taken at the end of each resting
phase, and for 120 s every 10 min during the exercise phase, and
Portapres calibrations performed at the beginning of the rest
period and at 8 min intervals throughout the HST. Ratings of
perceived exertion (RPE; Borg, 1982) and thermal sensation (TS)
were collected at 10 min intervals during the 40 min exercise
tolerance phase of the test session with the mean exercise value
reported.
The self-paced 16.1 km time trial was completed using
the SRMwin software’s open-ended mode (Version 6.4.2).
Participants were instructed to complete the course as quickly as
possible and were given no verbal encouragement during the TT.
Participants were only able to see the distance they had covered.
Measures of HR, SpO2, Trectal, and power output were collected
every kilometer and a fingertip BLa sample collected immediately
upon completion of the TT.
Blood Sampling
Venous blood samples (∼7 mL) were collected from an
antecubital vein into an EDTA treated vacutainer (Vacuetter,
Greiner Bio-One, Stonehouse, UK) following the 15 min seated
stabilization period before each HST, and on day 1 and 10 of
the acclimation period. Post exercise samples were collected
immediately after the exercise phase of the 60 min HST
exposure was completed, and immediately upon completion
of the aforementioned acclimation sessions. Whole venous
blood was used to determine hemoglobin via a calibrated B-
Hemoglobin Photometer (Hemocue Ltd., Angleholm, Sweden)
and heparinized capillary sample tubes were centrifuged
(Hawksley Micro Hematocrit Centrifuge, Hawksley and Son,
Lancing, UK) to establish hematocrit using a micro hematocrit
reader (Hawksley Micro). Both hemoglobin and hematocrit were
assessed in triplicate with the mean value reported. These samples
were collected to calculate corrected plasma volumes according
to the equations of Dill and Costill (1974). A 100 µL aliquot
was used for the immediate assessment of monocyte HSP72
(mHSP72; described below). The remaining whole blood was
centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min and plasma aliquots stored
at −80◦C until assessment of plasma glucose and lactate (Randox
Daytona Rx, County Antrim, Ireland), and extracellular HIF-1α
(eHIF-1α; Cusabio, BIOTEK, Newark, New Jersey).
mHSP72 Determination
An IgG1 isotype and concentration-matched FITC-conjugated
negative control were used in order to assess non-specific
binding. Briefly, cells obtained after red cell lysis were fixed and
permeabilised (AbD Serotec, Kidlington, UK) and a negative
control (FITC, AbD Serotec, Kidlington, UK) or anti-HSP72
antibody (SPA-810, Enzo lifesciences, Exeter, UK) was added
to a final concentration of 100 µg·ml−1, this was used to label
1 × 106 cells according to the manufacturer’s instructions
and then incubated for 30 min in the dark. Samples were
then analyzed on a BD FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences, Oxford,
UK) by flow cytometry with monocytes gated for forward/side
scatter properties and further discriminated by CD14 expression
(Selkirk et al., 2009). Mean florescence intensity (MFI) was then
calculated using CellQuest Pro software (BD Biosciences, Oxford,
UK) with a total of 15000 cells counted.
Extracellular HIF-1α
Extracellular HIF-1α, in EDTA plasma, was measured using
a pre-prepared sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) technique (Cusabio BIOTEK, Newark, New Jersey).
100 µL of standards and samples were added to each pre-coated
well and incubated for 2 h at 37◦C. Standards and samples were
then aspirated and 100 µL of biotin-antibody and incubated at
37◦C for 1 h. After three 200 µL washes with sodium azide-
free wash buffer, 100 µL of horse radish peroxidase-avidin was
added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37◦C. Following a
further three wash steps 90 µL of TMB substrate was added and
incubated at 37◦C in the dark before 50 µL of stop solution was
added. The plate was then read at 570 nm and 450 nm to enable
wavelength correction. The assay’s detection range is 62.5−4000
pg.mL−1 and limit of detection is 15.6 pg.mL−1. The intra-assay
precision was determined from duplicates of standards within
the same plate (6.4%) and inter-assay precision determined from
standards assessed across plates (8.2%).
Statistical Analysis
The primary outcome measures of this study were an assessment
of whole body cardiovascular, thermoregulatory, metabolic and
mHSP72, and eHIF-1α responses to the HST. Time trial
completion time was the main variable of interest during the
performance component of the HST. In order to control for the
false discovery rate and correct for multiple comparisons four
families of hypothesis were tested according to the method of
Benjamini and Hochberg (1995); (1) Physiological responses to

acclimation; (2) Physiological responses to the hypoxic stress
tests; (3) Cellular stress responses; and (4) Time trial performance
responses.
All data were checked for normal distribution prior to
analysis and tests employing repeated measures were checked for
sphericity before analysis with Mauchly’s sphericity test. Where
sphericity was broken, p-values were corrected using the Huynh-
Feldt method. Resting and mean exercise data from day 1 and day
10 of the acclimation period, and HST1 and HST2 were analyzed
using a 2 (time) × 3 (group) mixed effects linear model, with fixed
effects for acclimation day.
To enable an exploration of pacing strategies during the TT
following the acclimation period power output was averaged over
each km of the TT and analyzed using linear effects mixed models
with fixed effects for time and group. HR, Trectal and PSI during
the TT were analyzed using the same method. Data are reported
as mean ± standard deviation for n = 7 in each experimental
group, unless otherwise stated. Precise p-values are reported, and
both Cohen’s D (with 95% confidence intervals) and partial eta
squared (Pη2) effect sizes are presented to indicate the magnitude
of observed effects (Colquhoun, 2014). Cohens D effect sizes
of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 and partial eta squared (Pη2) effect sizes of
0.01, 0.06, and 0.13 are considered small, medium and large,
respectively.
RESULTS
Heat Acclimation, Hypoxic Acclimation,
and Exercise Control Interventions
Physiological
and
thermoregulatory
variables
for
each
experimental group before and after day 1 and day 10 of
acclimation are displayed in Table 1. Participants were hydrated
prior to each acclimation session, with no between-day or
between group differences observed for pre-trial body mass,
Uosmo or USG. On day 1 of acclimation, mean exercise HR was
greater in HOT (p = 0.01) and HYP (p = 0.02) compared to
CON. Additionally, HOT induced a greater mean exercise Trectal
and corresponding PSI compared to HYP (both p < 0.05) and
CON (both p < 0.001), with no difference observed between
HYP and CON (Table 1).
On day 10 of acclimation an interaction effect was observed
for resting plasma volume (f = 12.336, p < 0.0001, ηp2 = 0.58)
which increased in HOT (d = 3.8, 95% CI = 1.9 to 5.2), decreased
in HYP (d = −1.7. 95% CI = −3.2 to −0.6) and remained
unchanged in CON (d = 0.7, 95% CI = −0.5 to 1.7). No main
effect for time (f = 3.346, p = 0.084, ηp2 = 0.16) or time ×
group interaction (f = 2.293, p = 0.13, ηp2 = 0.20) was observed
for resting HR, although a large effect size was noted for HOT
(d = −0.73, 95% CI = −1.86 to 0.31). Resting Trectal was lower
following acclimation in both HYP (d = −0.72, 95% CI = −1.69
to 0.45) and HOT (d = −2.17, 95% CI = −2.3 to –0.1; p < 0.05
for both).
Following acclimation PSI was reduced in both HYP (p =
0.001, d = −1.0, 95% CI = −2.2 to 0.1) and HOT (p = 0.005,
d = −1.95, 95% CI = −3.4 to −0.8), and was unchanged in
CON (d = −0.1, 95% CI = −1.2 to 0.9). The reduction in PSI
was mediated by a lower mean exercise HR in HYP (p = 0.01,
d = −1.1, 95% CI = −2.3 to 0.0), and a lower mean exercise
HR (p = 0.04. d = −1.3, 95% CI = −2.3 to 0.0) and Trectal
(p = 0.001, d = 4.9, 95% CI = −5.0 to −1.7) in HOT. No change
in these variables was observed in CON. A large effect for rate of
Trectal change was observed for HOT (d = −1.8, 95% CI = −2.6
to –0.3) and not for CON (d = −0.3, 95% CI = −1.4 to 0.8),
or HYP (d = −0.1, 95% CI = −1.1 to 1.0), with no main effect
for time (F = 4.240, p = 0.05, ηp2 = 0.19) or group × time
interaction (f = 1.526, p = 0.244, ηp2 = 0.15) observed.
Monocyte HSP72 Before and After
Acclimation
No between group difference was observed for mHSP72 prior to
acclimation (Figure 2A).
Following exercise on day 1, mHSP72 was increased in HOT
(p = 0.0015, d = 3.8, 95% CI = 1.9 to 5.2) and HYP (p = 0.0009,
d = 1.5, 95% CI = 0.1 to 2.4), but not CON (p = 0.14, d = −0.3,
95% CI = −0.5 to 0.7; Figure 2A). An inverse relationship
between resting mHSP72 and the magnitude of after exercise
expression was observed for HOT (r = −0.88, p = 0.009), with a
weaker relationship observed for HYP (r = −0.52, p = 0.23).
Prior to day 10 of acclimation, resting mHSP72 was increased
in HOT (p = 0.0006, d = 4.1, 95% CI = 1.4 to 4.4) and
HYP (p
=
0.013, d
=
1.5, 95% CI = 0.04 to 2.3), and
unchanged in CON (p = 0.21, d = −0.4, 95% = −1.4 to 0.7;
Figure 2B). As a result of the increased resting concentrations
of mHSP72, no further after exercise changes in mHSP72 were
observed in HOT (p = 0.53) or HYP (p = 0.24) on day 10
(Figure 2B). Consequently, the before acclimation relationship
between resting mHSP72 and magnitude in after exercise change
was reduced in HOT (r = −0.05, p = 0.924), although similar in
HYP (r = −0.55, p = 0.20).
Extracellular HIF-1α Before and After
Acclimation
Figure 3 illustrates eHIF1-α concentrations before and after day
1 and day 10 of acclimation. Following exercise on day 1 of
acclimation eHIF-1α was increased in HYP (256 ± 290%, p =
0.011, d = 1.1, 95% CI = −0.2 to 2.0) and HOT (103 ± 162%,
p = 0.076, d = 0.8, 95% CI = −0.4 to 2.0), and unchanged
in CON (8 ± 29%, p = 0.95, d = 0.0, 95% = −1.1 to 1.0,

in both HYP (292 ± 360%, p = 0.02, d = 1.2, 95% CI = −0.2 to

physiological and thermoregulatory parameters are displayed in
Table 2. No resting physiological variable was affected as a result
of the intervention period (p > 0.05, Table 2). Table 3 presents
the cardiovascular, metabolic, thermoregulatory, and perceptual
responses to the HST before and after acclimation. HR was lower
in HST2 compared to HST1 in HOT (p = 0.006, d = −0.6,
95% CI = −1.8 to 0.4), and unchanged in CON (p = 0.44,
d = 0.2, 95% CI = Hypoxic Tolerance Tests 0.9 to 1.2) and
HYP (p = 0.38, d = −0.1, 95% CI = −1.1 to 1.0). Moderate
and large effects were observed for an increased SpO2 in HOT
(p = 0.0015, d = 0.70 95% CI = −0.5 to 1.8) and HYP (p = 0.023,
d = 0.50, 95% CI = −0.7 to 1.4), with no effect observed in CON
(p = 0.36 d = 0.0), neither was an interaction effect observed
(f = 1.69, p = 0.212). A moderate effect was observed for SV in
HOT (p = 0.06, d = 0.40, 95% CI = −0.7 to 1.40) but no effect
was observed for CON (p = 0.29, d = −0.1, 95% CI = −1.1
to 1.0) or HYP (p = 0.11, −0.4, 95% CI = −1.5 to 0.7), and no
interaction effect was evident (f = 2.79, p = 0.08). As a result
of the increased SV and decreased HR in HOT, and no changes
in either component variable for CON and HYP, no interaction
effect was observed for cardiac output (f = 0.50, p = 0.65),
with small effects observed for CON (d = −0.1, 95% = −1.2
to 1.0), HYP (d = −0.4, 95% CI = −1.5 to 0.7), and HOT (d
= −0.2, 95% CI = −1.3 to 0.8). Cardiac efficiency, as determined
by O2 pulse, was improved in HOT (p = 0.01, d = 0.5, 95% CI
= −0.6 to 1.5), and unchanged for CON (p = 0.50, d = 0.0,
95% CI =
−1.1 to 1.1) and HYP (p = 0.34, d = −0.1, 95%
CI = −1.12 to 0.98), although no interaction effect was observed
(f = 3.32, p = 0.059). No differences were observed between
HST1 and HST2 for ˙
VEmin, ˙
VO2, ˙
VCO2, or RER (Table 3).
An interaction effect was observed for Trectal (f = 5.58, p =
0.013), with Trectal lower during HST2 for HOT (p = 0.002,
d =
−0.6, 95% CI = −1.7 to 0.5), and unchanged for CON
(p = 0.28, d = 0.1, 95% CI = −0.9 to 1.20) and HYP (p = 0.17,
d = −0.2, 95% CI = −1.2 to 0.9). The attenuated HR and Trectal
observed in HOT resulted in a reduced PSI during HST2 (p =
0.007, d = −0.9, 95% CI = −2.1 to 0.2). PSI was unchanged
from HST1 to HST2 in CON (p = 0.30, d = −0.1, 95% CI
= −1.2 to 0.9) and HYP (p = 0.47, d = 0.02, 95% CI = −1.0
to 1.1). Additionally, the rate of Trectal change was attenuated in
HST2 following HOT (p = 0.026, d = −0.44, 95% CI = −1.4 to
0.7) but similar to HST1 in CON (p = 0.26, d = −0.1, 95% CI =
−1.1to1.0) and HYP (p = 0.49, d = −0.2, 95% CI = −1.2 to 0.9).
Monocyte HSP72 Responses to Acute
Hypoxia
Figure 4 illustrates the mHSP72 response to hypoxia before
(HST1) and after (HST2) the acclimation intervention. An acute
bout of hypoxic exercise lead to increased mHSP72 MFI in all
groups prior to acclimation (main effect for time, F = 16.65, p <
0.0001; Figure 4A), and the inverse relationship between resting
mHSP72 and post exercise mHSP72 was observed (r = −0.51,
p
=
0.019 for the combined cohort, n
=
21). Following
acclimation resting mHSP72 was increased in HYP (58 ± 52%,
p = 0.014, d = 1.2, 95% CI = −0.02 to 2.2) and HOT (63 ± 46%,
p = 0.008, d = 3.8, 95% CI = 0.7 to 3.2), remaining unchanged
in CON (10 ± 46%, p = 0.83, d = −0.1, 95% CI = −1.1 to
0.1; Figure 4B). Consequently, the mHSP72 response following
HST2 was blunted for HOT (p = 0.26) and HYP (p = 0.18), and
was comparable to HST1 in CON (Figure 4B).
Extracellular HIF-1α Responses to Acute
Hypoxia
Figure 5 illustrates the eHIF-1α response to hypoxia before
(HST1) and after (HST2) the acclimation intervention. Prior
to acclimation the HST induced a 171 ± 247%, 197 ± 125%,
and 266 ± 192% increase in eHIF-1α in CON, HYP, and HOT,
respectively (main effect for time, F = 34.59, p < 0.0001;
Figure 5A). Following the 10 day acclimation period resting
eHIF-1α was elevated in HYP (220 ± 128%, p = 0.002, d = 1.2,

HOT was attenuated compared to post exercise on day 1. (C) The magnitude

between HYP and HOT (C). Open bars and shaded bars represent pre and

95% CI = −0.2 to 2.0) and HOT (98 ± 92%, p = 0.017, d = 0.8,
95% CI = −0.4 to 1.8), and unchanged in CON (15 ± 76%,
p = 0.62, d = 0.0, 95% CI = −1.1 to 1.0) (Figure 5B). Therefore,
after acclimation eHIF-1α increased during exercise from rest in
CON (241 ± 193%, p = 0.003, d = 2.3, 95% CI = 0.3 to 2.7) and
HOT (76 ± 101%, p = 0.07, d = 1.8, 95% CI = −0.1 to 2.2),
however this response was attenuated in HYP in comparison to
HST1 (33 ± 83%, p = 0.30, d = 0.4, 95% CI = −0.7 to 1.4)
(Figure 5B).
Time Trial Performance
Table 4 illustrates performance changes for TT1 and TT2. There
was no difference in TT times following the intervention in the
CON group (TT1, 43:05 min:s, 95% CI = 40:18 to 45:51 min:s;
FIGURE 3 | Extracellular HIF-1α responses before and after the
acclimation period. (A) eHIF-1α is increased following an acute period of

changes in eHIF-1α were seen in CON (B) Resting eHIF-1α was elevated after
10 days of HYP and HOT acclimation, blunting the post exercise response on
day 10 of acclimation. No changes in eHIF-1α were observed in CON. (C) The
magnitude of change in resting eHIF-1α on day 10 of acclimation was no
different between HYP and HOT. Open bars and shaded bars represent pre

TT2, 43:27 min:s, 95% CI = 40:54 to 45:58 min:s; d = 0.09). The
HYP group were quicker in TT2 (41:32 min:s, 95% CI = 39:01
to 44:03 min:s) compared to TT1 (44:48 min:s, 95% CI = 42:02
to 47:33 min:s; p = 0.006, d = −1.14). The HOT group were
also quicker in TT2 (40:41 min:s, 95% CI = 38:10 to 43:12 min:s)
compared to TT1 (42:43 min:s, 95% CI = 39:58 to 45:29 min:s,
p = 0.05, d = −0.70).
Power output during TT2 was increased from TT1 in the
HYP and HOT groups (p < 0.05, Figure 6). Specifically PO was
greater during each kilometer in HYP (Figure 6B), and greater
between 1–8 km and 14–16 km in HOT (Figure 6C). HR and
Trectal were no different during the TT pre to post intervention
in any experimental group (p > 0.05, Table 4). PSI was higher in
the post intervention TT in the CON (p = 0.02) and HYP groups
(p = 0.03).

VO2 peak was unchanged from pre-intervention values in all

6.5 mL.kg−1.min−1). Additionally, peak power output and power
at lactate threshold also remained unchanged between groups
upon completion of the experimental period.
DISCUSSION
Summary of Main Findings
The main finding of this study is that fixed-work heat acclimation
reduces physiological strain, as assessed by exercising HR
and Trectal, and improves cycling TT performance in acute
normobaric hypoxia. Moreover this effect was comparable to
the decreased physiological strain and enhanced performance
achieved with hypoxic acclimation and occurred despite no post
acclimation improvement in ˙
VO2 peak or lactate threshold in any
experimental group. Therefore, the hypothesis pertaining to heat
acclimation resulting in improved systemic hypoxic tolerance is
accepted. At a cellular level both HOT and HYP increased resting
mHSP72 prior to the second HST, supporting the hypothesis
that both heat and hypoxic acclimation would enhance cellular
tolerance. As a result the cellular stress response to hypoxia was
blunted in the HYP and HOT groups. Interestingly, eHIF-1α
was elevated in both HYP and HOT immediately post exercise
after the initial acclimation session. Thereafter an increased

resting concentration was only noted following HYP (48 h post
HST). Increased baseline eHIF-1α led to a blunted post hypoxic
exercise eHIF-1α response in the HYP group, whereas data
from the HOT group was equivocal, indicating that further
study on eHIF-1α and related downstream markers regulated
by this oxygen sensing gene following heat acclimation are
warranted.
Heat and Hypoxic Cross-Acclimation
Heat acclimation induced a greater adaptive stimulus at lower
levels of metabolic strain, and in a shorter time frame
compared to hypoxic acclimation. This occurred despite the
HYP group completing sessions at a higher relative intensity
(61 ± 0.5% of H ˙
VO2 peak). Exercise durations of up to
90 min, as frequently utilized in acclimation protocols (De Castro
Magalhães et al., 2010; Gibson et al., 2015b,c) increase the
variability in trial duration between hypoxia and heat stress
(Lee et al., 2014). Therefore, matching both cardiovascular strain
and exercise duration during the initial phase of acclimation
was achieved by using a workload of 50% N ˙
VO2 peak for
60 min (Lee et al., 2014). While cardiovascular strain in the
HOT and HYP groups were each higher than CON during the
initial phases of acclimation, the total physiological strain was
greatest in the HOT group as a result of the elevated Trectal
(Table 1).
It is accepted that the sudomotor and cardiovascular
adaptations to heat stress are completed within 7–10 days
of daily exposure (Garrett et al., 2009; Castle et al., 2011).
The typical indicators of heat acclimation, such as reduced
exercising HR and Trectal and increased PV and sweat rate were
observed in the present study and were similar in magnitude
to previous work using an identical heat acclimation protocol
(Castle et al., 2011). We are confident therefore that participants
attained a heat acclimated state. Mechanistically, an increased
vascular filling time mediated by PV expansion is thought
to improve cardiovascular stability during exercise-heat stress
(Patterson et al., 2004). The observed PV expansion in the
present study was maintained until the second HST (+4%,
48 h after the final acclimation session). Although causality
cannot be determined, it is feasible that the greater PV in
HST2 mediated the increase in exercise SV thereby reducing
HR as observed in the HOT group. Additionally, exercise
Trectal and PSI were reduced during HST2, likely as a result
of the increased sweat rate. While a reduction in exercise

heat gain may improve perceptions of exercise difficulty it is
unlikely to impact on exercise performance when conditions are
compensable (Cheung et al., 2000). Instead, a reduced exercise
Trectal induces a leftward shift in the oxyhemoglobin dissociation
curve, theoretically enhancing oxygen saturation during exercise
(White et al., 2014; Gibson et al., 2015c), which is a more crucial
aspect of hypoxic exercise tolerance than maintaining thermal
balance in the compensable hypoxic conditions used in the
present study. Our results show an improved exercise SpO2 in
the HOT group post acclimation, occurring alongside greater
cardiac stability. Both the reduction in HR, and the reduced
blood viscosity (PV expansion) allows for a longer pulmonary
system red corpuscle transit time, thereby allowing for a more
complete hemoglobin re-saturation (Dempsey et al., 1984). An
enhancement in PV prior to an altitude sojourn may also

mitigate against the carotid-chemoreceptor dependent diuresis,
and subsequent reduced PV and associated reductions in left
ventricular filling pressure, stroke volume and cardiac output
observed during the initial weeks spent at moderate altitude
(Dempsey and Morgan, 2015).
Our results are comparable to those previously observed
following a period of isothermic heat acclimation (Gibson et al.,
2015c). Isothermic methods of acclimation are suggested to
offer a more complete adaptation because session by session
workloads are imposed to achieve a target Trectal >38.5◦C,
thereby maintaining the adaptive stimulus (Fox et al., 1964;
Patterson et al., 2004; Taylor and Cotter, 2006; De Castro

fixed work and isothermic models of acclimation have been
shown to offer comparable levels of acclimation at a systemic
(Gibson et al., 2015b) and gene expression level (Gibson et al.,
2015a), indicating each method possesses cross-acclimation and
cross-tolerance potential.
We observed no change in absolute ˙
VO2, in addition to
a reduction in hypoxic exercise HR 48 h after acclimation,
indicating an improvement in gross efficiency as determined
from oxygen pulse(O2 pulse). Gibson et al. (2015c) noted similar
improvements in O2 pulse during hypoxic exercise completed
24 h after the final isothermic acclimation session. Together these
data illustrate that both fixed load and isothermic acclimation
methods induce a heat acclimated phenotype which also induces
similar reductions in cardiovascular and thermoregulatory strain
upon exposure to subsequent normobaric hypoxic exercise.
We observed no post acclimation change in N ˙
VO2 peak in
all experimental groups, thus the possibility that improved
physiological strain occurred as a result of an improved post
heat acclimation ˙
VO2 peak and subsequent reduction in relative
exercise intensity can be discounted (Lorenzo et al., 2010).
Unfortunately we did not conduct a post-acclimation hypoxic
˙
VO2 peak test, so the role heat acclimation has on hypoxic aerobic
capacity could not be determined.
The duration, frequency and total number of intermittent
normobaric hypoxic exposures required to acclimate to later
normobaric hypoxia is unclear. Our present data indicates that
while SpO2 was increased during exercise in parallel with a
decrease in exercising HR on day 10 of acclimation, full hypoxic
acclimation was unlikely to have been achieved. The time course
required to achieve a more complete adaptation to normobaric
hypoxia may therefore require either additional exposures, or
an extended daily hypoxic exercise duration. For example,
intermittent hypobaric hypoxic exposures have reported a 2–3%
increase in exercise SpO2, a 9-20 bpm drop in heart rate, and
a 150–160 mL drop in ˙
VO2, and a 6.1 min (16% improvement)
in TT performance following 7 daily 4-h resting exposures
(Beidleman et al., 2008). In contrast, the same authors reported
no change in performance following a matched experimental
approach utilizing normobaric methods (Beidleman et al., 2009).
The discrepancy in results was attributed to a loss of ventilatory
acclimation during the 60 h period between the last acclimation
session and follow up testing (Beidleman et al., 2009). In the
present study it is possible a loss of ventilatory adaptation
occurred during the 48 h period between the last acclimation
session and second HST, accounting for the lack of improved
physiological tolerance during HST2. The results suggest that
heat acclimation offers a more persistent and time efficient means
of improving cardiac stability during subsequent normobaric
hypoxic exercise. Furthermore, this was attained at a lower
level of metabolic strain compared to when the same absolute
exercise intensity was conducted in normobaric hypoxia. The
optimal duration and frequency required to elicit adaptation to
normobaric hypoxia requires further study to enable additional
comparisons between environments.
Heat and Hypoxic Cross-Tolerance
Our data show that a 10 day period of fixed-work exercise
acclimation in both heat and hypoxic conditions enhances
basal mHSP72 (Figure 2B). Interestingly, the magnitude of
mHSP72 accumulation was similar between HYP and HOT
despite the greater total physiological strain accrued during
heat acclimation (Figure 2C). The time course of HSP72
accumulation throughout a period of heat or hypoxic acclimation
has not been studied. Therefore, it cannot be determined whether
the different levels of physiological strain observed between
conditions in the early phase of acclimation leads to a more
rapid or more gradual induction of protective cellular processes.
An enhanced reserve of HSP72 is one of the hallmarks of cross
tolerance observed in rodent models (Maloyan et al., 1999;
Horowitz, 2007; Horowitz and Robinson, 2007). In humans,
acclimation to both heat and hypoxia has been shown to elicit
increases in basal HSP72 (Mcclung et al., 2008; De Castro
Magalhães et al., 2010; Taylor et al., 2011, 2012) suggesting
cross-tolerance potential exists. Increased post exercise mHSP72
is likely mediated by an increase in thermal and physiological
strain in conditions of heat stress (Lee et al., 2014; Périard
et al., 2015), and a transient increase in oxidative stress under
hypoxic stress (Taylor et al., 2011, 2012). The results from the
HOT group are similar to those reported by others using either
fixed workload (Yamada et al., 2007; Mcclung et al., 2008; Hom
et al., 2012), or isothermic heat acclimation methods (De Castro
Magalhães et al., 2010). Additionally, we observed increases in
Frontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org
11

 Lee et al.
Heat Acclimation Improves Hypoxic Tolerance
resting mHSP72 following HYP acclimation, a response also
previously observed following 10 daily resting exposures to a
similar magnitude of hypoxia (Taylor et al., 2012). However,
we are unable to determine whether the increase in mHSP72
observed following hypoxic acclimation was a result of hypoxia
per-se, and the known increases in oxidative stress that occur
in such conditions, or whether the increased relative work-
load experienced in HYP was the main driver of the enhanced
basal mHSP72. The physiological and cellular strain induced in
our control group was not sufficient to induce any changes in
mHSP72, which may be due to no substantial exercise induced
changes in Trectal, nor any exercise induced increase in oxidative
stress.
It is well-established that the regulation of HSP synthesis
is dependent on the levels existing within the cell (Kregel,
2002). Consequently, prior to acclimation we observed an inverse
relationship between basal mHSP72 and the magnitude of
post exercise increase in this protein. After acclimation this
relationship was no longer present as a result of the increased
presence of mHSP72 within the cell. Under non-stressed
conditions HSP72 is bound to HSF1. When the cell is exposed
to one of the myriad of stressors that require HSP72 chaperone
function, HSP72 binds to denatured proteins, freeing HSF1 to
migrate to the nucleus and bind with the heat shock element
(HSE). More HSP72 protein is then transcribed, and continues
to bind with denatured proteins until equilibrium is restored.
Excess HSP72 then binds with the HSF1 and transcription is
halted (Morimoto, 1998). Therefore, as acclimation progresses
and basal HSP72 is accumulated, the cell becomes more robust
to the daily challenge to homeostasis imparted via a fixed model
of acclimation. As a result, the stress required to sequester HSP72
from HSF1, to begin further transcription, has to cross a new
threshold. It is this mechanism of HSP72 action that makes
the constant daily strain imparted by isothermic methods of
acclimation an attractive model for imparting cellular tolerance
(Taylor and Cotter, 2006; Gibson et al., 2015c). However, as our
data show, mHSP72 protein is enhanced after 10 days acclimation
using a simple fixed workload model, in agreement with the
elegant work of Gibson et al. (2015a,c). Furthermore, the elevated
basal mHSP72 persisted for at least 48 h after removal from the
heat and hypoxic acclimation stimuli, suggesting achievement
of a persistent phenotypic shift toward an acclimated state.
Subsequently, basal mHSP72 was higher before HST2 compared
to HST1 in both the experimental groups and the post exercise
increase in mHSP72 was attenuated in both HOT and HYP.
The role of increased cellular tolerance on physiological function
requires greater scrutiny, as we show that while both modes
of acclimation enhance cellular reserves of mHSP72, only the
heat acclimated group demonstrated improved physiological
function in later hypoxic exercise. Our data support previous
observations pertaining to improved cellular tolerance following
heat and hypoxic acclimation (Levi et al., 1993; Maloyan et al.,
1999; Taylor et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2015; Gibson et al.,
2015c).
HIF-1α, the global regulator of cellular and systemic oxygen
homeostasis, has also been suggested to play an important role
in heat and hypoxic cross tolerance in rodent models (Maloyan
et al., 2001, 2005), with increased concentrations and related
gene transcripts observed following heat acclimation (Maloyan
et al., 1999). However, the role of HIF-1α during acclimation in
humans has not been studied. We show that hypoxic acclimation
induced a doubling of HIF-1α in the circulation, an increase that
was maintained until the second HST. Subsequently, the post
HST2 eHIF-1α response was blunted in HYP. We also show an
increase in eHIF-1α after the initial heat acclimation session,
suggesting that this pathway may be an important mechanism for
both heat acclimation and cross-tolerance in humans. However,
we acknowledge that the source, function and relationship eHIF-
1α has with intracellular HIF-1α (iHIF-1α) is presently unknown.
Therefore, while these results are novel, caution is required in
their interpretation. Further research is required to determine
the relationship between eHIF-1α and iHIF-1α and other HIF-1α
associated genes and circulating markers of hypoxic adaptation
(e.g., erythropoietin). Doing so will establish the utility of eHIF-
1α as a biomarker of acclimation and cross-acclimation.
Hypoxic Time Trial Performance Before
and After Acclimation
We show, for the first time, that heat acclimation can improve
exercise performance under conditions of acute normobaric
hypoxia to levels that were comparable to those observed
following hypoxic stress. TT performance may have been
enhanced following heat acclimation as a result of greater
metabolic efficiency and glycogen sparing during the initial 40-
min steady-state pre-load trial (Febbraio et al., 2002; Lorenzo
et al., 2010). Unfortunately no measurements of muscle glycogen
content were possible in the present investigation. The reduced
post exercise BLa in the absence of a change in ˙
VO2 peak
or lactate thresholds, in combination with improved exercise
efficiency (O2 pulse) indicates a more efficient aerobic profile.
Heat acclimation is known to reduce BLa concentrations for
a given intensity (Young et al., 1985; Febbraio et al., 1994).
In the present study, mean exercise blood lactate was lower
in HST2 following both heat and hypoxic acclimation. It has
been suggested that an increase in plasma volume following
heat acclimation may have an effect on BLa via an increase in
blood flow through the splanchnic circulation, thereby enhancing
lactate removal and delaying accumulation (Lorenzo et al., 2010).
It is possible that such an effect during HST2 may have led to
glycogen sparing via a reduced rate of glycogenesis prior to the
TT, thereby preserving glycogen reserves and facilitating a greater
maintenance of power output during the TT. Alternatively, the
increased TT performance may have occurred as a result of a
learning effect following the multiple exercise sessions. However,
we took care to ensure that participants were familiarized to the
TT protocol in advance. In addition, we validated the pre-loaded
TT in our laboratory prior to testing using participants with
similar characteristics (Lee et al., 2015). Finally, if performance
changes were a result of a learning effect we would expect to see
a similar effect in the control group. Instead it appears that the
experimental groups had an altered pacing strategy as a result of
the acclimation period, with systematic kilometer by kilometer
increases in power output, HR, and physiological strain observed

in the HYP group, and an altered starting and finishing strategy
adopted by the HOT group (Figure 6).
Study Limitations
The results of the present investigation are relevant only
to those individuals with a moderate aerobic capacity and
should not be applied to those with elite physiology. However,
the maintenance of SpO2 following either HOT or HYP
acclimation is likely of more importance for more well-trained
individuals, as they typically experience reduced hemoglobin
saturation due to typically larger cardiac outputs and reduced
time for gas exchange at higher work-rates (Powers et al.,
1989). However, examining physiological responses to hypoxia
following acclimation to heat is of interest to athletes that
undergo hypoxic training camps. The potential use of heat
acclimation to increase ability to tolerate greater work-rates upon
arrival to altitude could allow for the maintenance of training
volumes and intensities during the initial sessions. However,
the role prior acclimation to heat has on longer term hypoxic
adaptation has yet to be explored. Additionally, our data only
examined normobaric hypoxia. It is possible that responses
under ecologically valid hypobaric hypoxic conditions could be
different thus future study is required.
Wider Application of Our Results
Our data indicate that heat based exercise offers a more efficient
systemic acclimation response to hypoxia in the time frame
examined than normobaric hypoxic training offers, which may
have relevance to athletes and military personnel requiring a
time-effective means of increasing work capabilities in conditions
of moderate hypoxia. An enhancement in cardiac efficiency
following repeated heat exposures may be desirable in military
populations or individuals sojourning to moderate altitude for
short durations without the means or time to fully acclimatize
before completing work tasks. Additionally, implementing a
hyperthermic stimulus to elicit cross-acclimation responses can
be achieved with little specialist equipment compared to the
chambers or sojourns required to enable altitude adaptation.
CONCLUSION
We show, for the first time, that heat acclimation can
improve exercise performance under conditions of acute
normobaric hypoxia to levels that were comparable to those
observed following hypoxic acclimation. Fixed work heat
acclimation is shown to be an effective intervention when
improvements in hypoxic exercise tolerance or endurance
performance are required. It was demonstrated that heat
acclimation was a more effective and longer term (48 h post
acclimation) means of improving systemic hypoxic tolerance,
as quantified by exercise HR and SpO2, than a matched
duration and work period of hypoxic acclimation. Both heat
and hypoxic acclimation elicit similar changes at the protein
level, with each increasing basal HSP72 and eHIF-1α, along
with attenuation of post HST HSP72 and eHIF-1α responses
to an acute bout of hypoxic exercise. These data confirm
previous findings using isothermic models of acclimation and
illustrate that increasing physiological strain via exercise-heat
stress is an effective, and simple to administer, intervention for
invoking both cross-acclimation and cellular cross-tolerance in
humans.
