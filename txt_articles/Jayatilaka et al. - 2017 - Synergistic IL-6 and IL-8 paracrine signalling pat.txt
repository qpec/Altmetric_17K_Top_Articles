Following uncontrolled proliferation, a subset of primary tumour cells acquires additional
traits/mutations to trigger phenotypic changes that enhance migration and are hypothesized
to be the initiators of metastasis. This study reveals an adaptive mechanism that harnesses
synergistic paracrine signalling via IL-6/8, which is amplified by cell proliferation and cell
density, to directly promote cell migration. This effect occurs in metastatic human sarcoma
and carcinoma cells– but not in normal or non-metastatic cancer cells-, and likely involves the
downstream signalling of WASF3 and Arp2/3. The transcriptional phenotype of high-density
cells that emerges due to proliferation resembles that of low-density cells treated with a
combination of IL-6/8. Simultaneous inhibition of IL-6/8 receptors decreases the expression
of WASF3 and Arp2/3 in a mouse xenograft model and reduces metastasis. This study
reveals a potential mechanism that promotes tumour cell migration and infers a strategy to
decrease metastatic capacity of tumour cells.

 U
ncontrolled cell proliferation is a hallmark of cancer that
leads to the development of primary tumours1, which
may be followed by further progression to metastasis, the
spread of cancer cells from a primary organ to distal sites2. Cell
proliferation and migration are two key drivers of metastasis that
are regulated by complex interactions of multiple pathways that
can
either
concurrently
or
divergently
stimulate
the
two
processes. Some studies have shown that the two processes
occur simultaneously; proliferation and migration are both
stimulated
by
secreted
factors
such
as
fibroblast
growth
factors3,4. Other studies suggest that the two processes are
mutually
exclusive;
primary
tumour
cells
proliferate
uncontrollably with tight cell-cell junction and low mobility,
while metastatic invasive tumour cells seem to delay proliferation
during migration5–9.
Cancer cells in the tumour microenvironment (TME) can
secrete proteins, such as cytokines, that can interact with stromal
and immune cells in a collagen-rich three-dimensional (3D)
extracellular matrix10,11, to mediate intercellular communications
and collectively modulate pathophysiological processes, including
cancer-induced angiogenesis and metastasis12,13. For instance, the
highly invasive nature of human brain tumours, such as
glioblastoma multiform, has been attributed to its unique
secretomic profile14. However, secretomic profiles evolve as
cancer cells proliferate and eventually progress to a higher
grade (that is, as cells become more invasive)15,16, suggesting a
possible role for secreted paracrine factors to couple proliferation
and migration. As the local concentration of secreted proteins
increases with cell number, we speculate that the contribution of
proliferation-induced local crowding, accompanied by increased
local cell density in the collagen-rich 3D TME, may be a
significant, yet largely unidentified factor that directly alters
tumour cell migration17.
In this study, we find that metastatic human sarcoma and
carcinoma cells exhibit enhanced migration as a consequence of
cell proliferation, which causes increased cell density in 3D
collagen matrices. This increase in cell density causes significant
enhancement in cell migration due to an increase in the secretion
of specific soluble proteins. Using a high-throughput multiplexing
cell secretomic profiling assay, we demonstrate that only
interleukin 6 (IL-6) and Interleukin 8 (IL-8) are specifically
increased with cell density. We also found that IL-6 and IL-8 are
necessary and sufficient to increase tumour cell migration in a cell
density dependent manner with negligible feedback on cell
proliferation. This effect is specific to metastatic cancer cells; IL-6
and IL-8 have no effect on the migration of normal and non-
metastatic cancer cells. Enhanced cell migration likely occurs
through increased expression of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome
protein family member 3 (WASF3), which in turn regulates actin
cytoskeleton dynamics through the recruitment of the Arp2/3
complex, increasing the formation of dendritic protrusions and
thus driving cell migration18. Therapeutic targeting of the
receptors of IL-6 and IL-8 using Tocilizumab and Reparixin
significantly decreases the expression of the Arp2/3 complex in a
mouse xenograft model and decreases metastasis of breast cancer
cells to the lungs, liver, and lymph nodes. This study reveals a
synergistic paracrine signalling pathway that when inhibited has
the potential to decrease the metastatic capacity of cancer cells
and thereby improve patient outcomes.
Results
Increase in tumour cell density enhances cell motility. To assess
the potential effect of cell proliferation–and associated increase in
local cell density–on cancer cell migration in vitro, human
fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells, a cell line commonly used in studies
of cell migration19–22, were embedded in 3D type I collagen
matrices. Collagen I is not only the main extracellular matrix
component of connective tissues, but is also enriched in
the
vicinity
of
carcinoma
and
sarcoma
tumours23.
Cell
migratory patterns within the matrix were monitored for 16.5 h
using live-cell phase-contrast microscopy at a rate of 30 frames/h
every
other day
for
5 days.
This
analysis
revealed
that
fibrosarcoma cells became progressively more motile as cells
proliferated and increased local cell density (Fig. 1a–c). To
investigate the role of increased cell density on cancer cell
migration, we seeded increasing cell densities in 3D matrices and
observed cell migration. The initial cell densities used in the
experiments, ranging from 10 cells mm � 3 to 120 cells mm � 3,
corresponded to average cell-to-cell distances from 470 to 130 mm
in the 3D matrix, distances that were significantly larger than the
average cell size (10–20 mm in diameter)24. This data revealed that
cells became progressively more motile as cell density increased.
This enhanced motility cannot be attributed to repulsive cell–cell
interactions as the tracked cells did not come in contact
with other cells. Cell speed eventually plateaued for cell
densities higher than 100 cells mm � 3 (Fig. 1d,e). Similar trends
were observed for migration parameters such persistence of
migration and invasive distance (Fig. 1f and Supplementary
Fig. 1A and B)25.
We have previously shown that cell motility in 3D matrices is
predicted by the ability of cells to form dendritic pseudopodial
protrusions19,26. Consistent with these observations, we found
that the total number of main and dendritic protrusions
generated per unit time by tumour cells steadily increased and
then plateaued with cell density. The cell-density-dependent
number of protrusions generated by the cells is strongly
correlated with the cell-density-dependent cell speed (Fig. 1g,h
and Supplementary Fig. 1C).
This remarkable relationship between tumour cell density and
cell migration was also found in human metastatic carcinoma
cells (MDA-MB-231) and human metastatic glioblastoma cells
(U-87). Similar to fibrosarcoma cells, the migration of these
two tumorigenic, metastatic/invasive cell lines increased with
cell
density
(Fig.
1i,j
and
Supplementary
Fig.
1D).
In
contrast, cell-density-dependent migration was not observed
in tumorigenic, non-metastatic carcinoma cells (MCF7) and
non-tumorigenic cell lines WI-38 human lung fibroblasts and
MCF10A human epithelial cells (Supplementary Fig. 1E–G).
Interestingly,
cell-density-dependent
migration
was
not
observed when cells were placed on two-dimensional (2D)
collagen-coated substrates (Supplementary Fig. 1H–J). Moreover,
in contrast to 3D cell migration, the proliferation of cells in 3D
matrices
was
unaffected
by
cell
density
(Fig.
1k
and
Supplementary Fig. 1K), that is, cells continued to proliferate at
a constant rate regardless of cell density. Together, these results
indicate that cancer cell density enhances cancer cell migration,
but not proliferation, and that cell-density-dependent migration
could
be
unique
to
tumorigenic,
metastatic
cells
in
3D
microenvironments.
Cell migration enhancement is not caused by ECM remodelling.
Cell-density-dependent
migration
could
be
mediated
by
the
collagen
matrix
and
cell-induced
matrix
remodelling.
We investigated if cell density modulated the microstructural
properties of the matrix, such as inter-fibre spacing (effective
pore
size)
and
local
fibre
alignment27.
Using
quantitative
reflection confocal microscopy, we determined that local fibre
alignment showed poor correlation with cell density and speed.
Average inter-fibre spacing showed a poor correlation with cell
speed as well.

 As expected, a strong negative correlation was identified
between average inter-fibre spacing and cell density. As the cell
density increases, the forces exerted on the collagen fibrils by the
cells increases, causing the space between the fibrils to decrease.
(Fig. 2a–d and Supplementary Fig. 2A) Based on this result alone,
we would have expected cell speed to decrease with increasing cell
density but since the cells move faster as cell density increases
this physical property cannot modulate cell-density-dependent
migration. In sum, cell-density-dependent migration cannot be
attributed to changes in the physical properties of the matrix.
Secretomic profiles of matrix-embedded tumour cells. Based on
these
results,
we
hypothesized
that
cell-density-dependent
migration was regulated by soluble molecules secreted by the cells
in a cell-density-dependent manner. To test this hypothesis,
we introduced conditioned medium collected from a matrix
containing a high density of HT1080 cells (50 cells mm � 3) into a
matrix containing a low density of HT1080 cells (10 cells mm � 3).
We found that the enhanced cell velocity observed at high cell
density could be recapitulated at a low cell density by adding
condition medium collected from high cell density matrices

 (Fig. 2e,f). This result suggests that soluble molecules secreted by
matrix embedded cancer cells are sufficient to promote enhanced
cell migration.
To identify the soluble factor(s) driving enhanced motility, we
measured and analysed the secretomic profiles of HT1080 and
MDA-MB-231 cells embedded at low and high densities in 3D
matrices, using a multiplex antibody microarray assay28. This assay
simultaneously measured the concentration of 24 soluble molecules.
We observed that the cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 were both secreted in
relatively high concentrations and increased linearly with cell
density for both cell lines. Remarkably, all other secreted proteins
that were assayed including hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which
has been implicated in promoting tumour progression and tumour
metastasis in several cancers29, were not elevated at higher cell
densities during our experimental time window (Fig. 2g,h). Using
ELISA, we confirmed our results and determined the precise
concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 at specific cell densities of
matrix-embedded HT1080 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 2i–l).
Together, this result suggests that IL-6 and IL-8 drive density-
dependent cell migration in 3D matrices.

 IL-6 and IL-8 together induce enhanced cell migration. Next,
we systematically assessed whether IL-6 and IL-8 were required to
drive cell-density-enhanced migration by conducting gain-of-
function and loss-of-function experiments. We exposed matrix
embedded HT1080 cells seeded at a low density to controlled
concentrations of human recombinant IL-6 and IL-8. We found
that IL-6 or IL-8 alone had no effect on cell migration, even at
high concentrations (Fig. 3a,b and Supplementary Fig. 3A and B).
In contrast, IL-6 and IL-8, when combined at the prescribed
concentrations found at the high density of 50 cells mm � 3 in the
precise stoichiometric ratio of 5:2, induced cells at low density to
move at the high velocity observed at high cell density and also
detected for cells at low density exposed to conditioned medium
(Fig. 3c). Strikingly, other stoichiometric ratios of IL-6 and IL-8
did not induce enhanced migration (Supplementary Fig. 3C).
These results indicate that a mixture of IL-6 and IL-8 is sufficient
to recapitulate the enhanced migration of cells embedded at high
densities.
To verify that both cytokines were required for cell-density-
dependent migration, we conducted experiments with condi-
tioned medium from HT1080 cells depleted of IL-6 or IL-8 via
shRNA interference. Depleting either IL-6 or IL-8 prevented the
conditioned medium from high density matrices to enhance cell
migration of low density matrices (Fig. 3d). Similar results were
obtained when we utilized specific neutralizing antibodies to
block secreted IL-6 and IL-8. The loss-of-function assays
conducted with matrix-embedded cells at low and high cell
densities exposed to specific neutralizing antibodies and with
matrix embedded HT1080 cells depleted of IL-6 and IL-8
demonstrated that the cell-density-dependent migration patterns
observed previously were no longer detected (Fig. 3e and
Supplementary Fig. 3G–I). These results were confirmed with
matrix embedded MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3f). Interestingly, as
with HT1080 cells, the enhanced migration of MDA-MB-231
cells was observed when IL-6 and IL-8 were present in the
stoichiometric ratio of 5:2 (Supplementary Fig. 3D). In marked
contrast, tumorigenic, non-metastatic cells, MCF7, and non-
tumorigenic cells, MCF10A, exposed to both IL-6 and IL-8 did
not exhibit enhanced migration (Supplementary Fig. 3E and F).
These results suggest that IL-6 and IL-8 are each individually
required, but only sufficient in combination to induce enhanced
migration in tumorigenic, metastatic cells (Fig. 3g).
Further, we hypothesized that enhanced migration through
the synergistic signalling of IL-6 and IL-8 is sensed by the cells
via a paracrine pathway through the receptors of IL-6 (IL-6R)
and IL-8 (IL8R1/CXCR1 or IL8R2/CXCR2). Matrix-embedded
cells are exposed to a gradient of secreted proteins that can
readily build up around a cell and consequently paracrine
signalling can occur as the inter-cellular distance is decreased
with an increase in cell density. As a result, the paracrine
signalling could trigger a response in cellular behaviour (for
example, enhanced migration). Our results demonstrated that
the expression of IL-6R and CXCR2 indeed increased as cell
density increased, indicating that signalling pathway is para-
crine (Supplementary Fig. 3J and K).
We next explored possible therapeutic targets to decrease
metastatic capacity by inhibiting the cell-density-dependent
paracrine signalling pathway. The receptors on tumour cell
membranes are also important drivers in signalling pathways and
thus could be targeted to inhibit a particular phenotype. HT1080
and MDA-MB-231 cells depleted of IL-6R and CXCR2 (Referred
to from this point on as IL-8R) via shRNA interference were
embedded in 3D collagen matrices. We found that the depletion
of IL-6R had no effect on cell migration at low cell density. In
contrast, this molecular intervention suppressed cell velocity at
elevated cell densities. Interestingly, cells depleted of IL-8R
displayed a reduction in cell velocity at both low and high cell
densities (Fig. 3h and Supplementary Figs 3L and 6A–D).
To determine pharmacological agents for potential therapeutic
interventions, inhibitors of IL-6R (Tocilizumab) and IL-8R
(Reparixin) were added to matrix-embedded cells at low and
high densities. Tocilizumab induced a small decrease in HT1080
cell velocity at low cell density, but induced a more visible
decrease in cell velocity at high cell density. Reparixin decreased
cell velocity at both low and high cell densities, with notable
reduction in cell velocity at higher Reparixin concentrations
(Fig. 3j). The combination of the two inhibitors showed a
decrease in cell velocity at both low and high cell densities
(Fig. 3k). We observed similar effects of the inhibitors on the
velocity of MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3l and Supplementary
Fig. 3M and N).
Cell density induces a distinct transcriptional phenotype. To
confirm the formation of a more invasive and migratory phe-
notype solely induced by cell proliferation and increase of cell
density, we performed global transcriptional phenotype analysis
by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)30. The transcriptomes of HT1080
cells at low density (LD) and high density (HD) were sequenced
and compared for differential gene expression. They were
also compared with the transcriptomes of HT1080 cells at a
low density exposed to recombinant IL-6 alone (IL-6), IL-8 alone
(IL-8), and IL-6 and IL-8 found in the precise concentrations at
the high density of 50 cells mm � 3 (RM). To identify the sources
of transcriptional variations caused by different conditions, we
performed an ANOVA-like test to detect the genes most variable
among multiple groups. To study the relationship of global
transcriptomes, principle component analysis (PCA) of the top
930 most significant genes was performed. PCA demonstrated
that the transcriptomes of LD, IL-6 and IL-8 cluster in close
proximity in the third quadrant while RM shows a phenotypical
shift toward HD in the second quadrant. RM and HD residing in
the same quadrant indicate the phenotypic similarity between
cell-proliferation-induced
migratory
phenotype
and
the
phenotype
generated
by
RM
(Fig.
4a).

was confirmed with differential gene expression analysis.
Next, we performed ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) to
investigate the biological mechanisms underlying transcriptional
phenotypes by analysing the functional annotation of differential
expression gene clusters and pathway enrichment. The most
enriched gene ontology category of the genes highly expressed in
RM was ‘cell movement’. Another group of genes, which were
highly expressed in IL-6, IL-8 and LD but downregulated in RM,
was cellular metabolism and division-related pathways. This
result suggests that RM induces a strong phenotype with
enhanced cell movement. Other biological pathways contributing
to the change of LD to HD cell phenotype include cell death and
survival, cell metabolic activity, cell cycle and division. (Fig. 4b,c
and Supplementary Fig. 4A and B).
Mechanism of cell-density-dependent migration. Signal trans-
ducer and activator of transcription 3, STAT3, is a transcription
factor that is a common downstream effector in the individual
pathways
of
IL-6
and
IL-8
(refs
31,32).
Therefore,
we
hypothesized that STAT3 could regulate cell-density-dependent
migration. We found that the activity of STAT3 in matrix
embedded HT1080 cells at a high density was two fold higher
than that of cells at a low density (Fig. 4d).
Based on our previous work, we further speculated that the
Arp2/3
complex
nucleates
F-actin
assembly
and
mediates
dendritic
protrusions

cell-density-dependent

 migration19. Thus, we reasoned that enhanced migration may
be regulated by the Arp2/3 complex through the (Janus kinase)
JAK/STAT3 pathway. Through examinations of the migration of
HT1080 cells at low and high cell densities exposed to the
specific JAK2 inhibitor AG-490 (ref. 33), STAT3 inhibitor S3I-201
(ref. 34), or Arp 2/3 complex inhibitor CK666 (ref. 35), we
determined that JAK2, STAT3 and the Arp2/3 complex were
indeed required for cell-density-dependent migration. Treatment
with any of the three inhibitors prevented cell-density-dependent
migration
by
repressing
protrusion
activity
(Fig.
4e
and
Supplementary Fig. 4C).
To further determine the role of the Arp2/3 complex in
cell-density-dependent migration, we measured the mRNA
expression of the ACTR2 and protein expression of ARP2 and
ARP3 and determined they wereslightly upregulated at HD
(Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 6E–H). We also measured
protrusions and branching frequency for LD, HD, IL-6, IL-8 and
RM conditions and demonstrated that IL-6 and IL-8 did not
increase protrusion frequency or branching frequency but RM
significantly did. (Fig. 4g and Supplementary Fig. 4D).
Because WASF3 is involved in the regulation of actin
cytoskeleton dynamics through the recruitment of the Arp2/3
complex36–38,
we
also
hypothesized
that
WASF3
was
an
important intermediate between STAT3 and Arp2/3. Thus, we
quantified the mRNA expression of WASF3 at LD, HD, IL-6, IL-8
and RM and found a relatively higher expression of WASF3 at
HD and RM compared with LD, IL-6 and IL-8. Additionally, the
protein level for WASF3 increased at HD (Supplementary Fig. 6I
and J). RNAseq analysis also indicated that WASF3 was
upregulated at RM but not when the interleukins were present
individually (Fig. 4h and Supplementary Fig. 4E). Further we
depleted WASF3 through shRNA interference and found that
cell-density-dependent
migration
was
not
observed.
(Supplementary Fig. 4F and G) These results suggest that
WASF3 together with the Arp2/3 complex are important
regulators in the pathway that controls cell-density-dependent
migration (Fig. 4i).
Interestingly, when the expression of STAT3, WASF3 and
ACTR2 were measured for differing stoichiometric ratios of IL-6
and IL-8, we observed that the expression of these three
intermediates
were
maximally
stimulated
under
the
5:2
conditions (Supplementary Fig. 4H–J).
Mouse xenograft model to test therapeutic strategies. Given
that IL-6 and IL-8 cooperate to enhance migration in breast
carcinoma cells, we sought to investigate their potential role
in
metastasis
by
inhibiting
their
cognate
receptors
using
Tocilizumab and Reparixin. Tocilizumab is currently in clinical
trials to study its efficacy against recurrent ovarian cancer20, while
Reparixin
is
being
evaluated
for
safety,
tolerability,
pharmacokinetics, and to detect early signs of antitumour
activity in breast cancer patients22,23. The effect of these drugs
on metastasis was examined by generating an animal model
through the introduction of MDA-MB-231 carcinoma breast
cancer cells into the mammary fat pad of NSG (NOD SCID
Gamma) mice and injecting four sets of mice with saline,
Tocilizumab alone (25 mg kg � 1), Reparixin alone (30 mg kg � 1),
and Tocilizumab and Reparixin in combination every three days
for 6 weeks.
As predicted from our in vitro results (Fig. 1k), we observed
that the treatment had no effect on the rate of tumour growth
(Supplementary Fig. 5A and B). We also determined that
metastasis to the lungs, liver, and lymph nodes were suppressed
in the treated group. Specifically, the combination of the two
drugs was the most effective in repressing metastatic burden on
the liver and the lymph nodes (Fig. 5a–f). Moreover, the
expression of the key intermediates in the synergistic pathway,
STAT3, WASF3 and ACTR2, were significantly decreased in
the treated group suggesting that the cell-density-dependent
paracrine signalling pathway was responsible for the decreased
metastases observed. (Fig. 5g–i) Immuno-histochemical staining
for ACTR2 confirmed expression in control tumours and
markedly decreased expression in the tumours from mice treated
with the combination of drugs (Fig. 5j,k).
Our in vitro and in vivo findings describe a novel synergistic
paracrine signalling pathway between IL-6 and IL-8 that plays
a critical role in metastasis through the regulation of cell-density-
dependent tumour cell migration. Thus, this study infers a new
therapeutic target to decrease the metastatic capacity of tumour
cells and improve patient outcomes.
Discussion
This study suggests that as cancer cells proliferate and local cell
density increases accordingly, the secretion profile of cancer cells
in the TME may be dynamically altered and this may play an
important role in metastasis. Increased local cell density directly
enhances cell migration in metastatic cells embedded in 3D
matrices by increasing IL-6 and IL-8 levels. Interestingly,
cell-density-dependent migration is unique to tumorigenic,
metastatic cells exposed to 3D microenvironments, not 2D flat
surfaces, which reconstitute features of tissues that enable in vitro
recapitulation of in vivo function including spatiotemporal
gradients of biochemical cues such as cytokines and growth
factors39.
Further, this study identified a novel synergistic mechanism
between IL-6 and IL-8 required to promote cell-density-
dependent migration. IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine that has been
associated with tumour progression and metastasis in different
types of cancers40–42. IL-8 has also been implicated in promoting
angiogenesis and tumorigenicity, promoting a cancer stem cell
phenotype,
and
enhancing
metastasis
in
multiple
cancer
types43,44. Moreover, clinical data indicates that both IL-6 and
IL-8 are found at high concentrations in the serum of patients
with lung and liver metastases45, which suggests that they may
play a critical role in metastasis46. Previous clinical studies have
also shown that the serum concentrations of these two cytokines
strongly correlate with the stage of cancer47. The results of this
study explain the underlying mechanisms that account for these
observations in 3D collagen-rich TMEs where tumour cells
rapidly
proliferate
and
increase
local
cell
density16,48,49.
Strikingly, our data also suggests that this synergistic IL-6/8
paracrine pathway-mediated enhancement of cell migration is an
adaptive process dictated by cell signalling and differs from the
mechanism associated with cancer-stem-cell (CSC). The cells
used in this investigation did not display CSC characteristics as
revealed by bulk RNA-seq50,51
Our findings further emphasize the necessity of 3D cultures in
pharmaceutical studies as monolayer cell culture methods remain
the de facto prevalent testing platform51. Cells cultured on dishes
adopt physiologically
irrelevant morphology and
signalling
patterns52. For instance, the cell-density-dependent migration
seen in 3D is not observed on 2D substrates. In addition, there are
currently no commercial therapeutics that specifically target
metastasis which is responsible for 90% of cancer related deaths53.
This study suggests that by concurrently inhibiting the identified
pathway with Tocilizumab (a humanized monoclonal antibody
currently used to treat rheumatoid arthritis54) and Reparixin
metastasis can be directly targeted and decreased. Although these
agents are individually studied in clinical trials for their efficacy
against different types of cancers55–59, they have not been

 evaluated as anti-metastasis therapeutics in highly invasive
cancers.
This
study
suggests
that
simultaneous
use
of
Tocilizumab
and
Reparixin
could
greatly
decrease
the
metastatic capacity of tumours, thereby potentially improve
cancer patient outcomes similar to Denosumab which is a human
monoclonal antibody that was initially developed to treat
osteoporosis60, but later found to be effective in the treatment
of multiple myeloma and giant cell tumour of the bone61.
Our observations also demonstrate that IL-6 and IL-8 work
uniquely in a cell-autonomous manner through paracrine
signalling
amongst
the
same
population
of
cancer
cells.
Previously,
inflammatory
signals
released
from
infiltrating
immune cells have been implicated in tumour progression,
invasion, and metastasis. However, our work revealed a new
mechanism for tumour-secreted IL-6 and IL-8, but not common
inflammatory cytokines such as TNFa and IL-1b secreted by
immune cells, to promote tumour cell migration and metastasis.
Through this study, we have shown that the inhibition of the
synergistic IL-6/8 signalling pathway reduces metastatic burden
in mice, suggesting a potential strategy to prevent or treat cancer
metastasis through the inhibition of tumour cell-density-depen-
dent migration.
Methods
Cell culture. Human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells (ATCC) were cultured in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Mediatech) supplemented with 10%
(v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone Laboratories), and 0.005% (w/v) gentamicin
(Quality Biological). Human breast carcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells (ATCC) and
MCF-7 cells (ATCC) were cultured in DMEM (Mediatech) supplemented with
10% FBS (Hyclone). Human glioblastoma U-87 MG cells (ATCC) were cultured
in DMEM (Mediatech) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone). Human diploid
cell line, WI-38, (ATCC) were cultured in Eagle’s minimal essential medium
(EMEM, Mediatech) supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone). Human breast
epithelial MCF10A cells (ATCC) and MCF12A cells (ATCC) were cultured in
DMEM supplemented with 5% horse serum (Atlanta biologicals), 20 ng ml � 1
Human epidermal growth factor (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 ng ml � 1 cholera toxin,
(Sigma-Aldrich) 0.01 mg ml � 1 bovine insulin (Life technologies), and 500 ng ml � 1
hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich). HT1080 cells transfected with shRNAs
(see below) were grown in medium containing 1 mg ml � 1 puromycin. The cells
were maintained at 37 �C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator during cell culture
and during live-cell microscopy. All cell lines were tested for mycoplasma and
deemed free of contamination.
Depletion of proteins with shRNAs. Target proteins were depleted by cotrans-
fecting the shRNA construct (Supplementary Table 1) with two other packaging
plasmids, pMD.G VSV-G and pCMVDR8.91 (encoding Gag, Pol, Tat and Rev)
using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). 293T cells at around
80% confluence were transfected with a mixture of 6 mg of lentiviral shRNA
construct, 8 mg of pCMVDR8.91, and 1 mg of pMD.G VSV-G. The conditioned
medium containing the lentivirus was harvested 48 h after transfection and filtered
through a 0.4-mm filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) to remove cell debris.
For transduction, HT1080 cells were grown to 50–60% confluence in a 6-cm cell
culture dish. Medium (2 ml) containing lentivirus was mixed with 1 ml of fresh
medium containing protamine sulfate (final concentration 10 mg ml � 1) and
added to HT1080 cells. After 8 h incubation, the medium containing the viruses
was replaced with fresh medium containing 1 mg ml � 1 puromycin for selection.
shRNA constructs targeting various genes were purchased from Sigma. (Taken
from Giri et al.19).
After lentiviral-mediated transduction, Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assays
(ELISA) (Supplementary Fig. 3H and I), PCR studies (Supplementary Fig. 4G), and
western blots (Supplementary Fig. 6A–D) were performed and only shRNAs
showing more than 85% knockdown were used for subsequent studies.
The transfected cells were embedded in type I collagen matrices and incubated
overnight at 37 �C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. The conditioned media
from the cells were collected and filtered through a 0.45-mm filter (Millipore) to
remove cell debris. The total quantity of IL-6 and IL-8 produced by the cells were
measured using Human quantikine ELISA kits (R&D systems). Data represented
was obtained from three independent experiments.
3D collagen I matrix. HT1080 cells were embedded in 2 mg ml � 1 type I collagen
gel as described previously by Fraley et al.31 Briefly, cell suspensions containing
5,000 to 75,000 cells in 1:1 (v/v) ratio of cell culture media and reconstitution buffer
were mixed with appropriate volume of soluble rat-tail collagen I (Corning Inc.) to
obtain a final collagen I concentration of 2 mg ml � 1. A calculated amount of 1 M
NaOH was added quickly and the final solution was mixed well to bring the pH to
B7. The cell suspension was added to a 24-well coverslip-bottom cell-culture dish
and immediately transferred to an incubator maintained at 37 �C to allow
polymerization. Fresh medium was added 1 h before imaging. MDA-MB-231 and
U-87 cells were embedded in 1 mg ml � 1 type I collagen matrix. The data
represented for each cell line were obtained from three independent experiments.
Speed and protrusion topology of matrix embedded cells. Phase-contrast
images of matrix-embedded cells were recorded 2 min apart for 16.5 h using a
Cascade 1K CCD camera (Roper Scientific) mounted on a Nikon TE2000
microscope with a 10X objective lens. A minimum of 50 single cells were tracked
using Metamorph imaging software. A custom MATLAB program calculated the
velocity for each cell using the x- and y-coordinates obtained from tracking data
using the following equation:

For the characterization of protrusion topology, the movies were used to count
the total number of mother protrusions, and the number of first-, second-, and
third-generation protrusions generated by the cell (Fig. 1c). The protrusions
emanating directly from the cell body, even when split, were termed mother
protrusions; protrusions originating from the mother protrusions were termed
first-generation, and so on. Mitotic cells were not included in the measurements.
Persistence and invasive distance were obtained by the methods described by Wu
et al.30 Data represented was obtained from three independent experiments.
Proliferation assays. HT1080 cells were embedded in type I 3D collagen matrices
in increasing cell numbers from 5,000 to 60,000 cells. Phase contrast images of the
cells were recorded 8 min apart for 48 h. The average doubling time was obtained
by measuring the time between the 1st and 2nd divisions. Cell viability assay using
Prestoblue (Invitrogen) was also conducted on the matrix-embedded cells of
increasing cell number. Fluorescence was measured every 6 h for 48 h. Data
represented was obtained from three independent experiments.
Collagen inter-fibre spacing and alignment. Matrix embedded cells with cell
densities ranging from 10 cells mm � 3 to 150 cells mm � 3were imaged and analysed
according to the methods highlighted in Fraley et al.32 to determine the inter-fibre
spacing and alignment. Data represented was obtained from three independent
experiments.
Condition medium and high throughput secretomic analysis. Matrix-embedded
cells with cell densities ranging from 10 cells mm � 3 to 150 cells mm � 3 were
incubated for 24 h at 37 �C in a humidified incubator. The conditioned medium
from the cells was then collected and filtered through a 0.45-mm filter (Millipore) to
remove cell debris. High throughput secretomic analysis was conducted on the
condition medium collected as described previously by Lu et al.33 Data represented
was obtained from three experimental replicates.
Conditioned medium from HT1080 cells embedded in matrices with a cell
density of 50 cells mm � 3 was added to freshly made matrices with a cell density of
10 cells mm � 3. These conditions were replicated when extracting conditioned
medium from the HT1080 transfected cells. Data represented was obtained from
three independent experiments.
Gain of function and antibody blocking assays. Recombinant IL-6 and IL-8
(R&D systems) reconstituted in DPBS (Life technologies) were added to matrix
embedded cells with a cell density of 10 cells mm � 3 and imaged as described above
(See velocity and protrusion topology of matrix embedded cells). Matrix embedded
cells with cell densities of 10 cells mm � 3 and 50 cells mm � 3 were exposed to
specific IL-6 (Proteintech; catalog #21865-1-AP) and IL-8 (Proteintech; catalog
#60141-2-Ig) functional antibodies, at a concentration of 0.5 mg ml � 1. Data
represented was obtained from three independent experiments.
STAT3 and WASF3 activity. Matrix embedded cells with cell densities of
10 cells mm � 3 and 50 cells mm � 3 were incubated for 24 h at 37 �C in a humidified
incubator. The matrices were exposed to cell lysis buffer and mechanically broken
down using a syringe. The suspension was centrifuged and the supernatant was
measured for STAT3 and PhosphoSTAT3 using an ELISA kit (Abcam). WASF3
expression was measured using qRT-PCR for the cell densities stated previously
and matrix embedded cells with a cell density of 10 cells mm � 3 exposed to IL-6
and IL-8 alone and in combination at the precise concentrations found at a high
cell density of 50 cells mm � 3. Total RNA isolation was performed with RNA
MiniPrep kit (Zymo research). cDNA synthesis was carried out as previously
described by Gilkes et al.62 The sequence for the cDNA primers that were used
during PCR are found in Supplementary Table 2. Data represented was obtained
from three independent experiments.

 Transcriptome analysis by RNA sequencing and analysis of RNA-Seq data.
Total RNA isolation was performed as described in the previous section. cDNA
synthesis, sequencing and analysis of RNA-Seq data were conducted as previously
described by Guo et al.63 Data represented was obtained from one experiment.
Inhibitor assays. Matrix embedded cells with low and high cell densities were
exposed to IL-8R inhibitor, Reparixin (Cayman Chemical), IL-6R inhibitor,
Tocilizumab (Genentech), JAK2 inhibitor, AG-490 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
STAT3 inhibitor, S3I-201, (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Arp2/3 complex
inhibitor, CK 666, (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h before cells were imaged as described
above (see velocity and protrusion topology of matrix embedded cells). Cell
viability assays using Prestoblue (Invitrogen) were also conducted on matrix
embedded cells exposed to Reparixin and Tocilizumab. Data represented was
obtained from three independent experiments.
In vivo mouse work. Studies using 5–7 week-old NSG (NOD SCID Gamma) mice
were carried out according to protocols approved by the Johns Hopkins University
Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals. All mice were housed at a temperature of 25 �C
under a 12-hr dark/light cycle. NSG mice were obtained from Johns Hopkins
Medical Institution. Tocilizumab and saline for injection were obtained from the
research pharmacy of The Johns Hopkins Hospital. Reparixin was obtained from
Cayman Chemical and Med Chem Express.
MDA-MB-231 cells were harvested by trypsinization, resuspended at
107 cells ml � 1 in a 1:1 mix of PBS:Matrigel and 1 � 106 cells were injected into the
mammary fat pad (MFP) of the mouse. After 10 days, mice received a
subcutaneous injection of either 100 ml Tocilizumab alone (25 mg kg � 1), 300 ml
Reparixin (30 mg kg � 1) alone or a combination of Tocilizumab and Reparixin. The
control mice received 100 ml of a saline solution. Primary tumours were measured
in two dimensions (a and b), and volume was calculated as 4/3p ((a � b)/2)3. Mice
were sacrificed after 6 weeks. Tumours were excised, weighed and processed for
RNA isolation and tissue lysate preparation. Expression of STAT3, WASF3 and
ACTR2 were measured using PCR methods.
Lungs were perfused with agarose. One lung was inflated for formalin
fixation and paraffin embedding; the other lung was used to isolate genomic DNA
for qPCR (Supplementary Table 2). Genomic DNA was isolated from the livers.
The livers, tumours, and lymph nodes were sectioned and stained with Vimentin
(Sigma; catalog #V2258) at a dilution of 1:200 and ACTR2 (Protein tech; catalog
#10922-1-AP) at a dilution of 1:50. Images were acquired by Nikon Eclipse NI-U
and analysed using ImageJ64. Data represented for each condition was obtained
from five animals.
Western blot. Matrix embedded cells with cell densities of 10 cells mm � 3 and
50 cells mm � 3 were incubated for 24 h at 37 �C in a humidified incubator. Matrix
embedded cells were lysed on ice in RIPA buffer, Protease inhibitor cocktail and
Phosphatase-inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) and mechanically broken down
using a syringe. The suspension was centrifuged and the supernatant was further
centrifuged in Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filters (Millipore) Protein concentration
was measured by bradford assay (BioRad) and 50 mg of protein was loaded into
each well. Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and trans-
ferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (BioRad). These were blocked
with 5% milk in TBS, then incubated with primary antibodies, CXCR2 (Novus
Biologicals; catalog #NBP2-43810) (Dilution of 1:1,000), IL6R (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology; catalog #sc-655) (Dilution of 1:1,000), and b actin (Cell Signaling
Technology; #5125) (Dilution of 1:1,000). Membranes washed in 0.1% Tween-TBS
and bound primary antibodies were detected with Peroxidase-conjugated goat
anti-rabbit antibodies (Cell signaling technology) using the ECL detection system
(BioRad) and a Chemdoc image analyzer (BioRad).
Statistics. The mean values±s.e.m. were calculated and plotted using GraphPad
Prism software (GraphPad Software). One-way ANOVA test was performed to
determine statistical significance, which is indicated in the graphs using a Michelin
grade scale ***Po0.001, **Po0.01 and *Po0.05.
