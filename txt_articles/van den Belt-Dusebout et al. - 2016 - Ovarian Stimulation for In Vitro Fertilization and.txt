IMPORTANCE Previous studies of breast cancer risk after in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment
were inconclusive due to limited follow-up.
OBJECTIVE To assess long-term risk of breast cancer after ovarian stimulation for IVF.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Historical cohort (OMEGA study) with complete
follow-up through December 2013 for 96% of the cohort. The cohort included 19 158 women
who started IVF treatment between 1983 and 1995 (IVF group) and 5950 women starting
other fertility treatments between 1980 and 1995 (non-IVF group) from all 12 IVF clinics in
the Netherlands. The median age at end of follow-up was 53.8 years for the IVF group and
55.3 years for the non-IVF group.
EXPOSURES Information on ovarian stimulation for IVF, other fertility treatments, and
potential confounders was collected from medical records and through mailed
questionnaires.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incidence of invasive and in situ breast cancers in women
who underwent fertility treatments was obtained through linkage with the Netherlands
Cancer Registry (1989-2013). Breast cancer risk in the IVF group was compared with risks in
the general population (standardized incidence ratios [SIRs]) and the non-IVF group (hazard
ratios [HRs]).
RESULTS Among 25 108 women (mean age at baseline, 32.8 years; mean number of IVF
cycles, 3.6), 839 cases of invasive breast cancer and 109 cases of in situ breast cancer
occurred after a median follow-up of 21.1 years. Breast cancer risk in IVF-treated women was
not significantly different from that in the general population (SIR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.93-1.09])
and from the risk in the non-IVF group (HR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.86-1.19]). The cumulative
incidences of breast cancer at age 55 were 3.0% for the IVF group and 2.9% for the non-IVF
group (P = .85). The SIR did not increase with longer time since treatment (�20 years) in the
IVF group (0.92 [95% CI, 0.73-1.15]) or in the non-IVF group (1.03 [95% CI, 0.82-1.29]). Risk
was significantly lower for those who underwent 7 or more IVF cycles (HR, 0.55 [95% CI,
0.39-0.77]) vs 1 to 2 IVF cycles and after poor response to the first IVF cycle (HR, 0.77 [95%
CI, 0.61-0.96] for <4 vs �4 collected oocytes).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among women undergoing fertility treatment in the
Netherlands between 1980 and 1995, IVF treatment compared with non-IVF treatment was
not associated with increased risk of breast cancer after a median follow-up of 21 years.
Breast cancer risk among IVF-treated women was also not significantly different from that in
the general population. These findings are consistent with absence of a significant increase in
long-term risk of breast cancer among IVF-treated women.

F
ordecades,breastcancerhasbeenthemostcommonma-
lignancy among women worldwide.1 Both exogenous
and endogenous estrogens and progestogens have been
shown to affect breast cancer risk.2-4 Since in vitro fertiliza-
tion(IVF)procedurestemporarilycausedecreasedestradioland
progesterone levels (during down-regulation of the natural
cycle),5 as well as strongly elevated levels6 (during stimula-
tion phase), IVF might influence breast cancer risk.
Knowledge about possible long-term influences of ovar-
ian stimulation for IVF on breast cancer risk is still scarce be-
cause use of IVF did not become widespread until the late
1980s.7,8 A meta-analysis reported inconclusive results regard-
ing the effect of ovarian
stimulation for IVF on
breast cancer risk,9 but
most studies had a rela-
tively short follow-up and
lacked subfertile compari-
songroups.Becauseofthe
high incidence of breast
cancer and the large num-
bers of women undergoing ovarian stimulation for IVF, even a
small risk increase would have important public health impli-
cations. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to quan-
tify the long-term risk of breast cancer in a nationwide cohort
of women treated with ovarian stimulation for IVF or other fer-
tility treatments. A secondary aim was to examine the sepa-
rate associations of subfertility diagnosis and of IVF treatment
components with breast cancer risk.
Methods
In 1995 and 1996, a historical cohort (OMEGA study) of women
treated for subfertility was identified, comprising women who
started ovarian stimulation for IVF between 1983 and 1995 in
one of the 12 IVF clinics in the Netherlands (IVF group) and a
comparison group of women who started fertility treatments
other than IVF between 1980 and 1995 in 4 clinics (non-IVF
group). Most women in the non-IVF group underwent tubal
surgery, (low-dose ovarian stimulation) intrauterine insemi-
nation (IUI), hormonal treatments (eg, clomiphene), or with-
drewfromthewaitinglistforIVF.Womeninthenon-IVFgroup
were included with similar subfertility diagnoses as women in
the IVF group. The institutional ethical committee of each of
theIVFclinicsapprovedthestudyprocedures,whichhavebeen
previously described.10-12
Between 1997 and 2000, eligible women were invited to
complete a risk factor questionnaire and to provide written in-
formed consent for medical record data abstraction and future
linkage with disease registries. The questionnaire ascertained
eachparticipant’
sreproductivehistory,fertilitytreatments,use
of exogenous hormones, lifestyle factors, and family history of
cancer.Trainedabstractorsregisteredsubfertilitydiagnoses,fer-
tility-improving surgical procedures, and, for each IVF or IUI
cycle, date, dosage, and type of fertility drugs, number of
oocytescollected,andoutcomesfrommedicalrecords.In2012,

mately 23% of the cohort, subfertility diagnosis and number of

nonresponding women were linked with the Dutch Municipal
Personal Records Database, yielding information on vital sta-
tus, parity, and age at first birth for 99% of the cohort through
August 2013.
For95.7%ofthecohort,cancerincidenceintheperiod1989
through December 2013 was ascertained from the population-
based Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR)12,13 because 4.3% of
women declined linkage. For cases of invasive breast cancer
and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), date of diagnosis and his-
tology were obtained.
Statistical Analysis
Because the Netherlands Cancer Registry did not fully cover
the Netherlands before 1989, observation time for each par-
ticipant started on January 1989, the date of first IVF treat-
ment (IVF group), or the date of the first clinic visit for sub-
fertility evaluation (non-IVF group), whichever came last.
Person-years of observation were calculated through Decem-
ber 31, 2013, date of any cancer diagnosis, or date of death,
whichever came first. Women originally included in the non-
IVFgroup,whosubsequentlyreceivedIVF,contributedperson-
time to the non-IVF group until the date of first IVF treat-
ment, then switched to the exposed group from this date
(according to standard cohort methodology regarding time-
dependent allocation of person-years in case of changing
exposure).14 Women with a cancer diagnosis before 1989 or co-
hort entry were excluded.

group and the non-IVF group was compared with incidence

Key Points
Question What is the long-term risk of breast cancer after ovarian
stimulation for in vitro fertilization (IVF)?
Findings In this cohort study that included 25 108 women who
underwent fertility treatments with a median follow-up of 21.1
years, breast cancer risk in IVF-treated women was not
significantly different from that in the general population or in
women who underwent other fertility treatments.
Meaning These findings are consistent with the absence of a
significant increase in long-term risk of breast cancer among
IVF-treated women.

multiplied by 100 000. For the general population, breast can-
cer incidence rates per 100 000 women were calculated by di-
viding the observed numbers by the number of person-years,
divided by 100 000, and multiplied by the observed:expected
ratio in the full cohort.
Cumulative incidences of breast cancer at age 55 years
were calculated for the IVF group and the non-IVF group
using the life-table method. Cox proportional hazards mod-
els were used to compare breast cancer risk between the IVF
and the non-IVF groups, adjusting for confounders. Hazard
ratios (HRs) for breast cancer and 95% CIs were calculated
with cumulative numbers of IVF cycles and births as time-
dependent variables, using age (in years) as time scale. All
other variables were included as fixed variables. None of the
variables violated the proportional hazards assumption
when evaluating log-minus-log plots. Confounders were
defined as factors changing the risk estimate for the expo-
sure of interest by 10% or more in a model including the
potential confounder(s) and the variable of interest. Con-
founders were tested in models restricted to women who
responded to the questionnaire since information on a num-
ber of potential confounders was missing for nonresponders.
Selected confounders were subsequently included in all
analyses including both responders and nonresponders.
Dose-response associations were examined with total
number of IVF cycles, number of follicle-stimulating hor-
mone (FSH) and human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) am-
pules, and numbers of oocytes collected. Since women in the
IVF group and the non-IVF group could have been treated with
mild ovarian stimulation necessary for IUI, dose-response as-
sociationsincludingthetotalnumberofIUIandIVFcycleswere
also investigated. Furthermore, the IVF group was also com-
pared with a reference group of women who did not receive
IVF, IUI, clomiphene, or any other fertility drug during the ob-
servation period. Effect modification of the association be-
tweenIVFtreatmentandbreastcancerriskbyotherbreastcan-
cer risk factors, especially parity, was examined. In all main
analyses, missing values were included as a separate cat-
egory. Four sensitivity analyses were performed: (1) with in-
vasive breast cancer and DCIS as a combined outcome vari-
able (75% of the cohort was ≥50 years at end of follow-up, the
age at which population screening in the Netherlands starts);
(2) in the cohort restricted to women who started fertility treat-
mentfrom1989onward;(3)withmultipleimputationformiss-
ing covariate data; and (4) with a propensity score–adjusted
analysis.16-20
The total numbers of IVF and IUI cycles and the subfertil-
ity diagnosis were imputed with multivariate imputation by
chained equations.16,17 The imputation model was a negative
binomial regression for numbers of IVF and IUI cycles and a
nominallogisticregressionforsubfertilitydiagnosis.Themodel
included year of first IVF treatment or first visit to a gynecolo-
gist; age at first IVF treatment or first visit to a gynecologist;
and age at menarche, age at first birth, parity, number of births,
body mass index, IVF clinic, total number of IUI cycles, sub-
fertility diagnosis, breast cancer incidence, and the cumula-
tivehazardcalculatedfromaCoxproportionalhazardsmodel.18
For women with an unknown number of IVF cycles, the total
numberofIVFcycleswasimputedandtimesinceentryforeach
cycle was assigned based on the mean times among women
with observed number of cycles and stratified by the number
of births (0, 1, or >1). The imputation process was repeated 10
times to create 10 full data sets. The Rubin rule was used to
combine results of the models fitted to these 10 data sets.19
The propensity to undergo IVF treatment was calculated
using a mixed-effects logistic model20 with random intercept
and fixed effects for the same variables included in the impu-
tation model (previously reported in this section). The pro-
pensity score was added to the Cox model as a continuous co-
variate to adjust the IVF treatment effect for confounding. The
goodness-of-fit of the propensity score model, based on the
McFadden pseudo R2, was 0.31, which is an excellent fit.21
Trend tests were based on the P value of the category-
specific mean as a continuous variable.14 All tests of statisti-
cal significance were 2-sided and a P value of less than .05 was
considered statistically significant. Data were analyzed with
Stata version 11.
Results
Of19 861womenintheIVFgroupand6604womeninthenon-
IVF group, 1015 were excluded because of invalid addresses
and 71 were excluded because of cancer diagnoses before be-
fore 1989 or cohort entry (including 3 breast cancers). Thus,
19 275 women in the IVF group and 6078 women in the non-
IVF group were sent questionnaires; 64.2% responded
(Figure).22 Medical records of 15 007 women were ab-
stracted. The analytic study cohort consisted of 25 108 wom-
en;19 158womenintheIVFgroupand5950womeninthenon-
IVF group (Figure).22 In the description of the cohort, 952
women who were originally included in the non-IVF group but
subsequently received IVF in another clinic were included in
the IVF group (Table 1).
Population Characteristics
Table 1 lists the population characteristics by IVF exposure sta-
tus. Women in the non-IVF group had a slightly longer fol-
low-up duration after start of treatment (median, 23.5 years)
than women in the IVF group (median, 20.7 years) and were
older at end of follow-up (median age 55.3 years) than women
in the IVF group (53.8 years) due to the inclusion of women
seeking fertility treatment before the introduction of IVF treat-
ment to yield sufficient numbers of non-IVF controls. Thirty-
eight percent of women who received IVF treatment re-
mained nulliparous vs 28% of the non-IVF group. The mean
age at baseline was 32.8 years and the mean number of IVF
cycles was 3.6 (Table 1). IVF stimulation regimens used in the

cent of breast cancers were diagnosed before age 51 years.
Comparisons With External Reference Rates
Breast cancer risks were not increased in the IVF group (SIR,
1.01 [95% CI, 0.93-1.09]) or the non-IVF group (SIR, 1.00 [95%
CI, 0.88-1.15]) compared with the Dutch general population
(Table 2). The SIR did not increase with longer time since treat-
ment, neither in the IVF group (SIR, 0.92 for ≥20 years [95%
CI, 0.73-1.15]) nor in the non-IVF group (SIR, 1.03 for ≥20 years
[95% CI, 0.82-1.29]). The actual rates of breast cancer per
100 000 women were 163.5 for the IVF group and 167.2 for the
non-IVF group as compared with 163.3 for the general popu-
lation. The SIRs did not significantly differ by age at first treat-
ment. The SIR was significantly decreased for nulliparous
women (SIR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.76-0.97]) but significantly in-
creased for parous women (SIR, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.02-1.20])
(P < .001). The SIRs for breast cancer and DCIS combined were
1.01 (95% CI, 0.93-1.08) for the IVF group, and 0.98 (95% CI,
0.86-1.11) for the non-IVF group (P = .70) (Table 2).
Internal Comparisons
The cumulative incidences of breast cancer at the age of 55
years were 3.0% for the IVF group and 2.9% for the non-IVF
group (P = .85). As shown in Table 3, breast cancer risk in the
IVF group was not significantly different from the risk in the
non-IVF group (HR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.86-1.19]), adjusting for par-
ity and age at first birth. When comparing the IVF group with
a reference group of women who did not receive IVF, IUI,
clomiphene, or any other fertility drug, the HR was not sig-
nificantly increased (HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.87-1.34] adjusted for
parity).WithintheIVFgroup,breastcancerriskdecreasedwith
more IVF cycles (P for trend = .001), with a significantly
decreased risk with 7 cycles or more (HR, 0.55 [95% CI,

0.39-0.77]) compared with 1-2 IVF cycles. The HR for number
of FSH and hMG ampules showed a similar significant trend,
whereas the HR for number of IVF and IUI cycles combined
didnot.Breastcancerriskwassignificantlydecreased(HR,0.77
[95% CI, 0.61-0.96]) after poor response to the first IVF cycle
(<4 collected oocytes) vs normal response (≥4 collected oo-
cytes). Within normal responders, breast cancer risk did not
significantly differ according to number of collected oocytes.
Breast cancer risk was not associated with subfertility diag-
nosis or (type of) luteal phase support.
The risks according to parity showed a similar pattern as
the SIRs. In the entire cohort, parous women had a signifi-
cantly increased risk compared with nulliparous women (HR,
1.35 [95% CI, 1.16-3.73]). Women who were 35 years or older
at first birth had a significantly increased risk compared with
women younger than 25 years at first birth (HR, 1.73 [95% CI,
1.30-2.30] for age 35-39 years and HR, 2.52 [95% CI, 1.71-3.73]
for age 40 years or older).
When stratifying by timing of first birth, the risks of breast
cancer for IVF vs no IVF were equal among women who were
alreadyparousbeforeIVF(HR,1.07[95%CI,0.80-1.41]),among
women who had their first birth after IVF (HR, 1.06 [95% CI,
0.83-1.36]), and were not significantly different from women
who remained nulliparous (Table 4). No significant differ-
ences in HRs for IVF vs no IVF were observed when stratify-
ing analyses by attained age (>50 vs ≤50 years), by age at start-
ing treatment (<30 vs 30-35 years and ≥36 years), or by time
since treatment (<10 vs 10-19 and ≥20 years).
In analyses stratified by parity, breast cancer risk de-
creased with more IVF cycles among parous women (P for
trend = .007), but not among nulliparous women (eTable 2 in
the Supplement). Also, among parous women, breast cancer
riskdecreasedsignificantlywithfeweroocytescollectedatfirst

Discussion
In this study of women undergoing fertility treatment in the
Netherlands from 1980-1995 with a median follow-up of 21
years, breast cancer risk after IVF was not increased when
compared with the general population or with a subfertile
non-IVF comparison group. The risk did not differ by type of
fertility drugs or subfertility diagnosis and was not increased
at 20 or more years after IVF treatment. Women with 7 or
more IVF cycles had a significantly decreased risk compared
with women treated with 1 to 2 IVF cycles (HR, 0.55 [95% CI,
0.39-0.77]). Poor response to the first IVF cycle was associ-
ated with decreased breast cancer risk (HR, 0.77 [95% CI,

0.61-0.96] for <4 vs ≥4 collected oocytes). Parous women
had a higher breast cancer risk than nulliparous women,
especially when they were 35 years or older at first birth.
The results of the current study are consistent with re-
cent reviews that reported no increased breast cancer risk af-
ter IVF,9,25,26 and are based on a median follow-up of 21.1 years
compared with a mean of 8 years9 and 16 years27 in prior stud-
ies. The most recent review and meta-analysis comprised 576
incident breast cancer cases among women exposed to IVF
from 8 studies, of which only 3 compared IVF-treated women
with infertile women not treated with IVF.27-29 In the largest
previous study of 87 403 Danish subfertile women (mean fol-
low-up, 8 years), breast cancer risk was not significantly dif-
ferent after treatment with or without ovarian stimulation.29
However,severalstudiesobservedincreasedbreastcancerrisk
insubgroups,eg,aftermorethan4cycles30or6cyclesofhMG31
or after more than 10 years since treatment.32 Stewart et al
reported increased breast cancer risk among women who
started IVF treatment at younger ages,27 whereas others re-
portedahigherriskforwomenoverage30years33or40years30
at start of IVF. Increased breast cancer risks following IVF have
alsobeenreportedforwomenwhoremainednulliparous34and
for parous women.32 Few epidemiologic studies have had
sufficient power to study the effects of different fertility drugs
used in IVF or effect modification by other risk factors such
as parity.25
Since IVF comprises several phases and treatment
schedules changed over time, unraveling the potentially
opposite effects of several components of the IVF procedure
is challenging. Typically, the first phase in IVF treatment is
down-regulation of a woman’
s natural menstrual cycle with
gonadotropin-releasing hormone, followed by ovarian
stimulation with gonadotropins, causing up to 10-times
higher estradiol and progesterone levels than in natural
menstrual cycles.6 If sufficient follicles have developed,
10 000 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is adminis-

a Values may not sum to 100% because of missing data.
bCalculated using Cox regression analyses—models using age (in years) as time
scale. Numbers of IVF cycles and births are included as time-dependent
variables; all other variables are included as fixed variables. All analyses were
adjusted for age at first birth and number of births because for these variables,
the IVF-specific risks (yes vs no or number of cycles) were changed by more
than 10% when the variables were added to the model, which was not the
case for the other potential confounders (4.5% maximum change): subfertility
diagnosis, type of luteal phase support, clomiphene use, family history of
breast cancer, body mass index, multiple pregnancies, breast feeding, age at
menarche, use of oral contraceptives, and hormonal replacement therapy.
c Includes the major cause of subfertility based on information from medical
records if available and information from questionnaires if no medical record
information was available. Hormonal factors include ovulation disorders,
polycystic ovary syndrome, and premature menopause; nonhormonal factors
include male factor, tubal factor, unexplained, and other factors (eg,
endometriosis and cervical factors). If several diagnoses were registered
without mention of the main diagnosis, the following order was applied:
male factor, tubal factor, hormonal factor or other factor, or unexplained for
main diagnosis.
dBased on the Dutch Municipal Personal Records Database and questionnaires.
Includes all births until end of follow-up. Adjusted HR includes adjustment for
IVF (yes vs no only). Women with unknown parity status (n = 257), including 3
with breast cancer, were excluded.

and the strongly increased levels during ovarian stimulation,
and whether the use of hCG might exert a protective effect
through breast tissue differentiation.35,36 In 2 recent in vitro
studies, FSH, luteinizing hormone, and clomiphene did not in-
creasebreastcellproliferation,whereasestrogenincreasedcell
proliferation of estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer
cells.37,38 Progesterone and hCG both decreased breast cell
proliferation.38 A case-control study reported a decreased risk
ofbreastcancerafterhCGgivenduringinfertilityorweightloss
treatments.39 In our study, women with the highest number
of IVF cycles had the lowest risk of breast cancer. Explana-
tions could be that women treated with more IVF cycles re-
ceived more hCG, had longer periods of down-regulation with
low estradiol and progesterone levels, or because of some in-
herent characteristic of the women that required more IVF
cycles. Women who remained nulliparous had a significantly
lower risk of breast cancer than parous women in contrast with
the established risk increase in nulliparous women in the gen-
eral population. Compared with parous women, nulliparous
women in the cohort more often had a poor response at first
IVF cycle (23% vs 15%; P < .001), which in this study was as-
sociated with a decreased breast cancer risk. In a previous re-
port on this cohort, poor response at first IVF cycle was pre-
dictive for early menopause,11 which reduces the risk of breast
cancer. However, adjustment for poor response did not ma-
terially affect the association between parity and breast can-
cer risk (crude HR, 1.37 [95% CI, 1.18-1.58]; adjusted HR, 1.35
[95% CI, 1.17-1.57]). The higher risk for parous women may also
be due to the temporary increase of breast cancer risk after giv-
ing birth.40 As this increased risk may last 20 to 30 years, many
parous women in the cohort had not yet reached the ages at
which parity would exert a protective effect on breast cancer
risk. Furthermore, the late age at first birth in the cohort (me-
dian, 31.5 years; 75th quartile, 35.0 years) may have precluded
the observation of a reduced risk associated with parity.
Strengths of this study include the large size of the cohort
and the long and complete follow-up, providing sufficient
power for subgroup analyses. Although IVF regimens changed
after 1995, information about long-term cancer risk is impor-
tantbecausemanywomenreceivedIVFtreatmentbefore1995.
Selection bias is unlikely since 96% of the cohort was linked
with the population-based Netherlands Cancer Registry, en-
abling us to also evaluate the risk including DCIS. Further-
more, accurate information on the most important confound-
ers (ie, number of births and age at first birth) was available
for 99% of the cohort (both for responders and nonre-
sponders to the questionnaire).
This study has several limitations. First, several poten-
tial confounding factors, such as subfertility diagnosis, had
high rates of missing data. There was an imbalance with
more missing data in the non-IVF group (33%) than in the
IVF group (16%). However, near complete information was
available on IVF exposure, and the most important potential
confounders (age at first birth and parity). Furthermore,
after adjusting for parity and age at first birth, adjustment
for other potential confounders did not affect risk estimates.
All comparisons of the IVF group with the general popula-
tion and with the non-IVF group yielded similar results,
including sensitivity analyses in subgroups, analyses with
multiple imputation of missing covariate data, or propensity
score adjustment.
Second, age at menopause and menopausal status at end
offollow-upwereunknownformostwomenbecausefewwere
postmenopausal at questionnaire completion between 1997
and 2000. If IVF-treated women reach earlier menopause than
women in the general population, breast cancer risk after IVF
may have been underestimated. However, adjustment for
number of collected oocytes at first IVF cycle (with low num-
bers of oocytes as a proxy for early menopause11) did not affect
the HR estimates for IVF. Furthermore, results were compa-
rable in analyses stratified by age (younger than and older than
50 years).
Third, for women who received fertility treatment before
the Netherlands Cancer Registry fully covered the Nether-
lands (1989), person-years were included from 1989 onward
because cancer incidence before 1989 was only known for
responding women and not for nonresponding women. This
lag between start of treatment and start of observation time
for women treated between 1980 and 1988 might have influ-
enced the results if cancers diagnosed between 1980 and
1989 were missed. However, with 71 responding women
reporting any cancer (including 3 breast cancers) before 1989
or cohort entry and assuming equal breast cancer rates in
nonresponding women, approximately 50 nonresponding
women would have developed any cancer (including 2
breast cancers) before 1989 or cohort entry. Thus, the num-
ber of potentially missed early-onset breast cancers is too
small to have influenced the results. A sensitivity analysis
restricted to women starting treatment from 1989 onward,
to examine whether the results were influenced by exclusion
of person-years between exposure and 1989, had similar
results to the main analysis.
Fourth, results are largely based on IVF treatment proto-
cols used until 1995. During the study period, the number of
IVF cycles and, consequently, the number of ampules of
gonadotropins used increased until 1990 and decreased
thereafter. Because more recent IVF regimens largely consist
of protocols with antagonists and shorter periods of down-
regulation (possibly associated with less risk reduction), and
improved success rates (associated with fewer cycles), it is
uncertain how study results generalize to more contempo-
rary IVF treatment. Furthermore, because only 14% of the
cohort had reached age 60 years, follow-up is necessary to
evaluate postmenopausal breast cancer risk after ovarian
stimulation for IVF.
Conclusions
Among women undergoing fertility treatment in the Nether-
lands between 1980 and 1995, the use of IVF compared with
non-IVF treatment was not associated with increased risk of
breast cancer after a median follow-up of 21 years. These find-
ings are consistent with the absence of a significant increase
in the long-term risk of breast cancer among women treated
with these IVF regimens.
