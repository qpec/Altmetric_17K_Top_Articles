ABSTRACT
Objectives To examine the prospective associations
between consumption of sugar sweetened beverages,
artificially sweetened beverages, and fruit juice with
type 2 diabetes before and after adjustment for
adiposity, and to estimate the population attributable
fraction for type 2 diabetes from consumption of
sugar sweetened beverages in the United States and
United Kingdom.
Design Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Data sources and eligibility PubMed, Embase,
Ovid, and Web of Knowledge for prospective studies
of adults without diabetes, published until February
2014. The population attributable fraction was
estimated in national surveys in the USA, 2009–10
(n=4729 representing 189.1 million adults without
diabetes) and the UK, 2008–12 (n=1932 representing
44.7 million).
Synthesis methods Random effects meta-analysis
and survey analysis for population attributable fraction
associated with consumption of sugar sweetened
beverages.
Results Prespecified information was extracted from 17
cohorts (38 253 cases/10 126 754 person years). Higher
consumption of sugar sweetened beverages was
associated with a greater incidence of type 2 diabetes,
by 18% per one serving/day (95% confidence interval
9% to 28%, I2 for heterogeneity=89%) and 13%
(6% to 21%, I2=79%) before and after adjustment for
adiposity; for artificially sweetened beverages, 25%
(18% to 33%, I2=70%) and 8% (2% to 15%,
I2=64%); and for fruit juice, 5% (−1% to 11%,
I2=58%) and 7% (1% to 14%, I2=51%). Potential
sources of heterogeneity or bias were not evident for
sugar sweetened beverages. For artificially sweetened
beverages, publication bias and residual confounding
were indicated. For fruit juice the finding was non-
significant in studies ascertaining type 2 diabetes
objectively (P for heterogeneity=0.008). Under specified
assumptions for population attributable fraction, of 20.9
million events of type 2 diabetes predicted to occur over
10 years in the USA (absolute event rate 11.0%), 1.8
million would be attributable to consumption of sugar
sweetened beverages (population attributable fraction
8.7%, 95% confidence interval 3.9% to 12.9%); and of
2.6 million events in the UK (absolute event rate 5.8%),
79 000 would be attributable to consumption of sugar
sweetened beverages (population attributable fraction
3.6%, 1.7% to 5.6%).
Conclusions Habitual consumption of sugar
sweetened beverages was associated with a greater
incidence of type 2 diabetes, independently of adiposity.
Although artificially sweetened beverages and fruit juice
also showd positive associations with incidence of type 2
diabetes, the findings were likely to involve bias. None
the less, both artificially sweetened beverages and fruit
juice were unlikely to be healthy alternatives to sugar
sweetened beverages for the prevention of type 2
diabetes. Under assumption of causality, consumption of
sugar sweetened beverages over years may be related to
a substantial number of cases of new onset diabetes.
INTRODUCTION
The health effects of sugar sweetened beverages,
artificially sweetened beverages, and fruit juice have
received considerable attention from scientific and
public communities. The consumption of sugar
sweetened beverages is likely to contribute to an
increase in obesity and the development of type 2
diabetes.1–5
Artificially sweetened beverages and
fruit juice are candidate alternatives to sugar swee-
tened beverages, but their prospective associations
with type 2 diabetes have not yet been well estab-
lished because only a few studies have examined
the associations, of which potential bias has been
debated.5–9
Each of these beverage types has been investi-
gated and reviewed for prospective associations
with incident type 2 diabetes.4–9 A few quantitative
reviews were available, but one aggregated studies
that did and did not adjust for obesity status4 9 and
the other separated such studies ad hoc only for
those of sugar sweetened beverages and not for
those of artificially sweetened beveraor fruit juice.5
It is crucial to better characterise the influence of
adiposity because obesity can directly cause type 2
diabetes and thus mediate an association between
consumption of sugar sweetened beverages and
type 2 diabetes;4 5 and because obesity can be a
confounder by altering dietary habits and con-
founding an association between beverage con-
sumption
and
incident
type
2
diabetes.8 10
Previous studies indeed reported that obese indivi-
duals tend to consume more sugar sweetened and
artificially sweetened beverages and less fruit juice
than leaner individuals.6 10 11

 the growing interest in a policy intervention to reduce the con-
sumption of sugar sweetened beverages at a population level,12
13 14 no study has translated a prospective association between
consumption of sugar sweetened beverages and type 2 diabetes
into a measure of its population level impact, including popula-
tion attributable fraction, in a contemporary population.
W
e therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis
of prospective studies to test whether or not habitual consump-
tion of sugar sweetened beverages, artificially sweetened bev-
erages, or fruit juice would be associated with the incidence of
type 2 diabetes. W
e specifically aimed to meta-analyse the asso-
ciations with and without adjustment for adiposity, because the
association may be both mediated and confounded by this
factor. To provide policy relevant measures, we then used the
result of the meta-analysis for sugar sweetened beverages to esti-
mate the population attributable fraction for the 10 year risk of
developing type 2 diabetes due to consumption of sugar swee-
tened beverages in contemporary populations of the United
States and United Kingdom, where approximately half of each
population
in
recent
years
consumed
sugar
sweetened
beverages.1 10
METHODS
Study searches and selection
Following the PRISMA guidelines15 and the protocol (not regis-
tered, available on request), we identified relevant studies
through hand searches and systematic searches of four databases
on 31 May 2013 (updated on 10 February 2014): PubMed,
Embase, Ovid, and W
eb of Knowledge. Search terms included
those related to types of beverages, diabetes, and prospective
study design (see supplementary information for details). Time
and language of publications were not restricted. After the
removal of duplicates, one author (FI) screened the articles on
the basis of the titles and abstracts and three authors (FI, LO’C,
and ZY) independently reviewed them in duplicate. W
e consid-
ered studies to be eligible for inclusion if they were of a pro-
spective design, assessed the consumption of beverages and
incident type 2 diabetes, and recruited adults free of diabetes
and aged 18 years or older. W
e also considered a follow-up of
at least two years on average because incidence of diabetes
could alter approximately two years after modification of
lifestyle.16 17
Data extraction and quality assessment
W
e extracted information in a standardised manner in duplicate,
including baseline personal information such as body mass
index, and duration of follow-up, exclusion criteria, sample size,
loss to follow-up, assessments of beverage consumption and
incident type 2 diabetes, types of beverage consumed, measures
of prospective associations with 95% confidence intervals, cov-
ariates evaluated, and sources of funding. W
e extracted measures
of associations that were the most adjusted for sociodemo-
graphic and lifestyle factors, with and without further adjust-
ment for adiposity measures. Although adjustment for total
energy intake is important to assess,4 6 in this meta-analysis we
used estimates adjusted for total energy whenever possible for
parsimony and potentials for energy adjustment to reduce con-
founding and measurement errors.18 W
e extracted estimates
stratified by age, sex, and adiposity measures, if reported, to use
in meta-regression to assess heterogeneity. Additional informa-
tion on study design and quality was also obtained from identi-
fied articles as well as from relevant articles of identified
cohorts.
W
e contacted authors of identified articles to request add-
itional information if the article did not report two types of esti-
mates before and after adjustment for adiposity, based on either
categorical or continuous analysis for sugar sweetened bev-
erages, artificially sweetened beverages, and fruit juice separately.
When we contacted authors we requested estimates before and
after adjustment for adiposity based on both continuous and cat-
egorical variables of each beverage consumed, and we requested
estimates based on longer follow-up if available. In addition we
contacted authors of cohorts that did not meet eligibility criteria
but could be eligible on the provision of additional information
(see supplementary table S1).
W
e examined risks of bias in concordance with the Cochrane
tools, including a Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool for non-
randomised studies of interventions.19–21 Seven domains were
assessed: confounding, selection, exposure measurement, mis-
classification over time, missing data, outcome measurement,
and selective reporting. Bias specific to this meta-analysis
included the likelihood of misclassifying sugar sweetened fruit
drink as fruit juice (for example, fruit punch). Sources of bias
were evaluated by using meta-regression for each as a potential
source of heterogeneity, meta-analysis excluding studies with a
certain type of bias, or meta-analysis incorporating quantitative
measures of bias (see supplementary information). Overall
quality of evidence was assessed based on study quality, results
from sensitivity analysis, and principles of the grades of recom-
mendation,
assessment,
development,
and
evaluation
(GRADE).22 One author (FI) first summarised the results of bias
assessment and quality of overall evidence and these results
were discussed among the other authors (FI, LOC, YZ, and
NGF) for consensus.
Meta-analysis
W
e used Stata 13.1 for analyses (α two sided P=0.05, unless
indicated). Statistical details are described in the supplementary
information. Each of sugar sweetened beverages, artificially
sweetened beverages, and fruit juice was considered as the main
exposure. W
e defined sugar sweetened beverages as any swee-
tened beverages, including sugar sweetened fruit juice, not pre-
sented as diet or non-caloric beverages. Artificially sweetened
beverages included low caloric soft drinks as reported in each
study. Fruit juice was defined as 100% fruit juice, or fruit juice
assessed separately from fruit drinks. W
e standardised measures
of associations to relative risk per one serving/day of beverage
consumption, after we confirmed that this unit was the most fre-
quently used in studies. Because volume per serving was specific
to a population, ranging from 237 mL (one cup) to 355 mL (12
oz) (median across publications=250 mL/day), we repeated
meta-analysis to estimate the relative risk for each 250 mL/day.
W
e converted odds ratios, if reported, to relative risks.23 If a
study reported categorical estimates only, they were combined
to obtain a single dose-response estimate.24 If only stratified esti-
mates
were
reported,
we
merged
them
by
fixed
effects
meta-analysis to derive a cohort specific estimate, assuming con-
sistency of associations within a cohort.
W
e performed random effects meta-analysis as prespecified,
assuming that biological effects of beverages in different popula-
tions would vary randomly at least by processing and compos-
ition of beverages. The heterogeneity of associations was
expressed by I.2 25 For each of the beverages of interest, we esti-
mated relative risks before and after adjustment for adiposity
measures. To assess a magnitude of overall confounding, we
additionally estimated crude relative risks without any adjust-
ment. Non-linear associations were additionally evaluated by

 cubic spline meta-analysis for which we used available categor-
ical estimates.24
In observational studies, within person variability of exposure
can cause bias.26–30 As performed previously,26–32 we compiled
within person variation of beverage consumption in each study
and adjusted for them to estimates of each study. Uncertainty in
self reported diagnosis of type 2 diabetes was also calibrated for
estimates from studies without objective information on inci-
dence of type 2 diabetes.33 To compute relative risks adjusted
for within person dietary variation and uncertainty of type 2
diabetes ascertainment, we pooled the estimates after study spe-
cific calibration.
Meta-regression was used to assess if heterogeneity of associa-
tions across studies depended on population demographics,
study
characteristics,
and
indicators
of
errors
or
bias.
Publication status (peer reviewed or not), selective reporting
(yes or no), and mutual adjustment for three beverage types
were evaluated after we identified studies with those character-
istics. Stratified meta-analysis was performed by each variable
that predicted heterogeneity (P<0.01) and by prespecified vari-
ables: age, sex, body mass index, and study location. In explora-
tory analysis using multiple variables of study specific factors,
we reassessed I2 as a magnitude of unexplained heterogeneity.
Publication bias was assessed by Egger’s test, with a contour
enhanced funnel plot, and ‘trim and fill’ analysis.34 If publica-
tion bias was indicated, we adjusted summary estimates for the
bias.34 Robustness of summary findings was examined by sensi-
tivity analyses: influence analysis,32 fixed effects meta-analysis,
analysis using millilitres per day as a unit, analysis without
studies with a high overall risk of bias, and analysis incorporat-
ing measures of uncertainty in adjustment for within person
dietary variations and diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.35
Adiposity is likely to confound an association of beverage
consumption with type 2 diabetes, particularly in research on
artificially sweetened beverages.6 8 10 11
Because of imperfect
measurement of adiposity in an epidemiological study,36 adjust-
ment for adiposity was likely to be insufficient, as discussed
previously.3 6 32 37–41 Thus, to assess if such residual confound-
ing would be substantial, we performed simulation analysis to
examine the influence of the bias.42
Type 2 diabetes risk attributable to sugar sweetened
beverages in USA and UK
W
e estimated the risks of type 2 diabetes attributable to con-
sumption of sugar sweetened beverages over 10 years in the
USA
and
UK.43 44
These
countries
contributed
to
the
meta-analysis to the largest extent and provided publically avail-
able data on diets and risk factors for type 2 diabetes: the US
national health and nutrition examination survey, 2009–1045
and the UK national diet and nutrition survey, 2008–12.46 The
recent cycle was selected for greater generalisability to recent
populations. Selecting adults aged 20 years or more and without
prevalent diabetes, we analysed 4729 US adults and 1932 UK
adults. Accounting for sampling weight, 189.1 million US adults
and 44.7 million UK adults were represented.
W
e estimated the population attributable fraction by applying
a Cochrane Collaboration algorithm to survey data.43 44
W
e
first estimated habitual consumption of sugar sweetened bev-
erages based on 24 hour recalls in the USA and four day food
records in the UK. Then we estimated the 10 year risk of type 2
diabetes based on a risk prediction algorithm developed and
validated in each country.47 48 The predicted risk for each indi-
vidual was considered as an “assumed control risk”44 if the
current consumption of sugar sweetened beverages would
remain constant. Then we calculated an alternative risk if the
consumption of sugar sweetened beverages would become zero,
calculating assumed control risk×(1/relative risk per serving/
day)×observed sugar sweetened beverages servings/day. The dif-
ference between the two risk estimates represented a risk attrib-
utable to consumption of sugar sweetened beverages. Using the
risk estimates, sampling weights, and a population size, we esti-
mated the absolute numbers of events over 10 years, events
attributable to consumption of sugar sweetened beverages (abso-
lute risk reduction44), and population attributable fraction (the
proportion of events attributable to consumption of sugar swee-
tened beverages). The estimation assumed causality and no
change in individuals’ characteristics over time. Validation of 10
year risk prediction was performed in the US survey, in which
we predicted diabetes prevalence in 2009–10 by using data col-
lected in 1999–2000. Sensitivity analysis was performed to esti-
mate the population attributable fraction by varying relative
risks and accounting for uncertainty. Further details are pre-
sented in the supplementary information.
RESULTS
After the removal of duplicates, we identified 1937 articles,
reviewed 33 in full text, and identified 21 articles of 16 cohorts
as being eligible for this meta-analysis (see supplementary figure
S1). W
e obtained unpublished information on one cohort from
a
publication
that
did
not
meet
eligibility
criteria
(see
supplementary table S1).22 Finally, we evaluated data from 17
cohorts (table 1 )11
39–41 49–65 comprising 38 253 cases of type
2 diabetes over 10 126 756 person years in total. No study or
publication was funded by industry.
The
quality
of
the
studies
has
been
examined
(see
supplementary table S2). Methods of assessing diets and ascer-
taining type 2 diabetes and validity of these measurements
varied across studies (table 1 and supplementary table S3). W
e
identified potential bias in the quantitative results for six
cohorts based on at least one of the following: publication of a

beverages and artificially sweetened beverages.57 64
Selective
reporting might exist in some studies,39
52
55
58
62 64 but it
was unlikely to cause bias—for example, reporting only non-
quantitative results for sugar sweetened beverages in a study
mainly on artificially sweetened beverages.39 Other potential
sources of bias were detected, but we did not consider them to
be substantially influential on overall bias in each study, partly
based on results of sensitivity analyses. No study assessed sub-
types of sugar sweetened beverages, artificially sweetened bev-
erages, or fruit juice, except one that separated beverages by
caffeine content.49
Confounding was likely to exist in all of the studies. As would
be expected, consumers of artificially sweetened beverages tended
to be overweight or obese or hypertensive.11 39 50 59 66 In longi-
tudinal analysis, all studies statistically adjusted for potential con-
founders, such as sociodemographic variables, clinical factors
(family history of diabetes or prevalent diseases), and lifestyle
factors, including diet (see supplementary table S4). None of
these factors was identified as a single cause of confounding,
according to studies assessing influence of potential confounding
in different regression models.11 41 49–51 54 59 61 63–65 However,
a combination of multiple factors was likely to cause confound-
ing (table 2 and supplementary table S4). After adjustment for
multiple potential confounders, the relative risk for sugar

*Ordered in years of baseline assessments. Numbers represent citations. ARIC and JPHS reported results stratified by sex. In meta-analysis, sex stratified estimates were aggregated in advance.
†Diets were assessed repeatedly during follow-up and incorporated in longitudinal analysis. JPHC measured repeatedly but used baseline FFQ only.
‡Biomarkers included any of fasting glucose, two hour glucose by oral glucose tolerance test, and glycated haemoglobin. Records included medical records or other records from registry, not including self reported information. Studies ascertaining cases of
type 2 diabetes by self report involved uncertainty in ascertainment, and thus numbers of cases were revised by a positive predictive value (proportion of verified cases among self reported cases) (see supplementary information and table S3). The
EPIC-InterAct study adopted different methods across participating cohorts, in which no cohort used self reported diagnosis only.
§In ARIC and FOS analyses, sugar sweetened and artificially sweetened beverages were combined. In KIHD, the article described fruit juices, but treated them as sugar sweetened beverages, because more than 90% of fruit juice consumed in Finland in
1980s and 1990s was sweetened with sugars (confirmed by the authors).
¶Considered as having potential bias (see supplementary information and table S2). In each of CARDIA and JPHC, distinct analytic approaches were undertaken in different publications by the same authors. Iowa WHS reported results only in a conference
abstract. E3N presented prospective associations adjusted for crude categorical variables for body mass index, which could cause substantial residual confounding. SCHS presented results without classification between 100% fruit juice and sugar
sweetened fruit juice and had a likelihood of attrition bias by loss of follow-up by deaths (15%). HIPOP-OHP lost 31% of participants during follow-up, which could cause bias due to differential misclassification.

 sweetened beverages was attenuated from 1.25 to 1.18 (32%
change), and for artificially sweetened beverages from 1.48 to
1.25 (43%). By contrast, the point estimate for fruit juice was
shifted upwards, from 0.97 to 1.05.
Beverage consumption and type 2 diabetes
Table 2 summarises the findings from meta-analysis. Higher con-
sumption of sugar sweetened beverages by one serving per day
was associated with an 18% greater incidence of type 2 diabetes
(95% confidence interval 8.8% to 28%; I2=89%) before adjust-
ment for adiposity (figure 1 and table 2). When adjusted for
potential mediation and confounding by adiposity, the associ-
ation was attenuated, with the incidence increased by 13% per
serving/day (5.8% to 21%; I2=79%). In the analysis of artifi-
cially sweetened beverages, in which adiposity was unlikely to
be a mediator, higher consumption of artificially sweetened bev-
erages by one serving per day was associated with a 25% greater
incidence of type 2 diabetes (95% confidence interval 18% to
33%; I2=70%) before adjustment for adiposity. After adjust-
ment, the estimate of 25% greater incidence was attenuated to
8% (2.1% to 15%).
In the analysis of fruit juice, the influence of adjustment for
adiposity was in the direction opposite to that of the analysis
for sugar sweetened beverages and artificially sweetened bev-
erages. The association of fruit juice consumption with incident
type 2 diabetes was strengthened after adjustment for adiposity
measures. Higher consumption of fruit juice by one serving/day
was associated with a 7% greater incidence of type 2 diabetes
(95% confidence interval 0.8% to 14%).
Each of the beverages showed significant non-linear associa-
tions (P>0.05) (supplementary figure
S2).
Calibration
for
within person variation strengthened the association between
each type of beverage and incident type 2 diabetes (figure 1 and
table 2). For example, the relative risk per one serving/day of
sugar sweetened beverages was strengthened, from 1.13 (95%
confidence interval 1.06 to 1.21) to 1.28 (1.12 to 1.46).
Estimates for artificially sweetened beverages were strengthened
similarly. The influence was small for fruit juice, where the rela-
tive risk was shifted only slightly, from 1.07 (1.01 to 1.14) to
1.10 (1.01 to 1.20).
Sensitivity analysis and quality of evidence
None of the study specific factors evaluated could explain hetero-
geneity of results for sugar sweetened beverages and artificially
sweetened beverages (P>0.1) (see supplementary table S5).
Exploratory meta-regression produced an I2 of 23.4% for sugar
sweetened beverages and of 67.8% for artificially sweetened bev-
erages, adjusted for population demographics (age, sex, country,
incidence), body mass index, follow-up duration, and measures
of study quality. The results for fruit juice varied by study design.
While studies assessing self reported type 2 diabetes only showed
a positive association, the significant association disappeared in
studies ascertaining the incidence of type 2 diabetes by medical
records or by blood glucose or glycated haemoglobin level (rela-
tive risk 1.08, 0.97 to 1.20; P for heterogeneity=0.008).
Additionally, studies with repeated measures of diets supported a
null finding (0.98, 0.86 to 1.11; P for heterogeneity=0.068).
These factors of study design explained heterogeneity of the asso-
ciation, reducing I2 from 29% to 0%. Demographic variables and
body mass index did not explain heterogeneity (P>0.14 each),
whereas sugar sweetened beverages, artificially sweetened bev-
erages, and fruit juice were not significantly associated with type
2 diabetes in studies recruiting more men than women or con-
ducted in Asia, with a fewer number of studies than in the main
analysis (supplementary table S5).
Publication bias was not evident by Egger’s test (P>0.05),
except for fruit juice (P=0.03), where estimates with the greater
precision showed stronger associations (figure 2). Trim and fill
indicated publication bias for both sugar sweetened and artifi-
cially sweetened beverages (table 2). In particular, publication
bias could influence inference for artificially sweetened bev-
erages. With adjustment for adiposity, the relative risk per one

1.54) before calibration for publication bias and 1.22 (0.98 to
1.52) after calibration (table 2).
Contour enhanced funnel plots indicated that the findings for
artificially sweetened beverages and fruit juice were not stable
(figure 2). For example, if a study with a relative risk of 0.5 con-
tributed to the meta-analysis, associations of artificially swee-
tened beverages and fruit juice with type 2 diabetes incidence
would not be significant. In influence analysis, positive associa-
tions persisted for sugar sweetened beverages and artificially
sweetened beverages (see supplementary figure S3), whereas a
significant result of fruit juice was not seen after excluding any
single studies supporting the positive association.
The results varied little by methodological assumption (see
supplementary
table
S6),
using
estimates
per
250 mL/day
(median of 17 studies) rather than per serving/day; excluding
studies with a high risk of potential bias or with relatively large
within person dietary variability; and incorporating uncertainty
of within person variability and precision of type 2 diabetes
diagnosis.

null appeared substantial for artificially sweetened beverages

 (see supplementary figure S4). Under a realistic assumption of a
correlation of 0.80 between measured and true adiposity,36 the
association for sugar sweetened beverages was attenuated by
26% (relative risk 1.20, 1.04 to 1.38), for artificially sweetened
beverages was attenuated by 96% (1.01, 0.81 to 1.25), and for
fruit juice was strengthened by 19% (1.12, 1.03 to 1.22).
W
e rated the quality of evidence for sugar sweetened beverages,
artificially sweetened beverages, and fruit juice. The evidence for
sugar sweetened beverages was rated as being of moderate quality.
The main finding rejected the null hypothesis and was likely to
have a small degree of heterogeneity unexplained, a dose-response
relation, and robustness against potential bias or limitations includ-
ing publication bias. W
e rated the evidence for artificially
sweetened beverages and fruit juice to be of low quality. Findings
for artificially sweetened beverages were likely to have publication
bias and residual confounding; and for fruit juice, the positive
association was not stable and varied by study design.
Type 2 diabetes risk attributable to sugar sweetened
beverages
Overall, sugar sweetened beverages were consumed by 54.4% of
people in the USA and 49.4% in the UK. Of a total population,
the mean consumption of sugar sweetened beverages was 284
(SD 412) g/day in the USA and 114 (SD 157) g/day in the UK
(figure 3 and supplementary table S7). Absolute event rates over
10 years from 2010 were estimated to be 11.0% in the USA
(20.9 million events) and 5.8% in the UK (2.6 million events).
Assuming a causal effect of consumption of sugar sweetened
beverages
partly
mediated
by
obesity
status
(adiposity
unadjusted), consumption in the USA would result in 2.6
million excess events of type 2 diabetes over 10 years (popula-
tion attributable fraction 11.9%, 95% confidence interval 7.4%
to 16.5%); and 126 000 excess events in the UK (population
attributable fraction 4.9%, 3.0% to 7.2%). Assuming a causal
effect of consumption of sugar sweetened beverages independ-
ent of obesity status (adiposity adjusted), consumption would
result in 1.8 million excess events in the USA (population attrib-
utable fraction 8.7%, 3.9% to 12.9%) and 79 000 excess events
in the UK (population attributable fraction 3.6%, 1.7% to
5.6%). Younger adults and men would have greater numbers of
type 2 diabetes events related to consumption of sugar swee-
tened beverages than older adults and women, respectively
(figure 3 and supplementary table S7). The greater the uncer-
tainty accounted for, the lesser the precision was computed (see
supplementary figure S5). For example, if I2=50%, the popula-
tion attributable fraction of 11.9% in the USA would have a
95% confidence interval of 5.2% to 18.3%, but remained sig-
nificant from 0 for the relative risks we estimated.
DISCUSSION
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we have produced
summary evidence that habitual consumption of sugar swee-
tened beverages, artificially sweetened beverages, and fruit juice
was prospectively associated with incident type 2 diabetes, inde-
pendently of adiposity. Sensitivity analyses consistently sup-
ported the positive association of sugar sweetened beverages
with incident type 2 diabetes. In contrast, the association
between artificially sweetened beverages or fruit juice and inci-
dent type 2 diabetes was less evident. For artificially sweetened
beverages, potential publication bias and residual confounding
were likely to exist. For fruit juice, the finding seemed to be
unstable and was sensitive to study design. Under assumption of
causality for the association of consumption of sugar sweetened
beverages with incidence of type 2 diabetes, we provided effi-
cacy estimates that over 10 years two million type 2 diabetes
events in the USA and 80 000 in the UK would be related to
consumption of sugar sweetened beverages.
Strengths and limitations of this review
This study has limitations typical of observational studies and
meta-analysis. Residual confounding could exist.37 Confounding
by socioeconomic and dietary factors was not detected to be
strong in published studies. However, measures of these vari-
ables were likely to involve errors such that residual confound-
ing persisted
in individual studies
and
our meta-analysis.
Additionally, lifestyle factors and adiposity could change over
time. The time varying characteristics might not be random and

 could result in bias in an unknown direction. Reverse causality
could also exist because of unmeasured comorbid conditions
and health consciousness that might alter consumption of bev-
erages, particularly artificially sweetened ones, and risk of type
2 diabetes. W
eakness of meta-analysis includes the exclusion of
eligible cohorts for lack of information. Our meta-analysis
included statistical approximation that might involve errors. For
example, we derived dose-response estimates partly from cat-
egorical estimates and odds ratios. Without such approxima-
tions, analysis standardised across different cohorts is of future
interest to characterise associations between various beverages
and risks of type 2 diabetes. Finally, assessments of bias and
quality of evidence involved subjectivity, although we objectively
examined the influence of potential bias in tests for heterogen-
eity and sensitivity analyses.
One strength of this study was in estimating population attrib-
utable fraction for risks of type 2 diabetes related to consump-
tion of sugar sweetened beverages in the USA and UK, using
data on beverage consumption for each individual. While a few
studies estimated how much taxation on sugar sweetened bev-
erages influenced risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes,12–14 no
study examined the population impact by combining estimates
for consumption of sugar sweetened beverages in multiple
populations, predicted the risk of type 2 diabetes by using a vali-
dated algorithm, or provided quantitative evidence on the asso-
ciation of consumption of sugar sweetened beverages with
incidence of type 2 diabetes. However, the population attribut-
able fraction was limited in precision owing to underlying rela-
tive
risks
and
uncertainty
in
generalisability.
The
other
limitations are that we estimated the population attributable
fraction under the assumption of causality, although it has not
been established; and the assumption that there would be no
change over time in lifestyle associated with consumption of
sugar sweetened beverages. Future work should seek to improve
precision of evidence and to characterise efficacy and effective-
ness
of
policy
interventions
for
different
populations.
Generalisability should be explored—for example, for popula-
tions in Central and South America with the highest recorded
per capita sales of sugar sweetened beverages in the world; and
China and India where the highest prevalence of type 2 diabetes
is expected.1 67 To minimise limitations typical of observational
research and understand effectiveness of a policy intervention in
different
populations,
future
research
should
also
include
randomised trials examining people’s health and behaviours and
informing effectiveness.
Interpretation in relation to other studies
Other quantitative reviews have been published recently.4 5 9
None of them quantified the population attributable fraction.
One meta-analysis evaluated the influence of adiposity on the
association of sugar sweetened beverages and type 2 diabetes
based on three studies, but not artificially sweetened beverages
or fruit juice.5 For sugar sweetened beverages, we evaluated a
greater number of type 2 diabetes cases (38 285 v 19 054) and
studies (17 v 3), including bias assessments and sensitivity ana-
lyses. For fruit juice and artificially sweetened beverages, we
evaluated a greater number of studies than previous work (9 v 4
and 12 v 4, respectively) and drew conclusions based on assess-
ment of the influences of adiposity and potential bias that were
found to be important.
The plausibility of our findings deserves discussion. Detrimental
effects of sugar sweetened beverages independent of obesity may
exist. Sugars in sugar sweetened beverages acutely increased blood
glucose levels and have a high glycaemic index (80 to 110/100 of
white bread), a risk factor for type 2 diabetes.68 69 Fructose in
sugar sweetened beverages promotes hepatic lipogenesis and
further insulin resistance.2
Effects of caramels for colouring
beverages,70 caffeine,49 71 phosphoric acid,72 and other constitu-
ents may also exist. These non-glycaemic effects may be present in
artificially sweetened beverages, if such beverages truly increase
the risk of type 2 diabetes. Artificially sweetened beverages might
have effects on hormones, microbiota, and taste preference, but
evidence for these remains weak.6 73 74 Adverse effects of fruit
juice would be present because of its moderately high glycaemic
index (50–80).68 Healthful constituents may exist but decrease
during processing.7 75 This explains why our finding was discord-
ant with the inverse association of consuming fruits as food with
type 2 diabetes.76
Our analysis indicated possible publication bias for the asso-
ciations between artificially sweetened beverages and type 2 dia-
betes. The bias toward a false positive finding would be
plausible according to existing public interest over the health
effects.6
77
The finding at least underscores potential low
quality of evidence and the need for cautious interpretation.
Residual confounding in the finding for artificially sweetened
beverages is also plausible because adults at high risk of type 2

 diabetes preferentially consumed more artificially sweetened
beverages.5 6 8 10 11 36 Confounding in the opposite direction in
the finding for fruit juice is also plausible because leaner adults
at lower risk of type 2 diabetes consumed more fruit juice.10 11
These observations provide research and clinical implications
for better understanding of health seeking behaviours related to
beverage consumption.6 78
Clinical and public health implications
Although causality has not been established, our findings and
available evidence indicate a benefit of reducing the consump-
tion of sugar sweetened beverages for the primary prevention of
type 2 diabetes. In the same context, our findings also imply
that consumption of artificially sweetened beverages or fruit
juice is not likely to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and, thus,
not suitable as a healthy option. None the less, the lower caloric
intake of artificially sweetened beverages may be of clinical
benefit in obese or overweight adults by helping to reduce body
weight.6 78 This effect on body weight should be considered
separately from our study, which could not rule out the effect of
body weight on beverage consumption.8 Additionally, clinical
applications of our finding deserve further appraisal about the
effects of altering beverage consumption on changes in lifestyle
behaviours and on risks of other clinical outcomes.3 6 8
Our findings have strong public health implications. Despite
the limitations of this review, the current consumption of sugar
sweetened beverages was estimated to cause approximately two
million excess events of type 2 diabetes in the USA and 80 000
in the UK over 10 years. This could cost nearly £12.0bn in the
USA and £206m in the UK ($9800 in the USA and $3994 in
the UK per patient,67 $1 (£0.65; €0.91 as of 7 July 2015). In
future, our work on efficacy should be extended to that on
effectiveness to identify needs for interventions. In addition to
observational evidence, trial evidence should be available,
accounting for the effects on cardiometabolic health and life-
style change associated with a possible intervention.8 78 Despite
a population attributable fraction of no more than 20%, effect-
iveness should be evaluated for different populations, as an esti-
mated 592 million adults globally will have type 2 diabetes in
2035.1 67 Additionally, the average population attributable frac-
tion of no more than 20% confirms the importance of modify-
ing multiple lifestyle risk factors rather than a single dietary
component, for the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes. For
artificially sweetened beverages and fruit juice, our findings
inform little benefit of using them as an alternative to sugar
sweetened beverages. In addition, fruit juice consumption
should not be a part of dietary recommendations for greater
consumption of fruits and vegetables, as suggested to limit fruit
juice consumption among children.7 79
Conclusions
Observational cohort studies support that consumption of sugar
sweetened beverages is associated with incident type 2 diabetes,
and independently of adiposity. This finding was stable in sensi-
tivity analyses assessing influence of population characteristics,
potential residual confounding, and publication bias. By con-
trast, although artificially sweetened beverages and fruit juice
showed a positive association with incident type 2 diabetes, the
quality of evidence is limited by potential bias and heterogeneity
by study design. Although causality has not been established and
precision needs to be improved, this study informs the potential
efficacy of reducing the consumption of sugar sweetened bev-
erages
in
a
contemporary
population.
Moreover,
findings
support that neither artificially sweetened beverages nor fruit
juice are suitable alternatives to sugar sweetened beverages for
the prevention of type 2 diabetes.
What is already known on this topic
▸ Current evidence is limited to answer whether or not
consumption of sugar sweetened beverages, artificially
sweetened beverages, and fruit juice is associated with risk
of diabetes after adjustment for obesity status
▸ Despite in the debate of a policy intervention to reduce
consumption of sugar sweetened beverages, no study has
estimated how many incident cases of diabetes may be
caused by consuming sugar sweetened beverages
What this study adds
▸ Habitual consumption of sugar sweetened beverages was
positively associated with incidence of type 2 diabetes,
independently of obesity status
▸ Under an assumption of causality, consumption of sugar
sweetened beverages may be linked to 4–13% of type 2
diabetes incidence in the United States and 2–6% in the
United Kingdom over 10 years, 2010–20
▸ Artificially sweetened beverages and fruit juice were both
positively associated with incident type 2 diabetes, but likely
to involve bias, and seemed not to be healthy options for the
prevention of type 2 diabetes
