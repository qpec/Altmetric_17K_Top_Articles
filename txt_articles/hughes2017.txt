ABSTRACT
Introduction Gastrointestinal infections (GII) can cause
serious ill health and morbidity. Although primarily
transmitted through faecal contamination of food or
water, transmission through sexual activity is well
described, especially among men who have sex with
men (MSM).
Methods We investigated the prevalence of GIIs
among a convenience sample of MSM who were
consecutively diagnosed with rectal Chlamydia
trachomatis (CT) at 12 UK genitourinary medicine clinics
during 10 weeks in 2012. Residual rectal swabs were
coded, anonymised and tested for Shigella,
Campylobacter, Salmonella, shiga toxin-producing
Escherichia coli and enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC)
using a real-time PCR. Results were linked to respective
coded and anonymised clinical and demographic data.
Associations were investigated using Fisher’s exact tests.
Results Of 444 specimens tested, overall GII
prevalence was 8.6% (95% CI 6.3% to 11.6%): 1.8%
(0.9% to 3.6%) tested positive for Shigella, 1.8% (0.9%
to 3.6%) for Campylobacter and 5.2% (3.5% to 7.7%)
for EAEC. No specimens tested positive for Salmonella or
other diarrhoeagenic E. coli pathotypes. Among those
with any GII, 14/30 were asymptomatic (2/7 with
Shigella, 3/6 with Campylobacter and 9/17 with EAEC).
Shigella prevalence was higher in MSM who were HIV-
positive (4.7% (2.1% to 10.2%) vs 0.5%(0.1% to
3.2%) in HIV-negative MSM; p=0.01).
Conclusions In this small feasibility study, MSM with
rectal CT appeared to be at appreciable risk of GII.
Asymptomatic carriage may play a role in sexual
transmission of GII.
INTRODUCTION
Gastrointestinal infections (GII) can cause serious
ill health and morbidity, including diarrhoea, dehy-
dration,
bacteraemia,
Reiter’s
syndrome
and
haemolytic uraemic syndrome. Transmission occurs
through the faecal–oral route and is primarily asso-
ciated with contaminated food or water. Sexual
transmission is well described, especially among
men who have sex with men (MSM), among whom
it is usually associated with exposure through direct
or indirect oroanal contact.1–5
In the last decade, there have been remarkable
changes in the epidemiology of some GII in
England.4 6 7 Diagnoses of non-travel associated
Shigella flexneri, usually associated with travel to
endemic areas, have risen sharply; non-travel asso-
ciated
cases
now
outnumber
travel-associated
cases.6 Control measures have focused on raising
awareness among clinicians and patients to reduce
spread in those with symptoms. However, these
have made little impact on the Shigella spp. epi-
demics.6 It is unclear whether asymptomatic infec-
tion, which is an important characteristic for many
STIs, plays a role in sexual transmission of GII.
The
prevalence,
incidence
and
transmission
dynamics of GII in MSM is poorly understood
because (1) surveillance data reflect the subset with
acute infection presenting to clinical services, (2)
sexual exposure is not routinely recorded for GII
and (3) there is no simple method for routinely
screening MSM for GII. W
e used a convenience
sample of MSM diagnosed with rectal Chlamydia
trachomatis (CT) at selected UK sexual health
clinics to investigate whether rectal swabs from
routine STI screens would make suitable specimens
for GII testing and to provide crude estimates of GII
prevalence in these men. Infection with rectal CT
suggests a history of receptive condomless anal
intercourse and identifies a group potentially at
higher risk of GII from indirect oroanal contact. As
such, MSM with rectal CTare an appropriate popu-
lation for a feasibility study on GII.
METHODS
Study population and study period
W
e used a convenience sample of MSM from a
Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) case-finding
study.8 The LGV study included only MSM who
had been consecutively diagnosed with rectal CT at
12 clinics in the UK (in Brighton, Glasgow, London
and Manchester) between 24 September 2012 and
7 December 2012, except those who had taken any
antibiotics
during
the
previous
6 weeks.8
The
recruiting clinics serve large MSM populations;
they undertake routine testing of MSM for rectal
CT (using clinician or self-taken rectal swabs)
regardless of symptoms and follow up some cases
according
to
UK
guidelines.9

 submitted to the Public Health England (PHE) Reference
Laboratory for CT confirmation and LGV typing.8 Residual
CT-positive specimens were included in the GII study.
Data collection
Data on symptom presentation in study participants were sys-
tematically recorded by clinicians during the consultation and
submitted to PHE through a secure web portal. The proforma
covered CT-related or LGV-related symptoms and included a
free-text field to record non-specific symptoms (eg, diarrhoea,
loose stools).8 Patients presenting with symptoms at any attend-
ance associated with a single STI care episode (typically
2–4 weeks duration) were defined as symptomatic. (In the
original study, only three patients were initially asymptomatic,
but subsequently symptomatic during the same care episode.)
Data on HIV status were available for patients in England
(97%) from the national electronic STI surveillance system.8 10
Unlinked anonymous testing protocol
As the GII testing protocol was not part of patients’ clinical
care, to comply with the Data Protection Act, all residual
specimens were irreversibly unlinked and anonymised prior to
GII testing, a technique originally developed to monitor HIV
prevalence.11 A unique GII study number was assigned to each
specimen and associated clinical data, and a ‘GII study dataset’
created. Patient ID numbers in the GII study dataset were
irreversibly deleted as were GII study numbers in all source
datasets. Clinical data in the GII study dataset were restricted
and summarised to prevent deductive disclosure of patients into
the
following
groups:
(1)
region
of
residence
(London/
non-London), (2) symptom status (symptomatic/asymptomatic),
(3) HIV status (positive/negative), (4) LGV status (positive/nega-
tive). As only one patient presented with symptoms consistent
with GII, GII symptoms were grouped with CT and LGV-related
symptoms.
DNA extraction and GII testing
Residual rectal swabs, which had been tested for CT/LGV as
part of the LGV case-finding study and which had been stored
at −20°C, were used for GII testing. DNA was extracted using
the QIAsymphony DSP DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Specimens were tested for Shigella
sp., Campylobacter sp., Salmonella sp., shiga toxin-producing
Escherichia coli and enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) using a
real-time PCR on a Rotor-Gene (Qiagen). The amplification
parameters were 95°C for 5 min, followed by 95°C for 15 s and
60°C for 60 s. The cycle threshold was set at 0.05 for all
targets. Details of the primers, probes and gene targets are listed
in the web table.
Data analysis
Summary clinical data were linked to the GII PCR test result
using the GII study number. W
e estimated GII prevalence with
95% CIs and used Fisher’s exact tests to compare test results by
patient characteristics, for each GII, and for all GII combined.
Ethical statement
No individual patient consent was required or sought as PHE
has authority to handle patient data for public health monitor-
ing and infection control under section 251 of the UK National
Health Service Act of 2006 (previously section 60 of the Health
and Social Care Act of 2001).
RESULTS
Of 489 stored rectal specimens, 444 (91%) had DNA success-
fully extracted for PCR testing. Of these, 38 (8.5%) tested posi-
tive for any GII: 8 (1.8%) tested positive for Shigella sp., 8
(1.8%) for Campylobacter sp. and 23 (5.2%) for EAEC
(table 1). No specimens tested positive for Salmonella sp. or the
other diarrhoeagenic E. coli pathotypes. One patient was coin-
fected with Shigella sp. and EAEC.
Among those with GII, 30/38 were London residents (8/8
with Shigella sp., 7/8 Campylobacter sp. and 16/23 EAEC infec-
tions), 14/30 were asymptomatic (2/7 with Shigella sp., 3/6 with
Campylobacter sp. and 9/17 with EAEC infections) and 16/30
were
HIV-positive
(6/7
with
Shigella
sp.,
4/6
with
Campylobacter sp. and 6/17 with EAEC infections).
GII prevalence was weakly associated with symptom presenta-
tion (13.1% in symptomatic vs 6.4% in asymptomatic; p=0.05)
and in those who were HIV-positive (12.6% in HIV-positive vs
6.3% in HIV-negative; p=0.05) (table 1). The prevalence of
Shigella
sp.
was
significantly
higher
in
MSM
who were
HIV-positive (4.7% vs 0.5% in HIV-negative MSM, p=0.01;
table 1).
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first study to estimate GII preva-
lence in MSM with rectal CT attending STI clinics, much of
which is likely to have been sexually transmitted. W
e show that
9% of MSM infected with rectal CTwere coinfected with a GII;
13%, if they were HIV-positive. Although not directly compar-
able, in a cohort of over 700 people attending UK general prac-
tice, who developed GII symptoms, Shigella sp. was not
detected, and the detection rate of EAEC was lower, suggesting
the burden of GII experienced by some MSM may be appre-
ciable.12 W
e have also demonstrated the feasibility of using
rectal swabs for GII testing. Rectal swabs are routinely taken for
STI screening in sexual health clinics and might provide a prac-
ticable and acceptable method for investigating prevalence, clin-
ical presentation and risk factors of GII in MSM to inform the
public health response. Aside from bacterial GII, MSM have his-
torically been at risk of various protozoan and viral GII, includ-
ing Giardia spp., Entamoeba spp. and hepatitis A.13 14 W
e are
exploring whether our approach can be used to identify a
broader range of pathogens. Whether rectal swabs might replace
faecal specimens for clinical diagnosis requires further investiga-
tion to validate test performance and determine whether swabs
would facilitate organism culture for typing and antimicrobial
resistance profiling. Even if feasible and acceptable, further
research on the clinical and public health benefit is needed
before introducing routine testing of asymptomatic MSM for
GII in STI clinics.
Use of a convenience sample to estimate GII prevalence intro-
duces obvious limitations to our study. The men in the study
had been diagnosed with rectal CT and do not represent all
MSM attending STI clinics, they only represent those with a
history of condomless receptive anal intercourse. T
esting MSM
with specific sexual risk behaviours has likely led to higher GII
prevalence. Conversely, repeating DNA extraction from stored
swabs for the GII study is likely to have reduced DNA quantity
and quality and therefore test sensitivity, leading to underestima-
tion of GII prevalence. Furthermore, we had no information on
specific practices associated with GII acquisition, and the small
sample size limited statistical power.
Despite
these
limitations,
the
study
provides
important
insights into GII epidemiology in MSM. Although numbers

 were small, 14 of 30 MSM with GII were asymptomatic, sug-
gesting asymptomatic carriage may play a role in infection trans-
mission.
Our
findings
further
strengthen
the
association
between Shigella sp. transmission and HIV-positive MSM, and
suggest that a similar association may exist for Campylobacter
sp.5 7 The factors underlying this relationship may be associated
with HIV seroadaptive behaviours (choosing to have condom-
less sex with partners according to their perceived HIV status),
as has been observed in other STI epidemics among MSM, and
the effect of HIV infection on biological susceptibility and shed-
ding of Shigella sp.15 16
The clinical and public health response to sexual transmission
of Shigella spp. and other GII has been inadequate, partly
because the role of asymptomatic and persistent infections in
maintaining transmission remains unclear. This study contri-
butes to our understanding of GII in MSM and demonstrates
the potential value of using rectal swabs to detect GII in studies
addressing these questions.
Key messages
▸ About 9% of men who have sex with men with rectal
chlamydia were coinfected with a gastrointestinal infection
(GII); 13%, if they were HIV-positive.
▸ Among those with GII, 14 of 30 were asymptomatic,
suggesting asymptomatic carriage may play a role in sexual
transmission of GII.
▸ Testing rectal swabs may be a feasible and acceptable
method for detecting GIIs.
