background Physical exercise is seen as a promising 
intervention to prevent or delay cognitive decline in 
individuals aged 50 years and older, yet the evidence 
from reviews is not conclusive.
Objectives To determine if physical exercise is effective 
in improving cognitive function in this population.
Design Systematic review with multilevel meta-analysis.
Data sources Electronic databases Medline (PubMed), 
EMBASE (Scopus), PsychINFO and CENTRAL (Cochrane) 
from inception to November 2016.
Eligibility criteria Randomised controlled trials of 
physical exercise interventions in community-dwelling 
adults older than 50 years, with an outcome measure of 
cognitive function.
Results The search returned 12 820 records, of 
which 39 studies were included in the systematic 
review. Analysis of 333 dependent effect sizes from 
36 studies showed that physical exercise improved 
cognitive function (0.29; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.41; p<0.01). 
Interventions of aerobic exercise, resistance training, 
multicomponent training and tai chi, all had significant 
point estimates. When exercise prescription was 
examined, a duration of 45–60 min per session and at 
least moderate intensity, were associated with benefits 
to cognition. The results of the meta-analysis were 
consistent and independent of the cognitive domain 
tested or the cognitive status of the participants.
Conclusions Physical exercise improved cognitive 
function in the over 50s, regardless of the cognitive 
status of participants. To improve cognitive function, 
this meta-analysis provides clinicians with evidence 
to recommend that patients obtain both aerobic and 
resistance exercise of at least moderate intensity on as 
many days of the week as feasible, in line with current 
exercise guidelines.
InTRODuCTIOn
Physical exercise shows promise as a modifiable risk 
factor to reduce the risk of dementia and related 
neurodegenerative diseases.1 As cognitive function 
declines with advancing age, a physically active 
lifestyle has an important role in reducing such 
declines,2 3 as well as the incidence of dementia.4 It 
is hypothesised that the neural and vascular adapta-
tions to physical exercise improve cognitive function 
through promotion of neurogenesis, angiogen-
esis, synaptic plasticity, decreased proinflammatory 
processes and reduced cellular damage due to oxida-
tive stress.5 While lifelong participation in physical 
exercise may be preferable, the adoption of exer-
cise at any age to delay or reverse cognitive decline 
is worthwhile given the prevalence of physical 
inactivity and the increasing proportion of older 
adults in the population.
Although early meta-analyses, such as a study 
of aerobic exercise interventions,6 showed large 
benefits to cognitive function in older adults, more 
recent systematic reviews7 and meta-analytical 
studies8–10 are much less conclusive. For example, a 
recent meta-analysis of aerobic, resistance training 
and tai chi interventions in people older than 50 
showed little benefit of exercise on cognitive func-
tion.9 The discrepancy in findings is partly because 
existing reviews are excessively restrictive in their 
inclusion criteria, often considering only one mode 
of exercise (eg, recent reviews of aerobic training 
only10 11) or a narrow range of publication years. 
Thus, the numerous meta-analyses published provide 
incomplete summaries of the available evidence in 
people aged 50 and over. Studies which prescribe a 
combination of both aerobic and resistance training 
components in one intervention (here on called 
multicomponent training) have not been reviewed in 
healthy older adults since the 2001 study of Colcombe 
and Kramer6 despite global guidelines recommending 
this type of training in older adults.12 13 Alternative 
modes of exercise such as yoga14 or tai chi15 may also 
be beneficial to cognitive function, yet randomised 
controlled trials (RCTs) of these modes in older 
adults have not been specifically reviewed. Impor-
tantly, prior reviews offer relatively little information 
about the optimal prescription of physical exer-
cise for cognitive health. Physical exercise provides 
a complex stimulus for adaptation in the body and 
its dosage can be modulated by various parameters, 
including duration, frequency, intensity and the mode 
or type of exercise. Despite this, many reviews do not 
take into account the importance of exercise prescrip-
tion variables in either the analysis or discussion of 
the literature. Consequently, there is an urgent need 
for guidelines on the type or amount of exercise a 
clinician should recommend to their patient.
To deal with these research gaps, we have 
completed a comprehensive meta-analysis which 
includes a larger number of studies by imposing 
no limit on publication date or exercise mode. 
This study examines four key issues including: (1) 
the effects of supervised exercise interventions of 
aerobic, resistance, multicomponent, tai chi and 
yoga training modes on cognitive function; (2) the 
influence of exercise training variables, including 
the duration, frequency, intensity and length of 
exercise; (3) the differentiation of exercise effects 
on global cognition and domains of cognition, 
including attention, executive function, memory 
working memory; and (4) the impact of study

design, including the nature of the control group and the base-
line cognitive status of participants.
METhODs
This systematic review with meta-analysis was conducted in 
accordance with established guidelines from Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA).16
search strategy
To direct the design of the search strategy, previously completed 
meta-analyses6–9 were reviewed and search terms were piloted 
to ensure a comprehensive identification of potential arti-
cles for inclusion in the systematic review. A computer search 
of Medline (PubMed), EMBASE (Scopus), PsychINFO and 
CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) was 
then conducted up to November 2016, using medical subject 
headings (MeSH) for ‘exercise’ and ‘cognition’ (box 1). ‘Exer-
cise’ and ‘cognition’ search terms were combined with ‘AND’ 
and searched in ‘All Fields’ with the limits human and English 
language (see online supplementary table A). All returned titles 
were screened by the first author (JMN) to exclude duplicate 
or clearly non-relevant studies. The abstract of each remaining 
study was then independently reviewed by JMN and BR. The 
preceding stages were overinclusive. Subsequently, the full 
texts of the remaining studies were independently reviewed by 
JMN, KLP and DJS against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
Disagreements were discussed and consensus reached among the 
authors in all cases. Review authors subsequently searched the 
bibliography of included articles and prior reviews to ensure that 
relevant articles had been captured by the search strategy. All 
studies in the systematic review were eligible for inclusion in the 
meta-analysis.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Studies were included from the initial search if they strictly met 
the following criteria: (1) studies of community dwelling men or 
women aged 50 years or older. Because criteria for diagnosing 
cognitive ability (eg, the presence of mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI)) differ between studies and prior reviews,8 there were no 
limitations on baseline cognitive status. However, studies which 
included clinical samples with other neurological (eg, stroke) or 
mental illnesses (eg, depression) were excluded. (2) A structured 
exercise programme of any mode, duration, frequency or inten-
sity. Exercise programmes that were not explicitly stated as fully 
supervised, or of <4 weeks, were excluded. Studies must have 
allowed the isolated effects of exercise to be measured. (3) A 
control group could include no contact, waiting list, attention 
control, sham exercise or alternative active treatment. (4) At 
least one outcome measure of cognition, measured at baseline 
and follow-up by any validated neuropsychological test of cogni-
tion. (5) The study design was strictly limited to RCTs. (6) A trial 
must have been published in a peer-reviewed journal.
Data extraction
Data on the study population, intervention, control group and 
outcome measures were independently extracted into a stan-
dardised form by two review authors (JMN and DJS). Where 
available, the mean change from baseline, the SD of the mean 
change and the number of participants at each assessment for 
all groups were extracted. Where authors reported more than 
one measured time-point throughout an intervention, only the 
longest follow-up period in which the exercise intervention 
was continued was admitted. Data were extracted such that an 
improvement in performance was coded as a positive change 
score. Variance information was converted to SD. Where the 
mean change from baseline was not available, it was calculated 
from baseline and postintervention cognition scores. Simi-
larly, where change from baseline SD was not available, it was 
calculated from baseline SD and postintervention SD using 
the formula: SDchange=√(SD2
baseline+SD2
postintervention)–(2×Corr× 
SD2
baseline×SD2
postintervention), where Corr=0.5. The value for Corr 
was imputed on the assumption of a moderate correlation 
between baseline and postintervention measures. While this may 
overestimate the change from baseline SD, it represents a conser-
vative approach that is consistent with previous meta-anal-
yses.8 Sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the impact of 
including SDs calculated from the imputed Corr value. Unpub-
lished data (mean and SD) were requested from the authors 
of four studies,17–20 and clarification of published data was 
requested from the author of one study.21 Subsequently, unpub-
lished data from Langlois et al18 and Tsai et al20 were included in 
the quantitative assessment.
Data coding
Descriptive data from each study were coded for inclusion in the 
moderator analysis (described later).
Exercise moderators
In accordance with objective 2 of the review, the characteristics 
of the physical exercise intervention were coded into categorical 
variables. First, the mode of exercise was classified as aerobic, 
resistance training, multicomponent training (an intervention 
with both aerobic and resistance training components), tai chi 
or yoga. Exercise intensity (low; moderate; high) was coded 
in reference to published guidelines that reconcile differences 
in the terminology used to describe exercise intensity.22 23 The 
duration (minutes each session lasted, including any warm-up or 
cool-down) and length (weeks of exercise: short: 4–12 weeks; 
medium: 13–26 weeks; long: >26 weeks) of the training period 
in the exercise and control groups were coded using a prior 
review as a guide.6 The coding for duration (short: ≤45 min; 
medium: >45 to ≤60 min; long: >60 min) was modified from 
Colcombe and Kramer,6 who defined a ‘short’ duration as ≤30 
min. The current review modified this cut-off point as it did 
not include any studies which prescribed exercise for ≤30 
min,

possibly owing to differences in the inclusion criteria. In addi-
tion, the frequency (number of exercise sessions per week: low: 
≤2; medium: 3–4; high: 5–7) of both groups was coded.
Cognitive moderators
To address objective number 3, neuropsychological tests were 
classified according to the domain of cognition being assessed, 
similar to previous reviews.24 The domains considered were 
global cognition (eg, The Mini-Mental State Examination), 
attention (sustained alertness, including the ability to process 
information rapidly), executive function (a set of cognitive 
processes responsible for the initiation and monitoring of 
goal-orientated behaviours), memory (storage and retrieval of 
information) and working memory (short-term manipulation of 
encountered information).24
Study design moderators
Characteristics of the control group and the baseline cognitive 
status of the participants were categorised in accordance with 
objective 4. The control group of each study was organised into 
four categories, including no contact (eg, instructed to maintain 
current lifestyle), active (eg, sham exercise intervention such 
as stretching), educational (eg, health lectures or a computer 
course) or social (eg, social meeting groups). Finally, the baseline 
cognitive status of participants was coded with respect to the 
presence of MCI (yes, no or unclear) using the criteria for MCI 
adopted by Gates et al.8
Risk of bias assessment
T
wo authors (JMN and DJS) independently assessed the risk 
of bias at the study level of included RCTs in accordance with 
the Cochrane Collaboration Guidelines.25 The risk of bias was 
assessed as being ‘low’, ‘high’ or ‘unclear’ across the following 
domains: randomisation; allocation concealment; blinding of 
therapists (intervention supervisors); blinding of participants; 
blinding of outcome assessors; handling of incomplete data (use 
of intention-to-treat analysis); selective reporting and any other 
risk of bias. Discrepancies in the risk of bias assessment were 
resolved by discussion among review authors.
statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was conducted with R version 3.2.126 using 
the metafor package 1.9.7.27
Meta-analysis
The standardised mean difference (SMD) was calculated using 
the mean change from baseline, change SD and number of 
participants for the exercise and control groups. To account for 
dependency between effect sizes, a multilevel random-effects 
model was run using a restricted maximum likelihood esti-
mator.28 Unlike traditional meta-analysis, which requires inde-
pendence of effect sizes, the use of a multilevel meta-analysis 
accounted for dependency by fitting the term study as a random 
factor in the model. The multilevel model was used to estimate 
an overall effect size of exercise interventions versus control 
on cognitive function (objective 1). Heterogeneity was assessed 
using the Q statistic (with p<0.10 suggesting statistically signif-
icant heterogeneity).29 A mixed-effects model was fitted to 
examine the moderators described above as potential sources 
of variance. Initially, separate models were fitted to determine 
the main effects for each exercise (objective 2), cognitive (objec-
tive 3) and study design (objective 4) moderator. The analysis 
of main effects was interpreted using the 95% CI for the point 
estimates of each level of a moderator and the statistical signif-
icance of the omnibus test. Following analysis of main effects, 
where appropriate, and in accordance with the purpose of the 
study, moderators found to be significant were added to one 
model in order to examine possible confounding and to test for 
interaction effects.28
Funnel plots of the effect size against the SE of the effect 
size were visually inspected for small-sample bias and Egger’s 
test values with 95% CI for funnel plot asymmetry were calcu-
lated.30 To run Egger’s test, the multilevel random-effects 
model was modified to include the SE of the effect size as a 
moderator.31 Small-sample bias was considered to be present 
when the funnel plot appeared asymmetrical and the inter-
cept of the Egger’s test was significantly different from zero 
(p<0.10).30 32
The GRADE guidelines33 were applied independently by two 
review authors (JMN and DJS) to evaluate the overall quality of 
evidence for the comparison of exercise versus control groups 
for cognitive function. The overall quality of evidence was 
initially considered ‘high’ owing to the inclusion criteria, which 
stipulated that studies must be a RCT. The quality of evidence 
was downgraded by one level where each of the following four 
factors applied: (1) high risk of study bias; (2) inconsistency 
evaluated by a substantial I2 (>75%). I2 was calculated with the 
following formula: I2(%)=(Q−df)/Q)×100; (3) imprecision due 
to fewer than 400 participants in the outcome and (4) publica-
tion bias identified through an evaluation of funnel plot asym-
metry. Indirectness was not considered owing to the inclusion 
criteria of the review.
REsulTs
The flow of records through the review is summarised in figure 1. 
The initial search strategy returned 12 
820 records, of which 
215 were retrieved for full-text review. Forty-three articles met 
the criteria for inclusion in the qualitative analysis. The analysis 
was conducted on each study. Subsequently, on four occasions 
when a study produced more than one publication (Blumenthal 
et al34 and Madden et al35; Liu-Ambrose et al36 and Liu-Ambrose 
et al37; Nagamatsu et al38 and ten Brinke et al39; and Erickson 
et al40 and Voss et al41), they were considered as one study for 
analysis. Finally, 39 studies were included in the qualitative 
analysis, with all studies eligible for inclusion in the quantita-
tive analysis. The exercise mode was used to group the studies 
into interventions of aerobic exercise (k=18),17 19 34 35 38–52 resis-
tance training (k=13),20 21 36–39 47 53–59 multicomponent training 
(k=10),18 57 60–66 tai chi (k=4)46 67–69 and yoga (k=2).34 70 The 
methodological characteristics of these studies are summarised 
and available in supplementary table B.
Risk of bias
The risk of bias assessment is summarised in figure 2. The majority 
of studies did not describe the process of sequence generation 
or allocation concealment in sufficient detail and were judged 
as having ‘unclear’ risk of bias for these domains. In all of the 
assessed studies it was neither practical nor possible to blind the 
participants and therapists. It was judged that this presented a 
low risk of bias for the therapists but a high risk of bias for the 
participants. Studies were judged to have a high risk of bias for 
incomplete outcome data if they did not employ intention-to-
treat principles in the data analysis or did not account for drop 
outs. All other domains were judged to have a low to unclear 
risk of bias.

Review
Effect of exercise on cognition
The multilevel meta-analysis provides an estimate of the differ-
ence between physical exercise and control on cognitive function 
for 333 dependent effect sizes across 36 studies. The SMD was 
0.29 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.41; p<0.01) and there was significant 
heterogeneity present (Q332=811.00; p<0.01). The funnel plot 
of included studies is presented in figure 3. Visual inspection of 
the funnel plot and a non-significant Egger’s regression intercept 
(p=0.175) suggests the absence of funnel plot asymmetry.
According to the GRADE guidelines, the evidence for this 
outcome was classified as moderate quality. The evidence was 
conservatively downgraded owing to the level of uncertainty 
across each domain of the risk of bias tool (figure 3).
Moderator analysis
To investigate potential sources of variance, moderators were 
analysed one at a time in separate models. The results from this 
stage of analysis are summarised in table 1 and described below.
Exercise moderators
When exercise mode was examined as a moderator, all modes 
of exercise produced significant (p<0.01) and positive effect 
estimates, except for yoga (p=0.27). Studies where the dura-
tion of exercise was medium (>45 min to ≤60 min; p<0.01) 
were associated with significant estimates in comparison with 
short- and long-duration exercise, which were not statistically 
significant. Moderate (p=0.02) and vigorous (p<0.01) intensi-
ties had similar sized effect estimates, whereas low intensity was 
not significant (p=0.11). The frequency and length of the exer-
cise intervention produced significant estimates across all three 
categories. For each exercise moderator analysis, the omnibus 
test was significant and the 95% 
CI for each factor overlapped.
Cognitive moderators
The effect of exercise on cognition was statistically signifi-
cant for all domains, except global cognition. As prior reviews 
have indicated the effects of exercise on cognition may vary

Review
depending on the mode of exercise and cognitive domain, we 
included both these moderators as an interaction term in a sepa-
rate model. Studies of resistance training had significant inter-
action effects on executive function (SMD=0.49, 95% 
CI 0.20 
to 0.78; p<0.01), memory (SMD=0.54, 95% 
CI 0.23 to 0.85; 
p<0.01) and working memory (SMD=0.49, 95% 
CI 0.16 to 
0.82; p<0.01). There was also a significant tai chi x working 
memory interaction (SMD=−0.70, 95% 
CI −1.21 to −0.19; 
p=0.01). All other interaction terms were non-significant.
study design moderators
The type of control group was associated with differences in 
the statistical significance of the effect size estimated. When 
the control group involved either no contact (eg, waiting list, 
usual care; p<0.01) or education (eg, computer course, health 
lectures; p=0.01) the estimate was statistically significant. 
Where the control condition was exposed to an active control 
(eg, stretching; p=0.17) or social group (p=0.62), the effect 
size was still positive but no longer statistically significant. As 
shown in table 1, the cognitive status of the study participants 
did not change the overall result of the meta-analysis. To test the 
differential effect of exercise on cognitive domain dependent on 
cognitive status, both moderators were entered with an interac-
tion effect. There were no significant cognitive status x domain 
interaction effects. In addition, cognitive status and exercise 
mode were entered into a separate model with an interaction 
term. There was only one significant interaction effect for tai chi 
x unclear (SMD=1.11, 95% 
CI 0.16 to 2.07; p=0.02)
DIsCussIOn
This study conducted the most comprehensive systematic review 
of RCTs in adults >50 years of age to date. Importantly, it did 
not limit the inclusion of studies by exercise mode or publication 
date and incorporated a multilevel meta-analysis method that 
included exploration of moderator variables and formal assess-
ment of small-study effects. The key finding from this study is 
that physical exercise interventions are effective in improving 
cognitive function in adults aged >50 years, regardless of cogni-
tive status.
Exercise mode
Of the traditional modes of exercise, studies incorporating 
a component of aerobic or resistance training showed similar 
effect size estimates. Aerobic exercise has previously been asso-
ciated with large improvements in complex cognitive tasks such 
as executive function.6 Although the size of the effect estimates 
reported here is smaller than reported by Colcombe et al,6 our 
study also suggests that aerobic exercise is beneficial to the cogni-
tive functioning of older adults. This finding is of importance 
as the results of more recent reviews8–10 collectively provided 
little evidence of aerobic training benefits and contradicted exer-
cise recommendations for this age group. An important feature 
differentiating this study from more recent reviews of aerobic 
exercise is the multilevel analysis model used and the absence 
of restrictions on publication date. As a result of these differ-
ences, this review was able to conduct a robust investigation, 
with greater statistical power and included a large number of 
otherwise relevant studies not eligible for these recent reviews.

Review
This study confirms previous suggestions that resistance 
training may play an important role in improving cognitive func-
tion in older adults.8 The moderator analysis showed significant 
interaction effects for resistance training with executive function, 
memory and working memory. Although this does not show that 
resistance training is better than other modes of exercise, it does 
suggest that this type of training has particularly pronounced 
effects on these domains of cognitive function. In contrast to 
our results, a previous meta-analysis which tested the effect of 
resistance training found no benefit to cognition in older adults.9 
However, our review contained a greater number of resistance 
training trials than the previous meta-analysis9 by including 
studies published before 200247 56 and those published since their 
census date in 2012.37–39 57–59 Although prior reviews showed that 
the addition of resistance training to an aerobic intervention may 
have additional benefits to cognition compared with aerobic exer-
cise alone,6 24 this is the first review to specifically investigate the 
effect of multicomponent training on cognitive function in this 
age group. As exercise guidelines for this age group recommend 
obtaining both aerobic exercise and resistance training to improve 
health and reduce the risk of disease,12 13 it was important for this 
type of intervention to be reviewed for its effect on cognition. 
Our meta-analysis provides positive evidence for the prescrip-
tion of both aerobic and resistance training (ie, multicomponent 
training), in accordance with exercise recommendations, for this 
age group to specifically improve cognitive functions.
Our meta-analysis also showed that tai chi improved cognitive 
function in this age group, as suggested in previous studies.15 
However, this finding should be considered in the context of the 
small number of tai chi studies included in this review. Further 
evidence is required from large well-designed RCTs to confirm 
this effect. Nevertheless, it is an important finding because 
non-traditional modes of exercise, such as tai chi, may be suit-
able for less functional populations.

Review
Exercise prescription
An important objective of this review was to investigate the role 
of physical exercise training principles on changes in cognitive 
function. The moderator analysis in this study showed that 
exercise of between 45 and 60 min in duration, of moderate or 
vigorous intensity and of any frequency or length is beneficial to 
cognitive function. Although the moderator analysis suggested 
statistical differences in the effect estimates between levels of 
each moderator, the overlapping 95% 
CIs made it difficult to 
discern the practical significance of these differences. While 
there are statistical methods to identify these differences (namely 
pairwise comparisons), there is a risk of inflated type I errors 
and the possibility of false-positive or false-negative results with 
the application of correction factors. As this review provides 
evidence of the beneficial effect of physical exercise on cognitive 
function, future RCTs must instead move beyond investigating 
effectiveness and begin to refine the prescription of training to 
promote the greatest benefits to cognitive function.
Trial design moderators
Several trial design characteristics were investigated as moder-
ating factors. First, the presence of MCI in study participants 
did not change the overall findings of the meta-analysis. This is 
important owing to the increased risk of transitioning to a diag-
nosis of Alzheimer’ s disease or dementia with the presence of 
MCI.72 Although higher levels of physical activity are associated 
with reduced disease progression in MCI,73 it is important to know 
how exercise interventions delay or reverse cognitive decline in a 
population where activity levels may be low. Previous meta-anal-
yses have shown both negligible8 and positive11 effects on cognitive 
function in populations with MCI. Although it is not clear whether 
exercise is more or less effective in cognitively impaired or intact 
patients, the results of our analysis provide additional evidence 
that physical exercise has a positive effect on cognitive function 
in patients with MCI. Second, when the control group used no 
contact (eg, usual care, waiting list) or an education programme 
(eg, health lectures, computer course), the effect estimates were 
all significantly beneficial in comparison with either an active or 
social control. This finding is of interest as it suggests that educa-
tion alone is not sufficient to promote changes in lifestyle habits 
which can be of measurable benefit in the short term.
strengths and limitations
A major strength of this study is that it provides an up-to-date 
summary of supervised RCTs of physical exercise for cognitive 
function in adults aged >50 years and advances previous and 
recent reviews by employing a multilevel design and not limiting 
exercise mode or publication date. Despite this, the findings of the 
review must be considered in the context of a number of limita-
tions. First, the search strategy was limited to English language 
publications and thus there is a possibility of a language bias in the 
systematic review. Second, studies were included only if exercise 
was the sole intervention. Consequently, a large number of studies 
which used exercise as an adjunct component to another interven-
tion (eg, combined cognitive and physical exercise; see Law et al74) 
were excluded. As the objectives of this review were to examine 
the effect of physical exercise, it was not appropriate to include 
such studies. Additionally, the RCTs included here were strictly 
limited to fully supervised exercise interventions. This inclusion 
criterion was implemented as it is important to acknowledge the 
methodological and conceptual differences between a supervised 
and unsupervised intervention. From a public health perspective, 
however, the effect of unsupervised exercise or a comparison 
between supervised and unsupervised exercise interventions would 
be of great value. Future meta-analyses designed to specifically 
answer this question are required.
COnClusIOns
This meta-analysis showed that physical exercise interven-
tions are effective at improving the cognitive function of older 
adults, regardless of baseline cognitive status. Interventions of 
aerobic, resistance training, multicomponent training and tai chi 
were similarly effective. The findings suggest that an exercise 
programme with components of both aerobic and resistance-type 
training, of at least moderate intensity and at least 45 min per 
session, on as many days of the week as possible, is beneficial to 
cognitive function in adults aged >50 years.
What are the new findings?
 
► Physical exercise interventions significantly improved 
cognitive function in adults older than 50 years, regardless of 
baseline cognitive status.
 
► Positive benefits to cognition occurred with an exercise 
intervention that included tai chi, or resistance and aerobic 
training, prescribed either in isolation or combined.
 
► When exercise training variables were considered, 
interventions that included exercise with a minimum duration 
of 45 min and at moderate to vigorous intensity showed 
improvements to cognitive function.
how might it impact on clinical practice in the near 
future?
 
► This meta-analysis provides positive evidence that a 
combination of aerobic and resistance type exercise of at 
least moderate intensity on as many days of the week as 
feasible is beneficial to cognitive function.
 
► Tai chi may be a promising intervention aimed at brain health 
for the over 50s, although further high quality randomised 
controlled trials are required to confirm the benefits shown in 
this study.
 
► The dosage of physical exercise is important and clinicians 
should ensure their exercise recommendations are 
individualised and provide a sufficient training stimulus.
