Objective To review and compare treatments (1) 
after primary traumatic shoulder dislocation aimed at 
minimising the risk of chronic shoulder instability and (2) 
for chronic post-traumatic shoulder instability.
Design Intervention systematic review with random 
effects network meta-analysis and direct comparison 
meta-analyses.
Data sources Electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, 
Cochrane Clinical Trials Register, Cochrane Database 
of Systematic Reviews, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, Ovid 
MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other 
Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, DARE, 
HTA, NHSEED, Web of Science) and reference lists were 
searched from inception to 15 January 2018.
Eligibility criteria for selecting 
studies Randomised trials comparing any interventions 
either after a first-time, traumatic shoulder dislocation 
or chronic post-traumatic shoulder instability, with a 
shoulder instability, function or quality of life outcome.
Results Twenty-two randomised controlled trials 
were included. There was moderate quality evidence 
suggesting that labrum repair reduced the risk of future 
shoulder dislocation (relative risk 0.15; 95% CI 0.03 to 
0.8, p=0.026), and that with non-surgical management 
47% of patients did not experience shoulder 
redislocation. Very low to low-quality evidence suggested 
no benefit of immobilisation in external rotation versus 
internal rotation. There was low-quality evidence that an 
open procedure was superior to arthroscopic surgery for 
preventing shoulder redislocations.
Conclusions There was moderate-quality evidence 
that half of the patients managed with physiotherapy 
after a first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation did not 
experience recurrent shoulder dislocations. If chronic 
instability develops, surgery could be considered. There 
was no evidence regarding the effectiveness of surgical 
management for post-traumatic chronic shoulder 
instability.
InTRODuCTIOn
The shoulder is the most commonly dislocated large 
joint.1 A traumatic shoulder dislocation is often 
accompanied by a labral lesion,2–7 which predis-
poses the patient to developing chronic shoulder 
instability.8–11 The incidence of primary shoulder 
dislocation varies between 15.31 and 56.312 per 
100 000 person-years. Most patients are men aged 
under 40 years and most dislocations are sports 
injuries. Both these facts make shoulder disloca-
tion and possible subsequent chronic instability an 
important health issue for young, active patients 
and their treating clinicians.13
Acute treatment of a dislocated shoulder is closed 
reduction, which should be performed as soon as 
possible, either on the field or in an emergency 
department.14 Some patients develop recurrent 
dislocations or symptomatic subluxations even in 
daily activities. This has prompted suggestions that 
surgical stabilisation may be indicated after the first 
dislocation—a treatment strategy that has been 
investigated in several randomised controlled trials 
(RCT), with mixed results.3 4 6 7 15 16
There is considerable variation in the manage-
ment of patients after a primary traumatic shoulder 
dislocation (both between surgeons and disci-
plines).17 18 Most patients with chronic post-trau-
matic shoulder instability are offered stabilisation 
surgery, while the surgical methods vary widely.17–20 
Some evidence suggests that in the management of 
musculoskeletal conditions patients are more likely 
to undergo surgical treatment if the treating physi-
cian is a surgeon versus a non-surgical specialty (eg, 
physiotherapy),21 and that surgeons more easily 
recommend surgical treatment if the evidence 
regarding the effectiveness of surgery is inconclu-
sive.19 Thus, to provide the best care, physiothera-
pists, physical medicine specialists, sports medicine 
specialists and orthopaedic surgeons should know 
what is the best quality evidence for treatment of 
shoulder instability.
Therefore, we aimed to assess the current 
evidence regarding the effectiveness of interven-
tions after  primary traumatic shoulder dislocation 
and in chronic post-traumatic shoulder instability. 
Our systematic review focused on two clinical 
effectiveness questions regarding post-traumatic 
shoulder instability: (1) What are the best treat-
ments to reduce the incidence of chronic shoulder 
instability after a first-time traumatic shoulder 
dislocation? and (2) How can the clinician best 
treat a patient with chronic post-traumatic shoulder 
instability?
METhODs
We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement22 
when conducting and reporting this prospectively 
registered systematic review (PROSPERO registra-
tion ID: CRD42015020303). We use dislocation to 
refer to a true dislocation of the joint and insta-
bility to refer to dislocations, subluxations or other 
symptoms of instability either alone or together. 
By recurrent dislocation(s) and redislocation(s) we 
mean one or more dislocations after the primary 
episode, and by chronic post-traumatic instability 
we mean recurrent dislocation(s), subluxations or 
other symptoms of instability occurring after a first-
time traumatic shoulder dislocation.

Review
Data sources and searches
We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of 
Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 
Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, Ovid MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, 
In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE 
Daily, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effect (DARE), Health 
Technology Assessment Database, NHS Economic Evaluation 
Database and Web of Science on 15 January 2018. There were 
no restrictions on language or publication date. We adjusted the 
search strategies to meet the specifications of the individual data-
bases (online supplementary appendix 1). We reviewed the refer-
ence lists of included publications and earlier reviews to identify 
any additional studies that were missed in the electronic data-
base search. We also searched the WHO International Clinical 
Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) ( 
www. 
who. 
int/ 
ictrp) on 
23 January 2018 for registrations of the included RCTs, possible 
completed but unpublished RCTs and ongoing RCTs.
study selection
We included RCTs that compared any interventions after a 
first-time, traumatic shoulder dislocation or chronic post-trau-
matic shoulder instability with a follow-up of at least 1 
year. We 
required an outcome measure related to shoulder instability, 
shoulder function or quality of life. We excluded studies of treat-
ment of non-traumatic shoulder instability, cadaveric or biome-
chanical studies and studies on secondary shoulder instability 
(such as neurological conditions, syndromes or congenital condi-
tions). T
wo investigators (LK and TL) independently assessed all 
identified publications for eligibility and resolved any disagree-
ments by consensus.
Data extraction and risk of bias assessment
We categorised the included publications according to the two 
clinical scenarios under review (first-time traumatic shoulder 
dislocation and chronic post-traumatic shoulder instability). We 
extracted the outcome data for all available follow-up assess-
ments. For primary shoulder dislocation, we used redislocation 
data from 1-year and 2-year follow-ups as defined in the indi-
vidual studies. If numeric outcome data were unavailable, we 
extracted the data from figures and graphs.
In addition to the outcome measures, we extracted the 
following information regarding the trial characteristics and 
participants: study objectives, inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
number of patients allocated to intervention and control groups, 
follow-up time, sex distribution, mean age, proportion of sports 
injuries, indications for surgery, treatments for the interven-
tion and control groups, associated soft-tissue and bony inju-
ries, prespecified and reported harms, sample size estimations, 
study sponsorships and conflict of interest statements and trial 
registry identifiers. We extracted the method of randomisation 
and randomisation sequence generation, allocation conceal-
ment, degrees of blinding, loss to follow-up, intention-to-treat 
analysis, selective reporting, similarity of patient groups, cointer-
ventions, compliance and timing of the outcome assessment. All 
data were extracted to a customised worksheet independently 
by two reviewers (LK and TL). We sent emails to authors of 
potentially eligible conference abstracts, publications with no 
available source data and unpublished trials and inquired about 
the status of the trial and requested data to be included in the 
meta-analyses.
T
wo reviewers (LK and TL) independently assessed the study-
level risk of bias according to the guidelines of the Cochrane Back 
Review Group.23 The risk of bias assessment has 12 independent 
criteria; with a judgement of ‘yes’, ‘unclear’ or ‘no’. If at least six 
of the 12 criteria were judged to be at low risk of bias (‘yes’), the 
risk of bias in the publication was considered low.23
To assess possible selective reporting of results, we compared 
the outcome measures specified in the methods section of the 
publication and in the trial registry (if available) to what was 
reported in the results section of the publication. For the analysis 
of the timing of the outcome assessment, we deemed a deviation 
of 3 
months (in a 2-year follow-up) to be an acceptable range. 
Disagreements between the two reviewers on the retrieved 
data were resolved by consensus. If any item was unclear, we 
contacted the authors by email to clarify the issue.
Researcher conflict of interest and industry sponsorship have 
been identified as potential sources of bias.24–26 We evaluated 
and noted the existence of these potential sources of bias in the 
studies.
Data synthesis and analysis
We performed meta-analyses of clinically homogenous studies 
(patient populations, indications of treatment, intervention pairs 
and outcomes). If studies with same intervention-control pairs 
were not sufficiently homogenous, we performed multiple pair-
wise meta-analyses of the trials with poolable patients and data. 
In the analysis of surgical treatment after first-time shoulder 
dislocation, we performed a frequentist network meta-analysis 
to assess the effectiveness of surgical treatment alternatives at 
matching time points available in the source data. We prioritised 
outcomes at 2 
years since the majority of shoulder redislocations 
take place within that time.27–33 If a trial had reported outcomes 
at multiple time points, we used data from one time point only 
in a single analysis. We calculated the number needed to treat 
(NNT) and number needed to harm (NNH)34 for interventions 
with dichotomous outcomes and statistically significant between-
group comparisons. For shoulder redislocations, the NNT is the 
number of patients who need to receive a treatment to prevent 
one patient having a shoulder redislocation. The NNH is the 
number of patients who need to be treated in a certain way to 
cause a redislocation. For NNT estimates we used the point esti-
mate of the relevant risk ratio, base redislocation risk from a 
systematic review (21%–47%, minimum follow-up of 2 
years)35 
and the redislocation rates in the relevant included trials.
We based all analyses on random effects models due to 
expected variation among patients and outcome measurements. 
Statistical heterogeneity was quantified with the I2 statistic. Sensi-
tivity analyses or metaregression was not performed to explore 
heterogeneity or the effect of bias. In the network meta-analysis 
(NMA), the assumption of exchangeability was evaluated quali-
tatively. Inconsistency was evaluated using tau2 and Cochran Q 
statistic and corresponding p values, and the Netheat plot.36 Use 
of quantitative methods to assess exchangeability or the use of 
p score to estimate the best treatment was not possible due to the 
low number of trials in the network. We did not plan subgroup 
analyses.
We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, 
Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to rate the 
quality of evidence and present a summary of findings table.37 
We downgraded for inconsistency if the magnitude or direc-
tion of effects were dissimilar, the CIs had minimal overlap, the 
test of heterogeneity was significant or if the I2 was >50%. For 
imprecision, we downgraded if the CIs were very wide or if the 
Optimal Information Size criteria were not met. We used Review 
Manager (RevMan) (V
.5.3.5)38 for the meta-analyses, the netmeta 
package36 in R (V
.3.2.1)39 for the network meta-analysis and

The study did not involve patients.
REsulTs
The literature search yielded 2867 reports after exclusion of 
duplicates. Of these reports, 55 were considered for inclusion 
after review of titles and abstracts (figure 1). After full-text 
review, 25 publications (22 RCTs) were included (figure 1). 
Studies excluded at the full-text screening stage are presented 
in online supplementary appendix table 1. We identified six 
unpublished RCTs (online supplementary appendix table 2). 
Five of these explored external rotation (ER) versus internal 
rotation (IR) as a treatment for a first-time traumatic shoulder 
dislocation. We did not receive data of any trial. We identified 20 
ongoing RCTs (online supplementary appendix table 3).
Of the 22 included RCTs, 10 investigated treatment after a 
first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation. Four studied whether 
early surgery was beneficial after a first-time traumatic shoulder 
dislocation,3 4 6 7 15 16 and five compared the effect of upper 
limb immobilisation in ER versus IR in preventing further 
instability.41–45 T
welve RCTs focused on chronic post-traumatic 
shoulder instability, of which four RCTs compared open labral 
repair with arthroscopic labral repair2 5 46 47 and three compared 
absorbable with non-absorbable suture anchors.48–50
Mean participant age ranged from 20.3 to 36 years. The mean 
follow-up ranged from 12 to 143 months. In 15 RCTs, 67% of 
the primary dislocations were sports injuries; seven RCTs did 
not report injury mechanism.2 5 45 46 50–52 One study included 
patients with large bony defects of the glenoid.52 The trials are 
summarised in table 1; online supplementary appendix tables 4 
and 5 present all extracted data.
Risk of bias assessment

wenty-one 
were classical RCTs; one used a minimisation algorithm.6 T

to 198 participants. Sample size estimation was described by 14

Arm position
Immobilisation in ER (vs IR) had no effect on the redisloca-

trials, three separate direct comparison meta-analyses comparing 
immobilisation in ER versus IR were performed: one of trials 
with young patients and narrow age range reporting redislo-
cations, second of a subset of the former reporting instability 
and a third of older patients with a wide age range reporting 
instability. In none did the arm position affect the outcome.

Restriction band usage
There was one trial investigating the use of a shoulder motion 
restriction band after immobilisation in ER (vs immobilisation in 
ER only). The restriction band had no effect on shoulder redis-
location rates.57
Chronic post-traumatic shoulder instability
Open versus arthroscopic surgery
There was a statistically significant difference in favour of open 
labrum repair for preventing redislocations (three studies, 269 
patients) (RR 0.43; 95% 
CI 0.19 to 0.97; p=0.04; I2=0%; 
p=0.43) and instability (two studies, 223 patients) (RR 0.49; 
95% 
CI 0.26 to 0.92; p=0.03; I2=0%; p=0.99) (online supple-
mentary appendix figure 3a,b; table 4). The NNH was approx-
imately 12, defined here as a redislocation that would not have 
occurred if open instead of arthroscopic technique had been 
used.
Absorbable versus non-absorbable suture anchors, tacks or suture 
materials
There were no differences in recurrent instability rates between 
absorbable and non-absorbable suture anchors (three studies, 
232 patients)48–50 (RR 0.62; 95% 
CI 0.21 to 1.86; p=0.40; 
I2=0%; p=0.95) (online supplementary appendix figure 4; 
table 5). The absorbability of tacks or suture material had no 
effect on recurrent instability rate.48–50 53–55
Accelerated versus traditional postsurgical rehabilitation and 
different surgical procedures
There was one trial investigating each of these topics. Neither 
the pace of rehabilitation after surgical intervention nor the 
surgical method had any effect on the redislocations or chronic 
instability.51 52 56

DIsCussIOn
Our review aimed to answer two patient-oriented questions 
relevant to clinical practice: (1) What are the best treatments to 
reduce the incidence of chronic shoulder instability after a first-
time traumatic shoulder dislocation? and (2) How should the 
clinician best treat a patient with chronic post-traumatic shoulder 
instability? Evidence regarding the comparative effectiveness of 
surgery versus non-surgical treatment is currently available only 
for a first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation: early surgery led 
to fewer shoulder redislocations. However, approximately half 
of the patients primarily treated non-surgically do not experi-
ence a shoulder redislocation or develop shoulder instability 
within 2 
years of the primary injury. Immobilisation in ER was 
not beneficial after a first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation 
compared with immobilisation in IR.
For the treatment of chronic post-traumatic shoulder insta-
bility, we did not identify any RCTs that assessed the effective-
ness or efficacy of surgery versus non-surgical measures or sham 
surgery. Open Bankart repair produced more reliable results 
than the arthroscopic method for prevention of shoulder redis-
locations. There were no differences between other technical 
aspects of surgery.
Treatment after a first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation
Labrum repair was more effective than non-surgical treat-
ment for first-time dislocation in terms of fewer redislocations. 
Arthroscopic lavage was no more effective at 2 
years compared 
with non-surgical treatment, making arthroscopic lavage a 
candidate placebo surgical treatment in this context. Our NMA 
indicated a beneficial effect of labrum repair on the incidence 
of shoulder redislocation when compared with non-surgical 
treatment. The NNT—in this context the number of patients 
who needed to undergo surgery to prevent one patient having 
a shoulder redislocation—was 2.5–5.6 based on external data35 
and 2.0–4.7 based on the data in the included trials.3 4 6
Regarding disease-specific quality of life, no meaningful 
meta-analysis was possible. There were some differences 
between the treatment alternatives in favour of labrum repair 
(online supplementary appendix table 5).4 6 Even though the 
differences were small, they were consistent with and explained 
by the reduced risk of shoulder redislocations and chronic insta-
bility in the groups treated with labrum repair.
The study populations in the included RCTs consisted mostly of 
young men and the majority of dislocations were sports related, 
making the results applicable to the typical patient, but the 
generalisability to women, non-athletes and older patients is 
uncertain. Our results are less favourable towards surgery than 
those presented by previous systematic reviews and meta-anal-
yses.58 59 This difference might be attributed to a strict inclu-
sion of RCTs only, the handling of labrum repair, arthroscopic 
lavage and non-surgical treatment as separate entities and the 
use of NMA. Overall, since only about half of the patients in the 
included studies and in a large long-term prospective cohort60 
suffered shoulder redislocations and the NNTs are relatively 
high, the prevailing practice17 of low-threshold surgery after 
a first-time shoulder dislocation can be questioned. Previous 
studies have suggested that delaying surgery and waiting to see 
whether the patient developed chronic instability after a first-
time traumatic shoulder dislocation did not lead to a less favour-
able prognosis of instability, quality of life or glenohumeral joint 
osteoarthritis.61 62 Compared with routine surgery after a first-
time traumatic shoulder dislocation, waiting to see if a patient 
develops chronic instability despite rehabilitation might direct 
resources more efficiently and may save half of patients from 
unnecessary surgery.
Arm position after primary traumatic shoulder dislocation 
(immobilisation in ER vs IR) had no effect on the risk of redislo-
cations or chronic shoulder instability. This finding is consistent 
with other meta-analyses.63–66 The number of unpublished trials 
investigating immobilisation in ER identified was equal to the 
number of RCTs included in this review, which raises concerns 
of publication bias. Immobilisation in an ordinary arm sling for 
comfort appears to be preferable to the use of an ER brace.
Chronic post-traumatic shoulder instability
There were no RCTs exploring the effectiveness of surgery 
versus non-surgical treatment, which is an important evidence 
gap. Open labrum repair appears to be more effective than 
arthroscopic labrum repair in successfully stabilising an unstable 
shoulder, while there was no difference in other outcomes or 
harms. The point estimate for the RR was 0.43; this means that 
arthroscopic technique was more than twice as likely to fail as 
open technique, and the NNH was approximately 12, defined 
here as a shoulder redislocation that would not have occurred if 
open technique had been used instead of arthroscopy. Previous 
meta-analyses, which have also included non-randomised studies, 
have suggested no difference between open and arthroscopic 
techniques67–73 or a difference in favour of the open method.74–76 
Although we have witnessed a rapid increase in the popularity 
of arthroscopy within the past two decades to the point of it 
being considered the accepted standard,77–81 our findings might 
justify a tempering of enthusiasm for the arthroscopic method. 
On the other hand, even though the perceived effectiveness 
of surgery might be overestimated since the natural course of 
chronic post-traumatic shoulder instability is largely unknown, 
the results of surgery for chronic instability are encouraging in 
terms of the low redislocation rates after surgery in the included 
trials.
study bias
The risk of bias among the included RCTs was relatively low. 
However, concern for confounding still exists, as there was 
considerable heterogeneity in the follow-up time and less than 
half (41%) of the studies used any kind of blinding. In most 
trials, the primary outcome was recurrent dislocation, a relatively 
‘hard’ endpoint. However, in the included RCTs, the definition 
of redislocation varied from a solely symptoms-based diagnosis 
to one that was confirmed radiographically or alternatively, an 
event that required a manual reduction. Analysis on the effect of 
conflicts of interest or industry sponsorship on trial results was 
not possible due to heterogeneity.
limitations
The use of shoulder instability-validated outcome instruments 
was rare4 6 15 42 44 45 47 52 and baseline values were seldom 
reported.45 47 The publications also generally did not meet the 
assumptions of the power calculations, making a type II error 
possible. Another limitation is publication bias in the field, as 
studies with ‘negative results’ for the intervention are more 
likely to remain unpublished,82 risking overestimation of the 
true effect in meta-analyses. A methodological limitation is 
that no sensitivity analyses or meta-regression were performed. 
Finally, our findings apply only to patients with almost intact

Review
What is already known on this subject?
 
► After a first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation, 
approximately half of patients developed recurrent shoulder 
dislocation within 2 years.
 
► Some studies have shown promising results with surgery 
after a first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation. Primary 
surgery has been advocated to prevent chronic shoulder 
instability.
 
► Many patients with chronic post-traumatic shoulder 
instability are offered stabilising surgery. Current practice 
favours arthroscopic labral repair over open surgery.
What this study adds?
 
► There was moderate-quality evidence that patients who 
had labrum repair surgery after a first-time traumatic 
shoulder dislocation had lower recurrent dislocation rates 
than patients treated with physiotherapy. However, surgical 
treatment has a relatively high number needed to treat (2.5–
5.6) to prevent redislocation.
 
► In the treatment of chronic post-traumatic shoulder 
instability, effectiveness of surgery compared with non-
surgical treatment is not known. Low-quality evidence 
supported open labrum repair over arthroscopic labrum 
repair.
bony glenoids, as in all but one trial no marked bony defects of 
the glenoid were present among the patients.52 This has direct 
clinical relevance as shoulder dislocation occasionally causes a 
sizeable glenoid fracture, or the glenoid bone may erode with 
numerous redislocations.83
A limitation to the clinical relevance of our findings is that 
the effect of a shoulder redislocation on patient quality of life 
remains unclear. An occasional shoulder dislocation may result 
in mild discomfort while the shoulder functions otherwise 
normally. In contrast, a subjectively unstable shoulder may be 
associated with constant fear of dislocations, kinesiophobia 
and poor function even in the absence of redislocations.4 84 
If the primary treatment aim was to prevent redislocations 
only, shoulder arthrodesis would be very effective. However, 
such a treatment would also likely be associated with poor 
functional outcomes, and we might reasonably expect this 
treatment and outcome is not desired by patients.85
FuTuRE REsEARCh
The most important evidence gaps regarding clinical practice are 
the effectiveness of surgery for chronic post-traumatic shoulder 
instability and what is the ideal physiotherapy regime for 
non-surgical management after a primary traumatic dislocation 
or for chronic post-traumatic instability. The impact of surgery 
to patient quality of life should also be investigated. Future trials 
should be adequately designed,86 87 powered and reported,88 and 
use validated measures of disability or function in addition to 
the shoulder redislocation rate. Due to the placebo effects asso-
ciated with surgery, further trials should be double blinded and 
placebo controlled whenever possible.6 89 90
COnClusIOns
There was an RR of 0.15 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.8) for a recur-
rent dislocation after first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation 
in favour of labrum repair compared with physiotherapy. The 
certainty in the evidence was moderate. Forty-seven per cent of 
patients with a first-time traumatic shoulder dislocation treated 
non-surgically did not experience a redislocation within 2 
years.
