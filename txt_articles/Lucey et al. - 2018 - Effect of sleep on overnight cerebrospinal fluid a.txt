Sleep disturbances are associated with future risk of Alz-
heimer disease. Disrupted sleep increases soluble amy-
loid b, suggesting a mechanism for sleep disturbances
to increase Alzheimer disease risk. We tested this
response in humans using indwelling lumbar catheters
to serially sample cerebrospinal fluid while participants
were sleep-deprived, treated with sodium oxybate, or
allowed to sleep normally. All participants were infused
with 13C6-leucine to measure amyloid b kinetics. We
found that sleep deprivation increased overnight amy-
loid b38, amyloid b40, and amyloid b42 levels by 25 to
30% via increased overnight amyloid b production rela-
tive to sleeping controls. These findings suggest that
disrupted sleep increases Alzheimer disease risk via
increased amyloid b production.

A
lzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegener-
ative disorder characterized by cognitive impairment
and neuropathologic extracellular plaques of amyloid b
(Ab) and intracellular inclusions of tau. Sleep disturban-
ces are associated with future risk of AD.1–3 For example,
women with sleep efficiency <70% are 1.61 times more
likely to develop cognitive impairment than women with
sleep efficiency 70% or greater.1
Recent evidence suggests increased risk of AD from
sleep disturbances may be due, at least in part, to an Ab
mechanism. Diurnal oscillation of interstitial fluid (ISF)
and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Ab concentrations in both
mice and humans has been replicated in multiple studies
using different assays.4–7 Ab aggregation as insoluble pla-
que is concentration-dependent and is hypothesized to be
a key early step in AD pathogenesis. Sleep disruption in
mice4 and humans8,9 increases soluble Ab concentrations
and, potentially, plaque deposition. Although these find-
ings suggest sleep as a potential novel modulator of AD
pathology, we do not know whether sleep alters Ab pro-
duction and/or clearance, leaving a critical gap in our
ability to pursue sleep modulation as a preventive strat-
egy for AD. In this pilot study, we collected serial CSF
from sleep-deprived, sleep-induced, and control partici-
pants who were infused with 13C6-leucine to measure Ab
stable isotope labeling kinetics (SILK).
Subjects and Methods
Participants and Sleep Interventions
Eight participants aged 30 to 60 years were recruited from both
longitudinal studies at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research
Center and a research volunteer registry at Washington University
(Volunteers for Health). Three participants were male. All partici-
pants were cognitively normal (Clinical Dementia Rating score of
0 or Mini-Mental Status Examination � 27).10,11 Participant
characteristics are shown in Table 1. The study was conducted at
the Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis, Mis-
souri. The study protocol was approved by the Washington Uni-
versity Institutional Review Board and the General Clinical
Research Center Advisory Committee. The Clinical Trials num-
ber was NCT02063217. All participants completed written
informed consent and were compensated for their participation
in the study.
Participants were initially randomized to 1 of 3 groups: (1)
behavioral sleep deprivation for 36 hours, (2) sleep induced with
sodium oxybate, and (3) normal sleep (control). Sodium oxybate
was selected for sleep induction because it enhances slow wave
sleep (SWS).12 Each participant was invited to repeat the study
and undergo randomization to a different group. Four partici-
pants repeated the study once, and 4 participants completed all 3
groups. All participants were in good general health, had no

 clinical sleep or neurological diseases, and had no contraindica-
tion to a lumbar catheter. All participants were screened to
exclude sleep-disordered breathing with a home sleep apnea test
(Apnealink; ResMed, San Diego, CA).
Polysomnography was performed as previously reported5
throughout
each
participant’s
admission
to
the
Clinical
Research Unit. After an acclimation night, an intrathecal lum-
bar catheter was placed and collection of samples were started
in all participants at 07:00. All participants were kept awake
from the time of lumbar catheter placement (07:00) until the
start of the intervention (21:00). At 21:00, control partici-
pants were permitted to sleep and participants in the sleep-
induced group received their first dose of sodium oxybate. A
second dose of sodium oxybate was administered at 01:00.
Sodium oxybate doses ranged from 3.25 to 3.75g at both
21:00 and 01:00 (total dose 5 6.5–7.5g/night) and were
adjusted for each participant for a range of 45 to 55mg/kg.
Participants in the sleep-deprived group were kept awake by
nursing staff and did not receive stimulants. The lumbar cath-
eter was removed on day 2 at 19:00, and participants lay flat
for 12 hours. Participants had meals served at 09:00, 13:00,
and 18:00. Headaches were the most common adverse event,
and 2 participants required blood patches for spinal headaches
(see Table 1).
Sample Collection and Ab SILK Analysis
Six milliliters of CSF was obtained every 2 hours for 36 hours.
All
samples
were
processed
and
measured
as
previously
described.13 The procedure for stable isotope amino acid tracer
administration, sample collection, and Ab SILK tracer protocol
using a 9-hour infusion of [U-13C6]leucine was performed as
previously reported.13 Ab SILK modeling was based on previ-
ously published models13–15 with modifications necessitated by
the reduced post-tracer sampling time compared to previous
studies (22 vs 36 hours). The model consisted of a plasma leu-
cine precursor pool that generated labeled Ab38, Ab40, and
Ab42 peptides. Each arm of the model consisted of a time
delay process and a single compartment process; the length of
the time delay and the single compartment fractional turnover
rate (FTR) was independently adjustable for each peptide. The
FTR represents the sum of irreversible losses of brain peptides
to all processes (eg, recovery in CSF, clearance through the
blood–brain barrier, and in situ proteolysis, uptake, or deposi-
tion). The production rate of each peptide was determined as
the flux rate through the terminal CSF sampling site of the
model. Compartmental modeling was performed using SAAM
II (v2.3.1; Epsilon Group, Charlottesville, VA). None of our
participants had evidence of brain Ab deposition based on
Ab42:Ab40 > 0.12; therefore, exchange of Ab42 with an "insol-
uble" compartment was not included.13
Statistics
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 23
(IBM, Armonk, NY). All serial CSF Ab data were analyzed
with general linear mixed models to account for the depen-
dencies among the longitudinal measurements.16 Intervention
group and time of day were treated as fixed effects. Random
intercepts and slopes for time were used to accommodate indi-
vidual variation. The Akaike Information Criterion was used to
compare covariance structures, and compound symmetry was
selected as the best fit. Statistical significance was set at
p < 0.05. Bonferroni correction was used when making compar-
ison between the 3 intervention groups (0.05/3). The normality
assumption was verified through residual plots. Differences in
participant characteristics were also assessed with mixed models,
as with the Ab models, but without a time factor.
Results
Ab concentrations were normalized to a baseline for each
subject (average of hours 07:00–19:00) before each
group’s intervention. Mean overnight CSF Ab38, Ab40,
and Ab42 concentrations increased 30% above baseline
levels in sleep-deprived participants compared to the con-
trol and drug groups (Fig 1A–C, Table 2). There were
no statistically significant differences between the control
and drug groups. Figure 2 shows the change from base-
line of Ab40 for each participant. Ab38 and Ab42
showed similar within-subject changes from baseline
(data not shown). The time courses curves for 13C6-leu-
cine isotopic enrichment overlapped for Ab38, Ab40,
and Ab42 (see Fig 1); the FTR of Ab peptides is
extremely sensitive to the shape of these curves.14 Ratios
of labeled Ab38/40 and Ab42/40 were flat across the
sampling period for all groups, showing that the peptides
had equivalent FTRs. Formal modeling analysis revealed
that the FTRs and delay times were not significantly dif-
ferent between groups (see Table 2), which strongly sug-
gests a lack of sleep pattern on the overall clearance pro-
cesses of brain peptides. Because production rate is
directly proportional to concentration in the model,14
overnight Ab production rate in the sleep-deprived group
was increased 30%.
Discussion
Diurnal oscillation of Ab is hypothesized to result from
(1) changes in Ab production by neuronal activity17,18
and (2) changes in Ab clearance via ISF bulk flow to cer-
vical lymphatics and CSF during sleep (ie, “glymphatic ”
drainage).19
During
wakefulness,
Ab
concentration
increases due to increased neuronal activity (production)
and decreased ISF flow (clearance). Conversely, neuronal
activity decreases and ISF flow increases during sleep,
together accounting for a decrease in Ab concentration.
As predicted and consistent with prior work,8,9 disrupted
sleep resulted in higher overnight CSF Ab levels in our
study. The effect of disrupted sleep on overnight CSF Ab
levels in individual participants was variable, however
(see Fig 2). We hypothesize that this variability was due
Lucey et al: Disrupted Sleep and Amyloid b

 to factors not identifiable in our pilot study (age, gender,
race, Apoe genotype).
The absence of group differences from the Ab
SILK puts constraints on the possible mechanisms that
could account for the altered concentration time courses.
We have previously shown that the shape of the kinetic
curve is most sensitive to changes in clearance rates and
is entirely unaffected by changes in production rate.14
We performed sensitivity analyses using example data
from 1 participant and held all model parameters con-
stant except for either production rate or FTR. When
the production rate was 1% or 199% of nominal, the
SILK curves were identical (Fig 3A). However, changes
in FTR as small as 5% resulted in a noticeable change in
peak shape and a small shift in peak time; 20% changes
in FTR led to large changes in peak shape and peak time
with separation of the labeling curves (see Fig 3B, C).
Increased amyloid precursor protein (APP) produc-
tion or increased cleavage of APP by b-secretase would
increase the concentrations of all Ab isoforms without
altering the shapes of the SILK curves. In PSEN1 muta-
tion carriers without amyloid deposition, for example,
FIGURE 1: Overnight cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid b (Ab) kinetics. Eight subjects participated in the study. Four partici-
pants completed the control, the sleep-deprived, and sleep-induced intervention groups. Four participants completed 2
groups. (A–C) All Ab38, Ab40, and Ab42 concentrations were normalized to the baseline 07:00 to 19:00. The overnight period
during the intervention night was defined as hours 18 to 28 (01:00–11:00) to account for transit time of CSF from the brain to
lumbar catheter (shaded area). Sleep deprivation increased overnight Ab by 30% over the baseline compared to participants in
the control and sleep-induced groups; however, the control and sleep-induced groups were not significantly different. (D–F) Ab
peptide enrichments were normalized to each subject’s plasma leucine enrichment plateau. The shapes of the normalized sta-
ble isotope labeling kinetics curves were similar between groups for Ab38, Ab40, and Ab42. (G, H) Ab38/40 and Ab42/40 iso-

 increased Ab production does not alter the shape of
13C6-leucine labeling curves.14,15 Furthermore, soluble
CSF APP metabolites fluctuate with a diurnal pattern,20
providing additional support that APP production is
altered by sleep–wake activity. Sleep also did not alter
labeled Ab38/Ab40 and Ab42/Ab40 ratios, suggesting
sleep does not affect Ç-secretase activity.
A change in overall clearance will affect the FTR of
brain Ab peptides, which is the sum of losses to CSF
and all other fates. For decreased glymphatic clearance
during sleep deprivation to increase soluble CSF Ab, a
decrease in irreversible losses (eg, to the bloodstream or
lymphatics) due to prolonged overnight waking would
have to be perfectly matched by an increase in Ab clear-
ance to CSF. This is plausible but unlikely and not iden-
tifiable from the current data. The SILK kinetics results
unequivocally show that glymphatic clearance alone,
without compensation from other clearance mechanisms,
would be ineffective in protecting the brain from AD
because overall clearance rates do not change. Glym-
phatic clearance may potentially contribute to the protec-
tive effects of sleep against AD, but changes in produc-
tion rate seem to be the necessary and critical factor.
This pilot study provides the first evidence in
humans that Ab production is the mechanism for sleep-
mediated changes in Ab concentration. We did not find
that increased SWS from sodium oxybate decreased Ab
compared to controls, possibly because time in SWS was
not significantly different between the sleep-induced and
control groups. Also, our study excluded participants with
sleep disturbances; further decreasing Ab with sleep
enhancement may not be feasible in normal subjects.
Given that there are many approved therapies targeting
sleep, the effect of sleep-inducing drugs on CSF Ab should
be tested in individuals with sleep disruption and promis-
ing candidates investigated in AD prevention trials.

FIGURE 3: Amyloid b (Ab) stable isotope labeling kinetics (SILK) model sensitivity analyses. SILK modeling of normalized mole
fraction of labeled Ab40 from 1 participant was performed (black). (A) All model parameters were held constant except for
production rate. Production rate was changed to 199% (green) and 1% of the nominal production rate (red). Production rate
did not alter the best model fit of the SILK data, and the labeling curves are identical. (B) All model parameters were held con-
stant except for fractional turnover rate (FTR). FTR was changed to 105% (green) and 95% (red) of the nominal FTR. Increased
FTR by 5% results in a higher and earlier peak (green dashed line) compared to decreasing FTR by 5% (red dashed line). (C) All
model parameters were held constant except for FTR. FTR was changed to 120% (green) and 80% (red) of the nominal FTR.
Increased FTR results in a higher, narrower, and earlier peak (green dashed line), whereas decreased FTR delayed peak onset
and widened the labeling curve (red dashed line).
