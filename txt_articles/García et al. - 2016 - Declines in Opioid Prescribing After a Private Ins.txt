Overdose deaths involving opioid pain medications are 
epidemic in the United States, in part because of high opioid 
prescribing rates and associated abuse of these drugs (1). In 
2014, nearly 2 million U.S. residents either abused or were 
dependent on prescription opioids (2). In Massachusetts, 
unintentional opioid-related overdose deaths, including deaths 
involving heroin, increased 45% from 2012 to 2013.* In 2014, 
the rate of these deaths reached 20.0 per 100,000, nearly 
2.5 times higher than the U.S. rate overall (3,4). On July 1, 
2012, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts (BCBSMA), 
the largest insurer in the state with approximately 2.8 million 
members,† implemented a comprehensive opioid utilization 
program after learning that many of its members were receiv-
ing new prescriptions with a >30-day supply of opioids. The 
2016 CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic 
Pain recommends avoiding opioids as a first-line therapy for 
chronic pain and limiting quantities when initiating opioids for 
acute pain (5). CDC analyzed BCBSMA prescription claims 
data for the period 2011–2015 to assess the effect of the new 
utilization program on opioid prescribing rates. During the 
first 3 years after policy implementation, the average monthly 
prescribing rate for opioids decreased almost 15%, from 34 per 
1,000 members to 29. The percentage of BCBSMA members 
per month with current opioid prescriptions also declined. 
The temporal association between implementation of the pro-
gram and statistically significant declines in both prescribing 
rates and proportion of members using opioids suggests that 
the BCBSMA initiative played a role in reducing the use of 
prescription opioids among its members. Public and private 
insurers in the United States could benefit from developing 
their own best practices for prescription opioid utilization 
that ensure accessible pain care, while reducing the risk for 
dependence and abuse associated with these drugs. 
In 2012, BCBSMA analyzed its 2011 pharmacy claims data 
to determine the number of members receiving large quanti-
ties of opioid prescriptions from multiple providers. In 2011, 
approximately 30,000 members received new prescriptions 
of short-acting opioids with a >30-day supply; 25% of these 
members obtained opioid prescriptions from multiple pro-
viders. BCBSMA’s opioid utilization program was developed

collaboratively among an extensive network of stakeholders, 
including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, actuaries, lawyers, 
data analysts, medical societies, medical and pharmacy boards, 
the Massachusetts Pain Initiative, and the top 10 opioid-
dispensing pharmacies in Massachusetts (Box).
The BCBSMA prescription opioid utilization program 
was designed around expert-defined best practices for opioid 
prescribing that include formal agreements between patient 
and provider, a requirement for BCBSMA approval prior to 
dispensing new opioid prescriptions, and quantity limits.§ 
The program requires providers to conduct a risk assessment 
for abuse that the patient must sign. Physicians and patients 
work together to develop a treatment plan that considers 
options other than prescription opioids. When the decision 
to prescribe opioids is made, a formal agreement between 
patient and prescriber outlines specific behaviors expected 
of both parties. In addition, the prescriber must provide a 
diagnosis and rationale for prescribing an opiate as part of 
the prior authorization process. BCBSMA coverage requires 
prior authorization (including review by a BCBSMA clini-
cian who then notifies the pharmacy) before dispensing new 
short-acting opioid prescriptions with a >30-day supply and 
for all new long-acting opioid prescriptions. Pharmacy mail 
orders are not permitted. If opioid misuse is suspected or if 
coordination of care among multiple providers is indicated, 
patients might be assigned a single pharmacy to dispense all 
opioid prescriptions. Identified patients with chronic pain are 
referred to case managers who advise on nonopioid therapies. 
Oncology patients and terminally ill persons are exempt from 
the requirements for prior authorization for new prescriptions. 
Members continue to have coverage for physical therapy, pain 
management, addiction treatment, chiropractic services, and 
cognitive behavioral therapy.
A retrospective analysis was conducted using BCBSMA 
prescription claims data from the period July 2011–June 2015. 
The pre-implementation period was defined as July 1, 2011–
June 30, 2012, and the postimplementation period was defined 
as July 1, 2012–June 30, 2015. All data were deidentified 
before analysis. Average monthly prescribing rates per 1,000 
members and percentage of members with opioid prescriptions 
were calculated for short-acting,¶ long-acting,** and for both 
opioid types combined. Average monthly counts of opioid 
prescriptions for oncology members were also tabulated. To 
assess the effects of the opioid utilization program, preprogram

 ¶ Short-acting opioids in the BCBSMA opioid utilization program include 
short-acting formulations of acetaminophen/caffeine/dihydrocodeine, 
acetaminophen/codeine, acetaminophen/hydrocodone, acetaminophen/

and postprogram rates were modeled using an interrupted time 
series analysis. Outcomes were the proportions of members 
with prescriptions per month and number of prescriptions per 
total members per month; changes in rates were estimated by 
two regression coefficients, one for each period. Differences 
were considered statistically significant if the 95% confidence 
interval for the coefficient corresponding to the difference in 
slopes excluded zero. Prescriptions for buprenorphine, indi-
cated for the treatment of opioid use disorder, were examined 
separately to determine how prior authorization requirements 
impact dispensing of drugs used in medication-assisted treat-
ment. Changes in prescribing are reported for all commercial 
members eligible for BCBSMA pharmacy benefits (excluding 
patients receiving Medicare benefits).
An average of 1.5 million commercial members with phar-
macy benefits were enrolled in BCBSMA each month during 
the study period. The average monthly prescribing rate for all 
opioids decreased 14.7%, from 34 per 1,000 before implemen-
tation of the program to 29 after implementation (Table 1). 
Although the average monthly prescribing rates for long-
acting opioids remained constant at three per 1,000 members 
before and after program implementation periods, the average 
monthly prescribing rate for short-acting opioids decreased 
16.1%, from 31 to 26 per 1,000 members (Figure 1). Similarly, 
while the percentage of all members with a long-acting opioid 
prescription decreased 8.3%, from 0.24% per month to 0.22%, 
the percentage of members with short-acting opioid prescrip-
tions decreased 12.9%, from 2.49% per month to 2.17% after 
program implementation (Figure 2). The number of members 
with cancer diagnoses was not available to calculate opioid 
prescribing rates; however, the average monthly number of 
opioid prescriptions dispensed to members with cancer diag-
noses declined 9% following program implementation, which 
was less than among all members.
Results of the interrupted time series analysis showed a 
6%–9% annual decline in the percentage of members on 
short-acting and long-acting opioid prescriptions and in 
opioid prescribing rates after implementation of the opioid 
utilization program compared with the pre-implementation 
period (Table 2). All differences were statistically significant, 
regardless of medication type. Overall, the estimated quantity 
of opioids dispensed before and after implementation of the 
program indicate that approximately 21 million fewer opioid 
doses were dispensed in the first 3 years after implementation. 
Data on prior authorization requirements for buprenorphine 
indicated for the treatment of opioid use disorder, show 
that 17% of members with these prescriptions never sought 
subsequent authorization to fill them following a pharmacy 
declining to fill a prescription.
Discussion
After implementation of an opioid utilization program in 
July 2012, the number of opioid prescriptions and the per-
centage of members with an opioid prescription significantly 
decreased among BCBSMA members. However, it is possible

that other events, such as changes in policies and media cover-
age, contributed to the decline. Although the declines in aver-
age monthly prescribing rate and the percentage of BCBSMA 
members with opioid prescriptions appear modest, these 
data represent significant changes for a 2.8 million-member 
health plan. In the postimplementation period, the average 
monthly number of prescriptions for short-acting and long-
acting opioids decreased by 14,000. The prior authorization 
requirement for new short-acting opioid prescriptions for 
>30 days prompts providers to evaluate the medical neces-
sity of initiating opioids for extended periods, along with 
the concomitant risks. The decreases in dispensed opioids 
were highest for short-acting opioids, which also account 
for most of the opioid prescriptions. In accordance with a 
Massachusetts statute, the prior authorization requirement 
was changed to >21 days in August 2016.††
For nearly one in five patients, the pharmacy did not fill a 
buprenorphine prescription because it did not meet criteria 
and the patient did not subsequently seek authorization. The 
rejection might have occurred because the provider wrote the 
prescription for an off-label use or because the daily dosage was 
not within recommended parameters. Additional analyses by

BCBSMA found that nearly one third of patients were receiv-
ing these prescriptions from multiple providers, indicating a 
potential problem with poorly coordinated care. Whereas prior 
authorization might prevent misuse or diversion of buprenorphine, 
it might also be a barrier to medication-assisted treatment. Insurers 
can weigh the benefits and harms of requiring prior authorization 
for drugs used as part of medication-assisted treatment to determine 
what is most effective for their member population. 
Although oncology patients were exempt from prior 
authorization requirements for new prescription opioids, 
the number of opioid prescriptions also declined among 
these patients following program implementation. Insurers 
frequently observe a sentinel effect following a new drug uti-
lization program in which provider behaviors extend to their 
entire patient populations (6). Effective management of pain 
is a core component of quality end-of-life care and care for 
patients with serious advanced illness. To avoid unintentionally 
limiting access to pain medication for these patients, insurers 
can evaluate how policies affect this population to ensure that 
comprehensive care addresses their specific needs, including 
pain management. Data are not available on the impact of the 
decrease in prescribing among BCBSMA oncology patients on 
their pain management and functioning. However, in the 4 
years since program launch, the only appeal of a claim related 
to the insurer’s policy resulted from a clerical error, suggesting 
that these members continue to receive medically appropriate 
access to pain medication.

The findings in this report are subject to at least four limita-
tions. First, rates for nononcology opioid prescriptions might 
be underestimated by the inclusion of oncology members in 
the denominator, but the impact on trends is likely minimal 
because of the relatively small number of members who are 
oncology patients. Second, the role of other factors that 
potentially affected prescribing rates during this period (e.g., 
media coverage of opioids, increased use of the prescription 
monitoring program, and overlapping policy changes) could 
not be evaluated. In 2012, for example, the Massachusetts state 
legislature provided a statutory directive to address prescription 
drug abuse (7). Effective October 2014, the Drug Enforcement 
Administration rescheduled hydrocodone combination prod-
ucts to schedule II,§§ which was followed by a decrease in 
hydrocodone prescribing at the national level (8). Although 
tramadol is a frequently prescribed opioid, it was excluded from 
the program. As a Schedule IV opioid, tramadol has a lower 
potential for abuse than Schedule II and Schedule III opioids; 
it is possible that providers, cognizant of the risks associated 
with opioids, altered their prescribing behaviors and substituted 
tramadol where possible. However, tramadol prescribing data 
from BCBSMA show neither an increasing nor decreasing 
trend, indicating tramadol substitution was not likely. Third, 
these results reflect a privately insured population and might 
not be generalizable to other populations, including persons 
covered under public health plans. Finally, it is not known 
from these data how patient pain and function were affected 
by limiting access to opioid prescriptions.
  State and federal initiatives to address the opioid epidemic 
in the United States have been implemented in the past several 
years, with some resulting in reduced opioid prescribing (8,9). 
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services initiative 
targets three priority areas: improving opioid prescribing prac-
tices, distribution of naloxone to reverse overdoses, and access 
to medication-assisted treatment (10). The significant decrease 
in dispensing of opioids immediately after the implementation 
of the BCBSMA opioid utilization program suggests that this 
intervention played a role in the reduction of the observed 
monthly prescription rate. As part of quality improvement 
efforts, public and private insurers can implement policies 
that promote best practices in opioid prescribing to reduce risk 
among their members while ensuring access to appropriate pain 
management. The CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for 
Chronic Pain (5), released March 2016, supports this effort 
and provides a comprehensive list of recommendations that 
can inform insurer opioid utilization programs and policies.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Overdose deaths involving opioid pain medications have 
reached epidemic levels in the United States, in part because of 
high opioid prescribing rates. Health systems and insurers play 
an important role in the delivery and management of pain care.
What is added by this report?
A private insurer implemented a comprehensive opioid utiliza-
tion policy that included treatment plans, risk assessments, 
patient-provider agreements, requirements for dispensing from a 
single pharmacy, prior authorizations, quantity limits, and a ban 
on mail-order opioid prescriptions. Following implementation, 
monthly opioid prescribing rates and percentage of members 
with opioid prescriptions declined significantly.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Public health agencies and private health insurers can collabo-
rate to ensure that both public and private insurers promote 
best practices in opioid prescribing.
