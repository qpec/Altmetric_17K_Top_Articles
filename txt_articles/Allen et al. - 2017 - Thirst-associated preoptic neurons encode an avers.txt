Water deprivation produces a drive to seek and consume water. How neural activity creates
this motivation remains poorly understood. We used activity-dependent genetic labeling to
characterize neurons activated by water deprivation in the hypothalamic median preoptic
nucleus (MnPO). Single-cell transcriptional profiling revealed that dehydration-activated
MnPO neurons consist of a single excitatory cell type. After optogenetic activation of these
neurons, mice drank water and performed an operant lever-pressing task for water reward
with rates that scaled with stimulation frequency.This stimulation was aversive, and
instrumentally pausing stimulation could reinforce lever-pressing. Activity of these neurons
gradually decreased over the course of an operant session.Thus, the activity of dehydration-
activated MnPO neurons establishes a scalable, persistent, and aversive internal state
that dynamically controls thirst-motivated behavior.
T
o maintain homeostasis and ensure survival,
physiological imbalances produce motiva-
tional drives: internal states that promote
specific goal-directed behaviors and scale
in duration, intensity, and valence (1–5).
The classical “drive reduction” hypothesis posits
that animals learn particular goal-directed behav-
iors to reduce the level of an aversive drive state
(1, 2, 6). However, electrical stimulationexperiments
of putative hunger- and thirst-regulating nuclei
indicate that motivational states increase the in-
centive value of stimuli or behaviors that led to
reward (4, 7, 8). Recent experiments show that
both positive and negative valence mechanisms
appear to play a role in controlling feeding (9–14).
By contrast, the neural mechanisms for the thirst
motivational drive remain poorly understood.
The lamina terminalis of the hypothalamus
has been implicated in water intake in mammals
through lesion, optogenetic stimulation, and ac-
tivity recording(10, 15–20). In particular, the median
preoptic nucleus (MnPO) integrates blood vol-
ume, osmolarity, and hormonal inputs from the
circumventricular subfornical organ (SFO) and
vascular organ of the lamina terminalis (OVLT)
and broadcasts this information to multiple higher
brain areas (21). This architecture makes MnPO
potentially well suited to play a central role in
producing thirst motivational drive. However,
MnPO is a highly heterogeneous nucleus that
regulates body temperature, sleep, cardiovascular
function, and sodium excretion, in addition to
thirst (21). It remains unknown how the activity
of specific populations of neurons within this
area regulates thirst motivation.
Water deprivation induces robust expression
of Fos in several hypothalamic nuclei, including
MnPO (22, 23). To genetically access these cells,
we used a new FosTRAP transgenic mouse line
(24), TRAP2, in which 2A-iCreERT2 was knocked
into the Fos locus to create an in-frame fusion
(25) (Fig. 1A). In TRAP2;Ai14 double transgenic
mice, neuronal activation results in the expression
of CreER, which enters the nucleus in response to
4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) injection and causes
recombination. This results in permanent expres-
sion of tdTomato (Cre reporter from Ai14) in
active neurons (24–26) (Fig. 1B). Injecting 4-OHT
into TRAP2;Ai14 double transgenic mice pro-
duced many more tdTomato+ neurons in the
MnPO of mice deprived of water for 48 hours
(Thirst-TRAP) compared with water-satiated con-
trols (Homecage-TRAP) (Fig. 1, C, D, and F). We
compared Thirst-TRAP with endogenous Fos
protein expression after 48 hours of water dep-
rivation. TRAP2 labeling in MnPO had high effi-
ciency (65% of Fos+ cells were tdTomato+) and
specificity (96% of tdTomato+ cells were Fos+) (Fig.
1G). By contrast, few MnPO cells were double
labeled with Fos after 48 hours of water depriva-
tion in Homecage-TRAP mice (Fig. 1, C, E, and H).
TRAP2 also efficiently and specifically labeled
cells in other hypothalamic nuclei that exhib-
ited high Fos induction upon water deprivation
(fig. S1).
MnPO also contains neurons involved in thermo-
regulation (27), and warm ambient temperature
can cause robust MnPO Fos induction (28). After
Thirst-TRAP, we challenged mice with a 37°C
warm environment for 4 hours before sacrifice.
Warmth-induced Fos was expressed in a spatially
intermingled but nonoverlapping population com-
pared with Thirst-TRAPed cells in MnPO (Fig. 1,
C, E, and H).
Because MnPO and the surrounding medial
preoptic area (MPOA) are highly molecularly
heterogeneous,weappliedsingle-cellRNAsequenc-
ing (29) to determine the full spectrum of TRAPed
cell types. After Thirst-TRAP, we used fluorescence-
activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate tdTomato+
neurons (~1% of viable cells) from microdissected
preoptic hypothalamus and sequenced cDNA
from each cell (Fig. 2A and fig. S2). Our micro-
dissection included neurons in both target MnPO
and the surrounding MPOA that appeared in
both the Homecage- and Thirst-TRAP conditions.
Dimensionality reduction and clustering of 348
single-cell transcriptomes that passed quality con-
trol revealed two clusters: a mostly inhibitory
Cluster 1 (Gad1+ encoding a biosynthetic enzyme
for g-aminobutyric acid) (N = 172 cells) and a
predominantly excitatory Cluster 2 (Slc17a6+ en-
coding a vesicular transporter for glutamate)
(N = 176 cells) (Fig. 2, B to E, and table S1). Many
of the top Cluster 1 genes were broadly expressed
throughout the preoptic area (fig. S3A), and
Cluster 1 exhibited substantial heterogeneity, in-
cluding cells constitutively expressing the imme-
diate early genes Fos, Egr1, and Junb (fig. S3B).
By contrast, Cluster 2 was not clearly separable
into subclusters and was characterized by high
expression of specific receptors (e.g., the angio-
tensin II receptor Agtr1a), neuropeptides (e.g.,
Nxph4 and Adcyap1), and transcription factors
(e.g., Etv1) (Fig. 2C). Many Cluster 2 genes were
highly expressed specifically in MnPO (fig. S3A),
including Nxph4, Adcyap1, and Bdnf, previously
described as enriched in warm-associated MnPO
neurons (27), as well as Agtr1a specific to thirst-
associated neurons. Agtr1a’s endogenous agonist,
angiotensin II (ANG II), has long been implicated
in regulating water balance within the lamina
terminalis (30). These results suggest that Cluster 2
represents a distinct cell type of thirst-associated
neurons within MnPO.
We validated this conclusion by examining the
colocalization between marker genes and TRAPed
preoptic neurons in situ. Using three-color am-
plified single-molecule fluorescence in situ hy-
bridization (smFISH) (31), we simultaneously
mapped the locations of tdTomato+, Gad1+
(inhibitory), and Slc17a6+ (excitatory) neurons.
Whereas 90% of tdTomato+Gad1+ neurons were
outside MnPO, 91% of tdTomato+Slc17a6+ neu-
rons were within MnPO (N = 2 mice, Fig. 2, F
and G). Double smFISH between tdTomato and
top Cluster 2 genes Adcyap1, Agtr1a, or Nxph4
revealed that for each marker gene, tdTomato+
cells represented less than a third of the total pop-
ulation of marker+ cells within MnPO (double+/
marker+ = 28, 31, and 28%, respectively). How-
ever, the vast majority of tdTomato+ cells within
MnPO coexpressed each marker gene (double+/
tdTomato+ = 91, 89, and 98%, respectively, N =
3 mice; pie chart in Fig. 2, H to J). Thus, Thirst-
TRAPed MnPO neurons appeared to consti-
tute a single, molecularly defined cell type.
If these Thirst-TRAPed MnPO neurons encode
thirst motivational drive, then their suppression
in water-deprived animals should inhibit, while
their reactivation in water-satiated animals should
elicit, water consumption. We delivered virally
encoded Cre-dependent iC++-2A-eYFP (enhanced

 yellow fluorescent protein) (32) (inhibitory opsin)
or ChR2-eYFP (33) (excitatory opsin) to the MnPO
of TRAP2 mice and induced recombination after
48 hours of water deprivation, then delivered
light to MnPO via a fiber implant (Fig. 3, A and
B). Photoinhibition reduced water consumption
in water-deprived Thirst-TRAPed mice but not
water-deprived Homecage-TRAPed mice (Fig. 3C).
By contrast, photoactivation of these neurons in
water-satiated animals rapidly evoked water con-
sumption, which terminated upon cessation of
stimulation (Fig. 3D). The rate of water consump-
tion scaled with the frequency of photoactivation
[one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test
for linear trend; P < 0.001] (Fig. 3E), whereas
Homecage-TRAPed animals never drank water
when photostimulated (Fig. 3F). Patch-clamp
recordings in acute slices showed that ChR2-
expressing Thirst-TRAPed MnPO neurons re-
sponded with high fidelity to photoactivation at
20 Hz (fig. S4, A and B), and optogenetic stim-
ulation 90 min before sacrifice induced a drastic
increase in Fos expression, specifically in Thirst-
TRAPed MnPO (fig. S4, C and D). Stimulation of
Thirst-TRAPed neurons in water-satiated mice
did not cause undirected gnawing or licking be-
haviors (movie S1).
To determine whether activation of MnPO
neurons simply causes water consumption or
can motivate mice to perform an operant task
for water, we water-restricted mice and trained
them in a fixed ratio 1 (FR1) operant task, where
each lever press leads to a unit of water reward.
After training, mice were allowed free access
to water and tested on the task while water-
satiated. Photoactivation in water-satiated mice
rapidly induced lever-pressing for water (Fig. 3G),
the rate of which scaled with the frequency of
stimulation (one-way ANOVA test for linear
trend; P < 0.001) (Fig. 3H), whereas stimulation
of Homecage-TRAPed neurons had no effect on
behavior (Fig. 3I).
Classical theories of learning and motivation
suggestthatdeviationsfromhomeostaticsetpoints
are aversive and that animals perform motivated
behaviors to reduce such aversive states (1, 2, 4).
Consistent with this theory, real-time place pref-
erence assay revealed that mice vigorously avoided
the photoactivation of Thirst-TRAPed but not
Homecage-TRAPed neurons (Fig. 3, J and K).
These data suggested that a reduction in the
activity of Thirst-TRAPed MnPO neurons alone
might be reinforcing. Indeed, mice learned to
vigorously lever-press to turn off photoactivation
of Thirst-TRAPed (but not Homecage-TRAPed)
neurons over several 30-min sessions (Fig. 3L).
Thirst-TRAPed mice would lever-press consistently
for the whole duration of the session without
any signs of satiation (Fig. 3M). The number of
rewarded lever presses scaled with the frequency
of stimulation (one-way ANOVA test for linear
trend; P < 0.05) (Fig. 3N), suggesting that higher
levels of Thirst-TRAPed MnPO neuron activity
are more aversive and that the reduction in
activity is more reinforcing.
The activity representing this aversive drive
state must interface with other brain systems
to produce coordinated goal-directed behavior.
We found prominent axonal projections to sev-
eral other subcortical areas, including lateral
hypothalamus(LH),paraventricularhypothalamus
(PVH), paraventricular thalamus (PVT), and supra-
optic nucleus (SON) (fig. S5A). Optogenetic stimu-
lation of MnPO increased the number of Fos+ cells
in PVT, PVH, and SON of Thirst-TRAPed mice
relative to Homecage-TRAPed mice (fig. S5, B to
D). Stimulation of ChR2-expressingThirst-TRAPed
MnPO neuron axon terminals in PVH, PVT, and
LH all produced both water-drinking and FR1
lever-pressing in water-satiated mice (fig. S5, E
to G). Even though individual MnPO neurons
displayed limited collateralization (fig. S6), we
cannot rule out the possibility that some of
these effects were caused by back-propagating
action potentials spreading from the stimulated
area to other brain areas via collaterals. Finally,
Cre-dependent transsynaptic rabies tracing from
Thirst-TRAPed MnPO neurons revealed inputs
from PVH, PVT, and thirst-related hypothalamic
nuclei such as SFO and SON, as well as from the
central amygdala (CeA) and parabrachial nucleus
(PBN), which could relay other forms of sensory,
valence, or satiety information (34, 35) (fig. S7).
Finally, we investigated the in vivo dynamics
of Thirst-TRAPed MnPO neurons during thirst-
motivated behaviors. MnPO neurons respond
to changes in blood osmolarity and circulating
ANG II concentration, presumably via inputs
from OVLT and SFO (36, 37). MnPO neuron
activity is presumed to decrease upon water
intake but could potentially exhibit one of the
following patterns (Fig. 4A). First, the activity
decrease could be purely anticipatory: When
animals sense the access to water, their MnPO
activity immediately decreases. Second, these
neurons could integrate water consumption
over time. Third, these neurons could remain
active and continue to drive behavior until a
satiety signal is engaged that shuts off MnPO
activity.
We expressed Cre-dependent GCaMP6 (38) in
Thirst-TRAPed MnPO neurons and used fiber
photometry to record changes in their activity
during behavior (39) (Fig. 4, B and C). Free water
consumption by thirsty mice rapidly decreased
MnPO neuronal activity within ~1 min, similar
to that of SFONos1 (20) neurons, with the de-
crease coinciding with the period spent licking
for water (Fig. 4, D and E). Mice licking an
empty bottle had no decrease in activity (Fig. 4,
E and I). MnPO neurons also increased activity
in response to 3 M saline injection and had no
response to isotonic phosphate-buffered saline
injection (fig. S8). However, because thirsty
mice rapidly consume freely available water, it
was difficult to discriminate between the vari-
ous models relating MnPO activity to motivated
behavior.
To reduce the rate of water consumption, we
trained these mice on an FR1 operant task and
recorded activity during task performance while
the mice were water restricted. Lever-pressing
for water resulted in a gradual decrease in MnPO
activity over many minutes, much more slowly
than during free drinking (Fig. 4G). The time
when activity reached a minimum coincided
with a decrease in the rate of licking and lever-
pressing (Fig. 4G). When mice were put on an
extinction schedule, with no water delivered for
lever-pressing, there was no decrease in activity
(Fig. 4, G and I). Control mice expressing YFP
had no change in fluorescence during any behav-
ior (fig. S9). We measured how quickly Thirst-
TRAPed MnPO neuron activity decreased in an
even slower FR6 task, where six lever presses
yielded a unit of water. In this condition, the
rate of reinforcements was lower than for FR1,
as was the rate of decrease of MnPO activity
over time (Fig. 4, H and J). Directly comparing
the rates of licking over time between free access
to water, FR1, and FR6, we found that mice
tended to lick for progressively longer across
these conditions (Fig. 4J), and activity correspond-
ingly decreased more slowly as mice received
water at a slower rate (Fig. 4, K and L). This slow
time course of activity decrease, which correlated
with progressive water intake, is inconsistent with
the anticipation and satiation models; instead,
MnPO neuron activity appears to integrate water
intake over time.
Genetic access of activated neurons has emerged
as an important tool to dissect neural circuit
function (40). Using TRAP2 (25), we show that
the physiological imbalance following water dep-
rivation produces a motivational drive encoded
in the activity of a molecularly defined neuronal
type within hypothalamic MnPO. This drive is
aversive, scales with the activation frequency of
thirst-associated MnPO neurons, and persists in
driving behavior over long periods of time. The
real-time reduction in activity of these neurons is
reinforcing and, as such, is capable of condition-
ing instrumental behavior. The activity of these
neurons integrates the recent history of water
intake to adaptively regulate goal-directed behav-
ior. When thirsty, animals perform actions that
lead to water consumption, which reduces the
aversive MnPO activity by some amount. These
actions are repeated until enough water is con-
sumed that the level of aversion ceases to evoke
behavior. In doing so, an association is formed
between particular actions and reduction of an
aversive state, which would contribute to making
those actions more likely to be repeated when the
animal is thirsty again in the future. Together, our
results suggest a mechanism for the implemen-
tation of thirst motivational drive in MnPO neu-
rons that resembles the classical drive-reduction
hypothesis (1, 2, 4). MnPO thirst neurons are con-
nected to a variety of other brain regions (figs. S5
to S7) that could translate thirst drive into specific
goal-directed actions. The extent to which thirst-
motivated behaviors arise from negative-valence
drive reduction mechanisms working in conjunc-
tionwith separate positive-valence incentive mech-
anisms in these downstream circuits remains to be
explored.
