Abstract
Background—The administration of endocrine therapy for 5 years substantially reduces 
recurrence rates during and after treatment in women with early-stage, estrogen-receptor (ER)–
positive breast cancer. Extending such therapy beyond 5 years offers further protection but has 
additional side effects. Obtaining data on the absolute risk of subsequent distant recurrence if 
therapy stops at 5 years could help determine whether to extend treatment.
Methods—In this meta-analysis of the results of 88 trials involving 62,923 women with ER-
positive breast cancer who were disease-free after 5 years of scheduled endocrine therapy, we used 
Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression analyses, stratified according to trial and treatment, to assess 
the associations of tumor diameter and nodal status (TN), tumor grade, and other factors with 
patients’ outcomes during the period from 5 to 20 years.
Results—Breast-cancer recurrences occurred at a steady rate throughout the study period from 5 
to 20 years. The risk of distant recurrence was strongly correlated with the original TN status. 
Among the patients with stage T1 disease, the risk of distant recurrence was 13% with no nodal 
involvement (T1N0), 20% with one to three nodes involved (T1N1–3), and 34% with four to nine 
nodes involved (T1N4–9); among those with stage T2 disease, the risks were 19% with T2N0, 
26% with T2N1–3, and 41% with T2N4–9. The risk of death from breast cancer was similarly

 dependent on TN status, but the risk of contralateral breast cancer was not. Given the TN status, 
the factors of tumor grade (available in 43,590 patients) and Ki-67 status (available in 7692 
patients), which are strongly correlated with each other, were of only moderate independent 
predictive value for distant recurrence, but the status regarding the progesterone receptor (in 
54,115 patients) and human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) (in 15,418 patients in 
trials with no use of trastuzumab) was not predictive. During the study period from 5 to 20 years, 
the absolute risk of distant recurrence among patients with T1N0 breast cancer was 10% for low-
grade disease, 13% for moderate-grade disease, and 17% for high-grade disease; the 
corresponding risks of any recurrence or a contralateral breast cancer were 17%, 22%, and 26%, 
respectively.
Conclusions—After 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy, breast-cancer recurrences continued 
to occur steadily throughout the study period from 5 to 20 years. The risk of distant recurrence was 
strongly correlated with the original TN status, with risks ranging from 10 to 41%, depending on 
TN status and tumor grade. (Funded by Cancer Research UK and others.)
IN ESTROGEN-RECEPTOR (ER)–POSITIVE early-stage breast cancer, 5 years of 
adjuvant endocrine therapy substantially reduces the risks of locoregional and distant 
recurrence, contralateral breast cancer, death from breast cancer, and hence death from any 
cause.1–3 In trials of 5 years of tamoxifen therapy versus no endocrine therapy, the 
recurrence rate in the tamoxifen group was approximately 50% lower than that in the control 
group during the first 5 years (the treatment period) and approximately 30% lower during 
the next 5 years. The rate of death from breast cancer in the tamoxifen group was 
approximately 30% lower than that in the control group during the first 15 years (i.e., 
including 10 years after the cessation of therapy).2 In trials comparing an aromatase 
inhibitor versus tamoxifen in postmenopausal women, the aromatase inhibitor was even 
more effective than tamoxifen, with about one third fewer recurrences during the treatment 
period (but with little further gain thereafter) and with approximately 15% fewer deaths from 
breast cancer during the first decade.3
Extending adjuvant endocrine therapy (with either tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor) 
beyond 5 years can further reduce recurrence.4–9 For some women, however, receiving 
endocrine therapy for 5 years causes appreciable side effects, such as menopausal symptoms 
and arthropathy, which could continue with extended treatment.9–11 Much less common, 
but potentially life-threatening, side effects of adjuvant endocrine therapy include pulmonary 
embolus and endometrial cancer associated with tamoxifen and osteoporotic fracture 
associated with aromatase inhibitors, and the cumulative risk of these toxic events increases 
with longer treatment.2,3,5,6,9
Thus, decisions about extending adjuvant endocrine therapy after 5 years without any 
recurrence need to balance additional benefits against additional side effects. Since the 
proportional reduction in recurrence from a given regimen appears to be approximately 
similar in different risk groups,2,3,6 the absolute benefits of continuing endocrine therapy 
after 5 years depend on the absolute risk of later recurrence if no further therapy is given. 
Here, we report the influence of various characteristics of the original tumor on the 20-year 
incidence of breast-cancer outcomes in women with ER-positive, early-stage breast cancer

 who were scheduled to receive adjuvant endocrine therapy for 5 years and then to stop 
therapy. Our meta-analysis combines individual patient data from 88 trials in the Early 
Breast Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) database of randomized trials.
Methods
Patients
We analyzed data from women who had ER-positive breast cancer that had been diagnosed 
before the age of 75 years and who had T1 disease (tumor diameter, ≤2.0 cm) or T2 disease 
(tumor diameter, >2.0 to 5.0 cm), fewer than 10 involved nodes (stratified according to a 
pathological nodal status of no nodes [N0], 1 to 3 nodes [N1–3], or 4 to 9 nodes [N4–9]), 
and no distant metastases. All the patients were scheduled to receive endocrine therapy for 5 
years then stop, regardless of actual adherence. Most of the patients entered the study at the 
time of diagnosis, but some entered later, having already received 2 to 5 years of endocrine 
therapy, but were scheduled to stop therapy at 5 years.
Main Outcomes
The main outcomes were the rate of distant recurrence (as defined by each trial), regardless 
of any local or contralateral events; the rate of any breast-cancer event (distant recurrence, 
locoregional recurrence, or contralateral new primary tumor, regardless of unrelated deaths); 
and the rate of death from breast cancer, as estimated by means of log-rank subtraction (i.e., 
subtracting the log-rank statistics from analyses of death without recurrence from causes 
other than breast cancer from the log-rank statistics for any death), as in previous EBCTCG 
reports.1–3
Study Oversight
All the authors participated in designing the study, writing the manuscript, and making the 
decision to submit the manuscript for publication. The members of the EBCTCG secretariat 
collected and analyzed the data and vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and 
analyses. No commercial sponsors or confidentiality agreements were involved.
Statistical Analysis
We used Kaplan–Meier analyses to assess the associations of breast-cancer outcomes with 
tumor diameter and nodal status. To smooth single-year irregularities in Kaplan–Meier 
analyses, for some subgroups we estimated the event rate in a particular time period as the 
rate (first event per patient-year) for that whole period. We used Cox regression analyses, 
stratified according to tumor and nodal (TN) status, to assess the associations of event rate 
ratios with age (<35, 35 to 44, 45 to 54, 55 to 64, and 65 to 74 years at diagnosis) and, when 
available, with tumor grade (low, moderate, or high), Ki-67 antibody expression (a marker of 
proliferation in early breast cancer: 0 to 9%, 10 to 19%, or ≥20%), and status with respect to 
progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2). All the 
analyses were stratified according to trial and study group, if more than one study group was 
assigned to receive 5-year endocrine therapy. For multigroup comparisons, the variance of 
the log risk in each group was calculated12 and used to obtain group-specific confidence 
intervals for rate ratios.

 Results
Characteristics of the Patients
Of the 500,692 women in the EBCTCG trials database, 114,867 had ER-positive, early-stage 
breast cancer and had been scheduled to receive endocrine therapy for 5 years and then stop. 
Of these women, 63% had been assigned to receive tamoxifen, 17% to receive an aromatase 
inhibitor, and 20% to receive some sequence of tamoxifen and an aromatase inhibitor (Fig. 
1). After the exclusion of patients who were 75 years of age or older at the time of diagnosis, 
those who had a tumor diameter of more than 5.0 cm, those who had more than 9 involved 
lymph nodes, and those with missing data with respect to age or TN status, a total of 74,194 
women (in 78 trials) had entered a study at the time of diagnosis and were included in 
analyses that began at year 0. We included an additional 10,200 women who had entered the 
study later (at 2, 3, or 5 years) only in analyses that began at year 5, for a total of 62,923 
women in 88 trials who were still being followed at 5 years without recurrence or a second 
cancer.
The characteristics of the women in the study are provided in Table S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. Approximately 50% of the 
women had received a diagnosis of breast cancer before 2000 (range, 1976 to 2011). All the 
women had data on age and TN status. Data were available regarding tumor grade in 43,590 
of the patients (69%), progesterone-receptor status in 54,115 (86%), HER2 status (regardless 
of the use of trastuzumab) in 24,145 (38%), and Ki-67 status in 7692 (12%). No gene-
expression profiles were available. Similar numbers of women had undergone breast-
conserving therapy and mastectomy; all the women had undergone lymph-node dissection. 
Approximately three quarters of those with node-positive disease had undergone 
chemotherapy. The receipt of chemotherapy was strongly correlated with nodal status and, in 
N0 disease, with tumor diameter and grade. Only a quarter of those with known HER2-
positive disease had been scheduled to receive trastuzumab (Table S2 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
Analyses of Data Starting at Year 0
The cumulative risk and annual rates of distant recurrence and death from breast cancer in 
each 5-year period from year 0 to year 20, subdivided according to nodal status at the time 
of diagnosis, are shown in Figure 2. Within each category of nodal status, distant recurrences 
occurred steadily throughout the 20-year period. The annual risk was strongly related 
(P<0.001) to nodal status, with a 20-year risk of distant recurrence of 22% in women with 
no positive nodes, 31% in those with one to three positive nodes, and 52% in those with four 
to nine positive nodes.
As expected in a population that was initially free of recurrence, the annual rates of death 
from breast cancer were low during the first 5 years (only about half the rates of distant 
recurrence). However, starting at year 5, the annual rates of death and distant recurrence 
were similar and the cumulative risk of death from breast cancer lagged behind that of 
distant recurrence by only a few years. Hence, the 20-year risks of death from breast cancer

 were 15% with N0 disease, 28% with N1–3 disease, and 49% with N4–9 disease — risks 
that were not much lower than the 20-year risks of distant recurrence.
Analyses Starting at Year 5
Cumulative risks and annual rates of distant recurrence in each 5-year period during the 
period from 5 to 20 years for the 62,923 women who reached year 5 without breast-cancer 
recurrence or any second cancer and who were scheduled to discontinue endocrine therapy 
are shown in Figure 3. The results are presented separately for T1 and T2 tumors and are 
subdivided according to nodal status at diagnosis. Although all the women had been 
clinically disease-free for many years, the original tumor diameter and especially the 
original nodal status remained powerful determinants of late distant recurrence, even during 
the second decade after diagnosis. Within each TN-status category, distant recurrences 
continued to occur steadily throughout the period from 5 to 20 years.
Even for women with the best prognosis, the risks were appreciable. For those with T1N0 
disease, the annual rate of distant recurrence remained approximately 1% throughout the 
period from 5 to 20 years, resulting in a cumulative risk of distant recurrence of 13% (Fig. 
3A). The associations of tumor diameter and nodal status with the risk of distant recurrence 
during the period from 5 to 20 years were approximately additive, with a progressive 
increase from 13% for T1N0 to 41% for T2N4–9 disease (Fig. 3B). Similar results were 
observed for rates of death from breast cancer (Figs. S13 through S16 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
To further explore the possibility of identifying groups at very low risk, we subdivided the 
rates of distant recurrence and of any breast-cancer event (distant, local, or contralateral) 
among women with T1N0 disease according to tumor grade and size (T1a or T1b [≤1.0 cm] 
vs. T1c [>1.0 to 2.0 cm]) (Fig. 4). Although both tumor grade and tumor size significantly 
affected prognosis in T1N0 disease, even women with T1N0 tumors that were well 
differentiated or measured 1.0 cm or less in diameter (i.e., T1a or T1b) had appreciable 
recurrence rates throughout the period from 5 to 20 years. For low-grade T1N0 disease, the 
absolute risk during the study period was 10% for distant recurrence and 17% for any breast-
cancer event (distant, local, or contralateral); the risks were similar for the combined T1a 
and T1b N0 group.
Other Prognostic Factors
The importance of TN status as a determinant of the distant-recurrence rate, and the 
additional relevance of age, tumor grade, and various tumor markers, are described 
separately for recurrences during the first 5 years and for those during the subsequent 15 
years (to year 20) (Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). The importance of TN status 
was similarly strong during both time periods, as was the importance of a young age at the 
time of diagnosis. In contrast, other factors that were of some additional relevance during the 
first 5 years were of less, or no, additional relevance thereafter, given the TN status. Tumor 
grade and the presence of Ki-67 antibody (which were strongly correlated with each other) 
were important independent factors of prognostic value during the first 5 years but were of 
only moderate relevance thereafter. Progesterone-receptor status was independently

 prognostic during years 0 to 5 but not thereafter. Only 2% of all the women in the study 
were scheduled to receive trastuzumab (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix), but in 
trials with no scheduled trastuzumab, 20,648 women had known HER2 status. Among these 
women, those with HER2-positive tumors who did not receive trastuzumab had a worse 
prognosis than those with HER2-negative tumors during years 0 to 5 but not thereafter.
Other Outcomes
Graphs showing the influence of age and tumor characteristics on absolute and relative risks 
of any breast-cancer event, death from breast cancer, locoregional recurrence, and 
contralateral breast cancer are provided in Figures S6 though S22 in the Supplementary 
Appendix. Locoregional recurrence and death from breast cancer showed much the same 
dependence on risk factors as distant recurrence. However, these risk factors were of little 
relevance to the risk of contralateral breast cancer, which continued at a rate of 
approximately 0.3% per year after the cessation of endocrine therapy, independent of age or 
TN status (Figs. S11 and S12 in the Supplementary Appendix). The risk of death without 
known recurrence depended chiefly on age but was also somewhat dependent on TN status, 
which suggests that some of these deaths were in fact from breast cancer and that 
approximately 5 to 10% of distant recurrences had been missed in trial records (Fig. S23 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
Discussion
Among women with ER-positive, early-stage breast cancer who were scheduled to receive 
only 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy, distant recurrences occurred at a steady rate for 
at least another 15 years after the end of the 5-year treatment period. Throughout this time, 
the original nodal status and tumor diameter remained remarkably strong determinants of the 
annual recurrence rate (Table 1). However, even among women with small, node-negative 
(T1N0), low-grade tumors, there was a risk of distant recurrence of approximately 10% 
during years 5 to 20. TN status was also a strong determinant of locoregional recurrence, 
although not of contralateral disease.
Given the TN status, the other risk factors were of limited additional prognostic relevance 
after the cessation of 5-year endocrine therapy. There was a strong association of tumor 
grade and Ki-67 status with the risk of distant recurrence during years 0 to 5 but only a 
moderate association during years 5 to 20. Data regarding tumor grade and Ki-67 status 
were sometimes from local institutions, so accuracy could be variable, but both factors were 
strongly predictive of 5-year risk, which suggests that these values were assessed with 
reasonable accuracy. Better assessments should better predict outcome but would probably 
not alter the observed pattern of substantially weaker associations with distant recurrence 
after 5 years than before 5 years. Likewise, tumors that were negative for progesterone 
receptor had a worse prognosis during years 0 to 5 but not thereafter, given the TN status. 
The data set did not include gene-expression assays,13–17 which may be shown to predict a 
very low risk of distant recurrence even without further therapy for some women when long-
term follow-up data become available.18 However, decisions with respect to extending

 endocrine therapy will probably still depend on disease stage, so these findings will remain 
relevant.
Our main aim was to determine whether we could identify subgroups of women who stop 
endocrine therapy after 5 years in whom long-term risks are so small that any additional 
benefits from extended therapy would be unlikely to outweigh the additional side effects. 
However, even among women with T1N0 disease, the cumulative risk of distant recurrence 
was 13% during years 5 to 20. Although reliable trial evidence is not yet available on the 
long-term effects of extending endocrine therapy for 5 additional years on mortality,5–9,19–
21 an absolute reduction of a few percentage points in the risk of distant metastases over the 
next 15 years might well be possible even for such low-risk women, with correspondingly 
greater absolute benefits for women with larger tumors or node-positive disease. Except for 
women who are older than 70 years of age or those in poor health, these probabilities will 
not be much attenuated by the risk of death from another cause, since in the absence of 
breast cancer, more than 80% of the women in the United States in reasonable health at the 
age of 65 years would be expected to survive beyond the age of 80 years.
Meta-analyses of data from individual patients will eventually reconcile any apparently 
conflicting findings from the trials of extending endocrine therapy beyond 5 years, 
especially after 5 years of aromatase inhibitor therapy.5–9,19–21 When these findings are 
available, the likely benefits of extending therapy will have to be weighed against 
uncommon but potentially life-threatening side effects, such as bone fracture for aromatase 
inhibitors3 and pulmonary embolus and (for women with a uterus) endometrial cancer for 
tamoxifen.2,5,6 The risks of such side effects increase with longer treatment, although the 
absolute risk of death from them is low (<0.5%).5–9
In addition, tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors can cause bothersome but non–life-
threatening side effects, including menopausal symptoms, arthropathy, and carpal tunnel 
syndrome, which adversely affect the quality of life. However, such symptoms are quite 
common even without endocrine therapy. In placebo-controlled trials7–10,22–24 that have 
systematically sought patient-reported outcomes, women in the placebo group have reported 
more than half as many episodes as those in the endocrine-therapy group, which highlights 
the importance of placebo control to assess many pharmacologic side effects. Trials have 
also shown little difference in discontinuation rates between endocrine therapy and placebo, 
although in clinical practice substantial numbers of women discontinue adjuvant endocrine 
therapy prematurely because of symptoms.25,26 However, women who have already 
completed 5 years of endocrine therapy are less at risk for unexpected symptoms than those 
who are initiating therapy.
These findings underline the need to help women who are receiving endocrine therapy to 
discover whether any symptoms are actually caused or exacerbated by therapy. Such patients 
could try stopping treatment for short periods or switching from one agent to another.26 
Switching between an aromatase inhibitor and tamoxifen, or among various aromatase 
inhibitors, is safer than discontinuing therapy prematurely.3 Adherence may also be helped 
by interventions that can mitigate some of the symptoms attributed to endocrine therapy,27 
Pan et al.

 including nonhormonal interventions that reduce menopausal symptoms,28,29 
musculoskeletal symptoms,30 sexual dysfunction,31,32 and osteoporosis.33
Our study has several limitations. First, the recurrence rates reported here are in women who 
were scheduled to receive 5 years of endocrine therapy, not in those who completed 
treatment. Only a few of the trials in our study provided detailed data with respect to 
adherence, but a substantial minority of women in trials of 5-year endocrine therapy did not 
complete their treatment.2 Because 5 years of therapy is more effective than only 2 years,1,2 
the risks among women who actually completed 5 years of therapy would be somewhat 
lower than those in our study. However, an expected lower risk with greater adherence is to 
some extent counterbalanced by unreported breast-cancer events: the association between 
TN status and the rate of death without reported recurrence suggests that some of these 
deaths were from unreported breast cancer and that the rate of distant recurrence would have 
been higher by 5 to 10% with complete ascertainment. Although a persisting recurrence risk 
among women with ER-positive breast cancer is well recognized,13–17,34 our study 
quantifies the 20-year risk more reliably than previous studies, since it is large and has long 
follow-up. However, long follow-up means that most of the patients received the breast-
cancer diagnosis well before 2000. Since then, the prognosis for women in particular TN 
categories has somewhat improved owing to earlier diagnosis, more accurate tumor staging, 
and better surgical, radiation, and systemic therapies. Gene-expression arrays have also been 
adopted to guide the use of chemotherapy in ER-positive disease, a factor that has somewhat 
affected the mix of patients receiving chemotherapy.35 However, it seems unlikely that such 
factors would have a substantive effect on the generalizability of our findings to current 
patients, since the use of chemotherapy in our cohort was similar to that in current practice 
(Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).36
Furthermore, we could not reliably assess the relevance of chemotherapy to prognosis after 
year 5, since the women who received chemotherapy and those who did not receive 
chemotherapy differed in the extent of nodal involvement, tumor size, tumor grade, and 
perhaps unrecorded selection factors. The relevance of chemotherapy to prognosis after year 
5 is best assessed in meta-analyses of the trials of chemotherapy, since randomization 
balances known and unknown risk factors between treatment groups. Previous EBCTCG 
meta-analyses have shown that most of the reduction in the recurrence rate with 
chemotherapy occurred in the first 5 years, with similar proportional reductions among 
women with ER-positive and ER-negative disease, but also indicated further benefit in years 
5 to 9 with more effective regimens.37 Thus, the risk of recurrence after 5 years may well be 
somewhat lower in women who receive contemporary chemotherapy than among those in 
our study.
In addition, only 2% of the women in our study received trastuzumab. Wider use of 
trastuzumab in women with HER2-positive disease might have improved prognosis after 5 
years,38 although again such a hypothesis would be best evaluated by meta-analyses of 
trastuzumab trials. In trials without trastuzumab, the recurrence risk in years 0 to 4 was 
higher for HER2-positive tumors than for HER2-negative tumors, but HER2 status was of 
little relevance to prognosis thereafter. Hence, although HER2 status was unknown for many

 tumors, the overall findings are applicable to women with ER-positive, HER2-negative 
disease (i.e., to most women with ER-positive disease).
In conclusion, even after 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy, women with ER-positive, 
early-stage breast cancer still had a persistent risk of recurrence and death from breast 
cancer for at least 20 years after the original diagnosis. This finding has implications for 
long-term follow-up strategies and highlights the need for new approaches to reduce late 
recurrence. The risk could be somewhat reduced by extending the duration of endocrine 
therapy,5–11 with greater absolute benefits for those at highest risk for recurrence. A major 
predictor of risk is TN status, although even among women with large, strongly node-
positive tumors, most who complete 5 years of endocrine therapy will remain free of distant 
recurrence 20 years after diagnosis. However, even low-grade T1N0 disease carries an 
appreciable risk of distant recurrence and contralateral breast cancer, a risk that is sufficient 
for at least the consideration of extended endocrine therapy. Recognition of the magnitude of 
the long-term risks of ER-positive disease can help women and their health care 
professionals decide whether to extend therapy beyond 5 years and whether to persist if 
adverse events occur.

 Figure 1. Selection of Women with Breast Cancer from 88 Trials of Adjuvant Breast-Cancer 
Therapy.
The analyses combine individual patient data from 88 trials in the Early Breast Cancer 
Trialists’ Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) database of randomized trials. All the women 
who were included in the study were scheduled to receive adjuvant endocrine therapy for 
only 5 years, regardless of actual adherence, after a diagnosis of estrogen-receptor (ER)–
positive breast cancer before the age of 75 years. A total of 74,194 women who were 
enrolled in 78 trials at the time of diagnosis were included in the analyses that began at year 
0. A total of 62,923 women who were enrolled in 88 trials either at the time of diagnosis or

 Figure 2. Association between Pathological Nodal Status and the Risk of Distant Recurrence or 
Death from Breast Cancer during the 20-Year Study Period.
Shown are data regarding the risk of distant recurrence (Panel A) and death from breast 
cancer (Panel B) among 74,194 women with ER-positive T1 or T2 disease who were 
enrolled in 78 trials at year 0 and were scheduled to receive 5 years of endocrine therapy. 
(Data for another 10,200 women who enrolled in 10 trials after year 0 are not shown here.) 
The risk was calculated according to the patients’ pathological nodal status at the time of 
diagnosis: N0, N1–3, or N4–9. The number of events and annual rate are shown for the 
preceding period (e.g., data for years 0 to 4 are shown at 5 years). The I bars indicate 95%

 confidence intervals. The dashed lines indicate that the event rate is for the whole 5-year 
period, rather than for individual years, as is otherwise shown. The annual rate of death from 
breast cancer was estimated by subtracting the death rate in women without recurrence from 
the rate in all women.

Shown are the data for 62,923 women with ER-positive disease who were enrolled in 88 
trials of breast-cancer therapy and who initiated therapy either at year 0 or within the first 5 
years, according to whether they had T1 disease (Panel A) or T2 disease (Panel B). All the 
women were scheduled to receive 5 years of endocrine therapy and were event-free and still 
being followed at year 5. The I bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. The dashed lines 
indicate that the event rate is for the whole 5-year period, rather than for individual years, as

 Figure 4. Association of Tumor Diameter and Tumor Grade with the Risk of Distant Recurrence 
or Any Breast-Cancer Event during Years 5 to 20 of the Study.
Shown are data for 19,402 women (13,941 of whom had a known tumor grade) with ER-
positive breast cancer with a tumor size of 2 cm or less with no spread to lymph nodes 
(T1N0). All the women were scheduled to receive 5 years of adjuvant endocrine therapy and 
then discontinue therapy and were event-free and being followed at year 5. The findings 
were categorized according to tumor diameter (T1a or T1b [≤1.0 cm] vs. T1c [>1.0–2.0 cm]) 
and tumor grade. Panels A and C show the risk of distance recurrence during years 5 to 20 
according to tumor diameter and tumor grade, respectively; Panels B and D show the risk of 
any breast-cancer event (distant or local recurrence or contralateral onset) during years 5 to 
20 according to tumor diameter and tumor grade, respectively. The I bars indicate 95% 
confidence intervals. The dashed lines indicate that the event rate is for the whole 5-year 
period, rather than for individual years, as is otherwise shown.
