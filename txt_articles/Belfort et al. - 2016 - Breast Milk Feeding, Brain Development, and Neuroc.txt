Abstract
Objectives—To determine the associations of breast milk intake after birth with neurological 
outcomes at term equivalent and 7 years of age in very preterm infants
Study design—We studied 180 infants born <30 weeks’ gestation or <1250 grams birth weight 
enrolled in the Victorian Infant Brain Studies cohort from 2001–2003. We calculated the number 
of days on which infants received >50% of enteral intake as breast milk from 0–28 days of life. 
Outcomes included brain volumes measured by magnetic resonance imaging at term equivalent 
and 7 years of age, and cognitive (IQ, reading, mathematics, attention, working memory, language, 
visual perception) and motor testing at years. We adjusted for age, sex, social risk,7 and neonatal 
illness in linear regression.
Results—A greater number of days on which infants received >50% breast milk was associated 
with larger deep nuclear gray matter volume at term equivalent age (0.15 cc/day, 95% CI 0.05, 
0.25); and with better performance at age 7 years on IQ (0.5 points/day, 95% CI 0.2, 0.8), 
mathematics (0.5, 95% CI 0.1, 0.9), working memory (0.5, 95% CI 0.1, 0.9), and motor function

 (0.1, 95% CI 0.0, 0.2) tests. No differences in regional brain volumes at 7 years in relation to 
breast milk intake were observed.

In healthy, full term populations, breastfeeding appears beneficial to neurodevelopment.1–3 
One proposed mechanism linking breastfeeding with brain development is the effect of 
specific nutrients in breast milk that are either absent from or present in lower amounts in 
infant formula.4 Another potential mechanism is through greater sensitivity to the infant 
shown by mothers who provide breast milk,5 because maternal sensitivity is associated with 
better neurodevelopment.6 Connections between breastfeeding and infant development may 
also be explained in part by shared social determinants such as maternal educationand 
family income, and maternal IQ.7
The effects of breast milk and breastfeeding on neurodevelopment may be quite different in 
very preterm infants than in those born full term. Nutritionally, breast milk is considered the 
optimal food for full term infants, but preterm infants require fortification to match 3rd 
trimester nutrient accretion rates.8 Even with fortification, weight gain of breast milk-fed 
infants lags behind that of infants fed preterm formula,9, 10 suggesting possible 
undernutrition. In hospitalized very preterm infants, feedings are typically given via tube 
rather than directly at the breast, thereby uncoupling the ingestion of breast milk from the 
maternal interactions that occur during the act of breastfeeding. However, the time invested 
in expressing and delivering breast milk may reflect different levels of attachment or 
sensitivity. Given these differences between preterm and term infants, focused research 
needed to evaluate the potential benefits of breast milk intake on the neurodevelopment of 
very preterm infants.
Direct imaging of the brain may shed light on mechanisms linking breast milk, brain growth, 
and neurodevelopment. In full term infants, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain 
demonstrated greater white matter development from 10 months to 4 years11 and at 8 
years12; and greater cortical thickness in adolescence13 in relation to early breastfeeding 
exposure. In preterm infants, one small study14 (n=50) found positive correlations of breast 
milk intake with total brain volume at 15 years of age. Another study15 of preterm infants 
reported that greater breast milk intake was associated with improved corpus callosum 
maturation at term equivalent age (40 weeks postmenstrual age), but infants were not 
followed beyond neonatal discharge. Additional research is needed to determine the extent 
to which breast milk intake during the neonatal period affects the preterm infant brain and 
whether effects persist beyond the newborn period.

 Our aims in this study were to examine associations of breast milk intake during the 
neonatal hospitalization with brain MRI characteristics at term equivalent and 7 years of age 
and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 and 7 years of age.
Methods
We studied participants in the Victorian Infant Brain Studies (VIBeS) longitudinal cohort. 
224 infants born <30 weeks’ gestation or <1250 grams birth weight were enrolled before 
term equivalent age at the Royal Women’s Hospital in Melbourne, Australia between July 
2001 and December 2003. Exclusion criteria included congenital anomalies likely to affect 
brain development or function. Parents provided informed consent for their children to 
participate. The Royal Women’s Hospital and Royal Children’s Hospital institutional review 
boards approved the study. For this analysis, we excluded 44 participants due to missing 
breast milk data. The remaining 180 participants had available data for at least one outcome 
(n=160 with term equivalent brain MRI; n=173 with 2 year Bayley testing; n=108 with 7 
year brain MRI; and n=161 with 7 year neurocognitive testing) and were included in the 
present analysis.
Breast milk intake
Study staff abstracted the daily volume of breast milk and formula intake for the first 28 
days of life from the medical record. We focusedon breast milk intake in the first 28 days 
with the goal of minimizing attrition due to early transfer or discharge that could bias results. 
In a subset of 20 randomly selected participants, we abstracted data on breast milk intake 
(mL/kg/day) through day 40, and found a strong correlation with intake from birth to 28 
days (Pearson r=0.95). Breast milk was fortified according to unit-based practice. Preterm 
formula was used when a mother’s own breast milk was unavailable or in short supply; 
donor breast milk was not used.
Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at term equivalent and 7 years
At term equivalent age (range, 38 to 42 weeks postmenstrual age), participants underwent 
brain MRI in a 1.5T General Electric scanner (Signa Echospeed System; Milwaukee, WI, 
USA). Infants were fed, swaddled, and placed in a supportive beanbag. No analgesia or 
sedation was given. T1 and T2/proton density weighted images were acquired.16 Structural 
images were semi-automatically segmented into white matter (unmyelinated, myelinated), 
cortical gray matter, deep nuclear gray matter (including basal ganglia and thalamus) and 
cerebrospinal fluid.17, 18 Hippocampi and cerebella were manually traced.19, 20
At 7 years (range, 6.6 to 8.1 years), participants again underwent brain MRI. Children were 
scanned on a 3 Tesla Siemens Magnetom Trio scanner, with T1 weighted images acquired 
(0.85mm sagittal slices, flip angle = 9°, repetition time = 1900ms, echo time = 2.27ms, field 
of view = 210 × 210mm, matrix= 256 × 256). Brain volumes were obtained using 
FreeSurfer, an automated imaging processing package (stable release version 4.4.0, http://
surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu), with manual editing as required. Cortical and cerebellar gray 
and white matter, deep nuclear gray matter (thalamus, nucleus accumbens, caudate, 
putamen, pallidum) were estimated and volumes combined from both hemispheres.

 Cerebellar volume was calculated as the total cerebellar white plus gray matter. Total brain 
volume was the combined volumes of all brain structures. Hippocampi were manually 
traced.21
Neurodevelopmental assessments at 2 and 7 years
Trained examiners administered the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, 2nd edition 
(Bayley-2) when children were 2 years corrected age. The Bayley-2 comprises the Mental 
Development Index (MDI), which measures cognition, and the Psychomotor Development 
Index (PDI), which measures motor skills. Domains tested at 7 years included: general 
intelligence (Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence, WASI)22; academic achievement 
(Word Reading and Math Computation subtests of the Wide Range Achievement Test, 
WRAT4)23; attention (Score subtest of the Test of Every Day Attention for Children, TEA-
Ch)24; working memory (Backward Digit Recall subtests of the Working Memory Test 
Battery for Children, WMTBC)25; language (Core Language Index from the Clinical 
Evaluation of Language Fundamentals, CELF-IV)26; visual perception (Visual Closure 
subtest of the Test of Visual Perceptual Skills, TVPS-3)27; and motor function (Movement 
Assessment Battery for Children, MABC2)28. Higher scores on all of these measures 
indicate better performance. Scores from the Bayley-2, WASI, WRAT4, WMTBC, and 
CELF-IV were age-standardized to a mean of 100 and standard deviation (SD) 15; the 
remaining tests were standardized to a mean of 10 (SD 3). We used corrected age for all 
scores. On the Bayley-2, children who fell below the basal threshold for testing were 
assigned a score of 45; children too impaired for testing were assigned a score of 40.
Covariates
Infant sex, gestational age, exposure to antenatal or postnatal corticosteroids, supplemental 
oxygen requirement at 36 weeks, and diagnosis of sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis were 
abstracted from the medical record. The Clinical Risk Index for Babies (CRIB) score is an 
illness severity indicator.29 We calculated a social risk score comprising: maternal age, 
parent marital status, education level of baby’s primary caregiver, employment status and 
income of primary income earner, and language spoken at home.30 Participants were 
categorized as being of lower (score, 0 or 1) or higher (score, 2 or higher) social risk. Using 
infant weight obtained with a digital scale at birth and at the time of the term equivalent 
MRI, we calculated the weight z-score change from birth to term equivalent age.31
Statistical Analyses
We calculated 2 measures of breast milk intake: number of days on which the infant received 
>50% of enteral intake as breast milk and mean daily breast milk intake (mL/kg/day). Main 
outcomes were regional brain volumes (term equivalent and 7 years of age) and 
neurodevelopmental test scores (2 and 7 years of age). We estimated associations between 
exposures and outcomes in linear regression, fitted using generalized estimating equations 
with an exchangeable correlation structure to account for clustering due to multiple births. In 
Model 0, we adjusted for the child’s sex, exact age at scan or assessment, and gestational 
age at birth. In Model 1, we additionally adjusted for social risk score (higher vs. lower), and 
in Model 2 we additionally included variables that reflect neonatal illness severity. In Model 
3 we included neonatal weight gain (a proxy for nutritional adequacy) to explore its

 mediating effect, hypothesizing that adjusting for weight z-score change from birth to term 
would strengthen associations of breast milk intake with outcomes, given associations of 
breast milk intake with slower weight gain9 and slower weight gain with poorer 
developmental outcomes.32, 33
Results
Table I shows characteristics of our participants, who had rates of perinatal complications 
and long-term outcomes typical of their immaturity [mean (SD) gestational age, 27.3 (1.8) 
weeks] at birth. The mean number of days from day 0–28 on which infants received breast 
milk as >50% of their feedings was 21 (SD 7). Mean breast milk intake in the first 28 days 
was 90 (SD 43) mL/kg/day. Multiple gestations comprised 45% of the cohort. As compared 
with singletons, mean breast milk intake for multiples was slightly lower (86 mL/kg/day).
Table II shows the linear associations of the estimated brain volumes at term equivalent with 
the number of days on which breast milk comprised >50% of enteral intake during the first 
28 days of life. In a model adjusted only for age, sex, and gestational age at birth (Model 0), 
for each additional day of breast milk >50% of intake, the deep nuclear gray matter volume 
was 0.11 cc/day [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.02, 0.20] larger. This association persisted 
after additional adjustment for social risk score (Model 1) and markers of neonatal illness 
(Model 2, 0.15 cc/day, 95% CI 0.05, 0.25). Additionally adjusting for neonatal weight gain 
(Model 3) did not change these estimates. Other brain volumes were not substantially 
associated with days of breast milk intake >50% (Table II). In Table III (available at 
www.jpeds.com), we show associations of average daily breast milk intake on day 0–28 with 
brain volumes at term, with evidence for a relationship with hippocampal volume (0.02 cc 
per 10 mL/kg/day breast milk, 95% CI 0.01, 0.03) that persisted after adjustment for 
covariates. Associations of average daily breast milk intake with other brain volumes 
appeared minimal (Table III).
In Table IV, we show associations of breast milk intake with estimated brain volumes at 7 
years. With adjustment for age, sex, and gestational age, the intracranial volume was larger 
(2.67 cc/day that breast milk >50% of intake, 95% CI 0.37, 4.97). With adjustment for social 
risk and neonatal illness, the estimate remained similar (2.42 cc/day), but the 95% CI 
included 0 (−0.19, 5.04). We also observed a small association with hippocampal volume 
that was attenuated with covariate adjustment (Table IV). There was little evidence of 
associations between average daily breast milk intake and other regional brain volumes at 7 
years (Table III).
There was also little evidence of associations between breast milk intake and Bayley scores 
at 2 years (Table V). Regarding 7 year outcomes, in Model 0, the full scale IQ was 0.5 points 
(95% CI 0.3, 0.8) higher for each additional day of breast milk intake >50%; estimates were 
similar with additional adjustment for covariates (Models 1–3). A similar pattern was 
observed for Verbal and Performance IQ, Math Computation, and Working Memory. Motor 
functioning was also higher with increasing days of breast milk >50% in covariate-adjusted 
models (Table IV), for example 0.1 points/day, 95% CI 0.03, 0.2 after adjustment for social 
risk and neonatal illness factors (Model 2). In Table VI (available at www.jpeds.com), we

 show similar associations of full scale IQ with average daily breast milk intake (0.7 points 
per 10 mL/kg/day, 95% CI 0.1, 1.3) that attenuated slightly with covariate adjustment. 
Positive associations of average daily breast milk intake with Working Memory were also 
noted, whereas greater breast milk intake was associated with lower Visual Perception scores 
(−0.2 points per 10 mL/kg/day, 95% CI −0.3, – 0.03 in Model 2) (Table VI).
Discussion
In a contemporary cohort of 180 very preterm infants, we found favorable associations of 
maternal breast milk intake in the first 28 days of life with neurodevelopmental outcomes at 
7 years of age. For example, IQ was 0.5 points higher per additional day that breast milk 
intake was over 50% of total enteral intake, and 0.7 points higher per additional 10 
mL/kg/day breast milk ingested. Even if residual confounding explains some of this effect, 
our results nonetheless suggest a substantial impact of breast milk intake in the first month 
of life on very preterm infant neurodevelopment assessed at school age. We also saw 
associations of breast milk intake with size of the deep nuclear gray matter and hippocampus 
at term equivalent age, although this effect was not present on brain volumes assessed at age 
7 years.
Previous studies supporting the beneficial effects of breast milk intake on neurodevelopment 
in very preterm infants have examined infant or toddler outcomes,10, 34, 35 which have 
limitations in the prediction of later cognitive abilities.36, 37 Assessment at school age as in 
the current study also allows for more detailed measurement of cognitive functioning, 
including memory, attention, and school achievement. These domains are particularly 
important to assess in very preterm infants, who are prone to difficulties in these areas.38–41
We identified only 2 studies42, 43 of very preterm or very low birth weight (VLBW, <1500 
grams) infants born in 1990 or beyond that examined breast milk intake or breastfeeding in 
relation to school age neurodevelopmental measures, as we did in this study. An analysis42 
of data from the EPIPAGE cohort of French infants <33 weeks’ gestation found that the risk 
of non-optimal neurodevelopment at age 5 years was substantially lower (odds ratio 0.7, 
95% CI 0.5, 0.9) for infants who were breastfeeding at the time of neonatal discharge vs. 
not. A notable limitation of the EPIPAGE study was the method of categorizing infants 
based on any versus no breast milk at the time of discharge. That method could have led to 
an underestimation of the effect size if many of the infants who received breast milk early in 
the hospitalization were no longer receiving it at discharge. In contrast, we had detailed data 
about the amount of breast milk ingested during the first 28 days of life. Additionally, 
EPIPAGE42 used as their outcome measure the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children 
Mental Processing Composite, which reflects general intelligence. In addition to measures of 
IQ, our study found evidence of associations between breast milk intake and measures of 
word reading and mathematics, working memory, and motor function. Overall, it appears 
that greater exposure to breast milk is associated not only with higher general intelligence, 
but also with better academic achievement, memory, and motor function in children who 
were born very preterm.

 In contrast to our results, a U.S. study43 of VLBW infants showed no advantages of feeding 
expressed breast milk or directly breast feeding through 6 months of age on a battery of tests 
at 6–8 years of age, including general intelligence, verbal ability, fine motor skills, and 
visual-spatial skills, and a small advantage on visual motor skill tests. A major difference 
from our study was their reliance on parental report of breastfeeding type and duration (<1 
week, 1–4 weeks, 4–6 months, 6 or more months), whereas we used the medical record to 
quantify the volume of breast milk ingested in the first 28 days of the neonatal 
hospitalization. It is possible that the preterm brain is more sensitive to the beneficial effects 
of breast milk earlier in development, specifically prior to term when developmental 
processes such as dendritic and axonal growth and synaptogenesis are ongoing and distinct 
from the processes that predominate after term, such as pruning and myelination.
In our study, there was little statistical evidence for associations between breast milk intake 
and Bayley scores at 2 years of age. However, the effect estimate for the MDI (0.4 points per 
day receiving >50% breast milk) was similar in magnitude to our estimate for IQ at 7 years 
(0.5 points per day), with more variability in estimates at 2 than at 7 years. In a larger 
(~1000 participants) U.S. cohort44 of extremely low birth weight (<1000 grams) infants, for 
every 10 mL/kg average daily breast milk intake, the MDI at 18 months was 0.5 points 
higher; our results were similar in magnitude (0.4 points higher). Some10 but not all34, 45 
previous studies have found similar results with outcomes measured in infancy through 
preschool age. Our study is unique in that we assessed the same children both at 2 and 7 
years of age. In a previous analysis2 of full term children who underwent cognitive 
assessment at 3 and 7 years, we found beneficial effects of greater duration and exclusivity 
of breastfeeding on cognition at 7 but not 3 years of age. It is possible that assessment early 
in childhood is too soon to detect subtle effects of breast milk that are more evident at school 
age. It is also possible that the influence of the shared determinants of breastfeeding and 
neurodevelopment – such as environmental, social, and economic factors – increases over 
time.
Another feature of our study was the analysis of regional brain volumes in relation to early 
breast milk intake in very preterm infants. In particular, we found that a greater dose of 
breast milk (more days on which breast milk comprised >50% of intake) was associated 
with larger deep nuclear gray matter. The thalamus and basal ganglia are the major relay 
stations in the brain46 and are central to cortical connectivity and effective neural 
functioning. Reductions in thalamic and basal ganglia volumes have previously been 
associated with more impairments in functioning in preterm populations.47–49 We also noted 
that greater average daily breast milk intake was associated with larger hippocampus volume 
at term equivalent. The hippocampus is important for memory and learning50 and we have 
show previously in this cohort that larger hippocampal volume is associated with better 
working memory,51 with similar findings in another study of preterm adolescents.52 Possibly 
related to our current finding of larger hippocampal volume associated with breast milk, we 
also noted better working memory in association with greater breast milk intake. Overall, 
these findings regarding volume of the deep nuclear gray matter and hippocampus may offer 
clues regarding mechanisms by which breast milk feeding influences later 
neurodevelopmental outcomes.

 The strengths of our study include the high follow-up rate to 7 years, detailed measures of 
neurodevelopment, and brain MRIs performed at two time points. This study focused on 
regional volumetric outcome measures from structural MRI. Future analysis of data from 
our cohort in relation to breast milk intake could include diffusion measures that reflect 
white matter microstructural organization.16 We could not assess brain growth during the 
neonatal hospitalization (e.g. change in size from birth to term), which would be of interest 
given concerns that even fortified breast milk may not provide adequate nutrition for very 
preterm infants.9, 10, 42 We focused on breast milk intake in the first 28 days of life, with the 
advantage that there was very little attrition due to early transfer or discharge that could bias 
results. In a subset of our participants, intake during the first 28 days was highly correlated 
with intake later in the hospitalization; it is likely that continued breast milk intake beyond 
28 days contributed to outcomes. A limitation is that we did not collect information about 
breast milk intake or breastfeeding after neonatal discharge. Additionally, like any 
observational study, ours is subject to residual confounding. It is notable that many of our 
estimates were unaffected by adjustment for social and other risks, however we lacked data 
on maternal IQ or parenting style and therefore could not adjust for these potential 
confounders.
We found that greater breast milk feeding in the first 28 days of life was associated with 
larger deep nuclear gray matter and hippocampal volume at term equivalent age, and with 
higher IQ, academic achievement, working memory, and motor scores at 7 years of age in 
very preterm infants. These results provide support for national53 and international54 
recommendations to provide breast milk as the primary diet for preterm infants.
