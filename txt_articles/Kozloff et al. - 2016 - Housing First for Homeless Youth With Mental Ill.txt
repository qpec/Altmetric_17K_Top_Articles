abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: "Housing First" has been shown to improve housing stability in 
homeless individuals with mental illness, but had not been empirically tested in homeless 
youth. We aimed to evaluate the effect of "Housing First" on housing stability in homeless 
youth aged 18 to 24 years participating in At Home/Chez Soi, a 24-month randomized trial 
of "Housing First" in 5 Canadian cities.
METHODS: Homeless individuals with mental illness were randomized to receive "Housing 
First" (combined with assertive community treatment or intensive case management 
depending on their level of need) or treatment as usual. We defined our primary outcome, 
housing stability, as the percent of days stably housed as a proportion of days for which 
residence data were available.
RESULTS: Of 2148 participants who completed baseline interviews and were randomized, 
7% (n = 156) were youth aged 18 to 24 years; 87 received "Housing First" and 69 received 
treatment as usual. In an adjusted analysis, youth in "Housing First" were stably housed 
a mean of 437 of 645 (65%) days for which data were available compared with youth in 
treatment as usual, who were stably housed a mean of 189 of 582 (31%) days for which data 
were available, resulting in an adjusted mean difference of 34% (95% confidence interval, 
24%–45%; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: "Housing First" was associated with improved housing stability in homeless 
youth with mental illness. Future research should explore whether adaptations of the 
model for youth yield additional improvements in housing stability and other outcomes.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Despite the 
burden of homelessness on young people, there 
is little evidence for interventions targeting their 
housing. "Housing First, 
" a housing and psychosocial 
intervention with evidence in adults, is being used in 
youth without having been tested in this population.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This subgroup analysis 
of youth aged 18 to 24 years provides experimental 
evidence that "Housing First" in homeless youth with 
mental illness improves housing stability relative 
to usual care. Adaptations of the model may be 
required to improve other outcomes.

Ten percent of America’s homeless 
are unaccompanied youth aged 18 to 
24 years. 
1 Homeless youth have rates 
of mental disorders at least twice 
those of housed youth. 
2 On average, 
homeless youth with mental illness 
report having been homeless for 
over 2 years, a substantial portion 
of their young lives. 
3 The chronic 
stress and deprivation associated 
with homelessness may have lasting 
effects on cognitive and academic 
functioning, financial stability, and 
physical and mental health. 
2
Despite this, few interventions 
for homeless youth have been 
empirically tested, 
 
2, 
 
4 and even fewer 
have targeted housing outcomes. 
Case management, a strategy used 
widely with homeless youth, has 
demonstrated improvements in 
housing stability over time, but 
did not separate from other active 
treatments 
5 or treatment as usual. 
6 
The Community Reinforcement 
Approach, an operant-based behavior 
therapy tested in 2 randomized 
controlled trials in homeless youth, 
was associated with a reduction of 
days homeless5 and increased social 
stability (a measure which included 
housing), 
 
7 but with only the latter 
trial demonstrating improvement 
relative to a comparison group, it is 
not clear that any empirically tested 
interventions have impacted youth’s 
housing stability beyond general 
support and the passage of time.
"Housing First, 
" developed in New 
York in the 1990s by Pathways to 
Housing based on the principles 
of housing as a human right, harm 
reduction, consumer choice, and 
recovery, provides immediate access 
to permanent independent housing 
in the community. 
8 In homeless 
adults with mental illness, it has 
been consistently shown to increase 
housing stability, and some studies 
have also found improvements in 
other outcomes, including days 
in the hospital, quality of life, 
and substance use. 
9 In 2008, the 
Canadian government invested $110 
million through the Mental Health 
Commission of Canada for At Home/
Chez Soi, the largest trial of "Housing 
First" to date. At Home/Chez Soi 
found that "Housing First" improved 
housing stability in homeless people 
with mental illness 
10, 
 
11; participants 
who received more intensive 
psychosocial support also had 
improvements in quality of life and 
community functioning compared 
with usual care.11 Paralleling its 
dissemination in homeless adults, 
"Housing First" is increasingly being 
applied to homeless youth; the US 
Department of Housing and Urban 
Development presents models based 
on "Housing First" principles as 
best practice for homeless youth. 
12 
However, "Housing First" has never 
been experimentally tested in youth, 
including as a subgroup in previous 
trials. Given the importance of 
establishing evidence to improve 
housing in youth, we conducted a 
subgroup analysis of youth aged 18 
to 24 years in At Home/Chez Soi. 
Our objectives were to examine the 
impact of "Housing First" on housing 
stability in homeless youth, to 
compare this with the effect in adults, 
and, guided by findings in adults, 
 
9 to 
explore the effect of "Housing First" 
on other domains, including quality 
of life, community functioning, 
psychological distress, problem 
substance use, health services use, 
and arrests in homeless youth.
METHODS
Study Design
At Home/Chez Soi was a randomized 
controlled trial of "Housing First" 
across 5 cities in Canada: Vancouver, 
Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal, and 
Moncton. The study protocol has 
been detailed elsewhere. 
13 Study 
recruitment occurred from October 
2009 through June 2011. Research 
ethics boards in each jurisdiction 
approved the study (11 in total).
Participants were stratified into 
high- or moderate-needs groups 
according to their clinical and service 
use characteristics; high-needs 
participants were assigned to receive 
assertive community treatment 
(ACT) or treatment as usual and 
moderate-needs participants were 
assigned to receive intensive case 
management (ICM) (with some 
participants also receiving a locally 
developed psychosocial intervention) 
or treatment as usual (Supplemental 
Table 3). This subgroup analysis 
combined active treatment groups 
to compare participants assigned 
to "Housing First" plus ACT or ICM 
with those who received treatment 
as usual. The 2-year outcomes 
associated with "Housing First" plus 
ACT and "Housing First" plus ICM in 
the full sample have been reported 
separately.

Participants
Participants were currently homeless 
or precariously housed individuals 
≥18 years in Moncton, Montreal, 
Toronto, and Winnipeg and ≥19 
years in Vancouver with a mental 
disorder. Homeless was defined as 
no fixed place to stay for ≥7 nights 
and little likelihood of obtaining 
permanent housing in the coming 
month, and precariously housed 
was defined as living in a rooming 
house, single-room occupancy or 
hotel/motel with ≥2 episodes of 
homelessness in the past year. 
Diagnosis of a mental disorder was 
based on Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth 
Edition criteria determined by the 
Mini International Neuropsychiatric 
Interview administered by 
researchers under supervision of 
a clinical psychologist, or written 
diagnosis (current psychiatric 
discharge summary or consultation 
report) at study entry. 
14 Individuals 
were excluded if they were already 
clients of ACT or ICM teams, had 
illegal immigration status, or did 
not meet specified criteria for 
homelessness. Participants were 
recruited from community agencies

that serve homeless people, 
institutions, including health care 
facilities and prisons and jails, and 
directly from the street. Recruitment 
was targeted at 100 participants per 
treatment arm per site.
Study Procedures
Potential participants provided 
verbal consent for eligibility 
screening, and then those who met 
inclusion criteria were assessed 
for capacity to consent before 
providing written informed consent. 
Participants were randomized to 
the active treatment or usual care 
by computer by using adaptive 
randomization procedures in a 1:1 
allocation ratio. The nature of the 
project did not allow for blinding of 
participants or interviewers.
Participants assigned to "Housing 
First" were given access to scattered-
site housing of their choice with 
mobile, off-site mental health 
services. 
8 They were required to 
have weekly contact with a mental 
health worker, but were not 
mandated to achieve or maintain 
sobriety or accept psychiatric 
treatment. Participants assigned 
to usual care had access to housing 
and support services through other 
programs in their communities 
postrandomization, including other 
ACT or ICM programs. None of the 
study cities offered the Pathways 
"Housing First" model before this 
study.
Participants completed 
comprehensive in-person interviews 
at baseline and every 6 months 
and brief measures of housing and 
vocational status by telephone or 
in person approximately every 3 
months with procedures in place to 
maximize participant retention and 
data quality. 
13 Most participants 
were followed for 24 months, 
although those enrolled toward the 
end of the trial were only followed for 
21 months. If interviewers indicated 
“no confidence” in participant 
responses, these were treated as 
missing (accounting for <2% of 
youth responses). Data were entered 
remotely on laptops and stored 
in a central database. Participants 
received cash incentives for attending 
interviews ranging from $30 to $50 
depending on the site and interview 
duration. This trial is registered 
with the International Standard 
Randomized Control Trial Register 
(identifier ISRCTN42520374).
Outcomes
The predefined primary outcome for 
the trial and this subgroup analysis 
was housing stability, measured 
with the highly reliable and valid 
Residential Time-Line Follow-Back 
Inventory, defined as days stably 
housed as a proportion of the 
number of days for which any type 
of residence data were available 
over the preceding 6 months. 
15 The 
main trial’s secondary outcome was 
generic quality of life, measured 
using EuroQoL 5 Dimensions, a 
standardized health utility and visual 
analog scale, which is used widely in 
clinical and economic evaluations. 
16
As exploratory outcomes, we 
examined condition-specific quality 
of life with the Lehman Quality of Life 
Interview 20 (QOLI-20) index, 
 
17 
community functioning with 
the observer-rated Multnomah 
Community Ability Scale, 
 
18 
community integration with the 
psychological integration subscale of 
the Community Integration Scale, 
 
19 
recovery with the Recovery 
Assessment Scale, 
 
20 self-rated 
physical health and mental health 
symptoms with the physical 
component summary and mental 
component summary scores of the 
Short Form 12 survey, 
21 past-month 
mental health symptoms with the 
Colorado Symptom Index, 
 
22 and past-
month substance-related problems 
with the Global Assessment of 
Individual Needs Short Screener—
Substance Problem Scale. 
23 The 
Health, Social and Justice Service Use 
Inventory, developed for the study 
based on existing measures, assessed 
health and criminal justice service 
involvement over the past 6 months: 
number of emergency department 
visits, having a regular medical 
doctor, perceived unmet health care 
needs, and number of arrests. Service 
provider visits were self-reported in 
the past month. Victimization was 
assessed by using questions from 
Statistics Canada’s General Social 
Survey, capturing participants who 
reported having been robbed by 
force, hit or attacked, or attempted 
forced or forced sexual activity in the 
last 6 months. 
24 Employment was 
measured by using the Vocational 
Time-Line Follow-Back Inventory. 
25
All outcomes were assessed at 
baseline. Housing and employment 
were assessed every 3 months. The 
remaining outcomes were assessed 
every 6 months, with the exception 
of the Short Form-12 (baseline, 
12 months, and 24 months), and 
Recovery Assessment Scale (baseline 
and 24 months).
Statistical Methods
Power was not determined a priori 
for this subgroup analysis of youth, 
but we calculated that a minimum 
of 63 participants per group would 
provide 80% power to detect an 
effect size of 0.5 for our outcomes, 
assuming homogeneity across sites 
and no attrition. We defined youth 
as ≤24 years old, reflective of the 
definitions used by the United 
Nations (which defines youth as 
15–24 years) and local governments 
(most of which define homeless 
youth as 16–24 years), although we 
were limited by the original study 
design to include only people ≥18 
years old.
We analyzed the effect of the 
intervention in youth on the percent 
of days stably housed over each 
6-month time point by fitting an 
analysis of covariance model that 
included treatment assignment, study 
city, indicators of ethnoracial and 
Aboriginal status, and a treatment ×

site interaction. We used a repeated 
measures mixed-effects model to 
determine the mean difference in 
housing stability in the "Housing 
First" and treatment as usual groups 
between youth ≤24 years and older 
participants over time by fitting 
a model with a 3-way interaction 
(treatment × age group × time). 
Minimal data on housing stability 
were missing in the full sample (in 
the range of 4%). 
10, 
 
11
For analysis of quality of life and 
exploratory outcomes, we applied 
a linear mixed models framework 
to perform repeated measures 
analysis of longitudinal continuous 
outcomes. We applied generalized 
estimating equations to repeated 
counts assuming the negative 
binomial distribution when outcomes 
were overdispersed. We calculated 
model-estimated differences in 
mean changes from baseline for 
continuous outcomes and ratio of 
rate ratios for counts and ratio of 
odds ratios for binary outcomes at 
the 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-month time 
points with 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs). We assessed employment 
over the 24-month study period. 
We tested the main fixed effects of 
treatment group, time, study city, and 
Aboriginal or ethnoracial status, as 
well as the overall treatment × time 
interaction. Because outcomes in our 
subgroup analysis were exploratory 
in nature, significance level was 
maintained at α = .05 and not 
adjusted for multiple testing. 
We conducted our analyses by using 
SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc, 
Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Of 2148 participants who were 
included in these analyses, 7% (n = 
156) were youth: 87 randomized 
to "Housing First" (either ACT or

ICM) and 69 to treatment as usual 
(see  
Fig 1). Baseline characteristics 
are displayed in  
Table 1. Although 
participants had not been explicitly 
randomized according to age, the 
youth treatment and control groups 
were balanced in their distribution of 
covariates.
In an analysis adjusting for study 
city and ethnoracial and Aboriginal 
status, youth in "Housing First" 
were stably housed a mean of 437 
of 645 (65%) days for which data 
were available compared with youth 
in treatment as usual, who were 
stably housed a mean of 189 of 582 
(31%) days for which data were 
available, resulting in an adjusted 
mean difference of 34% (95% CI, 
24%–45%; P < .001).
 
Figure 2 presents a comparison 
of youth aged 18 to 24 years and 
adults aged >24 years on mean 
percentage of days stably housed. 
The overall effect of the 3-way 
interaction of treatment group, 
age (18–24 years vs >24 years), 
and time on housing stability 
was nonsignificant (P = .59). For 
example, the difference in mean 
change in housing stability 
from 3 months to 24 months for 
18- to 24-year-olds compared with 
>24-year-olds was –4% (95% CI, 
–19% to 12%; P = .62).
 
Table 2 presents the trial’s 
secondary outcome (generic quality 
of life) and exploratory outcomes in 
youth ≤24 years old. "Housing First" 
was associated with significant 
improvements in leisure, a category 
of the QOLI-20, at 6, 12, and 
24 months, and an improvement in 
the total condition-specific quality 
of life score at 6 months relative 
to usual care. However, these 
improvements in leisure and the 
total QOLI-20 score did not result 
in significant differences from 
treatment as usual in the overall 
treatment group × time analysis 
(P = .10 and P = .17, respectively). 
"Housing First" was associated with 
lower rates of employment over the 
24-month study; 27 (32%) youths 
who received "Housing First" had 
at least 1 period of employment 
compared with 28 (44%) youths 
who received usual care, resulting in 
an adjusted odds ratio of 0.48 (95% 
CI, 0.24–0.99; P = .05). We did not 
find significant differences between 
"Housing First" and treatment 
as usual for other exploratory 
outcomes.
DISCUSSION
In the first experimental study of 
"Housing First" for homeless youth 
with mental illness, "Housing First" 
significantly improved housing 
stability. This effect was not 
significantly different from the effect 
in older adults and was consistent 
with findings from previous studies 
of "Housing First" in adults, 
 
9 as well 
as a case study that demonstrated 
high rates of housing retention 
in youth who received "Housing 
First". 
26
"Housing First" plus ICM or ACT did 
not appear to have a statistically 
significant effect on other outcomes 
in our youth sample. This is 
consistent with findings from the 
larger At Home/Chez Soi trial, 
 
10 
in which "Housing First" plus ICM 
improved housing stability in 
moderate-needs participants, but 
for other outcomes did not separate 
from usual care. "Housing First" plus 
ACT also improved housing stability 
and resulted in small but statistically

relative to treatment as usual, but 
there were no other differences. 
11
There are several potential 
explanations for our findings that 
"Housing First" only improved 
housing stability in homeless youth 
with mental illness. First, the sample 
size of youth aged 18 to 24 years 
was not determined a priori, and the 
study may have been underpowered 
to detect between-group differences. 
Second, combining ACT and ICM 
recipients may have obscured 
differences in outcomes by level of 
need. As noted above, analyses of 
the larger sample suggested that 
high-needs participants receiving 
the more intensive ACT intervention 
showed improvements in additional 
domains, but our sample size did 
not allow us to examine outcomes 
by intervention type. 
11 Third, 
participants in both the intervention 
and control groups may have 
exhibited regression to the mean 
on these outcomes. Those receiving 
usual care had access to other 
psychosocial services, which, perhaps 
for youth especially, may be fairly 
comprehensive, thus decreasing 
between-group differences. We found 
that "Housing First" and usual care 
recipients did not significantly differ 
in their service contacts. Fourth, our 
follow-up period may have been 
long enough to capture differences 
in housing outcomes, but not some 
of the secondary benefits that may 
occur as a result of stable housing. 
Based on earlier work, we know 
that our youngest participants had 
been homeless for years, with high 
rates of childhood trauma, chronic 
conditions like traumatic brain 
injury, and ongoing victimization, 
and therefore may take time after 
their housing is stabilized to recover 
in other areas and shift their use 
of acute medical services. 
3 Lastly, 
although ICM and ACT teams were 
regularly evaluated for model fidelity, 
the psychosocial interventions 
delivered may have varied across 
sites or service providers, or may not 
have been as well-suited to youth. 
Although the current "Housing First" 
plus ACT or ICM model improved 
housing stability in homeless youth, 
adaptations may be needed to 
target other outcomes. A detailed 
comparison of youth and adults in 
this sample suggested that youth 
were more likely to be an ethnoracial 
minority, have not completed high 
school, have a learning disorder or 
a drug use disorder, and to have 
been arrested recently, and were 
less likely to have a regular medical 
doctor, all of which may warrant 
tailored approaches to serving 
them. 
3
One exploratory outcome that 
did show some responsiveness to 
"Housing First" was satisfaction 
with leisure activities. This echoes 
the idea in Mullainathan and 
Shafir’s Scarcity that great stress 
diminishes the ability to engage in 
other tasks. 
27 Restoring housing 
stability might allow young people 
to enjoy leisure activities even if 
it does not result in a measurable 
impact on other areas of functioning. 
Youth who received "Housing 
First" were less likely to have 
worked than those who received 
usual care. This is consistent with 
findings from the larger At Home/
Chez Soi trial, which showed that 
"Housing First" recipients had 
lower odds of obtaining competitive 
employment compared with 
those who received treatment as 
usual. 
28 The authors hypothesized 
that receiving rent subsidies and 
government benefits may have 
reduced the financial burden of 
unemployment and decreased the 
incentive to work, particularly 
in provinces with lower earning 
exemptions for people receiving 
benefits (where participants had 
even lower odds of obtaining 
employment). We only examined 
a crude measure of employment 
in youth, but not the suitability or 
duration of employment. Additional 
research is needed to better 
understand pathways to meaningful

employment for homeless youth 
with mental illness.
The parent study has many strengths, 
including its randomized controlled 
design, extensive outcome measures, 
and delivery in a range of local 
contexts. However, we acknowledge 
some limitations in our work. First, 
this is a subgroup analysis of a 
larger study on "Housing First"; 
the intervention was not adapted 
to youth, nor were the instruments 
specifically selected with youth in 
mind. We were limited by study 
inclusion criteria to examining 
homeless youth aged 18 years and 
older. Although including youth aged 
16 to 17 years would have more 
accurately reflected existing services 
for homeless youth, differences in 
legal status for tenancy and, in some 
jurisdictions, informed consent make 
"Housing First" more complicated 
to study and implement in youth 
<18 years. These findings may not 
be generalizable to young people

<18 years. We conservatively used 
24 years of age as the upper limit 
for “youth, 
” and the resulting 
smaller sample may have been 
underpowered to detect differences 
in the intervention and control 
groups. Because of the nature of the 
study, participants and researchers 
were not blinded to treatment 
allocation. Because outcomes 
were exploratory in nature, 
we did not correct for multiple 
comparisons. Although sites were 
assessed for model fidelity, we 
could not control for all possible 
differences in services (eg, access to 
psychosocial interventions). Most 
of the outcomes analyzed in this 
study were based on self-report, 
including health services use and 
arrests, which may benefit from 
corroboration with administrative 
data.
CONCLUSIONS
This study has significant 
implications as the first to present 
experimental data examining 
"Housing First" for homeless youth 
with mental illness. It suggests 
that "Housing First" is a viable 
intervention to promote housing 
stability in homeless youth with 
mental illness and is as effective 
for young people as it is for adults 
in general. This real-world trial 
is expected to be reproducible 
given fidelity to a well-described 
model that has been replicated 
internationally. 
8 However, given 
that other outcomes did not appear 
to respond to the intervention, we 
suggest considering modifications of 
"Housing First" to maintain fidelity 
to core principles while better 
meeting the needs of youth. This 
may include attention to 
issues such as peer/family 
relationships, sexual health, 
education and job skills, culture, 
life skills, substance use, and crime 
avoidance, and should engage youth 
in all stages of implementation and 
evaluation. The results presented 
here are an important step to 
developing effective interventions 
to decrease the long-term 
consequences of homelessness in 
youth.
