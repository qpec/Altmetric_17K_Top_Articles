IMPORTANCE Ocular trauma can lead to lifelong sequelae, and sports-related ocular injuries
have been shown to disproportionately affect the young. Studies quantifying and
characterizing the incidence and type of injuries seen with sports-related ocular trauma may
be useful for resource utilization, training, and prevention efforts.
OBJECTIVE To examine the emergency department (ED) burden of sports-related ocular
trauma in the United States.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective, cross-sectional study examined the
Nationwide Emergency Department Sample, containing data from approximately 30 million
ED visits annually at more than 900 hospitals nationwide, from January 1, 2010, to December
31, 2013, to determine factors associated with sports-related ocular trauma.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Annual incidence of sports-related ocular trauma, broken
down by age, sex, mechanism of injury, and related activity, as well as factors associated with
short-term impaired vision.
RESULTS During the study period, 120 847 individuals (mean age, 22.3 years [95% CI,
21.9-22.7]; 96 872 males, 23 963 females, and 12 with missing data) presented with
sports-related ocular trauma, which was the primary diagnosis in 85 961 patients. Injuries
occurred most commonly among males (69 849 [81.3%]; 95% CI, 80.6%-81.9%) and
occurred most frequently as a result of playing basketball (22.6%; 95% CI, 21.7%-23.6%),
playing baseball or softball (14.3%; 95% CI, 13.7%-14.9%), and shooting an air gun (11.8%;
95% CI, 10.8%-12.8%). Odds of presentation to the ED with impaired vision were greatest for
paintball and air gun injuries relative to football-related injuries (odds ratio, 4.75; 95% CI,
2.21-10.19 and 3.71; 95% CI, 2.34-5.88, respectively; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In our study, approximately 30 000 individuals presented
annually to EDs in the United States with sports-related eye injuries; in more than 70% of
these cases, eye injuries were the primary diagnosis. Activities involving projectiles pose the
greatest risk for visual impairment in the short term, although long-term outcomes were
unavailable.

O
cular injuries are a significant cause of morbidity and
disability in the US population.1,2 The Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention estimates that the an-
nual rate of presentation to the emergency department (ED)
for all-cause ocular injury is approximately 37.6 per 10 000
population.3 Eye injuries can have long-term sequelae that
affect quality of life for years and can predispose the indi-
vidual to further injury, depression, and systemic disease.4-15
Visual impairment also poses substantial economic chal-
lenges to patients, health systems, and payers, which may fur-
theraffectthepatient’
saccesstoqualitycareandfollow-up.16-18
Sports-related activities contribute to a substantial pro-
portion of injuries in the ED, particularly among young
people.19-22 Although many of these injuries are musculosk-
eletal in nature, sports-related injuries to the central nervous
system and eyes are not uncommon in EDs.21,23-30 Eye inju-
ries sustained in sports-related activities may differentially
affect young people, predisposing them to the possibility of
long-term sequelae and reduced quality of life.20,29,31-33
Previous efforts to estimate the national burden of
sports-related eye injuries have been hampered by inconsis-
tencies in how these injuries have been defined; for
example, narrow definitions of the word sport, possibly
influenced by regional and cultural differences, have exag-
gerated interstudy variability.5,34-37 Unclear definitions of
delineations between organized sporting activities and rec-
reational sporting activities contribute to this variability.
A 2013 article by Selassie et al38 expanded the accepted defi-
nition of sports-related injuries; using external cause of
injury codes from the International Classification of Diseases,
Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM), the authors
were able to include injuries sustained during recreational
activities, such as swimming, running, and off-road power
and equestrian sports. Modifications to the ICD-9-CM imple-
mented in 2009 further expanded researchers’ability to
characterize sports-related injury by differentiating between
specific team sports (eg, football, baseball, or basketball).39
In light of these developments, we sought to estimate and
characterize the burden of sports-related ocular trauma in EDs
in the United States from 2010 to 2013.
Methods
The Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS),
part of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, is the
nation’
s largest all-payer ED database; as such, it includes
data on all patients, regardless of insurance status. When
weighted to the level of the US population, the NEDS con-
tains administrative discharge data on approximately 30 mil-
lion ED visits annually from more than 900 hospitals
nationwide.40 The NEDS and other Healthcare Cost and
Utilization Project data sets are often used by the National
Center for Injury Prevention and Control for the purpose of
epidemiologic statistics and surveillance, and compare
favorably with other well-established national samples, such
as the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey
and the National Hospital Discharge Survey.41,42
Ocular trauma was defined as a diagnosis of either blow-
out fracture of the orbit, open wounds of the ocular adnexa
or eye, superficial injury or contusion to the eye or adnexa, for-
eign body on the external eye, burn confined to the eye and
adnexa, or injury to the optic nerve and pathways or cranial
nerves III, IV, or VI (ICD-9-CM codes 802.6, 802.7, 870.x, 871.x,
918.x,921.x,930.x,940.x,950.x,951.0,951.1,and951.3).These
cases were further identified as either a primary or nonpri-
mary diagnosis of sports-related ocular trauma. Although the
acute and long-term effects of ocular injuries can be just as se-
vere or worse for patients for whom the eye-related injury is
nottheprimarydiagnosis,includingthoseassociatedwithmo-
tor vehicle crashes, traumatic brain injury, and other polytrau-
matic injuries, we focused much of our analysis on patients
with primary diagnoses of ocular injury to more clearly elu-
cidate which activities contribute most specifically to eye in-
jury. Patients with sports-related ED presentation were iden-
tified using a list of ICD-9-CM external cause of injury codes
compiled from examination of the literature and ICD-9-CM
codes available for the dates of interest (eTable in the Supple-
ment). This study was approved by the Johns Hopkins Medi-
cal Institutions institutional review board. The NEDS is an ad-
ministrativelimiteddatasetandindividualpatientconsentwas
not required.
We queried the NEDS database using the above criteria to
identify all patients presenting to EDs in the United States be-
tween January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2013; before 2010,
details on injuries sustained while playing specific team sports
(eg, football, baseball, basketball) were either unavailable or
not widely used, which limited their utility for the purposes
of this study. Data examined included visit-level data, such as
information related to the injury, diagnosis, ED-specific
charges, geographic region, and expected primary insurer, as
well as patient-level data, such as age, sex, and zip code–
based estimated income quartile. χ2 Testing was performed on
thesecategoricalvariablestomeasureassociation,withP ≤ . 05
considered significant. Population-specific rates were calcu-
lated using data from the US Census Bureau.
Key Points
Question What activities led to the highest number of
sports-related eye injuries between 2010 and 2013 in the United
States?
Findings In a cross-sectional analysis of a nationally
representative emergency department database, 120 847
individuals presented to emergency departments nationwide
between 2010 and 2013 with a diagnosis of sports-related ocular
injury, which was the primary diagnosis in 85 961 patients.
Basketball, baseball, and air guns were the most common causes
of injury, accounting for almost half of all primary sports-related
eye injuries.
Meaning These findings may help set priorities and develop
strategies to try to reduce sports-related eye injuries among
individuals presenting to emergency departments in the United
States each year.

The NEDS does not contain data on visual acuity, and al-
though diagnoses of visual abnormalities may represent pre-
existing conditions, the likelihood that participants in sports
would have such a preexisting diagnosis is low. Multivariable
logistic regression modeling was used to explore the effect of
patient- and injury-level factors on the odds of impaired vi-
sion, which included visual disturbances (ICD-9-CM code
368.x) and blindness and low vision (ICD-9-CM code 369.x);
as with others, these diagnoses are only present in the medi-
cal record if they were made at the time of the ED visit, so lack
of a vision-related code may reflect either unimpaired vision
or that assessment of vision was not performed. As this model
was explanatory in nature, stepwise variable selection for par-
simony was not used. Wald tests were used to assess the ef-
fect of individual variables on the model, and P ≤ .05 was con-
sidered significant.
Standard descriptive statistical methods were used to ana-
lyze associations between patient, injury, and hospital char-
acteristics and presentation to the ED with sports-related ocu-
lar injuries.
Results
During the 4-year study period, 120 847 patients presented
to the ED with sports-related ocular trauma; for 85 961 of
these individuals, ocular trauma was the primary diagnosis.
These 85 961 patients with primary sports-related ocular
trauma accounted for approximately 3.3% of all 2 636 037
patients with primary ocular trauma presenting to the ED
during the study period, and the 60 027 patients with iso-
lated sports-related ocular trauma represented 2.8% of all
2 156 962 patients with isolated ocular trauma (no other inju-
ries reported). Patients with primary sports-related ocular
trauma were most commonly male (69 849 [81.3%]; 95% CI,
80.6%-81.9%). Mean patient ages were 20.1 years (95% CI,
19.7-20.5) and 19 years (95% CI, 18.4-19.7) for males and
females, respectively (P < .001). Age-specific rates of injury
increased for every successive year from age 7 until age 15
years (among females) or age 17 years (among males), after
which they were markedly reduced (Figure 1). More than
half of the males (41 775 [59.8%]) and females (10 814
[67.1%]) who sustained sports-related primary ocular inju-
ries were 18 years or younger.
Basketball was the leading cause of injury among male pa-
tients (25.7%; 95% CI, 24.7%-26.7%), followed by baseball or
softball (13.2%; 95% CI, 12.5%-13.8%) and shooting an air gun
(12.7%; 95% CI, 11.7%-13.8%) (Table 1). Baseball or softball was
the most common cause of injury among female patients
(19.2%;95%CI,17.8%-20.7%),followedbycycling(10.8%;95%
CI, 9.7%-12.1%) and soccer (10.3%; 95% CI, 9.2%-11.5%). Al-
though cycling accounted for the second-highest total num-
ber of eye injuries (n = 21 227), less than half of these injuries
(8319 [39.2%]) included a primary diagnosis of ocular trauma;
the same was true for ocular injuries associated with eques-
trian sports (310 [46.4%]) and off-road power sports (1873
[35.4%]). The sport-specific proportion of ocular injuries iden-
tified as primary vs secondary varied by sport, with soccer

portions of patients presenting with sport-specific ocular in-

Overall, open wounds of the adnexa (ICD-9-CM code
870.x) were the most common type of injury (33.5%; 95% CI,
32.4%-34.5%), followed by contusions of the eye and adnexa
(ICD-9-CM code 921.x; 30.1%; 95% CI, 29.1%-31.1%) and
superficial injuries of the eye and adnexa (ICD-9-CM code
918.x; 21.1%; 95% CI, 20.4%-21.8%) (Table 1). Among
basketball-related injuries, open wounds of the adnexa were
most common (9062 [46.6%]; 95% CI, 44.7%-48.4%), fol-
lowed by superficial wounds (5672 [29.1%]; 95% CI, 27.6%-
30.7%); for baseball-related incidents, contusions (6331
[51.5%]; 95% CI, 49.4%-53.7%) were most common, fol-
lowed by orbital fractures (2568 [20.9%]; 95% CI, 19.2%-
22.7%). Injuries sustained from shooting an air gun were
most commonly contusions (4818 [47.7%]; 95% CI, 44.9%-
50.5%), followed by superficial wounds of the eye and
adnexa (2946 [29.2%]; 95% CI, 26.9%-31.5%).
Although only 3760 (3.1%) of all individuals who pre-
sented to the ED with a diagnosis of ocular trauma had
impaired vision, rates of visual symptoms varied widely by
sports-related activity, injury type, and age. The proportion
of injuries resulting in impaired vision was highest for those
injuries associated with paintball (10.2%), shooting an air

gun (8.2%), racket sports (5.8%), and soccer (5.7%) (Table 2).
After adjustment for other variables, the odds of impaired
vision for sports-related ocular trauma were 4.75 times
higher for a paintball-related injury (95% CI, 2.21-10.19) and
3.71 times higher for an air gun–related injury (95% CI, 2.34-
5.88) than for football-related ocular injuries (P < .001)
(Table 3). Adjusted odds of visual impairment generally
increased by age, and did not vary by sex, income quartile,
or season.
Discussion
Traumatic ocular events and their sequelae predispose pa-
tients to long-term physical, psychosocial, and economic ef-
fects, and sports-related events have been reported as a promi-
nentcontributortotheoverallburdenofoculartrauma.9,10,12,43
Sports-related ocular trauma has been identified as a substan-
tial risk factor for inpatient hospitalization, with some esti-
mates suggesting that 22% to 40% of hospitalizations for ocu-
lar trauma were the result of injuries sustained during
participation in sporting activities.25,26,44
We have found that these injuries represent a substan-
tial burden in EDs in the United States, accounting for
approximately 30 000 ED visits annually—an estimate sub-
stantially higher than previously reported.5 Presenting
patients tended to be young, and incidence peaked during
adolescent years for both male and female patients. This
differential burden on the young highlights the potential for
long-term loss of quality-adjusted life years.
Patients presenting with injuries resulting from basket-
ball, cycling, and baseball or softball and air guns represented
the largest cohort of ED presentations for all primary and
nonprimary sports-related ocular injuries. Among only pa-
tients with primary ocular injuries, ED presentation was most
commonly owing to basketball, baseball or softball, and shoot-
inganairgun.Combined,these3activitiesaccountedfor48.7%
of all primary injuries in this population. Although most inju-
ries resulting from sports-related activities were superficial,
more than one-fifth of baseball-related injuries were blowout
fractures of the orbit.
Impaired vision was rare but showed a strong affiliation
with recreational projectile-firing devices. Paintball and air
guns accounted for 991 of all 3760 cases resulting in
impaired vision (26.4%), despite accounting for only 11 937
of all 120 847 injuries (9.9%). Soccer-related injuries also
contributed a disproportionate share of visual impairment
(408 of all 3760 vision impairments [10.9%] and 7162 of all
120 847 injuries [5.9%]). Cycling-related injuries were rela-
tively less likely to lead to visual impairment (377 of all 3760
visual impairments [9.7%] and 21 227 of all 120 847 injuries
[17.6%]).
Logistic regression modeling underscored the elevated
risk associated with projectile-firing recreational devices, as
injuries from shooting paintball and air guns showed 4.75
and 3.71 times greater adjusted odds, respectively, of lead-
ing to visual impairment than injuries sustained during par-
ticipation in football. Patients with injuries from soccer and
hockey also showed substantially elevated risk of vision
impairment after adjustment, compared with patients pre-
senting to the ED with isolated ocular injuries sustained
playing football (odds ratio, 2.42 and 2.32, respectively;
P < .001) (Table 3).
Limitations
Use of an administrative database such as the NEDS carries
several limitations.45 The number of individuals sustaining
sports-related ocular injuries who present to non-ED
sources, such as primary care physicians, outpatient oph-
thalmologists, and urgent care facilities, or who choose not
to seek care, is unknown, and such individuals will not be
included in ED-specific data sets such as the NEDS; our
study is limited to those presenting to the ED for care. Simi-
larly, data after discharge from the ED, such as surgical inter-
vention and length of hospitalization, are unavailable in this
data set, as are data on long-term visual outcomes or
detailed assessments of visual acuity, all of which would
likely be of interest to both health care professionals and
policy makers. The NEDS contains administrative discharge
data as provided by participating hospitals to the Healthcare
Cost and Utilization Project via state agencies; while coding
practices at individual hospitals may vary to some extent, it
is anticipated that the treating health care professional
would generally be responsible for diagnoses.

Conclusions
These results suggest a path forward for efforts to prevent
sports-related ocular trauma. Research has repeatedly
shown that appropriate protective eyewear can reduce
the incidence of sports-related ocular trauma.37,46-51 Man-
dating the use of such protective gear has reduced rates
of injury across several sports, and recent research sug-
gests that when appropriate eyewear is available but not
mandatory, top-performing athletes frequently choose to
wear it.48

Although such approaches may be appropriate for orga-
nized team sports, they are not likely to affect the burden of
sports-related ocular trauma due to nonorganized recre-
ational sporting activities, including those most correlated
with visual impairment, such as shooting paintball and air
guns. Reducing sports-related ocular trauma among indi-
viduals engaging in these activities, along with individual
sports with high levels of injuries, such as cycling, will likely
require a coordinated approach from policy makers, indus-
try, and public health professionals. Further research is war-
ranted to identify opportunities for intervention among
sports participants.
