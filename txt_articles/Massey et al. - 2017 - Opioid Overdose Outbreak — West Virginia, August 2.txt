On August 15, 2016, the Mayor’s Office of Drug Control 
Policy in Huntington, West Virginia, notified the Cabell-
Huntington Health Department (CHHD) of multiple calls 
regarding opioid overdose received by the emergency medical 
system (EMS) during 3 p.m.–8 p.m. that day. A public health 
investigation and response conducted by the West Virginia 
Bureau for Public Health (BPH) and CHHD identified 
20 opioid overdose cases within a 53-hour period in Cabell 
County; all cases included emergency department (ED) 
encounters. EMS personnel, other first responders, and ED 
providers administered the opioid antidote naloxone to 16 
(80%) patients, six of whom were administered multiple doses, 
suggesting exposure to a highly potent opioid. No patients 
received referral for recovery support services. In addition to 
the public health investigation, a public safety investigation 
was conducted; comprehensive opioid toxicology testing of 
clinical specimens identified the synthetic opioid fentanyl* 
and novel fentanyl analogs, including carfentanil,† which had 
been used by patients who overdosed in Huntington. Results 
of these two investigations highlight the importance of col-
laboration between public health and public safety agencies 
to provide in-depth surveillance data from opioid overdose 
outbreaks that involve high-potency fentanyl analogs. These 
data facilitated a public health response through increased 
awareness of powerful opioid substances requiring multiple 
naloxone doses for reversal, and improved patient linkage to 
recovery support services and a harm reduction program from 
the ED after opioid overdose.
Public Health Investigation
On August 18, 2016, CHHD requested assistance from BPH 
to investigate the opioid overdose outbreak in Cabell County 
and conducted a retrospective public health investigation to 
characterize the outbreak and improve public health response. 
Investigators collected data from multiple stakeholders, 
including public safety (law enforcement and fire department 
personnel) and health care facilities and created case-finding 
methods and case definitions. To identify cases, investigators 
collected Cabell County EMS records and records from the 
two Cabell County EDs covering a 53-hour period from 3 p.m. 
* Fentanyl is a high-potency synthetic opioid that is up to 100 times more potent 
than morphine.
† Carfentanil is a fentanyl analog that is up to 100 times more potent than 
fentanyl; it is used to sedate large animals, such as elephants.
on August 14, 2016, to 8 p.m. on August 16, 2016, (24 hours 
before and 24 hours after the 5-hour period of increased drug 
overdose EMS calls on August 15). Investigators also collected 
West Virginia Poison Center records of prehospital naloxone 
administration by Cabell County public safety personnel. 
Investigators screened, identified, and selected records related 
to an opioid overdose using key terms and applied the case 
definition to records from the study period, using a case iden-
tification algorithm (Figure 1). Demographic information, 
rescue and resuscitation measures, medical history, clinical 
findings, and ED disposition were abstracted from all record 
sources and analyzed.
A probable case of opioid overdose was defined as 1) clinical 
suspicion of opioid exposure (documented by patient mention 
of drug use, observed drug paraphernalia, naloxone admin-
istration, or ED diagnosis of drug poisoning or drug use) 
and 2) one or more clinical signs of central nervous system 
depression (e.g., bradypnea, apnea, altered consciousness, or 
miosis) in a person identified through EMS or ED records, 
from 3 p.m. August 14 through 8 p.m. August 16. Confirmed 
opioid overdose cases met the probable case definition and had 
a positive toxicology screening§ result for any drug of abuse. 
A positive toxicology result for any drug of abuse was used to 
confirm cases because persons who abuse opioids might use 
multiple drugs, including nonopioids (1), and available clinical 
toxicology screening tests do not detect fentanyl or fentanyl 
analogs. Public health investigators did not have access to in-
state confirmatory testing for fentanyl and fentanyl analogs.¶
Twenty patients met the opioid overdose case definition; 
12 patients had probable cases and eight had confirmed cases. 
§ Clinical toxicology screening in emergency departments was limited to a 
qualitative urine immunoassay evaluation for amphetamines, barbiturates, 
benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, methadone, opiates (e.g., codeine, 
morphine, and heroin), and phencyclidine. It did not confirm the presence of 
high-potency synthetic opioids, including fentanyl or fentanyl analogs. The 
case definition (which included substances from and symptoms attributable to 
nonopioid sedative drug classes) was employed to increase case-finding 
sensitivity in an outbreak setting lacking a surveillance system; specificity might 
have been improved by using a narrower case definition.
¶ A concurrent public safety investigation of this overdose outbreak was conducted 
by public safety agencies (law enforcement and fire department personnel) 
separate from the public health investigation; public safety investigators released 
their findings to public health investigators in March 2017, after legal 
proceedings concluded. Public safety investigation findings included 
comprehensive confirmatory opioid toxicology testing results of urine and blood 
specimens from patients who were subjects in the public health investigation.

Patients aged 26–35 years accounted for 50% of cases. Location 
of first responder contact with 17 (85%) patients was within 
the city of Huntington; 14 (82%) of these contacts occurred 
during 3 p.m.–8 p.m. on August 15 (Figure 2). All patients had 
ED encounters during the study period; 18 (90%) arrived by 
EMS. The most commonly reported clinical signs were altered 
consciousness (13; 65%) and respiratory failure (11; 55%). 
Fourteen patients (70%) reported using heroin immediately 
before being evaluated in the ED. Sixteen (80%) patients 
received naloxone; among these patients, 12 received naloxone 
only in the prehospital setting, two received naloxone during 
both prehospital and ED encounters, and two received naloxone 
only in the ED. Six patients received multiple naloxone doses. 
Among eight (40%) patients who had toxicology screenings, 
opioids were detected in six, and more than one substance was 
identified in five (Table). Twelve (60%) patients left the ED 
against medical advice before discharge. All 20 patients survived, 
although no referrals for recovery support services, including 
treatment of substance use disorder, opioid addiction, opioid 
withdrawal, or harm reduction services (e.g., naloxone prescrib-
ing or safe injection education) were documented.
Public Safety Investigation
Public safety officials conducted a separate investigation 
of this opioid overdose outbreak in conjunction with legal 
proceedings; this investigation included comprehensive opioid

* As a result of the public safety investigation, carfentanil and furanylfentanyl were identified in March 2017 among patients who had been evaluated on August 15, 
2016, during 3 p.m.–4 p.m. and 5 p.m.–6 p.m.
toxicology testing of clinical specimens obtained from the 
treating EDs. In October 2016, the BPH Office of the Chief 
Medical Examiner (OCME) and the Drug Enforcement 
Administration confirmed the first carfentanil-related death in 
Cabell County, which occurred within days of the August 15, 
2016 outbreak (2). Results of the comprehensive opioid testing 
were released to CHHD on March 23, 2017, and four patients’ 
specimens from the public safety investigation were matched 
to specimens from the public health investigation cases, three 
of which were positive for carfentanil and furanylfentanyl. The 
fourth specimen was positive for fentanyl only, with insuffi-
cient specimen volume for fentanyl analog testing (Table). On 
April 17, 2017, the U.S. Attorney’s Office released a statement 
that an Akron, Ohio, resident had been convicted of heroin, 
fentanyl, and carfentanil distribution in Huntington, West 
Virginia, on the afternoon of August 15, 2016 (3). OCME 
reported that fentanyl was involved in a number of opioid 
overdose deaths in Cabell County during several weeks preced-
ing the mid-August opioid overdose outbreak.** 
 
** Mortality and drug testing data from Cabell County during the study period 
was not immediately available to public health investigators because of legal 
constraints. These data were reported to public health investigators separately 
in March 2017. Exact numbers were suppressed to preserve confidentiality 
in a small community.

Public Health Response
In October 2016, BPH released a health advisory to medi-
cal providers, first responders, and public safety personnel, 
notifying them of carfentanil emergence in the illicit opioid 
supply in West Virginia, the danger of carfentanil exposure, 
and the role of multiple-dose naloxone administration after 
exposure (2). Fentanyl testing of decedent specimens became 
available in-state through OCME in October 2016. Public 
health stakeholders increased naloxone distribution among first 
responders to meet the potential need for multiple-dose resus-
citation. After receiving public health investigation findings 
that no opioid overdose patients who met the case definition 
had been referred for substance use disorder treatment, CHHD 
and local ED staff members improved referral protocols for 
overdose care and recovery support services. Local EDs coordi-
nated with substance use–disorder treatment facilities to pilot 
multidisciplinary response teams that follow up with patients 
who experience opioid overdose and ensure linkage to care 
availability after ED encounters (e.g., direct connection to 
CHHD harm reduction program staff members).
Discussion
This report describes a nonfatal outbreak of opioid overdoses 
in Cabell County, West Virginia, that heralded the emergence 
of two powerful fentanyl analogs, carfentanil and furanylfen-
tanyl, in the local illicit drug supply. Public health investigation 
revealed a narrow clustering of the majority of cases in place 
and time, along with requirement for multiple-dose naloxone 
for resuscitation, suggesting that a point-source opioid over-
dose outbreak involving a high-potency opioid had occurred. 
However, fentanyl analog screening was unavailable in EDs 
at the time, and therefore, comprehensive toxicology was not 
accessible to public health investigators. Comprehensive opioid 
testing is often a component of public safety investigations, and 
a concurrent public safety investigation subsequently identified 
fentanyl analogs used by three patients. Medical examiner data

US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
obtained during the outbreak period demonstrated the emer-
gence of carfentanil among opioid overdose decedents in Cabell 
County during this period, providing further evidence of the 
debut of carfentanil among heroin users in Cabell County and 
its role as a cause of this outbreak. Epidemiologic evidence and 
public safety investigation findings were consistent with the 
U.S. Attorney’s Office report (3).
Opioid overdose outbreak preparedness requires the coop-
eration of public health and public safety officials to effec-
tively investigate and characterize the scope and nature of an 
outbreak. Although polysubstance use was identified by ED 
toxicology screening in five of the eight confirmed cases, most 
patients who experienced overdose reported using heroin only, 
and none reported using a synthetic opioid. Therefore, com-
prehensive toxicology testing for fentanyl, fentanyl analogs, 
and other newly emerging psychoactive substances might 
be important when conducting overdose outbreak investiga-
tions. Development and implementation of opioid overdose 
surveillance standards, comprehensive testing capabilities, and 
overdose outbreak investigation tools are needed to improve 
rapid identification of local illicit opioid supply changes and 
facilitate targeted and coordinated public health and public 
safety response and prevention measures. In New Haven, 
Connecticut, a fentanyl-related overdose investigation dem-
onstrated that collaboration between public health, health care 
facilities, and public safety departments improves resuscitation 
preparedness efforts after an opioid overdose outbreak (4). 
However, continuum of care for patients involved in an opioid 
overdose outbreak should not stop at the point of resuscita-
tion. Initiating treatment for opioid use disorder in the ED has 
been shown to significantly increase patient engagement†† in 
addiction treatment (5). ED encounters during this outbreak 
represent missed opportunities to link persons with a nonfatal 
overdose to substance use–disorder treatment initiation and 
ongoing care.
Surveillance for clusters of opioid overdose at the local level is 
increasingly important because of the rapidly changing nature 
of the opioid epidemic in recent years as communities witness 
emergence of synthetic opioids among fatal and nonfatal cases 
of opioid overdose (4,6). Comprehensive testing for synthetic 
opioids is not routinely included in ED toxicology screenings, 
although it is often available to public safety investigators (6,7). 
Cooperation between public health and public safety officials 
during overdose outbreak investigations could facilitate timely 
messaging to inform medical providers and public health and 
public safety personnel regarding emerging drug threats.
 
†† Patient engagement was defined as program enrollment and receipt of formal 
addiction treatment.
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Opioid overdose is a growing health threat in the United States; 
CDC issued a health advisory to health departments, health care 
providers, first responders, and medical examiners about the 
introduction of high-potency synthetic opioids into the illicit 
opioid supply, causing outbreaks of opioid overdose and 
overdose-related deaths. Patient administration of the opioid 
antidote naloxone during an opioid overdose outbreak can save 
lives; however, little is known about follow-up care after resuscita-
tion of patients who experience overdose during an outbreak.
What is added by this report?
An investigation of a nonfatal opioid overdose outbreak that 
occurred in Huntington, West Virginia, on August 15, 2016, 
identified 20 cases during a 53-hour period (14 overdoses 
occurred within 5 hours) and provided evidence that a novel, 
high-potency synthetic opioid was introduced into a commu-
nity of persons who use illicit opioids. None of the opioid 
overdose patients who met case criteria received referral for 
substance use disorder treatment or harm reduction services.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Local surveillance of opioid overdose that includes investiga-
tion of overdose outbreaks produces data that can direct 
public health response to the opioid overdose epidemic. 
Development of public health and public safety partnerships 
for substance identification, and of strategies to link overdose 
patients to recovery support services at the point of resuscita-
tion, might reduce missed opportunities to engage persons 
who use illicit opioids.
