Purpose:
To demonstrate the feasibility of the use of a rapid, non-
invasive, in vivo imaging method to measure fatty acid 
fractions of breast adipose tissue during diagnostic breast 
magnetic resonance (MR) examinations and to investigate 
associations between fatty acid fractions in breast adipose 
tissue and breast cancer status by using this method.
Materials and 
Methods:
The institutional review board approved this retrospective 
HIPAA-compliant study and informed consent was waived. 
Between July 2013 and September 2014, multiple-echo 
three-dimensional gradient-echo data were acquired for 
89 women. Spectra were generated and used to estimate 
fractions of monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), polyun-
saturated fatty acid (PUFA), and saturated fatty acid (SFA) 
in the breast adipose tissue. Analysis of covariance and 
exact Mann-Whitney tests were used to compare groups 
and the Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used 
to characterize the association of each imaging measure 
with each attribute.
Results:
For postmenopausal women, MUFA was lower (0.38 6 
0.06 vs 0.46 6 0.10; P , .05) and SFA was higher (0.31 
6 0.07 vs 0.19 6 0.11; P , .05) for women with invasive 
ductal carcinoma than for those with benign tissue. No 
correlation was found between body mass index (BMI) 
and fatty acid fractions in breast adipose tissue. In women 
with benign tissue, postmenopausal women had a higher 
PUFA (0.35 6 0.06 vs 0.27 6 0.05; P , .01) and lower 
SFA (0.19 6 0.11 vs 0.30 6 0.12; P , .05) than premen-
opausal women.
Conclusion:
There is a possible link between the presence of invasive 
ductal carcinoma and fatty acid fractions in breast adipose 
tissue for postmenopausal women in whom BMI values 
are not correlated with the fatty acid fractions.

was to demonstrate the feasibility of 
the use of a rapid, noninvasive, in vivo 
imaging method to measure fatty acid 
fractions of breast adipose tissue dur-
ing diagnostic breast MR examinations 
and to investigate associations between 
fatty acid fractions in breast adipose 
tissue and breast cancer status by using 
this method.
Materials and Methods
Patients
This retrospective study was Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountabil-
ity Act compliant and was approved 
by our institutional review board. In-
formed consent was waived. This study 
included 113 women (mean age, 48 
years; age range, 24–77 years) who had 
an extra 5-minute examination of three-
dimensional 
multiple 
gradient-echo 
sequence at the end of their diagnostic 
MR examinations between July 2013 
and September 2014. Clinical indica-
tions for the MR examinations include 
known cancer, asymptomatic high-risk 
screening, follow-up of treated cancer, 
or symptoms suggestive of cancer. Pa-
tients with benign tissue (healthy tissue 
or benign lesions), ductal carcinoma 
analysis, ex vivo tissue spectroscopy, 
and in vivo spectroscopy (8–15).
Studies that evaluated the effect of 
the composition of dietary fat intake 
and cancer risk showed conflicting re-
sults (10,13). However, dietary surveys 
are subject to large estimation errors. In 
addition, adipose tissue composition dif-
fers from dietary intake values because 
some fatty acids can be manufactured 
in the body (16,17). Therefore, direct 
measures of fat composition may corre-
late more closely with cancer risk.
A 
small 
number 
of 
studies 
(8,9,12,15) used direct measures of 
monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), 
polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), 
and saturated fatty acids (SFAs) to ex-
amine the relationship between fatty 
acid fractions and breast cancer devel-
opment. These studies also found con-
flicting results. In some cases, higher 
MUFA (or lower SFA) was associated 
with a higher risk for cancer, while in 
other cases no association was found.
Few studies used noninvasive, in vivo 
methods to examine breast fatty acid 
fractions, and those that did used small 
sample sizes. In one study, fatty acid 
fractions were measured for a group of 
10 healthy volunteers by using hydrogen 
1 magnetic resonance (MR) spectros-
copy, but no comparison was made for 
patients with cancer (14). In another 
study, PUFA maps were acquired for 
six healthy volunteers and one patient 
with cancer. Each volunteer displayed a 
unique PUFA distribution, and the PUFA 
levels were decreased in the lesion of the 
patient with cancer (11).
One major obstacle to in vivo de-
termination of fatty acid fractions in a 
large patient population is the lack of 
methods that can be easily used in the 
clinic during a routine diagnostic imag-
ing protocol. The purpose of this study

Advances in Knowledge
 
n Multiple gradient-echo MR im-
aging can be used to acquire lipid 
spectra within a clinical diagnos-
tic imaging session and estimate 
fractions of saturated fatty acid 
(SFA), monounsaturated fatty 
acid (MUFA), and polyunsatu-
rated fatty acid (PUFA) in breast 
adipose tissue.
 
n For women after menopause, the 
presence of invasive ductal carci-
noma is associated with a lower 
fraction of MUFA (0.38 6 0.06 
vs 0.46 6 0.10; P , .05) and 
higher fraction of SFA (0.31 6 
0.07 vs 0.19 6 0.11; P , .05), 
compared with women with 
benign tissue.
 
n Women before menopause and 
postmenopausal women with 
benign tissue have significantly 
different fractions of PUFA (0.27 
6 0.05 vs 0.35 6 0.06; P , .01) 
and SFA (0.30 6 0.12 vs 0.19 6 
0.11; P , .05), so menopause 
may affect fatty acid fractions in 
breast adipose tissue.
Implication for Patient Care
 
n Fractions of fatty acids in breast 
adipose tissue may be important 
factors to consider for cancer 
diagnosis and/or understanding 
the underlying mechanisms 
behind cancer development in 
individual patients.
B
ody mass index (BMI) is an im-
portant risk factor for breast 
cancer development and invasive-
ness. After menopause, women have an 
increased risk of developing breast can-
cer with increased BMI, while increased 
BMI may provide a protective effect for 
women who have not entered meno-
pause (1–4). The exact mechanism be-
hind the increased risk in women after 
menopause is not fully understood, but 
one possibility is the increased produc-
tion of estrogen and/or adipokines by 
the adipose tissue (5), which becomes 
the principal site of estrogen biosynthe-
sis in postmenopausal women (6). An 
estimated 69% of adults in the United 
States are overweight or obese, which 
makes this modifiable risk factor an im-
portant target for study (7).
In addition to overall body fat, fat 
composition may play a role in cancer 
development. Fat composition can be 
measured by using a variety of different 
methods, including estimation from die-
tary fat intake surveys, ex vivo chemical

T1- and T2-weighted sequences fol-
lowed by a three-dimensional dynamic 
contrast-enhanced sequence. After 
the first frame of the dynamic contrast-
enhanced sequence, gadobutrol (Gada-
vist; Bayer Healthcare, Whippany, NJ) 
was injected at 2 mL/sec by using the 
standard dose of 0.1 mmol per kilo-
gram of body weight. This was followed 
by a saline flush with a power injector 
(Medrad, Indianola, Pa). Data acquired 
during the standard clinical protocol 
were used to estimate FGT density and 
background parenchymal enhancement 
as described in the Image Evaluation 
section. FGT was estimated from the 
patients’ most recent mammographic 
examinations.
Data for the spectral analysis were 
acquired after the standard clinical 
patients were BRCA negative and 19 
were BRCA positive. Breast cancer 
status was determined by a review 
of the patients’ electronic medical 
record and included any follow-up 
procedures. Forty-nine patients had 
benign breast tissue, 12 had ductal 
carcinoma in situ, and 28 had invasive 
ductal carcinoma.
Data Acquisition and Analysis
MR data acquisition.—MR imaging was 
performed by using a 3-T MR system 
(Tim Trio; Siemens, Erlangen, Ger-
many) and a dedicated seven-element 
bilateral breast coil (In Vivo, Orlando, 
Fla). All patients underwent a standard 
clinical diagnostic examination of both 
breasts in the prone position that con-
sisted of precontrast agent–enhanced 
in situ, or invasive ductal carcinoma 
were included in the study. Eleven pa-
tients were excluded from the analysis 
because their menopausal status could 
not be determined (one patient was 
taking prophylactic tamoxifen citrate 
 
at the time of the study, one had a 
previous oophorectomy, and nine had 
their last menstrual period more than 
36 days before the study) and 13 pa-
tients with benign tissue were excluded 
because they had a history of cancer. A 
total of 89 patients were included in the 
final analysis. Table 1 is a summary of 
patient characteristics.
Each patient’s height and weight 
were measured at the time of the exam-
ination and their BMI was calculated. 
Included were 58 premenopausal and 
31 postmenopausal women. Seventy

zero and first-order phase corrections. 
Next, a spectral model was fit to the 
data that consisted of 10 Voigt line pro-
files and a linear baseline. The positions 
of Voigt profiles were initially set to lit-
erature values and estimated from the 
data during the fit. This process was re-
peated, which allowed the eddy current 
and phase corrections to be free pa-
rameters in the spectral fit, until the fit 
converged. The eddy current and phase 
corrections that produced the optimal 
fit were saved and applied to the voxel 
that was analyzed. The spectral model 
parameters were discarded. In step 2, 
the voxel-wise corrected spectra were 
averaged over the entire user-drawn 
ROI in all sections to produce a final 
spectrum for each patient. For step 3, 
line areas for each patient were deter-
mined by fitting 10 Voigt line profiles 
and a linear baseline to the corrected 
and averaged spectrum. Figure 1 shows 
representative images without interpo-
lation with the ROI and corresponding 
spectrum and model fit for two example 
cases.
The fraction of SFA, MUFA, and 
PUFA were calculated from the line 
areas (by using peaks D, E, and, F in 
Fig 1) with previously reported methods 
(14,21). Briefly, PUFA = area (F)/area 
(E); MUFA = 0.5 area (D)/area (E) 2 
PUFA; and SFA = 1 2 PUFA 2 MUFA. 
In this estimation, it is assumed that 
the majority of PUFA is diunsaturated 
fatty acid. This assumption is on the 
basis that 97%–98% of total fat in hu-
mans who consume ordinary Western 
diets consists of MUFA, diunsaturated 
fatty acid, or SFA (21).
Phantom studies.—Spectroscopic 
data were also acquired from a phan-
tom that consisted of four tubes filled 
with different oils (olive, palm, high 
oleic sunflower, and flaxseed) and 
surrounded by water. Oils were pur-
chased from a local grocery store. 
Acquisition parameters were identical 
to the patient data, and analysis fol-
lowed the same procedure as for the 
patient data. ROIs were drawn to in-
clude most of voxels within each oil 
tube by reader 1 only in multiple sec-
tions, as described for the patient data 
analysis. The median values of fatty 
T1-weighted and subtraction images. 
Both the volume and intensity of en-
hancement were considered in this 
global assessment. Background paren-
chymal enhancement was classified by 
using the Breast Imaging Reporting and 
Data System, or BI-RADS, categories 
as none or minimal, mild, moderate, 
or marked (19,20).
Spectroscopic analysis.—For each 
three-dimensional slab of images, the 
first and last two sections were ex-
cluded from further analysis because 
of low signal-to-noise ratio and chemi-
cal shift. The remaining sections of the 
image corresponding to the first echo 
for all of the patients were presented 
in a blinded, randomized fashion to two 
operators (M.F., with 6 years of expe-
rience in analyzing breast dynamic con-
trast-enhanced MR imaging data, and 
A.A.L.), and a region of interest (ROI) 
was drawn for each section of each 
patient (8–10 partitions per patient). 
Each reader independently drew free-
form ROIs in the adipose tissue. The 
ROIs were selected to include areas of 
contiguous adipose tissue, while exclud-
ing areas of partial volume with fibro-
glandular tissue. The combined ROIs of 
multiple sections for each patient had 
1068 voxels 6 730 (standard deviation). 
 
Drawing the ROI was the only step in 
the analysis that required subjective 
user input.
After user-created ROIs were drawn, 
the spectral analysis was completed by 
using an automated, custom-writ-
ten script (IDL; Exelis, Herndon, Va). 
Spectra were generated by using the 
following steps: step 1, calculate a 
corrected spectrum for each voxel in-
dependently; step 2, average the cor-
rected spectra over all voxels in the 
user-drawn ROI to produce a single 
spectrum for each patient, and step 3, 
fit a spectral model to this final spec-
trum to estimate the area in the spec-
tral lines. Step 1 was achieved by deter-
mining the corrections that allowed the 
best fit to the selected spectral model. 
First, a spectrum was obtained by per-
forming a Fourier transform of the 
complex-valued gradient-echo image 
data along the echo dimension and ap-
plying an eddy current correction and 
protocol was completed to avoid dis-
rupting the normal clinical data acqui-
sition flow. These data consisted of a 
series of three-dimensional images ac-
quired at many different echo times. 
Therefore, each image represented 
a sample of the free induction decay 
curve at a time equal to the echo time. 
With this information, spatially re-
solved spectra were obtained by using 
the methods described in the Spectro-
scopic Analysis section. The data for 
spectral analysis were unilateral, sagit-
tal images acquired by using a three-
dimensional gradient-echo sequence 
and the following imaging parameters: 
number of echoes, 144; echo spacing, 
1.44 msec; repetition time (msec), 220; 
number of averages, one; flip angle, 10°; 
resolution, 2.8 mm 3 2.8 mm; section 
thickness, 2.8 mm; number of sections, 
12–18; imaging time, approximately 5 
minutes. T1-weighted corrections were 
not applied because sequence was per-
formed with minimal T1 weighting (long 
repetition time and very low flip angle). 
T2-weighted corrections were not ap-
plicable because data were acquired by 
using a gradient-echo sequence, not a 
spin-echo sequence.
Image evaluation.—Mammographic 
breast density data were obtained 
from the mammographic reports and 
were confirmed by a fellowship-trained 
breast imaging radiologist (L.M., with 
15 years of experience) and a 4th-year 
resident (A.A.L.). By using the MR 
imaging data, women were evaluated 
for FGT and background parenchymal 
enhance 
ment. FGT was defined as 
nonfat, noncystic breast parenchyma 
(18). A four-point scale, similar to that 
used by the American College of Radi-
ology to classify mammographic den-
sity, was used to classify the relative 
amount of FGT: score of 1, fatty breasts 
(,25% glandular); score of 2, scat-
tered fibroglandular density (25%–50% 
glandular); score of 3, heterogeneously 
dense breasts (51%–75% glandular); 
and score of 4, dense breasts (.75% 
glandular) (19). Background parenchy-
mal enhancement was visually assessed 
for the entire breast parenchyma by 
using a combination of unenhanced 
and contrast-enhanced fat-suppressed

the x2 test for the rest with more than 
two categories. By using data from 
women with benign pathologic results, 
exact Mann-Whitney tests were used 
to compare pre- and postmenopausal 
women and compare BRCA carriers 
and noncarriers in terms of each im-
aging measure. The Spearman rank 
correlation coefficient was used to

imaging measure with each ordinal 
and numeric attribute.

and background parenchymal enhance-
ment. The normality assumption un-
derlying the analysis of covariance was 
assessed by applying a Shapiro-Wilk 
test to the residuals from each analysis 
of covariance model. In addition, com-
parisons of individual factors between 
two diagnostic groups were conducted 
by using unequal variance two-tailed 
t test for age and BMI, Fisher exact 
test for menopause and BRCA, and 
acid fractions estimated for individual 
voxels with the ROIs were compared 
with those from the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture National Nutrient Data-
base for Standard Reference (22).
Statistical Analysis
Analysis of covariance was used to 
compare diagnostic groups in terms 
of each numeric imaging measure 
adjusted for subject-level attributes, 
including age, BMI, BRCA status,

Reader agreement for the esti-
mated MUFA, PUFA, and SFA values 
was moderate. The intraclass correla-
tion coefficient for MUFA, PUFA, and 
SFA was 0.70, 0.79, and 0.80, respec-
tively. The coefficient of variation for 
MUFA, PUFA, and SFA was 12.9%, 
11.6%, 
and 
19.8%, 
respectively. 
 
Figure 3 shows Bland-Altman plots for 
the reader agreement. Despite moder-
ate reader agreement in the estimated 
fatty acid fractions, several relation-
ships were found to be significant for 
both of the readers. Results for the 
more experienced reader, reader 1, are 
presented in the text and in Tables 2–4. 
 
Full results for both readers can be 
found in the supplemental materials 
(Tables E1–E3 [online]).
A comparison of fatty acid fractions 
between diagnostic groups was per-
formed separately for pre- and post-
menopausal women (Table 2, Fig 4). 
 
For premenopausal women, no signifi-
cant differences in fatty acid fractions 
were observed between diagnostic 
groups (P = .576–.795). For postmeno-
pausal women, MUFA was significantly 
higher (P = .039) for women with be-
nign tissue (mean, 0.46 6 0.10; n = 14) 
than those with invasive ductal carci-
noma (mean, 0.38 6 0.06; n = 12). In 
addition, SFA was significantly lower (P 
= .005) for women with benign tissue 
(mean, 0.19 6 0.11; n = 14) than those 
with invasive ductal carcinoma (mean, 
0.31 6 0.07; n = 12). No significant

Results
Figure 2 shows the distribution of line 
widths for all patients. These line widths 
were calculated as the full width at half 
maximum of the Voigt profile fit to line 
B in Figure 1. The average and standard 
deviation full width at half maximum are 
13.9 Hz and 3.0 Hz, respectively.
The analysis was completed for 
each reader and only those com-
parisons for which a P value of less 
than .05 was found for both readers 
were considered significant. Reader 
agreement was assessed in terms of 
the 95% limits of agreement from a 
Bland-Altman analysis, intraclass cor-
relation coefficient, and the intrasu-
bject coefficient of variation. All sta-
tistical tests were conducted at the 
two-sided 5% significance level by

(P = .281–.376). Mammographic den-
sity was positively correlated with SFA 
(r = 0.31; P = .029). FGT was nega-
tively correlated with PUFA (r = 20.34; 
P = .018) and positively correlated with 
SFA (r = 0.29; P = .041). Background 
parenchymal enhancement was nega-
tively correlated with PUFA (r = 20.49; 
P , .001) and positively correlated with 
SFA (r = 0.37; P = .010). Finally, age 
was positively correlated with PUFA (r 
= 0.40; P = .005) and negatively corre-
lated with SFA (r = 20.30; P = .036).
For women with benign tissue, post-
menopausal women had a significantly 
higher PUFA (P , .001) and lower SFA 
(P = .006) than did premenopausal 
women (Table 4, Fig 4). No significant 
difference was observed for MUFA (P = 
.453). No differences in fatty acid frac-
tions in breast adipose tissue were 
evident between BRCA-negative and

causal factors in cancer development, 
to understand endogenous processes 
that influence SFA and MUFA would 
be an interesting focus of future in-
vestigations. One possibility recently 
investigated is the link between fatty 
acid composition and an enzyme asso-
ciated with cancer, stearoyl-coenzyme 
A desaturase 1 (23,24). The poor cor-
relation between dietary intake and tis-
sue values may explain the discrepancy 
between our results and those of stud-
ies that use dietary intake estimates 
to estimate fatty acid composition. In 
dietary intake studies, PUFA correlates 
more strongly with cancer development 
than either SFA or MUFA (10,13).
Few studies have used direct 
methods to investigate how fatty acid 
fractions correlate with breast cancer. 
In a study of 225 women, Mamala-
kis et al (12) found that patients with 
breast cancer have lower MUFA and 
higher levels of a specific SFA in glu-
teal adipose tissue than healthy control 
subjects. Their results are consistent 
with those of our study. Victor et al 
(25) estimated fatty acid composition 
in more than 50 ex vivo breast samples 
by using carbon 13 MR spectroscopy 
for patients with cancer and healthy 
patients. They found no significant dif-
ference between the MUFA, PUFA, or 
SFA of adipose tissue in cancer versus 
healthy patients; however, they did find 
we were able to directly measure the 
in vivo fatty acid fractions in a larger 
sample of patients than was previously 
possible.
By using this method, we found that 
SFA was higher and MUFA was lower 
for postmenopausal women with inva-
sive ductal carcinoma compared with 
those with benign tissue. This suggests 
that high SFA and low MUFA may be 
associated with invasive cancer. Be-
cause the population examined in this 
study included patients scheduled for 
high-risk screening, follow-up, or sus-
picion of cancer, they were an inher-
ently high-risk group. Thus more stud-
ies are needed in low-risk patients to 
assess if similar differences are found. 
No difference in fatty acid fractions 
was observed among premenopausal 
groups. Differences in trends between 
premenopausal and postmenopausal 
women were also observed in studies 
of BMI (1–4). It is not clear from the 
data whether or not there is a causal 
relationship between SFA and MUFA 
levels and the development of invasive 
disease. If there is a causal relationship, 
it may point to internal biologic factors 
as more important to invasive cancer 
development than dietary intake. This 
is because both SFA and MUFA are cre-
ated endogenously in the body and are 
not well correlated with dietary intake 
(16,17). If SFA and MUFA are indeed 
BRCA-positive women with benign tis-
sue (P = .632–0.782).
Figure 5 shows results of the vali-
dation of the technique by using data 
acquired with four different oils. Olive, 
palm, and sunflower oils all provide a 
good match to the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture values. In flaxseed oil, 
MUFA is overestimated and PUFA is 
underestimated because PUFA of flax-
seed oil has a large component that is 
not diunsaturated fatty acid. For flax-
seed oil, diunsaturated fatty acid com-
poses about 21% of PUFA, whereas it is 
93% for olive, 98% for palm, and 95% 
for sunflower. These phantom results 
demonstrate the proposed method to 
estimate fatty acid fractions works well 
when diunsaturated fatty acid is the 
major component of PUFA (21).
Discussion
In this study, fatty acid fractions in 
breast adipose tissue were estimated 
by using a rapid in vivo technique that 
allowed spatially resolved spectra to 
be acquired during a standard diag-
nostic imaging session. This method 
is relatively straightforward to include 
in the standard clinical workflow com-
pared with traditional MR imaging 
spectroscopy because it does not re-
quire complicated shimming and has 
a short acquisition time. Therefore,

Given the conflicting results re-
ported in the literature, there is clearly 
a need for additional studies and 
methods that can accurately measure 
fat tissue composition. Our study takes 
a step in that direction by implement-
ing a method that can directly measure 
fatty acid fractions in vivo in large pa-
tient populations.
In the absence of data on the final 
outcome of our patient cohort, we an-
alyzed correlations between fatty acid 
fractions and other risk factors for 
women with benign tissue to investigate 
whether fat composition may relate to 
abdominal tissue samples in 161 women 
with invasive breast cancer and benign 
tissue. No significant difference was ob-
served in the fat composition between 
these two groups, even when grouped 
by menopausal status. Finally, de Bree 
et al (15) found that higher PUFA was 
associated with reduced odds of breast 
cancer in premenopausal women when 
94 women with breast cancer were 
compared with 57 women with benign 
lesions. No difference in MUFA or SFA 
was observed for either pre- or post-
menopausal women after correcting for 
confounding factors.
that cancer tissue had lower MUFA and 
higher SFA than noncancerous tissue. 
While our study measured only adi-
pose tissue in patients with cancer, not 
cancerous tissue itself, we did find that 
patients with cancer had adipose tis-
sue with lower MUFA and higher SFA 
than those with benign tissue. The fact 
that Victor et al (25) did not see differ-
ences in noncancerous adipose tissue 
between cancer and healthy patients 
may be because of a difference in the 
cancer stage distribution of our two 
studies. Petrek et al (9) measured the 
fat composition in ex vivo breast and

composes about 21% of PUFA, whereas it is 93% for olive, 98% for palm, and 95% for sunflower. The proposed method works well when diunsaturated fatty 
acid is the major component of PUFA, which is the case for olive, sunflower, and palm oil, but not for flaxseed oil.

patients at normal risk are warranted 
to further investigate the association of 
fatty acid fractions with breast cancer. 
While we used a phantom with four dif-
ferent oils to validate our method, we 
did not have a reference standard for 
in vivo measurements. An MR imaging 
spectroscopy method, such as local-
ized correlated spectroscopy (28), may 
be used for cross-validation in future 
studies.
Another limitation of our study was 
that data were acquired after contrast 
agent administration. This means that 
the spectral lines may be broadened 
compared with precontrast line widths 
(29–31), which may lead to increased 
uncertainty in the measurements. We 
are not aware of previous studies that 
reported lipid line widths; however, sev-
eral studies reported precontrast cho-
line line widths. Sijens et al (29) found 
full width at half maximum of 11.52 Hz 
6 0.22, Joe et al (31) found line widths 
ranging from approximately 6 to 14 Hz, 
and Smith et al (30) found line widths 
that ranged from 3.65 to 14.45 Hz. We 
expect lipid line widths to be larger than 
those for choline, which is inherently 
narrower because of its longer T2. The 
line widths in our study (full width at 
half maximum, 13.9 Hz 6 3.0) appear 
reasonable given the published values 
of choline and the wider expected line 
widths for lipids. In addition, we expect 
line broadening from contrast agent 
to be minimal in lipids because of the 
lower uptake compared with tumors. 
Even in the presence of broadening, the 
relative nature of our fatty acid fraction 
estimates mitigates any differences in 
line broadening between patients.
In conclusion, we used a rapid 
method that can be used to acquire 
MR imaging spectra during a standard 
clinical diagnostic imaging session. 
This technique enables the direct mea-
surement of fat composition in vivo in 
breast adipose tissue in large patient 
populations. Our study demonstrated 
that, for postmenopausal women, low 
monounsaturated and high saturated 
the future risk of developing breast can-
cer. Interestingly, BMI did not correlate 
with fat composition even though BMI 
is a known risk factor for developing 
breast cancer (1). Therefore, BMI and 
fat composition may affect cancer risk 
via independent mechanisms; however, 
this conclusion is limited because of our 
relatively small sample size. Given that 
MUFA and SFA are not closely linked 
with dietary intake values, it may make 
sense that BMI and fat composition in-
fluence risk via different mechanisms if 
BMI is influenced by dietary intake, for 
example.
Our study also showed differences 
in breast fatty acid fractions between 
pre- and postmenopausal women with 
benign tissue. This indicates that meno-
pause may cause changes in fat compo-
sition. Menopause is already known to 
affect the production and concentration 
of hormones, such as estrogen (25–27), 
and the amount and distribution of ad-
ipose tissue through the body (26). 
Therefore, menopausal status should 
be taken into account when assessing 
the effects of fat composition.
Our study failed to show any differ-
ences in fatty acid fractions in breast 
adipose tissue between BRCA-positive 
and BRCA-negative women with benign 
tissue. An in vivo study that compared 
BRCA-positive 
and 
BRCA-negative 
women by using two-dimensional corre-
lated spectroscopy did find increases in 
lipid unsaturation levels for BRCA car-
riers in fibroglandular tissue (28). Their 
study did not look at adipose tissue 
and, therefore, it is difficult to compare 
it directly with our study. However, the 
ability of two-dimensional spectroscopy 
to separate overlapping resonances that 
cannot be resolved in one-dimensional 
spectroscopy may mean that they were 
able to detect differences to which our 
study was not sensitive.
Limitations of this study include a 
relatively small sample size. In addition, 
the population in this study included 
patients who underwent diagnostic 
MR imaging for a clinical indication of 
known cancer, asymptomatic high-risk 
screening, follow-up of treated can-
cer, or symptoms suggestive of cancer. 
Therefore, all patients in the study,
