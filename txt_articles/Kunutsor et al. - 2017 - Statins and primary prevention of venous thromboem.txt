 Summary 
Background Statins have been suggested to have a protective effect on venous 
thromboembolism (VTE) (which includes deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism), 
but the evidence is uncertain. We sought to evaluate the extent to which statins are associated 
with first VTE outcomes. 
Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational cohort 
studies and randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Relevant studies which reported associations 
between statins and first VTE outcomes were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of 
Science, Cochrane Library, manual search of bibliographies to July 2016, and email 
correspondence with investigators. Study specific relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence 
intervals were aggregated using random effects models and were grouped by study level 
characteristics. The review has been registered in the PROSPERO prospective register of 
systematic reviews (CRD42016035622). 
Findings There were 36 eligible studies (13 cohort studies comprising 3 148 259 participants 
and 23 RCTs of statins versus placebo or no treatment, comprising 118 464 participants). In 
observational studies, the pooled RR for VTE was 0·75 (0·65-0·87) when comparing statin 
use with no use. This association remained consistent when grouped by various study level 
characteristics. In RCTs, the RR for VTE was 0·85 (0·73-0·99) comparing statin therapy with 
placebo or no treatment. Subgroup analyses suggested significant differences in the effect of 
statins by type of statin, with rosuvastatin having the lowest risk on VTE compared to other 
statins 0·57 (0·42-0·75). There was no evidence of an effect of statin use on pulmonary 
embolism. 
Interpretation Available evidence from observational and intervention studies suggest a 
beneficial effect of statin use on VTE. In intervention studies, therapy with rosuvastatin 
significantly reduced VTE compared to other statins. Further evidence is however needed to 
validate these findings. 
 
Funding This study received no external funding.

Introduction 
Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and 
pulmonary embolism (PE) is a public health problem. Although pharmacologic 
thromboprophylaxis agents (such as unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparins, 
warfarin, and novel oral anticoagulants) are effective, they remain underused, because they 
are associated with increased risk of bleeding.(1) The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme 
A reductase inhibitors (commonly known as statins), are known for their lipid-lowering 
properties and well established for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular 
disease (CVD),(2-4) especially coronary heart disease.(5)   Statins are also known to have 
pleiotropic effects that affect coagulation and inflammation, and do not increase bleeding 
risk.(6, 7) There is emerging evidence to suggest that through these pleiotropic effects, statins 
may be effective in reducing the incidence of VTE. Since the publication of the Heart and 
Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS), which reported an approximately 50 percent 
risk reduction in VTE in a nonrandomised comparison of statin versus nonstatin users,(8) 
several observational studies have evaluated this relationship and reported conflicting 
results.(9-13) In the first randomised controlled trial (RCT) of statins for the prevention of 
VTE, investigators of the Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention 
Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial of 17 802 participants, demonstrated that 
rosuvastatin significantly reduced the occurrence of all cases of VTE.(14) These results were 
based on relatively few VTE events suggesting a statistical play of chance and thus triggered 
calls for further studies to replicate these results.(15) With the publication of these studies, 
there have been efforts to aggregate these data over the last decade and which have resulted in 
a number of published reviews on the topic with inconsistent results.(16-19) In analysis of 
eight case-control studies and three cohort studies, Squizzato and colleagues showed no 
 evidence of a significant reduction in VTE with statin use, when the results were pooled by 
study design; however, pooled analysis of all studies (including the JUPITER trial) showed a 
significant reduction in risk of VTE.(17) In a meta-analysis of 29 RCTs published in 2012, 
Rahimi and colleagues found no significant reduction in VTE events with statin therapy.(19)  
 
Indeed, the existing evidence shows there is still uncertainty regarding the effect of statins on 
VTE outcomes. In addition, there were several features of these previous reviews which 
limited the generalisability and validity of the findings. First, majority of these previous 
reviews (except for the study by Rahimi and colleagues(19)) pooled a limited number of 
studies which did not provide adequate power to evaluate the associations. Second, several of 
these reviews pooled results of different study designs making interpretation of the findings 
difficult. Third, these previous reviews did not conduct detailed exploration of potential 
sources of heterogeneity among the contributing studies using formal tests such as subgroup 
analyses and meta-regression techniques. The topic is under considerable debate and of 
clinical interest as an increasing number of people are being prescribed statin therapy; and 
given the publication of newer studies since the last relevant meta-analysis on the topic, there 
is a need for further work to address the persisting uncertainties on the role of statins on VTE 
outcomes. In this context, we aimed to summarise the available observational and 
interventional evidence in one updated systematic meta-analysis. Our objectives were to (i) 
determine the associations of statin use with risk of first VTE outcomes in observational 
cohort studies; (ii) quantify the effects of statin use given alone compared with placebo (or no 
treatment) for the primary prevention of VTE outcomes in RCTs; and (iii) examine all 
associations under a wide range of relevant study level characteristics. 
 
Methods 
Data sources and search strategy  
We conducted this review using a predefined protocol, which has been registered in the 
PROSPERO prospective register of systematic reviews (CRD42016035622), and in 
 accordance with PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines(20, 21) (Pages 2-5 of 
SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL). Two authors independently sought studies published 
before July, 2016 (date last searched) using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the 
Cochrane electronic databases. The computer-based searches combined terms related to 
statins (e.g., statin, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors, atorvastatin, 
simvastatin) and outcomes (e.g., venous thromboembolism, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary 
embolism) in humans, without any language restriction. Details on the search strategy are 
provided in Page 6 of SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL. Two reviewers working 
independently screened the titles and abstracts of all initially identified studies according to 
the selection criteria. Full texts were retrieved from studies that satisfied all selection criteria. 
Reference lists of selected studies and relevant reviews identified on the topic were manually 
scanned for additional publications.  
 
Study selection and eligibility criteria  
Observational cohort (prospective cohort, retrospective cohort, or nested case-control) studies 
were eligible for inclusion if they assessed the association of any or current statin use with 
first VTE, DVT, or PE event (as detected by imaging using venous ultrasonography, 
venography, angiography, computed tomography, ventilation and perfusion scan, or any other 
recognised confirmatory tests) in adults (≥ 18 years old). Intervention studies were eligible if 
they were randomised controlled, open or blinded trials; assessed the effects of statin therapy 
compared to a placebo or no treatment in adults; and collected VTE outcomes. Studies were 
excluded if they were non-randomised comparing statin with another statin or lipid-lowering 
agent or were secondary publications of trials already included in the analysis. In addition, 
case-control studies and studies that reported the associations between statin therapy and 
recurrent VTE were excluded.   
 
Data extraction  
 Two authors (SKK and SS) independently extracted data and a consensus was reached in case 
of any inconsistency with involvement of a third (KK). We used a predesigned data extraction 
form to obtain relevant information. These included study-level information on study design; 
baseline population including proportion of men; location; average age at baseline; numbers 
enrolled and randomised; allocation concealment; blinding; statin type and dosage; duration 
of treatment or follow-up; degree of adjustment for potential confounders (defined as ‘+’ 
when RRs were adjusted for age and/or sex; ‘++’ further adjustment for established risk 
factors for VTE such as body mass index, history of diabetes, smoking status, exercise, 
alcohol consumption, immobilization, ; and ‘+++’ additional adjustment for other potential 
confounders such as estrogen use or use of anticoagulants); treatment comparisons; and nature 
of outcome and numbers. Venous thromboembolism outcomes were extracted as reported by 
the eligible studies. The primary outcome of this analysis was VTE which was reported by 
majority of studies. Data on the specific endpoints of DVT and PE were also extracted when 
reported. We extracted risk estimates reported for the greatest degree of adjustment. If risk 
estimates were unavailable from a published report, we collected relevant data by abstracting 
from other published reviews or by contacting investigators of these published studies.  In the 
case of multiple publications involving the same study, the most up-to-date or comprehensive 
information was abstracted.  
 
Assessing the risk of bias  
For observational cohort studies, we used the nine-star Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS),(22) 
which is based on pre-defined criteria namely: selection (population representativeness), 
comparability (adjustment for confounders), and ascertainment of outcome. The NOS assigns 
a maximum of four points for selection, two points for comparability, and three points for 
outcome. Nine points on the NOS reflects the highest study quality. For RCTs, we used the 
Cochrane Collaboration’s risk of bias tool.(23) This tool evaluates seven possible sources of 
bias: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and 
personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and 
 other bias. For each individual domain, studies were classified into low, unclear and high risk 
of bias.  
 
Statistical analysis  
Summary measures were presented as relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs). Following Cornfield’s rare disease assumption,(24) hazard ratios and odds ratios were 
assumed to approximate the same measure of RR. When studies published more than one 
estimate of the association according to subgroups (e.g., by sex, dosage), we obtained a 
within-study summary estimate using a fixed effect meta-analysis. The inverse variance 
weighted method was used to combine summary measures using random-effects models to 
minimise the effect of between-study  heterogeneity.(25) Subsidiary analyses employed fixed 
effects models. Statistical heterogeneity across studies was quantified using the Cochrane χ2 
statistic and the I2 statistic.(26) Study-level characteristics [such as geographical location, 
study design, baseline population (general populations versus populations with pre-existing 
disease or at high VTE risk), allocation concealment, statin class, statin dosage (high versus 
low dose), source of data (for RCTs), and study quality] were pre-specified for assessment of 
heterogeneity, which was conducted using stratified analyses and random effects meta- 
regression.(27) In analysis specified post-hoc which was based on distribution of available 
data, further stratified analysis was conducted to examine the difference in pooled RRs by 
baseline average age of participants, duration of follow-up or treatment, and number of 
outcomes. We assessed the potential for publication bias through formal tests, namely Begg’s 
funnel plots and Egger’s regression symmetry tests.(28) All statistical tests were two-sided 
and used a significance level of P<0.05 and STATA release 14 (StataCorp LP, College 
Station, TX, USA) software was used for all statistical analyses.

Results 
Study identification and selection  
Our initial search of relevant databases and manual scanning of reference lists identified 1125 
potentially relevant citations. After screening based on titles and abstracts, 54 articles 
remained for full text evaluation. Following detailed assessments, 18 articles were excluded 
because (i) they were based on reviews (n = 8); (ii) they were case-control studies (n = 7); or 
evaluated recurrent outcomes (n = 3) (Pages 7-8 of SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL). The 
remaining 36 studies met our inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis (figure 
1; Pages 9-16 of SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL). Table 1 provides summary 
characteristics of relevant observational cohort studies and RCTs included in the meta-
analysis. 
 
 
Study characteristics and quality  
Pages 9-10 of SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL provides details of the key characteristics as 
well as quality assessment scores of observational cohort studies included in the review. In 
aggregate, there were 13 studies (published between 2001 and 2014) involving 3 148 259 
participants and 49 117 VTE outcomes. Twelve studies reported on VTE (3 022 397 
participants; 49 117 events), two on DVT (142 412 participants; 4513 events), and one on PE 
(16 550 participants; 3006 events). Except for one study with an average follow-up of 30 days 
for VTE outcomes, the median (interquartile range) duration of follow-up was 4·6 (2·6-7·4) 
years. Of these observational cohort studies, eight involved participants from Europe (UK, 
Finland, Austria, and Netherlands), three from North America (USA and Canada), and two 
from Asia (Saudi-Arabia and Israel). Quality scores of the studies ranged from 5 to 8. 
 
A total of 23 RCTs involving 118 464 participants and 1031 VTE outcomes were included in 
the review (table 1 and Pages 11-13 of SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL). Some baseline 
 data and risk estimates for VTE outcomes in 20 of these trials were extracted from a 
published review,(19) because these data had not been reported in the original articles. 
Rahimi and colleagues obtained these data from investigators of these trials and have 
appropriately acknowledged this in their review. We have also verified this by contacting 
authors of these published studies. The majority (n=17) of trials were double-blinded and six 
were open label trials. Majority of trials were conducted multinationally or within the 
European region (Scotland, Ireland, The Netherlands, Germany, and Italy). The baseline age 
of participants ranged from 18 to 90 years. Included trials employed different types of statin 
(artovastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, or rosuvastatin) with dosages 
ranging from 10 mg to 80 mg daily and the median (interquartile range) duration of follow-up 
was 3·9 (2·5-5·0) years. Using the Cochrane Collaboration tool, only six trials demonstrated a 
high risk of bias within one area of study quality, which was blinding of participants and 
personnel. All trials had a low risk of bias in random sequence generation and had an unclear 
risk of bias in one or more areas of study quality (Page 17 of SUPPLEMENTARY 
MATERIAL). There was considerable variability in study populations for both observational 
cohort studies and RCTs, which included participants recruited from general populations, 
participants at high vascular risk, participants with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, 
heart failure, cancer, as well as renal transplant patients and patients with mild to moderate 
Alzheimer’s disease. All studies reported on the use of statin for the primary prevention of 
VTE outcomes. 
 
Association of statin use with VTE in prospective cohort studies 
Figure 2 presents RRs for VTE outcomes for statin use compared with no statin use in 
observational cohort studies contributing to pooled analysis. A significant reduction in risk of 
VTE was found with statin use compared with no statin use 0·75 (95% CI: 0·65 to 0·87; 
p<0·0001). In sensitivity analyses, the combined RR excluding the study with less than one 
year follow-up was 0·75 (0·65-0·87; p<0·0001), which was identical to the main finding. 
There was evidence of substantial heterogeneity between the contributing studies (I2=82%, 70 
 to 89%; p<0·0001) which was partly explained by several study level characteristics such as 
geographical location (p for meta-regression = 0·014), study design (p for meta-regression = 
0·001), baseline population (p for meta-regression < 0·0001), study size (p for meta-
regression < 0·0001), and study quality (p for meta-regression = 0·026). A stronger 
association was observed in populations with pre-existing disease or at high VTE risk 0·46 
(95% CI: 0·25 to 0·83; p=0·010) compared to studies that recruited participants from the 
general population 0·86 (95% CI: 0·80 to 0·92; p<0·0001) (figure 3). In further exploration of 
heterogeneity, this was substantially reduced when pooled analysis was limited to prospective 
cohort designs (I2=58%, 8 to 81%; p=0·020) and the pooled result was attenuated but a 
protective association was still evident 0·88 (0·81-0·96; p=0·004). Similar results were 
observed when analysis was limited to studies that recruited participants from general 
populations. 
Statin use compared to no statin use was also associated with a significant reduction in risk of 
the specific endpoint of DVT 0·77 (95% CI: 0·69 to 0·86; p<0·0001). There was no evidence 
of heterogeneity between the two studies included in this analysis. In one study reporting PE 
outcomes, the RR for PE comparing statin use with no statin use was 1·02 (95% CI: 0·74 to 
1·40; p=0·90). 
 
 
Effects of statin therapy on VTE in randomised controlled trials 
Statin therapy compared with placebo or no treatment, was associated with a significant 
reduction in risk of VTE events in pooled analysis of 23 trials 0·85 (95% CI: 0·73 to 0·99; 
p=0·038) (figure 4). There was no evidence of substantial heterogeneity between the 
contributing studies (I2=13%, 0 to 47%; p=0·28).  The pooled RR remained unchanged using 
a fixed effects model 0·85 (95% CI: 0·73 to 0·99; p=0·032). In subgroup analyses, the effect 
of statin therapy on VTE risk did not vary significantly across several study level 
characteristics, except for by statin class (p for meta-regression = 0·015). Populations on 
rosuvastatin therapy had a significant reduction in VTE events compared to other statins. The 
 risk of VTE was statistically significantly reduced for general populations compared to 
populations with pre-existing disease or at high risk of VTE. Similarly, compared to high dose 
artovastatin or rosuvastatin, low doses of each of these statins were associated with a 
statistically significant reduced risk of VTE (figure 5). In the single largest trial that also 
reported results for the specific endpoints of DVT and PE; whiles a significant reduction in 
risk of DVT was found for statin therapy, there was no significant effect on PE (figure 4). 
 
Publication bias  
Under visual examination, funnel plots for both observational cohort studies and RCTs were 
symmetrical and Egger’s regression tests showed no statistical evidence of publication bias 
(Page 18 of SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL).  
 
Discussion 
Key findings 
The findings of this review indicate a protective effect of statin use in the primary prevention 
of VTE in both observational cohort and intervention studies. The inverse association 
demonstrated in observational studies remained consistent across several study level 
subgroups. In RCTs, there was suggestion of effect modification in stratified analyses by type 
of statin. Rosuvastatin therapy substantially and significantly reduced VTE risk, with no 
benefit seen with other statins. There was no evidence of a protective effect of statins on the 
specific outcome of PE in both observational cohort and intervention studies. 
 
Comparison with previous work 
A number of reviews have been conducted on the topic and some of our findings concur with 
those of these previous reviews. In a meta-analysis of 10 studies (comprising one RCT and a 
mixture of case-control, retrospective, and prospective cohort studies), Agarwal and 
colleagues reported a decreased risk of VTE outcomes with statin use.(16) Pai and colleagues 
in pooled analysis of four case-control and four cohort studies showed a statistically 
 significant reduction in risk of VTE.(18) In agreement with the results of these previous 
reviews, our pooled analysis of observational studies demonstrated a significant reduction in 
risk of VTE. However, our updated review of observational cohort studies also provides 
several important findings that have not been previously reported. Based on inclusion of 
additional studies, we had enhanced power to examine the associations in greater depth, such 
as the detailed exploration of sources of heterogeneity using a broader range of individual and 
study level circumstances. Our analyses suggested differences in the effect of statin use on 
VTE events by characteristics such as geographical location, study design, baseline 
population, and study size. Our review of RCTs provide several relevant findings that were 
not previously reported by the last relevant review published on the topic.(19) We found a 
significant reduction in VTE in pooled analysis of 23 RCTs of statin therapy compared with 
placebo or no treatment. Stratified analyses by several study level characteristics suggested 
evidence of effect modification by statin type, with rosuvastatin showing a beneficial effect 
on VTE compared to other statins. There were also suggestions of differences in the effect of 
statin on VTE by baseline population and statin dose; however, there was no statistically 
significant evidence of effect modification in these analyses. 
 
Possible explanations for findings 
The statistically significant findings in our pooled analyses of RCTs are not in stark contrast 
to findings of Rahimi and colleagues.(19)  The risk estimate reported in the previous review 
was consistent with a potential benefit of statin on VTE, but was on the verge of statistical 
significance. This could be attributed to low power to detect an effect. The addition of results 
of a new and larger trial to the pooled evidence may have resulted in enhanced power to show 
a significant risk reduction in VTE. Our findings from both observational and interventional 
evidence do suggest that statins may indeed have a protective effect on VTE. Statins in 
addition to their lipid-lowering properties are known to have several vascular protective 
effects which are independent of changes in cholesterol profiles, and these have been 
attributed to anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic properties; alteration of endothelial 
 dysfunction which leads to increased nitric oxide production; and regulation of 
angiogenesis.(29) Factors implicated in the pathogenesis of VTE include endothelial 
dysfunction, alterations in blood flow, and hypercoagulable states.(30) Given the major role 
of the coagulation cascade in the development of VTE, several related mechanisms have been 
postulated for the protective effect of statins on risk of VTE. First, growing evidence from 
both human studies and animal models suggest that statins downregulate the blood 
coagulation cascade, leading to reduced tissue factor expression, which causes reduced 
thrombin formation.(31-34) Second, statins via increased expression of thrombomodulin on 
the endothelial cells, may enhance the activity of the protein C anticoagulation system, which 
inhibits the coagulation cascade.(35) Third, statins also decrease the susceptibility for 
thrombosis and coagulation, by decreasing plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 expression(36) 
and increasing tissue plasminogen activator. In addition, profibrinolytic and antiplatelet 
properties have also been reported.(29, 37) Statins have been shown to modulate fibrin clot 
properties in both healthy individuals and those with previous VTE.(38) A recent review has 
also suggested that the antithrombotic effects of statins are likely to be linked to their anti-
inflammatory properties.(39)  
 
Whether VTE reduction is a class effect of statins is uncertain given the existing limited and 
inconsistent evidence.(12, 40) In our subgroup analyses of RCTs, we found evidence 
suggesting a difference in the effect of statin on VTE by type of statin, with rosuvastatin 
having a significant beneficial effect on risk of VTE compared to other statins. However, 
given that we were unable to conduct a head-to-head comparison of the statins and the limited 
number of studies available for such subgroup analyses, these findings may have arisen from 
the effects of low statistical power or chance. Further investigation is therefore needed to 
replicate and validate these results. 
 
Implications of our findings 
 Several implications exist for our findings. Based on both observational and clinical trial 
evidence, these findings underscore a potential beneficial role of statin therapy on VTE in 
addition to its established role in CVD prevention. The results also suggest that this effect of 
statins may be attributed to rosuvastatin. Currently, statins are only approved for lipid 
lowering in the primary and secondary prevention of CVD;(41) however, they have shown 
great promise beyond their established lipid-lowering effects and these include potential 
beneficial impact on multiple disease conditions.(42) In addition, statins have a good safety 
profile, are affordable, and widely used. These results provide an extensive body of evidence 
on the clinical benefit of statin in the occurrence of VTE and may support a true protective 
effect. Venous thromboembolism affects several millions of people globally and is one of the 
most preventable causes of hospital deaths.(43) Prevention of VTE may be another potential 
indication of statins; however, before any guideline recommendations should be made, further 
research is needed to unequivocably establish this potential true protective effect. In addition, 
the role of statins in the secondary prevention of VTE is of emerging clinical interest. 
However, only a limited number of studies have explored the effect of statins on VTE 
recurrence and the results have mostly been based on administrative data and are conflicting. 
(44, 45) In a post-hoc analysis of the EINSTEIN DVT and PE study, there was no statistically 
significant reduction in the risk of recurrent VTE comparing statin-users with non-users.(46)  
Further investigation is also required to evaluate the putative preventive effect of statins in 
VTE recurrence. 
  
Strengths and limitations 
Our systematic review and meta-analysis has several strengths in comparison to previous 
reviews and these deserve mention. Our review included analyses of observational evidence 
as well as clinical trial data in a single investigation; thus providing the most comprehensive 
update on the effect of statin therapy on VTE. Our search strategy was very detailed, was 
without language restriction, and spanned multiple databases. Most of our trial evidence was 
based on unpublished data which was recently published by a recent elegant review.(19) 
 Indeed, formal tests showed no evidence of publication bias in our analyses. The 
generalisability of our findings was enhanced by the involvement of data from 13 
observational studies and 23 RCTs, making it the largest review to date on the topic. There 
was enhanced power, therefore the ability to quantify more reliably the magnitude of the 
associations as well as conduct detailed analyses under a wider range of study-level 
circumstances. Given the data available, we were able to systematically explore possible 
sources of heterogeneity using stratified and meta-regression analyses. A detailed assessment 
of methodological quality of the included studies was conducted; observational cohort studies 
were all of adequate quality and majority of the intervention studies had low risk of bias. In 
our review of observational evidence, we included only observational cohorts, which offsets 
some of the biases inherent in cross-sectional and case-control studies and decreases the 
likelihood of reverse causality. Finally, our results remained robust in several sensitivity 
analyses. There are several limitations which also deserve consideration. First, owing to the 
small number of studies (both observational studies and RCTs) for the outcomes of DVT and 
PE, this precluded inadequate assessment of the impact of statin use or therapy on each of 
these endpoints. Second, due to the limited data available for subgroup analyses by statin type 
in both study designs, we were unable to adequately explore whether the effect of statins on 
VTE was a class effect. Third, we pooled estimates from both retrospective and prospective 
cohort designs as well studies that included people from the general population and those at 
high risk of thrombotic events, which could have potentially led to biased estimates. The lack 
of appropriate data precluded the ability to compare the protective effect of statins in 
participants with normal cholesterol levels to those with hypercholesterolemia. However, our 
results of a subgroup analyses by the type of study design and baseline population showed a 
protective effect of statin use on VTE in all groups. Fourth, we were unable to conduct a 
subgroup analysis by type of VTE (provoked versus unprovoked) because of limited data 
provided by eligible studies. Fifth, as with aggregate data, pooled analysis of observational 
cohorts was based on variably adjusted data reported by the eligible studies, thereby 
increasing the possibility of residual confounding. However, all studies adjusted for a 
 comprehensive panel of biological markers and lifestyle characteristics. Sixth, there was 
substantial heterogeneity between observational studies, however possible sources of this 
were systematically explored using stratified and meta-regression analyses. There was 
however no significant evidence of heterogeneity between the contributing trials. Finally, 
given that our trial evidence was mostly based on previously unpublished data (with VTE 
collected as adverse events) contributed by investigators, this could have potentially led to 
biased estimates in our analyses. However, a subgroup analysis comparing pooled estimates 
from previously unpublished data to published data (where VTE was pre-specified as an 
outcome) showed no evidence of effective modification. Given the limitations, the findings 
should be interpreted with caution and intensify the need for detailed future intervention 
studies with VTE pre-specified as primary outcomes and individual patient data meta-analysis 
to help establish the beneficial role of statins in the prevention of VTE. 
 
Conclusions  
Available evidence from observational and intervention studies suggest a beneficial effect of 
statin use on VTE. Therapy with rosuvastatin significantly reduced VTE compared to other 
statins. Further research may be required to validate the beneficial effect of statin therapy on 
VTE and establish if there is a class effect of statins on VTE.

Research in context 
Evidence before this study 
The lipid-lowering properties of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors 
(commonly known as statins) and their effectiveness for the primary and secondary prevention 
of cardiovascular disease (CVD) are well established. Statins are currently only approved for 
lipid lowering in the primary and secondary prevention of CVD. Relevant prospective cohort 
studies conducted in general populations and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reporting on 
associations between statins and venous thromboembolism (VTE) (including deep vein 
thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) were sought from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of 
Science, and Cochrane Library; with particular emphasis on systematic reviews and meta-
analyses of these study designs. We used the search terms “statin”, “hydroxymethylglutaryl-
CoA reductase inhibitors” and “venous thromboembolism”, “deep vein thrombosis”, 
“pulmonary embolism”. Several observational studies were found to have evaluated the 
relationship, but the results were conflicting. A limited number of RCTs demonstrated that 
 statins reduced the occurrence of VTE, but these results were based on few VTE events, which 
suggested a statistical play of chance. Previous reviews on the topic have also reported 
inconsistent results. Statins may have a protective effect on the incidence of VTE, however, 
the overall evidence is uncertain.  
Added value of this study 
This meta-analysis of observational and intervention studies suggest a beneficial effect of 
statin therapy on venous thromboembolism. In observational studies, the protective effect of 
statins on risk of VTE remained consistent when grouped by various study level 
characteristics. In intervention studies, rosuvastatin therapy substantially and significantly 
reduced the risk of venous thromboembolism risk, with no benefit seen with other statins.  
Implications of all the available evidence 
Based on both observational and clinical trial evidence, these findings underscore a potential 
beneficial role of statin therapy on VTE in addition to its established role in CVD prevention. 
The results also suggest that this effect of statins may be attributed to rosuvastatin. Prevention 
of VTE may be another potential indication of statins; however, before any guideline 
recommendations should be made, further research is needed to unequivocably establish this 
potential true protective effect.

Statins and venous thromboembolism: meta-analysis of prospective cohort and randomized 
intervention studies 
 
 
Criteria 
Brief description of how the criteria were handled in the review 
Reporting of background  
 
√ 
Problem definition 
Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and 
pulmonary embolism (PE), is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. 
Statins have been suggested to have a protective effect on VTE outcomes, but the 
evidence is uncertain. 
√ 
Hypothesis statement 
Statin therapy has a protective effect on risk of VTE 
√ 
Description of study outcomes 
Venous thromboembolism, which includes deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary 
embolism  
√ 
Type of exposure  
Statin users 
√ 
Type of study designs used 
Prospective (cohort, case-cohort or “nested case control”) population-based studies and 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
√ 
Study population 
Primary prevention populations and populations with pre-exsting disease 
Reporting of search strategy should include 
 
√ 
Qualifications of searchers 
Setor Kunutsor, PhD; Samuel Seidu, FRCP 
√ 
Search strategy, including time period included 
in the synthesis and keywords 
Time period: from inception of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane 
databases to February 2016.  
The detailed search strategy can be found in Appendix 3. 
√ 
Databases and registries searched 
MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science 
√ 
Search software used, name and version, 
including special features 
Ovid was used to search EMBASE 
Reference Manager used to manage references  
√ 
Use of hand searching 
We searched bibliographies of retrieved papers and review papers  
√ 
List of citations located and those excluded, 
including justifications 
Details of the literature search process are outlined in the flow chart.  The citation list 
for excluded studies is available upon request. 
√ 
Method of addressing articles published in 
languages other than English 
We placed no restrictions on language 
√ 
Method of handling abstracts and unpublished 
studies 
We contacted several investigators for unpublished data and abstracts on the 
associations 
√ 
Description of any contact with authors 
We contacted authors who had conducted univariate or multivariate, but had not 
reported risk estimates 
Reporting of methods should include 
 
√ 
Description of relevance or appropriateness of 
studies assembled for assessing the hypothesis 
to be tested 
Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in the Methods section. 
√ 
Rationale for the selection and coding of data 
Data extracted from each of the studies were relevant to the population characteristics, 
study design, exposure, outcome, and possible effect modifiers of the association. 
√ 
Assessment of confounding 
We assessed confounding by ranking individual studies on the basis of different 
adjustment levels, and performed sub-group analyses to evaluate differences in the 
overall estimates according to levels of adjustment. 
√ 
Assessment of study quality, including 
blinding of quality assessors; stratification or 
regression on possible predictors of study 
results 
For cohort studies, study quality was assessed based on the nine-star Newcastle–
Ottawa Scale using pre-defined criteria namely: population representativeness, 
comparability (adjustment of confounders), ascertainment of outcome. Sensitivity 
analyses by several quality indicators such as study size, duration of follow-up, and 
adjustment factors. For RCTs, we used the Cochrane Collaboration’s risk of bias tool. 
This tool evaluates seven possible sources of bias: random sequence generation, 
allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome 
assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and other bias. 
√ 
Assessment of heterogeneity 
Heterogeneity of the studies was explored with I2 statistic that provides the relative 
amount of variance of the summary effect due to the between-study heterogeneity. 
√ 
Description of statistical methods in sufficient 
detail to be replicated 
Description of methods of meta-analyses, sensitivity analyses, meta-regression and 
assessment of publication bias are detailed in the methods. We performed random 
effects meta-analysis with Stata 14 
√ 
Provision of appropriate tables and graphics 
Table 1; Appendices 4 and 5; Figure 2-5 
Reporting of results should include 
 
√ 
Graph summarizing individual study estimates 
and overall estimate 
Figure 2 and 4 
√ 
Table giving descriptive information for each 
study included 
Table 1; Appendices 4 and 5 
√ 
Results of sensitivity testing 
 
Sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the influence of each individual study by 
omitting one study at a time and calculating a pooled estimate for the remainder of the 
studies 
√ 
Indication of statistical uncertainty of findings 
95% confidence intervals were presented with all summary estimates, I2 values and 
 results of sensitivity analyses 
Reporting of discussion should include 
 
√ 
Quantitative assessment of bias 
Sensitivity analyses indicate heterogeneity in strengths of the association due to most 
common biases in observational studies.  The systematic review is limited in scope, as 
it involves published data. Individual participant data is needed. Limitations have been 
discussed. 
 
√ 
Justification for exclusion 
All studies were excluded based on the pre-defined inclusion criteria in methods 
section. 
√ 
Assessment of quality of included studies 
Brief discussion included in ‘Methods’ section 
Reporting of conclusions should include 
 
√ 
Consideration of alternative explanations for 
observed results 
We discussed that potential unmeasured confounders may have caused residual 
confounding. Additionally, our findings could have been over-estimated somewhat due 
to preferential publication of extreme findings. The variations in the strengths of 
association may also be due to true population differences, or to differences in quality 
of studies. 
√ 
Generalization of the conclusions 
Discussed in the context of the results. 
√ 
Guidelines for future research 
We recommend analyses of individual participant data that would adjust consistently 
for potential confounders 
√ 
Disclosure of funding source 
No separate funding was necessary for the undertaking of this systematic review. 
 
 Appendix 3: MEDLINE literature search strategy 
 
Relevant studies published from inception to May 12, 2016 (date last searched), were identified through electronic searches not 
limited to the English language using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases. Electronic searches were 
supplemented by scanning reference lists of articles identified for all relevant studies (including review articles), and by hand 
searching of relevant journals. The computer-based searches combined search terms related to statins (e.g., statin, 
hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors, atorvastatin, simvastatin) and outcomes (e.g., venous thromboembolism, deep 
vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) in humans, without any language restriction.
