ABSTRACT
Background: Individuals with impaired fat taste (FT) sensitivity
have reduced satiety responses after consuming fatty foods, leading
to increased dietary fat intake. Habitual consumption of dietary fat
may modulate sensitivity to FT, with high consumption decreasing
sensitivity [increasing fatty acid taste threshold (FATT)] and low con-
sumption increasing sensitivity (decreasing FATT). However, some
individuals may be less susceptible to diet-mediated changes in FATT
due to variations in gene expression.
Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the effect of
an 8-wk low-fat or high-fat diet on FATT while maintaining baseline
weight (<2.0 kg variation) to assess heritability and to explore the
effect of genetics on diet-mediated changes in FATT.
Design: A co-twin randomized controlled trial including 44 pairs
(mean ± SD age: 43.7 ± 15.4 y; 34 monozygotic, 10 dizygotic; 33
women, 10 men, 1 gender-discordant) was conducted. Twins within
a pair were randomly allocated to an 8-wk low-fat (<20% of energy
from fat) or high-fat (>35% of energy from fat) diet. FATT was as-
sessed by a 3-alternate forced choice methodology and transformed
to an ordinal scale (FT rank) at baseline and at 4 and 8 wk. Linear
mixed models were fit to assess diet effect on FT rank and diet effect
modification due to zygosity. A variance components model was fit
to calculate baseline heritability.
Results: There was a significant time × diet interaction for FT rank
after the 8-wk trial (P < 0.001), with the same conclusions for the
subset of participants maintaining baseline weight (low-fat; n = 32;
high-fat: n = 35). There was no evidence of zygosity effect modifica-
tion (interaction of time × diet × zygosity: P = 0.892). Heritability
of baseline FT rank was 8%.
Conclusions: There appears to be little to no genetic contribution
on heritability of FATT or diet-mediated changes to FATT. Rather,
environment, specifically dietary fat intake, is the main influencer
of FT sensitivity, regardless of body weight. This trial was reg-
istered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry

INTRODUCTION
Individuals with impaired oral fatty acid sensitivity [fat taste
(FT)] may be more likely to consume greater amounts of fatty
foods, mainly from foods high in saturated and monounsaturated
fat (1–4). Impaired sensitivity to FT is paralleled by impaired
satiety responses to fatty acids in the gastrointestinal tract, which
could lead to increased consumption of dietary fat (5–7). In addi-
tion, impaired sensitivity to FT has been shown to be associated
with increased liking, preference, and choice for fatty foods (5, 8).
Habitual fat intake is responsible for variation in FT, with
increasing dietary fat causing increased fatty acid taste thresh-
old (FATT). Although cross-sectional studies have shown posi-
tive associations between fat intake and FATT (1, 7, 9, 10), in-
tervention studies have shown that modifications to long-term
dietary fat intake mediate change in FATT. Two human 4-wk
(11) and 6-wk (12) dietary fat crossover intervention studies re-
ported decreased FATT after low-fat (LF) dietary intake (11, 12)
and increased FATT after high-fat (HF) dietary intake, albeit
only in lean individuals (11). However, in both studies, partici-
pants who consumed the LF diet lost significant weight over the

intervention period (11, 12), and participants who consumed the
HF diet gained significant weight (11). The authors could not rule
out the possibility that at least part of the reported effect was
due to weight differences, especially considering that in one of
the studies the effect was only evident in lean individuals. How-
ever, body weight does not seem to be associated with FATT, be-
cause a recent meta-analysis of 7 cross-sectional studies found no
relation between FT sensitivity and obesity (13).
Two variants of the CD36 gene have been associated with
FT sensitivity. The A allele of single-nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) rs1761667 for CD36 was associated with reduced FT
sensitivity and increased creaminess perception and liking of
added fats in foods compared with the G allele in multiple
populations (14–18). In addition, the T allele of SNP rs1527483
for CD36 was associated with increased perception of fat content
compared with the C allele in an African American population
(14) but not in a white population (15). However, it is not known
whether SNPs of these genes regulate changes in FT sensitivity
after dietary intervention. Genetic components of a phenotype
can be assessed by comparing monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic
(DZ) twin pairs under the assumption that MZ pairs share 100%
of their genes and DZ pairs share, on average, 50% of their genes
(19, 20).
We present here a study with a co-twin design that was con-
trolled for age and the genetic and common environmental factors
shared by a pair. This randomized controlled trial aimed to assess
the effect of LF (<20% of energy from fat) or HF (>35% of en-
ergy from fat) dietary intakes on FATT while recommending that
participants maintain stable weight over 8 wk. It also aimed to as-
sess the heritability of FATT at baseline and to explore the effect
of genetics on diet-mediated FATT changes by assessing whether
zygosity modifies the diet effect. Secondary aims were to assess
the effect of LF or HF dietary intake on triglyceride (TG) percep-
tion, liking of fatty foods, and intensity ratings on 5 prototypical
tastants.
METHODS
Participants
Twins Research Australia (TRA) invited via mailings 1881
twin pairs (3762 individuals) from the Melbourne metropolitan
area who had not participated in a TRA study in the past 18 mo.
Reminders were sent to 3430 individuals who did not respond
within 3 mo via a combination of mailings, phone calls, and e-
mails. Twins were eligible to participate in the study if they were
aged between 18 and 69 y, were able to attend 3 laboratory ses-
sions in Burwood, Victoria, Australia, and were willing to alter
their diet for a period of 8 wk. Both MZ and DZ twin pairs were
invited to participate. Individuals were excluded from recruit-
ment if they had any dairy allergies and intolerances, illnesses
preventing them from eating foods included in the study, or if
they were pregnant or lactating. Due to the nature of the twin
study design, if 1 individual from a twin pair was excluded or
withdrew from the study, their co-twin was also excluded. In 66
pairs, both twins expressed interest in participating and were then
screened for eligibility. Forty-six twin pairs (92 individuals) aged
between 18 and 68 y were recruited into the study, and co-twins
from each pair were randomly assigned to receive either an LF
or an HF diet. Before recruitment, a block-randomized sequence

weekdays and 1 weekend day at any time during weeks 0–4 and weeks 4–8.
A 24-h dietary recall was not repeated at sessions 2 and 3.
was generated with block sizes of 2. TRA was responsible for
recruitment, and therefore characteristics of the participants were
blinded to the researchers. Participants were allocated to the ran-
domly assigned sequence on the basis of their TRA twin number;
therefore, allocation of participants to diet group was concealed.
Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding of participants was
not feasible. Ethical approval was obtained by the Deakin Univer-
sity Human Research Ethics Committee in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki, and informed written consent was ob-
tained by all participants before participation.
Study outline
Participants attended three 2-h laboratory sessions at the Cen-
tre for Advanced Sensory Science at Deakin University, Bur-
wood. Sessions were conducted 4 wk apart (Figure 1). Tests

were conducted in a temperature- and sound-controlled environ-
ment, with a 15-min break in the middle of their session to pre-
vent fatigue. Participants were asked to avoid eating or drinking
anything but water and to avoid brushing their teeth or using
mouthwash ≤1 h before each tasting session. Tasting sessions
measured for 1) detection threshold to oleic acid (FATT), 2) abil-
ity to rank the amount of fat in food, 3) liking ratings for high-
fat and reduced-fat foods, and 4) intensity ratings to 5 prototypi-
cal tastants (21). Liking and intensity ratings were collected with
the use of the computer software Compusense Cloud as part of
the Compusense Academic Consortium (Compusense, Inc.). An-
thropometric measurements were taken at the beginning of each
session. A 24-h food recall was collected by a nutritionist during
the first session. Between tasting sessions, participants recorded
three 24-h diet records (2 weekdays, 1 weekend day) to determine
dietary compliance.
Dietary intervention
The LF diet was defined as <20% of energy from fats and the
HF diet was defined as >35% of energy from fats. These values
were chosen because they fall outside the Acceptable Macronutri-
ent Distribution Range (AMDR) (20–35%) for fat intake, which
is used as a recommendation in the US, Canadian, and Aus-
tralian dietary guidelines (22). Participants receiving the HF diet
were encouraged to choose foods higher in monounsaturated and
polyunsaturated fats rather than saturated fats in order to main-
tain a healthy diet. A booklet for each diet was created with the
aid of an accredited practicing dietitian, which described the pa-
rameters of each diet; a list of foods that should and should not
be eaten; and some sample recipes that adhere to the diet. Par-
ticipants were given the HF- or LF-diet booklet, their assigned
diet was explained, and they were taught how to interpret a nu-
trition information panel in order to identify which foods were
acceptable for their diet.
They were requested to start the assigned diet the day after
baseline measurement. Because foods were not provided in this
study, food choice was up to the participants. To maximize ad-
herence to the diets, participants were contacted via phone ev-
ery 2 wk and questioned on their dietary habits. If the researcher
felt that participants were not following the diet adequately, they
were provided with suggestions and encouragement to aid in diet
adherence. Participants were also asked a series of questions to
ensure that they did not experience any negative effects from the
diet. These questions included, “Do you feel like you have less
energy since starting the diet,” “Do you feel like your weight has
changed significantly since starting the diet,” and “Is the diet af-
fecting your day-to-day activities?” If the researcher felt that par-
ticipants were suffering from major negative effects due to the
diet (e.g., severe nausea, inability to work), they were asked to
stop the diet and were dropped from the trial.
Completed diet diaries, as described below, were inspected at
the beginning of sessions 2 and 3 and reviewed for adherence to
the assigned diet. Participants were encouraged to maintain their
baseline weight throughout the study. A target of <2 kg of change
in body weight over the trial was set. Participants were asked to
stop eating once they were satiated to prevent overconsumption.
Weight-maintenance guides for each diet, including tips and sug-
gested recipes (e.g., LF guide contained LF, high-energy recipes
to prevent weight loss), were provided to participants at the start
of the trial to help maintain weight. If weight changed by >1 kg
from the baseline and week 4 (session 2), participants were given
further advice on how to maintain their weight for the latter half
of the study.
Dietary assessment
A 24-h dietary recall was used to assess short-term dietary in-
take. A single 3-pass 24-h dietary recall (23) of the day before
session 1 was conducted by a trained nutritionist. Participants
also completed three 24-h diet records between sessions 1 and 2
and between sessions 2 and 3 (Figure 1), because three 24-h diet
records are optimal for estimating energy and macronutrient in-
takes (24). Diet was recorded for 2 weekdays and 1 weekend day,
chosen by the participant. Participants were asked to avoid filling
out diet records on a nonstandard day (e.g., if they attended a wed-
ding reception). They were taught to quantify foods in standard
serving sizes (cups, teaspoons, tablespoons, etc.) with the use of
a food model booklet and asked to weigh their food and drinks
wherever possible. Details such as brand, cooking method, and
food additives (e.g., sugar added to coffee) were included in the
diet records. Food recall and records were analyzed for energy in-
take (kilojoules), total consumption (grams) of protein, fat (total
fat, saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, and polyunsaturated fat),
carbohydrate and alcohol, and percentage of energy from protein,
fat, carbohydrate, and alcohol with the use of the computer soft-
ware FoodWorks (version 8; Xyris).
Anthropometric measurements
Body weight was measured after the removal of shoes, heavy
clothing, and any items in participants’ pockets with the use of
electronic scales (OHAUS NV4101), and height was measured
by using a free-standing stadiometer (Seca). BMI was calculated
as weight (kilograms)/height (meters) squared. Hip and natural
waist (midway between the lowest rib and the iliac crest) circum-
ferences were measured according to WHO guidelines (25).
FATT
Although intensity of the traditional tastes—sweet, sour, salty,
bitter, and perhaps umami—is the most relevant taste dimension
for diet (26), evidence suggests that detection threshold is most
relevant to diet for FT (1–7, 9–13).
Detection threshold to oleic acid (18:1) was measured with the
use of established methods (21). Food-grade oleic acid was ob-
tained from Sigma Aldrich and was stored under nitrogen gas be-
low 4°C. Oleic acid was added at varying concentrations (0.02,
0.06, 1.00, 1.40, 2.00, 2.80, 3.80, 5.00, 6.40, 8.00, 9.80, 12.00,
and 20.00 mM) to long-life fat-free milk (Devondale). All of
the preparations were mixed with 5% (wt:vol) gum arabic (pre-
hydrated FT Powder, TIC Gums; Alchemy Agencies) and 5%
(vol:vol) liquid paraffin (Faulding Remedies) to produce percep-
tually identical textural attributes, including viscosity and lubric-
ity between oleic acid and control samples. To prevent oxidation
of oleic acid, all samples were mixed with 0.01% wt:vol EDTA
(Merck). Samples were homogenized at room temperature for
30 s/100 mL at 12,000 rpm (Average centrifugal force, 3220 ×
g) (Silverston L4RT homogenizer), prepared ≤2 h before testing,
and served at room temperature. Control samples were prepared
in the same way but without added oleic acid. Participants were

asked to rinse their mouths with water before beginning the task
and between sample sets. To prevent confounding nontaste sen-
sory inputs, participants wore nose clips and all of the tests were
conducted under red light.
FATT was determined by using ascending series 3-alternate
forced choice (3-AFC) methodology (21), which is a test to select
a sample among a set of 3 that differs in a known attribute. To
familiarize participants with the taste attribute of oleic acid and to
reduce sensory fatigue, participants were initially provided with
warm-up sets before the 3-AFC test. A warm-up set contained
an oleic acid sample (initially, 3.8 mM) and a control sample.
If participants were unable to perceive a difference between the
control and oleic acid sample during the first warm-up set, then
they were provided with a new warm-up set at 8 mM.
The 3-AFC test began with the highest oleic acid concentration
sample set that could not be differentiated from the control during
warm-up (i.e., the 3-AFC test began with 0.02 mM if the partici-
pant was able to differentiate the 3.8-mM sample from the control
sample). Participants were provided with multiple sample sets
each containing 3 randomly ordered samples per set, 2 controls,
and 1 containing oleic acid. Participants were asked to taste each
sample in the set and identify the sample that matched the taste
quality from the warm-up sets. Correct identification of the oleic
acid sample resulted in the participants repeating the same sam-
ple set. Incorrect identification of the oleic acid sample resulted
in new sample set with a higher concentration of oleic acid. This
continued in an ascending order from the initial concentration to
the highest (20 mM) concentration. The endpoint was defined as
the concentration of oleic acid correctly identified in 3 consec-
utive sample sets of the same concentration, in line with com-
monly established sensory testing procedures (21). The 3-AFC
test was performed in duplicate with participants consuming an
LF plain water cracker (Manassen Foods) between tests to reduce
sensory fatigue. FATT was defined as the mean of the 2 endpoints,
because 2 measures on the same day have shown test-retest re-
liability (12). If participants were unable to correctly identify
the oleic acid sample at the highest concentration (20 mM) for
≥1 of their trials, then they were given a detection threshold of
>20 mM. Of note, due to the range of concentrations of
fatty acid tested (Table 1), the outcome FATT is an interval-
censored variable (i.e., a threshold of 20 mM indicates that the
participant’
s actual threshold is anywhere between 12 and
20 mM). FATT was transformed to an ordinal variable—FT
rank—ranging from 0 to 12, with higher ranks implying lower
sensitivity to FT (Table 1) (1).
TG ranking task
This task was designed to evaluate the participants’ability to
discriminate different amounts of fat content between food sam-
ples (21). Four food samples were made with the use of LF cus-
tard (Parmalat) and varying amounts of canola oil (0%, 2%, 6%,
and 10% oil, wt:wt; Woolworths). All of the samples were stirred
vigorously. Custard samples were presented in a randomized or-
der, and participants were asked to taste and rank them accord-
ing to their fat content. The custard samples were served at room
temperature and prepared ≤2 h before testing. To prevent visual
cues, the test was conducted under red light. TG ranking score
was calculated with the use of the following formula:
(−2 × c1) − (1 × c2) + (1 × c3) + (2 × c4)
(1)
where c1–c4 were the concentrations of the samples assigned by
the participant as having the lowest to the highest fat content (27,
28). The values of the concentrations were −2 for 0%, −1 for 2%,
1 for 6%, and 2 for 10% (wt:wt). Accurately ranking samples in
ascending or descending order are both considered to be correct;
therefore, negative scores were converted to positive values. Final
TG ranking score ranged from 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the
participant was able to correctly discriminate the samples on the
basis of fat content and 0 being unable.
Fatty food liking
Liking of food on the basis of fat content was measured by
rating 7 HF foods and 7 LF counterparts. Participant liking was
measured by rating “liking”on a hedonic labeled magnitude scale
(LMS) with anchors −100 (extremely dislike), 0 (neither like
nor dislike), and 100 (extremely like). Participants were trained
in the use of the hedonic LMS by rating nontaste sensations on
a validated liking questionnaire (29) and were instructed that
the ends of the scale (extremely like) were intended for hedonic
experiences beyond the context of food. Foods were presented
under red light to reduce visual differences between samples.
Savory biscuits (Arnott’
s), peanut butter (Mondelez), hummus
(Black Swan), salad dressing (Goodman Fielder), processed
cheese (Mondelez), cream cheese (Mondelez), and chocolate
mousse (Fonterra) were tested. Foods were always presented in
the order listed above to simulate normal eating behavior. LF and
HF counterparts for each food were presented at the same time,
side-by-side, in a randomized order (left or right side).
HF and LF liking scores were calculated as the mean of the
7 HF food and 7 LF food liking ratings, respectively. The differ-
ences between the HF and LF scores (HF − LF liking score) were
also calculated to control for individual preferences for each food
item.
Intensity ratings to 5 prototypical tastants

and umami solutions at concentrations prepared on the basis

of Webb et al. (26). Solutions were prepared at suprathreshold
concentrations (weak, moderate, and strong) by using sucrose
(Woolworths), sodium chloride (Woolworths), citric acid (Ward
McKenzie), caffeine (Sigma-Aldrich), and monosodium gluta-
mate (Ajinomoto Cooperation), respectively. To prevent con-
founding nontaste sensory inputs, participants wore nose clips
and the test was conducted under red light. Participants tasted
each sample and rated its intensity on an LMS, with anchors of
0 (no taste) to 100 (strongest imaginable taste). Participants were
trained in the use of the LMS following published standard pro-
cedures (26) that involved culturally appropriate remembered or
imagined sensations, such as the coolness of an ice-cold bev-
erage or the sweetness of fairy floss (known as candy floss in
the United Kingdom, or cotton candy in the United States). All
of the solutions were prepared within 5 d of testing, stored at
4°C, and served at room temperature. Participants were presented
all 3 concentrations (weak, moderate, and strong) of 1 taste at
a time in random order. The sequence of the tastants was also
randomized.
Statistical analysis
Numerical variables are reported as mean ± SDs, and categor-
ical data as n (%). Null hypotheses were rejected at P < 0.05.
The effect of the diet on anthropometric measures, dietary
compliance, FT rank, TG ranking score, food liking, and inten-
sity ratings to 5 prototypical tastants was assessed with the use
of linear mixed models including diet (LF and HF), time (base-
line, week 4, and week 8), and time × diet interaction as fixed
effects, with twin pair as a random effect to account for the cor-
relation between co-twins, and participant as the subject with re-
peated measures. The same analysis was repeated for FT rank in
the subset of participants whose weight changed by <2 kg. Post
hoc Sidak’
s P values and CIs are reported.
Further analysis explored the effect of genetics on diet-
mediated changes in FT rank, the only variable that showed a
significant diet effect with the use of the linear mixed model de-
scribed above, further including zygosity (MZ and DZ) and all
double and triple interactions. The effect of diet on FT rank for
MZ and DZ pairs is reported at each time. A greater diet effect in
DZ pairs than in MZ pairs would suggest some degree of genetic
effect that regulates changes in FATT.
To explore the strength of the association ( ˆ
β) between change
in FT rank and overall change in fat intake (grams) and energy
from fat (percentage) over the 8-wk period, a linear mixed model
was used including � FT rank (�, week 8 − baseline) as the
outcome and � fat intake or � energy from fat as a fixed effect,
with twin pair as a random effect. Pearson’
s correlations (r) be-
tween � FT rank and � fat intake are also reported for descriptive
purposes.
Twin concordance for anthropometric measures and FT rank
was estimated through the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)
separately for MZ and DZ twin pairs. ICC was additionally es-
timated controlling for co-twin living status (together or apart).
A Wald test was used to compare MZ and DZ pair ICC esti-
mates (30). Correlation between twin pairs is assumed to be due
to 2 factors, an additive genetic effect (A) and a common envi-
ronmental effect shared by the twin pair (C), with residual vari-
ance in an individual attributed to unique environment effects (E)
(19). These effects can be calculated to provide an estimate of
heritability, which is the degree of variation of a phenotype that
is attributable to additive genetic effects (19). Heritability (h2) of
baseline FT rank was estimated by using a variance components
model including zygosity as a fixed effect and twin pair as a ran-
dom effect. Under the assumption that individual variance can be
modeled as σ 2 = A + C + E, MZ covariance as σ 2MZ = A + C,
and DZ covariance as σ 2DZ = A
2 + C because DZ pairs share 50%
of genes (19, 31, 32), heritability can be estimated as h2 =
A
A+C+E .
Analyses were conducted with the use of SPSS (version 22.0), ex-
cept for twin concordance and heritability analyses, which were
conducted by using STATA (version 15.0; StataCorp).
Sample size calculation
Data from an unpublished nontwin dietary intervention in-
formed the sample size calculations. The computer software
PASS version 15.0 (NCSS) was used to calculate sample size
and power estimates. A sample size of 38 participants/diet group
achieves 82% power to detect a mean difference in FATT of
5.5 mM oleic acid between diet groups when the SD of change
is 8.5 mM oleic acid and the correlation between co-twins is 0.1
(significance level: 0.05; 2-sided, 2-sample paired means anal-
ysis using simulation). Under the same assumptions, a correla-
tion between co-twins of 0.3 or 0.5 achieves a power of 92% and
97%, respectively. In addition, the target sample size (38 pairs)
achieves 85% power for detecting an FATT change of 3 mM oleic
acid between baseline and week 8 in 1 of the groups, assuming
an SD of 6 mM oleic acid (significance level: 0.05; 2-sided, 1-
sample t test). Forty-six pairs were recruited to allow for 15%
attrition.
To assess if 34 MZ and 10 DZ pairs from the final sample had
adequate power to estimate heritability for baseline FT rank, we
performed a post hoc sample size calculation to detect A and C
for the equation h2 =
A
A+C+E (33, 34). The calculations are based
on the proportion of MZ twin pairs in the sample. On the basis of
Visscher (33, 34), the ideal proportion of MZ pairs in a sample is
0.61 for detecting A and 0.06 for detecting C, whereas the propor-
tion of MZ pairs in this study was 0.77. To detect the contribution
of additive genetic effects (A) to a trait with 80% power required
≥16 MZ pairs and 10 DZ pairs, and to detect the contribution of
common environmental effects (C) to a trait with 80% power re-
quired ≥10 MZ pairs and 149 DZ pairs. Because this study was

RESULTS
Sixty-six pairs of twins expressed interest in participating; 46
pairs (70%) were eligible and randomly assigned to the study
(Figure 2). Two twin pairs dropped out of the study after base-
line measurements. One female individual dropped out due to
difficulty adhering to the LF diet, whereas another male individ-
ual receiving the HF diet did not give a reason for dropping out.
Accordingly, their co-twins were excluded from the study. The
trial was completed by 44 twin pairs (35 MZ, 9 DZ; 33 female
pairs, 10 male pairs, 1 gender-discordant pair). There were 34
female participants (77.3%) in the LF-diet group and 33 female

participants (75%) in the HF-diet group. The mean ± SD age for
both groups was 43.7 ± 15.5 y.
Anthropometric measurements
There was a significant time × diet interaction for both weight
and BMI (Table 2). There was a significant decrease in weight
and BMI from baseline to week 4 and from baseline to week 8
in the LF group. There were no significant changes observed in
weight, BMI, waist circumference, or waist-to-hip ratio in the HF
group over the 8 wk. At baseline, the HF group had a significantly
higher waist-to-hip ratio than the LF group. However, this was no
longer significantly different between groups after baseline. No
other between-group differences were observed over the trial.
There were 21 individuals who were not able to maintain base-
line body weight (<2.0 kg variation) over the 8-wk trial. In the
LF-diet group, 11 individuals lost >2 kg and 1 gained >2 kg. In
the HF-diet group, 4 individuals lost >2 kg and 5 gained >2 kg.
FATT
Compared with baseline, in the LF group, mean FT rank sig-
nificantly decreased from 6.8 to 3.6 at week 4 [mean change
(95% CI): −3.2 (−4.3, −2.0); P < 0.001] and to 2.6 at week
8 [mean change (95% CI): −4.2 (−5.4, −3.0); P < 0.001]. In
the HF group, FT rank significantly increased from 6.9 to 8.3 at
week 8 [mean change (95% CI): +1.4 (0.2, 2.6); P = 0.017],
but not at week 4. There was a significant between-group dif-
ference at week 4 [mean difference (95% CI): 4.3 (3.3, 5.4);
P < 0.001] and at week 8 [mean difference (95% CI): 5.7 (4.6,
6.9); P < 0.001] (Figure 3). There was a significant time × diet
interaction (P < 0.001).
The analysis of FT rank was also conducted including only par-
ticipants who maintained body weight (LF: n = 32; HF: n = 35).
The change in FT rank in this subgroup was similar to that in the
full analysis (Supplemental Figure 1).
We explored the association between change in FT rank and
change in total dietary fat intake over the 8 wk. The estimated
association between � FT rank (�, week 8 − baseline) and � fat

means that for every 10 g of fat intake or 1% change in energy
from fat, FT rank changed in the same direction by 0.41 or 0.15,
respectively.
Genetic variation on fatty acid taste threshold
All of the twins in this study were reared together. At the time
of the study, 11 pairs lived at the same address (7 MZ twins,

Mean baseline within-pair difference and ICC estimates, a mea-
sure of co-twin correlation, of each zygosity group are detailed
in Table 3. For the sake of comparison, we include the analy-
sis for anthropometric measures alongside FT rank. As expected,
MZ pairs had a significantly higher ICC than DZ pairs for all
anthropometric measurements. However, the ICC estimated for
FT rank was low for both MZ and DZ pairs, with no differ-
ence between zygosity. In addition, when controlling for co-
twin living status (together or apart), ICC estimates for FT rank
remained similar (MZ ICC: 0.306; DZ ICC: 0.278). Baseline FT
rank heritability was estimated as 8%.

to compare MZ and DZ ICCs. Larger ICCs in MZ pairs than in DZ pairs suggest some genetic contri-

Effect modification by zygosity was explored by comparing
the diet effect on FT rank in MZ pairs and DZ pairs. The greater
the difference of the diet effect on FT rank between DZ pairs and
MZ pairs, the greater degree genetic effects have on regulating
changes to FATT. The effect of the diet was not significantly dif-
ferent between zygosities at any time point (Table 4) and there
was no evidence of time × diet × zygosity interaction (P = 0.892)
(i.e., the pattern of FT rank in each diet group was similar for MZ
and DZ pairs) (Figure 5).
Dietary compliance
Compared with baseline, there was a significant reduction in
energy (kilojoules) intake in the LF group at weeks 4 and 8 and
a significant increase in energy intake in the HF group at week 8
(Table 5). Energy intake was significantly higher in the HF group
than in the LF group at weeks 4 and 8.
Total fat (grams), saturated fat (grams), monounsaturated fat
(grams), polyunsaturated fat (grams), and protein (grams) were
significantly different between diet groups at weeks 4 and 8
(Table 6). The LF group participants significantly reduced their
intake of total fat, saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, and polyun-
saturated fat at weeks 4 and 8, whereas the HF group signifi-
cantly increased their intake of total fat and monounsaturated fat

fat only at week 4.
As expected, the percentage of energy from total fat, saturated
fat, monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, protein, and car-
bohydrate differed significantly between groups at weeks 4 and
8 (Table 6). The LF group significantly decreased intakes of en-
ergy derived from total fat, saturated fat, monounsaturated fat,
and polyunsaturated fat, and significantly increased intakes of en-
ergy derived from protein and carbohydrate at weeks 4 and 8. The
HF group significantly increased intakes of energy derived from
total fat and monounsaturated fat at weeks 4 and 8. The mean per-
centages of energy from total fat in the LF group were 16.7% and
17.2% at weeks 4 and 8, respectively. Similarly, mean percent-
ages of energy from total fat in the HF group were 39.6% and
38.4% at weeks 4 and 8, respectively. Both diet groups complied,
on average, with the required amounts of energy from fat: <20%
and >35%.

6.8 to 2.6 (∼6.1 to 1.8 mM in FATT), indicating a large increase
in FT sensitivity. This is likely due to increased expression of
fatty acid receptors on lingual taste papillae. Rodent studies have
shown that expression of 2 fatty acid taste receptors, CD36 and
free fatty acid receptor 4, decreases after HF exposure (35, 36).
After the HF diet, FT rank increased from 6.9 to 8.4 after 8 wk
(∼6.3 to 8.7 mM in FATT), indicating a decrease in FT sensitiv-
ity. Although the magnitude of the reduction in the HF group was
much lower than the increase seen in the LF group, this is likely
because, in the HF group, total fat intake (grams) increased by
23%, whereas in the LF group there was a 64% reduction in total
fat (grams) consumed. Overall, an increase (or decrease) in en-
ergy from fat by 1% resulted in an increase (or decrease) in FT
rank by 0.15, similar to the cross-sectional analysis of these data
( ˆ
β = 0.11) (1).
Previous intervention studies reported a 1.0% increase in body
weight after increased intake of energy from fat (28–45%) over
4 wk (11) and a 2.3% reduction in body weight after reduced en-
ergy intake from fat (33–16%) over 4 to 6 wk (11, 12). In the
current 8-wk trial, 39.0% of energy from fat led to a 0.1% body
weight increase, and 16.8% of energy from fat led to a 1.8% re-
duction in body weight, which was of lower magnitude than the
previous studies, especially considering the longer duration. Im-
portantly, when we assessed the change in FATT in the subgroup
who maintained body weight, the conclusions were unchanged,
suggesting that weight loss is not a factor in altering FT sensitiv-
ity.
Dietary fat contributed to ∼33% of energy intake in partici-
pants at baseline, similar to the 31–32% energy intake from fat
in the Australian adult population (37). Despite efforts to main-
tain body weight, 11 individuals who consumed the LF diet lost
>2 kg. This shows the difficulty of maintaining weight under an
LF dietary protocol in free-living individuals and was likely ex-
acerbated by increasing satiety response to dietary fat. Diets that
approach the lower AMDR for fat are likely to be useful in West-
ern populations to aid in lowering energy intake and the risk of
obesity. This is in line with evidence that fat intake is linked to
obesity (38) due to being more energy dense than other macronu-
trients.
The heritability of FT rank was relatively low compared with
the heritability of salty (22%) and sour (53%) detection thresh-
olds (39). Garneau et al. (40) reported heritability of 8–19% for
linoleic acid intensity ratings at various concentrations, which is
similar to the current study. However, intensity rating and de-
tection threshold are different taste dimensions and are not di-
rectly comparable. In addition, MZ and DZ ICCs were similar,
suggesting little to no genetic contribution to detection thresh-
old, but rather that familial environment (e.g., diet) is responsi-
ble for the concordance within pairs. In addition, no significant
effect modification of zygosity on diet was observed, indicating
little genetic contribution to diet-mediated change in FATT. It
is important to recognize that this does not suggest that genes
do not influence FATT at all, because previous studies have
found that polymorphisms of CD36 influence FT sensitivity
(14, 17). Rather, the current study suggests that genetic varia-
tion does not make individuals any more or less susceptible to
modifying FATT by diet. We hypothesize that genetic polymor-
phisms have a role in establishing baseline FATT, whereas di-
etary intake modifies it. Although genetic variation has little in-
fluence on FATT, there is evidence of genetic contributions to
fat preference (41), giving evidence to the contrast between
thresholds and hedonics (42).

 FAT INTAKE ON FAT TASTE SENSITIVITY: CO-TWIN RCT
693
The expression of FT receptors in the oral cavity and through-
out the alimentary canal, when triggered by fatty acids, initiates
the satiety cascade (2, 7). Individuals with impaired FT may have
lower expression of these receptors (35, 36), and therefore have
an attenuated satiety response after fatty food consumption (6,
7). In this way, an individual who has lower sensitivity will feel
less full and consume a greater quantity of energy, independent of
the hedonic system. LF dieting may aid in increasing the expres-
sion of FT receptors throughout the alimentary canal (7), lead-
ing to an increased postingestive satiety response to fatty food
and reducing passive overconsumption. However, FT sensitivity
may not be associated with obesity (13). This may be because, al-
though impaired FT sensitivity does influence increased dietary
fat intake, it does not necessarily lead to increased energy intake
in all individuals. Furthermore, factors that influence obesity are
multifaceted and complex. As shown in mice, exposure to obeso-
genic conditions may make FT-impaired individuals more sus-
ceptible to overconsumption of energy and subsequent weight
gain (43).
In other taste modalities, taste thresholds are not associated
with hedonics (42) and this was the same with FT. In the cur-
rent study, there was no significant time × diet interaction for
HF-LF liking score, indicating that FT sensitivity has no influ-
ence on fatty food liking. This is in line with a recent study that
did not observe an association between FT sensitivity and liking
of fatty food (44). There is evidence that reduced dietary fat in-
take decreases the preference for fatty foods (45, 46). It should
be noted that changes in dietary fat intake may affect other sen-
sory acuities. For example, 24 wk of HF dietary intake reduced
olfactory sensation in rodents (47), which may be a contributor
to changed preferences in the previous studies (45, 46). How-
ever, olfactory acuity was not measured in the current study so
we cannot conclude this is the case. Similarly, TG perception
was not affected by diet in the current study. This may have been
because the concentrations of canola oil used were too low to
yield free fatty acid concentrations above the detection thresh-
old. A recently published study reported that average canola oil
detection thresholds were 11.7% ± 1.8% (48), whereas the con-
centrations in the current study ranged from 0% to 10%, which
were likely below detection for most participants. Although there
may be some degree of fatty acid perception in foods containing
TGs due to free fatty acids (48, 49) and lingual lipase activity
(17, 50), this does not have a noticeable impact on preference in
most cases. However, in foods that contain concentrations of free
fatty acid that exceed suprathreshold concentrations (e.g., spoiled
foods, some oils, and nuts), FT may act as a warning system to
deter intake, similar to bitter or sour taste. Therefore, higher sen-
sitivity may reduce liking for these specific foods.
This randomized controlled trial has limitations that should
be noted when interpreting these results. First, because the trial
could not be blinded, we cannot rule out some level of contam-
ination with co-twins mutually discussing their diets. This type
of contamination is expected to bias the estimated diet effect to-
ward the null; therefore, the true effect of the diet on FATT should
be even larger than that reported. Second, although the num-
ber of twin pairs was adequate to assess the dietary intervention
and heritability, the small number of DZ twin pairs recruited is
not powered to detect small differences in effect modification of
zygosity on the diet, and these estimates should be interpreted as
being only indicative of a minimal impact of genetic variation on
FATT. Third, the use of one 24-h dietary recall as a baseline mea-
sure of dietary intake only provided a snapshot of a participant’
s
usual diet. In addition, diet recalls and records are subject to bias
and underreporting in many studies, especially in obese individu-
als, and we cannot rule out bias and underreporting in this study.
Fourth, although there was no effect of diet on intensity ratings
to the 5 prototypical tastants, it is acknowledged that intensity
ratings are not directly comparable to FATT. Finally, although
satiety can be inferred on the basis of findings from Stewart
et al. (7), we did not measure satiety ratings so we cannot con-
clude whether this trial had an influence on satiety.
The current study shows that 8 wk of consumption of an LF
diet increases sensitivity to FT and the same period with an HF
diet attenuates sensitivity, regardless of body weight. There is lit-
tle indication of genetic contribution on FT. Therefore, dietary fat
intake is the most important influencer on FT sensitivity. Diets
that approach the lower AMDR for fat may aid in increasing the
satiety response to fatty food, decrease passive overconsumption,
and subsequently reduce body weight.
