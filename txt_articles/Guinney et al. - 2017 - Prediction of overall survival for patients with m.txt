Summary
Background—Improvements to prognostic models in metastatic castration-resistant prostate 
cancer have the potential to augment clinical trial design and guide treatment strategies. In 
partnership with Project Data Sphere, a not-for-profit initiative allowing data from cancer clinical 
trials to be shared broadly with researchers, we designed an open-data, crowdsourced, DREAM 
(Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods) challenge to not only identify a 
better prognostic model for prediction of survival in patients with metastatic castration-resistant 
prostate cancer but also engage a community of international data scientists to study this disease.
Methods—Data from the comparator arms of four phase 3 clinical trials in first-line metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer were obtained from Project Data Sphere, comprising 476 
patients treated with docetaxel and prednisone from the ASCENT2 trial, 526 patients treated with 
docetaxel, prednisone, and placebo in the MAINSAIL trial, 598 patients treated with docetaxel, 
prednisone or prednisolone, and placebo in the VENICE trial, and 470 patients treated with 
docetaxel and placebo in the ENTHUSE 33 trial. Datasets consisting of more than 150 clinical 
variables were curated centrally, including demographics, laboratory values, medical history, 
lesion sites, and previous treatments. Data from ASCENT2, MAINSAIL, and VENICE were 
released publicly to be used as training data to predict the outcome of interest—namely, overall 
survival. Clinical data were also released for ENTHUSE 33, but data for outcome variables 
(overall survival and event status) were hidden from the challenge participants so that ENTHUSE 
33 could be used for independent validation. Methods were evaluated using the integrated time-
dependent area under the curve (iAUC). The reference model, based on eight clinical variables and 
a penalised Cox proportional-hazards model, was used to compare method performance. Further 
validation was done using data from a fifth trial—ENTHUSE M1—in which 266 patients with 
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were treated with placebo alone.
Findings—50 independent methods were developed to predict overall survival and were 
evaluated through the DREAM challenge. The top performer was based on an ensemble of 
penalised Cox regression models (ePCR), which uniquely identified predictive interaction effects 
with immune biomarkers and markers of hepatic and renal function. Overall, ePCR outperformed 
all other methods (iAUC 0·791; Bayes factor >5) and surpassed the reference model (iAUC 0·743; 
Bayes factor >20). Both the ePCR model and reference models stratified patients in the 
ENTHUSE 33 trial into high-risk and low-risk groups with significantly different overall survival 
(ePCR: hazard ratio 3·32, 95% CI 2·39–4·62, p<0·0001; reference model: 2·56, 1·85–3·53, 
p<0·0001). The new model was validated further on the ENTHUSE M1 cohort with similarly high 
performance (iAUC 0·768). Meta-analysis across all methods confirmed previously identified 
predictive clinical variables and revealed aspartate aminotransferase as an important, albeit 
previously under-reported, prognostic biomarker.

 Interpretation—Novel prognostic factors were delineated, and the assessment of 50 methods 
developed by independent international teams establishes a benchmark for development of 
methods in the future. The results of this effort show that data-sharing, when combined with a 
crowdsourced challenge, is a robust and powerful framework to develop new prognostic models in 
advanced prostate cancer.

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in high-income countries and ranks 
third in terms of mortality after lung cancer and colorectal cancer.1 Of more than two million 
men diagnosed with prostate cancer in the USA over the past 10 years, roughly 10% 
presented with metastatic disease. For these men, the mainstay of treatment is androgen 
deprivation therapy, with a high proportion of response. However, responses are not durable, 
and nearly all tumours eventually progress to the lethal metastatic castration-resistant state. 
Although substantial improvements in outcome for men with metastatic castration-resistant 
prostate cancer have been achieved after approval of next-generation hormonal agents, an 
immunotherapeutic drug, a radiopharmaceutical agent, and a cytotoxic drug,2–10 how best to 
deploy these treatments has not been ascertained. Elucidation of variables associated with 
patients’ outcomes independent of treatment will facilitate the design of future trials by 
homogenising risk, thus enabling clinical trial questions to be answered more rapidly 
because smaller sample sizes will be needed.
Prognostic models in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer have been described11–13 
using baseline variables from independent cohort studies. A 2014 prognostic model for 
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer14 included eight clinical factors predictive of 
overall survival: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status; disease 
site; use of opioid analgesics; lactate dehydrogenase; albumin; haemoglobin; prostate-
specific antigen; and alkaline phosphatase. Can innovative models with improved 
performance be developed through a systematic search using data-driven approaches while 
providing insights into biological aspects of the disease that affect patients’ outcomes? An 
example of a novel clinical factor that is underexplored in contemporary prognostic model 
development is interaction effects between clinical variables, even though interactions 
between genetic variants are used widely and known to improve genetic-based risk 
prediction and patients’ stratification.15,16
Here, we present results from the prostate cancer DREAM (Dialogue for Reverse 
Engineering Assessments and Methods) challenge—an open-data, crowdsourced challenge 
in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. A major contribution to this effort was 
removal of privacy and legal barriers associated with open access to phase 3 clinical trial 
data17 by Project Data Sphere—a not-for-profit initiative of the CEO Roundtable on 
Cancer’s Life Sciences Consortium that broadly shares oncology clinical trial data with 
researchers. The challenge was designed to accomplish two goals. First, we aimed to 
leverage open clinical trial data, enabling a community-based approach to identify the best-
performing prognostic model in a rigorous and unbiased manner. Second, participating

 teams aimed to develop predictive models to both validate previously characterised 
predictive clinical variables and discover new prognostic features. Consistent with the 
mission of DREAM, all challenge data, results, and method descriptions from participating 
teams are available publicly through the open-access Synapse platform.
Methods
Trial selection
In April 2014, the DREAM challenge organising team reviewed all existing and incoming 
prostate cancer trial datasets (comparator arm only) in Project Data Sphere and selected four 
trials, which were the source of training and validation datasets for the DREAM challenge—
ASCENT2,18 MAINSAIL,19 VENICE,20 and ENTHUSE 33.21 All four trials were 
randomised phase 3 clinical trials in which the comparator arm consisted of a docetaxel 
regimen and overall survival was the primary endpoint. These four trials also had similar 
inclusion and exclusion criteria: eligible patients were aged 18 years and older, had 
progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, were chemotherapy-naive, and 
had an ECOG performance status of 0–2. Further details of inclusion and exclusion criteria 
for each trial are provided in the appendix (p 3). The patient-level trial datasets were 
deidentified by data providers and made available for the DREAM challenge through Project 
Data Sphere. No institutional review board approval was needed to access data.
Patient populations
We compiled training datasets from the comparator arms of ASCENT2, MAINSAIL, and 
VENICE. ASCENT218 is a randomised open-label study assessing DN-101 in combination 
with docetaxel. Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were randomly 
assigned either docetaxel and prednisone (comparator arm) or docetaxel and DN-101, 
stratified by geographical region and ECOG performance status. MAINSAIL19 is a 
randomised double-blind study to assess efficacy and safety of docetaxel and prednisone 
with or without lenalidomide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. 
Participants were randomly assigned to either docetaxel, prednisone, and placebo 
(comparator arm) or lenalidomide, docetaxel, and prednisone. Stratification of patients in 
MAINSAIL was done based on ECOG performance status (0–1 vs 2), geographical region 
(USA and Canada vs Europe and Australia vs rest of world), and type of disease progression 
after hormonal treatment (rising prostate-specific antigen only vs tumour progression). 
VENICE20 is a randomised double-blind study comparing the efficacy and safety of 
aflibercept versus placebo, in which patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate 
cancer were randomly assigned either docetaxel, prednisone or prednisolone, and placebo 
(comparator arm) or docetaxel, prednisone or prednisolone, and aflibercept. Participants 
were stratified by baseline ECOG performance status (0–1 vs 2). The validation dataset was 
from the ENTHUSE 33 trial,21 a double-blind study in which patients with metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer were randomly allocated (1:1) either docetaxel and 
placebo (comparator arm) or docetaxel with zibotentan, stratified by centre.

 Data curation
The original datasets from Project Data Sphere contained patient-level raw tables that 
conformed to either Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) standards or company-specific 
clinical database standards. To optimise use of these data for the DREAM challenge, we 
compiled the four sets of trial data into a set of five standardised raw event-level tables, 
meaning all four clinical trials were combined into the same tables based on laboratory 
values, medical history, lesion sites, previous treatments, and vital signs. Including patients’ 
demographic information, these tables presented most measurements made for the patient in 
that category. To summarise these data on a per-patient level, we created a core table, 
distilling the raw event-level tables and patients’ demographics into 129 clinically defined 
baseline and outcome variables. Full details of the data curation process are provided in the 
appendix (pp 3, 4).
We supplied participating teams with the full set of baseline and raw variables from the core 
and raw event-level tables. We encouraged challenge participants to derive additional 
baseline clinical variables from the five standardised raw event-level tables for modeling. We 
also provided teams with outcome variables for the ASCENT2, MAINSAIL, and VENICE 
trials, but we did not release the outcome variables for the ENTHUSE 33 trial because they 
would serve to independently evaluate the performance of models. The primary endpoint 
used for model development was overall survival, defined as the time from date of 
randomisation to the date of death from any cause.
We did principal component analysis to investigate systematic similarities or differences 
between the four clinical trials, using either all available variables or binary variables only. 
We visualised the principal component analysis by plotting the first principal component 
against the second principal component for all patients.
Further validation
After the DREAM challenge was completed using data from ENTHUSE 33 for method 
evaluation, we further validated the top-performing and reference models with data from a 
fifth trial, ENTHUSE M1,22 to assess whether the top-performing model could be used to 
stratify risk for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who received 
placebo alone and no docetaxel. ENTHUSE M1 is a randomised double-blind study to 
assess the efficacy and safety of 10 mg zibotentan in patients with metastatic castration-
resistant prostate cancer (specifically, bone metastasis). By contrast with ENTHUSE 33, the 
ENTHUSE M1 trial included a comparator arm of placebo alone. Patients were randomly 
allocated (1:1) either zibotentan or placebo and were stratified by centre. The inclusion and 
exclusion criteria were similar to those used for ENTHUSE 33 except that patients in 
ENTHUSE M1 were pain free or mildly symptomatic. To be consistent for validation, 
curation of ENTHUSE M1 data followed the same process as was done for ASCENT2, 
MAINSAIL, VENICE, and ENTHUSE 33, resulting in a core table and five raw event-level 
tables.

 Challenge procedures
The DREAM challenge was hosted and fully managed on Synapse, a cloud-based platform 
for collaborative scientific data analysis, through which all model predictions were 
submitted. The challenge was run in two phases (appendix pp 4, 17). First, teams were 
allowed to train and test their models in an open testing leaderboard phase. Second, teams 
were permitted one last submission to the final scoring phase, after which teams were scored 
and ranked. Accordingly, we split data from ENTHUSE 33 into two separate sets, consisting 
of 157 patients and 313 patients. The smaller dataset was used for the open testing phase and 
the larger dataset was used for the final scoring phase. Moreover, all reported performance 
values for the evaluated methods and all comparisons between the top-performing model and 
reference model used the larger set of data from the ENTHUSE 33 trial. The reference 
prognostic model for prediction of overall survival was a penalised Cox proportional-
hazards model using the adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) 
penalty.14
For method evaluation, we used the integrated AUC (iAUC)23 calculated from 6–30 months 
as our primary scoring metric. For robust determination of the best performing team or 
teams, we used Bayes factor analysis and randomisation test based on iAUC (appendix pp 4, 
5). For each team, we calculated the Bayes factor to directly compare the performance of a 
model with the reference model; coefficients for the reference model were obtained from 
reported hazard ratios (HRs).14 Furthermore, we evaluated model predictions by plotting 
Kaplan-Meier curves, after dichotomising patients for each team separately by median risk 
score. We used the log-rank test to compare the two groups using the coxph function in the 
survival R package. We calculated CIs by inverting the Wald test statistic. The risk scores 
generated by each model have their own dynamic range; thus, we used the rankings of 
patients for scoring by iAUC or Kaplan-Meier analysis. Accordingly, we selected the 
median risk score as a means to compare different methods in a fair manner. A major goal of 
the challenge was to encourage teams to develop and test novel methods outside of standard 
survival analysis approaches; thus, risk score predictions across all teams varied in their 
range and distribution. A standard threshold could not be established fairly for all teams; 
therefore, we relied on rank-based scoring methods, including the iAUC, and stratifying risk 
scores based on the median. We also calculated other statistics, including median survival 
and 1-year and 2-year survival for the dichotomised high-risk and low-risk groups. We did 
hierarchical clustering on rank-normalised risk score predictions from all models in the 
challenge, using Euclidean distance and average linkage.
We used the ENTHUSE 33 dataset to assess the calibration of the top-performing model. We 
plotted the predicted survival probability based on the top-performing model against the 
observed survival proportions at 18, 24, 30, and 36 months. For each time cutoff, we divided 
the population into seven equally spaced categories based on the ranked predicted risk by the 
top-performing model. We then calculated the true survival proportion within each category 
and plotted it as a point estimate and 95% CI. A 45° line on the plots indicated perfect 
calibration.
The organisers of the DREAM challenge used SAS version 9.3 for data curation and R 
version 3.2.4 for statistical analyses. R packages used for challenge evaluation included

 survival version 2.38–3, ROCR version 1.0–7, timeROC version 0.3, and Bolstad2 version 
1.0–28. The top-performing model also used glmnet version 2.0–5 and hamlet version 
0.9.4-2.
Clinical trial data used in the prostate cancer DREAM challenge can be accessed online.24 
Write-ups, model code, and predictions for all teams are reported in the appendix (pp 7, 8). 
Challenge documentation, including a detailed description of its design, overall results, 
scoring scripts, and the clinical trials data dictionary can be accessed via the Synapse 
platform.
Role of the funding source
Project Data Sphere had a collaborative role in design and logistics of the DREAM 
challenge but played no part in data collection, data analysis, and data interpretation or in the 
writing of this report. Sanofi US Services provided an in-kind contribution of human 
resources for curation of the raw datasets for the DREAM challenge and for clinical and 
scientific support of the challenge organisation, at the request of Project Data Sphere. Sanofi 
personnel participated in design of the DREAM challenge, in data analysis and data 
interpretation, and in writing of the report, but had no role in data collection. Raw clinical 
trial datasets for ASCENT2, MAINSAIL, and VENICE were available on the Project Data 
Sphere platform and were accessible by all registered users of Project Data Sphere, 
including all DREAM challenge participants and organisers, throughout the challenge. JG, 
TW, KKW, BMB, LS, KA, YX, FLZ, and JCC had access to raw data for ENTHUSE 33. 
JG, TW, KKW, LS, KA, FLZ, and JCC had access to raw data for ENTHUSE M1, during 
the post-challenge analysis. Data for ENTHUSE 33 and ENTHUSE M1 have been made 
freely accessible through the Project Data Sphere platform with publication of this report. 
The corresponding author had full access to all data in the study and had final responsibility 
for the decision to submit for publication.
Results
The overall DREAM challenge design is shown in figure 1, with full details in the appendix 
(p 4). The table presents baseline characteristics of patients in the five clinical trials included 
in this analysis. The training dataset included: 476 individuals from ASCENT2; 526 
participants in MAINSAIL; and 598 men from VENICE. The validation dataset consisted of 
470 patients from the ENTHUSE 33 trial; 528 men were initially enrolled to that trial but, 
because of regulatory restrictions in one country, data for 58 individuals were not made 
public through the challenge. The second validation dataset comprised 266 patients from 
ENTHUSE M1. Because of the same regulation restriction mentioned for ENTHUSE 33, 
some data were not provided to Project Data Sphere.
129 clinical baseline variables were measured for laboratory values, lesion site, previous 
medicines, medical history, and vital signs. When combined and assessed, the clinical 
variables for each trial were similar (appendix p 13), although when binary variables—
mainly representing lesion sites—were judged separately, differences in clinical trials were 
recorded (appendix p 13). ASCENT2 had a lower frequency of patients with visceral 
metastases (1·1% liver and 1·7% lung) compared with individuals in the other three trials

 (10–14% liver, 11–15% lung). By contrast, the proportion of patients with bone metastases 
was high across the four trials (72–100%). Median follow-up differed among the four 
studies: 11·7 months (IQR 8·6–15·8) in ASCENT2; 9·2 months (6·4–13·1) in MAINSAIL; 
21·1 months (12·9–29·6) in VENICE; and 15·3 months (10·9–20·8) in ENTHUSE 33. Risk 
profiles for each of the trials—specifically, mortality—were similar among the four trials 
(proportionality of hazards, p>0·5; appendix p 14). The proportion of patients who died in 
each trial was 138 (29%) of 476 in ASCENT2, 92 (17%) of 526 in MAINSAIL, 433 (72%) 
of 598 in VENICE, and 255 (54%) of 470 in ENTHUSE 33.
50 international teams—comprising 163 individuals—submitted predictions from their 
models to the challenge; with the reference model, the total number of models is 51. The 
distribution of all team scores by iAUC is shown in the appendix (p 15). The top-performing 
model was developed by a collaborative team from the Institute for Molecular Medicine 
Finland and the University of Turku. The method was based on an ensemble of penalised 
Cox regression (ePCR) models. The ePCR model extended beyond the LASSO-based 
reference model by using an elastic net to select additional correlated groups of clinical 
variables and their interactions, modelled as interaction terms (panel). The risk predictions 
from the trial-specific ensemble components were rank-averaged to produce the final 
ensemble risk score predictions and to avoid trial-specific variation.
The top-scoring ePCR model reported an iAUC of 0·791 and outscored all other teams, with 
a Bayes factor greater than 5, surpassing the threshold that defines significantly different 
performances (Bayes factor >3). The reference model achieved an iAUC of 0·743, with a 
significant difference in scores between the ePCR model and the reference model (Bayes 
factor >20). With a time-dependent AUC metric, the ePCR model outperformed the 
reference model at every timepoint, with the biggest difference in performance at later 
timepoints between 18 and 30 months (figure 2A). A median split of patients into low-risk 
and high-risk groups for the ePCR model resulted in a low-risk group comprising 156 
patients and 56 deaths (median follow-up 27·6 months [IQR 18·2–31·9]) and a high-risk 
group containing 157 patients and 107 deaths (15·1 [8·5–20·1]). Similarly for the reference 
group, a low-risk group including 156 patients and 59 deaths (median follow-up 26·5 months 
[IQR 17·2–31·9]) and a high-risk group with 157 patients and 104 deaths (15·6 [8·6–21·8]) 
were generated. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that low-risk and high-risk groups had 
significantly different overall survival in each model (ePCR, HR 3·32, 95% CI 2·39–4·62, 
p<0·0001; reference, 2·56, 1·85–3·53, p<0·0001; figure 2B, 2C). A full comparison is 
provided in the appendix (p 9). We assessed the calibration of the ePCR model by 
comparing predicted probabilities versus actual probabilities at multiple timepoints 
(appendix p 16).
Figure 3 shows a network visualisation of the significant groups of variables identified in the 
ePCR model and their predictive relations, based on the importance of the model covariates 
and their interactions. Although many of the variables used in the reference model were also 
included in the ePCR model, aspartate aminotransferase was identified as a new important 
predictor. We also recorded a number of factors that were included as interaction terms, and 
of particular note were those reflecting the immunological or renal function of the patient.

 Prostate-specific antigen was an independent but weak prognostic factor that interacted 
strongly with lactate dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferase.
In addition to identifying the top-performing model, the challenge also tested the other 
independent models, with 30 of 50 outperforming the reference model (Bayes factor >3; 
appendix p 15). We performed hierarchical clustering of risk scores from the 51 models to 
identify three distinct risk groups (figure 4A), with 98 patients (77 deaths) in group A (high 
risk), 131 patients (61 deaths) in group B (moderate risk), and 84 patients (25 deaths) in 
group C (low risk). Differences in overall survival among these three groups were significant 
(log-rank p<0·0001), with median overall survival of 12·9 months (95% CI 10·7–15·3) for 
group A, 20·8 months (18·3–25·6) for group B, and 27·7 months (26·6–not available) for 
group C (figure 4B).
40 of 50 teams provided a list of common clinical factors that were incorporated into their 
final models; the frequencies with which a feature was reported as being important or 
significant in a team’s model are summarised in the appendix (p 18). The results not only 
confirmed the variables identified previously in the reference model but also highlighted 
several factors that were not. Of note, aspartate aminotransferase was included in more than 
half the team models. Other novel variables that were included in at least 15% of the models 
are total white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count, red blood cell count, region of the 
world, body-mass index, and creatinine.
Application of the ePCR and reference models to the ENTHUSE M1 dataset showed model 
performances comparable with the primary challenge, with an iAUC of 0·768 for the ePCR 
model and 0·727 for the reference model (figure 5A). A median split of risk scores in the 
ePCR model led to a high-risk group of 133 patients, of which 45 were right-censored, and a 
low-risk group of 133 patients, of which 88 were right-censored. Kaplan-Meier analysis of 
the ENTHUSE M1 data showed significant separation of the high-risk and low-risk 
predicted patients (p<0·0001), with median survival of 15·8 months (95% CI 12·8–18·7) for 
high-risk patients and 27·1 months (23·2–not available) for low-risk patients (figure 5B).
Discussion
The prostate cancer DREAM challenge resulted in one prognostic model to predict overall 
survival significantly outperforming all other methods, including a reference model reported 
by Halabi and colleagues,14 and led to a network perspective of predictive biological 
variables and their interactions. The results from the top-performing team’s model pointed to 
important interaction effects with immune biomarkers and markers of hepatic function 
(potentially reflected in the increased amounts of aspartate aminotransferase) and renal 
function. The network visualisation of the prediction model suggests a complex relation and 
dependency structure among many of the predictive clinical variables. Many of these noted 
interactions, although not significant as independent variables, might be important

 interaction, these findings shed light on the complex and interwoven nature of prognostic 
factors on patients’ survival.
Open-data, crowdsourced, scientific challenges have been highly effective at drawing 
together large cross-disciplinary teams of experts to solve complex problems.25–30 To our 
knowledge, this DREAM challenge represented the first public collaborative competition31 
to use open-access registration trial datasets in cancer with the intention of improving 
outcome predictions. In total, 163 individuals comprising 50 teams participated in the 
challenge, applying state-of-the-art machine learning and statistical modelling methods. The 
contribution of five clinical trial datasets from industry and academic institutions to Project 
Data Sphere, and their subsequent use in an open challenge, enabled the advancement of 
prognostic models in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer that up to now was not 
possible. Modellers had access to several independent clinical trial cohorts with subtle 
differences in eligibility that increased the diversity (heterogeneity) of the total patient 
population considered for model development. Access was also provided to data for 150 
independent and standardised variables over the trials; by contrast, only 22 variables were 
considered by the reference model.14 The challenge resulted in creative data-mining 
approaches that used standardised raw event-level tables, which are rarely leveraged for 
prognostic model development, and enabled innovative clinical features to be derived for 
modelling. Several teams—including the top-performing team—made use of these event-
level tables. Finally, evaluation of the 50 methods (validated by an independent and neutral 
party) provided the most comprehensive assessment of prognostic models in metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer. These results are both a benchmark for future prognostic 
model development and a rich source of information that can be mined for additional 
insights into both patients’ stratification and the robustness of clinical predictive factors.
This study has shown the benefits of open data access at a time when clinicians, researchers, 
and the public are advocating for improved platforms and policies that encourage sharing of 
clinical trial data.32,33 Project Data Sphere has overcome major barriers to data sharing with 
support of data providers, to allow broad access to cancer clinical trial data. To researchers 
who are interested in leveraging open-access cancer trial data, this study represents a novel 
research approach that encompassed scientific rigor and a deep understanding of clinical 
data through effective collaboration of multidisciplinary teams of experts. The top-
performing ePCR model was free of any a-priori clinical assumptions, with the exception of 
exclusion of non-relevant variables in early data curation. The data-driven modelling process 
identified automatically the best combination of predictors through cross-validation. 
Furthermore, the ePCR modelling process was fully agnostic to the variables used in the 
previous reference model; however, many of the same predictors were identified, in addition 
to novel ones. Such data-driven, unbiased modelling approaches can mine effectively the 
predictive variables and their combinations from large-scale and open clinical trial data.
The trials used here represent the standard of care at the time when the trials were done, 
which is a limitation of this study. Since 2010, several treatments have become available, for 
use both before and after first-line chemotherapy, and new trials have changed the way 
clinicians approach this disease.34 Abiraterone and enzalutamide—both approved for first-
line treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer—are not included within the

 scope of this challenge because of a limitation of control arm data; both COU-AA-3025 and 
PREVAIL10 have placebo or prednisone controls, and comparative trials using these agents 
as control have not been done. Accordingly, trial sponsors should be encouraged to 
contribute data from the experimental arm (particularly for approved drugs) to an active and 
engaged research community. Although sponsors are concerned that virtual comparisons 
might be made between treatments in experimental arms of different trials, there is far more 
benefit in leveraging these data to validate prognostic factors and models and to investigate 
intermediate clinical endpoints predictive of survival.
The DREAM challenge described here has shown that there is opportunity to further 
optimise prognostic models in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer using baseline 
clinical variables. For substantial advances beyond the work presented here, clinical trial 
data must be made available that reflects current advancements in treatment paradigms, 
including new data-capture techniques such as genomics, immunogenomics, and 
metabolomics that might more accurately describe the malignant state of the tumour and its 
microenvironment. Vital to either of these will be the need to share patient-level oncology 
data with the research community for the development of the next generation of prognostic 
and predictive models in cancer.

 Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed between January, 2012, and July, 2015, with the terms “prognosis”, 
“overall survival”, “mCRPC”, and “docetaxel”. Our search yielded a 2014 study in which 
an updated prognostic model was described for metastatic castration-resistant prostate 
cancer that had been developed from the CALGB-90401 study (a randomised, double-
blind, phase 3 clinical trial) and validated with data from the phase 3 ENTHUSE 33 trial. 
The study focused on a subset of clinical variables using datasets that were not in the 
public domain. Leveraging the wealth of data already generated from clinical trials is 
challenging on several fronts, but is complicated in particular by data access.
Added value of this study
Project Data Sphere is an independent not-for-profit initiative that aims to provide open 
access to historical patient-level data. The prostate cancer DREAM (Dialogue for 
Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods) challenge is an open-data, crowdsourced 
competition to develop and assess prognostic models in metastatic castration-resistant 
prostate cancer. Using data from the comparator arms of four phase 3 clinical trials of 
chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, 50 
independent teams—a diverse group of experts including biostatisticians, computer 
scientists, and clinical experts—developed prognostic models for the DREAM challenge, 
representing, to the best of our knowledge, the most comprehensive set of benchmarked 
models to date. The best-performing model was based on an ensemble of penalised Cox 
regression models that judged the prognostic value of interactions between predictor 
covariates and substantially outperformed the 2014 model. Strong support was provided 
for previously identified prognostic variables in the 50 models, and additional important 
variables were identified along with novel interactions between covariates. Data are 
available publicly through the Project Data Sphere initiative, and all method predictions 
and code are available for download through the Sage Bionetworks Synapse platform.
Implications of all the available evidence
Clinical trial data-sharing is both feasible and useful, and the DREAM challenge is an 
appropriate vehicle on which to build and rigorously assess prognostic or predictive 
models quickly, openly, and robustly. We established a new prognostic benchmark in 
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, with applications in trial design and 
guidance for clinicians and patients. Robust and accurate prognostic predictors can be 
used to homogenise risk in clinical trials of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer 
and enable smaller trials for assessment of treatment effects.

 Panel: Top-performing model construction in training datasets
The top-performing model was based on an ensemble of penalised Cox regression 
models (ePCR), as shown in the equation. For each trial-specific ensemble component, 
the model estimation procedure identified an optimum penalisation parameter (λ), which 
controls for the number of non-zero coefficients in the prediction model, and 
simultaneously the regularisation parameter (α) with respect to the objective function:
Here, x are the predictors (clinical variables or their pairwise interactions), β are the 
model coefficients subjected to the absolute error and squared error penalisations (|β| and 
β2, respectively), p is the number of predictors, n is the number of observations, j(i) is the 
index of the observation event at time Ti, and Ri is the set of indices j for which yj≥Ti 
(patients at risk at time Ti), where yj is the observed death or right-censoring time. The 
set of indices Ri is redefined for each patient i using the above risk criterion incorporating 
y and T. With suitable regularisation, the penalised regression identifies an optimum 
balance between the model fit and top predictors, effectively generalising the Cox model 
for future predictions. To reduce the risk of overfitting and to avoid randomness bias in 
the binning, the final ensemble models were optimised using ten-fold cross-validation of 
the iAUC, averaged over multiple cross-validation runs. By modelling each trial 
individually as a separate ensemble component with different optima in the equation, we 
are able to account effectively for trial-specific variation (appendix p 12). The optimum 
parameters (penalisation λ and norm α) for each trial were first identified using cross-
validation, after which the model coefficients (β) are estimated by optimising the above 
objective function.
Data processing entailed missing value imputation with a penalised Gaussian regression 
variant of the equation, with cross-validation when variables with non-missing values 
were used as predictors. Variables with missing values were inferred by training an 
optimum model with the non-missing variables and then imputing the missing values. 
Laboratory values were modelled as continuous variables. Data curation entailed 
unsupervised explorative analyses (appendix pp 5, 6, 12). ASCENT2 trial data were used 
in the imputation and unsupervised learning phases but were omitted from construction 
of the final supervised ensemble predictor, which was based on three components: 
MAINSAIL alone, VENICE alone, and their combination (appendix p 12). The final 
ensemble prediction was done by averaging over the ranks of the component-predicted 
risks for the ENTHUSE 33 dataset (appendix p 12). Averaging of risk score ranks was 
selected to be more robust to trial-specific variation and potential outliers. Full details of 
the model and its network visualisation are in the appendix (pp 5, 6, 12) with a list of 
chosen predictors (appendix pp 10, 11).

 Figure 1. Study design
Data were acquired from Project Data Sphere and curated centrally by the organising team 
to provide a harmonised dataset across the four studies. Three studies were provided as 
training data (ASCENT2, MAINSAIL, and VENICE) and the fourth (ENTHUSE 33) was 
the validation dataset. Teams submitted risk scores for ENTHUSE 33, then their predictions 
were scored and ranked using an integrated time-dependent area under the curve (AUC) 
metric.
