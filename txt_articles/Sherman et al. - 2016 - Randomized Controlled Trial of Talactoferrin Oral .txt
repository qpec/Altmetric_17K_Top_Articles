Abstract
Objective—To evaluate safety and explore efficacy of recombinant human lactoferrin 
(talactoferrin, TLf) to reduce infection.
Study design—We conducted a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial in 6 0 infants 
with birth weights of 750 to 1500 grams. Each infant received enteral TLf or placebo on day 1 
through 28 days of life; TLf dose was 150 mg/kg/12 hour. Primary outcomes were bacteremia, 
pneumonia, urinary tract infection, meningitis and necrotizing enterocolitis. Secondary outcomes 
were sepsis syndrome and suspected NEC. We recorded clinical, laboratory and radiologic 
findings, diseases, and adverse events in a database used for statistical analyses.
Results—Infants in the two groups had similar demographics. We attributed no enteral or organ-
specific adverse events to TLf. There were two deaths in the group with TLf (posterior fossa 
hemorrhage and post-discharge sudden infant death), and one infant given placebo died of 
necrotizing enterocolitis. Hospital-acquired infections in the group with Tlf were 50% of that 
observed in infants fed placebo (p<0.04), including fewer blood or line infections, urinary tract 
infections, and pneumonia. Fourteen infants treated with TLf-weighing <1 kg at birth weight had 
no Gram-negative infections versus three of 14 infants given placebo. Non-infectious outcomes

 did not differ statistically in the two arms. No differences in growth or neurodevelopment occurred 
among infants treated with TLf and placebo during a one-year, post-hospitalization period.

Keywords
lactoferrin; safety; hospital-acquired infections; VLBW infants
Hospital-acquired infections represent the majority of diseases affecting preterm infants in 
NICUs.1 Because hospital-acquired infections increase the hospital stay and escalate 
significantly the cost of care, the American Academy of Pediatrics called for strategies to 
reduce hospital-acquired infections in NICUs.2,3 Among hospital-acquired infections, 
bacteria resistant to broad-spectrum antibiotics cause >50% of patient-associated disease,4 
which has led to an emphasis on antibiotic stewardship.
Modified health care practices have reduced hospital-acquired infections in extremely 
preterm infants,2,3 but do not address the underlying immaturity of the mucosal and systemic 
immune systems.5 Maternal milk is known to reduce the occurrence of bacteremia and 
necrotizing enterocolitis.6,7 Biomolecules in human milk are proposed to synchronously 
modify the intestinal microbiome and nascent gut and systemic immunity, thereby reducing 
susceptibility to infection.5,8 Extremely preterm infants (<1 kg birth weight) have the 
highest vulnerability to infection because maternal colostrum is either limited immediately 
after birth or intestinal dysmotility hinders full enteral feedings for days to weeks.
Human milk proteins enhance development of intestinal epithelia, facilitate a healthy 
intestinal microflora, establish host defenses, and heighten mucosal defenses. We propose 
that the human milk protein lactoferrin partly explains these beneficial effects.9,10 
Commercial recombinant human lactoferrin became available 20 years ago.11 We found 
feeding TLf prophylactically to neonatal rats prevented morbidity and mortality caused by 
enteroinvasive Escherichia coli.12 Our research then became focused on enteral lactoferrin 
deficiency that occurs in the early life of immature infants. We hypothesized that feeding 
TLf would be safe, and conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess its safety and 
efficacy in VLBW infants.
METHODS
This double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial fed TLf or placebo to infants with 
birth weights between 750 and 1500 grams within 24 hours of birth and through 28 days of 
life (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00854633). We excluded infants if they had a major congenital 
malformation, chromosomal abnormality, documented prenatal or intrapartum neonatal 
infection, absence of parental consent, or were moribund at birth. We enrolled and 
randomized subjects from the period of July 1, 2009, to March 17, 2012. After hospital 
discharge, a one-year outpatient follow-up period took place. Agennix Inc (Houston, TeXas), 
the trial sponsor, ended the final data analyses in December 2013.

 Agennix provided TLf to three academic health care systems in the United States. Agennix 
used good manufacturing practice and suspended TLf in sterile, endotoxin-free, phosphate-
buffered saline. The excipient served as the placebo with excellent color matching. The 
institutional human review board for each site approved the study. We obtained written 
consent from the parents or legal guardians before 24 hours of age. Thereafter, each 
institutional pharmacy randomized a subject via a central computer system (inVentiv 
Clinical Solutions, Houston, TX). The inVentiv Web Response system also recorded data 
about participants in this RCT. Agennix sponsored the research under a FDA investigational 
new drug policies and procedures. Study design included a data safety monitoring 
committee, a centralized serious adverse event reporting system, and periodic on-site 
monitoring visits that verified clinical, health care, laboratory, radiologic information, and 
pharmacy record keeping.
We randomized infants so they received either TLf solution (150 mg/ml) at a dose of 300 
mg/kg/day or an identical volume of the excipient. We gave doses every 12 hours via 
nasogastric tube from day 1 through the 28th day of life or until discharge, whichever 
occurred first. We extrapolated the dose of TLf from lactoferrin consumed during enteral 
breast milk feeding (150 ml/kg/d) with the content of lactoferrin in human milk estimated at 
2 mg/ml. In all subjects, we administered the first dose before 24 hours of age. We adjusted 
the dose at weekly intervals if the weight increased from a prior weight by ≥10 percent.
Primary and Secondary Outcomes
The primary outcome was a significant reduction in hospital-acquired infections, including 
bacteremia, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, meningitis and NEC. Our criteria were based 
on CDC-related definitions for hospital-acquired infection.13 The sponsor established strict 
criteria for infection, including blood stream infections, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, 
meningitis and necrotizing enterocolitis.14 A diagnosed infection required antibiotics for 
≥72 hours.
Secondary outcomes were mortality, duration of hospitalization, time to regain birth weight, 
and the time to reach full enteral feeds. Disease-related morbidities included a medically- or 
surgically-treated patent ductus arteriosus, intracerebral hemorrhage, periventricular 
leukomalacia, retinopathy of prematurity, chronic lung disease defined as O2 therapy at 36 
weeks of post-conceptual age, suspected NEC, clinical sepsis syndrome and neonatal 
inflammatory response syndrome. We defined a clinical sepsis syndrome as a negative blood 
culture, but clinical and laboratory findings necessitating empiric antibiotic therapy. These 
criteria included elevated inflammatory markers, namely serial C-reactive protein levels 
(≥1.5 mg/dL), abnormal serial white blood cell counts, or an elevated immature/total 
neutrophil ratio (≥0.3), central thermal instability, apnea and bradycardia, or respiratory 
distress. We established suspected NEC as a clinical scenario that involved a cessation of 
enteral feedings and initiation of antibiotics based on gastric residuals, occult or gross blood 
in the stool, abdominal distention, radiographs showing dilated loops of bowel and an 
abnormal bowel gas pattern, but without a sentinel loop nor pneumatosis intestinalis.

 Safety Assessment
We used the MedDRA system to report safety outcomes to the FDA.15 Investigators 
underwent training to use this grading and severity scoring system. This system reports 
adverse or severe adverse events occurring daily using an acceptable FDA measurement 
scale.15 The FDA mandated daily recording of clinical information during the 28-day 
prophylactic period, and infants were then evaluated at weekly intervals until discharge. At 
6- and 12-month post-discharge visits, we collected growth measurements including head 
circumference, health outcomes and developmental progress using the Bayley screener. If 
the participant did not return, investigators contacted the primary care physician, parents by 
telephones call, or parents by US mail to ascertain clinical status.
Agennix did not require any specific collection of clinical findings, laboratory tests, or 
radiologic studies. The FDA IND required information on daily weight and abdominal 
circumference, vital signs, physical examination findings, type and duration of respiratory 
support, O2 saturation, volume and type of enteral feeding, intravenous fluids and total 
parenteral nutrition volume and composition, urinary output, gastric residual volumes, 
number and description of feces passed, concomitant medications. The study protocol 
collected laboratory and radiographic tests as ordered by the supervising neonatal attending. 
Tests included complete blood counts, C-reactive protein, complete metabolic and 
electrolyte panels, blood gas reports, gross or occult blood in feces, and results of all 
radiographic studies. We used the cumulative weight gain from birth and the duration of 
hospitalization as biomarkers of nutritional support.
Sample Size and Statistical Analysis
This RCT focused on safety. We based the original sample size for the Phase 1 study on the 
recommendations of Cohen (similar to G* Power 3.1) for an ANOVA with four groups. 
Using a power of .80, an effect size of .5, and an alpha of 0.05, a minimum of 48 total 
subjects was necessary to complete the safety phase of the study. We based the Phase 2 
sample size calculations on the same statistical parameters, but with a reduction in the effect 
size to .175 resulting in a minimum total sample of 360 subjects. Allowing for 10% attrition, 
we estimated 396 subjects were necessary. Because of reduced funding, we lowered our 
sample size from 396 to 120 VLBW infants in two groups, TLf (n = 60) and placebo (n = 
60). Thus, the investigation was underpowered to identify significant primary or secondary 
outcomes.
Investigators recorded clinical, laboratory and radiologic findings, disease states, and 
adverse events into the inVentiv SAS database. We performed statistical analysis using SAS 
version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Descriptive statistics included frequencies, 
percentages, and measures of central tendency. We analyzed ratio level data such as blood 
count values, C-reactive protein, and the volume of gastric residuals with the independent-
samples t test; however, if the data was not normally distributed, we used the Mann-Whitney 
U test. Nominal data was analyzed with the Chi-square test of Independence or the Fisher 
exact test if cells had values less than five. To measure cumulative weight gain at discharge, 
we utilized a mixed effects regression model that accounted for treatment, feeding strata, 
birth weight, and days since birth as explanatory variables. Clinical significance was

 determined using risk indices, namely relative risk (RR), 95% confidence interval, and 
numbers needed to treat (NNT). The safety monitoring board used these measures to 
ascertain TLf-related adverse events and to determine primary and secondary outcomes.
RESULTS
Table I shows demographics of the preterm infants and mothers associated with the clinical 
trial. Mothers declared their decision regarding breast milk or formula feeding during the 
consent process. The pharmacy used a mother’s feeding decision during randomization. 
Hence, assignments were equal to TLf or versus placebo and enteral nutrition with mother’s 
milk and formula. Human donor milk was not used. during the trial.
We present a CONSORT diagram as the Figure (available at www.jpeds.com). Thirty-seven 
infants (62%) completed the entire 28-day TLf-treatment period and 44 infants (73%) 
completed the entire placebo arm. One infant assigned to the TLf arm died of brain stem 
hemorrhage at 30 hours of age and we excluded this infant from outcome assessment. One 
infant in the TLf arm died of sudden infant death syndrome after discharge. One infant in the 
placebo arm died of necrotizing enterocolitis with sepsis. Among 23 infants in the TLf arm 
who did not complete an entire course, the reasons for discontinuing therapy included: (1) 
discharge before the 28th day (n=4); (2) death; (3) medical or surgical therapy for a 
hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus, suspected NEC, or enteral feeding 
problems (n=18). In the placebo arm of the study, thirteen infants ended the placebo dosing 
before the 28th study day; reasons for cessation of the placebo were a) discharge home 
before the 28th day (n=13), b) withdrawal of consent (n=1), and c) an attending 
neonatologist stopped the placebo in four infants.
The number of doses received, duration of drug exposure, and total drug intake (mg) were 
not statistically different between the two arms. Drug compliance was 94.6% in the group 
with Tlf and 96% in the placebo group.
At the 6-month follow-up visit, we ascertained the health and developmental status in 88 and 
80% of subjects treated with TLf and placebo, respectively. At the 12-month follow-up visit, 
we evaluated 55% and 52% percent of infants given TLf or placebo, respectively. Telephone 
calls indicated that missed appointments were due to good health and development in the 
infant, time away from work, or travel-related distance.
Safety Outcomes
Table II shows the incidence and type of adverse events occurring in the study population. 
The overall rate of at least one treatment emergent AE was similar between the two study 
arms. We identified adverse events related most often to preterm birth rather than TLf or the 
placebo. Gastrointestinal (76%), blood and lymphatic (60%), nutrition and metabolism 
(72%) and respiratory disorders (72%) were the most commonly reported treatment 
emergent AE. These events were often the reason for study drug or placebo discontinuation. 
Rates of at least one SAE were also similar between treatment and placebo arms. All SAE 
were associated with complications of very preterm birth rather than administration of TLf 
or placebo. The Data Safety Monitoring Board never halted the progression of the RCT.

 Primary Outcomes
Table III summarizes the primary outcome. Infants who received TLf had a reduced risk for 
hospital-acquired infections during the NICU stay (RR 0.52 [95% CI 0.26–0.99], p<0.045). 
There were no cases of meningitis. Two infants treated with TLf developed NEC and both 
survived, and one formula-fed infant given placebo died from NEC.
Table IV shows the types of bacteria causing infections. In the TLf group, there was a 
reduction in Gram-positive bacterial isolates with coagulase-negative staphylococci 
accounting for most of these isolates. In 14 infants <1 kg birth weight, we identified no cases 
of Gram-negative bacterial infection and two cases of CoNS-related bacteremia (14%). In 
the placebo group, five of 14 (36%) of infants with a birth weight <1 kg had bacteremia 
caused by CoNS (n=2) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1); two infants had pneumonia caused 
by Klebsiella oxytoca.
Secondary and Other Efficacy Outcomes
Secondary outcomes including cumulative weight gain from birth and duration of 
hospitalization did not differ between study arms or feeding type. Follow-up records in the 
SAS database after hospital discharge identified no abnormalities in growth or development 
between infants treated with TLf and placebo. We proposed TLf might reduce inflammation 
in treated infants.9 The peak C-reactive protein level was not different between infants fed 
TLf (n = 30) vs placebo (n = 38) (1.6 ± 1.6 mg/dL vs 2.8 ± 6.0 mg/, respectively).
DISCUSSION
Four investigative groups have published clinical trial information using enteral 
administration of bovine lactoferrin to prevent late-onset sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis 
during hospitalization of infants with birth weights ≤2000 grams.16–19 The current RCT is a 
Phase 1/2 trial that provides safety and preliminary efficacy data associated with enteral 
administration of TLf. The study used a recombinant human lactoferrin produced under 
‘good manufacturing practices’ and with Food and Drug Administration approval as an 
Investigational New Drug. This study also used the MedDRA system to measure safety 
during and after administration of TLf, an instrument used by the International Conference 
on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for 
Human Use.12 The results demonstrate the safety of the TLf molecule and provide an initial 
report of efficacy related to reducing hospital-acquired infections and possibly other non-
infectious related outcomes.
Among the four previous studies using bovine lactoferrin in preterm infants, each observed a 
reduced rate of infection of a variable magnitude, and one report using prophylaxis with 
bovine lactoferrin noted a reduction in late onset sepsis among infants <1 kg birth weight.16 
In the current TLf trial, we found a 14% rate of infection in <1 kg birth weight infants given 
enteral TLf versus 36% in babies fed placebo. Our report is in agreement with Manzoni et 
al,16 with comparable reductions in infection in extremely preterm infants. In all studies 
using bovine lactoferrin, the biologic agent was “generally regarded as safe” as a food 
supplement. In contrast, the source of taloctoferrin was biotechnology rather than a food

 supplement isolated from bovine milk. Furthermore, compared to the aforementioned RCT 
using bovine lactoferrin,16 TLf had therapeutic efficacy in reducing Gram-positive bacterial 
infections similar to bLf (Table IV). We propose this decline caused the overall reduction in 
hospital-acquired infections in infants treated with TLf vs. placebo (Table III).
Infants fed TLf had no urinary tract infections compared to placebo, but this was not 
statistically significant. Recently, an association between urinary infections and NEC was 
reported.20 Because the fecal microbiome is a microbial reservoir for urogenital 
colonization, we suggest a possible relationship between enteric prophylaxis with TLf and 
reduced urinary infections, and would encourage examination of this association in 
upcoming clinical trials of bovine lactoferrin. Future studies of lactoferrin prophylaxis 
should study the fecal microbiome because the microbiota present may be transferred other 
body sites. Metagenomic technology can accurately classify the fecal translocation of 
pathogenic bacteria originating in the feces.21
Finally, studies in progress should evaluate the safety of lactoferrin by using an 
internationally accepted method like MedDRA. Based on the suggested mechanisms of 
action for lactoferrin,9,18 we suggest that future RCTs also report on differences in 
inflammatory biomarkers between lactoferrin- and placebo-control subjects. One attractive 
strategy might be examining inflammation in twins that are randomized to enteral lactoferrin 
vs. placebo. Thoughtful adaptations of the traditional RCT design may provide opportunities 
to test whether lactoferrin supplementation will reduce infectious and other morbidities in 
VLBW infants.
