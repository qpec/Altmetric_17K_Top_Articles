Introduction
There is currently substantial debate about the merits of an imminent United Kingdom (UK) tax 
on sugar-sweetened beverages and snacks that are high in sugar.1 The most recent Scientific 
Advisory Committee report2 advises a reduction of dietary sugar consumption in the UK; 
however, because of the furore surrounding sugar, the role of starchy carbohydrates as a source of 
blood sugar (glucose) has become understated, and the important role of the glycaemic index (GI) 
has become somewhat eclipsed. This article explains the GI as a predictor of the effect of food 
choices on blood glucose. We question whether higher GI carbohydrates (refined or unrefined) 
should also be viewed with caution in the diet and ask, for the purpose of communication with 
patients: can starch be viewed as a concentrated sugar?
While working in the area of dietary choices for patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) 
in a primary care setting,3 we observed that many health professionals and patients when 
considering dietary choices were confused by the relative merits of using carbohydrate content of 
food in grams versus the foods’ GI. Among the professionals, many erroneously assumed table 
sugar to affect blood glucose far more than the carbohydrate in a baked potato, for example, and 
others wrongly assumed that carbohydrate in different foods had a similar effect on blood glucose.
GI and glycaemic load (GL) values have been tabulated for the various carbohydrate foods.4 The 
position of any food in a GI or GL league table is determined by the food’s effect on post-prandial 
blood glucose. This is determined by both the type and the amount of carbohydrates in the food 
and also how quickly the food can be digested. For compliance with guidelines on healthy eating, 
separate league tables for each food group in the guidelines can be advised. The effect of foods on 
Background: The low-carbohydrate diet for diabetes and obesity is over 200 years old. A new 
lease of life comes with evidence for its beneficial effects supplied by research into the value of 
low-glycaemic index (GI) foods in diabetes control. While trialling this approach it became 
evident that professionals and patients had previously misunderstood the index leading to 
errors in food choices. 
Aim: To explore the importance of the GI for those with T2D and improve understanding of 
the likely effect of various foods on blood glucose. 
Setting: A 9000 patient United Kingdom (UK) primary care practice.
Methods: Relevant supporting studies were examined and data were reviewed from a 
previously published case-series with new data relating to the effect of the approach on the 
whole practice over a period of three years. An improved interpretation of the GI using a 
‘teaspoons of sugar equivalent’ was developed as an aide to understanding. We looked at 
quality markers for diabetes and obesity such as HbA1c and weight. 
Results: Our approach was readily understood by patients and staff, helping to achieve 
significant improvements in diabetes control and weight. The practice as a whole compared to 
the average for the area was found to have; a significantly better quality of diabetes control, 
lower obesity prevalence whilst spending around £40 000 less per year on drugs for diabetes.
Conclusion: Greater consideration needs to be given to the harmful effects of high-GI starchy 
foods in the treatment and prevention of obesity and diabetes. Patient compliance and 
outcomes justify our approach in a primary care setting.

blood glucose is indexed to a standard amount of a pure 
carbohydrate, a sugar or glucose. Indexing results in the 
foods’ GI of GL values are independent of a person’s ability 
to control blood glucose; hence, GI and GL are applicable to 
both healthy persons and patients with pre-diabetes or 
diabetes. Unfortunately, most people we encountered, 
including health professionals, struggled to visualise the GL 
in grams for a portion of a food because it was an expression 
with which they were unfamiliar. Furthermore, people may 
struggle to visualise a gram, kilocalorie or kilojoule of sugar 
but are generally familiar with the quantity ‘a teaspoonful 
of sugar’, which we use in our approach to visually 
communicate the effects of different foods on blood glucose 
concentrations. Thus, we considered that it may be more 
helpful to use the more familiar 4 g teaspoon of sugar as our 
unit of reference. The idea was that this would help patients 
with pre-diabetes or diabetes to understand the relative 
glycaemic consequences of dietary choices such as boiled 
rice, cornflakes and a slice of bread compared with, for 
example, broccoli. It is possible that a teaspoon of glucose 
might achieve a similar goal; however, patients perceive the 
importance of table sugar more readily and are without 
confusion about what glucose is. It should be pointed out to 
patients that table sugar contains fruit sugar (fructose) as 
well as glucose, and fructose has health concerns all of its 
own when consumed in excess.5,6,7 It is not the purpose here 
to discuss the relative merits of fructose versus glucose about 
which there is a long-standing unresolved controversy;8,9,10,11,12 
rather, our purpose is to emphasise that high glycaemic 
starchy foods also have significant health concerns,13 possibly 
greater than for table sugar14 or saturated fats.15
In view of the confusion (described above) we encountered 
over the carbohydrate-related terms (GI and GL) that 
are used among health practitioners, we provide their 
derivation here.
Glycaemic index
Subsequent to an earlier study,16 David Jenkins and colleagues 
introduced the term ‘glycaemic index’ to rank the different 
carbohydrates in various foods by their ability to raise blood 
glucose after their ingestion, relative to the rise for the same 
amount of carbohydrate from a standard reference food, now 
pure glucose.17 The GI may be obtained from food tables4 or 
by original determination using an International Organization 
for Standardization standard method.18 The GI is calculated 
as 100 times the 2-h post-prandial blood glucose response 
(incremental area under the curve) to a food containing 50 g 
of carbohydrate divided by the 2-h post-prandial blood 
glucose response to 50 g glucose, each in 10 persons of normal 
health. If the food volume surrounding 50 g of the particular 
carbohydrate is too much to eat (as in a food with low-
carbohydrate density such as broccoli), then lower doses 
can be tested provided that the standard reference includes 
the equivalent amount of carbohydrate as glucose. The 
correlation between GI values obtained in persons with T2D 
and those in normal health is very high (0.94) so that GI 
values in normal persons can be used in those with diabetes.4 
The high correlation also means that the GI is essentially 
independent of the degree of glucose intolerance from health 
to T2D.
An assumption among many health professionals we 
observed was that carbohydrate-based foods have a GI 
lower than that of table sugar; although this view was 
commonly held, it can be seen to be wrong for some common 
foods because the GI of table sugar (GI 65) is similar to or 
lower than the GI of some starchy foods, for example, 
basmati rice (GI 69), wholemeal bread (GI 74) and baked 
potato (GI 86) (see Figure 1, data column 1). This error 
affected food choices being recommended by health 
professionals and being adopted by patients. Therefore, 
while cutting table sugar from their diets, patients would 
still consume large quantities of starchy foods being unaware 
of the real consequences for blood glucose. GI compares 
foods for a standard amount of that particular carbohydrate. 
What health practitioners also need to take into account is 
the GL; this has the additional benefits of taking into account 
the carbohydrate content of the food and a likely portion size 
for any particular food eaten.
Glycaemic load
GL was introduced via epidemiological work that positively 
related the incidence of T2D to post-prandial increments in 
blood glucose from foods.19 In assessing the effect of a 
particular food on blood glucose, there are two important 
questions:
1. What is the density of carbohydrate in the food?
2. How does the particular carbohydrate in a typical portion 
of that food affect post-prandial blood glucose?
In talking with health professionals and patients, we 
abbreviated these questions about the food. It seemed to help 
communication, to ask about any food, saying:
1. How carby is it? (Q1)
2. How sugary is that particular carb? (Q2)
Note that the two questions investigate the total available 
(digestible) carbohydrate content of a serving or portion of 
food (g/serving) (Q 1) together with the GI of the carbohydrate 
in the food (Q2). For health professionals, we show the 
calculations made for baked potato by using glucose as the 
reference standard (Box 1), which gives a value that 
nutritionists call the ‘glycaemic load per serving’ (with units 
of g/serving). In this case, the GL generated by 150 g (about 
5 oz.) of baked potato is shown to be equivalent to 22 g of 
pure glucose, which is important information, especially for 
someone with diabetes. The epidemiological work on 
incident T2D initiated by Salmeron et al.19,20 has now been 
expanded to 24 studies worldwide, for which meta-analyses 
reveal a strong dose-response T2D-GL relation,21 implying 
with support of interventional studies13 that diets lower in 
GL can be preventative of T2D. The GL per standard serving 
of food item also varies (Figure 2).

Communicating glycaemic load as 
teaspoonful of a familiar 
carbohydrate
For this purpose, we use table sugar as the familiar carbohydrate. 
In an earlier version of Figure 1, glucose was used by the 
Norwood Surgery to demonstrate to several hundred patients 
the effects of standard portions of various foods on blood 
glucose and was also piloted with a group of 20 doctors. Many 
found it very difficult to believe that the figure’s data were 
correct because they thought sugar would have a greater effect 
on the blood glucose response than that produced by most 
starchy foods. It was also evident that patients were unfamiliar 
with and confused by pure glucose as the benchmark, being far 
more accustomed to ‘table sugar’ in daily use.
A teaspoonful of sugar was thought easier for patients to 
visualise than the equivalent of pure glucose, and hence the 
updated depiction of Figure 1. For health professionals, we 
show the calculations for brown bread (wholemeal) in Box 2 as 
an example. Firstly, the steps in Box 1 are followed for both the 
brown bread and the table sugar (given in Box 2). Then, the GL 
(g/per serving) of the brown bread is re-expressed by dividing 
by the GL of a 4-g serving of table sugar (one teaspoonful). In 
this way, it can be seen that a small slice (30 g) of wholemeal 
bread is equivalent to more than three teaspoons of table sugar 
in terms of resultant blood glucose response – again which is 
important information for someone with diabetes.
Figure 1 shows that the teaspoonful of table sugar equivalents 
for GL per serving varies considerably between some common 
foods, with values ranging from 0.2 teaspoons for broccoli to an 
alarming 10.1 teaspoons of sugar for a portion of basmati rice. 
Our first question (how carby is it?) explains why a food like 
broccoli with a moderately high-GI of 54 has little actual effect 
on blood glucose (Figure 1); it is because the blood glucose

response depends on the density of carbohydrates in the food 
and the amount of carbohydrates in broccoli is very low, the 
food being largely water. Therefore, for broccoli, the blood 
glucose response is very low, and almost independent of the 
food’s high-GI. However, for foods containing a lot of 
carbohydrates (e.g. ‘starchy’ foods), the resultant post-
prandial blood glucose response strongly depends on the 
carbohydrate’s GI – it is these foods that have the potential 
for harm, particularly for those with obesity and diabetes.
Method: High glycaemic index 
carbohydrate-restricted diets at the 
Norwood Surgery
A carbohydrate-restricted diet in diabetes therapy has the 
main objective of reducing patient exposure to too high a 
post-prandial blood glucose response to carbohydrate 
foods.22 This is achieved with a low-carbohydrate diet, 
which has been defined as one supplying ≤ 130 g 
carbohydrate a day. A long history of research led to a 
scientific case for their adoption in diabetes and obesity 
therapy (Box 3). At the Norwood Surgery, a UK suburban 
practice with over 9000 patients, of whom 850 had diabetes 
or pre-diabetes, exposure to post-prandial blood glucose 
was reduced with the aid of a pamphlet ‘So what should 
I eat to control Diabetes or Pre-diabetes?’23; the pamphlet 
was used without weighing food or calorie counting, but it 
recommended ‘reduce starchy or sugary foods … if possible 
cut out bread, pasta, potatoes, rice … and sugar … and also 
cakes and biscuits’ which are all higher or high-GI foods. An 
infographic ‘teaspoons of sugar’ was used to aid patient 
understanding of the glycaemic consequences of their food 
choices (Figure 1). As an example, this includes banana 
among foods to cut out (a single ripe banana is equivalent to 
5.7 teaspoons of sugar). Green vegetables, salads, tomatoes, 
onions, berries such as blueberries, raspberries and 
strawberries, and nuts were to be eaten freely as they were 
low in carbohydrate; however, tropical fruits often with 
either higher GI or higher GL (e.g. banana [already 
mentioned], mangoes and pineapple) were to be cut. The 
pamphlet also included advice on other food groups such as 
dairy, meat, fish, nuts and healthy fats.
The 69 study subjects had abnormal liver function, diabetes 
or 
impaired 
glucose 
tolerance 
and 
were 
selected 
opportunistically from patients at the Norwood Surgery. 
Advised to consume diets according to their pamphlet, they 
were given regular feedback, often in graphic form of the 
BOX 2: Calculations of the table sugar equivalent of a slice of brown bread.
Example for a brown bread of serving weigh 30 g (one small slice):
1.  
How carby is it? It has 40 g carb per 100g, so 40 x 30/100 = 12 g of brown 
bread carbohydrate.
2.  
How sugary is the carb? Brown bread carb has a GI of 74, so 12 x 74/100 = 9 g 
glycaemic load in the 30g serve size of brown bread.
Example for a teaspoon of sugar:
1. How carby is it? It has 4.2 g carb* per teaspoon.
2.  
How sugary is the carb? Table sugar carb has a GI of 65, so 4.2 x 65/100 = 2.73 g 
glycaemic load in the teaspoon of table sugar.
Finally:
3. How does the brown bread compare with a teaspoon of table sugar?
The 30 g serving of brown bread has a glycaemic load of 9 g.
The teaspoon of sugar has a glycaemic load of 2.73 g.
So, the brown bread is 9/2.73 = 3.3 times more (blood ) sugary than the 
teaspoon of sugar.
*, One might assume 1 g sucrose yields 1 g carbohydrate as monosaccharide (glucose) 
equivalent weight, but it yields 1.05 g equivalents. This is why in Figure 2 the 10 g of sucrose 
has a glycaemic load of 7 and not 6.5.

BOX 3: A history of sugar and carbohydrate restriction in diabetes and health.
Prior to 1776 Diabetes had been widely considered to be a disease of the kidneys, best treated by replacing the sugar lost in the urine (tested by the urine’s sweetness), with 
increased sugar in the diet  – a regime which sounds ludicrous today.
1776 Matthew Dobson, a Liverpudlian physician, went a step further; he noticed that blood tasted sweet, too; thus, he discovered hyperglycaemia and realised that the metabolic 
fault occurred prior to the kidneys.
1797 Carbohydrate-restricted diets seem to have entered the consciousness of the medical profession in this year when John Rollo,a a Scottish physician to the Army, entered the 
debate surrounding the character and management of type 2 diabetes. Rollo, by boiling down urine to sugar, found that if the obese (232 pounds or 105 kg) Captain Meredith ate 
less ‘farinaceous’ (starchy) food, less urinary sugar was produced. Hence, Rollo pioneering a low-carbohydrate dietary approach, which eliminated frequent urination, reversed 
elevated sugar in both blood and urine and led to the loss of excess body weight.
1848 Claude Bernard, a renowned physiologist, investigates the role of the liver in blood sugar production, and dietary starches in particular, which both affect the milieu interieur 
(homeostasis) in diabetes.b
1863 William Banting, a relative of the Nobel Prize winner Frederick Banting, wrote the first commercial diet. His ‘Letter on Corpulence Addressed to the Public’c promoted the 
low-carbohydrate approach. Prior to this, Banting had become so obese that he was unable to tie his shoelaces and was forced to walk downstairs backwards to ease the pressure 
on his knees. By the age of 65 when he weighed 202 lbs (92 kg) and hearing loss added to his co-morbidities, he consulted ‘the celebrated aurist’ William Harvey, who serendipitously 
had recently attended a lecture in Paris by Claude Bernard. Harvey, using Banting as his ‘guinea pig’, advised him to cut all starchy food from his diet, which had a dramatic effect, 
inducing a weight loss of over 3 stone (19 kg), accompanied by a transformation in his health.
1863–1956 Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, a reduced carbohydrate diet was considered to be the standard therapy for both diabetes and obesity and was 
recognised and taught by such eminent physicians as Nathan Smith,d James Salisbury,e Frederick Allen,f Elliott Joslin,g Alfred Pennington,h and Raymond Greene.i
1956 In highly controversial studies,j Ancel Keys published,k on cholesterol and heart disease.1 This overturned the prevailing idea about diet, which gave rise to low-fat diets as 
being beneficial, and arguably laid the foundation of the current obesity and diabetes epidemic. Only now is the low-carbohydrate dietary approach returning to prominence in 
dietary therapy for diabetes.

results of their bimonthly blood tests and also weight and 
blood pressure (BP).
In addition to the case study group the approach was rolled 
out as an option to the total practice population via the 
practice nurses and partners. Of the practice population six 
went on the low carb diet themselves. This was done not only 
on an individual basis but also via our regular evening group 
sessions which included any interested relatives.
Results
Outcomes from the Norwood Surgery Study
Compliance to the dietary advice was evident as 68 of 69 
patients beginning the study completed an average of 
13 months dietary treatment.3 Patient satisfaction with the 
diet was high from reports of feeling better and having more 
energy. Mean body weight fell by 9.0 kg (p < 0.001), waist 
circumference fell by 15 cm (p < 0.0001), blood glucose control 
measured as HbA1c fell by 10 mmol/mol or 19% (p < 0.001), 
liver function measured as serum glutamyl transferase 
improved by 39% (p < 0.001) and cholesterol fell by 5% (p < 
0.001). Systolic and diastolic BPs dropped significantly too (p 
< 0.005). Plasma triglycerides were not measured, but in 
common with prior observations for low-carbohydrate diets 
a significant improvement would have been anticipated.22
Dietary advice to avoid, so far as possible, common higher GI 
carbohydrate foods rather than only sugar or any 
carbohydrate food has continued now for over 3 years at the 
Norwood Surgery. In addition to the published study results 
noted 
above, 
significant 
practice-wide 
improvements 
occurred:
1. Diabetes drug spend is down, now saving approximately 
£45 000 ($65 000) per year against the regional average, 
and represents the lowest spend per 1000 patients in any 
of the 19 surgeries in the surrounding Southport (UK) 
and Formby area for which information was available 
(Figure 3). This saving should be seen against the extra 
costs of the Norwood Surgery diabetes intervention at 
just under £9000 ($13 000) per year.
2. Obesity prevalence at Norwood Surgery based on body 
mass index (BMI) is down too (Quality and Outcome 
Framework figures for England 2012–2015). Before the 
study, the prevalence was 9.4% at Norwood, which has 
now dropped to 8.4%. This compared to the figures for 
England as a whole where the prevalence is now 9.0%.
3. Overall practice markers for diabetes control have also 
improved: nationally, the English primary care Quality 
and Outcome Framework marker of successful diabetic 
control is an HbA1c of ≤ 59 mmol/mol. Previously, 59.6% 
of our patients met this target, and now 65.4% of patients 
do so, an improvement of 5.8%. This is against an average 
achievement of 60.4% for England.
Discussion
It is now de rigueur to display cubes of sugar in front of fizzy 
drinks at diabetes conferences to represent their vast sugar 
content, whereas the effect of, for example, brown bread 
(whole grain) on blood sugar is trivialised: we may hear 
‘there is hardly any sugar in bread’ and ‘it is a good source of

energy for people with diabetes’. However, higher GI staples 
are a significant source of blood sugar4 and data we report 
from our primary care setting suggest that these staples are 
neither a good source of energy for diabetes and pre-diabetes 
patients nor helpful in curtailing expenditure on drugs for 
diabetes. It is a matter of concern that poor understanding of 
GI by doctors and health care professionals has led us to 
underestimate the importance of knowing the different 
glycaemic effects of various carbohydrates foods. Although 
all fruits may be recommended for health improvement, it is 
noteworthy that those with lower GI are preferable to those 
with higher GI in diabetes patients, lowering HbA1c, BP and 
coronary heart disease risk,24 and even among persons 
adherent to a diet considered healthy (e.g. the Mediterranean 
diet); those consuming a lower GL diet are at lower risk of 
diabetes.25
We recommend that dietary starch should be considered to 
be the equivalent of concentrated glucose; indeed, starches 
comprise condensed molecules of glucose. In the Norwood 
primary care practice, this knowledge helps general 
practitioners, health care professionals and patients to 
understand that starches are a significant source of blood 
glucose. Moreover, people generally eat equally as much, 
and often more, carbohydrate from starchy foods as from 
sugary foods and drinks; therefore, there should arguably 
be equal or more concern about the starchy foods we eat. 
A possible flaw in the table sugar equivalent system we 
trialled was that patients might increase dietary  sucrose 
perceiving it less of a threat than say bread. In practice, this 
was not a problem because all those joining the program 
had as their first priority the elimination of table sugar from 
their diets. This addresses the point that dealing with 
glycaemia is only one aspect of the complex goal of 
improving diet, others being possible nutrient dilution in 
an energy-restricted diet, and also the controversial dangers 
of fructose as noted above.
A suggested criticism of the GI is that it is ‘unreliable’ because 
the index depends on how food is prepared. Thus, raw or 
unground foods have a less effect on blood glucose compared 
to cooked or ground foods. But turning this around, this is 
the information that would be really helpful to someone 
with diabetes or obesity, when used in the present dietary 
context.
A further criticism of GI is that it is confusing for patients 
practising carbohydrate exchange if they are not familiar 
with glucose or the GI and their education on these in 
primary care is unsatisfactory. However, by using GI and 
therefore deriving GL and expressing the value in terms of 
teaspoons of table sugar, which is more familiar to patients, 
they may be successful in taking control of their diabetes. The 
level of control in the Norwood patients would be unexpected 
if patients were confused or non-compliant. Moreover, 
because the objective is to lower the patient’s GL by including 
restriction on high-GI carbohydrate staples, there is no 
precise target to achieve, such as those practised in scenarios 
demanding carbohydrate exchange which is easier to 
combine with family life as there is no weighing of food in 
this approach.
Besides improvement in body weight and diabetes markers, 
the cost savings attributed to the lower GI, lower carb dietary 
pamphlet and motivational support described are substantial. 
The patients’ diet was well tolerated whereas drugs for 
diabetes, which we find so many patients can avoid, may 
have questionable efficacy.26 Also patients often can be 
intolerant to widely used drugs, for example, metformin.27 
Dietary treatment allows patients to take control of 
themselves; by contrast drug treatment inevitably leaves the 
patient dependent on the health service, with many having to 
face these drug-related problems.
The improved outcomes (discussed above) were achieved in 
the Norwood study partly by reducing sugar in the diet and 
partly by counselling both patients and health care 
professionals in the team about the effect of eating certain 
(higher GI) starchy foods on blood glucose and body weight. 
For example, the effect of bread or rice is just as great as the 
more readily understood effect of sugary foods. But as 
already mentioned, this message was better understood 
when translated into teaspoons of table sugar as shown in 
Figure 1.
It is likely that better patient motivation also assisted the 
improved outcomes in the Norwood study group (n = 68) 
and practice-wide (n = 850 diabetic and pre-diabetic patients). 
This was augmented by handing out individual results of 
patients’ progress in the form of graphs on a bimonthly 
basis.
The patients in the Norwood Surgery study with impaired 
glucose tolerance and T2D experienced a reduction in 
HbA1c, which can be explained in good part by reductions 
in dietary exposure to GL through manipulation of GI28 
or carbohydrate load22 or both together. This not only 
indicates improved glycaemic control but also suggests 
reduced risks for complications, cardiovascular disease 
and mortality.29,30,31
The dietary concept applied at Norwood is possibly 
applicable to persons using insulin pumps or injections. 
Patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) consuming lower GI diets 
have better blood glucose control (as judged by HbA1c) than 
those consuming higher GI carbohydrates.32 Also, T1D 
patients on low-carbohydrate diets have shown improved 
stability of glycaemic control and reduced number and 
severity of hypoglycaemic episodes while allowing less error 
in matching insulin requirements to carbohydrate intake.33 
Lowering the insulin requirement would also lower the risk 
of exogenous insulin-related weight gain.
The majority of patients at the start of the Norwood study 
were overweight or obese (mean body weight 100 ± 16 kg 
and waist circumference 120 ± 10 cm); the body weight and

waist reductions found therefore applied to this class of 
patients once glucose intolerance was evident. The weight 
reduction in the primary care setting achieved by the 
Norwood study is in agreement with the weight reduction by 
both lowering of dietary GL as reported from meta-analysis 
of intervention studies28 and lowering of carbohydrate intake 
as reported from narrative review.22
The Norwood Study found greater lowering of waist 
circumference (less than 15%) than body weight (less than 
9%). In agreement, other studies indicate that exposure to 
diets with higher GI carbohydrate can elevate abdominal or 
visceral adiposity.34,35,36,37,38 These findings make an important 
point that body weight and BMI (kg/m2) may not be 
sensitive to moderate abdominal fat accumulation when 
accompanied by muscle wasting. There is no doubt about 
the significance of threat that obesity poses to health. The 
risks of metabolic complications are substantially increased 
‘in men with a waist measurement > 102 cm’ and ‘in women 
with a waist measurement > 88 cm’.39 Moreover, reduction 
of visceral obesity is accompanied by normalisation of 
insulin secretion and hepatic insulin sensitivity,40 which are 
hallmarks of T2D.
We feel that our lower carb approach is arguably applicable 
to the general population. Impaired glucose tolerance and 
obesity are increasingly prevalent worldwide. There is strong 
evidence from comprehensive meta-analyses of prospective 
cohort studies that lower exposure to dietary GL reduces the 
risk of incident T2D in both men and women independently 
of dietary or cereal fibre intake,21,41 likewise for GI with 
similar strength (Livesey et al., in press), and likewise too for 
a low-carbohydrate diet score in women.42,43 Even among 
non-diabetic populations, high-GI carbohydrate (starchy) 
food consumption is associated with a higher risk for 
developing T2D compared with sugar, whereas lower GI is 
associated with a lower risk.14 Worryingly, too, a study15 has 
shown that higher GI carbohydrates associate with a higher 
risk for myocardial infarction compared with saturated fat, 
whereas low-GI carbohydrate gave a lower risk. Finally, a 
recent consensus summit and review indicated that lower GI, 
GL and glycaemic response might also reduce the risk of 
acquiring several different cancers.13,44
Consuming too many higher or high-GI starchy staples does 
not appear to be good for people in the general population, 
particularly so for obese, T2D and pre-diabetes patients. We 
consider this is linked to higher or rapid rates of glucose 
absorption and the consequential higher blood glucose levels 
after digestion.
High-GI starchy food: A probable 
spoiler of predicted health and 
economic benefits of recently 
issued dietary guidelines
Reducing the consumption of sugar alone leaves patients 
and the general public still at risk of exposure to high-GI 
starchy foods; this is especially for the large proportion 
(approximately 50%) of the population who are overweight, 
obese, glucose intolerant or diabetic, and likely too for 
persons of normal body weight (Livesey et al., in press). 
This problem is likely to be exacerbated by dietary 
guidelines that recommend the replacement of energy from 
sugar by starch,1,2 including their adoption in the new 
Eatwell Guide;45 this is because a large proportion of 
starchy food eaten is of high-GI, which appears harmful 
compared with sugar (other than in drinks with which 
starch is essentially incompatible unless hydrolysed to 
maltodextrin, which is also high in GI and possibly also 
harmful compared with sugar). Notably too, recent verbal 
suggestions to lower alcohol consumption to zero to 
maximally reduce the risk of cancers rather than follow 
proposed guidelines46 may leave individuals at greater risk 
of metabolically related disease because of the present level 
of consumption of high-GI starches. This arises because 
moderate alcohol consumption attenuates the risk of T2D 
arising from diets high in GL, whereas zero intake may 
double the risk of both diabetes,47 and possibly other 
conditions (e.g. coronary heart disease)44 that are related to 
high-GI starch consumption. For these two reasons, it is 
possible that recent dietary guidelines issued by Public 
Health England (PHE)1,45 based on the work of Scientific 
Advisory Committee on Nutrition2 will not be as effective 
for combating the joint epidemic of obesity and T2D as the 
PHE believes – high-GI starchy foods being the spoiler of 
the good intentions behind the guidelines.
Most of the evidence of harm from high-GI starchy staples 
was unavailable in 1991 when the Committee on Medical 
Aspects of Foods48 of the Department of Health of the United 
Kingdom was unable to find evidence of harm from starches. 
The lack of evidence has allowed dietary guidelines to 
include in their advice that energy needs not met by guideline 
amounts of protein, and fat (and alcohol), should be made up 
by starch. This position is no longer tenable. It is clear to us 
that high-GI carbohydrate foods are a societal problem in 
urgent need of resolve (Table 1).
