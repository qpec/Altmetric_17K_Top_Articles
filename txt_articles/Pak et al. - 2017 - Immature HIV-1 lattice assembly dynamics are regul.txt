The packaging and budding of Gag polyprotein and viral RNA is a
critical step in the HIV-1 life cycle. High-resolution structures of the
Gag polyprotein have revealed that the capsid (CA) and spacer
peptide 1 (SP1) domains contain important interfaces for Gag self-
assembly. However, the molecular details of the multimerization
process, especially in the presence of RNA and the cell membrane,
have remained unclear. In this work, we investigate the mechanisms
that work in concert between the polyproteins, RNA, and membrane
to promote immature lattice growth. We develop a coarse-grained
(CG) computational model that is derived from subnanometer
resolution structural data. Our simulations recapitulate contiguous
and hexameric lattice assembly driven only by weak anisotropic
attractions at the helical CA–SP1 junction. Importantly, analysis from
CG and single-particle tracking photoactivated localization (spt-
PALM) trajectories indicates that viral RNA and the membrane are
critical constituents that actively promote Gag multimerization
through scaffolding, while overexpression of short competitor
RNA can suppress assembly. We also find that the CA amino-
terminal domain imparts intrinsic curvature to the Gag lattice. As a
consequence, immature lattice growth appears to be coupled to the
dynamics of spontaneous membrane deformation. Our findings elu-
cidate a simple network of interactions that regulate the early
stages of HIV-1 assembly and budding.

H
IV type 1 (HIV-1) spreads infection through a robust rep-
lication cycle. A critical step during this life cycle is the as-
sembly and packaging of viral proteins and RNA at the plasma
membrane interface, followed by the budding and release of
immature virions (1–4). Understanding the molecular mecha-
nisms that regulate this process may highlight opportunities for
antiretroviral treatment strategies.
The main structural constituent throughout HIV-1 replication is
the group-specific antigen (Gag) polyprotein (5, 6), which com-
prises around 50% of the viral particle mass (7). Gag contains
several functional domains: the matrix (MA) domain for mem-
brane association, the capsid (CA) domain for protein–protein
association, the nucleocapsid (NC) domain for RNA association,
the p6 domain for endosomal sorting complex required for
transport (ESCRT) machinery recruitment, and the spacer peptide
1 (SP1) and 2 (SP2) domains. Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-
ET) experiments have demonstrated that Gag polyproteins form
hexameric lattices that are highly pleomorphic within immature
virions and arrested budding sites (7–11). While largely contiguous,
the immature polyprotein shell of HIV-1 remains incomplete—a
notable difference from icosahedral viruses—such that only
40–70% coverage is observed in immature virions (8, 9). The large
gap-like defects throughout the immature lattice are believed to
accommodate the strain from lattice curvature (10), in direct
contrast to the incorporation of pentameric units that permit
curvature in the closed mature capsid core (12–17). We further
hypothesize that the structural variability of the immature lattice
may be functionally significant for viral maturation.
Resolving the structure of multimerized Gag constructs within
immature virions and virus-like particles (VLPs) has provided
many insights into the relationship between polyprotein structure
and supramolecular assembly. Most notably, recent advances in
cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-ET have revealed an
unprecedented subnanometer resolution of Gag–Gag interfaces
(18–21). From these studies, important interactions have been
inferred from close protein–protein contacts, such as at the CACTD
helix 9 interface for dimerization and the helical CA–SP1 junction
interface for hexameric bundling. Biochemical experiments have
corroborated these findings; for example, the importance of the
SP1 domain and nearby motifs, including the major homology
region and type II β-turn, was demonstrated by the production
of aberrant virions following mutations to associated residues
Significance
In order for HIV to proliferate, viral proteins and genomic dimers
are assembled at host cell membranes and released as immature
virions. Disrupting this key intermediate step in viral replication
is a potential target for treatment. However, a detailed molec-
ular view of this process remains lacking. Here, we elucidate a
network of constitutive interactions that regulate viral assembly
dynamics through a combined computational and experimental
approach. Specifically, our analysis reveals the active roles of
nucleic acid and the membrane as scaffolds that promote the
multimerization of Gag polyprotein, which proceeds through
multistep and self-correcting nucleation. Our findings also illus-
trate the functional importance of the N-terminal, C-terminal,
and spacer peptide 1 protein domains.

 (21–23). In fact, the helical transition of the CA–SP1 junction has
been proposed as a conformational molecular switch that regulates
immature lattice assembly (21–24).
For efficient virion production, concerted interactions be-
tween Gag and both RNA and lipids in the cell membrane ap-
pear to be necessary. In vitro assembly of VLPs with immature-
like spherical geometries requires, at a minimum, Gag binding to
oligonucleotides (25, 26) or through leucine zipper motifs (27)
while binding to inositol derivatives appears to adjust particle
sizes (28). Recent studies have suggested that Gag assembly at
the cell membrane can promote selective RNA dimerization and
packaging (29, 30); competitor tRNA is also observed to posi-
tively regulate viral RNA selectivity (30). In contrast, over-
expression of nonsilencing micro-RNA is suggested to negatively
regulate viral production by impeding Gag assembly (31). The
composition of RNA within virions has also been connected to
particle size dispersity (32). Furthermore, lipid domains in the
plasma membrane may mediate Gag targeting and assembly (33–
35), while membrane curvature can initiate nucleation of
ESCRT machinery for scission (36). It is therefore clear that a
network of interactive processes between Gag, RNA, and the
plasma membrane may coordinate viral replication. Nonetheless,
the underlying mechanisms that dictate the interfacial assembly
dynamics remain unclear.
Molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations may afford insight into
the dynamics of these cellular processes. As opposed to very
computationally demanding all-atom MD simulations, coarse-
grained (CG) MD models are particularly attractive as a means
to access biological phenomena that typically occur on very large
length and timescales. Notably, understanding of the self-assembly
process for icosahedral capsids has emerged from CG MD simu-
lations of simplified capsomer subunits, in which idealized shapes
(e.g., trapezoidal, triangular, and pentagonal) can be assumed due
to the high symmetry of the closed polyhedral shell (37–44). These
studies have revealed rich phenomenology that relate capsomer
[and polyelectrolyte (42, 43)] interaction strengths, concentrations,
and temperature to the thermodynamics and kinetics of capsid
assembly. The competition between thermodynamic driving forces
and multiple kinetic pathways has consequently been shown to
result in capsid polymorphism (38–42). In principle, such insights
may be broadly applicable to other viral systems. However, only a
few CG MD studies have been reported on HIV-1 as the viral
constituents tend to be structurally and chemically complex, for
example, as demonstrated by the aforementioned network of in-
teractions, while also requiring thousands of copies of Gag for
complete virions (7, 9). For example, CG simulations have recently
predicted fundamental mechanisms in mature CA assembly (15,
17, 45, 46) and MA domain anchoring to the lipid membrane (47),
while the importance of CACTD interactions to stabilize hexameric
order in the immature virion has also been demonstrated (48).
Emerging fluorescence techniques, such as total internal re-
flection fluorescence (TIRF) and single-particle tracking pho-
toactivated localization microscopy (spt-PALM), also enable the
probing of protein mobility during live-cell imaging with high
specificity, especially in crowded and heterogeneous environ-
ments such as viral buds (49, 50). Recently, spt-PALM analysis
revealed a notable suppression in mobility for Gag clustered
within viral puncta compared with membrane-bound or cytosolic
Gag (31, 49). Hence, cooperative understanding from computer
simulations and fluorescence experiments may help elucidate
assembly dynamics at the cell membrane interface.
In this work, we present a CG computational study with our
modeling developed with the help of recent experimental
structures. We also present spt-PALM experimental data of Gag
self-assembly during the early stages of immature lattice growth.
Our intention here is to shed critical light on the network of
constituents and interactions required for viable self-assembly
and budding. First, we use CG MD simulations to investigate the
assembly of ΔCANTD–CACTD–SP1 Gag and find that nucleation
proceeds through six-helical bundling at the CACTD–SP1 junc-
tion contingent on scaffolding from RNA and the membrane. In
particular, we focus on the role of RNA through analysis of Gag
diffusion and clustering based on spt-PALM and CG MD tra-
jectories. Interestingly, these lattices, while contiguous and hex-
americ, are predicted to be flat and, hence, unlikely to instigate
budding. Next, we introduce the CANTD domain and find that
the Gag lattice exhibits an intrinsic curvature. Simulations of
these Gag constructs reveal that spontaneous curvature of the
membrane promotes efficient nucleation, while gradual mem-
brane deformation is essential for extended CA–SP1 lattice
growth. Taken together, these findings provide insight into
molecular-scale mechanisms that regulate the packaging and
budding of immature HIV-1 virions.
Results
As depicted in Fig. 1A, we have developed a CG model of the
CA–SP1 dimer that is directly derived from experimental struc-
tural data of the immature CANTD–CACTD [Protein Data Bank
(PDB) ID code 4USN (19)] and CACTD–SP1 [PDB ID code 5I4T
(21)] domains. The CG model is designed to recapitulate the in-
ternal structure of the polyprotein, relevant protein–protein in-
terfaces, and quaternary structures (Fig. 1B) through a protocol
adapted from previous work on the mature CA (17). Importantly,
the collective α-helices within each of the three protein domains
are maintained as rigid bodies (i.e., six total per dimer) with ex-
cluded volume interactions, while interdomain flexibility is main-
tained with a soft elastic network model. The dimerization is
preserved through weak harmonic bonds at the helix 9–helix 9
(H9–H9) interface in the CACTD domain. Finally, the only at-
tractive Gag–Gag interaction occurs between SP1 domains
through virtual particles that serve as binding sites (Fig. 1A). In
addition, we model RNA and the cell membrane as a linear chain
and hexagonal mesh of CG particles, respectively. Attractive in-
teractions are included between the topmost bead of the CANTD

SP1 domain and RNA to mimic MA–membrane and NC–RNA
interactions, respectively. Full details of the model are described
in Methods.
Assembly Through SP1 Helical Bundling Is Activated by RNA and
Membrane Scaffolds. We first investigate the factors that enable
self-assembly of CACTD–SP1 into an immature lattice at the
plasma membrane interface. Recent high-resolution structural
characterization has revealed that a 14-residue sequence in the
CA–SP1 junction adopts an α-helical conformation that may
mediate Gag–Gag interactions during assembly (20, 21, 24). In-
deed, mutations in this region tend to abrogate viral particle
formation (21–23). Therefore, our intention is to ascertain the
assembly competence of CACTD–SP1 as facilitated by interac-
tions at the CA–SP1 junction and the presence of both RNA and
the cell membrane.
We prepared simulations with 144 CA–SP1 dimers initially
arranged in an evenly spaced 12 × 12 grid (8.5-nm separation)
along the xy plane; final xy lengths fluctuated around 102 nm such
that the total surface coverage of Gag monomers was around
46 nmol/m2. The membrane and a 3,500-nt RNA were, re-
spectively, placed 10 nm above and 20 nm below the layer of Gag
dimers; here, the length of the RNA chain is deliberately long
enough to provide an excess of binding sites. We also maintained
membrane–CANTD interactions, which were included to implicitly
represent Gag binding to the lipid bilayer, for example, through
exposed myristyl and the MA domain; the excluded volume in-
teractions of the CANTD domain were removed to emulate its
deletion. Initially, a repulsive barrier was placed between the RNA
and CA–SP1 dimers to independently evolve disordered configu-
rations of the RNA and membrane-bound Gag over 5 × 105 CG
MD time steps (τ) at 310 K. The barrier was subsequently re-
moved and simulations were performed for 7.5 × 107 τ with tra-
jectories saved every 2.5 × 104 τ for analysis. We note that the
minimum SP1–SP1 binding strength (ESP1 = 2.35 kcal/mol) re-
quired to initiate Gag association was used for these simulations.
As seen in Fig. 2A, membrane-bound CACTD–SP1 dimers
readily self-assemble into a contiguous hexagonal lattice (e.g.,
the orientation distribution shown in the Bottom Inset of Fig. 2A
exhibits sixfold symmetry) once tethered to RNA. However, in
the absence of binding to either membrane or RNA (e.g., Top
Inset of Fig. 2A for the latter case), Gag multimerization was not
observed throughout the entirety of our simulation trajectory
(Fig. S1). This suggests that the presence of both RNA and
membrane scaffolds may be necessary for efficient immature
lattice assembly. As an additional test, we subsequently removed
both the RNA and membrane and found that the extended lat-
tice persisted indefinitely. The stability of the lattice suggests that
the CA–SP1 junction interactions are sufficient for multi-
merization while RNA and cell membranes serve as catalysts for
immature lattice assembly. One may interpret the roles of
membrane and RNA as scaffolds that restrict the diffusive de-
grees of freedom for Gag (as discussed below), encourage fa-
vorable Gag orientations for binding (as discussed in a later
section), and facilitate Gag oligomerization through increased
colocalization. By simply increasing the surface coverage of Gag
monomers to around 100 nmol/m2 (which is comparable to
lower-end surface coverages within immature virions), Gag self-
assembly is observed even in the absence of RNA (Fig. S1). In
this case, we find that the growth of the primary cluster proceeds
at a comparable rate to that of the RNA-present case, which
further suggests that these scaffolds promote contiguous as-
sembly through localized aggregation of Gag. Note that in vitro
self-assembly of Gag in solution is possible, although additional
agents such as nucleic acid or inositol derivatives are necessary to
efficiently grow VLPs with spherical morphologies (25, 26, 28).
Remarkably, the assembled lattice derived from our simple CG
model is predicted to preserve a high degree of crystallinity. The
lattice tends to be completely planar, which is in good agreement
with the observed flat assemblies from purified CACTD–SP1 pro-
teins (21). To characterize the crystallinity, we computed a 2D
(e.g., in-plane) pair distribution function [gdimer(r)] for the dimer
center of mass, which is shown in Fig. 2B. The observation of
distinct peaks is indicative of crystallinity; by contrast, the gdimer(r)
in the absence of RNA gradually increases toward unity, which
indicates the absence of an ordered structure. Given that the re-
peating unit in the lattice is composed of six subunits of CA–
SP1 dimers, the lattice constant can be approximated from the
position of the third gdimer(r) peak (refer to Fig. S2). Our calcu-
lated lattice spacing of 7.4 nm, which is in excellent agree-
ment with previous cryo-EM studies of tubular Gag constructs
(∼7.25 nm) (18), and reproduction of hexagonal symmetry further
support the validity of our CG model.
Visualization of the simulation trajectories (Movie S1) reveals
that extended Gag oligomerization proceeds through a multi-
stage process. Interestingly, Gag polyproteins continuously un-
dergo cyclical association and dissociation behavior until a
hexamer is formed (Fig. S1). In turn, these hexamers remain
associated indefinitely. Hence, the extended lattice grows from
both the nucleation of additional hexamers around a stable
hexamer and the assimilation of hexamer-containing oligomers.

 Complementary evidence is provided by the time series profile
(i.e., gray line) of the number of Gag (nGag) within hexamers
shown in Fig. 2C; here, nGag evolves in a stepwise and mono-
tonically increasing fashion. Similarly, fluorescence studies have
suggested that Gag recruitment at membrane puncta is irre-
versible once complete (51). The preferential stability of hex-
amers points to its importance as a building block of the
immature lattice, which we will discuss further in a later section.
While viral RNA seems to orchestrate Gag multimerization,
the influence of nonviral RNA on the self-assembly process re-
mains an open question. Nonsilencing micro-RNAs (miRNAs)
are particularly interesting as a previous study (31) demonstrated
their negative regulatory effect on viral infectivity. We proceeded
to include short (20-nt) RNA into the CG model to represent
typical nonsilencing miRNA lengths [20–25 nt (52)] and re-
peated the same simulation procedure as above. Here, we as-
sume no differences between the Gag binding affinities of the
viral RNA and miRNA. Hence, the length and concentration of
the two RNA species are the only distinctions; the miRNA re-
mains sufficiently long to bind to multiple diffuse Gag (around
1–3) and across Gag hexamers. The time series profiles of nGag
for varying concentrations of miRNA are shown in Fig. 2C. In-
terestingly, the profiles for small concentrations of miRNA (less
than a ratio of 200:288:1 miRNA:Gag:RNA) remain consistently
above the shaded region, which indicates that the rate of Gag
oligomerization is enhanced compared with the miRNA-absent
case. These miRNA appear to aid in the initial nucleation of
hexamers and other small oligomers. Throughout assembly,
these miRNA-tethered oligomers are condensed into the largest
cluster that is organized primarily by the viral RNA (Fig. S3),
which then anneal as dissociated Gag dimers remain available.
However, beyond a critical concentration of miRNA (more than
a ratio of 1,500:288:1), lattice assembly appears virtually stag-
nant. Our trajectories show that miRNA-bound Gag impede
viral RNA binding through competitive inhibition (Fig. S3),
thereby preventing the tethering activity of viral RNA.
Our CG simulation results are supported by evidence from spt-
PALM. We are specifically interested in changes to the diffusive
behavior of Gag under different RNA environments since these
can manifest due to changes in the multimerized Gag cluster size.
We prepared wild-type (WT) and miRNA-overexpressing (has-
miR-146a with 22 nt) HEK293 cells transfected with a full-length
HIV-1 proviral clone and its derivative tagged with mEOS2, which
were expressed in a 3:1 ratio to ensure viral particle formation
(Methods). To remove RNA influence on Gag multimerization
(53–55), WT cell lines with NC-deleted Gag (ΔNC) mutants were
similarly prepared. Fig. 3A displays the distribution of Gag diffu-
sivities (D) from the WT, miRNA, and ΔNC lines with calculated
mean values of 0.092, 0.144, and 0.438 μm2/s, respectively. Simi-
larly, a distribution of D for multimerized Gag and diffuse Gag
dimers as computed from our CG MD simulations are shown in
Fig. 3B with calculated mean values of 570 and 2,950 μm2/s, re-
spectively. We normalize these two distributions to establish a
basis for comparison to account for the well-known separation
between CG and real-time dynamics (56, 57); although the CG
dynamics are several orders of magnitude faster than reality, the
relative ratio of the mean D for ΔNC to WT lines (∼4.8) is
comparable to that of CG predictions for oligomerized to diffuse
Gag (∼5.2). It is also notable that the distributions of D for the
WT and miRNA Gag (Fig. 3A) and that of oligomerized Gag (Fig.
3B) exhibit a qualitatively similar preference for slow D (<25% of
the mean) while the distributions of both ΔNC and diffuse Gag
show comparably broad (i.e., heavy-tail) behavior. These shared
features indirectly suggest that Gag can oligomerize in both
miRNA-rich and miRNA-absent environments, while ΔNC-Gag
expectedly remain largely dissociated.
We next used PALM cluster analysis (Methods) to quantify the
distribution of Gag cluster sizes in the WT and miRNA lines.
The distributions shown in Fig. 3C confirm that Gag can form
tightly clustered regions in both WT and miRNA lines. However,
it is apparent that Gag in WT lines tend to form much larger
clusters (approaching 150 nm) compared with miRNA lines.
Therefore, our combined simulation and experimental results
suggest that, while viral RNA instigates Gag multimerization, an
excess of miRNA can limit the extent of multimerization and
thereby reduce viral particle production (31).
Weak Gag–Gag Interaction Strength Regulates Against Kinetic Trapping.
To this point, we have established that CACTD–SP1 is assembly
competent and nucleates through six-helical bundling at the
CA–SP1 junction interface. Importantly, RNA and the plasma
membrane also appear to catalyze assembly, which may be a
consequence of the weak protein–protein interactions. We next
sought to determine whether this inherent interaction strength
is important for successful assembly by modulating ESP1 (i.e.,
the junction binding affinity). First, it is informative to analyze
the stability of different Gag oligomers, each observed during
general assembly, as ESP1 is adjusted. To do so, we approximate the
probability (foligomer) that each of four representative oligomers—a
hexamer of dimers (HOD), a closed trimer of dimers (TOD), a

 chain of TODs, and a crescent fan of TODs (depicted in Fig.
4A)—resists dissociation due to thermal fluctuations at 310 K
within a constant period of time (e.g., 1 × 106 τ); larger foligomer
values imply greater kinetic stability and longer lifetimes. For
each type of oligomer, we initialized systems of evenly spaced
5 × 5 × 5 CA–SP1 oligomers separated by 25 nm in all direc-
tions within a 125 × 125 × 125-nm3 simulation domain. Simu-
lations were performed in the canonical ensemble (constant
NVT) over production runs of 1 × 106 τ with trajectories saved
every 2.5 × 104 τ for analysis. The reported foligomer is averaged
over four independent trajectories for each ESP1 that is varied
between 1.5 and 4.5 kcal/mol.
Fig. 4B shows the foligomer profiles for each oligomer type as a
function of ESP1. In every case, a sigmoidal profile was obtained in
which below (above) a certain ESP1, all oligomers spontaneously
dissociated (remained associated) while both associated and dis-
sociated states existed in the intermediate ESP1 regime (i.e., near
the inflection point); we should note that the previously used ESP1
(=2.35 kcal/mol) is within the intermediate regime for HODs. We
find that HODs are considerably more kinetically stable than
closed TODs, which in turn are more stable than the open forms
of TODs (i.e., chain and crescent forms); note that the tethering of
small RNA (20 nt) to each oligomer yielded comparable foligomer
profiles. Additional discussion on the factors contributing to
oligomer stability can be found in Supporting Information. The
preferential stability (i.e., lifetime) of HODs over other oligomers
is notable as it further supports the idea of the aforementioned
multistage nucleation process in which individual HODs must first
assemble through helical bundling at the CA–SP1 junction before
the extended lattice is grown; the growth proceeds in a cascading
fashion, either from additional HODs nucleating on the edges of
the initial HOD or from assimilation of independently formed
HODs (Movie S1).
Next, we investigate the impact of increasing ESP1 to 2.7 and
4.0 kcal/mol, which should increase the stability of closed and
open TODs (Fig. 4B). As depicted in Fig. 4C, the resultant lat-
tice growth exhibits notable anisotropy. This dendritic growth
can be attributed to the increased stability of oligomers at the
edges of the lattice, which in turn present additional nucleating
sites for CA–SP1 consolidation. Furthermore, the degree of
anisotropy appears to scale directly with increasing oligomer
stability (e.g., the ESP1 = 4.0 kcal/mol case), while concurrently
mitigating the necessity of RNA to promote CA–SP1 association.
Vacancy-like defects (i.e., incomplete hexamers) can also form
throughout the lattice (Fig. 4C, Insets). These defects likely arise
due to the extended lifetime of nonhexameric oligomers that are
subsequently incorporated as kinetically frustrated configura-
tions. Therefore, unlike our previous simulations (i.e., ESP1 =
2.35 kcal/mol), the absence of a self-regulating mechanism to
heal lattice defects through cyclic CA–SP1 association and dis-
sociation can result in locally defective immature lattices.

Occlusion. In this section, we describe the impact of the CANTD
domain on the structure of the immature CA–SP1 lattice. First, we
reexamine the kinetic stability of CA–SP1 oligomers once the
explicit volume occupied by the CANTD domain is introduced. The
foligomer profiles depicted in Fig. 5A exhibit sigmoidal profiles
similar to that of the CACTD–SP1 cases (Fig. 4B). Importantly, the
CANTD–CACTD–SP1 profiles are shifted to the right (e.g., the
inflection point of each profile is higher by as much as 0.3 kcal/mol)
in comparison with the previous CACTD–SP1 cases. This indicates that
the steric occlusion by the globular CANTD region tends to destabilize
each oligomer. The volume occupied by the CANTD domain has an
important influence on the immature lattice structure. We assembled
a hexameric lattice of CANTD–CACTD–SP1 (described in a later sec-
tion) and computed gdimer(r) profiles between the center of masses of
the CACTD domains and the CANTD domains for comparison. From
Fig. 5B, the sharp peaks associated with the CACTD and CANTD
layers are indicative of crystallinity. However, one notable differ-
ence is their respective lattice spacings, that is, the position of their
third peaks; the CACTD sublattice (∼7.7 nm) is more tightly packed
than the CANTD sublattice (∼8.5 nm). Given that the lattice
spacing of the CACTD domain is reduced to around 7.4 nm when
the CANTD domain is deleted, these results indicate that the space
filled by the CANTD domain introduces lateral strain to the as-
sembled complex. As the two domains are connected, this strain
has the important consequence of introducing an inherent lattice
curvature. Following the geometric relationship depicted in Fig.
5C, we approximate the natural radius of curvature (rcurv) to be
39.6 ± 1.3 nm. For comparison, experimental VLPs constructed
with ΔMA–Gag can have radii as small as 40–45 nm (58, 59), while
WT virions, which are composed of full-length Gag proteins, typ-
ically have larger radii that vary between 50 and 100 nm (7, 9, 11).
Spontaneous Membrane Curvature Triggers Extended Assembly.
Surprisingly, we found that CANTD–CACTD–SP1 dimers remained
largely dissociated when following our previous simulation pro-
cedure (with ESP1 = 2.6 kcal/mol). This remained true even when
ESP1 was enhanced to 3.5 kcal/mol in an attempt to promote as-
sembly (Fig. S4); although small oligomers readily formed, extended
assembly was not observed. We attribute the impeded assembly to
Fig. 4.
Weak interactions ensure preferential oligomerization into hexamers.

 the competition between the natural curvature of the CA–
SP1 lattice and the resistance to curvature from the membrane.
In other words, our simulations suggest that the weak binding
affinity between Gag–Gag and membrane–Gag may be in-
sufficient to overcome the free-energy penalty for membrane
bending. As a result, the misalignment in the binding interface of
adjacent CA–SP1 helical junction may be conceived as an addi-
tional entropic barrier. Nonetheless, we found that inducing lo-
calized curvature (i.e., small punctas) on the membrane, for
example, from lateral phase segregation of lipids or membrane
rafts (60, 61), allowed extended lattice formation to proceed. To
further investigate the influence of spontaneous membrane cur-
vature, we instigated local puncta of variable size with a weakly
repulsive spherical potential (Methods) that was slowly pushed
(over 5 × 106 τ) into the membrane with 64 bound dimers and
without RNA (with lateral dimensions of 70 × 70 nm2); we limited
system sizes to study a wide range of puncta heights (with respect
to the base of the membrane) and radii of curvature. Then, a
2,500-nt chain of RNA was introduced and the systems were
allowed to equilibrate for 1.5 × 108 τ at 310 K; it is notable that
simulations required much longer trajectories than the CACTD–SP1
cases as the CANTD domain introduces additional barriers associ-
ated with reorganization that slow HOD formation.
Fig. 6 summarizes the results of our simulations for CANTD–
CACTD–SP1 assembly as a function of puncta height and radius of
curvature. Here, Gag self-assembly proceeds at the center of the
domain where the membrane puncta is located. Interestingly, the
efficiency of Gag association, as characterized by the total number
of completed hexamers at the end of our simulations, appears to
be sensitive to both the height and curvature of the puncta. It is
intuitive that the final number of hexamers increases with height
as the available surface area of the deformed region also increases.
However, unexpectedly, an optimal radius of curvature also ap-
pears at each discrete height, decreasing from around 52.5 to
47.5 nm as the height increases from 2.5 to 7.5 nm. In instances
both above and below this critical radius, Gag multimerization
appears to be hindered. These results suggest that the alignment
between local membrane and intrinsic Gag curvature becomes
increasingly important as the lattice grows to promote Gag binding
onto the cluster periphery. Time-series profiles of hexamer for-
mation (Fig. S5) suggest that the rate of lattice assembly follows a
qualitatively similar trend. We therefore speculate that the extent
of lattice growth is coupled to the dynamics of membrane de-
formation (i.e., bud formation).
To emulate initial budding, we performed a nonequilibrium
MD simulation (Movie S2) of 144 dimers with RNA and a grad-
ually deforming membrane (initial lateral domain size of 100 ×
100 nm2) over 2 × 108 τ. We monotonically increased the height
and radius of curvature of the puncta following the time series
profiles shown in Fig. 7A. Fig. 7B presents nGag profiles according
to three classifications: (i) total oligomerized, (ii) within the
largest contiguous cluster, and (iii) within complete hexamers.
Throughout the trajectory, we observe relatively rapid binding and
unbinding of Gag, reined in by RNA, to the central multimerized
cluster to complete hexamers at the lattice periphery (Fig. 7C).
Meanwhile, hexamer creation increases monotonically, which is
consistent with our observations from TIRF experiments (Fig. S6);
note that the actual time required for hexamer formation can vary
widely as evidenced by the plateaus in the hexamerized nGag
profile. Analysis of the dynamic rate of membrane deformation
and Gag lattice growth (Fig. S7) further suggests that, while the
extent of Gag aggregation is proportional to the rate of membrane
deformation,
hexamer
formation
rates
remain
largely
in-
dependent. The snapshots in Fig. 7C also show that the lattice
grows isotropically such that hexamer formation mostly occurs in
concentric layers around the center of the cluster. We can expect
this behavior since the entropic burden for hexamer formation
(through concerted Gag localization) is reduced for every adjacent
hexamer, which provide tethered monomers for hexamer in-
corporation; the extent to which this isotropic growth persists as
the lattice approaches virion-scale sizes remains an open question.
Altogether, our simulations suggest that slow and self-correcting
Gag assembly concurrent with gradual membrane deformation
may be essential features of immature lattice growth.
Discussion
We have developed a CG computational model from experi-
mental structural data that recapitulates assembly of HIV-1 im-
mature lattices having contiguous and hexameric structures, in
general agreement with previous cryo-EM and cryo-ET experi-
ments (7–11). Our joint CG MD simulations and spt-PALM ex-
periments support recent fluorescence experiments (51, 62–64)
that suggested Gag multimerization occurs at the cell membrane
interface rather than through the delivery of small Gag oligomers
preassembled within the cytoplasm. Importantly, we highlight the
catalytic role of both membrane puncta and viral RNA to drive
multimerization. Our simulations indicate that assembly proceeds
through a slow, self-regulated, and multistage process in which
Gag hexamers are gradually formed along the periphery of a
growing cluster; the multistep nature of this assembly process may
contribute to the pauses that have been observed during viral
Fig. 5.

tion distance (Δh) between domains. Our calculations estimate rcurv to be
39.6 ± 1.3 nm.

 assembly (65). We should emphasize that our CG model is in-
tentionally simplified to reconstitute the minimal features required
for assembly and may not be directly comparable to the complex
ecosystem within cells. As a result, some possible mechanistic
nuances, such as molecular conformational switches (21, 22, 24,
30) or regulatory signals from viral RNA-specific sequences and
structures (66–70), are not included at this juncture in the mod-
eling. Nonetheless, the simplicity of the present CG model pro-
vides a platform to distinguish possible regulatory roles of Gag
protein domains, RNA, and the cell membrane on the early stages
of immature lattice assembly.
The immature lattice consists of hexagonally arranged building
blocks which themselves are hexamers of Gag. Therefore, suc-
cessful assembly is contingent on controlled hexagonal order
both within the hexameric unit and throughout the extended
lattice. Our simulations show that anisotropic attractive inter-
actions at the helical CA–SP1 junction, which may arise from
interactions between hydrophobic sidechains (21) that emerge
due to the amphipathic character of the helix (22), can provide
hexagonal order within the hexameric unit through six-helical
bundling. The inherent weakness of this interaction may be sig-
nificant for two reasons. First, hexamers are preferentially stable
over other small oligomers, which subsequently allows nonideal
oligomers to anneal into proper hexamers. Second, hexamer
formation requires concerted localization and reorganization of
Gag, which can be facilitated by the RNA scaffold that, in part,
makes RNA indispensable (and ensures that RNA is packaged).
Our predicted requirement for weak interprotein interactions to
prevent kinetically frustrated assembly is also consistent with
computational studies of icosahedral capsid assembly (38, 40–42,
71), but further suggests that only a subset of protein interfaces is
needed to mediate assembly. Hence, based on our simulation
results, we also hypothesize that enhancing the interactions at
the CA–SP1 helical interface can either induce aberrant Gag
multimerization or abolish RNA packaging requirements; for
example, A366E and M367K mutations exhibit Gag localization
on the plasma membrane (i.e., arrested virion release) or non-
spherical virion phenotypes (22), which may be interpreted based
on additional electrostatic attraction at the helical junction. In
other words, perturbing the narrow window of weak interactions
at the CA–SP1 junction, either through diminishing or height-
ening, may be a viable therapeutic target to disrupt immature
virion production.
Once the formation of the initial hexamer unit is complete,
additional hexamers nucleate in concentric rings around this seed.
Our results suggest that this process is enabled by both Gag di-
merization and Gag recruitment driven by RNA. Recall that Gag
dimerization, which occurs through the H9–H9 interface in the
CACTD domain, is preferred in the cytoplasm (72), although the
relative orientation of these helices differs in mature CA dimers
and lattices (18, 73–75). Hence, hexamer formation utilizes six
distinct dimers but only one-half of each; the other half of each
dimer remains flexibly bound on each of six facets. These dangling
dimers serve as a nucleating template by reducing the number of
Gag that must be recruited through RNA scaffolding; as a result,
the immature lattice can expand in a largely contiguous fashion (8,
9). Based on our findings, we suggest that efficient particle release
may require RNA that is sufficiently long to continuously recruit
free Gag into the lattice. Previous experiments have demonstrated

 that viral RNA as short as 3 kb can generate viral particles (76),
although the efficacy of much shorter RNA remains to be ex-
plored. Our joint experiments and simulations on ultrashort
(20-nt) miRNA, and related observations from previous experi-
ments using miRNA (31) and tRNA (30), suggest that an excess of
short competitor RNA can negatively regulate the ability of viral
RNA to orchestrate Gag multimerization by restricting the avail-
ability of Gag–RNA binding sites.
The dynamics of membrane deformation during budding ap-
pear to further regulate the assembly process. This is related to
our finding that the CANTD domain imparts intrinsic curvature to
the immature lattice. There has been some debate on the role and
relevance of the CANTD domain since ΔCANTD Gag has been
reported to successfully produce VLPs (27, 59), remain aggregated
at the plasma membrane (77), or assemble into flat sheets in vitro
(21). Our findings show that both CANTD–Gag and ΔCANTD–Gag
are assembly competent, but the former may require spontaneous
membrane curvature to initiate nucleation while extended growth
is contingent on gradual membrane deformation. Beyond simple
thermal fluctuations, curvature may be passively promoted by the
heterogeneous compositions of membranes, such as through lipid
raft domains (44, 78, 79) or transmembrane proteins (80–82). In
fact, the binding of MA domains (and associated myristyl anchors)
to the membrane may be important to initiate PIP2 enrichment
into nanodomains (47, 83) and possibly membrane bending. In
addition, the actin cytoskeleton has been proposed to expedite
viral assembly and budding (84), although its role is dispensable as
shown by recent fluorescence experiments (85, 86). We further
speculate that membrane deformation dynamics can influence the
formation of previously observed defects throughout the imma-
ture lattice (8–10), especially since immature virions tend to be
highly pleomorphic. While local hexameric defects may be similar
to the vacancy-like defects observed in this work, extended gap-
like defects might also arise from anisotropic lattice growth at the
leading edges, which might be instigated by the strain imposed
from the mismatch between the local curvature of the Gag lattice
and membrane. Hence, the presence of these possible curvature
generation factors is likely important to understand differences in
observed virion phenotypes, which may be a future direction for
study. Beyond incorporation of these potential factors, computa-
tional challenges remain for virion-scale assembly and budding.
Given that immature virions are composed of an average of 2,400
Gag (9), the increased system sizes and anticipated trajectory
lengths would make CG simulations (in the mold of this work)
exceptionally expensive. Nonetheless, we are encouraged by the
rapid development of enhanced sampling techniques such as
metadynamics (87), which we foresee as one promising approach
for future simulations in this direction.
To summarize, our findings reveal that RNA and the cell
membrane are active participants of viral assembly that both ini-
tiate and coordinate Gag multimerization. Deformations along the
membrane can regulate the location and size of the assembling
Gag cluster, which can only proceed when RNA drives the local-
ization and reorganization of multiple free Gag toward the cluster
periphery. Our results suggest that immature lattice assembly and
budding are coupled and proceed concurrently (88). These insights
reveal a network of coordinated interactions that are likely to be
essential for viral replication.
Methods
CA–SP1 CG Model. To reproduce the internal structure of the CA–SP1 dimer,
we only considered the structured portions within each protein domain. As
depicted in Fig. 1A, the relative position of each CG site was obtained from
the average position of each C-α throughout the α-helices within the CANTD
(seven helices), CACTD (four helices), and SP1 (one helix) domains, which were
calculated over all monomer chain configurations. We used two experi-
mental datasets [PDB ID codes 4USN (19) and 5I4T (21)] that were super-
posed by minimizing the root-mean-squared deviation of the C-α positions
in the CACTD domain. As NMR spectroscopy has suggested that each protein
domain remains folded in solution and reorients semiindependently from
each other (72), the collection of α-helices within each domain was consid-
ered as a rigid body with rigid-body dynamics (89). The tertiary structure of
CA–SP1 was maintained with an elastic network model (ENM) that con-
nected CG particles in adjacent domains (e.g., between helix 10 of CACTD and
the SP1 helix) through flexible harmonic bonds; the potential energy of the
bonds (Ebond) was given by the following:
Ebond = Kbondðr − r0Þ2,
where Kbond = 0.5 kcal·mol−1·Å−2, r is the separation distance, and r0 is the
computed average distance. To maintain the shape of the polyprotein, each
CG particle had an excluded volume through a soft cosine potential (Eexcl)
given by the following:
Eexcl = A½1 + cosðπr=rexclÞ�,
when r < rexcl. The excluded volume separation (rexcl) between CG particles in
adjacent helices was set to their average separation distances if less than
10 Å or, otherwise, set to 10 Å (i.e., CG particle radii are 5 Å by default); in all
cases, A = 25 kcal/mol. The mass of every CG site was set to 150 Da.
The CG model also incorporated two important protein–protein interfaces
that have previously been identified. First, we used a flexible ENM (Kbond =
0.05 kcal·mol−1·Å−2) between adjacent H9 in the CACTD domains to dimerize
CA–SP1 based on the helical orientations observed in the aforementioned
experimental data sets; our ENM represents the strong preference for CA
proteins to exist as homodimers in the cytoplasm (72, 75), although the
relative tilt between H9 can vary (73, 74). In addition, we assume that the
CA–SP1 junction forms an ordered helix that assembles into a high-density
bundle (8, 10, 18–21). To recapitulate this interface, we used the relative
positions of four residues (P356, A360, A364, S368) in an adjacent
SP1 domain when confined within a hexamer configuration to assign the
positions of virtual particles (pink spheres in Fig. 1A); as a result, each CG
monomer consisted of 157 residue beads and four virtual particles (a total of
161 CG beads per monomer). Each of these virtual particles were allowed to
tether to any CG particle of the same residue through an attractive Gaussian
potential (Etether) given by the following:
Etether = −ESP1 exp
�
−Br2�
,
where ESP1 is the well depth (varied throughout this manuscript), B is the
inverse interaction range (=0.2 Å−2), and r is the distance between the vir-
tual and tether site. This interaction was the only attractive nonbonding
interaction between CA–SP1 dimers used throughout this work and effec-
tively represents the net contributions from the SP1 helical interactions, the
major homology region, and the nearby type II β-turn (19–21).
By combining the excluded volume and structural ENM throughout the
CA–SP1 polyprotein, the flexible ENM at the H9–H9 dimer interface, and
the anisotropic tethering potential at the CA–SP1 junction, the tertiary and
quaternary structure of assembled CA–SP1 recapitulated the expected hex-
amer structure (Fig. 1B).
RNA and Membrane Model. Simplified CG models of RNA and the membrane
were used throughout this work. RNA was represented as a linear chain of CG
particles that were linked with flexible harmonic bonds (Kbond = 0.5 kcal·mol−1·Å−2;
see Ebond above) and excluded volume with rexcl = 7.0 Å (i.e., particle radius
of 3.5 Å; see Eexcl above). The mass of each CG site was set to 330 Da. To
implicitly include binding between RNA and the NC domain, each RNA
particle was allowed to tether to the final SP1 particle with a well depth of
7.5 kcal/mol and inverse interaction range of 0.1 Å−2; as this interaction is, in
part, due to electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged phos-
phate groups in RNA and positively charged Zn2+ fingers in the NC domain
(66, 90), the chosen potential energy is intentionally both stronger and
wider-ranged than that of the hydrophobic SP1–SP1 interaction (21, 22).
The simplified membrane was represented by an elastic mesh of particles
(with a mass of 1 kDa) arranged in a hexagonal lattice with a lattice constant
of 0.85 nm. Bonds between particles are maintained with a Morse potential
(Emorse) given by the following:
Emorse = D½1 − expð−αðr − rEMÞÞ�2,
where D = 450.0 kcal/mol, α = 0.17 Å−1, and rEM = 5.0 Å; each particle
was connected to their three neighbors. Particles also interacted through a
long-range 12-6 Lennard Jones potential with a modified soft core (Esclj) (91)
given by the following:

where n = 2, αLJ = 0.5, λ = 0.6, « = 0.03 kcal/mol, and σ = 20 Å. These two
potentials, at minimum, were found to stabilize membrane planarity even
without angular or dihedral terms. These parameters have been adjusted to
reproduce a fluctuation spectrum (Fig. S8) with bending modulus of around
12 kBT (92). Our intention was simply to emulate the membrane as a sub-
strate that reduces the dimensionality of CA–SP1 assembly (44). To implicitly
include binding between the membrane and Gag through exposed myristyl
and the MA domain (93, 94), each elastic mesh particle interacted with the
top-most particle of the CANTD domain (i.e., in helix 6, which is furthest from
the CA–SP1 junction) through Esclj, where n = 2, αLJ = 0.5, λ = 0.6, « = 1.5 kcal/mol,
and σ = 12 Å; note that weaker interaction strengths prevent Gag binding,
while stronger interaction strengths prevent extended lattice growth (Fig.
S4). In addition, spontaneous curvature in the membrane was induced
through a spherical indentation force (Find) given by the following:
Find = Kindðr − RindÞ2,
where Kind = 0.001 kcal·mol−1·Å−3 and Rind is the radius of the indenter; the
force is repulsive when r < Rind and zero otherwise. In these cases, an op-
posing planar force (Kind = 0.0001 kcal·mol−1·Å−3) was weakly applied to the
outermost edges of the mesh (with thickness around 15 Å) to prevent
vertical drift.
Unless otherwise specified, default excluded volume interactions (e.g.,
radius of 5 Å) were maintained between CA–SP1, RNA, and the membrane.
MD Simulations. All CG MD simulations were performed using the large-scale
atomic/molecular massively parallel simulator (LAMMPS) (95). Three different
classes of simulations were performed throughout this manuscript; the general
details of each are described below. In all cases, a temperature of 310 K was
maintained using Langevin dynamics (96) with a damping constant of 100 ps.
A Nosé–Hoover chain barostat (97, 98) in the coupled xy (i.e., lateral) dimen-
sions was used to maintain zero tension with a damping constant of 250 ps,
unless otherwise specified. A CG MD time step (τ) of 200 fs was used; we chose
the largest τ that was possible without noticeable energy drift in the micro-
canonical (constant NVE) ensemble. All pair potentials used a 25-Å radial
cutoff with an additional 5-Å buffer for particle neighbor lists. All simulations
were periodic in all three directions, although in all cases, unless otherwise
specified, the z direction was bound by repulsive walls and essentially non-
periodic. Several different simulations were performed throughout this man-
uscript; specific details are described within the appropriate subsections in
Results. All simulations were executed on either 64 or 96 AMD Bulldozer CPUs
(2.3 GHz) with execution speeds around 1.2 × 107 and 1.7 × 107 τ/d, re-
spectively. Further details on trajectory analysis are provided in SI Methods.
Preparation of Cells and Plasmids. WT HEK293 cells and HEK293 cells over-
expressing exogenous human miRNA has–miR–146a were cultured and
maintained in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS
(Invitrogen) and 2 mM glutamine (Cellgro). Designs of miRNA expression
plasmids and viral constructs used for expressing Gag (pNL4-3ΔPΔE, pNL4-3-
imEOS2-ΔPΔE, and pNL4-3-iEGFP-ΔPΔE) and generation of miRNA cell line
have been described before (31).
PALM Imaging. Live-cell spt-PALM experiments were carried out with an Elyra
PS.1 using a 100×, 1.46 N.A. oil-immersion objective (Carl Zeiss). Cells were
plated in cleaned 25-mm #1.5 coverslips (Warner Instruments) and trans-
fected with pNL4-3ΔPΔE and pNL4-3-imEOS2-ΔPΔE plasmids as described
before (31). Live-cell spt-PALM experiments (31, 49) were performed with
cells placed in imaging medium (phenol red-free DMEM containing 25 mM
Hepes and 1% FBS) maintained at 37 °C. During PALM image acquisition,
mEOS2 probes were photoconverted using a 561-nm laser (readout-induced
activation mode), and images were collected at 20 frames per s. The 561-nm
laser power was calibrated to maintain a sparse distribution of single
mEOS2 fluorescent spots at every image frame of the time series.
PALM images of live cells were collected using illumination conditions where
the average distance between single-molecule fluorescent spots was signifi-
cantly larger than the localization precision of single Gag molecules. Single
mEOS2-tagged Gag molecules were identified and fit with a 2D symmetric
Gaussian point spread function using either commercially available software
(Zeiss Zen Black super resolution module; Carl Zeiss) or custom code written in
MATLAB. Further details on PALM image analysis are provided in SI Methods.
