FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION 
1 
INDICATIONS AND USAGE 
ALIQOPA is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed follicular lymphoma (FL) who have 
received at least two prior systemic therapies.  
Accelerated approval was granted for this indication based on overall response rate [see Clinical Studies 
(14.1)]. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of 
clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. 
 
2 
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  
2.1 
Recommended Dosage 
The recommended dose of ALIQOPA is 60 mg administered as a 1-hour intravenous infusion on Days 1, 8, 
and 15 of a 28-day treatment cycle on an intermittent schedule (three weeks on and one week off). Continue 
treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. 
2.2 
Preparation and Administration  
For intravenous infusion only. 
Administer ALIQOPA as a single agent, following reconstitution and dilution. Mix only with 0.9% sodium 
chloride (NaCl) solution. Do not mix or inject ALIQOPA with other drugs or other diluents.  
2.3 
Reconstitution Instructions 
Reconstitute ALIQOPA with 4.4 mL of sterile 0.9% NaCl solution leading to a concentration of 15 mg/mL.  
 Withdraw 4.4 mL of sterile 0.9% NaCl solution by using a 5 mL sterile syringe with needle. 
 Inject the measured volume through the disinfected stopper surface into the vial of ALIQOPA. 
 Dissolve the lyophilized solid by gently shaking the injection vial for 30 seconds. 
 Allow to stand for one minute to let bubbles rise to the surface. 
 Check if any undissolved substance is still seen. If yes, repeat the gentle shaking and settling 
procedure.  
 Inspect visually for discoloration and particulate matter. After reconstitution, the solution should be 
colorless to slightly yellowish.  
 Once the solution is free of visible particles, withdraw the reconstituted solution for further dilution.  
2.4 
Dilution Instructions for Intravenous Use 
Further dilute the reconstituted solution in 100 mL sterile 0.9% NaCl solution for injection. With a sterile 
syringe, withdraw the required amount of the reconstituted solution for the desired dosage:   
60 mg: Withdraw 4 mL of the reconstituted solution with a sterile syringe. 
45 mg: Withdraw 3 mL of the reconstituted solution with a sterile syringe. 
30 mg: Withdraw 2 mL of the reconstituted solution with a sterile syringe. 
Inject the contents of the syringe into the patient infusion bag of 100 mL sterile 0.9% NaCl solution. Mix the 
dose well by inverting. 
Discard any unused reconstituted or diluted solution appropriately. 
Use reconstituted and diluted ALIQOPA immediately or store the reconstituted solution in the vial or diluted 
solution in the infusion bag at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) for up to 24 hours before use. Allow the product to 
adapt to room temperature before use following refrigeration. Avoid exposure of the diluted solution to 
direct sunlight.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  
5.1 
Infections 
Serious, including fatal, infections occurred in 19% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy. 
The most common serious infection was pneumonia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor patients for 
Reference ID: 4152629
 6 
 
signs and symptoms of infection and withhold ALIQOPA for Grade 3 and higher infection [see Dosage and 
Administration (2.5)]. 
Serious pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP) occurred in 0.6% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA 
monotherapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Before initiating treatment with ALIQOPA, consider PJP 
prophylaxis for populations at risk. Withhold ALIQOPA in patients with suspected PJP infection of any 
grade. If confirmed, treat infection until resolution, then resume ALIQOPA at previous dose with 
concomitant PJP prophylaxis [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. 
5.2  Hyperglycemia 
Grade 3 or 4 hyperglycemia (blood glucose 250 mg/dL or greater) occurred in 41% of 317 patients treated 
with ALIQOPA monotherapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Serious hyperglycemic events occurred in 2.8% 
of patients. Treatment with ALIQOPA may result in infusion-related hyperglycemia. Blood glucose levels 
typically peaked 5 to 8 hours post-infusion and subsequently declined to baseline levels for a majority of 
patients; blood glucose levels remained elevated in 17.7% of patients one day after ALIQOPA infusion. Of 
155 patients with baseline HbA1c <5.7%, 16 (10%) patients had HbA1c >6.5% at the end of treatment.  
Of the twenty patients with diabetes mellitus treated in CHRONOS-1, seven developed Grade 4 
hyperglycemia and two discontinued treatment. Patients with diabetes mellitus should only be treated with 
ALIQOPA following adequate glucose control and should be monitored closely. 
Achieve optimal blood glucose control before starting each ALIQOPA infusion. Withhold, reduce dose, or 
discontinue ALIQOPA depending on the severity and persistence of hyperglycemia [see Dosage and 
Administration (2.5)]. 
5.3 
Hypertension 
Grade 3 hypertension (systolic 160 mmHg or greater or diastolic 100 mmHg or greater) occurred in 26% of 
317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Serious hypertensive 
events occurred in 0.9% of 317 patients. Treatment with ALIQOPA may result in infusion-related 
hypertension. The mean change of systolic and diastolic BP from baseline to 2 hours post-infusion on Cycle 
1 Day 1 was 16.8 mmHg and 7.8 mmHg, respectively. The mean BP started decreasing approximately 2 
hours post-infusion; BP remained elevated for 6 to 8 hours after the start of the ALIQOPA infusion. Optimal 
BP control should be achieved before starting each ALIQOPA infusion. Monitor BP pre- and post-infusion. 
Withhold, reduce dose, or discontinue ALIQOPA depending on the severity and persistence of hypertension 
[see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. 
5.4 
Non-Infectious Pneumonitis 
Non-infectious pneumonitis occurred in 5% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy [see 
Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Withhold ALIQOPA and conduct a diagnostic examination of a patient who is 
experiencing pulmonary symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, hypoxia, or interstitial infiltrates on radiologic 
exam. Patients with pneumonitis thought to be caused by ALIQOPA have been managed by withholding 
ALIQOPA and administration of systemic corticosteroids. Withhold, reduce dose, or discontinue ALIQOPA 
depending on the severity and persistence of non-infectious pneumonitis [see Dosage and Administration 
(2.5)]. 
5.5 
Neutropenia 
Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 24% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA monotherapy. Serious 
neutropenic events occurred in 1.3% [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Monitor blood counts at least weekly 
during treatment with ALIQOPA. Withhold, reduce dose, or discontinue ALIQOPA depending on the 
severity and persistence of neutropenia [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. 
5.6 
Severe Cutaneous Reactions 
Grade 3 and 4 cutaneous reactions occurred in 2.8% and 0.6% of 317 patients treated with ALIQOPA 
monotherapy, respectively [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Serious cutaneous reaction events were reported in 
0.9%. The reported events included dermatitis exfoliative, exfoliative rash, pruritus, and rash (including 
Reference ID: 4152629
 7 
 
maculo-papular rash). Withhold, reduce dose, or discontinue ALIQOPA depending on the severity and 
persistence of severe cutaneous reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. 
5.7  Embryo-Fetal Toxicity 
Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action, ALIQOPA can cause fetal harm when 
administered to a pregnant woman. In animal reproduction studies, administration of copanlisib to pregnant 
rats during organogenesis caused embryo-fetal death and fetal abnormalities in rats at maternal doses as low 
as 0.75 mg/kg/day (4.5 mg/m2/day body surface area) corresponding to approximately 12% the 
recommended dose for patients. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of 
reproductive potential and males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective 
contraception during treatment and for at least one month after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations 
(8.1, 8.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)].

6.1  Clinical Trials Experience 
Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the 
clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not 
reflect the rates observed in the general patient population. 
The safety data reflect exposure to ALIQOPA in 168 adults with follicular lymphoma and other hematologic 
malignancies treated with ALIQOPA 60 mg or 0.8 mg/kg equivalent in clinical trials. The median duration 
of treatment was 22 weeks (range 1 to 206 weeks).  
Serious adverse reactions were reported in 44 (26%) patients. The most frequent serious adverse reactions 
that occurred were pneumonia (8%), pneumonitis (5%) and hyperglycemia (5%). The most common adverse 
reactions (≥20%) were hyperglycemia, diarrhea, decreased general strength and energy, hypertension, 
leukopenia, neutropenia, nausea, lower respiratory tract infections, and thrombocytopenia.  
Adverse reactions resulted in dose reduction in 36 (21%) and discontinuation in 27 (16%) patients. The most 
common reasons for dose reduction were hyperglycemia (7%), neutropenia (5%), and hypertension (5%). 
The most common reasons for drug discontinuation were pneumonitis (2%) and hyperglycemia (2%). 
Table 2 provides the adverse reactions occurring in at least 10% of patients receiving ALIQOPA 
monotherapy, and Table 3 provides the treatment-emergent laboratory abnormalities in ≥20% of patients and 
≥4% of Grade ≥3 treated with ALIQOPA.

DRUG INTERACTIONS  
7.1 
Effect of Other Drugs on Copanlisib  
Strong CYP3A Inducers 
Avoid concomitant use of ALIQOPA with strong CYP3A inducers. Concomitant use of ALIQOPA with 
strong CYP3A inducers may decrease copanlisib AUC and Cmax [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].  
Examplesa of strong CYP3A inducers include: carbamazepine, enzalutamide, mitotane, phenytoin, rifampin, 
St. John’s wortb. 
Strong CYP3A Inhibitors 
Concomitant use of ALIQOPA with strong CYP3A inhibitors increases the copanlisib AUC. If concomitant 
use with strong CYP3A inhibitors cannot be avoided, reduce the ALIQOPA dose to 45 mg. An increase in 
the copanlisib AUC may increase the risk of adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].  
Examplesa of strong CYP3A inhibitors include: boceprevir, clarithromycin, cobicistat, conivaptan, 
danoprevir and ritonavir, diltiazem, elvitegravir and ritonavir, grapefruit juicec, idelalisib, indinavir and 
ritonavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir and ritonavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, paritaprevir and 
ritonavir and (ombitasvir and/or dasabuvir), posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir and ritonavir, tipranavir and 
ritonavir, troleandomycin, voriconazole.    
aThese examples are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all possible drugs that may fit this category. The 
healthcare provider should consult appropriate references for comprehensive information.  
bThe induction potency of St. John’s wort may vary widely based on preparation. 
cThe effect of grapefruit juice varies widely among brands and is concentration-, dose-, and preparation-dependent. Studies have 
shown that it can be classified as a “strong CYP3A inhibitor” when a certain preparation was used (e.g., high dose, double 
strength) or as a “moderate CYP3A inhibitor” when another preparation was used (e.g., low dose, single strength).

USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 
8.1 
Pregnancy 
Risk Summary 
Based on findings from animal studies and the mechanism of action, ALIQOPA can cause fetal harm when 
administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. 
There are no available data in pregnant women to inform the drug-associated risk. In animal reproduction 
studies, administration of copanlisib to pregnant rats during organogenesis resulted in embryo-fetal death 
and fetal abnormalities at maternal doses approximately 12% of the recommended dose for patients (see 
Data). Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. 
Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. The 
background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the U.S. 
general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically 
recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. 
Data 
Animal Data 
In an embryo-fetal development study in rats, pregnant animals received intravenous doses of copanlisib of 
0, 0.75, or 3 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. Administration of copanlisib at the dose of 3 
mg/kg/day resulted in maternal toxicity and no live fetuses. Copanlisib administration at the dose of 0.75 
mg/kg/day was maternally toxic and resulted in embryo-fetal death (increased resorptions, increased post-
implantation loss, and decreased numbers of fetuses/dam). The dose of 0.75 mg/kg/day also resulted in 
increased incidence of fetal gross external (domed head, malformed eyeballs or eyeholes), soft tissue 
(hydrocephalus internus, ventricular septal defects, major vessel malformations), and skeletal (dysplastic 
forelimb bones, malformed ribs and vertebrae, and pelvis shift) abnormalities. The dose of 0.75 mg/kg/day 
(4.5 mg/m2 body surface area) in rats is approximately 12% of the recommended dose for patients. 
Following administration of radiolabeled copanlisib to pregnant rats approximately 1.5% of the radioactivity 
(copanlisib and metabolites) reached the fetal compartment.  
8.2 
Lactation 
Risk Summary 
There are no data on the presence of copanlisib and/or metabolites in human milk, the effects on the 
breastfed child, or on milk production. Following administration of radiolabeled copanlisib to lactating rats, 
approximately 2% of the radioactivity was secreted into milk; the milk to plasma ratio of radioactivity was 
25-fold. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from copanlisib, advise a 
lactating woman not to breastfeed during treatment with ALIQOPA and for at least 1 month after the last 
dose. 
8.3 
Females and Males of Reproductive Potential 
Pregnancy Testing 
ALIQOPA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations 
(8.1)]. Conduct pregnancy testing prior to initiation of ALIQOPA treatment.  
Contraception 
Females  
Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception (contraception with a 
failure rate <1% per year) during treatment with ALIQOPA and for at least one month after the last dose.  
Males  
Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use highly effective contraception 
during treatment with ALIQOPA and for at least one month after the last dose. 
Reference ID: 4152629

Infertility  
There are no data on the effect of ALIQOPA on human fertility. Due to the mechanism of action of 
copanlisib, and findings in animal studies, adverse effects on reproduction, including fertility, are expected 
[see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].  
8.4 
Pediatric Use 
Safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients. 
8.5 
Geriatric Use 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients ≥65 years of age. Of 168 patients with follicular lymphoma and 
other hematologic malignancies treated with ALIQOPA, 48% were age 65 or older while 16% were age 75 
or older. No clinically relevant differences in efficacy were observed between elderly and younger patients. 
In patients ≥65 years of age, 30% experienced serious adverse reactions and 21% experienced adverse 
reactions leading to discontinuation. In the patients <65 years of age, 23% experienced serious adverse 
reactions and 11% experienced adverse reactions leading to discontinuation.

DESCRIPTION 
ALIQOPA (copanlisib) is a kinase inhibitor for intravenous infusion. The active pharmaceutical ingredient 
is copanlisib dihydrochloride which exists as a non-stoichiometric hydrate and has the molecular formula of 
C23H28N8O4 2HCl and a molecular weight of 553.45 g/mol. The molecular formula and molecular weight 
are based on the anhydrous form. The chemical name is 2-amino-N-{7-methoxy-8-[3-(morpholin-4-
yl)propoxy]-2,3-dihydroimidazo[1,2-c]quinazolin-5-yl}pyrimidine-5-carboxamide dihydrochloride. 
Copanlisib dihydrochloride has the following structural formula: 
 
 
 
 
ALIQOPA is supplied in single-dose vials as a sterile lyophilized solid for reconstitution and further dilution 
for intravenous infusion. The product is white to slightly yellowish. After reconstitution, the solution is 
colorless to slightly yellowish. Each vial contains 60 mg copanlisib free base (equivalent to 69.1 mg 
copanlisib dihydrochloride). After reconstitution, each mL contains 15 mg copanlisib free base (equivalent 
to 17.3 mg copanlisib dihydrochloride). 
Inactive ingredients: Citric acid anhydrous, mannitol, sodium hydroxide. 
12 
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY  
12.1 Mechanism of Action 
Copanlisib is an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) with inhibitory activity predominantly 
against PI3K-α and PI3K-δ isoforms expressed in malignant B cells. Copanlisib has been shown to induce 
tumor cell death by apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation of primary malignant B cell lines. Copanlisib 
inhibits several key cell-signaling pathways, including B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, CXCR12 mediated 
chemotaxis of malignant B cells, and NFκB signaling in lymphoma cell lines. 
12.2 Pharmacodynamics 
At 60 mg (or 0.8 mg/kg) of ALIQOPA dose, the elevation of plasma glucose was associated with higher 
copanlisib exposure.  
Reference ID: 4152629
 12 
 
12.3 Pharmacokinetics 
The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of 
ALIQOPA increase dose-proportionally over 5 to 93 mg (0.08 to 1.55 times the approved recommended 
dose) absolute dose range and exhibit linear pharmacokinetics. There is no time-dependency and no 
accumulation in the pharmacokinetics of copanlisib.  
The geometric mean (range) steady state copanlisib exposure at 0.8 mg/kg (approximately the approved 
recommended dose of 60 mg) are 463 (range: 105 to 1670; SD: 584) ng/mL for Cmax and 1570 (range: 536 to 
3410; SD: 338) nghr/mL for AUC0-25h.  
Distribution 
The in vitro human plasma protein binding of copanlisib is 84.2%. Albumin is the main binding protein. The 
in vitro mean blood-to-plasma ratio is 1.7 (range: 1.5 to 2.1). The geometric mean volume of distribution is 
871 (range: 423 to 2150; SD: 479) L.  
Elimination 
The geometric mean terminal elimination half-life of copanlisib is 39.1 (range: 14.6 to 82.4; SD: 15.0) hours. 
The geometric mean clearance is 17.9 (range: 7.3 to 51.4; SD: 8.5) L/hr.  
Metabolism 
Approximately >90% of copanlisib metabolism is mediated by CYP3A and <10% by CYP1A1. The M-1 
metabolite accounts for 5% of total radioactivity AUC and its pharmacological activity is comparable to the 
parent compound copanlisib for the tested kinases PI3KandPI3K. 
Excretion 
Copanlisib is excreted approximately 50% as unchanged compound and 50% as metabolites in humans. 
Following a single intravenous dose of 12 mg (0.2 times the recommended approved dose) radiolabeled 
copanlisib, approximately 64% of the administered dose was recovered in feces and 22% in urine within 20 
to 34 days. Unchanged copanlisib represented approximately 30% of the administered dose in feces and 15% 
in urine. Metabolites resulting from CYP450-mediated oxidation metabolism accounted for 41% of the 
administered dose. 
Specific Populations 
Copanlisib pharmacokinetic differences in the subpopulations listed below are assessed using population 
pharmacokinetic analyses. 
Age (20 to 90 years), gender, race (White, Asian, Hispanic, and Black), smoking status, body weight (41 to 
130 kg), mild hepatic impairment [total bilirubin (TB) ≤ upper limit of normal (ULN) and aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) > ULN, or TB < 1-1.5 x ULN and any AST], and mild to moderate renal 
impairment [CLcr ≥ 30 mL/min as estimated by Cockcroft-Gault (C-G) equation] had no clinically 
significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of copanlisib. The pharmacokinetics of copanlisib in patients with 
moderate to severe hepatic impairment (TB ≥ 1.5 x ULN, any AST), severe renal impairment (CLcr = 15-29 
mL/min by C-G equation), or end stage renal disease (CLcr < 15 mL/min by C-G equation) with or without 
dialysis is unknown. 
Drug Interaction Studies 
Clinical Studies 
Effect of CYP3A and P-gp Inducers on Copanlisib 
Rifampin, a strong CYP3A and a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter inducer, administered at a dose of 600 
mg once daily for 12 days with a single intravenous dose of 60 mg ALIQOPA in patients with cancer 
resulted in a 63% decrease in the mean AUC and a 15% decrease in Cmax of copanlisib [see Drug 
Interactions (7.1)]. 
Reference ID: 4152629
 13 
 
Effect of CYP3A, P-gp and BCRP Inhibitors on Copanlisib 
Itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor and a P-gp and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) transporter 
inhibitor, administered at a dose of 200 mg once daily for 10 days increased the mean AUC of a single 
intravenous dose of 60 mg ALIQOPA by 53% (or 1.53-fold) with no effect on Cmax (1.03-fold) in patients 
with cancer [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. 
In Vitro Studies 
Effect of Transporters on Copanlisib:  
Copanlisib is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP, but not a substrate for organic cation transporter (OCT) 1, 
OCT2, and OCT3, organic anion transporter (OAT) 1 and OAT3, organic anion-transporting polypeptide 
(OATP) 1B1 and OATP1B3, multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1(MATE1) or MATE2-K. 
Effect of Copanlisib on CYP and non-CYP Enzymes           
Copanlisib is not an inhibitor of the metabolism of drugs that are substrates of the major CYP isoforms 
(CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4) or uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase 
isoforms (UGT) or dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) at therapeutic 60 mg dose plasma 
concentrations. Copanlisib is not an inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 and CYP3A.  
Effect of Copanlisib on Drug Transporter Substrates 
Copanlisib is not an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, multi-drug resistance-associated protein (MRP2), bile salt 
export pump (BSEP), OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, and MATE1 at therapeutic 60 
mg dose plasma concentrations. 
Copanlisib is an inhibitor of MATE2-K (IC50: 0.09 M). Based on the PK of copanlisib, inhibition may 
occur after copanlisib infusion at approved recommended dosage. The clinical significance of this potential 
inhibition on plasma concentrations of concomitantly administered drugs that are MATE2-K substrates is 
unknown.  
13 
NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY  
13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with copanlisib. 
Copanlisib did not cause genetic damage in in vitro or in vivo assays. 
Fertility studies with copanlisib were not conducted; however, adverse findings in male and female 
reproductive systems were observed in the repeat dose toxicity studies. Findings in the male rats and/or dogs 
included effects on the testes (germinal epithelial degeneration, decreased weight, and/or tubular atrophy), 
epididymides (spermatic debris, decreased weight, and/or oligospermia/aspermia), and prostate (reduced 
secretion and/or decreased weight). Findings in female rats included effects on ovaries (hemorrhage, 
hemorrhagic cysts, and decreased weight), uterus (atrophy, decreased weight), vagina (mononuclear 
infiltration), and a dose-related reduction in the numbers of female rats in estrus.

CLINICAL STUDIES  
14.1  Relapsed Follicular Lymphoma 
The efficacy of ALIQOPA was evaluated in a single-arm, multicenter, phase 2 clinical trial (NCT 01660451) 
CHRONOS-1 in a total of 142 subjects, which included 104 subjects with follicular B-cell non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma who had relapsed disease following at least two prior treatments. Patients must have received 
rituximab and an alkylating agent. Baseline patient characteristics are summarized in Table 4. The most 
common prior systemic therapies were chemotherapy in combination with anti-CD20 immunotherapy (89%), 
chemotherapy alone (41%), and anti-CD20 immunotherapy alone (37%). In CHRONOS-1, 34% of patients 
received two prior lines of therapy and 36% received three prior lines of therapy.
