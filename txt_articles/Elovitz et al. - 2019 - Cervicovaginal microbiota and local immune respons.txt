Failure to predict and understand the causes of preterm birth, the leading cause of neonatal
morbidity and mortality, have limited effective interventions and therapeutics. From a cohort
of 2000 pregnant women, we performed a nested case control study on 107 well-phenotyped
cases of spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) and 432 women delivering at term. Using
innovative Bayesian modeling of cervicovaginal microbiota, seven bacterial taxa were
significantly associated with increased risk of sPTB, with a stronger effect in African
American women. However, higher vaginal levels of β-defensin-2 lowered the risk of sPTB
associated with cervicovaginal microbiota in an ethnicity-dependent manner. Surprisingly,
even in Lactobacillus spp. dominated cervicovaginal microbiota, low β-defensin-2 was
associated with increased risk of sPTB. These findings hold promise for diagnostics to
accurately identify women at risk for sPTB early in pregnancy. Therapeutic strategies
could include immune modulators and microbiome-based therapeutics to reduce this
significant health burden.

 P
reterm birth (PTB) (defined as birth before 37 completed
weeks of gestation) is the leading cause of death in neonates
and children under the age of 51,2. Every year worldwide,
1.1 million babies die from consequences of prematurity. PTB
occurs in one out of every 10 pregnant women in the United
States and over 65–75% of all PTBs are spontaneous with the
idiopathic onset of cervical change, uterine contractility and/or
rupture of fetal membranes, while the remaining PTBs are
medically indicated for reasons such as preeclampsia or fetal
distress3. The economic burden of preterm birth is staggering,
with an estimated cost of $26 billion per year in the United States
alone4,5. While there is known racial disparity in spontaneous
preterm birth (sPTB) with African-American women having
significantly higher rates than non-African American women,
factors that underpin this disparity remain elusive6. While there
are medical, societal, and economic costs to the actual PTB, the
larger cost to our society stems from the need for long-term care
for these preterm infants7. Ex-preterm children are at increased
risk for a spectrum of neurobehavioral disorders—ranging from
cognitive deficits to cerebral palsy to neurobehavioral abnorm-
alities including autism8–10. A failure to understand the causes of
PTB have limited effective interventions and therapeutics.
The interaction between microbial communities and their host,
in many biological niches, has been found to be mechanistically
involved in health and disease pathogenesis11–17. To date, there
have been a few studies that have examined the relationship
between cervicovaginal microbial communities and sPTB18–22.
Definitive conclusions from these studies are difficult to establish
as phenotyping of sPTB is heterogenous, the number of sPTB
cases is significantly limited and methodology is variable.
Here, to overcome sample size limitations, misclassification of
cases and methodological differences, we conducted a study
involving a prospective cohort of 2000 women with singleton
pregnancies called Motherhood & Microbiome (M&M) and tes-
ted associations of cervicovaginal microbial communities and
local immunological features with sPTB. A nested 1:4 case control
study on 107 well-phenotyped cases of sPTB and 432 women
delivering at term as control, and frequency matched for race, was
performed after enrollment was completed and all delivery
adjudicated (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1). The population
studied was mostly African American (AA) (74.5%) with a mean
maternal age of around 28 years old. Characteristics associated
with sPTB were statistically different, including history of sPTB
or second trimester loss, cervical length, cerclage, and vaginal
bleeding in the second trimester, while no other demographic,
behaviors or clinical factors were different between the cases and
controls at baseline and at each visit (Table 1 and Supplementary
Table 1). Cervicovaginal samples and anthropometric measure-
ments were prospectively collected during three clinical visits
between 16–20 (visit 1), 20–24 (visit 2), and 24–28 (visit 3) weeks
of gestation. The cervicovaginal microbiota was characterized and
immunological profiles established.
Results
Cervicovaginal community state types sPTB. We identified six
major cervicovaginal community state types (CSTs)23, of which
four were predominated by either Lactobacillus crispatus (CST I),
Lactobacillus gasseri (CST II), Lactobacillus iners (CST III) or
Lactobacillus jensenii (CST V), and two (CST IV-A and CST IV-
B) comprised a wide array of strict and facultative bacterial
anaerobes, where CST IV-A was characterized with the higher
abundance of BVAB1. The frequency of CSTs (Supplementary
Table 2) was significantly different in AA and non-African
American (non-AA) women (Fig. 1a). At visit 1, 20% and 45% of
AA women were in CST I or CST IVA/IVB, as compared to 50%
and ~15% of non-AA women, respectively. These differences
persisted at visit 2 and visit 3 (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The fre-
quency of CST III was higher in AA women at visit 3. Conversely,
CST V was consistently lower in AA than in non-AA women
throughout the study. When considering all women in the study
at visit 1, CST IV-B was statistically significantly higher in the
sPTB group than in the term group (Fig. 1b). Interestingly, in
non-AA women a statistically significant association between
CST IV-B and sPTB was observed when all visits were considered,
at visit 1 and 2 (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1b). This asso-
ciation was absent in African American women (Fig. 1b) at all
study visits. In non-AA women, higher frequency of CST V was
associated with term pregnancy, while the opposite was shown in
AA women, however, the frequency of this CST was low in the
cohort. These findings point to different contributions of the
cervicovaginal microbiota to sPTB in AA and non-AA pregnant
women, a hypothesis we thus addressed and considered in all
analyses.
Bacterial taxa associated with sPTB. Because within a CST the
specific relative abundance or presence of certain bacterial taxa
can vary, we explored the dependence of the risk of sPTB on the
relative abundance of specific bacterial taxa (Supplementary
Data 1 and 2) using a Bayesian logistic regression nonparametric
adaptive spline model while accounting for measurement errors
obtained when sampling low relative abundance taxa, and

 modeled using a dataset generated from 14 sequencing positive
control samples (Supplementary Data 3). When considering all
subjects and all visits, we identified seven bacterial taxa statisti-
cally significantly associated with increased risk of sPTB (Fig. 1c).
The strongest association was observed with Mobiluncus curtsii/
mulieris and Sneathia sanguinegens, with M. curtsii/mulieris, g
Atopobium, and g Megasphaera exerting the most profound effect
on the risk of sPTB, with effect sizes of 0.33 for g Atopobium, 0.40
for g Megasphaera, and 0.46 for M. curtsii/mulieris (q-value <
0.0001) (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 2a and Supplementary
Table 3). We established for each taxon a relative abundance
threshold above which the risk of sPTB is significantly different
from baseline (Fig. 1c). When all subjects and samples collected at
visit 1 were considered, M. curtsii/mulieris was the only bacterial
taxa associated with increased risk of sPTB (Supplementary
Fig. 2c). In AA women, the increased relative abundances of five
of these bacterial taxa remained significantly associated with
increased risk of sPTB (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 2b). M.
curtsii/mulieris and Mageebacillus indolicus had the strongest
association (q-value < 0.0001) and the largest effect sizes (0.53 and
0.36, respectively), with a rate of sPTB over 60 and 55% at the
highest relative abundance of these two bacterial taxa (Fig. 1b and
Supplementary Fig. 2b). The association with M. curtsii/mulieris
remained when only samples collected at visit 1 were considered,
but with a lower effect size of 0.27 (q-value = 2.03e−0.5) (Sup-
plementary Fig. 2d and Supplementary Table 3). In non-AA
women, L. iners and Atopobium vaginae were significantly asso-
ciated with increased rates of sPTB, but with modest effect sizes of
0.15 and 0.11, respectively (Supplementary Table 3). When
comparing nulliparous and multiparous women, g Megasphaera,
g Atopobium, and S. sanguinegens were strongly associated with
sPTB in nulliparity (effect sizes above 0.24) but not in multiparity
where M. curtsii/mulieris alone showed significance with an effect
size of 0.44. The identification of different features of the cervi-
covaginal microbiota and their contribution to the risk of sPTB in
AA and non-AA, CST types, or parity will afford a stratification
scheme of risk and improved clinical managements.
Survival analysis. A survival analysis for term delivery as a
function of gestational age in all pregnant women with these
seven bacterial taxa at relative abundances above or below their
significant risk of sPTB threshold values (Fig. 1c and Supple-
mentary Table 3) identified M. curtsii/mulieris, M. indolicus, and
S. sanguinegens as significantly increasing the risk of sPTB with
hazard ratios (HR) ranging from 1.38 to 1.96 (estimated using
Cox proportional hazard regression models) (Fig. 1e). These
analyses demonstrate strong associations between the relative
abundance of these taxa and sPTB but notably with early sPTB
occurring at <34 weeks (Fig. 1d). When limiting the analysis to
AA pregnant women, HR increases ranging from 1.44 to 3.13 for
M. curtsii/mulieris (Fig. 1c–e).
Bacterial taxa absolute abundance and sPTB. Because quanti-
tative estimates of bacterial taxa have high translational potential
to clinical settings, we explored their relationship with birth
outcomes. We showed that the total bacterial burden was sig-
nificantly lower after 24 weeks of gestation in women who went
on to deliver preterm compared to those who delivered at term in
whom bacterial burden remained high (Supplementary Fig. 3a),
while no differences in Shannon diversity was observed over
gestational age (Supplementary Fig. 4). Interestingly, higher
absolute abundance of M. curtsii/mulieris remained significantly
associated with the increased risk of sPTB when all visits were
considered in all subjects and in AA alone, as well as in women
with cervicovaginal microbiota of CST IV-B types (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table 4).
Risk of sPTB modulation by Lactobacillus spp. It is believed
that Lactobacillus spp. is generally associated with positive
reproductive and health outcomes24. We thus explored a poten-
tial modulatory role for Lactobacillus spp. of the risk for sPTB
associated with M. curtsii/mulieris. The risk associated with M.
curtsii/mulieris is unchanged and remains high when Lactoba-
cillus relative abundances are in the lowest tertile, while it is
eliminated when Lactobacillus relative abundances are in second
or third tertiles. This finding was evident in both AA women
(Fig. 2a) and in all subjects (Supplementary Fig. 5a) at visit 1. This
finding supports a beneficial role for Lactobacillus spp. even in the
presence of bacterial taxa associated with a significant increased
risk for sPTB.
Risk of sPTB and β-defensin-2. We sought to assess if local
immune
responses
would
further
modulate
this
microbe-
associated risk of sPTB and explored the interaction between
cervicovaginal levels of β-defensin-2 and pregnancy outcomes in
the M&M cohort. β-defensin-2 are host-derived anti-microbial
peptides that, in the genital track, can be constitutively expressed
or induced upon bacterial infections25. β-defensin-2 were mea-
sured at visit 1 (Supplementary Table 5). Comparison of β-
defensin-2 levels by pregnancy outcomes shows that women who
ultimately had a sPTB had lower levels of β-defensin-2 (Fig. 2b).
This association remains in AA women, but not in non-AA
women (Supplementary Fig. 6). More interestingly, non-AA
women who delivered at term had lower levels of β-defensin-2
than AA women who delivered preterm. This association appears
to be modulated by the structure of the cervicovaginal microbiota.
Lower β-defensin-2 levels were observed in AA women who had a
sPTB and harbor a cervicovaginal microbiota of CST III, CST IV-
A, and CST V (Fig. 2b), while in all subjects, lower levels of β-
defensin-2 were found in women who delivered preterm and
harbor CST I, CST II, and CST IV-A (Supplementary Fig. 5b). In
AA women, when stratifying β-defensin-2 levels in quartiles, the
risk of sPTB associated with the presence of g Atopobium, M.
curtsii/mulieris, S. sanguinegens, and M. indolicus was increased
in the first quartile and lowered in the fourth quartile (Fig. 2c),
indicating that β-defensin-2 levels modulate the risk of sPTB
associated with the presence of some of these bacterial taxa but
not all (i.e., g Megasphaera).
Interactions between risk modulators and sPTB. These results
led us to consider the possibility that a complex interaction exists
between the modulators (β-defensin-2 levels and relative abun-
dance of Lactobacillus spp.), M. curtsii/mulieris, CSTs and risk of
sPTB (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 6). We showed that in AA
women the risk of sPTB is high even in the presence of Lacto-
bacillus spp. (including L. crispatus dominated CST) when β-
defensin-2 levels are low (1st tertile) (p = 0.011), and that sPTB
rates trended lower when β-defensin-2 levels are high (3rd tertile)
and that whether the microbiota is dominated by Lactobacillus
spp. (CST I, II, III or V) (3rd tertile) or comprising of strict and
facultative anaerobes and low Lactobacillus spp. (first and second
tertile). Most women with relative abundances of M. curtsii/

 subjects in the analysis (Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary
Table 6) and when combining all samples with high β-defensin-2
(3rd tertile) and all tertiles of Lactobacillus spp. (Supplementary
Table 6). These findings start to unravel the complex interactions
that exist in the cervicovaginal environments between immune
factors, the microbiota and the risk to sPTB. While this study is
well-powered and the associations statistically significant, a larger
number of cases would afford greater statistical power to explore
additional factors that are thought to contribute to increasing or
reducing the risk of sPTB.
Discussion
The study has major implications to the clinical management of
pregnant women, as it identified specific signatures combining
both immune and microbial factors associated with sPTB. The
latter include both risk factors and risk modulators. The findings
address a long-held belief that not having Lactobacillus spp.-
dominated cervicovaginal microbiota is strongly associated with
adverse pregnancy outcomes. As shown here and in previous
studies20,22 in pregnancy and non-pregnancy, a larger proportion
of AA women compared to non-AA do not have Lactobacillus
spp. in high relative abundance in the cervicovaginal microbiota.
While the rate of sPTB is higher in AA women, the difference
cannot be explained by the lack of Lactobacillus spp. as many AA
women deliver at term despite lacking Lactobacillus spp. Con-
versely, harboring a Lactobacillus spp. does not guarantee a term
birth in both AA and non-AA women. Further, different causes
of sPTB appear to drive risk in AA and non-AA women. Here we
show that immune factors, such as β-defensin-2, can modulate
the risk associated with the lack of Lactobacillus spp., but are also
critical even when Lactobacillus spp. are in high relative abun-
dance. However, the reasons why some women have high or low
β-defensin-2 levels is unknown. Differences in local cervi-
covaginal immune profiles in pregnancy has been poorly docu-
mented, especially as it relates to sPTB, and mixed results have
been
reported
between
cervicovaginal
microbiota
and
β-defensins26,27. Genetic variants or copy number28 in β-
defensin-2 genes, or changes in response to bacterial exposures,
or a combination of both could explain such variations, including
the identified ethnic differences, but environmental exposure
factors cannot be excluded to play a role in the shaping of the
cervicovaginal environment and the risk to sPTB. Alternatively,
one can speculate that early exposure to non-Lactobacillus spp.
cervicovaginal microbiota at birth could lead to tolerance to these
predominantly anaerobic bacteria later in life resulting in specific
immune profiles. Nonetheless, the profiles identified in this study
could serve as diagnostic signatures with important clinical
relevance. However, the clinical significance of any differences or
microbial immune correlations cannot be fully interpreted until
these biomarkers are validated in another clinical trial outside of
the case-control study.
Women with a sPTB present with contractions, cervical dila-
tation and/or preterm premature rupture of membranes. As
women can present with several of these symptoms, clear phe-
notyping by preterm rupture of membranes or cervical dilation is
problematic. Therefore, for clinical studies, these various clinical
presentations are collectively characterized as sPTB. Current

 clinical approaches to identify and reduce the risk of sPTB
include screening for short cervical length in all women and
treating women with a prior sPTB with 17-alpha hydro-
xyprogesterone caproate (17OHPC). These strategies are limited.
Only 9% of all sPTB have an antecedent short cervix in mid-
pregnancy29. While vaginal progesterone has been shown to
confer some protection against sPTB in women with a short
cervix, considering the small percent of women who have a short
cervix this strategy will not significantly impact the rate of
sPTB29,30. A prior sPTB is the largest known risk factor for sPTB.
Based on a clinical trial, 17OHPC is recommended for all women
with a prior sPTB31,32. However, only a small percent of the
total number of women having a sPTB had a prior sPTB, and
the therapy is effective in only 1/3 of those who receive it31.
Consequently, the current standards of care to screen for a short
cervix or/and or targeting women with a prior sPTB will not
significantly decrease the public health burden from sPTB33.
Studies such as this one will lead to novel sPTB prevention
strategies based on appropriate risk stratification of pregnant
women and informed personal counseling. Most importantly, this
work will lead to innovative therapeutic opportunities to prevent
sPTB including combination of microbiome-based therapeutics
and immune modulators earlier in pregnancy.
Methods
Study design and sample collection. A prospective cohort study of 2000 women
with singleton pregnancies was utilized M&M, of which biospecimens were
obtained for 1943 participants and delivery information was available for 1920
from whom the case/controls were derived. All participants provided written
informed consent and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at
the University of Pennsylvania (IRB #818914) and the University of Maryland
School of Medicine (HP-00045398). Women were enrolled between December
2013 and February 2017. Enrollment had to occur prior to 20 weeks of pregnancy.
Cervicovaginal specimens were self-collected by the participant or collected by a
research coordinator if a clinical exam was indicated at three different prenatal
visits: 16–20 weeks (visit 1), 20–24 weeks (visit 2), and 24–28 weeks (visit 3). Prior
to each visit, subjects were asked regarding antibiotic use, sexual activity, and
tobacco use in the 4 weeks prior to the visit. At each visit, a set of cervicovaginal
swabs was obtained. These included an ESwabs (COPAN) stored in 1 ml of Amies
Transport Medium and a Dacron swab stored without buffer. All samples were
immediately frozen at −80 °C until processing. Subjects were followed to delivery.
All delivery outcomes were recorded. Cases of PTB were adjudicated by the PI to
determine if the cases were medically indicated PTBs or spontaneous. PTB was
considered spontaneous when a woman presented with either cervical dilation and/
or premature rupture of membranes and delivered prior to 37 weeks. Women
delivered for maternal indications (e.g., preeclampsia) or fetal indication (e.g., fetal
growth restriction) were not considered sPTB. Women were eligible for the study
if they had a singleton pregnancy and presented prior to 20 weeks of gestation.
Women were excluded if they met any of the following criteria: (1) major fetal
anomaly, (2) HIV positive status, (3) history of organ transplant, and (4) chronic
steroid use (>20 mg per day for more than 30 days at the time of first study visit).
To assess the cervicovaginal microbial communities, a nested case-control selection
of subjects was performed. Among the 1943 women who completed the study,
all women who had a sPTB were selected. Controls were frequency matched by
self-reported race to the cases.
Cervicovaginal 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing. Cervicovaginal
ESwabs were thawed on ice, and 300 µl of Amies transport medium containing
vaginal secretion were processed using the MoBio PowerMag Microbiome DNA/
RNA kit (now MagAttract PowerMicrobiome DNA/RNA kit, Qiagen) automated
on a Hamilton Microlab STAR robotic platform after a bead-beating step on a
Qiagen TissueLyser II (20 Hz for 20 min) in 96 deep well plate. Amplification of the
V3–V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene was performed using a two step-PCR in
which the sample specific barcode is added during the second PCR. The first PCR
used the short 16S rRNA gene specific primers 319F (ACACTGACGACATGGT
TCTACA[0–7]ACTCCTRCGGGAGGCAGCAG) and 806R (TACGGTAGCAG
AGACTTGGTCT[0–7]GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT) where the underlined
sequence is the Illumina sequencing primer sequence and [0–7] indicate the pre-
sence of an heterogeneous pad sequence to improve sequencing quality34, for a
total of 20 cycles. This first step was followed by 10 cycles with primers H1
(AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACNNNNNNNNACACTGACGAC
ATGGTTCTACA) and H2 (CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATNNNNNNN
NTACGGTAGCAGAGACTTGGTCT) where NNNNNN indicates a sample spe-
cific barcode sequence and the underlined sequence corresponds to the Illumina
sequencing primer for priming to the first step amplicon. This second step extends
the amplicon with the Illumina required adaptor sequences and the sample specific
dual barcode system34. Amplicons were visualized on a 2% agarose gel, quantified,
pooled in equimolar concentration, and purified prior to loading on an Illumina
HiSeq 2500 (San Diego, CA, USA) modified to generate 300 bp paired-end reads35.
Extraction and PCR negative controls were processed in parallel. Additionally, a
positive control composed of a mixture of 20 vaginal biological specimens of
known composition combined into one tube was processed and sequenced in
parallel on each of 14 pools of study samples as per the laboratory standard
protocol (Supplementary Data 3).
Total 16S rRNA gene copy number measurement. The total number of 16S
rRNA gene copy in each DNA sample was measured using the TaqMan® Bact-
Quant assay targeting the V3–V4 regions of the gene36. Amplification primers were
FOR (CCTACGGGDGGCWGCA) and REV (GGACTACHVGGGTMTCT
AATC), and TaqMan® probe was 6FAM (fluorescin)-CAGCAGCCGCGGTA-M
GBNFQ (minor groove binder non-fluorescent quencher). The total number of
16S rRNA gene copies was expressed as copy per swab and is used as an estimate
of bacterial load (total count of bacterial cells present in a sample). An estimate of
absolute abundance of each taxon was calculated for each sample by multiplying
the total 16S rRNA gene copies obtained by qPCR and the relative abundance
of that taxa obtained by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
Bioinformatics methods for microbiota analysis. The sequences were de-
multiplexed using the dual-barcode strategy, a mapping file linking barcode to
samples and split_libraries.py, a QIIME-dependent script37. The resulting forward
and reverse fastq files were split by sample using the QIIME-dependent script
split_sequence_file_on_sample_ids.py, and primer sequences were removed using
TagCleaner (version 0.16)38. Further processing followed the DADA2 Workflow
for Big Data and dada2 (v. 1.5.2) (https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/bigdata.
html,39). Forward and reverse reads were each trimmed using lengths of 255 and
225 bp, respectively, and filtered to contain no ambiguous bases, minimum quality
score of 2, and required to contain less than two expected errors based on their
quality score. The relationship between quality scores and error rates were esti-
mated for both sequencing runs to reduce batch effects arising from run-to-run
variability. Reads were assembled and chimeras for the combined runs removed
as per dada2 protocol.

 Taxonomy was assigned to each amplicon sequence variant (ASV) generated by
dada2 using the PECAN (version 1.0), a rapid per sequence classifier (http://ravel-
lab.org/pecan). Read counts for ASVs assigned to the same taxonomy were
summed for each sample. Phylotypes previously identified as potential reagent
contaminants40, that included Pseudomonas veroni, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, g
Halomonas, g Micrococcus, g Heliorestis, and Arthrobacter cumminsii were
excluded from the dataset as they could be observed in some negative control
samples. Community state types (CST) were assigned to each sample using
hierarchical clustering with Jensen-Shannon divergence and Ward linkage41,42.
CST I is predominated with L. crispatus, CST II with L. gasseri, CST III with
L. iners, CST IV was defined as lacking Lactobacillus spp. and comprising a diverse
set of strict and facultative anaerobes, and further split into CST IV-A and CST IV-
B, while CST V is predominated with L. jensenii.
Tables including total sequence counts for or relative abundances of all taxa and
for each sample with more than 1000 sequences were generated and used for
statistical analyses (Supplementary Data 1 and 2). A total of 60,599,360 sequences
were generated from 1505 samples (540 subjects) for a mean of 40,238 sequences
per sample (range 1313–98,688). There were 242 samples from 107 subjects that
had a spontaneous premature delivery (22, 35 and 50 subjects with 1, 2, and
3 samples, respectively) and 1263 samples from 432 subjects that delivered at term
(0, 33 and 399 subjects with 1, 2, and 3 samples, respectively).
β-defensin-2 measurements. Dacron swabs (Starplex, ThermoFisher) were used
to collect cervical vaginal fluid at each gestational time point. Materials on the
swabs were eluted in sterile PBS with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete Mini)
for 5 min to release the soluble proteins. The eluate solutions were then analyzed
for the presence of human β-defensin-2 (BD-2) (Phoenix Pharmaceutical); mini-
mum detectable concentration = 15.6 pg/ml; inter-assay variation <15%; intra-
assay variation <10%) via ELISA according to manufacturer’s instructions. Indi-
vidual samples were diluted to meet the range of measurement on the assay’s
standard curve. Dilution factors were then applied to calculate precise β-defensin-2
levels.
Statistical analyses. Taxa were filtered before analysis if observed at frequencies
of 10−5 study-wide. All scripts used in statistical analyses are available in Github at
https://github.com/ravel-lab/M_and_M. Mixed effects Poisson regression models
were used to assess difference in the frequency of CSTs in women who delivered
at term and those who delivered preterm, stratified by race or birth outcome
(term vs sPTB). Ordinary logistic regression models were used for assessing
differences in CST frequencies at single visits stratifying by race and birth outcome
(term vs sPTB).
To evaluate the dependence of community diversity or bacterial absolute
abundance (log10 16S rRNA gene copy number) on gestational age, we applied
ordinary least squares model, in which samples were assumed to be independent,
with thin plate splines as implemented in the rms R package (https://cran.r-project.
org/web/packages/rms/rms.pdf). Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was used to
select the number of knots in the splines. In both cases splines with three knots had
the smallest AIC value and were selected as the best fit models.
Due to the 1:4 case-control design, the evaluation of the dependence of the risk
of spontaneous preterm delivery on bacterial taxa relative abundance was
performed on phylotypes that were present in more than 25% of samples study-
wide. In order to overcome challenges associated with the bimodal distributions of
taxa log10 relative abundances, we evaluated how the risk of sPTB depended on the
log10 relative abundances of taxa that were present in at least 25% of all samples.
In this analysis, we only included samples in which a given bacterial taxon was
detected, as no significant difference in the proportions of samples from the sPTB
or term groups were found when only considering samples in which a given
bacterial taxa was not detected. Because this dependence a priori can have a
complicated shape, a Bayesian logistic regression nonparametric adaptive spline
model was used (adapted from the spmrf R package43) as the adaptive splines
implemented in the spmrf package have superior behavior at the extremities of
the independent variable value. In this model, all samples were assumed to be
independent. Further, microbiota analyses suffer from low reproducibility when
taxa are present at low relative abundance in a sample. In order to account for these
measurement errors, we leveraged the sequence data of a sample comprising of
several vaginal swabs that were mixed and sequenced on most plates of 96 samples
processed for this study (Supplementary Data 3). Bayesian logistic regression
nonparametric adaptive spline models were run multiple times (n = 5). Specifically,
for a given taxa log10 relative abundance, a new log10 relative abundance for that
taxon is drawn from the known normal distribution of log10 relative abundance
values generated from the positive controls dataset for that log10 relative
abundance. The final spline dependence of the risk of sPTB on each taxa log10
relative abundance was estimated as the average of those five random sample
models. Because the variance around a given log10 relative abundance in the
positive controls dataset is larger for low relative abundance taxa, the confidence of
detected an effect on the risk of sPTB for a taxon at low abundance is lower, thus
the spline trends toward baseline risk of sPTB, which is the proportion of sPTB
cases in the samples harboring that taxa.
The spmrf spline models accounting for measurement errors were fitted to the
entire dataset, and on subsets that included all samples stratified by race (African
American or non-African American), by race and visit (African American or non-
African American women at visit 1), as well as by nulliparity status, and nulliparity
status limited to visit 1. The significant risk of sPTB threshold values (taxa log10
relative abundance above which the risk is significant different from baseline) were
estimated as the intersection of the risk of sPTB spline estimate, f, and horizontal
line y = min(f) + 0.1*gEff, where gEff is the effect size defined as the difference
between the maximal and minimal risk of sPTB when risk of sPTB was positively
associated with relative abundances, or negative of the difference when an inverse
association was observed. Bacterial species with effect size of <10% were excluded.
Statistical significance was set a priori at the 0.05 level after adjusting for multiple
comparisons using FDR.
The analysis of the dependence of the risk of sPTB on taxa log10 absolute
abundances was performed using the same approach as described for relative
abundance using Bayesian logistic regression nonparametric adaptive spline
models with the exception that the independent variable was log10 absolute
abundance instead of log10 relative abundance.
Comparisons of the mean log10 β-defensin-2 abundances between cases and
controls in all samples as well as between cases and controls in different CSTs
in AA women at visit 1, were performed using the t-test as log β-defensin-2
abundances within these groups follow normal distribution.
To evaluate the modulation of the risk for sPTB associated with bacterial taxa
by β-defensin-2, comparisons of sPTB proportions within different quartiles of
β-defensin-2 over samples where selected phylotypes were detected was performed
using a Bayesian 2-proportions binomial model with uniform prior implemented
in rstan R package.
Time to delivery in the presence of specific bacterial taxa was visualized with
Kaplan–Meier curves generated using the survfit() routine from the survival R
package and hazard ratios with the corresponding p-values estimated using Cox
proportional hazard regression models using coxph() routine of the survival R
package. In these models, bacterial taxa were included as time varying covariates.
We evaluated the interaction between β-defensin-2 tertiles, Lactobacillus spp.
tertiles, CSTs, M. curtsii/mulieris and sPTB. The proportion of sPTB in each cell of
the 3 × 3 table shown in Fig. 3 was compared to the proportion of sPTB (19.58%)
at visit 1 defined by the study design, and for which β-defensin-2 measurements
are available: 102 women who went on to deliver prematurely and 521 women total
for which we have β-defensin-2 measurements at visit 1. The p-value for the
null hypothesis that the proportion of sPTB in a cell is the same as the baseline
proportion of sPTB was estimated using Bayesian binomial models using uniform
prior for two proportions implemented in rstan R package. Similar approach was
used to compared proportion sPTB in combined cells to the baseline rate baseline
19.58%.
Note: In the above analyses, when samples from all three visits are included,
given the number of samples are decreasing at each visit due to preterm delivery
events, we faced the issue of missing data. The models do not account for the
non-randomness of the missing data.
