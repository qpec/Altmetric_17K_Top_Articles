In Brief
Lu et al. show that ablation of dividing
Olig2-expressing cells in a glioma model
reduces tumor initiation and growth.
Olig2 deletion in glioma also delays
growth, changes the gene expression
profile from proneural to astrocyte-
associated classical phenotype, and
leads to increased EGFR expression and
sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors.

SUMMARY
Malignant gliomas exhibit extensive heterogeneity and poor prognosis. Here we identify mitotic Olig2-
expressing cells as tumor-propagating cells in proneural gliomas, elimination of which blocks tumor initiation
and progression. Intriguingly, deletion of Olig2 resulted in tumors that grow, albeit at a decelerated rate.
Genome occupancy and expression profiling analyses reveal that Olig2 directly activates cell-proliferation
machinery to promote tumorigenesis. Olig2 deletion causes a tumor phenotypic shift from an oligodendro-
cyte precursor-correlated proneural toward an astroglia-associated gene expression pattern, manifest in
downregulation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-a and reciprocal upregulation of epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR). Olig2 deletion further sensitizes glioma cells to EGFR inhibitors and extends the life-
span of animals. Thus, Olig2-orchestrated receptor signaling drives mitotic growth and regulates glioma
phenotypic plasticity. Targeting Olig2 may circumvent resistance to EGFR-targeted drugs.
INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant brain tu-
mor in adults, exhibiting distinct molecular characteristics, and
patients have very poor prognosis with a median survival of
less than 1 year despite aggressive treatments (Jansen et al.,
2010). Tumors are resistant to conventional radiotherapy and
chemotherapies, and the efficacy of current treatments is limited
Significance
Distinct molecular characteristics in gliomas represent a significant hurdle for effective therapy. Here we uncover that a
population of mitotic Olig2+ cells is critical for initiation and progression of mouse primary gliomas. Intriguingly, deletion
of Olig2 results in tumors that exhibit persistent but decelerated growth. We find that Olig2 directly activates the transcrip-
tional program for oncogenic growth. Olig2 deletion engenders a tumor phenotype shift from a proneural to an astrocytic
gene expression pattern, with PDGF receptor-a downregulation and reciprocal EGFR signaling upregulation. Downregula-
tion of Olig2 sensitizes glioma cells to EGFR inhibition. Our observations reveal that Olig2 is a molecular arbiter of tumor
phenotype plasticity that may underlie drug resistance, suggesting new strategies for enhancing EGFR drug sensitivity in
glioma treatment.

 (Ohgaki and Kleihues, 2005; Schonberg et al., 2014). Based on
gene expression profiles, GBMs have been classified into four
distinct molecular subtypes, namely proneural, classical, neural,
and mesenchymal with distinct gene expression signatures
(Verhaak et al., 2010). The proneural subtype is highly enriched
with the signature associated with oligodendrocyte lineage cells,
whereas the classical subgroup is strongly associated with the
astrocytic signature, and the mesenchymal subgroup is enriched
with a gene signature associated with cultured/reactive astro-
cytes and microglia (Lei et al., 2011; Verhaak et al., 2010).
Much of the heterogeneity of GBMs can be attributable to their
distinct genetic alterations (Brennan et al., 2013; Carro et al.,
2010). The proneural subtype displays characteristic genetic al-
terations including PDGFRA amplification and TP53 mutations,
as well as IDH1 or IDH2 mutations (Brennan et al., 2013; Verhaak
et al., 2010), while the classical subtype is characterized by
mutational activation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
or by extra copies of EGFR (Hayden, 2010). Although distinct
events occurring in different target cells likely contribute to the
variety of GBM phenotypes, the molecular determinants that
regulate the tumor phenotype are not fully understood.
Depending on genetic alterations, glioma cells may transition
between different states by utilizing alternative pathways that
incite tumor growth and progression (Johnson et al., 2014;
Meacham and Morrison, 2013). Since either activation of tumor
necrosis factor a (TNF-a)/nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) or loss of
NF1 converts proneural GBM to the mesenchymal subtype
(Bhat et al., 2013; Ozawa et al., 2014), GBM tumor cells therefore
manifest phenotypic plasticity. This plasticity may render tumor
cells more invasive or resistant to current therapies at different
stages in their development (Friedmann-Morvinski et al., 2012;
Persson et al., 2010). At present, the underlying genetic alter-
ations and the signaling mechanisms that result in transitions be-
tween different tumor cell states remain elusive. Identification of
the molecular control of tumorigenic cell properties and cellular
hierarchies within GBM are essential for understanding patho-
genic processes and may lead to potential avenues for targeted
GBM treatment, especially with regard to confronting resistance.
Recent studies indicate that a population of stem-like tumor-
propagating cells appears to drive tumor growth and progres-
sion in GBM (Chen et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2011; Schonberg
et al., 2014). OLIG2, an early marker for oligodendroglial lineage
progenitors (Lu et al., 2002), is expressed in all grades of diffuse
gliomas (Ligon et al., 2004). Remarkably, the proneural tumor
subtype possesses a gene expression profile that resembles
that of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) (Lei et al., 2011;
Liu et al., 2011; Verhaak et al., 2010), a presumptive cell type
of origin for this type of GBM. Moreover, OLIG2 has been identi-
fied as one of the core transcription factors that reprogram differ-
entiated GBM cells into stem-like propagating cells (Suva et al.,
2014). Previous studies indicate that neural progenitors iso-
lated from Olig1/2�/�;Cdkn2a�/� embryos cannot be induced
by oncogenic EGFRvIII to form glioma in murine allografts (Ligon
et al., 2007). In addition, Olig2 appears to directly oppose p53 re-
sponses to genotoxic damage to regulate glioma growth (Mehta
et al., 2011). Currently, it is not clear whether Olig2 is required for
endogenous glioma formation, particularly on a Trp53-mutant
background, since p53 is one of the most frequently inactivated
proteins in the development of malignant glioma or GBM in
humans (Verhaak et al., 2010). The molecular mechanisms
whereby Olig2 regulates glioma tumorigenesis are not fully
understood. Furthermore, because Olig2+ cells are present
in most diffuse gliomas, whether Olig2+ propagating cells are
critical for directing tumor cell growth and progression in GBM
remains unknown.
RESULTS
Intense Olig2 Expression Characterizes Mitotic
Progenitors in Human and Mouse Gliomas
To characterize OLIG2 expression in mitotic progenitors in
human proneural-like GBM with PDGFRA amplification, we per-
formed immunostaining for OLIG2 and a proliferative marker,
Ki67. We detected extensive OLIG2 expression in tumor lesions
(Figure 1A). Approximately 35% ± 5% of OLIG2+ cells expressed
Ki67 among the GBMs examined (Figures 1B and 1C), and sub-
stantial populations of OLIG2+ cells were co-labeled with SOX2,
POU3F2, or CD133 (Figures 1B and 1C), the markers for tumor
initiating/propagating cells (Schonberg et al., 2014). These tumor
propagation-associated markers were enriched on OLIG2+ cell
populations in GBM lesions (Figures S1A and S1B). Similarly, a
large population of Ki67+ cells expressed OLIG2 in proneural
GBM (Figure S1C), which is consistent with previous findings
(Ligon et al., 2007). These observations suggest that OLIG2+
cells are highly proliferative with tumor progenitor properties in
proneural-like GBM lesions.
To investigate the role of Olig2+ cells in glioma formation, we
induced malignant gliomas in adult mice by deleting both floxed
alleles of Pten and Trp53 with a Cre-expressing retrovirus car-
rying platelet-derived growth factor subunit B (PDGFB) through
stereotaxic microinjection into the cerebral white matter (Fig-
ure 1D) (Lei et al., 2011). This murine model of malignant glioma
closely resembles the human proneural GBM (Lei et al., 2011).
These tumors carry well-defined genetic alterations with PDGF
pathway activation accompanied by Trp53 and Pten losses,
exhibiting pathological and morphological characteristics of
human GBM (Figure S1D) (Lei et al., 2011; Sonabend et al.,
2014). These mouse gliomas consisted of a large population of
Olig2-expressing cells (Figure 1E), which were highly prolifera-
tive as indicated by Ki67 expression in approximately 46% ±
6% of Olig2+ cells (Figures 1F and 1I). The proportion of Ki67+
proliferative cells among Olig2+ cells was higher than that in
Olig2� cells (Figures 1I and S1E). Similar to human proneural
GBM, a substantial population of Olig2+ cells expressed Sox2
and Pou3f2 (Figures 1G–1I and S1E). In addition, a large majority
of Ki67+ cells were Olig2 positive (Figure S1F), suggesting that
Olig2+ mitotic cells are a major component of the proliferating
cell mass in this mouse glioma model.
Ablation of Mitotic Olig2+ Cells Inhibits Glioma
Formation and Progression
To test whether Olig2+ proliferative cells are the critical source
of glioma growth, we utilized an in vivo cell suicide approach
to deplete mitotic Olig2+ progenitors by generating Olig2-TK
(thymidine kinase) mice with the ganciclovir (GCV)-inducible sui-
cide gene HSV-TK knocked in at the Olig2 locus (Figures 2A and
2B). TK expression in Olig2-TK knockin mice mirrored Olig2
expression patterns (Figure 2C). HSV-TK kinase activity converts

 GCV into toxic triphosphates that inhibit DNA polymerase
and eliminate actively dividing tumor cells, while sparing normal
post-mitotic Olig2+ cells like mature oligodendrocytes (Figures
2D, S2A, and S2B). When GCV was administered to the gli-
oma-forming mice carrying Olig2-TK at day 5 post PDGFB-Cre
virus injection (dpi 5), tumor growth was markedly inhibited
compared with control tumor-forming animals (Ptenfl/fl;Trp53fl/fl:
PDGFB-Cre; designated as Ctrl-T) (Figures 2E and 2F). GCV-
treated Olig2-TK mice had a significantly extended survival
curve relative to that of control tumor mice (Figure 2E). Histologic
analysis revealed that the majority of the Olig2-TK mice had no
detectable tumor mass and exhibited few Ki67+ proliferative
cells in the brain compared with Ctrl-T mice (Figures 2F and
2G), suggesting that Olig2+ mitotic cells represent a population
of tumor cells that are necessary for tumor propagation in this
animal model.
Even when GCV treatment was performed at dpi 20, a late
phase of tumorigenesis, the glioma-forming Olig2-TK mice sur-
vived longer compared with control groups (Figure 2H). How-
ever, the survival rate was much reduced in the animal group
administered GCV at dpi 20 compared with those treated earlier
in tumorigenesis at dpi 5 (Figures 2E and 2H). We observed
that the proportion of proliferative Olig2+ cells decreased while
the percentage of Olig2� cells among Ki67+ cells increased in
Ctrl-T tumors at dpi 23 compared with dpi 5 (Figures 2I and
2J). The increase in Olig2� proliferative cells suggests that
both Olig2+ and Olig2� mitotic cells are responsible for the tumor
growth during the late stage of tumor progression.
Olig2 Deletion Delays the Growth and Progression of
Glioma
To determine the function of Olig2 in glioma formation, we bred
floxed Pten and Trp53 mice with mice carrying an Olig2 floxed
allele (Yue et al., 2006). Cre virus transduction will ablate the
Olig2fl/fl allele together with Pten and Trp53 floxed alleles in the
same cells. The resulting animals with Olig2 deletion (Ptenfl/fl;
Trp53fl/fl;Olig2fl/fl:PDGFB-Cre) are designated as Olig2cKO. In
contrast to robust Olig2 expression in Ctrl-T tumors, Olig2 was
essentially undetectable in Cre-expressing cells in Olig2cKO
tumors (Figure S3A). Residual Olig2+ cells observed in the
Olig2cKO tumors were not Cre-retrovirus transduced (Fig-
ure S3A), and therefore they do not have Cre-mediated Pten
and Trp53 deletion; these cells might represent non-transformed
OPCs that have been entrapped or recruited to the tumor.
To trace the growth and progression of tumors from Cre-re-
combined cells, we performed in vivo bioluminescence imaging
of the Ctrl-T and Olig2cKO mice carrying the Rosa26-tmLucifer-
ase reporter (Figure 3A). In the Ctrl-T mice with Pten and Trp53

 deletion, initial tumor formation was detected around dpi 15. Tu-
mors grew rapidly and spread extensively in the brain over time
as indicated by increasing luminescent signal (Figure 3A). Most
control tumor-forming mice died before dpi 30 (Figure 3A). In
contrast, in the Olig2cKO mice, we detected tumor appearance
at a later stage around dpi 20. Intriguingly, tumor mass continued
to expand before most Olig2cKO mice succumbed to the tumor
by around dpi 50 (Figures 3A and 3B), indicating that Olig2
ablation led to a slower rate of growth and/or a delay in tumor
initiation. However, the size of tumors monitored by lumines-
cent signals gradually increased and eventually reached a level
resembling the control tumor groups at the terminal stage of
tumor growth (Figure 3B).
Histological analyses of tumors confirmed glioma formation
and growth across time points after viral injection in Ctrl-T and
Olig2cKO mice (Figures 3C, S3B, and S3C). The glioma in
Olig2cKO mice in the end-stage tumors at dpi 40 was similar
to that of control tumors (Figures S3C–S3E), resembling human
GBM with characteristic high mitotic index and pseudopalisad-
ing necrosis. To examine the effect of Olig2 ablation on tumor
cell proliferation, we carried out bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)
pulse labeling of proliferating cells. In the Olig2cKO tumors,
Olig2 expression in the neoplasm was essentially absent,
although Sox2+/BrdU+ proliferative cells remained in the lesion
(Figure 3D). The residual Olig2+ cells expressed neither Sox2
nor BrdU, suggesting that they are not the major contributors
to the continued, albeit slower, tumor growth in Olig2cKO mice
(Figure 3D). The number of BrdU+ cells was significantly reduced
in the Olig2cKO tumors during the early stage of tumorigenesis
(Figures 3E and 3F). In late-stage tumors, however, the BrdU

 labeling was comparable between the two groups (Figures 3E
and 3F). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that Olig2 dele-
tion resulted in prolonged survival (Figure 3G), suggesting that
Olig2 deletion delays, but does not prevent, glioma initiation
and progression.
Olig2-Deleted Tumor Cells Exhibit Markedly Reduced
Sphere-Forming Capacity but Retain Tumorigenic
Capacity
We performed neurosphere formation assays to examine the
self-renewal capacity of tumor cells in the absence of Olig2.
In contrast to Ctrl-T counterparts, which formed free-floating
spheres, the Olig2-deleted tumor cells readily attached to form
a monolayer culture (Figure 4A). Primary spheres were then
dissociated and plated at clonal density over serial passages.
The control tumor cells maintained their sphere formation capac-
ity, whereas very few spheres were formed by Olig2cKO tumor
cells during passages (Figures 4A and 4B). When tumor cells
isolated from Ctrl-T and Olig2cKO neoplasms were plated as
adherent monolayers in the same mitogenic conditions, the
Olig2-deleted tumor cells were able to expand and proliferate,
as assessed by BrdU incorporation, although these cells ex-
hibited a lower proliferation rate than control tumor cells (Figures
4C and 4D).
We further analyzed the clonogenic capacity of Olig2 mutant
cells using the soft agar assay at clonal density. Ctrl-T and
Olig2cKO tumor cells were able to form colonies and displayed
similar clonogenicity; however, the overall sizes of colonies
formed by Olig2cKO tumor cells were smaller than those of
Ctrl-T cells over 20 days (Figures 4E–4G), suggesting a slower
growth rate in Olig2cKO than control tumor cells. When cultured
under neural differentiation conditions, Olig2+ tumor spheres

 differentiated into PDGFRa+ OPC-like cells along with a few
GFAP-expressing cells (Figure 4H); in contrast, the vast majority
of Olig2-deleted cells were predominantly differentiated into
GFAP+ astrocyte-like cells but not PDGFRa+ OPC-like cells
(Figure 4H), indicating that Olig2 is required for PDGFRa expres-
sion and maintenance of growth of PDGFRa+ OPC-like cells,
while suppressing astrocytic GFAP expression. Similarly, we de-
tected an upregulation of GFAP in Olig2cKO tumors (Figure S4A).
Olig2 deletion resulted in an increase of astroglial gene expres-
sion while causing a downregulation of OPC-associated gene
expression in cultured tumor cells (Figure S4B). This is consistent
with Olig2 function in control of oligodendrocyte and astrocyte
fate switch (Cai et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2012).
To investigate the tumorigenic capacity of the cells derived
from Olig2-deleted tumors in vivo, we performed orthotopic
transplantation into the cerebral striatum of immunodeficient
NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice, which were engrafted with 1 3
104 or 1 3 103 tumor cells. The cells transplanted from either
Ctrl-T or Olig2cKO tumors formed secondary tumors that resem-
bled their parental tumors histologically (Figure 5A). Kaplan-
Meier survival analysis revealed prolonged survival of mice with
secondary tumors derived from Olig2cKO tumors compared

with those derived from Ctrl-T tumors (Fig-
ure 5B). To determine the growth rate of
Olig2cKO tumor cells in the engrafted
mice, we monitored bioluminescence for
tumor development and found that Olig2-
deletion stalled progression of tumori-
genesis (Figure 5C), paralleling results in
Olig2cKO primary tumors. Similar to pri-
mary tumors, the residual Olig2+ cells in
transplanted Olig2cKO tumors were not proliferative (Figures
5D and 5E) and were without Cre expression (data not shown),
suggesting that these cells were non-transformed Olig2+ cells
residing within tumor lesions. Together, our data indicate that
Olig2-deleted tumor cells maintain tumorigenic capacity despite
a relatively slower growth rate.
Olig2 Directly Targets the Enhancers of Cell-Cycle
Regulators and Oncogenes to Regulate Their
Expression
To determine the mechanisms for Olig2 regulation of tumor
growth, we carried out transcriptome profiling of control and
Olig2cKO tumor tissues as well as normal adult cortical tis-
sues using RNA sequencing. By interrogating gene expression
signatures from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB)
(Subramanian et al., 2005), we identified that the pathways asso-
ciated with tumorigenesis including DNA replication, oncogenic
pathways, and cell proliferation were substantially activated in
Ctrl-T tumors compared with normal cortex, while those path-
ways activities were downregulated in Olig2cKO tumors (Fig-
ure 6A). Similarly, the genes downregulated in Olig2cKO tumors
compared with Ctrl-T tumors were related to the regulators of
674
Cancer Cell 29, 669–683, May 9, 2016
 cell proliferation, survival, stemness, and oncogenic programs
(Figures 6B and 6C). These observations suggest that Olig2
promotes tumorigenesis through controlling multiple oncogenic
pathways.
To identify the genes directly regulated by Olig2, we performed
whole-genome
chromatin
immunoprecipitation
sequencing
(ChIP-seq) using Olig2-expressing control tumors. The Olig2-tar-
geted genes were highly enriched in the enhancer regions,
marked by the activating histone mark H3K27ac, in the genome
of tumor tissues (Figure 6D). When comparing the Olig2 occu-
pancy profiles with those of Olig2-enriched neural progenitor
cells (NPCs) (Meijer et al., 2014), we detected a unique subset
of gene promoters/enhancers exhibiting strong Olig2 enrichment
in the neoplasm but not in normal NPCs (Figure 6E). A cohort of
Olig2-targeted sites was identified specifically in tumors (Fig-
ure 6F) but not in Olig2-enriched NPCs or OPCs (Yu et al.,
2013). These sites are mainly associated with genes known to
encode regulators of cell growth and proliferation such as cell-
cycle regulators Cdca8, Cdc20, Cdc25c, along with cell-prolifer-
ation-promoting factors Aurka and Pim1 (Figures 6G and 6H).
Strikingly, we detected a strong enrichment of Olig2 binding in
the enhancer/promoter regions of oncogenic genes, marked by
H3K27ac and H3K4me3, such as proto-oncogenes Myc and
Jun (Figure 6H). Expression of these genes is required for mainte-
nance of glioma stemcell growth (Wang et al., 2008)and has been
shown to promote cell-cycle progression and cellular prolifera-
tion (Nie et al., 2012).
To further confirm that expression of these target genes was
dependent on Olig2 expression in the tumors, we performed
qPCR analysis and found that expression of the Olig2-targeted
genes such as Cdc20, Cdc25c, Aurka, and Myc were dramati-
cally increased in the Olig2-expressing Ctrl-T tumors compared
with the wild-type corpus callosum (Figure 6I). By contrast,
transcripts from these cell-cycle-promoting genes and proto-on-
cogenes c-Myc and c-Jun were downregulated in the Olig2cKO
tumors compared with Ctrl-T tumors (Figures 6J and 6K), sug-
gesting that Olig2 transcriptionally targets the enhancers of the
genes encoding the regulators of cell growth, and activates their
expression to promote cell proliferation during tumorigenesis.
Loss of Olig2 Leads to a Proneural Phenotype Shift to an
Astroglia-Associated Classical-like Gene Expression

Given the persistent, but delayed, glioma formation in Olig2cKO
mice, we questioned whether alternative pathways sustain the
growth and progression of Olig2-deleted tumors. We therefore

 compared the transcriptome profiles of Ctrl-T and Olig2cKO
tumors. We compared these profiles with those of validated sub-
types of human GBM samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas
Project (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2008). Gene
regulatory network analysis revealed that the genes that were
highly enriched in Ctrl-T tumors were closely related to oligoden-
drogenesis and cell proliferation, and with those associated
with the proneural subtype of GBM characterized by an oligo-
dendrocytic gene expression pattern (Figures 7A and 7B). In
contrast, the genes that were over-represented in Olig2cKO
tumors were correlated with astrogliogenesis and resembled
the gene expression pattern of classical-like tumors (Figure 7B).
These observations suggest that Olig2 deletion leads to a
tumor phenotype shift. By analyzing the expression level of
signature genes identified in different GBM subtypes (Verhaak
et al., 2010) between Ctrl-T and Olig2cKO tumors, we found
that Olig2-deletion led to downregulation of proneural signature
genes and upregulation of a set of classical signature genes
(Figure 7C). Consistently, the gene sets enriched in Ctrl-T and
Olig2cKO tumors were over-represented in proneural and clas-
sical GBMs, respectively (Figure 7D).
To define potential glioma phenotype shift in an unbiased
manner, we then performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
(GSEA) (Subramanian et al., 2005) to compare the expression
pattern of Ctrl-T and Olig2cKO tumors with the datasets from
four GBM subgroups (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network,
2008; Verhaak et al., 2010). Based on GSEA, the transcriptome
profile of Ctrl-T tumors was a significant match to the signature
of the proneural subtype of GBM (Figure 7E). In contrast, signa-
ture gene sets associated with classical GBM, but not mesen-
chymal or neural subtypes, were significantly enriched in the
gene expression profile of Olig2cKO tumors (Figure 7E).
qRT-PCR analysis further confirmed that expression of a set of
astroglia-associated classical signature genes such as Egfr,
Tbx2, Gli2, and Jag1 was substantially increased in Olig2cKO
tumors (Figure 7F), whereas expression of proneural signature
genes was downregulated. Expression of mesenchymal and
neural signature genes was not significantly altered by Olig2
deletion (Figure 7F). In addition, we found that Olig2 directly
targets the regulatory regions of the classical signature genes
including Egfr, Tbx2, and Gli2 (Figure 7G). In Olig2cKO tumors,
the activating histone mark H3K27ac was significantly enriched
in enhancer regions of these genes, which were correlated with
upregulation of their expression in the absence of Olig2 (Fig-
ure 7G). This suggests that Olig2 negatively regulates expression
of these classical signature genes in glioma.
To determine whether Olig2 downregulation at the cellular
level results in a shift of gene expression patterns, we knocked
down Olig2 with lenti-shRNA in Ctrl-T tumor cells in culture.
qRT-PCR was used to examine the expression of a set of pro-
neural signature (e.g., Olig2, Dll3, Ascl1, Slc1a1, and Pdgfra)
and classical signature (e.g., Egfr, Tbx2, Gli2, and Jag1) genes
(Verhaak et al., 2010). Strikingly, we found that the inhibition of
Olig2 expression reduced proneural gene expression and led
to an increase of expression in the classical signature genes
such as Egfr compared with levels in control shRNA-treated cells
(Figure 7H).
TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) gene expression datasets
and immunohistochemistry indicated that the tumors from the
proneural GBM cohort of patients exhibit a high level of OLIG2
expression accompanied by a low level of EGFR expression,
whereas a higher EGFR level was observed in the classical sub-
type cohort than in the proneural GBM cohort (Figures 7I, 7J,
and S5A–S5C). This is in agreement with the previous observa-
tion that approximately 97% of patients with classical GBMs
have high-level EGFR expression or amplification (Verhaak
et al., 2010). Consistently, the proportion of OLIG2+ or OLIG2+/
PDGFRA+ cells in GBM tissues was higher in the proneural group
than in the classical group (Figures S5D–S5F). There is a positive
correlation between OLIG2 and PDGFRA expression among
GBMs with PDGFRA amplification in TCGA datasets (Fig-
ure S5G), however, the levels of OLIG2 and EGFR expression
are uncorrelated in TCGA core GBM samples. Although EGFR
expression in OLIG2+ cells appears variable, ranging from
absent or low to high, we observed that the percentage of
OLIG2+ cells expressing low or absent EGFR was substantially
higher than that of those with high EGFR expression in a cohort
of proneural tumors (Figure S5H), consistent with a role of OLIG2
in repression of EGFR expression.
To further correlate OLIG2 downregulation to gene expression
changes, we knocked down expression of OLIG2 by shRNA
in two primary human proneural GBM cell lines, TS543 and
TS667; both lines characterized by PDGFRA amplification
(Ozawa et al., 2014). We found that OLIG2 depletion by shRNA
knockdown resulted in a reduction in the rate of cell proliferation
as assayed by BrdU incorporation (Figures 7K and 7L). Similarly,
OLIG2 knockdown in an OLIG2-expressing glioma cell line
SU-AO2 with IDH1 mutation (Venkatesh et al., 2015) also caused
a decrease in cell proliferation (Figures S5I and S5J). Further-
more, expression of characteristic genes of classical GBM,
including EGFR, were upregulated, while PDGFRA expression
was downregulated upon treatment of cells with the OLIG2-spe-
cific shRNA in TS543 and TS667 cells (Figure 7M). Collectively,
these observations suggest that OLIG2 has a cell-autonomous
role on the phenotype of tumor cells.
Inhibition of EGFR Signaling Blocks Olig2-Deleted
Tumor Cell Proliferation
We observed that Egfr was significantly upregulated in Olig2cKO
tumors, and that Olig2 directly targets the regulatory elements of
Egfr and represses Egfr expression (Figure 7G). These results
point to EGFR signaling that sustains reduced tumorigenesis in
the Olig2cKO mice. Immunostaining and western blot analysis
indicated robust EGFR upregulation in Olig2cKO tumors in
contrast to weak EGFR expression in Ctrl-T tumors (Figures
8A–8D), while EGFR+ cells in Olig2cKO tumors were proliferative
(Figure 8B). In Olig2cKO tumors, expression of the activated
form EGFR, phospho-EGFR, was also upregulated (Figures 8C
and 8D). Similarly, downstream targets of EGFR signaling,
p-Erk and p-Akt, were increased in Olig2-deleted tumors,
whereas overall Erk and Akt levels were unchanged relative to
those in Ctrl-T tumors (Figures S6A and S6B). Consistent with
activation of EGFR signaling, expression of EGFR ligands
including EGF, HB-EGF, and TGFa were detected in Olig2cKO
tumor tissues and all human TCGA GBM tumor samples (Figures
S6C and S6D).
In contrast to EGFR, levels of PDGFRa and phospho-PDGFRa
were substantially downregulated in Olig2cKO tumors (Figures

 8C and 8D). The number of PDGFRa-expressing cells was
decreased in Olig2cKO relative to Ctrl-T tumor tissues (Figures
8E and 8F). In addition, we observed that Olig2 targets directly
the enhancer regions of the Pdgfra gene locus in glioma (Fig-
ure S6E). Collectively, these observations suggest that Olig2
negatively regulates EGFR expression while activating PDGFRa
expression in glioma.
Given that the EGFR pathway is activated in the Olig2-deleted
tumors, we tested whether tumor cells with Olig2 deletion
were sensitive to inhibition of EGFR signaling by treating tumor
cells derived from Ctrl-T and Olig2cKO tumors with gefitinib,
an EGFR inhibitor (Cataldo et al., 2011). Gefitinib treatment
exhibited a stronger inhibitory effect on the proliferation of
Olig2cKO tumor cells than Ctrl-T tumor cells as assayed by
BrdU incorporation (Figures 8G and 8H). Similar results were
also observed upon treatment of cells with erlotinib, another
EGFR inhibitor (Cataldo et al., 2011) (data not shown). The num-
ber of viable cells detected by CellTiter Glo assay (Noah et al.,
2007) was reduced significantly in Olig2-deleted cells after treat-
ment with gefitinib, while Olig2+ Ctrl-T tumor cells were less
sensitive to gefitinib treatment (Figure 8I). Furthermore, the num-
ber of cells undergoing apoptosis as marked by cleaved, active
caspase-3 was significantly higher in Olig2cKO cells in response
to treatment than in Ctrl-T tumor cells (Figures 8J and 8K), where
the majority of cleaved caspase-3+ cells did not express Olig2
(Figures S6F and S6G). These data indicated that the growth of
Olig2cKO cells is more sensitive to the EGFR inhibition than
that of Olig2-expressing Ctrl-T tumor cells. The loss of Olig2 re-
sulted in substantial reduction of PDGFRa but not PDGFRb,
which exhibited a low level in control tumors (Figures S6H–
S6J). We found that inhibition of PDGFR signaling with crenola-
nib had no significant effect on the growth of Olig2cKO tumor
cells (Figures S6K and S6L). This suggests that, in the absence
of Olig2, tumor cells likely acquire the alternative EGFR signaling
pathway to maintain growth at a reduced rate.
Next, to determine the in vivo effects of gefitinib treatment on
the tumor growth of Ctrl-T and Olig2cKO mice, we initiated drug
treatment 5 days after PDGFB-Cre retrovirus induction of tumor-
igenesis. Ctrl-T mice that received gefitinib exhibited an insig-
nificant reduction in the tumor size compared with mice that
received vehicle as assayed by bioluminescent intensity (Figures
8L and 8N). In contrast, Olig2cKO mice treated with gefitinib
showed a significant reduction in bioluminescence over the
course of treatment compared with mice treated with DMSO,
indicating that gefitinib treatment substantially delayed tumor
growth (Figures 8M and 8N). Gefitinib treatment resulted in a
significant increase in survival time of the Olig2cKO animals (Fig-
ure 8O), suggesting that Olig2 depletion sensitizes glioma cells
to EGFR signaling inhibition and improves the lifespan of the
animals.
DISCUSSION
In the present study, we demonstrate that mitotic Olig2-express-
ing cells are essential for tumor propagation in a murine model of
proneural subtype GBM, highlighting the dependency of brain
tumorigenesis on Olig2+ mitotic cells. Our findings also indicate
that Olig2 reciprocally regulates distinct growth receptor PDGFR
and EGFR signaling pathways and maintains tumor phenotype
identity. Integrative analyses of genome occupancy and tran-
scriptome profiling reveal that Olig2 directly activates a specific
subset of genes that promote cell proliferation and oncogenic
processes in the neoplasm distinct from normal NPCs. Olig2
deletion leads to a significant delay in the onset and progression
of glioma and causes a phenotype shift from an oligodendrocyte
lineage correlated proneural toward an astroglial gene expres-
sion pattern with activation of EGFR signaling. Our data indicate
a critical role for Olig2 in regulating the growth rate and pheno-
typic plasticity of both mouse and human glioma cells. We
further find that Olig2 deletion results in sensitization of glioma
cells to EGFR inhibition. Thus, our findings suggest a rationale
for blocking Olig2-expressing proneural glioma growth through
inhibiting Olig2 activity and proof of principle for targeting tu-
mor-propagating cells for stratifying therapy among distinct sub-
types of malignant gliomas.
A previous study showed that Olig1/2-null cells were unable to
form tumors in an allograft model in the presence of p53 (Ligon
et al., 2007). Tumor cells, however, in our mouse model, which
harbors deletions of Trp53 and Pten, the most frequently
mutated genes in GBM patients (Brennan et al., 2013; Verhaak
et al., 2010), are able to continue to grow in the absence of
Olig2, albeit at a slower rate, revealing a context-dependent
function of Olig2 in brain tumorigenesis. Olig2 has been shown
to repress the cell-cycle inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1 (Ligon et al.,
2007) on the wild-type p53 background, and the requirement
of Olig2 for tumor growth appears to be p53 dependent (Mehta
et al., 2011). In the Trp53/Pten mutant glioma model, however,
Olig2 deletion leads to upregulation of EGFR but not p21 (data
not shown). This is in keeping with the lack of a reciprocal rela-
tionship between Olig2 and p21 expression in glioma cells

 carrying mutated or amplified EGFR (Mehta et al., 2011).
Strikingly, our integrative genome occupancy and expression
profiling analyses reveal that Olig2 directly activates regulators
of cell-cycle and oncogenic factors in tumors but not normal
NPCs, suggesting that Olig2 acts as an accelerator of cell divi-
sion during tumorigenesis. Our findings indicate that regulation
of cell proliferation and oncogenic pathways by Olig2 is required
for full tumorigenic potential and rapid cell expansion during
tumor growth.
Olig2-deleted tumor cells exhibit increased adhesiveness,
astrocytic phenotypes, and a defect in neurosphere formation,
suggesting that Olig2 is required for the robust self-renewal of
tumor-propagating cells, consistent with the finding of Olig2 as
a key transcription factor that drives GBM (Suva et al., 2014). A
recent study indicates that self-renewal capacity, as measured
by an in vitro sphere formation assay, does not determine the
tumor growth potential of high-grade glioma (Barrett et al.,
2012). Consistent with this, our data show that, despite vastly
diminished sphere formation capacity, Olig2-deleted cells are
able to establish and form glioma, albeit at a decelerated rate.
Together, our data suggest that Olig2 promotes the growth
of tumor cells through activation of cell-proliferation activating
factors and maintenance of the proliferation potential of glioma
cells.
Recent studies indicate that TNF-a/NF-kB signaling promotes
mesenchymal differentiation of proneural GBM cells in vitro
(Bhat et al., 2013). Additional NF1 loss in a proneural glioma
model induces proneural to mesenchymal transition (Ozawa
et al., 2014). The molecular determinants that steer proneural
subtype differentiation other than the mesenchymal lineage
remain elusive. Gene profiling analysis indicates that Olig2-
deleted tumors exhibit an increased expression of the gene
signature of astrocytic classical-like GBM. In addition, Olig2
knockdown in mouse tumor cells or human proneural GBM cells
results in increased expression of a set of classical signature
genes including EGFR. Thus, although we could not completely
exclude the possibility of a change in tumor cell compositions or
microenvironment, these observations suggest that the pheno-
typic shift of Olig2cKO tumors occurs, at least in part, through
a cell-autonomous effect of Olig2 loss.
Olig2-expressing control tumor cells are highly enriched in
oligodendrocyte lineage signatures, whereas the Olig2cKO
tumor cells were characterized by upregulated expression of as-
troglial signature genes. This is consistent with the role of Olig2 in
suppressing the astroglial phenotype by inhibiting expression of
GFAP and astrogenic factors such as NFIA (Cai et al., 2007;
Glasgow et al., 2014). Our observation of an apparent shift
toward classical from proneural expression patterns based on
the TCGA classification of gliomas likely reflects a switch from
an oligodendroglial to astroglial gene expression pattern in the
absence of Olig2. It is worth noting that Olig2 deletion does not
necessarily cause a GBM subtype conversion. Rather, Olig2
deletion leads to a transcriptional program shift with apparent
upregulation of astroglia-correlated signature genes and down-
regulation of oligodendrocyte precursor-associated proneural
gene expression in our animal model.
Olig2+ mitotic cell elimination virtually abrogates tumor growth
in our animal model of proneural subtype gliomas, suggesting
mitotic Olig2-expressing cells as a seeding source for proneural
glioma growth. Although the potential role of mitotic Olig2+ cells
in other subtype tumors remains to be determined, targeted
elimination of OLIG2+ mitotic cells will be beneficial for treat-
ment of a set of malignant GBM, especially for the proneural
tumors that are enriched in mitotic OLIG2+ propagating cells.
Notably, IDH1- or IDH2-mutant gliomas are highly enriched for
OLIG2. IDH1/2 mutations cause a global DNA hypermethylation
phenotype referred to as G-CIMP (Glioma CpG Island Methylator
Phenotype) and widespread gene silencing (Brennan et al.,
2013). Compared with other OLIG2-expressing non-G-CIMP
tumors, IDH-mutant tumors are less aggressive (Joseph et al.,
2013), raising a possibility of a context-dependent role of
OLIG2 in tumor growth. Nonetheless, OLIG2 knockdown in
IDH1-mutant SU-AO2 glioma cells results in a reduction of cell
proliferation, suggesting that OLIG2 may also act as an onco-
genic factor for cell growth in IDH-mutant glioma. Collectively,
our findings suggest that Olig2 controls glioma phenotype plas-
ticity and that targeted inhibition of Olig2 sensitizes tumor cells to
EGFR inhibition. The profound impact of targeting Olig2 and
EGFR signaling on glioma formation illuminates an alternative
avenue to stratify GBM treatment with tailored pharmacological
intervention to inhibit the growth of these highly lethal malignant
brain tumors.

Mouse lines, breeding, and tissue processing used in this study are described
previously (Yue et al., 2006) and in Supplemental Information. All animal exper-
iments were approved by and performed according to the guidelines of the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Cincinnati Children’s Hos-
pital Medical Center, USA. Human PN-like subtype GBM tissues with PDGFRA
amplification and CL-like subtype GBM tissues with EGFR amplification,
CDKN2A deletion, and PTEN deletion were from the University of Cincinnati,
the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, and Sichuan University.
All human glioma samples were obtained with consent as outlined by institu-
tional review boards at the individual universities. Tissue processing and im-
munostaining procedures and antibodies used are listed in the Supplemental
Information.
Tumor Induction and Intracranial Transplantation
Gliomas induced by PDGFB-IRES-Cre retrovirus and bioluminescence imag-
ing in the Pten fl/fl;Trp53fl/fl mice were described previously (Lei et al., 2011) and
in the Supplemental Information.
Drug Infusion
Mice were anaesthetized 5 days after PDGFB-Cre retrovirus injection and im-
planted with an osmotic minipump (Model 2004; Alzet-Durect) and cannulas
(Brain Infusion Kit 3; Alzet-Durect). The infusion cannula was implanted
through the same needle tract used for virus injection by the stereotaxic appa-
ratus. The osmotic minipumps were filled up with vehicle (DMSO) or gefitinib
(80 mg/ml) (flow rate 0.25 ml/hr, resulting in delivery of 480 mg/day) and were
connected to the infusion cannulas.
Cell Culture, RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, and Data Analysis
Tumor cell isolation, culture, and sphere formation assays are described in the
Supplemental Information. RNA isolation, RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and data ana-
lyses were performed as described previously (Yu et al., 2013). Full details can
be found in the Supplemental Information.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were done using Microsoft Excel or Prism GraphPad 6.00
with Student’s two-tailed t test for comparing two sets of data. One-way
ANOVA analysis with a Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test was used
