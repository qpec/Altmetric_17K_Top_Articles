Purpose: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability. Intracranial hemorrhage
(ICH) secondary to TBI is associated with a high risk of coagulopathy which leads to increasing risk of
hemorrhage growth and higher mortality rate. Therefore, antifibrinolytic agents such as tranexamic acid
(TA) might reduce traumatic ICH. The aim of the present study was to investigate the extent of ICH
growth after TA administration in TBI patients.
Methods: This single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted on patients with traumatic ICH
(with less than 30 ml) referring to the emergency department of Vali-Asr Hospital, Arak, Iran in 2014.
Patients, based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, were divided into intervention and control groups
(40 patients each). All patients received a conservative treatment for ICH, as well as either intravenous TA
or placebo. The extent of ICH growth as the primary outcome was measured by brain CT scan after 48 h.
Results: Although brain CT scan showed a significant increase in hemorrhage volume in both groups after
48 h, it was significantly less in the TA group than in the control group (p ¼ 0.04). The mean total
hemorrhage expansion was (1.7 ± 9.7) ml and (4.3 ± 12.9) ml in TA and placebo groups, respectively
(p < 0.001).
Conclusion: It has been established that TA, as an effective hospital-based treatment for acute TBI, could
reduce ICH growth. Larger studies are needed to compare the effectiveness of different doses.

Introduction
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and
disability. Each year about 1.5 million persons die and more than 10
million persons are hospitalized following a TBI worldwide.1 A
study showed an annual incidence rate of 56.3/100,000 population
for TBI in Tehran, Iran.2 One of the most important and devastating
parts of the secondary pathologic cascade that may occur after the
initial brain injury is the progression of intracranial hemorrhage
(ICH), especially within the first 24 h.3 Its frequency varies
according to TBI severity.
ICH is also associated with a high risk of coagulopathy which
leads to increased risk of hemorrhage growth and higher mortal-
ity.4 Therefore the antifibrinolytics agents might reduce traumatic
ICH. Tranexamic acid (TA), as an antifibrinolytic, has recently been
shown to be an effective treatment of traumatic hemorrhage. In a
recent mega-trial (CRASH-2) in more than 20,000 trauma patients
with major bleeding, TA significantly reduced mortality, with no
increase in vascular occlusive events.5 Analysis of a TBI sub-group
(n ¼ 270) showed a trend toward less mortality with TA.6,7 A sys-
tematic review demonstrated statistically significant reduction in
ICH
progression
with
TA
and
a
non-statistically
significant
improvement of clinical outcomes in TBI patients.8 To date, there
has been no study to determine the extent of ICH expansion after
TA administration and also the optimal dose of TA in TBI patients.

 The present study aims to investigate the extent of ICH growth after
TA administration in TBI patients.
Materials and methods
The patients with acute traumatic ICH were successively
enrolled in this single-blinded, controlled, randomized trial at the
emergency department of Vali-Asr Hospital, Arak, Iran in 2014. The
study was approved by Research Ethics Committee, Arak University
of Medical Sciences. The TBI patients aged 15 years and more,
within 2 h of injury onset, and with acute ICH (volume of less than
30 ml) based on CT scan findings, were eligible for the trial. The
exclusion criteria were: (1) Glasgow coma scale (GCS) total score
<8; (2) unknown onset time; (3) ICH volume more than 30 ml as
measured by CT scan; (4) need for surgery; (5) presence of focal
neurologic deficits; (6) subarachnoid hemorrhage; (7) the cerebral
edema with midline shift; (8) use of TA within the previous 14 d; (9)
hereditary or acquired hemorrhagic diathesis or coagulation factor
deficiency; (10) creatinine > 20 mg/L; (11) pregnancy (women of
child bearing potential must be tested); (12) history or current
evidence suggestive of venous or arterial thrombotic events,
including deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, cerebral vein
thrombosis, cerebrovascular accident; (13) history of hypersensi-
tivity to TA; and (14) history of acquired color blindness or visual
vascular problems.
Informed consent was obtained from patients or their relative
or representative. Initial brain CT scan was done immediately after
admission and routine care. The baseline data including de-
mographic data, mechanism of injury, and findings of initial brain
CT scan (especially ICH volume) were entered. Then, included
patients were randomized to get either the intervention or pla-
cebo treatment based on a computer-generated code list (40 pa-
tients in each group). Multiplicity adjustment was also done
regarding to age, gender, and systolic blood pressure. All patients
received a conservative treatment for ICH, and either intravenous
TA (a bolus of 1 g in 100 ml 0.9% NaCl over 10 min followed by a
continuous infusion of 1 g in 500 ml 0.9% NaCl over 8 h)9 or
unobvious placebo.
The extent of ICH growth as the primary outcome at 48 h after
admission was measured by brain CT scan. We estimated a 60% rate
of ICH growth in placebo patients, according to the previous
studies.10 We planned to randomize 80 patients, 40 to each group.
This trial would have about 80% power at the 0.05 level of signifi-
cance (two-sided test) to distinguish a significant difference of 30%
in the proportion of patients with ICH growth at 48 h.
An emergency medicine specialist who was blind to treatment
allocation and clinical findings evaluated the first and second scans.
Both baseline and 48 h ICH volumes were compared between
treatment and placebo groups adjusted for baseline volume. Any
intraventricular hemorrhage components were excluded in ICH
volumes.
Results
We recruited 80 patients (40 allocated to TA and 40 allocated to
placebo) in 2014. Baseline characteristics of the included patients
are shown in Table 1. Brain CT scan taken at 48 h after TBI showed a
significant
increase
in
hemorrhage
volume
in
both
groups
(p < 0.001). But the increased ICH volume in the TA group was
significantly less than that in the control group (p ¼ 0.04, Table 2).
The mean total hemorrhage expansion was (1.7 ± 9.7) ml and
(4.3 ± 12.9) ml in the TA and placebo groups, respectively
(p < 0.001).
Discussion
Our study showed that TA could reduce ICH growth after TBI.
Other
studies
demonstrated
reduction
in
ICH
progression,
too.6,8,11,12 The release of thromboplastin after TBI is followed by the
activation of the coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways.13 Increased
fibrinolysis, distinguished by high levels of fibrinogen degradation
products, is a main cause of coagulopathy in TBI, raising the prob-
ability that TA can decrease traumatic ICH.14 Therefore, the earlier
TA is administered, the more likely it will stop complete activation
of fibrinolysis.15
On the other hand, other studies demonstrated no improvement
of clinical outcomes in TBI patients with TA.8,11 CRASH-2 collabo-
rators although reported that TA significantly reduced all-cause
mortality,5 in a subgroup analysis of traumatic ICH patients, TA
showed non-significant trend to reduce mortality or dependency.6
They found that neither moderate benefits nor moderate harmful
effects of TA can be excluded after TBI. Also, Harvey et al16 showed
that there was no evidence of TA benefit in TBI patients. Valle et al17
reported that TA increased mortality in high injury acuity patients
which can probably be attributed to the rapid availability of fluids
and emergency operative interventions at the trauma centers.
In our study, the patients in TA group received two doses of TA (a
bolus and a continuous infusion) as soon as possible after admis-
sion. The timing of TA administration and the existing status of the
coagulation
system
(anticoagulation
or
procoagulation
state)
would determine whether thromboembolism formation is pre-
vented or facilitated.18 Gruen and Mitra15 confirmed that the
benefit was only seen when TA was administered within 3 h of
injury. Also, Lipsky et al19 reported that sooner administration of TA
improved the survival further. Valle et al17 reported that mortality
associated with TA was influenced by the timing of administration.
In the present study, there was not any side effect of TA
administration. Robert et al20 confirmed the safety of TA in a wide
spectrum of patients with traumatic bleeding, even the most
severely injured. A study showed that TA had no significant

 increase in serious prothrombotic complications if administered
within 3 h of injury.16 Zehtabchi et al18 declared the use of TA was
not associated with significant (clinically or statistically) increase in
the possibility of thromboembolic events compared with placebo
or standard therapy in TBI.
There are some limitations that must be considered. This study
was a single-blinded trial, whereas a double or triple-blinded trial
would be more accurate. Meanwhile, the time period between
trauma occurrence and TA administration had to be considered
more precisely.
Further,
markers
of
coagulopathy
were not
measured. In conclusion, it has established that TA as an effective
hospital-based treatment for acute TBI could reduce ICH growth.
Larger studies are needed to compare the effectiveness of different
doses.
