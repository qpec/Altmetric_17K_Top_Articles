IntroductIon
Advances in the isolation (Scheid et al., 2009, 2011) and 
screening (Walker et al., 2009) of antibody (Ab) receptors 
from the surface of HIV-specific B cells has led to the iden-
tification of hundreds of HIV-1 Env-specific Abs able to 
potently neutralize a wide breadth of HIV-1 genetic variants 
(Mascola and Haynes, 2013; Burton and Hangartner, 2016), 
and to protect against HIV-1 in both humans and animal 
models (Mascola et al., 2000; Balazs et al., 2011; Shingai et 
al., 2014; Caskey et al., 2015; Scheid et al., 2016). Charac-
terization of these broadly neutralizing Abs (bnAbs) reveal 
they recognize several conserved, less immunogenic neu-
tralizing epitopes on the HIV-1 Env protein, but they are 
relatively rare and develop only years after infection (West 
et al., 2014). Thus, a major focus of current research is to 
determine how to elicit these type of bnAbs more gener-
ally through vaccination (de Taeye et al., 2016). These Abs 
harbor several unusual features, including a long hydropho-
bic Ig heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 
(CDR3), unusually short Ig light chain CDR3 sequences, 
and a high mutation burden in both CDR and frame-
work Ig regions. Moreover, they often display polyreactive/
autoreactive specificities, which includes recognition of 
self-antigens (Mascola and Haynes, 2013; West et al., 2014; 
Liu et al., 2015) such as phosphoplipids, ubiquitin ligase 3, 
and double-stranded dsDNA (Haynes et al., 2005b; Bon-
signori et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2015).
The autoreactivity displayed by a subset of HIV-1 
bnAbs has led to the proposal that immunological tolerance 
may impede the antibody response by B cells expressing these 
bnAbs (Haynes et al., 2005b, 2016; Verkoczy et al., 2011b). 
Support for this hypothesis has shown that developing B cells 
expressing a characterized bnAb autoreactive specificity are 
eliminated by central B cell tolerance in the bone marrow 
(Verkoczy et al., 2010, 2011a, 2013; Doyle-Cooper et al., 
2013; Zhang et al., 2016). However, whether peripheral B 
cells expressing HIV-1–neutralizing but autoreactive specific-
ities are similarly constrained by peripheral tolerance has been 
less carefully examined.
Additional evidence that autoreactive specificities are 
able to recognize HIV-1 Env comes from analyses of sera 
from autoimmune individuals (Barthel and Wallace, 1993; 
Mylonakis et al., 2000; Carugati et al., 2013) and autoim-
mune prone mice (Kion and Hoffmann, 1991; Lombardi et 
al., 1993) that harbor HIV-1–specific Abs in the absence of 
infection. Moreover, the incidence of HIV-1 infection in in-
dividuals with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is lower 
than anticipated (Kaye, 1989; Barthel and Wallace, 1993; Pala-
cios et al., 2002; Palacios and Santos, 2004) and recently, a SLE 
patient was discovered to harbor plasma able to neutralize a 
wide breadth of HIV-1 strains and to control HIV-1 infec-
tion in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (Bonsignori et 
A subset of characterized HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) are polyreactive with additional specificities for 
self-antigens and it has been proposed immunological tolerance may present a barrier to their participation in protective 
humoral immunity. We address this hypothesis by immunizing autoimmune-prone mice with HIV-1 Envelope (Env) and char-
acterizing the primary antibody response for HIV-1 neutralization. We find autoimmune mice generate neutralizing antibody 
responses to tier 2 HIV-1 strains with alum treatment alone in the absence of Env. Importantly, experimentally breaching 
immunological tolerance in wild-type mice also leads to the production of tier 2 HIV-1–neutralizing antibodies, which increase 
in breadth and potency following Env immunization. In both genetically prone and experimentally induced mouse models of 
autoimmunity, increased serum levels of IgM anti-histone H2A autoantibodies significantly correlated with tier 2 HIV-1 neu-
tralization, and anti-H2A antibody clones were found to neutralize HIV-1. these data demonstrate that breaching peripheral 
tolerance permits a cross-reactive HIV-1 autoantibody response able to neutralize HIV-1.
Breaching peripheral tolerance promotes the production 
of HIV-1–neutralizing antibodies

 Tolerance limits neutralizing HIV-1 antibody responses | Schroeder et al.
2284
al., 2014). Thus, although evidence exists that autoimmune 
individuals harbor serum antibodies that recognize HIV-1 
Env and are autoreactive, whether breaking immunological 
tolerance can facilitate production of HIV-1–neutralizing an-
tibodies remains unknown.
Autoreactive B cells are generally eliminated or silenced 
by mechanisms of tolerance. T
olerance of B cells initially 
manifests in the bone marrow as central tolerance acting on 
immature B cells expressing their newly formed antibody as a 
receptor (Goodnow et al., 2005; Nemazee, 2006; Pelanda and 
Torres, 2006). In both humans and mice, 55–75% of newly 
expressed antibody receptors are autoreactive (Grandien et al., 
1994; 
Wardemann et al., 2003), and approximately half of these 
are censored by central B cell tolerance (Casellas et al., 2001). 
Autoreactive B cells with weak autoreactivity escape central 
tolerance and enter the peripheral lymphoid compartments 
of healthy individuals and wild-type mice (Pugh-Bernard et 
al., 2001; 
Wardemann et al., 2003; Merrell et al., 2006; Koelsch 
et al., 2007) where peripheral tolerance renders them func-
tionally anergic and short-lived (Cambier et al., 2007).
In this study, we addressed whether breaching immu-
nological tolerance promotes the development of neutral-
izing HIV-1 antibody responses using mouse models. Mice 
are not a natural host for HIV-1 but can generate HIV-1–
reactive Abs upon immunization, although typically unable 
to neutralize HIV-1. We show that autoimmune-prone, but 
not wild-type healthy, strains of mice can be induced by 
adjuvant alone to produce antibodies that neutralize tier 2 
HIV-1 variants. Importantly, we further demonstrate that 
when immunological tolerance in wild-type healthy mice is 
breached experimentally, antibodies neutralizing tier 2 HIV-1 
strains can be elicited and are enhanced in potency by Env 
immunization. Thus, our findings formally demonstrate that 
peripheral immunological tolerance limits the production of 
neutralizing HIV-1 antibody responses by B cells expressing a 
wild-type antibody repertoire.

Wild-type and B6.sle123 mice mount a similar 
Env-specific IgG, but not IgM, primary antibody response
To evaluate the contribution of tolerance on the production 
of anti–HIV-1 antibodies, we first compared the primary an-
ti-Env antibody response in wild-type B6 and autoimmune 
prone B6.Sle123 mice. B6.Sle123 is a model strain of lupus 
autoimmunity generated by introducing three distinct auto-
immune-prone loci from the NZM2410 strain into the B6 
strain (Morel et al., 1994). Similar to NZM2410, B6.Sle123 
mice are characterized by impaired mechanisms of B cell 
tolerance and the presence of antinuclear antibodies in both 
females and males (Morel et al., 1994). Important to this 
study, B6.Sle123 mice are also congenic with B6 mice, and 
thus bear the same Ig variable gene segments. Age-matched 
(2–9-mo-old) 
WT B6 and autoimmune B6.Sle123 mice were 
immunized with alum alone or together with Env and either 
monomeric gp120 (ADA) or trimeric gp140 (YU2). We then 
measured the levels of gp120-specific IgM and IgG antibod-
ies in serum 7 and 14 d later by ELI 
SA. On pathogen en-
counter, antigen-specific IgM is the first Ig isotype produced 
to limit pathogen spread during the time class-switched 
IgG isotypes are generated and which are better suited to 
clear the offending pathogen, (Swanson et al., 2013). As ex-
pected, B6 mice immunized with Env + alum mounted a 
gp120-specific IgM response by day 14 that was >3-fold in-
creased over preimmune levels (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, sera 
from naive B6.Sle123 mice already harbored high preimmu-
nization titers of gp120-reactive IgM (∼3-fold increased over 
B6), but these titers did not increase further following alum 
or Env + alum immunization (Fig. 1 A). Polyclonal B cell 
activation is a feature of lupus prone mice (Klinman, 1990) 
that can lead to increased total Ig levels. Indeed, while total 
serum IgM levels did not increase with immunization in ei-
ther wild-type or autoimmune prone mice (Fig. 1 B), total 
IgM levels were significantly higher in B6.Sle123 compared 
with B6 mice (Fig. 1 B).
In contrast to the IgM response, both B6 and B6.Sle123 
mice mount gp120-specific IgG antibody responses after 
immunization with Env + alum (Fig. 1 C). All Env-specific 
IgG isotypes, with the exception of IgG3, were similarly and 
significantly increased over alum in both strains (Fig. 1 C). 
However, the B6.Sle123 IgG1 anti-gp120 response, while 
considerable, was reduced compared with that in B6 mice. 
T
otal IgG concentrations were modestly increased after Env 
+ alum immunization relative to naive and alum-treated in 
B6 mice, whereas they remained unchanged in B6.Sle123 
mice (Fig. 1 D). Nevertheless, total IgG levels were sig-
nificantly higher in B6.Sle123 mice compared with B6 in 
all conditions (Fig. 1 D).
These data show that B6 mice mount typical 
T
-dependent antigen-specific IgM and IgG antibody re-
sponses to Env immunization, whereas B6.Sle123 mice har-
bor preexisting high titers of gp120-reactive IgM that does 
not change with immunization, but also mount a normal IgG 
gp120-specific antibody response.
Immunization of autoimmune-prone mice with adjuvant 
alone induces antibodies that neutralize multiple 
tier 1 and 2 HIV-1 strains
We next asked whether the Env-specific antibody response 
elicited in mice was able to neutralize HIV-1 using a stan-
dardized in vitro TZMbl assay (Sarzotti-Kelsoe et al., 2014). 
Serum neutralization was tested against a panel of four HIV-1 
clade B viruses representing the neutralization-sensitive tier 1 
and neutralization-resistant tier 2 virus strains: SF162.LS (tier 
1A), BaL.26 (tier 1B), JRFL (tier 2), and 
YU2 (tier 2) (Seaman 
et al., 2010; Chakrabarti et al., 2013). These results revealed 
that sera from B6 mice was essentially devoid of neutraliz-
ing activity against HIV-1 (Fig. 2), consistent with previous 
findings (Dosenovic et al., 2012; McCoy and Weiss, 2013). 
In contrast, the immune sera from ∼50% of the B6.Sle123 
mice was able to neutralize tier 1A or tier 2 strains (Fig. 2 
 2285
JEM Vol. 214, No. 8
and Fig. S1 A). Neutralizing activity was present in the sera 
of B6.Sle123 mice from 13 to 36 wk of age, but increased in 
mice over 4 mo of age (Fig. 2 A). 
T
o determine the specificity 
of this viral neutralization, neutralization was also tested for 
murine leukemia virus (muLV) and <1/3 of the Env + alum 
immune serum samples that were able to neutralize HIV-1 
also demonstrated weak neutralizing activity for muLV sug-
gesting that the elicited neutralizing antibodies were relatively 
HIV-1 specific (Fig. 2 A).
Because naive B6.Sle123 mice harbored preexisting high 
titers of Env-reactive IgM, we next asked if Env was required 
as an immunogen to elicit neutralization. Unexpectedly, sera 
from B6.Sle123 mice treated with alum alone harbored anti-
bodies able to neutralize tier 1B BaL.26, as well as both tier 2 
JRFL and 
YU2 strains, but not tier 1A SF162.LS (Fig. 2 C). In 
contrast, serum HIV-1 neutralization was rarely observed and 
significantly reduced in naive B6.Sle123 mice compared with 
alum-treated (P = 0.028) or Env + alum–immunized (P = 
0.017) mice (Fig. 2 D), and was not observed in age-matched, 
B6 mice injected with alum alone (unpublished data).
Mouse immune sera has been reported to neutralize 
HIV-1, but this was subsequently found to have erroneously 
resulted from an unappreciated cytotoxicity resulting from 
immunization with formaldehyde-fixed cells (LaCasse et al., 
1999; Nunberg, 2002). It was thus important to determine 
if serum Ig from B6.Sle123 mice was indeed responsible 
for HIV-1 neutralization and to assess the specificity of this 
neutralization. Accordingly, Ig was purified from B6.Sle123 
HIV-1–neutralizing sera and found to also display neutral-
izing activity against one or both tier 2 HIV-1 strains with 
IC50 <100 µg/ml (Fig. S2). In contrast, Ig purified from non-
neutralizing B6 immune sera did not display any neutraliz-
ing activity. From these analyses, we conclude that the HIV-1 
neutralization observed in the sera of both alum alone and

Env + alum immunized B6.Sle123 mice is relatively spe-
cific to HIV-1 and is mediated by immunoglobulin and not 
another serum component.
T
o determine if Env immunization influenced the po-
tency of neutralization, the mean neutralization titers were 
calculated for both alum- and Env-immunized B6.Sle123 
mice that displayed neutralization activity for each virus 
(Fig. 2 E). These findings show that Env immunization of 
B6.Sle123 mice increases the potency of neutralizing serum 
for tier 1A SF162.LS virus (800× increase), but not for any 
other HIV-1 variant. Comparing the relative breadth of neu-
tralization between B6.Sle123 mice treated with alum alone 
or Env + alum revealed both treatments promoted a similar 
frequency (54 vs. 48%, respectively) of mice able to neutralize 
one or more viruses (Fig. 2 F). Thus, autoimmune B6.Sle123 
mice mount an Env-specific antibody response that is able to 
neutralize tier 1A SF162.LS virus, whereas neutralization of 
tier 1B BaL.26 and tier 2 HIV-1 variants JRFL and 
YU2 can 
be elicited by alum alone.
To determine whether the elicited HIV-1–neutralizing 
activity was restricted to the B6.Sle123 autoimmune mouse 
model, we similarly treated lupus prone MRL/lpr mice (8–16 
wk of age) with alum alone or with Env + alum and mea-
sured HIV-1–neutralizing activity in serum 2 wk later. In 
these experiments, MRL/lpr mouse sera displayed HIV-1 
neutralization properties similar to those of B6.Sle123 mice 
(Fig. 3), but differed in that sera from MRL/lpr mice was 
also able to neutralize tier 1A SF162.LS after alum treatment 
alone (Fig. 3 A). Additionally, a higher percentage of MRL/
lpr mice neutralized one or more strains of HIV-1 (60–82%; 
Fig. 3 B) compared with B6.Sle123 mice (48–54%; Fig. 2 F) 
and neutralization against all 4 HIV-1 strains, albeit weak, was 
observed in the sera of naive MRL/lpr, but not B6.Sle123, 
mice (unpublished data).
Overall, these data reveal that the treatment of auto-
immune prone mice with alum alone is sufficient to in-
duce the production of antibodies capable of neutralizing 
tier 1 and 2 HIV-1 strains.
HIV-1 neutralization correlates with 
total IgM levels and age
Approximately 50% of the treated B6.Sle123 mice produced 
HIV-1–neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 2). Thus, we asked if 
any parameters were uniquely associated with B6.Sle123 
mice able to neutralize HIV-1 (neutralizers) compared with 
mice unable to neutralize HIV-1 (nonneutralizers). Spe-
cifically, we evaluated mouse age (Fig. 4 A), serum Ig lev-
els (Fig. 4, B and C), and specificity to two autoantigens 
representing common lupus-associated autoreactive speci-
ficities (chromatin; Fig. 4 D and the RNA-binding Smith 
antigen; Fig. 4 E), as well as cardiolipin, a previously re-
ported autoreactive specificity for HIV-1 bnAbs (Fig. 4 F; 
Haynes et al., 2005a).
From these analyses, total serum IgM levels provided 
a significant correlation with B6.Sle123 neutralizers com-
pared with B6.Sle123 nonneutralizers and wild-type B6 mice 
(Fig. 4, B and C; and not depicted). There was a tendency 
for B6.Sle123 neutralizers to be older relative to B6.Sle123 
nonneutralizers, although this difference was not statistically 
significant (Fig. 4 A). Serum IgM and IgG autoantibody titers 
against chromatin, Smith antigen, and cardiolipin were also 
not significantly different between neutralizers and nonneu-
tralizers (Fig. 4 D-F), although the mean IgM and IgG anti-
chromatin titers trended higher in HIV-1 neutralizers relative 
to nonneutralizers. These data show that B6.Sle123 neutral-
izers tend to be older and have higher serum IgM levels, but 
do not generally exhibit increased serum titers for three com-
mon autoantigen specificities.
Figure 3. neutralization of HIV-1 is observed in Mrl/lpr mice. MRL/lpr mice (8–16 wk old) were immunized with alum (n = 5) or Env + alum (n = 
11), sacrificed day 14 pi, and analyzed for neutralization. The ID50 is calculated as in Fig. 2. (A) The mean ID50 was calculated for the responders per virus for 
MRL/lpr Env immunized (filled bars) and alum injected (open bars) mice. Data are plotted as the geometric mean ± SEM. (B) The percentage of responding 
MRL/lpr alum (left, 60%) and Env (right, 82%) immunized mice was similar (P = 0.55). Statistics were calculated using Fisher’s exact test. Data are shown 
from two independent experiments.

B6.sle123 mice that neutralize HIV-1 have higher titers of 
histone H2A-reactive IgM. 
 T
o further assess potential autore-
active specificities that correlate with the ability to neutralize 
HIV-1, sera from B6.Sle123 neutralizers, nonneutralizers and 
wild-type B6 mice were interrogated with an autoantigen 
array of 95 known autoantigens (Li et al., 2007). 
The results of 
this analysis for common lupus-associated autoantigens are 
shown in Fig. 5 A. Neutralizers and nonneutralizers exhibited 
similar serum levels of IgG autoantibodies reactive with H2A, 
H2B, or total histones, as well as IgM antibodies against H2B 
and total histones, DNA-associated autoantigens, or the La, 
Ro/SSA, or Smith RNA–binding proteins (Fig. 5 A). Among 
all autoantigens tested, only IgM anti-histone H2A titers were 
significantly elevated in B6.Sle123 neutralizers relative to 
nonneutralizers. This finding was further confirmed by ELI 
SA showing that neutralizers had significantly higher serum 
titers of H2A-reactive IgM compared with the nonneutraliz-
ers (Fig. 5 B; P = 0.005). In contrast, the IgM anti-H2B was 
similar between both cohorts of B6.Sle123 (Fig. 5 B; P = 
0.17). These results demonstrate that IgM anti-H2A serum 
titers correlate with the ability of B6.Sle123 mice to 
 
neutralize HIV-1.
Experimental breach of immunological tolerance in c57Bl/6 
mice facilitates the production of HIV-1–neutralizing anti-
bodies. 
 Our data show that autoimmune-prone strains of 
mice treated with alum produce HIV-1–neutralizing anti-
bodies, and this activity correlates with increased anti-H2A 
IgM autoantibody titers. B cells capable of producing antinu-
clear antibodies are present in the blood and peripheral lym-
phoid compartments of both healthy individuals and wild- 
type mice (Li et al., 2011). These autoreactive B cells are gen-

erally anergic, but at times can participate in an antibody re-
sponse to foreign antigens (Sabouri et al., 2014; Reed et al., 
2016). Thus, we next considered if peripheral autoreactive B 
cells able to neutralize HIV-1 exist in wild-type mice but are 
normally restrained by immunological tolerance. T
o address 
this, we experimentally compromised immunological toler-
ance in adult B6 mice (Fig. 6 A) by treatment with the iso-
prenoid alkane, 2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane (pristane), 
which promotes lupus-like autoantibodies within 1 mo and 
disease, including renal pathology and proteinuria, within 5–6 
mo in various wild-type mouse strains (Satoh and Reeves, 
1994; Satoh et al., 2000; Kuroda et al., 2004; Summers et al., 
2010). Indeed, 30 d after pristane treatment of adult B6 mice 
we observed measureable titers of chromatin reactive serum 
IgM and IgG by ELI 
SA (unpublished data). At this time point, 
mice were immunized twice 2 wk apart with alum alone or 
with Env (trimeric YU2 gp140) + alum and sera tested for 
neutralization before and after immunization.
1 mo after pristane treatment alone, ∼42% of B6 mice 
harbored weakly neutralizing sera for a tier 2 HIV-1 strain 
(36% for JRFL, 31% for YU2, and 14% for both), but sur-
prisingly not for tier 1 HIV-1 strains (Fig. 6, B and E). T
wo 
immunizations with either alum alone or Env + alum in-
creased the percentage of tier 2 neutralizers twofold (68% for 
JFRL; 75% for YU2) and induced a minority of mice (18%) 
to also neutralize tier 1 viruses (Fig. 6, C and E). Further, 
pristane-treated mice immunized twice with alum or Env + 
alum had significantly higher neutralization titers against tier 
2 HIV-1 strains than mice treated with pristane alone (Fig. 6, 
C and F; and Fig. S1 B). Importantly, the neutralization of 
tier 2 HIV-1 strains after two immunizations of either alum 
or Env + alum again appeared relatively specific to HIV-1, 
as <20% of the HIV-1–neutralizing sera also (weakly) neu-
tralized muLV (Fig. 6 C).
Pristane-treated mice given alum alone neutralized tier 
2 HIV-1 at similar frequencies (75%) as those immunized 
with Env + alum (Fig. 6 C). T
o understand if Env immu-
nization influenced the neutralizing antibody response, both 
cohorts of pristane-treated mice were compared and analyzed 
individually for potency of HIV-1–neutralizing activity. 
These 
data revealed that immunization with Env resulted in a signif-
icant increase in the ID50 relative to the sera from mice treated

the potency of the neutralizing antibody response against tier 
2 HIV-1 strains in pristane-treated wild-type mice.
A cohort of pristane-treated mice were immunized a 
third time with Env + alum to explore if an additional boost 
would further increase the potency or breadth of HIV-1 
neutralization. Interestingly, after a third immunization 87% 
of mice could neutralize tier 1A SF162.LS (Fig. 6, D and 
H), but with a concomitant loss of ability to neutralize tier 
2 HIV-1 (Fig. 6 I). These data suggest that multiple Env im-
munizations of pristane-treated mice ultimately leads to an 
antibody response focused on gp120 neutralization epitopes 
specific for the easily neutralized tier 1 SF162.LS HIV-1 vari-
ant over tier 2 strains.
T
o confirm that pristine-treated B6 mice maintain the 
ability to mount an antigen-specific antibody response as 
reported (Weinstein et al., 2008), we measured Env-specific 
IgM and IgG isotypes after Env immunization. These re-
sults show that pristane-treated B6 mice immunized with 
Env mounted antigen (Env)-specific IgM and IgG anti-
body responses that were comparable after 2 or 3 Env im-
munizations and were considerably elevated over alum alone 
(Fig. 6 J and not depicted).
Together, these data show that an experimental 
breach of immunological tolerance in wild-type mice pro-
motes the production of antibodies able to neutralize tier 
2 strains of HIV-1. Importantly, these mice retain the abil-
ity to mount Env-specific antibody responses that further 
increase the percentage of mice neutralizing tier 2 HIV-1 
variants and the effectiveness of these antibodies. However, 
continued Env immunization ultimately focuses the anti-
body response on gp120-neutralizing epitopes restricted 
to tier 1 HIV-1 strains.
neutralization of tier 2 HIV-1 strains by Env immunized pris-
tane-treated mice correlates with elevated levels of IgM an-
ti-histone H2A. 
 Long chain hydrocarbons are known to act as 
adjuvants (Wilner et al., 1963), and pristane has been shown 
to promote polyclonal B cell activation and antibody secre-
tion in mice (Kuroda et al., 2004). Thus, we measured total Ig 
serum levels 1 mo after pristane treatment of B6 mice, and 
after serial Env immunizations. These analyses showed that 
total IgM levels increased significantly 30 d after pristane 
treatment and again after two Env immunizations (Fig. 7 A). 
A third Env immunization, however, did not further increase 
total IgM levels significantly (Fig. 7 A). Pristane treatment 
also led to a significant increase in total IgG levels that were 
also increased after two Env immunizations (Fig. 7 B). In 
contrast to IgM, a third Env immunization did further in-
crease IgG serum levels (Fig. 7 B), consistent with an ongoing 
class-switched Env-specific IgG response.
Elevated serum levels of IgM anti-H2A correlate with 
HIV-1 neutralization in alum-treated autoimmune-prone 
B6.Sle123 mice (Fig. 5). Thus, we measured IgM anti-H2A 
titers in pristane-treated B6 mice before and after Env immu-
nization. 
These results show that anti-H2A IgM titers increase 
modestly 30 d after pristane treatment alone relative to naive 
mice and are significantly increased further after two Env im-
munizations (Fig. 7 C). After a third Env immunization of 
pristane-treated B6 mice, however, IgM anti-H2A autoan-
tibody titers declined significantly (Fig. 7 C). The reduced 
IgM anti-H2A autoantibody titers after 3 Env immunizations 
correlated with a reduced frequency and potency of tier 2 
HIV-1 neutralization and with increased neutralization of tier 
1 HIV-1 strains (Fig. 6 D). Stratification of pristane-treated 
mice into tier 2 neutralizers and nonneutralizers revealed that 
tier 2 neutralizers again harbor significantly higher titers of 
anti- H2A IgM compared to tier 2 nonneutralizers (Fig. 7 D). 
In contrast, anti-histone H2B IgM titers were comparable be-
tween these cohorts (Fig. 7 E). These findings alongside our 
data on autoimmune B6.Sle123 mice demonstrate that an-
ti-histone H2A IgM titers are significantly associated with the 
ability of mouse sera to neutralize tier 2 HIV-1 strains.
Histone H2A-reactive IgM monoclonal antibodies isolated 
from B6.sle123 mice neutralize tier 2 strains of HIV-1 and 
recognize Env. 
 Our data thus far demonstrate a significant 
correlation between the presence of serum tier 2 HIV-1 neu-
tralization and increased titers of histone H2A-reactive IgM 
in both a genetically predisposed and pristane-induced auto-
immune mouse model. T
o better understand the basis for this 
correlation, we generated hybridomas with splenocytes iso-
lated from B6.Sle123 mice immunized 14 d previously with 
Env + alum and that displayed serum neutralization of tier 2 
HIV-1 strains (Fig. 2 A). Monoclonal antibodies derived from 
these hybridomas were screened for reactivity to histone 
H2A by ELI 
SA and subsequently characterized for additional 
autoreactive specificities, as well as specificity to HIV-1 Env, 
including HIV-1 neutralization. From these hybridomas, five 
IgM and two IgG mAbs were found to be H2A reactive 
(Fig. 8 B). Importantly, two of these five histone H2A-reactive 
IgM mAbs (Sle P4E4 and Sle O4C5, shown in red in Fig. 8), 
isolated from different mice, displayed relatively potent neu-
tralizing activity against both tier 2 strains of HIV-1, JRFL, 
and YU2, but not tier 1 SF162.LS or BaL.26 (Fig. 8 A 
 
and Fig. S1 C).
We further assessed the specificities of these purified 
mAbs against chromatin autoantigens and HIV-1 Enve-
lope proteins by ELI 
SA, using the same range of concen-
trations tested in the TZMbl assay (0.023–50 µg/ml). These 
data revealed that these neutralizing IgM antibodies also dis-

played slight reactivity against histone H2B and chromatin 
(Fig. 8 B), suggesting these antibodies may recognize a qua-
ternary epitope on dsDNA/H2A/H2B nucleosomes. Lastly, 
we tested the hybridomas for reactivity against HIV-1 En-
velope proteins to potentially explain why only two out of 
the five histone H2A-reactive IgM antibodies neutralized 
HIV-1. From these analyses, we found that only the two neu-
tralizing histone H2A-reactive IgM antibodies recognized 
both gp140 (YU2) and the gp120 CD4-binding site (CD4bs, 
RSC3; Fig. 8 B). IgM recognition of the CD4bs was found 
to be specific, as we saw a considerable loss of reactivity with 
a mutated (null) CD4bs (ΔRSC3), as reported with other 
CD4bs-specific bnAbs, such as VRC01 (Wu et al., 2010). 
From these mAbs, we conclude that a subset of polyreactive 
IgM antibodies recognize both histone H2A and neutralizing 
epitopes on the HIV-1 Envelope protein.
dIscussIon
A subset of HIV-1 bnAbs have been characterized to rec-
ognize both a neutralizing Env epitope and a self-antigen 
(Haynes et al., 2005a; 
Yang et al., 2013; Bonsignori et al., 2014; 
Liu et al., 2015). Our data extend these findings to include 
an additional HIV-1–neutralizing polyreactive antibody that 
recognizes histone H2A. Based on these previous findings, 
it has been postulated that tolerance may pose a hurdle for 
Env-specific autoreactive B cells from mounting an HIV-1 
antibody response. Indeed, it has been shown that central B 
cell tolerance can prevent the development of certain HIV-1–
neutralizing clones (Haynes et al., 2005a,b; Verkoczy et al., 
2011b). We have examined an important correlate of this hy-
pothesis by investigating if breaching immunological toler-
ance is able to promote protective HIV-1 humoral immunity. 
Here, using lupus prone mouse models, we confirm that im-
munological tolerance indeed limits wild-type B cells from 
producing Env-specific antibodies able to neutralize tier 2 
HIV-1 strains. We extend these findings by further formally 
demonstrating that a breach in peripheral tolerance can lead 
to the production of HIV-1–neutralizing antibodies in mice 
with wild-type immune systems.
Previous studies have evaluated the role of tolerance 
in the regulation of B cells that express autoreactive HIV-1 
bnAb specificities (i.e., 2F5, 4E10) by generating Ig knock-in

(regardless of treatment with pristane alone, alum alone, or Env + alum) were separated based on neutralization of ≥1 tier 2 HIV-1 strains and measured 
for (D) IgM anti-H2A or (E) IgM anti-H2B relative titers. Mice neutralizing only tier 1 strains were included in the tier 2 nonneutralizer group (mostly 3X).

mice. Specifically, the rearranged Ig genes encoding these 
specificities have been introduced into the Ig loci, such that 
all developing B cells express the autoreactive HIV-1 bnAb 
as a surface antigen receptor (Verkoczy et al., 2010, 2011a, 
2013; Doyle-Cooper et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2016). Results 
from these studies have shown that B cells with these HIV-1 
bnAb autoreactive specificities are predominantly censored 
by central tolerance in the bone marrow that ultimately pre-
cludes their further development. Recently, a small number 
of germline 2F5-expressing splenic B cells displaying an aner-
gic phenotype have been reported to mount a gp41-specific 
antibody response, although whether these antibodies were 
able to neutralize HIV-1 was not shown (Zhang et al., 2016). 
T
ogether, these studies have documented that central toler-
ance prevents the development of B cells expressing an au-
toreactive broadly neutralizing HIV-1 specificity. However, 
autoreactive B cells that have escaped central B cell toler-
ance also exist in the peripheral B cell pool of both humans 
and mice where they have been characterized to be func-
tionally anergic (Pugh-Bernard et al., 2001; Wardemann et 
al., 2003; Merrell et al., 2006; Koelsch et al., 2007). Whether 
peripheral tolerance normally limits the ability of these cells 
from mounting a protective HIV-1 antibody response has 
not yet been established.
We addressed this question with a different approach 
by initially asking if autoimmune prone strains of mice with 
known deficits in tolerance can mount HIV-1 Env-specific 
antibody responses that could be neutralizing. Our findings

(RSC3) epitope, as well as a CD4bs-negative 
control (ΔRSC3). The two neutralizing IgM

revealed that although both healthy wild-type and autoim-
mune-prone mice mount Env-specific antibody responses, 
only autoimmune mice produce HIV-1–neutralizing anti-
bodies. About half of Env immunized autoimmune prone, 
but not wild-type, mice generated serum antibodies able to 
neutralize tier 2 HIV-1 strains. Although B6.Sle123 mice 
mount normal primary Env-specific IgG antibody responses, 
Env was not required as an immunogen for HIV-1 neutral-
ization; adjuvant treatment alone was sufficient to elicit tier 2 
HIV-1–neutralizing antibodies. 
Thus, we conclude that in this 
autoimmune prone mouse strain, alum promotes autoreactive 
and Env-reactive B cells expressing neutralizing antibodies to 
differentiate into antibody-secreting cells.
A second autoimmune strain, MRL/lpr, also produced 
tier 2 HIV-1–neutralizing serum antibodies after alum treat-
ment and also, in contrast to B6.Sle123, as naive mice (un-
published data). We consider that this difference between 
autoimmune strains likely reflects the fact that naive MRL/
lpr mice harbor relatively high titers of autoreactive antibod-
ies in sera and develop lupus at significantly younger ages 
than B6.Sle123 mice. Regardless, together our findings fur-
ther demonstrate certain autoreactive specificities are able to 
neutralize HIV-1. Our findings using mouse models is also 
consistent with a recent study by Bonsignori et al. (2014) on 
an individual with SLE who was infected with HIV-1 before 
autoimmune diagnosis but controlled her viral load without 
antiretroviral therapy. 
The plasma from this individual also dis-
played multi-clade broadly neutralizing HIV-1 activity and 
an autoreactive (anti-dsDNA) Env-specific antibody (CH98) 
with similar breadth and potency was isolated from a mem-
ory B cell (Bonsignori et al., 2014). Thus, although impaired 
tolerance in both humans and mice has already been associ-
ated with the presence of Env-specific antibodies (Kion and 
Hoffman, 1991; Barthel and Wallace, 1993; Lombardi et al., 
1993; Mylonakis et al., 2000; Carugati et al., 2013), our re-
sults demonstrate that Env-specific antibodies produced as a 
consequence of a breach in tolerance have the potential to 
provide humoral protection against HIV-1.
It is interesting that a sizeable proportion of bnAbs with 
specificities to the conserved CD4-binding site on gp120 or 
MPER on gp41 also recognize self-antigens. Whether this 
reflects a mechanism evolved by HIV-1 to avoid adaptive im-
munity is not clear. However, endogenous retroviruses have 
comprised a sizable portion of the mammalian genome for 
millions of years and feasibly altered the evolution of our im-
mune system. 
Thus, some retroviral-encoded antigens may in-
deed be considered self by the vertebrate immune system and 
antibodies capable of recognizing these antigens may be re-
leased when tolerance is compromised and possibly accounting 
for the weak muLV neutralizing in both the genetically prone 
and experimentally induced autoimmune mouse models.
It was important to unequivocally demonstrate that 
serum antibody was responsible for the observed HIV-1 neu-
tralization in our assays, because the ability of serum antibody 
to neutralize HIV-1 has previously mistakenly been reported 
(LaCasse et al., 1999; Nunberg, 2002). Accordingly, we used 
independent approaches to document antibody-mediated 
HIV-1 neutralization that included showing that purified 
serum IgG and two IgM mAbs isolated from immunized 
B6.Sle123-derived hybridomas were able to neutralize tier 
2 HIV-1. Thus, although the tier 2 HIV-1–neutralizing titers 
from sera were relatively weak, this neutralizing activity was 
specific and generated using a suboptimal immunogen after 
one or two immunizations of B6.Sle123 and pristane-treated 
wild-type mice, respectively.
A major finding presented in this study demonstrates 
that pristane treatment of wild-type B6 mice followed by Env 
immunization elicits tier 2 HIV-1–neutralizing antibodies. 
Pristane has been characterized to compromise immunolog-
ical tolerance in wild-type mice leading to the production 
of autoantibodies against nuclear antigens beginning about 
1 mo after treatment with increasing titers accumulating 
thereafter (Satoh and Reeves, 1994; Satoh et al., 2000). As 
autoimmune prone mice treated with alum alone produced 
tier 2 HIV-1–neutralizing antibodies, we expected alum to 
also elicit HIV-1–neutralizing antibodies in pristane-treated 
B6 mice. Although this was the case, we additionally show 
that Env immunization furthered the breadth and potency 
of neutralizing activity. This indicates enhanced neutralizing 
activity results from an Env-driven antibody response in mice 
with impaired immunological tolerance. These data support 
proposals suggesting that a break in immunological tolerance 
before HIV-1 Env vaccination may be a first step to elicit-
ing bnAbs (Verkoczy et al., 2011b; Dosenovic et al., 2012; 
Zhang et al., 2016). Indeed, relaxing transitional B cell selec-
tion by administering B cell activating factor (BAFF) before 
Env immunization in wild-type mice also increased serum 
autoantibodies which correlated with the presence of tier 1 
HIV-1–neutralizing antibodies (Dosenovic et al., 2012). Our 
study extends these findings by formally demonstrating a 
pristane-induced break in peripheral tolerance promotes the 
production of tier 2 HIV-1–neutralizing antibodies. Further, 
we identify a novel histone H2A autoreactive specificity that 
is also able to neutralize tier 2 HIV-1 strains.
How alum elicits HIV-1–neutralizing antibodies in the 
B6.Sle123 autoimmune mouse strain is not clear. We note, 
however, that when used alone, alum is able to induce sev-
eral proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-5, and 
IL-6 (McKee et al., 2009). Further, alum and other adjuvants, 
including pristane can induce autoimmune-like features in 
healthy individuals (Vera-Lastra et al., 2013). We propose that 
alum and pristane treatment generate a proinflammatory set-
ting that promotes poly-/autoreactive B cells, which are nor-
mally restrained by tolerance mechanisms, to differentiate and 
secrete autoantibodies that are also able to neutralize HIV-1.
Not all autoimmune-prone mice produced HIV-1–
neutralizing antibodies (∼50% of B6.Sle123 and 60–80% of 
MRL/lpr). Among the parameters tested, the only signifi-
cant correlation with tier 2 HIV-1–neutralizing activity of 
B6.Sle123 mice were with elevated levels of serum IgM and 
 2295

titers of IgM anti-H2A histone protein. Importantly, pris-
tane-treated B6 mice also elicited tier 2 HIV-1–neutralizing 
antibody responses and harbored elevated titers of anti-H2A 
IgM compared with nonneutralizers. Thus, these data reveal 
a significant correlation between titers of IgM H2A-reactive 
autoantibodies and tier 2 HIV-1 neutralization. 
We confirmed 
this correlation by isolating histone H2A-reactive IgM mAbs 
that also recognize HIV-1 Env and the gp120 CD4 binding 
site and are able to neutralize tier 2 HIV-1. The exact epitope 
or posttranslational modification of histone H2A recognized 
by these mAbs has not yet been identified. Autoreactive spec-
ificities in other Env-specific antibodies have been shown to 
increase the apparent affinity of a bnAb for the virion by 
virtue of heteroligation, the recognition of both Env and a 
putative self-antigen (e.g., phospholipid) on the virion sur-
face (Mouquet et al., 2010). It is difficult to envision how 
an anti-H2A specificity may promote heteroligation in this 
manner. Alternatively and most likely, the histone H2A spec-
ificity may reflect an example of molecular mimicry where 
HIV-1 Env has evolved to mimic an epitope on histone H2A 
as a mechanism of immune camouflage implemented via 
immunological tolerance.
Mice are not a physiological host for HIV-1 and eliciting 
neutralizing activity for tier 1 HIV-1 has been a general chal-
lenge in mouse models. When achieved in wild-type mice, 
typically after multiple Env immunizations, neutralization 
has been limited in breadth to neutralization sensitive, lower 
tier HIV-1 strains (McCoy and Weiss, 2013; Hu et al., 2015). 
However, tier 2 HIV-1 strains are more similar to founder 
viruses that dominate new infections, which a successful vac-
cine would be expected to protect against (de Taeye et al., 
2016). Immunization of rabbits and macaques with more sta-
ble, native-like Env trimers (Sanders et al., 2002; Beddows et 
al., 2005; Burton and Hangartner, 2016; de Taeye et al., 2016) 
can elicit autologous tier 2 HIV-1–neutralizing antibodies (de 
Taeye et al., 2015, 2016; Sanders et al., 2015). However, im-
munization of wild-type mice with similar Env trimers have 
only elicited tier 1 HIV-1–neutralizing antibodies thus far 
(Hu et al., 2015). Considering these findings, our immuni-
zation of pristane-treated wild-type B6 mice twice with a 
(relatively unstable) Env trimer that elicits tier 2 HIV-1–neu-
tralizing antibodies is noteworthy.
The nature of the B cells in pristane-treated wild-type 
mice that give rise to tier 2 HIV-1–neutralizing activity re-
mains unclear. In humans, the anti-gp160 antibody response 
to HIV-1 has been shown to predominantly arise from 
poly-/autoreactive mature B cells (Mouquet et al., 2011; 
Mouquet and Nussenzweig, 2012). In mice, transitional, an-
ergic and marginal zone B cell subpopulations have all been 
characterized to express a poly-/autoreactive antibody reper-
toire (Chen et al., 1997; Carey et al., 2008), and we previously 
reported that marginal zone B cells from naive wild-type 
B6 mice often express a gp120-reactive antibody recep-
tor that also displays autoreactivity toward nuclear antigens 
(Pujanauski et al., 2013). Which of these B cell populations, 
if any, is responsible for tier 2 HIV-neutralizing activity and 
whether Env-elicited HIV-1–neutralizing B cells can develop 
into memory B cells remains to be determined but can be 
addressed with mouse models. Regardless, our study shows 
that immunological tolerance limits the ability of these auto-
reactive precursor B cells to produce Env-specific antibodies 
capable of neutralizing tier 2 HIV-1 strains.

HIV-1 Envelope protein production and purification
HIV-1 Envelope proteins were made and purified as de-
scribed previously (Pujanauski et al., 2013). Monomeric 
gp120 (ADA) and trimeric gp140 (YU2) were produced by 
transient transfection of COS7 cells (ATCC) with 5 µg of 
gp120 or gp140 plasmid (provided by T.M. Ross, Univer-
sity of Georgia, Athens, GA) and Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). 
gp120 and gp140 were purified as before (Pujanauski et al., 
2013), using a column made with agarose-bound lectin (Vec-
tor Laboratories). HIV-1 Envelope protein, bound to the 
column, was washed using PBS, and eluted with 1M methyl 
mannopyranoside (Sigma-Aldrich). The eluted protein was 
buffer exchanged and concentrated into sterile PBS using 
15 ml capacity centrifugal 30-kD cutoff filters (Ambicon). 
Protein purity was checked by Western blot with murine an-
ti-gp120 antibody (ImmunoDx) and SDS-PAGE.
Immunizations and sera collection
Mice were immunized i.p. with 50 µg of either monomeric 
gp120 or trimeric gp140 using Alu-Gel-S (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) as an alum adjuvant (Bower et al., 2004, 2005). Dose 
solutions were prepared by diluting HIV-1 Envelope proteins 
into PBS at the proper concentration and an equal volume of 
Alu-Gel-S was added. For alum-only injections, 
Alu-Gel-S was 
mixed 1:1 with sterile PBS. Immunogens were made at least 
4 h before dosing, and were incubated at 4°C while rotating to 
achieve an even suspension. For pristane treatment, 500 µl of 
pristane (2,6,10,14-T
etramethylpentadecane; Sigma-Aldrich) 
was injected i.p. Blood was collected from mice by tail vein 
bleeds before immunization and by cardiac puncture at time of 
sacrifice 14 d after immunization, unless otherwise noted. Sera 
was prepared by collecting blood in 1.1-ml serum microtubes 
containing Z gel (Sarstedt) and incubating for 45 min at room

by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 4 min at room temperature,

were coated with 2 µg/ml of gp120 (ADA) or gp140 (YU2) 
in PBS overnight at 4°C. Plates were washed three times with 
0.1% T
ween-20/PBS, blocked for 2 h at room temperature 
with 1% BSA in PBS, and washed again. T
o capture Enve-
lope-reactive antibodies, mouse sera samples were diluted 
starting at 1:10 in PBS, and subsequently serially diluted 
threefold for a total of eight dilutions per sample. 50 µl of 
mouse serum dilutions were added to coated ELI 
SA plates 
and incubated for at least 2 h at room temperature or over-
night at 4°C. Plates were washed three times and incubated 
with alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated goat anti–mouse 
isotype-specific (IgM, IgG, IgG1, IgG2b, IgG2c, IgG2a, or 
IgG3) detection antibody (Southern Biotech) diluted 1:2,000 
in blocking buffer for 1 h at 37°C. Plates were washed and 
color was developed by adding 1 mg/ml of 4-nitrophenyl 
phosphate disodium salt hexahydrate (Alkaline Phosphatase 
Substrate; Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in developing buffer (1M 
diethanolamine, 8.4 mM MgCl2, and 0.02% NaN3, pH 9.8). 
Absorbance values were read at 405 nm on 
VersaMax ELI 
SA 
reader (MDS Analytical T
echnologies). Titers were calculated 
from the serial dilutions by calculating the reciprocal serum 
dilution that gives half of the maximal OD405 response. 
Titer 
calculations were performed using GraphPad Prism software 
(v5) by first log transforming the reciprocal dilutions values 
followed by calculating EC50 values using the sigmoidal dose 
response with variable slope equation. Samples that did not 
reach the maximal OD405 response at any dilution, compared 
with the positive control, were set below the limit of detection.
Total IgM and IgG concentrations in mouse sera were 
quantitated using a sandwich ELI 
SA as described previously 
(Swanson et al., 2010). 96-well plates were coated with either 
goat anti–mouse IgM or goat anti–mouse Ig(H+L) (South-
ern Biotech) diluted at 1/100 in PBS. Plates were blocked, 
washed, and developed as for the HIV-1 Envelope ELI 
SAs. 
To capture total Ig, mouse sera samples were diluted starting 
at 1:1500 in PBS, and subsequently serially diluted threefold 
for a total of eight dilutions per sample. Standard curves con-
taining known concentrations of mouse IgM or IgG (South-
ern Biotech) were added to each plate and a four parameter 
equation was fitted using VersaMax software. T
otal serum Ig 
concentrations were quantitated from the standard curve 
equations using OD405 values in the linear absorbance range.
ElI 
sA for autoantigen reactive Ig in sera
Chromatin and Smith Ig ELI 
SAs were performed as previ-
ously reported (Fournier et al., 2012; Larson et al., 2012). 
In brief, to detect chromatin-reactive Ig, plates were coated 
with 10–15 µg/ml of calf thymus chromatin in PBS, 1 mM 
EDTA, 0.05% NaN3 buffer, overnight at 4°C. Chromatin was 
either a gift from L. Wysocki (National Jewish Health, Den-
ver, CO) and John Cambier (University of Colorado Denver, 
Aurora, CO). After coating, plates were washed once with 
0.5% T
ween 20/PBS, blocked for 2 h at 37°C with 1% BSA, 
1 mM EDTA, 0.05% NaN3 in PBS, and washed three times 
with 0.5% T
ween 20/PBS. T
o capture chromatin-reactive an-
tibodies, mouse sera samples were diluted starting at 1:30 in 
blocking buffer, and subsequently serially diluted threefold 
for a total of eight dilutions per sample. 50 µl of mouse serum 
dilutions were added to coated ELI 
SA plates and incubated 
for at least 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C. 
Plates were washed three times and incubated with alkaline 
phosphatase (AP)-conjugated goat anti–mouse isotype-spe-
cific (IgM or IgG) detection antibody (Southern Biotech) 
diluted 1:1,000 in blocking buffer for 1 h at 37°C.
For Histone H2A- and H2B-reactive IgM ELI 
SAs, 
plates were coated with 1 µg/ml of human recombinant his-
tone H2A or H2B (New England Biolabs) in PBS pH 7.4. 
Plates were washed, blocked with 1% BSA in PBS, developed, 
and serum samples diluted, as described for chromatin-reac-
tive Ig ELI 
SAs. For Smith antigen-reactive Ig ELI 
SAs, plates 
were coated with 1 µg/ml of Smith antigen (Meridian Life 
Sciences) diluted in 0.05M carbonate buffer, pH 9.5, over-
night at 4°C. Plates were washed, blocked, and developed, 
and serum samples diluted, as described for chromatin-reac-
tive Ig ELI 
SAs. For cardiolipin-reactive Ig ELI 
SAs, 50 µg/
ml of cardiolipin sodium salt (Sigma-Aldrich) was diluted 
in 100% molecular grade ethanol (Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific) and allowed to evaporate completely overnight at 4°C 
(Dosenovic et al., 2012). Blocking buffer (1% BSA/PBS) was 
added the next day after coating. Plates were washed, blocked, 
and developed, as described for HIV-1 Envelope-reactive 
ELI 
SAs. All serum samples for autoantigen ELI 
SAs were di-
luted, starting at 1:30 and subsequently serially diluted three-
fold for 8 total dilutions.
Autoantigen ELI 
SAs were read at OD405 nm and titers 
calculated as described for HIV-1 Envelope-reactive Ig ELI 
SAs. All titers were normalized to a positive control serum 
sample added to each plate to attain a relative titer. In this case, 
the positive control sera was pooled from old (>16 wk) lupus 
prone MRL/lpr and B6.Sle123 mice. Each positive control 
aliquot had previously been tested for chromatin, Smith, and 
cardiolipin-reactive IgM and IgG, and the appropriate ali-
quot used for each ELI 
SA.
Autoantigen protein array
Sera samples from six B6.Sle123 neutralizers, six B6.Sle123 
nonneutralizers, and three B6 nonneutralizers were sent to 
UT Southwestern for IgM and IgG binding analysis on the 
95 autoantigen protein array panel II. Samples were prepared 
and data analyzed by the UT Southwestern Microarray core 
as described previously (Li et al., 2006; Chong et al., 2012). 
 2297
JEM Vol. 214, No. 8
In brief, serum samples are treated with DNase I before incu-
bation on the 95 autoantigen array chip, and mouse IgM and 
IgG were detected with fluorescent antibodies. Array chips 
are read using GenePix 4400A Microarray scanner, and data 
were analyzed by GenePix 7.0 software. Fluorescent intensi-
ties for each autoantigen are averaged, normalized to internal 
controls, and data are reported as both normalized signal in-
tensity and the signal to noise ratio (SNR).
tZMbl neutralization assays
Neutralization assays using 
TZMbl cells with mouse sera were 
performed as described previously (Sarzotti-Kelsoe et al., 
2014) and as per the Montefiori website (Duke University). 
TZMbl cells were received through the National Institutes of 
Health AIDS Reagent Program (Division of AIDS, NIA 
ID), 
and all assays were performed in BSL2+ and BSL3 facilities, 
in accordance with UCD Biosafety protocols. Before assaying 
mouse sera collected from immunized and control B6.Sle123, 
MRL/lpr, and B6 mice, sera were heat inactivated at 55°C for 
45 min. Sera were vortexed and centrifuged immediately be-
fore diluting for the neutralization assay. Mouse sera samples 
were run in duplicate for each viral assay using white opaque, 
96-well CulturPlates (Perkin Elmer). Heat-inactivated mouse 
sera was diluted starting at 1:15 in DMEM, followed by 1:3 
serial dilutions for a total of eight dilutions in 100 µl total 
volume. In cases where purified monoclonal antibodies were 
tested, purified antibody samples were diluted to a starting 
concentration of 50 µg/ml, and serially diluted 1:3 down the 
plate for a total of eight dilutions in 100 µl total volume. 
HIV-1 strains were diluted at the predetermined viral titer 
(see HIV-1 production and titration section) in DMEM. 50 µl 
of diluted virus was added to each well containing mouse sera 
dilutions and allowed to incubate for 2 h at 37°C, 5% CO2. 
Given the 1:2 dilution adding virus, the final starting dilu-
tion of mouse sera was 1:30. TZMbl cells were trypsinized, 
washed, and 10,000 cells/100 µl in complete DMEM + 10% 
FBS were added to each well. Each plate was run with one 
column (8 wells) of cell only control wells (150 µl media + 
100 µl cells) and one column of virus controls (100 µl DMEM 
+ 50 µl diluted virus + 100 µl cells). Cells were incubated for 
2 d at 37°C, 5% CO2. After incubation, 100 µl of superna-
tant was removed, replaced with 100 µl luciferase substrate 
(Britelite plus Reporter Gene Assay system; Perkin Elmer), 
and pipetted up and down to lyse cells. Plates were read on a 
Victor X light luminescence plate reader (Perkin Elmer) after 
2 min after cell lysis, but within 15 min.
Serum neutralization titers are expressed as inhibitory 
dose 50 (ID50), the reciprocal of the serum dilution that pro-
duces 50% virus neutralization, as compared with the virus 
controls. Percent neutralization was calculated using the lu-
minescence Excel macro, provided by D. Montefoiri online 
and modified by P
. Gao (Duke University, Durham, NC). 
The 
equation used to calculate percent neutralization is (average 
RLU virus control − RLU sample well)/(average RLU virus 
control − average RLU cell control) × 100. Percent neu-
tralization data were used when the RLU values for virus 
only controls were >10-fold above background, and the stan-
dard deviation was within 30% for the cell only and virus 
only controls, as well as between sample duplicates. Each day 
a neutralization assay was run, a positive control antibody, 
VRC01, was run in duplicate to validate the assay. VRC01 
was diluted starting at 2 µg/ml and serially diluted 1:3 for 
a total of 8 dilutions. The IC50 was calculated as the anti-
body concentration needed to give 50% neutralization. The 
IC50 obtained for each virus strain was in good agreement 
with previously published IC50 values (Wu et al., 2010), and 
consistent across neutralization assays run on different days 
(standard deviation ±30%).
Neutralizing antibody titers against Friend muLV was 
performed as previously described (Santiago et al., 2008) by 
co-incubating serial dilutions of mouse sera with 50 infec-
tious units of Friend muLV before infection of Mus dunni 
cells. Sera from Friend muLV-infected mice were used as a 
positive control. IC50 values were computed based on a one-
site sigmoidal fit (GraphPad Prism).
HIV-1 production and viral titration
Pseudo-viruses (SF162.LS, JR-FL, and BaL.26) were pro-
duced by transient co-transfection of 5 µg/ml of gp160 en-
coding plasmid and 10 µg/ml of SG3Δenv plasmid in 293T 
cells. The SG3Δenv, BaL.26, and SF162.LS plasmids were 
all obtained through the National Institutes of Health AIDS 
Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIA 
ID, NIH (Cheng-
Mayer et al., 1997; Stamatatos et al., 2000; Wei et al., 2002, 
2003; Li et al., 2006). The JR-FL plasmid was a gift from P
. 
Clapham at the University of Massachusetts (Gonzalez-Perez 
et al., 2012). 
YU2 full-length virus (Gene Bank M93258) was 
also produced by transient transfection of 293T cells using 20 
µg/ml of plasmid. The YU2 plasmid was obtained through 
the NIH AIDS Reagent Program (Li et al., 1991, 1992).
Transfections were done with 293T cells, growing 
at 50–70% confluency, in T75 flasks. DNA was diluted 
in 0.13 M CaCl2 containing HBS buffer (Hepes buffered 
saline), pH 7.0, and incubated at room temperature for 30 
min to allow DNA aggregates to form. DNA was added 
to cells, with fresh media (complete DMEM + 10% FBS). 
Cells were incubated at 5% CO2 at 37°C, media was re-
placed 16 h later, and viral supernatants collected 24 h later. 
Viral supernatants were filtered through 0.2 µm syringes, 
aliquoted, and stored at −80°C. Each virus was titrated 
before use, as previously reported (Sarzotti-Kelsoe et al., 
2014). In brief, viral supernatants were thawed, diluted 
starting at 1:3 in DMEM, and serially diluted 1:3 for a total 
of 8 dilutions, and 100 µl total volume in white opaque, 
96-well CulturPlates (Perkin Elmer). TZMbl cells were 
infected by adding 10,000 cells to each well in 100 µl of 
complete DMEM + 10% FBS. 2 d later, cells were lysed, 
luciferase substrate added, and read as for the TZMbl assay 
described in the preceding section. Data are given by the 
instrument in relative light units (RLUs) and plotted against

reciprocal dilutions to calculate the dilution of virus needed 
to produce a mean of 150,000 RLUs in lysed 
TZMbl cells. 
This was the viral dilution (titer) used to infect cells in the 
TZMbl neutralization assays.
Vrc01 production and purification
VRC01 was produced by transiently co-transfecting 293F 
cells (Invitrogen) using 250 µg of heavy and 250 µg of light 
chain plasmids and 293Fectin reagent (Invitrogen). The 
VRC01 heavy and light chain plasmids (CMVR VRC01 H 
+ L) were obtained through the AIDS Research and Ref-
erence Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIA 
ID, NIH 
(Wu et al., 2010). Cell supernatants were collected after 5 d 
by centrifugation and filtered through a 0.22-µm filter (Nal-
gene). 
VRC01 was purified over a protein G column, buffer 
exchanged into PBS, and stored at −20°C. VRC01 was val-
idated using ELI 
SA and found to bind the CD4bs (RSC3), 
with minimal binding to null CD4bs (ΔRSC3), as reported 
(Wu et al., 2010). RSC3 and ΔRSC3 were obtained from the 
NIH AIDS Reagent Program.
Generation of B cell hybridomas and purification 
of monoclonal antibodies
B cell hybridomas were generated from B6.Sle123 mice im-
munized with Env + alum and that displayed serum neu-
tralization of tier 2 HIV-1 strains, as previously described 
(Fournier et al., 2012; Pujanauski et al., 2013). Cell superna-
tants from hybridomas were screened at least twice for histone 
H2A-reactivity 7 d after selection. Monoclonal antibodies 
were considered histone H2A-reactive if they had an OD405 
> 1.0 after successive screening using two different blocking 
proteins: bovine serum albumin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) 
and fish skin gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich). For negative Ig con-
trols, hybridoma supernatants that tested negative for histone 
H2A were selected at random. Hybridomas were cultured in 
complete RPMI 1640 medium with 15% FBS, depleted of 
bovine IgG by passage over a protein G column, until IgM 
and IgG levels were in sufficient concentrations in super-
natants for purification.
IgG monoclonal antibodies were purified from hybrid-
oma supernatants using a protein G column. IgM monoclo-
nal antibodies were purified with affinity chromatagraphy 
using an anti–mouse IgM mAb (rat IgG2a; clone R33-
24.12) covalently coupled to Sepharose beads. Both IgM 
and IgG monoclonal antibodies were eluted from columns 
using 0.1M glycine-HCl, pH 2.8, and pH neutralized using 
1M 
Tris-HCl, pH 9.0. Purified antibodies were concentrated 
and buffer exchanged into PBS, pH 7.4 at least three times 
using 15 ml capacity centricons with 30 kD filter cutoff
 
(Ambicon). Mouse IgM and IgG concentrations were quan-
tified using sandwich ELI 
SA, as described in Materials and 
methods. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated no contamination 
of the monoclonal IgM antibodies with the rat monoclonal 
IgG antibody coupled to Sepharose. Concentrations were 
adjusted to 50 µg/ml for testing using the TZMbl assay for 
HIV-1 neutralization and using ELI 
SA for antibody spec-
ificities, as described.
Purification of IgG from sera using protein G beads
To purify IgG from the sera of B6.Sle123 and B6 mice, we 
used a previously described protocol for depletion of IgG 
from sera (Melchers et al., 2012). In brief, 120 µl of sera + 
200 µl of 50% (vol/vol) of protein G agarose beads (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific) + 680 µl PBS (pH 7.4) were incubated 
overnight at 4°C while rotating. The next day, samples were 
centrifuged at 5,000 g for 2.5 min, and supernatant was col-
lected into another microcentrifuge tube, and repeated if 
necessary until no beads were left. Protein G beads were 
washed with 500 µl of 1X RIPA/Tween-20 buffer (50 mM 
Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 1%NP-40, 0.25% so-
dium deoxycholate, 0.05% Tween-20, protease inhibitors) at 
least five times. After each wash, samples were centrifuged 
at 5,000 g for 2.5 min. IgG was eluted from the beads by 
adding 1,100 µl of IgG elution buffer (0.1M glycine-HCl, 
pH 2.8), and tubes were inverted to mix. To neutralize the 
elution buffer and bring the pH back to 7.0, 100 µl of 1M 
Tris-HCl pH 9.5 was added. Samples were centrifuged at 
5,000 g for 2.5 min to remove beads. The supernatants were 
collected, concentrated, and buffer exchanged at least 10 
times into PBS (pH 7.4). IgG concentrations were measured 
and quantitated by sandwich ELI 
SA, as described above, and 
the purified IgG was shown to be pure using SDS-PAGE. 
Purified IgG samples were tested for neutralization by the 
TZMbl assay, described above, with a starting concentration 
of 100 µg/ml, and serially diluted threefold for a total of 8 
dilutions in 100 µl total volume. The IC50, defined as the 
concentration of antibody required for 50% neutralization, 
was calculated using the TZMbl neutralization Excel macro 
and reported for the purified antibody samples.
statistics and data analysis
Statistics were calculated using GraphPad Prism software 
(v5). Statistical significance was analyzed using a two-tailed 
Student’s t test assuming unequal variances or Mann-Whit-
ney test when the variances were not a Gaussian distribu-
tion. Neutralization data between immunization groups and 
controls was analyzed using Fisher’s Exact T
est. P ≤ 0.05 was 
considered significant and denoted as *, P < 0.05; **, P < 
0.001; and ***, P < 0.0001. If no statistics are reported, data 
are not statistical significant (P > 0.06). Data were graphed as 
the geometric mean ± SEM.
