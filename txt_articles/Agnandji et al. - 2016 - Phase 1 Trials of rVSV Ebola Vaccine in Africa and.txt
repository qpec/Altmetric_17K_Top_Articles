A full list of authors and affiliations appears at the end of the article.
Abstract
Background—The replication-competent recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)–based 
vaccine expressing a Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) glycoprotein was selected for rapid safety and 
immunogenicity testing before its use in West Africa.
Methods—We performed three open-label, dose-escalation phase 1 trials and one randomized, 
double-blind, controlled phase 1 trial to assess the safety, side-effect profile, and immunogenicity 
of rVSV-ZEBOV at various doses in 158 healthy adults in Europe and Africa. All participants 
were injected with doses of vaccine ranging from 300,000 to 50 million plaque-forming units 
(PFU) or placebo.
Results—No serious vaccine-related adverse events were reported. Mild-to-moderate early-onset 
reactogenicity was frequent but transient (median, 1 day). Fever was observed in up to 30% of

 vaccinees. Vaccine viremia was detected within 3 days in 123 of the 130 participants (95%) 
receiving 3 million PFU or more; rVSV was not detected in saliva or urine. In the second week 
after injection, arthritis affecting one to four joints developed in 11 of 51 participants (22%) in 
Geneva, with pain lasting a median of 8 days (interquartile range, 4 to 87); 2 self-limited cases 
occurred in 60 participants (3%) in Hamburg, Germany, and Kilifi, Kenya. The virus was 
identified in one synovial-fluid aspirate and in skin vesicles of 2 other vaccinees, showing 
peripheral viral replication in the second week after immunization. ZEBOV-glycoprotein–specific 
antibody responses were detected in all the participants, with similar glycoprotein-binding 
antibody titers but significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers at higher doses. Glycoprotein-
binding antibody titers were sustained through 180 days in all participants.
Conclusions—In these studies, rVSV-ZEBOV was reactogenic but immunogenic after a single 
dose and warrants further evaluation for safety and efficacy. (Funded by the Wellcome Trust and 
others; ClinicalTrials.gov numbers, NCT02283099, NCT02287480, and NCT02296983; Pan 
African Clinical Trials Registry number, PACTR201411000919191.)
In August 2014, after the outbreak of Ebola virus disease was declared a public health 
emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Canadian 
government donated 800 vials of the replication-competent recombinant vesicular stomatitis 
virus (rVSV)–vectored Zaire ebolavirus (rVSV-ZEBOV) candidate vaccine to the WHO. 
The VSV Ebola Consortium (VEBCON) was created under the auspices of the WHO to 
initiate phase 1 studies to facilitate rapid progression to phase 2 and 3 trials in affected 
countries.1
Live replicating viral vaccines elicit humoral and cellular immune responses against viral 
pathogens.2,3 A single injection of 10 million plaque-forming units (PFU) of rVSV-ZEBOV 
protected nonhuman primates exposed to lethal doses of ZEBOV.4–7 Vesicular stomatitis 
virus belongs to the Rhabdoviridae family.8 In livestock, wild-type VSV causes vesicles and 
ulcerations of the oral tissues, feet, and teats.9 Human infections are rare and asymptomatic 
or typically cause mild influenza-like illness, although more severe infections have been 
described.9–14 The wild-type virus is not endemic in Africa and Europe.15,16 The 
preclinical safety record of the rVSV vector is encouraging: among approximately 80 
immunized nonhuman primates, none had detectable toxic effects.3 Viremia associated with 
rVSV-ZEBOV was detected on day 2 only, suggesting rapid viral clearance through the 
innate immune response. Safety in immunocompromised hosts was assessed in a few 
nonhuman primates infected with the human immunodeficiency virus6 and in mice with 
severe combined immunodeficiency.17 None of the animals had detectable illness after 
immunization. Viral shedding in saliva and urine was not observed.3
To assess the safety and immunogenicity of various doses of rVSV-ZEBOV in countries 
with or without previous outbreaks of Ebola virus disease, we initiated parallel, harmonized 
VEBCON trials in Lambaréné, Gabon; Kilifi, Kenya; Hamburg, Germany; and Geneva, 
Switzerland. We report the 6-month safety and immunogenicity data from these ongoing 
studies.

 Methods
Study Designs and Participants
The studies in Lambaréné, Kilifi, and Hamburg were open-label, uncontrolled, phase 1 trials 
designed to assess the safety, side-effect profiles, and immunogenicity of ascending doses of 
rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine (BPSC1001) at doses ranging from 300,000 to 20 million PFU in 
healthy adults of both sexes between the ages of 18 and 55 years. The Geneva study was a 
double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 1 trial assessing the safety and 
immunogenicity of the rVSV–ZEBOV vaccine at doses of 10 million and 50 million PFU in 
healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 65 years. Full details regarding the study centers, 
entry criteria, and procedures are provided in the study protocol, available with the full text 
of this article at NEJM.org. The studies were reviewed and approved by the respective 
national competent authorities, local ethics committees, the German authority for genetic 
engineering, and the WHO research ethics review committee. All the participants provided 
written informed consent. An independent consortium-wide data and safety monitoring 
board provided oversight.
All four studies were investigator-initiated trials sponsored by each local institution. The 
Wellcome Trust provided funding through a grant to the WHO. A total of 800 vaccine doses 
were donated to the WHO by the Public Health Agency of Canada. Funding bodies and the 
vaccine manufacturers were not involved in the analysis of the data, nor did they contribute 
to the preparation or writing of the manuscript.
Vaccine and Placebo
The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine was developed by the Canadian National Microbiology 
Laboratory and was licensed to BioProtection Systems (a subsidiary of NewLink Genetics). 
The vaccine was subsequently sublicensed to Merck, which has assumed responsibility for 
ongoing research and development. The vaccine was manufactured at IDT Biologika in 
Dessau-Rosslau, Germany, and stored in a manner consistent with good manufacturing 
practices. The same lot (no. 003 05 13), which was dispensed in single-dose vials as 100 
million PFU per milliliter, was sent from Canada to Geneva and subsequently to the other 
sites. (Additional details regarding reconstitution are provided in the Supplementary 
Appendix.) Placebo syringes containing 0.5 ml of saline were packaged identically.
Vaccination
Injections were administered intramuscularly into the deltoid. Dose-escalation studies were 
staggered (for details, see the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix). In the 
Lambaréné cohort, participants received doses of 300,000 or 3 million PFU. In Hamburg, 
participants received doses of 3 million or 20 million PFU. In Kilifi, participants received 
doses of 3 million or 20 million PFU. In Geneva, the first 19 run-in participants received a 
single open-label injection of 10 million PFU and were observed for at least 1 week. 
Thereafter, participants who were planning to deploy to Ebola-affected regions were 
randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio in a double-blind fashion to receive a vaccine dose of either 
10 million or 50 million PFU, whereas those who were not planning to deploy to such 
regions were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either one of the vaccine doses or

 placebo. (An overview of the four trials is provided in Fig. S4 in the Supplementary 
Appendix.)
Safety Monitoring
Injection-site and systemic reactogenicity and medication use were recorded for 7 days after 
injection and at follow-up (days 14 and 28). Clinical and laboratory evaluations were 
performed during each study visit (for details, see the Methods section in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Laboratory analyses included a complete blood count and measurements of 
creatinine, C-reactive protein, and liver function. Adverse events were listed for each 
participant according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events and the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities and are reported individually and in aggregate.
Investigation of Arthritis and Skin Lesions
After the observation of arthralgia in some Geneva participants, all but the first participant 
with swollen joints or axial involvement in Geneva underwent joint imaging by means of 
ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and all but two participants were 
referred to a rheumatologist. Arthritis was confirmed if the study team observed swelling or 
imaging revealed effusion. Participants in Geneva who had skin lesions underwent biopsy, 
swabbing, or puncture of lesions.
Detection of rVSV
We developed quantitative reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) 
assays (TaqMan) targeting the VSV nucleoprotein gene (see the Methods section in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Results are expressed in copies per milliliter. In the dose-
escalation trials, rVSV viral loads were monitored from day 0 to day 28 and included daily 
sampling of plasma, urine, and saliva through day 7 in Hamburg. In Lambaréné and Kilifi, 
total RNA from plasma, urine (400 μl), and saliva (200 μl) (Viral Transport Kit, BD) was 
stored in TRIzol LS Reagent (Life Technologies) and analyzed at St. George’s University of 
London. In Hamburg, samples were assessed on site. In Geneva, RT-PCR was performed on 
days 1, 3, and 7 on all plasma specimens, on saliva and urine in the first 20 participants 
vaccinated with 10 million PFU and 10 participants vaccinated with 50 million PFU, and 
later on skin vesicles and synovial fluid. RT-PCR assay to detect rVSV was performed on 
oral lesions observed in Hamburg and Geneva. Virus isolation was performed in Geneva by 
means of plaque assay on Vero E6 cells from selected samples and confirmed on PCR and 
immunostaining (see the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix).
Immunogenicity
We assessed serum samples at baseline and at 28 and 180 days after injection. We performed 
the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for ZEBOV-glycoprotein–specific 
antibodies using the homologous Zaire–Kikwit strain glycoprotein (following the standard 
operating procedure of the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases 
[SOP AP-03-35-00]) or inactivated whole virions of the Zaire–Guéckédou strain. The 
relative amounts of ZEBOV-glycoprotein–specific antibodies were reported as endpoint 
titers or as geometric mean concentrations of arbitrary ELISA units per milliliter.

 Neutralizing antibodies were detected with the use of VSV pseudovirions expressing the 
luciferase reporter gene complemented by glycoprotein from the ZEBOV 95 Kikwit strain, 
as described previously,18 or infectious ZEBOV isolate Mayinga. (For detailed descriptions, 
see the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix.)
Statistical Analysis
We determined the frequencies of all adverse events according to study center and dose 
group. Categorical variables are described with counts and percentages, and continuous 
variables with means and standard deviations or medians and interquartile ranges for skewed 
variables. Antibody responses are reported as the geometric mean titer or geometric mean 
concentration with 95% confidence intervals. We obtained reverse cumulative distributions 
by plotting for each possible value of the titer the proportion of participants with a titer 
greater than this value. We used Fisher’s exact test, the Mann–Whitney test, and the 
Kruskal–Wallis test or Spearman’s correlation coefficient to calculate intergroup 
associations. We compared geometric mean titers or concentrations, seropositivity rates, and 
seroresponse rates between days 0 and 28 using Wilcoxon’s test for paired data and 
McNemar’s test. Antibody persistence and correlation among assays were assessed by 
comparing geometric mean titers or concentrations at 28 days with those at 180 days with 
the use of Wilcoxon’s test for paired data and Spearman’s correlation coefficient, 
respectively.
The blinding was broken after the 3-month visit for all Geneva participants. For the Geneva 
trial, immunogenicity analyses were conducted according to both intention-to-treat and per-
protocol principles. In the intention-to-treat analyses, all participants who received an 
injection were included; per-protocol analyses excluded participants who might have been 
exposed to Ebola virus or who had received an unplanned additional vaccine dose after the 
initial administration of vaccine. In the absence of significant differences (see the 
Supplementary Appendix), results of the intention-to-treat analysis are reported. All 
statistical testing was two-sided with an alpha level of 0.05. The statistical analysis plans are 
provided in the study protocol at NEJM.org.
Results
Study Populations
A total of 158 participants received either vaccine (150 participants) or placebo (8 
participants) in the three dose-escalation studies from November 17, 2014, through January 
19, 2015, and in the Geneva randomized, controlled trial from November 10, 2014, through 
December 9, 2014, before a safety-driven study hold and subsequent resumption of 
vaccination with a lower dose (3 million PFU) (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
The study populations are described in Table 1, and in Table S2 in the Supplementary 
Appendix. In Geneva, the run-in participants and those who underwent randomization were 
compared for baseline characteristics and adverse-event outcomes. In the absence of 
significant differences, pooled results are reported. Vaccine was administered in doses as 
follows: 300,000 PFU in 20 participants, 3 million PFU in 49 participants, 10 million PFUs 
in 35 participants, 20 million PFU in 30 participants, and 50 million PFU in 16 participants.

 All but 3 participants were followed for at least 6 months (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
Nine participants in Geneva were excluded from the 6-month per-protocol analyses: eight 
had been deployed to Ebola-affected countries and reported potential exposure to Ebola 
virus, and one had received an extra-study booster dose at 3 months while in Guinea. The 
results reported here are from interim databases for ongoing trials.
Safety
Serious Adverse Events—There were no serious adverse events associated with the 
vaccine. Seven hospitalizations occurred in Lambaréné for malaria (4 patients), appendicitis 
(1 patient), gastritis (1 patient), and bleeding after tooth extraction (1 patient).
Acute Reactogenicity—Solicited and unsolicited adverse events were frequent. Of the 
158 participants, 145 (92%) had at least one adverse event, with the majority of events 
reported as mild or moderate. Grade 3 symptoms were reported in 4 of 40 participants (10%) 
in Kilifi, 2 of 20 (10%) in Hamburg, and 11 of 51 (22%) in Geneva; none were reported in 
Lambaréné. Local reactogenicity was common but generally mild. Most adverse events 
appeared early (median, 1 day; interquartile range, <24 hours to 1 day), subsided rapidly 
(median, 1 day; interquartile range, <24 hours to 1 day), and were alleviated with the use of 
acetaminophen or nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs as needed. The incidence and 
intensity of the events varied according to both the dose and the study site: objective fever 
was reported in 5 of 20 participants (25%) in Hamburg, 13 of 51 (25%) in Geneva, 12 of 40 
(30%) in Kilifi, and 5 of 39 (13%) in Lambaréné. At a given dose, such as 3 million PFU, 
inflammatory reactions were more frequently reported in hospitalized participants in 
Hamburg than in Lambaréné. A detailed list of adverse events is provided in Table S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix.
Biologic Monitoring—Hematologic changes were observed in all participants who were 
monitored during the first days after vaccination (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
In Lambaréné, transient leukocytopenia was observed in 12 of 20 participants (60%) 
receiving 300,000 PFU and in 8 of 19 participants (42%) receiving 3 million PFU; 
lymphocytopenia was observed in 2 of 19 participants (11%) in the group receiving 3 
million PFU.
In Hamburg, an asymptomatic decrease in the number of circulating lymphocytes was 
observed 1 day after vaccination in all participants and resolved by day 2 (P<0.01 for all 
comparisons between screening and day 1). The decrease was unrelated to dose, 
reactogenicity, or substantial viremia, indicating biologic activity even at a dose of 3 million 
PFU. Among the 51 participants in Geneva, 36 (71%) had a decreased number of circulating 
lymphocytes on day 1, and 27 (53%) had a decreased number of neutrophils on day 3, with 
rapid resolution of both conditions (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). Monocytosis 
on day 3 and a transient reduction in platelets were also observed. Liver-function and 
creatinine levels remained unchanged.

 Viremia and Viral Shedding—Low levels of rVSV-ZEBOV RNA were identified in 
plasma on RT-PCR assay on days 1 to 3 in most participants who were tested (Fig. 1, and 
Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). Participants with positive results for rVSV on 
PCR assay ranged from 8 of 20 (40%) among Lambaréné vaccinees immunized with 
300,000 PFU to 46 of 51 (90%) among Geneva vaccinees. In Lambaréné, 18 of 19 
participants (95%) who received a dose of 3 million PFU had detectable viremia on day 1 or 
2; 15 of 19 participants (79%) had complete resolution by day 7. The same pattern was 
observed in Kilifi, where 35 of 40 participants (88%) had values that were below the 
detection level by day 7. In Hamburg, all participants who received doses of 3 million and 
20 million PFU who were monitored daily until day 7 had detectable viremia, with peaks on 
day 2 or 3 and complete resolution by day 5.
All but 11 plasma specimens from all studies were negative by day 7, and infectious virus 
was not recovered from any blood specimen tested. In the Geneva study, there was no 
correlation between peak viremia and vaccine dose, age, sex, frequency or intensity of 
adverse events, or lymphocytopenia. Viral RNA was not detected in saliva or urine samples 
at any site; occasional oral lesions were all negative for rVSV on PCR assay.
Arthritis—In Geneva, 11 of 51 participants (22%) with no previous history of joint disease 
had an onset of arthralgia a median of 11 days (interquartile range, 9 to 13) after injection; 8 
participants had received 10 million PFU and 3 had received 50 million PFU. These 
participants presented with asymmetric involvement of a median of 2 (range, 1 to 4) 
peripheral joints, with swelling on physical examination and, as seen on ultrasonography, 
tenosynovitis or bursitis in at least 1 joint (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). Three 
participants had axial involvement; of these, 1 had evidence of arthritis on MRI. Thus, 
arthritis was confirmed in 9 of 11 participants. Pain was often migratory and generally mild. 
Among participants in whom pain was prolonged, the median duration was 8 days 
(interquartile range, 4 to 87), and pain generally became less intense and more intermittent 
after the first week. The functional effect of the arthritis was moderate, with a median score 
of 2.5 (interquartile range, 1.8 to 3.3) on the Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 
(RAPID3),19 on a scale ranging from 1 to 10, with higher values indicating a greater 
severity. Results also indicated low inflammatory disease activity, with a median score of 1.8 
(interquartile range, 1.7 to 2.0) on the disease activity score in 44 joints (DAS44),20 on a 
scale ranging from 0 to 10, with higher values indicating more active disease. Post-
vaccination elevations in autoantibodies were not observed. A knee arthrocentesis in 1 
participant yielded 40 ml of fluid with 7190 leukocytes per milliliter (80% monocytes) and 
rVSV at 1200 copies per milliliter on PCR assay, whereas synovial viral and bacterial 
cultures and rVSV viremia remained negative. No association between the presence of 
arthritis and vaccine dose, age, sex, earlier arthralgia, or peak viremia was observed among 
the Geneva participants. Suspected, self-limited relapses, one with mild arthralgia and the 
other with mild arthritis, occurred in 2 participants after a prolonged pain-free interval 
(Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). At the 6-month visit, 10 of 11 participants with 
arthritis were symptom-free. Two self-limited cases of arthritis were observed, one each in 
Hamburg and Kilifi. (Details regarding these cases are provided in the Supplementary 
Appendix.)

 Skin Lesions—Among the 11 participants in Geneva who had arthritis, a mild 
maculopapular rash mainly on the limbs developed in 3 participants between days 7 and 9 
and lasted 7 to 15 days (Fig. 2A, subpanel a). The rash was associated with a few tender 
vesicles on fingers or toes (Fig. 2B, subpanel d). Histologic analysis of one papule revealed a 
dermal T-lymphocytic infiltrate (Fig. 2A, subpanels b and c). Vesicular lesions reflected 
subepidermal dermatitis with necrotic keratinocytes (Fig. 2B, subpanel d) containing 
abundant VSV antigens (Fig. 2B, subpanel f).21 Among the 3 participants with rash, rVSV 
was identified on RT-PCR in all 3 up to day 17, and infectious rVSV was isolated from a 
specimen with the highest RNA level 9 days after immunization (Fig. 2C). Concomitantly 
obtained plasma samples remained negative, showing local replication. At other VEBCON 
trial sites, investigators screened participants for rVSV-associated dermatologic findings, but 
none were observed.
ZEBOV-Glycoprotein–Specific Antibody Responses
Serum antibodies induced by rVSV-ZEBOV were assessed with the use of four distinct 
assays. Baseline antibody levels were generally low, with outliers. Low-level baseline 
seropositivity was identified in 12 of 23 participants (52%) in Lambaréné and occasionally 
at other sites (Table 2 and Fig. 3A, and Tables S7 through S11 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
Four weeks after immunization, ZEBOV-glycoprotein–specific antibodies were detected on 
ELISA in all vaccinees with similar anti-glycoprotein geometric mean titers and distribution, 
as seen on reverse cumulative distribution curves (Fig. 3E). The lowest dose (300,000 PFU) 
was immunogenic in Lambaréné, although among participants receiving this dose, a low 
response rate was more frequent than among those receiving higher doses (Fig. 3A through 
3D). Rates of seropositivity (0 to 53%) and titers were lower on whole-virion ELISA (Fig. 
3B, and Table S9 and Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix), which identified baseline 
antibodies reacting with nucleocapsid or matrix proteins, but not glycoprotein, in samples 
from Lambaréné (Fig. S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).
On pseudovirion neutralization assay assessing the 50% serum neutralization capacity 
(PsVNA50), neutralizing antibodies were absent at baseline (including among participants in 
Lambaréné) but were elicited at day 28 in 107 of 126 vaccinees (85%) (Fig. 3C, and Table 
S10 in the Supplementary Appendix). With the use of infectious ZEBOV particles, low-level 
neutralizing antibodies (≥1:8) were detected at baseline in 6 of 20 participants (30%) in 
Hamburg, 7 of 40 (18%) in Kilifi, and 10 of 38 (26%) in Lambaréné (Fig. 3D, and Table S10 
in the Supplementary Appendix). The two assays showed significant increases in 
neutralizing antibodies after any dose of rVSV-ZEBOV (Tables S10 and S11 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Despite strong correlations between day 28 antibody titers on glycoprotein ELISA and on 
PsVNA50 (Fig. S7 in the Supplementary Appendix), significant differences were observed. 
In the randomized, controlled Geneva study, a dose of 50 million PFU elicited titers of 
glycoprotein-binding antibodies that were similar to those elicited by 10 million PFU, with 
geometric mean titers of 1780 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1048 to 3022) and 1064 (95% 
CI, 757 to 1495), respectively, but significantly higher PsVNA50 antibody titers, with

 geometric mean titers of 273 (95% CI, 157 to 475) and 99 (95% CI, 62 to 159) (P = 0.02). 
The influence of increasing doses on the distribution of neutralizing antibodies was 
confirmed on reverse cumulative distribution (Fig. 3F) and correlation analyses (Tables S12 
and S13 and Fig. S8 in the Supplementary Appendix). Thus, higher doses of rVSV-ZEBOV 
elicited similar glycoprotein-binding titers but higher neutralizing-antibody titers. Across the 
four study sites, a weak but significant correlation between vaccine dose and the level of 
glycoprotein-binding antibodies was observed (Fig. S8 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Six months after immunization, glycoprotein-binding antibodies persisted in all participants, 
across doses and study sites, without a significant decline in geometric mean titers (Table 2 
and Fig. 3A, and Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). Antibody titers more than 
doubled after day 28 in 41 of 126 participants (33%) and reached significantly higher 
geometric mean titers of 10 million PFU at 180 days in Geneva recipients (geometric mean 
ratio of 180-day titer to 28-day titer, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.21 to 2.09; P = 0.004). The deployment 
of 8 participants to Ebola-affected countries during the Ebola outbreak was not reflected by 
an increase in antibody titers.
On the basis of whole-virion ELISA, we also observed sustained antibody titers, which 
declined significantly only in Geneva recipients of 50 million PFU (geometric mean ratio of 
180-day titer to 28-day titer, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.91; P = 0.03) (Fig. 3B, and Table S9 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). Neutralizing antibodies that were detected with infectious 
ZEBOV particles also persisted through 180 days in 45 of 73 participants (62%) (Fig. 3D, 
and Table S11 in the Supplementary Appendix). In contrast, antibodies that were measured 
by means of the pseudovirion neutralization assay were up to 94% lower at 180 days than at 
28 days and persisted in only 28 of 120 participants (23%) (Table S10 and Fig. 3C in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Nevertheless, a strong correlation between antibody titers on 
PsVNA50 and on glycoprotein ELISA persisted at 180 days, which suggests a rapid decline 
in initially modest PsVNA50 titers (Fig. S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Discussion
The Zaire-variant candidate vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV expresses a viral surface glycoprotein 
that has immunogenic potential after a single dose for populations at risk for Ebola virus 
disease, as well as possibly for postexposure prophylaxis.4,7,17,22 It is a replication-
competent chimeric virus for which human-safety data were limited to a single postexposure 
case report21 at the time of the initiation of these studies. We describe the safety and 
immunogenicity results for rVSV-ZEBOV in African and European populations, collected in 
four harmonized, ongoing trials, including three dose-escalating trials and one randomized, 
controlled trial.
Acute inflammatory symptoms were expected after immunization with rVSV-ZEBOV. The 
frequency and intensity of such symptoms were study-dependent. At a vaccine dose of 3 
million PFU, objective fever was reported in 20 to 30% of vaccinees in Hamburg and Kilifi 
but in only 10% in Lambaréné. An influence of dose on adverse events was noted between a 
dose of 300,000 and 3 million PFU in Lambaréné but not between higher doses at other 
sites. It is likely that the early onset, short duration, and responsiveness to symptomatic

 treatment of these symptoms will facilitate acceptance of the vaccine, but vaccine-induced 
fever should be anticipated if rVSV-ZEBOV is administered to contacts of patients infected 
with Ebola virus disease.
Levels of rVSV RNA were transiently detected in early blood samples, suggesting that 
innate responses, especially those involving the type I interferon pathway, help to limit viral 
replication.23–26 Viral seeding of joints and skin, mostly identified in the Geneva cohort, 
was unexpected. It showed that viral dissemination and replication can occur and persist for 
up to 2 to 3 weeks after immunization — in other words, that early innate responses may not 
always be sufficient for complete viral control. Replication appeared to be restricted to 
permissive tissues: viral RNA remained below detection in plasma and peripheral-blood 
mononuclear cells, and replicating virus was retrieved only from skin vesicles. Skin vesicles 
in livestock infected with VSV or foot-and-mouth virus occur at similar locations, reflecting 
the relative resistance of keratinocytes to type I interferon.27 The pattern of rVSV-ZEBOV 
replication in humans thus may be defined by the permissiveness of rVSV replication.28,29
In the Geneva cohort, arthritis was confirmed in 9 of 51 participants (18%) and suspected in 
another 2. Two cases were reported among 60 participants in Hamburg and Kilifi (3%), 
albeit at a lower intensity and of shorter duration than in Geneva. Possible mechanisms of 
virus-induced arthritis include autoimmunity, lytic effects of infected synovial cells, and the 
deposition of immune complexes. The induction of autoimmunity is not supported by the 
rapid onset (<2 weeks) and the lack of vaccine-induced pathogenic antibodies. We cannot 
rule out immune-complex deposition, but the detection of rVSV RNA in synovial fluid 
showed the seeding of rVSV-ZEBOV into joints. Since arthralgia or arthritis is not elicited 
by VSV and was not reported with other rVSV constructs that have been tested to date, the 
pathophysiology of the chimeric rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine may include features attributable to 
both its VSV and ZEBOV glycoprotein components. Although pain may be prolonged and 
relapse may occur, the prognosis of viral vaccine–induced arthritides is considered favorable 
on the basis of experience with rubella vaccination.30 Accordingly, the VEBCON data and 
safety monitoring board concluded on January 1, 2015, that the trials could proceed as 
originally planned (including doses up to 100 million PFU) once informed-consent forms 
were updated. Of the 13 participants with arthritis, 10 were symptom-free at the 6-month 
visit, which suggests a favorable long-term prognosis for these vaccine-induced arthritides.
The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine generated glycoprotein-binding antibodies in all participants at 
any dose, showing its immunogenicity in humans, in accordance with the field efficacy 
subsequently reported from Guinea.31 Doses containing as few as 300,000 PFU may be 
sufficient to elicit glycoprotein-binding antibodies. Preexisting antibodies to ZEBOV 
nucleocapsid or matrix proteins conferred no advantage for the induction of glycoprotein-
specific responses (Fig. S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). Neutralizing antibodies were 
also generated in most participants, and a dose–response effect was shown. Despite similar 
glycoprotein-binding antibody titers, higher vaccine doses elicited higher titers of 
neutralizing antibodies. Since the relative roles of neutralizing and glycoprotein-binding 
antibodies in protection against Ebola virus disease are unknown, we cannot conclude 
whether higher vaccine doses are required for the most effective protection. A comparison of 
anti–glycoprotein-antibody titers detected in this study (in the Hamburg cohort receiving 20

 million PFU) with those reported with a chimpanzee adenovirus vector32 revealed similar 
values. This finding suggests that the two vaccines that are currently undergoing testing in 
West Africa may induce humoral responses of the same order of magnitude.
Antibody persistence is expected to play a critical role in the duration of protection induced 
by rVSV-ZEBOV, a factor that cannot currently be informed by efficacy studies. The 
persistence of glycoprotein-binding antibody titers through 180 days is promising and 
suggests that a single dose of rVSV-ZEBOV may be sufficient for early31 and possibly 
longer-term protection. In the absence of established correlates of protection, the importance 
of the low titers and rapid decline of antibodies capable of inhibiting cell entry, as measured 
by means of the PsVNA50 assay, is uncertain.
These studies have contributed to the dose-selection process performed by the vaccine 
manufacturers and have raised the awareness of investigators, members of institutional 
review boards, and regulators about the specific adverse events to be expected with the use 
of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine. They have also resulted in the introduction of safety-driven 
changes in the protocols for the ongoing phase 2 and 3 studies.
In conclusion, in four rapidly implemented, parallel phase 1 studies that included in-depth 
safety investigations, the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine was found to be reactogenic but 
immunogenic at doses ranging from 300,000 to 50 million PFU in African and European 
volunteers, with higher titers of antibodies at higher doses. The viral dissemination in skin 
and joints that was observed in some participants appears to be self-limited, which has 
resulted in a favorable risk–benefit balance, given the possible protection31 offered by this 
vaccine in the potential control of outbreaks of Ebola virus disease.

indicated for each site in Panels A through D; the shaded areas indicate negative titers. The 
numbers of samples tested are provided in Figure S4 in the Supplementary Appendix. 
Antibodies were measured on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against the 
homologous glycoprotein (GP) of the Zaire–Kikwit strain (ZEBOV, Panel A) or inactivated 
whole virions of the Zaire–Guéckédou strain (Panel B). Results are expressed as end-point 
titers (Panel A) or the geometric mean concentration of arbitrary ELISA units (AEU) per 
milliliter (Panel B). Neutralizing antibodies were detected with the use of rVSV 
pseudovirion neutralization assay assessing the 50% serum neutralization capacity 
(PsVNA50) complemented by homologous glycoprotein (Panel C) or with infectious 
ZEBOV isolate Mayinga (Panel D). Geometric mean titers and 95% confidence intervals are 
shown for each study site, dose group, and time point. The results of glycoprotein ELISA 
(Panel E) and pseudoneutralization (Panel F) at 28 days were expressed as the reciprocal of 
the highest dilution showing a positive result. The curves represent the distribution of
