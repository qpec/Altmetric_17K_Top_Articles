Objectives To understand how device-measured 
sedentary behaviour and physical activity are related to 
all-cause mortality in older men, an age group with high 
levels of inactivity and sedentary behaviour.
Methods Prospective population-based cohort study of 
men recruited from 24 UK General Practices in 1978–
1980. In 2010–2012, 3137 surviving men were invited 
to a follow-up, 1655 (aged 71–92 years) agreed. Nurses 
measured height and weight, men completed health 
and demographic questionnaires and wore an ActiGraph 
GT3x accelerometer. All-cause mortality was collected 
through National Health Service central registers up to 1 
June 2016.
results After median 5.0 years’ follow-up, 194 
deaths occurred in 1181 men without pre-existing 
cardiovascular disease. For each additional 30 min in 
sedentary behaviour, or light physical activity (LIPA), or 
10 min in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), 
HRs for mortality were 1.17 (95% CI 1.10 to 1.25), 
0.83 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.90) and 0.90 (95% CI 0.84 to 
0.96), respectively. Adjustments for confounders did 
not meaningfully change estimates. Only LIPA remained 
significant on mutual adjustment for all intensities. The 
HR for accumulating 150 min MVPA/week in sporadic 
minutes (achieved by 66% of men) was 0.59 (95% 
CI 0.43 to 0.81) and 0.58 (95% CI 0.33 to 1.00) for 
accumulating 150 min MVPA/week in bouts lasting 
≥10 min (achieved by 16% of men). Sedentary breaks 
were not associated with mortality.
Conclusions In older men, all activities (of light 
intensity upwards) were beneficial and accumulation 
of activity in bouts ≥10 min did not appear important 
beyond total volume of activity. Findings can inform 
physical activity guidelines for older adults.
Nearly all epidemiological evidence used to esti-
mate the shape of the dose–response curve between 
physical activity (PA) and mortality is based on 
self-reported PA.1 Moderately active compared 
with inactive adults have 20%–30% reductions 
in all-cause mortality, with greater reductions in 
older (>65 years) than middle-aged adults.2 PA is 
a key determinant of longevity globally.3 Current 
activity guidelines suggest accumulating 
≥150 
min 
moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) per week in bouts 
lasting 
≥10 
min.4 5 The 10 
min bout requirement was 
based on trial data for cardiometabolic risk factors 
only, not clinical end points.5 In order to test whether 
the accumulation of MVPA in 
≥10 
min bouts affects 
risk of mortality, prospective cohort studies with 
device-measured physical activity (which can provide 
minute by minute data for calculation of bouts) and 
mortality data are required, but few studies have such 
data. Such data can also inform whether accruing 
sedentary time in prolonged bouts is associated with 
adverse effects on mortality, as this has been identified 
as an important research gap.6 Many studies report 
that higher levels of self-reported sedentary time are 
associated with mortality,7–10 although self-reported 
sedentary behaviours may suffer from measurement 
error or recall bias.11–15 Experimental studies suggest 
benefits of breaking up sedentary time for metabolic 
and haemostatic markers.16 17 Hence, activity guide-
lines now suggest avoiding ‘long’ sedentary periods, 
but without quantifying how ‘long’ is detrimental.4 
Recently, prospective cohort studies using body-
worn devices to measure PA report that more time 
spent in MVPA is associated with lower mortality 
risks and sedentary behaviour with higher risks.18–28 
However, few address the question of pattern of 
accumulation of activity rather than total volume. 
Most of the studies use the US National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 
data set,18–24 and not all findings are consistent.18 23 
There is little information from other populations 
and older age groups, >80 years.
We address important gaps in knowledge by 
focusing on older men: older adults are increas-
ingly important given global population ageing. 
We use a community-dwelling cohort of older 
British men to investigate how device-measured 
PA is associated with all-cause mortality (including 
light PA (LIPA) and sedentary behaviour which are 
the predominant activities in this age group29). 
Importantly, we fill a research gap by investigating 
dose–response associations,6 testing for linear and 
non-linear associations in order to understand 
whether the reductions in mortality risk for higher 
levels of physical activity are linear, or if there is 
a threshold level at which the benefits per unit 
of activity decrease (and conversely for seden-
tary behaviour). We also investigate whether, as 
suggested elsewhere,30 the association of seden-
tary behaviour with mortality depends on PA level.

aspect of this paper is that we investigate patterns of accumu-
lation of activity (including bout length and sedentary breaks) 
in relation to mortality. Answers to these questions will help 
inform future guidelines for older adults.
MeThOds
sample
The British Regional Heart Study is a prospective cohort study of 
7735 men recruited from a single general practice in each of 24 
British towns in 1978–1980 (ages 40–59 years). In 2010–2012, 
survivors (n=3137) were invited to a physical examination.31
Measurements at 2010–2012 examination
Objective physical activity assessment
Men wore a GT3x accelerometer (ActiGraph, Pensacola, 
FL, USA) over the right hip for 7 days, during waking hours, 
removing it for bathing and swimming (2% reported swimming). 
Data were processed using standard methods described previ-
ously.29 Non-wear time was excluded using the R package ‘Phys-
ical Activity’.29 32 By convention, we defined valid wear days 
as 
≥600 
min wear time, and included participants with 
≥3 
valid 
days. Each minute of activity was categorised using intensity 
threshold values of counts per minute (CPM) developed for 
older adults: <100 for sedentary behaviour (<1.5 
Metabolic 
Equivalent of Task (MET)), 100–1040 for light activity (LIPA) 
(1.5–3 MET) and >1040 for MVPA (≥3 
MET).33
Body mass index
Body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) was calculated from nurse-mea-
sured height (Harpenden stadiometer) and weight in light indoor 
clothing (Tanita body composition analyser (BC-418-MA)).
Questionnaire data
Men’s self-reported information included: current cigarette 
smoking, alcohol consumption, usual duration of night-time 
sleep, whether they lived alone and had pre-existing cardiovas-
cular disease (CVD) (ever received a doctor diagnosis of heart 
attack, heart failure or stroke (with symptoms lasting 
>24 
hours)). 
Mobility disability was present if the men reported being unable 
to do any of: (1) walking 200 yards without stopping and without 
discomfort; (2) climbing a flight of 12 stairs without holding on 
and taking a rest; or (3) bending down and picking up a shoe 
from the floor. Social class was based on longest held occupa-
tion at study entry (1978–1980) and categorised as manual and 
non-manual for parsimony (sensitivity analyses used the full 
seven categories of occupation and four categories of age leaving 
education). Region of residence (1978–1980) was grouped into 
Scotland, North, Midlands and South of England.
Mortality
Men were followed-up for all-cause mortality through National 
Health Service central registers until 1 June 2016.
Patient involvement
Participants had the opportunity to contribute their views on 
future research priorities for the study, and detailed feedback about 
physical activity levels from the accelerometer study was given on 
request. A summary of the findings of the study and update on 
progress of the accelerometer study was mailed to the participants 
yearly.
statistical methods
Means, medians or proportions of covariates selected a priori 
were calculated according to quartiles of time spent in MVPA 
and sedentary behaviour. Cox proportional hazards models 
were used to estimate the HRs for mortality according to (1) 
total steps per day and total daily minutes in (2) MVPA, (3) 
LIPA and (4) sedentary behaviour, measured in 2010–2012. 
Each activity measure was analysed (1) in quartiles and (2) as 
a continuous variable. To aid interpretation, HRs were esti-
mated for each increase in 1000 steps, 30 min of sedentary 
behaviour or LIPA and 10 min of MVPA. Model 1 was adjusted 
for measurement-related factors (average accelerometer wear 
time (min/day), season of wear (warm, May to September or 
cold, October to April), age, region of residence). Model 2 
additionally adjusted for: social class, living alone, duration 
of sleep, smoking status, alcohol consumption and BMI. 
Model 3 further adjusted for presence of mobility disability. 
Model 4 also adjusted for other intensity of PA to investigate 
whether (1) MVPA and sedentary behaviour and (2) MVPA 
and LIPA were associated with mortality independent of each 
other. Model 5 adjusted simultaneously for MVPA, LIPA and 
sedentary behaviour as continuous variables (partition model). 
The linearity of associations between each measure of PA and 
sedentary behaviour and mortality was tested by comparing 
linear models with quadratic models using a likelihood ratio 
test in Stata, based on a priori expectations. Where non-linear 
associations were detected, the shape of the non-linear associ-
ation was estimated using penalised splines in R. The penalised 
spline is a non-parametric estimation method which makes 
few assumptions about the underlying shape of the associa-
tion. Predicted values from spline models were plotted. The 
Akaike information criterion (AIC) was compared between 
linear and spline models.
We estimated the HR for mortality among men who accu-
mulated ≥150 min MVPA/week (1) in bouts lasting ≥1 min 
and (1) in bouts lasting ≥10 min. For MVPA and LIPA, we 
also compared minutes in bouts lasting 1–9 min with minutes 
in bouts of ≥10 min, testing the difference in coefficients 
using a post hoc test. For sedentary behaviour, we compared 
bouts lasting 1–15 min, 16–30, 31–60 and over 61 min. We 
estimated the HR for mortality for the number of sedentary 
breaks per hour (defined as the interruption of a sedentary 
bout lasting >1 min by ≥1 min of LIPA or MVPA). The number 
of sedentary breaks per hour was split into quartiles for anal-
ysis, models were adjusted for total sedentary time. Sensitivity 
analyses (reported in the online supplementary appendix 1) 
investigated (1) the skewed distribution of MVPA, (2) the 
percentage of the day spent in each activity, (3) excluding the 
first year of follow-up and (4) excluding men with disability 
and pre-existing CVD, (5) including men with pre-existing 
CVD (6) confounding by socioeconomic status. Analyses were 
conducted in Stata V
.14.234 and R V
.3.4.0.35
resulTs
Of 3137 surviving men, 1566 (50%) agreed to participate and 
returned an accelerometer with data. Of these, 1528 (49%) 
had 
≥600 
min/day wear time on 
≥3 days. 254 men with pre-ex-
isting heart attack, heart failure or stroke were excluded, leaving 
1274 men. Participants’ mean age was 78.4 (range 71–92) years 
(table 1). Mean accelerometer wear time was 855 
min/day, of which 
616 
min was in sedentary behaviour and 199 
min in LIPA. MVPA 
minutes had a right-skewed distribution, median 33 
min (IQR 
16–56) (table 1). There were dose–response associations across

quartiles of MVPA, where men who were more active compared 
with less active were younger, less likely to smoke cigarettes and 
had lower alcohol consumption, BMI and prevalence of mobility 
disability, and spent less time in sedentary behaviour (table 1). 
Similarly, dose–response associations, in the opposite direction, 
were observed over quartiles of sedentary behaviour (data not 
presented). The distribution of bouts spent in each activity inten-
sity is presented in online supplementary table 1.
PA, sedentary behaviour and all-cause mortality
During a median follow-up of 5.0 years (range 0.2–6.1), 194 deaths 
occurred. For each additional 30 
min in sedentary behaviour and 
LIPA or 10 
min in MVPA, HRs for all-cause mortality (model 1) 
were respectively 1.17 (95% CI 1.10 to 1.25) (table 2), 0.83 (95% 
CI 0.77 to 0.90) (table 3) and 0.90 (95% CI 0.84 to 0.96) (table 4). 
For each additional 1000 steps/day the HR was 0.84 (95% CI 0.78 
to 0.91) (table 5). Adjustments for sociodemographic factors, 
health behaviours and sleep time (model 2) and mobility disability 
(model 3) minimally affected the estimates and CIs. Adjustment 
for MVPA (model 4) did not meaningfully change associations for 
sedentary behaviour (table 2) or LIPA (table 3), but adjustment 
for sedentary time reduced the association for MVPA to 1.00 
(95% CI 0.92 to 1.09) (table 4). In the partition model (model 5, 
tables 2–4), only LIPA was significant at HR 0.86 (95% CI 0.78 to 
0.94 per 30 
min/day) on mutual adjustment for MVPA, sedentary 
behaviour and sleep time. There were dose–response associations 
across quartiles of activity, with higher risk in higher quartiles of 
sedentary behaviour (table 2) and lower risk in higher quartiles of 
MVPA (table 4) and steps (table 5).
shape of associations
Likelihood ratio tests suggested better fit for quadratic than 
linear models of step count or MVPA minutes (both P<0.001) 
and all-cause mortality. In models for steps and MVPA, the incre-
ment in goodness of fit (based on AIC) between linear and spline 
models was minimal (online supplementary table 2). Plots of 
estimated splines (online supplementary figures 1 and 2) did not 
show great deviations from linearity. Hence, for clinical inter-
pretation, the simpler linear model was adequate.
bouts of activity and all-cause mortality
Table 6 presents the HR for mortality for each minute of 
MVPA spent in bouts; the HR per minute of MVPA spent in 
bouts lasting 1–9 
min was 0.99 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.00), and 
0.99 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.01) per minute of MVPA spent in bouts 
lasting ≥10 
min; HRs did not differ (post hoc test P=0.59). 
Equivalent estimates for LIPA were HR 0.99 (0.99, 1.00) and 
1.00 (0.99, 1.01), respectively (HRs did not differ; post hoc test 
P=0.48). Adjusting for presence of mobility disability attenuated 
HRs.
The HR for accumulating 150 min MVPA/week in sporadic 
minutes (achieved by 66% of men) was 0.59 (95% CI 0.43 
to 0.81) in model 1, and was not meaningfully changed in 
models 2 and 3 (data not presented). The HR for accumulating 
150 min MVPA/week in bouts lasting ≥10 min (achieved by 
16% of men) was 0.58 (95% CI 0.33 to 1.00) in model 1, and 
changed little in model 3. The model for ‘meeting the guide-
lines in bouts of ≥1 minute’ (yes/no) is not adjusted for total 
MVPA time per week, because the binary variable cuts the total

MVPA time per week at 150 min/week, so the two are highly 
correlated (r>0.8).
The numbers of minutes spent in sedentary bouts lasting 
1–15 
min, 16–30, 31–60 and >61 
min were all similarly asso-
ciated with mortality; each HR 1.01 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.01) per 
minute fully adjusted (table 6). Analyses of number of seden-
tary breaks found that the HR for mortality among men in 
higher quartiles did not differ compared with the lowest quartile 
(table 7). See online supplementary appendix 1 for results of 
sensitivity analyses.
disCussiOn
Among community-dwelling older men, we observed consistent 
prospective associations between higher total daily step count, 
minutes spent in LIPA or MVPA, lower sedentary time and lower 
risk of all-cause mortality. Associations changed little after adjust-
ment for other health behaviours, BMI, presence of mobility 
disability and wear time. Associations of LIPA with mortality 
were only slightly further attenuated after adjustment for time 
spent in sedentary behaviour and MVPA, although associations 
between MVPA and mortality were entirely attenuated after 
adjustment for sedentary behaviour. The lower mortality risks 
were gained across the spectrum of activity levels, not confined 
to a particular threshold level. The total volume rather than 
pattern of accrual of physical activity was the most important 
influence on mortality.
Our data extend evidence to an older population (range 
72–91 years at baseline), which is important as data on the over 
80s are sparse,25 and to a non-US population (most reports use 
US data,18–25 27 28 nearly all use one data source). Few studies

of device-measured activity and mortality have looked at light 
activity,21 36 or tested non-linearity in activity–mortality associa-
tions,24 26 27 and only one investigated bouts of MVPA,23 whereas 
we look at specific bouts of MVPA, LIPA, sedentary behaviour as 
well as the number of breaks in sedentary time.
PA intensity and duration
Overall in our older aged sample of men, the associations 
between PA and mortality tended to be stronger than in 
younger adults, in line with findings of a meta-analysis of 
self-reported PA in relation to mortality.2 Comparing our 
findings with other studies with objective PA data is difficult 
because definitions of activity intensity and analysis methods 
vary. We found that each 30 min/day increase in sedentary 
behaviour was associated with a 15% increase in mortality risk, 
after exclusion of men with pre-existing CVD and exclusion 
of the first year of follow-up data. However, the adjustments 
for LIPA and MVPA in the partition model fully attenuated 
the association. While an early NHANES study reported that 
accelerometer-measured sedentary behaviour was associated 
with incident mortality,18 a study with longer follow-up and 
excluding prevalent CVD and deaths in the first 2 years of 
follow-up did not find significant associations.23 Additionally, 
a recent study of older women found that the raised risks of 
mortality associated with higher sedentary time were fully 
attenuated after adjusting for MVPA.28
In our study, each 30 
min/day increase in LIPA was associated 
with a 17% reduction in mortality, which was robust to adjust-
ment for sedentary behaviour and MVPA, suggesting that the 
increase in LIPA rather than the reduction in sedentary behaviour 
was most important. In a younger NHANES sample, a reduction 
in mortality of 16% was found per hour of LIPA.36 They defined 
LIPA as >2020 CPM (compared with >1040 CPM in our 
study), and did not adjust for MVPA or account for pre-existing 
disease.36 Another analysis of NHANES found a 17% reduction 
in mortality per hour of LIPA adjusted for MVPA, but using 
lower cut points (100–760 CPM).24 In contrast, a study of older 
women did not find that LIPA was associated with consistent 
reductions in mortality, although different definition of LIPA 
was used.28

Original article
We found that each 10 
min/day increase in MVPA was associated 
with a 10% reduction in mortality (approximately 75% reduction 
per hour), which was not explained by adjustment for behavioural 
and social confounders and mobility disability whereas in NHANES 
data, the adjusted estimate was approximately 40% reduction per 
hour MVPA, but using a lower cut point (>760 
CPM) to define 
MVPA.24 However, in models adjusting simultaneously for all 
intensities of activity, significant associations were observed only for 
LIPA, suggesting that among older men the lighter intensity stimulus 
is sufficient for prevention of mortality. The associations between 
LIPA and mortality were robust to adjustment for behavioural and 
social confounders and mobility disability, but future work should 
investigate the dose of activity that is protective against geriatric 
syndromes (such as cognitive and functional limitations), which 
may be on the pathway to raised risks of mortality and are increas-
ingly important for elderly health and well-being.
We found that each increase of 1000 steps/day was associated 
with a 15% reduction in mortality, compared with a 6% reduc-
tion in the younger Australian and Tasmanian cohorts (average 
age <60 years at baseline).26
non-linearity of associations
Given the very marginal benefits of the non-linear models, we 
concluded that more steps, LIPA and MVPA and less seden-
tary behaviour are beneficial, rather than there being a particular 
threshold for benefits to accrue.
Pattern of activity: bouts and breaks
Many PA guidelines advise accumulating MVPA in bouts lasting 
over 10 
min and avoiding long spells of sedentary behaviour.4 5 If 
pattern of activity beyond total volume was important, we would

expect the minutes spent in bouts of MVPA lasting ≥10 
min to 
be more strongly associated with mortality than minutes spent 
in shorter bouts (and the same for shorter bouts of sedentary 
behaviour), but our findings did not support this. Further-
more, the benefit from accumulating 150 
min sporadically was 
very similar to accumulating it in bouts ≥10 
min. This suggests 
that total volume of PA rather than the pattern is important. 
Hence, for older men, for all-cause mortality at least, accumu-
lating bouts of activity lasting ≥10 
min may not be important. 
However, these analyses should be replicated in larger samples. 
We found no evidence that sedentary breaks were associated 
with mortality risk, once total sedentary time was accounted for, 
indicating that in this age group, total time rather than pattern 
of accumulation may be key. Taken together with the partition 
analysis results, this suggests that the guidelines for older adults 
may do better to focus on increasing time spent in light (or more 
intense) activity in order to gain the benefits of activity and by 
implication displace sedentary time, rather than encouraging 
breaks in sedentary periods as a means to reduce sedentary bout 
length. To our knowledge, only two other studies have directly 
examined bouts; one found that more time spent in MVPA bouts 
of ≥10 
min was associated with lower mortality, but that seden-
tary bouts were not associated with mortality,23 and the other 
study concluded that longer sedentary bouts were associated 
with raised mortality risk.27
interactions of physical activity with other variables
It is suggested that the raised mortality risks associated with 
higher sedentary time are heightened in people with low MVPA 
levels.30 We did not find strong evidence to suggest this, but a strat-
ified analysis suggested stronger associations between sedentary 
behaviour and mortality in the less active men. This is consistent 
with data from a meta-analysis including over 1 
million indi-
viduals using self-reported PA, and sedentary behaviour found 
that the risks of sedentary behaviour were more pronounced in 
the less active individuals.30 T
wo analyses of device-measured 
activity in NHANES data reported similar patterns,19 24 but in a 
study of older adults, the reverse was found.25
strengths and limitations
This study benefits from prospectively collected data on expo-
sures, important confounders and mediators and mortality. PA 
was measured using accelerometers and the PA intensities defined 
using age-appropriate and validated cut points.33 The sedentary 
behaviour measure does not include postural data and could 
include some standing time; however, hip-worn ActiGraph-mea-
sured sedentary behaviour has minimal bias compared with 
thigh-worn activPAL-measured sedentary behaviour (correla-
tion r=0.76) in a sample of middle-aged adults.37 In a sample of 
healthy older adults, the ActiGraph cut point of <100 
CPM has 
an estimated 93% sensitivity and 58% specificity; 11.8% of time 
classified by activPAL as standing was classified by accelerom-
eter as sedentary38; however, in comparison, our sample is older 
and less healthy, so likely to engage in less prolonged standing 
time, which would improve classification. The response rate to 
the accelerometer study was similar or superior to other studies 
of older adults; nevertheless, participants were more often 
younger, and had healthier behaviours than non-participants, 
and may therefore have been more physically active and less 
sedentary than the general population. Data are from a popula-
tion-based cohort of community-dwelling older predominantly 
white British men, so results may not apply to women, other 
ethnicities or younger men; however, other studies have not 
found evidence that the associations between PA or sedentary 
behaviour and mortality differ by gender18 24 26 27 36 and a recent 
study of older women finds associations in the same direction 
as ours, although due to methodological differences it is hard to 
compare effect sizes.28 Given that LIPA and sedentary time are 
highly correlated, it can be difficult to distinguish their effects; 
we did not use isotemporal substitution analyses as the seden-
tary behaviour and LIPA were too highly correlated, resulting in 
problems with collinearity and model convergence. In sensitivity 
analyses, our findings did not meaningfully change after exclu-
sion of men with mobility disability, prevalent CVD and the first 
year of follow-up, suggesting findings are not likely to be due to 
reverse causality.
COnClusiOns
The dose–response associations between sedentary behaviour 
and mortality as well as inverse associations between MVPA and 
LIPA suggest that among older men there are sustained benefits 
to longevity from physical activity of all intensities, from LIPA 
upwards. Results suggest that all activities, however modest, are 
beneficial. The finding that LIPA is associated with lower risk 
of mortality is especially important among older men, as most 
of their daily PA is light intensity. Furthermore, the pattern of 
accumulation of physical activity did not appear to alter the 
associations with mortality, suggesting that it would be benefi-
cial to encourage older men to be active irrespective of bouts. 
Future work should replicate the investigation into bouts of 
activity in larger samples and including women. Given the rapid 
decline in physical activity with age among the oldest old popu-
lations, encouraging even light activity may provide benefits for 
longevity.
What are the findings?
 
► In older British men, accumulating more minutes of activity 
from light intensity upwards was associated with lower 
all-cause mortality.
 
► There was no evidence to suggest that accumulating 
moderate to vigorous activity in bouts lasting ≥10 min 
lowered risk of mortality compared with accumulating 
activity in shorter bouts, nor that breaking up sedentary time 
was associated with lower mortality risks.
how might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
Findings could refine physical activity guidelines and make 
them more achievable for older adults with low activity levels: 
stressing the benefits of all activities, however modest, from light 
intensity upwards; second, encouraging accumulating activity 
of all intensities without the need to sustain bouts of 10 min or 
more.
