 Prevalence, Characteristics, and Treatment Patterns
of Hearing Difficulty in the United States
Hossein Mahboubi, MD, MPH; Harrison W. Lin, MD; Neil Bhattacharyya, MD
IMPORTANCE Hearing loss is one of the most prevalent chronic conditions in the United
States and has been associated with negative physical, social, cognitive, economic, and
emotional consequences. Despite the high prevalence of hearing loss, substantial gaps in the
utilization of amplification options, including hearing aids and cochlear implants (CI), have
been identified.
OBJECTIVE To investigate the contemporary prevalence, characteristics, and patterns of
specialty referral, evaluation, and treatment of hearing difficulty among adults in the United
States.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A cross-sectional analysis of responses from a
nationwide clustered representative sample of adults who participated in the 2014 National
Health Interview Survey and responded to the hearing module questions was carried out.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Data regarding demographics as well as self-reported
hearing status, functional hearing, laterality, onset, and primary cause of the hearing loss
were collected. In addition, specific data regarding hearing-related clinician visits, hearing
tests, referrals to hearing specialist, and utilization of hearing aids and CIs were analyzed.
RESULTS Among 239.6 million adults, 40.3 million (16.8%) indicated their hearing was less
than “
excellent/good,”ranging from “
a little trouble hearing”to “
deaf.”The mean (SD) age of
participants was 47 (0.2) years with 48.2% being men and 51.8% women. Approximately
48.8 million (20.6%) had visited a physician for hearing problems in the preceding 5 years. Of
these, 32.6% were referred to an otolaryngologist and 27.3% were referred to an audiologist.
Functional hearing was reported as the ability to hear “whispering”or “normal voice”(225.4
million; 95.5%), to “
only hear shouting”(8.0 million; 3.4%), and “not appreciating shouting”
(2.8 million; 1.1%). Among the last group, 5.3% were recommended to have a CI, of which
22.1% had received one. Of the adults who indicated their hearing from “
a little trouble
hearing”to being “
deaf,”12.9 million (32.2%) had never seen a clinician for hearing problems
and 11.1 million (28.0%) had never had their hearing tested.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE There are considerable gaps between self-reported hearing
loss and patients receiving medical evaluation and recommended treatments for hearing loss.
Improved awareness regarding referrals to otolaryngologists and audiologists as well as
auditory rehabilitative options among clinicians may improve hearing loss care.

 H
earing loss is one of the most prevalent chronic con-
ditions in the United States, affecting approximately
16% of the adult population, corresponding to 29 mil-
lion Americans.1 The prevalence of hearing loss increases with
age and, according to a national study,1 77% of adults aged 60
to 69 years had some degree of hearing loss. Importantly, dif-
ficulty with hearing has been associated with poorer objec-
tive physical functioning in older adults and 31% increased risk
for disability,2 as well as poorer quality of life.3 The impaired
ability to effectively hear and communicate may further-
more result in negative emotional, cognitive, economic, and
social consequences and place individuals at safety risk. No-
tably, several studies have revealed substantial improvement
in the quality of life and physical functioning scores in pa-
tients with hearing loss following acoustic amplification.4-6
Thedecisiontoofferandprovidehearinglosspatientswith
hearing aids and cochlear implants depends on various clini-
cal factors, including age, degree and type of hearing loss, ana-
tomical considerations, and self-perceived difficulty with
communication.7 Rehabilitative options range from simple as-
sistive listening devices (ALDs) to hearing aids and cochlear
implants (CI). Despite the high prevalence of hearing loss,
gaps in the utilization of hearing aids and CIs have been pre-
viously identified. The rate of hearing aid usage among adults
who meet criteria and could benefit from amplification is es-
timated to be from 16% to 24.6%.8,9 Adult patients with hear-
ing difficulty may present to physicians from different spe-
cialties, including otolaryngology, internal medicine, family
medicine, or geriatrics. Although these patients are often re-
ferred to otolaryngologists and/or audiologists for further
evaluation, hearing screening and a discussion of the avail-
able therapeutic options could start in their initial encounter
with other clinicians. A regional study10 revealed that 26% of
primary care physicians were not aware that CIs can restore
hearing in deaf children and adults.
While much has been published regarding hearing loss in
patients who present to their physicians, few studies have fo-
cused on hearing status and function from the perspective of
the potential health care consumer in the general popula-
tion. In addition, patterns of referrals for further evaluation by
a specialist and hearing rehabilitation recommendations from
this perspective are also poorly described. In this study, we in-
vestigate the contemporary prevalence and characteristics of
self-reported hearing difficulty among adults in the United
States using the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). We
further analyzed the patterns of medical specialty referral,
evaluation, and amplification and CI recommendations for
adults with hearing difficulty.
Methods
The NHIS is a program designed and conducted by the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics. Since 1957, NHIS has col-
lected data on a broad range of health topics through per-
sonal household interviews of a statistically representative
sample of the US civilian noninstitutionalized population. An-
nually, approximately 35 000 to 40 000 households are inter-
viewed nationwide and data regarding approximately 75 000
to 100 000 individuals are collected. Survey instruments, pro-
cedures, variable definitions, and quality control processes are
documented elsewhere.11 The data sets contain deidentified
data, thus approval for this study by the institutional review
board was considered exempt from review. A data use agree-
ment was signed prior to obtaining the data.
The2014NHISdatasetwasqueriedandadultrecordswere
extracted. The records containing data for the hearing mod-
ule were included. Respondent demographics were ana-
lyzed. Hearing-related questions included self-reported hear-
ing status, difficulty in background noise, functional hearing
in a quiet room, hearing-related concerns, laterality of hear-
ing difficulty, age when first noticed hearing loss, and pri-
mary causes associated with the onset of hearing loss. In ad-
dition, data regarding hearing-related physician visits, referral
to hearing specialist, hearing testing, hearing aid use, and CIs
were analyzed. The survey contained primary and branching
questions. Therefore, the “universe” for the branching ques-
tions could vary with each “universe” defined as the subset
ofsurveysampleswhowereaskedasecondarybranchingques-
tion based on their response to a primary question. This was
accounted for and was outlined when reporting the results.
Each record had associated weight and strata data that ac-
countedforthecomplexclustereddesignofthesurveysample.
These variables allowed for extrapolating national estimates
and their respective standard errors (SEs). The SPSS statisti-
cal software package (version 22.0; SPSS, Inc) was used for all
data analyses. P<.05 was considered significant.
Results
Overall, 36 690 records were included in the analysis, which
extrapolated to an estimated (SE) 239.6 (2.5) million adults in
the United States. The mean (SD) age was 47 (0.2) years. Table 1
presents the demographics and prevalence and characteris-
tics of the self-reported hearing status. Women constituted an
estimated (SE) 51.8% (0.4%) of the population. Men were more
likely than women to report hearing difficulty (20.1% vs 13.8%,
respectively; absolute difference, 6.3%, 95% CI, 5.2%-7.4%).
Approximately 199.3 million (83.2%) indicated their hearing
status as “excellent” or “good,” whereas 40.3 million (16.8%)
Key Points
Question What are the epidemiologic features and treatment
patterns of hearing difficulty in the United States?
Findings Hearing difficulty is reported by 16.8% of the adult
population, and 1 in 5 adults with hearing difficulty had seen a
physician for hearing problems, of which one-third were referred
to a specialist. Among individuals who could not appreciate
shouting in a quiet room, 1 in 20 were recommended to have a
cochlear implant (CI), of which one-fifth had received one.
Meaning Although hearing difficulty remains a prevalent
condition nationally, considerable gaps exist in specialist referral
patterns and amplification and CI utilization.

 hadsomedegreeofhearingdifficultyfrom“alittletroublewith
the hearing” to being “deaf” (“less-than-good”). Hearing in
background noise was “never” or “seldom” a problem in 189.0
million (79.0%) while 50.3 million (21.0%) indicated having
problems from “about half the time” to “always.” As seen in
Table 1, about 147.4 million (62.1%) had never seen a clinician
for hearing problems and 117.4 million (49.7%) had never had
a hearing test performed. Approximately 48.8 million (20.6%)
had seen a physician for a hearing-related problem in the pre-
ceding 5 years. Of these, 15.9 million (32.6%) were referred to
an otolaryngologist and 13.3 million (27.3%) were referred to
an audiologist.
Functional hearing in a quiet room (Table 1) was defined/
reported as being able to hear “whispering” or “normal voice”
(225.4 million; 95.5%), able to only “hear shouting” (8.0 mil-
lion;3.4%),and“notappreciatingshouting”(2.8million;1.1%).
The division of the functional hearing status based on age de-
cades is presented in eTable 1 in the Supplement. Only 0.2 mil-
lion (5.3%) of the adults who “cannot appreciate shouting” in
a quiet room were recommended for a CI, of which 33 921
(22.1%) received one. Hearing aids were overall recom-
mended to 3.7 million (1.6%; SE, 0.1%) individuals. The rec-
ommendation rates based on the functional hearing status are
presented in Figure 1.
Table 2 presents data regarding the adults with “less-than-
good” hearing. Of these adults, 20.5 million (52.8%) indi-
cated poorer hearing in 1 ear (48.4% in right ear and 51.6% in
leftear).About15.7million(30.5%)statedfrustrationwiththeir
hearing from “about half the time” to “always,” and about 5.5
million (11.2%) indicated their hearing loss generated con-
cerns for their safety. The most common age brackets at first
hearing loss were 50 to 59 years (17.7%; SE, 0.7%) followed by
40 to 49 years (14.5%; SE, 0.6%) and 60 to 69 years (13.7%; SE,
0.5%) (Figure 2). Most individuals attributed their hearing dif-
ficulty to aging (31.4%) or long-term noise exposure (25.2%)
(eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Table3comparesthetreatmentpatternsoftheadultsbased
on their hearing status. As expected, individuals with “less-
than-good” hearing were more likely to be seen by a physi-
cian for hearing issues, most of which had a visit within the
preceding 5 years. These individuals were also more likely to
be referred to a hearing specialist or audiologist and undergo
hearing testing. Of the approximately 40.3 million adults with
“less-than-good” hearing, 32.2% had never seen a clinician for
hearing problems, 48.1% were never referred to a hearing spe-
cialist, 45.3% were never referred to an audiologist, and 28.0%
had never had their hearing tested.
Analysis of the hearing aid portion of the survey
revealed that an estimated (SE) 7.3 (0.3) million (3.1%; SE,
0.1%) reported using hearing aids at the time of the survey.
The duration of hearing aid use was less than 1 year in an

mated (SE) 4.6 (0.2) million (63.7%; SE, 2.0%).
Discussion
Hearing difficulty was reported by approximately 40 million
adults, equivalent to 16.8% of the national population.
Although in this study hearing difficulty was reported sub-
jectively, this rate closely matched the previously reported
16.1% prevalence of hearing loss based on the audiometric
data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
veys (NHANES) from 1999 to 2004.1 A more recent study12
using the NHANES data from 2011 to 2012 reported that the
prevalence of hearing loss had slightly decreased to 14.1%.
Nonetheless, hearing difficulty remains one of the most
prevalent chronic medical conditions in the United States.
Notably, of the 48.8 million (20.6%) who had seen a physi-
cian within the preceding 5 years for a hearing complaint,
32.6% were referred to an otolaryngologist and 27.3% were
referred to an audiologist, indicating that only a consider-
able minority of these patients are being referred to
advanced hearing care. With expertise in the evaluation of
hearing loss and in otologic diseases, otolaryngologists and
audiologists play a central role in the care of patients with
hearing difficulty. The otolaryngologists can best assess,
diagnose, and treat external, middle and inner ear disorders.
The audiologists can further characterize patient’
s hearing
type, perform audiologic evaluations, and help improve the
quality of life of hearing-impaired patients by fitting hearing
aids, if no medical or surgical treatments are available. With
improved patient and referring physician awareness, otolar-
yngologists can play a more prominent role in the care of
these patients and serve to optimize their otologic and reha-
bilitative outcomes.
Functional hearing was another important aspect of
audition investigated in the hearing module of the NHIS. Of
note, a considerable number of individuals reported an
inability to hear shouting in a quiet room (2.8 million; 1.1%).
Remarkably, only 5.3% of these adults received a recommen-
dation for a CI, and only 22.1% of those recommended had
received a CI. The lack of familiarity with CIs among physi-
cians may be a contributing factor to this low rate of CI rec-
ommendations. In a recent survey of the primary care physi-
cians in 2 southern California counties, almost 1 in 10
physicians were unfamiliar with CI as a treatment option for
hearing restoration.10 Approximately 80% were not aware
that CI was covered by all health plans and 26% were not
aware that CIs could potentially restore hearing for the deaf
and hearing impaired. In addition, inconsistent screening for
hearing loss in the primary care setting may result in the
underdiagnosis of hearing loss among adults. A household
survey found that only 14.6% of the physicians had per-
formed hearing screening (eg, tuning fork or whisper tests) in
their offices.9 As such, many candidates for hearing aids and
CIs may go unrecognized.13 The low rate of CIs in the current
study is consistent with the previous estimates of a 5% utili-
zation rate in the eligible adult population with severe to pro-
found hearing loss.14 A CI was performed in only 1 in 4 indi-
viduals who were recommended to receive one. Factors such

 as patient preference, socioeconomic status, and presence of
comorbid conditions may be contributing to this seemingly
low rate.
The number of individuals using hearing aids was esti-
mated to be approximately 7.3 million (3.1% of the US popu-
lation). According to the National Institute on Deafness and
Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), it is estimated that
about 28.8 million US adults could benefit from hearing aids,
but only 16.0% to 24.6% of the adults aged 20 to 69 years with
hearinglossandwhoarehearingaidcandidateshaveeverused
them.8,9 The low utilization rates of hearing aids has also been
attributedtoanumberoffactors,suchasdegreeofhearingloss,
self-recognition of hearing loss, financial limitations, and
stigma of wearing hearing devices.
Notably, approximately 50.3 million individuals
reported some degree of difficulty with hearing in back-
ground noise, which is considerably more than the number
of individuals with “less-than-good” hearing (40.2 million).
The difference could represent a subset of individuals with
excellent or good hearing who may suffer from mild or sub-
clinical degrees of noise-induced injury to the auditory
system,15 which has recently been described as a “hidden
hearing loss.” The phenomenon of hidden hearing loss has
been suggested to be a consequence of acute or chronic
noise trauma, resulting in irreversible damage to the hair
cell-neuron junction and eventual degeneration of the audi-
tory nerve.16-18 This paradigm has been proposed to be the
underlying pathophysiology for difficulty with speech
understanding in noisy environments in individuals with
normal or near-normal audiograms.19
Limitations
The limitations of this study must be considered for proper
interpretation of the findings. As with any other survey, the
accuracy of the responses was subject to entry and recall
bias. The collected data were subjective in nature and no
objective data, such as audiometric findings were available.
As such, the actual presence of hearing loss based on audi-
ometry could not be determined and no distinction between
conductive and sensorineural hearing loss could be made. In
addition, the definitions of responses such as “a little trouble
hearing” or “moderate trouble” could be subject to some
interpretation among the interviewees. Nonetheless, the
NHIS provides a unique opportunity to investigate the
nationwide prevalence of self-reported hearing difficulty
and treatment patterns using a representative sample taken
at the household level, rather than at the point-of-care level.
One of the important advantages of the NHIS is its focus on
the perspective of the patient and health care consumer,
which distinguishes it from other national surveys, such as
NHANES.20 Whereas these and other surveys allow for
analysis of data obtained at the point of health care delivery,
the NHIS enables investigators to assess how patients per-
ceive, manage, and seek care for their hearing difficulty
symptoms and to evaluate their resulting health care seeking
patterns and behavior.
The findings of the current study can serve to identify
the current gaps in the care of patients with hearing diffi-
culty. Increasing awareness of amplification and CI options
among physicians and improving access to hearing evalua-
tions and specialists may improve the clinical care of those
with hearing loss. Future studies are warranted to further
investigate the observed trends of this study.
Conclusions
Hearing difficulty is self-reported by about 16.8% of the adults
in the United States. About 20.6% of adults with “less-than-
good” hearing had seen a physician for hearing problems in
the preceding 5 years. Only a minority of these patients were
referred to an otolaryngologist or audiologist. Among indi-
viduals who could not appreciate “shouting across a quiet
room,” only 5.3% were recommended to have a CI, of which
only 22.1% had received one. Of the adults with “less-than-
good” hearing, 32.2% had never seen a physician for hearing
problems and 28.0% had never had their hearing tested. In-
creased awareness among clinicians regarding the burden of
hearing loss, the importance of early detection and appropri-
ate work-up of hearing loss, and available amplification and
CI options can contribute to improved care for individuals with
hearing difficulty.
