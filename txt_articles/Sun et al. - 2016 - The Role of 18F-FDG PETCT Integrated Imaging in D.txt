Abstract
Objective
The aim of our study was to evaluate the role of 18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging in dif-
ferentiating malignant from benign pleural effusion.
Methods
A total of 176 patients with pleural effusion who underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT examination
to differentiate malignancy from benignancy were retrospectively researched. The images
of CT imaging, 18F-FDG PET imaging and 18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging were visu-
ally analyzed. The suspected malignant effusion was characterized by the presence of nod-
ular or irregular pleural thickening on CT imaging. Whereas on PET imaging, pleural 18F-
FDG uptake higher than mediastinal activity was interpreted as malignant effusion. Images
of 18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging were interpreted by combining the morphologic fea-
ture of pleura on CT imaging with the degree and form of pleural 18F-FDG uptake on PET
imaging.
Results
One hundred and eight patients had malignant effusion, including 86 with pleural metastasis
and 22 with pleural mesothelioma, whereas 68 patients had benign effusion. The sensitivi-
ties of CT imaging, 18F-FDG PET imaging and 18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging in
detecting malignant effusion were 75.0%, 91.7% and 93.5%, respectively, which were
69.8%, 91.9% and 93.0% in distinguishing metastatic effusion. The sensitivity of 18F-FDG
PET/CT integrated imaging in detecting malignant effusion was higher than that of CT imag-
ing (p = 0.000). For metastatic effusion, 18F-FDG PET imaging had higher sensitivity (p =
0.000) and better diagnostic consistency with 18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging com-
pared with CT imaging (Kappa = 0.917 and Kappa = 0.295, respectively). The specificities
of CT imaging, 18F-FDG PET imaging and 18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging were

 94.1%, 63.2% and 92.6% in detecting benign effusion. The specificities of CT imaging and
18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging were higher than that of 18F-FDG PET imaging (p =
0.000 and p = 0.000, respectively), and CT imaging had better diagnostic consistency with
18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging compared with 18F-FDG PET imaging (Kappa = 0.881
and Kappa = 0.240, respectively).
Conclusion
18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging is a more reliable modality in distinguishing malignant
from benign pleural effusion than 18F-FDG PET imaging and CT imaging alone. For image
interpretation of 18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging, the PET and CT portions play a
major diagnostic role in identifying metastatic effusion and benign effusion, respectively.
Introduction
Pleural effusion caused by a number of malignant and benign diseases is a common and chal-
lenging medical problem. In clinic, a series of diagnostic assessments are of great importance
for the rational treatment. Above all, differential diagnosis that distinguishes malignant from
benign pleural effusion is the first problem which has to be solved. Computed tomography
(CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) as noninvasive methods have been used in
characterizing pleural effusion as malignancy or benignancy, and can trigger the determination
of etiology in some cases [1,2]. PET/CT scanner combining in-line PET and CT cameras pro-
vides functional and anatomic/morphologic imagings, and is a new device with considerable
diagnostic potential [3]. Several studies have been implemented to discuss the role of PET/CT
using 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) in assessing the nature of pleural effusion
[4,5,6,7,8]. However, their purposes were to evaluate a series of parameters such as density of
the effusion, morphology of any solid pleural abnormality and increased uptake of 18F-FDG in
pleural effusion and pleura, and the solid pleural abnormality and pleural uptake were signifi-
cant parameters used for differentiation [4,5]. However, their results were displayed in the
form of 18F-FDG PET or CT alone. So far, the method that integrates pleural abnormality on
PET imaging with that on CT imaging in the differential diagnosis of pleural effusion has not
been explored. We performed this study to determine whether 18F-FDG PET/CT integrated
imaging could effectively distinguish malignant from benign pleural effusion. In addition, the
diagnostic role of CT and PET portions from 18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging remains to
be inexplicit, when interpreting the diagnostic results of 18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging.
Thus, the other purpose of the current study was to investigate the diagnostic role of CT and
PET portions from 18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging in the differential diagnosis of pleural
effusion.
Materials and Methods
Patient selection
We conducted a retrospective study of patients with pleural effusion from June 2005 to May
2013, who underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT examination to differentiate malignancy from benig-
nancy. Patients enrolled in the present study met the following inclusion criteria. The definitive
pathologic diagnosis of malignant pleural effusion was confirmed by thoracocentesis, pleural
sample from needle biopsy, thoracoscope or thoracotomy performed within 4 weeks after

 18F-FDG PET/CT examination. None of enrolled patients with malignant pleural effusion had
received induction chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy before 18F-FDG PET/CT examina-
tion. Benign pleural effusion was concluded by thoracoscope, thoracotomy or clinical findings.
On the basis of clinical findings, benign pleural effusion was confirmed if ⑴ at least 2 cytologic
results were negative for malignancy, and ⑵ there were clinical findings of a disease such as
inflammatory pleural effusion, tuberculous pleural effusion, and transudate caused by conges-
tive heart failure, renal insufficiency, or hepatic cirrhosis, and ⑶ pleural effusion disappeared
after symptomatic treatment and clinical follow-up was over 12 months. Finally, a total of 176
patients with pleural effusion (108 men and 68 women; age range, 35–92 years; mean age ± SD,
60 ± 12 years) were enrolled in the study. The present study was approved by Institutional
Research Board of Harbin Medical University.
PET/CT scanning
All patients involved in the study were required to fast for 4~6 hours before subjecting to
whole-body 18F-FDG PET/CT examination (Discovery ST; General Electric Medical System).
Blood glucose level of all patients was lower than 7 mmol/L before receiving the tracer. The
average dosage of 18F-FDG was from 4 to 5 MBq/Kg of body weight. After 18F-FDG injection,
the patients were required to keep supine for 60 min in a quiet room without being disturbed.
The scanning range was from head to proximal thigh. The CT scanning was performed with
120 kV, 150 mA, 0.8 seconds per CT rotation and 3.75mm slice thickness. PET scanning was
performed with the same position in the 2-dimensional mode. The emission scan time was 2.5
min per bed position, and 6–7 bed positions were generally taken for all patients. Attenuation
correction for PET was based on the CT data. Transaxial, sagittal, and coronal images were
analyzed on computer workstation (Xeleris; General Electric Medical System).
Interpretation of imaging
The images from all patients with pleural effusion were reviewed by two experienced physi-
cians in PET/CT who were unaware of the results of pathology and follow-up, and the final
results of image assessment were based on the consensus reading. On computer workstation,
the nature of pleural effusion was assessed on the basis of the pleural abnormality.
Concerning CT image interpretation, the suspected malignant pleural effusion was based
on the presence of at least one criterion for malignant pleural thickening reported by Traill (1):
nodular or focal pleural thickening, and irregular pleural thickening. In contrast, pleural effu-
sion with no pleural thickening or diffuse smooth thickening was regarded as benign disease.
Images of 18F-FDG PET were analyzed by visual interpretation. In brief, the degree of
18F-FDG uptake in pleural region was compared with background mediastinal activity. Any
pleural lesion with increased 18F-FDG uptake higher than mediastinal activity was interpreted
as malignant pleural effusion. 18F-FDG PET suggested negative result if pleural activity was
equal to or less than mediastinal activity. Meanwhile, the biodistribution pattern of positive
pleural activity was defined as diffuse, nodular and multiple nodular lesion, and the maximal
standardized uptake values (SUVmax) were calculated by overlaying region of interest (ROI)
onto positive pleura.
18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging was interpreted by combining the morphologic fea-
ture of the pleura on CT imaging with the degree and form of pleural 18F-FDG uptake on PET
imaging. The first step was to determine whether there was a suspicious extrapleural primary
malignancy. Afterwards, image interpretation was based on the diagnostic criteria showed in
Fig 1.

 Statistical analysis
The diagnostic results of CT imaging, 18F-FDG PET imaging and 18F-FDG PET/CT integrated
imaging were compared with pathology and clinical findings, and the sensitivities and specifici-
ties of three imagings were evaluated. SPSS 16.0 software package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois,
USA) was used in this study. (1) McNemar test was used to compare the differences between
the sensitivity and specificity of 18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging and those of CT imaging
and 18F-FDG PET imaging alone to investigate whether 18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging
could more effectively separate pleural effusion into malignancy and benignancy. A p value of
less than 0.05 was considered to be statistical significant. (2) To survey the diagnostic role of
CT and PET portions from 18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging in the antidiastole of pleural
effusion, the sensitivity and specificity of 18F-FDG PET imaging were compared with those of
CT imaging alone using McNemar test, and Measure of Agreement Kappa was applied to test
the diagnostic consistency between CT imaging and 18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging, and
that between 18F-FDG PET imaging and 18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging. The weighted
Kappa value for the degree of agreement was acquired, and higher Kappa value represented
better consistency, suggesting better diagnostic role.

 exploratory thoracotomy (n = 3). Primary tumors were as follows: pleural mesothelioma
(n = 22), lung cancer (n = 77), ovarian cancer (n = 4), pancreatic cancer (n = 3), renal carci-
noma (n = 1), and hepatocarcinoma (n = 1). The other 68 patients had benign pleural effusion,
including tuberculous pleural effusion (n = 30), inflammatory effusion (n = 26), hepatic cirrho-
sis (n = 2), cardiogenic effusion (n = 8), and renal origin (n = 2), which were confirmed by
thoracoscope (n = 5), thoracotomy (n = 4), needle biopsy (n = 3) or clinical examinations
(n = 56).
Diagnostic role of CT imaging, PET imaging and PET/CT integrated
imaging in evaluating malignant pleural effusion
Eighty one patients were diagnosed as malignant pleural effusion on CT imaging, including
21 cases of pleural mesothelioma and 60 cases of pleural metastasis. However, the other 27
patients with malignant pleural effusion caused by 1 case of pleural mesothelioma and 26 cases
of pleural metastasis were misdiagnosed as benignancy. The sensitivity of CT imaging in
detecting malignant pleural effusion was 75.0% (81/108), and the sensitivities of CT imaging in
detecting malignant pleural effusion caused by pleural mesothelioma and pleural metastasis
were 95.5% (21/22) and 69.8% (60/86), respectively.
Based on 18F-FDG PET findings, 99 patients with malignant effusion caused by 20 cases of
pleural mesothelioma and 79 cases of pleural metastasis were correctly identified in terms of
increased pleural 18F-FDG uptake with SUVmax of 5.9±2.8 (range 2.2 to 15.3). The biodistri-
bution pattern of 18F-FDG included 80 cases of diffuse uptake, 8 cases of nodular distribution
and 11 cases of multiple nodular uptake. While 9 patients with malignant effusion (2 had pleu-
ral mesothelioma and 7 had pleural metastasis) were read to be negative due to low pleural
uptake. The sensitivity of 18F-FDG PET imaging in detecting malignant pleural effusion was
91.7% (99/108), and the sensitivities of 18F-FDG PET imaging in detecting pleural effusion
caused by pleural mesothelioma and pleural metastasis were 90.9% (20/22) and 91.9% (79/86),
respectively.
18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging correctly detected the presence of malignant pleural
effusion in 101 patients, including 21 cases of pleural mesothelioma and 80 cases of pleural
metastasis. In these patients, PET and CT imagings simultaneously supported malignant pleu-
ral effusion in 20 cases of pleural mesothelioma and 59 cases of pleural metastasis. However,
CT imaging displayed malignant pleural effusion in 1 case of pleural mesothelioma and 1 case
of pleural metastasis with negative findings on PET imaging, while 20 patients with malignant
pleural effusion caused by pleural metastasis were diagnosed as malignancy on PET imaging
with negative findings on CT imaging (Fig 2). The remaining patients with malignant pleural
effusion (1 pleural mesothelioma and 6 pleural metastasis) were falsely evaluated on 18F-FDG
PET/CT integrated imaging. The sensitivity of 18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging in detect-
ing malignant pleural effusion was 93.5% (101/108), and the sensitivities of 18F-FDG PET/CT
integrated imaging in detecting pleural effusion caused by pleural mesothelioma and pleural
metastasis were 95.5% (21/22) and 93.0% (80/86), respectively.
As shown in Table 1, the sensitivities of both 18F-FDG PET imaging and 18F-FDG PET/CT
integrated imaging in detecting malignant pleural effusion were higher than that of CT imaging
alone (p = 0.000 and p = 0.000, respectively). Further classification analysis displayed that there
was no statistical difference among the sensitivities of CT, 18F-FDG PET and 18F-FDG PET/CT
integrated imaging in distinguishing malignant effusion caused by pleural mesothelioma
(p = 1.000, p = 1.000 and p = 1.000, respectively), and the diagnostic consistency between CT
imaging and 18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging was better than that between 18F-FDG
PET imaging and 18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging (Kappa = 1.000 and Kappa = 0.645,

 respectively). While for metastatic pleural effusion, the sensitivities of 18F-FDG PET imaging
and 18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging were higher than that of CT imaging (p = 0.000 and
p = 0.000, respectively), and the diagnostic consistency between 18F-FDG PET imaging and
18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging was obviously superior to that between CT imaging and
18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging (Kappa = 0.917 and Kappa = 0.295, respectively).
Diagnostic role of CT imaging, PET imaging and PET/CT integrated
imaging in distinguishing benign pleural effusion
Of 68 patients with benign pleural effusion, 64 were correctly identified according to CT imag-
ing alone, which resulted in a specificity of 94.1%. 18F-FDG PET imaging correctly character-
ized 43 patients for the absence of 18F-FDG uptake within the pleura, while 8 cases of

CT (C, arrow) display nodular 18F-FDG uptake (SUVmax of 3.0) in left-posterior pleural region. Pathology from thoracentesis
confirmed malignant pleural effusion caused by metastatic adenocarcinoma.

 inflammatory effusion and 17 cases of tuberculous pleural effusion were mistakenly considered
to be malignant due to high pleural 18F-FDG uptake. SUVmax of positive pleura was 5.4±2.0
(range 2.2 to 11.8). This resulted in a specificity of 63.2% (43/68) on 18F-FDG PET imaging in
distinguishing benign pleural effusion.
18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging correctly assessed benign pleural effusion in 63
patients. Among these patients, 43 were simultaneously regarded as benignancy on both CT
and PET imagings, while 8 cases of inflammatory effusion and 12 cases of tuberculous pleural
effusion showing false-positive findings on 18F-FDG PET imaging were interpreted to be
benign by means of combining morphologic manifestation of CT imaging with no sign of
malignancy (Fig 3). Four patients with tuberculous pleural effusion were regarded as malig-
nancy in view of malignant signs on both CT and PET imagings. The remaining 1 patient with
tuberculous pleural effusion was interpreted as malignancy due to multiple nodular 18F-FDG
uptake of pleura with negative finding on CT imaging. The specificity of 18F-FDG PET/CT
integrated imaging in detecting benign pleural effusion was 92.6% (63/68).
There was no pleural thickening on CT imaging and no pleural 18F-FDG uptake on PET
imaging in 12 patients with pleural effusion caused by the dysfunction of liver, heart and kid-
ney. Of 26 patients with inflammatory effusion, 7 had encapsulated effusion and 19 had free
pleural effusion. Five out of these patients with encapsulated effusion showed diffuse 18F-FDG
retention in the pleura encompassing effusion, and 3 of 19 patients with free pleural effusion
had diffuse 18F-FDG uptake of the pleura on PET imaging. In these patients with pleural
18F-FDG uptake, light smooth thickening of the pleura was displayed on the corresponding
region of CT imaging.
For 30 patients with tuberculous pleural effusion, 3 showed encapsulated effusion and 27
displayed free effusion. Pleural 18F-FDG retention on PET imaging was present in 17 patients,
including 13 with diffuse 18F-FDG uptake, 2 with diffuse 18F-FDG uptake at costodiaphrag-
matic recesses, 1 with nodular 18F-FDG uptake in pleural reflection and 1 with multiple nodu-
lar 18F-FDG uptake. The detailed image features of CT and PET imagings of tuberculous
pleural effusions are showed in Table 2.
The specificities of CT imaging and 18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging were higher than
that of 18F-FDG PET imaging (p = 0.000 and p = 0.000, respectively). There was no statistical
difference of specificity between CT imaging and 18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging
(p = 1.000). The diagnostic consistency between CT imaging and 18F-FDG PET/CT integrated

Discussion
18F-FDG PET/CT imaging as a method of differential diagnosis has been reported to distin-
guish malignant from benign pleural effusion [4,5,6,7], and the presences of pleural abnormal-
ity on CT imaging and pleural region uptake on 18F-FDG PET imaging are found to be the
most accurate criteria in determining the malignant nature of pleural effusion [4,5]. However,
the efficacy of 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging are displayed in the form of 18F-FDG PET and CT
alone. For instance, Toaff et al. [4] reported a 18F-FDG PET/CT study of 31 patients with pri-
mary extrapleural malignancy and pleural effusion, and found that the sensitivities of pleural

 uptake on PET imaging and pleural lesion on CT imaging were 86% and 71%, respectively, and
the specificity was 90% for both of the 2 parameters. Kim et al. [5] reported that the sensitivity
and specificity of 18F-FDG PET imaging was 87.5% and 88.8%, respectively, and the respective
sensitivity and specificity of CT imaging was 83.3% and 88.8%. The difference of the present
study from previous studies was the method for image interpretation of 18F-FDG PET/CT
imaging in identifying the nature of pleural effusion, and the diagnosis results of 18F-FDG
PET/CT imaging were determined by synthesizing the degree and form of pleural 18F-FDG
uptake on PET imaging and pleural morphologic manifestation on CT imaging. By this means,
we found that 18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging with sensitivity of 93.5% and specificity of
92.6% showed superior sensitivity to CT imaging alone and higher specificity than PET imag-
ing alone, respectively. The work presented here demonstrated that 18F-FDG PET/CT inte-
grated imaging was a more reliable diagnostic method than 18F-FDG PET and CT imagings in
the differential diagnosis of pleural effusion.
The present study also investigated the diagnostic role of CT and PET portions from
18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging in the antidiastole of pleural effusion. In our study,
malignant effusion was divided into the groups of pleural mesothelioma and metastatic pleu-
risy in the light of primary cause. In detecting malignant effusion caused by pleural mesotheli-
oma, CT imaging and 18F-FDG PET imaging had relatively high sensitivity. Moreover, CT
imaging had better diagnostic consistency with 18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging than PET
imaging. These findings suggest that CT portion from 18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging
played a major role in distinguishing malignant effusion caused by pleural mesothelioma.
In contrast to pleural effusion caused by mesothelioma, metastatic pleural effusion has
higher morbidity. CT imaging can detect subtle pleural metastases without or with a small
amount of associated pleural effusion [9], and thin-section CT imaging provides more useful
information than thick-section CT imaging for the evaluation of pleural dissemination with
sensitivity of 90% [10]. However, in this study, the morphologic imaging on unenhanced CT
imaging alone could not effectively distinguish metastatic pleural effusion with sensitivity of
69.8%. This implies that pleural effusion is the dominant factor that affects CT imaging to
detect pleural metastases. 18F-FDG PET imaging, revealing metabolic activity of disease rather
than its morphologic structure, is not affectted by pleural effusion and can play a significant
role in lung cancer patients with pleural effusion and normal or equivocal involvement of pleu-
ral surface on CT imaging [2,11]. A previous study showed that the sensitivity of 18F-FDG PET
imaging in identifying pleural involvement in patients with pleural effusion and extrapleural

 malignancy, including lung cancer, lymphoma, melanoma and ovarian cancer, was greater
than that of CT imaging alone [4]. This was consistent with our results, although the types of
primary tumor in this study were different from previous researches. Meanwhile, 18F-FDG
PET imaging had higher diagnostic consistency with 18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging
compared with CT imaging. Therefore, when 18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging was used
to indentify the nature of pleural effusion, we mainly taked advantage of the ability of 18F-FDG
PET portion to detect pleural metastases.
18F-FDG PET imaging has been reported to possess limited specificity in differentiating
malignant from benign pleural effusion [6]. Low specificity of 18F-FDG PET imaging associ-
ated with the pleural false-positive findings caused by benign diseases, similar to changes seen
on malignancy, is never effectively resolved, which results in more unnecessary invasive exami-
nations such as thoracoscope, thoracocentesis and needle biopsy of pleura. Some studies have
previously focused on the diagnostic effect of PET imaging and the exact anatomic location
of CT imaging, when interpreting diagnosis results of 18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging
[8,12]. However, based on our experience, the diagnostic role of CT imaging to the manage-
ment of pleural effusion should’t be neglected, and the CT portion from 18F-FDG PET/CT
integrated imaging played a major diagnostic role in identifying benign pleural effusion. The
results of our study showed that CT imaging had higher specificity and better diagnostic con-
sistency with 18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging compared with 18F-FDG PET imaging. In
interpreting images of 18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging, CT imaging could be used to cor-
rect the false-positive findings on PET imaging and enhance the diagnosis specificity with the
sensitivity not being reduced. Eight cases of inflammatory effusion and 12 cases of tuberculous
pleural effusion with false-positive findings on 18F-FDG PET imaging were finally diagnosed as
benign disorder because the malignant diagnosis was not accepted on CT imaging.
For inflammatory effusion, there was a tendency that increased pleural 18F-FDG uptake was
more easily found in encapsulated pleural effusion (5/7) compared with free pleural effusion
(3/19). This may be ascribed to more serious inflammatory reaction of the pleura encompass-
ing encapsulated effusion. However, the pleura with false-positive findings on PET imaging
displayed diffuse 18F-FDG uptake accompany with light smooth thickening of the correspond-
ing region on CT imaging.
It is common that false positivity on PET imaging is caused by tuberculous disease
[13,14,15]. Orki et al. [8] reported that patients with tuberculous pleuritis could have region of
increased 18F-FDG uptake in the pleura. In this study, 56.7% (17/30) of tuberculous pleural
effusion showed false-positive findings on PET imaging, most of which displayed diffuse
18F-FDG uptake in the pleural region.
Several limitations probably influenced this study. Firstly, in the study, unenhanced CT was
used to evaluate the nature of pleural effusion. However, contrast-enhanced CT is superior to
unenhanced CT in differentiating pleural thickening from effusion. So, this may affect the role
of CT in identifying malignant pleural effusion. Secondly, the differential diagnosis of pleural
effusion in the present study was performed on the basis of the pleural abnormality. However,
the 18F-FDG uptake degree of effusion may be useful in evaluating the nature of pleural effu-
sion. Because cast-off cells of tumor in effusion also cause 18F-FDG uptake, which may be dif-
ferent from benign pleural effusion.
Conclusion
In differentiating malignant from benign pleural effusion, 18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imag-
ing is a more useful modality than 18F-FDG PET imaging and CT imaging alone. When inter-
preting images of 18F-FDG PET/CT integrated imaging, the PET and CT portions play a major

 role in detecting metastatic effusion and benign effusion, respectively. CT imaging can be used
to correct the false-positive findings on PET imaging and improve the specificity with the sen-
sitivity not being reduced.
