IMPORTANCE Misperceptions about prognosis by individuals making decisions for
incapacitated critically ill patients (surrogates) are common and often attributed to poor
comprehension of medical information.
OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence of and factors related to physician-surrogate
discordance about prognosis in intensive care units (ICUs).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Mixed-methods study comprising quantitative surveys
and qualitative interviews conducted in 4 ICUs at a major US medical center involving
surrogate decision makers and physicians caring for patients at high risk of death from
January 4, 2005, to July 10, 2009.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Discordance about prognosis, defined as a difference
between a physician’
s and a surrogate’
s prognostic estimates of at least 20%;
misunderstandings by surrogates (defined as any difference between a physician’
s prognostic
estimate and a surrogate’
s best guess of that estimate); differences in belief (any difference
between a surrogate’
s actual estimate and their best guess of the physician’
s estimate).
RESULTS Two hundred twenty-nine surrogate decision makers (median age, 47 [interquartile
range {IQR}, 35-56] years; 68% women) and 99 physicians were involved in the care of 174
critically ill patients (median age, 60 [IQR, 47-74] years; 44% women). Physician-surrogate
discordance about prognosis occurred in 122 of 229 instances (53%; 95% CI, 46.8%-59.7%).
In 65 instances (28%), discordance was related to both misunderstandings by surrogates and
differences in belief about the patient’
s prognosis; 38 (17%) were related to
misunderstandings by surrogates only; 7 (3%) were related to differences in belief only; and
data were missing for 12. Seventy-five patients (43%) died. Surrogates’prognostic estimates
were much more accurate than chance alone, but physicians’prognostic estimates were
statistically significantly more accurate than surrogates’(C statistic, 0.83 vs 0.74; absolute
difference, 0.094; 95% CI, 0.024-0.163; P = .008). Among 71 surrogates interviewed who
had beliefs about the prognosis that were more optimistic than that of the physician, the
most common reasons for optimism were a need to maintain hope to benefit the patient
(n = 34), a belief that the patient had unique strengths unknown to the physician (n = 24),
and religious belief (n = 19).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among critically ill patients, discordant expectations about
prognosis were common between patients’physicians and surrogate decision makers and
were related to misunderstandings by surrogates about physicians’assessments of patients’
prognoses and differences in beliefs about patients’prognoses.

I
n 2010, it was estimated that nearly half of US adults
near the end of life were unable to make decisions for
themselves about whether to accept life-prolonging
technologies.1 Family members or other individuals are
asked to serve as surrogate decision makers for these often
difficult decisions. To effectively function in this role, surro-
gates require a clear understanding of the likely outcomes of
treatment. Numerous studies over the last 3 decades indi-
cate that surrogates of patients with advanced illness often
have optimistic expectations about prognosis.2-4 This is
problematic because optimistic expectations are associated
with more use of invasive treatments in dying patients
and delayed integration of palliative care.5-7 Clinicians cite
unrealistic expectations by surrogates as one of the most
important barriers to high-quality end-of-life care in seri-
ously ill patients.8
Although misperceptions about prognosis by surrogates
are well documented, an important barrier to progress is the
lack of a clear understanding of the causes of these misper-
ceptions. The conventional assumption is that surrogates’
inaccurate expectations arise from misunderstandings of
physicians’assessments of prognosis.3,9 However, insights
from decision psychology suggest that other mechanisms
may plausibly influence individuals’risk perceptions, such
as optimism biases and alternative value systems that lead
surrogates to have beliefs about prognosis that differ from
physicians’
. Several small qualitative and simulation-based
studies among surrogates in intensive care units (ICUs) sug-
gest that such considerations may contribute to physician-
surrogate discordance about prognosis,7,10-12 but these
hypotheses have not been empirically validated in surro-
gates making actual decisions for incapacitated patients.
Without clarity about factors that contribute to discordance,
it will be difficult to design interventions targeting the key
barriers to effective conversations about prognosis.
Wethereforesoughttoquantitativelydeterminethepreva-
lence of physician-surrogate discordance about prognosis and
to qualitatively understand reasons that surrogates some-
times hold beliefs about prognosis that differ from physi-
cians’assessments.
Methods
We conducted a study combining quantitative measurement
of physicians’and surrogates’perceptions of prognosis with
qualitative interviews (“mixed methods”) to explore what fac-
tors were related to surrogates’perceptions of patient prog-
nosis. We enrolled surrogate decision makers for incapaci-
tated patients at high risk of death in 4 ICUs at the University
of California, San Francisco Medical Center from January 4,
2005, to July 10, 2009. The ICUs included 2 medical-surgical
ICUs, a neurological ICU, and a cardiac ICU. Patients were eli-
gible if they were aged 18 years or older, lacked decision-
making capacity on day 5 of their ICU stay, had respiratory fail-
ure requiring mechanical ventilation, and had an Acute
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score
of 25 or higher, which predicts a roughly 40% risk of in-
hospital mortality.13 Patients were excluded if they were await-
ing organ transplantation or if they lacked a surrogate deci-
sion maker.
After obtaining permission from patients’ attending
physicians, research staff approached the patients’surro-
gates about study participation. If the responsibility for sur-
rogate decision making was shared between multiple indi-
viduals, we enrolled those who self-reported having a
significant amount of responsibility for decision making.
Thus, more than 1 surrogate per patient could be enrolled.
All participating surrogates and physicians provided written
informed consent; surrogates provided proxy written con-
sent for incapacitated patients. The institutional review
board approved all study procedures.
Study Procedures
On a patient’
s fifth day of receiving mechanical ventilation,
physicians estimated the likelihood that the patient would
survive the hospitalization using a previously validated
question and a 0% to 100% scale: “What do you think are
the chances that the patient will survive this hospitalization
if the current plan of care stays the same?”10,14,15 Within 1
hour, surrogates independently answered the same ques-
tion on the same 0% to 100% probability scale, blinded to
the physician’
s response. The study did not mandate or
facilitate physician-surrogate conversations about prognosis
prior to asking these questions, but the near simultaneity of
measures minimized the possibility that changes in a
patient’
s condition could contribute to differences in
physician-surrogate estimates. Surrogates were also asked
to record what they perceived to be the physician’
s assess-
ment of prognosis with the question “If you had to guess,
what do you think the doctor thinks is the chance that your
loved one will survive this hospitalization if the current plan
of care stays the same?” A standard probability scale was
used to record participants’prognostic estimates, with the
anchors comprising simple expressions of risk (“0% chance
of survival”; “100% chance of survival”) to minimize the
chance of response errors among study participants with
limited numeracy (Figure 1).16-18 Race and ethnicity infor-
mation was collected by self-report from participants. The
eAppendix in the Supplement contains a description of
other covariates included in the questionnaire.
Semistructured Interviews
An interviewer blinded to physicians’prognostic estimates
conducted one-on-one, semistructured interviews with sur-
rogates immediately after they completed the questionnaire.
The interviewer showed each participant his/her responses
to the 2 questions about prognosis (ie, “What do you think
are the chances that your loved one will survive …?” and
“What do you think the doctor thinks are the chances that the
patient will survive …?”). Next, the interviewer read the fol-
lowing standardized prompt: “Please take a moment to look
at your responses. I notice that what you think is the patient’
s
prognosis [differs from/is the same as] what you think the
physician thinks is the prognosis. Can you tell me a little bit
about this?” The interviewer used techniques of cognitive

interviewing19 and standardized probes to pursue and clarify
emergent themes as they arose. The content of the semistruc-
tured interview was expanded over time to pursue and clarify
themes that emerged in prior interviews.19-21
Quantitative Analyses
We defined physician-surrogate discordance about progno-
sis as at least a 20% difference between the physician’
s and
surrogate’
s prognostic estimates based on a modified time–
trade-off experiment in patients with serious illness in
which patients’willingness to receive ongoing life support
declined substantially when their prognosis worsened by
20%.22 We categorized surrogates’estimates as discordant
pessimistic (prognostic estimate at least 20% lower than
physician’
s) or discordant optimistic (prognostic estimate at
least 20% higher than physician’
s) Among cases with
physician-surrogate discordance about prognosis, we quan-
tified the proportion due to misunderstandings by surro-
gates (any difference between the physician’
s prognostic
estimate and the surrogate’
s best guess about that estimate)
and the proportion due to differences in belief (any differ-
ence between the surrogate’
s prognostic estimate and their
best guess about the physician’
s estimate) (Figure 1).
We reviewed the medical record to determine hospital
survival and compared the accuracy of physicians’and sur-
rogates’prognostic estimates by comparing the area under
the receiver operating characteristic curves generated using
mixed-effects regression models with patients nested
within surrogates within physicians, patient mortality as a
dependent variable, surrogate and physician survival esti-
mates as independent variables, and physician as a random
intercept (see the eAppendix in the Supplement for addi-
tional details).23 We used Stata version 14.0 (Stata Corp) for
all quantitative analyses and considered as statistically sig-
nificant a 2-sided α<.05.
We estimated that a sample size of 229 surrogates would
be required to detect a prevalence of physician-surrogate dis-
cordance of 50% (based on the prevalence observed in a prior
study in France2,24) with a confidence interval range (upper
to lower bound) of less than 15%, assuming statistical power
of 80% and a 2-sided α = .05.
Qualitative Analyses
A medical transcriptionist transcribed the audiorecorded in-
terviews verbatim. We used constant comparative methods to
inductively develop a framework to describe participants’rea-
sons for the congruence or incongruence of their prognostic
estimates with what they believed to be the physician’
s prog-
nostic estimates. Constant comparative methods are a gen-
eral method for inductively analyzing systematically gath-
ered qualitative data. The method is most useful when existing
conceptual frameworks for the topics under study are
inadequate.19-21
To develop the preliminary coding scheme, 4 investiga-
tors independently coded a subset of transcripts line by
line. As themes and concepts accumulated, we refined dis-
tinctions between concepts and grouped similar concepts
into conceptual categories. These categories were devel-
oped further by comparing transcripts. Through a series of
meetings, investigators arrived at consensus on the final
coding framework (see the eAppendix in the Supplement
for additional details).
Two investigators blinded to participants’demographic
characteristics and each other’
s work listened to the audio-
tapes, read the transcripts, and coded all interviews using
the final coding framework. The mean κ statistic based on a
random sample of 20% of interviews was 0.86 (range, 0.71-
1.00), indicating excellent interrater reliability.25 All discrep-
ancies between coders were reviewed and resolved through
dialogue between the coders and the first author.

patient’
s chances of survival to hospital discharge in response to the question
“What do you think are the chances that the patient/your loved one will survive
this hospitalization if the current plan of care stays the same?” Surrogates also
recorded their perceptions of the physician’
s prognostic estimate (B). Not all
surrogates and physicians reported that a conversation about prognosis had
occurred and therefore, some surrogates had no explicit prognostic information
from physicians on which to base their estimates. Physician-surrogate
discordance was defined as physician-surrogate differences of at least 20%
(difference between A and C). Differences of any magnitude between
the surrogate’
s prognostic estimate (C) and the surrogate’
s perceptions
of the physician’
s prognostic estimate (B) were classified as differences
in belief. Differences of any magnitude between the physician’
s prognostic
estimate (A) and the surrogate’
s perceptions of the physician’
s prognostic
estimate (B) were classified as surrogate misunderstandings.

To ensure coding validity,26,27 we used a multidisci-
plinary approach in developing the framework, which
reduced the chance that individual bias threatened the
validity of the findings, and we presented the preliminary
findings to a sample of study participants for confirmation
and/or modification, a process known as member checking.
There was strong support for the framework among partici-
pants and no new themes were raised during the process of
member checking.
Results
Patient and Participant Characteristics
Of 222 eligible physician-patient dyads, 174 (79%) agreed to
participate; 20 (9%) attending physicians and 27 (12%) fami-
lies declined to participate. There were no important differ-
ences between enrolled and nonenrolled patients in demo-
graphic characteristics, admission diagnosis, or severity of
illness. Forty patients had more than 1 surrogate (median
number of surrogates, 1 [interquartile range {IQR}, 1-1; range,
1-5] per family). Restricting the analyses to 1 surrogate per
patient did not change the findings; therefore, we report data
from all surrogates.
Demographic characteristics of the patients, surrogate de-
cision makers, and physicians are shown in Table 1, Table 2,
and Table 3, respectively. The sample was diverse in terms of
sex, race, ethnicity, religious affiliation, and level of educa-
tion. At enrollment, patients had a median APACHE II score of
28 (IQR, 26-32) and 75 patients (43%) died in the hospital. The
mediantimebetweensurrogateparticipationandpatientdeath
was 7 days (IQR, 3-21 days). A conversation about prognosis
by day 5 of mechanical ventilation was reported by 183 surro-
gates (80%), 199 physicians (87%), and 213 (93%) of either.
Physician-Surrogate Discordance
Physician-surrogate discordance about prognosis occurred in
122 of 229 instances (53%; 95% CI, 46.8%-59.7%). Among the
229 surrogates participating in the study, 98 (43%) were more
optimistic than physicians and 24 (10%) were more pessimis-
tic. Sixty-five instances (28%) were related to a combination
of misunderstandings by surrogates and differences in belief
between the physician and surrogate about the patient’
s prog-
nosis; 38 (17%) were related to misunderstanding only; 7 (3%)
were related to different beliefs; and data were missing for 12.
Accuracy of Physicians’ and Surrogates’ Prognostic Estimates
Surrogates’estimates of prognosis were much more accurate
than random guessing, but physicians’estimates were statis-
tically significantly more accurate than surrogates’(C statis-
tic, 0.83 vs 0.74, respectively; absolute difference, 0.094; 95%
CI, 0.024-0.163; P = .008) (Figure 2).
Surrogates’ Explanations for Optimism and Pessimism
Seventy-one of 156 surrogates who participated in the semi-
structured interview were more optimistic than physicians.
Three main themes emerged from the interviews about why
surrogates held beliefs about a patient’
s prognosis that were
more optimistic than what they perceived to be the physi-
cian’
s prognostic estimate (Table 4). First, some surrogates
(n = 34) believed that maintaining optimism would improve
the patient’
s outcomes or protect themselves from emo-
tional distress. One surrogate said “I really believe in good
vibrations …. So I think if we put everything that is in our
power to have good vibrations … we might be able to help
him with that.” Another surrogate explained “I’
m told to
always think positive and so I’
m kinda trying to make
myself feel better.”
Second, some surrogates (n = 24) expressed a belief that
the patient has unique strengths unknown to the physician.
For example, one surrogate of a 63-year-old man in respira-
tory failure explained “I know him personally. The doctors

don’

t know his will to live and his
will power and how strong he is and his family history.”
Third, some surrogates (n = 19) explained that their opti-
mism was grounded in their religious beliefs. For example,
one surrogate said “I really believe whether someone can live
or not is up to God. If God wants someone to heal, even
though the doctor thinks it’
s impossible, I think someone
can recover.
”
Surrogates cited several reasons for holding a more pes-
simistic belief about a patient’
s prognosis than what they un-
derstood to be the physician’
s estimate (Table 4). The most
common reason was a belief that the physician was intrinsi-
cally optimistic. A second reason was the physician’
s lack of
knowledge of the patient’
s unique attributes that negatively
affected their prognosis, such as the patient’
s weak physical
baseline or loss of will to live. Additional reasons included a
belief that the physician’
s judgment was clouded by emo-
tional investment in the patient and that the surrogate needed
to be pessimistic to brace or prepare themselves for the pos-
sibility of the patient’
s death.
Discussion
Among a diverse cohort of critically ill patients at high risk of
death, we found a high prevalence of physician-surrogate dis-
cordanceaboutprognosis.Thediscordancewasassociatedwith
both misunderstandings by surrogates of physicians’assess-
ment of prognosis and by surrogates holding different beliefs
about a patient’
s prognosis compared with what they per-
ceived to be the physician’
s assessment of prognosis. The find-
ings suggest that interventions are needed not only to im-
provethecomprehensibilityofprognosticinformationbutalso
to attend to the emotional and psychological factors that in-
fluence surrogates’prognostic expectations.
Four empirical studies have addressed reasons for physi-
cian-surrogate discordance about prognosis in ICUs10-12,28
(eAppendix in the Supplement). Two small studies using hy-
pothetical vignettes found that surrogates’misperceptions

On the patient’
s fifth day of mechanical ventilation, surrogates and physicians
independently estimated the probability that the patient would survive the
hospitalization (on a 0%-100% scale). Receiver operating characteristic curves
were generated using mixed-effects regression models with patients nested
within surrogates within physicians, patient mortality as a dependent variable,
surrogate and physician survival estimates as independent variables, and
physician as a random intercept (see eAppendix in the Supplement for
additional details). The dotted diagonal line represents no predictive power. The
prognostic accuracy of physicians was superior to that of surrogates (P = .008).

aboutprognosisaroseinpartfromoptimisticbiasesratherthan
only from misunderstandings.10,12 Two studies using in-
depth interviews of small numbers of surrogates found that
surrogates’religiousbeliefs,aneedtomaintainhope,andskep-
ticism about physicians’prognostic accuracy contributed to
differences in beliefs about prognosis between physicians and
surrogates.11,28 The limitations of these studies are that they
involvedsmallsamplesizesandhypotheticalcasesanddidnot
simultaneously provide quantitative estimates of mispercep-
tions about prognosis and qualitative insights about the fac-
tors that contributed to those misperceptions. The present
study overcomes these limitations to demonstrate that in ac-
tual cases in ICUs, both misunderstandings by surrogates of
physicians’prognostications as well as differences in belief
about patients’prognoses contribute to physician-surrogate
discordance about prognosis.
The pattern of our findings fits with insights from social
psychology about biases in individuals’risk perceptions. One
such insight, termed the better-than-average effect, refers to
the tendency of individuals to rate themselves as likely to have
better outcomes than most others.29 Our results may in part
be explained by a similar phenomenon. If so, our findings sug-
gest that this bias is not limited to individuals predicting their
own outcomes but also extends to individuals predicting out-
comes of their loved ones.
A noteworthy finding from our semistructured inter-
views is that some surrogates intentionally held overly opti-
mistic prognostic estimates with the hope that doing so would
improve the patient’
s outcome. This phenomenon has previ-
ously been described as performative optimism, which is the
belief that by thinking optimistic thoughts, an individual may
influence their (or others’
) likelihood of experiencing a posi-
tive outcome. Sulmasy et al30 found that 36 of 45 research par-
ticipants explained their optimistic expectations regarding
phase 1 trial participation in terms of believing that maintain-
ing an optimistic attitude would improve their outcomes.
Should clinicians and policy makers be concerned that a
large proportion of surrogates in ICUs hold overly optimistic
expectations about prognosis? In one view, it is encouraging
that the accuracy of surrogates’prognostic estimates was
substantially better than chance alone and comparable with
the accuracy of many accepted clinical risk prediction mod-
els. However, surrogates’expectations differed substantially
from physicians’
, and physicians’predictions were statisti-
cally significantly more accurate. This finding raises concerns
that one of the fundamental assumptions of shared decision
making—agreement between parties about the likely out-
comes of treatment—is often not achieved.31
Another concern is that the prevalent optimism among
surrogates may lead to overuse of expensive, life-prolonging
treatments in dying patients and underuse of palliative treat-
ments. This concern is supported by a series of studies indi-
cating that individuals’willingness to undergo intensive
treatment near the end of life is strongly influenced by the
Table 4. Reasons for Overly Optimistic or Overly Pessimistic Prognostic Estimates by Surrogates
Reason
Exemplar
Overly optimistic expectations
Surrogate believes the patient has unique strengths
unknown to the physician
“I feel that my brother’
s a fighter and I know him more than what the doctor do. And when you don’
t
know a person, it’
s pretty much, ‘
This is what I read in a book.’And I’
m not reading from no book.
I’
m reading from experience. I think I know my brother a little bit better.”
“I don’
t think they know her … these people, I think they’
ve just met her for the first time. And I think
they have to be as honest as they can with what information that they have. It’
s hard for them to know
how well she can respond, unless you’
ve actually been with her through other illnesses. We can just
guess all we want, but from her response to her illnesses before, she’
s been OK.”
Surrogate has a need to maintain hope for their
own benefit or for the patient’
s benefit
“It goes off of purely me trying to have a positive outlook. I almost feel like if I circle 50%, then it may
come true. If I circle 50%, then I’
m not putting all my positive energy towards my dad.”
Optimism grounded in religious beliefs
“I believe the doctor would only believe what he can do for my son. But I believe what he can do and
what God can do.”
“Probably would be the feeling of our association with God and the fact that we believe in prayer. We
believe in miracles.”
Surrogate believes the physician is dispositionally
pessimistic
“Just in my dealings with physicians, in the last 10 years or so, I would say I don’
t see a lot of optimism
any more in the medical professions, in general. They’
re not very overt in the way that they present it.
They’
re very guarded in their emotions.”
“Maybe they’
ve seen more people die than I have … well, I just know that when you are around
something a lot more, you become desensitized to it as a result. So that’
s really what I mean by being a
little less invested.”
Overly pessimistic expectations
Surrogate has a need to be pessimistic for his/her
own benefit
“Maybe I’
m just trying to protect myself. I’
m trying to stay at that baseline, so that I’
m not completely
surprised if it doesn’
t go well. So I’
m trying not to get too excited or … optimistic about anything,
because I don’
t have the information.”
“I think if I estimate less and he’
ll survive, it will be even better than to estimate more and then to be
disappointed … It’
s better to have worse expectation now. If he survives, then it will be even better … so
we will be very happy. If otherwise, we will think that he will survive … and then it will be the opposite,
so we will be very upset. So, it’
s better to think this way, for me.”
Surrogate believes the patient has weaknesses
unknown to the physician
“I guess my difference is, I don’
t know if [he] wants it, my brother. I don’
t know how much fight he’
s got
left in him.”
“He’
s [the physician] more optimistic than I am because he’
s not fully aware of her medical problems
from throughout the years, the last dozen years or so and I am … so, they’
re being a little more
optimistic about it, right now, than I am. Only because I know her better.”
Surrogate believes the physician is dispositionally
optimistic
“I think that doctors, and particularly certain types of doctors, can tend to be a little overoptimistic.
Say, for example, surgeons, they don’
t emphasize the possible down sides and risks of a procedure.”
“For being a doctor, I think you have to be optimistic. If the doctor is not optimistic, then what are the
family members gonna think about him? They’
re doing this job to save the patient.”

likely outcomes. For example, among a cohort of seriously ill
outpatients, Fried et al32 found that as the likelihood of suc-
cessful treatment declined, so too did individuals’willing-
ness to undergo intensive treatment. Among a cohort of
patients with advanced dementia, Mitchell et al5 found that
patients with surrogates who had accurate expectations of
the patients’prognoses were less likely to receive invasive
treatments near the end of life. Among parents of children
with incurable cancer, Wolfe et al6 found that parents with
accurate expectations about incurability of the cancer
focused treatment more on lessening discomfort and inte-
grating palliative care compared with those who had delayed
recognition of the child’
s poor prognosis.
There are at least 2 clinical implications of our findings.
First, given the high rates of discordance about prognosis, cli-
nicians communicating with surrogates of patients with ad-
vanced critical illness should routinely check in with surro-
gates about their perceptions of prognosis prior to engaging
in decision making about goals of care. Second, when clini-
cians recognize that surrogates’expectations about progno-
sis diverge from their own, they should explore the possibil-
ity that causes other than misunderstanding may be
contributing, such as a belief that the patient is stronger than
average, a belief that expressing optimism will improve the pa-
tient’
s outcome, or a belief that religious rather than biomedi-
cal considerations will determine the patient’
s outcome. This
is important because interventions to reconcile discordance
about prognosis may differ for misunderstandings compared
with differences in belief. Our findings raise the possibility that
standardinformationalinterventionssuchasdecisionaidsmay
beinsufficientbecausetheydonotattendtotheemotionaland
psychological sources of optimism that influence surrogates’
prognostic expectations.
This study has several strengths. First, we used a mixed-
methods approach, which allowed for both quantification of
discordance and qualitative exploration of the reasons be-
hind surrogates’beliefs. We validated our qualitative find-
ings through a process of member checking in which we re-
turned the results to research participants for their review and
comment. The study was conducted in a large and diverse co-
hort. Additionally, we interviewed actual surrogates facing ac-
tual decisions rather than using simulation, which estab-
lished the clinical relevance of our findings.
This study also has several limitations. Although we re-
cruited a diverse cohort, our sample was limited to one re-
gion of the country, which may not account for some geo-
graphic or cultural factors. An inherent limitation of using
interviews to understand what influences individuals is that
it only allows for identification of beliefs of which individuals
have conscious awareness and are willing to express, and we
cannot exclude that processes surrogates were not conscious
of or were unwilling to discuss may also have contributed.
Conclusions
Among critically ill patients receiving care in ICUs, discor-
dant expectations about prognosis were common between pa-
tients’physicians and surrogate decision makers and were re-
lated to both misunderstandings by surrogates about
physicians’assessments of patients’prognoses and differ-
ences in beliefs about patients’prognoses.
