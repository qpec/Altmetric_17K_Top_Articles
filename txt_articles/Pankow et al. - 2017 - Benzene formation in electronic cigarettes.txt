Abstract
Background/Objective
The heating of the fluids used in electronic cigarettes (“e-cigarettes”) used to create “vaping”
aerosols is capable of causing a wide range of degradation reaction products. We investi-
gated formation of benzene (an important human carcinogen) from e-cigarette fluids contain-
ing propylene glycol (PG), glycerol (GL), benzoic acid, the flavor chemical benzaldehyde,
and nicotine.
Methods/Main results
Three e-cigarette devices were used: the JUULTM “pod” system (provides no user accessible
settings other than flavor cartridge choice), and two refill tank systems that allowed a range of
user accessible power settings. Benzene in the e-cigarette aerosols was determined by gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry. Benzene formation was ND (not detected) in the JUUL
system. In the two tank systems benzene was found to form from propylene glycol (PG) and
glycerol (GL), and from the additives benzoic acid and benzaldehyde, especially at high power
settings. With 50:50 PG+GL, for tank device 1 at 6W and 13W, the formed benzene concen-
trations were 1.9 and 750 μg/m3. For tank device 2, at 6W and 25W, the formed concentrations
were ND and 1.8 μg/m3. With benzoic acid and benzaldehyde at ~10 mg/mL, for tank device
1, values at 13W were as high as 5000 μg/m3. For tank device 2 at 25W, all values were
�~100 μg/m3. These values may be compared with what can be expected in a conventional
(tobacco) cigarette, namely 200,000 μg/m3. Thus, the risks from benzene will be lower from e-
cigarettes than from conventional cigarettes. However, ambient benzene air concentrations in
the U.S. have typically been 1 μg/m3, so that benzene has been named the largest single
known cancer-risk air toxic in the U.S. For non-smokers, chronically repeated exposure to ben-
zene from e-cigarettes at levels such as 100 or higher μg/m3 will not be of negligible risk.
Introduction
Electronic cigarettes (“e-cigarettes”) use an electrical resistance coil to vaporize mixtures
of propylene glycol (PG), glycerol (GL), nicotine, and flavor chemicals. Vaporization of an

 e-liquid containing mostly PG and/or GL requires a temperature of ~190 to 290˚C: when the
ambient pressure is 1 atm, PG boils at ~190˚C, GL boils at ~290˚C, and PG+GL mixtures will
boil between ~190 and ~290˚C; the presence of other constituents besides PG and GL (such as
water and flavor chemicals) will affect the boiling point. (The presence of significant percent-
ages of other constituents (e.g., water and flavor chemicals) will affect the boiling point.) Tem-
peratures higher than the boiling point of an e-liquid are possible in the coil zone if the rate of
e-liquid delivery to the coil does not keep pace with the heat delivery rate: the vicinity of the
coil becomes “dry”, and the heat delivery rate surpasses the rate at which heat is carried away
by evaporated liquid as “latent heat”.
In general, e-cigarette aerosols tend to be simpler in composition than cigarette aerosols:
“e-liquids” are a simpler starting matrix as compared to cigarette filler, and burning cigarettes
have been reported to reach 900˚C,[1]. Neverthless, multiple toxicants can form upon heating
PG and GL.[2–6] Thermal dehydration of PG with loss of one water molecule gives acetalde-
hyde, and thermal dehydration of GL with loss of two water molecules gives acrolein [2, 6].
Significant amounts of formaldehyde are also possible.[3,4] Kim and Kim [7], using a PG+GL
refill fluid (zero nicotine), an unnamed refillable tank device operated, and unspecified set-
tings, reported finding benzene (a known human carcinogen [8,9]) in e-cigarette aerosols at
87.5 μg/m3. McAuley et al.[10], however, using a simple draw-activated device, reported that
benzene was mostly “not found”.
Dehydration of GL to benzene has been observed [11], and in e-cigarettes a simple dehydra-
tion stoichiometry could be PG + GL = benzene + 5 H2O (Fig 1A). A second route to benzene
in e-cigarettes is decarboxylation of benzoic acid (Fig 1B), and benzene has been known to
form when benzoic acid is used as a preservative in beverages.[12] (Benzoic acid has been
found by our laboratory in 14 out of 150 e-liquid refill products at levels estimated to be in the
range 0.02 to 2 mg/mL, and benzoic acid is an acknowledged ingredient in e-liquids in the
JUUL product line.[13]) For a third route to benzene, many aromatic aldehydes are major e-
liquid flavor additives, including benzaldehyde (for “cherry”), vanillin, and ethyl vanillin: alde-
hyde levels as high as several percent (by mass) have been found.[14] Every aldehyde can be
oxidized to its corresponding carboxylic acid, which may then undergo decarboxlation. Thus,
oxidation of benzaldehyde can give benzoic acid, and therefore, benzene (Fig 1C). For a fourth
route to benzene, in what amounts to abiotic fermentation, an aldehyde can undergo redox
disproportionation to form a mix of the corresponding alcohol and the acid, and the latter
may then undergo decarboxylation. (The acid is more oxidized then the aldehyde, and the
alcohol is less oxidized than the aldehyde.) With benzaldehyde, a mix of benzoic acid and ben-
zyl alcohol can then be formed (Fig 1D). (The disproportionation of an aldehyde lacking an
“alpha-position” hydrogen atom is the Cannizzaro reaction, which is base-catalyzed (possibly
then, by nicotine).)
Herein we describe measurements of gas-phase benzene in e-cigarette aerosols from
three types of e-cigarette: a non-refillable e-cigarette (JUULTM), and two variable-power,
tank-type devices. For experiments with the tank devices, the fluids used were prepared in
the laboratory from PG, GL, benzoic acid, benzaldehyde, and/or nicotine (see Table 1 for
compositions). The power settings used for the tank units ranged from “recommended” to
beyond. The higher settings were used because they: 1) were accessible by normal use of the
devices; 2) may not be “distasteful” to absolutely every user in every use circumstance; 3)
will certainly be encountered by users experimenting with settings (as innumerable postings
on social media attest); and 4) provide useful information regarding the potential for toxi-
cant formation in e-cigarettes.

 chromatography with detection by mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Three different e-cigarette
devices were used in the ATD determinations: 1) JUULTM personal vaporizer and refill car-
tridges (“pods”) (Pax Inc., San Francisco, CA) in four different flavors (tobacco, mint, fruit,
and crème bru
ˆle
´e) were purchased online in May 2016 (the fluids were analyzed in this
study to determine the levels of benzoic acid and nicotine); 2) EVODTM tank-type atomizer
(Kangertech, Shenzhen, China) with 1.8 ohm resistance single horizontal coil and silica
wicking material, purchased online in July, 2016; and 3) Subtank NanoTM V.1 (Kangertech)
tank-type atomizer with 1.2 ohm resistance single vertical “OCC” single coil and cotton
wicking material, purchased online in July, 2016. The JUULTM system has no user options
other than flavor of the cartridge selected. For the EVODTM and Subtank NanoTM devices:
1) the “recommended” settings were 6W and 10 to 26W, respectively; 2) each replicate aero-
sol sample for gaseous benzene determination proceeded using a clean tank and a new coil
so that any run-to-run changes in benzene production would not be caused by “aging” of
the coil etc.; 3) at every wattage setting tested, sample collection was begun 2 h after “condi-
tioning” the new coil; 4) conditioning occurred by taking six 50 mL puffs at 6 W for the
EVOD device and 13W for Subtank NanoTM device respectively.
Sampling
For all three devices, each ATD sample was taken as three or six 50 mL puffs without power
(blanks) or with power (aerosol samples) with a puff duration of 5 s and puff-to-puff interval
of 60 s. (Regarding the selected puff duration, Hua et al. [15] used a data mining exercise for
64 different ENDS users on YouTube to obtain an average puff duration of 4.3 seconds ± 1.4
seconds (SD) for men, and an average of 4.0 seconds ± 0.8 seconds (SD) for women.)
Each ATD sample comprised an average benzene level for six puffs. For the JUULTM device,
blank samples were collected by drawing lab air through an electrically disconnected cartridge.
For e-cigarette aerosol sampling, the JUULTM battery was then connected and device activa-
tion occurred automatically as a disposable 60 mL syringe was used to manually pull a puff
through a 0.45 μm pore size 28 mm diameter (Phenomenex Inc., Torrance, CA) glass fiber/cel-
lulose acetate (GF/CA) filter (to remove the aerosol droplets), followed by a single ATD gas
sampling cartridge containing 100 mg of 35/60 mesh Tenax TA and 200 mg of 60/80 mesh
Carbograph 1 TD (Camsco Inc., Houston, TX). All four different JUULTM flavors were tested.
The direct “butt” connections to the filter were held in place using short pieces of flexible 0.125

 in. i.d. polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tubing. The benzene levels obtained are minimum values
because of the possibility of some small sorptive loss to the PVC pieces; the PVC pieces were
replaced after each sample. For the method used (indoor sampling), blank levels corresponded
to ~5 μg/m3. Final values given are blank-corrected; values not significantly above the blank
level are reported as “not detected” (ND).
For the two tank units, the device used for drawing e-cigarette puffs involved a programma-
ble syringe pump. As above, direct “butt” connections were made using short pieces of PVC
tubing. Blanks were obtained without activating the power. For vaping, flow for each sample
was sequentially drawn through: 1) a GF/CA filter as above; 2) single ATD gas sampling car-
tridge as above; a 3) three way “T” valve connected to a 1 L Tedlar bag (Model 24633 Supelco
Inc. (Bellefonte, PA); and 4) a syringe pump (Model NE-1010, New Era Pump Systems Inc.,
Farmingdale, NY). Minimal “butt” connections were made as above. For verification of the
total sample volume, the puffs were exhausted from the syringe pump back through the three
way valve and into the Tedlar bag. Again, final values are blank-corrected, and values not sig-
nificantly above the blank level are reported as ND.
For confirmation of the formation of benzene in the e-cigarette aerosols by nuclear mag-
netic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, aerosol samples were created using an EVODTM device
(as above) with 50:50 PG+GL containing benzoic acid at 1% by weight. Aerosol was generated
at 14 W (2 ohms resistance) using five 50 mL puffs, each drawn over five seconds with a puff
interval of 1 min. In an approach similar to that described by Jensen et al. [4], the aerosol was
drawn into a 1 mL septum vial containing 600 μL of DMSO-d6. The flow inlet to the vial was
an 18 gauge needle, as was the flow outlet. (Gas-phase benzene will be captured efficiently by
this method.) Samples were run using a 600 MHz NMR spectrometer.
Mass of e-liquid vaped
Values for mg of e-liquid vaped per puff (and for the resulting TPM concentration) were esti-
mated based on weight loss of the e-cigarette unit for each run.
Gas-phase benzene
For all the e-cigarette aerosol samples, >89% of the benzene can be deduced to have been in
the gas phase as follows: 1) As discussed by Pankow et al.[16,17] the percent of a compound in
the gas phase of an aerosol is given by P(%) = 100%/(1+KpTPM) where Kp (m3/μg) is the gas-
to-particle (i.e. droplet) partition coefficient, and TPM is the suspended “total particulate mat-
ter” level for the aerosol. 2) It can be estimated that Kp � 10−9.7 m3/μg for benzene at 20˚C for
partitioning to e-cigarette aerosol particles (as based on the approach of Pankow et al.,[16,17]
using a benzene vapor pressure of 0.099 atm at t = 20˚C,[18] an activity coefficient for benzene
(zbenzene) in glycol solutions of ~14 [19], and an average molecular weight of
�
MW � 84 g/mol
for a 50:50 by volume PG:GL mixture). 3) For all the aerosols created here, TPM � 108.8 μg/m3
(= aerosolized liquid mass/total puff volume). Then P(%) � 100%/(1+10−9.7108.8) = 89%.
ATD cartridge analyses by GC/MS
For each standard sample for method calibration, an ATD cartridge was charged with 2 or
4 μL of a 1 to 100 ng/μL solution of benzene in methanol, followed by a 50 mL/min flow of
nitrogen for 10 min. Each ATD sample cartridge and each standard ATD cartridge was ther-
mally desorbed using a TurboMatrix 650 ATD unit (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Prior to
desorption, the ATD unit automatically amended each cartridge with 20 ng of fluorobenzene
as the internal standard compound. Each ATD cartridge was thermally desorbed for 10 min at
285˚C with helium desorption flow of 40 mL/min and split flow of 20 mL/min. The desorption

 stream was trapped at -10˚C on the intermediate “air monitoring trap” (ATP). The ATP was
then thermally desorbed at 295˚C and 25 psi constant pressure helium with a split flow of 8
mL/min for 4 min. The non-split portion of the desorption gas stream passed onto the GC col-
umn which was mounted in an Agilent (Santa Clara, CA) 7890A GC. The GC was interfaced
to an Agilent 5975C MS operated in electron impact ionization mode. The MS scan range was
34 to 400 amu. The electron multiplier voltage was 1400 V. The fused silica capillary GC col-
umn was a model Rxi-624Sil MS (Restek Inc., Bellefonte, PA) of 30 m length, 0.25 mm i.d.,
and 1.4 μm film thickness.
JUULTM pod analyses by LC/UV
JUULTM pods were opened to obtain the e-liquid for determination of the benzoic acid and
nicotine concentrations. Aliquots of 100 μL were withdrawn, diluted 1:100 with methanol,
and filtered with a syringe-mounted PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) filter, 13 mm diameter,
0.22 μm pore size, obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. (Waltham, MA). Analyses pro-
ceeded by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using an injection volume of 20 μL,
a Waters Corp. (Milford, MA) Model 1525 binary solvent delivery module (with Rheodyne 7725i
injector), a Discovery™ C-18 column (250 × 4.6 mm × 5 μm, Supelco Inc.) at 40˚C, and a Waters
Corp. Model 2996 photodiode array detector. The mobile phase composition was maintained iso-
cratic, 40:60 methanol:water amended with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (1 mL/min). The detector
wavelength for benzoic acid was 228 nm, and 259 nm for nicotine. The calibration ranges for the
injected standards were 0 to 1 mg/mL for benzoic acid, and 0 to 0.1 mg/mL for nicotine.
Results and discussion
Benzoic acid and nicotine levels in JUULTM pod fluids
The concentrations of benzoic acid and nicotine in the JUULTM pod fluids were found to be
44.8 ± 0.6 and 61.6 ± 1.5 mg/mL respectively, corresponding to a benzoic acid/nicotine molar
concentration ratio of 0.97 to 1). For comparison, as noted above, analyses in our laboratory
have indicated the presence of benzoic acid in 14 commercial refill e-liquids at levels estimated
to be in the range 0.02 to 2 mg/mL.
Benzene confirmation by NMR
Benzene formation (12C6) was confirmed by NMR for e-cigarette aerosol collected in DMSO-
d6 and generated with the EVODTM device operated at 14 W (2 ohms resistance) using 50:50
PG+GL (both 12C3) containing benzoic acid (12C6) at 1% by weight. The expected strong sin-
glet peak in DMSO-d6 at 7.37 ppm [20] was observed; addition of authentic benzene caused
the peak to increase without introduction of other peaks.
Formation of 13C6 benzene From 50:50 PG+GL (both 13C3)
Formation of benzene with all carbons 13C (i.e., 13C6 benzene, MW = 84) was confirmed to
occur from 50:50 PG+GL (both 13C3) (see Table 1) at levels consistent with the analogous runs
with 50:50 PG+GL (both 12C3) (see Table 1).
Gas-phase benzene levels measured in e-cigarette aerosols
Gas-phase benzene was not found above blank levels in any of the JUULTM samples for any of
the four flavors. For the other two devices, benzene gas-phase concentrations and deliveries
(as μg benzene per g e-liquid vaped) are summarized in Fig 2, with other details provided in
Table 1. Benzene formation was found to be very strongly dependent on device. With 50:50

 PG+GL, for the EVOD device at 6W and 13W, the mean concentration values were 1.7 and
750 μg/m3, respectively. For the Subtank Nano device, at 6W and 25W, the mean values were
remarkably lower, namely ND and only 1.5 μg/m3, respectively.
Significant formation from benzoic acid and benzaldehyde was observed for both the
EVOD and Subtank Nano devices at the high power settings used. With benzoic acid and
benzaldehyde at 9 to 10 mg/mL, for the EVOD device, values at higher power levels were as
high as 5000 μg/m3. Remarkably, the values at the higher power levels for the Subtank Nano
device were much lower, � ~100 μg/m3.
Comparisons with benzene levels in ambient air and cigarette tobacco
smoke
For tobacco smoke from “regular” cigarettes, the 1999 Massachusetts Benchmark Study [21]
reported an average benzene delivery of 86 μg/cigarette. Assuming a total puff volume of ~400
mL/cigarette for the smoking protocol used [22], such deliveries correspond to a smoke ben-
zene concentration of ~200,000 μg/m3, and so a much higher risk from benzene for chronic use
of tobacco cigarettes as compared to e-cigarettes. However, median ambient air concentrations
of benzene in locations in the U.S. in 2013 were ~1 μg/m3 [23]. Levels such as these resulted in
benzene being named by the 2002 National-Scale Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) as the largest
single known cancer-risk air toxic in the U.S.[24]. It can therefore be concluded for non-smok-
ers that chronically repeated exposure to benzene from e-cigarettes at levels such as 100 μg/m3
will not be of negligible risk.
