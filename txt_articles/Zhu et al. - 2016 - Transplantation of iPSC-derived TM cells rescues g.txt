Glaucoma is a common cause of vision loss or blindness and
reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) has been proven beneficial in
a large fraction of glaucoma patients. The IOP is maintained by the
trabecular meshwork (TM) and the elevation of IOP in open-angle
glaucoma is associated with dysfunction and loss of the postmitotic
cells residing within this tissue. To determine if IOP control can be
maintained by replacing lost TM cells, we transplanted TM-like
cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells into the anterior
chamber of a transgenic mouse model of glaucoma. Transplantation
led to significantly reduced IOP and improved aqueous humor out-
flow facility, which was sustained for at least 9 wk. The ability to
maintain normal IOP engendered survival of retinal ganglion cells,
whose loss is ultimately the cause for reduced vision in glaucoma. In
vivo and in vitro analyses demonstrated higher TM cellularity in
treated mice compared with littermate controls and indicated that
this increase is primarily because of a proliferative response of en-
dogenous TM cells. Thus, our study provides in vivo demonstration
that regeneration of the glaucomatous TM is possible and points
toward novel approaches in the treatment of this disease.

laucoma is one of the most common causes of irreversible
vision loss and blindness worldwide; ∼60 million suffer from
this disease, and of these, 7 million are blind (1). By definition all
glaucoma involves some degree of vision loss, which is because of
the death of retinal ganglion cells (RGC), as well as degeneration
of the optic nerve head, the optic nerve, and the lateral geniculate
nucleus (2, 3). Advanced age and elevated intraocular pressure
(IOP) are the two most significant risk factors for the development
of glaucoma. Elevated IOP is typically a result of disturbances in
the balance of aqueous humor production and drainage. Aqueous
humor is continuously synthesized within the eye and drained
primarily through the trabecular meshwork (TM), a specialized
structure located anterior to the root of the iris. Although occlu-
sion of the aqueous humor outflow pathways can occur through
several mechanisms, in the United States and other Western
populations the most common form of glaucoma is primary open
angle glaucoma (POAG), which manifests no gross abnormalities
to the anterior portion of the eye.
Randomized clinical trials have shown that reduction of IOP
slows the onset and progression of glaucoma, even in patients
without suspicious elevation of IOP (4, 5). Although there has been
increasing awareness that factors other than elevated IOP contrib-
ute to glaucomatous damage, to date all treatments for glaucoma
remain aimed at reducing IOP either through surgical or medical
means, which has resulted in significant preservation of vision and
increased quality of life for millions of glaucoma patients (6, 7).
Although the TM in eyes with POAG appears relatively normal
at a gross morphological level, a number of more subtle changes
influencing the mechanical properties of the TM collagen beams
and the accumulation of macromolecules have been observed that
might increase outflow resistance (8, 9). The stiffness of the TM in
eyes with glaucoma is significantly increased compared with that of
normal TM and it is likely that reduced elasticity has significant
ramifications on IOP maintenance (10, 11). Contraction and re-
laxation of the ciliary muscle and the resulting compaction and
opening of the TM significantly affect aqueous humor outflow.
Data have additionally demonstrated that contractile filaments in
the TM cell cytoplasm exist, indicating that TM cells themselves
may contract (12). Histologically, thickening of the trabecular
beams and fusing of trabecular lamellae because of adhesions of the
denuded portions of the trabeculae and accumulation of fibrillar
plaque material in the juxtacanalicular tissue have been associated
with POAG (13, 14).
The TM is populated by specialized postmitotic cells of mes-
enchymal origin. TM cells are gradually lost throughout life in all
individuals and, under normal circumstances, they are not replaced
(15). A number of studies have demonstrated that loss of TM cells
is higher in POAG patients than in age-matched controls (16–18).
The effects of lower TM cellularity are currently unclear, but it has
been proposed that reduced TM cellularity, or the functional de-
cline of surviving TM cells, engenders a reduced ability to maintain
TM homeostasis and causes structural aberrations within the TM.
The notion that TM function can be restored in eyes with POAG
is supported through studies of eyes having received laser trabe-
culoplasty, a technique that is frequently used for the management
of elevated IOP in POAG. In this procedure, a laser is used to
focally coagulate the uveal TM, resulting in diffuse stimulation of
Significance
The regulation of intraocular pressure (IOP) is vital for the health
of the eye. Failure to maintain IOP frequently leads to vision loss in
glaucoma. The IOP is maintained by the trabecular meshwork
(TM), which exhibits decreased cellular density with age and dis-
ease. Here we demonstrate that induced pluripotent stem cells
differentiated into TM cells (designated iPSC-TM) restore TM
function for over 9 wk, regulate IOP, and prevent neuronal loss in
a glaucoma mouse model. Transplanted iPSC-TM survive in the
TM, but the most pronounced effect of transplantation is a robust
proliferative response of endogenous TM cells. These findings
suggest that lasting restoration of IOP control through iPSC-TM
transplantation is possible and may represent a novel treatment
approach for glaucoma.

 TM cells (19, 20). One well-documented effect of laser trabecu-
loplasty is that it causes an increase in TM cell division, leading to
the conclusion that the laser burn induces a repair process by
repopulating a cell deficient TM (21, 22).
We previously demonstrated that induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSC) can be differentiated into a cell type, designated iPSC-TM,
which resembles primary TM cells (pTM) (23). iPSC-TM are
morphologically very similar to pTM, express a large number of
proteins characteristic of TM, and functionally respond to various
stimuli in a manner typical of TM cells. Herein we provide func-
tional data to demonstrate that transplantation of iPSC-TM into a
mouse model of glaucoma can restore IOP control and prevent
RGC degeneration. These studies were aided by the development
of a transgenic mouse model of glaucoma because of expression
of human myocilin with the disease causing mutation Y437H
(Tg-MYOCY437H) (24, 25). The eyes of these mice develop nor-
mally, and structural damage to the TM is modest, but significant
loss of TM cells, elevated IOP, and subsequent RGC loss is ob-
served as animals age (24). Thus, this mouse model provides an
unparalleled opportunity to examine TM function following iPSC-
TM transplantation. However, because loss and dysfunction of TM
cells is observed in all forms of open angle glaucoma, it is possible
that transplantation of iPSC-TM will be of benefit to a much larger
group of individuals than those with mutations in MYOC.
Results
Preparation and Characterization of iPSC-TM. As we have shown
previously, iPSC can be induced to differentiate into a cell type
(iPSC-TM) that strongly resembles pTM morphologically, func-
tionally, and compositionally (23). Here, mouse iPSC-TM were
induced from iPSC derived from fibroblasts isolated from trans-
genic animals constitutively expressing the cellular marker dsRed.
iPSC were seeded and, when confluency reached 5%, induced to
differentiate by maintaining them in biopsy media previously
conditioned by primary human TM cells. This approach induces
distinct morphological changes in the cultured cells (Fig. 1A). iPSC
grow in colonies of high cellular density and the ratio of nuclei to
cytoplasm is much higher than that of other cells types. However,
after 7-d differentiation, developing iPSC-TM have separated from
the colonies, begin to exhibit spindle-like morphology, and re-
semble primary cultured TM cells although they are smaller at this
stage. iPSC-TM continue to grow and after 14 d of differentiation
are of similar size and exhibit the typical morphology of pTM.
The transition to an iPSC-TM phenotype is accompanied by
profound changes in gene expression. After 14 d of differentiation,
increasing numbers of iPSC-TM are immunopositive for laminin
A4 (Lama4) and tissue inhibitor of matrix proteases 3 (Timp3),
molecules that are prominently expressed in native TM cells, but
not iPSC (Fig. 1B). These findings are supported by gene-expres-
sion analysis, demonstrating that expression of Lama4 and Timp3
increases during the transition from iPSC to iPSC-TM (Fig. 1C).
Conversely, the iPSC biomarkers Nanog homeobox (Nanog) and
SRY box 2 (Sox2) exhibit a progressive decrease in expression
levels during this process.
We’ve also previously demonstrated that iPSC-TM respond to
exposure to glucocorticoids with enhanced synthesis and secretion

 of myocilin (23). Another well-characterized response of TM cells
to glucocorticoid exposure is the formation of cross-linked actin
networks (CLANs) (26). These cytoskeletal structures form geo-
desic dome-like polygonal lattices and can be discriminated from
temporary arrangements of polygonal actin structures based on
the cell’s size and the height (Fig. 2 A and B). Previously published
studies indicate that ∼14% of human pTM and 30% of mouse
pTM cells form CLANs (26, 27). Here, iPSC-TM were differen-
tiated for 14 d and subsequently exposed to 100 nM dexametha-
sone (Dex) for 3 additional days. Controls included uninduced
iPSC and iPSC-TM treated with vehicle only. Our findings dem-
onstrate that CLANs are not observed in undifferentiated iPSC
(Fig. 2C). However, Dex treatment of iPSC-TM resulted in CLAN
formation in 23.62% ± 2.28 of all cells, whereas only 12.5% ± 0.48
of vehicle-treated iPSC-TM responded in this fashion (P = 0.041).
These data provide additional support to our previous findings
that our differentiation approach yields iPSC-TM that resemble
pTM in many important aspects.
Purification of iPSC-TM. The formation of tumors as a result of the
presence of remaining pluripotent cells is a significant safety
concern for in vivo studies using iPSC. To produce iPSC-TM cells
appropriate for transplantation, we used a negative-selection ap-
proach by removing cells still expressing markers of pluripotency
from the iPSC-TM population. After differentiation for 14 d,
stage-specific mouse embryonic antigen 1 positive (SSEA-1+) cells
were depleted using SSEA-1–conjugated magnetic beads. In our
hands four successive rounds of purification are required to
remove all SSEA-1+ cells (Table 1). Elimination of these cells is a
crucial aspect of this experimental approach. Transplantation of
50,000 iPSC-TM to the anterior chamber of normal recipient mice
resulted in tumor formation in over 7% of all eyes using the twice-
purified cell population containing 3% SSEA-1+ cells. However,
four rounds of purification effectively removed all SSEA-1+ cells
and transplantation of this fraction did not result in tumor for-
mation in any of the treated mice.
iPSC-TM purified in this manner can be further maintained in
vitro. iPSC-TM continue to express the dsRed transgene and re-
tain a morphological appearance similar to pTM cells (Fig. S1).
These data demonstrate that meticulous removal of iPSC with
remaining pluripotency is essential for use in vivo but also that
multiple rounds of magnetic separation are effective in creating a
stable and safe population of cells for transplantation.
Time Course of Damage in Tg-MYOCY437H Mice. These studies relied
on the use of a transgenic mouse model of glaucoma. These ani-
mals constitutively express human myocilin harboring a pathogenic
mutation (Tg-MYOCY437H) and display multiple glaucomatous
phenotypes, including TM cell loss, elevated IOP, and progressive
RGC loss (24). To further define the pathological stages of this
mouse model and to identify a suitable age for transplantation, we
improved upon our previously published data (24) by obtaining
detailed data for IOP, aqueous humor outflow facility, and TM
cellularity in 2-, 4-, and 6-mo-old Tg-MYOCY437H mice, as well as
in age-matched WT littermate controls (Fig. 3A). Congruent with
our previous findings, IOP in 2-mo-old Tg-MYOCY437H mice does
not differ from that observed in control animals. However, IOP
does increase with age in transgenic mice and, although IOP is
slightly elevated at age 4 mo (15.1 mmHg vs. 13.9 mmHg, P =
0.037), the difference becomes readily apparent by age 6 mo
(15.8 mmHg vs. 13.9 mmHg, P = 0.0019).
Measurements of aqueous humor outflow facility are more sen-
sitive in unmasking subtle disturbances in aqueous humor
drainage. We used this approach in the same groups of control
and Tg-MYOCY437H mice (Fig. 3B). As reported elsewhere (28), we
observed comparatively low outflow facility in young animals. In WT
mice aqueous humor outflow facility increases between 2 and 4 mo
of age (0.016 ± 0.008 and 0.029 ± 0.006 μL·min·mmHg, respectively)
but remains stable thereafter (0.030 ± 0.013 μL·min·mmHg in
6-mo-old WT mice). In Tg-MYOCY437H mice outflow facility
resembles that of young normal mice at a young age (0.017 ±
0.009 μL·min·mmHg) but, analogous to our observations for
IOP, deficiencies become apparent in 4-mo-old animals
(0.024 ± 0.011 μL·min·mmHg) and are statistically significant by
age 6 mo (0.014 ± 0.0007 μL·min·mmHg, P = 0.0124).
The development of aqueous humor outflow deficiencies is
accompanied by a progressive decrease in the cellular density of
the TM. Although the anterior segment, including the TM, de-
velops normally in transgenic animals, expression of MYOCY437H
leads to endoplasmic reticulum stress and TM cell loss (24). To
further define this process, we determined TM density, defined as
nuclei contained within the collagen IV immunoreactive tissue
overlying the Schlemm’s canal in 4- and 6-mo-old Tg-MYOCY437H
and control mice (Fig. 3C). Data obtained demonstrate that at the

 age of 4 mo very few TM cells have been lost in transgenic animals
(42.8 ± 8.6 cells vs. 46.3 ± 7.1 cells, P = 0.09), but a marked loss is
readily apparent at 6 mo (33.1 ± 9.5 cells vs. 45.8 ± 4.8 cells, P =
0.007) (Fig. 3D). The age of pronounced TM cell loss is con-
sistent with that at which functional deficits become apparent
and further demonstrates that the disruption of outflow facility
in Tg-MYOCY437H mice is a degenerative process, as opposed to a
developmental deficit. Minor effects of the mutation are apparent
at 4 mo of age, suggesting the onset of the degenerative process, but
disruption of aqueous humor dynamics accelerates thereafter and
becomes statistically significant in all parameters evaluated here.
iPSC-TM Transplantation in Vivo. Based upon our observation that
4-mo-old Tg-MYOCY437H mice exhibit the first signs of TM cell
loss, we sought to determine whether aqueous humor dynamics
can be preserved through the transplantation of iPSC-TM derived
from healthy mice. Therefore, 50,000 purified iPSC-TM were in-
jected into the anterior chamber of 4-mo-old Tg-MYOCY437H mice
in a volume of 3 μL PBS (n = 22). Additionally, we injected an
equal number of fibroblasts, a cell type known to secrete growth
factors that can support TM cell survival, in a second group of
transgenic mice (n = 8). Transgenic animals receiving an injection
of an equal volume of PBS served as controls (vehicle control, n =
16). In addition, age-matched WT mice (n = 20) were used. IOP
and outflow facility were determined before transplantation, as
well as 6 and 9 wk after injection (5.5 and 6.25 mo of age).
Consistent with the data shown above, the group of transgenic
animals used for these transplantation studies displayed minor dif-
ferences in IOP at the age of 4 mo compared with the WT controls
(14.4 ± 1.8 mmHg vs. 13.6 ± 1.6 mmHg) (Fig. 4A). Similarly, whereas
minor differences in the aqueous humor outflow facility were ap-
parent, statistical significance was not yet reached (0.024 ± 0.01 vs.
0.029 ± 0.006 μL·min·mmHg, P = 0.2) (Fig. 4B). As expected, 6-wk
later the IOP had risen and the aqueous humor outflow facility had
markedly decreased in vehicle control-injected transgenic animals
(16.4 ± 3.1 mmHg and 0.014 ± 0.005 μL·min·mmHg). In contrast,
IOP and outflow facility in iPSC-TM recipient eyes resembled that of
WT mice (12.6 ± 3.7 mmHg and 0.025 ± 0.01 μL·min·mmHg) and
were significantly better that those determined in the vehicle control
group (P = 0.001 and 0.02, respectively). IOP remained significantly
lower in iPSC-TM–treated animals than in vehicle control mice until
the last measurement was taken 9 wk after transplantation (12.2 ±
2.8 mmHg, P = 0.0006). At this point, aqueous humor outflow facility
also continued to be significantly higher in iPSC-TM recipient ani-
mals compared with PBS control mice (0.027 ± 0.01 vs. 0.011 ±
0.005 μL·min·mmHg, P = 0.017).
Transplantation of fibroblasts provided a minor improvement
of IOP and outflow facility, although a statistically significant
rescue effect compared with the vehicle control group could not
be demonstrated for either measure. IOP and outflow facility in
these mice were at 14.5 ± 3.5 mmHg (P = 0.15) and 0.022 ±
0.01 μL·min·mmHg (P = 0.09) 6 wk after transplantation. After
9 wk, IOP had slightly increased (14.6 ± 3.0 mmHg, P = 0.17) and
outflow facility declined to 0.016 ± 0.013 μL·min·mmHg (P =
0.45). However, because of the slightly improved outflow dynam-
ics, values obtained in fibroblast-injected mice are also not statis-
tically different from those of WT mice (P = 0.27 and 0.22 for
outflow facility and 0.7 and 0.6 for IOP at 6 and 9 wk, respectively).
Reduction of IOP to achieve RGC survival is a mainstay of
clinical glaucoma therapy. Importantly, in iPSC-TM recipient eyes
the reduction of IOP also resulted in RGC rescue. Mice were killed
12 wk after transplantation and surviving RGC were identified
through γ-synuclein immunoreactivity (Fig. 4C). Although this ap-
proach relies on continuous expression of this RGC marker, we and
others have found a high correlation between RGC numbers and
optic nerve damage (24, 29–34). Data obtained here demonstrate
that eyes of vehicle control Tg-MYOCY437H animals display a sig-
nificantly lower RGC density than those of WT controls (1706.9 ±
491.3 RGC/mm2 vs. 2171.9 ± 186.3 RGC/mm2, P = 0.027). In
contrast, iPSC-TM recipient eyes of transgenic mice display a RGC
density similar to WT mice and significantly higher density then the
vehicle control group (2222.1 ± 250.4 RGC/mm2, P = 0.041). A
protective effect was not apparent in the fibroblast group (1675.6 ±

 77.6 RGC/mm2, P = 0.92) (Fig. 4D). Taken together, these data
demonstrate that intraocular injection of iPSC-TM prevents IOP
elevation and aqueous humor outflow reduction and results in
preservation of RGC density in Tg-MYOCY437H mice.
Cellular Effects of iPSC-TM in Vivo. To estimate iPSC-TM survival in
vivo and to gain insight into the consequences of transplantation,
we determined both native TM cell and iPSC-TM density in study
animals. The immunohistochemical analysis of sagittal sections of
the anterior segment of iPSC-TM recipient eyes demonstrate that
iPSC-TM integrate into the TM and survive for at least 12 wk until
the end of the study period (Fig. 5A). Off-target integration was
also detected in other tissues of the anterior chamber, such as the
endothelial cell layer of the Schlemm’s canal, and the corneal
epithelium and stroma, particularly in the area surrounding the
injection site. However, there are no indications that these cells
compromise the function of the recipient eyes.
Histochemical evaluation of recipient eyes suggested that iPSC-
TM treatment results in slight hypertrophy of the TM (Fig. S2). To
quantify the number of implanted iPSC-TM and endogenous TM
cells in vivo we determined both the number of total nuclei in the
TM as well as the number of nuclei of dsRed immunopositive cells
in all experimental groups. Here, the TM was defined as the
collagen IV immunoreactive tissue overlying the Schlemm’s canal.
As expected, vehicle control animals exhibited a marked loss of
TM cell density compared with WT animals (25.7 ± 7.3 TM per
section vs. 57.1 ± 12.1 TM per section, P = 0.00014) (Fig. 5B).
Injection of fibroblasts again resulted in a slight improvement, but
did not result in a significant increase (38.7 ± 1.5 TM per section,
P = 0.09). In contrast, the cellular density of the TM in transgenic
iPSC-TM recipient mice was significantly higher than that of
vehicle controls (54.9 ± 7.2 TM per section, P = 6.83E-06) and
similar to that of WT animals. Interestingly, although sections of
iPSC-TM recipient mice contained on average 29.3 more cells per

 section than those of animals having received PBS injection, we
observed on average only 5.9 dsRed+ cells in each of the sections.
This finding suggests that the majority of the additional cells ob-
served in iPSC-TM recipients are not transplanted; rather, they
are endogenous cells that have either survived or were replaced
through division of the remaining cells.
Proproliferative Effect of iPSC-TM in Vitro. To determine if iPSC-TM
exert a proproliferative effect on normal mouse pTM cells, we
conducted a series of in vitro experiments. Cultures of pTM (27)
were infected with adenoviral vectors expressing the same myocilin
construct as in the transgenic mice (Ad5RSV-myocilinY437H). Ex-
pression of this mutated protein has been reported to result in
cellular stress and reduced cell survival (35–37).
Congruent with these findings, we observed slightly reduced
growth rates in transfected pTM cells (Fig. 6A): 50,000 untreated
pTM cultured in media alone proliferated to 81,558 ± 4,038 cells
within 4 d. The growth rate of pTM infected with Ad5RSV-
myocilinY437H is slightly reduced compared with the control
(69,383 ± 3,017 or 85.1%, P = 0.032). However, when Ad5RSV-
myocilinY437H–infected pTM were cultured in direct contact
with iPSC-TM, they exhibited distinctly higher growth rates
than the control cells. Cultures seeded with 50,000 Ad5RSV-
myocilinY437H–infected pTM and 50,000 dsRed+ iPSC-TM
contained 212,264 ± 3,147 cells after the 4-d growth period. Of
these, only 22,522 ± 6,122 (10.6%) cells are dsRed+ iPSC-TM
cells, whereas 189,742 ± 34,600 (89.4%) are pTM. This finding
represents a substantially elevated growth rate (232% of con-
trol), even compared with nonvector-treated control cells
maintained without iPSC-TM (P = 0.004).
A similar proproliferative effect was not observed when iPSC-
TM are physically separated from the pTM through the use of cell
culture inserts, allowing only the conditioned media to interact
with the pTM (Fig. 6B). Ad5RSV-myocilinY437H–infected pTM
maintained either in unconditioned media or media conditioned
through coculture with iPSC-TM exhibit replication rates similar
to control cells (83.4% and 99.8% of control, respectively).
The notion that direct contact with iPSC-TM leads to enhanced
proliferation of pTM was further supported by analysis of in-
corporation rates of the thymidine analog BrdU (Fig. 6C). In the
absence of iPSC-TM 21.3% ± 8.2 of pTM are BrdU+ after 2 h,
whereas coculture increases this fraction to 32.8% ± 12.4 of all
(dsRed−) pTM (P = 0.032). These data indicate that direct contact
between iPSC-TM and the target cell is required to initiate en-
hanced proliferation rates in pTM.
In Vivo Transcriptional Analysis. The above findings suggest that the
observed functional rescue in Tg-myocilinY437H mice is a result of
the re-entry of normally nonmitotic endogenous TM into cell di-
vision following stimulation by iPSC-TM. To further support this
hypothesis and to gather evidence for proliferation in our in vivo
model, we carried out global gene-expression analysis of the TM
of Tg-myocilinY437H mice harvested 12 wk after receiving iPSC-
TM, fibroblasts, or vehicle control injections. A total of 879 genes
exceeded the cut-off criteria (expression fold-change > 1.5 and
P < 0.01) and grouped into 83 clusters based upon their expression
profile (Fig. 7A). For subsequent Gene Ontology analysis, only
genes assigned to clusters containing at least three genes and with
a confidence value above 28 were selected (Fig. 7B). Analysis of
these 792 genes by the Panther Classification System (38) identi-
fied 265 genes whose functions are related to cellular processes,
including cell communication (129 genes) and cell cycle (56 genes)
(Dataset S1). These data add further support to the notion that
the presence of iPSC-TM induces proliferation and that this effect
can be maintained for an extended period.
Discussion
The IOP depends on the balance between aqueous humor pro-
duction by the ciliary body and drainage through the TM. In the
normal eye, resident endothelial cells of the TM maintain its
structure by continuously remodeling the TM beams and by
degrading debris that might otherwise accumulate and occlude the
outflow pathways. Loss of TM cells has been suspected to con-
tribute to aqueous humor outflow deficiencies and, conversely, it
has been hypothesized that replacing lost cells can restore function
to the eye (39). Previous studies by this and other laboratories have
indicated that either multipotent cells isolated from the TM (40,
41) or iPSC may be useful for this purpose (23, 42). Indeed, re-
cently published data have indicated that iPSC can restore some
functional aspects in an organ culture system. Our study demon-
strates that TM-like cells, derived from iPSC, can functionally
rescue a glaucoma phenotype in mice. These studies were aided to
a large degree by the availability of the myocilin mouse model of
glaucoma. As previously described, these transgenic animals ex-
press a pathogenic form of human myocilin, which causes endo-
plasmic reticulum stress, TM cellular dysfunction, and cell loss
(24). However, the anterior segment, including the TM, develops
normally in these mice and disturbances in aqueous humor outflow
dynamics only become apparent as the animals age. Importantly,
similar to human POAG, the pathophysiological events leading to
reduced aqueous humor outflow are not associated with gross
morphological disruption of the aqueous humor drainage struc-
tures, as is the case in many surgically induced models or those
resulting from congenital anterior segment malformation (33, 43).
Thus, we reasoned that the TM in these mice will be amenable to
restoration. For the reported studies 4-mo-old recipient animals
were chosen. At this age, the first signs of a disturbance in the
aqueous humor dynamics become apparent in some individuals,
including modest elevation of IOP and decreased outflow facility.
In untreated mice, the symptoms worsen over the next few weeks
and, at the age of 6 mo, the vast majority of transgenic mice de-
velop mildly elevated IOP, significantly reduced aqueous humor
outflow facility, and a clear reduction in TM cellularity.
Our data demonstrate that transplantation of iPSC-TM into the
eyes of 4-mo-old Tg-MYOCY437H mice prevents the development of
elevated IOP and preserves normal aqueous humor normal outflow
facility for at least 9 wk. This effect cannot be achieved through
transplantation of fibroblasts. These cells would represent a conve-
nient source of patient-derived material and secrete growth factors,
such as EGF and PDGF, that stimulate TM cell proliferation (44,
45). Furthermore, fibroblasts closely resemble mesenchymal stromal
cells that have shown promise in laser-induced models of glaucoma
(46, 47). Our findings indicate that these cells are not inert and
improve TM function to some degree. However, a statistically

 significant rescue effect cannot be demonstrated. Importantly
the prevention of RGC loss, which is the ultimate cause of vi-
sion loss in glaucoma, can only be demonstrated in iPSC-TM
treated eyes.
Immunohistochemical evaluation of the anterior segment of
treated and control eyes revealed that transplanted iPSC-TM
frequently become established in the TM of recipient eyes and
survive for at least 12 wk. Transplanted cells were also observed in
other tissues of the anterior segment, in particular the iris and
corneal endothelium, but this did not noticeably impair these
tissues. Furthermore, whereas early transplantation attempts using
iPSC-TM populations containing small amounts of cells retaining
expression of SSEA-1 frequently led to the formation of ocular
tumors, the scrupulous removal of any such cells prove to be a
viable and safe approach.
In the adult eye, TM cells do not proliferate under normal cir-
cumstances. One possible scenario how iPSC-TM might achieve
functional restoration of the TM may be that the transplanted cells
establish themselves within the tissue and carry out functions typ-
ically carried out by the endogenous cells. It is conceivable that, at
least in part, this is also the case here. However, although we ob-
served a strikingly higher TM cell density in transplanted eyes
compared with control eyes, the majority of these additional cells
are not iPSC-TM, but are derived through division of the recipient
eyes’ endogenous TM cells. Thus, a significant benefit of iPSC-TM
transplantation is that this process causes endogenous TM cells to
re-enter the cell cycle and replace previously lost cells. Accordingly,
we detect increased expression of a number of genes associated
with cellular division in eyes having received iPSC-TM. This pro-
liferation-enhancing effect of iPSC-TM can also be demonstrated
in vitro. Coculture of pTM cells with iPSC-TM results in signifi-
cantly higher proliferation rates than those observed in pTM alone.
Although the mechanism remains currently unresolved, our data
demonstrate that it requires cell–cell contact as coculture of phys-
ically separated iPSC-TM, and pTM does not replicate the effect.
It is interesting to note that earlier studies examining the phys-
iological consequences of laser trabeculoplasty, a treatment ap-
proach using mild laser stimulation of the TM, had also noted an
increase in the number of TM cells in the treated areas that the
investigators had speculated might be the cause of improved
aqueous humor outflow (21, 22). The newly derived TM cells are
derived from a population of progenitor cells located directly be-
neath the Schwalbe’s line that are suspected to resemble stem cells
(48). It is intriguing to speculate whether the endogenous TM cells
re-entering the cell cycle following iPSC-TM transplantation be-
long to this particular TM cell subtype. On the other hand, the
normally postmitotic TM cells of the adult eye retain some pro-
liferative properties and readily divide in vitro. Thus, it is con-
ceivable that iPSC-TM–mediated signaling removes proliferative
inhibition and causes cell division in vivo.
Although these studies are very encouraging, a number of
questions remain. For example, because the functional restoration
appears to depend upon proliferation of endogenous TM cells,
which also express MYOCY437H, it is possible that these newly
derived cells are themselves eventually lost resulting in a gradual
return of outflow dysfunction. Although in theory eyes can be
retreated with iPSC-TM, the influence of advanced age is currently
unclear. It is conceivable that this approach is less successful in very
old eyes. These considerations may be less of a concern in cases of
open angle glaucoma that are not the result of this very aggressive
mutation, because TM cell loss typically occurs over many decades
and, assuming similar rates of cell loss, newly derived TM cells may
survive for many years. However, additional studies will have to be
carried out to determine whether this approach can be successfully
used to reverse aqueous humor outflow deficiencies in other ani-
mal models or in other types of glaucoma. We are confident that
the TM cell loss exhibited in our mouse model shares many im-
portant features with general POAG. Other types of glaucoma
(e.g., that associated with pseudoexfoliation syndrome) result from
dissimilar damage to the TM, and it will be interesting to de-
termine if our approach will also be beneficial in these cases.

 Mice. Tg-MYOCY437H breeder mice were maintained on a C57BL/6J back-
ground. Experimental animals were generated by crosses between these and
SJL/J mice and only F1 animals were used.
Generation and Differentiation of iPSC. Mouse iPSC were generated by
reprogramming fifth passage fibroblasts of 6-wk-old transgenic mice expressing
the marker protein dsRed [B6.Cg-Tg(ACTB-DsRed*MST)1Nagy/J, Jackson Labo-
ratory] using a set of ecotropic retrovirus (mouse OKSM), as described previously
(49, 50). Mouse iPSC were cultured on 0.2% matrigel coated plates in mouse iPSC
media [DEME/F12, 15% (vol/vol) heat-inactivated FBS, 1% NEAA, 1% L-glutamine,
1% Pen/Strep, 0.2% Fungizone, 0.0008% BME], which was exchanged daily.
Mouse iPSC were differentiated through culture in media preconditioned by
human pTM. Briefly, human pTM were isolated from the TM of donor eyes, as
described previously (51) and cultured in Biopsy media (MEM-α, 10% inactivated
FBS, 0.2% primocin). The media conditioned by these pTM was collected daily,
pooled, and sterilized by filtration through MCE membrane filters (0.2-μm pore
size; Millipore). Sterilized conditioned media was used to induce iPSC to differen-
tiate once the confluency of iPSC reached 5% and the media was exchanged daily.
Induction of CLANs. Mouse iPSC were differentiated for 14 d and then exposed
with 100 nM Dex for 3 d. Control cells were treated with 1% ethanol (vehicle
control). Cells were stained with Alexa Fluor 647 Phalloidin and 16 100× images
were taken from each sample. Nuclei of all iPSC-TM forming CLANs, defined as
cytoskeletal structures as geodesic dome-like polygonal lattices in dome-shaped
cells, were counted and compared with the fraction of all iPSC-TM present.
Purification of iPSC-TM. Following 14 d of differentiation, 107 cells were tryp-
sinized, resuspended and incubated with magnetic microbeads conjugated to
SSEA-1 (CD15) antibodies (Miltenyi Biotec). Cells were washed and loaded into
a MACS LD column placed in the magnetic separator (Miltenyi Biotec). See SI
Materials and Methods for details.
iPSC Transplantation. Mice were deep anesthetized using a ketamine/xylazine
mixture (87.5 mg/kg ketamine and 12.5 mg/kg xylazine). Next, 50,000 iPSC-TM in
3 μL PBS were injected into the anterior chamber through the cornea in the
limbal region using 33-gauge half-inch stainless steel needles. Immediately before
injection, a small amount of aqueous humor was allowed to escape to accom-
modate the injected volume. An equal volume of PBS was injected in the control
group. GenTeal Severe Dry Eye Relief Lubricant was applied on the surface of the
cornea after the injections to avoid excessive drying during the anesthesia.
IOP Measurements. IOP was measured between 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM using a
rebound tonometer (TonoLab, Colonial Medical Supply). Mice were anesthetized
by 2.5% (wt/vol) isoflurane plus 80% (vol/vol) oxygen for 5 min before IOP
measurements, as described previously (52). IOP data were collected in a double-
blind manner from all animals.
Aqueous Humor Outflow Facility Measurement. Measurements were carried out
in live mice using approaches similar to those described previously (53–55). Mice
were deep-anesthetized and the anterior chamber was cannulated with a 33-
gauge stainless-steel needle connected to a flow-through pressure transducer
(IcuMedical). A 100-μL Hamilton syringe containing 0.9% saline was loaded in a
programmable pump. Data from the pressure transducer is transferred to a
computer and analyzed by HemoLab software (Stauss Scientific). The software
also controls the syringe pump and adjusts the pump rates to achieve the
desired pressures. Rates were recorded at 15 mmHg, 25 mmHg, and 35 mmHg
IOP for at least 7 min each (Fig. S3). Average flow rates for each pressure were
determined and used to calculate the aqueous humor outflow facility, defined
as microliter per minute per millimeter of mercury. Data were only considered
acceptable if a stable measurement was attained at all pressure steps and a r2
value > 0.95 was reached. To minimize the number of manipulations carried
out on each eye, not all transplanted eyes were assessed at all time points.
Immunohistochemistry. Cells were grown on coverslips and fixed in 4% (wt/vol)
paraformaldehyde for 20 min. Animal tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
for 4 h, embedded in OCT, frozen, and sectioned to 10-μm thickness on a cryostat.
See SI Materials and Methods for additional details.
Morphometric Studies. To count dsRed iPSC-TM cells and endogenous TM cells in
vivo, anterior chambers were sectioned to 10-μm thickness. TM tissues were
identified by collagen IV immunoreactivity (Abcam) and iPSC-TM cells were la-
beled with dsRed antibody (Santa Cruz). Nuclei were stained using 0.1 μg/mL
DAPI (Life Technologies). For each sample, nuclei of iPSC-TM cells and endoge-
nous TM cells from nine sections were counted and the numbers were averaged.
To determine RGC density, eyes were enucleated and retinas were carefully
dissected. Retinas were incubated overnight with antibodies directed against
γ-synuclein (Abnova). After several rinses and the application of donkey anti-
mouse secondary antibody (Life Technologies), retinas were whole-mounted.
Eight 40× images each representing an area of 318 × 318 μm2 were taken at
predetermined locations representing the whole retina. RGC were counted in
each image and data were averaged. One caveat of this approach is that only
γ-synuclein RGC are identified.
In Vitro Studies. Mouse pTM were transfected with adenoviral vectors expressing
either a pathogenic form of human myocilin (Ad5RSVmyocilinY437HHisFlag)
or empty Ad5CMV (control). The effects of cell–cell contact with iPSC-TM and
pTM was determined by seeding 50,000 purified iPSC-TM cells in transwell in-
serts above 50,000 mouse pTM. Alternatively, 50,000 mouse pTM were main-
tained in the presence of 50,000 iPSC-TM. The number of surviving cells was
determined using flow cytometry analysis.
For proliferation studies, mouse pTM were infected with Ad5RSV-
myocilinY437HHisFlag as above and grown in the presence of 10 μM BrdU for
2 h. BrdU incorporation was detected by immunohistochemistry. The ex-
periment was carried out in triplicate. See SI Materials and Methods for
additional details.
Global Gene Expression Analysis. For global transcriptional analysis of mouse
anterior segments, tissue was harvested from treated and control eyes 12 wk
after transplantation. Samples were hybridized to Affymetrix mouse 430 2.0
microarrays using standard Affymetrix protocols, as described previously (56).
For subsequent analysis, data from mice having received either PBS or fibro-
blast injections were grouped and compared with those derived from iPSC-TM
recipients. Cut-off values of 1.5 fold-change in expression levels and P < 0.01
were chosen. These data were grouped into clusters using AutoSOME and the
biological function of clusters was determined by the Panther Classification
System. See SI Materials and Methods for additional details.
Statistical Analysis. Student’s t test was used for statistical evaluation between
two groups. P values < 0.05 were considered to be significant throughout
this investigation.
Study Approval. All animal experimentation was carried out in accordance with
the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (57) and all pro-
tocols were reviewed and approved by the University of Iowa committee on
Animal Care and Use.
