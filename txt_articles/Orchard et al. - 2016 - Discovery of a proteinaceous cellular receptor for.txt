Noroviruses (NoVs) are a leading cause of gastroenteritis globally, yet the host factors
required for NoV infection are poorly understood. We identified host molecules that
are essential for murine NoV (MNoV)–induced cell death, including CD300lf as a
proteinaceous receptor. We found that CD300lf is essential for MNoV binding and
replication in cell lines and primary cells. Additionally, Cd300lf−/− mice are resistant
to MNoV infection. Expression of CD300lf in human cells breaks the species barrier
that would otherwise restrict MNoV replication. The crystal structure of the CD300lf
ectodomain reveals a potential ligand-binding cleft composed of residues that
are critical for MNoV infection. Therefore, the presence of a proteinaceous receptor
is the primary determinant of MNoV species tropism, whereas other components
of cellular machinery required for NoV replication are conserved between
humans and mice.
N
oroviruses (NoVs) are nonenveloped
positive-sense RNA viruses (1, 2). Because
of the strict species tropism of viruses in
the NoV genus and the lack of robust rep-
lication of human norovirus (HNoV) in
animal models, murine norovirus (MNoV) has
emerged as a model system to uncover basic
mechanisms of NoV biology in vitro and in vivo
(1, 3–8). MNoV can establish persistent enteric
infection, enabling studies of the interplay be-
tween viral persistence, resident enteric micro-
organisms, and the host immune system (4–6).
The capacity of HNoV and MNoV to bind cells
and the susceptibility of humans to HNoV have
been linked to expression of cell-surface and
secreted carbohydrates (1, 9–13), whereas another
member of the Caliciviridae family uses a pro-
teinaceous receptor (14, 15). Host factors, including
receptors required for NoV infection and patho-
genesis, have largely defied molecular identifica-
tion; their discovery would aid in understanding
mechanisms of NoV replication, vaccination, spe-
cies tropism, and enteric viral persistence. To
identify host molecules required for MNoV in-
fection, we undertook an unbiased forward ge-
netic approach (fig. S1).
MNoV replicates and induces cell death in
murine macrophage-like cells, including the mi-
croglial BV2 cell line, allowing the identification
of genes essential for MNoV replication by means
of CRISPR-Cas9 technology. We introduced four
independent genome-wide subpools of single-
guide RNAs (sgRNAs) from the murine Asiago
library into BV2 cells stably expressing Cas9 and
then infected the cells with MNoV strains that
either cause acute systemic infection (MNoV CW3)
or persistent enteric infection (MNoVCR6) (16–18).
sgRNA sequences from the surviving cells were
sequenced and analyzed using the STARS gene-
ranking algorithm (Fig. 1A) (17). sgRNAs target-
ing Cd300lf (CLM-1, CMRF35, MAIR-V, and LMIR3),
a gene that encodes a cell-surface immunoglobulin
(Ig) domain–containing molecule within a family
of proteins involved in binding lipids, were most
significantly enriched for both MNoV strains
(Fig. 1A and tables S1 to S3) (19). We generated
two independent BV2DCD300lf clones (where
the delta signifies disruption of the Cd300lf gene);
the growth of MNoVCW3 and MNoV CR6 was abol-
ished in both clones, whereas the replication of
other viruses was unaffected (Fig. 1B and fig. S2).
We also validated the importance of several
additional molecules that were predicted by our
screen to play a role in MNoV-induced cell death
(Fig. 1A and fig. S3). Taken together, these data
provide a systematic overview of the molecules
required for NoV replication in these cells.
We selected CD300lf for further analysis
because of its cell-surface expression and the
importance of viral receptors in conferring per-
missiveness for viral replication and species
tropism. Transfection of MNoVCW3 RNA into
BV2DCD300lf cells was sufficient to restore
MNoVCW3 production, demonstrating that
CD300lf is essential for viral entry (Fig. 2A).
Preincubation of cells with a polyclonal anti-
body targeting CD300lf (a-CD300lf) blocked
MNoVCW3-induced cytopathic effects in BV2
cells (Fig. 2B). Similarly, incubating MNoVCW3
with recombinant CD300lf ectodomain (sCD300lf)
neutralized MNoVCW3-induced cytopathic effects,
whereas annexin V or phosphoserine treatment
had no effect (Fig. 2C and fig. S4). Similar re-
sults were obtained for infection of the B cell line
M12, bone marrow–derived dendritic cells, and
bone marrow–derived macrophages, indicating

 not further inhibited by a-CD300lf or by pre-
mixing virus with sCD300lf (Fig. 2E). These re-
sults show that CD300lf mediates viral binding
and is a functional receptor for MNoV.
Previous reports have suggested that carbo-
hydrates facilitate the binding of MNoV and
HNoV to host cells and control the susceptibility
of humans to HNoV infection (1, 9–11). Therefore,
we assessed the relative contribution of carbo-
hydrates to MNoV attachment and infection. Un-
expectedly, mice deficient in Fut2, which controls
histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) secretor status,
had similar MNoV loads to those of wild-type
littermate controls (fig. S5A). Also, treating cells
with the mannosidase I inhibitor kifunensine sig-
nificantly reduced cell-surface carbohydrates but
did not significantly alter MNoV CW3 binding to
cells (fig. S5, B and C). These data suggest that,
within the sensitivity of these assays, MNoV
binding and infection are dependent on CD300lf
but not on protein-associated glycans or secretor
status.
In addition to CD300lf, we discovered that ef-
ficient MNoV binding to cells requires a cofactor
found in serum (Fig. 2F). The cofactor is present in
delipidated serum and is resistant to proteinase K
and heat denaturation (95°C; Fig. 2F). Size frac-
tionation of serum indicates that the cofactor is
present in fractions with an average molecular
weight of less than 5000 Da (Fig. 2F). Thus, the
serum cofactor is most likely a small nonproteina-
ceousheat-stablemoleculethatinteractswithMNoV
and/or CD300lf to facilitate cellular binding.
Next, we sought to assess the physiologic rel-
evance of MNoV and CD300lf interactions. MNoV
isolated from the spleens of MNoV CW3-infected
mice remained sensitive to sCD300lf inhibition,
indicating that sCD300lf neutralizes MNoV regard-
less of the source of the virus (Fig. 3A). To test the
role of CD300lf and MNoV interactions in vivo,
we incubated MNoVCW3 with either sCD300lf or
a control protein before infection of Stat1−/− mice,
which succumb to MNoVCW3 infection. In a dose-
dependent manner, sCD300lf preincubation was
able to protect from MNoV-induced lethality (Fig.
3, B and C). Last, we generated Cd300lf −/− mice
to test the in vivo role of CD300lf in MNoV infec-
tion. Cd300lf −/− mice were resistant to MNoVCR6
infection compared with littermate controls (Fig.
3D). These data demonstrate that CD300lf is the
primary physiological receptor for MNoV in vivo.
MNoV replicates in murine dendritic cells,
macrophages, and B cells, but not in epithelial
cells or human cells because of a restriction at
viral entry (20, 21). Therefore, we tested whether
expression of murine CD300lf was sufficient to
confer susceptibility of HeLa cells to MNoV. As
expected, HeLa cells transfected with a control
plasmid were unable to support MNoV replica-
tion (Fig. 4A). In contrast, HeLa cells expressing

 murine but not human CD300lf were susceptible
to MNoV (Fig. 4A). These results indicate that
CD300lf expression is sufficient for MNoV growth
in human cells and suggest that differences be-
tween human and murine CD300lf could con-
tribute to MNoV species restriction.
In mice, there are eight CD300 family members
(22). Therefore, we sought to determine whether
other CD300 molecules are capable of functioning
as MNoV receptors. After transfection into HeLa
cells, only CD300lf and CD300ld conferred sus-
ceptibility to MNoV, whereas the expression of
other CD300 family members or of the unrelated
phosphatidylserine binding protein TIM1 was un-
able to support MNoV infection (Fig. 4B and fig.
S6) (23). We further confirmed that expression of
CD300lf or CD300ld, but not CD300lh, was suf-
ficient for viral replication in human cells (Fig.
4A). However, in contrast to murine CD300lf, the
recombinant ectodomains of murine CD300ld,
murine CD300lh, or human CD300lf failed to
neutralize viral infection (Fig. 4C). Additionally,
BV2DCD300ld cells are susceptible to MNoV in-
fection, suggesting that CD300ld can act as a MNoV
receptor when ectopically expressed, but it is not
a universal requirement (fig. S7). However, we
cannot exclude the possibility that CD300ld may
play a role in viral tropism in some circumstances
in vivo. Experiments in Cd300l f −/− mice indi-
cate that this putative role is not essential for
intestinal infection or shedding.
We next sought to define the mechanism for
MNoV entry via CD300lf and to determine how
MNoV discriminates between mouse and human
CD300lf proteins. Importantly, the intracellular
domain of CD300lf was not required to make
HeLa cells susceptible, indicating that species
tropism is determined by the ectodomain (Fig. 4D).
We determined the crystal structure of the CD300lf
ectodomain at 1.6 Å resolution (Fig. 4E and table
S4). Densities corresponding to a bound Hepes
molecule, which was present in the purification
buffers, and a coordinated metal were visible
in a surface cleft formed between the CDR3 loop
and the b-hairpin turn that connects the C-C′
b-strands. CD300lf has been reported to mediate
the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells through the
calcium-dependent binding of lipids (24–26).
Hepes has chemical resemblance to a phospho-
lipid headgroup (fig. S8). Our structure also re-
veals a metal coordinated primarily by CD300lf
Asp98 and two CDR3 loop carbonyl oxygens. Al-
though mutation of murine CD300lf Asp98 has
been shown to disrupt apoptotic cell-surface
binding, this mutant still allows MNoVCW3 infec-
tion of HeLa cells, suggesting that viral entry can
occur in the absence of bound metal (Fig. 4D and
fig. S8) (25, 27). The Ig domains of murine and
human CD300lf share 59% sequence identity,
and structurally the largest variation occurs in
CDR3 and the CC′ loop (figs. S9 and S10) (27).
Individual substitutions of human CC′ loop and
CDR3 into murine CD300lf diminished and
abolished MNoV CW3 infection of HeLa cells,
respectively (Fig. 4, D and F). Additionally,
purified recombinant proteins harboring CC′ loop
and CDR3 human sequences failed to neutralize
MNoV infection (Fig. 4C and fig. S11). However,
the reciprocal CDR3 mutation (murine CDR3
into human CD300lf) was not sufficient for MNoV
infection (Fig. 4D). Independently comparing
murine CD300lf and CD300lh also indicated that
the CD300lf CC′ loop and CDR3 sequences are
necessary but not sufficient for receptor utiliza-
tion by MNoV (fig. S12). These data provide a
framework for understanding how MNoV dis-
criminates between CD300 family members.
Our work establishes that CD300lf is a func-
tional MNoV receptor that mediates binding to
the cell surface and is both necessary and suf-
ficient for viral entry and replication in vitro and
in vivo. Because MNoV serves as a model system
for understanding how viruses persist and shape
the immune system, the modulation of receptor
availability, either genetically or chemically, may
foster understanding of immunomodulation, per-
sistence, and tropism of MNoV. This work also
enables the future study of MNoV replication in
human cells, which may uncover novel mecha-
nisms of viral replication and pathogenesis and
allow a direct identification and mechanistic dis-
section of the cellular factors required for NoV
replication across species. Additionally, our work
has implications for understanding HNoV infec-
tions. HNoV binds to HBGA, and susceptibility to
HNoV is correlated with host HBGA status; the
studies that show this (12, 13) are the foundation
for the hypothesis that glycans are HNoV recep-
tors (9). However, HBGA alone cannot explain
species tropism or the entry barrier for HNoV. In
contrast, our data indicate that murine CD300lf
is sufficient to explain tropism for MNoV and
more broadly suggest the possibility that other
NoVs use proteinaceous receptors in addition to
small molecule cofactors that are present in
serum or other biological fluids. It is intriguing
that CD300 molecules can bind a range of host
lipids and bacterial products (22, 28). It may
therefore be that NoV cell and tissue tropism is
determined in a combinatorial fashion by pro-
teinaceous receptors interacting with permis-
siveness cofactors that are present at different sites.
