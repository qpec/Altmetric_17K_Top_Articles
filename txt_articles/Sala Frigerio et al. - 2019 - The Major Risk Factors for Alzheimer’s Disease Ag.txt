In Brief
Sala Frigerio et al. show how microglia
respond to amyloid-b, the Alzheimer’s
disease (AD)-causing factor. Their major
response, the ARMs response, is
enriched for AD risk genes, is abolished
by Apoe deletion, develops faster in
female mice, and is also part of normal
aging. Thus, major AD risk factors
converge on microglia.

SUMMARY
Gene expression profiles of more than 10,000 individ-
ual microglial cells isolated from cortex and hippo-
campus of male and female AppNL-G-F mice over
time demonstrate that progressive amyloid-b accu-
mulation accelerates two main activated microglia
states that are also present during normal aging. Acti-
vated response microglia (ARMs) are composed of
specialized subgroups overexpressing MHC type II
and putative tissue repair genes (Dkk2, Gpnmb, and
Spp1) and are strongly enriched with Alzheimer’s dis-
ease (AD) risk genes. Microglia from female mice
progress faster in this activation trajectory. Similar
activated states are also found in a second AD model
and in human brain. Apoe, the major genetic risk
factor for AD, regulates the ARMs but not the inter-
feron response microglia (IRMs). Thus, the ARMs
response is the converging point for aging, sex, and
genetic AD risk factors.
INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by typical biochemical
lesions (b-amyloid peptide [Ab] plaques and tau tangles) accom-
panied by extensive cellular changes (neuronal dystrophic alter-
ations, neuronal cell loss, astrogliosis, and microgliosis) (De
Strooper and Karran, 2016; Serrano-Pozo et al., 2011). Rare mu-
tations in amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin (PSEN) 1
and 2 (Karch et al., 2014), ADAM10 (Suh et al., 2013), and
ADAM17 (Hartl et al., 2018) trigger Ab plaque accumulation
and are sufficient to induce the full biochemical and morpholog-
ical signature of AD. While this clearly indicates a major role for
Ab in AD pathology (Jack et al., 2013; Selkoe and Hardy,
2016), even in these genetic forms, a decades-long asymptom-
atic phase is present (Bateman et al., 2012). Thus, in addition to
Ab plaques, other pathological processes, either in response to
or in parallel to Ab accumulation, need activation to cause neuro-
degenerative disease (De Strooper and Karran, 2016).
The search for the genetic risk determinants in sporadic AD
has highlighted the central role of non-neuronal genes in path-
ways that do not appear directly related to Ab metabolism (Cru-
chaga et al., 2014; Guerreiro et al., 2013; Lambert et al., 2013;
Marioni et al., 2018; Salih et al., 2018; Sims et al., 2017; Ville-
gas-Llerena et al., 2016). Most of the genes associated with
the �40 loci identified by genome-wide association (GWA) anal-
ysis or by rare variant sequencing studies are expressed in glial
cells (e.g., APOE, TREM2, BIN1, CD33, INPP5D, CTSB, CTSD,
and PICALM). Moreover, analysis of available single-cell tran-
scriptome datasets for human brain cells reported an associa-
tion between AD GWA signals and microglia as well as astro-
cytes (Calderon et al., 2017). Analysis of regulatory networks of
genes differentially expressed in AD patients indicates that im-
mune- and microglia-specific gene modules are key contributors
to AD pathology (Zhang et al., 2013). Thus, genetic and molecu-
lar evidence suggest that Ab accumulation is the trigger of a se-
ries of pathogenic processes in which microglia play a central
role. No consistent hypothesis, however, links the causality
implied by the mutations in the amyloid pathway genes to the ge-
netic risk linking sporadic AD to inflammatory pathways. This has
caused severe criticism on the amyloid cascade hypothesis for
AD, raising questions about its validity in sporadic AD (Behl
and Ziegler, 2017; Harrison and Owen, 2016; Herrup, 2015; Kar-
ran and Hardy, 2014; Makin, 2018; Selkoe and Hardy, 2016). One
possible resolution is that amyloid pathology acts only as a
trigger in sporadic AD (Karran et al., 2011); i.e., Ab accumulation
is necessary but insufficient to cause full-blown disease. The
cellular response, determined by the genetic makeup of the

 patients, tilts the table from a rather benign Ab proteopathy to the
severe neurodegeneration with inflammation and Tau pathology
that characterizes AD (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). In this re-
gard, further understanding of the microglia response to amyloid
pathology and the role of risk factors for AD in this response
is key.
Several groups have applied high-throughput single-cell ge-
nomics and proteomics methods to characterize the shift in mi-
croglial cell states after different kinds of insults (Friedman et al.,
2018; Hammond et al., 2019; Keren-Shaul et al., 2017; Mathys
et al., 2017; Mrdjen et al., 2018). In neurodegenerative settings,
microglia develop disease-associated phenotypes, such as
the microglial neurodegenerative phenotype (MGnD) (Krase-
mann et al., 2017) or the disease-associated microglia (DAMs)
(Keren-Shaul et al., 2017), but it is still an open question whether
different subsets of such phenotypes exist, whether there are
brain-area- or sex-specific differences in the microglial re-
sponses to Ab, and which are the roles of AD risk genes
expressed in microglia.
Here, we set out to address in a systematic way the question of
how microglia respond over time, in cortex and hippocampus, to
progressive Ab deposition and whether this is affected by the
three major risk factors for AD, i.e., age, sex, and genetics. We
use an App knockin mouse model (AppNL-G-F), which displays
progressive amyloidosis and microgliosis while avoiding overex-
pression of APP via artificial promotors (Masuda et al., 2016;
Saito et al., 2014; Sasaguri et al., 2017) (Figure 1A). We show
that the microglial responses to Ab pathology are complex but,
surprisingly, largely reproducible cell states that are also appear-
ing during normal aging, albeit slower and quantitatively more
limited. Moreover, we show that microglia in female mice tend
to react earlier and in a more pronounced way than microglia
in male mice, particularly in older mice. Interestingly, the major
response of microglia to amyloid pathology is enriched for AD
risk genes, with Apoe expression, in particular, becoming highly
upregulated. This is partially confirmed in human tissue. Analysis
of microglia from an Apoenull AD mouse model showed that the
main Ab response is severely impaired in the absence of Apoe.
RESULTS
We analyzed cortical and hippocampal microglia in female and
male C57BL/6J wild-type and in AppNL-G-F mice at four different
time points: at the beginning of Ab deposition (3 months old
[m.o.]), at the beginning of overt histologically detectable micro-
gliosis (6 m.o.), when both processes are well underway
(12 m.o.), and at a late stage (21 m.o.) (Masuda et al., 2016) (Fig-
ure 1A). All together, we analyzed 32 different experimental con-
ditions, taking into consideration the combinations of genotype,
age, sex, and tissue (Figure 1A).
Tissue and cell suspensions were kept at <4�C during all steps
of the isolation of microglia, to minimize artifactual activation (see
STAR Methods). We isolated single live microglial cells (Cd11b+/
DAPI�) by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (Figure S1)
and prepared single-cell full-length mRNA-sequencing libraries,
using a modified SmartSeq2 method (Picelli et al., 2013, 2014;
Trombetta et al., 2014) (see Figure 1A and STAR Methods). We
sequenced a total of 12,024 single cells across the different
experimental conditions. After quality control and removal of
peripheral neutrophils (see Figure S2A and STAR Methods), we
retained 10,801 microglial cells for further analysis.
Aging and Ab Deposition Induce Similar Responses in
Microglia
We next performed clustering analysis (see STAR Methods),
which resulted in the identification of 6 major subpopulations
of microglia (Figure 1B), displaying different abundances be-
tween genotypes and age groups (Figure 1C).
Two clusters expressing high levels of known homeostatic mi-
croglia markers (Tmem119, P2ry12, and Cx3cr1; Figure 1D) (Bu-
tovsky et al., 2014) dominated the whole microglial population
(homeostatic 1 microglia and homeostatic 2 microglia; H1Ms
and H2Ms, respectively; Figure 1B). In wild-type mice, H1Ms
and H2Ms together accounted for 80%–90% of the total micro-
glial population. They were roughly equally large at every time
point, although H2Ms decreased by �10% in 21-m.o. mice (Fig-
ure 1C). In AppNL-G-F mice, both H1Ms and H2Ms were equally
(>40% of all microglia each) represented at 3 months but then
showed a drastic decrease with age over the course of pa-
thology, particularly H2Ms (Figures 1C and S3A). Thus, H2Ms
seem to be more sensitive to aging and amyloid pathology
than H1Ms. H1Ms and H2Ms display subtle differences in
expression of more than 700 genes, with statistically significant
fold changes of 1.1–1.5 in either direction. While no clear gene
expression signature differentiates the two subsets, genes
such as C1qa, C1qb, C1qc, Ctsb, Ctsd, Fth1, and Lyz2 were
significantly upregulated in H2Ms. Therefore, the cluster of
H2Ms, although displaying a canonical homeostatic gene
tissue, genotype) was pooled before microglia isolation. All procedures were performed on ice. Single live microglial cells were isolated by FACS (CD11b+,
DAPI�), and single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) libraries were prepared according to the SmartSeq2 and Nextera methods.

inflammation markers (Cst7) and concurrently display a reduction of homeostatic markers (P2ry12). Two distinct regions of the ARMs cluster display increased
expression of MHC class II genes (H2-Aa, H2-Ab1, and Cd74), suggesting the existence of microglial subpopulations. Further, a small subset of the ARMs cluster
displays an enrichment for tissue repair genes (Spp1, Gpnmb, and Dkk2). The ARMs cluster also displays differential expression of several AD-related genes (e.g.,
Ctsb, Bin1, and Pld3) compared to clusters of H1Ms and H2Ms. The cluster of IRMs is enriched for interferon genes (Ifit3, Oasl2, and Irf7).

 expression profile, seems more primed toward synapse pruning
and heightened lysosomal activity and might therefore engage
faster into more activated states. Interestingly, the clusters of
H1Ms and H2Ms display a differential distribution relative to
sex and tissue groups (Figures S3A–S3D). Therefore, our data
uncover previously unrecognized heterogeneity in homeostatic
microglia.
The other clusters were quite divergent from the homeostatic
ones (Figure 1D). One cluster (ARMs; Figure 1B) increased
strongly in the AppNL-G-F mice. It is characterized by the expres-
sion of gene sets involved in inflammatory processes (Cst7,
Clec7a, and Itgax), in major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
class II presentation (Cd74, H2-Ab1, H2-Aa, Ctsb, and Ctsd),
and possibly involved in tissue regeneration (Spp1, Gpnmb,
and Dkk2) (Figures 1D and 1E). A second cluster (TRMs; transit-
ing response microglia; Figure 1B) has an overall transcriptomic
profile similar to that of the ARMs cluster but had lower expres-
sion levels of Apoe and other inflammatory genes, particularly of
MHC class II genes, while it did not express tissue regeneration
genes (Figures 1D and 1E). A third cluster (IRMs [interferon
response microglia]; Figure 1B) displayed a high expression of
several genes involved in innate immune response and interferon
response type I pathways (e.g., Ifit2, Ifit3, Ifitm3, Irf7, and Oasl2),
which were otherwise not expressed in other clusters (Figures
1D and 1E). Finally, we identified a very small cluster of cells cor-
responding to 0.3%–1.2% of the total microglial pool (CPMs,
cycling/proliferating microglia) (Figures 1B and 1C) that was
enriched in genes involved in DNA replication, chromatin rear-
rangement, and cell cycle (e.g., Top2a, Mcm2, Tubb5, Mki67,
and Cdk1) (Figure 1D). The cluster of CPMs did not display any
selective enrichment for specific phenotypic groups (Figure 1C
and S3A–S3D) and may represent a small pool of cycling micro-
glia (Askew et al., 2017).
The proportion of cells in the clusters of reactive microglia
(ARMs, TRMs, and IRMs) increased over age in both AppNL-G-F
and wild-type mice (Figures 1C and S3A–S3D). Importantly,
each cluster is present even in young wild-type mice (all together
constituting 5.5% of the total wild-type microglia at 3 m.o.; Fig-
ure 1C), demonstrating that these clusters are physiological
states of microglia. Although amyloid pathology does not induce
a unique pathological microglial state in this animal model, there
is, however, a very outspoken quantitative effect on the ARMs
cluster, with 87% of the microglia in this cluster coming from
AppNL-G-F mice. The number of ARMs increased 5-fold (6% to
33%) between 3 and 6 months, and by 12 months, they were
the major type of microglia (52%) in the AppNL-G-F mice, outnum-
bering the two homeostatic clusters. ARMs are, nevertheless,
also increasing with aging in wild-type mice, reaching 12% of
the total number of microglia at 21 months of age (Figure 1C).
IRMs were present at a low percentage in both wild-type and
AppNL-G-F mice, but their number increased over aging, particu-
larly in AppNL-G-F mice (Figures 1C and S3A). Thus, aging alone
induces transcriptome changes leading to two subtypes of acti-
vated microglia (ARMs and IRMs), and Ab deposition enhances
both cell states significantly.
Microglia Differentiate into Mutually Exclusive
Response States
We wondered whether the different responses represented
separate differentiation fates or consecutive steps on a contin-
uous differentiation trajectory. Semi-supervised pseudotime
analysis with Monocle 2 (Qiu et al., 2017a, 2017b; Trapnell
et al., 2014) aligned microglial cells along a two-branched trajec-
tory (Figure 2A). By identifying the distribution of cells from each
cluster along these three branches, it becomes evident that ho-
meostatic microglial cells (state 1) progressed either toward
a state corresponding to the interferon-based IRMs response
(state 2) or to a state corresponding to the heterogeneous
ARMs response (state 3) (Figure 2A). This is quantitatively repre-
sented in Figure 2B, showing that 86% of homeostatic microglia
(H1Ms and H2Ms) were retrieved in state 1, while 90% of
the interferon response cells from the cluster of IRMs were in
state 2, and 93% of the main Ab-responsive ARMs cluster cells
were in state 3 (Figure 2B; Figure S4). Cells from the cluster of
TRMs were distributed between state 1 (36%) and state 3
(63%) (Figure 2B; Figure S4), further suggesting that this cluster
represents cells transitioning between the two stages. The few
cells in the cluster of CPMs were mostly found in state 1 (54%;
43 cells) but were represented also in state 2 (18%; 14 cells)
and state 3 (28%; 22 cells) (Figure 2B; Figure S4).
Remarkably, Apoe expression continually increases along
pseudotime in the ARMs (state 3) branch, together with several
inflammatory markers (e.g., Cst7) (Figure 2C). MHC class II
genes (e.g., H2-Ab1 and Cd74) were predominantly expressed
by cells toward mid-to-late pseudotime in the ARMs (state 3)
branch (Figure 2C). Genes involved with tissue repair (e.g.,
Spp1 and Dkk2) were expressed only by cells at the farthest
end of the ARMs (state 3) branch (Figure 2C), which also ex-
pressed the highest Apoe levels, indicating that this subpop-
ulation represents an advanced evolution of the microglial

 response. Most (94%) of these cells are derived from the
AppNL-G-F mice. Although Apoe is also expressed in some inter-
feron response (state 2) branch cells, its expression levels were
lower compared to those in state 3 cells (Figure 2C), in agree-
ment with differential expression analysis conducted at the clus-
ter level (discussed earlier).
Differential expression analysis did not yield tissue- or sex-
specific responses (Figures S3E and S3F), indicating that micro-
glial responses to Ab deposition is actuated stereotypically in
hippocampus and cortex. Interestingly, female microglia dis-
played a faster progression in the deployment of the ARMs
response in 6 m.o. AppNL-G-F and onward (Figures 2D–2G),
which is reflected by the higher proportion of female ARMs cells
compared to that of males (Figure S3B). Thus, although the
response types and the genes involved are conserved between
the two sexes, microglia in female mice appear to react earlier
to Ab.
ARMs Display Distinct Subpopulations Enriched for
GWAS AD Risk Genes
Strikingly, Apoe, the main genetic risk factor for AD (Corder
et al., 1993; Lambert et al., 2013), is strongly upregulated in
ARMs, representing the major Ab-response population (Figures
1D and 1E). Therefore, we wondered whether other AD risk
genes are enriched among the genes that are differentially ex-
pressed (both up and down) in each of the reactive microglial
clusters, compared to homeostatic microglia, using gene set
enrichment analysis (GSEA) (Mootha et al., 2003; Subramanian
et al., 2005). We used a list of genes associated with family his-
tory of AD from a recent extensive GWA study (GWAS) (Marioni
et al., 2018). Taking into account that recent studies on poly-
genic risk scores show that genes with no genome-wide signif-
icance in GWASs still carry information with regard to risk of AD
(Escott-Price et al., 2017), we decided to test for enrichment of
GWAS genes at a number of different p value cutoffs (Fig-
ure 3A). For all tested p value cutoffs (ranging from p < 1e�6
to p < 0.01), only the ARMs cluster shows a strong enrichment
for GWAS-associated AD genes (between p < 1e�6 and p <
0.005), suggesting that polygenic risk associates with the
ARMs cell state. The GSEA algorithm yields a set of GWAS
genes most responsible for the observed enrichment (which
we refer to as the GWAS core enrichment genes). In our
case, using the set with the strongest enrichment (p < 1e�5),
these genes are the well-established AD risk genes Apoe,
H2-Eb1, Inpp5d, Bin1, and Ms4a6b but also Siglech (or
CD33) and H2-Ab1, which have been suggested to be associ-
ated with AD (Lambert et al., 2013). Interestingly, Siglech,
Inpp5d, Bin1, and Ms4a6b were significantly downregulated
in the ARMs cluster, while the others were significantly upregu-
lated. Further work is needed to determine whether these
changes act in a protective or harmful way, but it is known
that a SNP in the Siglech locus suppressing CD33 expression
is protective in AD (Griciuc et al., 2013), while a SNP increasing
its expression also increases AD risk (Bradshaw et al., 2013).
We further looked specifically at the expression level (Figure S5)
of a list of AD-related genes (Table S2) compiled from an exten-
sive literature review. The expression levels of cathepsins Ctsb
and Ctsd, Trem2 and Tyrobp, H2-Eb1, Pld3, and Aplp2 were all
significantly upregulated in the ARMs cluster, while Adam10,
Bin1, Cass4, Cd33, Ctsf, Inpp5d, Ms4a6d, and Picalm showed
decreased expression in the same cluster (Figure S5).
We next investigated the genes upregulated in the ARMs
cluster relative to the homeostatic cluster in bulk tissue from
human brains obtained from the Accelerating Medicines Part-
nership-AD (AMP-AD) portal (Hodes and Buckholtz, 2016). 62
of the top 100 genes upregulated in the ARMs cluster were
also significantly (adjusted p < 0.05) upregulated in subjects
with high plaque burden (Consortium to Establish a Registry
for AD [CERAD] stage C3) compared to the stage-C0 subjects.
The parahippocampal region from the Mount Sinai Brain Bank
(MSBB) cohort region had the highest number of differentially
expressed genes, with TREM2, ITGAX, and CD74 displaying
the highest effect sizes (Figure 3D). Some of the GSEA core
enrichment genes were also significantly upregulated in C3
subjects: HLA-DRB5, HLA-DQA1, and HLA-DQB1 (orthologs
of H2-Eb1 and H2-Ab1) (Figure 3D). We then sought to deter-
mine whether these expression changes due to plaque in-
crease were independent of the presence of tangles. To test
this hypothesis, we analyzed gene expression between sub-
jects with different plaque load and without tangles (Braak
stages 0, I, and II), the human conditions most analogous to
AppNL-G-F mice. The top genes that increased with plaque
mean score were TREM2, TYROBP, and CD68 in the MSBB
parahippocampal dataset, with TREM2 displaying a 2.7-fold in-
crease (p = 0.2 , 10�4).
As indicated earlier, the ARMs from AppNL-G-F mice do not
appear as one homogeneous cluster. Therefore, we assessed
whether we could further subdivide the ARMs cells. In Figure 3B,
we visualized the signature score (see STAR Methods) for the up-
regulated GWAS core enrichment genes, showing two sub-clus-
ters within the ARMs cluster (labeled ‘‘A’’ and ‘‘B’’ in Figure 3B).
Both subclusters are highly enriched (96%) for AppNL-G-F cells,
suggesting that these particular subsets of ARMs might consti-
tute specific responses to Ab accumulation. The ARMs A sub-
cluster expresses typical ARMs genes, along with genes
possibly involved in tissue repair and remyelination, e.g., Spp1
(osteopontin, a chemoattractant and an adhesion protein
involved in wound healing), Gpnmb (osteoactivin, involved in
extracellular matrix remodelling), and Dkk2 (a secreted Wnt
pathway antagonist) (Figure 1E). The ARMs B subcluster ex-
presses Tmem119 but no genes overexpressed by other
ARMs (e.g., Spp1, Lpl, Gpnmb, Apoe, Clec7a, and Cst7) (Fig-
ure 1E). Thus, in AppNL-G-F mice, Ab boosts the heterogeneous
ARMs response, with a gene signature that is enriched with AD
risk genes, and elements of which can be retrieved in human
subjects displaying a high plaque load.
Apoe-Expressing Microglia Cluster around b-Amyloid
Plaques
We were particularly intrigued by the high expression of Apoe in
ARMs. As Apoe is mainly expressed by astrocytes in non-path-
ological conditions, we wondered whether astrocytes would
also increase Apoe expression upon exposure to Ab plaques.
We performed single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybrid-
ization (smFISH) with RNAscope probes against Apoe and
Itgam or Slc1a3 to mark microglia and astrocytes, respectively.

expressed in each of the three reactive microglial clusters (IRMs, TRMs, and ARMs) compared to the homeostatic microglia (H1Ms + H2Ms), calculated using
GSEA. A significant enrichment indicates that more AD GWAS genes than expected are found among genes most strongly affected in the differential expression
analysis for each comparison. We tested a number of different AD GWAS sets using different p value cutoffs: the numbers in the parentheses indicate the number
of genes for that specific cutoff. The numbers in the bars indicate the size of the GSEA-predicted leading edge (core enrichment genes), which can be interpreted
as the genes responsible for the observed enrichment. The enrichment for the p < 1e�5 cutoff yielded the lowest padj.
(B and C) Of the 7 core enrichment genes for the p < 1e�5 cutoff, 3 (Apoe, H2-Ab1, and H2-Eb1) were upregulated in ARMs compared to homeostatic microglia,
while 4 genes (Siglech, Inpp5d, Bin1, and Ms4a6b) were downregulated. For each set of up- and downregulated core enrichment genes, we calculated a
signature score (i.e., a composite expression score of a set of genes) using Seurat’s AddModuleScore function. Each cell’s score for either the upregulated (B) or
downregulated (C) gene set is visualized on a t-SNE plot (as in Figure 1B). In both cases, cells of the two genotypes are plotted separately, as indicated in the titles,
with cells of the other genotype plotted in gray. In (B), the AppNL-G-F cells clearly display a strong signature score for AD GWAS genes showing in the ARMs cluster.
The two green arrowheads on the left in (B) indicate two areas with particularly strong expression of these genes.

(Alzheimer’s disease) versus C0 comparisons are displayed next to the gene names. Similar results were found in the ROSMAP dataset (data not shown).

 smFISH was coupled with immunofluorescent detection of Ab
plaques using 6E10 antibody (Figures 4A–4F). Itgam and
Apoe signals strongly colocalized in cells associated with pla-
ques, while this was rare in cells located further away from pla-
ques (Figures 4A, 4B, and 4G). Staining with the astrocyte
marker Slc1a3 (Figures 4D and 4E) confirmed that astrocytes,
but no microglia, were expressing Apoe in wild-type mice (Fig-
ures 4C and 4F).
We quantified the intensity of Apoe staining in microglia and
astrocytes at different distances from plaques. The intensity of
Apoe staining gradually increased in both cell types when closer
to plaques, but the increase was much higher in microglia than in
astrocytes (Figure 3G). Microglia, furthermore, were clustered
around Ab plaques, while astrocytes were evenly distributed
across the tissue (Figure 4H).
These results indicate that microglia constitute the main
cellular response close to plaques and that ApoE production at
plaques is mainly of microglial origin. We did not see an increase
of cycling cells (cluster of CPMs) in AppNL-G-F mice, suggesting
that the increased number of microglia next to plaques is not
due to increased proliferation and represents likely the evolution
of microglia from homeostatic H1 and H2 to reactive ARMs cell
states in AppNL-G-F.
Deletion of Apoe Suppresses the Microglial Response
to b-Amyloid
We wondered whether Apoe was directly involved in the micro-
glial responses to Ab pathology. An Apoenull mouse strain is not
available on an AppNL-G-F background at this moment; there-
fore, we used a second AD mouse model (APP/PS1) for which
an Apoenull strain has been recently developed (APP/PS1-
Apoenull; [E.H., J. Klickstein, C. Cannavo, R. Jackson, A. Muzi-
kansky, S. Gandhi, D. Urick, T. Sargent, L. Wrobleski, A.D. Roe,
S., Hou, K.V. Kuchibhotla, R.A. Betensky, T. Spires-Jones, B.T.
Hyman, unpublished data]). We sequenced 2,304 single cells
from 18-m.o. male APP/PS1 and APP/PS1-Apoenull mice and
from the respective control strains, C57BL/6J and C57BL/
6J-Apoenull. After quality control and removal of peripheral
neutrophils (Figure S6), we retained 1,880 microglial cells for
further analysis. Clustering analysis of cells from all four geno-
types identified 4 major microglial populations (Figure 5A,
middle) and was consistent with a similar analysis performed
after removal of Apoe from the original gene count matrix
(data not shown).
We confirmed that the overall microglial responses in APP/
PS1 mice were similar to those seen in AppNL-G-F mice. The
major cluster displayed high expression of homeostatic genes

wild-type mice, measurements were made by se-
lecting random regions of interest (ROIs) in the
same brain areas as in AppNL-G-F. Measurements
were made from at least 25 plaques or ROIs for

AppNL-G-F astro, and C57BL/6J astro), collected
from 3 mice per genotype.

 (Figure 5B) (H1/2M [homeostatic microglia 1 and 2]; Figure 5A). A
second cluster displayed a high score for the ARMs signature
(ARMs cluster; Figure 5A, right), while a third cluster displayed
high scores for the interferon response signature (IRMs cluster;
Figure 5A, left). A fourth cluster displayed high levels of homeo-
static genes but also a higher ARMs score compared to that of
cluster H1/2M, thus representing a transiting state between
H1/2M and ARMs (TRMs cluster; Figure 5A). Notably, the
ARMs cluster was strongly enriched for APP/PS1 microglia
(15% of all APP/PS1 microglia; p = 0.08e�10) but contained
only
very
few
(2%)
APP/PS1-Apoenull
cells
(Figure
5D).
Conversely, APP/PS1-Apoenull mice showed 6% cells in the
IRMs cluster versus 3% of microglia in APP/PS1 mice (Fig-
ure 5C). Thus, deletion of Apoe impairs the normal deployment
of the ARMs response but does not block the IRMs response.
Moreover, lack of Apoe boosted the interferon-type response
independently of Ab deposition, as C57BL/6J-Apoenull showed
a tendency for a higher percentage of IRMs compared to
C57BL/6J mice (2.9% versus 1.2%, respectively) (Figure 5C).
This is in agreement with gene expression data from AppNL-G-F
mice, which displayed high levels of Apoe in ARMs cells, while

T. Spires-Jones, B.T. Hyman, unpublished data). In both
AppNL-G-F and APP/PS1 mice, plaques are stained heavily for
ApoE, and microglia appear to develop ramifications and to
invade plaques (Figures 6A and 6B). Lack of Apoe expression
did not alter the global amyloid burden (Figures 6B, 6D, and
6E); however, it caused a significant decrease in the amounts
of Metoxy-XO4-stained amyloid (Figure 6F), as previously re-
ported for other Apoenull AD mouse models (Holtzman et al.,
2000; Irizarry et al., 2000; Krasemann et al., 2017; Ulrich et al.,
2018), with a consequent shift of the total versus dense core
amyloid ratio (Figure 6G). Moreover, lack of ApoE causes a sig-
nificant decreased density of microglial cells around amyloid
deposits (p < 0.001; Figure 6H). Thus, ApoE, next to be involved
in amyloid aggregation, also appears required to mount a full
ARMs transcriptional response against Ab plaques.
DISCUSSION
Our data show previously unrecognized heterogeneity in both
homeostatic and reactive microglia. We identified two popula-
tions of homeostatic microglia (H1Ms and H2Ms), which display
Cell Reports 27, 1293–1306, April 23, 2019
1301
 subtle but significant gene expression differences and are
differentially enriched in different brain areas and in female
compared to male mice. The separation in these two clusters
is relevant, as H2Ms cells also decline more rapidly than
H1Ms cells with aging. We identified also two major populations
of reactive microglia. One displays a multifunctional gene
response that we call here the ARMs response. Although the
ARMs response overlaps with the DAMs response described
by Keren-Shaul et al. (2017), we provide evidence that these
cells are part of the normal evolution of microglia in healthy ag-
ing, and we find the term ‘‘disease associated’’ misleading. In
fact, ARMs cells are already detected in the brains of wild-
type mice at young ages, further underlining that they are not
necessarily disease associated. The presence of amyloid pla-
ques in AppNL-G-F mice boosts the redistribution of homeostatic
microglia to ARMs cells, which eventually become the predom-
inant population. At odds with the original DAMs response
description is also the heterogeneity in the ARMs group uncov-
ered here: several subpopulations can be discerned by the
expression of specific subsets of genes, such as genes
involved in MHC class II presentation (H2-Ab1, H2-Aa, and
Cd74) and genes potentially involved in tissue repair (Spp1,
Gpnmb, and Dkk2). These subsets are highly enriched for
AppNL-G-F microglia, suggesting that they could represent an
exaggerated or modified response to the plaques and that
these sub-responses might provide the real pathological signa-
ture of microglia in AD.
The second population of reactive microglia is enriched
for interferon response genes and therefore called the IRMs
response. IRMs are again present in wild-type and AppNL-G-F
mice in all age groups and, therefore, again part of the normal
physiological heterogeneity of microglia in the healthy mouse
brain. The IRMs population is much less affected by the pres-
ence of amyloid plaques than the ARMs population. Interest-
ingly, gene enrichment analysis indicates that ARMs, but not
IRMs, are enriched for known AD risk genes such as Apoe,
Trem2, Tyrobp (DAP12), Ctsb, Ctsd, H2-Eb1, and Pld3 (Cru-
chaga and Goate, 2015a, 2015b; Cruchaga et al., 2014; Faz-
zari et al., 2017; Heilmann et al., 2015; Hooli et al., 2015;
Lambert et al., 2015; van der Lee et al., 2015). This strongly
argues that the role of these genetic risk factors in AD is
in the activation and function of this specific microglia
subpopulation.
Microglia expressing interferon response genes have been
described as a late response to neurodegeneration in a CK-
p25 model (Mathys et al., 2017); however, these look quite
different from the IRMs described here. For example, IRMs do
not
co-express
MHC
genes
and,
as
stated
earlier,
are
present also in healthy, normal brain, even at a young age. It
should be noted that CK-p25 induces a rapid and severe neuro-
degeneration that might be different mechanistically from the
very slow and mild disease caused in AppNL-G-F mice by Ab
deposition. AppNL-G-F mice are regarded as models of early AD
pathology.

 Pseudotime analysis is a good way to investigate how different
microglial expression profiles relate to each other (Trapnell et al.,
2014). This analysis suggests that the different cell states we
describe here are, in fact, part of a continuous spectrum, with
homeostatic microglia (H1Ms and H2Ms) adapting two major
response branches, IRMs and ARMs, which increase during ag-
ing and especially upon exposure to Ab. These branching trajec-
tories broadly match the old classification of microglia as resting
(M0), pro-inflammatory (M1), and pro-resolution (M2) microglia,
but they also indicate that microglial phenotypes are highly dy-
namic (Butovsky and Weiner, 2018; Friedman et al., 2018;
Keren-Shaul et al., 2017; Mrdjen et al., 2018; Ransohoff, 2016).
Heterogeneity of microglia between different brain areas (Gra-
bert et al., 2016) and between different sexes (Villa et al., 2018) is
increasingly recognized. We show here, however, that the
response to Ab deposition evolves stereotypically across brain
areas (cortex and hippocampus) in animals of both sexes.
Remarkably, we show that microglia in female mice progress
faster over the ARMs trajectory compared to microglia in male
mice (Figure 2D). This is in agreement with previous histological
analysis (Masuda et al., 2016). Such sex-dependent differences
in microglial responses are interesting to note, as there is a
higher incidence of AD in women (Ferretti et al., 2018; van der
Flier and Scheltens, 2005; Laws et al., 2018; Mazure and
Swendsen, 2016).
We demonstrate here, in agreement with previous findings
(Keren-Shaul et al., 2017; Krasemann et al., 2017), that ARMs
induce Apoe expression up to 27-fold, compared to homeostatic
microglia. In particular, in proximity to plaques, microglia ex-
press higher levels of Apoe than astrocytes (�2.3-fold higher
median Apoe intensity per cell; Figure 3G). We show also that
Apoe is not merely a marker for this cell state but is a key compo-
nent of the ARMs response, as its deletion severely reduces the
number of microglia displaying an ARMs signature (Figure 4) and
affects the interaction of microglia with Ab plaques (Figure 5).
Given this spectacular influence of Apoe expression on the
phenotype of microglia, we speculate that a large part of the ge-
netic risk associated with the APOE4 genotype (Corder et al.,
1993; Rebeck et al., 1993) is likely executed via modification of
the microglial function rather than other mechanisms. While we
cannot exclude that the abnormal plaques that are generated
in the absence of ApoE affect the microglia response, it seems
more likely that ApoE directly modulates the response of the mi-
croglia to the plaques and that ApoE is responsible for the induc-
tion of the ARMs response to amyloid, likely by interacting with
Trem2 (Yeh et al., 2016). Thus, the major genetic risk factor for
AD, together with most other identified risk genes in GWASs,
modulates the neuroinflammatory response of the microglia to
amyloid plaques.
Our observation that many AD GWAS-associated genes
appear to change their expression in the ARMs indicates an
overlap between the pathogenesis of AD in humans and the mi-
croglial response to the accumulation of amyloid in the brain of
the mouse models. Thus, these GWAS variants, when present
in a patient, likely affect the way that microglia cope with the
accumulation of amyloid over age. In that capacity, they might
either exacerbate or act protectively with regard to the onset of
the disease. Such a view predicts that patients with a high load
of amyloid but with a protective combined polygenic risk score
(which, in the case of AD, covers mostly genes expressed in mi-
croglia) will respond in a beneficial way to amyloid and will not
develop full-blown AD.
In conclusion, our data refine the concepts of homeostatic and
reactive microglia and indicate that major AD risk factors (age,
sex, and APOE) link to a multifunctional and complex microglial
response to amyloid plaques that evolves over different
branches of a continuous spectrum of molecular phenotypes.
The complex response of the microglia, even when described
as a unique cell state, ‘‘ARMs,’’ is probably not so surprising,
as the responses of individual microglia will likely profoundly
depend on factors in the microenvironment of the plaques
requiring differential functions of the microglial toolkit to be
engaged. A particular challenge for the future is to dissect the
distribution of different ARMs subpopulations over the brain
and to add functional significance to the different gene expres-
sion patterns. It is likely that such functional dissection will lead
to a whole set of novel drug targets that each will be useful in
modulating a microglial response that is most beneficial for AD.

EXPERIMENTAL MODELS DETAILS
Mice
For the 3, 6 and 12 m.o. time points we used homozygous AppNL-G-F (Saito et al., 2014) mice, backcrossed for at least 2 generations
with C57BL/6J mice in the De Strooper lab, and wild-type C57BL/6J mice themselves. For the 21 m.o. time point, both AppNL-G-F and
C57BL/6J mice were transferred from the Saido lab to the De Strooper lab, and housed at least 1 month before being used for
experiments. Both male and female AppNL-G-F and C57BL/6J mice were used for experiments. The novel APP/PS1-Apoenull strain
is described in another manuscript [Hudry et al., submitted]. Briefly, APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) were crossed with a C57BL/
6J-Apoenull breeder to obtain homozygous APP/PS1-Apoenull mice. APP/PS1-Apoenull mice, along with parental APP/PS1 mice
and the respective control strains C57BL/6J and C57BL/6J-Apoenull, were transferred from the Hyman lab to the De Strooper lab,
and housed for at least 1 month before being used for experiments. Only male APP/PS1, APP/PS1-Apoenull, C57BL/6J and
C57BL/6J-Apoenull were used. In every case, mice were housed according to the appropriate institution’s ethical requirements,
and in compliance to the country’s laws for animal research.
METHOD DETAILS
Single cell suspension preparation
Mice were euthanized with CO2 and then rapidly perfused with ice cold PBS for 10-15 minutes using a pumping rate of 100 mL/h. The
dissection (Srinivasan et al., 2016) and microglia isolation steps were carried out on ice or at +4�C, to minimize microglia activation
due to technical artifacts. We removed the brain and placed it on a chilled glass plate sitting on wet ice. We quickly dissected the
whole cortex and the whole hippocampus separately, using instruments chilled on ice. The tissue was finely chopped using a chilled
razorblade and then transferred to a tube containing ice-cold Hibernate A medium without phenol red (BrainBits, Springfield, IL). For
each experimental condition we pooled tissue from two mice. We prepared a single cell suspension from the minced tissue using the
Adult Brain Dissociation kit from Miltenyi Biotec (Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) adapting manufacturer’s recommendations for
manual tissue processing. First, we pelleted the tissue chunks by centrifugation (300 g for 2 minutes at 4�C), removed the Hibernate
A medium and resuspended the tissue in a mix of buffer Z with enzymes P, A and Y prepared according to the manufacturer’s in-
structions. We next placed the tubes horizontally on ice for 30 minutes, with mechanical dissociation steps performed at 10 minutes
intervals (first with 5 mL pipettes, then with fire-polished glass Pasteur pipettes, and lastly with P1000 tips). The resulting cell sus-

glucose, and pyruvate (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were centrifuged, resuspended in D-PBS, gently mixed with Debris

 4�C), cells were washed once with D-PBS, resuspended in 1X Red Blood Cell Removal Solution, incubated for 10 minutes at 4�C,
diluted 10 times with D-PBS containing 0.5% BSA (Miltenyi Biotec), and pelleted by centrifugation. Cells were finally resuspended
in D-PBS containing 0.5% BSA.
Single microglia isolation by FACS
The single cell suspension was stained by incubation for 20 minutes on ice with anti-CD11b-PE conjugated primary antibody (Miltenyi
Biotec) at a 1:10 dilution. Just before loading on the sorter, cells were stained with DAPI (1:5000 final dilution). Cell sorting was
performed with a BD FACSAria III (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Gating was calibrated by running non-stained and single
stained (anti-CD11b-PE only and DAPI-only) samples. Single live microglia cells (CD11b+/DAPI-) were sorted into independent wells
of a 96-well plate, preloaded with 4 mL of 0.2% Triton in Ultrapure water (GIBCO), containing 1 U/mL of RNasinPlus RNase inhibitor
(Promega, Madison, WI). After sorting, plates were sealed, briefly centrifuged, snap frozen on dry ice, and stored at �80�C until
further processing.
Single cell mRNA libraries preparation and sequencing
Single cell retrotranscription and preparation of sequencing libraries was performed using a modified SmartSeq2 protocol (Picelli
et al., 2013, 2014; Trombetta et al., 2014) to improve the yield of cDNA from single microglia cells. We used 50-biotinylated primers
throughout the protocol, oligo-dT and IS-PCR oligos were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Skokie, IL), while template-
switching oligo (TSO) was from Exiqon (Vedbaek, Denmark). First, 96-well plates with single sorted cells were thawed on ice, and we
added to each well 1 mL of 10 mM dNTPs, 0.5 mL of 5 mM oligo-dT, and 0.5 mL of a 1:2660000 dilution of ERCC RNA Spike-In mix
(ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA). After incubating the plate at 72�C for 3 minutes, we added to each well a retrotranscription mix (con-
taining 1.5X First Strand buffer, 6.1 mM DTT, 1.7 M betaine, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.6 U/mL SUPERase IN, 11.1 U/mL SuperScript II poly-
merase, and 1.3 mM TSO oligo). All retrotranscription mix components were from the SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase kit
(ThermoFisher), except betaine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), SUPERase IN (ThermoFisher), and the TSO oligo. Retrotranscription reaction
was carried out for 90 minutes at 42�C, followed by 10 cycles of 2 minutes at 50�C and 2 minutes at 42�C, and completed by a
15 minutes incubation at 70�C. Next, we added to each well a preamplification mix containing 1X Kapa HiFi HS readymix (Kapa Bio-
systems, Wilmington, MA) and 0.2 mM of IS-PCR primer. Preamplification was carried out for 23 cycles (98�C for 20 s, 67�C for 15 s,
72�C for 6 minutes). PCR products were purified using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) at 1:0.6 ratio and according to
manufacturer’s recommendations and eluted in 12 mL of EB buffer (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). cDNA preparation was checked by
analyzing several random wells for each plate on an Agilent BioAnalyser DNA High Sensitivity chip (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). We used
the Nextera XT kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) to tagment 1.25 mL of 1:15 diluted cDNA per reaction. Tagmentation reactions were
assembled at room temperature (RT) using 2.5 mL of TD buffer and 1.25 mL of ATM mix per sample, incubated at 55�C for 8 minutes,
and then immediately placed on hold at 10�C. We next added 1.25 mL of NT buffer (Illumina) and further incubated for 5 minutes at RT.
To amplify tagmentation products, we added 1.25 mL of appropriate indexed forward and reverse primers (Nextera XT Index kit v2,
sets A, B, C, or D, all from Illumina), and 3.75 mL of NPM mix (Illumina). Amplification reaction was carried out for 12 cycles (95�C for
10 s, 55�C for 30 s, 72�C for 30 s). Amplified products from each 96 well plate were pooled and purified using AMPure XP beads at
1:0.7 ratio. Purified pools were checked on an Agilent BioAnalyser DNA High Sensitivity chip, and quantified by quantitative PCR us-
ing the Kapa Library Quantification kit for Illumina libraries. Four 96-well plate pools with compatible indexes were further pooled to
yield 384-samples libraries. Each library was sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq550 system using single end 75 base pair sequencing
kits (Illumina).
Sequencing data analysis
Demultiplexed FASTQ files were aligned to the mouse genome (mm10 build) using STAR version 2.5.2 (Dobin et al., 2013) with default
options. Reads aligned to each gene were counted using featureCounts version 1.5.1 (Liao et al., 2014) with options -g gene_name -Q
10. The count table was imported in R (version 3.4.4) for analysis. Data generated from AppNL-G-F and C57BL/6J mice, and data
generated from APP/PS1, APP/PS1-Apoenull, C57BL/6J and C57BL/6J-Apoenull mice are referred here as two separate datasets.
Quality control of cells - step 1
For each dataset, to exclude poorly sequenced cells, damaged cells and dying cells, we filtered out cells outside the limits of
median ± 4 * median absolute deviations for both reads number and genes detected; moreover, we excluded cells with more
than 10% of reads aligning to mitochondrial genes (Figure S2A and Figure S6A). Data was analyzed by principal component analysis
(PCA) to identify obvious batch effects, in which case we would discard the entire 96-well plate (we excluded two plates following this
procedure). For the first dataset, the median depth of sequencing was 572,294 reads/cell, with an interquantile range of 253,445
reads/cell, while the median number of genes detected per cell was 2,250 (interquantile range: 572). After quality control (Figure S2A)
we retained 11,038 cells for further analysis, with at least 270 cells for each experimental condition (Table S1).
Quality control of cells - step 2
For each dataset, we applied a workflow based on the R package Seurat (version 2.3.1 (Butler et al., 2018)) to identify and remove
non-microglia cells before proceeding with analysis. For the first dataset, after data normalization and scaling, we performed
principal component analysis (PCA) on the 4,687 most variable genes detected. Based on a scree plot (i.e., a plot of the PC eigen-
values in decreasing order) of standard deviations of the principal components (PCs), we selected the first 17 PCs as input for the

 calculations to identify cell clusters (Seurat FindClusters function). We then performed non-linear dimensionality reduction and we
visualized cell clusters on a t-SNE plot (Figure S3A). We identified 10 major cellular populations, most of them showing a tight dis-
tribution on the t-SNE plot, with only two clusters (7 and 9) clearly separating (Figure S2B). Based on a panel of marker genes (Fig-
ure S2C), we had no enrichment for markers of brain cells other than microglia, but two clusters (7 and 9, figure S2B-C) showed high
expression levels of genes markers of perivascular macrophages (Mrc1) and neutrophils (Ccr2 and Pldb1). Indeed, clusters 7 and
9 scored low for a microglial genes signature (Figure S2D) and high for a neutrophil genes signature (Figure S2E). We did not find
cells expressing gene signatures of other brain cells (Figure S2C: neurons (Gria2), astrocytes (Aqp4), oligodendrocytes (Olig1)),
confirming that 97.9% of cells (10,801/11,038) in our post-QC dataset were microglia. Only the 10,801 microglia cells were retained
for further analysis. For the second dataset, we considered the top 4,711 most variable genes, and we used the first 12 PCs for initial
clustering. We identified several clusters, with one displaying high score for a neutrophil marker genes signature (cluster 12, Fig-
ure S6E), which was removed prior to subsequent analysis. The other cells scored high for a microglia marker genes signatures
(Figure S6D), while expression of markers of other brain cell types were low or null (Figure S6C).
Clustering
Cells passing QC were analyzed using functions provided with the Seurat package. Data was log normalized and we regressed out
the variables of read count and percentage of reads aligning on mitochondrial genes. Next, we identified the genes with highest vari-
ability and performed PCA on such gene set. We identified the most informative principal components based on a scree plot and we
used these to perform cell clustering. Identification of differential expressed genes was performed using the Wilcox test implemented
by Seurat’s FindMarker. t-SNE plots were prepared using Seurat’s t-SNE implementation. For the first dataset, we considered 4,777
highly variable genes for PCA and the first 14 PCs for clustering. The second dataset was analyzed similarly as described above, by
performing PCA on the 4,967 most variable genes and by using the first 10 PCs to perform cluster analysis.
Pseudotime analysis
To infer the pseudotime of microglia progression toward response development we used functions provided with the Monocle 2
package (version 2.6.4 (Qiu et al., 2017a, 2017b; Trapnell et al., 2014)). We performed a semi-supervised identification of cell trajec-
tories and states, based on marker genes identified during clustering. Briefly, we defined a series of genes (Apoe, Ifit3, H2-Aa, Dkk2),
which are selectively expressed in each response type (main response and interferon-based) and in the subpopulations identified,
which we used to build a classifier (CellTypeHierarchy) to assign cell identities in terms of microglia states of activation. We then
calculated a covariance matrix for these marker genes, and we used the top 1000 genes (ranked by p value adjusted) to calculate
single cell trajectories.
Differential Expression
Differential expression was performed using functions provided with the Seurat package; p values were calculated using the
Wilcoxon rank-sum test, with all Seurat parameters set to default. Genes with adjusted p values (using a Bonferroni correction) <
0.05, and ln fold changes > j0.2j were considered significantly differentially expressed.
Z scores of microglia responses signatures
For Figure 3, signatures were calculated using Seurat’s AddModuleScore function using a list of relevant genes identified from GSEA
as input. For Figure 5, Z scores were calculated by considering the top genes showing differential expression between ARM and
homeostatic cells in the AppNL-G-F dataset (n genes = 18) or between the IRM and homeostatic cells in the AppNL-G-F dataset
(n genes = 28), respectively. Top genes were defined as being statistically significant after multiple testing correction and displaying
at least 1 ln fold change. Apoe was excluded from the gene signature to avoid skewing the calculations in Apoenull samples.
Human RNaseq data analysis
We analyzed RNaseq data obtained from the AMP-AD (Accelerating Medicines Partnership – Alzheimer’s disease) portal (Hodes and
Buckholtz, 2016) for the ROSMAP (Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project) (Mostafavi et al., 2018) and MSBB (Mount
Sinai Brain Bank) cohorts (Wang et al., 2018). The identifiers for these studies on the AMP-AD portal (www.synapse.org) are
syn3157743 for MSBB and syn3388564 for ROSMAP. The reads were trimmed, aligned and mapped to the reference genome
and the transcript expression levels quantified by their automated pipelines. The ROSMAP study provides RNaseq data from the
Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex and the MSBB study has samples from the Prefrontal Cortex (PFC), Inferior Frontal Gyrus (IFG), Su-
perior Temporal Gyrus (STG) and Parahippocampal Gyrus (PHG). Genes were considered to be microglial of their expression was at
least two times the average expression in other cell types, according to cell type specific data provided by the ‘‘brain RNA seq’’ web
portal (https://web.stanford.edu/group/barres_lab/brain_rnaseq.html). Sequencing data was analyzed as described in Bihlmeyer
et al. (2019), and differential expression analysis was conducted using CERAD staging (Mirra et al., 1991) between C3 and C0
subjects.
Multiplex RNAscope and immunofluorescence staining
Mice were euthanized with CO2 and then rapidly perfused with ice cold PBS (10 minutes at 100 mL/h). Brain was removed and sepa-
rated into two hemispheres. One hemisphere was then embedded in molds containing Tissue-Tek OCT (VWR, Radnor, PA), snap
frozen in a bath of ethanol and dry ice, and stored at �80�C to perform RNAscope experiments, while the other hemisphere was pro-
cessed for immunostaining as described below.

Cell Reports 27, 1293–1306.e1–e6, April 23, 2019
 OCT-embedded hemispheres were cut into 14 mm sagittal sections using a CryoStar NX70 cryostat (ThermoFisher), layered on
SuperFrost Plus glass slides (ThermoFisher) and further stored at �80�C before proceeding with experiments.
RNAscope experiments were performed using the Manual Fluorescent Multiplex kit v1 (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Newark, CA)
following manufacturer’s recommendations with minor adjustments. After fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 30 minutes,
sections were dehydrated using a series of ethanol dilution steps; protease digestion was performed for 20 min at RT using
Protease IV for fresh frozen tissue provided in the kit, and probes hybridization was carried out for 2 hours at 40�C. We used the
following probe sets (all from Advanced Cell Diagnostics): Mm-Slc1a3 (430781), Mm-Itgam-C2 (311491-C2), Mm-Apoe-C3
(313271-C3). Immediately after the RNAscope amplification steps, the sections were rinsed briefly with PBS and blocked for
1 hour at RT in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 5% normal goat serum. Sections were then immunostained with the anti-b-am-
yloid 1-16 6E10 primary antibody (BioLegend, San Diego, CA) at 4�C overnight, washed 3 times for 5 minutes in PBS, and further
stained for 1 hour at RT with an Atto-488-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO). Sec-
tions were then incubated for 30 s in a 1X TrueBlack (Biotium, Fremont, CA) solution to reduce lipofuscin autofluorescence, washed
briefly and stained with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich). Sections were mounted with FluorSave Reagent (Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA). Im-
aging was carried out on a Leica TCS SP8 X confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) using a 40X objective,
images were analyzed using Fiji ImageJ (Rueden et al., 2017; Schindelin et al., 2012).
RNAscope image analysis and quantification
Three 21-25 months old mice for each C57BL/6J and AppNL-G-F strain were used for the quantifications. For each mouse, four images
of the hippocampus (two of CA1, one of CA2 and one of CA3) and five images throughout the isocortex were acquired and stacked in
Fiji ImageJ. NIS-elements software (Nikon, Amsterdam, Netherlands) was used to detect nuclei, microglia, astrocytes and plaques
using a custom-made protocol. Nuclei and cell body perimeter were established using the DAPI signal; microglia and astrocytes were
identified by RNAscope puncta from the Itgam and Slc3a1 probes. All parameters were kept constant between images to allow un-
biased detection. Plaque staining was judged individually in each image, as plaques vary greatly in size and intensity of staining. Arbi-
trary plaques were drawn in the images of C57BL/6J mice. Images from C57BL/6J and AppNL-G-F mice were analyzed in the same
manner, for the latter mice we considered only the dense plaques. Around each plaque, five concentric circles of 18.2 mm were
drawn, for each circle we counted microglia and astrocytes cells, and for each cell we measured the intensity of the signal from
the Apoe probeset.
Immunofluorescence staining
Mice were sacrificed with CO2 and perfused with ice cold PBS (10 minutes at 100 mL/h), and the brain divided into two hemispheres
as described above. One of the hemispheres was fixed in 4% PFA overnight and then stored in PBS containing 0.01% sodium azide
at +4�C until sectioning on a vibratome. For sectioning, the hemispheres were embedded in UltraPure agarose (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) and cut into 35 mm sections on a Vibratome Leica VT1000S. Antigen retrieval was performed using boiling citrate buffer (Sigma-
Aldrich) at pH 6.0. The sections were then blocked in PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100 and 5% normal donkey serum for 1h at RT and
incubated in primary antibody at 4�C overnight. The following day sections were washed with PBS and incubated with secondary
antibodies for 1 hour at RT. Nuclei were stained with DAPI and sections were mounted with Fluorosave (Merck Millipore). The
following primary antibodies were used: mouse anti-b-amyloid 1-16 6E10 (BioLegend), rabbit anti-Iba1 (Wako-Chemicals, Neuss,
Germany), goat anti-ApoE (Sigma-Aldrich). Secondary antibodies were: donkey anti-mouse Alexa 488 (Invitrogen A21202), donkey
anti-rabbit Alexa 594 (Invitrogen A211207), donkey anti-goat Alexa 647 (Invitrogen A21447).
Amyloid load analysis
Tissue collection and processing
Mice were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation and the brain tissue collected for immunohistochemical analysis. After fixation in 4%
paraformaldehyde and cryoprotection in 30% glycerol, 40 mm-thick floating sections were cut on a freezing microtome. Floating sec-
tions were permeabilized in 0.5% triton in TBS, blocked in 5% normal goat serum in TBS, and incubated with primary antibody
(mouse anti-amyloid b Bam10, Sigma-Aldrich; rabbit anti-Iba-1, Wako) overnight at 4�C. Sections were then incubated with appro-
priate Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 568 conjugated secondary antibodies. Sections were mounted onto slides and coverslipped
with Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). For the counterstaining of dense-core amyloid plaques,
the floating sections were incubated for 15 minutes in a solution of 1 mg/ml of Methoxy-XO4 (diluted in TBS) before mounting the
slices with Fluoromount-G (No DAPI, SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL).
Stereology-based quantitative analyses
For the quantification of amyloid load, Alexa-568-anti-Amyloid immunolabeled and Methoxy-XO4 positive plaques were imaged us-
ing a NanoZoomer-XR Digital slide scanner (Hamamatsu Photonics, Shizuoka, Japan) under a 20X objective. The total surface of
amyloid was determined using a custom-written script based on the ‘‘Analyze particle’’ function of Fiji (National Institutes of Health:
http://fiji.sc/), after defining the cortex as region of interest. The total surface occupied by amyloid was then reported to the cortical
area of each section considered. Stereology-based study of amyloid-associated microglia was performed on immunolabeled
sections using an Olympus BX52 epifluorescent microscope equipped with motorized stage, DP70 digital CCD camera, and
CAST stereology software (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The cortex was outlined and microglia counts were made using 20X high

 numerical aperture (1.2) objective. Using a meander sampling of 70% of cortical area, images were captured each time an amyloid
deposit was encountered. Those images were then analyzed using Fiji, counting the number of Iba1-positive microglial cells close to
a plaque (< 50 mm) and reporting this number to the surface of the plaque considered. All pathology quantification was carried out
blinded until the last statistical analyses.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical details of experiments can be found in the respective figure legends and method sections. We provide here a brief
summary.
Differential gene expression
Differential expression was performed using functions provided with the Seurat R package. To calculate p values, we used the Wil-
coxon rank-sum test with default parameters, and we used a Bonferroni correction to calculate adjusted p values for multiple testing.
Genes with adjusted p values < 0.05, and with a fold change (ln scale) > j0.2j were considered significantly differentially expressed.
RNAscope signal quantification and cell count
Around each plaque, or an arbitrary point in C57BL/6J mice, we drew five concentric circles of 18.2 mm. We counted microglia
(Itgam+) and astrocytes (Slc1a3+) in each ring, and for each cell we measured the intensity of the signal from the Apoe probeset using
the Fiji software.
Stereological quantification of amyloid burden and microglia density
Sections were imaged with a 20X objective and an epifluorescent microscope, and data were analyzed using a custom script based
on the ‘‘Analyze particle’’ function of Fiji software. 5 to 7 mice per group werer analyzed, p values were calculated using the Mann-
Whitney test.
