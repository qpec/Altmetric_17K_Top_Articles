Abstract
Recently, it was suggested that neurons can release and transfer damaged mitochondria to 
astrocytes for disposal and recycling 1. This ability to exchange mitochondria may represent a 
potential mode of cell-cell signaling in the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we show that 
astrocytes can also release functional mitochondria that enter into neurons. Astrocytic release of 
extracellular mitochondria particles was mediated by a calcium-dependent mechanism involving 
CD38/cyclic ADP ribose signaling. Transient focal cerebral ischemia in mice induced astrocytic 
mitochondria entry to adjacent neurons that amplified cell survival signals. Suppression of CD38 
signaling with siRNA reduced extracellular mitochondria transfer and worsened neurological 
outcomes. These findings suggest a new mitochondrial mechanism of neuroglial crosstalk that 
may contribute to endogenous neuroprotective and neurorecovery mechanisms after stroke.
Astrocytes play broad roles in the CNS, and are involved in the regulation of 
neurodevelopment, neurotransmission, cerebral metabolism and blood flow 2–4. Normal 
astrocytes protect neurons against oxidative stress and excitotoxicity 5–7. In contrast, 
unhealthy astrocytes may release deleterious factors that damage neurons 8,9. Healthy 
mitochondria may be essential for these neuroglial protective mechanisms because inhibition 
of astrocytic mitochondria makes neurons vulnerable to cell death 10. Mitochondria 
comprise the intracellular cores for energetics and viability 11, but under some conditions 
mitochondria might also be released into extracellular space 12. For instance, retinal neurons 
may transfer mitochondria to astrocytes for disposal and recycling 1, and bone-marrow

 derived stromal cells may transfer mitochondria into pulmonary alveoli to suppress acute 
lung injury 13.
In this study, we asked whether astrocytes can produce functional extracellular mitochondria 
to support neuronal viability after ischemic stroke. Electron microscopy confirmed the 
presence of extracellular particles containing mitochondria in conditioned media from rat 
cortical astrocytes (Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 1a). qNano analysis revealed that astrocyte-
derived mitochondria particles following FACS isolation spanned a range of sizes from 300 
to 1100 nm (Extended Data Fig. 1b–d), and included populations that were positive for β1-
integrin (79%) and CD63 (43%) (Extended Data Fig. 2). Mitotracker-labeling suggested that 
these extracellular mitochondria may still be functional (Fig. 1b), and filtration of astrocyte 
conditioned media through 0.2 μm filters depleted the amounts of functional mitochondria 
and reduced measurements of mitochondrial ATP, membrane potential and oxygen 
consumption (Fig. 1b–e).
An important question at this point is whether extracellular mitochondria represent active 
signals or merely cellular debris. To address this question, we asked whether stimulated 
astrocytes could actively produce extracellular mitochondria. CD38 catalyzes the synthesis 
of a calcium messenger, cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) in mitochondrial membranes 14,15. In 
brain, CD38 is mainly expressed in glial cells, and may have a role in neuroglial crosstalk 
since astrocytes increase CD38 expression in response to glutamate release from neurons 16. 
Based on this background literature and the fact that most actively secreted cellular events 
involve calcium regulation, we decided to assess CD38-cADPR-calcium signaling as a 
candidate mechanism for the astrocytic production of extracellular mitochondria. First, we 
confirmed that rat cortical astrocytes expressed CD38 protein and CD38/cADPR cyclase 
activity (Fig. 1f, g). Then, we tried two methods to modify this pathway. When astrocytic 
CD38 was upregulated using CRISPR/Cas9 activation plasmids, functional endpoints of 
extracellular mitochondria were significantly increased in conditioned media (Fig. 1h–k). 
When astrocytes were stimulated by cADPR to activate CD38 signaling, extracellular 
mitochondria were increased in conditioned media along with enhancement of functional 
endpoints in a calcium-dependent manner (Fig. 1l–n, Extended Data Fig. 3). Stimulation 
with cADPR did not appear to damage astrocyte viability (Fig. 1o), suggesting that this 
release of extracellular mitochondria was not due to nonspecific cytotoxicity.
If astrocytes can produce functional extracellular mitochondria, then is it possible that these 
signals may affect adjacent neurons? When rat cortical neurons were subjected to oxygen-
glucose deprivation, intracellular ATP levels fell and neuronal viability decreased, as 
expected (Fig. 2a–c, Extended Data Fig. 4). When astrocyte-conditioned media containing 
extracellular mitochondrial particles was added to neurons, ATP levels were increased and 
neuronal viability was recovered (Fig. 2a–c, Extended Data Fig. 4). But when extracellular 
mitochondria were removed from the astrocyte-conditioned media, neuroprotection was no 
longer observed (Fig. 2a–c, Extended Data Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained with 
immunostaining-based cell counts (Fig. 2d). As a control, ATP-liposomes were not 
significantly protective (Fig. 2e), suggesting that the astrocytic mitochondria entry into 
neurons may generate additional benefits beyond ATP energetics per se. Fluorescent

 microscopy confirmed that astrocyte-derived mitochondria appeared to be present within 
treated neurons (Fig. 2f).
Beyond the prevention of acute neuronal death, delayed neuroplasticity is also important for 
stroke outcomes. CD38 may be important for brain plasticity because CD38-deficient mice 
show worsened recovery after brain injury 17 and CD38 mutations may comprise risk factors 
for behavioral dysfunction 18. Hence, we asked whether CD38-mediated astrocyte-into-
neuron mitochondrial transfer may also influence neuroplasticity. Neurons were labeled with 
CellLight Mitochondria-GFP and astrocytes were separately labeled with Mitotracker Red 
CMXRos, and then the two cell types were co-cultured together for 24 hours. Confocal 
microscopy indicated that astrocyte-derived mitochondria were detected within soma and 
axon (Fig. 3a), and in these co-culture conditions, astrocytes supported neuronal survival 
after serum/glucose starvation in a CD38-dependent manner (Extended Data Fig. 5). When 
astrocytic mitochondria were made dysfunctional via inhibition of mitochondrial aconitase, 
cADPR-stimulated astrocytes no longer supported neuronal survival and axonal extension 
(Extended Data Fig. 6). To further assess our hypothesis, we asked whether this ability of 
astrocytes to transfer mitochondria could in fact enhance neuroplasticity under pathological 
conditions. Control or CD38-silenced astrocytes were co-cultured with surviving neurons 
after oxygen-glucose deprivation (Fig. 3b). siRNA suppression of CD38 in astrocytes 
reduced mitochondria transfer (Fig. 3c) and dendrite regrowth after injury (Fig. 3d).
Taken together, these cellular findings appear consistent with the overall hypothesis that 
CD38 signaling may help astrocytes transfer mitochondria into neurons and promote 
survival and plasticity after injury. But does this mechanism work in vivo? To answer this 
question, we turned to a mouse model of focal cerebral ischemia. First, primary mouse 
cortical astrocyte cultures were labeled with MitoTracker Red CMXRos and extracellular 
mitochondria particles were collected. Then mice were subjected to focal cerebral ischemia, 
and 3 days later, extracellular mitochondria particles were directly injected into peri-infarct 
cortex. After 24 hrs, immunostaining suggested that transplanted astrocytic mitochondria 
were indeed present in neurons (Fig. 3e). Next, we turned to FVB/N-Tg 
(GFAPGFP)14Mes/J transgenic mice where astrocytes are fluorescently labeled. When these 
mice were subjected to focal cerebral ischemia, fluorescent mitochondrial particle signals 
appeared within adjacent neurons at 24 hours post-stroke (Fig. 3f). Neurons that were 
collected from ischemic peri-infarct cortex via flow cytometry showed a general 
upregulation of cell survival-related signals such as phosphorylated Akt and Bcl-xl along 
with an increase of the mitochondria marker TOM4 (Fig. 3g, Extended Data Fig. 7).
Finally, we attempted loss-of-function experiments to ask whether blocking CD38 signaling 
results in worsened outcomes after stroke. In our mouse models of focal cerebral ischemia, 
CD38 was upregulated in the peri-infarct cortex (Extended Data Fig. 8a). At 5 days post-
stroke, CD38 siRNA or control siRNA were injected into cerebral ventricles (Fig. 4a). By 2 
days after siRNA injections, total CD38 expression in the peri-infarct cortex was 
successfully downregulated (Extended Data Fig. 8b). There were no clear differences in 
infarct area nor the total levels of GFAP-positive reactive astrocytes (Fig. 4b, c), but 
astrocyte subsets that expressed CD38 were significantly decreased without affecting the 
number of other CD38 expressing cells such as CD8 T cells and microglia/macrophages 19

 (Fig. 4c, Extended Data Fig. 8c–g). To assess the levels of extracellular mitochondrial 
particles in this in vivo model, flow cytometry was used to analyze cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF). GFAP-positive mitochondria were detected in CSF, and CD38 siRNA injections 
appeared to reduce this extracellular population of astrocyte-derived mitochondria (Fig. 4d). 
At the same time, flow cytometry was used to quantify levels of MAP2 neuronal 
mitochondria (Extended Data Fig. 9). Brains treated with CD38 siRNA showed a significant 
reduction in neuronal mitochondria (Fig. 4e), suggesting that interfering with CD38 
signaling may have suppressed endogenous astrocyte-to-neuron mitochondrial transfer. 
These effects were accompanied by a reduction in peri-infarct GAP43 (a surrogate marker of 
neuroplasticity, Fig. 4f, g) as well as worsened neurologic outcomes (Fig. 4h, i). 
Furthermore, CD38 suppression significantly decreased oxygen consumption measurements 
in CSF-derived extracellular mitochondrial particles (Fig. 4j), and neurologic outcomes 
seemed to be negatively correlated with these functional endpoints (Fig. 4k, l), suggesting 
that CSF mitochondrial function may be a potential biomarker of neuroglial signaling after 
stroke.
Taken together, these findings suggest that astrocytes may release extracellular 
mitochondrial particles via CD38-mediated mechanisms that enter into neurons after stroke 
(Fig. 4m). But there a few caveats and the detailed mechanisms and generalizability of these 
proof-of-concept findings should warrant further investigation. First, the dynamics of 
extracellular mitochondria release and entry into neurons as well as quantitative thresholds 
for functional benefit remain to be fully defined (Extended Data Fig. 10a–i). A second 
caveat relates to mitochondrial entry mechanisms. In neurons, endocytosis may be regulated 
by dynamin/clathrin 20 or integrin pathways 21. In our models, integrin-mediated src/syk 
signaling may be involved (Extended Data Fig. 10j–m). How integrin-mediated 
mitochondrial transfer is modulated under different disease conditions requires further study. 
Third, CD38 is also expressed in immune cells. In this study, CD38 suppression with siRNA 
in vivo did not appear to affect T cells or microglia/macrophages, but the balance between 
potentially beneficial CD38 signals in astrocytes versus deleterious CD38 signals in immune 
cells should be carefully considered. A fourth caveat is whether other glial cells may 
participate. Microglia, oligodendrocytes and pericytes are activated after stroke 22,23, so their 
potential roles in mitochondrial exchange warrants further investigation. Finally, astrocytes 
can produce many factors for protecting and restoring neurons, including tPA, high-mobility 
group box 1 (HMGB1), extracellular microvesicles containing VEGF and FGF-2, and 
various microRNAs 24–27. How mitochondrial particles may interact with these other 
extracellular signals should be explored.
Non-cell autonomous signaling is vital for CNS recovery after injury or disease 28,29. In the 
context of cerebral ischemia, the present study suggests that astrocytes may release 
extracellular mitochondrial particles that enter into neurons to support cell viability and 
recovery after stroke.

 Methods
Reagents
BAPTA-AM (A1076), cyclic ADP ribose (C7344) and dynasore hydrate (D7693) were 
purchased from Sigma, and RGDS peptide (3498) and MNS (2877/50) were purchased from 
R&D systems.
Mouse Focal Cerebral Ischemia Models
All experiments were performed following an institutionally approved protocol in 
accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines and with the United States Public 
Health Service’s Policy on Human Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Our methods also 
included randomization, blinding and statistical criteria consistent with ARRIVE guidelines 
(Animals in Research: Reporting In vivo Experiments). Basically, male C57Bl6 mice (12–14 
weeks) or FVB/N-Tg (GFAPGFP)14Mes/J mice are anesthetized with 5% to 1% isoflurane, 
and rectal temperatures and cerebral blood flow are monitored. After midline skin incision, 
7-0 nylon monofilament coated with silicon resin was introduced through a small incision 
into the common carotid artery. Adequate cerebral ischemia was assessed by Laser Doppler 
flowmetry and by examining forelimb flexion after the mice recovered from anesthesia. The 
mice were re-anesthetized, and reperfusion was established by withdrawal of the filament. 
Functional outcome after stroke was assessed by neurological severity scores and foot-fault 
test 25.
Primary neuron cultures
Primary neuron cultures were prepared from cerebral cortices of E17-day-old Sprague-
Dawley rat embryos or E17-day-old FVB/N-Tg (GFAPGFP)14Mes/J mouse embryos. 
Briefly, cortices were dissected and dissociated using papain dissociation system 
(Worthington Biochemical Corporation, LK003150). Cells were spread on plates coated 
with poly-D-lysine (Sigma, P7886) and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium 
(NBM, Life Technology, 11965-084) containing 25 mM glucose, 4 mM glutamine, 1 mM 
sodium pyruvate, and 5% fetal bovine serum at a density of 2 × 105 cells/mL (1mL for 12 
well format, 0.5 mL for 24 well format). At 24 hours after seeding, the medium was changed 
to Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen, 21103-049) supplemented with B-27 (Invitrogen, 
17504044) and 0.5 mM glutamine. Cells were cultured at 37°C in a humidified chamber of 
95% air and 5% CO2. Cultures were used for experiments from 7 to 10 days after seeding.
Primary astrocyte cultures
Primary astrocyte cultures were prepared from cerebral cortices of 2-day-old neonatal 
Sprague-Dawley rats or E17 C57Bl6 mice. Briefly, dissociated cortical cells were suspended 
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM, Life Technology, 11965-084) containing 25 
mM glucose, 4 mM glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 10% fetal bovine serum and 
plated on uncoated 25 cm2 flasks at a density of 6×105 cells/cm2. Monolayers of type 1 
astrocytes were obtained 12–14 days after plating. Non-astrocytic cells such as microglia 
and neurons were detached from the flasks by shaking and removed by changing the 
medium. Astrocytes were dissociated by trypsinization and then reseeded on uncoated T75

 flasks. After the cells reached 70–80% confluence, cultures were switched to Neurobasal 
medium containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin or DMEM containing 1% penicillin/
streptomycin, and astrocyte-conditioned media were collected 24h later. Collected astrocyte-
conditioned medium (ACM) was treated by spin cell debris down with centrifuging at 
2,000g for 10 minutes or by filtrating through a 1.2-μm syringe filter for further experiments.
Oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and reoxygenation
OGD experiments were performed using a specialized, humidified chamber (Heidolph, 
incubator 1000, Brinkmann Instruments, Westbury, NY) kept at 37 °C, which contained an 
anaerobic gas mixture (90% N2, 5% H2, and 5% CO2). To initiate OGD, culture medium 
was replaced with deoxygenated, glucose-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (Life 
Technology, 11966-025). After 2 h challenge, cultures were removed from the anaerobic 
chamber, and the OGD solution in the cultures was replaced with maintenance medium. 
Cells were then allowed to recover for 18 h (for neurotoxicity assay) and 72 h (for siRNA/
astrocyte coculture) in a regular incubator.
Cell Viability Assays
Neuronal injury was measured by standard cell cytotoxicity assays such as lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH) using the Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (Roche Applied Science, 
11644793001) and/or Cell Counting Kit 8 cytotoxicity assay (DOJINDO, CK04-13). For 
LDH assay, 100% cell death was induced with 0.5% triton X in sister culture. The relative 
assessments of neuronal injury were normalized by comparison with 100% cell death (LDH 
assay) or with control cell as 100% cell survival (CCK8).
Determination of CD38/ADPR-cyclase activity
ADPR cyclase activity was determined by fluorometrically using nicotinamide guanine 
dinucleotide (NGD+) (Sigma, N5131) as a substrate as described before 30,31. Astrocytes or 
neurons were incubated with 200 μM NGD+, and the production of cGDPR was determined 
at excitation/emission wavelengths of Ex 300 nm/Em 410 nm with a microplate reader.
ATP measurement
Intracellular or extracellular ATP was determined by CellTiter-Glo luminescence (Promega, 
G7570) which can perform cell lysis and generate a luminescent signal proportional to the 
amount of ATP present. Briefly, opaque-walled 96-well plates with culture media (50μl) or 
cell lysate (50μl) were prepared. CellTiter-Glo luminescence test solution (50μl) was added 
and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Luminescent signal was determined by 
luminescence microplate reader.
Liposomal ATP treatment
Liposomal ATP was obtained from Encapsula NanoScience. Briefly, we used lyophilized 
proliposomes compose of 7:3 molar ratio of L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine: L-±-
phosphatidylserine containing ATP which forms 100 nm liposomal ATP upon hydration. 
ATP-loaded liposome (1–1000 nM) was co-incubated with neurons following oxygen-
glucose deprivation, and cell viability was analyzed after 18 h reoxygenation.

 Mitochondria membrane potential measurement
To monitor mitochondrial health, JC-1 dye (invitrogen, T-3168) was used to assess 
mitochondrial membrane potential. Rat cortical astrocytes or media were incubated with JC1 
(5 μM or 1 μM) for 30 min at 37 °C. JC1 dye exhibits potential-dependent accumulation in 
mitochondria, indicated by fluorescence emission shift from green (Ex 485 nm/Em 516 nm) 
to red (Ex 579 nm/Em 599 nm). Mitochondria membrane potential was determined by the 
fluorescent ratio with a fluorescent microplate reader.
Oxygen consumption analysis
Real time oxygen consumption in astrocytic particles or in CSF samples were measured by 
Mito-ID Extracellular O2 sensor kit (Enzo Life Science, ENZ-51045) according to the 
instruction provided Enzo Life Science. Briefly, astrocytes (70–80% confluent cells/
well/100 μL ) or particle fraction (100μL; 25-fold concentrated astrocytic conditioned 
media) were prepared in non-coated regular 96 wells, and O2 sensor probe (10 μL) was 
added into each well. Each CSF sample (8 – 20 μL) was collected from cisterna magna at 
day 7 after focal cerebral ischemia. Following centrifugation at 2,000g for 10 minutes, 6 μL 
CSF was diluted in 54 μL PBS, and 6 μL O2 sensor probe was added into each well. After 
covering with 100 μL (50 μL for CSF sample) of Mito-ID HS Oil, the plate were read with 
filter combination of 340 nm for excitation and 642 nm of emission at 30 °C.
Electron microscopy analysis
Rat cortical astrocytes or pellets from astrocyte-conditioned media were fixed in 2.0% 
glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4 (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 
Hatfield, PA) for one hour at room temperature on a rocker. They were rinsed in cacodylate 
buffer, gently scraped and pelleted and post-fixed in 1.0% osmium tetroxide in cacodylate 
buffer for one hour on ice. They were rinsed in buffer and stabilized with a small amount of 
2% agarose in PBS to hold them together. They were then dehydrated through a graded 
series of ethanol to 100%, followed by propylene oxide, 100%. They were infiltrated with 
Epon resin (Ted Pella, Redding, CA) in a 1:1 solution of Epon:propylene oxide overnight on 
a rocker at room temperature. The following day they were placed in fresh Epon for several 
hours and then embedded in Epon overnight at 60 C. Thin sections were cut on a Leica EM 
UC7 ultramicrotome, collected on formvar-coated grids, stained with uranyl acetate and lead 
citrate and examined in a JEOL JEM 1011 transmission electron microscope at 80 kV. 
Images were collected using an AMT digital imaging system (Advanced Microscopy 
Techniques, Danvers, MA). These methods are similar to previous descriptions of 
extracellular particle and mitochondria detection in astrocyte cultures 12.
FACS analysis
Standard FACS analysis was performed by BD LSR II or BD Fortessa as described 
before 25,32,33. Astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) was collected from rat cortical 
astrocytes labeled with Mitotracker Red CMXRos followed by filtrating through a 1.2-μm 
syringe filter. The supernatant was used to sort labeled mitochondria fraction by FACSAriaII 
cell sorter configured with 561 nm air cooled laser. Brain cells were collected from peri-
infarct cortex after stroke. Briefly, tissues are gently minced and then digested at 37°C for 30

 min with an enzyme cocktail (Collagenase type I, DNase I, Sigma Aldrich). CSF samples 
were prepared for further staining after centrifugation at 2,000g for 10 minutes. FACS 
analysis was performed using an unstained or phenotype control for determining appropriate 
gates, voltages, and compensations required in multivariate flow cytometry.
Measurement of particle size
Particle size following extracellular mitochondria isolation by FACS was determined by 
qNano (iZON). Nanopore-based detection allows particle-by-particle assessment of complex 
mixtures. Optimization of pore size to particle size, by adjusting the stretch of the pore, 
allows highly accurate measurement 34. Particles containing mitochondria were sorted using 
FACS analysis, then particle sizes were quantified by NP400 and using CPC400 calibration 
particle.
Western blot analysis
Western blot was performed as previously reported 25. Each sample was loaded onto 4–20% 
Tris-glycine gels. After electorophoresis and transferring to nitrocellulose membranes, the 
membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 0.2% I-
block (Tropix, T2015) for 90 min at room temperature. Membranes were then incubated 
overnight at 4°C with following primary antibodies, anti-β-actin (1:1,000, Sigma-aldrich 
A5441), anti-GFAP antibody (1:1,000, BD biosciences, 556328), anti-MAP2 antibody 
(1:500, Abcam, ab11267 or ab32454), anti-CD38 antibody (1:500, Santacruz, sc-7049), anti-
TOM40 (1:200, Santacruz, sc-11414), anti-phosphorylated Akt (1:500, Cell signaling, 
9271), anti-Bcl-xl (1:500, Cell signaling, 2764), anti-active caspase 3 (1:200, Abcam, 
ab32042), anti-AIF (1:500, Abcam, ab32516), anti-GAP43 (1:500, Santacruz, sc-17790). 
After incubation with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, visualization was 
enhanced by chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare, NA931- anti-mouse, or NA934- anti-
rabbit, or NA935- anti-rat). Optical density was assessed using the NIH Image analysis 
software.
Immunocytochemistry and immunohistochemistry
Immunocytochemistry and immunohistochemistry performed as described before 35,36. 
After staining with primary antibody, fluorescent-tagged secondary antibody, nuclei were 
counterstained with or without 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and coverslips were 
placed. Immunostaining images or time lapse images were obtained with a fluorescence 
microscope (Nikon ECLIPSE Ti-S) interfaced with a digital charge-coupled device camera 
and an image analysis system or confocal microscope analysis using Carl Zeiss Laser 
Scanning Confocal Microscope Pascal 5 LSM and Pascal 5 LSM software Version 3.2. 
Dendrite elongation was assessed following MAP2 staining followed by NeuriteQuant 
analysis 37.
CRISPR activation plasmid transfection
Control CRISPR activation plasmid (sc-437275), rat CD38 CRISPR activation plasmid 
(sc-437321-ACT) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Transfection was 
performed according to the transfection protocol for cell cultures from Santa Cruz

 Biotechnology. Briefly, Plasmid transfection reagent mixture of 1ml (Transfection reagent, 
sc-395739, Transfection medium, sc-108062) was co-incubated with astrocytes for 24 hours 
in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C, and then CD38 cyclase activity was assessed in order to 
confirm efficiency of transfection.
siRNA experiment
Control siRNA, CD38 siRNA were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Control 
siRNA (sc-37007) consists of a scrambled sequence that will not lead to the specific 
degradation of any known cellular mRNA. Mouse CD38 siRNA (sc-37246) or Rat CD38 
siRNA (sc-270394) is each pool of 3 target-specific 19–25 nt siRNAs designed to knock 
down gene expression. The sequences for mouse CD38 siRNAs are designed as followed; 
5′-GUGUACUACCAACAUUCAA-3′, 5′-GUGUGUCUUUAGUAGGUAU-3′, 5′-
CCAGUUUGUGAUUGUUGA-3′. Rat CD38 siRNAs are designed as followed; Sequence 
1: 5′-CUCAAACCAUACCAUGUAA-3′, Sequence 2: 5′-
GGAAGAGCUUCCCAAUACA-3′, Sequence 3: 5′-GUGUUAUCGUCUAGCAAUA-3′.
siRNA were prepared according to the transfection protocol for cell cultures from Santa 
Cruz Biotechnology. Briefly, siRNA transfection reagent mixture of 1ml (Transfection 
reagent, sc-29528, Transfection medium, sc-36868) was co-incubated with astrocytes for 6 
hours in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C, and then same amount of DMEM 20% FBS was 
added. An additional incubation was performed for 18 hours.
Statistical analysis
Results were expressed as mean±SEM. When only two groups were compared, unpaired t-
test was used. Multiple comparisons were evaluated by one-way ANOVA followed by 
Tukey’s Kramer or two-way ANOVA. P<0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

extracellular astrocyte-derived particles. Free mitochondria were also found in astrocyte-
conditioned medium. b, In FACS analysis, control beads were used to gate population 
ranging in size from 500 nm to 900 nm. c, In astrocyte-derived conditioned media,

FACS analysis identified that approximately 79% and 43% of particles express β1-integrin 
and CD63, respectively (n=4). cADPR (1 μM) did not appear to affect these distributions 
(n=4). All values are mean +/− SEM.

 Extended Data Figure 3. Production of astrocytic mitochondria particle in a Ca2+-dependent 
mechanism
a, The known CD38 downstream signal, cADPR increased intracellular calcium shown in 
Fluo-4 intensity in a concentration-dependent manner (n=3). b, Intracellular ATP in 
astrocytes was upregulated by cADPR stimulation (n=4). **P<0.01 vs cADPR 0 μM. c, To 
measure ATP levels in extracellular particles, astrocyte-conditioned media were collected 
and large debris were excluded by centrifugation and filtration using 1.2 μm filter. Following 
another centrifugation at 20,000g for 30 min, each 100 μl from top or bottom fractions were 
used for ATP assay. d, The bottom fraction had higher ATP content, and cADPR (1 μM) 
increased ATP content in this bottom fraction (n= 6 or 8). e, cADPR-induced extracellular 
ATP levels within extracellular particles was diminished by intracellular calcium blocker, 
BAPTA-AM (n= 4 or 6). All values are mean +/− SEM.

 Extended Data Figure 4. Summary of experiment on Figure 2c
a, We repeated the experiment in Fig. 2c with n=4 independent primary cultures per group. 
Similar results were obtained. The extracellular mitochondria-depleted astrocyte media 
(mdACM) group was significantly different compared to the ACM group. Furthermore, in 
this repeated experiment, there was also statistical significance between controls (OGD-
damaged neurons alone) versus those treated with mitochondria-containing astrocyte media 
(ACM), and there was no statistically significant worsening when comparing control versus 
mitochondria-depleted groups (mdACM). Taken together, these two separate experiments 
suggest a modest but statistically significant neuroprotection induced by astrocyte-derived 
mitochondria. All values are mean +/− SEM. b, Mitotracker Red CMXRos (200 nM) was 
incubated without astrocytes to obtain no-cell-derived media (negative control). Media was 
collected and further incubated with neurons following oxygen-glucose deprivation. After 24 
hours, there was no mitochondrial signal observed. Scale: 100 μm.

 Extended Data Figure 5. Role of astrocytic CD38 in mitochondria transfer during starvation in 
vitro
a, Immunocytochemistry in neuron-astrocyte co-cultures demonstrated that CD38 was 
primarily expressed within astrocytes. b, Extracellular ATP levels were higher in media 
collected from neurons co-cultured with astrocytes compared to neuron-alone cultures alone 
(n=9 or 11). c, After serum/glucose starvation, neurons were significantly damaged, as 
expected. But neurons co-cultured with astrocytes were protected (n=6 or 4). d, CD38 
suppression with siRNA significantly decreased extracellular ATP levels in neuron-astrocyte 
co-culture, but CD38 suppression did not affect extracellular ATP level in neuron-alone 
cultures (n=9 or 6). e, Blockade of astrocytic CD38 with siRNA significantly increased LDH 
release (indicative of cell damage) in the co-culture, suggesting that CD38 may be important 
to maintain neuroglial homeostasis (n=6). f, Rat primary neurons were co-cultured with rat 
astrocytes. Immunocytochemistry showed that CD38 suppression with siRNA reduced 
astrocytic mitochondria (red) transfer into neurons compared to control. g, h, Western blot 
analysis indicated that CD38 suppression with siRNA can be successfully performed in 
astrocyte culture without affecting cell viability (n=4 or 3). All values are mean +/− SEM.

 Extended Data Figure 6. Metabolic inhibition in astrocyte causes neuronal cell death and retards 
neurite outgrowth in vitro
a, Astrocytic aconitase was inhibited by fluorocitrate (FC) which disrupted astrocyte 
metabolism that was accompanied by SA-β-gal signal. b, Intracellular ATP was decreased in 
these metabolically-disrupted astrocytes (n=6). *P<0.05, **P<0.01 vs FC 0 mM. c, PI 
staining showed that fluorocitrate (0.5 mM) did not induce cell death in astrocytes. d, 
Metabolically-disrupted astrocytes significantly decreased mitochondrial membrane 
potential. Red: aggregated JC1, Green: monomer JC1. Scale: 20 μm. e, Rat cortical neurons 
were co-cultured with JC1-labeled astrocytes. After 24 hours co-culture, control astrocytes 
transferred mitochondria which had a high-membrane potential (aggregated JC1), but 
metabolically-disrupted astrocytes released and transferred dysfunctional mitochondria into 
neurons (n=3). f, Metabolically-disrupted astrocytes could not support neural viability under 
starvation in the co-culture (n=4). g, Co-culture between astrocytes and neurons was 
conducted for 48 hours to test neurite outgrowth. Immunocytochemistry showed that 
metabolically-disrupted astrocytes retarded neurite outgrowth and increased neuronal cell 
death (n=3). h, LDH assay indicated that fluorocitrate (0.5 mM) did not affect cell viability 
in either rat cortical astrocytes (n=4) or rat cortical neurons (n=4). All values are mean +/− 
SEM.

 Extended Data Figure 7. FACS analysis using E17 FVB/N-Tg (GFAPGFP)14Mes/J transgenic 
mice
a, Cortical neurons were isolated from E17 FVB/N-Tg (GFAPGFP)14Mes/J transgenic 
mice. Immunocytochemistry showed that cultured neurons did not express either GFP or 
GFAP protein following oxygen-glucose deprivation, suggesting that stroke-like stress may 
not likely lead to “leakiness” in this astrocyte-specific GFP mouse. b, Brain cell suspension 
was prepared from FVB/N-Tg (GFAPGFP)14Mes/J mice subjected to transient ischemia, 
then FACS analysis was performed. c, Representative image before cell sorting. d, Purity 
after cell sorting. e, Either MAP2+/GFP- or MAP2+/GFP+ population was positive for 
DAPI as 92.5% or 85.9%, respectively. f, Western blot analysis demonstrated that both GFP-
positive and negative neurons expressed mature neuron marker (neurofilament) but not 
neuronal stem cell marker (nestin). These data exclude the possibility that GFAP-positive 
cells included subsets of neuronal precursor cells that are known to also express GFAP.

 Extended Data Figure 8. Effects of CD38 suppression with siRNA in vivo and in vitro
a, Western blot showed that CD38 expression was increased in peri-infarct cortex at days 1 
to 7 after stroke. b, CD38 siRNA or a scrambled control was injected into lateral ventricles 
at 5 days after stroke. Western blot analysis confirmed that CD38 expression was 
successfully decreased in peri-infarct cortex at 7 days. c, In peri-infarct cortex, CD8 T cell 
and Iba1 positive microglia/macrophage were detected by immunohistochemistry. d, 
Quantification of the number of CD8 positive cells or Iba1 positive cells indicated that there 
was no difference between control siRNA and CD38 siRNA (n=6). All values are mean +/− 
SEM. e, Cultured rat cortical astrocytes were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation for 2 
hours followed by treating with control siRNA or CD38 siRNA. Astrocyte cell morphology 
or GFAP expression was assessed by immunocytochemistry or western blot after 22-h 
reoxygenation. f, Morphology change was not clearly observed in cultured astrocytes 
suppressed CD38 with siRNA compared to control siRNA. g, Western blot analysis showed 
that CD38 was successfully decreased by siRNA transfection but GFAP expression was not 
clearly changed.

 Extended Data Figure 9. Neuronal purity confirmed by FACS analysis in vivo
To be sure about our FACS findings, we used two different standard approaches that have 
been published in the literature (Bi et al, J Neurosci 2011; Cruz et al, Nat Neurosci Rev 
2013) a, By FACS, MAP2 positive population were gated and further assessed by other 
markers such as Iba1 (microglia/macrophage) and GFAP (astrocyte) in brain cell samples 
isolated from C57Bl6 mice. These comparisons confirmed that the MAP2+ population did 
not contain any appreciable amounts of microglia or astrocyte, whereas another neuron 
marker (NeuN) was highly enriched. b, Similar findings were obtained using an alternative 
gating method to isolate neurons.

 Extended Data Figure 10. Involvement of integrin-mediate src/syk mechanisms in astrocytic 
mitochondrial entry into neurons in vitro
a and b, Cultured rat cortical astrocytes were stimulated by cADPR (1 μM) for 24 hours. 
Intracellular mitochondria labeled by mitotracker dye was significantly increased in 
astrocytes stimulated with cADPR (1 μM) (n=7). **P<0.01 vs 0h. c, Some of mitochondria 
were found outside of cells. d, FACS analysis revealed that approximately 5×105 
mitochondria were contained in 1mL of astrocyte-derived conditioned media (n=6). cADPR 
(1 μM) significantly increased the number of mitochondria in the media (n=6). e, 
Experimental schedule to quantify the mitochondrial entry into neurons following oxygen-
glucose deprivation. Rat cortical neurons (1×105 cells/well) were prepared in 24-well culture 
plate. ACM or cADPR-ACM (each 1 mL) was co-incubated with neurons for 18 hours. 
Mitochondrial entry into neurons were calculated by mitochondrial intensity measured 
before and after washing cells with PBS. Phenol red free culture media were used to

 decrease back ground signal. Back ground signal was subtracted from fluorescent intensity 
obtained from each sample. f, Oxygen-glucose deprivation for 2 hours decreased 
approximately 50% of mitochondria in neurons after 18 h reoxygenation (n=4). g, All data 
are expressed as relative values, with total neuronal mitochondria after 2 h OGD/18 h 
reoxygenation being 100%. Mitochondrial entry into neurons was slightly higher in cADPR-
ACM treatment (18%) compared to ACM treatment (11%), although there was no 
statistically significance (n=4). h, There was no difference in the percentage of 
mitochondrial entry between ACM treatment and cADPR-ACM treatment (n=4). i, cADPR-
ACM treatment supported neuronal viability better than ACM treatment (n=4). j, Co-culture 
between rat cortical astrocytes in the upper chamber and rat cortical neurons in the lower 
chamber was performed for 18 hours following oxygen-glucose deprivation for 2 hours in 
neurons. Then, mitochondrial entry into neurons was measured. k, Immediately after 
oxygen-glucose deprivation, dynasore (5 μM), RGDS peptide (50 μg/ml), or MNS (1 μM) 
was initially added in neurons for 30 min, then astrocyte co-culture was performed for 18 
hours. The data are expressed as relative values, with astrocytic extracellular mitochondria 
plus entered mitochondria into neurons being 100%. RGDS peptide and MNS significantly 
decreased mitochondrial entry into neurons, but dynasore did not inhibit the entry. l, MNS 
treatment significantly decreased astrocyte-mediated neuroprotection (n=4). m, Dynasore (5 
μM), RGDS peptide (50 μg/ml), or MNS (1 μM) did not affect neuronal viability after 2 h 
oxygen-glucose deprivation (n=4). All values are mean +/− SEM. These data suggest that 
astrocyte into neuron mitochondrial particle entry may involve integrin-mediate src/syk 
mechanisms. However, we acknowledge that these pathways may be multifactorial and 
deeper analyses are warranted to dissect entry mechanisms under various physiologic and 
pathologic conditions.

 Fig. 3. Astrocytic mitochondria and neuroplasticity after ischemic stress
a, Confocal microscopy revealed that astrocytic mitochondria (red, Mitotracker Red
