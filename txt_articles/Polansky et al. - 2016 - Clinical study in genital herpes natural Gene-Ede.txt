Background: This paper reports the results of a clinical study that tested the effect of suppres-
sive treatment with the botanical product Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin on the number of genital 
herpes outbreaks. The results in this study were compared to those published in clinical studies 
of acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir.
Methods: The framework was a retrospective chart review. The population included 139 
participants. The treatment was one to four capsules of Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin per day. The 
duration of treatment was 2–48 months. The study included three controls recommended by the 
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA): baseline, no treatment, and dose response.
Results: The treatment decreased the number of outbreaks per year in 90.8% of the participants. 
The treatment also decreased the mean number of outbreaks per year from 7.27 and 5.5 in the 
control groups to 2.39 (P,0.0001 and P,0.001, respectively). The treated participants reported 
no adverse experiences. Out of the 15 tests that compared Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin to the three 
drugs, Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin had superior efficacy in eight tests, inferior efficacy in three 
tests, and comparable efficacy in four tests. Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin also had superior safety.
Conclusion: The clinical study showed that the natural Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin decreases 
the number of genital herpes outbreaks without any side effects. The study also showed that 
the clinical effects reported in this study are mostly better than those reported in the reviewed 
studies of acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir.

Introduction
Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted viral infection caused by the herpes simplex 
virus (HSV) type 2 and HSV type 1 (HSV-1).1 Genital herpes is often characterized by 
recurrent outbreaks. The median recurrence rate after the first episode of genital herpes 
is about four outbreaks per year, with ~40% of patients having at least six outbreaks 
and 20% having more than ten outbreaks per year.2,3
Three drugs are currently used in the treatment of recurrent genital herpes: acyclovir 
(ACV), valacyclovir (VACV, a prodrug of ACV), and famciclovir (FCV, a prodrug of 
penciclovir).1,4 ACV was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
in 1984, VACV in 1995, and FCV in 1994. These drugs use modified nucleosides, 
or their prodrugs.5 The drugs inhibit the activity of the viral DNA polymerase, which 
is the main replication enzyme of the virus. All drugs are used in both suppressive 
and episodic therapies. Episodic therapy uses self-administration of the drug during 
outbreaks, and the main objective is decreasing the duration of the outbreaks.6 Clinical 
studies have shown that episodic treatment with these drugs shortens the time to lesion

healing by 1–2 days.7–9 Suppressive therapy involves daily 
administration of the drug before the onset of an outbreak. 
The most common objective of suppressive therapy is 
decreasing the number of outbreaks.10 Clinical studies have 
demonstrated that suppressive treatment with these drugs for 
a period of 4–12 months decreases the number of outbreaks 
such that about half of patients remain recurrence-free and 
the other half show a 70%–80% decrease in the frequency 
of their outbreaks.11,12
Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin is a patented botanical product 
that consists of five natural ingredients: quercetin 100 mg, 
green tea extract 150 mg, cinnamon extract 50 mg, selenium 
100 µg, and licorice extract 25 mg. Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin 
was developed to target latent viruses, and diminish their 
deleterious effect on the host, as explained by the Microcom-
petition theory.13–15 Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin was introduced 
in the marketplace at the end of 2009. A post-marketing 
clinical study conducted at the Center for the Biology of 
Chronic Disease showed that Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin is 
antiviral.16 Another post-marketing clinical study showed 
that Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin safely decreased the feeling of 
fatigue in individuals infected with a latent virus.17
This paper reports the results of a post-marketing clinical 
study that tested the effect of suppressive treatment with 
Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin on the frequency of genital herpes 
outbreaks, or the number of outbreaks per period. The paper 
also compares the clinical effects of Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin 
to those of ACV, VACV, and FCV.
Materials and methods
Objective
The objective of this clinical study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identi-
fier: NCT02715752) was to test the effect of Gene-Eden-VIR/
Novirin on the frequency of genital herpes outbreaks.
Framework
The framework was a retrospective chart review. The 
company that sells Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin provides a 
service to the customers who purchase the products. The 
service consists of tracking the changes in the customers’ 
health while using the products. The company is using a 
questionnaire called the Natural Origin Treatment Clinical 
Questionnaire (NotCiq). The data are collected over the 
phone by professional interviewers in a single session. The 
NotCiq is a patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument. 
The charts produced in these sessions were analyzed in this 
study. More details on the NotCiq questionnaire are available 
in our previous study.16
randomization
Randomly selected charts, collected during a 2-month period, 
October and November 2015, were analyzed. The two months 
were randomly selected.
Treatment
Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin is a patented botanical product 
that consists of five natural ingredients: quercetin 100 mg, 
green tea extract 150 mg, cinnamon extract 50 mg, selenium 
100 µg, and licorice extract 25 mg. The treatment was one to 
four capsules of Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin per day.
The duration of treatment ranged from 2 to 48 months. 
The mean duration of treatment was 12 months.
The treatment group included 119 participants. The 
study included three FDA-recommended controls: baseline 
control, consisting of 119 participants; no-treatment control, 
consisting of 20 participants; and dose-response concur-
rent control, consisting of 119 participants. The baseline 
control included participants “before” treatment or pretreat-
ment. The no-treatment control included participants who 
had just purchased Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin, and had not 
yet started taking the treatment.
Outcome measures
The NotCiq for genital herpes has several sections: a sec-
tion on gender, age, and ethnicity of the participants; a 
section on the duration of treatment, dosage, and adverse 
experiences; a section on diagnosis and type of symptoms; 
a section on the frequency of symptoms; and a section on 
blood pressure and body weight. The questionnaire uses 
both open- and closed-ended questions. The answers to the 
closed-ended questions are on a scale of 1–7. The answers 
to the NotCiq were collected in phone interviews by four 
independent interviewers, who were specialized in outbound 
call services. The interviewers were blinded to the objective 
of the study.
Efficacy
The primary end point was the number of outbreaks per 
period. Secondary end points included the time to first 
recurrence, the percentage of recurrence-free patients, the 
percentage of prevented or delayed recurrences, and the 
number of participants who had over a 50% reduction in 
their recurrence rate.
safety
The participants’ reports of adverse events were collected 
and analyzed.

natural formula for genital herpes: frequency results
Population
Participants who were using Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin for 
other purposes, such as treatment for cancer, chronic diseases, 
and hypertension, were excluded.
Participants who were concurrently taking antiviral medi-
cations, including ACV, VACV, and FCV, as suppressive 
treatment were also excluded. The final list of participants 
consisted of 139 men and women aged $18 years with at 
least one genital herpes outbreak per year.
ethical consideration
The study was approved by the Salus Institutional Review 
Board. The approval included a complete waive to obtain 
patient’s informed consent, due to the nature of the study.
statistical analysis
The analysis was based on the intent-to-treat (all participants 
randomized) population. We analyzed the time to first recur-
rence of a genital herpes outbreak using the Kaplan–Meier 
product limit method, and the differences between the curves 
were evaluated by log-rank, Wilcoxon, and Tarone–Ware tests. 
We also calculated the delta, that is, the difference in scores 
between pretreatment and during treatment. Then, we tested 
the statistical difference between the deltas. Statistical analysis 
was performed using a two-tail t-test assuming unequal vari-
ances. P#0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
Results
Patient demographics and baseline 
characteristics
A total of 139 participants were included in the study. Table 1 
summarizes the demographics and clinical characteristics of 
these participants (Table 1).
Efficacy
Primary efficacy end points
Out of the 119 participants in the treatment group, 108 
(90.8%) reported a decrease in the number of recurrences per 
year. The mean number of recurrences per year decreased 
from 7.27 and 5.5 in the pretreatment and no-treatment con-
trols, respectively, to 2.39 in the treatment group (67% and 
57%, P,0.0001 and P,0.001, respectively) (Table 2).
We also tested the effect of different dosages (Table 3). 
Because participants with a greater number of outbreaks 
had a tendency to take a higher dosage of Gene-Eden-VIR/
Novirin, we selected participants with a similar number of 
recurrences per year. Specifically, we selected those with two 
to four recurrences. The data included 42 such participants, 
18 who took one capsule and 24 who took two capsules per 
day. The mean number of outbreaks per year before treat-
ment was similar in both dosage groups (3.11 and 3.08, 
respectively; P=0.45). We then analyzed the number of 
outbreaks per year following treatment in both groups. The 
mean number of recurrences per year decreased to 0.9 and 
0.5 in the group that took one and two capsules, respectively 
(P=0.08). These results had borderline significance for the 
existence of a dose effect. We also tested for the existence of a 
dose effect from another direction. We analyzed the deltas for 
the two dosage groups by performing a Student’s t-test on all

119 participants. The mean decrease in number of recurrences 
per year (the delta) was 4.2 and 5.9 for one and two capsules, 
respectively (P=0.088). This test resulted in a similar statisti-
cal significance for the existence of a dose effect.
We then tested the effect of different durations of treat-
ment (Table 4). A common inclusion criterion of the clinical 
studies that tested drugs against genital herpes is at least six 
genital herpes outbreaks per year. To test for a duration-of-
treatment effect, we also used this criterion. The data included 
54 such participants. After examining these participants, we 
removed three outliers from the analysis. These participants 
had constant outbreaks with no remission. We observed that 
these participants responded excessively fast to the treatment, 
and therefore, distorted the duration-of-treatment analysis. 
The results showed a statistically significant difference 
in the delta values between those participants who took 
Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin for 2–6 months and those who 
took the treatment for .6 months (3.8 vs 8.5, respectively; 
P,0.01). These results showed the existence of a duration-
of-treatment effect.
We also analyzed the effect of age on the decrease in 
the number of recurrences per year. The results showed a 
negative trend. That is, older people had a smaller decrease 
in the number of recurrences per year. However, this trend 
was not statistically significant.
To test the internal consistency of the participants, the 
following two questions were included: “How often did 
the symptoms appear before (after) taking Gene-Eden-
VIR/Novirin?”, which were scored on a scale from 1 to 7, 
where 1 was “very often” and 7 was “not at all”. The mean 
scores were 3.2 and 5.7 for the questions regarding “before” 
and “after” taking Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin, respectively 
(P,0.0001) (Table 2). The results showed that both the 
measures of frequency, the number of recurrences per year 
and the scale between “very often” and “not at all”, gener-
ated consistent results.
We also tested for the effect of diagnosis on the results 
(Table 5). The data included two types of diagnoses: diag-
nosis by a physician and self-diagnosis. The mean number 
of recurrences per year was 7.32 and 2.40 during the pre-
treatment and treatment period, respectively (P,0.0001), 
in participants diagnosed by a physician, and 7.04 and 2.39, 
respectively (P,0.001), in self-diagnosed participants. There 
was no statistically significant difference between the two 
groups for the two periods (P=0.4 in the pretreatment group 
and P=0.5 in the treatment group).
Secondary efficacy end points
The time to first recurrence was calculated using the Kaplan–
Meier product limit method. The mean survival time, that 
is, the number of days to first recurrence, was 103.91 and 
105.01 during the pretreatment and no-treatment periods, 
respectively, and 537.34 days during the treatment period 
(P,0.0001 for treatment vs each control). These results

showed that Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin prolonged the time to 
first recurrence. Figure 1 clearly shows that treatment with 
Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin increased the time to first recurrence 
in those with at least one recurrence per year (Figure 1A), 
at least six recurrences per year (Figure 1B), and at least 
eight recurrences per year (Figure 1C). Figure 1 also shows 
that treatment with Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin decreased the 
frequency of genital herpes outbreaks (Figure 1D).
In both the pretreatment and no-treatment controls, zero 
participants were recurrence-free (Table 2). After 1 year 
of treatment, 42% were recurrence-free (P,0.0001). Also, 
Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin prevented or delayed 90.8% of the 
recurrences, and 87 of 119 (73.1%) participants had over a 
50% reduction in the recurrence rate.
safety
There were no reports of adverse events from taking Gene-
Eden-VIR/Novirin. In addition, there were no statistically 
significant changes in body weight. Also, out of the 119 
participants, 23 reported suffering from high blood pressure 
before treatment. Out of these 23 participants, 15 reported no 
change in their blood pressure, and eight, an improvement, 
that is, a decrease in their blood pressure. A statistical analysis 
showed that Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin significantly lowered 
the participants’ blood pressure (P,0.01).
gene-eden-Vir/novirin vs leading drugs
The following section compares the clinical effects of 
Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin with those reported in published 
clinical studies that tested the three leading drugs approved 
by the FDA for the treatment of genital herpes, specifically 
ACV, VACV, and FCV.
In order to find the published clinical studies that tested 
ACV, VACV, and FCV as a chronic suppressive treatment 
for genital herpes, we conducted a systematic search of the 
literature for original research articles indexed in PubMed 
(MEDLINE) database. We searched for randomized con-
trolled trials that tested ACV, VACV, or FCV as a treatment 
for genital herpes. In the computer searches, we used the fol-
lowing title/abstract words: “genital”, “herpes”, “acyclovir”, 
“valacyclovir”, “valaciclovir”, and “famciclovir”. We did not 
use date restrictions. We included all articles that evaluated 
the frequency of genital herpes outbreaks before and after oral 
antiviral therapy in immunocompetent individuals, where the 
population included both adult men and nonpregnant women. 
We found five clinical studies.10,12,18–20
Efficacy
The comparative analysis of Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin effi-
cacy utilized three sets of studies. The first set consisted of 
three studies: Douglas et al,18 Reitano et al,12 and Mertz et al19 
(Table 6). The participants in these studies had at least six 
recurrences of genital herpes per year. The second set con-
sisted of one study: Patel et al20 (Table 7). The participants in 
this study had at least eight recurrences of genital herpes per 
year. The third set also consisted of one study: Corey et al10 
(Table 8). The participants in this study had less than ten 
recurrences of genital herpes per year.
To summarize, out of 15 tests, Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin 
had superior efficacy in eight tests, inferior efficacy in three 
tests, and comparable efficacy in four tests (Table 9). This 
indicates that Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin has comparable-to-
superior efficacy compared to ACV, VACV, and FCV in 
decreasing the frequency of genital herpes outbreaks.
safety
Douglas et al18 observed adverse events in some of their 
patients, including diarrhea, headache, weight loss, nausea 
or vomiting, abdominal pain, insomnia, fever, vertigo, and 
anorexia. Reitano et al12 observed mild adverse events, the 
most frequent of which were headache, rhinitis, infection, and 
flu-like syndrome. Sixty serious adverse experiences were 
reported by 48 patients during the Reitano et al study, the most 
common being depression. Mertz et al19 observed that the 
 
most common adverse experiences in FCV-treated subjects 
were headache, nausea, and diarrhea. Patel et al20 observed 
that most adverse experiences were of mild intensity, and 
the most common were headache and nausea. Finally, 
Corey et al10 observed that the frequency of adverse effects 
was similar to those reported in the study by Patel et al.

Polansky et al
The most frequent adverse effects reported in the product 
insert for suppressive therapy were the following: nausea, 
diarrhea, and headache for ACV; headache, nausea, and 
abdominal pain for VACV; and headache, nausea, and diz-
ziness for FCV.
In addition, the literature reports non-common adverse 
events for these three drugs. For instance, Yavuz et al 
reported that a 78-year-old female with normal baseline 
renal function, and no contributing possible nephrotoxic 
factors, developed irreversible renal dysfunction after 
oral ACV treatment.21 Becker et al reported that a patient 
developed rapidly progressive acute renal failure with 
concomitant mental status changes following treatment 
with high-dose parenteral ACV.22 Another uncommon 
but serious side effect of ACV treatment is neurotoxicity 
that may lead to confusion, hallucinations, seizures, and 
obtundation.23
Le Cleach et al conducted a meta-analysis of 26 clinical 
studies that tested the effectiveness and safety of the three 
oral antiviral drugs, ACV, FCV, and VACV.24 They found 
that withdrawals due to harms were reported in only eight or 
31% of the studies. In these studies, 31 withdrawals due to 
harms were reported in the antiviral groups, in comparison 
to 14 in the placebo or no-treatment groups. In addition, 
only four or 16% of the studies reported safety data in the 
form of the total number of adverse events. Overall, these 
four studies reported 331 adverse events in 561 participants 
(59%) in the antiviral groups, including three serious adverse 
events (one hypertension crisis, one intestinal obstruction, 
and one angor), compared to 115 adverse events in 291 
participants in the placebo or no-treatment groups (40%), 
including three serious adverse events (two renal signs and 
one fatal pneumonia).
Lam et al analyzed a cohort of 76,269 patients who 
received ACV or VACV, and 84,646 who received FCV.25 
The results showed that 0.27% of the patients were hospital-
ized with acute kidney injury following treatment with ACV 
or VACV, and 0.28% following treatment with FCV.
In our study, there were no reports of adverse events 
following treatment with Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin. Fur-
thermore, there were no statistically significant changes in 
body weight.

natural formula for genital herpes: frequency results
Discussion
Our study showed that suppressive treatment with Gene-Eden-
VIR/Novirin decreased the frequency of genital herpes out-
breaks. The results also showed the existence of a dose effect 
and a duration-of-treatment effect. Specifically, the results 
showed that treatment with two capsules per day decreased 
the frequency of genital herpes outbreaks more than treatment 
with one capsule per day, and that treatment for .6 months 
decreased the frequency of outbreaks more than treatment for 
2–6 months. Finally, the results showed that suppressive treat-
ment with Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin has no side effects; that is, 
suppressive treatment with Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin is safe.
The study showed that the clinical effects of Gene-Eden-
VIR/Novirin observed in this clinical study are mostly better 
than those reported in the reviewed clinical studies that tested 
ACV, VACV, and FCV (Table 9).

Notes: in all the studies, the subjects had less than ten genital herpes outbreaks per year. aadjusted from 8 months to a full year for the corey et al study. The P-values 
are taken from the original study. bsince the distribution of the number of recurrences per patient is not mentioned in corey et al, it seems that their sample includes many 
participants with eight or nine recurrences per year, while our participants include many more participants in the 3–5 range. as a result, their mean monthly recurrence 
in the placebo group is higher than our mean monthly recurrence in the pretreatment group. This initial condition prevents gene-eden-Vir/novirin from showing its full 
efficacy in this specific sample.
Abbreviations: geV/nV, gene-eden-Vir/novirin; VacV, Valacyclovir.
The argument for large sample sizes, randomization, inde-
pendent verification by different laboratories, etc, is to even out 
specific peculiarities, or confounding factors, inherent to any 
specific setting. The same result under dissimilar settings is 
considered reliable. We compared Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin to 
ACV, VACV, and FCV using results reported in five studies. 
These studies treated diverse populations under different con-
ditions. The comparison showed that Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin 
has comparable-to-superior efficacy. Since the conditions in 
these studies were different, we believe that the conclusion is, 
most likely, robust. In other words, the observed comparable-
to-superior efficacy is not an artifact of any specific condition; 
that is, it has strong external validity.
Our study did not attempt to measure the effect of 
Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin on the herpes virus itself but the 
symptoms it causes. Y
et, a better understanding of the Gene-
Eden-VIR/Novirin mechanism of action is important. Such 
an understanding can be gleaned from some of the following 
in vitro studies that tested the effects of the Gene-Eden-VIR/
Novirin ingredients.
In one study, Laconi et al reported that glycyrrhizin, 
an active component of licorice, increased the production 
of Beclin 1 twofold more than rapamycin, a reference 
compound.26 Beclin 1 is an autophagy activator that was 
shown to inhibit the replication of HSV-1.27 Laconi et al also 
showed that when glycyrrhizin was added to HeLa cells con-
currently with HSV-1, glycyrrhizin had a strong anti-HSV-1 
effect, whereas rapamycin did not. Other studies showed 
that licorice root decreased the adhesion of HSV-1 to host 
cells, and inhibited HSV-1 proliferation.28–30 Another study 
reported that epigallocatechin gallate, an active compound 
of green tea, interacted with tryptophan residues in HSV-1 
surface proteins, and inhibited the attachment of the virus to 
its target cell by competing with heparin for HSV-1 binding.31 
The same study also suggested that epigallocatechin gallate 
suppressed the HSV-1 replication by interrupting the late 
stages of the viral gene expression. Another study showed 
that quercetin activated two fuel-sensing molecules, AMP-
dependent kinase and Sirtuin, which are involved in survival 
pathways and neuroprotection.32 This activation increased 
the viability of HSV-1-infected neurons, and reduced the 
viral titer and expression of viral genes. The same study 
also showed that quercetin decreased the levels of caspase-3 
cleaved and hyperphosphorylated tau, which are associated 
with HSV-1 infection. Another study showed that organic 
selenium decreased the activity of myeloperoxidase, and 
increased the TNF-α and IFN-γ cytokines that play a 
beneficial role in the clearance of the HSV.33 The study also 
reported that selenium attenuated the increase of reactive 
species, including malondialdehyde, and the inhibition of 
superoxide dismutase caused by the virus.

Notes: in the comparison, we used the average clinical effects of all four gene-
eden-Vir/novirin dosages. Therefore, we also used the average clinical effects of all 
drug dosages in each of the five clinical studies. When the difference between our 
results and their results was ,10%, we considered the results as equal.

natural formula for genital herpes: frequency results
These in vitro studies show that the Gene-Eden-VIR/
Novirin ingredients have many effects on the HSV-1-infected 
cells. The additive effect of these mechanisms might explain 
how Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin achieves its clinical objectives 
with the surprisingly low dosages of its five ingredients. 
Moreover, the many mechanisms highlight an important 
aspect of the Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin therapy. While ACV, 
VACV, and FCV are single-target treatments, Gene-Eden-
VIR/Novirin is multi-target. In other words, while all three 
drugs inhibit the activity of a single molecule, the viral 
DNA polymerase, Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin operates on 
many targets.
Our study has some methodological advantages. The 
cited clinical studies have a single duration of treatment. 
Specifically, Corey et al10 assessed patients after 8 months 
of treatment. Douglas et al,18 Patel et al,20 and Mertz et al19 
assessed patients after only 4 months of treatment, and 
Reitano et al12 assessed patients after 12 months of treatment. 
In contrast, our study tested the effect of the treatment over 
a wide range of durations, from 2 to 48 months, with an 
average of 12 months. Moreover, 28% of the participants in 
our study took Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin for at least 2 years, 
and some, for as long as 4 years, a much longer duration of 
treatment that was tested in the cited clinical studies. The use 
of a range of durations, rather than a single duration, made it 
possible to test for a duration-of-treatment effect.
Another methodological advantage is using two types 
of questions to gather information about the frequency of 
outbreaks. The first type asked the participants to count 
the number of outbreaks, and the second asked them to 
rate the frequency of their outbreaks on a 1–7 scale. Using 
these two types, we verified the consistency in the partici-
pants’ answers.
This post-marketing study did not include a placebo 
control. Placebo-controlled studies are regarded as the gold 
standard in medical research in premarketing clinical studies. 
However, except in rare cases, post-marketing studies do 
not use placebo controls. They use other controls recom-
mended by the FDA. The FDA guidance lists six types of 
controls for both premarketing and post-marketing studies: 
1) placebo concurrent control, 2) no-treatment concurrent 
control, 3) dose-response concurrent control, 4) active 
(positive) concurrent control, 5) external control (including 
historical control and baseline-controlled studies), and 
6) multiple control groups.34 The Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin 
post-marketing clinical study included three controls recom-
mended by the FDA: a no-treatment concurrent control, a 
dose-response concurrent control, and a baseline control, a 
type of external control.
This study used PROs. These types of observations 
are used extensively in clinical trials for collecting clinical 
data.35 In fact, out of the 96,736 clinical trials registered in 
the ClinicalTrials.gov database between November 2007 
and December 2013, 26,337, or 27%, used at least one PRO 
measure.36 In addition, past studies showed that PROs had 
a significant role in the development and evaluation of new 
medicines.37 According to the FDA, PROs are a valid and 
valuable source for measuring the efficacy of new drugs. They 
are reliable enough to warrant an approval of a label claim for 
a new drug. From the years 1997 to 2002, the FDA approved 
23 new drugs based on results obtained in studies that used 
only PRO end points. They include six antimigraine prod-
ucts (Amerge®, Ax-ert®), several antiepileptics (Gabitril®, 
Keppra®), and a variety of other therapy classes (Tamiflu®, 
Relenza®). The FDA regards PROs as a valid and valuable 
source of data. The scientific community also believes that 
PROs are valid and useful. Many major journals published 
clinical studies that use PROs. The trust of the FDA and the 
scientific community in PROs should convince the medical 
community, and specifically, doctors, to trust studies that use 
PROs when evaluating the benefits of new treatments.
A possible limitation of using PROs in our study is the 
subjective report of symptoms. To address this issue, we 
compared the symptoms reported by the participants to 
the standard signs and symptoms. The comparison clearly 
showed that the reported symptoms and those found in the 
literature overlap.
In summary, this study showed that suppressive treatment 
with Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin safely decreased the frequency 
of genital herpes outbreaks. The study also showed that the 
clinical effects of Gene-Eden-VIR/Novirin are mostly better 
than those of ACV, VACV, and FCV.
