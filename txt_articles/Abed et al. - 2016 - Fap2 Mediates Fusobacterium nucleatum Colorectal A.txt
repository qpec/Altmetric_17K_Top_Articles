fusobacterial lectin (Fap2) that explicates
fusobacteria abundance in CRC.
Targeting Fap2 or host Gal-GalNAc may

SUMMARY
Fusobacterium nucleatum is associated with colo-
rectal cancer and promotes colonic tumor formation
in preclinical models. However, fusobacteria are core
members of the human oral microbiome and less
prevalent in the healthy gut, raising questions about
how fusobacteria localize to CRC. We identify a
host polysaccharide and fusobacterial lectin that ex-
plicates fusobacteria abundance in CRC. Gal-Gal-
NAc, which is overexpressed in CRC, is recognized
by fusobacterial Fap2, which functions as a Gal-Gal-
NAc lectin. F. nucleatum binding to clinical adeno-
carcinomas correlates with Gal-GalNAc expression
and is reduced upon O-glycanase treatment. Clinical
fusobacteria strains naturally lacking Fap2 or inacti-
vated Fap2 mutants show reduced binding to Gal-
GalNAc-expressing
CRC
cells
and
established
CRCs in mice. Additionally, intravenously injected
F. nucleatum localizes to mouse tumor tissues in a
Fap2-dependent manner, suggesting that fusobac-
teria use a hematogenous route to reach colon ade-
nocarcinomas. Thus, targeting F. nucleatum Fap2
or host epithelial Gal-GalNAc may reduce fusobacte-
ria potentiation of CRC.
INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third leading cause of cancer-
related deaths in the United States (Siegel et al., 2015), and mi-
crobes have emerged as key factors that influence the develop-
ment, progression, and response to treatment of CRC (Garrett,
2015; Sears and Garrett, 2014; Thomas and Jobin, 2015).
Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis accelerates colon tumor
development by inducing an acute and self-limited colitis trig-
gering an Il-23 and Il-17 inflammatory response in intestinal ad-
enoma-prone ApcMin/+ mice (Wu et al., 2009). Colibactin-ex-
pressing Escherichia coli potentiates colorectal carcinogenesis
in azoxymethane-exposed gnotobiotic Il10�/� mice (Arthur
et al., 2012). In addition, carbohydrate-derived bacterial metab-
olites, such as butyrate, can increase hyperproliferation in
Msh2�/� (DNA mismatch repair gene MutS homolog 2) colon
epithelial cells, in contrast with the ingestion of a low-fiber diet
that reduces tumor numbers in ApcMin/+Msh2�/� mice (Belcheva
et al., 2014). These data reflect a spectrum of ways by which
bacteria contribute to colorectal carcinogenesis.
Recent metagenomic and transcriptomic analyses have re-
vealed an enrichment of Fusobacterium species in human
CRCs and adenomas compared with adjacent normal tissue
(Castellarin et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2012; Flanagan et al.,
2014; Ito et al., 2015; Kostic et al., 2012; McCoy et al., 2013).
Increased levels of F. nucleatum correlate with specific molec-
ular subsets of CRCs such as the CpG island methylator pheno-
type and microsatellite instability (Mima et al., 2015; Tahara et al.,
2014). F. nucleatum accelerates CRC in preclinical models using
both in vitro and in vivo systems (Kostic et al., 2013; Rubinstein
et al., 2013). F. nucleatum also suppresses anti-tumor immunity
and inhibits tumor killing by natural killer (NK) cells (Gur et al.,
2015). All of these findings support that F. nucleatum not only
localizes to and is enriched in colon adenomas and colorectal
adenocarcinoma but also may function in tumor growth and
survival.
However, the mechanism underlying fusobacteria localization
to and enrichment in CRC and colonic adenomas has been un-
clear from previous reports (Castellarin et al., 2012; Kostic

215
 et al., 2012, 2013; Rubinstein et al., 2013). We identify a host fac-
tor D-galactose-b(1-3)-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (Gal-GalNAc)
and a microbial protein, Fap2, that explicates fusobacterial
enrichment in CRC. Herein, we show that Fap2 plays a critical
role in mediating fusobacterial CRC enrichment by binding to
the carbohydrate moiety Gal-GalNAc, which is overexpressed
in human colorectal adenocarcinoma and metastases.
RESULTS
F. nucleatum Attaches to Gal-GalNAc Overexpressed on
CRC
Binding of F. nucleatum to some bacterial and mammalian cells
can be inhibited with sugars containing D-galactose or Gal-
GalNAc (Kolenbrander and Andersen, 1989; Mongiello and Fal-
kler, 1979; Ozaki et al., 1990). Gal-GalNAc can also be expressed
at high levels by adenocarcinomas (Giannasca et al., 1996; Sa-
kuma et al., 2015; Springer, 1984; Yang and Shamsuddin,
1996). These observations led to the hypothesis that colorectal
adenocarcinoma expression of Gal-GalNAc may facilitate bind-
ing of fusobacteria to CRC. To test this hypothesis, we assessed
Gal-GalNAc levels on healthy human colorectal tissues, human
colonic adenomas, and human colorectal adenocarcinomas
by staining tissue microarrays with fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)-labeled peanut agglutinin (PNA), a Gal-GalNAc [Gal - b
(1/3)GalNAc] specific lectin. Gal-GalNAc levels were signifi-
cantly higher in adenocarcinomas compared with adenomas
(Figures 1A and 1B). Intense staining was detected in the adeno-
carcinoma’s epithelial cells, with some variation of staining inten-
sity across tumoral epithelial cells due to plane of section (Fig-
ure 1A). Although adenomas overall seemed to express levels

of Gal-GalNAc similar to healthy tissues
(Figures 1A and 1B), when we considered
the histopathology of the adenomas in
more detail, statistically significant trends
emerged within the adenoma group. Within
our data set, the highest levels of Gal-
GalNAc expression were found on villous
adenomas, followed by tubulous villous adenomas (14-fold dif-
ference, p < 0.0001, ANOVA, Tukey’s multiple comparison
test). Gal-GalNAc differed by 100-fold between villous and
tubular adenomas (p < 0.0001, ANOVA, Tukey’s multiple com-
parison test). Levels of Gal-GalNAc staining were markedly lower
on adenomatoid, hyperplastic, and serrated adenomas (Fig-
ure 1C). Notably, of these histopathologic subtypes, the villous
growth pattern of adenomas has the highest malignant potential.
To determine if colorectal adenocarcinoma Gal-GalNAc levels
may affect F. nucleatum enrichment, we tested if O-glycanase
reduced Gal-GalNAc levels in human colorectal adenocarci-
noma tissue sections. O-glycanase treatment of the human
CRC adenocarcinoma sections reduced FITC-PNA staining by
nearly 7-fold (Figures 2A and 2B). Next, we developed a method
to visualize binding of F. nucleatum ATCC 23726 (Fn) to formalin-
fixed paraffin-embedded human adenocarcinoma samples (Fig-
ure 2C). Fn binding to adenocarcinoma versus normal colonic
tissues correlated with Gal-GalNAc expression levels and
increased 6.1-fold in the colonic adenocarcinoma tissues rela-
tive to normal tissue (p < 0.0001; Figures 2C–2E). Similar to the
observations with O-glycanase treatment and FITC-PNA bind-
ing, fusobacterial attachment to the colorectal adenocarcinoma
specimens decreased in O-glycanase-treated sections (2.96-
fold less, p = 0.0313; Figure 2E).
Fap2 Mediates Attachment of F. nucleatum to Gal-
GalNAc Overexpressed in CRC
Many strains of F. nucleatum (approximately 80%) adhere to
human erythrocytes. In most of these strains, this binding is
strongly inhibited by galactose and GalNAc (Tuttle et al., 1992).
The Fap2 surface protein of F. nucleatum ATCC 23726 is a
216
Cell Host & Microbe 20, 215–225, August 10, 2016
 galactose-binding lectin that mediates fusobacterial hemag-
glutination. Fap2 was identified by screening a F. nucleatum
ATCC 23726 transposon mutant library for clones unable to
hemagglutinate. The selected non-hemagglutinating mutants
K50 and D22 both harbored the transposon in their fap2 gene
(Coppenhagen-Glazer et al., 2015). Because Fap2 mediates
galactose-sensitive fusobacterial binding to erythrocytes, we hy-
pothesized that Fap2 might also mediate binding of F. nucleatum
ATCC 23726 to tumors that overexpress Gal-GalNAc. To test
this hypothesis, we performed hemagglutination assays in the
presence or absence of GalNAc using WT Fn and two Fap2-inac-
tivated mutants, K50 and D22 (Figure 3A). These hemagglutina-
tion data suggest that Fap2 mediates Gal-GalNAc binding by
fusobacteria. Next, we found that GalNAc inhibits binding of
F. nucleatum ATCC 23726 to human CRC tissue sections (Fig-
ures 3B and 3C). Both Fap2-inactivated mutants K50 and D22
display impaired attachment to human colon adenocarcinoma
sections compared with the wild-type F. nucleatum ATCC
23726 parental strain, with a mean overall reduction in abun-
dance of 2.8- and 3.1-fold, respectively (Figures 3D–3G). Similar
to PNA binding (Figure 1B), attachment of F. nucleatum ATCC
23726 to adenoma sections overall is not different from binding
to normal colon tissues, nor is it different from K50 mutant bind-
ing (Figure 3E). In addition, fluorescence microscopy analysis
of human CRC sections demonstrates co-localization (81.6%)
of FITC-labeled Fap2-expressing F. nucleatum ATCC 23726
with tumor Gal-GalNAc detected in tumor sections from three in-
dividuals (visualized with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated PNA and
FITC-labeled F. nucleatum ATCC 23726) (Figure 3H). These
data support that F. nucleatum Fap2 and tumor-expressed
Gal-GalNAc play an important role in F. nucleatum CRC enrich-
ment and localization.
To confirm that fusobacterial attachment to CRC is Gal-
GalNAc mediated, we used both flow cytometry and competition
assays. Flow cytometry analysis of the attachment of FITC-
labeled F. nucleatum ATCC 23726 to human and mouse CRC
cell lines revealed a correlation between bacterial attachment
and cell line Gal-GalNAc expression levels measured using
FITC-labeled PNA. Human HCT116 colon carcinoma cells, which
expressed the highest amounts of Gal-GalNAc (mean 87.7% of
cells binding PNA above threshold; Figure 4A), bind the highest
amounts of fusobacteria (mean 87.9% of cells binding above
threshold; Figure 4A). Mouse CT26 and human RKO CRC cells,
expressing intermediate levels of Gal-GalNAc (means 74.6%

intermediate
amounts
of
F. nucleatum ATCC 23726 (means 71.8% and 64.8%, respec-
tively; Figure 4A). Human HT29 CRC cells that express low
levels of Gal-GalNAc (mean 1.43%) demonstrate lower (mean
18.6%) fusobacterial attachment levels. Furthermore, binding of
F. nucleatum ATCC 23726 to the high and intermediate Gal-
GalNAc-expressing cell lines is inhibited by GalNAc in a statisti-
callysignificant,dose-dependentmanner(p=0.04167;Figure4A).
These findings corroborate the importance of the Gal-GalNAc
moiety for the attachment of the fusobacteria we evaluated. In
agreement with the results demonstrating the role of Fap2 in fuso-
bacterial attachment to CRC sections (Figures 3D–3G), both
Fap2-inactivated F. nucleatum ATCC 23726 mutants K50 and
D22 have significantly impaired attachment to the high and inter-
mediate Gal-GalNAc-expressing CRC cell lines, compared with
the wild-type parental strain (p < 0.01; Figure 4A). The residual
binding of K50 and D22 to the CRC cells is not GalNAc sensitive,
confirming the role of Fap2 in Gal-GalNAc-mediated F. nucleatum
ATCC 23726 CRC attachment. This residual binding may be
FadA-mediated (Coppenhagen-Glazer et al., 2015; Han et al.,
2005). Binding of both Fap2 mutants to the HCT116 cells is higher
than to the other tested cells suggesting that this cell line may ex-
press additional fusobacterial-binding ligands.
We also tested if Gal-GalNAc mediates CRC-binding by
F. nucleatum strains CTI-2 and CTI-7, which were isolated
from human CRC samples (Gur et al., 2015). Although CTI-2

 possesses the fap2 gene and its hemagglutination is inhibited by
GalNAc, fap2 is not found in CTI-7’s genome and CTI-7 does not
hemagglutinate (Figure S1). Although both strains bind the low
Gal-GalNAc-expressing HT-29 CRC cells in a similar manner,
binding of CTI-2 to the high and intermediate Gal-GalNAc-ex-
pressing HCT116, CT26, and RKO CRC cells is significantly
higher than that of the non-hemagglutinating, naturally Fap2-
deficient CTI-7 (p < 0.01; Figure 4B). Binding of CTI-2 to the
high and intermediate Gal-GalNAc-expressing CRC cells is in-
hibited by the addition of soluble GalNAc in a dose-dependent
manner (p = 0.04167; Figure 4B), but binding of the Fap2-defi-
cient CTI-7 is not (Figure 4B). Correlation between Fap2 expres-
sion (detected by hemagglutination; Figure S1) and attachment
to GalNAc-expressing CRC cell lines is also observed in four
additional CRC F. nucleatum isolates, two F. nucleatum oral
strains, and one F. nucleatum strain isolated from a patient
with inflammatory bowel disease (Figure 4C).
Blood-Borne F. nucleatum Preferentially Colonizes
Colorectal Tumors
We hypothesized that fusobacteria that colonize CRC originate
from the oral cavity, as fusobacteria are core resident members
of the human oral microbiome and are found infrequently in the
gut (Human Microbiome Project Consortium, 2012; Dewhirst
et al., 2010; Faust et al., 2012; Strauss et al., 2011). Previously
in ApcMin/+ mice, we observed that oral daily inoculation of fuso-
bacteria enhanced adenoma development in the large intestine
and that fusobacteria are detectable in these tumor by qPCR
and fluorescence in situ hybridization (Kostic et al., 2013). Tran-
sient bacteremia is common during periodontal disease with
bacterial loads reaching 104 bacteria/ml blood 15 min after
tooth brushing in humans (Ashare et al., 2009). Thus, transient
bacteremia enables access of oral fusobacteria to the circula-
tory system. To test whether blood-borne fusobacteria can
localize to CRC, we used the orthotopic rectal CT26 adenocar-
cinoma model (Kolodkin-Gal et al., 2009) (Figure 5A). We in-
jected CT26 cells stably transfected with the luciferase (luc)
gene (CT26-luc) under the mucosa of the distal rectum of
BALB/cJ wild-type mice and assessed tumor volume and
spread both by real-time imaging of luciferase expression and
by direct measurement of rectal tumors. Once tumor volumes
reached 2,500 mm3, mice were randomized to a control
group or inoculated with 5 3 106 to 1 3 107 F. nucleatum
ATCC 23726 by tail vein injection. Tumors and adjacent non-
cancerous colon samples were harvested 24 hr post-inocula-
tion. Consistent with the samples from human colon adenocar-
cinoma, Gal-GalNAc (measured using FITC-labeled PNA) is
overexpressed in the mouse CRC sections compared with sec-
tions prepared from adjacent normal colon tissues (Figures 5B
and 5C). In agreement with prior work in mouse models and hu-
mans (Kostic et al., 2012, 2013), the abundance of fusobacteria
in tumor tissues is significantly higher than in adjacent normal
tissues both by plating and qPCR (p = 0.0005 and p = 0.0117,
respectively; Figures 5D and 5E). Also, intravenously inoculated
fusobacteria are not found in the colons of control mice without
CRC (Figures 5D and 5E), suggesting that the presence of
dysplastic or neoplastic lesions assists or is required for colonic
localization of blood-borne fusobacteria. We also performed tail
vein injection of fusobacteria in ApcMin/+ mice. In these experi-
ments, we injected mice after the 12th week of age to ensure
that the mice would have ample numbers of small intestinal
adenomas. In our mouse facility, we very rarely observe colonic
adenomas of ApcMin/+ mice without fusobacterial inoculation.

hours

injection,
we
detect
wild-type
F. nucleatum ATCC 23726 in small intestinal tissues from
C57BL/6 ApcMin/+ mice by qPCR in 11 of 12 samples (91.7%)
and 0 of 6 samples from C57BL/6 wild-type mice (Table S1).
When we injected C57BL/6 ApcMin/+ and wild-type mice with
K50, F. nucleatum is detected in 9 of 16 (56%) and 0 of 6 sam-
ples, respectively. Thus, colonization of the Fap2-expressing
wild-type strain (91.7%) is significantly higher than that of K50
(9 of 16 [56%]) (p = 0.022, Mann-Whitney U test) (Table S1).
These data indicate that Fap2 plays a role in F. nucleatum tumor
enrichment in this model; however, the small intestinal localiza-
tion of these tumors as well as the fact that ApcMin/+ adenoma
histology does not fully recapitulate the spectrum of human
colonic adenoma histology complicates interpretation and
application to humans.
Tumor colonization does not appear to be a general feature
of oral anaerobic bacteria associated with periodontitis. Por-
phyromonas gingivalis, is an oral Gram-negative, anaerobic peri-
odontal bacterium (Hajishengallis et al., 2011) that was previ-
ously found to be overabundant in gingival squamous cell
carcinoma (Gao et al., 2016; Katz et al., 2011; Whitmore and La-
mont, 2014). When mice were intravenously inoculated with
P. gingivalis, its levels in tumors are below the limit of detection
both by culturing (�10 CFU/gr tissue) and qPCR (Figures 5D
and 5E). Thus, F. nucleatum likely harbors distinctive features

 that underpin its tumor localization, such as Fap2 the focus of
this work and FadA (Rubinstein et al., 2013).
Fap2 Mediates CRC Colonization by F. nucleatum in the
CT26 CRC Model
We also used the orthotopic CT26 CRC model to evaluate the
role of Fap2 in CRC localization by fusobacteria. Mice were inoc-
ulated with wild-type (Fap2-expressing) F. nucleatum ATCC
23726 or with the Fap2-inactivated mutant D22. CRC coloniza-
tion by the Fap2-deficient mutant D22 is significantly lower than
that of the Fap2 sufficient ATCC 23726 parental strain as deter-
mined both by colony counting (45.6-fold less, p < 0.0001; Fig-
ure 4F) and by qPCR (10.1-fold less, p = 0.0002; Figures 5F and
5G). Moreover, although CRC colonization by the Fap2 express-
ing F. nucleatum ATCC 23726 strain is significantly higher than
that of the adjacent normal colon (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0008, Fig-
ures 4F and 4G, respectively), CRC colonization by D22 is not
(Figures 5F and 5G). Co-challenge with ATCC 23726 and the
other Fap2 mutant K50 co-injected into the CRC mouse model,
confirm the involvement of Fap2 in CRC colonization by
F. nucleatum ATCC 23726 (mean of competition index 25.5,
p = 0.0046; Figure 5H). Using human colonic adenocarcinoma
isolates, we found that the Fap2-expressing CTI-2 strain (Fig-
ure S1) is abundant in the tumors; however the Fap2-deficient
CTI-7 strain is not detected in the tumors by plating (Figure 5I)
and qPCR (Figure 5J). These results imply that although
neoplastic tissues play a critical role in fusobacterial tumor
enrichment, fusobacterial CRC-specific enrichment is also
Fap2 dependent. These results also raise the question if there
are excessive fitness costs to maintain Fap2 once F. nucleatum
is established in a tumor, given Fap2’s loss in the CTI-7 strain.
We next evaluated if fusobacteria could localize to CRC
metastasis and whether this localization is Gal-GalNAc-Fap2
mediated. We detected F. nucleatum in human CRC metastases
by qPCR (Figure 6A; 10 of 12 tested metastases), consistent with
prior preliminary observations (Kostic et al., 2012), but we do not
detect fusobacteria in 6 of 7 samples taken from tumor-free liver
biopsies (Figure 6A). Interestingly, we found Gal-GalNAc expres-
sion in the 1 tumor-free liver sample (a fibrotic cyst) in which
fusobacteria is detected (Figure S2). Presence of fusobacteria
in CRC-metastasis colonization appears to be specific insofar
as genomic DNA (gDNA) of P. gingivalis is not detected in the
tested samples. Similar to primary colon adenocarcinoma, Gal-
GalNAc is overexpressed (in comparison with adjacent normal
tissue) in all of the tested metastases, from a variety of organs
(Figures 6B and 6C). As we observed in CRC primary tumors,
ex vivo binding of F. nucleatum ATCC 23726 to CRC metastases
sections was Fap2 dependent, with reduced attachment of the
Fap2-inactivated mutant K50 compared with wild-type (Figures
6D, 6E, and S3).
DISCUSSION
There is a growing interest in the role of bacteria in cancer biology
and special interest in F. nucleatum in colorectal carcinogenesis.
Although fusobacteria are found in CRC, to date, the mecha-
nisms by which fusobacteria home and localize to colorectal tu-
mors have been under-explored. Herein, using human CRC sam-
ples and an orthotopic mouse CRC model, we found that tumors
and their metastases possess specific glycans that underlie fuso-
bacterial tumor enrichment. Undoubtedly, other factors, such
as tumor hypoxia and the tumor-immune microenvironment,
contribute to a niche that allows for fusobacterial survival. How-
ever, these local environmental conditions were not sufficient
to enable localization of another oral anaerobic bacterium,
P. gingivalis, in CRC. Therefore, it seems that specific factors
and mechanisms are required for CRC colonization by bacteria.
Binding between the fusobacterial adhesin FadA and host
epithelial E-cadherin may enable fusobacterial attachment to
CRC (Rubinstein et al., 2013). However, E-cadherin is expressed
on many cell types (Frixen et al., 1991; Heng and Painter, 2008),
and its expression levels and cellular localization patterns
in dysplasia and neoplasia can vary (Jiang et al., 2015;
Schmalhofer et al., 2009). Thus its binding may not fully explain
F. nucleatum’s tropism to CRC. Furthermore, not all human
colon adenomas and adenocarcinomas express E-cadherin;
nor do CT26 cells, which we used in our orthotopic CRC mouse
model experiments (Grossi and Genco, 1998; Langlois et al.,
2010). Thus our experiments support that additional mecha-
nisms, specifically fusobacterial Fap2 and host Gal-GalNAc,
are involved in fusobacterial CRC localization and enrichment.
Fap2 has multiple functions that may facilitate fusobacterial
adaptation to different body habitats. In the oral cavity, Fap2 is
mainly involved in attachment to neighboring bacteria (co-adher-
ence) in a manner that bridges different species and increases
the diversity and the stability of the developing dental plaque
(Coppenhagen-Glazer et al., 2015; Kolenbrander and London,
1993). We also recently found that Fap2-deficient mutants are
impaired in placental colonization (Coppenhagen-Glazer et al.,
2015). In the colon, our data suggest that Fap2 mediates adeno-
carcinoma-specific binding through attachment to Gal-GalNAc,
which we observed is expressed at high levels in CRC. Similar
to CRC, the placenta has also been shown to overexpress Gal-
GalNAc (Richter et al., 2000).
In tumors, we recently showed that Fap2 mediates fusobacte-
rial-driven impairment of host anti-tumor immunity. Fap2 binds
and activates TIGIT (Yu et al., 2009) an immunoregulatory
signaling receptor in T cells and NK cells. This Fap2-TIGIT inter-
action reduces killing of tumor cells by NK and tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes (Gur et al., 2015). Fap2 has also been reported to
induce lymphocyte apoptosis (Kaplan et al., 2005, 2010).
Although all of the oral isolates we examined herein expressed
Fap2 and hemagglutinate, only three of the six CRC isolates are
able to hemagglutinate (Figure S2). This may imply that Fap2-
dependent attachment is selected for under the constant flow
conditions of the oral cavity where surface attachment is vital;
however, in tumors, after fusobacterial attachment and estab-
lishment in the adenocarcinoma niche, the selective pressure
for Fap2 may be lost. In the future, it will be interesting to perform
comparative genomic studies of fusobacterial isolates from the
oral cavity, adenomas, adenocarcinomas, and metastatic sites
in conjunction with host genomic profiling to understand the
selective pressure that host tissue site exert on fusobacteria
and that fusobacteria exert on host tissues.
In summary, our results unveil a host factor (Gal-GalNAc) and a
microbial lectin (Fap2) that mediates fusobacterial enrichment in
CRC in human tissues, human and mouse CRC cell lines, and a
preclinical orthotopic CRC model as well as in human CRC
222

 metastases. Our findings support that targeting F. nucleatum
Fap2 or host epithelial Gal-GalNAc expression may provide a
means to block F. nucleatum potentiation of CRC and afford
diagnostic opportunities as well.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Collection of Clinical Samples
The Hadassah Medical School institutional review board approved the use
of human samples for this study. Informed consent was obtained from all pa-
tients. CRC metastases from five frozen and seven formalin-fixed paraffin-
embedded blocks were collected from the Israel Collaborative Biorepository
for Research (MIDGAM). Seven tumor-free liver tissue samples were collected
from the pathology department at Hadassah Medical School.
Tissue Microarray Analysis
Colon cancer tissue array CO2601 (US Biomax) and array CO809a (US
Biomax) were used in these studies. Details about the cases for each core
on the array are available on the US Biomax Web site.
Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions
F. nucleatum strains ATCC 23726, K50, D22, ATCC 10953, PK 1594, CTI-1,
CTI-2, CTI-3, CTI-5, CTI-6, CTI-7, EAVG_002, and P. gingivalis ATCC 33277
were cultured as described in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Regarding the use of the K50 and D22, two mutants strains derived from
ATCC 23726 with a disrupted and inactive fap2 gene (Coppenhagen-Glazer
et al., 2015), after Figure 2A, given the similarity in phenotype these strains
are used interchangeably in subsequent experiments.
Cell Lines and Tissue Culture
CT26 stably transfected with the luciferase (luc) gene (CT26-luc), the human
colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT29, RKO, and HCT116 were cultured ac-
cording to ATCC guidelines. These cells were kind gifts from Professors Panet
(CT26-luc), Ben-Neriah (HT29), Mandelboim (RKO), and Hoffman (HCT116).
Murine CRC Model
All experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of our insti-
tution’s animal welfare committee. The orthotopic rectal cancer model was
performed as described (Kolodkin-Gal et al., 2009) in wild-type BALB/cJ

ment, see Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Bacterial Inoculations
Mice were inoculated with 5 3 106 to 1 3 107 bacteria (washed with PBS twice)
via tail vein injection. For C57BL/6J wild-type and ApcMin+/� mice, mice were
aged beyond 12 weeks and then intravenously injected with �5 3 108 pre-
washed bacteria.
Quantification of Bacteria Using Plating and qPCR
Tissue samples were homogenized using a Fastprep (MP Biomedicals) and
plated as described in Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Colonies
were enumerated after 6 days of incubation under anaerobic conditions. See
Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details of DNA preparation and
qPCR of homogenized tissue.
Flow Cytometry and Competition Assays
FITC-labeled F. nucleatum were incubated with cells at a MOI of 10 for 30 min
at room temperature. FITC-labeled PNA lectin (Sigma-Aldrich) was incubated
at a final concentration of 140 nM per 2.5 3 105 cells. For competition
experiments, bacteria or PNA was incubated with GalNAc (concentration
range 0, 50, 100, and 300 mM) for 30 min prior to incubation with cells.
For flow cytometry methods and analysis, see Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
Immunofluorescence and Section Preparation
Fixed tissue sections were stained with H&E or processed for immunofluores-
cence microscopy as described below. Sections were blocked and incubated
with fluorescent PNA or fluorescent bacteria as described in Supplemental
Experimental Procedures. GalNAc removal was performed by incubating
sections with O-glycanase; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for
experimental details. Imaging analysis is described in Supplemental Experi-
mental Procedures.
Hemagglutination Assays
Hemagglutination assays were performed as previously described (Coppen-
hagen-Glazer et al., 2015). For inhibition assays, washed bacteria were pre-
incubated with 25 mM GalNAc (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min prior to incubation
with erythrocytes.
