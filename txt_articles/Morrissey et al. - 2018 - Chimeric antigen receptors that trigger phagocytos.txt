 Abstract  
 
Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are synthetic receptors that reprogram T cells to kill 
cancer. The success of CAR-T cell therapies highlights the promise of programmed 
immunity, and suggests that applying CAR strategies to other immune cell lineages may 
be beneficial. Here, we engineered a family of Chimeric Antigen Receptors for 
Phagocytosis (CAR-Ps) that direct macrophages to engulf specific targets, including 
cancer cells. CAR-Ps consist of an extracellular antibody fragment, which can be 
modified to direct CAR-P activity towards specific antigens. By screening a panel of 
engulfment receptor intracellular domains, we found that the cytosolic domains from 
Megf10 and FcRɣ robustly triggered engulfment independently of their native 
extracellular domain. We show that CAR-Ps drive specific engulfment of antigen-coated 
synthetic particles and whole cancer cells. Addition of a tandem PI3K recruitment 
domain increased cancer cell engulfment. Finally, we show that CAR-P expressing 
macrophages reduce cancer cell number in co-culture by over 40%.  
 
Summary (15-30 words)  
 
We report the first Chimeric Antigen Receptors for Phagocytosis (CAR-Ps) that promote 
engulfment of antigen-coated particles and cancer cells.

 Introduction 
 
Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are synthetic transmembrane receptors that redirect 
T cell activity towards clinically relevant targets (reviewed in (Lim et al. 2017; Fesnak, 
June, and Levine 2016)). The CAR-T receptor contains an extracellular single chain 
antibody fragment (scFv) that recognizes known tumor antigens, and intracellular 
signaling domains from the T Cell Receptor (TCR) and costimulatory molecules that 
trigger T cell activation (Fesnak, June, and Levine 2016; Kochenderfer et al. 2009). 
CAR-T cells recognizing CD19, a marker expressed at high levels on the surface of B 
cells and B cell-derived malignancies, have been used successfully to target 
hematological malignancies with 70-90% of patients showing measurable improvement 
(Lim et al. 2017; Engel et al. 1995; Haso et al. 2013). The success of CAR-T suggests 
that programming immune cells to target cancer might be a broadly applicable 
approach.  
 
Macrophages are critical effectors of the innate immune system, responsible for 
engulfing debris and pathogens. Harnessing macrophages to combat tumor growth is of 
longstanding interest (C. Alvey and Discher 2017; Lee et al. 2016). Macrophages are 
uniquely capable of penetrating solid tumors, while other immune cells, like T cells, are 
physically excluded or inactivated (Lim et al. 2017; Lee et al. 2016). This suggests that 
engineered macrophages may augment existing T cell-based therapies. Early efforts 
transferring healthy macrophages into cancer patients failed to inhibit tumor growth, 
suggesting that macrophages require additional signals to direct their activity towards 
tumors (Lacerna, Stevenson, and Stevenson 1988; Andreesen et al. 1990). Antibody 
blockade of CD47, a negative regulator of phagocytosis, reduced tumor burden, 
indicating that shifting the balance in favor of macrophage activation and engulfment is 
a promising therapeutic avenue (Majeti et al. 2009; Chao et al. 2010; Jaiswal et al. 
2009; Tseng et al. 2013). Here, we report a family of chimeric antigen receptors that 
activate phagocytosis of cancer cells based on recognition of defined cell surface 
markers, resulting in significantly reduced cancer cell growth.

Results 
 
To program engulfment towards a target antigen, we created a CAR strategy using the 
CAR-T design as a guide (Fesnak, June, and Levine 2016). We call this new class of 
synthetic receptors Chimeric Antigen Receptors for Phagocytosis (CAR-Ps). The CAR-
P molecules contain the extracellular single-chain antibody variable fragment (scFv) 
recognizing the B cell antigen CD19 (ɑCD19) and the CD8 transmembrane domain 
present in the ɑCD19 CAR-T (Fesnak, June, and Levine 2016; Kochenderfer et al. 
2009). To identify cytoplasmic domains capable of promoting phagocytosis, we 
screened a library of known murine phagocytic receptors: Megf10 (Fig. 1a), the 
common ɣ subunit of Fc receptors (FcRɣ), Bai1, and MerTK  (Penberthy and 
Ravichandran 2016). FcR triggers engulfment of antibody-bound particles, while the 
other receptors recognize apoptotic corpses (Freeman and Grinstein 2014; Penberthy 
and Ravichandran 2016). We also made a receptor containing an extracellular ɑCD19 
antibody fragment and a cytoplasmic GFP, but no signaling domain, to test whether 
adhesion mediated by the ɑCD19 antibody fragment is sufficient to induce engulfment 
(Fig. 1a; CAR-PGFP).  
 
To assay our library of CAR-Ps, we introduced each CAR-P into J774A.1 macrophages 
by lentiviral infection. As an engulfment target, we used 5 µm diameter silica beads 
coated with a supported lipid bilayer. A His8-tagged extracellular domain of CD19 was 
bound to a NiNTA-lipid incorporated into the supported lipid bilayers. Macrophages 
expressing a CAR-P with the Megf10 (CAR-PMegf10) or FcRɣ (CAR-PFcRɣ) intracellular 
domain promoted significant engulfment of CD19 beads compared to macrophages with 
no CAR (Fig. 1b, c; Video 1). Macrophages expressing CAR-PBai1, CAR-PMerTK, and the 
adhesion-only CAR-PGFP did not bind the CD19 beads even though these CAR-Ps are 
present at the cell surface (Fig. 1b, c; Supplementary Fig. 1).

 Next we asked if the CAR-P strategy could target a different antigen. Because CAR-
PMegf10 performed well in our initial screen, we developed ɑCD22 CAR-PMegf10 using a 
previously developed ɑCD22 antibody fragment (Fig. 1a) (Xiao et al. 2009; Haso et al. 
2013). Consistent with our results using ɑCD19-based CARs, ɑCD22 CAR-PMegf10 
promoted engulfment of CD22 beads (Fig. 2a). To confirm antigen specificity of CAR-P, 
we incubated ɑCD19 CAR-PMegf10 macrophages with CD22 beads, and ɑCD22 CAR-
PMegf10 macrophages with CD19 beads. CD19 beads were not eaten by ɑCD22 CAR-
PMegf10 macrophages, and CD22 beads were not eaten by ɑCD19 CAR-PMegf10 
macrophages (Fig. 2a). These data indicate that CAR-PMegf10 specifically triggers 
engulfment in response to the target ligand and that the CAR-P strategy is able to target 
multiple cancer antigens.  
 
To further define the capabilities of the CAR-P, we assessed the capacity of CAR-P-
expressing macrophages to engulf variably sized targets. We found that CAR-PMegf10 
was able to trigger specific engulfment of beads ranging from 2.5 µm to 20 µm in 
diameter, with higher specificity above background engulfment being demonstrated for 
the larger beads (Fig. 2b).  
 
To determine if the CAR-PMegf10 initiates active signaling at the synapse between the 
macrophage and target, we stained for phosphotyrosine. Macrophages expressing 
CAR-PMegf10 exhibited an increase in phosphotyrosine at the synapse, while 
macrophages expressing CAR-PGFP did not show this enrichment (Fig. 3a). This result 
suggests that CAR-PMegf10 initiates engulfment through a localized signaling cascade 
involving tyrosine phosphorylation.  
 
Both successful CAR-P intracellular domains (from FcRɣ and Megf10) have cytosolic 
Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Activation Motifs (ITAMs) that are phosphorylated by 
Src family kinases. Based on this observation, we hypothesized that the expression of 
an alternate ITAM-containing receptor might initiate phagocytosis when expressed in 
macrophages. The CD3ζ subunit of the T cell receptor contains three ITAM motifs. To 
test if the CD3ζ chain was able to activate phagocytic signaling, we transduced

 macrophages with the first generation CAR-T (Fig. 3b). The CAR-T was able to trigger 
engulfment of CD19 beads to a comparable extent as CAR-PMegf10 (Fig. 3b). In T cells, 
phosphorylated ITAMs in CD3ζ bind to tandem SH2 domains (tSH2) in the kinase 
ZAP70. Zap70 is not expressed in macrophages, but Syk, a phagocytic signaling 
effector and tSH2 domain containing protein, is expressed at high levels  (Andreu et al. 
2017). Previous work suggested that Syk kinase can also bind to the CD3ζ ITAMs (Bu, 
Shaw, and Chan 1995), indicating that the CAR-T may promote engulfment through a 
similar mechanism as CAR-PFcRɣ. To quantitatively compare the interaction between 
SyktSH2 and CD3ζ or FcRɣ in a membrane proximal system recapitulating physiological 
geometry, we a used liposome-based assay (Fig. 3c (Hui and Vale 2014)). In this 
system, His10-CD3ζ and His10-Lck (the kinase that phosphorylates CD3ζ) are bound to a 
liposome via NiNTA-lipids and the binding of labeled tandem SH2 domains to 
phosphorylated CD3ζ was measured using fluorescence quenching. Our results show 
that Syk-tSH2 binds the CD3ζ and FcRɣ with comparable affinity (~15 nM and ~30 nM 
respectively, Fig. 3c). Collectively, these results demonstrate that the TCR CD3ζ chain 
can promote phagocytosis in a CAR-P, likely through the recruitment of Syk kinase.  
 
We next sought to program engulfment towards a cellular target. We incubated the 
CAR-PMegf10 and CAR-PFcRɣ macrophages with cancerous Raji B cells that express high 
levels of endogenous CD19. Strikingly, the majority of CAR-P-expressing macrophages 
internalized bites of the target cell (Fig. 4a, Video 2, 78% of CAR-PMegf10 and 85% of 
CAR-PFcRɣ macrophages internalized bites within 90 min). The biting phenotype 
resembles trogocytosis, or nibbling of live cells, which has been reported previously in 
immune cells (Joly and Hudrisier 2003). This process was dependent on the ITAM-
bearing intracellular signaling domain, as removing the signaling domain (CAR-PGFP) 
dramatically reduced trogocytosis (Fig. 4a). Enrichment of phosphotyrosine at the cell-
cell synapse further supports active signaling initiating trogocytosis (Supplementary Fig. 
2). The CAR-P module also was able to induce trogocytosis in non-professional 
phagocytes, NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells (Supplementary Fig. 3). This suggests that the 
CAR-P can promote cancer antigen-dependent engulfment by both professional and 
non-professional phagocytes.

We next focused on engineering strategies to engulf whole cancer cells. We observed 
that macrophages expressing the CAR-PMegf10 or CAR-PFcRɣ were capable of engulfing 
whole cells (2 cancer cells eaten per 100 macrophages in a 4-8 hr window for both 
CAR-PMegf10 or CAR-PFcRɣ, Fig 4b,e, Video 3). Whole cell engulfment was infrequent but 
trogocytosis was robust, suggesting that even productive macrophage target 
interactions were frequently insufficient to trigger whole cell engulfment. We 
hypothesized that combining signaling motifs in a tandem array might increase the 
frequency of whole cell engulfment by specifically recruiting effectors required for the 
engulfment of large targets. Previous work demonstrated that PI3K signaling is 
important for internalization of large targets (Schlam et al. 2015). To increase PI3K 
recruitment to the CAR-P, we fused the portion of the CD19 cytoplasmic domain (amino 
acids 500 to 534) that recruits the p85 subunit of PI3K to the CAR-PFcRɣ creating a 
“tandem” CAR (CAR-Ptandem, Fig 4c) (Tuveson et al 1993, Brooks et al 2004). A CAR-P 
containing the p85 recruitment motif alone (CAR-PPI3K) was able to induce some whole 
cell engulfment, comparable to the CAR-PFcRɣ (Fig 4e). Expression of CAR-Ptandem 
tripled the ability of macrophages to ingest whole cells compared to CAR-PGFP (6 cancer 
cells eaten per 100 macrophages, Fig. 4d,e, Video 4). These data indicate that 
assembling an array of motifs designed to recruit distinct phagocytic effectors can 
increase CAR-P activity towards whole cells.  
 
To determine if the combination of whole cell eating and trogocytosis was sufficient to 
drive a noticeable reduction in cancer cell number, we incubated CAR-P macrophages 
with Raji B cells for two days. After 44 hr of co-culture, we found that CAR-P 
macrophages significantly reduced the number of Raji cells (Fig 4f). Although the CAR-
Ptandem was much more efficient at whole cell eating, the CAR-PFcRɣ performed nearly as 
well at eliminating Rajis. Importantly, our assay does not distinguish between whole cell 
engulfment or death following trogocytosis, so it is possible both CAR-P activities are 
contributing to Raji death rates. Overall, this data suggests that the CAR-P is a 
successful strategy for directing macrophages towards cancer targets, and can initiate 
whole cell eating and trogocytosis leading to cancer cell elimination.

In summary, we engineered phagocytes that recognize and ingest targets through 
specific antibody-mediated interactions. This strategy can be directed towards multiple 
extracellular ligands (CD19 and CD22) and can be used with several intracellular 
signaling domains that contain ITAM motifs (Megf10, FcRɣ, and CD3ζ). Previous work 
has suggested that spatial segregation between Src-family kinases and an inhibitory 
phosphatase, driven by receptor ligation, is sufficient to trigger signaling by the T cell 
receptor (Davis and van der Merwe 2006; James and Vale 2012) and FcR  (Freeman et 
al. 2016). The CAR-Ps that we have developed may similarly convert receptor-ligand 
binding into receptor phosphorylation of ITAM domains through partitioning of kinases 
and phosphatases at the membrane-membrane interface.  
 
Further development of CAR-Ps could be useful on several therapeutic fronts. Targeting 
of tumor cells by macrophages has been suggested to cause tumor cell killing (Jaiswal 
et al. 2009; Majeti et al. 2009; Chao et al. 2010; Jadus et al. 1996), either through 
directly engulfing cancer cells or by stimulating antigen presentation and a T cell-
mediated response (Liu et al. 2015; Tseng et al. 2013). Inhibition of the CD47-SIRPA 
“Don’t eat me” signaling pathway has also been shown to result in engulfment of cancer 
cells (Chen et al. 2017; Gardai et al. 2005; Jaiswal et al. 2009; Majeti et al. 2009; Chao 
et al. 2010). A recent study suggests that CD47 inhibition is most effective when 
combined with a positive signal to promote target engulfment, which raises the 
possibility of combining CAR-P expression with CD47 or SIRPA inhibition for an additive 
effect (Alvey et al. 2017).  
 
Although we were able to increase whole cell engulfment by recruiting the activating 
subunit of PI3K to the phagocytic synapse, the engulfment of larger 20 micron beads 
was more frequent than the engulfment of whole cells.  We hypothesize that this is due 
to differing physical properties of the engulfment target.  Specifically, increased target 
stiffness has been shown to promote engulfment, suggesting that manipulating the

 physical properties of the engulfment target could also be a potential strategy for 
increasing CAR-P efficiency (Beningo and Wang 2002; Cross et al. 2007). 
 
While the CAR-P can engulf whole, viable cancer cells, the ingestion of a piece of the 
target cell is more common. Trogocytosis, or nibbling of living cells, has also been 
described in immune cells  (Harshyne et al. 2003; Harshyne et al. 2001; Kao et al. 2006; 
Joly and Hudrisier 2003; Batista, Iber, and Neuberger 2001) and brain-eating amoebae 
(Ralston et al. 2014). In vivo studies also have shown that endogenous dendritic cell 
populations ingest bites of live tumor cells, contributing to presentation of cancer neo-
antigen (Harshyne et al. 2001; Harshyne et al. 2003). Although we were able to use the 
CAR-P to induce trogocytosis in dendritic cells, we were not able to detect robust cross 
presentation of the model antigen ovalbumin (Fig S4). Thus, although using CAR-Ps to 
enhance cross presentation of cancer antigen is an intriguing future avenue, such a 
strategy would likely require more optimization of the dendritic cell subset employed or 
the CAR-P receptor itself.  
 
Overall, our study demonstrates that the CAR approach is transferrable to biological 
processes beyond T cell activation and that the expression of an engineered receptor in 
phagocytic cells is sufficient to promote specific engulfment and elimination of cancer 
cells.

Constructs and Antibodies 
Detailed information for all constructs can be found in Supplemental Excel File 1, 
“Constructs” tab. This file includes the following information for all receptors developed 
in this study: signal peptide, extracellular antibody fragment, stalk/transmembrane 
domain, and cytosolic tail including appropriate accession numbers. Antibodies used in 
this study are described in Supplemental Excel File 1, “Antibodies” tab.  
 
Cell culture 
J774A.1 macrophages and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were obtained from the UCSF cell 
culture facility and cultured in DMEM (Gibco, Catalog #11965-092) supplemented with 1 
x Pen-Strep-Glutamine (Corning, Catalog #30-009-Cl) and 10% fetal bovine serum 
(FBS) (Atlanta Biologicals, Catalog #S11150H). Raji B cells were obtained from J. Blau 
(McManus lab, UCSF) and cultured in RPMI (Gibco, Catalog #11875-093) 
supplemented with 1 x Pen-Strep-Glutamine (Corning, Catalog #30-009-Cl), 10% FBS 
(Atlanta Biologicals, Catalog #S11150H), 10mM HEPES (Gibco, Catalog #1530080), 
and 5 µM 2-Mercaptoethanol (Sigma, Catalog #M6250-100mL). All cell lines used in this 
study were tested for Mycoplasma at least once per month using the Lonza MycoAlert 
Detection Kit (Lonza, Catalog# LT07-318) and control set (Lonza, Catalog #LT07-518).  
 
Lentivirus production and infection 
Lentiviral infection was used to stably express CAR-P constructs in all cell types. 
Lentivirus was produced by HEK293T cells transfected with pMD2.G (a gift from Didier 
Tronon, Addgene plasmid # 12259 containing the VSV-G envelope protein), pCMV-
dR8.91 (since replaced by 2nd generation compatible pCMV-dR8.2, Addgene plasmid 
#8455), and a lentiviral backbone vector containing the construct of interest (derived 
from pHRSIN-CSGW) using lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen, Catalog # 15338-100). The 
media on the HEK293T cells was replaced with fresh media 8-16 hours post 
transfection to remove transfection reagent. At 50-72 hr post-transfection, the lentiviral 
media was filtered with a 0.45 µm filter and concentrated by centrifugation at 8,000 x g

 for 4 hr or overnight. The concentrated supernatant was applied directly to ~0.5 x 106 
NIH 3T3 cells in 2 ml of fresh media. For J77A4.1 macrophages and Raji B cells, the 
concentrated supernatant was mixed with 2 mls of media and 2 µg lipofectamine 
(Invitrogen, Catalog # 18324-012) and added to the cells. The cells were spun at 2,200 
x g for 45 min at 37C. Cells were analyzed a minimum of 72 hr later.  
 
Preparation of CD19 and CD22 5 µm silica beads 
Chloroform-suspended lipids were mixed in the following molar ratio using clean 
glasstight Hamilton syringes (Hamilton, Catalog #8 1100): 97% POPC (Avanti, Catalog 
# 850457), 2% Ni2+-DGS-NTA (Avanti, Catalog # 790404), 0.5% PEG5000-PE (Avanti, 
Catalog # 880230, and 0.5% atto390-DOPE (ATTO-TEC GmbH, Catalog # AD 390-
161). Lipid mixes were dried under argon and desiccated overnight under foil. Dried 
lipids were resuspended in 1 ml tissue-culture grade PBS, pH7.2 (Gibco, Catalog # 
20012050), and stored under argon gas. Small unilamellar vesicles were formed by 5 
freeze-thaw cycles followed by 2 x 5 min of bath sonication (Bioruptor Pico, Diagenode), 
and cleared by ultracentrifugation (TLA120.1 rotor, 35,000 rpm / 53,227 x g, 35 minutes, 
4C) or by 33 freeze thaw cycles. Lipid mixes were used immediately for form bilayers 
or shock frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored under argon at -80C. To form bilayers on 
silica beads, 6x108 5 µm silica microspheres (10% solids, Bangs Labs, Catalog # 
SS05N) were washed 2x in water, and 2x in PBS by sequential suspension in water and 
spinning at 800 rcf, followed by decanting. Cleaned beads were resuspended in 150 µl 
tissue-culture grade PBS, pH7.2 (Gibco, Catalog # 20012050) and briefly vortexed. 30 
µl cleared SUVs prepared as above as a 10 mM stock were added to bead suspension 
for a 2 mM final SUV concentration. Beads were vortexed for 10 sec, covered in foil, 
and rotated for 30 min at room temperature to form bilayers. Bilayer-coated beads were 
washed 3x in PBS by sequential centrifugation at 800 rcf and decanting. Beads were 
resuspended in PBS + 0.1% w/v BSA for blocking for 15 min rotating at room 
temperature under foil. 10 nM final concentration of CD19his8 (Sino Biological, Catalog # 
11880H08H50) or CD22his8 (Sino Biological, Catalog # 11958H08H50) protein were 
added to blocked beads and proteins were allowed to bind during a 45 min incubation 
rotating under foil at room temperature. Beads were washed 3x in PBS + 0.1% w/v BSA

Preparation of CD19 silica beads over a range of diameters 
Prior building bilayers on Silica beads ranging from 2.5 µm-20 µm in diameter 
(Microspheres-Nanospheres, Catalog# C-SIO-2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20), beads were RCA 
cleaned as follows: beads were pelleted at 2,000xg in low retention tubes (Eppendorf, 
Catalog #022431081) and resuspended in acetone. Resuspended beads were 
sonicated for 60 min in a bath sonicator. Rinse and sonication were repeated in ethanol. 
Finally, rinse and sonication were repeated in water. Beads were then washed 2x in 
water to remove all traces of ethanol and left in a small volume after decanting. All 
further steps were performed in a 70-80oC water bath prepared in a fume hood. Proper 
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) was worn throughout the RCA cleaning protocol. 
Washed beads were added to 3 ml of hot 1.5 M KOH in a clean glass vial suspended in 
the water bath described above. 1 ml 30% H2O2 to bead solution and allowed to react 
for 10 minutes. Washed beads were cooled on ice, pelleted at 2,000xg and rinsed 5x in 
ultrapure water. Used cleaning solution was saved for disposal by Environmental Health 
& Safety (EH&S). Cleaned beads were resuspended in 240 µl tissue-culture grade PBS, 
pH7.2 (Gibco, Catalog # 20012050) and briefly vortexed. The lipid mix used in this 
assay differed slightly from above. Here a mix of 93.5% POPC (Avanti, Catalog # 
850457), 5% Ni2+-DGS-NTA (Avanti, Catalog # 790404), 1% PEG5000-PE (Avanti, 
Catalog # 880230, and 0.5% atto390-DOPE (ATTO-TEC GmbH, Catalog # AD 390-161. 
Bilayers were built and proteins coupled as described above. The concentration of 
CD19 was scaled appropriately to account for the increased surface area of the larger 
beads. 
 
Bead engulfment assay  
12 to 16 hr prior to imaging, 2.5x104 J774A.1 macrophages expressing the appropriate 
CAR-P or control construct were plated in a 96-well glass bottom MatriPlate (Brooks, 
Catalog # MGB096-1-2-LG-L). To assess engulfment, 0.5 x 106 CD19 or CD22-ligated 
beads were added to each well. Engulfment was allowed to proceed for 45 min at 37oC

Bites assay – J774A.1 macrophages, dendritic cells and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts 
On the day of imaging 0.5 x 106 NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, dendritic cells or macrophages and 
1.5 million Raji B cells were combined in a 1.5 ml eppendorf tube and pelleted by 
centrifugation (800 rpm / 68 x g) for 5 min at room temperature. Culture media was 
decanted to ~100 µl volume and cells were gently resuspended, and allowed to interact 
in the small volume for 60 min in a 37oC incubator with CO2. After incubation cells and 
beads were diluted to a final volume of 1000 µl and 300 µl of this co-culture plated for 
imaging in a 96-well glass bottom MatriPlate (Brooks, Catalog # MGB096-1-2-LG-L), 
and imaged as described below. 
 
Eating assay read by FACS – J774A.1 macrophages and Raji B cells 
20,000 J774A.1 macrophages were plated into 96-well glass bottom MatriPlate (Brooks, 
Catalog # MGB096-1-2-LG-L) in a final volume of 300 µl complete DMEM (Gibco, 
Catalog #11965-092) supplemented with 1 x Pen-Strep-Glutamine (Corning, Catalog 
#30-009-Cl) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Atlanta Biologicals, Catalog 
#S11150H). 52 hrs prior to reading the assay macrophages were stimulated with 500 
ng/ml LPS (Sigma, Catalog # L4516). 44 hrs prior to imaging LPS was removed by 
three sequential gentle washes. After LPS removal 10,000 Rajis expressing Caax-
mCherry were added to the well containing stimulated macrophages. The co-culture 
was incubated for 44 hrs in a 37oC tissue culture incubator with 5% CO2. After 44 hrs, 
the remaining number of Raji B cells remaining was analyzed by FACS as follows: 
10,000 counting beads were added to the well immediately prior to reading and the cell-
counting bead mixture was harvested by pipetting up and down 8x with a p200 pipet. 
The assay was read on an LSRII (BD Biosciences) and Rajis were identified by the 
presence of mCherry fluorescence. 
Dendritic cell transduction and differentiation 
To produce CAR-P expressing dendritic cells, bone marrow-derived hematopoietic stem 
cells were lentivirally infected immediately after harvest by spinning with 1:4 
concentrated lentivirus:GMCSF-containing media (IMDM supplemented with 10% FBS

 and PSG) on retronectin (Clontech, Catalog # T100A)-coated plates at 2,200 x g for 45 
min at 37C. Dendritic cells were produced as previously described (Mayordomo et al. 
1995) by culturing bone marrow cells for 8-11 days with GMCSF. IL-4 was added 2-3 
days before use. Efficient differentiation into CD11c+ dendritic cells was verified by 
FACS, revealing ≥95% APC-CD11c+ cells (Biolegend, Catalog #N418).  
 
Antigen cross-presentation assay 
The ability of CAR-P to stimulate OTI T cell proliferation was tested using the co-culture 
assay shown as a schematic in Figure S4A and described previously (Roberts et al. 
2016). 10,000 CAR-P transduced CD11c+ dendritic cells transduced and differentiated 
as above were plated in U bottom 96 well dishes (Falcon, Catalog #353077) and 
stimulated with 1ug/ml LPS. 12 hrs after LPS stimulation, 40,000 Raji B cells expressing 
soluble cytosolic ovalbumin (Raji B-OVA) were added to the culture. 24 hrs after Raji B-
OVA cell addition, 50,000 OTI CD8+ T cells isolated from lymph nodes of OTI TCR 
transgenic mice using a CD8+ T cell purification kit (Stemcell, Catalog #19853) and 
labeled with e670 proliferation dye (Thermo, Catalog #65-0840-85) were added. 72hrs 
after OTI addition the percent of OTI cells divided was measured by eFluor670 signal 
using flow cytometry.  
 
Confocal imaging 
All imaging in this study was performed using a spinning disk confocal microscope with 
environmental control (Nikon Ti-Eclipse inverted microscope with a Yokogawa spinning 
disk unit). For bead internalization assays, images were acquired using a 40x 0.95 N/A 
air objective and unbiased live image acquisition was performed using the High Content 
Screening (HCS) Site Generator plugin in µManager3. Other images were acquired 
using either a 100x 1.49 N/A oil immersion objective. All images were acquired using an 
Andor iXon EM-CCD camera. The open source µManager software package was used 
to control the microscope and acquire all images3. 
 
Quantification of whole cell internalization 
20,000 J774A.1 macrophages were plated into 96-well glass bottom MatriPlate (Brooks,

 Catalog # MGB096-1-2-LG-L). Four hours prior to imaging, the macrophages were 
stimulated with 500 ng/ml LPS (Sigma, Catalog # L4516). Immediately prior to imaging 
the LPS-containing media was replaced with Fluobrite DMEM (ThermoFisher Scientific, 
Catalog # A1896701) containing 10% FBS. 40,000 Raji cells were added to the 
macrophages and the co-culture was imaged at 5 minute intervals for 12 hours. 
Because cells moved in and out of the field of view, we selected the cells present after 8 
hours of imaging and quantified their B cell eating if they could be followed for four 
hours or more. Time-lapse analysis was essential to ensure that the B cell appeared 
viable prior to engulfment by the macrophage. Engulfment of B cells with an apoptotic 
morphology was not counted as a whole cell eating event.  
 
Quantification of bites internalization 
During live cell image acquisition GFP-positive J774A.1 macrophages or NIH 3T3 cells 
were selected by the presence of GFP signal. A full z-stack comprising the entire cell 
was captured using 1 µm steps. All z sections were then manually inspected for 
internalized Raji B cell material. Cells containing one or more bites of fully internalized 
Raji B cell material >1 µm in diameter were scored as positive.    
 
Liposome FRET assay 
Experiments were carried out as previously described2. Briefly, proteins were purified 
using a bacterial expression system. All protein components (1 mg/ml BSA, 100 nM 
tSH2-Syk SNAP-505, 0 to 500 nM His10-CD3ζ or His10-FcRɣ intracellular chain, and 
7.2 nM His10-Lck Y505F) were mixed into kinase buffer (50 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 6.8, 
150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM TCEP). Liposomes prepared at the following 
molar ratios: 74.5 % POPC (Avanti, Catalog # 850457C), 10% DOGS-NTA (Nickel) 
(Avanti, Catalog # 790404C, 0.5% Rhodamine PE (Avanti, Catalog # 810150C), and 
15% DOPS (Avanti, Catalog # 840035C) were added and the mixture was incubated for 
40–60 min at room temperature, during which the SNAP-505 fluorescence was 
monitored at 8 s intervals with 504-nm excitation and 540-nm emission. 1 mM ATP was 
then injected to trigger Lck mediated phosphorylation of CD3ζ or FcRɣ. Injection was 
followed by 5 s of automatic shaking of the plate, and the fluorescence was further

fluorescence value of the last 10 data points before ATP addition as 100% and 
background fluorescence as 0%. The final extent of fluorescence quenching (% 
fluorescence change) at each concentration of receptor was determined using the 
average of the last 20 data points after ensuring fully equilibrated binding. Nine 
reactions containing increasing concentrations of CD3ζ and nine reactions containing 
increasing concentrations of FcRɣ were run in parallel. The final % fluorescence change 
was plotted against FcRɣ or CD3ζ concentration. The apparent dissociation constants 
(Kd) of tSH2-Syk to FcRɣ and CD3ζ were calculated by fitting the data with Graphpad 
Prism 6.0, using the “one site specific binding” model.  
 
Protein expression, purification, and labeling 
The intracellular portion of the FcR γ-chain (aa 45-85, Human FcRɣ, Uniprot 
FCERG_HUMAN) was cloned into a modified pET28a vector containing a His10 
upstream to the multiple cloning site using BamHI and EcoRI. The intracellular portion 
of CD3ζ (aa 52–164, Human CD3ζ, Uniprot CD3Z_HUMAN) was also cloned into the 
His10 modified pET28a vector. A Lys-Cys-Lys-Lys sequence, originally present for 
fluorescent labeling, is also present between His10 and CD3ζ in this construct. SNAP-
tSH2Syk (aa 1-262) was cloned into a pGEX6 vector using BamHI and EcoRI. His10-
CD3ζ, His10-FcR γ-chain, and GST-SNAP-tSH2Syk were bacterially expressed in BL21 
(DE3) RIPL strain of Escherichia coli as described previously2. His10-Lck Y505F was 
expressed in SF9 cells using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus system as described 
previously2. All cells were lysed in an Avestin Emulsiflex system. His10 proteins were 
purified by using Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen, Catalog # 30230) and GST-SNAP-tSH2Syk 
was purified by using glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare, Catalog # 
17075601) as described previously2. Soluble SNAP-tSH2 Syk was generated by 
cleaving the GST moiety via the PreScission Protease at 4°C overnight. All proteins 
were subjected to gel-filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL 
column (GE Healthcare, Catalog # 17517501) in HEPES-buffered saline (HBS) 
containing 50 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 6.8 for His10-CD3ζ, His10-FcR γ-chain, and GST-
SNAP-tSH2Syk and pH 7.4 for His10-Lck Y505F), 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 1 mM

 TCEP. The monomer fractions were pooled, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 
°C. All gel-filtered proteins were quantified by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining, 
using BSA as a standard. To prepare fluorescently labeled tSH2 Syk, 10 uM SNAP-
tSH2 Syk was incubated at a 1:2 ratio with SNAP-Cell 505-Star (NEB, Catalog # 
S9103S) overnight at 4°C and run over a PD MiniTrap G-25 (GE Healthcare, Catalog # 
28-9225-29 AB) column to eliminate excess dye. 
 
Phosphotyrosine Antibody Staining 
To fix and stain preparations described above in bead and bites assays for quantifying 
enrichment of phosphotyrosine staining, half the media (~150 µl) was gently removed 
from the imaging well and replaced with 150 µl 6.4% paraformaldehyde solution 
(prepared from 32% stock, Electron Microscopy Sciences, Catalog # 50980495) in 
tissue culture grade PBS, pH7.2 (Gibco, Catalog # 20012050). Cells were fixed for 15 
minutes in a 37oC incubator with CO2. After fixation cells were washed 2x with PBS and 
permeabilized/blocked for 60 min at room temperature in freshly prepared, filter 
sterilized PBS + 5% FBS + 0.1% w/v saponin (PFS solution). After permeabilization, 
cells were washed 2x 3 min with PFS solution. Following block, cells were incubated 
with 1:100 dilution of mouse anti-phosphotyrosine (pTyr) antibody to stain pan-pTyr 
(Santa Cruz, Catalog # PY20) diluted in PFS solution in the dark for 60 min at room 
temperature then washed 3x 5 min in PFS solution. Washed cells were incubated with a 
1:500 dilution of goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647 antibody (Thermo/Molecular Probes, 
Catalog # A21236) in PFS solution in the dark for 60 min at room temperature. Wells 
were then washed 3x 5 min in PFS solution. Cells were covered in 200 µl PBS. If not 
imaged immediately samples were wrapped in parafilm and foil and stored at 4oC prior 
to microscopy. Phosphotyrosine enrichment at the synapse was calculated by dividing 
the mean Alexa Fluor 647 signal of a 5 pixel linescan at the synapse with bead or cell 
by a 5 pixel linescan on the cortex. Each data point represents a single cell, and the 
graphs reflect pooled results from three biological replicates.

 To fix and stain preparations described above for ovalbumin staining, half the media 
(~150 µl) was gently removed from the imaging well and replaced with 150 µl 8% 
paraformaldehyde solution (prepared from 32% stock, Electron Microscopy Sciences, 
Catalog # 50980495) in tissue culture grade PBS, pH7.2 (Gibco, Catalog # 20012050). 
Cells were fixed for 10 minutes in a 37oC incubator with CO2. After fixation cells were 
washed 2x with PBS and permeabilized/blocked for 60 min at room temperature in 
freshly prepared, filter sterilized PBS + 0.1% w/v casein + 0.1% w/v saponin (PCS 
solution). After permeabilization, cells were washed 1x 3 min with PCS solution and 
blocked for 1hr at room temperature in PCS. Following block, cells were incubated with 
1:100 dilution of rabbit anti-ovalbumin (OVA) antibody to stain OVA (Thermo/Pierce, 
Catalog # PA1-196) diluted in PCS solution overnight at 4oC. Washed cells were 
incubated with a 1:200 dilution of goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 antibody 
(Thermo/Molecular Probes, Catalog # A21235) and 3.3 nM 488 phallodin (dissolved at 
6.6 µM in methanol) in PCS solution in the dark for 60 min at room temperature. Wells 
were then washed 3x 5 min in PCS solution. Cells were covered in 200 µl PBS and 
immediately imaged. Ovalbumin signal was quantified as the corrected total cell 
fluorescence (CTCF). CTCF = Integrated Density – Area of Selected Cell * Mean 
Fluorescence of 3 Background Readings. Each data point represents a single cell, and 
the graphs reflect pooled results from three biological replicates.  
 
Image processing and analysis 
All image quantification was done on raw, unedited images. All images in figures were 
first analyzed in ImageJ, where a single Z-slice at the center of the cell was extracted. 
The image intensities were scaled to enhance contrast and cropped in Photoshop. For 
movies, background was subtracted in Fiji using a rolling ball radius of 50 m and 
bleach corrected using the Histogram Matching plug in.  
 
Statistics 
All statistical analysis was performed in Prism 6.0 (GraphPad, Inc.). The statistical test 
used is indicated in each figure legend. Error bars throughout the paper denote 95%

(A) Schematics show the structure of CAR-P constructs. An ɑCD19 (purple) or ɑCD22 (blue, center) 
scFv directs CAR specificity. Intracellular signaling domains from Megf10 or the indicated engulfment 
receptor (green) activate engulfment. CAR-PGFP contains only GFP and no intracellular signaling 
domains (right). All constructs include a transmembrane domain from CD8 and a C-terminal GFP. (B) 
J774A.1 macrophages expressing ɑCD19 CAR-P with the indicated intracellular signaling domain 
(green) engulf 5 µm silica beads covered with a supported lipid bilayer containing His-tagged CD19 
extracellular domain. The beads were visualized with atto390-labeled lipid incorporated into the sup-
ported lipid bilayer (magenta). Cells infected with the cell membrane marker, mCherry-CAAX, were used 
as a control (no CAR, top left). The average number of beads eaten per cell is quantified in (C). The scale 
bar indicates 5 µm and n=78-163 cells per condition, collected during three separate experiments. Error 
bars denote 95% confidence intervals and *** indicates p<0.0001 compared to mCherry-CAAX control

(A) Macrophages expressing ɑCD19 CAR-PMegf10 (green, top) or ɑCD19 CAR-PGFP were incubated with 
CD19-ligated beads (position indicated with dotted line), fixed and stained for phosphotyrosine 
(magenta, top; greyscale, bottom). The fold enrichment of phosphotyrosine at the cell-bead synapse 
compared to the cell cortex is graphed on the right (n≥11; each dot represents one cell-bead synapse; 
lines represent the mean ± one standard deviation). (B) Schematic shows the structure of CAR-P con-
structs in the plot at right. An αCD19 (purple) scFv directs CAR specificity. The intracellular signaling 
domains from CD3ζ activates engulfment. At right, J774A.1 macrophages expressing the αCD19 with 
the indicated intracellular signaling domain engulf 5 μm silica beads covered with a supported lipid 
bilayer containing His-tagged CD19 extracellular domain. The average number of beads eaten per cell 
is quantified (n=156-167 per condition collected during three separate experiments). Error bars denote 
95% confidence intervals and *** indicates p<0.0001 compared to CAR-PGFP control by Kruskal-Wallis 
test with Dunn’s multiple comparison in correction. (C) Model of the liposome-based fluorescence 
quenching assay used to determine affinity between the Syk tSH2 domains and the receptor tails of 
CD3ζ and FcRγ, two intracellular signaling domains that promote engulfment. Binding between the Syk 
tSH2 reporter (Syk tSH2), green, and a receptor tail, purple, was detected by rhodamine quenching of 
BG505 dye on the reporter (see Methods). Kd was determined by assessing mean fluorescence 
quenching for the last 20 timepoints collected ~45 min after ATP addition over a receptor titration from 
0 to 500 nM. Each point represents the mean ± SD from 3 independent experiments. Kd ± SE was 
calculated by nonlinear fit assuming one site specific binding.

 (A) Schematic of antigen internalization and cross-presentation assay. CAR-P expressing Bone Marrow 
Derived Dendritic Cells (BMDC) were differentiated using GM-CS. CAR-P BMDC were incubated with 
Raji B cells expressing soluble ovalbumin (OVA). DC with OVA bites (internalized antigen) were then 
incubated with OTI T cells (OVA specific CD8+ T cells) and OTI proliferation assessed as a measure 
of T cell stimulation. Results from each step of this assay are shown in sequence in (B), (C), and (D). 
(B) Ovalbumin staining (magenta) in Raji B cells infected with Caax-mCherry-p2a-Ovalbumin lentivirus 
(OVA) and uninfected controls (uninfected) shows robust OVA expression in infected cells. At right the 
intracellular OVA signal is plotted as corrected total cell fluorescence (CTCF) for the ovalbumin channel. 
Each dot represents the CTCF of one cell; n=26 cells OVA, n=33 cells (uninfected); lines represent the 
mean ± one standard deviation, and the graph is the pooled results of three biological replicates. The 
scale bar indicates 5 µm. (C) Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells expressing the CAR-PFcRɣ (top panel, 
green in merge, left; greyscale, center) engulf pieces of CD19+ Raji B cells (labeled with mCherry-
CAAX; magenta in merge, left; greyscale, right). The control ɑCD19 CAR-PGFP-infected dendritic cells 
are shown below. Arrows point to pieces of ingested Raji B cell. The proportion of cells taking at least 
one bite after 90 min co-incubation is graphed on the right of images. Graphs show the pooled data of 
two separate experiments; n=28 CAR-PFcRɣ dendritic cells and n=33 CAR-PGFP dendritic cells; *** 
indicates p<0.0001 by two-tailed Fisher Exact Test; error bars denote 95% confidence intervals. Bites 
are defined as a fully internalized piece of mCherry-labeled material >1 µm in diameter. (D) OTI T cell 
proliferation after 72hr incubation with CAR-P transduced CD11c+ dendritic cells. +/- RAJI below the 
x-axis indicates whether Raji-OVA B cells were added to CAR-P transduced dendritic cells prior to OTI 
addition. To measure proliferation, T cells were uniformly stained with eFluor670 dye on day 0, and 
proliferation was measured by dilution of the cell-bound dye. Graphs show the mean ± SD of three 
independent biological replicates. Data points are values for individual wells of differentiated CD11c+ 
dendritic cells. Boxed data indicate the mean % T cells dividing when dendritic cells were pulsed with 
SL8 (OVA) peptide, which directly binds to MHC without undergoing cross presentation. If dendritic cell 
differentiation was successful, the pulsed dendritic cells should be capable of inducing robust OTI 
proliferation. Sample sizes were selected to match previous studies that were able to detect robust T 
cell stimulation (Roberts et al. 2016).
