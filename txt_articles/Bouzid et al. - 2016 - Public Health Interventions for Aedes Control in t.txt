Abstract
Background
There is renewed interest in effective measures to control Zika and dengue vectors. A syn-
thesis of published literature with a focus on the quality of evidence is warranted to deter-
mine the effectiveness of vector control strategies.
Methodology
We conducted a meta-review assessing the effectiveness of any Aedes control measure.
We searched Scopus and Medline for relevant reviews through to May 2016. Titles,
abstracts and full texts were assessed independently for inclusion by two authors. Data
extraction was performed in duplicate and validity of the evidence was assessed using
GRADE criteria.
Findings
13 systematic reviews that investigated the effect of control measures on entomological
parameters or disease incidence were included. Biological controls seem to achieve better
reduction of entomological indices than chemical controls, while educational campaigns can
reduce breeding habitats. Integrated vector control strategies may not always increase
effectiveness. The efficacy of any control programme is dependent on local settings, inter-
vention type, resources and study duration, which may partly explain the varying degree of
success between studies. Nevertheless, the quality of evidence was mostly low to very low
due to poor reporting of study design, observational methodologies, heterogeneity, and indi-
rect outcomes, thus hindering an evidence-based recommendation.
Conclusions
The evidence for the effectiveness of Aedes control measures is mixed. Chemical control,
which is commonly used, does not appear to be associated with sustainable reductions of
mosquito populations over time. Indeed, by contributing to a false sense of security, chemi-
cal control may reduce the effectiveness of educational interventions aimed at encouraging
local people to remove mosquito breeding sites. Better quality studies of the impact of vector

Author Summary
Various strategies for the control of mosquito-borne diseases exist and have been used for
decades. The effectiveness of these control measures has been evaluated in several system-
atic reviews, however, their conclusions were contradicting. The current Zika outbreak in
the Americas renewed the global health community’s interest in the control of Aedes
transmitted diseases (dengue, yellow fever and chikungunya). We sought to provide an up
to date systematic review about the effectiveness of chemical, biological, educational and
integrated vector control strategies. In addition, we looked at recent primary studies that
were not included in any systematic review as well as novel tools for mosquito control.
This meta-review provides a comprehensive list of systematic reviews on the effect of vec-
tor control interventions on entomological parameters (most often indicators of vector
density) or disease incidence. Biological control was found to achieve higher reduction of
mosquito populations than chemical control. Educational campaigns are essential to
reduce breeding sites and interrupt disease transmission. Integrated vector control strate-
gies may not always increase effectiveness. The quality of the evidence was low to very low
for most interventions. The effectiveness of any control strategy is setting- dependent.
Introduction
The ongoing Zika virus outbreak in Central and South America which started in 2014 has
attracted media attention and alarmed public health officials worldwide because of the high
number of people affected, rapid transmission rate and association with immuno-neurological
disorders (eg. Guillain-Barre
´ syndrome) and newborn microcephaly [1–3]. It is feared that
Zika virus will spread rapidly in the Americas as was the case for dengue and Chikungunya [2,
4]. Dengue fever, Zika, Chikungunya and yellow fever viruses are all transmitted by Aedes
aegypti mosquitoes and associated with significant disease burden globally. While yellow fever
is the only disease that has an effective vaccine, its incidence is increasing and it was stated that
yellow fever is making a comeback due to the increasing number of naïve population following
the scaling back of mass vaccination and changing sociodemographic conditions [5, 6]. Aedes
is a genus of mosquitos which originated in Africa but are now found worldwide in tropical
and subtropical zones. Establishment of Aedes mosquito, especially A. aegypti, has resulted in
the epidemic spread of several arboviruses and linked to the current epidemic outbreak of Zika
virus in South America [7]. The success of A. aegypti is linked to its opportunistic and high
adaptability to the peridomestic environment exploiting any stagnant water as its breeding
habitat [8]. Despite decades of Aedes mosquito control programmes, mosquito populations are
widely established and abundant worldwide. Recognition of the link between Zika virus and
newborn microcephaly in Brazil led to a concerted and renewed interest in Aedes control [7].
The World Health Organisation advice to control Aedes transmitted diseases is well imple-
mented mosquito control measures that can effectively reduce disease transmission [8]. In
order to assist the active implementation of Aedes control measures, we sought to provide a
timely, up to date and evidence based synthesis of the literature.

Competing Interests: The authors have declared

 We carried out a meta-review or “systematic review of systematic reviews” [9, 10], to assess
and synthesise evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Meta-reviews allow evi-
dence to be summarised on topics for which multiple systematic reviews have already been
published [9, 11]. In addition, it may be possible to identify patterns of results not previously
apparent, by taking into account a larger body of evidence than any individual systematic
review captured. Meta-reviews provide a structured approach for exploring and explaining dif-
ferences in systematic review conclusions, which may have resulted from variations in objec-
tives, quality or other factors. This meta-review critically assessed systematic reviews that
investigated the effectiveness of Aedes control interventions or protective measures against
Aedes transmitted diseases.
Methods
Search methodology and inclusion criteria
In a previous meta-review investigating control strategies for a number of climate sensitive dis-
eases, a broad search strategy retrieved five systematic reviews about dengue control [12]. For
the current meta-review, the search was updated to retrieve recent systematic reviews on con-
trol of Aedes transmitted diseases (published between January 2011 and May 2016). Scopus
and Medline Ovid databases were searched using the following search strategy: “(dengue OR
chikungunya OR yellow fever OR Zika OR Aedes) AND (systematic review OR meta-analy-
sis)”. This format was restricted to title, abstract and keyword fields. All systematic reviews
reporting on the effectiveness of Aedes control measures were included. Reference lists from
included reviews were screened for additional relevant reviews.
Titles, abstracts and full texts were assessed independently for inclusion by two authors.
Data extraction was performed independently in duplicate using a standardised form and dif-
ferences were resolved by discussion. Data extracted included type of intervention, main out-
come measure, number of included studies, type of control group (pre-post, contemporary)
and pooled effect size (when reported). The methodology and reporting were in accordance
with the “Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses” (PRISMA)
[13] (S1 Checklist). The general approach adopted in this meta-review was based on the 2nd
edition of the World Health Organization’s Handbook for Guideline Development especially
chapters 8 and 9 [14].
Categorisation of vector control strategies
Vector control strategies were categorised as 1) Chemical controls (including insecticide and
larvicide applications), 2) Biological controls (where a biological agent was used), 3) Educa-
tional campaigns (focused on training and awareness of the general public with the aim of
reduction/ elimination of breeding sites) or 4) Integrated vector controls (comprising two or
more individual control strategies) also known as Integrated Vector Management.
Assessment of the quality of evidence using GRADE
The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE score, recommended by the World
Health Organisation [14], (http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/) based on five criteria namely:
risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness of evidence and publication bias [15].
Scores for each of these criteria were calculated and then combined for each intervention and
by outcome measure. The overall score allowed to judge the quality of the evidence as very
good, good, poor or very poor (for details of scoring see S1 Table).

 Results
165 articles published in 2011–2016 were retrieved from Scopus, 103 from Medline Ovid, with
a total combined reduced to 177 after removal of duplicates. Following title and abstract
screening, the full texts of 10 reviews were obtained and screened. Scanning of reference lists
suggested one additional eligible systematic review. After full text analysis, three reviews were
excluded. Five eligible systematic reviews from a previous meta-review [12] on control of cli-
mate-sensitive diseases were also included, leading to a final total of 13 included systematic
reviews for data extraction and synthesis. The selection process is shown in Fig 1. The majority
of systematic reviews dealt with dengue control. Many primary studies were included in multi-
ple reviews.
Overview of control measures in included systematic reviews
Control strategies were classified as chemical, biological, educational or integrated. For each
included systematic review, control strategy, main outcome measure(s), number of included
studies and effectiveness were recorded for each intervention type. Effectiveness was usually
reported as pooled effect size for entomological indices or clinical outcomes. When pooled
effects were not reported, descriptive analyses described by the authors were extracted instead.
Table 1 summarises the characteristics of the included reviews.
Reviews reporting on effectiveness of chemical control were most common (8/13), with 17
study arms (per type of intervention and outcome measure). All eight reviews [16–23]
reported on the effects of chemical control on entomological indices and 4/8 [16–18, 22] on
dengue incidence. Chemical control included insecticide spraying, insecticide treated curtains,
nets and screens, and larvicide application (particularly temephos). Biological control was
assessed in six reviews (8 study arms) and included copepods (crustaceans in water storage
that eat mosquito larvae), larvivorous fish, Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) bacterium,
predatory insects and turtles. Copepods (n = 5) and Bti (n = 4) were the most widely reviewed
biological agents. A single biological strategy was assessed in three reviews (5 study arms) and
a combination of biological control strategies was assessed in three systematic reviews (3 study
arms). For biological control, all six reviews [19, 20, 23–26] reported on entomological indices
and two reviews [24, 26] also reported on dengue cases.
Four reviews (5 study arms) reported on educational campaigns (involving training, aware-
ness raising and cleanliness incentives in households and/or for school children) as the only
disease control measure. Educational campaigns aimed to reduce breeding sites by removing
or covering water containers and elimination of water collection micro-habitats in the perido-
mestic environment. All four reviews [16, 17, 20, 27] reported on entomological indices and
one [16] on dengue incidence. Integrated vector control strategies (details in Table 1) were
assessed in 9/13 systematic reviews (16 study arms). Entomological indices were reported on
in all nine reviews [16, 18–21, 23, 25, 27, 28] while only two reviews [25, 27] reported on den-
gue cases.
Effectiveness of Chemical vector control
Insecticide spraying (adulticiding).
The most recent systematic review for dengue con-
trol was by Bowman and colleagues, who considered dengue incidence as their primary out-
come measure [16]. Therefore, despite considering 19 primary studies, only a few studies were
included for each intervention type. For insecticide spraying, only one observational study was
included, which suggested a statistically significant negative effect (lower dengue incidence
where spraying had not occurred), while for indoor insecticide spraying, two observational
studies were included and the pooled Odds Ratio (OR) of 0.67 (95% CI 0.22–2.11) did not

quality.
Das and colleagues included 17 primary studies (4 RCTs (randomised controlled trials) and
13 pre-post studies) [17]. Meta-analysis of nine pre-post studies of insecticide spraying and

 aerosols suggested a statistically significant 10% reduction in House Index (percentage of
houses infested with larvae and/or pupae) (relative risk (RR) 0.90, 95% CI: 0.86–0.95), though
effect on Breteau Index (number of containers with Aedes spp. larvae per 100 houses) in 2
RCTs was not statistically significant (both very low quality evidence). Ballenger-Browning
and colleagues [20] reported an average 27% reduction in entomological indices after chemical
control (insecticide, larvicides, ovitraps) in 3 RCTs and 3 clustered RCTs, but no meta-analysis
was carried out and results were inconsistent between studies. Conversely, Erlanger and col-
leagues reported 76% reduction in Breteau Index (BI) after outdoor insecticide spraying based
on five studies (Relative effectiveness 0.24 (95% CI 0.05–1.19), though this was not statistically
significant [19]. Both systematic reviews provided very low quality evidence.
The review by Esu and colleagues focussed on effectiveness of peridomestic insecticide
spraying, assessing entomological indices and dengue incidence [18]. They included 15 studies
(including one pre-post study reporting on dengue incidence). Many studies were considered
of poor quality and few took account of possible confounders, which is in accordance with our
GRADE score suggesting very low quality evidence. No meta-analysis was reported because of
the poor comparability of studies. The authors concluded that the evidence for the effective-
ness of peridomestic space spraying was weak as reduction in entomological indices was not
sustained over long periods of time [18].
Larviciding.
George and colleagues reviewed efficacy of temephos in water storage con-
tainers (n = 11 studies) [21]. Four studies had pre-post design and seven had contemporary
control groups. When temephos was used as an isolated intervention, all 11 studies reported a
post-intervention reduction in the immature stages compared to their respective control
group. It was observed that the treated sources were free of larvae for a variable period of time
depending on the season of application, number of applications, dosage of temephos, proce-
dure of control, and method of application. The authors did not pool results and concluded
that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that temephos reduces dengue transmission.
As study validity, publication bias and health outcomes were not reported, quality of evidence
was very low.
Insecticide treated nets, curtains and screens. Bowman and colleagues assessed the effect
of insecticide treated curtains on entomological indices based on 2 RCTs [16]. Statistically sig-
nificant effects were not found for any of the four entomological indices assessed (for example,
mean difference for Breteau Index was -25.16 (95% CI -76.03 to 25.71) with I2 97% and for
House index -10.58 (95% CI -32.22 to 11.05) I2 97%)). Due to problems with allocation con-
cealment, blinding and inconsistency, the quality of the evidence was very low. The same
review evaluated the effect of home screens and bed nets on dengue incidence, though it was
unclear whether these were insecticide treated [16]. For home screens, the pooled OR for den-
gue incidence was 0.22 (95% CI 0.05–0.93) based on 3 studies, but the evidence was of very
low quality due to problems with confounding and selection bias in these observational stud-
ies. For bed nets a pooled OR of 0.91 was reported, though not statistically significant, which
was very low quality evidence based on GRADE score.
Das and colleagues pooled data from four studies that assessed efficacy of domestic insecti-
cide treated nets or curtains, and found a 70% reduction in dengue positive serotype status
(RR: 0.30, 95%CI 0.23–0.38) [17]. Two studies were RCTs and two had a pre-post design. Due
to lack of appropriate sequence generation and unclear blinding of assessors, the evidence was
of low quality, despite the large effect size.
Wilson and colleagues reviewed the effect of insecticide treated nets (1 study), curtains (3
studies) and screens (1 study) on entomological indices and of insecticide treated screens on
dengue seroconversion [22]. Four studies had contemporary control groups (RCTs) and one
was pre-post design. Reductions in entomological indicators were reported in some individual

 studies, but no pooled effect size was calculated and results were inconsistent. The pre-post
study reported 80% protective efficacy of insecticide treated house screens (95% CI 53 to 92%)
against IgM seropositivity. The quality of evidence was low for both entomological outcomes
and dengue seropositivity. Wilson and colleagues concluded that insecticide treated materials
could reduce disease transmission, but reported that low A. aegypti mortality rates indicated
significant insecticide resistance, which is likely to dramatically decrease the effectiveness of
this type of control measure [22]. The authors highlighted that the study investigating dengue
seropositivity used a non-randomised pre-post design and was deemed of low quality.
Lima and colleagues reviewed the effect of chemical control (insecticide spraying, growth
regulators, insecticide treated items) based on 5 studies with contemporary control groups
[23]. The pooled significance statistics (pw), which appear to equate to a standardised mean
difference, suggested statistical significance. The quality of evidence was very low as methodol-
ogy, validity and consistency of the included studies were not described.
Effectiveness of biological control
Copepods.
Lazaro and colleagues [24] reviewed the effectiveness of copepods introduced
into water storage containers. All eleven studies were non-randomised interventions with con-
temporary comparator groups, providing very low quality evidence on entomological indica-
tors (assessed in all studies) and low quality evidence on dengue seropositivity (assessed in
three studies). No pooled effect size was calculated and results were presented descriptively.
Copepods (Mesocyclops spp.) were effective for vector control in five community studies in
Vietnam, including long-term control of larval and adult A. aegypti and dengue incidence
[24]. However, this success was not replicated in studies conducted elsewhere. The authors
attributed the Vietnam success to community participation, environmental and/or biological
factors.
Larvivorous fish.
Han and colleagues assessed the effect of larvivorous fish (single or mul-
tiple species) in water storage containers based on ten studies [25]. Two studies were pre-post
comparisons and eight studies had contemporary comparators (though were not randomised),
providing very low quality evidence. Results were presented descriptively and without quanti-
tative pooling. Elimination of Aedes larvae was achieved in three studies. 9/10 studies reported
a reduction in immature forms of dengue vector, two of which reported a continuous decline
over 2 years. Reduction of adult mosquitoes was shown in only two studies.
Bacillus thuringiensisisraelensis(Bti).
In Boyce and colleagues Bacillus thuringiensis
israelensis (Bti), a bacterium that produces toxic proteins leading to high mortality among lar-
vae after ingestion, was used as a dengue control measure [26]. 14 studies with contemporary
control groups (4 RCTs, 10 clustered RCTs) reporting on entomological indices were included.
12 studies reported reductions in entomological indices, providing very low quality evidence.
The authors reported that the two studies that did not show entomological reductions used
environmental management or educational campaign in their control groups. Only one RCT
reported on the effect of Bti as a targeted treatment of mosquito breeding sites on dengue
cases. The treated area had one dengue case while 15 cases were recorded in the untreated
area, however, this was considered very low quality evidence using the GRADE score. Given
the large number of potential habitats and the impracticality of targeting them all, the authors
concluded that the use of Bti as a single control measure may not achieve significant reduc-
tions in entomological indices and control dengue and other Aedes transmitted diseases [26].
Mixed biological interventions.
Lima and colleagues considered a range of biological
control measures (larvivorous fish, copepods, Bti and predatory insects) based on five studies,
all with contemporary control groups [23]. The pooled significance statistic (pw), suggested

 statistical significance, but provided very low quality evidence. Ballenger-Browning and Elder
also assessed several biological control measures (copepods, Bti and turtles) based on five stud-
ies that had contemporary control groups [20]. They reported 96.3% reduction in entomologi-
cal indices (range 75.1–100%) based on Mulla’s formula, with a large effect size, though the
evidence was of low quality. Erlanger and colleagues assessed a range of biological controls
including larvivorous fish, predatory insect larvae and copepods [19]. The review was based on
ten studies, nine of which were included in a pooled analysis, suggesting 82% reduction of con-
tainer index (percentage of water containers positive for larvae/ pupae) (relative effectiveness
0.18, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.44), providing very low quality evidence of effectiveness, partly due to
clear heterogeneity in study results. The one excluded study showed increased dengue risk in
the intervention arm.
Effectiveness of educational campaigns
Educational campaigns and community action interventions focus on educating and encour-
aging community members to take steps to reduce disease risk through environmental modifi-
cation in order to reduce or eliminate mosquito’s breeding sites. While educational campaigns
are rarely used as the sole control measure, four reviews assessed the effect of this control strat-
egy on dengue transmission.
Bowman and colleagues included one RCT which assessed the effectiveness of community
based environmental modification (including clean up, education, mobilisation and use of
water container covers) on dengue incidence, finding a statistically significant reduction in
dengue (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.32), but providing only low quality evidence due to unclear
allocation concealment, lack of blinding and lack of reproducibility. Evidence on entomologi-
cal indices came from two studies, which appeared to lead to reductions in Breteau, House and
Container Indices, however, the evidence was of low quality [16].
Das and colleagues assessed the effectiveness of preventive community based education and
cleanliness campaigns based on three pre- post studies [17]. 25% reduction in ovitrap index
(eggs found in traps per 100 houses) (RR 0.75, 95%CI 0.62–0.91) was reported, however, the
quality of the evidence was very low. Ballenger-Browning and colleagues assessed the effect of
educational or behavioural interventions (screening, cleaning or disposal of water containers)
based on five studies with contemporary control groups [20]. They reported 41.6% mean
reduction of entomological indices (range 4–87.6%), but this was very low quality evidence.
Heintze and colleagues focussed on community-based control programmes (educational
meetings and materials) based on five studies [27]. No pooled effect size was calculated as the
authors found that most primary studies (all showing reductions in entomological indices)
were of low quality, which was in accordance with the GRADE score.
Effectiveness of integrated vector control measures
Integrated vector management refers to the simultaneous use of two or more control measures
as detailed above. This type of control is favoured because it is thought to be more effective,
which is reflected in the number of relevant systematic reviews (9/13).
George and colleagues reviewed the efficacy of temephos larvicide in water storage contain-
ers with other control measures (chemical or biological vector control, education campaigns)
based on 16 studies [21]. Nine studies were pre-post design and seven were interventions with
contemporary control groups (including 3 RCTs), providing very low quality evidence. No
pooled effect size was calculated. Although 11 / 16 studies showed that temephos application
together with other chemical vector control methods reduced entomological indices, this ben-
efit was either not sustained over time or failed to reduce the immature stages (in 5 studies).

 The effectiveness of temephos depended on various factors including quality of delivery, water
turnover rate, water type, organic debris, temperature and exposure to sunlight. In addition,
long term success depended on political commitment and community participation. Limita-
tions to temephos use and community effectiveness were identified as need for reapplication,
cost, supplies, time consuming and laborious nature, high water turnover and temephos resis-
tance as well as poor acceptability (due to unpleasant odour and taste) and limited local knowl-
edge. Furthermore, it was reported that the use of temephos as part of an integrated strategy
seemed to reduce implementation rate and effectiveness of source reduction and environmen-
tal management because of a false sense of security due to the belief that temephos application
alone is sufficient to prevent dengue [21].
Han and colleagues assessed the effect of larvivorous fish in combination with other biolog-
ical control measures and educational campaigns based on three studies (2 pre-post and 1 con-
temporary control group) [25]. All studies reported reductions in entomological indices
though no pooled effect was calculated. The quality of evidence was very low. The same review
assessed the effect of larvivorous fish alone or as part of integrated control on dengue cases
based on two studies, providing very low quality evidence [25]. The first study found no den-
gue cases in any village since the start of the intervention, and the other study reported a
decline from 6 cases pre-intervention to zero cases post-intervention, but the authors stated
that this could not be attributed solely to the intervention.
Lima and colleagues investigated the effectiveness of integrated vector control combining
biological, chemical and educational strategies based on 12 studies all with contemporary con-
trol groups [23]. The pooled significance statistic (pw) suggested statistical significance, but
provided very low quality evidence.
Al-Muhandis and Hunter focussed on the role of community based educational interven-
tions either alone or in combination with chemical or biological control (including indoor and
outdoor insecticide spraying, larviciding, copepods, covering, removal and clean-up of water
containers) [28]. This review included 22 studies (6 pre-post and 16 contemporary control
groups), and reported a pooled relative effectiveness of 0.25 (95%CI 0.17–0.37) for entomolog-
ical indices, with very low quality evidence. The authors reported that 61% of the heterogeneity
in outcome measures could be explained by the type of control group and time from interven-
tion to assessment. Studies using pre-post design substantially overestimated intervention
effectiveness compared to studies using contemporary controls. It was noted that the effective-
ness of educational interventions was maintained for about 18 months, and the authors
observed that adding chemical or biological control to educational campaigns did not add
value or increase effectiveness [28]. This finding was also reported by Esu and colleagues [18]
who stated that houses that received both educational and chemical control did not achieve
significant reduction of entomological indices, while houses that received educational cam-
paigns alone achieved significant reduction. The authors concluded that chemical spraying
may create a false sense of security and thus reduce the beneficial effect of educational
campaigns.
Erlanger and colleagues assessed three types of integrated vector control strategies [19]. The
first category focused on environmental management (removal of unused and covering of
water containers) in combination with insecticide treated nets, curtains and screens and
included 14 studies. The authors conducted pooled analyses, finding statistically significant
reductions in three entomological indices, and providing very low quality evidence: Breteau
Index (pooled BI, 0.71, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.90) based on 9 studies, Container Index (pooled CI,
0.43, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.59) and House Index (pooled HI, 0.49, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.79) (both based
on 10 studies each). The second integrated control category was environmental management
in combination with outdoor and indoor spraying as well as bed nets and larviciding. The
Aedes Control in the Time of Zika

 pooled effect sizes suggested improvements in Breteau and House Indices, but not Container
Index, though the evidence was of very low quality: (BI 0.33, 95%CI 0.22 to 0.48 based on 11
studies, CI 0.17, 95%CI 0.02 to 1.28 based on 9 studies and HI 0.12 95%CI 0.02 to 0.62 based
on 8 studies). The third category was environmental management in combination with biolog-
ical control, for which 5 primary studies were retrieved but no pooled effect was calculated as
the studies reported on distinct entomological indices, providing very low quality evidence.
Due to the consistent evidence of improvements in entomological indices, Erlanger and col-
leagues concluded that dengue vector control is effective in reducing vector populations [19].
However, their conclusion was not supported by the quality of evidence. The review did not
report study methodology or assess study validity, study results were clearly heterogeneous,
publication bias was unclear and no health outcomes were reported. The authors investigated
intervention type as a source of heterogeneity and did not attempt to investigate whether
excluding studies from pooling would bias their conclusions.
Heintze and colleagues focussed on community-based educational control programmes in
combination with chemical larvicide and larvivorous fish or copepods based on 11 studies (2
RCTs, 6 pre-post studies and 3 interrupted time series) [27]. Each category was assessed sepa-
rately and by outcome measure i.e. entomological indices and dengue incidence resulting in a
very small number of primary studies per category. The authors reported that most studies
were of low quality and concluded that the evidence of the effectiveness of community-based
dengue control programmes is weak, which concurs with our GRADE score showing very low
quality evidence for these interventions.
Effectiveness of other control strategies
In addition to the widely used control strategies discussed above, Bowman and colleagues
reviewed the effect of insect repellents (1 study), mosquito coils (2 studies) and mosquito traps
(1 study) on dengue incidence [16]. The use of insect repellents and mosquito traps were not
associated with a protective effect, while mosquito coils were significantly associated with an
increased risk of dengue incidence (OR 1.44; 95% CI 1.09–1.91; p = 0.01). The quality of the
evidence was very low.
Discussion
Most included systematic reviews focussed on reducing entomological indicators. Undeniably,
vector presence is pivotal for disease transmission, yet, there is no clear evidence of quantifi-
able association between vector density and disease transmission in particular whether reduc-
ing vector abundance actually leads to less disease [29]. This shortcoming was noticed by only
a few systematic reviews’ authors. For example Heintze and colleagues stated “our findings
suggest that although community-based control strategies in addition to or together with bio-
logical and chemical vector control tools are able to reduce classical Aedes larval indices, it is
unknown whether this reduces dengue transmission” [27]. Therefore, evidence about entomo-
logical indices only was downgraded in our quality assessment for intervention impacts on dis-
ease incidence. Indeed, out of eight reviews that assessed the effect of vector control on disease
outcomes [16–18, 22, 24–27], only two showed pooled statistically significant reduction in
dengue incidence or positive serology [16, 17]. Future research on the effect of vector control
strategies should utilise RCT methodology, have longer durations and report disease-related
outcomes.
The strength of evidence for the effectiveness of any vector control intervention was uni-
formly low or very low. This means that while, in many cases, there was a suggestion of
improvement, this was not scientifically rigorous, and we have little ability to compare

 effectiveness (or cost effectiveness) of different strategies. This was due to several reasons.
Where dengue incidence was directly assessed, primary studies were generally observational,
and intervention studies mostly assessed entomological outcomes (both observational studies
and indirect outcomes downgraded the strength of evidence). The risk of bias in included
studies was generally scored as very high due to problems with allocation concealment and
blinding in intervention studies and lack of quality assessment or problems with confounding
and dissimilarity of comparator groups at baseline for observational studies. In order to truly
understand the effectiveness of dengue (and other vector-borne diseases) control interven-
tions, we need high quality randomised controlled trials with adequate blinding, allocation
concealment and sample size reporting on disease outcomes for long enough follow-up
period.
Our review of the evidence was hampered by the quality of primary studies as well as some
of the systematic reviews included. It was uncommon for systematic reviews to describe study
methodology accurately or assess study validity appropriately or publication bias. These omis-
sions have inevitably clouded our understanding of the levels of bias within the included pri-
mary studies [30]. It is possible that some evidence maybe of higher quality than assessed
using the GRADE score, but in the absence of clear reporting, the quality of the evidence is
downgraded.
Where reviews did not assess the underlying validity of the included studies, particularly
study methodology (type of control group, randomisation, allocation concealment and blind-
ing), the effectiveness of vector control strategies was more likely to be over-stated. Previous
research established that using historical controls (pre-post studies) substantially over-esti-
mated effectiveness compared to studies using contemporary control groups [28]. The use of
historic controls is considered poor practice as most historical control groups are compro-
mised [31, 32]. Many studies in the review by Erlanger and colleagues [19] had pre-post
design, which may explain their conclusions that “dengue vector control is effective in reduc-
ing vector populations”, even though our assessment suggests very low quality evidence. How-
ever, other reviews surveying some of the same evidence were more cautious, such as Heintze
and colleagues [27] who concluded “Evidence that community-based dengue control pro-
grammes . . . can enhance the effectiveness of dengue control programmes is weak”, Ballenger-
Browning and Elder said “Little evidence exists to support the efficacy of mosquito abatement
programs owing to poor study designs and lack of congruent entomologic indices” [20] and
Esu and colleagues stated “Based on a comprehensive search of available peer reviewed litera-
ture, the effectiveness of peridomestic space spraying in reducing dengue transmission has not
been conclusively demonstrated” [18].
While systematic reviews represent high quality evidence, we acknowledge that they might
exclude relevant studies due to strict inclusion criteria and are limited to dated evidence i.e. by
the time of publication, the recent literature could comprise relevant studies (potentially
changing the body of evidence). Therefore, we attempted to provide a brief overview of latest
relevant research that did not inform this meta-review, including novel vector control strate-
gies that did not have ample body of evidence warranting consideration by systematic reviews’
authors. Further information is provided in S1 Text.
It is worth bearing in mind that effectiveness of any disease control intervention is closely
related to the specific settings of the study area. For example, Lazaro and colleagues found that
copepods were effective in studies carried out in Vietnam, including long-term control of lar-
val and adult A. aegypti and dengue incidence [24]. However, this success was not replicated in
studies conducted elsewhere (Costa Rica, Mexico, USA, Honduras, Laos). The authors attrib-
uted the success in Vietnam to community participation, environmental and/or biological fac-
tors. Tran and colleagues discussed social sustainability of copepods for dengue control in
Aedes Control in the Time of Zika

 Vietnam, and reported that effectiveness varied between northern and central Vietnam (high
sustainability) and south Vietnam (low sustainability) [33]. Limited knowledge and education,
lack of government support, poor implementation and poor household monitoring were the
main drivers of low sustainability and limited effectiveness [33]. Further investigations includ-
ing qualitative research alongside RCTs may assist better understanding of crucial factors sup-
porting or reducing the effectiveness of specific control interventions.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends “integrated approaches that tackle
all life stages of the mosquito and fully engage communities” for the control of Zika and other
Aedes transmitted diseases [8]. This is in accordance with Heintze and colleagues that “multi-
faceted interventions are more effective than single interventions because a larger variety of
barriers for change can be addressed” [27], which is also in line with social science theory [34].
However, two reviews found that adding additional chemical or biological interventions to
educational campaigns did not increase efficacy [18, 28]. This was attributed to a false sense of
security following insecticide spraying [18] and the belief that temephos alone is sufficient to
control dengue transmission [21]. Therefore, our review suggests that the WHO is correct to
reiterate that the most effective intervention to control disease and protect populations is the
elimination of mosquito breeding sites [8], which would require sustained and ongoing educa-
tion campaigns, resource allocation and good governance. This is particularly important con-
sidering the resilience of A. aegypti mosquitoes, with population numbers recovering and
increasing shortly after vector control strategies have ceased [12]. While prevention of mos-
quito borne diseases has always focused on control of the mosquito vector, there is a debate
about whether a rethink of control strategies is warranted. This is relevant considering the day
biting pattern and low flight range (<100 m) of Aedes mosquitoes. These traits mean that vec-
tor control strategies should be focused not only on the peridomestic environment but also on
day gathering places such as markets, schools, hospitals etc. and combined with better diagno-
sis and monitoring/ restriction of viremic persons’ movement, which has been found to be an
important driver of dengue spatiotemporal clustering and disease spread [35]. In addition, rel-
evant factors driving establishment of Aedes and spread of Aedes transmitted diseases need to
be better understood and accounted for when designing control strategies such as interna-
tional travel and trade, urbanisation, water storage practices, socioeconomic factors and global
environmental change.
All the primary studies included in the systematic reviews were undertaken in low and mid-
dle income countries (LMICs). Caveats may need to apply if extrapolating public health
research between LMICs and indeed to high income nations. The efficacy of any newly intro-
duced vector control measure may depend on other control measures already in place [36].
Another knowledge gap identified here is the scarcity of data on cost effectiveness of vector
control strategies in systematic reviews [27]. Bearing in mind that Health Economics is cur-
rently a major element in decision making processes, future studies should address this gap
[37, 38]. This is particularly important considering the significant burden of dengue and other
vector-borne diseases (including Zika and yellow fever) and the international commitment to
improve global health and eradicate poverty related diseases with finite financial means.
Conclusions
We identified thirteen systematic reviews assessing dengue or Aedes control strategies. Control
strategies were categorised and the effect of interventions on entomological indices and disease
incidence were recorded. Though some systematic reviews reported significant reduction of
entomological indices, most reviews were considered to be of low to very low quality. This sug-
gests that more high quality primary studies and well conducted systematic reviews that follow

 PRISMA reporting guidance and report on the quality of evidence [13] are still required for
evidence based recommendations. The systematic reviews we assessed suggest that biological
control achieves better and more sustainable reduction of entomological indices than chemical
control. Educational campaigns and community engagement appear paramount in reducing
breeding habitats in the peridomestic environment, although ongoing resources must be allo-
cated to ensure educational interventions are maintained. Chemical control measures could be
associated with a false sense of security leading to lesser community engagement with reduc-
tion/ elimination of breeding sites. Promising novel vector control strategies are being tested
and would be a valuable addition to control mosquito borne diseases.
