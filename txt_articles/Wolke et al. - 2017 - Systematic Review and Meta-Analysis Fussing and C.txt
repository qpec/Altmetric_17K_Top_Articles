Abstract  
Objective: To determine the mean duration of fussing and crying and prevalence of 
colic using modified Wessel criteria in infants in the first 3 months of life. Is there a 
universal 6 week crying peak and what is the prevalence of colic according to age and 
country?  
Study Design: A systematic literature search was performed using the databases 
Medline, PsycINFO and Embase.  The major outcome measure was mean total 
fuss/cry duration during 24 hours at 1-2 weeks (11 samples), 3-4 weeks (6 samples); 
5-6 weeks (28 samples), 8-9 weeks (9 samples) and 10-12 weeks (12 samples).  
Results: Of 5687 articles reviewed, 28 diary studies (33 samples) were suitable for 
inclusion in meta-analysis. The studies included 8690 infants. No statistical evidence 
for a universal crying peak at 6 weeks across studies was found. Rather, the mean 
fuss/cry duration across studies was stable at around 117-133 minutes (SDs: 66-70) in 
the first 6 weeks and dropped to a mean of around 68 minutes (SD: 46.2) by 10-12 
weeks. Colic was much more frequent in the first 6 weeks (17-25%) than thereafter 
(11% by 8-9 weeks and 0.6% by 10-12 weeks) according to modified Wessel criteria 
and lowest in Denmark and Japan. 
Conclusions: Fuss/cry duration drops significantly after 8-9 weeks of age with colic 
as defined by modified Wessel criteria being rare in infants older than 9 weeks. Colic 
or excessive fuss/cry may be more accurately identified by defining fuss/cry above the 
90th percentile in the chart provided based on the review.

Introduction 
Colic is a common source of concern for parents, a frequent reason for seeking 
help and advice from health care professionals 1,2 and a trigger for abusive head 
trauma (previously shaken baby syndrome).3 However, definitions for colic vary 
widely ranging from gastrointestinal symptoms 4,5 to inconsolable crying6 which has 
resulted in variations of the prevalence rate from 1.5% to 11.9%.7 Increasingly colic is 
defined in terms of total daily duration of fussing and crying. 8-11 The most widely 
used definition for colic is the “Rule of Three’s”12: an infant is considered to have 
colic if the infant fusses or cries for >3 hours, >3 days per week, for >3 weeks. 
However, it is impracticable for parents to assess and document fuss/cry duration for a 
3-week period using detailed diaries. 13 Thus, “modified Wessel criteria“ are most 
often used, requiring the infant to have fussed/cried for more than three hours a day, 
on at least three days in any one week. 12,14,15 
Although the modified Wessel criteria are widely used, firstly, normative 
studies in the general infant population are lacking 15 Secondly, considerable changes 
in infant care have occurred over the last 60 years since the Wessel criteria were 
published,16,17 thus prevalence may be quite different than in the 1950s. Thirdly, while 
modified Wessel criteria have been used in different countries, the impact of cultural 
variations such as caregiving styles 18-23 and maternal soothing techniques 23,24 on the 
duration of infant fussing and crying may need to be taken into consideration. 
Furthermore, the cry/fuss duration may depend on the patterns of feeding (breast vs. 
bottle).25 Finally, several studies have documented a developmental pattern of fuss/cry 
duration in the first three months of life, 1,26-29 indicating a gradual increase that peaks 
at 5-6 weeks of age with a decrease to half the amount by 3-4 months of age. 
  
 
 
5 
18,22,27,28,30,31 This “normal crying curve” has been interpreted as universal across 
cultures 18 although some have not found evidence for it. 20,32,33  
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of fuss/cry durations 
reported in diary studies from around the world. Twenty-four hour behavior diaries 
are considered to be the international gold standard for measurement. 14,34-36 We 
investigated, firstly, what is the change in fuss/cry duration over the first 12 weeks of 
life and is there a universal “crying curve” (5-6 week fuss/cry duration peak)? 
Secondly, do mean fuss/cry duration vary across studies in different countries, 
according to feeding type or study quality? Thirdly, what is the prevalence of colic 
according to the modified Wessel criteria at different ages in the first 12 weeks?  
Methods 
The current meta-analysis was conducted in line with PRISMA (Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines.37 
We searched the databases Medline (1964 - December 2015), PsycINFO 
(1964 - December 2015) and Embase (1964 - December 2015) using the search 
headings “infant and crying” OR “crying and amount” OR “crying and duration” OR 
“fussing and infant”. In addition, infant cry researchers who had participated in the 
International Cry Research Workshops were approached concerning unpublished data. 
Finally, we conducted a separate bibliography search and included all new relevant 
research.  
Criteria for inclusion of articles in the analysis were as follows: 1) at least one 
24-hour behavior diary to measure fuss/cry duration; 2) unselected sample, i.e. no 
infants had been excluded according to fuss/cry duration (e.g. only colic infants or all 
non-colic infants); 3) observation study (i.e. no intervention trial); 4) infant age 
between 1 and 13 weeks; and 5) the authors reported (or provided after request) mean 
  
 
 
6 
fuss/cry duration as well as distribution indices (i.e. standard deviation (SD)). For the 
colic prevalence analysis, only the studies which reported at least three 24-hour 
behavior diaries were included in order to meet the modified Wessel criteria. 
Abstracts were screened according to the selection and inclusion criteria explained 
above by two authors each screening half of the abstracts (AB, MS). Study selection 
and data extraction were performed independently by two authors (AB, DW). 
The quality of studies was evaluated according to 8 criteria: a) subject 
selection (whole vs. convenience population); b) recruitment rate (> 50% vs. < 50%), 
c) participation rate (> 75% vs. < 75%), d) sample size (> 101 vs. <101), e) whether 
the following four sample characteristics were reported: socioeconomic status, parity, 
infant sex, and maternal age (3 of 4 reported vs. <3 reported), f) feeding type 
(reported vs. not reported), g) resolution time for the diary (5 min. vs. 15 min.), h) 
number of days requested for diary (> 4 vs. < 4 days), and, i) whether modified 
Wessel criteria were employed. Each sample, at each measurement age, received a 
score of 0 or 1 for each of the criteria. A score of 0 was also given in cases where the 
information for the criterion was not reported. The individual scores were summed to 
give a total quality score that could range from 0 to 8 (Table 1).  
The major outcome measure was mean total fuss/cry duration during 24 hours. 
The studies were grouped according to assessment age: 1-2 weeks (11 samples), 3-4 
weeks (6 samples); 5-6 weeks (28 samples), 8-9 weeks (9 samples) and 10-12 weeks 
(12 samples). Furthermore, information regarding the sample size and feeding type 
(bottle-fed, breastfed, mixed) was extracted from the articles.  
To test question 1 (fuss/cry peak duration), we calculated a weighted mean and 
the pooled weighted standard deviation (SD) for each period (Figure 2, A). To test for 
mean differences, ANOVA was performed between individual weighted means. To 
  
 
 
7 
evaluate the prevalence of colic, 3 samples which used the diaries for less than 3 days 
were removed from the 8-9 weeks analysis. The prevalence of colic for each study at 
each assessment point was computed according to the modified-Wessel criteria and 
overall prevalence rates are reported as weighted mean and pooled weighted standard 
deviation.  
Meta-analysis was conducted with the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) 
software. 38 Effect sizes are reported as standardized mean difference with 95% 
confidence intervals for each study. The mean difference (Cohen’s d) compares the 
individual study’s mean to the overall weighted mean across studies at each 
assessment time. A d of .20 is a small, .50 medium and .80 or more a large effect.39 
Effect sizes were analyzed using the random effects model, in which the error term is 
composed of variation originating from both within-study variability and between-
study differences.40,41  
The distribution of effect sizes was examined using tests of heterogeneity. 
Significant heterogeneity indicates that differences across effect sizes are likely due to 
sources other than sampling error, such as different study characteristics. Categorical 
moderator tests were applied to test for within groups Q (Qw) and between groups Q 
(Qb). A significant value for Qw indicates that the effect sizes within a category of the 
moderator variable are heterogeneous, whereas a significant value for Qb indicates 
that the effect sizes are significantly different across different categories of the 
moderator variable. Meta-regression analyses were performed to test quality 
assessment as a continuous moderator. 
We examined the potential for publication bias by using two methods 
suggested for observational studies. First, biases according to study size were assessed 
  
 
 
8 
with use of the Begg and Mazumdar42 rank correlation test (Kendall's tau b). Second, 
the Duval and Tweedie43,44 'Trim and Fill' method was applied.  
Results 
The online search yielded 5680 articles, 1578 of which were duplicates. After 
removing the duplicates, the overall systematic literature search included 4102 
articles. An additional seven potential studies were identified through searches of 
bibliographies and from the Infant Cry Research Workshops (Figure 1; online only).  
We reviewed the titles and abstracts of all articles found (N: 4109), resulting in 227 
abstracts for additional review. A total of 89 full-text articles were independently 
reviewed by two authors (AB, DW), which resulted in exclusion of 43 articles based 
on the inclusion criteria. Among the remaining forty-six articles, there were 18 studies 
with missing data which required their authors to be contacted to obtain further 
information about the fuss/cry duration or moderator variables. However, some 
authors were not able to provide missing data (e.g., means, SD etc.) 8,14,15,22,45-49 or 
could not be reached; 50-54 and some studies did not meet the inclusion criteria (e.g. 
selected population, no fuss/cry duration data etc.) 55-58. These studies were therefore 
not included in the meta-analysis. Five study reports 20,21,59-61 reported on more than 
one sample, resulting in a total of twenty-eight articles with 33 samples being 
included in the meta-analysis (Table 1). The majority of the studies used at least 3 
days diary except 3 samples from 2 study reports.60,62 The studies included in the 
analysis with their quality rating scores and descriptions of each study are shown in 
Table 1.  
The overall agreement in the selection of articles according to the predefined 
criteria was Cohen’s k= 0.89 at the full-text retrieval stage. The discrepancies in 
articles were discussed and mutually resolved by the coders.

Fuss/cry duration across 1-12 weeks 
Mean fuss/cry duration 
The weighted mean average for each period was computed (see Figure 2, A). As 
shown, mean fuss/cry durations were around 117-133 minutes (SDs: 66-70) in the 
first 6 weeks and then dropped to around 68 minutes (SD: 46) by 10-12 weeks. Post-
hoc comparisons showed that fuss/cry duration did not significantly differ from each 
other across the first 6 weeks. However, the fuss/cry duration at 10-12 weeks (M: 
68.03, SD: 46.2) was significantly lower than at 1-2 weeks (M: 117.3, SD: 66.8; p< 
.001); 3-4 weeks (M: 118.2, SD: 69.3; p<. 01); and 5-6 weeks (M: 133.3, SD: 70.1; p< 
.001).  
 
Potential Moderator Variables 
Country 
Random effects meta-analyses (Figure 3; online only) showed that the standardized 
fuss/cry duration means in Germany at 1-2 (M: 69, SD: 60) weeks and 3-4 weeks of 
age (M: 80.8, SD: 67.4) and in Japan at 5-6 weeks age (M: 107, SD: 36) were 
significantly lower than the overall weighted average mean (Figure 3; online only). 
Similarly, the standardized fuss/cry duration means in Denmark were significantly 
lower than the overall weighted average mean across the first 12 weeks except 8-9 
weeks of age. On the other hand, the standardized fuss/cry duration mean in Canada at 
3-4 weeks of age (M: 149.8, SD: 73.5) and in The Netherlands at 5-6 weeks of age 
(M: 150.4, SD: 66.3) was significantly higher than the overall weighted fuss/cry 
duration mean (Table 2). The Q test for heterogeneity was significant at each age (p < 
0.001).

Feeding Type 
Feeding type was found to be a significant moderator at 1-2 weeks (Qb=22.91; p < 
0.001), 5-6 weeks (Qb=12.28; p < 0.01), and at 10-12 weeks (Qb=21.01; p < 0.001). 
Samples which included babies who were bottle-fed (z = -3.461; p<0.01) or mixed-
fed (breast and bottle) (z = -3.656; p<0.01) had significantly lower fuss/cry durations 
than the overall weighted fuss/cry mean at 5-6 weeks. In contrast, samples which 
included babies who were breastfed had significantly higher fuss/cry durations at 3-4 
weeks (z = 3.500; p<0.01). Furthermore, samples that did not report on the type of 
feeding (1-2 weeks and at 10-12 weeks of age) reported significantly higher fuss/cry 
durations than the overall weighted fuss/cry. 
Quality Assessment 
Univariate meta-regression analyses indicated a positive significant moderating 
influence of study quality at 8-9 weeks of age (the slope: point estimate= 0.15; z= 
4.09; SE= 0.04; p < 0.001; Qb= 16.79; df: 1; p <0.001): As study quality increased, 
fuss/cry duration also increased. 
Prevalence of colic  
We calculated the overall mean weighted colic prevalence of all studies at each 
assessment point (Figure 2, B). Mean colic prevalence at 10-12 weeks (0.6%) was 
significantly lower than the mean colic prevalence at 1-2 weeks (17.4%, z=2.95; p < 
0.01), 3-4 weeks (18.4%, z=3.40; p < 0.001), 5-6 weeks (25.1%, z=3.64; p < 0.001) 
and 8-9 weeks (10.8%, z=2.93, p<0.01). Furthermore, it was found that colic 
prevalence at 5-6 weeks was significantly higher than colic prevalence at 8-9 weeks 
(z=2.01; p<0.05). 
 
  
 
 
11 
 
Potential Moderator Variables 
Significant moderating effects were observed for country at 1-2 weeks (Qb=16.24; 
p < 0.01), 3-4 weeks (Qb=22.91; p < 0.001), and 8-9 weeks (Qb=9.44; p < 0.05).  The 
average standardized difference (d) in mean colic prevalence of the UK studies at 1-2 
weeks (28%), Canada at 3-4 weeks (34.1%), and Italy at 8-9 weeks (20.9%) was 
significantly higher than the overall weighted colic prevalence. In contrast, Denmark 
(5.5%) and Germany (6.7%) had lower colic rates at 3-4 weeks of age (Table 2). 
Although country was not a significant moderator at 5-6 weeks, fewer infants with 
colic were reported across all Danish studies (6.7%), the Japanese study (2.1%) and 
the UK studies (18.1%) compared to the overall prevalence.  
Feeding type was found to be a significant moderator at 5-6 weeks (Qb=14.23; p < 
0.01) and 10-12 weeks of age (Qb=4.55; p < 0.05). At 5-6 weeks, studies that reported 
infants who were bottle-fed (z = -3.87; p < 0.001) and mixed fed (z = -3.54; p < 0.001) 
had lower prevalence of colic. On the other hand, at 10-12 weeks studies that did not 
report the feeding type (6 studies) had significantly higher colic prevalence (z = 2.62; 
p < 0.05) compared to overall weighted colic prevalence.  
The homogeneity analysis was significant at the following ages: 1-2 weeks: 
Q=29.42; p < 0.01; 3-4 weeks: Q=24.87; p< 0.001; 5-6 weeks: Q=74.57; p<0.001.  
Quality Assessment 
Univariate meta-regression analyses showed that study quality had a positive 
significant moderating influence at 8-9 weeks of age (the slope: point estimate= 0.53; 
z= 2.57; SE= 0.21; p < 0.05; Qb= 6.61; df: 1; p <0.5). Increased quality of study was 
associated with increased prevalence of colic.  
 
  
 
 
12 
 
Publication Bias  
The Begg and Mazumdar Rank Correlation Test (correlation between study size 
and effect size) suggest that there was little evidence for publication bias.  
We assessed the possibility of publication bias by using a funnel plot to assess for 
asymmetry. The Duval and Tweedie's Trim and Fill method indicates that two studies 
are missing left to the mean at 1-2 weeks (combined studies: 0.01; 95% CI: -0.23 – 
0.26; using trim and fill the imputed point estimate: -0.08; 95% CI: -0.32 - 0.16), three 
studies are missing left to the mean at 3-4 weeks (combined studies: -0.02; 95% CI: -
0.38 to 0.34; using trim and fill the imputed point estimate: 0.29; 95% CI: -0.67 to 
0.09) and three studies are missing left to the mean at 10-12 weeks (combined studies: 
0.14; 95% CI: -0.09 to 0.38; using trim and fill the imputed point estimate: -0.01; 95% 
CI: -0.26 to 0.24). 
 
Discussion 
 
This review and meta-analysis investigated mean fuss/cry duration and 
prevalence of colic in diary studies from around the world. Firstly, no statistical 
evidence was found for a “universal” increase of fuss/cry duration over the first 6 
weeks of life culminating in a “crying peak” at 5-6 weeks as proposed previously,28,29 
although visual inspection shows a slight increase 63. Overall, fuss/cry durations were 
high across the first 6 weeks of life, then reduced significantly over the following 6 
weeks. All studies found a “universal” reduction in fuss/cry duration between 6 and 
12 weeks of age. The average fuss/cry durations were around 117-133 minutes in the 
first 6 weeks and then dropped to a mean of around 68 minutes by 10-12 weeks.  
Secondly, the significant differences in mean fuss/cry durations between 
studies were moderated by country of origin. The most consistent finding was the 
  
 
 
13 
lower fuss/cry durations reported in Denmark at several age points 32. On the other 
hand, with the exception of Denmark, no consistent pattern for significantly higher 
fuss/cry duration between other countries was found. At different assessment ages, 
studies from the Netherlands 64 and Canada 65,66 had significantly higher fuss/cry 
durations compared to the overall mean weighted fuss/cry duration.  
The findings regarding the country differences appear robust according to 
publication bias results. However, we can only speculate on the reasons why there are 
country differences, in particular between Denmark and the rest of Europe and North 
America. These could range from economic conditions, such as less social inequality, 
to caretaking patterns such as responsiveness, carrying behavior and management in 
Denmark that have been shown to differ from the UK. 20 However, there may also be 
population genetic differences, and the infants both inherit their parents’ genes and are 
reared by them (gene-environment correlation). 67 Nevertheless, further analysis of 
caretaking patterns may prove to provide clues for effective preventative strategies. 
Feeding type was a further moderator of fuss/cry duration. Bottle or mixed feeding 
was associated with reduced duration of fussing and crying or colic from 3-4 weeks 
onwards. Switch in feeding type is one frequently adopted method by parents dealing 
with a crying baby 68and has been found to reduce crying regardless of what formula 
change is instituted, suggesting a placebo effect.69 Feeding type has also been 
previously reported to be associated with more night waking in infants. 70,71 Night 
waking is often signaled by fussing or crying and thus may have increased the total 
fuss/cry duration in diary reports in those breast feeding. Alternatively, cultural 
differences might have influenced the accuracy of diary keeping. Furthermore, 
mothers’ perception of the frequency of their infants’ crying might be enhanced by 
cultural variations in support for shouldering the burden in caring for their infant.  
  
 
 
14 
Thirdly, the prevalence of colic according to Wessel’s modified criteria ranged 
from 17-25% in the first 6 weeks, and then reduced to less than 11% by 8-9 weeks 
and finally, to only 0.6% by 10-12 weeks. Notably, the lowest colic prevalence rate 
was found for Danish infants (around 6%) and Japanese (2%) infants during the first 6 
weeks. In contrast, the highest mean prevalence rate was found for the UK studies at 
1-2 weeks (ranged from 17% to 47%). If colic is considered the extreme of a normal 
distribution of fuss/cry duration, then it is not surprising that fewer infants with colic 
were found in Denmark where the mean fuss/cry duration was lower than in other 
countries. However, if alternatively, colic is considered to be qualitatively different 
from normal fussing and crying 8 then a similar prevalence should have been found 
across countries. Our findings are consistent with the first interpretation that colic 
reflects the extreme of normal fuss/cry distribution. Further, but less consistent, 
moderation of colic prevalence was found by feeding type. There was a weak trend 
for infants who were bottle or mixed-fed to have lower prevalence of colic at 5-6 
weeks.  
There are strengths and limitations that require comment. This is the first 
review that has quantitatively evaluated changes in mean fuss/cry durations and colic 
prevalence across studies from different countries. The study only included those with 
diary measures: all but 360,72 used 5-minute resolution and most samples had 3 or 
more days of diaries. On the other hand, there were unequal numbers of studies from 
different countries. Although we identified empirical studies in Australia, Iran and 
Korea, despite contacting the authors, the required distribution measures were not 
available. Thus, this is a review of studies in North America and parts of Europe with 
only one study from Japan. No studies from threshold or developing countries were 
available but these would be needed to provide adequate feedback to parents on other 
  
 
 
15 
continents. Feeding type information was also not available for some studies. 
Abstracts were screened by two of the authors. If there was any doubt, full texts were 
retrieved. We consider it unlikely that relevant studies with diary data were missed, 
but it cannot be excluded. Moreover, there might be a loss of studies in the title and 
abstract screening procedure which was conducted by one author. Furthermore, 
multiple statistical comparisons were not Bonferroni adjusted and need to be 
interpreted cautiously. Finally, the lack of a significant peak at 5-6 weeks of age 
should be interpreted cautiously since our study might be underpowered to detect a 
small peak amounting to 15 minutes. 
Conclusion 
 There are several implications for research on colic and clinical practice. 
Firstly, colic is best defined as the extreme of the distribution of fuss/cry duration. 
Secondly, the cut-off points need to take into account the rapid developmental 
changes occurring in fuss/cry durations during the first 3 months. The modified 
Wessel criteria may have served researchers or clinicians well for more than sixty 
years but may be inaccurate when applied at any time across the first 3 months. As 
shown here, fuss/cry duration is highest in the first 6 weeks and reduces rapidly 
during the next 6 weeks. Thus cut-off points need to be determined for the first 6 
weeks, at 8-9 weeks and 10-12 weeks. Figure 4 provides a percentile chart for 
“average” and “excessive” fussing and crying on basis of this meta-analysis across 
countries, allowing clinicians an approximation of whether the infant is excessively 
fussing or crying according to age or within the normal range. This feedback to 
parents is a first step of psycho education on fussing or crying and whether their 
infant’s fuss/cry is within the normal range. Those above the 90th percentile may be 
identified as excessive criers or infants with colic. Thirdly, as the mean fuss/cry 
  
 
 
16 
duration was found to vary between countries, future normative country specific 
studies may be required on representative samples. Nevertheless, the provided 
percentile chart (Figure 4) provides a more accurate estimate of normal to excessive 
fuss/cry duration of infants in industrialized countries than previously provided by 
individual studies. Fourthly, the rapid developmental change in fuss/cry duration has 
implications for treatment and interpretation of treatment studies. Consistent with 
recent advice, 29 colic is the extreme of normal fuss/cry behavior, self-limiting and 
thus the vast majority will spontaneously remit. Adequate management of fussing and 
crying in the first 3 months rather than treatment may be required.73 However, if 
excessive fuss/cry persists beyond the first 3 months, there is increasing evidence that 
this may indicate regulatory problems with adverse consequences for future 
development and may require treatment.74
