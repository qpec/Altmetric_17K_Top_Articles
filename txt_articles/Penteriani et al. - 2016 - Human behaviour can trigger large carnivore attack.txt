The media and scientific literature are increasingly reporting an escalation of large carnivore attacks on 
humans in North America and Europe. Although rare compared to human fatalities by other wildlife, 
the media often overplay large carnivore attacks on humans, causing increased fear and negative 
attitudes towards coexisting with and conserving these species. Although large carnivore populations 
are generally increasing in developed countries, increased numbers are not solely responsible for the 
observed rise in the number of attacks by large carnivores. Here we show that an increasing number 
of people are involved in outdoor activities and, when doing so, some people engage in risk-enhancing 
behaviour that can increase the probability of a risky encounter and a potential attack. About half of 
the well-documented reported attacks have involved risk-enhancing human behaviours, the most 
common of which is leaving children unattended. Our study provides unique insight into the causes, 
and as a result the prevention, of large carnivore attacks on people. Prevention and information that 
can encourage appropriate human behaviour when sharing the landscape with large carnivores are 
of paramount importance to reduce both potentially fatal human-carnivore encounters and their 
consequences to large carnivores.
During the last few decades, large carnivore attacks on humans in developed countries have increased over time1–8  
(Fig. 1). This is expected to increase people’s apprehension and reduce their willingness to share the landscape 
with large carnivores. Unfortunately, such rare events are usually overplayed by the media. Indeed, media cover-
age of such attacks generally includes sensational texts and dreadful pictures (Extended Data 1), appealing more 
to the public’s emotions than their logic. Denominator neglect9 is a well-studied phenomenon leading humans to 
overestimate the risk of rare events that evoke strong emotions. Overestimating the risk of large carnivore attacks 
on humans irrationally enhances human fear and triggers a vicious cycle that may affect the increasingly posi-
tive conservation status of many of these contentious species10–12. With an increasing number of large carnivore 
attacks on humans there is, now more than ever, a need for objective and accurate information regarding not 
only the long-term trend and underlying mechanisms of large carnivore attacks on humans, but also potentially 
risky situations and risk-enhancing human behaviours8. Surprisingly, the few available studies focus on attacks by

single carnivore species and thus they do not provide a comprehensive perspective concerning the pervasiveness 
and socio-ecological correlates of this phenomenon in developed countries.
Our main hypothesis is that lack of knowledge of people about how to avoid risky encounters with large car-
nivores engenders risk-enhancing behaviours, which can determine an increase in the number of attacks if more 
humans are sharing landscape with large carnivores. Three main predictions arise from this hypothesis: (1) an 
increased number of people are engaging in outdoor leisure activities in areas inhabited by large carnivores; (2) 
many people are not prepared to safely enjoy outdoor activities or they behave inappropriately in the countryside; 
and (3) large carnivore attacks are influenced by the interaction between several human- and animal-related 
factors.
Thus, we first explored whether the long-term patterns in the number of attacks have been similar among dif-
ferent large carnivore species, and how they varied throughout the year. Then, we evaluated whether there might 
have been a general long-term change in the attack patterns by assessing whether victim ages and the frequency 
of attacks on parties vs. lone humans have changed in a congruent manner for the different species. Finally, we 
assessed the possible relationships between temporal trends of attacks on humans and outdoor activities, as well 
as the role that risk-enhancing human behaviour can have played in the observed increase in large carnivore 
attacks.
Figure 1. Temporal trends in large carnivore attacks on humans in developed countries. The number 
of attacks on humans by large carnivores has increased significantly (Extended Data Table 1) during the last 
few decades for almost all large carnivores. The left panel shows the relationship between the number of large 
carnivore attacks in the US and the number of visitors (hundreds of millions, red line) in American protected 
areas since 1955, which has increased significantly over time (Extended Data Table 4). The right panels show 
(from top to bottom) the temporal trends in large carnivore attacks in Canada, as well as the trends of polar 
bear (Europe, Russia, the United States and Canada) and European brown bear (Sweden, Finland and Spain) 
attacks. It is worth noting that: (i) conflicts with polar bears have been increasing in the last decade. Causal 
factors include a growing human population and more tourists visiting polar bear areas, increased oil and gas 
development along the Arctic coastline, and decreasing ice volume and seasonal extent due to climate change63. 
Indeed, human-polar bear encounters are expected to increase as the sea ice continues to melt and hungry 
bears are driven ashore (http://www.polarbearsinternational.org/about-polar-bears/essentials/attacks-and-
encounters; http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/04/polar-bear-attacks-scientists-warn-warming-
arctic); (ii) the remarkable increase in coyote attacks may be related to both the recent substantial expansion 
of the coyote range in eastern North America64 and increased conflicts in suburban residential areas. In these 
areas, coyotes can relax human avoidance mechanisms as a result of relying on anthropogenic food resources 
and even intentional feeding by residents4; and (iii) wolves were the only species to show a decreasing trend in 
the number of attacks, declining from 10 attacks during the decade 1975–1984 to only two or three attacks per 
decade starting in 1985. (The brown bear picture has been downloaded from 123RF ROYALTY FREE STOCK

We analysed the circumstances of ca. 700 large carnivore attacks on people from 1955 in detail (when more 
reliable data became available) until the present for six species responsible for most of the large carnivore attacks 
recorded in North America and Europe: brown/grizzly bear Ursus arctos, black bear Ursus americanus, cougar 
Puma concolor, wolf Canis lupus and coyote Canis latrans in North America, brown bear in Europe, and polar 
bear Ursus maritimus circumpolar, i.e. Europe, Russia and North America. We also collected statistics concerning 
outdoor activities during the same period (see Methods for more details).
The number of large carnivore attacks on people has increased significantly over time, with contrasting trends 
across species (Fig. 1; Extended Data Table 1). In North America, coyotes (31.0% of the total number of attacks) 
and cougars (25.7%) were responsible for the majority of attacks, followed by brown bears (13.2%), black bears 
(12.2%) and wolves (6.7%). A similar increase over time was observed for brown bears (9.3%) in Europe and cir-
cumpolar for polar bears (1.9%; Fig. 1). Moreover: (a) the age of victims has also increased significantly over time 
showing different patterns across species (Extended Data Table 2 and Extended Data Fig. 1); and (b) the propen-
sity to attack lone humans or parties depends on the large carnivore species, and only a slight but non-significant 
increasing trend of attacks on parties has been observed (Extended Data Table 3 and Extended Data Fig. 2A,B).
The patterns of attacks reported here may also reflect an increasing number of bold individuals in large carni-
vore populations, as this trait is often correlated with aggressiveness13,14, and this might lead to more aggressive 
responses when large carnivores encounter humans. We hypothesise that intense and prolonged human-caused 
mortality imposes selection pressures on target populations (selective removal of certain phenotypes) and might 
lead to rapid evolutionary changes15. Natural selection maintains a mix of behavioural phenotypes in popula-
tions16, the shy-bold behavioural continuum17; bold individuals thrive on risk and novelty, whereas shy individu-
als shrink from the same situations18. Persecution, however, is expected to result in the disproportionate removal 
of bold individuals, as they are less cautious19, and thus more likely to be killed. As a consequence, shy individ-
uals might have been overrepresented in remnant large carnivore populations in the past17,18,20–22. Additionally, 
individuals may become more vigilant and actively avoid contact with humans during times of intense persecu-
tion23. Although the history of large carnivore persecution and conservation differ across regions9, the contempo-
rary conservation paradigm emerged during the 1960s–1970s24, when most bounty systems were banned25 and 
large carnivores were reclassified from vermins or bountied predators to game or protected species. Since then, 
although large carnivores have continued to be hunted or managed (Extended Data Fig. 3), most populations 
have generally increased during the past four decades9,11,12. Increasing population trends in conjunction with 
relaxed artificial selection may potentially engender higher variation in behavioural temperaments26, which is 
likely to alter individual responses to human encounters22. This significant increase of large carnivore populations 
in both North America and Europe, and their consequent range expansion, also may contribute to explain the 
observed increase in the attacks on humans.
However, similar to the increasing trend in attacks, the number of people engaging in outdoor leisure activities 
also has risen over time, a phenomenon that is significantly correlated with the observed trend in the number 
of attacks (Fig. 1; Extended Data Table 4, Extended Data Fig. 4A–C). Seasonally, most of the attacks occurred 
between late spring and early autumn (Fig. 2), when most people pursue outdoor activities7,8; in addition, because 
bears hibernate, they are unlikely to attack people in winter. Such an increase in recreational activities in areas 
inhabited by large carnivores implicitly increases the probability of a risky encounter and, therefore, a potential 
attack. However, even with more people visiting those areas, attacks are still extremely rare (Fig. 1): although 
some people may only focus on the total number of attacks, we have to bear in mind the long time period during 
which these attacks occurred.
Figure 2. Temporal trends in large carnivore attacks on humans in developed countries: monthly patterns. 
Most large carnivore attacks occurred from late spring to early autumn, when most people usually engage in 
outdoor activities. (The coyote picture has been downloaded from 123RF ROYALTY FREE STOCK PHOTOS

Remarkably, risk-enhancing human behaviour has been involved in at least half of the well-documented 
attacks (47.6%; Fig. 3). From highest to lowest, the five most common human behaviours occurring at the time of 
an attack were (a) parents leaving children unattended, (b) walking an unleashed dog, (c) searching for a wounded 
large carnivore during hunting, (d) engaging in outdoor activities at twilight/night and (e) approaching a female 
with young. These are clearly risk-enhancing behaviours when sharing the landscape with large carnivores. For 
example, the most frequently recorded human behaviour was children left unattended (47.3%), which were most 
often attacked by cougars (50.8% of the attacks), coyotes (27.9%) and black bears (13.2%). Risk-enhancing human 
behaviour is not the sole reason behind large carnivore attacks on humans. The causes of the other half of the 
attacks do not seem to be related to risk-enhancing human behaviour, for example, accidentally walking close to a 
mother with young or to a carcass with a bear nearby or an encounter with a food-conditioned individual (which 
is an indirect result of a risk-enhancing human behaviour8).
Thousands of interactions occur between people and large carnivores with no human injuries or fatalities. 
Even if attacks have increased over time, they remain extremely rare events (e.g. a cross-continental average of 
24.1 attacks and 3.9 fatalities per year during the last decade, all species pooled; Fig. 1). Other wildlife (bees and 
mosquitos, spiders, snails, snakes and ungulates) and domestic dogs are far more responsible for human fatali-
ties1,27. But humans are not the only victims. When attacks occur, large carnivores are frequently killed and nega-
tive attitudes towards large carnivores harden6. Lethal removal of ‘problematic’ individuals is effective in solving 
the local problem caused by a given individual28, but generally this happens after an aggressive behaviour, human 
injury or death has occurred. Consequently, both humans and carnivores suffer from these incidents.
After decades of minimal interaction between humans and large carnivores in many regions of developed 
countries, many people involved in outdoor activities may lack knowledge about how to avoid risky encounters 
with large carnivores and what to do when such encounters occur. From an early age most of us learn social 
norms, rules and how to decrease risks in urban environmental settings, but much less effort is expended to 
teach us how to safely enjoy outdoor activities or to behave appropriately in the countryside. However, it is up 
to us to reduce the likelihood of an attack. The increasing human presence in areas inhabited by large carni-
vores, together with their population recoveries9,11,12, requires an improvement in information, education and 
prevention guidelines, and their enforcement, which are of paramount importance to reduce both the risks to 
humans and the killing of carnivores1,4,7,28,29. Educating people that share landscape with large carnivores can 
represent a crucial factor to help reducing the number of attacks and also the negative attitudes towards large 
carnivore conservation, especially because of the difficulty to envisage risk estimates. Indeed, scenarios of attacks 
are extremely different and may depend on many different factors, such as human population and carnivore 
densities, time of the day, human activities, personality and condition of the large carnivore, party size or even 
subtle details, like the presence of an unleashed dog at the moment of the attack and/or the landscape features of 
the area where an attack has happened. As conflicts between humans and large carnivores continue to increase, 
accurate information becomes crucial to informed human–wildlife conflict management. Communicating about 
large carnivore-inflicted human injuries and fatalities in a statistical manner contributes to better understanding 
of common patterns in large carnivore attacks, further reduces chances of injury or death and promotes public 
appreciation of these species. An important strategy to reduce attacks on humans is to inform people how to avoid 
Figure 3. The number of attacks is modulated by human behaviour. Around half of the attacks were 
associated with risk-enhancing human behaviours. Out of 271 well-documented attacks, 47.6% were associated 
with certain human behaviours that may have contributed to the probability of suffering an attack. Within 
the principal category (children left unattended by their parents), the main species responsible for 91.9% of 
these attacks were cougars (50.8%), coyotes (27.9%) and black bears (13.2%). (The cougar picture has been

and manage aggressive encounters. But nowadays, educational and interpretive efforts aimed at decreasing the 
risk of large carnivore attacks should not focus exclusively on people living in rural and wilderness areas. Indeed, 
many people living in cities should also be included within the category of groups at risk because of the increasing 
number of them enjoying outdoor activities in areas inhabited by large carnivores and the expanding population 
of carnivores (mainly coyotes) in suburban areas.
Although large carnivore attacks on humans are influenced by the interaction between multiple human- and 
animal-related factors, adapting our own behaviours when coexisting with large carnivores has the potential to 
reduce the number of attacks to about half of today’s level. The examples provided by the numerous cases of chil-
dren injured/killed while left unattended by their parents, attacks on people jogging/walking alone at twilight and 
during hunting, should make us reflect on our responsibilities, the possibility of decreasing the number of these 
tragic events and changing the observed trends. Understanding the circumstances associated with large carnivore 
attacks should help us to reduce them and thereby minimize the role that fear and supposition may play in large 
carnivore management and conservation.
Methods
Collection of records of large carnivore attacks on humans. 
Records of large carnivore attacks (i.e. 
attacks resulting in physical injury or death) on humans for the brown bear, black bear, cougar, wolf and coyote 
were collected for North America (the United States and Canada). In addition, with the aim to broaden our 
research and obtain a general picture of large carnivore attacks on humans in developed countries, we com-
plemented the North American dataset with information on brown bear attacks in three European countries 
(Sweden, Finland and Spain) as well as data on attacks by polar bears in Europe (Svalbard; Norway), Russia, the 
United States, and Canada. Our time period spanned from 1955 to 2014 and our search resulted in a total of 697 
attacks of large carnivores on people.
We consider that we both recorded the majority of such events occurring during the last six decades in these 
developed countries and avoided bias due to possible changes in reporting probability given (i) the large number 
of experienced people involved in the work (some of them had their own database on attacks, which started at the 
beginning of the 1900s), (ii) the multiple sources of information used to collect recorded attacks and (iii) the sen-
sational nature and media impacts of attacks that end with injuries or the death of the victim since the beginning 
of the past century. Records of attacks were collected from unpublished reports and PhD/MS theses, webpages 
(last accessed in November 2014, but currently available at the specific addresses listed by species below), books 
and scientific articles, as well as personal datasets from some of the co-authors. In addition, to complete the data 
obtained from the above-cited sources, we also collected dozens of news reports from online newspapers. To do 
this, for each species and area, we searched on an annual basis for news articles on Google using the combination 
of the following terms: “species name” + 
 “attack” and “species name” + 
 “attack” + 
 “human”
. Because of the use 
of multiple sources, several attacks recurred repeatedly during the search, but we used information such as date, 
locality and sex/age of the victims to prevent duplicate records in the dataset. However, the lack of some records 
would still not result in a bias in the general patterns we observed in the present work, because: (i) we followed 
the same procedure for each species and, thus, we collected at least an equally biased sample of attacks per species 
and (ii) patterns of attacks on humans over time are less sensitive to unequally biased samples of attacks than 
quantitative comparisons of the frequency of attacks across species (which is not the aim of the present work).
When possible, we recorded the following information for each attack: (1) species; (2) year; (3) month; (4) 
country; (5) time of the attack during the day (which we classified into three categories: twilight, day, night); (6) 
activity of the victim (15 categories: hunting, fishing, field work, camping, hiking, jogging, skiing, biking, horse 
riding, fruit/mushroom picking, photography, walking, dog walking, activity near the house/in the backyard, 
playing); (7) size of party being attacked (simplified into three categories: victim alone, child – from 0 to 16 years 
old– in a party of adults, adult – > 
16 years old – in a party of adults); (8) end of the attack, i.e. attack resulting in 
human injuries or death; and (9) scenario when the attack occurred, i.e. the factor that could have triggered the 
attack. We were able to delineate eight categories: female with young, aggressive reaction after a sudden encoun-
ter (i.e. a person surprises the large carnivore at close range), food defence (e.g. a bear close to a carcass), food 
conditioning (i.e. encounter with a large carnivore that consumes human-derived foods, consequently associating 
people with easily accessible, attractive foods, and which has lost much of its avoidance mechanisms towards 
humans), predatory (i.e. when the large carnivore exploited a human as prey), wounded animal (i.e. during hunt-
ing), feeding large carnivores, and presence of one or more dogs. Unleashed dogs can exacerbate the probability 
of a large carnivore attack, because a dog that runs away from a large carnivore towards the owner can trigger a 
dangerous situation when the carnivore chases it30. When dogs were involved, large carnivores usually focused 
their attention on the dog rather than on the person. However, in some instances the human was attacked as a 
consequence of its proximity to the dog or because of its reaction towards the large carnivore.
Below, we describe the sources used to collect data on large carnivore attacks on people for each species since 
1955:
1. North American brown and black bears. We recorded a total of 92 and 85 attacks, respectively. Informa-
tion was compiled from28, Wikipedia List of fatal bear attacks in North America (http://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/List_of_fatal_bear_attacks_in_North_America), Fatal Bear Attack Statistics for the USA & Canada 
(http://www.blackbearheaven.com/bear-attack-statistics.htm) and online newspapers. Additionally, we also 
extracted information for the black bear from8 and California Black Bear Public Safety Incidents, California 
Department of Fish and Wildlife (https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/News/Bear/Bear-Incidents).
2. Cougar. We recorded a total of 179 attacks. Data on attacks were collected from1,31, the List of Mountain 
Lion Attacks (http://www.cougarinfo.org/attacks.htm), Mountain Lion Attacks from 1991 to 2000 (http://
www.cougarinfo.org/attacks2.htm), Mountain Lion Attacks from 2001 to 2010 (http://www.cougarinfo.org/

attacks3.htm), Mountain Lion Attacks from 2011 to Now (http://www.cougarinfo.org/attacks4.htm) and on-
line newspapers.
3. Wolf. We recorded a total of 47 attacks. Data on attacks were collected from32,33, the Wikipedia List of wolf 
attacks in North America (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wolf_attacks_in_North_America), Wikipe-
dia List of wolf attacks (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wolf_attacks), Wolf Attacks on Humans (http://
www.aws.vcn.com/wolf_attacks_on_humans.html) and online newspapers. We did not include the wolf in 
Europe, because predatory attacks on people have been extremely rare during the last six decades, with the 
last recorded predatory attack occurring in 1974 in Spain32.
4. Coyote. We recorded a total of 216 attacks. Data on attacks were collected from4,34–36, the Wikipedia Coyote 
attacks on humans (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coyote_attacks_on_humans), Coyote Attacks on Children 
(http://www.varmintal.com/attac.htm), Coyote Attacks: An Increasing Suburban Problem (http://escholar-
ship.org/uc/item/8qg662fb), Coyote Attacks On People in the U.S. and Canada (http://tchester.org/sgm/lists/
coyote_attacks.html) and online newspapers.
5. European brown bear. We recorded a total of 65 attacks. Information from Spain was available from the un-
published personal database of J.N. and A.F.G., whereas Fennoscandian records were obtained from37,38 and 
unpublished data from I.K., H.N. and J.F.
6. Polar bear. We recorded a total of 13 attacks. Information was recorded from Wikipedia List of fatal bear 
attacks in North America (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fatal_bear_attacks_in_North_America) and 
online newspapers (both North American and European –some attacks have been recently recorded in the 
Norwegian Svalbard archipelago–).
Collection of records on outdoor human activities. 
Data on outdoor activities was only available 
for the US and Sweden. We collected the following information: (1) annual recreation visitation in American 
Protected Areas published by the National Park Service Visitor Use Statistics (IRMA data system), National 
Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior, Natural Resource Stewardship and Science (https://irma.nps.
gov/Stats/Reports/National). To reduce bias in our analyses, we only used information from the National 
Parks located in the 30 states where at least one large carnivore attack occurred since 1955 (Alaska, Arizona, 
California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, 
Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, 
Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wyoming); (2) statistics on number of 
people doing outdoor activities in the US, which were obtained from39, the U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service, and U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Census Bureau40–44; (3) American trends in 
the sporting goods market related to outdoor activities associated with attacks (cross-country training shoes, 
jogging and running shoes, camping, optics, snow skiing, bicycles and related supplies), which were collected 
from the U.S. Census Bureau, Statistical Abstract of the United States45,46; and (4) Statistics Sweden’s time series 
tables concerning outdoor activities, which derive from ULF surveys (Living Conditions Surveys) from 1975 
onwards (http://www.scb.se/sv_/Hitta-statistik/Statistik-efter-amne/Levnadsforhallanden/Levnadsforhallanden/
Undersokningarna-av-levnadsforhallanden-ULFSILC/12202/12209/#). Information on outdoor human activities 
was only used to support the highlighted trends and patterns of large carnivore attacks; thus, its sole function is to 
be supportive to the main text and it was not used in our analyses.
Collection of records on large carnivore harvest. 
We used data from brown bear, black bear, cougar 
and wolf harvests in certain US and Canadian states as examples of trends and numbers in large carnivore harvest 
over time. First, brown bear harvesting records for Alaska and British Columbia were obtained from the Alaska 
Department of Fish and Game47,48 and M. Wolowicz unpublished data (Big Game Harvest Statistics 1976–2012, 
British Columbia), respectively. Second, data on black bear harvesting statistics in Alaska was obtained from the 
Alaska Department of Fish and Game49–51. Third, cougar harvesting records in Colorado, Alberta and British 
Columbia were obtained from52–54, J. Apker unpublished data (Colorado Division of Wildlife) and M. Wolowicz 
unpublished data (Big Game Harvest Statistics 1976–2012, British Columbia). Finally, wolf harvesting statistics 
were extracted from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game55–58. Again, as we did for the information on out-
door human activities, the records on large carnivore harvest were only used to support the highlighted trends 
and patterns of large carnivore attacks; thus, their sole function is to be supportive to the main text and they were 
not used in our analyses.
Data analysis. 
Considering the total dataset on large carnivore attacks since 1955, we first assessed whether 
the number of attacks varied over time, on a yearly basis, and among species by fitting a Generalized Linear Model 
(GLM) with the number of attacks against year and species (Extended Data Table 1). We also included the inter-
action term between year and species to account for the fact that the number of attacks may vary over time het-
erogeneously across species. Because our data were overdispersed, we fitted the GLM using a Negative Binomial 
distribution instead of a Poisson distribution. Next, to assess a potential change in the behavioural temperament 
of large carnivores over time, we tested whether the log-transformed age of the victim and party size (three lev-
els) varied over time and among species by fitting a linear model with a Gaussian distribution and a GLM with a 
multinomial distribution (three levels), respectively (Extended Data Tables 2 and 3). Party size was classified into 
three categories, which allows differentiating between attacks on lone individuals and groups, as well as if the vic-
tim in a group was a young person: i) the victim was alone; ii) the victim was a young person (< 
16 years old) in a 
group of adults (2 or more people); and iii) the victim was an adult (> 
16 years old) in a group of adults (2 or more 
people). We also considered the interaction term in these models to account for the fact that the surrogates of the 
changes in the temperament of large carnivores used may vary over time differently across species. Finally, we 
 www.nature.com/scientificreports/
7
Scientific RepoRts | 6:20552 | DOI: 10.1038/srep20552
analysed a subset of the dataset considering only those attacks occurring in the US and, together with information 
on human influx in natural areas, we tested if the number of attacks was related to the number of people involved 
in outdoor activities by building a GLM with a Gamma distribution, considering year, the number of visitors and 
their interaction term as factors in the model (Extended Data Table 4).
For each analysis, we used an information theoretic framework to rank a set of competing models based on 
AIC (Akaike’s Information Criterion [AIC]59). We used a stepwise selection procedure to create a candidate set 
of a priori competing models starting from the simplest null model (intercept only model) to the full model 
(Extended Data Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4). To select the best candidate model, we used AIC value corrected for small 
sample sizes (AICc) and Weighted AIC, which indicates the probability that the model selected is the best among 
the candidates59. Models within Δ 
AIC < 
2 were considered to have substantial empirical support59. All statisti-
cal analyses were performed using R 3.0.2 statistical software60. GLMs were run with the “lme4”61 and “nlme”62 
package.

This corrigendum aims to correct errors detected in the outputs of the Extended Data Tables from our article 
Scientific Reports 6, 20552 (2016). A mistake occurred due to a failure in the conversion of the variable “species” 
from integer to a categorical (factor) variable. We have updated the tables with ‘species’ as a factor (Extended Data 
Tables below). It is important to state that the essence of our results and conclusions do not change from those 
presented in the article.
Additionally, we took opportunity of this corrigendum to explore the variation in the group composition (party 
size) of humans that suffered large carnivore attack over time and across species. We simplified our response cat-
egorical variable ‘group composition’ into two categories, i.e., ‘victim alone’ and ‘victim in a party’ (binary coded 
variable). We conducted this analysis using a two-level categorical approach (binomial family in R) instead of 
using the previous multinomial approach. This change does not affect the results or conclusions of our analysis, 
as reported in the article, but is a simplification.
The correct Extended Data Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4 appear below as Table 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively.

Table 1. Variation in the number of large carnivore attacks on humans over time and among species.  
(1a) Comparison of the five competing models built to study variation in the number of large carnivore attacks 
on humans over time and among species (n = 231). Summary of fitted parameters is shown for the most 
parsimonious candidate model (the selected model was the one with the lowest AICc score). Competitive 
models are ranked from the lowest AICc value (best model) to the highest one. (1b) We present the same 
analysis, but removed those species showing some patterns in the residuals of 1a. It is worth mentioning that in 
both cases we obtained the same results. European brown bear is included in the intercept. Negative binomial 
distribution error was selected over a Poisson distribution error, considering the output of the function odTest 
from the “pscl” package in R, which compares the log-likelihood ratios of a Negative Binomial regression to the 
restriction of a Poisson regression (critical value of test statistic at the alpha = 0.05 level: 2.7055; Chi-Square Test 
Statistic = 10.661, P < 0.001).

Table 4.  Relationship between the yearly number of large carnivore attacks and the number of recreation

between the number of large carnivore attacks on humans and recreation visitors over time in national parks 
in the US as a surrogate of the visitation rates across the entire United States (n = 53). Summary of fitted 
parameters is shown for the most parsimonious candidate model. Competitive models are ranked from the 
lowest AICc value (best model) to the highest one. Year was not considered in this analysis because it was highly 
correlated with the number of visitors (Spearman rank correlation rs = 0.926, P < 0.001). Response variable: 
Number of attacks per year–Negative binomial distribution error. Deviance = 0.692.
