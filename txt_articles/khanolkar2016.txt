ABSTRACT
Background The aim was to investigate associations
between different measures of socioeconomic position
(SEP) and incidence of brain tumours (glioma,
meningioma and acoustic neuroma) in a nationwide
population-based cohort.
Methods We included 4 305 265 individuals born in
Sweden during 1911–1961, and residing in Sweden in
1991. Cohort members were followed from 1993 to
2010 for a first primary diagnosis of brain tumour
identified from the National Cancer Register. Poisson
regression was used to compute incidence rate ratios
(IRR) by highest education achieved, family income,
occupational group and marital status, with adjustment
for age, healthcare region of residence, and time period.
Results We identified 5735 brain tumours among men
and 7101 among women during the study period.
Highly educated men (≥3 years university education) had
increased risk of glioma (IRR 1.22, 95% CI 1.08 to
1.37) compared to men with primary education. High
income was associated with higher incidence of glioma
in men (1.14, 1.01 to 1.27). Women with ≥3 years
university education had increased risk of glioma (1.23,
1.08 to 1.40) and meningioma (1.16, 1.04 to 1.29)
compared to those with primary education. Men and
women in intermediate and higher non-manual
occupations had increased risk of glioma compared to
low manual groups. Compared to those married/
cohabiting, being single or previously married/cohabiting
was associated with decreased risk of glioma in men.
Men in non-manual occupations had ∼50% increased
risk of acoustic neuroma compared to men in low
manual occupations.
Conclusions We observed consistent associations
between higher SEP and higher risk of glioma.
Completeness of cancer registration and detection bias
are potential explanations for the findings.
INTRODUCTION
The aetiology of brain and central nervous system
tumours
remains
largely
unknown.1
Few
risk
factors have been identified and these vary by type
of brain tumour. Established risk factors include
exposure to ionising radiation1 and certain rare
genetic syndromes (such as the von Hippel-Lindau
and Li-Fraumeni syndromes, and neurofibroma-
tosis).2 While glioma is more common among
males,
meningioma
is
more
common
among
females.1 3 Additionally, incidences of some types
of brain tumour vary by ethnicity, for example,
glioma is more common among Caucasians.1 3 4 A
few previous studies have indicated that brain
tumour risk differs by socioeconomic background;
higher education, income, and occupational groups
have been associated with increased risk of low-
grade glioma, meningioma and acoustic neuroma,
although results have been conflicting.5–7 Some of
these studies used a case–control design which is
not ideal when studying potential differences in
brain tumour risk between socioeconomic groups,
as non-participation among controls is often asso-
ciated with lower socioeconomic position (SEP).5 8
A cohort study design would be more appropriate;
however, study cohorts must be sufficiently large to
allow for separate analyses of subtypes of brain
tumours which are relatively rare and have poten-
tially different aetiologies.4 5 Also, when exposure
data is collected prospectively it helps avoid recall
bias. The personal identification number unique to
each inhabitant in Sweden allows for linkage of
population-based
high-quality
national
registers
that include data from several decades, and pro-
vides a unique opportunity to address this issue.
The use of national registers in a cohort study
design will help eliminate selection bias at baseline,
thus possibly affecting the results of previous case–
control studies.
The aim was to investigate associations between
SEP and risk of different types of brain tumours
using a large population-based national cohort
based on national registers data with high com-
pleteness and validity, and with a range of socio-
economic indicators. Investigating associations with
different indicators of SEP is essential, as these
might influence brain tumour risk in different ways.
For example, education may influence recognition
of
symptoms
leading
to
earlier
medical
care
whereas certain occupations may be associated with
occupational exposure to carcinogens.
METHODS
Study population and follow-up: W
e created a
population-based closed cohort that includes all
individuals born in Sweden between 1911 and
1961,
and
registered
in
the
Swedish
Total
Population Register (TPR) as of 1 January 1991,
N=4 885 457.9
In
addition,
a
subcohort
was
restricted
to
persons
who
participated
in
the
national
census
performed
in
1990,
and
this
enabled us to also analyse an occupation-based
socioeconomic
indicator
(the
Swedish
Socioeconomic Classification (SEI)). W
e chose 1
January 1993 as start of follow-up as this is when
the Cancer Registry began using the International
Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Second

Downloaded from 
 Edition (ICD-O-2) for their primary coding of tumour site and
histology (patients who developed a brain tumour before the
start of follow-up were excluded). The youngest members of the
cohort were 32 years of age in 1993, an age when most indivi-
duals would have obtained a relatively stable SEP
. This enables
us to assess the effects of the cohort members’ SEP (as opposed
to that of their parents’ SEP) on risk of developing brain
tumours. Additionally, brain tumours are relatively rare among
younger
adults.
W
e
excluded
foreign-born
individuals
(N=536 125, as this group was ethnically heterogeneous with
relatively few cases of brain tumours), individuals with a brain
tumour diagnosis before the start of follow-up (N=5194), and
those
with
missing
data
at
baseline
(N=38 873);
thus,
4 305 265 individuals (2 116 091 males and 2 189 874 females)
were eligible to be included in the cohort and for follow-up
(figure 1). W
e used the unique personal identity numbers
assigned to all individuals in Sweden to obtain information on
all other variables through the linkage with national registers.
Cases—individuals with a first primary diagnosis of a brain
tumour during the study period, were identified using the
National Cancer Register.10 Analyses were restricted to glioma
(site C71, histology codes 9380-9481), meningioma (C70,
9530-9539) and acoustic neuroma (C72.4, 9560.0/9560.3).
Within the glioma group, separate analyses were also conducted
for glioblastoma (histology codes 9440-9443).
The study cohort was followed up to and inclusive of 31
December 2010. W
e checked the status of cohort subjects con-
tinuously during each year of the study period. W
e stopped
counting person-time of patients if they received a diagnosis of
a primary brain tumour, emigrated, died, or at the end of the
study period, which ever occurred first. Death was ascertained
by the date of death which was obtained from the Cause of
Death Register.11
Education, income and marital status
Highest education achieved, individualised disposable family
income, and marital status were obtained from the Longitudinal
Integration Database for Health Insurance and Labour Market
Studies (LISA).12 LISA contains integrated data on education,
labour market participation and sociodemographic indicators on
all individuals residing in the country aged 16 years and older,
and is updated annually. The information relates to the circum-
stances during the year or on 31 December, depending on the
type of information referred to. It is created using the total
population (which forms the basis for inclusion in this study),
education, income and tax, and immigration/emigration regis-
ters. Education was categorised into five groups: primary educa-
tion (1–9 years of compulsory education), lower secondary
education (10–11 years of education), higher secondary educa-
tion (12 years of education), lower tertiary education (<3 years
of university education) and higher tertiary education (≥3 years
of
university
education).
Individualised
disposable
family
income is an aggregate variable at the individual level that takes
into account all incomes earned in a household after taxes,
including any monetary social benefits that may have been
received, and is adjusted for family size. For analysis, disposable
income was divided into quintiles. Marital status was obtained
from LISA and was categorised into three groups: married or
cohabitating, previously married or cohabiting (but currently
single, ie, divorced or widowed) and single (ie, never registered
as married or cohabiting).
With the exception of occupation-based SEI, we used the
available data on socioeconomic indicator as registered in LISA
on 31 December in the year prior to each year of follow-up or
diagnosis with a brain tumour. If the relevant information the
year prior to observation or diagnosis was missing, we used the
previous available status.
Occupation-based SEI
Information on SEI was obtained from the Population and
Housing census. The census was administered via postal ques-
tionnaires, and residents in the country were legally obliged to
respond. SEI largely corresponds to the Erikson, Goldthorpe
and Portocarrero classification of occupations (EGP).13 SEI cate-
gorises individuals into occupational groups and is considered
to be a good socioeconomic indicator for individuals above
30 years of age.14 It takes into account specific responsibilities
and tasks associated with a particular kind of job. In the first
instance, it groups individuals as self-employed (including
farmers) and employees. The latter group is divided into
manual and non-manual employees. Based on the number of
years of education required for their specific occupations, non-
manual employees are further divided into three classes: higher
non-manual (typically requiring 6 years of education after

 compulsory schooling), intermediate non-manual (3–5 years of
education after compulsory schooling), and lower non-manual
(requiring fewer than 3 years of education after compulsory
schooling). Similarly, manual employees are subdivided into
skilled and unskilled workers. For this analysis, SEI was recate-
gorised into seven groups: higher non-manual, intermediate
non-manual, lower non-manual, self-employed, farmers, higher
manual and lower manual. Information on SEI is only recorded
for the working population, that is, until 65 years of age, and
was obtained from the 1990, 1985 or 1980 national censuses
and the latest available SEI for each individual was used in the
analysis. The census from 1990 is the last available for the
current study period. As information on SEI was missing for
16% of cohort members, analysis with SEI as the exposure vari-
able was based on 3 666 317 individuals (1 912 953 males, and
1 753 364 females).
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Poisson regression models were used to calculate incidence rate
ratios (IRR) for the three types of brain tumours described
above by the different indicators of SEP
, with adjustment for
potential confounders. The first model was adjusted for attained
age (age entered as a continuous variable with a 3rd-degree
polynomial), time (year of observation; continuous in years)
and healthcare region of residence (model 1). Additional adjust-
ment for marital status and the other socioeconomic indicators
besides the main socioeconomic exposure of interest were made
in model 2. Models with marital status as the main socio-
economic indicator were additionally adjusted for education and
income in model 2. All models were stratified by sex. Statistical
analyses were conducted using STATA V
.13 (College Station,
T
exas, USA).
As models for glioblastoma only did not differ substantially
from the results for glioma including glioblastoma, we only
report estimates for glioma in the tables.
RESULTS
The study was based on 4 305 265 individuals (2 116 091 males
with 32 350 436 person years and 2 189 174 females with
34 602 267 person years). During the follow-up period 5735
males and 7101 females developed brain tumours. In total,
48 615 individuals emigrated and were lost to follow-up, and
1 187 138 individuals died during follow-up (figure 1).
Education and risk of brain tumour
For glioma, the IRR increased with increasing level of education
in both men and women, and more consistently in men than
women. Men and women with three or more years of university
education had IRRs of 1.19 (95% CI 1.07 to 1.33) and 1.23
(1.08 to 1.40) for glioma, respectively (tables 1 and 2) com-
pared to those with primary education. Adjustment for marital
status and disposable income only slightly attenuated these esti-
mates (ie, model 2 compared to model 1) in men but not
women (tables 1 and 2). Education was not associated with risk
of meningioma in men. However, university educated women
had a slight increased risk of meningioma compared to those
with primary education. These estimates were statistically signifi-
cant only in the most highly educated group (IRR 1.16, 95% CI
1.04 to 1.29). Education was not associated with risk of acoustic
neuroma in either men or women (tables 1 and 2).
Disposable income and risk of brain tumour
Men with the highest disposable income (5th quintile) had an
increased incidence of glioma in comparison to those with the
lowest disposable income (IRR 1.14, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.27,
table 2). Adjustment for marital status and education only mar-
ginally attenuated these estimates (ie, model 2 compared to
model 1). Disposable income was not associated with risk of
meningioma or acoustic neuroma in men, and it was not asso-
ciated with risk of any type of brain tumour in women.
Occupation-based SEI and risk of brain tumour
Men in the highest occupational groups; intermediate and high
non-manual employees had significantly increased risks of
glioma compared to low manual employees, which was margin-
ally attenuated on adjustment for marital status and disposable
income (table 1). Similar to associations observed in men,
women classified as non-manual employees also had a signifi-
cantly increased risk of glioma compared to low manual
employees. For example, female high non-manual employees
had an IRR of 1.26 (95% CI 1.07 to 1.48) for glioma compared
to female low manual employees (table 2).
Occupational group was not associated with meningioma in
men, but women in occupations classified as intermediate non-
manual had an increased risk of meningioma (IRR 1.14, 95%
CI 1.04 to 1.26) compared to women in low manual occupa-
tions. Men in all three non-manual occupational groups had
increased risk of acoustic neuroma. In general, men in non-
manual occupations had ∼50% increased risk of acoustic
neuroma compared to men in low manual occupations (table 1).
W
e did not observe any association between occupational group
and acoustic neuroma in women (table 2).
Marital status and risk of brain tumour
Men who had never married or been in cohabiting relation-
ships, as well as those previously married or in cohabiting rela-
tionships, had significantly decreased IRR for glioma compared
to married/cohabiting men (table 1). In contrast, men who had
never married or been in a cohabiting relationship had an
increased risk of meningioma (IRR 1.19, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.38)
compared to married men. Marital status was not significantly
associated with risk of any type of brain tumour in women.
DISCUSSION
This large population-based cohort study revealed consistent
associations between indicators of higher SEP and increased risk
of glioma in men, and to a lesser extent in women. Unmarried
men had a significantly reduced risk of glioma, whereas for
women, the association was non-significant
(below unity).
W
omen with higher education had an increased risk for men-
ingioma compared to those with a lower education. The associ-
ation between education and meningioma was weaker in men.
Men who had never been married had an increased risk of men-
ingioma. Associations between acoustic neuroma with SEP were
less consistent. W
e found associations between higher occupa-
tional group and increased risk of acoustic neuroma for men,
but not for women. No significant associations with marital
status were observed for acoustic neuroma. In general, associa-
tions were more consistent for men than the women.
Strengths of the study include the population-based cohort
design reducing risk of selection bias, the large sample size, and
complete nationwide coverage of study exposures collected pro-
spectively
(educational
attainment,
disposable
income
and
marital status) which helped to avoid recall bias. Also, in prin-
ciple, all patients diagnosed with a brain tumour should have
equal access to the same standards of care as Sweden has a uni-
versal tax-funded healthcare system. Issues such as underdiagno-
sis or delayed diagnosis that might arise due to lack of insurance

 or affordability of healthcare in other countries is minimised in
Sweden. Using national registers linked via personal identity
numbers ensures complete follow-up of outcomes. Additionally
,
the Cancer Register benefits from mandatory reporting by the
pathologist and the attending clinician. Up to 99.3% of all brain
tumours recorded in the Cancer Register are diagnosed based on a
histological examination (surgical or biopsy). Additionally
, 0.23%
and 0.41% are diagnosed by X-ray and cytology
, respectively
.
W
eaknesses include the lack of information on lifestyle factors
that might influence the risk of brain tumour. However, there is
no or limited evidence that smoking, alcohol consumption, sed-
entary lifestyle or other lifestyle factors affect risk of brain
tumour, with the exception of a potentially lower incidence of
acoustic neuroma among smokers.15 It is possible that occupa-
tional group based on SEI could be misclassified for those indi-
viduals who changed their occupation after the information was
recorded. However, we expect this will affect only a small
number of individuals without impacting the observed estimates.
Previous studies identified higher SEP (using individual-level
and ecological-level indicators) as a risk factor for glioma,
including glioblastoma,5 16 17 which is in line with our results.
Case ascertainment is unlikely to explain the findings as glioma
(especially glioblastoma) is strongly symptomatic. This should be
more so in Sweden which has universal healthcare. Thus
patients experiencing symptoms would not be discouraged from
seeking medical intervention. However, as malignant forms of
glioma, especially glioblastoma, require invasive treatment proce-
dures, it is likely that older patients and those who seek care at a
later stage of tumour development may not undergo surgery
.10 If
this occurs in cases without surgery, reporting to the Cancer
Register will be based on clinical observation, with no confirm-
ation from histopathology. If patients from higher SEP groups
seek care earlier or are more likely to undergo surgery despite
advanced tumour development, reporting of the tumours to the
Cancer Registry may be more complete in higher SEP groups and
this might contribute to the observed associations.
Physicians, firefighters, industrial workers and farmers were
previously found to be at increased risk of glioma, but results
have been contradictory.1 18 A small Swedish study found that
men occupationally exposed to arsenic and mercury, and pos-
sibly to petroleum products had an increased risk of glioma, but
reported no consistent association with occupations resulting in
higher SEP
.18 For women, no associations with chemical expo-
sures were found, but there were indications of increased risks of
glioma in occupations requiring longer education.18 Unidentified
lifestyle factors might explain the increased risk of glioma in
people with high SEP
.18 W
e found that male farmers had an
increased risk of glioma (estimates not statistically significant),
although this cannot explain the observed associations with SEP
in our study
. The only well-established risk factor for glioma is
ionising radiation which is relatively rare, and we have no reason
to believe that people of high SEP should be more exposed to it.1
Our finding that previously married and single men have a
lower risk of glioma compared to married men is in line with
previous studies.5 Increased risk of brain tumours in married or
partnered subjects is thought to be partly due to detection bias
which may explain our results with marital status as an expos-
ure. Spouses are more likely to notice symptoms in their part-
ners such as memory loss, confusion, and personality changes,
that are commonly associated with glioma and insist on medical
help. Some hypothesise that women are more likely than men
to notice symptoms in their partners, which could explain the
lack of association between marital status and glioma in
women.6
Both case–control and population-based register studies have
reported associations between higher SEP and increased risk of
acoustic neuroma.5 6 W
e found that higher SEP groups had
higher risks for acoustic neuroma although estimates did not
always reach statistical significance, and findings were restricted
to men. Acoustic neuroma is generally slow growing and often
goes undetected for several years.19 People with higher education
and those belonging to higher occupational groups are more
likely to notice symptoms, such as unilateral hearing loss, and
more importantly, seek medical care earlier than those with
lower education (contributing to detection bias). While this may
explain the observed increased risk of acoustic neuroma in higher
SEP men, it cannot explain the less consistent associations
observed between SEP and risk of acoustic neuroma in women.
Also, the incidence of acoustic neuroma is similar in both sexes.
Detection and reporting of a benign slow growing tumour like
acoustic neuroma to the cancer registry is likely to be less com-
plete, especially as watchful waiting is often the first choice of
treatment, delaying a histological confirmation of the diagnosis.
Previous studies of SEP and meningioma have reported incon-
sistent results and data are scarce, especially for women.5 8 18
Some occupations, such as university teachers, social workers,
managing directors and toolworkers, were shown to be asso-
ciated with increased risk of meningioma in men. However, we
did not observe any association between SEP and meningioma
in men in this study and we are unable to provide an explan-
ation for the same. W
e found some indication that higher SEP
women, especially women with higher education, may be at
higher risk of meningioma, but no corresponding association
for men. A previous Swedish study found that women in occu-
pations as teachers, bookkeepers, cashiers and store workers had
higher risk of meningioma.18 These occupations would be classi-
fied as intermediate non-manual, which is the group of women
found to have an increased risk of meningioma in our study
.
However, none of these occupations are considered to be associated
with potential carcinogens that could explain the observed increased
risk. Meningioma is also generally a slower growing benign tumour
where earlier recognition of symptoms in higher socioeconomic
groups could result in some detection bias. This could potentially
explain the higher incidence in women with higher education.
Hormonal and reproductive differences between the two sexes
could also potentially explain the difference in incidence of men-
ingioma and glioma between men and women.18 20 21
Conclusions
W
e found that higher SEP was associated with an increased risk
of glioma in Swedish men and women, and to a lesser extent
with acoustic neuroma in men and meningioma in women.
Completeness of cancer registration and detection bias are
potential explanations for the differences, although we had
expected these sources of bias to primarily affect results for
meningioma and acoustic neuroma.
What is already known on this subject?
▸ Indicators of socioeconomic position like higher education,
income and occupational group are associated with
increased risk of brain tumour (low-grade glioma,
meningioma and acoustic neuroma). Results from previous
studies are conflicting and might be biased due to study
design.

 What this study adds
▸ Using a large population-based cohort, this study found
consistent associations between indicators of higher
socioeconomic position and increased risk of glioma in both
sexes, and to a much lesser extent in meningioma and
acoustic neuroma. Completeness of cancer registration and
detection bias are potential explanations for the observed
differences by socioeconomic position.
