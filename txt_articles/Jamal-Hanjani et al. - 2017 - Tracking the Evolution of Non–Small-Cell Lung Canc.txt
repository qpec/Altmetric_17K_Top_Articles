BACKGROUND
Among patients with non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), data on intratumor heterogeneity 
and cancer genome evolution have been limited to small retrospective cohorts. We wanted 
to prospectively investigate intratumor heterogeneity in relation to clinical outcome and to 
determine the clonal nature of driver events and evolutionary processes in early-stage NSCLC.
METHODS
In this prospective cohort study, we performed multiregion whole-exome sequencing on 
100 early-stage NSCLC tumors that had been resected before systemic therapy. We sequenced 
and analyzed 327 tumor regions to define evolutionary histories, obtain a census of clonal 
and subclonal events, and assess the relationship between intratumor heterogeneity and 
recurrence-free survival.
RESULTS
We observed widespread intratumor heterogeneity for both somatic copy-number altera-
tions and mutations. Driver mutations in EGFR, MET, BRAF, and TP53 were almost always 
clonal. However, heterogeneous driver alterations that occurred later in evolution were 
found in more than 75% of the tumors and were common in PIK3CA and NF1 and in genes 
that are involved in chromatin modification and DNA damage response and repair. 
Genome doubling and ongoing dynamic chromosomal instability were associated with 
intratumor heterogeneity and resulted in parallel evolution of driver somatic copy-number 
alterations, including amplifications in CDK4, FOXA1, and BCL11A. Elevated copy-number 
heterogeneity was associated with an increased risk of recurrence or death (hazard ratio, 
4.9; P 
= 
4.4×10−4), which remained significant in multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS
Intratumor heterogeneity mediated through chromosome instability was associated with 
an increased risk of recurrence or death, a finding that supports the potential value of 
chromosome instability as a prognostic predictor. (Funded by Cancer Research UK and

L
ung cancer is the leading cause of 
cancer-related death worldwide,1,2 with non–
small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) being the 
most common type. Large-scale sequencing stud-
ies have revealed the complex genomic landscape 
of NSCLC3-6 and genomic differences between lung 
adenocarcinomas and lung squamous-cell carcino-
mas.7 However, in-depth exploration of NSCLC 
intratumor heterogeneity (which provides the fuel 
for tumor evolution and drug resistance) and can-
cer genome evolution has been limited to small 
retrospective cohorts.8,9 Therefore, the clinical 
significance of intratumor heterogeneity and the 
potential for clonality of driver events to guide 
therapeutic strategies have not yet been defined.
Tracking Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer Evolu-
tion through Therapy (TRACERx)10 is a multi-
center, prospective cohort study, which began 
recruitment in April 2014 with funding from 
Cancer Research UK. The target enrollment is 
842 patients from whom samples will be obtained 
for high-depth, multiregion whole-exome se-
quencing of surgically resected NSCLC tumors in 
stages IA through IIIA. One primary objective of 
TRACERx is to investigate the hypothesis that in-
tratumor heterogeneity — in terms of mutations 
(single or dinucleotide base substitutions or small 
insertions and deletions) or somatic copy-number 
alterations (reflecting gains or losses of chromo-
some segments) — is associated with clinical 
outcome. Here, we report on the first 100 patients 
who were prospectively recruited in the study.
Methods
Patients and Tumor Samples
We collected tumor samples from 100 patients 
with NSCLC who had not received previous sys-
temic therapy (Fig. 1A; and Fig. S1 in Supplemen-
tary Appendix 1, available with the full text of 
this article at NEJM.org). Identifiers of patients 
were reassigned to protect anonymity and were 
ordered according to intratumor heterogeneity 
and histologic subtype. Eligible patients were at 
least 18 years of age and had received a diagno-
sis of NSCLC in stages IA through IIIA (except 
Patient CRUK0035, whose tumor was classified 
as stage IIIB on the basis of postoperative histo-
logic analysis). The cohort was representative of 
a population of patients with NSCLC who were 
eligible for curative resection. Histologic data 
were confirmed on central review by a lung pa-
thologist. (Details regarding the study design are 
provided in the protocol, available at NEJM.org.)
To assess intratumor heterogeneity, samples 
of at least two tumor regions that were separated 
by a margin of 0.3 cm to 1 cm (depending on the 
size of the tumor) had to be available for study. 
None of the tumors carried a translocation in 
ALK, ROS1, or RET on the basis of sequencing. 
This finding was confirmed for ALK and ROS1 
with the use of immunohistochemical testing. 
All the patients provided written informed con-
sent. The clinical characteristics of the patients 
and the study criteria are provided in Tables S1 
and S2 and in the Experimental Procedures sec-
tion in Supplementary Appendix 1.
Multiregion Whole-Exome Sequencing
We used the Illumina HiSeq to perform whole-
exome sequencing on multiple regions collected 
from each tumor. We sequenced 327 tumor re-
gions (323 primary tumor regions and 4 lymph-
node metastases) and 100 matched germline sam-
ples derived from whole blood (median number, 
3 regions per tumor; range, 2 to 8), to a median 
depth of 426× (Table S3 in Supplementary Ap-
pendix 1). Orthogonal validation was performed 
(Table S4 and Fig. S2 in Supplementary Appen-
dix 1). All sequencing data have been deposited 
in the European Genome–Phenome Archive under 
accession number EGAS00001002247.

tion. We performed multiregion whole-exome 
sequencing on 100 TRACERx tumors and classi-
fied somatic mutations, which were defined as 
coding and noncoding single-nucleotide variants, 
and copy-number alterations, which were measured 
as a percentage of the genome affected by such 
alterations, as clonal (present in all cancer cells) 
or subclonal (present in a subset of cancer 
cells) (Fig. 1).
We observed extensive intratumor heteroge-
neity, with a median of 30% (range, 0.5 to 93) of 
somatic mutations identified as subclonal and a 
median of 48% (range, 0.3 to 88) of copy-number 
alterations as subclonal (Fig. 2A, and Fig. S3 in 
Supplementary Appendix 1). This finding sug-
gests that genomic-instability processes at the 
mutational and chromosomal level are ongoing 
during tumor development. Considerable varia-
tion in intratumor heterogeneity among tumors 
was also observed, with the number of subclonal 
mutations ranging from 2 to 2310 and the per-
centage of the genome affected by subclonal copy-
number alterations ranging from 0.06 to 81% 
(Fig. 2A). Without multiregion whole-exome se-
quencing, 76% of subclonal mutations could have 
appeared to be clonal, which suggests the selec-
tion of subclones within individual tumor regions 
(Fig. S4 in Supplementary Appendix 1). Signifi-
cantly more mutations were identified with the 
use of multiregion whole-exome sequencing than 
with single-sample analysis (median number, 517 
vs. 398; P 
= 
0.009) or with the use of single NSCLC 
samples obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas 
(median number, 207; P<0.001) (Fig. S5 in Supple-
mentary Appendix 1). The Cancer Genome Atlas 
research network (http://cancergenome 
.

was retrieved through dbGaP authorization acces-
sion number phs000178.v9.p8.
Squamous-cell carcinomas carried significant-
ly more clonal mutations than did adenocarcino-
mas (P 
= 
0.003) (Fig. S6 in Supplementary Ap-
pendix 1). This finding potentially reflects 
differences in smoking history, with a median of 
32 pack-years for adenocarcinomas and 41 pack-
years for squamous-cell carcinomas (P 
= 
0.047) 
(Fig. S7 in Supplementary Appendix 1). There were 
no significant differences between squamous-cell 
carcinomas and adenocarcinomas in the number 
or proportion of subclonal mutations (P 
= 
0.72) 
(Fig. S6 in Supplementary Appendix 1) or within 
specific adenocarcinoma histopathological sub-
types (Fig. S8 in Supplementary Appendix 1). In 
squamous-cell carcinomas, no significant rela-
tionship was observed between intratumor hetero-
geneity and clinical variables (Table S5 in Sup-
plementary Appendix 1).
In adenocarcinomas, tumor stage positively 
correlated with the proportion of subclonal copy-
number alterations, and Ki67 staining positively 
correlated with the burden of both clonal and 
subclonal mutations, as well as with the propor-
tion of subclonal copy-number alterations (Table 
S5 in Supplementary Appendix 1). Furthermore, 
in adenocarcinomas, a significantly higher clonal 
and subclonal mutational burden was observed 
in smokers than in patients who had never smoked 
(Fig. S9 in Supplementary Appendix 1).
There was no significant association between 
the proportion of subclonal mutations (median in 
the cohort, 30%) and relapse-free survival (Fig. 
2B). However, in this preliminary analysis, patients 
who had tumors with a high proportion of sub-
clonal copy-number alterations (≥48%, the co-
hort median) were at higher risk for recurrence 
or death than those with a low proportion (haz-
ard ratio, 4.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8 to 
13.1; P 
= 
4.4×10−4) (Fig. 2C). The median time 
until recurrence or death was 24.4 months in the 
higher risk group of patients compared with a 
median that was not reached in the lower risk 
group. This finding remained significant in a 
multivariate analysis after adjustment for age, 
pack-years of smoking, histologic subtype, adju-
Figure 2 (facing page). Genomic Heterogeneity  
of Tumors Obtained from Patients with Non–Small- 
Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).
Panel A shows the number of coding and noncoding 
mutations that were detected in each tumor region in 
the study, according to tumor stage, smoking history, 
outcome of recurrence or death, and number of regions 
affected. The percentages of somatic mutations and 
copy-number alterations that were found to be clonal 
or subclonal in each tumor are shown below the num-
ber of mutations. The percentages of study patients 
who were disease-free over a 30-month period are 
shown according to whether the patients had a high 
proportion (above the median) or a low proportion 
(below the median) of subclonal mutations (Panel B) 
or of subclonal copy-number alterations (Panel C). 
There was no significant association between the pro-
portion of subclonal mutations and relapse-free sur-
vival (P = 0.70), but patients who had tumors with a 
high proportion of subclonal copy-number alterations 
were at significantly higher risk for recurrence or death 
than those with a low proportion (P = 4.4×10−4).

Evolutionary Histories and Tumor Clonal 
Architecture in NSCLC
The number or proportion of subclonal muta-
tions does not fully capture the extent of intra-
tumor heterogeneity, since these measures do not 
reflect the number or prevalence of genetically 
distinct subclones that evolve in space and time. 
To elucidate subclones within regions and map 
the evolutionary history of each tumor, we clus-
tered mutations according to their cellular prev-
alence. Each cluster represents a node on the 
phylogenetic tree of the tumor and a subclone 
that is present in the tumor population or has 
existed during its evolutionary history (Table S7, 
Figs. S11 and S12, and the Experimental Proce-
dures section in Supplementary Appendix 1).
We identified 525 mutation clusters, with a 
median of 5 per tumor (range, 2 to 15). Most 
tumor regions (86%) were found to carry sub-
clones from only a single branch of the phyloge-
netic tree, which emphasizes the limitations of 
a single diagnostic biopsy sample in accurately 
capturing the true extent of intratumor hetero-
geneity. Without the use of multiregion whole-
exome sequencing, 65% of branched subclone 
clusters could have erroneously appeared to be 
clonal.
Causes of Intratumor Heterogeneity in NSCLC
Mutational Processes
Understanding how mutational processes shape 
tumor evolution may inform strategies to limit 
tumor adaptation in the clinical setting.11 Using 
published mutational signatures,12 we analyzed 
clonal and subclonal mutations to determine 
which mutational processes contributed to intra-
tumor heterogeneity.
The number of early mutations (accumulated 
before genome doubling or copy-number change) 
significantly correlated with the burden of muta-
tions associated with smoking (mutational sig-
nature 4), with Spearman’s rank correlations of 
0.90 (P<1.1×10−16) for adenocarcinomas and of 
0.84 (P 
= 
3.9×10−9) for squamous-cell carcinomas. 
This finding was consistent with the identifica-
tion of mutations induced by tobacco carcino-
gens as being a key influence on trunk length 
(i.e., the number of mutations found in the most 
recent common ancestor of all cancer cells) and 
was reflected in the significant correlation be-
tween pack-years and truncal signature 4 muta-
tions in adenocarcinomas (Spearman’s rank cor-
relation, 0.63; P 
= 
5.3×10−8). In samples obtained 
from 7 of 12 patients with adenocarcinomas who 
were long-term former smokers (with >20 years 
since last tobacco exposure), a smoking signa-
ture could be detected in late clonal mutations 
(>30% with signature 4). This finding was sug-
gestive of a long period of tumor latency in the 
evolution of lung adenocarcinomas before clini-
cal presentation.
In squamous-cell carcinomas, no significant 
correlation was observed between pack-years and 
smoking-related signature 4 (Spearman’s rank 
correlation, 0.10; P 
= 
0.57), and the timing of 
genome doubling (ratio of the number of early 
mutations to the number of late mutations) was 
significantly later than in adenocarcinomas (Fig. 
S13 in Supplementary Appendix 1). Intriguingly, 
Patient CRUK0093, who had squamous-cell car-
cinoma, had a large burden of clonal signature 
4 mutations (>1000) despite having been identi-
fied as a lifelong nonsmoker. This patient’s oc-
cupational history indicated exposure to chemicals 
that included arsenic, benzene, bisphenol, and 
polybrominated diphenyl ethers and coal tar, 
which may mimic the mutagenic effects of to-
bacco exposure.
There were significant correlations between 
the subclonal mutation burden and the number 
of subclonal mutations that were classified as 
clocklike signatures 1A (spontaneous deamina-
tion of methylated cytosines) and 5 (of unknown 
cause).13 The number of subclonal mutations was 
also significantly correlated with signatures 2 and 
13 (induced by APOBEC, a family of cytidine 
deaminase enzymes involved in messenger RNA 
editing) but not with signature 4 (smoking)12 (Fig. 
S14 in Supplementary Appendix 1). (APOBEC cy-
tidine deaminases, which are usually involved in 
innate immunity and RNA editing, have been 
found to be enriched in several tumor types and 
act as an important source of mutagenesis.14) 
Tumors with the largest subclonal mutation bur-
den had extensive APOBEC-mediated mutagene-
sis (e.g., those obtained from Patients CRUK0001, 
CRUK0006, CRUK0020, and CRUK0063), and 
spatial heterogeneity in APOBEC mutations was 
observed in 15 tumors (Figs. S11 and S14 in

Supplementary Appendix 1). Tumors obtained 
from 19 patients had subclonal driver mutations 
that could be attributed to APOBEC activity, 
which illustrates how APOBEC mutagenesis may 
frequently induce a subclonal driver event that 
may contribute to subclonal expansions.
Chromosomal Instability and Genome Doubling
Given the association between intratumor hetero-
geneity characterized by copy-number alterations 
and shorter relapse-free survival, we further ex-
plored the dynamics of chromosomal alterations 
in different tumor regions and the extent to 
which chromosomal instability may drive intra-
tumor heterogeneity. By leveraging germline 
heterozygous single-nucleotide polymorphisms 
in tumors by means of multiregion whole-exome 
sequencing, it is possible to determine whether 
the same or distinct parental alleles are gained or 
lost in distinct subclones on different branches 
of the phylogenetic tree of a tumor. Specifically, 
if the maternal allele is gained or lost in a sub-
clone in one region, yet the paternal allele is 
gained or lost in a different subclone in another 
region, it will result in a mirrored subclonal al-
lelic imbalance profile (Fig. 3A and 3B). Such an 
imbalance, which indicates additional ongoing 
chromosomal instability, may also reflect parallel 
Figure 3. Drivers of Intratumor Heterogeneity.
Panel A shows an example of mirrored subclonal allelic imbalance. This occurs when the maternal allele is gained or lost in a subclone in 
one region and the paternal allele is gained or lost in a different subclone in another region. Such imbalance indicates additional ongoing 
chromosomal instability and can be inferred through multiregion whole-exome sequencing by using the frequencies at which heterozy-
gous germline single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (termed B-allele frequency [BAF]) are detected. The BAF of heterozygous SNPs 
is plotted in the same color as their parental chromosome of origin. Panel B shows the BAF profile across the genome of a tumor sample 
obtained from Patient CRUK0062. Areas of BAF in regions (including tumor regions R1 through R7 and a germline [GL] reference region) 
that have mirrored subclonal allelic imbalance are highlighted in blue or orange. Events that showed mirrored subclonal allelic imbalance 
were identified in more than 40% of the genome. Panel C shows phylogenetic trees that indicate parallel evolution of driver amplifica-
tions detected through the observation of mirrored subclonal allelic imbalance (arrows). Subclones that are colored blue carry a cancer 
driver event, and those that are colored gray carry no driver event; black outlining of the circles indicates that the subclone appears to be 
clonal in at least one tumor region.

evolution involving multiple distinct events con-
verging on the same genes in different subclones 
(Fig. S15 in Supplementary Appendix 1). This 
phenomenon was observed in 62% of 92 tumors 
with copy-number data on multiregion whole-
exome sequencing (found in 30 adenocarcino-
mas, 23 squamous-cell carcinomas, and 4 other 
samples). In total, we detected 375 mirrored 
subclonal allelic imbalance events that varied in 
size from focal to whole chromosome and in-
volved 1 to 43% of affected tumor genomes (Fig. 
S16 in Supplementary Appendix 1).
Chromosomal instability may also directly con-
tribute to mutational heterogeneity through loss 
of genomic segments carrying clonal mutations. 
Overall, a median of 13% of subclonal mutations 
(range, 0 to 56) per sample are probably sub-
clonal as a result of loss events associated with 
copy-number alterations, which suggests that 
chromosomal instability may be an initiator of 
both copy-number and mutational heterogeneity 
(Fig. S17 in Supplementary Appendix 1).
Accumulating evidence suggests that genome-
doubling events are associated with the propaga-
tion of chromosomal instability by cancer cells 
and may predict a poor prognosis.15-17 Genome-
doubling events were identified in 76% of tumors 
and appeared to be clonal in all but three of 
these 
tumors 
(from 
Patients 
CRUK0011, 
CRUK0062, 
and CRUK0063), which suggests that whole-
genome duplication is an early event in NSCLC 
evolution. In adenocarcinomas, we observed a 
significant association between genome doubling 
and the frequency of both subclonal mutations 
(P 
= 
0.02) and subclonal copy-number alterations 
(P 
= 
0.003) (Fig. S18 in Supplementary Appendix 1). 
Moreover, mirrored subclonal allelic imbalance 
was significantly enriched in genome-doubled 
tumors (P 
= 
0.004 by Fisher’s exact test) (Fig. S16 
in Supplementary Appendix 1).
Selection and Parallel Evolution
Deciphering evidence of ongoing selection in tu-
mors may shed light on evolutionary constraints, 
which may identify therapeutic targets. Con-
straints and selection are exemplified by the oc-
currence of parallel evolution, in which somatic 
events in distinct branches within a single tumor 
converge on the same gene, protein complex, or 
pathway.
No evidence of parallel evolution was found 
at the mutational level. However, focal amplifi-
cations of different parental alleles in distinct 
subclones occurred in 5 tumors and affected 
known cancer genes, including MUC1, CDK4, 
CHD8, and NKX2-1 (Fig. 3C, and Fig. S19 in Sup-
plementary Appendix 1). At the chromosome-arm 
level, potential parallel evolution was observed in 
13 tumors (5 adenocarcinomas, 6 squamous-cell 
carcinomas, and 2 other tumors). Most parallel 
evolution of chromosome-arm gains (in 10 of 11 
samples) and losses (in 6 of 8 samples) have 
been previously classified as significantly gained 
or lost in NSCLC,3,7 a finding that is consistent 
with positive selection operating later in tumor 
evolution (Fig. S20, S21, and S22 in Supplemen-
tary Appendix 1).
To empirically estimate positive selection at 
the mutational level, we used a ratio of substitu-
tion rates at nonsynonymous sites to those at 
synonymous sites (dN/dS) that accounts for the 
trinucleotide context of each mutation and de-
termines whether there is an enrichment of 
protein-altering mutations as compared with the 
background mutation rate.18 Evidence for positive 
selection (dN/dS, >1) was observed when all exonic 
missense mutations were considered (Table S8 
in Supplementary Appendix 1). This finding sug-
gests that mutations may be shaped by selection 
in NSCLC. However, when mutations were tem-
porally dissected, significant positive selection 
was observed for late, but not early, mutations. 
Consistent with this finding, nonsense mutations 
were found to be depleted (dN/dS, <1) early but 
not late in tumor development. These data fur-
ther suggest that selection is persistent in NSCLC 
evolution and that constraints shape evolution-
ary trajectories. Depletion of early nonsense mu-
tations (dN/dS, <1) was greater in squamous-cell 
carcinomas than in adenocarcinomas, and the 
rate of acquisition of clonal driver mutations (as 
determined by the ratio of driver mutations to 
passenger mutations) was significantly greater 
in adenocarcinomas than in squamous-cell car-
cinomas (P 
= 
0.001 by the Wilcoxon test).
Clonal and Subclonal Driver Alterations  
and Timing of Genomic Events
Determining whether a cancer driver event oc-
curs early or late can indicate whether it is in-
volved in tumor initiation or maintenance, and 
its clonality may inform potential therapeutic

strategies, since subclonal alterations will be 
present in only a proportion of cells and when 
targeted may result in reduced treatment effi-
cacy.19 We identified 795 driver events (range in 
adenocarcinomas, 1 to 19; range in squamous-
cell carcinomas, 2 to 21). Of these events, 219 in 
77 tumors were found to be subclonal (range in 
adenocarcinomas, 0 to 10; range in squamous-
cell carcinomas, 0 to 12) and 576 to be clonal 
(range in adenocarcinomas, 1 to 18; range in 
squamous-cell carcinomas, 1 to 14) (Fig. S23 in 
Supplementary Appendix 1 and Table S9 in Sup-
plementary Appendix 2). Significantly more driver 
alterations were identified with the use of multi-
region whole-exome sequencing than with single-
sample analysis (P 
= 
0.004 by the Wilcoxon test) 
(Fig. S24 in Supplementary Appendix 1).
Alterations in certain cancer genes were not 
only primarily clonal but almost always occurred 
before genome duplication, which suggests in-
volvement in tumor initiation (Fig. 4). In adeno-
carcinomas, these alterations included targeta-
ble mutations or amplifications in EGFR, MET, and 
BRAF, as well as amplifications in TERT, 8p loss, 
and 5p gain. In squamous-cell carcinomas, muta-
tions in NOTCH1, amplifications in FGFR1 and in 
the 3q region (which includes SOX2 and PIK3CA), 
and loss of 3p, 4p, 5q, and 17p were early clonal 
events. Mutations in TP53 were predominantly 
clonal and early for both subtypes. Conversely, 
other driver events, including mutations in KMT2C 
and COL5A2 in adenocarcinomas and in PIK3CA 
in squamous-cell carcinomas, while predomi-
nantly clonal, often occurred after genome du-
plication, which suggests their involvement in 
tumor maintenance or progression. Except for 
alterations in TP53, ATM, CHEK2, and MDM2, 
51% of 72 driver alterations affecting chromatin 
remodeling, histone methylation, or DNA dam-
age response and repair were subclonal or late in 
both histologic subtypes (23 of 41 events in ad-
enocarcinomas and 14 of 31 events in squamous-
cell carcinomas) (Fig. S25 in Supplementary 
Appendix 1). UBR5, with a known role in dif-
ferentiation and DNA damage response, was one 
of the most frequently altered genes later in evolu-
tion in both adenocarcinomas and squamous-cell 
carcinomas. Other genes that were subject to 
frequent subclonal or late alterations in adeno-
carcinomas included NF1 and NOTCH1, along 
with 3p, 13q, and 21p loss and 7q and 8q gain, 
whereas in squamous-cell carcinomas, alterations 
in MLH1 and KRAS, along with 10q loss and 7p, 
8q, and 20q gain, were late events.
Driver mutations that occurred early showed 
a significantly greater tendency to occur in estab-
lished histologic-subtype–specific cancer genes 
than did late or subclonal driver mutations, 
which affected a broader selection of pan-cancer 
genes20 (Fig. S26 in Supplementary Appendix 1). 
These data are consistent with the dN/dS muta-
tion-selection analysis and suggest that constraints 
inherent in cancer evolution vary as tumors de-
velop, which potentially renders more evolution-
ary paths permissive for progression.
Overall, 86 of the 100 tumors in our study 
had alterations that are being investigated in 
NSCLC in genomically profiled drug studies, in-
cluding the National Lung Matrix Trial (NLMT)21 
and the Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice 
(MATCH) trial.22 Of these 86 tumors, 17 (20%) 
had subclonal targetable mutations and copy-
number alterations. In 12 of these 17 tumors 
(71%), both a clonal and a subclonal targetable 
alteration were present, which indicates how tar-
gets might be prioritized for therapeutic inter-
vention (Fig. S27 in Supplementary Appendix 1).
Discussion
Intratumor heterogeneity provides the fuel for 
tumor evolution and drug resistance.23 Here, we 
have provided an analysis of NSCLC evolution, 
which has shown that intratumor heterogeneity 
and branched evolution are almost universal 
across the cohort. We also observed a common 
pattern of early clonal genome doubling, followed 
by extensive subclonal diversification.
These data may have important implications 
for our understanding of tumor biology and 
therapeutic control in NSCLC. Certain targetable 
driver mutations, including those in EGFR, MET, 
and BRAF, were almost exclusively clonal and 
early, which explains the robust and uniform 
responses that are often seen across multiple 
sites of disease when these alterations are tar-
geted.24-26 However, more than 75% of the tumors 
in our study carried a subclonal driver alteration, 
including in genes such as PIK3CA, NF1, KRAS, 
TP53, and NOTCH family members. Moreover, a 
large fraction of subclonal driver mutations ap-
peared to be clonal in a single region but were

Tracking the Evolution of Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer
absent or subclonal in other regions, which con-
firmed the limitations of sampling single tumor 
regions and emphasized the ability of multi-
region whole-exome sequencing to define the 
clonality of driver events for prioritization of 
drug targets.
Late mutations in tumor-suppressor genes that 
occur after genome doubling often affected only 
one allele, which potentially left the wild-type 
alleles intact. Although this finding could indi-
cate that late tumor-suppressor mutations are 
often passenger events that do not contribute to 
tumor progression, it is also plausible that germ-
line defects, subclonal copy-number loss, haplo-
insufficiency, or transcriptional regulation may 
act to limit wild-type expression. In contrast to 
early mutations, late driver mutations were not 
specific to the NSCLC subtype and often occurred 
in cancer genes that have been identified in 
other tumor types; a high proportion occurred 
in genes that are involved in the maintenance of 
genome integrity through DNA damage response 
and repair, chromatin remodeling, and histone 
methylation. Such mutations may remove tissue-
specific constraints on the cancer genome and 
provide advantages to emerging subclones later 
in evolution. However, the observation of paral-
lel evolution of driver copy-number alterations 
that were identified through mirrored subclonal 
allelic imbalance, including in CDK4, FOXA1, and 
BCL11A, suggests that despite extensive diversity, 
specific constraints, which could be therapeuti-
cally exploited, may operate later in tumor evo-
lution.
Tumors with the highest subclonal mutational 
burden had extensive APOBEC-mediated muta-
genesis, and 19 tumors carried subclonal driver 
mutations within an APOBEC context. This find-
ing suggests that targeting the enzymatic activ-
ity of APOBEC may provide a means of limiting 
subclone diversification. The clonal mutation 
burden was significantly enriched in patients 
with a smoking history. Conceivably, this find-
ing could be exploited for therapeutic benefit 
through the use of peptide vaccines or adoptive 
cell therapy against clonal neoantigens that are 
present in every tumor cell. However, the obser-
vation that clonal mutations can be lost owing to 
later copy-number events could limit the efficacy 
of such strategies, especially in tumors with high 
chromosome instability.
Finally, although a single sample can provide 
a static measure of chromosomal complexity,27 
the use of multiregion whole-exome sequencing 
enables the assessment of dynamic chromosome 
instability, which may lead to differences in chro-
mosomal karyotypes between NSCLC subclones. 
The onset of chromosome instability appears to 
have a considerable effect on the evolution of 
NSCLC; such instability appears to be the pre-
dominant driver of parallel evolution and can 
lead to both mutational and copy-number diver-
sity among subclones. Elevated copy-number het-
erogeneity was associated with shorter relapse-
free survival, which suggests that patients who 
have early-stage tumors with high levels of copy-
number heterogeneity may represent a high-risk 
group who may benefit from close monitoring 
and early therapeutic intervention during follow-
up. We are continuing to assess this association 
in the next 742 patients enrolled in TRACERx. 
Whether noninvasive prognostic approaches, such 
as liquid biopsy, can be used to prospectively 
assess the levels of chromosomal instability in 
the clinical setting warrants further attention.28 
In addition to ongoing efforts to target single 
genetic alterations, there is a need to develop a 
greater understanding of chromosomal instabil-
ity, which can alter the copy number of a multi-
tude of genes simultaneously. Indeed, therapeu-
tic efforts that can attenuate this process may 
limit the ensuing heterogeneity and tumor evolu-
tion that drive poor rates of relapse-free survival. 
In the analysis presented here, we provide a 
Figure 4 (facing page). Timing of Somatic Events  
in NSCLC Evolution.
A diagram of tumor evolution in adenocarcinoma 
(Panel A) and squamous-cell carcinoma (Panel B) 
shows the approximate timing of genomic aberrations 
with respect to the cancer life history. The timing of 
mutations and copy-number events is shown as bars 
indicating whether the events are clonal or subclonal. 
Clonal mutations and chromosome-arm events are fur-
ther timed as early or late with respect to genome dou-
bling (GD). The frequency of mutations and copy-num-
ber alterations (subclonal and total) is indicated on the 
right side of the bars. Pie charts show the fraction of 
estimated mutations for each signature, averaged 
across current smokers or recent ex-smokers (CS), 
long-term (>20 years) former smokers (ES), and life-
long never smokers (NS) at three different time points. 
Only genes that were mutated in at least two patients 
or that had copy-number alterations in at least 20% of 
the patients in the cohort are shown.
