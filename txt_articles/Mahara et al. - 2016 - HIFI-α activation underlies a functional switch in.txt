Despite the established oncogenic function of Polycomb repressive
complex 2 (PRC2) in human cancers, its role as a tumor suppressor
is also evident; however, the mechanism underlying the regulation
of the paradoxical functions of PRC2 in tumorigenesis is poorly
understood. Here we show that hypoxia-inducible factor 1, α-subunit
(HIFI-α) is a crucial modulator of PRC2 and enhancer of zeste 2 (EZH2)
function in breast cancer. Interrogating the genomic expression of
breast cancer indicates high HIF1A activity correlated with high EZH2
expression but low PRC2 activity in triple-negative breast cancer
compared with other cancer subtypes. In the absence of HIFIA acti-
vation, PRC2 represses the expression of matrix metalloproteinase
genes (MMPs) and invasion, whereas a discrete Ezh2 complexed with
Forkhead box M1 (FoxM1) acts to promote the expression of MMPs.
HIF1-α induction upon hypoxia results in PRC2 inactivation by selec-
tive suppression of the expression of suppressor of zeste 12 protein
homolog (SUZ12) and embryonic ectoderm development (EED), lead-
ing to a functional switch toward Ezh2/FoxM1-dependent induc-
tion of the expression of MMPs and invasion. Our study suggests a
tumor-suppressive function of PRC2, which is restricted by HIF1-α,
and an oncogenic function of Ezh2, which cooperates with FoxM1
to promote invasion in triple-negative breast cancer.

reast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with diverse mor-
phological features, molecular signaling, metastasis patterns,
and clinical outcomes. Global gene-expression analyses attempting
to deconstruct the biological heterogeneity in breast cancer have
identified four distinct molecular intrinsic subtypes: luminal A,
luminal B, HER2+ (human EGF receptor 2+), and basal-like (1–3).
The defining factor underlying the biological heterogeneity of
these breast cancer subtypes appears to be the subtype-specific
transcriptional program (1, 4), emphasizing the distinct oncogenic
driver events that may account for their differences in clinical
behavior, with certain subtypes demonstrating better survival
outcome than others (5). Among these breast cancer subtypes,
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is defined by the
lack of estrogen, progesterone, and Her2 receptors and is closely
related to the basal-like subtype, is highly aggressive and has the
worst clinical outcome (2, 3, 5).
The histone methyltransferase Ezh2 (enhancer of zeste 2) is
the catalytic subunit of PRC2 (Polycomb repressive complex 2),
which facilitates repression of its target genes via trimethylation
of lysine residue 27 on histone 3 (H3K27me3) (6). In multiple
malignancies including breast cancer, the up-regulation of Ezh2
is positively correlated with tumor grade, metastasis propensity,
and poor survival rate (7). The oncogenic function of Ezh2 has
been linked to both PRC2-dependent and PRC2-independent ac-
tivities (8–13). Paradoxically, a context-dependent tumor-suppressive
function of Ezh2 or PRC2 also has been reported in several
malignancies (14–18). Moreover, high-grade breast, ovarian, and
pancreatic cancers have been found to harbor low global H3K27me3,
which is correlated with increased recurrence and poor survival
(19–21). Particularly in breast cancer, EZH2 and H3K27me3 levels
are found to be not correlated across different subtypes, with
higher expression of EZH2 in basal-like/TNBC and HER2+ tu-
mors, and high H3K27me3 level in luminal A, luminal B, and
normal-like tumors (19, 22). Consequently, a high EZH2 ex-
pression is associated with poor disease outcome (19, 20, 23),
and a high H3K27me3 level is associated with better outcome
(19, 20, 22). Thus, the oncogenic function of Ezh2 in TNBC is
not well coupled with the H3K27me3 level; instead, it might be
more connected to its nonepigenetic silencing effect. Indeed,
discrete functions of Ezh2, independent of PRC2, have been found
to regulate NF-κB (8) and Notch pathways positively in TNBC
(13). Furthermore, the inverse correlation between EZH2 and
H3K27me3 levels seen in TNBC seems to indicate an impaired
PRC2 activity in TNBC. Consistent with the clinical observation,
a recent study has shown that deficient Ezh2/PRC2 activity is
essential for TNBC tumorigenesis (17). Despite these findings in
breast cancer, particularly in TNBC, the mechanism underlying the
regulation of Ezh2 in relation to PRC2 activity or non-PRC2 ac-
tivity is poorly understood.
In this study, we sought to address this gap in knowledge. By
interrogating the transcriptional network and coordinated expres-
sion events in breast cancer, we identified a molecular mechanism
by which PRC2 activity is restricted in TNBC. We discovered that
HIF1-α (Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α), which is highly activated in
TNBC, is a crucial inhibitor of PRC2 activity. We also found that
Ezh2 interacts with FoxM1 (Forkhead box M1), independent of
Significance
The plasticity of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in the
context of tumorigenesis has remained a subject of contention.
Here we demonstrate that the equilibrium between the onco-
genic and tumor-suppressive activity of PRC2 in promoting breast
cancer invasion is tightly regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor
1-α. PRC2 acts as a tumor-suppressor barrier to the hypoxia-
driven invasion pathway, and the impaired PRC2 activity upon
hypoxia promotes a chromatin switch at proinvasion matrix
metalloproteinase gene loci. The study fundamentally changed
our understanding of the role of PRC2 in breast cancer and also
identified a previously unidentified function of enhancer of zeste
2 to complex with Forkhead box M1 to promote cancer invasion.

 PRC2, to promote invasion and the expression of MMP (matrix
metalloproteinase) genes (hereafter, MMPs). Strikingly, PRC2 and
the Ezh2/FoxM1 complex co-occupy the same MMP promoters,
where they act antagonistically in regulating expression of MMPs.
Upon hypoxia, HIF1-α induction underlies a functional switch from
PRC2-mediated gene suppression to the Ezh2/FoxM1-mediated
induction of MMP expression.
Results
Loss of PRC2-Mediated Gene Expression Is Accompanied by Up-
Regulation of EZH2, HIF1A, and FOXM1 in TNBC. Previous integrative
genomic analyses have implicated a number of transcriptional
networks in breast cancer, among which several transcription
factors such as the HIF1-α– and FoxM1-regulatory pathways have
been found to be particularly enriched in TNBC (4, 24). In ad-
dition, HIF1-α has been reported to bind to the promoters of
EZH2 (25) and FOXM1 (26) to activate their expression, and
all have been implicated in breast cancer invasion and metastasis
(27–29). These findings suggest a possible functional convergence
among these invasive drivers in TNBC progression.
To uncover a potential interaction among the invasion-associated
regulators HIF1-α, Ezh2/PRC2, and FoxM1 in breast cancer, we
interrogated the gene-expression data of breast cancer in The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and examined their expression
patterns in different subtypes of breast cancer together with their
respective target gene sets, as reported previously (Fig. 1A) (30–32).
Remarkably, gene-clustering analysis showed that HIF1A, FOXM1,
and EZH2 expression were highly enriched in TNBC as compared
with other subtypes (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1A). This result is consistent
with the highly invasive nature of TNBC. Of significant interest,
despite the higher expression of EZH2 in TNBC, the expression of
another major PRC2 component, suppressor of zeste 12 protein
homolog (SUZ12), did not show concomitant high expression in
TNBC as compared with other subtypes of breast cancer (Fig. S1A).
This observation was further validated independently using GOBO
online analysis (co.bmc.lu.se/gobo) (33), in which, despite the
higher expression of EZH2 in TNBC, SUZ12 expression was found
to be higher in the luminal B breast cancer subtype but not in
TNBC (Fig. 1B, Upper). Moreover, the concerted expression of
EZH2 with progressive induction in breast tumors from grade 1 to
grade 3 was not observed for SUZ12 (Fig. 1B, Lower). Consistently,
PRC2-repressed target genes were de-repressed in TNBC com-
pared with other subtypes, suggesting that PRC2 repressive activity
is impaired in TNBC (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1A). In contrast, repressive
PRC2 activity was robust in the luminal B subtype, which exhibited
the lowest expression of PRC2-repressed targets. Of note, high
expression of HIF target genes was found exclusively in TNBC and
was correlated with the expression of HIF1A but not HIF2A

 (EPAS1) (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1A). Furthermore, HIF1A expression
showed progressive induction in breast tumors from grade 1 to
grade 3, and HIF2A (EPAS1) expression showed the opposite (Fig.
1B); this result is consistent with the antagonistic relationship be-
tween HIF1-α and HIF2-α reported previously in breast cancer
(34). These observations indicate that the differential regulation of
Ezh2 and PRC2 function in different subtypes of breast cancer
might be associated with HIF1-α and that the up-regulation of
Ezh2 in TNBC may implicate a PRC2-independent function,
supporting previously reported non-PRC2 activity of Ezh2 in
TNBC (8, 13).
To establish further a possible coregulation of HIF1-α, Ezh2,
and FoxM1 and their relationships with repressive PRC2 activity,
we next sought to evaluate correlation analysis within these
regulators. For this purpose, we calculated Pearson’s correlation
(Fig. 1C and Fig. S1C) and principal component analysis (PCA)
(Fig. 1D and Fig. S1D) in the TCGA dataset and in another larger,
independent dataset from Curtis et al., which contains 2,000 breast
tumor samples (24). As shown in Fig. 1 C and D and Fig. S1 C and
D, these analyses revealed several interesting findings: (i) HIF1A
showed either a negative or no correlation with SUZ12 but a
positive correlation with PRC2-repressed targets, indicating a re-
verse relationship between HIF1A and repressive PRC2 activity;
(ii) EZH2 and FOXM1 expression showed a strong positive cor-
relation in both breast cancer datasets, suggesting a potential co-
ordinated coregulation between these two regulators; (iii) FOXM1
invasive targets showed a strong positive correlation with PRC2-
repressed targets, indicating that reduced repressive PRC2 activity
is correlated with higher invasive activity of FoxM1.
Of interest, there are several well-documented reports on the
inhibitory role of transcription factor HIF-1 during cancer pro-
gression (35–37). Taken together, our findings raise a hypothesis
in which the impaired repressive PRC2 activity in TNBC, as in-
dicated by the abundant expression of PRC2-repressed targets,
may be attributed to high HIF1-α activity, whereas HIF1-α, Ezh2,
and FoxM1 are positively coregulated to promote invasion.
HIF1-α Activation by Hypoxia Results in Inhibition of PRC2 Activity.
Having shown that an impairment of repressive PRC2 activity is
correlated with HIF1A in TNBC, we sought to validate experi-
mentally the functional impact of HIF1-α on the repressive
PRC2 activity. To this end, MDA-MB231 cells were subjected to
hypoxia or serum-starvation growth conditions; the latter con-
dition is also known to activate HIF1-α (38). Cells that were
serum starved or exposed to hypoxia for 48 h exhibited increased
HIF1-α and HIF2-α proteins with concurrent up-regulation of
FoxM1, which was particularly strong under the hypoxic condi-
tion (Fig. 2A, Left). In addition, we observed marked down-
regulation of Eed (Embryonic ectoderm development), Suz12,
and H3K27me3 in cells in which HIF1-α was induced by hypoxia
and to a lesser extent in cells treated with serum starvation (Fig.
2A). The inhibitory effect of hypoxia on PRC2 activity was not
restricted to MDA-MB231 cells but also was seen in other TNBC
cell lines, e.g., HS578T and BT549 (Fig. 2A). In comparison, we
did not see a consistent inactivation of PRC2 in luminal A and
luminal B cell lines (Fig. S2), suggesting that hypoxia-induced
inhibition of PRC2 is more relevant to TNBC. We further showed
that this effect was HIF1-α dependent, because knockdown of
HIF1A with two independent siRNA sequences restored the pro-
tein expression of Suz12, Eed, and H3K27me3 but abolished
FoxM1 induction (Fig. 2B). Consistently with the HIF1-α–mediated
induction of FoxM1, we also observed recruitment of HIF1-α on
the FOXM1 promoter in multiple TNBC cell lines treated with
hypoxia (Fig. 2C). Subsequent investigation into the transcript levels
of PRC2 components revealed that hypoxia specifically induced
EZH2 mRNA expression and, paradoxically, repressed SUZ12 and
EED mRNA expression; this repression was reversed by HIF1A
knockdown (Fig. 2D). In contrast, knockdown of HIF2A failed to
rescue the hypoxia-induced repression of SUZ12 and EED and
even further up-regulated EZH2 mRNA, further validating the
role of HIF1-α, rather than HIF2-α, in repressing PRC2. As a
functional readout of repressive PRC2 activity, we showed that
hypoxia induced the expression of two known PRC2-repressed target
genes, CDKN1A (encoding p21) and CDKN1C (encoding p57) (31,
39, 40), recapitulating the effect of EZH2 knockdown (Fig. 2E).
Together, these findings suggest a previously unidentified mechanism
whereby HIF1-α activation leads to PRC2 inactivation by selectively
suppressing the expression of SUZ12 and EED but not EZH2.
The transcription factor HIF1-α has been shown previously to
have both transcriptional activator and transcriptional repressor
activities. We next investigated if HIF1-α represses the expression
of SUZ12 and EED through direct binding to their respective
promoters. As shown in Fig. 2F, HIF1-α binding was detected at the
proximal promoters of SUZ12 and EED and was further enriched
upon hypoxia treatment. In addition, we also observed reduced

 enrichment of the active H3K27 acetylation marker at both pro-
moters upon hypoxia. Taken together, these findings demonstrate
that activation of HIF1-α by hypoxia leads to transcriptional in-
activation of PRC2 in TNBC.
Reciprocal Coregulation of EZH2 and FOXM1 Promotes Invasion
Independently of PRC2. Both Ezh2 and FoxM1 have been impli-
cated in breast cancer progression by regulating the cell cycle, in-
vasion, and metastasis (23, 32, 41–44). Given the well-coordinated
expression of EZH2 and FOXM1 in breast cancer as seen in Fig. 1
A and C and Fig. S1 A and C, we asked whether Ezh2 and FoxM1
coregulate each other. Remarkably, EZH2 knockdown efficiently
ablated FOXM1 expression at both the transcript and protein
levels, and vice versa, in multiple TNBC cell lines including MDA-
MB231, SUM159PT, HS578T, and BT549 (Fig. 3A and Fig. S3A),
but it did not affect the expression of SUZ12 or EED (Fig. 3A,
Right). Moreover, in contrast to EZH2 knockdown, EED or SUZ12
knockdown had no effect on the expression of EZH2 and FOXM1
(Fig. 3B). The specificity of EZH2 siRNA was further validated by
using another siRNA sequence targeting the 5′ UTR of EZH2,
which allows ectopic EZH2 overexpression for a rescue experiment.
As expected, both the down-regulation of EZH2 and FOXM1
mRNA expression upon knockdown of endogenous EZH2 were
reversed by ectopic EZH2 overexpression (Fig. S3B). These results
suggest a reciprocal Ezh2 and FoxM1 regulation in TNBC.
The above findings prompted us to investigate whether the
Ezh2 and FoxM1 codependency might stem from transcriptional
activation at the other’s promoters. ChIP assays using a series of
PCR primers to probe for chromatin regions of respective pro-
moters in MDA-MB231 cells revealed marked Ezh2 recruitment
on the proximal FOXM1 promoter region [−60 bp from the
transcription start site (TSS)] (Fig. 3C, Upper) and FoxM1 re-
cruitment on the EZH2 promoter (−1,660 to −1,470 bp) (Fig.
3C, Lower).
Given the reciprocal regulation of Ezh2 and FoxM1, we next
investigated whether Ezh2 acts independently of PRC2 to in-
teract discretely with FoxM1. To do so, we performed Ezh2 and
FoxM1 immunoprecipitation experiments in MDA-MB231 cells.
As seen in Fig. 3D, Ezh2 pulldown coimmunoprecipitated with
both FoxM1 and Suz12 (Fig. 3D, Upper), whereas FoxM1 pull-
down coimmunoprecipitated only with Ezh2 but not with Suz12
(Fig. 3D, Lower). These results indicate that, in addition to PRC2,
Ezh2 also forms an independent protein complex with FoxM1.
This observation was further validated in other TNBC cell lines
(Fig. S3C). We also found that Ezh2 was required to maintain the
protein stability of FoxM1, because overexpression of EZH2 in
MDA-MB231 cells was able to prevent premature FoxM1 deg-
radation after the mitotic phase stimulated by the addition and
removal of nocodazole (Fig. S3D). Consistent with the positive
autoregulation of FOXM1 on its own promoter (45), we also
observed enrichments of Ezh2 and FoxM1 on the same region in
the FOXM1 promoter, and knockdown of FOXM1 reduced Ezh2
binding to the FOXM1 promoter (Fig. 3E). Interestingly, Ezh2
enrichment was not seen in the promoters of the well-known
FoxM1 targets in cell-cycle regulation, CCNB1 and AURKB, in-
dicating that the Ezh2–FoxM1 complex may not have an active
role in cell proliferation. Taken together, these results suggest that
Ezh2 and FoxM1 regulate each other at the transcriptional level
and particularly that Ezh2 complexes with FoxM1 to maintain the
stability of the latter protein, leading to the activation of FoxM1
expression as illustrated in Fig. 3E, Lower.
Next, we investigated the functional relevance of Ezh2/FoxM1
coregulation vs. repressive PRC2 in regulating TNBC invasion
upon hypoxia. We showed that hypoxia increased cell invasion in
MDA-MB231 cells and that this increase was ablated by EZH2
or FOXM1 knockdown (Fig. 3F). In contrast, knockdown of EED
or SUZ12 enhanced the invasive capacity (Fig. 3F), suggesting a
tumor-suppressive function of PRC2 in TNBC. The same result
was obtained in BT549 cells (Fig. S3E). This observation was
expected, because it is consistent with a recent report showing that
PRC2 inactivation favors breast tumorigenicity (17). Importantly,
the reduced cell invasion upon EZH2 knockdown was effectively
rescued with ectopic overexpression of FOXM1, but the H3K27me3
level remained depleted (Fig. 3G), indicating that FoxM1 has an
essential role in EZH2-mediated invasion that is independent of
PRC2/H3K27me3. Taken together, our findings identify FoxM1 as
a previously unidentified partner of Ezh2 in promoting TNBC in-
vasion. In contrast, the repressive PRC2, which seems to exert a
tumor-suppressive function in TNBC, might counteract the onco-
genic property of the previously unidentified Ezh2/FoxM1 complex.
However, these results raise the question of which downstream
target genes are affected by this paradoxical role of Ezh2/PRC2 in
response to hypoxia during TNBC invasion.

 HIF1-α, Ezh2, and FoxM1 Promote the Expression of MMPs to Counteract
PRC2-Mediated Repression. Hypoxia is known to regulate a cohort
of genes, including members of the MMP family and genes that
modulate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and thus
to promote cancer migration and invasion (28). We found that
hypoxia induced marked up-regulation of MMP expression
compared with normoxia, but this up-regulation was not seen for
the EMT regulators SNAI1 (encoding SNAIL), SNAI2 (encoding
SLUG), ZEB1 (Zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1), and ZEB2
(Fig. 4A), suggesting that hypoxia has a selective effect on MMPs
in the TNBC cellular context. Further analysis focusing on MMP2
and MMP7 validated that their hypoxia-induced expression was
dependent on HIF1-α, because concomitant HIF1A knockdown
reduced their expression (Fig. 4B). Strikingly, we found that the
expression of MMPs was differentially regulated by Ezh2 in nor-
moxia and hypoxia. EZH2 or FOXM1 knockdown induced the
expression of MMP2 and MMP7 in normoxia but reduced their
expression in hypoxia (Fig. 4C). In contrast, knocking down EED or
SUZ12 increased the expression of MMP2 and MMP7 in hypoxia
(Fig. 4C). These findings suggest that, although in normoxia Ezh2
functions in a PRC2-dependent manner to repress the expression of
MMPs, in hypoxia it partners with FoxM1 to promote the expres-
sion of MMPs to counter PRC2-mediated repression. Furthermore,
as did hypoxia, serum starvation induced the expression of MMPs
(Fig. S4A). The induction of MMPs with serum starvation also was
abolished by EZH2 siRNA treatment but was effectively rescued by
ectopic overexpression of EZH2 (Fig. S4B) or FOXM1 (Fig. S4C).
Collectively, these results demonstrate that in hypoxic or nutrition-
deprived breast cancer cells, Ezh2 switches its effect on MMPs from
repression to activation and that the activation requires FoxM1.
Hypoxia-Induced HIF1-α Modulates PRC2 and Ezh2/FoxM1 Recruitment
to the MMP Promoters. We next hypothesized that the regulation
of MMP expression is under the direct antagonistic influence of
both repressive PRC2 and a separate Ezh2/FoxM1 complex on MMP
promoters and that this influence is modulated by hypoxia-induced
HIF1-α. To test this hypothesis, we sought to investigate the occu-
pancy on the MMP2 and MMP7 promoters by PRC2 and associated
H3K27me3 and by Ezh2/FoxM1. As anticipated, in MDA-MB231
cells cultured in normoxia that expressed low levels of MMPs, ChIP
analysis showed abundant Eed and H3K27me3 enrichment, as well
as Ezh2 and FoxM1, in the MMP2 and MMP7 promoters (Fig. 5A).
Upon hypoxia, the MMP2 and MMP7 promoters exhibited reduced
Eed and H3K27me3 enrichment but increased recruitment of
HIF1-α and FoxM1, although increased Ezh2 binding was seen
only in the MMP2 promoter (Fig. 5B). The increased recruitment
of HIF1-α coupled with decreased H3K27me3 enrichment on the
promoters of MMP2/7 in response to hypoxia also was seen in
other TNBC cell lines, e.g., BT549 and HS578T (Fig. S5). Col-
lectively, these results demonstrate direct regulation of MMP
promoters by both PRC2 and the Ezh2/FoxM1 complex, which is
dynamically regulated by hypoxia-induced HIF1-α, resulting in
depletion of PRC2/H3K27me3 and increased expression of MMPs
through increased Ezh2/FoxM1 recruitment.
Furthermore, knockdown of FOXM1 reduced Ezh2 binding to
the MMP promoters, indicating the dependency of Ezh2 on
FoxM1 on the MMP promoters (Fig. 5C). To demonstrate the
co-occupancy of Ezh2, FoxM1, and PRC2 on the same promoter,
we performed pairwise sequential ChIP analyses. After the first
Ezh2 immunoprecipitate, both FoxM1 and Eed bindings were
also found to be enriched in Ezh2-bound MMP2 and MMP7 pro-
moters under normoxia (Fig. 5D). Strikingly, the colocalization of
these regulators on the MMP promoters was dynamically altered
under hypoxia: FoxM1 was further enriched, but Eed enrichment
was markedly reduced. These findings suggest that PRC2 and Ezh2/
FoxM1 colocalize to the same MMP promoters, where they act
antagonistically to regulate the expression of MMPs.

 To demonstrate further the coordination of Ezh2 and FoxM1
in promoting MMP expression and invasion, we overexpressed
EZH2, FOXM1, or both in an immortalized human mammary
epithelial cell line, MCF10A (Fig. S6A), and evaluated their effects
on the expression of MMPs and cellular outcomes. Overexpression
of EZH2 or FOXM1 alone induced only a modest increase in
invasion, whereas their coexpression resulted in marked increase in
invasion (Fig. S6B). Consistent with the change in the invasive
phenotype, we observed a marked increase in the mRNA expres-
sion of a subset of MMPs only in MCF10A cells overexpressing both
EZH2 and FOXM1; single-gene overexpression seemed to be in-
sufficient to induce the same effect (Fig. S6C). As a comparison, we
did not see such a change in EMT-related genes, with the exception
of ZEB2 (Fig. S6C). ChIP analysis further showed that over-
expression of EZH2 or FOXM1 led to enriched recruitment to the
MMP2 and MMP7 promoters and that coexpression of EZH2 and
FOXM1 resulted in further enrichment of both promoters (Fig.
S6D), highlighting the coordinated effect of Ezh2 and FoxM1 in
promoting the expression of MMPs. Of note, although we detected
marked enrichment of Ezh2 or FoxM1 in the MMP promoters in
the cells overexpressing EZH2 or FOXM1 as single genes (Fig.
S6D), we did not observe corresponding increases in the expression
of MMPs (Fig. S6C). These findings further support the notion that
a concerted effort between Ezh2 and FoxM1 is required to promote
a robust expression of MMPs and invasion.
Pharmacological Inhibition of PRC2 Promotes the Expression of Ezh2/
FoxM1-Mediated MMPs and Invasion. Having shown an inhibitory
role of hypoxia-induced HIF1-α on PRC2 and H3K27me3, which
led to increased in MMP expression and invasion, we sought to
investigate whether direct inhibition of PRC2 activity by a small-
molecule enzymatic inhibitor of Ezh2 would achieve a similar
effect. For this purpose, we used GSK126, which is a selective
inhibitor of Ezh2 with potent activity to deplete global H3K27me3
(46). Indeed, GSK126 treatment in MDA-MB231 cells resulted in
nearly complete depletion of global H3K27me3 without affecting
the expression of either FoxM1 or a major component of PRC2
(Fig. 6A). As anticipated, MMP2 and MMP7, as well as CDKN1A
and CDKN1C, were markedly induced upon GSK126 treatment
(Fig. 6B), which recapitulated the effect of EED or SUZ12
knockdown as shown in Fig. 4C. In line with the effect on MMPs,
we detected increased invasion of MDA-MB231 cells in a GSK126
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6C), whereas no significant changes
were observed in 3D Matrigel growth and monolayer cell prolif-
eration in a number of TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB231, SUM159PT,
and HS578T) (Fig. S7 A and B). GSK126 also had no effect on cell-
cycle–related genes (Fig. S7C). Importantly, we showed that GSK126-
induced MMP2 and MMP7 expression was dependent on Ezh2 and
FoxM1, because depletion of either EZH2 or FOXM1 effectively
abolished the induction of MMPs by GSK126 (Fig. 6D).
We next investigated the effect of GSK126 on the formation of
the Ezh2/FoxM1 complex. Interestingly, coimmunoprecipitation
(co-IP) analysis detected increased Ezh2 in the immunoprecipi-
tate of FoxM1 in MDA-MB231 cells, and vice versa (Fig. 6E),
suggesting an enhanced physical interaction between Ezh2 and
FoxM1 upon GSK126 treatment. Furthermore, ChIP analysis
showed that GSK126 treatment decreased the enrichment
of H3K27me3 in MMP2 and MMP7 promoters but increased
recruitment of FoxM1, although to a lesser extent, in Ezh2 (Fig.
6F). Taken together, these results provided direct evidence that

in Disease Outcomes. To demonstrate the clinical relevance of
HIF1A, EZH2, and FOXM1 versus SUZ12 in breast cancer pro-
gression, we used the Curtis dataset (24), which consists of ex-
pression data of 1,556 tumor samples with clinical information.
We found that HIF1A, EZH2, or FOXM1 expression displayed
progressive up-regulation from grade 1 to grade 3 tumors, whereas
SUZ12 did not show such a change (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, the
time-to-death was significantly shorter for breast cancer pa-
tients whose tumors expressed higher levels of HIF1A, EZH2,
or FOXM1 (Fig. 7B). In contrast, breast cancer patients with high
expression of SUZ12 in their tumors had a significantly longer time-
to-death; this finding is consistent with PRC2 having a tumor-sup-
pressive role in breast cancer, as suggested in both our study and a
recent report (17). Next, we investigated whether these oncogenic
drivers correlated with patient distant metastasis-free survival
(DMFS) in comparison with SUZ12. As shown in the Hatzis
dataset (47), which contains clinical information about metas-
tasis occurrence, Kaplan–Meier analysis indicated that breast
cancer patients whose tumors had higher HIF1A expression had
a significantly higher risk of developing distant metastasis than
those with low expression (Fig. 7C). Consistently, EZH2 and
FOXM1 showed patterns similar to those of HIF1A, but an
opposite (albeit nonsignificant) trend was seen for SUZ12 (Fig.
7C). These data analyses further emphasize the clinical rele-
vance of our in vitro findings.
Taken together, our investigations uncovered several pre-
viously unidentified molecular insights into how a TNBC tumor
acquires enhanced invasive capacity through functional integration
of multiple transcriptional factors regulated by HIF1-α (summa-
rized in Fig. 7D). We propose that the expression of invasive MMPs
is counterbalanced by the presence of repressive PRC2 and the
activating Ezh2/FoxM1 complex on their promoters, conferring a
tight equilibrium of their expression. HIF1-α activation by hypoxia
impairs the PRC2 activity but enhances the expression of FoxM1,
resulting in a functional shift toward the transcriptional activation of
MMPs mediated by both HIF1-α and the Ezh2/FoxM1 complex. Of
note, the reciprocal regulation of Ezh2 and FoxM1 may further
enhance the robustness of this model, leading to sustained expres-
sion of MMPs. This model is consistent with the clinical observation
seen exclusively in TNBC patients, in whom high expression of
HIF1A, EZH2, FOXM1, and invasion targets was accompanied by
high expression of PRC2-repressed targets, indicating impaired
PRC2 activity (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1A).
Discussion
The elucidation of molecular mechanisms that define the con-
tribution of epigenetic programs to tumorigenesis is crucial for
designing correct and effective therapeutic strategies. In this
study, we used large-scale gene-expression data in breast cancer
as a starting point to identify candidate oncogenic pathways that
may orchestrate the PRC2 gene repressor program in different
subtypes of breast cancers. Our analysis revealed that TNBC
manifested defective PRC2 activity, as demonstrated by the
abundant expression of PRC2-repressed targets in TNBC com-
pared with other subtypes of breast cancer. We further demon-
strated that reduced PRC2 activity in TNBC was functionally
linked to HIF1-α activation, which subsequently promoted the
Ezh2/FoxM1 complex toward increasing expression of MMPs
and cellular invasion.
Using independent clinical datasets in breast cancer, we found
that the transcript level of HIF1A was up-regulated selectively in
TNBC patients, as is consistent with the up-regulation of in-
vasion-associated genes. In addition to the established mecha-
nism of HIF1-α activation by posttranslational modifications
(48–50), several studies have reported transcriptional activation
of HIF1A (51–53). We showed that up-regulation of HIF1A in
TNBC correlated with high expression of several well-known
PRC2-repressed targets, suggesting that HIF1-α has a selective
inhibitory role for PRC2 activity. We further demonstrated that
HIF1-α inhibited PRC2 activity through transcriptionally re-
pressed PRC2 components, SUZ12 and EED, selectively. In
contrast, HIF1-α was able to induce EZH2 mRNA expression, as
is consistent with a previous report identifying hypoxic response
element in EZH2 promoter (25). Of interest, a recent study has
reported that PRC2/H3K27me3 inactivation induces HIF1A mRNA
expression in multiple myeloma (54). Thus, it is possible that the
high HIF1A mRNA expression in TNBC is related to the loss of
PRC2 activity, thereby conferring a reciprocal negative feedback
loop between HIF1-α and PRC2 in TNBC. This phenomenon
warrants further investigation.
Another major finding in this study is the previously un-
identified cross-talk between EZH2 and FOXM1. The two regu-
late each other and also form a complex to regulate the expression
of MMPs and breast cancer cell invasion directly. We demonstrated
that Ezh2 complexed with FoxM1 in the MMP promoters. Im-
portantly, both reduced expression of MMPs and invasion could be
rescued by ectopic FOXM1 expression, suggesting that Ezh2 de-
pends on FoxM1 to enforce its oncogenic activity in this context.
The codependency of EZH2 and FOXM1 in inducing the expres-
sion of MMPs and invasion was demonstrated further in the non-
cancerous mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A. We showed that
marked induction of MMPs occurred only in cells that ectopically

 co-overexpressed EZH2 and FOXM1 and that this overexpression
was associated with a strong increase in invasion.
The discovery of the functional cross-talk between EZH2 and
FOXM1 in regulating MMPs and invasion provides important
insights into the molecular functions of FOXM1 in breast cancer
progression. Although FOXM1 has been connected to a wide
spectrum of cellular processes in tumorigenesis, its precise con-
tribution to malignancies is still the subject of speculation. As
one of the key cell-cycle regulators, FOXM1 hyperactivation in
the onset of tumorigenesis could reflect its role as an oncogenic
driver. Alternatively, the hyperactivation of FOXM1 could simply be
a passenger effect, given that cancer cells generally have a higher
proliferative capacity than normal cells. This possibility is further
illustrated by a study showing that an elevated level of FOXM1 in
TNBC does not correlate with proliferation markers (29). These
authors also reported that the poor prognostic value of TNBC does
not correlate with its proliferative capacity but instead reflects its
metastatic potential, suggesting that FOXM1 possesses an addi-
tional tumorigenic role beyond cell-cycle regulation. This obser-
vation is further supported by the effects of FOXM1 depletion, in
which certain cancer cells are viable and proliferate but are severely
reduced in tumorigenicity (55–57). Our works suggest that during
hypoxia EZH2 may direct FOXM1 for a more invasive phenotype.
It is important to note that this effect of EZH2 acting through
FOXM1 was independent of the catalytic activity of PRC2 on
H3K27me3, as is consistent with growing reports that EZH2 has
non-PRC2 roles usually associated with transcriptional activation
(8–13). Paradoxically, Ezh2 also complexes with Suz12 and Eed
to suppress MMP promoters directly, providing a predominant
tumor-suppressor mechanism by inhibiting the expression of
MMPs in normoxia. As such, the pharmacologic inhibition of
Ezh2 histone methyltransferase activity or the knockdown of the
PRC2 components SUZ12 and EED resulted in increased ex-
pression of MMPs and invasive capacity. Thus, to our knowledge,
our study provides the first example showing the molecular in-
terface between these two antagonistic Ezh2 complexes in regulating
the transcription of MMPs associated with breast cancer invasion. In
response to hypoxia, HIF1-α induction inhibited PRC2 activity to
facilitate Ezh2/FoxM1-mediated activation of MMPs.
Our analysis of an antagonistic role of HIF1-α on repressive
PRC2 activity eventually led to the recognition of the paradox-
ical nature of EZH2, which exhibited both tumor-suppressive
and oncogenic properties. The paradoxical role of EZH2 in tu-
morigenesis has been observed in several human cancers (16).
Although its oncogenic role in promoting cancer progression has
been well documented, in certain contexts it also can function as
a tumor suppressor (17, 20, 58–61). In addition to leukemia, a
tumor-suppressive role for EZH2 has been found in solid tumors
such as pancreatic (61) and renal cancer (60). Moreover, in a
BRCA1-deficient mouse model of breast cancer, EZH2 depletion
was found to facilitate tumor formation (20), indicating that EZH2
also has a tumor-suppressive role in breast cancer. This view is
supported further by a recent study showing that impaired PRC2
activity promotes breast (17) and lung (18) tumorigenesis.
In summary, our findings uncovered a previously unidentified
mechanism of PRC2 regulation in breast cancer and demonstrated
an intricate equilibrium of PRC2 and Ezh2/FoxM1 in regulating
MMP expression. Our data suggest that the reduced PRC2 activity
upon hypoxia might promote cancer invasion through Ezh2/FoxM1-
mediated induction of MMPs, and this suggestion was supported
further by clinical data analysis showing that high expression of
HIF1A, EZH2, or FOXM1 was associated with high tumor grade,
high metastasis propensity, and worse survival outcome, whereas
high expression of SUZ12 conferred a protective role with a more
favorable survival outcome. Thus, catalytic inhibitors of EZH2,
which are under clinical development, might not be appropriate
for treating TNBC. Instead, a rational design based on the mo-
lecular pictures we have provided could pave the way for new
therapeutic options for TNBC.

from the American Type Culture Collection and were cultured in an incubator
set at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 95% atmospheric air. MDA-MB231, HS578T, and
BT549 cells were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10%
(vol/vol) FBS (Invitrogen). SUM159PT cells were maintained in Ham’s F-12
medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% (vol/vol) FBS, 5 μg/mL insulin
(Invitrogen), and 1 μg/mL hydrocortisone (Invitrogen). MCF10A cells were
maintained in mammary epithelial growth medium (MEGM) (Invitrogen)
supplemented with 5% (vol/vol) horse serum (Invitrogen), 20 ng/mL EGF
(Invitrogen), 0.5 mg/mL hydrocortisone, 100 ng/mL cholera toxin (Invitrogen),
and 10 μg/mL insulin. All media were supplemented with 5,000U/mL penicillin/
streptomycin mixture (Invitrogen). For hypoxia, cells were grown in a hypoxia
incubator at 37 °C in 4% O2 and 5% CO2. For drug treatment, cells were
treated with GSK126 (Pharmaron, Inc.) for 72 h.

 Gene-Expression Dataset Analysis. To determine the expression levels of HIF1A,
EZH2, and FOXM1 and the expression of their target genes in breast cancer
patients, normalized mRNA expression data derived from the Agilent expres-
sion platform, “BRCA.exp.547.med.txt.”, was obtained from the TCGA breast
cancer online portal (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/docs/publications/brca_2012/).
PAM50 subtype classifications were available for 547 of the primary breast
invasive carcinoma tumor samples, and these samples were further classified
into four intrinsic breast cancer subtypes: TNBC (98), HER2-enriched (58), lu-
minal A (232), and luminal B (129). To establish the clinical relevance further,
two independent microarray datasets of breast cancer cohorts, Curtis (24) and
Hatzis (47), were downloaded from Oncomine (https://www.oncomine.org//).
Hierarchical clustering analysis was generated using Cluster 3.0, and a gene
heat map was further visualized using TreeView (Eisen).
Transfection of siRNA and Plasmid Vectors. siRNA and plasmid transfections
were conducted using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) and Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen), respectively, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Target-specific siRNA and nontargeting control siRNA were purchased from
Integrated DNA Technologies Singapore with the following sequences: HIF1A:
5′-UCAAGUUGCUGGUCAUCAG-3′;
EZH2:
5′-GACUCUGAAUGCAGUUGCU-3′;
EZH2 5′ UTR: 5′-CGGUGGGACUCAGAAGGCA-3′; FOXM1: 5′-GGACCACUUUC-

HSC.RNAI.NO15355.12.1_; and SUZ12 no. 2: HSC.RNAI.N015355.12.2_.
To generate stable overexpression cell lines, target genes from their re-
spective transient expression plasmids were subcloned into PMN retroviral
expression vectors (a gift from Linda Penn’s laboratory, Ontario Cancer In-
stitute, Ontario, Canada). EZH2 plasmid had been described previously (8)
and FOXM1 plasmid was a gift from Eric Lam, Imperial College London,
London. Cells were infected with retrovirus packaged with PMN-EZH2 or PMN-
FOXM1 or with the PMN-empty vector for 48 h, followed by cell sorting for
selection of GFP overexpressed cells.
Histone Extraction and Immunoblots. Whole-cell extract was prepared as
described previously (31). For histone extraction, cells were lysed in Triton
extraction buffer (1× PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 2 mM PMSF). The histone
pellet was further collected for acid extraction in 0.2 N HCl overnight at 4 °C.
For protein lysate, briefly, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and further soni-
cated using an XL2000 Microson Ultrasonic Processor (Misonix). Equal
amounts of histone extract (2 μg) or protein extract (30 μg) were separated
on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes. These
membranes were further blocked with 5% (wt/vol) milk, and the immuno-
blots were probed with the following antibodies: anti-EED (07-368; 1:5,000),
anti-EED (09-774; 1:5,000), and anti-H3K27me3 (07-449; 1:1,000) were pur-
chased from Upstate Biotechnology, Millipore Corporation. Anti-Cyclin B (sc-
245; 1:1,000) and anti-FOXM1 (sc-500; 1:500) were purchased from Santa
Cruz. Anti-CDC2 (CST-9112; 1:1,000), anti-EZH2 (CST-3147; 1:1,000), and anti–
HIF1-α (CST-3716; 1:1,000) were purchased from Cell Signaling. Anti–HIF1-α
(Ab-2185; 1:1,000) and anti-SUZ12 (Ab-12073; 1:1,000) were purchased from
Abcam. Anti–HIF2-α (NB100-122; 1:500) was purchased from Novus Biologi-
cals, and anti-Actin (1:200,000) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Co-IP. Co-IP was performed as described previously (8). Briefly, cells were
lysed with 1 mL of immunoprecipitation lysis buffer [20 mM Tris·HCl (pH 7.4),
2 mM EDTA, 25 mM NaF, and 1% Triton X-100] supplemented with protease
inhibitors (Roche). The lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody
pulldown and Protein A/G agarose beads (Roche) overnight at 4 °C. The
agarose beads were further washed three times with washing buffer [50 mM
Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate,
and 0.1% SDS]. The immune complexes were subsequently eluted with
sample buffer containing 1% SDS and DTT for 5 min at 95 °C. The sample
was subsequently separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred
to PVDF membranes for immunoblotting. Antibodies used for pulldown
were nonspecific IgG (sc-2025 or sc-2027) and anti-FOXM1 (sc-500 or sc-502)
purchased from Santa Cruz. Anti-EZH2 (39901 or 39875) was purchased from
Active Motif. The subsequent immunoblots were probed with anti-EED (09-
774; 1:5,000) purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Millipore Corporation,
anti-EZH2 (CST-3147; 1:1,000) purchased from Cell Signaling, anti-FOXM1
(sc-500 or sc-502; 1:500) purchased from Santa Cruz, and anti-SUZ12 (Ab-
12073; 1:1,000) purchased from Abcam.
Quantitative RT-PCR, ChIP, and Sequential ChIP. Total RNA was isolated using
TRIzol (Invitrogen) and extracted with the RNAeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). A total
of 1,000 μg RNA was reverse-transcribed using the High-Capacity cDNA Re-
verse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems), and the product subsequently
was subjected to quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) with the KAPA SyBr
Fast qPCR Kit (KAPA Biosystems). All reactions were performed in triplicate
using an Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system in a 96-well
plate format. Primer sequences can be found in Table S1. For quantification
of mRNA levels, ACTB mRNA level were used as an internal control.
ChIP was performed as described previously (31). Briefly, precleared chro-
matin was immunoprecipitated with the following antibodies: anti-EZH2
(39901; Active Motif), anti-FOXM1 (sc-500; Santa Cruz), anti-EED (09-733;
Millipore), anti-H3K27me3 (9744; Cell Signaling), anti–HIF1-α (Ab-2185),
and a nonspecific IgG (sc-2027; Santa Cruz). For sequential ChIP, after the
first antibody pulldown, the chromatin was further eluted with 10 mM DTT
by gentle shaking at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by a second antibody pulldown.
The immunoprecipitated DNA and input DNA were quantified by qRT-PCR
analysis; primer sequences can be found in Table S2. Quantification of
promoter-binding enrichment was defined as the percentage of the whole-
cell lysate relative to the input DNA. The fold-enrichment was calculated
by normalizing the specific antibody-enriched against the nonspecific IgG-
enriched chromatins. All ChIP qRT-PCR promoter primer sequences were
synthesized and purchased from AITbiotech.
Phenotypic Assays: Proliferation Assay, 3D Matrigel Growth, Migration Assay,
and Invasion Assay. To measure the rate of cellular proliferation, cells were assayed
with CellTiter-Glo (CTG) (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells
were lysed with CTG solution, and the chemiluminescent signal was detected with
a microplate reader (Tecan). The growth rate was calculated by normalizing the
CTG values obtained with those taken on day 1 and plotted against time.
For 3D Matrigel growth, an eight-well chamber slide (BD Biosciences) was
overlaid with 45 μL of growth factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and
incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. For each breast cancer cell line, 5 × 103 cells
were seeded in each chamber with 400 μL complete culture medium sup-
plemented with 4% (wt/vol) Matrigel. The culture medium was replaced at
2-d intervals, and phase-contrast images were captured for 7 d at 3-d intervals.
For the invasion assay, a 24-well Falcon FluoroBlok Transwell insert (BD
Biosciences) with a pore size of 8 μm was overlaid with 250 μg/mL of Matrigel
and incubated for 6 h at 37 °C. For MDA-MB231 and BT549 cells, 2.5 × 104
cells were seeded in each insert with DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS. For
MCF10A cells, 5 × 104 cells were seeded in each insert with MEGM supplemented
with 0.5% horse serum. The chemoattractant used was the respective complete
culture medium for each cell line and was added into the outer chamber. In-
vaded cells were fixed after 48-h incubation time using 3.7% (vol/vol) formal-
dehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) and were stained with 25 μg/mL propidium iodide. Ten
fields per insert were scanned, and average invaded cells were counted in trip-
licate using a Cellomics ArrayScan reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Statistical Analysis: Pearson’s Correlation, PCA Analysis, Tumor Grade, Time-
to-Death, and DMFS. The data were presented as the mean values ± SEM.
Comparisons between groups were evaluated by Student’s t test, one-way
ANOVA, or two-way ANOVA as indicated in the respective figures. Values of
at least P ≤ 0.05 (or as indicated in each figure legend) were considered to be
statistically significant. For correlation analysis of differential gene expres-
sion, Pearson’s correlation coefficient was performed using GraphPad Prism
6. The statistical significance of the correlation was expressed as a P value.
PCA was performed using IBM SPSS statistics 20 to analyze further the
clustering of differential gene expression.
For tumor grading, the Curtis gene-expression data (24) with corresponding
tumor-grade information were used. Patients were stratified into groups with high
or low expression of HIF1A, EZH2, FOXM1, SUZ12, or EED by calculating the me-
dian level of gene expression in the respective tumor grade. Quantification of
enrichment for each gene expression was defined as the number of patients whose
tumors expressed high expression for a particular gene relative to the number of
patients whose tumors expressed low expression for the corresponding gene.
For survival analysis, the time-to-death was examined specifically in de-
ceased patients with grade 3 tumors. The median follow-up time for death
was calculated, and a Mann–Whitney test was performed to determine
whether the observed differences between patients with high or low expression
of HIF1A, EZH2, FOXM1, or SUZ12 were statistically significant. For
DMFS, Hatzis gene-expression data (47) with corresponding metastatic
status were used. The survival curves were performed by the Kaplan–
Meier method, and the P value was calculated by log-rank test with a
hazard ratio between high or low expression of HIF1A, EZH2, FOXM1, or
SUZ12 determined by the log-rank method.
