Abstract
OBJECTIVES: The median age at diagnosis of patients with pleural mesothelioma in the UK is 73 years. Recent series have shown the feasi-
bility of extended pleurectomy decortication in the elderly, but with continuing debate about the efficacy of this treatment, we reviewed
our experience to identify more detailed selection criteria.
METHODS: We reviewed prospectively collected data on all patients from 1999 to 2016 undergoing extended pleurectomy decortication.
We compared clinical and pathological outcomes and survival data from patients 70 years and older (>
_70 years) with those younger than
70 years (<70 years).
RESULTS: Eighty-two of the 300 (27.3%) patients were >
_70 years of age at the time of surgery. More patients in the elderly group required
intensive care postoperatively (6.2 vs 16.7%, P = 0.01) and developed atrial fibrillation (14.4 vs 24.4%, P = 0.05). There was no intergroup dif-
ference in length of hospital stay or in in-hospital, 30-day or 90-day mortality. Elderly patients were less likely to receive neoadjuvant
(<70 years 21.2%, >
_70 years 11.0%; P = 0.045) or adjuvant chemotherapy (<70 years 45.4%, >
_70 years 29.3%; P = 0.04). Median overall sur-
vival was similar: <70 years 14.0 months, >
_70 years 10.3 months; P = 0.29. However, in node-positive patients, survival was poorer in the eld-
erly (13.0 vs 9.1 months, P = 0.05), particularly in those with non-epithelioid tumours (3.8 vs 6.7 months, P = 0.04). On multivariable analysis,
age was not a significant prognostic factor, although lack of adjuvant therapy (P = 0.001) and admission to the intensive care unit
(P < 0.001) remained poor prognostic factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Although age in isolation should not be an exclusion criterion for extended pleurectomy decortication for mesothelioma,
in the elderly, a more rigorous preoperative evaluation of nodal disease and an additional assessment of fitness for adjuvant chemotherapy
are recommended.

INTRODUCTION
Survival of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM)
remains poor, with only one proven line of therapy available:
chemotherapy in the form of a platinum and pemetrexed dou-
blet [1]. Despite the ban on the importation of asbestos in the
developed world, the incidence of MPM continues to increase
worldwide [2, 3]. The use of radical surgery with either extrapleu-
ral pneumonectomy (EPP) or extended pleurectomy decortica-
tion (EPD) remains a topic of debate. However, several series
have shown that long-term survival can be achieved, with varying
morbidity and mortality rates, albeit in highly selected patients
[4–8].
The current median age at diagnosis of patients with MPM in
the UK is 73 years, and the majority of patients are older than
70 years at diagnosis [9, 10]. As an increasing number of older
patients, with more comorbidities and reduced physiological
reserve, are being referred for consideration of radical surgery,
we have moved from performing EPP to EPD in our centre
as
the
operation
of
choice
for
macroscopic
complete
resection [11].
Recently, data have been published regarding the use of EPD
in patients older than 70 years of age [12]. This experienced
group found that it is possible to safely perform an EPD in elderly
patients, with no increase in morbidity or mortality, and with

 maintained long-term survival outcomes. With the continuing
debate regarding the efficacy of EPD, we aimed to determine
whether the increasing age of patients undergoing this procedure
has influenced outcomes and to determine whether a more
detailed selection criteria was appropriate in certain cases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
All patients undergoing EPD for MPM from 1999 to 2016 were
identified from our institutional database. They were then sepa-
rated into 2 groups by age at operation: either younger than
70 years (<70 years) or 70 years and older (>
_70 years). Because of
the increasing age of patients, and differing comorbidity profile
of patients referred to our centre with mesothelioma for consid-
eration of radical surgery, an intentional transition from routinely
performing EPP to EPD occurred over this time period [11].
During the transition period, the main indications for EPD over
EPP were patient age, pulmonary function precluding a pneumo-
nectomy and mediastinal lymph node positivity. One hundred
and thirty-four patients underwent EPP during this same time
period.
Preoperative patient selection
As a tertiary referral centre, our institution receives referrals from
over 20 oncology units throughout the UK. Most patients are
referred with a biopsy or cytology-confirmed diagnosis of meso-
thelioma. If the diagnosis is only suspected, or the histological
subtype is not known, patients will undergo a video-assisted
thoracoscopic biopsy and talc pleurodesis under general anaes-
thetic at our centre. This provides a confirmation of diagnosis
and histological subtype where required and also allows the sur-
geon to make an additional direct assessment of resectability
intraoperatively. We have changed our policy regarding resection
in cases of sarcomatoid disease over the last 17 years and only
now offer radical surgery to those with biphasic or epithelioid
disease [13].
All patients underwent thoracic computed tomography to
determine clinical stage and resectability. Positron emission
tomography (PET) scanning is not routinely performed preopera-
tively, neither is invasive mediastinal staging. The majority of
patients performed standard pulmonary function tests, including
forced expiratory volume in 1 s and forced vital capacity, unless
they had a pleural effusion at the time of referral. However, these
test results are often difficult to interpret in the presence of an
advanced, restrictive tumour. Renal dysfunction was not a spe-
cific exclusion criterion for radical surgery.
Operative technique
All patients underwent an EPD, including by definition, resection
of the visceral and parietal pleura, and the pericardium and
hemi-diaphragm, unless the tumour was easily resected with
macroscopic clear margins from either or both of these struc-
tures. We have previously found that the diaphragm is not
involved by tumour in up to 30% of operated patients with
MPM, and as such, we will preserve the diaphragm in cases
where we can ensure an R1 resection [14]. Patients who
underwent an R2 resection were not included in this study; mac-
roscopic complete resection (R1) was achieved in all 300 patients.
Following EPD, patients were routinely managed in a dedicated
thoracic surgical high-dependency unit. Very rarely were there
preoperative plans for intensive care unit (ICU) admission
postoperatively.
Data collection
Our prospectively updated institutional database and patient case
notes were reviewed, and demographic, clinical and pathological
data were collected. Clinical disease progression was determined
from outpatient records, radiological review or correspondence
from referring clinicians. Progression-free survival was calculated
from the date of surgery to the first clinical or radiological finding
of progression, with patients being censored at the time of their
last review or at death. Overall survival was calculated from time
of operation to death or to the date of censoring. Mortality data
were updated monthly through data collection from local hospi-
tal databases, hospital episode statistics (HES) data or direct con-
tact with referring hospitals in cases where patients were not
from our local catchment area; the last date of censor was 23
April 2016. For those lost to follow-up, the date of censor was
their last follow-up date or known date of death.
Indication for neoadjuvant or adjuvant
chemotherapy
The provision of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy is at
the discretion of the referring oncologist. Given that we receive
surgical referrals from over 20 centres around the UK, oncologi-
cal practices, and therefore the neoadjuvant or adjuvant thera-
peutic strategies, differ markedly from centre to centre and
often patient to patient within centres. Increasing numbers of
patients are now receiving 2 cycles of platinum/pemetrexed
chemotherapy prior to surgical resection as part of the MARS2
study (NCT02040272). Before this, only a very small number of
patients (17.3%) were given chemotherapy treatment prior to
resection. In some cases, patients were treated with chemother-
apy as the first-line treatment and referred for surgical resection
on progression as opposed to receiving true neoadjuvant che-
motherapy. Many oncologists choose to reserve adjuvant che-
motherapy
treatment
until
there
is
evidence
of
disease
progression, whereas others will give adjuvant platinum/peme-
trexed to all patients or specifically to those with biphasic dis-
ease or pathological nodal disease [15]. This depends solely on
the practice of the referring oncologist, although we would usu-
ally recommend consideration of adjuvant chemotherapy in
biphasic disease or pathological proven nodal disease [15].
Given the lack of evidence regarding the optimal timing of che-
motherapy as part of multimodality therapy with radical surgery
with EPD, there are no standardized indications for adjuvant
therapy at present in the UK.
Statistical analysis
SPSS version 20 statistical software package was used for analysis.
Continuous data were analysed using the Mann–Whitney U-test,
as all continuous dependent variables in this study were not nor-
mally distributed. A histogram was produced for all continuous

 variables and normality checked visually. Also, a Shapiro–Wilk
test was performed and Q–Q plots were created to ensure
whether data were normally distributed. Categorical data were
compared between the 2 groups (<70 years or >
_70 years) using v2
test, or in cases when one or more of the cells had an expected
frequency of 5 or less, the Fisher’s exact test was used. A P-value
of
<0.05
was
considered
to
be
statistically
significant.
Progression-free and overall survival analyses were estimated
using the Kaplan–Meier method with log-rank test to compare
for differences between the groups. The multivariable model was
created using a Cox regression analysis. Variables with a P-value
of < 0.1 were included in the model.
RESULTS
Patients
Three hundred patients were included in this study: 218 (72.7%)
patients in the <70 years group and 82 (27.3%) patients in the
>
_70 years group (Table 1). Median age of the entire cohort was
65 (range 42–81) years. In both groups, the majority of patients
were male (83%), and the majority had epithelioid subtype
(<70 years 77.5%, >
_70 years 76.8%; P = 0.95). Most patients were
pathological T Stage 3 (<70 years 52.3%, >
_70 years 47.6%; P = 0.18)
and a majority had lymph node metastases at operation
(<70 years 59.2%, >
_70 years 59.8%; P = 1.0).
More patients in the <70 years group received neoadjuvant
chemotherapy (<70 years 21.2%, >
_70 years 11.0%; P = 0.045).
There was no statistically significant difference between the
groups in terms of preoperative anaemia, thrombocytosis, lym-
phocytosis or raised creatinine levels (Table 1). Both groups had
a similar median preoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 s
[<70 years 71.5 (44–123)%, >
_70 years 70 (40–127)%; P = 0.96].
More patients were in performance Status 0 in the <70 years
group,
although
this
did
not
reach
statistical
significance
(<70 years 61.1%, >
_70 years 50.6%; P = 0.28).
Over this same time period, 134 patients underwent EPP.
Median age of these patients was 57 (range 14–70) years.
Similarly, to those undergoing EPD, the majority had epithelioid
subtype (72.4%) and were pathological T Stage 3 (47.8%). Despite
routine mediastinoscopy prior to EPP, 53.0% of patients were
either N1 or N2 positive at operation. Median overall survival of
all these patients, including all cell types and pathological stages,
was 12.9 months.
Perioperative course
There was no difference in median in-hospital length of stay
between the 2 groups [<70 years 12 (5–70) days, >
_70 years 14 (6–
93) days; P = 0.15].
More patients in the <70 years group received adjuvant che-
motherapy (<70 years 45.4%, >
_70 years 29.3%; P = 0.04). Those
with a preoperative performance status of 2 (3 patients) did not
receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Of the patients with a perform-
ance status of 1, 37.0% (34) patients received adjuvant therapy
compared with 45.9% (51) patients of those with a performance
status of 0 (P = 0.086).
Data regarding postoperative complications were available
for 287 patients (<70 years 209 patients, >
_70 years 78 patients)
(Table 2). There was a trend towards an increased incidence of
postoperative atrial fibrillation in the older group (14.4 vs 24.4%,
P = 0.05). There was a higher proportion of patients requiring
admission to the ICU postoperatively in the older group (6.2 vs
16.7% P = 0.01). In the majority of cases, this was for inotropic
support (<70 years 76.9%, >
_70 years 53.8%). Reintubation was
required in 1 patient in the <70 years group (7.7%) and 3 patients
in the >
_70 years group (23.1%). The remaining 5 patients suffered
major postoperative complications such as sepsis with or without
multiorgan failure. Despite this, there was no difference in terms
of in-hospital, 30-day or 90-day mortality between the 2 groups
(Table 2).
Survival outcomes
There was no difference in the median overall survival between
the 2 groups: <70 years 14.0 months, >
_70 years 10.3 months;
P = 0.29 [hazard ratio (HR) 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI)
0.872–1.580] (Fig. 1), i.e. age was not found to be a predictive fac-
tor for overall survival in patients undergoing EPD. There was
also no difference in median progression-free survival: <70 years
12.6 months, >
_70 years 14.5 months; P = 0.68 (HR 1.09, 95% CI
0.733–1.616). During the entire follow-up period, 222 (74%)
patients died.
In those with epithelioid disease, there was no significant dif-
ference between the age groups in terms of median overall sur-
vival: <70 years 17.7 months; >
_70 years 12.5 months; P = 0.14 (HR
1.30, 95% CI 0.917–1.830). The same was found for those with
non-epithelioid
disease:
<70 years
7.8 months,
>
_70 years
6.5 months; P = 0.674 (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.489–1.588). There was
no difference in median overall survival between the age groups
in those without nodal spread: <70 years 17.8 months, >
_70 years
16.0 months; P = 0.87 (HR 1.05, 95% CI 0.578–1.513). However, in
those with nodal disease at operation, elderly patients had a
poorer median overall survival: <70 years 13.0 months, >
_70 years
9.1 months; P = 0.05 (HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.002–2.140) (Fig. 2). In
patients with non-bulky disease (pT Stage 1 or 2), there was no
median overall survival difference between the groups: <70 years
16.2 months, >
_70 years 16.0 months; P = 0.83 (HR 0.94, 95% CI
0.554–1.604). In those with bulky disease (pT Stage 3 or 4), there
was a trend towards a poorer median overall survival in older
patients: <70 years 13.2 months, >
_70 years 9.2 months; P = 0.06
(HR 1.41, 95% CI 0.984–2.028) (Fig. 3).
In patients with non-epithelioid disease and nodal spread
(n = 28), there was a poorer median overall survival if they were
>
_70 years of age (6.7 vs 3.8 months, P = 0.04) (HR 2.13, 95% CI
1.001–5.320) (Fig. 4).
One-year survival was 47% in the younger (<70 years) group
and 38% in the older (>
_70 years) group. Three-year survival
was 8.7% in the younger and 11% in the older groups. Five-
year survival was 4.1% in the younger group and 0% in the
older group.
On multivariable analysis of factors known to affect outcome
in patients with MPM [16], non-epithelioid histological subtype
(HR 2.90, 95% CI 1.896–4.437; P < 0.001), lymph node spread (HR
1.64, 95% CI 1.071–1.918; P < 0.01), preoperative anaemia (HR
1.59, 95% CI 1.121–2.255; P = 0.011), not receiving adjuvant che-
motherapy (HR 1.93, 95% CI 1.390–2.688; P < 0.001) and immedi-
ate postoperative ICU admission (21 of 25 patients admitted to
intensive care) (HR 3.13, 95% CI 1.546–6.322; P = 0.01) were all
independent
prognostic
factors
for
overall
survival
(see

 DISCUSSION
We have shown that it is possible to safely perform an EPD on
patients older than 70 years, with no detriment to short- or long-
term outcomes. Age itself was not a prognostic factor for poor
overall survival outcomes, and as such, it should not be used in
isolation as a selection factor when determining suitability for
this type of surgery.
EPD has been shown to be a less morbid operation than EPP,
with a 27.9% morbidity rate compared with 62% with EPP [17].

 Moving to performing EPD as the operation of choice for radical
resection has allowed us to operate on older patients, with more
comorbidities and surgical risk factors [11]. Although the selec-
tion criteria for EPD are less strict than for EPP, it still remains an
operation with considerable morbidity and mortality risk, and
good patient selection is paramount [7, 8, 18].
The majority of outcome data for both operative procedures
come from retrospective institutional reports with differing
patient selection criteria and policies regarding neoadjuvant or
adjuvant therapy provision and as such are difficult to compare.
Similarly, many do not report stage or histological subtype-spe-
cific survival, which can be influential when comparing out-
comes. Several retrospective studies have shown that EPD can be
performed with good long-term oncological and overall survival
outcomes [4, 6]. One single-institution prospective study of multi-
modality therapy, with EPD as the surgical approach, showed a
median overall survival of 30 months [5]. In the recent systematic
review of multimodality therapy in MPM from Cao et al. [7], out-
comes of EPP and EPD were compared. Median overall survival
ranged between 13 and 29 months for EPD and 12 and
22 months for EPP [7]. This study concluded that EPP and EPD
can be performed safely with good long-term oncological out-
comes, in selected patients, in specialized centres.
The age of patients presenting with MPM is increasing in the
UK, with the median age currently 73 years [9]. This increasing
age at presentation is probably due to the changing patterns and
levels of exposure to asbestos over time; e.g. patients having
lower level exposure over longer periods of time as usage of the
material varied over the last 3 decades or exposure via relatives
working with the material as opposed to direct contact. There
was also an increase in the usage of amosite asbestos prior to the
ban towards the end of the last century, and it is thought that the
latency period is increased following exposure to this particular
type of asbestos, giving a later age at presentation.
This study has shown that we are able to perform macroscopic
complete resection, in the form of EPD, in patients older than
70 years, without affecting long-term overall and progression-
free survival outcomes. However, although it did not reach statis-
tical significance, it should be noted that there were no patients
older than 70 years alive at 5 years, when compared with 4.1% in
the younger than 70 years age group.
Those patients older than 70 years had a more complex post-
operative course, with a higher proportion developing atrial
fibrillation and a higher proportion requiring admission to the
ICU. In the majority of cases, admission to ICU was for short-
term (1–2 days) inotropic support. Despite this, there was no dif-
ference in in-hospital length of stay or in in-hospital, 30-day or
90-day mortality rates between the 2 groups of patients. Those
selected for EPD, either >
_70 years or < 70 years of age, must have
sufficient physiological reserve to tolerate the initial respiratory
insult and the potential complications of this major operation,
and as such, we must ensure that we continue to be highly selec-
tive when determining a patient’s fitness for surgery and include
objective measures of physiological fitness where possible.
Admission to ICU itself was found to be a significant predictor
of poor overall survival. In particular, the need for inotropic sup-
port must be avoided where possible through good preoperative
physiological optimization and accurate intraoperative fluid
management, especially in the elderly population.
We found there to be a significantly higher proportion of
patients in the younger (<70 years) age group receiving neoadju-
vant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy. It is unclear as to why there
was a higher proportion receiving neoadjuvant therapy; this may
be due to patient preference or possibly oncologist choice in
cases where they felt that elderly patients may be rendered unfit
for surgery following neoadjuvant chemotherapy or if they are
seen to be too old or have too many comorbidities to tolerate
chemotherapy upfront. The decision as to whether to give adju-
vant chemotherapy is made by the referring oncologist and is
based on patient fitness, as well as oncologist standard practice,
and, in some cases, histological subtype or lymph node spread
[15]. The only factor directly affecting adjuvant chemotherapy
provision was early space infection, and adjuvant chemotherapy
was not offered to these patients with ongoing infection. Given
that fitness for radical surgery does not necessarily equate to fit-
ness for adjuvant chemotherapy, an additional assessment for
adjuvant chemotherapy must be performed preoperatively. For
example, in our centre, chronic kidney disease does not necessa-
rily preclude a patient from undergoing EPD; however, this may
lead to a patient not receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. Given the
provision of adjuvant chemotherapy is a prognostic factor for
survival, and is also lower in the elderly group, we must ensure
that patients are going to remain fit for this treatment following
EPD before we agree to perform this procedure. As opposed to
the standard practice of a surgeon solely determining fitness for
surgical resection, it may be appropriate for further discussion
with our oncology colleagues after initial surgical assessment to
determine whether patients are likely to be suitable for chemo-
therapy treatment following resection. In cases where patients
are of borderline fitness, it may be more suitable to give neoad-
juvant chemotherapy, although there is limited evidence to show
a benefit of this treatment strategy prior to EPD [19]. We must
ensure that patients, particularly those of borderline fitness or of
advanced age, are not rendered unfit for adjuvant therapy due to
the morbidity of this major procedure. Although not statistically
significant, there was a difference in the proportion of patients
receiving adjuvant therapy depending on preoperative perform-
ance status, which may represent their physiological ability to
tolerate the morbidity associated with EPD.
Limitations
The main limitation of this study is its retrospective nature. It is
likely that those older than 70 years were strictly selected and do
not represent the entire cohort of patients in this age group with
the disease. However, this represents the problem we face as
clinicians; we must select our patients carefully for this operation
which is not without mortality and morbidity risk. The MARS2
trial: A Feasibility Study Comparing (Extended) Pleurectomy
Decortication Versus no Pleurectomy Decortication in Patients
With Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MARS2) (NCT02040272)
is currently recruiting in the UK and seeks to determine the role
of EPD in the treatment of MPM. The Phase III trial following on
from this feasibility trial will include patients older than 70 years
who will be randomized to chemotherapy plus surgery or che-
motherapy alone and should allow us to determine whether
there is a true benefit to pursuing this radical treatment strategy
in the elderly population. Another limitation is the variability in
the provision of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. As a
tertiary referral centre, we receive referrals from all over the UK,
and the practice of oncologists in different units varies. This could
result in biased results with regard to the effect of these therapies,
alongside EPD, on survival outcomes.

 It has been shown that the quality of life following EPD is
more markedly improved in patients who were symptomatic
prior to their operation compared with those who were in per-
formance Status 0, without detriment to the pulmonary function
[20]. It may be useful to determine the changes in the quality of
life in elderly and younger patients, as it may be possible that
older patients with more comorbidities have in fact more to gain
from undergoing EPD than younger, possibly less symptomatic,
patients. Quality-of-life assessment is an important aspect of the
MARS2 study, so we expect to gain an insight into the benefits or
otherwise with radical surgery from this analysis.
CONCLUSION
Although age itself should not be a criteria for selection for radi-
cal surgery with EPD, we must ensure that we do not render our
patients unfit for adjuvant chemotherapy and that we avoid the
need for postoperative intensive care admission where possible.
We must remain highly selective, while not excluding patients
from undergoing EPD based solely on their advanced age.
However, in cases of bulky disease or possible nodal disease, cau-
tion should be employed when selecting patients older than
70 years, given their potential poor overall survival following
EPD.
