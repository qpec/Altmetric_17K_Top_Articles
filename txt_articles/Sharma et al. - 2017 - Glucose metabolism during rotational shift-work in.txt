Abstract
Aims/hypothesis Shift-work is associated with circadian
rhythm disruption and an increased risk of obesity and type
2 diabetes. We sought to determine the effect of rotational
shift-work on glucose metabolism in humans.
Methods We studied 12 otherwise healthy nurses performing
rotational shift-work using a randomised crossover study de-
sign. On each occasion, participants underwent an isotope-
labelled mixed meal test during a simulated day shift and a
simulated night shift, enabling simultaneous measurement of
glucose flux and beta cell function using the oral minimal
model. We sought to determine differences in fasting and
postprandial glucose metabolism during the day shift vs the
night shift.
Results Postprandial glycaemic excursion was higher during
the night shift (381±33 vs 580±48 mmol/l per 5 h, p<0.01).
The time to peak insulin and C-peptide and nadir glucagon
suppression in response to meal ingestion was also delayed
during the night shift. While insulin action did not differ be-
tween study days, the beta cell responsivity to glucose (59±5
vs 44±4 × 10−9 min−1; p<0.001) and disposition index were
decreased during the night shift.
Conclusions/interpretation Impaired beta cell function during
the night shift may result from normal circadian variation, the
effect of rotational shift-work or a combination of both. As a
consequence, higher postprandial glucose concentrations are
observed during the night shift.

Introduction
Circadian disruption (i.e. a lack of synchrony between the
endogenous circadian rhythm and the behavioural/
environmental cycle) has been associated with an increased
risk of type 2 diabetes and obesity [1, 2]. The pattern of food
intake, exposure to light and (lack of) adequate sleep are all
established inputs that affect circadian function [3, 4] and have
been shown to negatively affect the regulation of glucose me-
tabolism [5]. Large epidemiological studies suggest that shift-
work is an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus

 [1, 2]. In addition, induction of experimental circadian mis-
alignment in otherwise healthy individuals leads to postpran-
dial hyperglycaemia, accompanied by decreased insulin con-
centrations within a few weeks of exposure [6, 7]. Given the
high prevalence of shift-work and night work in today’s soci-
ety (for example, 68% of nurses in the Nurses’ Health Study II
[8]), further studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms
driving increased susceptibility to type 2 diabetes in humans
experiencing work schedules associated with circadian
disruption.
Circadian regulation of insulin secretion and action has
long been appreciated as an important component of glucose
homeostasis [5]. In humans, the circadian system is organised
in a hierarchical manner [9]. Circadian pacemaker neurons
localised to the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus
synchronise (entrain) peripheral cell-autonomous circadian
oscillators expressed in most cell types [10]. The molecular
mechanism of the circadian clock is driven by a complex
system of transcriptional, translational and post-translational
feedback circuits operating with ~24 h periodicity [11]. The
positive limb of this circuit includes the CLOCK and BMAL1
genes, which encode proteins that dimerise and initiate tran-
scription through conserved promoter regions of ‘clock-con-
trolled’ genes, thus providing temporal regulation of genes
involved in diverse cellular processes [11]. Specifically, criti-
cal cellular pathways in beta cells are transcriptionally regu-
lated by the circadian clock [12]. Both in vivo and in vitro data
have shown that human pancreatic islets exhibit a robust 24 h
circadian rhythm in insulin secretion independent of circulat-
ing glucose concentrations [13]. Moreover, beta cell
responsivity to glucose is entrained by the light–dark cycle
and circadian clock gene expression [14], whereas disruption
of circadian rhythms and/or beta cell-specific deletion of
Bmal1 impair glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and com-
promise beta cell survival and proliferative potential [15].
The circadian system also regulates insulin signalling and
insulin action in tissues such as the liver, adipose and skeletal
muscle that are critical for metabolic control in type 2 diabetes
[16]. Consequently, disruption of circadian rhythms and/or
tissue-specific clock gene deletion impair insulin action and
induce glucose intolerance [17]. In the setting of impaired in-
sulin action, the expression of key clock genes is altered in
skeletal muscle and hepatic tissues [18]. In humans, shift-
work increases the risk of obesity [1], but it is uncertain whether
shift-work has direct effects on insulin action in humans [19].
Defects in both insulin secretion and insulin action contribute to
the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus [20]; however, the
underlying mechanism(s) by which shift-work increases this
risk in humans is not established.
This study was designed to test the hypothesis that rota-
tional shift-work raises postprandial glucose concentrations
by decreasing beta cell function in non-diabetic humans.
Beta cell function and glucose turnover were measured using
the C-peptide minimal model together with a triple-tracer
mixed meal [21] in volunteers during simulated day and night
shifts. The timing of the experiment was consistent with the
individuals’ work patterns so as to recapitulate physiological
shift-work conditions. The study order was randomised but
there was no other medical intervention. We report that beta
cell responsivity to glucose was impaired during the night
shift.
Methods
Participants After approval by the Mayo Institutional Review
Board, healthy rotational shift-workers were recruited by inter-
nal advertisement from the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, USA. All
volunteers worked the same hours with similar patterns (three
consecutive 12 h shifts from either 07:00–19:00 hours or
19:00–07:00 hours), comprising at least three night shifts per
month for at least 1 year. Informed written consent was obtain-
ed from all volunteers. Participants were studied on the third
day of their scheduled shift so as to adhere to their shift-work
pattern. Participants had no known active illness, no history of
symptomatic microvascular or macrovascular disease and were
not on medications that could affect glucose metabolism or
absorption. Studies were performed at >2 and <6 weeks apart.
Experimental design Participants were studied on two occa-
sions in random order within 6 weeks (Fig. 1). On one occasion,
volunteers were studied after two consecutive day shifts; on the
other, after two consecutive night shifts. Each 3 day block of
shift-work was preceded by 48 h of time off as per their usual
work cycle. They were admitted to the clinical research unit at
20:00 hours (for the day shift study) or at 08:00 hours (for the
night shift study) after the completion of their second shift.
Participants consumed a standardised mixed meal (two scram-
bled eggs, 50 g ham and 70 g gelatin dessert) and then slept in
darkened conditions. At 06:30 hours (for the day shift study) or
18:30 hours (for the night shift study; t = −180 min), a forearm
vein was cannulated with an 18 guage needle to enable infusions
to be performed. An 18 guage retrograde cannula was inserted
into a vein of the dorsum of the contralateral hand. This was
placed into a heated Plexiglas box maintained at 55°C to enable
sampling of arterialised venous blood (see electronic supplemen-
tary material [ESM] Table 1). A primed continuous infusion of
[6,6-2H2]glucose was initiated at 07:00 hours (for the day shift
study) or 19:00 hours (for the night shift study). At t = 0
(10:00 hours or 20:00 hours), participants consumed a mixed
meal consisting of two scrambled eggs, 50 g ham and gelatin
desert containing 70 g glucose enriched with [1-13C]glucose (4%
enrichment). Simultaneously, an infusion of [6-3H]glucose was
started and the infusion rate was varied to mimic the anticipated
appearance of meal [1-13C]glucose. The rate of infusion of
[6,6-2H2]glucose was altered to approximate the anticipated fall
1484

 in endogenous glucose production (EGP), thereby minimising
changes in specific activity (see ESM Table 2) [22].
Consumption of the isotope meal was standardised.
Participants repeatedly ate a spoonful of gelatin desert follow-
ed by a spoonful of ham and egg until the meal was finished.
Participants were instructed to consume all of the meal within
15 min from the study start. At the end of the meal, partici-
pants drank 30 ml water. Blood samples were collected fre-
quently throughout the study. At 15:00 hours or 03:00 hours,
tracer infusions were stopped. Participants subsequently con-
sumed a meal, all cannulas were removed and then partici-
pants left the clinical research unit.
Analytical techniques Plasma samples were placed on ice,
centrifuged at 4°C, separated and then stored at −20°C until
assayed. Glucose concentrations were measured using the glu-
cose oxidase method (Yellow Springs Instruments, Yellow
Springs, OH, USA). Plasma insulin was measured using a
chemiluminescence assay (Access Assay; Beckman, Chaska,
MN, USA). Plasma glucagon and C-peptide concentrations were
measured by Radio-Immunoassay (Linco Research, St Louis,
MO, USA). Plasma [6,6-2H2]glucose and [1-13C]glucose enrich-
ments were measured using gas chromatographic MS
(Thermoquest, San Jose, CA, USA) to simultaneously monitor
C-1 plus C-2 and C-3 – C-6 fragments, as described by Beylot
et al. [23]. In addition, [6-3H]glucose specific activity was mea-
sured by liquid scintillation counting after deproteinisation and
anion exchange and cation exchange chromatography.
Calculations The systemic rates of meal appearance (Meal
Ra), EGP and glucose disappearance (Rd) were calculated
using Steele’s model [24]. Meal Ra was calculated by multi-
plying the Ra of [1-13C]glucose (obtained from the infusion
rate of [6-3H]glucose and the clamped plasma ratio of
[6-3H]glucose and [1-13C]glucose) by the meal enrichment
(ESM Fig. 1). The EGP rate was calculated from the infusion
rate of [6,6-2H2]glucose and the ratio of [6,6-2H2]glucose to
endogenous glucose concentration. Rd was calculated by
subtracting the change in glucose mass from the overall rate
of glucose appearance (i.e. Meal Ra + EGP). Values from −30
to 0 min were averaged and considered as basal. The area
above basal (AAB) was calculated using the trapezoidal rule.
Net postprandial insulin action (insulin sensitivity index
[Si]) was measured using the oral minimal model [21]. Beta
cell responsivity indices were estimated using the oral C-
peptide minimal model [21], incorporating age-associated
changes in C-peptide kinetics [25]. The model assumes that
insulin secretion comprises a static (ϕs) and a dynamic (ϕd)
component with an index of total beta cell responsivity to glu-
cose (Ф) derived from these two components. The disposition
index (DI) was subsequently calculated by multiplying Ф by Si.
Statistical analysis Data are presented as means ± SEM. The
primary analyses compared changes in fasting, peak, time to
peak and integrated hormone concentrations. Differences (day
shift vs night shift) were assessed using a paired, two-tailed t
test (for parametric values) or a Wilcoxon matched-pairs
signed rank test (for non-parametric values). All rates are
expressed per kilogram of lean body mass. The statistical
analysis was performed using Primer 5 (GraphPad Software,
San Diego, CA, USA). A p value of <0.05 was considered
statistically significant. Data analysed came from participants
with >90% complete datasets. If any data were missing, the
missing variable was interpolated or the last observation was
carried forward. Assuming similar variance in integrated glu-
cose concentrations (mean ± SD, 421 ± 62 mmol/l per 6 h) to
those observed in prior studies [26–28], the inclusion of 12
participants would provide 80% power to detect a ~ 25%
change in integrated glucose concentrations at α = 0.05. In
addition, assuming similar variation in DI to that observed
previously [28] in a study of volunteers with type 2 diabetes
(mean ± SD, 34 ± 15 × 10−14 l kg−1 min−2 pmol−1), a paired
study of 12 individuals would provide 80% power at an
α = 0.05 to detect an approximately 40% change
(13 × 10−14 l kg−1 min−2 pmol−1). This is similar to the effect
size observed with treatment with a dipeptidyl peptidase-4
inhibitor (a weak insulin secretagogue) [29].

 otherwise healthy nurses (10 women, two men) were studied.
Participants had fasting glucose concentrations of
4.6 ± 0.1 mmol/l and HbA1c concentrations of 5.0 ± 0.1%
(31 ± 0.6 mmol/mol). Another two individuals gave written,
informed consent but could not be included in the study be-
cause of scheduling conflicts.
Plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide and glucagon concen-
trations during a mixed meal Although fasting glucose con-
centrations did not differ between study days (Fig. 2a; day
shift vs night shift, 4.9 ± 0.1 vs 4.8 ± 0.1 mmol/l, p = 0.13),
integrated postprandial glucose concentrations were higher
during the night shift (day shift vs night shift, 381 ± 33 vs
580 ± 48 mmol/l per 5 h, p < 0.01), with an accompanying
delay in time to peak glucose concentrations (day shift vs
night shift, 50 ± 5 vs 69 ± 6 mins, p < 0.01).
During the night shift, fasting insulin concentrations were
lower (Fig. 2b; day shift vs night shift, 36 ± 5 vs 23 ± 3 pmol/l,
p < 0.01) and the time to peak insulin concentrations was de-
layed (day shift vs night shift, 61 ± 9 vs 76 ± 10 mins, p = 0.02).
Peak (day shift vs night shift, 623 ± 68 vs 540 ± 73 pmol/l,
p = 0.25) and integrated (day shift vs night shift, 57 ± 8 vs
55 ± 8 nmol/l per 5 h, p = 0.68) postprandial insulin concen-
trations did not differ between study days. However, the in-
crease in insulin concentration during the first 60 min after meal
ingestion was lower during the night shift (day shift vs night
shift, 20 ± 8 vs 14 ± 2 nmol/l per 5 h, p = 0.02).
Similarly, fasting C-peptide concentrations were lower dur-
ing the night shift (Fig. 2c; day shift vs night shift, 0.6 ± 0.06
vs 0.5 ± 0.04 nmol/l, p = 0.01), with a significant delay in time
to peak C-peptide concentrations (day shift vs night shift,
71 ± 9 vs 96 ± 7 mins, p = 0.01). Consistent with insulin
concentrations, peak and integrated postprandial C-peptide
concentrations did not differ between study days.
Fasting glucagon concentrations (Fig. 2d; day shift vs night
shift, 80 ± 5 vs 84 ± 5 ng/l, p = 0.35) did not differ between
study days. In addition, no differences in nadir (day shift vs
night shift, 61 ± 5 vs 62 ± 4 ng/l, p = 0.76) or integrated
glucagon concentrations (day shift vs night shift, 2.6 ± 1.8 vs
2.4 ± 1.5 μg/l, p = 0.07) were observed. However, the time to
maximal glucagon suppression was increased during the night
shift (day shift vs night shift, 85 ± 8 vs 123 ± 11 mins, p = 0.01).
Net insulin action, beta cell responsivity and DI during the
day and night shifts Net insulin action (Si), as measured by the
oral minimal model, did not differ between study days (day shift
vs night shift, 7.2 ± 1.8 vs 6.0 ± 1.2 10−7 l kg−1 min per pmol−1,
p = 0.50). The dynamic component of beta cell responsivity (ϕd;
Fig. 3a) also did not differ between study days. However, the
static component of beta cell responsivity to glucose was signif-
icantly impaired during the night shift (ϕs; day shift vs night
shift, 51 ± 5 vs 39 ± 3 × 10−9 min−1, p < 0.001; Fig. 3b).
Total beta cell responsivity (Φ; the sum of ϕd and ϕs) was
decreased during the night shift study day (day shift vs night

Φ was expressed as a function of the prevailing insulin action
as DI, this variable was also significantly decreased during the
night shift (Fig. 3d; day shift vs night shift, 114 ± 32 vs 68 ± 12
10−14 l kg−1 min−2 per pmol−1, p = 0.05) indicating impaired
beta cell function.
Rates of EGP, meal Ra and Rd during a mixed meal
Fasting EGP was lower (p = 0.02) during the night shift (day
shift vs night shift, 16.5 ± 0.7 vs 14.4 ± 0.6 μmol kg−1 min−1;
Fig. 4a). However, there was no difference in suppression to
nadir values following meal ingestion (day shift vs night shift,
4.6 ± 0.4 vs 4.2 ± 0.4 μmol kg−1 min−1, p = 0.48). Post hoc
analysis suggested delayed recovery of EGP to fasting values
during the night shift (e.g. at 300 min: day shift vs night shift,
16.5 ± 2.8 vs 8.8 ± 1.1 μmol kg−1 min−1, p = 0.03), probably
due to the higher glucose concentrations present.
Neither peak (day shift vs night shift,123 ± 31 vs
69 ± 8 μmol kg−1 min−1, p = 0.10) nor integrated (day shift
vs night shift, 9.1 ± 0.9 vs 7.7 ± 0.6 mmol per 5 h, p = 0.24)
meal appearance differed between study days (Fig. 4b). Post
hoc analysis of integrated rates of meal appearance during the
first 60 min after meal ingestion did not demonstrate any dif-
ference between study days (day shift vs night shift, 3.7 ± 0.6
vs 2.7 ± 0.3 mmol per 1 h, p = 0.12).
There was also no difference in the peak (day shift vs night
shift, 132 ± 31 vs 77 ± 8 μmol kg−1 min−1, p = 0.10) or
integrated AAB (day shift vs night shift, 4.9 ± 1.0 vs
4.8 ± 0.5 mmol per 5 h, p = 0.88) for glucose disappearance
during the night shift study day compared with the day shift
(Fig. 4c). Post hoc analysis of the integrated incremental
(AAB) rates of glucose disappearance during the first
60 min after meal ingestion did not demonstrate any differ-
ence between study days (day shift vs night shift, 3.1 ± 0.5 vs
2.2 ± 0.3 mmol per 1 h, p = 0.16).
Discussion
In this study of otherwise healthy rotational shift nurses, we
demonstrate that an identical energy challenge during the
night shift study day resulted in higher postprandial glucose
concentrations compared with the day shift study day. This
was due to impaired beta cell responsivity to glucose, specif-
ically the component of beta cell responsivity (ϕs) that is
thought to represent insulin synthesis and secretion in re-
sponse to hyperglycaemia [21]. This resulted in blunted in-
creases in insulin and C-peptide concentrations during the first
hour after meal ingestion. The decreased and delayed secre-
tion of insulin observed during the night shift closely resem-
bles the pattern observed in people with impaired glucose
tolerance or diabetes [30]. Taken together, these data suggest
that during the night shift study, postprandial glucose concen-
trations were increased relative to the day shift study. This was
explained by decreased beta cell function during the night
shift study. The results are in keeping with a prior study in
which shift-work (defined as at least three night shifts per
month) significantly increased the risk of type 2 diabetes [1].
Despite changes in beta cell function, we did not observe
significant changes in meal appearance or EGP. Meal appear-
ance is altered by the rate of gastric emptying and by splanch-
nic extraction of ingested glucose. It is possible that equal and
opposite changes in either variable between study days result-
ed in no net change in meal appearance. However, in the

 absence of changes in peak rates of and time to peak meal
appearance, a change in gastric emptying induced by shift
change seems unlikely [28].
More significantly, fasting EGP was lower during the night
shift. As EGP represents the sum of gluconeogenesis and gly-
cogenolysis, future studies will be required to ascertain the
relative contribution of either process to EGP during a diurnal
cycle or in situations of circadian misalignment. The changes in
EGP were not accompanied by changes in postprandial rates of
EGP or postprandial changes in insulin action (quantified by
the minimal model as Si). Consequently, DI (which expresses
beta cell responsivity as a function of insulin action) was im-
paired during the night shift compared with the day shift.
It is possible that our experiment was underpowered to
detect small changes in glucose metabolism (despite changes
in islet function) because tracer-based measurement are limit-
ed by requiring larger numbers of participants to reliably
detect an effect on glucose metabolism [31]. An alternative
explanation is that in otherwise healthy, young non-diabetic
individuals, glucose effectiveness (i.e. the ability of glucose
per se to stimulate its own uptake and suppress its own re-
lease) is sufficiently unimpaired so that stimulation of glucose
disappearance and suppression of EGP is relatively unaffected
despite decreased insulin secretion [32]. This phenomenon
has been observed in other situations in which significant
decreases in insulin secretion are accompanied by small
changes in postprandial glucose metabolism [27].
Are these observations a direct effect of shift-work or a
maladaptive response to stressors associated with shift-work,
such as sleep deprivation or increased energy intake? The
experimental design ensured that participants experienced an
equivalent amount of sleep prior to each experiment.
Moreover, energy intake and meal composition were identical
for both study days, so these potential confounders cannot
explain the experimental results. An alternative explanation
is based on the observation that in healthy volunteers higher
postprandial glucose excursion occurs in the evening [33–35].
However, the cause is variously reported as altered insulin
secretion, insulin action or both across studies.
The study by Saad et al. used techniques similar to ours to
measure beta cell function and fasting and postprandial glucose
metabolism, while also controlling for meal size, composition
and physical activity [33]. These authors reported that beta cell
responsivity and DI were higher at breakfast than at other times
of the day, suggesting a diurnal pattern of beta cell function in
non-diabetic individuals. This was accompanied by higher
postprandial glucagon excursions after breakfast compared
with other meals. However, the significance of this particular
finding remains uncertain. In the current study, despite higher
postprandial glucose concentrations during the night shift study,
glucagon suppression was delayed compared with the day shift
study but the actual nadir values did not differ. Whether delayed
glucagon suppression is a consequence of impaired beta cell
function is uncertain. Recently, it has been associated with im-
paired insulin action [36]; however, no effect of shift change on
insulin action was observed in the current study.
It is possible that our experimental results reflect the normal
diurnal decline in beta cell function (in otherwise healthy
humans), as reported previously [33], and that 2 days of night
shift-work is insufficient to alter or invert this circadian vari-
ation. Whether our findings represent alterations in insulin
exocytosis and/or islet protein processing in the endoplasmic
reticulum remains uncertain [37, 38]. Previously, Morris et al.
simulated night shift-work with an inverted behavioural cycle
and reported higher postprandial glucose concentrations at
20:00 h than at 08:00 h, accompanied by lower insulin con-
centrations, independent of activity [39]. This agrees with our
current findings, although insulin concentrations are a poor
surrogate of insulin secretion because they represent the end
result of insulin secretion and hepatic insulin extraction [21].

 Previous epidemiological data showed that rotational shift-
workers have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus [1],
although, a more recent Danish study reported a higher risk
of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (independent of BMI)
in night shift-workers compared with both day and rotational
shift nurses over a 15 year period [40]. To date, there is a
relative dearth of studies examining glucose metabolism and
beta cell function in chronic shift-workers, and the conclu-
sions that can be drawn are limited by the design of these
studies. For example, Simon et al. examined 24 h rhythms
of glucose and insulin secretion in chronic night workers re-
ceiving continuous enteral nutrition [41]. The authors con-
cluded that these volunteers had failed to completely adapt
their 24 h rhythm of insulin secretion to their behavioural
cycle. These differences were not explained by any difference
in sleep variables, suggesting that sleep and circadian effects
alter beta cell function through separate mechanisms.
Other investigators measured glucose and insulin concentra-
tion over periods of >48 h to demonstrate the circadian rhyth-
micity of insulin secretion [13, 42]. However, these studies
used i.v. glucose infusions and did not directly measure beta
cell function in response to a meal challenge. Nevertheless,
they independently suggested diurnal variation in insulin secre-
tion, compatible with the results obtained in the current study.
In conclusion, the increase in postprandial glucose concen-
trations observed during the night shift study day is explained
by decreased beta cell function. These changes may represent
circadian variations in insulin secretory capacity driven by
changes in beta cell clock gene expression, as recently reported
[38]. Further studies will be necessary to determine the mech-
anism(s) of diurnal decline in beta cell function and whether
exposure to more prolonged patterns of chronic shift-work pro-
motes sustained or greater decreases in beta cell function.
