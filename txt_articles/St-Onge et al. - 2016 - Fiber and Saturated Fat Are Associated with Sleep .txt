Study Objectives: Sleep restriction alters food intake, but less is known about how dietary patterns affect sleep. Current goals were to determine whether: 
(1) sleep is different after consumption of a controlled diet vs. an ad libitum diet, and (2) dietary intake during ad libitum feeding is related to nocturnal sleep.
Methods: Twenty-six normal weight adults (30–45 y), habitually sleeping 7-9 h/night, participated in a randomized-crossover inpatient study with 2 phases of 
5 nights: short (4 h in bed) or habitual (9 h in bed) sleep. Only data from the habitual sleep phase were used for the present analyses. During the first 4 days, 
participants consumed a controlled diet; on day 5, food intake was self-selected. Linear regression was used to determine relations between daytime food 
intake and nighttime sleep on day 5.
Results: Sleep duration did not differ after 3 days of controlled feeding vs. a day of ad libitum intake. However, sleep after ad libitum eating had less slow 
wave sleep (SWS, P = 0.0430) and longer onset latency (P = 0.0085). Greater fiber intake predicted less stage 1 (P = 0.0198) and more SWS (P = 0.0286). 
Percent of energy from saturated fat predicted less SWS (P = 0.0422). Higher percent of energy from sugar and other carbohydrates not considered sugar or 
fiber was associated with arousals (P = 0.0320 and 0.0481, respectively).
Conclusions: Low fiber and high saturated fat and sugar intake is associated with lighter, less restorative sleep with more arousals. Diet could be useful in 
the management of sleep disorders but this needs to be tested.

INTRODUCTION
It is now well established that short sleep duration is associated 
with obesity and risk of future weight gain. Cross-sectional and 
longitudinal studies alike have demonstrated this relationship 
in both adults and children.1,2 Moreover, Grandner et al. have 
shown that total sleep time (TST) was negatively associated 
with fat intake in women.3 These associations, however, do not 
equate causality, and studies assessing the effects of sleep re-
striction on energy balance have been undertaken to elucidate 
the causation of the relationship. Clinical studies have shown 
that sleep restriction leads to increased energy intake, energy 
intake from snacks, and intake of energy-dense foods.4–10 It 
seems, therefore, that altering sleep can affect food choice and 
macronutrient intake.
Interestingly, the reverse causation, whether food choice and 
dietary patterns affect sleep, has received much less attention. 
Severe energy restriction is known to disturb sleep.11 Karklin 
et al. reported that 4 weeks of an 800-kcal diet in 9 overweight 
women increased sleep onset latency (SOL) and decreased time 
spent in slow wave sleep (SWS).12 Two days of a high-carbo-
hydrate, low-fat diet also decreased SWS and increased REM 
sleep in 8 normal-weight men compared to a 2-day diet low in 
carbohydrates, high in fat, and a balanced diet.13 More stud-
ies have assessed the effects of single meals, differing either in

size or in macronutrient composition, on post-meal sleepiness 
or nightly sleep. Such studies have shown that a high-carbohy-
drate meal increases sleepiness in women relative to a low-car-
bohydrate meal14 but does not affect SOL to a post-meal nap.15 
However, a high-glycemic index meal reduced SOL relative 
to a low-glycemic index meal, with no effect on TST or sleep 
architecture.16 Similarly, high-energy meals did not affect TST 
post-meal compared to low-energy meals.17,18
There is thus very little information on the role of diet on 
sleep patterns. Studies have been small, of short duration, and 
with no clear focus on the nighttime sleep episode. Addition-
ally, most work on the effects of diet on sleep has been based 
on epidemiological findings relying on self-report of food in-
take or on the acute effects of a single meal. It is therefore 
BRIEF SUMMARY
Current Knowledge/Study Rationale: Research has established 
a convincing link between short/disrupted sleep duration and food 
intake. Here we aimed to investigate the effects of dietary intake on 
subsequent sleep propensity, depth, and architecture.
Study Impact: Few studies have utilized controlled conditions to 
determine how food intake affects sleep. Current findings—that 
daytime fat and sugar/fiber content affect nocturnal sleep—imply 
that diet-based recommendations might be used to improve sleep in 
those with poor sleep quality.

important to have data based on direct observations of daily 
dietary intake to determine how this can affect nocturnal sleep. 
The purpose of this study, therefore, was two-fold: first, to as-
sess whether sleep patterns differed after periods of controlled 
feeding and ad libitum intake; and second, whether intake on 
an ad libitum feeding day was related to sleep patterns at night. 
We aimed to answer these questions by comparing nocturnal 
sleep after a day of a strictly controlled and balanced weight-
maintenance diet compared to a day wherein the participant 
could freely make their own food choices based on preference.
METHODS
This investigation is a secondary analysis of data from a previous 
study aimed at assessing the effects of sleep restriction on en-
ergy balance in normal sleeping adults. Details of the study and 
main results have been published.8,19,20 Briefly, 30- to 45-year-
old men and women, with body mass index 22–26 kg/m2, and 
who reported sleeping 7–9 h/night with no daytime naps, were 
recruited for this study. Some exclusion criteria included shift 
work or any work that required frequent travel across time zones, 
metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular dis-
ease, and hypertension, smoking, and eating disorders, sleeping 
disorders, or neurological disorders. Further exclusion criteria 
included the use of medication, including benzodiazepines, an-
tidepressants, and other medications for insomnia. The pres-
ence of sleep disorders, excessive daytime sleepiness, and poor 
sleep quality were also exclusionary, and were assessed with the 
Sleep Disorders Inventory Questionnaire, Epworth Sleepiness 
Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, respectively. Finally, 
recordings from the first night’s polysomnographic (PSG) moni-
toring were analyzed to exclude participants with obstructive 
sleep apnea or periodic leg movement disorder. One participant 
was excluded for periodic limb movement disorder after the 
first phase of the study, and one participant was excluded for 
use of antidepressant medication prior to starting the study. Par-
ticipants were screened by actigraphy over a 2-week period to 
ensure normal sleep duration of 7–9 h/night. To exclude partici-
pants with habitual short sleep, the mean sleep duration over 14 
nights was required to fall between 7 and 9 h/night, with ≥ 10 
nights of sleep of ≥ 7 h and < 4 nights with < 6 h of sleep. The 
study was approved by St. Luke’s/Roosevelt Hospital Institu-
tional Review Board and Columbia University Medical Center 
Institutional Review Board. All participants provided informed 
consent after being given information about the study and hav-
ing the opportunity to ask questions.
Once enrolled, participants were randomly assigned to one 
of 2 intervention phases: restricted or habitual sleep. During the 
short sleep phase, participants were limited to 4 h time in bed, at 
01:00–05:00; during the habitual sleep phase, participants spent 9 
h in bed, from 22:00 to 07:00. Participants were tested under both 
conditions, in a crossover design, with a 3-week washout period 
separating each phase. Each intervention phase was 6 days in du-
ration. During this time, participants were inpatients at Clinilabs, 
a sleep research facility in midtown Manhattan (New York, NY).
The first 4 days of each intervention were performed under 
controlled feeding conditions; the last 2 days were done under ad 
libitum feeding conditions. Meals for both phases were served at 
08:00 (breakfast), noon (lunch), 16:30 (snack), and 19:00 (dinner). 
Meal times and eating occasions were not controlled during the 
ad libitum days. The controlled diet provided approximately 31% 
of energy from fat (approximately 7.5% from saturated fat), 53% 
of energy from carbohydrates, and 17% of energy from protein. 
Energy requirements were calculated for each participant using 
the Harris-Benedict equation.21 Each meal provided 30% of daily 
energy requirements and the snack provided the remaining 10%. 
Meals were assembled and prepared at the Bionutrition Unit of 
the Columbia University Irving Institute for Clinical and Transla-
tional Research (New York, NY). For the ad libitum feeding days, 
participants were given a monetary allowance ($25) to purchase 
foods and beverages of their choice to consume in the lab on days 
5 and 6. Participants were told that they could purchase any item 
for which the nutrient content was readily available. Caffeine in-
take throughout the study was limited to one coffee beverage per 
day, with breakfast. Food intake on days 5 and 6 was assessed 
by weighing foods pre- and post-consumption. Macronutrient in-
take was determined using Diet Analysis Plus software, version 
8.0 (Wadsworth, Florence, KY).8
Sleep was assessed every night in the lab using PSG, as pre-
viously described.22 Participants slept, on average, 3 h 46 min 
during the short sleep phase and 7 h 35 min in the habitual 
sleep phase. Because of the high sleep efficiency in the short 
sleep phase, only data from the habitual sleep phase were used 
for the present analyses. Sleep data from night 3, after 3 days 
of controlled feeding, and night 5, after one day of ad libitum 
food intake, were analyzed. Data from night 4 were not used 
because this was a night of nocturnal blood sampling, and the 
presence of a catheter may have disturbed sleep. In addition, 
food intake on day 4 was modified from previous days because 
an oral glucose tolerance test was performed in the morning, 
in lieu of the regular breakfast. Finally, participants were dis-
charged on the evening of day 6, and no sleep data are available 
for that day. Therefore, day 5 is the only day when self-selected 
food intake was measured before a night of PSG sleep monitor-
ing. Sleep scoring was conducted according to AASM 2007 
criteria23 by a single certified benchmark scorer.
Statistical Analyses
Linear mixed-model repeated measure analysis (with an inter-
cept/slope term, which was tested) was used to compare dif-
ferences in the amounts of PSG sleep architecture parameters 
obtained on night 3 vs. night 5 during the habitual sleep du-
ration condition. In particular, sleep parameters investigated 
included TST, SOL, number of arousals, and the amounts of 
stage 1 sleep, stage 2 sleep, SWS, and REM sleep, expressed 
in absolute minutes and as a percentage of TST. Night (5 vs. 3), 
sex, and phase order were included as independent variables, 
and participant ID as grouping variable. Linear model analysis 
was also used to assess the relationship between food intake 
parameters from day 5 and PSG-assessed sleep variables from 
night 5; dietary variables including percent of energy from 
protein, sugar, non-fiber/non-sugar carbohydrates, unsaturated 
fat, and saturated fat, and grams of fiber were designated as in-
dependent predictor variables, with TST, sleep stages (minutes 
and percentage of stage 1 sleep, stage 2 sleep, SWS, and REM

as outcome variables. These models included sex and phase 
order as covariates. Data are expressed as mean ± SD. A p 
value < 0.05 was used to define statistical significance.
RESULTS
Data describing our research participants have been previously 
published.8 Briefly, 14 men and 13 women completed the study 
and one man was excluded from these analyses since he was 
considered an outlier based on his food intake data. A CON-
SORT diagram representing the flow of participants through-
out the study was previously published.24 Participants were 
on average 35.1 ± 5.1 y of age and had a body mass index of 
23.5 ± 1.3 kg/m2. All participants had at least some college 
education; 12 were white, 5 were black, 6 were Hispanic, and 3 
had other or mixed racial background.
Sleep Differences between Night 3 and Night 5
There were no differences in TST and absolute time spent 
in stage 1, stage 2, and REM sleep between nights 3 and 5 
(Table 1). However, night 5 was associated with reduced ab-
solute and percent time spent in SWS (p = 0.0430 and 0.0565, 
respectively) after adjusting for sex and phase order. Latency 
to the first 10 min of sleep was longer on night 5 than night 3 
(p = 0.0085). Looking at individual data, a total of 9 partici-
pants (35% of sample) who initially had a SOL < 30 min on 
night 3 demonstrated an increase in SOL to > 30 min on night 
5. No differences in sleep duration and architecture, except for 
arousals, were observed between men and women; men had 
more arousals than women (p = 0.011).
Relationship between Diet and Sleep Parameters on 
Night 5
Energy intake on day 5 has been previously reported.8 In 
short, participants consumed significantly more energy on 
day 5 during the short vs. habitual sleep condition.24 Partici-
pants obtained approximately 14% of their energy intake from 
protein, 54.6% from carbohydrates, and 32.7% from fat (10% 
from saturated fat). Diet was not related to TST on night 5 
(Table 2). However, fiber intake was associated with reduced 
time spent in stage 1 sleep (absolute time: p = 0.023; percent of 
TST: p = 0.020). Conversely, fiber intake was associated with 
greater time spent in SWS (absolute time: p = 0.039; percent 
of TST: p = 0.029). Percent energy consumed from saturated 
fat was associated with reduced time in SWS (absolute time: 
p = 0.031; percent of TST: p = 0.042). Arousals on night 5 were

DISCUSSION
This study shows that diet can influence nighttime sleep pro-
pensity, depth, and architecture. First, we report differences in 
nocturnal sleep after a 3-day controlled feeding period com-
pared to one day of ad libitum, self-selected food consump-
tion. Then, using regression analyses, we observed significant 
relationships between daytime intake of fiber and saturated fat 
on sleep depth. Ad libitum food intake was associated with a 
decrease in SWS and an increase in SOL. Indeed, over a third 
of participants increased their SOL to over 30 min after the ad 
libitum feeding day. This finding is clinically relevant since 
the 30-min SOL threshold is typically used as a cut-point to 
indicate sleep onset insomnia.25 A greater intake of saturated 
fat and lower intake of fiber were associated with a lighter, 
less deep sleep profile. Additionally, increased intake of both 
sugar and non-sugar/non-fiber carbohydrates was associated 
with more nocturnal arousals during sleep. These results are 
important since there is currently very little information on 
the role of diet on sleep, and dietary recommendations for life-
style management of sleep disorders are lacking.
Our results show that higher saturated fat intake through-
out the day was associated with a lesser amount of SWS at 
night. This is in contrast with a small study by Phillips et 
al.13 that showed less SWS after a 2-day consumption pe-
riod of a high-carbohydrate/low-fat diet compared to a low-
carbohydrate/high-fat diet in 8 healthy, normal-weight men. 
More recently, Crispim et al.26 reported that high fat intake, 
specifically at dinner and later in the evening, was related to 
lower sleep efficiency, greater time to the first REM episode, 
greater sleep time spent in stage 2 sleep with less time spent 
in REM sleep, and greater time spent awake after having 
fallen asleep (wake after sleep onset). Of note is that the study 
by Crispim and colleagues included a relatively large num-
ber of men and women (25 and 27, respectively), and food 
intake was assessed over a 3-day period via self-reported 
food diaries prior to the sleep assessment. Moreover, partici-
pants reported a macronutrient intake profile similar to that 
of the controlled diet in the present study. Participants were 
younger than those enrolled in our study but had similar body 
mass index. A limitation of those studies is their self-report 
nature, leading to potentially erroneous data,27 and failure to 
report on the type of fat consumed. Differences in fat type, 
saturated or unsaturated, may explain some of the discrepan-
cies between studies. Our data, on the other hand, are based 
on direct observations of dietary intake.
Our data also revealed an association between percent of 
energy consumed from sugar and non-sugar/non-fiber carbo-
hydrates throughout the day and nighttime arousals. A recent 
epidemiological study by Yamaguchi et al.28 showed greater 
odds of poor sleep-wake regularity in those with the highest 
reported intake of carbohydrates compared to moderate car-
bohydrate consumption (≥ 70.7% of energy vs. 61% to 66%, 
respectively). On the other hand, high carbohydrate intake 
was associated with reduced odds of having difficulty main-
taining sleep in the 2007–2008 NHANES dataset.29 Spring et 
al.14 found that women reported feeling more sleepy, and men 
more calm, after a high carbohydrate meal (86% of energy 
from carbohydrates) compared to a high protein meal (85% 
of energy from protein), although subsequent nocturnal sleep 
was not reported. Along the same lines, Afaghi et al.16 found 
that participants tended to feel sleepier and less awake af-
ter a high glycemic index compared to a low glycemic index 
evening meal. In that study, sleep onset latency was 8.5 min 
shorter after the high glycemic index meal compared to the 
low glycemic index meal, but TST and sleep architecture and 
quality, including arousal index, were not different between 
conditions.
An effect on the circadian system may be one speculative 
explanation for the current finding of an association between 
carbohydrate intake and worsened nocturnal sleep. For exam-
ple, a carbohydrate-rich meal in the evening was found to de-
lay the circadian rhythm of core body temperature and reduce 
nocturnal melatonin secretion.30 This is relevant, since sleep 
propensity and quality are highest near the declining limb 
of the core body temperature curve when melatonin levels 
are increased.31,32 Although body temperature and melatonin 
were not recorded in the current study, these effects would 
be consistent with an increase in SOL on night 5 and the as-
sociation with nocturnal arousals observed here. Conversely, 
fiber intake is associated with deeper, more restorative sleep. 
Therefore, it is possible that a diet rich in fiber, with reduced 
intake of sugars and other non-fiber carbohydrates, may be 
a useful tool to improve sleep depth and architecture in in-
dividuals with poor sleep. This hypothesis requires further 
investigation.
There is a large body of evidence showing a relationship 
between sleep and food intake. For example, Grandner et 
al.3 showed that sleep duration, assessed by actigraphy, was 
negatively correlated with fat intake, and subjective nap-
ping, positively correlated with fat intake, in women from 
the Women’s Health Initiative. On the other hand, a report 
from the same group using National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Survey (NHANES) data showed lower intake of 
fats and carbohydrates among very short and long sleepers 
compared to normal sleepers.33 These results conflict with 
data from clinical intervention studies that report increased 
carbohydrate and fat intake when participants are forced to 
curtail their sleep by 2 to 4 h,5,7,9,24 and the findings of another 
epidemiological study which reported greater consumption 
of carbohydrates and lower consumption of fiber in short 
sleepers than individuals obtaining sufficient sleep dura-
tion.34 The NHANES study only used one survey round of 
data (2007–2008) rather than multiple survey years, which 
may cause unreliable statistical estimates.35 Additionally, 
the cross-sectional design, self-reported sleep, and one-day 
self-reported 24-h recall of dietary data from one cycle pre-
vent conclusions on the direction of the relationship and the 
implications of causality. We and others have reported that 
alterations in sleep architecture may affect components of 
energy balance and hunger.22,36 There is likely a feed-forward 
 23
Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine, Vol. 12, No. 1, 2016
MP St-Onge, A Robers, A Shechter et al. Fat and Carbohydrate Intake Affect Sleep
mechanism whereby food intake patterns affect sleep archi-
tecture, which then further affects decision-making relative 
to food intake and leads to alterations in dietary consump-
tion patterns. This, however, could not be tested using the 
data obtained in the present study since we only had one day 
of free-living energy intake and one night of PSG-assessed 
sleep under ad libitum feeding conditions.
Our study had several strengths, including the controlled 
nature of the study and therefore lack of bias due to self-re-
port of dietary intake and sleep. On the other hand, data were 
obtained in the artificial setting of the laboratory. This limita-
tion was somewhat mitigated by providing participants with a 
monetary allowance to purchase foods that they wanted to eat 
during the ad libitum feeding day. Another important aspect 
of this study is that ad libitum intake measurements were ob-
tained after a 4-day period of controlled feeding, such that all 
participants had similar prior food exposure. However, our 
ad libitum measurement period was only for a single day. It is 
therefore unknown whether the associations observed in the 
current study represent transient acute effects of a change in 
dietary intake or whether they would persist with continued 
exposure and consumption of this dietary pattern. Moreover, 
the inpatient design of the study necessarily restricted physi-
cal activity and exercise opportunities in participants. This 
could have potentially affected some sleep parameters within 
the current report, as exercise is known to improve SWS and 
SOL in particular.37 However, the current reported differ-
ences in SWS and SOL occurred between night 3 and night 
5 on the habitual sleep condition, when physical activity was 
relatively constant. This implies that changes in food intake, 
as opposed to changes in exercise or fatigue associated with 
the sleep intervention, are likely to be driving the results on 
SWS and SOL. Finally, the study would be strengthened by 
the inclusion of a morning sleep diary to evaluate subjective 
sleep quality of the preceding sleep episode. This could bet-
ter contextualize the observations and ramifications of de-
creased SWS and increased SOL observed after ad libitum 
feeding compared to controlled feeding.
Future studies are needed to evaluate the role of diet on 
sleep. Emerging epidemiological evidence, along with the 
results of the present analysis, suggest that dietary patterns 
with differing fat and sugar/fiber content in particular, may 
affect nocturnal sleep depth, propensity, and architecture. 
However, further testing is needed to determine causality. 
If this is the case, then diet-based recommendations may be 
warranted for those who suffer from sleep disorders, includ-
ing insomnia, short sleep duration, and poor overall sleep 
quality. Current findings also have clinical applications for 
patients undergoing dietary-based therapies. Specifically, a 
high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet has been promoted 
as a therapeutic option for several neurological disorders in-
cluding Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and epilepsy.38 
These dietary alterations may be associated with changes in 
nocturnal sleep, and indeed, insomnia has been reported 
in response to a ketogenic diet.39 Therefore, increasing our 
understanding of the impact of dietary intake on nocturnal 
sleep will have many important and practical ramifications 
for public health.
