BACKGROUND: Although larger social networks have been associated with lower all-cause mortality, few studies have examined
whether social integration predicts survival outcomes among patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). The authors examined the associ-
ation between social ties and survival after CRC diagnosis in a prospective cohort study. METHODS: Participants included 896 women
in the Nurses’ Health Study who were diagnosed with stage I, II, or III CRC between 1992 and 2012. Stage was assigned using the
American Joint Committee on Cancer criteria. Social integration was assessed every 4 years since 1992 using the Berkman-Syme
Social Network Index, which included marital status, social network size, contact frequency, religious participation, and other social
group participation. RESULTS: During follow-up, there were 380 total deaths, 167 of which were due to CRC. In multivariable analyses,
women who were socially integrated before diagnosis had a subsequent reduced risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.65;
95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.46-0.92) and CRC mortality (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.38-1.06) compared with women who were
socially isolated. In particular, women with more intimate ties (family and friends) had lower all-cause mortality (HR, 0.61; 95% CI,
0.42-0.88) and CRC mortality (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.34-1.03) compared with those with few intimate ties. Participation in religious or
community activities was not found to be related to outcomes. The analysis of postdiagnosis social integration yielded similar results.
CONCLUSIONS: Socially integrated women were found to have better survival after a diagnosis of CRC, possibly due to beneficial
caregiving from their family and friends. Interventions aimed at strengthening social network structures to ensure access to care may
be valuable programmatic tools in the management of patients with CRC. Cancer 2018;124:833-40. V

INTRODUCTION
Over 4 decades of research have established that stronger social relationships predict lower all-cause mortality,1-4 and the
health risks associated with social isolation are comparable to those of traditional risk factors such as smoking, blood pres-
sure, and obesity.3,5 Large social networks may improve survival through biological pathways, including neuroendocrine
and immunologic changes that influence tumor progression, and through increased instrumental support, including assis-
tance in getting to medical appointments, reminders to take medications, and help with nutrition and mobility.1,6,7
Greater social integration, defined as participation in a broad range of intimate and extended social relationships,6,8 has
been associated with lower overall mortality in healthy populations2 and in disease-specific populations, particularly
patients with breast cancer.9-15 However, few studies to date have examined this association in other cancer sites.7
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer
death in the United States.16 Although marital status has been shown to predict CRC-specific and all-cause mortality
among patients with CRC,17,18 less is known regarding the association between social integration and mortality among
these individuals.19-21 In what, to our knowledge, is the only study published to date that examined this association,
Goodwin et al20 did not find a relationship between postdiagnosis social integration and all-cause mortality in 211
patients with CRC who were followed for up to 10 years. However, their study was limited by a small sample and a lack of
information regarding CRC-specific mortality. Given the knowledge gap due to the paucity of research, more studies are

 needed to determine the potential influence of social rela-
tionships on CRC survival outcomes, which would
inform a general effect of social networks.7
Therefore, we examined the association between
social integration and all-cause and CRC-specific mortal-
ity among 896 patients with CRC with up to 22 years of
follow-up in the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS). Given the
theorized health benefits of stronger social networks, we
hypothesized that greater social integration would be asso-
ciated with better survival after a diagnosis of CRC. We
also examined whether social-emotional support, as indi-
cated by the presence and availability of a confidant,11,22
was associated with outcomes, because one study found
that low social support was associated with a higher risk of
CRC mortality in Japanese men but not women.22 How-
ever, some evidence has suggested that having a large
social network is more predictive of survival among
patients with cancer than social support.14
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
The NHS is a prospective cohort study of 121,700 female
nurses in the United States who were aged 30 to 55 years
when the study began in 1976. Since then, participants
have received biennial mailed questionnaires regarding
their medical and health behavior history, with each
follow-up having at least a 90% response rate. Questions
regarding social networks were added in 1992, which we
considered baseline in this study, and information was
subsequently collected in 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, and
2012. The study population consisted of 896 women who
were diagnosed with stage I, II, or III colorectal adenocar-
cinoma between 1992 and 2012 and who responded to
social integration questions before diagnosis. Women
who had a prior cancer diagnosis other than nonmela-
noma skin cancer were excluded. Among these 896
women who had prediagnosis measurements of social
integration, 668 women completed social integration
questions after diagnosis and were included in postdiag-
nosis analyses. Participants were followed until death or
June 30, 2014, whichever occurred first. The institutional
review board of Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Bos-
ton, Massachusetts approved the study, and all study par-
ticipants provided written informed consent.
Measures
Measurement of social integration
Social integration was measured every 4 years since 1992
using the Berkman-Syme Social Network Index (SNI).23
This 7-item index is a composite measure of 4 types of
social connection: 1) marital status; 2) frequency and
number of contacts with close relatives and friends; 3) reli-
gious service attendance; and 4) participation in other
social groups. The responses to these items yield a total
score ranging from 1 to 12 that typically is analyzed as a 4-
level categorical variable ranging from I (socially isolated)
to IV (socially integrated). The validity of the SNI has
been demonstrated previously.24-26 Women in the lowest
category of social integration (the most socially isolated)
were the reference group. In addition, we examined social
network changes before and after diagnosis. Women were
defined as having declining or increasing networks versus
no change (reference group).
We also considered the association between out-
comes and both intimate ties, including marriage and
close relatives and friends (sociability), and extended ties,
including participation in religious and other social
groups.27,28 The intimate ties scores ranged from I (not
married and low sociability) to III (married and high
sociability), and the extended ties scores ranged from I (no
religious or other social group participation) to IV (both
religious and other social group participation).
Measurement of social-emotional support
Similar to Kroenke et al,11 we assessed prediagnosis social-
emotional support using 2 items: the presence and avail-
ability of a confidant. Women were asked whether they
have a close confidant (yes or no) and if so, how often they
talk with their confidant. We created an indicator variable
from these 2 questions. Categories included: no confidant
(reference group), communicate with confidant once per
month or less, communicate with confidant more than
once per month but less often than once per week, com-
municate with confidant more than once per week but
less often than once per day, and communicate with confi-
dant once per day or more. Questions were asked in 1992
and every 4 years thereafter until 2012, with the exception
of 1996. The correlation between the presence and avail-
ability of a confidant and social integration was low (cor-
relation coefficient, .09; P<.01).
Measurement of CRC
On biennial mailed questionnaires, participants were
asked to self-report diagnoses, including CRC. With par-
ticipant permission, physicians blinded to exposure infor-
mation reviewed medical and pathology records to
confirm incident CRC and abstract information regard-
ing the cancer’s anatomic location, stage, and histologic
type. CRC was defined according to the International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). CRC

 was classified further into colon cancer (ICD-9 codes
153.0-153.4 and 153.6-153.9) and rectal cancer (ICD-9
codes 154.0 or 154.1). Stage was assigned according to
the American Joint Committee on Cancer criteria.29
Measurement of mortality
Deaths were ascertained using reports from family or
postal authorities and the US National Death Index,
which has been shown to have 98% sensitivity and 100%
specificity for death ascertainment.30 The date of death
was determined from death certificates, and physician
reviewers classified individual causes of death. Based on
cause of death, we defined CRC mortality as death from
CRC and all-cause mortality as death from any cause.
Measurement of covariates
Biomedical and lifestyle factors, including body mass
index (BMI), smoking, and aspirin use, have been self-
reported biennially. Physical activity and diet have been
self-reported every 4 years.
Statistical Analyses
Participants contributed person-years from the date of
diagnosis until death or the end of follow-up (June 30,
2014), whichever came first. Follow-up ranged from 0 to
22 years, with a median of 9.5 years. Cox proportional
hazards models were used to assess associations between
social networks most recent to and before diagnosis with
time to CRC death and all-cause mortality. We focused
on the analysis of social networks before diagnosis to
increase power, ensure appropriate time order of expo-
sures and outcomes, and avoid biases that may occur if
women with late-stage disease are less likely to fill out later
social network questionnaires.11 This is particularly
appropriate because social networks tended to be stable
from before to after CRC diagnosis (correlation coeffi-
cient, .69; P<.001 in the current study sample). We also
examined postdiagnosis social networks and prediagnosis
to postdiagnosis changes in social networks in relation to
outcomes. In addition, we assessed the association
between the presence and availability of a confidant before
diagnosis and outcomes. We did not examine changes in
the presence and availability of a confidant because it was
not measured at all time points. We tested the propor-
tional hazards assumption by likelihood ratio tests com-
paring models with and without interaction terms of age
with the predictors, and observed no evidence of
violation.
We modeled the medians within each category of
social integration to test for linear trends across the
categories. Initial models were adjusted for age at the time
of diagnosis. We compared these initial models with a sec-
ond set of models that were adjusted for the following: age
at diagnosis (continuous), date of diagnosis (continuous),
race/ethnicity (white, black, or other), smoking status
(never, past, or current), alcohol intake (none, 0.1 to <5,
5 to <15, or �15 g/d), aspirin use (nonuser vs current
user), physical activity (quintiles), and BMI (<21, 21 to
<23, 23 to <25, 25 to <29, or �29 kg/m2). We further
adjusted for cancer stage (I, II, or III), histologic grade
(well differentiated, moderately, poorly, or missing/
unknown), and cancer site (proximal colon, distal colon,
rectum, or missing/unknown) to assess the association
independent of these strong predictors of survival. For
prediagnosis analysis, information regarding social inte-
gration, smoking, alcohol intake, aspirin use, physical
activity, and BMI was taken from the questionnaires clos-
est in time before diagnosis. For postdiagnosis analysis,
variables were taken from the questionnaires closest in
time after diagnosis. In addition, we used Kaplan-Meier
curves and the log-rank test to compare CRC-specific and
overall
mortality
according
to
social
integration
categories.
We also conducted stratified analyses by age at diag-
nosis, BMI, stage of disease, and cancer site. Interaction
terms were computed based on the cross-product of each
dichotomized stratification variable and the continuous
social integration variable. When analyses suggested dif-
ferences in associations across strata, we evaluated interac-
tion terms using Wald chi-square tests. All statistical
analyses were performed with SAS statistical software (ver-
sion 9.4; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina). All
significance tests were 2-sided, and P<.05 was considered
statistically significant.
RESULTS
Between 1992 and 2012, a total of 896 women were diag-
nosed with CRC. Characteristics of women diagnosed
with CRC, according to their social integration category
before diagnosis, are provided in Table 1. Approximately
10.7% of participants (96 participants) were in the lowest
category of social integration before diagnosis, whereas
33.4% (299 participants) were in the highest category of
social integration. Compared with the most socially inte-
grated women, socially isolated women were more likely
to be current smokers and were less physically active.
Among the 896 women diagnosed with CRC
between 1992 and 2012, there were 380 total deaths, 167
of which were due to CRC. Social integration before diag-
nosis was associated with a significant reduction in overall

 ties (ie, being married and having a large number of
friends or relatives who were seen frequently) was associ-
ated with lower all-cause mortality (HR, 0.61; 95% CI,
0.42-0.88) and CRC-specific mortality (HR, 0.59; 95%
CI, 0.34-1.03). In addition, being married was found to
be significantly associated with lower all-cause mortality
(HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.61-0.95). Extended social ties (reli-
gious service attendance and other social group participa-
tion) were found to be unrelated to outcomes.
In stratified analyses, high social integration before
diagnosis was significantly associated with reduced all-
cause (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.25-0.63) and CRC-specific
(HR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.16-0.73) mortality among women
aged >70 years (the mean age at diagnosis) but not among
those who were younger, although the interaction term
was found to be statistically significant for all-cause mor-
tality only (P 5 .03) (see Supporting Information Table
1). No statistically significant interactions were observed
for BMI, stage of disease, or cancer site.
Effect estimates from analyses of postdiagnosis social
integration and outcomes were similar to those from pre-
diagnosis analyses. High social integration after diagnosis
was associated with reduced all-cause (HR, 0.57; 95% CI,
0.37-0.88 [P for trend 5 .0.03]) and CRC-specific (HR,
0.53; 95% CI, 0.25-1.15 [P for trend 5 .19]) mortality
compared with low social integration (see Supporting
Information Table 2).
The presence and availability of a confidant was not
found to be associated with all-cause or CRC-specific
mortality (data not shown). The majority of women
(64%) had no change in social networks from before to
after diagnosis (see Supporting Information Table 3).
Compared with women whose social networks did not
change, those whose networks declined had a higher,
albeit not statistically significant, risk of all-cause mortal-
ity (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.94-1.73) and CRC-specific
mortality (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.73-2.21). Women whose
social networks increased had a reduced risk of all-cause
mortality (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.48-1.10) and CRC-
specific mortality (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.20-0.92). How-
ever, from before to after diagnosis, only 8% of women
had a decrease and 3% had an increase of >1 level.

levels of social integration before a diagnosis of CRC were

 found to have a significantly reduced risk of all-cause and
CRC-specific mortality, particularly among older women.
Although the presence and availability of a confidant and
the number of extended ties were not associated with sur-
vival, having more intimate ties was associated with a sig-
nificantly lower death rate. Effect estimates were similar
in analyses of postdiagnosis social networks. Women
whose social networks increased from before to after diag-
nosis were found to have a significantly reduced risk of
CRC-specific mortality.
To our knowledge, only 1 study to date has exam-
ined the association between social integration, as mea-
sured by the SNI, and mortality among patients with
CRC,20 and it did not find an association between post-
diagnosis social integration and overall survival (HR, 1.1;
95% CI, 0.6-1.9). However, this study was relatively
small (211 patients with CRC). In comparison, the cur-
rent study had more patients and adjusted for additional
confounding factors, including CRC severity.
Several pathways were proposed through which
social networks may confer improved survival among
patients with cancer. Some research has demonstrated
that higher levels of social integration were associated with
lower levels of proinflammatory markers, such as interleu-
kin-6,6,31 which may directly influence disease progres-
sion. In addition, social relationships may reduce
psychosocial stress and thereby affect cancer progression
by altering the release of glucocorticoids from the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and catecholamines
from the sympathetic nervous system, both of which
modulate tumor progression.32,33 Moreover, animal
models have shown that chronic stress promoted CRC
tumor growth and metastasis.34,35 In addition, social net-
works may influence survival among patients with cancer
through the provision of instrumental social support
before diagnosis (eg, prompting preventive health care)
and after diagnosis (eg, assistance in getting to medical
appointments and adhering to medical regimens).6,7
Social networks also may indirectly affect disease progres-
sion by influencing health behavior, such as smoking
behavior, physical activity patterns, and cancer screening
behavior. Socially isolated individuals may be more likely
to engage in poor health behaviors, thereby precipitating
cancer progression and its related mortality.14
When we examined the types of social ties, we found
that having more intimate ties was associated with better
survival among women with a CRC diagnosis, whereas
having more extended ties was not associated with out-
comes. Specifically, being married was associated with a
significantly
reduced
all-cause
mortality,
which
is
consistent with other studies among patients with CRC
that have found that being married predicts a lower mor-
tality risk.17,18,36 In the current study sample of women
diagnosed with CRC in the NHS, it is possible that wom-
en’s spouses acted as their caregivers, providing women
with instrumental support (eg, rides to the hospital,
reminders to take medications) that may have improved
survival outcomes.1,6,7 In addition, it has been suggested
that the quality of emotional support supplied by a social
network, such as that provided by a close confidant, is
important for survival.7,10,22 However, we did not find
that the presence and availability of a confidant was associ-
ated with overall or CRC survival.
The results of the current study also demonstrated
that the association between social integration and sur-
vival was present among older women only. It is unclear
why older women might have derived a greater benefit
from their social networks compared with younger
women. A possible explanation is that older women may
be more likely to receive instrumental support from their
spouses, who may be retired and have the time and resour-
ces to provide care. Indeed, a study of patients with breast
cancer found that marriage had a stronger association
with all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality among
older white women compared with younger white
women.12
The current study also has limitations. In general,
the NHS lacks diversity with regard to race/ethnicity and
socioeconomic status,37 which may limit the generaliz-
ability of its results to other populations. In addition,
because the NHS includes only women, we were unable
to examine whether sex modifies the association between
social integration and CRC survival, and marital status
has been shown to have a stronger inverse association with
CRC survival in men compared with women.36 More-
over, because having a confidant is a limited proxy for
emotional support from social contacts, we cannot rule
out the possibility that social-emotional support may
influence survival.
The results of the current study demonstrated that
socially integrated women had better survival after a diag-
nosis of CRC, possibly due to beneficial caregiving from
their family and friends. At the time of diagnosis, health
care providers may assess a woman’s social networks to
determine whether these networks provide necessary
resources and whether external help (eg, assistance from
social workers) is needed to ensure access to care. Inter-
ventions aimed at strengthening social network structures
may be valuable programmatic tools in the management
of patients with CRC.
