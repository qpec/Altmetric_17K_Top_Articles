 describe the development of a novel anti-leishmanial drug-like chemical series based on a 
pyrazolopyrimidine scaffold. The leading compound from this series (7, DDD853651/
GSK3186899) is efficacious in a mouse model of VL, has suitable physicochemical, 
pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties for further development and has been declared a 
preclinical candidate. Detailed mode of action studies indicate that compounds from this series act 
principally by inhibiting the parasite cdc-2-related kinase 12 (CRK12), thus defining a novel, 
druggable, target for VL.
Introduction
Leishmania parasites cause a wide spectrum of human infections ranging from the life-
threatening visceral disease to disfiguring mucosal and cutaneous forms. Leishmania spp. 
are obligate intracellular parasites of the vertebrate reticuloendothelial system, where they 
multiply as amastigotes within macrophage phagolysosomes; transmission is by blood-
sucking sandflies, in which they proliferate as extracellular promastigotes.
Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), resulting from infection with Leishmania donovani and L. 
infantum, causes more than 30,000 deaths annually, of which ~60% occur in India, 
Bangladesh and Nepal1. In 95% of cases, death can be prevented by timely and appropriate 
drug therapy2. However, current treatment options are far from ideal with outcomes 
dependent upon a number of factors including geographical location, the immune status and 
other co-morbidities of the patient, and the disease classification. None of the current front-
line treatments for VL, amphotericin B (liposomal or deoxycholate formulations), 
miltefosine, paromomycin and antimonials, are ideal for use in resource poor settings, due to 
issues such as teratogenicity, cost, resistance and / or clinical relapse, prolonged treatment 
regimens and parenteral administration3–5. Thus, there is an urgent need for new treatment 
options for VL, particularly oral drugs. Unfortunately, there are currently no new 
therapeutics in clinical development and only a few in preclinical development. There is a 
paucity of well-validated molecular drug targets in Leishmania, and the molecular targets of 
the current clinical molecules are unknown. Recent studies6 identified the proteasome as a 
promising therapeutic target for treatment of VL as well as other kinetoplastid infections, 
and this currently represents the most robustly validated drug target in these parasites. 
Furthermore, whole cell (phenotypic) screening programs have been hindered by extremely 
low hit rates7. Here, we report the discovery of a promising new anti-leishmanial compound 
with a novel mechanism of action.
Discovery
Previously, we reported the identification of a diaminothiazole series from a compound 
screen against Trypanosoma brucei GSK3 kinase (TbGSK3)8. During compound 
optimization it became clear that the anti-trypanosomal activity of the series was driven, at 
least in part, by off-target activity. The early compounds showed activity against T. brucei 
bloodstream trypanosomes in viability assays, but showed little activity against L. donovani 
axenic amastigotes (e.g. compound 1). Modification of the core structure, whilst retaining 
hydrogen bond donor and acceptor functionalities, gave a bicyclic compound series (Fig. 1),

 one of which (compound 2), showed very weak activity against L. donovani axenic 
amastigotes, but was inactive against the clinically relevant intra-macrophage amastigotes. 
Appending a sulfonamide to the cyclohexyl ring resulted in compound 3, active against L. 
donovani amastigotes in both the axenic and intra-macrophage assays9,10 and selectively 
active against L. donovani compared to the THP-1 mammalian host cells used in the assay. 
Replacement of the iso-butyl substituent on the pyrazole ring with an aromatic substituent 
and the benzyl group on the sulfonamide with a trifluoropropyl substituent resulted in 
compound 4 which had marginally more activity. Critically this compound demonstrated 
>70% parasite reduction in a mouse model of VL when dosed orally, providing proof of 
concept in an animal model for this series. Replacing the pyridyl group with a 2-
methoxyphenyl and the trifluoropropyl group with an iso-butyl group gave our most potent 
compound 5, which had an EC50 of 0.014 μM in the intra-macrophage assay. Compound 5 
was metabolically unstable, although it demonstrated >95% parasite reduction when dosed 
in a HRN™ hepatic CYP450 null mouse model of infection11. Furthermore, the solubility 
of compounds 4 and 5 was poor.
The 2-methoxyphenyl group of 5 was replaced by a morpholine (compound 6) to increase 
polarity, increase the 3-dimensional shape (sp3 character) and reduce the number of 
aromatic rings. This was substituted with a 2-methyl group to further reduce the planarity 
and the trifluoropropyl sulfonamide was re-introduced, to give the key compound 
DDD853651 / GSK3186899 (compound 7)12. This compound was selected as our 
preclinical candidate, on the basis of the overall properties of the molecule (potency, efficacy 
in the mouse model, pharmacokinetics and safety profile).
Compound 7 was active against L. donovani in an intra-macrophage assay9 with an EC50 of 
1.4 μM (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.2-1.5 μM, n=12) and showed good selectivity 
against mammalian THP-1 cells (EC50 >50 μM). This is not as potent as our reported data 
for amphotericin B (EC50 of 0.07 μM in the intra-macrophage assay), but is comparable to 
the clinically used drugs miltefosine and paromomycin (EC50 values of 0.9 μM and 6.6 μM, 
respectively)9. Compound 7 was also active in our cidal axenic amastigote assay (EC50 0.1 
μM (95% CI 0.06-0.17 μM, n=4)10. At a concentration of 0.2 μM, compound 7 was 
cytocidal at 96 h; increasing the concentration to 1.8 μM reduced this to 48 h (Extended 
Data Fig. 1). Compound 7 demonstrated a less than 10-fold variation in potency against a 
panel of Leishmania clinical-derived lines. The compound was also more active in a panel of 
Leishmania lines using human peripheral mononuclear cells as host cells (Extended Data 
Table 1).
A balance between solubility in relevant physiological media (Extended Data Table 2) and in 
vitro potency proved key for development of this series. Compound 7 was stable in 
microsomes and hepatocytes, predictive of good metabolic stability (Extended Data Table 
3). The compound was orally bioavailable and showed a linearity of pharmacokinetics from 
10 to 300 mg/kg in rats (Extended Data Table 4). In our mouse model of infection the 
compound demonstrated comparable activity to the front-line drug miltefosine, reducing 
parasite levels by 99% when dosed orally twice a day for 10 days at 25 mg/kg (Fig. 2). 
Efficacy of treatment was dependent on dose, frequency (twice a day better than once), and 
duration (10 days better than 5). The non-clinical safety data for s regulatory preclinical

 studies. In vitro assays demonstrated that this compound did not significantly inhibit 
cytochrome P450 enzymes, mitigating a potential risk of problematic drug-drug interactions 
that is particularly relevant due to the frequency of VL/HIV co-infections1.
As the series was developed from a known protein kinase scaffold13, Cellzome’s 
Kinobead™ technology was used to determine if compound 7 inhibits human protein 
kinases14. These experiments indicated that compound 7 interacted with four human 
kinases, MAPK11, NLK, MAPK14 and CDK7, at concentrations within multiples of the 
predicted clinical dose (Table S1). However, the extent of inhibition of these human kinases 
is not sufficient to preclude clinical development of the molecule and no significant 
inhibition of other human kinases was detected in the Kinobead™ assays. Non-GLP 
preclinical assessment of cardiovascular effects and genotoxicity did not reveal any issues 
that would prevent further development. Additionally, there were no significant adverse 
effects in a rat 7-day repeat dose oral toxicity study with respect to clinical chemistry and 
histopathology at all doses tested. Both the in vivo efficacy and safety profile of compound 7 
support progression to definitive safety studies.
Mode of Action Studies
Elucidating the mode of action of novel chemical series can greatly benefit drug discovery 
campaigns15. Since there is no blueprint to establish the mode of action of bioactive small 
molecules16,17, several complementary methodologies were employed. Representative 
pyrazolopyrimidine analogues (4, 5, 6 and 7) from the drug discovery program were used as 
chemical tools (Fig. 1), including compound 8, where the diaminocyclohexyl group was 
replaced by an aminopiperidine amide. These compounds showed very good activity 
correlation between the intra-macrophage, axenic amastigote and promastigote assays, 
giving us confidence to use the extracellular parasite forms (promastigote) for mode of 
action studies where it was not possible to use the intracellular forms (amastigote) (Table 
S2).
As a first step towards identifying the target(s) of the leishmanocidal pyrazolopyrimidine 
series, structure activity relationships were used to inform the design of analogues 
containing a polyethyleneglycol (PEG) linker (9, 11, 12; Extended Data Fig. 2), which were 
then covalently attached to magnetic beads to allow for chemical proteomics. Firstly, beads 
derivatized with 9 were used to pull down proteins from SILAC (Stable Isotope Labelling by 
Amino Acids in Cell Culture)-labelled L. donovani promastigote lysates18 in the presence 
(“light-labelled lysate”) or absence (“heavy-labelled lysate”) of 10 µM compound 10, a 
structurally related, bioactive derivative of compound 9 19. After combining the bead eluates 
and performing proteomic analyses, proteins that bound specifically to the 
pyrazolopyrimidine pharmacophore could be distinguished from proteins that bound non-
specifically to the beads by virtue of high heavy : light tryptic peptide isotope ratios. These 
experiments identified CRK12, CRK6, CYC9, CRK3, MPK9, CYC6 and a putative STE11-
like protein kinase (LinJ.24.1500) as specific binders to the compound 9-derivatised beads 
(Log2 heavy : light ratio >2.8; 7-fold enrichment) (Fig. S5; Table S3). Secondly, pull down 
experiments were conducted with beads derivatized with 9, 11 or 12, followed by 
competition studies with 5, 8 and 8, respectively. Adherent proteins were washed off the

 beads, digested with trypsin and labelled with isobaric tandem mass tags. Comparison of the 
labelled peptides derived from experiments, with and without competition, by liquid 
chromatography / mass spectrometry identified proteins likely to specifically bind to the 
immobilized ligands. Potential candidates identified included: CRK3, CRK6, CRK12, 
CYC3, CYC6, CYC9, MPK9, MPK5 and several hypothetical proteins (Fig. S6; Table S4). 
We also investigated immobilizing the compound at an alternate position on the scaffold and 
this gave a similar binding profile (Fig. S6; Table S4), further validating the approach. These 
results are consistent with previous studies which report that the pyrazolopyrimidine core 
binds to protein kinases13,20–22.
The presence of cdc2-related kinases (CRK3, 6 and 12) and cyclins (CYC3, 6 and 9) in the 
initial target list led us to analyze the effects of pyrazolopyrimidines (5, 6, 7 and 8) on cell-
cycle progression in L. donovani. Treatment resulted in an accumulation of cells in G1 and 
in G2/M and a decrease in the proportion of cells in S phase (Fig. 3a for compound 7 and 
Fig. S9 for 5, 6 and 8), suggesting arrests in the cell-cycle at G1/S and G2/M, consistent 
with a mode of action via CRK and/or CYC components.
Resistance was generated in L. donovani promastigotes against compounds 4 and 5. A single 
cloned parental cell line was divided into three individual cultures for each compound and 
resistance was generated by exposing parasites to step-wise increasing concentrations of 
compound. Following resistance generation, each independently generated cell line was 
cloned and 3 individual clones from each compound selection (6 in total) were selected for 
in depth study. The resulting clones demonstrated >500-fold and 9→17-fold resistance to 
compounds 4 and 5, respectively (Extended Data Table 5). Resistance to both compounds 
was found to be stable over 50 days in culture in the absence of drug pressure and, 
significantly, all clones showed cross-resistance to 4 and 5, and 20→50-fold cross-resistance 
to 7. These data suggest our pyrazolopyrimidines share common mechanisms of resistance 
and most likely modes of action. Importantly, intracellular amastigotes, derived from the 
resistant promastigotes, were 8.5-fold and 5-fold resistant to 5 and 7, respectively, compared 
to wild-type parasites (Extended Data Table 6) strongly suggesting that their mechanism(s) 
of action are the same in promastigote and intracellular amastigote stages of the parasite.
To gain further insight into the mechanism of action and potential target(s) of this 
pyrazolopyrimidine series, our 6 drug-resistant clones underwent whole genome sequence 
analysis. A range of mutations, relative to parental clones, were found across the genome 
(Table S5), including a long region with loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 9. In total, 
75 sites were identified genome-wide that each had single base substitutions resulting in a 
non-synonymous change in at least one clone (Table S6). The majority (65) of non-
synonymous substitutions consisted of derived clones losing a parental allele but amplifying 
the remaining allele. In five of the six resistant clones a new heterozygous substitution was 
selected in a single gene of unknown function (LdBPK_251630) but most strikingly, in all 6 
drug-resistant clones, a single homozygous non-synonymous substitution was found in 
CRK12 (LdBPK_090270), a gene within the long loss-of-heterozygosity region. This 
mutation changes Gly572 to Asp and falls within the region predicted to encode the catalytic 
domain of L. donovani CRK12. This suggests that CRK12 is the target of the 
pyrazolopyrimdines. Extensive variations in chromosomal copy numbers are common in 
Wyllie et al.

 Leishmania23,24, and extra copies of chromosome 9, containing the CRK12 gene, were 
found in four out of six drug-resistant clones (Table S7). Additionally, three of these four 
clones had extra copies of chromosome 32, containing the gene for CYC9. Previous studies 
in T. brucei have established that the partner cyclin of CRK12 is CYC925. This suggests that 
CYC9 may be the cognate cyclin partner for L. donovani CRK12.
Target validation
To dissect the role of CRK12 and CYC9 in the mechanism of action and resistance of 
pyrazolopyrimidines a series of protein overexpression studies were undertaken in L. 
donovani promastigotes. In all cases, overexpression of putative targets was confirmed by 
elevated levels of transcripts in our transgenic cell lines relative to WT, as determined by 
qRT-PCR (Table S8).
Counter-intuitively, overexpression of wild-type CRK12 (CRK12WT) rendered the parasites 
~3-fold more sensitive to 5 (Fig. 3b). The overexpression of CYC9 alone had no effect on 
compound resistance, but co-overexpression of CYC9 and CRK12WT rendered the 
transgenic parasites ~3-fold resistant to compounds 5 and 7 (Fig. 3c and Table S8). Next, we 
looked at the mutated (Gly572 to Asp) version of CRK12 (CRK12MUT) identified in all of 
our drug-resistant clones. Overexpression of CRK12MUT rendered the parasites ~3.4-fold 
resistant to 5 (Fig. 3d and Table S8) and to the preclinical lead compound 7 (Table S8), 
while being equally sensitive to the unrelated nitroimidazole drug fexinidazole sulfone 
(Table S9). Co-overexpression of CRK12MUT and CYC9 rendered the parasites ~6-fold 
resistant to compound 7 and ~8-fold resistant to compound 5. This shift in sensitivity is 
considerably greater than the 3.4-fold resistance observed with parasites overexpressing 
CRK12MUT alone (Fig. 3d). Replacing a single copy of the CRK12 gene with a drug 
selectable marker left parasites ~2-fold more susceptible to compound 5 than WT (Fig. 3e, 
Fig. S10). We were unable to directly replace both endogenous copies of the CRK12 gene, 
except in the presence of an ectopic copy of the gene, suggesting that the CRK12 gene is 
essential for the growth and survival of L. donovani (Fig. S10).
Initially, CRK3 and CRK6 were identified as credible targets based upon our collective 
proteomics datasets, as well as their established roles in kinetoplastid cell cycle 
regulation26,27. However, whole genome sequencing, qPCR (Fig. S8) and Southern blot 
(Fig. S7) analysis of resistant clones confirmed that mutations within, or amplification of, 
the CRK3 and CRK6 genes were not responsible for resistance to pyrazolopyrimidines. 
Direct modulation of CRK3 and CRK6 levels within L. donovani promastigotes, by 
generating overexpressing and single gene knockout parasites, did not alter drug sensitivity 
(Table S8). Overexpression of CRK3 and CRK6 in combination with their cognate cyclin 
partners CYC6 and CYC3 was not possible since co-overexpression proved toxic. 
Collectively, these data suggest that the primary mechanism of action of this compound 
series is unlikely to be via CRK3 or CRK6 inhibition.
Commonly, overexpression of a compound’s molecular target is accompanied by an increase 
in drug resistance. With this in mind, our collective data strongly suggest that the principal 
target of our pyrazolopyrimidine series is the CYC9-activated form of CRK12, such that 
overexpression of CRK12 and CYC9 together provides resistance. This hypothesis is also 
Wyllie et al.

 consistent with the amplification of both CRK12 and CYC9 in resistant parasites; as well as 
the identification of both proteins in our SILAC and Kinobead™ proteomic datasets. That 
overexpression of CYC9 alone has no effect suggests that CYC9 is, to some extent, in 
excess over CRK12 and thus overexpression of CRK12MUT can provide (~3-fold) resistance 
that is increased when additional CYC9 is co-expressed (~8-fold). The “hyper-sensitivity” of 
parasites overexpressing CRK12WT alone to these compounds remains perplexing. One 
potential explanation is that CRK12WT bound to a pyrazolopyrimidine in the absence of a 
CYC9 subunit is particularly toxic to the parasite. Alternatively, elevated levels of CRK12 
may well sequester other cyclins thereby preventing their essential interactions with other 
CRKs. Further studies will be required to test these hypotheses.
Given that the compounds from this chemical series interacted with protein kinases, in 
particular CRK12, we used Cellzome’s Kinobead™ technology14,28,29 with axenic 
amastigote extracts to identify pyrazolopyrimidine-binders in the Leishmania kinome. These 
experiments were performed in the presence or absence of an excess of the soluble parent 
compound 5. All proteins captured by the beads were quantified by TMT tagging of tryptic 
peptides followed by LC-MS/MS analysis30. CRK12, MPK9, CRK6 and CYC3 (Fig. 4a) 
were identified, consistent with the other experiments above. A dose response experiment 
was performed in which 5 was added over a range of concentrations in order to establish a 
competition-binding curve and determine a half-maximal inhibition (IC50) value (Fig. 4b). 
The IC50 values obtained in these experiments represent a measure of target affinity, but are 
also affected by the affinity of the target for the bead-immobilized ligands. The latter effect 
can be deduced by determining the depletion of the target proteins by the beads, such that 
apparent dissociation constants (Kdapp) can be determined that are largely independent from 
the bead ligand30. The apparent dissociation constants (Kdapp) were determined as 1.4 nM 
for CRK12, 45 nM for MPK9, 58 nM for CYC3 and 97 nM for CRK6. These values are 
determined in physiological conditions (substrates, cyclins and ATP) and provide further 
compelling evidence that the principal target of this compound series is CRK12. Further 
pull-downs with a resin-bound pyrazolopyrimidine analogue (11) were conducted in parallel 
with the Kinobead™ experiments and returned broadly similar results (Fig. 4 c, d).
Collectively, our data provides strong evidence that CRK12 forms a significant interaction 
with CYC9: (a) our studies indicate that overexpression of CYC9 alongside CRK12 
markedly increases resistance to our pyrazolopyrimidine compounds; (b) in several of our 
compound-resistant cell lines, additional copies of chromosome 32, containing the CYC9 
gene were found; (c) in the related organism T. brucei CYC9 was confirmed as the partner 
cyclin for CRK12; (d) in several chemical proteomics studies CYC9 was identified as 
binding to immobilized compounds from our pyrazolopyrimidines alongside CRK12.
Modelling
A homology model was built for L. donovani CRK12 using the structure of human cyclin 
dependent kinase 9 (CDK9, PDB code:4BCF) as a template. (Interestingly 7 showed an IC50 
> 20 μM against CDK9 in the Kinobeads™ assay.) A combination of docking studies, 
molecular dynamics simulation and free energy calculations indicated the most likely 
binding mode is that shown in Fig. 5 (see supporting information for discussion). With very

 few exceptions, the binding modes of protein kinase inhibitors are highly conserved across 
kinase family members; searching the protein database revealed a related 5-amino-
pyrazolopyrimidine, which bound to ALK in a very similar fashion (PDB code 4Z55, ligand 
4LO). In our proposed binding mode, the bicyclic scaffold interacts with the hinge residues 
establishing two hydrogen bonds between the sp2 pyrimidine nitrogen in position 6 and the 
backbone NH of Ala566 and between the pyrazole NH in position 1 and the backbone 
carbonyl oxygen of Ala564 (Fig. 5b). A third hydrogen bond is also established between the 
amino NH in position 5 and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Ala566. The substituent in 
position 3 of the pyrazole ring is directed towards the ATP back pocket interfacing with the 
gatekeeper residue (Phe563). This binding mode is consistent with the analogues 9, 11 and 
12 retaining binding affinity, with the PEG linkers being attached to water-accessible parts 
of the core. The Gly572Asp mutation causing resistance to the pyrazolopyrimidine series is 
located at the end of the hinge region nine residues from the gatekeeper. In the Gly572Asp 
mutant, the negatively charged side chain of the aspartic acid is positioned in close contact to 
the oxygen atoms of the sulfonamide moiety leading to an unfavorable electrostatic 
interaction.
Discussion
New oral drugs for VL, particularly those capable of treating on-going outbreaks in East 
Africa, are urgently needed. Effective drugs will make a significant difference to treatment 
outcomes for this devastating parasitic disease. With the ultimate goal of VL elimination, 
multiple new treatment options will be required. We have identified a pyrazolopyrimidine 
series showing potential to treat VL. Our studies indicate that the principal mechanism of 
action of our pyrazolopyrimidine compounds is through inhibition of CRK12, defining 
CRK12 as one of very few chemically-validated drug targets in Leishmania. Further, our 
data indicate that CYC9 is the definitive partner cyclin for CRK12. The physiological 
function(s) of CRK12/CYC9 have yet to be determined and the availability of our inhibitory 
pyrazolopyrimidines should assist in probing this aspect of parasite biology.
It is clear from our collective chemical proteomics studies that the pyrazolopyrimidines also 
interact with other Leishmania protein kinases, in particular CRK6 and CRK3, albeit with 
significantly lower affinities than for CRK12. While CRK12 is undoubtedly the principal 
target of this compound series, we cannot rule out the possibility that underlying this 
mechanism of action is an element of polypharmacology. Indeed, inhibition of secondary 
kinase targets may be responsible for some of the phenotypic effects observed in drug-
treated parasites, such as cell cycle arrest.
Compound 7 is being advanced towards human clinical trials and is currently undergoing 
preclinical development. The data generated to date provides a reason to believe that 
compound 7 has the potential to fulfil the community target product profile31. However, as a 
systematic approach to drug discovery is relatively new in this neglected disease and there is 
a lack of correlation between pre-clinical and clinical data, there are outstanding questions 
that can only be answered as the compound progresses through development.
