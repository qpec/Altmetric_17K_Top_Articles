T
he rate of opioid prescription for pain treatment has 
been increasing rapidly in North America in the past 
20 years.1,2 For example, between 2001 and 2010, the per-
centage of patients receiving an opioid prescription during an 
emergency department visit increased from 20.8% to 31%, a rela-
tive increase of 49%.1 Furthermore, the frequency of opioid pre-
scription increases with age.3
Opioids are sometimes necessary to treat acute pain, but they 
can cause adverse effects, especially in the older population.4–6 It 
has been found that drugs that affect the central nervous system 
(e.g., drugs that cause sedation and dizziness) can increase the 
risk of falling.7 Falls are frequent among people aged 65 years and 
older (28%–35% fall each year)8 and constitute a leading cause of 
injuries, hospital admissions and deaths among older people.9
Several studies have established an association between opi-
oid use and risk of falls or fractures in the older population.10–17 In 
a nested case–control study, Moden and colleagues found that 
using psychotropic drugs increased the risk of falls in older peo-
ple. Specifically, opioid use was more likely to induce a fall within 
the next week (odds ratio [OR] = 6.07 for men and 5.16 for 
women).13 In another study in a level-1 trauma centre with 
patients of all ages, falls were more prevalent among patients 
who had used opioids in the month preceding the trauma com-
pared with patients who had not (32.8% v. 22.0%).10 Further-
more, Söderberg and colleagues found that taking opioids 
increases the likelihood of an imminent fall-related injury.12 For 
example, having a prescription of opioids filled 1 week before the 
fall is associated with an OR of 5.14 of falling compared with an 
OR of 1.23 when the prescription is filled within 4 weeks of the 
fall. However, other studies did not find a significant association 
between opioid use and falls,18–20 and none examined this in 
severely injured older people who are at higher risk of death.
The objectives of the study were to examine the association 
between recent opioid use and the risk, as well as the clinical 
outcomes, of fall-related injury in a large trauma population of 
older adults. We hypothesized that fall-related injuries will be 
more likely to occur with recent opioid use than injuries that 
occur from other mechanisms.

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Evidence for an associa-
tion between opioid use and risk of falls or 
fractures in older adults is inconsistent. We 
examine the association between recent 
opioid use and the risk, as well as the clin-
ical outcomes, of fall-related injuries in a 
large trauma population of older adults.
METHODS: In a retrospective, observa-
tional, multicentre cohort study con-
ducted on registry data, we included all 
patients aged 65 years and older who 
were admitted (hospital stay > 2 d) for 
injury in 57 trauma centres in the prov-
ince of Quebec, Canada, between 2004 
and 2014. We looked at opioid prescrip-
tions filled in the 2 weeks preceding the 
trauma in patients who sustained a fall, 
compared with those who sustained an 
injury through another mechanism.
RESULTS: A total of 67 929 patients were 
retained for analysis. Mean age was 
80.9 (± 8.0) years and 69% were women. 
The percentage of patients who had filled 
an opioid prescription in the 2 weeks pre-
ceding an injury was 4.9% (95% confi-
dence interval [CI] 4.7%–5.1%) for 
patients who had had a fall, compared 
with 1.5% (95% CI 1.2%–1.8%) for those 
who had had an injury through another 
mechanism. After we controlled for con-
founding variables, patients who had 
filled an opioid prescription within 
2 weeks before injury were 2.4 times 
more likely to have a fall rather than any 
other type of injury. For patients who had 
a fall-related injury, those who used opi-
oids were at increased risk of in-hospital 
death (odds ratio 1.58; 95% CI 1.34–1.86).
INTERPRETATION: Recent opioid use is 
associated with an increased risk of fall 
and an increased likelihood of death in 
older adults.

Methods
Study design and population
We conducted a retrospective, multicentre cohort study using 
medical consultations and medications from 2 governmental 
population databases (Quebec Trauma Registry and Régie de 
l’assurance maladie du Québec [RAMQ]). We included patients 
aged 65 years and older who were admitted for injury in any of 
the 57 adult trauma centres (3 level I, 5 level II, 21 level III and 28 
level IV) in the province of Quebec, Canada, between Jan. 1, 
2004, and Mar. 31, 2014. We excluded patients who were not 
covered by the RAMQ medication insurance for the year preced-
ing the trauma and patients with no recorded mechanism of 
their injury.
Data sources
The Quebec Trauma Registry was developed in 1993 and involves 
the mandatory collection of prospective data for patients admit-
ted to any trauma centre according to the following criteria: 
deaths following injury, hospital stay greater than 2 days, inten-
sive care unit or transfer from another hospital. Medical archivists 
extract registry data from patients’ medical files using standard-
ized coding protocols. Anatomic injuries are coded with the 
Abbreviated Injury Scale according to recommendations pub-
lished by the Association for the Advancement of Automotive 
Medicine.21 The registry is centralized at the RAMQ of the Quebec 
Ministry of Health and is subject to periodic validation.
The RAMQ medical consultations and medication database is 
an administrative database maintained by the Quebec Ministry of 
Health and contains diagnostic information of all medical consul-
tations and medication prescriptions filled for every patient cov-
ered by the RAMQ medication insurance in the province of Quebec, 
which represents 78% of our sample. The medication database 
contains the date of dispensation, common drug denominations, 
form, dosage and quantity prescribed by physicians.
We linked the 2 databases using unique anonymous identi-
fication numbers provided by the RAMQ. Patient information 
was available for the time period ranging from 1 year before 
the trauma to 8 years after hospital discharge (maximum 
allowed).
Outcomes
We searched for filled opioid prescriptions, including codeine, 
hydromorphone, meperidine, oxycodone, methadone, fentanyl, 
tramadol, tramacet, pentazocine and morphine. Hydrocodone is 
not used for pain management in Canada. Recent opioid use was 
defined as filling at least 1 opioid prescription during the 14 days 
preceding the target trauma.17 Some authors chose a 28- to 30-day 
period10,12 before trauma, but Söderberg and colleagues found a 
greater association between opioid use and falls with a 2-week 
period. In a sensitivity analysis, we divided the recent opioid users 
into 2 groups: those who used opioids in the 2-week period preced-
ing the trauma but had not filled a prescription for opioids in the 
previous 3 months (naive opioid user), and those who had used 
opioids in the 2-week period preceding the trauma and in the previ-
ous 3 months (non-naive opioid user).
Variables
From the 2 databases, we extracted the following data: age, sex, injury 
mechanisms (fall, motor vehicle crash, penetrating injury or blunt 
object injury), Injury Severity Score (ISS), Abbreviated Injury Scale, 
number of injuries, duration of stay in emergency department, dura-
tion of stay in hospital, surgery during hospital stay and admission to 
intensive care unit (ICU), as well as history of alcoholism, depression 
or anxiety 1 year before the target injury. We used an ISS score greater 
than 15 to define major trauma or polytrauma.22 We used the first digit 
of the Abbreviated Injury Scale score to identify the injury regions for 
each wound, and the RAMQ medical consultation database to identify 
patients who had an International Classification of Disease (ICD)-9 or 
ICD-10 code for depression, anxiety, alcoholism, falls leading to hospi-
tal admission, diagnosis of malignant tumour or other comorbidities 
(asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure, Parkinson disease, chronic 
airway obstruction, renal failure, heart failure, coronary artery athero-
sclerosis and dementia) during the year preceding the injury. Finally, 
we searched in the RAMQ medication database for at least 1 filled pre-
scription of medication known to affect balance according to the 
Beers Criteria for Potentially Inappropriate Medication Use in Older 
Adults23 (antidepressant, antipsychotic, benzodiazepine, anticholiner-
gic, antithrombotic and cardiovascular drugs) during the 14 days pre-
ceding the target trauma.
Statistical analysis
We compared the characteristics of the included sample and 
those of patients who were excluded using Cohen’s effect sizes. 
We evaluated associations between mechanism of injury (fall v. 
other) and recent opioid use and clinical characteristics using 
univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses.
In patients who had sustained injuries after a fall, we evalu-
ated associations between opioid prescriptions filled 2 weeks 
before the fall and trauma outcomes using univariate and multi-
variate logistic regression analyses. Finally, we used a multivari-
ate logistic regression to estimate the association between in-
hospital mortality and opioid consumption within 2 weeks 
before the fall while controlling for confounding factors. Finally, 
as a sensitivity analysis, we evaluated the association between 
opioid use (naive or non-naive opioid users) and injury mechan-
ism or in-hospital mortality using multivariate logistic regression 
analyses. Alpha levels were set at 0.05 and all analyses were per-
formed using SPSS version 23 (IBM, Somers, NY).
Ethics approval
Access to the administrative database and medication database 
maintained by the Quebec Ministry of Health required the approval of 
the ethics review boards of the Commission d’accès à l’information du 
Québec and of the Responsable de l’accès à l’information et de la pro-
tection des renseignements personnels de la RAMQ.
Results
The Quebec Trauma Registry included a total of 84 241 adult 
patients aged 65 and older who were admitted for a trauma 
between 2004 and 2014. Of these patients, we excluded 16.5% 
because they were not covered by the RAMQ medication insurance

and another 2.8% because they did not have a valid code for 
injury mechanism, leaving 67 929 patients for the final sample 
(Appendix 1, Supplemental Figure S1, available at www.cmaj.ca/
lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.171286/-/DC1). Excluded 
patients were similar in all aspects to the selected sample 
(Appendix 2, Supplemental Table S2, available at www.cmaj.ca/
lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj.171286/-/DC1).
For the whole sample, the mean age was 81.0 (± 8.0) years 
and 69% were female. The most common mechanism of injury 
was falls (92%), 59% had surgery and the median hospital stay 
duration was 12 days. The percentage of patients who had filled 
an opioid prescription within 2 weeks preceding any type of 
injury was 4.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.4%–5.0%). This 
percentage was 4.9% (95% CI 4.7%–5.1%) for patients who had a 
fall-related injury, and 1.5% (95% CI 1.2%–1.8%) for patients who 
had an injury via another mechanism. Opioid prescriptions filled 
before injuries were most frequently hydromorphone (35%), oxy-
codone (24%), morphine (20%) and fentanyl (14%).
Table 1 shows the unadjusted and adjusted ORs for patients 
who had a fall compared with patients who had an injury via 
another mechanism. Controlling for confounding variables, 
being older (≥ 85 yr: OR = 5.6; 95% CI 5.1–6.2), being a female 
(OR = 2.4; 95% CI 2.3–2.5), having filled a prescription of medica-
tions known to affect balance (OR = 1.8; 95% CI 1.7–1.9), having 
falls leading to hospital admissions, having a history of alcohol-
ism during the year before target injury, having a history of frac-
tures, receiving a diagnosis of malignant tumour in the year 
before the injury, having more comorbidities in the year before 
the injury, and filling an opioid prescription (within 2 weeks 
before the injury) were all significantly associated with falls.

Notably, patients who had filled an opioid prescription within 
2 weeks before injury were 2.4 times (95% CI 1.9–3.0) more likely to 
have suffered a fall rather than an injury via another mechanism. 
For patients who had suffered a fall-related injury, those who had 
filled an opioid prescription within 2 weeks before the injury had sig-
nificantly more thorax and spine regions affected, were more likely to 
be women and had longer hospital stays (Table 2). There was also an 
increase in mortality during hospital stay in these patients compared 
with those who did not use opioids. However, recent opioid use was 
associated with a decreased number of ICU admissions, a decreased 
need for surgery, a decreased number of incidents of major trauma 
(ISS > 15), a decreased number of patients with 3 injuries or more and

before the fall were also significantly associated with in-hospital 
mortality (Table 3).
In a sensitivity analysis, naive (adjusted OR = 2.25; 95% CI 
1.61–3.15) and non-naive (adjusted OR = 4.17; 95% CI 3.14–5.54) 
opioid users had an increased risk of falls compared with another 
mechanism of injury. There was also an increase in mortality dur-
ing hospital stay in naive (adjusted OR = 1.70; 95% CI 1.28–2.27) 
and non-naive (adjusted OR = 1.54; 95% CI 1.27–1.87) opioid 
users compared with those who did not use opioids.
Interpretation
This study confirms an association between recent opioid use 
and fall-related injury in a large trauma population of older 
adults (67 929 patients). Furthermore, it shows that pre-injury 
opioid use is also associated with increased hospital mortality 
for older patients with a fall-related injury. Patients included in 
the registry had a median hospital stay of 14 days and had to 
undergo surgery in more than 50% of cases, suggesting that 
these injuries had serious consequences. Results were similar for 
opioid-naive or non–opioid-naive older trauma patients.
Concordant with our results, opioid use has been previously 
associated with increased risk of fall-related injury.10–14,16,17 Our OR 
of 2.4 (when adjusted for confounders) is comparable with that 
observed in other studies based on older populations: hazard ratio 
(HR) of 2.05 in hip fractures,17 OR of 3.3 for fall or fracture,11 HR of 
2.27 for injury with codeine combination,16 and HR of 4.9 for any 
fractures.14 Adverse effects, like the sedation and dizziness fre-
quently observed with opioids,24 can compromise coordination 
and be responsible for fall-related injuries, especially in the older 
population with increased visual impairment and loss of balance.13 
In addition to previous opioid use, being a female, being older, 
having a history of alcoholism and using antidepressants or anti-
psychotics drugs were significantly associated with fall-related 
injuries, which is in accordance with previous studies.13,15,25–27
We found that more women than men had filled an opioid 
prescription before the fall-related injury. Another study found 
the same result but for all types of injury mechanisms. This sug-
gests that women could be more susceptible to the adverse 
effects of opioids.10 There was also a significant but weak associ-
ation between opioid use before the trauma and back or thoracic 
injury. This could suggest that older patients who are taking opi-
oids are less inclined to slow down their fall with their arms.
Patients with fall-related injury and recently filled opioid pre-
scriptions had less major trauma, fewer surgeries and fewer con-
current injuries than patients who did not use opioids before the 
fall, suggesting that their injuries were potentially less severe. How-
ever, their median hospital stay was longer and they died more 
often during the hospital stay, suggesting that a fall associated with 
opioid use may be a marker of frailty. The only other study that 
examines mortality with opioid use in trauma patients found no 
significant relation between the two.10 However, the mean age of 
that sample was younger (42 yr) and included all types of injury 
mechanisms. It is possible that older patients could be more vul-
nerable to opioid use than younger patients and, as stated before, 
it is likely that a fall associated with opioid use is a marker of frailty. 
Because these results were not the primary outcome of the present 
study, they should be confirmed by future studies.
Limitations
This study has some limitations. The retrospective design of the 
study can demonstrate only an association between opioid use and 
falls; no causal relationship between the two phenomena can be 
inferred. We can hypothesize that because patients generally use 
opioids to treat pain, it may be the pain itself (and not the opioid) 
that causes the fall. Furthermore, our definition of opioid use is fill-
ing an opioid prescription in the previous 2 weeks, and it is possible 
that the drug was not consumed by the patient. However, this is 
also true for patients with other mechanisms of injury. Medications 
administered during the target hospital stay were not available and 
therefore could not be controlled in the mortality analysis. In addi-
tion, our fall-related injury group was compared with a group of 
older patients who had other mechanisms of injury (motor vehicle 
crash or penetrating trauma). These latter patients could have 
some characteristics that differed from a group of older patients 
who did not have injury. However, opioids can also affect the atten-
tion and reaction time of drivers, so opioid use could also have 
been a factor for patients who had motor crashes.28 Consequently, 
our association between opioid use and falls could have been 
higher. Furthermore, we studied only falls that were related to sub-
stantial injuries and led to a hospital stay, so the frequency of fall 
associated with opioids could be higher. Examining only falls 
related to substantial injuries could also explain the association 
that we found between opioids and increased in-hospital mortality. 
Finally, as stated earlier, falls associated with opioid use could be a 
marker of frailty and not necessarily point to a causal association.
Physicians should be aware that prescribing opioids to 
older adults is not only associated with an increased risk of 
falls but also, if these patients do fall, a higher in-hospital mor-
tality rate.
Conclusion
These results show that recent opioid use is associated with an 
increased risk of falls in older adults and an increased likelihood 
of death in those with fall-related injuries.
