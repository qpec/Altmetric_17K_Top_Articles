AbstRAct
Regular physical activity (PA) is increasingly 
promoted for people with rheumatic and 
musculoskeletal diseases as well as the general 
population. We evaluated if the public health 
recommendations for PA are applicable for people 
with inflammatory arthritis (iA; Rheumatoid 
Arthritis and Spondyloarthritis) and osteoarthritis 
(hip/knee OA) in order to develop evidence-based 
recommendations for advice and guidance on 
PA in clinical practice. The EULAR standardised 
operating procedures for the development of 
recommendations were followed. A task force (TF) 
(including rheumatologists, other medical specialists 
and physicians, health professionals, patient-
representatives, methodologists) from 16 countries 
met twice. In the first TF meeting, 13 research 
questions to support a systematic literature review 
(SLR) were identified and defined. In the second 
meeting, the SLR evidence was presented and 
discussed before the recommendations, research 
agenda and education agenda were formulated. 
The TF developed and agreed on four overarching 
principles and 10 recommendations for PA in people 
with iA and OA. The mean level of agreement 
between the TF members ranged between 9.8 
and 8.8. Given the evidence for its effectiveness, 
feasibility and safety, PA is advocated as integral 
part of standard care throughout the course of these 
diseases. Finally, the TF agreed on related research 
and education agendas. Evidence and expert opinion 
inform these recommendations to provide guidance 
in the development, conduct and evaluation of PA-
interventions and promotion in people with iA and 
OA. It is advised that these recommendations should 
be implemented considering individual needs and 
national health systems.
IntRoductIon 
Physical activity (PA) is defined as ‘any bodily 
movement produced by skeletal muscles that 
results in energy expenditure above resting 
(basal) levels. PA broadly encompasses exercise, 
sports and physical activities done as part of 
daily living, occupation, leisure and active trans-
portation’.1 2 Exercise is a subcategory of PA 
‘that is planned, structured and repetitive and 
[that] has, as a final or intermediate objective, 
the improvement or maintenance of one or more 
dimensions of physical fitness’.1 2 PA-interven-
tions can be provided or performed individually 
or in groups, supervised or non-supervised, in 
acute or chronic health states, but should always 
include behavioural change techniques (BCT) to 
promote long-term adherence.3 4 
To promote the health benefits of PA in the 
general population, the WHO5 and American 
College of Sports Medicine (ACSM)2 have provided 
internationally accepted recommendations for 
PA (table 1). In this manuscript, the term PA 
always includes both physical activity and exercise 
according to the definitions above.
Inflammatory arthritis (iA, in this manuscript 
encompassing rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spon-
dyloarthritis (SpA)) and osteoarthritis (OA) (in this 
manuscript encompassing hip/knee OA (HOA/
KOA)) are major causes of pain and disability world-
wide.6 There is strong evidence for the benefits of 
PA on improvements on disease activity,7 activities 
and participation; however, people with rheumatic 
and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) are in general 
less active compared with healthy controls.8–10 
Possible underlying reasons could be that healthcare 
providers (HCP
, including rheumatology health 
professionals (eg, physiotherapist (PT), occupa-
tional therapist (OT), nurse, podiatrist, psycholo-
gist), physical education professions and medical 
doctors (rheumatologists and other specialists)) and 
people with iA and OA may be reluctant towards 
engaging in PA, fearing flare-up or joint damage by 
exercising.11 Furthermore, current clinical manage-
ment recommendations such as the European 
League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommen-
dations on the management of RA,12 SpA13 or HOA/
KOA14 and the ACSM guidelines for exercise testing 
and prescription15 recommend exercise and/or PA, 
but none of these is specific regarding the required 
type and dosage. Therefore, it is not clear how these 
recommendations should be used in routine clinical 
care. In particular, the evidence on the effectiveness 
and safety of exercise and PA to a level that meets 
public health (PH) recommendations has not yet 
been clearly examined and defined in people with 
RMDs. A EULAR task force (TF) was therefore set 
up (1) to evaluate if the PH recommendations for 
PA are applicable for people with iA and OA; (2) to

Recommendation
table 1 Public Health recommendations for PA
the AcsM-AHA primary physical activity recommendations*
 
► All healthy adults aged 18–65 years should participate in moderate intensity aerobic PA for a minimum of 30 min on 5 days/week or vigorous intensity aerobic activity for a 
minimum of 20 min on 3 days/week.
 
► Combinations of moderate and vigorous intensity exercise can be performed to meet this recommendation.
 
► Moderate intensity aerobic activity can be accumulated to total the 30 min minimum by performing bouts each lasting ≥10 min.
 
► Every adult should perform activities that maintain or increase muscular strength and endurance for a minimum of 2 days/week.
 
► Because of the dose-response relationship between PA and health, individuals who wish further improve their fitness, reduce their risk of chronic diseases and disabilities and/
or prevent unhealthy weight gain my benefit by exceeding the minimum recommended amounts of PA.
Cardiorespiratory (‘aerobic’) exercise†
  
Frequency
≥5 days/week of moderate exercise or ≥3 days/week of vigorous exercise or a combination of moderate and vigorous exercise on ≥3–5 days/week is 
recommended.
  
Intensity
Moderate and/or vigorous intensity is recommended for most adults. Light to moderate intensity exercise may be beneficial in deconditioned persons.
  
Time
30–60 min/day (150 min/week) of purposeful moderate exercise or 20–60 min/day (75 min/week) of vigorous exercise or a combination of moderate 
and vigorous exercise per day is recommended for most adults. ≥20 min/day (150 min/week) of exercise can be beneficial, especially in previously 
sedentary persons.
  
Type
Regular, purposeful exercise that involves major muscle groups and is continuous and rhythmic in nature is recommended.
  
Volume
A target volume of ≥500–1000 MET min/week is recommended. Increasing pedometer step counts by ≥2000 steps per day to reach a daily step 
count ≥7000 steps per day is beneficial. Exercising below these volumes may still be beneficial for persons unable or unwilling to reach this amount 
of exercise.
  
Pattern
Exercise may be performed in one (continuous) session per day or in multiple sessions of ≥10 min to accumulate the desired duration and volume of 
exercise per day. Exercise bouts of ≥10 min may yield favourable adaptations in very deconditioned individuals. Interval training can be effective in 
adults.
  
Progression
A gradual progression of exercise volume by adjusting exercise duration, frequency and/or intensity is reasonable until the desired exercise goal 
(maintenance) is attained. This approach may enhance adherence and reduce risks of musculoskeletal injury and adverse CHD events.
Resistance exercise† 
  
Frequency
Each major muscle group should be trained on 2–3 days/week
  
Intensity
60%–70% of the 1RM (moderate to hard intensity) for novice to intermediate exercisers to improve strength.
≥80% of the 1RM (hard to very hard intensity) for experienced strength trainers to improve strength.
40%–50% of the 1RM (very light to light intensity) for older persons beginning exercise to improve strength.
40%–50% of the 1RM (very light to light intensity) may be beneficial for improving strength in sedentary persons beginning a resistance training 
programme.
≤50% of the 1RM (light to moderate intensity) to improve muscular endurance.
20%–50% of the 1RM in older adults to improve power.
  
Time 
No specific duration of training has been identified for effectiveness.
  
Type 
Resistance exercises involving each major muscle group are recommended. A variety of exercise equipment and/or body weight can be used to 
perform these exercises.
  
Repetitions 
8–12 repetitions are recommended to improve strength and power in most adults. 10–15 repetitions are effective in improving strength in middle-
aged and older persons starting exercise 15–20 repetitions are recommended to improve muscular endurance.
  
Sets 
Two to four sets are the recommended for most adults to improve strength and power. A single set of resistance exercise can be effective especially 
among older and novice exercisers. ≤2 sets are effective in improving muscular endurance.
  
Pattern 
Rest intervals of 2–3 min between each set of repetitions are effective.
A rest of ≥48 hours between sessions for any single muscle group is recommended.
  
Progression 
A gradual progression of greater resistance and/or more repetitions per set and/or increasing frequency is recommended.
Flexibility exercise† 
  
Frequency
≥2–3 day/week is effective in improving joint range of motion, with the greatest gains occurring with daily exercise.
  
Intensity 
Stretch to the point of feeling tightness or slight discomfort.
  
Time 
Holding a static stretch for 10–30 s is recommended for most adults. In older persons, holding a stretch for 30–60 s may confer greater benefit. 
For PNF stretching, a 3–6 s contraction at 20%–75% maximum voluntary contraction followed by a 10–30 s assisted stretch is desirable.
  
Type 
A series of flexibility exercises for each of the major muscle–tendon units is recommended. Static flexibility (active or passive), dynamic flexibility, 
ballistic flexibility and PNF are each effective.
  
Volume 
A reasonable target is to perform 60 s of total stretching time for each flexibility exercise.
  
Pattern 
Repetition of each flexibility exercise two to four times is recommended. Flexibility exercise is most effective when the muscle is warmed through 
light to moderate aerobic activity or passively through external methods such as moist heat packs or hot baths.
  
Progression 
Methods for optimal progression are unknown.
Neuromotor exercise training† 
  
Frequency
≥2–3 days/week is recommended.
  
Intensity
An effective intensity of neuromotor exercise has not been determined.
  
Time
≥20–30 min/day may be needed.
  
Type
Exercises involving motor skills (eg, balance, agility, coordination and gait), proprioceptive exercise training and multifaceted activities (eg, tai ji and 
yoga) are recommended for older persons to improve and maintain physical function and reduce falls in those at risk for falling. The effectiveness of 
neuromuscular exercise training in younger and middle-aged persons has not been established, but there is probable benefit.
  
Volume 
The optimal volume (eg, number of repetitions, intensity) is not known.

Recommendation
develop evidence-based recommendations on PA-promotion and 
-delivery in the management of people with iA and OA and (3) 
formulate an educational and research agenda.
These EULAR recommendations for PA in people with iA and 
OA are for HCPs, patient organisations and policy makers.
MetHods
The EULAR standardised operating procedures for the develop-
ment of recommendations were followed.16 The AGREE II-in-
strument17 was used to structure this manuscript.
The multidisciplinary TF consisted of a selection of 22 Euro-
pean PA-experts (six medical doctors, including three rheuma-
tologists, one of them specialised in cardiovascular diseases, one 
GP), one orthopaedic surgeon; nine PTs, a psychologist, an OT, a 
nurse and a human movement scientist) and three patient repre-
sentatives. A steering group managed the process (convenor KN, 
methodologist TVV
, expert JB, fellow AR).
During the first TF meeting, definitions of exercise and PA were 
clarified and the TF agreed to follow the ACSM position stand.2 
The TF agreed that RA and SpA as predominant iA conditions, 
and HOA/KOA as most relevant for PA recommendations would 
represent the field of iA and OA, respectively. Clinically relevant 
questions on the provision of advice and guidance regarding 
exercise and PA, from which 13 research questions were defined 
by consensus to guide the subsequent detailed systematic litera-
ture review (SLR) (online supplementary table S1).
T
wo SLRs were performed by AR with the support of two 
librarians and under the supervision of the convenor and meth-
odologists. The questions were written according to the Popu-
lation, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) format,18 
resulting in two PICOs: (1) on effectiveness, safety and feasibility 
of PA and (2) on facilitators and barriers towards PA (online-sup-
plementary table S2). For the first PICO, the fellow searched for 
key meta-analyses (MAs) or systematic reviews (SRs) including 
randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the effec-
tiveness of PA-interventions in adults with RA/SpA/HOA/KOA. 
The SLR was performed in PubMed/Medline, Cochrane Library, 
Embase, Web of Science, Emcare and PsycInfo, using both MeSH 
terms and freetext, covering the time frame until 4/2017. For the 
second PICO, a SLR, covering the time frame until 7/2017, was 
performed in PubMed/Medline and Cochrane Library including 
qualitative studies if they described facilitators and barriers 
regarding PA (including exercise) in people with RA/SpA/HOA/
KOA. Experts in the field of RA (EH), SpA (HD), OA (CJ) and 
behaviour change (KK), respectively, checked if all relevant titles 
and abstracts were included.
Based on the PICOs, the same author (AR) screened the titles 
and abstracts according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
Potentially relevant articles were identified and full text versions 
evaluated. Studies including adults (>18 years) with RA/SpA/
HOA/KOA that included PA interventions that met the PH 
recommendations according to the ACSM principles2 regarding 
frequency, intensity and duration for effective interventions 
were eligible for inclusion. All data extractions were checked by 
experts from the TF.
Studies measuring the effectiveness of PA-interventions 
were meta-analysed. These results and detailed descriptions of 
the methods are reported elsewhere.19 Studies were used for 
answering more than one research question if appropriate. For 
clinical studies evaluating the effectiveness of PA, the Cochrane 
Risk of Bias Assessment Tool was used to assess selection bias, 
performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias and reporting 
bias20 by two independent assessors (AR, CH). An additional 
person (KN) helped to resolve any differences in rating between 
the assessors. The research evidence was categorised according 
to the Oxford levels of evidence.21
During the second TF meeting, the results from the SLR 
were presented, and the experts developed ‘overarching prin-
ciples’ (background statements to preface recommendations) 
and drafted 10 recommendations through an iterative process of 
discussion and consensus. After the meeting, the recommenda-
tions were collated and sent to the TF members by email, to rate 
the level of agreement (LoA) independently and anonymously on 
a 0–10 point scale (0=totally disagree, 10=totally agree). Mean 
LoA >8 
would be considered a ‘high’ LoA. Furthermore, the TF 
formulated a research agenda and education agenda based on 
identified gaps in the evidence.
Results
The search yielded 3471 references, 96 of which were included 
in the SLR: Four MA/SR7 22–24 and 66 RCTs25–93 investigated the 
effects of exercise interventions, 11 RCTs94–106 investigated the 
effects of a PA-promotion-intervention, 11 qualitative studies 
and literature reviews3 11 107–115 described barriers and facilitators 
regarding PA (figure 1A,B). The included RCTs were published 
between 1985 and 2017. Most information is from studies with 
low (48%) or unclear (39%) risk of bias (online-supplementary 
figure S1).
The TF agreed on four overarching principles and 10 recom-
mendations for PA in people with RA/SpA/HOA/KOA based on 
SLR and expert opinion. High loA was achieved for 9 out of 
10 recommendations and 2 recommendations were graded as 
strength level A. Table 2 summarises the overarching principles 
and recommendations with their associated level of evidence, 
strength of recommendation and LoA.
Recommendation 1: PA as integral part of standard care
Given the evidence for effectiveness, feasibility and safety, 
the PH recommendations for PA are applicable, and thus, 
PA should be an integral part of standard care for people 
with RA/SpA/HOA/KOA. PA according to PH recommen-
dations2 is effective on PA level, physical fitness as well as 
disease-specific and general outcomes in people with RA/
SpA/HOA/KOA (category l evidence16). Our MA including 
16 RCTs26 35 36 42 43 50 54 56 57 61 70 showed that cardiovascular exer-
cises have a moderate beneficial effect on cardiovascular fitness

Recommendation
(evaluated in VO2 max) in all three conditions. Our MA including 
25 RCTs25 28 31 34 38 39 44 47 49–51 59 62–66 72 75–78 81–83 85 86 88 90 91 
showed that muscle strength exercises have a moderate bene-
ficial effect for muscle strength in people with RA and HOA/
KOA. Our MA including seven RCTs52 55 58 78 88 90 116 showed 
that combined exercises (aerobic or strength exercises plus flex-
ibility exercises) had no effect on flexibility in people with SpA 
or HOA/KOA. However, exercise conditions, assessments and 
outcome measures varied greatly. There is no study comparing 
the effect of flexibility exercises alone versus no exercises. In 
one RCT,48 the effect of a neuromotor-exercise programme on 
neuromotor performance was investigated in people with RA 
showing a positive effect. Eleven RCTs described the promotion 
of daily PA. Our MA including six RCTs95 98 101 102 104 117 applying 
BCTs for the counselling intervention showed a small beneficial 
effect.
Feasibility of interventions can be captured by adherence to 
the intervention or the study protocol.118 Adherence to inter-
ventions (number of sessions attended/total number of sessions) 
has been reported in 26 RCTs (35%) and the mean adherence 
was 69% in people with SpA, 71% in people with RA and 79% 
in people with HOA/KOA. However, the (self-) reported adher-
ence to intervention might be overestimated due to recall bias or 
social desirability. In 68 RCTs (94%), protocol violations were 
reported, with approximately 10% of these being disease-related 
or intervention-related.
PH recommendations for PA can be considered safe. No detri-
mental effects were reported, rather beneficial effects on disease 
activity and symptoms in iA.7 Forty-four per cent of all included 
RCTs reported on adverse events (AE), of those 62% described 
no AE and 38% describe minor AE such as transitional exercise 
related joint or muscle pain.

Recommendation
Recommendation 2: Responsibility for PA promotion
All HCPs should have a responsibility for PA promotion and collab-
orative working that facilitate a close cooperation between different 
professions to support appropriate disease management. This state-
ment was based on the finding that 66% of the included studies 
reported the profession of the HCP providing the intervention, of 
which 75% were PT
s.25 31 36 40 44 45 48 50 53 55 58 61 64–66 70 73–79 81 84 87 88 
91 94 96 101–105 119 120 However, the functions and responsibilities of 
HCPs vary across Europe.121 122 Therefore, the TF agreed that PA 
advice should be provided by all HCPs.
Recommendation 3: delivery of PA
The delivery of interventions should be performed by HCPs 
competent in the field of PA principles and rheumatic conditions. 
The reporting of training on PA guidelines was rare. One study59 
described a ‘4 
hours education session on cardiovascular training’, 
others described the instructing person as ‘trained’25 50 69 70 84 88 123 
or ‘experienced’.31 49 76 77 88 Some studies with focus on the promo-
tion of daily PA described training sessions on behaviour change 
skills like Motivational Interviewing.94 96 104
Recommendation 4: evaluation of PA
The PA level (active or non-active) and the exercise domains 
(cardiorespiratory, muscle strength, flexibility and neuromotor) 
should be routinely assessed. Of 11 trials investigating the effect 
of PA promotion interventions, three RCTs94 96 105 described 
baseline screening to distinguish between active and non-active 
persons before starting the tailored PA-intervention. Specific 
tools are needed to assess each domain.15,p. 68
Recommendation 5: General and disease-specific 
contraindications
Tools for specific contraindications (CIs) were found;15 94 124 
however, available general or national guidelines defining abso-
lute or relative CIs should be followed as a priority.
Recommendation 6: Personalised aims and evaluation
The PA-interventions should be based on individual aims, which 
should be regularly evaluated. This can be done by PA assess-
ments and any other assessments related to the individual aims. 
As PA assessments, performance–based tests, patient-reported 
outcome measures (eg, SQUASH,104 PASE94) and self-monitoring

overarching principles 
1. PA is part of a general concept to optimise health related quality of life.
2. PA has health benefits for people with RA/SpA/HOA/KOA.
3. General PA recommendations, including the four domains (cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, flexibility and neuromotor performance) are applicable (feasible and 
safe) to people with RA/OA/SpA.
4. The planning of PA requires a shared decision between healthcare providers and people with RA/SpA/HOA/KOA, which takes people’s preferences, capabilities and resources 
into account.

Recommendation
tools (eg, wearables such as Fitbit,100 pedometer99 or acceler-
ometer101) were identified. However, we did not evaluate the 
validity and reliability of the assessments applied.
Recommendation 7: General and disease-specific barriers and 
facilitators
General and disease-specific barriers (that are not CI per 
se) and facilitators should be addressed as described in 11 
studies.11 107–115 125 Disease-specific barriers included lack of 
knowledge about the disease, lack of knowledge about safe exer-
cising (both in people with iA/OA and HCPs) and symptoms 
like pain, fatigue, stiffness, reduced mobility, fear of flare-ups 
or causing damage. Disease-specific facilitators included positive 
impact of exercise in symptoms or disease control, information 
about disease and correct exercising, the use medication for pain 
prior to exercising, using self-regulation techniques, supportive, 
but not controlling encouragement from HCPs and a supportive 
social background.
Recommendation 8: Individual adaptations to PA following 
individualised assessment
Adaptations to PA should be made on a comprehensive individual 
assessment. However, no evidence on the necessity of general 
adaptations in people with RA/SpA/HOA/KOA was found. In 
some RA studies the ‘24 hour-rule’ was applied, that is, the exer-
cise intensity was reduced when the increased pain persisted for 
more than 24 
hours.23 40 50 ACSM provides adaptations to exer-
cise testing in people with arthritis (eg, no high-intensity testing 
if acute inflammation) and training such as exercising when pain 
is typically least severe or to train carefully in order to reduce risk 
of associated injuries, although no clear evidence that high-im-
pact activities cannot be engaged during active inflammation.15, 
pp. 298–301 Individual disease-related barriers (eg, symptoms) may 
determine these adaptations.
Recommendation 9: behaviour change techniques
BCTs should be an integral component of PA-interventions. 
Several behaviour change theories were used in PA promotion 
interventions in the field of RA and HOA/KOA,4 126 but the 
reporting was poor. Future research based on theories in design, 
evaluation and interpretation of findings is needed.
A meta-analysis of six RCTs94 95 98 101 102 104 investigating the 
effects of a PA promotion intervention according to general PA 
recommendations2 and based on counselling interventions that 
apply BCTs showed a small beneficial effect on PA level.19 Coun-
selling interventions show a small beneficial effect if BCTs are 
applied.19
Recommendation 10: Modes of delivery
HCPs should consider the whole range of modes to deliver inter-
ventions. No evidence on the superiority of specific delivery 
modes was found. The delivery modes of PA-interventions 
vary considerably and are mostly described as ‘land-based and/
or water-based’ and ‘supervised and individualised’, the latter 
usually applied to group settings. As booster strategies phone 
calls,36 96 98 105 devices (eg, pedometer,98 99 wearable100 101), home 
visits,63 70 log book,36 51 76 98 web-based instructions,127 written 
material,51 54 103 visual instructions (eg, video103) were reported.
Research and education agendas
Based on the gaps identified in the literature, the TF discussed 
and proposed a research agenda (box 1) with the prioritised 
research topics and an education agenda (box 2) with topics for 
education and training in PA promotion for HCPs. Evidence 
on impact of (reducing) sedentary behaviour emerged as an 
important future research topic.
dIscussIon
The TF agreed on 4 overarching principles and 10 recom-
mendations for PA in people with RA/SpA/HOA/KOA, which 
integrated the perspectives of the TF members from different 
professional, cultural and personal backgrounds. This led to a 
broad consensus on the principles and recommendations within 
the group and ought to foster its feasibility and practicability in 
the diverging health systems across Europe.
box 1 Research agenda for physical activity (PA) in 
people with inflammatory arthritis and osteoarthritis
1. To evaluate the long-term effectiveness of PA at different 
intensities and types and monitoring of adverse events (AE).
2. To evaluate links between PA behaviour and disease-specific 
outcomes.
3. To evaluate the long-term effectiveness of sedentary 
behaviour reduction, including the monitoring of AE.
4. To evaluate links between sedentary behaviour and disease-
specific outcomes.
5. To identify which PA-intervention strategies work best to 
increase PA level and adherence in various subgroups.
6. To identify markers of response and non-response to PA 
treatment.
7. To identify disease-specific contraindications on different 
exercise domains (cardiovascular, strength, flexibility, 
neuromotor).
8. To further develop and evaluate strategies to reduce and 
monitor a change in sedentary behaviour.
9. To develop PA-interventions targeting all exercise 
dimensions simultaneously with special focus on feasibility.
10. To evaluate and recommend valid PA assessments feasible 
for the use in clinical practice.
11. To study how to facilitate PA behaviour change immediately 
from screening onwards and how to address facilitators and 
barriers.
12. To identify facilitators and barriers of healthcare providers 
towards applying the PA recommendations.
13. To perform long-term effectiveness trials on combined 
interventions including other health behaviours.
box 2 education agenda for physical activity (PA) in 
people with inflammatory arthritis and osteoarthritis
1. Increase knowledge about PA among health professionals 
(HPs), physicians and people with inflammatory arthritis and 
osteoarthritis.
2. Increase HPs’ and physicians’ skills in communicating the role 
of PA in managing general health and disease-specific issues.
3. Include knowledge and skills on PA promotion in all HPs’ and 
physicians’ undergraduate training curricula.
4. Develop a EULAR training module on PA for HPs and 
rheumatologists.
5. Propose a session on PA at every EULAR congress.
6. Develop education materials for people with inflammatory 
arthritis and osteoarthritis.

Recommendation
The LoA on the recommendations among the TF members 
was very high. The only exception was about the competency 
of HCP
, which may be due to country specific differences in the 
availability of HCP competent in PA promotion.
Although the PH recommendations for PA are well estab-
lished, the feasibility and applicability of these for people with 
iA and OA has not been assessed so far. Accordingly, the devel-
opment of the recommendations was needed. Expectedly, they 
emphasise the importance of PA and will guide future PA-inter-
ventions in people with chronic rheumatic conditions.
PA promotion is a behavioural intervention and therefore 
BCT are central components in PA-interventions. Identifying 
effective and cost-effective BCT within PA promotion interven-
tion in people with chronic conditions is currently a hot topic 
in research and for example a research priority of the National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence, UK.128
We decided a priori to include only studies fulfilling the 
PH recommendations for PA according to ACSM principles.2 
This was a far-reaching decision, which allowed drawing 
stronger conclusions on the effectiveness and especially the 
safety of correctly dosed PA-interventions. We followed a 
pragmatic search strategy with the plan to answer all RQs 
related to PICO 1 with findings of available SR/MA. However, 
there were no SR/MA on all exercise dimensions and all 
conditions available; this led to extracting single RCTs from 
high-quality SR/MA. This, however, excluded high-quality 
reviews (eg, Cochrane reviews) and RCTs that did not fulfil 
the ACSM principles and affected the potential to report 1A 
evidence according to Oxford levels of evidence.21 Further-
more, only one reviewer screened the abstracts and decided 
on unclear abstracts together with a second reviewer, which 
is not fully in line with standard procedures of a SLR.129 
However, we applied a double-check by experts to ensure 
that no relevant studies were missed.
A major problem for data extraction and interpretation 
was that the reporting of interventions in most studies 
was incomplete. Manuscripts that applied TIDieR130 
(Template for Intervention Description and Replication) 
guidelines reported more precisely the PA-interventions 
and substantially improved the objective evaluation of the 
PA-interventions.
For the research questions related to the effectiveness and 
safety of PA-interventions and BCT, the PICO scheme was 
applied, resulting in 1A level of evidence. All other research 
questions we had to answer in a descriptive way limiting the 
level of evidence to 3 to 4. However, this limitation is due to 
the nature of the research questions. Nevertheless, the qual-
itative studies may provide valuable insight into important 
PA-related fields, such as assessments, barriers and facilita-
tors, PA promotion strategies.
The recommendations focused on the conditions RA/SpA/
HOA/KOA, the most prevalent RMD conditions to increase 
the generalisability and applicability of the recommendations. 
However, large heterogeneity between these conditions may 
limit the precision of the recommendations. Therefore, addi-
tional disease-specific recommendations are desirable. In addi-
tion, not all subconditions were considered and represented (eg, 
juvenile arthritis).
The research agenda highlights several areas where scientific 
evidence is lacking. It is a clear ambition to implement these 
recommendations into daily clinical routine. Due to the different 
health systems across Europe, development and evaluation of 
target group and culture-specific implementation strategies are 
needed and should involve all stakeholders.
