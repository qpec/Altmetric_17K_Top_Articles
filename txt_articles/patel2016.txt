The burden of mental, neurological, and substance use (MNS) disorders increased by 41% between 1990 and 2010 and 
now accounts for one in every 10 lost years of health globally. This sobering statistic does not take into account the 
substantial excess mortality associated with these disorders or the social and economic consequences of MNS disorders 
on aff
 ected persons, their caregivers, and society. A wide variety of eff
 ective interventions, including drugs, psychological 
treatments, and social interventions, can prevent and treat MNS disorders. At the population-level platform of service 
delivery, best practices include legislative measures to restrict access to means of self-harm or suicide and to reduce the 
availability of and demand for alcohol. At the community-level platform, best practices include parenting programmes 
in infancy and life-skills training in schools to build social and emotional competencies. At the health-care-level 
platform, we identify three delivery channels. Two of these delivery channels are especially relevant from a public 
health perspective: self-management (eg, web-based psychological therapy for depression and anxiety disorders) and 
primary care and community outreach (eg, non-specialist health worker delivering psychological and pharmacological 
management of selected disorders). The third delivery channel, hospital care, which includes specialist services for 
MNS disorders and fi
 rst-level hospitals providing other types of services (such as general medicine, HIV, or paediatric 
care), play an important part for a smaller proportion of cases with severe, refractory, or emergency presentations and 
for the integration of mental health care in other health-care channels, respectively. The costs of providing a signifi
 cantly 
scaled up package of specifi
 ed cost-eff
 ective interventions for prioritised MNS disorders in low-income and lower-
middle-income countries is estimated at US$3–4 per head of population per year. Since a substantial proportion of 
MNS disorders run a chronic and disabling course and adversely aff
 ect household welfare, intervention costs should 
largely be met by government through increased resource allocation and fi
 nancial protection measures (rather than 
leaving households to pay out-of-pocket). Moreover, a policy of moving towards universal public fi
 nance can also be 
expected to lead to a far more equitable allocation of public health resources across income groups. Despite this 
evidence, less than 1% of development assistance for health and government spending on health in low-income and 
middle-income countries is allocated to the care of people with these disorders. Achieving the health gains associated 
with prioritised interventions will require not just fi
 nancial resources, but committed and sustained eff
 orts to address 
a range of other barriers (such as paucity of human resources, weak governance, and stigma). Ultimately, the goal is to 
massively increase opportunities for people with MNS disorders to access services without the prospect of 
discrimination or impoverishment and with the hope of attaining optimal health and social outcomes.
Introduction
The primary goal of Disease Control Priorities in 
Developing Countries, fi
 rst published by the World Bank 
in 1993, is to synthesise evidence of the burden of 
specifi
 c health disorders and, more importantly, the 
relative eff
 ectiveness and cost-eff
 ectiveness of inter-
ventions so as to assist decision makers in allocating 
often tightly constrained budgets and ensuring that 
health system objectives are maximally achieved. The 
third edition of Disease Control Priorities (DCP-3) aims to 
provide up-to-date evidence and includes several novel 
features that build on previous editions, for example by 
addressing how interventions can be packaged together 
across a range of delivery platforms and channels 
(appendix p 1).1 Here we describe the key fi
 ndings of the 
evidence related to mental, neurological, and substance 
use (MNS) disorders.
MNS disorders are a heterogeneous range of disorders 
that owe their origin to a complex array of genetic, 
biological, psychological, and social factors. Although 
many health systems deliver care for these disorders 
through separate channels, with an emphasis on specialist 
services in hospitals, the disorders have been grouped 
together here because they share several important 
characteristics, notably: all owe their symptoms and 
impairments to some degree of brain dysfunction; social 
determinants play an important part in the aetiology and 
symptom expression (panel 1);2,3 they frequently co-occur 
in the same individual; their eff
 ect on families and wider 
society is profound; they are strongly associated with 
stigma and discrimination; they often take a chronic or 
relapsing course; and they all share a pitifully inadequate 
response from health-care systems in all countries, but 
particularly in low-income and middle-income countries. 
This grouping is also consistent with the DCP-3 goals of 
synthesising evidence and making recommendations 
across diverse health disorders and with WHO’s Mental 
Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP).4

In DCP-3, we have considered interventions for 
fi
 ve groups of disorders (adult mental disorders, child 
mental and developmental disorders, neurological 
disorders, alcohol use disorder, and illicit drug use 
disorders) and for suicide and self-harm, a health outcome 
strongly associated with MNS disorders. Within each 
group, we have prioritised disorders that are associated 
with high burden and for which evidence exists in support 
of interventions that are cost eff
 ective and scalable. 
Inevitably, such an approach does not address a substantial 
number of disorders (eg, multiple sclerosis as a 
neurological disorder and anorexia nervosa as an adult 
mental disorder), but our recommendations could be 
extended to several other disorders that have not been 
expressly addressed, in particular with respect to the 
delivery of packages for care. Additionally, some important 
MNS disorders or concerns are covered in other volumes 
of the DCP-3 series, notably, nicotine dependence, early 
child development, neurological infections, and stroke.
In this report, we address fi
 ve themes. First, we address 
the question of why MNS disorders deserve prioritisation 
by pointing to and reviewing the health and economic 
burden of disease attributable to MNS disorders. Second, 
we review the evidence of the eff
 ectiveness of specifi
 c 
interventions for the prevention and treatment of the 
selected MNS disorders. Third, we consider how 
and where these interventions can be appropriately 
implemented across a range of service delivery platforms. 
Fourth, we examine the cost of scaling up cost-eff
 ective 
interventions and the case for enhanced service coverage 
and fi
 nancial protection for people with MNS disorders. 
Finally, we consider the barriers and strategies for 
successful scale-up.
Why MNS disorders matter for global health
The Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD 2010)5 
identifi
 ed MNS disorders as signifi
 cant causes of the 
world’s disease burden. We use GBD 2010 data to 
investigate trends in the burden due to MNS disorders. 
Between 1990 and 2010, absolute disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs) due to MNS disorders rose by 41%, 
from 182 million DALYs to 258 million DALYs (the 
proportion of global disease burden increased from 
7·3% to 10·4%). With the exception of substance use 
disorders, which increased in prevalence with time, this 
increase in MNS-related DALYs was largely due to 
population growth and ageing. As a group, MNS 
disorders were the leading cause of years lived with 
disability (YLDs) globally (fi
 gure 1). DALYs from MNS 
disorders were highest during early-to-mid-adulthood, 
explaining 18·6% of total DALYs in individuals aged 
15–49 years as opposed to 10·4% at all ages combined. 
DALYs from neurological disorders were highest in 
elderly people. The burden of these disorders contains 
important gender diff
 erences: men accounted for more 
DALYs from mental disorders occurring in childhood, 
schizophrenia, substance use disorders, Parkinson’s 
disease, and epilepsy, whereas more DALYs accrue to 
women for all other disorders in this group. The relative 
proportion of DALYs from MNS disorders to overall 
disease burden was estimated to be 1·6 times higher in 
developed regions (15·5% of total DALYs) than in 
Figure 1: Proportion of global YLDs and YLLs attributable to mental, neurological, and substance use 
disorders, 2010
YLLs=years lost to premature mortality. YLDs=years lived with disability. In GBD 2010 injuries included deaths and 
YLLs due to suicide. Mental and substance use disorders explained 22·5 million suicide YLLs, equivalent to 62·1% 
of suicide YLLs or 1·3% of total all cause YLLs.6 Source: Whiteford et al (2015)7 and http://vizhub.healthdata.org/

Panel 1: The social determinants of mental, neurological, and substance use (MNS) 
disorders
A range of social determinants aff
 ect the risk and outcome of MNS disorders. In particular, 
the following factors have been shown to be associated with several MNS disorders2:
• 
Demographic factors such as age, sex, and ethnicity
• 
Socioeconomic status:  
low income, unemployment, income inequality, low 
education, low social support
• 
Neighborhood factors: inadequate housing, over-crowding, neighborhood violence
• 
Environmental events: natural disasters, war, confl
 ict, climate change, and migration
• 
Social change associated with changes in income, urbanisation, and environmental 
degradation
The causal mechanisms of the social determinants of MNS disorders indicate a cyclical 
pattern: on one hand, socioeconomic adversities increase risk for MNS disorders (the 
social causation pathway); on the other hand, people living with MNS disorders drift into 
poverty during the course of their life through increased health-care expenditure, reduced 
economic productivity associated with disability, and stigma and discrimination 
associated with these disorders (the social drift pathway).
Understanding the vicious cycle of social determinants and MNS disorders provides 
opportunities for interventions that target both social causation and social drift. In relation 
to social causation, the evidence for the mental health benefi
 ts of poverty alleviation 
interventions is mixed but growing. In relation to social drift, the evidence for the 
individual and household economic benefi
 ts of MNS disorder prevention and treatment is 
compelling, and supports the economic argument for scaling up these interventions.3

developing regions (9·4% of total DALYs), largely due to 
the relatively higher burden of other health disorders 
such as infectious and perinatal diseases in developing 
regions. Because of the larger population in low-income 
and middle-income countries, however, absolute DALYs 
from MNS disorders are higher than in high-income 
countries.
Burden due to premature mortality according to GBD 
2010 might incorrectly lead to the interpretation that 
premature death in people with MNS disorders is 
inconsequential. This is because of how causes of deaths 
are assigned in the International Classifi
 cation of 
Diseases (ICD) death-coding system used by GBD 2010. 
Yet, evidence shows that people with MNS disorders 
have a signifi
 cant reduction in life expectancy, with risk 
of mortality increasing with disorder severity.8–10 
Consequently, we also explore diff
 erences between GBD 
2010 estimates of cause-specifi
 c and excess mortality 
from these disorders and potential contributors to 
life-expectancy gaps. Although reported years of life lost 
(YLLs) accounted for only 15·3% of DALYs from MNS 
disorders, equivalent to 840 000 deaths, natural history 
models generated by DisMod-MR estimate that sub-
stantially more deaths could be associated with these 
disorders.11 Excess deaths from major depression alone 
were estimated at more than 2·2 million in 2010. This 
number is signifi
 cantly higher than other attempts to 
quantify the same10 and potentially indicates a much 
higher degree of mortality associated with MNS disorders 
than that captured by the assessment of YLLs in GBD 
2010. However, because these estimates of excess deaths 
included deaths from both causal and non-causal origins, 
they must be interpreted with caution. In relation to 
excess deaths presented in table 1, comparative risk 
analyses12 have also highlighted mental and substance 
use disorders as signifi
 cant risk factors of premature 
death from a range of other health outcomes. For 
example, an estimated 60% of suicide deaths can be 
reattributed to mental and substance use disorders, 
which would elevate them from the fi
 fth to the third 
leading cause of burden of disease.6

consequences of MNS disorders, not only for aff

losses.14 The global cost of dementia in 2010 has been 
estimated to be $604 billion, equivalent to 1% of global 
GDP.15 Additionally, a rising tide of social adversities are 
recognised to be associated with MNS disorders, with 
large and growing proportions of the global population 
aff
 ected 
by 
confl
 ict 
or 
displacement 
due 
to 
environmental degradation and climate change, which 
bodes for a grim forecast on the future burden of these 
disorders. Finally, disease burden estimates do not 
account for the substantial hazards faced by persons 
with MNS disorders who face the systematic denial of 
basic human rights, ranging from limited opportunities 
for education and employment and extending to torture 
and denial of freedom, sometimes within health-care 
institutions.16
What works? Eff
 ective interventions for the 
prevention and treatment of MNS disorders
The evidence on interventions builds on the recom-
mendations of the second edition of Disease Control 
Priorities (DCP-2)17–19 and is derived from several sources: 
the mhGAP guidelines developed by WHO for use in 
non-specialist health settings, which reviewed the 
literature published up to 2009 using the Grading of 
Recommendations 
Assessment, 
Development 
and 
Evaluation (GRADE);20 other recent reviews where 
appropriate (eg, Strang and colleagues [2012]21 for illicit 
drugs); interventions that required a specialist for delivery, 
but which had not been addressed by mhGAP or DCP-2, 
assessed using GRADE; and a review of all reviews, 
including systematic reviews, and any type of assessment 
evidence from a low-income and middle-income country 
published since mhGAP, assessed using GRADE. Our 
fi
 ndings are summarised in table 2.
A wide variety of eff
 ective interventions comprising 
drug-based, psychological, and social interventions can 
prevent and treat the range of the priority MNS disorders. 
As shown in table 2, a set of essential medicines (such as 
antipsychotic, antidepressant, and antiepileptic drugs) 
and essential psychosocial interventions (such as 
cognitive behavioural therapy and parent skills training) 
can be identifi
 ed for this group of disorders. Although 
very few curative interventions for any of these disorders 
exist, the severity and course of most disorders can be 
greatly attenuated by psychosocial treatment or generic 
formulations of essential drugs, including combination 
drugs tailored to the needs of the individual. A few 
patients with more severe, refractory, or emergency 
clinical presentations will need specialist interventions, 
such as inpatient care with expert nursing for acute 
psychosis, modifi
 ed electroconvulsive therapy for severe 
depression, or surgery for epilepsy. It is important to 
acknowledge that certain preventive interventions that 
are primarily intended to target disorders covered in

use or eff

disorders for which no highly eff
 ective treatments exists, 
such as autism and dementia, psychosocial interventions 
have been shown to eff
 ectively address their adverse 
social consequences and support family caregivers.
Despite this evidence, a large proportion of persons 
aff
 ected by MNS disorders do not have access to 
these interventions. The poor adoption of eff
 ective 
interventions is often aff
 ected by concerns about 
fi
 nancial resources, an issue that is now being addressed 
by a mounting evidence base in support of the 
eff
 ectiveness of delivery by non-specialist health 
workers22 as well as their cost-eff
 ectiveness.23 A related 
resource constraint relates to the low availability of 
appropriately trained mental health workers. Cultural 
attitudes and beliefs might also pose specifi
 c barriers; 
for example, the symptoms associated with depression 
or anxiety disorders are commonly interpreted as being 
normative consequences of social adversity, and proven 
biomedical causal models are rare, leading to low 
demand for care and low visibility of the disorder from 
the view of health policy makers and providers.24 These 
competing views will clearly aff
 ect the societal 
preference for and acceptability of investment in the 
wider adoption of eff
 ective interventions for MNS 
disorders. More generally, stigma, poor awareness, and 
discrimination are major factors behind the low levels 
of political commitment and the paucity of demand for 
care for people with MNS disorders in many 
populations.25
How to deliver eff
 ective interventions?
The implementation of evidence-based interventions for 
MNS disorders seldom occurs through the delivery of 
single vertical interventions. More frequently, these 
interventions are delivered via so-called platforms—the 
level of the health or welfare system at which interventions 
or packages can be most appropriately, eff
 ectively, and 
effi
  ciently delivered. A specifi
 c delivery channel (such as a 
school or a primary health-care centre) can be viewed as 
the vehicle for delivery of a particular intervention on 
a specifi
 ed platform. Identifi
 cation of the set of inter-
ventions that fall within the realm of a particular delivery 
channel or platform is of interest and relevance to decision 
makers because it enables potential opportunities, 
synergies, and effi
  ciencies to be identifi
 ed. The 
identifi
 cation of interventions that are relevant for a 
particular platform also refl
 ects how resources are often 
allocated in practice (eg, to schools or primary health-care 
services rather than to specifi
 c interventions or disorders). 
We identifi
 ed three broad platforms to deliver interventions 
for MNS disorders: population, community, and health-
care platforms. Although a fair amount of good evidence 
from high-income countries exists in support of 
interventions across these platforms and along the 
continuum of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention, 
the evidence base is far less robust for low-income and 
middle-income countries. Recom 
mendations for best 
practice interventions and good practice interventions for 
these platforms are set out in the table in fi
 gure 2. Best 
practice interventions were identifi
 ed on the basis of 
evidence for their eff
 ectiveness and contextual acceptability 
and scalability in low-income and middle-income 
countries, plus evidence of their cost-eff
 ectiveness, at least 
in high-income countries; good practice interventions 
were identifi
 ed on the basis of suffi
  cient evidence of their 
eff
 ectiveness in high-income countries or promising 
evidence of their eff
 ectiveness in low-income and 
middle-income countries, or both. That evidence of 
cost-eff
 ectiveness does not exist for most interventions 
in low-income and middle-income countries refl
 ects 
the absence of evidence rather than the absence of 
cost-eff
 ectiveness.
Population platform interventions typically apply to 
the entire population and primarily address the 
promotion of population mental health, prevention of 
MNS disorders, and demand side barriers such as 
stigma. Best practice packages include legislative and 
regulatory measures to restrict access to means of self-
harm or suicide (notably pesticides) and reduce the 
availability of and demand for alcohol (eg, through 
increased taxes on alcohol products). Good practice 
packages include interventions aimed at raising mental 
health literacy and reducing stigma and discrimination. 
The criminal justice system off
 ers an important channel 
for delivery of interventions for a range of MNS 
disorders, notably those associated with alcohol and 
illicit drug use, behaviour disorders in adolescents, and 
the psychoses. Other preventive and promotion 
interventions do not require such a population-wide 
approach and are best delivered by targeting a group of 
people in the community who share a certain 
characteristic or are part of a particular setting; this 
platform is referred to as the community. Best practice 
packages at the community level include life-skills 
training to build social and emotional competencies in 
children and adolescents, and good practice packages 
include parenting programmes for parents with infants 
to promote early child development. Several other good 
practice packages are reported in fi
 gure 2.
The health-care platform comprises three specifi
 c 
delivery channels: self-management and care, primary 
health care, and hospital care. Examples of best or 
good practice packages for self-care include the 
self-management of disorders, such as migraine, and

others might need maintenance care for several years (eg, when there is a 
relapsing course).

Panel 2: Country case studies on scaling up interventions for mental, neurological, and substance use disorders
The 686 Project: China30
The Central Government Support for the Local Management 
and Treatment of Severe Mental Illnesses Project was initiated 
in 2004 with the fi
 rst fi
 nancial allotment of ¥6·86 million 
(US$829 000 in 2004), as a result of which, it was 
subsequently referred to as the 686 Project. Modelled on 
WHO’s recommended method for integration of hospital-
based and community-based mental health services, this 
programme provides care for a range of severe mental 
disorders through the delivery of community-based packages 
by multidisciplinary teams. The interventions are functionality 
oriented and are delivered through free outpatient treatment 
through insurance coverage (New Rural Cooperative Medical 
Care system) along with subsidised inpatient treatment for 
poor patients. The programme covered 30% of the Chinese 
population by the end of 2011. Programme evaluation showed 
improved outcomes for the more than 280 000 registered 
patients as the proportion of patients with severe mental 
illnesses who did not suff
 er a relapse for 5 years or longer 
increased from a baseline of 67% to 90% along with large 
reductions in the rates of so-called creating disturbances and 
causing serious accidents. The programme investment by the 
Chinese Government amounted to ¥280 million in 2011, and 
its key innovations were the increase in the availability of 
human resources, including both the involvement of 
non-mental-health professionals and intensive capacity 
building, which have increased the number of psychiatrists in 
the country by one-third.
The National Depression Detection and Treatment 
Programme
Programme (Programa Nacional de Diagnóstico y 
Tratamiento de la Depresión): Chile
The National Depression Detection and Treatment 
Programme is a national mental health programme in Chile 
that integrates detection and treatment of depression in 
primary care. The programme is based on the scaling up of an 
evidence-based collaborative stepped-care intervention in 
which most patients diagnosed with depression are provided 
drugs and psychotherapy at the primary care clinics, whereas 
only severe cases are referred to specialists. Launched in 2001, 
the programme operates through a network of 500 primary 
care centres and presently covers 50% of Chile’s population. 
A large number of psychologists have been added to the 
primary care, with a 344% increase between 2003 and 2008. 
Enrolment of the patients has grown steadily, with about 
100 000–125 000 patients starting treatment each year from 
2004 to 2006, and nearly 170 000 patients starting treatment 
in 2007. Nationwide implementation of the programme has 
led to a greater use of health services by women and the less 
educated people, contributing to reduced health inequalities. 
The programme’s success can be attributed to the use of an 
evidence-based design that was made available to policy 
makers, teamwork and proactive leadership, strategic 
alliances across sectors, sustained investment and ring-
fencing new and essential fi
 nancial resources, programme 
institutionalisation, and sustained development of human 
resources that can implement the programme.
Building back better: Burundi31
Civil war in the last decade of 20th century and fi
 rst decade of 
this century resulted in widespread massacres and forceful 
migrations and internal displacement of about 1 million 
individuals in Burundi. To address this humanitarian crisis, 
HealthNet Transcultural Psychosocial Organization (TPO) 
started providing mental health services in Burundi in 2000 
when the then Ministry of Public Health had no mental health 
policy, plan, or mental health unit and almost all the psychiatric 
services were provided by one psychiatric hospital. HealthNet 
TPO fi
 rst assessed the needs and then built a network of 
psychosocial and mental health services in communities in the 
national capital, Bujumbura, and in seven of the country’s 
17 provinces. A new health worker cadre, the psychosocial 
worker, played a pivotal role in the delivery of these services. 
Substantial progress has been made in the past decade, with the 
government now supplying essential psychiatric drugs through 
its national drug distribution centre, and outpatient mental 
health clinics are established in several provincial hospitals. 
From 2000 to 2008, more than 27 000 people were helped by 
the newly established mental health and psychosocial service. 
Between 2006 and 2008, the mental health clinics in the 
provincial hospitals registered almost 10 000 people who 
received more than 60 000 consultations. Most (65%) of these 
people had epilepsy. In 2011, funding from the Dutch 
Government enabled HealthNet TPO and the Burundian 
Government to initiate a 5-year project aimed at strengthening 
health systems. One of the project’s components is the 
integration of mental health care into primary care using WHO’s 
Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) guidelines. The 
government has now established a National Commission for 
mental health, and appropriate steps are being taken to support 
provision of mental health care in general hospitals and follow-
up within the community.

non-specialist case manager who performs a range of 
tasks including screening, provision of psychosocial 
interventions, and proactive monitoring, liaising closely 
with and acting as a link between the patient, the primary 
care doctor, and specialist services.22,26 At the hospital 
level, fi
 rst-level hospitals, typically district hospitals, can 
off
 er a range of medical care services that provide 
integrated care for people with MNS disorders by 
implementing the same packages as recommended for 
the primary health-care channel, particularly in those 
domains where MNS disorders frequently co-occur, 
such as in maternal health, other non-communicable 
diseases, and HIV.27–29 In specialist services, which might 
either be off
 ered within fi
 rst-level hospitals or in separate 
specialist hospitals (such as psychiatric hospitals or 
alcohol and illicit drug treatment centres), interventions 
focus on the diagnosis and management of complex, 
refractory, and severe cases of MNS disorders, for 
example of psychosis, epilepsy, or alcohol use disorders. 
A small minority of individuals with MNS disorders 
would 
need 
ongoing 
care 
in 
community-based 
residential facilities because of their disability and lack 
of alternative sources of care and support. Community-
outreach teams that can provide variable levels of 
intensity of care appropriate for the individual’s needs 
have a crucial role because their support enables these 
individuals to function in an independent and supported 
way, in the community, alongside close liaison with 
general primary health-care services and other social 
and criminal justice services.
In humanitarian contexts and emergency-aff
 ected 
populations, such as those arising from confl
 ict or 
natural disaster, the humanitarian aid and emergency 
response platform is another delivery channel for 
much-needed mental health care. These populations are 
at an increased risk of MNS disorders, which can 
overwhelm the local capacity to respond, particularly if 
the existing infrastructure or health system was already 
weak or might have been rendered dysfunctional as a 
result of the emergency situation. There is a heightened 
need to identify and allocate resources for the provision 
of mental health care and psychosocial support in these 
settings, both for people with disorders induced by the 
emergency and for people with pre-existing disorders. In 
several countries, such emergencies have actually 
provided opportunities for systemic change or service 
reform in public mental health care (panel 2).33 Alongside 
eff
 orts to improve levels of contact coverage and bridge 
the treatment gap for people with MNS disorders, it is 
imperative to also enhance the quality of service delivery. 
Quality of care should not be subservient to the quantity 
of available and accessible services, not least since robust 
quality improvement mechanisms ensure effi
  cient use of 
limited resources, and good quality services build 
people’s confi
 dence in health care, thereby fuelling the 
demand and increasing use of preventive and treatment 
interventions.
How much will it cost? Universal health 
coverage for MNS disorders
For successful and sustainable scale-up of eff
 ective 
interventions and innovative service-delivery strategies 
(such as task-sharing and collaborative care), decision 
makers need not only evidence of an intervention’s eff
 ect 
on health, but also their costs and cost-eff
 ectiveness. 
Even when this cost-eff
 ectiveness evidence is available, 
the question remains of whether or how an intervention 
might confer wider economic and social benefi
 ts to 
households or society, such as restored productivity, 
reduced medical impoverishment, or greater equality. 
The methods used for our economic analyses included a 
review of existing cost-eff
 ectiveness evidence and 
exploratory analyses of the distributional and fi
 nancial 
protection eff
 ects of interventions (appendix p 2).
A small but growing economic evidence base exists 
to inform decision making in low-income and 
middle-income settings; this evidence base is mainly 
focused on the treatment of specifi
 c disorders such as 
epilepsy, alcohol use disorders, depression, and 
schizophrenia. Analysis undertaken at the global level 
(Panel 2 continued from previous page)
Suicide prevention through pesticide regulation: Sri Lanka32
In Sri Lanka as well as in other Asian countries, pesticide 
self-poisoning is one of the most common methods of suicide. 
Suicide rates in Sri Lanka increased eight times from 1950 to 
1995, and the country had the highest rate of suicide worldwide 
(about 47 per 100 000 population) during this period. A series 
of policy and legislative actions during this time reduced the 
suicide rates. Findings from an ecological analysis32 of trends in 
suicide and risk factors for suicide in Sri Lanka from 1975 to 
2005 suggests that the marked decrease in Sri Lanka’s suicide 
rates in the mid-1990s coincided with the culmination of a 
series of legislative activities that systematically banned the 
most toxic pesticides that had been responsible for most 
pesticide deaths in the preceding two decades. The Registrar of 
Pesticides banned methyl parathion and parathion in 1984 and 
gradually phased out all the remaining class I (the most toxic) 
organophosphate pesticides during the following years, 
culminating in July, 1995, with bans on the remaining class I 
pesticides monocrotphos and methamidophos. By 
December, 1998, endosulfan (a class II pesticide) was also 
banned as farmers had substituted class I pesticides with 
endosulfan. By 2005, suicide rates had been halved to about 
25 per 100 000 population. This case study underlines the fact 
that, in countries where pesticides are commonly used in acts of 
self-poisoning, regulatory controls on the sale of the most toxic 
pesticides could have a favourable eff
 ect on suicide.

by WHO, updated to 2012 values for DCP-3, reveals a 
marked variation in the cost per DALY averted, not only 
between diff
 erent regions of the world but also between 
diff
 erent disorders and interventions; fi
 gure 3 shows 
the range for the most cost-eff
 ective intervention 
identifi
 ed for each of the four disorders mentioned 
above (appendix p 3).18,23 Brief interventions for harmful 
alcohol use and treatment of epilepsy with fi
 rst-line 
antiepileptic drugs fall towards the lower (more 
favourable) end of cost per DALY averted, whereas 
community-based treatment of schizophrenia with 
fi
 rst-generation drugs and psychosocial care falls 
towards the upper end of cost per DALY averted. 
Estimates from comparable national studies in Brazil, 
Nigeria, and Thailand, again adjusted to 2012 values, 
fall in the range of $100–2000 per DALY averted.34–36 
With the exception of an analysis of alcohol-demand 
reduction measures—which estimated that one DALY 
could be averted for as little as $200–400 through 
increases in excise taxes on alcoholic beverages and for 
$200–1200 through comprehensive advertising bans 
or reduced availability of retail outlets37—hardly any 
published evidence exists on the cost-eff
 ectiveness of 
population-based or community-level strategies in or 
for low-income and middle-income settings.
The combined cost of implementing these alcohol-
control measures in low-income and middle-income 
settings has been estimated to be $0·10–0·30 per head.37 
A new cost analysis for DCP-3 estimates that a school-
based life-skills programme would cost $0·05–0·25 per 
head (appendix p 5). The annual cost of delivering a 
defi
 ned package of cost-eff
 ective interventions for schizo-
phrenia, depression, epilepsy, and alcohol use disorders 
in two WHO sub-regions (one in sub-Saharan Africa, the 
other in south Asia) has been estimated to be $3–4 per 
head.23 In more affl
  uent regions or in upper-
middle-income countries, the cost of such a package is 
expected to be at least double this amount (appendix p 3).
Beyond health improvement, other important goals or 
attributes of health systems can be considered, including 
equity and fi
 nancial protection. Since many MNS 
disorders run a chronic and disabling course, often go 
undetected, and are regularly omitted from essential 
packages of health care or insurance schemes, they pose 
a direct threat to the wellbeing and economic viability 
of households as a result of private out-of-pocket 
expenditures on health services and goods as well as 
diminished production or income opportunities.38 It is 
therefore incumbent upon governments to ensure that 
intervention costs are largely met through fi
 nancial 
protection measures such as health insurance schemes. 
In the many low-income and middle-income settings in 
which rates of service availability and uptake remain 
very low, however, enhanced fi
 nancial protection 
measures alone will not move the population of people 
with MNS disorders substantially towards a goal of 
universal health coverage. For that goal to be 
progressively realised, fi
 nancial coverage of people with 
MNS disorders needs to be accompanied by substantially 
scaled up service coverage.39
How to scale up? Health system barriers and 
opportunities
Despite the evidence summarised in the preceding 
sections, 
most 
low-income 
and 
middle-income 
countries are taking relatively little action to address the 
health care and other needs of people with MNS 
disorders. Perhaps the most important reason for this 
failure to act is the overall poor political commitment to 
MNS disorders, as evident from the fact that less than 
1% of the health budget in most low-income and middle-
income countries is allocated to mental health.40 
Similarly, despite the evidence-based calls to action to 
scale up services for almost a decade,41 less than 1% of 
development assistance for health is devoted to mental 
health care.42 Key reasons for the absence of political will 
and consequently low levels of resource allocation 
include the low demand for mental health-care 
interventions (in part due to low levels of mental health 
literacy and high levels of stigma associated with MNS

belief in the importance of hospital-based specialised 
models of care, which continue to absorb dis-
proportionate amounts of the already meagre budgetary 
allocations for this sector.25 To add to this list is the 
reality that the evidence synthesised in this paper has 
limitations, particularly the substantial gaps in the 
evidence in support of some interventions in low-
income and middle-income countries and limited 
eff
 ectiveness of the best available interventions for some 
disorders. To address this formidable list of barriers, the 
scaling up of interventions for people with MNS 
disorders will require an approach that embraces public 
health 
principles, 
systems 
thinking, 
and 
a 
whole-of-government perspective, as has been shown by 
several countries (panel 2).
Key 
strategies 
necessary 
for 
health-system 
strengthening 
include: 
the 
mainstreaming 
of 
a 
rights-based perspective throughout the health system 
and ensuring health policies, plans, and laws are updated 
to be consistent with international human rights 
standards and conventions; implementation of multi-
component initiatives to address stigma, enhancement 
of mental health literacy and demand for care, and 
mobilisation of people with the disorders to support each

other and be eff
 ective advocates; engagement of other 
key sectors that work to improve services for people with 
MNS disorders, notably the social care, non-governmental 
organisations, private sector, criminal justice, education, 
and indigenous medical sectors, as they may have 
complementary roles; provision of inpatient care in the 
form of general or district hospital units rather than 
stand-alone psychiatric hospitals; the creation of a 
non-specialist cadre for human resources that can be 
case managers and coordinate the delivery of collaborative 
care in primary care and other health-care platforms; 
ensuring the supply of essential medicines at relevant 
platforms; and investment in research across the 
translational continuum (from basic scientifi
 c discoveries 
to eff
 ective clinical applications to interventions for 
improving public health). Financing options could 
include the raising and diversion of income taxes on 
unhealthy products (such as alcohol and tobacco); 
emphasis on the use of low-cost generic drugs throughout 
the health-care system; and reallocation of expenditure 
on ineff
 ective or low-value interventions (such as 
irrational use of benzodiazepines and vitamins in 
primary care). Finally, the embedding of health indicators 
for MNS disorders within national health information 
and surveillance systems will be important so that 
progress and achievements can be monitored and 
assessed.43 The WHO Comprehensive Mental Health 
Action Plan44 off
 ers a clear roadmap for countries at any 
stage of the journey to scale up eff
 orts. Some WHO 
regions (such as the Eastern Mediterranean) have 
adapted this new policy instrument to initiate 
consultations with international experts and regional 
policy makers to develop frameworks for action (panel 3) 
across all four domains of the Plan, along with 
priority interventions and indicators for assessment of 
progress.45
Time to act, now
MNS disorders account for a substantial proportion of 
the global disease burden. This burden has increased 
dramatically since 1990 and is expected to rise in line 
with the epidemiological transition from infectious 
disease to non-communicable disease, with demographic 
transition in low-income and middle-income countries, 
and with the increase in the prevalence of several social 
determinants associated with these disorders. New 
analyses presented here suggest that the mortality-
associated disease burden is very large and previously 
underestimated. We have also summarised evidence of 
several eff
 ective treatment and prevention interventions 
that 
are 
feasible 
to 
implement 
across 
diverse 
socioeconomic and cultural settings for a range of 
priority MNS disorders. A very relevant aspect of these 
disorders is their propensity to strike early in life, which 
is a key factor behind their large contribution to the 
global burden of disease. Although several important 
health-system barriers need to be addressed to scale up 
the recommendations outlined in this paper, country 
case studies (panel 2) show that the most important 
driver of change is political will and commitment in 
countries and development agencies to allocate the 
necessary resources and provide technical leadership.
The analyses presented in this DCP-3 volume will be 
synthesised over the coming months along with the 
fi
 ndings and recommendations of eight other volumes, 
with a view to inform ongoing deliberations around the 
implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals 
and other policy agendas. The evidence from this volume 
alone makes a compelling case to scale up interventions 
to address the avoidable toll of suff
 ering caused by MNS 
disorders, not least among the poorest people and least 
resourced countries in the world. Although our analyses 
have presented the strong public health and economic 
evidence to support this investment, a moral case must 
ultimately be made for the scaling up of health care for 
the hundreds of millions of people whose health-care 
needs have been systematically neglected and whose 
basic human rights routinely denied.46 The time to act on 
this evidence is therefore now.
