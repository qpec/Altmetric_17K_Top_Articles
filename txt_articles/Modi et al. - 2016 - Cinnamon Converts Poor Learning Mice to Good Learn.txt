Abstract
This study underlines the importance of cinnamon, a commonly used natural spice and flavoring 
material, and its metabolite sodium benzoate (NaB) in converting poor learning mice to good 
learning ones. NaB, but not sodium formate, was found to upregulate plasticity-related molecules, 
stimulate NMDA- and AMPA-sensitive calcium influx and increase of spine density in cultured 
hippocampal neurons. NaB induced the activation of CREB in hippocampal neurons via protein 
kinase A (PKA), which was responsible for the upregulation of plasticity-related molecules. 
Finally, spatial memory consolidation-induced activation of CREB and expression of different 
plasticity-related molecules were less in the hippocampus of poor learning mice as compared to 
good learning ones. However, oral treatment of cinnamon and NaB increased spatial memory 
consolidation-induced activation of CREB and expression of plasticity-related molecules in the 
hippocampus of poor-learning mice and converted poor learners into good learners. These results 
describe a novel property of cinnamon in switching poor learners to good learners via stimulating 
hippocampal plasticity.

Introduction
Improvement in memory and learning is of great value in human life. Although some people 
are inborn good learners and some become so in association to appropriate environments, 
some find it hard in learning new tasks. The hippocampal neurons are often associated 
during early memory performance and preservation. During memory impairments, 
hippocampal neurons are often compromised and exhibit down-regulation of many 
functional genes (Colangelo et al., 2002) involved in ion conductance (Myers et al., 1999;

 Jacob et al., 2007), synapse formation (Selkoe, 2002), dendritic arborization (Shim and 
Lubec, 2002), long term potentiation (Clayton et al., 2002; Malenka and Bear, 2004), and 
long term depression (Collingridge et al.; Malenka and Bear, 2004). Impaired calcium influx 
through ionotropic glutamate receptors including NMDA and AMPA receptors is directly 
linked to the loss of hippocampal learning and memory (Olney et al., 1998). Accordingly, 
postmortem analysis of dementia brains shows alteration in NMDA receptor subunits 
including NR1, NR2A, and NR2B in susceptible brain regions including the hippocampus 
(Mishizen-Eberz et al., 2004). Down-regulation of immediate early genes (IEGs) 
(Desjardins et al., 1997; Mishizen-Eberz et al., 2004) including arc, zif-268, homer-1, c-fos 
and inhibition of synapse-associated genes (Proctor et al.; Reddy et al., 2005; Bell et al., 
2008) including psd-95, synpo, adam-10 have also been reported in demented brains. 
Therefore, increasing neuronal plasticity is an important area of research as it may 
eventually help us in improving memory in poor learners and treating different forms of 
dementia.
Here, we have undertaken a simple and natural approach to upregulate hippocampal 
plasticity. Cinnamon is a commonly used natural spice and flavoring material used for 
centuries throughout the world. We have already demonstrated that after oral administration, 
cinnamon is metabolized into sodium benzoate (NaB), a food-additive and an FDA-
approved drug for hyperammonemia, and that the level of NaB increases in different parts of 
the brain after cinnamon intake (Jana et al., 2013; Modi et al., 2015). We have also 
delineated that NaB is anti-inflammatory (Brahmachari et al., 2009), immunomodulatory 
(Brahmachari and Pahan, 2007), neurotrophic (Jana et al., 2013), anti-oxidant (Modi et al., 
2015), and neuroprotective (Jana et al., 2013). Here, we delineate that NaB stimulates 
calcium influx via NMDA- and AMPA-sensitive ionotropic glutamate receptors, increases 
the expression of plasticity related molecules and enhances morphological plasticity in 
hippocampal neurons. NaB stimulates the expression of plasticity-related molecules in 
hippocampal neurons via activation of CREB. Furthermore, we describe that spatial memory 
consolidation-induced activation of CREB and expression of different plasticity related 
molecules are less in the hippocampus of poor-learning mice than good-learning mice. 
However, oral treatment of poor-learning mice with cinnamon and NaB increases memory 
consolidation-induced DNA-binding activity of CREB and the expression of plasticity-
related molecules in the hippocampus and converts poor-learning mice into good-learning 
ones. These results suggest that cinnamon may be used to improve memory and learning in 
poor learners.

 Cell Signaling. Antibodies against tubulin (catalog # Ab6046), Gabra5 (catalog # Ab10098) 
and PSD95 (catalog # Ab2723) were purchased from Abcam. Alexa-fluor antibodies used in 
immunostaining were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch and IR-dye-labeled reagents 
used for immunoblotting were from Li-Cor Biosciences.
Isolation and Maintenance of Mouse Hippocampal neurons
Hippocampal neurons were isolated from fetuses (E18) of pregnant female mice as 
described by us (Jana et al., 2007; Saha et al., 2009). Briefly, dissection and isolation 
procedures were performed in an ice-cold, sucrose buffer solution (sucrose 0.32 M, Tris 
0.025 M; pH 7.4). The skin and the skull were carefully removed from the brain by scissors 
followed by peeling off the meninges by a pair of fine tweezers. A fine incision was made in 
the middle line around the circle of Willis and medial temporal lobe was opened up. 
Hippocampus was isolated as a thin slice of tissue located near the cortical edge of medial 
temporal lobe. Hippocampal tissues isolated from all fetal pups (n >10) were combined 
together and homogenized with 1 ml of Trypsin for 5 min at 37°C followed by neutralization 
of trypsin (Jana et al., 2007; Saha et al., 2009). The single cell suspension of hippocampal 
tissue was plated in the poly-D-lysine pre-coated 75 mm flask. Five minutes after plating, 
the supernatants were carefully removed and replaced with complete neurobasal media. The 
next day, 10 μM AraC was added to remove glial contamination in the neuronal culture. The 
pure cultures of hippocampal neurons were allowed to differentiate fully for 9-10 days 
before treatment.
Measurement of spine density and size
Spine density and size were measured as described before by us (Roy et al., 2014) with 
minor modification. Briefly, E18 hippocampal neurons were stained with Alexa-647 
conjugated phalloidin together with anti-Tuj1 antibody. Only densely stained neurons were 
counted. The total length of each dendrite was measured at 400X magnification using an 
Olympus BX-51 fluorescence microscope. The number of spines on the dendrites was 
counted under oil immersion. As some of the spines were hidden under the dendrite, only 
spines that protruded laterally from the shafts of the dendrites into the surrounding area of 
clear neuropil were counted. The spine density of a pyramidal neuron was calculated by 
dividing the total number of spines on a neuron by the total length of its dendrites, and was 
expressed as the number of spines/10 μm dendrite. The size of the dendritic spines was 
measured by calculating the ratio of mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of the spine head and 
MFI of the dendritic shaft.
Calcium Influx Assay in Primary Mouse Hippocampal Neurons
Calcium influx was monitored in cultured hippocampal neurons as described by us earlier 
(Roy et al., 2013; Roy et al., 2014). Briefly, neurons were loaded with Fluo4-fluorescence 
conjugated calcium buffer (Invitrogen Molecular Probes, Cat# F10471) and incubated at 
37°C for 60 mins following manufacturer’s protocol. After that, fluorescence excitation and 
emission spectra were recorded in a Perkin–Elmer Victor X2 Luminescence Spectrometer in 
the presence of 50 μM NMDA and AMPA solutions. The recording was performed with 300 
repeats at 0.1ms intervals.

 Immunofluorescence analysis
Immunofluorescence analysis was performed as described earlier (Mondal et al.; Roy et al., 
2008). Briefly, cells cultured in 8-well chamber slides (Lab-Tek II) were fixed with 4% 
paraformaldehyde for 20 min followed by treatment with cold ethanol (−20 °C) for 5 min 
and 2 rinses in PBS. Samples were blocked with 3% BSA in PBST for 30 min and incubated 
in PBST containing 1% BSA and rabbit anti-NR2A (1:100), anti-GluR1 (1:100), anti-PSD95 
(1:100) and anti-CREB (1:100). After three washes in PBST (15 min each), slides were 
further incubated with cy2- and cy5-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson 
ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). For negative controls, a set of culture slides was 
incubated under similar conditions without the primary antibodies. The samples were 
mounted and observed under an Olympus IX81 fluorescent microscope. For tissue staining, 
brains kept in 4% paraformaldehyde were sectioned in cryostat machine with 30 μm 
thickness followed by the immunostaining as described before (Ghosh et al., 2007).
Assay of PKA and PKC
Assays for PKA and PKC were purchased from Enzo Life Sciences and performed 
according to manufacturer’s protocol as described (Corbett et al., 2012; Modi et al., 2013). 
Values were normalized to purified kinase controls.
EMSA
DNA-binding activity of CREB was analyzed by non-radioactive electrophoretic mobility 
shift assay (EMSA) as described (Corbett et al., 2012; Ghosh and Pahan, 2012). Briefly, 
nuclear extracts were complexed with a cocktail of binding buffer (Tris-HCl, KCl, EDTA, 
DTT, 10x TGE, glycerol and Triton-X 100), custom designed fluorescent CREB-specific 
probes (Li-Cor Biosciences), and salmon sperm DNA (Invitrogen) for 15 min at room 
temperature and electrophoresed on custom-cast 6% polyacrylamide-TGE gels in 1X TGE 
for 2 hrs. The shift was visualized under the Odyssey® Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor).
Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis
To remove any contaminating genomic DNA, total RNA was digested with DNase. Semi-
quantitative RT-PCR was carried out as described earlier (Corbett et al., 2012; Ghosh and 
Pahan, 2012; Khasnavis et al., 2012) using a RT-PCR kit from Clontech. Briefly, 1 μg of 
total RNA was reverse transcribed using oligo(dT)12-18 as primer and MMLV reverse 
transcriptase (Clontech). The resulting cDNA was appropriately-diluted, and diluted cDNA 
was amplified. Amplified products were electrophoresed on a 1.8% agarose gels and 
visualized by ethidium bromide staining.
Immunoblotting
Western blotting was performed as described earlier (Corbett et al.; Khasnavis and Pahan, 
2012; Jana et al., 2013) with modifications. Briefly, cells were scraped in lysis buffer, 
transferred to microfuge tubes and spun into pellet. The supernatant was collected and 
analyzed for protein concentration via the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). SDS sample buffer 
was added to 30-50 μg total protein and the sample was boiled for 5 min. Denatured samples 
were electrophoresed on NuPAGE® Novex® 4-12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) and proteins

 transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) using the Thermo-Pierce Fast Semi-
Dry Blotter. The membrane was then washed for 15 min in TBS plus Tween 20 (TBST) and 
blocked for 1 h in TBST containing BSA. Next, membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C 
under shaking conditions with primary antibody. The next day, membranes were washed in 
TBST for 1 h, incubated with secondary antibody (Li-Cor Biosciences) for 1 h at room 
temperature, washed for one more hour and visualized under the Odyssey® Infrared 
Imaging System (Li-COR, Lincoln, NE).
Animals and cinnamon/NaB treatment
Male C57/BL6 mice (8-10 week old; purchased from Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) were treated 
with cinnamon (50 mg/kg body wt/d) and NaB (50 mg/kg body wt/d) via gavage for 30 d 
followed by monitoring memory and learning and hippocampal histochemical and 
biochemical assays. NaFO was used as a negative control of NaB. While NaB and NaFO 
were solubilized in water, cinnamon (Cinnamonum verum) powder was mixed in 0.5% 
methylcellulose (MC). Mice were gavaged 100 μL cinnamon-mixed MC and 100 μL NaB- 
and NaFO-mixed water once daily using gavage needle as described (Jana et al., 2013; 
Khasnavis and Pahan, 2014; Mondal and Pahan, 2014; Modi et al., 2015). Another group of 
control mice also received only MC as vehicle.
Barnes Maze
Barnes maze was performed as described by us (Corbett et al., 2013; Roy et al., 2013; Modi 
et al., 2014; Modi et al., 2015). Briefly, for Barnes maze, mice were trained for 2 
consecutive days followed by examination on day 3. During training, the overnight food-
deprived mouse was placed in the middle of the maze in a 10 cm high cylindrical black start 
chamber. After 10 s, the start chamber was removed to allow the mouse to move around the 
maze to find out the color food chips in the baited tunnel. The session was ended when the 
mouse entered the baited tunnel. The tunnel was always located underneath the same hole 
(stable within the spatial environment), which was randomly determined for each mouse. 
After each training session, maze and escape tunnel were thoroughly cleaned with a mild 
detergent to avoid instinctive odor avoidance due to mouse's odor from the familiar object. 
On day 3, the maze was illuminated with high wattage light that generated enough light and 
heat to motivate animals to enter into the escape tunnel (Prut et al., 2007), allowing us to 
measure latency (duration before all four paws were on the floor of the escape box) and 
errors (incorrect responses before all four paws were on the floor of the escape box).
T Maze
T maze experiments were performed as described by us (Roy et al., 2013; Modi et al., 2014; 
Modi et al., 2015). Briefly, mice were habituated in the T-maze for two days under food-
deprived conditions so that animals can eat food rewards at least five times during 10 
minutes period of training. During each trial, mice were placed in the start point for 30 s and 
then forced to make a right arm turn which was always baited with color food chips. On 
entering the right arm, they were allowed to stay there for 30-45 s, then returned to the start 
point, held for 30 s and then allowed to make right turn again. As described above, after each 
training session, T maze was thoroughly cleaned with a mild detergent. On day 3, mice were 
tested for making positive turns and negative turns. The reward side is always associated

 with a visual cue. Number of times the animal eats the food reward would be considered as a 
positive turn.
Statistical Analysis
All values were expressed as means ± SD of three independent experiments. Statistical 
differences between means were calculated by the Student's t-test. A p- value of less than 
0.05 (p<0.05) was considered statistically significant. Differences in behavioral measures 
were examined by independent one-way ANOVA using SPSS. Homogeneity of variance 
between test groups was examined using Levene's test. Post-hoc analyses were conducted 
using Tukey’s or Games-Howell tests, where appropriate. p < 0.05 was considered 
statistically significant.
Results
NaB stimulated the expression of plasticity-related molecules in hippocampal neurons
To understand the effect of cinnamon metabolite NaB on plasticity, we examined the 
expression of different plasticity-related molecules in NaB-treated hippocampal neurons. 
NMDA receptor subunit NR-2A, AMPA-receptor subunit GluR1 and PSD-95, a membrane-
associated guanylate kinase and a potent regulator of synaptic strength, are some of the 
major plasticity-related molecules in the hippocampus. NaB treatment stimulated the 
expression of NR2A, GluR1 and PSD95 proteins in hippocampal neurons (Fig. 1A-B). This 
result was specific as sodium formate (NaFO) having similar chemical structure as NaB 
except the benzene ring had no such stimulatory effect (Fig. 1A-B). Moreover, in contrast to 
the stimulation of plasticity-related molecules, NaB was unable to stimulate the expression 
of GABRA5, receptor subunit of γ amino butyric acid and a molecule that is involved in 
long-term depression (Atack, 2010), in hippocampal neurons (Fig. 1A-B). Dose-dependent 
studies showed that NaB was capable of upregulating the expression of NR2A, GluR1 and 
PSD95 at a dose of 50 μM and the maximum increase was found at either 100 or 200 μM 
(Fig. 1C-D). Again, NaB did not increase the expression of GABRA5 at any of the doses 
tested (Fig. 1C-D). We corroborated our Western blot results with immunofluorescence 
analysis of NR2A, GluR1 and PSD95 in hippocampal neurons. Double-label 
immunofluorescence of NR2A (Fig. 1E), GluR1 (Fig. 1F) and PSD95 (Fig. 1G) with Tuj1 
showed that NaB strongly upregulated these proteins in the projections of hippocampal 
neurons.
NaB induced morphological plasticity in cultured hippocampal neurons
Since the formation and maturation of dendritic spines contribute directly to the long-term 
enhancement of synaptic efficacy of hippocampal neurons involved in learning and memory, 
we studied the effect of NaB on the number, size, and maturation of dendritic spines. 
Fluorescently tagged phalloidin was used to label filamentous actin in cell bodies and axons 
and throughout the dendrites. Interestingly, NaB, but not NaFO, increased the density of 
dendritic spines in cultured hippocampal neurons (Fig. 2A). Detailed morphological 
analyses further revealed that NaB, but not NaFO, stimulated the number (Fig. 2B) and size 
(Fig. 2C) of dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, NaB, but not NaFO, 
increased the maturation of dendritic spines (Fig. 2D) and NaB-treated hippocampal neurons

 exhibited greater number of mushroom (Fig. 2E) and stubby (Fig. 2F) spines than either 
untreated or NaFO-treated neurons. These results suggest that NaB enhances the synaptic 
maturation of hippocampal neurons by enriching the density and size of dendritic spines.
NaB stimulated inward calcium current in cultured hippocampal neurons
Since an increase in the number of matured spines directly regulates synaptic transmission in 
the post-synaptic neurons via NMDA- and AMPA-regulated ionotropic receptors, our next 
aim was to study calcium influx through NMDA and AMPA receptors after NaB treatment. 
Interestingly, we observed that NaB, but not NaFO, stimulated calcium influx in the 
presence of NMDA (Fig. 3A) or AMPA (Fig. 3B), suggesting that NaB potentiates 
postsynaptic membrane depolarization, eventually leading to the long term enhancement of 
synaptic activity in hippocampal neurons.
NaB requires CREB for the upregulation of NR2A in hippocampal neurons
Next, we investigated mechanisms by which NaB upregulated the expression of plasticity-
related molecules in hippocampal neurons. Upon analysis of the promoter of nr2a gene, one 
of important plasticity-related genes, by using MatInspector, we found that mouse nr2a 
promoter harbors several consensus cAMP response element (CRE). Therefore, we were 
prompted to investigate if NaB required CREB for the upregulation of NR2A in mouse 
hippocampal neurons. First, we examined if NaB alone was capable of inducing the 
activation of CREB in hippocampal neurons. Activation of CREB was monitored by levels 
of phosphorylated CREB (p-CREB). NaB alone induced the phosphorylation of CREB as 
depicted by Western blot (Fig. 4A-B). NaB-induced phosphorylation of CREB was evident 
as early as 5 min of stimulation (Fig. 4A-B). On the other hand, we did not see any change 
in the level of total CREB upon NaB stimulation (Fig. 4A). Next, we investigated if NaB 
required CREB for the upregulation of NR2A in hippocampal neurons. We employed the 
siRNA approach to study the involvement of CREB. As evident from figure 4C-D, CREB 
siRNA, but not control siRNA, decreased the expression of CREB protein in NaB-treated 
neurons. Accordingly, CREB siRNA, but not control siRNA, abrogated NaB-mediated 
increase in NR2A protein (Fig. 4E-F). These results suggest that CREB is required for NaB-
mediated upregulation of NR2A in hippocampal neurons.
NaB increased the activation of CREB and the expression of NR2A in hippocampal 
neurons via protein kinase A (PKA)
Next, we decided to elucidate mechanisms by which NaB induced the activation of CREB 
and increased the expression of NR2A in hippocampal neurons. Because kinases like protein 
kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) play an important role in the activation of 
CREB, we examined the role of PKA and PKC in NaB-mediated upregulation of NR2A. At 
first, we monitored if NaB alone was capable of activating PKA and PKC in mouse 
hippocampal neurons. As evident from figure 4G, NaB alone induced the activation of PKA 
in hippocampal neurons in a time-dependent manner and this activation was significant as 
early as 15 min of stimulation. In contrast, NaB remained unable to induce the activation of 
PKC at different time points tested (Fig. 4H), ruling out the involvement of PKC in these 
processes. Therefore, next, we examined if NaB required PKA for the activation of CREB. 
Suppression of NaB-mediated phosphorylation of CREB (Fig. 4I-J) by H-89, a specific

 inhibitor of PKA, suggests that NaB induces the activation of CREB in hippocampal 
neurons via PKA. Consistent to the involvement of CREB in NaB-mediated upregulation of 
NR2A, H-89 also inhibited NaB-mediated expression of NR2A in hippocampal neurons 
(Fig. 4K-L). These results suggest that NaB requires PKA for the activation of CREB and 
the expression of NR2A in hippocampal neurons.
Reduced activation of CREB and decreased levels of plasticity-related molecules in the 
hippocampus of poor learners as compared to good learners
The hippocampus regulates the generation of long term memory and spatial learning (Morris 
et al., 1986; Roy et al., 2013; Roy and Pahan, 2015). Therefore, we investigated the levels of 
CREB activation of plasticity-related molecules in the hippocampus of poor learners and 
good learners. Based on spatial memory consolidation (Roy et al., 2013) on Barnes circular 
maze (Fig. 5A), male C57/BL6 mice (6-8 week old) were separated into good and poor 
performers. Good performing mice exhibited significantly greater memory performance on 
Barnes maze than poor performing mice as shown by track plot (Fig. 5B), latency (Fig. 5C) 
and number of errors (Fig. 5D). There was significant difference of t46=4.852; p <0.001 
observed with mean difference of 66.22 between good and poor learners as calculated by 
unpaired t-test. Since CREB is regarded as an important regulator memory and learning, we 
examined the activation of CREB in the hippocampus of good and poor learning mice 24 h 
post trial (Fig. 5A) by EMSA. Interestingly, the level of CREB activation was much higher 
in the hippocampus of good learning mice than poor learning mice (Fig. 5E). These results 
suggest that memory consolidation-induced activation of CREB in the hippocampus is much 
higher in good learning mice than poor learning ones. Therefore, we further analyzed the 
expression of different plasticity-related molecules that depend on CREB activation. 
Consistent to CREB activation, we also found that the levels of NR2A (Fig. 5F & G), GluR1 
(Fig. 5F & H) and PSD95 (Fig. 5F & I) were much less in the hippocampus of poor learning 
mice than good learning mice. Together, these results suggest that spatial memory 
consolidation-induced activation of CREB and expression of plasticity-related molecules in 
the hippocampus are much higher in good learning mice than poor learning ones.
Oral administration of cinnamon and NaB increases spatial memory consolidation-
mediated expression of plasticity-related molecules in the hippocampus of poor learning 
mice
Since NaB induced the activation of CREB and upregulated the expression of plasticity-
related molecules in hippocampal neurons, we examined if NaB and cinnamon itself could 
upregulate memory consolidation-induced expression of plasticity-related molecules in the 
hippocampus of poor learning mice. Poor learning mice were treated with NaB and 
cinnamon orally for a month followed by Barnes maze training and test (Fig. 5A). Twenty-
four h after the test, the activation of CREB and the expression of different plasticity-related 
molecules were monitored in the hippocampus. Untreated poor and good learning mice as 
well as vehicle-treated poor learning mice were also run in parallel. As evident from CREB 
EMSA in Figure 6A, oral administration of cinnamon and NaB, but not vehicle, increased 
memory consolidation-induced DNA-binding activity of CREB in vivo in the hippocampus 
of poor learning mice. Accordingly, memory consolidation-induced expression of neuronal 
activity-regulated genes (Egr1, Fos, Bdnf, Homer1, Arc, Snk, & Spar) (Fig. 6B-C), synaptic

 formation-related genes (Synapsin, Prosap2, Nrxn1, Nrxn3, Agrin, & CamKiia) (Fig. 6D-E) 
and synaptic plasticity-associated genes (Glur1, Glur4, Nr2a, & Nr2b) (Fig. 6F-G) was 
lower in the hippocampus of poor learning mice than good learning ones. However, oral 
treatment of poor learning mice with cinnamon and NaB significantly increased the 
expression of neuronal activity-regulated genes (Fig. 6B-C), synaptic formation-related 
genes (Fig. 6D-E) and synaptic plasticity-associated genes (Fig. 6F-G) in vivo in the 
hippocampus. To further confirm these results, we performed Western blot of hippocampal 
extracts for some of these plasticity-related molecules. Consistent to mRNA expression, 
cinnamon and NaB, but not vehicle, augmented memory consolidation-induced expression 
of NR2A, GluR1 and PSD95 in the hippocampus of poor learning mice (Fig. 6H-K). 
Cinnamon and NaB were capable of enhancing the DNA-binding activity of CREB (Fig. 
6A) and the expression of different plasticity-related genes (Fig. 6B-G) and proteins (Fig. 
6H-K) in the hippocampus of poor learning mice to a level very similar to that found in good 
learning mice.
Oral administration of cinnamon and NaB improves spatial learning and memory in poor 
learning mice
Since cinnamon and NaB treatment increases memory consolidation-induced activation of 
CREB and the expression of different plasticity-related molecules in the hippocampus of 
poor learning mice, we analyzed spatial learning and memory of poor learners after 
cinnamon and NaB treatment. First, we analyzed the performance in Barnes maze. As 
expected, poor learning mice exhibited more latency and greater number of errors than good 
learners (Fig. 7A-C). However, after cinnamon and NaB treatment, poor learning mice 
exhibited significantly improved memory performance on Barnes maze as shown by track 
plot (Fig. 7A), latency [F5,42 =17.598, p<0.001(=0.00002)] (Fig. 7B) and number of errors 
[F5,42=10.570, p<0.05(=0.000012)] (Fig. 7C) as compared to vehicle-treated poor learning 
mice, confirmed by one way ANOVA test. Post hoc tests of multiple comparisons using 
Tukey HSD analyses showed that poor learning mice took longer time to find the reward 
hole and exhibited more latency p<0.01(=0.00018) and greater number of errors 
p<0.05(=0.038) in the Barnes maze as compared to good learning mice. However, 
cinnamon-treated poor learning mice were as capable as good learning mice in finding the 
target hole (Fig. 7A-C) and exhibited significantly less latency p<0.001(=0.001) and fewer 
errors p<0.05(=0.006). Similarly, NaB-treated poor learning mice were also effective in 
finding the target hole (Fig. 7A-C) with reduced latency (p=0.01) and fewer errors 
p<0.01(=0.0001). We also treated a group of good learning mice with cinnamon for a month 
to see if there were any further improvements in Barnes maze performance. However, as 
compared to untreated good learning mice, we did not find any significant improvement in 
latency and errors in cinnamon-fed good learning mice (Fig. 7A-C).
Next, we performed T maze to determine whether cinnamon and NaB could improve spatial 
memory in poor learning mice. Untreated poor performing mice exhibited less number of 
positive turns p<0.05(=0.014) and greater number of negative turns p<0.001(=0.004) than 
age-matched untreated good performing mice in T maze apparatus (Fig. 7D-E). However, 
cinnamon-treatment significantly improved hippocampus dependent memory performances 
as cinnamon-fed poor learning mice exhibited more positive turns p<0.05(=0.0041) and less

 negative turns p<0.01(=0.00012) compared to vehicle-fed poor learning mice in T maze 
(Fig. 7D-E). In contrast, cinnamon treatment did not further improve T maze functions of 
good learning mice as compared to untreated good learning ones (Fig. 7D-E). Similar to 
cinnamon treatment, NaB-treated poor learning mice also exhibited greater number of 
positive turns p<0.05(=0.0011) and reduced number of negative turns p<0.01(=0.00031) as 
compared to vehicle-fed poor learning mice.
We also monitored if orally administered cinnamon or NaB had any effect on general 
locomotor activities in these mice. In fact, after open field test analyses, we did not observe 
any significant alteration in total distance travel (Fig. 7F), moving speed (Fig. 7G) and 
stereotypy (Fig. 7H) in poor learning mice, suggesting that cinnamon or NaB treatment does 
not modulate gross motor activities in these mice.
Discussion
Individual difference in educational performance is a global issue. For example, between 
two students of the same background studying in the same class, in most cases, one does 
better than the other academically, suggesting that inter-individual differences can have 
striking output in performance and achievement. While such inter-individual differences are 
strongly related to differences in intelligence and memory, relatively little is known on how 
to improve performance in poor performers. Therefore, exploring ways to boost plasticity 
and improve memory and learning is an important area of research as it may help switching 
poor learners to good learners and preventing age-related decline in memory. The 
hippocampus, a small organ located within the brain's medial temporal lobe, participates in 
generating, organizing and storing memory. Although there are other approaches for 
improving hippocampal function, here we introduce a widely-used natural product to 
augment hippocampal plasticity. Cinnamon, the brown bark of cinnamon tree, is a 
commonly used spice and flavoring material for deserts, candies, chocolate, etc. It has a long 
history as a medicine as well. Medieval physicians used cinnamon in medicines to treat a 
variety of disorders including arthritis, coughing, hoarseness, sore throats, etc. In addition to 
containing manganese, dietary fiber, iron, and calcium, cinnamon contains a major 
compound, cinnamaldehyde, which is converted into cinnamic acid by oxidation. In the 
liver, this cinnamic acid is β-oxidized to benzoate (Abd El-Mawla et al., 2001) that exists as 
sodium salt (NaB) or benzoyl-CoA. It has been reported that minor amount of NaB is also 
excreted in the urine of human (Bridges et al., 1970; Kubota and Ishizaki, 1991). NaB is of 
medical importance as it is a component of Ucephan, a FDA-approved drug used in the 
treatment for hepatic metabolic defects associated with hyperammonemia such as urea cycle 
disorder in children (Leonard and Morris, 2002; Scaglia et al., 2004). It is also widely used 
as a preservative in broad range of foods and cosmetic products (Nair, 2001). We have seen 
that cinnamon and NaB modify T cells and protect mice from experimental allergic 
encephalomyelitis, an animal model of multiple sclerosis (Brahmachari and Pahan, 2007; 
Mondal and Pahan, 2015; Pahan, 2015). Cinnamon and NaB also upregulate neuroprotective 
molecules (Parkin and DJ-1) and protect dopaminergic neurons in MPTP mouse model of 
Parkinson’s disease (Khasnavis and Pahan, 2012, 2014). Recently, we have seen that 
cinnamon and NaB attenuate the activation of p21ras, reduce the formation of reactive 
oxygen species and protect memory and learning in 5XFAD model of AD (Modi et al., 
Modi et al.

 2015). Here we delineate that NaB is also capable of improving plasticity in cultured 
hippocampal neurons. Our conclusion is based on the following: First, NaB upregulated the 
expression of a number of plasticity-associated molecules (NR2A, GluR1, Arc, and PSD95) 
in hippocampal neurons. Second, Gabra5 is known to support long-term depression (Isaac, 
2001). It is interesting to see that NaB did not stimulate the expression of Gabra5 in 
hippocampal neurons. Third, NaB increased the number, size and maturation of dendritic 
spines in cultured hippocampal neurons, suggesting a beneficial role of NaB in regulating 
the synaptic efficacy of neurons. Fourth, we observed that NaB did not alter the calcium 
dependent excitability of hippocampal neurons, but rather stimulated inbound calcium 
currents in these neurons through ionotropic glutamate receptor. Together, these results 
clearly demonstrate that NaB is capable of increasing neuronal plasticity.
The signaling events required for the transcription of plasticity-related genes are becoming 
clear. Upon analysis of the NR2A promoter using the Genomatix Software Suite, we have 
found multiple binding sites for CREB and at least one consensus binding site for NF-κB, C/
EBPβ and AP-1 in the NR2A promoter. Although these transcription factors (CREB, NF-
κB, C/EBPβ, and AP-1) may play a role in the expression of various plasticity-associated 
genes, activation of CREB seems essential for the transcription of these molecules (Impey 
and Goodman, 2001; Roy and Pahan, 2015). Therefore, for a drug to stimulate plasticity, it is 
almost mandatory to stimulate the activation of CREB. Activation of CREB in cultured 
hippocampal neurons by NaB and abrogation of the ability of NaB to induce NR2A by 
siRNA knockdown of CREB suggest that NaB increases the levels of NR2A via CREB. 
However, it was unknown by which mechanisms NaB induced the activation of CREB in 
hippocampal neurons. The cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) pathway, one of the most 
common and versatile signal pathways in eukaryotic cells, is involved in the regulation of 
multiple cellular functions including cell growth, differentiation, survival, and synaptic 
plasticity (Waltereit and Weller, 2003). Here we present evidence that NaB induced the 
activation of CREB via PKA. Although both PKA and PKC are known to phosphorylate and 
activate CREB, NaB specifically induced the activation of PKA, but not PKC. Accordingly, 
suppression of PKA by H-89 inhibited NaB-induced activation of CREB and expression of 
NR2A in hippocampal neurons.
While many molecules show plasticity-stimulating effect in cell culture models, very few 
exhibit efficacy in vivo in the brain. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of NaB and cinnamon 
itself in poor learning mice identified based on performance during spatial memory 
consolidation on Barnes maze. Interestingly, level of CREB activation and status of 
plasticity-related molecules were much less in the hippocampus of poor-performed mice 
than good-performed mice during memory consolidation, suggesting that memory 
consolidation induces the activation of CREB and increases the expression of plasticity-
related genes in the hippocampus of good learning mice. Recently we have delineated that 
oral administration of cinnamon increases the level of NaB in vivo in the nigra (Jana et al., 
2013) and hippocampus (Modi et al., 2015) of mice, suggesting that NaB produced from the 
metabolism of cinnamon is capable of entering into the CNS. In this case, oral 
administration of NaB and cinnamon increased the activation of CREB and CREB-
associated plasticity-related molecules in the hippocampus of poor learning mice. 
Interestingly, hippocampus of poor learning mice expressed greater level of Gabra5 as 
Modi et al.

 compared to good learning mice and treatment of poor learning mice with NaB and 
cinnamon decreased hippocampal Gabra5 to a level that is found in good learning mice. 
These results suggest that increased Gabra5 in vivo in the hippocampus may be linked to 
poor learning. Finally, cinnamon and NaB treatment also improved spatial learning and 
memory in poor learning mice to a level that is seen in good learning mice. We did not 
notice any side effect (e.g. hair loss, weight loss, untoward infection etc.) in any of the mice 
used during the course of the treatment with either cinnamon or NaB. Moreover, there are 
several advantages of NaB and cinnamon over other proposed plasticity-boosting therapies 
as both NaB and cinnamon are fairly nontoxic and cinnamon has been widely used as 
flavoring material and spice throughout the world for centuries. These results suggest that 
NaB and cinnamon should not cause health problems and that these compounds may have 
prospects in boosting plasticity in poor learners and in dementia patients.
In summary, we have demonstrated that cinnamon metabolite NaB upregulates plasticity-
associated molecules and calcium influx in cultured hippocampal neurons via activation of 
CREB. While spatial memory consolidation-induced activation of CREB and expression of 
plasticity-related molecules were less in the hippocampus of poor learning mice as 
compared to good learning ones, oral administration of cinnamon and NaB increased 
memory consolidation-induced activation of CREB and expression of plasticity-related 
molecules in vivo in the hippocampus of poor learning mice and improved their memory and 
learning almost to the level that observed in untreated good learning ones. These results 
highlight a novel plasticity-boosting property of cinnamon and its metabolite NaB and 
suggest that this widely-used spice and/or NaB may be explored for stimulating synaptic 
plasticity and performance in poor learners.

 Fig. 5. Status of CREB activation and plasticity-related molecules in the hippocampus of good 
and poor learning mice
A) Schematic representing the Barnes maze procedure employed for the selection of good-
performed and poor-performed 6-8 week old male C57/BL6 mice. B) Training elucidates 
two behaviorally distinct groups of mice. Representative track plots of good- performed 
(green) and poor-performed (red) mice. Latency (C) and number of errors (D) throughout 
the trial were quantified for good-performed (green; n=6) and poor-performed (red; n=6) 
mice. Results are mean + SEM of six mice per group. ap<0.001 vs. poor-performed. DNA- 
binding activity of CREB was monitored by EMSA in nuclear extracts of hippocampal 
tissues isolated from poor-performed and good-performed mice (E). Results represent 
analysis of four mice per group. Levels of NR2A, GluR1 and PSD95 were monitored in 
hippocampal tissues of poor-performed and good-performed mice by Western blot (F). 
Bands were scanned and values of NR2A/Tubulin (G), GluR1/Tubulin (H) and PSD95/
Tubulin (I) were presented as relative to poor-performed mice. Results are mean ± SEM of 
four mice per group. ap<0.001 vs. poor- performed.

 Fig. 6. Oral administration of cinnamon and NaB upregulates the activation of CREB and 
stimulates the expression plasticity-associated molecules in the hippocampus of poor learning 
mice
Poor-performed mice were treated with cinnamon (50 mg/kg body wt/d) and NaB (50 mg/kg 
body wt/d) via gavage. A group of poor-performed mice also received 100 μl 0.5% 
methylcellulose as vehicle. After 30 d of treatment, mice were trained and tested on Barnes 
maze as described in Figure 5A. Twenty-four h after the test, the DNA-binding activity of 
CREB was monitored in hippocampal nuclear extracts by EMSA (A). Results represent 
analysis of four mice per group. The mRNA expression of neuronal activity-related 
molecules (Egr1, Fos, Bdnf, Homer1, Arc, Snk, & Spar) (B & C), synaptic formation-
associated genes (Synapsin, ProSap2, Nrxn1, Nrxn3, Agrin, & CamkIIa) (D & E) and 
synaptic plasticity-related genes (Glur1, Glur4, Nr2a, & Nr2b) (F & G) was examined in the 
hippocampus by RT-PCR. The protein levels of NR2A, PSD95, GluR1, & Gabra5 was also 
monitored in the hippocampus by Western blot (H&I, cinnamon; J&K, NaB). Results are 
mean + SEM of four mice per group. ap<0.001 vs. good- performed; bp<0.001 vs. poor-
performed.

 Fig. 7. Oral administration of cinnamon and NaB improves memory and learning in poor 
learning mice
Poor-performed mice were treated with cinnamon (50 mg/kg body wt/d) and NaB (50 mg/kg 
body wt/d) via gavage. As control, one group of poor-performed mice received 100 μl 0.5% 
methylcellulose as vehicle. For comparison, one group of good-performed mice also 
received cinnamon. After 30 d of treatment, mice were tested for Barnes maze (A, track plot; 
B, latency; C, number of errors), T maze (D, positive turns; E, negative turns) and general 
locomotor activities (F, distance travelled; G, speed; H, stereotypy). Eight mice (n=8) were 
used in each group. Results are mean + SEM of eight mice per group. ap<0.001 vs. good-
performed; bp<0.01 vs. poor-performed.
