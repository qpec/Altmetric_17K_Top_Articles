Abstract
Activated protein C (APC) is a blood protease with anticoagulant activity and cell-signaling 
activities mediated by activation of protease-activated receptors 1 and 3 (PAR1, PAR3) via non-
canonical cleavage1. Recombinant APC and/or its analogs with reduced (>90%) anticoagulant 
activity such as 3K3A-APC (Lys191–193Ala), engineered to reduce APC-associated bleeding risk 
while retaining normal cell signaling activity, have shown benefits in preclinical models of 
ischemic stroke2–6, brain trauma7, multiple sclerosis8, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis9, sepsis10,11, 
ischemic/reperfusion injury of heart12, kidney and liver13, pulmonary, kidney and gastrointestinal

 inflammation1,11, diabetes14 and lethal body radiation15. Based on proof of concept studies and an 
excellent safety profile in humans, 3K3A-APC has advanced to clinical trials as a neuroprotectant 
in ischemic stroke16,17. Recently, 3K3A-APC has been shown to stimulate neuronal production by 
human neural stem/progenitor cells (NSCs) in vitro18 via a PAR1-PAR3-sphingosine-1-phosphate 
receptor 1-Akt pathway19, suggesting the potential for APC-based treatment as a strategy for 
structural repair in the human central nervous system. Here, we report that late post-ischemic 
treatment of mice with 3K3A-APC stimulates neuronal production by transplanted human NSCs, 
promotes circuit restoration, and improves functional recovery. Thus, 3K3A-APC-potentiated 
neuronal recruitment from engrafted NSCs may offer a new approach to the treatment of stroke 
and related neurological disorders.
To determine if 3K3A-APC combined with NSC delivery might be developed as an effective 
combination therapy for neuronal replacement and circuit repair after stroke20, we studied 
the effects of late post-ischemic 3K3A-APC treatment on the in vivo production of neurons 
from transplanted NSCs18,21, and the effects of this combination therapy on long-term 
neurological recovery and restoration of disrupted neural circuitry in the post-ischemic 
murine brain. To investigate these processes in mice, we employed the permanent distal 
middle artery occlusion (dMCAo) model in 8-week old male mice. In contrast to transient 
occlusion models, this approach produces a highly reproducible, well defined infract lesion 
in the neocortex5,6 without the confounding effects of reperfusion. As many stroke patients 
do not receive thrombolytic tissue-plasminogen activator therapy or arterial thrombectomy 
for reperfusion after stroke, the Stroke Treatment Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) 
recommends using permanent ischemia models for the development of new therapies for 
ischemic stroke22.
Human fetal NSCs transduced with a lentivirus carrying a CMV-GFP-T2A-Luciferase 
cassette (1 × 105 cells) were grafted along the cortical infarct border 7 d after permanent 
dMCAo in mice6 (Supplementary Figure 1). Cells were transplanted 7 d after dMCAo 
because previous work has shown that the acute release of products of tissue damage and 
death typically subsides within 7 d of dMCAo, providing potentially less hostile graft 
environment23. Additionally, the infarct lesion size is relatively stable 7 d after dMCAo, 
allowing reproducible transplantation of stem cells in the peri-infarct area23. This was 
followed by intravenous treatment with human recombinant 3K3A-APC (0.2 mg/kg 
intravenously) or vehicle at 7, 9, 11 and 13 d after stroke, and a daily immunosuppressive 
treatment with cyclosporine (Fig. 1a). Transplanted NSCs were longitudinally tracked in 
vivo by noninvasive bioluminescence imaging (BLI) of the endogenous luciferase signal 
(Supplemental Figure 2). BLI showed a progressive decline in luciferase signal in vehicle-
treated mice from 100% to 36% within 4 weeks of transplantation, consistent with the 
reported dying of grafted cells20 (Fig. 1b, c). In contrast, mice treated with 3K3A-APC 
showed a time-dependent increase in luciferase signal, with an average of 1.9 and 5.3-fold 
greater BLI values compared to vehicle at 2 and 5 weeks after stroke, respectively (Fig. 1b, 
c). These data suggest that 3K3A-APC promotes survival and proliferation of grafted NSCs, 
consistent with its mitogenic and anti-apoptotic effects1 previously demonstrated in cultured 
human NSCs in vitro19. Similarly, 3K3A-APC supported survival of engrafted NSCs in non-
ischemic control mice (Supplemental Figure 3). We also quantified cortical width 5 weeks

 after stroke, which is a measure of cerebral cortical expansion or hyperplasia24–27. Mice 
treated with NSCs and 3K3A-APC exhibited a significantly higher cortical width index 
compared to those treated with NSCs and vehicle, 3K3A-APC alone, or vehicle alone (Fig. 
1d, e), These mice also showed significant improvements in motor and sensorimotor 
functions on rotarod and adhesive removal tests, respectively, at 4 and 5 weeks after stroke 
(Fig. 1f, g). Altogether, these findings suggest a significant post-ischemic repair potential of 
late NSCs and 3K3A-APC combination therapy.
We next performed double immunostaining for Tuj1 (a neuronal marker19) and SC121+ (a 
human-specific antigen which detects grafted cells) 5 weeks after stroke and found a 16-fold 
higher number of Tuj1+ SC121+ co-labeled neuronal-like cells in NSCs and 3K3A-APC-
treated mice compared to NSCs and vehicle (Fig. 2a–c). Consistent with previous in vitro19 
findings, the differentiation of NSCs into astroglial-like cells was inhibited by 3K3A-APC, 
evidenced by the lower percentage of SC121+ cells positive for astrocytic glial fibrillary 
acidic protein19 in 3K3A-APC-treated mice compared to vehicle (Supplemental Figure 4). 
Although the survival of transplanted human embryonic kidney 293 cells was also greater in 
3K3A-APC-treated mice, this did not lead to neuronal production (Supplementary figure 5a) 
or improved functional outcomes (Supplementary Figure 5b–c). These findings suggest that 
functional recovery after NSCs and 3K3A-APC treatment is causally associated with 3K3A-
APC-mediated neuronal production from grafted NSCs in vivo. To test this notion directly 
we administered diphtheria toxin (DT)28 5 weeks after stroke to ablate all grafted NSCs, 
which resulted in the complete loss of SC121+ and Tuj1+ SC121+ double positive cells in 
NSCs and 3K3A-APC-treated mice (Fig. 2d–f). Furthermore, DT-mediated NSC ablation 
abolished the beneficial effects of 3K3A-APC on post-ischemic neurological recovery (Fig. 
2g–h) and cortical expansion (Fig. 2i). These data suggest that transplanted NSCs directly 
contributed to functional recovery20,28 after 3K3A-APC treatment.
Next, we utilized anterograde labeling with adeno-associated viruses (AAV2/9.TurboRFP) to 
trace axonal projections from the primary motor cortex M1 (a major source of intracortical 
input to primary somatosensory cortex S1) to the S1 region that is typically damaged by 
dMCAo (Supplemental Figure 6; see Methods). In contrast to the scarcity of axonal 
projections found in mice treated with NSCs and vehicle, we observed substantial 
TurboRFP+ M1 axonal projections to stroke-damaged S1 in NSCs and 3K3A-APC-treated 
mice. These M1 axons were intermingled with engrafted human SC121+ cells (Fig. 3a) and 
were closely juxtaposed to NSCs-derived Tuj1+ neuronal-like cells (Fig. 3b–c). Quantitative 
analysis revealed a 9-fold higher amount of these putative contacts.in NSCs and 3K3A-
APC-treated mice compared to vehicle (Fig. 3d). Staining for synaptic markers 
demonstrated a higher number of co-localized pre-synaptic (synaptophysin) and post-
synaptic (PSD-95) puncta on the engrafted SC121+ NSCs in 3K3A-APC-treated mice 
compared to vehicle (Fig. 3e–f), suggesting the formation of synapses between host neurons 
and NSC-derived neurons. To examine the degree of functional circuitry present in stroke-
affected S1, we performed in vivo voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) imaging of cortical 
membrane potentials 5 weeks after dMCAo in the forelimb S1 region evoked by mechanical 
stimulation of the contralateral forelimb (Fig. 3g). We observed stronger evoked transient 
depolarizations in NSCs and 3K3A-APC-treated mice (Fig. 3h), evidenced by a larger peak 
VSD response amplitude and shorter time to peak response compared to either NSCs and

 vehicle-treated mice or dMCAo-alone mice (Fig. 3i–j, Supplemental Figure 7). NSCs and 
3K3A-APC treatment yielded a complete rescue of time to peak response, while peak 
response amplitudes were rescued to 56% of that observed in sham-operated controls.
To better assess the functional integration of NSCs into the host neuronal circuitry, we stably 
transduced NSCs with a lentivirus carrying the intracellular calcium indicator GCaMP3 
(CAG-GCaMP3-Puro-WPRE29; Supplementary Figure 8a–b, see Methods), and 
transplanted GCaMP3-expressing NSCs (1×105 cells) along the cortical infarct border 7 d 
after dMCAo. This was followed by 3K3A-APC (0.2 mg/kg) or vehicle treatment at 7, 9, 11 
and 13 d after stroke. We then imaged the evoked GCaMP3 signal through a cranial window 
preparation overlying the affected S1 region in response to contralateral forelimb mechanical 
stimulation 5 weeks after stroke (Supplementary Figure 8c). We found that transplanted 
GCaMP3-NSCs in the primary sensory S1 cortex responded to forelimb stimulation with an 
increase in transcranial GFP fluorescence within 1 s (Figure 4a–b), exhibiting a profile 
comparable to that previously reported for the mesoscale transcranial neuronal activity 
mapping with GCaMP330. Mice treated with NSCs and 3K3A-APC showed 3-fold greater 
average peak amplitude compared to vehicle (Figure 4a–c). In addition, deep multi-photon 
laser-scanning microscopy indicated that individual GCaMP3-NSCs in the S1 cortical layers 
II-III responded to forelimb sensory stimulation (Supplementary Figure 8d), and their 
response profiles (Supplementary Figure 8e) resembled the typical profiles of GCaMP3-
based responses from mature mouse cortical neurons31; these differ from astrocytic 
responses that usually last > 10 s32. NSCs and 3K3A-APC-treated mice exhibited a 6-fold 
greater percentage of GCaMP3-positive NSCs that responded to sensory stimulation 
compared to vehicle (Figure 4d), which correlated with a greater than 5-fold increase in the 
percentage of GCaMP3-positive cells expressing the neuronal markers MAP2 or Tuj1 in 
3K3A-APC-treated mice compared to vehicle (Figure 4e–f). These data provide a strong 
support for the improved functional integration of grafted NSCs into the host neuronal 
circuitry as a result of 3K3A-APC-treatment.
FACS analysis of mouse brains after the GCaMP3 imaging experiments, using the GFP 
signal for gating of GCaMP3-positive cells (Supplementary Fig. 9a) and human CD31 as a 
marker for NSC-derived endothelial cells, indicated that < 1% of GCaMP3-NSCs expressed 
human endothelial CD31 five weeks after stroke (Supplementary Figure 9b), which was also 
corroborated by negative human-specific CD31 endothelial immunoreactivity 
(Supplementary Figure 9c). As suggested by previous reports demonstrating the angiogenic 
activity of APC4 and the secretion of angiogenic growth factors by NSCs33, both 3K3A-
APC and NSCs separately promoted murine-derived neovascularization, as shown by 30–
40% and 25–30% increases in murine CD31-positive microvascular profiles and lectin-
positive perfused microvascular length after in vivo lectin angiography4, respectively 
(Supplementary Figure 9d–f). However, NSC and 3K3A-APC combination treatments did 
not have an additive effect on murine neovascularization or cerebral perfusion 
(Supplementary Figure 9d–f). In contrast, combined 3K3A-APC and NSC treatment led to 
significant functional improvements compared to 3K3A-APC alone or NSC treatment alone 
that had no significant effects (Fig. 1f–g). Moreover, ablation of NSCs with diphtheria toxin 
(Fig. 2d–h) suggests that functional improvements of 3K3A-APC and NSCs combination 
therapy depends exclusively on the existence of transplanted NSCs, but not on indirect

 contribution from the host endogenous cells (not affected by DT). Together, these data 
suggest that grafted human NSCs do not produce human endothelial cells34 in 3K3A-APC-
treated mice, and that the improved murine neovascularization is not sufficient to lead to 
functional improvements, but rather that functional benefit requires 3K3A-APC-potentiated 
neuronal production from transplanted NSCs, and a functional integration of those new 
neurons into the host neural circuits.
Regenerative therapies with human NSCs hold great promise for human CNS diseases35, but 
the issue of immunogenicity of allogeneic transplants remains36. Using immunosuppressive 
treatment with cyclosporine, we have observed both good transplantation tolerance and 
functional benefit (Fig. 1a–c), suggesting that this approach may be appropriate for clinical 
translation in stroke. As 3K3A-APC has been shown to be neuroprotective in models of 
larger strokes in rodents with stroke risk factors, and in females and aged rodents6, one 
would expect that 3K3A-APC and NSCs repair therapy would successfully translate to 
different experimental stroke models and humans22.
In summary, our data show that APC agonist-based clinical therapeutics such as 3K3A-APC 
may strongly potentiate the in vivo integration and neurogenic activity of transplanted 
human NSCs. This observation may be of interest not only in the repair of stroke-damaged 
neural circuits, but also in regards to NSC delivery for the broader range of neurological 
disorders involving discrete neuronal loss.
Online Methods
Animals
Eight-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were used in this study. Mice were housed in plastic 
cages on a 12 h light cycle with ad libitum access to water and a standard laboratory diet. 
The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Southern California 
according to the National Institutes of Health guidelines approved all procedures. All the 
animals that survived surgical procedures were included in the study. All animals were 
randomized for all stroke studies and treatments. All experiments were blinded; the 
operators responsible for experimental procedure and data analysis were blinded and 
unaware of group allocation throughout the experiments.
Distal Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (dMCAo)
Mice were anesthetized with 100 mg/kg Ketamine intraperitoneally (IP) and 5–10 mg/kg IP 
xylazine, using a 27-½ gauge needle. Rectal temperature was maintained at 37°C using a 
feedback-controlled heating system. A 1 mm incision was made to expose the skull. A 
modified permanent dMCAo technique was used as previously described6. Briefly, under the 
surgical microscope, the left common carotid artery was isolated through a neck incision and 
ligated using a 5–0 silk. The left distal middle cerebral artery was exposed through a 
craniotomy and permanently cauterized above the rhinal fissure. This model of ischemia 
produces a focal infarct in mice generally localized to the neocortex and the distribution of 
the ischemic lesion at the level of optic chiasm reproducibly involves the primary

 somatosensory cortex region S1 including the forelimb (S1FL) region and the secondary 
somatosensory S2 region in both mice6 and rats37.
Human NSCs culture
Human fetal brain was taken from aborted fetuses of 15–22 weeks gestational age, under a 
protocol approved by the Research Subjects Review Board of the University of Rochester 
Medical Center, as previously described18,19. The samples were collected into Ca/Mg-free 
Hank’s buffered saline solution (HBSS) and dissected to separate the telencephalic VZ/SVZ 
from non-ventricular parenchyma, and dissociated18. The cells were resuspended in 
DMEM/F12/N2 supplemented with 20 ng/ml (1.4 nM) bFGF (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), plated 
in low attachment T-25 flask (Corning, Acton, MA) and maintained as neurospheres. The 
multilineage competence and sustained in vitro self-renewal of these cells, their neural stem 
cell phenotype and their neurogenic potential in vivo have all been previously described18,21. 
On the day of injection, the neural stem cells (NSCs) (passage 2) were dissociated with 
StemPro Accutase (Invitrogen, Catalog #A11105-01) into single-cell suspension in 
DMEM/F12/N2 medium lacking growth factor.
Human NSCs Transplantation
All mice including controls received immunosuppressant cyclosporine (Norvartis, 
Sandimmune 10 mg/kg, i.p.) daily. Seven days after dMCAo, mice were anesthetized placed 
in a stereotactic apparatus (ASI Instruments, Inc., USA) and were fixed accordingly. The 
skull was exposed and a hole was drilled at the appropriate position on the ischemic 
hemisphere. 1×105 NSCs in a total volume of 1 μl were microinjected along the anterior-
posterior axis (three points at the infarct border) into the cortex at a rate of 0.1 μl/min, using 
an infusion pump (World Precision instruments). The injection coordinates were: point #1, 1 
mm anterior to bregma and 2 mm ventral to the brain surface; point #2, 0 mm anterior to 
bregma and 2 mm ventral to the brain surface; point #3, 1 mm posterior to bregma and 1.8 
mm ventral to the brain surface. Human 3K3A-APC (0.2 mg/kg, i.v.) or vehicle was 
administered at 7, 9, 11, and 13 d post-stroke, as previously described5,6.
In vivo imaging of transplanted cells
Bioluminescent and fluorescent lentivirus (pGreenFire: CMV-GFP-T2A-Luciferase) were 
purchased from System Biosciences, Catalog # BLIV101VA-1. For transduction, 0.5 × 106 
single cells in 300 μl of DMEM-F12 medium were inoculated with one viral stock (>2×109 
IFUs) for 1 hour at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere with agitation every 10–15 
minutes, before transferred to T25 flask (Corning). After 24 h, the viral containing medium 
was replaced with complete medium. Transduced neurospheres were collected after 3–4 d 
and dissociated with StemPro Accutase for transplantation. Efficiency of transduction was 
also determined by flow cytometry. 70–80% GFP-positive cells were observed in all 
cultures. Bioluminescent in vivo imaging experiments were performed at using a cooled 
CCD optical macroscopic imaging system (Xenogen-IVIS), as described previously28.

 Assessment of cerebral cortical expansion
Mice anesthetized as above were perfusion fixed with paraformaldehyde 5 weeks after 
stroke and the brains were removed. Whole brain images were captured using a microscopic 
digital camera system coupled to a dissecting stereomicroscope (AxioCam, Zeiss). Images 
were analyzed by the NIH Image J system (Bethesda, MD, USA). The distance from midline 
to the edge of brain on the infarcted hemisphere (x) was divided by the distance from 
midline to the lateral edge on the contralateral, non-infarcted hemisphere (y) to calculate the 
cortical width index (x / y) as previously described24–27.
Behavioral Tests
Rotarod Test—Mice were trained on an accelerating (5–15 rpm) rotating rod (rotarod) for 
3 d before dMCAo; only those mice able to remain on the rod for 200 s at 15 rpm underwent 
dMCAo. Test sessions consisting of four trials at 15 rpm were carried out immediately 
before dMCAo and 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 d later by an investigator who was blinded to the 
experimental groups. The final score was expressed as the mean time that a mouse was able 
to remain on the rod over four trials, as we previously described38.
Adhesive removal test—The adhesive removal test measures sensorimotor function. A 
small piece of adhesive tape (3 mm × 4 mm) was placed on the forepaw contralateral to the 
stroke hemisphere. Time taken to contact and remove adhesive tape was recorded, with a 
maximum of 120 s. Three trials were performed at 0, 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 d after stroke, 
and the mean time of three trials was used to do analysis6,39,40.
Ablation of transplanted NSCs—Cell ablation experiments were performed as 
described previously28,41,42. Diphtheria toxin (DT) was purchased from Sigma 
(Catalog#D0564). Five weeks after dMCAo, DT solution (50 μg/kg) or vehicle was 
administered to mice by intraperitoneal injection, daily for two days. Mice were reassessed 
for behavioral tests within one week of DT or vehicle administration and sacrificed for 
histological analysis. The DT dosing regimen as used in the present study did not lead to any 
functional deficits or structural changes after dMCAo in control mice treated only with DT 
consistent with previous reports in control mice in other models of neurological disorders 
treated with DT28.
HEK 293 cell culture and transplantation—HEK293 cells (ATCC, CRL-1573) were 
cultured in Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 
following supplier’s protocol and tested free of mycoplasma contamination. 1×105 cells in a 
total volume of 1 μl were microinjected following the same protocol listed above for NSCs.
Tissue staining—Animals were transcardially perfused with PBS followed by 4% PFA. 
Brains were postfixed overnight in the same fixative at 4 °C. For cryosectioning, fixed 
tissues were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS overnight at 4 °C, and embedded in OCT 
compound (Tissue Tek). Cryostat sections were cut at 20 μm thickness from the center of the 
lesion (bregma −1 to +1 mm). Three cross sections per mouse, at the levels of bregma −1, 0 
and +1 mm, were selected and permeabilized in PBS-T (PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100) 
for 10 min, blocked with 5% normal goat serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Catalog

 #017-000-121) for 60 min and incubated in primary antibody diluted in blocking solution 
overnight at 4°C. Primary antibodies used in this study include: rabbit monoclonal anti-Tuj1 
(1:100, Cell Signaling Catalog #5568), rat monoclonal anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein 
(GFAP) (1:200, Invitrogen Catalog #13-0300). Mouse monoclonal antibody specific for 
human cytoplasmic marker (Clone SC121, 1:500, StemCells, Inc. Catalog #AB-121-U-050) 
were used together with Mouse on Mouse (M.O.M) kit (Vector Laboratories, Catalog 
#BMK-2202) to stain for transplanted human NSCs. After three washes with PBS, they were 
incubated with the secondary antibodies for 1 h, which are Alexa 488-conjugated donkey 
anti-mouse (1:200, Invitrogen, Catalog#A21202), Alexa 568-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit 
(1:200, Invitrogen, Catalog#A10042). After being rinsed with PBS, nuclei were stained with 
DAPI. Validation is provided on the manufacturer’s website. All images were taken with a 
Zeiss 510 confocal microscopy or using the BZ 9000 all-in-one Fluorescence Microscope 
from Keyence (Osaka, Japan), and analyzed using NIH Image J software. The region of 
interest for cell counting was the ischemia-affected S1 region. Data from randomly selected 
3 sections (100 μm apart) were averaged for each mouse, and 5 mice per group were 
statistically compared. For cell counting in Fig. 2c, e, and f, we analyzed the total number of 
cells per section.
Viral injection for anterograde labeling—Animals were anesthetized with 1.0–1.5% 
isofluorane for the duration of the surgery. Animals were fixed to a stereotaxic frame and a 
~3 cm rostral-caudal incision cut to expose the scalp. The skull was cleaned and dried with 
70% alcohol, then a small cranial window was opened at coordinates 3.2,-1.5,-0.45 mm 
(x,y,z) with a drill, diameter 3 mm. recombinant Adeno-associated virus serotype 2/9 (Penn 
Vector Core, Catalog # AV-9-PV2642) was withdrawn into a pulled glass pipette, diameter 
0.5 mm, filled with mineral oil. The needle was inserted into the cranial window at the rate 
of 1mm/min, 2 min were allowed for the parenchyma to seal over the needle, and then 50 nL 
of the virus was pressure injected at the rate of 10 nL/min via digital controller (World 
Precision Instruments, Catalog # UMP3-1). Two min were allowed for viral diffusion, and 
the needle was then withdrawn at the rate of 1 mm/min. The window was sealed with bone 
wax (Lukens #SUS901), the scalp sutured closed, then animal was placed under heat lamp to 
recover from anesthesia. Animals were housed for recovery and virus propagation for 21 d, 
before sacrificing for histological analysis. In brief, brains were postfixed overnight in PFA 
at 4 °C, and vibratome sectioned at 25 μm thickness. Sections, with TurboRFP labeling in 
the lesioned area (bregma −1 to +1 mm) were collected and stained with SC121 and Tuj1 
antibodies before confocal analysis.
A tiled Z-stack image at 1 μm intervals was acquired for each section, covering the area that 
included both SC121+ cells and TurboRFP+ axons. The region of interest was ischemia-
affected S1 cortex. A contact between grafted neuron-like cells and axonal projection was 
defined as adjacent signal between SC121+ Tuj1+ cells and TurboRFP+ labeled axons from 
orthogonal view in 4 consecutive optical sections (>1 μm) per mouse and from 5 animals per 
group. An example of contact is shown in Figure 3c. The number of contacts were manually 
counted for each section and statistically compared between groups by Student’s t-test.

 Quantifying Synapses—Using compartment-specific antibodies for synaptophysin 
(presynaptic marker, 1:100, Sigma Catalog #SAB4502906) and PSD-95 (postsynaptic 
marker, 1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Catalog sc-6926) we labeled both presynaptic 
terminals as well as sites of postsynaptic specialization in grafted NSCs. Synapses were 
defined as co-localized puncta for both presynaptic and postsynaptic markers on NSCs, as 
previously reported43. The region of interest is the infarcted cortex. Images were obtained on 
a Zeiss LSM 510 using a 63x oil immersion objective. SC121+ 2 cells per image, 5 images 
per section, 1 section per mouse at the level of the optic chiasm and 5 animals per group 
were selected for synapse counting. The number of synapses was quantified using ImageJ.
Voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSD)—Animals were anesthetized with 3.0% 
isofluorane vaporized in air using the SomnoSuite Small Animal Anesthesia System (Kent 
Scientific Catalog # SOMNO). Anesthesia was then maintained at 1.0–1.5% isofluorane for 
the duration of the surgery, with head fixed in a stereotaxic frame (Kopf Instruments). A 
circular cranial window was drilled over the S1 region of the somatosensory cortex (center at 
AP = −0.94 mm, L = 1.5 mm), then RH-1692 VSD (Optical Imaging) dissolved in artificial 
cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) was applied to the exposed cortex for 90 min. The brain was then 
washed with aCSF and cover-slipped with a 3 mm circular glass coverslip sealed using low-
melt agarose (~2%) dissolved in aCSF. Images were captured at 10 ms/frame using a 1/2 
inch MiCAM02-HR CMOS camera (SciMedia) coupled with MiCAM acquisition software 
(SciMedia). RH-1692 was excited using a MHAB-150W (Moritex Corp.) light source with a 
632/22 nm filter, and fluorescence collected with a 665 nm long-pass filter. The contralateral 
forelimb was stimulated by a mechanical vibration lasting 300 ms. Alternating image sets 
were taken with and without stimulus to generate “stimulus trial” and “baseline” responses. 
Next the baseline image set was subtracted from the stimulus trials to eliminate background 
signal and shift-over-time in each trial. 10 baseline subtracted trials were averaged to make 
up the final profile for each experiment. Each frame of a trial and the average intensity of 
each frame were plotted using a custom-made Matlab program (Mathworks Inc.). The 
change in fluorescent VSD signal was calculated as a percentage change by dividing the 
signal intensity after stimulation by the average intensity before stimulation (ΔF / F0). The 
peak amplitude of fluorescent change in a trial and the interval between stimulation onset 
and response peak were also measured using the same program.
In vivo GCaMP3 imaging
GCaMP3 is a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-based calcium sensor that has been frequently 
used for imaging calcium dynamics in living cells including imaging of neural activity in 
worms, flies and mice27. Lenti-CAG-GCaMP3-Puro-WPRE viruses were purchased from 
Cellomics Technology (Catalog # PLV-10076-50, titter: 1 × 108 CFU/ml). Puromycin (1 
μg/mL) selection started 3 d after transduction and continued for 7 d. Neurospheres were 
then collected and dissociated for transplantation. Efficiency of transduction was determined 
by flow cytometry using a regular setting for GFP. Approximately 90% GCaMP3-positive 
cells were observed in all transduced NSCs cultures.
We injected GCaMP3-NSCs (1×105 cells) along the cortical infarct border 7 d after 
permanent dMCAo followed by intravenous treatment with human recombinant 3K3A-APC

 (0.2 mg/kg intravenously) or vehicle 7, 9, 11 and 13 d after stroke. Next, we imaged the 
evoked GCaMP3 signal in response to forelimb mechanical stimulation of S1 region 5 
weeks after stroke using both a transcranial setting with the MiCAM02-HR CMOS camera 
and deep cortical setting with two-photon laser scanning microscope. In these experiments 
mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, placed in a stereotaxic frame, and imaged through a 
cranial window over the S1 region as described above.
Transcranial activity mapping of GCaMP3 signal was performed as previously described30. 
Images of the cortical surface were recorded at 33 ms/frame using a 1/2 inch MiCAM02-HR 
CMOS camera (SciMedia) coupled with MiCAM acquisition software (SciMedia). Calcium 
indicators were excited with blue-light-emitting diodes (Luxeon, 470 nm) with bandpass 
filters (467–499 nm). Emission fluorescence was filtered using a 510–550 nm bandpass 
filter. The contralateral forelimb was stimulated by a mechanical vibration lasting 300 ms. 
To calculate the calcium response evoked by stimulation, 10 trials separated by a 10 s 
interval were collected, averaged and normalized to the average baseline recorded before 
stimulation, using a custom-made Matlab program. The change in fluorescent GFP signal 
was calculated as a percentage change by dividing the signal intensity after stimulation by 
the average intensity before stimulation (ΔF / F0). The peak amplitude of fluorescent change 
in a trial and the interval between stimulation onset and response peak were also measured 
using the same program.
In vivo deep cortical imaging of GCaMP3-positive grafted cells was performed on a two-
photon laser-scanning microscope (LSM 5 MP) with a Mai-Tai 80 femtosecond pulsed laser 
(Spectra-Physics) running at 900 nm for GCaMP3, as previously described31. Images (128 × 
128 pixels) were collected at 4 Hz. To calculate the calcium response evoked by stimulation, 
10 trials separated by a 10 s interval were collected, averaged and normalized to the average 
baseline recorded before stimulation, using a custom-made Matlab program. The change in 
fluorescent GFP signal was calculated as a percentage change by dividing the signal 
intensity after stimulation by the average intensity before stimulation (ΔF / F0). The peak 
amplitude of fluorescent change in a trial and the interval between stimulation onset and 
response peak were also measured using the same program. The region of interest was the 
S1 region. In each mouse individual GCaMP3-NSCs cell responses to forelimb stimulus 
were determined from 20–30 cells. 5 mice were compared between groups.
Flow cytometry
Quantitative flow cytometry analyses were performed using the Attune NxT Acoustic 
Focusing Cytometer, as we previously described19. Briefly, the cells were harvested from in 
vitro cultures or collected after dissection of ischemic brain regions with transplants, and 
stained with various markers as indicated, following a standard indirect flow cytometry 
protocol (Abcam). Quantitative analyses were performed using the Attune® Cytometric 
Software. PE-conjugated mouse anti-human CD31 (1:50; BD Pharmingen, clone WM59, 
#555446; minimal cross reactivity with murine endogenous CD31) was used.

 In vivo lectin-FITC angiography
Dylight 488-labeled L. esculentum (tomato) lectin at 10 mg/kg was administered via the 
femoral vein in anesthetized mice 5 min before killing4, five weeks after dMCAo. For the 
analysis of blood vessels, sections from brains that were used for in vivo lectin-FITC 
angiography were incubated with an antibody specific to murine CD31 (1:50; Invitrogen, 
#RM5200) overnight at 4°C followed by incubation with the secondary antibodies (TRITC-
conjugated donkey anti-rat IgG; 1:200; Invitrogen #A18750). Total microvascular length 
was calculated using the NeuronJ plugin for ImageJ, as previously described4.
Statistics
Sample sizes were calculated using nQUERY assuming a two-sided alpha-level of 0.05, 
80% power, and homogeneous variances for the 2 samples to be compared, with the means 
and common standard deviation for different parameters predicted from published data and 
our previous studies. Data are presented as mean ± s.d., or means ± s.e.m. as indicated in the 
figure legends. For comparison between two groups, F test was conducted to determine the 
similarity in the variances between the groups that are statistically compared, and statistical 
significance was analyzed by Student’s t-test. For multiple comparisons, Bartlett’s test for 
equal variances was used to determine the variances between the multiple groups and one-
way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni’s post hoc test was used to test 
statistical significance, using GraphPad Prism software. A P value of less than 0.05 was 
considered statistically significant.
