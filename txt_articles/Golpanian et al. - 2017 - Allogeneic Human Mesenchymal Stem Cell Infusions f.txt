Abstract
Background: Impaired endogenous stem cell repair capacity is hypothesized to be a biologic basis of frailty. Therapies that restore regenerative 
capacity may therefore be beneficial. This Phase 1 study evaluated the safety and potential efficacy of intravenous, allogeneic, human 
mesenchymal stem cell (allo-hMSC)-based therapy in patients with aging frailty.
Methods: In this nonrandomized, dose-escalation study, patients received a single intravenous infusion of allo-hMSCs: 20-million (n = 5), 
100-million (n = 5), or 200-million cells (n = 5). The primary endpoint was incidence of any treatment-emergent serious adverse events 
measured at 1 month postinfusion. The secondary endpoints were functional efficacy domains and inflammatory biomarkers, measured at 3 
and 6 months, respectively.
Results: There were no treatment-emergent serious adverse events at 1-month postinfusion or significant donor-specific immune reactions 
during the first 6 months. There was one death at 258 days postinfusion in the 200-million group. In all treatment groups, 6-minute walk 
distance increased at 3 months (p = .02) and 6 months (p = .001) and TNF-α levels decreased at 6 months (p < .0001). Overall, the 100-million 
dose showed the best improvement in all parameters, with the exception of TNF-α, which showed an improvement in both the 100- and 
200-million groups (p = .0001 and p = .0001, respectively). The 100-million cell-dose group also showed significant improvements in the 
physical component of the SF-36 quality of life assessment at all time points relative to baseline.
Conclusions: Allo-hMSCs are safe and immunologically tolerated in aging frailty patients. Improvements in functional and immunologic 
status suggest that ongoing clinical development of cell-based therapy is warranted for frailty.

 Frailty is a medical syndrome characterized by age-related diminished 
physiologic function, endurance, and strength that can be secondary 
to a multitude of factors and is associated with a high risk of hospi-
talizations, worse clinical outcomes, dependency, and mortality (1,2). 
The overall prevalence of frailty is estimated to be 9.9% and is more 
common in females as well as those with chronic disease (3). The 
etiology of frailty is multifaceted, with an age-related decline in either 
physical, psychological, or a combination of the two components at 
the helm of the disease process (1). As a result, patients with frailty 
will often experience a reduction in “life span” and a corresponding 
increase in dependence on others for activities of daily living. Over 
time, the elderly and frail individuals in particularly, begin to lack the 
ability to adapt to adverse environmental stressors secondary due to 
their lack of “physiologic reserve,” which leads to impaired function 
and increases their vulnerability to death (4–7). Frail patients can be 
classified based on severity, as frailty has been characterized as a phe-
notypic spectrum through which patients  transition (8).
Therapeutic interventions for aging frailty have mainly focused 
on exercise, nutritional supplements, and multidisciplinary methods 
(9,10). The goal of any potential therapy for frailty is to extend the 
well-being and ability of a patient to regenerate functionality. In this 
regard, one of the key hypotheses of the aging frailty is an acceler-
ated depletion of endogenous stem cells, thereby contributing to a 
reduced ability to regenerate or repair organs and tissues (11,12). 
Accordingly, a cell-based, regenerative treatment strategy could ame-
liorate signs and symptoms of frailty (13,14–16).
Bone marrow–derived human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) 
home to sites of injury, reduce inflammation and fibrosis, stimulate 
endogenous stem cells, and contribute to tissue regeneration (17). 
Clinical studies have demonstrated that hMSCs improve cardiac 
structure and function in patients with acute myocardial infarc-
tion (18) and ischemic and nonischemic heart failure (19,20). 
Importantly, hMSCs are immunomodulatory (21) and data from 
multiple clinical trials show that allogeneic hMSCs are safe (17–
20,22) irrespective of age (23). Increased chronic inflammation 
(24,25) and declines in cardiovascular reserve (26) have been iden-
tified in aging frail patients. These features of aging frailty support 
the hypothesis that hMSCs ameliorate or improve frailty.
The purpose of this Phase 1 pilot study, AllogeneiC Human 
Mesenchymal Stem Cell in Patients with Aging FRailTy via 
IntravenoUS Delivery (CRATUS) (27), was to evaluate the safety 
and tolerability of allogeneic hMSCs (allo-hMSCs) in patients with 
aging frailty and to explore domains of treatment efficacy of allo-
hMSCs through the reduction of signs and symptoms of aging frailty. 
The study also sought to gain insight regarding optimal dosing of 
allo-hMSCs and potential mechanistic properties of intravenous 
allo-hMSC therapy in frailty vis-à-vis immune monitoring and meas-
urements of changes in systemic biomarkers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The AllogeneiC Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell in Patients with 
Aging FRailTy via IntravenoUS Delivery (CRATUS) Study (www.
clinicaltrials.gov: #NCT02065245) was a nonrandomized, non-
blinded, escalated dose pilot Phase 1 study in which a total of 15 
patients were enrolled for an infusion of human donor bone mar-
row–derived allo-hMSCs, delivered via peripheral intravenous infu-
sion, as previously described in detail (27). Patients were scheduled 
to receive 20-million (Group 1, n = 5), 100-million (Group 2, n = 5), 
or 200-million (Group 3, n = 5) allo-hMSCs.
The study was approved by the Internal Review Board (IRB) at 
the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine (IRB approval #: 
20130646) and monitored by a Data and Safety Monitoring Board. 
All subjects provided written informed consent before participating. 
Table 1 lists the complete study inclusion and exclusion criteria. See 
Supplementary Material for full description of the Methods.
Results
Study subjects (n = 15) had a 2:1 male to female ratio and an average 
age of 78.4 ± 4.7 years (Table 2). Over half of the patients (n = 8) 
were considered “vulnerable” with a Clinical Frailty Score (28,29) 
of 4, whereas the remainder scored a 5 (“mild” frailty; n = 6) or 6 
(“moderate” frailty; n = 1). At baseline, the mean 6-minute walk 
distance (6MWD) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) 
were 382.6 ± 102.7 m and 2.3 ± 0.4 L, respectively. There was no sig-
nificant difference between patients of each cell-dose group in either 
of these parameters. The average Mini-Mental State Examination 
(MMSE) score in this study cohort was 28.5 ± 1.4. Blood laboratory 
counts between patients were similar at baseline.
Allo-hMSCs were well tolerated in all three cell-dose groups with 
no treatment-related serious adverse events (SAE) observed during the 
12-month postinfusion follow-up period. There were no persistent 
cardiopulmonary signs or symptoms observed immediately following 
infusion. Supplementary Table 1 and Table 3 list the adverse events 
(AE) and SAE’s for this trial. Two subjects in the 20-million cell-dose 
group were hospitalized on Day 102 and 311 postinfusion for an SAE 
(uncontrolled hypertension and hypercalcemia, respectively); however, 
both events were considered unrelated to the product. Additionally, 
one infusion-related AE (intravenous infiltration) occurred in the 
20-million cell-dose group, which was considered mild in severity 
and soon thereafter resolved. One subject in the 200-million cell-dose

 group experienced a sudden cardiac death 258 days postinfusion, 
which was determined to be unrelated to the study product.
Immunologic response to allo-hMSCs was assessed using panel 
reactive antibodies (PRA) testing. The calculated PRA (cPRA) 
was assessed at Day 1 and 6 months postinfusion. The change in 
percent cPRA depicts that only one patient in the 20-million allo-
hMSC group developed a new donor-specific moderate (26%) 
cPRA reaction (Figure 1A). There were no signs of early T cell acti-
vation (CD69) at 6 months post-allo-hMSC as compared to base-
line in all treatment groups (20-million: −8.28%, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] −21.68–5.12, p = .20; 100-million: −6.84%, 95% CI 
−20.24–6.56, p = .29; 200-million: −1.56%, 95% CI −14.97–11.84, 
p = .80; Figure 1B). Lastly, allo-hMSCs did not induce late/chronic 
(CD25) T cell activation in any of the treatment groups. Of note, 
the late/chronic T cell activation was significantly reduced in the 
20-million group (20-million: −14.18%, 95% CI −26.96–−1.40, 
p = .03), although not in the other treatment groups at 6 months 
post-allo-hMSC as compared to baseline (100-million: −6.9%, 
95% CI −19.68–5.88, p = .26; 200-million: −0.18, 95% CI −12.96–
12.60, p = .98; Figure 1C). In summary, all 15 subjects tolerated the 
infusions well, with only one subject (20-million group) developing 
mild to moderate donor-specific antibodies.
For all cell-dose groups combined, distance walked in 6 minutes 
increased at 3 months (22.6 m [95% CI: 3.5, 41.7], p = .02) and 
at 6 months (39.3 m [95% CI: 18.7, 60.0], p = .001) postinfusion. 
Subjects in the 100-million allo-hMSC cell-dose group demonstrated 
the largest improvement from baseline at 3 months (36.6 m [95% 
CI: 3.5, 69.7], p = .03; Figure 2A) and at 6 months (76.6 m [95% 
CI: 40.8, 112.4], p = .0005; Figure 2A). No statistically significant 
mean increase relative to baseline was seen in the 200-million cell-
dose group (Table 4). Assessments of handgrip strength and exercise-
induced change in ejection fraction did not reveal significant changes 
in any of the treatment groups.
With regards to FEV1, the combined cell-dose groups showed a 
trend of improvement at 3 months (0.12 L [95% CI: 0.0007, 0.24], 
p = .05) and 6 months (0.09 L [95% CI: −0.06, 0.24], p = .23). 
Subjects in the 200-million allo-hMSC cell-dose group showed 
the greatest improvement in FEV1 relative to baseline at 3 months 
postinfusion (0.26 L [95% CI: 0.05, 0.47], p = .02) and 6 months 
postinfusion (0.23 L [95% CI: −0.03, 0.49], p = .08; Figure 2B).

 Cognitive status, as assessed by the MMSE was evaluated at 
baseline and 6 months postinfusion. The 100-million cell-dose group 
exhibited the most improvement in MMSE with a median total score 
change of 2.0 (interquartile range [IQR]: 1.0–2.0), compared to the 
20-million cell-dose group (0.5, IQR: −0.5–2.5) and the 200-million 
cell-dose group (0.0, IQR: 0.0–0.0), although this was not a signifi-
cant increase from baseline (p = .13). However, there was a statisti-
cally significant improvement in the combined cell-dose group from 
baseline (0.5 [IQR: 0.0–2.0], p = .04).
Quality of life was assessed at 1, 3, and 6 months postinfusion by 
the SF-36 and EQ-5D questionnaires. The SF-36 questionnaire is made 
up of a physical component score and a mental component score. The 
100-million allo-hMSCs cell-dose group showed a significant improve-
ment in the physical component score at 1 month (10.48 [95% CI: 
4.70, 16.26], p = .002), 3 months (6.92 [95% CI: 0.78, 13.06], p = .03), 
and 6 months (7.80 [95% CI: 0.59, 15.02], p = .03; Figure 2C). No 
significant changes from baseline were found in any of the cell-dose 
groups for the mental component score. Additionally, there were no 
significant changes from baseline for the EQ-5D questionnaire.
Evaluation of inflammatory marker assessments revealed a sig-
nificant decrease in TNF-α in the 100-million and 200-million treat-
ment arms (Figure 3). The 20-million allo-hMSC cell-dose group 
exhibited a moderate change (−1.2 [95% CI: −2.7, 0.2], p = .09), 
whereas the 100-million and 200-million allo-hMSC cell-dose 
groups showed a more pronounced change from baseline (−3.7 
[95% CI: −5.1, −2.2], p = .0001) and (−3.8 [95% CI: −5.2, −2.3], 
p = .0001), respectively. No significant changes were seen in CRP, 
IL-6, fibrinogen, D-dimer, or white blood cell counts in this study.
Discussion
The major new findings of CRATUS are that intravenous allo-hMSC 
infusions are safe and well tolerated in elderly individuals with early 
signs and symptoms of frailty. Importantly, there were improvements 
in a constellation of parameters that are important predictors of 
morbidity and mortality in patients with aging frailty.
With no current standard of care for frailty, allo-hMSCs may hold 
great promise as a cell therapy agent for patients with this syndrome. 
The underlying basis for positive effects of allo-MSCs are likely due, 
at least in part, to anti-inflammatory and proregenerative effects (21). 
In this regard, frailty is characterized by systemic inflammation (17) 
and low “reserve capacity” of organ systems thought due to dimin-
ished endogenous stem cell production (16). Though baseline stem 
cell levels are difficult to detect, aging in itself is likely associated with 
reduced stem cells (11,12) and of those which remain viable, there is 
a loss in their differentiation capacity types (15), which could contrib-
ute to a decline in multiorgan physiologic reserve. Replenishment of 
the body’s stem cell “factory” and/or revitalization of stem cell niches 
via intravenous infusion of allo-hMSCs may help treat the morbidi-
ties associated with aging frailty. Additionally, the decline in func-
tion of aged stem cells (12) can be circumvented by administration of 
young donor allo-hMSCs that do not exhibit senescence or functional 
impairments that are a characteristic of older donor MSCs (13,16).
The safety of allogeneic MSC therapy has been demonstrated in 
numerous studies (18–20,22). Additionally, cPRA testing indicated 
that infusion of allo-hMSCs does not induce a clinically relevant 
Figure 1. Immune monitoring. (A) Effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) 
on cPRA. Change in Calculated Panel Reactive Antibody (cPRA) assay from 
day 1 to 6 months demonstrates that only one subject in the 20-million (M) 
arm had a moderate donor-specific cPRA reaction and no subjects in the 
100M and the 200M group had any reaction. (B) Effects of MSCs on early T 
cell activation. Change in T cells expression of early activation marker CD69 
demonstrates that allo-hMSCs in all treatment arms suppresses early T cell 
activation. (C) Effects of MSCs of late/chronic T cell activation. Change in T 
cells expression of late/chronic activation marker CD25 demonstrates that 
allo-hMSCs in all treatment arms did not induce late/chronic 
T cell activation 
and the 20 million dose significantly suppressed activation (*p = .03) at 6 mo 
as compared to baseline.

 immune response. This may be related to the immunoregulatory 
properties of MSCs (21), specifically on T-helper and T-regulatory 
cells (30). Furthermore, our data demonstrate that the allo-hMSCs 
had an immunomodulatory effect suppressing early and late/chronic 
T cell activation markers in all treatment groups.
At 6 months postinfusion, we observed a significant decrease in 
the inflammatory biomarker TNF-α in all cell-dose groups, with the 
greatest change in the 100- and 200-million groups. These findings 
corroborate the association between elevated cytokines and systemic 
inflammation, as well as the role of this marker in the accelerated 
aging process (24). Indeed, systemic inflammatory biomarkers have 
been implicated in augmenting cell mitochondrial dysfunction, 
altered cell-to-cell interactions, and stem cell reserve exhaustion (4). 
Moreover, elevated inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α have been 
linked to the disruption of physiological organ systems and their 
homeostatic properties (24). Other biomarkers, including IL-6 and 
CRP, did not show any significant decrease following cell therapy in 
this Phase 1 study, although these cytokines have been previously 
found to be associated with aging frailty (24,31).
The 6MWD is a validated field test, widely used to assess func-
tional exercise capacity, treatment effectiveness, and prognosis since 
it is accurate, reproducible, easy to administer, and well-tolerated by 
patients (32–35). It has been commonly used as a prognostic instru-
ment to assess the functional status of patients with cardiovascular 
(32,36), pulmonary (33), and more recently, muscular diseases (34). 
Using the 6MWD to evaluate physical functioning after allo-hMSC 
intravenous infusion therapy in patients with frailty, we observed 
significant improvements in distance walked in the 20-million and 
100-million cell-dose groups, with the greatest change seen in the 
100-million group. Interestingly, we did not find a significant dif-
ference in the 200-million cell-dose group. Although safety and 
tolerability was demonstrated at this cell-dose, significantly valid 
conclusions can only be made regarding efficacy with additional 
studies (37). Similarly, in regards to efficacy, it is important to note 
that there may be an effect in regards to practice with the 6MWD 
over time. Importantly, the 6MWD test is particularly applicable to 
frailty as it is an integrated global assessment of patients’ cardiac, 
respiratory, circulatory, as well as muscular capacities. Age-related 
skeletal muscle loss, or sarcopenia, can lead to diminished strength, 
lack of endurance, and low tolerance for physical exertion; all com-
mon core clinical presentations of frailty (7). Indeed, the strong 
association between sarcopenia and functional impairment in older 
patients has been reported (38). As such, the 6MWD can be used as 
a meaningful reflection of a frail patient’s ability to perform basic 
activities of daily living and given the improvement noted in this 
study, future clinical testing of intravenous allo-hMSC infusion in 
frail subjects is warranted.
The minimal clinically important difference MCID is defined 
as the smallest difference in score in the domain of interest, which 
patients perceive as beneficial and which would mandate a change 
in patient management (39). In regard to the 6MWD, Perera and 
colleagues have suggested that an improvement by more than 49 
m is considered a “substantial change” (40) and this threshold was 
indeed exceeded in the 100-million group. However, it is important

 to consider that although small changes may be statistically signifi-
cant, they may not be clinically relevant. The MCID is a dynamic 
and subjective concept, and its derivations are usually estimated 
for a specific population at a particular stage of recovery (32). 
Therefore, the fact that 6MWD improves after cell-therapy in this 
study warrants future clinical testing of intravenous allo-MSC infu-
sion therapy on efficacy outcomes.
Other outcome measurements for efficacy in this Phase 1 trial, 
including pulmonary function and cognitive function, showed vari-
able results or suggested trends. In regards to the MMSE, the analy-
sis of all cell-dose groups combined showed significant improvement 
from baseline raising an intriguing possibility that MSCs may 
improve cognition, a prediction that will require further testing.
Taken together, the dose-finding portion of this study supports 
the idea that 100-million cells represent the optimal dose level, 
with no added benefit or loss of effect at the 200-million dose. 
Interestingly, TNF-α levels appear to be a useful biomarker of effi-
cacy in this population, as they decline in response to all doses of 
allo-hMSCs. Studies in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy also 
suggest a dose threshold effect. However, the small sample size of 
this Phase 1 and inadequate powering of the secondary outcomes 
likely contributed to the mixed results noted in regards to pulmo-
nary function and cognition. Phase 2 clinical trials in aging frailty 
patients with larger sample sizes and blinded, randomized study 
designs are underway that are designed to confirm or refute the pro-
vocative efficacy results shown here. Another limitation of this study 
was the patient demographics. All subjects were of white race, with 
no inclusion of African Americans or Hispanics, which would be 
reasonable to attain in a larger, Phase 2 study sample.
In the United States, the population of individuals 65 years 
and older is projected to increase to almost 30 times the num-
ber recorded in 1990 (3,080,498 persons) (NP2008-T12, U.S. 
Administration on Aging). Although the overall prevalence of 
aging frailty has been reported to be near 10%, studies have shown 
a wide range in the actual prevalence numbers, from less than 5% 
to 59% (3). This phenomenon is at least in part due to the lack 
of consensus on the syndrome’s true defining criteria in addition 
to the array of models used to describe it (41). The various sets 
of diagnostic models for the syndrome are related to the fact that 
frailty involves social and psychological components in addition 
to physical or clinical symptoms (5–7). Therefore, no single model

 exists that can comprehensively encompass all the essential aspects 
of the syndrome. As patients with frailty are a major source of med-
ical resource expenditures, early interventions and/or treatments 
for this disease can improve patient quality of life in addition to 
lowering healthcare costs (42).
In conclusion, intravenous administration of allo-hMSCs was 
safe, well tolerated, and free from any concerning adverse events. 
Furthermore, given the promising results of this study, larger, double-
blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trials examining the potential ben-
efits of allo-hMSCs are warranted to further bolster understanding of 
the efficacy profile of allo-MSCs in individuals with aging frailty.
