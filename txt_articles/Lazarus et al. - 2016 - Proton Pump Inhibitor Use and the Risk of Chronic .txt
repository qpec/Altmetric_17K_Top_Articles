IMPORTANCE Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the most commonly used drugs
worldwide and have been linked to acute interstitial nephritis. Less is known about the
association between PPI use and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
OBJECTIVE To quantify the association between PPI use and incident CKD in a
population-based cohort.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In total, 10 482 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in
Communities study with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of at least 60 mL/min/1.73 m2
were followed from a baseline visit between February 1, 1996, and January 30, 1999, to
December 31, 2011. The data was analyzed from May 2015 to October 2015. The findings were
replicated in an administrative cohort of 248 751 patients with an estimated glomerular
filtration rate of at least 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 from the Geisinger Health System.
EXPOSURES Self-reported PPI use in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study or an
outpatient PPI prescription in the Geisinger Health System replication cohort. Histamine2 (H2)
receptor antagonist use was considered a negative control and active comparator.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incident CKD was defined using diagnostic codes at
hospital discharge or death in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, and by a
sustained outpatient estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in
the Geisinger Health System replication cohort.
RESULTS Among 10 482 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study, the
mean (SD) age was 63.0 (5.6) years, and 43.9% were male. Compared with nonusers, PPI
users were more often of white race, obese, and taking antihypertensive medication. Proton
pump inhibitor use was associated with incident CKD in unadjusted analysis (hazard ratio
[HR], 1.45; 95% CI, 1.11-1.90); in analysis adjusted for demographic, socioeconomic, and
clinical variables (HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.14-1.96); and in analysis with PPI ever use modeled as a
time-varying variable (adjusted HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.17-1.55). The association persisted when
baseline PPI users were compared directly with H2 receptor antagonist users (adjusted HR,
1.39; 95% CI, 1.01-1.91) and with propensity score–matched nonusers (HR, 1.76; 95% CI,
1.13-2.74). In the Geisinger Health System replication cohort, PPI use was associated with CKD
in all analyses, including a time-varying new-user design (adjusted HR, 1.24; 95% CI,
1.20-1.28). Twice-daily PPI dosing (adjusted HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.28-1.67) was associated with a
higher risk than once-daily dosing (adjusted HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.09-1.21).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Proton pump inhibitor use is associated with a higher risk of
incident CKD. Future research should evaluate whether limiting PPI use reduces the incidence
of CKD.

C
hronickidneydisease(CKD)affectsapproximately13.6%
of adults in the United States,1 is associated with a sub-
stantially increased risk of death and cardiovascular
events,2 and accounts for a disproportionately large burden on
thefinancialresourcesofMedicare.1 Theincreasingprevalence
ofCKDamongcommunitiescannotbefullyexplainedbytrends
in known risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus and hyperten-
sion, suggesting that other variables may contribute to the dis-
ease process.3,4 Medication use may be a potential factor, par-
ticularly given tendencies toward polypharmacy.5 Identifying
iatrogenicriskfactorsforCKDmayhelptopromotetherational
use of medications and reduce the burden of CKD worldwide.
Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are one of the most com-
monly prescribed medications in the United States, and it has
been estimated that between 25% and 70% of these prescrip-
tions have no appropriate indication.6 The duration of use fre-
quently extends beyond recommended guidelines.7,8 There is
alsoatrendtowardPPIuseininfantsandchildren.9,10Sincethe
introduction of PPIs to the US market in 1990, several observa-
tionalstudieshavelinkedPPIusetouncommonbutseriousad-
verse health outcomes, including hip fracture,11 community-
acquired pneumonia,12 Clostridium difficile infection,13 acute
interstitial nephritis,14,15 and acute kidney injury (AKI).16-18 It
is plausible that PPI use may also be a risk factor for CKD, po-
tentially mediated by recurrent AKI,19,20 or by hypomagnese-
mia,whichhasbeenassociatedwithPPIuse21andwithincident
CKD.22 To our knowledge, no population-based studies have
evaluated the association between PPI use and the risk of CKD.
The objective of this study was to quantify the associa-
tion between PPI use and incident kidney disease in the gen-
eral population. We hypothesized that PPI use is an indepen-
dent risk factor for CKD and that the use of Histamine2 (H2)
receptor antagonists, another common class of medications
used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease, is not. As a sec-
ondary outcome, we also evaluated the association between
PPI use and AKI. Analyses were performed in the Atheroscle-
rosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, a long-running popu-
lation-based cohort, and were replicated in patients receiv-
ing care in the Geisinger Health System, an integrated health
system in rural Pennsylvania.
Methods
Study Design and Setting of the ARIC Study
The ARIC study is a prospective cohort study of 15 792 adults
45 to 64 years old who were recruited as a population-based
sample from 4 US communities (Forsyth, North Carolina;
Jackson, Mississippi; suburban Minneapolis, Minnesota; and
Washington County, Maryland). Participants attended the first
visit between January 12, 1987, and March 29, 1990, and at-
tended subsequent visits at 3-year intervals until their fourth
visit between February 1, 1996, and January 30, 1999. Visit 5
occurred between June 1, 2011, and August 30, 2013. The dates
of our study analysis were from February 1, 1996 (ARIC study
visit 4) to December 31, 2011. The ARIC study has been ap-
proved by the institutional review boards at the University of
Minnesota (Minneapolis), The Johns Hopkins University
(Baltimore, Maryland), Wake Forest University (Winston-
Salem, North Carolina), University of North Carolina (Winston-
Salem), University of Texas Health Sciences Center at Houston,
and University of Mississippi Medical Center (Jackson). Par-
ticipants provided written informed consent. All participants
were followed up through an annual telephone survey and a
review of community hospital discharge lists until December
31, 2011. Deaths were determined by a telephone survey of
alternative contacts and surveillance of local newspaper obitu-
aries, state death lists, and death certificates from the Depart-
ment of Vital Statistics. Further details about the ARIC study
cohort have been published previously.23
Participants in the ARIC Study
For the present study, we included the 11 656 participants who
attendedvisit4.Theratioofurinaryalbuminleveltocreatinine

werealsoexcluded,resultinginastudypopulationof10482par-
ticipants. The use of the full data set with multiple imputation
formissingvariablesdidnotchangetheinference;therefore,we
used the complete case analysis. The study population for the
secondary outcome of AKI excluded persons with known end-
stage renal disease (ESRD) or an eGFR of less than 15 mL/min/
1.73 m2 (n = 50). Therefore, it included some participants with
an eGFR of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 but was otherwise
similarly constructed (n = 11 145).
Measurement of Incident Kidney Disease in the ARIC Study
Incident CKD was defined by diagnostic codes that indicated
CKD at hospital discharge (International Classification of Dis-
eases,NinthRevision,ClinicalModification[ICD-9-CM])ordeath
(ICD-10-CM) or by incident ESRD, as determined through link-
age with the United States Renal Data System registry.24,25 In
an earlier validation study24 that used at least a 25% decline
in the eGFR to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 at a follow-up out-
patient visit as a reference standard for CKD, the sensitivity of
diagnostic codes for defining CKD was 35.5%, and the speci-
ficity was 95.7%. Incident AKI was defined by hospitalization
or death, with ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM diagnostic codes of
584.x or N17.x, respectively.26 Participants who died before de-
veloping CKD, were lost to follow-up, or had disease-free sur-
vival to December 31, 2011, were censored.
Measurement of PPI Use and Other Covariates
in the ARIC Study
The use of PPIs and H2 receptor antagonists was measured at
the baseline study visit through direct visual inspection of pill
bottles for all medications used during the preceding 2 weeks.

Collaboration was used to calculate the eGFR.27 The urinary al-

Behring or IMMAGE; Beckman).24 Three domains of socioeco-
nomic status were measured, including self-reported highest
level of education, health insurance status, and annual house-
hold income in the previous 12 months. Cigarette smoking sta-
tus was defined categorically as a current, former, or never
smoker at baseline, and the BMI was derived. Prevalent hyper-
tension was defined as a systolic blood pressure of at least
140 mm Hg, a diastolic blood pressure of at least 90 mm Hg, or
self-reporteduseofantihypertensivemedicationwithinthepast

bloodglucoseconcentrationofatleast126mg/dL,arandomglu-
cose concentration of at least 200 mg/dL, self-report of a phy-
sician diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, or reported use of medi-
cation for diabetes in the past 2 weeks (to convert glucose

come of prevalent coronary heart disease or stroke at visit 4.
Geisinger Health System Replication Cohort
Thereplicationcohortconsistedof248751patientswithanout-
patient eGFR of at least 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 receiving care be-
tween February 13, 1997, and October 9, 2014, in the Geisinger
Health System, a large rural health care system in central and
northeasternPennsylvania.Participantswereselectedattheear-
liest time point when they had both creatinine level and sys-
tolic blood pressure available. Incident CKD was defined as the
first outpatient eGFR of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 that was
sustained at all subsequent assessments of the eGFR or as the
development of ESRD, which was ascertained through linkage
to the United States Renal Data System registry. Incident AKI
was defined as an ICD-9-CM code of 584.x, and death was as-
certained through linkage to the National Death Index. Indi-
viduals who did not develop the outcome of interest were cen-
sored at their last follow-up or death. Medication use was
determined by prescriber prescription within 90 days before
baseline.ThefrequencyofPPIusewascategorizedasoncedaily
or twice daily according to the prescription and was assumed
to be once daily if not specified. Comorbidities were captured
by inpatient and outpatient billing codes.
Statistical Analysis
Baseline characteristics of PPI users and non–PPI users were
compared using t tests for continuous variables and χ2 tests for
categorical variables. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for
continuous variables that were not normally distributed. Cox
proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the haz-
ard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs of incident CKD associated with
PPIuse.Theproportionalhazardsassumptionwastestedusing
Schoenfeldresiduals.ExposuretoPPIswasmodeledasabinary
variableatbaselineandinsecondaryanalysesasatime-varying
ever-usevariable,inwhichaparticipantwasconsideredanever
user at the first instance of PPI use and at all time points there-
after. In the ARIC study, time-varying PPI use represented
baselineuse,withupdatesin2006andyearlythereafter;inthe
replication cohort, it was evaluated by assessing all health care
professional prescriptions throughout the study period. In the
ARIC study, adjustment was performed for demographic vari-
ables (age, sex, race, and study center), socioeconomic status
(health insurance and highest level of education), clinical mea-
surements (baseline eGFR, logarithm of the ratio of urinary al-
bumin to creatinine, cigarette smoking, mean systolic blood
pressure, and BMI), prevalent comorbidities (diabetes mellitus
and cardiovascular disease), and concomitant use of medica-
tions (antihypertensive medication and anticoagulant medica-
tion). Annual household income and concomitant use of non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin, diuretics, or statin
medications were considered possible confounders a priori;
however,theydidnotaffecttheresultsofadjustedanalysesand
were not included in the final model. In the replication cohort,
fewer comorbidities were available; therefore, analyses were
adjusted for age, sex, race, baseline eGFR, cigarette smoking,
BMI, systolic blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, history of car-
diovascular disease, antihypertensive medication use, antico-
agulant medication use, and statin, aspirin, and nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drug use. Subgroup analyses were per-
formed,stratifiedbythemedianage,sex,race(intheARICstudy
only), diabetes mellitus, and concomitant medication use.
In the replication cohort, the risk of CKD was also evalu-
ated in once-daily and twice-daily PPI users. Similar analyses
were performed for the secondary outcome of AKI. Absolute
risk differences were estimated as the difference between the
expected 10-year risk among PPI users and the expected
10-year risk had they not used PPIs.
Five sensitivity analyses were performed. First, the study
population was limited to participants using H2 receptor an-
tagonistsorPPIs,andtheriskofkidneydiseaseassociatedwith
PPI use was assessed using H2 receptor antagonists as the ac-
tive comparator. Second, the association between PPI use and
incident kidney disease was examined in a propensity score–
matched cohort, in which logistic regression was used to es-
timate the probability of PPI use based on observable predic-
tors of PPI use, and controls not using PPIs were selected using
1:1 nearest-neighbor matching. Third, a new-user design was
used, whereby the risk associated with time-varying PPI ever
use was assessed only among persons not using PPIs at
baseline.28 Given that new use was not available until 2006
in the ARIC study, this analysis was performed only in the rep-
lication cohort. Fourth, the association between H2 receptor
antagonist use and incident kidney disease was assessed as a
negative control. Fifth, persons with a baseline ratio of uri-
nary albumin to creatinine exceeding 30 mg/g (or 1+ protein
on dipstick in the replication cohort) were excluded from the
study population. All analyses were performed using statisti-
cal software (Stata/IC, version 13.1; StataCorp LP).
Results
Study Population
In the ARIC study, 10 482 participants were followed up
for a median of 13.9 years. In the replication cohort,
248 751 participants were followed up for a median
of 6.2 years. At baseline in both cohorts, PPI users were
more likely than nonusers to have a higher BMI and
take antihypertensive, aspirin, or statin medications

(Table 1). The characteristics of H2 receptor antagonist
users were similar to those of PPI users. The prevalence
of ever use of PPIs increased substantially during
the follow-up period (Figure 1).
Association Between PPI Use and Kidney Disease
in the ARIC Study
In the ARIC study, there were 56 incident CKD events
among the 322 baseline PPI users (14.2 per 1000 person-
years), and 1382 events among 10 160 baseline nonusers
(10.7 per 1000 person-years). In unadjusted analysis, par-
ticipants who used PPIs at baseline had 1.45 (95% CI, 1.11-
1.90; P = .006) times the risk of incident CKD relative to that
of nonusers (Table 2). The risk was similar after adjustment
for potential confounders, including demographics, socio-
economic status, clinical measurements, prevalent comor-
bidities, and concomitant use of medications (HR, 1.50; 95%
CI, 1.14-1.96; P = .003), as was the association when PPI use
was modeled as a time-varying ever-use variable (HR, 1.35;
95% CI, 1.17-1.55; P < .001). Subgroup analyses were consis-
tent with the primary results (Figure 2). The 10-year esti-
mated absolute risk of CKD among the 322 baseline PPI
users was 11.8% while the expected risk had they not used
PPIs was 8.5% (absolute risk difference, 3.3%).
A slightly stronger association was seen between PPI use
and AKI (Table 3). For example, in unadjusted analysis, par-
ticipants who used PPIs at baseline had 1.72 (95% CI, 1.28-
2.30; P < .001) times the risk of incident AKI relative to those
who did not report use. The corresponding risks were similar
after adjustment for potential confounders (HR, 1.64; 95% CI,
1.22-2.21; P < .001) and when PPI use was analyzed as a time-
varyingever-usevariable(HR,1.49;95%CI,1.25-1.77;P < .001).
Association Between PPI Use and Kidney Disease
in the Replication Cohort
In the replication cohort, there were 1921 incident CKD
events among 16 900 baseline PPI users (20.1 per 1000 per-
son-years) and 28 226 events among 231 851 baseline nonus-
ers (18.3 per 1000 person-years). Proton pump inhibitor use
was significantly associated with incident CKD in unad-
justed analyses (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.15-1.26; P < .001), in
adjusted analyses (adjusted HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.12-1.23;
P < .001), and when estimated using a time-varying ever-
use model (adjusted HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.19-1.25; P < .001)
(Table 2). Twice-daily PPI dosing (adjusted HR, 1.46; 95%
CI, 1.28-1.67; P < .001) was associated with a higher risk of
CKD than once-daily dosing (adjusted HR, 1.15; 95% CI,
1.09-1.21; P < .001). The 10-year absolute risk of CKD among
the 16 900 baseline PPI users was 15.6%, and the expected
risk had they not used PPIs was 13.9% (absolute risk
difference, 1.7%).
Similar associations were seen with incident AKI (Table 3).
Proton pump inhibitor use resulted in a higher risk of inci-
dent AKI in unadjusted analysis (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.21-1.40;

Sensitivity Analyses
When compared directly with H2 receptor antagonist use,
PPI use was associated with incident CKD in the ARIC study
(adjusted HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.01-1.91; P = .05) and in the rep-
lication cohort (adjusted HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.19-1.40;
P < .001). Baseline PPI use was also associated with incident
CKD in propensity score–matched analyses (HR, 1.76; 95%
CI, 1.13-2.74; P = .01 in the ARIC study and HR, 1.16; 95% CI,
1.09-1.24; P < .001 in the replication cohort) and in the new-
user analysis (adjusted HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.20-1.28;
P < .001). The use of H2 receptor antagonists was not associ-
ated with increased risk of incident CKD in either cohort
(adjusted HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.98-1.36; P = .10 in the ARIC

study and adjusted HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.88-0.99, P = .03 in
the replication cohort). Similar results were obtained when
persons with baseline albuminuria were excluded (adjusted
HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.09-1.96; P = .01 in the ARIC study and
adjusted HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.13-1.25; P < .001 in the replica-
tion cohort). Sensitivity analyses using AKI as an outcome
were also consistent (Table 3).
Discussion
In a prospective community-based cohort of more than 10 000
adults, we found that baseline use of PPIs was independently
associated with a 20% to 50% higher risk of incident CKD, af-
ter adjusting for several potential confounding variables, in-
cluding demographics, socioeconomic status, clinical mea-
surements, prevalent comorbidities, and concomitant use of
medications. The observed association persisted when PPI ex-
posure was modeled as a time-varying ever-use variable and
was replicated in a separate administrative cohort of 248 751
individuals. The risk was specific to PPI medications because
the use of H2 receptor antagonists, which are prescribed for the
sameindicationasPPIs,wasnotindependentlyassociatedwith
CKD. Similar findings were demonstrated for the outcome of
AKI and collectively suggest that PPI use is an independent risk
factor for CKD and for AKI.
Previous studies14-18 have also identified an association
between PPI use and AKI, most specifically in the form of
acute interstitial nephritis. Our study adds to the existing
literature by describing an association between PPI use and
incident CKD. We note that our study is observational and
does not provide evidence of causality. However, a causal
relationship between PPI use and CKD could have a consid-
erable public health effect given the widespread extent of
use. More than 15 million Americans used prescription PPIs
in 2013, costing more than $10 billion.29 Study findings sug-
gest that up to 70% of these prescriptions are without
indication6 and that 25% of long-term PPI users could dis-
continue therapy without developing symptoms.30 Indeed,
there are already calls for the reduction of unnecessary use
of PPIs.31
Observational cohort studies represent one of the best
methods to study adverse effects of medications used in
real-world settings. However, several limitations inherent in
observational design must be considered. First, unlike a
randomized clinical trial, participants who are prescribed
PPIs may be at a higher risk of CKD for reasons unrelated to
their PPI use. For example, PPI users in both the ARIC study
and the replication cohort were more likely to be obese,
have a diagnosis of hypertension, and carry a greater bur-
den of prescribed medications. In recognition of this poten-
tial bias, we performed adjustment for multiple confound-
ers, including BMI, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and
concomitant medication use, compared PPI users directly
with H2 receptor antagonist users, and conducted propen-
sity score–matched analyses. Each of these sensitivity

analyses showed a consistent association between PPI use
and a higher risk of CKD.
A second limitation of our study is the potential for sur-
veillance bias, whereby outcome assessment might have oc-
curred more often in persons using PPIs. In the ARIC study, in-
cidentCKDwasdetectedusinghospitalizationdischargecodes,
while outpatient creatinine levels were used in the replica-
tioncohort.However,theassociationbetweenPPIuseandnew
CKD persisted after accounting for predictors of more fre-
quent contact with the medical system such as insurance sta-
tus and comorbid illness. A third limitation is the low sensi-
tivity of hospital discharge codes for diagnosing CKD in the
ARIC study. However, the study results were replicated in the
Geisinger Health System cohort, in which CKD was defined by
direct laboratory measurements. Fourth, the inclusion of base-
line PPI users can invoke selection bias, whereby baseline us-
ersrepresentaspecialgroupofPPIuserswhotoleratethemedi-
cation without the development of CKD. In our study, there
were few prevalent PPI users at baseline, which should lead
to less bias.32 In addition, the results were replicated in a new-
user design in the replication cohort, in which baseline PPI us-
ers were excluded. A fifth potential limitation is that neither
PPI nor H2 receptor antagonist use was captured as directly ob-
served therapy. In recent years, both have become available
over the counter in the United States. Therefore, medication
exposureintheARICstudyandthereplicationcohortmayhave
been misclassified.
Notable strengths of the ARIC study include a large rep-
resentative community-based sample, baseline visits occur-
ring soon after PPIs were introduced into the United States, vi-
sual confirmation of medications used, comprehensive data
pertaining to potential confounders, and close monitoring for
more than 13 years of follow-up. Sensitivity analyses, includ-
ing a time-varying exposure model, propensity score match-
ing, and replication in a large second cohort, showed robust
results.WealsodemonstratedspecificitytoPPIuseratherthan
H2 receptor antagonist use.
Conclusions
In summary, we found that PPI use is an independent risk fac-
tor for CKD and AKI, but H2 antagonist use is not. Further re-
search is required to investigate whether PPI use itself causes
kidney damage and, if so, the underlying mechanisms of this
association.
