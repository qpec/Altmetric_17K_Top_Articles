Abstract
Objective
Valid, reliable, and clinically relevant outcome measures are necessary in clinical studies of
snake envenomation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric (validity and
reliability) and clinimetric (minimal clinically important difference [MCID]) properties of the
Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) in snakebite envenomation.
Methods
We performed a secondary analysis of two existing snakebite trials that measured clinical
outcomes using the PSFS as well as other quality of life and functional assessments. Data
were collected at 3, 7, 10, and 17 days. Reliability was determined using Cronbach’s alpha
for internal consistency and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for temporal stability
at 10 and 17 days. Validity was assessed using concurrent validity correlating with the other

 assessments. The MCID was evaluated using the following criteria: (1) the distribution of
stable patients according to both standard error of measurement (SEM) and responsive-
ness techniques, and (2) anchor-based methods to compare between individuals and to
detect discriminant ability of a positive change with a receiver operator characteristic (ROC)
curve and optimal cutoff point.
Results
A total of 86 patients were evaluated in this study. The average PSFS scores were 5.37 (SD
3.23), 7.95 (SD 2.22), and 9.12 (SD 1.37) at 3, 7, and 10 days, respectively. Negligible floor
effect was observed (maximum of 8% at 3 days); however, a ceiling effect was observed at
17 days (25%). The PSFS showed good reliability with an internal consistency of 0.91
(Cronbach’s alpha) (95% CI 0.88, 0.95) and a temporal stability of 0.83 (ICC) (95% CI 0.72,
0.89). The PSFS showed a strong positive correlation with quality of life and functional
assessments. The MCID was approximately 1.0 for all methods.
Conclusions
With an MCID of approximately 1 point, the PSFS is a valid and reliable tool to assess quality
of life and functionality in patients with snake envenomation.
Introduction
Snake envenomation is a common public health problem worldwide with annual estimates
ranging from 421,000 to 1,842,000 cases per year, with 20,000 to 94,000 deaths per year.[1–3]
The burden of disease is particularly pronounced in low- and middle-income countries, and
has been reclassified as a neglected tropical disease by the World Health Organization, leading
to further interest in the field.[2, 4, 5] Potential new therapies are being developed that will
require clinical trials.[6–9] However, the existing literature lacks data regarding patient-cen-
tered outcome measures for use in snake envenomation clinical trials.[10] Consequently, prior
trials have primarily used diagnosis-oriented endpoints, such as surrogate markers of coagulo-
pathy, as primary outcomes.[11–15] Outcome measures that are patient centered and ideally
patient reported will yield the most informative and clinically relevant information from the
clinical trials evaluating potential snake envenomation therapies.[16]
The Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) is a widely used patient-reported outcome
measure that identifies a short list of patient-chosen activities limited by the disease. The ability
to perform these activities is rated by the patient and can be followed over time through repeat
measurements.[17] This innovative approach has internal flexibility and measures only those
activities considered important to the individual. Although primarily used in musculoskeletal
disorders, this tool is not disease, organ system, or body part specific.[18–22] Additionally, the
PSFS has the advantage of brevity (3 to 5 items) and validation in multiple languages such as
English, Japanese, Finnish, Nepali and Portuguese.[23–26]
In 2012, a prospective observational study evaluated the number of potential outcome mea-
sures, including the PSFS, for assessing the recovery of limb function in snake envenomation.
[27] That study showed good correlation with other assessment tools and responsiveness to
change of the PSFS in snake envenomation, but further validity (such as construct, predictive
and criterion) and reliability (such as internal consistency and temporal stability) need yet to

 be evaluated. Specifically, the minimally clinically important difference (MCID) was not
assessed. The MCID indicates the minimal difference needed in a numeric scale that reflects a
patient perception of change in a given health status. Defining the MCID is a key component
in establishing the rigor of a patient-reported outcome intended to be used in patient-centered
studies such as clinical trials. In 2015, a double-blind randomized clinical trial of snake enven-
omation used the PSFS as the primary outcome.[28] Data from the patients enrolled in these
two studies are available to more fully assess the performance of the PSFS as an outcome mea-
sure of limb function recovery in snake envenomation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to
evaluate the psychometric (validity and reliability) and clinimetric (MCID) of the PSFS in a
snake envenomation population.
Materials and methods
Study design
We performed a post-hoc analysis of two multi-center, prospective studies conducted at 22
clinical sites across the southeastern United States (U.S.). The methods have been previously
described in detail and are summarized below.[27,28] The first study used a prospective obser-
vational design (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT 01651299). All treatment provided, including the deci-
sion to administer or not administer antivenom, was at the discretion of the treating
physician. The second study was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, and
all study treatments and assessments were performed in a blinded manner (Clinicaltrials.gov
NCT 01864200). The patients were randomized in a concealed fashion to receive Crotalidae
Polyvalent Immune Fab (Ovine) (CroFab) antivenom (FabAV) or placebo with the option of
open-label rescue therapy in either treatment arm at the investigator’s discretion. All patients
in both studies were enrolled in the emergency department, followed through their initial hos-
pital encounter, and returned for outpatient assessments 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after enven-
omation. Telephone assessments were performed between in-person assessments.
Participants
Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were adolescents (12 years of age or older) or
adults who were envenomated by a copperhead snake on an extremity, distal to the elbow or
knee. Copperhead species was determined by investigator evaluation of snake, snake carcass,
photographic of envenomating snake, captive snake, or patient identification of copperhead
from a standard array of snake photographs. Although clinical evidence of venom effect
(limb swelling and/or tenderness) was required, the venom effects did not need to be pro-
gressing at the time of enrollment. Patients must have presented for their initial episode of
care within 24 hours of envenomation. Prisoners and pregnant or breastfeeding women were
excluded. In addition, patients were excluded if they were unable to read and comprehend
the consent document or written assessment tools or if they had a distracting injury or other
condition that would limit the ability to make a reliable self-report of functionality status.
Additionally, patients who sustained a previous snake envenomation to any body area or a
previous injury to the envenomated limb within 30 days prior to enrollment were excluded.
In the parent studies, written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Additionally,
written parental assent was obtained for minors. Consent, assent, and assessment documents
were available in English and Spanish. Spanish language documents were translated from
English and back-translated from Spanish to ensure accuracy. The parent studies were
approved by the Western Institutional Review Board and the institutional review boards of
each institution [27,28].

 Instruments
Patient-Specific functional scale. The PSFS is a verbally administered three-item instru-
ment. It evaluates a health condition’s impact on the ability to perform activities chosen by the
patient. The patient is asked to identify “three important activities that you are unable to do or
are having difficulty with as a result of your snakebite.” The patient rates for each item on an
11-point ordinal scale ranging from 0 (“unable to perform activity”) to 10 (“able to perform
activity at the same level as before the injury or problem”). The patient re-rates the same three
activities at each follow-up assessment. In this manner, the PSFS collects patient-oriented out-
comes over time. An average of the three “important activity” scores was used for calculations.
This instrument was first administered on the day 3 assessment.
Patient’s Global impression of change.
The Patient’s Global Impression of Change
(PGIC) is widely used to define clinically meaningful improvement in orthopedic, pain, and
other studies. This instrument was first administered on day 3. This two-item assessment tool
uses separate ordinal scales to assess change “since beginning treatment at this clinic” [29]. The
first item was used for our analysis and is a 7-item Likert-type scale anchored at 1 (“no change
or condition has worsened”). We considered patients with a score of 4 or less as unchanged.
These PGIC responses range from “no change” to “somewhat better, but the change has not
made any real difference.” Patients with a PGIC score of 5 or greater were considered to have
perceived clinically important improvement. These responses range from “moderately better,
and a slight but noticeable change” to “a great deal better, and a considerable improvement
that has made all the difference.” This classification was used to determine patients’ perception
of clinically relevant change to be used as an anchor for the clinimetric analysis of the PSFS.
This approach has been used previously with the PSFS for other diseases.[30]
Functional assessments.
Four different, well-established, functional outcomes measures
were used to assess the external validity of the PSFS. We used the physical function element of
the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) version 2 and the Patient-Reported Outcomes
Measurement Information System Global-10 (PROMIS-10) to assess health-related quality of
life (QoL) and physical function.[31,32] We used the Lower Extremity Functional Scale
(LEFS) to measure lower extremity function.[33] We used the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoul-
der, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire to measure upper extremity function.[34] We correlated
these functional outcomes with the PSFS score, and considered a positive moderate association
as an indicator of good external validity. All functional assessments have shown good psycho-
metric properties in prior literature [33–39].
The SF-36 is a measurement tool composed of a 36-item self-administered questionnaire
with eight domain scales and two summary measures. Each item is an ordinal scale with 3–6
possible scores.[38, 40] We used the physical function domain for our analysis. The PROMIS-
10 consists of 10 items that assess general domains of health and functioning, including overall
physical health and overall quality of life. The LEFS questionnaire contains 20 questions about
a person’s ability to perform everyday tasks. The LEFS can be used to evaluate the functional
impairment of a patient with a disorder of one or both lower extremities. In addition, the LEFS
can be used to monitor the patient over time and evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention.
[33] The DASH is a 30-item self-administered questionnaire that evaluates upper extremity
function. Each item is reported on a 5-point ordinal scale (1–5).[41] The LEFS and the DASH
were correlated with the PSFS in patients with an upper or lower extremity injury.
Data collection
Following screening and enrollment, each subject provided demographic information, past
medical and medication history, and history of envenomation. In addition, a complete physical

 examination was performed. Data about the initial hospital encounter, including the date and
time of arrival, the maximal extent of swelling, medication administration, laboratory test results,
and adverse events, were recorded by study personnel at the time of care. Missing information
was obtained from the hospital record. Formal study assessments were performed prior to dis-
charge from the initial ED/hospital encounter and at 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after envenomation.
Analysis
Participant characteristics and the PSFS floor and ceiling effect are represented using descrip-
tive statistics with frequency distribution, means, and standard deviations (SDs) when applica-
ble. All analyses were conducted using the R Software for Statistical Computing program.
Psychometric property evaluation.
We evaluated the reliability and external validity of
the PSFS. Reliability was determined by assessing the internal consistency and temporal stabil-
ity of the PSFS. Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha, with coefficients
above 0.7 considered acceptable.[39] We assessed temporal stability using intraclass correla-
tion (ICC) to determine the instrument’s variation in time.
External validity was assessed using the Spearman correlation of the PSFS measure with the
SF-36 Health Outcomes Scale, the DASH, and the LEFS. A positive correlation (R > 0.60) was
considered an indicator of external validity. Additionally, the change in the PSFS was corre-
lated with the PGIC as an indicator of external validity. Higher variations in the PSFS were
expected to correlate with higher scores of the PGIC.
Clinimetric property evaluation.
To more definitively determine the MCID of the PSFS
specifically for snake envenomation, we used two distribution-based methods and two anchor-
based methods. For the first distribution-based method, the MCID was defined as the amount
of variation in the PSFS score that must be observed before the change can be considered to
exceed the standard error of measurement (SEM). The SEM was calculated using the formula
(SD [1-r]1/2) where r is the ICC coefficient and the SD is the square root of the total variance.
The SEM was multiplied by 1.65 to determine the 90% confidence interval (CI).[42] This value
was multiplied by the square root of 2 to account for the errors introduced with repeated mea-
surements.[43] For the second distribution-based method, the MCID was defined as the pooled
SD of the difference between baseline and follow-up time multiplied by 0.5. This value corre-
sponded to the amount of variation expected to identify a change in the PSFS score.[38] For the
first anchor-based method, the MCID was defined as the smallest difference in the PSFS score
that could predict the patients’ subjective perception of change.[44] This method calculated the
MCID by identifying the optimal cut-off point (Youden’s Index) on the receiver operator char-
acteristic (ROC) curve, which is considered to be the best discriminant value to distinguish
improved from unchanged patients as defined by the PGIC.[42] Diagnostic performance (sensi-
tivity, specificity, and area under the curve [AUC]) of the selected cut-off score were reported.
For the second anchor-based method, the MCID was defined as the average of the difference in
the PSFS between baseline and follow-up for the patients who reported subjective perception of
improvement versus the patients who did not. [38] Once the MCID of the PSFS in snake enven-
omation was determined by the methods above, we externally validated the MCID by assessing
the correlation of this value with measures of general health and functioning. Specifically, we
compared the PROMIS-10, LEFS, DASH and SF-36 physical function at day 7 and 14 between
patients with a change in PSFS of � the MICD and < the MCID value.
Results
Our sample was composed of 86 patients. The average age was 43.0 (SD 17.6) years, and the
participants were mostly white (87%). Slightly more male patients (52%) participated in the

 study. Eight patients (9%) were adolescents. Most patients had lower extremity injuries (62%).
When completing the PSFS, the main activities chosen by the participants were activities of
daily living (e.g., carrying items, climbing stairs, providing self-care), sports and exercise (e.g.,
running, swimming, collective sports), and specific body movements (e.g., flexing the affected
hand, moving a finger). Work-related activities represented only 11% of all activities chosen.
(Table 1)
Psychometric properties
The average PSFS score increased at each follow-up assessment. Negligible floor effect was
observed (max of 8% at 3 days). However, a ceiling effect was observed after 7 days of treat-
ment (Table 2). The reliability of the PSFS was adequate with good internal consistency (a
Cronbach’s alpha of 0.91; 95% CI 0.88, 0.95) and good temporal stability (ICC value for the
unchanged patients of 0.83; 95% CI 0.72, 0.89) (Table 2). External validity was demonstrated
with a strong correlation of the PSFS scores with the SF-36 Physical Function scores, the PRO-
MIS-10, and extremity functional assessments (Table 3).
Clinimetric properties
The two distribution-based methods yielded similar results. The MCID calculated using the
SEM of the individual scale responses was 1.04. When using the pooled SD of the differences
between the scale responses at baseline and follow-up, the MCID was 1.05.
The anchor-based methods showed similar MCID thresholds. At 3 days of follow-up, 39
(45%) patients were considered to have remained “unchanged” (scores of 4 or below on the
PGIC), whereas 46 (53%) patients were considered to have improved (scores of 5 or greater on
the PGIC). The optimal PSFS cut-off point to distinguish between unchanged and improved
patients showed an MCID of 1.0 (Sensitivity = 0.60; 95% CI 0.52, 0.71, Specificity = 0.83; 95%
CI 0.73, 0.89, AUC = 0.70; 95% CI 0.61, 0.73). Similarly, comparing the PSFS difference in
unchanged versus improved patients on day 3 until day 14 showed an MCID of 0.98 as the

nal validity of the PSFS MCID of 1.0, significantly higher scores in the SF-36 Physical Func-
tioning, PROMIS-10 and LEFS were observed between participants with a PSFS change above
and below 1.0 (Table 5).
Discussion
The PSFS has been widely used with other clinical populations; however, to date, no previous
study has evaluated the reliability, temporal stability, and MCID of the PSFS in patients with
snake envenomation. Our results demonstrate that the PSFS is reliable, stable over time, exter-
nally valid, and strongly correlated with extremity functional assessment and other indicators
of quality of life. The MCID was approximately 1.0 using multiple methodologies. This finding
is important because the PSFS has been increasingly used as a patient-reported outcome mea-
sure due to its internal flexibility of content and ease of use.[45] These results inform the clini-
cal significance of prior clinical trials and further refine a potential outcome measure for
future snake envenomation studies.
The internal consistency of the PSFS in our study was excellent. This result is similar to the
findings of studies performed in knee dysfunction, acute and chronic low back pain, cervical
pain, chronic lateral epicondylitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These
studies found test-retest values ranging from 0.55–0.95.[18, 19, 46] In addition, the PSFS dem-
onstrated stability over time, and these findings are similar to those in the existing literature,
which show that the PSFS is consistent when measured at different times.[18] Additionally,
our results show strong external validity when compared with other functional and quality of
life instruments (SF-36, PROMIS-10, LEFS, and DASH) and prior studies.[22, 23, 47]
The PSFS has responsiveness and clinical relevance for patients in other disease groups.[18,
48] In addition, the PSFS has shown good reliability across items and time for the same groups
of diseases and good between-group discrimination ability.[49] Other potential outcome

 measures of recovery of limb function from snake envenomation have not had this degree of
evaluation, take more time to perform, and have other significant limitations. Other tools,
such as the DASH and the LEFS, are limited by use in either the upper or lower extremity
only, leaving a large proportion of snakebites unevaluable by a single tool.[33, 41] The mea-
surement of swelling as an outcome measure does not demonstrate inter- and intrarater reli-
ability, is not responsive to change during recovery, and lacks the advantages of a patient-
reported outcome because this assessment does not measure recovery of function.[27, 50]
Because of the limitations of other outcome measures, the strengths of the PSFS render it an
excellent tool to assess the impact of venom-induced tissue injury in patients by measuring the
meaningful outcome of recovery of function.
The MCID of the PSFS for a snakebite population was determined to be approximately 1
point. This finding was consistent across multiple distribution- and anchor-based methods.
Moreover, we performed an external validation of an MCID of 1.0 with measures of general
health and functioning. In this analysis, a change in PSFS of � 1.0 (MCID) correlated with sta-
tistically significant higher PROMIS-10, SF-36 physical function, and LEFS scores compared
to a change <1.0. The lack of association with the DASH may be related to its responsiveness,
which has not been fully evaluated in snakebite. Although the MCID in chronic and spinal dis-
eases has been found to be higher, similar values were found in other acute diseases involving
the extremities.[19] This result provides additional assurance that an MCID of 1 point can
used. When assessing the ability of the PSFS to determine the patient’s global impression of
change, we found that an optimal MCID cut-off point of 1.0 on the ROC was highly specific
(81%) for detecting the patient’s perception of change. However, the AUC was only 7.0 due to
limited sensitivity in detecting change. Although a difference of 1 point in the PSFS indicated a
clinically significant change between the groups, a lower PSFS value may lack the sensitivity in
detecting an important difference between two groups even when one exists, which creates a
risk of beta error when using this outcome measure. In future clinical trials, investigators may
consider augmenting the PSFS with additional outcomes to provide further insight if a differ-
ence of less than 1.0 in the PSFS is found.
Limitations
The results of this study should be taken within the context of the study’s limitations. The
majority of the participants in this study were patients with mild copperhead envenomation.

 Because this type of envenomation is typically less severe than other snake envenomations,
generalization to other pit viper species or to non—pit viper species should be performed care-
fully. In our study, no floor effects of the PSFS were detected, but this could potentially change
in a more severely envenomed population. However, the PSFS has now been evaluated across
a large spectrum of other non-envenomation disease states with similar findings, which should
provide reassurance that this tool remains valid and reliable in snake envenomation cases that
are more severe or from other species.
Because patients were undergoing emergent therapy for their snake envenomation upon
enrollment, we were not able to determine the PSFS upon ED arrival or use that early time
point in our analysis. The greatest improvement in the PSFS scores occurred during the early
phase of recovery; therefore, a lack of data upon arrival likely resulted in an overestimation of
the MCID in this study, indicating that the true MCID may be lower than we found. However,
because our estimate is similar to other studies of extremity injuries, we suggest that an MCID
of 1 point is a reasonable estimate.
Our evaluation of the PSFS is for recovery of limb function due to the tissue injury from the
snake venom. Severe snake envenomation involves multiple organ systems or venom effect
domains, which are not evaluated by the PSFS.[51] To fully assess outcomes in future snake
envenomation clinical trials, the psychometric and clinimetric properties of other patient-ori-
ented and/or patient-reported outcome measures for these clinical effects should be
determined.
The PSFS functional activities chosen by each patient vary, which does not allow standard
psychometric and clinimetric methods to be applied on the level of an individual activity. All
of our analysis was performed on the aggregated PSFS score. The theoretical underpinning of
this approach is that the PSFS is evaluating perception of functional impact by the snakebite
regardless of the activity. This approach is consistent with the accepted evaluation of the PSFS
in prior literature. [18–24]
Conclusion
The PSFS is a valid, reliable tool in snake envenomation with good internal consistency, tem-
poral stability, external validity, and correlation with other assessment tools, and this instru-
ment is responsive to change. The PSFS should be considered an outcome measure of recovery
of limb function due to tissue injury in future snake envenomation trials with an MCID of
approximately 1 point.
