ABSTRACT
Background The significance of periconceptional nutrition for optimizing offspring and
maternal health and reducing social inequalities warrants greater understanding of diet
quality among US women.
Objective Our objective was to evaluate racial or ethnic and education inequalities in
periconceptional diet quality and sources of energy and micronutrients.
Design Cross-sectional analysis of data from the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes
Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-Be cohort.
Participants and setting Nulliparous women (N¼7,511) were enrolled across eight US
medical centers from 2010 to 2013.
Main outcome measures A semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire assessing
usual dietary intake during the 3 months around conception was self-administered
during the first trimester. Diet quality, measured using the Healthy Eating Index-2010
(HEI-2010), and sources of energy and micronutrients were the outcomes.
Statistical analyses Differences in diet quality were tested across maternal racial or
ethnic and education groups using F tests associated with analysis of variance and c2
tests.
Results HEI-2010 score increased with higher education, but the increase among non-
Hispanic black women was smaller than among non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics
(interaction P value <0.0001). For all groups, average scores for HEI-2010 components
were below recommendations. Top sources of energy were sugar-sweetened beverages,
pasta dishes, and grain desserts, but sources varied by race or ethnicity and education.
Approximately 34% of energy consumed was from empty calories (the sum of energy
from added sugars, solid fats, and alcohol beyond moderate levels). The primary sources
of iron, folate, and vitamin C were juices and enriched breads.
Conclusions Diet quality is suboptimal around conception, particularly among women
who are non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, or who had less than a college degree. Diet
quality could be improved by substituting intakes of refined grains and foods empty in
calories with vegetables, peas and beans (legumes), seafood, and whole grains.

ATERNAL NUTRITIONAL STATUS HAS A POWER-
ful influence on the offspring’s health and sus-
ceptibility to disease later in life. Observational
and experimental studies demonstrate that in-
utero exposure to under- or overnutrition is associated with
poor health outcomes in adulthood, including metabolic
disease, obesity, cancer, and osteoporosis.1,2 Suboptimal
nutrition may have a critical influence during the peri-
conceptional period, when fetal growth trajectory, placental
capacity to supply nutrients to the fetus, fetoplacental
immunology and inflammation, and maternal hormonal
and
metabolic
regulatory systems
are
established.3,4
A
poor-quality diet during the periconceptional period may
also threaten maternal health
by promoting obesity,5,6
excessive gestational weight gain,7 and postpartum weight
retention.8
Little is known about the quality of periconceptional
dietary intakes in the United States because too few pregnant
women are included in national nutrition surveys. Diet
quality of nonpregnant adults in the United States is generally
poor,9,10 but some data indicate that diet improves when
women are planning a pregnancy11 or once they become
pregnant.12-14 There is a striking disparity in diet quality by
socioeconomic position and race or ethnicity in the United

 States that has grown over time.9 Understanding whether
these trends apply to pregnant women is critical because
poor diet is modifiable and associated with the long-standing
inequalities in maternal and child health outcomes.15
The significance of maternal nutrition for optimizing
offspring health, reducing maternal obesity, and lessening
social inequalities demands a greater understanding of diet
quality among US pregnant women. Identifying the aspects of
diet that conform to national recommendations and where
diets fall short is necessary for targeting prevention efforts.
Further, increasing our knowledge of pregnant women’s
major dietary sources of energy and nutrients provides an
important
context
for
dietary guidance.
Therefore,
the
objective of the present study was to evaluate racial or ethnic
and education inequalities in periconceptional diet quality of
a large and geographically diverse contemporary cohort of US
pregnant women.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring
Mothers-to-Be is a prospective cohort study designed to
evaluate maternal and environmental contributors to poor
birth outcomes (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01322529).16
Women who were <14 weeks’ gestation in their first preg-
nancy were enrolled at eight US medical centers (Case
Western Reserve University, Columbia University, Indiana
University, University of Pittsburgh, Northwestern University,
University of California at Irvine, University of Pennsylvania,
and the University of Utah) from October 2010 to September
2013. Data were managed by the Data Coordinating and
Analysis Center at RTI International. Eligible women were
those who had no previous delivery at 20 weeks’ gestation or
later, a viable singleton pregnancy with estimated gestational
age from 6 weeks 0 days to 13 weeks 6 days, and intention to
deliver at a participating clinical site hospital. Criteria for
ineligibility included age <13 years, history of three or more
pregnancy losses, donor oocyte pregnancy, planned preg-
nancy termination, malformations likely to be lethal and
aneuploidies known at enrollment, previous enrollment, and
inability to provide informed consent. Each site’s local insti-
tutional review board approved the study before initiation
and all women gave written, informed consent.
The Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring
Mothers-to-Be protocol has been described in detail previ-
ously.16 Briefly, women participated in three study visits
during pregnancy and one at delivery. At the first study visit
(completed 6 to 13 weeks’ gestation), trained and creden-
tialed study personnel administered structured question-
naires to ascertain data on demographic characteristics,
medical history, behaviors, and psychosocial factors, obtained
clinical measurements and biospecimens, and abstracted
data from ultrasound reports conducted by certified sonog-
raphers. In addition, a food frequency questionnaire inquiring
about
usual
periconceptional
dietary
intake
was
self-
administered.
A total of 10,038 women agreed to participate, and of those,
8,259 (82%) had complete dietary data available. This article’s
interest was in racial or ethnic and education inequalities in
diet quality, so four women with missing data on these var-
iables and 744 women who self-identified as a racial or ethnic
group other than non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, or
Hispanic were excluded due to relatively small numbers
within any individual group. The final analytic sample was
7,511 women.
Women self-reported their highest level of education,
which was categorized as high school or less (less than high
school or high school graduate or GED completed), some
college (some college credit, but no degree, or associate/
technical degree), college graduate (bachelor’s degree), or
graduate degree (master’s, doctorate, or professional degree).
Self-reported race or ethnicity was classified as non-Hispanic
white, non-Hispanic black, or Hispanic. Other information
self-reported at the first visit included marital status, smok-
ing before pregnancy, gravidity, and medical insurance.
Self-reported gross income and size of the household were
classified relative to the 2013 federal poverty levels for the 48
contiguous states and the District of Columbia17 as <130%
(the income eligibility guidelines for participation in the
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program18), 130% to 349%,
or �350%. At the initial visit, women wearing only light
clothes and no shoes had their weight measured using an
electronic or balance scale and height measured using a
stadiometer or measuring tape. Early pregnancy body mass
index (visit 1 weight [in kilograms]/height (in meters2]) was
categorized as underweight (<18.5), normal weight (18.5 to
24.9), overweight (25 to 29.9), obese (30 to 34.9), or severely
obese (�35).19
Dietary Data
Usual dietary intake during the 3 months around conception
was assessed at the first study visit using a self-administered
modified Block 2005 food frequency questionnaire (FFQ),
which was available in English and Spanish. The instrument
assesses 52 nutrients and 35 food groups from approximately
120 food and beverage items. The FFQ’s food list was devel-
oped from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey 1999-2002 dietary recall data,20 and the nutrient
database was developed from the US Department of Agri-
culture Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies
version 1. Food groups were derived from the MyPyramid
Equivalents Database, version 2.0. The questionnaire uses a
series of adjustment questions to improve the estimation of
fat and carbohydrate intake. Portion size is asked for each
food, and pictures are given to enhance accuracy. The in-
strument has been validated in many populations, including
pregnant women.21-26 The questionnaire was slightly modi-
fied to reflect a 3-month period and to include more sources
of marine n-3 fatty acids.
Participants completed the FFQ on a paper form during the
first study visit. For easier recall of the 3 months around
conception, a trained study staff member labeled each
woman’s FFQ with the months of interest. Study personnel
checked all pages of the FFQ for completeness. Completed
questionnaires were sent to Block Dietary Data Systems for
optical scanning and nutrient analysis using software devel-
oped at the National Cancer Institute.27
Adherence to the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans
was measured using the Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI-
2010).10,28 The HEI-2010 assesses 12 key aspects of diet
quality. Nine components measure adequacy of intake: Total

 Fruit; Whole Fruit (forms other than juice); Total Vegetables;
Greens and Beans (dark-green vegetables and beans and
peas); Whole Grains; Dairy (all milk products and soy bev-
erages); Total Protein Foods; Seafood and Plant Proteins; and
Fatty Acids (ratio of poly- and monounsaturated fat to satu-
rated fat). Three components measure moderation of intake:
Refined Grains, Sodium, and Empty Calories (all calories from
solid fats and added sugars plus calories from alcohol beyond
a moderate level). Scores for each component increase as
intake reaches the recommended standard (higher intakes
for the adequacy components and lower intakes of the
moderation components). Usual intakes of the 12 compo-
nents were expressed relative to energy before calculating
component and total scores. Although there are many
accepted measures of diet quality, including the alternate
Mediterranean diet and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hyper-
tension scores,29,30 the HEI-2010 was used because it reflects
adherence to the national Dietary Guidelines.10,28 F tests
associated with analysis of variance models were used to test
for differences in mean HEI-2010 and component scores by
race or ethnicity, education, and the interaction between race
or ethnicity and education. Linear trends in HEI-2010 with
increasing level of education were evaluated in one-way
analysis of variance using contrasts for linear trend in the
parameter estimates, computed with orthogonal polynomial
coefficients. The c2 test was used to assess for differences by
race or ethnicity in the percentage of women adhering to
recommended standards on HEI-2010 components. The c2
test was used to assess for differences in the distribution of
HEI-2010 scores across overall quintiles by race or ethnicity
and by education. A P value <0.05 indicated statistical
significance.
The major dietary sources of energy, energy from added
sugars, energy from solid fats, and seven nutrients of public
health importance were determined by estimating the
amount provided by each FFQ item. The population mean
nutrient intake for each food or beverage was divided by the
population mean total nutrient intake to calculate the per-
centage contribution of total intake.31 FFQ line items were
grouped into 79 mutually exclusive food groups for analysis
that are shown in Figure 1 (available online at www.
jandonline.org).
RESULTS
Non-Hispanic white women made up 69% of the cohort,
whereas 18% were Hispanic and 13% were non-Hispanic
black. More than half of the sample had either a college or
graduate degree (54%), and only 18% had a high school edu-
cation or less. Most of the cohort did not smoke, was married,
of normal weight in early pregnancy, and had a household
income at 350% or more of the federal poverty level (Table 1).
HEI-2010 Scores
The mean�standard deviation HEI-2010 score of the sample
was 63�13 out of 100 possible points. Non-Hispanic white
women had the highest mean HEI-2010 scores, followed by
Hispanic women and then non-Hispanic black women
(Table 2). More non-Hispanic white women (24%) had
HEI-2010 scores that fell into the highest quintile of the
distribution (median score¼79) compared with Hispanic
(14%) and non-Hispanic black women (4.6%). Almost half of

 increase from the lowest to the highest levels of education)
and the least change among Hispanics (12-point increase). At
all levels of education, non-Hispanic black mothers had the
lowest mean HEI-2010 scores. Results were similar when
levels of income or type of insurance as a marker of socio-
economic position were used (data not shown).
HEI-2010 Component Scores
Each component that made up the HEI-2010 had a mean
score below the recommendation for the sample overall and
for each racial or ethnic group (Table 3). Overall, only about
half of women met the recommended standard for Total
Fruit, Whole Fruit, Greens and Beans, and Total Protein Foods
categories. Fewer than 10% of women met the dietary
guideline for Whole Grains, Fatty Acids, Sodium, and Empty
Calories categories. Nearly all differences in component
scores were significantly different by race or ethnicity. Non-
Hispanic black women tended to have the lowest mean
component scores. For nine of 12 components, non-Hispanic
white mothers had the highest mean scores.
As maternal education level increased, there were signifi-
cant improvements toward meeting recommendations for all
adequacy components (seven of nine components shown in
panel A of Figure 2) and moderation components except
Sodium (panel B of Figure 2). Meaningful differences, defined
as at least a 15-percentege point change from lowest to
highest, were observed for all components except Dairy, Total
Protein Foods, Refined Grains, and Sodium.
Dietary Sources of Energy
The top sources of energy (see Table 4) were soda; pasta
dishes; grain desserts (eg, cookies, cakes); refined bread; and
beer, wine, and spirits. Soda was the primary contributor to
energy intake among women who were non-Hispanic black,
Hispanic, high-school educated, and those completing some
college. Women with a college or graduate degree consumed
more energy from beer, wine, and spirits than any other
source.
Intake of solid fat contributed an average of 18% of daily
energy intake. Cheese, eggs and egg-mixed dishes, and pizza
were the top sources of solid fats in the cohort. Primary
sources of solid fat differed for non-Hispanic black women
and women with a high school education or less, in whom
fatty meat and grain desserts were the top-2 contributors.
The mean daily intake from added sugars was 14% of total
energy. By far, the greatest contributor to added sugar intake
was soda, sports drinks, and energy drinks. All sugar-
sweetened beverages (soda and fruit drinks) contributed
48% to 56% of added sugars among women who were non-
Hispanic black, Hispanic, or who had less than a college
degree, and 22% to 35% among non-Hispanic white women
and women with a college or graduate degree. Grain desserts

 and candy were other important sources of added sugar for
all groups.
Empty calories (the sum of energy from solid fats, added
sugars, and alcohol beyond moderate levels) represented 34%
of energy consumed. The recommended allowance of empty
calories is 9% to 13% of total energy.32
Dietary Sources of Nutrients
The primary sources of iron were ready-to-eat cereals, yeast
bread, pasta dishes, grain desserts, and pizza (Table 5). Green
salad was the only vegetable in the top 10 sources of iron.
Green salad and ready-to-eat cereals were the top-two
sources of folate for all groups except for non-Hispanic
black women, whose second highest folate intake came
from 100% orange or grapefruit juice. Yeast bread, pasta, meal
replacement (eg, SlimFast [Kainos Capital]), and rice were
other primary sources of folate.
Reduced-fat milk and cheese were the top foods contrib-
uting to calcium intake. Skim milk was a top 5 contributor
only among non-Hispanic white women and women with at
least a college degree, whereas whole milk was a top source
of calcium for Hispanic women and women with a high-
school education or less. One hundred percent orange or
grapefruit juice was a primary source of vitamin C intake
among all groups. Juices and sugar-sweetened beverages
combined for a much larger proportion of vitamin C intake
(47% to 60%) than solid fruits or vegetables (27% to 36%) for
non-Hispanic black and Hispanic women and women with
some college or less (some foods not shown in Table 4). The
opposite was true for non-Hispanic white women or women
who had at least a college degree (52% to 59% vitamin C from
solid fruits or vegetables and 24% to 30% from juices and
sugar-sweetened beverages; data not shown). Dietary sour-
ces of protein, carbohydrate, and total fat appear in Table 6
(available online at www.jandonline.org).
DISCUSSION
Periconceptional diet quality in this US cohort of women in
their first pregnancy is suboptimal. Scores for none of the 12
components of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans met
current recommendations. Consumption of whole grains,
dairy products, and fatty acids were especially low, whereas
empty calories and sodium intakes were too high. The foods
that contributed most to energy intake were low in nutrients
and rich in added sugars and solid fats, whereas primary
sources of iron, folate, and vitamin C were juices and
enriched breads. The gaps in adherence to dietary guidance
by maternal race or ethnicity and education were pro-
nounced. Compared with women who had at least a college
degree and non-Hispanic white women, women who were
non-Hispanic
black,
Hispanic,
or
not college graduates
consistently reported a diet that was lower in quality. Their
intakes of sugary drinks—which provide minimal nutritional
value—contributed substantially to energy intake, whereas
nutrient-dense foods (ie, beans, nuts and seeds, seafood,
fruits, and vegetables) were consumed too infrequently to be
an important source of micronutrient intakes.
The authors are not aware of other studies that have
evaluated periconceptional adherence to national dietary
guidance in a large, geographically diverse cohort of US
pregnant women. Nevertheless, our findings—including the
notable socioeconomic inequalities in diet quality—mirror
national population trends.32-35 The diet quality gap among
nonpregnant individuals is thought to be a consequence of
many factors, including the access to and price of healthy
foods, knowledge of a healthful diet, and pressing needs that
may take priority over a healthful diet.36 Supplemental
Nutrition Assistance Program was designed to reduce the
socioeconomic gap in diet quality, but it is not clear whether
it has been effective.37,38 In contrast, the Special Supple-
mental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children
(WIC) aligned its food packages with national guidance in
2007. Since then, diet quality and birth outcomes have
meaningfully improved among participants.39 During the
periconceptional period, however, most women do not know
they are pregnant and have not enrolled in WIC. Data in our
cohort were lacking to determine whether the observed gaps
in diet quality narrow after WIC enrollment.
Poor periconceptional diet quality and the racial or ethnic
and socioeconomic inequalities in adherence to dietary
guidance have considerable implications for maternal and
child well-being. Healthy diet patterns have been linked to
reduced risks of racially or ethnically disparate health out-
comes, including preterm birth,40 fetal growth restriction,41

 preeclampsia,42 maternal obesity,5,6 and postpartum weight
retention,8 although causality of these relations remains un-
certain. Unlike many other risk factors that vary by socio-
economic position, dietary intake is modifiable. Future work
is needed to quantify the degree to which diet quality may
explain inequalities in adverse birth outcomes.
Estimates of usual dietary intake are likely imperfect.43,44
Systematic misreporting of diet, which is known to occur
for individuals who are obese,45 may differentially affect
estimates of intake among low socioeconomic groups. How-
ever, self-reported dietary data, including those from FFQs,
have been successful in informing dietary guidance and
public health policy.44 The HEI-2010 weights all dietary
components equally, but it is possible that some components
may be more influential on health outcomes than others.
Further, a deficiency of one nutrient may have a broader
influence even in cases where overall diet quality is high.
Unfortunately, the study lacked repeated measures of dietary
intake during pregnancy to evaluate trends in adherence to
dietary guidance during gestation. There were too few
women in other racial or ethnic groups (eg, n¼348 Asian
women) for precise analysis. These results may generalize
only to nulliparas receiving care at large medical centers.
Whereas this was not a nationally representative sample, this
contemporary cohort is the most geographically and racially
or ethnically diverse cohort of US pregnant women with
dietary data of which the authors are aware.
Although attention should be given to finding ways of
improving nutrition counseling in clinical settings, individual
behavior change may be less effective and efficient at
improving diet than systems-level changes.46 Therefore,
structural
interventions
that
promote
an
environment
conducive to making healthy dietary choices should be
considered. Such collective actions may be more likely to
influence low socioeconomic populations, thereby reducing
health disparities and improving health outcomes for women
and their children.
CONCLUSIONS
Major gains can be made in diet quality of pregnant women
by substituting dietary intakes of refined grains and foods
empty in calories with vegetables, peas and beans (legumes),
seafood, and whole grains; reducing sugary beverage con-
sumption; and lowering sodium intakes. Future research
should establish whether improvements in periconceptional
diet quality lead to better pregnancy and birth outcomes.
