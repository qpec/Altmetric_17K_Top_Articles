Abstract 
26 
Aim: To evaluate an additional rapid-acting insulin bolus on postprandial lipaemia, 
27 
inflammation, and pro-coagulation following high-carbohydrate high-fat feeding in people 
28 
with type 1 diabetes.  
29 
Methods: Ten males with type 1 diabetes (HbA1c 52.55.9 mmol/mol [7.00.5%]) underwent 
30 
three conditions: 1) a low-fat meal with normal bolus insulin (LF), 2), a high-fat meal with 
31 
normal bolus insulin (HF), 3) a high-fat meal with normal bolus insulin with an additional 30% 
32 
insulin bolus administered 3-hrs post-meal (HFA). Meals had identical carbohydrate and 
33 
protein content and bolus insulin dose determined by carbohydrate-counting. Blood was 
34 
sampled periodically for 6-hr post-meal and analysed for TG, NEFA, APOB48, glucagon, TNF-
35 
�, fibrinogen, HTF activity, and PAI-1. Continuous glucose monitoring captured interstitial 
36 
glucose responses. 
37 
Results: TG concentrations following LF remained similar to baseline, whereas TG levels 
38 
following HF were significantly greater throughout the 6-hour observation period. The 
39 
additional insulin bolus (HFA) normalised TG similarly to LF 3-6-hrs following the meal.  HF 
40 
was associated with late postprandial elevations in TNF-�, whereas LF and HFA was not. 
41 
Fibrinogen, PAI-1, and TFP levels were similar between conditions.  
42 
Conclusions: Additional bolus insulin 3-hrs following a high-carbohydrate high-fat meal 
43 
prevents late rises in postprandial TGs and TNF-�, thus improving cardiovascular risk profile.

Introduction 
50 
Structured education provided to patients with type 1 diabetes for managing meal-time insulin 
51 
dose focuses on the carbohdyrate-counting method 1, 2, whereby people calculate the dose of 
52 
insulin administered at meal-times based on the total carbohdyrate content of that meal 3. 
53 
Whilst this has been demonstrated as an effective strategy for HbA1c reduction 3, typical eating 
54 
patterns consist of the consumption of mixed-macronutrient meals 4, and in reality many people 
55 
with type 1 diabetes still struggle to maintain postprandial euglycaemia 5. This is particularly 
56 
the case for individuals treated with modern insulin analogue injections, as this method of 
57 
insulin delivery is associated with less meal-time insulin dose flexibility compared to 
58 
Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion therapy (CSII) 6. 
59 
 
60 
The addition of fat to a carbohydrate-based meal has been shown to cause postprandial 
61 
hyperglycaemia, and increase insulin requirements late into the postprandial period 7, 8. In 
62 
clinical practice, people with type 1 diabetes are often reluctant to administer an additional 
63 
injection of bolus insulin either at mealtime or late into the postprandial period for fear of 
64 
hypoglycaemia or because increasing injection frequency is considered to be burdensome 6, 9. 
65 
Recently, we have showed that when consuming a carbohydrate-based meal with a high-fat 
66 
content, adopting the carbohydrate-counting method for insulin dose adjustments at meal-time 
67 
followed by the administration of an additional insulin-bolus late into the postprandial period 
68 
is important for the normalisation of glycaemia 7. Specifically, compared to the carbohydrate-
69 
counting method alone, administration of additional bolus insulin 3 hours later resulted in a 
70 
23% reduction in blood glucose area under the curve (AUC) 7. Importantly, this method did 
71 
not cause hypoglycaemia, whereas simply increasing the amount of rapid-acting insulin dose 
72 
administered at meal-time did 7.  
73 
 
74 
 Original Article 
Insulin has an important role not only in the control of postprandial glucose excursions, but 
75 
also in the regulation of postprandial lipaemia 10.  Excessive increases in both glycaemia and 
76 
lipaemia can create a pro- inflammatory and -coagulant milieu 11-15, and are collectively and 
77 
independently associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and early mortality 16, 17. 
78 
Considering the substantial pre-existing risk of CVD-associated early mortality in this cohort 
79 
18, 19, and the potential for this to be heightened by exaggerated post-prandial lipaemia 20-24, 
80 
optimising meal time insulin dosage is important for cardiovascular risk management, not just 
81 
normalisation of glycaemia per se. However, the influence of administering additional insulin 
82 
late into the postprandial period on metabolic or cardiovascular risk factors in patients with 
83 
type 1 diabetes treated with basal-bolus injection therapy has never been assessed. In this study, 
84 
we manipulated rapid-acting insulin injection dosage and timing in response to a high-
85 
carbohydrate high-fat meal feeding to test the hypothesis that an additional but delayed rapid-
86 
acting insulin bolus is required to normalise postprandial lipaemia and the associated 
87 
metabolic, inflammatory, and pro-coagulant response. 
88 
 
89 
Methods 
90 
Patients 
91 
The study population consisted of 10 male type 1 diabetes patients (mean ± SD; age 26  4 
92 
years, BMI 25.4  1.6 kg.m2, duration of diabetes 17  5 years, age at diagnosis 9  4 years; 
93 
HbA1c 52.5  5.9 mmol/mol [7.0  0.5 %]). Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were 
94 
aged between 18-50 years, with a duration of diabetes greater than 5 years on enrolment, treated 
95 
on basal-bolus insulin regimen, and were familiar with carbohydrate counting and using a 
96 
stable insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio. Patients were treated on a stable basal-bolus insulin 
97 
analogue regimen consisting of either insulin glargine (n = 8) or detemir (n = 2) and fast-acting 
98 
insulin analogue aspart (n = 10), for a minimum of 12 months. Patients were free of diabetes 
99 
 Original Article 
related complications, and were receiving no additional medication other than insulin. All 
100 
patients had received structured education in carbohydrate counting as part of their diabetes 
101 
care. This study received approval by the local National Health Service Research Ethics 
102 
Committee (R&D Ref: 7241). All patients who participated provided written informed consent. 
103 
Eligible patients underwent randomization by computer program to determine the sequence of 
104 
3 crossover conditions.  
105 
 
106 
Pre-Laboratory Phase 
107 
Patients arrived at the laboratory after an overnight fast (>10 hours) having replicated their diet 
108 
in the previous 48 hours (assessed using weighed dietary recording sheets). Participants were 
109 
fitted with a real-time continuous glucose monitor (CGM; Paradigm Veo, Medtronic Diabetes, 
110 
Northridge, CA) as described previously 7, 11, 25-27 to aid in the maintenance of normal 
111 
glycaemia during the pre-laboratory period. Additionally, patients were instructed to maintain 
112 
their normal insulin regimen, with basal insulin dose standardized (dose, injection site, time of 
113 
injection) across conditions. Patients were also given a pedometer (Omron Healthcare Europe 
114 
B.V., Netherlands), which they were instructed to wear over the course of 24 hours prior to 
115 
experimental visits. Patients were required to avoid strenuous activity in the previous 48 hours 
116 
and maintain similar activity patterns between visits.  
117 
 
118 
Main Experimental Visits 
119 
In a randomised and counter-balanced fashion participants attended three separate morning 
120 
time (~07:00AM) laboratory-based visits, each interspersed by seven days. Upon arrival to the 
121 
laboratory, patients assumed a seated and rested position whilst a 20-gauge cannula (Vasofix, 
122 
B. Braun, Melsungen AG, Melsungen, Germany) was inserted into the antecubital vein of their 
123 
 Original Article 
non-dominant arm; resting, fasted, venous blood samples were then collected prior to 
124 
experimental testing. 
125 
 
126 
Each experimental visit involved the consumption of meals matched for carbohydrate and 
127 
protein content, but differing in 1) fat content and 2) rapid-acting insulin bolus dose and timing. 
128 
The LF condition involved administration of rapid-acting insulin according to individual 
129 
patient carbohydrate counting requirements (dose per 10 g: 1.1 ± 0.8IU) prior to the 
130 
consumption of a low-fat meal (Table 1). The HF condition involved administration of rapid-
131 
acting insulin according to the individual patient carbohydrate counting requirements (as 
132 
administered in LF), however, the meal contained an additional 50 g of fat to constitute a high-
133 
fat meal (Table 1). The HFA condition involved the administration of rapid-acting insulin 
134 
according to individual carbohydrate counting requirements (as administered in LF and HF) 
135 
prior to the consumption of a high-fat meal, and an additional 30% of rapid-acting insulin 
136 
administered at 180 minutes post-ingestion (Table 1). The aim of this was such that the 
137 
additional units of insulin would enter the circulation to coincide with the occurrence of peak 
138 
postprandial lipaemia 28. 
139 
 
140 
To minimise the influence of injection location on insulin absorption kinetics, the site of bolus 
141 
injection was standardised across visits using prominent anatomical landmarks (equidistant 
142 
from the most medial portion of the iliac crest and navel). 
143 
 
144 
Following meal consumption patients remained in a seated and rested position with blood 
145 
samples drawn every 30 minutes for 6 hours following meal consumption. Following this, 
146 
patients were discharged and returned home. Plasma Fibrinogen, Human Tissue Factor (HTF), 
147 
 Original Article 
and Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) were sampled at baseline, 3 hours post-meal, 
148 
and at 6 hours post-meal. 
149 
 
150 
Meal Composition 
151 
The macronutrient contribution to each meal is presented in Table 1; meal carbohydrate and 
152 
protein content were matched across conditions. The low-fat and high-fat meals were based 
153 
upon the composition of a curried dish consisting of basmati rice (Basmati Rice Basics, Tesco, 
154 
UK), tikka masala sauce (Mild Spice Tikka Masala, Weight Watchers, UK), and chicken 
155 
(Everyday Sliced Chicken, Tesco, UK). The amount of each food item was identical in each 
156 
condition and calculated such that carbohydrate content was individualised, equalling 1 g of 
157 
carbohydrate per Kg of body mass. In addition to the above, the high-fat meals included the 
158 
addition of an absolute amount of 50 g of clarified butter (Butter Ghee, East End Foods, UK) 
159 
which constitutes 99.9% fat.  
160 
 
161 
Blood Sampling 
162 
At each time point 10 ml of venous whole blood was taken and dispensed into serum separation 
163 
and lithium-heparin (Vacuette, Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Kremsmünster, Austria) tubes before 
164 
being centrifuged for 15 minutes at 2,000 g at 4˚C and stored at -80˚C for retrospective analysis 
165 
of Triglycerides (TG; Serum Triglyceride Determination Kit; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, 
166 
USA). Apolipoprotein B48 (APOB48; Apolipoprotein B48, Antibodies-online, USA), Non-
167 
Esterified-Fatty Acids (NEFA; RANBUT, Randox Laboratories, London, UK), plasma 
168 
Glucagon (Glucagon EIA, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), Tumour Necrosis Factor 
169 
alpha (TNF-�; Human TNF-� Quantikine ELISA, R&D Systems, Roche Diagnostics, West 
170 
Sussex, UK) were measured hourly. Plasma Fibrinogen (ab108842, Fibrinogen Human ELISA 
171 
Kit, Abcam, Japan), HTF (Human Tissue Factor activity ab108906, abcam, UK), and PAI-1 
172 
 Original Article 
(Human PAI-1/serpin ELISA Kit DSE100, R7D systems, UK) were measured at Rest, 3 hours 
173 
and 6 hours post-meal. The intra-assay coefficient of variation was < 10% for all assays. Due 
174 
to increased assay cross-reactivity with insulin detemir, only participants treated with insulin 
175 
glargine were included in serum insulin analysis (n = 8). 
176 
 
177 
Data Analysis 
178 
Sample size analyses was performed using data from Cohen and Berger 29, whereby increasing 
179 
insulinaemia via the co-ingestion of glucose lowered postprandial (3 hours) TG concentrations 
180 
from ~1.36 ± 0.24 mmol.l-1 to 0.85 ± 0.24 mmol.l-1. Based on these data, 10 participants should 
181 
provide >90% chance of statistically detecting a similar effect size with an -level of 0.05. 
182 
Statistical analysis was performed using PASW Statistics 18 software (IBM, Armonk, NY) 
183 
with significance set at p ≤ 0.05. Data were examined using repeated measures ANOVA 
184 
(condition*time). Where significant p-values were identified for interaction effects 
185 
(condition*time), Bonferroni corrected post-hoc analysis was performed. Significant main 
186 
effects of time were investigated using pairwise comparisons. Where relevant, one-way 
187 
ANOVA with Bonferroni adjusted pairwise comparisons was used to compare between 
188 
conditional differences. Data are presented as mean±SD unless stated otherwise.

interstitial glucose across visits. Throughout this time, patients demonstrated similar dietary 
198 
patterns, rapid-acting insulin administrations, and activity levels across conditions (p > 0.05; 
199 
Supplement 1). 
200 
 
201 
Laboratory Phase 
202 
TG concentrations following LF remained similar to baseline (Figure 1A; p > 0.05), whereas 
203 
TGs under HF were significantly greater throughout the 360 minute observation period (Figure 
204 
1A, B, C; p < 0.05). HFA elicited an increase in TGs similar to HF concentrations during the 
205 
first 180 minutes, but beyond 180 minutes concentrations returned to baseline and were 
206 
comparable to LF (Figure 1A, B, C; p > 0.05).  HF was also associated with elevated TNF-� 
207 
late into the postprandial period, whereas LF and HFA was not (Figure 2A, B; p < 0.05). The 
208 
CGM interstitial glucose responses are presented in Figure 2C. There was a significant 
209 
time*condition interaction (p = 0.02, partial-�2= 0.199), and a significant time (p < 0.01, 
210 
partial-�2= 0.753) and condition (p = 0.29, partial-�2= 0.324) effect in CGM interstitial glucose 
211 
responses to the conditions (Figure 2C), whereby HF resulted in higher interstitial glucose 
212 
concentrations in the late postprandial period compared to both LF and HFA (Figure 2C; p < 
213 
0.05). Interstitial glucose was comparable between conditions during the first 180 minutes with 
214 
similar total AUC0-180 (LF 4104±831, HF 5401±545, HFA 4959±525 mmol.l-1.min-1; p = 
215 
0.418) and absolute interstitial glucose levels at 180 minutes (LF 6.0±1.3, HF 7.0±0.7, HFA 
216 
6.3±0.7 mmol.l-1; p > 0.05; Figure 2C). Beyond 180 minutes, interstitial glucose levels were 
217 
greater under HFA (AUC180-360: LF 8518±1876, HF 14,591±1957 vs. HFA 11,011±1509 
218 
mmol.l-1.min-1; p < 0.05). The APOB48, NEFA, Glucagon, fibrinogen, HTF activity, and PAI-

Discussion 
227 
This is the first study to show that in adult type 1 diabetes patients treated with modern insulin 
228 
analogue injections, an additional rapid-acting insulin dose, provided 3 hours after ingestion of 
229 
a high-carbohydrate high-fat meal, reduces the late rise in lipaemia seen with when the 
230 
carbohydrate counting method for insulin administration at meal time is used alone. Moreover, 
231 
such a strategy provides a similar postprandial glycaemic and inflammatory response to a meal 
232 
with negligible fat content and does not augment the pro-coagulant response of fibrinogen, 
233 
HFP or PAI-1. In comparison, when following the carbohydrate counting method at meal time 
234 
alone patients are likely to experience raised lipaemia, hyperglycaemia, and elevated TNF-� 
235 
concentrations late into the post-prandial period. These findings further highlight the 
236 
importance of an additional but delayed insulin bolus not just for glucose control per se, but 
237 
for normalisation of a milieu potentially promoting vascular damage.  
238 
 
239 
Our data show that the addition of dietary fat increases rapid-acting insulin dose requirements, 
240 
similar to that shown previously in patients using (CSII) 8, 30-33. For example, Wolpert et al. 8 
241 
showed that under closed-loop glucose control, the insulin requirement for a high-fat evening 
242 
meal was increased by ~42%, in comparison to a carbohydrate-matched, low-fat meal. The 
243 
present study furthers these previous findings by examining how adjusting the dose and timing 
244 
of rapid-acting insulin administration influences the metabolic milieu and cardiovascular risk 
245 
factors associated with consuming mixed macronutrient meals; to date has not been examined 
246 
within the literature. Our data demonstrate that when administering rapid-acting insulin to 
247 
 Original Article 
cover only the carbohydrate content of the meal (as in the HF condition) patients are exposed 
248 
to raised triglycerides and TNF-� at 4-6 hours post-meal (Figure 1A-C, Figure 1A). In addition, 
249 
we observed a trend towards an increase in fibrinogen late into the postprandial period; our 
250 
sample size was likely too small for yield statistical significance in this individual marker, 
251 
however our findings indicate an increased inflammatory and thrombotic response following 
252 
high-carbohydrate, high-fat meal feeding in people with type 1 diabetes that can be prevented 
253 
with an additional delayed bolus of insulin. These data call for a larger scale observation of the 
254 
thrombotic responses to high-carbohydrate high-fat meal feeding, and it is recommended that 
255 
subsequent interventions to reduce post-prandial lipaemia consider this as a potentially 
256 
important outcome. 
257 
 
258 
Prior research has shown that high-fat meals (> 70 grams of fat) can increase pro-coagulation 
259 
markers 34, 35, however in the measures we chose, we saw no influence of meal type or dosing 
260 
strategy. The fat content of the meals within this study was chosen such that they replicated 
261 
meals that may habitually be consumed by patients (~50 grams of fat), and may simply not 
262 
have been large enough for subtle changes in insulin dose (+30% equalling ~2.6 IU) and timing 
263 
to cause a demonstrable effect at the respective sample points. Additionally, the postprandial 
264 
glucose excursions were only moderately hyperglycaemic under both high-fat conditions. 
265 
 
266 
It is noteworthy that foods with different fatty acid profiles may elicit different postprandial 
267 
lipaemic 28 and inflammatory 36 responses, potentially mediated via modulation of insulin 
268 
sensitivity 37, gastric emptying 38, gut hormones responses 38, circulating adhesion molecules 
269 
39, and oxidative stress generation 39, 40. Fats predominantly saturated and of long-chain in 
270 
composition cause a delayed postprandial lipaemic response 28, 34. The fatty acid profile of the 
271 
clarified butter added to the meals in the present study was ~62% saturated and 29% 
272 
 Original Article 
monounsaturated fat, which, as highlighted in this study is likely to result in a delayed and 
273 
exaggerated lipaemic response occurring beyond the action time profiles of modern rapid-
274 
acting insulin analogues if administered as a single bolus at the time of meal ingestion 41. As 
275 
such, the differential responses between HF and HFA in late lipaemia can be attributed to our 
276 
insulin administration strategy, considering i) glycaemia was similar between conditions up to 
277 
180 minutes post-meal, and ii) the triglyceride response under HF beyond 180 minutes is 
278 
comparable to previous observations profiling time-course lipaemic responses in individuals 
279 
without type 1 diabetes following high-fat feeding 42.  
280 
 
281 
Prior research examining the interactions of protein in isolation 43, 44 and in combination with 
282 
carbohydrate and fat 32, shows that protein can raise postprandial glucose late after feeding, 
283 
with additive effects when combined with fat 32. Meal protein content was kept under 30 g, 
284 
such that no bolus insulin dose adjustment for the protein content would be needed 45; indeed, 
285 
under the LF condition, patients demonstrated no late postprandial hyperglycaemia, with all 
286 
patients remaining within euglycaemic ranges when the carbohydrate counting method was 
287 
employed.

In conclusion, these are the first data to demonstrate that when eating a meal with a high-
291 
carbohydrate and high-fat content, an additional insulin dose provided 3 hours into the 
292 
postprandial period reduces plasma triglyceride concentrations and inflammatory markers in 
293 
type 1 diabetes patients. Thus people with type 1 diabetes treated with basal-bolus insulin 
294 
injections should be encouraged to carbohydrate count at meal time and administer additional 
295 
insulin units 3 hours into the postprandial period when consuming a high-carbohydrate, high-
296 
fat meal. Not accounting for the fat component of the meal is associated with raised blood 
297 
 Original Article 
lipids, delayed glucose excursions, and increased inflammation. Based on our findings, patients 
298 
should be advised of the importance of the late bolus not just for glucose control, but for also 
299 
normalising other markers that may negatively influence vascular health.
