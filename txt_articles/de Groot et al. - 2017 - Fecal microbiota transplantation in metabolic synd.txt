ABSTRACT
The history of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) dates back even to ancient China. Recently,
scientific studies have been looking into FMT as a promising treatment of various diseases, while in
the process teaching us about the interaction between the human host and its resident microbial
communities. Current research focuses mainly on Clostridium difficile infections, however interest is
rising in other areas such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and the metabolic syndrome.
With regard to the latter, the intestinal microbiota might be causally related to the progression of
insulin resistance and diabetes. FMT in metabolic syndrome has proven to be an intriguing method
to study the role of the gut microbiota and open the way to new therapies by dissecting in whom
insulin resistance is driven by microbiota. In this article we review the history of FMT, the present
evidence on its role in the pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome and its efficacy, limitations and
future prospects.

The history of fecal microbiota transplantation
The recent scientific upsurge in the field of gut micro-
biota has firmly established its role in contemporary
clinical medicine. However, the history of fecal infusions
in medicine is much longer. Today we know that fecal
microbiota transplantation (FMT) or ‘bacteriotherapy’
may also transfer host phenotype. This section will pro-
vide a historical overview of FMT indications and appli-
cations, and how it has evolved into its current use.
Historical applications of fecal transplantation (300
AD –1950 AD)
The first records of fecal transplantation date back to
4th century China, where “yellow soup” was applied
in cases of severe food poisoning and diarrhea.1 Subse-
quent records reverently speak of “golden syrup.”2 By
the 16th century, the Chinese had developed a variety
of feces-derived products for gastrointestinal com-
plaints as well as systemic symptoms such as fever and
pain.1 Meanwhile, Bedouin groups were said to have
consumed the stools of their camels as a remedy for
bacterial dysentery.3 Italian anatomist and surgeon
Acquapendente (1537–1619) further extended this to
a concept he coined “transfaunation,” the transfer of
gastrointestinal content from a healthy to a sick ani-
mal, which has since been applied extensively in the
field of veterinary medicine.4 Interestingly, many ani-
mal species are found to naturally practice copropha-
gia, leading to a greater diversity of microorganisms in
their intestines, enabling them to digest a greater
number of food sources.5
Slowly these ideas began to spark interest in 18th
century European physicians. German born Christian
Paullini (1643–1712) was the first to outline the thera-
peutic potential of human excretions in his work the
“Heilsame Dreck-Apotheke” (literally: healing mud
pharmacy).4 The fundamental discovery by Antoni
van Leeuwenhoek that his stool contained microbes –
“God’s smallest creatures”6 – as well as observations
from the Russian zoologist Metchnikoff (1845–1916),
laid an early foundation for the modern field of

 microbiota study.7 Inspired by the reports of longevity
in Bulgarian farmers despite their poor living condi-
tions, Metchnikoff introduced fermented products in
his diet and noted improvements in his general health.
He hypothesized this to be due to an altered balance
in colonic microbes, with an increase in lactic acid
bacteria (still called “Lactobacillus bulgaricus”) pro-
tecting against senescence-accelerating toxins. Metch-
nikoff’s bacteria captured public interest and were
successfully marketed during his lifetime. His concept
of increasing the number of beneficial microbes in the
gut in an attempt to improve human health, clearly
shows a historic use of probiotics avant la lettre. In a
similar light, German bacteriologist and physician
Alfred Nissle isolated an Escherichia coli strain that to
date bears his name. Initially, the microorganism was
found protective against Shigella outgrowth and sub-
sequent gastroenteritis, but its impact in human health
was later extended to include chronic inflammatory
conditions.8
Soon gut bacteria would also be found valuable in
recovering
from
infectious
gastroenteritis.
When
German soldiers of the ‘Afrikakorps’ were dying of
locally contracted dysentery in the early 1940s, Nazi
scientists were determined to find a cause and cure.
Observations of better-faring locals who would take in
fresh camel stools upon the first signs of illness led
them to analyze the feces and isolate Bacillus subtilis.
Subsequent culturing and administration of the bacte-
rium resolved the disease in many.9
By now, the numerous examples of microbes influ-
encing human health have set the stage for a more
thorough examination of its applications, and the first
controlled studies using therapeutic fecal suspensions
have emerged.
FMT in modern science (1950s-2000)
Antibiotics, since their discovery generously pre-
scribed, have ended an era in which infectious diseases
were the most common cause of death. But antibiotics
also came with side-effects and antimicrobial resis-
tance. In an attempt to ameliorate collateral damage
on commensal microbes, bacteriologist Stanley Falkow
sampled fecal material from surgical patients before
starting them on pre-procedural antibiotics (Fig. 1).10
After converting the stools into pill form, he pre-
scribed their daily intake to half of the group during
post-surgical recovery, an idea so repelling at the time
it got him fired when the administrative board found
out. Anecdotal evidence from this study in the early
1950s describes better outcomes in the treatment
group, but the data of the unofficial ‘Ersatz’10 trial
were never published.
In the succeeding year, a group of Colorado-based
surgeons led by Dr. Eiseman performed an experiment
along the same rationale: that restoration of a healthy
gut microbial balance can improve patients’ health.
After numerous other therapies had failed to effectu-
ate recovery, they treated 4 patients critically ill with
pseudomembranous colitis with fecal enemas from
healthy donors. Results were impressive, with rapid
and complete recovery in all subjects.11 In the follow-
ing 2 decades, 16 more cases were selected to undergo
the same procedure. The attained 94% success rate
despite the poor prognosis in this therapy-refractory
patient group proved promising.12
By this time, the cause of this potentially life-threat-
ening condition had been identified as infection by the
gram-positive anaerobe spore forming bacterium
Clostridium difficile, often provoked by antibiotic
use.13 Because of clinical similarities between infec-
tious and non-infectious types of colitis, physicians
started to speculate whether FMT could also be of
help in inflammatory bowel disease and irritable
bowel syndrome (IBD and IBS).14 The earliest record
of FMT for a non-infectious disease concerns a
45-year old male having refractory ulcerative colitis
(UC), showing full and lasting clinical recovery upon
“an exchange of bowel flora.”15 Numerous subsequent
case studies focused on a multitude of gastrointestinal
complaints.15-17 In the majority of cases, patients were
found to “[positively] respond to manipulation”17 of
their microbiome following the colonic administration
of a mixture of microflora from unaffected individuals.
By the turn of the century, new insights connect-
ing gut microbes to the pathophysiology of extra-
intestinal diseases would broaden the applications
of FMT.
FMT in extra-intestinal disease (2000-current)
Over 700 patients are reported to have been treated
with FMT for recurrent Clostridium difficile infec-
tion (CDI) since Eiseman’s experiment.4 Three
recent randomized controlled trials have reported
cure rates of 90% or higher.18-20 In general, the
treatment effect is lasting,21,22 and safe, with no
254

 related side-effects or newly acquired medical con-
ditions during follow-up, even when performed in
vulnerable patient groups.18,21,23-25
As the burden shifted from infectious to non-com-
municable disorders, the range of FMT applications
extended. Recent case-reports even include incidental
findings of post-FMT remission in extra-gastrointesti-
nal conditions like multiple sclerosis,14 Parkinson,26
idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura14 and chronic
fatigue.14 Another microbiota-associated disease is
kwashiorkor (severe malnutrition), which Smith and
colleagues studied in 2013 in children in Malawi. They
investigated 317 twin pairs for 3 y (from birth until
3 y of age). During these 3 years, 50% of the twin pairs
stayed well nourished, but 7% manifested concordance
for acute malnutrition and 43% became discordant for
malnutrition.27 Hereafter, they transplanted fecal
microbiota from discordant pairs into germ-free mice.
Mice that received gut microbiota from kwashiorkor
children showed significant weight loss, along with
dysregulation
of
carbohydrate
and
amino
acid
metabolism.28
Strategies attempting to tackle the other end of the
metabolic spectrum, the obesity epidemic, have failed
to generate satisfactory results.29,30 However, much
recent animal and human evidence points toward a
possible role for gut microbiome manipulation in
reestablishing energy homeostasis. The following sec-
tion will briefly review how the microbiome has
become connected to the pathophysiology of meta-
bolic syndrome and how FMT may aid future
therapy.

 Animal FMT studies in metabolic syndrome
Experimental evidence in animals connecting the
intestinal microbiota to the metabolic syndrome is
widely available. Owing to the creation of germ-free
(GF) mice by prof. Jeffrey Gordon and technological
advances in sequencing methods, scientists were able
to prove causality of microbial involvement in weight
management and glucose and lipid metabolism.
For example, B€
ackhed and colleagues induced
weight gain and increased insulin resistance in GF
(C56BL/6) mice upon oral administration of fecal
material from their conventional counterparts, despite
a simultaneous reduction of food intake.31 Researchers
attributed this to a more effective carbohydrate uptake
(and subsequent lipolysis leading to increased body fat
content) due to processing of nutrients by the micro-
organisms present.31 Conventionalization of GF mice
also amplified the weight gain after putting these mice
on a Western or high-fat diet (HFD).29,32 Next, the
recipient GF mice of feces from obese (ob/ob) donor
mice put on significantly more weight compared with
recipients of feces from lean donor mice.30
Ley et al. (2005) went on to show that under similar
dietary circumstances, ob/ob mice carry significantly
less Bacteroidetes and more Firmicutes in their guts
compared with lean ob/C and wild-type mice.33
A recent study with Sprague-Dawley rats confirmed
this microbial signature, where fecal transplants from
rats on a control diet restored a rise in plasma fatty
acid and glucose intolerance after fructose-induced
metabolic syndrome.34 Interestingly, glucose tolerance
improved significantly through the administration of
an antibiotic mix of ampicillin and neomycin. Ridaura
and colleagues (2013) were the first to transplant
human feces into GF (C57BL/6J) mice and confirmed
increased weight gain upon transfer of fecal material
derived from an obese adult compared with that of
her lean twin.35 Moreover, co-housing the obese sam-
ple recipients with lean-donor animals showed a
decrease of obese phenotype acquisition.
Finally, a recent study by Liou et al. (2013) suggests
that the positive metabolic effects of Roux-en-Y gastric
bypass (RYGB) surgery is partly be due to an altered
composition of the gut microbiota.36 They have per-
formed FMT in GF-mice from patients that had
undergone RYGB surgery. This procedure resulted in
significant loss of weight and fat mass compared with
the GF-mice that had received gut microbiota from
mice that had undergone a sham procedure. Data vali-
dating these effects in humans are eagerly awaited.
FMT in human metabolic syndrome
In the same period, further emphasis was placed on
the role of gut microbiota in metabolic disease in
humans and on human microbiota variation. Of note,
Arumugam described different human enterotypes37
and Karlsson showed that analysis gut microbiota
composition can predict metabolic status.38
Interestingly, the first record of sudden weight gain
following FMT dates from 1983, as an incidental finding
after resolution of recurrent CDI in an adult female
patient. Another such case of “new-onset obesity” was
published recently, warranting caution in considering the
use of obese donor material for fecal transplantations.39
Concerning the treatment of metabolic syndrome
with FMT, the only human study to date was per-
formed by Vrieze et al. (2012), which suggests that
FMT
from
lean
unaffected
donors
temporarily
increases peripheral insulin sensitivity (with a similar
yet not statistically significant trend toward improved
hepatic insulin resistance).40 In line with results
obtained from the animal models, these changes were
found to be positively correlated with an increase in
the number of butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut.
In conclusion, previous findings suggest a causal
relation between the gut microbiota and metabolic
syndrome,
but
the
(patho)physiologic
pathways
remain to be elucidated. In the next section we will
first discuss the pathophysiology of metabolic syn-
drome and then the role that gut microbiota may play.
The role of gut microbiota in the pathophysiology of
the metabolic syndrome
The prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its
sequelae has risen to epidemic proportions to become
one of the most pressing global health problems of
our time. The metabolic syndrome is a cluster of
symptoms, defined by insulin resistance, dyslipidemia,
high blood pressure and increased abdominal girth,
which are strongly associated with the development of
type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The hepatic
manifestation of metabolic syndrome, though not part
of its criteria, is non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
(NAFLD)
and
its
vascular
manifestation
is
atherosclerosis.

 The historical overview has explained how we came
to use FMT in the context of metabolic syndrome. In
this section we will first address the pathophysiology
of the metabolic syndrome in general with the role of
low-grade inflammatory changes particular and then
continue by focusing on the role of the gut microbiota
and and the possible mechanisms through which they
influence host metabolism.
Inflammation and insulin resistance
Studies in the early 20th century already showed that
high-dose salicylates attenuate glycosuria in patients,
providing early clues that insulin resistance is second-
ary to inflammation. This was largely ignored until
the 1990s, when it was shown that insulin resistance
can be provoked by pro-inflammatory cytokines such
as tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa).41 A review by
Shoelson et al. in 2006 provides an excellent summary
on the inflammatory mechanisms of insulin resis-
tance.42 One important pathway is through c-Jun
amino-terminal kinases (JNK), activated by inflamma-
tory cytokines and free fatty acids. JNK is increased in
obese individuals and absence of JNK results in
improved insulin sensitivity.43 Inflammatory pathways
(such as JNK and NF-kB) are also induced by obesity-
related endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.44 JNK
changes the function of insulin receptor substrate 1
(IRS-1), which regulates insulin and insulin-like
growth factor pathways.45 These pathways play an
important role in age-related disease and life span in
animal models.46,47 Also, inflammation goes hand-in-
hand with lipid accumulation in the vessel wall as an
early sign of atherosclerosis, demonstrating the link
between
lipid
accumulation,
atherosclerosis
and
inflammation
as
hallmark
of
the
metabolic
syndrome.42
Another important mechanism that plays a role in
insulin sensitivity and obesity is mediated through
nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors
(PPARs), of which PPARg is best characterized.
PPARg is expressed in many tissues including liver,
muscle and adipose tissue and its activation attenuates
hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia by regulation of
metabolic genes.48 Thiazolidinediones, a class of syn-
thetic oral glucose lowering drugs, are strong agonists
of PPARg. Macrophages highly express PPARg, fur-
ther intertwining inflammation and insulin resis-
tance.48 In vitro studies have shown that statins also
induce PPARg-mediated transcriptional activity in
macrophages, beside other anti-inflammatory effects
like inhibiting lipopolysaccharide-induced TNFa tran-
scription and the NF-kB pathway,49 implying the
effects of statins in metabolic syndrome may in fact be
partly
anti-inflammatory
and
mediated
through
PPARy.
In conclusion, there is a firm base of evidence link-
ing the spectrum of metabolic dysfunction seen in
metabolic syndrome to inflammation. In the next par-
agraph we present evidence that this inflammation
may derive from the gut.
“Leaky gut”
In the last decades, a solid base of evidence has linked
the inflammatory state in metabolic syndrome to
impaired gut barrier function and leakage of bacteria
and/or bacterial components into the system.50,51
Resulting low grade endotoxemia (and possibly bac-
teremia) chronically activates inflammatory path-
ways.52 Bacterial components may also migrate to
target organs,53,54 leading to an influx of macrophages
that contribute to local as well as systemic low grade
inflammation and insulin resistance.52 The intestinal
barrier consists of many components each contribut-
ing to its function in unique ways: an epithelial lining
conjoined by junction proteins, thick (‘outer’ and
‘inner’) mucus layers, a bacteria deterring glycocalix,55
luminal immunoactive components such as IgA, cyto-
kines and mast cell proteases and gut-associated lym-
phoid tissue trained to discriminate commensals from
pathogens.56 Malfunction of any component can be
described as impaired gut barrier function and may or
may not lead to bacterial translocation depending on
the defect. These different components of the gut bar-
rier can be assessed in different indirect ways, each
with its own limitations, as elegantly reviewed by
Grootjans et al.57 Several clues that the gut becomes
permeable to bacteria in metabolic syndrome have
been uncovered, but it should be noted that direct evi-
dence of actual live bacterial translocation in humans
in the context of metabolic syndrome has not yet been
delivered. The first studies linking gut barrier disrup-
tion to metabolic derangement have shown increased
paracellular transport and impaired tight junction
function using oral ingestion of substances, such as
lactulose and mannitol, sucralose, polyethylene glycols
(PEG) or 51Cr-EDTA and measuring their urinary
GUT MICROBES
257
 excretion.58 It is unlikely however that large molecules,
let alone bacteria, are transported paracellularly.59 In
contrast, bacteria may enter the body by endocytosis,
which has been observed in the absence of tight junc-
tional damage,59 when the epithelial cell layer is com-
promised
by
apoptosis,
cell
damage,
during
physiologic cell shedding, or when the mucus layer is
impaired. Incidentally, a recent study emphasized the
importance of dietary fibers in maintaining the mucus
layer by showing that fiber-deprived microbiota use
the colonic mucus layer as an alternative food
source.60
A different approach to demonstrate impaired
intestinal barrier function is by looking for bacterial
signatures in the circulation. Many diseases, including
metabolic syndrome, have been linked to endotoxe-
mia, i.e. the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in
the blood, a supposed proxy for translocation of
gram-negative bacteria. LPS infusion in rodents
showed an increase in insulin resistance to a similar
extent as a high-fat diet.61 However, in humans this is
still not proven due to reliability issues of endotoxin
assays, conflicting study outcomes and the question
whether LPS found in metabolic syndrome subjects is
actually bioactive.62 Also, transportation of endotoxin
and bacteria in metabolic syndrome occurs mainly by
route of the lymphatic system and the portal vein.63,64
In both cases, it will first pass a target organ (the liver
or via the thoracic lymph duct and the arterial circula-
tion to a different tissue), before it can be measured in
a venous blood sample, complicating adequate mea-
surement in humans.
Finally, data in various disease states support the
hypothesis of microbiota translocation to the blood
stream51 and target organs such as the vessel wall in
atherosclerosis,53 the liver in non-alcoholic steatohe-
patitis65 and mesenteric adipose tissue in inflamma-
tory bowel disease.54 It would be very interesting to
investigate whether presence of gut bacteria can also
be demonstrated in the blood, the mesenteric lymph
nodes or other peripheral tissues of human metabolic
syndrome subjects, e.g. by taking tissue samples dur-
ing elective surgery.
Ways in which the gut microbiota contribute to the
metabolic syndrome
We have already described the inflammatory mecha-
nisms through which gut microbes might affect host
metabolism. Another important mechanism is the
production of signaling molecules by gut microbes.
These can affect gut integrity, the immune system and
satiety and may impact host metabolic phenotype.
Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) provide the most
well-studied example. SCFAs, such as acetate, propio-
nate and butyrate, are small molecules metabolized by
gut microbes from dietary fibers, for which receptors
are ubiquitous in the body, resulting in numerous
complex effects, reviewed by Den Besten et al. in
201366 and by Canfora et al.67 in 2015 in more detail.
Their effects include upregulation of tight junction
proteins such as claudin-1 (butyrate),68 epigenetic reg-
ulation of immune cells through HDAC-inhibition
(butyrate),69 altering of intestinal gluconeogenesis,70
increasing plasma incretin hormones, reduction of
TNFa (acetate)71,66 and changing lipid and glucose
metabolism (propionate, butyrate).72,73
Bile acids (BA) are another class of molecules that
play a role in microbiota-host communication, medi-
ated by nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR).
This interaction seems an important determinant of
metabolic health, as FXR-deficient mice that are fed a
high-fat diet or those that are genetically predisposed
toward obesity have better glucose regulation than
control mice with normally functioning FXR.74 Evi-
dence from animal studies is solid, but human studies
on this topic are still lacking. Current evidence on
microbiota-BA interaction and the receptors involved
was well-reviewed recently by Wahlstr€
om et al.74
Finally, metagenomic studies in humans have
identified various specific gut microbiota changes in
individuals with metabolic syndrome38 including
malevolent microbes that contribute to insulin resis-
tance, such as Prevotella copri and Bacteroides vulga-
tus,75 but also beneficial species such as Akkermansia
municiphila,76,77 and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii,78
which are associated with increased insulin sensitiv-
ity. Of note, a newly discovered mechanism of action
of the widely used glucose lowering drug metformin
was shown in diet-induced obese mice, where it
improved glucose homeostasis by increasing the pop-
ulation of Akkermansia species.76 Several other
examples of specific interactions of gut microbes
with the host are discussed in the following para-
graphs by reviewing the literature on the involve-
ment of gut microbes in several other aspects of the
metabolic syndrome: atherosclerosis, hepatic steato-
sis and elevated blood pressure.

 Microbiota and atherosclerosis
The connection between gut microbiota and athero-
sclerosis was already described in 1999, when endo-
toxin levels, following bacterial translocation, were
found to be independently correlated with cardiovas-
cular outcome and carotid atherosclerosis measured
by
duplex
ultrasound.79
Traditional
risk
factors
explain about half of the atherosclerotic burden in lin-
ear regression. Genetics are believed to explain
another 10 percent. Microbiota and their many meta-
bolic products may largely account for the rest.80 For
example, DNA of oral microbiota Veillonella and
Streptococcus was found in plaques of individuals with
atherosclerosis and their abundance correlated with
the abundance of these species in the oral cavity.53 As
for gut microbiota, Karlsson et al. found in 2012 that
atherosclerosis is associated with a different gut meta-
genome.81 One mechanism of microbiota-mediated
atherosclerosis induction that has been elucidated is
through L-carnitine and phosphatidylcholine (from
red meat, cheese and eggs). These food components
are first converted by the microbiota to TMA, then by
the liver into TMAO, which increases atherosclerotic
burden82 and promotes a prothrombotic phenotype.83
Microbiota can also protect from atherosclerosis, as
recently
shown
when
Akkermansia
municiphila
reversed Western diet-induced atherosclerosis and
endotoxemia in ApoE-knockout mice.77 Another
recent study in ApoE-KO mice showed that probiotic
mixture VSL#3 can protect from atherosclerosis.84
Furthermore, germ free mice showed attenuation of
vascular leukocyte infiltration and adhesion and of
monocyte attractant protein MCP-1 and proinflam-
matory cytokine IL-17 in response to an angiotensin
II challenge.85
Microbiota and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
and -steatohepatitis
Several human studies show microbiota differences in
people with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)86
or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD),87,88
compared with healthy controls. Also, people with
NALFD have increased LPS-binding peptide levels in
the plasma.89 In individuals with NASH levels are
even higher and correlate to TNF-a mRNA expression
in liver tissue, pointing toward a role for endotoxemia
in inflammatory liver steatosis.89 Furthermore, apart
from increased endotoxemia, people with NAFLD
have increased intestinal permeability, which corre-
lates with bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine
and severity of steatosis.90 No human studies on FMT
in NASH or NAFLD have been performed yet, but in
mice it has been shown that antibiotics can reduce
portal endotoxin levels and hepatic accumulation of
lipids.91 Furthermore, adding Bifidobacterium pseudo-
catenulatum to a high-fat diet (HFD) decreased insu-
lin resistance and liver steatosis when compared with
only a HFD in C57BL-6 mice.92 Also, microbiota
transfer of inflammasome-deficient mice to wild-type
mice exacerbated hepatic steatosis and portal endo-
toxin influx.93 In line, microbiota transfer from a
mouse with a HFD-induced phenotype of insulin-
resistance and inflammation reproduced this pheno-
type in recipient mice, whereas the microbiota from a
mouse fed the similar HFD that did not develop insu-
lin resistance or inflammation failed to do so.94 These
studies all show microbiota-mediated effects on liver
phenotype in mice. A human intervention trial, albeit
not placebo controlled, showed a decrease in intrahe-
patic triglyceride content measured by magnetic reso-
nance spectroscopy upon addition of probiotics to
usual care.95 Finally, since decades, increased intestinal
permeability has been linked to alcohol (ab)use.96
Recently however, studies point toward a role for etha-
noL-producing microbes in the etiology of NASH and
NAFLD,97 bridging alcoholic and ‘non-alcoholic’
causes of steatohepatitis through the microbiome. A
randomized clinical trial is currently being performed
at our department to see if the effects of fecal micro-
biota transfer from healthy donors can attenuate
NAFLD and NASH severity (Dutch trial register,
http://www.trialregister.nl/NTR4339).
Microbiota and blood pressure
Elevated blood pressure is a common feature of meta-
bolic syndrome, but literature on gut microbial
involvement is still modest. Several interesting discov-
eries have been made that suggest a more direct influ-
ence
than
merely
through
an
increase
of
atherosclerotic burden. First of all, a decreased micro-
biota diversity and a decreased Firmicutes/Bacteroi-
detes ratio in humans and in 2 rat models for
hypertension was found. More importantly, the blood
pressure in these rat models could be corrected by
increasing the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio with
antibiotics.98
GUT MICROBES
259
 A possible mechanism through which alterations in
the gut microbiota can induce hypertension is through
SCFAs, as it was recently found that SCFA-receptor
olfactory receptor 78 (Olfr78) is expressed in the kid-
ney and mediates renin production in response to pro-
pionate.99 Moreover, this receptor and G protein-
coupled receptor 41 (GRP41) were found in the
smooth muscle cells of blood vessels, where they
increase blood pressure in response to microbiota-
derived SCFAs.99
Future perspectives: Microbiota as therapy
Now that we have outlined current evidence on gut
microbial involvement in the metabolic syndrome, we
will speculate in this final section on the therapeutic
possibilities offered by this promising new field of gut
microbiota.
Although only one small placebo-controlled RCT
has altered the gut microbiota through FMT and
showed causality in the interaction between gut
microbiota and metabolic syndrome in humans,40
many studies have shown that gut microbiota play a
role in all aspects of the metabolic syndrome, includ-
ing insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis,
hepatic steatosis and elevated blood pressure. Now is
the time to further investigate these claims using well-
designed randomized placebo-controlled studies fea-
turing FMT that focus on unraveling the mechanisms
through which gut bacteria interact with host metabo-
lism, by monitoring microbiota changes and engraft-
ment of beneficial and pathogenic bacterial strains in
the intestinal microbiome over time,100 recording
changes in metabolites (e.g., short-chain fatty acids,
bile acids, incretin hormones), investigating genetic
and epigenetic effects (e.g., on the immune system),
all while taking dietary habits into account, to ulti-
mately develop novel, more attractive and personal-
ized strategies to manipulate the microbiota.101
As mentioned earlier, the most widely accepted
explanation for the origin of metabolic syndrome is
translocation of endotoxin (LPS) or direct transloca-
tion of gram-negative microbes, causing low grade
inflammation. However, data on this phenomenon are
still inconclusive. Current research should look exten-
sively into this topic, since it is a key component that
will lead to insight and hopefully effective treatment
modalities in the future.
Furthermore, until recently the majority of intesti-
nal microbes could not be cultured. However recent
endeavors in culturing these mostly anaerobic micro-
biota proved successful and challenged the notion that
most microbiota is unculturable.102 Browne and col-
leagues used fresh fecal samples to test a novel method
based on targeted phenotypic culturing, using broad-
range growth medium called YCFA. Overall, 137 dis-
tinct species were isolated, 90 of which were on the
Human Microbiome Project’s “most wanted” list of
previously uncultured and unsequenced microbes.102
These inspiring results will hopefully lead to further
insights on the function and interactions between var-
ious gut microbes and help improve understanding
which cases will respond to FMT and which will not,
which remains a vital question. Moreover, it is not
only the question which microbes should be infused
but also how many species or strains are needed to
alter the gut microbiota effectively.103 Studies to date
have mainly been limited to genus- and species-com-
parisons and have not clarified to which extent donor
microbiota colonizes a recipient.104 Previous findings
in non-FMT settings found that newly introduced
(non-pathological) strains are not able to persevere in
an established gut ecosystem, particularly if the species
were already present.105,106 We have recently found
that effective colonization by donor fecal bacteria
(engraftment) is partly driven by the gut microbial
composition of the recipient and differs between met-
abolic syndrome subjects.104 The next step will be a
more precise manipulation of the gut microbiota, for
example by introducing specific microbes to outcom-
pete undesirable strains.
Finally, FMT has logistical challenges and is associ-
ated with several risks (e.g., infections), undesirable
outcomes (e.g., increased risk of microbiota-associated
diseases, such as new-onset obesity) and distaste by
the recipients and doctors, the so called ‘yuck’fac-
tor.107 Isolating specific bacterial strains for the pro-
duction of novel probiotics could be a safer and more
elegant treatment.108 This process raises 2 major chal-
lenges that preclude rapid translation into clinical
practice. First of all, regulation of FMT can be a major
hurdle. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
has determined that FMT constitutes a biologic prod-
uct and drug and therefore maintained that the FMT
process (e.g., donor eligibility, screening and stool
processing) falls under FDA jurisdiction.109 Because
safety and efficacy has not yet been proven with large
260
P. F. DE GROOT ET AL.
 RCTs, investigational new drug application (IND) is
required for fecal transplantation in the US. In Europe
however, FMT has no such status, which makes it eas-
ier to use FMT in clinical trials while at the same time
studying
pathophysiological
mechanisms.
In
this
phase we deem it critical to characterize donors in
detail, constantly adjust donor screening to the most
recent insights and to closely monitor long-term
effects in recipients. After beneficial strains have iden-
tified using FMT, another hurdle concerns the cultur-
ing and storage of therapeutically interesting bacterial
strains under good manufacturing practice, which are
2 essential, but also time consuming factors.108
In conclusion, FMT will allow us to study the path-
ophysiology of metabolic syndrome and help us to
identify novel therapeutic targets. In this endeavor, we
should study specific host genetic, epigenetic, dietary
and microbial characteristics to be able to predict ther-
apeutic efficacy of these novel nutritional, pre-, pro-
and post-biotic interventions,110,111 which will enable
us to modulate disease phenotype through manipula-
tion of the gut microbiota using a personalized
approach.110
