Abstract
Language experience shapes infants’ abilities to process speech sounds, with universal phonetic discrimination abilities
narrowing in the second half of the first year. Brain measures reveal a corresponding change in neural discrimination as the
infant brain becomes selectively sensitive to its native language(s). Whether and how bilingual experience alters the transition to
native language specific phonetic discrimination is important both theoretically and from a practical standpoint. Using whole
head magnetoencephalography (MEG), we examined brain responses to Spanish and English syllables in Spanish-English
bilingual and English monolingual 11-month-old infants. Monolingual infants showed sensitivity to English, while bilingual
infants were sensitive to both languages. Neural responses indicate that the dual sensitivity of the bilingual brain is achieved by a
slower transition from acoustic to phonetic sound analysis, an adaptive and advantageous response to increased variability in
language input. Bilingual neural responses extend into the prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex, which may be related to their
previously described bilingual advantage in executive function skills. A video abstract of this article can be viewed at: https://

Introduction
From cooing and babbling to the production of words
and sentences, children learn their native language(s)
within the first three years of life. Because neither adults
nor computers can accomplish this task as effectively,
understanding the process by which the infant brain
encodes language presents one of the key questions in
neuroscience. Recent research indicates that infants learn
rapidly from exposure to language, combining pattern
detection and computational abilities with unique social
skills (Saffran, Aslin & Newport, 1996; Kuhl, Tsao &
Liu, 2003). A key element in this process is the child’s
language experience: Studies consistently show that
quality and quantity of language input are strongly
associated with the rate of subsequent language growth

 2016), real time language processing (Weisleder &
Fernald, 2013), and brain measures in language relevant
areas (Noble, Houston, Kan & Sowell, 2012).
To date, the literature on language acquisition has
focused predominantly on children acquiring a single
language. However, a growing number of children
worldwide grow up bilingually, clearly indicating that
the infant brain is capable of encoding not only one, but
multiple languages simultaneously. The existing research
suggests that, in general, the same learning mechanisms
that are used to prepare the monolingual infant to attend
to a single language are also used to prepare the bilingual
infant to attend to two languages, without confusing
them (Werker, Byers-Heinlein & Fennell, 2009). Studies
with infants prenatally exposed to two languages from
different rhythmic classes show that they begin to
discriminate their two languages from birth (Byers-
Heinlein, Burns & Werker, 2010). Like monolingual
babies, bilingual babies use auditory and visual cues to
discriminate their two languages (Weikum, Voulouma-
nos, Navarra, Soto-Faraco, Sebasti�
an-Gall�
es et al.,
2007).
Much less clear is whether and how dual language
exposure affects phonetic learning towards the end of
the first year of life. Phonetic learning has been termed
a ‘pathway to language’ because it reliably predicts
many subsequent stages in language acquisition, such
as lexical and grammatical growth (Kuhl, Conboy,
Coffey-Corina, Padden, Rivera-Gaxiola et al., 2008). A
central phenomenon in phonetic learning is the tran-
sition
from
universal
to
native
language
specific
phonetic
discrimination:
Until
about
6 months
of
age, infants are capable of discriminating among many,
if not all, the phonetic units of the world’s languages.
By 12 months of age, a perceptual narrowing process
is well under way: Infants’ sensitivity to native speech
sounds increases, and their sensitivity to non-native
(foreign
language)
speech
sounds
decreases
(Kuhl,
Stevens, Hayashi, Deguchi, Kiritani et al., 2006; Tsao,
Liu & Kuhl, 2004; Werker & Tees, 1984). While the

abilities
between 6 and 12 months of age is not complete,
and is somewhat dependent on the exact contrasts and
the relationship between the native and non-native
languages
under
investigation
(Best
&
McRoberts,
2003; Werker & Curtin, 2005; Kuhl et al., 2008),
studies
consistently
show
a
steep
decline
in
the
discrimination of non-native speech sounds by the
child’s first birthday.
Whether and how this critical transition is affected
by dual language exposure is still a matter of debate.
Some studies suggest that bilingual infants follow a
different developmental trajectory, while others claim
that the same general pattern is followed. Bosch and
Sebasti�
an-Gall�
es (2003a) tested Spanish and Catalan
monolingual and bilingual 4-, 8-, and 12-month-old
infants
on a vowel contrast that is phonemic
in
Catalan but not in Spanish. All groups discriminated
the
contrast
at
4 months
of
age.
However,
only
Catalan
monolingual
infants
were
successful
at
8 months of age. By 12 months, the bilingual group
was successful as well. The same U-shaped develop-
mental pattern was later shown for consonants (Bosch
& Sebasti�
an-Gall�
es, 2003b), as well as for vowels that
are contrastive in both languages (Sebasti�
an-Gall�
es &
Bosch,
2009).
Together,
these
studies
suggest
that
differences may exist between monolingual and bilin-
gual development of speech perception. The proposed
explanation
is
that
tracking
statistical
regularities
across two languages affects the ability to discriminate
acoustically similar phonetic categories.
Other studies have not replicated this pattern. For
example, Sundara, Polka, and Molnar (2008) show
that 10–12-month-old French-English bilingual babies
are
able
to
behaviorally
discriminate
French
and
English consonants and vowels, while age-matched
French monolinguals are unable to do so. Along
similar lines, Spanish-English 4- and 8-month-olds can
discriminate acoustically similar vowel contrasts that
are phonemic in one but not the other language
(Sundara & Scutellaro, 2011). A study by Burns,
Yoshida, Hill and Werker (2007) tested English- and
French-relevant voice-onset-time (VOT) consonant dis-
crimination
in
6–8-,
10–12-,
and
14–20-month-old
English
monolingual
and
French-English
bilingual
infants. While bilingual infants of all three age groups
were able to discriminate contrasts in both languages,
only the youngest group of monolinguals discriminated
both contrasts.
Taken together, the results of studies on bilingual
sound discrimination in infancy have so far been mixed,
perhaps due to differences in methodologies and the
characteristics of languages under investigation. Further
insights into this question can be gained by the use of
neuroimaging or brain recordings. The transition from
universal to native language specific phonetic discrimi-
nation is typically measured with the mismatch response
(MMR; N€
a€
at€
anen, Lehtokoski, Lennes, Cheour, Huoti-
lainen et al., 1997), which consists of two distinct
components. The early component, typically occurring
between 100 and ~260 ms post stimulus, signals a less
mature, acoustic level of neural encoding and discrim-
ination. The late component, with a typical latency of
~260–460 ms post stimulus, signals a more mature,

(Friedrich,
Herold
&
Friederici, 2009; Rivera-Gaxiola, Silva-Pereyra & Kuhl,
2005; Shafer, Yu & Datta, 2010, 2011).1 As infants
transition from universal to native language specific
phonetic discrimination, the late MMR component
shows a selective increase to native language sounds.
At the same time, the early MMR component in
response to native and non-native sounds decreases,
reflecting the decline in universal discrimination ability
(Kuhl et al., 2008). This pattern of results has been
replicated in a number of electroencephalography (EEG)
studies with monolingual infants (Rivera-Gaxiola, Gar-
cia-Sierra, Lara-Ayala, Cadena, Jackson-Maldonado
et al., 2012; Rivera-Gaxiola et al., 2005; Kuhl et al.,
2008). The transition from universal to native language
specific phonetic discrimination, with the accompanying
increase in the late MMR and decrease in the early
MMR component, typically occurs by 11 months of age.
Since most of this research has been conducted with
EEG, which lacks spatial resolution, the areas of the
infant brain involved in this process are still under
investigation. Two recent MEG studies suggest the
involvement of bilateral temporal, fronto-temporal, and
motor areas (Imada, Garcia-Sierra, Lara-Ayala, Cadena,
Jackson-Maldonado et al., 2006; Kuhl, Ram�
ırez, Bos-
seler, Lin & Imada, 2014).
Very few brain studies of speech discrimination have
so far been conducted with bilingual infants. Shafer et al.
(2011) recorded EEGs associated with English vowel
contrasts in monolingual English and bilingual Spanish-
English 3- to 36-month-olds. In monolinguals, the early
MMR component decreased in amplitude with increas-
ing age and language experience, as has previously been
shown in other studies. Bilingual infants showed a
different pattern of results, with a large late MMR,
which the authors interpreted as indexing increased
attentional demands experienced by bilingual infants.
Petitto, Berens, Kovelman, Dubins, Jasinska et al. (2012)
used functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS)
with 4–6- and 10–12-month-old bilingual and monolin-
gual infants as they processed native language sounds,
non-native language sounds, and non-linguistic tones.
Whole-brain analyses revealed that all infants showed
greater activations to language stimuli relative to non-
linguistic tones; however, there were no significant
differences between native and non-native language
conditions, or between activations in the right and left
hemisphere in either the monolingual or the bilingual
group. Region of Interest (ROI) analyses in the left
inferior frontal cortex showed that there were no
differences between the younger (4–6-month-old) bilin-
gual and monolingual group. However, an important
difference emerged between the two older groups: While
10–12-month-old bilingual infants showed neural sensi-
tivity to native and non-native phonetic contrasts, their
monolingual peers exhibited sensitivity to native pho-
netic contrasts only. The authors conclude that mono-
lingual and bilingual babies follow the same overarching
developmental trajectory; however, the bilingual babies
have a residual capacity to neurally discriminate foreign
language contrasts at a time when monolingual infants
can no longer do so.
This finding suggests that bilingual infants may
remain in the universal phonetic discrimination phase
for a longer period of time compared to monolingual
infants, in agreement with the results of an EEG study by
Garcia-Sierra,
Rivera-Gaxiola,
Percaccio,
Conboy,
Romo et al. (2011). The study used a double oddball
paradigm with Spanish and English sounds to show that
6–9-month-old Spanish-English bilingual infants do not
neurally discriminate either one of the languages, and
exhibit predominantly positive (less mature) rather than
negative (more mature) MMR responses. While no
monolingual infants participated in the study, other
studies using the same stimuli and paradigm show that
monolingual 6–8-month-old infants typically exhibit
neural discrimination of native and non-native contrasts
(Rivera-Gaxiola et al., 2005; Rivera-Gaxiola, Silva-
Pereyra, Klarman, Garcia-Sierra, Lara-Ayala et al.,
2007).
Importantly,
the
10–12-month-old
bilingual
infants in the Garcia-Sierra study showed discrimination
of both languages, as evidenced by a negative MMR in
response to both contrasts. Consequently, Garcia-Sierra
et al. (2011) argue that, while these data do not indicate a
developmental delay by bilingual infants, they do suggest
an extended universal sound discrimination phase.
Together, behavioral and brain studies suggest that
bilingual and monolingual speech perception are similar
in many ways; however, important differences have also
been observed. One plausible hypothesis is that the
transition from universal to native language specific
phonetic discrimination occurs later in development in
bilingual compared to monolingual infants (Kuhl, 2004;
Kuhl & Rivera-Gaxiola, 2008; Garcia-Sierra et al.,
2011). Bilingual infants split their time between two
languages. If the amount of time required to transition
from universal to language specific listening depends on
language input and variability, bilingual infants may stay
1 In the EEG literature, these two components are known as the
pMMR and nMMR, where p and n stand for positive and negative, and
refer to the polarity of the EEG response. MEG measures the magnetic
flux passing through a sensor surface, and its polarity depends on the
direction of the magnetic field relative to this sensor area. The two
components are thus defined by specific time windows, rather than by
polarity.

Speech discrimination in bilingual and monolingual infants

 in the universal listening stage for a longer period of time
compared to monolingual infants, simply because it
takes more time for sufficient data (speech) to be
experienced. If this prediction is correct, one should be
able to observe reliable differences in neural processing
between monolingual and bilingual infants by their first
birthday.
To test this hypothesis, the present study used, for the
first time in bilingual infant research, whole head
magnetoencephalography (MEG), which presents an
important advantage over previous EEG or fNIRS
studies. MEG and EEG both indicate the summed
response of the neuronal postsynaptic electric current;
however, MEG is more sensitive to neuromagnetic
signals perpendicular to the cortical surface. While
EEG and MEG both provide excellent temporal resolu-
tion (unlike hemodynamic techniques such as fNIRS or
fMRI), MEG also offers excellent spatial resolution
because the magnetic signal is left nearly intact by the
conductivity gradients as it travels through the brain and
skull tissue (Dale & Halgren, 2001). On the other hand,
the EEG signal distribution is very sensitive to fine
details of the conductivity boundaries in the head.
Using MEG technology, we directly compared the
locus and timing of neural activity between eight
Spanish-English bilingual and eight English monolin-
gual 11-month-olds. Using a double oddball paradigm,
we calculated the MMR for English and Spanish and
compared them at the within- and the between-group
levels in two time windows (100–260 ms and 260–
460 ms) identified in a number of previous studies (for
example, Cheour, Ceponiene, Lehtokoski, Luuk, Allik
et al., 1998; Conboy & Kuhl, 2011; for review see
N€
a€
at€
anen, Paavilainen, Rinne & Alho, 2007). Because
this is an initial MEG investigation with bilingual
infants, statistical analyses were conducted across the
entire brain surface, without any a priori hypotheses
about localization differences between the two groups.
This design allowed us to test three specific predictions:
First, we predicted that monolingual infants would show
a stronger English than Spanish MMR in the late
window, replicating previous EEG work (Rivera-Gaxiola
et al., 2005; Rivera-Gaxiola et al., 2007; Rivera-Gaxiola
et al., 2012; Kuhl et al., 2008). Based on previous infant
MEG research on speech perception (Imada et al., 2006;
Kuhl et al., 2014), we predicted that we would observe
this effect in bilateral fronto-temporal and motor areas,
but also expected to see the involvement of other brain
regions. We hypothesized that the bilingual group would
exhibit no differences between Spanish and English in
the late time window, indicating their equal phonetic
sensitivity to both languages. Second, we predicted that
bilingual, but not monolingual, infants would show a
stronger early MMR in response to English compared to
Spanish. The English contrast is acoustically more
salient. However, in infants who have already transi-
tioned from universal to native language specific speech
discrimination (as we hypothesized to be the case for the
monolingual group), this component typically decreases
by 11 months of age. Because of the acoustic nature of
the early response, we predicted that this effect would
map to brain areas related to auditory processing (i.e.
temporal cortex). Third, at the between-group level, we
predicted stronger brain responses to Spanish sounds in
the bilingual compared to the monolingual group,
reflecting the fact that Spanish is a native language for
bilinguals, but not monolinguals. We had no specific
predictions as to the location of this effect.
Methods
Participants
Sixteen bilingual and 17 monolingual 11-month-old
infants participated in the study. Participants were
recruited through the University of Washington Subject
Pool or flyers handed out at public libraries and
community centers. For the bilingual infants, criteria
for participation included regular exposure to English
and Spanish through interactions with native speaker(s)
from birth. For the monolingual group, participation
criteria included no regular exposure to languages other
than English. Language exposure was initially assessed
over the phone. Parents were asked to assess the
approximate amount of time their child spends listening
to English, Spanish, and any other languages. For the
bilingual group, families were invited to the laboratory
only if the parents confirmed that their child hears a
comparable amount of English and Spanish on a day-to-
day basis, and is not exposed to any other languages. For
the monolingual group, only infants whose parents
confirmed no significant exposure to languages other
than English were invited to participate. If the MEG
procedure was successful, parents of bilingual and
monolingual children were asked to fill out a language
background questionnaire (details below).
The infants had no reported hearing or neurological
problems, no history of ear infections, were born full-
term (between 39 and 42 weeks gestational age), and had
typical birth weight (between 6 and 10 lbs). Data from
seven bilingual and five monolingual infants were
rejected due to fussiness resulting in excessive noise
(see Averaging and Rejection below). Four additional
monolingual infants and one additional bilingual infant
were excluded due to technical difficulties. The mean age

 and standard deviation after rejection was as follows:
350 � 24 days for eight bilingual infants (five girls),
347 � 19 days for eight monolingual infants (four girls).
Written informed consent in accordance with the Human
Subjects Division at the University of Washington was
obtained from the parents.
Socioeconomic status (SES)
The bilingual and the monolingual groups were matched
on SES as measured by the Hollingshead scale (Holling-
shead, 1975), the most widely used index of SES. Based
on parental education, occupation, and marital status,
the Hollingshead scale generates a number between 10
and 66. In the bilingual group, the SES scores ranged
between 28 and 66 with a mean and standard deviation
of 50.8 � 15.2. In the monolingual group, the SES
scores ranged between 25 to 61 with a mean and
standard deviation of 48.8 � 14.4. This means that the
bilingual and monolingual participants came from fairly
diverse SES backgrounds. While the average bilingual
and monolingual SES scores are fairly high, some
children were from families of high SES and some were
from families of lower SES in both groups.
Language exposure assessment
If the MEG procedure was successful, parents were
asked to fill out a language background questionnaire
which included questions about exposure to English and
other languages that infants received from each of the
parents, siblings, extended family members, other adults
living in the home, daycare providers, and radio or
television. Six out of eight bilingual children who were
included in the analyses heard English from one native-
speaking parent and Spanish from the other native-
speaking parent. Children’s exposure to each language
was about equal, with total exposure to Spanish ranging
from 40% of the time to 65% of the time. One bilingual
child had parents who spoke only English, but had a
native Spanish-speaking nanny who had been watching
him from birth, for 10–12 hours Monday–Friday. One
bilingual child had parents who spoke only Spanish, but
was enrolled full-time in an English-only daycare from
the time she was 6 weeks old. None of the monolingual
infants had any significant exposure to languages other
than English.
Stimuli
Rivera-Gaxiola et al. (2005) created three consonant-
vowel syllables that were used in a double oddball
paradigm. The paradigm uses a phonetic unit common
to English and Spanish as a standard sound, and two
deviant sounds, one exclusive to English, and one
exclusive to Spanish. The standard sound was a voiceless
alveolar unaspirated stop, which is perceived as /da/ in
English and as /ta/ in Spanish. The English deviant was a
voiceless aspirated alveolar stop (/tha/). The Spanish
deviant was a prevoiced alveolar stop (/da/). The stimuli
were naturally produced by a female Spanish/English
bilingual speaker. Their duration was 230 ms.
Experimental design
A double oddball paradigm was used. The standard
sound was presented on 80% of the trials. Deviants
appeared in a pseudo-random fashion (no more than
three standards in a row could be presented) and were
each presented on 10% of the trials. The stimulus onset
asynchrony (SOA) was 1200 ms, consistent with previ-
ous infant studies using the same paradigm (Rivera-
Gaxiola et al., 2005; Bosseler, Taulu, Pihko, M€
akel€
a,
Imada et al., 2013; Kuhl et al., 2014).
Experimental procedure
To prepare the infants for testing, a lightweight nylon
cap containing five head position estimation (HPI) coils
was placed on the infants’ heads. The locations of the
HPI coils with respect to the head as well as additional
points to determine the head surface were digitized with
the Polhemus Fastrack digitizer (Colchester, VT, USA).
The number of additional points varied but was typically
in the range of 50–150. During recordings, HPI coils
were activated continuously to generate alternating
magnetic fields at frequencies between 80 and 321 Hz,
and were used to track the infants’ head positions during
the recordings. Infants were placed in a custom-made
adjustable chair that made it easy to adjust their height
under the MEG sensor array for an optimal position for
MEG
recording
(Figure 1).
During
recordings,
an
assistant waved toys silently in front of the infants to
entertain them. A silent video played in the background
throughout the 18-minute session. There were variable
amounts of head movement throughout the recording
sessions. The head position-tracking algorithm followed
by mathematical head position standardization allowed
us to compensate for movement and to reject epochs
with excessive movement (see Averaging and Rejection
below).
MEG measurement
MEG was recorded using a 306-channel Elekta Neuro-
mag� system at the University of Washington’s Institute

 for Learning & Brain Sciences (I-LABS). The system
contains 102 magnetometers and 204 gradiometers. The
magnetometers measure the magnetic flux through their
superconducting pickup loops while the gradiometers
measure the spatial difference of the flux through two
oppositely wound pickup loops, located side by side. The
MEG sensors are not referenced and the convention is to
plot the positive flux up and negative flux down. MEG
signals were continuously recorded with analog band-
pass filtering (0.03–650 Hz) and sampled at 2 KHz.
Preprocessing
MEG data were preprocessed using in-house Matlab
software and MaxFilter (Elekta-Oy). All data were
downsampled to 500 Hz, preprocessed using temporal
signal space separation (tSSS) and head movement
compensation transformed to the mean head position to
minimize reconstruction error (Taulu, Kajola & Simola,
2004; Taulu & Hari, 2009). It was inevitable that there was
some movement by the infant subject, the parent, or the
assistant inside the magnetically shielded room, poten-
tially causing movement-related magnetic interference.
This rendered the application of tSSS very important for
the study. For group-averaged waveform analyses, all
subjects were transformed to mean head position of each
group (bilinguals and monolinguals). Automatic cardiac
artifact suppression with signal space projection (SSP)
was applied, and further band-pass filtering (1–40 Hz).
Averaging and rejection
Data were epoched with respect to the onset of each
stimulus (�100–700 ms) and averaged by condition
(English
deviant, Spanish deviant, standard before
English deviant, and standard before Spanish deviant)
for each bilingual and monolingual subject. Data were
baseline corrected (�100–0 ms). Epochs were rejected
when the infant’s head position could not be located
with the MaxFilter software, or when peak-to-peak
amplitude was over 3 pT/cm (gradiometers) and 4 pT
(magnetometers). The number of epochs was equalized
across conditions by random uniform sampling to match
the condition with the minimum number of epochs, and
subjects with fewer than 75 epochs were rejected. Grand
group averages were created by averaging all bilingual
epoched data and all monolingual epoched data. The
averaged sensor-level signals were inspected by compar-
ing the waveforms after the stimulus onset to the
baseline. The noise level of the evoked response was
quantified by calculating the standard deviation of the
MEG signal in the pre-stimulus baseline period. This
procedure was performed separately for each MEG
channel and the signal-to-noise ratio was determined by
comparing the peak amplitude value of the post-stimulus
response to the baseline standard deviation, i.e. the
estimated noise level. Only subjects that had evoked
response amplitudes at least twice as large as two times
the standard deviation value of the baseline were
included in the analysis to ensure reliable analysis.
Anatomical and forward modeling
A template source space made of both cortical surfaces
(~20,484 source points with a median edge of 3 mm) and
subcortical volumes (~6007 source points with a grid
spacing of 5 mm) was constructed from the Freesurfer
segmentation of an MRI of one 14-month-old subject.
Forward modeling was done using the Boundary Ele-
ment Method (BEM). The source space and the BEM
surface were aligned and warped to optimally fit each
subject’s digitized head points using the head model’s
scalp surface. All modeling was done with in-house
Matlab
software,
the
Neuroelectromagnetic
Source
Analysis (NSA) Toolbox, and Freesurfer (Destrieux,
Fischl, Dale & Halgren, 2010).
Source analysis
Source analysis was done with the sLORETA inverse
algorithm (Pascual-Marqui, 2002) without dipole orien-
tation constraints using gradiometers and magnetome-
ters. The sLORETA activity estimate is similar to the
minimum-L2-norm solution, except that it is normalized
using the resolution matrix to achieve zero localization
bias (i.e. the maximum of each estimated point-spread

 function is located at the true location of each modeled
dipole). The noise covariance was computed from the
pre-stimulus time period (�100–0 ms) of all accepted
trials. The SNR was assumed to be 3, and the noise
regularization parameter was set to SNR�2 (i.e. 1/9). A
global scaling of sLORETA values was performed on
each subject based on the pre-stimulus period of all
conditions. All statistical analyses focused on the English
and Spanish MMR. The MMR at each source point and
time point was calculated by taking the L2-norm (i.e. the
square root of the sum of the squares) of the vector
difference between the deviant and corresponding stan-
dard three-dimensional sLORETA activity vectors (i.e.
in the x, y, and z directions). These were defined as the
English MMR (native for both groups) and the Spanish
MMR (native for the bilingual group, non-native for the
monolingual group).
Statistical analyses
Group-level inferences at the cortical source level were
conducted with spatiotemporal threshold-free cluster
enhancement (TFCE), an extension of TFCE (Smith &
Nichols, 2009) that uses spatiotemporal instead of spatial
connectivity. Here, we used height and extent exponents
of 2 and integrated from an alpha value of 1, for two
separate time windows. Previous EEG studies have shown
that the MMR in infants and young children consists of
two distinct components signaling different neural pro-
cesses. A recent analysis of each 20 ms interval between
100 ms and 600 ms post stimulus suggests that the early
component extends up to 260 ms in young children
(Shafer et al., 2010). Other studies suggest that the late
component typically spans the 250–450 ms time window
(see Cheour et al., 1998; Conboy & Kuhl, 2011; Shafer
et al., 2010). Based on these findings, the time windows of
100–260 and 260–460 were selected for statistical analyses
of the early and late component, respectively.
TFCE involves a sequence of steps. First, the mean and
variance multivariate time series are computed across
subjects. These are then used to compute the t-value
multivariate time series, which is then spatiotemporally
enhanced resulting in the TFCE time series. Our TFCE
approach enhances spatiotemporally connected sources
(i.e. source regions that are locally connected in both
space and time). Like cluster-level inference, TFCE
increases the sensitivity of finding the true signal of
spatiotemporally extended sources, but avoids having to
select an arbitrary primary cluster-inducing threshold,
thereby allowing inference to be made at the voxel level
and single time sample level, albeit after the spatiotem-
poral enhancement. These voxelwise values represent the
amount of cluster-like local spatial and temporal support.
Family-wise error rate (FWER) control was per-
formed with permutation tests using the empirical
permutation distribution of the maximum spatiotempo-
ral TFCE statistic. This is equivalent to the procedure
performed for spatial TFCE in fMRI research using the
maximum spatial TFCE statistic, or for cluster-level
inference using the maximum mass or cluster size
statistic. For one-sample paired permutation tests, the
sign of each subject’s source activity difference was
randomly assigned (i.e. a 2N permutation sample space,
where N is the number of subjects), whereas for two-
sample permutation tests, the group labels were ran-
domly assigned (i.e. 4000 Monte Carlo samples were
taken from the N! permutation sample space). FWER
corrected p-values were obtained using inverse per-
centiles from the null permutation distribution of the
maximum TFCE statistic.
Region of Interest (ROI) analysis
A bilateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal ROI was obtained
by letting a seed vertex iteratively grow based on the mesh
connectivity of the high-resolution template cortical
surfaces in the left and right cortical surfaces separately.
The areas selected for ROI analyses were carefully chosen
to include brain regions known to be involved in executive
function skills (Goldman-Rakic, 1996; Fuster, Bodner &
Kroger, 2000). These areas have previously been shown to
be active during language switching and selection in
bilingual adults (Buchweitz & Prat, 2013; Price, Green &
von Studnitz, 1999; Stocco & Prat, 2014; Hernandez,
Dapretto, Mazziotta & Bookheimer, 2001). The scaled
sLORETA activity of each subject was averaged across all
source points belonging to the ROI. An ROI two-sample
t-test was computed at each time sample within the two
time windows of analyses (100–260 ms and 260–460 ms)
to examine the between-group differences in neural
activation for the Spanish and the English MMR. False
discovery rate (FDR) control (q-value<0.05) was used to
correct for multiple hypotheses testing across time in the
two temporal windows separately (Genovese, Lazar &
Nichols, 2002).

bilingual infants that used the same stimuli (Conboy &
Kuhl, 2011; Garcia-Sierra et al., 2011; Rivera-Gaxiola
et al., 2005).
Threshold free cluster enhancement
Statistical analyses using spatiotemporal TFCE were
conducted in two time windows (an early window of
100–260 ms
post stimulus
and a late, window of
260–460 ms post stimulus), at the within- and between-
group levels. All reported p-values are the minimum
corrected p-values for all source points across either the
early or the late window.
Within group analyses
Within each group, we examined the differences in neural
activation for the Spanish and the English MMR.
Monolinguals. In the early time window, the difference
between the English MMR and the Spanish MMR was
not significant (p = .15). In the late time window, the
English MMR was significantly larger than the Spanish
MMR (p = .004). This pattern of results replicates
previous EEG studies (Kuhl et al., 2008; Rivera-Gaxiola
et al., 2005), and indicates phonetic sensitivity to English
and a lack of phonetic sensitivity to Spanish. As shown
in Figure 3, the differences between the Spanish and the
English MMR were widespread over the right hemi-
sphere superior and medial temporal gyrus, superior
temporal sulcus, inferior frontal gyrus, ventromedial
prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, dorsolateral pre-
frontal cortex, and the sensori-motor speech area. Left
frontal and orbitofrontal areas were also involved, but to
a lesser extent.
Bilinguals. The bilingual group showed the opposite
pattern of results. In the early time window, the
English MMR was significantly larger than the Span-
ish MMR (p = .04). As shown in Figure 4, this effect
mapped predominantly to the left superior and middle
temporal gyrus, the left superior temporal sulcus, the
left sensori-motor speech area, and the parahippocam-
pal gyrus. In the late time window the differences
between the English and the Spanish MMR were not
significant (p = .29).
Between-group analyses
We examined the differences between monolingual and
bilingual infants in neural activation separately for the
English MMR and for the Spanish MMR.
English MMR. The two groups did not differ in their
neural activation for the English MMR in the early
(p = .81) or in the late (p = .63) time window. These
results indicate that the two groups are equally sensitive
to English.
Spanish MMR. In the early time window, the bilingual
group showed a stronger neural response compared to
the monolingual group (p = .04). In the late time
window, the difference between the two groups was
marginally significant (p = .08), again in the direction of

Region of Interest (ROI) analysis
In a bilateral prefrontal ROI, we examined between-
group differences in neural activation for the English and
the Spanish MMR in the early and late time windows.
For the English MMR, no significant between-group
differences were observed. For the Spanish MMR, the
bilingual group again showed significantly stronger
neural activity than the monolingual group (q < 0.05).

Speech discrimination in bilingual and monolingual infants

 As indicated in Figure 6, significant differences were
found in both time windows.
Discussion
Speech perception begins as a universal process, wherein
infants initially discriminate all phonetic contrasts in the
world’s languages, and then, through social interaction
and consistent exposure to speech, become specialized in
perceiving the sounds of native language (Best &
McRoberts, 2003; Kuhl et al., 2008; Werker & Hensch,
2015; Werker & Tees, 1984). Using whole head MEG, the
present study compared the neural underpinnings of
phonetic narrowing in Spanish-English bilingual and
English monolingual 11-month-olds. In a double oddball
paradigm, differences between the English and the
Spanish MMR were examined at the within- and
between-group levels in an early and a late time window.
The participating infants were 11 months old. At this
age, monolingual infants are known to have already
transitioned from universal to native language specific
phonetic processing (Rivera-Gaxiola et al., 2005; Rivera-
Gaxiola et al., 2012; Kuhl et al., 2008; Imada et al., 2006;
Kuhl et al., 2014; Best, McRoberts, & Goodell, 2001;
Polka, & Werker, 1994). Using a novel method, we
sought to replicate this finding, and examined whether
and how the bilingual infants may differ from their
monolingual peers. The monolingual group was hypoth-
esized to show neural evidence of phonetic narrowing
and selective sensitivity to English in the late analysis
window. The bilingual group, on the other hand, was
hypothesized to show equal sensitivity to both languages
in the late analysis window, and increased sensitivity to
English, the more salient contrast, in the early analysis
window.
The MEG results support our hypotheses. In the late,
but not in the early, window the monolingual group
showed a significantly stronger English than Spanish
MMR. This is in agreement with results of previous
EEG studies, which show that between 6 and 11 months
of age, as infants transition from universal to native
language specific speech discrimination, the late (pho-
netic)
MMR
shows a selective increase to native
language sounds, while the early (acoustic) MMR
component decreases. This transition has been termed
‘native language neural commitment’ (NLNC; Kuhl,
2004), and has been replicated in English- and Spanish-
learning monolingual children between 6 and 11 months
of age (Rivera-Gaxiola et al., 2005; Rivera-Gaxiola
et al., 2012; Kuhl et al., 2014). The NLNC model argues
that, between 6 and 11 months of age, learning of the
acoustic and statistical regularities of ambient speech
alters the responsiveness of the infant brain. Specifically,
as infants experience a sufficient amount of native
language
input,
processing
becomes
automatic,
as
indexed by a decrease in lower-level (acoustic) sound
analyses and an increase in higher-level (phonetic) sound
analysis. Our current results advance previous EEG
findings by identifying the brain areas involved in this
critical transition. Our findings suggest the involvement
of a wide range of bilateral brain areas, with a significant
right hemisphere bias. A number of studies with adult
participants indicate that both hemispheres participate in

Shtyrov et al., 2005). In our paradigm, syllables were
presented in a stream, without any context. Further-
more, young preverbal infants do not yet have a large
and reliable lexicon to help them contextualize sounds in
a stream of syllables, which could further explain the
observed right hemisphere bias. Previous EEG research
suggests that the left hemisphere specialization for
speech emerges slowly over development, as the size
and efficiency of the lexicon increases (Mills, Plunkett,
Prat & Schafer, 2005). The rightward asymmetry that we
observed could also arise as a result of infants’ increased
sensitivity to prosodic features of speech. To this end,

 prosodic contours, is known to be tightly coupled to
advanced development of speech in the first years of life
(Ram�
ırez-Esparza et al., 2014). Future longitudinal and
cross-sectional studies should explore when and how the
neural processing of phonemes becomes more left
lateralized over development.
In contrast to the monolingual group, the bilingual
group showed no differences between the English and
the Spanish MMR in the late MMRwindow. In the early
window, however, they showed a stronger English
compared to Spanish MMR. These results indicate that
the bilingual infants neurally discriminate between the
two languages, but only at the acoustic level, as signaled
by the early MMR component. An equally strong late
MMR response to Spanish and English can be inter-
preted as signaling equal phonetic sensitivity to both
languages, as one would predict based on infants’ dual
language exposure. A stronger early MMR to English
likely reflects the fact that the English contrast is
perceptually more salient as it involves aspiration (Gar-
cia-Sierra et al., 2011). As previously suggested, the early
MMR component reflects a less specialized, universal
acoustic detection process that plays a prominent role in
the early stages of speech discrimination, but then
decreases over time as processing becomes more auto-
matic (Shafer et al., 2010; Rivera-Gaxiola et al., 2005).
Confirming its lower-level, acoustic nature, the observed
differences mapped onto left hemisphere superior tem-
poral cortex, the seat of auditory processing. The
involvement of these areas in speech processing has
previously been observed in infants and adults (Kuhl
et al., 2014; Price, Wise, Warburton, Moore, Howard
et al., 1996). Note that although the English voicing
contrast is highly salient, no differences in the acoustic
MMR were observed in the monolingual group. We
interpret these results as confirming our previous finding
that the monolingual, but not the bilingual, infants have
transitioned from lower-level (acoustic) to higher-level
(phonetic) discrimination.
The transition to native language specific listening at
the end of the first year of life is known to predict
subsequent milestones in language acquisition. For
example, monolingual infants who show a strong late
(phonetic) MMR response to native language sounds at
11 months of age exhibit rapid advances in the acqui-
sition of words and sentences (Kuhl et al., 2008). By
contrast, an enhanced or prolonged acoustic MMR
component has been associated with poorer language
skills at 2 or 3 years of age (Friedrich et al., 2009; Weber,
Hahne, Friedrich & Friederici, 2004). The current results
suggest that an extended acoustic sound analysis may
also be part of the typical developmental trajectory in
bilingual infants. However, we emphasize that this does
not mean that bilingual language acquisition is ‘delayed’
or ‘deviant’ in any way. Instead, we propose that
remaining in the universal listening stage indicates a
highly adaptive brain response, and a distinct advantage
in a situation when two languages are being mapped
simultaneously.
The results of the present study, like previous EEG
work from our laboratory (Garcia-Sierra et al., 2011),
suggest that the neural encoding of two languages takes a
longer time compared to the encoding of a single
language. Given the continuity in language development,
an extended acoustic sound analysis phase that we
observed in the bilingual group may be related to the
well-documented gap between bilingual and monolin-
gual children on measures of lexical and grammatical
growth (Oller & Eilers, 2002; Mahon & Crutchley, 2006;
Portocarrero, Burright & Donovick, 2007). However, it is
important to emphasize that bilingual infants and
children only lag behind their monolingual peers when
a single language is considered; on measures that
combine both languages, bilinguals perform equally to
or better than age-matched monolingual peers (Pearson,
Fern�
andez & Oller, 1993; Hoff, Core, Place, Rumiche,
Se~
nor et al., 2012). The neural differences between
bilingual and monolingual infants that we observed here,
although significant and non-trivial, should also be
interpreted in light of the fact that the bilingual group is
simultaneously encoding an additional repertoire of
phonemes. With this important distinction in mind, the
observed similarities between the two groups are perhaps
even more impressive than the differences. For example,
we found no significant between-group differences in
either acoustic or phonetic discrimination of English.
Thus, despite still showing evidence of acoustic discrim-
ination between English and Spanish, the bilingual
group, when directly compared to the monolingual
group, does not lag behind on the neural encoding of
English. Most crucially, the bilingual group is simulta-
neously also encoding the sounds of Spanish. In a direct
between-group comparison, the bilingual group showed
a stronger Spanish MMR in the acoustic window, and a
marginally stronger Spanish MMR in the phonetic
window, suggesting that they are well on their way to
encoding the phonetic categories for Spanish sounds.
Together, these results suggest that the encoding of two
languages does take a longer time compared to the
encoding of a single language; however, it does not take
twice as long.
Most importantly, our results support the notion that,
besides the obvious benefit of acquiring another lan-
guage, exposure to two languages in infancy may be
related to other cognitive advantages. Specifically, we
found evidence that bilingual, but not monolingual,

functioning. Enhancements in executive function skills
have been consistently shown in bilinguals throughout
the lifespan. For example, 7- and 12-month-old infants
from bilingual families have been shown to be more
flexible learners of speech structures (Kovacs & Mehler,
2009a, 2009b). Bilingual toddlers exhibit a prolonged
period of flexibility in their interpretation of potential
word forms (Graf Estes & Hay, 2015). In bilingual
children, advantages have been shown on metalinguistic
tasks (Cromdal, 1999), switching tasks (Bialystok &
Martin, 2004), Stroop tasks (Martin-Rhee & Bialystok,
2008), and theory of mind tasks (Goetz, 2003). Bilingual
adults consistently outperform monolinguals on conflict
resolution and Stroop tasks (Bialystok, Craik & Luk,
2008). While it is important to acknowledge that some
studies have failed to find such enhancements (for
example, Paap & Greenberg, 2013), the bulk of research
is consistent with the idea that simultaneous exposure to
two languages results in advancements in executive
function skills in children and adults, and translates into
protective effects against cognitive decline with aging
(Bialystok, Craik & Freedman, 2007; for review see
Bialystok, 2011).
Enhancements in executive functioning in bilinguals
are thought to arise as a result of a constant need to
resolve conflict at the linguistic level, which then boosts
the ability to resolve non-linguistic conflict (Bialystok,
2009). Neuroimaging evidence with adult participants
shows that prefrontal and orbitofrontal regions are
activated when bilinguals are selecting or switching
languages (Hernandez et al., 2001; Price et al., 1999;
Stocco & Prat, 2014). Anatomical studies indicate a
series of connections between prefrontal cortex, anterior
cingulate, and orbitofrontal cortex, all of which are
known
to
be
involved
in
language
processing
in
bilinguals (Botvinick, Braver, Barch, Carter & Cohen,
2001; Bunge, Hazeltine, Scanlon, Rosen & Gabrieli,
2002). The organization of these networks is such that
the constant need to manage attention between the two
languages enhances bilingual executive control (Abu-
talebi & Green, 2007). The bilingual infants studied
here, when directly compared to monolingual infants,
showed significantly stronger Spanish MMRs in a
region of interest that was selected to include areas
known to be involved in executive functioning: namely,
the bilateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex. These
responses may be related to language switching and
selection, as has previously been shown in bilingual
adults (Hernandez et al., 2001; Price et al., 1999; Stocco
& Prat, 2014). Interestingly, between-group differences
in areas related to executive functioning were observed
despite the fact that the task involved merely listening
to a stream of syllables from both languages, at an age
when infants are just beginning to produce their first
words. Interestingly, executive function processes are
among the later cognitive skills to emerge in develop-
ment, which is typically attributed to the protracted
development of the prefrontal lobes (Casey, Tottenham,
Liston & Durston, 2005). The current results suggest,
however, that simultaneous exposure to two languages
and the constant need to resolve linguistic conflict in
infancy might boost the activity of these brain areas
during a time in development when other activities that
strengthen executive function skills may not yet be
frequently practiced.
Taken together, the results of the present study
indicate that, by 11 months of age, the infant brain
shows neural sensitivity to the language or languages
present in the environment: the monolingual brain is
committed to one language, and the bilingual brain
shows sensitivity to two. The results suggest that the
dual sensitivity of the bilingual brain may be achieved
by a slower transition from acoustic to phonetic sound
analysis. It is important to acknowledge that the
current results are based on a single time point in
development. It is, of course, possible and likely that
the
differences
between
bilingual
and
monolingual
speech processing change over time, and longitudinal
studies are critical to assess how monolingual and
bilingual children continue their language-learning tra-
jectory. Another variable that requires further study is
the role of SES on bilingual language acquisition. In
the present study, the monolingual and the bilingual
groups were carefully matched on SES, allowing us to
make between-group comparisons. While participating
children came from families of varying SES back-
grounds, the average SES was fairly high, unlike in
some other studies with bilingual infants (for example,
Garcia-Sierra et al., 2011). Future brain and behavioral
studies should examine the interaction between SES
and bilingualism in greater detail. The results of the
present study suggest that splitting the time between
two languages in early infancy results in an adaptive
and advantageous neural response to a greater variabil-
ity in language input. While remaining in a state of
heightened neural plasticity may cause slower growth of
each of the languages, it also leads to a heightened
sensitivity of the prefrontal cortex in responding to
speech sounds, which may be related to more efficient
cognitive resources for performing executive function
tasks. Thus, the experience of bilingualism appears to
alter not only the scope of language acquisition and
use, but also a broader scope of cognitive processing
from a very young age onward.
