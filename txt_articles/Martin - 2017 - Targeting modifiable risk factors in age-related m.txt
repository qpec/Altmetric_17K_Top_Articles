Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent to which ophthalmologists 
and optometrists in Sweden recommend the use of nutritional supplements, changes in diet, or 
smoking cessation to patients who are at risk of or with signs of age-related macular degenera-
tion (AMD). In addition, this study also examined how these practitioners rate the strength of 
evidence for nutritional supplements in AMD management and which sources of information 
they consult to determine supplement recommendations for the prevention or treatment of AMD.
Methods: This study implemented a cross-sectional design using data from a questionnaire. 
All Swedish optometrists and ophthalmologists who were registered in the membership data-
bases of their respective professional organizations were invited to participate. The question-
naire contained 18 forced choice questions and one free text question and was organized into 
the following four sections: use of nutritional supplements, dietary advice, smoking and eye 
diseases, and strength of evidence and the sources of information regarding nutritional supple-
ment interventions.
Results: The response rate was 40.3% for optometrists and 5% for ophthalmologists. Optom-
etrists were more likely than ophthalmologists to recommend nutritional supplements in AMD 
and provided significantly more advice about diet than did the ophthalmologists for both patients 
at risk for AMD and those with established disease. The ophthalmologists were more likely 
than the optometrists to rely on the findings from the age-related eye disease studies of AMD 
regarding treatment with and selection of supplements and to recommend smoking cessation.
Conclusion: Common evidence-based strategies for AMD management among eye care profes-
sionals would presumably be beneficial for AMD patients. Targeted education and implementa-
tion strategies may be needed.

Introduction
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) affects individuals above the age of 50 and is 
a major cause of severe visual impairment in older populations in industrial countries.1,2 
AMD is characterized by progressive destruction of the retinal pigment epithelial cells 
and photoreceptors3 due to low-grade inflammation, ischemia, and oxidative stress.4,5 
The natural defenses against oxidative stress involve antioxidants, either derived from 
the diet or from natural substances. High local concentrations of pigments such as 
lutein, zeaxanthin, and meso-zeaxanthin result in a yellow color in the macular region 
that can be observed when the retina is illuminated with light of certain wavelengths. 
Lutein and zeaxanthin are found in the typical diet in foods such as egg yolks, corn, 
fruit, and vegetables.6 Meso-zeaxanthin, however, can be acquired through dietary

sources and is also formed within the macula via lutein 
conversion.7 The macular pigment enhances image quality 
by absorbing short wavelength light and also protects the 
retinal nerve cells from phototoxic damage by free radicals.8
Results from the long-running age-related eye disease 
studies (AREDS) indicate that carotenoid and antioxidant 
supplements significantly reduce the risk of visual loss in 
patients with AMD.9 Such treatment in the form of dietary 
supplements can be recommended for patients with inter-
mediate and late AMD.10,11 However, the preventive effect 
of dietary supplementation was minor for those with early 
stage AMD,12 and no evidence has been presented to support 
routine nutritional supplementation for primary prevention.13 
Results from genomics studies of AMD patients have sug-
gested that gene-directed therapies could improve patient 
outcomes.14 However, this view has been disputed.9 Recently, 
Kijlstra and Berendschot15 suggested that AMD is a disease 
caused by hyperactive complement and thus should be clas-
sified as complementopathy and that nutrition may play a 
role in controlling the level of complement factor D in the 
circulation.
Addressing modifiable risk factors, such as smoking 
and nutrition, may improve AMD prevention.15 The associa-
tion between smoking and AMD has been known for many 
years,16,17 and even though there is convincing evidence that 
smoking is harmful, ~20% of the adult population continues 
to use cigarettes.18 Awareness regarding the effects of smok-
ing on vision is low,19 although cigarette smoking generates 
oxidative stress, decreases antioxidant protection, and results 
in the generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. 
Oxidative stress enhances disease onset in both the atrophic 
and neovascular forms of AMD,20 and a threefold increased 
risk of any type of AMD associated with current active 
smoking has been reported.21 Furthermore, smokers have 
a reduced intake of dietary antioxidants.22 Hence, smoking 
cessation should be the first recommendation given to patients 
at risk of or with AMD to prevent progression to late AMD.23 
Consumption of fruits and vegetables containing the two 
carotenoid pigments lutein and zeaxanthin6 may be linked 
to a reduced risk of AMD.24
Several studies have recently been performed in order to 
determine how these scientific findings have influenced eye 
care professionals to recommend nutritional supplements, 
changes in diet, or smoking cessation. In a European study 
of ophthalmologists from seven countries,25 the proportion of 
patients receiving nutritional supplements ranged from 53% 
to 78%. The rate of recommendation of nutritional supple-
ment was lowest in the UK and highest in Germany. The 
surveyed ophthalmologists were generally of the opinion that 
nutritional supplements were beneficial, at least during the 
early/intermediate-stage of AMD.25 Hence, dietary supple-
ment recommendations seem to be routine when managing 
AMD, at least among ophthalmologists in Belgium, France, 
Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and the UK, and the aware-
ness of the recent clinical studies in the field is high.25
However, ophthalmologists are not the only eye care 
professionals who meet patients at risk of or with AMD. In 
recent decades, optometrists in many countries have taken 
an increasing part of the care of patients at risk of or with 
age-related eye diseases. A study from Australia showed that 
less than two-thirds of optometrists routinely discussed diets 
with their patients and just over 50% inquired about patients’ 
use of nutritional supplements.26 Lawrenson and Evans con-
ducted a survey among optometrists and ophthalmologists 
in the UK and found that these eye care professionals were 
actively engaged in providing nutritional advice to their 
older patients with family histories of AMD and patients 
with advanced AMD.27
The aim of the current study was to investigate the extent 
to which ophthalmologists and optometrists in Sweden 
recommend the use of nutritional supplements, changes in 
diet, or smoking cessation to patients at risk of or with signs 
of AMD. This study also determined how practitioners rate 
the strength of evidence for nutritional supplements in AMD 
management and which sources of information they consult 
to create recommendations for nutritional supplements in the 
prevention or treatment of AMD.
Materials and methods
A cross-sectional survey was performed, delivered entirely 
online, and hosted by Netigate® (http://www.netigate.se). 
The survey was developed for a similar study in the UK,27 
translated into Swedish (the survey was also back translated 
to verify the accuracy of the translation), and piloted in a 
small group of optometrists and one ophthalmologist. An 
invitation to the ophthalmologists to take part in the survey 
was distributed as an advertisement in an electronic news-
letter from the Swedish Ophthalmological Society, which 
is periodically sent to all members (N≈900). All Swedish 
optometrists (N≈800) included in the membership databases 
of their professional organization were invited by email or 
via an advertisement in an electronic newsletter to participate 
in the online survey. Both invitations included a hyperlink 
to the same survey home page. No exclusion criteria were 
used, meaning that all ophthalmologists and optometrists 
in Sweden were invited, regardless of their sub-specialties.

Advice about AMD in optometric practice
Reminders to complete the survey were sent out twice via 
the respective organizations.
The survey contained 18 forced choice questions and one 
free text question and was organized into the following four 
sections: use of nutritional supplements, dietary advice, smok-
ing and eye diseases, and strength of evidence and the sources 
of information regarding nutritional supplement interventions. 
The respondents were presented with three patient scenarios 
of different age, heredity, and symptoms of AMD: 1) scenario 
A: 55-year-old patient with no signs of AMD but with one or 
more parents and/or siblings affected by AMD (i.e., a patient 
at risk for AMD), 2) scenario B: 65-year-old patient with 
advanced AMD in one eye and early AMD in the other, and 3) 
scenario C: 75-year-old patient with advanced AMD in both 
eyes. They were asked whether they would advise nutritional 
supplements for each specified patient, and if so to indicate 
which supplement they would recommend from a list of those 
commercially available in Sweden. The respondents were 
also questioned as to whether they would ask patients about 
their smoking habits and if they would recommend smoking 
cessation. The scenarios were chosen to reflect the available 
information about the value of nutritional supplementation in 
AMD and were adopted from a previous study by Lawrenson 
and Evans with their permission.27 The suggested supplement 
choices representing those available in Sweden included the 
following: 1) vitamins C and E and lutein, zeaxanthin, copper, 
and zinc (corresponding to the AREDS2 formula), 2) lutein, 
meso-zeaxanthin, and zeaxanthin, 3) vitamins A, B2, C, and 
E, and lutein, zeaxanthin, zinc, selenium, and copper, and 4) 
vitamins C and E and zinc, lutein, zeaxanthin, and omega-3 
fatty acids. In the last part of the questionnaire, the respon-
dents were asked to rate the strength of evidence to support the 
use of nutritional supplements in the prevention or treatment 
of AMD and which sources of information they consult to 
determine recommendations for nutritional supplements in 
AMD patients. The terminology adopted by the Grading of 
Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation 
(GRADE) working group28 for quality of evidence (high, 
moderate, low, or very low) was used. For a more detailed 
description of the questions, see Lawrenson and Evans.27 An 
incentive in the form of a prize draw for £100 in shopping 
vouchers was offered to those who completed the survey and 
voluntarily provided an email address. An informational email 
was sent to the participants, which contained an embedded 
link to the survey; this email informed them of the voluntary 
nature of their responses and that they could decline participa-
tion simply by not answering the survey. The email also stated 
that by answering the questionnaire, participants gave their 
informed consent. The respondents were also informed that 
their individual answers would be treated with confidentiality 
and would not be traceable to them or their health care unit.
The research was carried out in accordance with 
the Declaration of Helsinki (http://www.wma.net/
en/30publications/10policies/b3/index.html). According to 
the Swedish Law (2003: 460) for ethical review of research 
involving humans, no ethical approval was needed for this 
type of survey.
statistical analysis
The answers were presented as percentages of valid 
responses. Statistical analysis of differences between the 
ophthalmologists and the optometrists was performed using 
Fisher’s exact test and chi-square test.
Results
A total of 393 (full or partial) responses were received. Of 
these, 323 (87%) were from optometrists and 48 (13%) 
from ophthalmologists, which resulted in a response rate 
of ≈23%. The response rate of optometrists was 40.3% and 
ophthalmologists was 5%.
Recommendations for nutritional 
supplements
The Swedish optometrists were more likely to recommend 
micronutrient supplements for all scenarios than were the 
ophthalmologists. The largest difference regarding supplement 
recommendations was found in patients with no signs of AMD 
but with risk factors for the disease (see Table 1). A total of 
75% of the respondents reported that they would recommend 
nutritional supplements to a patient with advanced AMD in 
one eye and early AMD in the other. The optometrists were 
more likely to recommend supplements containing macular 
carotenoids only (54%), whereas the ophthalmologists recom-
mended supplements also containing vitamins and minerals 
according to the AREDS2 formula (67%).
Dietary advice to patients at risk of or 
with advanced AMD
The Swedish ophthalmologists were significantly more 
reluctant to provide dietary advice to patients with AMD than 
were the optometrists (Table 2). The most common advice 
given by both professionals was to increase consumption of 
green vegetables and oily fish to at least two times a week. 
Two-thirds of the ophthalmologists compared with one-third 
of the optometrists would never provide dietary advice to 
patients who only had risk factors for AMD.

Recommendations on smoking
Swedish ophthalmologists were significantly more likely to 
take a smoking history from their new patients than were the 
optometrists and to inform patients about the relationship 
between smoking and eye disease. The ophthalmologists were 
also significantly more likely to recommend that all of their 
patients quit smoking than were the optometrists (Table 3).
Rating the evidence for nutritional 
supplement recommendations in AMD 
and sources of information
The optometrists rated the strength of the evidence signifi-
cantly higher than did the ophthalmologists (Table 4) regard-
ing both the prevention and slowing of AMD progression.
Both the optometrists and ophthalmologists relied on 
conference presentations, expert opinions, and articles in 
peer-reviewed journals as the basis for their recommenda-
tions regarding nutritional supplements. Conference presen-
tations were most common (68% and 65%, respectively), 
and Cochrane reviews or bibliographic databases (Medline, 
PubMed) were used to a lesser extent by both groups of 
professionals. A total of 10% of the optometrists and 6% 
of the ophthalmologists did not use any of these sources. 
Other sources of information reported were information from 
manufacturers, university education and courses, Internet-
related sources, and reports from patients.
Discussion
The increasing life span in Europe has led a large number of 
patients to develop risks for age-related eye diseases, such as 
AMD. Targeting modifiable risk factors (e.g., smoking, diet, 
and nutrition) might represent a simple and cost-effective 
strategy to reduce the burden of disease29 as micronutrients 
have been shown to beneficially influence the course of 
AMD.9 In the current study, significant differences were 
observed between the reported practices of the participat-
ing optometrists and ophthalmologists regarding the use 
of micronutrients, with optometrists being more likely to 
recommend nutritional supplements than the ophthalmolo-
gists. According to AREDS, a patient with no signs of AMD 
but with risk factors for the disease will not benefit from 
using nutritional supplements.9 Nevertheless, half of the 
optometrists in the current study reported that they would 
recommend nutritional supplements to these patients. A 
patient with advanced AMD in one eye and early AMD in the 
other, who should be recommended supplements according 
to the results from the AREDS,9,11 would receive supplement 
recommendations from 67% of the ophthalmologists and 
54% of the optometrists in this study.

Advice about AMD in optometric practice
The Swedish respondents did not take smoking histories 
in new patients, provided advice regarding smoking, or 
recommended smoking cessation to the same extent as did 
the UK respondents,27 despite the fact that the proportions 
of smokers in the two countries are similar (UK 19.9% and 
Sweden 20.4%).18 Compared with the ophthalmologists, the 
Swedish optometrists were significantly less likely to ask 
their new patients about smoking and to inform them about 
the relationship between smoking and eye diseases and rec-
ommend smoking cessation. This might be explained by a 
perception that advice about smoking cessation is a form of 
medical care and primarily the responsibility of the general 
medical practitioner.26
At 16.7%, the prevalence of smoking is somewhat lower 
in Australia than in Sweden and the UK,18 yet almost half 
of Australian optometrists routinely ask their patients about 
their smoking habits.26 In Canada, optometrists do not rou-
tinely engage in tobacco use prevention and cessation prac-
tices, despite awareness of the impact of smoking on ocular 
health.30 A recent study from the UK showed that targeted 
educational intervention can change practice.31 Kennedy and 
Douglas32 stated that optometrists can have an important 
role in tobacco use prevention and cessation and presented 
several techniques and strategies that could be implemented 
in optometric practice. It has been reported that a majority 
of eye care providers desire additional training and resources 
to support smoking cessation.30,33
Swedish optometrists were also more reluctant in giving 
dietary advice than were UK optometrists, but when they 
did, more Swedish respondents recommended the intake 
of oily/fatty fish than did UK professionals.27 The so-called 
Nordic diet includes intake of fatty fish, which has been 
shown to increase the levels of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty 
acids in serum.34 However, the previous reported positive 
effect of dietary patterns35,36 and consumption of oily fish37,38 
in observational studies of AMD outcomes has not yet been 
supported by randomized controlled studies.39 In Australia, 
the most common reason for recommendations on consuming 
fish oil was dry eye disease and not AMD.26
In Sweden, as in the UK, the micronutrient supplements 
marketed for the prevention or treatment of AMD are over-
the-counter products and can be purchased from a variety of 
retail outlets. A recent study40 found that the majority of the 
available ocular micronutrient supplements in the US did not 
contain identical ingredients and dosages to the formula used 
in the AREDS or AREDS2 trials, and many had manufacturer 
claims that could not be supported by research evidence. 
This emphasizes the importance for eye care professionals 
to use evidence-based knowledge to educate their patients 
and recommend appropriate products. The data from Swed-
ish ophthalmologists and optometrists in the current study 
indicate that ophthalmologists tend to be somewhat restrictive 
when recommending supplements, whereas on the other hand 
optometrists seem to be overly enthusiastic for treatment and 
frequently recommend products not supported by evidence. 
Although not specifically investigated in the current survey, 
it cannot be excluded that some optometrists may have an 
economic incentive for recommending supplements.
Integrating the best current research evidence into clini-
cal decision making represents a significant challenge for eye 
care professionals. The amount of new research on AMD is 
overwhelming, and >3500 articles in ophthalmology have 
been published within the past 2 years (http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/pubmed). The dissemination of new research results is 
inadequate, and conventional educational activities focusing on 
passive knowledge acquisition have little impact on the behav-
ior of health care professionals.41 Sometimes the barriers are 
patient-related, suggesting that current guidelines do not always 
adequately incorporate patient preferences, needs, and abilities.42
As early as 1998, it was proposed that an implementation 
strategy is needed in order to change practices and to decrease 
the delay between the generation of evidence and its applica-
tion.41 The current study found that the majority of survey 
respondents relied on conference presentations and articles 
in peer-reviewed journals to support their decision making 
on the use of supplements, with relatively few accessing 
bibliographic databases or Cochrane reviews. These results 
were similar to the findings in the UK.27

In the current study, the optometrists and ophthalmolo-
gists were asked to rate the strength of evidence to support 
the use of nutritional supplements in the prevention or treat-
ment of AMD. Both the Swedish and UK optometrists27 rated 
the evidence as rather high; however, it is unclear how they 
interpreted the term “evidence”, as they reported relying on 
conference presentations and expert opinion as the basis for 
their recommendations rather than published reports. Even 
if such sources do contribute to clinical practice, they should 
not be called evidence.43
Limitations and strengths of 
the study
The total response rate in the current study (~23%) was rather 
low, especially for the ophthalmologists, but higher than 
that reported in previous studies,25–27 in which the response 
rates ranged from 5% to 16%. The majority of responders 
were optometrists (87%) and, therefore, the results reflect 
optometric practice rather than the overall management of 
AMD patients in eye care. It cannot be excluded that the oph-
thalmologists taking part in the survey had a special interest 
in AMD and nutritional supplements, which would lead to 
overestimation of the proportion of Swedish ophthalmolo-
gists recommending micronutrients. Still, the results may be 
interesting since the increase in the aging population along 
with a shortage of ophthalmologists may lead to an increased 
dependence on optometrists in the care of AMD patients in 
Sweden as in the UK.
Conclusion
Optometrists were more likely than ophthalmologists to 
recommend nutritional supplements for AMD and provided 
significantly more advice about diet, both regarding patients 
at risk and patients with established AMD. On the other hand, 
the ophthalmologists, albeit few in the current study, were 
more prone to rely on the findings of AREDS regarding AMD 
when recommending nutritional supplements and smoking 
cessation. Targeted education and implementation strategies 
may be required to establish common evidence-based strate-
gies for AMD management that can be adhered to by all eye 
care professionals involved.

Clinical Optometry is an international, peer-reviewed, open access journal 
publishing original research, basic science, clinical and epidemiological 
studies, reviews and evaluations on clinical optometry. All aspects of 
patient care are addressed within the journal as well as the practice of 
optometry including economic and business analyses. Basic and clinical 
research papers are published that cover all aspects of optics, refraction 
and its application to the theory and practice of optometry.  The manuscript 
management system is completely online and includes a very quick and fair 
 
peer-review system, which is all easy to use. Visit http://www.dovepress.
