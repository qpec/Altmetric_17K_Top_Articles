The olfactory receptor (OR) family was found to be expressed mainly in the nasal epithelium. In the last two decades members of
the OR family were detected to be functional expressed in different parts of the human body such as in liver, prostate or intestine
cancer cells. Here, we detected the expression of several ORs in the human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell line K562 and
in white blood cells of clinically diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients by RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing.
With calcium-imaging, we characterized in greater detail the cell biological role of one OR (OR2AT4) in leukemia. In both cell
systems, the OR2AT4 agonist Sandalore-evoked strong Ca2+ influx via the adenylate cyclase-cAMP-mediated pathway. The OR2AT4
antagonist Phenirat prevented the Sandalore-induced intracellular Ca2+ increase. Western blot and flow cytometric experiments
revealed that stimulation of OR2AT4 reduced the proliferation by decreasing p38-MAPK phosphorylation and induced apoptosis via
phosphorylation of p44/42-MAPK. Furthermore, Sandalore increased the number of hemoglobin-containing cells in culture. We
described for the first time an OR-mediated pathway in CML and AML that can regulate proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation
after activation. This mechanism offers novel therapeutic options for the treatment of AML.

Despite improvements in supportive care and allogeneic transplan-
tation, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is cured in o50% of patients
younger than 60 years old and o20% of patients older than 60
years old.1 The treatment’s mainstay is the 3+7 regimen (daunor-
ubicin and cytarabine), which has been in use for 430 years.1
Targeted therapies are limited to molecularly defined subtypes of the
disease. Although their scientific rationale might be convincing, the
treatment results thus far have been disappointing.2 There is an
urgent need for novel treatment approaches.
Over the last two decades, gene expression analysis has
discovered that
olfactory
receptors
(OR) expression
is not
restricted to the nasal epithelium, but is spread to different parts
of the human body.3–7 The prostate-specific G protein-coupled
receptor (PSGR), also known as OR51E2, is highly expressed in
prostate cancer cells and in the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP.8
In LNCaP and primary cancer cells β-ionon elicits a rapid Ca2+
increase by activating the PSGR and inhibits proliferation by MAPK
phosphorylation.6 Recently, a study showed that in the Huh7
hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, OR1A2 activation increased
intracellular Ca2+ and reduced cell proliferation.9 In enterochro-
maffin cells, odor stimulation released serotonin in the gut.10
K562 is a chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell line derived
from a 53-year-old CML-patient in the blast crisis.11 The bcr-abl
fusion gene produces a constitutive active tyrosine kinase and
leads to an uncontrolled proliferation of undifferentiated blood
cells. Unfortunately, tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib are
only effective against CML in newly and in-time diagnosed
patients.12 In later disease states of CML, a resistance against
bcr-abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor can occur and hinders the
treatment of CML.13 The later disease state of CML is similar to
AML which, if remains untreated, leads to death within a few
weeks. Until today, mechanism besides the bcr-abl pathways are
widely unknown, but can provide a novel therapeutic target for
the treatment against later stages of resistant CML and AML.
We detected seven ORs that were expressed (41 FPKM) in
K562, and confirmed their expression in white blood cells of newly
diagnosed AML patients. We focused on the functional character-
ization of OR2AT4, because the ligand Sandalore and the
antagonist Phenirat are already described and enable therefore
further investigations.14 We characterized the OR2AT4-mediated
signaling pathway and observed alternations in the proliferation,
apoptosis and erythrocyte differentiation caused by the regulation
of MAPK phosphorylation.
RESULTS
K562 and white blood cells of AML patients express olfactory
receptors
For
the
initial
detection
of
ectopically
expressed
ORs
in
myelogenous leukemia, we reanalyzed a free online available
NGS data set from the CML cell line K562 (SRR1207231). In total,
the expression of 7 ORs 41 FPKM could be shown (Figure 1a). In
Figure 1b we compared the expression strength of ORs in K562
cells between ORs in AML-patient blood cells. Our results showed
that most of the ORs detected 41 FPKM were higher expressed in
all tested AML-patient blood samples. Our western blot analysis
additionally verified the expression of the OR2AT4 protein in
membrane components of K562 cells (Figure 1c). We validated by
RT-PCR in K562 cDNA and in white blood cells of AML patients’
cDNA the expression of the ORs (Figure 1d). One of the highest
expressed ORs in K562 and AML patients’ cDNA was the OR2AT4.
Immunocytochemical staining of OR2AT4 showed its expression in

 K562 cells (Figure 1e). In addition, we investigated the expression
of members of the common G-protein-coupled signaling path-
ways (Supplementary Figure 1). Here, we detected the expression
of different adenylate cyclases, G-proteins, protein lipase C (PLC)
and PKA.
Sandalore increases the intracellular Ca2+ level and the cAMP
concentration in K562 cells
To investigate whether Sandalore could activate the OR2AT4 in
K562 cells, long-term (10 min) calcium-imaging experiments
with 300 μM Sandalore were performed and revealed that the
cells increased temporary their intracellular Ca2+ level within
the first 2 min during odor application (Figure 2a). The number of
Sandalore-responding cells increased during the time for which
the odorant was applied. In the first 30 s, ~ 8% of the cells
increased their intracellular Ca2+ level (Figure 2b). After a 2 min
application
of
Sandalore,
~ 40%
of
the
cells
increased
their intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Dose-response curves for
the OR2AT4 agonist Sandalore and for the weaker agonist
Brahmanol showed that 50 μM was the lowest concentration that
could slightly increase the intracellular Ca2+ level (Figure 2c).
Saturation was reached for both substances at 1 mM. The
calculated EC50 for Sandalore was 265 μM (±32), and that for
Brahmanol was 392 μM (±29; Supplementary Figure 2a). We also
observed desensitization of the Ca2+ response after repetitive
Sandalore stimulation (Figure 2d).
Next, we performed pharmacological experiments to analyze
the signaling pathway of the OR2AT4. To validate the involvement
of OR2AT4 in the Sandalore-evoked increase in intracellular Ca2+,
we used the OR2AT4 antagonist Phenirat14 (Figure 2e). By

 coapplying Phenirat and Sandalore, Ca2+ increase could be
completely blocked in a reversible manner.
Next we determined the source of Ca2+ using the Ca2+ chelator
EGTA. The absence of extracellular Ca2+ abolished the Sandalore-
evoked increase in intracellular Ca2+ (Figure 2f). To investigate the
induction of a cAMP-mediated pathway in K562 cells, we inhibited
the adenylate cyclase pathway with SQ-22536 and MDL-12,330A
(Figure 2g, Supplementary Figure 2d). Both inhibitors reversibly
abolished the Sandalore-evoked Ca2+ increase. According to this,
cAMP-Glo Assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) experiments
validated the Sandalore-evoked increase in cAMP after odor
incubation (Supplementary Figures 3a and b). In addition, the PKA
inhibitor H-89 abolished the Sandalore-evoked Ca2+ increase
(Figure 2h). We show that the irreversible PLC inhibitor U-73122
could not inhibit the Sandalore-evoked increase in intracellular
Ca2+ (Supplementary Figure 2c).
To observe whether calcium channels were activated down-
stream, we tested the T-type channel blockers NNC-55396 and
mibefradil (Supplementary Figures 2d and e). Neither inhibitors
could inhibit the Sandalore-induced Ca2+ increase. However, L-cis
diltiazem, an inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, which
additionally inhibit L-type Ca2+ channels, reduced the Sandalore
response significantly (Supplementary Figure 2f). To investigate
whether a L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channel was involved, we
used the inhibitor Verapamil (Figure 2i). Cells incubated in
Verapamil had a significantly smaller increase in intracellular
Ca2+. An overview of the calcium-imaging experiments is shown in
Figure 2j.
Owing to the observed desensitization effect that we showed
before, we investigated the significance of the blocking effect,
while comparing the Ca2+ increase evoked by Sandalore and the
inhibitors to the average first and second Sandalore application
without inhibitors (Figure 2d). The amplitudes of preincubated
inhibitors U-73122, EGTA and Verapamil were compared with the
first control application of Sandalore.
Sandalore evokes an increase in intracellular Ca2+ in white blood
cells from AML patients
To
investigate
whether
Sandalore
could
also
increase
the
intracellular Ca2+ in blood cells of sickened leukemia patients,
such as it did in K562 cells, we isolated the white blood cells of
clinically newly diagnosed AML patients and measured them
with calcium-imaging. During application of Sandalore, AML cells
significantly increased their intracellular Ca2+ (Figures 3a and b).
The Sandalore-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+ could be
blocked by co-treatment with the OR2AT4 antagonist Phenirat
(Figure 3c). Both, extracellular Ca2+ and adenylate cyclase were
necessary for the increase in intracellular Ca2+ in white blood cells
of AML patients (Figures 3d and e). However, in contrast to K562
cells, many AML cells spontaneously showed transient Ca2+
signals. To distinguish between spontaneous and odorant-
induced increases we applied Ringer’s solution to determine the
rate of responding cells during application. On average, 10% (±0.2)
of the cells responded spontaneously during the application of
Ringer’s solution (Figure 3f). Nevertheless, a significantly greater

responding cells.

 number of cells increased in intracellular Ca2+ during the
application of 100–300 μM Sandalore (27–31%).
Sandalore increases p44/42-MAPK and Akt phosphorylation and
induces time-dependent increases and decreases in p38-MAPK
phosphorylation
To observe how the increase in intracellular Ca2+ caused by
Sandalore affected the main physiological functions in K562 cells,
such as differentiation, proliferation or apoptosis, we performed
western blot experiments to investigate the phosphorylation
of different
kinases. Sandalore
increased
the
p44/42-MAPK
phosphorylation 2.1 (±0.22) times higher, and the Akt phosphor-
ylation 2.7 (±0.34) times higher compared with the untreated cells
(Figures 4a and b). p38-MAPK phosphorylation was reduced
significantly by ~ 0.74 (±0.09) after 60 min, except in the 15 min
probe, in which p38-MAPK phosphorylation was significantly
increased (1.39 ± 0.21). The phosphorylation of JNK-SAPK did not
alter. Previous studies have shown that intracellular Ca2+ could
bind to calmodulin and activate calmodulin kinase 2 (CaMKII),
which
is
able
to
trigger
the
phosphorylation
of
different
MAPKs.15,16 Therefore, cells were treated for 1 h with 100 μM
Sandalore,
including
10 μM
of
the
CaMKII
inhibitor
KN-62
(Figures 4c and d). The CaMKII inhibitor KN-62 and Sandalore-
treated cells showed decreased p44/42-MAPK and Akt phosphor-
ylation, thus confirming the initiation of phosphorylation by
Sandalore, and the activation of OR2AT4 evoked increased
intracellular Ca2+.
The activation of OR2AT4 by Sandalore inhibits cell proliferation in
K562 by decreasing the early phosphorylation of p38-MAPK
Sandalore
was
able
to
decrease
the
cell
proliferation
significantly in a dose-dependent manner (Figures 5a and b).
Sandalore (100 μM) inhibited proliferation by ~ 54%, 300 μM
Sandalore
inhibited
the
proliferation
completely.
The
IC50
for Sandalore was 74 μM (Figure 5c). To investigate the involve-
ment of MAPKs and Akt, we incubated the cells with the
appropriate inhibitors (Figure 5d). All MAPK-inhibitors decreased
the proliferation, indicating the involvement of the Sandalore-
evoked reduction in p38-MAPK phosphorylation in this process.
Phenirat was used to investigate whether the antagonist could
prevent the inhibitory effect of Sandalore (Figure 5d). Incubation
with Phenirat and Sandalore (1 : 1) could significantly increase
again the number of proliferating cells to the control level.
To study the anti-proliferative effect of Sandalore in greater
detail, we analyzed K562 cell cycle progression after 5 days of
culture. The anti-proliferative effect of Sandalore was due to a 30%
decrease of cells in the S-phase of the cell cycle. In contrast, the
proportion of cells in the G0/1- and G2/M-phases was highly
increased (Figure 5e).
The activation of OR2AT4 by Sandalore evokes cell apoptosis in
K562 by increasing p44/42-MAPK phosphorylation
To investigate whether Sandalore can induce apoptosis, we used
the Annexin-V/PI (propidium iodide) Assay (Biovision, Milpitas, CA,
USA) under microscopic conditions. The number of apoptotic cells

 increased when higher concentrations of Sandalore were used
(Figure 6a). To investigate the extent to which the phosphoryla-
tion of the MAPKs and Akt was involved in Sandalore-evoked
apoptosis, we used MAPK-inhibitors (Figure 6b, Supplementary
Figure
4).
By
blocking
p44/42-MAPK
phosphorylation,
the
apoptotic
influence
of
300 μM
Sandalore
was
completely
abolished.
Finally, we confirmed the induction of K562 apoptotic cell death
by flow cytometry using Annexin-V in combination with 7-AAD
staining. Although 100 μM Sandalore lead to a doubling of the
apoptotic cell death rate, 300 μM almost depleted all of the viable
cells (Figure 6c). The IC50 of Sandalore-induced apoptosis was
395 μM (Figure 6d).
To study whether Sandalore was capable of inducing apoptosis
of primary leukemic cells, we performed cultures with peripheral
blood blasts of AML patients. Remarkably, Sandalore induced
the apoptotic cell death of primary AML cells in culture in a
concentration-dependent manner (Figures 6e and f). Further
immunocytochemical staining revealed the activation of caspase-
3 after 1 h of treatment with 100 μM Sandalore, compared with
the control 0.1% DMSO (Figure 6g).
Sandalore enhances the hemoglobin synthesis of K562 cells by
increasing p44/42-MAPK and time-dependent p38-MAPK
phosphorylation
The altered MAPK-phosphorylation induced by 100 μM Sandalore
was able to initiate cell differentiation (Figure 7a). Here, Sandalore-
treated cells shared a greater number of differentiated cells.
To investigate whether the red cells were hemoglobin-carrying
cells, we used the Hemoglobin Assay (Figures 7b and c).
These
spectrometric
analysis
showed
that
the
amount
of
hemoglobin (HgB) concentration was significantly greater after a
6-day treatment with 100 μM Sandalore (Figure 7b). As a positive
control for the enhancement of HgB synthesis we used hemin.17

 significantly decreased Sandalore-induced hemoglobin synthesis
to the level of the control cells and verified the involvement of
OR2AT4. In contrast, 100 μM Phenirat alone did not influence the
HgB production.
To examine the involvement of MAPKs, Akt and CaMKII, we
used the same inhibitors as described before (Figure 7c). The
strong observed phosphorylation of p44/42-MAPK and the early
(minute

p38-MAPK
phosphorylation
initiated
by
100 μM
Sandalore were both necessary for the induced HgB production.
According to this, inhibition of CaMKII also prevented hemoglobin
synthesis. To quantify Sandalore-induced erythroid differentiation of
K562 cells, we stained for the terminal erythroid marker CD235a. In
Sandalore-treated cultures the majority of cells expressed high
levels of CD235a, whereas in DMSO control cultures there was

 still a high proportion of cells expressing low levels of CD235a
(Figures 7d and f). The median fluorescence intensity of CD235a
expression by Sandalore-treated cells is increased by 50% (Figure 7f).
DISCUSSION
Several studies have described the anti-cancer effects induced by
odorous substances, often terpenes, which are components of
essential oils.9,18–21 Half of all produced anti-cancer drugs are
natural products or synthetic derivatives.22,23
We used K562 cells, a common cell model for investigating the
physiology of CML, and primary cells of newly detected AML
patients owing to their high number of blastic cells. A previous
study characterized OR2AT4 in transfected HEK293 cells, the
HaCaT cutaneous cell line and primary keratinocytes determining
the specific agonists Sandalore, Javanol and Brahmanol and the
antagonists Phenirat and Oxyphenilon.14 Our experiments showed
that, in both K562 and AML cells, Sandalore activated the OR2AT4
by a cAMP-mediated pathway, via L-type calcium channels, which
contribute to the influx of extracellular Ca2+ downsteam. To
distinguish between spontaneous and the odor-induced activa-
tion we performed control experiments in which we repetitively
applied Ringer’s solution. Also in native AML cells, extracellular Ca2+
and adenylate cyclase were necessary for the Sandalore-induced
increase in intracellular Ca2+. According to this finding, other
ectopically expressed ORs, such as the OR1A2 in the Huh7
hepatocarcinoma cell line, has been described to activate a cAMP-
dependent signaling pathway.9 Calcium-imaging based dose-
response curves showed that the EC50 for the activation of OR2AT4
by Sandalore in K562 (265 μM) was in a similar concentration range
as previously demonstrated for ORs in keratinocytes (430 μM).14 In
addition, the EC50 value for the cAMP production by Sandalore in
K562 (310 μM) was similar to that observed in keratinocytes
(197 μM).14
Sandalore inhibited the proliferation of K562 cells by preventing
the p38-MAPK phosphorylation. In contrast, the activation of
OR2AT4
in
keratinocytes
was
shown
to
increase
the
cell
proliferation by up to ~ 20%.14 Comparing both cell systems,
one reason for this difference could be the different p38-MAPK
phosphorylation induced by Sandalore. In keratinocytes, p38-
MAPK was significantly increased,14 while in contrast, we observed
decreased p38-MAPK phosphorylation in K562 cells. According to
this findings, other studies of K562 cells showed that an increase
in p38-MAPK did not affect the proliferation of K562 cells, whereas
decreased p38-MAPK phosphorylation significantly reduced cell
proliferation.24 However, the involvement of MAPKs in the
regulation of physiological mechanisms vary depending on the
cell system.25,26
Flow cytometric analyses validated the inhibition of prolifera-
tion by Sandalore through significant reduction of the S-phase
and growth arrest associated with G2/M phase arrest of cell cycle
progression. In other studies, similar mechanisms were shown
during the inhibition of K562 proliferation initiated by other
substances.27
Next, we showed that Sandalore significantly increased the
number of early apoptotic cells after 1–4 h of incubation. Inhibitor
experiments revealed the involvement of Sandalore-induced
increased p44/42-MAPK phosphorylation in this process. Previous
studies have shown that for apoptosis both possibilities, namely
inhibition and enhancement by p44/42-MAPK phosphorylation,
exist, depending on either the substance or the receptor.28–32
A growing number of newly performed studies have reported that
phosphorylation
of
p44/42-MAPK
within
24 h
initiated
apoptosis.33–43 However, in the present work, we showed that
apoptosis induced by Sandalore was evoked by an increase in
intracellular Ca2+, which activated CaMKII and initiated p44/42-
MAPK phosphorylation, followed by caspase-3 activation. Wang
et al. showed a similar case evoked by a cyclic lipopeptide.44 Later,

 Wang et al. observed that this apoptotic process was due to an
increase in intracellular Ca2+ and increased p44/42-MAPK phos-
phorylation, followed by Bcl-2 downregulation, cytochrome c and
caspase-3 activation.31 Beside the investigated involvement of
CaMKII in activation of MAPK phosphorylation it could be possible
that calcium activates also other signaling kinases, such as the PKC
and which could enhance thereby the MAPK phosphorylation.
In addition, 100 μM Sandalore could increase the amount of
produced hemoglobin in K562 cell culture after 6–10 days of
incubation. According to previous studies, inhibiting early p38-
MAPK and p44/42-MAPK phosphorylation43,45–47 prevented the
Sandalore-induced differentiation of K562 cells. Hemin-induced
hemoglobin
synthesis
is,
according
to
other
studies,
not
dependent on the observed MAPK phosphorylation.46 These data
were supported by our flow cytometric analysis with CD235a, an
erythrocytic marker, which revealed a 100% increase in CD235a-
carrying cells after Sandalore incubation.
Potential role of OR2AT4 in the treatment of AML
Our data suggested that OR2AT4 is widely expressed in AML
blasts. Stimulation of OR2AT4 by Sandalore led to reduced
proliferation and enhanced apoptosis and differentiation, all of
which are desired effects of antileukemic drugs. Translating our
results into the clinic faces two major problems. First, the
concentrations required to inhibit leukemic cells in vitro were
high, on the order of 300 μM. One way of circumventing the
problem of high-Sandalore concentrations would be to develop
more powerful OR2AT4 agonists able to elicit effects at lower
concentrations. Second, as has been discussed above, the
stimulation of OR2AT4 has different effects on different tissues,
which could have detrimental effects on the organism. Further
preclinical studies are required to determine whether the OR2AT4
signaling pathway might be exploited for the treatment of
leukemia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and patient samples
K562 cells were purchased from LGC Standards GmbH (Wesel, Germany).
The cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 5% GlutaMAX (Life Technologies)
with addition of penicillin/streptomycin. The analysis of blood samples
from AML patients was approved by the ethics committee of the University
Hospital Essen and of the Knappschaftskrankenhaus Bochum (ZOKS 3841-
10). The patients provided informed consent according to institutional
guidelines. Of all, 25 patients with various types of AML participated in the
study. Details of the leukemias’ and the patients’ treatment histories are
provided in the Supplementary Table 1. Blood was drawn from central
venous lines and was incubated with Lymphoprep (Stemcell Technologies,
Cologne, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Erythro-
cytes were eliminated with lysing buffer (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg,
Germany), followed by centrifugation.
To measure cell viability, a proliferation assay was performed every 24 h
in
96-well
plates
using
the
CyQUANT
cell
proliferation
kit
(Life
Technologies), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were
seeded at a density of 2 × 104 cells/ml. All of the odorants used were
purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Sigma Aldrich, Munich, Germany). For
measurement of hemoglobin synthesis, we used the Hemoglobin Assay Kit
(Sigma Aldrich). The kit was used as described in the manufacturer’s
protocol. We incubated 5 ml of cells at 1 × 106 cells/ml in cell culture flasks
with 100 μM Sandalore for 6 days. Medium and odorant were replaced
every second day. To be able to compare the amount of hemoglobin-
containing cells, before the spectrometric analysis, control and Sandalore-
treated cells were divided into equal numbers of cells using a Neubauer
counting chamber. To distinguish between the different cell types in
culture, Sandalore-treated cells and untreated cells were stained with the
Pappenheim standard staining solution, according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (LT-SYS, Berlin, Germany).
Immunocytochemistry
Experiments were performed essentially as described previously14 with the
antibodies indicated in the figure legends. For the OR2AT4 same custom-
designed antibodies were used against the C-terminus, polyclonal (1 : 50;
Eurogentec, Seraing and Belgium) and anti-caspase-3, polyclonal (1:300;
Sigma Aldrich) as described elsewhere.14
Calcium imaging
K562 cells and white blood cells from AML patients were incubated for
20 min in concanavalin A-laminated (Sigma Aldrich) 35-mm dishes. Before
starting the calcium-imaging experiments,
RPMI-1640 medium was
replaced with Ringer’s solution. Calcium-imaging experiments were
performed as described previously.7 To investigate cell viability, 100 μM
ADP was applied to the cells at the end of the measurements. In previous
studies, ADP has been shown to increase the amount of intracellular Ca2+
in K562 cells.48
Flow cytometry
To determine the impact of Sandalore on the cell cycle status of K562 cells,
bivariate BrdU/DNA flow cytometric analysis was performed. After 5 days
of Sandalore exposure, the cells were pulsed with BrdU for 1 h. Anti-BrdU
and 7-AAD staining was completed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (BrdU Flow kit, BD Biosciences).
Annexin-V/PI staining was used to study apoptosis (Annexin-V+/PI-) and
apoptotic cell death (Annexin-V+/PI-) in K562 cells and primary AML cells
after Sandalore exposure (FITC Annexin-V Apoptosis Detection Kit I, BD
Pharmingen). Erythroid differentiation was assayed by staining the K562
cells with anti-CD235a (monoclonal mouse anti-human CD235a glycoporin
A/FITC and A/RPE, clone JC159). Flow cytometric data acquisition was
performed with a LSRII flow cytometer (BD Bioscience) and the data were
analyzed by DIVA (BD Bioscience) and FlowJo software (Treestar, Ashland,
OR, USA).
