Abstract: 
23 
 
Two independent lines of research provide evidence that speaking more than one language 
24 
may 1) contribute to increased grey matter in healthy younger and older adults and 2) delay 
25 
cognitive symptoms in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer disease (AD). We 
26 
examined cortical thickness and tissue density in monolingual and multilingual MCI and AD 
27 
patients matched (within Diagnosis Groups) on demographic and cognitive variables. In medial 
28 
temporal disease-related (DR) areas, we found higher tissue density in multilingual MCIs versus 
29 
monolingual MCIs, but similar or lower tissue density in multilingual AD versus monolingual 
30 
AD, a pattern consistent with cognitive reserve in AD. In areas related to language and cognitive 
31 
control (LCC), both multilingual MCI and AD patients had thicker cortex than the monolinguals. 
32 
Results were largely replicated in our native-born Canadian MCI participants, ruling out 
33 
immigration as a potential confound. Finally, multilingual patients showed a correlation between 
34 
cortical thickness in LCC regions and performance on episodic memory tasks. Given that 
35 
 MULTILINGUALISM AND RESERVE 
2 
multilinguals and monolinguals were matched on memory functioning, this suggests that 
36 
increased gray matter in these regions may provide support to memory functioning.  Our results 
37 
suggest that being multilingual may contribute to increased gray matter in LCC areas and may 
38 
also delay the cognitive effects of disease-related atrophy.

Introduction 
48 
 
Two independent lines of research provide evidence for bilingualism’s potential 
49 
impact on brain structure. Firstly, research with healthy younger and older adults indicates that 
50 
speaking more than one language is associated with increase gray matter volume or thickness in 
51 
language and cognitive control (LCC) areas (e.g., Klein, Mok, Chen, & Watkins, 2014). 
52 
Secondly, research with patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment 
53 
(MCI) suggests that bilingualism may contribute to cognitive reserve, similar to other enriching 
54 
lifestyle factors, as evidenced by differences in age of symptom onset (Alladi et al., 2013; 
55 
Bialystok, Craik, Binns, Ossher, & Freedman, 2014), and  medial temporal lobe atrophy 
56 
(Schweizer, Ware, Fischer, Craik, & Bialystok, 2012). Further, it has recently been proposed that 
57 
the increased gray matter seen in older bilinguals may be one of a number of variables 
58 
contributing to cognitive reserve seen in bilingual dementia patients (Gold, 2016). 
59 
 
However, the predictions made by these two independent lines of evidence have not 
60 
been concurrently evaluated in the same participants. The current study seeks to examine the 
61 
 MULTILINGUALISM AND RESERVE 
3 
above proposal by comparing cortical thickness and tissue density in LCC brain areas and areas 
62 
known to atrophy in MCI and AD (referred to here as disease-related [DR] areas), in a sample of 
63 
monolingual and multilingual MCI and AD patients, matched (within Diagnosis Group) on 
64 
cognitive functioning.  We will next briefly review the findings from each of these lines of 
65 
evidence.  Although bilingualism is commonly defined as speaking more than one language 
66 
(with most studies reporting participants who speak two languages), we use the term 
67 
multilingualism when referring to our sample, as approximately half of our multilingual patients 
68 
speak more than two languages. 
69 
 
70 
1.1 Behavioral Effects 
71 
Research over the last decade suggests that speaking more than one language may 
72 
provide cognitive benefits, specifically in executive functions involving cognitive control (for a 
73 
review see Dong & Li, 2015). Studies have shown that, compared to monolinguals, bilingual 
74 
participants are less affected by irrelevant or competing stimuli (e.g., Bialystok & Martin, 2004; 
75 
Bialystok, Craik, & Luk, 2008), are better able to switch between two tasks  (Garbin et al., 2010; 
76 
Prior & Gollan, 2011) and are better able to inhibit pre-potent responses (Costa, Hernandez, 
77 
Costa-Faidella, & Sebastián-Gallés, 2009; Luk, De Sa, & Bialystok, 2011b).  Further, this 
78 
language-group difference tends to become more pronounced in old age, such that the disparity 
79 
in performance between monolinguals and bilinguals is larger in older adults than in younger 
80 
adults (Bialystok, Craik, Klein, & Viswanathan, 2004). Although the extent of a bilingual 
81 
advantage in cognition has been the topic of much debate (e.g., Hilchey & Klein, 2011; Paap, 
82 
Johnson, & Sawi, 2015), its discussion is beyond the scope of this paper.  Instead, we aim to 
83 
 MULTILINGUALISM AND RESERVE 
4 
contribute to the literature examining whether bilingualism relates to gray matter differences, and 
84 
whether these structural brain differences may be linked to cognitive reserve. 
85 
 
86 
1.2 Morphological Effects 
87 
Studies that have demonstrated neuroplastic changes related to speaking more than one 
88 
language have largely focused on healthy younger adults and, less commonly, on older adults. 
89 
Researchers have found language group differences in grey matter in a number of brain areas 
90 
related to executive functioning, language, and the control of language (here referred to as LCC), 
91 
with increased brain matter for bilinguals compared to monolinguals. For younger adults these 
92 
regions include the left inferior frontal gyrus (Klein et al., 2014), the left Heschl’s gyrus (Ressel 
93 
et al., 2012), the left putamen (Abutalebi et al., 2013), the right and left supramarginal gyri 
94 
(Grogan et al., 2012), and the left and right cerebellum (Pliatsikas, Johnstone, & Marinis, 2014). 
95 
For older adults, these brain areas include the left anterior inferior temporal gyrus (Abutalebi et 
96 
al., 2014), the left and right inferior parietal lobe (Abutalebi, Canini, Rosa, Green, & Weekes, 
97 
2015a), and the left and right anterior cingulate cortex (Abutalebi et al., 2015b). The variability 
98 
across studies in the brain areas implicated is hypothesized to be due to differences in analysis 
99 
methods and sample selection (for comprehensive reviews see García-Pentón, Fernández García, 
100 
Costello, Duñabeitia, & Carreiras, 2015; Li, Legault, & Litcofsky, 2014). Other studies have 
101 
failed to find language group differences in older participants using whole-brain VBM analyses 
102 
(Gold, Johnson, & Powell, 2013a; Gold, Kim, Johnson, Kryscio, & Smith, 2013b) or in ROI 
103 
analyses of the DR areas like the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, or temporal pole (Olsen et al., 
104 
2015). Thus, there is accruing but variable evidence that, in healthy adults, being bilingual leads 
105 
to greater tissue density and thicker cortex when compared to monolinguals. 
106 
 MULTILINGUALISM AND RESERVE 
5 
 
107 
1.3 MCI and AD 
108 
Because multilingualism can be viewed as a factor promoting neuroplasticity (Baum & 
109 
Titone, 2014), the current investigation examines the impact of multilingualism on the brain 
110 
structure of persons with Alzheimer’s disease and those at risk for the disease (MCI). 
111 
Briefly, AD typically involves prominent episodic memory impairment, with deficits in at least 
112 
one other cognitive domain, including executive functioning, visuospatial abilities, language 
113 
functions, or personality/behaviour changes.  These deficits must be of sufficient magnitude to 
114 
lead to functional impairment.  Cerebral atrophy begins in the entorhinal cortex, with evident 
115 
cortical thinning found in the entorhinal cortex in the early phases of the illness (Román & 
116 
Pascual, 2012) and progressing throughout the medial temporal lobes in the later stages (Lerch et 
117 
al., 2005). 
118 
MCI is a clinical term used to describe an older adult in whom there is a concern (either 
119 
by the self or significant other) about mild changes in cognitive function and who performs 
120 
below expectations on age- and education-corrected objective tests.  However, the person is not 
121 
diagnosed with a dementia because these mild changes in cognition do not result in a functional 
122 
impairment.  MCI can be subdivided based on whether one single or multiple cognitive domains 
123 
have been affected, and subdivided again based on whether or not the primary impairment is in 
124 
memory. Therefore, there are four possible subtypes of MCI: (1) single domain amnestic MCI, 
125 
(2) multiple domain amnestic MCI, (3) single domain non-amnestic MCI, and (4) multiple 
126 
domain non-amnestic MCI. Research suggests that most MCI patients who go on to develop AD 
127 
show an impairment in episodic memory (i.e., single or multiple domain amnestic MCI; Albert et 
128 
al., 2011). Although significant neuronal loss is noted in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus 
129 
 MULTILINGUALISM AND RESERVE 
6 
in MCI, many MCI patients do not show significant neuropathological changes (Mufson et al., 
130 
2012; Stephan et al., 2012). Notably, in comparison to MCI patients who remain stable over 7 
131 
years, MCI patients who convert to AD show greater cortical thinning at baseline in the superior 
132 
and middle frontal gyri, superior, middle, and inferior temporal gyri, the fusiform gyrus, and 
133 
parahippocampal regions (Julkunen et al., 2009). 
134 
1.4 Cognitive Reserve 
135 
Much of the research comparing monolingual and bilingual dementia patients is rooted in 
136 
the cognitive reserve perspective. The cognitive reserve hypothesis was originally proposed to 
137 
explain non-systematic differences in the association between the degree of brain damage and 
138 
functional outcome (Stern, 2002). The theory posits that participation in cognitively stimulating 
139 
life experiences contributes to cognitive reserve (Sattler, Toro, Schönknecht, & Schröder, 2012; 
140 
Verghese et al., 2006; Wilson & Bennett, 2003; Wilson et al., 2013), which affords an individual 
141 
more flexible and/or efficient cognitive processing. This in turn allows an individual with some 
142 
kind of brain insult to function at a level higher than would be predicted based on his/her level of 
143 
neuropathology. In general, past studies exploring bilingualism and cognitive reserve tend to 
144 
compare variables such as age of symptom onset and/or age of clinical diagnosis between 
145 
monolinguals and bilinguals; structural brain measures have typically not been included. 
146 
Although the findings are mixed, there is some evidence to support a delay in the symptoms or 
147 
diagnosis of dementia for bilinguals as compared to monolinguals (for a review see, Guzmán-
148 
Vélez & Tranel, 2015). Recent research has also found a delay in symptom onset and diagnosis 
149 
for bilingual patients with MCI compared to matched monolinguals (Bialystok et al., 2014; 
150 
Ossher, Bialystok, Craik, Murphy, & Troyer, 2013). Only one study to date has matched 
151 
monolingual and bilingual AD patients on cognitive performance and then measured differences 
152 
 MULTILINGUALISM AND RESERVE 
7 
in neuropathology. Schweizer and colleagues (2012) found that bilinguals showed greater 
153 
atrophy in DR brain areas (i.e., showed less brain matter) than monolinguals when measuring the 
154 
radial width of the temporal horn and temporal horn ratio from CT scans, despite being matched 
155 
on age, education, and cognitive performance. 
156 
In summary, these two families of findings may appear contradictory insofar as research 
157 
with healthy younger and older adults suggest that bilinguals have thicker cortex/higher tissue 
158 
density compared to monolinguals, while the cognitive reserve research hypothesizes that 
159 
cognitively compromised bilinguals would have less brain matter than their monolingual peers. 
160 
The critical difference between these literatures is the brain regions of interest. In the healthy 
161 
adult literature, bilingualism is conceptualized as an enriching exercise that contributes to 
162 
neuroplasticity. As such these studies have directly measured brain areas thought to be affected 
163 
by bilingualism (i.e., LCC areas). In comparison, within the cognitive reserve literature, 
164 
bilingualism is viewed as a contributor to cognitive reserve, which is indirectly measured by 
165 
quantifying the discrepancy between disease progression (or brain atrophy) and cognitive 
166 
functioning. As such, the brain regions implicated are those medial temporal structures affected 
167 
by MCI and AD (i.e., DR areas).  
168 
We further propose that the increased gray matter previously found in LCC areas may represent, 
169 
or be related to, the neural mechanism supporting bilingualism’s contribution to cognitive 
170 
reserve. In other words, a bilingual’s ability to maintain memory functioning in the face of 
171 
disease-relevant neuropathology could be dependent on increased grey matter in brain areas 
172 
related to bilingualism. In a review of bilingualism’s contribution to cognitive reserve, Gold 
173 
(2016) makes a similar proposal, that bilinguals may experience a delay in dementia symptoms 
174 
because they are able to compensate by relying more on enhanced executive control abilities. If 
175 
 MULTILINGUALISM AND RESERVE 
8 
this were the case, one might expect a correlation between grey matter in LCC brain areas and 
176 
DR cognitive performance (i.e., episodic memory). As such, enriching lifestyle factors like 
177 
bilingualism could contribute to both functional reorganization and structural changes in the 
178 
brain. We will address this question in the current study. 
179 
1.5 Immigration 
180 
Concerning one final issue, the immigration status of research participants has a 
181 
potentially important mediating or moderating effect on bilingualism’s relationship with 
182 
cognitive functioning (Bak & Alladi, 2014; Chertkow et al., 2010; Perani & Abutalebi, 2015; 
183 
Schweizer, Craik, & Bialystok, 2013). Being bilingual is often, although not always, associated 
184 
with being an immigrant and, depending on one’s geographical location, it can be difficult to 
185 
find sizable research samples of either immigrant monolinguals or non-immigrant bilinguals. As 
186 
such, many studies have either collapsed native-born and immigrant bilinguals together or have 
187 
compared mostly immigrant bilinguals to mostly native-born monolinguals. Immigration is 
188 
related to a number of health and cognitive outcomes (e.g., Fuller-Thomson, Nuru-Jeter, 
189 
Richardson, Raza, & Minkler, 2013) and may be associated with other cognitive reserve 
190 
variables like occupation and leisure activity (Mondini et al., 2014).  Thus, this is a crucial 
191 
variable that we consider. 
192 
 
193 
1.6 Summary 
194 
 
Taken together, there is a growing body of research from healthy adults, MCI patients, and 
195 
AD patients that examines the effects of bilingualism on brain structure. The current research 
196 
aims to bridge the gaps between these group-specific findings in several important ways: 
197 
 MULTILINGUALISM AND RESERVE 
9 
1) 
Evidence exists that bilingualism results in thicker cortex in LCC brain areas. The current 
198 
study will extend this research by examining whether the differences seen in healthy younger and 
199 
older adults will be present in multilingual MCI and AD patients. 
200 
2) 
Only one study has examined neuroanatomical differences between monolingual and 
201 
bilingual AD patients (Schweizer et al., 2012) and no work has been done in MCI patients. We 
202 
aim to extend these findings by matching multilingual and monolingual MCI and AD patients on 
203 
measures of DR cognitive performance (episodic memory) and examining structural DR brain 
204 
differences among these four sub-groups. In our study, the DR brain areas examined were areas 
205 
within the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and the rhinal sulcus.  
206 
3) 
We will examine whether LCC brain regions help to support or contribute to the 
207 
hypothesized cognitive reserve in multilinguals. To examine this question, we will test whether 
208 
there is a relationship between the LCC brain areas and measures of episodic memory. 
209 
4) 
Given the potential confound of immigration on the effects of bilingualism, we will 
210 
replicate our analyses in a sub-group of non-immigrant monolingual and multilingual MCI 
211 
patients, permitting us to determine whether the effect of immigration has a significant influence 
212 
on the whole-group findings. 
213

2.0 Materials and Methods 
215 
 
216 
2.1 Participants 
217 
 
Subjects were recruited through use of a database maintained by the Memory Clinic of the 
218 
Jewish General Hospital in Montréal, Canada, a tertiary care referral clinic. Patients consented to 
219 
the use of their MRI data for research purposes, in accordance with the requirements of the 
220 
 MULTILINGUALISM AND RESERVE 
10 
Research Ethics Board of the Jewish General Hospital. The current sample was restricted to 
221 
individuals who had MRI scans conducted no earlier than the beginning November 2002, as 
222 
significant upgrades were made to the scanner earlier that year. Table 1 provides information for 
223 
demographic and neuropsychological variables for each group. 
224 
2.1.1 Diagnosis Groups 
225 
 
Patients in the current study were diagnosed with MCI or AD. MCI subjects included in 
226 
this study were clinically classified as “amnestic” or “amnestic plus” MCI, since memory was 
227 
the major complaint, memory impairment was the main objective finding, and other cognitive 
228 
domains were largely preserved on clinical evaluation. MCI diagnosis was carried out by trained 
229 
neurologists or geriatricians using standardized criteria (as reviewed in Gauthier et al., 2006; and 
230 
adapted from Petersen et al., 2001). AD was diagnosed by a neurologist or geriatrician in 
231 
consultation with other Memory Clinic physicians, nurses, and neuropsychologists, using 
232 
National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke- the Alzheimer’s 
233 
disease and Related Disorders Association criteria (McKhann, Drachman, Folstein, & Katzman, 
234 
1984). 
235 
 
We excluded patients who identified as left-handed and those where there was evidence to 
236 
believe that their cognitive function reverted to “normal” at some point following their initial 
237 
MCI diagnosis. For a number of patients, an initial scan at the time of diagnosis was conducted 
238 
prior to 2002 (and therefore on a different MRI machine); as such, the second scan was used for 
239 
24 MCI and 5 AD patients, and the third scan for 2 MCI patients. The finalized database 
240 
analyzed here consists of 94 patients, 68 with MCI and 26 with AD.

2.1.2 Language groups 
249 
 
Our sample had 34 monolingual MCI patients, 34 multilingual MCI patients, 13 
250 
monolingual AD patients, and 13 multilingual AD patients. Multilingualism was defined 
251 
according to the criterion set out by Bialystok and colleagues (Bialystok, Craik, & Freedman, 
252 
                                                 
1 Age of symptom onset information was assessed via family interviews in which an estimate of the year and month of onset of memory 
complaints was determined by the question, ‘‘Can you give the month and year when you first noticed memory problems (in the patient)?’’ 
 MULTILINGUALISM AND RESERVE 
12 
2007) for bilingualism, namely that the majority of the participant’s life was spent regularly 
253 
using at least two languages, and was based upon chart information derived from a 
254 
neuropsychological interview. Details regarding age of acquisition and proficiency was not 
255 
reliably available in all patients. Monolingual participants spoke only one language, and 
256 
multilingual participants were defined as speaking two or more languages. Monolingual patients 
257 
were either English or French speakers. Within the multilingual group, just over half were 
258 
bilingual, with the majority being English/French or French/English bilinguals. Similarly, for 
259 
those who spoke three or more languages, all but one spoke English, French, and one of a variety 
260 
of other languages (e.g., Yiddish, Hebrew, Greek, Arabic, etc.). 
261 
 
Immigration was determined by the place of birth for each participant; however, age at of 
262 
immigration to Canada was unknown. Numbers in the non-immigrant AD group were too small 
263 
to achieve statistical power; therefore, data from only non-immigrant MCI patients were 
264 
analysed (27 monolinguals and 14 multilinguals). 
265 
2.1.3 Matching variables 
266 
We matched each language group (monolingual or multilingual) within each Diagnosis 
267 
Group (MCI or AD) on a number of measures of clinical severity and cognitive functioning: 
268 
years of education, age at time of scan, time from neuropsychological assessment to scan, Mini 
269 
Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score, and two tests of episodic memory (all p >.15). 
270 
Episodic memory tests included:  percentage of words recalled (short delay and long delay verbal 
271 
recall score) from either the California Verbal Learning Test - Second edition (CVLT-II; Delis, 
272 
Kramer, Kaplan, & Ober, 2000) or the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT; Spreen & 
273 
Strauss, 1998), and raw immediate and delayed recall score from the Wechsler Memory Scale - 
274 
III Visual Reproduction subtest (WMS III; Wechsler, 1997b).  Note that over the course of time, 
275 
 MULTILINGUALISM AND RESERVE 
13 
the clinical assessment protocol changed such that some participants were assessed with the 
276 
RAVLT (maximum possible total score = 15) and later participants were tested with the CVLT-
277 
II (maximum possible total score = 16).  Thus, in order to combine data across participants, 
278 
verbal recall performance is expressed as a percentage of the total possible score. 
279 
 
280 
2.2 Cognitive functioning 
281 
Additional data from the neuropsychological assessments were analyzed to examine 
282 
whether the language groups differ from each other in other cognitive domains. Scores were 
283 
derived from standardized neuropsychological tests administered during a clinical assessment 
284 
session. The six measures included: The Victoria Stroop Task (Spreen & Strauss, 1998), the 
285 
Spatial Span subtest from the WMS III; Block Design from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence 
286 
Scale third edition (WAIS III; Wechsler, 1997a); Trails A (Reitan, 1958), orientation, and clock 
287 
design (Rouleau, Salmon, Butters, & Kennedy, 1992). 
288 
 
289 
2.3 MRI Acquisition and Pre-Processing 
290 
High-resolution (1-mm isotropic) T1-weighted sagittal images were acquired on a 
291 
Siemens SonataVision 1.5 T scanner (TR=22, TE=9.2) at the Montreal Neurological Institute 
292 
(MNI), Brain Imaging Center. Structural images were submitted to the Civet pipeline (version 
293 
1.1.11; http://wiki.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/index.php/Civet) developed at the MNI for fully automated 
294 
structural image analysis (Ad-Dab'bagh et al., 2006), whose steps are detailed elsewhere 
295 
(Karama et al., 2009). All pipeline products (surfaces and volumes) were manually validated by 
296 
the second author (J.N.), prior to morphometrical analysis consisting of both cortical thickness 
297 
analysis (CTA) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Thickness values, generated by the 
298 
 MULTILINGUALISM AND RESERVE 
14 
pipeline, while measured in native space (mm), had their coordinates transformed into a 
299 
standardized space (MNI ICBM), thus providing a common space for group-level analyses, and 
300 
comparison with the literature. Prior to the analyses, thickness values were subjected to a 20-mm 
301 
surface blur in order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio.  For the VBM analyses, grey matter 
302 
volumes derived from the Civet tissue classification stage were convolved with an 8-mm full-
303 
width at half-maximum (FWHM) 3D Gaussian blurring kernel, prior to being entered into the 
304 
regression analyses. The focus of the VBM analysis was primarily on gray matter changes within 
305 
medial structures, such as the hippocampus, since examination of cortical-level changes, while 
306 
also seen within the VBM results, are best performed with the more sensitive CTA. As such, the 
307 
VBM analysis should be seen as both extending and complementing the CTA. 
308 
 
309 
2.4 Definition and Sampling of a priori Brain Regions 
310 
Two families of hypothesis-driven, and anatomically-constrained, regions of interest 
311 
(ROIs) were selected based on: 1) areas implicated in language and cognitive control (LCC 
312 
regions) and 2) areas known to atrophy in MCI and AD (DR regions). Within each ROI, the 
313 
specific vertex or voxel analysed was chosen based on either the specific coordinates given in 
314 
relevant publications or, when not available, the general functional or anatomical brain region 
315 
reported in the literature (e.g., BA45, or left inferior frontal gyrus), and was then refined by the 
316 
results of our exploratory regression analyses. This process allowed us to account for individual 
317 
variability in the location of functional substrates, subtle differences in coordinate systems, and 
318 
differences that could have been introduced by image pre-processing and template registration. 
319 
As such, we were able to analyze the vertex or voxel with the strongest effect in our data, while 
320 
remaining within a given ROI as guided by our a priori hypotheses and the literature. For 
321 
 MULTILINGUALISM AND RESERVE 
15 
example, Abutalebi et al. (2014) found decreased grey matter volume (using VBM) in the left 
322 
anterior temporal lobe at xyz= [-45, -4, -36] (MNI-space) in healthy older adults, whereas we 
323 
sampled the left anterior temporal lobe at xyz=[-51, -10, -40], as this location, while still in close 
324 
spatial proximity to that of Abutalebi et al., showed the largest effect in our exploratory 
325 
regression analysis in our patient samples. ROIs that did not contain significant vertices/voxels in 
326 
the global regression analysis were not further analysed. As our choice of ROIs for the LCC 
327 
regions was motivated by a relatively small pool of empirical findings in younger and or 
328 
bilingual participants, we provide our sampling coordinates in Table 2 to facilitate comparison 
329 
with that literature.

2.5 Statistical Analyses 
338 
 
339 
Demographic and neuropsychological variables were assessed with ANOVAs and 
340 
planned comparisons were conducted to examine the effects of language group within each 
341 
Diagnosis Group.  With regard to the imaging data, statistical analyses were carried out in a 
342 
similar manner for both the cortical thickness and VBM data, with the dependent variable (DV) 
343 
being native-space, vertex-level cortical thickness (measured in millimeters, CTA), or voxel-
344 
level, grey matter tissue density (VBM). For the exploratory analyses, two regression equations 
345 
were run over all vertices and voxels: one to examine the effects of Language and Diagnosis 
346 
Group, and another to test for a significant interaction between these two variables. In both cases, 
347 
age (at time of scan), Language Group (monolingual or multilingual), and Diagnosis Group 
348 
(MCI or AD) were covariates in the regression analyses. These statistical analyses were 
349 
 MULTILINGUALISM AND RESERVE 
17 
performed using specialized software packages (Lerch et al., 2010; 2014), running under the R 
350 
statistical analysis software (www.R-project.org). Results of these exploratory regressions were 
351 
used to identify a set of xyz coordinates, closely matching the a priori defined ROIs motivated 
352 
by the literature. These coordinates were subsequently used to sample thickness and tissue 
353 
density values for use in further analyses. 
354 
Identification of additional regions (i.e., those not included in the list of a priori ROIs), 
355 
was subsequently carried out by inspection of significant focal effects identified in the 
356 
exploratory regressions, following application of a false-discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 
357 
q=0.05, thus correcting for multiple comparisons across all vertices/voxels over which the 
358 
regressions were run.  Significant effects of spatial extent were also investigated via a cluster 
359 
analysis (see section 3.2), using a cluster defining threshold of p=0.001, as suggested by Eklund 
360 
et al. (2016). 
361 
3.0 Results 
362 
3.1 Cognitive Functioning 
363 
See Table 1 for means and standard errors of neuropsychological variables, and F- and p-
364 
values from planned comparisons of language groups within each Diagnosis Group. There was a 
365 
main effect of Diagnosis Group (all p < .001) for all neuropsychological variables, with MCI 
366 
patients outperforming AD patients. No main effect of Language Group was found for any other 
367 
neuropsychological variables, (all p > .207). 
368 
 
369 
3.2 Imaging – Exploratory Analyses 
370 
Application of the additive regression equation over all vertices yielded significant 
371 
findings for both the Age and Diagnosis effects. The effect of Age (not shown, as they are not 
372 
 MULTILINGUALISM AND RESERVE 
18 
central to this investigation) was broadly, and bilaterally distributed over association cortex, 
373 
including regions within anterior temporal, parietal, and prefrontal areas, medial SFG and 
374 
entorhinal cortex, reflected the expected pattern of increased thinning associated with age. This 
375 
spatial pattern was similarly reflected in the cluster analysis results. The effect of Diagnosis, as 
376 
seen in both the vertex-level regressions and the cluster analysis (see top row, Figure 1) was 
377 
primarily limited to the right precuneus, and posterior MTG, and the left parahippocampal gyrus. 
378 
Neither the additive model’s Language effect, nor the interactive model’s Language by 
379 
Diagnosis interaction was found to yield any significant vertices, following FDR correction for 
380 
multiple comparisons. Figure 1 (middle row) and Figure 2 shows the uncorrected t-values for the 
381 
Language main effect, whereas Figure 1 (bottom row) shows the uncorrected t-values for the 
382 
interaction effects. These results are used for sampling point selection. 
383 
3.3 Imaging – Group Comparison Analyses OR ANOVAs 
384 
These results, highlighting structural differences between Language and Diagnostic 
385 
groups, were computed on values extracted from sampling-points from within a priori-defined  
386 
LCC and DR regions, and refined by the exploratory analyses.  See Table 3 (3a and 3b) for t- and 
387 
p-values from the regression analyses, separated by ROI family2. In order to control for Type I 
388 
error, a family-wise error rate was set for each of the two families of regions, dividing the 
389 
nominal alpha value (.05) by the number of brain regions tested.  Thus, for the LCC family of 
390 
analyses involving 12 cortical regions, alpha was .05/12=.004, and for the DR family of analyses 
391 
involving alpha was .05/6=.008. Below, we present the results separated by ROI family (LCC, 
392 
DR), first reporting any main effects of Language Group, followed by Language Group by 
393 
                                                 
2 Additionally, see Table B.1 (in Supplementary Materials) for the precise sampling coordinates 
in MNI-152 coordinates space, as well as the mean cortical thickness (and standard error) and 
tissue density for monolingual and multilingual MCI and AD patients.

3.3.1.1 Language group effects. As can be seen in Figures 3a and 3b and in Table 3a, there was a 
398 
main effect of language group in all of the LCC brain areas (all p <.026, uncorrected for multiple 
399 
comparisons), indicating greater cortical thickness for multilinguals compared to monolinguals. 
400 
After controlling for Family-wise Type I error, this language group difference remain significant 
401 
for the right inferior frontal gyrus, right ventromedial prefrontal cortex, right cerebellum, and 
402 
right cerebellar tonsil. None of the regions showed a reliable effect of Diagnosis Group (all 
403 
p’s>.066). The putamen and Heschl’s gyrus did not exceed a threshold of t > 2.00 in the 
404 
exploratory regression analyses, and therefore were not further processed.

408 
this finding, does not remain significant at p=0.05 after controlling for multiple comparisons.

3.3.2 Disease-Related Regions

3.3.2.1 Language group effects. As seen in Figure 4a, greater gray matter tissue density 
413 
was found within the multilingual group compared to the monolingual group (collapsed across 
414 
Diagnosis Groups) in both left and right hippocampi (all ps <.009). Both regions remain 
415 
significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. These regions also showed a significant 
416 
effect of Diagnosis Group, with higher tissue density for MCI than AD patients (all ps from < 
417 
0.01). 
418 
3.3.2.2. Interaction effects. As seen in Figure 4b, the left and right parahippocampal gyri 
419 
and the left and right rhinal sulci show a similar pattern, with the overall trend towards increased 
420 
tissue density in the multilingual MCIs compared to the monolinguals and the reverse pattern 
421 
 MULTILINGUALISM AND RESERVE 
21 
(i.e., lower tissue density in the multilinguals compared to monolinguals) in the AD patients. 
422 
This was supported by a reliable Language Group by Diagnosis Group interaction for voxels 
423 
within the left and right parahippocampal gyri (p  = .008 and p = .002 respectively; maintained 
424 
following Type I correction), and left and right rhinal sulci (p = .016 and p = .041;which did not 
425 
survive correction for Family-wise Type I error). Planned comparisons indicated that 
426 
multilingual MCI patients had higher tissue density than monolingual MCI patients in voxels 
427 
within the right parahippocampal gyrus, while the opposite pattern was found in the AD patients 
428 
(i.e., lower tissue density for multilinguals compared to monolinguals) in the left and right 
429 
parahippocampal gyri. 
430 
3.3.2.3 MCI conversion. Recall that within a group of MCI patients, some will likely 
431 
progress to AD, whereas others will not. To explore whether these potential subgroups differed 
432 
in the pattern of findings, we divided our monolingual and multilingual MCI groups by whether 
433 
or not the patient has since been diagnosed with AD. The average follow-up period was 8.5 years, 
434 
with 12 of the non-converted MCI patients having been followed for less than 5 years. A 
435 
Language Group by Conversion Group ANOVA indicated that amongst the MCI patients who as 
436 
yet had not converted to AD, multilingual MCIs showed a pattern of thicker cortex and higher 
437 
tissue density in vertices/voxels within the LCC and DR areas compared to monolingual MCIs.  
438 
In contrast, there were no Language Group difference among those MCIs who later converted to 
439 
AD3. See Table 4 for group means, standard errors, F-values, and p-values for monolingual and 
440 
multilingual MCI converters and non-converters. 
441 
                                                 
3 Note that period over which participants were followed did not differ reliably between non-
converter monolinguals and multilinguals.  However, we caution that these post-hoc analyses 
should be replicated.

3.3.3 Correlational results 
447 
Bivariate correlations were used to examine the relationship between memory variables 
448 
and cortical thickness of vertices within LCC areas.  By necessity, these correlations were 
449 
conducted within each group separately, as we expected the pattern of results to differ.  Table 5 
450 
shows the resulting Pearson’s r and p values. For the monolingual MCI patients, there were no 
451 
correlations between episodic memory recall scores (short delay verbal, long delay verbal, 
452 
immediate visual, delayed visual) and LCC cortical thickness.  In contrast, a number of 
453 
significant correlations were found for the multilingual MCI patients between the long delay 
454 
verbal recall score and brain regions, including the left inferior frontal gyrus, left pre-
455 
supplementary motor area, left anterior temporal gyrus, and left supramarginal gyrus, and 
456 
between the delayed visual recall score and the left anterior temporal gyrus and right cerebellum. 
457 
For the AD patients, we only examined the short delay verbal and immediate visual recall scores, 
458 
as many patients scored at floor on the long delay measures. For the monolingual AD patients, 
459 
there was only one significant correlation (immediate visual recall score and the left inferior 
460 
parietal lobule). In contrast, there were several reliable correlations in the multilingual AD 
461 
patients, namely between the short delay verbal recall score and the left inferior frontal gyrus, 
462 
right inferior frontal gyrus, and left supramarginal gyrus.  Figure 5 shows illustrates the 
463 
scatterplots for the reliable correlations between verbal memory performance and the left inferior 
464 
frontal gyrus for the multilingual MCI and AD participants (upper right and lower right panels, 
465 
respectively) compared to the non-reliable correlations for the monolingual MCI and AD 
466 
participants (upper left and lower left panels, respectively).

3.3.4 Immigration group analyses 
473 
To examine the potential influence of immigration on the current data, we repeated our 
474 
regression analyses on a sub-sample of non-immigrant patients.  Importantly, the two language 
475 
groups did not differ on demographic variables, MMSE, age, years of education (all p > .09) nor 
476 
in the same set of neuropsychological variables as the larger sample (p > .155). Vertices and 
477 
voxels of interest were based on those used in the entire sample, but adjusted to the location of 
478 
the largest t-statistic within the general functional region within these subgroups. Table 6 shows 
479 
the demographic information, coordinates, mean cortical thickness/grey matter density, and t and 
480 
p values. With regards to DR brain areas, multilinguals had higher tissue density values in voxels 
481 
within the left and right entorhinal and perirhinal cortices; however, these were subtle and did 
482 
not survive correction for multiple comparisons. No differences were found in the voxels of 
483 
interest within the left or right hippocampi. With regards to LCC areas, these results largely 
484 
confirmed those found with the whole sample, showing thicker cortex in the multilingual group 
485 
than in the monolingual group, which includes vertices within the left and right inferior frontal 
486 
gyri, left and right anterior temporal gyri, left inferior parietal lobule, and the right cerebellar 
487 
tonsil. Results were more reliable in the right hemisphere than the left. Only the right anterior 
488 
temporal gyrus, left inferior parietal lobule, and the right cerebellar tonsil survived correction for 
489 
multiple comparisons. No differences were seen in the anterior cingulate cortex, putamen, or the

4.0 Discussion 
496 
The aim of the present study was to investigate whether a history of speaking more than 
497 
one language contributes to structural brain differences in MCI and AD patients. Specifically, 
498 
cortical thickness and grey matter density were measured in monolingual and multilingual 
499 
groups of MCI and AD patients, who were (within each Diagnosis Group) matched on episodic 
500 
 MULTILINGUALISM AND RESERVE 
27 
memory functioning, MMSE, age (at time of scan), and education. We found 1) multilingual 
501 
MCI and AD patients showed increased brain matter in the form of thicker cortex and higher 
502 
grey matter density compared to matched monolinguals in LCC brain areas, 2) evidence for the 
503 
contribution of bilingualism to cognitive reserve in AD patients, but not MCI patients, 3) both 
504 
AD and MCI multilinguals show positive correlations between episodic memory scores and 
505 
certain brain regions outside of the medial temporal region, suggesting that multilinguals may 
506 
have access to a compensatory network that offsets medial temporal lobe changes and helps 
507 
maintain some degree of memory functioning, and finally, 4) we largely replicated the LCC area 
508 
results within a group of non-immigrant MCI patients, indicating that the results were not likely 
509 
due to any potential influence of immigration. We will examine each of these results below. 
510 
4.1 LCC Brain Areas 
511 
One of the major findings of this study was the evidence for contribution of bilingualism 
512 
to structural brain changes in LCC brain areas in persons with or at risk for AD. We found 
513 
greater grey matter in multilinguals (both MCI and AD) as compared to monolinguals in left and 
514 
right inferior frontal gyri, left medial superior frontal gyrus, right ventromedial prefrontal cortex, 
515 
left and right anterior temporal gyri, left parietal lobule, left and right cerebellum, and right 
516 
cerebellar tonsil. 
517 
Previous research has found neuroanatomical differences between monolingual and 
518 
bilingual adults without neurological disease and has posited that the differences in brain 
519 
structure seen between the language groups represent neuroplastic changes brought about by the 
520 
experience of speaking more than one language (for reviews see, García-Pentón et al., 2015; Li 
521 
et al., 2014). The adaptive control hypothesis (Green & Abutalebi, 2013) posits that language 
522 
comprehension and production require the interaction of multiple discrete and overlapping 
523 
 MULTILINGUALISM AND RESERVE 
28 
control processes (e.g., goal maintenance, conflict monitoring) carried out by interconnected 
524 
networks of brain regions and furthermore, that bilingual language functioning results in 
525 
adaptive changes in the recruitment of, and interactions between, these networks. Functional 
526 
neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that the regions recruited by bilinguals in the 
527 
hypothesized series of networks are indeed involved in language processing and/or cognitive 
528 
control (for a review see, Li et al., 2014). Our data contribute to the hypothesis that having two 
529 
languages “exercises” specific brain regions implicated in various control processes, inducing 
530 
neural changes that can be seen at the level of increased cortical thickness and grey matter 
531 
density, and extends these findings by demonstrating that these structural differences can be seen 
532 
in the brains of multilingual MCI and AD patients. 
533 
4.2 Cognitive reserve 
534 
4.2.1 Cognitive reserve in AD patients 
535 
We found that multilingual AD patients showed thinner cortex and lower tissue density in 
536 
the posterior parahippocampal gyri and the rhinal sulci compared to their monolingual 
537 
counterparts, suggesting more AD neuropathology in the memory-specific substrates. This 
538 
suggests that their increased cognitive reserve (gained from a history of managing two languages) 
539 
allowed them to perform at the level of their monolingual peers on several episodic memory 
540 
tasks, despite having sustained more atrophy in areas related to memory processing.  Note that 
541 
cognitive reserve can be demonstrated through a number of different outcomes. One way is to 
542 
compare the records of all eligible participants as a function of whether the cognitive reserve 
543 
promoter is present or absent and determine whether the target group has delayed symptom onset 
544 
or older age at diagnosis (e.g., Bialystok et al., 2007; Alladi et al., 2013).  A second way, which 
545 
is the one used in our study, is to hold those factors constant, and then observe whether there is 
546 
 MULTILINGUALISM AND RESERVE 
29 
evidence of brain differences which might allow the group with the higher hypothesized reserve 
547 
to compensate for brain disease.  This is the pattern that we observed, through the combined 
548 
findings of a) reduced brain matter in posterior parahippocampal gyri and the rhinal sulci in 
549 
multilingual AD patients compared to the monolinguals, and b) positive associations between 
550 
LCC brain regions and episodic memory performance only in the multilingual patient groups. 
551 
This is the second study to use neuroanatomical measures to examine the impact of 
552 
speaking more than one language in AD patients who are balanced on clinical severity/cognitive 
553 
performance. Schweizer and colleagues (2012) found that bilingual AD patients showed greater 
554 
medial temporal atrophy (as measured by several estimates of brain volume derived from CT 
555 
scans) compared to a group of monolingual AD patients matched on age, education, and 
556 
cognitive functioning.  Importantly, our results, derived through the use of high-resolution 
557 
whole-brain MRI scans and sophisticated pre-processing and analysis techniques, extend these 
558 
findings by enabling the precise measurement of cortical thickness and tissue density within 
559 
specific medial temporal lobe structures. Our results indicate that, in the early stages of AD, 
560 
multilinguals were able to tolerate more atrophy in the posterior parahippocampal gyri and rhinal 
561 
sulci than monolinguals, while maintaining a comparable cognitive level. Moreover, we were 
562 
able to demonstrate that multilingual patients with MCI did not show similar decreases in medial 
563 
temporal cortex relative to their monolingual peers; in fact, they showed the opposite pattern. 
564 
Interestingly, the results seen in the hippocampi proper are not in line with predictions 
565 
made by the cognitive reserve hypothesis. Specifically, we would have expected to see decreased 
566 
grey matter density in the left and right hippocampi in multilingual AD patients compared to 
567 
monolingual AD patients, as we saw for the parahippocampal gyri. Instead, the hippocampi 
568 
showed a main effect of Language Group suggesting greater hippocampal volumes for the 
569 
 MULTILINGUALISM AND RESERVE 
30 
multilinguals compared to the monolinguals, regardless of Diagnosis Group. The lack of a 
570 
reserve-congruent pattern in the left and right hippocampi, although puzzling, may simply be due 
571 
to the fact that our AD sample consists of mostly early-AD patients. Recent research shows that 
572 
neurodegeneration often occurs in the parahippocampal gyrus before the hippocampus (Desikan 
573 
et al., 2009; e.g., Echávarri et al., 2010). As such, the AD patients in this sample may not have 
574 
experienced significant enough neurodegeneration in the hippocampus proper for the 
575 
multilinguals to demonstrate the expected cognitive reserve pattern. The AD patients in our study 
576 
did, however, show reliably smaller hippocampi compared to the MCI participants, which is a 
577 
predictable pattern of results and indicates that our Diagnosis Groups conform to this often-
578 
replicated pattern. 
579 
4.2.2 Cognitive Reserve in MCI patients 
580 
The current study is the first to use neuroanatomical measures to examine the impact of 
581 
multilingualism in MCI patients who are balanced on disease-specific cognitive functioning. We 
582 
hypothesized that the multilingual MCI patients would not differ from monolingual MCI patients 
583 
in DR areas as they have not begun to experience substantial AD atrophy. Unlike our 
584 
multilingual AD patients, who showed evidence of cognitive reserve (thinner cortex and 
585 
decreased grey matter density compared to monolingual AD patients in DR areas), the 
586 
multilingual MCI patients did not. They showed either thicker cortex/higher grey matter density 
587 
or did not differ reliably from the monolingual MCIs. Our sample was composed of MCI patients 
588 
whose primary deficits were in the memory domain, and these are the individuals who are more 
589 
likely to convert to AD (Albert et al., 2011). Although the sample sizes were small, our results 
590 
indicated that among the MCI patients who had as of yet not converted to AD, multilingual 
591 
MCIs showed a pattern of thicker cortex and higher tissue density in vertices and voxels within 
592 
 MULTILINGUALISM AND RESERVE 
31 
both LCC and DR areas compared to monolingual MCIs, whereas there were no Language 
593 
Group differences between monolingual and multilingual MCI patients that had converted to AD. 
594 
Based on this pattern, it is possible that there is heterogeneity in the extent to which increased 
595 
gray matter is expressed in multilinguals, with those who show evidence of it perhaps being 
596 
delayed in their development of AD, or may not develop the disease at all. Those MCI patients 
597 
who show lesser amounts of increased gray matter appear more likely to decline to dementia in 
598 
the future. 
599 
4.3 Correlational Results 
600 
In order to explore how patients could demonstrate equivalent performance on memory 
601 
tests, despite evidence of reduced medial temporal matter, we examined the potential relationship 
602 
between brain areas related to bilingualism and performance on memory tests. Interestingly, we 
603 
found that multilingual patients showed significant correlations between episodic memory 
604 
measures and a number of brain regions typically associated with language processing and 
605 
cognitive control, while monolingual patients did not. It has been previously suggested that 
606 
increased white matter density in older bilinguals compared to monolinguals may form the 
607 
neural basis for bilingualism’s contribution to cognitive reserve (Luk, Bialystok, Craik, & Grady, 
608 
2011a). Similarly, we suggest that the cognitive reserve experienced by our multilingual AD 
609 
patients may be made possible by the thicker cortex in frontal and parietal cognitive control areas. 
610 
In other words, we take the correlation between cognitive control regions and episodic memory 
611 
performance as evidence towards the hypothesis that multilingual patients are able to utilize 
612 
alternate networks (i.e., the neural compensation subtype of cognitive reserve) for memory 
613 
processing and that they are able to do so because of their increased grey matter in brain regions 
614 
exercised by being bilingual. However, these results are based on post-hoc correlational analyses 
615 
 MULTILINGUALISM AND RESERVE 
32 
and should be interpreted with caution.  A stronger test of this hypothesis would be to examine 
616 
white matter tracts and functional connectivity between these regions, which is a current area of 
617 
research for us. 
618 
4.4 Non-immigrant MCI sub-sample 
619 
Another unique strength of the current study is that we found similar results with a 
620 
subgroup of non-immigrant MCI patients. Given the potential confounding effect of immigration 
621 
with bilingualism, we replicated our analyses with a monolingual and multilingual non-
622 
immigrant subgroup of MCI patients. Disease-relevant ROI results show that monolingual and 
623 
multilingual MCI patients do not differ significantly in these regions. The pattern of results from 
624 
the LCC ROIs largely mirror those seen with the overall sample: multilingual patients show 
625 
reliably thicker cortex in frontal, temporal, parietal, and cerebellar regions. Results for the medial 
626 
frontal lobe (pre-supplementary motor/ventromedial prefrontal areas) and the supramarginal gyri 
627 
were in the same direction but were found to be non-reliable differences, likely due to the lower 
628 
statistical power in this subgroup analysis. Unfortunately, we were not able to conduct similar 
629 
analyses for the AD participants due to the smaller sample sizes. Nevertheless, if we were to 
630 
extrapolate from our findings with the MCI participants, our results generally suggest that the 
631 
important potential confound of immigration may not be playing a role in our results. 
632 
4.5 Limitations 
633 
This study has its limitations. Firstly, as data in this study were gathered retrospectively, 
634 
the information that we had on language history and use was limited. As noted in recent reviews 
635 
(e.g., Calvo, García, Manoiloff, & Ibáñez, 2016; Duncan & Phillips, 2016), important variables 
636 
related to bilingualism (e.g., age of acquisition, degree of proficiency, contextual uses of 
637 
language) may have an influence in the contribution to cognitive reserve expression. Secondly, 
638 
 MULTILINGUALISM AND RESERVE 
33 
this study was limited by a lack of data from healthy older adults that could have provided 
639 
appropriate baselines to compare the level of neurodegeneration in the Diagnosis Groups. 
640 
Relatedly, larger sample sizes would allow us the ability to split our multilingual group into 
641 
bilinguals and multilinguals to determine whether there is any linear or dose-response to 
642 
speaking multiple languages. This is important given that previous research suggests that the two 
643 
groups may differ in terms of the cognitive impact of AD neuropathology (Chertkow et al., 
644 
2010). It is important to note that, although our sample sizes, especially for the MCI group, are at 
645 
or in excess of those reported in the younger and older healthy adult literature (for a review see 
646 
Garcia-Penton et al., 2015), these results should still be considered preliminary and require 
647 
confirmation with more stringent voxelwise approaches and larger sample sizes. 
648 
4.6 Summary 
649 
Our data contribute to the growing literature that there may be subtle differences in brain 
650 
structure related to multilingualism. These results add new information to the individual and 
651 
intersecting bodies of literature on the hypothesized protective effect of bilingualism against the 
652 
cognitive effects of dementia (CR) and neuroplasticity associated with bilingualism (where past 
653 
studies have typically been limited to healthy young and old adults). Ours is the first study to use 
654 
structural MRI data to examine cognitive reserve in MCI patients and in AD patients, the first to 
655 
assess structure in LCC regions in MCI and AD patients, the first to demonstrate an association 
656 
between LCC regions and memory function in these groups, and the first to control for 
657 
immigration status in these groups. Overall, our results contribute to the research findings that 
658 
indicate that speaking more than one language is one of a number of lifestyle factors that 
659 
contributes to reserve and supports the notion that multilingualism and its associated cognitive 
660 
and sociocultural benefits are associated with brain plasticity.

Highlights: 
955 
- 
Multilingual MCI and AD patients show thicker cortex than monolinguals in cognitive 
956 
control areas.  
957 
- 
Multilingual AD patients show cognitive reserve in medial temporal areas. 
958 
Memory is positively correlated with cortical thickness in multilingual patients only.
