ABSTRACT Avian keratin disorder (AKD), characterized by debilitating overgrowth of the avian beak, was first documented in
black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) in Alaska. Subsequently, similar deformities have appeared in numerous species
across continents. Despite the widespread distribution of this emerging pathology, the cause of AKD remains elusive. As a result,
it is unknown whether suspected cases of AKD in the afflicted species are causally linked, and the impacts of this pathology at the
population and community levels are difficult to evaluate. We applied unbiased, metagenomic next-generation sequencing to
search for candidate pathogens in birds affected with AKD. We identified and sequenced the complete coding region of a novel
picornavirus, which we are calling poecivirus. Subsequent screening of 19 AKD-affected black-capped chickadees and 9 control
individuals for the presence of poecivirus revealed that 19/19 (100%) AKD-affected individuals were positive, while only 2/9
(22%) control individuals were infected with poecivirus. Two northwestern crows (Corvus caurinus) and two red-breasted nut-
hatches (Sitta canadensis) with AKD-consistent pathology also tested positive for poecivirus. We suggest that poecivirus is a
candidate etiological agent of AKD.
IMPORTANCE Avian keratin disorder (AKD) is an increasingly common disease of wild birds. This disease, characterized by beak
overgrowth, was first described in the late 1990s and has been spreading rapidly both geographically and in terms of host species
affected. AKD decreases host fitness and can be fatal. However, the cause of the disease has remained elusive, and its impact on
host populations is poorly understood. We found a novel and divergent picornavirus in 19/19 AKD-affected black-capped chick-
adees that we examined but in only 2/9 control cases. We also found this virus in 4 individuals of 2 other passerine species that
exhibited symptoms consistent with AKD. Our data suggest that this novel picornavirus warrants further investigation as the
causative agent of AKD.

A
n epizootic of gross beak abnormalities was first documented
among black-capped chickadees (BCCH [Poecile atricapil-
lus]) in Alaska in the late 1990s (Fig. 1) (1). Birds suffering from
this condition, termed avian keratin disorder (AKD), exhibit a
variety of beak deformities (including elongation, crossing, and
pronounced curvature) that interfere with the ability to feed and
preen, behaviors vital for survival (1). In addition, affected birds
exhibit changes in diet (2), changes in plumage structure and color
(3), and higher rates of opportunistic infections (4) and avian
malaria (5). As a result, affected individuals suffer fitness conse-
quences, including decreased survival (1, 6). While data on the
specific sources of morbidity and mortality are lacking, inability to
feed and preen are presumed to lead to decreased fitness and mor-
tality as a result of starvation, exposure to the elements, and infec-
tion with a variety of parasites and pathogens.
The population-level impacts of AKD remain unknown. How-
ever, infectious diseases can be an important selective force shap-
ing the evolution, ecology, behavior, and community structure of
host species (7). Infectious disease has also been recognized as an
important factor in wildlife declines and extinctions (8). In par-
ticular, pathogens can (i) cause deterministic population declines
directly if they kill hosts more quickly than hosts reproduce and
(ii) suppress the size or growth rates of populations, making them
more vulnerable to stochastic events. Small and otherwise sensi-
tive populations are at particularly high risk from infectious dis-
eases, and this threat increases dramatically when the pathogen
infects multiple host species, which can then act as pathogen
reservoirs (9). Infectious disease can also be problematic for spe-
cies recovery programs (e.g., proventricular dilatation disease
[PDD]), caused by a novel bornavirus, has hindered attempts to
preserve the Spix’s macaw (Cyanopsitta spixii) (10).
The high prevalence, apparent high mortality rate, and wide-
spread nature of AKD among multiple host species suggest that
this pathology has the potential to have broad-ranging and nega-
tive impacts on wild bird populations. Epidemiological studies of
AKD revealed that 6.5% of adult Alaskan BCCH are affected by

 AKD, a rate of beak deformities far greater than any previously
known from wild birds, which typically exhibit frequencies of
beak deformities of less than 1% (1). Meanwhile, similar deformi-
ties have been documented relatively frequently in numerous
other species in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest region of North
America, most notably among corvids; e.g., northwestern crows
(NOCR [Corvus caurinus]), red-breasted nuthatches (RBNH
[Sitta canadensis]), and raptors (1, 11; C. M. Anderson, personal
communication to C. M. Handel). Morphologically similar defor-
mities have been observed in more than 24 avian species in North
America and 36 species in the United Kingdom (1, 12). However,
despite the similarity of the gross pathology observed in multiple
species, it remains unknown whether a common factor is respon-
sible, in part because the cause of AKD remains elusive (4).
The identification of the causative agent of AKD will be key to
determining whether the beak pathologies observed across species
represent a multispecies pandemic. It is also a vital step toward
evaluating the prevalence and impact of the disease, assessing pop-
ulation resistance, and developing an effective response to out-
breaks, including the development of preventive policies, vac-
cines, or treatments as needed. There is a wide range of causes that
can underlie beak deformities, including contaminants, nutri-
tional deficiencies, trauma and infectious agents (13). Previous
studies did not find clear evidence of a nutrient deficiency or con-
taminant exposure underlying AKD (4, 14, 15). Histopathological
examination of the beaks of black-capped chickadee with AKD
showed evidence of bacterial or fungal infection in a small portion
of individuals examined, but the pattern of infection with these
agents was not consistent across AKD-affected individuals (4).
Transmission electron microscopy revealed features compatible
with viral particles in some but not all affected birds (4). These
observations were further supported by histopathological evi-
dence of intranuclear inclusions in the beaks of AKD-affected but
not unaffected birds, possibly indicative of a viral infection (4).
These findings, along with the rapid emergence of this pathology
both geographically and across species (1, 11) are consistent with
an infectious etiology. However, the absence of a candidate agent
has hindered progress in investigating this enigmatic disorder.
Metagenomic methods for the discovery of pathogens have
revolutionized the ability to detect and identify candidate etio-
logic agents in the case of infectious diseases with unknown cause.
We applied unbiased, high-throughput metagenomic sequencing
to search for candidate causes of AKD. Using this methodology,
we identified and assembled the complete coding region of a novel
picornavirus, which we have named poecivirus after the genus of
the host in which it was first detected. We then screened 19 AKD-
affected BCCH and 9 control individuals for the presence of poe-
civirus by using targeted PCR primers followed by Sanger se-
quencing. In addition, we conducted opportunistic screening of
two NOCR and two RBNH with AKD-consistent pathology for
the presence of poecivirus. Here, we describe histopathological
findings and tissue tropism, analyze the genome of this novel virus
in the context of related viruses, and present data that identify
poecivirus as a candidate etiological agent of AKD.
RESULTS
Metagenomic investigation of AKD. Unbiased sequencing of
pooled RNA from 8 individuals with AKD (Table 1) on the Illu-
mina HiSeq platform generated approximately 1 � 107 50-
nucleotide single-read sequences. We filtered the resulting reads
(see Materials and Methods). We then assembled the remaining
sequences into contiguous sequences (contigs) using the Trinity
de novo assembler (16) and compared the assemblies to the NCBI
nonredundant nucleotide (nt) and protein (nr) databases using
BLAST. This search revealed 2 large contigs (3,299 nt and 4,560 nt)
with similarities to avian picornaviruses (i.e., 21 to 27% pairwise
nucleotide identity with pigeon mesiviruses). We manually as-
sembled these contigs into a 7.6-kb sequence, accounting for most
of the genome, including the full open reading frame (ORF), of a
novel picornavirus (NCBI accession number KU977108). Retro-
spective mapping of the sequenced reads from the 8 AKD-positive
beaks revealed that the pool of these samples contained approxi-
mately 21,000 viral sequences (0.04% of the total reads), with a
mean viral-genome coverage of 139 reads. We validated the as-
sembled sequence by Sanger sequencing (Fig. 2).
Phylogenetic relationships. Phylogenetic analysis of the full
polyprotein sequence (Fig. 3) and the 3C and 3D regions showed
poecivirus to be a distinct species separate from classified genera
and indicated that it is ancestral to the megriviruses, turkey hep-
atitis virus, and chicken picornavirus 4 and 5.
Genomic organization. Analysis of the recovered genome se-
quences revealed a nonsegmented positive-sense organization
and a single ORF 6,783 nucleotides long (2,260 amino acids)
(Fig. 2). Comparison of polyprotein sequences between BCCH
hosts showed little interindividual variation, with viral sequences
displaying 96.3% pairwise identity, indicating that the same viral
species is present in all infected BCCH.
Poecivirus follows the typical picornavirus organization, with
the single ORF coding for a polyprotein that includes the P1 re-
gion (structural proteins) and the P2 and P3 regions (nonstruc-
tural proteins involved in protein processing and genome replica-
tion) (17). To further investigate the relationship between this and
previously described picornaviruses, we conducted comparative
analyses of the ORF (Fig. 2). The predicted polyprotein is most
closely related to those of avian picornaviruses, sharing 28.5%,
27.8%, and 27.7% amino acid identity with duck megrivirus and
pigeon mesivirus 1 and 2, respectively. Possible cleavage sites of
the polyprotein were Q/x and E/x (where lowercase x is a noncon-
served amino acid) (Fig. 2); these cleavage sites are supported by
NetPicoRNA (18) and by the alignment of the amino acid se-

(NCBI accession numbers YP_009030047, AGS15016, and
AGW95843).
Analysis of the coding regions. In the P1 region, the greatest
sequence conservation between poecivirus and its closest relative,
duck megrivirus, occurs in viral protein 3 (VP3) and VP0 (Fig. 2).
Analysis of the P1 region did not support the presence of an L
protein. This observation is in line with the reported lack of an L
protein in pigeon mesiviruses and turkey hepatitis virus (NCBI
accession number ADN94256) (19, 20). Alignments with se-
quences from close relatives (duck megrivirus and pigeon mesivi-
rus 1 and 2) and NetPicoRNA (18) support cleavage of the P1
polyprotein at positions Y112/N, Q293/I, Q531/S, and Y778/G, result-
ing in the capsid proteins VP4, VP2, VP3, and VP1 (Fig. 2). The P1
region exhibited homology to the picornavirus capsid protein
domain-like superfamily cluster cd00205 between amino acid res-
idues 126 to 256, 382 to 518, and 558 to 717 (with E values of
4.02e�15, 2.57e�13, and 1.14e�06, respectively). VP0, the pre-
cursor of VP4 and VP2, contains multiple myristylation motifs
typical of picornaviruses (Gxxx[T/S]), which are likely to be im-
portant for capsid assembly or entry of viral particles into host
cells (21); these are located at G28, G52, and G87.
The P2 region of poecivirus is approximately 570 amino acids
shorter than those of duck megrivirus and pigeon mesivirus, re-

 sulting in large part from differences in the 2A region. While duck
megrivirus and pigeon mesivirus appear to have multiple 2A pro-
teins (20, 22), poecivirus has a single 2A protein made up of just
97 amino acids, likely originating from a predicted cleavage from
2B at position E875/C. The poecivirus 2A protein does not exhibit
sequence homology to any known picornavirus. The 2A protein
does not contain the NPGP motif that facilitates C-terminal ter-
mination in aphthoviruses, avihepatoviruses, cardioviruses, erbo-
viruses, senecaviruses, and teschoviruses (19). The poecivirus 2A
protein also lacks the H box NC motifs seen in hepatoviruses,
kobuviruses, parechoviruses, and tremoviruses (19). Neither
amino acid sequence homology, structural modeling using
HHPRED, nor manual inspection revealed a putative proteinase
catalytic triad in the 2A protein. Therefore, the function of the 2A
protein in this virus remains unknown. The 2B and 2C proteins
are predicted to be processed by cleavage at the Q1062/E and
Q1408/Q sites. The 2C region contains the highly conserved
GxxGXGKS motif (where uppercase X represents an uncharged
amino acid; G1199DPGVGKS) for NTP-binding sites but not the
DDLxQ motif for putative helicase activity (23, 24).
Cleavage of the P3 region at sites Q1559/A, Q1586/S, and E1852/G
is predicted to generate the 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D proteins. Poecivi-
rus 3A shows 23.2% and 23.8% pairwise identity to those of pi-
geon mesivirus 1 and 2 but no homology to that of duck megrivi-
rus, its closest relative when considering the entire polyprotein
sequence. The 3B protein contains a conserved tyrosine in posi-
tion 3, which is present in the VPg proteins of all known picorna-
viruses and is required for viral RNA replication (17). The 3C
protein contains the conserved motif GxCG (GTC1737G), which
typically houses the active-site cysteine in picornaviruses (23)
(Fig. 2). Comparison to similar sequences using structural mod-
eling (HHPRED) suggests a putative catalytic triad of H1625 D1644
C1737. Not surprisingly, the 3D region, which forms the polymer-
ase required for viral replication (17), exhibits the highest homol-
ogy to those of other picornaviruses, with 50.2% pairwise amino
acid identity to its closest relatives (pigeon mesivirus 1 and 2). The
3D protein sequence (amino acids 1863 to 2260) exhibits homol-
ogy to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDRPs; family
PF00680) and contains several highly conserved motifs present
in RDRPs (KDELR, GGxPSG, YGDD, and FLKR; K1952DELR;
G2081GMPSG, Y2121GDD, and F2170LKR) (Fig. 2).
Prevalence, tropism, and histopathology. Having character-
ized the sequence and genomic organization of poecivirus, we
determined the infection status of 19 AKD-affected BCCH and 9
unaffected individuals using targeted PCR followed by Sanger se-
quencing (see Materials and Methods). Of the AKD-affected
BCCH, 19 of 19 (100%) tested positive for poecivirus via PCR,
while 2 of 9 (22%) unaffected individuals tested positive; thus,
individuals with AKD were significantly more likely to be infected
with poecivirus than expected by chance (P � 0.0001, likelihood-
ratio chi-square test).
When we tested multiple tissues to determine viral tropism, we
detected poecivirus in all tissues sampled from each bird (Fig. 4).
While it is not possible to draw conclusions regarding tropism
given the small number of individuals sampled, it is noteworthy
that the viral load was highest in either the cloaca or the beak,
depending on the individual. Interestingly, cloacal swabs exhib-
ited relative viral loads that were as high or higher than those in
samples of cloaca tissue, suggesting that swabs provide a relatively
noninvasive approach to sample individuals for infection with
poecivirus. The viral loads in the two BCCH unaffected by AKD
that tested positive for poecivirus were within the range of the viral
RNA levels observed in AKD-affected BCCH; beak samples from
individuals 596 and 601, both unaffected by AKD, contained 0.025
and 0.027 viral RNAs per host RNA (a level of viral RNA compa-
rable to that of individual 955, affected by AKD).
As previously documented, histopathological examination of
individuals with AKD showed hyperkeratosis, increased eosino-
philia, and incomplete maturation of corneocytes (4). Individual
498, afflicted with the most extreme overgrowth of any BCCH in
this study (with a beak of over 40 mm in length), exhibited koilo-
cytotic keratinocytes, with nuclear irregularities and perinuclear

 halo (Fig. 5). Interestingly, vacuolated keratinocytes, or koilo-
cytotic changes, are characteristic of virally induced cytopathic
changes that accompany hyperkeratosis in verruca vulgaris
(common warts caused by infection with human papillomavi-
rus); however, we could not find evidence of papillomavirus in
our metagenomic deep-sequencing data from AKD-affected
BCCH.
In vitro virus culture. To further characterize this virus, we
attempted to develop in vitro viral growth conditions using duck
embryo, chicken embryo, and QT6 (quail) cells; however, we were
unsuccessful. Viral RNA was initially detectable in the inoculum
(prepared from virus-positive beak and other tissues) and super-
natant but disappeared rapidly and remained undetectable for
72 days. This suggests that these cell lines or the culture conditions
that we used were not permissive for viral replication, that the cell
lines used might not express the receptor(s) used by poecivirus to
gain entry into cells, or that the inoculum that we used did not
contain replication-competent virus.

 Additional species. The two NOCR and two RBNH with elon-
gated beaks all tested positive for poecivirus via PCR using
poecivirus-specific primers that target the 5= untranslated region
(UTR) and the P1 region. Sanger sequencing of the PCR pro-
ducts revealed virus with high nucleotide identity to the poeci-
virus detected in BCCH (NCBI accession numbers KU986726,
KU986727,
KU986728,
KU986729,
KU986730,
KU986731,

(NOCR 674), 91.8% (NOCR 848), and 92.5% (RBNH 12 and 929)
nucleotide identities with the BCCH poecivirus, while a 300-bp
sequence in the P1 region displayed 92.0% (NOCR 674, 848),
91.0% (RBNH 12), and 91.3% (RBNH 929) nucleotide identities
with the BCCH poecivirus. Across this region, virus from NOCR
exhibited 24 mutations, of which 23/24 (95.8%) were synony-
mous with the virus detected in BCCH; meanwhile, the virus from
RBNH exhibited 28 (RBNH 12) and 26 (RBNH 929) mutations, of
which 27/28 (96.4%) and 25/26 (96.2%), respectively, were syn-
onymous with the virus from BCCH. Furthermore, phylogenetic
analysis of this region shows that the RBNH viruses were more
closely related to each other than to viruses isolated from the other
species and that the NOCR viruses were more closely related to
each other than to viruses isolated from the other species. In ad-
dition, viruses isolated from RBNH and NOCR were more diver-
gent from the BCCH-isolated poeciviruses than the BCCH viruses
were from each other; this is consistent with the possibility of
adaptation to particular host species.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we used next-generation sequencing to investigate
potential causes of avian keratin disorder (AKD), an emerging
epizootic of beak deformities affecting numerous species across
continents. Focusing on Alaskan BCCH, we found evidence of a
single pathogen in the beaks of AKD-affected individuals: a novel
picornavirus that we have named poecivirus. While we cannot
rule out the presence of additional pathogens in other tissues, we
did detect a strong, statistically significant correlation between
poecivirus and AKD. Specifically, poecivirus was present in 19/19
(100%) AKD-affected BCCH and 2/9 (22%) control individuals.
In addition to the correlation between poecivirus infection and
AKD in BCCH, we detected poecivirus in two NOCR and two
RBNH with elongated beaks. Importantly, poecivirus is not the
first picornavirus associated with hyperkeratosis; Seneca Valley
virus has been associated with hyperkeratosis in pigs (25).
Complete polyprotein analyses of poecivirus reveal a novel vi-
rus whose closest relatives are all avian picornaviruses, including
megriviruses, turkey hepatitis virus, and chicken picornaviruses 4
and 5. While the polyprotein exhibits characteristic picornaviral
organization and motifs, including picornavirus-like capsid do-
mains and typical motifs in the 2C, 3C, and 3D functional do-
mains, it is distinct from known picornaviruses. According to the
Picornaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on
Taxonomy of Viruses (http://www.picornastudygroup.com/defi-
nitions/genus_definition.htm), novel picornavirus genera are de-
fined by amino acid identities in the P1, P2, and P3 regions of
�40%, �40%, and �50%, respectively. Poecivirus exhibits
�34%, �25%, and �48% identity to any known picornaviruses
in the P1, P2, and P3 regions, respectively. This, along with lack of
homology in the 2A, 2B, and 3A regions between poecivirus and
its closest relatives indicates that poecivirus likely represents a new
genus of picornavirus.

 though knowledge of the family taxonomy is changing rapidly,
with 9 new genera approved in 2014 alone. While the family in-
cludes 22 fully sequenced picornavirus species isolated from avian
species, only a few these are known from wild bird species, includ-
ing turdivirus 1 and 2 (26) and pigeon picornaviruses A and B
(27). The known turdiviruses were found in samples from expired
birds, and the pigeon picornaviruses were found during random
sampling; as a result, we know little about the impacts of any
picornavirus infection on wild birds. In domestic avian species,
picornavirus infection can cause a variety of pathologies, ranging
from subclinical infection to reduced growth rates to high mortal-
ity rates; however, it is primarily juvenile birds that are affected by
these viruses (19, 28, 29). In contrast, AKD is documented primar-
ily in adult birds, rarely causes overt disease in juveniles, and has
not been documented in nestlings of either BCCH or other species
studied (1, 11); however, symptoms other than beak overgrowth
in juveniles and nestlings may have gone unnoticed. If poecivirus
is the underlying cause of AKD, it is causing pathology in a man-
ner substantially different from known avian picornaviruses.
Furthermore, if poecivirus is the cause of AKD across species,
then it shows many of the hallmarks of a pathogen of concern
from a conservation perspective. The available data suggest that
mortality rates from this disease can be high among the adult
breeding population; this could result in deterministic population
declines if individuals are dying faster than they are replaced by
recruitment of juveniles or migrants. In addition, avian picorna-
viruses characteristically decrease juvenile growth and survival
(19, 28, 29); it remains unknown whether the causative agent of
AKD has similar impacts on juveniles. If it does, this has the po-
tential to limit recruitment of new individuals into breeding pop-
ulations, making populations more vulnerable to stochastic
events, such as high mortality due to adverse weather conditions.
Finally, the apparently broad range of hosts affected by AKD sug-
gests the potential for a large disease reservoir from which this
pathogen could spill over into small, naive, or otherwise sensitive
populations (9).
It is worth noting that two individuals with apparently normal
beaks tested positive for poecivirus. This could indicate that poe-
civirus is not related to AKD; however, poecivirus was present in
significantly more AKD-affected birds than unaffected individu-
als, suggesting that either it is the causative agent of AKD or AKD
promotes infection with poecivirus. Certainly, definitive identifi-
cation of individuals affected by AKD remains a challenge; the
appearance of a gross beak deformity is the primary means of
diagnosis, and yet, given the time required for a beak to become
measurably elongated, the causative agent must be present before
visible signs of deformity have appeared. As a result, it is possible
that the two apparently unaffected birds that tested positive for
poecivirus may have been in an early stage of infection, before
sufficient time had passed for them to grow the elongated beak
that defines AKD. Indeed, while 18 of the 19 individuals in this
study that were classified as being affected by AKD had clearly
deformed, elongated beaks, the remaining individual had a long
but not obviously deformed beak and evidence of AKD at the
cellular level (individual 738). All 19 of these individuals tested
positive for the presence of poecivirus. It is also possible that some
individuals exhibit subclinical infection (as has been suggested for
related viruses [28]) or that coinfection with other pathogens or
some other environmental trigger is needed to initiate the over-
growth of the beak keratin. For example, in the case of turkey viral
hepatitis, thought to be caused by a picornavirus, clinical symp-
toms only become overt when individuals are stressed (19).
AKD is an emerging disease of wild birds that has been increas-
ing both in geographic scope and in the variety of species affected.
The strong association between poecivirus and AKD in BCCH
suggests that this is a promising candidate for the causative agent
of AKD. It is noteworthy that AKD appears to affect an incredibly
wide range of avian species. Several lines of evidence (i.e., the
concurrent emergence of AKD across species and the geographic
proximity of such clusters) lend support to the idea that multiple
species are being afflicted by a disease with a common etiology. In
keeping with this, we found poecivirus to be present in 4/4 indi-
viduals with overgrown beaks from 2 additional species (NOCR
and RBNH). However, control individuals from these species
were not available for testing at the time of this study; screening of
additional species with AKD-like deformities for the presence of
poecivirus and sequencing of poecivirus from a greater variety
of species will be necessary to further test the association between
poecivirus and AKD. In addition, next-generation sequencing
would be required to obtain the full viral genome from each of
these hosts to confirm that they are infected by poecivirus, as
opposed to a related but distinct species of virus. Finally, viral
challenge experiments will be required to demonstrate with
certainty that poecivirus is the cause of AKD. In the absence of
an in vitro system for growing wild-type virus, one possible
alternative would be to use in vitro-transcribed RNA derived
from a full-length cDNA of the poecivirus genome to transfect
cultured cells; this would bypass a potential block to viral entry
of cultured cells if, for example, cells used in culture lacked the
appropriate receptor.
In conclusion, the association between poecivirus and AKD
warrants further investigation. The use of cloacal and/or buccal
swabs to test individuals for infection with poecivirus provides a
nonterminal method of sampling individuals for poecivirus infec-
tion that will make sampling large numbers of AKD-affected in-
dividuals substantially more feasible. The sampling of larger num-
bers of individuals, together with metagenomic characterization
of other affected species, the development of an in vitro culture
system, and viral challenge of healthy individuals will provide the
information necessary to determine with certainty the clinical
contribution of poecivirus to AKD and to elucidate both the
pathogenesis and transmission potential of this virus. Ulti-
mately, identifying the causative agent of AKD is vital in order
to monitor the impact of this disease on wild bird populations,
understand the causes underlying current disease emergence, and
determine the possibility of and necessity for interventions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study species. The majority of the research documenting, describing, and
investigating AKD has been conducted in BCCH (1, 2, 4, 6, 14). Further-
more, AKD has been documented in thousands of BCCH; this is an order
of magnitude more affected individuals than have been documented in
any other species (1). For these reasons, and because it is unknown
whether similar deformities in other species represent the same pathology,
we focus our investigation on BCCH.
Sample collection. Nineteen BCCH with AKD (Table 1) were trapped
using funnel traps and mist nets in Anchorage and the Matanuska-Susitna
Valley, Alaska, during the nonbreeding season from 2001 to 2015. Stan-
dard beak measurements were used to classify individuals as AKD affected
or unaffected (1). Briefly, an individual was considered AKD affected if it
had a nares-to-tip length (chord measurement from anterior end of the

 right nare to the tip of the upper beak) of �8.1 mm or evidence of hyper-
keratosis at the cellular level. The 9 individuals with AKD that were col-
lected from 2001 to 2010 were euthanized upon capture with isoflurane
using the open-drop method and stored frozen at �20°C; the remaining
10 specimens were captured in the winter of 2014 and spring of 2015,
euthanized, and stored overnight at 4°C prior to necropsy, at which time
portions of tissues were frozen at �80°C and additional samples were
placed in formalin. From 2 of these, we collected cloacal and buccal swabs
prior to euthanasia (individuals 331 and 971); the swabs were stored in
Longmire buffer (30). Nine individuals not affected by AKD were col-
lected opportunistically between 1995 and 2010 and stored frozen at
�20°C. To ensure that we did not classify individuals in the early stages of
AKD as unaffected due to lack of gross morphological deformities, we
examined beak tissue of individuals with apparently normal beaks via
histopathology. As positive controls, we also examined the beaks of four
AKD-affected individuals (individuals 600, 451, 263, and 498). Histo-
pathological analysis was performed by T. Tihan and was done blind as to
individual AKD status and picornavirus infection status. In addition, we
opportunistically obtained two NOCR and two RBNH with overgrown
beaks. One NOCR was submitted to a wildlife rehabilitation center in
Alaska and euthanized, while the other crow was collected as part of air-
port safety measures. The two RBNH were collected after dying in the
wild.
All work was conducted with the approval of the U.S. Geological Sur-
vey (USGS) Alaska Science Center Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (assurance no. 2011-2) and under appropriate state and fed-
eral permits.
Virus discovery: sample processing for high-throughput sequenc-
ing. Tissue samples from 8 BCCH with AKD were processed for the initial
metagenomic deep sequencing (Table 1). To extract RNA, half of a man-
dible from each individual was ground using a mortar and pestle on liquid
nitrogen and then added to 1 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and pro-
cessed following the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA quantity and quality
were determined by spectroscopy. Comparable amounts of RNA from
beak samples of each of the 8 BCCH were combined into a single pool and
prepped for high-throughput sequencing using Illumina’s TruSeq RNA
kit with the Ribo-Zero RNA kit.
Sequence analysis. Following default Illumina quality filtering, low-
quality sequences containing any Ns and low-complexity sequences
(Lempel-Ziv-Welch ratio of less than 0.45) were removed (31). The first 6
bases of each sequence were trimmed (these correspond to the random
hexamer used to tag library molecules). Bird sequences were identified
using the BLASTN alignment tool (version 2.2.21 [17]) to query a data-
base composed of chicken, zebra finch, and quail genomes, and sequences
aligning with an expected value of less than 10�8 were filtered. Similarly,
sequences that aligned with the Illumina adapter sequences or to �X174
control sequence were removed. The remaining sequences were assem-
bled into contiguous sequences using the Trinity de novo assembler (16).
The resulting sequences were searched against the NCBI nonredundant
nucleotide (nt) and protein (nr) databases. Only sequences whose best
hits were to viral sequences were considered further. For coverage infor-
mation, reads were aligned to Sanger-validated assemblies using the Bow-
tie2 software, version 2.0.0 (32). Analysis of the polyprotein for putative
cleavage sites was conducted using the NetPicoRNA program, which pre-
dicts cleavage sites of picornaviral proteases (18), and by the alignment of
the amino acid sequence to close relatives (i.e., duck megrivirus and pi-
geon mesivirus 1 and 2; NCBI accession numbers YP_009030047,
AGS15016, and AGW95843). We also used the more sensitive HHPRED
hidden Markov model-based alignment and structure prediction software
tool to search for more distant homologies (33).
Sanger sequencing. The viral genome assembled from deep-sequencing
reads was validated by Sanger sequencing (primers are listed in Table S1 in
the supplemental material). Briefly, 200 ng of RNA was reverse tran-
scribed in 10-�l reaction mixtures containing 100-pmol random hex-
amer, 1� reaction buffer, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 1.25 mM (each) deoxy-
nucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), and 100 U SuperScript III (Life
Technologies); the mixtures were incubated at 25°C for 5 min, 42°C for
60 min, and 70°C for 15 min. The PCR mixtures contained 1� iProof
master mix, 0.5 �M primer, and 5 �l cDNA. Thermocycling consisted of
98°C for 30 s, 40 to 45 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 58°C for 10 s, and 72°C for
30 s, and a final elongation step of 72°C for 5 min. Amplicons were visu-
alized using agarose gels; those in the correct size range were purified using
a DNA Clean & Concentrator kit or Zymoclean gel DNA recovery kit
(Zymo) and Sanger sequenced (Quintara Biosciences).
Phylogenetic analysis. All available picornavirus polyprotein and
protein sequences were downloaded from NCBI. Multiple-sequence
alignments were created using ClustalW alignment in Geneious (version
8.0.4) with free-end gaps; otherwise, default settings were used.
Maximum-likelihood phylogenies were created using PhyML (PhyML
plugin for Geneious version 2.2.0) with the LG model of amino acid sub-
stitutions, 100 bootstrap replicates, and otherwise default parameters
(34).
qPCR. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to determine viral tropism
and monitor viral RNA levels in culture experiments. RNA was extracted
with a Quick-RNA miniprep kit (tissue) or ZR viral RNA kit (tissue cul-
ture) (Zymo). RNA was reverse transcribed as described above; the qPCR
mixtures contained 1� LC480 Sybr green master mix (Roche), 0.1 �M
each primer (see Table S1 in the supplemental material), and 5 �l of
1:20-diluted cDNA.
Tissue culture. Duck embryo (CCL-141), chicken embryo (CRL-
12203), and quail QT6 cells were obtained from the ATCC (American
Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and were grown at 37°C and 5%
CO2. Duck embryo cells were grown in Eagle’s minimum essential me-
dium (ATCC), while chicken embryo cells were grown in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (ATCC); both were supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 �g/ml streptomycin.
QT6 cells were grown in Ham’s F-12K medium (ATCC) with 2 mM
L-glutamine adjusted to contain 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, supple-
mented with 10% tryptose phosphate broth, 5% fetal bovine serum,
50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 �g/ml streptomycin.
For inoculation experiments, portions of frozen, virus-positive beak,
heart, brain, cloaca, kidney, liver, and ventriculus samples were minced
with scalpels, suspended in serum-free DMEM containing 25 mM HEPES
(pH 7.4), homogenized with a pellet pestle or Dounce homogenizer
(beak), and placed on ice for 30 min. The homogenates were clarified by
centrifugation at 10,000 � g for 1 min, filtered through a 0.2-�m filter,
diluted 1:60, and used to inoculate cell cultures. The cells were visually
monitored for evidence of infection, and the supernatants were moni-
tored for the presence of viral particles using quantitative real-time PCR
(qRT-PCR).
Testing for an association between poecivirus and avian keratin dis-
order. We tested for the presence of poecivirus in tissue samples from the
8 AKD-affected BCCH subjected to metagenomic deep sequencing, from
11 additional BCCH with AKD, and from 9 control BCCH. Half of a
mandible from each black-capped chickadee was ground using a mortar
and pestle on liquid nitrogen, and RNA was extracted using a Zymo
Quick-RNA miniprep kit. In some cases, the cloaca was also tested; the
cloaca was homogenized using a pellet pestle, and RNA was extracted
using a Zymo Quick-RNA miniprep kit and reverse transcribed as de-
scribed above. Samples were screened via PCR using poecivirus-specific
primers (see Table S1 in the supplemental material), and amplicons were
Sanger sequenced as described above, with a slight difference in the ther-
mocycling: the thermocycling consisted of 98°C for 30 s, 40 to 45 cycles of
98°C for 10 s, 58°C for 10 s, and 72°C for 30 s, and then a 5-min elongation
step of 72°C. Positive PCR results were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.
We tested two NOCR and two RBNH with elongated beaks for the pres-
ence of poecivirus in the same manner, using primers BCCHpic_1F and
BCCHpic_1R (see Table S1) and BCCHpic_2F and BCCHpic_2FR.
Tropism. Viral tropism was examined in four BCCH (individuals 738,
331, 955, and 971) via qPCR (as described above). We measured the levels
