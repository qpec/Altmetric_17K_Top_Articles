Abstract
Background: The cost-effectiveness of population-based panel testing for high- and moderate-penetrance ovarian cancer
(OC)/breast cancer (BC) gene mutations is unknown. We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of population-based BRCA1/BRCA2/
RAD51C/RAD51D/BRIP1/PALB2 mutation testing compared with clinical criteria/family history (FH) testing in unselected gen-
eral population women.
Methods: A decision-analytic model comparing lifetime costs and effects of criteria/FH-based BRCA1/BRCA2 testing is com-
pared with BRCA1/BRCA2/RAD51C/RAD51D/BRIP1/PALB2 testing in those fulfilling clinical criteria/strong FH of cancer (�10%
BRCA1/BRCA2 probability) and all women age 30 years or older. Analyses are presented for UK and US populations. Identified
carriers undergo risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy. BRCA1/BRCA2/PALB2 carriers can opt for magnetic resonance imag-
ing/mammography, chemoprevention, or risk-reducing mastectomy. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) en-
abled model uncertainty evaluation. Outcomes include OC, BC, and additional heart disease deaths. Quality-adjusted life-
years (QALYs), OC incidence, BC incidence, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were calculated. The time horizon
is lifetime and perspective is payer.
Results: Compared with clinical criteria/FH-based BRCA1/BRCA2 testing, clinical criteria/FH-based BRCA1/BRCA2/RAD51C/
RAD51D/BRIP1/PALB2 testing is cost-effective (ICER ¼ £7629.65/QALY or $49 282.19/QALY; 0.04 days’ life-expectancy gained).
Population-based testing for BRCA1/BRCA2/RAD51C/RAD51D/BRIP1/PALB2 mutations is the most cost-effective strategy com-
pared with current policy: ICER ¼ £21 599.96/QALY or $54 769.78/QALY (9.34 or 7.57 days’ life-expectancy gained). At £30 000/
QALY and $100 000/QALY willingness-to-pay thresholds, population-based BRCA1/BRCA2/RAD51C/RAD51D/BRIP1/PALB2 panel
testing is the preferred strategy in 83.7% and 92.7% of PSA simulations; criteria/FH-based panel testing is preferred in 16.2%
and 5.8% of simulations, respectively. Population-based BRCA1/BRCA2/RAD51C/RAD51D/BRIP1/PALB2 testing can prevent
1.86%/1.91% of BC and 3.2%/4.88% of OC in UK/US women: 657/655 OC cases and 2420/2386 BC cases prevented per million.

 Conclusions: Population-based BRCA1/BRCA2/RAD51C/RAD51D/BRIP1/PALB2 testing is more cost-effective than any clinical
criteria/FH-based strategy. Clinical criteria/FH-based BRCA1/BRCA2/RAD51C/RAD51D/BRIP1/PALB2 testing is more cost-
effective than BRCA1/BRCA2 testing alone.
Our existing health care structure is directed predominantly
toward treatment rather than illness prevention. Advances in ge-
nomic medicine are being used to guide novel cancer treatment
strategies. However, they also offer the opportunity to deliver a
new population-based predictive, preventive, personalized, and
participatory
(P4)
medicine
strategy
for
cancer
prevention.
Traditionally ovarian cancer (OC)/breast cancer (BC) prevention
has been targeted at high-risk individuals like BRCA1/BRCA2 mu-
tation carriers. At-risk mutation carriers can opt for risk-reducing
salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) to reduce their OC risk (1,2),
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/mammography screening,
risk-reducing mastectomy (RRM) (3), or chemoprevention with se-
lective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM) to reduce their BC
risk (4), as well as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) (5).
Identification of mutation carriers (eg, BRCA1/BRCA2) at high risk
of OC/BC has involved genetic testing of affected individuals or
those from high-risk families in specialized genetics clinics.
Clinical criteria/family history (FH) is a surrogate for BRCA proba-
bility, with testing offered above a certain threshold. However,
clinical criteria/FH-based testing is only moderately effective at
identifying mutations and has poor ability to rule out the absence
of one (6). We (7) and others (8,9) have shown that this approach
misses more than 50% of mutation carriers. Given the effective
options available for OC and BC risk management/prevention,
this raises serious questions about the adequacy of a clinical
criteria/FH-based approach. Additionally, lately, newer interme-
diate/moderate-risk OC genes RAD51C (10), RAD51D (11), and
BRIP1 (OC risk �5%–9%) (12) have been identified and their pene-
trance estimates validated (13,14). Furthermore, our recent mod-
eling work strongly suggests that RRSO would be cost-effective at
4% to 5% OC risk (15,16). This enables clinical utility and supports
implementation of clinical testing for these gene mutations.
Among the newer moderate-risk BC-genes, PALB2 is the one that
confers nonsyndromic quasi-Mendelian susceptibility to BC (BC
risk ¼ 44%) (17), for which equivalent interventions (RRM/breast
MRI) are now offered to mutation carriers. ATM and CHEK-2 have
lower moderate risks (relative risk [RR] � 1.5–2) that don’t justify
RRM. Testing for these, though commercially available, is not cur-
rently routinely undertaken in clinical practice (18,19).
The limitations of clinical criteria/FH-based ascertainment
can be overcome by population-based testing. Next-generation
sequencing technologies (20,21) with high-throughput multiplex
panel testing, falling costs, and advances in computational bioin-
formatics has made population testing feasible. In a prospective
randomized trial, we showed that compared with FH-based test-
ing, population-based BRCA1/BRCA2 testing in Ashkenazi Jews
(AJ) is acceptable, feasible, can be undertaken in a community
setting, doesn’t harm psychological health/quality of life, identi-
fies more than 50% of additional carriers, reduces BC and OC
incidence, and is extremely cost-effective (incremental cost-
effectiveness ratio [ICER] ¼ –£2079/quality-adjusted life-year
[QALY]) (7,22). While there is good evidence to support a change
in the clinical paradigm from clinical criteria/FH to population-
based testing in Ashkenazi Jews (23), a population-based ap-
proach has not yet been properly evaluated in the non-Jewish
general population. A health-economic assessment is crucial for
evaluating and comparing the efficacy of different health inter-
ventions. This helps allocate resources across interventions and
set policy to improve population health. Here we use a decision
analysis model to compare the costs and effects of clinical crite-
ria/FH and population testing approaches for the known high-
and moderate-penetrance OC/BC gene mutations BRCA1, BRCA2,
RAD51C, RAD51D, BRIP1, and PALB2.
Methods
This analysis was approved by the Genetic Cancer Prediction
through Population Screening (GCaPPS) study from the Institute
of Child Health/Great Ormond Street Hospital Research Ethics
Committee (REC reference number 08/H0713/44).
Decision Model
A decision-analytic model (Figure 1) was developed to compare
the lifetime costs and effects of genetically testing all non-
Jewish women age 30 years or older for BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51C,
RAD51D, BRIP1, and PALB2 mutations compared with the current
practice of clinical criteria/FH-based testing (based on � 10%
BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation probability alone) (19). We present sepa-
rate analyses for both UK and US populations. The standard
clinical criteria/FH-based testing for BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations is
compared in an incremental fashion with Strategy A: clinical
criteria/FH-based
panel
testing
for
BRCA1/BRCA2/RAD51C/
RAD51D/BRIP1/PALB2 mutations; and Strategy B: population-
testing for BRCA1/BRCA2/RAD51C/RAD51D/BRIP1/PALB2 muta-
tions. The model assumes that all women in the population
screening arm and only those fulfilling clinical/FH criteria in the
FH arm are offered genetic counseling and genetic testing. We
assume that 71% will uptake genetic testing (from GCaPPS
study) (7). The cost of pretest counseling is included (24,25).
BRCA1/BRCA2-negative women are tested for RAD51C/RAD51D/
BRIP1/PALB2 mutations (from the same DNA sample). A detailed
description of all model assumptions is given in Supplementary
Table 1 (available online). The model incorporates the increased
risk of cardiovascular mortality (absolute increase ¼ 3.03%)
reported
with
premenopausal
bilateral-oophorectomy
in
women who don’t take hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
(26,27). Model outcomes included OC, BC, and excess deaths
from heart disease. As per the National Institute of Health and
Care Excellence (NICE) economic evaluation guidelines, costs
and outcomes are discounted at 3.5% (28).
Probabilities
We use the most up-to-date prevalence estimates for BRCA1/
BRCA2 (29) and RAD51C, RAD51D (14), BRIP1 (13), and PALB2 (30).
The probability of having a positive FH or fulfilling clinical crite-
ria for non-AJ genetic testing is obtained from previously
unpublished
unselected
control population
data
from
the
Australian Breast Cancer Family Registry (ABCFR). The different
pathway probabilities are specified in Table 1 (explanation in
Supplementary Table 2, available online). Cancer incidence was
estimated by summing the probabilities of pathways ending in
OC or BC. The possibility of both OC and BC occurring simulta-
neously is rare and presumed close to zero. The potential

 population impact was calculated by translating reduction in BC
and OC incidence obtained across the population of non-AJ
UK/US women.
Costs
All costs (Supplementary Table 3, available online) are reported
at 2014 prices (31) and derived from a health care system/
payer’s perspective. Costs were converted wherever needed
using the Hospital and Community Health Service Index (32).
As per NICE recommendations, future health care costs not
associated with OC/BC or cardiovascular disease were not
considered (28).
Life-Years
The analysis has a lifetime time horizon covering lifetime risks
as well as long-term consequences. Female lifetables from the

mutations. The left half of the model reflects a clinical criteria/family history–based testing approach for the same. Each decision point in the model is called a “node,”
and each path extending from a node is called a decision “branch.” Each branch represents a mutually exclusive course or outcome. Each decision is given a probability
highlighted along the decision branch. The probabilities used in the model are explained in Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1 (available online). Values for each out-
come are calculated. Cancer incidence was estimated by summing the probabilities of pathways ending in ovarian or breast cancer. Final outcomes of each path in-
clude development of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, no breast/ovarian cancer, and excess deaths from coronary heart disease. BC ¼ breast cancer; CHD ¼ coronary
haeart disease; ICER ¼ incremental cost-effectiveness ratio; No OC or BC ¼ no ovarian cancer or breast cancer developed; OC ¼ ovarian cancer; QALY ¼ quality-adjusted
life-years; RRM ¼ risk-reducing mastectomy; RRSO ¼ risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy.

 Office of National Statistics (UK women) and Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER; US women) were used for
life expectancy data for women not developing OC/BC (33). To
simplify the analysis, we used average estimates for ages of on-
set and survival for BRCA1/BRCA2-related BC and OC. Details of
ages of onset and survival estimates used are in Supplementary
Table 4 (available online). The average ages for BC/OC were
44.4/59.6 years, respectively, for BRCA1þBRCA2 carriers (34). The
median ages of onset of sporadic OC/BC were 68/60 and 63/62
years
in
the
US
and
US
populations,
respectively
(from
CRUK/SEER) (35–37). OC/BC outcomes were modeled using
10-year survival data.
Quality-Adjusted Life-Years
QALYs are recommended by NICE as the most suitable sum-
mary measure for economic evaluation of health outcomes.
They adjust changes in length of life by potential alterations in
quality of life, and thus reflect both mortality and health-
related quality-of-life effects (28). QALY ¼ (survival in life-years)
� (utility weight). Calculating QALYs requires knowledge of util-
ity weights for each health state in the model. Utility weight is
an adjustment for quality of life. It indicates an individual’s
preference for a specific health state where 1 ¼ perfect health
and 0 ¼ death. The utility scores used are described in
Supplementary Table 5 (available online).
Analysis
Figure 1 illustrates the decision model. Path probabilities
(Supplementary Figure 1, available online) were multiplied to
calculate each branch probability. The total costs and effects in
terms of life-years and QALYs were estimated by weighting the
values for each branch by the branch probability. The ICER was
estimated by dividing the difference in cost by the difference in
effect between strategies. ICER ¼ (cost A – cost B)/(effect A –
effect B). This ICER obtained is compared with the cost-
effectiveness willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds from NICE of
less than £30 000/QALY (UK analysis) (38) and US $100 000/QALY
(US analysis) (39,40) to determine whether or not population
screening for all women can be cost-effective compared with
clinical criteria/FH-based testing. Additional scenario analyses
were also undertaken: 1) no benefit of reduction in BC risk,
2) varying genetic testing costs to define UK and US cost
thresholds for cost-effectiveness, 3) higher all-cause mortality
from premenopausal oophorectomy, and 4) lower RRSO/RRM
uptake.
Sensitivity analyses explored uncertainty in results and ro-
bustness of the model. In a one-way sensitivity analysis, each
model parameter is varied individually to evaluate impact on
results. Probabilities/utility weights were varied according to
95% confidence intervals/range, where available, or by þ/�10%.
Costs were varied by þ/�30%. Given that model parameters/var-
iables are likely to vary in parallel rather than independently,
probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was also undertaken
(28,41). It permits variables to be varied simultaneously across
their distributions and is recommended by NICE (28). The PSA
was fitted with appropriate distributions recommended in the
literature (probabilities ¼ beta; costs ¼ gamma; utilities ¼ log-
normal) (42). A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve plotted the
result of 10 000 simulations for all strategies. It depicts the pro-
portion of cost-effective simulations for each strategy at the
various
WTP
thresholds.
The
sum
of
the
(cost-effective)
proportions for all strategies taken together at any given WTP
threshold is always 1.
Results
The comparison of decision model outcomes of the three differ-
ent testing strategies for undiscounted and discounted lifetime
costs, life-years (survival), and QALYs is given for both UK and
US women in Table 2. Discounting reduces the overall cost dif-
ference as well as gain in life-years/QALYs. This is because
future costs/outcomes are adjusted by discounting and cost-
savings, which are generated through preventing future BCs/
OCs, which are considered lower in value. Our results show that
both newer strategies are cost-effective compared with the cur-
rent
clinical
criteria/FH-based
BRCA1/BRCA2
testing
policy.
Compared with clinical criteria/FH-based BRCA1/BRCA2 testing,
clinical
criteria/FH-based
panel
testing
for
BRCA1/BRCA2/
RAD51C/RAD51D/BRIP1/PALB2
mutations
is
highly
cost-
effective: ICER ¼ £7629.65/QALY or $49 282.19/QALY (0.04 days’
life-expectancy gained). A population-based panel testing strat-
egy for BRCA1/BRCA2/RAD51C/RAD51D/BRIP1/PALB2 mutations
is the most cost-effective strategy compared with current pol-
icy: ICER ¼ £21 599.96/QALY (9.34 days’ life-expectancy gained)
or $54 769.78/QALY (7.57 days’ life-expectancy gained).
Results
of
the
one-way
sensitivity
analysis
(Figure
2;
Supplementary Figures 2 and 3, available online) indicate that
for Strategies A and B, model outcomes are not impacted that
much by different model parameters (Supplementary Tables 2
and 3, available online), mutation prevalence, surgical preven-
tion costs, utility scores, or treatment of OC/BC or cardiovascu-
lar disease. Despite varying parameters at extremes of their
confidence intervals/ranges, the model remains cost-effective
at the less than £30 000/QALY or $100 000/QALY thresholds. The
model is cost-effective at the lower limits of RRSO (30%) and
RRM (34%).
PSA results (Figures 3 and 4) show that at £30 000/QALY,
WTP threshold population testing for all gene mutations
(Strategy B) is the preferred strategy in 83.7% of simulations and
that clinical criteria/FH-based panel testing for all gene muta-
tions (Strategy A) is preferred only in 16.2% of simulations.
Correspondingly, in American women, strategy B is the pre-
ferred strategy, at $100 000/QALY WTP threshold, in 92.7% of
simulations. A population testing strategy is more cost-effective
than any clinical criteria/FH testing strategy, with Strategy B
emerging as the most cost-effective. Taken together, this clearly
indicates the cost-effectiveness and overall preference for a
population testing approach for BRCA1/BRCA2/RAD51C/RAD51D/
BRIP1/PALB2 mutations in the general population.
Scenario analyses are presented in Table 3. The alternative
Strategies A and B still remain cost-effective at the UK/US WTP
thresholds compared with the current clinical strategy, even if
there is no reduction in BC risk from RRSO (ICER ¼ £27 632.95/
QALY or $72 221.37/QALY) and for lower RRM and RRSO rates.
Population testing remains cost-effective until the genetic
testing costs rise to £250/test or $772/test.
BRCA1/BRCA2/RAD51C/RAD51D/BRIP1/PALB2 testing can pre-
vent 1.86%/1.91% of BC and 3.2%/4.88% of OC in UK/US women:
657/655 OC cases and 2420/2386 BC cases prevented per million.
The overall proportion and number of BC/OC cases prevented as
well as excess cardiovascular deaths from general (non-Jewish)
population-based
BRCA1/BRCA2/RAD51C/RAD51D/BRIP1/PALB2

 Discussion
Our analysis for the first time addresses the important topical
issue of cost-effectiveness of a population-based strategy for
testing moderate/high-penetrance OC/BC gene mutations in the
general population. It justifies cost differences for different
interventions by providing QALY-based health outcomes. This
is required to guide policy decisions on health care resource
allocation
for
disease
prevention.
Our
findings
that
a
population-based genetic testing strategy for OC/BC gene muta-
tions outperforms any clinical criteria or FH strategy, with 84%
to 93% of simulations being cost-effective on PSA (£30 000/QALY
and $100 000/QALY thresholds), are extremely noteworthy. Such
a population-based program implemented in women older than
age 30 years could result in 17 505/65 221 fewer OC and 64 493/
237 610 fewer BC cases in British/American women, respec-
tively. This can have a much greater impact on the burden of
disease than any current treatment strategy. Our data also high-
light the need to move from BRCA1/BRCA2 testing to panel
testing, incorporating additional RAD51C/RAD51D/BRIP1/PALB2
mutations within a clinical criteria/FH-based strategy itself.
These results have important implications for clinical care
and OC/BC prevention. They could also be valuable to program
evaluators/managers,
policy
makers,
and
health
care
commissioners.
Long and Ganz (43) used our AJ decision analysis model (22)
to evaluate systematic BRCA1/BRCA2 testing in the general non-
Jewish population and found it not to be cost-effective (43).
However, AJ estimates/parameters should not be used to evalu-
ate general population testing, which may be a reason that their
analysis gives apparently incorrect/different results. For exam-
ple, they use AJ estimates for prevalence of FH of cancer.
However, clinical/FH criteria are far more stringent and preva-
lence of such individuals is much lower in the general com-
pared with the AJ population. These data were previously
unpublished and obtained from the ABCFR control population
for our analysis. Additionally, our current model and analysis
are different and more comprehensive, use general non-AJ esti-
mates, and compare two new panel testing strategies with the
current gold standard of clinical criteria/FH-based BRCA1/BRCA2
testing.
Our analysis has several advantages. It fulfills various princi-
ples listed by NICE for economic analyses including preferred
type of economic evaluation (28). We use the NICE guideline

ness-to-pay threshold scale, the sum of proportion of cost-effective simulations for all three strategies is always 1. At the £30 000/quality-adjusted life-year will-
ingness-to-pay threshold, 16.2% simulations are cost-effective for clinical criteria/family history–based testing for all gene mutations (curve A) and 83.7%
simulations are cost-effective for population testing for all gene mutations (curve B). A population testing strategy is more cost-effective than any clinical crite-
ria/FH testing strategy.

 and clinical criteria–based current BRCA1/BRCA2 testing policy
as the best practice comparator. Additionally, QALYs are used
to measure health effects, utilities are incorporated, and costs
and outcomes discounted at 3.5%. Model parameters are de-
rived from well-established/proven information from the litera-
ture and up-to-date data from the PROMISE program, GCaPPS
study, and Australian BC registry. The time horizon is sufficient
to reveal important differences in costs and outcomes, and
costs of pretest counseling plus testing are included. Apart from
OC/BC outcomes, we also included excess coronary deaths from
premenopausal oophorectomy (26). To avoid overestimating the
advantages of population testing, we used conservative costs
for OC/BC diagnosis, treatment, and management of recurrence
(44). The extensive sensitivity analysis presented adds rigor to
the results. Costs of counseling, RRSO, chemoprevention, and
treatment of OC/BC/coronary disease do not influence the over-
all results. The results remain cost-effective even at extremes of
BRCA1/BRCA2 prevalence/penetrance estimates. Our analysis
also highlights the need for better precision around the preva-
lence
and
penetrance
estimates
of
RAD51C/RAD51D/BRIP1/
PALB2 mutations as the confidence intervals for these are ex-
tremely wide. This requires further research.
A limitation may be considering only cardiovascular mortal-
ity (not morbidity) from early oophorectomy. However, we in-
clude costs for all excess cardiovascular disease, and one-way
sensitivity analysis shows that these parameters don’t substan-
tially impact results. Another limitation may be our exclusion of
increased lung/colorectal cancer mortality from premenopausal
oophorectomy
reported
in
the
Nurses
Health
Study
(26).
However, this finding was not validated/reproduced in the
337 802 women EPIC study (45). Additionally, this excess mortal-
ity is confounded by smoking/risk-related behaviors. The NIH-
AARP
Diet
and
Health
Study
found
that
oophorectomy-
associated increased lung cancer risk was limited to smokers
(46). Additionally, cardiovascular risk can also be confounded by
smoking. Besides, the cohort data show that RRSO is associated
with an overall 77% reduction in all-cause mortality (47), which
will further improve cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, even if we
assumed a higher all-cause mortality (1:8), the model remains
cost-effective for population screening (ICER ¼ £22 820/QALY and
$58 561/QALY, 8.7 and 6.9 days’ life-expectancy gained).
We assume a 71% uptake of genetic testing. However, the true
uptake in non-AJ women needs to be addressed in future studies.
Acceptability/uptake of population-based panel testing is being
assessed by us in the PROMISE pilot study (48). Premature surgical
menopause is associated with worse sexual functioning and vaso-
motor symptoms without decreasing generic quality of life (49–
52). While HRT ameliorates detrimental consequences of prema-
ture menopause, symptom levels are still higher in those retaining
their ovaries (51). This can be offset by reduced cancer worry, de-
crease in perceived risk, and high satisfaction rates found with
surgical prevention (49,50). These issues, along with a small (�3%–
4%) complication rate (53), should be part of informed consent and
the RRSO decision-making process. While we assume 80% HRT
compliance, the true compliance in a larger population-based co-
hort remains to be determined. It is important for these women to
have long-term follow-up and monitoring of bone/cardiovascular
health and receive psychosexual support.
The utility of concomitant hysterectomy along with RRSO
has been debated. Proponents of hysterectomy cite the benefits
of estrogen-alone HRT (no increased BC/heart disease risk) (54)
and avoiding cervical smears. The impact and context of HRT in
women
undergoing
premenopausal
oophorectomy
is
completely
different
than
that
of
older
postmenopausal
Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) women. Short-term HRT in
BRCA1/BRCA2 carriers undergoing premenopausal oophorec-
tomy doesn’t increase BC risk (55). HRT is protective for heart
disease in premenopausal oophorectomized women (26,27), will
be stopped at age 50 years (age of menopause), and does not in-
crease
cardiovascular
risk
in
the
postmenopausal
post-
intervention phase (54). Hysterectomy has higher morbidity,
complication rates, and costs, longer operating time, and longer
hospital stay/recovery. Hysterectomy is not routinely offered as
an alternative to progesterone HRT or to tamoxifen in BC. With
tamoxifen, the absolute increase in endometrial cancer (EC) risk
is small (56), and The American Congress of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists
(ACOG)/Royal
College
of
Obstetricians
and
Gynaecologists (RCOG) guidelines only recommend urgent in-
vestigation of unscheduled/abnormal bleeding (57,58). Recent
reports suggest increased serous EC risk in BRCA1 (59,60).
However, serous EC comprises approximately 7% of overall EC
(61), the number of cases was low, confidence intervals were
wide, absolute EC risk (�3%) remained small, and overall EC risk
was not statistically significantly increased (59,60). A recent
cost-effectiveness analysis had limitations. It only included
women undergoing mastectomy and lacked a disutility for hys-
terectomy (62). Further corroborating data are needed, and the is-
sue of hysterectomy may then need revisiting. The risk-benefit
profile doesn’t currently justify routine hysterectomy at RRSO for
OC risk reduction (63), and most centers don’t practice this.
In line with a number of analyses in high-risk (2,64,65) and
low-risk (66) women, our base model incorporates a reduction
in BC risk with premenopausal oophorectomy. Conversely, a re-
cent Dutch article (67) found no such effect. However, the

 follow-up was short (3.2 years) (67), and longer follow-up data
are awaited. Nevertheless, our scenario analysis reconfirms the
cost-effectiveness
of
Strategy
A
and
Strategy
B
even
if
premenopausal
oophorectomy
doesn’t
decrease
BC
risk.
RAD51C/RAD51D/PALB2 have been considered single cancer
genes only. However, should future evidence show both in-
creased OC and BC, it would increase the cost-effectiveness of
population testing.
Our model incorporates the impact of breast screening al-
ready prevalent and RRM. While RRM is weighted for a 21%
complication rate, any reduction in QALYs is not included.
Although RRM is linked with a negative impact on body image
and sexual pleasure, no detrimental impact on sexual activity,
habit, discomfort (68), anxiety, depression, or quality of life was
reported (68–70). Besides, adverse consequences may be bal-
anced by decreased anxiety, increased social activity (68), and
high cosmetic satisfaction rates (69,71–73).
Genomic, clinical, and biological information is being com-
bined through precision medicine initiatives like the 100 000
Genomes (74) and Moonshot (75) projects to optimize clinical
decisions for personalized treatment. Importantly, these advan-
ces also offer the opportunity for personalized cancer preven-
tion. This can have a much bigger impact on reducing the
burden of disease but requires a shift in focus to the unaffected
population. We show for the first time that the introduction of
systematic genetic testing in the general population for BRCA1/
BRCA2/RAD51C/RAD51D/BRIP1/PALB2
mutations
is
a
cost-
effective strategy that can reduce OC and BC incidence and save
lives. This form of panel testing can potentially be expanded to
include other gene mutations with established clinical utility
for cancer prevention. Our findings pave the way for research
studies in carriers ascertained through population means to
evaluate and understand impact on psychological health, qual-
ity of life, and long-term health behavior and reconfirm uptake
rates of screening/surgical prevention strategies. Additionally,
big service redesign and implementation issues affecting major
system change/intervention outcomes (76,77) need addressing
before introducing such a program. Furthermore, a robust sys-
tem/platform for monitoring and reclassifying (as required) var-
iants of uncertain significance detected needs establishing.
Other issues that need addressing include raising public/health
professional awareness, education, delivery logistics, quality
control, call-recall mechanisms, and fail-safe checks/processes
for quality assurance. All these have additional costs. Further
development/expansion
of
coordinated/integrated
clinical
pathways between primary and tertiary care involving general
practitioners, geneticists, gynecologists, and breast teams are
needed for managing high-risk women. Given the extreme cost-
effectiveness (78) of AJ population BRCA testing, panel testing
incorporating additional OC/BC genes would be cost-effective
too and should be considered. The global cancer burden is
expected to rise by 75% (79), and the number of BC/OC cases by
24%/27% in the United Kingdom and 34%/39% in the United
States, respectively, by 2035 (80). Cancer prevention is the key to
achieving
long-term
transformational
change
and
cost-
efficiencies in our health system. It is important that we seize
the opportunity to facilitate implementation of genomics for
cancer prevention in health care.
