Background: Tafenoquine is a new prophylactic antimalarial drug. The current analysis presents an in-
tegrated safety assessment of the Tafenoquine Anticipated Clinical Regimen (Tafenoquine ACR) from 5
clinical trials, including 1 conducted in deployed military personnel and 4 in non-deployed residents,
which also incorporated placebo and mefloquine comparator groups.
Methods: Adverse events (AEs) were coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities
(MedDRA®, Version 15.0) and summarized. Among all subjects who had received the Tafenoquine ACR,
safety findings were compared for subjects who were deployed military personnel from the Australian
Defence Force (Deployed ADF) versus non-deployed residents (Resident Non-ADF).
Results: The incidence of at least one AE was 80.6%, 64.1%, 67.6% and 94.9% in the mefloquine, placebo,
tafenoquine Resident Non-ADF and tafenoquine Deployed ADF groups, respectively. The latter group had
a higher incidence of AEs related to military deployment. AEs that occurred at � 1% incidence in both
tafenoquine sub-groups and at a higher frequency than placebo included diarrhea, nausea, vomiting,
gastroenteritis, nasopharyngeal tract infections, and back/neck pain.
Conclusions: Weekly administration of tafenoquine for up to six months increased the incidence of
gastrointestinal AEs, certain infections, and back/neck pain, but not the overall incidence of AEs versus
placebo.

1. Introduction
Malaria, a protozoan infection that targets human erythrocytes,
is a potentially fatal illness that is transmitted by Plasmodium-
infected mosquitoes. In the US, the overall trend of malaria cases
has been increasing, with 84% of patients requiring hospitalization
[1]. In spite of the considerable risks associated with malaria, over
90% of US patients who developed malaria in 2013 had not adhered
to a medically-advised chemoprophylaxis drug regimen [1].
Historically,
mefloquine
was
once
a
favored
prophylactic
antimalarial, due to its efficacy and convenient weekly dosing
schedule [2]. However, mefloquine's association with adverse
neuropsychiatric effects has prompted safety concerns [3] and has
curtailed mefloquine's use by the US military [4]. As alternatives to
mefloquine, doxycycline, atovaquone/proguanil, and primaquine
all require daily dosing, which can decrease compliance, and all are
associated with bothersome gastrointestinal side effects, among
other safety problems [5e8]. Hence, due to the dosing inconve-
nience and safety drawbacks of existing prophylactic antimalarials,
a safe and effective alternative drug has been sought.
Tafenoquine is a primaquine analog being developed for malaria
prophylaxis in adults. Like primaquine, tafenoquine is an 8-
aminoquinoline; however, its half-life of ~2 weeks is considerably
longer, allowing for weekly dosing [8]. Tafenoquine is active against
Plasmodium parasites in vitro and has been tested successfully

Please cite this article in press as: Novitt-Moreno A, et al., Tafenoquine for malaria prophylaxis in adults: An integrated safety analysis, Travel
Medicine and Infectious Disease (2017), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2017.05.008
 against malaria in animal models [9]. In man, the anticipated
clinical regimen (ACR) of tafenoquine for malaria prophylaxis is
200 mg orally (PO) daily for 3 consecutive days (the loading dose),
followed by 200 mg PO once weekly. This regimen has proven
effective for malaria prophylaxis in both non-immune [10] and
semi-immune subjects [2].
For the Tafenoquine ACR, safety data comes from 5 clinical trials
(Table 1), all previously published. These include: Study 033, a
randomized, double-blind, active-controlled trial of tafenoquine vs.
mefloquine in non-immune Australian Defence Force (ADF) sol-
diers deployed to East Timor (now Timor Leste) [11]; Studies 030,
043, and 45, all randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials
of tafenoquine in residents of malaria endemic regions of Africa
[2,12,13]; and Study 057, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled safety study of tafenoquine in healthy adult residents of
the United States (US) or the United Kingdom (UK) [14]. Because
tafenoquine like primaquine [15] can cause hemolysis in in-
dividuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) defi-
ciency, these clinical trials have excluded G6PD-deficient subjects,
as well as pregnant women. Of the 5 trials, only Study 033 lacked a
placebo control group for ethical and operational reasons [10].
A goal of the present analysis was to present an integrated safety
and tolerability assessment of the Tafenoquine ACR across the 5
studies in which it was utilized (Table 1). To assure a uniform
approach to adverse event (AE) coding, this analysis employed a
unified, updated, and consistent coding system for AEs. In addition,
targeted analyses were performed to allow for safety comparisons
between subgroups that were potentially impacted by disparate
extrinsic factors, especially military deployment under warlike
conditions.
2. Methods
2.1. Ethical approval and subject consent
Descriptions of the ethical approval process and subject consent
procedures for each study are provided in the individual study
publications. Briefly, study protocol and consent forms were
reviewed and approved by one or more of the following scientific
and ethical review boards: the Scientific Steering and Ethical Re-
view Committee of the Kenya Medical Research Institute (Studies
030 and 043); the Ghanaian Ministry of Health (Study 045); the
Australian Defence Medical Ethics Committee (Study 033); and the
institutional review boards of the Walter Reed Army Institute for
Research (Study 043) and the US Army (all studies). In trials con-
ducted in Africa, local approval of the study was granted by tradi-
tional chiefs and community leaders. Tribal language consent forms
were read by or to every prospective subject, and informed affir-
mation or informed consent was obtained from those residents
wishing to participate. In studies 033 and 057, subjects provided
informed consent based on study information provided in English.
2.2. Conduct of the studies
Detailed descriptions of the screening, randomization, drug
administration, and clinical assessments employed in the 5 studies
have been provided previously [2,11e14]. All 5 studies included
healthy adults who were not G6PD deficient as determined by pre-
study testing. All females were non-pregnant and non-lactating.
Good health was verified by medical history, physical examina-
tion, and clinical laboratory testing [complete blood count (CBC),
serum biochemistry, dipstick urinalysis]. For African studies where
antimalarial pre-treatments were administered (Studies 030, 043,
and 045), Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood smears were per-
formed to confirm parasite clearance prior to initiating study
medications. All study drugs were administered with a meal. Safety
assessments included reports of AEs; abnormalities in CBC,
methemoglobin levels, and serum biochemistry; and urinalysis.
Also, based on sporadic reports of mild elevations of serum creat-
inine in Study 033, changes in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by
iothalamate clearance were assessed in all subjects in Study 057
[14]. In addition, targeted ophthalmologic assessments were

 performed in a subpopulation of Study 033 [11] and in all subjects
of Study 057 [14].
2.3. Conduct of the integrated safety analysis
For each study, safety data were double-entered and verified,
and data files were locked before analysis. Safety analyses were
conducted using the Safety Analysis Set of each study, defined as all
patients who had been randomized and received at least one dose
of study drug. Baseline was defined as the last non-missing
assessment made on or prior to the first dose of study drug,
while Study Day 1 was defined as the first day on which study drug
was taken. AEs were coded according to the Medical Dictionary for
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®, Version 15.0) and summarized by
preferred term and body system. In studies where AEs had been
originally coded according to the World Health Organization
(WHO) Adverse Reaction Terminology (ART) dictionary, the AEs
were re-coded according to the MedDRA terminology. AEs due to
pregnancy were not included in the AE summaries, but were listed
separately. AE relationship to study drug was defined conserva-
tively – an AE was considered “related” to the study drug if it was
assessed as unlikely, possibly, probably, or definitely related to the
drug. Only AEs assessed as unrelated to the study drug comprised
the “not related” category.
3. Results
3.1. Demographics
Subject demographics for the 5 Tafenoquine ACR studies are
presented in Supplementary Table 1. Across the 5 studies, a total of
825 subjects received the Tafenoquine ACR (labeled the “Tafeno-
quine ACR Overall” group), while 309 received Mefloquine, and 295
received Placebo. Among the Tafenoquine ACR Overall group, the
majority of subjects were members of the Deployed ADF subgroup
(n ¼ 492). These subjects were ADF personnel in Study 033 who
were involved in peacekeeping activities in Timor Leste, including
night patrols and militia encounters [10]. The second subgroup of
the Tafenoquine ACR population was termed the “Resident Non-
ADF” subgroup (n ¼ 333), as these subjects were either residents of
African villages (Studies 030, 043, and 045) or of municipalities in
the USA or UK (Study 057) and were not involved in the types of
military activities to which the Deployed ADF subgroup was
exposed.
Among all 5 studies, subjects ranged in age from 17 to 69 years,
with the majority being male (62.8e97.2%). The Tafenoquine ACR
Overall group (n ¼ 825) and Mefloquine comparator group
(n ¼ 309) were well matched with respect to age and sex. However,
the Tafenoquine ACR Overall group included a higher percentage of
Whites than the Mefloquine group (63.8% vs. 51.8%, respectively)
and fewer African/Black subjects (33.7% vs. 47.6%). The Placebo
group included a greater percentage of African/Black subjects
(90.1%) than either the Tafenoquine ACR Overall or Mefloquine
groups due to the African locations of Studies 030, 043, and 045.
With respect to the two Tafenoquine ACR subgroups, Deployed
ADF versus Resident Non-ADF, the deployed subgroup was younger
(mean age 25.4 years versus 35.4 years, respectively) and was
comprised of a larger percentage of males (97.2% vs. 64.3%)
reflective of the infantry battalion that took part in the study. In
addition, the Deployed ADF group was almost exclusively of
Caucasian race (98.4%), while the Resident Non-ADF population
was largely African/Black (83.5%), reflecting the demographics of
the African studies.
3.2. Extent of exposure
Extent of exposure to study drug (Supplementary Table 1) was
longer in the Tafenoquine ACR Overall group (mean 21.2 weeks)
than in either the Mefloquine group (18.9 weeks) or in the Placebo
group (9.3 weeks). The abbreviated exposure time in the Placebo
group reflected early withdrawals due to lack of efficacy (i.e., ma-
laria) in the 3 African studies. Within the 2 subgroups of the Tafe-
noquine ACR Overall population, Deployed ADF troops received
tafenoquine for a mean of 27 weeks, which was longer than the
Resident Non-ADF group (mean 12.7 weeks). These different time
periods reflected pre-planned trial duration rather than lack of
efficacy.
3.3. Treatment discontinuations
No deaths occurred among subjects who received the Tafeno-
quine ACR. The number of treatment discontinuations due to AEs
(Table 2) by-study were as follows: for Study 030, one (1.0%) of 104
subjects; for Study 033, twelve (2.4%) of 492 subjects; for Study
043, one (1.8%) of 55 subjects; for Study 045, ten (10.8%) of 93
subjects; and for Study 057, six (7.4%) of 81 subjects. The high
withdrawal rate in Study 045 was driven by the study's nontradi-
tional withdrawal criteria [12], which removed a subject from study
participation if the subject's laboratory values drifted outside of
those listed in the study's entry criteria. Consequently, even minor,
non-serious, alterations in ALT (including some ALT values below
60 U/L) were grounds for withdrawal. Similarly, all 3 withdrawals
due to decreased hemoglobin (decreases of 1.6e2.2 g/dL) in Study
045 were considered non-serious, and all resolved without treat-
ment. With the exception of withdrawals due to generally mild
laboratory abnormalities in Study 045, discontinuations in the 3
African studies (Studies 030, 043, and 045) were rare, involving
only 1 subject per study (1.0%e1.8% of the study population).
Discontinuations for ophthalmic or renal AEs in the Tafenoquine
ACR group of Study 057 reflected the fact that this trial was a tar-
geted
safety
study,
wherein
specific
variations
in
renal
or
ophthalmologic parameters would lead to protocol-directed with-
drawals. Subjects discontinued due to changes in iothalamate
clearance GFR showed no concurrent clinically significant changes
in serum creatinine or urinalysis findings. Their mild GFR changes
were attributed to variations in the GFR measuring techniques and
were considered unlikely to be related to study drug. The co-
occurrence of 3 ophthalmologic AEs (decreased visual acuity,
night blindness, and visual field defect) in one subject in Study 057
led to that subject's discontinuation. Reports of these AEs were
based on mild changes in the results of specialized eye tests at one
study visit. On repeat evaluation, the subject's visual parameters
were found to be normal.
In Study 033, multiple discontinuations occurred in the Tafe-
noquine ACR group due to injuries (5 subjects) or musculoskeletal
pain (2 subjects), all of which were the result of military deploy-
ment and unrelated to tafenoquine. A single ADF subject was dis-
continued due to depression and a second due to hyperesthesia.
3.4. Analyses of adverse events
Analyses were performed to search for any effects related to
protocol-based antimalarial pretreatments in the African studies.
The findings indicated that these antimalarials had no impact on
safety.
Table 3 presents an overview of safety findings in the 5 studies,
including findings for the 2 sub-groups of the Tafenoquine ACR
Overall population (Deployed ADF and Resident Non-ADF). In all
studies, the majority of AEs were mild and considered “not related”

 to the study drugs. Placebo subjects and Resident Non-ADF subjects
who received tafenoquine were similar in their overall incidence of
AEs (64.1% vs. 67.6%, respectively) and AE relationship to study
drug. Percentages of AEs that were considered “not related” to the
study drug were higher in the Tafenoquine ACR Overall group
(73.9%) and in the Mefloquine comparator group (77.1%) than in the
Placebo group (55.6%). In the Tafenoquine ACR Overall group, the
percentages of subjects with serious adverse events (SAEs) and
subjects with treatment-related SAEs (5.7% and 2.7%, respectively)
were higher than in either the Placebo group (3.4% and 1.0%,
respectively) or in the Mefloquine comparator group (3.6% and
1.3%, respectively). Specific treatment-related SAEs that occurred in
more than 1 subject within the Tafenoquine ACR Overall population
were keratopathy (corneal deposits) (5 subjects or 0.6% of the

 population), decreased GFR (5 subjects or 0.6%), and retinal disor-
der (2 subjects or 0.2%) (data not shown). Additional treatment-
related SAEs that each affected only 1 subject in the Tafenoquine
Overall group were pneumonia, gastroenteritis, helminthic infec-
tion, urinary tract infection, diarrhea, abdominal pain, abdominal
pain upper, irritable bowel syndrome, headache, visual field defect,
and haemolytic anemia. In comparison, treatment-related SAEs in
the Mefloquine comparator group were retinal disorder, pneu-
monia, anxiety, and rash. Each of these was reported in one subject
(0.3%) in the Mefloquine group. The keratopathy reports were in the
first cohort in which this finding was detected (a new significant
finding) and were not reported as SAEs after these initial reports.
The keratopathy was not associated with any deficit in visual acuity
and was fully resolved in all subjects by 1 year [11].
In the Tafenoquine ACR Overall population (Table 3), the per-
centage of subjects with AEs was markedly higher in the Deployed
ADF subgroup (94.9%) than in the Resident Non-ADF subgroup
(67.6%). In addition, a much higher percentage of AEs in the
Deployed ADF subjects was considered to be “not related” to
treatment (86.7%) than in the Resident Non-ADF group (53.0%). This
suggested that the Deployed ADF subgroup had been exposed to
extrinsic factors that influenced the safety findings of Study 033. To
examine this issue, AEs were categorized for the Tafenoquine ACR
Overall population and its two subgroups versus Placebo (Table 4).
Compared to Resident Non-ADF subjects, Deployed ADF subjects
had higher incidences of ear and labyrinth disorders (6.7% vs. 1.8%),
eye disorders (17.1% vs. 10.2%), gastrointestinal disorders (36.2% vs.
30.9%), immune system disorders (4.9% vs. 0.3%), infections and

complications (39.8% vs. 10.5%), musculoskeletal and connective
tissue disorders (28.7% vs. 26.7%), psychiatric disorders (5.1% vs.
2.1%) and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (21.1% vs. 11.4%).
Conversely, Resident Non-ADF subjects had higher incidences of
blood and lymphatic system disorders (9.3% vs. 0.4%), general dis-
orders
and
administration

conditions
(12.0%
vs.
3.7%),
hepatobiliary disorders (1.5% vs. 0), investigations AEs (8.4% vs.
1.2%), metabolism and nutrition disorders (4.2% vs. 2.2%), nervous
system disorders (35.1% vs. 22.4%), and reproductive system and
breast disorders (3.9% vs. 1.6%).
Notably, for many of the AE categories in Table 4, the profile of
the Resident Non-ADF group was similar to that of Placebo. This
included ear and labyrinth disorders (Resident Non-ADF 1.8% vs.
Placebo 1.7%), eye disorders (10.2% vs. 10.5%), gastrointestinal dis-
orders (30.9% vs. 32.5%), infections and infestations (42.9% vs.
46.4%), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (26.7% vs.
26.4%), nervous system disorders (35.1% vs. 34.2%), reproductive
system and breast disorders (3.9% vs. 3.7%), and skin and subcu-
taneous tissue disorders (11.4% vs. 12.5%).
To further explore the safety profile of Deployed ADF subjects
versus the Resident Non-ADF group, AEs that occurred at �1%
incidence were compared for these populations (Supplementary
Table 2). AEs that were reported in �1% of the Deployed ADF sub-
group but in �1% of the Resident Non-ADF subgroup were kerat-
opathy (13.8% in the Deployed ADF subgroup vs. 0% in the Resident
Non-ADF subgroup; see explanation above for this new safety
finding in Study 033), GERD (2.6% vs. 0.3%), seasonal allergy (3.9%
vs. 0.3%), impetigo (1.6% vs. 0%), otitis externa (1.8% vs. 0.6%), tinea
infection (1.4% vs. 0.6%), tinea pedis (4.9% vs. 0%), arthropod bite
(2.4% vs. 0.6%), heat illness (2.2% vs. 0%), joint injury (3.7% vs. 0.9%),
muscle strain (2.8% vs. 0.9%), soft tissue injury (12.2% vs. 0.6%),
thermal burn (1.8% vs. 0.3%), lethargy (4.7% vs. 0.3%), insomnia (1.6%
vs. 0.6%), heat rash (10.8% vs. 0%), and ingrowing nail (2.4% vs. 0%).
Other AEs for which there was an incidence disparity of 10% or
more between the Deployed ADF subgroup and the Resident Non-
ADF subgroup included diarrhea (18.1% vs. 4.8%), gastroenteritis
(37.2% vs. 7.8%), and nasopharyngitis (19.7% vs. 3.3%). Overall, these
disparities in AE incidences were consistent with the fact that the
Deployed AE subjects were de facto travelers in a foreign land, with
an increased risk for gastroenteritis and diarrhea, as well as for
other maladies related to deployment during a military operation

 (heat illness, heat rash, allergies, impetigo, otitis externa, arthropod
bites, and tinea infections). Also, the ADF subjects were exposed to
hostile conditions that often occurred during night patrols [10],
increasing their risk for combat-related injuries (joint injury,
muscle strain, soft tissue injury, and burns), insomnia, and (post-
patrol) lethargy.
AEs that were reported in �1% of the Resident Non-ADF sub-
group but in �1% of the Deployed ADF subgroup (Supplementary
Table 2) were anaemia (incidence 3.0% vs. 0%, respectively),
leukocytosis
(2.4%
vs.
0%),
thrombocytopenia
(3.0%
vs.

abdominal pain upper (3.6% vs. 0.8%), constipation (5.1% vs. 0.6%),

(3.0% vs. 0.4%), cellulitis (1.8% vs. 1.0%), pharyngitis (1.2% vs. 0.8%),
rhinitis (4.8% vs. 0.2%), urinary tract infection (3.0% vs. 0.4%), wound
sepsis (2.4% vs. 0%), ALT increased (3.6% vs. 0%), decreased appetite
(3.6% vs. 0.6%), myalgia (7.8% 0.2%), dysmenorrhoea (2.4% vs. 0.4%),
nasal congestion (3.3% vs. 0.4%), cough (13.5% vs. 1.0%, and pruritis
(5.1% vs. 0.4%). Other AEs for which there was an incidence disparity
of �10% between the Resident Non-ADF subjects and the Deployed
ADF subjects were URI (20.1% vs. 9.1%) and headache (31.8% vs.
14.6%). These disparities in AE incidences were consistent with the
more mundane home-centered lifestyle of the Resident Non-ADF
subgroup, with its associated risk of typical nasopharyngeal in-
fections, coughs, constipation, and headaches. In some cases, (pri-
marily in African studies) there was also a risk for endemic
concurrent infections (e.g., amoebiasis and helminthic infections)
and for suboptimal nutrition.
3.5. Common adverse events independent of extrinsic factors
AEs that occurred at an incidence �1% in both the Deployed ADF
and Resident Non-ADF subgroups and also at a higher incidence
than in the Placebo group (Table 5) were diarrhea, nausea, vomit-
ing, body tinea, gastroenteritis, nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, tonsil-
litis, laceration, ligament sprain, back pain, neck pain, and rash.
Among these, only gastroenteritis and back pain occurred in more
than 5% of subjects in both subgroups.
Regarding AEs that are known to occur with mefloquine [16],
comparative incidences for the Mefloquine Group versus the
Tafenoquine ACR Overall group were as follows: dizziness (5.5% vs.
2.7%), myalgia (4.5% vs. 3.3%), nausea (5.8% vs. 6.1%), headache
(29.8% vs. 21.6%), vomiting (3.6% vs. 3.8%), diarrhea (10.7% vs.
12.7%), skin rash (2.3% vs. 3.0%), abdominal pain (11.3% vs. 5.9%),
loss of appetite (1.9% vs.1.8%) (data not shown). Overall, the Tafe-
noquine ACR was associated with lower risk for dizziness, myalgia,
headache, and abdominal pain than mefloquine.
3.6. Psychiatric adverse events
To explore the potential impact of a hostile environment on
psychiatric AEs among military personnel in the Deployed ADF
group, the percentages of subjects with specific low-incidence
(�1%) psychiatric AEs were compared (Table 6) between the Tafe-
noquine ACR Overall group, the Deployed ADF subgroup, and the
Resident Non-ADF subgroup. Among the 25 Deployed ADF subjects
who experienced psychiatric disorders, the majority [18 (72%) of
25] developed problems related to sleep (insomnia, abnormal
dreams, nightmares, sleep disorder). In comparison, among Resi-
dent Non-ADF subjects, sleep AEs affected 3 (42.9%) of 7 subjects.
Types of psychiatric AEs (Table 6) that occurred in a greater
percentage of Deployed ADF subjects than in Resident Non-ADF
subjects were the following: insomnia, abnormal dreams, night-
mares, sleep disorder, agitation, anxiety disorder, euphoric mood,
panic attack, and stress. Overall, the Deployed ADF military subjects
of Study 033 experienced a higher incidence of psychiatric AEs and
a greater variety of psychiatric AEs than did non-deployed Resident
Non-ADF subjects. .
To potentially identify specific extrinsic factors in subjects who
reported psychiatric AEs in the Deployed ADF subgroup versus the
Resident Non-ADF subgroup, medical histories and non-psychiatric
AEs were reviewed for subjects who reported insomnia or sleep
disorder in these 2 subgroups (Table 7). Concurrent gastrointestinal
illnesses, active pain, or upper respiratory illnesses affected 8 out of
10 subjects with insomnia or sleep disorders in the Deployed ADF
subgroup and 2 of 3 subjects in the Resident Non-ADF subgroup.
When these confounding illnesses and events were eliminated,
comparable percentages (0.3%e0.4%) of the two subgroups expe-
rienced insomnia or sleep disorders. In terms of the Tafenoquine
ACR Overall population, although insomnia or sleep disorder was
reported in 1.6% of this population, only 3 of 825 subjects (0.4% of
the Tafenoquine ACR Overall population) did not have an identifi-
able concurrent illness or injury that might have contributed to
their inability to sleep (Table 7).
4. Discussion
To date, Tafenoquine has been tested in more than 25 clinical
trials, during which the drug was administered at different doses
and dosing regimens for various malaria-related clinical in-
dications. The goal of the present analysis was to provide an over-
view of the safety of tafenoquine when it is administered for
antimalarial prophylaxis utilizing an anticipated clinical regimen
(Tafenoquine ACR) of 200 mg PO daily loading dose for 3 consec-
utive days, followed by 200 mg once weekly. This regimen has been
administered in 5 clinical trials, in which some 825 subjects
received the Tafenoquine ACR, with 492 being deployed ADF mili-
tary personnel (the Deployed ADF dataset) and 333 being residents
of Africa, the US, or the UK (the Resident Non-ADF dataset). In Study
033 involving ADF personnel, Nasveld reported that the rates of
some common AEs were similar for tafenoquine and mefloquine
[11]. However, this study of necessity had no placebo group [10],
and, until now, the contribution of the deployment environment to
the AEs in Study 033 had not been assessed. The present analysis,
which includes placebo groups from 4 other Tafenoquine ACR
studies, helps put this issue into context.
As an analog of primaquine, tafenoquine might be expected to
share some characteristics of primaquine's AE profile, including
gastrointestinal side effects, dizziness, rash, pruritus, anemia,
methemoglobinemia, leukopenia, cardiac arrhythmia, prolongation
of the QT interval, and hemolytic anemia (in individuals with G6PD
deficiency) [15]. With respect to this list, some previous publica-
tions for trials that have utilized tafenoquine at higher exposures
than the Tafenoquine ACR have reported the adverse effects of
gastrointestinal
distress,
and
reversible
asymptomatic
meth-
aemoglobinemia, together with hemolytic anemia in rare in-
dividuals with G6PD deficiency who were admitted to the trials in
error [2]. The decision to utilize a 200 mg daily dose in the Tafe-
noquine ACR was informed not only by its satisfactory efficacy re-
sults for malaria prophylaxis, but also by safety findings indicating
fewer gastrointestinal problems, among other side effects, as
compared to higher daily doses [13,17]. In the present integrated
analysis of 5 trials, the tafenoquine dosing regimen utilized (Tafe-
noquine ACR) was safe and well tolerated. In the majority of trials,
only 1.0%e2.4% of subjects discontinued tafenoquine due to
adverse events. The exceptions were selected subjects in Studies
045
and
Study
057,
where
protocol-mandated
withdrawals
occurred due to what were typically mild, transient changes in
laboratory parameters or reversible eye test abnormalities.
In all studies, the majority of AEs were mild and considered

 unrelated to the study drugs. Among the Tafenoquine ACR Overall
population (Table 3), the Resident Non-ADF subgroup was similar
to Placebo subjects in overall incidence of AEs (67.6% vs. 64.1%,
respectively), AE relationship to study drug, and AE profile
(Table 4). These findings were consistent with those of previous
reports [12e14]. In contrast, the percentage of subjects with AEs

Medicine and Infectious Disease (2017), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2017.05.008
 was markedly higher in the Deployed ADF subgroup (94.9%) than in
the Resident Non-ADF subgroup (67.6%) (Table 3). In addition, a
much higher percentage of AEs in the Deployed ADF subjects were
considered to be unrelated to treatment (86.7%) than in the Resi-
dent Non-ADF group (53.0%). This suggested that the Deployed ADF
subgroup had been exposed to extrinsic factors, unrelated to drug
intake, which influenced their safety findings. It also demonstrated
that the ADF subjects were forthright in sharing their AE experi-
ences with medical personnel during Study 033 and did not
discriminate against any class of AE (i.e. neuropsychiatric events).
All members of the Deployed ADF subgroup participated in
Study 033 [10,11] in which the study population was comprised
entirely of ADF soldiers deployed on United Nations peacekeeping
duties in East Timor (October 2000eApril 2001). All were healthy
adults, ages 18e55, G6PD normal, with no history of psychiatric
disorders or seizures. This specific “peacekeeping” operation has in
fact been described as “warlike” [18], where the use of force was
authorized and where casualties were expected [19]. Consistent
with this violent milieu, traumatic exposures reported by ADF
personnel included the danger of being killed or injured (71% of
soldiers reporting); seeing dead bodies (49%); fear of exposure to a
toxic agent, contagious disease, or injury (31%); and having a friend/
associate killed or injured (30%) [18]. With these stressors as likely
contributing factors, 7.2% of ADF personnel deployed to East Timor
have reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
while 6.9% report long-term high levels of psychological stress [18].
Compounding these psychological threats were the physical
threats and trauma which the Deployed ADF subgroup experi-
enced, as evidenced by a high rate of injuries (39.8%) that was
roughly 4 times that of the Resident Non-ADF subgroup (10.5%)
(Table 4). Furthermore, compared to Resident Non-ADF subjects,
Deployed ADF subjects had a higher incidence of gastroenteritis,
diarrhea, and maladies related to military deployment (heat illness,
heat rash, allergies, impetigo, otitis externa, arthropod bites, and
tinea infections). Overall, these findings suggest that multiple
extrinsic factors to which the Deployed ADF subgroup was exposed
negatively impacted the perceived safety profile of tafenoquine in
that population. This finding is consistent with similar observations
made for studies conducted in military populations with prophy-
lactic mefloquine [20] or doxycycline [21].
Regarding psychiatric AEs, it has been recommended that in-
vestigators consider the physiological and psychological stressors
associated with military activities whenever they monitor a drug's
tolerability under military operational conditions [21]. For pro-
phylactic antimalarial drugs in particular, support for this recom-
mendation
comes
from
studies
showing
that
incidences
of
neuropsychiatric AEs (e.g., adjustment disorder, insomnia, anxiety
disorder) are higher in deployed vs. non-deployed military pop-
ulations, especially when deployment occurs under combat con-
ditions [21,22]. Under these circumstances, an increased level of
risk is evident even for FDA approved antimalarials that have no
known neuropsychiatric AE profile (e.g., doxycycline, atovaquone/
proguanil) [21,22]. Consistent with this increased risk, a review of
psychiatric data in the present analysis revealed that the Deployed
ADF subgroup reported a higher incidence of psychiatric AEs and a
greater variety of psychiatric AEs than did non-deployed Resident
Non-ADF subjects. This suggests that deployed military subjects
who received the Tafenoquine ACR during peacekeeping operations
were in fact exposed to deployment-related extrinsic factors,
including unique physical and psychological stressors, which
placed them at a higher risk for psychiatric AEs than their Resident
Non-ADF counterparts living at home.
Notably, among the 25 Deployed ADF subjects who reported
psychiatric disorders, the majority [18 (72%) of 25] developed
problems related to sleep (insomnia, abnormal dreams, night-
mares, sleep disorder). This underscores the potentially dramatic
effect that deployment can have on sleep in military populations
[23]. Sleep problems, particularly insomnia, are highly prevalent
during military deployments [24,25] and insomnia is often re-
ported not only during actual combat operations but also post-
deployment after combat ends [26e28]. In a recent exhaustive
study sponsored by the US Secretary of Defense, the RAND National
Defense Research Institute (US) concluded that sleep problem-
sdparticularly
insomnia,
short
sleep
duration,
and
night-
maresdare highly prevalent during combat operations [23]. These
findings are relevant to the present analysis, as they support the
conclusion that tafenoquine exposure was not the cause of an
increased burden of sleep-related AEs in the Deployed ADF
population.
Given differences in the incidences of some AEs in the Deployed
ADF subgroup compared to the Resident Non-ADF subgroup, what
represents an appropriate safety profile of AEs associated with the
Tafenoquine ACR for the population most likely to use malaria
prophylaxis (i.e., non-military travelers to endemic regions)?
Common AEs that were reported in 5% of both subgroups included
only gastroenteritis, upper respiratory tract infection (URI), back
pain, and headache, many of which likely occurred independent of
tafenoquine exposure, especially given the longer-term (12-month)
durations of Studies 033 and 057. This underscores the safety and
acceptable tolerance of the dosing regimen. Furthermore, in com-
parison to mefloquine, the Tafenoquine ACR (n ¼ 825) showed a
more benign safety profile, being associated with lower risks for
dizziness, myalgia, headache, and abdominal pain.
Limitations of the current analysis include the fact that the
majority of subjects in all trials were young adults, and that fewer
females than males were included. In addition, safety analyses were
not performed by race.
A further limitation relates to the inclusion of targeted eye as-
sessments for ophthalmological AEs (keratopathy and retinal
changes) in Studies 033 and 057, but not in the 3 studies that were
conducted earlier (African Studies 030, 043, or 045). Notably,
whenever ophthalmological AEs were identified in Studies 033 or
057, any observed changes to the cornea or retina were mild, fully
reversible, and had no impact on visual acuity. Although targeted

 ophthalmological assessments were not performed in the early
African studies, there was similarly no safety signal in these trials
indicating that vision was affected.
Following the completion of the Phase III study which ended in
2001, the development of tafenoquine was paused due to altered
commercial priorities and safety concerns. The latter involved the
ophthalmologic AEs referred to above together with the increased
serum creatinine observed in the Phase III study [11]. These issues
were subsequently resolved in healthy volunteers [14]. Overall, the
present analysis reaffirms that tafenoquine, when administered
according to the anticipated prophylactic clinical regimen, is a safe,
effective, and convenient prophylactic antimalarial drug in adults.
Although the drug's safety profile may be altered in some respects
when it is administered in deployed military populations, any dif-
ferences are more likely to reflect the rigors and hazards of military
deployment rather than side effects intrinsic to tafenoquine.
