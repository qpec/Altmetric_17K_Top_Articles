Validated measures are needed for assessing resilience in conflict settings. An Arabic version of the Child and
Youth Resilience Measure (CYRM) was developed and tested in Jordan. Following qualitative work, surveys
were implemented with male/female, refugee/nonrefugee samples (N = 603, 11–18 years). Confirmatory fac-
tor analyses tested three-factor structures for 28- and 12-item CYRMs and measurement equivalence across
groups.
CYRM-12
showed

and
face,

(comparative

index = .92–.98), and convergent validity. Gender-differentiated item loadings reflected resource access and
social responsibilities. Resilience scores were inversely associated with mental health symptoms, and for Syr-
ian refugees were unrelated to lifetime trauma exposure. In assessing individual, family, and community-level
dimensions of resilience, the CYRM is a useful measure for research and practice with refugee and host-com-
munity youth.
The numbers of people displaced by conflict are at
their highest levels ever, with over 65 million refu-
gees, asylum seekers, or internally displaced people
globally (UNHCR, 2015). Given an increased con-
cern for the mental health and psychosocial well-
being of conflict-affected, refugee, and displaced
child
and
adolescent
populations
(Reed,
Fazel,
Jones, Panter-Brick, & Stein, 2012), repeated calls
have been made to develop reliable and valid mea-
sures of resilience in late childhood and adolescence
(e.g., Windle, Bennett, & Noyes, 2011), a crucial
time in the transition to adulthood for social, bio-
logical, and cognitive development (Panter-Brick &
Leckman, 2013). In the context of risk, resilience is
variously conceptualized as better than expected
trajectories
of
healthy
functioning
over
time
(Bonanno, Westphal, & Mancini, 2011), the harness-
ing of resources to overcome adversity and sustain
well-being (Panter-Brick, 2014; Panter-Brick & Leck-
man, 2013; Southwick, Litz, Charney, & Friedman,
2011; Ungar, 2011), or the capacity of a dynamic
system to adapt successfully (Masten, 2014). Such
interdisciplinary definitions recognize that resilience
may be enhanced at the individual, family, and cul-
tural levels (Southwick, Bonanno, Masten, Panter-
Brick, & Yehuda, 2014). To study resilience is to
identify ways in which individuals and communi-
ties withstand adversity through individual and
collective
strengths,
resources,
and
capabilities.
Attention to these positive dimensions of human
well-being requires a widening of the scope of glo-
bal mental health research beyond a focus on

 psychopathology (Betancourt, Frounfelker, Mishra,
Hussein, & Falzarano, 2015; Betancourt et al., 2010;
Hobfoll, Stevens, & Zalta, 2015; Hobfoll et al., 2012;
Rutter, 2013). To date, the resilience literature sug-
gests that a useful measure of resilience will be one
that situates itself within a socioecological frame-
work (Betancourt, 2012; Masten, 2014; Tol, Song, &
Jordans, 2013), capturing variation rooted in indi-
vidual, relational, and contextual factors (Ungar,
2008, 2013).
The concept of resilience makes intuitive sense to
capture dimensions of agency, resourcefulness, and
social networks in response to adversity, but it is a
difficult concept to operationalize (Ager, Annan, &
Panter-Brick, 2013), even where branded as a key
principle
of humanitarian
intervention
to
assist
communities in crisis (e.g., United Nations Chil-
dren’s Emergency Fund, 2011). Most studies of resi-
lience and mental health use a proxy for resilience,
such as social support or a lack of psychopathol-
ogy,
instead
of
resilience-specific
instruments
(Siriwardhana, Ali, Roberts, & Stewart, 2014). In
cross-cultural work, resilience is often cast as the
polar opposite of vulnerability, and culture is con-
flated with society, religion, or ethnicity—this can
lead to reductionist analytical frameworks rather
than understanding what really matters in terms of
wellness, relationships, and shared understandings
about the world (Panter-Brick, 2015). It is clear that
reliable, valid, and culturally grounded measures of
child
and
adolescent
resilience
are
needed
for
appraising the prosocial functioning and psychoso-
cial well-being of conflict-affected youth; such mea-
sures would intersect and complement currently
available indicators of psychosocial distress and
mental health difficulties (Ager, 2013; Klasen et al.,
2010; Masten & Narayan, 2012). The development
and validation of an Arabic-language resilience
measure, serving the needs of local populations,
researchers, and policymakers, would address the
lack of reliable tools for working with vulnerable
groups of children and adolescents in non-Western
settings.
Existing Measures of Resilience
There are a few widely used measures of resili-
ence that could potentially be adapted for use with
Arabic-speaking youth, such as the Connor–David-
son Resilience Scale (CD-RISC; Connor & Davidson,
2003), the Resilience Scale (Wagnild & Young,
1993), the Brief Resilience Scale (Smith et al., 2008),
and
the
Child
and
Youth
Resilience
Measure
(CYRM; Ungar & Liebenberg, 2011). The CD-RISC,
the Resilience Scale, and the CYRM have all been
used with refugee populations (Klasen et al., 2010;
Ssenyonga, Owens, & Olema, 2013; Thabet & Tha-
bet, 2015; Wright et al., 2017), with CD-RISC and
CYRM applied to adolescent refugees specifically
(Abualkibash & Lera, 2015; Ghannam & Thabet,
2014; Nathan et al., 2013; Ziaian, de Anstiss, Anto-
niou, Baghurst, & Sawyer, 2012). However, most
measures
of
resilience—including
CD-RISC,
the
Resilience Scale, and the Brief Resilience Scale—
were originally developed with adults and/or are
solely
implemented
with
adults
(Windle
et al.,
2011). In their meta-analysis, conducted before the
final development of the CYRM, Windle et al.
(2011) found that there was “no current ‘gold stan-
dard’ amongst 15 measures of resilience” (p. 17)
available for use with children, adolescents, or
adults at the time, and emphasized that “a choice
of valid resilience measures for use with different
populations is urgently needed” (p. 17).
In identifying research gaps and future direc-
tions, Miller-Graff and Cummings’ (2017) review of
the work done with Israeli and Palestinian youth
concluded that few studies “have included empiri-
cal examinations of resilience. This is somewhat
surprising given that resilience is regularly exam-
ined in the adult research in the region [. . .] and is
a major priority in global research on children and
political violence” (p. 36), a point underscored by
other work identifying global research priorities in
conflict settings (Barber, 2014; Betancourt, Meyers-
Ohki, Charrow, & Tol, 2013; Panter-Brick, 2015).
Their review highlighted the CYRM as a potentially
useful measure in these populations, having been
specifically developed in cross-cultural samples of
adolescents facing adversity. The 28-item CYRM
was developed through focus groups with 89 youth
and adults from 11 high-, middle-, and low-income
countries—including Israel and Palestine—and then
tested with a sample of 1,451 young people from
those 11 countries (Ungar & Liebenberg, 2011).
Although the CYRM has not been specifically vali-
dated with refugee populations, it has been used to
measure the resilience of child and adolescent Syr-
ian refugees in Lebanon (Giordano et al., 2014),
Palestine (Abualkibash & Lera, 2015; Ghannam &
Thabet, 2014), and Finland (Kangaslampi, Garoff, &
Peltonen, 2015).
The CYRM-28 has shown a three-factor structure
corresponding to individual capacities, relationships
with caregivers, and contextual resources in sam-
ples from Canada (Liebenberg, Ungar, & Van de
Vijver, 2012). Work in the Middle Eastern region
suggests that these three factors may hold there as
1804
Panter-Brick et al.
 well (e.g., Ghannam & Thabet, 2014; Zand, Lieben-
berg, & Shamloo, 2016), although comprehensive
analyses of reliability and validity—including factor
structure and item loadings—have not been pro-
vided, nor the Arabic translation made available in
published work. For use in omnibus surveys, a
shorter screening measure with 12 items (CYRM-12)
and a single-factor structure was developed and
validated with two Canadian samples, one at risk
and one population based (Liebenberg, Ungar, &
LeBlanc, 2013).
Alternatively, culturally grounded measures of
risk and resilience can be developed locally from
in-depth
qualitative
work.
In
Afghanistan,
for
example, Eggerman and Panter-Brick (2010) devel-
oped the Problems and Solutions Questionnaire for
use with war-affected youth; respondents were
asked to identify their top five life concerns and the
resources they would draw upon to address them,
leading to a corpus of statements on stress and resi-
lience. Miller et al. (2006) developed the culturally
grounded Afghan Symptom Checklist with adults,
using storytelling to characterize psychosocial well-
being; respondents were asked to describe two peo-
ple known to them, one who was doing well
despite life adversity and one who was doing
poorly.
These
approaches
capture
ethnographic
insights for integration into quantitative surveys, in
ways that are relevant to the study of resilience
(Betancourt, Meyers-Ohki, et al., 2013; Panter-Brick,
2014, 2015). However, multimethod approaches to
develop culturally grounded and psychometrically
valid measures of resilience remain the exception.
Current Study
Our study aimed to develop and validate a brief
measure of resilience for inclusion in a longitudinal
survey of mental health and psychosocial well-
being of refugee and nonrefugee groups in northern
Jordan. After qualitative work to develop culturally
grounded understandings of resilience, we vali-
dated an Arabic-language version of the CYRM for
use with Arabic-speaking adolescent populations.
We chose this instrument on the basis of cultural
relevance and prior usage in conflict-affected set-
tings (Abualkibash & Lera, 2015; Ghannam & Tha-
bet, 2014; Kangaslampi et al., 2015). We adhered to
established guidelines regarding the development
of
instruments
for
transcultural
research
(Van
Ommeren et al., 1999) and systematic attention to
issues of validity and reliability in transcultural sur-
vey
epidemiology
(Pe~
na,
2007;
Van
Ommeren,
2003). We aimed to develop a simple but effective
Arabic-language
tool
that
could
be
used
for
research and program evaluations, and yield mean-
ingful data when implemented as a short survey.
We worked with a sample of Syrian refugee and
Jordanian host-community youth living in urban
centers close to the Syrian border. The Syrian crisis
is now in its 6th year: as of April 2017, over
5.03 million people were forced to leave Syria and
over 650,000 Syrians have taken refuge in Jordan,
half of whom are under 18 years of age. At the
start of the crisis, tens of thousands of Syrian refu-
gees arrived each month, and they now comprise
nearly 10% of the population of Jordan (UNHCR,
2017). The large majority (79%) of Syrian refugees
live in urban settings rather than refugee camps,
significantly increasing pressures on host communi-
ties (UNHCR, 2017). In northern Jordan, Syrians
and Jordanians consider themselves as culturally
similar in terms of faith, social practices, and world-
views, and families have intermarried and traded
across the border. Indeed, there are considerable
demographic and cultural similarities across the
Arab region (Obermeyer, Bott, & Sassine, 2015;
Rashad, 2000), which may have helped Syrian refu-
gees integrate into neighboring countries. There are,
however, marked differences between Syrian refu-
gees and Jordanian hosts in lifetime trauma expo-
sure and displacement history, even though both
groups are described by humanitarian agencies as
conflict affected (Mercy Corps, 2014).
Hypotheses
Five main hypotheses guided our work to assess
the validity and utility of this measure. First, items
will show good face validity in translations, namely
comprehensibility or semantic equivalence (Camp-
bell, Braspenning, Hutchinson, & Marshall, 2002),
being readily understood by children and adoles-
cents, and appearing to capture their resilience. Sec-
ond, the CYRM will have content validity in the
Middle Eastern region, with all three identified
dimensions
of
adolescent
resilience—individual,
relational, and contextual—included and evidencing
conceptual equivalence and relevance in the local
setting (Jordans, Komproe, Tol, & De Jong, 2009).
Both face validity and content validity can be
assessed from
careful analyses of cross-cultural
translation and interview data, with attention paid
to linguistic, functional, and cultural equivalence
(Pe~
na, 2007), in ways that help foster a fine-grained
approach to youth “resilience” and “culture” (Pan-
ter-Brick, 2015). Third, the Arabic CYRM will show
construct validity: The theoretical model of resilience
Resilience in Context
1805
 and corresponding composition of items will be
replicable in different samples (Jordans et al., 2009).
Specifically, the model should have a factor struc-
ture that is replicable for Syrian refugees and Jorda-
nian hosts, as well as replicable for male and
female subsamples. Fourth, it will show measure-
ment reliability with internal consistency and similar
scores over short (7-day) repeated applications.
Finally, it will have convergent validity with sur-
vey variables of interest. Specifically, the CYRM
will
be
positively
associated
with
measures
of
prosocial
function
and
household
wealth,
and
negatively
associated
with
trauma
exposure,
stress, and mental health difficulties for male and
female subsamples. Research and theory suggest
that resilience factors and processes are associated
with
prosociality
(Masten,
2001;
Ungar,
Ghazi-
nour, & Richter, 2013) and resources indexed by
socioeconomic status (Sapienza & Masten, 2011;
Ungar, 2008), as well as negatively related
to
experiences of trauma (Daigneault, Dion, H�
ebert,
McDuff, & Collin-V�
ezina, 2013; Ghannam & Tha-
bet, 2014), stress (H�
ebert, Lavoie, & Blais, 2014),
and internalizing behaviors (Arslan, 2016; Betan-
court, McBain, Newnham, & Brennan, 2013; Zia-
ian et al., 2012).
Method
Study Design
The study was conducted with ethical approval
from Yale University and the Prime Minister’s
Office of Jordan. Informed consent was obtained in
Arabic from all participants (children 11- to 18-
year-olds) and their parents. Families were con-
tacted through humanitarian and community-based
organizations with extensive experience of the area
and were demographically representative of urban
refugee
and
host
communities
in
Jordan
(see
Table 1 for survey participant characteristics, and
Figure 1 for study sites, located 15–50 miles north
of Amman toward Syria).
Qualitative work, instrument preparation, focus
groups,
and
expert
panel
review
took
place
throughout July and August 2015. Seven-day test–
retest data were implemented with samples from
the urban centers of Salt, Mafraq, and Amman
(n = 41 youth). Survey data collection (n = 324 Syri-
ans, n = 279 Jordanians) took place from September
to November 2015, in four community centers in
the cities of Irbid, Jerash, Mafraq, and Ajloun (Fig-
ure 1). At each site, the field team consisted of a
project manager, a field supervisor, and male and
female interviewers. Interviews were conducted in
private, in Arabic, in rooms dedicated for this pur-
pose. Field managers checked data sheets on a daily
basis. Participants were given a small gift of toi-
letries after interview completion in appreciation
for their time and participation.
Qualitative Work for Resilience Conceptualization
To achieve a culturally grounded understanding
of resilience, we piloted three approaches modeled
after previous work in humanitarian settings: (a)
the Problems and Solutions Questionnaire, which
asks youth to articulate top-of-the-mind concerns
and responses to them (Eggerman & Panter-Brick,
2010); (b) the storytelling approach, which asks
youth to describe someone they knew who was
doing well versus doing poorly in the face of
adversity (Miller et al., 2006); and (c) the CYRM,
which
involves
a
preimplementation
qualitative
phase to understand local aspects of resilience,
with prompts such as: “What do you need to
grow up well here?” and “What do you do when
you
face
difficulties
in
your
life?”
(Ungar
&
Liebenberg, 2013).
Survey Measures
Resilience
The CYRM-28 (Liebenberg et al., 2012; Ungar &
Liebenberg, 2011) was translated into Arabic and
adapted for use in this context. Responses ranged
from 1 (not at all) to 5 (a lot), with higher scores
indicating greater resilience. To make the 5-point
Likert scale readily understandable to youth, we
showed participants a simple image of a row of five
glasses that were progressively full of water; this
way of displaying the Likert scale has been success-
fully used in research on psychosocial well-being in
low-resource,
conflict-affected
settings
such
as
Afghanistan (Eggerman & Panter-Brick, 2010; Miller
et al., 2006).
Household Wealth
To measure socioeconomic status, we used a
Wealth Index comprising a list of 12 items which
are relevant to wealth differentials in the local area,
namely, a functioning TV, satellite dish, smart-
phone, car, refrigerator, computer, oven with gas,
bedframe, washing machine, heater, fan, and water
heater. Higher scores indicate greater household
wealth.

Panter-Brick et al.
 Lifetime Trauma
We implemented the 21-item Trauma Events
Checklist, previously used in humanitarian settings
(Panter-Brick, Eggerman, Gonzalez, & Safdar, 2009).
The Checklist asked, “For each event described,
please answer whether or not the event has hap-
pened to you personally, during your lifetime?”
Examples of trauma items were: “Seen someone
else severely beaten, shot or killed,” and “Had your
life in danger,” plus an open-ended item to include
anything else that was “very frightening, dangerous
or violent.” Higher scores indicate exposure to
more traumatic events.
Mental Health, Prosocial Behavior, and Psychosocial
Stress
We used regionally and internationally validated
screening instruments. To assess mental health diffi-
culties, we implemented the 21-item Arab Youth
Mental Health (AYMH) questionnaire (Mahfoud
et al., 2011; Makhoul et al., 2011). We also used the
Arabic version of the Strengths and Difficulties

Resilience in Context
1807
 Questionnaire (SDQ), a brief screening tool for psy-
chiatric difficulties (Alyahri & Goodman, 2006).
This scale has been shown to have clinical validity:
each
1-point
increase
in
child-reported
mental
health difficulties in the SDQ corresponds to an
increased probability of clinician-assigned mental
disorder (Goodman & Goodman, 2009). The 20
items include emotional, conduct, and hyperactivity
symptom
scores.
The
SDQ
prosocial
subscale,
which featured five items regarding caring and
being helpful to others, was used to assess proso-
ciality. To measure psychosocial stress and distress,
we implemented the Arabic version of the Per-
ceived
Stress
Scale
(PSS;
Cohen,
Kamarck,
&
Mermelstein, 1983), validated with a Jordanian sam-
ple (Almadi, Cathers, Mansour, & Chow, 2012),
and the 12-item Human Distress scale (Hamayel &
Ghandour, 2014), developed for use with conflict-
affected
adolescents
in
the
West
Bank.
Higher
scores on these measures indicate more mental
health difficulties, prosocial behaviors, stress, and
distress, respectively.
Statistical Analyses
We examined the sample using standard descrip-
tive statistics. To establish face and content valid-
ity,
expert
review
panels
examined
data
from
Figure 1. Map of study sites and the surrounding area (Google Maps, n.d.). All study sites are written in capitals. Interviews and focus
groups to examine local conceptualizations of resilience took place in Jerash. In-depth focus groups discussion on the face validity of
the Child and Youth Resilience Measure (CYRM) items and an initial pilot of its Arabic translation took place in Mafraq. A third focus
group discussion on the CYRM items took place at the Zaatari refugee camp, located east of Mafraq. The final survey data collection
took place at Irbid, Jerash, Mafraq, and Zarqa. Test-retest data on the CYRM were collected in Mafraq, Salt, and Amman. [Color figure

 translations, qualitative work, and the pilot survey
regarding culturally relevant dimensions of resili-
ence. For construct validity, we conducted confir-
matory factor analyses (CFA) on the CYRM-28,
using the item and three-factor structure described
by Liebenberg et al. (2012) on a random half of the
sample. We then used CFA to shorten the CYRM-
28 until we reached good model fit, removing items
that resulted in an improvement of the chi-square
by at least 10, as identified by the modification
indices. We tested the model fit in the second half
of the sample, as replication of factorial composi-
tion in a second sample is an indicator of construct
validity (Devins et al., 1988). Finally, we tested the
model fit for the resulting Arabic-language CYRM-
12 scale in separate groupings of boys, girls, refu-
gees, and nonrefugees. Subsequently, we used the
full sample to conduct two multigroup analyses (by
refugee status and gender), first with invariant fac-
tor loadings and then with invariant common resid-
ual covariances. Model fit was determined through
root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA),
standardized root mean square residual (SRMR),
and comparative fit index (CFI). Model fit is accept-
able where the RMSEA is ≤ .06 with an upper limit
of the confidence interval of < .08, SRMR is ≤ .08,
and CFI is > .90 (Hox, 2010; Hu & Bentler, 1999).
To test convergent validity, we examined associ-
ations between CYRM scores and prosocial behav-
ior (SDQ prosocial subscale), measures of wealth
(Wealth Index), trauma exposure (events on the
trauma checklist), mental health difficulties (sepa-
rate analyses with the AYMH, SDQ total difficul-
ties), and psychosocial stress (separate analyses
with PSS, Human Distress scale). These analyses
were conducted on the overall, gender-specific, and
refugee/nonrefugee samples to ensure that correla-
tions were in the expected direction for main sub-

of
participants.
Specifically,
we
tested
whether CYRM scores were positively related to
prosocial behavior and household wealth, and neg-
atively related to trauma exposure, mental health
difficulties, and stress. Finally, we compared the
correlation between the CYRM and trauma expo-
sure by refugee status. Analyses were conducted
with SPSS v.22 and MPlus v. 7.31.
Results
Qualitative Work and Pilot Surveys: Establishing
Content and Face Validity
To establish culturally relevant conceptualiza-
tions and measures of resilience, we conducted
informal interviews with youth and staff from com-
munity-based organizations while setting up the
project, then formally convened two groups (15
boys, 11 girls, both refugees and nonrefugees) in
Jerash city to initiate structured conversations and
implement the Problems and Solutions Question-
naire, storytelling on wellness and resilience, and
specific prompts from the CYRM manual. During
such
conversations,
the
term
“resilience”
was
unproblematically rendered in Arabic by the word
muruuna (lit: resilience, in the sense of flexibility),
for both boys and girls. Interviews were useful for
establishing a vocabulary for talking about adver-
sity, risk, and resilience, and for examining differ-
ences
across
refugee/nonrefugee
groups.
Youth
strongly emphasized that Syrians and Jordanians
shared the same cultural views, religious practices,
and family traditions—and when it came to Syrian
and Jordanian friends, “we treat them all in the
same way.” The refugee/nonrefugee context, how-
ever, created subtle differences in how young peo-
ple drew strength from their community. Although
Jordanian youth valued having “a role model” and
“the ability to improve” within the immediate com-
munity, Syrian refugees articulated capacities that
reflected experiences of forced displacement: For
them, resilience was evidenced through being able
to live in the community with good relationships
and a good attitude, feeling resettled in Jordan, still
having an ambition or a dream they wanted to
achieve, believing that learning was still an impor-
tant thing in life, and feeling that traumatic experi-
ences were no longer distressing. For both refugee
and nonrefugee youth, reliance on family ties was
paramount:
Expectations
about
self
were
inter-
twined with family situations. Social ties were also
viewed through the lens of tribal affiliations, com-
plicating notions of the “community.”
When reviewing these data, our local research
team emphasized that qualitative methods required
a great deal of time and skilled interviewing, and
expressed a strong preference for moving forward
with a brief quantitative tool. Specifically, the team
considered the CYRM scale to be easily imple-
mentable and its Likert scale readily understood.
The team also judged the CYRM to be valuable in
capturing locally relevant dimensions of resilience,
especially in giving salience to the importance of
family relationships and religious expression. We
next convened 20 girls (Syrian refugee and Jorda-
nian) in Mafraq city to conduct an in-depth focus
group discussion on the face validity of CYRM
items, and we piloted its Arabic translation with a
group of 16 Syrian boys living in Zaatari refugee
Resilience in Context
1809
 camp. We then organized an expert panel discus-
sion with bilingual fieldworkers, Syrian/Jordanian
scholars with expertise in child development, North
American academics experienced in cross-cultural
research on child and adolescent resilience, and
scholars in Middle Eastern studies, to review the
face validity and construct reliability of responses
to date. This led to a third, final round of refining
the translation, checking the back translation, and
focus group discussions with another 16 youth (10
boys and 6 girls).
We reviewed translations for language issues,
phrasing items in modern standard Arabic (the lan-
guage of print and broadcasting media) rather than
colloquial Arabic; dialects vary substantially across
the Middle Eastern region, which could limit the
usefulness
of
a
scale
reflecting
local
everyday
speech. We independently back translated the scale
three times to resolve discrepancies and difficulties
for a number of specific items (Table 2). A few of
the CYRM-28 items needed careful adaptation in
Arabic to ensure cultural and contextual relevance.
For example, Item 5 (My parent(s)/caregiver(s)
watch me closely) had negative connotations as it
implied a form of surveillance over girls—it was
modified to “My family/relatives really watch out
for me.” Item 9 (“Spiritual beliefs are a source of
strength to me”) led to vigorous discussion regard-
ing how the Arabic phrasing might best denote a
sense of connectedness rather than adherence to the
practice of religion; the final phrasing was “Religion
and faith are a source of strength to me.” Item 13
(“I am able to solve problems without harming
myself or others [for example, by using drugs and/
or being violent])” was modified to “I am able to
solve problems without resorting to aggression or
the use of violence.”
Notably, Item 11 (“People think that I am fun to
be with”) was changed to “People like to spend
time with me” because refugee youth claimed that
a sense of “fun” was inapplicable to their current
existence. Again the word “enjoy” in Items 26 and
27 was translated to a word akin to “enjoy/am
proud,” given that a concept of enjoyment did not
resonate in this setting. The word “citizen” in Item
28 (“I am proud to be a citizen of ____ country”)
was hotly debated, partly because refugees may not
all have obtained legal documents in their host
country and partly because it implied a political
statement about the incumbent government or mili-
tary groups within Syria. The essence of this item
was to capture a sense of belonging. This was
solved by removing the word “citizen” to say most
simply: “I am proud to be Syrian/Jordanian” (or
both, where youth declared a dual lineage). Item 27
(“I enjoy the traditions of my community”) elicited
requests for clarification. For Syrian refugees, this
statement could be interpreted as “do you feel more
Jordanian than Syrian?” Enjoyment of traditions
also had a gender dimension: Girls noted that Jor-
danian and Syrian families could differ with respect
to enforcing gender-specific restrictions on their
movements. The item was changed to, “I enjoy par-
ticipating in the customs and traditions of the com-
munity in which I am living now.” Finally, we
clarified the use of Item 16 (“I feel I belong at
school”) to allow refugee youth who were no
longer attending school to skip the question or to
respond based on prior school attendance in Syria.
Final Surveys: Construct Validity
Once the Arabic CYRM-28 scale was finalized,
we
administered
the
full
survey
to
a
gender-
balanced sample of 603 participants, aged 14.22
(SD = 1.81) years (Table 1), recruited through a
humanitarian
organization
in
urban
centers
of
Jerash, Mafraq, Irbid, and Ajloun. As expected,
sociodemographic characteristics differed for refu-
gees and nonrefugees. For example, Syrian refu-
gees, who had spent on average 3 years inside
Jordan, averaged 6.53 (SD = 3.33) lifetime traumas;
by contrast, Jordanians averaged many fewer (1.21,
SD = 1.75) lifetime trauma events. Similarly, refu-
gee youth and their parents had attended fewer
years of education than Jordanian counterparts and
had lower socioeconomic status as indicated by the
Household Wealth Index (all p < .05).
We conducted a CFA on the CYRM-28 on a ran-
dom half of the sample (Table 3). Although the inter-
nal reliability of the measure (a = .87 in first half)
was good, model fit was poor, v2(347) = 851.70,
p < .001;
CFI = .75;
RMSEA = .07
[.06,
.07],
SRMR = .06. We also ran a CFA to test model fit for
the CYRM-12 with the one-factor structure, resulting
in
poor
model
fit,
v2(51) = 128.92,
p < .001;
CFI = .85; RMSEA = .07 [.05, .08], SRMR = .05. We
shortened the CYRM-28 with CFA until we came to
a good fitting model, namely, a 12-item measure
with four items in each factor (Table 4). We then
tested the model fit for this 12-item measure in the
second random half of the sample, where it also had
good fit. Following this, we tested the CYRM-12
model fit in gender-specific, refugee/nonrefugee
groups, all of which had good fit (Table 5).
In multigroup analyses by refugee status and gen-
der (Table 5), the model fit was acceptable for refu-
gee/nonrefugees—suggesting
factorial
invariance
1810
Panter-Brick et al.
 across both groups of conflict-affected youth—but
was not acceptable for gender, despite good fit
when analyses were run separately for boys and for
girls.
Consequently,
we
examined
the
loadings
(standardized coefficients) for each item in analyses
of
gender-differentiated
samples
(Table 6).
For

 individual strengths, knowing where to go in the
community for help (Item 15) and having opportu-
nities to develop skills that are useful later in life
(Item 25) were relatively more important for boys.
With respect to relational strengths, having parents
know a lot about them (Item 6) and having family
stand by them during difficult times (Item 17) were
relatively more important for girls, whereas feeling
safe with family (Item 24) was relatively more
important for boys. For contextual strengths, believ-
ing that an education is important (Item 3), feeling
that religion and faith are a source of strength (Item
9), and participating in organized religious activities
(Item 22) were relatively more important for boys.
Our interview data helped contextualize such
results. Youth believed their families would know
everything about their lives: statements such as “if
anything happened to me, someone else would tell
them if I didn’t, so I have to tell them everything”
reflect the realities of close-knit community life.
They also stated that parents tracked girls more clo-
sely, and would provide girls with more parental
support as boys were expected to be “tough” in
solving their own problems. The issue of safety was
more salient for boys, who spent more time outside
the home, met more people, and confronted chal-
lenging situations, leading them to value security at
home. Given access to more contacts and resources,
boys were also in a relatively better place to value
opportunities for skills building and connections in
the community. For boys, assuming a breadwinner
role was a source of pride and major responsibility,

 while for girls, home-based skills were enough to
meet social expectations focused on taking care of
the family. Educational expectations were also gen-
der differentiated: Although education was “the
future” in providing “the knowledge to achieve
something,” boys saw it as a gateway to better
work, and girls knew they were expected not to
work but to marry. With respect to religious activi-
ties, participation for boys habitually takes the form
of
collective
prayer
in
the
mosque;
organized
religious activities are minimal for girls. Thus, cul-
tural expectations regarding the use of available
resources and social responsibilities help to explain
the gendered responses to resilience items.

Following validation of the scale in both sam-
ples, we tested its internal consistency. Cronbach’s

 (.75) and nonrefugee (.75) youth (Table 1). Fre-
quency distributions were examined for ceiling and
floor effects: 3.20% of youth attained the maximum
score (60), whereas none reported the lowest possi-
ble value (12). As reported elsewhere (Daigneault
et al., 2013; Liebenberg et al., 2012), there are skews
to CYRM data; in our sample, most participants
scored above the scale’s halfway point (M = 50.30,
SD = 6.71, range = 25–60).
We conducted paired samples t tests on test–ret-
est data (22 refugee and 20 nonrefugee youth; 50%
male;
Mage = 14.07 years,
SDage = 2.08).
Both
CYRM-28 scores, t(41) = �.54, p > .05, and CYRM-
12 scores, t(40) = �.05, p > .05, were consistent over
7 days. The correlation coefficient for the CYRM-12
over the 7-day interval was .93, indicating good sta-
bility of scores.
Convergent Validity
The CYRM-12 was highly correlated with the
CYRM-28
(r = .92,
p < .001).
As
expected,
we
observed positive associations with the Household
Wealth Index (CYRM-12: r = .12, p < .05; CYRM-28:
r = .17, p < .001 in the overall sample), for both gen-
ders, and for Jordanians (Table 7). Associations
between CYRM-12 and lifetime trauma exposure
were similar by gender but differed for Syrian
refugees and Jordanian hosts: we observed a nega-
tive correlation for Jordanians (r = �.18, p < .05) and
a nonsignificant correlation for Syrians (r = �.01,
p > .05, Table 7). This is consistent with interview
data that show that, for Syrian refugees, resilience
consisted of not only the ability to overcome the dis-
tress of past trauma but also the ability to cope with
current adversity. It is notable that, relative to their
host community, independent samples t tests show
that Syrian refugees achieved only marginally lower
resilience scores (CYRM-12, Syrians: M = 49.56; Jor-
danians:
M = 51.16,
p < .05;
CYRM-28,
Syrians:
M = 111.41; Jordanians: M = 116.03, p < .001), given
levels of trauma exposure (Syrians: M = 6.53 events;
Jordanians: M = 1.21 events, p < .001; Table 1).
Resilience was positively associated with proso-
cial behaviors (CYRM-12: r = .31, p < .001; CYRM-
28: r = .35, p < .001) and inversely associated with
SDQ

(CYRM-12:

and refugee/nonrefugee subgroups (Table 7). Cor-
relations were in the expected direction, and consis-
tent across gender and nationality. We regressed

Discussion
Given the impacts of war on children and adoles-
cents, the scale of forced displacement in the wake
of the Syrian crisis, and efforts to resettle refugees
into host communities in Middle Eastern and Wes-
tern countries (UNHCR, 2015, 2016), instruments
that assess the underlying constructs of psychoso-
cial
resilience
are
urgently
needed
to
inform
research, practice, and policy. Specifically, humani-
tarian agencies require a reliable and valid Arabic-
language measure of child and adolescent resilience
to effectively measure whether their programs pro-
mote
the
acquisition
of
resources
relevant
to
improved youth well-being. We believe that the
CYRM-12 meets these criteria. It results in one over-
all score, corresponding to the individual, relational,
and contextual dimensions of resilience. It displays
face, content, construct, and convergent validity as
well as showing test–retest reliability and internal
consistency. By contrast, the CYRM-28 had poor fit
for this refugee and host-community sample.
The CYRM functions as a good tool for epidemi-
ological research when used in conjunction with
instruments that screen for psychosocial stress and
mental health difficulties. It can usefully comple-
ment the SDQ, an instrument used in over 40 cul-
tures to screen for emotional/conduct difficulties
and prosocial functioning in this target age group,
including
conflict-affected
and
displaced
youth
(Cummings et al., 2012; Panter-Brick et al., 2009). In
this study, an increase of 4.5 points on the CYRM-
12 scale (range = 12–60) was associated with a 1-
point decrease on the SDQ total difficulties scale, a
change of likely clinical relevance. The CYRM-12
also relates to SDQ prosocial scores, a measure of
prosocial behavior (Table 7).
Although resilience necessarily occurs within the
context of risk, resilience is not the mirror image of
risk (Hobfoll, 2012; Panter-Brick, 2014). In our sam-
ple, Jordanians experienced few lifetime traumas,
and the number of trauma events was found inver-
sely related to their resilience scores. By contrast,
Syrian refugees experienced high trauma exposure,
and notably, their higher exposure to past trauma
did not necessarily equate to lower resilience scores:
Some refugee youth described gaining strength
from
overcoming
past
traumatic
experiences,
whereas others struggled to cope with distress and
difficulties.
As
argued
elsewhere
(Panter-Brick,
2015), we should not expect simple associations
between risk, resilience, and adversity.
In these communities, resilience—muruuna—was
the cultural and functional equivalent of flexibility
or adaptability. By contrast, in the Palestinian con-
text, words such as sumud express the political
dimensions of resilience through a determination to
be steadfast and rooted to the land (Nguyen-Gill-
ham, Giacaman, Naser, & Boyce, 2008; Panter-Brick,
2015). Muruuna can be likened to the flexibility and
durable strength of bamboo in weathering high
winds (a metaphor used by Southwick et al., 2011).
In this study, 11- to 18-year-old Syrian refugees
drew strength from positive relationships in their
community, feeling resettled, being able to maintain
an ambition, believing that learning was still impor-
tant,
and
overcoming
stress
from
traumatic

age displacement and resettlement. For their part,
Jordanian youth in the host community valued role
models and the ability to improve—reflecting expe-
riences of more stable communities and expecta-
tions of future opportunities. For both groups,
family relations were paramount to accessing and
negotiating social, economic, and political resources
—and were more salient than peer or school-based
relationships. This reflects a local reality: In the
Arab world, the family is fundamental to leverag-
ing resources, as it works to constrain or enable the
younger generation in matters of school, marriage,
or
employment.
In
terms
of
conservation
of
resources theory (Hobfoll, 2012), immediate and
extended families are the fundamental units to
access resources, withstand losses, and negotiate
social landscapes. Yet current literature has “sur-
prisingly abundant gaps” in the empirical evidence
on
family
and
community
resilience
(Bonanno,
Romero, & Klein, 2015, p. 161).
With respect to gender, nuanced differences are
to
be
expected
in
the
Middle
Eastern
region.
Although the 12-item CYRM was a reliable and
valid instrument for both girls and boys, certain
protective factors were differentially important by
gender. Participants were quick to articulate gen-
der-differentiated
social,
economic,
and
cultural
expectations with respect to parental support/mon-
itoring, opportunities for skills building in the com-
munity, social expectations related to education,
and participation in organized religious activities.
Although there were gender differences regarding
which items appear to matter most to dimensions
of resilience, there were no differences in overall
CYRM scores by gender. This is consistent with
other studies that find that adolescent girls and
boys in the Middle East have similar CYRM-28
scores (e.g., Ghannam & Thabet, 2014; Zand et al.,
2016).
Study Limitations
This
study
had
four
main
limitations.
First,
although we established face, content, construct,
and convergent validity, we were not able to evalu-
ate the Arabic CYRM for criterion or clinical valid-
ity.
Second,
we
focused
on
the
constructs
of
resilience rather than processes over time (our tra-
jectory data are forthcoming). Some longitudinal
studies suggest that using a single self-report scale
to measure resilience can have limited predictive
utility (Bonanno et al., 2015); however, the CYRM-
12 can be used in repeated assessments to identify
which cohorts of children and adolescents manage
better outcomes over time and also identify how
changes or lack of changes are driven by resource
provision or systems of care. Third, the Cronbach’s
alpha for the CYRM-12 (.75), although acceptable,
is lower than the alpha for CYRM-28 (.87) in this
sample and other studies using the CYRM-28 in the
region (e.g., .92 for Abualkibash & Lera, 2015; .93
for Ghannam & Thabet, 2014). Moreover, the low
alpha for the SDQ prosocial subscale (.55) suggests
construct heterogeneity or poor item interrelated-
ness, as found elsewhere (e.g., Muris, Meesters, &
van den Berg, 2003). Finally, although we devel-
oped and tested the scale for refugee and non-
refugee samples in a humanitarian crisis setting, we
did not extend the survey to Syrian nonrefugees, to
economically well-off Jordanians, or to youth in
other areas of Jordan.
Conclusions
Contextually relevant, validated resilience mea-
sures are necessary to meet the call of researchers
who argue that the next wave of resilience research
needs to be more systematic, thoughtful, scalable,
integrated, culturally relevant, temporally explicit,
and policy applicable (Ager, 2013; Bonanno et al.,
2011, 2015; Hobfoll et al., 2015; Masten, 2014; Pan-
ter-Brick, 2014; Ungar et al., 2013). Moreover, valid
and reliable measures of resilience are needed to
complement research on the underlying constructs
of psychosocial distress for children living in areas
affected
by
conflict
(Betancourt,
Meyers-Ohki,
et al., 2013; Jordans et al., 2009; Panter-Brick, 2015).
Our study addresses gaps identified in resilience
research in the Middle East (Miller-Graff & Cum-
mings, 2017); it provides an empirical examination
of
resilience
for
refugee
and
host-community
youth, advances the psychometric validation of a
brief field-friendly scale, and provides Arabic trans-
lation of culturally grounded items (see Tables S1
and S2 for 12-item and 28-item scales, as imple-
mented in the field). Indeed, our study is the first
to present a detailed examination of cultural rele-
vance and psychometric validity of an Arabic ver-
sion of the CYRM. The 12-item Arabic CYRM was
found to be a valid and reliable measure of self-
reported resilience in Arabic-speaking refugee and
host-community youth. It is useful for capturing
the individual, relational, and contextual aspects of
psychosocial resilience and will hopefully spur fur-
ther work on the family and community dimen-
sions of resilience for boys and girls, refugee and
nonrefugee youth.
