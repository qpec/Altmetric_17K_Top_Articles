Abstract
Background and objectives Patients with CKD are advised to follow dietary recommendations that restrict
individual nutrients. Emerging evidence indicates overall eating patterns may better predict clinical outcomes,
however, current data on dietary patterns in kidney disease are limited.
Design, setting, participants, & measurements This systematic review aimed to evaluate the association between
dietary patterns and mortality or ESRD among adults with CKD. Medline, Embase, and reference lists were sys-
tematically searched uptoNovember 24,2015 by twoindependentreview authors. Eligible studies werelongitudinal
cohort studies reporting the association of dietary patterns with mortality, cardiovascular events, or ESRD.
Results A total of seven studies involving 15,285 participants were included. Healthy dietary patterns were
generally higher in fruit and vegetables, fish, legumes, cereals, whole grains, and fiber, and lower in red meat, salt,
and refined sugars. In six studies, healthy dietary patterns were consistently associated with lower mortality
(3983 events; adjusted relative risk, 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.63 to 0.83; risk difference of 46 fewer (29–63
fewer) events per 1000 people over 5 years). There was no statistically significant association between healthy
dietary patterns and risk of ESRD (1027 events; adjusted relative risk, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.68 to 1.40).
Conclusions Healthy dietary patterns are associated with lower mortality in people with kidney disease.
Interventions to support adherence to increased fruit and vegetable, fish, legume, whole grain, and fiber intake,
and reduced red meat, sodium, and refined sugar intake could be effective tools to lower mortality in people with
kidney disease.

Introduction
CKD affects about 10%–13% of adults (1) and
represents a public health challenge because of the sub-
stantially increased risks of death and cardiovascular
disease among affected people (2,3). Patients who
have CKD are advised to follow dietary recommen-
dations that restrict individual nutrients, such as
phosphorus, salt, potassium, and protein, to prevent
short- and long-term clinical complications (4). His-
torically, dietary advice has been given on the basis
of individual nutrients or food groups instead of
whole eating patterns, despite being considered com-
plex, challenging to adhere to, and an intense burden
for some patients (5). In addition, there is limited
evidence that restricting or supplementing specific
nutrients or single food groups effectively prevents
clinical complications, including kidney failure or
death (6–9). Fluid and dietary restrictions remain
frequently identified as priority areas of research
by patients with kidney disease and health care pro-
viders (10).
Recent evidence has linked dietary patterns rich in
fruit and vegetables, fish, legumes, cereals, and nuts
with reduced cardiovascular events and death in
healthy adults and those at high risk of cardiovascular
disease (11–14). In parallel, there is an emerging
trend toward the study of whole dietary patterns
rather than single nutrient or food group restrictions
among people with kidney disease (15–17). However,
existing cohort studies of dietary patterns in people
with kidney disease have small sample sizes, whereas
existing randomized trials are insufficiently powered
to establish the role of whole dietary patterns on mor-
tality and kidney failure, limiting the impact of single
studies to inform clinical practice and policy (18,19).
Existing dietary guidelines lack robust evidence for
effects on patient-centered outcomes (20).
The aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis
of the evidentiary basis for the association of dietary
patterns with mortality and cardiovascular end points,
in order to establish the potential role of dietary patterns
among people with CKD.
Materials and Methods
Our primary aim was to assess the association of
healthy dietary patterns with the risk of mortality and
ESRD in adults with CKD. This systematic review

 followed a prespecified review protocol, was prospectively
registered in the International Prospective Register of
Systematic Reviews (21) and was reported using the pre-
ferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-
analysis (22).
Data Sources and Searches
We searched Medline, Embase, and reference lists of
retrieved studies for prospective cohort studies available
online reporting the association between dietary patterns
and clinical outcomes among adults who have CKD on
November 24, 2015. We did not have any language or date
restriction for the search. The search terms are shown in
Supplemental Table 1.
Study Selection
Dietary patterns were defined as overall habitual food
intake ascertained by healthy eating guidelines or a priori diet
quality score, dietary pattern analysis, and/or consumption
of whole food groups such as fruit and vegetables. We ex-
cluded single nutrient or food group–based modifications
from this review, including isolated protein or sodium re-
striction. We required follow-up for at least 24 weeks to
ensure sufficient follow-up of dietary patterns on patient-
level outcomes, and explicit reporting of outcomes either
as raw data or adjusted effect estimates with 95% confidence
intervals (95% CIs). We used definitions of CKD according
to international clinical practice guidelines (4).
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Two authors (J.T.K. and S.N.W.) independently reviewed
all retrieved records for eligibility using reference man-
agement software. The two authors extracted data and
adjudicated risk of bias, with differences resolved by
discussion. We contacted authors for information that was
missing or unclear from included studies. The risk of bias
was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa tool (23). We
then used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment,
Development, and Evaluation methodology to rate the
quality of the evidence for mortality as high, moderate,
low, or very low (24). Observational studies began as low
quality evidence, but could be rated upward to moderate
or high quality evidence if they collectively demonstrated
a large magnitude of effect, or a dose–response gradient.
Outcomes were death, health-related quality of life, ESRD,
major cardiovascular events, BP, serum cholesterol, and
major adverse events.
Data Synthesis and Analysis
We carried out analyses according to a predefined
protocol to compare healthy eating patterns (generally
higher intake of fruit, vegetables, cereals, legumes, whole
grains, fiber, and fish, and lower intake of red meat, salt,
and refined sugar) with dietary intake less representative
of these eating patterns. We then summarized adjusted
risks (hazard ratio, odds ratio, or relative risk) provided
in studies using random-effects inverse variance meta-
analysis. A fixed-effect model was also used to ensure
robustness of the model chosen and susceptibility to
outliers. Estimated numbers of events incurred or avoided
with dietary change were calculated as a risk difference on
the basis of a 5-year risk of mortality reported in a
systematic review of cohort studies (25). We used the I2
statistic to assess heterogeneity (the proportion of total
variation observed in the association of dietary intake
and outcome among studies beyond that expected by
chance), with an I2 value ,25% considered as low hetero-
geneity and .75% as high heterogeneity. We assessed for
small study effects in analyses for mortality by visual eval-
uation of the funnel plot for symmetry.
Sensitivity analyses were done, excluding studies in
which the same cohort of participants may have been
represented more than once and those involving adults
with ESRD. We planned subgroup analyses on the basis of
sex, duration of follow-up, study quality, and geographical
region. Analyses were performed using Stata 13, with 95%
CIs, excluding a risk ratio of 1.0 used to denote statistical
significance.
Results
Study Selection and Baseline Characteristics
The systematic search yielded seven cohort studies
(Figure 1), involving 15,285 patients with CKD (Table 1)
(17,26–31). The participants were followed for between 4
and 13 years on average, totaling approximately 91,000
person-years of follow-up. All but one study involved
people with CKD defined as an eGFR,60–70 ml/min
per 1.73 m2 body surface area or albuminuria (17,26–30).
One study enrolled adults treated with dialysis (31). Studies
involved people living in the United States (17,26,27,29,30),
Sweden (28), and Japan (31). Healthy dietary patterns
were reported as generally consistent with a higher in-
take of fruits and vegetables, legumes, cereals, whole
grains, fiber, and fish, and lower intake of red meat and
products containing sodium and refined sugars (Table 2).
All studies were published between 2013 and 2015. There
were 3983 deaths and 1027 ESRD events recorded during
follow-up.
Risk of Bias and Evidence Quality
Risks of bias in the included studies is shown in Sup-
plemental Figure 1. Overall, studies were considered at
low risk of bias for characteristics considered important
to the reliability of cohort studies. When the Grading of
Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evalu-
ation (directness, precision, consistency, and study limita-
tions) recommendations were considered, the evidence
quality for all-cause mortality was considered low on
the basis of the nonrandomized study design, without in-
curring further downgrades in evidence quality for indi-
rectness, imprecise results, heterogeneity, or study
reporting limitation.
Outcomes
All-Cause Mortality. When compared with other die-
tary patterns, a dietary pattern richer in vegetables,
fruit, fish, cereals, whole grains, fiber, legumes, and nuts
and seeds, and lower in red meat, sodium, and refined
sugars was associated with a lower risk of death. In six
studies among 13,930 participants followed for between
4 and 13 years, the relative risk of all-cause mortality
was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.63 to 0.83) (Figure 2). There was no

 heterogeneity between studies (I2=0%) and no evidence
of small study effects (Supplemental Figure 2). On the
basis of an estimated 5-year mortality of 17% in people
with CKD (25), the risk difference with a healthy die-
tary pattern compared with other dietary patterns was
46 fewer deaths per 1000 people (29–63 fewer) over
5 years.
ESRD. There was no evidence of an association between
a healthy dietary pattern and risk of ESRD in three studies
(n=10,071 people), with follow-up ranging from 4 to 6.4 years.
The risk of ESRD among people with CKD was 1.04 (95% CI,
0.68 to 1.40) with no evidence of statistical heterogeneity
between studies (Figure 3).
Major Cardiovascular Events, Health-Related Quality
of Life, Adverse Events, and BP. There were insufficient
numbers of studies to conduct meta-analysis for risks of
major cardiovascular events. In one study involving 3006
people, a healthy diet score was not associated with risk of
atherosclerotic events (adjusted relative risk, 1.01; 95% CI,
0.47 to 2.18) (17). In a single study among 1355 dialysis
patients, an “unbalanced dietary pattern” of high sodium
and vegetable intake and lower fish and meat intake was
associated with a higher risk of a composite of hospitali-
zation because of cardiovascular disease or death because
of any cause (31).
There was no reporting of health-related quality of life,
cardiovascular-related death, adverse events, or hyperkaliemia
as individual end points. There was no information about
the effects of healthy dietary patterns on BP or serum
cholesterol levels during follow-up.
Sensitivity Analyses
Results were similar when single studies were removed
to exclude the possibility that participants had been in-
cluded in analyses more than once (Supplemental Table 2).
There was no evidence that results in meta-analyses for
mortality were different on the basis of country of origin,
age, duration of follow-up time, or quality of studies (Sup-
plemental Table 3).
Discussion
This meta-analysis, comprised of approximately 90,000
person-years of follow-up and including 3983 mortality
events, showed that dietary patterns rich in vegetables
and fruits, legumes, whole grains, and fiber together with
lower consumption of red meat, sodium, and refined
sugars were consistently associated with lower mortality
in people with CKD. Existing cohort studies provide
evidence of the association of healthy dietary patterns
with risk of ESRD, major cardiovascular complications,
and health-related quality of life, although there is con-
siderable uncertainty in the results for these outcomes
because of wide confidence intervals from meta-analyses
that included few studies. To our knowledge, this is the
first cumulative assessment of whole dietary patterns and

 their association with mortality and clinical complications
in people with CKD.
The association of healthy dietary patterns with lower
mortality in people with CKD is in contrast to the lack of
association of restrictions of individual dietary components for
food groups including serum phosphorus (7,32,33), sodium (6),
and protein (34) intake with mortality, although individual
studies addressing these questions have had small sample sizes
and low power to discern the relative association of nutritional
modifications on clinical outcomes. The findings of the current
meta-analysis are consistent with accruing large-scale evidence
of consistent mortality benefits with adherence to a plant-based
dietary pattern among people without existing chronic dis-
ease (35), although in a large randomized controlled trial on
Mediterranean diet, a primarily plant-based diet including
extra virgin olive oil or nuts, there was no statistical evidence
of lower mortality alone in people at high risk of cardiovas-
cular events, while a Mediterranean dietary pattern lowered
the risk of a composite of nonfatal and fatal cardiovascular
events (11). To date, randomized trials testing the effects of
dietary patterns rich in fruits and vegetables or a Mediterra-
nean diet in adults with kidney disease are preliminary and
have not examined mortality as an end point (18,36,37). As
in our study, there is limited evidence for the association of
eating patterns with risk of ESRD in the literature, although
cohort studies suggest dietary patterns rich in fruit and veg-
etables may lower risk of progression to CKD and decrease
albuminuria and BP (38–42).
Recent research in CKD has seen a shift from the
decades-long focus on assessing and modifying single
nutrient components of diet among people with CKD,
reflected in practice guidelines (4), to an increasing analysis
of whole dietary patterns. As a result, this study shows
accumulating evidence over the last 5 years of analyses
that consider all food groups thought to be important for
health. While existing single nutrient approaches have had
limited impact on health in people with kidney disease,
this study on the building evidence for healthy dietary
patterns on mortality risk suggests that this shift to wider
dietary approaches across several food groups is appro-
priate and aligns with existing patient priorities (10).
Given the prevalence of CKD in the community, data sup-
porting specific dietary patterns potentially has an impor-
tant public health impact, and warrants the prioritization

 of additional resources to support a randomized trial of
dietary intake in this population. Highly efficient trial de-
sign, embedded within registries or electronic health re-
cords, might increase the feasibility and reduce the costs
of an adequately powered dietary trial in the wider pop-
ulation with kidney disease. This is particularly relevant
given the progressive shift toward more Western dietary
patterns (43) and the relative lack of treatments proven to
lower the burden of premature death and kidney failure
among people with kidney disease. A recent additional
cohort study showing a dose–dependent association be-
tween red meat intake and risk of ESRD, and lower risks
when other sources of protein are substituted, further
adds weight to the need to understand the association
of whole food dietary patterns with clinical outcomes in
the setting of kidney disease (44).
Although this study was prospectively planned and
conducted independently by two authors, providing highly
consistent findings among studies and precise risk estimates
for the mortality end point, some limitations of this study can
be identified. First, the healthy dietary patterns we identified
were not standardized and represent a heterogeneous range
of dietary intake. For example, some dietary patterns in-
cluded milk products as healthy food groups (27), whereas
others defined milk and milk product intake as less desirable
(26,28,30). However, the key elements of greater fruit and
vegetable intake were present in all studies. Second, these
studies were on the basis of dietary self-recalls via differing
methods (food frequency questionnaires versus food re-
cords), although the results among all studies were consis-
tent, and not apparently influenced by this factor. Third,
included patients had a range of kidney function, although
all had an eGFR,60–70 ml/min per 1.73 m2 or albuminuria.
Fourth, all of the studies included in meta-analysis for mor-
tality were conducted in the United States or Sweden, and
thus the results may not be generalizable to other global
regions, including lower resourced regions. Fifth, we did
not find any association of dietary change with ESRD.
ESRD is a rarer complication of CKD because of the com-
peting risk of death; accumulated studies evaluating the as-
sociations of diet with this outcome had relatively few
recorded events, as would be expected, even when linked
to dialysis census databases. Sixth, it was not possible to
assess for evidence of publication bias. Finally, this study
is based on nonrandomized data, leading to the potential
for the findings to be partly explained by residual confound-
ing and leading to lower quality evidence. The results are
hypothesis-generating and represent an important indication
for a future randomized trial and public policy, particularly
as dietary and lifestyle interventions are highly ranked re-
search priorities by patients and clinicians.
In summary, this meta-analysis shows that adherence to
dietary patterns rich in fruit and vegetables, fish, legumes,
cereals, whole grains, and fiber, and lower in red meat and
products containing sodium and refined sugars is associated
with lower mortality in people with CKD. This finding
represents a shift in evidence from management of single
nutrient or food groups in the care of kidney disease, and
aligns with the experiences of patients who describe nutri-
tional advice as frequently complex and difficult to follow.
This evidence might prompt the prioritization of randomized
trials of dietary patterns among people with kidney disease,
as well as the re-evaluation of dietary advice as a public
health tool to lower mortality in people with kidney disease.
