Background: The ability to decrease inflammation and promote healing is important in the intervention
and management of a variety of disease states, including osteoarthritis of the knee (OAK). Even though
cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) has an established pro-inflammatory role, evidence suggests it is also critical to
the resolution that occurs after the initial activation phase of the immune response. In this study, we
investigated the effects of the low molecular weight fraction of 5% human serum albumin (LMWF-5A), an
agent that has proven to decrease pain and improve function in OAK patients after intra-articular in-
jection, on the expression of COX2 and its downstream products, prostaglandins (PGs).
Methods: Fibroblast-like synoviocytes from the synovial membrane of OAK patients were treated with
LMWF-5A or saline as a control with or without the addition of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) or tumor necrosis
factor α (TNFα) to elicit an inflammatory response. Cells were harvested for RNA and protein at 2, 4, 8, 12,
and 24 h, and media was collected at 24 h for analysis of secreted products. COX2 mRNA expression was
determined by qPCR, and COX2 protein expression was determined by western blot analysis. Levels of
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) in the media were quantified by competitive
ELISA.
Results: In the presence of either IL-1β or TNFα, LMWF-5A increased the expression of both COX2 mRNA
and protein, and this increase was significant compared to that observed with IL-1β- or TNFα-stimulated,
saline-treated cells. Downstream of COX2, the levels of PGE2 were increased only in TNFα-stimulated,
LMWF-5A-treated cells; however, in both IL-1β- and TNFα-stimulated cells, LMWF-5A increased the
release of the anti-inflammatory prostaglandin PGD2.
Conclusion: LMWF-5A appears to trigger increased anti-inflammatory PG signaling, and this may be a
primary component of its therapeutic mode of action in the treatment of OAK.

 1. Background
Osteoarthritis (OA), the most common form of arthritis, affects
millions of people in the US [1] and worldwide. It is associated
with symptoms of joint pain, stiffness, and swelling and risk fac-
tors of age, obesity, injury, gender, and genetic predisposition [2].
The standard treatments for OA include over-the-counter medi-
cations, such as acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs), and intra-articular injections of steroids or hya-
luronic acid [3]. This debilitating condition lessens the quality of
life of a large percent of the aging population and incurs significant
costs to society due to disability, outpatient treatments, and hos-
pitalization for joint replacement [4,5]. In addition, the prevalence
of arthritis and its associated costs are projected to rise in up-
coming years as a result of the increase in the overall age and
obesity of the world's population [6].
The knee is one of the most common joints affected by OA,
along with the hands and hips [1]. Osteoarthritis of the knee (OAK)
is physically characterized by a progressive loss of articular carti-
lage, a narrowing of the joint space, and the development of os-
teophytes [7]. The resulting and sustained mechanical stress found
in OAK drives cartilage degeneration and tissue damage, promot-
ing a chronic inflammatory environment [8,9]. Specifically, da-
maged cells release molecules called damage-associated molecular
patterns that act to promote an innate immune response and the
production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines [10]. Pro-in-
flammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and
tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), have been found in early OA le-
sions and synovial fluid [8,11]. These cytokines promote further
joint degeneration by inducing the expression of proteolytic en-
zymes, amplifying the continuous cycle of inflammation in OAK
[12].
An important target of anti-inflammatory drugs, NSAIDs in
particular, are the prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase or cy-
clooxygenase (COX) enzymes [13]. There are two isoforms of COX;
COX1 is constitutively expressed and is responsible for the reg-
ulation of normal physiological processes, while COX2 is induced
under conditions of inflammation and is thought to regulate the
inflammatory process [14]. COX enzymes catalyze the conversion
of arachidonic acid, which is liberated from cell membranes by
phospholipase A2, into prostaglandin H2 (PGH2). PGH2 then acts
as a substrate for a number of synthases and isomerases to pro-
duce a panel of eicosanoids, including prostaglandins, prostacyclin,
and thromboxane. These products can then bind to specific
membrane receptors in an autocrine or paracrine fashion. In this
manner, they exert a wide array of various and even opposing
effects. Their effects depend on a number of factors in the cellular
environment, e.g. their relative levels, the isoform of the receptor
to which they bind as well as the differential expression of the
receptors. For example, during the immune response, there is a
shift in the relative levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and pros-
taglandin D2 (PGD2), as PGE2 is increased during the initial in-
flammatory cascade for insult clearance and PGD2 is increased
during the active event of inflammatory resolution and healing
[15]. Furthermore, COX2-specific inhibitors have been shown to
inhibit both phases of the immune response and to prolong in-
flammation [16–18], revealing the importance of COX2 in healing
as well as in the initial signaling, which results in pain and
swelling.
In a recent clinical trial, pain associated with OAK was sig-
nificantly decreased with intra-articular injections of the low
molecular weight fraction of 5% human serum albumin (HSA)
under 5000 Da (LMWF-5A) [19]. HSA has been used to increase
blood plasma volume in critically ill patients for decades [20], and
the o5000 Da components of commercial HSA preparations have
been shown to inhibit the release of inflammatory cytokines,
specifically TNFα, by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
in vitro [21]. Considering that LMWF-5A decreases pain and pro-
motes mobility in OAK patients in vivo and is anti-inflammatory in
vitro, we sought to determine the effect of LMWF-5A on the COX2
pathway.
OA is induced in animal models via genetic modification, sur-
gical alteration to the joint, or intra-articular injection of agents
such as pro-inflammatory mediators [22]. LMWF-5A would likely
act as a pro-inflammatory, OA-inducing agent if injected into an-
imal models since LMWF-5A originates from a human source and
may lead to an antigenic response due to its foreign nature. Due to
this fact, in vivo characterization LMWF-5A is not feasible in ani-
mal models, and hence, the Federal Drug Administration has ex-
cluded the requirement for animal model studies of LMWF-5A
safety and efficacy. However, several clinical trials have demon-
strated safety and efficacy in humans suffering from OAK [19].
Thus, our working systems include in vitro analyses of primary
cells from patients with OAK and in vivo analyses of patient out-
comes from past and ongoing clinical trials.
LMWF-5A inhibits cytokine release in vitro [21,23], and clinical
trial results support an anti-inflammatory mode of action in vivo
[19]. The mode of action of NSAIDs is to inhibit COX2 enzymatic
function and subsequent PG production [13], thus, we hypothesize
that LMWF-5A may function by a similar mechanism. In this study,
we examined COX2 levels and prostaglandin production upon
LMWF-5A treatment in primary synovial fibroblasts isolated from
the knees of OA patients.
2. Methods
2.1. LMWF-5A production
LMWF-5A was produced at Ampio Pharmaceuticals (Engle-
wood, CO) as previously described [19]. Briefly, 5% HSA (Octa-
pharma, Hoboken, NJ) was subjected to tangential flow filtration
through a PVDF membrane with a 5000 Da molecular weight
cutoff. The o5000 Da fraction was aseptically filled into glass
vials, sealed, and stored in the dark at room temperature.
2.2. Cell culture
Human synovial fibroblasts from patients with osteoarthritis
(HSF-OA; purchased from Asterand, Detroit, MI) were maintained
in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium/Nutrient Mixture F-12
(DMEM/F12; ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) containing
20% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Before plating for experiments, the
cells were fed every two to three days with media containing 10%
FBS for two media changes and used between passage 8 and 11.
For the time course of COX2 mRNA and protein expression,
HSF-OAs (1 � 105 cells) were plated in each well of a 24-well plate
in 500 μL DMEM/F12 containing 10% FBS and incubated at 37 °C
and 5% CO2. 500 μL saline or LMWF-5A7IL-1β (R&D Systems,
Minneapolis, MN) or TNFα (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA) (final concentration of 10 ng/mL) were added, and the cells
were treated for 2, 4, 8, 12, or 24 h before harvesting for RNA and
protein. For the evaluation of prostaglandin release, HSF-OAs were
plated and treated as above. After 24 h, the media was collected,
treated if necessary (as described below), and stored frozen until
use.
2.3. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) for COX2
RNA from all time-points was isolated from the treated HSF-
OAs using the miRNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), with 1 min of
vortexing for homogenization. 0.5 μg of total RNA was then reverse

 transcribed into cDNA with the Qiagen QuantiTect kit. qPCR was
then performed in duplicate using SYBR Green I Master Mix (Roche
Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN), a RT2 qPCR primer assay for COX2
(Qiagen), and a QuantiTect primer assay for 18S rRNA (Qiagen) on
a Roche 480 Lightcycler. Relative gene expression was calculated
using the comparative threshold cycle (ΔΔCT) method versus a 0 h
untreated control, with normalization to 18S rRNA expression.
2.4. COX2 western blot analysis
HSF-OAs, as plated above, were lysed in 50 μL lysis buffer
(Qproteome Mammalian Protein kit; Qiagen) according to manu-
facturer's instructions and centrifuged at 12000 � g at 4 °C for
10 min to remove the cellular debris. Lysates from all time-points
were prepared for western blot analysis by boiling in Bolt Redu-
cing Buffer and Bolt LDS Sample Buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA). The lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE (8%) and
subjected to western blot analysis using an anti-COX2 rabbit
monoclonal primary antibody (1:1000, ab62331; Abcam, Cam-
bridge, MA) and a goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody
(1:10000, Cat# 7074P2, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA). The COX2
protein levels were normalized to α-tubulin after stripping and
reprobing with Reblot Plus (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and a horse-
radish peroxidase-conjugated α-tubulin antibody (1:5000, DM1A,
Cat# 12351S, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), respectively.
2.5. Prostaglandin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs)
Conditioned media for the two prostaglandin assays used in
this study was harvested from the same well, split into two and
processed as necessary for either PGE2 or PGD2 analysis. The le-
vels of PGE2 in the media were analyzed using a competitive
Prostaglandin E2 ELISA kit (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) following the
manufacturer's protocol. The levels of PGD2 in the media were
analyzed using a competitive Prostaglandin D2-MOX EIA kit
(Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) following the manufacturer's
instructions. Notably, with this kit, the PGD2 in the sample is
stabilized upon a 30-min incubation at 60 °C with a methylox-
imating reagent immediately following sample collection.
2.6. IL-1β ELISA
Cell culture media was collected from OA synovial fibroblast
cultures 24 h after stimulation with 10 ng/mL IL-1β in the presence
of saline or LMWF-5A and diluted to fall within the range of the
standard curve. IL-1β was quantified by sandwich ELISA (Abcam,
Cambridge, MA).
2.7. Statistical analysis
All graphs and figures represent four independent experiments
with the exception of Supplemental Fig. 1, which represents three
independent experiments. Graphs represent the mean7standard
deviation (SD). SAS (Statistical Analysis System) 9.3 software (SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used for the statistical analysis;
p-values were calculated using a student's paired two-tailed t-test,
and po0.05 was accepted as significant.
3. Results
3.1. LMWF-5A increases COX2 in cytokine-stimulated OA synovial
fibroblasts
Using primary synovial fibroblasts isolated from the knee sy-
novial membrane of patients with OA, we tested our hypothesis,
that one of the mechanisms of action of LMWF-5A is similar to
that of NSAIDs, by quantifying COX2 mRNA by qPCR and COX2
protein by western blotting over a 24 h time course. HSF-OAs in-
cubated with LMWF-5A without cytokine showed an increase in
COX2 mRNA of 3 to 13-fold when normalized back to untreated
controls over a 24 h time course (Fig. 1A; po0.05 for LMWF-5A at
2, 4, and 8 h). HSF-OAs treated with saline and then stimulated
with IL-1β or TNFα showed an induction in COX2 mRNA of 19 to
327-fold when normalized back to untreated cells over a 24 h time
period (Fig. 1B and C). Surprisingly, over the same time course,
HSF-OAs stimulated with IL-1β or TNFα induced COX2 mRNA ex-
pression 52 to 692-fold, an additional �1.2 to �4.0-fold higher, in
the presence of LMWF-5A (Fig. 1B and C; po0.05 for LMWF-
5AþIL-1β at 8, 12, and 24 h and LMWF-5AþTNFα at 2, 4, 8, 12, and
24 h). Interestingly, when COX2 protein was measured by western
blot, significant fold increases in COX2 protein were only observed
when OA synovial fibroblasts were stimulated with either IL-1β or
TNFα in the presence of LMWF-5A (Fig. 2). There was no difference
in COX2 protein without IL-1β or TNFα exposure in OA synovial
fibroblasts treated with either LMWF-5A or saline in contrast to
the observed COX2 mRNA dynamics (Fig. 2A). However, IL-1β-sti-
mulated, LMWF-5A-treated cells displayed significantly higher
levels of COX2 protein between 8 and 24 h (Fig. 2B; po0.05 for
LMWF-5A þ IL-1β at 8, 12, and 24 h). When stimulated with TNFα
in the presence of LMWF-5A, COX2 protein was significantly in-
creased over TNFα-stimulated, saline-treated HSF-OAs at 12 h
(Fig. 2C; po0.05 for LMWF-5AþTNFα at 12 h). Thus, in OA sy-
novial fibroblasts, both COX2 mRNA and COX2 protein significantly

course. OA synovial fibroblasts were cultured in the presence of LMWF-5A or saline
alone (A), LMWF-5A or saline with 10 ng/mL IL-1β (B), or LMWF-5A or saline with
10 ng/mL TNFα (C) for up to 24 h. Total RNA was harvested 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h post-
treatment, and qPCR was performed to quantify the total COX2 mRNA and 18 S
rRNA expression. Using the ΔΔCT method, relative fold changes were quantified
and normalized to untreated OA synovial fibroblasts. The normalized fold-change
(mean7SD) is shown. n indicates significantly increased COX2 mRNA when com-
pared to the saline control at that time point (po0.05; n¼4).

 increase only when these cells are stimulated with IL-1β or TNFα
in the presence of LMWF-5A.
3.2. LMWF-5A increases prostaglandin release from cytokine-sti-
mulated OA synovial fibroblasts
Considering that COX2 expression is increased under in-
flammatory conditions in the presence of LMWF-5A, we next in-
vestigated downstream products of COX2 in this system. We fo-
cused on two products, PGE2 and PGD2. PGE2 has been implicated
in the initial phase of the innate immune response, the clearance
of the insult, as well as in the promotion of tissue regeneration
[24]. PGD2 has been linked to the second phase, resolution and
healing [15]. As described above, OA synovial fibroblasts were
treated with saline as a control or LMWF-5A with or without IL-1β
or TNFα. The amount of each prostaglandin secreted into the
media was determined with a specific competitive ELISA after 24 h
of treatment (Fig. 3).
The level of PGE2 in the media of cells treated solely with saline
or LMWF-5A was below the limit of detection (LOD) of this assay
(39.1 pg/mL); however, when stimulated with cytokine, OA synovial
fibroblasts produced detectable levels of PGE2. Upon treatment with
Fig. 2. LMWF-5A increases COX2 protein in OA synovial fibroblasts when co-stimulated with pro-inflammatory cytokines. Western blots of protein lysates from OA synovial
fibroblasts were probed with antibodies against COX2 and the loading control α-Tubulin (A, C, E). Relative band densities were graphed over time (B, D, F). OA synovial
fibroblasts were left unstimulated (A, B), stimulated with 10 ng/mL IL-1β (C, D), or 10 ng/mL TNFα (E, F) in the presence of saline or LMWF-5A over a 24 h time course, and
protein lysates were prepared at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h. The normalized COX2 protein level (mean7SD) is shown. The multiple bands observed with COX2 immunoblotting
may be due to the multiple glycosylation states of COX2 [33]. n indicates significantly increased COX2 mRNA when compared to the saline control at that time point (po0.05;
n¼4).

 IL-1β or TNFα for 24 h under saline conditions, the media contained
231,000 pg/mL and 26,300 pg/mL of PGE2, respectively (Fig. 3A).
When the cells were stimulated with IL-1β in the presence of
LMWF-5A, the concentration of PGE2 in the media (251,000 pg/mL)
was not significantly different from that found in the media of IL-1β-
stimulated cells in the presence of saline (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the
level of PGE2 in the media of TNF-stimulated, LMWF-5A-treated
cells was increased by 58% (41,500 pg/mL, po0.05) compared to
that found in the media of TNF-stimulated, saline-treated cells
(Fig. 3A).
Similar to PGE2, unstimulated OA synovial fibroblasts exhibited
no detectable release of PGD2 (LOD¼2 pg/mL). Upon addition of
IL-1β or TNFα to saline-treated cells, the concentration of PGD2 in
the media increased to 189 pg/mL and 26.1 pg/mL, respectively
(Fig. 3B). Interestingly, under these conditions, LMWF-5A sig-
nificantly increased the release of PGD2 to 261 pg/mL with IL-1β
stimulation and 52.4 pg/ml with TNFα stimulation, signifying 38%
and 101% increases, respectively, (po0.05, Fig. 3B). It is important
to note that PGE2 is a stable molecule, while PGD2 is unstable and
must be chemically modified to prevent its degradation. Thus, in
this experiment, the level of PGE2 reflects the accumulation of
PGE2 over the 24 h time course, and the level of PGD2 represents a
snapshot of the PGD2 release at the time of sample collection.
4. Discussion
HSA has been used for fluid resuscitation and, more recently,
for chronic liver and renal failure [20], and the fraction of 5% HSA
under 5000 Da, LMWF-5A, has been shown to inhibit the release
of inflammatory cytokines [21,23]. Clinical trials, in which the ef-
ficacy and safety of LMWF-5A as a treatment for osteoarthritis of
the knee were tested, have shown that injection of LMWF-5A into
the knee joint improves function and decreases pain in osteoar-
thritic knees, implicating an anti-inflammatory mode of action
in vivo [19]. Other anti-inflammatory drugs, such as NSAIDs, have
long been used to treat pain and swelling in osteoarthritis [3].
Thus, we postulated that LMWF-5A may have a mechanism of
action that is similar to that of NSAIDs, i.e., blocking the enzymatic
function of COX2 and the subsequent downstream production of
PGs [13]. In this study, we tested this hypothesis with primary
human OA synovial fibroblasts, allowing us to address one of the
relevant cell types within the osteoarthritic knee. Here we report
that unexpectedly, LMWF-5A super-induces COX2 when HSF-OAs
are stimulated with either IL-1β or TNFα. We also observed a more
pronounced response in IL-1β-stimulated, LMWF-5A-treated HSF-
OAs as compared to TNFα-stimulated, LMWF-5A-treated cells.
Several cytokines and chemokines, including IL-1β and TNFα, have
been implicated in the progression of OA; however, important
differences exist between IL-1β and TNFα with respect to OA. In-
creased IL-1β levels are found in OA sera compared to normal sera
[25], and synovial membrane and cartilage samples from patients
with OA show higher levels of IL-1β-converting enzyme, which is
required to process the precursor form of IL-1β into mature cyto-
kine [26]. In a mouse model of arthritis, IL-1 blockade prevents
further disease progression, whereas inhibition of TNFα only de-
creases inflammation within the joint [27]. TNFα is significantly
increased in OA synovial fluid when compared to normal synovial
fluid but is absent in OA sera [25]. Our observed differences in the
effects of IL-1β versus TNFα stimulation in the presence of LMWF-
5A were pronounced with respect to COX2. Induction of COX2 in
IL-1β-stimulated, LMWF-5A-treated cells was much higher com-
pared
to TNFα-stimulated,
LMWF-5A-treated
cells;
however,
quantification of PGE2 release from IL-1β-stimulated cells in the
presence of LMWF-5A showed no significant difference. It was
only under TNFα-stimulated, LMWF-5A-treated conditions that a
significant increase in PGE2 was observed. It is important to note
that the relative levels of PGE2 were 10-fold higher under IL-1β-
stimulated conditions.
Considering that COX2 expression and PGE2 production are
either the same or increased with LMWF-5A under pro-in-
flammatory cytokine conditions, one may expect that LMWF-5A
injection into the OA knee would elicit a localized inflammatory
response. Eliciting an inflammatory response as a treatment has
been coined as prolotherapy, which is characterized by redness,
swelling, and pain following injections of prolotherapeutics, such
as hypertonic dextrose and morrhuate sodium [28]. The premise of
prolotherapy is to elicit an inflammatory response that acts to
trigger resolution and healing signaling cascades. Based on clinical
trial data, LMWF-5A does not cause a localized inflammatory

fibroblasts. Cell culture media was collected from OA synovial fibroblast cultures
24 h after stimulation with either 10 ng/mL IL-1β or TNFα in the presence of saline
or LMWF-5A. PGE2 (A) and PGD2 (B) were quantified by competitive ELISA. The
mean concentration7SD for four independent experiments were graphed, and n
indicates a significant increase (po0.05) in PG in the media when compared to the
corresponding saline control.

 response in vivo, as patients do not experience joint swelling but
do experience rapid pain relief that persists 12 weeks post-injec-
tion [19]. Additional evidence that LMWF-5A does not elicit an
acute inflammatory response is that PBMCs stimulated with lipo-
polysaccharide release significantly less TNFα into the medium
when co-treated with LMWF-5A [21], and treatment of HSF-OAs
with LMWF-5A and either IL-1β or TNFα does not increase IL-1β
release into the media (Supplemental Fig. 1).
Because we do not observe hallmarks of an acute inflammatory
response either in vivo or in vitro, LMWF-5A may circumvent this
response and directly initiate healing and regeneration in the
knee. Recent evidence has shown that inhibiting PGE2 degrada-
tion, thus increasing the tissue PGE2 concentration, potentiates
multi-tissue regeneration and increases hematopoiesis and bone
marrow stem cell fitness [24]. Fibroblasts found in the synovial
fluid are closely related to bone marrow stem cells [29] and may
be a source of resident stem cells within the knee. Previously, we
have shown that LMWF-5A drives chondrocyte condensation in
human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) [30], and inhibition of
COX2 disrupts hMSC chondrogenesis [31]. Thus, injection of
LMWF-5A may influence multiple cell populations within the
knee, synoviocytes, resident stem cells, and chondrocytes, to re-
generate damaged cartilage through upregulation of COX2 and
PGE2. Furthermore, we observed a significant increase in PGD2
release from LMWF-5A-treated HSF-OAs under IL-1β and TNFα
conditions. Increased PGD2 may trigger an anti-inflammatory/pro-
resolution cascade, as it spontaneously undergoes non-enzymatic
dehydration and is converted into 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin
J2 (15d-PGJ2), a cyclopentenone PG that has been shown to be
immuno-modulatory and anti-inflammatory by its ability to in-
hibit NFκB signaling and cytokine release and to act as an agonist
of PPARɣ [32]. We attempted to measure 15d-PGJ2 using a com-
mercially available competitive ELISA but found that LMWF-5A
interfered with quantification, resulting in artificially increased
values. Nonetheless, our data clearly shows that LMWF-5A sig-
nificantly
increases
anti-inflammatory
PGD2
release.
Since
increased release of PGs may be a key aspect of the therapeutic
action of LMWF-5A and because NSAIDs inhibit the production of
all subclasses of PGs due to the inhibition of upstream COX2 en-
zymatic action, these results have influenced a current clinical trial
evaluating LMWF-5A, resulting in the exclusion of NSAID use by
trial participants (NCT02556710).
5. Conclusion
In summary, we propose a mechanism in which LMWF-5A in-
creases the level of COX2 and its downstream PGs in an in-
flammatory environment, promoting resolution of inflammation
and healing as well as cartilage regeneration (Fig. 4). Because PGE2
and other PGs act in both paracrine and autocrine fashions, these
molecules can be produced by one cell type in the knee but exert
their effects on another. Our data provide important insight into
the effect of LMWF-5A on HSF-OAs; however, several other cell
populations reside within the knee and influence the overall in-
flammatory status and disease progression. We are currently ex-
ploring the regulation of COX2 and PG release in response to
LMWF-5A in several other relevant cell types and their combina-
tion to gain an understanding of their interplay in the OA knee
environment.

Fig. 4. Proposed mechanism of action for LMWF-5A with respect to the COX2
pathway. In the inflammatory environment of OAK, LMWF-5A-treated synovial fi-
broblasts increase their expression of COX2 and the downstream prostaglandins
PGE2 and PGD2. Importantly, no inflammatory responses have been observed in
either OAK patients or cell culture upon intra-articular injection or treatment with
LMWF-5A. We hypothesize that LMWF-5A increases COX2 and downstream PGE2
release from synovial fibroblasts into the synovial fluid, inducing regeneration of
cartilage, as they have been implicated in promoting chondrogenesis and tissue
regeneration. Furthermore, we have previously shown that LMWF-5A increases
chondrocyte condensation in stem cells. Additionally, increased PGD2 release from
synovial fibroblasts observed upon LMWF-5A treatment may trigger resolution of
inflammation and healing via NF-κB inhibition and PPARγ activation.
