Poxviruses continue to cause serious diseases even after eradication of the historically
deadly infectious human disease, smallpox. Poxviruses are currently being developed
as vaccine vectors and cancer therapeutic agents. Resveratrol is a natural polyphenol
stilbenoid found in plants that has been shown to inhibit or enhance replication of a
number of viruses, but the effect of resveratrol on poxvirus replication is unknown. In
the present study, we found that resveratrol dramatically suppressed the replication
of vaccinia virus (VACV), the prototypic member of poxviruses, in various cell types.
Resveratrol also significantly reduced the replication of monkeypox virus, a zoonotic
virus that is endemic in Western and Central Africa and causes human mortality. The
inhibitory effect of resveratrol on poxviruses is independent of VACV N1 protein, a
potential resveratrol binding target. Further experiments demonstrated that resveratrol
had little effect on VACV early gene expression, while it suppressed VACV DNA
synthesis, and subsequently post-replicative gene expression.

INTRODUCTION
Smallpox is a deadly disease, responsible for approximately 300 million human deaths in the 20th
century alone. Smallpox is caused by the variola virus, the most notorious member of the family
Poxviridae (Miller et al., 2001). Despite the eradication of smallpox 37 years ago, poxviruses are
of renewed interest due to their continuous impact on public health. Specifically, many poxviruses
cause other human and animal diseases. For example, monkeypox, a zoonotic disease endemic
in Central and Western Africa, caused an outbreak in humans in the United States (US) in 2003
(Reed et al., 2004; Bayer-Garner, 2005). Molluscum contagiosum accounts for 1 in 500 outpatient
visits per year in the United States (Reynolds et al., 2009). Additionally, there is a concern that
variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, can potentially be used as a biological weapon from
unsecured stocks or genetic engineering. Humans are particularly vulnerable to smallpox in the
post-smallpox immunization era due to the absence of routine vaccination, waning immunity, and
lower proportion of vaccinated individuals in the current population. In fact, between 1980 and
2010, the monkeypox incidence in Central Africa has increased 20 times after the discontinuation
of smallpox immunization (Rimoin et al., 2010). In addition, poxviruses are developed as vectors
for vaccine development against infectious diseases and as anti-cancer agents (Rerks-Ngarm et al.,
2009; Draper and Heeney, 2010; Breitbach et al., 2011; Altenburg et al., 2014; Izzi et al., 2014).
There are no FDA-approved drugs for poxvirus-infection treatment. Cidofovir, a drug for human
cytomegalovirus infection, is an off-label drug to treat poxvirus infection (Robbins et al., 2005;

Suppression of Poxvirus Replication by Resveratrol
Lu et al., 2011; Dower et al., 2012). There were also a number
of small-molecule inhibitors of poxviruses identified in the
past years, for example, CMX001, Tecovirimat (ST-246), and
CMLDBU6128 (Quenelle et al., 2007; Huggins et al., 2009; Jordan
et al., 2009). However, resistant viruses to the compounds were
isolated in cell culture, including CMX001 and ST-246 (Yang
et al., 2005; Andrei et al., 2006; Farlow et al., 2010). A combination
therapy may be required to treat infected individuals, which
demands the identification and characterization of additional
poxvirus inhibitors.
Resveratrol is a natural polyphenol stilbenoid found in grapes,
berries, and a number of other plants. Extensive studies have
been carried out to investigate its functions in modulating
lifespan, metabolism, cancer, and other diseases (Fremont, 2000).
Resveratrol inhibits replication of a number of viruses, such
as influenza virus, herpes simplex virus, enterovirus, hepatitis
C virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human immunodeficiency
virus, varicella zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, African swine
fever virus, and duck enteritis virus (Docherty et al., 1999, 2006;
Palamara et al., 2005; Nakamura et al., 2010; Galindo et al.,
2011; Espinoza et al., 2012; Xie et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2013;
Abba et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015). The antiviral mechanisms
of resveratrol against these viral infections are diverse and
include inhibition of viral protein synthesis, DNA synthesis,
and modulation of host functions important for viral infection
(Abba et al., 2015). In contrast to the above-mentioned viruses,
resveratrol facilitates Kaposi’s-sarcoma associated herpesvirus
(KSHV) reactivation from latency in several cell lines through
enhancing mitochondrial function of infected cells (Yogev
et al., 2014). Nevertheless, the effect of resveratrol on poxvirus
replication has not been examined. A previous study showed
that several polyphenols, including resveratrol, directly bind to
and may inhibit vaccinia virus (VACV, the prototypic member
of poxviruses)-encoded N1 protein, a cellular apoptotic regulator
(Cheltsov et al., 2010). However, N1L is a non-essential gene
and deletion of N1L from VACV genome does not affect VACV
infection in cultured cells (Bartlett et al., 2002). Therefore, it is
unlikely that resveratrol can prevent VACV infection through N1
protein in cell culture.
Here, we demonstrated that resveratrol could strongly
suppress VACV replication in multiple cell types. We also
showed that resveratrol directly targeted VACV DNA synthesis
step and the suppression was independent of the viral N1
protein. Resveratrol also suppressed monkeypox virus (MPXV)
replication.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Culture
BS-C-1 cells (ATCC-CCL26) were cultured in Eagle’s Minimum
Essential Medium (EMEM). HeLa cells (ATCC-CCL2) were
cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM).
Normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs, ATCC PCS-201-010)
and human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs, kindly provided by Dr.
Bernard Moss) were also cultured in DMEM. The EMEM and
DMEM were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS),
L-glutamine (2 mM), streptomycin (100 µg/mL), and penicillin
(100 units/mL). Cells were cultured in an incubator with 5% CO2
at 37◦C.
Cell Viability Assay and Calculation of
50% Cytotoxicity Concentration (CC50)
HeLa cells and HFFs were cultured in 12-well plates. The
cells were treated with DMSO or resveratrol at a series
of concentrations. Cell viability was measured using trypan-
blue exclusion test (Strober, 2015). After 24 h of treatment,
cells in each well were treated with 300 µL of trypsin and
resuspended with 500 µL of DMEM by pipetting. Twenty
microliters of cell suspension was gently mixed with 20 µL
of 4% trypan blue. The numbers of cells were measured
with a hemocytometer. The CC50 was calculated using relative
cell viability at different resveratrol concentrations by linear
regression analysis.
Viruses, Viral Infection, and Titration
Vaccinia virus Western Reserve (WR, ATCC VR-1354) strain was
amplified and purified as described previously (Earl et al., 2001a).
Recombinant N1L-deleted VACV was generated by homologous
recombination and the N1L gene was replaced with a green
fluorescent protein (GFP) gene. Briefly, PCR product of GFP
coding sequence under a late P11 promoter flanked by 500-
bp homologous sequences upstream and downstream N1L gene
was transfected into VACV-infected HeLa cells. The transfected
cells were collected at 24 h post-infection (hpi). Recombinant
viruses expressing GFP were clonally purified by multiple rounds
of plaque isolation (Earl et al., 2001b). Recombinant VACV
with the correct insertion or deletion was verified by PCR.
The recombinant VACV that expresses GFP under a synthetic
early/late VACV promoter (Chakrabarti et al., 1997) and dsRED
under P11 VACV promoter was generated using a similar
procedure. Recombinant virus vP11-Fluc that expresses firefly
luciferase gene under the late VACV P11 promoter was described
elsewhere (Bengali et al., 2011). MPXV MPXV-WA 2003-044
and MPXV-ROC 2003-358 clades were utilized in this study.
Preparation, infection, and titration of VACV and MPXV were
carried out as described previously (Earl et al., 2001a). For
infection, cells were incubated with desired amount of viruses
in DMEM (containing 2.5% FBS). After 1 h of incubation at
37◦C in 5% CO2, virus-containing DMEM was replaced with
fresh DMEM (containing 2.5% FBS) and further incubated for
desired amount of time. For titration, BS-C-1 cells cultured in
6- or 12-well plates were infected with serial diluted viral samples
and incubated in DMEM (containing 2.5% FBS and 0.5% methyl
cellulose) for 48 h. The cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet
for 5 min and washed with water before counting the number of
plaques.
Measurement and Calculation of 50%
Inhibiting Concentration (IC50)
HeLa cells or HFFs were cultured in 12-well plates. The cells
were infected with VACV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI)
of 1 in the presence of DMSO or resveratrol at a series of

concentrations. After 24 hpi, virus titers were measured by a
plaque assay. The IC50 was calculated using virus inhibitory
efficiency at different resveratrol concentrations by linear
regression analysis.
Antibodies and Chemical Inhibitors
Antibodies against VACV L2 protein, P4a (A10) protein,
and whole VACV viral particle were kindly provided by Dr.
Bernard Moss. Antibody against human GAPDH was purchased
from Abcam (Cambridge, MA, United States). Chemicals
cytosine-1-β-D-arabinofuranoside
(AraC),
resveratrol,
and
hydroxyurea were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO,
United States).
Western Blotting Analysis
Cells were collected and lysed in NP-40 cell lysis buffer (150 mM
NaCl, 1% NP-40, 50 mM Tris–Cl, pH 8.0). Cell lysates were
reduced by 100 mM DTT and denatured by sodium dodecyl
sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) loading
buffer and boiling for 3 min before SDS–PAGE, followed
by transferring to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The
membrane was then blocked in TBS-Tween (TBST) [50 mM
Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20] containing
5% skim milk and 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, incubated
with primary antibody in the same TBST-milk buffer for 1 h,
washed with TBST three times for 10 min each time, incubated
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for
1 h, washed three times with TBST, and developed with
chemiluminescent substrate (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA,
United States). The whole procedure was carried out at room
temperature. Antibodies were stripped from the membrane by
Restore (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States)
for western blot analysis using another antibody.
Luciferase Assay
Firefly luciferase activities were measured by an ENSPIRE plate
reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, United States) using the
Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI, United States)
according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Plasmid Replication in VACV-Infected
Cells
Total DNA was isolated using E.Z.N.A.
R
� Blood DNA Kit (Omega
Bio-Tek, Inc., Norcross, GA, United States). One microgram
of DNA was treated with a DpnI enzyme to digest originally
transfected input plasmid DNA (amplified from Escherichia coli,
with methylation on DpnI recognition site) but not the plasmid
DNA amplified in mammalian cells (no methylation in DpnI
site). The plasmid DNA amounts were then measured using
qPCR using a pair of primers that amplify a fragment containing
a DpnI site.
Quantitative Real-Time PCR
Total DNA was extracted from mock- or VACV-infected cells at
indicated time points using E.Z.N.A.
R
� Blood DNA Kit. Relative
viral DNA levels were quantified by CFX96 real-time PCR
instrument (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, United States) with All-in-
oneTM 2× qPCR mix (GeneCopoeia) and primers specific for
VACV and human genomes, respectively. The qPCR program
was started with initial denaturation step at 95◦C for 3 min,
followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95◦C for 10 s, annealing
and reading fluorescence at 52◦C for 30 s, and extension at 72◦C
for 30 s. The primers used in this study are:

RESULTS
Resveratrol Suppresses VACV
Replication in Immortal and Primary
Human Cells
To test the effect of resveratrol on the viability, HeLa cells,
an immortal cervical cancer cell line (Scherer et al., 1953),
were treated at a series of concentrations. Cell viability assay
showed that resveratrol caused 50% HeLa cell death (CC50)
at the concentrations of 157.75 µM in 24 h (Figure 1A and
Table 1). Consistent with the result, no significant morphological
change was observed for HeLa cells at the concentration of
50 µM (Figure 1B). We then examined the effect of resveratrol
on VACV replication. HeLa cells were infected with VACV at
an MOI of 1 in the presence of a series of concentrations
of resveratrol and the viral titers were measured 24 hpi. The
concentration of resveratrol that resulted in 50% inhibition (IC50)
of VACV replication was 4.72 µM (Figure 1C and Table 1).
Resveratrol reduced virus yield by more than 120-fold at the
concentration of 50 µM (Figure 1C). The inhibitory effect
of VACV replication by resveratrol is comparable to a well-
characterized VACV inhibitor, hydroxyurea, which is known
to prevent VACV DNA synthesis and decreased virus yield by
approximately 200-fold at the concentration of 10 mM under the
same infection conditions (Figure 1D). We examined the effect of
resveratrol on multiple rounds of VACV replication by infecting
HeLa cells at a low MOI of 0.01 and measuring the viral yield
at different times post VACV infection. We observed significant
reduction of viral titers in resveratrol-treated cells started from
8 hpi (Figure 1E), again demonstrating that resveratrol severely

impaired the replication of VACV in HeLa cells. Moreover, the
addition of resveratrol at 24 hpi still reduced VACV replication
by 250-fold when the initial MOI is low (0.001) (Figure 1F),
suggesting a possible use of resveratrol to prevent viral spreading
post infection.
The effect of resveratrol on VACV replication in primary
human cells such as
HFFs
was
also
tested.
The
CC50
concentration of resveratrol on HFF was 176.88 µM (Figure 2A
and Table 1). In fact, at the concentration of up to 100 µM,
resveratrol did not affect the morphology of HFFs (Figure 2B).
The IC50 concentration of resveratrol in HFFs was 3.51 µM
and the virus yield of VACV from 50 µM resveratrol-treated
HFFs was reduced by approximately 200-fold at an MOI of 1
(Figure 2C and Table 1). Moreover, treatment of HFFs with
100 µM of resveratrol protected the HFFs from VACV infection-
induced cytopathic effects of the cells (Figure 2D). In addition,
resveratrol also reduced the replication of VACV in another
primary human cell type, NHDF (not shown). Taken together,
our results demonstrate that resveratrol dramatically reduces
VACV replication in different human cell types.
Resveratrol Suppresses MPXV
Replication
We examined the effect of resveratrol on MPXV replication.
HeLa cells were infected with MPXV-WA and MPXV-ROC,
respectively, at an MOI of 1 in the presence of a series of
concentrations of resveratrol and the viral titers were measured
24 hpi. As shown in Figures 3A,B, 50 µM resveratrol reduced
the virus yield of MPXV-WA and MPXV-ROC clades by 195- and
38-fold, respectively. The IC50 was 12.41 µM for WA strain and
15.23 µM for ROC strain (Table 2). The inhibitory effect of
MPXV replication by resveratrol was comparable to the well-
characterized orthopoxvirus (OPXV) inhibitor, AraC, in the
corresponding parallel experiments (Figure 3).
Resveratrol Suppresses N1L-Deleted
VACV Replication
N1L encodes a viral virulence factor that is expressed at early
stage of VACV gene expression and regulates host cell apoptosis
(Bartlett et al., 2002; Yang et al., 2010). It has been reported that
some polyphenols, including resveratrol, could directly bind to
and may inhibit the function of N1 protein (Cheltsov et al., 2010).
The authors further speculated that resveratrol might inhibit
VACV replication by targeting the N1 protein. However, the
effect of resveratrol on VACV replication was not tested in the
aforementioned study. Moreover, the N1L is not an essential
VACV gene and the deletion of N1L from VACV genome was

Suppression of Poxvirus Replication by Resveratrol
FIGURE 2 | Resveratrol suppresses VACV replication in HFFs. (A) HFFs were treated with DMSO or resveratrol at the indicated concentrations for 24 h. Cell viability
was measured using trypan blue exclusion test. (B) DMSO- or resveratrol-treated cells were imaged under the bright field of a microscope. (C) HFFs were infected

not shown to affect VACV replication in cultured cells (Bartlett
et al., 2002). Based on these facts, we reasoned that prevention of
VACV replication by resveratrol is not through the N1 protein.
To test it, we replaced the N1L gene with a GFP gene in the
VACV genome through homologous recombination (Figure 4A).
Consistent with a previous observation (Bartlett et al., 2002), the
deletion of N1L did not affect VACV replication and viral yields
(Figure 4B). As expected, resveratrol similarly suppressed VACV-
Del-N1L virus (Figure 4C), indicating that inhibitory effect is not
mediated through the N1 protein.
Resveratrol Suppresses VACV Late, But
Not Early Gene Expression
To investigate the stage of viral life cycle targeted by resveratrol,
we examined the effect of resveratrol treatment on VACV protein
expression by Western blot analysis (Figure 5A). Anti-VACV
serum was derived from rabbits immunized with purified VACV
particles that comprise mostly viral structural proteins expressed
at the late stage of VACV gene expression. P4a is a major
viral core protein encoded by the VACV late gene A10L (Yang
et al., 2011). L2 protein is involved in VACV morphogenesis
and is expressed at the early stage of VACV gene expression
(Yang et al., 2010; Maruri-Avidal et al., 2011a,b). DNA synthesis
inhibitor AraC was used as a positive control. Western blots with
anti-VACV serum and P4a antibodies demonstrated dramatic
reduction in protein levels in the presence of resveratrol and
at levels comparable to the AraC treatment. In contrast, both
resveratrol and AraC treatments did not affect the expression
level of the viral early protein L2 (Figure 5A). We also used
a recombinant VACV that expressed GFP under an early/late
VACV promoter and dsRED under a late VACV promoter to
confirm suppression of late protein synthesis by resveratrol. HeLa
cells infected with recombinant VACV expressing fluorescent
proteins at an MOI of 1 in the presence of resveratrol, AraC,
or vehicle control DMSO were observed under a fluorescent
microscope. The results clearly showed that both resveratrol and
AraC completely blocked dsRED expression that was expressed
at the late stage of gene expression, while they only partially
suppressed GFP expression at similar levels that could also be
expressed at the early stage of VACV replication (Figure 5B).
These results indicate that resveratrol has little or only moderate
effect on VACV replication prior to viral early gene expression
but affects a replication step between the early and late stages of
gene expression.
The third approach we employed to examine the effect
of resveratrol on VACV late gene expression was using a
combination of hydroxyurea and resveratrol. Hydroxyurea
blocks VACV DNA synthesis but not early gene expression
(Katz et al., 1974). In the control experiment, hydroxyurea
and resveratrol were confirmed for their inhibitory effects on
expression of VACV late promoter-controlled firefly luciferase
gene of vP11-Fluc in HeLa cells (Figure 5C). In the parallel
experiment, HeLa cells were infected with vP11-Fluc for 3 h in the

presence of hydroxyurea, which allowed early gene expression.
The hydroxyurea was washed away and DMSO or resveratrol
was added and incubated for an additional 3 h. As can be seen,
resveratrol still reduced luciferase activity while DMSO could not
(Figure 5C).
Together, these results indicated that resveratrol affected a
post-replication step after VACV early gene expression.
Resveratrol Interferes VACV DNA
Synthesis
The effect of resveratrol on VACV DNA synthesis was
investigated since it is essential for post-replicative gene
expression (intermediate and late protein synthesis). VACV DNA
synthesis starts between 2 and 4 hpi in infected HeLa cells
under the conditions used in this study (Yang et al., 2010). We
examined VACV DNA amounts in VACV-infected HeLa cells at
1 and 24 hpi using quantitative real-time PCR (AraC was used as
positive control). Our results indicated that resveratrol treatment
significantly reduced VACV DNA amount at 24 hpi (Figure 6A).
The VACV DNA was 237-fold higher in DMSO-treated cells,
while the viral DNA amounts only increased 35- and 6-fold in
resveratrol- and AraC-treated cells, respectively (Figure 6A).
We tested the direct inhibitory effect on DNA synthesis by
resveratrol through examining plasmid DNA synthesis in VACV-
infected cells as circular DNA can be replicated in VACV-infected
cells that require all known viral proteins needed for VACV DNA
synthesis (DeLange and McFadden, 1986; De Silva and Moss,
2005). We transfected pUC19 plasmid into HeLa cells for 12 h
and then infected with VACV or mock-infected in the presence
or absence of resveratrol and AraC. Total DNA was isolated from
cells at 24 hpi and treated with DpnI that only digests methylated
input DNA. The DNA was then measured using specific primers
amplifying a pUC19 fragment containing the DpnI digestion
site. Dpn-resistant plasmid DNA increased 12-fold in VACV-
infected cells compared to DMSO treatment. However, there was
only a 2- to 3-fold increase of DpnI-resistant plasmid DNA in
VACV-infected cells treated with resveratrol or AraC treatment
(Figure 6B). This result indicated that resveratrol could interfere
viral DNA synthesis directly in VACV-infected cells.
DISCUSSION
Our study, for the first time, demonstrated a strong suppressive
effect of resveratrol on poxvirus replication. Similar to other
viruses, VACV replication is generally divided into entry, gene
expression, genome replication, viral particle assembly, and exit
steps. VACV gene expression is programmed as a cascade to
express viral genes at early, intermediate, and late stages (Moss,
2013a). The early gene expression starts immediately after VACV
enters into the infected cells, as the viral infectious particles
package all the factors and enzymes needed for early viral mRNA
synthesis. The viral early gene products include those necessary
factors for viral DNA synthesis. The VACV DNA synthesis
is required for viral intermediate, and subsequently, late gene
expression. The intermediate and late gene products comprise
most of the structural proteins to build infectious viral particles
(Moss, 2013a). Our study indicates that the resveratrol directly
targets viral DNA synthesis step to prevent VACV replication.
Genome uncoating is a step needed to expose encapsidated viral
DNA as a template for DNA synthesis. Because resveratrol does
not block synthesis of viral early proteins and the viral genome
uncoating factor D5 is an early protein (Kilcher et al., 2014),

Suppression of Poxvirus Replication by Resveratrol
FIGURE 4 | Resveratrol suppresses N1L-deleted VACV replication. (A) Deletion of N1L gene from recombinant virus was confirmed by PCR with two pairs of primer
specific for C11R gene (positive control) and N1L gene, respectively. (B) HeLa cells were infected with wild type and N1L-deleted VACV at an MOI of 1. Virus growth
was determined by a plaque assay. (C) HeLa cells were infected with N1L-deleted VACV at an MOI of 1 in the presence or absence of resveratrol (50 µM). Virus
titers were determined by a plaque assay at 24 hpi. The asterisk indicates significant difference (P < 0.05). The error bar indicates standard deviation.
FIGURE 5 | Resveratrol suppresses VACV late, but not early gene expression. (A) HeLa cells were infected with VACV at an MOI of 1 in the presence of DMSO,
AraC (40 µg/mL), or resveratrol (50 µM). At 24 hpi, the expression of viral proteins in infected cells was detected by western blotting using the indicated antibodies.
(B) HeLa cells were infected with a recombinant VACV carrying a GFP gene under an early/late VACV promoter and a dsRED gene under a late VACV promoter at an
MOI of 1 in the presence of DMSO, AraC (40 µg/mL), or resveratrol (50 µM). The expression of GFP and dsRED was observed and imaged using a fluorescent
microscope. (C) HeLa cells were infected with VACV-P11-Fluc at an MOI of 1 and treated with hydroxyurea (HU, 10 mM) from 0 to 3 hpi. Then
hydroxyurea-containing medium was washed away and replaced with cell culture medium containing DMSO or resveratrol (50 µM), and further incubated for
another 3 h until luciferase activity in the infected cell lysates was measured. Luciferase activities from infected cells treated with only DMSO, hydroxyurea, or
resveratrol through 0–6 hpi were also measured. The asterisk indicates significant difference (P < 0.05) between control and treated cells. The ns indicates no
significant difference. The error bar indicates standard deviation.
FIGURE 6 | Resveratrol suppresses VACV DNA synthesis. (A) HeLa cells were infected with VACV at an MOI of 1 in the presence of DMSO, AraC (40 µg/mL), or
resveratrol (50 µM). Relative viral DNA levels in infected cells were determined by real-time PCR at 1 and 24 hpi. The viral DNA level at 24 hpi was determined as the
fold to the viral DNA level at 1 hpi. (B) HeLa cells were transfected with 200 ng of pUC19 plasmid and incubated overnight. The cells were then infected with VACV
at an MOI of 5 or mock-infected in the presence of AraC, resveratrol, or DMSO. Total DNA was extracted from the cells at 24 hpi and 1 µg of total DNA was
digested with DpnI at 37◦C for 2 h followed by real-time qPCR using primers amplifying pUC19 fragment containing DpnI digestion site. The asterisk indicates
significant difference (P < 0.05) and the ns indicates no significant difference between 1 and 24 hpi. The error bar indicates standard deviation.

Suppression of Poxvirus Replication by Resveratrol
it is unlikely that resveratrol can prevent poxvirus genome
uncoating. However, we do not completely rule out the possibility
that resveratrol interferes poxvirus genome uncoating to some
extent. Interestingly, the effect is independent of the non-essential
viral N1L gene, albeit resveratrol has been suggested to be an
inhibitor of the VACV N1 protein (Cheltsov et al., 2010).
As the prototypic member of poxvirus family, VACV
has a linear, double-stranded DNA genome that replicates
entirely in the cytoplasm (Moss, 2013a). The size of the
genome is approximately 200 kbp. Although the molecular
mechanism involved in VACV DNA synthesis is not fully
understood, it is known that the VACV genome encodes
most proteins required for replicating its DNA genome (Moss,
2013b). These proteins include a DNA polymerase encoded
by E9L gene (Jones and Moss, 1984; Traktman et al., 1984),
a helicase–primase encoded by D5R (Roseman and Hruby,
1987), a processivity factor encoded by A20R (McDonald
et al., 1997), a uracil DNA glycosylase encoded by D4R
(Upton et al., 1993), and a few other proteins bearing
different roles in copying the viral DNA (Moss, 2013b). It
has been shown that resveratrol inhibits multiple mammalian
DNA polymerases including polymerase alpha through its 4-
hydroxystyryl moiety, subsequently suppressing active DNA
synthesis (Locatelli et al., 2005). As VACV DNA polymerase
has considerable similarity to human polymerase alpha (Wang
et al., 1989), it is highly possible that resveratrol interferes
with VACV DNA polymerase activity directly. Resveratrol
also modulates numerous cellular functions (Fremont, 2000);
therefore, it is possible that resveratrol affects a cellular function
that is important for VACV genome replication. However, the
role of cellular functions in VACV DNA synthesis is poorly
understood; thus, it is difficult to have an educated prediction
of a specific cellular function that may be involved in this
process.
All steps of VACV replication, from viral entry and exit,
may be targeted for antiviral drug development. For example,
mitoxantrone blocks VACV replication by targeting the virion
assembly step (Deng et al., 2007). However, the viral DNA
synthesis is one of the major targets for anti-poxvirus drug
development. Several compounds that are used to treat poxvirus
infection target the viral DNA synthesis step. Cidofovir, an
acyclic nucleoside that is approved to treat cytomegalovirus
infection in AIDS patients also exhibits anti-poxvirus activity
by targeting DNA synthesis (Andrei and Snoeck, 2010). The
widely used poxvirus inhibitors, AraC, hydroxyurea, and a
recently identified inhibitor, CMX001, also target VACV DNA
synthesis (Quenelle et al., 2007). The identification of resveratrol
as a VACV DNA synthesis inhibitor may allow for developing
alternative or compensative strategies to better manage current
and re-emergent poxvirus infections and complications caused
by poxviruses-based therapeutics.
CONCLUSION
We showed that resveratrol, a member of natural plant
polyphenols that is under extensive investigation of its effects
on many biological processes, dramatically reduced VACV and
MPXV replication. The suppression appears to affect the viral
DNA synthesis step. The results will prompt further investigation
of its effect on other poxvirus replication steps as well as the
mechanism to inhibit VACV replication.
