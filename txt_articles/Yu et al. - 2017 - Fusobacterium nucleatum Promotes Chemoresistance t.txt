SUMMARY
Gut microbiota are linked to chronic inflammation and carcinogenesis. Chemotherapy failure is 
the major cause of recurrence and poor prognosis in colorectal cancer patients. Here, we 
investigated the contribution of gut microbiota to chemoresistance in patients with colorectal 
cancer. We found that Fusobacterium (F.) nucleatum was abundant in colorectal cancer tissues in 
patients with recurrence post chemotherapy, and was associated with patient clinicopathological 
characterisitcs. Furthermore, our bioinformatic and functional studies demonstrated that F. 
nucleatum promoted colorectal cancer resistance to chemotherapy. Mechanistically, F. nucleatum 
targeted TLR4 and MYD88 innate immune signaling and specific microRNAs to activate the 
autophagy pathway and alter colorectal cancer chemotherapeutic response. Thus, F. nucleatum 
orchestrates a molecular network of the Toll-like receptor, micro-RNAs, and autophagy to 
clinically, biologically, and mechanistically control colorectal cancer chemoresistance. Measuring 
and targeting F. nucleatum and its associated pathway will yield valuable insight into clinical 
management and may ameliorate colorectal cancer patient outcomes.

 Reducing a specific gut microbe in colorectal cancer patients may improve their response to 
chemotherapy and reduce cancer recurrence.
INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the second leading cause of 
cancer-related death worldwide (Cartwright, 2012; Siegel et al., 2013). In advanced CRC 
patients, the purpose of chemotherapy is to shrink tumor size, reduce tumor growth, and 
inhibit tumor metastasis. In general, active cytotoxic drugs, including 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 
and capecitabine, inhibit the enzyme activity of thymidylate synthase during DNA 
replication (Walko and Lindley, 2005). Oxaliplatin, another chemotherapy drug, inhibits 
tumor cell growth and causes cell G2 phase arrest by covalently binding DNA and forming 
platinum-DNA adducts (Kelland, 2007). The combination of these chemotherapeutic agents 
is widely used in the treatment of CRCs (Cartwright, 2012). The majority of patients with 
advanced CRC are initially responsive to the combined chemotherapy. However, the patients 
eventually experience tumor recurrence due to drug resistance, and the 5 year survival rate is 
lower than 10% in advanced CRC patients (Dahan et al., 2009). Unfortunately, colon cancer 
patients are generally not responsive to novel immune checkpoint therapy (Zou et al., 2016). 
Thus, it is of paramount importance to elucidate the mechanism of chemotherapy resistance 
in CRC patients.
Cancer chemoresistance results from a complex interplay between gene regulation and the 
environment. The microbiota is linked to CRC initiation and progression via affecting 
intestinal inflammation (Arthur et al., 2012; Garrett, 2015; Man et al., 2015; Zitvogel et al., 
2015) and tumor-related signaling pathways (Schwabe and Jobin, 2013). Recent mouse 
studies have shown that the gut microbiota may modulate local immune responses and in 
turn affect chemotherapy (Iida et al., 2013; Viaud et al., 2013) and immunotherapy (Sivan et 
al., 2015; Vétizou et al., 2015). Human gut microbiota are linked to inflammatory cytokine 
production (Schirmer et al., 2016). Two groups have recently shown that the abundance of F.

 nucleatum is gradually increased from normal tissues to adenoma tissues and to 
adenocarcinoma tissues in colorectal carcinogenesis (Castellarin et al., 2012; Kostic et al., 
2012). Moreover, the amount of F. nucleatum in CRC tissues is associated with shorter 
survival (Mima et al., 2016). F. nucleatum adhesin FadA may bind to the E-cadherin protein 
and promote colorectal carcinogenesis (Rubinstein et al., 2013). In addition, F. nucleatum 
lectin Fap2 may recognize the host Gal-GalNAc and help this bacterium localize abundantly 
in colon cancer epithelial cells (Abed et al., 2016). However, the potential effect of F. 
nucleatum on chemotherapy is not examined in human literature. Here, we tested whether 
and how F. nucleatum affected chemotherapy in CRC patients. We have found that the 
amount of F. nucleatum is increased in CRC patients with recurrence post-chemotherapy, 
compared with those with non-recurrence post-chemotherapy. We have demonstrated that F. 
nucleatum plays a critical role in mediating CRC chemoresistance in response to small drug 
chemotherapeutics via a selective target loss of miR-18a* and miR-4802, and activation of 
the autophagy pathway.
RESULTS
F. nucleatum Is Associated with Colorectal Cancer Recurrence and Patient Outcome
To examine the potential relationship between the gut microbiota alteration and CRC 
recurrence, we re-analyzed our previous data (Yu et al., 2015) and compared the 
pyrosequenced data by using a Roche 454 GS FLX in 16 CRC tissues from patients with 
recurrence and 15 CRC tissues without recurrence (Cohort 1, Figure 1A, Table S1). We used 
the LEfSe algorithm (Segata et al., 2011) to define the potential differential bacterium 
patterns between recurrent and non-recurrent CRC patients in Cohort 1. We found that 
Fusobacterium, Anaerosporobacter, Parvimonas, Peptostreptococcus, and Prevotella were 
enriched in recurrent CRC tissues as compared to non-recurrent CRC tissues (Figure 1B). 
Anaerosporobacter is rarely associated with human disease (Jeong et al., 2007). We further 
studied Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Parvimonas micra, 
Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. Real-time PCR showed that F. nucleatum was the most 
enriched bacterium among the four bacteria in patients with recurrent CRC (Figure S1A), 
compared with patients without recurrence. This suggests that F. nucleatum may play a role 
in CRC recurrence. F. nucleatum is the most dominant phylotype in CRC (Kostic et al., 
2012). We quantified the amount of F. nucleatum in 48 CRC tissues from patients without 
recurrence (group 1) and 44 CRC tissues from patients with recurrence (group 2) (Cohort 2, 
Table S2). In agreement with our data in Cohort 1 and previous reports (Castellarin et al., 
2012; Kostic et al., 2012), the amount of F. nucleatum in CRC tissues was higher in 
recurrent patients than that in non-recurrent patients (Figure 1C). Furthermore, there was an 
enrichment of F. nucleatum in CRC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues in both 
recurrence and non-recurrence groups (Figure 1C). CRC recurrence is attributed to 
chemoresistance. Thus, F. nucleatum correlates with CRC recurrence. The high amount of F. 
nucleatum may potentially promote CRC chemoresistance.
We next evaluated the relationship between the amount of F. nucleatum and different 
clinicopathological features in Cohort 2. The amount of F. nucleatum was positively 
associated with the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage and tumor size

 (Figure S1B). A high amount of F. nucleatum was strongly associated with shorter 
recurrence free survival (RFS) (Figure 1D). The five-year recurrence survival was 
substantially shorter in the F. nucleatum-high group than the F. nucleatum-low group. 
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted to predict the 
potential CRC recurrence using either AJCC stage or the amount of F. nucleatum (Figure 
1E, Table S3). We observed that the area under curve (AUC) of F. nucleatum-based 
prediction was higher than that of the AJCC-stage based model (0.776 versus 0.646, p = 
0.039). Youden Index was used to determine the optimal cutoff point and −10.3 [−deltaCT 
value] was selected based on the abundance of F. nucleatum that provided the best balance 
between the sensitivity and the specificity to predict CRC recurrence (Table S3). In addition, 
univariate (Figure 1F) and multivariate (Figure 1G) regression analyses of Cohort 2 
demonstrated that the amount of F. nucleatum was an independent predictor of CRC 
aggressiveness with significant hazard ratios for predicting clinical outcome. Its predictive 
value was comparable to that of the AJCC stage. Thus, the data in Cohort 2 not only confirm 
our observation in Cohort 1 but also define the potential value of the amount of F. nucleatum 
in predicting CRC recurrence.
To further validate if F. nucleatum had a similar prediction value in cancer recurrence in a 
different and large patient population, we analyzed an additional cohort with 173 patients 
(Cohort 3, Table S4). The samples in Cohort 3 were classified into high and low-risk subsets 
according to the cut-off value (−10.3[−deltaCT value]) of F. nucleatum abundance derived 
from Cohort 2 (Table S3). We found that the recurrence rate in the high-risk group was 
significantly higher than the low-risk group (73.4% versus 30.9%, p = 2.436e-8) (Figure 
1H). Again, the amount of F. nucleatum was higher in recurrent patients than non-recurrent 
patients in Cohort 3 (Figure S1C). We confirmed that the high amount of F. nucleatum was 
associated with shorter RFS (Figure 1I). Univariate (Figure S1D) and multivariate (Figure 
S1E) Cox regression analyses in Cohort 3 revealed that the amount of F. nucleatum was an 
independent predictor of CRC aggressiveness. Our data indicate that F. nucleatum is 
pathologically and clinically associated with cancer recurrence and patient outcome.
F. nucleatum Promotes Cancer Autophagy Activation
We hypothesized that F. nucleatum was biologically involved in the development of colon 
cancer chemoresistance. To test this hypothesis, we co-cultured colon cancer cells with F. 
nucleatum, performed a RNA-seq analysis, and compared the gene expression profiles 
between the colon cancer cells co-cultured with or without F. nucleatum. Co-culture with F. 
nucleatum downregulated 992 gene expressions and upregulated 1,466 gene expressions in 
HT29 cells (adjusted p value < 0.05, raw data accessible via GEO: GSE90944) (Table S5). 
Single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) revealed that the gene sets including 
MizushimaI_Autophagosome_Formation, KEGG_Lysosome, 
KEGG_regulation_of_Autophagy, and Hallmark_apoptosis were enriched in CRC cells co-
cultured with F. nucleatum (Figure 2A). Given the role of the autophagy pathway in cellular 
survival (Song et al., 2009), our data suggest that F. nucleatum may cause autophagy 
pathway activation and potentially support cancer chemoresistance. In line with this, western 
blot analysis showed that F. nucleatum increased the expression of multiple autophagy 
signaling elements including pAMPK, pULK1, ULK1, and ATG7 in HCT116 cells and

 HT29 cells. These cells exhibited low LC3 protein cleavage level at the basal condition 
(Figures S2A and S2B). Real-time PCR confirmed that F. nucleatum affected the ULK1 and 
ATG7 mRNA levels (Figures 2B and 2C). These data suggest that F. nucleatum may drive 
autophagy activation in CRC cells. To examine this possibility, we performed autophagy 
functional assays in CRC cells co-cultured with F. nucleatum. Increased LC3-II and 
decreased p62 expression was detected in the F. nucleatum-co-cultured HCT116 cells 
(Figure 2D) and HT29 cells (Figure S2C) in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 
S2D). These effects were not found in the CRC cells co-cultured with P. intermedia, P. 
micra, P. anaerobius, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, or Bacteroides fragilis (Figure 
2D, Figures S2C, S2E and S2F). Furthermore, we treated HCT116 cells (Figure 2E) and 
HT29 cells (Figure S2G) with Chloroquine (CQ), an autophagy lysosomal inhibitor. 
Addition of CQ blocked the autophagic flux in the F. nucleatum-cultured cells (Figure 2E). 
We established HCT116 cells and HT29 cells that stably expressed a tandem mRFP-EGFP-
LC3 construct. We found that F. nucleatum induced the autophagic flux in HCT116 cells 
(Figure 2F) and HT29 cells (Figure 2G). In addition, autophagosomes were evaluated in 
HCT116 cells and HT29 cells co-cultured with or without F. nucleatum (Figure 2H). 
Transmission electron microscopy showed an increase in the formation of autophagic 
vesicles in the F. nucleatum-co-cultured HCT116 cells (Figure 2I) and HT29 cells (Figure 
2J). Collectively, our data indicate that F. nucleatum activates the autophagy pathway in 
CRC cells.
F. nucleatum Induces Cancer Chemoresistance via the Autophagy Pathway
We next hypothesized that F. nucleatum induced cancer chemoresistance via the autophagy 
pathway. To initially determine whether F. nucleatum induces cancer chemoresistance, 
different multiplicity of infection (MOI) of F. nucleatum was used in the co-culture with 
CRC cells. We observed that F. nucleatum (MOI = 100) had no effect on HCT116 cell and 
HT29 cell proliferation (Figures S3A and S3B). We examined the potential role of this dose 
of F. nucleatum in CRC chemoresistance. As expected, Oxaliplatin (Figure 3A) and 5-FU 
(Figure 3B) induced HCT116 cell apoptosis. Co-culture with F. nucleatum, but not with P. 
intermedia, P. micra, P. anaerobius, and medium control (Figures S3C–S3F), reduced 
HCT116 cell apoptosis induced by these chemotherapeutic agents. Moreover, F. nucleatum 
had no protective effect on HCT116 cells and HT29 cells treated with Doxorubicin (Figures 
S3G and S3H). The data indicate that F. nucleatum inuduces CRC resistance to Oxaliplatin 
and 5-FU.
SW480 cells are relatively sensitive to Oxaliplatin treatment (Moutinho et al., 2014). To 
quantitatively evaluate the potential effect of F. nucleatum on Oxaliplatin-induced SW480 
cell chemoresistance, we generated the Oxaliplatin-resistant SW480 cells from the parential 
SW480 cells by continuous exposure to gradually increased concentrations of Oxaliplatin. 
We compared Oxaliplatin-induced cell apoptosis among the parental SW480 cells, the 
Oxaliplatin-resistant SW480 cells, and the F. nucleatum-co-cultured parental SW480 cells in 
the presence of different concentrations of Oxaliplatin (Figures S3I and S3J). We found that 
109.9 μM Oxaliplatin resulted in 50%, 32.9%, and 35.5% cell apoptosis in the parental 
SW480 cells, the Oxaliplatin-resistant SW480 cells, and the F. nucleatum-co-cultured 
parental SW480 cells, respectively (Figure S3I). Given that the Oxaliplatin-resistant SW480

 cells and the F.nucleatum-cultured parental SW480 cells were similarly resistant to 
Oxaliplatin treatment, the data suggest that F. nucleatum efficiently enables chemoresistance 
to the parental SW480 cells. In further support of this possibility, the EC50 of Oxaliplatin 
was 109.9 μM, 190.9 μM, and 177.2 μM for the parental SW480 cells, the Oxaliplatin-
resistant SW480 cells, and the F.nucleatum-cultured parental SW480 cells, respectively 
(Figure S3J). In addition, we inoculated the parental SW480 cells into nude mice and treated 
the mice with different doses of Oxaliplatin with or without F. nucleatum. F. nucleatum 
alone had no effect on tumor growth (Figures S3K and S3L). As expected, tumor growth 
was significantly inhibited by both low and high doses of Oxaliplatin, and these effects were 
efficiently aborgated by F. nucleatum (Figures S3M and S3N). The data suggest that F. 
nucleatum endows potent chemoresistance to several CRC cells.
To address whether F. nucleatum modulates CRC chemoresistance via the autophagy 
pathway, we co-cultured HCT116 cells and HT29 cells with F. nucleatum and treated these 
cells with Oxaliplatin and 5-FU in the presence of CQ. We found that the F. nucleatum-
induced chemoresistant effect was abolished by CQ treatment in HCT116 cells (Figures 3A 
and 3B) and HT29 cells (Figures 3C and 3D). Moreover, western blotting showed that 
Oxaliplatin and 5-FU induced the cleavage of caspase 9, caspase 3, caspase 6, caspase 7, 
PARP, and p-H2AX, and these effects were blocked by F. nucleatum co-culture in HCT116 
cells (Figure 3E) and HT29 cells (Figure 3F). Thus, F. nucleatum may prevent CRC cells 
from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis via the autophagy pathway.
To examine whether the autophagy elements such as ULK1 and ATG7 may participate in F. 
nucleatum-induced chemoresistance in CRC cells, we analyzed LC3 cleavage status in 
ULK1 and ATG7 siRNA-transfected CRC cells cultured with F. nucleatum. As expected, 
ULK1 and ATG7 siRNAs decreased the two gene expression in CRC cells (Figures S3O and 
S3P). F. nucleatum co-culture increased the cleavage of LC3, ULK1, and ATG7 expression 
in wild-type ULK1 and ATG7 expressing CRC cells. ULK1 and ATG7 siRNAs blocked F. 
nucleatum-induced LC3 cleavage (Figures S3Q and S3R). The data indicate that F. 
nucleatum may induce autophagy activation via increasing ULK1 and ATG7 expression. 
Next, we treated CRC cells with chemotherapy agents. We found that F. nucleatum 
decreased CRC cell apoptosis in response to Oxaliplatin (Figures 3G and 3H) and 5-FU 
treatment (Figures S3S and S3T). This effect was abolished in ULK1 or ATG7-siRNA-
transfected cells (Figures 3G and 3H; Figures S3S and S3T). Thus, the data strongly suggest 
that F. nucleatum may promote CRC chemoresistance by activating the autophagy pathway, 
and the autophagy elements ULK1 and ATG7 participate in the F. nucleatum-mediated 
chemoresistance in CRC cells.
F. nucleatum Activates Cancer Autophagy via a Selective Loss of miR-18a* and miR-4802
To explore the mechanism by which F. nucleatum induced upregulation of pULK1, ULK1, 
and ATG7 at both the mRNA and protein levels, we constructed the recombination luciferase 
reporter plasmids, pGL3-ULK1p and pGL3-ATG7p, containing the promoter region of 
ULK1 or ATG7. Luciferase assay showed that F. nucleatum co-culture had no effect on 
transcriptional activity of pGL3-ULK1p and pGL3-ATG7p in CRC cells (Figures S4A and 
Yu et al.

 S4B). This suggests that F. nucleatum-increased ULK1 or ATG7 mRNA is not dependent on 
the transcriptional activation of ULK1 or ATG7 promoter.
MiRNAs often regulate gene expression by binding to the RISC complex and directing 
sequence-specific cleavage of target mRNA or repressing the target mRNA translation 
(Bartel, 2009; Krek et al., 2005). We hypothesized that dysregulated miRNAs may 
contribute to F. nucleatum-increased ULK1 and ATG7 expression. To test this hypothesis, 
we performed a global miRNA expression profiling of CRC tissues with a high amount of F. 
nucleatum from six recurrent patients, and of CRC tissues with a low amount of F. 
nucleatum from six non-recurrent patients (Cohort 1, Figure S4C, left). Sixty-eight miRNAs 
were significantly downregulated in the CRC tissues with a high amount of F. nucleatum as 
compared to that with a low amount of F. nucleatum (Figure S4C, right; Table S6). Next, we 
used the FindTar3 (http://bio.sz.tsinghua.edu.cn/) and miRDB databases (http://mirdb.org/
miRDB/) to identify potential miRNAs, which may regulate ULK1 and ATG7. After 
overlapping these potential ULK1- and ATG7-regulatory miRNAs with the identified 68 
downregulated miRNAs, we found four and three miRNAs, which may regulate ULK1 and 
ATG7, respectively (Figure S4C, right). We validated these seven miRNAs with real-time 
PCR. We found that miR-4802 and miR-18a* were the most significantly down-regulated 
miRNAs in response to F. nucleatum intervention in HCT116 cells (Figure S4D) and HT29 
cells (Figure S4E). Target prediction programs and sorting algorithm suggested potential 
specific targets for miR-18a* and miR-4802 in the seed regions within the 3′UTR regions of 
ULK1 and ATG7 genes, respectively (Figure 4A). Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated 
that miR-18a* and miR-4802 suppressed the luciferase activity in HCT116 cells (Figures 
4B–4C) and HT29 cells (Figures S4F and S4G) transfected with wild-type ULK1 and ATG7 
reporter plasmids, but not with the mutant reporter ones. Real-time PCR showed that 
miR-18a* and miR-4802 decreased ULK1 and ATG7 mRNA levels, and the mRNA 
expression levels of ULK1 and ATG7 were rescued by miR-18a* and miR-4802 inhibitors in 
HCT116 cells (Figures 4D and 4E) and HT29 cells (Figures S4H and S4I). In addition, 
western blotting revealed that overexpression of miR-18a* or miR-4802 suppressed F. 
nucleatum-induced conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and simultaneously increased p62 protein 
expression in HCT116 cells (Figures 4F and 4G) and HT29 cells (Figures S4J and S4K). 
Accumulation of autophagosomes was reduced in miR-18a* and miR-4802 overexpressing 
HCT116 cells (Figures 4H and 4I) and HT29 cells (Figures S4L and S4M) co-cultured with 
F. nucleatum, compared to controls. Thus, the data indicate that F. nucleatum activates 
cancer autophagy via a selective loss of miR-18a* and miR-4802.
MiR-18a* and miR-4802 Regulate F. nucleatum-Mediated Chemoresistance
The selective loss of miR-18a* and miR-4802 expression in F. nucleatum-cultured cell lines 
led us to hypothesize that miR-18a* and miR-4802 may regulate F. nucleatum-mediated 
chemoresistance. To test this hypothesis, miR-18a* and miR-4802 mimics or inhibitors were 
transfected in CRC cells cultured with F. nucleatum. These microRNA mimics and 
inhibitors had no effect on CRC proliferation (Figure S5A). However, miR-18a* and 
miR-4802 mimics increased Oxaliplatin- and 5-FU-induced apoptosis in HCT116 cells 
(Figures 5A and 5B) and HT29 cells (Figures S5B and S5C) cultured with F. nucleatum, 
compared with controls. Consistent with these data, a loss-of-function study revealed that

 anti-miR-18a* and anti-miR-4802 increased chemoresistance in HCT116 cells (Figures 5C 
and 5D) and HT29 cells (Figures S5D and S5E) cultured with F. nucleatum. Western 
blotting showed that the inhibitory effects of F. nucleatum on the chemotherapy-induced 
caspase and PARP cleavage and p-H2AX were abolished by miR-18a* and miR-4802 
mimics transfection in HCT116 cells (Figure 5E) and HT29 cells (Figure S5F).
In the CRC xenograft mouse models, HCT116 cells and HT29 cells were inoculated into 
nude mice, followed by treatment with miRNAs, chemotherapeutic agents, F. nucleatum-co-
culture, and other manipulations. There was no difference in tumor weight (Figures S5G and 
S5H) and tumor growth (Figure S5I) among different control groups. Interestingly, tumor 
growth was significantly decreased by Oxaliplatin (Figures S5J–S5L) and 5-FU treatment 
(Figures S5M–S5O), and these decreases were blocked by F. nucleatum treatment in vivo. 
Thus, F. nucleatum participates in CRC chemoresistance in response to Oxaliplatin and 5-
FU therapy. Furthermore, F. nucleatum-induced CRC chemoresistance was rescued by CQ, 
an autophagy pathway inhibitor (Figures S5J–S5O). In addition, F. nucleatum-induced CRC 
chemoresistance was reversed by miR-18* and miR-4802 adenovirus transduction in tumor 
bearing mouse models treated with Oxaliplatin (Figures 5F–5H) or 5-FU (Figures S6A–
S6C). Overexpression of ULK1 and ATG7 blocked miR-18a* and miR-4802-mediated 
reversion of F. nucleatum-stimulated chemoresistance in tumor tissues (Figures 5F–5H, 
Figures S6A–S6C). Furthermore, western blotting confirmed that miR-18a* and miR-4802 
rescued the inhibitory effects of F. nucleatum on the apoptotic gene expression (Figure 
S6D), tumor apoptosis (Figure 5I, Figure S6E), and auto-phagosome formation (Figures 5J 
and 5K, Figures S6F and S6G) in response to chemotherapy. These data support that 
miR-18a* and miR-4802 regulate F. nucleatum-mediated chemoresistance by blocking F. 
nucleatum-induced autophagy activation.
TLR4 and MYD88 Pathway Is Involved in F. nucleatum-Mediated Chemoresistance
The TLR4 and MYD88 innate immune signaling pathway is activated in response to F. 
nucleatum intervention (Abreu and Peek, 2014; Liu et al., 2007). In line with this, we found 
that the levels of TLR4 and MYD88 transcripts (Figures S7A and S7B) and proteins 
(Figures S7C and S7D) were enhanced in response to F. nucleatum treatment in HCT116 
cells and HT29 CRC cells. To examine whether the TLR4 and MYD88 pathway participated 
in F. nucleatum-induced autophagy activation, we transfected CRC cells with TLR4 and 
MYD88 siRNA and co-cultured the cells with F. nucleatum. Western blotting showed that F. 
nucleatum-mediated autophagy activation was reduced in TLR4 or MYD88 siRNA-
transfected CRC cells (Figures S7C and S7D). Knockdown of TLR4 or MYD88 expression 
blocked F. nucleatum-induced ULK1 and ATG7 upregulation, F. nucleatum-induced 
miRNA-18a* and miRNA-4802 loss, and F. nucleatum-induced chemoresistance in HCT116 
cells (Figures 6A–6F) and HT29 cells (Figures 6G–6L). Furthermore, F. nucleatum-induced 
CRC chemoresistance was rescued by knocking down TLR4 or MYD88 in the CRC 
xenograft mouse model, as shown by reduced tumor weight (Figures 6M and 6N, Figures 
S7E and S7F) and tumor volume (Figure 6O, Figure S7G). The data indicate that F. 
nucleatum-induced loss of miRNA-18a* and miRNA-4802, F. nucleatum-activated 
autophagy pathway, and F. nucleatum–mediated chemoreistance are dependent on the TLR4 
and MYD88 signaling pathway.

 The Levels of F. nucleatum, MicroRNAs, and Autophagy Components Correlate and Are 
Clinically Relevant in CRC Patients
To investigate clinical significance of F. nucleatum, microRNAs (miR-18a* and miR-4802), 
and autophagy components (ULK1 and ATG7) in CRC patients, we studied CRC tissues and 
normal colorectal tissues adjacent to cancer lesions in Cohort 2. We quantified F. nucleatum 
and the expression of miR-18a* and miR-4802 with real-time PCR and detected the protein 
expression of pULK1, ULK1, and ATG7 by immunohistochemistry in CRC tissues and 
normal tissues. We found that the high amount of F. nucleatum, the high expression of p-
ULK1, ULK1, and ATG7, and the low levels of miR18a* and miR-4802 expression were 
more likely detected in patients with recurrence, compared with patients without recurrence 
(Figures 7A–7C). The amount of F. nucleatum in CRC tissues negatively correlated with the 
levels of miR-18a* and miR-4802 and positively correlated with ULK1 and ATG7 
expression (Figure 7D). The data demonstrate that the amount of F. nucleatum and the 
expression levels of miR-18a* and miR-4802 positively and negatively correlate with 
autophagy pathway activation status, respectively. Altogether, we reason that F. nucleatum 
may act on CRC via TLR4 and MYD88, cause a selective loss of miR-18a* and miR-4802 
expression, subsequently result in autophagy activation, and consequently promote 
chemoresistance in patients with colorectal cancer (Figure 7E).
DISCUSSION
Capecitabine (and 5-FU) in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy has been 
widely used to treat different types of cancer including CRC (Kelland, 2007). Although CRC 
patients’ initial responses to surgical debulking and chemotherapy is often effective, relapse 
with drug-resistant cancer usually occurs and patients succumb to disease (Bertotti and 
Sassi, 2015; Jemal et al., 2009). Unfortunately, CRC patients are generally not responsive to 
novel immune checkpoint therapy (Zou et al., 2016). Conventional chemotherapy remains 
the first line therapy for patients with CRC. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of 
chemoresistance in CRC is essential to optimizing current therapeutic strategies.
Cancer genetic and epigenetic alterations in CRC chemotherapeutic response have been 
extensively reported (Bardelli and Siena, 2010; Dallas et al., 2009; Esteller, 2008; Linardou 
et al., 2008; Van Geelen et al., 2004; Weichert et al., 2008). Recent mouse studies have 
shown that the gut microbiota may modulate local immune responses and in turn affect 
chemotherapy (Iida et al., 2013; Viaud et al., 2013) and immunotherapy (Sivan et al., 2015; 
Vétizou et al., 2015). Human studies demonstrate that the adaptive immune system can also 
regulate chemosensitivity of human ovarian cancer (Wang et al., 2016). However, the 
potential role of the gut microbiota in CRC chemoresistance is poorly understood. Through 
a combination of genomic, bioinformatic, biological, in vivo models and clinical studies, we 
have demonstrated that autophagy-related pathways are enriched and activated in CRC 
patients with a high amount of F. nucleatum, and that F. nucleatum promotes CRC 
chemoresistance.
Metagenomic and transcriptomic analyses have revealed that intestinal microbes, especially 
F. nucleatum, are involved in CRC development (Castellarin et al., 2012; Kostic et al., 2012).

 carcinogenesis via the fusobacterial adhesin FadA(Rubinstein et al., 2013). The interaction 
between a host polysaccharide, Gal-GalNAc with fusobacterial lectin (Fap2) facilitates F. 
nucleatum enrichment in CRC tissues (Abed et al., 2016). However, it is unknown whether 
and how F. nucleatum may mediate chemoresistance in CRC. We report that F. nucleatum 
induces LC3-II expression, autophagic flux, and autophagosome synthesis in CRC cells. 
Accordingly, F. nucleatum stimulates expression of the autophagy-related proteins, pULK1, 
ULK1, and ATG7 in CRC, and biochemical and genetic autophagy inhibition enhances the 
sensitivity of F. nucleatum-treated CRC cells to 5-FU and Oxaliplatin. Thus, we conclude 
that autophagy contributes to F. nucleatum-mediated CRC resistance to Oxaliplatin and 5-
FU regimens. Our data may explain why CRC patients with a high amount of F. nucleatum 
experience poor outcomes (Mima et al., 2016).
We have dissected the mechanisms by which F. nucleatum mediates the ULK1 and ATG7 
pathway activation. F. nucleatum does not affect the transcription of ULK1 and ATG7. It has 
been reported that adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC) may regulate human intestinal epithelial 
cell autophagy via modulating the expression of miR-30C and miR-130A (Nguyen et al., 
2014). Our bioinformatic and functional studies have elucidated that miR-18a* and 
miR-4802 target ULK1 and ATG7, respectively, and are selectively lost due to F. nucleatum 
co-culture, and can biologically modulate CRC chemoresistance in vitro and in vivo. Thus, 
F. nucleatum medicates chemoresistance via selectively targeting specific miRNAs and 
autophagy elements. Given that the TLR4 and MYD88 innate immune signaling pathway is 
essential for F. nucleatum infection (Abreu and Peek, 2014; Liu et al., 2007), we have 
demonstrated that F.nucleatum-induced genomic loss of miR-18a* and miR-4802 depends 
on the TLR4 and MYD88 signaling pathway. Therefore, F. nucleatum orchestrates the 
TLR4-MYD88, miR18a* and miR4802, and ULK1/ATG7 autophagy network to 
biologically control CRC chemoresistance (Figure 7E).
In addition to its biological importance, our work may be relevant in clinical management of 
CRC patients. As the amount of F. nucleatum is associated with the risk of CRC recurrence, 
the measurement of F. nucleatum post-surgery may be an effective approach to predict 
patient outcome. Furthermore, our data raise an important clinical question: are conventional 
chemotherapeutic regimens including Capecitabine plus Oxaliplatin suitable for CRC 
patients with a high amount of F. nucleatum? Alternatively, we suggest that CRC patients 
with a high amount of F. nucleatum may be treated with conventional chemotherapy in 
combination with anti-F. nucleatum treatment and/or an autophagy inhibitor. Thus, it is 
important to detect F. nucleatum and its associated pathway and differentially manage 
patients with different levels of F. nucleatum.

 EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Mice—For the xenograft experiments, four-week-old male BALB/c nude mice were housed 
in laminar flow cabinets under specific pathogen-free conditions with food and water 
provided ad libitum. Colorectal cancer cells (1 × 107 SW480-male cells or 5 × 106 HCT116-
male cells) were injected subcutaneously into the right axilla of each mouse to establish the 
CRC xenograft model. Six days after subcutaneous inoculation, mice were randomly divided 
into different groups for different sets of experiments. The relevant viral vectors and F. 
nucleatum were given by multipoint intratumoral injection, twice per week for three weeks. 
Chemotherapeutic agents and CQ were administered by intraperitoneal injection, twice per 
week for three weeks.
To explore the role of F. nucleatum in chemoresistance in Oxaliplatin-sensitive tumor in 
vivo, we used SW480-male cells (1×107) in the xenograft experiments. There were six 
groups: i) Saline (Control); ii) F. nucleatum bacteria solution; iii) low-dose Oxaliplatin (5 
mg/kg); iv) low-dose Oxaliplatin (5 mg/kg) and F. nucleatum; v) high-dose Oxaliplatin (10 
mg/kg); vi) high-dose Oxaliplatin(10 mg/kg) and F. nucleatum. Mice received intratumoral 
injection with F. nucleatum, and intraperitoneal injection with Oxaliplatin twice a week for 
three weeks.
In the following experiments, we used HCT116-male cells (5 × 106) to establish the 
xenograft models, and CQ (30 mg/kg), Oxaliplatin (7.5 mg/kg), and 5-FU (50 mg/kg) to 
treat the mice.
To explore the role of F. nucleatum, miRNAs, and autophagy in CRC chemoresistance in 
vivo, we used HCT116-male cells (5 × 106) in the xenograft experiments. There were eight 
groups: i) saline (Control); ii) F. nucleatum bacteria solution; iii) miRNA vector virus; iv) 
miR-18a* virus; v) miR-4802 virus; vi) control virus; vii) ATG7 overexpression virus; and 
viii) ULK1 overexpression virus.
To explore the role of autophagy in F. nucleatum-mediated chemoresistance in vivo, we 
designed seven groups: i) Control group; ii) F. nucleatum group; iii) CQ group; iv) 
Oxaliplatin (or 5-FU) group; v) Oxaliplatin (or 5-FU) and F. nucleatum group; vi) 
Oxaliplatin (or 5-FU) and CQ group; vii) Oxaliplatin (or 5-FU), F. nucleatum and CQ group.
To explore the role of specific miRNAs and autophagy elements in F. nucleatum-mediated 
chemoresistance in vivo, we designed seven groups: i) Control group; ii) Oxaliplatin (or 5-
FU) group; iii) Oxaliplatin (or 5-FU) and F. nucleatum group; iv) Oxaliplatin (or 5-FU), F. 
nucleatum and miR-18a* virus group; v) Oxaliplatin (or 5-FU), F. nucleatum and miR-4802 
virus group; vi) Oxaliplatin (or 5-FU), F. nucleatum, miR-18a* virus and ULK1 
overexpression virus group; vii) Oxaliplatin (or 5-FU), F. nucleatum, miR-4802 virus and 
ATG7 overexpression virus group.
To explore the role of the TLR4 signaling pathway in F. nucleatum-mediated 
chemoresistance in vivo, we designed eight groups: i) Control group; ii) control shRNA 
group; iii) TLR4 shRNA virus group; iv) MYD88 shRNA virus group; v) Oxaliplatin (or 5-
FU) group; vi) Oxaliplatin (or 5-FU) and F. nucleatum group; vii) Oxaliplatin (or 5-FU), F.

The length and width of the tumors (in millimeters) were measured every three days with 
calipers. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula (A × B2)/2, where A and B are the 
long and short dimensions, respectively. After three weeks, all mice were sacrificed and 
subcutaneous tumors were collected and weighed. The tumor volume and weight are 
presented as means ± SEM (n = 8). Mouse experiments were conducted in accordance with 
the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. 
The study procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee 
of Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University.
Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Fusobacterium nucleatum strain ATCC 
25586 (Castellarin et al., 2012), Bacteroides fragilis strain 43860, Enterococcus faecalis 
strain 47077, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius strain 27337, Parvimonas micra strain 33270, 
and Prevotella intermedia strain 49046 were purchased from American Type Culture 
Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). F. nucleatum and P. micra were cultured overnight at 
37°C under anaerobic conditions (DG250, Don Whitley Scientific, West Yorkshire, UK) in 
brain heart infusion (BHI) broth supplemented with hemin, K2HPO4, Vitamin K1, and L-
Cysteine(Rhee et al., 2009). P. anaerobius and P. intermedia were cultured in Wilkins-
Chalgren anaerobe broth (CM0643, Thermo Fisher Scientific, West Palm Beach, FL) at 
37°C under anaerobic conditions. B.fragilis was cultured overnight at 37°C under anaerobic 
conditions in ATCC 1490 Modified chopped meat medium. E. faecalis and the commensal 
Escherichia coli strain DH5α (Tiangen, China) were cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium 
overnight at 37°C in shake cultivation at 220 rpm/min.
Cell Lines—Human colorectal cancer cell lines RKO-NA, SW1116-male, DLD1-male, 
SW480-male, Caco2-male, LOVO-male, HT29-female, and HCT116-male (ATCC) were 
cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (GIBCO, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal 
bovine serum (FBS) at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Human colonic epithelial 
cell FHC (from 13 weeks gestation) was cultured in DMEM/F12 medium (GIBCO, 
Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 25mM HEPES, 10 ng/ml cholera toxin, 0.005mg/ml 
insulin, 0.005 mg/ml transferrin, 100 ng/ml hydrocortisone and 10% FBS at 37°C in a 
humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. To establish the Oxaliplatin-resistant SW480 cells, we 
cultured SW480 cells with gradually increased Oxaliplatin for two months. The EC50 of 
Oxaliplatin was 190.9 μM and 109.9 μM for the established Oxaliplatin-resistant SW480 
cells and the parental SW480 cells, respectively.
Patients and Clinical Specimens—We studied 3 cohorts of patients with colorectal 
cancer from Renji Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine 
between 2012 and 2015. Cohort 1 and cohort 2 were from the Western Campus of Renji 
Hospital. Cohort 3 was from the Eastern Campus of Renji Hospital. There were 31 fresh 
tissues in Cohort 1 and 92 and 173 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues (FFPE) in 
Cohorts 2 and 3, respectively. We performed 16 s RNA sequencing studies in Cohort 1 to 
define which bacterium is predominant (and/or different) in the recurrent colorectal cancer 
tissues compared to the non-recurrent colorectal cancer tissues. We used Cohort 2 as a

 discovery clinical sample set to determine which levels of F. nucleatum are linked to 
chemoresistance-associated cancer recurrence. We used Cohort 3 as a validation dataset to 
evaluate whether the cut-off value generated from Cohort 2 could be applied and validated in 
an independent cohort with known clinical information such as recurrent or no-recurrent 
cancer. Thus, Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 serve as the models for our research exploration, discovery, 
and validation, respectively. All the patients information could be found in Tables S1–S2 and 
S4.
Patients were pathologically and clinically diagnosed with colorectal cancer. After surgical 
debulking, patients had undergone XELOX regimen therapy (Oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 IV 
over two hours on the first day; Capecitabine 850~1000 mg/m2, twice daily p.o. for 14 days; 
repeated every three weeks). Informed consent was obtained from the patients before sample 
collection in accordance with institutional guidelines. Recurrence was monitored by imaging 
examination systems (Chest X-ray and CT), gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsy, and 
telephone follow-up. The Ethics Committees in the Renji Hospital approved the study 
protocols. Written informed consents were obtained from all participants in this study. All 
the research was carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Helsinki Declaration of 
1975.
METHOD DETAILS
High-Throughput Sequencing—For RNA sequencing, each sample was cleaned up on 
an RNeasy Mini Column (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), treated with DNase, and analyzed 
for quality on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Samples were run on an Illumina HiSeq 3000 
for 2 × 150-bp paired-end sequencing. The RNA-seq data analysis was performed according 
to the TopHat- HTSeq-DeSeq2 frame (Anders et al., 2013). Briefly, reads were mapped to 
the human genome (hg19) using TopHat v2.0.11(Kim et al., 2013) (http://
tophat.cbcb.umd.edu) with the default options with a TopHat transcript index built from 
Ensembl_GRCh37. Count files of the aligned sequencing reads were generated by the htseq-
count script from the Python package HTSeq with union mode, using the GTF annotation 
file(Anders et al., 2015). The read counts from each sequenced sample were combined into a 
count file, which was subsequently used for the differential expression analysis. Differential 
analyses were performed to the count files using DESeq2 packages, following standard 
normalization procedures(Love et al., 2014). Genes with less than 5 total counts in both 
conditions were removed from further analysis. The RNA sequence data have been 
deposited in NCBIs Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) 
and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE90944.
RNA Extraction and Real-Time PCR—Total RNA was extracted from the CRC lines 
using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and 1 μg of total RNA was reverse 
transcribed using the PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (Perfect Real Time; Takara, Japan) to 
detect relative mRNAs. For the miRNAs, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using 
All-in-One MiRNA Q-PCR Detection Kit (GeneCopoeia, Rockville, MD) according to 
manufacturer’s instructions in a total reaction volume of 25 μl. Quantitative real-time PCR 
was performed in triplicates on an Applied Biosystem 7900 quantitative PCR system 
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as previously described (Sun et al., 2015). The Ct

 values obtained from different samples were compared using the 2−ΔΔCt method. β-actin and 
U6 served as internal reference genes, respectively.
Detection of F. nucleatum—The primer sequences of the reference gene, prostaglandin 
transporter (PGT) and the method for F. nucleatum detection were described previously 
(Castellarin et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2013). gDNA was extracted from fresh colorectal 
cancer tissue with the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and from FFPE 
with QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). gDNA from each 
specimen was subjected to qPCR to determine the amounts of F. nucleatum by detecting the 
16S genes. Each reaction contained 40 ng of gDNA and was assayed in triplicate in 10 μL 
reactions containing 1 × Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 
West Palm Beach, FL),0.4 μM each primer and was placed in a 96-well optical PCR plate. 
Amplification and detection of DNA was performed with the ABI StepOne Plus Real-Time 
PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) under the following reaction conditions: 
10 min at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15 s and at 60°C for 1 
min. The cycle threshold (Ct) values for F. nucleatum were normalized to the amount of 
human biopsy gDNA in each reaction by using PGT as a reference gene (Castellarin et al., 
2012).
Western Blot and Chemical Reagents—Western blot was performed using standard 
techniques as described previously (Xiong et al., 2012). Cell extracts were collected and 
quantified using BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, West Palm Beach, FL). 
40 μg of protein was electrophoresed through 12% SDS polyacrylamide gels and were then 
transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The membranes were blocked in 
5% fat-free milk for one hour and then incubated with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight. 
Secondary antibodies were labeled with HRP (KangChen, China) and the signals were 
detected using ECL Kit (Pierce Biotech, Rockford, IL). Subsequently, the images were 
analyzed by ImageJ 1.43 software. A β-actin antibody was used as a control for whole-cell 
lysates. The information on all antibodies is listed in RESOURCES TABLE.
Cell Proliferation Assay, Apoptosis Detection, and TUNEL Assay—Cell 
proliferation was assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo, Japan) assay. Cells were seeded 
at 2000 cells/well into 96-well plates with 100 μL culture medium. The 10 μL of CCK-8 
solution was added to the cells at specific time points and cells were incubated for 2 hr at 
37°C. The reaction product was quantified according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Apoptosis was examined by flow cytometric analysis. An Annexin V FITC/PI double stain 
assay (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) was performed following the manufacturer’s 
protocol. When the cells were treated with Doxorubicin, we performed FVS510 and 
Annexin V-FITC double staining to avoid the fluorescent signal of the drug. Tumor cell 
apoptosis in the xenograft tumor tissues was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl 
transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) technology using the in Situ Cell 
Death Detection Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). The negative 
control was incubated with label solution (without terminal transferase) instead of the 
TUNEL reaction mixture.

 Oligonucleotide Transfection—siRNAs, miRNA mimics, and inhibitors were purchased 
from Genepharma (Shanghai, China) (Table S7). Oligonucleotide transfection was 
performed using the DharmaFECT 1 siRNA transfection reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 
while nonspecific siRNA or miRNA was used as negative controls.
Luciferase Assay—HCT116 cells or HT29 cells were co-transfected with 80 ng of the 
luciferase reporter plasmid, 10 ng of the pRL-TK-Renilla-luciferase plasmid (Promega, 
Madison, WI), and the indicated RNAs (final concentration of 20 nmol/L). Twenty-four 
hours after transfection, firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were quantified using the 
Dual-Luciferase Assay Kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Each transfection was performed in 
triplicates and repeated twice.
Electron Microscopy—Cells were treated as indicated and fixed with 2.5% 
glutaraldehyde containing 0.1 mol/L sodium cacodylate. Samples were fixed using 1% 
osmium tetroxide, followed by dehydration with an increasing concentration gradient of 
ethanol and propylene oxide. Samples were then embedded, cut into 50-nm sections, and 
stained with 3% uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Images were acquired using a JEM-1200 
electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan).
Confocal Microscope—HCT116 cells and HT29 cells were plated in 6-well plates and 
allowed to reach 50%–70% confluence at the time of transfection. MRFP-GFP-LC3 
adenoviral vectors were purchased from HanBio Technology (Shanghai, China). The 
principle of the assay is based on different pH stability of green and red fluorescent proteins. 
The fluorescent signal of EGFP could be quenched under the acidic condition (pH below 5) 
inside the lysosome, and the mRFP fluorescent signal has no significant change under the 
acidic condition. In green and red-merged images, autophagosomes are shown as yellow 
puncta (i.e., RFP+GFP+), while autolysosomes are shown as red puncta (i.e., RFP+GFP−). 
Autophagic flux is increased when both yellow and red puncta are increased in cells, while 
autophagic flux is blocked when only yellow puncta are increased without red puncta 
alteration, or when both yellow and red puncta are decreased in cells (Zhou et al., 2012).
Adenoviral infection was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. CRC cells 
were incubated in growth medium with the adenoviruses for 2 hr at 37°C, and were grown in 
medium containing F. nucleatum and miRNAs at the indicated concentrations for 0–24 h at 
37°C. LC3 puncta were examined with Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss) 
fitted with a 63 × oil immersion objective.
Adenovirus and Plasmids Construction—The control, control shRNA, control 
miRNA, miR-18a*, miR-4802, TLR4 shRNA, MYD88 shRNA adenovirus, as well as ULK1 
and ATG7 overexpression adenovirus, and all plasmids were constructed by Shanghai Obio 
Techonology Company, Shanghai, China.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSES
Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were carried out using the program R (www.r-
project.org). Data from at least three independent experiments performed in triplicates are 
presented as the means ± SE. Error bars in the scatterplots and the bar graphs represent SE.

 Data were examined to determine whether they were normally distributed with the One-
Sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. If the data were normally distributed, comparisons of 
measurement data between two groups were performed using independent sample t test and 
the comparisons among three or more groups were first performed by one-way ANOVA test. 
If the results showed significant difference, when the data were skewed distribution, 
comparisons were performed by nonparametric test. Measurement data between two groups 
were performed using nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. To generate the ROC curves, 
patients were classified as recurrence time either longer or shorter than the median 
recurrence free survival, excluding patients who were alive for durations less than the 
median recurrence free survival at last follow-up. Single-sample gene set enrichment 
analysis (ssGSEA) was used to assess gene set activation scores in gene expression profiling 
data. ssGSEA calculates a sample level gene set score by comparing the distribution of gene 
expression ranks inside and outside the gene set. The ssGSEA score was calculated by Gene 
Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) R package (Hänzelmann et al., 2013). Statistical tests were 
two-tailed and a p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Data and Software Availability—Data from this study have been deposited in the Gene 
Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases under the following accession: GSE90944.

 Figure 6. TLR4 and MYD88 Pathway Is Involved in F. nucleatum-Mediated Chemoresistance
(A–D) Real-time PCR was performed to detect ATG7 (A), ULK1 (B), miR-18a* (C), and 
miR-4802 (D) expression in HCT116 cells. HCT116 cells were co-cultured with F. 
nucleatum and transfected with TLR4 and MYD88 siRNAs, respectively.
(E and F) Apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry in HCT116 cells. The cells were co-
cultured with F. nucleatum after TLR4 and MYD88 siRNAs transfection, and subsequently 
treated with different concentrations of Oxaliplatin (E) or 5-FU (F), nonparametric Mann–
Whitney test.
