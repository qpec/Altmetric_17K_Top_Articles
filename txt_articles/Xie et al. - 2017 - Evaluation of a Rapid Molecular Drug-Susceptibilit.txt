Abstract
BACKGROUND—Fluoroquinolones and second-line injectable drugs are the backbone of 
treatment regimens for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, and resistance to these drugs defines 
extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. We assessed the accuracy of an automated, cartridge-based 
molecular assay for the detection, directly from sputum specimens, of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
with resistance to fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and isoniazid.
METHODS—We conducted a prospective diagnostic accuracy study to compare the 
investigational assay against phenotypic drug-susceptibility testing and DNA sequencing among 
adults in China and South Korea who had symptoms of tuberculosis. The Xpert MTB/RIF assay 
and sputum culture were performed. M. tuberculosis isolates underwent phenotypic drug-
susceptibility testing and DNA sequencing of the genes katG, gyrA, gyrB, and rrs and of the eis 
and inhA promoter regions.
RESULTS—Among the 308 participants who were culture-positive for M. tuberculosis, when 
phenotypic drug-susceptibility testing was used as the reference standard, the sensitivities of the 
investigational assay for detecting resistance were 83.3% for isoniazid (95% confidence interval 
[CI], 77.1 to 88.5), 88.4% for ofloxacin (95% CI, 80.2 to 94.1), 87.6% for moxifloxacin at a 
critical concentration of 0.5 μg per milliliter (95% CI, 79.0 to 93.7), 96.2% for moxifloxacin at a 
critical concentration of 2.0 μg per milliliter (95% CI, 87.0 to 99.5), 71.4% for kanamycin (95% 
CI, 56.7 to 83.4), and 70.7% for amikacin (95% CI, 54.5 to 83.9). The specificity of the assay for 
the detection of phenotypic resistance was 94.3% or greater for all drugs except moxifloxacin at a 
critical concentration of 2.0 μg per milliliter (specificity, 84.0% [95% CI, 78.9 to 88.3]). When 
DNA sequencing was used as the reference standard, the sensitivities of the investigational assay 
for detecting mutations associated with resistance were 98.1% for isoniazid (95% CI, 94.4 to 
99.6), 95.8% for fluoroquinolones (95% CI, 89.6 to 98.8), 92.7% for kanamycin (95% CI, 80.1 to 
98.5), and 96.8% for amikacin (95% CI, 83.3 to 99.9), and the specificity for all drugs was 99.6% 
(95% CI, 97.9 to 100) or greater.

 CONCLUSIONS—This investigational assay accurately detected M. tuberculosis mutations 
associated with resistance to isoniazid, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides and holds promise 
as a rapid point-of-care test to guide therapeutic decisions for patients with tuberculosis. (Funded 
by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, and the 
Ministry of Science and Technology of China; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02251327.)
Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (defined by resistance to isoniazid and rifampin) is a 
consequence of ineffective treatment, both at the individual level, when antibiotics are 
improperly selected or taken, and at the programmatic level, when the use of standard 
regimens is based on algorithms that may not include drug-susceptibility testing. Incorrect 
diagnosis and treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis is associated with morbidity, 
mortality, and ongoing transmission of infection. For uncomplicated multidrug-resistant 
tuberculosis, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently endorsed a treatment regimen 
of 9 to 12 months, as a potential alternative to conventional regimens of 18 to 24 months.1 
Fluoroquinolones and second-line injectable drugs — aminoglycosides and capreomycin — 
are core components of this shortened regimen. Rapid methods for the detection of 
susceptibility and resistance to fluoroquinolones and second-line injectable drugs are needed 
to identify patients who are microbiologically eligible for the shortened regimen. Detection 
of Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug resistance with the use of conventional culture-based 
phenotypic drug-susceptibility testing is slow and biohazardous and requires substantial 
laboratory infrastructure and training.
Xpert MTB/RIF (Cepheid) is an integrated, automated, cartridge-based system, used with 
GeneXpert instrumentation, for the rapid molecular detection of M. tuberculosis and 
mutations associated with rifampin resistance. Xpert MTB/RIF is widely used in 
tuberculosis programs and has contributed to the global increase in detection of rifampin-
resistant tuberculosis.2 However, for patients with rifampin-resistant tuberculosis, Xpert 
MTB/RIF provides no further information to guide the selection of appropriate antibiotics or 
to promptly identify and triage to equipped health care centers those patients who have 
extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (defined as multidrug-resistant tuberculosis that is 
additionally resistant to fluoroquinolones and second-line injectables). M. tuberculosis 
resistance to fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and isoniazid is associated with 
approximately 25 mutations in six genes and promoter regions.3–10 We recently described a 
new cartridge, for use with the GeneXpert platform, for the rapid molecular detection of 
these mutations.11 This assay can provide results from unprocessed sputum samples in just 
over 2 hours, with minimal hands-on technical time. Here, we describe a clinical study to 
assess the diagnostic accuracy of this investigational assay for the detection of resistance to 
fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and isoniazid.
METHODS
STUDY DESIGN AND OVERSIGHT
We conducted a blinded, multicenter, prospective diagnostic accuracy study. The 
investigational assay was the index test, and phenotypic culture-based drug-susceptibility 
testing and DNA sequencing, considered separately, were the reference standards for 
resistance detection. The primary objective of the study was to determine the sensitivity and

 specificity of the investigational assay for the detection of M. tuberculosis resistance to 
isoniazid, moxifloxacin, ofloxacin, amikacin, and kanamycin.
The study was designed, implemented, and supervised by the Tuberculosis Clinical 
Diagnostics Research Consortium (TB-CDRC), which is made up of academic investigators 
at participating sites. Members of the TB-CDRC performed statistical analyses, wrote the 
manuscript, and made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. All the authors 
vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and analyses and for the fidelity of the 
study to the protocol, which (with the statistical analysis plan) is available with the full text 
of this article at NEJM.org.
The investigational assay cartridges, Xpert MTB/RIF cartridges, and 10-color GeneXpert 
instruments were donated by Cepheid. Cepheid personnel had no role in study design, 
implementation, data analysis, manuscript writing, or the decision to submit the study 
findings for publication.
STUDY POPULATION
Adults in Seoul, South Korea, and Zhengzhou, China, who had symptoms of pulmonary 
tuberculosis were enrolled in the study. Participants were enrolled prospectively into one of 
two groups — the drug-resistance-risk group and the case-detection group. The inclusion 
and exclusion criteria for each group are provided in Table S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix, available at NEJM.org. All participants provided written informed consent. The 
ethics committees at the enrolling sites and Johns Hopkins University approved this study.
STUDY PROCEDURES
For each participant, one investigational assay and one Xpert MTB/RIF test were performed 
directly on the same sputum specimen; in addition, one smear microscopy test, one 
mycobacterial liquid culture, and one solid culture were performed after digestion and 
decontamination of sputum. Participants provided up to two expectorated sputum specimens 
1 hour to 4 days apart. If the volume of the first specimen exceeded 3.5 ml, it was 
homogenized with glass beads (Fisher Scientific) and split into two portions: 1.5 ml for the 
investigational assay and Xpert MTB/RIF and the remainder for smear and cultures. If the 
volume of the first specimen was between 1.5 and 3.5 ml, it was used for the investigational 
assay and Xpert MTB/RIF, and the second sputum specimen was used for smear and culture. 
Full details of the study design and procedures are provided in the protocol.
XPERT MTB/RIF AND INVESTIGATIONAL ASSAY
The investigational assay cartridge was assembled by Cepheid, using components 
synthesized or sourced by Cepheid. Sample reagent was added to sputum (in a 2:1 dilution), 
and 2.0 ml of the resulting mixture was added to one Xpert MTB/RIF and one 
investigational cartridge.12 Xpert MTB/RIF and investigational assays were performed with 
the use of standard four-module GeneXpert instruments. For the investigational assay, the 
instrument was calibrated to detect 10 fluorescence channels, with the use of research-
version software that enabled 10-color melting-temperature analysis. For each probe 
targeting a resistance-associated genetic region, the melting temperature or temperatures

 were determined and interpreted as wild-type, mutant (if the measured temperature was 
different from the known wild-type melting temperature), or heteroresistant (if both wild-
type and mutant melting temperatures were present).11 A specimen was considered to be 
resistant to a drug if a mutant melting temperature was detected in any of the gene targets 
associated in high frequency with resistance — namely, katG and the inhA promoter for 
isoniazid, gyrA for the fluoroquinolones ofloxacin and moxifloxacin, and rrs for kanamycin 
and amikacin.3,4,8,11,13–18 A specimen with a wild-type or uninterpretable melting 
temperature in a high-frequency gene target was considered to be susceptible or of 
indeterminate susceptibility, respectively, to the corresponding drug, unless there was a 
mutant melting temperature in the low-frequency gene target — namely, gyrB for 
fluoroquinolones and the eis promoter for kanamycin.3,4,8,11,13,15,19,20 The personnel 
performing the investigational assay were unaware of the other test results. The 
investigational assay was conducted in real time, but the results were not released to 
clinicians and therefore did not affect decisions regarding treatment.
MYCOBACTERIAL CULTURES
Sputum was digested with N-acetyl-L-cysteine and sodium hydroxide (final concentration, 
2%) and processed with the use of standard methods.21 Smear microscopy was performed 
with Ziehl–Neelsen staining on the concentrated pellet.22 A volume of 0.5 ml of the 
resuspended pellet was inoculated into liquid culture (BACTEC MGIT, BD Microbiology 
Systems), and 0.2 ml was inoculated onto Löwenstein–Jensen medium. Cultures that were 
positive for growth of acid-fast bacilli underwent confirmation of the presence of M. 
tuberculosis complex by means of paranitro-benzoic acid (PNB) and thiophen-2-carboxylic 
acid hydrazide (TCH) testing,22 MPT64 antigen detection (Capilia TB, Tauns Laboratories), 
or polymerase chain reaction (MolecuTech MTB-ID V3, YD Diagnostics).
PHENOTYPIC DRUG-SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING
Indirect drug-susceptibility testing was performed from the first positive M. tuberculosis 
culture with the use of the BACTEC MGIT 960 system. The critical concentrations used for 
each drug were 0.1 μg per milliliter for isoniazid, 0.5 and 2 μg per milliliter for 
moxifloxacin, 2 μg per milliliter for ofloxacin, 1 μg per milliliter for amikacin, and 2.5 μg 
per milliliter for kanamycin.23
DNA SEQUENCING
The molecular drug resistance of cultured isolates was characterized by Sanger DNA 
sequencing (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). DNA was prepared from the same 
culture that was used for phenotypic drug-susceptibility testing. Each of the six gene targets 
included in the assay was sequenced to detect mutations in target and nontarget regions. 
Sequencing was the reference standard for the detection of heteroresistance, defined as the 
presence, in a single sample, of both wild-type and mutant sequences for a given gene 
locus.11

 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The primary objective of the study was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the 
investigational assay for the detection of resistance to isoniazid, fluoroquinolones (ofloxacin 
and moxifloxacin), and aminoglycosides (kanamycin and amikacin). In the primary 
analyses, the reference standards for phenotypic and molecular drug-susceptibility testing 
were considered separately, and sensitivity and specificity were calculated for the detection 
of resistance to each drug.24 The main analysis population for drug-susceptibility testing, 
which was made up of participants who were culture-positive for M. tuberculosis and who 
had interpretable results of reference-standard drug-susceptibility testing, included 
participants who were prospectively enrolled into the drug-resistance-risk and case-detection 
groups. Secondary analyses of diagnostic accuracy for tuberculosis case detection included 
only participants in the case-detection group. To explore the diagnostic accuracy of the 
investigational assay for the testing of patients who are already known to have rifampin-
resistant tuberculosis, we conducted a post hoc analysis of a “reflex-test population” that 
was made up of participants who were included in the main analysis of drug-susceptibility 
testing and in whose sputum the Xpert MTB/RIF test indicated the presence of rifampin-
resistant M. tuberculosis. Reference-standard drug-susceptibility testing was performed 
independently and regardless of the investigational-assay results. Invalid or indeterminate 
investigational-assay results were enumerated but not included in sensitivity and specificity 
calculations. The binomial exact method was used to calculate 95% confidence intervals.
RESULTS
PARTICIPANTS
A total of 405 participants were enrolled in the study from June 2014 through June 2015 
(Fig. 1). Four enrolled participants produced insufficient sputum for tests and were excluded 
late in the study. Thus, 401 participants were eligible for inclusion in the study. A total of 93 
participants were excluded from the analyses of drug-susceptibility testing, including 79 for 
whom cultures were negative for M. tuberculosis, 2 for whom specimens were mislabeled, 
10 for whom M. tuberculosis DNA was of insufficient quality or quantity for sequencing, 
and 2 for whom MGIT drug-susceptibility testing cultures were contaminated. Thus, 308 
culture-positive participants were included in the main analysis population for drug-
susceptibility testing.
DISTRIBUTION OF PHENOTYPIC AND GENOTYPIC RESISTANCE
Phenotypic drug-susceptibility testing identified 194 of 308 participants (63.0%) as having 
infections that were resistant to one or more drugs, including 55 participants with multidrug-
resistant tuberculosis, 54 with tuberculosis that was multidrug-resistant in addition to being 
resistant to fluoroquinolones or aminoglycosides, and 39 with extensively drug-resistant 
tuberculosis (Table 1). DNA sequencing identified 25 different mutations among the six 
gene targets; 15 of the mutations occurred in isolates from both China and South Korea 
(Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The most common mutations were katG S315T, 
gyrA D94G, rrs A1401G, inhA C(-15)T, and gyrA A90V.

 OPERATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INVESTIGATIONAL ASSAY
The investigational assay provided no drug-susceptibility testing information for 4 of 308 
participants (1.3%) (2 had invalid results, and 2 had no M. tuberculosis detected) (Table S4 
in the Supplementary Appendix). Among the remaining 304 participants, the investigational-
assay results were indeterminate for 18 (1.0%) of 1824 total gene targets. The assay 
sensitivities for tuberculosis case detection were 96 of 98, or 98.0% (95% confidence 
interval [CI], 92.8 to 99.8), for the investigational assay and 97 of 99, or 98.0% (95% CI, 
92.9 to 99.8), for Xpert MTB/RIF.
INVESTIGATIONAL ASSAY VERSUS PHENOTYPIC DRUG-SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING
The sensitivity and specificity, respectively, of the investigational assay for the detection of 
phenotypic resistance were 83.3% and 99.2% for isoniazid, 88.4% and 96.6% for ofloxacin, 
87.6% and 94.3% for moxifloxacin at a critical concentration of 0.5 μg per milliliter, 96.2% 
and 84.0% for moxifloxacin at a critical concentration of 2.0 μg per milliliter, 71.4% and 
98.4% for kanamycin, and 70.7% and 99.6% for amikacin (Table 2). Almost all isolates that 
were found by phenotypic drug-susceptibility testing to be resistant but found by the 
investigational assay to be susceptible (i.e., to have a wild-type melting temperature) were 
also found to be wild-type by sequencing (Fig. 2A). All but one of the isolates that were 
found by phenotypic drug-susceptibility testing to be susceptible but were found by the 
investigational assay to be resistant (i.e., to have a mutant melting temperature detected) 
were found by DNA sequencing to have corresponding resistance mutations (Fig. 2B).
INVESTIGATIONAL ASSAY VERSUS DNA SEQUENCING
The sensitivity and specificity, respectively, of the investigational assay for the detection of 
resistance mutations were 98.1% and 100.0% for isoniazid, 95.8% and 100.0% for 
fluoroquinolones, 92.7% and 99.6% for kanamycin, and 96.8% and 100.0% for amikacin 
(Table 3, and Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). Among the 13 specimens that had 
mutations that were missed by the investigational assay, 10 (76.9%) were identified as 
heteroresistant by DNA sequencing. The assay successfully detected the mutant population 
in 16 of 26 (61.5%) sequencing-confirmed heteroresistant bacillary populations, the majority 
of which were found to be resistant by phenotypic drug-susceptibility testing (Table S6 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). The diagnostic accuracies of the investigational assay in the 
reflex-test analysis population are provided in Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix, and 
the diagnostic accuracies according to sputum smear microscopy status and enrollment site 
are provided in Tables S8 and S9 in the Supplementary Appendix.
IDENTIFICATION OF PATIENTS ELIGIBLE FOR THE SHORTENED TREATMENT REGIMEN
One potential use of the investigational assay would be to determine the eligibility of 
patients for a shortened treatment regimen for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Among 
patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, the investigational assay correctly identified 
48 of 53 patients (90.6%; 95% CI, 79.3 to 96.9) who had tuberculosis without phenotypic 
resistance either to fluoroquinolones or to aminoglycosides (i.e., patients who were 
microbiologically eligible for the shortened regimen) and 81 of 92 patients (88.0%; 95% CI, 
79.6 to 93.9) who had tuberculosis with phenotypic resistance to fluoroquinolones,

 aminoglycosides, or both (i.e., patients who were not microbiologically eligible for the 
shortened regimen). Accordingly, the predictive value of a positive investigational-assay 
result (resistance detected) for microbiologic unsuitability for the shortened regimen was 81 
of 86 (94.2%; 95% CI, 87.0 to 98.1). The predictive value of a negative investigational-assay 
result (no resistance detected) for microbiologic eligibility for the shortened regimen was 48 
of 59 (81.4%; 95% CI, 69.1 to 90.3).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we assessed the clinical diagnostic accuracy of a cartridge-based, automated 
assay for the rapid detection, directly from sputum specimens with the use of the GeneXpert 
platform, of M. tuberculosis mutations that are associated with resistance to isoniazid, 
fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides. This assay identified known mutations in genetic 
regions associated with resistance to these drugs with reasonable certainty; the sensitivity 
estimates were lower when phenotypic culture-based drug-susceptibility testing was used as 
the reference standard. Among patients with rifampin-resistant tuberculosis, the predictive 
value of a positive investigational-assay result for resistance to fluoroquinolones, 
aminoglycosides, or both was 94%. Although we did not test this strategy, we speculate that 
a positive test result could be used to triage patients away from the new shortened treatment 
regimen for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and toward treatment centers with the capacity 
for comprehensive drug-susceptibility testing and with experience treating highly drug-
resistant tuberculosis.
The WHO has set targets for the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of next-generation 
molecular drug-susceptibility tests, with sequencing used as the reference standard, of 95% 
and 98%, respectively.24 The investigational assay described here met the sensitivity target 
for isoniazid, fluoroquinolones, and amikacin and missed the sensitivity target for 
kanamycin by approximately 2 percentage points. The investigational assay met the 
specificity target for all tested drugs.
Not surprisingly, the sensitivity of the investigational genotypic assay to detect resistance 
was lower when culture-based phenotypic drug-susceptibility testing was considered as the 
reference comparator. Most isolates that were found to be resistant by phenotypic drug-
susceptibility testing but were found to be wild-type (and thus susceptible) by the 
investigational assay were also found to be wild-type by DNA sequencing. Our results are 
consistent with those reported in studies in which other molecular assays were used for M. 
tuberculosis drug-susceptibility testing.25–30 There are at least two potential causes of the 
phenotypic–genotypic discrepancies — alternative molecular mechanisms of resistance, 
many of which are still unknown, and limitations of the critical-concentration methods used 
for phenotypic testing, such that up to 5% of wild-type M. tuberculosis strains are 
categorized as drug-resistant.31
Phenotypic–genotypic discrepancy was the driver of the lower-than-ideal predictive value of 
a negative investigational test (no resistance detected) for microbiologic eligibility for the 
shortened regimen. If the investigational assay were used as the sole test for triaging patients 
with rifampin-resistant tuberculosis onto or away from the shorter treatment regimen for

 multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, approximately 20% of patients who have tuberculosis with 
phenotypic resistance to fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, or both would be 
inappropriately triaged to receive the shorter regimen. However, this is predicted to be a 
shortcoming of any molecular test that interrogates the set of common resistance-associated 
genetic loci targeted by the investigational assay. Currently, there are no other rapid, point-
of-care tests to facilitate evidence-based treatment selection for patients with rifampin-
resistant tuberculosis.
We identified sequencing-confirmed resistance mutations in some phenotypically 
susceptible isolates. This phenomenon was most commonly observed for fluoroquinolones, 
especially moxifloxacin, and resulted in the investigational assay having a lower specificity 
than culture when the moxifloxacin critical concentration of 2.0 μg per milliliter was used. 
This situation was almost always associated with gyrA A90V or S91P mutations, which 
confer low-level moxifloxacin resistance, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) 
of 0.25 to 1.0 μg per milliliter.16,32 Although these MICs are higher than those of wild-type 
M. tuberculosis, isolates with gyrA A90V or S91P mutations are potentially treatable with 
increased moxifloxacin dosing,33,34 and these mutations can be distinguished from other 
gyrA mutations with the use of the investigational assay.11 Heteroresistance was detected by 
the investigational assay in some phenotypically susceptible isolates. Mixed populations of 
susceptible and resistant bacilli can be clinically relevant, since the unmasking of drug 
resistance can occur during treatment.35,36 Thus, molecular diagnostics can provide 
important information for optimizing treatment that is not revealed by dichotomous results 
of critical concentration–based phenotypic drug-susceptibility testing and does not become 
available in a timely manner when agar-proportion-method testing is used.
Our study has several limitations. First, most participants with culture-confirmed 
tuberculosis had high sputum bacillary burdens, as evidenced by the high proportion of 
specimens that were found to be positive on smear microscopy; the results of our study will 
need to be confirmed in more patients with smear-negative tuberculosis and with a reference 
standard of multiple cultures. However, the completion of all tests from one sputum 
specimen for most participants minimized any potential effect of between-specimen 
heterogeneity. Second, the geographic representation of participants and M. tuberculosis 
strains was limited. However, DNA sequencing confirmed that the infecting organisms in the 
study population contained a diverse set of mutations that are prevalent in other geographic 
areas. Third, although we did not evaluate capreomycin, a cyclic peptide second-line 
injectable drug, the rrs A1401G mutation detected by the investigational assay accounts for 
the majority of capreomycin resistance when a molecular mechanism is identified.8 Finally, 
phenotypic drug-susceptibility testing was performed only at critical concentrations; MICs 
were not established, and therefore the full breadth of phenotypic–genotypic relationships 
was not assessed.
Our results compare favorably with published results for the newest versions of the 
Genotype MTBDR line probe assays (Hain Lifescience), although we did not perform 
Genotype MTBDR assays.28,30,37 The investigational assay and Genotype MTBDRsl, 
version 2.0, share most genetic targets for the detection of fluoroquinolone and 
aminoglycoside resistance.28,37 The line-probe assays, which are recommended by the

 WHO to assess candidacy for the shortened treatment regimen for multidrug-resistant 
tuberculosis, require a minimum of 4 to 6 hours before a result is obtained, which typically 
precludes same-day therapeutic decision-making; are largely confined to reference centers 
that meet laboratory-infrastructure and assay training requirements; and are inadequately 
sensitive when used to test smear-negative sputum specimens from patients with 
tuberculosis.30,38 In contrast, a result of the investigational assay can be obtained in 2 hours, 
the assay was found to preserve sensitivity when applied to smear-negative sputum, and it 
incorporates the same single-step specimen processing as the Xpert MTB/RIF, which can be 
implemented with minimal staff training and biosafety requirements.2 Existing GeneXpert 
instruments have the potential to be upgraded to run both the investigational assay and the 
Xpert MTB/RIF assay by upgrading software and performing a 10-color calibration, 
allowing both assays to be run contemporaneously with one instrument. These features 
should permit the investigational assay to be used in peripheral sectors of the global health 
care system, where more rapid identification of extended drug resistance may improve 
therapeutic decision-making.

 Figure 1. Participant Enrollment and Testing in the Main Analysis Population
Among the 12 patients who were excluded from the analysis of drug-susceptibility testing 
(DST) because of a lack of a reference-test result, 10 had DNA that was of insufficient 
quality or quantity for sequencing, and 2 had uninterpretable MGIT phenotypic DST results 
because of contamination. Complete DST reference-standard results were not achievable for 
4.3% of participants (14 of 322) whose culture was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 
Among the 308 participants in the main analysis population for DST, 152 were excluded 
from the reflex-test analysis population (146 with an Xpert MTB/RIF result indicating that 
rifampin resistance was not detected, 4 with an Xpert MTB/RIF result indicating that M.

 Figure 2. Sequencing Analysis of Isolates with Discrepant Investigational Assay and Phenotypic 
DST Results
Panel A shows the results of sequencing analysis of isolates that were found by the 
investigational assay to be susceptible (i.e., to have a wild-type melting temperature) and 
were found by phenotypic DST to be resistant. Panel B shows the results of sequencing 
analysis of isolates that were found by the investigational assay to be resistant (i.e., to have a 
mutant melting temperature detected) and were found by phenotypic DST to be susceptible. 
A full list of the genotypes found by DNA sequencing is provided in the Supplementary 
Results section in the Supplementary Appendix.

*There are no known silent mutations that occur within the gene regions tested by the investigational assay for resistance. In the study, no silent mutations in these regions were detected either by the 
investigational assay or by sequencing.
†The numbers of specimens with each combination of results for the investigational assay and DNA sequencing are shown. M+M indicates specimens found to have a mutation by both methods, M+NM 
specimens found by the investigational assay to have a mutation and found by DNA sequencing to have no mutation, NM+M specimens found by the investigational assay to have no mutation and found by

‡One specimen was excluded because of an indeterminate investigational-assay result for katG (also found indeterminate for katG by sequencing).
§Ofloxacin and moxifloxacin are grouped as fluoroquinolones, since gyrA and gyrB mutations confer resistance to both drugs. One specimen was excluded because of an indeterminate investigational-assay 
result for gyrA (no gyrA or gyrB mutation was detected by sequencing).
¶Six specimens were excluded because of an indeterminate investigational-assay result for rrs (five with no rrs mutation found by sequencing and one with an rrs mutation found by sequencing).
