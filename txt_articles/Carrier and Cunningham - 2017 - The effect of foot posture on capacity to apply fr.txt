The effect of foot posture on capacity to apply free moments to the
ground: implications for fighting performance in great apes
David R. Carrier1 and Christopher Cunningham2,*
ABSTRACT
In contrast to most other primates, great apes have feet in which the
heel supports body weight during standing, walking and running. One
possible advantage of this plantigrade foot posture is that it may
enhance fighting performance by increasing the ability to apply free
moments (i.e. force couples) to the ground. We tested this possibility
by measuring performance of human subjects when performing from
plantigrade and digitigrade (standing on the ball of the foot and toes)
postures. We found that plantigrade posture substantially increased
the capacity to apply free moments to the ground and to perform a
variety of behaviors that are likely to be important to fighting
performance in great apes. As predicted, performance in maximal
effort lateral striking and pushing was strongly correlated with free
moment magnitude. All else being equal, these results suggest
species that can adopt plantigrade posture will be able to apply larger
free moments to the ground than species restricted to digitigrade or
unguligrade foot posture. Additionally, these results are consistent
with the suggestion that selection for physical competition may have
been one of the factors that led to the evolution of the derived
plantigrade foot posture of great apes.

INTRODUCTION
Plantigrade foot posture, in which the heel contributes to support of
body weight during walking, running and standing, is a derived
character of apes (Hominoidea) (Gebo, 1992; Schmitt and Larson,
1995; D’Août et al., 2002, 2004; Vereecke et al., 2003, 2005)
(Fig. 1). Most primates walk, run, and stand with an elevated heel
that does not contact with the substrate, the so-called semi-
plantigrade posture. Walking gibbons (the lesser apes) exhibit an
intermediate foot posture in which steps begin with contact by the
metatarsal heads and this is followed by contact of the midfoot and
the heel; a posture called ‘midfoot/heel plantigrade’ (Schmitt and
Larson, 1995; Vereecke et al., 2005). However, the only study that
has measured pressure under the feet of walking gibbons found that
only one of four subjects actually loaded the heel during stepping
(Vereecke et al., 2005). In contrast, weight support by the heel is
consistently displayed by great apes (Hominidae). In great apes,
both quadrupedal and bipedal steps begin with a heel strike (Gebo,
1992; Schmitt and Larson, 1995; D’Août et al., 2002, 2004;
Vereecke et al., 2003) (Movie 1) and the heel contributes to support
of body weight throughout the first half of the step (Schmitt and
Larson, 1995; Vereecke et al., 2003). Thus, although some other
primates have independently evolved plantigrade posture, for
example spider monkeys (Schmitt and Larson, 1995), plantigrade
posture is a derived trait of the apes and is most dramatically
expressed in the great apes.
Several functional explanations for plantigrade foot posture have
been proposed. Gebo (1992) suggested that the plantigrade feet of
great apes evolved as a consequence of limits imposed on terrestrial
locomotion
by
specialization
for
suspension
climbing
and
brachiation. He argued that arms longer than the legs result in an
inclined trunk when walking on the ground and the modified
shoulder joint of great apes is less capable of supporting body
weight in a quadrupedal stance. Thus, Gebo proposed that arboreal
specialization produced a posterior shift of the body’s center of mass
and this led to contact of the heel with the ground during terrestrial
walking and running. In contrast, Schmitt and Larson (1995)
suggest that plantigrade foot posture evolved as a result of selection
to reduce forelimb loading during quadupedal progression in
species adapted for suspensory locomotion. They suggest that
plantigrade posture is tied to greater hindlimb protraction at the
beginning of a step and elevated activity of the hindlimb retractor
muscles, which act to shift the center of mass posteriorly (Reynolds,
1985a,b). This active posterior shift of the center of mass increases
reliance for weight support on the rear-hindfoot, including the heel.
Thus, Schmitt and Larson (1995) suggest that the evolution of
plantigrade foot posture is linked to a kinetic shift of the center of
mass posteriorly to unload the forelimbs for improved reaching and
grasping in an arboreal habitat (Jones, 1916; Clark, 1959; Reynolds,
1985a,b; Schmitt, 1998; Schmitt and Lemelin, 2002).
In humans, plantigrade foot posture also provides an energetic
advantage during walking (Cunningham et al., 2010) and, to a lesser
extent, during running at moderate speeds (Ogueta-Alday et al.,
2014). Relative to most other species, humans are economical
walkers (Sockol et al., 2007; Steudel-Numbers, 2003; Rubenson
et al., 2007). Humans also differ from other studied species in that
it costs substantially less to walk a given distance than to run
the same distance (Rubenson et al., 2007; Farley and McMahon,
1992; McGeer, 1990; Margaria et al., 1963). The large energetic
advantage during walking is due, in part, to a reduction in the loss of
mechanical energy associated with the directional change of the
trajectory of the center of mass during a walking step (Ruina et al.,
2005; McGeer, 1990). Plantigrade feet reduce these directional
changes and therefore decrease the loss of mechanical energy
(Adamczyk et al., 2006; Cunningham et al., 2010). Humans are
also known to have greater mechanical advantage at their limb
joints during walking than during running (Biewener et al., 2004)
and plantigrade foot posture plays an important role in this

 (Cunningham et al., 2010; Usherwood et al., 2012). Additionally,
plantigrade posture increases effective limb length of walking
humans (Webber and Raichlen, 2016). Thus, the structure of the
human foot helps to explain why humans are economical walkers,
but did plantigrade foot posture evolve in great apes to improve the
economy of walking?
There are reasons to suspect that the heel-down posture of great
apes did not evolve as a result of selection on economical
locomotion; most species of extant apes travel relatively short
distances. Daily distances traveled by orangutans, chimpanzees,
bonobos and gorillas are 0.5–0.8 km (Bean, 1999), 3–10 km
(Williams et al., 2002; Bean, 1999), 2.4 km (Williams et al., 2002;
Bean, 1999) and 0.5–2.6 km (Doran and McNeilage, 2001; Bean,
1999), respectively. However, daily foraging distances of female and
male human hunter-gatherers average 9.5 and 14.1 km, respectively
(Marlowe, 2005). Second, the energy savings associated with high
mechanical advantages at the limb joints of walking humans is a
function of both plantigrade foot posture and of the highly erect limb
posture of humans (Biewener et al., 2004; Cunningham et al., 2010;
Usherwood et al., 2012). Great apes have plantigrade feet but walk
with significantly flexed limb joints (Elftman, 1944; Sockol et al.,
2007), further reducing the potential for energy saving from
plantigrade foot posture. Thus, it seems unlikely that the evolution
of plantigrade feet was driven by selection on locomotor economy in
the last common ancestors of great apes.
Plantigrade feet may also improve performance when competing
physically (i.e. fighting) with the forelimbs from a bipedal stance; a
behavior that is common in all species of great apes (Livingstone,
1962; de Waal, 1982, 1986; Fossey, 1983; Goodall, 1986; Kano,
1992; Jablonski and Chaplin, 1993; Wrangham and Peterson, 1996;
Furuichi, 1997; Thorpe et al., 2002) (Movies 1 and 2). Although
moving rapidly from the balls of the feet is important in fighting, great
apes (including humans) frequentlystrike and grapple with their heels
in contact with the ground (Movie 1). By allowing the application of
larger free moments to the ground, plantigrade foot posture may
increase the application of force and energy when striking and
grappling with an opponent. Striking or pushing on an opponent with
the arm will result in a reaction force that tends to rotate the fighter’s
body. A competitor may be better able to strike and push with greater
force and maintain position and balance if he or she can exert larger
free moments on the ground with their feet. Free moments can be
applied to the ground through two feet or through one foot that has
two separated points of contact. Plantigrade posture may facilitate free
moment production through two mechanisms: (1) maximizing the
distance between the points of force application to the ground (i.e.
moment arm), and (2) situating the rear ground contact behind the
ankle joint. The rear ground contact in the semi-plantigrade feet of
most primates is made through the anterior tarsal bones, the cuboid,
entocuneiform and navicular (Vereecke et al., 2003). Although this
allows a somewhat longer moment arm, between ground contact
points of the anterior ankle and toes, the fact that the rear contact point
is in front of the ankle means that it may act as a pivot point of the foot
because it typically supports a greater percentage of body weight than
the toes. For these reasons, we suspect that plantigrade foot posture
will improve performance in behaviors important to success during
fighting.
The ability to adopt plantigrade foot posture appears to be basal
for mammals (Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum, 2006). Plantigrade
foot posture has been retained in some mammalian lineages (e.g.
rodents), lost in some, and re-evolved in others (e.g. bears and great
apes). Thus, the ability to apply free moments to the substrate during
both locomotor and non-locomotor behaviors could be important to
the evolution of foot posture in multiple mammalian lineages. Free
moments have previously been studied in walking, running and
turning (Holden and Cavanagh, 1991; Lee et al., 2001; Li et al.,
2001; Jindrich et al., 2006; Umberger, 2008; Qiao et al., 2014).
However, the role free moments play in non-locomotor behaviors
and the extent to which foot posture influences free moment
production have not been studied in any species. Although it is
reasonable to hypothesize (1) that plantigrade feet may provide a
larger moment arm for the application of free moments to the
ground, and (2) that larger free moments applied to the ground could
improve performance of some behaviors that are important when
great apes fight, it is not clear that either of these predictions are true.
The suggestion that great apes are anatomically specialized for
aggressive behavior has proven to be controversial. However, the
mating systems of great ape species lead one to anticipate that
specialization for aggressive behavior would have been important in
their evolution. With the exception of bonobos, great apes are
characterized by relatively high levels of male-male contest
competition and intense physical aggression (Harcourt, 1978;
Galdikas, 1985; Goodall, 1986; deWaal, 1986; Kano, 1992;
Furuichi, 1997; Wrangham, 1999; Wrangham and Peterson, 1996;
Puts, 2010, 2016; Wilson et al., 2014; Chatters, 2016; Daly, 2016;
Rosenbaum et al., 2016; Hill et al., 2017). Additionally, as
mentioned above, male great apes are unusual among primates
because they routinely display and physically compete by striking
and grappling with their forelimbs from a bipedal stance; a mode
of fighting for which the proposed performance advantages of
plantigrade feet could be particular relevant.
In this study we used human subjects to test the functional
hypotheses that plantigrade foot posture (1) increases capacity to

 apply free moments to the ground and (2) thereby increases
performance in grappling and striking behaviors that are employed
by great apes when they fight. Ideally, we would like to test for
performance differences between the basal semi-plantigrade posture
of primates versus the derived plantigrade posture of great apes.
This, however, is not possible in any extant species because of the
immobility of the primate sub tarsal joints. Nevertheless, our
experiments comparing digitigrade versus plantigrade posture in
human subjects can falsify the hypotheses that plantigrade posture
improves the ability to apply free moments to the ground and
thereby increases performance in behaviors important for physical
competition. Importantly, a finding that plantigrade foot does not
increase performance in behaviors used by great apes when fighting
would effectively falsify the evolutionary hypothesis that selection
on performance during physical competition contributed to the
evolution and retention of plantigrade foot posture in the lineage that
gave rise to the great apes.
To test our primary prediction that plantigrade foot posture allows
production of larger free moments, we asked human subjects to
resist an increasing torsional moment applied to the long-axis of
their body from both plantigrade and digitigrade foot postures. To
determine the influence of foot posture on striking and grappling,
we measured maximum effort performance and free moment
production when subjects attempted relevant behaviors. We focused
our analyses on forelimb striking and grappling behaviors that
characterize fighting in chimpanzees and gorillas: lateral and
downward strikes, lateral and forward pushes and rearward pulls
(see Movies 1 and 2). We also measured performance in lateral
pushing when subjects stood on a low coefficient of friction
substrate that greatly limited the ability to apply free moments to the
ground.
RESULTS
Maximum voluntary free moments from plantigrade and
digitigrade posture
The maximum free moments exerted on the ground when subjects
resisted vertically oriented long-axis torsion were larger when they
resisted from plantigrade rather than digitigrade foot posture. The
median peak free moments when the subjects resisted from one foot
in digitigrade posture was 18.4 Nm (17.1–22.8 Nm, interquartile
range) compared to 53.1 Nm (51.0–61.1 Nm) when they resisted
from one foot in plantigrade posture (P-value=0.001, N=14). The
median-peak free moments when the subjects resisted from two feet
in digitgrade posture was 71.6 Nm (62.2–80.8 Nm) compared to
113.7 Nm (92.9–124.2 Nm) when they resisted from two feet in
plantigrade posture (P-value=0.001, N=14). Thus, the median-
maximum free moment produced by one foot in plantigrade posture
was 165% (155–220%) greater than the free moment produced by
one foot in digitigrade posture, and 58% (48–70%) greater when the
subjects resisted with two feet in plantigrade posture than with two
feet in digitigrade posture.
Lateral strikes
The total energy delivered to the pendulum during maximum effort
lateral strikes was greater when the subjects struck from plantigrade
than digitigrade foot posture (Table 1; N=12). The median kinetic
energy of one-foot strikes was 39.3% (24.8–48.6%, interquartile
range) greater in plantigrade than in digitigrade posture and the
median kinetic energy of two-feet strikes was 12.5% (8.8–20.0%)
greater in plantigrade than in digitigrade posture. Additionally, both
the impulse of the free moments and peak free moments were
greater during strikes from plantigrade posture (Table 1). In the
digitigrade trials, peak free moments were greater than (one-foot
trials) or equivalent to (two-feet trials) the maximum voluntary
free moments produced in the long-axis twisting trials (Table 2).
Among the 12 subjects, kinetic energy was strongly correlated with
free moment impulse for each of the four postures (Table 3).
Additionally, kinetic energy and free moment impulse were strongly
correlated when comparing mean values of the four postures within
each subject (N=4). The median within subject Pearson correlation
coefficient for the four postures of all of the subjects was 0.943
(0.916–0.989, N=12).
Lateral pushes
The total energy delivered to the pendulum during maximum
effort lateral pushes was greater from plantigrade than digitigrade
foot posture (Table 4; N=12). The median kinetic energy of one-foot
pushes was 23.8% (17.0–37.5%, interquartile range) greater in
plantigrade than in digitigrade posture and the energy of two-feet
pushes was 14.5% (8.0–25.7%) greater in plantigrade than in
digitigrade posture. Both the impulse of the free moments and
peak free moments were also greater during pushes from plantigrade
posture (Table 4). In the digitigrade trials, peak free moments
were equivalent to the maximum voluntary free moments produced
in the long-axis twisting trials (Table 2). Among the 12 subjects,
kinetic energy was strongly correlated with free moment impulse
for each of the four postures (Table 3). Additionally, kinetic
energy and free moment impulse were strongly correlated when
comparing mean values of the four postures within each subject
(N=4). The median within subject Pearson correlation coefficient
for the four postures of all the subjects was 0.966 (0.949–0.983,
N=12).

 Lateral pushes when subjects stood on a substrate with a
low coefficient of friction
To directly test the importance of free moments on performance in
lateral pushing, we compared the energy generated in maximum
effort lateral pushes when subjects stood on one foot on the normal
sandpaper substrate versus a Teflon substrate that reduced the
coefficient of friction between the subject’s foot and ground by
sixfold (Table 5; N=12). Relative to the low coefficient of friction
substrate, the median kinetic energy of lateral pushes were 48.5%
higher (34.7–101.3%, interquartile range) in digitigrade posture and
72.3% higher (53.4–98.9%) in plantigrade posture when the
subjects stood on the high coefficient of friction substrate.
Importantly, subjects were unable to maintain their forward facing
orientation when pushing from the low coefficient of friction
substrate; spinning about their vertical axis a median of 270o.
In the low coefficient of friction trials, we anticipated that the
ability to apply energy to the transducer would be primarily limited
by the subject’s rotational inertia rather than by the free moments
applied to the ground. If this were true, one would expect that there
would be little or no difference in the energy applied to the
transducer in the digitigrade and plantigrade postures when standing
on the low coefficient of friction substrate. The median difference
between plantigrade and digitigrade posture when the subjects stood
on the low friction substrate was much lower, 9.2% (2.2–20.8%),
than the median difference when they stood on high friction
substrate, 21.9% (16.2–38.4%).
Downward strikes
The total energy delivered to the pendulum during maximum effort
downward strikes was slightly, but significantly, greater when the
subjects struck from plantigrade than digitigrade foot posture
(Table 6). The median kinetic energy of one-foot strikes was 5.7%
(3.0–27.2%, interquartile range) greater in plantigrade than in
digitigrade posture, and the energy of two-feet strikes was 5.5%
(1.6–13.4%) greater in plantigrade than in digitigrade posture. Free
moments produced during downward striking were of relatively small
amplitude. Among the 11 subjects, the kinetic energy produced in
downward strikes was significantly correlated with average free
moment impulse in only one of the four postures (Table 3).
Static forward pushes
The average force applied during maximum voluntary effort static
forward pushes was greater when the subjects pushed from
plantigrade than digitigrade foot posture (Table 7; N=11). The
median average force of one-foot pushes was 70.4% greater (43.4–
83.6%, interquartile range) in plantigrade than in digitigrade posture
and the median average force of two feet pushes was 37.4% greater
(23.1–51.6%) in plantigrade than in digitigrade posture. The median
free moments were also greater during pushes from plantigrade
posture (Table 7). Among the 11 subjects, average force was
strongly correlated with average free moment for the two-foot trials,
but not for the one-foot trials (Table 3). Additionally, average
pushing force and average free moment were strongly correlated
when comparing mean values of the four postures within each
subject (N=4). The median within subject Pearson correlation
coefficient for the four postures of all the subjects was 0.962
(0.867–0.996, N=11).
Static rearward pulls
The average force applied during maximum effort static rearward
pulls was greater when the subjects pulled from plantigrade, rather
than digitigrade, foot posture (Table 8; N=11). The median average
force
of
one-foot
pulls
was
26.6%
greater
(19.4–32.5%,
interquartile range) in plantigrade than in digitigrade posture, and
the median average force of two feet pulls was 13.4% greater (8.7–
32.3%) in plantigrade than in digitigrade posture. Although not
significantly different, the average free moments tended to be
greater during pulls from plantigrade than digitigrade posture
(Table 8). Among the 11 subjects, average pulling force was not
correlated with average free moment (Table 3). However, within
each subject, average force and average free moment tended to be
correlated across the four postures (N=4). The median within subject
Pearson correlation coefficients for the four postures of all the
subjects was 0.830 (0.601-0.967, N=11).
The impact of postural instability on performance when
standing in digitigrade posture
To address the influence of postural instability (i.e. balance) on
performance during digitigrade trials compared with plantigrade
trials, we compared performance of subjects when they completed
lateral pushing trials with and without stabilizing support from their
left (non-pushing) hand (Table 9; N=8). Stabilization was provided
by resting the side of the hand against a stable vertical support. Hand
support greatly increased postural control, increasing the time that
subjects could stand digitigrade on one foot with their eyes closed
from a median of 3.6 s to greater than 30 s in all subjects. Although

DISCUSSION
Effect of foot posture on maximum effort free moment
production
The primary finding of this study is that plantigrade foot posture
increases the ability to apply free moments to the ground. In the
resistance to long-axis torsion trials, maximum free moments
produced in plantigrade posture were 165% greater than those
produced in digitigrade posture when the subjects resisted from one
foot, and 58% greater when they resisted from two feet. We suspect
that contact of the heel with the ground facilitates free moment
production by (1) maximizing the distance between the points of
force application to the ground (i.e. moment arm), and (2) situating
the rear ground contact behind the ankle joint, thereby increasing the
capacity of the rearcontact point to applyaforce couple rather than act
as a pivot point. Nevertheless, these results suggest that, all else being
equal, species that are able to adopt plantigrade foot posture, such as
bears, badgers, wolverines, many rodents, spider monkeys, and great
apes, should be able to apply greater free moments to the ground than
species that are restricted to digitigrade or unguligrade foot posture.
The increase in free moments produced in the one-foot trials
when subjects switched from digitigrade to plantigrade posture was
likely due to the increase in length of the moment arm associated
with the distance between the ball of the foot and toes versus
the distance between the heel and the toes. However, moment
arm length cannot explain why plantigrade posture increased
performance in a two-foot stance. If the relevant moment arm was
the distance between the two feet, the maximum free moment
should not be affected by the switch from plantigrade to digitigrade
foot posture. The fact that maximum free moment was greater in the
two-foot plantigrade trials, suggests that contributing force couples
are applied by one or both of the plantigrade feet as well as by the
two feet working together.
Our visual monitoring of the subjects during maximum resistance
to long-axis torsion provided some indication of what limited
performance in these trials. During the single-foot trials, recording
was terminated when the subject’s foot began to spin on the force
plate, indicating that friction was limiting. This was true for both
digitigrade and plantigrade posture. In contrast, during the two-foot
trials the feet rarely slipped and the subjects appeared to be limited
by an unidentified component of leg or trunk strength.
Effect of foot posture on performance in striking and shoving
Relative to digitigrade foot posture, plantigrade posture improved
performance in lateral striking, lateral pushing, downward striking,
forward pushing and rearward pulling. In the digitigrade trials, peak
free moments produced during lateral striking and pushing were
greater than or equivalent to the maximum voluntary free moments
produced in the long-axis twisting trials. Importantly, strong
correlations were found between performance and free moments
applied to the substrate in lateral striking, and lateral and forward
pushing. Additionally, when the capacity to apply free moments to the
ground was limited by having subjects stand on a substrate with a low
coefficient of friction, performance in lateral pushing was dramatically
reduced and subjects spun about their vertical axis. These results (1)
indicate that factorsthat limit the ability to produce free moments, such
as foot posture and substrate friction, can limit performance in
behaviors that involve the application of long-axis rotational torques to
the body; and (2) suggest that the capacity of a plantigrade foot to exert
free moments on the ground does provide an advantage in some
behaviors that are likely to be important to success in fighting.
To address the possibility that the observed differences in
performance between digitigrade and plantigrade foot posture were
a result of decreased stability when standing in digitigrade posture,
we ran trials in which stability in digitigrade stance was increased
through support with the non-pushing hand. A series of studies
on postural control have shown that light touch with the fingers or
hand on a support provides an effective orientation reference that
improves balance control in an upright stance (Jeka, 1997). Thus,
the finding that the increase in lateral pushing performance when
subjects switched from single-foot digitigrade to plantigrade posture
was not significantly different between the normal no-support and
the hand-support trials, indicates that decreased stability associated
with digitigrade posture cannot explain the observed performance
differences in digitigrade versus plantigrade performance.
Evolutionary significance of plantigrade feet in great apes
Although there are a variety of possible explanations for the evolution
of plantigrade foot posture in Hominidae, the findings that plantigrade
foot posture does have functional consequences for locomotor
energetics (Cunningham et al., 2010; Usherwood et al., 2012;
Ogueta-Alday et al., 2014; Webber and Raichlen, 2016), as well as

Downloaded from 
 for striking and grappling behaviors (this study), provide evidence
against the evolution of plantigrade foot posture due to stochastic
evolutionary process, such as genetic drift. Similarly, although it is
possible that the unusual foot posture of the great apes is the result of a
developmental constraint, there is no current evidence to support this
non-mutually exclusive possibility. Within the explanatory realms of
natural and sexual selection, there are many untested behaviors for
which plantigrade posture may provide a performance advantage.
However, as described above, there is evidence to suggest that
selection for suspension locomotion in an arboreal habitat (Gebo,
1992; Schmitt and Larson, 1995) as well as selection for more
economical locomotion could have played a role in the evolution of
plantigrade foot posture of great apes. Additionally, the results of this
study lead us to propose that selection on fighting performance must
be added to this list of possible functional explanations for the
evolution of plantigrade foot posture in Hominidae.
In this context, plantigrade foot posture may be part of a
suite of adaptations for intraspecific fighting in Hominidae. The
pronounced sexual dimorphism in body size (Plavcan, 2001,
2003, 2012; Zihlman and McFarland, 2000, Zihlman and Bolter,
2015, reviewed by Carrier and Morgan, 2015) and upper body
strength (Zihlman and McFarland, 2000), as well as the relatively
short legs of great apes (Carrier, 2007) are consistent with
specialization for fighting performance. Within the bipedal apes,
the hominins, additional characters that have been suggested to be
consistent with specialization for fighting include habitual
bipedalism (Darwin, 1871; Livingstone, 1962; Wescott, 1963;
Jablonski and Chaplin, 1993; Carrier, 2011), hand proportions
that protect the hand when it is used as a fist to strike (Morgan and
Carrier, 2013; Horns et al., 2015), increased robusticity of the face
(Puts, 2010; Carrier and Morgan, 2015), and sexual dimorphism
in upper body strength (McHenry, 1986, 1991, 1996; Bohannon,
1997; Abe et al., 2003; Lassek and Gaulin, 2009; Vasavada et al.,
2001), stature (Carrier, 2011; Stulp et al., 2015), facial robusticity
and shape (Sell et al., 2009; Puts, 2010; Carrier and Morgan,
2015), and voice (Puts et al., 2006; Puts, 2010; Sell et al., 2010;
Hill et al., 2017). Additionally, in modern humans, the size of the
muscles of the back and leg appear to be more related to the
demands of explosive behaviors that are likely to be important in
physical competition than the demands of high speed sprinting or
sustained endurance running (Carrier et al., 2015). Thus, many
traits
within
Hominidae,
including
several
of
those
most
diagnostic of both Hominidae and hominins, may be partially a
consequence of sexual selection on fighting ability in males.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We tested the ability of human subjects to apply free moments to the ground
when they performed from two different foot postures: plantigrade posture
in which the heel was in contact with the ground and helped support the
body, and digitigrade posture in which the heel was elevated such that the
body was supported by the ball of the foot and toes (Fig. 1). In addition, we
tested the effect of foot posture on performance in several behaviors that are
likely to be relevant to success during physical competition lateral striking
and pushing, downward striking, and forward pushing and rearward pulling.
All trials were completed barefoot, except in one case in which subjects
wore a sock on their right foot, described below. Nineteen healthy males
served as subjects in one or more of the experiments. The sample size for
individual tests varied from 8–14 subjects. Subjects gave informed written
consent. All procedures were approved by the University of Utah Internal
Review Board (IRB_00073326). Informed consent was obtained from all
participants, and all aspects of the study complied with the Declaration of
Helsinki. Data collected and analyzed in this study are available at the Dryad
Digital Repository (Carrier and Cunningham, 2017).
Rationale for the fighting behaviors studied
Although the social contexts in which fights occur and the injuries that result
are often described in the behavioral literature, the actual fighting behaviors
used by great apes are rarely mentioned. A few descriptions of how apes fight,
however, do exist. Detailed, eyewitness accounts of lethal fighting in
chimpanzees are provided by Goodall (1986). In these fights, groups of
three to six adult males attacked isolated individuals, usually males, from an
adjacent community. The attacks began by grappling and pulling the victim to
the ground, in some cases from out of a tree the victim had attempted to flee
into. The victim was held, pinned to the ground by one member of the group
while other members attacked by biting, hitting with hands, and kicking and
stomping on. The victims were often dragged for distances on the ground,
lifted and slammed back to the ground, and attempts were made to break arms
and legs by twisting. In these lethal attacks, a bipedal stance was used as a base
for grappling, striking with the forelimbs, as well as lifting, dragging, and
twisting the victim. Among bonobos, physical aggression includes pulling,
slapping, hitting, shoving aside, pinning down and biting (Hohmann and
Fruth, 2003). Fights between male orangutans are reported to involve
grappling and biting (Galdikas, 1985). We are not aware of published
descriptions of how gorillas fight. However, male gorillas housed together in
zoos grapple and hit each other with laterally and downward directed strikes
(Movies 1 and 2). Thus, to access the impact of foot posture on behaviors that
appear to be important in great ape fighting, we focused on lateral striking and
pushing, downward striking, forward pushing and rearward pulling. We did
not include forward punching with a closed fist in this study because it is a
derivedbehaviorofhominins(MorganandCarrier, 2013; CarrierandMorgan,
2015), and therefore evolved long after the evolution of plantigrade feet.
Analysis of free moments
Free moments generated by the subjects during maximal effort trials were
measured as a force couple by the horizontal sensors of a Kistler 9281B SN
force plate (Amherst, NY, USA). Forces applied to the force plate were
sampled at 400 Hz with a National Instruments analog-to-digital converter
(Austin, TX, USA) and stored on a Macintosh computer. To provide a
suitable level of friction between the subject’s feet and the force plate, the
surface of the force plate was covered with 120 CAMI grit sandpaper. Force

 outputs from the horizontal sensors were summed to yield the net horizontal
force. The appropriate fraction of net horizontal force (determined by the
proximity of the center of pressure to the sensors) was subtracted from the
outputs of two parallel sensors to remove translational components, yielding
equal and opposite forces with parallel lines of action (a force couple). One
of these forces was then multiplied by the distance between the sensors to
yield a moment. This procedure was carried out for both components of the
horizontal force, and their moments were summed to give the free moment
(Holden and Cavanagh, 1991).
Analysis of maximum free moments generated while resisting
vertical torsional loading
To measure the maximum free moments subjects could apply to the ground
from the different foot postures, we asked subjects to resist a vertical twisting
torque applied to their trunk as they stood barefoot on the force plate. The
subjects held a steel post, 1.83 m long, across their mid-back with the crooks
of their arms. Two experimenters, holding the ends of the post, applied a
clockwise force couple directed along the long axis of the body. The
experimenters gradually increased the magnitude of the force couple until the
subjects’ feet began to slide on the surface of the force plate or the strength of
the subject was exceeded. The distance the subjects’ feet slid on the sandpaper
was minimized so that they experienced little or no discomfort. Trials in which
subjects lost their balance were not saved. Two trials were recorded for each of
four postures: one-foot (right foot) digitigrade and plantigrade posture and
two-feet digitigrade and plantigrade posture. The sequence of the foot
postures was varied randomly between subjects. Fourteen healthy male
subjects participated in this experiment [body mass 78.5, 71.7–85.0 kg
(median and interquartile range); age 28.5, 25.5–38.5 years].
Analysis of lateral strikes and pushes
We measured performance in lateral striking and pushing with an
instrumented pendulum (Fig. 2). The energy delivered to the pendulum by
the subject was determined by calculating the change in kinetic energy,
which is one half the rotational inertia of the pendulum times the maximum
angular velocity squared. Angular velocity of the pendulum was measured
with a gyroscope (Yaw Rate Gyroscope v1.0, Vex Robotics, Greenville,
TX, USA). The rotational inertia of the pendulum was calculated to be
20.97 kg m2. Subjects stood on a force plate during striking and pushing
to allow monitoring of free moments. Three trials were recorded for each
of the four postures: one-foot (right foot, i.e. ipsilateral) digitigrade
and plantigrade posture and two-feet digitigrade and plantigrade posture.
The sequence of the foot postures was varied randomly between subjects.
Twelve healthy male subjects participated in this experiment [body mass
77.5, 70.3–83.5 kg (median and interquartile range); age 27.0, 25–34 years].
Testing the importance of free moments by reducing substrate
coefficient of friction
As an additional test of the role of free moment production in behaviors that
involve reaction forces that act to spin the body about its vertical axis, we
compared performance in lateral pushing when subjects stood on the normal
sandpaper to when they stood on a sheet of Teflon that greatly reduced the
coefficient of friction between the substrate and the subject’s foot. In
the pushing while standing on Teflon trials, the ability to apply energy to the
transducer was presumably limited by the subject’s rotational inertia rather
than the free moments applied to the ground. Subjects stood on their right
foot in digitigrade and plantigrade posture and completed maximum effort
lateral pushes against the instrumented pendulum, as described above. For
the trials done while standing on Teflon, the subjects wore a sock to further
reduce the coefficient of friction. In the Teflon trials, we recorded the angle
the subject’s body spun by noting the direction the subject’s trunk faced
once they stopped spinning with angles marked on the ground at 30-degree
intervals. Twelve healthy male subjects participated in this experiment
[body mass 78.1 kg, 73.2–83.2 kg (median and interquartile range); age
26.5, 24–30 years].
In one subject, we measured the static coefficient of friction of a barefoot
standing on sandpaper and a sock-clad foot standing on Teflon, by pulling
the subject across the forceplate with a Nylon strap wrapped around the front
of the subject’s ankle. The distance the subject’s foot slid on the sandpaper
was minimized so that he experienced only minor discomfort. The static
coefficient was calculated as the friction force (i.e. horizontal) divided by
the normal force (i.e. vertical). Average values are reported from three trials
from digitigrade and plantigrade posture for both substrates.
Analysis of downward strikes
We measured performance in downward striking with the instrumented
pendulum used in a previous study (Carrier, 2011). As with the lateral
striking and pushing trials, the energy imparted to the pendulum by the
subject was determined by calculating the change in kinetic energy. Angular
velocity of the pendulum was measured with a gyroscope (Yaw Rate

 Gyroscope v1.0, Vex Robotics, Greenville, TX, USA). For safety, the
rotational inertia of this pendulum was substantially lower than that of the
pendulum used to monitor lateral striking and pushing and was calculated to
be 1.98 kg m2. The sequence of the foot postures was varied randomly
between subjects. Eleven healthy male subjects participated in these
experiments [body mass 82.1, 76.4–90.8 kg; age 27, 25–31 years (medians
and interquartile ranges)].
Analysis of static forward pushes and rearward pulls
To quantify performance when the subjects pushed and pulled from
plantigrade and digitigrade foot posture, the subjects stood on the force plate
as they pushed or pulled with one arm in the parasagittal direction, against a
non-extensible line attached to two S-beam load cells arranged in parallel
(LCR-50, Omega, Stamford, CT, USA). Subjects were instructed to
gradually increase the applied force to maximum effort and hold it for 2 s.
We calculated the average force applied to the transducers and the average
free moment applied to the force plate during this period. In the one-foot
trials, subjects stood on the foot ipsilateral to the arm they were pushing or
pulling with. Three trials were recorded for each of the four postures: one-
foot (right foot) digitigrade and plantigrade posture and two-feet digitigrade
and plantigrade posture. The sequence of the foot postures was varied
randomly between subjects. Eleven healthy male subjects participated in
these experiments [body mass 82.1, 76.4–90.8 kg; age 27, 25–31 years
(medians and interquartile ranges)].
Testing the impact of digitigrade instability on performance
Because greater postural instability in digitigrade posture may have
impacted comparisons of performance in digitigrade to plantigrade
posture, we compared performance in maximal effort lateral pushing trials
when subjects used their left hand to stabilize themselves to trials which did
not use hand stabilization. These trials were all done when the subjects stood
on their right foot and were completed as described above. In the
stabilization trials, subjects braced the ulnar side of their left hand against a
fixed vertical surface immediately to their left, at the height of their mid-
abdomen. By resting only the side of their hand on the vertical support,
subjects were not able to apply horizontally directed pulling forces on the
support, which could have increased the torque applied to the pendulum.
Subjects were instructed to brace with their hand, being careful not to lean
against the support. To access whether or not this hand bracing increased
balance stability, we measured the time subjects could retain their balance
when standing on one foot with digitigrade posture with their eye closed,
with and without hand bracing. Eight healthy male subjects participated in
these experiments [body mass 80.8, 73.2–83.5 kg; age 26.5, 25.0–
34.0 years (medians and interquartile ranges)].
Statistical analysis
Because we suspect outlier trials are meaningful, analysis was done on mean
values of the individual subject trials. Median and 25% and 75% quartile
values of the means of the subject were calculated and are reported. To test
whether performance in digitigrade and plantigrade posture was different, we
used the Wilcoxon matched pairs test to compare subject mean values. We
assumed the results were significantly different when the P-value was less
than 0.05. In cases in which we tested for differences between foot posture in
both one-foot and two-feet trials we adopted a simple Bonferroni correction
and assumed the results were significantly different when the P-value was
less than 0.025. All tests were two-tailed. To determine if performance in
striking, pushing, pulling was correlated with the free moment applied to the
ground we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficients (R) of subject
means of slap and push kinetic energy, mean push and pull force, or turn
angle, versus subject mean impulse of the free moment or peak free moment.
