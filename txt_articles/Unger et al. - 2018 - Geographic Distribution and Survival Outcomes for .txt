Abstract
IMPORTANCE Studies showing that patients with cancer from rural areas have worse outcomes
than their urban counterparts have relied on cancer population data and did not account for
differences in access to care. Clinical trial patients receive protocol-directed care by design, so large
clinical trial databases are ideal for examining the impact of rural vs urban residency on outcomes.
OBJECTIVE To compare the geographic distribution and survival outcomes for rural vs urban
patients with cancer treated in clinical trials.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this comparative effectiveness retrospective cohort
analysis, 36 995 patients from all 50 states enrolled in 44 phase 3 and phase 2/3 SWOG (formerly the
Southwest Oncology Group) treatment trials from January 1, 1986, to December 31, 2012, were
examined. Seventeen different cancer-specific analysis cohorts were constructed. Data through
January 30, 2018, were analyzed.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Rural vs urban residency was defined using the Rural-Urban
Continuum Codes developed by the US Department of Agriculture. Multivariate Cox regression was
used to estimate the association of residency with overall survival, progression-free survival, and
cancer-specific survival, controlling for major disease-specific prognostic factors and demographic
variables and stratifying by study. Different definitions of rurality were examined. The distribution of
rural vs urban patients by geographic region was described.
RESULTS Overall, 27.7% of patients were 65 years or older (range across 17 cohort analyses,
7.8%-74.5%), 40.3% were female in the non-sex-specific analyses (range across 17 cohort analyses,
28.1%-45.9%), and 10.8% were black (range across 17 cohort analyses, 1.9%-22.4%). Overall, 19.4%
of patients (7184 of 36 995) were from rural locations. Rural patients were more likely to be aged 65
years or older (rural, 30.7% aged �65 years vs urban, 27.0% aged �65 years; difference, 3.7%; 95%
CI, 2.5%-4.9%; P < .001), were less likely to be black (rural, 5.4% vs urban, 12.1%; difference, 6.7%;
95% CI, 6.1%-7.3%; P < .001), were similar with respect to sex (rural, 40.4% female vs urban, 39.7%
female; difference, 0.6%; 95% CI, −1.4% to 2.6%; P = .53), and were well represented within major
US geographic regions (West, Midwest, South, and Northeast). Clinical prognostic factors were
similar. In multivariable regression, rural patients with adjuvant-stage estrogen receptor–negative
and progesterone receptor–negative breast cancer had worse overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.27; 95%
CI, 1.06-1.51; P = .008) and cancer-specific survival (hazard ratio, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.04-1.52; P = .02). No
other statistically significant differences for overall, progression-free, or cancer-specific survival were
found. Results were consistent regardless of the definition of rurality.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Rural and urban patients with uniform access to cancer care
through participation in a SWOG clinical trial had similar outcomes. This finding suggests that

Key Points
Question Do rural and urban patients
with cancer receiving similar care in
clinical trials have similar outcomes?
Findings In this comparative
effectiveness study, 36 995 patients
from all 50 states enrolled in 44 SWOG
treatment trials from 1986 to 2012,
composing 17 different cancer-specific
analysis cohorts, were examined. Rural
patients had statistically significantly
worse survival in only 1 of the 17 analysis
cohorts (those with adjuvant-stage,
estrogen receptor–negative and
progesterone receptor–negative breast
cancer) irrespective of how rural
residency was defined.
Meaning Improving access to uniform
treatment strategies such as those
found in clinical trials may help resolve
the disparity in cancer outcomes
between rural and urban patients.

Introduction
Nineteen percent of the US population overall, and of the US population with cancer in particular, are
from rural areas.1,2 Rural patients with cancer have been shown to have worse outcomes than their
urban counterparts. A major recent report indicated that the age-adjusted rate of cancer deaths in
rural areas from 2011 to 2015 was 180.4 per 100 000 individuals, compared with just 157.8 per
100 000 individuals in large metropolitan areas.2 Thought leaders have expressed concerns that
these differences might be attributed to rural individuals’reduced access to medical, technological,
and financial resources, as well as adverse health status and shortened life spans.3 The Cancer
Moonshot initiative emphasized that rural patients with cancer experience disproportionate
morbidity and mortality and indicated the importance of increased research into disparities between
rural and urban patients.4 Indeed, disparities in cancer outcomes for rural patients in the United
States may actually be increasing rather than decreasing.2 Whether this disparity is due to
inadequate access to quality cancer care or other characteristics of patients residing in rural areas,
such as different clinical, demographic, or disease profiles, is unclear.
In this context, an important question is whether rural and urban patients with cancer who
receive similar care have similar outcomes. To address this, we compared survival outcomes between
patients with cancer from rural vs urban locales who participated in therapeutic clinical trials. Patients
receiving care in this setting are uniformly staged, treated, and followed up under protocol-specific
guidelines, reducing the potential influences of inconsistent pretreatment evaluation, care, and
posttreatment surveillance. If outcomes between rural and urban patients with cancer in clinical trials
are similar, then access to uniform treatment strategies of the type represented by clinical trial care
could help alleviate disparities in outcomes.
Methods
Patients
Data were derived from patient medical records for trial participants enrolled between January 1,
1986, and December 31, 2012, to clinical treatment trials conducted by SWOG (formerly the
Southwest Oncology Group), a National Clinical Trials Network and Community Oncology Research
Program group sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Only data from phase 3 or large
phase 2/3 trials for which the primary analysis was previously published were included. The following
cancer types were included: acute myeloid leukemia, brain, breast, colorectal, lung, lymphoma,
myeloma, ovarian, prostate, and sarcoma (gastrointestinal stromal tumors). We combined trials with
similar histology and stage to increase our power to identify potential differences in survival
outcomes between rural and urban patients. In the case of advanced prostate cancer, we analyzed
SWOG trials S8894 and S9346 separately, because each of these trials enrolled more than 1000
patients. Each trial included in this analysis was previously approved by an institutional review board;
informed consent was previously obtained from all patients for each study included. Institutional
review board approval and informed consent of study participants for this comparative effectiveness
study was not required because secondary data that were not identifiable were used. The research
question and analysis plan were defined prospectively in accordance with the International Society
for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) reporting guideline5 for the conduct of
comparative effectiveness studies.

 Covariates and Outcome Variables
We defined rural residence using 2003 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCCs) developed by the
Economic Research Service of the US Department of Agriculture (eTable in the Supplement).6 We
matched RUCCs with patient zip codes using 2010 United States Postal Service Zip Code Crosswalk
Files from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.7 Guided by recent studies in the
literature, our primary analysis used a prespecified cut point, dividing the 9 RUCCs into 2 categories:
urban (RUCCs 1-3) vs rural (RUCCs 4-9).8-10
Each analysis adjusted for the demographic variables age (<65 years vs �65 years), self-
reported race (black vs other), and sex (where appropriate), which could potentially influence the
relationship between residency status and survival outcomes. In addition, each analysis adjusted for
important disease-specific clinical adjustment variables. Only clinical adjustment variables with a
known effect on survival that were measured in all studies within an analysis were included (see
Table 1 for clinical adjustment variables). These variables often represented those factors used to
balance randomization assignment (ie, stratification factors).
Because men represented a very small fraction of the patients with breast cancer, male patients
were excluded from the 3 breast cancer groups, and sex was not included as a covariate in these
analyses. Analyses of non-Hodgkin lymphoma did not include age as a separate covariate because
age is included in the International Prognostic Index.
The primary outcome was overall survival (OS), measured as days from study registration to
death by any cause or, for those patients still alive, as days to last contact (censored). Patients lost to
follow-up were also censored at their date of last contact. We also examined progression-free
survival (PFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) as secondary outcomes. We defined PFS as days
from study registration to the date of death by any cause, evidence of protocol-defined relapse or
progressive disease, or date of last contact for those alive and progression free (censored). We
measured CSS as days from study registration to date of cancer-specific death, death by another
cause (censored), or last contact for those alive at last contact (censored). Detailed cause-of-death
information was available for 28.0% of patient deaths. For the remaining 72.0%, we considered any
death preceded by documented relapse or progression a cancer-specific death. We limited analyses
to the first 5 years after registration in our main analysis in order to focus on cancer-related and
treatment-related survival. Patients with last contact date or death date greater than 5 years
postregistration were censored at 5 years of follow-up. Survival outcomes were grouped by adjuvant
(ie, nonmetastatic) vs advanced (ie, metastatic) to identify whether global patterns of outcomes for
rural vs urban patients differed by these disease settings.
Statistical Analysis
To examine observed survival differences by residency status, we generated Kaplan-Meier OS curves
for each of the 17 cancer cohorts, separately for rural and urban patients.11 We used multivariate Cox
regression to estimate the effect of patient residence on survival outcomes while controlling for the
major disease-specific prognostic factors and the demographic variables.12 Each analysis was
stratified by study.
We further explored whether patterns of survival between rural and urban patients might
substantively differ for different definitions of rural residency. We used variable cut point analysis to
examine the association of residency and OS for each of the 8 possible definitions of rural residency
based on the RUCCs.13,14 Although the primary analysis was based on 5 years of follow-up, for the
variable cut point analysis, we allowed follow-up to vary from 1 to 10 years to allow for different
prognosis patterns across the panel of 17 cancer types, resulting in 80 separate analyses per cancer
type, or 1360 analyses overall. For each analysis, we derived the signed (according to the direction of
the effect) χ2 statistic for the model-estimated association of rural or urban residence and OS in
multivariable Cox regression.12 We treated these 17 χ2 statistics as independent random variables and
used a 1-sample t test to assess whether they collectively differed from 0. We then plotted the
corresponding signed z scores.

 rural areas, the same as the rural proportion of the US population with cancer. Figure 1 shows a map
of the trial registrations by rural vs urban status. Although all states are represented, the states with
the fewest enrollments were Maine (82), Wyoming (93), and Rhode Island (102). Registrations in
SWOG trials generally reflect the geographic population patterns of the United States, although with
more patients enrolled from the Midwest (39% vs 21%) and fewer from the south (24% vs 37%).
Rural patients were well represented within major geographic regions in the United States (West,
Midwest, South, and Northeast) (Figure 1).
Patient Characteristics
Overall, 27.7% (range across the 17 cohort analyses, 7.8%-74.5%) of patients (10 247 of 36 995) were
aged 65 years or older, 40.3% (range across 17 cohort analyses, 28.1%-45.9%; 5381 of 13 360
patients) were female in the non-sex-specific analyses, and 10.8% (range across 17 cohort analyses,
1.9%-22.4%; 4003 of 36 995 patients) were black. Table 2 shows these statistics as well as
descriptions of the clinical prognostic factors used in the analyses, both overall and separately by
rural and urban residence. Patients residing in rural areas were older on average (rural, 30.7% aged
�65 years vs urban, 27.0% aged �65 years; difference, 3.7%; 95% CI, 2.5%-4.9%; P< .001), were
similar with respect to sex (rural, 40.4% female vs urban, 39.7% female; difference, 0.6%; 95% CI,
−1.4% to 2.6%; P= .53), and were less likely to report being black (rural, 5.4% vs urban, 12.1%;
difference, 6.7%; 95% CI, 6.1%-7.3%; P< .001) than patients residing in urban areas. There were very
few statistically significant differences between rural and urban patients with respect to clinical
prognostic factors.

 Survival Outcomes
The median follow-up time among patients still alive at the date of last contact for the primary
analysis was the same for rural and urban patients (5.0 years each). There were few clear observed
differences by residency status in OS using Kaplan-Meier curves (eFigure in the Supplement). In
patients with adjuvant-stage estrogen receptor–negative, progesterone receptor–negative breast
cancer, multivariate Cox regression results showed worse OS (hazard ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.06-1.51;
P = .008) and worse CSS (hazard ratio, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.04-1.52; P = .02) for patients residing in rural
areas. No other statistically significant differences for any survival outcome for any of the remaining
16 disease cohorts were observed (Figure 2).
Variable Cut Point Analyses
Figure 3 shows the results of the variable cut point analyses. Negative z scores reflect better
outcomes for rural patients; positive z scores reflect worse outcomes for rural patients. The division
of the RUCCs into urban (1) vs rural (2-9) maximized the association between residence and OS
across the panel of 17 cancer cohorts. This categorization is problematic, however, because defining

 codes 2 and 3 as rural is not representative and results in a rural-to-urban ratio that is much different
from that of the US population. The second highest average association between residence and OS
occurred for rural defined as RUCCs 1 to 3 vs urban defined as RUCCs 4 to 9, reflecting the cut point
specified for our primary analysis. Importantly, there was no evidence that any combination of RUCC
cut point and follow-up time (1 to 10 years) resulted in a general pattern of better or worse survival
for rural patients with cancer across the 17 cancer cohorts.
Discussion
Numerous prior studies have documented inferior survival for rural patients with cancer.10,15-17
However, these studies did not adequately account for differences in access to cancer care. To our
knowledge, no prior study has systematically compared cancer outcomes in clinical trial participants
who reside in urban vs rural settings. This comprehensive analysis examined nearly 37 000 patients
with a wide variety of cancer types and cancer stages. All participants were uniformly staged, treated,
and followed up under protocol-directed care in a trial setting. Although rural trial participants were
older on average and less likely to identify as black than their urban counterparts, after adjustment
for these factors and important clinical prognostic factors, we found no systematic pattern of
differences in survival outcomes by residency status, even under varied definitions of rural residency.
Thus, this study contributes to the overall evidence base about differences in survival outcomes
between rural and urban patients with cancer by showing that under similar treatment conditions
within a clinical trial setting, rural and urban patients having the included cancer types do in fact have
similar outcomes. This finding suggests that previously observed differences in outcomes for rural
and urban patients with cancer may be due, in part, to inadequate receipt of guideline-concordant
cancer care (as provided in clinical trials) rather than other factors intrinsic to residing in rural areas,
such as unmeasurable differences in cancer prognosis or socioeconomic status.18 This conclusion is
reinforced by the observation of very few differences in clinical prognostic factors between rural vs
urban patients in our study.
It is more difficult to access adequate medical care for rural individuals.3,19 In the United States,
rural residency has emerged as an important predictor of care access in the general population of
individuals with cancer.2 At the same time, rural oncology resources are sparse; although 20% of the
population is rural, only 3% of oncologists work in rural areas.20 Rural patients with cancer are
required to travel much greater distances to receive care, adding time and financial burdens to
treatment. One study found that fewer than 50% of rural patients with colorectal cancer in small or
isolated rural areas had access to an oncologist within 30 miles.21 This travel burden can result in
lower rates of standard care; rural patients with cancer were found to be about half as likely to receive

 breast-conserving therapy for early-stage breast cancer compared with the national average, and
rates declined further as travel distance increased.22 A large study of nearly 35 000 patients found
that patients with stage III colon cancer who had to travel very long distances (�250 miles) to visit an
oncologist were only one-third as likely to receive adjuvant chemotherapy.23 Research from Australia
proposes numerous access issues that affect receipt of quality care, including delayed diagnosis due
to limited access to screening or prevention tools, limited access to treating specialists, financial
barriers to travel for treatment, and the physical burden of travel.24-26 Furthermore, residents of rural
areas are least likely to have private health care coverage, accentuating disparities in access to health
care and prevention services.27,28 Unfortunately, our study is unable to shed light on these issues
given that all patients we studied were enrolled in trials.
These findings have implications for the current policy debates regarding the Affordable Care
Act (ACA). Nineteen percent of patients with cancer reside in rural areas, the same as the rate of
clinical trial patients from rural areas observed in this study.1,2 Therefore, rural patients with cancer
make up a sizeable minority of patients with cancer who may have special needs.29 It is estimated
that at least 22 million people will lose health care coverage if the ACA is dismantled, 14 million
through loss of expanded Medicaid coverage.30 In many states, rural patients benefit
disproportionately from Medicaid expansion. Adequate insurance is key to ensuring access to quality
care. Therefore, reducing insurance access through policy prescriptions that limit or dismantle the
ACA may disproportionately impact health care access for rural patients, again further widening
disparities in outcomes between rural and urban patients with cancer.
Models for improving access to quality cancer care in rural settings do exist. In Australia, the
establishment of Regional Cancer Centers of Excellence are linked to major urban cancer centers to
provide multidisciplinary care, improve support services, and improve clinical trial participation.31
Successful centers have substantially increased the number of patients treated locally, removing a
significant burden for rural patients. A shared approach between local practitioners and specialists
could be a particularly useful model.32 Communications facilitated through teleoncology models
have been found to improve access to specialist consultations and receipt of chemotherapy closer to
home.32,33 In the United States, the NCI’
s National Community Oncology Research Program, of which
SWOG is a member, is designed to bring clinical trials to community investigators and patients.34 The
success of this program is reflected by the results of our study, showing representative enrollment
of rural patients with cancer from different regions throughout the United States (Figure 1). The
Cancer Moonshot Blue Ribbon Report recommends the establishment of a large-scale patient
participation network for comprehensive tumor profiling.4 Patients would enroll directly in the
network, an approach that could reduce barriers to access to comprehensive cancer testing and
novel treatments for rural and other medically disadvantaged groups.
Limitations
The results of this analysis are limited by the fact that they may not represent patterns of outcomes
for rural vs urban patients receiving quality care outside of a trial setting. Clinical trial participants
have been shown to have better outcomes than those treated in a nontrial setting in the short term
(ie, the first year after diagnosis), likely due to differences in baseline comorbid conditions.35
Although this could impact the absolute estimates of survival outcomes for patients examined in this
analysis, it is less likely to affect the relative rates by rural vs urban status. Moreover, a randomized
comparison of rural vs urban patients and cancer survival outcomes is clearly not feasible in this
setting; thus, although our regression results accounted for important demographic and clinical
prognosis factors, the potential remains that unknown confounders could influence the results. For
instance, rural patients who participate in clinical trials may also be more likely to have improved
health behaviors,2 although we found very little evidence of measurable differences between rural
and urban patients in clinical risk factors (Table 2). Also, travel distance may lead to trial participation
barriers that differ between rural and urban patients with cancer. However, the influence of this
factor for patients choosing to participate in trials (as opposed to receiving care outside of a trial) is

 uncertain,36 especially because patients in urban areas may also choose to travel long distances for
trial participation. The analysis of CSS was limited by incomplete cause-of-death information.
Furthermore, we cannot presently explain why rural patients in the estrogen receptor–negative,
progesterone receptor–negative, adjuvant breast cancer cohort had worse survival. One possibility is
that residency is more relevant in adjuvant cancer settings, where prognosis is better overall,
although we observed survival differences in only 1 of the 4 adjuvant cohorts we examined. Another
possibility is that rural patients with cancer may be more likely to have delays in chemotherapy
administration, which can adversely affect survival in patients with estrogen receptor–negative,
progesterone receptor–negative cancers in particular.37
Conclusions
Substantial efforts to identify and mitigate disparities in access to care and outcomes based on race,
ethnicity, and socioeconomic factors have received great attention.38 Yet few efforts or research
have focused on disparities related to geographic residency, despite the fact that the rural population
in the United States represents 1 in 5 individuals. This is the largest examination of survival outcomes
for rural vs urban patients with cancer receiving care in a clinical trial setting. The finding of almost
no differences in outcomes by residency status across 17 different patient cohorts has potential
policy implications. If rural and urban patients with cancer receiving similar care also have similar
outcomes, then a reasonable inference is that the best means by which to improve outcomes for
rural patients with cancer may be to improve their access to quality care. Better access to affordable
health care insurance, better access to screening and prevention tools, better access to treating
specialists, improved resources for traveling to receive care, and innovative new networks to give
rural patients better access to new, novel treatments and clinical trials are all likely to improve
outcomes for patients with cancer in rural areas. Thus multiple parallel efforts may begin to
ameliorate the persistent disparity in cancer outcomes between rural and urban patients.
