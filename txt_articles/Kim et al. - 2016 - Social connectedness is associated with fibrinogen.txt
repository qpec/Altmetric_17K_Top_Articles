Socially isolated individuals face elevated rates of illness and death. Conven-
tional measures of social connectedness reflect an individual’s perceived
network and can be subject to bias and variation in reporting. In this
study of a large human social network, we find that greater indegree, a
sociocentric measure of friendship and familial ties identified by a subject’s
social connections rather than by the subject, predicts significantly lower
concentrations of fibrinogen (a biomarker of inflammation and cardiac
risk), after adjusting for demographics, education, medical history and
known predictors of cardiac risk. The association between fibrinogen and
social isolation, as measured by low indegree, is comparable to the effect
of smoking, and greater than that of low education, a conventional measure
of socioeconomic disadvantage. By contrast, outdegree, which reflects an
individual’s perceived connectedness, displays a significantly weaker
association with fibrinogen concentrations.
1. Introduction
Many species exhibit social hierarchies, and individuals’ positions within them
can profoundly affect their lives and health [1]. Socially isolated humans face
particularly elevated risks of illness and death [2–5]. Isolated individuals
have higher rates of behavioural risk factors such as smoking, drinking to
excess and overeating [6,7], but in aggregate such risk factors probably account
only for a minority of the relationship between social position and health [8].
Chief among the health risks of social isolation are ischaemic heart disease
and stroke [9]. These conditions, the two leading causes of death worldwide
[10], result respectively from inadequate blood supply to the heart and brain.
When the vascular endothelium is damaged by trauma, the exposure of sub-
endothelial
collagen
and
tissue
factor
triggers
a
cascade
of
reactions
terminating in the conversion by thrombin of fibrinogen to fibrin, the principal
constituent of clots (electronic supplementary material, figure S1) [11]. Though
haemostasis is essential for survival, excessive generation of fibrin leads to throm-
bosis, the blockage of blood vessels that constitutes the final pathway of
ischaemic heart disease and stroke.
Risk of thrombosis, in turn, is governed in part by stress. The mammalian
stress response famously mobilizes bodily resources for ‘fight or flight,’ for
instance by raising an animal’s heart rate and blood pressure in order to
divert energy to active skeletal muscle. The stress response also increases
hepatic synthesis of fibrinogen, which promotes quicker cessation of bleeding
when trauma is incurred [12,13]. But the stress reaction, while lifesaving in

 the acute phase, can become pathologic when chronic. If
blood

remains
elevated
beyond

immune system is persistently stimulated, chronic inflam-
mation
may
arise;
and
if
coagulation
factors
are
upregulated to clot wounds that never occur, pathologic
thrombosis can result [14].
Indeed, elevated fibrinogen levels predict future ischae-
mic heart disease and stroke [15,16], and, as early as 1985,
fibrinogen was identified as a possible link between disad-
vantaged social position and risk of cardiac death [17].
Fibrinogen has been linked to low occupational status,
education and sense of control [18], as well as to perceptions
of being socially undermined [19], and to self-reported
loneliness and isolation [20].
Extant
studies
have
assessed
‘social
position’
with
measures such as income and educational attainment, or
with social relationships reported by the individuals them-
selves [21]. But if the social structures associated with stress
are indeed phenomena that transcend the actions and percep-
tions of individuals alone [22], then a ‘sociocentric’ measure
of social position, which maps the entire network and reflects
social ties that may not be the same ties identified by the sub-
ject herself, may furnish a more ecologically valid measure of
the relationship between social position and health. There is a
meaningful difference, for instance, between the number of
social contacts named by a subject (outdegree), and the
number of contacts who themselves name that subject as a
contact when queried (indegree). Outdegree is known to the
subject, and reflects her perceived position in her network.
Indegree, by contrast, is a sociocentric property that reflects
the sum of all declared relationships incident on an individual,
and can be reliably known only by assessing the whole net-
work. While outdegree is likely to reflect the perceived
support and status captured by conventional measures of
social position, indegree may furnish a more accurate measure
of the support and resources received. To our knowledge, prior
work has not explored the relationship between a sociocentric
measure of connectedness and a physiological marker of
stress.
Here, we report on the relationship between degree cen-
trality and levels of fibrinogen in a large human social
network. We use whole network data for thousands of indi-
viduals to calculate the indegree and outdegree centrality of
all individuals in the network. We adjust for education,
demographics, medical history and known predictors of
hypercoagulability to assess the relationship between social
connectedness and fibrinogen, a principal biomarker of
chronic stress, hypercoagulability and eventual cardiac death.
2. Material and methods
The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) is a community-based
observational cohort study initiated in 1948. Detailed study
design and selection criteria are described elsewhere [23]. The
Framingham Offspring Study (FOS) began in 1971 with the
recruitment of 5124 men and women who were offspring of
the original FHS participants, or these offspring’s spouses.
In each generation of the study, participants underwent
routine medical histories and physical examinations, laboratory
studies
of
cardiovascular
risk
factors
and
anthropometric
measurements every 3–8 years. Recent waves of the study have
included collection of a panel of biomarkers including fibrinogen.
Here, we use data from Wave 5 of the FOS, which ran from 23
January 1991 to 29 June 1995, and which included fibrinogen
values for the greatest number of individuals (n ¼ 3568).
We construct a network of friendship and familial ties using
administrative data, as previously described [7,24–26]. To best
match the social network data to the dates of fibrinogen measure-
ment, we include only ties initiated prior to 29 June 1995, and
terminated after 23 January 1991 (the end and start dates of
Wave 5 of the study, respectively). We include ties of the follow-
ing types: friend, spouse, sibling, parent, child, cousin and other
relative. We weight all ties equally. For all individuals with fibri-
nogen observations, we calculate total indegree (i.e. incoming
nominations of all permitted types), friendship indegree, sibship
size and total outdegree.
We first characterize fibrinogen as a function of basic demo-
graphic and health variables: age, sex, body mass index (BMI),
smoking status, income and educational attainment. We then
examine the bivariate relationships between fibrinogen levels
and indegree, and fibrinogen and outdegree.
As biomarker levels can be partially heritable, the inclusion of
familial ties in the network could induce clustering on fibrinogen
levels, and thus correlated observations, for reasons unrelated to
individuals’ overall social connectedness. To mitigate the potential
effects of such familial clustering, we assess for assortativity on
fibrinogen [27], and include as a control in our statistical models
the mean fibrinogen level of each individual’s direct social
contacts in the network.
We estimate a series of linear models to characterize the
relationship between indegree and fibrinogen. We regress fibrino-
gen levels on indegree, with and without loge transformations of
both variables, and adjusting for age, sex, mean fibrinogen level
of social contacts, educational attainment, self-reported smoking,
use of cholesterol-lowering, antihypertensive and antidepressant
medications, and medical risk factors including BMI, systolic
and diastolic blood pressure, and levels of total and HDL choles-
terol. We estimate additional models with indegree measures
restricted to friendship or sibship ties. Finally, we estimate analo-
gous models regressing fibrinogen on outdegree, a conventional
egocentric measure of social connectedness.
3. Results
The social network at Wave 5 contains 22 633 individuals,
connected via 45 286 friendship and familial ties. In total,
66.0% of individuals (n ¼ 14 942) are connected in the
single largest component. Indegree values (number of incom-
ing friendship and familial nominations) range from 0 to 28,
with a median value of 4 (electronic supplementary material,
figure S2). Outdegree (number of outgoing friendship and
familial nominations) ranges from 2 to 32, with a median
value of 10.
A total of 3568 individuals had fibrinogen measurements
taken during the study period. Fibrinogen values range from
138 to 815 mg per 100 ml, with a median value of 303 mg per
100 ml (figure 1). Fibrinogen values are greater for women
(two-sample t-test, p ¼ 0.01) and smokers ( p , 0.0001). Fibri-
nogen is positively correlated with age (r ¼ 0.27, p , 0.0001)
and BMI (r ¼ 0.25, p , 0.0001), and negatively with years of
formal education (r ¼ 20.15, p , 0.0001) and with annual
income in FOS Wave 3 (1983–1987, r ¼ 20.07, p ¼ 0.0004).
Fibrinogen levels are clustered in the network, with an
assortativity coefficient [27] of 0.14. To account for correlated
fibrinogen values across familial ties, we calculate the mean
fibrinogen value of an individual’s social contacts. A total

 measurements have social contacts who also have fibrinogen
measured. As expected, an individual’s fibrinogen level is
correlated with the mean fibrinogen level of her social
contacts (r ¼ 0.19, p , 0.0001).
Individuals nominated more often as friends and family
members (i.e. with higher indegree) have lower levels of
fibrinogen (figure 2; r ¼ 20.14, p , 0.0001). By contrast, out-
degree (the number of social contacts named by a subject) is
more weakly associated with the subject’s fibrinogen level
(electronic supplementary material, figure S3, r ¼ 20.04,
p ¼ 0.007). The difference in correlations is significant at
p , 0.0001 (Fisher r-to-z transformation [28]).

 We estimate a series of linear models regressing fibrino-
gen levels on indegree, adjusting for age, sex, years of
education (a conventional measure of social position), and a
host of cardiovascular risk factors and related medication
use (electronic supplementary material, table S1). In a mini-
mal model adjusting for age, sex and education, the
relationship between indegree and fibrinogen is such that
the most highly connected people in the network are pre-
dicted to have 0.96 s.d. lower fibrinogen values than the
least connected ( p , 0.0001, Model 1a). Adjusting for cardiac
risk factors and medication use attenuates the relationship
between indegree and fibrinogen by 2% (Model 1b). When
accounting additionally for the mean fibrinogen levels of an
individual’s social contacts, the relationship between inde-
gree and fibrinogen is attenuated further by 6%, remaining
highly significant ( p , 0.0001, Model 2a).
When including only friendship ties in the calculation of
indegree, individuals with the most friend nominations are
predicted to have 0.40 s.d. lower fibrinogen than those with
none ( p , 0.0001, Model 2b). When including only sibship
ties, individuals from the largest sibships are predicted to
have 0.45 s.d. lower fibrinogen than those from the smallest
( p , 0.0001, Model 2c). Thus, it appears that friendship and
sibship contribute additively to the relationship between
connectedness and fibrinogen levels.
We estimate models in which we loge-transform values of
indegree, fibrinogen or both. In all cases, the estimated
relationship between indegree and fibrinogen, net of all con-
trols, is negative and highly significant ( p , 0.0001). When
re-transforming the coefficient estimates, their substantive
magnitudes, measured in terms of standard deviations of
fibrinogen, are attenuated from Model 2a by 21% when
loge-transforming both indegree and fibrinogen (Model 3a),
or indegree alone. Loge-transformation of fibrinogen alone
(Model 3b) has no effect compared with the primary,
untransformed Model 2a.
In analogous models regressing fibrinogen levels on out-
degree (electronic supplementary material, table S2), the
relationship between outdegree and fibrinogen is such that the
individuals nominating the most friends and family members
are predicted to have 0.50 s.d. lower fibrinogen values than
those nominating the fewest, after adjusting for age, sex, edu-
cation and known cardiac risk factors (p , 0.0001, Model 4).
Adjusting for the fibrinogen levels of social contacts attenuates
the relationship between outdegree and fibrinogen by 9%
(Model 5a). When including only friendship ties, outdegree is
not significantly associated with fibrinogen (Model 5b).
4. Discussion
Many species, humans included, inhabit complex social
structures of dominance and support [29,30] and individuals’
positions within these structures can profoundly affect their
lives and health [1]. The soluble protein fibrinogen, which
permits wound healing in health and thrombosis in disease,
is a marker for both coronary risk [16] as well as self-reported
isolation and stress [18,20], but has not previously been
studied in relation to a sociocentric measure of connected-
ness. Here, we report on the relationship between degree
centrality and levels of fibrinogen in a large human social net-
work.
Adjusting
for
education,
demographics,
known
medical predictors of hypercoagulability, and the fibrinogen
levels of an individual’s social contacts, a greater number of
incoming friendship and familial ties predicts significantly
lower levels of fibrinogen.

Figure 2. Socially isolated individuals exhibit higher levels of the clotting factor

values for Wave 5 of the Framingham Offspring Study (n ¼ 3568 with fibrino-
gen measurements). Individuals nominated more often as friends and family
members have lower levels of the clotting factor fibrinogen (r ¼ 20.14,
p , 0.0001). Points are jittered horizontally to better depict the density of
the data around discrete values of indegree. Panel (b) shows the largest con-
nected subcomponent of the social network, containing 66.0% of the
individuals in the whole network. Of the 14 942 individuals in the largest com-
ponent, 2451 (16.4%) have fibrinogen measurements. Redder colouring
indicates higher fibrinogen levels, and yellower colouring indicates lower fibri-
nogen levels. Nodes in the component without fibrinogen measurements (used
for calculation of centrality measures and for layout of the graph) are depicted
minimally in pale grey. Node size is proportional to indegree. The network is
laid out using the Fruchterman–Reingold algorithm, tuned for greater repul-
sion between nodes. Low-fibrinogen (yellower) individuals tend to have higher
indegree (larger diameter) and to be globally or locally central, whereas a pre-
ponderance of high-fibrinogen (redder) individuals have lower indegree (smaller
diameter) and are relatively more isolated in the social network.

 The magnitude of the relationship is considerable, with
social isolation (i.e. low indegree) in our study population,
net of controls, predicting elevations in fibrinogen compar-
able to the effect of smoking. In our models, an additional
social connection predicts a greater decrement in fibrinogen
than even an additional year of education. Educational
attainment is among the most robust and predictive measures
of social status as it relates to health [31,32]. Thus, the
inclusion of educational attainment as a control in our
models allows us to evaluate the relationship between
social connectedness and fibrinogen net of socioeconomic
status as conventionally defined.
Our basic descriptive analyses of fibrinogen with respect
to sex, age and education are consistent with previous studies
[18], and the basic direction of the indegree finding is consist-
ent with the vast literature on the socioeconomic gradient in
health [33,34]. As in previous studies, smoking accounts for
some but not all of the social gradient in fibrinogen [18,35].
What, then, is added by the use of a sociocentric measure
of connectedness? Research on social isolation and mortality
has conventionally treated networks egocentrically, with the
structure and function of networks assessed from the individ-
ual’s perspective [9]. Though the power of these measures to
predict health outcomes is indisputable, what the measures
actually mean has been open to much debate, with ‘net-
works’
often
invoked
more
as
metaphor
than
as
measurement [9,36]. In our analyses, greater social connect-
edness, as measured by the sociocentric measure indegree
(the number of times an individual is nominated as a friend
or family member by others in the network) is associated
with substantially lower levels of fibrinogen. The link
between social connectedness and lower fibrinogen reflects
independently significant effects of friendship and familial
ties, suggesting that different sources of indegree contribute
additively to its protective effect. This finding is consistent
with research in non-human primates, in which an aggregate
measure of connectedness is more predictive of health than a
single form of affiliation [37].
By contrast, outdegree (the number of social contacts
named by an individual), despite its similar range to indegree
in the data, is significantly less predictive of fibrinogen
values, and the association vanishes when stratifying by
relationship type. While outdegree signals the perceived sup-
port and status captured by conventional measures of social
connectedness, indegree is more likely to reflect the social
support, resources and recognition an individual actually
receives. Furthermore, indegree is, by definition, less subject
to individual variation in the perception and reporting of
the psychosocial environment (such as potential gender
effects on the self-reporting of social connections), or to cul-
tural or socioeconomic differences in the ‘self-enhancement’
bias [38].
Social network position has also been theorized to be
associated with other features of individuals, such as immu-
nity and personality [39–41]. Being central or peripheral in
the social network would, in principle, expose a person to
different types of infection risk, and may therefore correlate
with both immune genes and function. In this way, diverse
physiological (and psychological) phenotypes may be distributed
in meaningful ways across human social networks.
Though
human
and
non-human
sociality
differ
in
obvious ways, the association between indegree and fibrino-
gen we observe may have biological relevance beyond
humans alone. Though social dominance hierarchies are
known to affect the health of their members, most notably in
non-human primates [1], recent evidence has also demon-
strated affiliative, non-hierarchical and non-kin relationships
in primates, birds, ungulates and cetaceans [42]. Such relation-
ships lend themselves to sociocentric network analyses of the
type we deploy here [43]. Because the coagulation cascade
itself is highly conserved across mammals [44], non-human
friendship networks may also modulate fibrinogen and
other biomarkers of coagulation and inflammation, although
as non-human ties are ascertained through observation
rather than nomination, determining the potential directedness
of these ties (in order, for instance, to distinguish between
indegree and outdegree, as we do here) may require novel
ethological methods.
Our study has limitations. The study population of the
FHS is exclusively American and predominantly white, and
our findings may not generalize to other settings or groups.
The FHS social network dataset also has well-known limit-
ations, although these data are still of extremely high quality
[45]. More importantly, causal inferences cannot be drawn
from a cross-sectional design. Social connectedness or isolation
may alter the stress response and thereby change the physio-
logic set point of fibrinogen and other biomarkers [46,47].
But it may also be the case that disadvantaged individuals,
perhaps via early life factors [18], develop both higher fibrino-
gen and fewer social connections. Future work will benefit
from longitudinal measurements of both network position
and inflammatory biomarkers across the lifecourse.
More generally, while our study specifies social connect-
edness more precisely than previous work, the mechanisms
through which social connectedness may mediate fibrinogen
remain subject to debate. Indegree differences in fibrinogen
must reflect indegree differences in the determinants of fibri-
nogen. Our analyses isolate a robust relationship between
social connectedness and fibrinogen net of age, sex, education
and conventional predictors of hypercoagulability and car-
diac risk, but the specific exposures or resources through
which indegree may mediate fibrinogen remain to be
shown.
Does
the
relationship
between
indegree
and
fibrinogen reflect social support, social influence, social
engagement, access to social or material resources or another
mechanism altogether?
The now-ubiquitous concept of the coronary ‘risk factor’
originated with the FHS [48]. But while such risk factors
have overwhelmingly measured proximate behavioural and
biological markers, research on the social determinants of
health has identified persistent effects of socioeconomic pro-
cesses difficult to reconcile with a biomedical approach. How
do social phenomena like ‘status’ and ‘support’ translate to
the physiologic mechanisms of disease? The causal question
is complicated by the variegated and often figurative opera-
tionalizations of the concept of ‘social position’ [9]. By
specifying social position and connectedness precisely, repro-
ducibly and independently of individual biases in self-report,
network analysis can help connect the ‘macro’ level of social
structure to the ‘micro’ level psychobiologic mechanisms
through which adverse or protective exposures become
manifest in individual health and disease.
