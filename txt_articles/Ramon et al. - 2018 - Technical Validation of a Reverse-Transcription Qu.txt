Introduction
Colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer in 
men and the second most common in women with an esti-
mated 1.36 million new cases per year on a worldwide basis.1 
Median overall survival for the metastatic stage (metastatic 
colorectal cancer [mCRC]) has increased dramatically over the 
past decade due to the implementation of new therapies 
including the use of the anti-epithelial growth factor receptor 
(EGFR) antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab and the anti-
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody bevaci-
zumab,2 as well as the use of more aggressive surgical approaches 
toward oligometastatic disease, especially in patients with liver 
metastases.3 The use of the anti-EGFR antibodies cetuximab 
and panitumumab is restricted to extended RAS wild-type 
(WT) tumors because there is no clinical benefit from either 
therapy in patients with RAS-mutant tumors.4–7 Based on the 
above, current guidelines for the treatment of mCRC recom-
mend testing for RAS mutational status prior to initiating 
first-line treatment in patients with mCRC.8
Although RAS mutation is a negative predictive biomarker 
allowing identification of patients who will not benefit from 
anti-EGFR therapy, up to 30% of RAS WT patients treated 
with anti-EGFR therapy do not respond to treatment.7,9,10 As a 
result, RAS mutational status alone is unable to clearly identify 
responders versus nonresponders for anti-EGFR therapy. 
Because the side effect profile for anti-EGFR therapy, especially 
skin toxicity, is significant, and alternative biologic therapies are 
available (e.g. bevacizumab), the identification of biomarkers 
which enable the further personalization of the treatment in 
RAS WT mCRC is needed to better identify patients who will 
likely respond to cetuximab and panitumumab.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNA mole-
cules that play a key role in the regulation of intracellular pro-
cesses through posttranscriptional regulation of gene 
expression. Modification of miRNA gene expression contrib-
utes to most cancers through different types of alterations.11

ABSTRACT: MiR-31-3p expression has been shown to be a predictive biomarker for response to anti-epithelial growth factor receptor therapy 
in patients with RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). To aid in the quantification of miR-31-3p expression in formalin-fixed 
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) primary tumor samples from patients with mCRC, a reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-qPCR) assay was developed and validated. Assay development included the identification of a microRNA reference standard and the 
determination of an appropriate relative quantification cutoff for differentiating low versus high miR-31-3p expression. Sample specimens for the 
validation studies included both FFPE slides and shavings. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) efficiency and linearity, analytical sensitivity and 
specificity, assay robustness, reproducibility, and accuracy were demonstrated across a number of test conditions and differing quantitative 
PCR platforms. The data from this study provide evidence as to the feasibility of quantifying the expression of miR-31-3p from FFPE tumor 
tissue using a standardized RT-qPCR assay.

diagnostic, prognostic, or predictive purposes in colorectal 
cancer.12,13 In colorectal cancer, miR-31 is frequently upregu-
lated in tumors compared with normal corresponding tissue.14 
Upregulation of the mature forms of miR-31, miR-31-3p, and 
miR-31-5p is associated with advanced disease stage and with 
poor response to anti-EGFR therapy based on several small 
retrospective studies.15–22 Several authors have also recently 
reported that miR-31-3p expression levels in primary tumors 
can predict response to anti-EGFR therapy in metastatic 
colorectal cancer.23–25
To enable the reliable clinical measurement of miR-31-3p 
expression levels in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) 
tumor specimens to assist in the identification of patients with 
RAS WT mCRC who will more likely respond to anti-EGFR 
therapy, we have developed and validated a sensitive and spe-
cific real-time reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase 
chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay to measure miR-31-3p 
expression in primary tumors of patients with mCRC. Herein, 
we describe the development and validation of this test.
Materials and Methods
Sample type and source
The miR-31-3p expression test is designed to determine the 
expression of the miRNA miR-31-3p in FFPE tissue obtained 
from primary tumors of patients with mCRC. This study was 
limited to the use of FFPE samples because this sample type is 
the current standard used in clinical practice for the analysis of 
RAS and BRAF mutational status in patients with metastatic 
colorectal cancer. The FFPE samples can be in the form of 
slides, shavings, or punch biopsies. To ensure an accurate deter-
mination of the level of miR-31-3p expression from the tumor, 
the FFPE sample was obtained from the tumor area with care 
taken to avoid sampling from the surrounding healthy tissues. 
Pathologic review of a representative hematoxylin-eosin–
stained slide was performed to ensure that sufficient tumor tis-
sue is available with at least 20% tumor cell content.
Sample materials used for this study included archival 
FFPE tumor samples (slides only) from consented subjects 
enrolled in the FIRE-3 (NCT00433927) and PICCOLO 
(ISRCTN93248876) prospective, randomized clinical trials, 
and tumor samples (shavings only) received by Laboratoire 
CERBA from patients being tested as a part of routine care. 
Laboratoire CERBA is authorized by the French Ministry of 
Health to use residual testing material for scientific purposes 
(N°AC-2015-2418). Characteristics associated with individu-
als whose FFPE tumor samples were used for this study are 
shown in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2.
Sample preparation and RNA extraction
Total RNA was extracted from the tumor sample using a ded-
icated kit design for FFPE samples and subsequent quantita-
tive polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) reactions (Table 1). All 
kits were used in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions. 
Studies demonstrated that the miRNeasy FFPE, AllPrep 
DNA/RNA FFPE, and QIAsymphony RNA kits (Qiagen, 
Hilden, Germany) and Maxwell 16 LEV RNA FFPE kit 
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA) are compatible with the miR-
31-3p quantification method described below (data not 
shown).
Following total RNA extraction, quantity and quality evalua-
tions were performed using capillary electrophoretic RNA quali-
fication with a Fragment Analyzer (AATI, Evry, France), 
Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Les Ulis, France), Experion (Bio-Rad 
Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) and/or via UV absorbance 
with a NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 
Waltham, MA, USA). To be accepted for further testing, sam-
ples were required to have a significant amount of both small 
RNAs and miRNAs between 20 and 200 nucleotides.
Preparation of reference standards
FirstChoice® Human Brain Total RNA (Ambion, Austin, TX, 
USA) was used as a reference for performing standard curves. 
The reference standard was diluted in nuclease-free water to 
obtain 4 different quantities for reverse transcription (RT) 
(details in Supplementary Appendix 1).
miR-calibrator selection and miR-calibrator 
expression stability
A comprehensive literature review and microarray studies of 
FFPE mCRC tumor samples were performed to identify an 
appropriate miRNA to use for the normalization of miRNA 
RT-qPCR data obtained from the miR-31-3p expression 
quantification test. The reference gene selected had the lowest 
standard deviation for the average cycle threshold (Ct) value 
Table 1. RNA extraction kits validated for use with the miR-31-3p quantification assay.

After identification of the miR-calibrator, its stability was then 
qualified by testing 189 FFPE mCRC tumor samples from 
160 slides and 29 shavings.
Reverse transcription
MiR-31-3p expression was quantified using FFPE-extracted 
RNAs via RT followed by real-time qPCR. Reverse tran-
scription reactions contained 30 ng of total RNA including 
either the miRNA or different quantities of the reference 
standard (see above), stem-loop RT primer miR-31-3p/miR-
calibrator, RT buffer, 0.25 mM of each deoxynucleotide 
(dNTP) Solution Mix, 3.33 U/µL of MultiScribe Reverse 
Transcriptase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), 
and 0.25 U/µL of the ribonuclease inhibitor from the TaqMan 
MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). 
The 15-µL reactions were incubated in an 9700 Thermal 
Cycler (Applied Biosystems) or SimpliAMP Thermal Cycler 
(Applied Biosystems) for 30 minutes at 16°C, 30 minutes at 
42°C, 5 minutes at 85°C, and then held at 4°C.
qPCR step
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed 
using a standard TaqMan PCR protocol on ABI 7900HT, 
StepOnePlus, QuantStudio 5 (Applied Biosystems) or the 
LightCycler 480 Instrument II (Roche Diagnostics, 
Pleasanton, CA, USA). The 15-µL PCR included 2.7-µL 
complementary DNA RT product, TaqMan Universal PCR 
Master Mix, no UNG (Applied Biosystems), and TaqMan 
Small RNA Assay (Applied Biosystems). The reactions were 
incubated in a plate at 95°C for 10 minutes, followed by 40 
cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds and 60°C for 1 minute. All reac-
tions, including no-template controls (NTCs), were run in 
duplicate.
Data analysis
Data analysis for instruments from Applied Biosystems was 
performed using the instrument’s qPCR software set at auto-
matic mode as the baseline. The threshold was manually con-
figured to 0.2 for both miR-31-3p and the miR-calibrator 
(Y-axis is logarithmic scale). Data analysis for the LightCycler 
480 Instrument II was performed using the second derivative 
method with the baseline and threshold set automatically.
Expression levels were normalized using the Human Brain 
Total RNA via the ∆∆Ct method. The difference between 
miR-31-3p Ct and the miR-calibrator Ct for each sample was 
compared with the difference between miR-31-3p Ct and the 
miR-calibrator Ct of the Human Brain Total RNA standard. 
This method enabled the determination of the relative quanti-
fication (RQ) for miR-31-3p expression. RQ was calculated 
using the following formulas:

Cutoff determination
The cutoff value for determining high versus low miR-
31-3p expressers was established using tumor samples from 
a cohort of 189 patients with RAS WT mCRC enrolled in 
a phase 3 prospective, randomized trial designed to assess 
the benefits of adding the anti-EGFR agent, panitumumab 
plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in second-
line treatment of mCRC.24,26 The cutoff was determined 
based on the identification of a threshold value for miR-
31-3p expression in this patient cohort where a differential 
treatment effect between low miR-31-3p expression and 
high miR-31-3p expression patient populations was 
observed regarding progression-free survival (PFS). Five 
quantiles of miR-31-3p expression levels from the 60th to 
80th percentiles were tested as a threshold to define 2 sub-
groups of subjects with miR-31-3p expression level above 
and below the quantile. To assess the relevance of each 
quantile value as a potential cutoff, treatment hazard ratios 
with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated 
separately for each of the 2 subgroups using Cox model 
adjusted for BRAF mutational status, and the homogeneity 
of treatment effect was tested across the subgroups through 
an interaction test.
PCR efficiency and linearity
Polymerase chain reaction efficiency and linearity were 
assessed using a range of sample quantities of human brain 
total RNA (200, 100, 50, 0.5, 0.05, 0.005, and 0.0005 ng) in 
the RT reaction. The acceptance criteria for PCR efficiency 
were 90% to 110% for each assay, corresponding to a slope of 
−3.6 to −3.1. The acceptance criteria for linearity were (a) a 
slope of −3.6 to −3.1, (b) a constant ∆∆Ct mean value with a 
maximum variation of 10%, and (c) a r2 ≥ 0.99 for each indi-
vidual assay standard curve. Two curves were obtained, one 
for each miRNA assay.
Analytical sensitivity (limit of detection and limit 
of quantification)
The limit of detection and limit of quantification for the test 
was assessed using 7 differing quantities of human brain total 
RNA (200, 100, 50, 0.5, 0.05, 0.005, and 0.0005 ng). The limit 
of detection was defined as the lowest quantity detected above 
the NTC. The limit of quantification was defined as the small-
est amount of the miRNAs detectable and quantifiable within 
the linearity range.

Analytical specificity
The analytical specificity for the miR-31-3p quantification 
method was determined by assessing the ability of the qPCR 
assay to detect the appropriate target sequence for miR-31-3p 
compared with miR-31-5p. miR-31-5p is a nonspecific target 
that can be found in FFPE tumor samples from patients with 
mCRC and can be cotranscribed with miR-31-3p.
Intrareproducibility (repeatability)
Repeatability of the miR-31-3p method was assessed by ana-
lyzing the same samples several times. Intrareproducibility was 
determined for 2 RNA samples by measuring miR-31-3p 
expression after undergoing 8 RT reactions for each sample. 
The first sample was known to correspond with low miR-
31-3p expression (Ct miR-31-3p > 30 Ct) and the second sam-
ple was known to correspond to high miR-31-3p expression 
(Ct miR-31-3p < 28 Ct). The qPCR was performed on the 
same PCR plate.
Interreproducibility (reproducibility)
Interreproducibility was measured by conducting 8 separate 
RT reactions, each performed on 2 RNA samples similar to the 
intrareproducibility (repeatability) studies referred to above. 
The qPCR testing was performed at 2 different laboratories by 
2 different operators.
Interreproducibility was also measured using 10 separate 
FFPE shaving samples from tumors with each of the sam-
ples undergoing RNA extraction and run at 2 different labs. 
The RQ values and standard deviation were calculated across 
intrarun replicates. For the first lab (R&D laboratory), 
approximately 15 mg of biological material was used in 
extraction process. RNA extraction was performed using the 
miRNeasy kit extraction and a commercial deparaffinization 
solution (Qiagen) with automated extraction using a 
QIAcube (Qiagen). Real-time PCR was performed using a 
StepOnePlus (Applied Biosystems). For the second lab 
(clinical reference lab), approximately 50 mg of biological 
material was used in extraction process. RNA extraction was 
performed using the AllPrep DNA/RNA FFPE kit extrac-
tion with extraction/deparaffinization completed using a 
Xylene solution using a manual extraction method. Real-
time PCR was performed using a LightCycler 480 II (Roche 
Diagnostics).
Finally, interreproducibility was assessed by measuring miR-
31-3p expression from samples at differing time intervals 
between 18 and 24 months. MiR-31-3p expression levels were 
determined for RNA extracted from 157 FFPE tumor samples 
initially (in triplicate) and then after 18 to 24 months by the 
same laboratory technician using the same qPCR equipment 
(7900HT). A standard Bland–Altman plot was used as a 
method of choice for measuring agreement between the 2 
quantifications.27
Robustness
The qPCR reactions were run with 2 samples with each sam-
ple having differing level of miR-31-3p expression. The fol-
lowing operating conditions were varied: (a) qPCR reactions 
were performed with varying annealing/synthesis tempera-
tures of 59°C, 60°C (standard conditions), and 61°C; (b) 
qPCR was performed with 80% of Master Mix; and (c) qPCR 
was performed with Master Mix stored at different tempera-
tures including −20°C, 4°C (normal condition), and at room 
temperature.
Accuracy
Accuracy was tested via the standard addition method. 
Three known copy numbers of miR-31-3p, specifically 15, 
150, and 1500 copies (custom-manufactured miRNA: 
UGCUAUG CCAACAUAUUGCCAU; Exiqon A/S, 
Vedbaek, Denmark) were added to 4 low-content RNA 
samples in RT reaction. The calculated miR-31-3p copy 
numbers added to the qPCR reactions were 3, 30, and 300 
copies. Based on the above, the final measured RQ was 
expected to increase 10-fold for each sample in line with the 
increasing copy number.
qPCR system comparison
The potential impact of differing qPCR platforms on miR-
31-3p expression quantification was tested using RNA 
extracted from 6 FFPE tumor samples tested in duplicate. Six 
clinical specimens with known miR-31-3p expression levels 
were tested on 4 different qPCR instruments including an ABI 
7900HT, 2 separate StepOnePlus machines installed in 2 dif-
ferent laboratories, and a QuantStudio 5. A standard Bland–
Altman plot and correlation coefficient were used to measure 
the agreement in results obtained from the 4 qPCR 
instruments.27
Results
miR-calibrator selection and expression stability
Following a literature review and analysis of microarray data 
from FFPE mCRC tumor samples, several potential miRNA 
reference candidates were identified. Validation via RT-qPCR 
testing was performed (data not shown) to ensure stability of 
the reference miRNAs across differing mCRC tumor tissue 
samples. This included 160 FFPE tumor samples obtained 
from slides and 29 samples from shavings. The most stable 
miRNA reference (miR-calibrator) was selected based on the 
results of these studies. The miR-calibrator selected had the 
lowest standard deviation of all miRNA reference candidates 
tested, with an SD of 0.72 for FFPE slides and 0.99 for FFPE 
shavings. Figure 1 shows the Ct distribution for the selected 
miR-calibrator obtained from FFPE samples from both slides 
and shavings.

Cutoff determination
A cutoff value for miR-31-3p expression level was defined to 
enable the identification of 2 subgroups of patients with mCRC 
with differential anti-EGFR treatment effect. Five quantiles of 
miR-31-3p expression levels from the 60th to 80th percentiles 
were tested as a threshold to define 2 subgroups of subjects with 
miR-31-3p expression level above and below the quantile. For 
each of the threshold quantiles tested, anti-EGFR therapy was 
beneficial in terms of PFS for patients with low miR-31-3p 
expression but not for subjects with high expression (Figure 2A). 
This differential treatment effect for “low” versus “high” express-
ers was maximal when the subgroups were defined using the 80th 
percentile as a threshold, indicating a predictive value of miR-
31-3p. To maintain a reasonable sample size for each subgroup, 
the 70th percentile, corresponding to a miR-31-3p expression 
RQ of 1.36 compared with the reference sample, was selected as 
the cutoff because the P value for the interaction test became 
inferior to 0.2 between the 70th and the 75th percentiles (Figure 
2B) and the hazard ratio point estimate in high expressers became 
greater than 1, suggesting a lack of benefit of anti-EGFR therapy 
in the 30% of subjects with higher miR-31-3p expression.
PCR efficiency and linearity
Based on the mean values for slope and r2 across 2 runs for miR-
31-3p and the housekeeping miRNA, the average PCR efficiency 
and linearity across 2 runs met the predefined PCR efficacy (90% 
to 110%, slope −3.6 to −3.1) and coefficient of determination 
(r2 ≥ 0.99) requirements for the range (0.05-200 ng) of reference 
human brain RNA tested (see Table 2 and Figure 3).

Biomarker Insights 
Analytical sensitivity (limit of detection and limit 
of quantification)
Amplification was seen for both miR-31-3p and the miR-cal-
ibrator for all concentrations except 0.005 ng total RNA. As a 
result, only 6 of the 7 data points were used for calculations. 
None of the NTC PCR reactions showed positive amplifica-
tion plots. Our results indicate that the limit of quantification 
for miR-31-3p and the miR-calibrator was 0.05 ng of total 
RNA, below which results are not reproducibly stable.
Analytical specificity
There was no crossreactivity (no significant change miR-31-3p 
Ct) for any of the samples where miR-31-5p was added (Table 3). 
Fluorescent signal generated during real-time PCR was not 
affected by miR-31-5p spiking, confirming the specificity of 
miR-31-3p method.
Intrareproducibility (repeatability)
Intrareproducibility for 2 RNA samples extracted was meas-
ured from 8 RTs of the same RNA samples with one sample 
corresponding to a low miR-31-3p expression and the other 
sample corresponding to a high miR-31-3p expression. One 
replicate (RT8) for the sample with low expression was not 
considered for subsequent analysis because the difference 
between the 2 Ct values for the duplicates did not conform to 
the acceptance criteria. Evaluation of the mean RQ and stand-
ard deviation showed SD values of 0.03 (coefficient of varia-
tion [CV] = 18.9%) for the low miR-31-3p expressers and 0.28 
(CV = 5.8%) for the high miR-31-3p expressers (Table 4). 
These results demonstrate a low deviation from the mean for 
all samples suggesting low intra-assay variability.
Interreproducibility (reproducibility)
Interrun reproducibility studies demonstrated that the miR-
31-3p expression test had a high degree of precision with no 
significant interassay variability. The bias between 2 sets of 
measurements for 8 RTs from 2 different RNA samples 
obtained from FFPE slides was lower than the standard devia-
tion, thus confirming no interassay variability (Table 5). The 
standard deviation for results obtained from 2 separate RNA 
extractions run in duplicate from 10 separate FFPE-extracted 
RNA samples ranged from 0.07 to 1.61 (Table 6). Of note is 
that only samples with an RQ of more than 2.53 had an SD 
value greater than 1. For paired FFPE samples run between 18 
and 24 months, 93.6% had a standard deviation of less than 1 
(Figure 4). The Bland–Altman analysis showed narrow limits 
Figure 3. Polymerase chain reaction efficiency and linearity for miR-31-3p and miR-calibrator. Each point represents the mean Ct across 2 runs. The 
calculation was based on 6 data points instead of 7 data points as no amplification was seen for miR-31-3p at 0.005 ng total RNA. Ct indicates cycle 
threshold.

of agreement with respect to RT-qPCR variability (bias is 
extended from +2 to −2 SDs).
Robustness
The miR-31-3p quantification was determined to be highly 
robust based on RQ results from samples run in duplicate 
across a variety of operating conditions (Figure 5).
Accuracy
Samples containing 3 added copies of miR-31-3p were below 
the detection limit (Ct > 37). The RQs measured for the sam-
ples with 300 added copies, compared with the samples with 30 
added copies, were in line with the expected 10-fold increase 
(average RQ = 9.37; 95% CI: 8.15-10.53; n = 8).
qPCR system comparison
There was a very high concordance (r2 > 0.98) for the results 
obtained for the miR-31-3p quantification assay between the 
4 qPCR platforms tested (Table 7). A single sample (S5) with 
a mean RQ of 24.74 demonstrated significant variability 
across the various platforms. Because the cutoff separating low 
versus high expressers of miR-31-3p is an RQ 1.36, it was 
concluded that the significant variability for samples with a 
high RQ would not affect the determination of clinical miR-
31-3p expresser status and sample S5 was not included in the 
analysis below.
The mean bias, standard deviation, and CIs from the com-
parison of results between the 4 qPCR platforms tested are 
shown in Table 8. The bias of the qPCR platforms associated 
with the measurement of miR-31-3p expression ranged from 
−0.47 (the lower limit of the bias interval between the 
StepOnePlus [Platform 2] and the QuantStudio5 [Platform 
4]) to +0.64 (the higher limit of the bias interval between the 
StepOnePlus [Platform 2] and the 7900HT [Platform 3]). The 
Bland–Altman analysis showed narrow limits of agreement 
with respect to equipment variabilities (bias is extended from +2 
to −2 SDs). Test results demonstrated an excellent correlation 
and a low equipment bias for low RQ values up to and including 
the RQ 1.36 cutoff value.
Discussion
Our data demonstrate that the quantification of miR-31-3p 
expression using the standardized RT-qPCR assay described 
above is feasible, sensitive, specific, and reproducible. The assay 
was developed and validated to enable the relative quantifica-
tion of miR-31-3p expression in FFPE tumor samples from 
primary tumors of patients with mCRC.
The performance of the assay was also validated in 5 sepa-
rate lab settings using differing qPCR systems and lab techni-
cians under a variety of operating conditions. Our results 
demonstrate that there was no significant bias in test results 
between the differing qPCR platforms tested. Based on these 
findings, running this miR-31-3p expression quantification 
assay on the systems tested is acceptable for clinical practice.
Acceptable RT-qPCR results were obtained from FFPE 
tissue samples obtained from both slides and shavings with the 
amount of material required to perform the assay in line with 
what is typically available for clinical testing from the intended 
patient population. The requirement for routine RAS testing 
of primary tumors from patients with mCRC also facilitates 
the availability of the appropriate FFPE tissue samples for run-
ning the miR-31-3p quantification assay.
Several authors have recently reported the ability of miR-
31-3p expression to predict response to anti-EGFR therapy for 
patients with RAS WT mCRC.23–25 From a clinical interpreta-
tion perspective, patients with RAS WT mCRC whose tumors 
have a low expression of miR-31-3p (RQ < 1.36) experience an 
improved response to anti-EGFR therapy when used in first-
line when compared with anti-VEGF therapy.25 Low miR-
31-3p expressers also have a better response to anti-EGFR 
therapy versus chemotherapy alone when used for second or 
further lines of treatment.23,24 The patients with RAS WT

mCRC whose tumors have a high expression of miR-31-3p 
(RQ ≥ 1.36) have a similar response to first-line anti-EGFR 
and anti-VEGF therapy.25 High miR-31-3p expressors also 
have a better response to chemotherapy alone versus anti-
EGFR therapy when used for second or further lines of treat-
ment.23,24 A recent prospective-retrospective study of 370 
patients with KRAS WT mCRC which assessed miR-31-3p 
expression using the above cutoff reported that 66.2% of FFPE 
samples tested had low miR-31-3p expression and 33.8% of 
the samples tested had high miR-31-3p expression.25 The 
assay described herein will enable the ability to differentiate 
low and high miR-31-3p–expressing primary tumors enabling 
clinicians to further personalize the use of anti-EGFR therapy 
in this patient population.
Based on the results of our validation studies for the miR-
31-3p quantification assay, samples which meet all the accept-
ance criteria (Table 9) can be interpreted as having either low 
or high miR expression level based on their RQ. Result of the 
assay can be considered “indeterminate” if no RQ value is 
obtained or if acceptance criteria are not met.

Biomarker Insights 
There are several potential limitations to our studies. The 
accuracy data we report are preliminary and additional vali-
dation studies are needed to compare the results we obtain 
with other techniques or through the introduction of a syn-
thetic standard curve. Also, although the TaqMan probes we 
selected were chosen as they have reduced crossreactivity and 
increased specificity, we have not conducted specificity stud-
ies for additional miRNAs which have similar sequences to 
miR-31-3p.
The data from this study provide evidence as to the feasibil-
ity of quantifying the expression of miR-31-3p from FFPE 
tumor tissue using a standardized RT-qPCR assay. The results 
from this test demonstrate both reproducibility and robustness 
across differing sample types, testing conditions, and qPCR 
platforms. This method provides a sensitive, specific, and ana-
lytically precise assay for the clinical measurement of miR-
31-3p from FFPE tumor samples.
