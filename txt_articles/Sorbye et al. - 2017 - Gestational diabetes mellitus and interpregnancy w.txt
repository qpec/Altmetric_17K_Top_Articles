Abstract
Background
Being overweight is an important risk factor for Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM), but the
underlying mechanisms are not understood. Weight change between pregnancies has been
suggested to be an independent mechanism behind GDM. We assessed the risk for GDM in
second pregnancy by change in Body Mass Index (BMI) from first to second pregnancy and
whether BMI and gestational weight gain modified the risk.
Methods and findings
In this observational cohort, we included 24,198 mothers and their 2 first pregnancies in
data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway (2006–2014). Weight change, defined as
prepregnant BMI in second pregnancy minus prepregnant BMI in first pregnancy, was
divided into 6 categories by units BMI (kilo/square meter). Relative risk (RR) estimates were
obtained by general linear models for the binary family and adjusted for maternal age at sec-
ond delivery, country of birth, education, smoking in pregnancy, interpregnancy interval, and
year of second birth. Analyses were stratified by BMI (first pregnancy) and gestational
weight gain (second pregnancy). Compared to women with stable BMI (−1 to 1), women
who gained weight between pregnancies had higher risk of GDM—gaining 1 to 2 units:
adjusted RR 2.0 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.7), 2 to 4 units: RR 2.6 (2.0 to 3.5), and �4 units: RR 5.4
(4.0 to 7.4). Risk increased significantly both for women with BMI below and above 25 at first
pregnancy, although it increased more for the former group. A limitation in our study was the
limited data on BMI in 2 pregnancies.
Conclusions
The risk of GDM increased with increasing weight gain from first to second pregnancy, and
more strongly among women with BMI < 25 in first pregnancy. Our results suggest weight
change as a metabolic mechanism behind the increased risk of GDM, thus weight change
should be acknowledged as an independent factor for screening GDM in clinical guidelines.

Author summary
Why was this study done?
• Being overweight during pregnancy is an important risk factor for Gestational Diabetes
Mellitus (GDM); however, the underlying mechanisms are not clear.
• Recent evidence has found that women who increase their weight from first to second
pregnancy increase the risk of GDM, suggesting weight as a causal mechanism behind
GDM.
• Research is not consistent on whether the association is dependent on the woman’s
weight status when she enters her first pregnancy.
What did the researchers do and find?
• In this observational cohort study, we used data from the population-based Medical
Birth Registry of Norway and included 24,198 mothers with their first and second preg-
nancy during 2006–2014.
• We investigated if a change in Body Mass Index (BMI) between first and second preg-
nancy affected the risk of GDM in the second pregnancy and if the association was
dependent on the woman’s prepregnant BMI in first pregnancy
• The risk of GDM in second pregnancy increased with increasing weight gain between
pregnancies, and more strongly among women who had a BMI below 25 (kilo/meters
squared) in first pregnancy.
• Decreasing BMI by >2 units from first to second pregnancy had a preventive effect on
GDM in overweight and obese women.
What do these findings mean?
• Weight gain between pregnancies should be evaluated as an independent risk factor for
screening GDM in clinical antenatal guidelines.
• Our results need to be replicated in other populations, and they underline the impor-
tance of future research on pathophysiologic mechanisms behind the development of
GDM.
• Efforts to promote healthy weight in the reproductive population need to expand their
focus to include healthy maternal weight from preconception throughout reproduction.

 Introduction
Worldwide, overweight has reached epidemic proportions [1, 2], with serious consequences
for reproductive health. Being overweight during pregnancy increases the risk of complica-
tions in pregnancy, in childbirth, and for the newborn child [3–7] and is an important risk
factor for Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) [8–11]. GDM is defined as glucose intoler-
ance of various degrees that is first detected during pregnancy [12], and the prevalence of
GDM has increased, with variation by countries [11, 13–15]. GDM increases the risk of
immediate adverse pregnancy and infant outcomes [16] and, in the long term, the risk of
metabolic syndrome and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in the mothers [17–19]. Children born to
GDM mothers have an increased risk of high birthweight and being overweight in adoles-
cence [20].
The underlying genetic, physiological, and environmental factors behind the development
of GDM are not fully understood [12, 21]. Both prepregnant Body Mass Index (BMI) and ges-
tational weight gain are risk factors for GDM, but evidence of an independent or joint effect is
inconsistent [22–24]. Most observational studies have not been able to evaluate shared genetic
and early environmental risk factors within families. Recent studies have suggested interpreg-
nancy weight change as part of the causal mechanism behind the risk of GDM and other
adverse pregnancy outcomes in the second pregnancy; however, knowledge of this is scarce
[25–27]. It has also been suggested that the effect of interpregnancy weight change may depend
on the woman’s prepregnant BMI during her first pregnancy [25–27]. One study found that
women gaining weight between their first and second pregnancy increased their risk for GDM
in their second pregnancy, even though they were normal weight during both pregnancies
[25]. Previous studies have not been able to study the importance of gestational weight gain
upon this association. We estimated the association between prepregnancy BMI changes from
the first to the second pregnancy and GDM in the second pregnancy for women giving birth
in Norway. Secondly, we explored the roles of prepregnant BMI in first pregnancy and gesta-
tional weight gain in second pregnancy as effect modifiers.
Methods
Data sources
This observational cohort study complies with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki.
The project was approved by the Regional Ethics Committee, REK VEST (2015/1728). Infor-
med consent was not required as data were de-identified, and the researchers did not have any
additional patient contact. We used prospectively collected data from the population-based
Medical Birth Registry of Norway (MBRN) [28]. Using the unique national identification
number, each child born was linked to his/her mother, so that each record consisted of the
mother and her successive 2 first births (2006–2014). The MBRN was established in 1967 and
is based on compulsory notification of all live- and stillbirths from 16 weeks of gestation (12
weeks from 2002). Midwives and doctors attending the birth complete a standardized notifica-
tion form on demographics, maternal health before and during pregnancy, previous reproduc-
tive history, complications during pregnancy and delivery, and pregnancy outcomes [29].
Data on maternal height and weight prior to conception are self-reported. Weight at the end
of pregnancy is defined as maternal weight measured at last antenatal visit or when arriving at
the delivery ward. The collection of maternal height and weight information in MBRN began
in 2006 when Norway adopted a revised electronic birth notification system, but the imple-
mentation of the system by all delivery units was not complete until 2014. The proportion of

 registered maternal height and weight in MBRN steadily increased from 0.1% in 2006 to 71.6%
of births in 2014 [S1 Fig]. Complete data on prepregnancy height and weight is available for
24% of the women having their first 2 deliveries during 2006–2014. During this period, the dis-
tribution of women across the different BMI categories has been stable over time, suggesting
that even in years with low reporting, the data are likely representative for the population [30].
Data on country of birth (Nordic defined as Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and Iceland)
was obtained from The National Population Registry, Statistics Norway. Maternal education,
defined as the highest achieved years of education classified according to The Norwegian Stan-
dard Classification of Education, was obtained from the National Education Database, Statis-
tics Norway.
Inclusions and definitions
Fig 1 shows a flow chart of the included and excluded women in the study.
Prepregnant BMI was calculated from weight in kilograms (kg) divided by height in meters
squared (m2). Our main exposure was interpregnancy weight change defined as prepregnant
BMI in second pregnancy minus prepregnant BMI in first pregnancy. Gestational weight gain in
second pregnancy was calculated as weight (kg) at the end of pregnancy minus prepregnant
weight. A total of 105,429 women delivered their first 2 births during 2006–2014. To be included,
women had to have prepregnancy height and weight reported for both pregnancies (n = 24,677).

 We excluded women with prepregnant BMI below 15 (n = 11) and interpregnancy weight
change above +30 and below −30 BMI units (kg/m2) (n = 3), as they were considered implausi-
ble. To evaluate first-time occurrence of GDM in the second pregnancy, women diagnosed with
GDM in their first pregnancy were excluded (n = 329). In the analyses exploring the potential
effect modifying role of gestational weight gain in second pregnancy, only women who had their
weight registered both before and at the end of their second pregnancy were included in the
analysis (n = 11,972). A weight gain above 70 kg during second pregnancy was considered
implausible (n = 6)
We categorized prepregnancy BMI into underweight (<18.5), normal weight (18.5–24.9),
overweight (25–29.9), and obese (�30) [31]. Prepregnant BMI in first pregnancy was further
dichotomized into <25 kg/m2 versus �25 kg/m2 for stratified analyses. We categorized inter-
pregnancy weight change into 6 groups: <−2, −2 to <−1, −1 to <1 (reference), 1 to <2, 2 to
<4, and �4 kg/m2[26, 27]. Gestational weight gain was grouped into the following: weight
loss, 0–7.9 kg, 8–15.9 kg, and �16 kg [32]. In stratified analyses, women with a weight loss
were excluded, and gestational weight gain was dichotomized by the median value: 0–13.9 kg
and �14 kg. The main outcome was GDM (yes/no), notified by a check box on the birth notifi-
cation form or as free text coded at the MBRN according to the International Classification of
Diseases (ICD) version 10. The diagnostic criteria and screening strategy for GDM are given
in the national guidelines for antenatal care and obstetrics made by the Norwegian Society of
Gynecology and Obstetrics (in 1998, 2008, and 2014) [33]. GDM is diagnosed when fasting
plasma glucose levels are <7.0 millimole (mmol)/liter (l) and serum blood glucose following
an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (2 hours after intake of 75 grams oral glucose) is �7.8
mmol/l but <11.1 mmol/l. Women follow a standardized antenatal program with regular
visits, which include urine stix testing for glucose at each visit. Independent of gestational
week, an OGTT is recommended when the stix is positive (�+++). Women with risk factors
(age > 38 years, close relatives with Gestational Diabetes type 1/2, immigrants from the Indian
Subcontinent or North Africa, prepregnant BMI > 27 kg/m2, or prior GDM) will be offered
an OGTT as early as possible in pregnancy, and if negative, it will be repeated in week 28–30
[33].
Maternal smoking habits were reported at the end of pregnancy, and women could answer
“no,” “occasionally,” “daily,” or they could decline to answer (n = 2,592). Daily and occasional
smokers (n = 110) were considered smokers. Interpregnancy interval was calculated as the date
of the second birth minus the date of first birth minus the pregnancy length of the second preg-
nancy, and it was categorized into <12, 12 to <24 (reference), 24 to <36, and �36 months. In
stratified analyses, the interpregnancy interval was dichotomized: <24 and �24 months. The
gestational age of the second pregnancy was based on second trimester ultrasound estimations
or, if missing, on the mother’s last menstrual period.
Statistics
Chi-square tests were used to investigate associations and linear trends between variables.
General linear models with extension for the binary family were used to estimate the associa-
tion between interpregnancy weight change from the first to second pregnancy and the risk of
GDM in the second pregnancy. Relative risks (RRs) with 95% CI were calculated for interpreg-
nancy weight-change categories. Maternal age at second delivery (<25, 25–29, 30–34, �35
years), country of birth (Nordic/non-Nordic), highest achieved years of education (<11, 11–
14, �14 years), smoking during pregnancy (yes/no), interpregnancy interval (<12, 12 to <24,
24 to <36, �36 months), and year of the second birth (continuous variable) were considered
as possible confounders [34] and were adjusted for in the multivariable binary regression

 model. The presented adjusted models (n = 20,824) had missing information on covariates in
3,374 (13.9%) women. Missing values for smoking, maternal education, and maternal country
of birth were therefore handled by missing imputation using chained equations (MICE) with
logistic regression for smoking and maternal country of birth and multinomial logistic regres-
sion for maternal education [35] [S1 Table]. When evaluating a potential effect modification
by prepregnant BMI in the first pregnancy (BMI < 25 and BMI � 25), and gestational weight
gain (<14 and �14) in the second pregnancy, we included an interaction term in the multipli-
cative model evaluated by Likelihood ratio test. To compare the risk of GDM in women with
BMI � 25 and BMI < 25 in the first pregnancy, we included interpregnancy BMI change as a
continuous variable in the interaction term (Likelihood ratio test, Poisson regression). Associ-
ations were considered statistically significant at the 5% level. All statistical analyses were per-
formed using STATA IC Statistical software version 14 and Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences, version 23 (www.spss.com).
Results
A total of 24,198 mothers were included in the main analysis. Of these, 12,078 (50%) women
had information on gestational weight gain (GWG) in their second pregnancy and were
included in the analysis evaluating effect modification by GWG. Population characteristics by
GDM in second pregnancy are shown in Table 1.
The overall absolute risk of GDM in second pregnancy was 18.1 per 1,000 pregnancies
(439/24,198), and the prevalence of GDM increased with increasing level of prepregnant BMI
in second pregnancy (p for trend <0.001). Interpregnancy weight change from the first to sec-
ond pregnancy was relatively stable (−1 to <1 BMI units) in 47.6% of women (n = 11,512),
while 16.8% (n = 4,076) of women had a weight loss of >1 BMI unit and 35.6% (n = 8,610) of
women gained weight �1 BMI unit. To evaluate the representativeness of our study popula-
tion, we compared the study population with the general population in MBRN during 2006–
2014 [S10 Table].
During the second pregnancy, 0.8% (100/12,078) of women lost weight (<0 kg), 10.5% had
a GWG of 0 kg to 7.9 kg, 53.7% had a GWG of 8 kg to 15.9 kg, and 34.9% had a GWG of �16
kg. Overall, we found a negative correlation between interpregnancy weight change (kg/m2)
and gestational weight gain (kg) in second pregnancy (r −0.20, p < 0.001, n = 12,078). For
each BMI unit increase from the first to second pregnancy, gestational weight gain in the sec-
ond pregnancy decreased by 0.53 kg (β: −0.53, 95% CI: −0.58 to −0.49).
Interpregnancy weight change and GDM in second pregnancy
Overall, the risk of GDM in the second pregnancy increased with increasing interpregnancy
weight gain between the first and second pregnancy [Fig 2] [Table 2].
Women who gained between 1 and 2 BMI units (kg/m2) had a doubled risk (adjusted [a]
RR 2.0, 95% CI: 1.5–2.7), women gaining between 2 and 4 units had a 2.6x risk (a RR 2.6, 95%
CI: 2.0–3.5), and women gaining �4 BMI units had a 5-fold risk of GDM in second pregnancy
(a RR 5.4, 95% CI: 4.0–7.4) compared to women with stable interpregnancy weight (–1 to <1).
The adjusted model with and without missing imputation can be seen in [S1 Table].
Prepregnant BMI in first pregnancy, interpregnancy weight change, and
GDM
In stratified analyses by prepregnant BMI in the first pregnancy, the risk estimates for GDM
increased with increasing weight gain between pregnancies and were stronger in women with
BMI < 25 in the first pregnancy [Fig 3] [S2 Table]. Women who were overweight (BMI � 25)

 in their first pregnancy and who reduced their BMI by �2 units prior to their second preg-
nancy, had a 60% lower risk of GDM in the second pregnancy [a RR 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2–0.8].
Results from the different adjusted models with and without missing imputation are seen in
[S3 Table]. When excluding second pregnancies with gestational age below 37 weeks, multiple
pregnancies and hypertensive disorders (hypertension during pregnancy, preeclampsia, eclamp-
sia, and Hemolysis Elevated Liver enzymes and Low Platelet counts [HELLP]) (n = 1,755), results
remained unchanged [S4 Table]. The prevalence of GDM in second pregnancy was significantly
higher in non-Nordic compared to Nordic women (2.9% versus 1.6%, p < 0.001) [Table 1].
When we stratified the analysis by the mother’s country of birth [S5 Table] and maternal age [S6
Table], the association between interpregnancy weight change and GDM in the second preg-
nancy remained unchanged. Stratifying the analyses by interpregnancy interval (<24 and �24
months) revealed a stronger association between interpregnancy weight gain and GDM in
women with an interval below 24 months [S7 Table] (p = 0.001 for interaction, Likelihood-ratio
test, n = 20,824).

 There was a significant interaction between prepregnant BMI (<25 and �25) in the first
pregnancy and interpregnancy weight change (p = 0.009, Likelihood-ratio test). To test if the
association between interpregnancy weight gain and GDM was stronger in women with
BMI < 25 in their first pregnancy, we excluded women with interpregnancy weight change
<−1 unit (n = 4,076) and added interpregnancy weight change as a continuous variable in the
interaction term. Likelihood-ratio test confirmed the heterogeneity in risk (p < 0.001, Poisson
regression analysis). To compare the risk of GDM in the second pregnancy in women with

 prepregnant BMI in their first pregnancy below or above 25 in 1 model, we included both
groups in the same model using women with stable BMI (−1 to <1 BMI unit) and a prepreg-
nant BMI < 25 in their first pregnancy as the common reference category. Having BMI � 25
in the first pregnancy was associated with a higher risk of GDM across all interpregnancy
weight change categories when compared to women in the reference group [Fig 4].
The role of prepregnant BMI in second pregnancy
We defined prepregnant BMI in the second pregnancy as part of the exposure and the effect
that we wished to study; therefore, we did not adjust for BMI in the second pregnancy. In
order to find out if the association between interpregnancy weight change and GDM was inde-
pendent of BMI in second pregnancy, we analyzed women who had prepregnant BMI below
25 both in their first and second pregnancy (n = 14,857) and found the same trend [S8 Table].
In this population, 0.8% (n = 118) developed GDM during the second pregnancy. When strati-
fying the analyses according to BMI in second pregnancy (n = 24,198), the association between
interpregnancy weight gain and GDM remained [S9 Table].

 Gestational weight gain in second pregnancy, interpregnancy weight
change, and GDM
Overall, we found an inverse linear association between gestational weight gain and GDM in
second pregnancy (p for trend <0.001). After excluding women with negative gestational
weight gain, the crude RR of GDM in the second pregnancy of women with gestational weight
gain 0–13.9 kg was 2.0 (95% CI: 1.5–2.7), compared to women with �14 kg (n = 11,972).
When we adjusted for prepregnant BMI in second pregnancy and confounders in our model,
the RR of GDM in women with gestational weight gain 0–13.9 kg compared to women with
�14 kg, was 1.9 (95% CI: 1.4–2.5). Testing for an interaction between gestational weight gain
(0–13.9 and �14 kg) in the second pregnancy and interpregnancy weight change in a binary
regression model gave a nonsignificant interaction term (p = 0.822, Likelihood-ratio test,
n = 9,978). When we assessed the risk of GDM by interpregnancy weight change in strata of
gestational weight gain in second pregnancy, we confirmed the positive association in both
groups. The strongest association was found in women gaining �14 kg in their second preg-
nancy, although estimates were not significantly different [Table 3].
Discussion
Principal findings
We found a higher risk of GDM in women who increased their weight by �1 BMI unit from their
first to second pregnancy compared to women with stable weight (−1 to <1 unit change). The risk
estimates for GDM increased with increasing weight gain and applied to both normal-weight (pre-
pregnant BMI < 25) and overweight (prepregnant BMI � 25) women in their first pregnancy.
Women with a BMI < 25 in their first pregnancy had the strongest association between interpreg-
nancy weight gain and GDM. A preventive effect on GDM was seen in overweight women (first
pregnancy) who reduced their weight by �2 BMI units until the second pregnancy.
Interpregnancy weight change, BMI in first pregnancy, and the risk of
GDM
Previous studies on interpregnancy weight change and risk of GDM are generally consistent
with our findings with some exceptions [25, 36–39]. A Swedish population-based study found

 that the risk for GDM in the second pregnancy increased linearly with interpregnancy weight
gain and was also present in women whose BMI was <25 in both pregnancies [25], consistent
with our results. However, for overweight and obese women (BMI > 25 in first pregnancy),
they found that only those with a large interpregnancy weight gain of �3 BMI units had an
increased risk of GDM [25]. A regional cohort study from Belgium found an increased risk of
GDM in women who had an interpregnancy weight gain of �1 BMI unit but only among
women with BMI < 25 in their first pregnancy[37]. An American study also found, as we did,
that the risk of GDM associated with interpregnancy weight gain applied both to women with
BMI below and above 25 in first pregnancy. The risk estimates were also higher in women
who had BMI < 25 in their first pregnancy, similar to our results [36].
We found a preventive effect of losing weight �2 BMI units from first to second pregnancy
in women who had BMI � 25 in first pregnancy, when compared to women with stable BMI
in this group. Some studies have confirmed this [36, 38, 39], while others have not found any
preventive effect of reducing weight on the risk of GDM [25, 37].
Gestational weight gain and GDM
Obese women tend to gain less weight during pregnancy and also have the highest baseline
risk of GDM; therefore, it is important to take BMI into consideration when examining gesta-
tional weight gain and GDM. We found the highest risk of GDM in women who had the low-
est gestational weight gain, which has been confirmed in other studies [22, 37]. Reverse
causation is a possible explanation, as women with GDM are closely monitored and receive
advice on nutrition and physical activity, which may lead to lower gestational weight gain dur-
ing the second pregnancy. Few studies have included gestational weight gain during second
pregnancy when exploring the association between interpregnancy weight change and GDM.
A study from Belgium found that inadequate gestational weight gain in second pregnancy was
associated with GDM both in women who were normal weight or overweight in their first
pregnancy [37].
Pathophysiological mechanisms behind GDM
GDM is characterized by a decreased insulin sensitivity together with an inadequate insulin
response [12]. Obesity is an important risk factor for glucose intolerance during pregnancy
[12, 40], explaining the increased risk of GDM in women with a prepregnant BMI � 25 in
their first pregnancy when compared to women with BMI < 25 [Fig 4]. A normal pregnancy is
characterized by a 50%–60% physiological decrease in insulin sensitivity (before conception
until late pregnancy) [21, 40], and the pancreatic β cells compensate for this by increasing their
insulin secretion [12]. Results from our study suggest that increasing weight between first and
second pregnancy, during a relatively short time (more than 60% of the women in our study
had an interpregnancy interval of <24 months; Table 1), may stress the glucose metabolism
and cause a subclinical decreased insulin sensitivity among normal-weight women as well as
overweight women. Normal-weight women generally have a higher insulin sensitivity than
overweight and obese women [40]. We suggest that an additive effect of the physiological
decrease in insulin sensitivity during pregnancy may overload the capacity and increase the
susceptibility to develop GDM, especially in normal-weight women who are used to higher
insulin sensitivity.
Strength and limitations
We used data from a large population-based register with compulsory notification and negligi-
ble selection bias. Data were family-based, collected prospectively with a longitudinal design

 and included several confounding factors that made it possible to evaluate weight change as a
causal mechanism behind GDM. BMI represents prepregnant BMI and is not obscured by an
effect of gestational weight gain upon the risk of GDM, in contrast to most studies reporting
BMI before week 15 of pregnancy [25, 38, 39] or week 16–17 [36]. A limitation in our study
was the limited proportion of information on BMI available in both first and second preg-
nancy during the study period. However, comparing the study population with the population
with missing information on BMI [S10 Table], our study population is likely to be representa-
tive. Maternal weight gain during pregnancy depends on prepregnant weight [22]. When eval-
uating effect modification by gestational weight gain, we stratified on a possible intermediate
variable on the causal path from prepregnant BMI in second pregnancy (part of our exposure)
and GDM, which may have introduced bias in our estimates [41]. We cannot exclude unmea-
sured confounding, as we were not able to take into account other time-varying variables asso-
ciated with GDM, such as family history of GDM, mothers weight gain in childhood/early
adulthood, prepregnant diet, and vigorous exercise [34]. Data on height and weight are self-
reported, and as height tends to be overreported whereas weight is under-reported, this might
cause bias due to misclassification [42]. However, several studies have found self-reported
height and weight in women of reproductive age and in pregnant women to be valid [43, 44].
As data are collected prospectively, misclassification of BMI is independent of a later GDM
diagnosis and therefore likely to be nondifferential, which would tend to bias risk estimates
toward the null and underestimate the risk of GDM. We did not include gestational weight
gain during first pregnancy in our model and were therefore not able to make a distinction
between gestational weight gain in first pregnancy and interpregnancy weight change. Accord-
ing to observational studies, gestational weight gain is strongly associated with short- and
long-term postpartum weight retention [22, 45].
Health implications
Pregnant women who increase their weight by �1 BMI unit from their first to second preg-
nancy should be closely monitored during their second pregnancy to reveal development of
GDM, irrespective of prepregnant BMI. Antenatal guidelines for monitoring GDM in preg-
nancy should add interpregnancy weight change as an independent risk factor for GDM with
a routine stress-test of glucose tolerance during pregnancy in women with weight gain more
than 1 BMI unit. A possible preventive effect on GDM of losing weight between pregnancies
in overweight women needs to be replicated in other studies. Efforts that are targeting women
who are overweight in pregnancy and childbirth should expand in focus to promote healthy
weight from preconception throughout reproduction. Today, less than 10% of countries’
national policies address healthy maternal weight across the entire spectrum of childbearing
[46].
Conclusion
Women who increased their weight by �1 BMI unit from first to second pregnancy had
increased risk of GDM in the second pregnancy compared to women with stable weight (−1 to
<1 BMI unit change). This applied to women with prepregnant BMI below and above 25 in
the first pregnancy; however, the strongest association was found in women with BMI < 25.
We found a preventive effect on GDM in overweight women (first pregnancy) who reduced
their weight by �2 BMI units until the second pregnancy. Our results support a metabolic
mechanism behind the increased risk of GDM, represented by the weight change itself.
