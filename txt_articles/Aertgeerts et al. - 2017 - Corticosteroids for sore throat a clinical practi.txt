What is the role of a single dose of oral corticos-
teroids for those with acute sore throat? Using the 
GRADE framework according to the BMJ Rapid Rec-
ommendation process, an expert panel make a weak 
recommendation in favour of corticosteroid use. 
The panel produced these recommendations based 
on a linked systematic review triggered by a large 
randomised trial published in April 2017. This trial 
reported that corticosteroids increased the propor-
tion of patients with complete resolution of pain at 
48 hours. Box 1 shows all of the articles and evidence 
linked in this Rapid Recommendation package. The 
infographic provides the recommendation together 
with an overview of the absolute benefits and harms 
of corticosteroids in the standard GRADE format. 
Table 2 below shows any evidence that has emerged 
since the publication of this article. Clinicians and 
their patients can find consultation decision aids 
to facilitate shared decision making in MAGICapp 
(www.magicapp.org/goto/guideline/JjXYAL/sec-
tion/j79pvn).
Acute sore throat is defined as pain in the throat for less 
than 14 days. Acute sore throat could be caused by phar-
yngitis, nasopharyngitis, tonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess, 
or retropharyngeal abscess. Some patients with sore 
throat also experience headache, fever, muscle stiffness, 
cough, and general malaise.
Acute sore throat is common, but only a minority of 
patients will visit their general practitioner.1 A survey 
reported that the main reasons are to establish the cause 
of the symptoms, obtain pain relief, and to gain informa-
tion on the course of the disease.2 Data from Dutch and 
Flemish primary care databases show that, for every 1000 
consecutive patients consulting a general practitioner, 50 
present with an acute sore throat.3 4 In the US, more than 
92 million visits by adults to primary care practices and 
emergency departments between 1997 and 2010 were 
recorded.5 Sore throat presenting as acute tonsillitis is 
also the commonest cause for emergency admission to 
otorhinolaryngology services in the US.6
Acute sore throat is a self limiting disease and typi-
cally resolves after 7-10 days in adults and 2-7 days in 
children.7 Most infections are of viral origin; only a few 
are caused by a bacterial infection, of which group A 
β-haemolytic streptococcus, Haemophilus influenzae, and 
Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common pathogens. 
Evidence suggests that the time to resolution is not asso-
ciated with the type of pathogen.7 About 2% of patients 
initially presenting with sore throat will have a mononu-
cleosis infection caused by an Epstein-Barr virus, which 
could prolong the duration of symptoms.8
Some patients experience unacceptable morbidity and 
inconvenience, and miss school or work due to recurrent 
sore throat.9 Pain is a common reason for work or school 
absence. Complications of sore throat are rare: about 
0.2% of patients with tonsillitis will develop a periton-
sillar abscess.10
The diagnosis of an acute sore throat is based on signs 
and symptoms. The Centor clinical prediction rules can be 
used to help predict whether the sore throat is caused by a 
bacterial pathogen, and thus guide the decision whether 
to prescribe an antibiotic.11 12

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:
•   
Sore throat is one of the most common 
reasons for primary care appointments, and 
international guidance varies about whether 
to use corticosteroids to treat it, but a trial 
published in April 2017 suggested that 
costicosteroids might be effective
•   
We make a weak recommendation to use a 
single dose of oral corticosteroids, in those 
presenting with acute sore throat, after 
performing a systematic review of the new 
evidence in this rapid recommendation 
publication package
•   
The recommendation is weak and shared 
decision making is needed because 
corticosteroids did not help all patient 
reported outcomes and patients’ preferences 
varied substantially
•   
Steroids somewhat reduced the severity and 
duration of pain by one day, but time off 
school or work was unchanged. Harm seems 
unlikely with one steroid dose.
•   
The treatment is inexpensive and likely to be 
offered in the context of a consultation that 
would have taken place anyway

(up to 30 days).
Risks may outweigh benefits when 
cumulative doses of steroids are 
given for multiple episodes of sore 
throat. To mitigate this issue, 
clinicians could administer the 
medication in office if possible, 
or prescribe only one dose 
per visit.

RAPID RECOMMENDATIONS
settings, and the panel was therefore confident that the 
evidence was applicable to them as well. Most of the stud-
ies focused in adults only (60%). The studies that focused 
only on children (three studies, 2% of all the patients 
enrolled in the studies) did not include children younger 
than 5 years old, and thus the recommendation does not 
apply to younger ages.
Since the randomised controlled trials focused on 
patients who did not have recurrent episodes of sore 
throat, the panel was less confident of the applicability 
of the evidence to such patients, and the recommenda-
tion therefore does not apply to them. Similarly, the panel 
did not consider patients with sore throat after surgery or 
intubation, nor immunocompromised patients.
Understanding the recommendation
The recommendation for using corticosteroids made by 
the panel was weak because of the modest reduction of 
symptoms and the large variability in patient preferences.
The panel is confident that the recommendation 
applies to almost all patients with acute sore throat: chil-
dren 5 years and older and adults, severe and not severe 
sore throat, patients who receive immediate antibiotics 
and those who receive deferred antibiotics, patients with 
a viral or bacterial sore throat, and patients who seek 
Most guidelines recommend paracetamol or ibuprofen 
as the first choice treatment.13 The use of corticosteroids 
is mentioned in few, and is generally discouraged (table 
1). Antibiotics are probably not helpful for pain relief in 
an episode of acute sore throat caused by viruses, but may 
help those with a bacterial infection.14 15 Recommended 
management of sore throat varies widely, and table 1 
summarises current guidelines.
The evidence
The linked systematic review reports the effects of corti-
costeroids when added to standard care in patients with 
acute sore throat.16
Figure 1 gives an overview of the number and types of 
patients included, the study funding, and patient involve-
ment, as well as a summary of the benefits and harms of 
corticosteroids for treating acute sore throat.
The panel identified eight patient-important outcomes 
needed to inform the recommendation: complete resolu-
tion of pain, time to onset of pain relief, pain severity, 
need for antibiotics, days missed from school or work, 
recurrence of symptoms, duration of bad or non-tolera-
ble symptoms, and adverse effects. The included studies 
reported on all patient-important outcomes, except for 
duration of bad or non-tolerable symptoms. Regarding 
pain, the panel appraised the likelihood of complete reso-
lution of pain at 24 hours and 48 hours, as well as the 
mean time to complete resolution of pain and the mean 
time to onset of pain relief.
Although most of the studies (80%) were conducted 
in emergency departments, they accounted for 54% of 
all patients enrolled across studies. The remaining 46% 
were enrolled in the studies conducted in primary care

HOW THE RECOMMENDATION WAS CREATED
A large randomised controlled trial published in 
April 201721 found that corticosteroids increased 
the proportion of patients with complete resolution 
of symptoms at 48 hours. However, corticosteroids 
did not seem to decrease the duration of moderately 
bad symptoms, pain severity, healthcare attendance, 
days missed from school or work, or the consumption 
of delayed antibiotics. This study adds to the body of 
evidence that suggests that, although corticosteroids 
probably have benefits in patients with sore throat, these 
benefits may be modest.22-25 The Rapid Recommendations 
team felt that the study, when considered in context of the 
full body of evidence, might change practice.26
Our international panel—including general 
practitioners, general internists, paediatricians, an 
otorhinolaryngologist, epidemiologists, methodologists, 
statisticians, and people with lived experience of 
sore throat—decided what was the scope of the 
recommendation and the outcomes that are most 
important to patients. After a parallel team conducted 
a systematic review on the benefits and harms of 
corticosteroids,16 and a systematic search for evidence 
about patients’ values and preferences (appendix 1 on 
bmj.com), the panel met to discuss the evidence and 
formulate a recommendation. No person had financial 
conflicts of interest; intellectual and professional conflicts 
were minimised and managed (appendix 2 on bmj.com).
The panel followed the BMJ Rapid Recommendations 
procedures for creating a trustworthy 
recommendation,26 27 including using the GRADE 
approach to critically appraise the evidence and create 
recommendations (appendix 3 on bmj.com).28 The panel 
considered the balance of benefits, harms, and burdens 
of the drug, the quality of the evidence for each outcome, 
typical and expected variations in patient values and 
preferences, and acceptability.29 Recommendations can 
be strong or weak, for or against a course of action.

RAPID RECOMMENDATIONS
•   
A single dose of corticosteroids is unlikely to cause 
serious adverse events
 
– The randomised trials did not report any major event 
attributable to single dose corticosteroids (GRADE 
moderate quality evidence)
 
– The panel also considered evidence from 
observational studies that used higher doses of 
steroids. A large retrospective US cohort study of 
private insurance claims assessed adverse events 
in 327 452 adults who received an outpatient 
prescription of corticosteroids.18 There was a small 
absolute increase in the rate of sepsis, venous 
thromboembolism, and fracture in the first 30 days 
(GRADE low quality evidence, due to suboptimal 
verification of diagnosis in large databases and 
confounding by indication19). The panel agreed that 
such events seemed unlikely with single dose steroids
 
– Similarly, among paediatric populations, indirect 
evidence from a meta-analysis of 44 randomised 
trials did not report any major adverse events in 
patients with conditions requiring a short course of 
corticosteroids (such as asthma, bronchiolitis, croup, 
wheeze, and pharyngitis or tonsillitis)20
•   
There are no differences in the relative effects of 
corticosteroids (when compared with usual care) 
between primary care settings and emergency 
departments
•   
It is unlikely that new information will change 
interpretation for outcomes that are high to moderate 
quality of evidence.
care in the emergency department as well as those who 
attend primary care. The systematic review contained 
adequate representation from such groups and settings, 
and results were consistent (that is, absence of credible 
subgroup effects), for example, between trials of children 
and adults, and those seen in emergency departments 
and in primary care offices.16
Absolute benefits and harms
Although the evidence indicates that the treatment works 
on average, it did not reduce the severity of pain dramati-
cally and failed to improve several other patient-impor-
tant outcomes.
The infographic explains the recommendation and pro-
vides an overview (GRADE summary of findings) of the 
absolute benefits and harms of corticosteroids. Estimates 
of baseline risk for effects come from the control arms of 
the trials.16 The infographic also leads to point-of-care 
formats in the MAGICapp, including consultation deci-
sion aids designed to support shared decision making 
with patients.17
Considering the evidence and its certainty, the panel 
was confident that:
•   
Corticosteroids increase the chance of complete 
resolution of pain at 24 and 48 hours, reduce the 
severity of pain, and shorten the time to onset of pain 
relief (GRADE high to moderate quality evidence)
•   
Corticosteroids are unlikely to reduce recurrence or 
relapse of symptoms or days missed from school or 
work (GRADE moderate quality evidence)

RAPID RECOMMENDATIONS
to school or to perform at work are compromised, care 
givers wishing to reduce their children’s pain, or patients 
experiencing their pain as severe.
The panel believes that there is great variability in 
how much reduction in pain severity or time to complete 
pain resolution each patient would consider important. 
However, the greater the reduction in hours to achieve 
complete resolution of pain, the more likely it is that typi-
cal patients would place high value on those outcomes. 
Patients who place a high value in reducing the symptoms 
by any amount (such as patients with lower tolerance to 
pain or with severe symptoms) are more likely to accept 
receiving corticosteroids.
The weak recommendation for corticosteroids also 
reflects the concerns that the panel had with accepta-
bility. Specifically, how acceptable is it to treat a condi-
tion that is usually not severe and is self limiting with a 
drug that many patients, practitioners, and other stake-
holders know is almost always used for more severe dis-
eases.
The systematic search for empirical data on patients’ 
values and preferences related to sore throat identi-
fied 4149 references that were screened at the title 
and abstract level. From these, we screened 99 full 
text a 
rticles, from which only two provided relevant 
in 
formation on patients’ values and preferences (see 
appendix 1 on bmj.com). Neither of the studies provided 
additional data that had not been raised by the panel 
members: the panel had identified appropriate patient-
important outcomes and considered the variability in 
patient values and preferences regarding sore throat 
management.
The panel was less confident about whether:
•   
Corticosteroids reduced antibiotic use, due to a 
lack of improvement or worsening of symptoms 
in patients not prescribed antibiotics immediately 
when consulting the physician (GRADE low quality 
evidence)
•   
Corticosteroids reduced the average time to complete 
resolution of pain (GRADE low quality evidence).
Values and preferences
The weak recommendation for corticosteroids reflects a 
high value on a modest reduction of symptom severity 
and the time that it takes to achieve such improvement, 
and a substantial and important increase in the chance 
of complete resolution of pain at 48 hours.
The panel, including the patient representatives, felt 
that the values and preferences are likely to vary greatly 
across patients, which justifies a weak recommenda-
tion. For example, achieving complete pain resolution 
12 hours earlier may be of little importance for patients 
who feel less busy in their daily life, have higher tolerance 
to pain, or whose symptoms are not so severe; whereas 
it may be very important to patients whose ability to go 
HOW PATIENTS WERE INVOLVED IN THE CREATION 
OF THIS ARTICLE
Five people with lived experience of sore throat were 
full panel members. These panel members identified 
important outcomes, and led the discussion on values and 
preferences. These patient representatives agreed that 
while small reductions in pain severity and time to complete 
pain resolution (for example 12 compared to 24 hours) 
were important to them, these values may not be shared by 
all patients; they expected moderate to great variability in 
how much importance other patients would place in small 
reductions in pain. These panel members participated in 
the teleconferences and email discussions and met all 
authorship criteria.
P
EDUCATION IN PRACTICE
• How do you currently approach giving advice for 
those with acute sore throat? Do you consider offering 
corticosteroids?
• The recommendation for corticosteroid use is weak, and 
patient’s preferences are likely to vary. What information 
could you share with your patient to help reach a decision 
together?
• Have you learnt one thing from this article that might 
alter how you consult with patients with sore throat? How 
might you share this information with colleagues to learn 
together?
• To what extent do you practice shared decision making for 
such preference-sensitive decisions?

Practical issues and other considerations
Figure 2 outlines the key practical issues for patients and 
clinicians discussing adjunct steroids for sore throat, 
which are also accessible along with the evidence as 
decision aids to support shared decision-making in MAGI-
Capp. Steroids are typically given as 10 mg dexametha-
sone (or adapted to weight for children: 0.6 mg/kg, up 
to a maximum dose of 10 mg), typically taken as pill or 
intramuscular injection.
The risks may outweigh the benefits when larger 
cumulative doses of corticosteroids are given to patients 
who experience multiple episodes of sore throat, either 
through multiple visits or for patients who self medicate if 
prescribed more than one pill for their previous episode. 
To mitigate this issue, clinicians should administer the 
medication in office if possible or prescribe only one dose 
per visit.
Costs and resources
The panel focused on the patient perspective rather 
than that of society when formulating the recommen-
dation. Given the low cost of corticosteroids for treating 
sore throat, implementation of this recommendation is 
unlikely to have an important impact on the costs for 
health funders. The treatment is inexpensive and likely 
to be offered in the context of a consultation that would 
have taken place anyway. Nevertheless, it remains uncer-
tain whether it may increase the proportion of patients 
visiting a doctor to get a prescription of corticosteroids.
Uncertainties for future research
Key research questions to inform decision makers and 
future guidelines include:
•   
Are there any severe adverse effects of using one-
dose of steroids for treating sore throat?
•   
What are the effects of corticosteroids, in addition to 
standard care, in patients with recurrent episodes of 
acute sore throat?
Updates to this article
Table 2 shows evidence which has emerged since the 
publication of this article. As new evidence is published, 
a group will assess the new evidence and make a judg-
ment on to what extent it is expected to alter the recom-
mendation.
Competing interests: All authors have completed the BMJ Rapid 
Recommendations interests disclosure form and a detailed, contextualised 
description of all disclosures is reported in appendix 2 on bmj.com. 
As with all BMJ Rapid Recommendations, the executive team and The 
BMJ judged that no panel member had any financial conflict of interest. 
Professional and academic interests are minimised as much as possible, 
while maintaining necessary expertise on the panel to make fully informed 
decisions.
Funding: This guideline was not funded.
Transparency: B Aertgeerts affirms that the manuscript is an honest, 
accurate, and transparent account of the recommendation being reported; 
that no important aspects of the recommendation have been omitted; 
and that any discrepancies from the recommendation as planned (and, if 
relevant, registered) have been explained.
