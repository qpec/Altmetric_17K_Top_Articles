IMPORTANCE The rate of obesity among US women has been increasing, and obesity is
associated with increased risk of surgical site infection (SSI) following cesarean delivery. The
optimal perioperative antibiotic prophylactic regimen in this high-risk population undergoing
cesarean delivery is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To determine rates of SSI among obese women who receive prophylactic oral
cephalexin and metronidazole vs placebo for 48 hours following cesarean delivery.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized, double-blind clinical trial comparing oral
cephalexin and metronidazole vs placebo for 48 hours following cesarean delivery for the
prevention of SSI in obese women (prepregnancy BMI �30) who had received standard
intravenous preoperative cephalosporin prophylaxis. Randomization was stratified by intact
vs rupture of membranes prior to delivery. The study was conducted at the University of
Cincinnati Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, an academic and urban setting, between October
2010 and December 2015, with final follow-up through February 2016.
INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomly assigned to receive oral cephalexin, 500 mg,
and metronidazole, 500 mg (n = 202 participants), vs identical-appearing placebo
(n = 201 participants) every 8 hours for a total of 48 hours following cesarean delivery.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was SSI, defined as any superficial
incisional, deep incisional, or organ/space infections within 30 days after cesarean delivery.
RESULTS Among 403 randomized participants who were included (mean age, 28 [SD, 6]
years; mean BMI, 39.7 [SD, 7.8]), 382 (94.6%) completed the trial. The overall rate of SSI was
10.9% (95% CI, 7.9%-14.0%). Surgical site infection was diagnosed in 13 women (6.4%) in the
cephalexin-metronidazole group vs 31 women (15.4%) in the placebo group (difference, 9.0%
[95% CI, 2.9%-15.0%]; relative risk, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.22-0.77]; P = .01). There were no serious
adverse events, including allergic reaction, reported in either the antibiotic group or the
placebo group.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among obese women undergoing cesarean delivery who
received the standard preoperative cephalosporin prophylaxis, a postoperative 48-hour
course of oral cephalexin and metronidazole, compared with placebo, reduced the rate of SSI
within 30 days after delivery. For prevention of SSI among obese women after cesarean
delivery, prophylactic oral cephalexin and metronidazole may be warranted.

ealth care–associated infections are the most com-
mon complications of hospital care and contribute to
significant health care costs, patient morbidity, and
mortality. These infections affected an estimated 2 million in-
dividuals in 2014 based on national data from acute care and
long-term hospitals and rehabilitation facilities.1 Of the
51.4 million inpatient surgeries performed in the United States
annually in 2010, cesarean deliveries are the most frequently
performed surgery, accounting for 1.3 million cases.2 Studies
from various populations totaling approximately 9000 cesar-
ean deliveries from 2007 to 2011 demonstrated that an esti-
mated 3% to 12% of all cesarean deliveries were complicated by
surgical site infection (SSI), and the risk of SSI increased with
increasing maternal weight.3-6 Wloch et al6 demonstrated that
overweight women (body mass index [BMI] 25-30; calculated
asweightinkilogramsdividedbyheightinmeterssquared)had
anincreasedrateofSSI(oddsratio[OR],1.6;95%CI,1.2-2.2)with
aprogressiveriskassociatedwithincreasingBMI(30-35:OR,2.4
[95% CI, 1.7-3.4]; >35: OR, 3.7 [95% CI, 2.6-5.2]).
Routine use of preoperative cephalosporin antibiotics has
been shown to decrease the risk of SSI and is considered the
standard of care.7,8 Obesity is an independent risk factor for
SSI despite recommended preoperative antibiotic regimens.9
Limited studies have addressed optimal antibiotic regimens
for the prevention of SSI among obese women. Preoperative
cefazolin dose adjustments (2 g vs 3 g) have demonstrated
higher antibiotic tissue concentrations but have not demon-
strated clinical improvements in rates of SSI.10-13 Various post-
partum antibiotic combinations and durations have been stud-
ied with conflicting benefit, but no studies have specifically
addressed the obese population.14,15
The objective of this trial was to determine the effect of
an additional 48-hour course of postoperative, prophylactic
oral cephalexin plus metronidazole compared with the cur-
rent standard preoperative intravenous cephalosporin alone
on SSI among obese women after cesarean delivery.
Methods
Trial Design
Thisstudywasasingle-center,double-blind,randomizedclini-
cal trial conducted to determine the efficacy of postopera-
tive, prophylactic oral cephalexin plus metronidazole com-
pared with placebo for 48 hours after cesarean delivery for the
prevention of SSI among obese women who receive standard
preoperative cefazolin prophylaxis. The study was approved
by the University of Cincinnati Institutional Review Board.
Written informed consent of study participants was obtained
preoperatively or within 8 hours after cesarean delivery, fol-
lowedbyimmediaterandomization.Becausethecesareansur-
gical approach was standardized for the study, the principal
investigator set a predetermined study enrollment deadline to
avoidpotentialchangesinpracticepatternsthatmayoccurwith
prolonged study duration. The complete trial protocol is avail-
able in Supplement 1.
Cesarean surgical approach was standardized at the study
institution prior to the start of this trial according to evidence-
based practice at the time of study conception.16 All partici-
pantsreceivedchlorhexidineskinpreparation,unlesstherewas
a documented allergy in which case povidone-iodine would
be used. Standard sterile draping of participants was per-
formed. Intravenous cefazolin (2 g) was administered prior to
skin incision. A Pfannenstiel incision was the preferred skin
incision. However, decisions regarding the type of skin inci-
sion were left to the discretion of primary surgeons and indi-
vidualized to participants.
The cesarean delivery was performed in standard
accepted practice and the fascia was closed with a monofila-
ment suture in a running-stitch fashion.17 The subcutane-
ous layer was reapproximated with 3-0 polyglactin in either
running or interrupted sutures if the depth measured 2 cm
or more. Skin incisions were closed using 4-0 polyglactin or
poliglecaprone in a subcuticular fashion unless a primary
surgeon believed skin staples were superior for an indi-
vidual case. Deviations from the outlined standardized sur-
gical protocol were recorded and analyzed. Surgical dress-
ings were removed 24 to 36 hours postoperatively. Incisions
were examined daily in the hospital by labor and delivery
physician teams.
Patient Selection and Randomization
Women with a prepregnancy BMI of 30 or higher, with a final
plan for cesarean delivery, and aged at least 13 years who
were admitted to the labor unit for delivery were approached
for study participation. Study enrollment occurred between
October 2010 and December 2015 and participants were fol-
lowed up through February 2016. Exclusion criteria included
known immunodeficiency syndromes, non–English speak-
ing, known allergies to cephalosporin or metronidazole, or
planned administration of antibiotics in the postpartum
period for any medical or obstetric indication.
Investigators, physicians, labor and postpartum staff,
and participants remained blinded to treatment allocation
through the entire duration of the study. All study partici-
pants received standard intravenous cefazolin (2 g) prior
to surgical incision. After providing informed consent to par-
ticipate in the trial, women were randomized to receive
either a prophylactic 48-hour course of oral cephalexin,
500 mg, and oral metronidazole, 500 mg, or identical-
appearing placebo, every 8 hours for a total of 6 doses of each
Key Points
Question Does postpartum prophylactic oral cephalexin and
metronidazole decrease surgical site infection rates among obese
women who receive standard preoperative antimicrobial
prophylaxis and undergo cesarean delivery?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial among 403 obese
women, the rate of surgical site infection within 30 days following
cesarean delivery was 6% with oral cephalexin and metronidazole
and 15% with placebo, a significant difference.
Meaning Among obese women who undergo cesarean delivery,
use of prophylactic oral cephalexin and metronidazole may be
warranted for prevention of surgical site infection.

 antibiotic. The first dose of study medications was sched-
uled to be given 8 hours after intravenous cefazolin was
administered. Study drug deviations were reported, includ-
ing study drugs initiated more than 12 hours after adminis-
tration of preoperative intravenous antibiotics, missed
dose(s) of study drug, administration of study drugs more
than 1 hour after the scheduled time of administration, and
patient voluntary withdrawal from the study prior to the
last scheduled dose.
Randomization scheme was stratified by membrane sta-
tus prior to delivery (intact membranes vs rupture of mem-
branes [ROM]). The University of Cincinnati Medical Center,
Office of Clinical Research, Investigational Pharmacy pre-
pared separate randomization schemes for study participants
with intact membranes and ROM using the Wichmann-Hill
random number generator with blocks of 10.18 Investiga-
tional medications and placebo preparations were blinded
by overencapsulation in size 00 dark green opaque capsules.
A small amount of lactose powder was added to capsules to
minimize any movement within the capsule.
Study Outcomes
The primary study outcome was development of an SSI
within 30 days of delivery. Surgical site infection was
defined according to the National Healthcare Safety Net-
work of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and
comprised superficial incisional, deep incisional, or organ/
space infections (see eTable 1 in Supplement 2 for outcome
definitions).19 Prespecified secondary outcomes included
any incisional morbidity, defined as any defect in the inci-
sional integrity with or without the presence of an infection,
including cellulitis, endometritis, and wound separation.
Additional secondary outcomes included endometritis, cel-
lulitis, fever of unknown etiology (any temperature greater
than 38.3°C without an attributable source), and wound
separation. Cellulitis was defined as an infection of the skin,
underlying soft tissue, or both requiring antibiotics for
treatment. Wound separation included any defect in the
skin incision of at least 1 cm.
Participants returned for postoperative evaluations at 2
and 6 weeks postpartum. Postpartum diagnoses of SSI were
made by treating physicians and verified by chart review or
discussion with diagnosing physicians by principal investi-
gators or research registered nurses , who were unaware of
the study group assignments. Follow-up examination visits
included a detailed history and review of systems to screen
for infection and medication adverse effects following
delivery. Examination of patients’wounds determined evi-
dence of wound separation, erythema, induration, or signs
of wound abscess. Participants’vital signs were measured
and a point-of-care urinalysis performed to assess for pres-
ence of urinary tract infection. Individuals who did not pre-
sent for either the 2- or 6-week postpartum follow-up
examination were called by a research registered nurse or
investigator for a minimum telephone assessment, resched-
uled for a follow-up visit, or both. Participants were ques-
tioned regarding pain at incision site, drainage from inci-
sion, fever symptoms, separation of incision, antibiotic
administration after hospital discharge, and additional visits
to any medical facility for incisional problems or potential
medication-related concerns.
Data Collection and Blinding
Research registered nurses and study investigators obtained
demographic and medical history and follow-up outcomes
at the time of enrollment, following delivery, and postpar-
tum. Study data were collected by 3 coinvestigators blinded
to study group designation (A.M.V., S.R., and C.R.W.) and
were managed using the Research Electronic Data Capture
(REDCap) electronic data capture tools hosted at the Cincin-
nati Children’
s Hospital Medical Center.20 REDCap is a
secure web-based application designed to support data cap-
ture for research studies.
Data pertinent to other potential risk factors for SSI were
collected, including race/ethnicity, chronic hypertension,
and diabetes. Maternal race/ethnicity was self-reported as
an open-ended question on collection of the demographic
information at the time of enrollment and confirmed upon
data abstracted from the electronic medical record. Analysis
of race/ethnicity was included because prior studies have
demonstrated higher rates of SSI among black women.21 The
data were reviewed and cross-checked for accuracy by
C.R.W. prior to data analysis. Statistical analyses were per-
formed by E.D., who was blinded to study group designation
and not involved in study recruitment or data collection.
The data continued to be blinded until all statistical analyses
were complete.
Statistical Analyses
A sample size was calculated to reflect a clinically and statis-
tically meaningful difference in SSI rates between all obese
women who received postcesarean antibiotics to those who
received placebo. Prior to the designing of the study, the rate
of SSI was 20% in the population of obese women undergo-
ing cesarean delivery at our institution. The following
assumptions were considered in the power analysis: 50%
relative SSI reduction, baseline SSI rate of 20%, 10% rate of
postpartum loss to follow-up, 2-sided α=.05, 80% power, and
1:1 ratio of exposed to unexposed. A relative risk reduction of
50% was chosen given studies available during study design
that had demonstrated similar reductions with antibiotic pro-
phylaxis, a reduction that was deemed to be clinically mean-
ingful, and one that could potentially outweigh risks of
expanded antibiotic use.22,23 The total sample size to detect a
clinically relevant and moderately large effect size in SSI
reduction was 438 participants.
The primary outcome was reported as the difference in
proportion of SSI between the cephalexin-metronidazole
group and the placebo group. To quantify the effect of anti-
biotics on the dichotomous outcomes of SSI and other
wound morbidities, a log-binomial model, generalized lin-
ear model, with log link was used. The analysis was
performed with an intention-to-treat principle, including
participants lost to follow-up postpartum or with any study
deviations. The number needed to treat to prevent 1 SSI
was calculated.

 Approximately 5% of patients had missing follow-up
information on the primary outcome of SSI. To account for
the potential influence of missing outcome data on risk esti-
mates, a multiple imputation sensitivity analysis was per-
formed. Multiple imputation using multivariate normal dis-
tribution with 10 imputations was used, achieving 99%
relative efficiency and ensuring in-range values. A regres-
sion analysis was conducted on each imputed data set,
which combines the results using a weighted average
approach that accounts for the variation among imputed
data sets.
Secondary outcomes were analyzed on an exploratory ba-
sis comparing the rates and differences in proportion of out-
comes between the cephalexin-metronidazole and placebo
groups with associated 95% confidence intervals.
Although randomization was stratified by membrane
status, sample size calculations were not predetermined to
represent subgroup comparisons. Therefore, post hoc analy-
ses comparing SSI rates between women who received
cephalexin-metronidazole vs those who received placebo in
each subgroup (intact membranes or ROM) were performed
to calculate the frequencies, differences, and 95% confi-
dence intervals of primary and secondary outcomes among
participants in the cephalexin-metronidazole group com-
pared with placebo participants. A test of interaction was
performed to analyze interaction between membrane status
and the primary outcome.
Comparisons with a 2-sided P<.05 or 95% confidence in-
terval without inclusion of the null were considered statisti-
cally significant. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata
software, release 12 (Stata Corp).
Results
Study Population
Of the 1002 women who met BMI eligibility for the trial, 149
(14.9%) met at least 1 exclusion criteria, 378 (37.7%) declined
study participation, and 71 (7.1%) were not approached, sec-
ondary to unavailable study staff to enroll the patient and ob-
tain informed consent or concern about the patient’
s ability
to provide informed consent or follow-up for postpartum care
(Figure).
A total of 404 study participants were enrolled, and 1 par-
ticipant was excluded from analysis because her study group
designation could not be determined. Enrollment was discon-
tinued prior to achieving the targeted number of participants
after reaching the predetermined study deadline that had been
set by the principal investigator and approved by the institu-
tionalreviewboard.Theplannedsamplesizewasnotachieved
largely because of a higher-than-anticipated need to con-
tinue antibiotics for medical indications such as chorioamnio-
nitis among participants with ROM.
Study participants were randomized to receiving postop-
erative cephalexin-metronidazole (n = 202 participants) or
identical placebo (n = 201 participants). Maternal demo-
graphic,medical,andsurgicalcharacteristicsofthestudypopu-
lation are summarized in Table 1.
Of the 404 participants randomized, 382 (94.6%) com-
pleted the trial, 357 (88.1%) completed the medication regi-
men without deviation, 12 (3.0%) voluntarily withdrew
from the study before the first medication administration or
prior to completion of the scheduled regimen, and 43
(10.6%) had 1 or more drug administration deviations. Of
the medication administration deviations, 22 (51.2%) were
attributable to participants missing the last dose of study
drug secondary to hospital discharge. Twenty-one (5.2%) of
404 participants could be reached only by telephone and
were not examined during follow-up. The cephalexin-
metronidazole and placebo groups had similar rates of loss
to follow-up (5.0% vs 5.9%, respectively; difference, 0.5%;
95% CI, −3.8% to 4.9%; P = .81).
Study Outcomes
The overall rate of SSI, the primary outcome, was 10.9%
(95% CI, 7.9%-14.0%) in the study population, occurring in
13 (6.4%) of 202 women who received a postoperative
course of cephalexin-metronidazole vs 31 (15.4%) of 201
women in the placebo group (difference, 9.0%; 95% CI,
2.9%-15.0%; P = .01). The relative risk (RR) of SSI in the anti-
biotic group compared with the placebo group was 0.41
(95% CI, 0.22-0.77) (Table 2). Considering the influence of
missing data, multiple imputation analysis of the primary
outcome estimated an absolute between-group difference
in rates of SSI with antibiotics vs placebo of 10.9% (95% CI,
6.1%-15.7%) and an RR of 0.36 (95% CI, 0.23-0.57), which
were consistent with the original analysis. The number
needed to treat to prevent 1 SSI in all obese women under-
going cesarean delivery was 12 (95% CI, 6.7-33.8).
Prespecified secondary outcomes are also shown in
Table 2. Cellulitis was the only secondary outcome with a
significant reduction with prophylactic antibiotics, occur-
ring in 12 of 202 (5.9%; 95% CI, 2.7%-9.2%) participants
who received metronidazole-cephalexin vs 27 of 201 (13.4%;
95% CI, 8.9%=18.2%) participants who received placebo
(mean difference, 7.5% [95% CI, 1.7%-13.0%]; RR, 0.44 [95%
CI, 0.23-0.84]). There were no significant differences
between cephalexin-metronidazole and placebo for the
other prespecified secondary outcomes, including rates of
incisional morbidity, fever of unknown etiology, wound
separation, or endometritis.
There were no serious adverse events or allergic reac-
tions reported for cephalexin or metronidazole. Twelve
patients voluntarily withdrew from participation, 4 (2%) in
the antibiotic group and 8 (4%) in the placebo group, and
nausea was the most commonly reported reason for study
discontinuation.
Post hoc subgroup analyses were conducted among
patients with and without ROM (Table 3). Randomized par-
ticipants who had ROM comprised 31.5% (63/203) of the
cephalexin-metronidazolegroupand31.3%(63/201)ofthepla-
cebo group (difference, 0.2%; 95% CI, −8.9% to 9.3%; P = .97).
AmongparticipantswithROMpriortodelivery,thecephalexin-
metronidazole and placebo groups demonstrated no sig-
nificant difference, respectively, in the duration of ROM

The rate of SSI was 19.8% among women with ROM
and 6.9% among those with intact membranes [difference,
13.9%; 95% CI, 12.8%-26.9%; P < .001). Post hoc analysis
revealed that among participants with ROM prior to cesarean
delivery, SSI occurred in 6 (9.5%) of 60 in the cephalexin-
metronidazole group and 19 (30.2%) of 58 in the placebo
group (difference, 22.8%; 95% CI, 8.3%-37.2%; P = .008).
Among participants with intact membranes, SSI occurred in 7
(5.0%) of 132 in the cephalexin-metronidazole group com-
pared with 12 (8.7%) of 132 in the placebo group (difference,
3.8%; 95% CI, −2.5% to 10.1%; P = .47). Interaction test-
ing was performed between study groups (cephalexin-
metronidazole vs placebo) and by membrane status (intact vs
ROM) (eTable 2 in Supplement 2). The rate of SSI was highest
in those with ROM who received placebo (30.2%) and lowest
in those with intact membranes who received antibiotics
(5.0%), but the test for interaction did not show statistical
significance at P = .30.
Discussion
In this clinical trial involving obese women undergoing cesar-
ean delivery after receiving standard intravenous preopera-
tive cefazolin prophylaxis, a 48-hour postoperative course of
oral cephalexin-metronidazole, compared with placebo, sig-
nificantly decreased the rate of SSI within 30 days after deliv-
ery. Among the secondary outcomes measured, patients
treated with cephalexin-metronidazole had lower rates of cel-
lulitis but no significant decrease in other secondary out-
comes, including rates of incisional morbidity, fever of un-
known etiology, wound separation, or endometritis.

 Cephalexin-metronidazole therapy has broad-spectrum
antibiotic coverage and has demonstrated efficacy in the treat-
ment of intra-abdominal infections in nonobstetric patients as
well as decreased postcesarean infections when given
preoperatively.15,24 Obesity is associated with comorbidities,
anatomical factors (ie, skin folds and increased tissue pres-
sure), and bioactive adipose tissue that increase the risk of
SSI.25 Adipose tissue is highly active and secretes a wide range
of hormone factors, chemokines, and, importantly, cyto-
kines, regulating inflammation and oxidative stress.26 In ad-
dition to greater anaerobic coverage, metronidazole has anti-
inflammatory properties and the antimicrobial activity of
metronidazole’
s hydroxymetabolite against common iso-
lates associated with postcesarean infections, including
Mycoplasma, Ureaplasma, and Gardnerella species.14,27,28
Cephalexin and metronidazole have high oral bioavail-
ability and pharmacoeconomic advantages and are gener-
ally well tolerated, supporting the drug combination as
a choice for postpartum prophylactic coverage.29 A 48-hour
time course for prophylaxis was chosen considering the bio-
logical stages of wound healing. After the initial 1- to 2-day
hemostatic and inflammatory phases of healing, the prolif-
eration period occurs and includes epithelization, angiogen-
esis, and granulation tissue formation. This period is critical
for the proper deposition of fibroblasts, basement membrane
organization, and collagen formation.30 Because regulation
of this inflammatory phase is important for the remodeling
periods of healing, we chose a 48-hour course of prophylactic
antibiotics to provide coverage while reepithelialization
occurs. This study was the first to our knowledge to evaluate
the use of a prophylactic postcesarean course of cephalexin-
metronidazole for prevention of SSI in an obese population.
Cellulitis was the most frequent incisional morbidity
observed in the study and had improved rates of SSI among

 participants who received postpartum antibiotics. The sec-
ondary outcomes were not powered to determine a statisti-
cally significant difference between participants who
received cephalexin-metronidazole vs those who received
placebo. Therefore, this study cannot conclude that post-
partum cephalexin-metronidazole reduces the other indi-
vidual secondary outcomes. Rupture of membranes was
associated with SSI. However, the tests for interaction
between the intact membranes and ROM subgroups and
postpartum cephalexin-metronidazole were not statistically
different and should not be interpreted as showing a differ-
ence in significance or effect size among the subgroups with
and without ROM.
Prior to the routine use of preoperative prophylactic an-
tibiotics, Elliott and Flaherty31 demonstrated a prolonged
course of cephalosporin decreased the risk of endometritis
compared with no antibiotic prophylaxis. Previous studies
comparing prolonged antibiotic administration with a short or
preoperative course of antibiotics for prevention of postcesar-
ean infectious morbidity have not shown an infectious reduc-
tion with postpartum antibiotic regimens.32,33 However, these
studies included women of all BMI categories, took place in
low-resource areas, had higher proportions of immunocom-
promised participants, were underpowered, and were con-
founded by significant nutritional challenges, which are not
generalizable to our population.
The use of additional broad-spectrum antibiotics has
been shown to reduce SSI in women in all BMI categories
undergoing cesarean delivery. Tita et al5 demonstrated a de-
crease (RR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.38-0.68; P < .001) in postcesarean
SSIbyexpandingthepreoperativeantimicrobialspectrumwith
azithromycin among women in labor and those with ROM but
notspecificallyamongobesewomen.Thesestudyresultswere
published in the final year of the current study enrollment pe-
riod, and azithromycin was chosen to increase coverage of
Mycoplasma isolates. Although this study targeted prepreg-
nancy obesity and the C/SOAP Consortium study focused on
women in labor as the high-risk cohort,5 there is considerable
populationoverlap,andbothstudiesdemonstratedsimilarand
significant reductions in SSI.
Obesity during pregnancy has been associated with
numerous adverse maternal and fetal outcomes such as
macrosomia, cesarean delivery, and cerebral palsy.34-36
In addition, obese women who have medical or perinatal
complications are less likely to initiate or will prematurely
discontinue breastfeeding.37 Although both cephalexin
and metronidazole are detected in breast milk in low con-
centrations, previous studies have not demonstrated any
serious adverse outcomes with cephalexin or metronidazole
used as single or combination therapy.38-40 Long-term child-
hood or adverse neonatal outcomes specific to cephalexin-
metronidazole exposure cannot be determined, as outcome
measures were not evaluated for this study protocol. Recog-
nizing the maternal and neonatal benefit of breastfeeding,
the lack of known neonatal adverse effects, and maternal
reduction in SSI, the benefit of this antibiotic regimen likely
outweighs the theoretical risks of breast milk exposure in
the obese population.
This study has several strengths. First, the study used a
randomized, blinded design; included representation of
a diverse, high-risk patient population; and included a rela-
tively large cohort of obese participants. Second, the pri-
mary outcome of interest is a significant health care–
associated infection that is common and preventable.
Although prior studies have demonstrated undergoing labor
prior to delivery significantly increased postoperative infec-
tions after cesarean deliveries among all BMI categories,
these studies were not focused to the obese population nor
stratified by membrane status prior to delivery.3,21 Third,
the magnitude of the reduction of SSI with postcesarean
delivery related to antibiotic prophylaxis in this population
(RR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.22-0.77) is both statistically significant
and clinically meaningful.
This study also has several limitations. First, the trial
was performed at a single site with a high prevalence of obe-
sity, which may not be generalizable to all obstetric prac-
tices. Second, women diagnosed as having chorioamnionitis
were excluded from study enrollment because they repre-
sent a separate risk population. The current study design
was unable to assess efficacy among this population. Third,
the analyses did not account for multiple comparisons and
subgroup interactions, so all secondary outcomes and find-
ings based on stratification of intact or ruptured membranes
should be considered exploratory and hypothesis generat-
ing. Fourth, this study had insufficient power to determine
a significant reduction in SSI in the subgroup of women
with intact membranes. The majority of women with intact
membranes had scheduled cesarean deliveries and did not
have contractions resulting in cervical change, and only 7%
of women in this study went into labor with intact mem-
branes prior to cesarean delivery. Hence, the efficacy of pro-
phylactic postpartum antibiotics in this subgroup cannot be
determined from the current study, but the findings provide
support to promote further study of this subset of partici-
pants. Fifth, this trial included a very specific population of
women with prepregnancy obesity undergoing cesarean
delivery, and the findings should not be extrapolated to
other populations or other surgical procedures. Sixth,
enrollment was terminated before target recruitment was
met (targeted: n=438; actual: n=404) secondary to a prede-
termined stop date; however, a lower rate of attrition was
experienced (10% projected; 5% actual). Seventh, adverse
events were monitored per institutional review board proto-
col, but data regarding more specific minor adverse effects
were not collected unless reported by participants.
Conclusions
Among obese women undergoing cesarean delivery who re-
ceived standard preoperative cephalosporin prophylaxis, a
postoperative 48-hour course of cephalexin-metronidazole,
compared with placebo, reduced the rate of SSI within 30 days
of delivery. For prevention of SSI among obese women after
cesarean delivery, prophylactic oral cephalexin and metroni-
dazole may be warranted.
