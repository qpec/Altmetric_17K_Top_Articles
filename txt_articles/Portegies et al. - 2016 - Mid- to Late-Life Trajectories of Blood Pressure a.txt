ypertension is a major treatable risk factor for stroke, 
with an estimated attributable risk of 35% to 50%.1,2 
Most studies that examined the association between hyper-
tension and incident stroke used a single measurement or the 
average of blood pressure levels assessed over time. Results 
from such approaches have suggested that the risk of stroke 
increases with increasing blood pressure levels and that even 
prehypertension is associated with stroke.3–6 Indeed, the cur-
rent guideline to treat people above a certain target level of 
blood pressure (eg, 150/90 mmHg7 or 140/90 mmHg8–10) is 
largely based on such knowledge. However, long-term pat-
terns (ie, trajectories) of blood pressure may further influence 
stroke risk. Studies in young- and middle-aged adults showed 
that increases in blood pressure over long periods (10–30 
years) are related to an increased risk of stroke and cardiovas-
cular disease,11–13 and that trajectories of higher blood pres-
sure relate to a higher risk of subclinical atherosclerosis.14 
Trajectories in older people may vary even more because it is 
particularly in later ages that arterial stiffness increases, which 
is associated with increases in blood pressure and blood pres-
sure variability.15–17 Furthermore, studies suggest that lower 
blood pressures might also be harmful in this population, lead-
ing to an increased risk of myocardial infarction or death.18–20 
This has particularly been observed for low diastolic blood 
pressures18,19 although low systolic blood pressures (SBPs) 
also seemed to be harmful in patients with vascular disease 
and diabetes mellitus.20 To date, no study of long-term blood 
pressure trajectories in mid- to late-life has been conducted. 
Furthermore, it is unknown whether such trajectories relate 
to stroke. If we hope to empirically inform and refine preven-
tion guidelines, a much-needed first step is to describe the 
prototypic and commonly observed patterns of blood pressure 
trajectories.
Therefore, the aim of our study was to identify long-term 
trajectories of blood pressure in a population-based study and 
to examine the risk of stroke within those trajectories. We 
focused on SBP because it is the best predictor of cardiovas-
cular events.21
Abstract—Hypertension is a major modifiable risk factor for stroke. Associations of blood pressure with incident stroke 
are mostly based on single or average blood pressure levels. However, this approach does not take into account long-
term trajectories of blood pressure, which can vary considerably in the elderly. Within the population-based Rotterdam 
Study, we examined trajectories of systolic blood pressure in 6745 participants (60.0% women) over an age-range from 
55 to 106 years and jointly modeled their risk of stroke and competing causes of death using joint latent class mixed 
modeling. Four trajectories were identified. Class 1 was characterized by blood pressure increasing gradually from on 
average 120 to 160 mm Hg over 5 decades (n=4938). Compared with this class, class 2, characterized by a similar midlife 
blood pressure, but a steep increase (n=822, increasing from 120 to 200 mm Hg), and class 4, characterized by a high 
midlife blood pressure (n=115; average 160 mm Hg) and had a higher risk of stroke and death. Class 3, characterized by a 
moderate midlife blood pressure (n=870; average 140 mm Hg), had a similar risk of death as class 1, but the highest risk 
of stroke. Assessing trajectories of blood pressure provides a more nuanced understanding of the associations between 
blood pressure, stroke, and mortality. In particular, high blood pressure and rapidly increasing blood pressure patterns are 
associated with a high risk of stroke and death, whereas moderately high blood pressure is only related to an increased 
risk of stroke. Future studies should explore the potential pathogenic significance of these patterns.  (Hypertension.

Methods
Setting and Study Population
This study was conducted within the prospective, population-based 
Rotterdam Study. Details on the objectives and design of the study 
have been described elsewhere.22 Baseline examinations started 
in 1990 among 7983 people of ≥55 years residing in Ommoord, a 
suburb of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Follow-up examinations take 
place every 3 to 4 years.
For the current study, data from 5 follow-up visits from 1990 to 
2011 were used. Participants with no informed consent for follow-
up data collection (n=226), prevalent stroke at baseline (n=243), no 
center visit prior to a stroke (n=668), and completely missing in-
formation on blood pressure and blood pressure–lowering medica-
tion (n=101) were excluded, resulting in 6745 participants eligible 
for the current analysis. Only measurements before occurrence of 
stroke were used. We had 6679, 5018, 3570, 2891, and 1499 mea-
surements at each of the 5 center visits, respectively, totaling 19 657 
measurements.
The Rotterdam Study has been approved by the Medical Ethics 
Committee of the Erasmus MC and by the Ministry of Health, 
Welfare and Sport of the Netherlands, implementing the Wet 
Bevolkingsonderzoek: ERGO (Population Studies Act: Rotterdam 
Study). All participants provided written informed consent to par-
ticipate in the study and to obtain information from their treating 
physicians.
Assessment of Blood Pressure
During each visit, blood pressure was measured twice in the right 
arm, in sitting position, after a resting period of 5 minutes. The aver-
age of the 2 measurements was used in the analyses. Until November 
7, 2006, a Hawksley random-zero sphygmomanometer was used,23 
and for measurements after this date Omron M6 Comfort and Omron 
M7 devices were used.24,25
Assessment of Stroke
Stroke was defined according to WHO criteria as a syndrome of 
rapidly developing clinical signs of focal (or global) disturbance 
of cerebral function, with symptoms lasting ≥24 hours or lead-
ing to death and no apparent cause other than of vascular origin.26 
This corresponds to International Classification of Diseases-Tenth 
Revision codes I61, I63, and I64. At baseline, history of stroke 
was assessed by interview and verified using medical records.27 
Subsequently, participants were continuously followed up for 
occurrence of incident stroke, by digital linkage of the general 
practitioners’ medical records with the study database. Nursing 
home physicians’ medical records and general practitioners’ medi-
cal records of participants who moved out of the Ommoord district 
were checked on a regular basis as well. Of all potential strokes, 
medical records from general practitioners and hospital discharge 
letters were collected and reviewed by research physicians. An 
experienced vascular neurologist verified the diagnoses. Follow-up 
through January 1, 2013, was complete for 98.9% of potential 
person-years.28
Covariates
Covariates were assessed at each center visit. Details on the assess-
ment of anthropometrics, cardiovascular risk factors (total choles-
terol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, diabetes mellitus type 2, 
and smoking), and the use of medication have been described previ-
ously.29 Current alcohol use was assessed during each home interview 
and categorized into yes versus no. The use of blood pressure-lowering 
medication included the use of diuretics, β-blocking agents, calcium 
blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, and angiotensin-converting 
enzyme-inhibitors if prescribed for the indication hypertension. The 
second center visit had limited examinations, and in particular had no 
assessment of cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and 
diabetes mellitus status. Therefore, measurements from the preceding 
center visit were carried forward.
Statistical Analysis
We investigated the association of longitudinal trajectories in SBP over 
age with the risk of stroke using a joint latent class mixed model. The 
main goal of a joint latent class mixed model is to describe the link 
between a continuous progression of diseases through longitudinal 
markers such as blood pressure, and the incidence of clinical events.30,31 
The model uses all available information from the blood pressure and 
outcome measurements to model trajectories and co-occurring events 
like stroke and death.30,31 Because hypertension has been associated 
with both ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes,16 we examined the risk 
with all stroke types. Models were fit using the Jointlcmm function of 
the lcmm package in R.32 The joint latent class mixed model assumes 
that people’s blood pressure trajectories cluster in a set of mutually 
exclusive patterns or latent classes. That is, there are prototypical pat-
terns in blood pressure trajectories that individuals follow. In the cur-
rent analysis, the model differentiates the population into groups (latent 
classes) with different profiles of blood pressure and links these classes 
to potential risk of stroke.30,31,33 Trajectories of blood pressure over 
age from 55 years onward were modeled using a class-specific linear 
mixed model with age as time.34 Because blood pressure may have a 
nonlinear pattern, we also added a class-specific quadratic age term. 
We included random intercepts and random slopes in all analyses. We 
added class-specific adjustments for sex and baseline blood pressure–
lowering medication because we expected these variables may influence 
the evolution of blood pressure. People entered at study baseline and 
were censored at date of stroke, date of death, last date of follow-up or 
January 1, 2013, whichever came first. The optimal number of classes 
was defined by the model with the lowest Bayesian information crite-
rion.31 Analyses were repeated using different random starting values 
to ensure convergence to the global maximum of the model.31 We were 
primarily interested in stroke as outcome, but added stroke-free mortal-
ity because it is an important competing risk. The joint survival model 
was therefore defined by a 2-parameter Weibull distribution with a class-
specific baseline risk function for both stroke and the competing risk 
of mortality because of any other cause than stroke.30,35 This includes 
cardiovascular deaths. The survival function was adjusted for sex and 
blood pressure–lowering medication, and in the multivariable model, 
we additionally adjusted for visit-specific cholesterol, high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol, lipid-lowering medication, body mass index, 
smoking, alcohol use, diabetes mellitus type 2, and antithrombotic med-
ication. Adjustments in the survival part of the analysis were only made 
for baseline characteristics. However, we do provide characteristics of 
later visits, to compare the evolution of these characteristics together 
with blood pressure. ANCOVA was used to study differences in baseline 
characteristics between subjects within the different estimated trajectory 
classes, adjusted for age and sex. Covariates were missing for up to a 
maximum of 4.6% across assessments. Missing values were imputed by 
the mean of 5 imputations, using multiple imputation based on the other 
covariates of the same visit. Class-specific trajectories of blood pressure 
or cumulative incidences of stroke or death were estimated for the mean 
value for all covariates. A Monte Carlo method was used to calculate the 
confidence intervals of the cumulative incidences.32
Sensitivity Analyses
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the robustness of our 
results to modeling decisions, missing data, and censorship. First, we 
inspected models based on 1 fewer and 1 greater trajectory than the 
model chosen based on lowest Bayesian information criterion. Second, 
we added a cubic age term. Third, to understand the robustness of our 
observed patterns to missing values and censoring for stroke or death 
in between the measurements, we repeated our analyses based on data 
from only the first 3 visits (from 1989 to 1999) in the people with-
out missing values in these visits and examined the survival curves 
thereafter (from 1999 to 2013). Fourth, because few participants were 
alive and stroke free after the age of 80 years, we wanted to under-
stand whether our identified trajectories were similar in only younger 
ages. Therefore, we also repeated analyses in which we only included 
SBP measurements assessed between the ages of 55 and 80 years. 
Finally, although latent class modeling is a useful data-reduction tool 
for understanding general patterns, individual membership in a class

or trajectory is probabilistic. As a posterior check to see how observed 
trajectories of blood pressure of individual participants aligned with 
the identified trajectories in our final model, as well as to visually 
assess missing data patterns, we plotted the individual blood pressure 
values by most likely trajectory class, visit, outcome, and age.36
Results
Characteristics of the Trajectory Classes
Participants had a mean (±SD) follow-up of 13.5±6.8 years, 
during which 1053 strokes occurred.
When investigating the trajectories, we found that the joint 
latent class model with 4 classes had the best fit, with the lowest 
Bayesian information criterion (Table S1 in the online-only Data 
Supplement). Mean posterior class membership probabilities (ie, 
the probability that a person belongs to his or her most likely class) 
were ≥63% for each class in this model. Figure 1A shows the 4 
identified trajectories of SBP, based on the joint latent class mixed 
model. The largest class was characterized by a gradually increas-
ing blood pressure, starting at ≈120 mm 
Hg at the age of 55 years 
and increasing up to ≈160 mm 
Hg at the age of 95 years (class 
1, n=4938). A smaller class was characterized by a similar blood 
pressure at the age of 55 years, but a much steeper increase up to 
≈200 mm 
Hg (class 2, n=822). Two classes were characterized by 
a relatively higher baseline blood pressure: one of ≈140 mm 
Hg, 
with modest variation over time (class 3, n=870), and the other of 
≈160 mm 
Hg, which decreased after age 65 (class 4, n=115). Figure 
S1 shows the model-based trajectories compared with the mean 
observed values in the classes. The predicted values only diverge 
slightly from the observed values in people at old age. For instance, 
the observed values of the high baseline SBP class plateau at old 
age, whereas the predicted trajectory continues to increase.
People in class 4 were more frequently men (Table). Mean 
and maximum baseline blood pressure assessments were 
highest in class 4 followed by the class 3 and class 2. The use 
of blood pressure–lowering medication was similar between 
classes at baseline, but at the end of follow-up, the class 3 
and class 4 had higher proportions of blood pressure–lower-
ing medication users. Values on other covariates at each study 
visit are presented in Table S2. We found a large difference in 
frequency of current smokers among classes, with particularly 
higher frequencies in class 2 and class 4.
Risk of Stroke and Death for the Separate 
Trajectories
Relative to class 1, the increased risk of stroke was apparent 
in class 4 beginning at the age of 55 years onward, whereas 
increased stroke risk began later (age, ≈65 years) for classes 2 
and 3 (Figure 1B). The 3 classes had a significantly and sub-
stantially higher risk of stroke than class 1 (eg, 4.7%–13.6% 
compared with 0.7%). The estimated risks up to the age of 
75 years seemed higher in class 4 (13.6%) than in classes 2 
(8.1%) and 3 (4.7%) although the wide confidence intervals 
limited interpretability (Table S3). Classes 2 and 4 also had 
the highest risk of dying through other causes (Figure 1C). 
The cumulative incidence curves in those classes plateaued 
around ages 75 to 85 years, at that time roughly all people 
in the classes were diagnosed as having a stroke or died. The 
risk of stroke in class 3 continued to increase until older age. 
However, the risk of dying was lower than in class 2 and 4, 
similar to class 1.
At the end of follow-up, 2546 people (51.5%) in class 1, 
575 (70.0%) people in class 2, 288 (33.1%) people in class 3, 
and 87 (75.7%) people in class 4 died because of a nonstroke-
related cause. Between 25% and 38% of nonstroke deaths in 
each class were because of cardiovascular events (Figure S2).
Multivariable-adjusted models were relatively similar 
although some people’s most probable class membership 
switched. Risks of stroke in class 2 and 4 attenuated, whereas 
the risk became stronger in class 3 (Figure 2).
Sensitivity Analyses
Visual assessment of individual blood pressure patterns by 
participants’ most likely class membership, visit, age, and out-
come suggested that the model-based patterns were unlikely 
to be influenced by missing data and that the described trajec-
tories reflected observable patterns within and across individu-
als (Figure S2). On the contrary, differences in blood pressure 
over time seen between classes 1 and 2 were mainly apparent

in older people. Furthermore, people assigned to class 4 often 
had a stroke or death at young age, with few people within this 
class having decreases in blood pressure, suggesting that the 
model-estimated decrease in this trajectory may be an artifact 
of a small number of survivors.
The 3- and 5-class model did not provide any additional 
insights. In the 3-class model, no class resembling class 4 was 
identified. In the 5-class model, the class resembling class 4 
with respect to the high midlife blood pressure was further sub-
divided into a class that was increasing and a class that was 
decreasing. For classes that heuristically overlapped with those 
identified in the 4-class models, patterns of stroke and mortal-
ity risk were similar. The class with a high midlife blood pres-
sure that was increasing, was related to both stroke and death, 
whereas the class with a high midlife blood pressure that was 
decreasing, was associated only with death; for both classes, 
numbers were low.
In the sensitivity analysis in which we only included people 
that completed the 3 first visits of blood pressure measurement, 
trajectories of blood pressure remained similar. Furthermore, 
we found a similar risk of death in the different classes. The 
risk of stroke was highest in class 3, followed by class 2. Class 
4 did not have an increased risk of stroke (Figure S3).
In another sensitivity analysis in which trajectories were 
formed based only on measurements at the ages of 55 to 80 
years only, trajectories and associated risks of stroke were 
similar to our main findings (Figure S4).
We report the results of trajectories that only allowed for a 
quadratic effect of age over time. As sensitivity analysis we did 
add a cubic age term, but this did not provide any additional 
insight (Figure S5).
Discussion
In this population-based study of people aged ≥55 years, 
 
we identified 4 trajectories of blood pressure: a class character-
ized by a gradually increasing blood pressure from ≈120 to 
160 mm Hg (on average) over 5 decades (class 1); a class char-
acterized by a more steep increase from an average of ≈120 to 
200 mm Hg (class 2); a class characterized by a moderate blood 
pressure (≈140 mm Hg) at midlife and throughout (class 3); and 
a class characterized by a high blood pressure (≈160 mm Hg) 
at midlife that decreased (class 4). The class with a high blood

pressure at midlife and the class with a steep increase had the 
highest risks of stroke and death through the age of 80 years. 
The class with a moderate blood pressure only had an increased 
risk of stroke, but not death, compared with the class with a low 
blood pressure at midlife and a gradual increase.
The trajectories that we identified extend results from prior 
studies of blood pressure trajectories in young- to middle-aged 
people. Those studies identified 4 to 5 parallel trajectories in 
which trajectories with long-term higher blood pressure related 
to more cardiovascular pathology.12–14 In our older population, 
we also observed that the class with a high midlife blood pres-
sure had the highest risk of stroke and death compared with the 
class with the lowest blood pressure. However, a novel finding 
of our study is that the slope of increase was associated with 
an increasing risk of stroke and competing causes of death. 
Namely, we identified 2 classes characterized by equally low 
baseline blood pressure and increasing trajectories, but only 
the class characterized by steep increases had a high risk of 
stroke and death. Of note, the risks in that class were even simi-
lar to the class with a high midlife blood pressure.
The trajectories and risk patterns identified in this article 
could inform future research on the cause and potentially 
treatment guidelines, but the current study does not itself 
address such pathogenic or treatment questions. Latent class 
mixture modeling is a useful data-reduction tool and is partic-
ularly helpful to describe prototypical and common patterns. 
It does not, however, account for time-dependent confounding 
or selection biases that may explain the trajectories and risks 
estimated. Therefore, the associations with stroke risk seen 
across our 4 trajectories could be, in part or whole, because of 
many noncausal explanations, including differences in health 
behaviors, healthcare utilization, and competing risks through-
out the study period.37,38 Moreover, findings from the classes 
are not necessarily applicable to individual participants’ 
blood pressure effects, particularly because class member-
ship is probabilistic. On the contrary, identifying the patterns 
described in our study is an important step because they evoke 
new causal and treatment questions that can motivate future 
studies to explore the pathogenic significance and predictive 
value of the associations. Questions raised by the patterns in 
our study are would we reduce stroke risk if we recommended 
blood pressure medication to nonhypertensive middle-aged to 
older patients with fast increases in blood pressure? Or, would 
we reduce stroke risk if the current treatment level of 140/90 
mm Hg or 150/90 mm Hg is lowered to also include people 
with moderately elevated blood pressure? In addition, trajec-
tories may inform physicians about people who need further 
attention for their high risk of stroke or death.
Combining our study results with previous evidence, we 
can speculate to the biological plausibility that treating middle-
aged to older patients with (1) moderate blood pressure or (2) 
fast increasing blood pressure could reduce strokes. The first is 
supported by previous studies that found a relationship between 
prehypertension and stroke, and less of prehypertension with 
other vascular disease.39–41 This suggests that the brain may be 
particular vulnerable to vascular damage. Whether it is likely that 
treatment of fast increasing blood pressure reduces stroke and 
death is less clear. It is known that vascular stiffness increases 
with aging.15,42 This leads to an increase in blood pressure and 
may explain the gradually increasing blood pressure trajectory 
in the largest part of the population.15,42 However, this does not 
explain why another class was characterized by a much steeper 
increase. It may be that this trajectory reflects a higher vascular 
age.43 This is supported by our findings that associations with 
stroke attenuated after adjusting for other cardiovascular risk 
factors. They may have stiffer vessels, which could lead to a 
steeper increase or a blood pressure resistant to treatment.44 The 
higher vascular age may then contribute to the increased risk 
of stroke and death. Furthermore, the steep increase in blood 
pressure may trigger rupture of an arteriole leading to a hemor-
rhagic stroke.45 Knowing whether a fast increasing blood pres-
sure causally relates to stroke and death is important, because 
people with fast increasing blood pressure may be missed using 
current guidelines, leading to undertreatment. Correspondingly, 
only 33% of the people in the fast increasing class used blood 
pressure–lowering medication at their end of follow-up. On

the contrary, this could also mean that this class reflects people 
with more unhealthy behavior that are less adherent to medi-
cation themselves. Further research is necessary to unravel the 
pathogenic background of the trajectories. This should include 
the question whether some trajectories reflect advancing stages 
of vascular ageing. For example, with advancing vascular age, 
people may move from an increasing trajectory to the trajectory 
of consistently high blood pressure.
Strengths of our study are the large study population, 
the use of repeated measures of blood pressure over a long 
follow-up, and the thorough collection of stroke assessments. 
However, our study also has some limitations. We only exam-
ined associations with all stroke, numbers were too small to 
examine stroke subtypes. Furthermore, we obtained a maxi-
mum of only 5 measurements of blood pressure per patient. 
More measurements would probably lead to more precise 
results and possibly more or differently defined trajectories. 
It might also reduce the effect of regression to the mean and 
within-individual variability. Moreover, there may have been 
misclassification among classes because of individual variabil-
ity or reliability in blood pressure assessments. Nevertheless, 
the trajectories may aid detection of high-risk patients even if 
the trajectories are, in part, explained by a white-coat effect 
or variability. In addition, the trajectories may be less reliable 
at old ages when we had fewer measurements although our 
trajectories were consistent up through the age of 80 years 
whether later assessments were included in the model. Finally, 
we did not have information about blood pressure at earlier 
ages. Future studies should examine the lifetime trajectory of 
blood pressure and the risk of stroke.
Perspectives
Treatment of blood pressure to reduce the risk of stroke is 
currently focused on blood pressure levels. In this population-
based study on blood pressure trajectories, we had the novel 
finding that the trajectory with fast increasing blood pressure 
was related to a high risk of stroke and death. It shows that 
single values of blood pressure do not tell the whole story. This 
may inspire future studies to examine the predictive value of 
blood pressure trajectories for stroke and mortality. In addition, 
future studies are needed to determine the pathogenic signifi-
cance of blood pressure changes. If the blood pressure slope is 
causally related to stroke and not just a reflection of an individ-
ual’s health behavior, it may be a novel target for prevention.

What Is New?
• We identified 4 trajectories of systolic blood pressure in people aged ≥55 
years and assessed the risk of stroke and death across those trajectories. 
The class with a normal blood pressure at midlife that gradually increased 
had the lowest risk of stroke and competing causes of death. The class 
with high blood pressure at midlife and the class with a normal blood pres-
sure at midlife, but a steep increase, had the highest risk of stroke and 
competing causes of death. The class with a moderate blood pressure at 
midlife and throughout had a longer survival, but a higher risk of stroke.
What Is Relevant?
• Not only levels of blood pressure but also trajectories of blood pressure 
over time are associated with the risk of stroke and mortality. Of par-
ticular novelty is the class characterized by a steep increase in blood 
pressure because people in this class may not be noticed in time given 
current treatment guidelines. Future studies should extend these find-
ings to determine whether this class can be a target for prevention. In 
addition, our findings can form the basis for future studies on the use of 
trajectories for prediction.
Summary
Our findings suggest that 4 trajectories of blood pressure can be 
identified in middle-aged to older individuals. Because they associ-
ate differently with the risk of stroke and death, they are potentially 
important for preventive strategies.
