Summary
Background During the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) era, many countries in Africa achieved marked 
reductions in under-5 and neonatal mortality. Yet the pace of progress toward these goals substantially varied at the 
national level, demonstrating an essential need for tracking even more local trends in child mortality. With the 
adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, which established ambitious targets for improving 
child survival by 2030, optimal intervention planning and targeting will require understanding of trends and rates of 
progress at a higher spatial resolution. In this study, we aimed to generate high-resolution estimates of under-5 and 
neonatal all-cause mortality across 46 countries in Africa.
Methods We assembled 235 geographically resolved household survey and census data sources on child deaths to 
produce estimates of under-5 and neonatal mortality at a resolution of 5 × 5 km grid cells across 46 African countries 
for 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. We used a Bayesian geostatistical analytical framework to generate these estimates, 
and implemented predictive validity tests. In addition to reporting 5 × 5 km estimates, we also aggregated results 
obtained from these estimates into three different levels—national, and subnational administrative levels 1 and 2—to 
provide the full range of geospatial resolution that local, national, and global decision makers might require.
Findings Amid improving child survival in Africa, there was substantial heterogeneity in absolute levels of under-5 
and neonatal mortality in 2015, as well as the annualised rates of decline achieved from 2000 to 2015. Subnational 
areas in countries such as Botswana, Rwanda, and Ethiopia recorded some of the largest decreases in child mortality 
rates since 2000, positioning them well to achieve SDG targets by 2030 or earlier. Yet these places were the exception 
for Africa, since many areas, particularly in central and western Africa, must reduce under-5 mortality rates by at least 
8·8% per year, between 2015 and 2030, to achieve the SDG 3.2 target for under-5 mortality by 2030.
Interpretation In the absence of unprecedented political commitment, financial support, and medical advances, the 
viability of SDG 3.2 achievement in Africa is precarious at best. By producing under-5 and neonatal mortality rates at 
multiple levels of geospatial resolution over time, this study provides key information for decision makers to target 
interventions at populations in the greatest need. In an era when precision public health increasingly has the potential 
to transform the design, implementation, and impact of health programmes, our 5 × 5 km estimates of child mortality 
in Africa provide a baseline against which local, national, and global stakeholders can map the pathways for ending 
preventable child deaths by 2030.

Introduction
Improvement of child survival is a long-standing inter-
national priority,1–3 and as shown in the last few decades, 
substantial progress has been accomplished in reducing 
child mortality and absolute inequalities in rates of child 
death across countries worldwide.4,5 Yet by the conclusion 
of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which 
aimed to reduce under-5 mortality by two-thirds from 1990 
to 2015, only 57 of 195 countries and territories worldwide 
met or exceeded the pace of progress required to achieve 
MDG 4 (ie, a 4·4% annualised rate of decline) during that 
period.5 Additionally, despite narrowing disparities over 
time, geographic inequalities persisted among countries 
with the lowest and highest child mortality rates. In sub-
Saharan Africa, for example, this divergence in 2015 
spanned from 15·6 deaths per 1000 livebirths in Botswana 
to 135·0 deaths per 1000 livebirths in the Central African 
Republic.5 National mortality rates, although useful for 
macro-level com 
parisons,4,6,7 obscure variations in child 
survival at lower administrative units (eg, districts), the 
levels at which most health programme planning and 
implementation occur. Without advancing the aims of 
precision public health, which includes robust subnational 
mon 
itoring of child mortality levels and trends, health 
authorities face sizeable chall 
enges to optimally funding 
and targeting interventions for the populations who most

need them.8–11 Ending all preventable child deaths by 2030 
is the bold aim set forth by the Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs),3 and an ambition that requires a much 
better understanding of where exactly the largest gaps 
remain in improving child survival.
Advances in both data availability and statistical methods 
have facilitated subnational assessments of under-5 mor-
tality in several sub-Saharan African coun 
tries, inc 
luding 
provinces in South Africa,4 regions in Tanzania,12 states in 
Nigeria,13 counties in Kenya,4 and districts in Ghana, 
Mozambique, Uganda, and Zambia.14–16 Such work has 
unveiled the initial magnitude of subnational dis 
parities 
in all-cause child deaths, but it is likely that much more 
heterogeneity remains within formal admin 
istrative units. 
In an ideal setting, national vital registration or health 
information systems would routinely capture local data on 
deaths and births, and estimates of child survival could be 
generated at a similar resolution on the basis of vital 
registration data. However, few countries in sub-Saharan 
Africa have complete or high-quality vital registration 
systems,17–19 and thus often rely on household surveys and 
periodic censuses to assess their demographic and health 
profiles.20 These data sources often include geolocated 
cluster-level or administrative-area-level identi 
fication. 
They can therefore be analysed with spatially explicit 
methods such as model-based geostatistics, which 
quantify spatial differences in variables from geolocated 
data. Use of model-based geostatistics allows for the 
synthesis of disparate geographical data into gridded 
maps and thus yields comparable high-resolution 
estimates over larger study areas.21,22 Previous studies have 
used model-based geostatistics methods to produce 
gridded estimates of infant mortality and child mor-
tality in Mali,23 and advance 
ments in computational 
statistics now allow for high-resolution estimation 
of health outcomes and related indicators at the 
continental scale.24–27
Recent analyses28,29 have sought to quantify under-5 
mortality with greater geospatial resolution in sub- 
Saharan Africa, including one study that produced 
10 × 10 kilo 
metre (km) estimates of all-cause under-5 
mor 
tality in 28 countries.29 However, these studies 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
Since the adoption of the Millennium Development Goals, 
monitoring levels and trends of child mortality has been a key 
component of benchmarking progress in child health, as has 
the prioritisation of policy and financial attention to achieve 
these targets. International assessments, such as the Global 
Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD), 
systematically quantify under-5 mortality rates at national 
levels and over time, and increasingly more studies have 
analysed subnational under-5 mortality trends in sub-Saharan 
Africa, Latin America, and Asia. Although this work is of high 
relevance to decision making, marked inequalities in child 
survival could remain beyond provincial and even district levels, 
and differing data sources and methodological approaches 
might limit comparability across subnational studies. In the 
absence of fully operational and representative vital 
registration systems for tracking highly local trends in child 
mortality, a promising approach is to harness the plethora of 
available geolocated data.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this study offers the first quantification of 
levels and trends of under-5 and neonatal mortality at a 
resolution of 5 × 5 km in 46 countries in Africa between 2000 
and 2015. Our methodological approach includes several 
advantages over recent efforts to produce local estimates of 
child mortality. We made full use of geo-referenced data from 
235 household sample surveys and censuses and related 
covariates over space and time. We used child death data from 
both complete and summary birth histories and synthesised 
data that could be precisely located to survey-cluster GPS 
locations with data that could only be designated to 
administrative levels. We used country estimates from the 
latest iteration of the GBD to calibrate the aggregation of our 
5 × 5 km estimates to national levels.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our study offers a highly granular baseline analysis for 
assessing progress toward child mortality targets established 
under Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.2: reducing 
under-5 mortality to 25 deaths per 1000 livebirths or lower, 
and neonatal mortality to 12 deaths per 1000 livebirths or 
lower in all countries by 2030. Although both under-5 
mortality and neonatal mortality rates have generally 
improved throughout Africa since 2000, striking 
heterogeneity emerged both in terms of 2015 mortality rates 
and annualised rates of decline achieved between 2000 
and 2015. Areas in Botswana, Rwanda, and Ethiopia recorded 
some of the largest decreases in under-5 mortality since 2000, 
which could position these places well to reach SDG 3.2 
by 2030 or earlier. Yet attaining SDG 3.2 remains a very 
ambitious goal for much of Africa, with several areas—
particularly in central and western Africa—needing to reduce 
under-5 mortality rates by at least 8·8% per year between 
2015 and 2013, to achieve the SDG 3.2 target by 2030. This 
kind of unprecedented progress in improving child survival 
will require substantial inter-sectoral investment and 
innovation, ranging from the expansion of high-quality health 
care to heightened socioeconomic prospects across 
communities. By generating estimates of child mortality 
across a range of subnational levels—from 5 × 5 km pixels to 
the first and second administrative levels—our study offers 
decision makers greater precision with which they can design 
and target high-impact child health interventions in Africa.

feature several data and methodological shortcomings. 
First, previous studies exclusively drew from the 
Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) series for their 
data sources,28,29 constraining their analyses to a limited 
subset of surveys with both complete birth histories and 
GPS-identified survey clusters. Second, popular spatial 
interpolation methods such as kernel-density estimation 
can be overly sensitive to data variations that result from 
small numbers found at the survey cluster rather than 
true subnational differences in child survival. Without a 
more stable estimation approach that accounts for spatial 
and temporal correlations in the data, misleading or 
implausible results can arise (eg, localities experiencing 
increases in under-5 mortality that exceeded an average 
of 10% per year from the 1980s to 2000s).29 Third, recent 
analyses do not have the temporal specificity or timeliness 
that is of greatest demand from policy makers; for 
instance, a study that presented decade-wise estimates 
for the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s29 could not detail the 
potential effects of the MDGs on under-5 mortality 
trends. Last, previous studies have not calibrated the 
aggregation of geospatial estimates to externally validated 
national estimates,4,5,30 a key step to ensuring the internal 
consistency of subnational results. Since high-resolution 
estimates of child mortality could serve as a crucial 
input for local health programme funding and deploy-
ment, it is of equally high importance to address these 
out 
standing data and analytic challenges.
In this study, we aimed to advance geospatial analysis of 
child mortality in Africa by using a larger set of data 
sources and types than previously published, as well as 
applying advanced modelling tech 
niques22,24,27,31 in order to 
generate high-resolution estimates of under-5 and neonatal 
all-cause mortality in 46 countries in Africa in 2000, 2005, 
2010, and 2015.
Methods 
Overview
Our analysis provides estimates of under-5 mortality 
(the probability of death before age 5 years per 
1000 livebirths) and neonatal mortality (probability of 
death within first month of life per 1000 livebirths) for 
each 5 × 5 km cell in 46 countries in Africa. These 
countries accounted for 54% of global under-5 deaths 
in 2015,5 and they fully overlap with the African coun-
tries included in the EQUitable Impact Sensitive Tool 
(EQUIST), a UNICEF-supported initiative that aims to 
maximise the effect of health policies for children who 
reside in low-income countries. Analytical steps are 
described below and in the appendix. Our study follows 
the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health 
Estimates Reporting (GATHER). The GATHER checklist 
appears in the appendix.
Data
We extracted data on child mortality and geographical 
locations from censuses and several household survey 
series, including the DHS, UNICEF Multiple Indicator 
Cluster Surveys, and other country-specific surveys. We 
included data sources if they had summary or complete 
birth history modules and subnational geographical infor-
mation. When available at the cluster level (ie, a group of 
neighbouring households or a village associated with a set 
of geolocated data), data were extracted together with 
cluster GPS or located on the basis of precise location 
names (n=59 279). In the absence of geographic coord-
inates, we extracted names of the smallest available 
administrative area units (n= 6111). The appendix lists all 
data sources (pp 7–22).
We estimated child mortality rates in 5-year periods, 
such that mortality rates for each period of time represented 
probabilities of death for a synthetic cohort. Thus, mortality 
rates at each point in time reflected average mortality rates 
over the corresponding years. For the estimates, we refer to 
1998–2002 as 2000, 2003–07 as 2005, 2008–12 as 2010, and 
2013–17 as 2015. These estimates were disaggregated by 
monthly probabilities of death for the age groups of first 
month of life, 1–11 months, 12–35 months, and 
36–59 months. As such, exposures and deaths could fall 
into one of 16 age-group–time period bins. A month 
counted as an exposure if the child was alive at the 
beginning of the month. Probability of death before 
reaching age 5 years for a given period can then be 
calculated directly as 1 minus the product of age-bin-
specific survival probabilities (appendix p 23).32 Only 
livebirths were captured and we did not estimate stillbirths.
We extracted two types of child mortality data, namely 
complete birth histories and summary birth histories. 
Data availability by type and country is shown in figure 1, 
and is further detailed in the appendix (pp 7–22). Records 
of complete birth histories contain dates of birth and 
death, as applicable, of all children of sampled women. 
We summed the total exposure months and death events 
within each age group and time period at the most 
precise available geographic level (ie, either cluster points 
or administrative polygons). Summary birth history 
records provide considerably less information than 
complete birth histories. They only include mothers’ 
reports of the total number of children ever born and 
those who died, and do not include children’s age or date 
of death. How 
ever, summary birth history data are 
relatively easy to collect and are widely available in 
Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys and censuses. After 
we extended methodological advancements in model-
based approaches to adjust data on summary birth 
histories,33 we developed a model using data in which 
both complete and summary birth histories were 
available, to partition summary birth history data into 
age-specific and period-specific mor 
tality probab 
ilities, 
and applied this relationship to datasets in which 
summary birth history data were available. Additional 
detail on our summary birth histories-adjustment model 
is in the appendix (pp 24–31). Finally, bias ratios calculated 
for GBD 2016,5 which are specific to data type, source,

and year, were applied to both complete birth histories 
and summary birth histories data (appendix p 31).
When cluster-level geographic coordinates were not 
available for a given country, we matched reported 
administrative units with first-level, second-level, or 
third- 
level administrative divisions from the Global 
Adminis 
trative Unit Layers database or the Database of 
Global Administrative Areas. We refer to the geo-
graphical data that only contained administrative boun-
daries as poly 
gons. If data could not be mapped to 
administrative units (polygons) from these sources, we 
matched them using other sources or modified available 
polygons on the basis of the available information about 
polygon boundaries. In several cases, for example, we 
disaggregated an adminis 
trative unit into city boundaries 
and the surrounding rural area to match the dis-
aggregation of the available mortality data. We resampled 
polygon data into geographically dispersed points and 
weighted them on the basis of population. In terms of 
sample size, polygons contributed 41% of the total data 
(appendix pp 32–37).
To inform our model, we compiled several layers of 
sociodemographic and health-related covariates at the 
5×5 km pixel level (value estimates for each 5×5 km grid 
cell in the study area), all of which have shown some 
relationship with child survival or overall child health 
outcomes. The covariates were average years of edu-
cational attainment of women aged 15–49 years,34,35 
prevalence of wasting and stunting in children younger 
than 5 years,36 Plasmodium falciparum parasite rate,24 a 
proxy index of fertility (based on the ratio of women 
aged 15–49 years and children under 5 years) per pixel,37,38 
and total population.39 Additionally, we included several 
covariate layers that were reflective of potential environ-
mental and infrastructural factors related to overall 
development and thus child survival (ie, an enhanced 
vegetation index,40 daytime land-surface temperature,40 
proportion of land under irrigation,41 urban-rural dis-
tinction,42 brightness of night-time light from the Defense 
Meteorological Satellite Program,43,44 and accessibility to 
cities with populations greater than 50 000).45 When several 
years’ worth of data were available, we either took the 
synoptic mean from available years in each estimation 
period or used the mid-period-year estimate. Two covariate 
layers, irrigation and accessibility, were only available for 
the year 2000, and therefore did not vary over time in our 
analysis. The appendix contains more information on our 
spatial covariates, including plots of all covariates 
(pp 38–39).

We then used an ensemble method, stacked general-
isation, to select covariates, capture possible non-linear 
effects, and to account for the complex interactions between 
them.31 For each age group and year, we fit four sub-models, 
namely generalised additive models, boosted regression 
trees, lasso regression, and ridge regression, and predicted 
for each cluster in the data using five-fold cross-validation. 
The four sub-model predictions were included as covariates 
when fitting the full geostatistical model described below. 
This approach removes covariates that are not predictive 
and identifies optimal combinations of covariates that are 
predictive, and thus is expected to improve overall 
predictive performance over a singular model.31 Because of 
their heightened predictive validity, ensemble modelling 
approaches are increasingly used in population health 
measurement,46 as well as other fields.47,48 More details on 
this approach are in the appendix (pp 39–41).
Analysis
We fitted four separate Bayesian model-based geo 
statistics 
models (ie, one for each age group) to estimate the 
monthly probability of mortality in any given pixel. We 
modelled covariate effects using the ensemble approach 
discussed above, and the model explicitly accounted 
for spatiotemporal autocorrelation by modelling the 
covariance of data residuals in space and time. This allowed 
us to leverage the correlation structure of the data to more 
accurately predict mortality within locations where data on 
child death were absent. Pixel-level un 
certainty intervals 
(UIs) were generated from 1000 draws (ie, candidate 
maps)22 that were created from the posterior distributions 
of modelled parameters. The appendix includes additional 
detail of our model and estimation process (pp 41–46).
We then aggregated pixel-level estimates from the 
1000 candidate maps up to two subnational administrative 
units and national levels.49 Such aggregation allowed us to 
further calibrate estimates of under-5 and neonatal mor-
tality to national GBD estimates for the 2000, 2005, 2010, 
and 2015 periods.5 We achieved this by calculating the 
ratio of the population-weighted posterior mean national-
level estimate from our analysis to mean national esti-
mates for the same time period from GBD,5 and then 
multiplying each cell in the posterior sample by this ratio. 
The median for these ratios was 1·01 (IQR 0·95–1·07), 
indicating generally close agreement with GBD esti-
mates. The appendix includes scatterplots comparing our 
national-level estimates from this analysis with GBD 
estimates (p 50).
For reported results, we masked all final model outputs 
for which land cover was classified as barren or sparsely 
vegetated, on the basis of MODIS satellite data in 2013,50 
the most recent year of available data, as well as areas in 
which total population density was less than ten individuals 
per 1 × 1 km pixel in 2015.39
We validated our models using spatially stratified five-
fold out-of-sample cross validation and report bias (mean 
error), total variance (root-mean-square error), and 95% 
cluster-level data coverage within prediction intervals. We 
stratified space either by the first or second sub 
national 
administrative unit. By aggregating pre 
dictions and obser-
vations to administrative units, we could increase sample 
sizes to a level high enough for better determining model 
fit; this was not feasible at the cluster level because of data 
noisiness due to very small sample sizes. Generally, across 
our four models and at both levels of aggregation, we 
found out-of-sample mean error to be very close to zero, 
indicating no systematic bias. Correlations between aggre-
gated out-of-sample model fit and aggregated holdout data 
ranged from 0·81 to 0·94 for administrative level 1, and 
from 0·62 to 0·87 for administrative level 2. Root-mean-
square error relative to mean estimated probability ranged 
from 17·7% to 33·3% for administrative level 1 and 32·7% 
to 50·0% for administrative level 2. These metrics indicate 
relatively good model fits; however, these metrics are 
sensitive to sample sizes at aggregation and average 
probabilities at different age groups, and thus should 
be interpreted within that context. The 95% prediction 
interval at the cluster level covered 94% of the out-of-
sample data points, indicating that our models’ fit could 
reproduce out-of-sample data within the specified level of 
uncertainty. Detail on validation procedures and full results 
is in the appendix (pp 46–49).

Results
Although under-5 mortality rates decreased throughout 
Africa between 2000 and 2015 (figure 2), stark disparities 
endured across the continent and within national borders. 
On the basis of pixel-level estimates, we found that in 2000, 
most of sub-Saharan Africa recorded under-5 mortality rates 
exceeding 138 deaths per 1000 livebirths, while large swathes 
of Nigeria, Niger, Sierra Leone, and Mali, along with other 
countries in western and central Africa, surpassed 
200 deaths per 1000 livebirths. By 2015, half of sub-Saharan 
Africa had under-5 mortality rates below 72 deaths per 
1000 livebirths, and increasingly more places in Africa 
neared or had fewer than 25 deaths per 1000 livebirths, the 
SDG3.2 target for 2030. Nonetheless, 118 locations at the 
second administrative level in Chad, Mali, Burkina Faso, the 
Central African Republic, and Nigeria still faced average 
under-5 mortality rates higher than 170 per 1000 livebirths 
in 2015. Further, sizeable within-country inequalities re-
mained. For instance, Nigeria had a national under-5 
mortality rate of 115·4 deaths (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 
99·6–132·2) per 1000 livebirths in 2015,5 yet at the local

government area level (administrative level 2), under-5

1000 livebirths in the Osun local governmental area of 
Osogbo to 214·6 (190·2–240·6) deaths per 1000 livebirths 
in the Bauchi local govern 
mental area of Ningi.
Somewhat similar geographic patterns emerged for 
neonatal mortality as were found for under-5 mortality 
(appendix), with Botswana and Egypt having large areas 
meeting the SDG target (ie, 12 deaths per 1000 livebirths). 
In 2015, Côte d’Ivoire had one of the widest gaps between 
districts, ranging from 29·6 (95% UI 23·9–35·7) neonatal 
deaths per 1000 livebirths in Cavally in Montagnes district 
to 52·9 (43·2–64·1) neonatal deaths per 1000 livebirths in 
Bagoue in Savanes district. Côte d’Ivoire, Mali, and Nigeria 
all had second administrative units with mean neonatal 
mortality rates greater than 50 deaths per 1000 livebirths. 
More information on neonatal mortality can be found in 
the appendix.

Figure 3 illustrates the effects of disaggregating under-5 
mortality estimates across levels of geospatial granularity 
(national, first and second administrative levels, and the 
5 × 5 km grid), and how inequalities in child survival can be 
masked by geographic aggregation. In 2015, Egypt and 
Morocco achieved the SDG3.2 target for under-5 mortality, 
at 20·6 deaths per 1000 livebirths in Egypt and 22·9 deaths 
per 1000 livebirths in Morocco.5 Still, approxi 
mately 25% of 
each country’s population lived in areas with mortality 
rates higher than the SDG threshold. Botswana was the 
only other African nation that met the SDG 3.2 target 
by 2015, with an under-5 mortality rate of 15·6 deaths 
per 1000 livebirths.5 The appendix includes full geo-
graphical disaggregation of neonatal mortality rates by 
administrative level.

in 2015. Senegal, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda, 
Tanzania, and Zimbabwe had large areas with relatively 
low under-5 mortality and low uncertainty, whereas most 
of the Central African Republic and Somalia had both 
relatively high under-5 mortality and uncertainty. There 
were geographical areas of high mortality and low 
uncertainty in northern and eastern Nigeria, Mali, 
Burkina Faso, northern Cameroon, and southwestern 
Chad. By contrast, most of Botswana, Namibia, eastern 
Ethiopia, eastern Angola, and South Africa had relatively 
low under-5 mortality rates, but these estimates were 
accompanied by relatively high uncertainty. More plots of 
uncertainty in predictions are available in the appendix 
(pp 44–45).
In many countries, under-5 mortality decreased by 
more than 4·4% per year from 2000 to 2015 (figure 5),5 a 
rate that exceeded the pace of progress established under 
MDG 4 (ie, a two-thirds reduction by 2015). Further, 
average annualised rates of decline in Botswana, Ethiopia, 
Liberia, Rwanda, and Angola exceeded 6·0%. Many other 
countries, including Burundi, Malawi, Togo, Uganda, 
and Tanzania, had second-level administrative areas that 
had a mixture of annualised rates of decline between 2·0% 
and 4·4%, as well as those that exceeded a 4·4% decrease 
each year; results for administrative levels 1 and 2 are in 
the appendix. By contrast, areas throughout 17 countries, 
including the Central African Republic, South Sudan, 
Lesotho, and Madagascar, had no second-level admin-
istrative areas that achieved an average annualised rate of 
decline exceeding 4·4% from 2000 to 2015. Nigeria had 
wide disparities in terms of progress, with annualised 
rates of change spanning from 0·7% annual decline 
(95% UI 0·2% to –1·6%) to a 5·0% annual decline 
(–4·1 to –5·9%). On the basis of pixel-level annualised 
rates of decline achieved from 2000 to 2015, and 
projections of these rates through 2030 (figure 5), several 
countries could have localities achieving SDG 3.2 if past 
rates of decline in under-5 mortality are sustained over 
the next 15 years. These locations were primarily in 
northern, southern, and eastern Africa, but also included 
areas in Senegal, Liberia, and Ghana. 20 of the 46 
countries had second-level administrative areas that, on 
the basis of average current trajectories, could reduce 
under-5 mortality rates to 25 deaths per 1000 livebirths. 
However, only 26·1% of second administrative-level areas 
had an annualised rate of decline from 2000 to 2015 that 
was faster than the MDG 4 target of 4·4% per year. At 
least 60% of these locations need to match or surpass the 
rates of progress achieved from 2000 to 2015 to meet the 
SDG3.2 target for under-5 mortality by 2030 (figure 5). 
For instance, within the Central African Republic, Mali, 
Sierra Leone, Niger, Chad, and Burkina Faso, the majority 
of populations live in areas where annual declines 
of 8·8% or more are needed to achieve SDG 3.2.
Additional results can be found in the appendix and 
explored in a dynamic data visualisation.
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, our study offers the first 
quantification of 5 × 5 km estimates of under-5 and 
neonatal mortality in 46 African countries, highlighting a 
mixture of impressive gains and enduring disparities in 
child survival across the continent. By 2015, nearly all 
locations had a reduction in under-5 mortality rates from 
2000, with many areas of Ethiopia, Botswana, and 
Rwanda recording particularly large reductions. Yet in 
Chad, Mali, the Central African Republic, and Sierra 
Leone, more than half of populations live in places where 
under-5 mortality rates still exceeded 120 deaths per 
1000 livebirths in 2015. Despite achieving notable rates of 
decline between 2000 and 2015, most of Africa must 
substantially accelerate reductions in under-5 mortality to 
meet the SDG 3.2 target of 25 deaths per 1000 livebirths 
by 2030. These results underscore the crucial importance 
of tracking geospatially granular patterns in child survival, 
particularly if all countries aim to end all preventable 
child deaths by 2030.

Figure 4: Overlapping population-weighted quartiles of under-5 mortality and relative uncertainty in 2015
Under-5 mortality rate quartile cutoff points were 56, 80, and 102 deaths per 1000 livebirths. Relative uncertainty 
was computed as the ratio of the 95% uncertainty intervals and under-5 mortality rate for each pixel. Cutoff points 
for uncertainty were 29%, 35%, and 41%. The lowest quartile of mortality is white, and the highest is dark pink. 
The lowest quartile for uncertainty is white and the highest is blue. These colours overlap such that areas coloured 
purple have both high under-5 mortality rates and high relative uncertainty. Pixels with fewer than ten people and 
classified as barren or sparsely vegetated are coloured in grey. Grey areas with diagonal lines are not included in

Charting 5 × 5 km trends in child mortality from 2000 
to 2015 provides the foundation from which local 
achievements and challenges during the MDG era can be 
better understood. Although the duration of MDG assess-
ment spanned from 1990 to 2015, its greatest catalytic 
effects on political, social, and financial commit 
ments 
to improving child health in Africa mainly occurred 
from 2000—when the MDGs were established—to 2015. 
Nationally, 19 countries in Africa met or exceeded the 
MDG4 rate of reduction (4·4% each year) between 2000 
and 2015.5 Although several factors probably influenced 
this progress during the 2000s, the confluence of escalated 
development assistance focused on child health,51 the rapid 
scale-up of multiple interventions that target childhood 
illnesses (eg, vaccination, malaria control, and HIV 
prevention),25,52–56 and heightened overall socio 
economic 
development undoubtedly contributed to improving child 
survival in many African countries. By contrast, it is an 
unlikely coincidence that many places with slower gains 
(ie, much of the Central African Republic, Chad, and 
Somalia) also received less international funding for 
newborn and child health26 and had some of Africa’s lowest 
levels of overall coverage for key maternal and child health 
interventions.55 In Nigeria, for example, where annualised 
declines in under-5 mortality ranged from 0·7% each year 
to 5·0% per year since 2000, large differences in state-level 
trends for various maternal and child health interventions 
also occurred during that time.13 National case studies have 
explored drivers of MDG 4 progress in sub-Saharan 
Africa,54,57–60 but few delve into more local factors and their 
association with changes in under-5 and neonatal survival 
at a high geographic resolution. In-depth analyses that link 
our 5 × 5 km estimates of child mortality to more granular 
measures of intervention coverage and other indicators, 
akin to a recent study on the effects of malaria control in 
Africa,25 could strengthen inputs into local health policy 
and resource allocation planning.
In the transition from MDG 4 to SDG 3.2, child survival 
targets changed from achieving relative rates of progress to 
attaining absolute levels by 2030. This shift is heralded by 
many,61–63 because setting specific thresholds could 
encourage a greater focus on the places which bear the 
highest toll of child deaths. Effectively directing such 
attention might be a challenge in Africa, however, 
especially since more than 75% of the continent’s children 
live in areas where annual declines in under-5 mortality 
must exceed the pace of reductions they achieved 
from 2000 to 2015 to meet the SDG 3.2 target by 2030. 
From 2000 to 2015, only 26·1% of second administrative 
level areas recorded an annualised rate exceeding the 
MDG target of 4·4%, whereas at least 60% of these 
locations will need to at least match their current pace to 
make the SDG 3.2 target for under-5 mortality a reality. Of 
particular concern are the areas encompassing nearly 27% 
of Africa’s population that must at least double the MDG 4 
rate to achieve the SDG 3.2 target by 2030, a pace that is 
unprecedented in the last few decades. Envisaging such a 
feat is difficult without the occurrence of substantial 
medical breakthroughs, such as a fully effective malaria 
vaccine,64 or considerably extending access to high-quality 
health care, eliminating risk factors that account for a large 
proportion of child deaths,36 and bolstering socioeconomic

decline required to reach the SDG 3.2 target for under-5 mortality by 2030 (25 deaths per 1000 livebirths). Pixels coloured blue will need to achieve a 4·4% or greater decline per year from 2015 to 2030 to 
achieve the SDG 3.2 target for under-5 mortality. Pixels coloured green to yellow can meet the SDG 3.2 target by 2030 at a pace slower than a 4·4% reduction per year from 2015 to 2030. Pixels with fewer 
than ten people and classified as barren or sparsely vegetated are coloured in grey. Grey areas with diagonal lines are not included in this analysis. SDG=Sustainable Development Goal.

factors that directly affect child survival,7 or all of the above. 
That is not to say achieving SDG3.2 is impossible in Africa, 
since there have been several instances in which the 
introduction and scale-up of cost-effective interventions 
swiftly reduced child mortality in many countries,45 such as 
the expansion of measles immunisation, screening and 
treatment of maternal syphilis during antenatal care, and 
the provision of oral rehydration therapy for severe 
diarrhoea. At a time when precision public health could 
offer transformative power for local intervention design 
and implementation,9,10 these results and initiatives, such 
as EQUIST, which account for subnational variations in 
health, intervention effect 
iveness, and costs, are vital going 
forward in the SDG era. However, staying the current 
course and failing to address more systemic barriers to 
improving child survival will not be sufficient to meet the 
SDG 3.2 target for most of Africa.
 This study offers the analytical framework from which 
we aim to extend geospatial modelling of child mortality 
to an increased number of locations, with a heightened 
focus on estimating specific causes with greater temporal 
resolution. By expanding our high-resolution estimation 
of child mortality to additional high-burden countries 
outside of Africa, we aim to generate estimates in 
locations that represent 95% of under-5 deaths globally.5 
We also intend to disaggregate estimates by year rather 
than by 5-year intervals. Ultimately, our goal is to 
generate cause-specific mortality estimates at the 5 × 5 km 
resolution globally, but this undertaking necessitates 
improved encoding or identification of specific causes of 
death by precise locations. A recent analysis24 produced 
5 × 5 km estimates of malaria mortality in Africa by age 
group,24 including children younger than 5 years, which 
served as an initial foray into this kind of high-resolution, 
cause-specific mortality mapping. Generating pixel-level 
estimates of mortality for children younger than 5 years 
from other causes that disproportionately affect children, 
such as diarrhoeal diseases and lower respiratory 
infections, are also future analytical priorities.
The production of more geospatially granular estimates 
of key child health outcomes hinges upon heightened 
accessibility to and collection of geo-referenced data. 
Increased data availability would both facilitate cause-
specific mortality estimation and reduce uncertainty in 
all-cause estimates, which particularly affect locations 
with substantive geographical or temporal data gaps. In 
an ideal setting, agencies involved in local data collection 
and management would work with the array of data 
users to identify best practices for sharing geo-referenced 
data and thus creating global goods, while maintaining 
privacy and respecting data use agreements. Increasing 
the availability of geolocated data, from surveys to 
censuses to facility records, would greatly strengthen the 
precision of local monitoring of child health needs. By 
highlighting geographical areas where data gaps are 
most strikingly pronounced, we hope to encourage more 
collaboration between data users and providers.
Although household survey and census data offer good 
information on child deaths, they are inferior substitutes 
to high-quality, fully representative vital registration 
systems for providing timely, continuous, and complete 
subnational information on births and deaths. Vital 
registration systems should remain the gold standard for 
routine monitoring of national and local child mortality, 
and in recent years both political and financial invest-
ments in improving vital registration have increased.65–67 
Moreover, SDG indicator 17
.19.2 explicitly outlines targets 
for birth and death registration completeness,3 and efforts 
such as the Bloomberg Data for Health Initiative seek to 
swiftly strengthen existing vital registration systems and 
to help build vital statistics infrastructure in places 
where they are inadequate or non-existent. None 
theless, 
massive disparities persist in birth and death registration 
levels, and Africa has some of the largest gaps in the 
establishment, coverage, and quality of vital registration.68 
Using household survey and census data to inform child 
mortality estimation is likely to be a necessity in many 
parts of the world for the immediate future, but as vital 
registration systems continue to improve, future analyses 
should involve developing methods to integrate vital 
registration data with survey and census data within the 
model-based geostatistics framework.
Our findings should be interpreted within the context of 
some methodological limitations. First, we assumed no 
migration, which implied that all recorded births, deaths, 
and exposures were assumed to occur in the survey 
location. The ability to properly measure and incorporate 
indices of migration has been an enduring challenge for 
large-scale demographic and epidemi 
ological studies,4,5,69,70 
and though innovative efforts such as the WorldPop 
project71 are improving the quantification of population 
movement, they do not yet provide the temporal and 
geographical resolution necessary for our analysis. 
Continued data collation and methodological advances are 
required to appropriately account for migration in 
mortality estimation. Second, we modelled death prob-
abilities in age groups separately, because of software and 
computation limitations. This allowed us to avoid potential 
age-composition bias in small clusters, but ultimately 
meant ignoring a high level of correlation in these data. 
Future work is needed to develop methods that enable 
computationally efficient estimation of the under-5 
survival curve simultaneously rather than approximating 
survival in a piece-wise manner. Third, the included set of 
spatial covariates does not represent the full universe of 
potential corre 
lates for drivers of under-5 mortality 
(eg, exposure to unsafe water and sanitation) because of 
an absence of high-resolution spatial data or layers for 
these particular indicators. As these measures become 
available, future studies should incorporate them into 
modelling ap 
p 
roaches. Fourth, to include a massive 
amount of polygon data in our spatially continuous model, 
we re-sampled polygon data to points. It is possible that 
this procedure introduced over-smooth 
ing, although these

effects are probably minimal given their agreement with 
other subnational mortality models (appendix pp 50–52). 
Future research will need to develop computational meth-
ods for scaling up geostatistical integration of point and 
polygon data to continental-scale mapping studies.72 Last, 
the potential effects of urban slums on child mortality 
were not explicitly quantified. Although our study offers 
the highest geospatial resolution of child mortality to date, 
the 5 × 5 km pixel-level remains too coarse to fully account 
for intra-city slums and disparities.
Amid impressive overall gains in decreasing under-5 
mortality rates in Africa, sizeable populations within the 
continent have yet to experience such improvements in 
child survival. The SDG 3.2 targets for under-5 and 
neonatal mortality demand extraordinary progress in 
child health for Africa—and without substantial, sus-
tained commitments to financing better access to 
improved health care and targeting interventions to high-
burden areas, we are likely to fall short of these aims. 
Monitoring high-resolution trends in child mortality is a 
vital tool for swiftly recognising local child health needs 
and prioritising resources accordingly. With continued 
and expanded mapping efforts, collectively we can garner 
greater recognition of and attention to communities in 
which child survival remains tenuous.
