The origin of Yersinia pestis and the early stages of its evolution are fundamental subjects of
investigation given its high virulence and mortality that resulted from past pandemics.
Although the earliest evidence of Y. pestis infections in humans has been identified in Late
Neolithic/Bronze Age Eurasia (LNBA 5000–3500y BP), these strains lack key genetic
components required for flea adaptation, thus making their mode of transmission and disease
presentation in humans unclear. Here, we reconstruct ancient Y. pestis genomes from
individuals associated with the Late Bronze Age period (~3800 BP) in the Samara region of
modern-day Russia. We show clear distinctions between our new strains and the LNBA
lineage, and suggest that the full ability for flea-mediated transmission causing bubonic
plague evolved more than 1000 years earlier than previously suggested. Finally, we propose
that several Y. pestis lineages were established during the Bronze Age, some of which persist
to the present day.

 Y
ersinia pestis, the causative agent of bubonic, pneumonic
and
septicaemic
plague,
evolved
from
the
closely
related environmental progenitor Y. pseudotuberculosis1.
Although primarily a coloniser of sylvatic rodents via flea-
dependent transmission, ancient DNA studies have demonstrated
its status as an infectious disease in humans for the last 5000
years2,3, and have confirmed its involvement in some of the most
devastating historical pandemics4,5. The first historically recorded
plague pandemic began with the Plague of Justinian (AD
541–543), and persisted until the eighth century AD5,6. The
second pandemic occurred between the 14th and 18th centuries
AD, began with the infamous Black Death of Europe in 13474,7
and was a precursor of modern-day plague epidemics over a wide
geographic range8.
Today, plague has a near-worldwide distribution and is
maintained within sylvatic rodent populations9. Although several
of these rodent reservoirs were established during the third plague
pandemic that began in 19th century China10,11, many of those
identified in Central and East Asia and most notably those of the
Caspian Sea region harbour Y. pestis strains that occupy basal
positions in the global phylogeny (i.e., 0.PE2)12. This supports the
idea of these foci having persisted for millennia12–15. What
remains unknown, however, is the time period and processes
involved in their establishment, and the level of Y. pestis genetic
diversity harboured within them during the early phases of its
evolution.
After its divergence from Y. pseudotuberculosis, Y. pestis
acquired its high pathogenicity and distinct niche mainly by
chromosomal gene loss16 as well as the acquisition of two
virulence-associated
plasmids,
pMT1
and
pPCP11,17,18.
Throughout this process, one of the most crucial evolutionary
adaptations related to its pathogenicity was its ability to colonise
arthropods, a phenotypic/functional gain mediated by a combi-
nation of chromosomal and plasmid loci19,20. These genetic
changes are central to the most common “bubonic” form of the
disease, where bacteria enter the body via the bite of an infected
flea, travel via the lymph to the closest lymph node and replicate
while evading host defences. Recent ancient genomic investiga-
tions of Y. pestis have identified its earliest known variants in
Eurasia during the Late Neolithic/Bronze Age period (LNBA) that
show genetic characteristics incompatible with arthropod adap-
tation. These strains, therefore, have been considered incapable of
an efficient flea-based transmission2; however, the alternative
early-phase transmission could have provided an independent
means of arthropod dissemination2,3,21. To date, the earliest
evidence of a Y. pestis strain with signatures associated with flea
adaptation has been reported during the Iron Age through
shotgun sequencing of an ~2900-year-old genome from Armenia
(strain RISE397), though at a coverage too low (0.25-fold) to
permit
confident
phylogenetic
positioning2.
Although
the
mechanism by which the LNBA lineage caused human disease is
unclear, its frequency in Eurasia during the Bronze Age2,3 and its
phylogeographic pattern that mimics contemporaneous human
migrations are noteworthy3.
The Bronze Age in Eurasia was a period of technological
transition among human populations, often associated with the
initiation of cultural and societal complexity22. Recent aDNA
analysis of human remains from the time period between 5500
and 3200 BP has linked such transitions to a large-scale
expansion of “Yamnaya” pastoralists from the Pontic–Caspian
steppe both westwards into Europe, giving rise to the so-called
“Corded–ware complex”, and eastwards into Central Asia and
the Altai region, represented by Early Bronze Age (EBA)
cultures such as the “Afanasievo”23,24. Specifically in Europe, the
“Yamnaya” migrations resulted in admixture with the local
Neolithic farmer populations, forming the gene pool that appears
to constitute European populations to the present day23–25. In
addition,
recent
studies
propose
subsequent
population
expansions from Europe back into Central Asia during the
Middle and Late Bronze Age (MLBA), which is genetically
reflected by the appearance of European farmer-related ancestry
among Late Bronze Age (LBA) steppe populations such as
“Sintashta”, “Srubnaya”, “Potapovka” and “Andronovo”24,26.
The central steppe region seems to have played a significant
role as a migration corridor during the entire Bronze Age, and as
such, it likely facilitated the spread of human-associated patho-
gens, such as Y. pestis, across Eurasia. Here, we explore additional
Y. pestis diversity in that region by isolating strains from
LBA Samara, in Russia. We identify a Y. pestis lineage
contemporaneous to the LNBA strains with genomic variants
consistent with flea adaptation. This reveals the co-circulation of
two Y. pestis lineages during the Bronze Age with different
properties in terms of their transmission and disease potentials.
Results
Y. pestis and human endogenous DNA screening. We screened
a total of 64 million shotgun next-generation sequencing (NGS)
reads (Supplementary Table 1) from nine teeth of nine indivi-
duals recovered from kurgan burials in the Samara region
(see Supplementary Methods) to assess the endogenous human
DNA content and the possible presence of Y. pestis. Our Y. pestis
screening procedure involved (1) mapping of all reads against the
CO92 reference genome (NC_003143.1), and (2) taxonomically
classifying the reads to bacterial species using the metagenomic
tool MALT27 with a special focus on those assigned to both the
entire Y. pseudotuberculosis complex, as well as Y. pestis specifi-
cally (Supplementary Table 1). As MALT has previously proven
to be an efficient tool in binning reads from complex metage-
nomic datasets into their respective bacterial taxa and has been
successfully used for identifying pathogen DNA in archaeological
material27, we considered individuals as putatively positive only
when reads were assigned to Y. pestis by both conventional
read-mapping and MALT. Our screening revealed four poten-
tially positive individuals (Supplementary Table 1), one of which,
individual RT5 (Fig. 1a), exhibited the highest amounts of
endogenous Y. pestis DNA (0.11%, Supplementary Table 1).
Notably, individual RT5 also exhibited exceptional human DNA
preservation
(31.3%
of
endogenous
DNA,
Supplementary
Table 2). A shotgun-sequencing approach was, therefore, used for
retrieving the entire Y. pestis and human genomes from this
specimen. In addition, an in-solution Y. pestis enrichment
approach was employed for putatively positive individuals.
Human uniparental and genomic analyses. Shotgun sequencing
of RT5 resulted in 1.14 billion raw reads and a 4.2-fold average
human genomic coverage (Supplementary Table 3). Genetic sex
identification assigned RT5 to a male, which is in line with the
anthropological assignment (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Methods).
Nuclear contamination estimates based on X-chromosomal
heterozygosity were low in RT5, estimated at an average of
0.5% (Supplementary Table 4), which permitted the usage of all
generated human data. Y-chromosomal and mitochondrial
assignment revealed the individual carrying R1a1a1b and U2e2a
haplogroups,
respectively
(Supplementary
Methods,
and
Supplementary Table 5). To gain insight into the ancestry of RT5,
we performed principal component analysis (PCA)28–30 and
ADMIXTURE31 analysis, where previously published ancient
Eurasian populations32–35 were used as comparative datasets
(Fig. 1 b, c). Our PCA (Fig. 1b) and ADMIXTURE (Fig. 1b, c)
plots show RT5 to have close genetic affinity to ancient popula-
tions from EBA Europe and the MLBA steppe, which are

 genetically distinct from EBA populations from the Central Asian
steppe, as they encompass early European farmer-related ancestry
as part of their genetic composition (Fig. 1c). Examples of such
groups include the European “Corded Ware”-associated popula-
tions, the “Andronovo” from the Altai region and the Samara-
region “Srubnaya” culture with which RT5 has been archae-
ologically associated.
Y. pestis quality assessment and genome reconstruction.
Although Y. pestis has been previously identified in Bronze
Age individuals2,3, its presence in the Volga region “Srubnaya”-
associated populations has not been characterised to date. After
Y. pestis capture, samples RT5 and RT6 yielded an average
genomic coverage greater than 1-fold, with RT6 reaching 1.9-fold
and RT5 reaching 32.3-fold (Supplementary Table 3). In addition,
we retrieved a 9.2-fold Y. pestis genome from RT5 shotgun
sequencing alone (Supplementary Table 3). Comparison between
the RT5-captured and deep-shotgun-sequenced Y. pestis reads
revealed nearly identical GC contents and deamination profiles
(Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. 1), but sig-
nificantly different read-length distributions (Supplementary
Fig. 2), with an average fragment length increase of 3.6 bp after
capture (t-test, P-value < 2.2e-16). Assessment of SNP profiles
inferred from captured and shotgun-sequenced RT5 reads shows
no
SNP-calling
inconsistencies
between
the
two
datasets
(Supplementary Data 1).
Moreover, during a first assessment of coverage across the
plasmids (Supplementary Table 3), it became apparent that RT5
and RT6 harbour the 1.8 kb Yersinia murine toxin (ymt) gene
locus on the pMT1 plasmid (Fig. 2a), which encodes for a
virulence factor essential for the colonisation of the flea’s midgut.
This gene is absent in all previously sequenced LNBA strains2,3,
though it has been identified in a later Iron Age individual (~2900
BP) from modern-day Armenia (RISE397) (Fig. 2a)2.
Y. pestis phylogenetic analysis. In order to reconstruct a phy-
logeny using a maximum likelihood (ML) approach, we analysed
our RT5 Y. pestis isolate against a total of 177 genomes, including
previously published ancient strains, as well as a worldwide
modern Y. pestis dataset (see Methods and Supplementary
Data 2)2–4,6,8,12,14,15,36. Y. pseudotuberculosis (strain IP32953)18
was used as an outgroup for rooting the tree. Our ML tree
(Fig. 2b) is consistent with previously published phylogenies,
where the LNBA isolates occupy the most basal Y. pestis
branch2,3. Although 14C dates place RT5 within the LNBA time
range (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Table 6), it occupies an unexpected
position in the phylogeny, appearing further derived along branch
0 and being part of a polytomy that gave rise to three independent
lineages (Fig. 2b). We explored the possibility of this polytomy
reflecting a limited phylogenetic resolution at that node, given the
exclusion of missing data (complete deletion) in our analysis. By
contrast, we were able to replicate this topology after inclusion of
all data in our phylogenetic reconstruction (Supplementary
Fig. 3). In addition, since the coverage of RT6 was too low for
confident SNP-calling, its genotype was manually explored after
clipping 2 bp from the 3′ and 5′ ends of all reads to avoid the
interference of post-mortem damage with our SNP assignments
(see Methods). As RT5 possesses five unique, non-homoplastic,
SNPs, we assessed their similarity with RT6. For all such positions
covered in RT6, it possesses the identical SNP genotype as RT5
(Supplementary Table 7), suggesting that the two strains are likely
identical, or are at minimum closely related. Such a result is
expected since the two individuals derive from a double burial
(Fig. 1a).
We further assessed the relatedness of RT5 with the previously
published Iron Age isolate (RISE397)2. The coverage of RISE397
was too low (0.25-fold) to permit robust phylogenetic analysis.
Therefore, manual genotyping of phylogenetically “diagnostic”
SNPs
was
performed
to
infer
its
possible
positioning
(see Methods). As 22.5% of the RISE397 genome was covered
≥1-fold, and only 3.7% of the genome was covered ≥2-fold, we
considered all mapping reads for this analysis. Reads covering
informative positions were authenticated based on whether they
carried diagnostic SNPs or/and carried additional substitutions
that were consistent with terminal deamination, which is
characteristic of aDNA (Supplementary Data 3)37. RISE397
DNA reads cover 26% (12/46) of the diagnostic positions leading
to the RT5 node, making it clearly distinct from the ancestral 0.
PE2 and 0.PE7 genomes since it possesses the derived-state
(CO92 reference) allele in positions where the 0.PE2 and 0.PE7
genomes have ancestral variants (Supplementary Data 3, Supple-
mentary Fig. 4). In addition, 30% (7/23) of SNPs extending from
RT5 to the Justinian 2148 branch were covered in RISE397
(Supplementary Data 4). All such positions were identical to RT5,
exhibiting the ancestral alleles, and hence supporting that
RISE397 is basal to lineage 0.ANT1 (Supplementary Data 3,
Supplementary Fig. 4). Finally, only one of five private-derived
RT5 SNPs was covered in RISE397, where it instead matched the
reference sequence (Supplementary Table 7). Although achieving
a higher coverage would be necessary to verify its precise
positioning, our analysis suggests that RISE397 and RT5 are
closely related strains and potentially originated from the same
progenitor (Supplementary Fig. 4). The node which gave rise to
RT5 and perhaps also RISE397 seems to have initiated a radiation
event that gave rise to all historical and extant Y. pestis lineages
that have been isolated to date, with the exception of the more
basal 0.PE2, 0.PE7 and LNBA (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 4).
Y. pestis divergence time estimates and demographic analysis.
To estimate the time to the most recent common ancestor
(tMRCA) of all Y. pestis strains, we employed the coalescent
constant size, and the coalescent Bayesian skyline models
implemented in BEASTv1.838-40. According to our marginal
likelihood (MLE) estimates computed via path sampling (PS) and
stepping stone sampling (SS)41, the Bayesian skyline model is the
more suitable demographic model for the current dataset
(Supplementary Table 8 and Methods). Nevertheless, both
analyses
produced
overlapping
divergence
date
intervals
(Supplementary Fig. 5). While the constant size method is
unlikely to represent a realistic demographic history model for
epidemic pathogens, it has often been a preferred dating
method2,3,12. Here, it produced a coalescent date estimate of
6797y BP (HPD 95%: 5299–8743) for Y. pestis, which is about
2000 years older than the oldest strains thus far identified2,3
(Supplementary Table 9). In contrast, the coalescent skyline
method, which allows for population size changes through time,
produced a narrower interval and a younger tMRCA estimated
at 5727y BP (HPD 95%: 4909–6842) (Supplementary Fig. 6,
Supplementary Table 9).
In addition, using the Bayesian skyline model, we estimated
effective population size (Ne) changes across the evolutionary
history of Y. pestis. Our skyline plot (Supplementary Fig. 7)
reveals an initial population expansion at ~4000y BP. Such an
increase
corresponds
temporally
with
the
RT5
polytomy
described here (Fig. 2b) that we date to 4011y BP (HPD 95%:
3760–4325) (Supplementary Fig. 6). Although such effect could
arise as a result of sampling bias in the data, it is of note that from
159 modern Y. pestis strains considered for the present analysis,
only 13.2% are phylogenetically ancestral to the described

Y. pestis virulence factor analysis. The presence of several Y.
pestis virulence-associated genes was evaluated in RT5 (Fig. 3).
While the LNBA, 0.PE2 and 0.PE4 strains seem to lack certain
virulence determinants, RT5 harbours all known virulence factors
with the exception of the filamentous prophage (YpfΦ), which is,
however, most consistently identified among 1.ORI strains (Fig. 3,
Fig. 2b)42,43.
Another important gene for Y. pestis virulence is pla located on
the species-specific pPCP1 plasmid44. Although the gene is largely
conserved among Y. pestis strains, an isoleucine (ancestral) to
threonine (derived) alteration at amino acid position 259 has
been used to differentiate the most basal isolates (LNBA, 0.PE7, 0.
PE2 and 0.PE4) from the rest of Y. pestis44. In RT5, the pla
genotype was manually explored, and was found to exhibit the
ancestral allele (Supplementary Fig. 8). Although the ancestral pla
allele has been associated with a less-efficient bacterial dissemina-
tion in mammals44, modern strains from lineages 0.PE4 and 0.

Fig. 2 Y. pestis genomic characterisation and maximum likelihood phylogeny. a pMT1 coverage plots made with the Circos80 software. The plots were
constructed to a maximum coverage of three-fold, and average coverage was calculated over 100-bp windows. The presented strains are in the following
order starting from the outmost: CO92 pMT1 (reference) in grey, the oldest (RISE509) and youngest (RISE505) isolates from the LNBA lineage are shown
in purple, RT5 and RT6 are shown in green, the Iron Age RISE397 isolate is shown in brown, a Justinianic isolate from Altenerding (Germany) is shown in
blue and a London Black Death isolate is shown in red. The position of the ymt gene within the pMT1 plasmid is indicated on the plot. b A worldwide dataset
of Y. pestis ancient and present-day chromosomal genomes (n = 179) was used to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree, considering 1054 SNP positions (see
Supplementary Fig. 3 for a phylogeny using all sites). The main branches were collapsed to enhance the clarity of the phylogeny, and branch lengths are
shown as number of substitutions per site. The newly sequenced RT5 strain (green) was included in the phylogeny alongside eight Bronze Age strains
belonging to the LNBA lineage (purple), a single Justinianic strain (blue), and nine second pandemic strains (red). Asterisks denote bootstrap values >95
(1000 bootstrap iterations carried out). The two-sigma (95.4%) radiocarbon or archaeological dates of Bronze Age and historical strains are shown.

In addition, we manually explored the status of ureD, PDE-2,
PDE-3 and rcsA, all of which have been either lost or inactivated
in Y. pestis by substitution or single-nucleotide InDels. The
inactivation of these genes contributes to Y. pestis’ ability to
colonise, block and be transmitted via fleas (for more details, see
Methods)19,45. Their active variants have been identified in
previously published LNBA strains2,3, thus suggesting either an
inability or a lower efficiency in arthropod-based transmission. By
contrast, we find that RT5 possessed the inactive form of all those
genes, with the exception of a nonsense mutation in PDE-3 where
it shows the ancestral allele (Supplementary Fig. 9). Together with
the active ymt locus on the pMT1 plasmid (Fig. 2a), this suggests
that RT5 was already adapted to the flea vector during the Bronze
Age. Moreover, immune evasion by suppression of flagellar genes
in Y. pestis is considered an important evolutionary advantage
associated to a more complex niche adaptation that is absent in its
closest ancestor Y. pseudotuberculosis46. The flhD regulatory gene
is part of the flhDC operon and is expressed in a temperature-
dependent manner in Y. pseudotuberculosis46, but is inactive in all
extant and historical Y. pestis strains sequenced to date. Although
the strains belonging to the LNBA lineage encompass the active
variant of flhD, RT5 contains the derived, inactive form
(Supplementary Fig. 9).
As presented in the phylogeny (Fig. 2b), RT5 appears closely
related to lineage 0.PE4 also referred to as “microtus”. Since
certain “microtus” strains have been associated with a decreased
pathogenicity in humans, we inspected genes previously identified
as responsible for this phenotype and verified their status in RT5
(Supplementary Table 10)47,48. Some of these loci seem to have
been lost in 0.PE4 (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 10), and
others have been disrupted by insertion sequences (IS) (IS100 and
IS285) or inactivated by substitutions/InDels (Supplementary
Table 10). In RT5, all such genes appear in their active form
(Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 10), and therefore we have no
evidence that this strain had a decreased virulence in humans.
Discussion
Our results contribute to investigations regarding the evolution of
Y. pestis and its disease potential in past human populations. We
used shotgun sequencing and in-solution capture to reconstruct
Y. pestis genomes from Bronze Age individuals (RT5 and RT6) in
the Samara region. In addition, we retrieved a 4.2-fold human
genome from individual RT5 through shotgun sequencing.
Population genetic analysis identified individual RT5 as having
close genetic affinity to EBA European populations and MLBA
populations from the Eurasian steppe region (Fig. 1b). In parti-
cular, we show the presence of Yamnaya-related as well as
farmer-related ancestry in RT5 (Fig. 1c). Our genomic char-
acterisation is in line with previously described BA Eurasian
populations, including “Srubnaya” individuals from Samara26,
where European farmer-related ancestry becomes present in
Central Asia during the MBA as a result of population move-
ments from Europe back into the steppe region24,26.
We
identify
two
~3800-year-old
individuals
(Fig.
1a,
Supplementary Table 3) out of nine analysed that were infected
with Y. pestis at the time of their deaths. The Samara Y. pestis
genomes presented here reveal greater lineage diversity during the
Bronze Age than was previously described. Compared to the
recently published LNBA isolates2,3, RT5 and RT6 form a distinct
branch in the Y. pestis phylogeny (Fig. 2b), deriving from a
polytomy that gave rise to at least three separate lineages, two of
which have persisted to the present day. RT5 falls only five
derived SNPs away from the described polytomy (Supplementary
Table 7). Our dating analyses consistently suggest the presence of
this putative ancestor at ~4000y BP (Supplementary Fig. 6)

Fig. 3 Heat map of coverage across virulence-associated genes. The virulence potential of RT5 shotgun-sequenced and captured genomes is compared to
representative strains from the LNBA lineage, namely, RISE509 (whose virulence profile is identical to that of isolates RK1.001, GEN72, Gyvakarai1 and
Kunila23) and 1343UnTal85 (whose virulence profile is identical to 6Postillionstrasse and RISE5053). In addition it is compared to modern-isolate
representatives 0.PE4-Microtus91001, 0.PE2-PestoidesF and 1.OR1-CO92, and to Y. pseudotuberculosis (strain IP32953). The virulence factors inspected
were located on the Y. pestis chromosome, as well as on the pMT1, pPCP1 and pCD1 plasmids. The percentage of each gene covered (scale bar) was
computed and plotted in the form of a heatmap using the ggplot279 package in R

 followed by a population expansion shortly after that time
(Supplementary Fig. 7). Though its place of origin is not yet
empirically identified, given the close genetic and temporal affi-
nity to RT5 (Fig. 2b), a steppe source is plausible. Given that
previous research has proposed a relationship between rapid Y.
pestis expansions and historical plague epidemics in humans12,
future investigations of lineage diversity from modern and
ancient sources may reveal additional details on this ancient
radiation event.
Apart from RT5, a second known lineage that emerged as part
of the described polytomy is “microtus” (0.PE4)12,49. 0.PE4 is
found today in Central and East Asia, with some isolates being
associated with bubonic plague infections in humans12, and
others being characterised as avirulent to humans47,48,50,51.
Despite the variation in pathogenicity of 0.PE4 isolates, the
phylogenetically related RT5 strain seems unaffected by genetic
alterations/disruptions associated with reduced virulence (Fig. 3,
Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 10). In addition,
the third and most diverse branch established during this radia-
tion event is one that gave rise to a multitude of Y. pestis lineages,
which survive to the present day (Fig. 2b). These include 0.ANT
along with the strain that caused the first historically documented
plague pandemic (Plague of Justinian––sixth century5,6); the
entire branch 1 that includes strains responsible for the second
(Black Death—fourth century)4,8,36 and third (China—19th
century) plague pandemics11 and branches 2, 3 and 4 that are
typically isolated from modern sylvatic rodents in Central and
East Asia (Fig. 2b)11,12.
A recent study has suggested that flea-adapted Y. pestis, along
with its potential to cause bubonic plague in humans, likely ori-
ginated around 3000y BP2. Contrary to such conclusions, the
lineage giving rise to our Y. pestis isolates (RT5 and RT6) likely
arose ~4000 years ago (Supplementary Tables 6 and 9), and
possessed all vital genetic characteristics required for flea-borne
transmission of plague in rodents, humans and other mammals.
These include a fully incorporated ymt locus (Fig. 2a), and the
inactive forms of ureD52, PDE-2, PDE-3 and rcsA genes19, as well
as an inactive flhD flagellin gene (Supplementary Fig. 9). More-
over,
our
analysis
of
the
previously
published
Iron
Age
RISE397 strain from modern-day Armenia2 revealed its close
relationship to RT5 and RT6 (Supplementary Fig. 4). Note that
the modern 0.PE2 and 0.PE7 lineages, which are known to pos-
sess all genomic characteristics that confer adaptation to fleas19,
fall ancestral to RT5 (Fig. 2b) and RISE397 (Supplementary
Fig. 4), but are more derived than the LNBA lineage. Our phy-
logenetic and dating results thus suggest that 0.PE2 and 0.PE7
also originated during the Bronze Age, with their mean diver-
gence here estimated to 4474 (HPD 95%: 3936–5158) and 5237
(HPD 95%: 4248–6346) years BP, respectively, based on the
Bayesian skyline model (Supplementary Table 9). While these
lineages may have been confined to sylvatic rodent reservoirs
during the EBA, the possibility that they co-circulated among
human populations contemporaneously with the LNBA lineage
should be considered. Although the places of origin of 0.PE2 and
0.PE7 are not known, today, their strains are isolated from
modern-day China and the Caucasus region. In terms of their
disease potential, both 0.PE2 and 0.PE7 possess pMT1 plasmids
with fully functional ymt genes, but 0.PE2 strains lack pPCP144,
and though frequently recovered from sylvatic rodent reservoirs,
their virulence in humans is not known. On the other hand, the
more basal 0.PE7 contains pPCP12 and has previously been
associated with human bubonic plague12. It is, therefore, tempt-
ing to hypothesise that efficient flea adaptation in Y. pestis, as well
as the potential for bubonic disease, might have evolved earlier
than 5000 years ago.
Overall, the detection of Y. pestis in Bronze Age human
remains from Eurasia has suggested the presence of the pathogen
in this vast geographic area along with its ability to cause bubonic
plague millennia before the first historically documented plague
pandemic2,3. It seems possible that already in the Bronze Age,
with the establishment of transport and trade networks, the
interconnectivity between Europe and Asia that is also reflected in
the ancient human genomes, likely contributed to the spread of
infectious disease. Similarly, the abundant trade routes of the
medieval period are considered the main conduit for plague’s
movement between Asia and Europe8,12. Our current data suggest
a more complex model, where at least two human-associated
lineages (LNBA and RT5) with different transmission potentials
were established in Eurasia during the Bronze Age (Fig. 2b, c).
Whether these lineages had equal prevalence among human
populations, and the extent to which human practices contributed
to their dissemination, are concepts requiring further investiga-
tion. Additional Bronze Age/Iron Age genomes could provide
further insights into the early stages of Y. pestis evolution, and
help pinpoint key events that contributed to the high virulence
and spread of one of humankind’s most notorious pathogens.
Methods
Sampling and extraction. All laboratory procedures were performed in the
dedicated ancient DNA facilities of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of
Human History in Jena, Germany.
Teeth from nine individuals (one tooth from each), buried in the Mikhaylovka
II tombs of the Samara region in Russia, were sectioned in the cementoenamel
junction using a coping saw and 50–100 mg of dental pulp was removed from each
tooth using a dental drill.
Extraction of 50–60 mg of dental pulp from each tooth sample was performed
using a previously described protocol; optimised for the recovery of short DNA
fragments, most typical of ancient DNA53. An initial lysis step was performed over a
12–16 h incubation of the dental pulp powder in 1 ml of extraction buffer (0.45 M
EDTA, pH 8.0, and 0.25 mg ml−1 proteinase K) at 37 °C. Following extraction,
DNA was bound to a silica membrane using a binding buffer containing guanidine
hydrochloride (protocol previously described in ref. 53) and purified in combination
with the High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Large Volume Kit (Roche). DNA was eluted
in 100 μl of TET (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 and 0.05% Tween20). One
extraction blank and one positive extraction control (previously assessed cave-
bearing specimen) were taken along for the extraction slot.
Illumina library preparation and sequencing. To screen all samples for the
presence of Y. pestis and human endogenous DNA, 10 μl of each extract was
converted into double-stranded Illumina NGS libraries, using a previously
described protocol54, without initial uracil-DNA-glycosylase (UDG) treatment55. A
positive control (cave-bearing specimen) and a negative library control (H2O) were
taken along for the experiment. A total of 1 μl from each library was subsequently
quantified using IS7/IS8 primers. A combination of two unique indexes (8 bp
length of each index sequence) also containing the universal IS5/IS6 priming sites
was assigned to each sample for subsequent multiplex sequencing56. The libraries
were then indexed through a ten-cycle amplification reaction using the Pfu Turbo
Cx Hotstart DNA Polymerase (Agilent). Indexed PCR products were purified using
a Qiagen MinElute kit (Qiagen), eluted in TET (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA,
pH 8.0 and 0.05% Tween20) and then qPCR quantified using IS5/IS6 primers, to
assess the efficiency of the indexing reaction. After this, indexed libraries were
amplified for different amounts of cycles, to achieve a total of 1013 DNA copies per
reaction in order to avoid polymerase saturation and heteroduplex formation. PCR
products were again purified using a Qiagen MinElute kit (Qiagen) and eluted in
TET (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 and 0.05% Tween20). The con-
centration (ng μl−1) of the indexed and amplified libraries was then measured
using a 4200 Agilent Tape Station Instrument (Agilent). Finally, all samples were
diluted and pooled at equimolar ratios to achieve a final 10 nM pool that would
serve as template for sequencing.
In silico screening for Y. pestis reads. The sample pool was single-read
sequenced on a HiSeq 4000 platform using a 1 × 76+8+8 cycles chemistry kit
according to the manufacturer's protocol, to produce between 5,969,436 and
8,215,620 raw demultiplexed reads per sample. Pre-processing of reads was per-
formed using the automated pipeline EAGER v1.9257 to clip adaptors (using Cli-
pAndMerge) and to filter reads for sequencing quality (minimum base quality 20)
and length (keeping all reads ≥30 bp). Mapping was performed using BWA58
implemented in EAGER to Y. pestis CO92 (NC_003143.1), using a –n parameter of
0.01, a –l seedlength of 16 and subsequently using SAMtools to filter for reads with

 a mapping quality (–q) of 37. The MarkDuplicates tool in Picard (1.140, http://
broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) was used to remove duplicates.
In addition, the Megan ALignment Tool (MALT)27 was used to assess the
metagenomic composition of the samples, as well as a screening tool for the
identification of Y. pestis. All bacterial genomes available at GenBank were used as
a reference database for the programme (NCBI RefSeq, December 2015). Pre-
processed reads were used as input for MALT (version 0.3.6), and the parameters
were set to 85 for the minimum percent identity (--minPercentIdentity), 0.01 for
the minimum support parameter (--minSupport), using a top percent value of 1 (--
topPercent) and the semi-global alignment mode. All the remaining parameters
were set to default. The results were viewed in MEGAN659. Putatively positive Y.
pestis samples were evaluated by comparing the amount of reads mapping to Y.
pestis CO92 (NC_003143.1) to the reads assigned by MALT on the Y. pestis and Y.
pseudotuberculosis complex nodes (Supplementary Table 1).
In-solution Y. pestis capture and deep-shotgun sequencing. Rich double-
stranded DNA libraries were prepared for in-solution capture and deep-shotgun
sequencing of putatively positive Y. pestis samples, using 50 μl of extract (or 2 × 25
μl of extract), according to a previously described protocol54, with an initial partial-
UDG treatment step60, where UDG in combination with endonuclease VIII (USER
enzyme, New England Biolabs) were used to remove all deaminated cytosines
(uracils) with the exception of terminal uracil nucleotides that lack 5′ phosphate.
Double-indexing and subsequent library amplification steps were carried out as
mentioned in the previous section “Illumina library preparation and sequencing”.
At this stage, the sample RT5 was diluted to 10 nM for deep-shotgun sequencing
on a HiSeq 4000 platform using a 1 × 76+8+8 cycles chemistry kit. In addition,
1–2 μg of samples RT5 and RT6 were in-solution captured as described previously3,
where a combination of the following Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis genomes
were used as templates for probe design: CO92 chromosome (NC_003143.1),
CO92 plasmid pMT1 (NC_003134.1), CO92 plasmid pCD1 (NC_003131.1), KIM
10 chromosome (NC_004088.1), Pestoides F chromosome (NC_009381.1) and Y.
pseudotuberculosis IP32953 chromosome (NC_006155.1). Samples were captured
in separate wells of a 96-well plate, whereas extraction and library blanks (data not
shown) with non-overlapping index combination were pooled and captured in a
single well. Sequencing was performed on a HiSeq 4000 platform using both single-
end (1 × 76+8+8 cycles) as well as paired-end (2 × 76+8+8 cycles) chemistry kits.
Y. pestis read authentication and genome reconstruction. Sequencing resulted
in up to 1,140,960,213 raw reads per sample. Adaptor trimming of raw, demulti-
plexed, reads was performed using leeHom61. Subsequently, length and quality-
filtering steps were performed in EAGER, as mentioned in the previous section “In
silico screening for Y. pestis reads”. After pre-processing, captured paired-end and
single-end reads from the same individuals were merged into a single file for
mapping. BWA58 integrated in EAGER was used for mapping against the Y. pestis
CO92 reference (NC_003143.1)62 using the following parameters: –n 0.1, –l 32,
and subsequently SAMtools was used to filter for reads with mapping quality of 37
(–q 37). Mean coverages were estimated using QualiMap v.2.2.163 and DNA
deamination profiles typical of aDNA were calculated using MapDamage 2.064.
For genome reconstruction, and for downstream SNP calling, the same pipeline
was followed with a single alteration: after adaptor trimming, reads were inputted
into EAGER and 2 bp were trimmed from each end using ClipAndMerge prior to
length filtering and mapping to eliminate post-mortem damage that might affect
downstream SNP calling.
Read-length comparison of capture and shotgun Y. pestis reads. Two datasets
derived from the same individual (RT5), sequenced using the 1 × 76+8+8 cycles
kit parameters, were used to compare the read-length distributions of shotgun-
sequenced reads and captured reads. For this analysis, datasets were limited to the
same genomic coverage (~9-fold), to ensure uniform comparison and avoid any
biases that might arise from unequal coverage. Reads shorter or equal to 74 bp were
considered for the analysis, to avoid the incorporation of reads that still contain
traces of adaptor, or are longer than 76 bp. Box-plot comparisons and Student's t-
test were calculated using R version 3.4.165.
Y. pestis SNP calling and phylogenetic analysis. For SNP calling, we used the
UnifiedGenotyper of the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK)66. The newly produced
RT5 shotgun-sequenced and captured genomes were analysed alongside 177 pre-
viously published Y. pestis genomes (179 in total), including one previously pub-
lished historical strain from the Plague of Justinian6, nine genomes from the second
plague pandemic4,8,36, eight previously published LNBA genomes2,3 and a global
dataset of 159 modern Y. pestis genomes (Supplementary Data 2)11,12,14,15,47,62,67–
70. A Y. pseudotuberculosis strain (IP32953)18 was used as an outgroup. A vcf file
was produced for every sample using the “EMIT_ALL_SITES” in GATK66, which
generated a call for all positions in the reference genome. In addition, the custom
Java programme MultiVCFAnalyzer v0.8571 (https://github.com/alexherbig/
MultiVCFAnalyzer) was used to produce a combined SNP table, including all
variable positions across our dataset, with the exclusion of previously defined
noncore regions and homoplasies, as well as repeat regions, tRNAs, rRNAs and
tmRNAs11,12. In addition, we used ClonalFrameML72 to identify additional
homoplasies or recombinant regions in our dataset by using a full-genome align-
ment and a RAxML73 ML SNP tree as input, as well as the -em and the -ignor-
e_incomplete_sites options for running the programme. Through this analysis, we
identified seven additional regions (resulting in 26 SNPs) and two homoplastic
SNPs (28 SNPs in total), which were also excluded from the comparative SNP
analysis (Supplementary Table 11). For the remaining data, SNPs were filtered
according to the following criteria: (1) homozygous SNPs and reference alleles were
called when covered at least three-fold with a minimum genotyping quality of 30,
(2) in cases of heterozygous positions, a SNP or reference base was called when
supported by at least 90% of the reads covering the respective position and (3) if
none of the criteria could be fulfilled, a “N” was inserted in the respective position.
A total of 3821 SNP positions were called in the current dataset.
From the resulting SNP alignment, two ML phylogenetic trees were inferred
with RAxML (version 8.2.9)73, using the generalised time-reversible (GTR)
substitution model with gamma-distributed rates (six rate categories). The first
included all data. For the second tree reconstruction, all columns with missing data
were excluded (complete deletion), which resulted in a total of 1054 SNP positions
to be considered for the phylogeny. A total of 1000 bootstrap replicates were
carried out to estimate the topology support of each tree.
In addition, the phylogenetic positioning of RT6 (present study) and RISE3972
was manually explored using the following methods:
●
For RT6: To check whether RT5 and RT6 form the same phylogenetic branch,
SNPs specific to the RT5 genome (n = 5, Supplementary Table 7) were
assessed for their presence in RT6. RT6 possesses four out of five SNP
positions covered at least one-fold. All positions covered encompass identical
alleles to RT5.
●
For RISE397: The SNP table produced by MultiVCFAnalyzer was filtered for
all diagnostic positions leading from the root of the tree towards the RT5 node
(n = 46 SNP positions). In addition, the SNP table was independently filtered
for all positions leading from the RT5 node to the Justinianic node (branch
represented by Justinian 2148 strain) (n = 23 SNP positions), for which RT5
appears to have ancestral alleles. Missing data (N’s) were excluded from this
SNP analysis. The state of all alleles in RISE397 was then manually inspected
using the Integrative Genomics Viewer74. The reads covering all respective
positions were visually authenticated by assessing whether they include
terminal substitutions that could be explained by aDNA damage (Supple-
mentary Data 3, 4).
Divergence date and demographic analyses. TempEst v1.575 was used to assess
for the presence of temporal signal in the dataset. Inclusion of the 14C or
archaeological dates for all ancient isolates resulted in a 0.6 correlation coefficient,
which permitted the proceeding with molecular dating analysis. The software
package BEAST v1.839 was used to estimate the divergence time of Y. pestis
lineages, using the coalescent constant size40 and the coalescent Bayesian skyline38
models. The SNP alignment including only Y. pestis strains was used as input, after
removal of all missing data (complete deletion). The tip dates of all modern Y.
pestis strains were set to 0 years before present (BP). The ages of all ancient and
historical Y. pestis genomes were estimated with their prior uniform distributions
based either on the two-sigma (95.4%) 14C date interval2,3,6 or the archaeological
dates4,8,36 in years BP, as follows: RISE509 (4836–4625, median: 4729), RK1.001
(4828–4622, median: 4720), GEN72 (4833–4592, median: 4721), Gyvakarai1
(4571–4422, median: 4485), Kunila2 (4524–4290, median: 4427), 1343UnTal
(4346–4098, median: 4203), 6Post (3957–3832, median: 3873), RT5 (3868–3704,
median: 3789), RISE505 (3694–3575, median: 3635), London Black Death
(602–604, median: 603), observance (228–230, median: 229), Bolgar 2370
(550–588, median: 569) and Justinian 2148 (1382–1524, median: 1453). In addi-
tion, we used MEGA776 to test whether there is an equal evolutionary rate across
our phylogeny. The strict clock rate was rejected, and therefore we applied a
lognormal relaxed clock77 for all dating analyses, along with the GTR model of
nucleotide substitution (six gamma categories), as previously performed2,3. An ML
phylogeny was reconstructed using RaxML73 and was used as a starting tree. The
LNBA lineage and the rest of Y. pestis strains were constrained to be two separate
monophyletic groups in BEAUti v1.839. A single chain of 300,000,000 states was
run for each model setup, sampling every 10,000 states. In addition, we estimated
MLE using PS/SS sampling41 as part of the same set-up in BEAUTi to assess which
of the two demographic models is best fit for our data. We run this analysis for an
extra 300,000,000 states divided between 100 steps (3,000,000 states each), using an
alpha parameter of 0.3. After run completion, the molecular dating results were
viewed in Tracer v1.6 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/) to ensure that all
expected sample sizes were above 200. TreeAnnotator was used to produce a
maximum clade credibility tree with a 10% burn-in (excluding the first 3000 trees),
which resulted in processing of 27,001 trees for each analysis with a Jeffreys prior
distribution (1.0) for the population sizes. In addition, for the coalescent skyline
analysis, we used 20 as the dimension for the population and group sizes. Once the
chain was complete, we used LogCombiner39 to resample MCMC states at lower

 Analysis of virulence factors. As map-quality filtering may influence read
mappability in certain chromosomal and plasmid regions, we used a mapping
quality filter of 0 (–q parameter) to evaluate the presence or absence of chromo-
somal and plasmid virulence-associated genes in RT5 compared to previously
published modern and LNBA Y. pestis genomes48. Bedtools78 were used to cal-
culate the percentage of gene covered across each region, and a heatmap was
plotted using the ggplot279 package of R version 3.4.165.
In addition, the virulence-associated genes flhD, PDE-2, PDE-3, ureD and rcsA,
which are known to have become inactivated in Y. pestis by either mutation or
single-nucleotide insertions/deletions19, were instead manually explored using
IGV74. Gene flhD, associated with flagellar biosynthesis and whose silencing
contributes to immune evasion, is inactivated by a frameshift caused by a T
insertion, present at position 1,892,659 in CO9246. PDE-2, a phosphodiesterase
gene contributor in biofilm degradation is inactivated by a T insertion in a six-T
stretch at position 1,434,044 in CO92. In addition, PDE-3, also part of the same
biofilm-degradation mechanism, is affected by two mutations, a C > T change (also
called the PDE-pe’ allele19), and a nonsense G > A substitution, which are,
respectively, shown at positions 3,944,166 and 3,944,534 in Y. pseudotuberculosis
IP3295318. The urease enzyme, ureD, that causes toxicity in fleas, is inactivated in
Y. pestis by a G insertion in a six-G stretch, shown at position 2,997,296 in CO92.
Finally, the rcsA gene, a component of the Rcs system that functions as an inhibitor
to biofilm formation, is known to have become inactivated in Y. pestis by a 30 bp
internal duplication, previously described in the strain KIM (NC_004088.1)19.
In addition, as certain Y. pestis strains present in the closely related 0.PE4
“microtus” lineage have been previously associated to a reduced pathogenicity,
genes associated to this attenuated phenotype48 were explored in RT5, in relation
to 0.PE4. The following regions were integrated into the presence/absence heatmap
analysis described previously, as they are absent in microtus: YPO1986 to
YPO1987, YPO2096 to YPO2135, YPO2469, YPO2487 to YPO2489 and YPO3046
to YPO3047 (region annotations are given as they appear in CO92) (Fig. 3).
Additional genes, which appear to have been disrupted by IS elements, or by
mutations/InDels (Supplementary Table 9), were visually inspected in
IGV (Supplementary Fig. 10)74.
Data availability. Raw sequencing data of the deep-sequenced RT5 and RT6
isolates have been deposited into the European Nucleotide Archive under project
accession number PRJEB24296. Other data supporting the findings of the study are
available in this article and its Supplementary Information files, or from the cor-
responding authors upon request.
