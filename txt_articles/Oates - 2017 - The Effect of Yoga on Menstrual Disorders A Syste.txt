The Effect of Yoga on Menstrual Disorders:
A Systematic Review
Jennifer Oates, PhD, MA, PGCert, BA, Dip HE, RMN
Abstract
Objective: To summarize and evaluate evidence for the effect of yoga on menstrual disorders.
Methods: PubMed, CINAHL/MEDLINE, Web of Science, AMED, and Scopus were searched for English-
language literature relevant to the review question. All primary research studies were included.
Results: Fifteen studies described in 18 papers were included in the review. A range of yoga interventions
were used. Some studies used a combination of Asana, Pranayama, and other yogic relaxation or meditation
techniques. All included studies reported some change in their outcome measures, suggesting reduced symp-
toms of menstrual distress following a yoga intervention; however, the heterogeneity and intensity of the
interventions and outcome measures meant that findings have limited generalizability and applicability in
practice settings.
Conclusions: Further research on the relationship between yoga practice and menstrual disorders is war-
ranted, but there must be both consistency in the methods, measures, and quality of studies and a shift toward
research on yoga practices that are replicable outside of the clinical trial setting.

Introduction
T
his article reviews the evidence for the effect of
yoga practice on common menstrual disorders in pre-
menopausal women. Common primary menstrual disorders
include amenorrhea (lack of menstruation), oligomenorrhea
(irregular menstruation), dysmenorrhea (painful menstrua-
tion), premenstrual syndrome (PMS, which incorporates
cyclical psychological and physical symptoms), and pre-
menstrual dysphoric disorder (a severe form of premenstrual
syndrome).1 Menstrual disorders are common. Prevalence of
PMS and premenstrual dysphoric disorder have been re-
ported as ranging from 5% to 8%.2 Prevalence rates for
dysmenorrhea range from 16% to 91%.3 Surveys of women
in developing countries, the United States, Europe, and
Australia have found that 5%–20% of women report dys-
menorrhea to the extent that it stops them from participating
in usual activities.4 Menstrual disorder is also a component of
the female athletic triad (along with osteoporosis and disor-
dered eating), the prevalence of which among female athletes
is between 0% and 15.9%.5 Where medical assessment and
treatment of menstrual disorders should in the first instance
establish whether they are secondary to other conditions
(such as polycystic ovarian syndrome, thyroid problems,
menopause, or pregnancy),6 many women choose to manage
their menstrual problems through the use of complementary
and alternative therapies, including the practice of yoga.7–9
Background
Yoga is a term used to describe a variety of practices,
although its literal translation in Sanskrit means ‘‘yoke’’ or
‘‘union.’’10 Yogic practices may include physical exercises
(Asanas), breathing exercises (Pranayama), relaxation tech-
niques, and meditation or concentration practices, including
yoga Nidra (a form of guided relaxation practice). There are
many different types of yoga, according to different schools
or traditions (for example the Asana-heavy styles of yoga
practiced often in the West according to the teachings of
three pupils of Krishnamacharya (1889–1989): the school of
BKS Iyengar,11 Ashtanga Vinyasa yoga of Patthabi Jois,12
and the Viniyoga of Desikachar13). Yoga practice in the
modern context is primarily focused on Asana as a physical
exercise regimen, whereas traditionally, and certainly before

 the mid-20th century, yoga has been more widely associated
with spirituality and contemplation, with Asana practice
being a less prominent aspect.14
Research on yoga as a therapeutic intervention grows
apace,15–17 although the variability in study quality, inter-
ventions, and outcome measures means that the extent to
which yoga practice may positively affect health cannot yet
be definitively stated.15,16 The mechanism by which yoga
may improve health is commonly considered to be its effect
on the autonomic stress response.18 Yoga-based practices
affect a complex series of physiologic and cognitive mecha-
nisms, which in turn may affect aspects of self-regulation
of stress.19–21
A recent attempt to define a comprehensive theoretical
framework from which hypotheses on how bottom-up neu-
rophysiologic and top-down cognitive mechanisms may
explain the effect of yoga on well-being has differentiated
between the effects of the movement, breath and attention
aspects of practice.19 It has also differentiated between
several neurologic and physiologic processes that may be
involved in self-reported changes in the well-being of yoga
practitioners. These include the effect of yoga movement on
the basal ganglia and cerebella circuits; the influence of
yoga breathing practices on concentrations of oxygen and
carbon dioxide in the blood; and the effect of the attention
element of practice, akin to other meditative activities, on
structural changes in parts of the brain responsible for bodily
awareness.
Alongside the exponential increase in yoga research,
there has been ‘‘a parallel surge’’ in yoga practice.16 De-
mographic surveys of yoga practitioners in the United States
have found yoga practitioners to be more likely to be white,
female, highly educated, and middle aged.22,23 As well as
the trial-based evidence showing that yoga may positively
affect health, in particular the psychology and physiology of
stress, there are practical benefits to suggesting yoga as an
intervention for menstrual disorders: It is not costly, requires
no equipment, and is readily available (there are classes in
most cities, and yoga tutorials are available online). A recent
meta-analysis of clinical trials found yoga to be as safe as
usual care or exercise.24
A relationship between yoga Asana practice and men-
strual disorder symptoms has been established in both the
nonacademic popular literature and in yoga manuals. In the
grey nonacademic literature (namely, the plethora of yoga
websites and magazines and mentions of yoga on health and
well-being websites), there is evidently an association be-
tween frequent yoga practice and oligomenorrhea, and the
possible effects of yoga on menstrual disorders (a Google
search of ‘‘yoga AND menstrual disorders’’ yielded about
340,000 results on November 6, 2016, and a search of ‘‘yoga
AND oligomenorrhea’’ yielded about 36,000 results on
November 6, 2016).
Commonly in yoga manuals and instructional articles,
women are advised to refrain from certain Asanas, such as
the inversion postures Sirsasana (headstand) or Sarvanga-
sana (shoulder stand) during menstruation,25 whereas in the
Ashtanga Vinyasa tradition of Patthabi Jois,12 women are
advised to refrain from Asana practice in the first 3 days of
menstruation off from practice.26 Popular yoga manuals
offer women specific sequences to be undertaken during
menstruation. For example, Geeta Iyengar’s Yoga: A Gem
for Women27 recommends a sequence including Upavistha
Konasana and Baddha Konasana to ease dysmenorrhoea,
and Judith Hanson Lasater offers a sequence for menstru-
ating women in The Moon Club: Honouring the Monthly
Cycle,28 which aims to assist the body in releasing menstrual
flow, reducing fatigue, and moderating hormonal shifts. Like
Iyengar, her sequence is based around versions of Baddha
Konasana and Upavistha Konasana. The sequence of postures
recommended for menstruation on the online Yoga Journal
site29 include Baddha Konasana, Dhanurasana (the bow),
Setu Bandha Sarvangasana (bridge pose), Ustrasana (the
camel), dolphin, and Adho Mukha Svanasana (downward
dog). The PopSugar lifestyle site article ‘‘Skip the Ibuprofen
and Do These Yoga Poses to Ease Period Pain’’30 suggests a
‘‘half bound squat’’ (Malasana), arching pigeon (Kapotasana),
one-armed camel (Ustrasana), a wide child’s pose (Balasana),
and a reclining twist, although the first three of these poses are
rather advanced and would probably not be taught in a be-
ginner’s class.
The aim of this review was to assess the evidence for
correlations between yoga practice and various forms of
menstrual disorder and to identify which forms of yoga have
been evaluated as interventions for menstrual disorders. The
review also aimed to evaluate the published primary re-
search evidence for the efficacy of yoga as an intervention
for treating menstrual disorders. Does published research
evidence accord with yoga wisdom, as reflected in journals,
websites, and instruction manuals?
Methods
This study was a systematic literature review of primary
research on the effect of yoga on menstrual disorders. A
search was conducted of the English-language literature
between 1996 and 2016. The following databases were
searched: PubMed, CINAHL/MEDLINE, Web of Science,
AMED, and Scopus. The following search terms were used:
‘‘Yoga AND menstruation OR menstrual period OR men-
arche; Yoga AND amenorrhea; Yoga AND dysmenorrhea.’’
Studies were included if the following criteria were met:
primary research, on premenopausal women, and under-
taking yoga practice. Studies were excluded if their partic-
ipants were menopausal women, if yoga was not the
intervention being undertaken. and if the study did not
consist of primary research. This study aimed to compre-
hensively review all research literature on the effect of yoga
on menstruation, not just evidence from randomized con-
trolled trials (RCTs), so all types of primary research study
were included.
One reviewer reviewed each paper by using a standard-
ized data extraction form. Extracted data included authors,
year of publication, sample size, interventions, main out-
comes, and adverse events. The data extraction process is
detailed in Figure 1.
The methodologic quality and risk of bias of the included
studies were measured by using the Critical Appraisal Skills
Programme (CASP) criteria31 and the Cochrane Handbook
for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (version 5.0.2).32
The following domains of bias were reviewed: random se-
quence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of
participants and personnel, incomplete outcome data, se-
lective reporting, and other sources of bias.

 Results
Fifteen studies described in 18 papers were included in
the review. The year of publication, authors, study design,
sample size, age of participants, intervention modality, in-
tervention dosage, outcome measure, and salient findings for
each study are reported in Table 1. Three were case-control
trials comparing women with menstrual disorders and
healthy women. Nine studies were RCTs. Three were in-
tervention studies. Eight studies were conducted in India;
three were conducted in Taiwan; and one each was con-
ducted in Iran, Japan, and Korea. The included studies
measured the effect of yoga on premenstrual symptoms and
menstrual distress. No studies measured the effect of yoga
on amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea. No studies measured the
effect of yoga on menstruation in women who were regular
yoga practitioners.
Participant characteristics and recruitment
The age range of female participants in the studies varied
between 13 and 45 years. In two studies, participants were
adolescent girls who attended residential colleges.33,34 Other
studies recruited participants through referral from and atten-
dance at gynecology clinics,35–40 on students at a metropolitan
college,41 students on a physiotherapy course,42 female vol-
unteers with no stated specific origin,43 unmarried medical
students,44 students,45 nursery and kindergarten teachers,46
staff and students at a university,47 female workers at an
electronics factory,48 college students,49 and nursing college
students.50
Interventions
A range of yoga interventions were used. Some studies
used a combination of Asana, Pranayama, and other yogic
relaxation or meditation techniques. Two studies35–39 mea-
sured the sole impact of Yoga Nidra practice. One study46
measured the effect of three specific yoga Asanas (cobra,
cat, and fish). In other studies, a range of Asana were
practiced. The length of the yoga practice sessions differed
between studies, from 10 minutes42 to 90 minutes.40 Fre-
quency of practice ranged from daily for 16 weeks40 to 20
minutes for 14 days.45 In one study,46 participants were
taught the Asana routine and then given a DVD to use for

 home practice. In the other studies, instruction was provided
in a class setting. One study42 compared the efficacy of two
Pranayama techniques. In another study,34 the control group
undertook nonyogic exercise, breathing and resting at the
same time as the yoga intervention group. The control
groups in the other RCTs and case-control studies did not
take part in a control intervention.
Outcome measures
There was little consistency between studies in the out-
come measured used. Some studies used versions of the
Moos Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (MDQ);51 others
used pain scales, primarily the Visual Analogue Scale for
Pain52 and general quality of life and stress scales (Table 1).
Mood scales and mental health scales were also used. In
some studies, physiologic assessments were used as objec-
tive measures of impact and to identify underlying mecha-
nisms for the potential effect of yoga on menstrual distress.
These included the use of resting electrocardiography, body
mass index, hand grip and reach tests, autonomic function
tests, and serum levels of hormones at certain points in the
menstrual cycle.
Findings
All studies reported a beneficial effect of yoga as an inter-
vention for menstrual disorders. Yoga practice was associated
with lower MDQ scores,41,50 lower serum homocysteine,41
lower negative affect,40 reduced pain scores,42–44,48 increased
well-being scores,38,43 autonomic system changes,33,35–37 a
heightened relaxation response,47 and decreased menstrual
disorder symptoms.48 No study concluded that yoga had no
effect on menstrual disorder symptoms.
Only one study38 reported an adverse effect of the yoga
intervention; namely, one participant dropped out because of
‘‘nonrestorative sleep’’ following the yoga Nidra practice.
Only three studies confirmed no adverse effects of the prac-
tice (because of reporting of the included studies).40,45,49 In
all other studies there was no mention of adverse effects or
affirmation of their being no adverse effects.
Quality of studies
The quality of studies was assessed by using CASP cri-
teria.31 All studies gave clear statements of their methods
and aims. Recruitment strategies, data collection, and
analysis methods were stated. Two studies39,40 did not state
that it had been approved by an ethics committee or insti-
tutional review board. All studies described the use of ap-
propriate statistical analysis techniques.
While the research methods and aims were replicable,
description of the yoga intervention used varied, limiting the
replicability of the intervention in future research. Most
studies described the specific Asana used in their interven-
tion, with the exception of Nidhi et al.34 and Sakuma et al.46
The studies focused on Yoga Nidra as an intervention35–37,39
did not give detail of how Yoga Nidra was instructed or
performed. There was limited discussion of the rationales
for the specific Asana and Pranayama chosen for the in-
terventions.
High risk of bias was identified in three studies33,40,48
(Table 2) due to high attrition rates, lack of description of
randomization methods, and sole use of subjective self-
report methods to measure outcomes. Given the nature of
the interventions, it was not possible to blind participants to
their allocation or the intervention. Where several studies
used self-report measures, such as pain analogue scales,
there was a risk of bias in outcome assessment.
While all studies reported some positive effect of yoga on
menstrual distress, as reported by participants and as found
by assessing physiological correlates of menstrual distress,
the external validity of the studies is limited by the frequency
of the interventions used, with daily practice under instruction
being an unrealistic expectation of most working-age women.
This concern has also been raised in a review of yoga for
menopausal symptoms.53 No studies included long-term
follow-up, meaning that the continued effect of the inter-
vention was not measured.
Discussion
Yoga is a term used to describe a range of practices,
following a number of traditions of schools.10 The findings
of this review mirror those of systematic reviews of yoga for
other health conditions, in that the positive outcomes of
individual studies must be countered by concerns about their
lack of replicability and their heterogeneity.12,48,49 Yoga
practice is growing exponentially,24 particularly in the
population most likely to experience menstrual distress:
women of childbearing age.
The complex mechanisms by which yoga practice may
affect the person cognitively and physiologically, with an
assumed impact on the stress response, have been noted
earlier.19–21 The effect of yoga specifically on the underlying
mechanisms of menstrual disorder is therefore hard to de-
termine here. The reduction of menstrual disorder symptoms
(as reflected in pain or well-being scores) may be due to a
generic effect of yoga on pain tolerance and stress reduction,
rather than an impact on underlying causes of menstrual
disorder, such as hormone imbalance, for example.
While the studies did discuss the possible and previously
trialed benefits of yoga, there was no rationale for the spe-
cific regimens that were followed: neither the sets of pos-
tures used in the interventions nor the duration and
frequency of the intervention. In the studies that used a
limited and specific practice, for example, Yoga Nidra35,36–39
or the comparison of two types of Pranayama,42 there was
not a justification for these practices over others in the yoga
pantheon. The exception is Rakhshaee and colleagues’
study45 using three specific poses. Their use is justified
because of the action of the cobra pose on spinal flexibility
and muscular strength, the cat pose on movement and breath
coordination, and the fish pose on relief of stiffness and
improvement of flexibility. The mechanism by which these
proposed effects address menstrual disorder requires further
inquiry, however.
All included studies reported some change in their out-
come measures suggesting reduced symptoms of menstrual
distress following a yoga intervention; however, the inter-
ventions and outcome measures used varied considerably.
Several studies documented the effect of intensive programs
of daily yoga that may be difficult to sustain outside of the
college or industrial settings of the studies, whereby the
same groups of women could be present in the same place

 for several days in a week. Among the 18 studies there was
limited parity of intervention or outcome measure. Most
studies measured the effect of yoga on an intervention group
with no prior experience of yoga practice, meaning that the
influence of yoga on menstruation over the long term or in
regular practitioners was not gauged. Frequency of practice
is a predictor of good health and high subjective well-being
in established practitioners;22 however, the regimens de-
scribed for yoga novices in some studies in this cohort were
particularly intensive.33,34,40,43,44 There is scope for future
research that both controls for the effect of frequency and
duration of practice on menstrual disorders and explores the
specific influence of frequency and duration.
Another main methodologic drawback is lack of com-
prehensive reporting of trial methods and heterogeneity of
interventions, as has been identified in reviews of yoga for
depression,54,55 weight management,56 and menopausal
symptoms.53 A recent comprehensive review of research on
yoga 2010 to 2016 concluded that RCTs should compare
yoga to other forms of exercise and that physiologic tests to
identify underlying mechanisms should be used rather than
self-reported measures.15 Recent systematic review and
meta-analyses of yoga intervention studies for physical and
mental health conditions have also called for a more so-
phisticated approach, whereby aspects of the practice and
characteristics of different practitioners are explored.
Strengths and weaknesses
This was the first systematic review of studies of yoga and
menstrual disorders in women of childbearing age, including
RCTs. A limitation of this review was the lack of eligible
studies and lack of similarity between studies. Another
limitation was the restriction to English-language studies.
There was no research available on amenorrhea and yoga or
oligomenorrhea and yoga. Evidence from yoga manuals,
Internet searches, and the nonacademic literature suggests
that the effect of yoga practice on menstrual disorders may
well extend beyond it being a possible treatment, and that
frequent practice may be implicated in the genesis of
menstrual disorders as well as potentially relieving them.
Such a relationship has not been explored in primary
research.
Implications for further research
The results of the studies included here suggest that
further research is warranted. There is a need for consis-
tency of measurement and intervention in studies of the
efficacy of yoga for menstrual disorders. Long-term
follow-up should be included in research designs. The ef-
fect of different aspects of yoga practice (Asana, Pra-
nayama, Yoga Nidra, relaxation, and meditation) as well as
the different styles of yoga should be compared, rather than
treated as one intervention. Yoga interventions should be
designed to be realistically followed by working-age wo-
men so that they may be generalized to the wider popu-
lation. There have been no studies in this field on western
women. No baseline studies have measured the presence of
menstrual disorders in regular yoga practitioners. Of par-
ticular interest is the extent of amenorrhea or oligome-
norrhea in frequent practitioners of the more strenuous
forms of yoga, such as Ashtanga.
Future studies should follow rigorous reporting and
methodologic standards, meaning that their design should
address risks of bias, particularly in randomization, outcome
measures used, and reporting bias. The challenge of allo-
cation concealment and blinding of participants should be
acknowledged.
Conclusion
This systematic review found several studies presenting
evidence for the effectiveness of yoga as an intervention for
symptoms of menstrual disorder. The lack of consistency in
the interventions and outcome measures used precluded
meaningful meta-synthesis. No studies have looked at the
long-term effects of yoga practice on menstrual disorders or
the prevalence of menstrual disorders in long-term yoga
practitioners. The results of this review suggest that further
research on yoga for menstrual disorders is warranted, so
long as both methodologic standards are met and the study
design enables generalizability to the target population.
