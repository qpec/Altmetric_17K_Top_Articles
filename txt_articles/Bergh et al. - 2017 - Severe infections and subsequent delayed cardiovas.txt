Abstract
Background: Severe infections in adulthood are associated with subsequent short-term cardiovascular disease.
Whether hospital admission for sepsis or pneumonia is associated with persistent increased risk (over a year after
infection) is less well established.
Design: The design of this study was as a register-based cohort study.
Methods: Some 236,739 men born between 1952–1956 were followed from conscription assessments in adolescence
to 2010. All-cause cardiovascular disease (n ¼ 46,754), including coronary heart disease (n ¼ 10,279) and stroke
(n ¼ 3438), was identified through national registers 1970–2010 (at ages 18–58 years).
Results: Sepsis or pneumonia in adulthood (resulting in hospital admission) are associated with increased risk of
cardiovascular disease in the years following infection. The risk is highest during the first year after the infection, with
an adjusted hazard ratio (and 95% confidence intervals) of 6.33 (5.65–7.09) and a notably increased risk persisted with
hazard ratios of 2.47 (2.04–3.00) for the second and 2.12 (1.71–2.62) for the third year after infection. The risk
attenuated with time, but remained raised for at least five years after infection; 1.87 (1.47–2.38). The results are adjusted
for characteristics in childhood, cardiovascular risk factors and medical history in adolescence. Similar statistically sig-
nificant associations were found for coronary heart disease and stroke.
Conclusions: Raised risks of cardiovascular disease following hospital admission for sepsis or pneumonia were
increased for more than five years after the infection, but with the highest magnitude during the first three years
following infection, suggesting a period of vulnerability when health professionals and patients should be aware of the
heightened risk for cardiovascular disease.

Introduction
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a leading cause
of death and disability globally.1 There is evidence of
an association with some infections and a raised risk
of CVD. Several studies have reported an increased risk
of CVD during, or shortly after, hospital admission for
acute infection,2–5 and other studies suggest that vac-
cination against influenza and pneumonia may protect
against CVD.6,7 What is less established is whether a
raised CVD risk remains in the years following severe
infections and if there is a period of particularly heigh-
tened risk. Infections can result in local and systemic
inflammation, coagulation disturbances, induce ischae-
mia, endothelial dysfunction and cause inflammatory
changes in atherosclerotic plaques.8–10 Inflammation
is regarded as playing a central role in the atheroscler-
otic
process

 progression and rupture of plaques.11 Alone, or in com-
bination, these effects may increase the short-term risk
of cardiovascular events.12 As heightened systemic
inflammatory and pro-coagulant activity can persist
long after infections resolve,13 the effect of infections
on CVD risk could also extend for several years.
However, only a few studies have reported associations
between severe infections and subsequent long-term
risk of CVD.14–17 Lee et al.15 only investigated stroke
as an outcome, while Corrales-Medina et al.14 investi-
gated pneumonia as the exposure, and the research by
Ou et al.16 and Jafarzadeh et al.17 was concerned with
sepsis and bacteraemia. We investigated both types of
exposure as they appear to represent similar risks for
CVD. Unlike the work presented here and by Corrales-
Medina et al.,14 neither of the two latter studies char-
acterised risk year-by-year immediately after infec-
tion,16,17

of
particularly raised risk. None of these recent14–17 stu-
dies examined directly whether the persistent raised risk
following infection was due to reinfection by severe
sepsis, bacteraemia or pneumonia, we investigated
this potential explanatory mechanism.
This study examined if severe infections are asso-
ciated with an increased risk of CVD in the years
following
infection,
from
adolescence
up
to
late
middle-age, at which ages CVD can have particularly
devastating consequences. We selected sepsis and pneu-
monia (including bacteraemia) resulting in hospital
admission as relatively common severe infections that
have the potential to induce persistent inflammatory
and other immunological changes.18 The outcomes
are all CVD, as well as stroke and coronary heart
disease (CHD) to focus on more aetiologically homo-
geneous disease groups where influences on atheroscler-
otic processes are of particular relevance. We used
information from a general population-based national
cohort of men resident in Sweden.
Methods
Study population
The study population is a cohort of men who were born
between
1952–1956
and included
in the
Swedish
Military Conscription Register at a time when conscrip-
tion was compulsory for all male Swedish citizens.
The conscription assessment took place in late adoles-
cence, at an average age of 18 years. All eligible men
underwent extensive physical and psychological exam-
inations by physicians and psychologists as part of the
conscription assessment. Only men with significant dis-
ability or those in prison (2–3% annually) were exempt
from conscription examinations. From among 284,198
men,
we
made
exclusions
as
detailed
in
the
Supplementary Material. The final study population
comprised 236,739 men.
Infections. Infection diagnoses were obtained through
the Swedish National Patient Register, which has rec-
orded all inpatient diagnoses since 1964, with complete
coverage
from
1987.
We
used
the
International
Classification of Diseases (ICD)-8, 9 and 10 codes
(see Supplementary Material) to identify all discharge
dates for inpatient diagnoses of pneumonia, sepsis and
bacteraemia.
CVD. CVD diagnoses were obtained using the National
Patient Register and the Cause of Death Register. The
ICD codes used for CVD, CHD and stroke are pre-
sented in the Supplementary Material.
Charlson Comorbidity Index. For a sensitivity analysis with
later entry to follow-up in adulthood, we used data on
diagnoses in the National Patient Register recorded by
1987, to calculate a Charlson Comorbidity Index score
to measure burden of disease (see Supplementary
Material).
Characteristics
in
adolescence. Physical
and
cognitive
function and any medical diagnoses by adolescence
were assessed as part of the military conscription exam-
ination.19 Psychologists systematically assessed poten-
tial conscripts for their predicted ability to cope with
stress. Using a semi-structured interview, a stress resili-
ence score (1–9) was derived. Body mass index (BMI)
was categorised using the World Health Organisation
(WHO) criteria. Resting recumbent blood pressure was
measured using a sphygmomanometer. Physical work-
ing capacity was assessed using a cycle ergometer test.
A cognitive function score was calculated from a writ-
ten assessment comprising four domains: linguistic
understanding, spatial recognition, general knowledge
and ability to follow technical instructions. Erythrocyte
sedimentation rate (ESR) is a marker of inflammation,
measured
at
conscription
using
the
Westergren
method.20 ESR was categorised in three groups and
adjusted for erythrocyte volume fraction.21 Health
status was determined by a medical assessment, where
physicians performed an examination and collected a
detailed medical history and classified men by the sever-
ity of health problems. This assessment produced a
score of 0–9, where nine indicated no diagnosis
and zero indicated a very significant health problem.
All diagnoses were recorded using ICD-8 codes.

Total Population Register combines information from
several sources held by the government organisation,
Statistics Sweden, and provides dates of birth, death

 and emigration: these data were used for censoring
prior to or during follow-up. The Population and
Housing Census in 1960 provided socioeconomic infor-
mation for parental occupations to create a socioeco-
nomic index (SEI) classified as manual, agricultural,
farm
owners/managers,
office
workers,
business
owners/managers and others. Household crowding
was based on the person per habitable room ratio
and dichotomised into fewer than two persons per
room, or more people per room.
Statistical analysis
Cox regression was used to investigate the associations
of first serious infection (sepsis or pneumonia resulting
in hospital admission) in adulthood with subsequent
CVD risk, with separate analyses for all-cause CVD,
CHD and stroke. Infection diagnoses were modelled
as time-dependent exposures, and the outcome was
identified at pre-specified time intervals post-infection
(0–1, >1–2, >2–3, >3–4, >4–5 and, 5þ years after
hospital admission for the infection). Attained age
was used as the underlying time scale. For the main
analysis, follow-up started from the conscription assess-
ment (earliest in 1969) and ended on the date of first
diagnosis of CVD, CHD or stroke; death, emigration
or 1 January 2010, whichever occurred first. Cohort
members were excluded if they had received a diagnosis
of CVD, sepsis or pneumonia (recorded in the patient
or conscription registers) by the time of conscription
assessment. Adjustment was for SEI, crowding and
region of residence in 1960; and summary disease
score, ESR and erythrocyte volume fraction (EVF),
BMI, stress resilience, systolic blood pressure, diastolic
blood pressure, physical working capacity and cogni-
tive function at the conscription assessment in adoles-
cence. The covariates were included for the following
reasons. Some diseases in adolescence may raise the risk
of both infections and CVD. Physical working capacity
and blood pressure are associated with CVD risk and
were included to improve precision of the estimates.
A measure of smoking was not available, so we
included markers of social, physical and psychological
characteristics that signal behaviour, relevant to CVD
and infection, such as smoking: stress resilience, cogni-
tive function, BMI; household crowding and parental
SEI (markers of childhood disadvantage). ESR indi-
cates system inflammation which is associated with
CVD risk and can also indicate immune dysregulation
and infection risk. Raised ESR has also been linked
with smoking, but not always.22 All of these measures
are statistically significantly associated with both sepsis
and pneumonia in our material, so may be potential
confounding factors. Sensitivity analysis examined if
the delayed association between first infection and
CVD is explained by subsequent severe infections con-
temporaneous with the CVD event, where all – not just
the first – sepsis and pneumonia diagnoses are included
in the adjusted model as time-dependent exposures.
Infections were considered as new-onset if diagnosed
more than 30 days after discharge for the previous
episode.
Another sensitivity analysis investigated the possible
confounding influence of chronic disease in adulthood.
The later follow-up began from 1987 (ages 31–35 years)
with
additional
adjustment
for
the
Charlson
Comorbidity Index score based on diagnoses recorded
up to this time, as well as all of the measures included in
the main analysis. Men with CVD, sepsis or pneumonia
diagnoses by 1987 were excluded. Sensitivity analyses
for the associations with sepsis and pneumonia separ-
ately were also performed. Statistical significance was
defined as p < 0.05 and all analyses were conducted
using Stata V.13 SE.
Ethical permission
The study was approved by the Regional Ethics
Committee in Uppsala, Sweden (Dnr 2014/324).
Results
The study included 236,739 men. During the follow-up
period from conscription assessment, typically in late
adolescence, to 2010, 46,754 men (19.7%) received a
first diagnosis of CVD by age 58 years, including
10,279 with CHD (4.3%) and 3438 (1.5%) with
stroke. A total of 9987 hospital admissions for pneu-
monia or sepsis were identified among 8534 men. As
shown in Table 1, men in the cohort were ostensibly
healthy at the conscription assessment, with most
recorded as either having no diagnosis (45.3%) or no
serious medical problem (38.6%). Men with CVD in
adulthood were more likely to have parents with a
lower socioeconomic index in 1960 and greater house-
hold crowding in childhood. They tended to have lower
levels of physical working capacity, lower cognitive
function scores, poorer stress resilience, higher levels
of ESR and obesity, as well as a higher proportion
with diagnoses in adolescence and young adulthood.
Before and after adjustment, the highest magnitude
association with an increased risk of CVD is during the
first year after first infection (with an adjusted haz-
ard ratio (HR) and confidence interval (CI) of 6.33
(5.65–7.09)) and a notably raised risk persists over
two years after infection (2.47 (2.04–3.00)), then the
magnitude attenuates with time but remains statistically
significant and does not return to unity after five years
(1.56 (1.46–1.67)) (Table 2). As expected, raised risks
for CVD are associated with the following factors

 in adolescence: higher ESR, higher blood pressure,
overweight and obesity, low stress resilience, poorer
cognitive function, poorer physical fitness and diag-
noses influencing daily life. In childhood, manual par-
ental occupations and greater household crowing are
associated with raised CVD risk. None of the other
measures had associations with CVD of as high mag-
nitude as those for three years following infection.
Broadly similar results for the infections and other
measures were observed for the CHD outcome sub-
group (Supplementary Material, Table S1), stroke
(Supplementary Material, Table S2) and for fatal
CVD (Supplementary Material, Table S3). A sensitivity
analysis adjusted for subsequent hospitalisations for
sepsis and pneumonia infections revealed that inclusion
of later episodes attenuate the estimates somewhat
(Supplementary Material, Table S4). Another sensitiv-
ity analysis began follow-up from 1987 to allow adjust-
ment for adult-onset diseases diagnosed by this time.
Following adjustment for the Charlson Comorbidity
Index score, as well as the potential confounding fac-
tors in childhood and adolescence used in the main
analysis, the statistically significant results between
serious infections and CVD are only of slightly lower
magnitude than the main analysis (Supplementary
Material, Table S5). In sensitivity analyses with sepsis
and pneumonia infections separated, slightly higher
magnitude associations were found for sepsis (data
not shown). To ensure undiagnosed heart disease at
the time of first severe infection was not confounding
the results, we performed an analysis beginning follow-
up from 2000, when most modern diagnostic tests were
used. The findings are consistent with the main results
(Supplementary Material).
Discussion
In this general population-based cohort study of men
followed from adolescence to late middle age, a first
episode of severe sepsis or pneumonia infection in
adulthood was associated with a notably increased
risk of CVD that persisted for several years after the
infection. The magnitude of association was highest in
the year following infection, but remained at a rela-
tively high magnitude for up to three years and was
not eliminated after five years. The results were similar
for a more homogeneous outcome, CHD, as well as for
stroke. The persistent raised risk could not be explained
by subsequent severe infections.
An association with serious infections and short-
term risk of CVD has been established in previous stu-
dies,12,23 while findings from some studies addressing
long-term effects of infections for CVD risk have been
conflicting.2,4,24 The results of this study are consistent
with a small number of previous studies that have
found delayed associations with CVD risk after severe
infections.14–17 We defined our exposure as two rela-
tively common serious infections that require inpatient
treatment. Sepsis will result in hospital admission, while
only more severe pneumonia requires inpatient care:
previous studies have shown that inpatient-treated
infections are associated with a higher risk of CVD
compared to less severe infections treated in primary
care.8,12 CHD, a subset of CVD diagnoses, and also
stroke were chosen as separate outcomes because we
hypothesised that infection-related influences on ath-
erosclerotic plaques may be relevant to long-term
risks. Unfortunately, due to lack of power, we could
not identify any specific typology of CVD or CHD
during follow-up. Strengths of this study include its
long follow-up from adolescence, when CVD is uncom-
mon and the use of detailed baseline measurements to
address potential confounding with adjustment for
known CVD risks in childhood and adolescence,19 as
well as excluding all men with any CVD prior to follow-
up to reduce the risk of reverse causation. Some previ-
ous studies of infections and CVD risk could not
address potential confounding so comprehensively.14,17
Some chronic diseases in adulthood can increase risk
both of infections and CVD,25 so we conducted a
sensitivity analysis beginning follow-up later, so that
adult-onset diseases could be used to construct a
Charlson Comorbidity Index score that is relevant to
CVD and mortality risk.26 Even though this reduced
follow-up duration and there were fewer CVD out-
comes
(men
with
earlier
CVD
diagnoses
were
excluded), the same pattern of association between
infections and persistent raised CVD risk was observed.
The results from analysis of the later follow-up entry
also indicate that the results are not driven by associ-
ations with earlier-onset CVD which may be aetiologic-
ally different to later-onset disease, such as some types
of congenital or rheumatic heart disease.
The temporal pattern of association between infec-
tions and CVD (initially high and then reducing in
magnitude) is suggestive of a causal association. We
used the first infection and took into account timing
of the infection. As we hypothesised that severe infec-
tion has persistent immunological or metabolic changes
raising CVD risk, we examined first infection, and in a
sensitivity analysis adjusted for the effect of subsequent
infections. We are not aware of other studies that have
examined the role of multiple infectious episodes,14–17
but our results indicate that even a single serious infec-
tion is associated with a persistent risk of CVD particu-
larly in the years immediately following the infection.
The mechanisms by which infections could influence
long-term risk of CVD require further investigation.
Persistent systemic inflammatory activity which could
follow infection is a known risk factor for CVD.27
Bergh et al.
1963
 Although most patients who experience sepsis or pneu-
monia recover, many continue to exhibit high circulat-
ing inflammatory markers after the acute phase of
the infection.28 Inflammation and coagulative pathways
are linked,29 and inflammation in acute infections is
frequently followed by a procoagulant state, which
is characterised by activation of procoagulant pathways
and
inhibition
of
anticoagulant
pathways,30,31
and probably represents one of the most important
mechanisms
underlying
infection-associated
CVD.
Clotting and platelet activation may be one mechan-
ism through which infections such as pneumonia pre-
cipitate heart disease.32,33 Heightened pro-coagulant
activity can persist long after infections resolve, result-
ing in an extended period of several years where a
heightened CVD risk exists,24 and a recent study
found an association between infections in early life
and adult CHD risk.34 While these mechanisms may
arguably be most directly applicable to the atheroscler-
otic processes linked with the CHD subgroup of out-
comes, they could also raise the risk of other CVD
outcomes.
As with virtually all observational studies there are
some potential limitations, despite use of prospectively
recorded data from national registers with a high level
of completeness. The validity of inpatient diagnoses
recorded in the National Patient Register is high35
but, as misclassification exists, this reduces the preci-
sion of our estimates. As sepsis and pneumonia as
defined here required inpatient care, there is likely
to be a high degree of diagnostic precision. However,
as the infecting organism may not be identified there is
likely some heterogeneity that we cannot identify.
Surveillance bias (where one disease is identified
because of the presence of another) is not a great con-
cern in this study, as although CVD may be diagnosed
incidentally or exacerbated during the acute phase of
the infection among inpatients, this source of bias
is highly unlikely to account for the associations seen
in the years following infection. This study only
included men, as conscription was only compulsory
for males in this birth cohort, so our results may not
be identical for women. Our estimates are based on the
first episode of serious infection to reduce the complex-
ity of interpretation: most men in this cohort had few
infections and adjustment for multiple subsequent
severe infections (which might be considered as over-
adjustment) did not explain a large component of the
associations. Despite this, focusing on the first infection
will have produced conservative estimates of associ-
ation. We selected just two infections as they are
relatively common and therefore likely to be recorded
well in the National Patient Register. Even though the
results are similar for both infections, we cannot
be certain if other serious infections would have the
same pattern of persistent association with CVD: this
is an area for future investigation. More severe infec-
tions requiring inpatient treatment were selected as
these are likely to have the most pronounced inflamma-
tory and procoagulant consequences, so we cannot
extend the findings to other infections. Previous studies
on influenza and CVD show only short-term risks with
lower magnitude associations.36 Residual confounding
is
always
a
possibility
in
observational
studies.
However, the temporal pattern of association between
infection and CVD with high magnitude estimates, the
small impact of adjustment for potential confounding
factors from childhood and adolescence, as well as
results from the sensitivity analysis with adjustment
for chronic diseases in adulthood indicated by the
Charlson
Comorbidity
Index
score,
all
suggest
that confounding is unlikely to explain a large compo-
nent
of
the
observed
associations.
Undiagnosed
CVD increasing the likelihood of hospital admission
for symptoms of a severe infection represents a poten-
tial confounding factor. However, this does not seem to
explain our results as they are consistent, even when the
study period was limited to after 2000 when modern
diagnostic techniques would have identified CVD in
patients admitted for a severe infection.
Conclusions
The risk of a first CVD diagnosis can remain persist-
ently raised for several years following a serious infec-
tion. This suggests another reason to protect against
infection and identifies a post-infection window of
increased CVD risk which both healthcare profes-
sionals and patients should be aware of, when add-
itional monitoring or preventative interventions may
be of particular value in reducing disease burden. The
most notably raised CVD risk may be during the first
three years following infection, but a raised risk can
persist beyond this duration.
