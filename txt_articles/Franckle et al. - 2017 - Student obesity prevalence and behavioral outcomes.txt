Objective: To examine changes in prevalence of obesity and target health behaviors (fruit, vegetable,
and beverage consumption; physical activity; screen time; sleep duration) among students from com-
munities that participated in the Massachusetts Childhood Obesity Research Demonstration (MA-CORD)
project compared to controls.
Methods: MA-CORD was implemented in two low-income communities. School-level prevalence of obesity
among students in first, fourth, and seventh grades was calculated for the intervention communities and
nine matched control communities pre and post intervention. Fourth- and seventh-grade students’ self-
reported health behaviors were measured in intervention communities at baseline and post intervention.
Results: Among seventh-graders (the student group with greatest intervention exposure), a statistically
significant decrease in prevalence of obesity from baseline to post intervention in Community 2 (22.68%,
P 5 0.049) and a similar but nonsignificant decrease in Community 1 (22.24%, P 5 0.099) was observed.
Fourth- and seventh-grade students in both communities were more likely to meet behavioral targets
post intervention for sugar-sweetened beverages (both communities: P < 0.0001) and water (Community
1: P < 0.01; Community 2: P 5 0.04) and in Community 2 for screen time (P < 0.01).
Conclusions: This multisector intervention was associated with a modest reduction in obesity prevalence
among seventh-graders in one community compared to controls, along with improvements in behavioral targets.

Introduction
Childhood obesity persists as a pressing public health issue. While
evidence suggests recent progress among 2- to 5-year-olds (1), over-
all prevalence of childhood obesity is historically high and may still
be increasing for older adolescents (2). Moreover, racial/ethnic and
socioeconomic disparities appear to be increasing (3-5). In recent
years, there has been a movement toward multilevel, multisector
approaches for the prevention and control of obesity, with the
Institute of Medicine stating that engagement across levels and set-
tings is critical for reducing disparities in obesity risk (6). While the
evidence base for such interventions is growing (7-11), there is still
a need for empirical evidence for multisector approaches in diverse
communities in the United States.
The Childhood Obesity Research Demonstration (CORD) project is
a multilevel, multisector community intervention that integrated

THE MA-CORD PROJECT
Obesity
 clinical and public health evidence-based approaches to promote
healthy lifestyle behaviors and reduce rates of obesity among under-
served children 2 to 12 years of age (12). Massachusetts was one of
three demonstration grantees, in addition to California and Texas, under
the CORD framework (12). The design and evaluation of the Massachu-
setts CORD (MA-CORD) project has been previously described
(13,14). In short, MA-CORD was implemented in two low-income
communities in Massachusetts (2012–2014) and targeted six community
sectors or settings: schools, health centers, after-school programs, com-
munity, early care and education, and Special Supplemental Nutrition
Program for Women, Infants, and Children. Collectively, the interven-
tion activities were designed to reduce the prevalence of childhood obe-
sity and promote key behavioral targets: replacement of nutrient-poor
foods with fruits and vegetables, decreased consumption of sugar-
sweetened beverages (SSB), increased physical activity (PA), decreased
screen time, and increased sleep duration.
In this study, we examine changes in the prevalence of obesity among
elementary and middle school students in the two intervention commun-
ities compared with nine matched control communities. We also
describe changes in students’ self-reported diet, PA, sleep, and media
behaviors from pre to post intervention for the two intervention com-
munities. These findings add important empirical evidence to the body
of literature concerning multilevel, multisector, community-based inter-
ventions and may inform the design of future obesity prevention efforts.
Methods
Intervention setting
The MA-CORD intervention was implemented in two diverse, low-
income Massachusetts communities from 2012 to 2014; both com-
munities received the intervention. These communities were selected
using a competitive application process, and selection criteria
included income and capacity for obesity prevention (13). For com-
parison with these two intervention communities, nine control com-
munities were selected based on criteria described in the “Selection
of control communities” section below.
Characteristics of the intervention and control communities and stu-
dents are summarized in Table 1. The communities were predomi-
nantly non-Hispanic white (both 68%) with large Hispanic populations
(Community 1: 22%, Community 2: 17%) and had per capita incomes
that were substantially lower (Community 1: $22,620, Community 2:
$21,056) than the state overall ($35,500 in 2012) (15). Approximately
two-thirds of the student body in both intervention communities was
defined as low income (Community 1: 66.5%, Community 2: 67.7%).
Across both intervention communities, each with a single school dis-
trict, there were 28 schools eligible to participate in MA-CORD
(Community 1: three elementary schools, two middle schools, and one
combined elementary/middle school; Community 2: nineteen elemen-
tary schools and three middle schools).
Study procedures were approved by the human subjects committees
of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Harvard T.H.
Chan School of Public Health, Massachusetts General Hospital, and
Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute in June 2012.

MA-CORD Student Obesity and Behavioral Outcomes

 Intervention components in each city’s public elementary and mid-
dle schools included evidence-based health education curricula (Eat
Well and Keep Moving (17) in fourth and fifth grades and Planet
Health (18) in sixth and seventh grades), as well as teacher training
and resources on the curricula. The program established a school
district coordinator for each community and at least one school well-
ness champion in each school to receive training and help ensure
that MA-CORD activities were carried out. PA supplies were also
provided to schools in Community 2, and a student media competi-
tion was held to increase awareness of MA-CORD and promote the
target behaviors (19).
MA-CORD intervention activities in other sectors most likely to affect
the school-aged population include those implemented in health cen-
ters, after-school programs, and the broader community. In short, each
city’s federally qualified community health centers implemented train-
ing, computerized point-of-care decision support tools (20), and multi-
disciplinary weight management programs, in addition to integrating
community health workers into clinic teams and making environmen-
tal changes to support the intervention. Seven after-school programs in
Community 1 and sixteen programs in Community 2 worked with
MA-CORD to implement professional development opportunities for
staff related to healthy eating, PA, and screen time and also imple-
mented the Food and Fun After School curriculum (available at http://
osnap.org/resources/food-and-fun-afterschool/)
to
help
children
develop healthy habits (21,22). Finally, coalitions in each city built
upon existing initiatives to implement community-level policy, sys-
tems, and environmental change strategies and utilized media channels
to reach all children and their families living in the two communities.
Evaluation design
This study utilized two designs: a quasi-experimental design with pre/
post data for the intervention communities and the matched control
communities (for obesity prevalence) and a quasi-experimental design
with pre/post data for only the intervention communities (for behav-
ioral outcomes). As described below, our approach for the obesity
prevalence analysis made use of an extended (4-year) prebaseline
period and then three data collection points after the intervention
began, early in each of the subsequent three school years.
Data collection procedures
Massachusetts public schools are required to measure heights and
weights of all children in grades 1, 4, 7, and 10 on an annual basis
and document prevalence of overweight and obesity by gender and
grade (23). As a result, obesity prevalence data in these grades were
available for the two intervention and nine control communities for
an extended prebaseline period (four school years preceding the
intervention), the intervention period (i.e., the 2012-2013 and 2013-
2014 school years), and post intervention.
For schools receiving the MA-CORD intervention, this procedure
was modified during the 2012-2013 (baseline) and 2014-2015 (post
intervention) school years to also include a written, self-reported stu-
dent survey that measured demographic characteristics (age, gender,
and race/ethnicity) and the five target behaviors. All fourth- and sev-
enth-graders from the intervention communities were invited to
complete this survey at the time of height/weight measurement
(N 5 2,456 students at baseline, N 5 2,506 at follow-up). There is
evidence for moderate validity for these self-reported outcome meas-
ures in students as young as fourth grade (14,24). First-grade stu-
dents did not complete the survey over concerns about their ability
to report information accurately. The school nurse documented first-
grade students’ demographic information using school records.
Thus, in the intervention communities, student height and weight
were measured each year for all students in first, fourth, and seventh

 grades, and student self-reported health behaviors were measured at
baseline and after the intervention for students in fourth and seventh
grades. In the control communities, student obesity prevalence data
were measured each year for students in first, fourth, and seventh
grades; student health behaviors were not assessed due to logistical
constraints. Due to the data collection schedule and the fact that the
curricula were implemented during the 2 years of intervention with
students in fourth through seventh grades only, at the time of final
follow-up, students in seventh grade had the longest exposure to the
intervention and were the only grade (of those measured) to have
received any classroom-based lessons.
To operationalize students’ potential exposure to MA-CORD inter-
vention activities across the sectors, we collected information on the
number of students eligible to receive the MA-CORD intervention,
the percent of eligible teachers who attended trainings (in the school
sector), the number of children ages 6 to 12 years attending each
community’s health center in relation to school enrollment, and pro-
gram enrollment in the after-school sector in relation to school
enrollment, in order to estimate reach of the intervention.
Selection of control communities
Among Massachusetts communities that collected height and weight
data, 66 communities had complete school obesity data for first,
fourth, and seventh grades during the four preintervention years and
two intervention years (i.e., all school years ending in 2009-2014).
These communities were considered eligible for selection as matched
control communities. Nine control communities were selected using
Euclidean distance matching, based on racial/ethnic composition (per-
cent black, percent white, percent Hispanic) and percent low income
in each school district. Average rates of each characteristic across the
preintervention period (school years ending in 2009-2011) were used.
The sum of linear differences across matching variables was
calculated for each eligible control community in relation to each of
the two intervention communities, and eligible control communities
were ranked from smallest to largest distance. All distance calcula-
tions were conducted using SAS PROC DISTANCE, with matching
variables standardized to a mean of 0 and standard deviation (SD) of
1. There was complete overlap in the top nine matches for each inter-
vention community, so those nine districts were selected to serve as
controls for both intervention districts. The inclusion of additional
matching variables (percent female, obesity prevalence, and over-
weight prevalence), in addition to racial/ethnic composition and low-
income percentage, had no appreciable impact on the ranks of control
communities. Validating this matching approach, a regression model
predicting average rates of obesity among the 66 eligible control com-
munities and two intervention communities across the preintervention
period, school racial/ethnic composition, and low-income percentage
explained 72% of the variation in obesity rates (R2 5 0.72).
Primary outcome measures
Outcome measures have been described in detail previously (14);
brief descriptions are as follows.
Prevalence of obesity.
Children’s weight and height were meas-
ured by school nurses and were used to calculate child BMI (kg/m2)
and age and sex-specific BMI percentiles (25). A standard definition
of childhood obesity (�95th BMI percentile for age and sex) was
used (26).
Dietary behaviors.
Children were asked about fruit, vegetable,
SSB (i.e., nondiet sodas and fruit-flavored drinks), 100% juice, and
water consumption on the previous day, with a four-point response
scale (e.g., 0 5 did not eat any vegetables, 1 5 ate vegetables one
time yesterday, 2 5 ate vegetables two times yesterday, 3 5 ate veg-
etables three or more times yesterday) (26,27).
Figure 2 Timing of MA-CORD implementation and school-based measurements. *This study utilized two designs: a
quasi-experimental design with pre/post data for the intervention communities and the matched control communities
(for obesity prevalence) and a quasi-experimental design with pre/post data for only the intervention communities (for
behavioral outcomes).

 PA.
Children were asked about the number of days in the past
week that they participated in at least 30 minutes of moderate-to-
vigorous PA (i.e., “physical activity that made your heart beat fast
or made you breathe hard”) (26,27).
Screen time.
Children’s screen time was assessed using two ques-
tions on time spent watching television/digital video discs and time
spent playing video games and computer games for a typical week-
day and weekend day in the past week. This information was used
to calculate average daily screen time (17,28).
Sleep duration.
Children recalled the times they went to bed and
woke up the next morning on a usual weekday, which were used to
calculate total sleep time (14).
Dichotomous outcome targets were defined in accordance with
MA-CORD behavioral guidelines and national recommendations as
follows: zero occasions drinking SSBs on the previous day, one or
zero occasions of 100% juice, one or more occasions of water, five
or more occasions of fruits and vegetables, less than 2 hours of daily
screen time, 10 or more hours of sleep on a usual day, and at least
30 minutes of PA every day.
Statistical analyses
Our primary analysis examined change in the prevalence of obesity
in the intervention communities compared to change in the matched
controls. Repeated population cross-sections of obesity prevalence
were available for all children in first, fourth, and seventh grades in
the two intervention communities and the nine control communities
at each of seven time points (4 years pre baseline and three data col-
lection points after the intervention began).
We used SAS PROC MIXED to examine change in the prevalence of
obesity in each intervention community relative to the control com-
munities. We used linear mixed models with a random intercepts
model, assuming compound symmetry, and using the repeated func-
tion to account for the nesting of repeated annual grade-specific obe-
sity rates within communities. Our model included terms for the year
of observation, changes in slope following the intervention in the two
intervention communities, indicators for each intervention community,
indicators for grade, and measures of race/ethnicity (percent non-
Hispanic African American, percent Hispanic/Latino, and percent
non-Hispanic white students) and percent low income at the school
level. This last variable was defined as the percent of enrollment who
met any of the following: the student is eligible for free or reduced-
price lunch; the student receives Transitional Aid to Families benefits;
or the student is eligible for Special Supplemental Nutrition Program
benefits. This variable was not available for 2014-2015, so we carried
forward the previous year’s value. Additionally, we stratified models
examining change in obesity prevalence by grade level. As previously
noted, we expected to see the largest effects among seventh-graders
because they had the longest exposure to the main component of the
school intervention (i.e., the health curricula), and they were the only
students of those measured to have received any classroom-based
intervention at the time of final follow-up.
To assess change in the behavioral targets, the prevalence of target
behaviors at baseline and postintervention follow-up was examined.
Eligible subjects for behavioral outcomes analyses had complete
data on gender, age, race/ethnicity, school, dietary outcomes, sleep,
screen time, and PA. After excluding students with implausible val-
ues for sleep (i.e., < 3 hours or > 18 hours) and implausible values
for screen time (i.e., > 3 SD above the mean), our analytic sample
consisted of 1,918 students at baseline and 1,783 students at follow-
up. This comparison was limited to the intervention communities
because survey data were not available from a control community.
Using individual-level data from repeated cross-sections, we used log
binomial regression (with generalized estimating equations to account
for clustering by school) to estimate the risk ratio (RR) of meeting
behavioral targets post intervention compared to baseline. Models were
stratified by community and adjusted for any differences in student gen-
der, grade, and race/ethnicity between pre- and post-intervention periods.
To test for potential heterogeneity of associations by grade, grade-
stratified models were examined as well. All analyses were conducted
using SAS (version 9.3; SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).
Results
Based on the number of students eligible to receive the MA-CORD
intervention and the percent of eligible teachers who attended train-
ings, we estimated that 100% of eligible students in Community 1 and
approximately 70% of eligible students in Community 2 were reached
by the school-sector classroom lessons. In contrast, based on after-
school program enrollment and public school enrollment (grades K-8),
we estimated that 11% of students in Community 1 and 7% of students
in Community 2 were potentially reached by the intervention in the
after-school setting, and based on community health center attendance
and public school enrollment, approximately 8% of students in Com-
munity 1 and 14% of students in Community 2 were reached by the
intervention in the clinical setting.
Change in obesity prevalence
Results from the model examining change in prevalence of obesity
are presented in Table 2. Overall, we did not observe a significant
decrease in the percent of students with obesity from baseline to
post intervention in either community in comparison with controls
(Community 1: 20.77% change per year, 95% confidence interval
[CI] 5 22.06 to 0.52, P 5 0.240; Community 2: 20.17% change per
year, 95% CI 5 21.45 to 1.11, P 5 0.795). However, a statistically
significant decrease in the percent of students with obesity from
baseline to post intervention was observed for seventh grade in
Community 2 (22.68% change per year, 95% CI 5 25.34 to 20.01,
P 5 0.049), and a marginally significant decrease was observed for
seventh grade in Community 1 (22.24% change per year, 95%
CI 5 24.92 to 0.43, P 5 0.099) compared to the control commun-
ities. Results did not change when models were additionally adjusted
for gender, and no significant effect was observed for first and
fourth grades. Additionally, in a secondary analysis examining the
effect of the intervention in both communities combined, compared
to the control communities, we also observed a statistically signifi-
cant decrease for seventh grade (22.46% change per year, 95%
CI 5 24.43 to 20.49, P 5 0.015) but not for first and fourth grades.

 screen time (RR 5 1.24, 95% CI 5 1.09-1.41). There were no signifi-
cant differences observed in either community for fruits and vegeta-
bles, 100% juice, sleep, or PA. There were no meaningful differen-
ces by grade in grade-stratified models.
Discussion
We observed a decline in obesity prevalence among seventh-grade
students in one of the two intervention communities compared to
the control communities. Although the relative change in obesity
prevalence in the other intervention community was not significant,
the effect size was similar for both intervention communities (Com-
munity 1: 22.24% change per year, P 5 0.099; Community 2:
22.68% change per year, P 5 0.049). This effect was limited to
seventh-grade students, which is consistent with how the school-
sector intervention was implemented (16). We sought to reduce the
prevalence of obesity across all of the target ages; however, the
most substantial intervention components in the school sector tar-
geted only some grades (fourth through seventh grades), and evalua-
tion data from repeated cross-sections were only available from first,
fourth, and seventh grades—the grades in which student height and
weight are measured in Massachusetts. Thus, among the students
with postintervention data, only those in seventh grade had received
the classroom-based lessons while in fifth grade (during year 1 of
the intervention) and sixth grade (during year 2 of the intervention).
Intervention exposure for the other grades with measurement data
(first and fourth grades) was limited to intervention components in
after-school programs and community health centers that had
smaller reach, as well as some of the broader community efforts of
MA-CORD. Given the brief duration of intervention, the significant
effect in Community 2 and the marginal effect for Community 1 are
notable changes. Future work should include a clear measure of
exposure across various sectors.
With an approximately 2% to 3% reduction in obesity prevalence
per year, these findings are comparable to results from some other
community-based interventions (7,8,10) and curricula (18) that have
demonstrated modest, statistically significant improvements in stu-
dent relative weight status. In addition, there were observable
improvements in both communities with respect to SSB and water
consumption, as well as improvements in screen time in Community
2, but there were no observable effects with respect to fruits and
vegetables, juice, sleep, or PA.
Overall, there were six suggested lessons from the Eat Well and
Keep Moving (17) curriculum (in both fourth and fifth grades) and
five from Planet Health (18) (in both sixth and seventh grades)
related to four of the five target behaviors. Because none of these
lessons addressed sleep, the lack of effect on sleep duration is per-
haps unsurprising. However, there was a focus on screen time reduc-
tion, and we observed a significant improvement in screen time in
Community 2. There was also a focus on healthier beverages, and
we observed significant improvements in both SSB and water con-
sumption. Details regarding lessons learned from community stake-
holders (29) and additional details of implementation in the school
sector (16) have been previously reported. Results related to clinical
effectiveness (30) and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program
(31) are also published in this issue of Obesity.
This study has several strengths, notably the large and racially/ethni-
cally diverse sample, in addition to the use of matched controls for
the primary obesity prevalence analysis. The largest limitation is the
possibility that temporal trends could differ among communities for
reasons other than the intervention. Though there were overall
reductions in childhood obesity in Massachusetts during the study
period, the use of control communities addresses the potential con-
cern that secular trends explained intervention changes in obesity
prevalence. This comparison was not possible for the behavioral tar-
gets because the student behavioral surveys were only collected in
the two intervention communities.
Conclusion
Improvements in the prevalence of obesity (among seventh-graders
in one community compared to controls) and in selected behavioral
targets were modest but should be considered in the context of the
substantial challenges of implementing a large-scale, multisector in-
tervention in two financially constrained communities over a fairly
short period of time. Future work should continue to consider factors
associated with successful implementation of such community-based
initiatives, as well as the long-term sustained impacts of such
efforts.O
