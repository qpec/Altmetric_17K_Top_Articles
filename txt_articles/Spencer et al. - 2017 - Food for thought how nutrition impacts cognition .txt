Food for thought: how nutrition impacts cognition and
emotion

More than one-third of American adults are obese and statistics are similar worldwide. Caloric intake and diet composition have
large and lasting effects on cognition and emotion, especially during critical periods in development, but the neural mechanisms
for these effects are not well understood. A clear understanding of the cognitive–emotional processes underpinning desires to
over-consume foods can assist more effective prevention and treatments of obesity. This review addresses recent work linking
dietary fat intake and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid dietary imbalance with inflammation in developing, adult, and aged
brains. Thus, early-life diet and exposure to stress can lead to cognitive dysfunction throughout life and there is potential for early
nutritional interventions (e.g., with essential micronutrients) for preventing these deficits. Likewise, acute consumption of a high-fat
diet primes the hippocampus to produce a potentiated neuroinflammatory response to a mild immune challenge, causing memory
deficits. Low dietary intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids can also contribute to depression through its effects on
endocannabinoid and inflammatory pathways in specific brain regions leading to synaptic phagocytosis by microglia in the
hippocampus, contributing to memory loss. However, encouragingly, consumption of fruits and vegetables high in polyphenolics
can prevent and even reverse age-related cognitive deficits by lowering oxidative stress and inflammation. Understanding
relationships between diet, cognition, and emotion is necessary to uncover mechanisms involved in and strategies to prevent or
attenuate comorbid neurological conditions in obese individuals.

INTRODUCTION
Cognitive and emotional dysfunctions are an increasing burden in
our society. The exact factors and underlying mechanisms
precipitating these disorders have not yet been elucidated. Next
to our genetic makeup, the interplay between specific environ-
mental challenges occurring during well-defined developmental
periods seems to play an important role. Interestingly, such brain
dysfunction most often co-occurs with metabolic disorders (e.g.,
obesity) and/or poor dietary habits; obesity and poor diet can lead
to negative health implications including cognitive and mood
dysfunctions, suggesting a strong interaction between these
elements (Fig. 1). Obesity is a global phenomenon, with around
38% of adults and 18% of children and adolescents worldwide
classified as either overweight or obese.1 Even in the absence of
obesity, poor diet is commonplace,2 with, for instance, many
eating foods that are highly processed and lacking in important
polyphenols and anti-oxidants or that contain well-below the
recommended levels of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
(PUFA). In this review, we will discuss the extent of, and
mechanisms for, diet’s influence on mood and cognition during
different stages of life, with a focus on microglial activation,
glucocorticoids and endocannabinoids (eCBs).
PERINATAL DIET DISRUPTS COGNITIVE FUNCTION LONG-
TERM, A ROLE FOR MICROGLIA
Poor diet in utero and during early postnatal life can cause lasting
changes in many aspects of metabolic and central functions,
including impairments in cognition and accelerated brain aging,3
but see.4 Maternal gestational diabetes and even a junk food diet
in the non-diabetic can lead to metabolic complications, including
diabetes and obesity in the offspring.5,6 It can also cause changes
in reward processing in the offspring brain such that they grow to
prefer foods high in fat and sucrose.7,8 Similarly, early introduction
of solid food in children and high childhood consumption of fatty
foods and sweetened drinks can accelerate weight gain and lead
to metabolic complications long-term that may be associated with
poorer executive function.9 On the other hand, some dietary
supplements can positively influence cognition, as is seen with
supplementation of baby formula with long chain omega-3 PUFA
improving cognition in babies.10 In these randomized control trials
(RCTs), an omega-3 PUFA-enriched formula beginning shortly after
birth, or 6 weeks’ breast feeding, significantly improved perfor-
mance of 9-month old babies on a problem solving task (a two-
step task to retrieve a rattle, known to correlate with performance
on IQ tasks).

 From animal models, it is clear that the effects of diet in early
life are far-reaching. Even obesity in rat sires (that play no part in
rearing the offspring) leads to pancreatic beta cell dysfunction in
female offspring, which can be passed on to the next genera-
tion.11 Obesity and high-fat diet feeding in rat and mouse dams
during pregnancy and lactation leads to impairments in several
tests of mood, including those modeling depressive and anxious
behaviors, as well as negatively impacting cognition.12 Diet in the
post-partum to weaning period can impact similar behaviors.13
Additional to the impact of a prenatal diet, over-consumption of
the mother’s milk during the first 3 weeks of a rat’s life leads to
lasting obesity in males and females.14 This neonatal overfeeding
also disrupts cognitive function. For example, neonatally overfed
rats perform poorly in the novel object recognition test and in the
delayed spatial win-shift radial arm maze, as adults, compared
with control rats.15 These findings are interesting to compare with
the effects of poor diet in adults where a longer-term high-fat diet
(around 20 weeks in the rat)16–18 and / or high-fat diet in
conjunction with a pre-diabetic phenotype19 is necessary to
induce cognitive dysfunction. While there are no differences in
post-learning synaptogenesis (synaptophysin) or apoptosis (cas-
pase-3) to explain the effects seen in the neonatally overfed, these
rats do have an impaired microglial response to the learning
task.15
Microglia are one of the major immune cell populations in the
brain. In development, they are essential for synaptic pruning,
while in a mature animal their major role is in mounting a pro-
inflammatory immune response and phagocytosing pathogens
and injured brain cells.20 Hyper-activated microglia can lead to
cognitive dysfunction through excess pro-inflammatory cytokine
production causing impaired long-term potentiation-induction,
reduced production of plasticity-related molecules including
brain-derived neurotrophic factor and insulin-like growth factor-1,
Fig. 1
Schematic depiction of how nutrition influences cognition and emotion. Overeating, obesity, acute high-fat diet consumption, poor
early-life diet or early life adversity can produce an inflammatory response in peripheral immune cells and centrally as well as having impact
upon the blood–brain interface and circulating factors that regulate satiety. Peripheral pro-inflammatory molecules (cytokines, chemokines,
danger signals, fatty acids) can signal the immune cells of the brain (most likely microglia) via blood-borne, humoral, and/or lymphatic routes.
These signals can either sensitize or activate microglia leading to de novo production of pro-inflammatory molecules such as interleukin-
1beta (IL1β), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) within brain structures that are known to mediate cognition (hippocampus) and
emotion (hypothalamus, amygdala, prefrontal cortex and others). Amplified inflammation in these regions impairs proper functioning leading
to memory impairments and/or depressive-like behaviors. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), polyphenolics, and a positive (+ve) early life
environment (appropriate nutrition and absence of significant stress or adversity) can prevent these negative outcomes by regulating
peripheral and central immune cell activity. Images are adapted from Servier Medical Art, which is licensed under a Creative Commons

However,
an
appropriate
microglial response may also be essential for effective learning.
Neonatally overfed rats have more microglia in the CA1 region
of the hippocampus at postnatal day 14, i.e., while they still have
access to excess maternal milk and are undergoing accelerated
weight gain. These microglia also have larger soma and retracted
processes, indicative of a more activated phenotype. By the time
these rats reach adulthood, there persists an increase in the area
immunolabelled with microglial marker Iba1 in the dentate gyrus.
In the neonatally overfed, the microglial response to a learning
task is less robust than in controls. This effect is associated with a
suppression of cell proliferation in control animals relative to the
neonatally overfed, potentially to preserve existing neuronal
networks and minimize novel inputs while learning takes place.21
Interestingly, global inducible microglial and monocyte depletion
can lead to improved performance in the Barnes maze,22
suggesting withdrawal of microglial activity at specific learning
phases is important
for learning.
These
findings implicate
microglia in the long-term effects of early life overfeeding on
cognition suggesting normal microglia must be able to robustly
respond to learning tasks and neonatal overfeeding impairs their
ability to do so.
Neuroinflammatory processes, including the role of microglia,
can clearly be impacted by neonatal diet and represent at least
one contributing mechanism for how cognitive function is
affected. Neuroinflammation and microglia can also be impacted
by other early life events and play a significant role in how stress
during development alters long-term physiology.
EARLY-LIFE STRESS (ES) PROGRAMS VULNERABILITY TO
COGNITIVE DISORDERS
ES alters brain structure and function life-long, leading to
increased vulnerability to develop emotional and cognitive
disorders as is evident from several preclinical and clinical
studies.23–25 The exact underlying mechanisms for such program-
ming remain elusive. There is extensive seminal work indicating a
key role for sensory stimuli from the mother and neuroendocrine
factors (e.g., stress hormones) in this programming,26,27 however it
has been recently suggested that these factors might act
synergistically with metabolic and nutritional elements.28 In fact,
ES is associated with increased vulnerability to develop metabolic
disorders such as obesity, which mostly co-occur with cognitive
deficits,29,30 and both ES and an adverse early nutritional
environment lead to strikingly similar cognitive impairments later
in life,28,31 suggesting that metabolic factors and nutritional
elements might mediate some of the ES effects on brain structure
and function.
The brain has a very high demand for nutrients in this early
period and nutritional imbalances affect normal neurodevelop-
ment resulting in lasting cognitive deficits.32 Understanding the
role of metabolic factors and specific nutrients in this context is
key to develop effective peripheral (e.g., nutritional) intervention
strategies. A mouse model of the chronic ES of limited nesting and
bedding material during the first postnatal week has been shown
to lead to aberrant maternal care, which leads to cognitive decline
in the ES offspring.24,33,34
The hippocampus, a brain region key for cognitive functions, is
permanently altered in its structure and function in these ES-
exposed offspring. The hippocampus is in fact particularly
sensitive
to
the
early-life
environment
as
it
continues
its
development into the postnatal period.35 Adult neurogenesis
(AN) is a unique form of plasticity, which takes place in the
hippocampus, consisting of the proliferation of neuronal progeni-
tor cells that differentiate and mature into fully functional neurons
that
subsequently
integrate
into
the
existing
hippocampal
circuitry. These newly formed neurons are involved in various
aspects of hippocampus-dependent learning and memory.36 AN is
affected persistently by ES24,37 and, more precisely, while ES
exposure initially increases neurogenesis (i.e., proliferation and
differentiation of newborn cells) at postnatal day 9, at later time
points (postnatal day 150), the survival of the newly born cells is
reduced.24 In addition, ES affects the neuroinflammatory profile in
a lasting manner, with, for example, increased CD68 (phagocytic
microglia expression) in adulthood.38
Importantly, ES persistently affects peripheral adipose tissue
metabolism as well. White adipose mass (WAT), plasma leptin (the
adipokine released from the WAT) and leptin mRNA expression in
WAT are persistently reduced in ES-exposed offspring.39 In
addition, exposure of ES mice to an unhealthy western style diet,
leads to a higher increase in adiposity in these mice when
compared to controls. These findings suggest that ES exposure
leads to metabolic dysregulation and a greater vulnerability to
develop
obesity
in
a
moderately
obesogenic
environment.
Whether these metabolic alterations contribute to the ES-
induced cognitive deficits warrants further investigation.39
In addition to peripheral metabolism, ES-induced alterations in
the nutritional composition of the dam’s milk, and/or nutrient
intake/absorption by the pup25,28,40 could have lasting conse-
quences for brain structure and function. Indeed, the essential
micronutrient, methionine, a critical component of the one-carbon
(1-C) metabolism that is required for methylation, and for
synthesis
of
proteins,
phospholipids
and
neurotransmitters,
is reduced after ES exposure in plasma and hippocampus of
postnatal day 9 offspring. Importantly, a short supplementation of
the maternal diet only during ES exposure with essential 1-C
metabolism-associated micronutrients not only restores methio-
nine levels peripherally as well as centrally, but rescues (some of)
the effects of ES on hippocampal cognitive measures in adulthood
and prevents the ES-induced hypothalamic-pituitary–adrenal axis
hyperactivity at postnatal day 9.25
These studies highlight the importance of studying metabolic
factors and nutrients in the ES-induced effects on the brain. In the
near future, it will be key to further understand the exact
mechanisms mediating the effects of nutrients and metabolic
factors and the windows of opportunity for interventions on brain
function, as this will open entirely new avenues for targeted
nutrition for vulnerable populations. However, while the early life
period is a window of particular vulnerability to the programming
effects of diet and other environmental influences, diet at other
phases of life is also important in dictating mood and cognition.
ADULT CONSUMPTION OF A HIGH-FAT DIET: A
VULNERABILITY FACTOR FOR HIPPOCAMPAL-DEPENDENT
MEMORY
Adults in developed countries are consuming diets higher in
saturated fats and/or refined sugars than ever before. Indeed,
recent reports show that approximately 12% of American adults’
daily energy intake comes from saturated fats and 13% from
added sugars,41 significantly more than what is recommended
(5–10%) by the US Department of Agriculture and the Department
of Health and Human Services. Not surprisingly, these dietary
habits have contributed to the increasing prevalence of obesity
among adults, which is currently approximately 37% in the US, a
sharp rise from the 13% prevalence rate of 1960.42
These statistics are alarming because aside from its well-known
provocation of cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and
type 2 diabetes, obesity has now also been associated with mild
cognitive impairments and dementia. There is growing evidence
that neuroinflammation may underlie obesity-induced cognitive
deficits.9 Recently, studies have demonstrated that short-term
consumption (1–7 days) of an unhealthy diet (e.g., high saturated
fat and/or high sugar) triggers neuroinflammatory processes,
suggesting that obesity per se may not be necessary to cause
cognitive
disruptions.43,44

 hypothalamus has received the vast majority of the attention with
regard to obesity-induced neuroinflammatory responses and
functional declines,45 perhaps due to its close proximity to the
third ventricle, circumventricular organs, and mediobasal emi-
nence, where inflammatory signals from the periphery have easier
entry into the brain. Indeed, long chain saturated fatty acids have
been shown to directly pass into the hypothalamus producing an
inflammatory
response there through activation of toll-like
receptor 4 signaling.46,47 This active passage of saturated fatty
acids, however, has not been observed in the hippocampus, a key
brain region that mediates learning and memory.46 Nonetheless,
high-fat diet consumption has been demonstrated to impair
hippocampus-dependent
memory
function
in
humans
and
rodents. For example, compared to rodents that consumed a
control diet, those that consumed a high-fat and/or high-sugar
diet exhibited robust impairments in various types of memory
(e.g., spatial, contextual), as indicated by weaker performances in
the Y-maze,48 radial arm maze,15 novel object recognition task,15
novel place recognition task,44,49 Morris water maze,50 and
contextual
fear
conditioning.18,51
Also,
adult
humans
who
consumed a high-fat diet for 5 days exhibited significantly
reduced focused attention and reduced retrieval speed of
information from working and episodic memory, compared with
those who consumed a standard diet.52
Many of these studies, and others, have shown that high-fat
diet-induced cognitive deteriorations are accompanied by ele-
vated neuroinflammatory markers or responses in the hippocam-
pus.15,18,44,48–51,53 However, the mechanisms by which these
neuroinflammatory processes signal and/or affect the hippocam-
pus are not entirely clear. There is growing evidence that high-fat
diets may compromise the hippocampus by sensitizing the
immune cells (most likely microglia) of this brain structure, thus
priming the inflammatory response to subsequent challenging
stimuli.18,50,51 For example, one study demonstrated that adult rats
that had eaten a high-fat diet for 5 months exhibited a sensitized
hippocampus such that when they received a relatively mild
stressor (a single, 2 s, 1.5 mA footshock) following a learning
session the neuroinflammatory response in the hippocampus was
potentiated compared to the response of rats that had eaten the
regular chow, and this response led to deficits in long-term
contextual memory.18 Another study showed that just 3 days of
consuming
a
high-fat
diet
was
sufficient
to
sensitize
the
hippocampus of adult rats. Here, a low-dose peripheral immune
challenge (with lipopolysaccharide; LPS) produced an exaggerated
neuroinflammatory response in the hippocampus of these rats
compared to those that consumed the regular chow, and also led
to contextual memory deficits.51
Significantly elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines in the hippo-
campus have been shown to deteriorate various mechanisms that
enable synaptic plasticity (such as long-term potentiation), and
thus long-term memory.54 Sobesky et al.51 demonstrated that
high-fat diet consumption primes the cells of the hippocampus by
elevating the glucocorticoid steroid hormone corticosterone in
this region. Despite its classic role as an immunosuppressant,
there is increasing evidence demonstrating that corticosterone
can prime hippocampal microglia and potentiate the inflamma-
tory response to a subsequent challenge.55–57 For example, Frank
et al.55 elegantly showed that when corticosterone was elevated
prior to a peripheral immune challenge (LPS), the resulting
inflammatory response in the hippocampus was potentiated. In
contrast, when corticosterone was elevated after the immune
challenge, the neuroinflammatory response was suppressed.
These findings suggest that the temporal relationship between
the corticosterone increase and the immune challenge dictates
whether a pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory response will
result.55 Sobesky et al.51 found that rats that consumed the high-
fat diet for 3 days exhibited significantly increased levels of
corticosterone in their hippocampus compared to rats that
consumed the regular chow or a novel macronutrient-matched
control diet. This high-fat diet-induced corticosterone rise was
accompanied by increases in the endogenous danger-associated
molecular pattern high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), the
interleukin (IL)-1 inflammasome-associated protein NLRP3, and
the microglial activation marker cd11b. high-fat diet alone did not,
however, elevate the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β unless rats
were subsequently challenged with a low-dose of LPS. Thus, LPS
challenge potentiated the pro-inflammatory response in the
hippocampus of high-fat diet-fed rats compared to the response
to LPS in chow-fed rats. To evaluate the role of corticosterone
signaling in neuroinflammatory priming caused by consumption
of high-fat diet, Sobesky et al.51 administered the glucocorticoid
receptor antagonist, mifepristone, prior to high-fat diet consump-
tion. This resulted in a normalized hippocampal IL-1β response to
low-dose LPS. Furthermore, mifepristone significantly reduced the
high-fat diet + LPS-induced expression of HMGB1, IκBα, and
NLRP3. Moreover, mifepristone treatment effectively prevented
contextual memory deficits caused by high-fat diet consumption
combined with LPS challenge. These data provide strong evidence
for the
idea
that
(a) high-fat
diet
consumption
increases
corticosterone within the hippocampus, and (b) this corticoster-
one is a key mediator in sensitizing microglia or other immune
cells of the hippocampus; (c) sensitized microglia produce a
potentiated neuroinflammatory response to subsequent immune
or stressful challenges, thus producing cognitive deficits. Notably,
though, while high-fat diet per se can have significant detrimental
impact on cognitive processes, specific dietary components may
be able to reverse these effects, omega-3 PUFA are one such
potentially beneficial component.
DIETARY OMEGA-3 PUFA REGULATE NEUROINFLAMMATION
AND ECBS: ROLE IN MOOD AND COGNITIVE DISORDERS
Since their discovery in the early 20th century, considerable
attention has been paid to the roles of PUFA in brain functions.
Omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA are essential fatty acids, meaning
that they have to be provided by the diet. Western diet contains
excessive amounts of omega-6 PUFA as compared to omega-3
leading to an unbalanced ratio between these two fatty acids with
cardiovascular and brain health consequences. Essential omega-3
and omega-6 fatty acids are found in green vegetables, seeds and
nuts although coming from different sources with linolenic acid
(LA, 18:2 omega-6) found in most plants, coconut and palm and α-
linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3 omega-3) in green leafy vegetables, flax
and walnuts. Once consumed, LA and ALA are metabolized into
arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4 omega-6) and docosahexaenoic acid
(DHA, 22:6 omega-3), respectively.
AA and DHA are the main omega-6 and omega-3 long chain
PUFA found in the brain. Both long chain PUFA have pivotal roles
in brain physiology as they regulate fundamental neurobiological
processes, in particular the ones involved in cognition and
mood.58,59 AA and DHA are esterified to the phospholipid of
neuronal and glial cell membranes with a total brain phospholipid
proportion of around 10% for AA and 20% for DHA. Due to the
limited capacity of the brain to synthesize long chain PUFA,
preformed DHA can be provided by dietary supply of oily fishes.
Hence, increased consumption of DHA-rich products results in a
partial replacement of AA by DHA in brain cell membranes.60
Conversely, a lower omega-3 PUFA intake leads to lower brain
levels of DHA with increased AA levels. Higher AA and DHA are
reported in women as compared to men, suggesting a gender
difference in PUFA levels.61 These differences could be linked to
sex hormones as they differentially influence PUFA metabolism
with
estrogen
stimulating,
and
testosterone
inhibiting,
the
conversion of both omega-3 and omega-6 precursors into their
respective long chain metabolites. However, whether these
differences in PUFA have a role in specific brain diseases with a

 gender component has been poorly questioned and requires
further investigation.
After its direct consumption and/or metabolization in the liver,
DHA is increased in the blood and is likely to freely enter into the
brain as non-esterified fatty acid.58 More recently, Mfsd2a (major
facilitator superfamily domain-containing protein 2a), which is
expressed by brain endothelial cells and adiponectin receptor 1 in
the retina, has been revealed to be important to DHA uptake and
retention.62
Abnormal omega-3 PUFA levels have been extensively described
in both the peripheral tissues and in the brain of patients with
mood disorders or cognitive decline, leading to a large number of
RCTs aiming at evaluating the effectiveness of long chain omega-3
PUFA dietary supplementation on mood and cognitive disor-
ders.58,63 Overall, the results are discordant, due to the hetero-
geneity of methods used to evaluate the depressive and/or
cognitive symptoms, the form, dose and duration of the omega-3
PUFA supplementation, the lack of evaluation of nutritional intake
and metabolism of PUFA prior to starting the supplementation, or
the lack of evaluation of genotype-associated risk factors.64
However, despite the discrepancies in the results, it is important
to note that several RCTs performed in patients with depressive
disorders revealed an additional effect of long chain omega-3
PUFA supplementation to antidepressant treatments.65 Of note, a
recent study identifies that depressive patients presenting a high
level of inflammatory markers are more responsive to long chain
omega-3 PUFA supplementation.66 This observation is highly
relevant as these PUFA are potent regulators of inflammation58
and inflammation is a crucial component of mood disorders.
Concerning cognitive decline, despite poor positive results of PUFA
dietary supplementation in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients, RCTs
using DHA supplementation in subjects carrying the apolipopro-
tein E ε4 (APOE4) allele, a risk factor for AD, reveal an improvement
of pre-dementia.64 Overall, discrepancies in clinical studies strongly
support the need for preclinical studies aimed at depicting the
mechanisms of omega-3 PUFA on brain dysfunctions, which
should help to better target populations at risk of cognitive and
mood disorders. In addition, the consideration of omega-3 PUFA
levels in food to cover the physiological requirement of these PUFA
for an optimal brain function is a challenge for the food industry.
Through direct or indirect effects, DHA and AA modulate
neurotransmission and neuroinflammation, which are key pro-
cesses in cognition and mood.58,59 Unesterified long chain PUFA
are released from cell membranes upon the activation of
phospholipase A2 (PLA2) to exert their effects.67 Once released,
AA and DHA are metabolized into bioactive mediators through
cyclooxygenase
(COX),
lipoxygenases
(LOX)
and
cytochrome
P450.68 The conversion of AA into several prostanoids, including
prostaglandins (PG), leukotrienes (LT), thromboxanes (TX) and
lipoxins (LX), is crucial in the progression of inflammation, including
in the brain.58 DHA is also metabolized through the COX/LOX
pathways to generate metabolites with anti-inflammatory and pro-
resolutive properties.68 In the brain, LOX-derived specialized
proresolving mediators (SPMs), neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1), resolvin
D5 (RvD5), and maresin 1 (MaR1) are detected.68,69 Some of these
SPMs potently modulate neuroinflammation in vivo and in vitro,
through their direct effect on microglia.70,71 DHA and SPMs are
impaired at the periphery and in the brains of AD patients.72,73
Interestingly, decreased DHA distribution in AD patient brains
correlates with synaptic loss rather than amyloid beta (Aβ)
deposition.74 In addition, DHA or SPMs promote phagocytosis of
Aβ42 by microglia75 and modulate microglia number and activation
in vivo.76 Whether SPMs play a role in the protective activity of long
chain omega-3 PUFA in mood and cognitive disorders associated to
neuroinflammation remains to be established.
eCBs are other key PUFA-derived lipid mediators in the brain.
The main brain AA-derived eCBs are the fatty acid ethanolamides
anandamide (AEA)
and
2-arachidonoylglycerol
(2-AG),
while
docosahexaenoylethanolamide (DHEA or synaptamide) is an
eCB-like derived from DHA.77 ECBs half-life in the brain is
regulated by specific catabolizing enzymes fatty acid amide
hydrolase for AEA and DHEA and monoacylglycerol lipase for 2-
AG. Regarding neuroinflammatory processes, AA-derived eCBs are
oxidized into bioactive PG by COX and LOX, which promote
inflammation.78 AEA and 2-AG bind to at least two cannabinoid
receptors, type 1 (CB1) and type 2 (CB2), which are Gi/o protein-
coupled with numerous signaling pathways in the brain.79,80 DHEA
has a lower binding affinity for CB1 and CB2 receptors as
compared to AEA and 2-AG and rather bind GPR receptors, in
particular GPR110 in the brain. The dietary omega-3/omega-6
PUFA ratio directly influences the proportion of ethanolamides
derived
from
AA
and
DHA.81
The
modulation
of
eCB
is
accompanied by the impairment of neuronal CB1R activity and
synaptic activity in several brain structures.82,83 2-AG and AEA
regulate synaptic function by suppressing excitatory and inhibi-
tory synapse neurotransmitter release by acting as retrograde
messengers at presynaptic CB1.84 The importance of brain eCB
signaling in the understanding of how altered dietary intake of
PUFA correlates with a range of neurological disorders is of high
interest.81 However, other dietary factors may also contribute to
improved cognition
and
prevention
of cognitive
disorders.
Polyphenolic-rich foods are a further example that have been
shown to have benefit, particularly in the context of aging.
DIETARY INTERVENTIONS WITH POLYPHENOLIC-RICH FOODS
CAN IMPROVE NEURONAL AND BEHAVIOR DEFICITS
ASSOCIATED WITH AGING
It is estimated that approximately 20% of the US total population
will be older than 65 by the year 2050, which is almost double
what it is today.85 Additionally, the US is faced with an increasingly
overweight/obese population that is at heightened risk for
metabolic disorders, resulting in diabetes and cardiovascular
disease, and concomitant behavioral impairment. Aging and
metabolic dysregulation are both associated with numerous
cognitive and motor deficits on tasks that require fine motor
control, balance, short-term and long-term memory, or executive
function. Studies in both humans and animal models have
demonstrated that oxidative stress and inflammation, as well as
impaired insulin resistance, are common features in cardio-
metabolic and vascular disease, obesity, and age-related declines
in cognitive and motor function.86 Neuroinflammation occurs
locally in the brain; however, peripheral inflammatory cells and
circulating inflammatory mediators (e.g., cytokines) can also
infiltrate the brain, and this occurs more readily as we age.87
Therefore, strategies must be found to reduce oxidative and
inflammatory vulnerability to age-related changes and reverse
deficits in motor and cognitive function.
Targeting peripheral inflammation and insulin signaling could
reduce insulin resistance and infiltration of inflammatory media-
tors into the brain and, as a result, reduce the incidence of a
variety of age-related deficits. Studies have shown that plants,
particularly colorful fruit or vegetable-bearing plants, contain
polyphenolic compounds that have potent antioxidant and anti-
inflammatory activities,88 and increased fruit and vegetable intake
has been associated with reduced fasting insulin levels.89 Evidence
is accumulating that consumption of these polyphenol-rich foods,
particularly berry fruit, may be a strategy to forestall or even
reverse age-related neuronal deficits resulting from neuroinflam-
mation.90 Recently this evidence has been extended to double-
blind, placebo-controlled, randomized human intervention studies
that have demonstrated that the consumption of flavonoid/
polyphenols is associated with benefits to cognitive function.91
Preclinical studies have led to the hypothesis that the key to
reducing the incidence of age-related deficits in behavior is to
alter the neuronal environment with polyphenolic-rich foods like

 berry fruit, such that neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, and
the vulnerability to them, would be reduced. In early studies with
animal models, crude blueberry (BB) or strawberry extracts
significantly attenuated92 and reversed93 age-related motor and
cognitive deficits in senescent rodents. BB supplementation also
protected 9 month old C57Bl/6 mice against the damaging effects
of consuming a high-fat diet.94 Novel object recognition memory
was impaired by the high-fat diet, but blueberry supplementation
prevented recognition memory deficits in a time-dependent
manner. Spatial memory, as measured by the Morris water maze,
was also improved after 5 months on the diets.94 Subsequent
research suggested that berry fruit polyphenols may possess a
multiplicity of actions in addition to their anti-inflammatory and
antioxidant activities.90 Additionally, the anthocyanins contained
in blueberries have been shown to enter the brain, and their
concentrations were correlated with cognitive performance.95
Epidemiological
studies
that
have
focused
on
fruit
and
vegetable intake and cognitive function have also largely found
that adequate consumption can prevent cognitive decline, while
low intake is associated with increased cognitive decline.85
Specifically, increased intake of blueberries and strawberries, as
well as increased intakes of anthocyanidins and total flavanoids,
were associated with slowing the rate of cognitive decline by up
to 2.5 years.96
The ability of berry fruit to protect against age-related cognitive
decline has also been examined in a growing number of double-
blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, human intervention stu-
dies. Thus, blueberry juice significantly improved word list recall
and paired associate learning in older men and women with age-
related memory decline that consumed it, relative to baseline,
with paired associate learning also significantly improved relative
to placebo controls.97 A recent study98 that measured similar
cognitive tasks as those in the rodent studies, showed that freeze-
dried blueberries (24 g/day, equivalent to one cup of fresh
blueberries) for 90 days improved two measures of executive
function in older adults (ages 60–75). Participants in the blueberry
group showed significantly fewer repetition errors in the California
Verbal Learning test as well as reduced switch cost on a task-
switching test across study visits, relative to controls who
consumed placebo powder. However, no improvement in gait
or balance was observed following blueberry intake.98 Finally, 12
weeks of blueberry concentrate supplementation improved brain
perfusion, task-related activation, and cognitive function (i.e.,
working memory) in healthy older adults who consumed 30 mL
blueberry concentrate providing 387 mg anthocyanidins.99 These
studies suggest that berry fruit might be an effective strategy to
prevent, delay, or reverse cognitive dysfunction during aging.
Cognitive aging does not occur simultaneously across cognitive
domains, with various domains peaking in early adulthood before
reaching a plateau or declining. Therefore, interventions early in
life may yield health benefits that are only measureable in later
life. Blueberries have been shown to have positive cognitive
benefits in two acute, cross-over designed studies in school-aged
children (ages 7–10). The first study100 showed that consumption
of a flavonoid-rich blueberry (200 g) drink led to significantly
better delayed word-list recall, compared to a matched vehicle
group, on the Rey auditory-verbal learning test, suggesting more
effective coding of memory items. However, there was no benefit
of blueberry intervention on measures of attention, response
inhibition, or visuospatial memory, and a negative impact on
proactive interference.100 The second study100 by the same group
examined cognition at baseline, and then 1.15, 3, and 6 h after
consuming placebo (vehicle) or blueberry drinks containing 15 or
30 g freeze-dried wild blueberry (WBB) powder. Consumption of
WBB powder improved recall at 1.15 h, improved delayed word
recognition, which was sustained at each time point measured,
and improved accuracy on a challenging interference task at 3 h.
The best cognitive performance was seen after the 30 g dose, and
particularly on those tasks with a higher cognitive demand.100
As humans age, their ability to defend against the effects of
oxidative stress and inflammation weakens, putting elderly people
at increased risk for neuronal disease and degradation. Neuro-
protective foods, such as berries and other dark-colored fruits,
represent one way to protect aging brains against this damage by
reducing inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain, thereby
protecting against cognitive declines in aged populations.
CONCLUSION
This review has highlighted the latest advances in how foods and
patterns of consumption at different times of development affect
the brain, and the behavioral manifestations that may result from
these effects. For example, early life overfeeding can permanently
sensitize the brain’s neuroinflammatory response to challenging
stimuli resulting in cognitive and immune dysfunctions through-
out life. ES alters brain function, via metabolic and nutritional
factors, to increase vulnerability to develop emotional and
cognitive disorders. Long-term and short-term consumption of
high saturated fatty foods during adulthood produces a sensitized
inflammatory
phenotype,
via
a
glucocorticoid
rise,
in
the
hippocampus, leading to learning and memory vulnerabilities.
Imbalance
of
omega-3
and
omega-6
PUFA
contribute
to
neurodevelopmental disorders by altering microglial activation
resulting in abnormal formation of neuronal networks and activity.
Finally, consumption of fruits and vegetables high in polyphe-
nolics can prevent and reverse age-related cognitive deficits by
lowering oxidative stress and inflammation. Collectively these data
show that attention to dietary composition is important for lasting
impact beyond the metabolic and highlight the promising
likelihood that we may improve our cognition throughout life
and into the aging period with simple dietary interventions. These
data highlight the need for food industries and science, alike, to
focus on research and development of nutritional strategies that
are most appropriate to support our cognitive and emotional
health; foods that are high in omega-3 PUFA and polyphenolics
may be a promising place to start.
