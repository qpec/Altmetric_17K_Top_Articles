Introduction
A defining feature of sepsis is a profound apoptosis-induced depletion of lymphocytes (1–4). Postmortem 
studies of patients who died of sepsis demonstrate extensive loss of lymphocytes in spleens, intestines, and 
other organs (1, 4). The tissue lymphocyte depletion occurring during sepsis is accompanied by a decrease 
BACKGROUND. A defining pathophysiologic feature of sepsis is profound apoptosis-induced death 
and depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Interleukin-7 (IL-7) is an antiapoptotic common γ-chain 
cytokine that is essential for lymphocyte proliferation and survival. Clinical trials of IL-7 in over 390 
oncologic and lymphopenic patients showed that IL-7 was safe, invariably increased CD4+ and CD8+ 
lymphocyte counts, and improved immunity.
METHODS. We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 
recombinant human IL-7 (CYT107) in patients with septic shock and severe lymphopenia. Twenty-
seven patients at academic sites in France and the United States received CYT107 or placebo for 
4 weeks. Primary aims were to determine the safety of CYT107 in sepsis and its ability to reverse 
lymphopenia.
RESULTS. CYT107 was well tolerated without evidence of inducing cytokine storm or worsening 
inflammation or organ dysfunction. CYT107 caused a 3- to 4-fold increase in absolute lymphocyte 
counts and in circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that persisted for weeks after drug administration. 
CYT107 also increased T cell proliferation and activation.
CONCLUSIONS. This is the first trial of an immunoadjuvant therapy targeting defects in adaptive 
immunity in patients with sepsis. CYT107 reversed the marked loss of CD4+ and CD8+ immune 
effector cells, a hallmark of sepsis and a likely key mechanism in its morbidity and mortality. CYT107 
represents a potential new way forward in the treatment of patients with sepsis by restoring adaptive 
immunity. Such immune-based therapy should be broadly protective against diverse pathogens 
including multidrug resistant bacteria that preferentially target patients with impaired immunity.

in the absolute number of circulating lymphocytes, i.e., lympho-
penia (5–8). This lymphopenia that is present in sepsis consists of 
the loss of many different classes of lymphocytes including CD4+ 
and CD8+ T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells (1, 9). CD4+ T 
cell counts in patients with sepsis are often as low as that occur-
ring in patients with life-threatening AIDS (10). Lymphocytes are 
essential for an effective host defense against invading pathogens 
(11). Studies in patients who have undergone bone marrow or 
solid organ transplantation show a direct correlation between low 
CD4+ cell counts and the incidence of new onset opportunistic 
infections and death (12, 13). Similarly, numerous studies have 
shown that septic patients with more severe and persistent lym-
phopenia have a higher mortality compared with septic patients 
who are either not lymphopenic or who have a lesser degree of 
lymphopenia (5–8).
A key question is whether the lymphocyte depletion in sepsis 
is merely an epiphenomenon or whether it plays a central role 
in lethality in sepsis. Several mechanistic studies have addressed 
this critical issue. Studies by multiple independent laboratories 
showed that mice whose lymphocytes were resistant to sepsis-
induced apoptosis because of either overexpression of the anti-
apoptotic protein Bcl-2 or deletion of the proapoptotic protein 
Bim have improved survival in sepsis (14–19). Furthermore, studies also demonstrate that adoptive transfer 
of lymphocytes that are resistant to sepsis-induced apoptosis, but not adoptive transfer of normal apopto-
sis-susceptible lymphocytes, improves sepsis survival (15). Collectively, these animal studies together with 
patient studies showing a close correlation between the degree of lymphopenia and survival strongly suggest 
that the extensive lymphocyte depletion is fundamental to the pathophysiology of sepsis (20, 21).
Interleukin-7 (IL-7) is a potent Bcl-2–inducing, antiapoptotic, common γ-chain cytokine that is required 
for lymphocyte survival and expansion (22–24). In addition to its antiapoptotic properties, IL-7 induces 
robust proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Given its ability to prevent lymphocyte apoptosis, induce 
lymphocyte proliferation, and improve lymphocyte function, IL-7 has been tested by several groups in 
animal models of sepsis (25–27). These studies showed that IL-7 prevented lymphocyte apoptosis, restored 
CD4+ and CD8+ T cell function, and improved survival in animal models of bacterial and fungal sepsis 
(25–27). Importantly, IL-7 was also effective in preventing lymphocyte apoptosis, improving T cell cytokine 
production, and restoring lymphocyte metabolism in ex vivo studies conducted on peripheral blood from 
patients with septic shock (28, 29).
Although not currently approved for clinical use, CYT107, a glycosylated recombinant human IL-7, 
has been administered in clinical trials to over 390 adult and pediatric patients for a variety of disorders 
including HIV
, idiopathic lymphopenia, cancer, hepatitis C, and bone marrow reconstitution following 
stem cell transplantation (30–35). In clinical trials of HIV-infected patients who had lymphopenia despite 
antiretroviral therapy, CYT107 caused a 2- to 4-fold dose-dependent increase in circulating CD4+ and 
CD8+ T cells (31). CYT107 consistently increased circulating lymphocyte counts and was well tolerated, 
with rash being the only serious adverse effect (30–35). Recently, CYT107 was administered on a compas-
sionate basis to patients with lymphopenia and John Cunningham (JC) virus–induced progressive multifo-
cal leukoencephalopathy (36, 37). In this desperate setting, CYT107 typically increased lymphocyte counts, 
decreased JC viral load, and led to resolution of neurologic symptoms (36, 37).

We conducted a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase IIb 
trial of CYT107 in patients with septic shock and severe lymphopenia of 900 lymphocytes/μl or lower. 
Clinical immunoadjuvant trials to date have targeted innate immunity. Importantly, this study repre-
sents the first immunotherapeutic trial to our knowledge focused on augmenting the adaptive immune 
system in patients with sepsis. The primary purpose of the trial was to assess the safety and tolerabil-
ity of CYT107 in this critically ill patient population with sepsis. The second goal of the trial was to 
determine if CYT107 could reverse the profound sepsis-induced lymphopenia and improve the absolute 
numbers of circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Additional aims of the study were to examine the 
effect of CYT107 on markers of lymphocyte proliferation and activation, and incidence of secondary, 
hospital-acquired infections.
Herein we show that therapy with CYT107 in septic patients was well tolerated without any evidence 
of inducing a cytokine storm or worsening ongoing inflammation. CYT107 was effective in reversing the 
profound sepsis-induced lymphopenia and caused a 3- to 4-fold increase in the absolute lymphocyte count 
and in circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Thus, CYT107 reversed a key pathogenic hallmark of sepsis 
that likely plays a major role in sepsis-associated morbidity and mortality. Given CYT107’s extensive 
safety record in critically ill patients, its ability to improve survival in multiple animal models of sepsis, 
and its documented efficacy in patients with life-threatening viral infections, additional clinical trials of 
CYT107 in sepsis should be conducted. Targeting the dysfunctional adaptive immune system in sepsis 
with IL-7 may represent a new way forward against this highly lethal disease.

Figure 2. CYT107 increases absolute lymphocyte counts. (A) 
Patients were treated with 10 μg/kg CYT107, a recombinant human 
interleukin-7 (IL-7) using 2 different dosing regimens. Both CYT107-
treated groups received CYT107 twice a week for the first week. 
Thereafter, one group was treated with CYT107 once a week (low 
frequency) while the second CYT107 treated group was treated with 
CYT107 twice a week (high frequency). Therapy with CYT107 was 
continued for a total of 4 weeks or until the patient was discharged 
from the hospital. The maximum number of doses of CYT107 that a 
patient could receive was 5 or 8 doses respectively for the low- and 
high-dose regimens of CYT107. All patients received injections twice 
a week. (B) The CYT107 treatment effect on average absolute lym-
phocyte counts (ALCs) was significant for both high- and low-fre-
quency treatment regimens. The gray-shaded region represents the 
upper and lower limit of normal for ALCs. The CYT107 low-frequency 
group (red color) was greater than the placebo-treated group at 
days 15 and 42, and the CYT107 high-frequency group (blue color) 
was greater than placebo-treated at days 22 and 29. *P < 0.05,

Study design and participants
This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase IIb trial of CYT107 was conducted at 4 academic 
sites, with 2 sites in the United States (Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and Washington Univer-
sity School of Medicine) and 2 sites in France (University Hospital of Limoges and Edouard Herriot Hos-
pital). Following FDA approval of the study, the Institutional Review Boards at Vanderbilt University and 
Washington University approved the protocols. For France, the study protocol was approved by the Com-
mittee for the Protection of Persons (CPP) and the National Agency for Drug Safety (ANSM). All patients 
or their legal representatives gave written informed consent prior to inclusion in the study. Both the US and 
French teams used identical protocols registered on Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02640807 and NCT02797431 
respectively, for the 2 countries. The data from all 4 sites were combined for analysis.
Inclusion criteria. Twenty-seven patients who met the criteria for vasopressor-dependent septic shock 
with at least one organ failure defined by a sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score of 2 or higher 
persisting at 48–120 hours after intensive care unit (ICU) admission were enrolled into the study (Figure 1) 
(38). See supplemental materials for further patient enrollment details and additional inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria. An additional entry criterion for inclusion was lymphopenia with an absolute lymphocyte 
count of 900 lymphocytes/μl or lower obtained within 24–48 hours prior to providing consent. Lymphope-
nia was selected as an inclusion criterion because persistent lymphopenia identifies patients with immuno-
suppression and a higher mortality (5–8).
Exclusion criteria. Patients were excluded for evidence of autoimmune disorders, active hematological 
diseases, cancer with current chemo- or radiotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids equivalent to a dose of 
300 mg/day or higher of hydrocortisone, and treatment with immunosuppressive medications.
CYT107 dosing regimens. Patients received either CYT107 (glycosylated recombinant human IL-7) or pla-
cebo via the intramuscular route. There were 2 different dosing regimens for CYT107; both groups received 
10 μg/kg CYT107 twice a week for the first week (Figure 2A). Thereafter, one group was treated with 10 μg/
kg CYT107 once a week (low frequency), while the second CYT107-treated group was treated with CYT107 
10 μg/kg twice a week (high frequency). Therapy with CYT107 was continued for a total of 4 weeks (last 
dose administered on day 25 after trial initiation) or until the patient was discharged from the hospital. The 
maximum number of doses of CYT107 that a patient could receive was 5 or 8 doses respectively for the low- 
and high-dose regimens of CYT107. All patients were injected twice a week with either placebo or CYT107 
to maintain blinding of investigators and treating physicians (see Figure 2A for protocol).
Patient characteristics. There were no significant differences in the patient age, gender, site of infection, 
ICU days, SOFA, or acute physiologic assessment and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II scores (Table 
1). The most common sites of infection were pneumonia and abdominal infection (peritonitis). Pneumonia 
was present in 6 of 17 (35%) CYT107-treated patients and 3 of 10 (30%) of placebo-treated patients. Peri-
tonitis was present in 6 of 17 (35%) of CYT107-treated patients and 3 of 10 (30%) placebo-treated patients.

Safety and tolerability of CYT107
Of the 27 patients who were randomized into the study, 9 patients were randomized to the high-frequency 
regimen, 8 patients were randomized to the low-frequency CYT107 regimen, and 10 patients were randomized 
into placebo. The mean number of doses of CYT107 that the patients in the low- and high-frequency protocols 
received was 4.3 ± 0.3 and 6.1 ± 0.8, respectively. CYT107 was well tolerated with no evidence of induction of 
cytokine storm or excessive inflammation. Specifically, administration of CYT107 was not temporally associ-
ated with new onset or worsening of existing fever, tachycardia, hypotension, or evidence of organ injury.
Serial quantification of the effect of CYT107 on the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 and the 
antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 was performed on patient plasma samples (Supplemental Figure 1, A–F; 
supplemental material available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.98960DS1). 
The baseline value for TNF-α in patients, i.e., prior to treatment with CYT107 or placebo, was 17.5 ± 3.1 
pg/ml (n = 22 patients). Most CYT107-treated patients showed no increase in TNF-α above the beginning 
baseline values, while 2 patients had a transient increase at one time point (Supplemental Figure 1C). Base-
line IL-6 levels were elevated in septic patients, i.e., 158.5 ± 30.5 pg/ml (n = 22 patients). The majority of 
CYT107-treated patients showed no effect of drug administration on IL-6. There was a modest increase in 
IL-6 levels in 2 CYT107-treated patients but also in 1 placebo-treated patient (Supplemental Figure 1A). 
Baseline IL-10 levels were elevated in septic patients, i.e., 99.0 ± 17.0 pg/ml (n = 22 patients). There was an 
increase in IL-10 in 2 CYT107-treated patients and in 1 placebo-treated patient (Supplemental Figure 1B).
Serial laboratory testing for serum creatinine, a measure of renal function, showed no difference in 
CYT107- versus placebo-treated patients (Supplemental Figure 2). Similarly, there were no differences in 
serial liver function tests in CYT107- versus placebo-treated patients (Supplemental Figure 3).
The only adverse effects attributable to CYT107 were injection site reactions varying from a grade 1–3 
rash, as scored according to the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) version 2 toxicity scale. Most injection site 
reactions that occurred were small and less than 0.5 to 2.0 cm in diameter (grade 1). Six patients developed 
a grade 2–3 injection site reaction consisting of a raised red rash without vesicles or blistering involving 
20%–70% of the surface area of one upper or lower extremity. Despite the rash, 2 patients continued to 
receive CYT107 for the entire 8-dose regimen. CYT107 therapy was discontinued in 4 patients for progres-
sion of the rash as follows: one patient discontinued after 3 doses, one patient discontinued after 4 doses, 
one patient discontinued after 6 doses, and one patient discontinued after 7 doses. Biopsies of skin rash-
es in 2 of the patients showed CD3-positive lymphocytic infiltration (Supplemental Figure 4). All rashes 
resolved without complication after completion of CYT107.
Figure 3. CYT107 increased CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts. (A) 
The effect of CYT107 on the averaged CD4+ and CD8+ T cell 
counts, considered for study duration, was significant for 
both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The low-frequency regimen (red 
color) significantly increased CD4+ and the high-frequency 
regimen (blue color) increased CD8+ T cells compared with 
placebo. Low-frequency CYT107 therapy increased CD4+ T 
cells at days 8, 15, and 22. High-frequency CYT107 therapy 
increased CD8+ T cells at day 42. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. Sta-
tistical tests were conducted using a Wald-type multiple-
degree-of-freedom method. Values reported are mean ± 
SEM. n = 10, 8, and 9 for placebo, low-frequency CYT107, and 
high-frequency CYT107-treated patients, respectively. (B) 
The effect of CYT107 on individual patient CD4+ and CD8+ 
T cell counts is presented. Note that the patients at US 
sites had quantification of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts for 6 
weeks, while the patients at French sites had quantification 
out to 4 weeks only.

CYT107 increased the absolute lymphocyte count
The major biological endpoint of the trial was to determine if CYT107 increases the absolute lymphocyte 
count in patients with sepsis. Both low- and high-frequency treatment groups significantly increased the 
absolute lymphocyte count over the course of the study (combined treatment effect: P < 0.001) (Figure 2, 
B and C). At day 29, shortly after the end of therapy, both the low- and high-frequency CYT107-treated 
patient groups had a marked and comparable 3.5- to 4.5-fold average increase in their absolute lymphocyte 
counts compared with their initial values (Figure 2B). Specifically, at day 29, the absolute lymphocyte 
counts were 2.98 ± 0.47 × 103 and 3.26 ± 0.72 × 103 lymphocytes/μl for the low- and high-frequency 
CYT107-treated groups, respectively. After baseline adjustment, at day 29 the absolute lymphocyte count 
among patients in the low- and high-frequency CYT107-treated groups was greater by 0.99 × 103 (95% 
CI: 0.14, 2.13) and 1.30 × 103 lymphocytes/μl (95% CI: 0.20, 2.40), relative to the placebo-treated group 
(combined treatment effect at day 29: P = 0.004) (Supplemental Figure 5). Note that there was a smaller 
gradual increase in the absolute lymphocyte count in the placebo-treated group by the end of 4 weeks (Fig-
ure 2B). In this regard, patients who survive sepsis typically have a slow return of their absolute lymphocyte 
count towards low-normal values while the absolute lymphocyte count usually remains low in patients who 
ultimately die of sepsis (6). The increase in the absolute lymphocyte count in both CYT107-treated groups 
approximated the upper limit of normal for most hospital laboratories, i.e., 3.5 × 103 lymphocytes/μl.
The increase in absolute lymphocyte count induced by CYT107 persists after therapy
Examination of the trajectory for the patient absolute lymphocyte counts showed that the ability of CYT107 
to increase circulating lymphocytes persisted for at least 2–4 weeks following cessation of CYT107 therapy 
Figure 4. CYT107 causes an initial drop in circulating CD8+ T cells. 
CYT107 caused an early transient decrease in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells 
prior to significantly increasing lymphocyte counts. Individual 
septic patients treated with low- and high-dose CYT107 regimens 
are depicted in red and blue color, respectively. The placebo-treated 
patients are presented as a group and depicted with a solid black line. 
At day 4, CD8+ T cells were significantly decreased in patients receiv-
ing low-frequency regimen CYT107 (red color) compared with placebo 
(P ≤ 0.05). The effect of CYT107 to decrease CD4+ T cells did not quite 
achieve statistical significance. Statistical tests were conducted using 
a Wald-type multiple-degree-of-freedom method. Values reported are 
mean ± SEM. n = 10, 8, and 9 for placebo, low-frequency CYT107, and 
high-frequency CYT107-treated patients, respectively.

C L I N I C A L  M E D I C I N E
even in the patients who received only 3 or 4 doses of CYT107 (Figure 2, B and C). Specifically, at day 42, 
the absolute lymphocyte count among patients in the low- and high-frequency CYT107 groups were, after 
baseline adjustment, greater by 1.83 × 103 (95% CI: 0.57, 3.18) and 1.22 × 103 lymphocytes/μl (95% CI: 
–0.01, 2.44), on average relative to the placebo-treated group (combined treatment effect at day 42: P = 0.001) 
(Supplemental Figure 5). Note that although day 42 was the final time point for which absolute lymphocyte 
count was quantified, it is likely that the CYT107-induced increase in lymphocytes persisted beyond day 42. 
Previous clinical trials of CYT107 have demonstrated that the increase in absolute lymphocyte counts may 
continue for as long as a year after CYT107 administration is discontinued (31).
CYT107 increased CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
The effect of CYT107 to increase the absolute lymphocyte count was paralleled by its effect to increase 
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, 2 major cell types comprising the absolute lymphocyte count (Figure 3). When 
considered over the entire study period, CYT107 administration had a significant impact on the number 
of circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (combined treatment effects: P < 0.001 and P = 0.004, respectively). 
At the end of the 28-day treatment regimen, both low- and high-frequency CYT107 dosing schedules 
caused approximately 4-fold increases in CD4+ T cells compared with their baseline, pre-CYT107-therapy 
values. Specifically, after baseline adjustment, at day 29, CD4+ T cell counts among patients in the low- 
and high-frequency CYT107-treated groups were greater by 0.32 × 103 (95% CI: –0.04, 0.68) and 0.28 × 
103 lymphocytes/μl (95% CI: –0.07, 0.63), on average relative to the placebo-treated group (combined 
treatment effect at day 29: P = 0.021, Supplemental Figure 6A). CD8+ T cell counts among patients in the 
low-frequency CYT107-treated group were not substantially greater (0.12 × 103 lymphocytes/μl; 95% CI: 
–0.66, 0.90) at day 29, relative to the placebo-treated group. In the high-frequency CYT107 group at days 
29 and 42, CD8+ T cell counts were greater by 0.76 × 103 (95% CI: –0.00, 1.52) and 1.39 × 103 lympho-
cytes/μl (95% CI: 0.37, 2.31), respectively, relative to placebo (combined treatment effects at days 29 and 
42: P = 0.030 and P = 0.029, respectively; Supplemental Figure 6B).
CYT107 causes a transient decrease in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells prior to the sustained 
increase
Pharmacodynamic studies demonstrate an initial, brief (24–48 hours) decrease in circulating lymphocytes fol-
lowing IL-7 administration. This decrease is coincident with upregulation of lymphocyte adhesion molecules

lute monocyte counts. (A) The top right panel depicts the 
patients’ absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs) with the shaded

Septic patients had an increase in their ANCs that returned 
to the normal range as their sepsis improved. There was an 
overall treatment effect of CYT107 on ANC. Further, there 
was an effect of high-frequency CYT107 to increase ANCs 
at weeks 3, 4, and 6. The top left panel depicts patients’

and homing of lymphocytes from the circulation and into various tissues such as skin and intestine, and to sites 
of infection (39, 40). In the present study, at day 4 after initiation of CYT107 treatment, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell 
counts in both low- and high-frequency treatment groups trended in the negative direction being, on average, 
31.4% and 25.4% lower, respectively, than their day 0 values (Figure 4). In contrast, in placebo-treated patients, 
absolute numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells increased by 14.4% and 27.9%, respectively. In comparing 
CYT107 treatment groups with placebo, the low-frequency CYT107-treated group had a significant reduction 
in CD8+ T cells by 0.10 × 103 lymphocytes/μl (95% CI: 0.03, 0.19; P = 0.009), on average, at day 4 (Figure 4).
CYT107 effect on absolute neutrophil, monocyte, and B cell counts
The effect of CYT107 on patients’ absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs) and absolute monocyte counts 
(AMCs) was examined. Early during the course of their sepsis, both CYT107- and placebo-treated patients 
had increased ANCs compared with normal healthy volunteers (Figure 5 and Supplemental Figure 6, C and 
D). The ANCs returned to normal values later in the patients’ recovery. There was no effect of CYT107 on 
ANCs through week 2. However, there was an effect of the high- but not low-frequency dosing regimen of 
CYT107 at week 3 to increase ANCs (P < 0.01). In addition to the overall effect, the high-dose group showed 
increases of 13.16 × 103 cells/μl (95% CI: 5.74, 20.58), 7.55 × 103 cells/μl (95% CI: 2.38, 12.72), and 5.31 
× 103 cells/μl (95% CI: 0.28, 10.33), at days 22 (P < 0.001), 29 (P = 0.004), and 42 (P = 0.038), respectively 
(Figure 5 and Supplemental Figure 6D). The statistical difference in ANCs in the CYT107-treated patients 
versus placebo-treated patients persisted until week 6; however, at that time, the averaged ANCs were within 
normal limits (shaded area) and quantitative differences between groups were small and of questionable 
biologic significance. The AMCs were similar for CYT107- and placebo-treated patients and were gener-
ally within the normal range for healthy volunteers, (Figure 5 and Supplemental Figure 6C). The effect of 
CYT107 on the absolute number of B cells was examined in a subset of patients (n = 13). There was no 
apparent effect of CYT107 to increase the absolute number of B cells (Supplemental Figure 7) and these 
results are in agreement with other clinical studies of CYT107-treated patients (30).
CYT107 increased cell cycling
To evaluate potential mechanisms for the effect of CYT107 to increase lymphocyte counts, Ki67 was measured 
in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by flow cytometry. CYT107-treated patients had a brisk increase in the percentage of 
Ki67-positive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells occurring within 4–7 days after starting CYT107 (Figure 6) (combined 
Figure 6. CYT107 increased lymphocyte proliferation. (A) 
CYT107 increased the percentage of Ki67-positive CD4+ and 
CD8+ T cells from approximately 10% at pre–CYT107 treat-
ment to approximately 46% and 22%, respectively, on aver-
age for both CYT107 treatment groups. In contrast, there was 
no significant change in the percentage of cells that were 
Ki67 positive in placebo-treated patients. There was an over-
all treatment effect on Ki67 in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, 
individually showing an effect of low-dose CYT107 therapy to 
increase Ki67 in CD4+ T cells and both regimens to increase 
Ki67 in CD8+ T cells as compared with placebo. Additionally, 
in CD4+ T cells the low-frequency group displayed increased 
Ki67 at days 4, 8, 22, 29, and 42, while in CD8+ T cells, the 
high-frequency group showed increases at days 15 and 29, 
and both treatment groups at day 8 as compared with pla-
cebo. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01. Statistical tests were conducted

from approximately 10% at pre-CYT107 treatment to approximately 57.6% and 37.9% for low- and high-fre-
quency treatment groups, respectively, versus approximately 15% for placebo at day 8. At day 4, the percentage 
of Ki67-positive CD4+ T cells was higher in the low-frequency CYT107-treated group compared with placebo, by 
23.6% (95% CI: 6.8, 40.5; P = 0.006) on average. Significant differences were also present on days 8 (P < 0.001), 
22 (P = 0.053), 29 (P = 0.033), and 42 (P = 0.039). After adjusting for baseline, there was insufficient evidence of 
differences in Ki67-positive CD4+ T cells in the high-frequency CYT107-treated patients versus placebo. CYT107 
had a significant impact on Ki67-positive CD8+ T cells (combined treatment effect: P = 0.010). At day 8, Ki67-
positive CD8+ T cells were greater by 17.1% (95% CI: 6.78, 27.3; P = 0.001) and 14.2% (95% CI: 4.2, 24.1; P = 
0.005) in the low- and high-frequency CYT107 groups, respectively, on average versus placebo. Significant differ-
ences were also present on day 15 (P = 0.010) for the high-frequency treatment group (Figure 6).
CYT107 decreased IL-7 receptor α (CD127) expression
IL-7 receptor α (CD127) is a subunit of the IL-7 receptor complex. Studies show that administration of 
IL-7 to patients results in a rapid and transient downregulation of IL-7 receptor α (23, 32). In the present 
study, there was significant evidence that CYT107 affected CD127 expression on both CD+4 and CD8+ T 
cells (combined treatment effect: P = 0.002 and P < 0.001, respectively) (Figure 7). In the low-frequency 
IL-7 group at day 4, there was a significant decrease in CD127-positive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, by 19.1% 
(95% CI: 4.4, 33.9; P = 0.011) and 26.04% (95% CI: 8.5, 44.4; P = 0.004) respectively, versus placebo. Insuf-
ficient evidence was found in comparing the high-frequency group versus placebo.
CYT107 increases early lymphocyte activation markers but not PD-1 expression
We also examined the effect of CYT107 on 2 early T cell activation markers, i.e., CD38 and HLA-DR, and 
on programmed cell death 1 (PD-1; CD279). There was significant evidence of a combined treatment effect 
of CYT107 on CD38 in CD4+ T cells (P = 0.004) (Figure 8A). There was no statistically significant effect of 
CYT107 on CD38 expression in CD8+ T cells (Supplemental Figure 7A). There was insufficient evidence 
for a combined treatment effect of CYT107 on HLA-DR expression. Although there was no overall effect 
by the high-frequency dosing regimen of CYT107 on HLA-DR in CD4+ T cells, the effect to increase the 
percentage of cells expressing HLA-DR did approach statistical significance at days 7 and 22, with an 
increase from approximately 5% to an additional 2.20% (95% CI: –0.19, 4.59; P = 0.07) and 2.13% (95%

transiently downregulated after administration of IL-7. Flow

CD8+ T cell expression of IL-7 receptor α in patients treated 
with both low- and high-frequency treatment regimens of 
CYT107 versus placebo at day 4. *P < 0.05. Statistical tests

patients had flow cytometric quantification of Ki67 for 6 
weeks, while French study patients had flow cytometric 
quantification out to 4 weeks only. Baseline adjustment 
reflects the difference between study day values and the 
predosing values.

CI: –0.05,4.3; P = 0.055), respectively (Figure 8B). CYT107 did not increase HLA-DR expression on CD8+ 
T cells (Supplemental Figure 8A). There was insufficient evidence of an overall effect of either low- or high-
frequency regimens of CYT107 on PD-1 expression (Supplemental Figure 8B). The gating strategy used 
for flow cytometric identification of cell surface markers is illustrated in Supplemental Figures 9 and 10.
Incidence of secondary infections in the treatment groups
The development of hospital-acquired secondary infections was evaluated by a 3-member panel of expe-
rienced intensive care physicians using the Center for Disease Control criteria for healthcare-associated 
infections. The panel members were blinded to patient identity and treatment group. Four of 10 (40%) 
of placebo-treated patients versus 5 of 17 (30%) of CYT107-treated patients developed hospital-acquired 
infections and this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.72, Fisher’s exact test). Sites of second-
ary infections included ventilator-associated pneumonia, ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis, wound 
infections, peritonitis, mediastinitis, knee joint infection, and urinary tract infection.
Mortality in CYT107- and placebo-treated patients
Patients were followed for 120 days after study entry. At the end of the 28-day treatment period, 1 of 10 
(10%) placebo-treated patients and 2 of 17 (12%) of CYT107-treated patients had died (P = 0.855, Fisher’s 
exact test) (Table 2). At day 120, 2 of 10 (20%) of placebo-treated patients and 5 of 17 (29%) of the CYT107-
treated patients had died and this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.687, Fisher’s exact test). 
Causes of death, length of stay in the ICU, and important clinical details that impacted mortality in the 
patient population are presented in Table 2. Importantly, failure of source control and delayed recognition of 
ongoing sources of sepsis were contributing factors in mortality in a number of patients. This issue of lack of 
source control is likely due to the preponderance of surgical ICU patients with sepsis included in this study. 
One CYT107-treated patient with severe preexisting coronary artery disease and third-degree heart block 
recovered from his admission for sepsis due to necrotizing fasciitis but died 63 days later of complications 
from myocardial infarction. One patient in the placebo-treated group died of delayed complications from 
severe hypoglycemic brain injury when the family decided to change to comfort measures only.
Pharmacokinetics for CYT107
CYT107 plasma levels were measured at 1, 3, 5, 9, and 24 hours after intramuscular administration at day 
1 and day 22 (blue and red curves, respectively; Figure 9). At day 1, the Cmax 443 ng/ml was observed at 9 
hours with an AUC of 7,472.6 pg/ml⋅h. At day 22, the Cmax 420 ng/ml was observed at 5 hours with an 
AUC of 4,358.3 pg/ml⋅h.

high-frequency dosing regimen for CYT107 (upper right panel, blue

Immunogenicity for detection of antibodies against CYT107
Immunogenicity studies for detection of antibodies against the recombinant human CYT107 employed in 
this trial were performed at days 0, 11, 22, and 60 for all 17 CYT107-treated patients and were negative for 
antibody detection (see supplemental material).
Discussion
The present study of CYT107 in patients with sepsis has several potentially unique aspects. First, CYT107’s 
immune-boosting effects stand in marked contrast to the overwhelming majority of previous clinical trials 
in sepsis that have employed therapies to block inflammation and the host immune response (20, 21, 41–
45). A second potentially unique aspect is that it represents the first trial to our knowledge that focuses on 
reversing sepsis-induced defects in adaptive immunity, i.e., CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The few prior immu-
noadjuvant drug therapy trials that sought to enhance immunity in septic patients employed cytokines 
and growth factors, e.g., IFN-γ, G-CSF, and GM-CSF, to increase the number and function of monocytes, 
macrophages, and neutrophils, which are key cellular components of the innate immune system. In addi-
tion to suppressing innate immunity, sepsis significantly impairs adaptive immunity by causing extensive 
apoptotic death and dysfunction of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, the key cellular targets of CYT107 (2–5). 
In the current study, over 60% of septic patients had an initial CD4+ T cell count of less than 200 cells/
μl, one of the criteria used to define AIDS (Figure 4). The potential impact of low CD4+ T cell counts in 
sepsis is underscored by reports demonstrating a direct correlation between decreased CD4+ T cells and 
increased incidence of opportunistic infections and death (12, 13). Furthermore, numerous investigators 
have demonstrated a close correlation between low absolute lymphocyte counts and increased mortality 
in sepsis (5–8). Collectively, these reports, considered together with investigations demonstrating that pre-
venting sepsis-induced lymphocyte depletion improves survival (25, 26, 15–18), underscore the potential 
significance of the present findings in which CYT107 caused a 3- to 4-fold increase in absolute lympho-
cyte counts and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in patients with septic shock (Figures 2B and 3).
The profound decrease in circulating lymphocytes in sepsis is mirrored by concomitant decreases in 
tissue lymphocytes in spleens and other organs in which the number of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is often less 
than 10%–30% of that present in organs from nonseptic patients (1, 46). Although the present study did not 
address the effect of CYT107 on tissue lymphocytes, numerous studies in animals, including nonhuman 
primates treated with CYT107 demonstrate that the robust increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells present in 
the blood is accompanied by a significant increase in lymphocytes in spleens and lymph nodes as well (35). 
Furthermore, HIV-infected patients who had incomplete immune restoration despite receiving antiretrovi-
ral therapy and who were treated with CYT107 had markedly increased numbers of CD3+ T cells repopu-
lating their lymphocyte-depleted colons (47). Combined computerized tomography scanning and positron 
emission tomography (CT-PET) of cancer patients treated with CYT107 showed spleen, mediastinal, and

abdominal lymph node enlargement associated with increased cellular metabolic activity in these organs 
(35). Therefore, the increase in circulating immune effector cells in septic patients treated with CYT107 
likely also occurred systemically in the patients’ various immune tissues including spleen and lymphoid-
associated aggregates in lung and gut.
A seemingly paradoxical effect of CYT107 that has been reported in previous clinical studies of 
CYT107 is its action to cause an initial drop in circulating lymphocytes. This decrease in circulating 
lymphocytes lasts 24–72 hours before rebounding (39, 40). Our data showed similar findings, with an 
early decrease in CD8+ T cell counts and a strong trend toward decreased CD4+ T cell counts on day 
4 in the CYT107-treated patients (Figure 4). Studies in healthy rhesus macaques established that the 
transient decrease in circulating T cells that occurs immediately after the initial dose of CYT107 is 
due to recruitment of lymphocytes from the bloodstream into various tissues including gut, skin, and 
lymph nodes (39, 40). The presumed mechanism for this trafficking of lymphocytes from the circula-
tion into these tissues is IL-7’s effect to upregulate expression of numerous chemokines and adhesion 
molecules, e.g., CXCR4, CCR7, α4β7, LFA-1, and VLA-4, on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (48–51). This 
effect of IL-7 to activate lymphocytes to increase expression of adhesion molecules and chemokines is 
also the likely explanation for the skin rashes that occurred in many CYT107-treated patients. It is pos-
sible that CYT107’s effect to increase lymphocyte adhesion molecule expression will be advantageous 
in sepsis by resulting in increased lymphocyte trafficking to sites of infection. Inflammation occurring 
at sites of infection causes endothelial and parenchymal cells to upregulate the corresponding receptor 
and/or ligand partners for the adhesion molecules and chemokines expressed on the CD4+ and CD8+ 
T cells. The overall effect will be migration of immune effector cells to sites of infection and enhanced 
pathogen killing. In this regard, studies demonstrated that mice with viral hepatitis that were treated 
with CYT107 had a 3- to 4-fold increase in the number of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells present in the infected 
liver and an accompanying dramatic improvement in viral clearance compared with control mice (52).
The increase in lymphocytes in CYT107-treated septic patients is likely due to 2 independent mecha-
nisms. First, as is well documented in multiple clinical trials, CYT107 acts to induce proliferation of CD4+ 
and CD8+ T cells (31–33, 50). In the current study, the effect of CYT107 to stimulate lymphocyte prolifera-
tion is evidenced by the increase in the cell cycle marker Ki67 in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells of patients treated 
with CYT107 versus placebo (Figure 5). A second mechanism for the increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells

in septic patients treated with CYT107 is the potent antiapoptotic effect of IL-7 (25–29). IL-7 increases 
antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members and decreases proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members (53). Previously, 
our laboratory utilized a mouse peritonitis model of sepsis to demonstrate that CYT107 decreased apop-
tosis of splenic and lymph node naive, central memory, and effector memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by 
approximately 50% at 24 hours (26). This antiapoptotic effect was associated with an increase in Bcl-2 and 
a decrease in proapoptotic PUMA. Furthermore, 2 ex vivo studies in septic shock patients’ cells showed 
that IL-7 restored lymphocyte proliferation in response to anti–CD2-CD3-CD28 antibody–coated bead 
stimulation (28, 29). This finding was associated with increased Bcl-2 expression (28) and mTOR pathway 
reactivation leading to aerobic glycolysis restoration and thus to improved lymphocyte proliferation (29).
Important findings in the present study are data showing that the increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells 
is maintained for the entire duration of the study observation, which was at least 2–4 weeks after cessation 
of CYT107 therapy (Figures 2B, 2C, and 3). These data are in agreement with numerous clinical studies 
reporting that the effect of CYT107 to increase lymphocytes persists for several months after the end of 
CYT107 administration (32, 35). This effect of CYT107 to sustain the number of immune effector cells for 
weeks to months after stopping therapy is likely to be particularly beneficial in sepsis. Many patients sur-
vive their initial infection only to develop lethal secondary hospital-acquired infections. These nosocomial 
infections are a major cause of the approximate 30%–40% additional increase in mortality in patients with 
sepsis that occurs between days 28 and 90 (54). There was a nonstatistically significant trend toward a 25% 
decrease in secondary hospital-acquired infections in patients treated with CYT107 compared with patients 
receiving placebo.
An interesting finding in the present study is the difference in patient response to low- versus high-
frequency CYT107. In some instances, the low-frequency dosing regimen of CYT107 had a more 
robust effect than the high-frequency dosing regimen (e.g., Figures 6 and 7). We speculate that these 
differences are due to patient heterogeneity both in extent and type of comorbidities, sites of infection, 
and infecting pathogens. The fact that some differences were seen within or shortly after the first week 
(when both the low- and high-frequency CYT107 treatment groups received the same number of doses, 
i.e., exact same amount of CYT107) suggests that patient heterogeneity and changes in patient clini-
cal status rather than CYT107 was responsible for the observed effect. Similarly, we speculate that the 
increase in ANCs that was observed in patients treated with the high-frequency CYT107 dose regimen 
may have been due in part to patient heterogeneity or to changes in patient clinical status rather than 
an actual effect of CYT107. Neutrophils do not express the IL-7α receptor and previous clinical trials 
of CYT107 have not reported increases in neutrophil counts (55). The fact that CYT107 had no effect 
on the ANCs for the first 2 weeks of therapy and that there were very minor differences in ANCs in 
CYT107- and placebo-treated patients by week 6 (Figure 5) makes it less likely that CYT107 was having 
a major effect on the number of circulating neutrophils.
In a very real sense, the immune system is like an orchestra that works optimally when all its diverse 
members are functioning harmoniously. There is extensive cross talk between the various cellular com-
ponents of the innate and adaptive immune systems. CD4+ helper T cells are particularly essential for 
proper functioning of host immunity because, as their name indicates, they help to stimulate and instruct 
the phenotypic response of many other types of innate and adaptive immune effector cells. IL-7 has been 
called the “maestro of the immune system” because of its effect to activate and induce proliferation of 
these CD4+ helper T cells (56). In this regard, CD4+ T cells from patients treated with CYT107 had an 
increase in the proliferation marker Ki67 and the activation marker CD38 (Figures 6 and 7). As noted 
previously, the early decrease in circulating CD4+ T cells after initiation of CYT107 therapy is also evi-
dence of CD4+ T cell activation by CYT107. Importantly, CYT107 also increases CD4+ and CD8+ T cell 
IFN-γ production in both animal models of sepsis and in studies of peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
from patients with sepsis (25–29). IFN-γ is a potent activator of monocytes and macrophages, key com-
ponents of the innate immune system that play an essential role in pathogen killing. Although we did not 
investigate them, a relatively recently discovered mechanism of action of IL-7 is to increase the number 
and function of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and mucosal-associated invariant T cells (MAITs) (57, 58). 
ILCs and MAITs, which express the IL-7-α receptor (CD127), are present in high concentrations in lung 
and gastrointestinal tract. These cells respond rapidly to invading pathogens that enter the host through 
the pulmonary or gastrointestinal system by producing key cytokines that activate protective antimicrobial 
immune defenses. The fact that studies demonstrate that IL-7 causes a rapid improvement in survival in

selected animal models of sepsis within 24–48 hours after its administration may be due to an effect of 
IL-7 to activate these early responding ILCs and MAITs (26, 59).
Unlike some members of the common γ-chain family of cytokines, CYT107 was well tolerated without 
evidence of inducing a cytokine storm, exacerbating underlying sepsis-induced inflammation, or worsen-
ing existing organ injury (Supplemental Figures 1–3) (23, 24, 30–34). CYT107 has now been reported to 
be safe in almost 400 adult and pediatric patients with a diversity of disorders including HIV
, hepatitis C, 
cancer, idiopathic lymphopenia, and life-threatening progressive multi-focal leukoencephalopathy (30–37). 
Furthermore, doses of CYT107 up to 6 times higher than the dose used in this investigation have been 
administered to oncology patients and reported to be well tolerated (34). One likely explanation for the 
excellent safety profile of CYT107 is the unique nature of the IL-7 receptor complex, which is partly com-
posed of the IL-7 receptor α subunit (CD127) (23). Administration of CYT107 results in a rapid transitory 
decreased expression of the IL-7 receptor α chain, thereby rendering the cell less responsive to additional 
CYT107. Downregulation of IL-7 receptor α presumably prevents overstimulation of CD4+ and CD8+ T 
cells. A statistically significant decrease in IL-7 receptor α expression was observed (Figure 6). The only 
adverse effect of CYT107 in the present study was a grade 2–3 rash that resulted in early discontinuation of 
CYT107 dosing in 4 of 17 patients.
The failure of many previous therapeutic trials has generated widespread skepticism in the field toward 
potential new therapeutic approaches in sepsis (21, 42–45, 57–59). Similar skepticism toward immuno-
therapy was present in the oncology field prior to the extraordinary advances in cancer treatment that 
occurred with the discovery of checkpoint inhibitors. Remarkably, the underlying mechanisms responsible 
for immunosuppression are highly similar in both sepsis and cancer (60, 61). Given the common mecha-
nisms of immunosuppression in the 2 disorders, it is not surprising that anti–PD-1, the most widely used 
and successful immunotherapy in oncology, is also highly effective in restoring CD4+ and CD8+ T cell 
function and improving survival in animal models of sepsis (62–66). Anti–PD-1 (nivolumab) is currently in 
clinical trials in patients with sepsis (NCT02960854). This success of anti–PD-1, a second immunothera-
peutic agent whose primary target is blocking a negative regulator of T cells, provides additional sound 
theoretical support for the potential efficacy of CYT107 that, like anti–PD-1, acts primarily to restore the 
number and function of T cells. Both CYT107 and anti–PD-1 represent a transformational therapeutic 
approach by targeting a hallmark of sepsis, which is massive loss in T cells and the accompanying defect in 
adaptive immunity in sepsis.
In conclusion, CYT107 represents a promising and potentially novel approach to sepsis and is the first 
immuno-adjunctive therapy to our knowledge directed at restoring adaptive immunity in this disorder. 
Although a larger trial of CYT107 in sepsis is needed to confirm findings in the present study, CYT107 
appears safe and effective in reversing the profound loss in CD4+ and CD8+ immune effector cells, a criti-
cal pathophysiologic mechanism in sepsis. CYT107 was also effective at increasing T cell activation and 
potentially assisting in trafficking of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to sites of infection. The effect of CYT107 
to maintain lymphocyte counts continued for several weeks after cessation of drug therapy. Therefore, the 
beneficial effects of CYT107 on host immunity persist during the time at which surviving patients are high-
ly susceptible to secondary nosocomial infections. The results of the present trial considered in conjunction 
with CYT107’s demonstrable safety record in other critically ill patients and its efficacy in life-threatening 
viral infections make a compelling case for a definitive trial of CYT107 in this highly lethal disorder.
Methods
Study design. This study was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of recombi-
nant human IL-7 (CYT107) in patients with septic shock and severe lymphopenia. Twenty-seven patients 
at academic sites in France and the United States received CYT107 (in either low- or high-frequency regi-
mens) or placebo for 4 weeks. Primary aims were to determine the safety of CYT107 in sepsis and its ability 
to reverse lymphopenia. Based on the results of prior trials in patients with HIV or malignancies, a power 
calculation was performed. A sample size of 10 subjects per trial arm was found to have greater than 85% 
power to detect an equal or more extreme treatment effect to reverse lymphopenia.
Study deviations. IL-7 administration was discontinued on 4 patients due to a grade 2–3 rash forma-
tion at injection site (see Results section on patient safety). Study enrollment was halted at 27 patients 
out of a planned enrollment of 30 patients because of requirement for additional drug stability testing 
that was due at this time.

Inclusion criteria. Patients had to be between the ages of 18 and 80, have 2 or more criteria for sys-
temic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), have a clinically or microbiologically suspected infection 
(38), a SOFA score of 2 or higher at 48–120 hours after ICU admission, require vasopressor treatment, 
and an absolute lymphocyte count of 900 cells/μl or lower within 24 hours of a signed informed consent 
(see supplemental materials).
Exclusion criteria. Patients currently undergoing chemo- or radiotherapy because of cancer, current or a 
history of hematologic malignancy or lymphoma, cardiopulmonary resuscitation within 4 weeks, history 
of or current evidence of an autoimmune disorder, organ transplant recipient, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B or 
C; receiving corticosteroids at a dose of 300 mg or higher of hydrocortisone/day, receiving biologics that 
block cytokines were excluded (see supplemental materials).
Thirty-three patients were enrolled into the study but only 27 patients were dosed with drugs (Figure 
1). Three patients who were enrolled were not dosed because of marked clinical deterioration with likely 
impending demise occurring between the time of enrollment and the time of planned administration of 
drug (CYT107 or placebo). Two patients who consented were not dosed because of rapid clinical improve-
ment within 24–48 hours with resolution of signs of sepsis and SOFA scores less than 2. One patient who 
was consented was not dosed because of discovery of an exclusion criterion that had been missed earlier.
CYT107 preparation and drug dosing. CYT107, which has been extensively used in other clinical trials, 
was employed (30, 31). Patients were randomized by allocation to a permuted-block randomization (block 
size of 3 and allocation ratio of 1:1:1, stratified by country, and dosed using 3 different administration 
protocols: CYT107 high frequency, CYT107 low frequency, and placebo. CYT107 or placebo was admin-
istered by intramuscular injection. If the patient’s platelet count was below 35,000 per mm3 or the interna-
tional normalized ratio was 3.5 seconds or higher, CYT107 was administered by subcutaneous injection. 
All patients were injected twice per week for 4 weeks. All CYT107 patients received 10 μg/kg of CYT107 
twice in the first week, followed by: the same dosage, twice per week for the high-frequency regimen; and 
once per week followed by an injection of placebo (NaCl 0.9%) midweek for the low-frequency regimen. 
The control, or placebo, group was given placebo (NaCl 0.9%) twice per week.
The statistician, local pharmacist, and the central laboratory in charge of pharmacokinetic (PK)/
immunogenicity analysis were the only unblinded entities.
Blood samples were drawn for flow cytometric analysis prior to the first dose (day 0), following dosing on 
days 4, 8, 15, and 22, and then on days 29 and 42. PK samples were drawn on the initial dosing day and on 
day 22. Immunogenicity samples were collected prior to initial dosing (day 0), and then on days 11, 22, and 60.
Flow cytometry. Flow cytometric analysis was performed as previously described (28, 46) — see supple-
mental materials and methods. Cells stained with cocktails examining only surface markers were fixed in 
1% paraformaldehyde, while cells stained for intracellular markers were first surface stained, permeabilized, 
and stained for intracellular markers (Ki67). Acquisitions were analyzed with FlowJo v 10.2 (FlowJo, LLC).
Number of  CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. CD4+ and CD8+ T cell numbers were calculated using flow cytometric 
results. First, the lymphocytes were gated on FSC × SSC, and then the percentages of CD3+CD4+ cells and 
CD3+CD8+ cells were determined (Supplemental Figure 5 provides the gating strategy). The frequency of 
parent percentages was multiplied by absolute lymphocyte count and the product was used as the number 
of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively.
Molecules of  equivalent soluble fluorochrome (MESF). MESF was calculated by obtaining the population’s 
geometric mean fluorescence intensity (GMFI) and plotting it against values derived from Quantum PE 
(monocyte HLA-DR, CD279) or Quantum APC (Ki-67, CD127) beads (Bangs Lab) in Microsoft Excel.
Quantification of  circulating cytokines IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α via ELISA. Cytokine kits for TNF-α, IL6, 
and IL-10 were obtained from Biolegend and R&D Systems — see supplemental materials and methods. 
Assays were performed exactly as per the manufacturer’s instructions and as previously described (46).
PK and immunogenicity analysis. PK and immunogenicity testing were carried out by Eurofins ADME 
BIOANALYSES.
For PK analysis, CYT107 was measured in EDTA-3K plasma samples using a validated DIACLONE 
ELISA kit (catalog 851.680.020). The method includes a capture CYT107 antibody and a biotinylated 
detection antibody. The results obtained during the validation studies are reported in a Eurofins full bio-
analytical report.
For immunogenicity testing, anti-CYT107 antibodies were detected in heparin-Li plasma samples. Briefly 
the ability of plasma samples to bind CYT107 are compared with a positive anti–rh-CYT107 IgG (Preprotech)

in a preliminary screening test aimed at detecting anti-CYT107 binding antibodies. Positive samples from this 
screening assay are then spiked with CYT107 to displace and detect the specificity of the binding activity.
Statistics. Comparisons across treatment groups at baseline were performed using the Kruskal-Wallis 
test and Fisher’s exact test. Each outcome variable (e.g., absolute lymphocyte count) was baseline adjusted 
by subtracting the corresponding baseline value. Baseline-adjusted outcomes were then analyzed using 
linear mixed-effects regression, adjusting for study day (as a categorical variable), treatment group, and the 
interaction between study day and treatment group. All figures show values plotted as mean ± SEM (see 
supplemental methods for additional details).
Study approval. This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase IIb trial of CYT107 was 
conducted at 4 academic sites, with 2 sites in the United States (Vanderbilt University and Washington 
University ) and 2 sites in France (University Hospital of Limoges and Edouard Herriot Hospital). Fol-
lowing FDA approval of the study, the Institutional Review Boards at Vanderbilt University (IRB 152001) 
and Washington University (IRB 20161106) approved the protocols. For France, the study protocol was 
approved by the CPP and ANSM. All patients or their legal representatives gave written informed consent 
prior to study inclusion.
