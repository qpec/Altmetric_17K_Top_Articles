Olfactory dysfunction is common in Parkinson’s disease and is an early symptom, but its pathogenesis remains poorly understood.
Hindering progress in our mechanistic understanding of olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson’s disease is the paucity of literature about
the human olfactory bulb, both from normal and Parkinson’s disease cases. Qualitatively it is well established that the neat arrange-
ment of the glomerular array seen in the mouse olfactory bulb is missing in humans. But rigorous quantitative approaches to describe
and compare the thousands of glomeruli in the human olfactory bulb are not available. Here we report a quantitative approach to
describe the glomerular component of the human olfactory bulb, and its application to draw statistical comparisons between olfactory
bulbs from normal and Parkinson’s disease cases. We subjected horizontal 10 mm sections of olfactory bulbs from six normal and five
Parkinson’s disease cases to fluorescence immunohistochemistry with antibodies against vesicular glutamate transporter-2 and neural
cell adhesion molecule. We scanned the immunostained sections with a fluorescence slide scanner, segmented the glomeruli, and
generated 3D reconstructions of whole olfactory bulbs. We document the occurrence of atypical glomerular morphologies and
glomerular-like structures deep in the olfactory bulb, both in normal and Parkinson’s disease cases. We define a novel and objective
parameter: the global glomerular voxel volume, which is the total volume of all voxels that are classified immunohistochemically as
glomerular. We find that the global glomerular voxel volume in Parkinson’s disease cases is half that of normal cases. The distri-
bution of glomerular voxels along the dorsal-ventral dimension of the olfactory bulb in these series of horizontal sections is signifi-
cantly altered in Parkinson’s disease cases: whereas most glomerular voxels reside within the ventral half of olfactory bulbs from
normal cases, glomerular voxels are more evenly spread among the ventral and dorsal halves of olfactory bulbs from Parkinson’s
disease cases. These quantitative whole-olfactory bulb analyses indicate a predominantly ventral deficit in the glomerular component
in Parkinson’s disease, consistent with the olfactory vector hypothesis for the pathogenesis of this neurodegenerative disease. The
distribution of serine 129-phosphorylated a-synuclein immunoreactive voxels correlates with that of glomerular voxels. The higher
the serine 129-phosphorylated a-synuclein load of an olfactory bulb from a Parkinson’s disease case, the lower the global glomerular
voxel volume. Our rigorous quantitative approach to the whole olfactory bulb will help understand the anatomy and histology of the
normal human olfactory bulb and its pathological alterations in Parkinson’s disease.

 Introduction
The human olfactory mucosa is located in the superior aspect
of the nasal cavity, just below the cribriform plate, on the
nasal septum and on the turbinates (Fig. 1A) (Leopold et al.,
2000). Mature olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) extend a
single apical dendrite that ends in a ciliated dendritic knob
(Morrison and Costanzo, 1990). These bipolar neurons pro-
ject their axon through the cribriform plate from the nasal to
the cranial cavity. Within the olfactory bulb, the OSN axon
terminates in one of several thousand structures of condensed
neuropil called glomeruli. Immunohistochemical studies of the
human olfactory bulb have revealed basic organizational
characteristics, including a superficial olfactory nerve layer
that feeds axons into glomeruli situated below (Nakashima
et al., 1985; Smith et al., 1991; Maresh et al., 2008).
Interneuron populations of the human olfactory bulb have
thus far undergone only rudimentary analyses (Smith et al.,
1993). Despite the overall similarities in the anatomical or-
ganization of the olfactory bulb between human and mouse,
there are unmistakable differences. The glomerular array, as
evaluated in sections of human olfactory bulbs, is not as
neatly arranged as in mouse: co-labelling sections of human
olfactory bulbs with antibodies against vesicular glutamate
transporter 2 (VGLUT2, encoded by SLC17A6) and neural
cell adhesion molecule (NCAM, encoded by NCAM1) re-
vealed a level of complexity not anticipated (Maresh et al.,
2008). The mouse has �3600 glomeruli in an olfactory bulb
(Richard et al., 2010) and 1087 expressed odorant receptor
genes in its genome (Saraiva et al., 2015); the axons of the
population of mouse OSNs that express a given odorant re-
ceptor gene coalesce into a few homogeneous glomeruli per
olfactory bulb (Mombaerts et al., 1996; Treloar et al., 2002).
But with counts of glomeruli in the human olfactory bulb
averaging 5568 (Maresh et al., 2008), and �400 odorant
receptor genes in the human genome (Malnic et al., 2004),

glomeruli. (D) Pipeline of image processing and segmentation used the fluorescent signal to identify glomerular objects for manual verification and

 the ratio of two to three glomeruli per odorant receptor gene
does not extend to humans.
The literature on the anatomy and histology of the
human olfactory bulb is scant compared to the wealth of
knowledge that has been collected about the mouse olfac-
tory bulb. The relevance of a greater understanding of the
human olfactory bulb has gained medical relevance in
recent years due to the mounting body of evidence for ol-
factory dysfunction in Parkinson’s disease (Ansari and
Johnson, 1975; Doty et al., 1988; Doty, 2012) and for
initiation of pathology in the olfactory bulb (Braak et al.,
2003a, 2004; Beach et al., 2009; Adler and Beach, 2016).
Olfactory dysfunction has a prevalence of �90% in early-
stage sporadic Parkinson’s disease, and is one of the earliest
symptoms, typically occurring well before the onset of
motor symptoms. The characteristic and diagnostic path-
ology of Parkinson’s disease is the loss of dopaminergic
neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, accompa-
nied with the accumulation of Lewy bodies and Lewy neur-
ites in this and other regions of the brain. Lewy bodies and
Lewy neurites are intraneural inclusions that consist pre-
dominantly of fibrils formed by misfolded and aggregated
a-synuclein (Spillantini et al., 1997) phosphorylated at resi-
due Ser129 (pSer129) (Fujiwara et al., 2002). Lewy bodies
and Lewy neurites are frequently detectable in the olfactory
bulb and anterior olfactory nucleus (Daniel and Hawkes,
1992), before they spread to other parts of the brain such
as the substantia nigra (Del Tredici et al., 2002; Braak
et al., 2003b). The olfactory vector hypothesis (Doty,
2012) proposes that the olfactory system provides a route
for xenobiotics (such as viruses, metals, herbicides) to trig-
ger Parkinson’s disease. The human olfactory mucosa is
directly exposed to the outside air, and OSNs are first-
order neurons that project their axons into the brain. The
olfactory bulb may also be an entry site for prion-like
propagation in other human neurodegenerative diseases
(Rey et al., 2017).
Here, we have subjected horizontal 10-mm section series
of human olfactory bulbs from six normal cases and five
Parkinson’s disease cases to fluorescence immunohisto-
chemistry for VGLUT2 and NCAM. We also stained a
subset of sections for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and for
pSer129 a-synuclein. We developed a novel pipeline for
image processing, and generated 3D reconstructions of
the individual whole olfactory bulbs. To accommodate
the absence of a neat arrangement of the glomerular
array in the human olfactory bulb, we defined a novel par-
ameter: the global glomerular voxel volume (GGVV),
which is the sum of the volume of all voxels that are clas-
sified immunohistochemically as glomerular. We found that
the higher the load of pSer129 a-synuclein, the lower the
GGVV, suggesting a causal relationship. Our analyses
reveal a predominantly ventral deficit in the glomerular
component in Parkinson’s disease. This finding is consistent
with the olfactory vector hypothesis for the pathogenesis of
this neurodegenerative disease.
Materials and methods
Tissue acquisition
Post-mortem human olfactory bulbs were procured from the
Neurological Foundation Douglas Human Brain Bank at the
Centre for Brain Research, University of Auckland, New
Zealand. Informed consent of the family was obtained prior
to autopsy. The University of Auckland Human Participants
Ethics Committee approved the protocols (Ref: 011654). The
normal olfactory bulbs were from cases that had no known
clinical history of neurological disease and no apparent patho-
logical abnormalities upon examination. The Parkinson’s dis-
ease cases had a disease duration ranging from 9 to 20 years,
with an average of 13.2 years (Table 1). Pathological examin-
ation by a neuropathologist revealed Lewy bodies in the sub-
stantia nigra and frontal lobe, and pigment incontinence and
cell loss in the substantia nigra, confirming the diagnosis of
Parkinson’s disease.
Tissue collection and preparation
Upon arrival at the Human Brain Bank, specimens were fixed
with 15% formaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer for 24 h at
room temperature. Olfactory bulbs that passed a visual quality
control for gross morphology were dehydrated in a graded
ethanol series, and embedded in paraffin wax using a Leica
Tissue Processor. Dehydration comprised sequential steps of
70%, 80%, 2 � 95%, and 3 � 100% ethanol for 20 min
each at room temperature. Next the tissue was cleared in
xylene, 2 � 30 min, and impregnated with molten paraffin
wax during three cycles of 25 min each. Paraffin blocks with
embedded olfactory bulbs were cooled to 4�C and sectioned
horizontally at a thickness of 10 mm on a rotary microtome
(Leica Biosystems, RM2235). Cut sections were floated in a
waterbath
set
at
37–39�C
(Leica
Biosystems,
HI1210),
mounted individually on Superfrost
TM Plus slides (Menzel-
Gla
¨ser), and air-dried for 18 h at room temperature.
Immunohistochemistry
Slides were heated to 60�C for 1 h to melt the paraffin wax.
Slides were cleared in xylene (2 � 1 h at 60�C), and rehydrated
in an ethanol series: 2 � 100% (10 min), 1 � 95% (10 min),
1 � 80% (5 min) and 1 � 75% ethanol (5 min) followed by
3 � distilled H2O (5 min). Heat-induced epitope retrieval was
performed with a Tris-EDTA (pH 9.0) buffer in a pressure
cooker (2100 Antigen Retriever, Aptum Biologics Ltd.) for
2 h at 121�C. Following cooling, slides were washed for
5 min in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and permeabilized
twice in PBST (0.2% Triton
TM X-100 in PBS) for 5 min each.
The slides were blocked for 1 h in 10% normal donkey serum
(Millipore #S30) or 10% normal goat serum (Gibco #16210-
072). Primary antibodies were diluted in PBST, and the slides
were incubated for 24–72 h at 4�C in a humidified chamber.
Slides were washed once in PBST and twice in PBS for 5 min
each. Secondary antibodies were diluted to 1:1000 (donkey
antibodies) or 1:400 (goat antibodies), and the solution was
placed on the slides for 3 h at room temperature. Slides were
washed for 5 min in PBS, and then submerged for 5 min in PBS
containing a 1:20 000 dilution of Hoechst 33342 (Molecular

Slides were coverslipped with ProLong� Gold (Molecular

Alexa Fluor� 488 (Invitrogen #A11029).
For fluorescence quenching and restaining, the coverslips
from stained and imaged sections were removed, and slides
washed in PBST to remove ProLong� Gold. Sections were
placed on ice for 2 � 3 h covered with H2O2 quenching solu-
tion (3% H2O2 pH 9.5), and exposed to light emitted from a
light bulb. Sections were washed with PBS and covered with
H2O2 quenching solution overnight at room temperature.
Sections were then washed in PBS, blocked in normal goat
serum, immunostained, and biotinylated rabbit anti-a-synu-
clein phospho S129 was revealed with Streptavidin-Alexa
Fluor� 488 (1:400; Invitrogen #S11223).
Case OFB41 was stained for VGLUT2, NCAM, and b-III
tubulin using donkey secondary antibodies. Cases OFB43 and
PD42 were stained for VGLUT2 and NCAM with complete
coverage, and every third slide for TH, all in combination with
donkey secondary antibodies. Cases OFB42, OFB48, PD30,
and PD50 were stained for VGLUT2, NCAM, and b-III
tubulin using donkey secondary antibodies. After scanning
the slides, a subset underwent fluorescence quenching and
stained
for
a-synuclein
phospho
S129-biotin
and
Streptavidin-Alexa Fluor� 488. Cases OFB58, OFB59, PD52,
and PD53 were initially stained at every third section for
VGLUT2 and NCAM in combination with donkey secondary
antibodies. Another set of unstained slides were stained for
VGLUT2, a-synuclein phospho S129, and TH in combination
with goat secondary antibodies.
Image processing
The Ethics Council of the Max Planck Society (Ethikrat der
Max-Planck-Gesellschaft) approved the scanning of the stained
sections in the Max Planck Research Unit for Neurogenetics in
Frankfurt, Germany. Slides were scanned using a Pannoramic
MIDI fluorescence digital slide scanner (3DHISTECH). Images
were processed using a custom pipeline that we developed spe-
cifically for these studies. Section alignment and 3D visualiza-
tion of data were performed with Amira software (FEI,
Hillsboro, OR, USA). Aligned sections were then processed
using a CellProfiler pipeline (Carpenter et al., 2006) pro-
grammed to segment VGLUT2-stained glomeruli on olfactory
bulb sections. A morph operation was performed to fill in
small gaps of signal within glomeruli. Segmented pixels were
corrected manually to remove false positives and false nega-
tives using the segmentation toolkit in Amira. Segmented
images of sections were subjected to volumetric analyses in
Amira or MATLAB.

 reconstructed olfactory bulbs was performed on segmented 3D
reconstructions that comprised stacks of indexed images. Each
pixel was contained within a region of interest defined either
as olfactory bulb (automatically segmented from the black
pixels surrounding the olfactory bulb and manually separated
from the lateral olfactory tract just beyond the most posterior
glomerulus), glomerular, TH+ , or pSer129 a-synuclein + . As
the 10-mm sections were imaged using a widefield fluorescence
scanner, each image plane had a thickness of 10 mm. When the
images were stacked atop each other, the pixels (�1 mm � 1 mm)
resulted in voxels of �1 mm � 1 mm � 10mm ( = 10mm3). Thus,
a perfectly spherical glomerulus with a diameter of 60 mm is
represented by 11350 voxels.
Depth analysis was performed by generating a custom multi-
layer mask for each olfactory bulb, with each layer converging
toward the core of the olfactory bulb. The 3D datasets con-
taining glomerular, TH + , or pSer129 a-synuclein + voxels
were then tagged as belonging to one of these layers, and
the number of voxels within each layer was quantified, thus
binning the voxels according to their depth profiles. Data were
visualized with the help of a false-colour look-up table (span-
ning across blue, green, yellow, and red) that coloured the
voxels according to their layer (from superficial to deep).
Datasets were normalized to the sum of each category of
voxels for an olfactory bulb and to the depth profile along
10 bins spanning from the surface to the core.
For analysis of the spatial distribution of glomerular voxels
in the dorsal-ventral dimension, the indexed pixel images were
exported in coronal format, with one image per pixel along the
anterior–posterior axis perpendicular to the plane of section-
ing. A custom MATLAB script processed the exported images
of virtual coronal sections of the olfactory bulb. The outline of
the olfactory bulb was used to define the midline in both
dorsal-ventral and medial-lateral aspects. Each image was
divided along these midlines producing four images, one for
each quadrant. The quadrants were further bisected diag-
onally resulting in octants. A coronal virtual section was
thus subdivided into eight sectors. Glomerular pixels were
quantified for each octant, and the voxel quantities were cal-
culated as mm3 values for each quadrant or summed to de-
termine the GGVV.
The 3D density heat map analysis was performed on seg-
mented glomerular datasets in Amira. The cluster density tool
was used to interrogate the neighbourhood of each glomerular
voxel for other glomerular voxels. The output of this analysis
indicated how many glomerular voxels were present in a
spherical neighbourhood corresponding to a 300 -mm radius.
The value itself was a count of glomerular voxels within the
prescribed radius. The visualization of these data was per-
formed by applying a pseudocolour gradient along the value
range of the counts, with the highest density voxels labelled in
red, intermediate density in yellow, and lowest density in grey–
black.
Statistical analysis
Global glomerular voxel volumes were compared using a two-
tailed t-test with Welch’s correction for unequal variances and
sample sizes in GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software Inc.)
resulting in t = 2.464, df = 8, and a P-value of 0.0391. The
alpha
values
for
significance
were
set
as:
*P 4 0.05,
**P 4 0.01, and ***P 4 0.001. Testing for glomerular voxels
in dorsal versus ventral half of the olfactory bulb was also
performed using a two-tailed Welch’s t-test accounting for un-
equal variances and sample sizes in GraphPad Prism 5, and
resulted in t = 5.976, df = 6, and a P-value of 0.0010. Pearson
correlation coefficients for depth profile analysis were deter-
mined using GraphPad Prism 5.
Results
Because of the precious nature of human brain samples,
extensive means were taken to obtain the maximum
amount of information from the available material. With
the goal of comparing the 3D organization of the glom-
erular array in the olfactory bulbs between normal and
Parkinson’s disease cases, we first chose an approach
based on immunohistochemistry for VGLUT2, NCAM,
and b-III tubulin. The staining of the olfactory nerve
layer with NCAM and b-III tubulin allowed for the veri-
fication of the orientation of the olfactory bulb in the
dorsal-ventral dimension, based on the thicker olfactory
nerve layer along the ventral aspect. Although VGLUT2
alone can label glomeruli, the imperfect laminar organiza-
tion of the human olfactory bulb and the high incidence of
background antibody staining dictated a conservative ap-
proach: only triple labelling by VGLUT2, NCAM, and b-
III tubulin would qualify for glomerular classification (Fig.
1B). After pilot experiments, we found that the co-label-
ling of VGLUT2 and NCAM proved sufficient in defining
glomerular structures (Fig. 1C), as was the experience of
Maresh et al. (2008). Our image processing procedure
consisted of aligning scans of horizontal sections using
Amira followed by a CellProfiler-based pipeline using
image math, a mixture-of-Gaussians thresholding, and
object morphing. This procedure permits the segmentation
of immunohistochemistry images for 3D reconstruction
and analysis (Fig. 1D).
Invasive and atypical glomeruli
Glomeruli located deep within the olfactory bulb disrupt its
laminar organization (Fig. 2A). The vast majority of the
glomeruli were located directly below the outer nerve
layer, within a less organized but still recognizable glom-
erular layer. Some OSN axon bundles projected deep into
the olfactory bulb (as deep as halfway across) and formed
numerous glomerular or glomerular-like structures, which
we term ‘invasive’. Various views of a 3D-reconstructed
olfactory bulb from a normal case illustrate the invasive
glomeruli (Fig. 2B–F). In addition to the invasive glomeruli,
human olfactory bulbs abound in structures that qualify as
glomeruli histochemically, but lack many of the typical
morphological characteristics seen in the mouse olfactory
bulb. These atypical
glomerular-like
structures
include
small glomeruli, irregularly shaped glomeruli, and tangles
of glomeruli. Invasive glomeruli exhibited a morphology
that was intact, round, or of grainy texture akin to canon-
ical glomeruli found in the glomerular layer (Fig. 2G),

To quantify the abundance of invasive glomerular voxels, a
2D-based analysis would have been suitable if the human
olfactory bulb were spherical. However, because of the
oblong and asymmetrical shape of the human olfactory
bulb, a glomerulus that appears to be located in the
centre of a section may actually reside at short distance
from the surface in the z-plane. Therefore, we developed
a 3D-based analysis. We generated a set of layers that con-
verge from the surface of the olfactory bulb toward the
core (Fig. 3A), and assigned a depth to each glomerular
voxel on the basis of the layer in which it was located.
By using these layers to mask glomerular voxels, we were
able to quantify and visualize the glomerular depth charac-
teristics of an olfactory bulb. Glomerular voxels were re-
stricted to the glomerular layer in many olfactory bulbs
(Fig. 3B). Some olfactory bulbs had extensive glomerular
formations in deeper layers as well (Fig. 3C). By plotting
the profile along the depth axis, it is clear that all olfactory
bulbs harbour the vast majority of their glomerular voxels
near the surface (Fig. 3D). Comparing the normal versus
Parkinson’s disease cases revealed a trend toward more in-
vasive glomeruli in Parkinson’s disease cases (Fig. 3E).

the depth of each glomerular voxel. The gradient extends from superficial (blue) to deep (red). The rendering of normal Case OFB48 (B) reveals
mostly blue and green voxels, indicating that the vast majority of glomerular voxels are near the surface. The high abundance of red voxels
in Parkinson’s disease Case PD50 (C) indicates that there are numerous glomerular voxels deep within the olfactory bulb. (D) Plots of the
abundance of glomerular voxels along the surface-to-core dimension. The y-axis is normalized to be proportional for each olfactory bulb, such
that the area below a curve amounts to 100% of the glomerular voxels for a given olfactory bulb. The x-axis is normalized to the distance from the
surface to the core along 10 bins. The core is defined as the point that is the furthest from all surfaces of the olfactory bulb. (E) The profiles in D
were averaged between the two categories of samples [normal versus Parkinson’s disease, (PD)] and plotted. Error bars are standard error of the
mean (SEM).

yrosine hydroxylase as a presumptive
marker for neuronal activation
TH immunoreactivity in the human olfactory bulb is re-
stricted to periglomerular neurons, which are dopaminergic
(Smith et al., 1991). In the mouse and rat olfactory bulb,
TH immunoreactivity in periglomerular neurons reflects
neuronal activation (Baker et al., 1983; Baker, 1990).
We labelled a subset of sections with antibodies against
TH. Throughout the olfactory bulb, TH + neurons labelled
brightly and surrounded glomeruli (Fig. 4A), as is typical
for activated glomeruli in rodents. The proportion of olfac-
tory bulb voxels that are TH + was on average 14-fold
higher in normal cases than in Parkinson’s disease cases

Figure 4 Olfactory bulb neurons immunoreactive for TH. (A) Immunofluorescence for TH shows robust staining along the glomerular
layer (area between dotted lines) from normal Case OFB43. Glomeruli with the appearance of tangles of axons (arrows) are often located in areas
corresponding to the external plexiform layer. (B) Clusters of glomeruli deep in the olfactory bulb from Parkinson’s disease Case PD42, well
beyond the glomerular layer, lack TH + neuronal somata in the vicinity of glomeruli (arrows). (C) TH + neuronal somata (arrows) from
Parkinson’s disease Case PD42 are occasionally present in the vicinity of invasive glomeruli. (D and E) Depth profiles comparing the distribution of
TH immunoreactive voxels versus that of glomerular voxels for six olfactory bulbs, three from normal cases (D) and three from Parkinson’s
disease cases (E). The majority of the TH immunoreactive signal is detected near the surface, with a similar distribution pattern as glomeruli.
Deep glomeruli also correlate with deeper TH profiles.

 (n = 3 cases each). In sharp contrast to the glomeruli located
superficially within the glomerular layer, the glomeruli
located deep within the bulb appeared to be mostly
devoid of TH + somata in their vicinity (Fig. 4B), further
differentiating them from the classical features of glomeruli
in rodents. There was TH immunoreactivity within and
around some deep glomeruli, reflecting most likely the den-
dritic processes of TH + neurons, and in rare instances
TH + somata (Fig. 4C). Indeed, when profiling for TH
immunoreactivity using a similar signal depth assay as
used on glomeruli, TH +
voxels exhibited distributions
across the 10 depth bins that mirror those of glomerular
voxels, both in normal cases (Fig. 4D) and in Parkinson’s
disease cases (Fig. 4E). The relationship between glomeru-
lar voxels and TH +
voxels was direct and significant
in all cases (Pearson correlation: Case OFB43, r = 0.9133,
P = 0.0002, R2 = 0.8341; Case OFB58, r = 0.8415, P =
0.0023, R2 = 0.7081; Case OFB59, r = 0.9182, P = 0.0002,
R2 = 0.8430; Case PD42, r = 0.9072, P = 0.0003, R2 =
0.8229; Case PD52, r = 0.8733, P = 0.0010, R2 = 0.7627;
Case PD53, r = 0.9623, P 5 0.0001, R2 = 0.9261). Thus, it
appears that deep glomeruli are innervated by TH + neu-
rons and may be activated by olfactory stimuli.
Global glomerular voxel volume
Next, we sought to define a parameter to quantify the
volume of all glomeruli and glomerular-like structures in a
human olfactory bulb. In a first set of experiments, we used
seven olfactory bulbs: four normal cases (Cases OFB41,
OFB42, OFB43, and OFB48) and three Parkinson’s disease
cases (Cases PD30, PD42, and PD50) (Table 1). After stain-
ing, scanning, and image processing, we examined the seg-
mentation manually to correct for false-positive or false-
negative segmentation resulting from staining irregularities.
These corrected datasets were reconstructed in 3D, enabling
the visualization of glomerular voxels (Fig. 5A and B). We
define the GGVV for a given olfactory bulb as the sum of
the volumes of all glomerular voxels. The range in GGVV
among these four normal cases was between 0.36 and 1.22
mm3. In contrast, the three Parkinson’s disease cases had a
GGVV between 0.20 and 0.42 mm3. Based on modelling
using datasets from the first set of experiments containing
every section spanning an olfactory bulb, the expected error
in determining GGVV at a sampling of one out of three
sections would be only �2%. Therefore, for the second
set of four olfactory bulbs (Cases OFB58, OFB59, PD52,
and PD53; Table 1), we processed every third section. By
quantifying the segmented glomerular voxels of both experi-
mental
series,
we
found
that
the
average
GGVV
of
Parkinson’s disease cases (0.395 � 0.248 mm3) is �47%
that of normal cases (0.840 � 0.35 mm3) (Fig. 5C).
Glomerular distribution in normal
and Parkinson’s disease cases
Next, we developed an automated analysis pipeline to
quantify the abundance of glomerular voxels in various
regions of the olfactory bulb. From the 3D reconstructions
we generated sets of virtual coronal sections that span the
entire anterior–posterior length of the olfactory bulb. We

 then divided each of these virtual sections into eight sectors
or octants, and quantified the abundance of glomerular
voxels in each sector (Fig. 6A). A graph plotting the
GGVV versus the percentage of glomerular voxels within

Figure 6 Distribution of glomerular voxels in normal and Parkinson’s disease cases. (A) Segmented 3D datasets of olfactory bulbs
were converted into virtual coronal sections. The coronal sections were subdivided into eight segments, and the fraction of glomerular voxels
within each segment was computed. The two groups (Parkinson’s disease and normal) show a differential distribution of glomeruli among these
octants (n = 11 olfactory bulbs). (B) Plotting the percentage of glomerular voxels in the ventral and dorsal halves of the olfactory bulb against the
GGVV shows significant differences between Parkinson’s disease cases (red) and normal cases (blue). (C) Density heat maps visualize the density
of glomerular voxels on the 3D reconstruction of an olfactory bulb, by pseudocolouring each glomerular voxel according to how many glomerular
voxels are found within a 300 -mm radius. Normal Case OFB48 is densely covered with glomerular voxels ventrally but has few glomerular voxels
dorsally. Parkinson’s disease Case PD50 has a few hotspots dorsally, and overall glomerular voxels are more evenly distributed compared to in
Case OFB48. Normal Case OFB43 has many glomerular voxels ventrally, but few on the sides and is less densely covered dorsally.

 normal cases. In normal cases, there is a ventral prepon-
derance of glomerular voxels, with 0.255 � 0.132 mm3
(�30%)
in
the
dorsal
half
and
0.585 � 0.249
mm3
(�70%) in the ventral half. But glomerular voxels in the
Parkinson’s disease cases are more evenly distributed along
the dorsal-ventral dimension, with the dorsal half contain-
ing 0.223 � 0.154 mm3 (�56%) of the glomerular voxels
and 0.172 � 0.094 mm3 (�44%) for the ventral half.
There is thus a glomerular voxel reduction of 0.032 mm3
(�13%) in the dorsal half, and of 0.413 mm3 (�71%) in
the ventral half.
Finally, we visualized the distribution of glomerular
voxels directly by applying a glomerular density heat
map. This visualization (Fig. 6C) pseudocolours each
glomerular voxel according to the number of glomerular
voxels located in a vicinity of 300 mm in any direction.
The olfactory bulbs of normal cases are exemplified by
Case OFB48: the ventral surface features glomerular
voxels densely and evenly, and the dorsal surface is
relatively devoid of glomerular voxels. Case PD50 has a
more even distribution of glomerular voxels in the dorsal
versus ventral aspect, with the dorsal surface hosting sev-
eral hotspots of high density. Case OFB43 also shows a
bias to the ventral surface in terms of glomerular voxel
density, but is comparable along the anterior–posterior
axis between the dorsal and ventral aspects. The coverage,
density,
and
distribution
of
glomerular
voxels
vary
greatly among cases with differing density, extent, and
patterning.
Staining of pSer129 a-synuclein in
olfactory bulbs of Parkinson’s disease
cases
To visualize aggregates in the form of Lewy bodies and
Lewy neurites, we performed immunohistochemistry for
a-synuclein phosphorylated at Ser129 (pSer129 a-synu-
clein),
a pathological hallmark
of Parkinson’s
disease
(Spillantini et al., 1997). We analysed four normal cases
(Cases OFB42, OFB48, OFB58, and OFB59) and four
Parkinson’s disease cases (Cases PD30, PD50, PD52, and
PD53). Because the normal cases were, as expected, virtu-
ally devoid of this pathological staining, we concentrated
our analyses on the Parkinson’s disease cases. We detected
prominent pSer129 a-synuclein staining throughout the ol-
factory bulb of these Parkinson’s disease cases (Fig. 7A).
The highest concentration of staining was found in the an-
terior olfactory nucleus, with Case PD52 exhibiting dense
Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in the anterior olfactory
nucleus (Fig. 7B). High magnification analysis revealed fre-
quent instances of what appear to be periglomerular neu-
rons exhibiting varying degrees of pSer129 a-synuclein
staining (Fig. 7C–I). We asked if a similar relationship as
we had observed between the depth profiles of TH + voxels
and glomerular voxels also existed for pSer129 a-synu-
clein + voxels and glomerular voxels. Here we masked
out the anterior olfactory nucleus because its pSer129
a-synuclein load would massively skew the comparison of
pSer129 a-synuclein + voxels versus glomerular voxels. We
thus restricted our analysis to the olfactory bulb minus the
anterior olfactory nucleus, with the posterior boundary
defined by the extent at which the last glomerulus could
be observed. Examining the plots of pSer129 a-synuclein +
voxels along the depth dimension (Fig. 7J), we observed a
significant direct correlation (Pearson correlation: Case
PD53, r = 0.6648, P = 0.0256, R2 = 0.4420; Case PD50,
r = 0.8295,
P = 0.0016,
R2 = 0.6881;
Case
PD30,
r =
0.7951,P = 0.0034,
R2 = 0.6321;
Case PD52, r = 0.6055,
P = 0.0484,
R2 = 0.3666).
Plotting
the
proportion
of
pSer129 a-synuclein+ voxels (the pSer129 a-synuclein load)
versus the GGVV showed an inverse correlation: the higher
the pSer129 a-synuclein load, the lower the GGVV, with a
coefficient of determination of R2 = 0.99935 to a logarithmic
relationship (Fig. 7K).
Discussion
Glomeruli in the olfactory bulb of
human versus mouse
Comparative analysis of the glomerular array in the olfac-
tory bulbs from normal and Parkinson’s disease cases re-
vealed a substantial degree of variability, as is true for most
qualitative and quantitative characteristics of olfactory
bulbs from normal cases. The gross morphology of the ol-
factory bulbs varied in shape and size, and an irregular
shape of the bulb was observed more consistently in
Parkinson’s disease cases. We confirm that the thousands
of glomeruli in the human olfactory bulb lack the orga-
nized,
uniform, and spherical
morphology typical
for
mouse glomeruli, but exhibit a broad range of shapes
and
sizes,
in
normal
and
Parkinson’s
disease
cases.
Obviously there are major differences between mouse and
human other than size, such as in genetic diversity, envir-
onment, lifestyle, and lifespan. Mouse studies are typically
done in mice of inbred strains; in mice that are born and
housed in ventilated cages; in mice that grow up and live in
specified pathogen-free conditions; in mice that are sub-
jected to a restricted and largely constant olfactory envir-
onment. Mice rarely get older than 2 years. In contrast,
humans are outbred; they are raised in the ‘wild’; they ex-
perience a much broader range of olfactory stimuli includ-
ing
noxious
stimuli
that
may
cause
cell
death
and
subsequent regeneration; and they suffer from numerous
episodes of rhinitis over their lifespan of 80 + years due
to the common cold. The human olfactory bulbs that are
donated for research purposes typically come from aged
individuals. The occurrence of invasive or atypical glomer-
uli in human olfactory bulbs is among the most pro-
nounced differences compared with the mouse, and has
been reported previously (Hoogland et al., 2003; Maresh

 et al., 2008). Such glomeruli may be a normal characteristic
of the human olfactory bulb throughout life, or the cumu-
lative result of insults and imperfections collected over a
lifetime of decades.
Global glomerular voxel volume
instead of counts of glomeruli
We believe that, for now, counts of glomeruli in human
olfactory bulbs are not so informative and may even be
misleading. First and foremost, it has proved difficult to
identify individual glomeruli unambiguously in sections or
in 3D reconstructions, given their irregular shapes and
sizes. Second, even if there were an objective method to
count glomeruli unambiguously and reproducibly, a basic
understanding of what a human olfactory bulb glomerulus
represents is still missing. It would be tempting to speculate
that, by analogy to mouse (Mombaerts et al., 1996; Treloar
et al., 2002), a human olfactory bulb glomerulus is formed
and exclusively innervated by the coalescence of axons
from OSNs expressing the same odorant receptor. But to
date there is no evidence for this fundamental organiza-
tional principle of wiring in human, or in non-human pri-
mates. With �400 odorant receptor genes in the human
genome (Malnic et al., 2004) and 2975 to 9325 glomeruli
in the human olfactory bulb (Maresh et al., 2008), the ratio
of two to three glomeruli per odorant receptor gene
observed in mouse does not extend to humans, where the
ratio is 7 to 23 (Maresh et al., 2008). This quantitative
difference of as much as one order of magnitude in ratio
between mouse and human may reflect a profound quali-
tative difference in wiring logic, which remains to be dis-
covered. It is within the realm of possibility that a human
olfactory bulb glomerulus is co-innervated by axons of
multiple populations of OSNs each expressing a different
odorant receptor or perhaps even multiple odorant recep-
tors. Conversely, a population of human OSNs expressing
a given odorant receptor may project their axons to mul-
tiple glomeruli. If the principle of homogeneity of glomeru-
lar innervation by OSN axons in terms of the expressed
odorant receptor (Treloar et al., 2002) holds true in
humans, the next question is then whether the multiple
glomeruli corresponding to a given odorant receptor are
clustered or scattered in the human olfactory bulb. Until
we understand what a human olfactory bulb glomerulus
represents, it is prudent not to rely on counts of glomeruli
for making inferences about mechanisms of olfactory
coding in normal cases and of olfactory dysfunction in
Parkinson’s disease. Moreover, mere counts of glomeruli
do not take into account their great variability in size.
Although we performed a software-based segmentation
to automatically identify glomeruli on the basis of con-
nected voxels, we refrained from counting glomeruli be-
cause our parameters affected the results of the counts.
Instead we defined a novel and objective parameter—glom-
erular voxels with a resolution of �10 mm3—and computed
the GGVV for a given olfactory bulb. When modelling
glomeruli as perfect spheres with a diameter of �60 mm,
the GGVVs that we calculated here translate into a pre-
dicted range from 1630 to 10 807 glomeruli, which over-
laps with the estimates of Maresh et al. (2008). We have
previously shown in gene-targeted mouse strains that the
total volume of the glomeruli corresponding to a given
odorant receptor correlates very well with the number of
OSNs that express this odorant receptor (Bressel et al.,
2016). If this finding translates to humans and remains
valid under pathological conditions, the GGVV would
serve as a surrogate marker for the number of OSNs that
project from the olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulb.
Parkinson’s disease as an a-synuclei-
nopathy in the olfactory bulb
A large body of literature has described Lewy pathology
and a-synucleinopathy in the human olfactory bulb (Daniel
and Hawkes, 1992; Rey et al., 2017). The classical Braak
staging of Parkinson’s disease posits that pathology initiates
in the olfactory bulb (Braak et al., 2003a, 2004). Olfactory
bulb a-synucleinopathy has a high specificity and sensitivity
for Lewy body disorders, and accurately predicts the pres-
ence of a-synucleinopathy in other brain regions (Beach
et al., 2009). This body of evidence is consistent with the
olfactory vector hypothesis, which has been proposed over
the years in various formulations (Braak et al., 2003b;
Hawkes et al., 2007; Doty, 2008; Rey et al., 2017).
We found that the GGVV of olfactory bulbs from
Parkinson’s disease cases is �47% that of normal cases.

Parkinson’s disease cases, and 7428 � 3096 for normal
cases. It remains to be seen whether this reduction in
GGVV reflects a reduced number of glomeruli, or a com-
bination of a decrease in glomerular size and a reduced
number of glomeruli. Arguably such a drastic reduction
in the glomerular component of the olfactory bulb could
in and of itself explain the olfactory dysfunction that is seen
in 490% of Parkinson’s disease patients (Doty, 2012).
We have shown that olfactory bulbs from Parkinson’s
disease cases with a higher a-synuclein load have a smaller
GGVV, suggesting a causal relationship between this load
and the reduction of the glomerular component of the
olfactory bulb. However, the accumulation of pSer129 a-
synuclein as Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites need not be
unequivocally pathogenic but can be protective (Parkkinen
et al., 2011). Alternatively, an aetiological factor causes
independently an aggregation of misfolded forms of a-synu-
clein (histologically detectable as Lewy bodies and Lewy
neurites) and a reduction of the GGVV (fewer glomeruli
and/or smaller glomeruli.)
We have documented a predominantly ventral deficit in
glomerular voxels in Parkinson’s disease cases: comparing

 the average distribution of glomerular voxels between
normal and Parkinson’s disease cases indicates a �13%
reduction in the dorsal aspect, and a �71% reduction ven-
trally. In a study by Sengoku et al. (2008), the localization
of pathological a-synuclein in Parkinson’s disease olfactory
bulbs was mostly peripheral in early stages, and also
became located in the anterior olfactory nucleus in later
stages. This shift from peripherally to centrally in the ol-
factory bulb with disease progression may reflect the direc-
tion of the spread of a-synucleinopathy, and is consistent
with the olfactory vector hypothesis. Likewise, the ventral
bias of the reduction in glomerular voxels could be inter-
preted as consistent with xenobiotics or other damaging
agents entering the olfactory bulb from the nasal cavity,
and causing fewer and/or smaller glomeruli in the region
of the olfactory bulb that is closest to the nasal cavity.
However, the disease duration in this set of Parkinson’s
disease cases ranged from 9 to 20 years (average 13.2
years), such that the pathology in the olfactory bulb
observed post-mortem may no longer reflect what occurred
in the early stages of the disease. In an alternative hypoth-
esis, fundamentally different populations of OSNs may
reside in the dorsal versus ventral regions of the human
olfactory epithelium, as is the case in mouse (Bozza et al.,
2009) and macaque (Horowitz et al., 2014), and project
their axons to dorsal or ventral aspects of the olfactory
bulb (Bozz et al., 2009). Insults to or loss of OSNs prefer-
entially in the ventral olfactory epithelium would then
result in a predominantly ventral deficit of the glomerular
component in the olfactory bulb of Parkinson’s disease
cases. Lewy body a-synucleinopathy has been documented
in the olfactory mucosa of patients with Parkinson’s disease
(Saito et al., 2016).
Conclusion
Here we have reported a rigorous, quantitative, voxel-
based approach to describe the glomerular component of
the human olfactory bulb in 3D reconstructions generated
from immunostained horizontal 10 mm section series. A dis-
tinct strength of our approach is that it encompasses the
whole olfactory bulb. We confirm and extend that the lam-
inar organization of the olfactory bulb is much less well
defined in humans compared to that of inbred laboratory
mice reared in controlled environments. We calculated that
olfactory bulbs from Parkinson’s disease cases contain ap-
proximately half as many glomerular voxels as normal
cases, suggesting fewer and/or smaller glomeruli. Instead
of the ventral preponderance of glomerular voxels in
normal cases, glomerular voxels are more evenly distribu-
ted along the dorsal-ventral dimension in Parkinson’s dis-
ease cases, indicating a predominantly ventral deficit. The
simplest interpretation of our observation of the higher the
a-synuclein load, the lower the GGVV, is a causal relation-
ship between a-synucleinopathy and reduction of the glom-
erular component of the olfactory bulb.
A look ahead
To make further progress in our mechanistic understanding
of olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson’s disease, the ques-
tions that beg answers are if a human olfactory bulb glom-
erulus is innervated homogeneously by axons of OSNs
expressing the same odorant receptor, and how the 7–23
glomeruli per human odorant receptor gene are distributed
in the olfactory bulb. The answers to these questions may
be provided by immunohistochemistry of human olfactory
bulb sections with antibodies against a human odorant
receptor that have been validated in mouse (Low and
Mombaerts, 2017). Next it will be critical to determine if
there are fundamental qualitative differences in the patterns
of OSN axonal innervation of glomeruli between normal
and Parkinson’s disease cases. Qualitative differences in the
wiring logic would help explain mechanistically the olfac-
tory dysfunction in Parkinson’s disease, in addition to the
quantitative difference: the predominantly ventral deficit in
the glomerular component of the olfactory bulb.
