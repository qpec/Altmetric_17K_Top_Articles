Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) were the most commonly 
used tobacco product among U.S. middle school and high 
school students in 2016 (1). CDC and the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) analyzed data from the 2016 National 
Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS) to assess self-reported reasons 
for e-cigarette use among U.S. middle school (grades 6–8) and 
high school (grades 9–12) student e-cigarette users. Among 
students who reported ever using e-cigarettes in 2016, the 
most commonly selected reasons for use were 1) use by “friend 
or family member” (39.0%); 2) availability of “flavors such as 
mint, candy, fruit, or chocolate” (31.0%); and 3) the belief 
that “they are less harmful than other forms of tobacco such 
as cigarettes” (17.1%). The least commonly selected reasons 
were 1) “they are easier to get than other tobacco products, 
such as cigarettes” (4.8%); 2) “they cost less than other 
tobacco products such as cigarettes” (3.2%); and 3) “famous 
people on TV or in movies use them” (1.5%). Availability 
of flavors as a reason for use was more commonly selected 
by high school users (32.3%) than by middle school users 
(26.8%). Efforts to prevent middle school and high school 
students from initiating the use of any tobacco product, 
including e-cigarettes, are important to reduce tobacco 
product use among U.S. youths (2).
NYTS is a school-based, pencil-and-paper questionnaire, 
self-administered to a cross-sectional, nationally representative 
sample of students in grades 6–12 in the United States (3). 
In 2016, 20,675 students completed the NYTS; the overall 
survey response rate was 71.6%. Reasons for e-cigarette use 
were assessed among both ever and current e-cigarette users. 
Ever users were defined as participants who responded “yes” 
to the question, “Have you ever used an electronic cigarette 
or e-cigarette, even once or twice?” Among ever users, current 
users were those who reported using e-cigarettes on ≥1 day 
during the past 30 days, based on responses to the question, 
“During the past 30 days, on how many days did you use elec-
tronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes?” Current e-cigarette users were 
further classified into four mutually exclusive group based on 
tobacco products used: e-cigarettes only; e-cigarettes and com-
bustible tobacco (e.g., cigarettes, cigars, pipes, bidis, or hoo-
kah); e-cigarettes and noncombustible tobacco (e.g., smokeless 
tobacco, snus, or dissolvable tobacco); and e-cigarettes with 
combustible and noncombustible tobacco. Data for the group 
that used e-cigarettes and noncombustible tobacco products 
are not presented because of small sample size.
Participants were asked, “What are the reasons why you have 
used electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes?” Response options 
were “I have never tried an electronic cigarette,” “friend or 
family member used them,” “to try to quit using tobacco 
products, such as cigarettes,” “they cost less than other tobacco 
products, such as cigarettes,” “they are easier to get than other 
tobacco products, such as cigarettes,” “famous people on TV 
or in movies use them,” “they are less harmful than other forms 
of tobacco, such as cigarettes,” “they are available in flavors, 
such as mint, candy, fruit, or chocolate,” “they can be used in 
areas where other tobacco products, such as cigarettes, are not 
allowed,” and “I used them for some other reason.” Participants 
could select multiple reasons.
After excluding participants who had never tried an e-cig-
arette or had missing information on school level (middle 
or high), sex, or race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic other race), 4,049 
ever users, including 1,281 current users, were included in 
the analysis. Data were weighted to account for the complex 
survey design and adjusted for nonresponse. Point estimates, 
95% confidence intervals, and population totals correspond-
ing to reasons for use were computed among ever and current 
e-cigarette users, both overall and by school level, sex, race/
ethnicity, and current use of other tobacco products. Chi-
square tests were used to assess statistically significant (p<0.05) 
differences across groups.
Among U.S. middle and high school e-cigarette ever users 
in 2016, the most commonly selected reasons for using e-cig-
arettes were “friend or family member used them” (39.0%), 
“they are available in flavors, such as mint, candy, fruit, or 
chocolate” (31.0%), and “they are less harmful than other 
forms of tobacco such as cigarettes” (17.1%). Reasons for use 
varied by school level and sex. For example, “friend or family 
member used them” was more commonly selected by middle 
school students (43.7%) than high school students (37.5%), 
and by females (46.7%) than males (32.2%) (Table 1). “They 
are available in flavors, such as mint, candy, fruit, or chocolate” 
was more commonly selected by high school students (32.3%) 
than by middle school students (26.8%). Among e-cigarette 
ever users, the least commonly selected reasons for use were

Among U.S. middle and high school students who 
reported using e-cigarettes (e-cigarettes only, e-cigarettes with 
combustible tobacco only, and e-cigarettes with combustible 
and noncombustible tobacco) during the past 30 days, the most 
commonly selected reasons for e-cigarette use were “they are 
available in flavors, such as mint, candy, fruit, or chocolate” 
(41.1%, 46.0%, and 29.1%, respectively), “friend or family 
member used them” (35.1%, 26.6%, and 20.2%, respectively),

and “they are less harmful than other forms of tobacco, such as 
cigarettes” (23.7%, 24.6%, and 22.8%, respectively) (Table 2).
Discussion
Among U.S. middle and high school students who had 
ever used e-cigarettes in 2016, the most commonly selected 
reasons for e-cigarette use were “friend or family member used 
them,” “they are available in flavors, such as mint, candy, fruit, 
or chocolate,” and “they are less harmful than other forms 
of tobacco, such as cigarettes.” Regardless of whether users 
reported using e-cigarettes exclusively or with other tobacco 
products during the past 30 days, these reasons remained the 
most commonly selected reasons for e-cigarette use. The avail-
ability of flavors, use by a friend or family member, and belief 
that e-cigarettes are less harmful than other forms of tobacco 
might be important factors for initiation or maintenance of 
e-cigarette use among middle school and high school students. 
Although percentages reported here are lower, the findings 
from this study are consistent with those of previous studies 
reporting that availability of flavors is among the most promi-
nently cited reasons for youths’ e-cigarette use (4,5).
The U.S. Surgeon General has concluded that e-cigarette 
use among youths and young adults is a public health concern 
(2). The prevalence of e-cigarette use among youths increased 
substantially during 2011–2015 (6,7). In 2016, e-cigarettes 
were the most common tobacco product used among ado-
lescents, although the overall prevalence of use declined from 
previous years (1,8). The Surgeon General has also concluded 
that e-cigarettes can contain harmful and potentially harmful 
constituents, including nicotine (2,8); exposure to nicotine 
during adolescence can cause addiction and can harm the 
developing adolescent brain (2,8). Recent research indicated 
that e-cigarette use declined among adolescent students in 
2016, likely in part because of population-based efforts to 
prevent youths’ e-cigarette initiation and use (1,9). Continued 
efforts are important to further reduce all forms of tobacco 
product use, including e-cigarettes, among U.S. youths. As 
noted by the Surgeon General, population-level strategies

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) were the most commonly 
used tobacco product among U.S. middle school and high 
school students in 2016. The Surgeon General concluded that 
e-cigarettes can contain harmful and potentially harmful 
constituents, including nicotine. Nicotine exposure during 
adolescence can cause addiction and can harm the developing 
adolescent brain.
What is added by this report?
Among student respondents to the National Youth Tobacco 
Survey reporting ever using e-cigarettes in 2016, the most 
commonly selected reasons for use were used by “friend or 
family member” (39%), availability of “flavors such as mint, 
candy, fruit, or chocolate” (31%), and the belief that “they are 
less harmful than other forms of tobacco such as cigarettes” 
(17%). The least commonly selected reasons were “they are 
easier to get than other tobacco products, such as cigarettes” 
(5%), “they cost less than other tobacco products such as 
cigarettes” (3%), and “famous people on TV or in movies use 
them” (2%). 
What are the implications for public health practice?
Efforts to prevent middle school and high school students from 
initiating the use of any tobacco product, including e-cigarettes, 
are important to reduce tobacco product use among U.S. 
youths. Regulation of the manufacturing, distribution, and 
marketing of tobacco products by the Food and Drug 
Administration, along with sustained implementation of 
comprehensive tobacco control and prevention strategies, 
could reduce e-cigarette use and initiation by middle school 
and high school students.
include incorporating e-cigarettes into smoke-free indoor 
air policies, restricting youths’ access to e-cigarettes in retail 
settings, licensing retailers, and establishing specific package 
requirements (2).
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limi-
tations. First, because only students from public and private 
schools in the United States are recruited in the NYTS, the 
findings might not be generalizable to youths who are home-
schooled, in detention centers, or have dropped out of school. 
Second, selected reasons for ever use of e-cigarettes might 
not necessarily be consistent with actual reasons for use in 
the 30 days before the survey. Third, self-reported data are 
subject to underreporting and recall bias (10). Fourth, only 
predetermined potential reasons were assessed, rather than 
participant-generated reasons for use. For example, 31.6% 
of ever users indicated “I used them for some other reason.” 
Thus, the importance of these reasons relative to other potential 
explanations cannot be assessed. Finally, the use of a response 
list, even with “select all that apply” available, might lead to 
underselection of other relevant reasons.
Comprehensive strategies to prevent and reduce the use of all 
tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, among U.S. youths 
are warranted (2). Regulation of the manufacturing, distribu-
tion, and marketing of tobacco products by FDA,* along with 
sustained implementation of comprehensive tobacco control 
and prevention strategies, could reduce youths’ e-cigarette 
initiation and use (2,7). In addition, continued monitoring of 
e-cigarette use, including reasons for use and product charac-
teristics, is important to guide strategies to prevent and reduce 
use of e-cigarettes among youths.
