Background
Colorectal cancer is the fourth commonest cancer in the 
UK with 41,265 new cases in 2014, representing 11% of 
all new cancer [1]. Incidence is strongly related to age, 
with 72% of cases (2012–2014) occurring in those older 
than 65 years [2]. Five- 
year survival is heavily influenced 
by stage at diagnosis, and is over 95% at stage I but less 
than 8% at stage 4 [3]. Because the symptoms develop 
insidiously, a high proportion of patients are diagnosed 
at a stage beyond surgical cure.
Most cases develop slowly over a number of years from 
benign adenomatous polyps which transform to malignant 
adenocarcinomas. The identification of the early stages 
offers the opportunity to improve outcomes through sur-
gical excision [4]. Adenomas and adenocarcinomas may 
bleed to a level unnoticed by the individual, enabling 
detection through fecal occult blood testing (FOBt), and 
this has become the standard screening approach in the 
UK [5]. A meta- 
analysis published in 2007 found a 16% 
reduction in colorectal cancer- 
specific mortality associated 
with FOBt screening (odds ratio 0.84, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.89) 
[6]. All countries in the UK now offer FOBt for some 
age ranges of the older population, at two yearly intervals. 
However, uptake of screening invitations was only 57% 
in randomized trials, and a pilot study of the FOBt in

Abstract
Earlier detection of colorectal cancer greatly improves prognosis, largely through 
surgical excision of neoplastic polyps. These include benign adenomas which 
can transform over time to malignant adenocarcinomas. This progression may 
be associated with changes in full blood count indices. An existing risk algorithm 
derived in Israel stratifies individuals according to colorectal cancer risk using 
full blood count data, but has not been validated in the UK. We undertook a 
retrospective analysis using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Patients aged 
over 40 with full blood count data were risk- 
stratified and followed up for a 
diagnosis of colorectal cancer over a range of time intervals. The primary out-
come was the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the 
18–24- 
month interval. We also undertook a case–control analysis (matching for 
age, sex, and year of risk score), and a cohort study of patients undergoing full 
blood count testing during 2012, to estimate predictive values. We included 
2,550,119 patients. The area under the curve for the 18–24- 
month interval was 
0.776 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.771, 0.781]. Performance improves as 
the time interval reduces. The area under the curve for the age- 
matched case–
control analysis was 0.583 [0.574, 0.591]. For the population risk- 
scored in 
2012, the positive predictive value at 99.5% specificity was 8.8% with negative 
predictive value 99.6%. The algorithm offers an additional means of identifying 
risk of colorectal cancer, and could support other approaches to early detection, 
including screening and active case finding.

A Prediction Model for Colorectal Cancer
England reported a 59% response [7]. These rates are 
clearly suboptimal and additional approaches might facili-
tate early detection in a greater proportion of the 
population.
Routinely collected primary care data have been used 
to develop a range of algorithms for identifying individu-
als at risk of various types of cancers [8, 9], including 
colorectal [10–12]. These algorithms use the presence of 
symptoms recorded in primary care to identify individuals 
with a high risk of being later diagnosed. The limitation 
is that patients so identified already have established symp-
toms noticeable enough to report to a doctor, and are 
therefore at a relatively late stage.
Medial EarlySign, Israel, is developing a range of machine 
learning algorithmic tools to identify high- 
risk patients in 
various settings (diabetes control, cardiovascular procedures, 
birth- 
related complications, deterioration in intensive care 
units, cancer screening, genetic screening). The algorithms 
are developed by analyzing large complex datasets of mil-
lions of patients. Recently, their group reported a study 
on an Israeli population of two million patients [13]. They 
analyzed primary care electronic health record data to 
identify individuals diagnosed with colorectal cancer. A 
machine learning process derived a prediction algorithm 
based on a random forest model. Variables included age, 
sex, and full blood count (FBC) results, which are com-
monly found in primary care health records. The rationale 
is that patients may develop subtle changes in FBC indices 
at a relatively early stage, prior to the development of 
overt symptoms. This may enable earlier detection than 
is possible through the symptom- 
based approach, and prior 
to the onset of anemia. Hamilton et al. demonstrated that 
anemia evident in full blood count data from UK primary 
care predicts colorectal cancer risk, and that iron deficiency, 
which may predate established anemia, is an independent 
risk factor [14]. Signs of iron deficiency may develop in 
full blood count profiles despite hemoglobin remaining in 
the reference range. If more than one FBC result is avail-
able, the algorithm can detect changes in the values of 
the indices, identifying a problem even before they are 
out of their reference ranges. Such changes are unlikely 
to be noticed by a clinician examining FBC reports, which 
may be filed unseen if all indices are in range.
The Israeli model was trained on a derivation dataset 
and then tested on validation datasets, one from the same 
source, the other from a sample of UK data from The 
Health Improvement Network (THIN) [13]. Several meas-
ures were used to evaluate performance, including the 
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, or 
“area under the curve” (AUC), and statistics related to 
the AUC, where the threshold of the risk score was set 
to specific values of sensitivity (50%) and specificity 
(99.5%). The algorithm’s performance was assessed at 
different time intervals up to 24 months before the diag-
nosis on individuals aged 50–75 years. For the interval 
3–6 months before diagnosis, the specificity was 88(± 2)% 
at a sensitivity of 50% and the AUC was 0.82. A sensitiv-
ity of 50% is similar to that offered by FOBt, that is, 
50% of cancers will give a positive result [15].
The aim of this current study is to evaluate this risk 
algorithm independently using Clinical Practice Research 
Datalink (CPRD) data from the UK.
Methods
Study design, source of data, and study 
population
We undertook a retrospective analysis, following the methods 
described in Kinar et al., in a population of patients from 
the CPRD, a large database linked to anonymized patient- 
level data from over 600 UK general practices. Study par-
ticipants were those registered on the database between 01 
January 2000 and 28 April 2015. The end date was the 
date of the most recent update of the CPRD dataset, which 
may differ between contributing practices. All patients 
included in the study had at least one FBC present in the 
record. Entry to the cohort was at the index date, which 
is defined as the latest of start date, the 40th birthday, or 
date of registration with the general practice.
We excluded the following groups:
• Less than 12 months registered with the general practice
• Less than 2 years of follow-up data following the index 
date
• History of colorectal cancer before the index date
• Colorectal 
cancer 
precursors 
(e.g., 
adenomatous 
polyps)
• Hemoglobin gene defects (thalassemia, sickle cell 
disorders)
We included all other patient records, to maximize the 
precision of our estimates.
Study outcome
The primary endpoint is a first diagnosis of colorectal 
cancer in the primary care record. Patients with no diag-
nosis were censored at the earliest date of: date of death, 
the end date or date of leaving the general practice.
Predictors
We extracted the year of birth and sex of each participant, 
every FBC, each of which could have a maximum of 20 
indices, and the date of each FBC.

A Prediction Model for Colorectal Cancer
J. Birks et al.
Statistical methods
The calculation of the risk score uses the patient identity 
code, year of birth, sex, and date of FBC. The algorithm 
requires up to 20 indices of a single FBC, which are 
imputed if missing. Previous values for the FBC indices 
are utilized if available but only one FBC is required to 
generate a risk score. Input files were prepared by the 
Oxford team, excluding the outcome data. A representa-
tive from the Medial team ran the algorithm and returned 
a dataset containing a score, between 0 and 100, for 
every FBC considered valid according to their criteria, 
together with the date of the FBC and the patient identity 
code.
For the primary analysis, we followed the methods 
outlined in the paper reporting the original derivation 
and validation of the score by Kinar et al. We identified 
the FBCs at least 18 months prior to the end date for 
those with no diagnosis (noncases) of colorectal cancer. 
For each patient, one FBC and associated score was ran-
domly selected using a computer algorithm. For those 
with a diagnosis (cases), all FBCs within 18–24 months 
prior to date of diagnosis were identified. If a patient 
had more than one FBC within the time period, one 
FBC was randomly selected using a computer algorithm. 
Logistic regression analysis was performed with the score 
as the only predictor in the model. To evaluate the per-
formance of the model, the receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curve was plotted and the area under the curve 
(AUC) calculated (C- 
statistic). To provide statistics which 
could be compared to those reported by Kinar et al., the 
specificity was calculated when sensitivity was 50%, and 
sensitivity calculated when specificity was 99.5%.
In contrast to the Kinar et al. study, whose primary 
analysis was based on the 3–6- 
month time interval prior 
to diagnosis, we chose 18–24 months for our primary 
analysis. This was because the opportunity to modify 
prognosis requires an adequate time interval for interven-
tion. For our secondary analyses, the performance of the 
algorithm was measured at 3–6, 6–12, 12–18, and 
24–36 months before diagnosis using the same method.
Sensitivity analyses
To test whether the outcomes were robust to variation 
in the randomly selected FBCs, the analysis was repeated 
10 times, resampling the dataset using a different seed 
code.
As a further sensitivity analysis, a case–control study 
was designed by matching cases and noncases by sex, 
year of birth, and year of selected FBC. This was under-
taken because of the (expected) difference in the age 
distributions of the cases and noncases populations.
For those with no diagnosis (noncases) we identified 
the FBCs at least 18 months prior to the end date. For 
those 
with 
a 
diagnosis 
(cases), 
all 
FBCs 
within 
18–24 months prior to date of diagnosis were identified. 
If a patient, cases and noncases, had more than one FBC 
within the time period, one FBC was randomly selected. 
For each case 100 noncases were selected matching for 
sex, age at time of FBC, and year of risk score. Logistic 
regression analysis was performed with the score as the 
only predictor in the model. The AUC for the receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated 
(C- 
statistic).
Calculation of predictive values
For the analyses set out above, estimation of predictive 
values (PPV, NPV) is not appropriate, as there is no defined 
population to which they would be applicable. It is pos-
sible to define a cohort of patients at the start date of the 
study, 01 January 2000, but the concept of a well- 
defined 
cohort is lost as each patient contributes data at a date 
set by the randomly selected score. To investigate the result 
of applying the score to a defined cohort of patients pre-
senting in primary care, we followed until end date all 
patients with a FBC and score in 2012 who had not previ-
ously been diagnosed with colorectal cancer. The year 2012 
was chosen as this was the most recent year for which 
24 months of follow- 
up were available.
All patients were followed until they were either diag-
nosed with colorectal cancer or censored at end date. We 
conducted a logistic regression analysis with a diagnosis 
within 24 months as the outcome and the risk score as 
predictor. Patients who were censored within 2 years of 
the score in 2012, either because they had died without 
a diagnosis or were lost to follow- 
up, were omitted from 
the analysis. The AUC for the ROC curve was calculated 
(C- 
statistic). We also calculated values for specificity when 
sensitivity was 50%, sensitivity when specificity was 99.5%, 
positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive 
value (NPV).
We could not assess agreement between observed out-
comes and predicted outcomes, that is calibration, as the 
risk score does not provide a measure of absolute risk.
The project was approved by the Independent Scientific 
Advisory 
Committee 
(ISAC) 
for 
CPRD 
(protocol 
14_195RMn) and the protocol was made available to the 
reviewers.

of neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and 
lymphocytes (components of white blood cells) were 
recorded for only 10% of FBCs but these can be derived 
from the cell counts. The mean cell volume, mean cell 
hemoglobin and mean cell hemoglobin concentration can 
also be derived from values of other indices. This increased 
the mean number of indices available to 15.6. Those most 
frequently missing were mean platelet volume (present 
in 14% of FBCs) and red cell distribution width (present 
in 2% of FBCs). The Table S1 gives the proportions of 
missing data for each FBC parameter.
Data were excluded when more than one FBC belong-
ing to an individual patient was associated with a single 
date or when hemoglobin was missing from the FBC. A 
total of 364,470 patients were excluded as they had insuf-
ficient FBC indices to generate a score. The total number 
of patient years of data from the remaining 2,550,119 
patients was 27,949,304 indicating that the average time 
in the study was 11.0 years. The mean age at the start 
date was 54.2 years, and 55.4% of the patients were female.
For the included patients, we identified 25,430 with an 
incident diagnosis of colorectal cancer. We excluded 68 
patients whose age at diagnosis was less than 40 years. 
The mean age of diagnosis was 71.2 years. 20,492 cases 
had at least one FBC before diagnosis. The time of the 
closest FBC to diagnosis varied between 0 and 5580 days. 
A total of 7634 cases had a FBC within 2 years before 
diagnosis.
Primary analysis
We identified 2,220,108 patients without a diagnosis who 
had at least one FBC and related score at least 18 months 
before end date, and 5141 patients with a diagnosis who 
had at least one FBC and related score within the time 
window of 18 to 24 months before diagnosis. For each 
patient that met the inclusion criteria, one FBC and asso-
ciated score was randomly selected. The mean age (standard 
deviation) of those without a diagnosis was 60.5 years 
(14.0) and of those with a diagnosis, 72.7 years (10.5). 
The mean age at time of the FBC and the mean score 
by sex and colorectal cancer diagnosis are reported in 
Table 1.
The results of the logistic regression analysis with the 
score as the only predictor are reported in Table 2 (shaded 
row). The ROC curve is shown in Figure 1 and gives an 
AUC of 0.776 [95% CI: 0.771, 0.781].
Secondary analyses
Table 2 also gives the results of repeating the analysis 
with different time windows. The closer to the diagnosis, 
the greater become the sensitivity, specificity, and AUC 
values.
Sensitivity analyses
The resampling exercise confirmed that the analyses were 
robust to variation in the randomly selected seed codes. 
The primary outcome AUC gave a narrow range of values 
in the 10 samples (0.7755 to 0.7765) around a mean of 
0.7760. The risk score cut off associated with 99.5% speci-
ficity was identical (99.78) for all ten.
Tables 3 reports the results of the case–control study 
matching cases and noncases by sex, year of birth, and 
year of selected FBC. The AUC was 0.583 [0.574, 0.591].
For the estimation of predictive values, we identified 
797,119 patients with a score measured in 2012, and with 
no diagnosis of colorectal cancer at the time of this score. 
Male and female patients were pooled, age range 40- 
108 years. Patients without 2 years of follow- 
up from 
score were excluded. Within 2 years 36,032 (4.5%) of 
the patients had died and 160,814 (20%) were lost to 
follow- 
up. The mean age and score of these groups are 
reported in Table 4. The analysis dataset consists of the 
patients with a diagnosis within 2 years of the score, 
2454 patients, and those with 2 years of follow- 
up without 
a diagnosis (594,926 patients). The results of the logistic 
regression analysis with the score as the only predictor 
are reported in Table 5.
Assuming that the patients included in the analysis 
reported in Table 4 represent a defined cohort of patients, 
the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive 
value (NPV) were estimated using a cut off for the score 
of 99.84 (associated with 99.5% specificity). The PPV was 
8.8% with NPV 99.6%. At this cut off, the odds ratio

for a diagnosis of colorectal cancer was 26.5 (95% CI: 
23.3, 30.2). This figure is very similar to the value reported 
by Kinar et al.
Discussion
Summary of main findings
The risk score applied to routinely collected primary care 
data from the UK produced AUC values comparable with 
those from the Israeli population used to derive it. Our 
primary outcome interval (18–24 months) produced an 
AUC of 0.776. This interval was chosen as it provides a 
greater opportunity to intervene and modify prognosis 
than the 3–6- 
month interval chosen by Kinar et al. for 
their primary analysis, whose AUC was 0.82. In our study, 
this shorter time interval gave a very similar value of 
0.84, validating the risk algorithm performance in the 
UK. Most of the predictive power is due to age, as is 
evidenced by the reduction in AUC to 0.583 in the case–
control sensitivity analysis, which removes the age com-
ponent through age matching. However, age is indeed a 
useful factor in determining colorectal cancer risk, and 
the addition of FBC indices to age and sex improves the 
ability to identify patients at risk.

A Prediction Model for Colorectal Cancer
Limitations of the study
After removing our excluded groups, our primary analysis 
only included 5141 of 25,430 colorectal cancer patients 
in the dataset. The FBC data from the Israeli population 
consist of more indices than are found in the UK CPRD 
data. Patients in Israel have full blood counts taken rou-
tinely as part of regular health checks, while in the UK, 
the test is usually conducted for some clinical reason. 
The fact that a blood test has been requested therefore 
carries some predictive weight itself in the UK setting, 
although FBCs are requested for a wide variety of reasons, 
most unrelated to colorectal cancer, and our results were 
similar to those found by Kinar et al. in the Israeli 
setting.
Other known risk factors for colorectal cancer, such 
as family history and microsatellite instability (MSI) status 
are not included in this approach. MSI status is not usu-
ally available in the primary care setting, and family his-
tory is recorded inconsistently. One of the advantages of 
this risk algorithm is that provided an individual has had 
a full blood count taken, the values of all the indices 
should be available, with very little missing data.
Absolute risk is assumed to be a monotonic function 
of risk score, but the form of the function is unknown. 
Discrimination can be investigated using sensitivity, speci-
ficity, and the area under the ROC curve, but we cannot 
easily quantify how close the predictions of risk are to 
actual risk.
The outcomes recorded in CPRD and used in this study 
are incident diagnoses of colorectal cancer following the 
risk estimation, which is different from the prevalence of 
undiagnosed cancer in those identified. This prevalence 
could only be measured through a study using the gold 
standard on the population at risk. Some of the individu-
als with no diagnosis during our study may be diagnosed 
after a longer time interval than we were able to 
follow- 
up. The detection of precancerous lesions is also 
very useful clinically as it enables prevention of future 
cancer and this outcome was not included in this study.
Comparison with other literature
Our analysis was designed to validate independently the 
results obtained by Kinar et al. Following their method, 
we have reported values for risk score cut offs correspond-
ing to a sensitivity of 50% (≥83.47) and for a specificity 
of 99.5% (≥99.78). Kinar et al. undertook further analyses 
based on stage of cancer diagnoses. These were not avail-
able for our analyses in CPRD but we intend to carry 
out further analyses through linkage to the Cancer Registry. 
Kinar et al. derived measures of absolute risk for patients 
identified, but for our study these were not available. We 
attempted this through a sensitivity analysis and derived 
an estimate of the PPV of 8.8% for the high- 
risk score 
cut off. However, identifying a meaningful “cohort” popu-
lation 
in 
retrospective 
studies 
such 
as 
these 
is 
problematic.
Comparing our results with those of Hippisley- 
Cox 
and Coupland [10], a study independently validated by 
Collins and Altman [12], we have derived comparable 
(although slightly lower) measures of discrimination for 
the Israeli algorithm. The Hippisley- 
Cox and Coupland 
study included a number of predictive factors including 
symptoms recorded in primary care electronic records. 
A record of anemia was also included, but not FBC 
indices. We are unable to confirm through this present 
study our underlying premise that the Israeli risk score 
can identify cases at an earlier cancer stage than approaches 
based on symptoms. However, in terms of absolute risk, 
our estimated PPV for the highest risk groups (8.8%) 
is higher than the observed risk associated with Hippisley- 
Cox and Coupland’s upper 1% of predicted risk (5.2%).

Clinical interpretation
Application of the Medial algorithm to routinely collected 
primary care data offers a potential additional means of 
identifying those at risk of colorectal cancer. For a patient 
with a risk score value associated with 99.5% specificity, 
we estimate a risk of being diagnosed over the next 2 years 
of 8.8%. This outcome does not include additional patients 
who have a precursor lesion (adenoma), who will also 
benefit from early recognition.
As expected, there is a trade- 
off between algorithmic 
performance (increasing as the interval to diagnosis 
reduces) and opportunity to intervene (increasing as the 
interval increases). Confirming the diagnosis in an indi-
vidual found to be at risk usually involves invasive pro-
cedures such as colonoscopy, which is not itself without 
risk although serious complications are rare [16]. The 
PPV value we have derived for the high- 
risk score values 
is significantly higher than the 3% recommended by the 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence as a 
threshold for fast- 
track cancer referrals in the UK [17]. 
However, given the limitations in deriving measures of 
absolute risk in retrospective cohort studies, this finding 
needs to be confirmed prospectively through further 
research. It is also unclear whether the individuals identi-
fied with the high scores already have symptoms justifying 
investigation, or whether these patients are indeed being 
identified at an earlier, perhaps presymptomatic phase in 
the cancer process. Even where those identified are already 
symptomatic, their identification through use of the algo-
rithm might still bring the (already justified) investigations 
forward. Failure to recognize and refer symptomatic indi-
viduals to exclude bowel cancer is part of the problem 
of late detection [18].
These findings may provide a role for the risk score 
as a tool to assist case finding in a range of settings. 
The score could be applied to primary care electronic 
health records and be automatically updated each time 
a FBC result appeared in the record. Patients with high 
(or increasing) values could be identified and considered 
for investigation. However, this high specificity approach 
will inevitably be limited in its ability to capture cases. 
At the less extreme cut off values, where sensitivity is 
higher, the algorithm could also help target those who 
do not take up the invitations for FOBt or who refuse 
colonoscopy 
when 
offered 
through 
the 
screening 
program.
Our results need to be followed up through further 
research investigating the utility of the risk algorithm 
embedded in the routine care setting, to optimize the 
early detection of colorectal cancer and improve health 
outcomes. This would involve measuring the risk scores 
of a greater proportion of the at risk population, and 
investigating pragmatically the additional benefit offered 
to early detection of bowel cancer.
