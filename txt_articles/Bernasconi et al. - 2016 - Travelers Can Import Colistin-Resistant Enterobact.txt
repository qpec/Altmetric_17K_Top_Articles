Stool samples from 38 travelers returning from India were screened for extended-spectrum cephalosporin- and carbapenem-
resistant Enterobacteriaceae implementing standard selective plates. Twenty-six (76.3%) people were colonized with CTX-M or
DHA producers, but none of the strains was colistin resistant and/or mcr-1 positive. Nevertheless, using overnight enrichment
and CHROMagar Orientation plates supplemented with colistin, four people (10.5%) were found to be colonized with colistin-
resistant Escherichia coli. One cephalosporin-susceptible sequence type 10 (ST10) strain carried a 4,211-bp ISApl1-mcr-1-ISApl1
element in an IncHI2 plasmid backbone.
T
he emergence of colistin-resistant (COL-R-Ent) Enterobacte-
riaceae harboring the plasmid-mediated mcr-1 gene has raised
serious concerns (1, 2). These strains (especially Escherichia coli)
have been isolated worldwide from humans (1, 3–10), food-pro-
ducing animals (4, 6, 11–14), the food chain (7, 10, 15–17), and
the environment (4, 15). However, most of these studies searched
for mcr-1 in previously stored extended-spectrum cephalosporin-
resistant Enterobacteriaceae (ESC-R-Ent) (8, 12, 13, 15, 17). This
leads to a question about the actual prevalence of mcr-1-positive
Enterobacteriaceae (mcr-1-Ent), especially because mcr-1 can be
carried by plasmids not coharboring extended-spectrum �-lacta-
mase (ESBL), plasmid-mediated AmpC (pAmpCs), and/or car-
bapenemase genes (5, 7, 12, 14, 18). Moreover, although it is
known that the prevalence of intestinal colonization with ESC-R-
Ent in returning travelers is very high (19), data regarding the
mcr-1-Ent are needed. Only Arcilla et al. have explored this phe-
nomenon, indicating that 0.9% of the ESBL producers isolated
from stools of Dutch travelers co-possessed mcr-1 (8).
We analyzed the pre- and posttrip stool samples (both within 1
week) of 38 people living in Switzerland and traveling to India
during January to August 2015. A questionnaire was also filled out
at each sampling time indicating that in the 12 months before
going to India, participants frequently visited other countries but
never suffered diarrhea. On the other hand, after the journey to
India (mean stay, 17.8 days), 39% of the travelers suffered from
travelers’ diarrhea and additional symptoms, although antibiotics
were not taken (see Table S1 in the supplemental material).
To detect ESC-R-Ent, �20 �g of fresh stools was enriched
overnight in 10 ml LB broth containing a 10-�g disk of cefu-
roxime. Then, 100 �l was plated on BLSE, ChromID ESBL
(bioMérieux), and Supercarba selective plates (20). After over-
night incubation, colonies were identified using the matrix-as-
sisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrome-
try (MALDI-TOF MS) (Bruker). Microdilution GNX2F panels
(Trek Diagnostics) were used to obtain the antibiotic MICs.
The CT103XL microarray was used to detect bla genes. Multilocus
sequence typing (MLST) for E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae
(Warwick and Pasteur schemes, respectively) was used to deter-
mine the sequence type (ST); the E. coli phylogenetic group was
also determined (21). The remaining stool samples were stored at
�80°C without cryoprotectant.
Based on this initial screening, three (7.9%) people had stool
samples positive for ESBL-producing E. coli before traveling,
whereas 29 (76.3%) of them returned from India colonized with
ESC-R-Ent, such as 26 CTX-M- and 3 DHA-producing E. coli. No
carbapenemase producers were detected (Table 1). Overall, E. coli
strains found in returning travelers were of non-hyperepidemic
STs and were mainly of phylogenetic groups A1 (n � 11) and B1
(n � 8). Notably, all of these ESC-R-Ent had polymyxin MICs of
�0.5 �g/ml and did not contain mcr-1 as determined by PCR (1).
To improve our ability to detect possible Col-R-Ent (including
those non-ESC-R), stored stools were enriched in 10 ml LB broth
with two 10-�g disks of colistin. After overnight incubation, 100
�l was spread on four agar plates: MacConkey agar without or
with colistin (4 �g/ml) and CHROMagar Orientation plus colistin
(4 �g/ml) and vancomycin (8 �g/ml) without or with cefotaxime
(2 �g/ml). MacConkey plates yielded numerous undistinguish-
able colonies of species naturally resistant to polymyxins (e.g.,
Proteus spp. and Serratia marcescens). In contrast, thanks to the
typical color appearance of the different Gram-negative organ-
isms, the CHROMagar Orientation plates allowed us to clearly
identify Col-R E. coli (Col-R-Ec) colonies.

Downloaded from 
 person was colonized with a Col-R-Ec strain before traveling,
whereas four (10.5%) returning travelers had stools positive for
Col-R-Ec (of which three coproduced ESBLs or pAmpCs). Re-
markably, two (26-Ec and 100R-Ec) out of the overall five Col-
R-Ec strains were non-ESC-R (see Table S2 in the supplemental
material) and were identified only with the CHROMagar Orien-
tation plates containing colistin but not cefotaxime. Notably,
Col-R Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes,
and Salmonella species strains were not found (2, 22). We cannot
exclude that storing the stools at �80°C could influence the via-
bility of Col-R strains.
Overall, one (2.6%) ST10/A1 E. coli strain (100R-Ec) was PCR
positive for mcr-1 (Table 1). This strain had a colistin MIC of 12
�g/ml by Etest and was coresistant to quinolones, trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole, and tetracyclines (see Table S2 in the supple-
mental material). The strain carried HI2, FII, FIB, and X1 plasmid
replicon types (PBRT kit; Diatheva). Experiments with transfor-
mation into chemically competent DH5� E. coli failed to obtain
mcr-1-carrying cells (23). Conjugation experiments using E. coli
recipient strain JF33 (rifampin resistant) performed at 25 and
37°C and with selection on MacConkey plates containing colistin
(2 �g/ml) and rifampin (50 �g/ml) were also unsuccessful.
To complete the bacterial typing of the mcr-1-positive strain
and to identify the resistome and mobilome, raw genome
data (MiSeq; Illumina) were screened by ResFinder-2.1 and
PlasmidFinder-1.3 (24, 25). 100R-Ec carried resistance genes
for aminoglycosides [aadA1, aadA2, and aph(3=)-Ia], �-lactams
(blaTEM-1), polymyxins (mcr-1), quinolones (qnrS1), macrolides
[mph(A)], phenicols (cmlA1), sulfonamides (sul3), tetracyclines
[tet(A)], and trimethoprim (dfrA12 and dfrA14).
By PlasmidFinder, the presence of IncF, IncX1, and IncHI2
plasmids was confirmed in the 100R-Ec strain. The mcr-1 gene was
identified at the end of a 26-kb contig (GenBank accession no.
KX090925), flanked by two copies of ISApl1 in the opposite ori-
entation forming a 4,211-bp ISApl1-mcr-1-ISApl1 element. The
22,133-bp sequences preceding the ISApl1-mcr-1-ISApl1 element
shared �99% identity with DNA sequences of large IncHI2 plas-
mids, such as pKST313 from Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi-
murium (GenBank accession no. LN794248), pAPEC-O1-R from
avian-pathogenic E. coli (GenBank accession no. DQ517526) (26,
27), and pSA26 carrying ISApl1-mcr-1 from an ST68 E. coli strain
(GenBank accession no. KU743384). The mcr-1 element was in-
serted into the tra1 locus of the IncHI2 plasmid backbone imme-
diately downstream of the conjugative protein gene trhY. The dis-
ruption of the tra region may explain the defective conjugation
ability of this plasmid. Notably, the presence of mcr-1 between
duplicated ISApl1 insertion elements has so far only been ob-
served in one human KPC-2-producing E. coli isolate in Germany
and two IncHI2 plasmids isolated in the United Kingdom (4, 10).
Taking into account that 100R-Ec was of ST10/A1, and due to
the high identity of the mcr-1-containing element with plasmids
found in bacteria from animal origin, we speculate that this Col-R
E. coli strain was acquired during the trip in India via the food
chain or from environmental sources. Remarkably, the traveler
was cocolonized with an ST155 CTX-M-producing E. coli strain
(100R-Ec-Drig). A follow-up screening of the stool samples 3 and
6 months after returning from the trip indicated that the person
was no longer colonized with both E. coli strains.
The remaining mcr-1-negative but Col-R E. coli strains (26-Ec,
78R-Ec, 86R-Ec, and 88R-Ec) underwent conjugation experi-

Downloaded from 
 ments, but all failed to demonstrate a hypothetical plasmid-medi-
ated mechanism of colistin resistance. We should note that such
strains have been previously observed in humans and animals (8,
9, 28) and that they are Col-R, probably due to chromosomal
mutations (10, 29). Notably, the stool samples from three of the
travelers mentioned above were negative for Col-R Ent at the 3-
and 6-month follow-up screenings. (ID-78 did not submit the
stool samples for screening.) The risk factors determining the in-
testinal colonization with Col-R-Ec of people visiting India are
unclear and should be investigated in the near future.
Our results indicate that the prevalence of intestinal mcr-1-Ent
is probably underestimated because some isolates carrying only
mcr-1 (like 100R-Ec) could be routinely undetected when the
screening is targeting the ESC-R and/or carbapenem-resistant
strains (5, 7, 8, 12, 14, 18). It is possible that the ISApl1-mcr-1-
ISApl1 element present in 100R-Ec possesses the ability to trans-
pose frequently, moving the mcr-1 gene into the IncHI2 scaffold
but also promoting its transposition in different plasmids. Multi-
focal plasmid types (IncP, IncX4, and IncI2) carrying mcr-1, but
not bla genes conferring resistance to extended-spectrum cepha-
losporins (ESCs), have been previously reported, and some of
them demonstrated a great potential for dissemination by conju-
gation among diverse Gram-negative species of the gut flora (1, 4,
18). Such colonizing bacteria may subsequently develop into dif-
ficult-to-treat infections, as observed for the ESBL producers ac-
quired by people traveling from low- to high-prevalence countries
(30–32).
The spread of non-ESC-R mcr-1-Ent could contribute to the
silent expansion of this life-threatening resistance gene in both
human and nonhuman settings. Specific and sensitive surveillance
programs should be rapidly implemented to prevent unexpected
outbreaks due to mcr-1-Ent.
