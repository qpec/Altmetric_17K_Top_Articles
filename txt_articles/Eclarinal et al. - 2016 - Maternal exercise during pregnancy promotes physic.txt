ABSTRACT: Previous rodent studies have shown that maternal voluntary exercise during pregnancy leads to meta-
bolic changes in adult offspring. We set out to test whether maternal voluntary exercise during pregnancy also
induces persistent changes in voluntary physical activity in the offspring. Adult C57BL/6J female mice were ran-
domly assigned to be caged with an unlocked (U) or locked (L) running wheel before and during pregnancy.
Maternal running behavior was monitored during pregnancy, and body weight, body composition, food intake,
energy expenditure, total cage activity, and running wheel activity were measured in the offspring at various ages.
U offspring were slightly heavier at birth, but no group differences in body weight or composition were observed at
later ages (when mice were caged without access to running wheels). Consistent with our hypothesis, U offspring
were more physically active as adults. This effect was observed earlier in female offspring (at sexual maturation).
Remarkably, at 300 d of age, U females achieved greater fat loss in response to a 3-wk voluntary exercise program.
Our findings show for the first time that maternal physical activity during pregnancy affects the offspring’s lifelong
propensity for physical activity and may have important implications for combating the worldwide epidemic of
physical inactivity and obesity.—Eclarinal, J. D., Zhu, S., Baker, M. S., Piyarathna, D. B., Coarfa, C., Fiorotto, M. L.,

KEY WORDS: developmental programming
• activity-stat
• metabolic imprinting
Environmental exposures during critical periods of em-
bryonic, fetal, and early postnatal life affect the develop-
ment of metabolic regulatory mechanisms, with lifelong
consequences for susceptibility to disease (1, 2). Maternal
overnutrition and obesity, for example, can promote obe-
sity and related metabolic disorders in offspring (3). In
fact, such developmental programming can have trans-
generational effects that perpetuate overweight and
obesity across successive generations (4). Targeting inter-
ventions to critical periods of development may therefore
be an effective approach to curbing the global obesity
epidemic (1, 5).
Most studies of developmental programming of
obesity and energy balance have focused on food in-
take (6), largely neglecting energy expenditure and, in
particular, physical activity (the component most
amenable to change) (6, 7). Physical activity can be
categorized as either voluntary exercise or spontaneous
physical activity (SPA). Voluntary exercise describes
physical activity that is not essential to survival and
homeostasis, and SPA is nonvolitional activity that re-
sults from daily living (fidgeting and random muscle
contractions) (8). In rodent studies, voluntary exercise is
typically modeled by wheel running, whereas cage ac-
tivity reflects SPA (8).
Rowland (9) proposed that one’s propensity for phys-
ical activity is set at a specific level known as the “activity-
stat,” a component of the control center that regulates
individual energy balance. Although there are clearly ge-
neticinfluencesontheactivity-stat(10),itssettingmayalso
be affected by environmental influences during critical
periods of development. For example, rodent studies have
shown that maternalfoodrestriction (11,12),consumption
of a low-protein diet (13, 14), and hyperleptinemia (15)
during pregnancy affect physical activity in adult off-
spring. Our recent studies in 2 models of developmental
programming of energy balance also indicate early influ-
ences on physical activity. In the small-litter (SL) mouse
model of early postnatal overnutrition, adult female SL

 offspring exhibited decreased physical activity and energy
expenditure (16). In the agouti viable yellow (Avy) mouse
model of maternal obesity, offspring of obese Avy/a dams
experienced fetal growth restriction but, when cross
fostered to lean a/a dams, exhibited postnatal catch-up
growth that was followed, in the females only, by persis-
tently blunted physical activity and increased adiposity
(17).WenotedthatobeseadultAvy/afemalesareextremely
inactive (17), and therefore, in addition to growth re-
striction, their offspring are exposed to low levels of
movement during fetal development. This finding sug-
gests that perhaps maternal physical activity before and
during pregnancy affects the establishment of the activity-
stat in the offspring.
Previous rodent studies have tested whether mater-
nal exercise before and during pregnancy affects met-
abolic outcomes in the offspring. In particular, 3 different
groups recently reported that maternal physical activ-
ity before and during pregnancy improves overall
glucose homeostasis, apparently by increasing insulin
sensitivity (18–21). Some of these studies also reported
increased lean mass and reduced adiposity in the off-
spring (18, 20). We postulated that these metabolic
improvements result from an increased propensity for
physical activity in the offspring of exercised dams.
Indeed, there is precedent to suggest that maternal
physical activity during pregnancy affects neurologic
development in the offspring, leading to persistent
improvements in short-term memory (22) and en-
hanced spatial learning (23).
We therefore set out to test the hypothesis that when
female mice are allowed to engage in voluntary exercise
(wheel running) before and during pregnancy, their off-
spring will be more physically active.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mouse husbandry and diet
This study was approved by the Baylor College of Medicine
Animal Care and Use Committee, and animals were maintained
in accordance with all relevant federal guidelines. Male and fe-
male C57BL/6J isogenic mice were obtained at 8 wk of age from
The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). The study was
conducted in 2 phases over the course of 1 yr (February 2014
through February2015). Phase 1 yielded 4 L and2 U litters; phase
2 yielded 4 litters per group. The mice were fed either a fixed-
formula, soy protein–free maintenance diet (2020X; Harlan
Teklad, Madison, WI, USA) or, during mating, pregnancy, and
lactation, a fixed-formula, soy protein–free reproductive diet
(2919X; Harlan Teklad).
Experimental design
The experimental design is illustrated in Fig. 1. In each phase,
12–16 virgin female mice, aged 8 wk (F0) were caged in-
dividually in rat cages equipped with a solid-surface running
wheel (diameter 14 cm; Pets International, Ltd., Arlington
Heights, IL, USA) and odometer (Cateye Velo 7; CatEye
America, Boulder, CO, USA). A preliminary test was con-
ducted to select dams to be included in the experiment. The
females were allowed access to running wheels for 2 wk and
were ranked based on average daily running distance during
the last week (referred to as preliminary test d 1–7). In each
phase, the most consistently active females were chosen for
the study. Selected females were randomly assigned to either
the U or L group and caged with their respective running
wheels. In the L group, the wheels were locked to prevent
running. After this 1-wk acclimation period, male C57BL/6J
mice were introduced into the cages. The females were
checked each morning for a vaginal plug. Once a plug was
observed, the male was removed from the cage. Wheel activity
(distance and average velocity) was recorded daily during the
acclimation and mating period, as well as throughout preg-
nancy and lactation. Wheels of the U dams were locked on
postnatal day (P)10 to prevent the pups from using them. Only
offspring from a birth litter of 7–10 pups were included; a
total of 6 U and 8 L litters were studied.
Metabolic cage studies
On P21, offspring were weaned and selected for metabolic
cage studies. From each litter, 1 male and 1 female mouse were
chosen based on body weight (closest to the average sex-
specific body weight in the litter). These mice were then
placed individually into Comprehensive Laboratory Animal
Monitoring System (CLAMS) cages (Columbus Instruments,
Columbus, OH, USA). For ;2 wk, food intake, energy ex-
penditure (by indirect calorimetry), and physical activity
were monitored (17). Each CLAMS cage was equipped with
optical beams to measure home cage activity (SPA), and an
instrumented running wheel (diameter, 9.8 cm) to measure
wheel activity (voluntary exercise). It should be noted that
wheel running does not cause any beam breaks, so cage ac-
tivity is independent of wheel running. This process was

 repeated at P60 and P160. During the periods between the
metabolic cage studies, the mice did not have access to run-
ning wheels. Across the 2 phases of the study, 12 U offspring
(6 male and 6 female) and 12 L offspring (6 male and 6 female)
were studied in the CLAMS cages. The same mice were
studied in the metabolic cages at each age; all remaining
offspring were observed longitudinally for body weight and
composition. During the CLAMS studies, the cages were
calibrated every 5–6 d, in accordance with the manufac-
turer’s guidelines and protocols published elsewhere (17). At
each study period, minimal energy expenditure was esti-
mated for each mouse by averaging the lowest energy ex-
penditure values from each of 3 d.
Body weight and body composition
Offspring body weight was recorded at P1, P21, P60, P120, P160,
and P300. Body composition was measured on P21, P60, and
P160, before the selected offspring were placed into the CLAMS
cages. After the end of P160 measurements, body weight and
composition were measured in all offspring, including those that
were not studied in the CLAMS cages. Body weight was mea-
sured with a calibrated integrating scale and body composition
by quantitative magnetic resonance (EchoMRI-100; Echo Medi-
cal Systems LLC, Houston, TX, USA), according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions.
P300 voluntary exercise study
At P300, female offspring (n = 12 U and 11 L) were individually
housed in rat cages, each equipped with a running wheel (14 cm
diameter) and an odometer (Cateye Velo 7) for a period of 3 wk.
Body weight and composition were measured before and after
the 3-wk period.
Statistical approaches
To eliminate data entry errors, all data in the study were en-
tered independently into 2 Excel spreadsheets (Microsoft,
Redmond WA, USA) and verified electronically. Study phase
(phase 1 or 2) was included in all statistical models, but was
not significant in any. Daily running distances over the 1 wk
preliminary test (before group assignment) of L and U dams
were compared by repeated-measures ANOVA (Proc Mixed,
autoregressive covariance structure; SAS Institute, Cary, NC,
USA), with “day” as the variable in the repeated effect. Group
differences in body weight and body composition at single
ages (e.g., at P1) were compared by repeated-measures
ANOVA, with litter as the variable in the repeated effect
(thus adjusting for the nonindependence of pups born to the
same dam). Body weight comparisons across multiple ages
were performed by repeated-measures ANOVA (SAS Proc
Mixed). To adjust for potential effects of housing in the
CLAMS cages, with access to running wheels, inclusion in the
CLAMS studies was a categorical variable in the body weight
and composition analyses. For the CLAMS studies, at each
age, the first several days in the metabolic cages were con-
sidered an acclimation period, and the data were discarded.
This method yielded 8 or more consecutive days of data for all
24 mice at each age. Data were sampled at 30 min intervals, so
each day yielded 48 data points per mouse for each variable.
These data (food intake, wheel running, cage activity, and
energy expenditure) were analyzed by repeated-measures
ANOVA, with age (d) and time (at 30 min intervals) as vari-
ables in the repeated effect. Models for intake (g/30 min),
distance traveled on wheel (km/30 min), cage activity
(counts/30 min), and expenditure (kcal/30 min) included main
effects of group, time, and age (d), as well as time 3 time, time 3
time 3 time, time 3 group, and age 3 group interactions. Study
phase(phase1or2)wasevaluatedinallmodelsbutwasomitted,as
it was never significant. Models for Intake and Expenditure in-
cluded lean mass (g) and fat mass (g) as independent variables to
adjust for effects of mouse body weight and composition (24). Ini-
tially, the full CLAMS models included sex and sex 3 group in-
teraction, and light (on or off), and light 3 group interaction. The
sex 3 group and light 3 group interactions were generally sig-
nificant, so models were run separately by sex and light. The P300
body composition data were analyzed by repeated-measures
ANOVA (with “week” as the repeated effect).

 RESULTS
Maternal voluntary exercise before
randomization and before and
during pregnancy
A preliminary test was conducted to ensure that all ran-
domized dams engaged in similar levels of voluntary
exercise. Dams with average daily running distance
;10 km and the least day-to-day variation were se-
lected (Fig. 2A) and randomly assigned to either the U
or L group. The results of randomization (Fig. 2B) show
that there were no overall differences between the 2
groups during the 7 d preliminary test (P = 0.58).
U and L dams were then individually caged with their
respective running wheels for 1 wk before mating. For
mating, males were in the cages for an average of
2 d (range, 1-4). Average daily running distance of U dams
declined from 15.1 to 10.5 km during the acclimation pe-
riod, and progressively diminished during pregnancy
(Fig. 2C). Notably, however, even at the beginning of the
3rd trimester of pregnancy, U dams were still running
;3 km each day. Aside from a small postpartum surge,
running was minimal during lactation. Average running
velocity also decreased during pregnancy (Fig. 2D).
Hence, although the U dams still ran ;1 km/day even in
late pregnancy, average running velocity was about half
that at the beginning of pregnancy.
Maternal exercise before and during
pregnancy increases offspring birth weight,
but does not affect adult body weight or
body composition
On P1,there was no group difference in littersize [L= 8.5 6
0.4(means6 SEM)andU=8.060.4pups/litter,P=0.4],but
U pups were significantly heavier than L pups (P = 0.007)
(Fig. 3A). By P21, there were no longer group differences in
body weight, and no differences were observed thereafter
(Fig. 3B). Likewise, we detected no differences in body
composition (% fat) between U and L offspring at P160, in
either males or females (Fig. 3C). These growth and body
composition data represent both the offspring that un-
derwentCLAMSstudiesandthosethatdidnot.Infemales,
inclusion in the CLAMS studies had no effect on growth or
P160body composition (P = 0.44 and P =0.51,respectively)
but among males, those included in the CLAMS studies
followed aslightly lower bodyweight trajectory (P =0.001)
and were slightly leaner at P160 (P = 0.007). There were no
significant group 3 CLAMS interactions in either sex.
Maternal exercise before and during
pregnancy increases offspring physical
activity and energy expenditure
Our previous studies (16, 17), indicated that develop-
mental programming of physical activity behavior is often
sex specific. We therefore wished to determine whether
potential sex-specific effects of maternal exercise were
evidentin the offspringdirectly after weaning or only after
sexual maturation. Accordingly, physical activity (both
wheel running and home cage activity), energy expendi-
ture, and food intake data were collected from male and
female U and L offspring at P21 (weaning), P60 (sexual
maturation), and P160 (adult).
In a few cases, subtle group differences in food intake
and wheel activity were evident during lights-on (resting)
periods (Fig. 4). However, because food intake and
physical activity are relatively low during the lights-on
period, our description of the results focuses on the dark
period. Relative to L males, U males exhibited no dark-
period differences in food intake or energy expenditure at
any age (Fig. 4A, 4D). U males showed no differences in
physical activity at P21 or P60, but by P160 they ran more
(Fig. 4B) and moved in their cages more (Fig. 4C) than L
males. (P21 energy expenditure data were not collected
because of an instrument malfunction.)
More consistent and substantial effects, particularly
in physical activity and energy expenditure, were ob-
served in female offspring (Fig. 4). At P60, dark-period
food intake was slightly higher in U than in L females
(Fig. 4A); however, the opposite trend was observed at
P160. At P21, there were no group differences in wheel
activity (Fig. 4B) or total cage activity (Fig. 4C) among
the females. By P60, U females ran more (Fig. 3B) and
Figure 3. Group differences in
body weight were found only at
P1. A) P1 body weight of U pups
(n = 6 litters) was higher than
that of L pups (n = 8 litters). P =
0.007. Box plots show median
(thick line), 25–75th percentiles

ence in body weight at P21,

ence in percentage body fat at

 moved more than L females (Fig. 3C). Consistent with
this result, overall dark-period energy expenditure was
slightly higher in U than in L females (Fig. 4D). The
increase in wheel running observed in P60 females
persisted to P160 (Fig. 4B). Moreover, although the
overall trends for increased cage activity (Fig. 4C) and
energy expenditure (Fig. 4D) in U females at P160 were
not statistically significant, the significant group3time
interactions (Table 1) reflect a sustained elevation in
cage activity and energy expenditure of U females
during the early part of the dark cycle.
Maternal exercise promotes fat loss in adult
female offspring that perform
voluntary exercise
It may seem inconsistent that we observed increased
physical activity (Fig. 4B) and a trend toward decreased
food intake (Fig. 4A) in U female offspring but no dif-
ferences in body weight or body composition (Fig.
3B, C). As one potential explanation, we considered
whether resting metabolic rate might be lower in U
offspring. Mice were not denied access to food during
the CLAMS studies, so it was not possible to measure
resting metabolic rate. However, estimates of minimal
energy expenditure showed no group differences at any
age (data not shown). Because only a subset of offspring
had access to running wheels and only during the study
periods (P21, P60, and P160), we hypothesized that,
when provided continuous access to a running wheel,
adult U females would run more and achieve greater fat
loss than L females. To test this theory, we studied P300
females and measured changes in body composition
during a 3-wk period of voluntary exercise training in
their home cages (running wheel exposure). (Due to a
limited number of running wheels, we studied only
females in this P300 test.)
Figure 4. Food intake, physical activity, and energy expenditure of L and U offspring. A) Active period (lights-off) food intake was
slightly higher in U than in L females at P60. The opposite trend at P160 was not statistically significant (Table 1). B) Wheel running
distance during the active period was higher in U than in L females at P60 and P160. This effect was observed in males at P160 only.
C) U males showed higher cage activity only at P160. In females, overall cage activity was higher in U than L females at P60; at P160,
a significant group 3 time interaction (Table 1) reflected higher activity during the early dark period. Increased cage activity was
also observed in U vs. L males, but only at P160. D) Dark-period energy expenditure was slightly higher in U than in L females at

MATERNAL EXERCISE DURING PREGNANCY
2545
Downloaded from www.fasebj.org by (77.173.35.219) on June 05, 2019. The FASEB Journal Vol. ${article.issue.getVolume()}, No. ${article.issue.getIssueNumber()}, pp. 2541-2548.
 There were no differences in body weight or com-
position (% fat) between U and L females at baseline,
and both groups achieved dramatic loss of body fat
during the 3 wk exercise program (Fig. 5). U females,
however, achieved a greater reduction in adiposity
than L females (P = 0.03). Because of technical diffi-
culties, we did not obtain data on running distance
during this test. However, based on our observations at
P60 and P160 (Fig. 4), it is likely that U females lost more
fat because they ran more. These data indicate that the
effects of maternal physical activity before and during
pregnancy persist to influence energy balance in ad-
vanced adulthood.
DISCUSSION
We found that maternal exercise directly before and dur-
ing pregnancy promotes physical activity in the offspring.
In female offspring this effect was first evident around
sexual maturity, and persisted into later adulthood. In-
creased physical activity was also observed in male off-
spring, but not until later in adulthood.
Previous studies have shown that nutrition can affect
developmental programming of physical activity (12,
16, 17, 25, 26), but we are aware of only one (27) that
examined effects of maternal exercise on offspring
physical activity. Consistent with our findings, that
study reported a significant positive correlation be-
tween maternal running distance during pregnancy
and offspring running distance in adulthood. Because
outbred ICR mice were used, however, those authors
concluded that this correlation was likely due to genetic
inheritance (27). Our findings in an isogenic population
of mice therefore provide the first clear indication that
maternal voluntary exercise before and during preg-
nancy affects the establishment of lifelong propensity
for voluntary exercise in her offspring. Since maternal
running during lactation was nearly negligible (Fig.
2B), this effect almost certainly occurred either directly
before or during pregnancy.
Rather than study a large number of mice, we
employed several design refinements to achieve high
power. The first was to minimize the influence of ge-
netic variation by studying inbred mice. The second
was to include a preliminary test to assess voluntary
exercise in the dams. Even among inbred dams, it is
possible that subtle de novo genetic variation could
influence both their voluntary exercise level and that
of their offspring. The preliminary test eliminated
such potential confounding, while also ensuring that
all U offspring were exposed to a consistent level of
maternal exercise. Third, recognizing the nonindepen-
dence of offspring born to the same dam, our metabolic
cage studies included only 1 male and 1 female off-
spring of each dam. Last, we performed our metabolic
and physical activity measurements over an extended

In addition to the group effect and time3group interaction, all models also included Time (30 min increments; linear, as well as

mass (g). Experiment phase (phase 1 or 2) was evaluated in all models, but was not significant and so was omitted from the final models.
Variable units were intake (g/30 min), running (km/30 min), cage activity (counts/30 min), and expenditure (kcal/30 min). *Statistically

 period at each age; even after excluding data during
the acclimation periods, at least 8 d of data per mouse
were analyzed at each age. The consistent findings of a
significant increase in voluntary exercise in U adults,
in both males and females (Fig. 4B), not only demon-
strates a robust effect but also indicates that our study
was appropriately powered.
We believe our results may help explain previous
observations that maternal exercise during pregnancy
improves offspring glucose tolerance and insulin sensi-
tivity. Using designs similar to ours, 4 previous studies
reported that maternal voluntary exercise before and
during pregnancy improves glucose tolerance in adult
offspring (18–20, 28). Three of these (18–20) also showed
that the improved glucose tolerance was associated with
enhanced insulin sensitivity. Because physical activity is
well known to improve both glucose tolerance and in-
sulin sensitivity (29, 30), some of the metabolic effects of
maternal exercise during pregnancy on adult offspring
(18–20, 28) may simply be a consequence of increased
physical activity in the offspring. Consistent with pre-
vious studies (18–20, 28), we did not detect an overall
difference in body weight or adiposity in U offspring in
normal housing conditions. We found such an effect only
by providing adult offspring sustained access to running
wheels. It is important in future studies to determine
whether more dramatic effects of maternal exercise are
unmasked by providing the offspring with permanent
access to running wheels, perhaps in combination with a
high-fat diet challenge.
In addition to genetic factors (10), environmental
influences during critical ontogenic periods, including
fetal (12, 17), early postnatal (16), and even postweaning
development (31) can influence the entrainment of the
activity-stat. Our current findings confirm the important
role of early environment in the establishment of the
activity-stat and provide the novel insight that physical
movement during fetal development may affect the de-
velopment of central mechanisms regulating physical
activity behavior. Indeed, gravity is necessary for ap-
propriate development of the vestibular system in the
mammalian CNS (32), underscoring the potential for
acceleration (movement) to broadly affect fetal brain
development. Our current understanding of central
regulation of volitional physical activity remains ru-
dimentary (8), so further extensive study is needed to
elucidate the specific mechanisms underlying the pro-
gramming effect reported here. Recent reports indicate
that not just maternal but also paternal physical activ-
ity may have long-term consequences for offspring
metabolism and body weight (33, 34) and brain func-
tion (35).
We found that offspring born to exercised dams
had higher body weight at P1 (an approximation of
birth weight), indicating that maternal exercise had a
positive effect on fetal growth. Clinical studies have
reported conflicting data on the effects of maternal
exercise during pregnancy on birth weight. In both a
small observational study (36) and a randomized con-
trolled trial of home-based stationary cycling (37), ma-
ternal exercise during pregnancy predicted decreased
birth weight. Other clinical studies, however, have re-
ported contrary results. For example, a retrospective
case–control study concluded that light physical activ-
ity during the second trimester of gestation protects
against low birth weight (38). Overall, a recent meta-
analysis (5322 pregnancies) found that maternal exer-
cise during pregnancy does not change the risk of
delivering a small-for-gestational-age infant, but re-
duces the risk of large-for-gestational-age birth (39).
Hence, our findings are not inconsistent with the hu-
man data and suggest that maternal exercise, especially
initiated during or before early pregnancy, may result
in improved placental development or function.
Clinical studies have also attempted to assess long-
term effects of maternal exercise on the offspring. The
previously mentioned observational study (36) found
lower body weight and adiposity at age 5 in the off-
spring of mothers who exercised before and during
pregnancy. Two additional human observational studies
examined associations between maternal exercise and
the activity level of the offspring. In the first (40), the
physical activity levels of more than 5000 preteen
children were analyzed in comparison with their par-
ents’ activity levels. Parental physical activity levels
during pregnancy and in the children’s early life cor-
related positively with those in their children. In the
second, the activity levels of 554 preschool children
correlated positively with those in their mothers (41).
In all of these observational studies, however, these
positive correlations could merely reflect effects of
parenting or genetic differences, rather than develop-
mental programming. Prospective randomized con-
trolled studies of the offspring of women assigned
to exercise interventions are needed to determine
whether maternal physical activity during pregnancy
has a positive effect on spontaneous physical activity
in humans.
In summary, among the many studies on develop-
mental programming of physical activity, ours is the
first to show that maternal exercise before and dur-
ing pregnancy influences the propensity for physical
activity in the offspring. If similar effects can be con-
firmed in humans, this would suggest a straightfor-
ward and effective intervention to combat the current
worldwide epidemic of physical inactivity (42) and
obesity.
