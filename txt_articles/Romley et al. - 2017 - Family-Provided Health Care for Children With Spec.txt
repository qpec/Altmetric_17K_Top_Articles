abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Many children with special health care needs (CSHCN) receive 
health care at home from family members, but the extent of this care is poorly quantified. 
This study’s goals were to create a profile of CSHCN who receive family-provided health 
care and to quantify the extent of such care.
METHODS: We analyzed data from the 2009–2010 National Survey of Children with Special 
Health Care Needs, a nationally representative sample of 40 242 parents/guardians 
of CSHCN. Outcomes included sociodemographic characteristics of CSHCN and their 
households, time spent by family members providing health care at home to CSHCN, and the 
total economic cost of such care. Caregiving hours were assessed at (1) the cost of hiring 
an alternative caregiver (the “replacement cost” approach), and (2) caregiver wages (the 
“foregone earnings” approach).
RESULTS: Approximately 5.6 million US CSHCN received 1.5 billion hours annually of family-
provided health care. Replacement with a home health aide would have cost an estimated 
$35.7 billion or $6400 per child per year in 2015 dollars ($11.6 billion or $2100 per child 
per year at minimum wage). The associated foregone earnings were $17.6 billion or $3200 
per child per year. CSHCN most likely to receive the greatest amount of family-provided 
health care at home were ages 0 to 5 years, were Hispanic, lived below the federal poverty 
level, had no parents/guardians who had finished high school, had both public and private 
insurance, and had severe conditions/problems.
CONCLUSIONS: US families provide a significant quantity of health care at home to CSHCN, 
representing a substantial economic cost.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Many children 
with special health care needs receive health care 
at home from family members, but no studies 
systematically document the volume and cost of this 
care, which are likely to be substantial.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Each year, American 
families provide 1.5 billion hours of health care at 
home to children with special health care needs. The 
economic cost of this care is in the tens of billions of 
dollars.

ROMLEY et al 
Starting with Medicare’s 1966 push 
for home health alternatives, 
 
1 the 
health care system has increasingly 
asked family members to care for 
the chronically ill at home in an 
effort to improve patient quality of 
life and contain inpatient costs. 
2 
 
– 
6 
Concomitantly, technological 
advances have helped move 
interventions from the inpatient to 
home setting. 
4 Family members now 
perform medical tasks in the home 
that extend well beyond what were 
perceived as familial responsibilities 
several decades ago, 
 
7, 
 
8 from 
maintaining and operating 
medical devices (eg, ventilators) 
to administering nontechnological 
interventions (eg, physical therapy).
Providing health care at home, 
however, is time intensive for 
family members. 
9 Time spent 
delivering care is time that could 
be spent attending to other family 
responsibilities, employment 
obligations, and leisure activities. 
Family-provided health care can 
result in employment disruptions, 
financial distress, social isolation, 
marital dissatisfaction, and reduced 
quality of life for families of 
children with special health care 
needs (CSHCN). 
8, 
 
10 
 
– 
14 A better 
understanding of this care could 
inform efforts to support families of 
CSHCN. Unlike services from home 
health agencies, however, family-
provided health care operates in 
the “informal” economy and is 
unpaid. Consequently, no records 
systematically document the 
volume and cost of care provided. 
In this study, we use nationally 
representative survey data to 
estimate these figures.
METHODS
Dataset and Defi
 nition of CSHCN
We used the 2009–2010 National 
Survey of Children with Special Health 
Care Needs (NS-CSHCN), a nationally 
representative, household-level 
telephone survey. A random sample of 
196 159 US households was screened 
for the presence of CSHCN, defined 
as children ≤18 years identified by 
parents/guardians (hereafter referred 
to as parents) as having “one or 
more chronic physical, behavioral, or 
emotional conditions who also require 
health and related services of a type 
or amount beyond that required by 
children generally.” Eligible parents 
were asked about the child’s health 
care needs, access, and use. If multiple 
children in the home met criteria, one 
was randomly selected. The dataset 
contained 40 242 interviews with 
parents of CSHCN. Interview-level 
survey weights were assigned to 
ensure that the sample was nationally 
representative. Additional details 
appear elsewhere. 
15
Variables
Variables included characteristics 
of the household (income, highest 
parental education level, state of 
residence, and if any family members 
experienced financial problems, 
reduced work hours, stopped work, 
or avoided changing jobs because of 
the child’s condition) and child (age, 
sex, race/ethnicity, insurance status, 
continuity and adequacy of coverage, 
20 current health conditions, and 
school days missed due to illness). 
We characterized respondents' 
assessment of the extent to which 
the child’s condition(s)/problem(s) 
limited doing things other children 
do as never, sometimes, or consistent 
and/or great 
15; severity was also 
indicated by the number of CSHCN 
screening criteria met. 
16 Presence 
of government-mandated paid 
family leave was based on state of 
residence. 
7 Outcomes were analyzed 
based on nonmissing responses. 
For explanatory variables (eg, age), 
an unknown category (response 
of “don’t know” or “refused, 
” or 
incomplete survey) was included.
Time Spent on Family-Provided 
Health Care
The survey asked about time family 
members spent providing health 
care for their child: “Many families 
provide health care at home such as 
changing bandages, care of feeding 
or breathing equipment, and giving 
medication and therapies. Do 
you or any other family members 
provide health care at home for [said 
child]?” 
15 If necessary, the survey 
provided additional clarification: 
“Please base your answers on the 
last several weeks, 
” and, “Only 
include care related to the child’s 
condition.” 
15 Respondents who 
answered “yes” were asked, “How 
many hours per week do you or other 
family members spend providing this 
kind of care?” Additional clarification 
included: “It is fine to provide an 
average number of hours per week 
based on several weeks. Please 
give your best estimate, 
” and “Only 
include care related to the child’s 
condition.” 
15 A respondent could 
report multiple conditions.
In the public data set that we 
analyzed for this paper, responses 
above 10 hours per week were 
reported in intervals of 11 to 20 
and 21+ hours. To estimate average 
hours per week, we used 15.5 (the 
midpoint) for the 11 to 20 interval 
and 21 for the 21+ interval. In a 
sensitivity analysis with maximally 
conservative estimates, we used 11 
for the 11 to 20 interval. The survey 
differentiated between time spent 
providing health care at home and 
time spent coordinating health care 
outside the home with analogous 
questions for the number of hours 
family members spent arranging, 
scheduling, or organizing health care. 
The survey also covered financial 
problems and effects on employment.
Cost of Family-Provided Health Care
We estimated the cost of family-
provided health care using 2 
approaches. 
17, 
 
18 The “replacement 
cost” approach estimated what it 
would cost to obtain a similar amount 
of skilled or unskilled labor from 
the market. Skilled and unskilled 
labor were estimated by assigning

caregiving hours the average cost 
of hiring a home health aide and the 
minimum wage in 2010, respectively, 
in the family’s state of residence. 
18 
–20
The “foregone earnings” approach 
estimated wages lost due to 
caregiving by assigning caregiving 
hours the median hourly earnings 
rate, adjusted for labor force 
participation and rates of full- and 
part-time work based on data from 
the US Bureau of Labor Statistics’ 
2010 Current Population Survey. 
21 
Because labor market activity varies 
with demographics, we performed 
a supplementary analysis stratified 
by race/ethnicity, as described in the 
Supplemental Information.
Monetary values are reported in 
2015 US dollars (USD), applying the 
appropriate consumer price index.
Statistical Analyses
Logistic regression was used to 
analyze caregiving, whereas linear 
regression was used to analyze hours 
spent caregiving. Procedures for 
complex survey data were used to 
produce representative estimates 
and to perform valid statistical 
inference; hypothesis tests were 
based on probabilities of 0.025 in 
each tail. All analyses were with 
Stata, version 14 (Stata Corp, College 
Station, TX). This study was deemed 
exempt by the Boston Children’s 
Hospital Institutional Review Board.
RESULTS
Profi
 le of CSHCN and Family-
Provided Health Care
The percentage of CSHCN receiving 
family-provided health care was 
49.7% ( 
Table 1). The CSHCN most 
likely to receive any care were 0 to 5 
years old (61.5% vs 39.9% for those 
12–17 years old; P < .001), identified 
as other race (53.2% vs 48.3% of 
non-Hispanic white children; P < 
.001), and lived below the federal 
poverty level (FPL) (52.8% vs 44.0% 
of those 400% of the FPL; P < .001). 
Those most likely to receive any 
care also described their condition 
as always or greatly affecting daily 
activities (57.2% vs 42.1% of those 
for whom daily activities were never 
affected; P < .001), met 4 to 5 CSHCN 
screening criteria (62.6% vs 45.3% of 
those meeting 1 criterion; P < .001), 
and had both public and private 
health insurance (55.7% vs 45.4% 
of those with only private coverage; 
P < .001); additional details appear 
in Supplemental Table 6. Fourteen 
of 20 specific health conditions were 
associated with a greater likelihood 
of receiving family health care 
relative to not having the condition 
( 
Table 2).
TIME SPENT ON FAMILY-PROVIDED 
HEALTH CARE FOR CSHCN
On average, CSHCN with family-
provided health care received 5.1 
hours of care per week for a total 
of 1.5 billion hours nationally. Our 
conservative sensitivity analysis 
estimated an average of 4.9 hours 
of care per week. Conditions with 
the highest average amount of care 
included muscular dystrophy (13.8 
h/wk); cerebral palsy (14.4 h/wk); 
cystic fibrosis (12.9 h/wk); 
intellectual disability or mental 
retardation (11.2 h/wk); and head 
injury, concussion, or traumatic brain 
injury (11.9 h/wk) ( 
Table 2). Parents 
who spent time coordinating health 
care outside the home averaged 3.9 
hours per week on those activities.
Among care recipients, 11.7% 
received ≥21 hours of family-provided 
health care per week ( 
Table 3). 
CSHCN most likely to receive such 
care were 0 to 5 years old (14.9%), 
identified as Hispanic (19.1%), and 
lived below the FPL (20.0% vs 5.1% 
of those 400% of the FPL; P < .001). 
Those most likely to receive such 
care also had conditions/problems 
that consistently or greatly affected 
daily activities (26.9%), met 4 to 5 
CSHCN screening criteria (28.8%), 
had no parents who had finished high 
school (23.0%), had both public and 
private insurance (22.2%), and lived 
in a state with a paid family leave 
program (16.9%). The conditions of 
children most likely to receive this 
level of care included cystic fibrosis 
(odds ratio [OR] = 5.427), muscular 
dystrophy (OR = 4.111), diabetes 
(OR = 3.355), and cerebral palsy 
(OR = 2.563) ( 
Table 4). Among 
CSHCN with generally less time-
intensive conditions (eg, asthma) who 
received this level of care, nearly 90% 
also reported more time-intensive 
conditions (eg, cystic fibrosis).
Cost of Family-Provided Health Care 
for CSHCN
The annual replacement cost of 
family-provided health care at home 
for CSHCN in the United States 
was estimated at $35.7 billion 
and $11.9 billion based on skilled 
and unskilled labor, respectively 
( 
Table 5). Purchasing an equivalent 
amount of care from home health 
agencies or from people earning the 
minimum wage would have cost 
families $6400 or $2100 per child 
per year, respectively. In states 
with paid family leave at the time of 
data collection (California and New 
Jersey), replacement cost (based on 
skilled labor) was estimated at $4.1 
billion. Under the foregone earnings 
approach, the annual national cost 
associated with 5.1 hours per week 
of family-provided health care at 
home for CSHCN was estimated at 
$17.6 billion ($3200 per child per 
year.) Foregone earnings from the 
supplementary analysis stratified 
by race/ethnicity were estimated at 
$16.3 billion.
Nationally, caregivers reported 
higher rates than non-caregivers 
of experiencing financial problems, 
reducing work hours, stopping work, 
or avoiding changing jobs out of 
concern about health insurance as a 
direct result of the child’s condition 
(26.9% vs 16.3% experiencing 
financial problems, 21.8% vs 13.1% 
reducing work hours, 20.3% vs 
3

ROMLEY et al 
10.0% stopping work, and 21.3% vs 
14.2% avoiding job changes; all 
P < .001). These effects were greater 
for caregivers whose children had 
more severe conditions; for example, 
financial problems were reported for 
43.9% of children whose conditions/
problems limited their daily activities 
consistently or a great deal versus 
16.2% for children whose daily 
activities were never affected 
(P < .001).
DISCUSSION
Although caring for CSHCN is often 
rewarding, an extensive literature 
has addressed the psychosocial, 
health, and employment challenges 
experienced by family members.

This study examined the time that 
families spend providing health care 
at home to CSHCN and estimated the 
economic costs of family-provided 
health care.
Using data from the 2009–2010 
NS-CSHCN, we found that 5.6 million 
of 11.2 million CSHCN in the United 
States received an average of 5.1 
hours of family-provided health 
care per week for a yearly total of 
1.5 billion hours of care. Although 
families of children without special 
health care needs certainly spend 
time caring for their children, 
almost 12% of CSHCN received ≥21 
hours of family health care each 
week. Under the replacement cost 
approach, the annual national cost 
of this care was estimated at $11.9 
to $35.7 billion, depending on the 
ratio of skilled versus unskilled labor 
needed. Under the foregone earnings 
approach, the annual cost of this care 
was estimated at $17.6 billion. The 
difference between these estimates 
reflects the fact that the imputed 
hourly wages of family caregivers 
was higher than state-mandated 
minimum wages but lower than the

cost of hiring a home health aide. 
These estimates suggest that the 
magnitude of caregiving for CSHCN is 
substantial and that if families were 
to stop or significantly reduce the 
amount of care they provided, major 
gaps in health care would be exposed.
It may be informative to compare 
our findings with the cost of family 
care for a high-need population at 
the opposite end of the age spectrum. 
The annual national replacement 
cost of informal caregiving for older 
individuals with dementia was 
estimated at $106 billion in 2010 
US dollars (USD) 
17 ($114 billion in 
2015 USD), and the replacement 
costs of informal caregiving for older 
individuals generally were estimated 
at $221 to $624 billion, depending on 
the ratio of skilled versus unskilled 
labor required. 
18 The estimated 
annual replacement cost per older 
person with dementia is $30 839 
in 2010 USD. 
17 Informal caregiving 
for dementia differs from informal 
caregiving for CSHCN in ways that 
make a direct comparison of the costs 
difficult. In this study, we focus on the 
provision of health care tasks, such as 
changing bandages and maintaining 
breathing equipment. The dementia 
estimates presented above, in 
contrast, focus on assistance with 
activities of daily living (eg, bathing, 
dressing, grooming, shopping, 
laundry). Therefore, the tasks 
captured in the dementia studies 
reflect baseline societal expectations 
of parents that were explicitly 
excluded from the NS-CSHCN. Had 
these tasks been included, the CSHCN 
cost estimates would be much higher.
CSHCN have 3 times the health care 
expenditures, including out-of-pocket 
costs, of other children. 
31, 
 
32 
Moreover, caregiving can take a 
physical, psychological, and financial 
toll and is associated with increased 
stress, morbidity, and mortality. 
33 
–35 
In caregivers of children with 
cerebral palsy, greater caregiving 
demands have been associated with 
poorer caregiver physical health 
and greater psychological distress, 
cognitive problems, and emotional 
problems. 
24, 
 
27 Similarly, parents of 
CSHCN are more likely to experience 
poorer physical and emotional health 
than parents of other children. 
25, 
 
36 
Caregiving families also experience 
financial problems, reduce work 
hours, and stop work altogether at 
higher rates than families that do not 
provide health care to CSHCN, 
24, 
 
37 
and financial problems and work loss 
tend to increase with the severity of 
the child’s condition. 
26, 
 
29 In a national 
sample of children with medical 
complexity, a subset of CSHCN 
with higher care needs, over half of 
families reported financial problems 
and over half reported that a family 
member stopped working because 
of the child’s health. 
30 Likewise, a 
study of 167 families of children 
with medical complexity found that 
nearly one-half reported financial 
problems, 60% reported that a family 
member stopped working, and 66% 
reported that a family member cut 
back on work because of the child’s 
health.38 These physical, emotional, 
and financial outcomes, in turn, have 
been found to negatively affect care, 
health outcomes, and quality of life 
for CSHCN.

suggests that clinicians might 
be able to help through simpler 
interventions. Clinicians can optimize 
care plans for families and help them 
obtain assistance and support.

Simplifying treatment regimens 
and making home visits can reduce 
caregiver hardships.

and CSHCN48

51; future NS-CSHCN 
versions could assess the use of 
nonfamily caregivers in the home. 
Families with the most care needs 
(poor, nonwhite, less educated, and 
publicly insured) may benefit most 
from such interventions; however, 
their ability to effectively access 
these resources may be limited.
The US Department of Veterans 
Affairs recently implemented a 
number of such initiatives for 
community-based veterans that 
might apply to families with CSHCN. 
These include requiring clinical 
records to indicate all family 
caregivers, a care plan, and answers 
to screening questions about 
caregiving burden (eg, the Zarit 
Burden Scale 
52), as well as 
providing stipends to select family 
caregivers.

flexibility and facilitate time-banking 
of shared leave among employees. 
45 
Paid family leave programs 
55 
 
–58 
represent another policy option 
for allowing parents to care for 
sick children. 
59 We found that the 
percentage of families providing ≥21 
hours of care per week for CSHCN 
in states with these programs was 
significantly higher than in states 
without, although this pattern does 
not necessarily reflect a causal effect 
of the legislation.
Families with CSHCN may benefit 
from the access to care and financial 
protection that the Affordable 
Care Act (ACA) can provide, but 
potentially relevant provisions took 
effect only after the survey was 
conducted. The next NS-CSHCN wave, 
which runs through 2017, will likely 
enable insight into the effects of the 
ACA, as well as other recent policies.
Even with the ACA, however, health 
plans typically do not cover home 
care provided by family members. 
Insurance for informal care might be 
particularly vulnerable to adverse 
selection (people who most need 
the insurance are the most likely to 
buy it) and moral hazard (people 
who buy the insurance are heavily 
incentivized to use it), which 
might rapidly drive up prices. This 
possibility has been widely noted 
in the context of long-term care for 
adults. 
60 The existing long-term care 
insurance market is small (and too 
expensive for all but the wealthiest 
Americans), suggesting strong 
adverse selection and moral hazard 
potential.
This study has several limitations. 
First, both the replacement cost 
and foregone earnings approach 
make a number of assumptions. In 
the replacement cost method, for 
instance, caregiving time is assigned 
the cost of hiring a home health 
aide or the minimum wage. This 
method assumes that replacement 
cost is identical to that of general 
home health services or unskilled

labor, which may not be the case, 
depending on the child’s needs. In 
the foregone earnings approach, 
more disaggregated data on earnings 
would have been desirable (eg, by 
both race and ethnicity). Second, 
neither method captures all costs 
associated with such care. Studies 
have shown, for example, that 
the stress of caregiving for family 
members increases the risk of a 
caregiver’s own morbidity and 
mortality. 
61 
– 
63 The costs associated 
with treating these health issues, 
however, are not considered in 
either estimate. Third, the foregone 
earnings estimate does not account 
for the possibility that those who 
provided care may have been more 
likely to earn relatively low wages. 
Although others have developed a 
strategy to account for such selection 
in the context of elder care, 
 
18 the 
survey did not include adequate 
detail for this approach. In future 
survey waves, additional questions 
about parental employment 
(including wages and hours worked) 
would be informative (as would 
additional questions about various 
caregiving activities.) Fourth, survey 
data pertaining to caregiving time 
may be particularly vulnerable to 
misreporting. Respondents may, 
for instance, conflate time spent 
providing health care at home 
with time spent performing more 
traditional caregiving duties; the 
NS-CSHCN did not include the latter 
category, making it impossible to 
directly differentiate between these 
care types in our analyses.
CONCLUSIONS
Our analysis suggests that family-
provided health care represents 
a critical component of the health 
care system for CSHCN. Overall, US 
families provide an estimated 1.5 
billion hours of health care at home 
each year to CSHCN, sometimes, 
especially for children with the most 
complex conditions, experiencing 
negative psychosocial, health, 
and employment effects as a 
result.

– 
27, 
29, 
 
30, 
 
36 
– 
38 The annual 
national economic cost of this care 
would be an estimated $12 billion 
if family hours were replaced with 
unskilled labor from outside the 
home, and an estimated $36 billion if 
they were replaced with skilled labor. 
Clinical interventions and policy 
responses could mitigate the impact 
on families.
