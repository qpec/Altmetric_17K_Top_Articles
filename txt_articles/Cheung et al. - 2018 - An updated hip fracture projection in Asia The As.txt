Objectives: Hip fracture is a major public health problem. Earlier studies projected that the total number
of hip fracture will increase dramatically by 2050, and most of the hip fracture will occur in Asia. To date,
only a few studies provided the updated projection, and none of them focused on the hip fracture
projection in Asia. Thus, it is essential to provide the most up to date prediction of hip fracture in Asia,
and to evaluate the total direct medical cost of hip fracture in Asia.
Methods: We provide the updated projection of hip fracture in 9 Asian Federation of Osteoporosis So-
cieties members using the most updated incidence rate and projected population size.
Results: We show that the number of hip fracture will increase from 1,124,060 in 2018 to 2,563,488 in
2050, a 2.28-fold increase. This increase is mainly due to the changes on the population demographics,
especially in China and India, which have the largest population size. The direct cost of hip fracture will
increase from 9.5 billion United State dollar (USD) in 2018 to 15 billion USD in 2050, resulting a 1.59-fold
increase. A 2%e3% decrease in incidence rate of hip fracture annually is required to keep the total number
of hip fracture constant over time.

1. Introduction
Osteoporotic fracture is a major public health problem that is
known to be associated with increased dependency, morbidity,
and mortality. Among all osteoporotic fracture, hip fracture in-
curs the greatest morbidity, mortality, and costs. Studies by
Cooper et al. [1] and Gullberg et al. [2] in 1990s projected that
approximately 4.50e6.26 million of hip fractures will occur
worldwide by 2050, where half of them will occur in Asia. Thus,
a huge effort, including improve diagnosis and medications,
various fracture prevention programmes, and research, has been
undertaken to reduce the incidence of fracture worldwide.
Multiple studies have shown that incidence of hip fracture has
been stabilized or reduced slightly in many countries or cities, such
as Spain [3], Japan [4], United States [5], France [6], Taiwan [7], and
Hong Kong [8]. However, this might not be the case for some
countries, such as China [9,10] and Korea [11,12]. On the other hand,
life expectancy worldwide has increased by 5 years in the last 15
years, according to the World Health Organization [13]. This implies
that the total number of hip fracture may be continue to rise with
the changing demographics, despite the decrease in the incidence
of hip fracture reported in some countries. Therefore, we aim to
provide the best estimate of hip fracture in Asia using the most
updated information, and to evaluate the total direct medical cost
of hip fracture in Asia.
2. Methods
2.1. Data sources
Data on incidence rate of hip fracture was obtained from 9
Asian Federation of Osteoporosis Societies (AFOS) members,
including China [14,15], Hong Kong [16], India [17], Japan
[18,19],
Korea
[20],
Malaysia
[21],
Singapore
[21],
Taiwan
[22,23], and Thailand [24] (Table 1). For Taiwan, we noted that a
large difference in the incidence of hip fracture were estimated
by two studies, due to Chie et al. [22] and Wang et al. [23] used
International Classification of Diseases (ICD), 9th revision (ICD-
9) of 820.XX (proximal femur fracture) and 820.XX to 821.XX
(other femur fracture) to define hip fracture, respectively. To be
conservative, we included both studies in the estimation of the
total number of hip fracture. Only publications using nation-
wide or big databank that provided age-specific incidence of hip
fracture between ages 50 and � 80 years were included. Such
decision provides a more accurate projection and accounts for a
more realistic impact on total numbers of hip fractures due to
change in the population demographics. Since 2 sets of hip
fracture data were available for China, Japan, and Taiwan, the
mean of the two estimates was used.
Similarly, direct costs of hip fracture were obtained from pub-
lications and available government data (Table 2) from China [25],

 Hong Kong [26], India [27], Japan [28], Korea [13], Malaysia [27],
Singapore [29], Taiwan [30], and Thailand [31]. The projection of
direct medical cost was calculated assuming there was no secular
change in incidence of hip fracture and unit cost.
2.2. Statistical analysis
For ease of comparison, we provided the incidences of hip
fracture based on the following stratified age groups: 50e54,
55e59, 60e64, 65e69, 70e74, 75e79, and �80 years. In cases
where published data included incidence of hip fracture for age
groups beyond 80 years (e.g., 80e84, 85e89, and �90 years), the
incidence of hip fracture for the group �80 years was estimated
based on the population structure of the study populations in the
study year.
Projections for hip fractures was done in the year of 2025, 2030,
2035, 2040, 2045, and 2050 based on the most recent available sex-
and age-specific incidence of hip fracture and the predicted pop-
ulation size in these years by the Worldbank (available at http://
www.worldbank.org/), except the predicted population size of
Taiwan was from the United Nations (http://data.un.org/Default.
aspx), since such data was unavailable in the Worldbank. We
multiplied the incidence of hip fracture for each of the 5-year age
groups for each sex by the predicted number of population in each
group to calculate the projected total numbers of hip fractures. The
same method was used to calculate the projected direct medical
cost. The projected total number of hip fracture was further esti-
mated assuming 1%, 2%, and 3% increase or decrease of incidence
rate in involved AFOS members since the study year of the pub-
lished data in the respective country or region.
3. Results
We identified hip fracture incidence in 9 AFOS members that
were suitable for analysis. The total population of 9 AFOS members
in 2018 was 3.19 billion, which accounts for 70.3% and 42.0% of the
Asia and World population, respectively.
Table 1 shows the incidences of hip fracture based on previously
published data in 9 AFOS members, graph showing the difference
in hip fracture incidence between the countries is provided as Fig.1.
Assuming there was no substantial change in hip fracture incidence
since the study year, the projected number of hip fracture in the
study areas will be 1.12 million in 2018, and it will reach 2.56
million by 2050 (Table 3), equivalent to 2.28-fold increase when
compared to 2018. Malaysia and Japan are projected to have the
highest (3.55 fold) and the lowest (1.36 fold) increase in the total
number of hip fractures by 2050, respectively. The absolute number
increase in projected hip fracture in 2050 will be 0.515 million in
male, 0.925 million in female, and 1.44 million in overall population
for all AFOS members. The increase will be mainly contributed by
China (0.681 millions) and India (0.460 millions), which explains
79% of the total increase.
Assuming there is a 1%, 2%, and 3% increase in hip fracture
incidence annually calculated from the study year, the total
numbers of hip fractures are expected to reach 3.8, 5.6, and 8.3
million in 2050, respectively (Table 4). On the other hand, if there
were a 1%, 2%, and 3% decrease in hip fracture incidence annually
since the study year, the total number of hip fractures will then be
1.7, 1.2, and 0.77 million, respectively (Table 5).
For the direct medical cost of hip fractures, the projected cost in
2018 will be USD 9.5 billion, and the projected cost increasing to
USD 15 billion by 2050.
4. Discussion
The current study projected that the total number of hip frac-
tures in the studied Asian countries or geographic regions will in-
crease from 1.12 million in 2018 to 2.56 million in 2050. Similarly,
the direct medical cost will increase from USD 9.5 billion in 2018 to
USD 15 billion in 2050.
Cooper et al. [1] and Gullberg et al. [2] projected that the total
numbers of hip fractures in Asia by 2050 will be 3.25 million and
2.02 million (45% of the total numbers of hip fractures), respec-
tively. Thus, Asia has long been regarded as a “high risk” region with
the highest increase in hip fracture number. The projections made
by Cooper and Gullberg were only based on incidence data ob-
tained from 1 to 3 countries in Asia and had been outdated since
over 20 years had passed after the article had been published. Using
the most updated incidence rate and projected population size, our
estimation shows that the total number of hip fracture in 9 Asian
countries or regions would reach 2.56 million. Notably, this number
will be greater if the whole Asia is included in the projection. For
instance, if the hip fracture incidence rate for remaining parts of
Asia is assumed to be similar to that in 9 AFOS member countries or
regions, the total number of hip fracture occurrences would be
estimated to about 3.66 million, which is more than that projected
by Cooper and Gullberg.
The increase in total number of hip fracture is expected to be
highest in Malaysia and the lowest in Japan. According to the data
from United Nations (http://data.un.org), the median age in
Malaysia and Japan is 26.99 years and 45.53 years in 2012. Thus, the
prevalence of hip fracture in Malaysia is expected to be lower than
that in Japan. This also explains the greatest increase in total
number of hip fracture is in Malaysia, while the lowest increase is
expected to be in Japan, a country with the highest proportion of
elderly citizens. China and India contribute to the highest absolute

 number increase in hip fracture, because these 2 countries have the
highest population size. Indeed, these 2 countries constitute
approximately 37% of the world population. Thus, hip fracture is
expected to be a huge burden for Asia.
Hip fracture is not only a personal medical issue, but it affects
the family, the whole community and by extension the whole
nation. The current study estimated that the direct medical cost in
2018 reaches USD 9.5 billion, and the cost will escalate to USD 15
billion by 2050. The increase in direct medical cost in 2050 (1.59
fold) is lower than the increase in number of hip fractures in 2050
(2.28 fold; Table 3). This is due to the direct medical costs of hip
fracture for the countries with the highest increase in the number
of hip fracture (China and India) are generally lower (Table 2);
whereas Japan, the country with the highest direct medical cost,
has the lowest increment in the number of hip fractures by 2050
(Table 3). It should be noted that given the burgeoning economic
development in China and India, it is expected that the direct
medical cost will increase over time. Thus, the projected direct cost
from these countries would be underestimated.
It is alarming that the projected number of hip fracture remains
very high, even though a great effort in diagnosis, fracture pre-
vention, and research has been undertaken. With the estimation in
Table 5, the main target in Asia is to reduce the annual incidence of
hip fracture by 2%e3% each year, in order to stabilize the total
number of hip fracture over time. To achieve this goal, various
stakeholders, including patients, patient families, healthcare pro-
fessionals, and governments, need to be actively involved. There
could be 10 recommendations for the goal-attaining strategy. First,
Asian governments should make more resources available for the
management of osteoporosis. AFOS has published a declaration on
osteoporosis in Asia [32], which is a big step forward to galvanise
the stakeholders to focus on the size of osteoporotic fracture and its
impact on the populations. This would not only raise the awareness
for the health professionals, but also national health policy makers

 for resource allocation and effective programs to reduce future
fractures. Second, increase public awareness of osteoporosis and
reduce primary osteoporotic fracture. Third, fall prevention by
improving public awareness of its risk factor, such as sarcopenia.

 Fourth, reducing re-fracture rate by promoting fracture liaison
services (FLSs) [33]. Fifth, early detection of osteoporosis by bone
densitometry screening under the trained professionals. Sixth,
promote the proper use of antiosteoporosis drug with adequate
adherence, which is currently underuse. Seventh, use of generic
drug as the first line regimen if considering the cost of treatment.
Eighth, nationwide reimbursement of FLS should be encouraged.
Ninth, supportive patient group and volunteer in promoting oste-
oporosis prevention and treatment. Tenth, international coopera-
tion should be enhanced to advance the osteoporosis management.
There are several strengths in the study. The last projection or
modelling for the number of hip fractures in Asia was more than 20
years ago, thus, using the recent available information of age- and
sex-specific incidence of hip fractures provide a more accurate es-
timate. Second, the study was conducted by the investigators from
the 11 Asian regions or countries (members of the AFOS), thus the
study represented the current situation and perspective from these
Asian regions. Nevertheless, there are limitations. There were only a
point incidence of fractures, therefore secular changes in incidence
of hip fracture were not accounted for in the current study, and the
changes in the total number of fractures are merely based on the
changes in population demographics. In addition, the predicted
medical cost was estimated based on data published years ago,
therefore it was not accounted for the changes in medical cost as
well. However, a recent Korean study [13] showing that the average
treatment cost decreased slightly by 2% from 2007 (USD 1520.7) to
2011 (USD 1490.1). Therefore, it is expected that the medical cost
should not have big changes over time in developed countries.
In conclusion, the number of hip fracture is expected to increase
substantially between 2018 and 2050 based on predicted changes
in population demographics in Asian countries. Furthermore, more
than USD 10 billion will be spent on the direct medical cost of hip
fracture each year in Asia by 2050, assuming the cost of hip fracture
treatment is unchanged. These data should make reduction of hip
fracture being considered as a top health priority in Asian countries,
so as to reduce the burden to the individual and healthcare system.
