IMPORTANCE Rates of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) have markedly increased
but we know little about the influence of surgeons on variability of the procedure in the
community.
OBJECTIVE To quantify the influence of the attending surgeon on rates of CPM and clinician
attitudes that explained it.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this population-based survey study, we identified
7810 women with stages 0 to II breast cancer treated in 2013 to 2015 through the
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries of Georgia and Los Angeles County.
Surveys were sent approximately 2 months after surgery. Surveys were also sent to 488
attending surgeons identified by the patients.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We conducted multilevel analyses to examine the impact of
surgeon influence on variations in patient receipt of CPM using information from patient and
surgeon surveys merged to Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data.
RESULTS A total of 5080 women responded to the survey (70% response rate), and 377
surgeons responded (77% response rate). The mean (SD) age of responding women was 61.9
(11) years; 28% had an increased risk of second primary cancer, and 16% received CPM. Half
of surgeons (52%) practiced for more than 20 years and 30% treated more than 50 new
patients with breast cancer annually. Attending surgeon explained a large amount (20%) of
the variation in CPM, controlling for patient factors. The odds of a patient receiving CPM
increased almost 3-fold (odds ratio, 2.8; 95% CI, 2.1-3.4) if she saw a surgeon with a practice
approach 1 SD above a surgeon with the mean CPM rate (independent of age, diagnosis date,
BRCA status, and risk of second primary). One-quarter (25%) of the surgeon influence was
explained by attending attitudes about initial recommendations for surgery and responses to
patient requests for CPM. The estimated rate of CPM was 34% for surgeons who least favored
initial breast conservation and were least reluctant to perform CPM vs 4% for surgeons who
most favored initial breast conservation and were most reluctant to perform CPM.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, attending surgeons exerted influence on the
likelihood of receipt of CPM after a breast cancer diagnosis. Variations in surgeon attitudes
about recommendations for surgery and response to patient requests for CPM explain a
substantial amount of this influence.

 U
se of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) for
the treatment of breast cancer has increased mark-
edly over the last decade in the wake of greater pa-
tient awareness of the procedure. Currently, about 20% of
patients receive CPM, representing about half of those who get
any mastectomy, and rates vary markedly by region and age.1-3
Surgeons play a dominant role in advising patients newly di-
agnosed as having breast cancer regarding their locoregional
treatment decisions.1 Virtually all patients with curable dis-
ease see a surgeon and most patients are treated by the first
surgeon they see. About two-thirds of patients diagnosed as
having breast cancer receive a recommendation for initial
breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy from their sur-
geon, and virtually all receive the recommended treatment.4
Similarly, when a surgeon recommends against CPM, few pa-
tients undergo the procedure.1
Consensus statements by professional associations rein-
force that CPM should be considered in patients at higher risk
for second primary breast cancer but discouraged in those who
are at average risk.5-7 Despite this, only about a third of pa-
tients at average risk of a second primary who desired CPM re-
portedarecommendationfromtheirsurgeondiscouragingit.1,8
Patients with the same risk for contralateral breast cancer may
take in very different information and recommendations re-
garding CPM depending on which surgeon they see. How-
ever, to our knowledge, no published study has examined the
influence of the attending surgeon on variations in receipt of
CPM. Do patients with the same attributes get different treat-
ment depending on which surgeon they see? What surgeon at-
titudes influence this potential variability? To address these
questions, we used information from a large diverse contem-
porary sample of patients newly diagnosed as having breast
cancer and their attending surgeons to examine the influence
of individual surgeons on the receipt of CPM.
Methods
Patient Sample and Data Collection
The iCanCare study identified women with early-stage breast
cancer who were aged 20 to 79 years, diagnosed as having duc-
tal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast cancer, and reported
to the Georgia or Los Angeles County Surveillance, Epidemi-
ology, and End Results registry. Surveys were sent approxi-
mately 2 months after surgical treatment between July 2013
andAugust2015.Exclusionsincludedpriorbreastcancer,stage
III/IV disease, tumors larger than 5 cm, or more than 3 posi-
tive lymph nodes. Patients were mailed materials and a $20
cash gift. We used a modified Dillman method to encourage
response (median [SD] time from diagnosis to survey comple-
tion, 6 [2.8] months). We sent surveys to 7810 patients: 507
women were ineligible because they had exclusions previ-
ouslynoted;weredeceased,institutionalized,ortooilltocom-
plete; or unable to complete a survey in Spanish or English.
The survey was completed by 5080 of the eligible patients
(70%) and linked to Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Re-
sults data. The study protocol was approved by the Univer-
sity of Michigan, the University of Southern California, Emory
University, and state health departments. We received a waiver
of written informed consent, as participation in the survey
study was considered adequate informed consent after pa-
tients received detailed information about the study, ben-
efits and risks, and their rights as a participant.

period(N = 488)and377completedthem(responserate,77%).
Merged Sample
We linked 3727 respondent patients with unilateral disease to
366 respondent surgeons. Of these, 116 patients were missing
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data about stage
or unilateral vs bilateral disease. Of the remaining observa-
tions, 93% were complete in the variables we included in our
analyses: 3353 women with stage 0 to II breast cancer, with-
out bilateral disease, and 349 surgeons. On average, there were
9.6 patients per surgeon (range, 1-72) (Table).
Measures
The dependent variable was patient report of receipt of CPM.
Patientcovariatesconsideredincludedage,riskofasecondpri-
mary breast cancer (following National Comprehensive Can-
cer Network guidelines on risk of breast cancer pathologic mu-
tation based on patient age, detailed family history of cancer,
and tumor characteristics),1,9,10 and a variable indicating pa-
tient report of genetic testing results (BRCA). We also in-
cluded geographic location and the date of diagnosis because
both variables have a strong association with CPM receipt.
Surgeon variables considered included (1) a unique sur-
geon identifier, (2) report of the annual volume of newly di-
agnosed breast cancer cases treated, (3) age, (4) years in prac-
tice, and (5) sex. We hypothesized that surgeon differences in
how strongly they favored initial breast conservation and how
reluctant they were to perform CPM if asked by the patient
might explain some of the differences in whether patients re-
ceived CPM. We developed 2 scales based on response to items
in a scenario of a patient with localized disease and no obvi-
ous contraindications to breast conservation: a 55-year-old
woman with no family history of breast cancer and normal
Key Points
Question How much does the attending surgeon influence
variation in receipt of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy
(CPM) in the community?
Findings This population-based survey study found that the
attending surgeon explained 20% of the variation in CPM. The
estimated rate of CPM was 34% for surgeons who least favored
initial breast conservation and were least reluctant to perform
CPM vs 4% for surgeons who most favored initial breast
conservation and were most reluctant to perform CPM.
Meaning Attending surgeons exert strong influence on the
likelihood of receipt of CPM after diagnosis of breast cancer.

 screening mammogram. In this case, bilateral screening ul-
trasonography showed a 1.2-cm solid mass, and a core biopsy
demonstrated infiltrating ductal carcinoma; estrogen recep-
tor expression, 95%; progesterone receptor expression, 90%;
and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative.
The first scale (favor initial breast conservation scale) was
derived from 4 separate items: surgeons were asked (based on
the scenario) if they would recommend breast-conserving sur-
gery, unilateral mastectomy, bilateral mastectomy, or against
CPM (4-point response categories for each item, from defi-
nitelyyestodefinitelyno).Theitemswerescaledsothatahigher
score indicated favoring initial breast conservation. The sec-
ond scale (reluctance to perform CPM if requested scale) was
derived from responses to the question in the clinical sce-
nario, “why might you perform bilateral mastectomy if re-
questedbyyourpatientslikethis?”ReasonsforperformingCPM
included (1) giving patients greater peace of mind, (2) improv-
ing cosmetic outcomes, (3) avoiding conflict with patient,
(4) avoiding losing patient to another surgeon, (5) avoiding the
need for surveillance, (6) improving long-term quality of life,
(7) reducing recurrence of invasive disease, and (8) improving
survival. Each item included a 5-point response category, from
very likely to not likely. The items were scaled so that a higher
score represented more reluctance to perform CPM.
Both scales were developed using a partial credit item re-
sponse model that allows the different items to have different
thresholdsfortheresponsesandtreatsthemasnominal,sothat
theresponseordercanbetested.11Thestandardizedlatentscale

if requested had a reliability from 0.66 to 0.87 over the range of
the response data and was similarly standardized.
Statistical Analysis
We first described the distribution of the patient and surgeon
characteristics, the distribution of responses to the items that
comprise the 2 surgeon scales, and distribution and correla-
tion of the estimated underlying surgeon scale scores. The pri-
mary analysis was a multilevel logistic regression model with
the surgeon identifier code defining the second level and the
patient as the primary unit of observation.12 Our base model
included higher risk of second primary breast cancer or known
BRCA mutation (clinical factors for which guidelines recom-
mend consideration of CPM), patient age (may capture some
of the difference in patient demand for surgery faced by a sur-
geon and which is strongly associated with CPM), and date of
diagnosis.Wecalculatedthesurgeon-levelvariationinthebase
model after adjusting for our baseline patient predictors. Our
second model step included the set of surgeon predictors pre-
viously described. Only our 2 scale measures are shown in the
model output as the other measures had small effect sizes and
were not significant. We display the marginal effects of the 2
surgeon attitudes scale scores on the probability that a woman
receivesCPMaveragedacrossthebaselinesetofcovariatesand
the remaining effects attributable to the surgeons for the
sample of women. Finally, in our third model step, geo-
graphic site was included because we had noted large site dif-
ferences in rates of CPM and wanted to quantify the degree to
which the surgeon differences were attributable to a system-
atic difference in practice across geographic area as opposed
to individual surgeon-level variability with geographic area.

against it (76%) (Figure 1). There was wide variability with re-

The distribution of items used in creating the 2 scales is shown. Both sets of
items were elicited in response from 370 surgeons with complete information
to a scenario involving a 55-year-old woman with no family history of breast
cancer and a normal screening mammogram. Bilateral screening
ultrasonography shows a 1.2-cm solid mass and core biopsy demonstrates
classic infiltrating ductal carcinoma, estrogen receptor expression, 95%;
progesterone receptor expression, 90%; and human epidermal growth factor

about 6 (6.2 [95% CI, 3.3-11.8] in model 1 to 5.8 [95% CI, 3.1-
10.8] in model 3) for CPM receipt when the women reported
being mutation positive, and this estimate was omitted from
Figure 3 so that the other odds ratios are better compared (odds

Age was one of the strongest predictors after BRCA sta-
tus, with a 50% reduction in odds of CPM for each decade in-
creaseinage.Overall,model1predictedCPMwell,withanarea
under the curve of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.83-0.86), and the model
explains 35% of the variability in the likelihood of CPM. Pa-
tient factors explained about 15% of the variability in the like-
lihoodofCPM,butthesurgeonidentifierbyitselfexplainseven
more, about 20% of the variance. The odds of a patient receiv-
ing CPM would increase 2.8-fold (95% CI, 2.1-3.4) if she were
to see a surgeon with a practice approach 1 SD above a sur-
geon with the mean CPM rate (independent of age, date of di-
agnosis, BRCA status, and risk of recurrence). In model 2, we
added the 2 surgeon scale scores for favor initial breast con-
servation and reluctance to perform CPM. Both substantially
decreased the odds of receipt of CPM (adjusted odds ratios, 0.7
[95% CI, 0.6-0.8] and 0.6 [95% CI, 0.5-0.8] per SD, respec-
tively) and explain 25% of the surgeon influence. Finally, in
model 3, we added patient geographic site, which is highly cor-
related with receipt of CPM: patients in Los Angeles County

 are much less likely to have received CPM (odds ratio, 0.5; 95%
CI, 0.3-0.6) and the variable explains a quarter of the remain-
ing surgeon effect.
Figure 4 shows the independent effects of both attitude
scales on rates of CPM in the population in model 2. The prob-
abilities estimated the effect of changing the scale values in
the population averaging over all the other variables and re-
maining surgeon variation. The x-axis represents the score for
the reluctance to do CPM scale (from least to most reluctant
surgeons). The modifiers “most,” “more,” “less,” and “least”
refer to 1 or 2 SDs on either side of the mean (average) scale
score in our population of surgeons. The y-axis shows the ex-
pected CPM rate. The vertical lines indicate the effect of dif-
ferent reluctance scale scores on the favor initial breast-
conservationscale(least,average,andmostfavoringsurgeons).
For example, 13% was the mean rate of CPM for a surgeon who
had mean scores for both scale scores. But there was a wide
variation in CPM rates based on variation in these scale lev-
els. At the extreme, the rate of CPM was 34% for surgeons who
least favored initial breast conservation and were least reluc-
tant to perform CPM. By contrast, the estimated rate was 4%
for surgeons who most favored initial breast conservation and
were most reluctant to perform CPM.
Discussion
In our study, we observed an influence of the attending sur-
geon on whether a patient undergoes CPM after diagnosis of
unilateral breast cancer. The individual attending surgeon
explained a large amount (20%) of the overall variation in
CPM use in this large diverse population-based patient
sample, after adjusting for factors that determine the risk of
second primary breast cancer and age, one of the major
determinants of CPM. Surgeon attitudes about the approach
to initial surgery or response to patient requests for CPM
explained about a quarter of this surgeon effect. In a sce-
nario of a typical patient with no contraindications to breast
conservation and at average risk for a second primary can-
cer, most surgeons favored an initial breast-conservation
approach and most would recommend against CPM. There
was less consensus about the willingness to perform CPM if
requested by the patient. We observed a range of reasons
why a surgeon would be willing to perform CPM if asked:
give peace of mind, yield better cosmetic outcomes, avoid
conflict with patient, reduce need for surveillance, improve
long-term quality of life, reduce recurrence of invasive dis-
ease, avoid losing patient to another surgeon, or improve
survival (in order of endorsement). Both of the attitudes
scales independently affected the likelihood that a patient
would get CPM. This varied from 34% for the (relatively
rare) attending surgeon who least favored initial beast
conservation and was least reluctant to perform CPM if
asked, to 4% for the surgeon who strongly favored initial
breast conservation and was most reluctant to perform CPM
if asked.
We also examined pertinent patient factors. Contralat-
eral prophylactic mastectomy was correlated with guideline-
concordant clinical factors (elevated risk of genetic mutation
or BRCA mutation on testing) and patient age, which may
reflect physician and/or patient views that CPM is an increas-
ingly more relevant alternative the younger the age at onset
of breast cancer. Finally, the geographic location variable
explained some of the remaining surgeon variation, suggest-
ing at least some regional surgeon peer effects and poten-
tially a regional difference in patient population attitudes
toward CPM.
Prior literature has demonstrated the marked increase in
receipt of CPM after diagnosis of breast cancer and underly-
ingfactorsdrivingthetrend(dominantlygreaterpatientaware-
ness and interest for the procedure).2,13-18 More recent re-
search has shown that surgeon recommendation against CPM
reduces receipt. But only about one-third of patients who con-
sider CPM report that their surgeon recommended against it
and one-third reported no substantial discussion with their
surgeon about it.1,8 However, to our knowledge, our study is
the first to estimate how much the likelihood of a woman re-
ceiving CPM varies across surgeon.
Strengths and Limitations
Aspects of the study merit comment. We used a large popu-
lation-based contemporary diverse patient sample with a high
response rate. Virtually all patients identified their attending
surgeon and surgeon survey response was high. The mea-
sures were highly relevant to clinical practice and the meth-
ods were appropriate to the research questions and study de-
sign. However, there were some weaknesses. Despite high

surgeons in our sample is shown. On the x-axis are the levels of the reluctance
to perform CPM scale, with the descriptors least, less, average, more, and most
referring to −2, −1, 0, 1, or 2 SDs around the mean scale score for the population,
respectively. The 3 lines represent 2 SDs below to 2 SDs above the mean scale
score on the favor breast conservation scale. The y-axis shows the expected
mean rate of CPM in the population from which we sampled, if the entire
population were treated by a surgeon at any of the specified levels of the
2 scales. The estimates are averaged over BRCA status, risk of second primary
breast cancer, patient age, date of diagnosis, and the residual surgeon
differences (eg, these are marginal predictions).

given the requirement for completed surveys from both the
surgeon and the patient. Finally, the findings were limited to
large regions of the country.
Conclusions
Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy represents an impor-
tant paradox in cancer management. There has been a sea
change in clinician attitudes about the approach to manage-
ment of curable breast cancer favoring less-extensive locore-
gional approaches. Yet, rates of CPM have increased over the
last decade largely owing to greater patient awareness and
interest in the procedure. In this context, we found that the
attending surgeon explains more of the variation in CPM
than patient clinical factors. Surgeon attitudes about the
options for initial surgery and their reactions to patient
requests for treatment influence whether a patient with
similar attributes receives CPM. These attitudes could shape
the course of the discussion about treatment with patients
by influencing the strength to which a surgeon (1) endorses
breast conservation as the initial surgery option, (2) feels
compelled to discuss the details of CPM as a possible treat-
ment alternative, or (3) tries to discourage a woman from
CPM as a treatment. Our findings motivate the need to help
surgeons address this growing clinical conundrum in the
examination room. This has already begun as oncology sur-
geon associations revise and promote clearer guidelines
about CPM.5,6 Our findings reinforce the need to address bet-
ter ways to communicate with patients with regard to their
beliefs about the benefits of more extensive surgery and
their reactions to the management plan including surgeon
training and deployment of decision aids.
