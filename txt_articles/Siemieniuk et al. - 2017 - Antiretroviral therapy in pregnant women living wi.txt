RAPID RECOMMENDATIONS
Approximately 1.4 million women living with HIV 
become pregnant every year. Most women use 
antiretroviral therapy, to reduce the risk of vertical 
transmission or for personal health reasons. Using 
the GRADE framework according to the BMJ Rapid 
Recommendation process, we make recommenda-
tions for optimal choice of combination antiretroviral 
regimen considering patient values and preferences, 
the balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes, 
their uncertainty, and practical issues. We suggest a 
zidovudine and lamivudine-based regimen over one 
that includes tenofovir or emtricitabine (weak rec-
ommendation). We recommend alternatives over the 
combination of tenofovir, emtricitabine, and lopina-
vir/ritonavir (strong recommendation).
The use of the most common combination antiretroviral 
medicines in pregnancy was questioned when the results 
of the Promoting Maternal and Infant Survival Everywhere 
(PROMISE) trial were published in late 2016.1 The primary 
efficacy outcome demonstrated that two common com-
bination antiretroviral therapy regimens confer similar 
reductions in vertical HIV transmission compared with 
zidovudine (AZT) monotherapy. However, a planned anal-
ysis of a composite safety outcome raised the possibility 
that the combination regimen with tenofovir plus emtricit-
abine (FTC) may increase early prematurity, stillbirth, and 
neonatal death compared with zidovudine plus lamivu-
dine when combined with ritonavir-boosted lopinavir.1 We 
aimed to appraise the totality of evidence about combina-
tion antiretroviral therapy for pregnant women infected 
with HIV and make women-centred recommendations.
Every year, about 1.4 million women living with HIV 
become pregnant and 1.1 million pregnant women use 
antiretroviral therapy.2 Without any intervention, approxi-
mately 15-45% of children born to mothers with HIV acquire 
HIV in the antenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum periods.3
Women may be offered antiretroviral therapy while 
pregnant to prevent vertical transmission4 and, in 
some cases, to reduce the maternal risk of AIDS defin-
ing events.5 Combination antiretroviral therapy is the 
most effective among several options to reduce the risk 
of vertical transmission. Many of these options can be 
implemented simultaneously (box 1). They have different 
burdens and adverse effects.
Maternal combination antiretroviral therapy, when initi-
ated before the third trimester, confers a vertical transmis-
sion rate of less than 5 per 1000 births.7 Most combination 
antiretroviral therapy regimens include a “backbone” of 
two nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibi-
tors (NRTIs) in combination with a third antiretroviral, 
often with a different mechanism of action.8-10
Major guidelines currently recommend the NRTI combi-
nation of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine 
as a first line therapy in pregnant women (table 1). For 
simplicity, we refer to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate as 
tenofovir, recognising that the discussion may not apply 
to the related agent tenofovir alafenamide. Tenofovir is 
usually combined with emtricitabine and is currently 
the most widely used antiretroviral worldwide (fig 1). In 
2016, revenues from tenofovir and tenofovir-containing 
products reached US$13bn (approximately £10bn).16
Some antiretrovirals, including tenofovir and lamivu-
dine, also have activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV). 
HBV infection is common among women with HIV, espe-
cially in women born in areas where HBV is endemic.17 
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
•   
The guideline panel make a weak 
recommendation for zidovudine and 
lamivudine instead of tenofovir or 
emtricitabine for pregnant women living 
with HIV when they are combined with most 
antiretrovirals, and a strong recommendation 
when these drugs are combined with 
lopinavir/ritonavir
•   
Tenofovir and emtricitabine probably increase 
the risk of early neonatal death and preterm 
delivery <34 weeks compared with zidovudine 
and lamivudine; this is more certain when 
they are combined with lopinavir/ritonavir
•   
Almost all women place an extremely high 
value on avoiding early neonatal deaths, 
and most do not consider pill burden very 
important in pregnancy
•   
Women with active hepatitis B and high risk 
of vertical hepatitis B transmission, severe 
anaemia, drug allergies or intolerances, 
or zidovudine or lamivudine resistant 
HIV or hepatitis B may be more likely to 
choose treatment based on tenofovir and 
emtricitabine
•   
Recommendations that take a public health 
perspective (rather than an individual patient 
perspective) need to consider resource use 
and might make different recommendations 
based on the same evidence

RAPID RECOMMENDATIONS
Vertical transmission of HBV occurs in approximately 
38% of children born to mothers with active HBV infec-
tion in settings where prophylactic measures are not 
available.18 The transmission rate is reduced to about 
1% in children who receive prophylaxis with hepatitis 
B immunoglobulin and early hepatitis B vaccination.19 
When transmission does occur, it is almost always in the 
minority of mothers with high HBV disease activity—such 
as a detectable serum hepatitis B envelope antigen (found 
in the early phase of infection) or high HBV viral load (>1 
million copies/mL).19 20
The evidence
To inform the recommendations, the panel requested two 
systematic reviews, which are linked to this publication 
(see linked articles in this cluster) on the following ques-
tions:
•   
What are the relative benefits and harms of different 
NRTI regimens for pregnant women with HIV?21
•   
What evidence describes the values and preferences 
of women considering antiretroviral therapy?22
Understanding the recommendation
Benefit and harm
The most credible and relevant evidence comes from 
the PROMISE study, which randomised 816 women 
from Africa, who were at least 14 weeks pregnant, to 
tenofovir/emtricitabine or zidovudine/lamivudine.1 Both 
groups also received the protease inhibitor combination 
of lopinavir/ritonavir at a standard dose until the third 
trimester, when the dose was increased by 50% until 
delivery. Fig 2 shows details of the study and character-
istics of included patients.
Based on the linked systematic review,21 the panel 
judged that there was moderate certainty that tenofovir/
emtricitabine—when combined with lopinavir/ritonavir 
in the doses used in the PROMISE trial—increases still-
birth and early neonatal mortality compared with zido-
vudine/lamivudine, as well as early premature labour 
before 34 weeks gestational age (see infographic). Cer-
tainty is moderate rather than high because of impre-
cision around the best estimate of the absolute effect 
and because most of the evidence comes from a single 
study where the event rate in the zidovudine/lamivudine 
arm may have been lower than expected.1 The authors 
of the PROMISE trial argued that the event rate in the 
zidovudine/lamivudine arm might have been lower than 
expected because of “some unknown confounder” that 
resulted in fewer early premature deliveries and early 
infant deaths in the zidovudine/lamivudine arm during 
the second phase of the study when tenofovir/emtricit-
abine was available—and that the confounder was not 
present before the introduction of the tenofovir/emtric-
itabine arm.1 The panel think this is unlikely, and, even 
if there was an unknown confounder in the study, until 
that confounder is identified, the risk estimates apply to 
all pregnant women living with HIV. The available evi-
dence suggested that there was no difference for any of 
the other pre-specified outcomes (low to moderate cer-
tainty; see infographic).

RAPID RECOMMENDATIONS
ritonavir dose used in the third trimester in the P 
ROMISE 
study provided serum drug concentrations similar to 
those of non-pregnant women taking the typical dose,24 
although some experts argue that no dose increase is 
required during pregnancy.25 For combinations with a 
third antiretroviral agent other than lopinavir/ritonavir, 
the best evidence informing the comparison of tenofovir/
emtricitabine versus alternative NRTIs is therefore indi-
rect because the best evidence comes almost entirely 
from a study that used lopinavir/ritonavir. In this circum-
stance, certainty in the evidence was rated down from 
moderate to low for several key outcomes, including still-
birth and early neonatal death.
Whether the culprit medication is tenofovir or emtric-
itabine, and the circumstances in which an increase in 
stillbirths and neonatal death occurs, remain uncertain. 
Some evidence from observational studies might suggest 
that tenofovir/emtricitabine is safe in pregnancy.8 26 How-
ever, in addition to the inevitable residual confounding 
inherent to observational studies,27 the available stud-
ies also failed to adjust for important confounders, had 
inconsistent results, and their pooled estimate of effect 
was imprecise.21 The observational evidence thus pro-
vides only very low certainty evidence and does not 
provide reassurance that tenofovir/emtricitabine is safe 
in pregnancy. Indeed, even adequately powered obser-
vational studies that control for known and measurable 
confounders would be unlikely to provide adequate 
assurance of safety in the face of the current randomised 
trial evidence suggesting harm.
Hepatitis B co-infection—Tenofovir and lamivudine 
both have antiviral activity against HBV. In the linked 
network meta-analysis, there was no apparent difference 
between tenofovir and lamivudine for preventing verti-
cal transmission of hepatitis B, but the certainty is low 
because there were very few patients and events in the 
single randomised controlled trial with tenofovir.21 The 
impact of tenofovir compared with lamivudine on the risk 
of antiviral resistance and flares in hepatitis B disease is 
uncertain in this context.
Practical issues
Tenofovir/emtricitabine (as well as abacavir/lamivudine) 
are typically administered once per day, whereas zidovu-
dine/lamivudine is administered twice daily. Antiretrovi-
rals are often co-formulated into single tablets for ease of 
administration in an attempt to optimise adherence. Ten-
ofovir/emtricitabine and abacavir/lamivudine are avail-
able as co-formulations with several other antiretrovirals 
in single once daily tablets (tenofovir/emtricitabine is 
co-formulated with efavirenz, rilpivirine, or elvitegravir/
cobicistat); zidovudine/lamivudine is not co-formulated 
into any single once daily tablets, and is instead available 
in a single tablet co-formulated with abacavir to be taken 
twice per day. Therefore, tenofovir based regimens may be 
simpler than zidovudine/lamivudine based combination 
antiretroviral therapy (see fig 3).
Values and preferences
Our linked systematic review of qualitative studies report 
several consistent themes that are important or very 
NRTIs are often combined with antiretrovirals other 
than lopinavir/ritonavir (table 1). It is possible but 
unlikely that a drug-drug interaction between lopinavir/
ritonavir and tenofovir contributed to the increase in 
infant mortality. When tenofovir and lopinavir/ritonavir 
are used together, serum lopinavir/ritonavir concen-
trations are not increased and tenofovir levels are only 
marginally increased (much less than normal variation 
between patients).23 Moreover, the increased lopinavir/
HOW THE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE CREATED
This independent international panel included women living 
with HIV, adult and paediatric infectious disease specialists, 
general practitioners, paediatricians, obstetricians, a 
hepatologist, a pharmacist, and research methodologists 
(see appendix 1 on bmj.com for list of panel members). 
Panel members were recruited based on their work on 
the topic, with the focus on achieving a balanced panel 
representing all viewpoints. No person had any financial 
conflicts of interest; intellectual and professional conflicts 
were minimal (see appendix 2 on bmj.com).
The panel followed the BMJ Rapid Recommendations 
process for creating a trustworthy recommendation, such 
as using the GRADE approach to evaluate the evidence 
and create recommendations (appendix 3).31-35 The panel 
considered the typical and expected variation in patient 
values and preferences, the balance of benefits, harms and 
burdens of the combination antiretroviral regimens, the 
quality of the evidence for each outcome, and treatment 
acceptability. With GRADE, recommendations can be strong 
or weak.36 37 Weak recommendations imply that there 
is likely to be variation in what informed patients would 
choose, thus emphasising the need for an explicit shared 
decision-making process between patient and healthcare 
provider.

RAPID RECOMMENDATIONS
simplifying the combination antiretroviral therapy dosing 
regimen from twice daily to once daily.22 Thus our recom-
mendations apply to women who share these values.
Practical advice
Empowering women
The recommendations are meant to support shared deci-
sion making between pregnant women and their healthcare 
provider. Healthcare providers should make all necessary 
efforts to inform women of all of the benefits and harms for 
all reasonable treatment options. The linked decision aids, 
available through MagicApp can help facilitate this conversa-
tion (www.magicapp.org/goto/guideline/VLpr5E). Patient 
support organisations can also play a critical role in patient 
education.
important to women when considering combination 
antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy.22 These themes 
concur with the experience of those panellists living with 
HIV, as well as the healthcare worker panellists’ observa-
tions from interactions with patients.
Women described a strong desire to optimise the 
health of their child. This desire encouraged mothers to 
use antiretroviral therapy to reduce vertical HIV trans-
mission, but also proved a barrier for some because of 
concerns about adverse effects on the child.22 More 
specifically, almost all women place an extremely high 
value on avoiding stillbirth and neonatal mortality, and 
most women place a very high or extremely high value 
on avoiding early preterm labour. With some exceptions, 
women probably place little or very little importance on

RAPID RECOMMENDATIONS
tions based on the same evidence. Many HIV treatment 
programmes, especially in low resource settings, are 
underfunded and have difficulty meeting antiretroviral 
therapy demand. In some situations, these operational 
pressures have been partially alleviated by simplifying 
the treatment regimen to be used as first line therapy for 
all patients, including women with HIV who are preg-
nant or who may be expected to become pregnant. The 
2016 WHO guidelines explicitly state that “simplifying 
operational demands” was one reason that “the same 
once-per-day combination pill is now recommended for 
all adults”.8 The WHO currently recommends a single tab-
let combination of tenofovir/emtricitabine plus efavirenz 
as the first line combination antiretroviral therapy regi-
men for all adults.8 Recommending alternative treatment 
options for women living with HIV who are pregnant may 
introduce operational challenges. For example, many 
treatment programmes negotiate more affordable medica-
tion purchases in bulk. Other influential guidelines either 
have not yet had the opportunity to consider the evidence 
from the PROMISE trial or did not have the opportunity to 
consider the evidence systematically.9 10
Hepatitis B co-infection
In women co-infected with HBV, there is a risk that the 
HBV becomes resistant and that treatment fails, a risk that 
may be particularly important in women taking lamivudine 
for a prolonged period.32 Lamivudine may be less effective 
at preventing vertical transmission of HBV in mothers with 
lamivudine resistance than in mothers without resistance. 
However, the degree to which this is true is uncertain. In 
women with low HBV disease activity or who have access 
to neonatal hepatitis B immunoglobulin and early infant 
HBV vaccination, the risk of HBV transmission is already 
low (approximately 1 in 100), so any speculative difference 
in vertical transmission rates between tenofovir and lami-
vudine in lamivudine-resistant HBV will be small. On the 
other hand, the speculative benefit of tenofovir over lami-
vudine in preventing vertical transmission in women with 
lamivudine-resistant HBV might be larger in situations with 
a higher baseline risk of HBV transmission—particularly 
when there is high maternal HBV activity (such as >200 000 
IU/mL or 1 million copies/mL) and where there is unreliable 
infant access to hepatitis B immunoglobulin or early HBV 
vaccination.
Cost and resources
In the commonest situation, where women do not pay 
directly for antiretroviral therapy, cost is not their con-
cern. In settings where tenofovir/emtricitabine and its 
one tablet once per day combination pills remain on pat-
ent, we expect there to be considerable cost savings to the 
payer with the routine use of zidovudine/lamivudine over 
tenofovir/emtricitabine. In settings where generic teno-
fovir/emtricitabine is available and routinely prescribed, 
the impact on costs to the payer is uncertain (fig 3).
Uncertainty
There is a lack of data on the safety and efficacy of most 
commonly used combination antiretroviral therapy 
regimens in pregnant women living with HIV. To date, 
Alternative NRTIs
A reasonable NRTI backbone is zidovudine/lamivudine. 
This is because evidence from randomised controlled trials 
is directly applicable only to zidovudine/lamivudine as an 
alternative to tenofovir/emtricitabine, although other NRTI 
combinations such as abacavir/lamivudine are available.
A new formulation of tenofovir, tenofovir alafena-
mide, is now available; tenofovir alafenamide may have 
improved renal and bone safety compared with tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate in adults because of reduced plasma 
concentrations.29 In the absence of randomised trial data 
in pregnancy, whether tenofovir alafenamide and tenofovir 
disoproxil fumarate carry similar risks to the fetus is specu-
lative.
The third antiretroviral agent
Typically, a third antiretroviral is added to a dual NRTI back-
bone to complete the combination antiretroviral therapy 
regimen. A triple NRTI regimen, with zidovudine/lamivu-
dine plus abacavir, is one reasonable option, although there 
are several others. Current guidelines differ substantially 
in their recommendations for the third antiretroviral agent 
(table 1). The linked systematic review did not formally 
address the third antiretroviral agent, but evidence from a 
randomised trial of 540 pregnant women in Botswana sug-
gests that, when combined with zidovudine/lamivudine, 
abacavir might confer a lower risk of premature delivery than 
lopinavir/ritonavir (15% v 23%, but with a 95% confidence 
interval of the difference of <1% to 16%).30 Other outcomes, 
including vertical transmission of HIV, were similar between 
abacavir and lopinavir/ritonavir. The impact of other combi-
nation antiretroviral therapy regimens on key outcomes in 
pregnancy is very uncertain.
Some women may have other compelling reasons to 
choose a specific single or combination antiretroviral 
therapy regimen. The virus should be susceptible to the 
prescribed antiretrovirals. Further, specific antiretroviral 
therapy agents should be avoided if a woman is allergic, 
intolerant to side effects, or has had a serious adverse reac-
tion to that agent in the past. Abacavir should be avoided 
in women with the HLA B*5701 genotype.
Recommendations in context
The number of antiretroviral therapy options that women 
can choose from and can be prescribed varies consid-
erably throughout the world. The most widely avail-
able regimen in low resource settings is tenofovir with 
emtricitabine or lamivudine, combined with efavirenz. In 
many settings, zidovudine/lamivudine may not be avail-
able, despite it being older and generally cheaper. Our 
first recommendation can only apply to settings where 
women have access to zidovudine and lamivudine. In 
light of this evidence, healthcare administrators should 
be encouraged to prioritise making zidovudine and lami-
vudine available to pregnant women in settings where 
zidovudine/lamivudine based combination antiretroviral 
therapy regimens are not currently available.
These recommendations, like all BMJ Rapid Rec-
ommendations,31 take a patient centred perspective. 
Guidelines that take a public health perspective, such as 
the WHO guideline,8 may issue different recommenda-

RAPID RECOMMENDATIONS
most information has been gleaned from observational 
studies, rather than randomised controlled trials. Even if 
adequately powered and carefully controlled for known 
confounders, observational studies are unlikely to pro-
vide sufficient reassurance on the safety of any particu-
lar regimen when randomised trial evidence suggests 
harm—even when the randomised trial data informs 
decisions indirectly and the effect estimates are impre-
cise. Speculative arguments about antiretroviral dos-
ing, serum levels, drug interactions, and mechanisms 
that might cause antiretroviral therapy-related harm 
in pregnancy need further basic science and observa-
tional research, complemented by safety confirmation in 
r 
andomised controlled trials. The PROMISE trial serves 
as a reminder of the importance of randomised evidence 
to inform treatment options in pregnant women with 
HIV.
The outcomes reported in many of the studies were nar-
row in scope. Future studies should consider all outcomes 
important to patients—such as medium to long term 
child development. Future primary studies and second-
ary reviews must consider all reasonable and available 
interventions, including zidovudine monotherapy, not 
simply combination antiretroviral therapy.
Implementation research and efforts may be required 
to overcome the current operational challenges so that 
availability of the right choice of combination antiretro-
viral therapy is aligned with the best available evidence 
for almost all pregnant women living with HIV.

HOW PATIENTS WERE INVOLVED IN THE CREATION 
OF THIS ARTICLE
In addition to the systematic review of the values and 
preferences of women living with HIV, three women 
living with HIV were full panel members, participated 
in the teleconferences and email discussions, and met 
all authorship criteria. These panel members identified 
important outcomes, led the discussions about values and 
preferences, and helped to interpret and provide context for 
the evidence.
