Abstract
The chronic effects of repetitive head impacts (RHI) on the development of neuroinflammation and its relationship
to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) are unknown. Here we set out to determine the relationship between
RHI exposure, neuroinflammation, and the development of hyperphosphorylated tau (ptau) pathology and
dementia risk in CTE. We studied a cohort of 66 deceased American football athletes from the Boston University-
Veteran’s Affairs-Concussion Legacy Foundation Brain Bank as well as 16 non-athlete controls. Subjects with a
neurodegenerative disease other than CTE were excluded. Counts of total and activated microglia, astrocytes, and
ptau pathology were performed in the dorsolateral frontal cortex (DLF). Binary logistic and simultaneous equation
regression models were used to test associations between RHI exposure, microglia, ptau pathology, and dementia.
Duration of RHI exposure and the development and severity of CTE were associated with reactive microglial
morphology and increased numbers of CD68 immunoreactive microglia in the DLF. A simultaneous equation
regression model demonstrated that RHI exposure had a significant direct effect on CD68 cell density (p < 0.0001)
and ptau pathology (p < 0.0001) independent of age at death. The effect of RHI on ptau pathology was partially
mediated through increased CD68 positive cell density. A binary logistic regression demonstrated that a diagnosis
of dementia was significantly predicted by CD68 cell density (OR = 1.010, p = 0.011) independent of age (OR = 1.055,
p = 0.007), but this effect disappeared when ptau pathology was included in the model. In conclusion, RHI is
associated with chronic activation of microglia, which may partially mediate the effect of RHI on the development
of ptau pathology and dementia in CTE. Inflammatory molecules may be important diagnostic or predictive
biomarkers as well as promising therapeutic targets in CTE.

Introduction
Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive
neurodegenerative disease associated with a prolonged his-
tory of repetitive head impacts (RHI) including concussive
and subconcussive hits [1, 2]. Athletes participating in
sports such as American football, hockey, boxing, soccer,
and rugby, as well as military personnel, may be at risk due
to years of exposure to head impacts [1, 2]. The clinical fea-
tures of CTE typically manifest years or decades after
exposure to RHI and consist of impairments in mood, be-
havior, cognition, and motor functioning [3]. Recently, con-
sensus criteria have established CTE as a distinct tauopathy
defined by abnormally phosphorylated tau (ptau) accumula-
tion within neurons, astrocytes, and cell processes in an ir-
regular and patchy distribution that is perivascular and
concentrated within the depths of sulci [4]. The earliest
pathological changes of CTE are often observed within the
sulcal depths of the dorsolateral frontal cortex. In later,

 more severe stages, ptau pathology is present within neigh-
boring cortical regions and within medial temporal lobe
structures such as the hippocampus [4, 5].
Growing evidence suggests that cumulative RHI exposure
is associated with the development and increased severity
of CTE [3, 5–8]. We have previously shown in a heteroge-
neous cohort of deceased contact sport athletes and mili-
tary personnel that the number of years of exposure to RHI
significantly predicts increased CTE stage as defined by the
extent of ptau pathology [5, 9]. Furthermore, a cumulative
head impact index based on position, level of play, and im-
pact frequencies from helmet accelerometer studies in
American football players was associated with later-life cog-
nitive and neurobehavioral impairment [8]. In contrast, the
reported number of concussions was not significantly cor-
related with CTE stage [5, 9] and was less predictive than
the cumulative head impact index of cognitive and neuro-
behavioral impairment [8]. Furthermore, 16 % of individ-
uals diagnosed with CTE had no reported history of
concussions suggesting subconcussive hits are sufficient for
the development of the disease [10]. However, to date, an
association between years of contact sports play and a
quantitative measure of ptau pathology in the brain has not
been shown, and the underlying factors linking RHI expos-
ure to the development of CTE are unknown.
Although mild traumatic brain injury has been associ-
ated with multifocal axonal loss and microglial activation
[1], the factors that initiate the development of ptau
pathology are unknown. While the neuroinflammatory
response to mild acute insults is usually short-lived [11,
12], RHI may lead to chronic neuroinflammation that in-
duces a self-perpetuating inflammatory cycle with long-
standing activation of microglia, including sustained
release of inflammatory mediators [13]. Recent evidence
suggests that neuroinflammatory cytokines and reactive
microglia exacerbate tau pathology and contribute to the
spreading of ptau in rodent models of Alzheimer disease
and other tauopathies, suggesting a potential link be-
tween traumatic brain injury and CTE [14, 15]. However,
the neuroinflammatory state years after a period of RHI
is unknown.
Here, we test the hypothesis that increased neuroin-
flammation, defined by an increased astrocyte and
microglial number and an upregulation of the inflamma-
tory/phagocytic marker CD68, is associated with a his-
tory of longer exposure to RHI, increased CTE ptau
pathology, and increased risk of developing dementia in
a cohort of American football players and non-exposed
control subjects.
Materials and methods
Subjects
A total of 66 brains from former American football
players with a history of RHI from the VA-BU-CLF Brain
Bank were neuropathologically evaluated for the changes
of CTE, as well as other neurodegenerative conditions
using previously published selection criteria and proto-
cols [16]. Subjects were selected from the entire 297
subjects who had donated to the brain bank based on
the following criteria: 124 subjects were excluded due to
carrying a neuropathological diagnosis of either Alzhei-
mer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Dementia with Lewy
bodies, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, or motor
neuron disease; an additional 65 subjects lacked any his-
tory of playing American football and were removed; 10
subjects were excluded for no having documentation of
the length of contact sport exposure; 30 subjects did not
have sufficient DLF tissue for analysis; 2 subjects were
excluded due to a gunshot wound through the tissue
preventing proper analysis. All cases selected were male.
Sixteen additional brains from non-athlete controls were
obtained from the Framingham Heart Study. Subjects
were selected as controls based on their lack of history
of contact sport play and lack of neurodegenerative dis-
ease other than CTE (however, no subjects without a
history of contact sports play had CTE). Clinical assess-
ment details are provided below. Next of kin provided
written consent for participation and brain donation.
IRB approval for brain donation was obtained through
the Boston University Alzheimer's Disease Center (BU
ADC) and CTE Center and Edith Nourse Rogers Me-
morial Veterans Hospital, Bedford, MA. Of the 66
former American football players, 18 players were found
to have no neurodegenerative pathology after compre-
hensive neuropathological examination and were desig-
nated “RHI with no CTE” and 48 players were diagnosed
with CTE using recently published NINDS criteria for
neuropathologic diagnosis of CTE [5]. Of the subjects
with CTE, 13 subjects were diagnosed with stage I or II
CTE (Mild CTE) using the McKee staging criteria [5]
and 35 subjects were diagnosed with stage III or IV CTE
(Severe CTE). Table 1 contains exposure characteristics
for each group.
Clinical assessment
Institutional Review Board approval for post-mortem clin-
ical record review, interviews with family members, and
neuropathological evaluation was obtained through Boston
University School of Medicine. RHI history, concussive
events, athletic or military service history, history of cogni-
tive, mood, and behavior changes, and clinical status lead-
ing up to death were assessed with post-mortem interviews
with informants and through online surveys and medical
record review as described previously [16]. RHI exposure
was defined by the total numbers of years football was
played. All interviews were performed by neurologists and
neuropsychologists trained to assess for RHI exposure and
neurodegenerative diseases. To obtain additional clinical

was
performed.
Through the above methods, age of cognitive, behavior, and
mood symptom onset were ascertained [16]. Presence of
dementia was determined based on postmortem interviews
with next of kin asking if a physician gave a diagnosis of
dementia during life. All interviews were conducted inde-
pendently and blinded to the results of the neuropatho-
logical
examination.
An
identical
assessment
was
performed for the Framingham Heart Study cohort.
Neuropathological examination
Neuropathological processing followed the procedures
previously established for the BU ADC and CTE brain
bank, which included a comprehensive analysis designed
to screen for neurodegenerative conditions [16, 17]. The
neuropathological diagnosis of CTE was made using the
NINDS consensus criteria for CTE [4] that are based on
the presence of abnormal perivascular accumulations of
hyperphosphorylated tau in neurons, astrocytes, and cell
processes in an irregular and patchy distribution concen-
trated at the depths of cortical sulci [4]. The McKee
stages of CTE, varying from stage I to stage IV, are based
on the extent and severity of the ptau pathology [5].
Cases that met neuropathological criteria for comorbid
Alzheimer disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration,
diffuse Lewy body disease, Parkinson’s disease, or motor
neuron disease were excluded from analysis.
Immunohistochemistry
All brain tissue was processed identically by fixation in
periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde and stored at 4 °C. A
tissue block from the dorsolateral frontal cortex was
taken perpendicular to the superior frontal sulcus, em-
bedded in paraffin and cut at 10 μm (AT8) or 20 μm
(Iba1, CD68, GFAP). Antigen retrieval was performed by
boiling sections in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 10 mins.
Sections were incubated at 4 °C overnight with anti-
bodies to anti-Iba1 (Wako, 1:500), anti-GFAP (Dako,
1:500), anti-PHF-tau (AT8) (Pierce Endogen, 1:2000),
and anti-CD68 (Vector, 1:500). Sections were treated
with biotinylated secondary antibodies then labeled with
a 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazol HRP substrate kit (Vector
Laboratories). Sections were counter stained with Gill’s
Hematoxlin
(Vector
Laborities
H-3401)
and
cover-
slipped with Permount mounting medium. For fluores-
cent stains, antibody visualization was performed using
secondary antibodies bound to Alexa fluorophores (Invi-
trogen) at a dilution of 1:500. Sudan black at a dilution
of 0.1 % was used to quench autofluorescence.
Microscopy and analysis
The sulcal depths of the dorsolateral frontal (DLF) cor-
tex are often the first regions involved by CTE pathology
[5], suggesting this region could be a sensitive measure
of early changes. Immunostained slides were scanned
and digitized at 20× magnification using the Aperio
ScanScope (Leica) as previously described [18]. Serial
sections were cut and used for the markers mentioned
above. Each stain and quantification was performed on
one section using subsequent serial sections in the order
of AT8, Iba1, GFAP, and then CD68. The depth of the
cortical sulcus (defined as the bottom third of two con-
necting gyri) was selected and highlighted in Image-
Scope (Lecia). The white matter/gray matter boundary
was used as the outer edge of the region of interest so
only gray matter was highlighted. Using Leica image
analysis and automated counting software, the Aperio
nuclear algorithm (Version 9) was set to recognize and
count Iba1+ microglia, GFAP+ astrocytes, CD68 positive
cells, and AT8 immunoreactive neurofibrillary tangles
(NFTs) restricted to the highlighted areas. Each counting
algorithm was individually modified to recognize cell
shape, size, and staining intensity. The Aperio positive
pixel count (Version 9) was also used to determine the
area of immunoreactivity. All quantifications were stan-
dardized to the area measured and presented as density
per analyzed area.
Statistics
Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS version 20.0
(IBM inc.), Prism v6 (Graphpad Software), and SAS
version 9.4 (SAS Institute). CD68 density, AT8 immuno-
reactive NFT density, and AT8 density were log trans-
formed to normalize for regression analyses. A one-way
ANOVA was used to compare Iba1 and GFAP cell dens-
ity among control, RHI, and CTE groups. CD68 density

 was compared using a Kruskal-Wallis test due to the
non-normal distribution of the data. Age at death was
included in all regression analyses to control for age-
associated changes. Since the outcome variables (CD68
cell density and AT8 density) are correlated, the use of
independent regression models for each outcome would
give biased estimates. To avoid this endogeneity prob-
lem, simultaneous
equation
modeling was used
to
determine direct and indirect effects of predictor vari-
ables (age at death and years of RHI exposure) on out-
come variables (CD68 cell density and AT8 density).
Since we have two exogenous variables (age at death and
years of RHI exposure) for two outcomes (CD68 cell
density and AT8 density), the model is just-identified.
Years of RHI was used as a metric of exposure as op-
posed to number of concussion due to the previous find-
ing CTE tauopathy stage was significantly predicted by
years of contact sports play, but not number of concus-
sions [10]. To ascertain correlations between dementia
and neuroinflammation, we elected to use age of first ex-
posure to football as the beginning of the pathologic
process, as CTE pathology likely exists on a continuum.
AT8 immunoreactive NFT density and CD68 cell density
were plotted based on time from first exposure to death
and a linear regression was used to test for correlations
(Fig. 3). A probability curve was generated using a binary
logistic regression predicting dementia based on time
from first exposure to death. Another binary logistic re-
gression was then used to test the association between
dementia, CD68 cell density, and AT8 immunoreactive
NFT density.
Results
Subjects without CTE had less RHI exposure
One-way ANOVA analysis demonstrated individuals
with RHI exposure but no CTE pathology were signifi-
cantly younger at age of death compared to those with
severe CTE (p < 0.001) but not mild CTE (p = 0.120).
Furthermore, the RHI without CTE group had signifi-
cantly less years of exposure to RHI than both mild (p =
0.002) and severe (p > 0.001) CTE. No significant differ-
ence was observed for number of reported concussions
between the RHI exposed groups (Table 1).
Increased neuroinflammation is associated with longer
RHI exposure
Overall, there was no statistical difference in the density
of total Iba1 immunoreactive microglia (Fig. 1a) or
GFAP immunoreactive astrocytes (Fig. 1b) between
groups. However, the cellular density of CD68 immuno-
reactivity, a lysosomal marker that labels phagocytic/ac-
tivated microglia [19], was significantly increased in
subjects with a history of RHI, with or without CTE,
when compared to controls (Fig. 1c). Consistent with
increased density of CD68 immunoreactive cells, micro-
glia also exhibited a phenotypic change (Fig. 1d). High
power imaging revealed a larger cell body and more nu-
merous,
shorter
processes,
indicative
of
a
reactive
phenotype in RHI subjects (Fig. 1e, arrows). Iba1 positive
activated microglia were frequently found surrounding
AT8 immunoreactive neurons (Fig. 1f, white arrow) with
extended microglial processes that contacted the AT8
positive neuronal soma (Fig. 1f, blue arrow).
The density of CD68 positive cells predicts tau pathology
To test the hypothesis that RHI exposure and age have
effects on microglial activation and ptau pathology and
to test for both direct and indirect effects, we performed
a simultaneous equations regression model analysis. This
form of structural equation modeling is useful to ac-
count for potential feedback loops. Additionally, the cu-
mulative effect through a specific pathway of multiple
variables, as well as individual direct effects can be mod-
eled and tested. The stability coefficient of the model
was 0.09, which is less than one and means that the con-
dition for converged total and indirect effects was satis-
fied. The model fit was excellent with the Goodness of
Fit Index (GFI) equal to 0.99. Years of RHI was used as
the exposure metric instead of the number of concus-
sions due to linear regression modeling demonstrating
CD68 having a significant relationship with RHI (β =
0.418, p < 0.001), but not number of concussions (β =
0.128, p = 0.266). This is consistent with previously pub-
lished data [10]. This model tested the direct and total
effects of predictor variables (age and years of exposure
to RHI) on select outcomes (CD68 cell density and AT8
tau density). The statistical outcomes of this model are
provided in Table 2 and a visual representation of the
data is provided in Fig. 2. Overall, the number of years
of exposure to RHI had a significant direct effect on
both AT8 density (β = 0.4614, p < 0.0001) and CD68 cell
density (β = 0.3911, p < 0.0001). Comparing the stan-
dardized effects demonstrated that the effect of RHI ex-
posure on AT8 tau density was 86 % direct and 14 % via
increased CD68 immunopositive cell density (Table 2).
Age also demonstrated a significant positive effect on
AT8 density (β = 0.5125, p < 0.0001) but not CD68 cell
density (β = −0.0195, p = 0.84). In addition, CD68 cell
density had a significant direct positive effect on AT8
tau pathology (β = 0.1759, p < 0.0001). AT8 density also
had a direct positive effect on CD68 cell density (β =
0.0498, p < 0.0001), suggesting a positive feedback loop.
The magnitude of the standardized effect of CD68 cell
density on AT8 density was 3.5 times greater than the
effect of AT8 tau pathology on CD68 cell density. Over-
all, duration of RHI had an effect on severity of AT8 tau
pathology that was both direct and via increased CD68
cell density. Furthermore, the observed increase in
Cherry et al. Acta Neuropathologica Communications  (2016) 4:112 
Page 4 of 9
 CD68 cell density was independent of age and directly
associated with duration of exposure to RHI and severity
of AT8 immunopositivity (Table 2).
Neuroinflammation indirectly correlates with dementia
To compare the time course of neuroinflammation, NFT
aggregation, dementia, and to assess possible correla-
tions, variables were graphed together based on the time
from first exposure to death (Fig. 3). The presence of de-
mentia was based on medical record review or next of
kin interview denoting a diagnosis of dementia made by
a physician during life. Binary logistic regression demon-
strated that longer time from first exposure to death was
significantly associated with an increased risk of devel-
oping dementia (OR = 1.102, p < 0.001). A probability
curve was generated based on the logistic regression and
is plotted in Fig. 3 (black line). In addition, time from
first exposure to death significantly predicted CD68
density (β = 0.005, p = 0.0213) (green line) and separ-
ately, neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) density (β = 0.043, p <
0.0001) (red line) (Fig. 3). The slopes (CD68: 0.005020 ±
0.002125, NFT: 0.04274 ± 0.005880) suggest that there is

 a 0.5 % increase of CD68 positive cells/mm2 per year
and a 4.2 % increase in NFTs/mm2 per year in CTE.
To test if neuroinflammation was a predictor of demen-
tia, a binary logistic regression demonstrated dementia was
significantly predicted by CD68 (OR = 1.010, p = 0.011) in-
dependent of age (OR = 1.055, p = 0.007). Interestingly,
when ptau pathology was included into the model, NFT
density (OR = 1.12, p = 0.007) significantly predicted de-
mentia independent of age (OR = 1.050, p =0.039), but
CD68 density (OR = 1.007, p = 0.079) was no longer a sig-
nificant predictor. This suggests that the effect CD68 has
on dementia is mediated through the development of tau
pathology.
Discussion
We show that increased neuroinflammation, as evidenced
by increased CD68 cell density and enhanced microglia re-
active morphology, was associated with more severe AT8
immunopositive ptau pathology in the DLF cortex of sub-
jects neuropathologically diagnosed with CTE. Further-
more, duration of RHI exposure, as defined by the years of
football played, predicted greater density of CD68 positive
inflammatory microglia in American football players with
and without CTE pathology. A simultaneous equations re-
gression model demonstrated that exposure to RHI had a
significant effect on ptau pathology that was both direct
and indirect (via increased CD68 cell density). Last, we
found that increased neuroinflammation was related to the
risk of a subject being diagnosed with dementia and that
the relationship was mediated through ptau, independent
of age. Altogether, this suggests that increased neuroinflam-
mation as a consequence of prolonged RHI exposure may

 play an important role in the development of ptau
pathology in CTE. To our knowledge this is the first data
directly linking neuroinflammation to the development of
ptau pathology in CTE.
Although moderate/severe TBI has been observed to
result in long lived neuroinflammation [20], even mild
head impacts may lead to brain injury, including multi-
focal traumatic axonal disruption, that is concentrated in
regions such as the white matter-gray matter junction,
around blood vessels, and at the depth of the cortical
sulci [12, 21–23]. Multifocal traumatic axonal injury
may be an early trigger for neuroinflammation [24], with
microglial activation and initiation of an immune re-
sponse that serves to repair or limit the damage [25].
The interval between injuries also impacts the long-term
CNS response [26]. After isolated or infrequent mild
TBI the induced neuroinflammatory response may dissi-
pate as the CNS tissue is repaired. However, repetitive
injuries, particularly RHI that occur during a short inter-
val that do not allow for complete recovery, may lead to
a persistent proinflammatory state. Furthermore, neur-
onal death resulting from mechanical injuries has the
potential to result in cell lysis and exposure of intracellu-
lar components
into the
extracellular
environment.
Intracellular proteins like HMGB1, ATP, and other dam-
age associated molecular patterns (DAMPS) can trigger
a rapid innate immune response and induce chronic
neuroinflammation [27].
Numerous studies have demonstrated that neuroin-
flammation occurs acutely following TBI [11, 28–30]. In
addition, mouse models that mimic the repetitive injury
observed in humans have shown that glial changes and
neuroinflammation precede ptau pathology [31, 32]. We
also observed elevated CD68 positive cell density in
RHI-exposed subjects in the absence of any ptau path-
ology (Fig. 1c). These individuals were younger and the
duration of exposure to RHI was less than the CTE
group; thus, they may represent individuals in a pro-
dromal state.
The simultaneous equations regression analysis is a
form of structural equation modeling that incorporates
feedback loops [33] and is therefore well suited to model
the effects of interacting pathologies. In a cohort of sub-
jects with and without exposure to RHI, we found that
RHI exposure had a cumulative effect on the extent of
ptau pathology that was both direct and mediated
through increased CD68 cell density (Table 2, Fig. 2). An
activated microglial-mediated increase in ptau is consist-
ent with previous work demonstrating that neuroinflam-
mation increased the activity of GSK3β and p38MAPK,
both of which are involved in tau hyperphosphorylation
[14] and promote ptau pathology [34]. The simultaneous
equations regression model also demonstrated that both
CD68 and ptau had a significant effect on each other
(Fig. 2). This is in agreement with previous studies in
mouse models that have shown an inflammatory medi-
ated increase in ptau as well as tau induced neuroinflam-
mation [35]. Our data suggest that a similar feedback
mechanism may be present in human CTE. Thus, down
regulation of chronic microglia activation might repre-
sent an important therapeutic target for CTE. Further-
more, there was a significant direct effect of RHI
exposure on increased ptau pathology independent of
CD68. The mechanisms underlying this increase in ptau
following RHI are unknown, but might involve calcium
influx and activation of kinases which are known to
occur after mild traumatic brain injury [26]. In addition
to its association with RHI exposure and ptau pathology,
CD68 cell density in the DLF appears to plays an indir-
ect role in the development of dementia in CTE, medi-
ated through ptau pathology. A binary logistic regression
demonstrated dementia was significantly predicted by
CD68 independent of age, but that association was elim-
inated when a measure of ptau pathology was included
in the model. Our data suggest that increased activated
microglia occur early following RHI, followed by a later,
but steeper increase in ptau pathology, and finally cumu-
lating in dementia in some cases (Fig. 3). In support of
this, cumulative RHI exposure has recently been associ-
ated with cognitive impairment later in life [8] and
TSPO PET ligands for activated microglia have shown
elevated activity in retired NFL players at risk for CTE
[36]. Activated microglia and persistent neuroinflamma-
tion are one mechanism by which RHI exposure may
drive the development and spread of ptau pathology and
lead to dementia in CTE.
There are several limitations to our study. There is
selection bias in an autopsy-based study of individuals
whose brains are donated by the family, and the sub-
jects may not represent the population as a whole.
Additionally, clinical and RHI exposure histories are
obtained retrospectively and are subject to bias. Future
longitudinal, prospective studies will be needed to ver-
ify these results. For the simultaneous equations re-
gression
analysis,
CD68
and
AT8
densities
were
treated as both outcomes and predictors to avoid the
“endogeneity” problem (i.e., (1) a linear regression
model that has independent variables as predictors
would give invalid inference due to the significant cor-
relation between the predictor and the error term, and
(2) their coefficients would be biased) [37]. To address
the inference and bias problems caused by endogene-
ity, we used simultaneous equation models, which are
widely used in econometrics [33]. For cell quantitation
we used the Aperio nuclear algorithm to determine
the number of stained cells. In contrast to design
based stereological methods, the nuclear algorithm
lacks 3-dimensional volume measurements and does

 not provide an estimate of the total number of micro-
glia [18]. However, we obtained similar results when
using the positive pixel algorithm. Finally, while CD68
is typically associated with a more inflammatory,
phagocytic microglia phenotype [38], glial activation is
too complex and dynamic to be completely recapitu-
lated by one marker. Future studies will be needed to
explore additional markers and inflammatory cyto-
kines to better define the neuroinflammatory pheno-
type in CTE.
Conclusions
Here, we showed for the first time that neuroinflam-
mation was associated with greater ptau pathology in
CTE. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the duration
of RHI exposure predicted increased activated micro-
glial cell density that, in turn, was directly associated
with ptau pathology (Fig. 2). Lastly, our data suggest
that neuroinflammation might partially underlie clin-
ical symptoms of CTE, like dementia, through their ef-
fect on ptau pathology. Overall, the potential central
role of increased neuroinflammation in CTE develop-
ment and progression suggests that inflammatory mol-
ecules may be important diagnostic or predictive
biomarkers as well as promising therapeutic targets in
CTE.
