SUMMARY
Physiologic and environmental factors can modulate
antibiotic activity and thus pose a significant chal-
lenge to antibiotic treatment. The quinolone class
of
antibiotics,
which
targets
bacterial
topoiso-
merases, fails to kill bacteria that have grown to
high density; however, the mechanistic basis for
this persistence is unclear. Here, we show that
exhaustion of the metabolic inputs that couple
carbon catabolism to oxidative phosphorylation is a
primary cause of growth phase-dependent persis-
tence to quinolone antibiotics. Supplementation
of stationary-phase cultures with glucose and a
suitable terminal electron acceptor to stimulate
respiratory metabolism is sufficient to sensitize
cells to quinolone killing. Using this approach, we
successfully sensitize high-density populations of
Escherichia
coli,
Staphylococcus
aureus,
and
Mycobacterium smegmatis to quinolone antibiotics.
Our
findings
link
growth-dependent
quinolone
persistence to discrete impairments in respiratory
metabolism and identify a strategy to kill non-
dividing bacteria.
INTRODUCTION
Antibiotics are the main tools to treat infectious diseases
caused by bacteria; however, effective therapy is limited by
the ability of bacterial populations to escape lethal drug chal-
lenges. The evasion of antibiotic stress by bacteria is receiving
extensive attention by the scientific community (Van den Bergh
et al., 2017). In particular, characterizing and classifying the
causes of antibiotic failure has been a recent focus (Brauner
et
al.,
2016).
These
distinct
classes
include:
antibiotic
resistance, characterized by a change in the minimal inhibitory
concentration; antibiotic tolerance, characterized by a change
in killing kinetics; and antibiotic persistence, characterized by
the presence of a time-dependent, bi-phasic killing profile.
Bacterial resistance conferred by genetically encoded factors
such as efflux pumps, drug-inactivating enzymes, or drug-
target mutations is generally well understood, while the latter
processes remain poorly characterized (Balaban et al., 2013;
Bush et al., 2011). Antibiotic treatment failure associated with
bacterial tolerance and persistence is relevant to many infec-
tion
types,
including
prosthetic
implant-related
infections
caused by Staphylococcus aureus or pulmonary infections
caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Fauvart et al., 2011).
Importantly, drug tolerance and persistence have been identi-
fied as physiologic states that can promote the development
of genetic resistance (Levin-Reisman et al., 2017), further
underscoring the need to understand the biological basis for
these phenomena.
Many early investigations into phenotypic tolerance and
persistence found links to intrinsic genetic factors, including
toxin-antitoxin modules and stress-response regulators (Do
¨ rr
et al., 2010; Moyed and Bertrand, 1983). However, none of
these factors could fully account for the variety and magnitude
of observed phenotypes. More recently, stress responses
related to extrinsic environmental cues, such as the starva-
tion-induced stringent response (SOS), have been identified
as drivers of antibiotic treatment failure (Do
¨ rr et al., 2009;
Maisonneuve et al., 2013). This concept suggests the impor-
tance of the bacterial growth environment as a modulating
factor of antibiotic efficacy (Harms et al., 2016). Consistent
with this, attempts to potentiate aminoglycoside activity have
focused on metabolic stimulation (Allison et al., 2011; Barraud
et al., 2013; Knudsen et al., 2013; Meylan et al., 2017;
Peng et al., 2015). In these studies, bacteria were sensitized

 exclusively to the aminoglycoside class of antibiotics by
stimulation of proton motive force-dependent antibiotic uptake.
Others have shown metabolic potentiation of daptomycin, an
external cell membrane-active antibiotic (Prax et al., 2016).
Here, we investigate a specific manifestation of persistence
characterized by cell-density-dependent drug failure. This
form of persistence is hallmarked by the reduction of drug
efficacy when challenging high-cell-density populations. While
persister cells are often characterized using killing as a function
of the drug incubation time, we define density-dependent
persistence
(DDP)
as
dose-dependent
reduction
in
drug
efficacy as a function of the initial cell density.
To assess mechanisms of DDP, we used antibiotics from
the quinolone family, which are known to be affected by the
density of the cell population (Zeiler, 1985). Quinolone-
induced lethality derives from the poisoning of the type II
topoisomerases, DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which
is proposed to drive DNA fragmentation leading to cell death
(Drlica et al., 2008). Though binding and corruption of type II
topoisomerases are essential for quinolone-induced bacterial
cell death, additional factors, such as byproducts of cellular
respiration and metabolism, have been implicated in bacteri-
cidal properties of quinolones (Dwyer et al., 2014, 2015).
Underscoring the metabolic element of drug efficacy, the
modulation
of
quinolone
antibiotic
activity
against
both
Escherichia coli and S. aureus has been linked to the ability
of cells to produce ATP (Conlon et al., 2016; Shan et al.,
2017). Here, we show that metabolite exhaustion is the major
driver in quinolone DDP and develop a strategy to sensitize
metabolically limited, high-density cultures of bacteria to
quinolones. This approach may have broad applicability to
non-dividing bacterial infections and significantly impact the
utility of quinolone antibiotics in the treatment of clinical
bacterial infections.
RESULTS
Ciprofloxacin Activity against E. coli Is Dependent on
Growth Phase
Ciprofloxacin (cipro) is a widely used second-generation
quinolone. With a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)
of 8–10 ng/mL in rich LB medium targeting E. coli strain
MG1655, it is one of the most potent drugs of the quinolone
family. However, the lethal effect of cipro decreases as the
bacterial population grows to higher cell density (Figures 1A–
1C). Alternative fluoroquinolones from the third generation
(levofloxacin) and fourth generation (moxifloxacin) show similar
density-dependent effects (Figures S3D and S3E). Quinolone
potency is highest during exponential growth at low cell density
(< 1% of maximal growth) and starts to reduce as soon as cells
reach 10% of the maximal carrying capacity in LB media
(around 108 cells). This DDP is characterized by the inability of
cipro to kill a fraction of the cell population, even with a dose
representing 1,0003 the MIC and a treatment time of 24 hr
(Figure 1B). The fraction of surviving cells significantly increases
upon
entry
into
stationary
phase
(Figures
1A–1C)
and
represents 10%–100% of the population depending on the
drug concentration used for the treatment.
In order to study DDP to cipro in more detail, we tested a range
of cultivation conditions. We treated cells with 1 mg/mL cipro
(1003 MIC), as this concentration achieved maximal killing at
low cell density and retained cell killing at intermediate cell
density (Figure 1B). We further conducted our experiments in
MOPS-rich media to ensure that the DDP observed in LB is
conserved across discrete growth conditions (Figures S1A–
S1C). Consistent with previous reports, we found that an initial
dilution of 1/10,000 from overnight cultures was necessary to
avoid pre-existing cells being able to persist to our concentration
range (Figures S1D and S1E) (Brauner et al., 2016).

 To exclude the possibility that DDP to cipro was entirely a
consequence of impaired drug uptake, we examined density-
dependent susceptibility of a quinolone-hypersensitive mutant,
recB, which is unable to repair DNA double-stranded breaks.
This mutant is still hypersensitive in stationary phase (Figures
S1F and S1G), suggesting that DDP to cipro is not exclusively
due to reduced diffusion of the drug. We confirmed these data
by performing uptake measurements of cipro by stationary-
phase cells (Figure S1H). We found that within 30 min,
stationary-phase bacteria were able to accumulate cipro in a
dose-dependent manner. From this finding, we hypothesized
that stationary-phase cells may still be damaged by quinolones;
however, the damage leads to limited cell death in wild-type cells
under these conditions. We thus hypothesized that environmental
constraints could be an additional factor in quinolone DDP.
To test this hypothesis, we examined the expression of an
unstable GFP variant under the control of the ribosomal RNA
promoter P1 (P1rrnB) (Maisonneuve et al., 2013; Mathieu et al.,
2016), the activity of which has been shown to correlate with
the overall ability of the cells to grow as well as the formation
of persister cells. We observed a gradual decrease in GFP
expression as the cell population increased, followed by a steep
drop in fluorescence corresponding to entry into stationary
phase (Figure 1D). This drop-off in P1rrnB activity correlated
with the large increase in cipro persistence observed in high-
density cultures (Figure 1C). P1rrnB activity can be modulated
by starvation signaling through the stringent response or, alter-
natively, by the depletion of cellular energy stores from nucleic
acid triphosphate molecules (ATP, GTP) (Paul et al., 2004).
As this ribosomal promoter element has been used as a proxy
for persister cells (Maisonneuve et al., 2013), we applied this sys-
tem to explore the contribution of the guanosine tetraphosphate
(ppGpp)-mediated stringent response on DDP to cipro. Persis-
tence of E. coli to bactericidal antibiotics, including cipro, has
been linked with the stringent response, which is modulated by
production of high levels of ppGpp by the enzymes RelA and
SpoT. We investigated the contribution of the E. coli stringent
response to DDP to cipro using ppGpp0 strain DrelAspoT.
Consistent with previous data (Maisonneuve et al., 2013), we
found that a stationary-phase DrelAspoT mutant displayed a
5.5-fold reduction in persister cells compared to wild-type (Fig-
ure 1E). We next assessed the accumulation of persister cells
over varying cell densities in the DrelAspoT background. Though
the total number of persister cells is reduced relative to wild-
type, the DrelAspoT mutant retains a marked DDP phenotype
(Figure 1F). We measured the activity of the P1rrnB promoter
in the DrelAspoT background, and the effective drop in expres-
sion occurring in stationary phase was independent of the
production of ppGpp (Figure S1I). These findings suggest that
starvation itself, rather than the induction of the stringent
response, is critical for DDP to cipro.
Both Carbon and Oxygen Are Necessary to Sensitize
Stationary-Phase Cells to Cipro
We next sought to elucidate the factors limiting cell death at high
cell density. To have greater control on the metabolic inputs in
the culture, we used defined MOPS-rich media for these exper-
iments. We first assessed if stationary-phase carbon depletion
was responsible for DDP to cipro. Consistent with earlier reports
(Allison et al., 2011), addition of glucose to stationary-phase cul-
tures promoted minimal increases of cipro activity. Sensitization
to 1 mg/mL of cipro by glucose was dose dependent starting at
0.4% with a plateau at 1% glucose (Figure 2A).
Because oxygen is a known limiting growth factor at high cell
density (Losen et al., 2004) and a known variable limiting quino-
lone sensitivity (Lewin et al., 1991), we next evaluated the effect
of media oxygenation on cipro activity in the presence and
absence of supplementary glucose. To this end, we measured
and modulated steady-state oxygen concentrations in static
culture systems (Figures 2A and 2B). Using this approach, we
first examined stationary-phase cell sensitivity to cipro in static
culture (Figure 2A). Notably, static cultures displayed the iden-
tical DDP to cipro (Figure 2C). Importantly, we observed that
static cultures receiving no aeration showed no sensitization to
glucose supplementation (Figures 2A and 2D). This observation
suggested the possibility that glucose supplementation can
partially restore the activity of quinolone antibiotics only under
aerated growth conditions.
To further explore aeration-dependent cipro activity, we
measured dissolved oxygen as a function of growth density
using a solid-state oxygen detector sensitive to molecular
oxygen at 8 ppb under static growth conditions (Figure 2B).
We found that dissolved oxygen dropped below the detection
limit at 220 min of growth, corresponding to a population density
of 5e7 cells, or 5% of maximal growth. Continuous monitoring of
stationary-phase cultures in static growth conditions showed
that dissolved oxygen levels remained below our detection limit
even after 24 hr of static incubation (Figure 2B).
To confirm that bacterial cells were responding physiologically
to changes in oxygen tension as culture density increased,
consistent with an aerobic-to-anaerobic transition, we measured
gene expression of two genes known to be differentially regu-
lated by the oxygen concentration. Using qPCR, we compared
the expression of the main cytochrome oxidase (cyoA) and the
anaerobic fumarate reductase gene (frdA) to the expression of
the housekeeping gene zwf (Tseng et al., 1996) (Figure 2D). We
found expression patterns typical of an aerobic-to-anaerobic
shift, demonstrating progressive cyoA downregulation and
increasing frdA expression as the population density increased.
Thus, in static culture (Figure 2D), as cell density increases, the
bacterial population adapts physiologically by reorganizing its
electron transport chain in a manner consistent with reduced
oxygen availability, further suggesting that oxygen starvation is
present in high-density cultures.
To test the hypothesis that both carbon and oxygen constitute
simultaneous limiting factors in DDP to cipro, we evaluated anti-
biotic susceptibility of static cultures receiving defined oxygen
supplementation. We provided oxygen by bubbling filtered air
into the media at a calibrated rate (10 psi) to maintain a
steady-state oxygen tension of 5%–6% in the static stationary-
phase cultures. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that
stationary-phase E. coli was highly susceptible to cipro when
exposed to a combination of glucose and oxygen, while addition
of glucose or oxygen alone had minimal effect (Figure 2E). Under
this specific level of glucose supplementation (0.4%), the degree
of killing under static conditions with oxygen supplementation
Molecular Cell 68, 1147–1154, December 21, 2017
1149
 exceeded killing found in the optimized shaking condition (Fig-
ures 2A and 2E). We next assessed the influence of this treat-
ment on cipro uptake and found no difference between control
and metabolite-supplemented cultures (Figure S2A). Taken
together, these data suggest that DDP to cipro in static growth
conditions is mediated by blocks to cellular respiration imposed
by limitations in both carbon and oxygen and that supply of these
two factors is sufficient to sensitize high-density cultures to
cipro. To further assess this hypothesis, we attempted to sensi-
tize a well-characterized E. coli strain (ECOM) that is limited to
fermentative metabolism under aerobic conditions due to
deletion of the complete cytochrome oxidase loci and a quinol
monoxygenase (Portnoy et al., 2008). This strain is genetically
incapable of coupling molecular oxygen to oxidative phosphor-
ylation. Consistent with our hypothesis, the ECOM strain was
insensitive to cipro at high density when provided supplemental
glucose and oxygen (Figures 2E, S2B, and S2C).
Since we observed increased killing in the oxygen-supple-
mented static cultures relative to shaking cultures (Figures 2A
and 2E), we hypothesized that aeration may be limited even
under optimized shaking conditions and thus that oxygen may
be a limiting factor in this setting. Due to the physical constraints
of the system, we were not able to confidently measure
dissolved oxygen in our shaking conditions with the oxygen
probe. As a proxy for aero-anaerobic transition, we evaluated
the expression levels of cyoA and frdA in shaking cultures and
found that cyoA and frdA expression patterns were similar in
both shaking and static cultures, further suggesting that oxygen
tension is limiting even when cultures are optimally aerated by
shaking (Figure 2F).

anaerobicrespiration could alsoleadtoglucose-dependentsensi-
tization to cipro in stationary phase. We tested nitrate, DMSO, and
fumarate as alternative electron acceptors in MOPS-rich media
under shaking conditions (Figure 3A). While none of these electron
acceptors alone was able to sensitize cells to cipro, we found that
in combination with glucose, fumarate synergistically sensitized
high-density cultures to 1 mg/mL cipro in a manner similar to
oxygen supplementation (Figures 3A, S3A, and S3B). Similar
synergy was observed using the third- and fourth-generation
quinolone antibiotics, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, respectively
(Figure S3F), indicating conservation of the phenotype across
the chemical generations of quinolones. Increasing glucose above
0.2% did not enhance killing in conjunction with fumarate
(Figure S3A), indicating again that carbon source availability is
required, but not strictly limiting, for DDP to cipro.
We next assessed the dose-dependent relationship of cipro
sensitization to the combination of glucose and fumarate. While
sensitization was limited to concentrations above 500 ng/mL of
cipro for the MOPS-rich media (Figure 3B), stationary-phase
cells grown in LB supplemented with glucose and fumarate
were killed by cipro at concentrations as low as 50 ng/mL
(Figure 3C).
As our data suggested that cellular respiration was a limiting
factor for sensitization by glucose, we wanted to confirm that
in our condition cells used fumarate as a terminal electron
acceptor. We thus tested cipro sensitivity at high cell density

 of a mutant strain lacking the catalytic subunit of the fumarate
reductase gene, frdA. We found that the frdA mutant was not
able to be sensitized to cipro killing by the combination
glucose-fumarate, suggesting a direct role of alternative respira-
tion through fumarate reduction as a key factor in sensitizing
cells to cipro (Figures 3D and S3B). Complementation of the
frdA mutant using a plasmid expressing the frdA gene under
the control of the native promoter restored sensitization to cipro
by glucose and fumarate supplementation (Figure 3D).
We next sought to better understand how the enzymatic reduc-
tion of fumarate leads to cell death by cipro. We hypothesized
that the addition of fumarate was sensitizing cells by specifically
increasing cellular respiration (Figure 2E) as a component of
overall cellular metabolism rather than simply driving cell division.
Although we did not observe a significant increase in CFU over
time after the addition of glucose and fumarate (Figure S3C),
we decided to use a more sensitive method to differentiate
cellular respiration and cell growth. To assess this, we asked
whether glucose-fumarate supplementation could sensitize
stationary-phase cells to ampicillin (Figure 3E), a b-lactam
antibiotic that requires cell division for killing, or gentamicin
(Figure 3F), which requires an active metabolism and the
generation of a proton motive force for drug uptake. Confirming
our
original
hypothesis,
glucose-fumarate
supplementation
sensitized stationary-phase E. coli to gentamicin; however,
even high concentrations of ampicillin did not kill stationary-
phase cells with glucose-fumarate supplementation, further
supporting the hypothesis that metabolite addition was not
inducing significant cell growth in high-density cultures.

were generalizable to two additional bac-
teria, S. aureus (MIC: 250 mg/ml) and
M. smegmatis (MIC: 500 ng/ml). Though
cipro alone was not as potent for treating S. aureus and
M. smegmatis in exponentially growing cultures as for E. coli,
higher doses could successfully reduce the number of viable
cells below the limit of detection for both species (Figures 4A
and 4B). Similar to E. coli, S. aureus and M. smegmatis exhibit
marked DDP to cipro upon entry into stationary phase (Figures
4A and 4B).
Because the M. smegmatis genome includes several putative
fumarate reductase enzymes (Caspi et al., 2016), we attempted
to sensitize aerated stationary-phase cultures to cipro by using a
combination of glucose and fumarate (Figure 4C). We found that
while 0.4% fumarate or 0.4% glucose alone could sensitize cul-
tures weakly, the combination of both compounds strongly
sensitized M. smegmatis stationary-phase cultures. S. aureus
is not able to use fumarate as an alternative electron acceptor
(Fuchs et al., 2007). Thus, we tried sensitizing S. aureus station-
ary cultures to cipro by the combination of oxygen and glucose
(Figure 4D). While the addition of glucose or bubbling had a
limited effect on cipro activity, the addition of 0.4% glucose
together with bubbling sensitized S. aureus static cultures to 5
and 10 mg/mL of cipro. These observations indicate that the
stimulation of metabolism specifically at the level of cellular
respiration is a broadly applicable method to sensitize a range
of bacteria to cipro.
DISCUSSION
DDP to quinolone antibiotics is a known phenotype without a
defined mechanism (Zeiler, 1985). Here we show that external
limits to specific metabolic pathways, rather than the cellular
response to starvation, are the key factors modulating quino-
lone activity under high-cell-density conditions. While carbon
sources are limiting, replenishment of carbon oxidation path-
ways alone is insufficient for cipro activity, and the availability

 of a suitable terminal electron acceptor is critical to regenerate
lethal activity of quinolone antibiotics in high cell-density
settings. With this framework, we propose a simple, two-input
metabolite-driven strategy to stimulate the activity of cipro
against a range of bacteria at high densities. The implications
for therapeutic implementation of this strategy warrant further
studies.
An emerging model for bacterial persistence to antibiotics has
focused on physiologic adaptation to starvation, as mediated by
the stringent response (Harms et al., 2016). A key finding from
our work, in particular using a ppGpp0 strain, is that starvation
itself rather than cellular adaptations to starvation is the major
driving force in DDP. Antibiotic persistence has been described
to derive from two physiologic processes that are either induced
or stochastic, referred to as type I and type II persisters (Levin-
Reisman and Balaban, 2016). In our work, it is important to
note that we have focused on induced, type I persisters specif-
ically and that conclusions drawn here cannot necessarily be
applied to stochastically formed persisters, which exist in our
sensitized cultures after treatment.
While E. coli can oxidize carbon and generate ATP through
fermentation, we find that cell killing by cipro requires activity
of respiratory metabolic pathways, which can be accomplished
by a limited number of metabolic inputs. It is known that topo-
isomerase activity is ATP dependent and that stationary-phase
cells require topoisomerases to recover supercoiling (Gutie
´ r-
rez-Estrada et al., 2014), suggesting that starvation states
may limit the activity of these enzymes. Furthermore, increased
cellular respiration is implicated in antibiotic-mediated cell
death through downstream processes (Grant et al., 2012;
Lobritz et al., 2015). We hypothesize that priming respiratory
metabolism by the addition of a carbon source and electron
acceptor affects both target corruption and other, less-charac-
terized, downstream processes to sensitize cells to quino-
lones. Remarkably, one study has been able to leverage the
metabolic stress induced by extreme levels of intracellular
fumarate accumulation to promote a broad range of persis-
tence phenotypes (Kim et al., 2016). This work emphasizes
the complex interaction between cellular metabolic activity
and drug sensitivity.
While previous starvation models have focused on the
availability of carbon and nitrogen nutrients in the media
(Allison et al., 2011; Amato et al., 2013; Meylan et al., 2017;
Nguyen et al., 2011; Shan et al., 2017), we found that high-
density static cultures quickly utilize the available dissolved
oxygen, rendering this factor limiting in the metabolic process
of cellular respiration. By coupling these measurements to
expression data of genes that typify the aero-anaerobic transi-
tion, cyoA and frdA, we suspect that oxygen becomes limiting
in both aerated and static cultures before entry into stationary
phase. In our aerated cultivation system with E. coli, we detect
an increase in persistence to cipro when the population
reached 1e8 cells per milliliter of media (OD600 of 0.3) or
approximately 10% of the maximal carrying capacity. This is
consistent with a well-described change in the growth status
of cells in LB media (Sezonov et al., 2007). These findings,
combined with the knowledge that the bactericidal activity of
drugs such as quinolones is sensitive to the aero-anaerobic
transition (Lewin et al., 1991), suggest the importance of
both experimental growth conditions and sample handling in
assessment of antibiotic sensitivity. Variation of growth condi-
tions applied among laboratories could impact conclusions
made in the field of antimicrobial research. We propose that
the percent maximal carrying capacity be considered in order
to help standardize antibiotic activity assessment.
Although antibiotic persistence has been previously impli-
cated in recurring and chronic infections (Fauvart et al., 2011),
it is now also appreciated as an important factor that could affect
the spread of resistant bacteria (Levin-Reisman et al., 2017).
Antibiotics from the quinolone family are a significant component
of the arsenal against bacterial infectious diseases. However, a
SNP within one of the gyrase subunits can increase the MIC of
quinolones by orders of magnitude (Levy et al., 2004). It is
important to note that persistence displayed by high-cell-density
populations could also be subject to selection through adaptive
mutagenesis (Laureti et al., 2013). Thus, it is critical that we
more thoroughly understand the mechanistic underpinnings of
antibiotic persistence, so that rational approaches to the
deployment of our antibiotic arsenal can be achieved (Smith
and Romesberg, 2007).

Collins (jimjc@mit.edu).
EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
The strains used for this study were E. coli K12 strain MG1655, S. aureus strain ATCC 25923 and M. smegmatis strain mc2 155. E. coli
MG1655 was provided by the E. coli Genetic Stock Center database. S. aureus was provided by ATCC. M. smegmatis was provided
by Deborah Hung’s lab. E. coli and S. aureus were grown in Luria Broth (LB, Difco) medium and MOPS EZ Rich (MOPS, Teknova)
medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose. M. smegmatis was grown in Middlebrook 7H9 supplemented with 0.05% oleic acid,
2% dextrose, and 0.004% catalase (OADC). All cells were grown at 37�C.
METHOD DETAILS
Chemical preparation
Antibiotics stock solutions were made as follows: ciprofloxacin was dissolved to 10mg/mL in 0.1M NaOH; levofloxacin was dissolved
in glacial acetic acid; gentamicin, ampicillin, and moxifloxacin were dissolved to 10mg/mL in water. All metabolites were dissolved in
water to the following stock solutions: 40%w/v glucose, 20%w/v fumarate, 1M potassium nitrate.
Knockout construction
E. coli genetic knockouts DrecB and DfrdA were constructed by P1 transduction from the Keio collection. Knockout strains were
checked for accuracy by PCR amplification and gel electrophoresis.
Plasmid construction
The pZE21 backbone was used for construction of all plasmids (see Key Resources Table). The kan cassette in the pZE21 was
replaced with the CmR cassette flanked by FRT sites from the pKD3 vector. The frdA promoter replaced the tet promoter through
the xhoI and kpnI cut sites. The mcherry gene was replaced by frdA using the kpnI and hindIII cut sites. These plasmids were selected
by 35 mg/mL chloramphenicol. The P1::rrnb-gfp plasmid was made directly from the pZE21-mcherry backbone and selected
on 50 mg/mL kanamycin. Plasmids were transformed into background strains using CaCl2 transformation.
Density-persistence assay
An overnight culture of E. coli was diluted 1/10,000 in MOPS or LB in either (a) a non-baffled flask in the shaking incubator, 37�C,
300 rpm (shaking condition), or (b) in 30mL in a 100mL bottle in a 37�C water bath (static condition). At varying time points throughout
growth, 1mL of cells were moved to a culture tube and treated with 1 mg/mL ciprofloxacin added by pipetting; the tubes were placed
in shaking or static conditions, respectively. At each time point, cells were also serially diluted in PBS and plated on LB agar plates to
determine the CFU/mL at the time of treatment. Time points were taken until cells reached maximum carrying capacity. After 24 hr of
treatment, 100 mL of cells from each tube was spun down and re-suspended in PBS on a 96-well plate. Cells were then
serially diluted and plated on LB agar plates. The CFU/mL at treatment was normalized by the CFU/mL of stationary phase cells
(%max CFU/mL).
Potentiation assays
Cells were grown for 24 hr in either (a) a non-baffled flask overnight in the shaking incubator, 37�C, 300 rpm (shaking condition), or
(b) in 30mL in a 100mL bottle in a 37�C water bath (static condition). For the shaking condition, the volume of culture was set to a tenth
of the flask volume. For potentiation via metabolites, 1mL of culture was allocated to 14mL culture tubes and treated with varying
concentrations of ciprofloxacin, sugars, and electron acceptors. After 24 hr of treatment, 100 mL of cells were spun down
for 5min at 3500rpm in a 96-well plate. Cells were re-suspended in PBS and serially diluted in PBS by 10-fold. E. coli and
S. aureus were spotted on LB Agar (Difco) plates; M. smegmatis was spotted on 7H10(Difco)+10%v/v OADC supplement (Hardy
Diagnostics) plates. The plates were incubated at 37�C and colonies were counted, reported as colony-forming units per mL
(CFU/ml). For potentiation with oxygen, filtered air was bubbled (10 psi) into cells grown in the static condition for 24 hr with or without
glucose. These cells were then spun down and resuspended in PBS, serially diluted and plated on LB agar plates.
Dilution assay
An overnight culture of E. coli was diluted 1/10, 1/100, 1/1000, and 1/10000 in non-baffled flasks. The cultures were grown for 1h and
treated with either 1 mg/mL or 10 mg/mL cipro for 24 hr. Cells were spun down and re-suspended in PBS, diluted and plated on LB
agar plates to determine CFU/ml.

 Fluorescent reporter measurements
Fluorescence was measured by a SpectraMax M3 Microplate Reader spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). For P1::rrnb-gfp
signal, an overnight culture of cells was diluted 1/10,000 in MOPS or LB containing 50 mg/mL kanamycin. At appropriate time points
during growth, 300 mL of cells were moved to a black 96-well plate with clear bottom. The GFP signal was read on the plate reader at
an emission/excitation of 488/510 and PMT of 20. At each time point, cells were also serially diluted and plated for CFU/mL
determination.
Oxygen probe measurements
Dissolved oxygen in the media was measured using a Mettler Toledo InPro O2 sensor, 68601. The probe was kept in a static culture of
cells in a water bath and the probe measured the percent of dissolved oxygen every 5 min.
qPCR
Bacterial pellets were collected and stored using RNAprotect (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and RNA was
isolated using the RNeasy RNA isolation kit (QIAGEN). RNA was DNase treated and reverse transcribed with random hexamers using
the Verso RT kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). DNA contamination was tested by PCR of the RNA prep using the qPCR primers. Relative
gene expression was determined using SYBR Green 1-based real-time PCR (Roche). Concentrations were calculated from the linear
standard curve and all transcripts were normalized to the zwf gene expression.
Ciprofloxacin uptake measurements
The protocol was adapted from Asuquo and Piddock, 1993. 1mL of Stationary phase cells was treated with ciprofloxacin
and glucose-fumarate at 0.2% for 30min. Cells were then washed 2 times in 2mL ice cold PBS. Ciprofloxacin was extracted
using 1mL of glycine-HCl buffer at PH3 for 2H. Cell residues were pelleted by centrifugation and fluorescence was read from the
supernatant at 275nm excitation and 410nm emission. The quantity of ciprofloxacin was estimated using ciprofloxacin at defined
concentration diluted in glycine-HCl extract from a ciprofloxacin non-treated culture.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
All graphics and statistical analyses were done using PRISM software version 7. Figure 1E the comparison between WT and the
ppGpp0 was tested using two-tailed Mann-Whitney p = 0.017 n = 5 ppGpp0 and n = 7 for WT. Figures 2D and 2E, comparison to
the 120min time point was using two-tailed unpaired t test; Figure 2D all significant value: p value < 0.001. Figure 2E all significant
value: p value < 0.05.
