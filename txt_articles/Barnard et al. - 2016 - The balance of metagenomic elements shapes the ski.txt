The balance of metagenomic 
elements shapes the skin 
microbiome in acne and health
Emma Barnard1,*, Baochen Shi1,*, Dezhi Kang1, Noah Craft2 & Huiying Li1,3
Studies have emphasized the importance of disease-associated microorganisms in perturbed 
communities, however, the protective roles of commensals are largely under recognized and 
poorly understood. Using acne as a model disease, we investigated the determinants of the overall 
virulence property of the skin microbiota when disease- and health-associated organisms coexist 
in the community. By ultra-deep metagenomic shotgun sequencing, we revealed higher relative 
abundances of propionibacteria and Propionibacterium acnes phage in healthy skin. In acne patients, 
the microbiome composition at the species level and at P. acnes strain level was more diverse than in 
healthy individuals, with enriched virulence-associated factors and reduced abundance of metabolic 
synthesis genes. Based on the abundance profiles of the metagenomic elements, we constructed a 
quantitative prediction model, which classified the clinical states of the host skin with high accuracy in 
both our study cohort (85%) and an independent sample set (86%). Our results suggest that the balance 
between metagenomic elements, not the mere presence of disease-associated strains, shapes the 
overall virulence property of the skin microbiota. This study provides new insights into the microbial 
mechanism of acne pathogenesis and suggests probiotic and phage therapies as potential acne 
treatments to modulate the skin microbiota and to maintain skin health.
The skin is the largest organ in the human body and functions as the first line of defense by providing a protective 
barrier between the environment and inner body. The skin harbors several hundreds of resident microorganisms, 
which function in communities and protect the body from invasion of pathogens1,2. Several studies have shown 
that shifts in the skin microbiota are associated with various skin diseases3–7.
Acne vulgaris (commonly called acne) is the most common skin disease, affecting 80–85% of the popula-
tion8,9. It is most prevalent in adolescents and rarely occurs in people over the age of 5010,11. Although acne is not 
life threatening, it can lead to severe pain and scarring on the skin, and has profoundly negative psychosocial 
effects12,13. Acne is a disease of the pilosebaceous unit (commonly known as the hair follicle)14. While its etiology 
is still unclear with multiple factors involved, the Gram-positive lipophilic anaerobe Propionibacterium acnes has 
been thought to play a role in acne pathogenesis15,16. On the other hand, P. acnes is believed to contribute to skin 
health, preventing the colonization of opportunistic pathogens via its ability to convert sebum to free fatty acids 
and to maintain an acidic skin pH17,18.
In our previous characterization of the skin microbiome in healthy individuals and acne patients using 16S 
ribosomal RNA (rRNA) analysis, we revealed that certain P. acnes strains were highly associated with acne while 
some strains were associated with healthy skin5. At the genome level, P. acnes strains from different lineages harbor 
various genetic elements associated with either disease or health5,19,20. As individuals often harbor multiple P. acnes 
strains simultaneously which may have different roles in disease or health, it is unclear how the colonization of 
multiple strains in the follicle may affect the overall virulence or health properties of the skin microbial community.
Microbiome analyses based on the 16S rRNA or other phylogenetic marker genes and elements are often 
limited in providing molecular insight of disease association. Metagenomic shotgun sequencing analysis reveals 
not only the taxonomic composition but also the functional potential of the microbiome, and thus can provide 
better understanding of the potential microbial involvement in health or disease at the molecular level. To date,

in addition to the Human Microbiome Project (HMP)21, only a few metagenomic shotgun sequencing analyses of 
the skin microbiome have been described in young healthy adults22,23. While these studies focused on the healthy 
skin microbiome, few studies have characterized the microbiome in skin diseases using metagenomic shotgun 
sequencing. The metagenomic landscape of the skin microbiome in the human population, therefore, needs to be 
further investigated in both healthy and disease states with an expanded age range.
To investigate the role of the skin microbiota in acne, in this study we performed a metagenomic shotgun 
sequencing analysis of the skin microbiota of healthy individuals and acne patients. As older individuals rarely 
develop acne, we also characterized the skin microbiome of healthy individuals over the age of 55 as a compari-
son. The microbiome signatures for diseased and healthy states were identified and used to determine the clinical 
status of samples collected from healthy individuals and acne patients.
Results
High abundance of propionibacteria in the follicular microbiota. 
To identify the disease- and 
health-associated microbial elements in the follicular microbiota, we performed ultra-deep metagenomic shot-
gun sequencing of the samples collected from 38 acne patients and 30 age-matched healthy individuals (Fig. S1). 
After removal of human DNA sequences and low-quality reads, we obtained an average of 1.08 gigabase pairs 
(Gbp) per sample (6.9 × 
 107 bp – 4.8 × 
 109 bp), sufficient to cover the microbial diversity of skin samples24. We 
mapped the cleaned sequencing reads to our reference genome set, which consists of 1,252 bacterial and 272 
fungal genomes from the HMP reference genome database and several additional genomes of skin microor-
ganisms: Propionibacterium avidum25,26, Propionibacterium granulosum26, Propionibacterium humerusii27, and 
 
P. acnes bacteriophage28,29. To cover different P. acnes strains, we also included the P. acnes pan-genome in the ref-
erence19. Consistent with other skin sites23, bacteria were the major organisms found in the follicle (Fig. 1A) with 
few fungal organisms detected at low relative abundances (Fig. 1B,C). Five main bacterial phyla were found in 
the samples, including Actinobacteria (95.6%), Firmicutes (2.3%), Proteobacteria (1.2%), Cyanobacteria (0.6%),

individuals combined (n = 34). (B) A few fungal organisms were found in the follicle. Sequencing reads pooled

P. granulosum was observed in the healthy individuals, whereas an increase in the average relative abundances of 
minor taxa was observed in the acne group. Five major skin bacterial species (P. acnes, P. humerusii, P. avidum, 
P. granulosum, and S. epidermidis) are shown separately from the phyla that they belong to.

and Bacteroidetes (0.2%). The dominance of Actinobacteria in the follicle is consistent with previous taxonomic 
analyses of sebaceous skin sites5,23,30.
At the species level, P. acnes was the most prevalent and abundant. It was found in all 68 individuals with 
an average relative abundance of 91.0% (Fig. 1D; Table 1). The healthy individuals had a slightly higher relative 
abundance of P. acnes than the acne patients (93.8% vs. 88.5%). We also compared the differences in P. acnes strain 
populations between acne patients and healthy individuals. The relative abundances of the dominant P. acnes 
strains were assigned based on the read coverages of the 16S rRNA SNPs that distinguish the ten most com-
mon (top ten) P. acnes ribotypes (RTs)5 (Fig. S2). We found that acne patients had a higher diversity of P. acnes 
population (Shannon index = 
 1.07) with more RTs (2.55 RTs per individual) than healthy individuals (Shannon 
index = 
 0.79, P = 
 0.039; 1.97 RTs per individual, P = 
 0.007). Consistent with our previous study5, RT4, RT5, and 
RT8 were found to be more abundant and more prevalent in acne patients, with RT4 being statistically signifi-
cantly different in relative abundance (P = 
 0.004), while RT2 and RT6 were more abundant in healthy individuals 
(Fig. S2). The strain association with acne or healthy skin is consistent with previous multi-locus sequence typing 
and 16S ribotype analysis of large collections of clinical P. acnes isolates5,31,32.
Other cutaneous Propionibacterium species, including P. humerusii (2.7%), P. granulosum (1.6%), and 
P. avidum (0.4%), were also detected (Table 1). Among them, P. granulosum, a resident bacterium of seba-
ceous skin sites33, was significantly more abundant in the healthy individuals than in the acne patients 
(P = 0.002). 
Other bacterial species frequently identified in the follicle microbiota include Staphylococcus epidermidis 
(0.9%), Staphylococcus capitis (0.4%), Escherichia coli (0.7%), and Clostridium sp. (0.5%). Minor bacterial taxa 
were found more prevalent and abundant in acne patients than in healthy individuals with varying presence 
and abundance (Supplementary Text). On average, acne patients had a higher diversity at the species level than 
healthy individuals, but not statistically significantly different (Shannon index = 
 0.63 and 0.44, respectively; 
P = 
 0.072). Reduced P. acnes and P. granulosum and increased minor taxa observed in acne patients suggest dis-
ruptions of the commensal skin flora in acne development.
The skin microbiome of older healthy individuals is similar to younger healthy individuals. 
 
Acne rarely occurs in individuals over the age of 5010,11. The skin microbiome profiles of older individuals with clear 
skin can be used as independent references for healthy, acne-free skin. However, the skin metagenome of older 
healthy individuals has not been characterized. We performed metagenomic shotgun sequencing of the samples 
collected from four healthy individuals of age 55–79 (Fig. S1). The bacterial compositions of the follicular micro-
biome of these individuals were similar to those of the younger healthy individuals (Fig. 1D). It was previously 
noted that the production of sebum, a nutrient source for lipophilic bacteria, including Propionibacterium species, 
decreases with age34. In our analysis we found that the relative abundances of both P. acnes and P. granulosum 
 
were higher in older healthy individuals than in acne patients (Table 1), similar to the observations seen in 
younger healthy individuals. When grouping all healthy individuals together, P. granulosum remained signif-
icantly more abundant in healthy skin than acne (P = 
 0.001). At the strain level, P. acnes populations in older 
healthy individuals were similar to those of the younger healthy cohort, consisting of mostly RT1, RT2, and RT3 
strains, with little or no RT4, RT5, and RT8 strains detected (Fig. S2).
When comparing all 34 healthy individuals, including the four subjects over the age of 55, with the 38 acne 
patients, we found an increased prevalence and abundance of P. acnes phage in the healthy group (P = 
 0.05) 
(Fig. 1A). We also observed a trend between age and the relative abundance of P. acnes phage. Higher relative 
abundances of phage were found more often in individuals with increased age (Fig. 1C).

Metagenomic composition of the skin microbiome is different between acne patients and 
healthy individuals. 
To better understand the role of the follicular microbiota in acne pathogenesis at the 
molecular level, we investigated the differences in metagenomic composition of the microbiome between acne 
patients and healthy individuals. Among the sequencing reads mapped to P. acnes, we identified 2,707 operational 
gene units (OGUs) in the samples, among which 1,943 OGUs (72%) were present in every sample. Rarefaction 
analysis indicated that the sequencing depth was sufficient to quantitatively compare the P. acnes functional pro-
files between acne patients and healthy individuals (Fig. S3). Since the microbiome profiles were similar between 
younger and older healthy individuals at both the species and P. acnes strain level, we combined the healthy indi-
viduals from both age groups in the following metagenomic analyses.
To determine whether specific metagenomic elements are associated with acne or healthy skin, we compared 
the relative abundances of P. acnes OGUs between acne patients and healthy individuals (Fig. S4). As the skin 
microbiome varies greatly among individuals23,30,35,36, to reduce the potential bias due to specific individuals 
recruited in our study, we randomly selected 100 subsets of the data, each containing two-thirds of the individuals 
from each clinical group (26 acne patients and 22 healthy individuals), and determined the metagenomic elements 
that were differentially abundant between the two groups in each random set. To capture the differences at the 
species level between the two cohorts, in addition to P. acnes OGUs, we also considered the species found in the 
samples as additional metagenomic elements and included them in the analysis. To determine the most robust 
set of metagenomic elements that are associated with either acne or healthy skin, we identified 63 metagenomic 
elements, whose relative abundances were significantly different (P < 
 0.05) between the two groups in at least 50 of 
the 100 random subsets. These 63 elements consisted of 62 P. acnes OGUs (Table S1) and P. granulosum as species.
Among the 62 P. acnes OGUs, 25 were significantly more abundant in acne patients. Two of them are involved 
in thiopeptide bacteriocin precursor synthesis and transport (PAGK2104 and PAGK2105, as annotated in P. 
acnes HL096PA1 genome). Thiopeptide bacteriocins belong to a family of microcins, which are produced by 
Gram-positive bacteria and inhibit the growth of other Gram-positive species by blocking protein translation37. 
Additionally, 19 of the 25 acne-associated OGUs were from locus 2 (PAGK0160-PAGK0178), a genomic island 
previously identified mainly in RT4 and RT5 strains and highly associated with acne5,20. Locus 2 spans over 20 Kb 
and encodes 23 ORFs (Fig. S5). The differentially abundant locus 2 OGUs identified include a number of genetic 
elements involved in recombination, such as a single-strand binding like protein (Ssb), shown in other bacterial 
species to be involved in chromosomal transformation38, and resolvase-like protein, previously implicated in 
genetic integration. Other OGUs include a cluster of Streptolysin S-associated genes (sag) involved in the bio-
synthesis and transport of a bacterial toxin. Identified and characterized in Streptococcus pyogenes, sag genes are 
involved in synthesis, post-translational modification, and transport of a ribosomally synthesized bacteriocin, 
which has been linked to antimicrobial activity as well as invasive infections39,40. The presence of genes homolo-
gous to sagB, C, and D in locus 2 suggests involvement of this locus in bacteriocin biosynthesis and maturation. 
Additionally self-immunity and transport genes are found immediately downstream. Other OGUs in this locus 
have putative roles in cell viability, virulence, and immunity including ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter 
and ABC-binding protein for translocation of lipids, nutrients and/or toxins, CAAX amino protease, which is 
thought to be involved in self-immunity41, and partitioning machinery needed for cell replication and division. 
While the specific functions of genes in this locus in acne are unclear, the absence of locus 2 in healthy individuals 
and a high abundance in acne patients provides strong evidence for its association with acne.
In addition to locus 2, in our previous studies, two other genomic loci (locus 1 and locus 3) were found 
enriched in acne-associated RT4 and RT5 strains5,19,20. To examine whether these three loci were overrepresented 
in the metagenome of acne patients, we plotted the relative abundance (Fig. 2A), the fold change between acne 
patients and healthy individuals (Fig. 2B), and the prevalence ratio (Fig. 2C), of each OGU encoded in these three 
loci across all individuals. We found a higher average relative abundance and prevalence of all three loci in acne 
patients compared to healthy individuals (Fig. 2). Locus 2 was rarely found in the microbiome of the healthy 
individuals, and was significantly associated with acne (P = 
 0.002) (Fig. 2). Since most RT4 and RT5 strains har-
bor locus 2 and are resistant to antibiotics5,19, we examined the treatment history of each individual to determine 
whether the presence of locus 2 was due to acne treatment. While locus 2 was found in some treated acne patients 
(n = 
 8), it was absent in other treated patients (n = 
 8) and was present in many untreated patients (n = 
 10). The 
presence of locus 2 was not significantly different between treated and untreated patients (Fisher’s exact test, 
P = 
 1), suggesting that locus 2 is a characteristic of the disease rather than treatment (Fig. 2A). Additional anal-
ysis to further support the association of locus 2 with the disease is described in the supporting text (Fig. S6; 
Supplementary Text).
Of the 62 differentially abundant P. acnes OGUs, 37 OGUs were more abundant in healthy individuals. In 
contrast to the enrichment of virulence-related genes observed in the acne metagenome, genes involved in 
microbial metabolism and nutrient biosynthesis were significantly more abundant in the healthy metagenome 
(Fig. S4). Examples include glycosyl transferase (PAGK0136), D-alanine–D-alanine ligase (PAGK0821), and 
cobalamin-independent methionine synthase (PAGK1035), which are involved in polysaccharide, cell wall, and 
amino acid biosynthesis, respectively. An enrichment of these genes in the healthy metagenome is consistent with 
the metagenomic study by Mathieu et al.22, which suggested a functional role of the resident bacteria in healthy 
skin in the exploitation of compounds from the human skin including sugars, lipids, and iron22. Other signifi-
cantly more abundant OGUs in the healthy metagenome include glycerol uptake facilitator protein (PAGK2214), 
which aids in carbohydrate metabolism processes by transporting glycerol across the cytoplasmic membrane. 
Recently it was shown that fermentation of glycerol by P. acnes contributes to skin and host health via the produc-
tion of short chain fatty acids (SCFA)42. SCFA including acetic acid, lactic acid, and propionic acid were shown to 
significantly decrease the colonization of skin-associated pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
aureus42.

The balance between acne- and health-associated metagenomic elements shapes the host 
skin microbiota in acne and health. 
Our observations of differentially abundant species, strains, and 
metagenomic elements between the skin microbiome of acne patients and healthy individuals led us to hypoth-
esize that the balance between acne- and health-associated metagenomic elements determines the virulence and 
health properties of the microbiota in skin disease and health. We define the balance as the ratio between the 
relative abundances of acne- and health-associated metagenomic elements. When the relative abundances of the 
62 P. acnes OGUs and P. granulosum from all individuals were compared, we found that this ratio in acne patients 
was significantly higher than in healthy individuals (P = 
 2.9 × 
 10−5). Figure 3 illustrates the relative abundances 
of these 63 metagenomic elements across all 72 individuals. The metagenomic profiles of healthy individuals 
were readily distinguishable from acne patients harboring locus 2. Acne patients with locus 2 had significantly 
higher relative abundances of acne-associated OGUs (in 24 of 25 OGUs P = 0.00024–0.021, and in 1 of 25 OGUs 
P = 
 0.083) (Fig. 3A). However, these subjects only represented about half (47%) of the patients recruited in our 
study. When we examined the metagenomic profiles of the other acne patients without locus 2, we found that they 
were distinct from healthy individuals with decreased relative abundances of health-associated P. acnes OGUs (in 
23 of 37 OGUs P = 
 0.0024–0.046, and in 14 of 37 OGUs P = 
 0.058–0.30). We were able to reveal distinct microbi-
ome profiles between acne patients and healthy individuals that were not readily apparent at the taxonomic level, 
with differences in the relative abundances of the metagenomic elements that were associated with either acne or 
healthy skin (Fig. 3).
In addition to P. acnes OGUs, we found that the relative abundances of P. acnes and P. granulosum were also 
important factors influencing the clinical state of the skin. As an example, an acne patient in our cohort (labeled 
with † on Fig. 3) displayed a profile of the 62 P. acnes OGUs that was more similar to the healthy individuals than 
all other acne patients (P = 
 5.29 × 
 10−5). However, the observed low relative abundances of both P. acnes (78% 
compared to the average of 91%) and P. granulosum (0.070% compared to the average of 1.6%) may contribute to 
the acne status of this patient. This suggests that a healthy follicular microbiota not only requires health-associated 
P. acnes strains and genetic elements, but also requires significant dominance of resident propionibacteria. Taken 
together, our findings suggest that the balance between skin metagenomic elements determines the virulence and 
health properties of the skin microbiota and is important in skin health and disease.

We further investigated whether the relative abundance profiles of the metagenomic elements are sufficiently 
robust to correctly classify the clinical state of skin samples. We performed a supervised class prediction analysis 
based on a modified weighted gene voting algorithm43,44 (Supplementary Text). We generated 1,000 permuta-
tions. In each permutation, samples were randomly assigned to either acne or healthy state, with 38 samples in 
the acne group and 34 samples in the healthy group. We identified differentially abundant metagenomic elements 
between the two groups among all but one sample, and predicted the clinical state of the withheld sample based 
on the abundance profiles of the metagenomic element, known as the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). 
With the use of the clinically defined acne-healthy grouping, the algorithm predicted the clinical states of 49 out 
of 72 samples (68%) with a prediction strength threshold of 0.25. Thirty-four of the 49 samples were assigned cor-
rectly (69% accuracy). The number of correctly assigned samples based on the clinical grouping was higher than 
most of the permutated groupings (P = 
 0.064). The clinical grouping also had a significantly higher prediction 
accuracy (69%) than all but one of the permutated groupings (P = 0.001) (Fig. 4A).
We further improved our classifier by using the 63 metagenomic elements, which are the most robust set based 
on the 100 random samplings as described earlier. Since the 19 OGUs from locus 2 had similar abundance profiles 
across all samples, to avoid overweighing locus 2 in the classification, we combined these 19 OGUs and used their 
average relative abundance in the classifier. The refined classifier therefore consisted of the abundance profiles 
of 45 metagenomic elements: P. acnes OGUs/loci, and P. granulosum. Based on this refined set, we were able to 
assign the clinical states of 31 of the 38 acne patients (82%, prediction strength threshold of 0.25). Twenty-four 
acne patients were correctly assigned (accuracy of 77%). Among the healthy individuals, we were able to assign 
21 of the 34 subjects (62%) with 20 correctly assigned (accuracy of 95%). Overall, the classifier was able to assign 
72% of the subjects with an accuracy of 85% (Fig. 3B; Fig. 4B).
Furthermore, to validate that these metagenomic elements can be used as markers for clinical classification, 
we collected an “independent sample set” from ten additional subjects, including 4 acne patients and 6 healthy 
individuals, one of which was over 50 years old. We used the refined 45 metagenomic elements to predict the 
clinical state of each independent sample (Fig. 4B). Our classifier was able to assign the clinical states of 7 samples 
(70%) with an accuracy of 86%, highly consistent with the classification results from the training sample set of 72

in health and acne. Each column represents an individual, and each row represents an OGU or an organism.

samples. Based on this, we conclude that the metagenomic elements identified in our study can be used to classify 
the clinical state of the skin with high accuracy.
Discussion
The role of the human cutaneous microbiota in skin health and disease is not yet fully understood. In acne, the 
dominant bacterial species, P. acnes, has been believed to have a causal role15,16. However, the dominance of this 
species on healthy skin with a role in preventing the colonization of skin pathogens has long been a concern when 
trying to establish a link between P. acnes and acne pathogenesis5,45,46. The distinction in acne or health associa-
tions among different lineages of P. acnes strains was elucidated recently5,19,20 and partially addressed this concern. 
However, it is still unclear what impact on skin health or disease the skin microbiota exerts when multiple P. acnes 
strains coexist in the community.
In this study, we performed ultra-deep metagenomic shotgun sequencing of the samples collected from acne 
patients and young and older healthy individuals to quantitatively compare the microbiome differences between 
disease and health at the metagenomic level. To our knowledge, this is the first study in which the skin metagen-
ome in a diseased state as well as in older healthy individuals has been analyzed. With a relatively large number 
of subjects, our ultra-deep shotgun sequencing provided a high coverage of the metagenome (equivalent to an 
average of 422X coverage of the P. acnes genome per sample), which allowed quantitative characterization of the 
skin microbiome. We discovered that while the skin microbiome was highly variable among individuals, there 
were significant differences in the relative abundances of certain species, strains, and metagenomic elements 
between healthy and diseased states.
We revealed a trend of higher relative abundances of P. acnes and P. granulosum in healthy individuals com-
pared to acne patients (Fig. 1D; Table 1). This is contrary to what has been long believed and suggests a potential 
probiotic role of these two species in maintaining healthy skin. Early studies suggested the involvement of both 
P. acnes and P. granulosum in acne pathogenesis because of frequent isolations of these species from the follicles 
of acne patients47–49. More recently, however, using immuno-fluorescence microscopy, P. acnes and P. granulosum 
were identified in the follicles of healthy subjects at a similar prevalence to that of acne patients50. Our finding of 
a higher relative abundance of these species in healthy skin suggests that P. acnes and P. granulosum are essential 
members of the healthy skin microbial community. A beneficial role of propionibacteria in the skin microbiota is 
consistent with skin microbiome studies of other skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, in which 
the abundance of propionibacteria was reduced in the diseased states and increased after treatment3,6,51.
The high relative abundances of P. acnes and P. granulosum observed in healthy individuals suggest a role for 
these species in skin health. Propionibacterium species are thought to confer health benefits via the production 
Figure 4. Class prediction accuracy using leave-one-out cross-validation and weighted gene-voting. (A) 
For the training sample set (n = 72), using the clinically defined acne and healthy individual grouping, the 
classifier correctly assigned the clinical states of 34 of the 49 assigned samples (69% accuracy) using a prediction 
strength threshold of 0.25. This result is statistically significant (P = 0.001), because only one of the 1,000 
permutated groupings had a higher accuracy. However, that particular grouping (accuracy of 72%) had fewer 
samples assigned than the clinical grouping (n = 39 vs 49). This demonstrates that the differences in the relative 
abundances of the metagenomic elements between acne patients and healthy individuals can be used to predict 
the clinical states of the skin. When we used the refined set of 45 metagenomic elements, including 43 P. acnes 
OGUs, P. acnes locus 2, and P. granulosum, we further improved the prediction accuracy of the training sample 
set to 85%. (B) Consistent with the prediction accuracy on the training sample set, for the independent sample 
set (n = 10), the 45 metagenomic elements were able to assign 70% of the samples with 86% accuracy.

of SCFA. SCFA possess antimicrobial properties and contribute to the acidic pH of the skin in defending against 
pathogens42,52,53. Disruption in the normal skin pH has been linked to several skin diseases, including atopic 
dermatitis, ichthyosis, fungal infections54–57, and acne58. As propionibacteria play important roles in skin health, 
our finding suggests that effective acne treatments should not aim to kill all Propionibacterium in the follicle, as 
practiced in most of the current acne treatments, but rather to target pathogenic strains and keep or supplement 
the beneficial strains to maintain a healthy state of the skin.
Compared to P. acnes, much less is known about the role of P. granulosum in skin health and disease. Limited 
genomic information exists for P. granulosum. Previous comparative analysis based on two draft genomes 
revealed that, compared to P. acnes, P. granulosum lacks virulence-related factors such as CAMP factors and 
sialidases, and exhibits no neuraminidase and hyaluronidase activities26. The bacterium may provide protection 
to the skin with less production of virulence-associated elements. Further study to elucidate the potential health 
benefits of P. granulosum in the skin microbiota is warranted.
In the analysis of the skin microbiome in healthy individuals, we revealed, for the first time, a positive corre-
lation between P. acnes phage abundance and subject age as well as a link between phage abundance and healthy 
skin (Fig. 1C). This finding potentially could explain in part why the prevalence of acne declines with age10. The 
observed reduction of acne prevalence in older individuals10,11 may be a result of increased abundance of P. acnes 
phage, in addition to changes in the ecological niche such as reduced sebum and thus reduced propionibacteria 
load in the follicle34. Our findings are consistent with previous culture-based observation of a higher frequency 
of P. acnes phage isolated from healthy individuals than acne patients29, suggesting a role for P. acnes phage in 
acne-free skin, potentially by modulating P. acnes strain populations in the follicular microbiota. Despite being 
utilized for almost a century in Eastern Europe as a treatment for acne and other diseases59, few studies have 
been performed to understand the pray-predator interactions and dynamics between Propionibacterium species/
strains and P. acnes phage populations in the skin microbial community29. The observation of increased phage 
abundance in healthy individuals merits further investigation of the role of P. acnes phage in skin health. Our 
findings suggest that it is potentially promising to design personalized and strain-specific phage-based treatment 
that can target specific P. acnes strains and thus shift the strain composition to a healthy skin microbiota29.
To understand the role of the skin microbiota in skin health and acne at the molecular level, we identified a 
robust set of metagenomic elements that are differentially abundant between the two groups and can be used as 
markers for classification of the clinical states of the skin. In our analysis, the clinical states of most of the individ-
uals were accurately classified based on the 45 metagenomic elements, including the training set samples from 72 
subjects and the 10 independent samples not used in the identification of the metagenomic markers. Given the 
large individual variations in the skin microbiome, and that acne is a multi-factorial disease with bacteria account-
ing for only one of the mechanisms, our finding that the metagenome of the follicular microbiota can be used to 
classify the host skin states is significant. Furthermore, our results suggest that it is promising to develop reliable 
markers based on the skin metagenome to improve diagnosis, skin health monitoring, and disease prognosis.
Among the 72 subjects in our study cohort, 20 could not be assigned with confidence using the classifier. One 
explanation is that acne is a disease with a wide spectrum of severity and that the skin microbiome is reflective 
of this large variation. Although individuals presented with acne or healthy skin at the time of sampling, the fol-
licular microbiome might have been in the transition between the two clinical states. In support of this theory, 
we observed that the patients with mild acne (with acne score 1–2) were often not assigned with confidence or 
incorrectly assigned by our classifier. On the other hand, the majority of the patients with moderate or severe acne 
(with acne score 3–5) were assigned with high accuracy (Fig. 3). Consistently, in our independent validation sam-
ple set, two of the four acne patients who had a low acne score of “1” could not be assigned with confidence, while 
the other two patients with scores of “2” and “4”, respectively, were correctly assigned (Fig. 4B). Additionally, 
acne is a multi-factorial disease. Other factors including environment, host genetic predisposition, age, hormone 
status, and life style are also thought to play a role in acne pathogenesis60–63. Better understanding of these factors 
will help improve the classification of the disease.
Our findings from the metagenomic shotgun analysis of the follicular microbiome suggest that the balance 
between acne- and health-associated species and metagenomic elements of the skin microbiota contributes 
to skin health and disease. We observed that when less acne- and/or more health- associated microbial ele-
ments were present, an individual had healthy skin. On the other hand, when the balance shifted towards more 
acne-associated elements, the disease state prevailed. This concept of a disrupted balance in the metagenomic ele-
ments of the microbiota contributing to disease, and potentially disease severity, is largely different from the tra-
ditional definition of microorganism-associated diseases. Diseases associated with microorganisms are typically 
linked to the presence of a particular species or strains, ignoring other members of the resident community64,65. 
In this study, we raise a new viewpoint of microbial pathogenesis in acne, whereby the pathogenesis is not due to 
the presence of one particular species or strain but rather the balance of the overall microbial community, which 
leads to skin health or the development of acne. The mere presence of a disease-associated species or strain or 
genetic element may not necessarily confer the disease, depending on the commensal members of the commu-
nity. This balance-based model for microbial pathogenesis fits well for acne, a prevalent multi-factorial disease 
that exhibits a wide spectrum of severity amongst the general population. We believe that this new viewpoint 
based on the balance of the microbiota will provide novel insights on other similar microorganism-associated 
diseases. Additionally, our findings suggest potential future development of personalized and targeted therapies 
in the treatment of acne and the maintenance of skin health by supplementing the skin microbiota with probiotic 
organisms to shift the balance toward a healthy microbiome.
Materials and Methods
Subjects. 
Similar to that previously described5, in this study, subjects with acne or healthy skin were recruited 
from various clinics in Southern California, USA, including private practice, managed care, and public hospital 
 www.nature.com/scientificreports/

settings, as well as outside of dermatology clinics, to best represent the diversity of populations and history of 
medical care. The diagnosis of acne was made by board-certified dermatologists. The presence of acne was graded 
on a scale of 0 to 5 according to the Global Acne Severity Scale66. Grades were recorded for both the face and the 
nose separately, where zero represents healthy skin and 5 represents the most severe inflammatory cystic acne. 
The presence of scarring was also noted. Subjects with healthy skin were determined by board-certified dermatol-
ogists and were defined as people who had no acneiform lesions on the face, chest, and back. They were excluded 
if they had other skin conditions that the investigators felt would affect sampling or the microbial population on 
the skin. Additionally, healthy subjects were excluded if they had been previously treated for acne. Among 72 
subjects recruited, 38 were acne patients with an average age of 24 years (14–37 years; Fig. S1) and had an average 
acne score on the face and nose of 2.4 (range 1–5) and 0.6 (range 0–2), respectively. Of the 34 healthy individuals, 
30 were age-matched, with an average of 26 years old (16–38 years; Fig. S1), and four were over the age of 55, with 
an average of 67.5 years (55–79 years; Fig. S1). The subjects responded to a written questionnaire, administered 
by a physician or a well-trained study coordinator who went over each question with the subjects. Of the acne 
patients, 16 received acne treatments during or prior to the study, including antibiotics, benzoyl peroxide, and 
topical retinoids (Fig. 2). Clinical information of the study participants and the histograms of age distribution of 
acne patients and healthy individuals are shown in Figure S1. All subjects provided written informed consent. All 
protocols and consent forms were approved by both the UCLA and Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute 
IRBs. The study was conducted in adherence to the Helsinki Guidelines.
Sample collection and genomic DNA extraction. 
Sample collection and processing were performed 
as previously described5. Briefly, skin follicle samples were taken from the nose of the subjects using Bioré Deep 
Cleansing Pore Strip (Kao Brands Company, Cincinnati, OH) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Clean 
gloves were used for each sampling. To avoid sample cross-contamination, strict sterile working conditions were 
enforced, including appropriate lab-wear and routine sterilization of the working surfaces and equipment. After 
being removed from the nose, the strip was immediately placed into a 50 ml sterile tube and kept on ice or at 
4 °C. Samples were processed within 24 hours of collection. Individual follicular plugs were manually picked 
from the adhesive strip with sterile forceps and placed into 2 ml sterile microcentrifuge tubes filled with ATL 
buffer (Qiagen) and glass beads (0.1 mm diameter) (BioSpec Products Inc., Bartlesville, OK). Cells were lysed 
using a beadbeater for 3 minutes at 4,800 rpm at room temperature, then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 minutes. 
The supernatant was retrieved and used for genomic DNA (gDNA) extraction using QIAamp DNA micro kit 
(Qiagen). The manufacturer protocol for extracting genomic DNA from chewing gum was used. DNA extraction 
reagents were routinely tested for potential contaminations using negative control extractions. Concentration 
of gDNA was determined using Qubit Fluorometric Quantitation (Invitrogen). Concentrations from negative 
control experiments were below the detectable range.
Library construction and metagenomic shotgun sequencing. 
Genomic sequencing libraries were 
prepared using NexteraXT kit (Illumina). Briefly, 1 ng of extracted metagenomic DNA was tagmented using 
transposase technology. 5′ 
 and 3′ NexteraXT dual-indices were added to uniquely barcode each library. Indexed 
libraries were amplified using the limited 12-cycle PCR program as instructed by the manufacturer’s guidelines. 
Libraries were purified with Agencourt AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter). Library quality and 
average fragment length were assessed using Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Libraries were quantified 
with KAPA library quantification kit (KAPA Biosystems), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Finally, 
libraries were randomly pooled together and sequenced using MiSeq and/or HiSeq platforms (Illumina) with 
paired-end reads of 251 bp or 101 bp, respectively. Following sequencing, reads were de-multiplexed.
Data cleaning and sequencing depth analysis. 
Data cleaning of the metagenomic shotgun sequences 
was performed following the protocol used in the HMP21. Briefly, low quality reads and human DNA reads were 
filtered out first. Human reads accounted for 43% of the sequencing data. In total, 78 Gbp of cleaned, host free 
sequencing data were obtained for 72 samples. The average number of mappable reads per sample was 7.2 × 
 106 
(4.0 × 
 105–4.7 × 
 107 reads), accounting for 72.6 ± 
 3.0% of the cleaned, host free data. These data were used in 
the downstream analyses. To ensure adequate sequencing coverage, we performed sequencing depth analyses. 
Rarefaction curves were plotted, demonstrating sufficient sequencing depth of P. acnes OGUs for functional pro-
filing (Fig. S3).
Taxonomic composition analysis. 
We determined the taxonomic composition of the microbiome 
by mapping metagenomic shotgun sequences against microbial reference genomes, using a method simi-
lar to that described by Schloissnig et al.67. In addition to the HMP reference genomes, we included additional 
Propionibacterium genomes and P. acnes phage genomes. Fungal genomes from NCBI non-redundant nucleotide 
database (RefSeq release 48) were also included. Bowtie2 was used in mapping the shotgun reads with 80% identity 
threshold68. The relative abundance of each taxon in each sample was calculated by counting the number of base 
pairs covering the genome of the organism, normalized by the genome size and the sequencing depth of the sam-
ple. To identify common taxa in the population that were either associated with acne or healthy skin, we performed 
statistical analysis on only the species that were identified in at least 20% of the individuals of our study cohort.
P. acnes pan-genome and OGUs. 
P. acnes pan-genome was constructed based on the genomes of 80 P. acnes 
strains, as described by Tomida et al.19. The set of P. acnes OGUs was constructed similarly as described by Hansen 
et al.69 with minor modification. Using CD-HIT70, genes in P. acnes genomes were binned based on their nucleotide 
sequences with 80% identity threshold. The relative abundance of each OGU was calculated as the total base pair 
coverage within the OGU region normalized by the OGU length and the sequencing depth of P. acnes genomes in 
each sample. The presence of an OGU in a sample was defined as more than 1X coverage after normalization.

Functional classification of P. acnes OGUs. 
P. acnes OGUs were annotated with KEGG orthologous 
groups (KOs) by mapping them to the KEGG database71 (version 54; e-value < 
 10−5) using BLAST, in a procedure 
similar to that described by Shi et al.72. The relative abundance of each functional category in each sample was 
calculated by summing all the functional genes involved in each functional category.
Identification of differentially abundant OGUs and species. 
To minimize the potential bias due to 
a few individuals in the acne and healthy groupings, we used a resampling approach in identifying differentially 
abundant OGUs and species between acne patients and healthy individuals. We randomly selected two thirds 
of the samples in each group (26/38 in the acne group and 22/34 in the healthy group) and compared them to 
identify metagenomic elements that were significantly different in relative abundance between the two groups 
(P < 
 0.05, Student’s t-test). We repeated this sub-sampling and comparison 100 times and identified the OGUs 
and species that were differentially abundant in at least 50 of the 100 samplings.
Classification of clinical states based on the metagenomic profile. 
The supervised classifica-
tion was performed using the weighted gene-voting algorithm with minor modification and leave-one-out 
cross-validation as described by Golub et al.43 and Bleharski et al.44. The top 25 differentially abundant metagen-
omic elements were used for leave-one-out classification in each permutation. More details of the method are 
described in the Supplementary Text.
Independent sample set for validation. 
An additional ten subjects were recruited and sampled, using 
the same sampling method described above. Four samples were collected from acne patients (average age 24.5 
years), and six samples were collected from individuals with healthy skin: five age-matched subjects (average 
age 33.4 years) and one older subject (77 years old). Samples were sequenced to a comparable sequencing depth 
(average of 8.04 × 
 108 bp per sample). The profiles of the 45 metagenomic elements identified from our study 
cohort were determined for each sample. Profiles based on these 45 metagenomic elements were used to classify 
each sample (Supplementary Text).
Statistical analysis. 
Statistical analyses were performed to calculate the differences between acne patients 
and healthy individuals at the species and strain levels using the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test (U-test). We corrected 
for multiple testing using the Bonferroni correction. Student’s t-test with two-tailed distribution was used in 
statistical testing of the differences in the relative abundance of P. acnes OGUs between the two groups. Pearson’s 
correlation was used to calculate the correlation co-efficient.
