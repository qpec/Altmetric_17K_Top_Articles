Abstract
Insulin modulates the biochemical pathways controlling lipid uptake, lipolysis and 
lipogenesis at multiple levels. Elevated insulin levels are associated with obesity, 
and conversely, dietary and pharmacological manipulations that reduce insulin have 
occasionally been reported to cause weight loss. However, the causal role of insulin 
hypersecretion in the development of mammalian obesity remained controversial 
in the absence of direct loss-of-function experiments. Here, we discuss theoretical 
considerations around the causal role of excess insulin for obesity, as well as recent 
studies employing mice that are genetically incapable of the rapid and sustained 
hyperinsulinemia that normally accompanies a high-fat diet. We also discuss new 
evidence demonstrating that modest reductions in circulating insulin prevent weight 
gain, with sustained effects that can persist after insulin levels normalize. Importantly, 
evidence from long-term studies reveals that a modest reduction in circulating insulin 
is not associated with impaired glucose homeostasis, meaning that body weight and 
lipid homeostasis are actually more sensitive to small changes in circulating insulin than 
glucose homeostasis in these models. Collectively, the evidence from new studies on 
genetic loss-of-function models forces a re-evaluation of current paradigms related to 
obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes. The potential for translation of these findings to 
humans is briefly discussed.
Phylogeny and complexity of insulin-like 
peptides and the insulin signaling network
Insulin/Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1)-like signaling 
is evolutionarily conserved, and its many functions 
are shared across species. This pathway plays a critical 
role in coordinating nutrient availability with energy 
storage, body size and longevity in both invertebrates 
and vertebrates (Fontana et al. 2010, van Heemst 2010, 
Rideout et al. 2015). Seminal studies have shown that 
worms or flies with reduced insulin peptides or insulin 
signaling are leaner and live longer (Kenyon et al. 1993, 
Clancy et al. 2001).
Invertebrates 
produce 
numerous 
insulin-like 
peptides: there are at least 38 genes encoding putative 
insulin-like peptides in Caenorhabditis elegans (Pierce et al. 
2001), and eight known genes in Drosophila melanogaster 
(Brogiolo et al. 2001). In mammals, the superfamily 
of insulin-like genes includes insulin, two insulin-like

growth factors (IGF1 and IGF2), relaxins (three relaxin 
genes in humans) and four additional insulin-like 
peptides (insulin-like peptides 3–6; Nakae et al. 2001, 
Shabanpoor et al. 2009, Fernandez & Torres-Aleman 2012). 
These mammalian peptides appear to be derived from 
a shared ancestral gene and have structural similarities, 
although the known biological functions of the majority 
of these peptides appear largely distinct from those of 
insulin and IGF1 (Shabanpoor et al. 2009). However, a 
recent study showed that insulin-like peptide 5 produced 
by enteroendocrine cells acts as an orexigenic hormone 
with circulating levels that change in response to feeding 
status, which suggests that this peptide also plays a role 
in coordinating energy homeostasis (Grosse et al. 2014).
Although most mammals and humans have only 
a single ‘insulin’ gene, mice and rats have two insulin 
peptides that are produced from separate insulin genes 
(Soares et al. 1985, Shiao et al. 2008). Ins2 is the ancestral 
insulin gene that is analogous to human INS, whereas 
rodent-specific Ins1 appears to have originated from the 
transposition of a reverse-transcribed, partially processed 
Ins2 mRNA (Soares et al. 1985). Fully processed INS1 and 
INS2 peptides differ at the level of two B-chain amino acids, 
with additional differences evident in their C-peptides 
(Wentworth et al. 1986). Despite sharing sequence 
homology upstream of the transcription initiation site 
(Wentworth et al. 1986, Melloul et al. 2002), Ins1 and 
Ins2 do have notable differences with respect to certain 
promoter elements, expression patterns, translational 
efficiency and imprinting status (Wentworth et al. 1986, 
Linde et al. 1989, Deltour et al. 1995, Hay & Docherty 
2006, Meur et al. 2011, Mehran et al. 2012). Ins2 can 
be detected earlier in murine development and has a 
broader tissue distribution (Deltour et al. 1993, Fan et al. 
2009, Mehran et al. 2012). Murine Ins1 expression and 
promoter activity are largely restricted to the pancreas 
(Mehran et al. 2012, Thorens et al. 2015), and it does 
not contribute as much to pancreatic insulin production 
as Ins2, except in the mouse embryo during the early 
stages of pancreatic development (Wentworth et al. 1986, 
Linde et al. 1989, Deltour et al. 1993, Bengtsson et al. 2005). 
Complete inactivation of both Ins genes in mice (i.e. 
Ins1−/−:Ins2−/−) leads to severe diabetes and death within 
several days of birth, or weeks after conditional insulin 
gene deletion (Duvillie et al. 1998, Szabat et al. 2016). 
However, genetic inactivation of either Ins gene alone 
has not been reported to be associated with significant 
metabolic deficiencies (Leroux et al. 2001, Mehran et al. 
2012, Templeman et al. 2015, 2016, Dionne et al. 2016). 
Instead, there is a partial compensatory elevation of 
mRNA and protein of the corresponding non-deleted 
Ins gene, and increased beta-cell mass, which suggests a 
degree of redundancy between Ins1 and Ins2 (Leroux et al. 
2001, Mehran et al. 2012, Templeman et al. 2015, 2016, 
Dionne et al. 2016). However, there is evidence to suggest 
that Ins1 may have been subjected to positive selective 
mechanisms to maintain the two-Ins gene system in mice 
(Shiao et al. 2008), and it is unclear whether INS1 and 
INS2 or their peptide products have distinct functional 
roles. In unpublished studies, we have found that Ins1 
and Ins2 peptides had similar biological activities using 
3T3L1 pre-adipocyte differentiation as an assay. We and 
others have taken advantage of the unique properties 
of the two insulin genes to gain novel insight into the 
biology of this essential hormone.
Mammalian 
insulin/IGF1 
signaling 
involves 
 
multiple receptors, and a network of signaling pathways 
can be triggered through activation of each receptor 
subtype, with the added complexity of interactions and 
crosstalk between the downstream pathways (White 2003, 
van Heemst 2010). The classical tyrosine kinase receptor 
ligands in mammals are insulin and IGF1, which bind with 
variable affinity to the primary mammalian insulin/IGF1 
tyrosine kinase receptors, consisting of the insulin receptor 
(IR), which has two functionally distinct splice isoforms 
(IRa and IRb), and the IGF1 receptor (IGF1R; van Heemst 
2010). Moreover, as these receptors are tetrameric proteins, 
functional hybrid heterodimers can form between insulin 
and IGF1 receptor subunits (e.g. IRa:IGF1R, IRb:IGF1R; 
van Heemst 2010). Receptor activation and subsequent 
phosphorylation of proximal effectors, such as the 
scaffolding proteins insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 1 or 
IRS2, initiate signal transduction via two major branches 
of insulin/IGF1 signaling: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 
(PI3K)/AKT and the mitogen-activated protein kinase 
(MAPK) pathways (Taniguchi et al. 2006). The precise 
mechanisms differentiating the downstream signaling 
of insulin receptors from IGF1 receptors have not been 
delineated (Nakae et al. 2001). However, insulin is widely 
considered to be the primary ligand of interest with respect 
to metabolic processes, despite the improbability of there 
being a complete divergence between the functions of 
insulin and IGF1 (Werner et al. 2008, Fu et al. 2013).
Insulin as a key metabolic hormone

maintaining energy homeostasis (Fontana et al. 2010,

(Banting et al. 1922), the majority of research pertaining 
to this hormone has revolved around the two diseases of 
absolute and relative insulin insufficiency, known as type 
1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, respectively. Lately, there 
has been a resurgence of interest in conditions associated 
with excessive insulin production. Hyperinsulinemia, 
which for the purpose of this review will broadly refer 
to elevated basal and/or stimulated insulin secretion, is 
associated with obesity, and is nearly universal in the 
early stages of type 2 diabetes (Tabak et al. 2009). However, 
these correlative associations do not provide information 
as to whether excess insulin might be a causal contributor 
to obesity and its associated complications.
Circulating insulin levels are rapidly adjusted in 
response to nutrients in the blood, including glucose, and 
undergo sustained basal alterations in response to chronic 
demand (Werner et al. 2008, Fu et al. 2013). The acute 
increase in circulating insulin induced by food intake 
promotes nutrient storage in its major peripheral target 
tissues, primarily by stimulating: (1) glucose uptake in 
adipose tissue and muscle; (2) glycolysis and glycogen 
synthesis in muscle and liver; (3) lipogenesis in adipose 
tissue and liver and (4) protein synthesis in muscle 
and liver. Conversely, insulin has repressive functions 
on glycogenolysis, lipolysis and protein breakdown, 
as well as gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis in the liver 
(Taniguchi et al. 2006, Cheng et al. 2010, Czech et al. 2013). 
Insulin may also exert local autocrine effects to promote 
beta-cell growth and survival, as well as influence its 
own production and secretion (Fig. 1; Luciani & Johnson 
2005, Johnson et al. 2006, Beith et al. 2008, Leibiger et al. 
2008, Mehran et al. 2012, Wang et al. 2013). In addition 
to its peripheral effects, insulin may affect energy balance 
and peripheral metabolism via central actions, such as 
through modulation of food intake; insulin signaling in 
the brain has been extensively reviewed elsewhere (e.g. 
Stockhorst et al. 2004, Schwartz & Porte 2005, Fernandez 
& Torres-Aleman 2012, Lee et al. 2016). Insulin clearly has 
essential roles in regulating energy balance and metabolic 
pathways, but there is still much to be learned about these 
and other critical functions of this hormone.
Hyperinsulinemia in the etiology of insulin 
resistance and type 2 diabetes
Type 2 diabetes is defined as chronically elevated blood 
glucose that results from insufficient insulin production 
or impaired responsiveness to insulin (McGarry 1992, 
Prentki & Nolan 2006). Underlying factors that contribute 
to both obesity and susceptibility to type 2 diabetes 
include genetic and epigenetic components, lifestyle and 
environmental conditions (McCarthy 2015). Chronic fuel 
surplus can lead to type 2 diabetes when there is a failure 
to compensate by adequately elevating insulin levels 
to meet demand (Prentki & Nolan 2006, Nolan et al. 
2013, 2015). A decline in beta-cell function and/or mass 
is required for the onset of full-blown diabetes, and 
progression toward this state appears to be perpetuated 
by the metabolic disruptions associated with impaired 
tissue responsiveness to circulating insulin (Prentki 
& Nolan 2006, Nolan et al. 2011, 2015, Fu et al. 2013, 
Johnson & Olefsky 2013). The term ‘insulin resistance’ is 
widely used to specify an impairment of glucose disposal 
in response to insulin stimulation; however, this term is 
misleading when used broadly, because not all insulin-
regulated processes are similarly affected in the insulin-
resistant state that is associated with glucose intolerance 
(Saltiel & Kahn 2001, Biddinger & Kahn 2006). It has 
also been proposed that mild insulin resistance can be 
beneficial and protective, at least early in the disease 
progression (Nolan et al. 2015). Insulin resistance within 
tissues can arise at multiple levels of the insulin signaling 
pathway (Johnson & Olefsky 2013). Insulin resistance can 
also be caused by insulin receptor desensitization and 
removal from the plasma membrane (Knutson et al. 1983, 
Boothe et al. 2016).
Peripheral insulin resistance is closely related to 
elevated circulating insulin levels (Prentki & Nolan 2006, 
Shanik et al. 2008), and both of these features are linked 
to glucose intolerance (Nolan et al. 2011, Fu et al. 2013, 
Johnson & Olefsky 2013). Insulin resistance may be 
modulated by oscillatory dynamics of insulin secretion 
(Marsh et al. 1986, Shanik et al. 2008), and indeed, the 
loss of pulsatile insulin secretion is one of the earliest 
detectable defects in individuals who are at risk for 
type 2 diabetes (O’Rahilly et al. 1988, Satin et al. 2015). 
Currently, it is unclear whether hyperinsulinemia or 
altered insulin secretion dynamics play causal roles in 
the progression of type 2 diabetes. Theoretically, relative 
hyperinsulinemia could be maladaptive by enhancing 
weight gain, contributing to beta-cell exhaustion, or by 
exacerbating insulin receptor desensitization (i.e. insulin 
resistance).
Another interesting possibility is that insulin 
resistance at the level of the beta-cells could play a role 
in hyperinsulinemia, obesity, insulin resistance and 
type 2 diabetes (Fig. 1). Knockout mice lacking Irs1 or 
Akt gene function exhibit basal hyperinsulinemia and, 
in some cases, increased beta-cell mass (Kido et al. 2000,

Bernal-Mizrachi et al. 2004), thereby mimicking the 
early stages in type 2 diabetes, but this concept should be 
tested directly with the insulin receptor and specific Cre 
deleter models. It has been shown that insulin acutely 
inhibits beta-cell electrical activity (Khan et al. 2001), 
meaning that local loss of insulin signaling might be 
expected to induce relative hyperinsulinemia. Indeed, 
insulin reduces its own secretion in healthy humans, 
but not in subjects that were obese (Cavallo-Perin et al. 
1993). Human islets isolated from donors with type 
2 diabetes were reported to have 50% reduced INSR 
expression (Gunton et al. 2005), but it is not known 
whether insulin receptors or insulin receptor signaling 
is affected in islets from hyperinsulinemic, obese, pre-
diabetic individuals.
Obesity is often associated with peripheral insulin 
resistance, and with hyperinsulinemia. Indeed, it is 
difficult to conceptually or experimentally separate the 
phenomena of hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. 
The commonly accepted paradigm proposes that the 
hyperbolic relationship between impairment of insulin-
stimulated glucose uptake and insulin secretion signifies 
that hyperinsulinemia is a compensatory response to 
prevent hyperglycemia when peripheral tissues are failing 
to take in excess glucose due to conditions resulting from 
obesity (Shanik et al. 2008). However, the chronology of 
obesity, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance is not 
always clear (Shanik et al. 2008). Characteristics of the 
obese state, such as toxic accumulation of lipids in non-
adipose tissue and increased levels of proinflammatory 
cytokines, can induce or exacerbate insulin resistance, 
and the resultant elevated blood glucose has the potential 
to stimulate increased insulin secretion (Saltiel & Kahn 
2001, Biddinger & Kahn 2006, Johnson & Olefsky 2013). 
On the other hand, clinical and experimental evidence 
indicates that hyperinsulinemia can precede and 
promote both obesity (Genuth et al. 1971, Odeleye et al. 
1997, Corkey 2012, Mehran et al. 2012) and insulin 
resistance or dysglycemia (Cusin et al. 1990, Le Stunff & 
Bougnères 1994, Dankner et al. 2009). Moreover, drugs 
that alleviate or prevent hyperinsulinemia can lead to 
weight loss (Alemzadeh et al. 1996, 1998, Lustig et al. 
2005) and can enhance insulin-stimulated glucose uptake 
(Alemzadeh et al. 1996, Gray et al. 2010, Pedersen et al. 
2015). Measured baseline insulin levels within healthy 
human and mouse populations are subject to wide 
variance (McAuley et al. 2001, Li et al. 2006, Berglund et al. 
2008, Templeman et al. 2016), and diet intervention 
studies have indicated that obese individuals with the 
highest insulin secretion respond best to diets that reduce 
postprandial glycemia and insulinemia, whereas obese 
subjects with relatively lower insulin levels experience 
equivalent weight loss on low-fat diets (Pittas et al. 2005, 
Ebbeling et al. 2007). Collectively, these studies suggest 
that insulin has more of a causal role in perpetuating 
obesity and peripheral insulin resistance than is 
widely supposed.
Direct mechanisms by which insulin may 
influence obesity
The expansion of white adipose tissue (WAT) that 
defines obesity can occur through both adipocyte 
hypertrophy (lipid filling) and hyperplasia (adipogenesis 
or increased differentiation of adipocyte precursor cells 
into adipocytes), but the mechanisms controlling these 
processes have not yet been fully delineated (Berry et al. 
2014, Lim et al. 2015). Biochemical studies have shown that 
insulin plays key roles in regulating white adipocyte lipid 
Figure 1
Insulin’s effects are exerted through direct actions 
on target cells such as adipocytes, and also 
through autocrine feed-back on beta-cells. The 
number and function of beta-cells dictate insulin 
secretion levels and patterns that control 
adipogenesis and lipid homeostasis.

accumulation, by inhibiting lipolysis as well as promoting 
fatty acid uptake and triglyceride synthesis (lipogenesis) 
and also by stimulating the expression of genes involved 
in lipid uptake and storage (Kersten 2001, Czech et al. 
2013) (Fig. 2). Over a longer term, insulin signaling 
can drive adipogenesis, an orchestrated progression of 
events involving transient expression of the transcription 
factors CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) β and 
C/EBPδ leading to induction of the master adipogenic 
regulators C/EBPα and peroxisome proliferator–activated 
receptor (PPAR) γ (Cook & Cowan 2008, Berry et al. 
2014, Lim et al. 2015). Recently, it has also been 
shown that hyperinsulinemia promotes adipose tissue 
inflammation in mice, which contributes to disruption of 
metabolic processes such as de novo lipogenesis in WAT 
(Pedersen et al. 2015). Although the mechanisms guiding 
WAT growth are not fully understood, insulin appears 
to have the potential to influence several prominent 
steps. Indeed, deletion of insulin receptors from WAT 
protects mice from obesity, demonstrating a fundamental 
requirement for insulin in adipocyte differentiation 
 
and/or hyperplasia and/or hypertrophy (Katic et al. 2007, 
Boucher et al. 2012, Softic et al. 2016).
There are multiple types of adipose tissue with 
distinct functions, spatial distribution and contributions 
to obesity, and it is not clear whether insulin affects all 
types of adipocytes similarly. WAT is the primary type of 
adipose tissue that serves as an energy reserve, and WAT 
also secretes an array of factors with autocrine, paracrine 
and endocrine functions (Berry et al. 2014). Subcutaneous 
and visceral depots of WAT have distinct characteristics, 
differing in cellular composition, innervation, metabolic 
characteristics and secretory profile; in general, visceral 
WAT is more implicated in perpetuating metabolic 
dysfunction, compared to subcutaneous WAT (Lee et al. 
2013, Lim et al. 2015). Interestingly, insulin treatment 
may have selective trophic effects on subcutaneous WAT 
when compared with visceral WAT in a rat model of late-
stage type 2 diabetes (Skovso et al. 2015). The mechanisms 
regulating the specific expansion of distinct WAT depots 
are not well understood, although physiological factors 
such as age and sex have an influence on adipose tissue 
distribution (Fuente-Martin et al. 2013, Lee et al. 2013, 
Jeffery et al. 2016, Kwok et al. 2016). For instance, central 
adiposity tends to increase with aging, and many of the 
pathologic conditions or diseases associated with obesity, 
including glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes, 
insulin resistance, a proinflammatory state, coronary 
heart disease, hypertension, atherosclerosis and some 
cancers, are also associated with aging (Ebbeling et al. 
2007). It seems that certain stages of life, such as the 
perinatal period and adolescence, are particularly

influential for determining the metabolic and adipocyte 
characteristics and thus shaping future susceptibility to 
obesity (Lawlor & Chaturvedi 2006, Buyken et al. 2014, 
Templeman et al. 2015).
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) and the brown-like 
adipocytes that can be found in some WAT depots 
are distinguished from WAT by a marked capacity to 
uncouple the electron transport chain-generated proton 
gradient from ATP synthesis, and thus expend energy 
through thermogenesis (Beranger et al. 2013). Although 
increasing the activity of BAT or expansion of brown-
like adipocytes has been proposed as a treatment for 
obesity, the overall contribution of BAT and brown-
like adipocytes to whole body metabolism is still being 
debated (Chondronikola et al. 2016, Labbe et al. 2016). 
BAT-specific insulin receptor knockout in mice results 
in the loss of fat-burning BAT tissue, illustrating an 
important role for insulin in this tissue (Guerra et al. 
2001). Overall, there is ample evidence supporting effects 
of insulin signaling in adipose tissue that could influence 
the onset and development of obesity.
Prevention of obesity in mice genetically 
incapable of sustained hyperinsulinemia
Although clinical and experimental evidence indicated 
that hyperinsulinemia could precede and promote obesity 
(Genuth et al. 1971, Odeleye et al. 1997, Corkey 2012), 
what was previously missing from the field was a genetic 
loss-of-function experiment in a mammalian model 
system that could directly establish the causal requirement 
for hyperinsulinemia in diet-induced obesity. To address 
this unmet need, we designed a series of studies in which 
we modulated the insulin gene dosage, and, to varying 
extents, levels of circulating insulin in mice (Mehran et al. 
2012, Templeman et al. 2015, 2016). The fact that mice 
have two insulin genes allowed us to compare effects 
over a range of insulin reductions, and to avoid the 
compensation that occurs between the two insulin genes.
In the first such study, we used mice that were null for 
the Ins2 gene to focus attention only on insulin coming 
from the pancreas (Mehran et al. 2012). Thus, on the 
Ins2-null background, we compared Ins1 heterozygous 
mice (Ins1+/−:Ins2−/− mice) to their littermate controls that 
had both Ins1 alleles (Ins1+/+:Ins2−/− mice) for one year, 
and we confirmed that the Ins1+/−:Ins2−/− mice exhibited 
the expected sustained reduction in circulating insulin, 
which was associated with reduced beta-cell mass. 
Remarkably, we found that male Ins1+/−:Ins2−/− mice were 
completely protected from diet-induced obesity, as well 
as related sequelae including fatty liver, over this time 
frame. We observed an increase in energy expenditure in 
mice with less insulin, associated with browning of WAT, 
but no differences in food intake. Interestingly, control 
female Ins1+/+:Ins2−/− mice did not develop significant 
hyperinsulinemia in a comparison between these high-
fat and moderate-fat diets, so we were unable to test our 
hypothesis in females. It should be noted that male and 
female mice with only a single Ins1 allele (on an Ins2-null 
background) had relatively normal glucose homeostasis 
when housed in our conventional facility (Mehran et al. 
2012), but diabetes is now found in over half of the male 
Ins1+/−:Ins2−/− mice after they were rederived into new 
‘modified 
barrier’ 
and 
‘specific 
pathogen-free’ 
facilities. 
The 
 
reason for this increased diabetes susceptibility in male 
mice with a single remaining Ins1 allele is not clear, but 
could be related to gut microbiota, environmental stresses 
or genetic drift within this strain. Notwithstanding, the 
results of this first study demonstrated for the first time 
in any mammal that hyperinsulinemia is required for 
weight gain.
In a second study, we studied female Ins1−/−:Ins2+/− 
experimental mice and their littermate Ins1−/−:Ins2+/+ 
controls for one year. In this experiment, reduced Ins2 
gene dosage led to a transient decrease in circulating 
insulin that was significant at 8 and 28 weeks, but 
had returned to hyperinsulinemic levels at one year 
(Templeman et al. 2015). This transient reduction of diet-
induced hyperinsulinemia provided sustained protection 
from obesity, although in this less-severe model of insulin 
reduction, we did not observe evidence of significant 
browning of WAT (Templeman et al. 2015). A pilot study 
provided evidence that partial normalization of INS2 
peptide levels, via mini-osmotic pump, was sufficient 
to partially reverse the protective anti-obesity effects of 
reducing Ins2 gene dosage.
Our third study focused on males with Ins1−/−:Ins2+/− 
and Ins1−/−:Ins2+/+ genotypes. In this case, circulating 
insulin levels were hypervariable compared with their 
female littermates, and were not significantly suppressed 
by reducing insulin gene dosage. The wide variation in 
circulating insulin in these male mice is similar to human 
populations and other mouse studies (Li et al. 2006, 
Berglund et al. 2008). Although this meant we could not 
test the hypothesis by comparing the body weight means 
between Ins1−/−:Ins2+/− mice and Ins1−/−:Ins2+/+ controls,

These three studies, alongside data from mice with 
insulin receptor knock-out in adipose tissue (Katic et al. 
2007, Boucher et al. 2012), strongly support the concept 
that excess insulin contributes to diet-induced obesity. 
Moreover, across multiple models, we found that obesity 
and lipid homeostasis are more sensitive to small changes 
in circulating insulin levels than glucose homeostasis. 
Collectively, these experiments also fit well with clinical 
and pre-clinical studies demonstrating that therapy 
with long-acting insulin analogues leads to weight gain, 
and with small trials showing weight loss with drugs 
that reduce insulin secretion (Alemzadeh et al. 1998, 
Lustig et al. 2005, ORIGIN Trial Investigators et al. 2012, 
Skovso et al. 2015). For example, a recent investigation 
reported that chronic insulin infusion via mini-osmotic 
pump leads to WAT expansion in mice (Rajan et al. 2016). 
Clearly, more work needs to be done, but the idea that 
insulin plays an important role in lipid homeostasis 
in vivo appears to be broadly supported.
Nutritional regulation of insulin secretion
Circulating insulin levels are affected by nutrients and 
numerous circulating factors, such as certain amino acids, 
fatty acids, sex hormones, melatonin, leptin, growth 
hormone, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide 
and glucagon-like peptide 1 (Melloul et al. 2002, Fu et al. 
2013). Insulin levels can be tempered through stimulation 
or repression of its secretion, and insulin production is 
also subject to modulation, at the level of transcription, 
mRNA stability, translation and processing (Melloul et al. 
2002, Fu et al. 2013). Basal insulin levels are also modulated 
chronically through changes in the number of beta-cells 
and their differentiation status (Szabat et al. 2012). One 
of the unexpected insights from our studies on insulin-
mutant mice is that although differences in gene dosage 
(and therefore insulin synthesis) usually translate into 
measurable changes in insulin secretion in the long-term 
(Mehran et al. 2012, Templeman et al. 2015), this is not 
always the case (Templeman et al. 2016). Both stimulated 
and basal insulin secretion are under multifactorial 
control and can be modulated through numerous means.
Although the carbohydrate glucose is clearly a 
dominant insulin secretagogue in adult beta-cells, 
evidence indicates that other sugars and non-carbohydrate 
substrates can also elicit significant insulin secretion 
under some conditions. For example, free fatty acids can 
acutely stimulate insulin secretion in some individuals, 
either alone or in the context of elevated glucose levels 
(Paolisso et al. 1995, Carpentier et al. 1999, Jeffrey et al. 
2008, Staaf et al. 2016). Prolonged exposure to high levels 
of lipids can also increase the number of beta-cells and 
induce fasting hyperinsulinemia in some rodent models 
(Fontes et al. 2010). Exposure to free fatty acids at very high 
concentrations, or for long periods of time, can eventually 
induce beta-cell death and dysfunction in human islets 
and in animal models (Jeffrey et al. 2008). Clearly, a better 
understanding of the effects of lipids on human beta-cells 
from a large array of donors is urgently needed.
Evidence similarly points to a role for some amino 
acids in acute and chronic insulin secretion (Nair & Short 
2005). For example, arginine is a well-known insulin 
secretagogue used to ‘maximally’ stimulate insulin 
secretion in a clinical setting (Robertson 2007). Elevated 
circulating levels of branched-chain amino acids are 
associated with over-nutrition, obesity and type 2 diabetes 
(McCormack et al. 2013). Metabolomic profiling of 2422 
Framingham Offspring individuals identified elevated 
levels of five branched-chain and aromatic amino acids 
(isoleucine, leucine, valine, tyrosine and phenylalanine) 
that were significantly associated with subsequent 
diabetes (Wang et al. 2011). Notably, branched-chain 
amino acids such as leucine can be powerful insulin 
secretagogues (van Loon et al. 2003). To date, no study 
has simultaneously compared the responsiveness to 
glucose, fatty acids and amino acids, but our anecdotal 
experience is that there is considerable variability in 
the relative responses to these macronutrient groups 
between individuals. Genetic profiling studies could 
be used to understand the mechanistic underpinnings 
of this variation. Answering this question could usher 
in a new era of nutrigenomics to minimize obesity and 
diabetes risk. If fats and proteins can stimulate robust 
insulin secretion in some individuals, it would mean that 
a one-size-fits-all prescription of simply avoiding excess 
carbohydrates would not be sufficient for these people. 
Maintaining insulin levels relatively in the healthy range 
might be more complex and individualized than once 
thought. It should be stressed that the healthy insulin 
range obviously has a minimum for each individual, 
below which diabetes occurs.
Conclusions and future directions
Long-term studies using ever more powerful animal 
models, as well as carefully defined human trials, 
are required to further test the hypothesis that 
hyperinsulinemia is a driving force in obesity, insulin

resistance and type 2 diabetes and to determine its net 
contribution, which is likely to be context dependent. 
Although our published studies have demonstrated 
that preventing hyperinsulinemia can prevent obesity 
in euglycemic conditions, we have not yet shown that 
obesity can be treated by reducing insulin secretion in 
mice that have already gained weight or demonstrated 
that hyperinsulinemia has a similar role in a more 
typical scenario that includes dysglycemia. Clinical 
evidence to support reducing insulin as a therapy 
for obesity has been presented (Lunetta et al. 1996, 
Alemzadeh et al. 1998, Lustig et al. 2005), but conflicting 
data on specific patient populations have also been 
published (Brauner et al. 2016). Therefore, a focus on 
hyperinsulinemia as a target for obesity has not yet 
been widely adopted. It is likely that hyperinsulinemia 
contributes to the ‘environmental’ part of the obesity 
risk equation, as common variation in the INS gene has 
not been genetically associated with BMI or circulating 
triglycerides 
(http://www.type2diabetesgenetics.org). 
 
Nevertheless, insulin could be reduced in many 
individuals by adopting low-carbohydrate diets, time-
controlled feeding or high-intensity exercise (Holloszy 
2005, Balkau et al. 2008, Hatori et al. 2012, Schugar 
& Crawford 2012, Nelson et al. 2013, Longo & Panda 
2016). Work in this area has the potential to change the 
paradigms of obesity and diabetes pathophysiology and 
to provide people with personalized nutritional advice 
for weight loss and disease prevention based around the 
maintenance of insulin within a healthy range. Lifestyle 
changes aimed at preventing excess circulating insulin 
could be a key to living a healthy long life.
