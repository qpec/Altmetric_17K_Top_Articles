K13 gene mutations are a primary marker of artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum
malaria that threatens the long-term clinical utility of artemisinin-based combination
therapies, the cornerstone of modern day malaria treatment. Here we describe a
multinational drug discovery programme that has delivered a synthetic tetraoxane-based
molecule, E209, which meets key requirements of the Medicines for Malaria Venture drug
candidate profiles. E209 has potent nanomolar inhibitory activity against multiple strains of
P. falciparum and P. vivax in vitro, is efficacious against P. falciparum in in vivo rodent models,
produces parasite reduction ratios equivalent to dihydroartemisinin and has pharmacokinetic
and pharmacodynamic characteristics compatible with a single-dose cure. In vitro studies
with transgenic parasites expressing variant forms of K13 show no cross-resistance with the
C580Y mutation, the primary variant observed in Southeast Asia. E209 is a superior next
generation endoperoxide with combined pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic features
that overcome the liabilities of artemisinin derivatives.

 T
he control and elimination of malaria requires effective
treatment strategies and the universal availability of
artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs)1,2. For
over a decade, research groups have sought to replace the semi-
synthetic artemisinin components (Fig. 1a, 1a–1c) of ACTs with a
fully synthetic alternative to reduce uncertainties regarding cost
and supply and to improve overall pharmacological qualities,
most notably short clinical half-lives. Several pharmacophores
have been explored3 including the tetraoxanes (Fig. 1b, 3a
and 3b).
Recent years, however, have witnessed the emergence of
parasite ‘resistance’ to artemisinin, first documented in western
Cambodia4,5. Malaria patients from this region were reported to
have a delayed parasite clearance following either artesunate
monotherapy or an ACT. The delayed parasite clearance
phenotype is not resistance as defined by the WHO6,7 and does
not necessarily lead to treatment failure8. However, it gives rise to
concerns of a reduction in the therapeutic lifespan of the most
effective, currently registered anti-malarials and the only class
that offers rapid parasite biomass reduction. Furthermore,
reduced artemisinin efficacy places greater selective pressure on
the ACT partner drugs, increasing the risk of multidrug resistance
to emerge. Indeed, recent results in Cambodia now document
increasing rates of clinical treatment failure in patients treated
with
the
first-line
combination
dihydroartemisinin
plus
piperaquine, because of the emergence of resistance to both
agents9
Here we describe the development of a fully synthetic
tetraoxane analogue, E209, which displays nanomolar efficacy
against multiple strains of P. falciparum and P. vivax with a
tailored combination of pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmaco-
kinetic (PK) properties compatible with a single-dose cure even
against a backdrop of the K13-dependent resistance mechanism
in operation in S.E. Asia8.
Results
Optimization of the tetraoxane series. The tetraoxane core 3a is
differentiated from 1,2,4-trioxolanes 2a and 1,2,4-trioxanes as it is
achiral, has greater inherent thermodynamic stability and potent
in vitro antimalarial activity, either as a simple unsubstituted
analogue, for example, 3a (Fig. 1) or related derivatives. Recent
theoretical calculations based on stereoelectronic analysis suggest
that the remarkable thermodynamic stability of tetraoxanes can
be attributed to a stereoelectronic ‘double anomeric effect’ which
stabilizes the six-membered ring system10.
Our initial medicinal chemistry focus was the preparation of
variants of a simplified analogue of our previous candidate RKA
182 with more balanced ADME properties (3b)11 (Supplementary
Figs 1, 2, 3 and 4). Multiple series were prepared to modulate
solubility, metabolic stability, pKa and log D (Supplementary
Fig. 4) but in all cases, the amide linked analogues, although
superior to the artemisinins, had relatively short half-lives and
poor antimalarial activity in the Plasmodium berghei mouse
model. We next prepared tetraoxane 4 as a direct comparator
(Supplementary Fig. 4; Supplementary Table 1) to OZ439
(ref. 12), which is currently in phase 2 clinical trials. Although
this analogue had equivalent in vitro potency to OZ439, it only
achieved a 16.3 day mean survival time (MSD) at a single
1 � 30 mg kg � 1 oral dose in P. berghei infected mice (Table 1).
This molecule was also slightly less stable in microsomal studies
in vitro with high clearance rates and a short half-life in rat PK
studies.
Cognisant of the liabilities of the artemisinin class, single-dose
survival time, intrinsic clearance and blood stability were used as
the key parameters to drive SAR studies towards lead series
progression (Supplementary Fig. 4; Supplementary Information).
Representative lead compounds are shown in Supplementary
Fig. 4 from which E209 and N205 were the clear front-runner
molecules with respect to cures in the P. berghei model and initial
DMPK assessments (Supplementary Table 1; Supplementary
Fig. 5) and were selected for further profiling. In vitro metabolic
stability assessments (Supplementary Table 2) and solubility
assessments (Supplementary Table 3) demonstrated the superior
properties of E209 and this compound was taken forward.
Following
scale
up
synthesis
(Supplementary
Note
2;
Supplementary Fig. 1), E209 was progressed to candidate
selection through a series of chemical, parasitological, pharma-
cological and toxicological checkpoints as outlined below.
PD properties of E209. E209 retained potent in vitro efficacy
(mean IC50 range 2.9–14.0 nM) against a panel of 10 sensitive and
multidrug-resistant P. falciparum parasite isolates from distinct
geographical origins, with no observable cross-resistance in
growth
inhibition
studies
(Supplementary
Table
4).
Supplementary Table 4 represents a panel of parasite isolates used
as part of a standard Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV)
in vitro evaluation and includes parasites that are universally
sensitive to current drugs (HB3) and parasites resistant to
chloroquine (as indicated), mefloquine (FCB, NF54), pyr-
imethamine and related DHFR inhibitors (K1, TMC90, V1/S and
so on) and atovaquone (TMC90). In the case of E209, activity
against all parasites is below the accepted cut off for resistance
and it is clear from visual inspection that there is no relationship
at all with chloroquine sensitivity. Cytotoxicity studies using
HeLa cells demonstrated that E209 had a high in vitro therapeutic
index of 200–1,000, with a median IC50 2.85 (s.d.±0.99 mM,
n ¼ 3) (c.f. dihydroartemisinin cytotoxicity (median IC50 0.4
(s.d.±0.1 mM, n ¼ 3)).
Ex vivo P. falciparum and P. vivax drug sensitivity experiments
were carried out in Papua Province in eastern Indonesia, an area
with documented multidrug-resistant P. falciparum and CQ-
resistant P. vivax, using a modified schizont maturation assay as
described previously13–17. Ethical approval for the ex vivo P.
falciparum and P. vivax efficacy data was obtained from the
Human Research Ethics Committee of the NT Department of
Health & Families and Menzies School of Health Research,
Darwin, Australia (HREC 2010-1396) and the Eijkman Institute
Research Ethics Commission, Jakarta, Indonesia (EIREC 47 and
EIREC 67). E209 exhibited equipotent ex vivo activity against
P. vivax (n ¼ 13; median IC50: 10.5 nM) and P. falciparum (n ¼ 3;
median
IC50:
15.7 nM)
clinical field isolates
from
Papua,
Indonesia (Mann–Whitney U test, P ¼ 0.570); Supplementary
Table 5. With the exception of chloroquine in P. falciparum
(Spearman rank correlation, P ¼ 0.042), there was no correlation
between the activity of E209 and any of the other anti-malarials
assessed in either species ((amodiaquine (AQ), piperaquine (PIP),
mefloquine
(MFQ)
and
artesunate
(AS)
(Supplementary
Table 6)).
E209 was screened for late stage gametocytocidal activity in a
standard membrane feeding assay (SMFA) and transmission-
blocking activity was determined in Anopheles stephensi mosqui-
toes. Late stage gametocytes were incubated with E209 for 24 h
prior to mosquito feeding and the IC50, (determined by the
reduction in oocyst mean intensity) was 14.5 nM with a
corresponding B60 and 90% transmission-blocking activity
(defined as the percentage of mosquitoes with no observed
oocysts)
recorded
at
100 nM
and
1 mM,
respectively
(Supplementary Fig. 6). The transmission reducing activity
(TRA) shown by E209 is consistent with that shown for the
endoperoxide class as reported in recent SMFA-based studies18,19.

 E209 (10 � IC50) displayed fast killing kinetics (Supplementary
Methods), with an in vitro parasite reduction ratio (log10PRR)
44.8 similar to artemisinin (log10PRR44.8), and faster than CQ
(log10PRR 4.5), pyrimethamine (log10PRR 3.7) and atovaquone
(log10PRR 2.9) (Fig. 2)20.
Critical for the development of E209 and related structures is
the evaluation of their activity against ART-resistant parasites,
which has been defined as delayed parasite clearance in patients5.
This phenotype has been associated clinically with a number of non-
synonymous SNPs in the propeller domain of the K13 protein,
located on chromosome 13 (ref. 23). Notably, these mutations could
not be associated with ART resistance using the standard in vitro
72h inhibitory assay, therefore a novel phenotypic assay was
developed to assess ART resistance in vitro. The ring-stage survival
assay (RSA0–3h) is based on the increased resistance of young ring-
stage parasites to a 6h pulse of 700nM dihydroartemisinin
(DHA)21,22. To investigate the impact of K13 mutations on E209
susceptibility, a series of gene-edited, otherwise isogenic parasite lines
with either K13 mutant or wild-type alleles have been subjected to
RSA0–3h assays using DHA as comparison23. This allowed us to
assess the potency of a pharmacological relevant dose of E209 against
K13 mutant parasites and to identify potential cross-resistance
phenotypes. In this study we focused on the most prevalent mutation
C580Y and R539T, which was demonstrated to confer high levels of
DHA resistance in vitro23(Fig. 3).Generally, we observe higher
survival rates after exposure of young ring stages to E209 in both
parasite backgrounds when compared to DHA. When subjected to a
700nM dose for 6h, we observe 4% survival of V1/S and 16% of
Cam3.II parasites for E209 compared to o1% survival when pulsed
with DHA. The highly prevalent K13 mutation C580Y does not
confer cross-resistance to E209. However, R539T shows a moderate
but significant increase of parasite survival in both parasites lines
tested. (Ring-stage survival assays, fold changes between K13 wild-
type and K13-mutant lines and IC50 data for DHA and E209 are
recorded in Supplementary Tables 15 and 16; Supplementary Fig. 7).
In vivo experiments using P. berghei infected mice demon-
strated that E209 when given orally resulted in complete parasite
clearance in the Peters’ standard 4-day suppressive test24, with an
estimated ED50 of 4 mg kg � 1 after three doses. Importantly, E209
also achieves 66% cure rate after a single oral dose of 30 mg kg � 1
(Table 1). Efficacy of E209 against the human malaria parasite
was tested in the immune-deficient NOD-SCID IL-2R_null
mouse engrafted with human erythrocytes and infected with
the P. falciparum strain 3D70087/N9 (ref. 25). Complete parasite
clearance was achievable with a single oral dose of E209
(30 mg kg � 1) with a calculated ED90 of 11.6 mg kg � 1 and an
AUC ED90 of 1.2 mg h ml � 1 (Fig. 4). This compares with an ED90
of 10 mg kg � 1 for artesunate following four consecutive daily
doses26. The maximum rate of parasite killing by E209 was
achieved with blood exposure between 5 and 10 mg h ml � 1

 (Fig. 4). Therefore, this range of exposure in human blood is
predicted to be the lowest necessary to achieve the maximum
parasite killing and can therefore be defined as the minimum
parasiticidal concentration (MPC).
In vitro and in vivo PKs of E209. E209 exhibited metabolic
degradation in human, rat and mouse liver microsomes with rates
generally being fastest in rat and slowest in the mouse
(Supplementary Table 17; Table 2). Comparing metabolite
profiles across all three species, hydroxylation(s) on the ada-
mantane ring to form multiple M þ 16 metabolites represent
important pathways in all three species. In addition, N-oxidation
to M þ 16 appears to be an important metabolic pathway in rat
whilst tetraoxane cleavage products were observed in all three
species (Supplementary Tables 17, 18, 19; Supplementary Fig. 8).
Compartmental PK modelling of preclinical in vivo data
showed a clear two compartmental trend for all three species.
Simulated PK profiles based on these compartmental model
predictions (Table 2) showed good agreement with observed data
as shown in Fig. 5a–c). Allometric scaling (see Methods) rat
PK data predicted a terminal half-life in humans of 24–30 h and
drug levels that exceed E209 IC50 levels for up to 6 days following
a single oral dose of 15 mg kg � 1 (Fig. 5d).
Preclinical safety studies. To assess potential for adverse activ-
ities, we profiled E209 using a diverse panel of radioligand
binding assays (CEREP screen), ion channel voltage clamp assays
and genotoxicity assays. In the CEREP screen, E209 at 10 mM
demonstrated a favourable profile apart from moderate potency
at Sigma 1 and Sigma 2 receptors (IC50s ca. 200 nM). Risk of
adverse cardiac activity including QT interval prolongation is
predicted to be low based on the measurement of a high IC50
(43.5 mM) in the hERG assay and no inhibitory activity at
4100 mM in Cav1.2 and Nav1.5 assays. E209 was negative in the
Ames test and mouse micronucleus test confirming the absence of
mutagenic potential.
We also examined the potential haemolytic effect of E209 in
NOD-SCID mice engrafted with the African variant G6PD
deficient human red blood cells (huRBC) as previously reported
for primaquine27. Mice treated with E209 at doses up to
50 mg kg � 1day � 1 for 3 days did not show a significant drug-
dependent loss of huRBC at 7 days post-treatment with all test
groups demonstrating a response similar to the vehicle control
(Supplementary Fig. 9A–C). In contrast primaquine, a drug that
causes haemolytic toxicity in humans with G6PD deficiency,
induced significant loss of huRBC (Supplementary Fig. 9A–C).
In addition, In vitro studies with cytochrome P450 (CYP)
isoforms demonstrated that E209 did not inhibit any of the major
human CYP450s with IC50s 420 mM (Supplementary Table 20).
The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) following a single oral
administration
of
E209

At 200 mg kg � 1day � 1 E209 was not tolerated in either sex.
At 100 mg kg � 1 there was body weight loss in females. On the
basis of weight loss and histopathology findings, the no observed
adverse effect level (NOAEL) for this study was 100 mg kg � 1
day � 1 for males and 50 mg kg � 1day � 1 for females. Systemic

(Supplementary Note 1), revealed the aryloxy template (Fig. 1) to
be the most promising in terms of multi-parameter lead-

we have been able to improve both the inherent pharmacody-

Figure 3 | Ring-stage survival assays show equal potency of E209 against K13 wild-type and C580Y mutant parasites whereas R539T confers a
marginal increase of survival. Results show the percentage of early ring-stage parasites (0–3 h post-invasion of human erythrocytes) that survived a 6-h
pulse of 700 nM DHA or E209, as measured by flow cytometry 90 hours later. Data show mean±s.e.m. percentage survival compared to DMSO-treated
parasites processed in parallel. Assays were performed on at least 2 separate occasions in duplicate. K13-propeller mutations R539T and C580Y confer
resistance to DHA in the clinical isolate Cam3.II and the reference line V1/S (a), (b). Exposure to E209 reveals generally higher survival with slight cross-
resistance observed in parasites carrying the R539T mutation (c), (d). A two-sample t-test with unequal variances was used to calculate P values. These
can be found in Supplementary Tables 7–14. *P valueo0.05, **P valueo0.001, ***P valueo0.0001.

determined as described by Sanz et al.20 Four independent serial dilutions were done with each sample to correct for experimental variation; error bars, s.d.
Previous results reported on standard anti-malarials tested at 10 � EC50 using the same conditions are shown for comparison.

 stability profiles in a range of species and rodent and human
blood stability) of the class.
In
addition
to
overall
high
potency,
our
studies
also
demonstrate that the fast PRR for E209 observed in in vitro
studies translates to a fast action in vivo in the humanized
SCID mouse model where a maximum parasite clearance was
achieved after a single dose of 30 mg kg � 1. To achieve this
level of parasite clearance with the clinical gold standard
endoperoxide artesunate requires four doses of artesunate
(50 mg kg � 1 day � 1) in the same model25. Initial safety and
pharmacology profiles for E209 meet the requirements of MMV’s
target candidate profile 1 (TCP1), a drug with a fast killing profile
(PRR equivalent to or better than dihydroartemisinin) and PK
qualities that would support a single-dose cure either singly or in
combination.
It is generally accepted that the mechanism of action of
endoperoxide
anti-malarials
involves
intra-parasitic
ferrous
mediated reductive scission of the endoperoxide bond. This
process leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species such as
carbon-centered radicals, which react with multiple parasite
proteins and result in parasite killing28–30. Because of this
proposed mechanism of action it was originally argued that
malaria parasites would find it difficult to acquire resistance to
this drug class. However, compelling clinical data from Southeast
Asia has confirmed that resistance has emerged and established
itself in the region. The resistance phenotype has been difficult to
study, as it does not show up as a shift in potency (IC50 value) in
traditional
drug
sensitivity
assays20.
Extensive
molecular
investigations have implicated mutations in the K13 gene as key
to this unusual resistance phenotype. These mutations allow the
parasite to survive exposure to drug at the early ring stage of red
blood
cell
infection
even
at
supra-pharmacological
drug
concentrations20,21. A concern is that this type of resistance
mechanism would blight the long-term clinical utility of the
entire
endoperoxide
class
of
antimalarial
drugs.
Our
interpretation of this resistance mechanism, which is supported
by recent modelling studies28, is that the slow parasite clearance
phenotype seen clinically is a result of the loss of drug
susceptibility in ring-stage parasites coupled with the extremely
short elimination half-life of the endoperoxide. A potential
solution to this problem is to extend the current 3-day
artemisinin treatment course to four days as suggested by

 Dogovski et al.31 We believe that E209 provides a more elegant
solution since it circumvents or minimizes the ring-stage
resistance seen with currently deployed endoperoxides with a
predicted elimination half-life of 24–30 h compared to current
artemisinins that have half-lives of circa 1–2 h (ref. 32). Hence,
not only will E209 plasma levels remain above the IC50 level for 4
days or more in malaria patients as required by MMV’s TCP1
criteria (based on PK predictions, Supplementary Methods),
but
it
will
also
retain
killing
potential
throughout
each
individual stage of parasite’s 48 h intra-erythrocytic cycle. Thus,
E209 has the potential for deployment in a superior combination
treatment with a partner drug devoid of existing in vivo
resistance
liabilities (such
as
the
ATP4
inhibitors33,34
or
DHODH inhibitors35). E209 has the potential to offer a
substantial improvement on currently deployed artemisinin-
based drug combinations and provide an urgently required
alternative TCP1 drug for malaria treatment and elimination
programmes.
Methods
Synthesis of E209. Details of the synthesis and analytical data on E209 are
included in Supplementary Note 2.
Parasite culture and drug sensitivity testing. P. falciparum blood stage cultures
were maintained by the method of Trager and Jensen36. Drug sensitivity during
E209 development and QSAR was determined by the method of Winter et al.37
Drug sensitivity of E209 against panel of P. falciparum strains was determined
based on hypoxanthine incorporation38,39. Mammalian cell cytotoxicity assays
were carried out as previously described40.
A zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN)-based gene editing approach was employed to
specifically introduce or remove K13 mutations from P. falciparum lines. Parasites
were electroporated with a plasmid containing ZFNs specifically engineered against
K13. The nucleases were expressed from an episomally maintained plasmid by
selecting with 2.5 nM (Cam3.II) or 10 nM (V1/S) WR99210 for 6 days. A 1.5 kb
K13 donor fragment harbouring the desired mutation was placed on the same
plasmid and served as template for the double strand break repair. Parasite clones
were generated by limiting dilution. A detailed protocol can be found in Straimer
et al.21
Ring-stage survival assays (RSA0–3 h) were carried out as previously described
with minor modifications21,23. In summary, 10–15 ml parasite cultures were
synchronized 1–2 times using 5% sorbitol (Sigma-Aldrich). Synchronous
multinucleated schizonts were incubated in RPMI-1640 containing 15 units/ml
sodium heparin for 15 min at 37 �C to disrupt agglutinated erythrocytes (purchased
from Interstate Blood Bank located in Memphis, TN, USA), concentrated over a
gradient of 75% Percoll (Sigma-Aldrich), washed once in RPMI-1640 and
incubated for 3 h with fresh erythrocytes to allow time for merozoite invasion.
Cultures were then subjected again to sorbitol treatment to eliminate remaining
schizonts. The 0–3 h post-invasion rings were adjusted to 1% parasitemia and
2% haematocrit in 1 ml volumes (in 48-well plates), and exposed to 700 nM DHA,
TDD-E209, JC3-39 or 0.1% DMSO (solvent control) for 6 h. Duplicate wells were
established for each parasite line±drug. The supernatant was then removed, the
culture resuspended in 1 ml culture media and transferred to 15 ml conical tubes,
centrifuged at 800g for 3 min to pellet the cells and the supernatants carefully
removed. As a washing step to remove drug, 10 ml culture medium were added to
each tube and the cells resuspended, centrifuged and the medium aspirated. This
washing procedure was repeated three times and included a transfer into a new
15 ml conical tube after the second washing step. Fresh medium lacking drug was
then added to cultures, which were returned to standard culture conditions for
90 h. Parasite viability was assessed by microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained
thin blood smears. Second-generation ring stages are clearly visible under the
microscope but only give a faint signal when measured by flow cytometry.
Therefore, we performed a media change 66 h after the drug incubation and
allowed the culture to develop for another 24 h into second-generation trophozoite
stages. Parasite survival was determined by staining parasites with 2 � SYBR Green
I and 165 nM MitoTracker Deep Red (Invitrogen) and a minimum of 8,000 cells
were counted by flow cytometry on an Accuri C6 cytometer. Percentage survival
was calculated as the parasitemia in the drug-treated sample divided by the
parasitemia in the untreated sample � 100.
P. cynomolgi M strain (a non-human primate malaria closely related to the
human malaria P. vivax and forming dormant liver stages) was used for in vitro
liver stage drug assays (The M strain BPRC was obtained from Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC, USA). Liver stage drug assays were performed in
primary rhesus monkey hepatocytes as described41. Read out of the assay was
performed using a high-content imaging system (Operetta) and analysed with
Harmony software. As described previously42 two populations of liver stage
parasite can be discriminated in 6-day-old cultures: large forms define liver

 schizonts and persistent small forms are dormant liver stages (hypnozoites).
Small forms are defined as having a maximum parasite area of 30 mm2.
Ex vivo P. falciparum and P. vivax drug sensitivity experiments were carried out
in Papua Indonesia, an area with documented multidrug-resistant P. falciparum
and CQ-resistant P. vivax., using a modified schizont maturation assay as described
previously13–17. In brief, 200 ml of a 2% haematocrit blood media mixture (BMM),
consisting of RPMI-1640 medium plus 10% AB þ human serum (P. falciparum) or
McCoy’s 5A medium plus 20% AB þ human serum (P. vivax) was added to each
well of pre-dosed drug plates containing 11 serial concentrations (2-fold dilutions)
of the anti-malarials being tested. A candle jar was used to mature the parasites at
37�C for 35–56 h. Incubation was stopped when 440% of ring-stage parasites had
reached mature schizont stage in the drug-free control wells. Thick blood films
made from each well were stained with 5% Giemsa solution for 30 min and
examined microscopically. The number of schizonts per 200 asexual stage parasites
was determined for each drug concentration and normalized to the control well.
The dose-response data were analysed using nonlinear regression analysis
(WinNonLn 4.1, Pharsight) and the IC50 value derived using an inhibitory sigmoid
Emax model.
Ethical approval for the ex vivo P. falciparum and P. vivax efficacy data was
obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee of the NT Department of
Health & Families and Menzies School of Health Research, Darwin, Australia
(HREC 2010-1396) and the Eijkman Institute Research Ethics Commission,
Jakarta, Indonesia (EIREC 47 and EIREC 67). Written informed consent was
obtained from all patients participating in the study.
The SMFA study was conducted as previously described where mature
gametocytes were incubated for 24 h with different concentrations of E209 prior to
performing mosquito feeds43–45. The RSA0–3 h was performed as described in
Witkowski et al.,21 whereby tightly synchronized early ring-stage parasites were
exposed to a drug pulse for 6 h at 700 nM. After drug removal (by washing) the
parasites were returned to culture. Parasitemias were then assessed 66 h later on
thin blood smears by two independent microscopists and the percentage survival
was assessed in comparison to parasites not exposed to drug, as described by
Straimer et al.23 Assays were performed in duplicate on three separate occasions.
Parasite reduction ratios were conducted as described in Supplementary
Methods20.
In vivo efficacy. Studies of murine P. falciparum infection were ethically reviewed
and carried out in accordance with European Directive 2010/63/EU and the GSK
Policy on the Care, Welfare and Treatment of Laboratory Animals. In vivo efficacy
against P. falciparum was conducted25 in age-matched female immunodeficient
NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ mice (8–10 weeks of age; 22–24 g) supplied by
Charles River, UK, under licence of The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor. Mice
were engrafted with human erythrocytes (Red Cross Transfusion Blood Bank in
Madrid, Spain) by daily intraperitoneal injection with 1 ml of a 50% haematocrit
erythrocyte suspension (RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen), 25 mM HEPES (Sigma), 25%
decomplemented AB þ human serum (Sigma) and 3.1 mM hypoxanthine
(Sigma)). Mice with B40% circulating human erythrocytes were intravenously
infected with 2 � 107 P. falciparum Pf3D70087/N9-infected erythrocytes (day 0).
Efficacy was assessed by administering one oral dose of E209 (2.5, 5, 15, 30, 50 and
100 mg kg � 1) at day 3 after infection. Treatment group assignments were allocated
randomly. Parasitemia was measured by flow cytometry in samples of peripheral
blood stained with the fluorescent nucleic acid dye SYTO-16 (Molecular Probes)
and anti-murine erythrocyte TER119 monoclonal antibody (Becton Dickinson)
in serial 2 ml blood samples taken every 24 h until assay completion. The ED90
was estimated by fitting a four parameter logistic equation using GraphPad 6.0
Software.
Systemic exposure measurement in infected Pf SCID mice. The levels of E209
were evaluated in whole blood to determine standard PK parameters in the
individual animals used in the efficacy study. Peripheral blood samples (5 mg ml � 1)
were taken at different times (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 23 h) after drug admin-
istration, mixed with 25 ml of Milli-Q water and immediately frozen on dry ice. The
frozen samples were stored at � 80 �C until analysis. Vehicle-treated mice
experienced the same blood-sampling regimen. Blood samples were processed by
liquid–liquid extraction. Quantitative analysis by Liquid chromatography-tandem
mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) was performed using a Waters UPLC system and
Sciex API4000 mass spectrometer. The lower limit of quantification in this
assay was 5 ng ml � 1. Blood concentration versus time was analysed by non-
compartmental analysis (NCA) using Phoenix ver.6.3 (from Pharsight), from
which exposure-related values (Cmax and AUC0–23, AUC0–t) and tmax were
estimated.
In vitro and in vivo PK studies. Details of the in vitro PK analysis of E209 are
contained in Supplementary Tables 1, 2, 3, 17, 19 and 19). In vitro metabolic
stability of E209 was carried out as described in Supplementary Methods.
In vivo PK studies in rats and mice were conducted using established
procedures in accordance with the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and
Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes, and the study protocols were reviewed and
approved by the Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences Animal Ethics
Committee.
Rat PK studies were conducted in fasted 7–9-week-old male Sprague–Dawley
rats, as previously described by Charman et al.12 For intravenous administration
E209 was dissolved in 5% glucose solution under sonication (for 10 min) prior to
addition of Tween 80 and further sonication (5 min) to produce a clear solution.
The formulation was filtered through a 0.22 mm syringe filter prior to dosing and
aliquots retained to determine the dose administered. E209 was administered
intravenously as a 10 min constant rate infusion via an indwelling jugular vein
cannula (1 ml per rat, n ¼ 2 rats).
For oral dosing, E209 was dissolved in 0.5% [w/v] hydroxypropyl
methylcellulose containing 0.4% [w/v] Tween 80 and 0.5% [v/v] benzyl alcohol and
sonicated for 5 min producing a clear solution. The bulk formulation was mixed by
inverting the tubes prior to drawing each dosing volume. Aliquots of the dosing
solution were retained for analysis to determine the dose administered. After the
oral formulation (1 ml per rat, n ¼ 2 rats) was administered, an additional volume
(1 ml) of Milli-Q water was administered (via a separate syringe).
Blood samples were collected using a Culex automated blood sampler over 48 h
post-dosing into tubes containing anticoagulant and stabilization cocktail
(Complete, potassium fluoride and EDTA) to minimize the potential for ex vivo
degradation and immediately centrifuged at 4 �C. Plasma was separated, stored at
� 20 �C until processing and assayed by LC/MS using either a Waters Micromass
Quattro Ultima PT triple quadrupole instrument coupled to a Waters 2795 HPLC
or a Waters Micromass Quattro Premier triple quadrupole instrument coupled to a
Waters Acquity UPLC.
The PKs of E209 was also studied in non-fasted 6-8 week old female Swiss
Outbred mice that had access to food and water ad libitum throughout the pre- and
post-dose sampling period. The formulations for intravenous and oral
administration were the same as used for the rat studies (study protocols were
reviewed and approved by the Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences Animal
Ethics Committee).
E209 was administered intravenously by bolus tail vein injection (50 ml per
mouse) or orally by gavage (10 ml kg � 1) and blood samples collected over 30 h
post-dosing (n ¼ 2 mice per time point). A maximum of two samples were
obtained from each mouse, with samples being taken either via submandibular
bleed (conscious sampling) or terminal cardiac puncture (underinhaled isofluorane
anaesthesia). Blood was collected into tubes in the same way as described for the rat
studies and immediately centrifuged and stored at � 20 �C until analysis by
LC–MS.
Plasma PK parameters were calculated based on compartmental PK analysis
using Pmetrics46 as described in Supplementary Methods. A classical three
compartment oral absorption model was used for all tested species due to the
tri-phasic profiles displayed over time. For human predictions, allometric scaling
was performed based on weight. Clearance rates (including inter-compartmental
clearance rates Q1 and Q2) were predicted according to the following equations:
CLhuman ¼ CLanimal� Humanweight

Other PK parameters were scaled linearly and simulation of human exposure to
TDD-E209 was performed assuming a 15 mg kg � 1 dose using Pmetrics where
median values were plotted over time on a semi-log scale.
hERG profiling and assessment of cytotoxicity. The potencies (IC50 values) for
E209 to inhibit the cardiac IKr (hERG), Cav1.2 and Nav1.5 channels were deter-
mined in an electrophysiology-based assays using IonWorks HT (CHO cells)27.
In vivo (rat) safety studies. A single, rising oral dose study to determine the
MTD of E209 and aid in the selection of dose levels for the 7-day toxicity study.
The rats (Sprague–Dawley, age 6–7 weeks) were divided into four groups, each
with three male and three female. Dose levels employed were 30, 100, 300 and
1,000 mg kg � 1 and the MTD was shown to be 300 mg kg � 1.
Following this single dose MTD study, rats were dosed once a day at 0, 30, 100
and 300 mg kg � 1 po E209 for 7 days. E209 was formulated in 0.5 % [w/v] HPMC,
0.4% Tween 80 [w/v], 0.5% [v/v] benzyl alcohol in purified water. In each group
there were eight Sprague–Dawley rats of each sex. At the end of the dosing period,
five rats/sex/group were killed (day 8) and the remaining three rats/sex/group were
left for recovery. In addition, six rats of each sex per group were allocated for
toxicokinetics.
In vivo PK studies conformed to AAALAC International and NIH guidelines as
reported in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, National
Research Council (2011); People’s Republic of China, Ministry of Science &
Technology, ‘Regulations for the Administration of Affairs Concerning
Experimental Animals’, 1988.
