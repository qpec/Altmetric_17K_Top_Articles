The changes in brain function that perpetuate opiate addiction are unclear. In our studies of human narcolepsy, a 
disease caused by loss of immunohistochemically detected hypocretin (orexin) neurons, we encountered a control 
brain (from an apparently neurologically normal individual) with 50% more hypocretin neurons than other control 
human brains that we had studied. We discovered that this individual was a heroin addict. Studying five postmortem 
brains from heroin addicts, we report that the brain tissue had, on average, 54% more immunohistochemically 
detected neurons producing hypocretin than did control brains from neurologically normal subjects. Similar 
increases in hypocretin-producing cells could be induced in wild-type mice by long-term (but not short-term) 
administration of morphine. The increased number of detected hypocretin neurons was not due to neurogenesis and 
outlasted morphine administration by several weeks. The number of neurons containing melanin-concentrating 
hormone, which are in the same hypothalamic region as hypocretin-producing cells, did not change in response 
to morphine administration. Morphine administration restored the population of detected hypocretin cells to 
normal numbers in transgenic mice in which these neurons had been partially depleted. Morphine administration 
also decreased cataplexy in  mice made narcoleptic by the depletion of hypocretin neurons. These findings sug-
gest that opiate agonists may have a role in the treatment of narcolepsy, a disorder caused by hypocretin neuron 
loss, and that increased numbers of hypocretin-producing cells may play a role in maintaining opiate addiction.
INTRODUCTION
The annual rate of opiate overdose deaths in the United States has 
increased fourfold in the last 17 years, with more than 300,000 
deaths since 2000. Addicts are unable to overcome opiate addiction, 
even as they realize the destructive effect it is having on them and 
their families (1). Prior work suggests that hypocretin cell activity is 
linked to pleasure-mediated arousal and, hence, may play a role in 
perpetuating addiction (2–4).
Previously, we reported that human narcolepsy is linked to, on 
average, a 90% loss of immunohistochemically identified hypocretin- 
producing cells (5). More recently, we reported a decreased number 
of immunohistochemically identified hypocretin neurons in Parkin-
son’s disease (6, 7). In analyzing postmortem brain tissue from neuro-
logically normal control individuals, we unexpectedly encountered 
a brain with 50% more hypocretin-producing neurons than we had 
found in any of the other control human brain tissues we had studied. 
Further investigation revealed that this individual was a former 
heroin addict.
Here, we acquired postmortem brain tissue from four additional hu-
man heroin addicts. We saw a greatly elevated number of hypocretin- 
producing cells in the brain of each addict. We then explored whether 
administering morphine to wild-type mice would produce a similar 
increase in hypocretin-producing cells, what the effects of the dose 
and schedule of administration effects were on the magnitude of the 
increase, and how long the changes in hypocretin neuron number 
and cell size persisted after the cessation of administration. We then 
exploited the finding of an increase in hypocretin cells induced by 
opiate administration in mice to see whether morphine might have 
beneficial effects in a mouse model of narcolepsy where hypocretin 
cell number had been reduced to mimic the low number of hypocretin 
cells found in human narcolepsy.
RESULTS
An increased number of immunohistochemically positive 
hypocretin (orexin) neurons in the brains of human  
heroin addicts
There was an average increase of 54% in the number of detectable 
hypocretin-producing neurons in the postmortem brain tissue from 
five human heroin addicts relative to matched control brains [P = 
0.0009, t = 8.89, df = 10 (t test); Table 1 and Fig. 1A]. The range of 
increase in the addicts was 36 to 74% above mean control values. 
Hypocretin-producing cells were found to be 22% smaller in the 
brains of addicts compared to controls [P < 0.01, t = 2.78, df = 10 
(t test); Fig. 1, B and D]. About 90% of hypocretin-producing neurons

in the brains of human control subjects also contained Narp (neu-
ronal activity–regulated pentraxin), a secreted neuronal pentraxin 
that co-localizes with hypocretin in hypothalamic neurons (8). This 
percentage was similar in the larger number of hypocretin neurons 
observed in human heroin addicts (Fig. 1E).
Dose-dependent effects of morphine administration on 
hypocretin-producing cells in the brains of wild-type mice
To determine whether the differences in the number and size of 
hypocretin-producing neuron somas seen between human heroin 
addicts and controls might be induced by opiates, we administered 
morphine to mice at several doses for varying time periods. Subcu-
taneous injection of fixed and escalating doses of morphine for 
7 days did not significantly change the number of hypocretin cells 
detected in the mouse brain. However, 14-day administration of 
either dose schedule increased hypocretin cell number relative 
to saline injection [P = 0.01, t = 4.23, df = 4 and P = 0.01, t = 4.52, 
df = 4 (t tests), respectively; Fig. 2A]. Fixed morphine doses of 
10 mg/kg or greater for a single 2-week period increased hypocretin 
cell number [F7,16 = 8.1, P < 0.001, analysis of variance (ANOVA)] with 
a maximal average increase of 38% at the 50 mg/kg dose (Fig. 2B). 
With daily dosing for a 60-day period, the magnitude of changes in 
hypocretin cell number was smaller than that after 14 days of mor-
phine administration (F3,12 = 13.5, P < 0.001, ANOVA, normality, 
variance tests passed between groups; Fig. 2C). The effect on hypo-
cretin cell number was largest in the lateral hypothalamus (LH), but 
an increase in hypocretin cell number was also seen in the medial 
hypothalamus (MH) [LH: P = 0.001, t = 11.94, df = 7; MH: P = 0.05, 
t = 2.44, df = 7 (t tests); Fig. 2D]. After 14 days of administration of 
morphine (50 mg/kg), hypocretin cell number remained elevated 
for an additional 4 to 8 weeks [P = 0.001, t = 6.13, df = 8 (t test, 
ANOVA, normality, variance tests passed between groups), F5,22 = 
9.4, P < 0.001; Fig. 2E]. After 60 days of administration of the same 
morphine dose (bottom), the elevation of hypocretin cell number 
persisted for an additional 2 weeks after the end of drug administration 
[F5,22 = 6.3, P < 0.001 (ANOVA, normality, variance tests passed 
between groups); Fig. 2E]. Figure 2F shows the time course of 
recovery from hypocretin cell shrinkage after daily administration 
of morphine (50 mg/kg) or saline to five experimental and five con-
trol mice for 2 weeks. Hypocretin cell size increased toward control 
values over the 4-week period after cessation of morphine adminis-
tration [F5,58 = 5.3, P < 0.0005 (ANOVA); Fig. 2F]. The increased 
number of hypocretin- 
producing cells was within the regions con-
taining hypocretin cells under baseline conditions [P = 0.001, t = 
4.88, df = 10; Fig. 2G]. There was no change in the percentage of 
Narp-containing cells within the increased number of hypocretin- 
producing cells in mice treated with morphine (50 mg/kg) for 14 days 
(Fig. 2H).
Because subcutaneous implantation of morphine pellets is com-
monly used in opiate research, we studied the effect of implantation 
of morphine pellets (25 mg) or control pellets in 14 mice. Figure 2I 
shows the effects of subcutaneously administered morphine pellets 
compared to control pellets on the distribution of hypocretin cell 
size 72 hours after implantation. On average, cell size was decreased 
by 23% in response to morphine pellet implantation [U = 5239, P < 
0.01 (Mann-Whitney U test); Fig. 2I]. Thus, as with morphine injec-
tion, morphine pellet implantation resulted in a reduction in hypo-
cretin cell size, shifting the entire population distribution downward. 
However, the continuous presence of morphine for 7 or 14 days, 
produced by replacing pellets every 3 days, did not produce a signifi-
cant increase in hypocretin cell number (Fig. 2J). The number of 
melanin- 
concentrating hormone (MCH)–producing cells in the brains 
of mice was not affected by injection of morphine at 50 or 100 mg/kg 
for 14 days (Fig. 2K). There was no change in MCH cell size after 
14 days of morphine administration to the mice (Fig. 2L).
Changes in preprohypocretin, Narp, preprodynorphin,  
and MCH in response to morphine
An escalating dose of morphine (100 mg/kg; Fig. 3, A to C) was 
given to wild-type mice for 14 days. Quantitative polymerase chain 
Fig. 1. Postmortem brain tissue from heroin addicts shows an increased number of hypocretin-producing neurons. Subject characteristics are presented in Table 1. 
(A) Immunohistochemistry showed that there was a 54% increase in the number of detectable hypocretin neurons in hypothalamic brain tissue from human heroin ad-
dicts (n = 5) relative to hypothalamic tissue from human control subjects [n = 7; P = 0.0009, t = 8.89, df = 10 (t test)]. (B) Immunohistochemical staining of postmortem brain 
tissue showed that hypocretin cells were 22% smaller in brain tissue from heroin addicts compared to control subjects [P < 0.01, t = 2.78, df = 10 (t test)]. (C) Neurolucida

Fig. 2. Dose-dependent effects of morphine administration on hypocretin cells in mouse brain. We administered morphine (blue) or saline (green) to wild-type lit-
termate mice and then stained brain tissue for hypocretin-producing cells. (A) A fixed morphine dose (FD) of 100 mg/kg for 7 days, or an escalating morphine dose (ED) 
starting at 100 mg/kg for 3 days and increasing by 20% every third day for 7 days, did not significantly increase hypocretin cell number. However, a fixed dose of morphine 
(100 mg/kg) for 14 days and an escalating dose for 14 days (with a final dose of 180 mg/kg) both increased hypocretin cell number [P = 0.01, t = 4.23, df = 4 and +22%, 
P = 0.01, t = 4.52, df = 4 (t test), respectively). (B) Morphine doses of 10 mg/kg or higher all produced a significantly elevated number of hypocretin neurons compared to 
saline- 
injected mice. The elevation in hypocretin cell number at 50 mg/kg was 38%. Doses above 50 mg/kg produced no further increase [F7,16 = 8.1, P < 0.001 (ANOVA)]. 
(C) Shown are the effects of long-term (60 days) daily administration of morphine at doses of 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg. All three doses produced significant increases in hypo-
cretin cell number as a percentage of control, with the largest increase (+26%) observed at a dose of 25 mg/kg [F3,12 = 13.5, P < 0.001 (ANOVA)]. (D) Shown is the medio-
lateral distribution of increased hypocretin cell number after 14 days of morphine administration at 50 mg/kg in wild-type mice. The elevation of hypocretin cell 
number was largest in the LH, but the effect was also significant in the MH [LH: P = 0.001, t = 11.94, df = 7; MH: P = 0.05, t = 2.44, df = 7 (t test)]. PFA, perifornical area. 
(E) Graph shows the persistence of the elevation of the number of hypocretin neurons after the termination of morphine administration to wild-type mice compared to 
mice injected with saline (control). Shown is the duration of hypocretin’s effects after termination of daily morphine (50 mg/kg) administration starting with the day after 
the final injection (day 0 of withdrawal) relative to control. After 14 days of morphine administration (top), hypocretin cell number remained significantly elevated for 
4 weeks [F5,22 = 9.4, P < 0.001 (ANOVA)]. After 60 days of morphine administration (bottom), the significant elevation of hypocretin cell number lasted for 2 weeks [F5,22 = 
6.3, P < 0.001 (ANOVA)]. (F) A 12.8 ± 2.8% decrease in hypocretin cell size was observed after administration of morphine (50 mg/kg) for 14 days to wild-type mice 
[significant interaction of treatment and withdrawal (F5,58 = 5.3, P < 0.0005)]. After 4 weeks of morphine withdrawal, hypocretin cell size returned to the size seen in 
saline-treated animals. (G) Representative neurolucida plots and photomicrographs illustrate the increased number and the reduced size of hypocretin cells after 2 weeks 
of morphine administration at 50 mg/kg fixed dose. Numbers indicate cell counts in section. Scale bars, 150 m (neurolucida plots) and 50 m (photomicrographs). 3V, 
third ventricle. (H) No change was observed in the percentage of cells double-labeled for both hypocretin and Narp in wild-type mice treated with morphine (50 mg/kg) 
for 14 days compared to control mice injected with saline. (I) We measured the effect of morphine pellet implantation on hypocretin cell number and size compared to 
control pellets in wild-type mice 72 hours after implantation. On average, cell size was decreased by 23% [P = 0.001 (Mann-Whitney U test), U = 5239]. n = 128 cells for 
control saline-injected mouse brain (green), and n = 149 cells for morphine-injected mouse brain (blue). (J) Shown are the effects of replacement of depleted morphine 
or control pellets at 3-day intervals for up to 7 or 14 days to mimic continuous opiate administration. (K and L) In contrast to hypocretin, MCH cell number and size were 
not affected by administration of morphine at 50 or 100 mg/kg for 14 days to wild-type mice. Dark green color in (K) and (L) distinguishes MCH neuron comparisons with 
saline control from hypocretin neuron comparisons with saline control. There was no change in MCH cell size compared to saline control. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P <

reaction (qPCR) was performed to measure mRNA amounts in 
mouse brains of preprohypocretin, Narp, and preprodynorphin 
(Fig. 3, A to C). Western blotting was used to assess the quantity of 
preprohypocretin and MCH peptide in mouse brain (Fig. 3, D and E, 
and fig. S1). The amounts of mRNAs encoding preprohypocretin, 
Narp, and preprodynorphin, all found in hypocretin-positive 
neurons, were found to be elevated [preprohypocretin: P = 0.03, 
t = 2.99, df = 5; Narp: P = 0.02, t = 3.36, df = 5 (t test); preprody-
norphin: P = 0.01, t = 3.65, df = 5 (t test); Fig. 3, A to C]. Western 
blot quantitation showed that a 14-day administration of morphine 
to wild-type mice increased preprohypocretin by 79% [P = 0.05, 
t = 2.51, df = 6 in each group (t test)], which returned to baseline 
within 2 weeks of drug withdrawal (Fig. 3D). Figure 3E shows that 
there was no significant change in MCH in the same animals.
Morphine-induced changes in hypocretin cell number are 
not due to neurogenesis
Morphine administration at 100 mg/kg for 14 days to wild-type 
mice increased the number of hypocretin-producing cells in 
mouse brains (Fig. 2). However, morphine administration to 
knockout mice (9) that cannot produce hypocretin did not result 
in immunohistochemical detection of hypocretin, indicating that 
the observed immunolabeling after morphine required the pres-
ence of hypocretin (Fig. 4A). There was no significant change 
in the number of 5-bromo- 
2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU)–labeled cells 
throughout the hypocretin neuron region after morphine admin-
istration to wild-type mice, indicating that the increased number 
of hypocretin neurons in response to morphine was not due to 
neurogenesis (Fig. 4B). Fourteen days of morphine (100 mg/kg) 
treatment also did not produce any change in doublecortin stain-
ing of neurons in the hypothalamus of mouse brains compared to 
saline treatment (Fig. 4C, left). Doublecortin staining validity 
was indicated by a normal labeling pattern in the dentate gyrus 
(Fig. 4C, right).
Effect of systemic morphine injections on the activity of 
hypocretin neurons in rats in vivo
A species-appropriate dose of morphine (15 mg/kg) resulted in an 
elevated action potential discharge rate in rat brain hypocretin neu-
rons, accompanied by increased electroencephalographic (EEG) 
activation and increased electromyographic (EMG) activity in the 
freely moving rats (Fig. 5). Hypocretin neurons were identified using 
our previously published criteria (10). Figure 5A shows the discharge 
rate in rat hypocretin neurons during active waking, quiet waking, 
non–rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and REM sleep and after 
morphine injection in waking animals (averaged across five neu-
rons recorded in three rats). Hypocretin neurons displayed an ele-
vated discharge rate after morphine administration comparable to 
that during active waking and greater than that during quiet waking, 
non-REM sleep, and REM sleep [one-way ANOVA for hypocretin 
neurons: n = 5, F4,16 = 18.2, P < 0.0001; post hoc comparisons with 
Tukey/Kramer procedure: active and quiet waking, P < 0.05; active 
waking and non-REM/REM sleep, P < 0.01; morphine administration: 
active waking, quiet waking, non-REM sleep, and REM sleep, all 
P < 0.01]. Figure 5B shows recordings of the discharge rate in dis-
charges per second, muscle tone, and EEG data (expansions enable 
better visualization of the time course and an action potential wave-
form, used to aid in identification of hypocretin neurons; recording 
sites are indicated in Fig. 5C by black arrowheads).
Reversal of decreased hypocretin cell number in narcoleptic 
mice after morphine administration
We used a newly developed transgenic mouse model in which hypo-
cretin cell loss is triggered by doxycycline (DOX) withdrawal, the 
orexin-tTA; TetO diphtheria toxin A (DTA) mice (henceforth called 
DTA mice) (11). This transgenic mouse model allows induction of 
selective hypocretin cell loss and symptoms of narcolepsy with 
cataplexy in adult DTA mice after DOX withdrawal, resembling 
the syndrome that occurs in human narcolepsy. Resuming DOX

Fig. 3. Effect of morphine administration on preprohypocretin, preprodynorphin, Narp, and MCH expression in mouse brain. An escalating dose of morphine, 
starting at 100 mg/kg, was given for 14 days to wild-type mice. qPCR was performed to measure mRNA expression (A to C), and Western blotting was used to assess the

administration stops further hypocretin cell loss in the DTA mice. 
Control mice were DTA mouse littermates maintained on DOX 
throughout the experiment. The dashed horizontal red line in 
Fig. 6A shows the number of hypocretin cells in DTA littermate 
control mice maintained on DOX and administered daily saline 
injections for 14 days. The green bar shows littermate DTA mice 
subjected to DOX withdrawal for 1.5 days, followed by restoration 
of DOX administration and saline injections for 14 days. A 30% 
reduction in hypocretin cells relative to the number of hypocretin 
cells in control DTA mice maintained on DOX was observed 
(Fig. 6A). However, when daily morphine (100 mg/kg) injections 
were given instead of saline injections for 14 days in the experi-
mental group, the number of hypocretin cells detected by immuno-
histochemistry was restored to baseline [blue bar; P = 0.0003, t = 6.31, 
df = 4 (t test)]. Figure 6B shows the effect of morphine administration 
on cataplexy in two groups of four hypocretin cell–depleted DTA 
mice. DOX treatment was halted for 18 days, a duration that pro-
duces a 95% depletion of hypocretin neurons and cataplexy. Mor-
phine treatment given at a dose of 50 mg/kg for 1 or 2 weeks 
reduced cataplexy relative to control untreated mice [treatment effect, 
F1,6 = 148.4, P = 0.0001 (ANOVA)]. Hypocretin knockout mice, in 
which the hypocretin neurons are present but the peptide is absent 
from birth, show much lower amounts of cataplexy than do DTA 
mice. Therefore, the effects of morphine administration on hypo-
cretin knockout mice could not easily be tested. The extensive loss 
of most of the hypocretin cell bodies in the DTA mice more closely 
resembles the characteristics of human narcolepsy than does the 
lack of hypocretin neuron production in hypocretin knockout mice.
Figure 6C shows the number of hypocretin-producing cells in 
three human control subjects without narcolepsy (green) and in 
two patients with narcolepsy. In contrast to our prior studies of 40-m 
sections of frozen human brain tissue analyzed by stereology (5), 
brain tissue of all five subjects was preserved in paraffin, was sec-
tioned at 6-m intervals, and was counted with an automated 
counting procedure. Both patient NBB-01064 and patient NBB-08023 
were diagnosed as having narcolepsy with cataplexy. Patient NBB-
01064 was chronically treated with morphine for relief of her pain 
resulting from discopathy after her initial narcolepsy diagnosis. 
Patient NBB-08023 was not treated with opiates. Eight years later, 
patient NBB-01064 was reclassified as having idiopathic hypersomnia 
without cataplexy, an unusual clinical course, suggesting that the 
extended period of morphine administration may have changed the 
trajectory of the disease. Figure 6C shows hypocretin cell counts in 
the diagnosed narcoleptic patients with cataplexy: without morphine 
treatment (NBB-08023) and with morphine treatment (NBB-01064). 
The morphine-treated patient (NBB-01064) had 16% the number 
of hypocretin cells found in healthy controls compared to 3% for 
the narcoleptic with cataplexy patient not treated with morphine 
(NBB-08023).
DISCUSSION
Cells with different neurotransmitter phenotypes have been charac-
terized by various techniques since the early work of Falck et al. (12). 
Most current research studies use immunohistochemistry, the most 
sensitive technique, to identify and quantify these cell types in brain 
tissue representing normal and pathological human conditions. 
Hypocretin cell counts determined by immunohistochemistry (5) 
exceed those determined by genetic labeling (13) and RNA labeling 
(14). A relevant comparison is between our initial finding of an 
average of 71,000 hypocretin cells in human control brain tissue, 
with a 90% loss of these cells in brain tissue from patients with 
narcolepsy/cataplexy using immunohistochemistry (5, 15), and a 
contemporaneous report of 15,000 to 20,000 hypocretin cells in 
normal human control brain tissue and no detected hypocretin cells 
in patients with narcolepsy/cataplexy using in situ labeling (14). An 
independent study confirmed our immunohistochemistry work 
(Fig. 6C), finding surviving hypocretin cells in the brains of all 
human narcoleptic patients studied (16).

Immunohistochemistry can be combined with the measurement 
of immediate early gene expression (4) or with juxtacellular labeling 
and unit recording (10) to characterize the activity of identified cells 
in the brains of normal animals. Immunohistochemistry is also used 
to identify and study neuropathologies, including cell loss in narco-
lepsy, Huntington’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, 
and other disorders. Our findings in the current study suggest that 
this approach may be missing an important aspect of brain function. 
Under some drug administration or disease conditions, the number 
of cells of a particular phenotype visualized with immunohisto-
chemistry can change. A decrease in the number of cells can mis-
takenly be interpreted as representing neuronal death. However, 
increases of the sort we report here and that we and others have 
reported previously (17, 18) suggest that a portion of certain cell 
types do not produce immunohistochemically detectable amounts 
of their neurotransmitter under most conditions but can be induced 
to produce such amounts by drugs or perhaps by disease.
In recent work, we have shown that increasing hypocretin con-
tent by inhibiting microtubule polymerization with colchicine in 
mice increases the number of hypocretin cells detected by immuno-
histochemistry by as much as 40% in wild-type mice (19), similar to 
the amount we now see in mice after opiate administration. This 
raises the question of the extent to which the reduced number of 
hypocretin cells that characterizes human narcolepsy and other dis-
orders may, at least partially, be due to reduced production of hypo-
cretin in a subpopulation of hypocretin cells rather than the loss of 
hypocretin-producing cells through neuronal death. In mice given 
colchicine, the size of the hypocretin cells increases, possibly as a 
result of inhibition of axonal transport (16). One may speculate that 
the increased activity that we see in hypocretin neurons in mice after 
morphine administration has the opposite effect on cell size as 
colchicine administration. The action potentials associated with acti-
vation after morphine administration may cause hypocretin and 
other neuropeptides such as Narp and dynorphin to be transported

out of the neurons and down axons faster than they can be synthe-
sized, depleting the substrates and leading to shrinking of the cells.
Our work reported here shows that additionally recruited neurons 
after morphine administration in mice may not be uniformly dis-
tributed across the population of hypocretin cells. Further work will 
determine whether these neurons receive a different pattern of inputs, 
project to a different pattern of sites, or differ in other ways from the 
neuronal populations observed before opiate administration.
We show that the increased number of hypocretin neurons caused 
by morphine administration in mice was not due to neurogenesis. 
We also demonstrate that the increase in number lasted beyond the 
period when opiates would be readily detectable in the tissues of the 
mice. In mice, the time course of hypocretin cell number increase and 
cell size decrease differed. The increase required at least 2 weeks of high- 
dose morphine administration and returned to baseline by 8 weeks 
after administration. However, the cell size reduction in the same mice 
occurred within as little as 72 hours of morphine exposure, with hypo-
cretin cell size returning to baseline by 4 weeks after morphine treat-
ment. Morphine decreases the size of ventral tegmental area (VTA) 
neurons in rodents (20). Although a major increase (or decrease) in 
cell number of any neuronal group has not, to our knowledge, been 
reported with heroin or morphine administration in other studies, 
opiates have been shown to produce changes in dendritic field and 
spine morphology in the ventral tegmental field and nucleus accumbens, 
which may reflect altered release of dopamine from VTA cells (21).
We (4) and others (2) have demonstrated that increased hypo-
cretin cell activity is linked to pleasurable but not to aversive tasks 
in mice and rats. We have found that hypocretin is released in non-
addicted humans when they are engaged in enjoyable tasks but not 
when they are aroused by pain or feeling sad (3). Conversely, human 
narcoleptic patients, who have, on average, a 90% loss of detectable 
hypocretin cells (5), show increased depression and are relatively 
resistant to drug addiction (22). In opiate addicts, elevating hypo-
cretin production for long periods by self-administration of drug 
may create a positive mental state (affect), and a more negative 
affect is likely upon withdrawal of drug. This feedback loop may 
contribute to, or underlie, drug addiction.
Dopamine neurons, particularly those located in the VTA, have 
been strongly implicated in reinforcement in general and addiction 
in particular. Hypocretin and dopamine are evolutionarily linked 
from both a neurochemical and an anatomical perspective (23). 
The VTA receives a major hypocretin projection and projects to 
the nucleus accumbens. The amounts of dopamine and its major 
metabolites in the nucleus accumbens are markedly increased by 
the microinjection of hypocretin-1 and hypocretin-2 into the VTA. 
An intra-VTA injection of a selective hypocretin receptor-1 an-
tagonist, SB334867A, suppresses morphine-induced place prefer-
ence. Dopaminergic activation of neurons in the nucleus accumbens 
shell by morphine withdrawal requires the integrity of hypocretin 
receptor-1 (24).

hypocretin cells in the brains of narcoleptic DTA mice maintained throughout the experiment on DOX, with 14 days of daily saline injections, followed by sacrifice. The 
green bar shows the number of hypocretin cells in the brains of DTA mice after DOX withdrawal for 1.5 days, followed by restoration of DOX administration and saline 
injections for 14 days. A 30% reduction of hypocretin cells relative to control was observed. When daily morphine (100 mg/kg) injections were given instead of saline for 
14 days, the number of detected hypocretin cells was restored to baseline (blue bar). This difference was significant [***P = 0.003, t = 6.31, df = 4 (t test)]. Photomicrographs 
on the right show representative examples of hypocretin labeling in brains of DTA mice treated with saline (top) or morphine (bottom). Scale bar, 200 m. (B) Morphine 
administration (blue) to DTA mice decreased cataplexy after 1 and 2 weeks of administration relative to control DTA mice receiving saline injections (green). Treatment 
effect: F1,6 = 148.4, P = 0.0001 (ANOVA). Changes after saline administration were not significant. Post hoc comparisons with Bonferroni correction revealed a significant 
difference at P < 0.01 between the saline-treated control DTA mice and the morphine-treated DTA mice at both 1 and 2 weeks of treatment. (C) Immunohistochemical 
staining shows that brain tissue from a human narcoleptic patient with cataplexy (01064, blue) treated for a long period with morphine has a higher number of hypocre-
tin cells than does a case control narcoleptic patient with cataplexy (08023, yellow) not treated with morphine. The hypocretin cell counts in brain tissue from three 
control patients without narcolepsy or other identified neurological disorders are shown in green. The patients’ brains were willed to the Netherlands Brain Bank and 
preserved and analyzed using the same techniques (Table  1).

An in vitro brain slice study found that opioids decrease the 
activity of hypocretin neurons and that blockade of -opioid re-
ceptors enhances the activity of hypocretin neurons. Morphine pre-
treatment inhibited subsequent excitatory responses to hypocretin 
in hypocretin neurons recorded in vitro (21). However, our current 
in vivo data show that systemic administration of morphine in-
creased hypocretin neuron activity in rats, an effect presumably 
mediated at the neural circuit level, and therefore, this effect would 
not be seen in brain slices. Activation of hypocretin neurons rein-
states an extinguished preference for morphine in a rodent study (25).
The VTA, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, locus coeruleus, and 
central gray matter all have been implicated in reward mediation 
(26). Hypocretin cells also contain and release glutamate (27), 
trigger glutamate release from adjacent cells, and show Narp, an 
immediate early gene encoding a protein involved in aggregating 
AMPA receptors and thought to have a role in addiction (8). 
Bingham et al. (28) found that hypocretin, like morphine, produces 
profound analgesia. Aston-Jones et al. (29) showed that hypocretin 
was required for learning a morphine-conditioned place preference 
task. Georgescu et al. (30) showed that hypocretin neurons, but not 
nearby MCH neurons, express -opioid receptors. Cyclic adenosine 
5′-monophosphate response element–mediated transcription is 
induced in a subset of hypocretin cells, but not in MCH cells, 
after chronic exposure to morphine or induction of morphine 
withdrawal. In addition, c-Fos and the preprohypocretin gene 
are induced in hypocretin cells during morphine withdrawal. 
Constitutive hypocretin knockout mice develop attenuated mor-
phine dependence, indicated by a less severe antagonist-precipitated 
withdrawal syndrome (24).
It has long been anecdotally noted that narcoleptic patients, who 
have, on average, a 90% loss of hypocretin neurons (5), show little, 
if any, evidence of drug abuse or addiction, despite their daily pre-
scribed use of gamma hydroxybutyrate, methylphenidate, and 
amphetamines, drugs that are frequently abused. These data are 
consistent with our current finding of increased hypocretin cell 
populations in human heroin addicts, perhaps facilitating and 
maintaining addiction. The reduced number of hypocretin neurons 
in patients with narcolepsy may be related to the lack of drug addic-
tion in these patients.
Our study has several limitations. The first is that we were 
unable to determine the difference in the dynamics of the hypocretin 
cell increase in humans and mice and the return to baseline after 
opiate withdrawal. Of particular interest were the duration of in-
crease in the population of detected hypocretin neurons after cessa-
tion of opiate administration and whether it correlated with opiate 
craving in humans. Our discovery of tissues from a narcoleptic 
patient given morphine for pain management, a control narcoleptic 
patient not given such treatment, and neurologically normal control 
subjects, with all tissues preserved and analyzed in the same manner 
at the same brain bank, was unusual. This situation is highly unusu-
al because there are so few postmortem brains from narcoleptic pa-
tients in brain banks and fewer still where the narcoleptic patients 
have been given long-term opiate treatment. Another limitation of 
our study is that we do not yet know the mechanisms responsible 
for the sustained increase in hypocretin cells that we see in the mice 
and in human heroin addicts. The DTA mouse model may make 
elucidating the mechanisms underlying this increase possible.
In 1981, a report of a narcoleptic patient given codeine (a natural 
isomer of methylated morphine) for the control of Crohn’s disease 
symptoms described a “disappearance of his narcolepsy, cataplexy, 
sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations” (31). In a second 
case report, a narcoleptic patient, who could not continue taking 
stimulant drugs because of coronary artery disease and the necessity 
for kidney dialysis, urged his doctor to prescribe codeine for his 
narcolepsy because of the reversal of narcoleptic symptoms he 
had previously experienced when given codeine for pain. His physi-
cian published the results indicating a “dramatic improvement in 
alertness and substantial reduction of cataplexy,” the defining 
symptoms of narcolepsy (32). A third paper (33) tested codeine on 
eight narcoleptic patients. Sleep diaries and patient reports revealed 
consistent symptom improvement compared to placebo; however, 
there were no significant differences in the multiple sleep latency 
tests (cataplexy was not tested for). This ambiguous result from a 
1-week trial in three human patients appears to have ended opiate 
use for treatment of narcolepsy. In human studies, separating the 
placebo effect from the drug effect and from drug-seeking behavior 
can be difficult. We now show (Fig. 6B) that opiate treatment is 
effective in reducing or eliminating cataplexy in a mouse model of 
narcolepsy.
It is possible that, with the appropriate schedule of administra-
tion and dosage, opiate agonists might be an effective treatment for 
human narcolepsy. However, tests to determine the dose of opiate 
agonist with the least addictive potential and maximal safety and 
effectiveness would be required before any recommendation for 
opiate use in human narcoleptic patients. The autonomic effects of 
effective opiate agonist doses would need to be determined. An 
alternate approach might be to develop agonists that more specifi-
cally increase the number of hypocretin-producing neurons and 
thereby increase hypocretin production without the risks of more 
widespread neuronal activation. The development of appropriate 
transgenic mice would be an important step in this direction. One 
may also speculate that reducing the number of neurons producing 
detectable amounts of hypocretin to the level seen in nonaddicted 
human controls or reducing hypocretin action pharmacologically 
using opiate receptor antagonists might be a potential strategy for 
treating opiate addiction in humans.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
Immunohistochemistry was used to stain for hypocretin in human 
brain tissue from neurologically normal control individuals, heroin 
addicts, and patients with narcolepsy (Table 1). Human brain tissue 
was obtained from the National Neurological Research Specimen 
Bank (Los Angeles), the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute 
of Child Health and Human Development Brain Bank, and the 
Netherlands Brain Bank (Table 1). Parallel studies were done in 
wild-type mice and in a mouse model of narcolepsy in which selec-
tive hypocretin cell loss in mature animals was triggered by intracel-
lular expression of diphtheria toxin (DTA mice) in response to 
removal of mice from a DOX diet. These mice simulate the consensus 
understanding of the cause, developmental timing, and symptoms 
of human narcolepsy. The amount of mRNA and neuropeptides 
and the activity of hypocretin neurons were measured in the mice. 
The age and sex of mice used in each study are described in table S1. 
Morphine and control saline injections were performed at the same 
time in experimental and control groups. All tissue analyses were 
performed by experimenters blinded to treatment conditions.

Human hypothalamic tissue
The hypothalamus of five addicts, one morphine-treated narcoleptic 
with cataplexy, one narcoleptic with cataplexy patient not given mor-
phine, and nine control brains was examined for this study. Charac-
teristics of addicts, narcoleptics, and control subjects are summarized 
in Table 1. Five heroin addict and seven control brains were fixed in 
10% buffered formalin containing 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). 
The hypothalamus was cut into 40-m sections. Sections were immu-
nostained for hypocretin (orexin-A) and MCH. Adjacent sections 
were Nissl-stained. Human nuclear divisions are according Mai et al. 
(34). Two narcoleptic and three control brains were paraffin-embedded. 
Their sectioning and treatment are explained below.
Immunostaining for hypocretin and MCH in brain tissue 
from heroin addicts and control subjects
Immunostaining for hypocretin and MCH in 40-m sections of frozen 
tissue was performed as in our earlier reports (5, 7). The sections 
were treated with 0.5% sodium borohydride in phosphate-buffered 
saline (PBS) for 30 min, washed with PBS, and then incubated for 
30 min in 0.5% H2O2 for blocking of endogenous peroxidase activity. 
For antigen retrieval, sections were heated for 30 min at 80°C in 
a water bath with 10 mM sodium citrate (pH 8.5) solution. The 
sections were cooled to room temperature in sodium citrate and 
washed with PBS. After thorough washing with PBS, the sections 
were placed for 2 hours in 1.5% normal goat serum in PBS and incu-
bated for 72 hours at 4°C with a 1:10,000 dilution of Hcrt-1 (Rabbit 
Anti-Orexin A, H-003-30, Phoenix Pharmaceuticals Inc.). Sections 
were then incubated in a secondary antibody (biotinylated goat anti- 
rabbit immunoglobulin G, Vector Laboratories), followed by avidin- 
biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC Elite Kit, Vector Laboratories), for 
2 hours each at room temperature. The tissue-bound peroxidase was 
visualized by a diaminobenzidine (DAB) reaction (Vector Labora-
tories). Adjacent series of sections were immunostained for MCH 
(with a 1:20,000 polyclonal rabbit anti-MCH; H-070-47, Phoenix 
Pharmaceuticals Inc.). In all cases, the sectioning and staining were 
done blind to condition, with the same antibody lots used for all 
subgroups in each study.
Double labeling of neurons for hypocretin and Narp
After blocking using 3% normal donkey serum and 0.3% Triton X, 
sections were incubated with hypocretin antibody (orexin 1:1000, 
anti-goat; 8070, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Narp (1:1000; anti- 
rabbit, Worley laboratory, Johns Hopkins) for 72 hours. The sec-
ondary antibodies, Alexa Fluor 488 anti-goat (1:400) and Alexa Fluor 
568 anti-rabbit (1:400) (Invitrogen, Life Technologies Corporation), 
were used.
Quantitative analysis
Hypocretin and MCH cell number, distribution, and size were 
determined in human brain tissue using stereological techniques 
on a 1-in-12 series of 40-m sections through the complete hy-
pothalamus. We used a Nikon E600 microscope with three-axis 
motorized stage, video camera, Neurolucida interface, and Stereo 
Investigator software (MicroBrightField Corp.). Quantification of 
hypocretin and Narp double labeling were carried out using Zeiss 
Axio Imager M2. In human subjects, the complete hypothalamic re-
gion of one-half of the human brain was cut into 40-m-thick coro-
nal sections using a one-in-six section interval for each series. One 
series of sections were stained with cresyl violet for the localization 
of anatomical regions. Adjacent series of sections were immu-
nohistochemically stained for hypocretin. After staining, the sections 
were serially arranged and mounted on slides. Hypocretin cells were 
individually counted with the Neurolucida program. The final num-
ber reported is the number for the whole brain based on our systematic 
count. Sectioning, staining, and counting were done by investigators 
blind to condition. In our initial human studies (5, 7), we confirmed 
the results of stereological sampling with exhaustive counting of 
hypocretin neurons. In mice, we completely counted bilaterally the 
number of hypocretin neurons on a one-in-three series and reported 
the resulting number without multiplying by 3.
Hypocretin immunostaining in narcoleptic and control brain 
tissue (paraffin-fixed tissue)
Sections cut at 6 m were incubated with rabbit anti-hypocretin A 
antibody (catalog no. H-003-30, Phoenix Pharmaceuticals Inc.) at 
1:20,000 diluted in tris-buffered saline (TBS)–milk [5% (w/v) milk 
in 0.05 M tris and 0.15 M NaCl (pH 7.6)] for an hour at room 
temperature, followed by incubation overnight at 4°C. The next day, 
after rinsing in TBS, sections were incubated with goat anti-rabbit 
serum at 1:400 in TBS for 1 hour at room temperature. Antibody 
binding was visualized according to the ABC method at a 1:800 
dilution of these complexes in TBS for 1 hour at room temperature. 
After rinsing in TBS, staining was developed by DAB and nickel 
ammonium sulfate for about 20 min. Reactions were stopped by 
washing sections in distilled water. Finally, slides were dehydrated 
in an ascending series of alcohol and coverslipped in xylene with 
Entellan.
Counting procedure for paraffin sections
Only positively stained neurons containing a nucleolus were in-
cluded to prevent double counting. This counting procedure, which 
was judged to be the best for the thin (6 m) sections used, is based 
on the principle that nucleoli can be considered as hard particles 
that will not be sectioned by a microtome knife but, instead, are 
pushed either in or out of the paraffin when hit by the knife (35). All 
the cell counts were from one side of the hypothalamus. Completeness 
of the cell counting was confirmed by graphically presenting the 
actual number of neurons counted in every section from rostral to 
caudal to review the distribution pattern. If the most rostral or caudal 
sections still showed positive cells, we cut the remaining tissue so as 
to have a complete series. Following hypocretin staining, the total 
number of neurons was counted at 600-m intervals throughout the 
area. In each section, all hypocretin neurons with their typical cell 
profiles and a visible nucleolus serving as a unique marker for each 
neuron were counted using light microscopy at a magnification of 
400×. Taking into account the interval distances between individual 
sections, the total number of hypocretin neurons was determined on 
the basis of the Cavalieri principle (36).
Animal study
All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and 
Use Committee of the University of California at Los Angeles and the 
Veterans Administration Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System.
Morphine pellet study in mice

the study are detailed in table S1. Morphine (25 mg) pellets [from 
the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)] and placebo pellets 
(NIDA) were subcutaneously implanted with isoflurane anesthesia. 
There were three groups for the pellet study: (1) pellet implanted for 
3 days, (2) pellet implanted for 7 days, and (3) pellet implanted for 
14 days. For groups 2 and 3, the initial pellet was replaced after 
72 hours. All animals were sacrificed between 12:00 p.m. and 
2:00 p.m. Animals were anesthetized intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 
Fatal-Plus solution and then perfused transcardially with PBS, 
followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Brains were removed 
and post-fixed for 72 hours in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, fol-
lowed by 30% sucrose in PBS. The sections were cut at 40 m on a 
sliding microtome and stained for hypocretin as described earlier. 
Mouse nuclear divisions are as in McGregor et al. (4).
Morphine dose response in mice
A 14-day dose-response trial with daily administration of a fixed dose 
of morphine (morphine sulfate injection USP, Hospira Inc.) in each 
group of animals from 1 to 100 mg/kg body weight was conducted. 
The doses were 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 mg/kg. Control groups 
received saline injections. The morphine escalating dose started with 
100 mg/kg daily and was increased by 20% every 72 hours. For the 
60-day dose-response trial, there were three doses: 10, 25, and 50 mg/kg 
body weight. Control groups received saline. Injections were done 
at 10:00 a.m. in mice on a 12-hour/12-hour cycle with light onset at 
7:00 a.m. All animals were sacrificed between 12:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m.
Morphine (50 mg/kg) for 14 days and withdrawal  
for up to 6 months
To study the effect of morphine withdrawal on hypocretin neurons, 
we administered 50 mg/kg for 14 days to the mice. The control 
group received saline. Two-week, 4-week, 8-week, 16-week, and 26-week 
withdrawal durations were used.
Morphine (50 mg/kg) for 60 days and  
withdrawal up to 6 months
To study the effect of long-duration administration of morphine, 
we gave 50 mg/kg for 60 days. The control groups received saline. 
Two-week, 4-week, 8-week, 16-week, and 26-week withdrawal 
durations were used.
Investigation of neurogenesis after morphine  
treatment in mice
To look for evidence of neurogenesis after morphine treatment, 
BrdU was given intraperitoneally at 50 mg/kg in sterile saline once 
daily for 2 weeks. BrdU injection was done in morphine-treated 
(100 mg/kg) and saline-treated animals. Morphine injection was 
done in the morning, and BrdU injection was done in the evening 
for the 2-week period. Animals were sacrificed 2 weeks after the 
initial injection or 4 weeks after the end of 2 weeks of injection 
period. There were three animals in each experimental group.
Immunohistochemistry (40-m sections)
Brains were sectioned at 40 m in the frontal plane through the 
hypothalamus. Immunohistochemistry for BrdU was performed on 
every fourth, free-floating section. Tissue was pretreated for BrdU 
immunostaining by DNA denaturation (2 M HCl at 37°C for 30 min), 
followed by 10 min in borate buffer (pH 8.5). Sections were then 
incubated with rat anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody (1:400; Novus 
Biologicals) for 72 hours. Sections were developed using the ABC and 
DAB methods (Vector Elite). Doublecortin staining was done using goat 
anti-doublecortin C-18 (DCX 1:1000; no. sc-8066, Santa Cruz Biotech-
nology). Homozygous male hypocretin-deficient mice were injected 
with morphine (100 mg/kg) subcutaneously. The control group re-
ceived saline (n = 3 each group; table S1). The animals were sacrificed 
on day 14, and hypocretin immunohistochemistry was performed.
qPCR procedure
The morphine escalating dose started from 100 mg/kg and was esca-
lated by 20% every 72 hours, ending up at 180 mg/kg for 2 weeks. 
Brain samples from mice (eight saline-injected mice versus eight 
morphine-injected mice) were snap-frozen by dry ice and stored in 
−80°C. They were cut into 200-m sections in a cryostat at −18°C. 
The hypothalamus was bilaterally punched out by a prechilled 1.0-mm 
punching needle (Miltex Inc.). Brain tissue samples were pooled with 
two animals in each tube and immediately put back on dry ice. The 
tissue was homogenized with 1000 l of QIAzol Lysis Reagent 
(QIAGEN Sciences) and 200 l of chloroform (Merck). RNA was 
isolated according to the RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (catalog no. 
74804, QIAGEN) manufacturer’s protocol. RNA concentration and 
quality were measured by a Nanodrop TM ND-1000 spectropho-
tometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For each sample, 1000 ng of 
total RNA was used for synthesis of complementary DNA (cDNA), 
as described by the manufacturer’s protocol of the iScript cDNA 
Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories).
Primer sequences for preprohypocretin/orexin, preprodyn, and 
Narp GenBank accession code are indicated below. Primer sequences 
for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, tubulin -1A, ribo-
somal protein S28, actin-, ubiquitin C, and tubulin -4a (Tubb4a) 
were used as reference genes.
The qPCR procedures have been described previously (37). In 
short, qPCR was performed in a reaction volume of 20 l using the 
SYBR Green PCR Kit (Promega) and a mixture of sense and anti-
sense primers (2 pmol/l). Reactions were run in a GeneAmp 7300 
thermocycler under the following conditions: 2 min at 50°C and 10 min 
at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95°C and, finally, 1 min at 
60°C. Data were acquired and processed automatically by the Ap-
plied Biosystems Sequence Detection Software. Specificity of ampli-
fication was checked by melting curve analysis and electrophoresis 
of products on 1.5% agarose gel. Sterile water (nontemplate control) 
and omission of reverse transcriptase (non-RT control) during cDNA 
synthesis served as negative controls.
Amplification efficiency was determined by running qPCR reac-
tions on a dilution series of pooled cDNA from all the subjects. Result-
ing cycle threshold values were plotted against the inverse log of 
each dilution, and the slope of this curve was then used to calculate 
the efficiency as follows: Efficiency (E) = 10−/slope. The normaliza-
tion factor was based on the geometric mean of the following two 
most stable reference genes (that is, actin- and Tubb4a) out of six 
candidate reference genes selected by geNorm analysis (38). To 
minimize handling variations, each gene was measured in triplicate. 
The relative absolute amount of target genes calculated (39) was 
divided by the normalization factor.
Western blotting
The mouse hypothalamus was sonicated in lysis buffer containing 
50 mM tris-HCl, 50 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EDTA, and a protease in-
hibitor tablet (catalog no. 12482000, Roche) and was centrifuged at

800g (3000 rpm) for 30 min at 4°C. The protein concentration of 
the supernatant was determined using the DC Protein Assay Kit 
(catalog no. 500-0112, Bio-Rad). Protein (40 g) was loaded on a 
12% mini-protean TGX precast gel (catalog no. 456-1044, Bio-Rad) 
and separated at 50 V. The proteins were then transferred to a poly-
vinylidene difluoride membrane (catalog no. 162-0176, Bio-Rad) at 
50 mA for 2 hours. The membrane was washed in 20 mM tris, 
150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and then blocked in 
TBST containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk (NFDM) for 1 hour. 
The membrane was incubated with rabbit anti–polyphenol oxidase 
(PPO) (sc-28935, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit anti-MCH 
(sc-28931, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:1000 dilution in 2.5% NFDM 
in TBST overnight at 4°C. The next day, the membrane was washed 
in TBST before incubation with goat anti-rabbit horseradish per-
oxidase (HRP)–conjugated secondary antibody (catalog no. 31463, 
Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a dilution of 1:10,000 in 2.5% NFDM in 
TBST for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing in TBST, 
the antibody complex was visualized with SuperSignal West Femto 
(catalog no. 34094, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Anti–-actin (MAB1501R, 
Millipore) was used as an internal normalizer, at a dilution of 
1:10,000, with goat anti-mouse HRP-conjugated secondary antibody 
(catalog no. A2304, Sigma) at a dilution of 1:10,000. The densities of 
PPO, pro-MCH, and -actin bands for each sample were measured 
using ImageJ software.
Morphine administration to DTA mice
To create a model of orexin/hypocretin deficiency with closer fidelity 
to human narcolepsy, DTA was expressed in orexin neurons under 
control of the Tet-off system (Fig. 6A) (11). Male orexin-tTA; TetO 
DTA mice were maintained from weaning to 10 weeks of age on 
DOX (+) chow. To reduce the number of orexin neurons without 
elimination of the entire cell population, DOX (+) chow was re-
moved at 10 weeks of age and replaced with Labo MR stock food 
[DOX (−) condition] for 1.5 days, after which DOX (+) chow was 
reintroduced (1.5 days + restoration of DOX; n = 8). The experi-
mental group (n = 4) then received morphine (100 mg/kg) subcuta-
neously for 14 days, and the control group received (n = 4) saline. 
Two hours after last day injections, mice were deeply anesthetized 
with pentobarbital (100 mg/kg, i.p.) and perfused sequentially with 
15 ml of chilled saline and 15 ml of chilled 10% formalin solution 
(Wako). Brains were isolated and immersed in formalin solution 
for 72 hours at 4°C, followed by 30% sucrose. The sections were cut 
at 40 m and stained for hypocretin as described earlier.
Cataplexy in DTA mice treated with morphine
Female orexin-tTA; TetO DTA mice (40), aged 4 to 6 months fed 
DOX food from birth (as were their mothers before the birth of the 
pups), were placed on regular laboratory rodent food for 18 days 
and then back on DOX food (catalog no. TD.130840, Teklad) for 
1 to 2 months (Fig. 6B). The mice were singly housed (lights on 
at 6:00 a.m. and off at 6:00 p.m.). The mice were recorded from 
5:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. the next day, via a LOREX DV700 recording 
system with a 1080p HD MPX DVR. Chocolate (“Hershey’s kisses,” 
milk chocolate) was given at 6:00 p.m. to enhance cataplexy attacks 
(11). Baseline cataplexy was recorded between 6:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. 
the next morning, 1 day before morphine treatment commenced. 
At 10:00 a.m., the mice were injected subcutaneously with either 
saline or morphine (50 mg/kg). Morphine or saline was adminis-
tered every day at 10:00 a.m. for 2 weeks. Overnight video recording 
was repeated weekly, after 1 and 2 weeks of morphine or saline 
injections and for 3 weeks after the termination of morphine/saline 
treatment. The number of cataplexy bouts was scored for the first 
2 hours (from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.) of the dark phase. Cataplexy 
was scored on the basis of the criteria of Chemelli et al. (9) and 
Scammell et al. (41): an abrupt episode of nuchal atonia with immo-
bility lasting at least 10 s, with at least 40 s of wakefulness preceding 
the episode. The number of cataplexy episodes was normalized with 
each subject’s baseline score and was expressed as the percentage of 
saline control on week 1.
Effect of morphine on hypocretin cell activity in vivo
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories) weighing 250 
to 300 g were used (n = 3). Hypocretin cells were recorded from the 
hypothalamus using microwire recording techniques as described 
previously (42). Under isoflurane anesthesia, microdrives contain-
ing 25-m stainless steel microwires (California Fine Wire Co.) aimed 
at the lateral hypothalamic area were implanted, with the tip of the 
electrodes 0.5 mm above the target area. Stainless steel screw elec-
trodes were placed over the sensorimotor cortex for EEG, and EMG 
activity was recorded from the dorsal neck muscles with Teflon- 
coated multistranded stainless steel wires (Cooner Wire). Animals 
were free to move around the recording chamber. Electrodes were 
moved in 80-m steps until a cell or cells with signal-to-noise ratio 
of at least 2:1 were isolated. The activity of each cell was then char-
acterized throughout sleep/waking states. Waking-specific cells that 
fit the profile of hypocretin cells (10) were studied after intraperito-
neal injections of morphine (10 to 15 mg/kg) with continuous 
recording of neuronal activity for at least 3 hours.
Statistical analysis
The figure legends contain statistical details. The numbers of sub-
jects in each human and animal study are indicated in Table 1 and 
table S1, respectively. Summary statistics are presented, with prob-
ability and df, in the figure legends. Unmatched two-tailed t tests or 
ANOVAs were used as appropriate. The number of subjects was 
determined in each group, generating data according to the formula: 
n = (z score)2 × SD × (1 − SD)/(margin of error)2 with  set at 0.05 
and power set at 80%.

Funding: This study was supported by NIDA grant DA034748, the Medical Research Service of 
the Department of Veterans Affairs grant BX001753 (J.M.S.), NARSAD Young Investigator Grant 
from the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation (L.S.), and grant R35NS097966 (P.F.W.). 
Author contributions: T.C.T. collected and analyzed the morphine administration data from 
the wild-type mice. T.C.T. and J.J. analyzed the data from human opiate addicts. J.J. collected 
BrdU and doublecortin labeling data. L.S. measured changes in mRNA of preprohypocretin, 
Narp, and preprodynorphin after morphine administration and identified and analyzed the 
data on hypocretin in postmortem brain tissue from human narcoleptic patients and control 
individuals together with D.F.S. M.-F.W. did the neuronal recording in freely moving rats in 
response to morphine and analyzed the effects of opiates on narcolepsy in hypocretin-
depleted mice. L.R. studied the effects of morphine on preprohypocretin and preproMCH 
using Western blotting. R.M. assisted in neuronal recording from hypocretin cells. K.-T.C. 
conducted quantitative microscopic analysis of control and opiate-treated wild-type mice  
and of DTA hypocretin-depleted and morphine-treated DTA mice. M.C. conducted 
neuropathological screening on all of the human postmortem brains. A.Y. created the DTA 
mouse line, and A.I. performed the hypocretin depletion experiments and the reversal of the 
reduced number of neurons detected after morphine administration. R.F. and G.J.L. diagnosed 
and treated the human narcoleptic patients. R.F. counted the hypocretin neurons in three 
control brains from the Netherlands Brain Bank. P.F.W. assisted with the Narp analysis. J.M.S. 
advised on all studies and wrote the initial and final drafts of the manuscript. All authors assisted 
in writing the paper. Competing interests: G.J.L. consults for Jazz Pharmaceuticals and 
Bioprojet. All other authors declare that they have no competing interests. Data and 
materials availability: All data are in the paper and the Supplementary Materials.
