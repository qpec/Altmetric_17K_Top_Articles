bjective: Established methods of self-monitoring of glucose levels include capillary self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and 
interstitial continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Flash CGM is a novel form of self-monitoring that provides on-demand continuous 
interstitial glucose profiles. The purpose of this article is to critically review the recent outcome data from randomized controlled 
trials that assessed the efficacy and safety of flash CGM to replace routine SMBG in diabetes management. Methods: Two recent six-month, 
prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trials in type 1 (IMPACT; NCT02232698) and type 2 (REPLACE; NCT02082184) diabetes compared 
flash CGM with SMBG under otherwise usual care conditions. The trials did not use a prescribed treatment algorithm based on self-monitoring of 
glucose. Results: Both trials demonstrated that the time spent in hypoglycemia over a 24-hour period, as well as overnight, was markedly reduced 
by flash CGM without deterioration in glycated hemoglobin (A1C) levels. In IMPACT there was a 38% reduction in time in hypoglycemia with flash 
CGM versus SMBG, and in REPLACE there was a 43% reduction in time in hypoglycemia with flash CGM compared with SMBG. Moreover, patient 
satisfaction improved with flash CGM, usage adherence rates were high, and flash CGM was well tolerated. Conclusions: The findings from these 
trials suggest that improved care outcomes can be achieved when flash CGM is integrated into current established clinical care paradigms. Flash 
CGM provides important advantages over SMBG that are likely to be applicable to real-world care of individuals with differing forms of diabetes 
requiring intensive insulin treatment.

The main priorities in diabetes care include prompt recognition and 
minimization of hypoglycemia while optimizing glucose control and 
glycated hemoglobin (A1C) levels. To achieve this, individuals need accurate 
and clear information about their glucose levels. There are practical limits 
to the frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) that can be 
performed daily, which means that testing tends to focus on pre-meal 
glucose levels and relies on patient motivation and compliance.1 The 
intermittent snapshots of blood glucose provided by SMBG do not provide 
information for large parts of the day or night. Newer glucose monitoring 
approaches enable additional testing to be performed at regular intervals, 
and provide more information than would be feasible with SMBG. This 
includes comprehensive data on the 24-hour glucose profile; the current 
glucose trend (up or down); glucose variability; detection of periods of 
hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia; and estimated A1C.1 
Advantages and disadvantages of currently 
available glucose monitoring approaches
Self-monitoring of blood glucose
SMBG based on finger-prick testing of capillary blood using glucose test 
strips is generally performed at intervals throughout the day (typically 
four to eight times daily, depending on the individual).2 Current guidelines 
for type 1 diabetes (T1D) recommend testing at a frequency to optimize 
diabetes control, because frequency of SMBG correlates with glycemic 
control.3 The practical limitations of SMBG mean that it has a limited 
frequency of use, and hence it does not provide optimal information to 
examine glucose variability, periods of hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic risk,

or overnight glycemic control. Furthermore, finger-prick blood sampling can 
be painful. Along with cost, needle fear, and social stigma, poor motivation 
and inconvenience may contribute to variable adherence with SMBG.4 
Direct financial costs associated with SMBG are lower than traditional 
continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and possibly also flash continuous 
glucose monitoring (flash CGM), although the cost is dependent on the 
number of test strips used daily.2 
Traditional continuous glucose monitoring
Traditional CGM is predominantly utilized by individuals with T1D who have 
received extensive training in how to use the monitoring system. It involves 
continuous glucose sensing with passive relay of information from sensor 
to receiver for use by the individual.2 Traditional CGM provides constantly 
updated information on glucose levels and can provide audible alarms if 
programmed glucose thresholds are at risk of being, or are, transgressed. 
CGM sensors can be linked to an insulin pump that automatically suspends 
insulin administration based on glucose readings. However, systems need 
to be calibrated twice daily with finger-prick capillary glucose measures. 
The cost of traditional CGM, which is significantly higher than SMBG in the 
US,2 may affect patient accessibility. Clinical adoption of traditional CGM 
is also hampered by a lack of standardized reporting of glucose data and 
difficulty in evaluating the large amount of data produced by such systems.5 
Patient acceptability of, and therefore adherence to, traditional CGM 
 
use may limit the potential benefits of this monitoring approach. Studies 
have demonstrated that traditional CGM use declines over time, particularly 
in adolescents.6–8 
Flash continuous glucose monitoring 
Flash CGM systems comprise a reader and a factory-calibrated sensor 
 
(1.4 inches wide x 0.20 inches high) with a filament inserted under the 
skin of the back of the arm and held in place by an adhesive.1 The sensor 
is powered by a battery and functions for up to 14 days once activated. 
 
A 0.20 inch length filament on the sensor measures interstitial glucose at 
regular intervals and the sensor stores up to 8 hours of continuous glucose 
data. The sensor is scanned by a reader that provides a current glucose 
reading, glucose trend (indicated by an arrow), and an 8-hour continuous 
glucose profile. A key differentiating feature of flash CGM compared with 
traditional CGM is that flash CGM involves active user engagement to 
transfer data, which must be performed at least once every 8 hours to 
transfer all collected data. Data are stored in the reader for up to 90 days. 
This can be used to generate a detailed ambulatory glucose profile (AGP) 
report that facilitates detection of glycemic patterns and trends over the 
duration of sensor wear. Flash CGM does not require user calibration and 
replaces routine SMBG for treatment decisions, except in the following 
circumstances: if hypoglycemia or impending hypoglycemia is reported, 
when clinical symptoms do not match the system readings, or during 
periods of rapid glucose change.2
Flash CGM provides individuals with easily accessible information on 
their glucose levels over the whole day, identifies times of day when they 
are more at risk of low or high glucose levels, and details their glucose 
variability. This information can enable individuals to optimize their 
glycemic control, while avoiding undue hypoglycemic risk. The flash CGM 
system does not produce audible alarms when glucose levels are beyond 
specified thresholds, which may be beneficial in reducing alarm fatigue, 
a common cause for discontinuation of traditional CGM devices. This can 
occur when users experience too many alarms overall and false alarms in 
particular, which may lead them to either ignore or silence hypoglycemia 
alarms.9 However, for other individuals who find alarms helpful, the lack 
of this feature may be a limitation. In addition, given that flash CGM is a 
relatively new method, there are fewer studies available than with SMBG 
and traditional CGM. Consequently, currently flash CGM is not widely 
mentioned in established clinical care guidelines. The cost of flash CGM 
is lower than that of traditional CGM, and is potentially similar to SMBG 
depending on the number of blood glucose test strips used.2
There are a number of differences across the various glucose monitoring 
methods (see Table 1).1,2 In particular, SMBG measures capillary blood 
glucose, whereas both traditional CGM and flash CGM measure interstitial 
glucose. Flash CGM measurements have been shown to be clinically 
accurate compared with capillary measurements over 14 days of wear, and 
are unaffected by patient factors such as body mass index, age, type of 
diabetes, insulin use, or A1C level.10 Furthermore, regular glucose testing 
with flash CGM or traditional CGM provides a more informative glucose 
profile versus SMBG. Flash CGM report interpretation is aided by both real-
time trend profiles and standardized AGP software.11 This software presents 
data over a representative 24-hour period and provides glucose pattern 
insights. A distinguishing feature of current flash CGM systems is the lack of 
need for user calibration, which may add to the convenience of flash CGM 
over traditional CGM systems.
Recently, two large clinical trials, conducted with flash CGM in individuals 
with T1D and type 2 diabetes (T2D), have been published.12,13 The objective 
of this review is to summarize recent data from these randomized 
controlled trials which assessed the efficacy and safety of flash CGM to 
replace routine SMBG in diabetes management.

Flash Continuous Glucose Monitoring in the Management of Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes 
examined the use of the FreeStyle Libre™ (Abbott Diabetes Care, Alameda, 
California, US) flash CGM system compared with SMBG in the management 
of T1D and T2D, respectively. 
IMPACT randomized 241 adults aged ≥18 years with T1D for ≥5 years, who 
had been on their current insulin regimen for ≥3 months prior to study 
entry, had a screening for A1C ≤7.5% (58 mmol/mol), and had reported 
blood glucose readings on a regular basis equivalent to ≥3-times daily for 
≥2 months prior to study entry.12 REPLACE randomized 224 adults aged 
≥18 years with T2D treated with intensive insulin therapy, A1C 7.5–12.0% 
(58–108 mmol/mol) and ≥10 blood glucose tests/week for ≥2 months 
prior to study entry.13 For safety reasons, individuals judged to have 
ongoing, clinically significant hypoglycemia unawareness were excluded 
from either study.
IMPACT and REPLACE shared a similar study design (see Figure 1). 
During baseline, all individuals wore a masked sensor system (modified 
FreeStyle Libre™) for 14 days. Throughout this period, sensor glucose 
measurements were blinded for both the participant and the investigator. 
Diabetes management during this period was performed based on 
SMBG. Individuals were randomized 1:1 (IMPACT) and 2:1 (REPLACE) to 
utilizing flash CGM sensor data for self-management or continuing to use 
SMBG. There were no protocol-mandated insulin adjustments; instead, 
individuals adjusted their treatment based on local clinical care protocols. 
Individuals were encouraged to self-manage utilizing current or historical 
glucose data including avoidance of hypoglycemia. Glucose control and 
readings in both groups were formally reviewed at clinic visits.12 In T2D, 
management aimed to avoid hypoglycemia, optimize fasting glucose, and 
reduce postprandial glucose excursions.13 At 3 and 6 months in IMPACT, 
and at 6 months in REPLACE, individuals in the control group wore masked 
sensors for reassessment of glycemic parameters. A key limitation of the 
study design of IMPACT was that patients with quite well-controlled T1D 
(with A1C below 7.5% [59 mmol/mol]) were included since such patients 
are theoretically at higher risk of hypoglycemia14 and hypoglycemia 
duration was the primary endpoint of the study. Recruited participants 
may not be representative of the eligible population of individuals with 
T1D. Similarly, in REPLACE, only patients receiving intensive insulin 
therapy performing regular glucose testing were included, again limiting 
the generalizability of the data. For example, people with T2D receiving 
basal insulin injections only or biphasic insulin were not included in the 
REPLACE study.
Primary endpoints
The primary study endpoints were the difference in time in hypoglycemia 
<70 mg/dL (<3.9 mmol/L) in IMPACT, and the difference in A1C in REPLACE 
(see Table 2).12,13 
Key secondary endpoints
The key secondary endpoints in IMPACT and REPLACE are presented in 
Table 2. They included time in range (70–180 mg/dL [3.9–10.0 mmol/L]), time 
in hyperglycemia, and glucose variability.12,13 
Safety
Adverse events (AEs) and sensor insertion-site symptoms were monitored 
throughout the study. In addition, severe hypoglycemia (requiring third-
party assistance) was assessed.
Clinical implications of flash continuous  
glucose monitoring 
The study designs of IMPACT and REPLACE reflect real-world clinical 
practice, as there were no protocol-mandated treatment adjustments.12,13 
As such, individual centers utilized flash CGM to inform and guide 
treatment based on local clinical practice. Flash CGM was found to result 
in significant reductions in hypoglycemia in both trials, regardless of the 
threshold or type of hypoglycemia measure. In IMPACT (T1D), the daily time 
in hypoglycemia was reduced by 1.4 h/day in the flash CGM group (from 3.4 
to 2.0 h/day) and by 0.2 h (from 3.4 to 3.3 h/day) in the SMBG group (mean 
between-group difference ± standard error [SE]: -1.2 ± 0.2 h/day; p<0.0001). 
This equates to a 38% reduction in time in hypoglycemia with flash CGM 
versus SMBG (see Figure 2A). In REPLACE (T2D), daily time in hypoglycemia 
was reduced by 0.7 h/day (from 1.3 to 0.6 h/day) in the flash CGM group 
and by 0.1 h/day (from 1.1 to 1.0 h/day) in the SMBG group (mean between-
group difference ± SE: -0.5 ± 0.1 h/day; p=0.0006). This equates to a 43% 
reduction in time in hypoglycemia with flash CGM, compared with SMBG 
(see Figure 2B). In IMPACT, there were seven hypoglycemia-related serious 
AEs (requiring hospitalization or third-party intervention), occurring in six 
individuals: two in the intervention group (two individuals) and four in the 
control group (three individuals).

Review  Diabetes
Among the secondary endpoints, IMPACT and REPLACE also demonstrated 
significant reductions in time in nocturnal hypoglycemia (occurring between 
23:00 and 06:00) with flash CGM, notably in the absence of alarms. In T1D, 
time in nocturnal hypoglycemia 70 mg/dL (<3.9 mmol/L) was reduced by 
40% with flash CGM compared with control (p<0.0001). Time in nocturnal 
hypoglycemia was reduced by 0.64 h with flash CGM (1.32 h to 0.68 h) and 
by 0.25 h (1.48 h to 1.23 h) with SMBG (mean between-group difference: 
-0.47 h). In T2D, time in nocturnal hypoglycemia 70 mg/dL (<3.9 mmol/L) 
was reduced by 54% with flash CGM versus control (p=0.0001). Time in 
nocturnal hypoglycemia decreased from 0.55 to 0.23 h with flash CGM, 
and was unchanged from 0.49 to 0.51 h with SMBG (mean between-group 
difference: -0.29 h).
Despite a reduction in hypoglycemia with flash CGM in both T1D and T2D, 
A1C did not increase in either study.12,13 In T1D, there was no significant 
adjusted mean change in A1C from baseline with flash CGM (adjusted 
mean difference in A1C between flash CGM and SMBG ± SE: 0.00 ± 
0.06%; p=0.96).12 In T2D, a reduction in A1C was reported in the flash CGM 
group (-0.29 ± 0.07%) and in the control group (-0.31 ± 0.09%; adjusted 
mean difference in A1C between flash CGM and SMBG ± SE: 0.03 ± 
0.11%; p=0.82).13 Therefore, individuals in IMPACT and REPLACE made 
appropriate insulin dosing decisions based on sensor readings, with less 
hypoglycemia experienced than control individuals who utilized SMBG 
for these decisions.10,12,13 Glycemic clinical outcomes in both IMPACT and 
REPLACE were positive, in that there was no compromise in A1C with flash 
CGM versus SMBG in either study, despite the reduction in hypoglycemia 
with flash CGM.12,13 With respect to glucose variability, in IMPACT, time in the 
target glucose range was improved with flash CGM compared with SMBG 
by 1.0 ± 0.30 h/day (adjusted mean ± SE; p=0.0006)12; glucose variability was 
improved with flash CGM versus SMBG in both studies (glucose coefficient 
of variation: difference in IMPACT -4.4 ± 0.6, p<0.0001; difference in 
REPLACE -2.3 ± 0.7, p=0.0017). 
In both studies, blood glucose testing was significantly reduced in the flash 
CGM group and was effectively replaced with sensor readings. In the flash 
CGM group in IMPACT, the mean number of sensor scans was 15.1 per 
day, and the mean number of SMBG tests decreased from 5.5 per day at 
baseline to 0.5 per day at 6 months; in the SMBG group, the number of 
SMBG tests remained constant (5.8 per day at baseline; 5.6 per day at 6 
months).12 Similarly, in the flash CGM group in REPLACE, the mean number 
of sensor scans was 8.3 per day, and the mean number of SMBG tests fell 
from 3.8 per day at baseline to 0.3 per day over 6 months; in the SMBG 
group, there was no change in the number of SMBG tests (3.9 per day at 
baseline and 3.8 at 6 months).13
Based on computer modeling (in silico simulations), it has been suggested 
that glucose sensors with a mean absolute relative difference (MARD) of 
10% or less may be considered safe for insulin dosing decisions.15 However, 
in IMPACT and REPLACE, real-world use of a sensor system with a 
published MARD of 11.4%10 resulted in appropriate insulin dosing decisions, 
significantly less hypoglycemia, and comparable glycemic control versus 
SMBG. Therefore, clinical data from IMPACT and REPLACE do not support 
an in silico-defined MARD threshold of ≤10% for sensor-based treatment 
decisions in adults. These data are likely of greater value to the clinician 
as they reflect real-world clinical use of flash CGM rather than in silico 
simulations of sensor use.12,13,15 
Quality of life (QoL) data in both IMPACT and REPLACE showed greater 
treatment satisfaction with flash CGM compared with SMBG. In IMPACT, 
individuals with T1D reported significantly improved results in the Diabetes 
Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ) total treatment satisfaction 
with flash CGM versus SMBG (13.3 and 7.2, respectively; p<0.0001) (see 
Table 3). Similarly, Diabetes Quality of Life (DQoL) satisfaction with treatment, 
which evaluates the burden of an intensive diabetes treatment regimen, 
was significantly improved with flash CGM versus SMBG (-0.17 and 0.07, 
respectively; p<0.0001).13 In REPLACE, individuals with T2D utilizing flash CGM 
had a significantly improved mean DTSQ total treatment satisfaction score of 
13.1 versus 9.0 with SMBG (p<0.0001). DQoL satisfaction with treatment was 
also significantly improved with flash CGM compared with SMBG (-0.2 versus 
0.0, respectively; p=0.0259). These data indicate improved QoL in individuals 
with either type of diabetes using insulin therapy.

Flash Continuous Glucose Monitoring in the Management of Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes 
Adherence to SMBG has been reported to be as low as 44% in T1D and 
24% in T2D.16 Given that flash CGM provides continuous, unobtrusive, 
and convenient glucose monitoring without the need for routine blood 
glucose tests, it may improve patient adherence versus SMBG. High rates 
of adherence to flash CGM were seen in both studies: the percentage of 
available data collected was 92.8% in IMPACT and 88.7% in REPLACE. This 
high rate of adherence to flash CGM was associated with >94% (n=68/72) 
of individuals giving favorable ratings for flash CGM compared to finger-
stick testing, in terms of sensor comfort, ease of wear, compatibility with 
everyday activities, pain experienced, ease of use, and erythema or edema 
occurring when the sensor was removed.10 
Flash CGM provides users with detailed, readily accessible glucose data.1 
The flash CGM reader provides a continuous glucose profile over the 
previous 8 hours and the glucose trend, as well as historical data over 
the previous 90 days (see Figure 3A). Data provided by the sensor can 
be analyzed to generate a standardized AGP report, which facilitates 
glucose pattern recognition over a representative 24-hour period (see 
Figure 3B).11 The AGP provides users with information on hypoglycemia 
and hyperglycemia trends, and can quickly identify times when glucose 
control is not optimal. AGP gives both individuals with diabetes and their 
healthcare providers (HCPs) an important tool for understanding their 
glycemic patterns and can be used by HCPs for educational purposes.1
Flash CGM was well tolerated in both studies. Common AEs in the two 
trials included skin reactions related to wearing the sensor.12,13 In IMPACT, 
13 sensor site reactions were reported in 10/119 individuals (8.4%). In 
REPLACE, 6/149 individuals (4.0%) experienced sensor site reaction AEs. 
The event rate of these reactions was well within what would be expected 
for a device with a medical-grade adhesive. In IMPACT, 215 anticipated 
sensor insertion-site symptoms (non-adverse events) were reported in 
47/119 individuals (39.5%). In REPLACE, 143 anticipated sensor insertion-
site symptoms were reported in 41/149 individuals (27.5%).
In both T1D (IMPACT) and T2D (REPLACE), flash CGM allowed users to 
significantly decrease their time in hypoglycemia without worsening 
glycemic control as measured by A1C. These benefits were accompanied 
by significant decreases in blood glucose testing and effective replacement 
of sensor readings for SMBG in treatment decisions. The clinical benefits 
observed may reflect improved management by individuals empowered 
by the comprehensive and convenient glucose measurements available 
with flash CGM, as well as the more easily accessible historical data. 
For example, the reductions in nocturnal hypoglycemia without alarms 
may reflect individuals’ ability to utilize historical sensor glucose data 
trends and patterns to make therapy changes, perhaps by adjusting 
their bedtime insulin dose or pre-bedtime carbohydrate intake. The 
observation that reductions in hypoglycemia occurred within the first two 
weeks of real-time sensor use provides further evidence that patient-
driven changes in therapy based on access to comprehensive glucose 
information from flash CGM may underlie the clinical benefits seen with 
this new technology.
Conclusions
The clinical trial experience with flash CGM in T1D (IMPACT) and T2D 
(REPLACE) demonstrates statistically and clinically significant benefits in 
the reduction of nocturnal and overall hypoglycemia without compromising 
glycemic control. These findings have implications for improving the care 
of individuals with diabetes on insulin therapy. Reducing the occurrence of 
hypoglycemia has important effects on patient QoL, including benefits in 
both short- and long-term physical wellbeing, ability to maintain work and 
life commitments, and self-confidence in disease management. Enabling 
individuals to manage their glucose levels while minimizing hypoglycemia 
facilitates increased confidence to achieve better control.17 Interestingly, in 
both IMPACT and REPLACE, individuals reported improved QoL and greater 
treatment satisfaction with flash CGM versus SMBG.12,13 Previous studies 
have reported perceived diabetes control as a key aspect of increasing 
treatment satisfaction.18 It is possible that the improvements in QoL in 
IMPACT and REPLACE at least partly reflect a perception among individuals 
in the flash CGM group that they were more in control of their diabetes. 
Flash CGM is still relatively new but these key clinical trials in T1D (IMPACT) 
and T2D (REPLACE) suggest that improved outcomes can be achieved 
when this technology is integrated into established clinical care paradigms. 
Further comparative data are needed, in particular, from head-to-head 
studies comparing flash CGM with traditional CGM. Such studies would 
provide a better understanding of the relative advantages of flash CGM and 
its role in diabetes management.

Reader display with continuous glucose data provided over the previous 8 hours, as well 
as the current glucose reading and a trend arrow (A). Example of an ambulatory glucose 
report, including 14 days of data derived from the Freestyle Libre™ flash CGM System (B). 
The user-friendly report helps to identify when desirable outcomes in glycemic control 
are being realized (empty circles) and areas for concern and improvement (partially or 
completely filled circles). In this example, the main issues of concern identified are low 
glucose readings overnight and into the early morning hours, and moderate glucose 
variability between the days of data collection (B).
