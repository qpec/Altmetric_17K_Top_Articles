Abstract
Objectives
There is highly suggestive evidence for an effect of air pollution exposure on dementia-
related outcomes, but evidence is not yet present to clearly pinpoint which pollutants are the
probable causal agents. The aims of this study was to assess the longitudinal association
between exposures of fine ambient particulate matter (PM2.5) from residential wood burning,
and vehicle exhaust, with dementia.
Method
We used data from the Betula study, a longitudinal study of dementia in Umeå, Northern
Sweden. The study size was 1 806 and the participants were followed from study entry
(1993–1995) to 2010. Modelled levels of source-specific fine particulate matter at the resi-
dential address were combined with information on wood stoves or wood boilers, and with
validated data on dementia diagnosis and individual-level characteristics from the Betula
study. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate Hazard Ratios (HRs) and
their 95% CIs for dementia incidence (vascular dementia and Alzheimer’s disease),
adjusted for individual-level characteristics.
Results
The emission of PM2.5 from local residential wood burning was associated with dementia
incidence with a hazard ratio of 1.55 for a 1 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 (95% Confidence Inter-
val (CI): 1.00–2.41, p-value 0.05). Study participants with an address in an area with the
highest quartile of PM2.5 from residential wood burning and who also had a wood-burning
stove were more likely to develop dementia than those in the lower three quartiles without a
wood-burning stove with hazard ratios of 1.74 (CI: 1.10–2.75, p-value 0.018). Particulate
matter from traffic exhaust seemed to be associated with dementia incidence with hazard

Conclusions
If the associations we observed are causal, then air pollution from residential wood burning,
and air pollution from traffic, might be independent important risk factors for dementia.
Introduction
Dementia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. By 2050, the number of Alz-
heimer’s Disease (AD) patients is expected to rise to over 130 million from today’s 47 million
[1]. The mechanisms behind dementia are not fully understood but likely includes genetic,
physiological and cognitive factors.
In a study from Northern Sweden, we have previously observed residential concentrations
of traffic-related air pollution to be a risk factor for vascular dementia and AD, with an attrib-
utable fraction of 16% [2]. Chen and colleagues later showed that living close to heavy traffic
was associated with dementia in Canada, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.07 (CI: 1.06–
1.08) for people living less than 50 m from a major traffic road as compared with living further
than 300 m[3]. In two early studies from Taiwan, NO2 was correlated with elevated risk of
dementia, with a HR of 1.54 (CI: 1.34–1.77) in quartile 4 versus quartile 1[4], and a 4.34 μg/m3
increase in particulate matter 2,5 μm or less in diameter (PM2.5) was associated with an HR of
2.38 (CI: 2.21–2.56) [5]. Furthermore, Cacciottolo and colleagues found that residing in places
with PM2.5 exceeding US Environmental Protection Agency standards increased the risks for
dementia by 92% [6]. A review from 2016 concludes that it is highly plausible, that air pollu-
tion has an effect on cognition, but current evidences does not clearly pinpoint which pollut-
ants are the probable causal agents[7].
Wood smoke is a natural substance why there is a general sentiment that it must be benign.
However, it is scientifically well established that biomass burning emits health-damaging pol-
lutants, including several carcinogenic compounds [8]. Domestic wood smoke at high levels,
as when cooking is done indoors without chimneys[8], can cause hypertension, affect respira-
tory health[9] and artery intima-media thickness, cause a rise in the prevalence of atheroscle-
rotic plaques[10] and even cause lung cancer [11]. Experimental evidence indicate that
particles stemming from wood burning may have similar health effects as particles stemming
from traffic [8, 12, 13]. Indoor wood smoke at high doses is thus a well-established cause of
morbidity and mortality, but little is known about the health effects at lower doses. Small-scale
heating may be a substantial contributor to ambient PM2.5 levels in certain residential areas, in
high-income countries. For example, the biomass contribution to air pollution levels in small
country towns in Sweden can be extensive, leading to levels of particles comparable to busy
street canyons in major cities [12]. Due to climate mitigation policies, there are incentives lead-
ing to an increase in biomass burning, but knowledge of the health effects of such policy is
scant [14, 15].
It has not been possible in previous epidemiological studies to investigate air pollution from
residential wood burning as a possible causal agent because to do so it is necessary to resolve
the strong gradients close to major emission sources, such as appliances for small scale residen-
tial heating. Such detailed exposure data is now available in parts of Sweden. With that expo-
sure data, PM from wood burning was estimated to cause a larger or comparable number of

 annual deaths (depending on location and risk estimate used) than traffic-related air pollution
[16]. Combined with data from a longitudinal cohort study on dementia, this detailed expo-
sure data allow us to investigate our objectives; if exposure to particles from residential wood
burning, and particles from vehicle exhaust, are associated with dementia incidence. In addi-
tion we use the information from chimney sweepers to study the effect of indoor sources.
Methods
To determine whether there is a link between exposure to combustion particles and dementia
incidence, we linked new source-specific particle data on fine particulate matter (PM2.5) with
data from a previous study on traffic-related air pollution (where air pollution exposure was
assessed by NOx concentrations from a land use regression model) and dementia incidence
[2].
Three data sets was used in this study. The first data set was longitudinal data from the
Betula study on dementia diagnosis and individual-level characteristics which we used in our
previous study[2]. The second and third data set was on emission sources (e.g. traffic flows
and stoves) which yielded modelled levels of particle pollution and information on residential
addresses from Statistics Sweden. The data sets were combined by linking the residential
address at start of follow-up period in the Betula study with source-specific fine particulate air
pollution levels from the 50 m x 50 m grid square in which each participant’s home was
located.
The betula study
The Betula study is a longitudinal cohort that was initially motivated by the need to explore
various aspects of health and cognitive aging and dementia [17]. The Betula data used for the
present study is described more in detail elsewhere [2]. At the first data collection in 1988–
1990 (T1), an equal number of men and women, distributed among 10 age cohorts (all 35, 40,
45, . . . 80 years of age), were randomly sampled from the general population in the municipal-
ity of Umeå for a final sample of 1,000 participants. At the first follow-up, in 1993–1995 (T2),
two new cohorts were included: sample 2 (S2; n = 995), with the same age and sex distribution
as S1 at T1, and sample 3 (S3; n = 963), with the same age and sex distribution as S1 at the time
of T2 (all 40, 45, 50, . . . 85 years). To date, data collection has been conducted six times with
5-year intervals between the follow-ups (T1, 1988–1990; T2, 1993–1995; T3, 1998–2000; T4,
2003–2005; T5, 2008–2010; T6, 2013–2014). At each test point (T1–T6), the investigation was
split into two occasions; a health questionnaire was administered on the first occasion and a
cognitive evaluation was made on the second. Between the first and second testing, study par-
ticipants filled out a battery of self-assessment forms covering various socioeconomic, health,
aging, and personality traits.[17] In the event of pathological findings, the study physician
(Rolf Adolfsson, RA) was consulted, and if deemed necessary, the participant was referred to
his/her primary health care practitioner for follow-up. The cognitive test battery included
tasks to assess episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory, the perceptual repre-
sentation system, prospective memory, visual attention, processing speed, problem solving,
and decision-making. The present study starts at T2, why data on participants gathered at T2
were considered baseline information (Fig 1). The start of follow-up was thus 1993–1995 and
the end of follow-up was 30th of June 2010.
Dementia diagnoses
In the Betula study, dementia status was assessed at baseline and reassessed every 5 years to
identify new cases and to determine the year in which the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical

 Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition) core criteria for dementia were met, that is, when
cognitive symptoms became sufficiently severe to interfere with social functioning and with
instrumental activities of daily living (American Psychiatric Association 2000). The medical
records from all hospital and primary care visits within the county were continuously evalu-
ated over the entire study period. The diagnoses were based on observations obtained at the
Betula study visits (health and cognitive evaluations) supplemented with medical record data.
Available clinical results from magnetic resonance imaging, computerized tomography scans,
and autopsy (not part of the Betula protocol) were also considered in the diagnostic decision.
The Betula study population (n = 4,445) was evaluated in this manner with regard to dementia
after each test wave (T1, T2, T3, T4, T5). Evaluation of T6 has not been completed at the time
of writing. The diagnostic evaluations were coordinated by the same senior research geropsy-
chiatrist (RA) throughout the study period.
In 2011, an extensive quality assurance assessment of the dementia diagnoses in the Betula
study was performed. In this assessment, a blinded re-evaluation was made of the medical rec-
ords of those with an established dementia diagnosis with regard to dementia status, subtype,
and age at onset [18]. 444 individuals with a dementia diagnosis were reevaluated by blinded
investigators. The reevaluated diagnoses were based on a minimum of 5 years additional infor-
mation about the course of the disease. As part of the Betula protocol, the following predeter-
mined criteria, which were recorded at the health and cognitive examinations, were used as a
guide for an extended evaluation as determined by the senior geropsychiatrist (RA): Mini
Mental State Examination (MMSE) score � 23, a decline in cognitive performance compared
with a previous test occasion (from high to average/low or from average to low), a decline in
daily functional activities or a subjective loss of memory function expressed by the participant
in the semi-structured interview and any other behavioral or cognitive deviations such as con-
fusion or disorientation noticed by the testing team.
Of the 1,806 participants included in the present study, 302 were diagnosed with either AD
(n = 191) or vascular dementia (n = 111) before or during T5. In this context, it should be
noted that a dementia diagnosis given to a participant from the S1 or S3 cohorts was based on
both clinical examinations and medical record data obtained between 1993 and 2011, whereas
for the S2 participants, a dementia diagnosis given in T4 was based solely on information
obtained from medical records because these participants were not followed up after that
point.
Exposure modelling
To obtain estimates of exposure to source-specific PM2.5, we used data on the annual mean
concentration of PM2.5 for 1990, 2000 and 2010, calculated by the Swedish Meteorological and
Hydrological Institute (SMHI), described in detail elsewhere[16]. The concentrations were
estimated using a wind model and a Gaussian air quality dispersion model. Road networks
were described with a high level of detail, and measured traffic flow for heavy and light vehicles
was collected separately by SMHI for most major roads and elsewhere was completed using
SMHI’s modelled traffic flow. The vehicle fleet composition was derived from the National
Vehicle Registry. Vehicles were grouped into passenger cars (petrol, diesel, ethanol, gas), light
commercial vehicles (petrol and diesel), heavy goods vehicles (petrol and diesel) and buses
(diesel, bio gas, and ethanol). Emission factors for exhaust for different vehicle types, speeds
and driving conditions were calculated based on the Handbook Emission Factors for Road
Transport (HBEFA) 3,1[19]. To obtain estimates of PM2.5 from residential heating, SMHI
used a detailed emission inventory according to chimney-sweepers was collected by the

 emissions to be represented as point sources. A total of 10,287 appliances (2006–2009) were
represented as point sources within the assessment area. Emission factors are based on mea-
surements reported by Todorovic [20], but adjusted following discussions by Nussbaumer
[21], regarding different measurement technologies. The inventory was validated through a
monitoring campaign in and around Umeå, with focus on areas with significant impact from
small scale residential heating. In addition, a survey regarding wood consumption and firing
habits was carried out, allowing estimation of the average wood consumption for different
heating appliances. Further details regarding emission factors, validation of the inventory and
the survey is presented by Omstedt et al. [22]. In our study area, the local particle emissions
from residential heating were totally dominated by the wood burning, [16] why this particle
source hereafter is labelled as “residential wood burning”. The model grids had an original spa-
tial resolution of 3200x3200 m, but as the areas became more urban the resolution was succes-
sively improved to 50 m x 50 m. The main local contributors to combustion PM2.5 emissions
were road traffic (vehicle exhaust) and residential wood burning.
The categories of stoves or boilers obtained from the chimney sweepers were: “wood stoves”
(“open fireplace” or “cottage” were added), “wood boilers often used”, “wood boilers less often
used”, “wood pellet boilers”, and “oil boilers”, “open fireplace” and “cottage”. The pellet and
oil boilers were very rare, so we merged those categories in the analysis. Wood boilers are large
appliances connected to the heating system of the house. Woods stoves are mostly used for
pleasure and heating of smaller segments of the house. We merged “open fireplace” and “cot-
tage” into the category “wood stoves”. We then linked the concentrations provided by SMHI
to the geocoded home address of the Betula study participants as of December each year in
1990, 2000 and 2010 according to the Population Register. We also linked the home address of
the study participants to information from the register of stoves and boilers to obtain informa-
tion on individual access to stoves or boilers.
Statistical analysis
Cox proportional hazards models were used with time as the underlying scale to calculate haz-
ard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dementia incidence in association
with annual mean concentrations of PM2.5 from residential wood burning, traffic exhaust, and
with type of stove or boiler. The mean follow-up time was 11.4 years. The two PM2.5 variables
(vehicle exhaust and residential wood burning) were included in the statistical models simulta-
neously, both as continuous and categorical (quartiles) variables. We also created a new expo-
sure variable by combining PM2.5 from residential wood burning with the presence of a wood
stove in the home. Modelled annual PM2.5 levels at the residential address at study entrance
were used as a proxy for long-term exposure to air pollution.
To reduce potential bias from residual confounding PM2.5 estimates were adjusted for the
same set of potential confounding variables we used in our previous study [2]. These were: the
categorical variables education level (low, medium, high), physical activity (low versus
medium plus high), smoking (current versus former or non-smoker), sex (male versus female),
body mass index (overweight versus non-overweight), waist-hip ratio (>recommended versus
�recommended), alcohol (yes, no never, no quit), and age (55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85–95). Due
to limited statistical power, we chose not to do any subgroup-analyses or interaction-analyses
except that we stratified the analysis on sex. For more reasoning behind our choices of poten-
tial confounders, see our previous study [2]. We analyzed complete-case data. In an additional
analysis, we adjusted the estimates for type of stove or boiler “none”, “wood stove”, “wood
boiler often used”, “wood boilers less often used”, “pellet or oil”).

 All participants in the Betula study gave written informed consent, and the study was
approved by the Regional Ethics Review Board at Umeå University with DNR: 2012-12-31M.
Results
Participants in S1 who had died, had received a dementia diagnosis, were lost to follow-up, or
had left the study for other reasons before T2 were excluded (n = 155). At baseline (T2), the
three samples consisted of 2,803 individuals without dementia; S1 (n = 845), S2 (n = 995), and
S3 (n = 963). Participants less than 55 years of age at T2 (n = 973) were thereafter excluded
because of their low risk of developing dementia within the coming 15-year follow-up period.
Participants with addresses that could not be geocoded (n = 24) were also excluded from fur-
ther analysis. Thus, the final sample consisted of 1,806 individuals (Fig 1).
The local contributions to PM2.5 of residential wood burning and vehicle exhaust in the
study area are shown in Fig 2, with clear differences in gradients between the two sources
(modelled annual average contribution to PM2.5 during 2011 from road traffic exhaust to the
left and small scale residential heating, mostly wood-burning to the right; Fig 2).
An example of the detailed data on emissions of PM2.5 related to residential wood combus-
tion in the study area is shown in Fig 3.
Descriptive data on all variables, including missing data, are shown in Table 1. The associa-
tions between dementia and source-specific PM2.5 are shown in Tables 2 and 3, in models
adjusted for other risk factors, and including PM2.5 from both traffic exhaust and wood burn-
ing as separate variables. For example, the hazard ratio (HR) for dementia associated with a
1 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 from residential wood burning (independent of PM2.5 from traffic
exhaust) was 1.55 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.00–2.41, p-value 0.05; Table 2). Partici-
pants with a wood stove who lived in an area that was classified as the highest quartile of emis-
sions from residential wood burning had a statistically significantly higher risk of dementia
than participants without a stove who lived in the first three quartiles of emissions from

 residential wood burning (HR = 1.74, CI: 1.10–2.75, p-value 0.02, Table 3). The HR was for
men 2.59 (95% CI: 1.34–5.00, p-value 0.01) and for women 1.25 (95% CI: 0.62–2.54, p-
value > 0.30), which indicates a difference between men and women, but the p-value for effect
modification was not statistically significant (p > 0.30). Particulate matter from traffic exhaust
was associated with dementia incidence with hazard ratios of 1.66, (CI: 1.16–2.39, p-value
0.01), and 1.41 (CI: 0.97–2.23, p-value 0.07), in the third and fourth quartiles, respectively
(Table 2).
Discussion
Although previous work has indicated a link between air pollution and dementia incidence,
evidence is not yet present to clearly pinpoint which pollutants are the probable causal agents.
In particular, the effect of other sources of air pollution than traffic, such as air pollution due
to residential wood burning has yet to be explored. Our results provide evidence that not only
is particulate matter from traffic exhaust associated with dementia incidence, which supports
previous findings on (mainly traffic-related) air pollution, [2–6] but particulate matter from
residential wood burning also seem to be associated with dementia incidence in our study
area. Previous studies had no source-specific data on air pollution, so this is the first study to
separate air pollution from different sources. The high spatial resolution of the air pollution
model in the present study resolves intra-city gradients and is expected to increase the

 accuracy of exposure estimates, especially for sources located in residential areas. The spatial
distribution of exposure caused by the two main local sources of PM–road traffic and small
scale residential wood burning–was very different, allowing the impact of the different sources
to be separated.
Our results suggest a dose-response association between PM2.5 from wood smoke and
dementia. The quartile point estimates suggest an association in the highest quartile although
it is not statistically significant. This may be due to statistical power. For the vehicle exhaust,
the point estimates suggest an association in quartile 3 and 4, similar to what we saw in our
previous study [2]. There is no evidence for a dose-response association though (linear

 estimate close to 1). Our findings on vehicle exhaust is basically reproducing the results from
our previous study (here we look at PM2.5 from vehicle exhaust, which should be highly corre-
lated with NOx, which was the exposure indicator in the previous study).
A direct mechanistic pathway between exposure to air pollution and neurodegenerative dis-
eases are plausible, but not yet fully understood. Experimental studies on animal data suggest
that PM may reach the brain via circulation or via the olfactory bulb [23–25]. Experimental
data further link exposure to air pollution to multiple pathways crucial to dementia pathogene-
sis [26–31]. A possible, but less established, pathway is that ambient pollutants increase the
risk for dementia indirectly, via cardiovascular effects [32–36]. We have previously seen how-
ever that cardiovascular diseases did not seem to be the main pathway between air pollution
exposure and dementia [2].
It is well established that biomass burning emits health-damaging pollutants, including sev-
eral carcinogenic compounds [8]. Indoor wood smoke at high doses is a well-established cause
of morbidity and mortality but due to lack of exposure data there have been no epidemiologi-
cal population-based studies on exposure to wood smoke in association with mortality and
health. However, PM from wood burning has been estimated to cause a larger or comparable
number of annual deaths (depending on location and risk estimate used) than traffic-related
air pollution in Sweden [16]. The biomass contribution to air pollution levels in small country
towns in Sweden can be comparable to the most polluted street canyons in the capital Stock-
holm [12]. Biomass burning is increasing in Europe due to climate mitigation policies, but
possible health effects of such policy are not known [14, 15]. Our results imply biomass burn-
ing as a neglected but possible detrimental contribution to air pollution exposure that merits
further attention.
Participants who both lived in areas with the highest quartile of PM2.5 from residential
wood burning, and had a wood stove in their homes (which should be the group with highest
exposure to PM2.5 from residential wood burning), had substantially higher dementia inci-
dence than other participants (HR of 1.74, CI: 1.10–2.75). Most of the households in quartiles
1 to 3 of exposure from residential wood burning were located in areas with district (long-dis-
tant) heating, and we know from a previous interview study that stoves and boilers in such
areas were used to a lesser extent [22]. Furthermore, wood stoves are found indoors and are
likely to generate a higher personal exposure than wood boilers. An analysis that was stratified
by sex indicated that the risk increase seemed even higher in men (HR = 2.59, CI: 1.34–5.08).
A possible explanation for this could be that men have higher exposure than women, for exam-
ple if males are more prone to handle the boilers and stoves than women. Compared with our
previous study, [2] the effect estimates associated with the continuous exposure in the current
study may seem high, but that is because the current model only considers local sources, and
the local contribution consist of a small fraction of the total concentrations of air pollutants.
The major strength of the study is the new, detailed, exposure models and the assessment of
diagnosis. The diagnosis is well-validated and not relying solely on hospital-records of diagno-
sis. The detailed data on air pollution (PM2.5) from residential wood burning has not been
used before in studies on air pollution and dementia, and we are not aware of any application
of dispersion models with as detailed data on residential wood burning outside Sweden (in
Southern Sweden there is one similar model). The model has high spatial resolution and high
accuracy, meaning that we could assess exposure on a very detailed level. However, it would
have been valuable to have data on individual-level firing habits, since this influences both per-
sonal and neighborhood exposure [22]. A possible limitation though is that we used the con-
centrations of PM2.5 for the inclusion year in this study, similar to what we did in our previous
study [2]. It would be interesting to also investigate cumulative exposure during follow-up
given the nature of dementia, which might increase the risk of exposure misclassification. The

 probability of changing residential address may increase at symptom onset, when the individ-
ual may not be able to reside in their old home anymore, whereas the diagnosis may come
years later. Exposure misclassification is always a potential source of bias in studies on expo-
sure to air pollution and health. People are not always at their residences or spend little time
outdoors (where air pollution is modelled) and they may be exposed to other sources of air
pollution that we cannot account for in our analysis. In this study we were able to adjust for
type of stove or boiler (and the estimates did not change much), but there are other sources of
air pollution that we could not take into account. Exposure misclassification can in theory cre-
ate bias both away and towards the null, and it is difficult to completely rule out differential
exposure misclassification as an explanation of findings in all studies of air pollution and
health. However, the spatial distribution of road traffic and small scale residential wood burn-
ing was very different, and differential exposure misclassification most likely would vary
between the two sources. Exposure misclassification as an explanation for our findings regard-
ing therefore seem unlikely. Furthermore, residual confounding must always be considered in
observational studies. We considered several potential confounding factors, but only adjust-
ment for age had any substantial influence on the association between the exposures and
dementia incidence. Factors related to socioeconomic status, such as education and smoking,
had no influence on the observed associations. In all studies of traffic-related air pollution as a
risk factor for incident disease, residual confounding from unknown geographically varying
urban factors is always difficult to rule out. In the present study, traffic noise could be such a
factor. However, Power and colleagues emphasize that their review suggests residual con-
founding is unlikely to account for the consistently positive results between exposure to air
pollution and dementia-related outcomes that have so far observed [7]. The results of our
study support that statement, as the geographical gradients in air pollution from residential
wood burning are substantially different from traffic-related gradients (Fig 2), and we observe
associations with particles from both residential wood burning and vehicle exhaust. For resid-
ual confounding from a geographically varying factor to explain our results, there would thus
have to be two different such factors, which seems unlikely. Furthermore, in their review
Power and colleagues identify no major limitations with our previous study, which was identi-
cal to the present study except the new more detailed exposure data [7].
The results of the present study cannot be generalized to those invited to the Betula study
who declined to participate, and participation tends to depend on socio-economic status, age
and sex. Air pollution is a complex mixture that varies in time and space, and the generalizabil-
ity of the results from studies on air pollution and health are always difficult to assess. The
source-specific air pollution estimates in the present study should increase the generalizability
of the results compared to studies where exposure is less specific however. We have earlier
ruled out non-informative censoring to be a plausible explanation for the association between
traffic-related air pollution and incident dementia [2]. The levels of particulate air pollution
from residential wood burning seem similar in the deceased as in the entire study, (Table 1)
why differential mortality due to exposure does not explain our findings.
In conclusion, if the associations we observed are causal, then air pollution from residential
wood burning, and air pollution from traffic, might be independent important risk factors for
cardiovascular dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Given that this is the first study on exposure
to residential wood burning and dementia incidence, the results should be corroborated by
others.
