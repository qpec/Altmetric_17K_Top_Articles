OBJECTIVES: For asthma, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism 
spectrum disorder (ASD), the objectives were to: (1) describe percent increases in 
parent-reported lifetime prevalence and comorbidity over time and how these vary by 
socioeconomic status and (2) examine the extent poverty status is a predictor of higher-
than-average comorbidities.
METHODS: Secondary analyses of the National Survey of Children’s Health for years 2003, 
2007, and 2011–2012 were conducted to identify trends in parent-reported prevalence and 
comorbid chronic health conditions from a list provided in the survey among children with 
asthma, ADHD, and ASD, and we examined variation by sociodemographic characteristics 
and insurance coverage. By using 2011–2012 data, multivariable regression was used to 
examine whether poverty status predicted higher-than-average comorbid conditions after 
adjusting for other sociodemographic characteristics.
RESULTS: Parent-reported lifetime prevalence of asthma and ADHD between 2003 and 2011–
2012 rose 21% and 43%, respectively, whereas the parent-reported prevalence of ASD rose 
32% between 2007 and 2011–2012. The percent increase in asthma was higher among girls 
and uninsured children. For ADHD, the rise in parent-reported prevalence only varied by 
age. Being poor was associated with nearly twice the adjusted odds (adjusted odds ratio = 
1.72) of having at least 1 comorbidity among children with asthma and more than twice the 
adjusted odds (adjusted odds ratio = 2.60) of having at least 2 comorbidities among children 
with ADHD.
CONCLUSIONS: Poverty status differentially influenced parent-reported lifetime prevalence 
of comorbidities for these target disorders. Future research is needed to examine how 
poverty influences lack of access and chronic stress and exposure on children to induce 
comorbidities, especially mental disorders.

 Poverty negatively affects the 
development and well-being of 
children and adolescents in a variety 
of ways. Poor children are often 
exposed to inadequate nutrition, 
violence, and environmental toxins 
among other risk factors.1 Children in 
poverty with chronic conditions also 
are more likely to have higher rates 
of comorbid disorders and worse 
outcomes.2 
– 
4 Nevertheless, it is less 
clear whether the rate of chronic 
comorbidities among children living 
in poverty is rising and whether 
the trends in chronic conditions are 
differentially influenced by poverty 
status.
These questions are of significance 
because the overall expenditure in 
the Supplemental Security Income 
(SSI) program for children in 2015 
was $10.5 billion.5 Established in the 
1970s, the SSI program for children 
with disabilities was created to 
provide income support to families 
living under or near the federal 
poverty level (FPL). The program 
recently experienced controversy 
because of its large growth, especially 
among children with mental health 
disorders. This controversy resulted 
in a Government Accountability 
Office report6 and a National 
Academies of Sciences, Engineering, 
and Medicine7 report that recognized 
the challenges in identifying 
comorbidities among children 
receiving SSI benefits.8 However, no 
data to our knowledge have been 
published utilizing national data 
sets to estimate the prevalence of 
common chronic health conditions 
and comorbidities among those in 
poverty utilizing income data as 
a potential proxy for SSI recipient 
status.
In addition, the prevalence rates 
of asthma, attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and 
autism spectrum disorder (ASD) 
have significantly increased for more 
than a decade, mirroring trends in 
overall chronic health conditions in 
children and in the SSI program.6, 
 
9 
– 
11 
Children with chronic diseases, such 
as these target conditions, are also 
at higher risk for comorbid physical 
and mental health conditions that 
are chronic in nature and add to the 
disease burden for the child, 
4, 
 
12 
– 
14  
which are often associated with 
the substantial rise in their medical 
costs.15 
– 
23 Additionally, the well-
established relationship between 
childhood poverty and greater risk 
for chronic conditions including 
developmental and behavioral 
disorders2, 
 
24 
– 
28 may place children 
living in low-income families in 
double jeopardy of greater need for 
care and poorer access to care.29, 
30 
This rise in disease risk is coupled 
with an overall increase in childhood 
poverty within this time period.31
Although of high public health 
significance, there is a paucity of 
information regarding the prevalence 
trends of comorbid disorders such 
as depression and anxiety among 
US children with asthma, ADHD, 
and ASD and the extent poverty 
influences their rates of comorbid 
chronic conditions. To address this 
knowledge gap, we conducted a data 
analysis by using the 3 waves of the 
National Survey of Children’s Health 
(NSCH) from 2003 through 2011–
2012. For these 3 target conditions, 
the study objectives were to: (1) 
describe the percent increases in 
prevalence and comorbidity and how 
these vary by poverty status and (2) 
examine the extent to which poverty 
status is a predictor of higher-than-
average comorbid conditions.

Data source
The data source is the NSCH and 
includes data from the survey 
administration for the years 2003, 
2007, and 2011–2012.32 
– 
34 The 
NSCH was designed to provide cross-
sectional national prevalence estimates 
of a large number of health indicators 
for children and uses the State and 
Local Area Integrated Telephone 
Survey Program.32– 
34 Additionally, 
cell phone sampling methods were 
newly employed in 2011–2012. The 
completion rate was 65.8% in 2003, 
66.0% in 2007, and 54.1% for the 
landline sample and 41.2% for the 
cell phone sample in 2011–2012.3 Of 
the 95 677 completed interviews in 
2011–2012, 31 972 were conducted 
with respondents’ cell phones, with no 
expected nonresponse bias from cell 
versus landline.32,

study Variable construction
Children were identified as having 
asthma, ADHD, or ASD if their 
primary caregiver reported that 
their child had ever been diagnosed 
with the condition. In addition, 
children were classified as having 
at least 1 comorbid condition if 
their primary caregiver reported an 
additional chronic condition. The 
list of comorbid conditions a parent 
could identify used in this analysis 
included: bone, joint, and/or muscle 
problems; vision and/or hearing 
problems; depression and/or anxiety; 
learning disability; diabetes; asthma 
(for ADHD and ASD); and ADHD (for 
asthma and ASD). There were some 
important methodological differences 
for several of the condition questions 
between the 2003 to the 2007 and 
2011–2012 surveys leading to the 
exclusion of a number of chronic 
conditions listed in the survey. In 
addition, in the 2003 survey, the 
indicator on ASD only asked if the 
child had ever received a diagnosis of 
autism, whereas in 2007 and 2011–
2012, the question was expanded to 
include Asperger disorder, pervasive 
developmental disorder, or other 
ASD. As a result, analyses in which 
the ASD indicator were used were 
limited to comparisons between 
2007 and 2011–2012. Another 
methodological change was that the 
vision and/or hearing problems and 
depression and/or anxiety questions 
from 2003 were split into separate 
condition questions for 2007 and 
2011–2012. For our analyses,

 these conditions were regrouped 
and treated as single indicators for 
analysis of 2007 and 2011–2012 
data to remain comparable to the 
2003 data. Sociodemographic 
characteristics of the child were 
identified by parent report. Child age 
was classified into 3 groups: (1) 3 to 
5 years, (2) 6 to 11 years, and (3) 12 
to 17 years, and race and/or ethnicity 
was categorized as: (1) white non-
Hispanic, (2) black non-Hispanic, (3) 
Hispanic, and (4) other.36 Poverty 
levels were categorized by using FPL 
standards: (1) <100 FPL (poor), (2) 
100% to 199% FPL (near poor), (3) 
200% to 399% FPL, and (4) ≥400% 
FPL. Insurance coverage categories 
were private, public, and uninsured.
Data analysis
Survey weights and multiple 
imputation files provided by the 
National Center for Health Statistics 
were employed.37 For each target 
condition, weighted parent-reported 
prevalence was calculated in each 
survey year by age, sex, race and/or 
ethnicity, poverty status, and insurance 
coverage. χ2 tests were used for within-
group differences, and Wald F tests 
were used to test the significance of 
year by group interaction terms to 
identify differences in time trends 
across subgroups. For each target 
condition, the rates of comorbid 
conditions were compared for children 
living >200% and <200% of the FPL. 
By using the 2011–2012 sample, 
multivariate regression analysis was 
conducted to identify associations 
of greater than the average number 
of comorbidities with each target 
condition. Statistical significance was 
set a priori at P < .05. This study was 
deemed exempt by the University of 
Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board.
Results
national Prevalence trends by 
Poverty status
In each of the survey administrations, 
poverty was associated with a 
higher parent-reported prevalence 
of asthma (Supplemental Table 4) 
and ADHD (Supplemental Table 5) 
in a stepwise relationship, such that 
the parent-reported prevalence of 
these conditions was higher among 
children in families with lower 
incomes. The parent-reported 
prevalence of ASD did not differ 
by poverty status (Supplemental 
Table 6). There was a rise in parent-
reported lifetime prevalence of all 3 
target disorders over time (Table 1, 
 
Fig 1). The lifetime parent-reported 
prevalence of asthma rose 21%, from 
13.6% in 2003 to 16.4% in 2011–
2012. For ADHD, the lifetime parent-
reported prevalence increased by 
43%, from 7.2% in 2003 to 10.4% in 
2011–2012, and for ASD the percent 
rise was 32%, from a prevalence of 
1.8% in 2007% to 2.4% in 2011– 
2012 (Supplemental Tables 4–6).
The rise in lifetime parent-reported 
prevalence of asthma of 33% was 
not statistically significantly higher 
among poor children (FPL <100%) 
than children living in less poor 
household. Girls compared with boys 
and the uninsured compared with 
children with insurance had higher 
percentage change in the parent-
reported prevalence of asthma 
(Table 1). For ADHD, the increase in 
lifetime parent-reported prevalence 
did not differ by poverty status but 
did by age. In contrast, increases 
in the lifetime parent-reported 
prevalence of ASD did not differ by 
any sociodemographic status  
variable.
national Prevalence trends of 
comorbid conditions by Poverty 
status
The rise in the extent of parent-
reported comorbid conditions for these 
target conditions was differentially 
influenced by poverty status for 
asthma and ADHD (Table 2). On 
average, children with asthma had 0.61 
parent-reported comorbid condition 
in 2011– 2012, and among poor 
and/or near-poor children, the most 
common comorbid conditions were 
depression and/or anxiety (15.5%), 
ADHD (20.8%), and learning disability 
(20.9%); all 3 of these conditions were 
more prevalent among the poor and/
or near poor than those living >200% 
of the FPL (Supplemental Table 7).
For children identified as having 
ADHD from 2003 to 2011–2012, the 
rise in parent-reported 2 or more 
comorbid conditions significantly 
increased for poor and near-poor 
children (19%), compared with an 8% 
decline among children living >200% 
of the FPL, (P = .01), see Table 2. On 
average, children with ADHD in 2011–
2012 had 1.23 reported comorbid 
conditions, and among the poor and 
near-poor children, the most common 
comorbid conditions were learning 
disability (51.2%), depression or 
anxiety (37.0%), and asthma (32.7%). 
All 3 of these conditions were more 
prevalent among the poor and near 
poor than those living >200% of the 
FPL (Supplemental Table 8).
On average, children with ASD in 
2011–2012 had 2.15 parent-reported 
comorbid conditions, and for poor and 
near-poor children, the most common 
comorbid conditions were learning 
disability (75.6%), ADHD (50.7%), 
and depression or anxiety (45.9%) 
(Supplemental Table 9). There were no 
statistically significant differences in the 
rise in the parent-reported prevalence 
of these conditions, although poor and 
near-poor children more commonly 
had asthma as a comorbid condition 
compared with children living >200% 
of the FPL, P < .05 in both survey 
administration years.
In addition, the percent increase in 
type of parent-reported comorbid 
disorder for each target disorder was 
differentially influenced by poverty 
status (Supplemental Tables 7–9). 
Among children identified as having 
asthma, parent-reported ADHD rose 
50% among the poor and near poor 
and 16% among those living >200% 
of the FPL (Supplemental Table 7). 
Likewise, among children identified as 
having ADHD, parent-reported asthma

 rose 31% among the poor and near 
poor compared with a decline of 4% 
among those living >200% of the FPL 
(Supplemental Table 8). Conversely, for 
children identified as having ASD, no 
statistically significant differences were 
noted for the rate of rise of comorbid 
conditions (Supplemental Table 9).

of higher-than-average comorbid 
conditions
By using 2011–2012 data, children 
identified as having asthma and being 
poor had nearly 2 times the adjusted 
odds of having at least 1 comorbid 
condition compared with their 
counterparts in households with 
incomes >400% of the FPL (Table 3). 
Having public insurance was also 
associated with higher adjusted 
odds of at least 1 comorbidity, but 
minority race was associated with 
lower adjusted odds compared with

 whites. Among children with ADHD, 
those who were poor had higher 
adjusted odds (2.60) of having at 
least 2 comorbid conditions. In 
contrast, for ASD, poverty status 
was not a significant predictor of 
having at least 3 parent-reported 
comorbidities. Public insurance was 
a significant predictor of at least 3 
comorbid conditions (adjusted odds 
ratio = 2.27).
DIscussIOn
Although poverty is a well-
established risk factor for chronic 
health problems, 
2, 
 
38 our findings 
suggest that the national rise in 
parent-reported prevalence of 
asthma, ADHD, and ASD as well as 
comorbid disorders is differentially 
influenced by poverty status, such 
that being poor was predictive of 
higher-than-average comorbid 
conditions for children with asthma 
and ADHD, but not ASD, consistent 
with previous studies.12, 
 
39– 
41 These 
findings underscore the importance 
of increased clinician awareness of 
higher risk for comorbid conditions 
when caring for children with 
asthma and ADHD who are living in 
impoverished households.

 The parent-reported prevalence of 
asthma and ADHD is higher among 
poor children, but the percentage 
change in prevalence over time did 
not statistically differ by poverty 
status. When considering comorbid 
conditions among children with 
asthma and ADHD, poverty was 
predictive of having greater than 
the average number of comorbid 
conditions. In contrast, the percent 
change in the prevalence of ASD 
and presence of comorbidities were 
not associated with poverty. Past 
research has postulated that greater 
parent awareness, better detection, 
less stigma, change in diagnostic 
classification, more financial 
resources, and private insurance may 
help explain our findings.39, 
 
42 Our 
conclusions reinforce the importance 
of clinicians to remain steadfast in 
their evaluation of all children with 
ASD because comorbidities are 
exceedingly common in all income 
groups.15, 
 
40, 
41
Past studies indicate that 
comorbidities can impact a child’s 
overall health and functioning in 
daily life, and children with complex 
health conditions have higher rates  
of unmet need than other children 
with special health care needs.43, 
 
44  
They also have higher rates of 
emotional and behavioral problems 
and mental health disorders than 
other children.45, 
 
46 Unmet needs 
are higher for children with special 
health care needs living in or near 
poverty compared with those living 
>400% the FPL, 
44 and significant 
sociodemographic disparities exist.47, 
 
48  
Minority children have poorer access 
to care and have increased odds of 
suboptimal health.49 For children 
with ADHD, higher numbers of 
comorbidities was associated with 
poorer functioning, and disparities 
in the diagnosis of ASD and access 
to services have been identified.12, 
50 
Coexisting mental health disorders 
increased the cost of care for children 
with ADHD as well.51 The presence 
of comorbidities is associated with 
higher health care costs for children 
with asthma.52 Further research is 
needed to examine how child-level 
(ie, sociodemographics, especially 
race and/or ethnicity), parent-level 
(ie, care burden, distress), and 
system-level characteristics (ie, 
access to mental health and special 
education resources if identified) are 
related to parental reporting of these 
target disorders and comorbidity.
Poverty status also differentially 
impacted the type and number 
of comorbid conditions reported 
by the parent. These data are 
thus also important in evaluating 
support programs for children 
with disabilities, including the SSI 
program, because comorbidities are 
often not accurately recorded and 
may be an important facet of a child’s 
function.8 Of note, our findings are 
similar to the findings of high rates of 
comorbidities among children with 
mental health disorders including 
ADHD and autism in the Medicaid 
population identified by the National 
Academies of Sciences, Engineering, 
and Medicine’s report.7 In addition, 
some of the children with these 
target disorders may have also been 
receiving SSI for a mental health 
impairment. Public insurance was 
a significant predictor of higher-
than-average comorbid disorders 
for asthma and ASD; early and 
periodic screening, diagnosis, and 
treatment standards in Medicaid may 
contribute to this finding.
Although we could not discern 
the causal and temporal nature 
of the relationship of poverty to 
chronic medical conditions and 
comorbidities, it has been well 
established that having a family 
member with a disability increases 
one’s likelihood of being poor. 
Potential reasons why this is true 
include increased out-of-pocket 
health care expenses and the time of 
caretaking away from work.53 
– 
60 This 
is consistent with data on childhood 
poverty, which show an overall 
increase during our study period.61 
These associations have important 
implications on health care utilization 
and cost for children and families 
in poverty and suggest that many 
families are struggling financially to 
care of their children with chronic 
medical conditions.
In this analysis, we also identified 
that after adjustment for income, 
minority race was associated with 
lower odds of higher-than-average 
numbers of comorbidities for 
children with asthma. We note that 
although the diagnosis of asthma has 
been associated with minority race in 
previous studies in regard to overall 
prevalence, 
62 in our study and others 
it is not necessarily associated with 
multiple comorbidities.4 Poverty 
remains the most important risk 
factor for higher-than-average 
comorbidities in this population.
The study has several limitations. 
Utilization of only 3 data points 
through time, and 2 for ASD over 
the period of a decade, limits our 
ability to identify definite trends over 
time. Other weaknesses include the 
challenges in comparing these survey 
findings to other surveys, given 
differences in the methodology of 
survey administration. Additionally, 
we do not know the impact on 
our results of adding cell phone 
methodology in 2011–2012 of the 
NSCH, although current data do 
suggest that there was not evidence 
of any response bias between years 
of survey administration with this 
change.32, 
 
36 The diagnosis of the 
target conditions and comorbid 
chronic conditions were based on 
primary caregiver reports; this 
method has been supported in the 
literature as reliable.32 
–34 We also 
note that some of the comorbid 
conditions listed by caregivers of 
children with ASD and ADHD may 
be considered part of the clinical 
profile of the condition. Lastly, the 
list of chronic conditions included 
on the NSCH that a parent can report 
is limited and was further limited

 in our analysis because of changes 
in question wording between 2003 
and 2011–2012. The list also heavily 
favors mental health conditions 
and excludes some rare conditions 
such as congenital heart disease, 
cystic fibrosis, etc, which may 
underestimate our findings in regard 
to comorbidity.
cOnclusIOns
Poverty differentially influenced 
parent-reported lifetime prevalence 
and comorbidities of children 
with asthma, ADHD, and ASD. For 
children with asthma or ADHD, 
poverty was associated with more 
comorbidity. Future research is 
merited to examine how lack of 
access to health care and the burden 
of living in poverty influences risk 
for comorbidities, especially mental 
disorders. In contrast, increases in 
both prevalence and comorbidities 
among children with ASD were 
similar among all income  
groups.
Understanding the impact of 
comorbid health conditions is also 
an area for additional research to 
develop best practices for health 
assessment and management. 
Attention to comorbidities can 
result in improved quality of life and 
optimal disease control.63, 
 
64 Policies 
that support practitioners, promote 
medical homes, and support children 
and families in poverty or near 
poverty, including strengthening 
current programs such as SSI, should 
be considered to adequately address 
the complex medical needs of these 
children.
